    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4516 Since June 2010 to July 2012 since in Department of Hematology of the University Hospital in Krakow five patients with advanced hematological malignancies have been subjected to allogeneic transplantation from matched related donors with clofarabine as a part of conditioning regimen. Indications for transplantation were relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia in four patients and CML lymphoblastic crisis in relapse after RIC alloPBSCT in one patient. In a case of three patients conditioning regimen consisted of two phases. First phase: cytoreduction with clofarabine 20mg/m2/day + ARA-C 2000 mg/day for 4 days in 2 patients with refractory AML and Clofarabine 20mg/m2/day + Cyclophosphamide 400mg/day for 4 days in one (CML lymphoblastic crisis). Second phase: Busilvex + Fludarabine (Bu4Flu). Two later patients were treated without cytoreduction. One patient with extramedullary AML in second CR was treated with Clofarabine 30mg/m2 for 4 days + TBI. Last patient with early AML relapse was conditioned with Clofarabine30mg/m2 for 5 days+ Busilvex (BuClo). G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood was used as a source of stem cells in all the patients. Results: One patient died during conditioning regimen after cytoreduction (Clofarabine + Cyclophosphamide). It was the patient with CML lymphoblastic crisis relapse after RIC allogeneic transplantation. The other patients treatment toxicity was moderate (mucositis garde I-III). Aplastic period was complicated in one patient with septic infection. One patient relapsed 5 months after transplantation. He was diagnosed with AML secondary to MDN/MPD with very high cytogenetics (t(3;3) with 7 monosomy) Three of patient series remain in complete remission. All of them were diagnosed with relapse/refractory AML with CR duration 6 months to 26 months. Conclusions: Use of clofarabine as a part of conditioning regimen is valuable therapeutic option especially in the group of patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
