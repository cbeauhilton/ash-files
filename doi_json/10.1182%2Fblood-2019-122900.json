    "abstract_text": "Introduction: R/R DLBCL patients who have received \u22652 lines of therapy, including those progressed post stem cell transplantation (SCT) or who are not candidates for SCT, have limited treatment options. Selinexor, a selective oral XPO1 inhibitor leads to nuclear accumulation and activation of tumor suppressor proteins and reductions in c-Myc and Bcl-2 oncogenes. Selinexor plus low dose dexamethasone (Sel-dex) was recently approved in relapsed/refractory myeloma in the United States based on data from the STORM study, wherein Sel-dex induced an overall response rate (ORR) of 26.2% in patients with penta-exposed, triple-class refractory multiple myeloma. We conducted the SADAL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single agent selinexor in patients with R/R DLBCL. In this patient population, selinexor demonstrated deep and durable responses with an overall response rate (ORR) of 28.3% including a 11.0% complete response (CR) rate. The median duration of response (DOR) was 9.2 months. In patients with CR, the DOR was 13.4 months. Here we evaluate the effect of prior therapy on the efficacy and safety of selinexor. Methods: SADAL is a multicenter, open-label study in R/R DLBCL patients with 2-5 prior lines of therapy, who may have progressed post SCT or are not candidates for SCT. Patients were stratified by subtype (germinal center B-cell or non-GCB) and treated with 60 mg selinexor BIW per 28-day cycle. The primary endpoint was ORR. Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR) and safety. We performed post-hoc analyses to compare outcomes based on the number (2 vs. >2) and type (SCT vs. no SCT) of prior lines of therapy received. Results: Of 127 patients, 83 (65%) received 2 prior lines of therapy and 43 (34%) received >2 prior lines of therapy. Thirty-six patients (28%) received prior SCT and 91 (72%) had no prior SCT. In general, patient demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced in both subgroups. ORR was 30.1% vs. 25.6% (P=0.74) in patients with 2 vs >2 prior lines of therapy respectively. The CR rate was 10.8% in patients with 2 prior lines of therapy compared with 11.6% in patients with >2 prior lines of therapy (P=1.00). The median DOR was 9.2 months in patients with 2 prior lines of therapy compared with 8.4 months in those with >2 prior lines of therapy (P=0.64). Median progression free survival was 3.7 months and 1.9 months (P=0.37) and median overall survival was 11.0 months and 9.8 months (P=0.69) in patients with 2 and >2 prior lines of therapy respectively. In patients with prior SCT, the ORR was 44.4% compared with 22.0 % (P=0.02) in patients with no prior SCT. The CR rate was 16.7% in patients with prior SCT compared with 8.8% in patients with no prior SCT (P=0.34). The DOR was 8.4 months in patients with prior SCT and 9.2 months with no prior SCT (P=0.80). Median progression free survival was 5.9 months and 2.3 months (P=0.07) and median overall survival was 9.1 and 9.8 months (P=0.36) in patients with prior SCT and no prior SCT respectively. The most common related adverse events (AEs) [grade \u22653] included thrombocytopenia (2 prior lines: 36%, >2 prior lines: 42%; prior SCT: 58%, no prior SCT: 31%), neutropenia (2 prior lines: 19%, >2 lines: 23%; prior SCT: 25%, no prior SCT: 20%), and anemia (2 prior lines: 15%, >2 prior lines: 14%, prior SCT: 17%, no prior SCT: 14%). Treatment-related serious AEs were reported in 23%, 14%, 25%, and 19% of patients with 2 prior lines, >2 prior lines, prior SCT, and no prior SCT respectively. Conclusions: Single agent oral selinexor with its novel mechanism of action demonstrated deep and durable responses with no new safety signals regardless of prior therapy. Patients with 2 prior lines of therapy had a higher response rate (30.1% vs. 25.6%) compared with those with >2 prior lines of therapy. The greatest benefit, with an ORR of 44.4% was observed in patients with prior SCT. Collectively, these data support the clinical benefit of single agent selinexor and importantly in earlier lines of therapy. Further evaluation of selinexor in combination with other agents to improve outcomes in R/R DLBCL is ongoing.
