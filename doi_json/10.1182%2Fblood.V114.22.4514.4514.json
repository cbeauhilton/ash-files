    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4514 Introduction Ischemic cerebrovascular disease (ICD) is a multifactorial entity whose anatomopathological substrate is the pro-inflammatory state links to atherosclerosis. The inflammatory cells migrate to vascular endothelium unleashing atheroma plaque formation and pro-inflammatory cytoquine release. Objective The purpose of this case-control study is to analyze the ICD risk associated to polymorphisms MCP-1 -2518 G/A, IL6 -174 G/C, IL 1B -511 C/T, IL1B +3954 C/T, IL1A -889 C/T. Methods and patients A total of 282 ICD diagnosed patients (134 female and 148 male; mean age 68,2\u00b114,9 years) and 287 controls without thrombotic history (143 Female and 144 male; mean age 65,8\u00b114 years) were analysed. AH, DM, dyslipidemia and smoking habit data were collected for each group. Polymorphisms were analysed by PCR-RFLP. Seric IL6 was measured by ELISA. Statistic Analysis was made with Stata v.10 software. Results Stroke subtype distribution was: atherothrombotic (32,8%), inhabitual and indeterminate (28,9%), cardioembolic (24,5%), and lacunar (13,7%). Risk factors were more frequent in patients with AH and DM showed a higher prevalence: (OR: 1.684 IC 95%:1.161- 2.443, p:0.006) and (OR: 2.393, IC95%:1.447- 3.956, p:0.01) respectively. Logistic regression was used to determinate polymorphisms distribution. Results are shown in table 1 . Analysis of IL-1 polymorphisms showed a synergic relation in IL1A -889 C/T (p:0.05; OR: 0.625; IC95%:0.388-1.008). The G allele IL6 \u2013174 G/C carriers group presented higher seric IL6 levels than C allele carriers, 5.85 pg/ml (2.9- 34.5) vs 4.94pg/ml (2.5- 11.4) respectively. IL-6 genotype frequency G/G + G/C vs C/C was analyzed. Atherothrombotic stroke IL-6 genotype frequency was G/G + G/C (24.3%) vs C/C (12.0%) (p: 0.082). Conclusion There is no association between MCP-1 -2518 G/A, IL6 -174 G/C, IL 1B -511 C/T, IL1B +3954 C/T, IL1A -889 C/T polymorphisms and ischemic stroke. We found a synergic effect between IL1 mutations. The G allele IL6 \u2013174 G/C carriers group presented higher seric IL6 levels than C allele carriers. The analysis performed by ICD subtypes showed an association between IL6 G allele and atherothrombotic subtype. * SETH and MMA GRANT Table 1  . p . OR . IC 95% .
