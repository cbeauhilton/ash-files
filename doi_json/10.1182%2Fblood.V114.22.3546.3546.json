    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3546 Poster Board III-483 CD34 + cells from diabetic patients demonstrate reduced vascular reparative function due to decreased proliferation as well as diminished migration prowess which is largely due to lower levels of bioavailable nitric oxide (NO). We asked whether a transient TGF-\u03b21 blockade in CD34 + cells from diabetics would improve their reparative ability given that TGF-\u03b2 is a key factor modulating stem cell quiescence. Peripheral blood lin-CD34 + cells or lin-CD34+CD38+/\u2212 cells were treated ex vivo with antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (TGF-\u03b21 -PMO), demonstrated to inhibit TGF-\u03b21 protein expression in stem cells. Cells were then analyzed for cell surface TGF-\u03b2 Receptor 2 (TGF-\u03b2 R2) and CXCR4 expression, their ability to generate NO, their ability to migrate toward SDF-1, their ability to survive in the absence of added growth factors, and tested in vivo for their vascular reparative ability. After TGF-\u03b21-PMO treatment, healthy and diabetic CD34+CD38+ and - cells downregulated TGF-\u03b2R2, upregulated CXCR4 expression, survived in the absence of added growth factors ex vivo and migrated more efficiently to SDF-1 compared to controls. TGF-\u03b21-PMO treated diabetic CD34 + cells restored NO production to non-diabetic levels. In contrast, TGF-\u03b21-PMO did not enhance NO generation in CD34+ cells from healthy subjects. Using an in vivo retinal ischemia reperfusion model, we observed that TGF-\u03b21-PMO treatment increased the ability of both healthy and diabetic CD34 + cells to home to injured capillaries compared to control PMO treated cells. As also observed in our current study, a reduction of TGF-\u03b21 levels in murine hematopoietic stem cells correlates with a reduction in TGF-\u03b2R2 expression which may induce proliferation in vivo . We also show that both diabetic and healthy lin-CD34+CD38+ cells express TGF-\u03b2R2 by FACS. In contrast, only healthy lin-CD34+CD38- cells expressTGF-\u03b2R2 while diabetic lin-CD34+CD38 - cells express essentially no cell surface TGF-\u03b2R2 (<5 % of cells are TGF-\u03b2R2+). Our results suggest that a transient blockade of TGF-\u03b21 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy in restoring vascular reparative function in diabetic CD34+ cells.
