    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4277 OBJECTIVES: Effectiveness of rituximab maintenance treatment among patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) has been established in a randomised setting (EORTC20981 trial). Although the golden standard, results might not be generalisable to unselected real-world patient populations. Outcomes research was conducted to calculate real-world cost-effectiveness of second line rituximab maintenance compared to observation in FL patients in the Netherlands. METHODS: Two Dutch population-based registries, PHAROS and HemoBase respectively, collected information on patient characteristics, treatment, and resource utilisation on patients diagnosed with FL in the past 20 years. Patients responding to second line chemotherapy were included in the observation or maintenance group. A Markov model was applied to calculate real-world cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Although 735 FL patients entered the registries, only 57 and 49 patients were eligible and included in the observation and maintenance group, respectively. Median age was 61 years and similar in both groups. Differences between the groups were found for second line treatment with rituximab (77% and 92% in the observation and maintenance group p<0.05) and years since diagnosis (p<0.01). Besides, the proportion of people with a partial response was higher in the observation group (60%) compared to the maintenance group (33%). The maintenance group showed higher 3-year overall survival (75% versus 63%) and longer time till next treatment (p<0.01). Compared to the trial, our real-world population was older and fewer patients were diagnosed with stage IV FL. Real-world prescription of rituximab was comparable to the trial although cycles were prescribed more frequent. Daily practice data combined with trial efficacy data resulted in cost-effectiveness ratios between \u20ac 3,614 and \u20ac 5,246 per life year gained and \u20ac3,555 and \u20ac 5,156 per quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSIONS: Real-world FL patients were not identical to trial patients emphasising the importance of studying real-world data. Nevertheless, these data also suggest that rituximab is an effective treatment in daily life. However, analysing non-randomised groups is challenging. Careful interpretation is required since observed dissimilarities between the groups suggested the representation of different types of patients. Nevertheless, real-world cost-effectiveness for second line rituximab maintenance was favourable compared to other haematological treatments. Disclosures: Pompen: Roche Netherlands: Employment.
