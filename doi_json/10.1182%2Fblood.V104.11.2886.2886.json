    "abstract_text": "Use of Natural Killer (NK) cells in cellular immunotherapy requires processing of large numbers of NK cells in a closed system consisting of clinical grade components. We have previously developed a two step NK cell isolation process in which the CliniMACS\u00ae plus Instrument and CliniMACS\u00ae CD3 and CD56 Reagents are used for CD3 + cell depletion and subsequent CD56 + cell enrichment, respectively. We have recently optimized the CD3 depletion step for very large scale cell processing by development of the CliniMACS\u00ae Depletion Tubing Set (\u201cDTS\u201d) and appropriate cell separation software, reducing the processing time of the CD3 depletion step by 50%. We now have developed the CliniMACS\u00ae MARRS Tubing Set (MARRS = MAgnetic Reagent Removal System), a tubing set which includes a cross-flow filtration module for removal of unbound magnetic reagent after magnetic labelling. The cross-flow filtration module allows to directly connect a magnetically labelled cell product to the tubing set without centrifugational washing steps, reducing the processing time by 45 minutes. We isolated CD56 + cells from buffy coats as well as apheresis harvests using the CliniMACS\u00ae MARRS Tubing Set as compared to the standard CliniMACS\u00ae Tubing Set. Both tubing sets (MARRS vs. standard) yielded CD56 + cells of comparable purity (94.1% vs. 92.3%), comparable depletion of CD56 \u2212 CD3 + T cells (3.2 log vs. 3.0 log) and comparable recovery (72.9% vs. 76.7%) with a trend towards better performance of the CliniMACS\u00ae MARRS Tubing Set. To assess the functionality of CliniMACS\u00ae separated CD56 + cells we performed flow cytometric cytotoxicity tests against the MHC class I negative target cell line K562. Specific killing could be increased from <2% (unseparated sample) to 47% (MARRS) and 53% (standard) at an effector to target ratio of 50:1. Thus, K562 killing cells are efficiently enriched and cytotoxicity is similar for both CD56 + cells isolated using the standard CliniMACS\u00ae Tubing Set and the CliniMACS\u00ae MARRS Tubing Set. We additionally assessed whether the killing efficiency of CD56 + cells correlates with NK receptor expression (NCR, KIR, NKG2D, costimulatory molecules) on different NK and NKT subsets. Results of these analyses will be presented. We conclude that the CliniMACS\u00ae MARRS Tubing Set can be used to efficiently isolate functional CD56 + cells from buffy coats or medium scale apheresis harvests (e.g. non-mobilized donors), clearly reducing total processing time. For larger scale NK cell selection using apheresis harvests (e.g. mobilized donors) the combination of Depletion Tubing Set for CD3 + cell depletion and the standard CliniMACS\u00ae Tubing Set for CD56 + cell enrichment is suitable.",
