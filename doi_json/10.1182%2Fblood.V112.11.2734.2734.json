    "abstract_text": "To facilitate human multiple myeloma (MM) engraftment into NOD/SCID recipients, mice were depleted of CD122 + cells (NK and myeloid cells) by antibody-mediated ablation prior to transplantation with the MM cell lines (RPMI8226, RPMI8226-TGL or U226). The MM engraftment, skeletal MM distribution, osteolysis, lambda chain paraprotein and associating disease symptoms in CD122 + cell-depleted and CD122 + cellreplete mice were compared. The CD122 + cell-depleted mice engrafted at a significantly higher frequency with human CD38 + , CD56 + , PCA-1 + and CD138 + cells. In the CD122 + cell-depleted mice, bioluminescence MM signal involved the whole mouse compared to limited imaging signal in the CD122 + cell-replete mice. The majority 88%\u2013100% of CD122 + cell-depleted mice developed MM engraftment throughout the appendicular and axial skeletons with osteolysis and rare subcutaneous plasmacytomas (11% of mice). Serum paraprotein appeared earlier at 4\u20135 weeks post-transplant in CD122 + cell-depleted mice and continued to increase during the 12\u201313 weeks of analysis. The majority, 92% of CD122 + cell-depleted mice developed hind-limb paralysis and had a significantly shortened 45 day survival. Thus, depletion of CD122 + cells reduced resistance to the human MM and produced a new MM xenograft-NOD/SCID model that recapitulates the clinical manifestations of MM and eliminates the major limitations associated with the published MM xenograft-mouse model.",
