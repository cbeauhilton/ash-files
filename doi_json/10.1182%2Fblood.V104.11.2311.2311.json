    "abstract_text": "Reduced intensity regimens (RIR) have largely replaced conventional myeloablative regimens (CMR) for patients with NHL undergoing allogeneic transplant. However, the impact of dose reduction on relapse has not been extensively studied. We performed a retrospective analysis of 88 patients conditioned with CMR (n=48) and a RIR (n=40) of fludarabine 125mg/m 2 and melphalan 140mg/m 2 . GVHD prophylaxis was with cyclosporine + MTX +/\u2212 prednisone for CMR and cyclosporine + MMF +/\u2212 MTX for the RIR.  . CMR . RIR . P Value .

The 1-year TRM was 38% for CMR and 24% for RIR (p=NS). Kaplan-Meier 2-year OS/PFS for CMR is 52%/48% versus 57%/48% for RIR (p=NS). When analyzed by diagnosis, CMR were significantly associated with decreased RR (10% vs 60%, p=0.004) for intermediate grade B-cell (figure 1). Univariate analysis of patient and treatment-related prognostic factors showed improved survival with chemosensitive disease; treatment intensity was the single predictor of relapse for the entire group, but, when stratified by diagnosis, for intermediate grade B-cell only. In conclusion, CMR provide better disease control for intermediate grade B-cell NHL. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure  Close modal",
