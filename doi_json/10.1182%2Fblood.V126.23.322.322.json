    "abstract_text": "Background: Internal tandem duplications (ITD) in the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 occur in roughly 25% of younger adult patients (pts) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), implicating FLT3 as a potential target for kinase inhibitor therapy. The multi-targeted kinase inhibitor midostaurin shows potent activity against FLT3 as a single agent but also in combination with intensive chemotherapy. Aims: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of midostaurin in combination with intensive induction therapy and as single agent maintenance therapy after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) or high-dose cytarabine (HIDAC). Methods: The study includes adult pts (age 18-70 years (yrs)) with newly diagnosed FLT3 -ITD positive AML enrolled in the ongoing single-arm phase-II AMLSG 16-10 trial (NCT: NCT01477606). Pts with acute promyelocytic leukemia are not eligible. The presence of FLT3 -ITD is analyzed within our diagnostic study AMLSG-BiO (NCT01252485) by Genescan-based fragment-length analysis (allelic ratio >0.05 required to be FLT3 -ITD positive). Induction therapy consists of daunorubicin (60 mg/m\u00b2, d1-3) and cytarabine (200 mg/m\u00b2, continuously, d1-7); midostaurin 50 mg bid is applied from day 8 onwards until 48h before start of the next treatment cycle. A second cycle is optional. For consolidation therapy, pts proceed to alloHSCT as first priority; if alloHSCT is not feasible, pts receive three cycles of age-adapted HIDAC in combination with midostaurin from day 6 onwards. In all pts maintenance therapy for one year is intended. This report focuses on the first cohort of the study (n=149) recruited between June 2012 and April 2014 prior to the amendment increasing the sample size; the amendment to the study is active since October 2014. Results: At study entry patient characteristics were median age 54 years (range, 20-70, 34% \u2265 60 yrs); median white cell count (WBC) 48.4G/l (range 1.1-178G/l); karyotype, n=103 normal, n=3 t(6;9), n=2 t(9;11), n=20 intermediate-2 and n=7 high-risk according to ELN recommendations, n=14 missing; mutated NPM1 n=92 (62%). Data on response to first induction therapy were available in 147 pts; complete remission (CR) 58.5%, partial remission (PR) 20.4%, refractory disease (RD) 15% and death 6.1%. A second induction cycle was given in 34 pts. Overall response after induction therapy was CR 75% and death 7.5%. Adverse events 3\u00b0/4\u00b0 reported during the first induction cycle were most frequently gastrointestinal (n=34) and infections (n=81). During induction therapy midostaurin was interrupted, dose-reduced or stopped in 55% of the pts. Overall 94 pts received an alloHSCT, 85 in first CR (n=65 age<60 yrs, n=20 age \u226560 yrs) and 9 pts after salvage outside the protocol or after relapse (n=70 from a matched unrelated and n=24 from a matched related donor). In pts receiving an alloHSCT within the protocol in median 2 chemotherapy cycles were applied before transplant (range 1-4) and the cumulative incidence of relapse and death at 12 months were 9.2% (SE 3.3%) and 19.5% (SE 4.8%). Maintenance therapy was started in 52 pts, 40 pts after alloHSCT and 12 pts after HIDAC. Only 4 adverse events 3\u00b0/4\u00b0 were attributed to midostaurin. First analyses revealed a low cumulative incidence of relapse irrespective of the FLT3 -ITD mutant to wildtype ratio (<0.5 versus \u22650.5) in patients proceeding to alloHSCT with 12% and 5% as well as for those after HIDAC consolidation with 28% and 29%, respectively. Conclusions: The addition of midostaurin to intensive induction therapy and as maintenance after alloHSCT or HIDAC is feasible and compared to historical data may be most effective in those patients with a high FLT3 -ITD mutant to wildtype ratio.
