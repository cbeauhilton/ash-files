    "abstract_text": "Background Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is the primary enzyme responsible for symmetric arginine dimethylation of multiple proteins that impact cell proliferation. Its substrates include proteins involved in mRNA splicing, signal transduction, gene transcription, and DNA repair. PRMT5 overexpression occurs in many cancers and correlates with poor prognosis. GSK3326595 is a potent, specific, and reversible inhibitor of PRMT5 that inhibits proliferation and induces cell death in a broad range of solid and hematologic tumor cell lines. It also exhibits potent anti-tumor activity in vivo in animal models, including in preclinical models of myeloid malignancies. One mechanism of action of GSK3326595 is via inhibition of cellular mRNA splicing and upregulation of tumor suppressor function. Mutations in splicing factors are frequent in myeloid malignancies (including approximately 40% of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS], and over 60% of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML]), and further inhibition of mRNA splicing via GSK3326595 may lead to a synthetic lethal phenotype specifically in splicing mutant disease. Study 208809 is the first trial of a PRMT5 inhibitor in participants with myeloid malignancies. Methods Study 208809 is a Phase I/II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of GSK3326595 monotherapy in participants with relapsed and refractory MDS, CMML, and hypoproliferative acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that has evolved from an antecedent MDS. Part 1 will identify a tolerated dose and establish preliminary evidence of efficacy in this population. At the end of Part 1, if pre-specified criteria are met, then the study will be expanded with three additional Parts that will be opened in parallel. Part 2A is a Phase II randomized comparison of monotherapy GSK3326595 versus investigator's choice of best available care in participants with relapsed and refractory MDS, CMML, and hypoproliferative AML. Part 2B is a single-arm investigation of safety and efficacy of GSK3326595 plus 5-azacitidine in participants with newly diagnosed high-risk MDS. Part 2C is a single-arm investigation of the safety and efficacy of monotherapy GSK3326595 in participants with relapsed or refractory AML whose tumors harbor mutations in components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery. All participants enrolled in this study have a diagnosis of MDS, CMML, or AML, with enrollment into each cohort as defined above. Participants are adults with adequate organ function as defined in the protocol. Prior allogeneic transplant is permitted. There are no required biomarkers for enrollment to Parts 1, 2A, and 2B, though central confirmation of pre-mRNA splicing factor mutations will be performed to stratify participants for overall analysis. Enrollment to Part 2C is limited to participants with splicing factor mutations. It is estimated that a maximum of 302 participants will be enrolled in the study, divided as follows: Approximately 41 participants in Part 1, approximately 192 participants in Part 2A, approximately 41 participants in Part 2B, and approximately 28 participants in Part 2C. In Part 1, the primary endpoint is clinical benefit rate, as defined as the percentage of participants achieving a complete remission, complete marrow remission, partial remission (PR), stable disease lasting at least 8 weeks, or hematologic improvement, as per standard criteria. In Part 2A, the primary endpoint is overall survival. In Part 2B and Part 2C, the primary endpoint is overall response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of participants achieving a PR or better. Samples are collected to evaluate symmetric dimethylated arginine (SDMA), the enzymatic product of PRMT5. This has been demonstrated to be a pharmacodynamic marker of PRMT5 inhibition in plasma and tumor tissue. In addition, participants will be stratified based on the presence or absence of spliceosome mutations and analyzed separately to evaluate the effect of these mutations on clinical activity. As of 1 August 2019, recruitment is ongoing across six centers in the United States and Canada; ten participants have been enrolled, all into Part 1.
