    "abstract_text": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-protein encoding RNAs that bind to the 3\u2032UTR\u2019s of target mRNAs and negatively regulate gene expression by facilitating mRNA degradation or translational inhibition. Aberrant miRNA expression is well-documented in both solid and hematopoietic malignancies, and a number of recent miRNA profiling studies have identified miRNAs associated with specific human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cytogenetic groups as well as miRNAs that may prognosticate clinical outcomes in AML patients. Unfortunately, these studies do not directly address the functional role of miRNAs in AML. In fact, there is no direct functional evidence that miRNAs are required for AML development or maintenance. Herein, we report on our recent efforts to elucidate the role of miRNAs in AML stem cells. miRNA expression profiling of AML stem cells and their normal counterparts, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and committed progenitors, reveals that miR-29a is highly expressed in human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and human AML relative to normal committed progenitors. Ectopic expression of miR-29a in mouse HSC/progenitors is sufficient to induce a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) that progresses to AML. During the MPD phase of the disease, miR-29a alters the composition of committed myeloid progenitors, significantly expedites cell cycle progression, and promotes proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors at the level of the multipotent progenitor (MPP). These changes are manifested pathologically by marked granulocytic and megakaryocytic hyperplasia with hepatosplenomegaly. Mice with miR-29a-induced MPD uniformly progress to an AML that contains a leukemia stem cell (LSC) population that can serially transplant disease with as few as 20 purified LSC. Gene expression analysis reveals multiple tumor suppressors and cell cycle regulators downregulated in miR-29a expressing cells compared to wild type. We have demonstrated that one of these genes, Hbp1, is a bona fide miR-29a target, but knockdown of Hbp1 in vivo does not recapitulate the miR-29a phenotype. These data indicate that additional genes are required for miR-29a\u2019s leukemogenic activity. In summary, our data demonstrate that miR-29a regulates early events in normal hematopoiesis and promotes myeloid differentiation and expansion. Moreover, they establish that misexpression of a single miRNA is sufficient to drive leukemogenesis, suggesting that therapeutic targeting of miRNAs may be an effective means of treating myeloid leukemias.",
