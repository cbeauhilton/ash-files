    "abstract_text": "Background: Nestin-expressing cells (NeC) have been characterized to consist of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche in the mouse bone marrow (BM). Decreases of BM NeC have been reported in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) in humans and in the mouse model of MPN. These lines of information further emphasize the importance of the NeC for the maintenance of normal hematopiesis. Nevertheless, NeC appear to be heterogenous; nestin is reported to be expressed in multiple types of BM stromal cells distinct from each other, with regard to the anatomical localization and the cell-surface antigen expression pattern. One type is reported to be localized adjacent to sinusoids and another type surrounding arterioles. A subset of endothelial cells also appears to be a candidate of NeC in the BM. It is thus critical to define the identities of distinct subsets of BM NeC. Furthermore, each subset of NeC needs to be studied in the human BM from normal subjects and those with BM diseases to understand pathophysiologic significance of NeC in patients. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a clonal disease characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and an increased risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia. In this disease, anormalities of BM microenvironment have been repeatedly reported; however, consensus in detail has not been reached. Purpose: To define the identities of distinct subsets of NeC in the BM from normal human subjects and to explore their abnormalities in MDS. Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded BM biopsy samples from lymphoma patients without BM involvement (designated normal) and from MDS patients were immunostained with antibodies against six markers: nestin, CD34, laminin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament heavy chain (NFH). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining were performed. The microscopic analysis of IHC-stained samples involved 10 randomly selected fields of view at 400\u00d7 magnification, where the numbers of NeC and CD34-positive spindle-shaped cells were counted for quantitative analysis, as well as the association of these two types of cells was evaluated. IF samples were analyzed by a confocal laser scanning microscope using 10 randomly selected fields of view at 63\u00d7 magnification. Then, nestin-, GFAP-, and NFH-stained areas were measured using the confocal LAS AF software for quantitative analysis. Results: NeC were found at multiple locations in distinct contexts in the normal human BM. A majority of NeC were present in association with the arterior/arteriolar structures. These artery/arteriole-associated NeC were distributed at each of the three layers; the intimal layer inside the laminine-stained basement membrane, the tunica media epressing \u03b1SMA, and the adventitial layer outside the \u03b1SMA-stained structure. The NeC located at the intimal layer expressed the highest level of nestin. The NeC were present in a close proximity with the CD34-expressing endothelial cells, although whether the endothelial cells co-expressed nestin and CD34 was unclear. The NeC at the other layers showed relatively lower levels of nestin expression. We identified NeC which did not associate with the vascular structures, albeit at a low frequency and with weak nestin staining in the normal human BM. In MDS BM, there was a significant increase in the NeC that were unassociated with the vascular structures. A portion of these increased NeC co-expressed GFAP. These cells potentially represented Schwann cells, because some of them surrounded the NFH-stained structure. Consistent with this, GFAP- and NFH-stained areas were increases in the MDS BM, together with the nestin-stained areas when measured by the confocal LAS AF software. Discussion: Multiple subsets of NeC were identified in the normal human BM as well as in the MDS BM. It is yet elusive whether each subset of NeC has a HSC niche function. In MDS BM, there was an increase in a distinct subset of NeC. The origin of these cells was elusive, but the Shwann cells normally present along with the arterial/arteriolar structures could be a candidate, because in the normal BM, a portion of GFAP-expressing cells along with the vascular structures expressed nestin. It should be elucidated whether the increased sympathetic nervous structure is involved in the pathophysiology of MDS. Disclosures Obara: Alexion Pharmaceuticals: Honoraria, Research Funding."
