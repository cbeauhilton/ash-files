    "abstract_text": "Background We describe here platelet response and remission observed with romiplostim treatment in patients with ITP. Methods Patients with an ITP diagnosis for less than 6 months who received first-line therapies only (ie, corticosteroids, IVIG, anti-D) received QW romiplostim for up to 12 months in the treatment period ( Fig 1 ). The primary objective was to describe the number of months with a platelet response during the 12-month treatment period; secondary objectives included incidence of ITP remission and splenectomy. The romiplostim dose was increased QW by 1 \u03bcg/kg from 1 \u03bcg/kg up to 10 \u03bcg/kg to reach a platelet count of \u226550x10 9 /L, adjusting to maintain a platelet count of 50-200x10 9 /L. Patients who maintained platelet counts \u226550x10 9 /L on romiplostim only entered a dose-tapering period in which the romiplostim dose was decreased by 1 \u03bcg/kg Q2W as long as platelet counts remained \u226550x10 9 /L. Starting when the dose tapered to 0 during either the 12-month treatment period or at the end of the dose-tapering period, patients were followed to determine whether they had ITP remission (24 weeks platelet counts \u226550x10 9 /L without any treatment for ITP, including romiplostim). At the end of 12 months, patients who 1) had platelet counts \u226420x10 9 /L for <4 consecutive weeks, 2) had platelet counts of 20-50x10 9 /L, and/or 3) were receiving treatment for ITP besides romiplostim had the option to enter a stabilization period (\u22648 weeks) while the investigator determined suitable post-study therapy. Patients with platelet counts \u226420x10 9 /L for \u22654 consecutive weeks on the highest romiplostim dose were discontinued from the study for non-response. Interim data up to March 2013 are reported here.

Past treatments included steroids (96%), IVIG (42%), and anti-D (1%). Prior to the study, platelet transfusions were received by 9% of patients. 30 patients (42%) completed treatment, 31 (44%) are continuing treatment, and 10 (14%) discontinued romiplostim (due to consent withdrawn n = 2, adverse event n = 3, requirement for alternative therapy n = 3, lost to follow-up n = 1, death n = 1). Patients had a median (Q1, Q3) of 51 (34, 52) weeks of treatment with a median (Q1, Q3) average QW dose of 2.1 (1, 3.8) \u03bcg/kg. 66 (93%) patients had a peak platelet count \u226550x10 9 /L. The median (Q1, Q3) time with a platelet response was 9 (6, 12) months; the median (95% CI) time to platelet response was 2.1 (1.1, 3.1) weeks; platelet counts are in Fig 2 . Of 38 evaluable patients (ie, known remission status), 11 (29%, 95% CI 15% to 46%) had ITP remission. One patient had a splenectomy and 6 had treatment failure (defined as platelet count \u226420x10 9 /L for 4 consecutive weeks at 10 \u03bcg/kg QW, requirement of alternative therapy, or death). Of the 71 patients receiving romiplostim, 9 patients had serious adverse events (2 treatment-related: 1 case each of gastritis and increased transaminases). There were also 3 adverse events leading to discontinuation of romiplostim (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukocytosis, and the aforementioned increased transaminases, these last 2 treatment-related). Other serious adverse events, also occurring in 1 patient each, included atrial fibrillation, dapsone syndrome, fecaloma, the aforementioned non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, pleuritic pain, and tendon rupture. There were no fatalities reported as adverse events; the death leading to discontinuation was due to cerebral hemorrhage which began before the patient received romiplostim. The most common adverse events were headache (17%), arthralgia (13%), and nasopharyngitis (10%). The most common hemorrhage adverse events were hematoma (7%), petechiae (7%), and epistaxis (7%). No bone marrow findings were reported.

To date, 29% of evaluable patients have shown remission (24 weeks of platelet counts \u226550x10 9 /L without any ITP treatment). There were no new safety signals. Updated data from this ongoing study will be presented in the future.
