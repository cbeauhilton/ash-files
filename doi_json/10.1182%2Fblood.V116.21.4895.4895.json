    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4895 Background: The treatment of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is characterized by high rates of toxicity and intracranial relapse despite initial response. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX), with or without cranial irradiation, has become the standard of care; combining this with other chemotherapeutic agents has improved complete remission rates but at the expense of increased treatment-related adverse events, particularly haematologic and neurologic toxicity. Cytarabine has been used in combination with etoposide (CYVE) as a salvage therapy for patients who have been refractory to or relapsed after HD-MTX-based regimens (Soussain C et al, J. Clin. Oncol . 2001; Soussain C et al, J. Clin. Oncol. 2008). In these studies, cytarabine was given as an infusion at a dose of 50mg/m 2 /d over 12 hours on days 1\u20135, and at a dose of 2g/m 2 /d over 3 hours on days 2\u20135 with etoposide at 200mg/m 2 /d on days 2\u20135. Both responders and non-responders were eligible to proceed to autologous stem cell transplant (autoSCT) using a conditioning regimen of thiotepa 250mg/m 2 /d on days -9 to -7, busulfan 10mg/kg total dose po or 8mg/kg total dose iv over days -6 to -4, and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/m 2 /d on days -3 to -2. Median OS was 58.6 months in patients able to undergo autoSCT, but with significant neurotoxicity that may have been related in part to prior therapies. Methods and Results: Given its excellent CNS penetration, CYVE may be an effective regimen in previously untreated patients, with lower risk of neurotoxicity. We have used CYVE as a first-line therapy for patients with PCNSL who are potentially eligible for subsequent autoSCT. Between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2009, 7 patients with a diagnosis of PCNSL were treated with first-line CYVE using the regimen described above. All were HIV negative, showed no disease outside of the CNS on bone marrow biopsy and staging CT or PET scan, and had biopsy-proven PCNSL with diffuse large B-cell histology. Median age was 55 (42-61) with 4 female and 3 male patients. Median International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group Prognostic Index score was 2 (0-2), although in actuality may have been higher, as 4 patients were not able to undergo lumbar puncture at diagnosis. ECOG status was < 2 in 3 patients, \u2265 2 in 3 patients, and not documented in 1 case. Patients received a median of 2 cycles of CYVE (1-3), with 2 receiving concurrent rituximab and the 1 patient with intra-ocular lymphoma receiving post-adjuvant orbital radiation. No cranial radiation was administered. Five patients achieved CR and proceeded to autoSCT. Two patients had a PR but later died of progressive disease at day +48 and day +117, respectively. In both cases, however, the patients were suspected of having disease long before they were treated with CYVE. The first had presented 3 years prior to the diagnosis with a solitary brain lesion that resolved with decadron monotherapy before pathologic documentation. The second had had a brain biopsy that failed to show malignant disease 4 months before the PCNSL diagnosis was confirmed and treatment initiated. Median OS and PFS for the group have not yet been reached with mean follow-up of 657 days. Among the 5 patients who achieved CR, all patients remain alive in CR with a mean follow-up of 841 days (320-1262 days), or 28 months. Toxicities included at least 1 episode of febrile neutropenia in all 7 patients, 2 possible but unconfirmed cases of pulmonary aspergillosis, 2 cases of drug-induced hepatitis (with ALT > 3x ULN), 1 case of toxic epidermal necrolysis secondary to imipenem use during an episode of febrile neutropenia, 1 small bowel obstruction requiring surgical intervention, and 1 case of late grade 2 neurotoxicity presenting 3 years after treatment. Conclusions: In this small cohort of patients, first-line CYVE has shown to be highly effective (ORR 100%, CR 71%) with minimal long-term toxicity compared to that which is seen using it as a salvage therapy. When followed by autoSCT, long-term survival with preserved quality of life may be possible. A prospective study would be necessary to confirm these initial results in practice.
