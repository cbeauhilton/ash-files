    "abstract_text": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are enzymes with a key role in the first step of protein synthesis by catalyzing the esterification of a specific cognate amino acid or its precursor to one of all its compatible cognate tRNAs to form an aminoacyl-tRNA. During evolution, eukaryotic aaRSs have acquired additional domains and motifs conferring non-canonical functions beyond translation, such as expressing multiple cytokine activities. Repurposing aaRSs often requires an activation step and the first reported example was for human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YRS), which is abundant in platelets and released from their \u03b1-granules upon thrombin or arachidonic acid stimulation. As shown by previous work, activated YRS (YRS ACT ) - created by natural proteolysis, alternative splicing, or rational mutagenesis - can express the activity of different cytokines. In the current study, we demonstrate that recombinant YRS ACT rendered active by the gain-of-function mutation Tyr341Ala exhibits a previously unrecognized role in megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis. When administered in vivo in C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice, recombinant YRS ACT caused platelet increase both under baseline conditions as well as in a model of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in which mice are made thrombocytopenic by injection of rat anti-mouse glycoprotein (GP) Ib monoclonal IgG. When WT mouse bone marrow (BM) cells were cultured ex vivo for 3 days, YRS ACT treatment increased the number of megakaryocytes by 3.0-fold, particularly of megakaryocytes with 16N ploidy. This effect was independent of thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling because YRS ACT could support the expansion of c-mpl -/- (TPO receptor knock-out) mouse megakaryocytes. YRS ACT had no effect on purified mouse CD41 + or Sca1 + hematopoietic progenitor cells, indicating that YRS-dependent stimulation likely required the contribution of other cells present in BM cultures. When mouse BM cells were stimulated with different doses of YRS ACT , the number of F4/80 + monocyte/macrophages as well as of megakaryocytes increased in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistic analysis revealed YRS ACT targets the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway signaling through MyD88 in monocyte/macrophages, thereby enhancing release of cytokines that influence megakaryocyte development. In vitro binding assay showed that YRS ACT is capable of binding to TLR2 and TLR4. The effect of YRS ACT was attenuated in the BM cells derived from TLR2 -/- mice and was abolished in MyD88 -/- mice. Among the cytokines with synthesis induced by YRS ACT , IL-6 plays a pivotal role in megakaryocyte development. Thus, we tested the effect of YRS ACT on megakaryocytes obtained by culturing BM cell derived from IL-6 -/- mice and found that no effect was apparent. The stimulatory effect of YRS ACT on megakaryocytopoiesis was confirmed with human CD41 + megakaryocyte progenitors differentiated from CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells derived from peripheral blood. In conclusion, we have documented a previously unrecognized activity of YRS ACT that results in enhanced megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production. These studies document a mechanistically distinct aaRS-directed hematological activity that highlights new potential approaches to stimulating platelet production for treating thrombocytopenia and for improving ex vivo preparation of platelet concentrates for transfusion.
