    "abstract_text": "Background: Previously, we demonstrated that host pre-treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) improves engraftment of umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34+ cells in a transplant murine model. Recent data suggest that erythropoietin (EPO) determines the fate of hematopoietic progenitor cells in favor of erythroid differentiation. Herein, we evaluated mechanisms underlying the favorable effect of HBO therapy on UCB CD34+ cell engraftment. We hypothesized that HBO modulates EPO which in turn enhances UCB CD34 homing to the marrow, thereby enhancing engraftment. Materials/methods: We examined EPO receptor (EPOR) expression on UCB CD34+ cells by flow cytometry and western blot. Transmigration assays were used to evaluate EPO effects on UCB CD34+ cell migration toward Stromal Cell-Derived Factor 1 (SDF-1; CXCL12) which has been shown to mediate CD34+ chemotaxis to the marrow. Using an NSG transplant murine model, we evaluated serum EPO levels by ELISA and early UCB bone marrow/spleen homing by flow cytometry. Bone marrow UCB cell differentiation was examined 1 and 2 weeks post-transplant using CFU-assay. Results: We found that on average 17.6 (4.9-38.7) % of CD34+ enriched UCB cells express EPOR. EPOR expression was confirmed by western blot. The percentage of EPOR positive cells was significantly higher in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) defined as Lin - CD34 + CD38 - CD45RA - CD90 + CD49f + (45.7+/-1.4) compared to hematopoietic progenitor cells defined as Lin - CD34 + CD38 + (25.1+/-0.7) and multipotent progenitors defined as Lin - CD34 + CD38 - CD45RA - CD90 - CD49f - (27.2+/-0.3). Also, exposure of UCB CD34+ cells to EPO during cell culture inhibited their migration toward SDF-1 (Figure-1). HBO treated mice demonstrated significantly lower serum EPO blood levels compared to control mice (727.4+/- 42.02 versus1576 +/- 80.90 pg/mL, p <0.0001) measured 3-hours post-transplant. A higher percentage of human CD34+ was seen in the bone marrow of HBO treated mice 3-hours post-transplant (6.8+/-1.0 versus 3.4+/-0.6), p=0.01). HBO treated mice demonstrated significantly lower numbers of BFU-E ( 26.7+/-8.7 versus 75.3+/-19.3, p =0.043) and increasing numbers of CFU-G/M (166.0+/-27.9 versus 74.8+/-32.6, p =0.05). Conclusions: EPOR is enriched in UCB HSC. HBO lowers host blood EPO and as a result improves UCB CD34+ cell early bone marrow homing and enhances myeloid differentiation. Figure 1.
