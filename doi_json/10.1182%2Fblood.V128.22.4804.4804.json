    "abstract_text": "Background : During pregnancy, vitamin B 12 (B 12 ) utilisation increases, with deficiency being associated with adverse outcomes (Murphy 2007, VanderJagt 2011). It remains unclear however at what level vitamin B 12 status becomes detrimental, and the correlation with fetal harm. Establishing B 12 status during pregnancy is complicated by physiological changes such as haemodilution due to expanded blood volume, altered renal function, alterations in the vitamin B 12 -binding proteins and transfer of materno-fetal B 12 yet laboratories typically rely on the total abundance of B 12 in serum (serum B 12 ) asthe sole laboratory status indicator, interpreting results against reference range cut offs derived from non-pregnant populations, including men. Serum B 12 assays measure the sum of holohaptocorrin and holotranscobalamin (holoTC). Other markers of B 12 status are also available and are increasingly being adopted: holoTC (active B 12 ) accounts 6-20% of bound B 12 , which is the only form of B 12 presented for cellular uptake and used to satisfy metabolic demand; methylmalonic acid (MMA) is a by-product of methylmalonyl-CoA metabolism, the concentration of which in serum correlates inversely with tissue B 12 utilisation. Methods: Over a 2 monthperiod in 2015 we used an extended panel of laboratory tests consisting of serum B 12 , holoTC, and MMA to determine B 12 status, and assess appropriateness of our assay reference ranges, in 100 pregnant women with normal renal function at the end of the first trimester. Laboratory Analysis Serum B 12 and holoTC were determined by an Abbott Architect analyzer. The serum B 12 assay has a reference range of 187 - 883 ng/L. The holoTC assay has \u00b210% cross-reactivity from B 12 -binding proteins haptocorrin and apotranscobalamin. Values >128 pmol/L are above the dynamic assay range. In our laboratory holoTC results 70 pmol/L as replete. Results 25-70 pmol/L are classified as indeterminate and a serum MMA assay subsequently performed (Sobczy\u0144ska-Malefora A et al 2014). We determined serum MMA using a Gerstel Multipurpose Sampler coupled to a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization with results >270 nmol/L considered indicative of suboptimal B 12 status (Harrington DJ 2016). Results: All three assays, figure 3, were performed for 92 women (insufficient sample available n=8).HoloTCand MMA results are shown in Table 1. The distribution ofholoTCand MMA concentrations are shown in Figure 1. One woman had a serum B 12 below the reference range with a corresponding indeterminate holoTC and normal MMA. This set of results suggests questionable abundance of B 12 that has not translated to functional deficiency. One woman had a holoTCconcentration <25pmol/L, however the corresponding serum B 12 and MMA were not indicative of sub optimal B 12 status. Fourteen women had aholoTC result above the dynamic assay range. Two women had an elevated MMA concentration with corresponding holoTCresults indicating questionable abundance of B 12 but serum B 12 within our reference limit. This triad of values indicates possible emerging suboptimal B 12 status that would have been overlooked if serum B 12 had been used in isolation. Discussion: B 12 requirement increases in pregnancy and diet alone is unlikely to meet requirements (Murphy et al 2007). Deficiency has a detrimental impact on maternal and infant development and therefore it is useful to explore the relationship between different laboratory markers of B 12 status in pregnancy (Ramirez-Velez et al 2016, Siddiqua et al 2014). The comparison of serum B 12 ,holoTC and MMA levels at the end of the first trimester with reference ranges derived from non-pregnant adults suggests that they are broadly applicable. Serum B 12 is the least sensitive marker and its use in isolation to assess B 12 status is limiting. The application of holoTC and MMA in tandem can reveal previously missed deficient states. Using these markers two women in this small study were identified as possibly deficient although the true significance of a mildly elevated MMA in pregnancy requires further investigation. These data highlight the benefit of adopting a panel of markers ahead of a single test to assess B 12 status. Identifying women at the end of the first trimester that may benefit from B 12 replacement potentially protects from deficient states.
