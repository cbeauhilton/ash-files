    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5235 Aberrant Ephrin signaling has been shown to be an important pathway that contributes to the pathogenesis of many solid tumors (Surawska et al. Cytokine & Growth factor reviews 2004). Deregulated ephrin receptor (Eph) and ligand (Efn) expression is often associated with poor prognosis in solid tumors. Ephrin receptor and ligand overexpression can result in tumorigenesis through induced tumor growth, tumor cell survival, angiogenesis and metastasis (Surawska et al. Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews 2004; Campbell et al. Curr. Isues Mol. Biol. 2008; Chen et al. Cancer Research 2008). In normal cells Eph receptors and ligands play key roles in vascular patterning, where they function in endothelial cell migration, and proliferation (Adams et al, Genes Dev. 1999; Zhang et al., Blood 2001). Thus far particularly EphB4 receptor and ephrin-B2 ligand have been implicated in the process of normal angiogenesis. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients it was found that bone marrow biopsies at diagnosis exhibited enhanced microvessel density (MVD) (de Bont ES et al., BJH 2001; Byrd JC et al., Blood 2002; Padro et al., Blood 2000). Normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) express the following mRNA transcripts ephrin receptors EphA1, EphA2, EphB2, and EphB4 and ephrin ligands EfnA3, EfnA4, and EfnB2. Moreover, overexpression of EphB4 receptor in HSCs (from cord blood) resulted in enhanced differentiation towards megakaryocytes (Wang et al. Blood 2002). In AML cell lines there is a common co-expression on protein level observed between EphB4 receptor and ephrin-B2 ligand. Recently, an aberrant DNA methylation of ephrin receptors and ligands was described in acute lymphocytic and myelocytic leukemia cell lines (Kuang et al. Blood 2010). In addition, restoration of EphB4 expression in an acute lymphoid leukemia cell line resulted in reduced proliferation and apoptotic cell death. These data suggests that the ephrin signaling pathway might play an important role in leukemia. In a previous study we have found high kinase activity of EphB receptors and high phosphorylation levels of EphB receptors in AML samples, as measured using kinase arrays and proteome profiler arrays. In this study, we have found extensive membrane expression of EphB1 on AML cell lines and primary AML blasts. To identify the role of Ephrin signaling in AML, two AML cell lines THP-1 and HL60 with an EphB1 membrane expressing cell percentage of 70% and 20% respectively were chosen for stimulation with Ephrin-B1 ligand. Treatment of these cell lines with Ephrin-B1 ligand resulted in a decreased proliferation 30% in THP-1 cells versus 22% in HL60 cells and increased apoptosis 23% in THP-1 cells and 4% in HL60 cells. Of note, the most prominent effect of Ephrin-B1 stimulation was found in THP-1 cells, this cell line contained a higher percentage of EphB1 membrane expressing cells. We further investigated the mechanism through which EphB1 reduces leukemic cell growth and induces leukemic cell death in THP-1 cells. Westernblot analysis of cell cycle regulators showed that expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 is reduced upon Ephrin-B1 ligand stimulation and the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX is induced. In addition, mRNA expression of the cell cycle inhibitor of cell cycle progression p21 was found to be 2,5 fold upregulated in ephrin-B1 ligand treated cells compared to untreated control cells. MGG stainings of Ephrin-B1 treated cells revealed multiple cells with two nuclei in both THP-1 and HL60 cells. These results indicate that a high percentage of AML cells express EphB1 receptor on the membrane and that stimulation of these cells with Ephrin-B1 ligand results in reduced leukemic growth and increased cell death. EphrinB1 activation in AML deserves further investigation considering EphB1 as a putative new treatment option for AML patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
