Few studies have identified the risk factors for candidemia in pediatric oncology patients. Methods We conducted a nested case-control study within a cohort of pediatric patients admitted to the oncology unit at a children's hospital between 2001 and 2004. A case was defined as a patient with a positive blood culture for Candida spp. As time at risk is an important confounding variable in nosocomial studies assessing antibiotic risk factors, we selected two controls per case based on incidence-density sampling. Demographic and clinical data were collected by medical record review. Assessment of exposures was focused on the 2 weeks prior to the development of infection (case)/study entry (control). Conditional multivariate analyses were performed to determine independent risk factors for candidemia. Results We identified 45 oncology patients with candidemia during the study period. The most commonly isolated species were C. albicans (49%), C. parapsilosis (18%), C. glabrata (9%), and C. lusitaniae (9%). The median age of cases was 6.2 years (Interquartile Range (IQR): 2.9\u2013 13.8 years). Median time to candidemia was 12 days (IQR: 4-22 days). There was no significant difference in mortality between cases (7%) and controls (7%). Independent risk factors for candidemia included receipt of aminoglycosides for >3 days (OR: 10.51, CI: 2.96, 64.43), receipt of total parenteral nutrition (OR: 13.82, CI: 2.48, 44.49), and Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) (OR: 15.09, CI: 0.91, 250.24).

These results may inform targeted interventions to reduce the risk of candidemia in pediatric oncology patients.
