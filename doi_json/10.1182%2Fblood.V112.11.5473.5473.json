    "abstract_text": "Endothelial dysfunction is considered to be a pre-clinical stage of atherosclerosis and represents an initial step of plaque progression. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the overproduction of biochemical markers is related to vascular damage. We studied 72 patients split into three groups: 20 patients had no vessels significant disease; 18 patients had multi-vessels disease; 34 patients had multi-vessels disease and stenosis >50%. Patients with known coronary artery disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes and/or dyslipidemia were excluded from the study. We measured plasma levels of vWF (a marker of endothelial stress), VEGF (a marker of neointimal proliferation), TF and E-selectin (a marker of endothelial activation), all were measured by ELISA, and we investigated if their increased levels are related to the endothelial damage (table 1).

Healthy endothelium exerts a favourable and athero-protective effects by a numbers of factors. Table 2. Favorable and Atheroprotective Effects of the Healthy Endothelium  Promotion of vasodilation .
