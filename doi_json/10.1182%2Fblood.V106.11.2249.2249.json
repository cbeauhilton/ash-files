    "abstract_text": "134 patients with a prior diagnosis of a malignant solid tumor presented between 1 Jan 95 and 31 Dec 04 to the leukemia service at PMH for management of a secondary hemopoietic malignancy or aplasia (AML n=99, MDS n=22, ALL n=11, AA n=2). The cohort included 65 males (median age 70 years, ranging from 18\u201394 years) and 69 females (median age 60 years, ranging from 25\u201387 years). The tumor types showed the expected gender based variation. Based on age, performance status and patient preference 81 individuals received remission induction therapy, while 53 patients were managed with supportive care. 49 of the patients undergoing induction therapy met the age criteria (70 years) for a blood and marrow transplant (BMT) and survived at least 70 days post initiation of induction therapy. 25 of the 49 patients underwent allogeneic BMT from related (n=20) or unrelated donors (n=5). The median survival of all 134 patients amounted to 314 days with an overall survival (OS) at 2 and 3 years of 25% and 20%. The respective values for patients undergoing induction therapy and supportive care were 413 days,36%,28% and 192 days, 9%,7% (p= 0.0002). Survival was strongly influenced by age (p= 0.0017), while gender (p=0.1436) and FAB subtype (p=0.219) did not contribute significantly to outcome. Subset analysis of the 25 BMT recipients showed a median survival of 922 days, with a 51% and 39.5 % OS at 2 and 3 years. The respective data for the remaining 24 not transplanted patients were not significantly different (p= 0.7508) with 522 days, 42% and 35%. Both subgroups however differed significantly in their causes of death favoring a lower relapse rate for transplant recipients and lower treatment related mortality (TRM) for non-transplanted patients (p=0.0012). In conclusion, this single center study confirms the relatively poor outcome for patients with secondary leukemias but is consistent with the view that patients able to undergo intensive therapy including transplantation may derive a significant survival benefit. The low relapse rate observed for BMT patients compared to patients not transplanted may translate into a survival benefit provided TRM can be reduced",
