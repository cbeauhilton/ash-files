    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2467 Integrins mediate bi-directional signaling between the extracellular ligand binding sites and the cytoplasmic tails, linking the cytoskeleton and intracellular processes to the cellular microenvironment. Interactions between the integrin cytoplasmic tail with accessory proteins can alter the integrins' ligand binding affinity, modulate cytoskeletal remodeling necessary for adhesion and motility and promote cell survival signaling. Prior studies have implicated involvement of \u03b14 integrins in cell adhesion mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) in cell models for multiple myeloma and AML. In the present study, we used a genetic reconstitution model to examine the requirement of \u03b14-extracellular ligand interaction in CAM-DR and to delineate the \u03b14 tail sequences mediating drug resistance. Methods: JB4 cells, a Jurkat T-cell derivative lacking \u03b14 expression, was reconstituted with wildtype \u03b14 (JB4-\u03b14) and a cytoplasmic tail truncated mutant (JB4-\u03b14\u0394). Cells were plated on CS1, Fn9.11 or BSA to specifically engage respectively, \u03b14\u03b21, \u03b15\u03b21, or no integrins. Adhered or non-adhered cells were untreated or treated with doxorubicin, and % apoptosis determined by flow cytometry using Annexin V binding. Results: The percentage of apoptotic Jurkat and JB4-\u03b14 cells plated on CS1 or Fn9.11 and subjected to doxorubicin were half of those plated on BSA, indicating that both \u03b14\u03b21 and \u03b15\u03b21 integrin ligation confer enhanced chemoresistance. In contrast, JB4 cells lacking \u03b14\u03b21 expression exhibited CAM-DR when plated on Fn9.11, but not on CS1 or BSA, indicating \u03b14\u03b21-ligation to its substrate is necessary to support \u03b14-mediated CAM-DR. Unexpectedly, JB4-\u03b14\u0394 cells exhibited chemoresistance to doxorubicin when plated on all 3 substrates suggesting \u03b14\u0394 expression resulted in an adhesion independent chemoresistant phenotype. \u03b14\u0394 is truncated at the C-terminal tail following the highly conserved KxGFFKR sequence which is required for \u03b1-\u03b2 heterodimer formation. This deletion is also known to disrupt \u03b14\u0394\u03b21 binding with its extracellular ligand; a phenomenon which we confirmed using adhesion assays. The adhesion independent chemoresistance exhibited by JB4-\u03b14\u0394 could be attributed to a gain in \u03b21 expression (as \u03b14\u0394\u03b21). To eliminate formation of the heterodimer, we created JB4-Tac and JB4-Tac\u0394 cells, where Tac\u0394 is a fusion of KxGFFKR to the extracellular and transmembrane epitope of the monomeric Tac. Treatment of JB4-Tac\u0394, but not JB4-Tac cells with doxorubicin in suspension recapitulated the low levels of apoptosis exhibited by JB4-\u03b14\u0394 cells, indicating that the membrane proximal KxGFFKR sequence is sufficient to promote an adhesion independent form of chemoresistance. The effects are mediated in part via stimulation of the PI3K/Akt/Bad cell survival pathway. Adhesion of \u03b14\u03b21-expressing cells to CS1, or of \u03b15\u03b21 to Fn9.11, stimulated an increase in phospho-Akt and phospho-Bad. Conversely, JB4-\u03b14\u0394 and JB4-Tac\u0394 cells exhibit constitutively high levels of phospho-Akt in an adhesion independent manner. We also show that the membrane proximal KxGFFKR associates with the Ca 2+ binding protein calreticulin (CRT) that is known to regulate L-type Ca 2+ channels. Finally, co-treatment of cells with doxorubicin and Verapamil, an L-type Ca 2+ channel inhibitor, enhanced the chemosensitivity of JB4-Tac\u0394 cells. Thus, the highly conserved membrane proximal KxGFFKR motif of \u03b1-integrins mediates chemoresistance via its interaction with a Ca 2+ binding protein involved in regulation of an L-type calcium channel. With the increasing number of integrin-ligand interactions shown to promote CAM-DR, we speculate that interactions involving the KxGFFKR motif of \u03b1-integrins may be the common denominator for effecting cell adhesion mediated survival signaling and drug resistance.
