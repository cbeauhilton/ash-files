    "abstract_text": "Lymphomas of the oral cavity consist 1 involved sites. Thirty six patients (pts) (78.3%) had clinical stage I or II and 10 (21.7%) advanced stage disease. A monoclonal lymphocytic population was detected in the blood of 7 pts (15.2%) by PCR (IgH or TCR rearrangement), 4 of them with early stage lymphoma. 56.5% of the lesions were diagnosed as B-DLCL and only 10.8% as peripheral T-cell lymphomas. Nineteen pts with B-DLCL received CHOP or equivalent chemotherapy regimens and 11 CHOP combined with anti-CD20. Chlorambucil was administered in 4 pts with MALT lymphoma and local radiotherapy as the sole treatment in 1. The pts with T-cell lymphoma received CHOP (3) or interferon alfa-2b (2). Thirty eight pts are in complete remission. There were 3 deaths due to the disease (1 MALT, 1 predominantly small cleaved cell and 1 B-DLCL). Three additional pts relapsed and achieved complete response with a second chemotherapy course and 2 pts developed a lymphoma of different histology. In conclusion, oral lymphoma is a rare disease mainly of a diffuse large B-cell histology and a prolonged survival, when treated with chemotherapy (10-year Event Free Survival 82.5%).",
