    "abstract_text": "Objective: The changes of methylation of CpG Island are the frequent changes in epigenetic. Nowadays, there are many methods to detect the changes of methylation, but all these method are hard to quantitate precisely. In our experiment, we will establish a new precise method. Methods: Use hydrosulfite to handle the DNA, and then do PCR. The cytosine will change to thymine, if it hasn\u2019t been methylation. On the other side, the cytosine will maintain its state if it has been methylation. Design a pair of probe, which contain one methylation probe and one un methylation probe. This pair of probe will detect three consecutive sites of CpG island in P16. Our experiment will use gene chip. Mix the the DNA of methylation and unmethylation with different ratio, then build the standard curve. Contrast the patient sample with standard curve will get the quantitate result. Results: We detected three patients, the methylation degree of the patients is 84.3%, 0%, 17.7%. Conclusion: The method we used can detect methylation degree of three consecutive sites of P16 quantitate precisely. Solve the problem of quantitate precisely.",
