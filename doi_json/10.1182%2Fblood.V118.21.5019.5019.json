    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5019 Background: MDS patients receiving chronic transfusions can develop significant iron accumulation in key organs such as the liver following 10\u201320 transfusions (Porter et al. BJH 2001). The diagnosis and monitoring of iron overload, as well as the effect of iron chelation therapy in MDS patients, is often based on serum ferritin (SF), with limited data on liver iron concentration (LIC), primarily due to the biopsy-related increased risk of bleeding and infections in these patients. However, LIC is clinically a more robust and direct measure of body iron burden and with the availability of non-invasive determination of LIC by MRI, LIC assessment has become more practical in MDS patients. This pooled analysis focuses on LIC assessments from a population of 71 MDS patients who completed 1 year of treatment with deferasirox (Exjade\u00ae), including assessment of the relationship between LIC vs SF and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Methods: Analysis is based on 1-year pooled data from iron-overloaded patients with MDS who were enrolled in 4 open-label single-arm deferasirox studies: US02 (Low/Int-1 MDS patients, starting dose 20 mg/kg/day); 2409 (MDS patients with life expectancy >1 yr, starting dose 10\u201330 mg/kg/day); 108 (MDS patients with life expectancy >1 yr, dosing 5\u201340 mg/kg/day), and 2204 (Low/Int-1 MDS patients, starting dose 10\u201330 mg/kg/day). LIC was assessed in the US02, 2409 and 2204 studies using R2 MRI (St Pierre et al . Blood 2004). In the 108 study, LIC was assessed by magnetic liver susceptometry using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) or ultrasound-guided percutaneous liver biopsy; LIC values obtained by SQUID were multiplied by a factor of 2 to correct for the underestimation of LIC by SQUID compared to biopsy (Porter et al. EJH 2008). Datasets were pooled for baseline (BL) characteristics, as well as LIC, SF and ALT at BL and end of study (EOS). Correlations were evaluated on a Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: 71 patients (56.3% male) were assessed with a mean age of 65 years (range 16.5\u201382.0). Mean transfusional iron intake \u00b1 SD was 0.31 \u00b1 0.12 mg/kg/day. Mean actual deferasirox dose was 19.6 \u00b1 6.5 mg/kg/day. At BL, mean \u00b1 SD LIC was 20.5 \u00b1 14.6 mg Fe/g dw (BL LIC 15 mg Fe/g dw, 54.9%). Median BL SF was 2620 ng/mL (range 538\u201312,639) (BL SF \u22642500 ng/mL, 47.9%; >2500\u2013\u22645000 ng/mL, 32.4%; and >5000 ng/mL, 15.5%). With 1 year of DFX, mean \u00b1 SD LIC decreased to 13.9 \u00b1 13.1 mg Fe/g dw (mean absolute change \u20136.6 mg Fe/g dw). In patients with BL LIC <7 mg Fe/g dw (n=15), LIC was maintained with a mean absolute change of 1.0 \u00b1 2.8 mg Fe/g dw, whereas in patients with BL LIC \u22657 mg Fe/g dw (n=56), LIC was reduced by \u20138.6 \u00b1 10.7 mg Fe/g dw from BL. The proportion of MDS patients with LIC \u22657 mg Fe/g dw reduced from 78.9% at BL to 59.2% at EOS, with 50.7% of patients achieving a decrease in LIC of \u226530%. Median SF decreased to 2035 ng/mL (range 158\u201310520 ng/mL) with median absolute change from baseline of \u2013630 ng/mL. There was a significant correlation between BL LIC and SF ( R =0.548; P <0.0001). Change in LIC significantly correlated with change in serum ferritin ( R =0.336; P =0.0042, Figure A ). Mean ALT decreased from 55.9 to 38.9 U/L (absolute change \u201317.0). The change in LIC correlated with the change in ALT ( R =0.397, P =0.0006, Figure B ).

One year of treatment with deferasirox produced relevant reductions in LIC, an outcome possibly indicative of a clinical benefit. SF and ALT (an important indicator of liver function) also decreased, with reductions correlating with those of LIC. These findings indicate that correction of moderate-to-severe iron overload in MDS patients is associated with a parallel improvement in liver function.
