    "abstract_text": "Background. Haploidentical family donors represent the ideal solution to offer to every patient with high risk leukemia the potential cure of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Extensive application of haploidentical transplantation (haplo-SCT) has been limited by high rate of late transplant related mortality (TRM) and relapse associated with the delayed immune reconstitution (IR) secondary to the procedures of profound T-cell depletion required for severe graft-vs-host-disease (GvHD) prevention. Methods. In a haplo-SCT phase I-II multicenter, open, non-randomized trial sponsored by MolMed SpA, we infused donor lymphocytes genetically engineered to express the suicide gene herpes simplex thymidine kinase (TK-DLI) to induce early IR, while selectively controlling GvHD. We enrolled 54 patients (pts) -median age 51- with high-risk hematologic malignancies. Thirty-two patients were in remission at transplantation. Results. After myeloablative conditioning regimen, 50 pts received a median 11\u00d710^6/ kg CD34+ and 1.1\u00d710^4/kg CD3+ after Clinimacs CD34+ selection. Median time to engraftment of neutrophils > 1.0 \u00d710^9/L and platelets > 50 \u00d710^9/L was 14 days. TK cells could always be prepared in the appropriate timeframe, and no drop out secondary to inadequate cell manipulation occurred. Twenty-eight pts received TK-DLI at a dose of CD3+ cells of 0.9\u201340 \u00d710^6/kg: 22 pts obtained prompt IR with CD3+>100/mcl at day +75 (median) from haplo-SCT and day +23 from TK-DLI. Eleven pts developed GvHD (10 acute GvHD grade I-IV and 1 chronic GvHD) that was always abrogated by the suicide gene induction; no progression from acute GvHD to chronic GvHD and no GvHD-related death or long-term complication occurred. No acute or chronic adverse event related to the gene transfer procedure was observed during extended follow-up. With a median follow-up of 178 days (range 2\u20131821), the 3-year TRM in intention to-treat (ITT) analysis was 40% with last mortality event at d+166. Significantly, the cumulative infectious mortality was 10% in TK-treated immune-reconstituted patients. Immune reconstitution obtained with TK-cells infusion correlated with rapid development of a wide T-cell repertoire and detection of high frequencies of T-cells specific for opportunistic pathogens. Initially, TK-cells represented the predominant T cell component in reconstituting patients and showed a effector memory phenotype, an oligoclonal repertoire and a persistent ganciclovir sensitivity. At later times, untransduced cells progressively expanded and became the prevalent circulating lymphocyte population. This reconstitution kinetic was observed only in patients with TK-cell engraftment, suggesting a critical homeostatic contribution of TK-cells early after transplant. One year after TK cells infusion the repertoire and distribution of T cell subsets completely normalized. In ITT, the median leukemia-free survival (LFS) for patients transplanted with advanced chemoresistant disease was at d+169, while patients in remission at the time of transplantation showed an overall survival in ITT of 51% at 1 year. Conclusions. This multicenter trial confirm the safety and potential benefit in improving survival of the gene transfer technology integrated with a standard therapeutic procedure such as allogeneic SCT. The conditional benefit for patients treated with TK cells was remarkable as indicated by a complete abrogation of late infectious mortality provided by the fast and effective immune reconstitution. In the future, this technology based on genetic engineering of activated donor lymphocytes with higher allo-reactive potentialwill potentially impact also the transplant outcome of patients with refractory disease."
