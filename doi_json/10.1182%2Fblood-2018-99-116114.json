    "abstract_text": "Background. Induction of remission in pts with AML is often associated with the life-threating complication and ICU admission. The long-term outcomes of these AML pts discharged from ICU are unknown. The aim was to estimate the long-term outcomes of de novo AML pts required ICU admission due to life-threating complications during induction of remission. Methods. All de novo AML pts, younger than 60 y.o, median age 34 (17-60 yo), from 2013 to 2016 were enrolled in the study. All pts were divided into 2 groups: pts who required ICU admission during induction chemotherapy due to life-threating complications and pts who didn't require ICU admission during induction chemotherapy. Overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DSF) were assessed by the Kaplan - Meier method, log rank value p<0.05 consider as significant. Univariate analysis was performed with \u03c7 2 tests or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables to find an independent ICU mortality predictor. Results In total, 73 AML pts included in study, 26 (36%) of them were admitted in ICU during induction of remission (tab. 1). ICU pts had more advanced AML. Reasons for ICU admissions were acute respiratory failure (ARF) (62%); neurological events (16%); septic shock (SS) (16%); cardiac arrhythmia (7%). ICU survival rate was 69%. 8 pts died in ICU (5 SS and 3 ARF). Needs for mechanical ventilation, vasopressors and \u22652 organ dysfunctions were independent predictors (p0.05). There were differences in 30-day OS between ICU and non-ICU pts (69% vs. 0%, p=0.001 ). However, a landmark analysis for long term OS for patients who survived the first 30 days of treatment were the similar in ICU and non-ICU groups ( p=0.946)( picture1, A) . DSF also were the similar in ICU and non-ICU groups ( p=0.946) (picture 1,B) Conclusion. During remission induction 36% of AML pts needed ICU admission due to life-threating complications. Mortality rate in ICU is high (31%). However, after discharging from ICU AML patents had the similar long-term outcomes as well as non-ICU AML pts. Figure. View large Download slide Figure.
