In acute myeloid leukemia and in non-Hodgkin lymphomas, V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells-based immunotherapy has shown encouraging results both in preclinical models and in early phase clinical trials. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) includes very heterogeneous clinico-biological entities, for which recent immunotherapy approaches are currently being developed. Nevertheless, global prognosis of ALL patients still be poor with a 5 years-overall survival of less than 40% and therefore, treatments need to be improved. Very few data are currently available on susceptibility of ALL blasts to V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell cytotoxic activity. V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells are activated by phosphoantigens bound to BTN3A1 on target cells. BTN3A molecules are targeted at clinical level, with the ICT01 agonist monoclonal antibody (mAb), that is currently tested in a multicentric phase \u00bd study (EVICTION study). Biology of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells has recently undergone a new paradigm with the identification of BTN2A1 as the direct ligand for V\u03b39 chain of \u03b3\u03b4 TCR. BTN2A1 is mandatory for V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell activation but its precise role in modulating functions of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells remains unknown. Here, we show that allogenic and autologous V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells exert cytolytic functions against ALL cell lines and primary ALL blasts, and we report that V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell cytotoxic activity is enhanced after treatment with a unique agonist mAb targeting BTN2A1. Material and methods 5 ALL cell lines (697, RS4;11, NALM-6, HPB-ALL, SUP-T1) and PBMC from 11 adults ALL patients at diagnosis (B-ALL, T-ALL and Ph+ ALL) were tested in functional assays. We evaluated apoptosis of ALL cell lines and of primary ALL blasts after coculture with allogenic V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells. ALL samples were also tested for their expansion capacities and a degranulation assay was performed at D14. We assessed in parallel relative quantification of the level expression of BTN2A1 (ICT0302 and 7.48 epitopes), and BTN3A (20.1 and 108.5 epitopes) on surface of ALL blasts. DAUDI-BTN2AKO+2A1 and HEK293-BTN2AKO+2A1 cells were used in binding assays, and modulation of TCR binding was assessed using recombinant tetramerized V\u03b39V\u03b42 TCR. Results We showed that V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells exert spontaneous cytotoxicity against ALL cell lines and primary ALL blasts with a heterogeneous susceptibility depending on the target. We demonstrated that anti-BTN2A1 ICT0302 agonist mAb significantly enhanced V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells mediated apoptosis in comparison to control condition, even for the less spontaneously susceptible cells. We confirmed these observations with degranulation of autologous V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells expanded from 5 ALL patients at diagnosis that was increased after treatment with anti-BTN2A1 ICT0302 agonist mAb. BTN3A and BTN2A1 were detected on surface of ALL blasts, and BTN3A 108.5 was the most expressed epitope. Interestingly, we observed that anti-BTN2A1 ICT0302 strongly increased binding of a recombinant V\u03b39V\u03b42 TCR to target cells using with HEK293 and DAUDI cells. Discussion Our results highlighted that V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells exert cytolytic functions against ALL cells, both in allogenic and autologous setting and demonstrated that BTN2A1 targeting with our unique agonist mAb could potentiate effector activities of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells against ALL blasts. These results indicate that the sensitization of leukemic cells can be induced by activation BTN3A as well as BTN2A1 mAbs. These data bring novel understanding on the biology of BTN2A1 on leukemic cells and our ability to enhance both binding and function. These findings could be of great interest for the design of innovative V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells-based immunotherapy strategies for treating ALL that could be extended to other cancer types.
