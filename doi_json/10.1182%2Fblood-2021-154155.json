    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients (pts) with relapsed-refractory (R-R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have dismal prognosis. Inotuzumab ozogamicin and blinatumomab monotherapy demonstrated high efficacy in the R-R setting. The combination of low-intensity chemotherapy with mini-hyper-CVD (mini-HCVD) and inotuzumab showed promising activity in R-R ALL. Adding sequential blinatumomab to this regimen might further improve outcomes. This analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin plus low-intensity chemotherapy with or without blinatumomab in R-R ALL. Methods: Eligible pts were diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell ALL. Odd cycles of mini-HCVD (cycles 1, 3, 5, 7) consisted of cyclophosphamide (150 mg/m 2 every 12 h on days 1-3), vincristine (2 mg flat dose on days 1 and 8), and dexamethasone (20 mg on days 1-4 and days 11-14) without anthracyclines. Even cycles (cycles 2, 4, 6, 8) consisted of cytarabine (0.5 g/m 2 given every 12 h on days 2 and 3) and methotrexate (250 mg/m 2 on day 1). During the first 4 courses, pts received rituximab when CD20 expression was \u226520%, and intrathecal chemotherapy. Initially, inotuzumab was administered on day 3 of the first 4 cycles at the dose of 1.3-1.8 mg/m 2 at cycle 1, followed by 1.0-1.3 mg/m 2 in subsequent cycles. Pts received maintenance therapy with POMP, consisting of 1 year of monthly prednisone 50 mg/d for 5 days and vincristine at 2 mg every month, along with 3 years of 6-mercaptopurine 50 mg twice daily and weekly oral methotrexate 10 mg/m 2 . An amendment to the protocol was made after the inclusion of 67 pts to add 4 cycles of blinatumomab after 4 cycles of the combination mini-HCVD + inotuzumab. Inotuzumab was given on days 2 and 8 at the dose of 0.6 and 0.3 mg/m 2 in cycle 1, respectively, followed by days 2 and 8 at the dose of 0.3 and 0.3 mg/m 2 in subsequent cycles; blinatumomab was continuously infused over 28 days every 42-day cycle for 4 cycles. Maintenance therapy was reduced to 12 cycles of POMP with 1 cycle of blinatumomab after each 3 cycles of POMP for a total of 4 cycles. The decision to undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) was based on the discretion of the treating physician after discussion with the patient. Results: Between February 2013 and April 2021, 108 pts were enrolled and treated, including 41 pts with mini-HCVD + inotuzumab + blinatumomab. The median follow-up is 34 months (range, 2-100). Pts characteristics and outcomes are summarized in Table 1. The median age was 37 years (range, 17-87). Seventy-seven pts (71%) were treated in salvage(S)1, and 31 (29%) in S2 and beyond. Twenty-one pts (19%) had received prior HCT. Eighty-nine pts responded, for an overall response rate (ORR) of 83% (CR, 62%, CRp/CRi, 21%). ORR was 93% in S1 (primary refractory, 100%; CR1 duration 12 months, 95%), 59% in S2, and 57% in S3 or higher. Among 87 responding pts who were evaluable for measurable residual disease (MRD), 71 pts (82%) achieved MRD negativity by multicolor flow cytometry, with higher rates of MRD negativity in S1 (86%). Forty-seven pts (44%) proceeded to HCT, overall. Three-year CR duration and overall survival (OS) rates were 48% and 37%, respectively (Figure 1). The 3-year OS rates for pts treated in S1 and S2+ were 46% and 16%, respectively ( P =0.001) (Figure 2). Pts who achieved MRD negativity had higher 3-year OS rate of 58% compared to 8% in pts who were MRD-positive at best response ( P =0.0003). The combination of mini-HCVD + inotuzumab +/- blinatumomab resulted in a significantly longer median OS compared to inotuzumab monotherapy (14 months vs 6 months; P <0.0001). In a landmark analysis among all responding pts, 3-year OS rates were similar between pts who underwent subsequent HCT and those who did not (51% vs 47%, respectively; P =0.85). Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) was observed in 10 of the 108 pts (9%), and its incidence was reduced from 13% with single dose of inotuzumab to 2% with fractionated dose schedule ( P =0.056). Among the 41 pts treated with mini-HCVD + inotuzumab + blinatumomab, 18 pts proceeded to HCT; of whom 1 patient developed VOD. Conclusion: With longer follow-up, promising outcomes continue to be observed with the combination of mini-HCVD + inotuzumab ozogamicin +/- blinatumomab in pts with R-R ALL. Using a fractionated inotuzumab schedule with sequential blinatumomab can help mitigate the risk of VOD. Outcomes appear similar whether or not subsequent HCT is performed.
