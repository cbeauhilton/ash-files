    "abstract_text": "Factor X a has a prominent role in amplifying both inflammation and coagulation cascades. In the coagulation cascade, its main role is catalyzing the proteolytic activation of prothrombin to thrombin. Efficient proteolysis is well known to require phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing membranes that are provided by platelets in vivo . PS, in the presence of Ca 2+ , triggers tight association of factor X a with its cofactor, factor V a . An interesting complication is that PS also triggers tight association of factor X a with factor X a , at least in solution (Majumder R, Wang JF, and Lentz BR. Biophys. J. 2003 , 84:1238\u20131251), to form an inactive factor X a dimer (Sen S, and Lentz BR, unpublished). In this work, we ask whether Ca 2+ and PS also trigger formation of an inactive factor X a dimer on a membrane and explore the possible physiological significance of this. We have determined the proteolytic activity of human factor X a towards human prethrombin2 as a substrate both at fixed membrane concentration (increasing factor X a concentration) and at fixed factor X a concentration (increasing membrane concentration). Neither of these experiments showed the expected behavior of an increase in activity as factor X a bound to membranes. The total factor X a activity actually decreased as low concentrations of PS-containing membranes were added, and increased at higher membrane concentrations. At fixed membrane concentrations, the total factor X a activity did not increase proportionally with factor X a concentration. Both observations suggested the existence of membrane-bound and inactive multimeric forms of factor X a . Because we have observed factor X a to form dimers in solution (Majumder R, Wang JF, and Lentz BR. Biophys. J. 2003 , 84:1238\u20131251), we tried to fit globally four such data sets to a model that takes into account dimerization of factor X a after binding to a membrane. This dimer model successfully described all our data, with the parameters of best fit being k cat /K M dimer = 0 M \u2212 1 s \u2212 1 , k cat /K M monomer = 430 M \u2212 1 s \u2212 1 , k cat /K M solution = 38 M \u2212 1 s \u2212 1 , and K d,surface dimer = 4 \u00b7 10 \u2212 12 mol/(dm) 2 . This surface dimerization constant corresponds to a solution-phase K d dimer = 10 nM at 100 \u03bc M lipid concentration, nearly what we observed for formation of bovine factor X a dimer in the presence of short-chain PS ( 20 nM ; Majumder R, Wang JF, and Lentz BR. Biophys. J. 2003 , 84:1238\u20131251). Also consistent with the dimer hypothesis, we observed that the binding of factor X a to PS-containing membranes appears to be tighter at low than at high membrane concentration. As we observed for soluble-PS-induced dimer formation in solution, dimer formation on a membrane was Ca 2+ dependent. Unlike in solution, factor X a was activated by membrane binding below 1.5 mM Ca 2+ , but inactivated above this Ca 2+ concentration. This suggests that factor X a activity may be regulated by Ca 2+ concentrations close to plasma Ca 2+ levels. We conclude that: factor X a dimerizes on PS-containing membranes; , factor X a dimer is inactive; and , the transition from monomer to dimer state depends critically on Ca 2+ concentration."
