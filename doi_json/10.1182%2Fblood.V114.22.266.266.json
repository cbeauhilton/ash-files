    "abstract_text": "Abstract 266 Background. Previous gene expression profiling studies on cHL have been performed on whole tissue sections (mainly reflecting the prominent reactive background in which the few HRS cells are embedded), or on cHL cell lines. However, cultured HRS cells do not likely reflect primary HRS cells in all aspects, being derived from end-stage patients and from sites (e.g. pleural effusions or bone marrow) which are not typically involved by cHL and where HRS cells lost their dependence on the inflammatory microenvironment of the lymph node. Methods. \u223c1000\u20132000 neoplastic cells were laser-microdissected from hematoxylin/eosin-stained frozen sections of lymph nodes taken at disease onset from patients with cHL (n=16) or with various B-cell lymphomas (n=35), including primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (nLPHL). After two rounds of in vitro linear amplification, mRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 chips. Expression profiles were likewise generated from sorted cHL cell lines and several normal mature B-cell populations. Results. Primary and cultured HRS cells, although sharing hallmark cHL signatures such as high NF-kB transcriptional activity and lost B-cell identity, showed considerable transcriptional divergence in chemokine/chemokine receptor activity, extracellular matrix remodeling and cell adhesion (all enriched in primary HRS cells), as well as in proliferation (enriched in cultured HRS cells). Unsupervised and supervised analyses indicated that microdissected HRS cells of cHL represent a transcriptionally unique lymphoma entity, overall closer to nLPHL than to PMBL but with differential behavior of the cHL histological subtypes, being HRS cells of the lymphocyte-rich and mixed-cellularity subtypes close to nLPHL cells while HRS cells of NS and LD exhibited greater similarity to PMBL cells. HRS cells downregulated a large number of genes involved in cell cycle checkpoints and in the maintenance of genomic integrity and chromosomal stability, while upregulating gene and gene signatures involved in various oncogenic signaling pathways and in cell phenotype reprogramming. Comparisons with normal B cells highlighted the lack of consistent transcriptional similarity of HRS cells to bulk germinal center (GC) B cells or plasma cells and, interestingly, a more pronounced resemblance to CD30+ GC B cells and CD30+ extrafollicular B cells, two previously uncharacterized subsets that are transcriptionally distinct from the other mature B-cell types. Conclusions. Gene expression profiling of primary HRS cells provided several new insights into the biology and pathogenesis of cHL, its relatedness to other lymphomas and normal B cells, and its enigmatic phenotype.
