    "abstract_text": "Malignant lymphoma of a T-cell phenotype (TCL) account for only 15% of lymphomas in Europe/North America and associated with a poorer prognosis compared with B-cell phenotype lymphomas. Whilst cumulative experience has shown that high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue (ASCT) is an effective salvage therapy in B-cell disease the role of ASCT and especially full intensity Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in T-cell disease, is limited. This study represents a collaborative retrospective case analysis of patients undergoing ASCT/HSCT for T-cell lymphoma. The aim of the study was to determine the impact of ASCT/HSCT on disease responsiveness, treatment-related toxicities and to examine influencing factors in relation to outcomes. All recipients of ASCT and HSCT performed in 1990 through 2002 for PTCL and reported to the British Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation (BSBMT) and the Australian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Registry (ABMTRR) were eligible for the study and data was examined retrospectively using a structured data retrieval proforma. Eighty-three patients received high dose therapy for TCL (ASCT n=65, HSCT n=18) with a median age of 28 years (12\u201352 yrs) in the HSCT group and 45 years (17\u201370 yrs) in the ASCT group, p0.01, respectively). These results suggest that ASCT has a significant role in the management of TCL, though full intensity HSCT is limited by both high NRM and limited evidence of graft-versus-lymphoma effect. Further exploration of reduced intensity HSCT may help to establish a role for HSCT in the management of TCL.",
