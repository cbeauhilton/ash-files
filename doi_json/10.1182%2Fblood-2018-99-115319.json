    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The optimal clinical setting and cell product characteristics for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in multiple myeloma (MM) are uncertain. In CLL patients treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cells (CART19), prevalence of an early memory (early-mem) T cell phenotype (CD27+ CD45RO- CD8+) at time of leukapheresis was predictive of clinical response independently of other patient- or disease-specific factors and was associated with enhanced capacity for in vitro T cell expansion and CD19-responsive activation (Fraietta et al. Nat Med 2018). T cell fitness is therefore a major determinant of response to CAR T cell therapy. In an accompanying abstract (Cohen et al.), we report that higher percentage of early-mem T cells and CD4/CD8 ratio within the leukapheresis product are associated with favorable clinical response to anti-BCMA CAR T cells (CART-BCMA) in relapsed/refractory MM. Here, we compare leukapheresis samples from MM patients obtained at completion of induction therapy (post-ind) with those obtained in relapsed/refractory (rel/ref) patients for frequency of early-mem T cells, CD4/CD8 ratio, and in vitro T cell expansion. Methods: Cryopreserved leukapheresis samples were analyzed for the percentage of early-mem T cells and CD4/CD8 ratio by flow cytometry and in vitro expansion kinetics during anti-CD3/anti-CD28 bead stimulation. Post-ind samples were obtained between 2007 and 2014 from previously reported MM trials in which ex-vivo-expanded autologous T cells were infused post-ASCT to facilitate immune reconstitution (NCT01245673, NCT01426828, NCT00046852); rel/ref samples were from MM patients treated in a phase-one study of CART-BCMA (NCT02546167). Results: The post-ind cohort includes 38 patients with median age 55y (range 41-68) and prior exposure to lenalidomide (22), bortezomib (21), dexamethasone (38), cyclophosphamide (8), vincristine (2), thalidomide (8), and doxorubicin (4); median time from first systemic therapy to leukapheresis was 152 days (range 53-1886) with a median of 1 prior line of therapy (range 1-4). The rel/ref cohort included 25 patients with median age 58y (range 44-75), median 7 prior lines of therapy (range 3-13), and previously exposed to lenalidomide (25), bortezomib (25), pomalidomide (23), carfilzomib/oprozomib (24), daratumumab (19), cyclophosphamide (25), autologous SCT (23), allogeneic SCT (1), and anti-PD1 (7). Median marrow plasma cell content at leukapheresis was lower in the post-ind cohort (12.5%, range 0-80, n=37) compared to the rel/ref cohort (65%, range 0-95%). Percentage of early-mem T cells was higher in the post-ind vs rel/ref cohort (median 43.9% vs 29.0%, p=0.001, left figure). Likewise, CD4/CD8 ratio was higher in the post-ind vs rel/ref cohort (median 2.6 vs 0.87, p2 lines of therapy prior to apheresis (n=3) compared to the rest of the cohort (n=35). Conclusion: In MM patients, frequency of the early-mem T cell phenotype, a functionally validated biomarker of fitness for CAR T cell manufacturing, was significantly higher in leukapheresis products obtained after induction therapy compared to the relapsed/refractory setting, as was CD4/CD8 ratio and magnitude of in vitro T cell expansion. This result suggests that CAR T cells for MM would yield better clinical responses at early points in the disease course, at periods of relatively low disease burden and before exposure to multiple lines of therapy.
