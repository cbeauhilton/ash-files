    "abstract_text": "Recurrent cytogenetic aberrations have been shown to constitute markers of diagnostic and prognostic value in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, even within well-defined cytogenetic AML subgroups with an inv(16) or a t(8;21) we see substantial biological and clinical heterogeneity which is not fully reflected by the current classification system. Therefore, we profiled gene expression in a large series of adult AML patients with core binding factor (CBF) leukemia [inv(16) n=55, t(8;21) n=38] using a whole genome DNA microarray platform in order to better characterize this disease on the molecular level. By unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on 8556 filtered genes we observed that our CBF leukemia samples separated primarily into three different subgroups. While two of the subgroups were characterized by inv(16) and t(8;21) cases, respectively, the third subgroup contained a mixture of both cytogenetic groups. There was no obvious correlation with known secondary aberrations or molecular marker like FLT3 -ITD, NRAS and KIT mutations between the cases in the mixed subgroup and the others. However, the newly defined inv(16)/t(8;21)-subgroup (n=35) was characterized by distinct clinical behavior with shorter overall survival times ( P =0.029; log rank test) compared to the other two groups. Unsupervised analyses within the inv(16) and t(8;21) cases also revealed corresponding inv(16) and t(8;21) subgroups with a strong trend towards inferior outcome ( P =0.11 and P =0.09, respectively; log rank test). Since the primary translocation/inversion events themselves are not sufficient for leukemogenesis, distinct patterns of gene expression found within each of these cytogenetic groups may suggest alternative cooperating mutations and deregulated pathways leading to transformation. Therefore, we performed a supervised analysis to determine the characteristic gene expression patterns underlying the cluster-defined subgroups. We identified 528 genes significantly differentially expressed between the newly defined inv(16)/t(8;21)-subgroup and the other CBF cases (significance analysis of microarrays, false discovery rate < 0.001). Potential candidates for cooperating pathways characterizing the mixed inv(16)/t(8;21)-subgroup included e.g. AVO3 , a member of the mTOR pathway, oncogene homologs like LYN and BRAF , as well as FOXO1A and IL6ST which have been previously identified to correlate with outcome in AML ( Bullinger et al., N Engl J Med  350 : 1605 , 2004 ). In conclusion, while the observed signatures remain to be validated for their functional relevance, both supervised and unsupervised methods provide numerous insights into the pathogenesis of CBF AML, identifying clinically significant patterns of gene expression, as well as candidate target genes involved in leukemogenesis.",
