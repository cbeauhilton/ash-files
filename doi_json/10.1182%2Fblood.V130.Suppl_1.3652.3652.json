    "abstract_text": "TGF-\u03b21 is a very potent cytokine that, when activated, exerts both physiological and pathological functions, but the mechanism of activation remains unclear. Platelets contain 40-100-fold more TGF-\u03b21 than other cell types and release TGF-\u03b21 in an inactive latent complex comprised of mature TGF-\u03b21 bound with latency-associated peptide and latent-TGF-\u03b21 binding protein 1. We previously demonstrated that shear force activates latent TGF-\u03b21 released from platelets in vitro, and that thiol-disulfide exchange contributes to this process. We also showed that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) regulates shear-mediated TGF-\u03b21 activation differentially, depending on whether PDI remains in its oxidized or reduced state. To test whether oxidation is required for latent TGF-\u03b21 activation, we subjected platelet releasates to physiological shear/stirring for 2 hours in a closed chamber with room air or argon gas. We found ~10-fold increase in TGF-\u03b21 activation compared to unsheared samples in room air, while the samples sheared under argon gas resulted in ~25% lower TGF-\u03b21 activation (21 \u00b1 1.0 % in room air vs. 16 \u00b1 2.0 % of total TGF-\u03b21 in argon gas, p=0.03). We also found that adding H 2 O 2 to the platelet releasate resulted in increased shear-dependent TGF-\u03b21 activation (active TGF-\u03b21 was 16 \u00b1 2.0 % in sheared samples and 22 \u00b1 2.2 % of total TGF-\u03b21 in sheared with H 2 O 2 samples, p=0.03), indicating that oxidation during shear contributes to TGF-\u03b21 activation. Since PDI can catalyze both oxidation and reduction of substrates, and because we previously showed that the reduced form of PDI inhibited shear-dependent TGF-\u03b21 activation, we hypothesized that blocking the reduction function of PDI may increase shear-dependent TGF-\u03b21 activation. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of quercetin-3-rutinoside (rutin), a specific PDI inhibitor identified by high throughput screening, on shear-induced TGF-\u03b21 activation. Rutin increased shear-induced TGF-\u03b21 activation in a dose-dependent manner in that > 2.0 fold higher TGF-\u03b21 activity was observed with 25 uM rutin, a concentration that blocked 55 to 80% of insulin reduction by PDI, confirming that rutin increases shear-dependent TGF-\u03b21 activation by blocking the reduction function of PDI. We then assessed how rutin blocks PDI reduction function using PyMol modeling to identify the most likely interactions between rutin and PDI domains. After adjusting for the possible rotations of likely bond orientations, and considering minimum steric forces, the best model identified strong pi-pi interactions between Trp396 of the b' domain of PDI with the quercetin moiety of rutin (Figure-1). This interaction may stabilize the active site sulfhydryls of PDI so they maintain an inactive conformation, which buries the active site sulfhydryls, causing a loss in their solvent accessibility and thus inhibiting PDI's reductase function and increasing TGF-\u03b21 activation. We conclude that thiol isomerases differentially regulate shear-dependent TGF-\u03b21 activation. Thus, thiol-disulfide exchange regulator, such as PDI may be a potential target for suppressing or enhancing TGF-\u03b21 activation.
