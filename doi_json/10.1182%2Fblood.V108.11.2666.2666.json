    "abstract_text": "Background: Cardiac iron overload is the first cause of mortality in thalassemia. In MDS, a causal relationship between cardiac iron overload and death is not as well established and heart complication may be of intricate origins in these elderly pts. Cardiac MRI T2* allows accurate measurement of heart iron and is influenced by iron content only (and not by other cardiac diseases). T2* value < 20ms is clearly associated with cardiac iron overload. A few reports (Winder et al ASH 2005, Chacko J BJH  2006 ; 133 : supp1 ) showed no cardiac iron overload by T2* in small numbers of multitransfused MDS. We performed a similar analysis in our transfused low risk MDS pts. Methods: We prospectively evaluated by MRI both cardiac T2* according to Anderson (Eur Heart J 2001) and liver iron content (LIC ) according to Gandon (Lancet 2004) and cardiac function by echocardiography in multitransfused low risk MDS pts. Cardiac MRI T2* was also assessed in 33 controls. Results: 21 MDS were analyzed, 9M/12F. Median age: 75 years ( 50\u201383); FAB : RA= 3, RAS=13, RAEB = 3, CMML n=1, unclassified n=1. Karyotype: fav n= 1, Int n= 18, failure n=1. IPSS: low n= 10, Int I n= 10, unavailable n=1. Median interval from MDS diagnosis and first transfusion was 40 and 24 months respectively. At inclusion, median number of RBC units transfused was 81 (range 6\u2013282, and greater than 100 in 8 pts). Median serum ferritin level was 2152 ng/ml and 11 patients were on chelation therapy (CT). 9/21 pts had cardiac symptoms and were on cardiac therapy. LVEF was below normal (55%) in 3/21 cases. Left ventricular telediastolic diameter LVTD was above normal (normal 53 mm) in 6/14 pts evaluated. Median LIC was 350 micromoles/g/dw (95\u2013898 ). Median Cardiac T2* was 27 ms (8\u201374) and did not differ significantly from controls (T2*=27ms+/\u22126.4). No correlation was found between cardiac T2* and ferritin, LIC, LVEF, time from MDS diagnosis. However 3/21 pts had cardiac iron overload with T2* < 20 (18ms,15ms,8ms respectively). LVEF and number of RBC units transfused of these pts was respectively 69%,51%,33% and 119,150,282 RBC units. Two of them were on iron CT, one of them since 8 years. The last 2 pts had clinical signs of cardiac failure unexplained by other causes and both had increased LVTD. Conclusions: Although cardiac T2* did not differ significantly in transfused MDS and in controls, 3 heavily transfused (all in the 8 patients who had received >100 RBC units) had clear cardiac iron overload, clinically relevant in 2 of them and not correlated with higher liver iron overload. Differences between our study and previous studies could be due to the higher number of transfused RBC units in our pts with abnormal T2*, as compared to a median of 50 in the study of Winder, but further studies are required to confirm this finding.",
