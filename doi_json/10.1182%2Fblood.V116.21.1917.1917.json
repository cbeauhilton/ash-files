    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1917 Background and Objective: Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by accumulation of monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow and progression of lytic bone lesions. The mechanisms of enhanced bone resorption in patients with myeloma are not fully defined. We have previously identified the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in proliferation and migration of MM cells. In the present study, we investigated whether BDNF was present in marrow from patients with MM and possibly involved in MM cell-induced osteolysis. Methods and Results: Levels of bone marrow plasma BDNF was measured by ELISA in a cohort of individuals with MM and controls. The concentration of BDNF was found to be significantly elevated in patients with MM (879 \u00b1 93) pg/ml when compared with bone marrow plasma derived from normal control subjects (186 \u00b1 52) pg/ml ( p < 0.001). Moreover, bone marrow plasma levels of BDNF positively correlated with plasma cell burden and extent of bone disease in MM patients. In osteoclast formation assay, bone marrow plasma from 31 of 37 patients with MM tested significantly stimulated the formation of osteoclast when compared to controls (61.8 \u00b1 7 [mean \u00b1 SEM for the 31 patients] versus 25.2 \u00b1 6 TRAP+ multinucleated cells/well [mean \u00b1 SEM for the 12 controls]; p < 0.01). The effect was significantly blocked by a neutralizing antibody to BDNF ( p < 0.05), suggesting a critical role for BDNF in osteoclast activation. Furthermore, BDNF was found to dose-dependently increased the formation of multinucleated, TRAP + osteoclast. The direct effects of recombinant BDNF on osteoclast formation and bone resorption support the potential role of BDNF in the MM bone disease. Using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis and western blotting assay, we demonstrated that BDNF receptor TrkB was expressed by human osteoclast precursors and a Trk inhibitor K252a markedly inhibited osteoclast formation stimulated with BDNF. These data suggested that TrkB is the functional receptor mediating BDNF's effect on osteoclast formation. Finally, bone marrow plasma BDNF level positively correlated with macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1 ( r = 0.45, p < 0.005) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) ( r = 0.68, p < 0.0001), two major osteoclast stimulatory factors in MM. Conclusion: Taken together, our results demonstrate the ability of MM cells to secret BDNF correlates with the severity of osteoclastic bone resorption, and provide evidence that BDNF play a causal role in the development of MM bone lesions through TrkB receptor.
