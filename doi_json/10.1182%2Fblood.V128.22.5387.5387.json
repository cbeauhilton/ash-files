    "abstract_text": "Background and objective. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is a major issue in the treatment of elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The use of non pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Myocet \u00ae )has been associated with less cardiotoxicity as compared to conventional doxorubicin in breast cancer, but its benefit in DLBCL has been investigated mostly in retrospective and single-arm prospective studies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the benefit, in terms of cardiac toxicity, of the substitution of conventional doxorubicin as part of R-CHOP therapy by the non pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Myocet \u00ae , R-COMP arm) in older patients (\u226560 years) with de novo DLBCL or grade 3b follicular lymphoma (FL). Methods. This is a prospective randomized phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02012088) of newly diagnosed patients with DLBCL or grade 3b FL \u226560 years old with baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 55%. Patients were randomized to R-COMP or R-CHOP (in both cases every 21 days for a total of 6 cycles, with a dose of conventional doxorubicin or Myocet \u00ae of 50 mg/m 2 /cycle). The primary end-point was to evaluate the differences in subclinical cardiotoxicity between the two arms of treatment, defined by a decrease in LVEF to \u2264 55% at the end of treatment (measured by echocardiography at 1 and 4 months after the last cycle of chemotherapy). Secondary objectives were efficacy, safety and differences in the variations of cardiac biomarkers (troponin and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]) through therapy in both arms of treatment. Results. Patient characteristics. A total of 91 patients from 15 Spanish hospitals were included, with a median age of 75 years (range 60-86), 49 (54%) were females. ECOG performance status was 2 in 15 (16%), stage III-IV in 68 (76%) and IPI 3-5 in 56 (63%). A total of 46 patients received R-COMP while 45 were treated with R-CHOP, without significant differences between arms regarding baseline characteristics. Subclinical cardio-toxicity: No differences between arms were observed in the number of patients with LVEF \u226455% determined at the end of treatment or at 4 months (6 [15%] in those treated with R-COMP and 5 [14%] in the R-CHOP arm, p=0.966). However, a higher number of patients in R-CHOP arm increased troponin levels at cycle 6 of treatment (17 out of 24 evaluable patients [71%] in R-COMP group vs. 25 out of 25 evaluable patients [100%] in R-CHOP group, p=0.004) or at the end-of-treatment visit (13 out of 21 evaluable patients [62%] in R-COMP group vs. 20 out of 23 evaluable patients [87%] in R-CHOP group, p=0.05). No differences between both groups were observed in variations of NT-proBNP levels through treatment period and follow-up. Serious adverse events (SAEs): With a median follow-up of 16 months (range 0.7-34), a total of 59 SAEs were reported in 37 patients (39 in 21 patients from R-COMP group and 20 in 16 patients from R-CHOP group), including 18 infections (12 in R-COMP and 6 in R-CHOP), and 14 episodes of febrile neutropenia (9 in R-COMP and 5 in R-CHOP). Four patients showed cardiovascular events: atrial fibrillation (n=1, R-COMP group), supraventricular tachycardia (n=2, R-CHOP group), and myocardial infarction (n=1, R-CHOP group). Efficacy: Overall response (OR) and complete remission (CR) were observed in 72 (96%) and 54 (72%) patients, respectively, without differences between R-COMP group (OR and CR rates of 97% and 72%) and R-CHOP group (OR and CR rates of 94% and 72%) (p=0.775). Conclusions. R-COMP is a feasible immunochemotherapy schedule for patients with de novo DLBCL older than 60 years. However, in our series, the use of non-pegylated doxorubicin instead of conventional doxorubicin was not associated with less decrease in LVEF measured by echocardiography, although the differences in troponin levels merits the need for further evaluation with a higher number of evaluable patients and longer follow-up.
