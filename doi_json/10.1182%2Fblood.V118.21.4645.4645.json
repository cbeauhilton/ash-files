    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4645 Acute leukemias collectively comprise the most common group of malignancies in the pediatric age group. Increasingly, therapeutic approach and prognosis are influenced by leukemia-specific cytogenetic abnormalities and genetic alterations, thus highlighting the importance of identifying novel prognostic markers. The Wilms\u2019 tumor suppressor gene WT1 is expressed in leukemic blasts and is found to be mutated in approximately 10 percent of leukemia cases. Although it is unclear whether WT1 acts as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene in leukemia, it is known to regulate genes involved in cancer progression, including the angiogenic and mitogenic factor, VEGF. Previous studies in kidney and prostate cell lines identified potential WT1 binding sites on the VEGF-A gene promoter and demonstrated that WT1 transcriptionally regulated VEGF expression. Thus, we hypothesized that WT1 transcriptionally regulates VEGF expression in leukemia. To examine WT1 and VEGF expression patterns in pediatric Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and non-neoplastic bone marrow samples, we performed quantitative real time PCR. It was observed that WT1 and VEGF expression varied depending upon the type and sub-type of leukemia. Furthermore, to understand the significance of WT1 expression, we over-expressed GFP- WT1 in Molt-4 cells (T-ALL), HL-60 (AML) and K562 cells (CML) and then quantified mRNA levels of VEGF and the potential WT1 target genes CCNA1 and JAG. The results showed that WT1 levels induced variable expression of VEGF, CCNA1 and JAG in these different leukemic cell lines. Elevated expression of WT1 genes harboring mutations of the zinc finger (ZF) DNA binding domain has also been described in a subset of leukemias and has been associated with a poor prognosis. We therefore screened pediatric acute leukemia samples for novel ZF mutations that would abrogate its ability to regulate VEGF and other target genes. Conversely, a well described SNP rs16754 (in exon 7 of the WT1 gene) identified as a good prognostic marker in Cytogenetically Normal AML (CN-AML) was observed in our pediatric population as both homozygous and heterozygous variants of the WT1 gene. Our long term goal is to determine the molecular basis of the prognostic impact associated with variant WT1 expression in pediatric and adult leukemias.
