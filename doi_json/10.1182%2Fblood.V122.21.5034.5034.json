    "abstract_text": "Introduction Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) widely affects elderly patients, with disappointing survival rates with increasing age. Although chronological age is an independent prognostic risk, it is really important to understand that this group is heterogeneous, so a geriatric assessment may be helpful before making decisions regarding therapy. We describe a 91 year-old patient with AML treated with decitabine, achieving a complete response and good quality of life for 10 months. Case Report In May 2012, a 91 year-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome was admitted at the emergency department presenting asthenia, pallor, pain and edema of the left inferior limb. Her blood count showed: hemoglobin 10.7g/dL, leukocytes 81.800/mm\u00b3 with 95% blast cells, and platelets 45.000/mm\u00b3. In addition, a Doppler ultrasound evidenced deep venous thrombosis in her left leg. A bone marrow aspirate confirmed AML with myelodysplasia-related alterations, with 95% blast cells, with\u00a0positive expression of CD45, CD33, MPO, and CD117 (CD45+; CD33+; MPO+; CD117+). Her karyotype was 46,XX [20 cells analyzed]. She was first treated with hydroxyurea. Afterwards, as her performance status improved and in spite of her age, we decided to treat her with Decitabine 20mg/m\u00b2/day for 5 days, because she had no severe comorbidity or any severe impairment of every-day-life instrumental activities. After a first cycle with grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, she was discharged. After 40 days, complete hematologic recovery was observed. She received seven treatment cycles, and the most important symptom of toxicity was febrile grade 3 neutropenia in the 3rd cycle, with the only inpatient treatment. After this intercurrence, the doses were reduced by 25%.\u00a0The patient achieved complete remission, spent eleven months without needing blood transfusions and with an acceptable quality of life, but then she relapsed, presenting persistent neutropenia and 44% of blasts in a bone marrow aspirate (05/27/2013). She died on 07/02/2013 due to the progression of the disease. Conclusion This case shows that, despite her advanced chronological age, our patient, affected by a fatal disease, lived approximately 13 months with optimal response to treatment (with Decitabine) and enjoying an acceptable quality of life for ten months. Considering this patient profile, could we conclude that this outcome is the best our treatment can aim to achieve? Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
