    "abstract_text": "T is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor with clinical activity in elderly adults with newly diagnosed AML who are not candidates for TCC. For adults age \u2265 65 with poor-risk AML, T 600 mg BID for 21 out of 28\u201363 days induced complete remissions (CR) in 14%, median duration 7.3 mos, median survival 18.3 mos ( Lancet JE, et al, Blood  109 : 1387 \u20131394, 2007 ). In vitro , T+E exhibits synergistic anti-AML activity. In an attempt to increase CR rates in elderly AML pts, we conducted a Phase I trial of oral T+E, with escalation of both drugs and 14 vs. 21 days of T every 28\u201363 days (median 31 days, range 29\u201350). T+E resulted in a 25% CR rate (21/84 pts), duration 2 \u2013 26+ mos, with best rates achieved with T dose \u2265 400 mg BID for 14 days ( Karp JE, et al, Blood  108 : 130a , 2006 ). In the context of this trial, we have conducted longitudinal laboratory studies of changes in DNA damage and apoptosis in AML marrow blasts obtained from 84 patients prior to T+E (Day 0) and on Day 8 of T+E. Blasts were enriched by Ficoll density gradient separation and fixed in 70% ethanol. Persistent, unrepaired DNA damage was quantified by flow cytometry of cells stained with antibody to phosphorylated histone H2AX (\u03b3H2AX). Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained cells with sub2n DNA content as observed in cell cycle distribution. To date, we have analyzed changes in in vivo \u03b3H2AX from 10 pts (4 CR, 6 stable disease or no response, SD/NR). CR pts had a 2-fold increase (range 1.91\u20132.22) in DNA damage induced by Day 8 of T+E relative to Day 0 values, while patients with SD/NR had no such increase (0\u20131.06) in DNA damage. Similarly, the apoptotic fraction of the cell cycle distributions of CR patients increase by 2-fold (range 1.2\u20135.3) for Day 8 marrow blasts. In contrast, changes in apoptosis were widely divergent for SD/NR patients (range 0.2\u20137.0). Taken together, these preliminary studies on AML marrow blasts obtained prior to and during T+E therapy suggest a possible linkage among induction of DNA damage, apoptotic response, and clinical outcome. Full analysis of all acquired specimens is ongoing.",
