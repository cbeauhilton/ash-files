    "abstract_text": "Manipulating gene regulation to favor gamma-globin transcription over beta-globin transcription has been a goal of research in erythropoiesis for decades because of its relevance to amelioration of the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. A fundamental unanswered question in biology is how the unique pattern of gene expression, the transcriptome, of the many different individual mammalian cell types arises from the same genome blueprint and changes during development and differentiation. There is a growing appreciation that genome organization and the folding of chromosomes is a key determinant of gene transcription. Within this framework, enhancers function to increase the transcription of target genes over long linear distances. To accomplish this, enhancers engage in close physical contact with target promoters through chromosome folding, or looping. These long range interactions are orchestrated by cell type specific proteins and protein complexes that bind to enhancers and promoters and stabilize their interaction with each other. We have been studying LDB1, a member of an erythroid protein complex containing GATA1, TAL1 and LMO2. The LDB1complex activates erythroid genes through occupancy of virtually all erythroid enhancers. LDB1engages in homo- and heterotypic interactions with proteins occupying the promoters of erythroid genes to bring them into proximity with their enhancers. We find that enhancer long range looping activity can be redirected. Both targeting of the beta-globin locus control region to the gamma-globin gene in adult erythroid cells by the tethering of LDB1 or epigenetic unmasking of a silenced gamma-globin gene lead to increased locus control region (LCR)/gamma-globin contact frequency and reduced LCR/beta-globin contact. The outcome of these manipulations is robust, pan-cellular gamma-globin transcription activation with a concomitant reduction in beta-globin transcription. These examples suggest that chromosome looping can be considered a therapeutic target for gene activation or gene silencing to ameliorate genetic diseases such as sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.
