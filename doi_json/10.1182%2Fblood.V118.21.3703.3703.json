    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3703 Background: Currently, there are accumulating data on the role of radioimmunotherapy in autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) with promising results. We compared the efficacy and safety of yttrium-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan ( 90 Y-ibritumomab) combined with intravenous busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide (BuCyE) with those of BuCyE alone followed by ASCT in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Patients and Methods: From October 2005 to May 2011, 71 NHL patients underwent high-dose chemotherapy with BuCyE (n=52) or 90 Y-ibritumomab plus BuCyE (n=19) followed by ASCT at the Asan Medical Center. Of 52 patients receiving BuCyE, we found 19 patients who had B-cell NHL and they comprised control group of BuCyE alone (n=19). Retrospective comparison matched by the same IPI was performed for the efficacy and safety between two groups. Results: The patient cohort consisted of 38 individuals (19 males), of median age 52 years (range, 27\u201365 years). The baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two groups. The median time to platelet engraftment (>20,000/mm 3 ) and the median time to neutrophil engraftment (>500/mm 3 ) did not differ between 90 Y-ibritumomab plus BuCyE (12 days [range, 3\u2013103 days] and 10 days [range, 8\u201312 days], respectively) and BuCyE alone (12 days [range, 8\u201335 days] and 10 days [range, 9\u201312 days], respectively). The objective overall response rate was 89.5% (17/19): continued CR, 42.1% (8/19); induced CR, 36.8% (7/19); PR, 10.5% (2/19) in 90 Y-ibritumomab plus BuCyE group, and 78.9% (15/19): continued CR, 26.3% (5/19); induced CR, 47.4% (9/19); PR, 5.3% (1/19) in BuCyE group, respectively ( p =0.649). Median follow-up duration for survivors was 30 months. Event-free survival tended to be better in 90 Y-ibritumomab plus BuCyE group with a median event-free survival duration of 12.5 months in 90 Y-ibritumomab plus BuCyE group and 6.2 months in BuCyE group ( p =0.236) ( figure 1 -a).There seemed to be no significant difference in overall survival between the two groups ( p =0.767, figure 1 -b). The toxicities including the incidence of grade 3 or higher stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hyperbilirubinemia were similar in the two groups. Figure 1.
