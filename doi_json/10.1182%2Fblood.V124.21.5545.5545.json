    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Satisfactory response is present for the majority of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients (pts) in chronic phase (CP) treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ITK) . However, some pts exhibit suboptimal response or treatment failure. The probability of achieving optimal response may be related with several factors. The oxidative stress modulation is tightly related with the physiopathology of various hematologic diseases and can cause cell death, apoptosis and necrosis. Peroxiredoxins (Prdx) are a family of multifunctional antioxidant thioredoxin-dependent peroxidases that protect cells against oxidative stress and modulate signaling cell proliferation pathways and may influence the metabolism of ITKs.The aim of this study was to analyze PRDX1, PRDX2 and PRDX6 levels of CML pts and correlate with cytogenetics and molecular responses. Methods: PRDX1, PRDX2 and PRDX6 expression was evaluated in 20 blood donors, 18 newly diagnosed CML pts and 22 previously treated pts. Pts were treated with imatinib 400-600mg in first line. Samples were collected from peripheral blood at diagnosis or during treatment and RNA samples were submitted to the synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA) using the kit RevertAid\u2122 HMinus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Life Sciences). For cDNA synthesis, 3 ug of RNA was used and peroxiredoxins expression was evaluated by real-time PCR with Syber Green (Applied Biosystems) and endogenous (\u03b2-Actina and GAPDH) controls. The results were analyzed using 2 - \u0394\u0394 CT . Statistical analysis were made by using Mann Withney\u2019s T test. Cytogenetic analysis was performed at diagnosis, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after starting therapy and then every 12-24 months thereafter if CCR was achieved. BCR-ABL transcripts were measured in peripheral blood at 3-month intervals using quantitative RQ-PCR. Results were expressed as BCR-ABL/ABL ratio, with conversion to the international scale (IS). Major molecular response (MMR) was defined as a transcript level \u2264 0.1% (IS). Results: 40 CML pts, 55% male, median age of 53 years (23-84) were evaluated, 60% in chronic phase (CP), 30% in accelerated phase (AP) and 10% in blast crisis (BC). The mean of PRDX transcript levels in the total group was (PRDX1: 0.006 and 10.10 / PRDX2: 0.002 and 16.26 / PRDX6: 0.003 and 49.97) respectively (PRDX1: 1.2 / PRDX2: 0.9 / PRDX6: 15.36). The results showed that there are a significantly difference (p<0.05) in the PRDX gene expression between pts and blood donors. All PRDX expression was reduced in responsive patients, and increase expression in pts resistant to TKI. The median duration of imatinib treatment was 29 months (1-104) and 97% achieved complete hematological response, 75% complete cytogenetic response and 65% major or complete molecular response. The analysis showed that higher levels of PRDX were maybe correlated with a no reduction of BCR-ABL transcripts (p<0.05). As well as, there was may influence of the PRDX levels at diagnosis in the response at 24 months of treatment. Conclusion: Is known that that the increase of ROS in CML leads to an increase of DNA damage, triggering genomic instability and resulting in accumulation of mutations and chromosomal aberrations, and contribute to the mechanism of acquisition of resistance to TKI inhibitors. The decrease of Peroxiredoxins expression observed in the responsive group, could contribute to this process, since the detoxification of these species are compromising and the effects caused by oxidative stress are even more drastic, leading to mutations that could be followed by TKi resistance. The relation between Prdx and CML not yet been elucidated. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
