    "abstract_text": "Background: The mechanisms of intestinal absorption of non-heme and heme iron have been extensively studied. However ferritin, which has been shown to be a good source of bioavailable iron in the diet, could have a different mechanism. Methods: Here we examined cellular mechanisms by which recombinant soybean ferritin (rSBFn) is absorbed in a cell model for intestinal epithelia. The internalization of mineralized (480 Fe) rSBFn, labeled with radioactive iodine, or the fluorescent probe Oregon Green\u00ae, was monitored in cultured, polarized Caco-2 cells. Additionally, internalization of rSBFn iron into the labile iron pool was determined by calcein fluorescence quenching. Results: Caco-2 cells internalized 131 I-rSBFn from the apical border in a temperature, concentration and time dependent fashion. The apical membrane showed saturable binding sites with a K D = 3.43 \u00d710 \u22129 M. After internalization, rSBFn was degraded, increasing iron in the cytosolic, labile pool, analyzed as calcein quenching. Horse spleen ferritin also induced calcein quenching. The amount of iron incorporated from 5 nM rSBFn was similar to that contributed by micromolar amounts of heme and non-heme iron. rSBFn endocytosis was inhibited by treatment with short RNAi for the \u03bc 2 sub-unit of the assembly peptide 2 complex, by cytosol acidification and by hyperosmolarity, which all inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Filipin II, an inhibitor of caveolar endocytosis, had no effect. Conclusion: These results suggests the presence of a third route of intestinal iron absorption in which ferritin from plant or animal sources is internalized from the apical medium of enterocytes by a clathrin-dependent endocytic process.",
