    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3580 The expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in CLL cells is an established mRNA surrogate marker for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgVH) mutational status. High expression of LPL correlates with poor prognosis. However, the possible functional role of LPL in CLL is still unclear. LPL is normally expressed in muscle cells, adipose tissue and macrophages, transported to the luminal surface of endothelial cells where it is bound heparan sulfate-proteoglycans (HSPG). Heparin competes with HSPG for the binding sites and intravenous injection leads to elevated plasma LPL protein levels and enzymatic activity (\u201cheparin release test\u201d). LPL mRNA levels correlate with intracellular protein expression (Heintel et al. Leukemia. 2005; Mansouri et al. Leuk Res. 2010). Moreover cellular lysates from CLL patients contain elevated LPL enzymatic activity compared to healthy donors (Pallasch et al. Leukemia. 2008.). In this study, we investigated the basal (pre-heparin) LPL protein levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the serum of 42 CLL patients, 14 non-CLL patients (lymphoma in remission), and 4 healthy donors (HD): Median pre-heparin LPL protein levels were 40.10 ng/ml (range: 5.66\u2013108.44), 44.11 ng/ml (18.26-84.08), and 68.14 ng/ml (33.28-174.38), respectively. Among CLL patients there were no significant differences between those with high (N=16; median LPL protein in serum: 38.10 ng/ml (8.72-73.49)) and low (N=26; 43.12 ng/ml (5.66-108.44) (p=0.354) LPL mRNA expression. Thirteen patients with known LPL mRNA expression were investigated for LPL protein \u201crelease\u201d after heparin injection. Ten and twenty minutes after 50 U/kg heparin injection, the elevation of both parameters, LPL protein amount in serum and enzymatic activity in plasma, was similar to those of HD normal values. In detail, medium serum protein levels in samples with high LPL mRNA (N=5) increased from 16.11 to 214.33 and 332.78 ng/ml and in the samples with low mRNA (N=8) from 13.08 to 219.68 and 386.65 ng/ml, respectively. The corresponding median values of the LPL enzymatic activities in high vs. low expressors were: 7.25/15.52/20.01 and 7.45/19.13/20.57 \u03bc M/ml/h. In addition, release of LPL from peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) of CLL patients (N=3) by heparin in vitro was absent. Cell viability and LPL mRNA expression remained unaffected in both in vivo and in vitro samples after heparin addition. In order to assess the impact of LPL on cell survival, CLL cells were cultured (N=3) for up to 72 hours with different doses of purified LPL protein. There was no positive effect on cell survival irrespective of primary LPL mRNA expression or culture conditions (with or without FCS). Since these results point to an intracellular effect of LPL, we aimed to identify downstream targets by knock down with siRNA against LPL in 7 CLL samples and 5 cell lines (hepatocellular carcinoma, cervix carcinoma, colon carcinoma, multiple myeloma and acute monocytic leukemia) with high LPL mRNA expression. Gene expression changes were analyzed by microarrays (GeneChip\u00ae Human Gene 1.0 ST Array, Affymetrix). Fifteen genes were up- (N=4) or downregulated (N=11) in at least 3 of 5 cell lines by more than 1.5-fold (e.g. GSTP1, COROC1). Nine genes were at least 1.5-fold downregulated in parallel with LPL in the CLL samples only. These genes belong to various pathways (e.g. cell cycle, signaling in immune system, metabolism of carbohydrates) and seem to be specific for CLL. Cross-validation of individual genes is under way. Our data suggest that (1) neither basal serum LPL protein levels nor heparin-induced LPL release in CLL patients are suitable clinical prognostic markers; (2) Stimulation with external LPL protein does not affect CLL cell survival; (3) siRNA knock-down of LPL induces changes in various functional pathways. We conclude that the key role of LPL expression in high-risk CLL is related to its (intra)cellular expression. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
