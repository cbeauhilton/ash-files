    "abstract_text": "Upfront resistance to glucocorticoids (GCs) confers a poor prognosis for children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Using primary diagnostic samples from the Children's Oncology Group trial AALL1231, we previously demonstrated that one-third of patient T-ALL samples are intrinsically resistant to GCs when cultured in the presence of interleukin-7 (IL7), a cytokine that is abundant in the T-ALL microenvironment. Furthermore, we demonstrated that inhibiting JAK/STAT signaling downstream of the IL7 receptor (IL7R) with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (RUX) overcomes GC resistance in these samples. The objective of the present study was to determine the mechanism of IL7-induced GC resistance in T-ALL and to identify novel therapeutic targets to enhance GC sensitivity. We utilized CCRF-CEM cells, a human T-ALL cell line, as a model system in conjunction with primary patient samples. Exposing CCRF-CEM cells to IL7 induced phosphorylation of STAT5, the predominant downstream effector of IL7R signaling. When cultured in the presence of IL7 and the GC dexamethasone (DEX), CCRF-CEM cells recapitulated the IL7-induced GC resistance phenotype observed in patient samples. This resistance could be overcome with RUX, and Bliss index analysis demonstrated a synergistic relationship between DEX and RUX in the presence of IL7. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout of STAT5 (STAT5 KO) was sufficient to overcome resistance, implicating STAT5 as the critical mediator of IL7-induced GC resistance. DEX exposure potently induced upregulation of IL7R expression in CCRF-CEM cells. Using a luciferase reporter construct containing a series of STAT5 response elements, we demonstrated that in the presence of IL7, DEX-induced upregulation of IL7R expression is associated with increased downstream signal transduction, leading to a significant increase in STAT5 transcriptional output. We then performed RNA-seq to further assess the functional consequences of this enhanced STAT5-mediated transcription. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that STAT5 target genes were significantly upregulated in cells exposed to DEX and IL7 relative to IL7 alone (normalized enrichment score -2.27; p < 0.001; FDR < 0.001), suggesting that DEX exposure augments activation of the STAT5 transcriptional program. One critical component of this program that was induced by the combination of DEX and IL7 was the anti-apoptotic family member BCL2, which was not induced by DEX alone. Further analysis of its protein expression in CCRF-CEM cells confirmed this paradoxical upregulation of BCL2 specifically by the combination of DEX and IL7. Furthermore, BCL2 was not upregulated by DEX and IL7 in STAT5 KO cells, consistent with this being a STAT5-mediated effect. IL7-induced GC resistance could be overcome with shRNA-mediated knockdown of BCL2 and with pharmacologic inhibition of BCL2 by venetoclax. Similar to the effect observed with RUX, Bliss index analysis demonstrated synergy between DEX and venetoclax in the presence of IL7. Consistent with our observations in CCRF-CEM cells, an analysis of primary diagnostic T-ALL samples revealed DEX-induced upregulation of IL7R expression in samples with IL7-induced GC resistance, which was associated with increased BCL2 expression in the presence of DEX and IL7. Finally, we performed a similar analysis in healthy murine thymocytes, and found that CD4/CD8 double negative (DN) and CD4 or CD8 single positive (SP) thymocytes, but not double positive (DP) thymocytes, exhibited profound IL7-induced GC resistance that was associated with DEX-induced upregulation of IL7R expression and increased BCL2 expression in the presence of DEX and IL7. These data are consistent with the known role of IL7 specifically at the DN and SP stages of development, and suggests that IL7-induced GC resistance is a physiologic mechanism of GC resistance in normal thymocyte development that is retained during leukemogenesis in a subset of T-ALL samples. Taken together, these data demonstrate that GCs paradoxically induce their own resistance in a subset of T-ALLs and in normal developing T-cells by augmenting a STAT5-mediated pro-survival program that results in upregulation of BCL2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling or of BCL2 may have considerable therapeutic benefit to enhance GC sensitivity in T-ALL patients with IL7-induced GC resistance.
