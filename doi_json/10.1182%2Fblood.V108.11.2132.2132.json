    "abstract_text": "The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is effective in controlling BCR-ABL expressing leukemias but resistance occurs in some early phase patients while it is more common in advanced disease. Resistance has been generally associated with mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase that effect drug affinity. However patients are also increasingly reported to fail imatinib therapy while retaining wild-type BCR-ABL expression. Our previous studies suggested a role for Lyn, a Src-related kinase, in imatinib resistance. K562 cells selected for imatinib resistance (K562R) overexpress Lyn kinase and its targeted silencing overcomes imatinib resistance and engages apoptosis. Overexpression of Lyn in K562 cells reduces imatinib sensitivity (3-fold) and patients that fail imatinib therapy in the absence of BCR-ABL mutations express a highly activated Lyn kinase that is not suppressed by imatinib. Silencing Lyn expression in patient specimens induces changes in cell survival that are proportional to the level of Lyn protein reduction. To understand the role of Lyn kinase in imatinib resistance and apoptosis we examined proteins associated with this kinase in imatinib resistant cell lines, leukemic cells overexpressing Lyn and specimens derived from imatinib resistant patients. Lyn overexpression blocked complete suppression of BCR-ABL tyrosine phosphorylation by imatinib and affected BCR-ABL signaling adaptors. Although BCR-ABL forms a stable complex with the leukemogenic-critical adaptor protein Gab2 in imatinib sensitive cells, Lyn overexpression resulted in the formation of Lyn:Gab2 complexed in resistant cells. BCR-ABL kinase inhibition failed to reduce tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab2 in these cells while Lyn silencing or kinase inhibition (with dasatinib) completely suppressed Gab2 tyrosine phosphorylation and correlated with the induction of apoptosis. Lyn silencing in K562R cells also lead to a reciprocal increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation and association with a protein of ~120kDa, identified as the E3 ligase, c-Cbl. Lyn overexpression in K562 cells reduced their imatinib sensitivity and reduced c-Cbl protein levels. Kinase inhibitor and co-transfection studies demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl at a critical signaling site (Y774) is primarily controlled by BCR-ABL and deletion or mutation of the c-Cbl RING domain altered its BCR-ABL phosphorylation. These results suggest that c-Cbl complexes are regulated at both the protein and phosphorylation level by Lyn and BCR-ABL kinase activities, respectively. Overexpression and/or activation of Lyn may disrupt the balance and regulation of critical regulators of leukemogenic signaling (Gab2) or protein trafficking and stability (c-Cbl), resulting in increased cell survival and reduced responsiveness to BCR-ABL kinase inhibition. We conclude that Lyn alters the level and function of critical signaling adaptor proteins in CML cells.",
