    "abstract_text": "Background: Thalidomide with dexamethasone is considered the current standard induction therapy for multiple myeloma. Previously, treatment consisted mainly of infusional vincristine, adrimaycin and dexamethasone (VAD). High dose thalidomide is associated with significant toxicity. We conducted a study to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of adding liposomal adriamycin (Doxil\u00ae) to dexamethasone and low dose thalidomide. Stem cell harvest yield was also assessed. Methods: Patients were treated with Doxil\u00ae 40mg/m 2 IV d1, thalidomide 100 mg PO Q HS, and dexamethasone 40 mg PO d1\u20134 and 15\u201318 Q 28 days for 4 cycles. After 4 cycles, eligible patients underwent autologous stem cell transplant. Patients received prophylactic Amoxicillin 250 mg PO Q day and Acyclovir 200 mg PO BID. Erythropoietin and biphosphonates were administered. Aspirin was changed to full dose coumadin anticoagulation after one death from pulmonary embolism. Results: Between 3/03 and 5/05, 11 out of planned 25 patients were enrolled on the study; 1 patient excluded for wrong diagnosis. Median age 61.5 (51\u201381yrs); 7 males; 7 IgG, 2 IgA and 1\u03bb-light chain subtypes; Stage IB-1, Stage IIA-4, Stage IIIA-5; median albumin 3.75 (range:1.6\u20135.1 g/dL), creatinine 0.95 (range: 0.7 \u2013 2.7 mg/dL) and B 2 M 1.95 (range: 1.1\u201310.1 mg/L). Four patients completed 4 cycles; one is undergoing treatment; three patients taken off study-one after 2 cycles per patient\u2019s request, one secondary to grade 4 toxicity after cycle 1, and another after greater than 3 weeks treatment delay after cycle 3 secondary to pneumonia. Three patients (30%) developed grade 3\u20134 toxicities- two due to pneumonia (after cycles 2 and 3, respectively); and one with dehydration and renal failure after cycle 1. There were 2 deaths-one secondary to pulmonary embolism after cycle 1; another due to myocardial infarction after cycle 2. Two patients developed VTE- one after cycle 1 while on low dose coumadin; another died of pulmonary embolism after cycle 1, while on aspirin, requiring amendment to full dose coumadin anticoagulation. No further thrombotic episodes were encountered. Five patients underwent stem cell harvest with cyclophosphamide mobilization. The median harvest yield was 9.76 x10 6 CD34/kg (range: 5.27 \u2013 31.94) with a median of 1 day (range: 1\u20137) to achieve at least 5 x 10 6 CD34/kg. Of the ten patients who received at least one cycle and assessable for response, the ORR was 80% (near complete remission(nCR)-10%; PR-70%), 1 MR, 1 SD. The M-spike response after first cycle of therapy ranged from 8% to 71%, with six patients (60%) having greater than 50% reduction in M-protein level. One patient achieved nCR after 2 cycles. Responses after the 3rd and 4th cycles were minimal. Conclusions: Doxil\u00ae, dexamethasone and low dose thalidomide represents an active induction therapy for patients with untreated multiple myeloma. Major responses were achieved rapidly, arguing for early stem cell harvest and autologous transplant after two cycles of therapy. Treatment related complications occurred early in the course of treatment. Full dose anticoagulation to prevent deep venous thromboembolism is essential when using this combination regimen. No adverse impact on stem cell harvest is associated with this therapy.",
