    "abstract_text": "The regulation of hemostasis and thrombus formation is a tightly controlled event that has catastrophic consequences when it is deregulated. One of the hallmarks of the thrombus is aggregated platelets. Upon platelet stimulation, adhesion molecules become activated and mediate multiple cell-cell interactions. Therapeutically, blocking platelet adhesion is a proven method for preventing pathological arterial thrombus formation. However, targeting the primary adhesion receptor, integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 , results in severe bleeding complications. Therefore, identifying novel proteins or uncovering novel functions for known proteins in platelets is a necessary first step to facilitate the development of safer anti-platelet therapeutics. We have identified that the cell adhesion molecule cadherin-6 forms a functional adhesion complex with \u03b1-catenin and \u03b2-catenin in platelets. The goal of our project was to determine the mechanism of cadherin-6 mediated adhesion in platelets. Our initial experiments demonstated that cadherin-6 and \u03b2-catenin co-localize at the plasma membrane in platelets using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. We determined that \u03b1-catenin and \u03b2-catenin co-immunoprecipitate with cadherin-6 from platelet lysates. To examine the functional role of cadherin-6 on platelet aggregation we used a cadherin-6 blocking antibody (10 \u03bcg/ml). Blocking cadherin-6 inhibited mouse platelet aggregation induced by PAR4 peptide. We next determined the role of cadherin-6 in vivo by examining carotid artery thrombosis after 7.5% FeCl 3 treatment. C57Bl6 mice were injected with cadherin-6 antibody IV and labeled with rhodamine 6G by jugular vein injection. Thrombus formation was imaged in real time by fluorescent intravital microscopy. Blocking cadherin-6 prevented thrombosis for the duration of the experiment (30 min). To verify that the effects that we observed were specific to cadherin-6 expressed on platelets, we isolated platelets from donor mice and treated with cadherin-6 antibody or control IgG ex vivo. The treated platelets were perfused into recipient mice that were irradiated with 11 Gy to make the animals thrombocytopenic. The cadherin-6 antibody treated platelets formed an occlusion at 26.4 \u00b1 3.6 min vs. 13.7 \u00b1 2.0 min for the IgG (p=0.03). Importantly, the cadherin-6 antibody did not affect platelet counts compared to IgG controls 2.97 \u00b1 0.40 (\u00d710 8 ) vs. 3.02 \u00b1 0.20 (\u00d710 8 ). These combined studies show that caderhin-6 forms a complex with the necessary proteins required to mediate adhesion in platelets. Our results demonstrate that platelet cadherin-6 has a physiologically important role during platelet activation and thrombus formation in vivo. In summary, we have identified a novel adhesion complex in platelets that may provide a mechanism to limit platelet aggregation therapeutically. On going studies will determine the regulation of the cadherin-6/catenin complex and how cadherin-6 cooperates with other platelet adhesion molecules.
