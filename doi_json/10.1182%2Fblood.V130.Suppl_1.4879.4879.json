    "abstract_text": "Background: Recent results show a protective effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding in patients with postpartum hemorrhage in low- and middle-resource countries. We set out toquantify the association between early administration of tranexamic acid compared to late or no administration and severe acute maternal morbidity and blood loss among women suffering from persistent severe postpartum hemorrhage in a high-income country. Methods and Findings: We performed a nationwide retrospective cohort study in 61 hospitals in the Netherlands.The study population consisted of 1260 women with persistent postpartum hemorrhage who had received at least four units of red cells, or fresh frozen plasma or platelets in addition to red cells. A review of medical records was performed and cross-referenced with blood bank data. The composite endpoint comprised maternal morbidity (hysterectomy, ligation of the uterine arteries, emergency B-Lynch suture, arterial embolization or admission into an intensive care unit) and mortality. Results: 247 women received early tranexamic acid treatment. After adjustment for confounding, odds ratio for the composite endpoint for early tranexamic acid (n= 247) versus no/late tranexamic acid (n= 984) was 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.27). Propensity matched analysis confirmed the absence of a difference between women with and without tranexamic acid. Blood loss after administration of first line therapy did not differ significantly between the two groups (adjusted difference -177 mL, CI -509.4 to +155.0). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that in a high-resource country the effect of tranexamic acid on both blood loss and the combined endpoint of maternal mortality and morbidity may be disappointing.
