    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1197 Coagulation is a finely tuned process. During thrombin formation, several anticoagulant reactions are initiated to prevent systematic activation of coagulation, and impairment of anticoagulant activity causes an increased risk of venous thrombosis. One such anticoagulant factor is protein S, deficiencies of which have been linked to venous and arterial thrombosis. While protein S has been studied for over three decades, the precise role this protein plays in attenuating the hemostatic response is far from clear. Protein S is a vitamin K-dependent plasma protein that functions in feedback regulation of thrombin generation. Protein S was initially identified as a cofactor for activated protein C (APC) but later it was observed that there is only a 3\u201310 fold increase in APC activity in the presence of protein S. Plasma coagulation assays in the absence of APC suggest that protein S may have other anticoagulant role(s). We report here an anticoagulant activity of Protein S mediated by inhibition of fIXa in the absence and presence of fVIIIa independent of APC. Although an APC-independent anticoagulant activity has been reported for protein S interacting with fVIIIa, no study has shown that the inhibitory effect of protein S is mediated through its interaction with fIXa, thus making our observations novel and significant. Moreover, previous studies that reported an interaction between fVIIIa and protein S were performed with low amounts of phospholipid, a condition that produces activity measurement artifacts due to the presence of active protein S multimers. We used both ex vivo (plasma studies) and in vitro methods at high phospholipid (100\u2013200 micro molar) concentration to determine whether and how the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation is regulated by protein S. We obtained the following results: 1) activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assays with protein S-supplemented plasma confirmed that protein S prolongs clotting time, and a normal clotting time was restored with addition of anti-protein S antibody, 2) a modified aPPT assay with fIX-deficient plasma confirmed that protein S affects fIX-initiated clotting time, 3) thrombin generation assay through fIXa/fVIIIa pathway, initiated with a limiting amount of tissue factor (TF), was regulated by protein S, 4) in vitro studies with fIXa/fVIIIa and protein S in the presence of phosphatidylserine (PS) vesicles showed \u223c40% and \u223c65% inhibition in the activity of fIXa in the absence and presence of fVIIIa, respectively, and 5) protein S altered only the K M for fX activation by fIXa but altered both k cat and K M for fX activation by fIXa and fVIIIa. Our findings underscore the central role of protein S in regulation of coagulation. We anticipate these results will unravel important implications for the evaluation of thrombotic risk associated with protein S-deficiency.
