    "abstract_text": "MEIS proteins constitute an important subgroup of three amino acid loop extension (TALE) class transcription factors, which are characterized by an atypical homeodomain. MEIS1 has been shown to act as an important cofactor in HOXA9-mediated leukemogenesis in bone marrow transduction experiments. In human leukemia, MEIS1 was identified as a gene consistently upregulated in leukemias with MLL translocations. However, MEIS1 overexpression is also frequently found in AMLs with normal or complex karyotypes. To investigate the role of MEIS1 in AML pathogenesis, we measured the expression of MEIS1 and MEIS2 in 26 different established human AML cell lines, and documented high levels of expression of one or both genes in 20 of these lines. Despite the prevalence of MEIS1 expression in AML blasts, the downstream pathways and their contribution to the proliferation or self-renewal of the malignant clone are not well understood. To identify gene expression programs controlled by MEIS1, we targeted MEIS1 expression by RNAi in two AML cell lines that express HOXA9 and MEIS1, but only low levels of MEIS2. In comparison to a control shRNA, cells expressing two different MEIS1-specific shRNAs were markedly deficient in thymidine incorporation indicating very low levels of cellular proliferation. The RNAi-mediated knock-down of MEIS1 expression resulted in down-regulation of the tyrosine kinase receptor FLT3 by quantitative RT-PCR. Thus our data in human AML is consistent with results of Wang et al. (Blood, 106(1):254\u201364) implicating MEIS1 in the regulation of FLT3 tyrosine kinase expression, based on overexpression studies in mouse bone marrow progenitors. Our results in human AML suggest that MEIS1 is required for high levels of FLT3 expression, which is significant because FLT3 is mutated and activated in these two myeloid leukemia cell lines, suggesting the hypothesis that FLT3 is an important component of the pathway through which MEIS1 promotes proliferation. Programmed re-expression of activated FLT3 in AML lines with MEIS knock-down is underway to test whether FLT3 is the essential component acting downstream of MEIS1 expression in AML pathogenesis.",
