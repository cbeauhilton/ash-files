    "abstract_text": "Aging leads to impairment of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function with decreased self-renewal, imbalanced differentiation potential and an increased risk to develop myeloid malignancies. These malignancies are associated with epigenetic deregulation, which contributes to pathogenesis. Notably, studies in murine models have revealed epigenetic changes in aged HSC. However, it is unknown if this occurs in normal human HSC aging and whether it may contribute to HSC dysfunction. Therefore, we performed comprehensive epigenomic and transcriptional profiling in primary human HSC (Lin-, CD34+, CD38-) isolated from young (18-30 yo), mid (45-55 yo) and old (65-75 yo) healthy donors. Using a micro-ChIP-seq protocol we profiled H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac in 4-7 donors per age group, as well as genome-wide DNA methylation (5mC), hydroxymethylation (5hmC) and RNA-seq. Analysis of enhancer-associated marks revealed that with age there is marked reduction in both H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (20,783 and 15,625 peaks lost, respectively; log10likelihood ratio >3). Gene ontology analysis of these lost peaks revealed their association with genes involved in hematopoiesis and, RNA splicing and chromatin organization, respectively (ChIPenrich, FDRH3K4me3, H3K27ac-) and active (H3K4me1>H3K4me3, H3K27ac+) enhancers. We found age-related loss of H3K4me1 enrichment at 10,696 poised enhancers, which are associated with hematopoiesis and T- and B-cell receptor signaling (FDR20%). However, these subtle changes also target genes associated with cadherin and WNT signaling. Finally, RNA-seq analysis revealed that this age-associated epigenetic reprogramming is accompanied by an overall trend to gene downregulation. Amongst the genes most affected are the nuclear lamin gene LMNA (mutated in progeria syndrome), splicing factors SRSF7 and U2AF1 and, the transcription factors KLF3/6 and HIF1 \u03b1 (FDR 1.5). Notably, changes in expression also include significant differential exon usage, which may be mediated by DHMR at intron-exon boundaries: 575 genes show altered exon usage (FDR 1.5) including LMNA and the epigenetic modifiers BRD9, CITED2, KDM6A and SETD6 . In summary, we have completed the first comprehensive epigenomic profiling of aging in human HSC. Our findings show massive epigenetic remodeling in aged HSC, consisting of loss of activating histone marks primarily targeting enhancers and bivalent promoters at genes involved in hematopoiesis and developmental pathways. Cytosine modifications show widespread changes in 5hmC, targeting intron-exon boundaries. Globally, this epigenetic reprogramming results in overall gene downregulation and altered splicing of genes important for HSC regulation. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
