    "abstract_text": "Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for multiple myeloma (MM) offers a unique setting to incorporate immunotherapy in an effort to target residual disease. Our group has developed a cancer vaccine in which dendritic cells (DCs) are fused to autologous tumor cells resulting in the presentation of multiple tumor antigens with the capacity to elicit a broad anti-tumor response. A fundamental challenge to developing a more effective tumor vaccine is overcoming the immunosuppressive milieu by which tumor cells evade host immunity. Up-regulation of the PD-1/PDL1 pathway represents a key element contributing to tumor-mediated tolerance, and potentially muting response to vaccination. We are conducting a clinical trial in which patients with MM are treated with an anti-PD1 antibody (Pidilizumab, MDV9300) in combination with a dendritic cell/myeloma fusion cell vaccine following autologous transplantation. 22 patients have been treated with post-transplant immunotherapy. Mean age was 64. MM cells were isolated from bone marrow and were identified by expression of CD38 or CD138. Mean tumor cell yield was 118x10 6 cells. Adherent mononuclear cells were isolated from leukapheresis collections and cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4 for 5-7 days, then exposed to TNF\u03b1 for 48-72 hours to generate mature DCs. DCs expressed co-stimulatory (mean CD86 75%) and maturation markers (mean CD83 50%). DC and MM cells were co-cultured with PEG and fusion cells were quantified by determining the percentage of cells that co-express unique DC and myeloma antigens. Mean fusion efficiency was 41% and the mean cell dose generated was 4 x 10 6 fusion cells. Mean viability of the DC, myeloma, and fusion preparations was 92%, 89%, and 85%, respectively. As a measure of their potency as antigen presenting cells, DC/MM fusions potently stimulate allogeneic T cell proliferation ex-vivo (Mean stimulation index of 1.9, 9.2 and 7.1 for tumor, DC and DC/myeloma fusions respectively, n=21) Post-transplant immunotherapy was initiated after recovery from transplant-related toxicities. Median time from transplant to initiation of post-transplant immunotherapy was 80 days. Patients received 3 doses of Pidilizumab at 6-week intervals. DC/myeloma fusion cells vaccination is administered 1 week before each dose of Pidilizumab. To date, 22 patients have completed vaccinations and Pidilizumab. Adverse events judged to be potentially treatment related included grade 1-2 diarrhea, arthralgias, myalgias, fatigue, headache, nausea, chills, transaminitis, cytopenia, elevated TSH, and vaccine site reactions. A significant increase in circulatingtumor reactive lymphocytes was noted following post-transplant immunotherapy, as determined by T cell expressionof IFN-\u03b3 by CD8 cells following ex-vivo co-culture withautologous myeloma cell lysate. Mean percentage of tumor reactiveCD8 cells increased from 1.8% post-transplant to a peak of 9.16% following immunotherapy. In the post-transplant period, regulatory T cells fell to minimal levels and remained low throughout the period of immunotherapy. 6 patients achieved a best response of VGPR, 6 patients have achieved a nCR/CR, including 3 who converted to CR following immunotherapy. Median PFS from transplant is 19 months with ongoing follow up. In summary, DC/MM fusion cell vaccination in conjunction with PD1 blockade following ASCT was well tolerated, potently induced anti-tumor immunity, and in a subset of patients, resulted in the eradication of post-transplant measurable disease.
