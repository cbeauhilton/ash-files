    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1197 Poster Board I-219 Abstract Purpose: To compare the outcomes of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from partially matched related donors (PMRDs) or unrelated donors (URDs) for hematologic malignancies without the use of in vitro T cell depletion (TCD). Experimental Design: 297 consecutive patients were performed HSCT from URDs (n = 78) or PMRDs (n = 219) during the same time period. Incidences of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse, non-relapse mortality (NRM), overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) are compared between the PMRD and URD groups. Results: All patients achieved full engraftment. The cumulative incidences of grades II to IV acute GVHD in the PMRD and URD cohorts were 47% (95% CI, 33%-62%) versus 31% (CI, 20%-42%, P = .033), with a relative risk (RR) = 1.72 (1.01-2.94), P = .046. The incidence of chronic GVHD did not differ significantly between the two cohorts (P = .17). Two-year incidences of NRM and relapse were 20% (CI, 15%-26%) versus 18% (CI, 10%-27%), with P = 0.98, and 12% (CI, 8%-16%) versus 18% (CI, 10%-27%), with P = .12, for the PMRD versus URD cohort respectively. Four-year OS and LFS were 74% (CI, 67%-80%) versus 74% (CI, 62%-85%), with P = .98, and 67% (CI, 59%-75%) versus 61% (CI, 47%-74%), with P = .74, respectively. Conclusions: Our comparisons demonstrate that every major end point, including relapse, NRM, OS and LFS, was comparable between the PMRD and URD groups. Table.
