    "abstract_text": "Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) remains the standard of care for Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients younger than 70 years old. The role of induction therapy is crucial within a program of high-dose therapy since deeper is the response before, higher is the outcome of transplant. In this study, we analyzed a real life setting of patients treated with three different induction approaches: VAD (Vincristine-Adriamycin-Dexamethasone), VD (Bortezomib - Dexamethasone), and VTD (Bortezomib-Thalidomide-Dexamethasone) in terms of depth of response, 2 years therapy-free rate and toxicity. One hundred and sixty-three MM patients (pts) were included in the analysis: 62 pts treated with VAD (38%) , 44 with VD (27%) and 57 with VTD (35%). In VTD group 49 pts (86%) received Bortezomib subcutaneously. As shown in Table 1, patients of the three groups were similar for D&S stage (p 0.59), a higher rate of ISS stage 3 was observed in VAD group (p=0.019), patients in VTD group were significantly older (p=0.024), median follow-up was significantly lower in VTD pts (p 0.9), and of discontinuation rate (14% in VTD and 18% in VD, p=0.395) . The incidence of all grades peripheral neuropathy (PN) was similar between VD and VTD (28.2% and 31.4% p=0.835), but grade 3-4 PN was significantly higher in VD group (no patients in VTD vs 18% in VD pts, p=0.078), probably due to different way of Bortezomib administration in VTD group (86% of pts received subcutaneous Bortezomib). In this study, we confirm that Bortezomib-based regimens are better than VAD in terms of overall response rate, good quality responses and long-term disease control. VTD is superior to VD in terms of good quality responses after transplant but disease control at 2 years is similar.
