    "abstract_text": "Nuclear condensation and enucleation are characteristic processes in mammalian terminal erythropoiesis. These processes are associated with the transient nuclear opening formation that mediates partial histone release to the cytoplasm. Our previous report showed that caspases are involved in the cleavage of nuclear lamina to enable histone release. However, it remains unclear whether nuclear opening formation and histone release regulate the genomic three-dimensional organization during nuclear condensation. To answer this question, we cultured E13.5 mouse fetal liver Ter119 negative erythroid progenitor cells in erythropoietin (EPO) containing medium for 48 h with or without the presence of caspase inhibitor. As expected, caspase inhibitor blocked nuclear opening formation and histone release, and significantly reduced nuclear condensation and enucleation. We next performed a Hi-C sequencing to investigate chromatin structural change during terminal differentiation and nuclear condensation. To this end, the cultured fetal liver erythroid cells with or without caspase inhibitor were harvested at 30 h right before enucleation for Hi-C sequencing. The sequencing results showed that cells at 30 h contain significantly more interactions than freshly isolated erythroid progenitors, which is consistent with chromatin condensation during terminal erythropoiesis. Further analysis showed that increased interactions mainly accumulate as inter-chromosomal interactions, suggesting inter-chromosome interaction is the dominant structural force driving erythrocyte chromatin condensation. Surprisingly, there were no significant chromatin structural changes between caspase inhibitor treated and mock-treated cells when compared at 30 h. We also performed ATAC-seq and RNA-seq with the same experiment settings, both corresponded to Hi-C sequencing and showed little difference under caspase inhibitor treatment. These results indicate that although histone release and nuclear condensation are compromised with the inhibition of caspases, chromatin stays condensed with well-organized three-dimensional structure and appropriate gene expression regulations. To further confirm this phenomenon, we generated caspase-3 and -7 double knock out ( cas3cas7-/- ) mice. Cas3cas7-/- mice are embryonically lethal due to defective cardiac development. The hematopoietic tissues in these mice have not been well studied. We harvested fetal liver Ter119 negative erythroid progenitor cells from E13.5 cas3cas7-/- mice and the cells from the littermate ( cas7-/- , cas3+/-cas7-/- ) mice were used as controls. We first cultured Ter119 negative fetal liver erythroid progenitors in EPO containing medium for 48 h. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the nuclear opening was significantly inhibited, and the nuclear size significantly increased in the erythroid cells from cas3cas7-/- mice due to failure of histone release into cytoplasm. Flow cytometry analysis showed that enucleation was significantly impaired in cas3cas7-/- cells, but the cells could still differentiate although with lower efficiency. We further performed an in vivo assay in which E13.5 cas3cas7-/- fetal liver cells were transplanted into wild type lethally irradiated recipient mice. EPO medium cultured bone marrow lineage negative cells from these transplanted mice showed significant reduction in nuclear opening and histone release, and enlargement of nuclear size. However, these mice survived well despite anemia. These results indicate a portion of orthochromatic erythroblasts managed to enucleate even with the less condensed nuclei. Overall, our study demonstrates that nuclear opening and histone release are essential for nuclear condensation but have minimal effects on chromatin condensation or the regulation of gene expression in terminal erythropoiesis. Appropriate nuclear condensation is important for efficient enucleation. However, orthochromatic erythroblasts could still manage to enucleate although with low efficacies.
