    "abstract_text": "Background : Approximately 50% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) are defined as high-grade by IPI. They are characterized by aggressive course and poor response to standard chemotherapy (CT): 5-years overall survival (OS) rate of less than 30%. R-DA-EPOCH has demonstrated very optimistic results (overall and progression-free survival (PFS) were 90%), but high-risk patients (IPI 3-4) showed only 43% of OS and PFS [1]. The addition of high-dose AraC (12 g/m 2 ) to the upfront therapy of high-risk DLBCL has significantly improved the outcome on Hyper-CVAD/HMA and mNHL-BFM-90 protocols [2, 3]. But high toxicity of these protocols restricts their application. We suggested that addition of courses R-HMA in rotation with R-DA-EPOCH could improve the treatment outcome and decrease toxicity. Aim : To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of R-DA-EPOCH/R-HMA protocol in patients with untreated high-grade diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patients and Methods: 33 untreated DLBCL patients from 4 centers were enrolled in a prospective study between August 2013 - July 2015; stage II-IV; ECOG 0-3; median age 55 years (27-76); age \u226560y/<60y 50%/50%; M/F 60%/40%; IPI: 48% high-intermediate and 52% high risk; 15% with bone marrow involvement. All patients underwent 4-8 courses (2-4 cycles) of chemotherapy: R-DA-EPOCH (standard dose and scheme), R-HMA (R 375 mg/m 2 d1, MTX 1000 mg/m 2 24 hours d 2, AraC 3000 mg/m 2 q 12 hrs d 3-4). For patients older than 60 year dose of R-HMA was reduced (R 375 mg/m 2 d1, MTX 500 mg/m 2 24 hours d 2, AraC 1000 mg/m 2 q 12 hrs d 3-4). In 4 cases of DLBCL with bone marrow involvement BEAM conditioning and autologous stem cell transplantation were applied. Results : The median follow-up is 12 months (4-24). There was no mortality associated with toxicity. The main non-hematological toxicities of R-HMA were infections (mucositis, pneumonia, sepsis, enteropathy) grades 1-2 and 3-4 in 90% and 10%, respectively. Hematological toxicity grade 4 for less than 4 days we observed only after courses R-HMA. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 29 (88%) patients. In 2 patients we observed progression of the disease after first cycle of chemotherapy, in another 2 cases - partial remission after 2-3 cycles and following progression of disease. In patients older than 60 years with doses reduction in R-HMA failures were absent, except one later relapse after 13 month CR. With a median follow 12 months overall and disease-free survival of 33 patients constituted 90,5% and 74% , respectively. In a group of patients older than 60 years results of therapy seemed to be better than in young patients: OS were 100% vs 85,6% (p=0,1), DFS were 80% vs 74,9% (p=0,2), respectively. So the combination of R-DA-EPOCH/R-HMA may be considered as optimal intensive approach in the older patients. Conclusions: TheR-DA-EPOCH/R-HMA protocol demonstrated acceptable toxicity and high efficacy in patients with high-grade DLBCL. This protocol has shown optimistic results in the elderly patients and it could be recommended for further investigation in that group. \u00d1\u00f1\u00fb\u00eb\u00ea\u00e8: 1.
