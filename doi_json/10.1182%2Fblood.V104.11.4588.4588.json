    "abstract_text": "In this retrospective study we described the response and toxicity of a modified Magrath IVAC (mIVAC) regimen in 25 patients with refractory/relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The mIVAC consisted of ifosfamide 1,500mg/m 2 (one-hour infusion beginning at 9:00; D1 to D5), mesna 300mg/m 2 (bolus at hours 9:00, 13:00, 17:00; D1 to D5), citarabine 2,000 mg/m 2 (two one-hour infusions beginning at 8:00 and 16:00; D1 and D2) and etoposide 60 mg/m 2 (one-hour infusion beginning at 10:00; D1 to D5). Treatment was repeated every four weeks for a maximum of six cycles. Patients who achieved partial remission or complete remission after at least three courses were offered autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), if eligible. The median age was 37 years (range 18 to 59 years). Twenty-two (88%) patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, fourteen (56%) had relapsed disease and 10 (40%) were considered high-intermediate and high risk by age-adjusted International Prognostic Index. The overall response rate was 68% (95% CI: 46%\u201390%). A total of 64 cycles were given, with a median of three courses per patient. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed after 85,6% of the courses, and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was observed after 87,5% of the courses. Grade 3/4 neutropenic fever occurred after 28% of the courses. Non-hematologic toxic effects were rare, predominantly grade 1/2. No toxic deaths were observed. Fifteen (88%) of the 17 responding patients underwent ASCT. With a median follow-up of 14 months, the median overall survival time for mIVAC sensitive patients was 16 months. This regimen may be feasible for patient with relapsed and refractory aggressive NHL in countries with inadequate numbers of hospital beds.",
