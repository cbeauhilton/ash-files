    "abstract_text": "44 patients with relapsed or refractory CD20+ NHL were enrolled on a phase I trial of dose-escalated 90 YZ followed by high-dose BEAM and autotransplant in which the 90 YZ dose was patient-specific based on dosimetry. 90 YZ doses were calculated to deliver cohort-defined radiation doses (100\u20131700 cGy) to critical organs (liver, lung or kidney) with 3\u20136 patients per cohort. On D-22, rituximab (R) 250 mg/m 2 was infused followed by 111 In Zevalin\u00ae. Imaging was performed immediately and at 4, 24, 72 and 144 hours; dosimetry was performed on D-15. On D-14, R was followed immediately by 90 YZ at the cohort-prescribed dose. On D-6 through D-1, patients received high-dose BEAM. On D0, a minimum of 2.0 \u00d7 10 6 CD 34+ cells/kg was infused and G-CSF 5 \u03bcg/kg SQ daily begun. The median age was 54 (range: 25\u201373) years. NHL histologic subtypes were as follows: 16% mantle cell, 57% diffuse aggressive, 11% low-grade and 16% transformed. 43% had recieved 3 or more chemotherapy regimens, and 70% had received R either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The toxicity profile was similar to that associated with high-dose BEAM. The most common grade III/IV toxicities were infection, fever, stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. One patient experienced transient veno-occlusive disease at the 700 cGy dose level. Two dose-limiting toxicities occurred at the 1700 cGy dose level: one patient with grade 4 stomatitis died of pneumonia and sepsis on D+10, and one patient experienced septic emboli to the lung on D+13. Engraftment occurred at a median of 10 days (range: 8\u201318 ) to granulocytes \u2265 500/\u03bcL, and 21 days (range: 11\u201340 days) to platelets \u226520,000/\u03bcL. One heavily pretreated patient developed MDS on D+291 and expired of sepsis on D+483. With a median follow-up of 21 months, the three year overall and progression-free survivals are 52% and 37%, respectively. 90 YZ Zevalin \u00ae Dosing for Cohorts 5\u20139 (median;range)  Cohort (cGy) .

Although patient-specific doses calculated to deliver a cohort-prescribed absorbed radiation dose to the critical organ were highly variable, the two dose-limiting toxicities ocurred at nearly identical doses (1.14, 1.20 mCi/kg) when calculated according to weight. Whereas eight other patients safely received at least twice the conventional 0.4 mCi/kg dose, 0.8 mCi/kg is the recommended dose for phase II studies, if dosing is to be based on weight and not dosimetry. Outcomes are encouraging given the high-risk patient population. A phase III trial will be required to establish whether or not the addition of 90 YZ to high-dose BEAM improves outcomes in NHL patients undergoing autotransplant.",
