    "abstract_text": "Abstract 930 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell growth and survival occur in defined microenvironment niches controlled by several receptor/ligand interactions including those mediated by the \u03b14\u03b21 integrin. This integrin, in particular, is known to interact with both the extracellular matrix component fibronectin, via the non-RGD CS-1 fragments, and the bone marrow/stromal components, via the vascular-cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The \u03b14 integrin chain (a.k.a. CD49d) has been previously shown to be associated with poor prognosis in CLL by marking a subset of CLL patients characterized by a more aggressive clinical course both in term of disease progression and overall survival. Despite the great deal of studies investigating CLL cell microenvironmental interactions in tissue sites, little is known regarding the constitutive engagement of adhesion receptors in circulating CLL cells, and the role in this context of plasma/plasma components. To address this issue, the proteomic profiles of circulating leukemic cells from 80 CLL cases expressing or not CD49d were explored using a reverse phase protein microarray (RPMA) approach quantitatively analysing 77 proteins (61 phosphoproteins) known to be involved in translational control, cell growth, apoptosis, B cell receptor and cytoskeletal signaling. Comparison of the signaling activation portrait between 40 CD49d pos and 40 CD49d neg CLL cases highlighted the over-expression in CD49d pos CLL of proteins involved in the regulation of integrin-mediated cytoskeletal dynamics, such as phospho-p21-activated kinase (PAK1 Ser199-204/PAK2 Ser192-197; p=0.0005), phospho-LIM kinase (LIMK1 Thr508/LIMK2 Thr505; p=0.00001) and the adaptor protein CrkII Tyr221 (p=0.039). Moreover, CD49d pos CLL cells were characterized by a high correlation between proteins involved in integrin-mediated signal trasduction, including the focal-adhesion kinase (FAK Tyr576-Ser577), the tyrosine kinase Src Tyr527 and the adaptor protein CrkL Tyr207. Since PAK and LIMK represent key players in the modulation of the structure and the activity of actin cytoskeleton, we focused on these proteins for validation experiments. The constitutive pPAK and pLIMK overexpression in the CD49d pos CLL group was confirmed by western blot analysis comparing purified CLL cells from 3 CD49d pos versus 3 CD49d neg cases (mean fold increase >100 for both proteins). The results obtained suggest that integrin signalling is constitutively active in CD49d-expressing circulating CLL cells, pointing to a constitutive receptor engagement by CD49d ligands allegedly present in plasma. To test whether plasma constituents could modulate integrin-signaling proteins, CLL cells from 5 cases, expressing or not CD49d, were challenged with autologous plasma (1:3 dilution) for 30 seconds, 1 and 3 minutes. The presence of plasma induced a strong increase of PAK and LIMK phosphorylation intensities in CD49d pos CLL cells, starting at 30 seconds upon stimulation (mean fold increase >10 as compared to control for both proteins), and increasing after 1 and 3 minutes (mean fold increase >40 and >50 for both the proteins, respectively). Conversely, plasma stimulation did not induce pPAK and pLIMK expression modulation in CD49d neg CLL cells. Of note, pretreatment of CD49d-expressing CLL cells with the anti-CD49d HP1/2 blocking antibody, resulted in lower up-regulation of pPAK and pLIMK with an overall 60% inhibition for both the proteins (p=0.01), confirming the involvement of CD49d triggering in the observed activated signaling. Given the above results, we investigated plasma from 24 CLL patients, expressing CD49d at different levels, for the presence of the CD49d ligand fibronectin using an ELISA detection kit. All samples tested showed more than 1 mg/ml fibronectin concentration, without differences between CD49d-expressing and CD49d neg CLL cases. Altogether these results sustain the hypothesis of an active role of plasma/plasma components in the activation of CD49d-mediated integrin pathway, thus favoring the delivery of chemoresistance/pro-survival signals even in the context of circulating CLL cells. Our results may be of interest in the perspective of novel therapies (e.g. Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors) known to provoke a massive egress of neoplastic cells from tissue sites into the blood stream.
