    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1335 Fanconi anemia (FA) is associated with a hereditary predisposition to bone marrow failure. The proteins encoded by the FANC genes are primarily involved in DNA repair responses through the formation of a large, multisubunit complex that has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity ( Annual Review of Genetics 2009;43:223). FA hematopoietic stem cells display defective stem cell properties and limited replicative potential. However, the molecular basis for how a FA genetic background contributes to those defects remains poorly understood. Here we provide evidence that FANCL, which has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, enhances beta-catenin activity ( Figure A ) and protein expression. Beta-catenin is a nuclear effector of canonical Wnt signaling. The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is active in normal hematopoietic stem cells in the native bone marrow environment and disruption of this signaling pathway results in defective hematopoietic stem cells ( Nature 2003;423:409). To test whether FANCL positively regulates beta-catenin through its ubiquitination activity, we performed cell-based ubiquitination assays. We show that FANCL functionally ubiquitinates beta-catenin ( Figure B ) and that ubiquitin chain extension can occur via non-lysine-48 ubiquitin linkages. Accumulating evidence reveal diverse, non-proteolytic biological roles for proteins modified by atypical ubiquitin chains ( EMBO Reports 2008;9:536). Our data suggests that FANCL may enhance the protein function of beta-catenin via ubiquitination with atypical ubiquitin chains. Importantly, we demonstrate that suppression of FANCL expression in human CD34+ cord blood stem cells reduces beta-catenin expression ( Figure C ) and multilineage progenitor expansion. These results demonstrate a role for the FA pathway in regulating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Therefore, diminished Wnt/beta-catenin signaling may be an important underlying molecular defect in FA hematopoietic stem cells leading to their accelerated loss.
