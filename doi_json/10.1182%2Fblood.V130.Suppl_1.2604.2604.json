    "abstract_text": "Introduction. The prognosis of patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R ALL), especially after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), is very poor. Therapeutic options for these pts are limited. Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE\u00ae) antibody construct with dual specificity for CD19 and CD3. BiTE\u00ae therapy may help to overcome the resistance to chemotherapy (CT) with minimal toxicity, and may be a bridge to allo-HSCT. Patients and Methods. We analyzed data of 52 pts from 7 hematologic centers in Russian Federation with CD19 positive R/R ALL, who received BiTE\u00ae. The median age was 21 (range 1-53) years, 18 (35%) pts 50% in 25 pts. Disease relapse was revealed after CT in 31 pts. Allo-HSCT after BiTE\u00ae therapy was performed 12 (39%) pts (4 - from related, 5 - from unrelated, 3 - from haploidentical donors). Twenty one pts received BiTE\u00ae due to relapse after allo-HSCT (6 - from related, 12 - from unrelated, 3 - from haploidentical donors). Six pts received 2nd allo-HSCT after BiTE\u00ae therapy. In 10 pts with posttransplant relapse donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) was used in combination with BiTE\u00ae. Every patient received from 1 to 7 cycles (median 2) of BiTE\u00ae. Results. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 31/52 (60%) pts: in 18/31 (58%) pts with ALL relapse after CT, in 13/21 (62%) pts - after allo-HSCT. In 22/31 (71%) pts with CR after BiTE\u00ae therapy minimal residual disease was negative. Pts with less than 50% blasts in bone-marrow at baseline experienced substantially higher response rates compared with patients with 50% blasts or higher (70% (19/27) vs 48% (12/25)). Response rates were similar although the number of relapse - 58% (11/19) in 1 st relapse, 59% (10/17) in 2 nd relapse and 60% (9/15) in 3 d relapse. Pts with posttransplant ALL relapse who received BiTE\u00ae in combination with DLI had higher response rate than pts, who received BiTE\u00ae as monotherapy: 70% (7/10) vs 54% (6/11) respectively. One-year OS was 50% (95% CI 25-75%). One-year DFS was 42% (95% CI 18-66%). Grade \u22653 hematological toxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) was observed in 14 (27%) pts, grade \u22653 liver toxicity - in 6 (12%) pts. Ten pts (19%) developed toxic neuropathy during the therapy. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 5 (9%) pts. One pts after allo-HSCT (but not after DLI) developed grade I aGVHD. One pts after allo-HSCT developed grade II aGVHD after BiTE\u00ae in combination with DLI. There were no fatal treatment related toxicity. Nine (29%) pts who responded to BiTE\u00ae had relapse, 6 of them bone marrow and 3 extramedullary sites. Nine (29%) pts died: 5 pts - due to R/R ALL, 2 pts due to infection, 1 case of transplant related mortality and 1 pts due to second solid tumor (synovial sarcoma). Conclusion. The treatment of R/R ALL with BiTE\u00ae is effective and has acceptable toxicity. We demonstrated high efficacy in therapy of posttransplant ALL relapses, especially when BiTE\u00ae was combined with DLI, perhaps, due to additional immunological effect of the transplant.
