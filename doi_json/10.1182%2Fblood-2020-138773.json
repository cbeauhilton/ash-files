    "abstract_text": "Background: Detection of measurable residual disease (MRD) has been shown to provide important prognostic information in patients (pt) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) receiving standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. The predictive value of MRD detection after low intensity regimens is less well established. Methods: We conducted a post-hoc analysis of a phase 2 trial to determine the prognostic value of MRD after frontline therapy with venetoclax (VEN) plus decitabine (DEC; DiNardo CD, et al, Lancet Haematology, 2020 ). MRD was assessed on bone marrow (BM) specimens using 8-color multiparametric flow cytometry (FCM) that was validated to a sensitivity level of 0.01-0.1%. Negative results were considered valid only if there had been acquisition of at least 200,000 events or a minimum of 200 CD34+ myeloid precursors. Pts were treated with DEC 20 mg/m 2 for 10 days for induction followed by DEC for 5 days after CR/CRi with cycles repeated every 4-6 wks. Response and relapse were defined using the ELN 2017 criteria. Overall survival (OS) was determined from start of treatment until death or censored at last follow-up (LFU). Relapse-free survival (RFS) was determined from date of CR/CRi till morphologic relapse, death, or censored at LFU. Results: Between January 2018 and April 2020 we enrolled 121 pts in the frontline cohort including de novo AML (n=74), untreated secondary AML (sAML, n=16) and sAML with prior therapy for antecedent hematological disorder (n=31). No pts had received prior therapy for AML. The median age was 72 yrs (interquartile range [IQR] 68-77) and 34 pts (28%) had ECOG PS \u22652 ( Table 1 ). The overall response rate was 81% with CR/CRi rate of 71%. Over half (53%) of responding pts achieved MRD negative status at any time point. ( Table 2 ). The median time to response was 1.4 mo (IQR 1.1-2.6) and median time to MRD negativity was 2.0 mo (IQR 0.9-3.1). 16 pts (13%) underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant after achievement of response. The median OS was 11.7 mo (95% CI 9.1, 14.8) and the median RFS was 9.0 mo (95% CI 6.7, 15.0). After a median FU of 20.2 mo (95% CI 15.7, 23.0) 51 pts are alive. Pts achieving negative MRD at the time of morphologic response (CR/CRi/MLFS) had significantly longer OS compared to pts who were MRD positive, median OS 25.1 vs 11.6 mo, respectively, hazard ratio (HR) 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24, 0.85, p=.02. Pts achieving CR MRD- per ELN guidelines at any time point had longer OS compared to those with an inferior response i.e. CR MRD+ or CRi/MLFS MRD\u00b1 (median OS 25.1 mo vs 10.9 mo, HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.18, 0.55, p<.001; Fig. 1a ) and better RFS (median not reached [NR] vs. 6.7, HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14, 0.47, p<.001). Pts achieving any response who became MRD negative by 1 mo after starting therapy had a 85% reduction in risk of death compared to pts who achieved a response but remained MRD positive, median OS 25.1 vs 3.4 mo, respectively, HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03, 0.63, p<.001 ( Fig. 1b ). Pts achieving any response who became MRD negative by 2 mo after starting therapy also had a significantly improved OS compared to those who remained MRD positive (median OS of 25.1 mo vs. 8.0 mo, HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.12, 0.47, p<.001; Fig. 1c ) and RFS (median RFS NR vs 6.7 mo, HR 0.28, 95% Ci 0.13, 0.60, p<.001). Conclusion: Achievement of negative MRD status at 1- and 2-month time points is associated with significantly better OS and RFS in older pts with AML receiving frontline therapy with VEN and DEC.
