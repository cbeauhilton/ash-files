    "abstract_text": "Several diseases, such as \u03b2-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, are characterized by iron overload and dysfunction erythropoiesis. Multiple retrospective studies suggest that iron overload is associated with increased disease burden and shortened survival in patients. It is general consensus that iron overload has an inhibitory effect on erythroid differentiation, but direct evidence is lacking and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are incompletely understood. Excess iron is associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that result in cellular damage. We hypothesized that iron overload leads to the stimulation of myelosuppressive pathways that result in decreased erythropoiesis and resulting cytopenias. We first evaluated the effect of exogenous iron on the growth of primary human CD34+ stem cells and demonstrated that iron overload leads to decreased erythroid colony formation in vitro . Furthermore, in our in vivo experiments, we administered a total of 130 mg iron dextran IP over 20 days to C57BL/6 mice and compared these mice with PBS injected age and gender matched controls (n=5/group). We demonstrate that iron injection results in fewer circulating reticulocytes (200 vs. 310 x 10 9 cells/L; P=0.001) and hemoglobin (13.8 vs. 15 g/dL; P=0.0004). Using anti-CD44 and TER119 as flow cytometric markers, our data reveals a reduction in bone marrow erythroid burden (total erythroid precursors 9.6 vs. 15.3% in controls; P=0.04) with a disproportionately greater effect on orthochromatophilic erythroblasts (4.4 vs. 6.9%; P=0.02). As expected, bone marrow-derived erythroid precursors from iron loaded mice have more ROS (MFI 1497 vs. 958; P=0.05) as measured by flow cytometry, again with a disproportionately greater effect on orthochromatophilic erythroblasts (MFI 671 vs. 403; P=0.01). No effect on cell cycle was observed. To evaluate the mechanism behind iron induced suppression of erythropoiesis, we conducted a functional screen with variety of cytokine inhibitors. We observed that a specific inhibitor of the TGF\u03b2 receptor I kinase led to reversal of iron induced suppression of erythroid colonies from primary CD34+ cells in vitro . The ability of TGF\u03b2 kinase inhibitor, LY-215, in reversing iron mediated suppression was confirmed in variety of hematopoietic cell lines, resulting in the inhibition of iron induced apoptosis in these cells. Taken together, our data demonstrates for the first time that iron overload has direct suppressive effects on erythropoiesis. These effects are reversed by specific inhibitors of the TGF\u03b2 receptor I kinase and thus provide a preclinical rationale for these inhibitors in anemias associated with iron overload.
