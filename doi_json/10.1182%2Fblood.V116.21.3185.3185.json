    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3185 Introduction: Lupus anticoagulant (LA) is one of the laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. To detect the presence of LA, ISTH recommends performing two assays based on different principles. Our LA profile includes dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) and two different activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) reagents. The aim of the study was to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of aPTT and dRVVT in women with a history of pre-eclampsia, intra-uterine growth restriction, early recurrent abortion, late fetal loss and placental abruption collectively termed \u201cplacenta mediated complications\u201d. Materials and Methods: We studied a total of 247 patients and 287 samples in a 10 months period. Based on consensus criteria, samples were retested within a period of three months. 62/247 plasmas samples were collected during pregnancy. Laboratory studies: Screening tests: aPTT was performed using PTT-LA (Stago) and an aPTT home made reagent with diluted cephalin. dRVVT was performed using Russel viper venom RVV (Stago) and diluted cephalin. Negative control plasma was prepared according to ISTH LA recommendations for the mixing tests. Confirmatory tests: We performed a home made reagent for platelet neutralization procedure (PNP)-aPTT and dRVVT; Rosner Index and % of Correction as criteria for mixing and confirmatory tests interpretation. Statistical evaluation was performed by ROC method using EP Evaluator 9.9 software. Results: 172/287 samples (59.9%) were negative, while 115/287 samples (40.1%) were positive for LA. 44/115 samples (38.26%) were positive for both tests (aPTT and dRVVT), 60/115 samples (52.17 %) were positive only for dRVVT and 11/115 samples (9.57%) were positive only for aPTT. LA was confirmed in 9/62 pregnant women samples (14.5 %). 7 (11.3%) had abnormal dRVVT, the remaining 2 samples were positive for both tests. Table for PP\u2013  Assay . (UCA)/Cut off .
