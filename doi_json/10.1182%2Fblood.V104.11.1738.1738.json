    "abstract_text": "The role of the C1 domain in function of factor VIII has not been clearly defined. In contrast, functional interactions have been identified for the three A domains and the C2 domain. We hypothesized that the C1 domain of factor VIII participates in both phospholipid binding and interaction with factor X and/or factor IXa. We evaluated inhibition of the factor Xase complex by LE2E9, a human inhibitor IgG4k mAb against C1. We utilized altered catalytic activity of the factor Xase complex in a defined assay to report the inhibition by LE2E9. Inhibition by LE2E9 was also evaluated when soluble phosphatidylserine replaced vesicles to support the factor Xase complex and when Gla-domainless factor X was the substrate. The deglycosylated form of LE2E9 was also evaluated to better define the mechanism through which LE2E9 exerts its effect. We found that LE2E9 bound to factor VIIIa with an apparent KD of 0.5 nM. The apparent affinity of factor VIIIa for sonicated phospholipid vesicles of phosphatidylserine:phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylcholine 4:20:76 increased 3-fold in the presence of LE2E9. The apparent affinity of factor VIIIa for factor IXa was not significantly changed. The KM of the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex was 20 \u00b1 2 nM with LE2E9 vs. 40 \u00b1 2 nM without. LE2E9 decreased the Vmax by 77 \u00b1 6% indicating that the affinity of factor X for the factor Xase complex is increased while the rate of cleavage is decreased. When Gla-domainless factor X was used as the substrate for the factor Xase complex, LE2E9 did not inhibit activity indicating that inhibition occurs via an interaction that involves the factor X Gla domain. When the factor VIIIa-factor IX complex was supported by dihexanoyl phosphatidylserine rather than phospholipid vesicles the inhibition of Vmax was 47% indicating that the inhibitory effect does not require a phospholipid bilayer. Deglycosylated LE2E9 did not significantly change the KM but decreased the Vmax by 22% while both antibodies bound to factor VIII with the same affinity. These results suggest that LE2E9 inhibition relates largely to interaction of a carbohydrate moiety with factor VIII or factor X rather than binding the core C1 epitope. We conclude that LE2E9 decreases the KM, and the Vmax for the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex, but only when the factor X Gla domain is present. These results suggest that in the factor Xase complex the C1 domain of factor VIII is intimately associated with the Gla domain of factor X and that interaction between these domains enhances the kcat for the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex.",
