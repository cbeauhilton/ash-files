    "abstract_text": "Introduction : There are few effective treatment options available for patients (pts) with myelofibrosis (MF). Pts with thrombocytopenia, a risk factor for shorter overall survival, have poorer prognosis (Gangat, J Clin Oncol 2010). Pacritinib is a kinase inhibitor with specificity for JAK2, FLT3, IRAK1, and CFSR1 and has demonstrated minimal myelosuppression in clinical trials (Hart, Leukemia 2011; Komrokji, Blood 2015; Mesa, ASCO 2015). In the phase III open-label PERSIST-1 trial, a significantly greater proportion of pts treated with pacritinib achieved spleen volume reductions (SVR) \u226535% vs BAT (ITT: 19.1% vs 4.7%, p=0.0003; pts evaluable at baseline and Week 24: 25.0% vs 5.9%, p=0.0001; Mesa, ASCO 2015). This analysis examines pt responses across subgroups. Methods : Pts naive to treatment with JAK inhibitors were randomized 2:1 to receive oral pacritinib 400 mg once daily or BAT. Stratification factors included DIPSS risk status and baseline platelet count. Pts were eligible who had DIPSS Intermediate (Int)-1, Int-2, or High risk disease; absolute neutrophil count >500/\u00b5L; palpable splenomegaly \u22655 cm; and baseline Total Symptom Score (TSS) \u226513 using the Modified MPN Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom Score (MPN-SAF TSS and TSS 2.0). There was no restriction on baseline platelets or hemoglobin (Hgb) levels. The primary endpoint was the proportion of pts achieving SVR \u226535% at Week 24 by centrally-reviewed MRI or CT and the secondary endpoint was the proportion of pts achieving \u226550% reduction in TSS from baseline at Week 24 using 6 symptoms from the MPN-SAF TSS. Pt responses were analyzed by baseline risk factors for MF including platelet counts (<50,000/\u00b5L vs \u2265 50,000/\u00b5L and <100,000/\u00b5L vs \u2265100,000/\u00b5L), sex, age (\u226565 y vs <65 y), JAK2 V617F mutation status (positive vs negative), baseline MF diagnosis (primary MF [PMF] vs secondary MF), reticulin and collagen fibrosis staging (> 1 vs \u22641), TSS (\u226520 vs 25\u00d710 9 /L vs \u226425\u00d710 9 /L), peripheral blasts (\u22655% vs 3 vs \u22643). In multivariate logistic regressions, the odds of SVR \u226535% and TSS reduction \u226550% at Week 24 were modeled as a function of prognostic factors for MF and adjusted for treatment (pacritinib vs BAT). Results for the 6 symptoms common to both TSS versions are reported. Results : 327 pts were enrolled and randomized (pacritinib: 220, BAT: 107). Overall, 62% of pts had PMF; 32% had baseline platelets <100,000/\u00b5L and 16% had <50,000/\u00b5L; 75% were positive for JAK2 V617F . After a median follow-up of 8.4 months, treatment with pacritinib resulted in consistent rates of SVR across subgroups (Figure 1). When comparing vs BAT, the greatest differences in SVR \u226535% rates between treatment arms were observed in pts with baseline platelets <50,000/\u03bcL (+22.9% vs BAT), JAK 2V617F -negative pts (+23.0% vs BAT) and those aged 3 (OR=0.35, p=0.004). Conclusions : Treatment with pacritinib resulted in consistent rates of SVR \u226535% and TSS reduction \u226550% irrespective of baseline characteristics. Comparisons vs BAT were favorable for all patient subpopulations examined for both endpoints. These results support the use of pacritinib across all intermediate- or high risk MF pt subgroups analyzed. Figure 1.
