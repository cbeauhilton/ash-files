    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2454 Poster Board II-431 Donor T cells specific for minor histocompatibility antigens (mHags) contribute to graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) reactivity and graft versus host disease (GvHD) following HLA-matched stem cell transplantation. Hematopoiesis-restricted mHags may give rise to a more specific GvL effect without GvHD, whereas ubiquitously expressed mHags can be targets for both GvHD and GvL. Interestingly, high frequencies of circulating T cells specific for ubiquitously expressed mHags (e.g. male-specific epitopes, LB-ADIR-1F) have been detected in patients showing strong GvL with no or limited GvHD. Although both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells express the proteins encoding these mHags, the immune effector response in these patients appears to be skewed towards hematopoietic cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that non-hematopoietic tissues are relatively unsusceptible to the cytotoxic effect of these mHag-specific T cells. To test this hypothesis, we developed an in vitro system in which HLA-A2 + , ADIR + primary human fibroblasts were exposed to mHag LB-ADIR-1F or allo-A2 specific CD8 + T cells. ADIR + EBV-LCL were used as a control for hematopoietic cells. CTL-mediated cytotoxicity was measured using 4, 8 and 20 hours chromium release assays. Whereas all EBV-LCL were killed within 4 hours, 10% lysis of fibroblasts was found after 4 hours, only gradually increasing to 70% lysis after 20 hours in the continuous presence of the CTLs at 10/1 effector/target (E/T) ratios. To analyze whether this inefficient killing was due to low antigen expression by the human primary fibroblasts, we examined cytotoxicity against targets loaded with increasing concentrations of ADIR-peptide. Exogenous loading of fibroblasts with saturating concentrations (10 -6 M) of ADIR-peptide did not increase the sensitivity to T cell mediated cell death. To exclude that the observed inferior cell killing was due to the number of T cells available for engaging the fibroblasts, E/T ratios were increased to >100/1, but this did not change the poor susceptibility of the fibroblasts to CTL-mediated killing. Since apparently inefficient elimination of non-hematopoietic targets was found despite proper expression of the relevant antigen and the presence of functional T cells, we investigated whether insufficient engagement of T cells during contact with the fibroblasts was the cause of the impaired killing. To analyze this, kinetics of T cell degranulation upon target encounter was measured by CD107a, perforin and granzyme B expression. Although the onset of T cell activation was already seen after 2 hours, stimulation with fibroblasts resulted in degranulation in only a proportion of the T cells (50-60%) after 4hrs, resulting in full activation only after prolonged co-culture. In contrast, stimulation with EBV-LCL resulted in rapid, complete, and profound degranulation (100% of T cells within 2hrs). In concordance with this, T cell activation, as measured by the production of interferon gamma (IFNg) after stimulation with the fibroblasts, was suboptimal as compared to stimulation with EBV-LCL. These data suggest formation of an initial low avidity interaction with fibroblasts under steady state conditions, possibly only leading to efficient T cell engagement and fibroblast killing after a prolonged period of co-culture, resulting in the formation of a local pro-inflammatory environment. To confirm whether susceptibility to mHag-specific T cells was increased under pro-inflammatory conditions, we pre-treated fibroblasts with IFNg. Analysis of the expression of a panel of known adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules revealed that IFNg treatment resulted in a 2-5 fold upregulation of expression of HLA class I, HLA class II and ICAM-1, leading to a more uniform and profound T cell activation. This increased T cell activation resulted in more efficient direct fibroblast killing. In conclusion, despite proper expression of the relevant target antigens, low-avidity interaction between effector T cells and non-hematopoietic tissues results in minimal damage under non-inflammatory conditions.
