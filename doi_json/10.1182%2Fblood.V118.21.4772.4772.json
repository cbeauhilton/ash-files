    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4772 Background aHUS is a rare, genetic, life-threatening, disease caused by chronic uncontrolled complement activation, which leads to systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Despite plasma exchange/infusion (PE/PI), >50% of patients (pts) will either die, require kidney dialysis or have permanent renal damage within the first year of diagnosis. In addition to causing progressive organ damage, the uncontrolled complement activation and subsequent TMA might be expected to impact HRQoL. In 2 prospective, controlled, single-arm phase II trials of aHUS pts receiving ECU, a terminal complement inhibitor, TMA was stopped, there was no longer a need for PE/PI or new dialysis. In one of the trials (C08-002), dramatically, 4/5 pts on dialysis permanently discontinued dialysis as of most recent follow-up. The current analysis evaluates the impact of ECU on HRQoL in aHUS pts. Methods In trial C08-002, 17 pts with aHUS resistant to PE/PI (persistent TMA despite \u22654 PE/PI sessions 1 wk before screening) received ECU. In trial C08-003, 20 pts previously received chronic PE/PI (\u22651 every 2 wks and 0.06 is considered a clinically meaningful change Results C08-002: 15/17 pts received ECU until Wk 26 (2 discontinued at Wks 1 and 6; protocol violation and an adverse event unrelated to ECU, respectively) and 13 continued into the extension study. Median age=28 yrs and 29% were on dialysis immediately prior to ECU. Median time from diagnosis to screening =10 mo. All patients had eGFR \u226460 mL/min/1.73m 2 . C08-003: 20 pts received ECU for 26 wks and 19 continued into the extension study. Median age=28 yrs. Median time from diagnosis to screening=48 mo. Median duration of eGFR \u226460 mL/min/1.73m 2 =180 days at baseline. HRQoL: In both cohorts of distinct trial pts, ECU substantially improved HRQoL through Wk 26, and sustained this thereafter during long-term ECU therapy ( table ). In trial C08-002, improvements were seen as early as Day 7 (0.12, p=0.0346). Point estimate improvement (95%CI) in HRQoL from baseline to1 yr was 0.32 (0.27-0.36) for C08-002 and 0.09 (0.05-0.14) for C08-003. On an individual pt basis, 87% and 73% of C08-002 and C08-003 pts, respectively, achieved a clinically meaningful change that represented a clinically important large or moderate improvement in HRQoL measures, respectively. Conclusions aHUS pts have an impaired HRQoL both from a direct impact of aHUS morbidity and management requirements (such as PE/PI), but also from the systemic nature of the disease. In patients with aHUS, significant improvements in HRQoL were achieved rapidly with ECU (as early as Day 7). Sustained long-term treatment with ECU maintained the improvements in HRQoL.  .
