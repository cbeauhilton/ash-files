    "abstract_text": "Acute light chain induced renal failure (ARF) is a severe complication of progressive MM, leading to permanent renal dysfunction and dependence on chronic hemodialysis in a substantial proportion of patients (pts). Reversal of kidney failure can only be achieved by fast and substantial suppression of pathogenic light-chains with effective anti-MM therapy. Bortezomib in combination with doxorubicin and dexamethasone has been shown to be highly effective in newly diagnosed pts. In addition, bortezomib is well tolerated in pts with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and its half life is independent of renal function. In this study we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the BDD regimen in restoring renal function and in achieving tumor control in pts with light chain-induced renal failure. Up to now 67 of 70 planned pts have been enrolled. Documentation is available for 55 pts for intent to treat analysis and for 47 evaluable for renal and tumor response (age: median 66 years, range 41\u201379 years, ISS stage I: 2%, II: 13%, III: 85%. 37 (79%) of pts presented with de novo MM, and 10 (21%) with progressive disease; baseline median GFR 19.8 ml/min (range 3.7\u201349.9ml/min). ARF was defined in newly diagnosed pts as reduction of GFR to 25% to <50ml/min. Treatment regimen: Bortezomib (1.3mg/m 2 , d 1, 4, 8, 11 until the first safety analysis; thereafter 1.0mg/m 2 d 1, 4, 8, 11), doxorubicin (9mg/m 2 , d 1, 4, 8, 11 until first safety analysis; thereafter 9mg/m 2 , d 1 and 4) and dexamethasone 40mg (d 1, 4, 8, 11). Cycles were repeated every 21 days. 47 pts have completed at least 2 cycles and are evaluable for response as yet. 23 pts achieved CR/nCR (50%), 3 (6%) VGPR, 6 (13%) PR and 5 (11%) MR (CR-MR: 90%). Median time to response was 108 days. Median GFR increased from 19.8 ml/min (range: 3.7 \u2013 49.9 ml/min) to 46.1ml/min (range 6.7 \u2013 106 ml/min). Improvement of GFR correlated weakly with tumor response. In 26 pts with CR/nCR/VGPR, median GFR increased to 62 ml/min (10\u2013106 ml/min). Best median GFR was 25 ml/min (11 \u2013 106 ml/min) in 11 pts with PR/MR, and 22 ml/min (7 \u2013 51 ml/min) in 10 pts with SD/PD. When renal response was defined either as complete (CR renal : GFR\u226560 ml/min), partial (PR renal : increase from GFR <15 ml/min to 30\u201359 ml/min), or minor (MR renal : increase in GFR either from < 15 ml/min to 15\u201329 ml/min or from 15\u201329 ml/min to 30\u201359 ml/min), a total of 15 (32%), and 14 (30%) pts achieved a CR renal , or a PR/MR renal , respectively, yielding an ORR renal in 29 (62%) of pts (Table 1). Three of 8 dialysis dependent pts became dialysis independent. Table 1  Stage of renal failure at baseline (GFR) . Number of pts . Best renal response (number of pts, percentage) . . . CR renal .

OS was 76% @ 2 years in pts without CR renal , and 86% in pts with CR renal . Leucopenia, thrombopenia, and anemia of grade 3&4 were seen in 15%, 6% and 6%, respectively. Other common grade 3&4 toxicities were infection (4%), nausea/vomiting (6%), weakness/fatigue (11%) and polyneuropathy (8%). In conclusion, the BDD regimen resulted in high tumor (CR/VGPR 56%, ORR: 90%) and renal response rates (CR renal 32%, ORR renal 62%). Improvement of renal function was more often seen in pts with significant tumor response and CR renal was more likely in pts with less severe renal impairment. Treatment was well tolerated after dose adjustment."
