    "abstract_text": "Hyperdiploid (>48 chromosomes) multiple myeloma (H-MM) and high hyperdiploid (>50 chromosomes) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (H-ALL) are characterized by aneuploidy and multiple recurrent trisomies (chromosome 3,5,7,9,11,15,19 for H-MM and chromosomes X,4,6,10,14,17,18,21 for H-ALL). Little is known about the oncogenic events, consequences of the trisomies and reasons for the different recurrent trisomies. In an attempt to answer these questions, we undertook a combined gene expression and network/pathway analysis approach. Gene expression data was generated using the Affymetrix U133A chip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Ca) for 53 H-MM and 37 non-hyperdiploid MM (NH-MM) cases using CD138-enriched plasma-cell RNA. Gene expression data using the same chip for ALL was obtained from previous published data ( Ross ME et al Blood  2004 ; 104 : 3679 \u20133687 ). Analysis was performed using Genespring 7 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). By comparing the median expression of all genes on each chromosome between H-MM/H-ALL and their non-hyperdiploid counterparts (NH-MM and NH-ALL) for the 23 chromosomes (excluding Y), one can clearly identify the commonly trisomic chromosomes in H-ALL and H-MM. However, the relationship of gene expression was highly variable for H-MM and NH-MM as compared to H-ALL and NH-ALL which tended to have expression ratios close to 1 for the non-trisomic chromosomes. Sixty-nine percent of the differentially expressed genes generated by ANOVA analysis (p<0.001) in H-ALL were on the commonly trisomic chromosomes and were upregulated whereas the corresponding figure in H-MM is 40%. These similarities and differences probably reflect both an overall gene dosage effect and the different complexities of the karyotypes of H-MM and H-ALL compared to NH-MM and NH-ALL respectively (MM karyotypes are more complex, hence difference between H and NH-MM is greater and less confined to the trisomic chromosomes). We next performed network analysis using a curated web-based software (MetaCore, GeneGo Inc, St Joseph, MI) using the 2 sets of differentially expressed genes. Majority of genes differentially expressed in H-MM are involved in mRNA translation/protein synthesis whereas the genes differentially expressed in H-ALL were mainly involved in signal transduction. Therefore the transcriptional program that characterize the difference between H and NH-MM/ALL seem to recapitulate normal cellular function: protein synthesis in the mature secretory plasma cells and signal transduction in response to cytokines in a differentiating early-B cell. However, due to the concurrent deregulation of many genes on these trisomic chromosomes, these and other cellular programs are deregulated resulting in malignant transformation. We also intersected the 2 lists of differentially expressed genes to find genes that are up- or downregulated in both H-MM and H-ALL relative to the NH tumors. Thirteen genes including interferon response genes ( TNFSF10, MX1, ZNF185 ) and transcription factors like RUNX1 were upregulated, whereas 13 genes including a cancer testis antigen gene ( MAGED4 ) were downregulated in both H-MM and H-ALL. These genes may point to common oncogenic mechanisms.",
