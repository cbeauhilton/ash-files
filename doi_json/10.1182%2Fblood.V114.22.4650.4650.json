    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4650 Introduction MVA is one of the most promising vaccine candidates for infectious diseases as well as for malignancies. Astonishingly, little information exists about the mechanism by which immune responses to MVA are generated. It was shown that among leukocytes - which are essential for the generation of cellular and humoral immune responses - APCs like dendritic cells, monocytes and B cells are preferentially infected. But little is known about the effects on APCs. Therefore we wanted to analyze in more detail the general effects of MVA infections on different immune cells. Methods Primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and isolated leukocyte populations in particular monocyte derived DCs, monocytes and B cells were infected with (wildtype) wtMVA or MVA-gfp (green fluorescent protein) to verify the infection. Subsequently changes in surface markers and cytokine expression were assessed. Results Among PBMCs and specific isolated leukocyte populations, monocytes, DCs and B cells were most susceptible to MVA infection. NK cells showed a lower and T cells a very low infection rate. Surprisingly, selected monocytes were less susceptible to MVA as compared to unselected ones. This phenomenon is due to phagocytosis of other infected PBMCs by monocytes. Furthermore we could show that MVA causes a downregulation of CD14 on iDCs and monocytes as well as of CD25, CD80, and CD86 on B cells. Furthermore, there was a slight downregulation of CD1a on iDCs and mDCs and of CD80 on iDCs. On the other hand MVA caused an upregulation of HLA-DR on monocytes and additionally a slight upregulation of CD40 on iDCs. Moreover, MVA evoked a slight upregulation of CD83 on iDCs but a slight downregulation on mDCs. Above all, we could demonstrate that MVA induces an upregulation of CXCL10 in iDCs, mDCs, monocytes, and B cells, and an upregulation of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-12p70 in iDCs, mDCs, and monocytes. In addition, we revealed a downregulation of CXCL8 in monocytes as well as of IL-\u03b2 in B cells. Conclusions These results suggest that MVA induces a Th1-polarized immune response in APCs. Thus, MVA seems to be an appropriate vaccine vector for antiviral immunotherapy of stem cell transplant recipients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
