    "abstract_text": "Previously, we demonstrated that activation of Notch receptors by culture of murine lin \u2212 Sca-1 + c-kit + (LSK) hematopoietic progenitors with the Notch ligand Delta1 ext-IgG , consisting of the extracellular domain of Delta1 fused to the Fc domain of human IgG, promoted early T cell differentiation and increased the number of progenitors capable of short-term lymphoid and myeloid reconstitution. Here we show accelerated thymic engraftment and T cell recovery after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in recipients of LSK cells cultured with Delta 1ext-IgG compared to recipients of non-cultured LSK cells or control human IgG-cultured LSK cells. Furthermore, data suggest that addition of Delta1 ext-IgG cultured LSK cells to non-cultured LSK cells have the potential to accelerated T cell recovery by the non-cultured LSK cells by facilitating thymic engraftment by the non-cultured LSK cells. 10 3 Ly5a LSK cells cultured with Delta1 ext-IgG for 21 days generated a 10 8 -fold increase in total number of cells compared to culture with control IgG. Lethally irradiated C57Bl/6 mice received 10 5 C57Bl/6 GFP + LSK cells alone or along with 10 3 Ly5a LSK cells or 10 6 Lya5a Delta1 ext-IgG -cultured cells or 10 6 Ly5a IgG cultured cells. We monitored egraftment by difference in CD45 as well as GFP. Mice were sacraficed and blood, bone marrow and thymus were harvested at 1,2,3 and 4 wks after HCT. At 3 wks after HCT, blood samples from recipients of Delta1 ext-IgG -cultured cells contained at least 4-fold higher total number of CD3 + cells compared to the other control groups (p<0.05). Furthermore, recipients of Delta1 ext-IgG -cultured cells contained at least 3-fold higher numbers of CD3 + cells derived from the GFP+ LSK cells compared to the other control groups (p<0.05). 1 wk after HCT, thymuses and BM from recipients of Delta1 ext-IgG -cultured cells showed at lest a 3- and 7-fold increase, respectively, in the number of GFP + cells compared to the other control groups (p<0.05and p<0.007). Previously, we have shown our system generates committed and non-committed T cell progenitors with enhanced T cell reconstitution potential. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of Delta1 ext-IgG -cultured LSK cells to a non-cultured LSK graft has the potential to facilitate BM and thymic engraftment of the non-cultured LSK cells. By using the GFP + LSK cells, we were able to demonstrate that the facilitation of early BM and thymic recovery was due to the increased engraftment/homing of the GFP + cells rather than autologous recovery of the host. Thus this report describes a novel and clinically feasible ex-vivo culture system using Delta1 for the generation of T cell progenitors as a means to accelerate initial T-cell recovery as well as facilitating BM and thymic engraftment after HCT."
