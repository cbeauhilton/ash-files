    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Preclinical data suggest that PD-1 and PD-L1/PD-L2 mediate immune evasion in CLL. However, clinical data (Ding, BLOOD 2017) demonstrate that pembrolizumab monotherapy (pembro) is ineffective in relapsed/refractory (r/r) CLL patients (pts) (ORR 0%, med PFS 2.4 months). Additional data with an anti-PD1 demonstrated a 90% failure rate in Richter's Transformation (RT) with a med 2-month OS (Rogers, BJH 2018). Combinations may represent the future of anti-PD-1 therapy in CLL/RT, especially in RT pts rel/ref to ibrutinib, where median OS is ~3.5 mos. We hypothesized synergistic activity with PD-1 + PI3K blockade. Umbralisib (UMB), is a highly-specific PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor with additional effects on casein kinase-1 epsilon (CK-1\u03b5), which may have an inhibitory effect on Treg function (Deng et al, 2016). We tested the safety and activity of UMB in combination with the anti-CD20 mAb ublituximab (UTX) and pembro in r/r CLL and RT - the first reported combination of a PD-1 inhibitor + PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor in this population. Methods: Ph I (3+3 design), multicenter study to assess the safety/efficacy of UMB + UTX + pembro in pts with r/r CLL and RT. Treatment for CLL pts involved three stages: Induction: UMB (800mg daily) and UTX (900mg 3 out of 4 wks) for the first two 28-day cycles. Consolidation: Pembro (dose level 1=100mg, dose level 2=200mg) was then initiated every 3 wks in combination with UMB and UTX (900mg week 2 of cycle 4 and 6) for cycles 3-6. Maintenance: Cycle > 6, UMB 800 mg daily until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable AE. For RT pts, all study drugs are started in cycle 1 with the following schedule: UMB 800 mg daily; UTX 900 mg cycle 1 (D1, 8, 15), D1 cycles 2-4, cycle 7 and q3 cycles thereafter; and pembro D3 of cycle 1 and D2 of cycles 2-4. The primary endpoint is safety of the triple combination with efficacy as a secondary endpoint. Response assessments for CLL, based on the iwCLL 2008 criteria, were performed after cycles 2, 6 and 12. RT response assessments (Cheson 2007) were completed at the end of cycles 2, 4 and every 3 cycles until month 12. Peripheral blood and/or bone marrow biopsy, enriched for mononuclear cells, were obtained for correlative analyses at screening, month 2 and 6. Results: Fourteen pts have been treated to date: 9 with CLL (3 at 100 mg pembro / 6 at 200 mg pembro) and 5 with RT (4 at 100 mg pembro / 1 at 200 mg). Baseline demographics were as follows: male/female (9/5), med age 71 yrs (range 60-81), med prior therapies 2 (1-8), 79% were refractory to immediate prior therapy. 10 pts had prior ibrutinib of which 9 were ibrutinib refractory. 64% of pts had at least 1 high risk genetic feature (del17p, del11q, TP53 mut, NOTCH1 mut or complex karyotype). AE's (all causality) were manageable. Grade 3/4 AE's occurring in \u2265 3 pts included neutropenia (n=6, 43%), ALT/AST increase (n=3, 21%) and hypophosphatemia (n=3, 21%). One DLT occurred in a CLL pt at 200 mg dose level (ALT/AST elevation) which trigged expansion to 6 pts. No additional DLTs were reported, and no MTD was achieved. No increase in expected grade \u2265 3 PI3K\u03b4-associated toxicities were noted (1 pneumonitis event, no colitis events). ORR was 89% for CLL pts with ORR of 75% in BTK refractory CLL pts (3/4). Notably 2/4 BTK refractory CLL pts achieved a response to UMB + UTX (U2) induction alone prior to the addition of pembro. 4/5 RT pts were eligible for efficacy evaluation with 50% ORR (2/4, CR). The 2 RT CRs were durable and are ongoing (15+ mos and 7+ mos); both pts were ibrutinib refractory and had 7 (including SCT) and 8 prior lines respectively, and one had failed CAR-T. With a med follow up of 15 mos, 10/14 (71%) remain progression free (range 3 - 44 mos, Fig 1), including one CLL pt who completed consolidation and has been off therapy for 27+ mos. Sequential sampling for correlative studies demonstrated modest changes in Tregs numbers (Fig 2). Conclusion : The triplet combination of umbralisib + ublituximab + pembro was well-tolerated. Responses were durable in BTK refractory, high risk pts, including two CR's in RT pts. In contrast to pembro monotherapy, data suggest that CLL/RT pts who achieve \u2265 PR with this checkpoint inhibitor-containing regimen can achieve durable responses. Correlative studies suggest that maintenance of Tregs may limit autoimmune sequelae. Enrollment is ongoing in both the CLL (BTK refractory only) and RT cohorts.
