    "abstract_text": "Using in vivo imaging and cell phenotype monitoring, we identified a previously uncharacterized Lineage-ROR\u03b3t + early hematopoietic cell population with multi-lineage potential infiltrating allograft, syngeneic and sham transplant sites. They are distinctly different from Th17 cells, TCR \u03b3\u03b4 T, and iNKT cells. Some Lineage-ROR\u03b3t + infiltrating cells are CD127 + or NKp46 + , and therefore, are likely group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s). ILC3 are known to have a powerful effect on the conduct of inflammation. Additionally, some of these Lineage-RORgt + cells express classical hematopoietic stem cells traits \"LSK\" (Lineage-Sca-1 + c-kit + ). The genetic ablation of ROR\u03b3t expression and treatment with alpha1 anti-trypsin (AAT), a treatment that reduces inflammation, also reduces infiltration by ROR\u03b3t + cells at the graft site. Taken together, these data suggest an important role for ROR\u03b3t + cells in the allograft response. Jiafan Liu and Zhenni Zhao are the co-first author for the abstract Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
