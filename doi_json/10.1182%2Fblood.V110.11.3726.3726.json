    "abstract_text": "We have used recombinant von Willebrand factor (VWF) fragments to investigate the influence of the flanking regions of the A1 domain on the interaction with platelet glycoprotein (GP)Ib\u03b1. One fragment, the r 1261\u20131874, represented mainly the A1A2A3 domains and the other, r 1238\u20131874, included the C-terminal region of the D3 domain. When immobilized onto a surface, the two fragments tethered platelets similarly at high shear rates. The two fragments bound identically to immobilized fixed platelets in a ristocetin-dependent and saturable manner. In the absence of ristocetin, the r 1261\u20131874 had a 50% of its GPIb-binding activity with the modulator while the r 1238\u20131874 only had < 5% binding activity. The r 1261\u20131874 fragment effectively inhibited both ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination and shear-induced platelet aggregation. In contrast, the r 1238\u20131874 failed to show an inhibitory capacity in the two assays, indicating a limited interaction with platelet GPIb\u03b1 in solution. We also analyzed the single bond lifetimes in a range of constant forces of GPIb\u03b1 with either the single A1 domain (a.a. 1238\u20131471) or the A1A2A3 fragment using atomic force microscopy (AFM). When the protein was directly adsorbed on a Petri dish, the GPIb\u03b1 bound with longer lifetimes to the A1A2A3 than the isolated A1 domain, suggesting that a conformational change in the A1 is influenced by the A2A3 domains. In conclusion, the C-terminal region of D3 domain (a.a.1238\u20131260) and the A2A3 domains negatively regulate the binding of the A1 domain to platelet GPIb\u03b1 in suspension. On the other hand, the A2A3 domains may have a positive influence on the bond formed between the GPIb\u03b1 and a surface-bound A1 domain."
