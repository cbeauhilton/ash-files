    "abstract_text": "Background: Venous stasis syndrome (VSS) is a relatively common long-term sequelae of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), although it frequently is noted in individuals with no prior history of DVT. Objective: To evaluate whether: (1) venous stasis syndrome (VSS) is associated with a prior history of DVT; (2a) venous outflow obstruction (VOO) and/or (2b) venous valvular incompetence (VVI) are associated with DVT; and (3) VSS is associated with VVI and/or VOO. Design: Case-control study nested within a population-based inception cohort study. Population: 230 residents of Olmstead County, MN (OCM) with a first lifetime VTE over the 25-year period, 1966 \u2013 1990 (cases), and 135 age, gender and year of incident VTE-matched OCM residents without prior history of VTE (controls). Measurements: Physical examination and patient questionnaire for symptoms or signs of VSS, and strain gauge outflow plethysmography, continuous wave venous Doppler ultrasound, and passive venous drainage and refill testing for VOO and VVI performed between 1996 \u2013 1998. Results: Of the 365 study participants, 43 (12%) had VOO, 136 (37%) had VVI, and 265 (73%) had VSS. In multivariate logistic regression analyses: (1) age at the follow-up visit [OR \u0394 per 10 years : 1.70 (1.41, 2.04)], prior DVT in the affected limb [OR: 4.03 (2.32, 7.01)], and presence of prior varicose veins [OR: 4.36 (1.84, 10.31)] were significantly associated with VSS; (2a) age at the follow-up visit [OR \u0394 per 10 years (95% CI): 1.84 (1.39, 2.44)] and prior DVT in the affected limb [OR: 5.01 (2.61, 9.63)] were significantly associated with VOO; (2b) prior DVT in the affected limb (OR: 3.91 (2.56, 5.97)], presence of prior varicose veins [OR: 2.19 (1.32, 3.63)] and symptoms of VSS prior to incident DVT [OR: 3.42 (1.46, 8.00)] significantly increased the odds for VVI; and (3) VOO (p=0.004) and VVI (p<0.0001) were highly associated with VSS. Having a DVT in the left leg was associated with a greater odds of developing VOO, VVI or VSS in that leg when compared to their association with right leg DVT (OR: 6.69 vs. 3.65; 4.82 vs. 3.09; 4.71 vs. 3.97, respectively). Interestingly, prior DVT in the opposite leg was associated with an increased odds of subsequent VVI [OR: 2.00 (1.28, 3.10) and VSS [OR: 2.20 (1.31, 3.70)], but not VOO, in the test leg. Conclusions: Prior DVT imparts an increased risk for subsequent VSS, likely due to VOO and/or VVI. The odds of VOO or VSS increases with age. Presence of varicose veins increases the odds for VVI and VSS. We speculate that the increased odds of left sided VOO, VVI and VSS in patients with prior DVT may be secondary to May-Thurner syndrome. The increased odds of VVI and VSS in the limb opposite to the one affected by prior DVT could reflect occult DVT in the test limb, inferior vena cava thrombosis, or other mechanisms leading for VVI and VSS.",
