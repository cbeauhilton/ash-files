    "abstract_text": "Background : To identify genes upregulated in human memory B and plasma cells, nai\u0308ve B cell cDNA was subtracted from plasma cell and memory B cell cDNA. One gene that was highly expressed in plasma cells encodes CS1 (CD2 subset 1, CRACC, SLAMF7), a cell surface glycoprotein of the CD2 family. CS1 was originally identified as a natural killer (NK) cell marker. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for CS1 were used to validate CS1 as a potential target for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Methods: Anti-CS1 mAbs were generated by immunizing mice with a protein comprising of the extracellular domain of CS1. Two clones, MuLuc63 and MuLuc90, were selected to characterize CS1 protein expression in normal and diseased tissues and blood. Fresh frozen tissue analysis was performed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Blood and bone marrow analysis was performed using flow cytometry with directly conjugated antibodies. HuLuc63, a novel humanized anti-CS1 mAb (derived from MuLuc63) was used for functional characterization in non-isotopic LDH-based antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays. Results : IHC analysis showed that anti-CS1 staining occurred only on mononuclear cells within tissues. The majority of the mononuclear cells were identified as tissue plasma cells by co-staining with anti-CD138 antibodies. No anti-CS1 staining was detected on the epithelia, smooth muscle cells or vessels of any normal tissues tested. Strong anti-CS1 staining was also observed on myeloma cells in 9 of 9 plasmacytomas tested. Flow cytometry analysis of whole blood from both normal healthy donors and MM patients showed specific anti-CS1 staining in a subset of leukocytes, consisting primarily of CD3 \u2212 CD(16+56) + NK cells, CD3 + CD(16+56) + NKT cells, and CD3 + CD8 + T cells. Flow cytometry of MM bone marrow showed a similar leukocyte subset staining pattern, except that strong staining was also observed on the majority of CD138 + CD45 \u2212/dim to + myeloma cells. No anti-CS1 binding was detected to hematopoietic CD34 + CD45 + stem cells. To test if antibodies towards CS1 may have anti-tumor cell activity in vitro, ADCC studies using effector cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) from 23 MM patients and L363 MM target cells were performed. The results showed that HuLuc63, a humanized form of MuLuc63, induced significant ADCC in a dose dependent manner. Conclusions: Our study identifies CS1 as an antigen that is uniformly expressed on normal and neoplastic plasma cells at high levels. The novel humanized anti-CS1 mAb, HuLuc63, exhibits significant ADCC using MM patient effector cells. These results demonstrate that HuLuc63 could be a potential new treatment for multiple myeloma. HuLuc63 will be entering a phase I clinical study for multiple myeloma."
