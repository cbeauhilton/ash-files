    "abstract_text": "The prognosis of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) relapsing following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is still dismal. Within the framework of the ALL-REZ BFM 2002/ALL-SZT BFM 2003 trials, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of ten patients relapsing after allo-SCT with the aim to thoroughly characterize the spectrum of acquired mutations and to identify potentially druggable targets, thus laying the ground for future personalized treatment strategies. Patients' age at initial diagnosis ranged from <12 months to 10 years. Two patients were diagnosed with T-ALL and 8 with pre-B-ALL. Time from initial disease to relapse ranged from 13 to 40 months. Patients underwent allo-SCT 3 to 6 months after diagnosis of relapse, donors were either HLA-matched unrelated volunteers (n=6), HLA-identical siblings (n=1) or HLA-haploidentical family donors (n=1). Time from SCT to relapse ranged from 3 to 21 months. Treatment following the post allo-SCT relapse varied considerably (from palliative care to a second allo-SCT). Only 2/10 patients are still alive, with one recently having been diagnosed with subsequent relapse following a second SCT. To investigate the mutational landscape of relapsed ALL following high-dose chemotherapeutic and immunologic attack both provided by an allo-SCT, five samples per patient were analyzed: initial leukemia (INIT), remission (REMI) after front-line chemotherapy representing patient germline, first relapse (RLPS), full donor-chimeric remission post allo-SCT (TREMI) representing donor germline, and relapse post allo-SCT (TRLPS). For comparative analyses, we defined the following three \"oncogenomes\" (OGs): OG1 (initial leukemia, SNVs in INIT minus REMI)), OG2 (first relapse, SNVs in RLPS minus REMI), OG3 (post allo-SCT relapse, SNVs in TRPLS minus REMI or TREMI). Median numbers of leukemia-specific SNVs in OG1-3 were 8.5, 34 and 37.5. We detected a median of 0.18 mutations per megabase (MB) in OG1, 0.67 mutations/MB in OG2 and 0.74 mutations/MB in OG3 (p= 0.005 for OG2/3 vs. OG1 [Wilcoxon test]). Although the mutational spectrum was highly diverse between individual patients and within the oncogenomes, we also identified several recurrent alterations: in OG1, five genes had recurrent SNVs (IGSF3, TTN, NOTCH1, CTBP2, NRAS). Seven genes were recurrently affected in three OG2s, including IKZF1, NOTCH1, NRAS, NT5C2. In OG3 we detected eleven recurrently mutated genes in three patients, among which were NRAS, FLT4, and TP53. Notably, TP53 was mutated in 5/10 patients. One patient carried a TP53 germline mutation, one patient had one unique SNV each in OG2 as well as OG3 and three patients had TP53 mutations only present in their OG3s. All but one SNV (resulting in a premature stop codon) were non-synonymously coding and were predicted to be deleterious for protein function. Of particular note, leukemic blasts showed profound plasticity concerning the mutational status of the nucleoside exporter NT5C2, mutations of which were previously shown to drive chemotherapy resistance in relapsed childhood ALL. While NT5C2 alterations were completely absent in OG1, 4 SNVs were detected in the OG2s of 3/10 patients. However, these NT5C2 mutations disappeared again in the OG3s once selection pressure of maintenance chemotherapy employing nucleoside analogues had been withdrawn. To identify novel treatment options in the desperate clinical scenario of post allo-SCT relapse, we searched OG3 for genetic lesions in genes known to be either targeted directly (a certain gene) or indirectly (a certain pathway) by currently approved therapeutic agents. To our surprise, nine out of ten patients exhibited such SNVs, for which additional targeted therapies are already available. Those therapeutic agents comprise small molecules inhibitors as well as antibodies such as Dasatinib, Erlotinib, Ibrutinib, Pazopanib, Tocilizumab, and Trastuzumab. Conclusion : Our comprehensive genetic analysis of ten children with ALL relapsing post allo-SCT revealed profound leukemic cell plasticity (e.g. loss of acquired NT5C2 mutations) as well as identified several recurrent genetic alterations (e.g. NOTCH1, NRAS, IKZF1) including TP53 (5/10 patients). Most importantly, we identified alterations in genes amenable to targeted treatment approaches in 9/10 patients thus potentially opening new therapeutic avenues.
