Rituximab plus chemotherapy for FL significantly improves the outcome of the patients, nevertheless, most patients ultimately relapse. Therefore, novel agents along with Rituximab have been applied to increase treatment efficacy in this subset of iNHL patients. Tumor immune eascape plays a crucial role in lymphoma progression. Through modulating tumor microenvironment, lenalidomide, are emerging as effective therapeutic approaches to affect tumor immunity and inhibit lymphoma cells proliferation. However, its anti-tumor activity activity has not yet been assessed in de-novo chinese FL patients. This prospective phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in combination with Rituximab (R2) in newly diagnosed FL patients (NCT 03715309). Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed FL (grade 1 to 3a), aged 16 to 75 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 are enrolled. The doses and administration schedule are as follows: rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 0, lenalidomide 25mg from day 1 to day 10 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. The primary endpoint is complete response (CR) rate assessed by PET-CT, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR) and main adverse events (AEs). Results: To date, eighty-six patients have been enrolled, with median age of 48 years (range, 22-73). At diagnosis, Seventy-seven patients (89.5%) presented advanced Ann Arbor stage and 19 cases (22.0%) showed elevated serum LDH level. Twenty-nine patients (33.7%) had multiple extra-nodal sites involving bone marrow, bone, gastrointestinal, and spleen. Twenty-one patients (24.4%) had IPI scores \u2265 3. For Sixty-four patients available for response evaluation, the CR rate was 81.2% (52/64) and the ORR was 90.1% (58/64). Grade 3-4 neutropenia was found in 18 cases (20.9%). No grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3-4 anemia were observed. For non-hematological AEs, cutaneous reactions and tumor flare reaction were observed in 12 cases (13.9%) and in 1 case (1.16%), respectively, while no grade 4 non-hematological AEs were presented. Conclusion: Lenalidomide Plus Rituximab as first-line therapy for de novo patients with FL showed encouraging response and good tolerability.
