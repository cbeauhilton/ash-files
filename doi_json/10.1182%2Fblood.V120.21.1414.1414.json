    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1414 Introduction: Studies of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults have documented that abnormalities of chromosome 5q (-5/5q-), primarily deletions, confer a poor prognosis. However, there are no large studies that specifically focus on -5/5q- in pediatric AML. Methods: To elucidate the disease correlates of this group, we retrospectively analyzed cytogenetic data from 5 studies of childhood AML: Children's Oncology Group (COG-AAML03P1), Children's Cancer Group (CCG-2961 and 2891) and Pediatric Oncology Group (POG-8821 and 9421). Data from all patients whose cytogenetic clones included -5/5q-, with the exception of those with acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3) or Down syndrome, were included. A total of 2035 patients from these 5 studies had cytogenetic data available for review. Results: Twenty-two (1.1%) of the 2035 patients had \u22125 or 5q-. The majority of these patients were male (63.6%). The median age was 12.9 years (range 0.3\u201320.7 years) with a significant number of patients in the 11\u201321 year age range (63.6%, p=0.032). The median white blood cell count was 17.4 \u00d710 3 /\u03bcL (range 1.4\u201398 \u00d710 3 /\u03bcL) and the median bone marrow blast percentage was 77% (range 15\u201399%). Patients with -5/5q- had a significantly higher median platelet count at diagnosis than those without this abnormality (88\u00d710 3 /\u03bcL versus 53\u00d710 3 /\u03bcL, p=0.015). Of the 22 patients with -5/5q-, their FAB classification showed that a significant number of patients had M0 morphology (28.6%, p0.1). Conclusions: In this, the largest retrospective study of pediatric patients with AML and -5/5q- to date, this cytogenetic subgroup was found to have a poor outcome. The median 5-year overall survival across studies was 32%, and the median 5-year event free survival was 27%. These findings support the use of more aggressive therapy for the treatment of children with -5/5q- AML, as has been previously supported based on data from adults with -5/5q- AML. This subset of patients may also benefit from treatment with innovative agents. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
