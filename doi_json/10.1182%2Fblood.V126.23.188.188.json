    "abstract_text": "Background: The murine (Mu) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 11-1F4 prepared against human light-chain-related fibrils recognizes an amyloid-associated conformational epitope when administered to mice bearing human AL amyloidomas and elicits a neutrophil/macrophage response that led to rapid and complete elimination of the amyloid tumors with no evidence of toxicity in the animals. PET/CT using I-124 labeled Mu mAb 11-1F4 revealed uptake by the organs known to contain amyloid in the majority of patients studied. 1,2 These results led to production of GMP-grade amyloid fibril-reactive chimeric (Ch) IgG1 mAb 11-1F4 by the NCI's Biological Resource Branch for a Phase I clinical trial in patients with AL amyloidosis. Methods: This is an open-label, dose-escalation Phase I clinical trial of Ch IgG1 mAb 11-1F4 in patients with relapsed or refractory AL amyloidosis. The trial was conducted under the auspices of an Experimental Therapeutic Investigational New Drug (IND) with a primary objective of defining the maximum tolerated dose, and tolerability and safety of Ch IgG1 mAb 11-1F4 when given as a single intravenous infusion. Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics, safety, and organ response. Patients were eligible if they had received prior systemic therapy for relapsed or refractory AL-Amyloidosis or had declined or were ineligible for standard systemic therapy and a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Patients were excluded if they had ventricular ejection fraction less than 40 percent, an interventricular septal thickness greater than 25mm, a history of sustained ventricular tachycardiac or cardiac arrest, 24 hour creatinine clearance of less than 30cc/min, alkaline phosphatase greater than three times the upper limit of normal, or total bilirubin greater than 3.0mg/dL. A dose-escalation \"up and down\" design was used with 7 sequential doses of 0.5, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250 and 500 mg/m 2 . Results: As of July 14, 2015, dose level 6 was completed including six patients who completed the study. Two patients had primarily cardiac, 2 patients primarily skin, and 2 primarily gastrointestinal (GI) involvement. All patients tolerated the dose received and no grade 3, 4 adverse events (AE) or deaths occurred. The AE included: dose level 5, one patient with grade 1 nausea and diarrhea and at dose level 4 one patient grade 2 rash for 11 days. Skin biopsy revealed previously undiagnosed cutaneous amyloid deposits and a neutrophilic infiltrate that may represent proof of antibody binding amyloid fibrils. Though the primary objective of the trial was to evaluate safety, 3 of 6 patient had evidence of organ response (2 cardiac and 1 GI) after only one infusion of Ch IgG1 mAb 11-1F4. Conclusions: To date, Ch IgG1 mAb 11-1F4 was well tolerated by all study subjects without any adverse reactions and promising organ response after completion of 6 dose levels. Development of an AL-fibril-specific mAb treatment would be an invaluable adjunct in the treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis and lead to improved medical management of this incurable and ultimately fatal disease.
