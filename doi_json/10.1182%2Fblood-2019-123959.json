    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited human hematologic disease, which causes hemolytic anemia, pain, disability, progressive multi-organ damage and early mortality. Clinical studies have shown that increased synthesis of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in sickled erythroid cells leads to diminished severity of many clinical features of SCD. Therefore, therapeutic agents that can increase HbF production will be of benefit to SCD patients. Hydroxyurea (HU) is a FDA-approved therapeutic for treatment of SCD, but not all patients respond favorably or adequately. Therefore, other methods of targeting HbF are highly desired, particularly those that act by different mechanisms that might be used in combination with HU or alone (for those who do not tolerate HU). Transcriptional co-activator PGC-1\u03b1 has recently been showed to play a crucial role in globin gene regulation and erythropoiesis by our group. Loss of function in the PGC-1\u03b1 knock out mice significantly reduced the expression of murine embryonic \u03b5y- and \u03b2h1-globin genes; both of them are homologues of the human \u03b5- and \u03b3-globin genes. Forced overexpression of PGC-1\u03b1 in vitro by adenovirus infection in bone marrow cells from SCD mice resulted in significantly increased human \u03b3- and murine \u03b5y- and \u03b2h1-globin genes. These results directly validate a role for PGC-1\u03b1 in human \u03b3-globin induction and provide significant support for the hypothesis that modulating PGC-1\u03b1 activity, or the signaling pathways that it regulates, in SCD patients may be an effective approach that could therapeutically benefit individuals with SCD. Here we report the effects of PGC-1\u03b1 in inducing HbF in human primary erythoid progenitor CD34 + cells. We infected CD34 + cells with lentivirus carrying PGC-1\u03b1 and found that over-expression of PGC-1\u03b1 resulted in significantly increased F-cells in the culture, from 1.6% up to 41.1%. We further discovered several PGC-1\u03b1 agonists that are highly selective for PGC-1\u03b1. We found that one of the PGC-1\u03b1 agonists, Compound SR-18292, induces PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA expression in a dose dependent manner (2.6-fold at 1 \u03bcM, 5.7-fold at 10 \u03bcM) in cultured CD34 + cells without effecting cell viability. Consistent with the increase of PGC-1\u03b1 levels, the percentage of F-cells increased from 2.76% (vehicle control) to 32.1% when cells exposed to 1 \u00b5M SR-18292, which is comparable to that of 25 \u00b5M HU (32.2%). The mean fluorescence intensity of F-cells in SR-18292 treated cells was higher than in controls, suggesting that the treatment not only increased the number of F-cells but also increased the concentration of HbF in F-cells. The increased levels of PGC-1\u03b1 reactivates the expression of fetal \u03b3-globin genes resulting in significant HbF accumulation in adult erythrocytes, suggesting that the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1\u03b1 comprises a new molecular target for possible therapeutic intervention in treating SCD.
