    "abstract_text": "Abstract 573 Using high throughput RNA interference screening on 6,722 druggable genes we previously identified XPO1/CRM1 as one of the 50 most vulnerable targets in Multiple Myeloma (MM) 1 . XPO1 knockdown proved lethal in MM cell lines, but had no effect on human embryonic kidney (293) cells or lung cancer (A549) cells, showing that XPO1 is a specific myeloma vulnerability, and that myeloma cell survival is dependent upon XPO1 expression. XPO1 encodes the protein exportin 1, a nuclear transport protein that exports tumor suppressor proteins from the nucleus, where they are active, to the cytoplasm, where they become inactive. We next analyzed XPO1 in MM via gene expression profiling (GEP). XPO1 expression is up-regulated as the disease progresses: patients with active MM have a higher level of XPO1 compared to normal plasma cells (p<0.04) and to patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or smoldering MM (p<0.0001). The highest levels were in human MM cell lines. TC classification revealed highest levels in t(11;14) and lowest levels in t(4;14) disease. Selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) compounds have recently been developed that irreversibly inhibit XPO1/CRM1 and its nuclear export function. One such inhibitor, KPT-276, decreased the viability of all 12 MM cell lines tested in vitro, as shown by MTT assay. After 72 hours of drug treatment, a median IC50 value of approximately 175 nM (range 30\u20131000 nM) was observed. No synergy with other commonly used anti-MM therapeutics was observed in vitro. In contrast, the drug had little effect in 8 solid tumor cell lines with the exception of the B cell lymphoma line Ramos. KPT-276 was also consistently active in inducing apoptosis against MM primary patient samples. Using an IC80 dose of KPT-276, drug-treated samples had a reduced population of cells in S phase (8%) compared to cells treated with DMSO (21%). Using the vkappa*myc transgenic MM model, KPT-276 reduced monoclonal spikes (by a mean of 56%) in all mice treated orally with 150 mg/kg dose three times per week for 4 weeks. Furthermore, KPT-276 significantly reduced tumor growth in a xenograft MM1.S mouse model. GEP was performed in the presence or absence of drug in two different MM cell lines. Two genes of probable relevance, cell division cycle 25 homolog A ( CDC25A ) and Bromodomain-containing protein 4 ( BRD4 ), were dysregulated by SINE treatment. Both are involved in cell cycle control and have been linked to MYC . RT-PCR and western blotting confirm that MYC, CDC25A and BRD4 are down-regulated, as soon as six hours, after treatment with KPT-276. KPT-276 has shown marked anticancer activities against B cell malignancies in vitro and is active and tolerated in Phase I canine studies. KPT-330, a close analog of KPT-276, is currently in Phase 1 studies in human with advanced hematological and solid tumors. Disclosures: Schmidt: Karyopharm: Research Funding.
