    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1387 miR-155 is upregulated in aggressive subtypes of solid tumors and leukemia. In AML, higher miR-155 expression is associated with FLT3 -ITD. However, whether miR-155 upregulation impacts on clinical outcome independently from FLT3 -ITD and other prognosticators is unknown. We evaluated the prognostic impact of miR-155 in 363 CN-AML pts (153 age <60 y; 210 age \u226560 y) that were treated with cytarabine-daunorubicin-based regimens and had a median follow-up of 7.9 y (range, 2.3\u201312.9). miR-155 levels were measured in pretreatment marrow or blood by the NanoString nCounter assay quantifying expression of the encoding gene MIR155HG ; other molecular markers were assessed centrally. High miR-155 expressers ( miR-155 ) had higher WBC ( P <.001) and were more often FLT3 -ITD-positive (pos; P <.001), RUNX1 -mutated (mut; <.001), WT1 -mut ( P =.03), \u2191 ERG ( P =.02) and \u2191 BAALC ( P =.002), and less often CEBPA -mut ( P =.003), IDH2 -mut ( P =.004) and FLT3 -TKD-pos ( P =.08) than low expressers (\u2193 miR-155 ). \u2191 miR-155 had lower CR rates ( P <.001), shorter DFS ( P =.001) and OS ( P <.001), than \u2193 miR-155 . In multivariable analyses (MVA; Table ), \u2191 miR-155 was associated with lower CR rates ( P =.007) and shorter OS ( P <.001). Among younger pts, \u2191 miR-155 had lower CR rates ( P =.03) and shorter DFS ( P <.001) and OS ( P <.001) than \u2193 miR-155 . In MVA ( Table ), \u2191 miR-155 status remained associated with worse CR rate ( P =.06), shorter DFS ( P =.003) and OS ( P =.01). Among older pts, \u2191 miR-155 had lower CR rates ( P =.008) and shorter OS ( P <.001); in MVA ( Table ), \u2191 miR-155 remained associated with worse CR ( P =.03) and shorter OS ( P =.05). In the European LeukemiaNet classification, younger \u2191 miR-155 in the Favorable (Fav) Genetic Group (GG; CEBPA -mut and/or NPM1 -mut without FLT3 -ITD) had lower CR rates ( P =.03) and shorter DFS ( P =.04) and OS ( P =.02) than \u2193 miR-155 . In the younger Intermediate-I (Int-I) GG pts (with wild-type CEBPA, NPM1 -mut with FLT3 -ITD, or wild-type NPM1 ), miR-155 expression did not impact independently on outcome. In older pts, \u2191 miR-155 had a shorter OS both in the Fav ( P =.06) and Int-I GGs ( P =.05) than \u2193 miR-155 . To gain biologic insights, w e derived an Affymetrix gene-expression signature that comprised 196 mRNAs significantly correlated with miR-155 expression. Consistent with previous mechanistic studies, Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the \u2191 miR-155 -associated signature was enriched for genes involved in anti-apoptotic, proliferative and inflammatory activities (FDR<0.05). \u2191 miR-155 was not significantly correlated with that of any other microRNAs (miRs) thereby supporting the unique role of miR-155 among the miRs in AML. In summary, miR-155 expression is independently associated with clinical outcome in CN-AML and may allow for better evaluation of molecular risk, especially in pts lacking FLT3 -ITD, like those in the ELN Fav GG. Moreover, given its role in deregulation of fundamental mechanisms of cell homeostasis and the emergence of miR inhibitors, miR-155 may become a novel therapeutic target. Table.
