    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Hsp70 was frequently found on the plasma membrane of bone marrow-derived leukemic blasts, but not on normal bone marrow cells. Hsp70 membrane expression could be correlated with protection against therapy-induced apoptosis (Nylandsted et al 2004). In contrast, these tumor cells have been found to be highly sensitive to the cytolytic attack mediated by NK cells. In vitro , Hsp70-activated NK cells efficiently lysed autologous Hsp70 membrane-positive leukemic blasts (Gehrmann et al 2003). Granzyme B release served as a surrogate marker for estimating the cytolytic response of NK cells against Hsp70 membrane-positive tumor target cells (Gross et al 2003). Here, we studied the development of NK and T cells in AML patients (n=6) after allogeneic SCT at different time points (days 14\u201320, 45, 90, 180, 1 year) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Methods: HLA class I, HLA-E and Hsp70 surface expression was determined on all patient-derived leukemic blasts of the bone marrow by flow cytometry. The amount of NK and T cells was investigated by multicolor flow cytometry using CD3/ CD16 and CD56 and CD94/ CD56 antibody-combinations detecting NK cell specific markers. Effector cell function was tested in a granzyme B ELISPOT assay against patient-derived leukemic blasts and K562 cells. Results: All tested leukemic blasts were positive for HLA class I, HLA-E, and Hsp70. After induction therapy the amount of CD3-negative, CD56/CD94-positive NK cells was 28\u00b116%, that of CD3-positive T cells was 58\u00b13%. On days 14\u201321 after allogeneic SCT, 58\u00b19% of the donor-derived peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were CD3-negative, CD56/CD94-positive NK cells; the amount of CD3-positive T cells was 26\u00b17.5%. On day 45, the amount of NK cells further increased up to 68\u00b17.9%; that of T cells further decreased down to 16\u00b15.6%. On day 90 and day 180 the amount of NK cells was still 41\u00b110%; that of T cells was 29\u00b112%. Interestingly, high NK cell counts correlated with an increased cytolytic response against leukemic blast and K562 cells. One year after allogeneic SCT, NK (20\u00b11%) and T cell (52\u00b118%) ratios were comparable to that of healthy human individuals. Conclusions : Between days 14 and 180 after allogeneic SCT, the amount of NK cells was significantly elevated if compared to that of T cells. Concomitantly, cytolytic function against leukemic blasts was significantly elevated. Normal levels, in the composition of NK and T cells were reached 1 year after SCT.
