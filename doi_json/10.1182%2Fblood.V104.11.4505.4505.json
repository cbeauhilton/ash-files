    "abstract_text": "Background As 2 O 3 , on the one hand is successful in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), on the other hand many side effects may occur during the early arsenic treatment. We assessed the effectiveness and security of two As 2 O 3 administration methods in acute promyelocytic leukaemia treatment. Methods seventy-four cases of APL treated using As 2 O 3 in two administration methods have been studied randomly. Thirty-two cases were administrated As 2 O 3 with routine method as control, the other 42 cases were given As 2 O 3 with a \u2018continuous and slowing intravenous infusion\u2019 method. Firstly, we calculated the total quantity of As 2 O 3 needed every day of every patient according to the criteria of 0.16mg/kg, then gave half of the total amount of As 2 O 3 in the morning and the other half in the afternoon, diluted each half of total amount of As 2 O 3 with 5% glucose 250ml and infused at the speed of 8 drops/min, collected the blood serums of the patients treated with the two methods respectively at different time points, and finally we assayed arsenic concentration in blood serums. Results Most of the APL treated by As 2 O 3 gained complete remission at the time of 4 th week with the two administrated methods. The total effective rate in \u2018continuous and slowing intravenous infusion \u2018 group was 93.75%, while that in control group was 83.3%. The effective arsenic level in blood circulation in \u2018continuous and slowing intravenous infusion\u2019 group was lasted at least 18.38\u00b13.27 hours, while in control group was lasted 9.38 \u00b11.58 hours, the average hospitalization duration in \u2018continuous and slowing intravenous infusion \u2018 group was26.4\u00b12.04 days, while that in control group was 35.7\u00b14.78 days. Conclusions The \u2018continuous and slowing intravenous infusion\u2019 method can relieve leukocytosis, increase complete remission (CR) rate of APL, and accelerate to CR.
