    "abstract_text": "Although the mortality of autologous stem cell transplantation in contrast to allogeneic is low, in AML patients the lack of immune surveillance as well as contamination of the transplant with residual leukemic stem cells (LSC) limits its use. Therefore, elimination of LSC by targeted therapy may represent a promising therapeutic approach. Recently, CD96 was identified as marker antigen on AML-LSC (Hosen et al., PNAS 104: 11008, 2007). Here, by addressing CD96 with magnetic cell sorting (MACS) or using antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), new strategies for engineering autologous stem cell grafts or for in vivo targeting of residual AML stem cells are presented. To evaluate the efficacy of depletion of LSC by MACS technology, grafts containing hematopoietic stem cells were spiked with CD96 positive AML cells. Using biotinylated CD96 antibody TH111 raised in our laboratory in combination with anti-biotin-micro beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) up to a 1000-fold depletion of targeted cells was achieved. The viability, cell count and the potential of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) to proliferate and differentiate were not affected by this procedure as documented by flow cytometry and colony forming assays. As residual LSC residing within the patient may also account for AML relapse after high-dose chemotherapy and subsequent SCT, eradication of AML stem cells in vivo is desirable. To target CD96 + AML-LSC by ADCC, chimeric antibodies containing wild type or affinity maturated variable regions in combination with an optimized human IgG 1 Fc were generated by recombinant DNA technologies. Both recombinant antibodies were expressed in Hek 293 cells enriched to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and analyzed for their functional properties. As shown by flow cytometry, the antigen binding affinity of the maturated antibody was enhanced (EC50 0.6 \u03bcg/ml vs. 2 \u03bcg/ml). Moreover, as analyzed in standard ADCC assays, NK cell mediated lytic properties against CD96-positive target cells were elevated (maximum lysis: 52%) using the affinity maturated chimeric CD96 antibody (EC50: 0.02 \u03bcg/ml vs. 0.15 \u03bcg/ml). Thus, this CD96 purging strategy avoids unwanted transplantation of AML-LSC and may help to revitalize autologous stem cell transplantation in this indication. Although, specific side effects by CD96 application will have to be considered, this may allow for an additional therapeutic avenue to eliminate in vivo residual AML-LSC in autologous as well as in allogeneic situations.
