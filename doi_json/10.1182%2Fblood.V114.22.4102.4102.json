    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4102 Background Previously we reported the result of Kyushu-Yamaguchi Children's Cancer Study Group (KYCCSG) protocol, ALL-96, for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (ASH meeting in 2005). The 7-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 72% (95% CI; 68 - 76 %) and 85 % (95% CI; 80 - 90 %), respectively. Following protocol, ALL-02, was aimed to assess the usefulness of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based minimal residual disease (MRD) in the same context as ALL-96 protocol. Purpose In this combined analysis, we analyzed the outcome and risk factors for relapse/survival in children with T-ALL who were treated with the ALL-96/ALL-02 protocols. Study Design and Treatment A total of 42 patients (22 of 218 in ALL-96 and 20 of 165 in ALL-02, 26 males and 16 females) with median age of 8 years (range 1 - 14) were treated. Patients were classified into 2 groups, standard risk (SR) and high risk (HR). HR patients had one of the followings: high white blood cell (WBC) counts more than 50,000/\u03bcl, T-cell immunophenotype, central nervous system (CNS) disease at diagnosis, organomegaly (hepatomegaly or splenomegaly more than 5 cm below costal margin), M2/3 marrow at day 15 of induction therapy. Both protocols consisted of induction, early intensification, consolidation, late intensification and maintenance therapy. Predonisolone (PSL), weekly vincristine (VCR), 4 doses of daunorubicin (DNR), 8 doses of L-asparaginase (L-asp) and 2 or 4 doses of intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX) depending on the CNS status, were given during induction. In early intensification, DNR, cytarabine (CA), etoposide and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) were given. Consolidation consisted of intermediate dose of MTX, combination of cyclophosphamide(CPM), CA and 6-MP, and high dose CA. Late intensification similar to induction included 2 weeks of dexamethasone (DEX), weekly VCR, 2 doses of pirarubicin, single dose of CPM, 5 doses of L-asp and IT-MTX followed by combination of CA, 6-MP, IT-MTX along with 18 Gy cranial irradiation in 12 fractions. In ALL-96 protocol, patients were randomized to receive maintenance therapy of either combination of 6-MP/MTX and DEX/ VCR pulse (A-arm) or LSA2L2-type therapy (B-arm). In ALL-02 protocol, A-arm was chosen as a maintenance therapy based on result of ALL-96. No patient underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in 1 st complete remission (CR). Results Median follow-up periods were 96 and 38 months in ALL-96 and ALL-02, respectively. Two patients were off-protocol before achieving CR because of toxicity and chromosome abnormality with t(4;11). Induction rate in 40 patients was 95%. All 14 events were relapses and TRM rate was 0%. Last event occurred at 40 months. The sites of relapse were isolated BM in 9, isolated testis in 2, isolated CNS in 1 and combined sites in 2. Nine died from disease progression and 2 died from toxicity after SCT in 2 nd CR. The 4-year EFS and OS rates in all patients were 55 % (95 % CI; 39 \u2013 71 %) and 71 % (95 % CI; 56 -86 %), respectively. EFS of ALL-96 and ALL-02 were 50 %[95 % CI; 29 -71 %]) and 65 % [95 % CI; 45 - 85 %]), respectively. OS of ALL-96 and ALL-02 were 59 % [95 % CI; 39 \u2013 80 %]) and 90 % [95 % CI; 77 - 103 %]), respectively ( p = 0.063). EFS of patients treated in A and B arm were 60 % [95 % CI; 41 -71 %]) and 55 % [95 % CI; 25 - 84 %]), respectively. None of age, sex, organomagaly, WBC, chromosomal abnormalities, CNS status, protocol, and maintenance arm was identified as a risk factor for relapse or survival. Two of 10 (ALL-96) and 3 of 4 (ALL-02) relapsed patients have survived with allogeneic SCT. Conclusion Although T-ALL patients received an intensified treatment including cranial radiation, the outcome was unsatisfactory. One possible explanation for better OS in ALL-02 protocol is that the majority of relapsed patients in ALL-02 were salvaged by SCT in 2 nd CR.
