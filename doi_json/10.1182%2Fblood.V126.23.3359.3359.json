    "abstract_text": "Background Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction by hemin inhibitsHIV-1 infection in cultured macrophages and T-cells and also in HIV-1 infected humanized mice via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway (reviewed in [1]). LPS-treated human macrophages express HO-1 which may protect them against HIV-1 infection through the production of MIP1\u03b1, MIP1\u03b2 and LD78\u03b2 chemokines that decrease CCR5 expression. Iron depletion by iron chelators or through the expression of ferroportin, an iron export protein, inhibited HIV-1 [2, 3]. Objective We analyzed the effect of heme on HIV-1 infection in macrophages and the contribution of heme and iron regulatory proteins including HO-1, ferroportin and hepcidin and cell cycle regulatory cell cycle dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and p21, which are deregulated by iron depletion. We also analyzed SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) as it was shown to be regulated by CDK2 and p21. Methods One round HIV-1 infection was analyzed in THP-1 cells infected with VSVg-pseudotyped HIV-1 expressing luciferase. Gene expression and protein expression analysis was carried out using RNA and protein isolated from hemin treated and untreated cells using RT PCR western blot respectively. Specific gene knock-downswere generated in THP-1 cells using lentivirus expressing gene-targeted shRNAs. Results In heme-treated THP-1 cells, mRNA expression of ferroportin, p21, SAMHD1, hypoxia-induced factor (HIF)-1\u03b1, and IKB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB inhibitor was increased and CDK2 expression decreased. Stable ferroportin knock-down prevented HIV-1 inhibition in THP-1 cells. Treatment with hepcidin also restored HIV-1 inhibition in hemin treated THP-1 cells. Ferritin levels increased in Hemin treated THP1 cells and decreased when cells were treated with tin protoporphyrin (SnPP) IX inaddtion to hemin, suggesting that HO-1 induction leads to intracellular iron accumulation. In addition, hemin treatment reduced the expression of p65 subunit of NF-kB and induced expression of NF-\u03baB inhibitor, IKB\u03b1. We also observed increased expression of p21 and decreased expression of CDK2 in the cells treated with hemin and accumulation of the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Both CDK2 and p21 control phosphorylation of SAMHD1 which in turn controls the dNTP pool and prevents HIV-1 reverse transcription. We observed reduced expression of CDK2 and increased expression of SAMHD1 and p21 in hemin treated cells, which may also contribute to the inhibition of HIV-1. Stable HIF-1a knockdown in THP-1 cells increased HIV-1 replication indicating that HIF-1a might also restrict HIV-1 replication. Conclusion Our study shows that induction of HIF-1a and iron export and utilization proteins protects hemin-treated THP-1 cells from HIV-1 infection. Block of HIV-1 inhibition by heme in THP-1 cells with stable ferroportin knock-down and restoration of HIV-1 replication with hepcidin in heme-treated THP-1 cells suggest that ferroportin plays a key role in the HIV-1 inhibition. Additional molecular mechanisms of heme-mediated HIV-1 inhibition might also include NF-kB inhibition by IKB\u03b1, reduction of CDK2 expression and induction of SAMHD1 and p21. Thus this complex deregulation of iron metabolism leads to the inhibition of HIV-1 transcription.
