    "abstract_text": "MEL 200 is now generally accepted to represent the best preparative regimen for autotransplantation in MM patients. We have previously reported that DT-PACE is very effective in inducing rapid responses even in high risk myeloma (JCO 2003, 31: 73\u201380). The present study aimed at comparing outcome and toxicity of previously treated (\u2265 2 cycles of prior therapy) MM patients, who were randomized to tandem transplants with either MEL 200 or MEL 140 plus full dose DT-PACE administered over two days (MEL/DT-PACE). The treatment in both arms consisted of one induction cycle with DT-PACE, followed by tandem transplants (randomized), one consolidation cycle with DT-PACE and 2 years of maintenance therapy with dexamethasone (20mg/d, days 1\u20134, every 3 weeks) plus thalidomide 100mg/day. 97 patients were enrolled; 93 collected sufficient stem cells for transplantation and were randomized to MEL 200 (N=48) or MEL140/DT-PACE (N=45). Event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier plots. Graphs were compared with logrank statistics. Median age was 57 years. Prior to study enrollment \u03b2 2 M was \u2265 4mg/L in 28%; CRP \u2265 4 mg/L in 59%; LDH \u2265 250 U/L in 16%. 16% had > 12 months preceding therapy and 27% showed abnormal metaphase cytogenetics. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups, except for a trend of more patients with \u03b2 2 M \u2265 4mg/: in the MEL 200 arm (p=0.09). 100% of randomized patients proceeded to the first transplant and 82% to a second; 87% in the MEL/DT-PACE and 77% in the MEL 200 arm (p=0.23). The CR rates were identical (44% and 42%, respectively). EF/OS at 3 years were 51%/71% in the MEL/DT-PACE arm and 55%/79% in the MEL 200 arm (p=.89/.73) (Figure 1). Recovery of ANC > 500\u03bcl plus platelets > 20,000/\u03bcl untransfused, was comparable after the first (p=0.21) and second transplant (p=0.17). Grade 3\u20135 toxicity was lower in the MEL/DT-PACE arm in terms of mucositis (p=.006) and febrile neutropenia (p=.001). We conclude that both preparative regimens, MEL 200 and 140 with the addition of DT-PACE, appear equally effective in previously treated MM patients. However, the Mel 140 resulted in a significantly lower incidence of mucositis and febrile neutropenia and may thus be preferred in patients not in excellent clinical condition prio to transplantation.
