    "abstract_text": "Background: Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT), an autosomal recessive inherited platelet disorder, is a moderate to severe bleeding syndrome caused by the absence of platelet aggregation due to quantitative and/or qualitative deficiencies of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin. We recently identified 41 causative missense mutations of which 24 were novel in a large cohort of 76 GT families (Genoscope project). These mutations mainly localize to the headpiece region of the integrin that has been well studied but 4 mutations although extracellular were proximal to the plasma membrane. We therefore performed molecular modeling of these 4 mutations to obtain new insights into the structure of a poorly understood region of this unique receptor. Aim : To identify structures or conformations engaged in the stability of the integrin and which are important for maturation and expression. Results : Of the 4 novel selected mutations, 3 concerned the calf-2 domain of \u03b1IIb - Gly792Glu (G823E, nomenclature with leader sequence), Leu924Gln (L955Q) and Thr953Lys (T984K) and one the EGF-3 domain of \u03b23 Gly540Asp (G566D). All of these mutations affected highly conserved amino acids and were predicted to be damaging by in silico analysis (SIFT, Polyphen). None influenced glycosylation or mRNA splicing. They were present either in a homozygous form (\u03b23 G540D) or were heterozygous in association with an identified and proven null mutation. Three were associated with type I GT (<5% \u03b1IIb\u03b23), while the \u03b1IIbG792E mutation occurred in a patient with type II GT (with 10% residual \u03b1IIb\u03b23) whose much reduced but partial transport to the surface was confirmed following expression of the recombinant integrin in CHO cells (with pro-\u03b1IIb predominating in the cytoplasm). The structural implications of these amino acid substitutions was assessed using PyMol Molecular Graphics System version 1.3 (www.pymol.org) based on the crystallographic data of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in the bent non-activated state (3fcs PDB file). Amino acids were visualized in the rotamer form showing side change orientations incorporated from the Dunbrack Backbone library with the maximum probability. We first determined that the \u03b1IIb calf-2 domain has a \u03b2 barrel-like structure largely composed of hydrophobic amino acids whose side chains orientate towards the inner cavity. Interestingly, L924Q and T953K substitutions occur at or adjacent to a conserved motif consisting of five polar amino acids central to the \u03b2 barrel protected from H 2 O molecules and involved in H-bond interactions. This particular motif, specific to calf-2, may introduce rigidity close to the membrane. Both L924Q and T953K disrupt the \u03b2 barrel motif and promote flexibility. G792E is situated between the calf-1 and calf-2 domains in an unstructured connecting loop between two adjacent \u03b2 sheets. Its replacement by the larger negatively charged Glu introduces steric encumbrance and results in an increase of the angle formed by the two calf domains, probably leading to the straightening of the second distal part of the long arm of \u03b1IIb. The \u03b23 G540D substitution is found in the EGF3 domain of \u03b23 that occurs at the axe of the cysteine-rich domain of the \u03b23 arm, facing the \u03b1IIb calf-1 and calf-2 domains in the intact integrin. This substitution with the introduction of a charged and larger amino acid results in a weaker link between the two \u03b2 sheets of EGF-3 and a loss of H-bonds. The result is an increased fragility within the \u03b23 arm structure notably at the site of two stacked aromatic amino acids (H539 and W553) with a moving apart of the \u03b2 sheets. Conclusions: We show that 4 novel missense mutations in the extracellular membrane-proximal domains of \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 cause conformational changes in domains that control the overall structure of the newly formed integrin. They show how the structure of both domains is under tight quality control and that precisely defined conformations are indispensable for \u03b1IIb\u03b23 maturation.
