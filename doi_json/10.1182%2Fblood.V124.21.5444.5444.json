    "abstract_text": "Objectives Patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with high risk of CNS infiltration or recurrence may receive prophylaxis or be treated with intrathecal injections (IT) of liposomal cytarabine (LC) once every 2 weeks (due to its sustained release of cytarabine). Sequential flow cytometric studies in patients with CNS involvement and treated with LC, allow to detect tumor cells as well as LC liposomes (LCL) in the CSF. The true meaning of the presence of these liposomes during the treatment with LC is still unknown. Patients and Methods In this study, we aimed to investigate the presence of LCL detected by Flow Cytrometry (FC) among 166 CSF samples of 69 patients treated with LC. Samples were taken before each administration of intrathecal LC and centrally processed. Results Results are shown in the below table. Abstract 5444.

It was found no relationship between the amount of LCL and toxicity. Conclusions: Presence of LCL in CSF is detected in 15-20% of patients receiving IT LC as prophylaxis / treatment and it does not show a direct relationship with presence of toxicity. Although the true clinical significance of the presence of LCL in CSF remains unknown, their monitoring could be useful to individualize the treatment with CL IT (dose and time between doses). Disclosures Off Label Use: Liposomal cytarabine is not approved for prophylaxys of lymphomatous meningitis.."
