Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (Len + Dex) was well tolerated and demonstrated significant improvements in response and favorable overall survival (OS) compared with Placebo + Dex in 2 pivotal phase 3 registration trials in patients with relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM; Weber et al, NEJM 2007; Dimopoulos et al, NEJM 2007). Previously, in a phase 3, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, expanded-access study (MM-018), Len + Dex demonstrated a predictable safety profile that can preserve patient quality of life (QoL) (Yong et al Haematologica 2010 [abstract #0944]). Here we report efficacy, safety, and QoL data for patients enrolled in the Spanish cohort of MM-018. Methods: Patients with progressive disease after > 2 cycles of antimyeloma treatment, or after relapse from treatment, with ECOG performance status \u2264 2 received 28-day cycles of Len (25 mg/day, D 1\u201321) plus Dex (40 mg/day, D 1\u20134, 9\u201312, and 17\u201320 for cycles 1\u20134; D 1\u20134 in subsequent cycles). Endpoints included overall response (\u2265 partial response [PR] by European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria) and QoL assessments measured by EORTC QLQ C-30 and EORTC QLQ MY-20 questionnaires at baseline and week 24. All prophylaxis was administered at the investigator's discretion. Results: Sixty-three patients receiving \u2265 1 dose of Len + Dex were evaluated for efficacy, safety, and QoL. Median age was 62 years (21 [33.3%] were > 65 years). Prior therapies included thalidomide (n = 15, 24%) and bortezomib (n = 37, 59%). Additionally, 5 (8%) patients had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and 23 (37%) had a history of peripheral neuropathy. A PR or better was observed in 49 (78%) patients, including complete response (CR) in 13 (21%), very good partial response (VGPR) in 13 (21%), and PR in 23 (37%) patients. Median time to first response and best response was 2.7 and 4.5 months, respectively. Median duration of response was 18.4 months. Response depth improved after long-term treatment with Len + Dex, and 32/63 (51%) patients received >12 cycles of therapy. Beyond 12 cycles of therapy, 8 patients achieved VGPR and 12 patients achieved CR; compared with 5 patients and 1 patient, respectively, prior to 12 cycles. Median time to progression and progression-free survival were both 13.3 months; median OS has not yet been reached. Forty-two (67%) patients remained on study at 6 months. Compliance to QoL assessment questionnaires was \u2265 80%. Patient-reported improvements in QoL and disease symptoms measured by both questionnaires were observed in nearly all scales. EORTC QLQ C-30 scores revealed clinically meaningful improvement (> 5 points) for global QoL (n = 15, 40%), fatigue (n = 16, 42%), emotional function (n = 15, 40%), physical function (n = 12, 32%), role function (n = 11, 29%), social function (n = 11, 29%), cognitive function (n = 10, 26%), and pain (n = 9, 24%) at 6 cycles compared with baseline. Preservation of QoL in role function, emotional function, social function, and pain scores was observed at 6 cycles when compared with baseline in responders (\u2265 PR). EORTC QLQ MY-20 results revealed no relevant median change (> 5 points) from baseline in all scales for all patients completing questionnaires at baseline and 6 cycles, except for a meaningful improvement in future perspective scores (median 11.1-point change). Adverse events observed in this study were consistent with those previously reported with Len + Dex. Grade 3/4 hematologic events were experienced by 40 (64%) patients, and included neutropenia (n = 32, 51%), thrombocytopenia (n = 11, 17%), anemia (n = 10, 18%), and febrile neutropenia (n = 4, 6%). DVT (all grades) was experienced by 5 (8%) patients, and only one grade 3/4 new-onset peripheral neuropathy was observed after 6 cycles of treatment. Conclusions: Len + Dex treatment in this expanded-access study demonstrated efficacy and predictable safety, consistent with that of previously published trials for patients with RRMM. More patients achieved VGPR and CR after long-term therapy compared with those receiving < 12 cycles of therapy. Furthermore, QoL assessments at baseline and 6 months revealed that patients treated with Len + Dex showed meaningful improvements in certain QoL and symptom scores.
