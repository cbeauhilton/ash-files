    "abstract_text": "Abstract 953 Introduction: The WHO classification in 2008 listed for the first time aberrant expression of genes as molecular genetic alterations affecting outcome in AML. High expression of BAALC , ERG and MN1 were shown thus far to be associated with unfavorable outcome in normal karyotype AML (AML-NK). In addition high EVI1 expression was suggested to predict poor outcome. Recently, our group identified low expression of CDKN1B as a favorable prognostic marker. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of BAALC , CDKN1B , ERG , EVI1 and MN1 in AML comprising all cytogenetic risk groups with respect to their association with distinct cytogenetic and known molecular genetic subgroups and their impact on prognosis. Patients/Methods:: Expression levels of BAALC , CDKN1B , ERG , EVI1 and MN1 were determined by oligonucleotide microarrays (HG-U133 Plus 2.0, Affymetrix) in 286 AML (t(15;17) n=15; t(8;21) n=16; inv(16) n=7; normal karyotype n=99; 11q23/ MLL -rearrangements n=10; complex karyotype n=51; other abnormalities n=88). Patients were further analyzed for mutations in NPM1 , FLT3- ITD , CEPBA and MLL -PTD. Results: Expression of BAALC , CDKN1B , ERG , EVI1 and MN1 varied significantly between genetic subgroups: While t(15;17), t(8;21) and 11q23/ MLL -rearrangements were associated with low CDKN1B expression, AML-NK and NPM+ cases showed a higher CDKN1B expression. Lower BAALC expression was observed in AML with t(15;17), 11q23/ MLL -rearrangement and AML-NK as well as in FLT3 -ITD+ AML and in NPM1 + AML, while in AML with other abnormalities a higher BAALC expression was observed. ERG expression was lower in AML with 11q23/ MLL -rearrangement and normal karyotype, while it was higher in AML with complex karyotype. Low EVI1 expression was observed in AML with t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16) and AML-NK, while it was higher in AML with 11q23/ MLL -rearrangements. Low MN1 expression was associated with t(15;17), t(8;21) and AML-NK, while it was increased in cases with inv(16) or other abnormalities. Next, Cox regression analysis was performed with respect to overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS). In the total cohort high BAALC and ERG expression as continuous variables were associated with shorter OS and EFS while CDKN1B , EVI1 and MN1 had no impact. Furthermore the cohort was subdivided into quartiles of expression for each gene. After inspection of the survival curves the cut-off for high vs low expression was set as follows: BAALC : 75 th percentile, CDKN1 B: 25 th percentile, ERG and MN1 : 50 th percentile. For EVI1 expression pts were separated into expressers (n=44) and non-expressers (n=242). Low CDKN1B expression was associated with longer OS and EFS in the total cohort (p=0.005, not reached (n.r.) vs 14.9 months (mo); p=0.013, 31 vs 9.7 mo). High BAALC expression had no impact on OS, but was associated with shorter EFS in the total cohort as well as in AML with intermediate cytogenetics and AML with other abnormalities (p=0.032, 6.2 vs 13.0 mo; p=0.027, 5.1 vs 11.3 mo; p=0.006, 2.3 vs 14.8 mo). High ERG expression was significantly associated with shorter OS and EFS in the total cohort (p=0.002, 12.5 mo vs n.r.; p=0.001, 8.1 vs 15.7 mo) as well as in AML-NK (p=0.001, 11.3 mo vs n.r.; p=0.010, 7.2 vs 22.1 mo). OS was also shorter in AML with unfavorable karyotype (p=0.048, median OS 9.3 mo vs n. r.). With respect to MN1 high expressers had a significantly shorter OS and EFS in the total cohort (p=0.004, 12.3 mo vs. n.r.; p=0.001, 8.1 vs 16.7 mo) as well as in AML-NK (p=0.001, 9.7 mo vs n.r.; p=0.001, 5.1 vs 22.1 mo). In a multivariate analysis including CDKN1B , ERG and MN1 all parameters retained their impact on OS as well as on EFS, while BAALC lost its impact on EFS. Adding MLL -PTD, NPM1 +/ FLT3- ITD-, favorable and unfavorable karyotype into the model demonstrated an independent significant adverse impact on OS for MLL -PTD (p=0.027, relative risk (RR): 2.38) and ERG expression (p=0.044, RR: 1.59) only. In the respective analysis for EFS only favorable karyotype showed an independent association (p=0.002, RR: 0.261). Conclusion: 1) Expression of BAALC , CDKN1B , ERG , EVI1 and MN1 varies significantly between cytogenetic subgroups. 2) BAALC as a continuous variable and CDKN1B , ERG and MN1 as dichotomized variables are independently predictive for OS and EFS in AML. 3) ERG expression even retains its independent prediction of shorter OS if cytogenetic and other molecular genetic markers are taken into account.
