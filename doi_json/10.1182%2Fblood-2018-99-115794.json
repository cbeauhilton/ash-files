Introduction : LCH results from clonal proliferation of functionally and immunophenotyped inmature round Langerhans cells along with eosinophiles, machrophages, lymphocytes and ocasionally multinucleated giant cells (1). Its incidence is 2-10 cases by million of children below 15 yr in US (2). Our objective was to describe the clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of patients with LCH at Departement of Hematology-Oncology of Hospital Civil de Guadalajara M\u00e9xico. Methods: It was a retrospective design and 41 pediatric patients below 18 yr were included. The diagnosis was corroborated by pathology and immunohistochemistry. Variables as age, gender, localised vs systemic disease, risk organ commitment, global survival (GS) and event free survival (EFS) were analysed. We used descriptive and inferencial statistics with SPSS program. Results : There were included 41 patients from January 1st 2012 to December 31st 2017. Relation male:female was 1.1:1. Mean presentation was localised disease (58%). Bone was the principal affected structure (34%) and it was 71% to be combined with lung, lymph node and CNS compromise. Risk organ commitment was presented in 32%, being more frecquent bone marrow and liver in 22% each one. Time induction treatment was equal or below 12 weeks in 66% of patients. The 25% of patients had reactivation of LCH, with similar lesions to the beggining in 19.5%. We found statistically significant differences between dead patients (DP) (14.6%) and not dead patients (NDP) (85.4%) in clinical presentation: localised (0% in DP vs 69% in NDP) and systemic disease (100% vs 31%) (p=0,003) and risk organ commitment (100% in DP vs 20% in NDP) (p=0,000). Median age of 13 vs 24 months was for DP and NDP respectively. Conclusion: Dead patients were younger than 13 months old, with systemic disease, and risk organ commitment. We found a later asking of medical advice in DP (6 months) vs NDP (2 months). Keys words: langerhans cell histiocytosis, multisystem disease, risk organ Figure. View large Download slide Figure.
