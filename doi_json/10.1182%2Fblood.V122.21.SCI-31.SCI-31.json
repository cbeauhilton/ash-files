    "abstract_text": "Platelets have long been known to promote metastasis, and multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including adhesion, coagulation, and protection against natural killer (NK) cells or turbulence. One mechanism that has been little explored is the possibility that platelets might secrete growth factors or provide other stimuli that could enhance the malignant properties of tumor cells. We have shown that pretreatment of carcinoma cells with platelets induces an EMT-like transformation in their properties in vitro and renders them much more metastatic after introduction into mice. TGF-\u03b2, produced by platelets and released on their activation is essential for both the in vitro and the in vivo effects. However, TGF-\u03b2 alone is insufficient; platelet-tumor cell contact is also required and this contact activates NFkB signaling, which synergizes with the TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Both signals are required for the enhancement of metastasis. In addition to enhancing migration and invasion in vitro , platelets enhance extravasation in vivo . Earlier work has shown that both P-selectin (expressed on platelets) and L-selectin (expressed on leukocytes) are essential for efficient metastasis, and aggregates of tumor cells, platelets, and leukocytes can be observed at sites of tumor cell arrest and extravasation. It has also been demonstrated by others that leukocytes can enhance extravasation and metastatic seeding. Therefore, we have been interested in the question of the relative roles of platelets and leukocytes in these processes. Which cell types are recruited at the sites of metastatic seeding? Does one cell type depend on another? Which cell types enhance metastasis? What roles do the platelets play in recruiting the other cell types? The involvement of platelets in enhancing metastasis also raises questions about the effects of platelets on circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Could platelets enhance the metastatic capacity of CTCs? Could it be the case that only those CTCs that are associated with platelets and/or leukocytes are functionally involved in seeding metastases? Such aggregates are not scored in most current assays for CTCs and will require new investigative approaches. Platelet participation in metastasis also raises the possibility of therapeutic interventions targeting platelet-specific targets and the paracrine interactions between them and other cells.
