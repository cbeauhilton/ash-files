    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2080 Elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is ameliorative for beta-globin gene disorders. Butyrate, a short chain fatty acid, is a potent inducer of fetal hemoglobin with limited clinical applicability. We wanted to examine non-globin gene targets of butyrate that are regulated in definitive erythroid cells prior to the induction of embryonic/fetal beta-type globin genes. Mechanistic insights may improve clinical utility for short chain fatty acids by identifying novel molecular therapeutic targets. Table I.

View Large Induced embryonic/fetal globin gene expression is detectable in murine fetal liver-derived definitive erythroid cells (FL EryD) from wildtype and human beta-globin YAC transgenic mice after 19 hours in culture with butyrate & erythropoietin (EPO), but not in EPO alone. Differential regulation of non-globin gene targets in wildtype FL EryD was studied on a Mouse Gene 1.0ST Affymetrix Array after culture in EPO only or butyrate & EPO at 6 hours (when no embryonic globin gene expression is detectable, n=3). Data from biological replicates were normalized by robust multichip average and analyzed with expression console software. As shown in Table 1 , several confirmed and putative repressors of embryonic/fetal beta-type globin gene expression, including SOX6 , Bcl11A , and Ikaros 1 (but not cMyb ) were significantly down regulated by Butyrate at 6 hours (n=3); this was confirmed by RT-PCR. The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), which also induces embryonic globin gene expression in murine FL EryD, has a directionally similar effect ( Table 1 ). Down regulation of some fetal/embryonic globin gene repressors, relative to identically handled EPO-only treated samples, was detectable by RT-PCR as early as 60 to 120 minutes after butyrate induction. These repressors included Bcl11A (60min: 0.66\u00b10.005, p<.001, n=2; 120min: 0.4\u00b10.24, p<.01, n=4), Sox6 (60min: 0.55\u00b1 0.18, p=0.08, n=2; 120min: 0.63\u00b1 0.06, p<.001, n=4) and Ikaros1 (60min: 0.63\u00b10.45, p=0.36, n=2; 120min: 0.42\u00b10.15, p<.001, n=4). The proximate molecular mechanisms through which butyrate act, while unknown in detail, have been posited to include \u2018stress\u2019 signaling via p38 and/or direct activation of gamma-globin gene expression through inhibited histone deacetylation. We found no evidence for butyrate-mediated enhancement of p38 phosphorylation in FL EryD at 0\u2013120 minutes in culture. However, bulk histone acetylation measured by western for histone 3 (H3), was >1.5 fold greater with butyrate induction at 60\u201390 minutes relative to baseline, while less than baseline in EPO-only treated FL EryD (n=2). Cumulatively, these data suggest that the down regulation by butyrate of major molecular repressors of embryonic/fetal globin gene expression, likely mediated directly or indirectly through epigenetic modifications, is a key underlying mechanism for the induction of fetal hemoglobin in definitive erythroid cells by short chain fatty acids.
