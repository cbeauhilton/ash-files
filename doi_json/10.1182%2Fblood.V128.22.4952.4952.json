    "abstract_text": "Background : Investigational non-factor products, such as ACE 910 (Emicizumab), offer potential new treatment options for hemophilia patients with inhibitors. However, their uncertain and unregulated mechanisms of action raise multiple concerns around safety and efficacy in specific clinical contexts. As an antibody to FIXa and FX, ACE 910 lacks the inherent regulatory characteristics that are present in replacement factor and bypassing agents in the context of hemostasis. FEIBA is a plasma-derived, activated prothrombin complex concentrate developed to prevent and treat bleeding episodes in hemophilia A and B patients with inhibitors. There are more than 40 years of clinical experience with FEIBA. Extensive prospective clinical study data, as well as post-approval pharmacovigilance data demonstrated the product to be safe and highly effective. In an ongoing phase III study (NCT02622321), hemophilia A patients with inhibitors are treated with Emicizumab. To evaluate the treatment options for ACE910-treated patients experiencing breakthrough bleeding, we studied, in-vitro , the thrombin generation profile of various combinations of FEIBA with a biosimilar version of ACE910. Methods : A biosimilar antibody to Emicizumab (BS-Em) was expressed in mammalian cells, purified and extensively biochemically characterized. Therapeutic doses of BS-Em (200-600nM) in combination with several concentrations of FEIBA (0.1-1IU/ml) were analyzed in standard in-vitro thrombin generation (TG) experiments (1pM TF trigger) using 3 inhibitor patient plasma. A normal range of TG for the experimental conditions used was established using plasma from 34 healthy individuals. Results : The combination of FEIBA and BS-Em resulted in peak thrombin values of >500nM (600nM BS-Em/1IU/ml FEIBA) while the normal range was established to span peak thrombin levels of ~50-120nM thrombin. Titration experiments established that at 600nM BS-Em, FEIBA concentrations of >0.2IU/ml led to peak thrombin values 4- 10-fold higher than the normal range. Conclusions : Our in-vitro experiments demonstrate an excessive thrombin generation potential for the combination of BS-Em and FEIBA at concentrations expected to be generated in patients participating in this study. Caution and clinical judgement will be required when considering the use of ACE910 in hemophilia A patients with inhibitors as options to treat breakthrough bleeds if they occur might be reduced or lead to potential AE.
