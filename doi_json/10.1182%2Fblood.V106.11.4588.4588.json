    "abstract_text": "Hyper-CVAD represents an intensified program for the treatment of acute and chronic lymphoid malignancies. This protocol has been proposed as a highly efficient treatment for adult ALL with acceptable toxicity profile. Purpose: In our Institution, Hyper-CVAD was initiated in September 1999 and used as the primary treatment of adult ALL. We analyse and report here our results focusing on the efficacy and the toxicity of the program. Patients and methods: Patient population consisted of 24 de novo ALL (7 T-cell, 17 B-cell). M/F ratio was 11/13, median age 39 yrs,mean age 42,1 yrs (range 18\u201368 yrs). 7/24(29,1%) patients were older than 50yrs. Hyperleukocytosis of more than 100x109/L was present in 6/24(25%) cases (3 T-cell,3 B-cell), while splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and bulky disease were documented in 19/24, 17/24 and 1/24 cases respectively. Cytogenetic analysis was performed in 23/24 patients: in 11/23 it was normal, in 1/23 showed del(12), in 1/23 revealed just polyploidy and failed in 10/23 cases. Bcr-abl transcripts were detected in three cases. None of our patients presented with CNS disease (morphology & immunophenotyping). Median follow up was 12,5 months (range 1\u201365 mo). Treatment consisted of four cycles of Hyper-CVAD (including fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone) alternating with four cycles of methotrexate and cytarabine. All patients received intrathecal CNS prophylaxis and granulocyte stimulating factor support. Maintenance therapy consisted of two years of treatment with mercaptopurine, methotrexate, vincristine and prednisone (POMP). Imatinib was added in bcr-abl(+) cases. Results: Hematological complete remission was achieved in 21/24 (87,5%) de novo ALL cases: (11pts 4wk ). Primary resistance was documented in 2/24 cases which subsequently received other therapeutic protocols and eventually deceased. One patient died in early induction. From the group of remmiters 11/21 are alive in CR after median DFS of 21mo (mean DFS 32mo, range 3\u201357). Another 7/21 remitters-including one post autologous transplantation- relapsed after median of 4,5 mo and six of them deceased. 6/21 patients underwent allogeneic transplantation (4 alive in CR, 2 deceased from complications). Regimen-related toxic deaths occurred in 4/23 cases whilst in remission status. 6/8 \u03a4-ALLs entered CR but half of them latter relapsed (two in consolidation and one in maintenance). CNS involvement during therapy on hyper-CVAD was not detected in the subgroup of resistant/progressive patients. Conclusions: Within the limitations of the small patient number and relatively short follow up we confirm the effectiveness of hyper-CVAD in de novo ALL, albeight at a lower than expected magnitude. Furthermore, we are unable to confirm the reported excellent outcome in T-ALL. Infectious complications were significant despite the administration of growth factors and prophylactic antibiotics. Hyper-CVAD can prevent leukemia extention to CNS in both responders and non responders.",
