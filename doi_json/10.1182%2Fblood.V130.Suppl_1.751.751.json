    "abstract_text": "Background: Significant increase in life expectancy has been observed in patients with \u03b2-thalassemia in recent years. The improved survival, however, is accompanied by significant ongoing healthcare needs related to the chronic condition; therefore, quality of life (QoL) has emerged as a fundamental focus of comprehensive patient care. We compared QoL outcomes between transfusion-dependent (TD) and non-transfusion-dependent (NTD) patients with \u03b2-thalassemia in the routine clinical care setting. Method: Adult patients with \u03b2-thalassemia were prospectively enrolled in an observational study in Italy, Greece, Lebanon, and Thailand. All patients completed Short Form 36 Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Anemia (An) questionnaires at baseline, and then once every 3 weeks using a hand-held electronic device. This analysis evaluated QoL between TD and NTD patients at study entry. Transfusion dependent was defined as receiving \u2265 6 red blood cell (RBC) units in the 24 weeks prior to study entry and no transfusion-free period for \u2265 35 days during that period. Results: A total of 102 patients with \u03b2-thalassemia were enrolled, of which 52 were TD and 50 NTD. The mean age of patients was 31.2 years and 70 (68.6%) were females. On average, patients with TD \u03b2-thalassemia were 3.6 years younger ( P = 0.06) and had moderately higher hemoglobin values at baseline (8.8 vs 8.2 g/dL; P = 0.02). At study entry, all (100%) patients with TD \u03b2-thalassemia had received RBC transfusions within the 24 weeks prior to study entry, as per inclusion criteria, versus 5 (10%) patients with NTD \u03b2-thalassemia who had received RBC transfusions during the same time period. Patients with NTD \u03b2-thalassemia reported lower QoL on all domains and summary scores as captured by the SF-36v2 questionnaire, except for Role-Physical. On average, patients with NTD \u03b2-thalassemia experienced statistically significant lower QoL versus their TD counterparts on the domains of General Health (39.5 vs 44.0; P = 0.01), Vitality (49.3 vs 53.7; P = 0.01), and Mental Health (46.8 vs 50.8; P = 0.01), and in the Mental Component Summary Score (46.5 vs 50.8; P = 0.01). Similarly, patients with NTD \u03b2-thalassemia reported worse QoL scores from the FACT-An questionnaire on all domains and statistically significant differences were observed for Emotional Well-Being (18.5 vs 20.0; P = 0.02), Functional Well-Being (20.0 vs 23.2; P < 0.01), and FACT-General (82.9 vs 89.4; P = 0.01). Conclusions: In the routine clinical care setting, there are critical unmet medical needs for patients with NTD \u03b2-thalassemia as they experience worse QoL on many domains compared with patients with TD \u03b2-thalassemia. There is a need for new interventions to treat patients with NTD \u03b2-thalassemia and reduce their burden of disease.
