    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4838 Background Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) are so heterogeneous, that new prognostic scoring systems are being continuously developed to help choose the best treatment strategy. The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) excludes secondary MDS, prior therapy and Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) with leucocytosis. Recently, a new risk model has been published by Kantarjian et al. (Cancer 2008; 113; 6; 1351) that is applicable to all MDS patients. Aims To validate this new risk model in our MDS population. Methods We analyzed 253 patients reported from 15 centers in our country from Jan 2007 through Jun 2009. We took into account age, performance status (PS), hemoglobin, platelets, leucocytes, bone marrow blasts, karyotype, and transfusion requirements. The new model divided patients into 4 prognostic groups: Low Risk (LR): 0-4; Intermediate-1 (I-1): 5-6; Intermediate-2 (I-2): 7-8; and High Risk (HR): \u22659. We assessed the prognostic impact of this New Risk Model and compared results to IPSS. Mortality Rate and AML progression risk were analyzed. Results 164 patients were evaluable, mean age 69 (R 21-92), primary MDS: 144, and secondary MDS: 20. Risk Group assessment for the new score: LR (34%), I-1 (31%), I-2 (18%), and HR (17%). The mean Follow-up was 22 months; Results are shown in table and graphic. View large View Large Conclusion Even though our sample is not considerably big, and follow-up is short, we confirmed 4 categories with different prognosis and found a close correlation with Mortality Rate. This New Scoring System allowed us to identify Low Risk IPSS patients with different outcomes, highlighted the importance of adding new prognostic factors like age and performance status, refined the cut-offs of thrombocytopenia and anemia, and recognized the adverse impact of prior transfusions needs.
