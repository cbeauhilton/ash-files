    "abstract_text": "High level expression of FLT3 in acute myeloid (AML) and lymphoid (ALL) leukaemias has been demonstrated by PCR techniques. This suggests that FLT3 and its ligand may play a significant role in the proliferation of leukaemic blast cells. Mutations of FLT3 are the most common genetic lesion in AML, occurring in 20\u201330% of cases, and confer an adverse prognosis. Flow cytometry was used as an alternative method to investigate FLT3 expression in acute leukaemia. Surface expression of FLT3 was measured in 111 bone marrow or peripheral blood samples of patients with AML or ALL using a phycoerythrin-labelled monoclonal IgG1 antibody (Coulter-Immunotech). Exons 14 \u2013 15 and 20 were amplified from DNA extracted from mononuclear cells of 38 of the 111 samples. Internal tandem duplication (ITD) and mutation of the D835 position of the activation loop of FLT3 were identified by SSCP and direct sequencing. 82% (47/57) of AML and 81% (34/42) of B-lineage ALL samples showed \u2265 20% (range, 20 \u2013 97%) positivity for FLT3 using flow cytometry. The Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) was similar between the two groups and no significant difference was found between adult (82%) and paediatric (80%) samples. However, FLT3 expression in all 9 T-ALL samples (pro, intermediate and late subtypes) was negative with markedly reduced MFIs. Of the 25 AML cases tested for ITD/D835Y, 5 (20%) were positive (4 ITDs, 1 D835Y). Surface FLT3 expression in these 5 cases (% and MFI) was the same as in those with wild-type FLT3. No mutations of FLT3 were found in the ALL cases tested (9 B-ALL, 4 T-ALL). Of three biphenotypic leukaemias, one case with myeloid/B lineage positivity was FLT3+ by flow cytometry, while another with myeloid/T lineage markers, was FLT3\u2212. A diagnostic conundrum was a patient with AML morphologically (cytogenetics failed): CD33+, MPO\u2212, CD13\u2212 CD117\u2212; T-lineage markers CD2+, CD5+, CD7+, as well as TdT+. The T-lineage specific marker cytoplasmic CD3 was negative. Only FLT3 positivity allowed a definitive diagnosis of AML to be made. In conclusion, surface FLT3 expression was present in > 80% of AML and B-lineage ALL, but in 0% (0/9) of T-ALL cases. Detection of this antigen should be included in the diagnostic immunophenotyping of acute leukaemias and is important where T-ALL needs to be excluded. Flow cytometric FLT3 expression cannot differentiate cases with or without ITD or point mutations of FLT3.",
