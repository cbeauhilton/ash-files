    "abstract_text": "Abstract 883 Specific expression of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) in osteoclasts (OC), but not osteoblasts (OB), suggests its role in regulating osteoclastogenesis. Although Btk is critical in B cell maturation and myeloid function, it has not been characterized in plasma cell malignancies including multiple myeloma (MM) and Waldenstro\u0308m Macroglobulinemia (WM). We here investigate effects of PCI-32765, an oral, potent, and selective Btk inhibitor with promising clinical activity in B-cell malignancies, on OC differentiation and function within MM bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, as well as on MM and WM cancer cells. We further define molecular targets of Btk signaling cascade in OCs and MM in the BM milieu. In CD14+ OC precursor cells, RANKL and M-CSF stimulate phosphorylation of Btk in a time-dependent fashion; conversely, PCI-32765 abrogates RANKL/M-CSF-induced activation of Btk and downstream PLC\u03b32. Importantly, PCI-32765 decreased number of multinucleated OC (>3 nuclei) by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and the secretion of TRAP5b (ED 50 = 17 nM), a specific mature OC marker. It increased size of OCs and number of nuclei per OC, with significantly defective bone resorption activity as evidenced by diminished pit formation on dentine slices. Moreover, lack of effect of Dexamethasone on OC activity was overcome by combination of Dexamethasone with PCI-32765. PCI-32765 significantly reduced cytokine and chemokine secretion from OC cultures, including MIP1\u03b1, MIP1\u03b2, IL-8, TGF\u03b21, RANTES, APRIL, SDF-1, and activin A (ED 50 = 0.1\u20130.48 nM). It potently decreased IL-6, SDF-1, MIP1\u03b1, MIP1\u03b2, and M-CSF in CD138-negative cell cultures from active MM patients, associated with decreased TRAP staining in a dose-dependent manner. In MM and WM cells, immunoblotting analysis confirmed a higher Btk expression in CD138+ cells from majority of MM patients (4 out of 5 samples) than MM cell lines (5 out of 9 cell lines), whereas microarray analysis demonstrated a higher expression of Btk and its downstream signaling components in WM cells than in CD19+ normal bone marrow cells. PCI-32765 significantly inhibits SDF-1-induced adhesion and migration of MM cells. It further blocked cytokine expression (MIP1a, MIP-1\u03b2) at mRNA level in MM and WM tumor cells, correlated with inhibition of Btk-mediated pPLC\u03b32, pERK and NF-kB activation. Importantly, PCI-32765 inhibited growth and survival triggered by IL-6 and coculture with BM stromal cells (BMSCs) or OCs in IL-6-dependent INA6 and ANBL6 MM cells. Furthermore, myeloma stem-like cells express Btk and PCI-32765 (10\u2013100 nM) blocks their abilities to form colonies from MM patients (n=5). In contrast, PCI-32765 has no adverse effects on Btk-negative BMSCs and OBs, as well as Btk-expressing dendritic cells. Finally, oral administration of PCI-32765 (12 mg/kg) in mice significantly suppresses MM cell growth (p< 0.03) and MM cell-induced osteolysis on implanted human bone chips in a humanized myeloma (SCID-hu) model. Together, these results provide compelling evidence to target Btk in the BM microenvironment against MM and WM., strongly supporting clinical trials of PCI-32765 to improve patient outcome in MM and WM.
