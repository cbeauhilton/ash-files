    "abstract_text": "\u03b2-hemoglobinopathies are inherited disorders caused by mutations/deletions in the \u03b2-globin chain that lead to structurally defective \u03b2-globin chains or reduced (or absent) \u03b2-globin chain production. These diseases affect multiple organs and are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, representing a major public health challenge. Current gene therapy approaches for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies involve viral transduction of hematopoietic stem cells with antisickling globin genes. Hemoglobin A2 (HA2, \u03b12\u03b42), expressed at a low level due to the lack of Eklf binding motif in its promoter region, is fully functional and could be a valid anti-sickling agent in sickle cell disease, as well as a substitute of hemoglobin A in \u03b2-thalassemia. We had previously demonstrated that two Eklf-GATA1 fusion proteins could significantly activate \u03b4-globin expression in human CD34 + cells. Here we report the effects of Eklf-GATA1 on hemoglobin expression and phenotypic correction using erythrocytes cultured from mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells with sickle cell disease. We found that enforced expression of Eklf-GATA1 fusion protein enhanced globin gene expression in the erythrocytesas compared with vector control. The long-form Eklf-GATA1 up-regulated \u03b2-globin gene expression 1.8-fold, \u03b4-globin gene expression 3.3-fold, and \u03b3-globin gene expression 1.7-fold. The medium-form EKLF-GATA1 up-regulated \u03b4-globin gene expression 2.6-fold and \u03b3-globin 1.3-fold, but had no significant effect on \u03b2-globin gene expression. HPLC revealed a percentage of HA 2 was increased from 2.1 % in vector-transduced cells to 8.9% in medium-form Eklf-GATA-transduced-cells (p<0.01) and 6.3% in long-form Eklf-GATA-transduced-cells (p<0.01). Upon deoxygenation, the percentage of sickling erythrocyte was lower to 30.6% in medium-form Eklf-GATA-transduced cells as compared with 40.7% in vector-transduced-cells (p<0.05). Flow cytometry analyses of CD71/GPA and thiazole orange staining indicated that erythroid cell differentiation and enucleation were not affected by Eklf-GATA1. ChIP-sequencing analysis has demonstrated that Eklf-GATA1 fusion proteins and GATA1 having a similar protein-DNA binding pattern at a global level. Our results have found that the long form Eklf-GATA1 fusion protein has a major effect on \u03b4-globin induction than \u03b2-globin; the medium form Eklf-GATA1 is able to elevate \u03b4-globin expression without having an effect on \u03b2-globin expression. The above findings indicate that these fusion constructs could be a valuable genetic therapeutic tool for hemoglobinopathies, and warrant further preclinical study and evaluation.
