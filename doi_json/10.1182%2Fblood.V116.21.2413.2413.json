    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2413 High telomerase activity and telomere length are prognostic markers in CLL. In a previous study we described hTERT as potential CLL-specific antigen. The rate-limiting component of telomerase is telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), for which multiple transcripts exist. In particular two splicing sites named \u03b1 and \u03b2 have been described, which generate deleted transcripts. The existence of multiple hTERT transcripts suggests that telomerase activity may be regulated by transcriptional control mechanisms as well as alternative splicing. In this study, we validated real-time RT-PCR assays for quantification of the hTERT transcripts with either \u03b1 deletion (del-\u03b1, \u03b1-\u03b2+), or \u03b2 deletion (del-\u03b2, \u03b1+\u03b2-) or both (del-\u03b1\u03b2, \u03b1-\u03b2-). Only the full-length (FL, \u03b1+\u03b2+) transcript translates into a functional protein; the biological role of the other splice variants is still to be clarified. The aim of this work was to completely characterize hTERT splice variants in CLL, as well as study all hTERT splice variants in relation with disease activity. The splice variant pattern was studied in 68 CLL cases, 6 healthy controls and two CD34+ cell samples. Fourteen of 68 pts (20%) did not express any of the splice variants. FL (\u03b1+\u03b2+) was five-fold more expressed in patients with unmutated than with mutated IgVH genes (mean normalized expression 1.68\u00d710 \u221203 vs 3.36\u00d710 \u221204 , p=0.0004). FL levels correlated with the percentage of IgVH homology (r=0.36, p=0.005). The del-\u03b1 and the del-\u03b2 transcripts were also expressed at higher levels in IgVH unmutated patients than mutated patients (2.77\u00d710 \u221203 vs 4.45\u00d710 \u221204 , p=0.0004; and 8.78\u00d710 \u221204 vs 6.92\u00d710 \u221204 , p=0.002, respectively). The expression of all four transcripts was higher in progressive compared to non-progressive patients. For FL average expression levels in progressive and non-progressive patients were 1.55\u00d710 \u221203 vs 3.36\u00d710 \u221204 (p<0.0001), respectively; for del-\u03b1 2.5\u00d710 \u221203 vs 5.5\u00d70 \u221204 (p=0.0003), respectively; for del-\u03b2 4.89\u00d710 \u221204 vs 4.2\u00d710 \u221204 (p= 0.01), respectively and for del-\u03b1\u03b2 1.43\u00d710 \u221203 vs 2.16\u00d710 \u221203 (p<0.0001), respectively. FL expression was also significantly higher in progressive CLL patients compared to healthy controls (1.55\u00d710 \u221203 vs 2.04\u00d710 \u221204 , p=0.03), while no difference was seen with regard to the other variants. Subsequently, we analyzed IgVH mutated and unmutated patients separately. Notably, the difference in FL expression levels between progressive and non-progressive patients was found only in the unmutated subgroup (2.19\u00d710 \u221203 and 4.85\u00d710 \u221204 , respectively, p=0.04), whereas in patients with mutated CLL no difference could be identified. Overall, the levels of expression of FL transcript significantly correlated with those of the other splice variants: del-\u03b1 (r=0.52, p<0.0001), del-\u03b2 (r=0.50, p<0.0001), del-\u03b1\u03b2 (r=0.47, p<0.0001). Two patients (both IgVH mutated) were tested repeatedly in different disease phases and at disease progression an increase in FL transcript levels was seen, while the del-\u03b1 transcript decreased. The levels of FL transcript detected in CD34+ cells and in the K562 cell line were 4.09\u00d710 \u221204 and 1.85\u00d710 \u221203 , respectively, while for the del-\u03b1 transcript they were 5.36\u00d710 \u221204 and 1.73\u00d710 \u221203 , respectively and for the del-\u03b1\u03b2 transcript 1.67\u00d710 \u221203 and 4.93\u00d710 \u221203 , respectively. The del-\u03b2 transcript was not detected in CD34+ cells, while the expression in the K562 cell line was 2.7\u00d710 \u221203 . This study provides a detailed insight into the hTERT transcript pattern in patients with CLL and shows that the expression of hTERT-FL is independent of disease phase in IgVH mutated but not in unmutated patients. Our results highlight the necessity of focusing on the functional transcript when analyzing hTERT expression in CLL patients and of interpreting the results in various phases of the disease in relation to the IgVH mutational status. The possibility that hTERT-FL mRNA gives rise to CLL-specific antigens that may be targeted with immunotherapy will be the object of further studies.
