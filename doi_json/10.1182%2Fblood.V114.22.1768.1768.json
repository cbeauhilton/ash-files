    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1768 Poster Board I-794 Background Assessment of the safety profile, in particular renal function, of the oral iron chelator deferasirox (Exjade \u00ae ) is of particular relevance in MDS patients (pts), given their advanced age and associated decline in renal function. This 1-yr pooled analysis characterizes the safety profile of deferasirox in a large population of MDS and non-MDS pts (\u03b2-thalassemia [\u03b2-thal] and other anemias [sickle cell, Diamond-Blackfan, aplastic and other]), with emphasis on renal function. Methods Analysis is based on 1-yr pooled data from iron-overloaded pts who were enrolled in five open-label deferasirox studies: US02 and US03 (single-arm (SA), Low/Int 1 MDS pts, starting dose 20 mg/kg/day); 2409 (SA, pts with transfusional hemosiderosis, starting dose 20 mg/kg/day); 107 (randomized trial in \u03b2-thal pts, dosing 5\u201340 mg/kg/day) and 108 (SA, pts with chronic anemias, dosing 5\u201340 mg/kg/day). Datasets pooled: baseline (BL) characteristics, dosing, transfusion, adverse events (AEs) and laboratory data. Results 1798 pts were assessed (951 \u03b2-thal; 584 MDS, 263 other). MDS pts were older (median age 71 yrs) compared with those with \u03b2-thal (25 yrs) and other anemias (38 yrs). Mean actual dose of deferasirox (mg/kg/day): \u03b2-thal pts 23.5; MDS pts 20.3; other 19.9. Mean transfusional iron intake (mg/kg/day): 0.34, 0.32 and 0.23 in \u03b2-thal, MDS and other anemias, respectively. At 1 yr, 88%, 53% and 69% of \u03b2-thal, MDS and other pts remained in the study, respectively. Most frequent reasons for discontinuation: AEs (n=42 [4%] \u03b2-thal; n=115 [20%] MDS; n=34 [13%] other anemias). Frequency of drug-related AEs was similar for MDS (68%) and other anemias (63%) compared with 49% for \u03b2-thal. Most common drug-related AEs in \u03b2-thal, MDS and others, respectively, were: diarrhea (11%; 37%; 23%), nausea (7%; 15%; 20%), vomiting (3%; 8%; 8%); rash (11%; 8%; 6%); abdominal pain (6%; 7%; 8%) and upper abdominal pain (4%; 5%; 8%). 64 deaths occurred (none assessed as related to deferasirox by the investigator); 4 (primarily cardiac), 47 (primarily infections, hemorrhages, progression to AML, cardiac events) and 13 (primarily infections) in the \u03b2-thal, MDS and other pts, respectively. BL versus last available creatinine clearance (CrCl) were analyzed graphically for MDS pts with/without investigator-reported renal dysfunction AEs ( Figure ). CrCl for the majority of \u03b2-thal and non-MDS pts was >60 mL/min at BL (not shown), while in the MDS group, as expected, there were more pts with CrCl <60 mL/min and reported renal dysfunction AEs ( Fig. A ). To evaluate pts with BL CrCl <60 mL/min, an expanded view was created ( Fig. B ). A greater proportion of MDS pts with renal AEs was reported in the 20\u201370 yrs with primarily pre-existing chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes, hypertension and congestive heart failure. Pts with BL CrCl 40\u201360 mL/min had fewer pre-existing conditions, but still had reported renal dysfunction AEs. In about half of cases with BL CrCl <60 mL/min, reported renal dysfunction AEs were not associated with a clinically significant increase in SCr and corresponding CrCl decline, consistent with investigators' discretion in reporting.

The findings were also consistent with the clinical features of MDS such as advanced age and co-morbidities. Pts with BL CrCl <40 mL/min were more likely to report renal dysfunction AEs and less likely to be able to compensate for additional stresses on their existing decreased renal function, given their pre-existing co-morbidities and advanced age. Deferasirox may be used in pts with BL CrCl 40\u2013<60 mL/min with close monitoring, and should not be used in pts with BL CrCl <40 mL/min.
