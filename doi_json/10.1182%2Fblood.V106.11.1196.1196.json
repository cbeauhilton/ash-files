    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Although expression of \u03b21 integrins was analyzed in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), little is known about the clinical behaviour and the phenotyic profile of B-CLLs with different patterns of \u03b21 integrin expression. Methods: Expression of \u03b21 integrins (\u03b11-\u03b16) was investigated by flow cytometry along with other 30 surface molecules (B-cell markers, cell-adhesion-molecules, activation inducers, complement activity regulators) in 155 B-CLLs, 106 characterized for clinical stage (Rai\u2019s stages), 121 for IgV H mutations, 79 for ZAP-70 expression and 109 with survival data. Results: In agreement with previous studies, also in our B-CLL series CD49c, CD49d and, to a lesser extent, CD49e resulted the most expressed \u03b21 integrins, with mean expression values, evaluated as % of positive cells, of 59%, 36% and 26% (range 1-100%), respectively. Since expression of CD49c and CD49d have been recently identified by us as part of the immunophenotypic signatures of B-CLLs with different prognosis ( J Cell Physiol  204 , 113 , 2005 ), the present study was designed to define: 1) the real prognostic impact and the optimal cutoffs for CD49c and CD49d splitting patients into two groups with different survivals; 2) the immunophenotypic and molecular features of B-CLL subsets expressing different levels of CD49c and CD49d. 1) By applying the maximally selected log-rank statistics, we identified cutoff values of 40% and 30% of positive cells for CD49c and CD49d, respectively; therefore, B-CLL cases were divided in CD49c high or CD49c low and CD49d high or CD49d low if the expression of the molecules was above or below their respective cutoffs. The CD49c high B-CLL subset (n=78) displayed longer survival as compared to CD49c low cases (n=31; p=2.0x10-2, log-rank test); conversely, CD49d high B-CLLs (n=46) had shorter survivals, as compared to the CD49d low subset (n=62; p=1.2x10-3). 2) Supervised analyses were performed by comparing the expression of a wide panel of surface antigens in CD49c high vs. CD49c low and CD49d high vs. CD49d low B-CLLs. In addition, B-CLL subgroups, as identified by CD49c and CD49d expression, were compared for IgV H mutations (2% cutoff), ZAP-70 expression (30% cutoff) and Rai\u2019s stages distribution (stages 0-I vs. II-IV). According to these analyses, CD62L, CD22, CD55, CD29, CD11c, CD54 and CD40 were the molecules significantly over-expressed in good prognosis CD49c high B-CLLs, as compared to CD49c low cases (p<0.05; t-test); consistently, CD49c high vs. CD49c low B-CLLs had mutated:unmutated (M:UM) ratios of 2.2 vs. 0.6 (p=9.2x10-3; Chi-square Test). Bad prognosis CD49d high B-CLLs, as compared to CD49d low cases, over-expressed CD38, CD29, CD49e, CD79b and displayed a lower expression of CD11c (p<0.05). In the same subsets, M:UM ratios were 0.6 (CD49d high ) or 3.4 (CD49d low ; p=4.2x10-5; Chi-square Test); finally, the frequency of both ZAP-70+ cases and cases with advanced Rai\u2019s stages (II-IV) was significantly higher (p=5.6x10-4 and 2.9x10-2, respectively) in CD49d high B-CLLs. Conclusion: CD49c and CD49d identify B-CLL subsets with peculiar clinico-biological features, allegedly originating from different normal B cell counterparts; under a clinical standpoint, CD49c and CD49d may be employed as additional prognosticators for B-CLLs.",
