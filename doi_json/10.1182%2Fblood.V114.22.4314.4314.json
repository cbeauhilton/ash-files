    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4314 Backgrounds Neurologic complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have not been clearly described, especially in children. Methods We analyzed the medical records of 194 consecutive children (median: 7.2 years, range: 6 months-18.4 years) who underwent allogeneic HSCT for malignant or non-malignant hematologic disorders at Asan Medical Center between 1998 and 2009. Results Donors were matched siblings in 64, unrelated volunteers in 127 and haploidentical mothers in 3. Twenty-eight children (14%, 95% confidence interval[CI]: 9-19) developed neurologic complications within the first 6 months of HSCT. Calcineurin inhibitor associated-neurotoxicity was the most common neurologic complication (n=14), followed by cerebrovascular events (n=6), thrombotic microangiopathy-associated abnormalities (n=2), hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (n=2), CNS infection (n=1), metabolic encephalopathy (n=1), and events of undetermined cause (n=2). Univariate analysis showed that transplant from unrelated donor, peripheral blood grafts and occurrence of acute GVHD (>grade 1) were associated with significant increased risk of neurologic complications. In multivariate analysis, development of acute GVHD (>grade 1) was identified as an independent risk factor for early neurologic complications. Survival at 1-year was significantly inferior in patients who developed neurologic complications within 6 months of transplant (42% [95% CI: 23-61] versus 82% [95% CI: 76-88], p <0.0001). Conclusion Neurologic complications are significant clinical problems among children receiving HSCT, contributing to early death after transplant. Immediate diagnostic efforts to detect neurologic events are required in patients with clinically suspicious symptoms. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
