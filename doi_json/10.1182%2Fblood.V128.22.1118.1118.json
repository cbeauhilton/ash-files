    "abstract_text": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is currently treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) but these do not effectively eliminate the CML stem cells. As a consequence, CML stem cells persist and cause relapse in most patients upon drug discontinuation. Furthermore, no effective therapy exists for the advanced stages of the disease. Thus, there is still a need for novel treatment strategies in CML. We have previously shown that Interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP), a co-receptor of IL1R1, is highly expressed on primitive CML cells and that a polyclonal IL1RAP antibody can direct natural killer (NK) cells to specifically target and destroy CD34 + CD38 - CML cells in an in vitro-based antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay (J\u00e4r\u00e5s et al, PNAS, 2010). The aim of the present study was to investigate the consequences of IL1RAP expression on primitive CML cells and the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal IL1RAP antibodies against CML cells. Primary chronic phase (CP) CD34 + CML cells were cultured in medium supplemented with cytokines known to signal through receptor complexes involving IL1RAP. The addition of IL1 to the cultures resulted in a marked cellular expansion specifically for the primitive CD34 + CD38 - CML cells. Moreover, the CD34 + CD38 - cells showed phosphorylation of the downstream mediator of IL1-signaling NFKB. RNA-sequencing confirmed the activation of NFKB and of genes involved in cell cycling, indicating that IL1 stimulation of CD34 + CD38 - CML cells induced proliferation. Upon addition of an IL1RAP antibody capable of blocking IL1-signaling to the suspension cultures, the IL1-induced expansion and NFKB phosphorylation of CD34 + CD38 - CML cells was suppressed. Interestingly, both the IL1RAP expression and the response to IL1 as measured by NFKB phosphorylation was retained during TKI treatment of the cells. To assess the in vivo effects of IL1RAP antibodies in CML models, we first engrafted NOD/SCID mice with BCR/ABL1 expressing BV173 cells and treated the mice with the monoclonal IL1RAP antibody mAb81.2. Mice receiving treatment with mAb81.2 displayed a prolonged survival compared to controls, accompanied by reduced levels of leukemic cells in the BM. In vitro studies showed that mAb81.2 lacked a direct effect on cellular expansion or apoptosis. Instead, the IL1RAP antibody could direct NK cells to elicit killing of the leukemic cells, thereby suggesting effector cell mediated mechanisms to be an important in vivo mode-of-action. To validate the in vivo effects on primary CML cells, we next engrafted CP or blast phase (BP) CML cells into immunodeficient mice. Following engraftment of CP CD34 + CML cells into NSG mice and subsequent treatment with mAb81.2, a reduction of human myeloid cells was observed, suggesting that the treatment targeted the leukemic graft. Importantly, mAb81.2 treatment also reduced the levels of candidate CD34 + CD38 - IL1RAP + CML stem cells. Finally, BP CML cells were engrafted into NOD/SCID mice that have a more intact effector cell function compared to NSG mice. Following treatment with mAb81.2 a significant reduction of leukemic cells in the BM as well as in the periphery was observed compared to control mice. Importantly, secondary transplantations revealed a therapeutic effect also on the BP CML stem cells. In vitro ADCC assays confirmed that CML BP cells, including a sample with the highly TKI-resistant T315I mutation, could be targeted and killed using mAb81.2. We conclude that IL1RAP antibodies can suppress IL1-induced expansion of primitive CML cells and that in vivo administration of IL1RAP antibodies in CML xenograft models has anti-leukemic effects that extend to the CML stem cells. These results show that an antibody-based therapy against IL1RAP can be used to efficiently target CML stem cells.
