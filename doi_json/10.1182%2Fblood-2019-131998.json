    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: AML with myelodysplasia related changes (AML-MRC) is a heterogeneous disorder defined by multilineage dysplasia, presence of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-related karyotype, or history of prior MDS. Defining the outcomes within this heterogeneous subgroup of pts is necessary to select optimal therapy. METHODS: We evaluated all pts with AML-MRC diagnosed and treated at our institution from 2013 to 2018. All cases where reviewed by 2 hematopathologists to establish diagnosis of AML-MRC following WHO 2017 criteria. Patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms were excluded. Sequencing data was obtained by use of an 81-gene targeted, next generation sequencing (NGS) platform. Pts were classified into 4 categories: 1) AML-MRC was based on cytogenetic abnormalities (AML-MRC-C) in pts with definitory cytogenetic abnormalities; 2) AML-MRC with history of prior MDS or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) in 103 (25%) pts (AML-MRC-H); 3) AML-MRC with history of prior therapy for antecedent MDS or MDS/MPN (AML-MRC-S) and 4) AML-MRC with presence of >50% dysplasia in 3 lineages (AML-MRC-M) in pts with compatible morphologic features but none of the prior. We reviewed response and survival outcomes based on subgroup, therapy, and clinic-pathologic factors. RESULTS: A total of 415 pts with AML-MRC where identified. Median age at diagnosis was 70 years (range 18-94). A total of 243 (59%) pts had AML-MRC-C, 47 (11%) had AML-MRC-H, 28 (7%) had AML-MRC-S and 97 (23%) had AML-MRC-M. Among pts with a prior history of MDS or MDS/MPN, 23 (22%) had received therapy with hypomethylating agents, 1 (1%) with lenalidomide and 3 (3%) with ruxolitinib and 1 with 7+3 (1%) (these were categorized as AML-MRC-S). Median bone marrow blast percentage on aspirate was 35% (range 1-97%). Among pts with AML-MRC-C the defining cytogenetic abnormality included: complex karyotype in 186 (77%), monosomy 5 or del(5q) in 14 (6%), monosomy 7 or del(7q) in 38 (16%), concurrent chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities in 2 (1%), del(13q) in 2 (1%) and i(17) in 1 (0.5%) pt. Data on NGS was available in 95 pts. Identified mutations are shown in Figure 1A. Mutations in TP53 where more commonly observed in pts with AML-MRC-C (p=0.001). Prior publications (Lindsley et al Blood 2015) have shown that secondary-type mutations ( ASXL1, BCOR, EZH2, SF3B1, SRSF2, STAG2, U2AF1 and ZRSR2 ) identify a subset of pts with AML with worse than expected outcomes. Among evaluable pts, a total of 37 (39%) pts had secondary-type mutations. Based on variant allele frequency of identified mutations, mutations in ASXL1, BCOR, SF3B1 , SRSF2, and U2AF1 tended to appear in dominant clones. A total of 73 (18%) pts received therapy with single agent hypomethylating agents (HMA), 67 (16%) with HMA in combination with investigational drugs, 86 (21%) with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) based therapies and 119 (29%) with intensive chemotherapy. Response outcomes on evaluable pts are shown in Figure 1B. With a median follow up of 28.3 months (95% CI 25.7-30.9 months) the median overall survival (OS) was 10.5 months (95% CI 9.1-12.0 months). Pts with AML-MRC-M and AML-MRC-H had significantly better outcomes than those with AML-MRC-C or AML-MRC-S (overall p<0.001, Figure 1C). Among pts with AML-MRC-C those with complex karyotype had significantly worse outcomes than those with other defining cytogenetic abnormalities (p<0.001). Pts treated with intensive chemotherapy had improved OS compared to those treated with other forms of therapy (p=0.002, Figure 1D). However, when evaluating outcomes by AML-MRC subtype, use of intensive therapy was only associated with improved survival on AML-MRC-M (overall p=0.039, Figure 1E) but not in AML-MRC-C or AML-MRC-H (data not shown). No significant differences in OS were observed in pts with secondary-type mutations (p=0.568) but, among pts with AML-MRC-M presence of these mutations was associated with a trend to worse OS (median OS 3.8 months vs NR, p=0.228). CONCLUSION: AML-MRC is a heterogeneous group of AML with diverse mutational abnormalities and outcomes. Selection of therapy should be based on cytogenetic abnormalities and AML-MRC subtype.
