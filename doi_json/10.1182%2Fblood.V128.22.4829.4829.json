    "abstract_text": "Background: B-Thalassemia intermediate (B-TI) is a genetic disease that is milder than beta thalassemia major. The accumulation of iron in different organs causes tissue damage. The T2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique is currently the gold standard for iron load detection. However, it is expensive and needs an expert radiologist to report findings. Therefore, we conducted this study to determine an optimal cut-off value of ferritin in proportion to T2 MRI for early detection of cardiac and hepatic iron overload in patients with beta thalassemia intermediate. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 108 patients with B-TI who referred to tertiary Hospital, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. Serum ferritin, hepatic and cardiac T2 MRI were assessed. The ROC curve was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of cut-off value. Results: Serum ferritin levels showed a statistically significant negative correlation with T2 hepatic MRI (r= -0.290, P value=0.003) and positive correlation with LIC (r= 0.426, P value \u02c2 0.001) in the patients with BTI. However, T2 cardiac MRI was not significantly correlated with serum ferritin levels (P value= 0.073).According to the analysis of ROC curves, the best cut-off value for ferritin to show early diagnosis of liver iron overload was 412 ng/ml . calculated sensitivities and specificities were 0.78 and 0.82 for T2 liver MRI and 0.76 and 0.86 for liver iron concentration (LIC) respectively. Conclusion: Serum ferritin levels of 412 ng/ml might be considered as a cut-off point to evaluate hepatic iron overload before using expensive, not readily available T2 MRI. This level of serum ferritin (around 500 ng/ml) could be considered for starting iron chelation therapy in patients with B-TI in areas where T2 MRI is not available.
