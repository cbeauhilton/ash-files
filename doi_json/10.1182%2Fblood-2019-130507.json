    "abstract_text": "Background Epigenetic dysregulation is a hallmark feature of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) as epigenetic regulator genes, such as ASXL1, TET2, and SRSF2, are highly mutated in MDS patients. Tet2 (ten-eleven translocation-2, a methylcytosine deoxygenase) mutations are found in ~20% of MDS patients; they are also seen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Loss of Tet2 in hematopoietic cells leads hematopoietic defects including enhanced hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal, myeloid expansion and an increased propensity to develop MDS or AML. The lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) p300 (encoded by the EP300 gene) plays pivotal roles in essential cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation and signal transduction. However, the function of p300 in hematopoietic malignancies is clearly cell-context dependent, as we have shown that p300 functions as an oncogene in AML1-ETO-driven AML, and a tumor suppressor gene in NUP98-HOXD13-driven MDS. The EP300 and the related CREBBP genes are infrequently mutated in MDS patients. Methods To investigate the role of p300 in MDS driven by lack of Tet2, we generated a mouse model carrying a hematopoietic-specific EP300 conditional knockout on a Tet2 -null background and characterized the effect of p300 loss on HSC function and the pathogenesis of MDS and AML. We also explored the therapeutic potential of manipulating p300 KAT activity to affect the course of MDS driven by Tet2 loss. Results Compared to the Tet2 -/- mice, the EP300 \u0394/\u0394 Tet2 -/- (DKO) mice had shortened survival and an accelerated onset of AML, with increased blasts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, anemia, splenomegaly, and universal presence of granulocytic sarcomas, demonstrating that depletion of p300 enhances the leukemogenicity of Tet2 -/- HSC. The DKO mice showed enhanced hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC, defined as Lin - Sca1 + Kit + cell) proliferation and an increased HSPC pool only 2 weeks after p300 deletion, far in advance of the development of any disease manifestations. In contrast, deletion of p300 in wild type (wt) mice affected neither HSPC proliferation, nor pool size. To further define the mechanisms by which these two genetic events cooperate to drive the development of MDS/AML, we assessed the DNA methylation status and gene expression signatures of HSPCs isolated from wt, Tet2 -/- and DKO mice. As expected, loss of Tet2 leads to a genome-wide decrease in 5-hmC, whereas loss of p300 does not change 5-hmC distribution across the genome. Interestingly, DKO HSPCs showed local gains of 5-hmC at a variety of genes (compared to Tet2 -null HSPCs), including at the c-Myb gene, which is a known oncogenic driver of AML. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that p300 loss in Tet2 -/- HSPCs interferes with leukocyte differentiation, enhances proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. ChIP-X Enrichment Analysis (ChEA) further also indicated that among the differentially expressed genes, between DKO HSPCs and Tet2 -null HSPCs, are potential Myb target genes. Given this data and the RNA-Seq and Q-PCR results that showed elevated levels of Myb mRNA in the DKO HSPCs compared to the Tet2 -/- HSPCs, we examined the biological effects of knocking down (KD) Myb. Myb KD reduced the colony-forming capacity of the DKO HSPCs, but not the Tet2 -/- HSPCs, identifying its potential role in mediating the effect of p300 on MDS prone HSPCs. These results indicate that loss of p300 in Tet2 -null HSPCs enhances their leukemogenicity through elevated Myb expression and activity. To determine whether increasing p300 KAT activity could have an opposite effect on MDS cells, we utilized I-CBP112, which binds p300 and increases its KAT activity and ability to stimulate H3K18 acetylation. Exposure to I-CBP112 did in fact eliminate the indefinite self-renewal capacity of Tet2 -/- HSPCs, as measured by serial replating assays, further highlighting the importance of p300 KAT activity in regulating the behavior of Tet2 -/- HSPCs. Additional in vivo studies of the effects of I-CBP112 on the course of MDS/AML driven by the absence of Tet2 are ongoing. Conclusions This work clearly indicates that the EP300 gene can play a tumor suppressor role in MDS/AML driven by loss of Tet2 - by repressing Myb expression and activity. It also suggests that the enhancement of p300's KAT activity by use of small molecules, could be an effective therapeutic strategy for MDS/AML.
