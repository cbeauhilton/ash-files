Once clonalities are detected, the complete characterisation of Chronic Lymphoproliferative Diseases (CLPD) is supported by secondary panels chosen based on the results of CD5/CD10 expression for clonal B lymphocytes, CD27/CD38 for plasmatocytes and CD3/CD27 for clonal T cells. Materials and Methods: Blood and bone marrow of patients (N=50) with CLPD (mainly B-CLL). Samples are enumerated by haematology analyzer DxH 800 then 10 6 cells are washed three times, stained with the antibodies combination and red blood cells lysed with Versalyse (TM. Beckman Coulter). The samples were analysed on a 10 colours Navios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Fullerton, CA). The staining panel consists of 14 antibodies (CD45, CD8, CD4, CD5, CD3, CD19, CD38, \u03bb, \u03ba, CD23, CD5, CD10, CD14, CD27) conjugated with 10 different fluorochromes. The fixed gating strategy allows linking Navios analysis software to the middleware Remisol which drives the choice of the secondary panel. In some cases a third tube is performed for Ki67 or Zap-70 intra-cytoplasmic staining. Table 1 Primary panel  FITC . PE . ECD . PECy5.5 . PECy7 . APC . APC AF 700 . APC AF750 . Pacific blue .

CD8 lambda CD14 CD27 CD10 CD5 CD19 CD4 Kappa CD23 CD38 CD3 CD20 CD45 View Large Results: Monocytes are removed on the basis of their CD14/CD4 expression. B lymphocytes are CD19 positive. Normal nai\u0308ve/memory B cells, hematogones and plasma cells are defined by their CD27, CD10 and CD38 expression. Eventual monoclonality is sought by analysis of the distribution of Kappa and Lambda light chains. A first classification of B cell lymphoma is achieved with the CD5 and CD10 expression of the clone (CD5+/CD10\u2212: B-CLL MCL and few MZL, CD5\u2212/CD10\u2212: MZL and related, CD5\u2212/CD10+ DLBCL and FL). Analysis of CD27, CD20 and CD23 expression allows discriminating between CD5+/CD10- lymphomas. All the 50 samples were correctly detected as CLPD and the automated Remisol choice of the second panel fit to the final diagnosis of all the cases of this small series. T lymphocytes are defined by their CD3 and CD5 expression. The analysis of CD4/CD8 balance and CD27/CD5 distribution are first line test when T cell clonality is suspected. There is a special gating to detect CD3-CD4+ T cell lymphoma and double negativity of CD4 and CD8 is a surrogate marker for gamma/delta T cells. NK cells are mentioned as not-T not-B lymphocytes, without specific staining. Conclusion/Discussion:This 10 colours 14 antibodies panel allows describing in one tube normal T and B cells, hematogones, memory and naives B cells plasma cells and detects T and B clonalities. This panel follows a similar logic than the Euroflow LST tube but with 10 colours and with Beckman Coulter's technology and antibodies. Moreover, this combination helps discriminating rapidly the CD5+/CD10- lymphomas while the complete characterisation of CD5 negative lymphomas only require less than 6 antibodies second tube. This is a paperless (all the process is driven and controlled by Remisol), fast and inexpensive diagnostic approach (always less than 20 antibodies required).
