    "abstract_text": "Background: Despite resulting from homozygosity of a single mutation at position 6 of the beta-globin locus, the clinical aspects of sickle cell anemia (SCA) are very heterogeneous. Leg ulcer is one of the many resulting complications, exerting a quite negative impact in the quality of life of patients and is related to the severity of the disease. The pathogenesis of such complication is complex and still not well explained. Objective: Seeking for novel genes associated with leg ulcer in SCA, we proposed exome sequencing of extreme phenotypes in a sample of the Brazilian population. Methods: Our sample consisted of 40 unrelated patients with SCA from the Hematology and Hemotherapy Center of the University of Campinas (Unicamp), Campinas, SP, Brazil. The cohort was composed by 20 patients who didn't have leg ulcer, with ages varying from 40 to 61 years (it is unusual the appearance of this disorder at such age) and 20 patients with chronic leg ulcer. DNA was collected from peripheral blood leukocytes and submitted to exome sequencing. Capture and enrichment were performed with the Nextera Rapid Capture Exome kit (Illumina) and samples were loaded in the Illumina HiSeq2500. The bioinformatics process was based on the GATK Pipeline and manual filters in vcftools and excel. Briefly, we prioritized the variants according to some conditions, like score quality, depth, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and minor allele frequency greater than 0.1. Subsequently, through PLINK, we selected the variants with p value less than 0.05 from Fisher association test. The annotation was made through wAnnovar. We excluded the synonymous variants, remaining with 244 variants at this point. Finally, the deleterious variants were selected, in addition to those not classified by SIFT, PolyPhen2 and FATHMM. Twenty-one variants remained, all of them in genes beyond the usual set of a priori biological candidate genes for this phenotype. We picked up 6 variants with the lowest p values: rs4857302 ( CRYBG 3), rs3782489 ( KRT 77), rs11800462 ( TNFRSF 25), rs13428956 ( FOXD 4 L 1), rs201853154 ( UBTFL 1) and rs11454536 ( VWDE ). We suggest that these variants and their genes could potentially be related to the development of leg ulcer in SCA. However, they should all be validated in other populations for confirmation.
