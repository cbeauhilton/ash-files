    "abstract_text": "Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the most common late complication after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Its pathophysiology is poorly understood, a problem hampered by the scarcity of mouse models that accurately reproduce the human scenario. While acute (aGVHD) is characterized by donor T cell (doTC) infiltration damaging target tissues, cGVHD displays a wider range of alterations, often resulting in fibrosis with disrupted tissue architecture. Whether or not doTC drive this process versus (vs) other cell types has not yet been clarified. Indirect disruption of normal immunity caused by destruction of lymphoid tissues could contribute to the autoimmune-like syndrome. Here, we describe the progression of lymphocyte infiltrations of GVH targets post-HCT. Two MHC-matched, minor antigen-mismatched strain combinations were studied. Myeloablated BALB. B (H2b) and BALB/c (H2d) recipients were given FACS purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSC: c-Kit+Thy1.1loLin-Sca-1+) + 10^7 splenocytes (SP) from C57BL/6 (B6) (H2Db) or B10.D2 (H2d) donors, respectively. Mononuclear cells (MNC) from bone marrow (BM), spleen, lymph nodes (LN), thymus, peripheral blood, and liver were FACS analyzed for cell (sub-) type and chimerism 14, 28, 50 and 150 days (d) post-HCT. BALB.B recipients of B6 HSC + SP developed aGVHD with severe weight loss (>30%) and a mortality of 22%. Survivors never fully recovered baseline weight. Histologic changes shifted from defined infiltrates to disseminated disruptions of tissue structures. In contrast, BALB/c recipients showed sclerodermatous skin changes, but no mortality or other signs of systemic disease. In both strains the BM was markedly infiltrated with doTC during the acute phase: 14d post-HCT BALB.B BM consisted of ~50% mature doTC, and the majority (2/3) of these were CD8+ with an effector memory (EM) phenotype (CD8 TC, nai\u0308ve TC phenotypes exceeding EM, and ~40% BC. In conclusion, doTC infiltration of host organs is not inevitably associated with impairment of organ function and clinical disease. Nonspecific invasion of doTC likely occurs throughout the organism post-allogeneic HCT, and specific stimuli, such as minor antigens or cytokines are required to activate and perpetuate pathology. These data further suggest that characterizing the composition in the infiltrate in the acute setting may permit prediction of whether or not the initial infiltrates will lead to the fibrotic and sclerotic changes, the hallmarks of cGVHD.",
