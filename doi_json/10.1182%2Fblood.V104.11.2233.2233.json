    "abstract_text": "Invasive aspergillosis is still a life-threatening complication, in particular in patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Whereas prolonged neutropenia is a well established risk factor for invasive fungal disease, there is a growing body of evidence that T-cells also play an important role in the immunological response to Aspergillus species. Since invasive aspergillosis often occurs during the phase of postengraftment, which is characterized by impaired cell-mediated immunity, Aspergillus-specific T-cells could be a potential therapeutic target in these patients. We therefore analyzed in a first step the response of T-cells to several potential antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus by means of 3 H-thymidine incorporation assay. In order to generate Aspergillus-specific T-cells, the antigens with the highest proliferation indices (EC-SAB and 90 kDa catalase) were used to stimulate 1.0 x 10 8 mononuclear cells from healthy donors. The activated T-cells were isolated on the following day using the IFN-\u03b3 secretion assay (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) and then expanded for 14 days. Intracellular cytokine analysis of EC-SAB generated cell lines (n=7) revealed a significant IFN-\u03b3 secretion by 13.6%\u00b12.3 of CD4 + cells (seven out of seven tested cell lines) and an Aspergillus-specific IL-2 secretion by 6.5%\u00b11.9 of CD4 + cells (three out of three tested cell lines), which supports the T H 1 response of the generated cells to Aspergillus antigen. In contrast to EC-SAB generated T-cell populations, all three cell lines which were generated with 90 kDa catalase were not informative. Further analysis showed that restimulation with EC-SAB induced a strong proliferation of EC-SAB generated T-cell populations (all three populations tested), whereas alloreactivity was unaffected. The number of these cells could be expanded within 14 days up to 20fold using OKT-3, IL-2 and feeder cells. Currently, we investigate the impact of these Aspergillus-specific cell populations in the defense to different species of Aspergillus. Our preliminary results suggest that Aspergillus-specific T-cells could be an interesting option in prophylaxis and therapy of invasive aspergillosis in patients undergoing HSCT.",
