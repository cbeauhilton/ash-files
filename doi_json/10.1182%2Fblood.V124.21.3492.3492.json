    "abstract_text": "Pancytopenia is the most prominent clinical finding in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and represents a major cause for morbidity and mortality. So far, the underlying mechanisms leading to hematopoietic insufficiency in AML are poorly understood and therefore often mechanistically summarized as marrow replacement by infiltrating leukemic cells. Mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPC) are integral components of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment and play an indispensable role for the regulation of normal hematopoiesis. Two AML mouse models have recently shown, that expansion of the leukemic clone leads to numeric changes and functional disturbances of niche components such as MSPC and osteoblasts, resulting in insufficient hematopoietic support (Hanoun et al. 2014; Frisch et al. 2012). As the knowledge about MSPC in human AML is limited so far, we conducted a detailed analysis of AML-derived MSPC in order to elucidate their contribution to hematopoietic failure. For this purpose we investigated the molecular and functional properties of BM-derived MSPC of 46 patients with AML covering all relevant subtypes according to WHO classification at diagnosis and/or during course of disease and compared them with MSPC functions of healthy controls. Hematopoietic insufficiency in the 31 patients at diagnosis was mirrored by 76% of the patients having bi- or pancytopenia and by median ANC of 1183/\u03bcl, median hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dl, and median platelet count of 67.000/\u03bcl. MSPC of these newly diagnosed patients exhibited significantly impaired growth capacities as shown by an altered morphology, reduced CFU-F activity, a lower number of passages and cumulative population doublings. While adipogenic differentiation potential was not affected, osteogenic differentiation potential of AML-derived MSPC was significantly reduced as indicated by cytochemical stainings, reduced Osterix and Osteocalcin (OC) mRNA levels as well as OC serum levels. Furthermore we detected altered mRNA and/or protein expression of key molecules involved in the regulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), namely SCF, Angiopoietin-1, Jagged1 and Osteopontin. Functionally, this translated into a significantly diminished ability of AML-derived MSPC to support healthy CD34+ HSPC in LTC-IC assays. This insufficient stromal support was reversible and correlated with disease status, as LTC-IC frequency returned to normal values in patients in remission, but remained low in patients with refractory disease. Along with this we also observed a significant increase of OC serum levels in patients, who achieved complete remission. These data clearly suggests a direct causal relationship between the presence of leukemic cells and MSPC functionality. In further support of this idea we observed reduced proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of healthy MSPC following cultivation in conditioned media (CM) of 4 AML cell lines (THP-1, HL-60, MV4-11, MOLM-13). A comparable inhibitory effect of AML cells on healthy MSPC growth was seen in transwell-assays arguing in favor for a cell-contact independent mechanism. In summary, our data show that AML-derived MSPC are structurally and functionally altered resulting in an insufficient stromal support for normal hematopoiesis in AML. The correlation between clinical remission status and stromal support function together with the finding, that healthy MSC can adopt an AML-like phenotype when exposed to AML-CM suggest an instructive role of the leukemic precursor cells.
