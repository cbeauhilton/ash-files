    "abstract_text": "Objective: To study the mechanism of proliferation inhibition and apoptosis of MDS-RAEB MUTZ-1 cells by 2-methoxyestradiol(2-ME). Methods: MUTZ-1 cells were treated with different concentrations of 2-ME;cellular proliferation was determined by MTT assay;apoptosis rate was determined with annexinV-FITC/PI double staining and cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM);the changes of morphologic features of MUTZ-1 cells were investigated by cytomorphology with Wright-Giemsa\u2019s staining; lactate dehydrogenises (LD) was determined by Beckman Counter and agarose gel electrophoresis was used to verify whether 2-ME could induce apoptosis in MUTZ-1 cells. Moreover, the activity of telomerase in MUTZ-1 cells was examined by TRAP-ELISA. Results: The results showed that 1\u223c4\u03bcmol/L 2-ME inhibited the proliferation of MUTZ-1 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner; the typical apoptotic morphological features appeared in MUTZ-1 cells after being treated with 4\u03bcmol/L 2-ME for 12hours; the marked DNA ladder pattern of internucleosomal fragmentation was observed after being treated with 4\u03bcmol/L 2-ME for 24hours and the up-regulated production of LD was assayed after treatment of 2-ME for 36hours. The number of MUTZ-1 cells of G 0 /G 1 phase and S phase decreased, while the number of G 2 /M phase increased after MUTZ-1 cells were incubated with 1,2 and 4\u03bcmol/L2-ME for 12 hours, respectively( P <0.05). The inhibition effect of telomerase activity was enhanced in a dose- and time- dependent manner. Moreover, telomerase activity was significant negatively correlated with increased apoptosis ( r =\u22120.954, p =0.046) and the number of sustained G 2 /M phase( r =\u22120.979, p =0.021) at the corresponding time point, respectively. Conclusions :It is concluded that the mechanism of proliferation inhibition and apoptosis of MUTZ-1 cells induced by 2-ME is probably related with inhibition of telomerase activity and G 2 /M cell cycle arrest; 2-ME may be a potentially useful, adjunctive anticancer drug in treating myelodysplastic syndrome.",
