    "abstract_text": "Background : Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy that remains incurable. The identification of CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein overexpressed on MM cells, led to the development of target-specific therapeutics such as the FDA approved monoclonal antibody (mAb) Daratumumab (DARA). Although a valuable treatment option for refractory/relapsed (R/R) MM patients, DARA has a limited response rate of below 50%, which highlights the clinical need for novel therapeutics. Aims : Aiming to further exploit the therapeutic potential of CD38 in the MM setting, immunotherapies based on the novel anti-CD38 mAb CD38A2 were tested. Methods : For the first approach, the CD38A2 mAb -that binds to a unique, distinct from DARA's, CD38 epitope- was conjugated with either the alkylating agent Duomycin (ADC-136) or the microtubulin binder Duostatin (ADC-129). The ADCs were compared to DARA, in cultures of primary MM cells from patients refractory to DARA treatment. In a second approach, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) consisting of the CD38A2 scFv and the intracellular domains of CD28 and CD3\u03b6 was used to transduce primary T and NK cells from R/R MM patients. The functionality of the CAR-T and CAR-NK cells was assessed in cytotoxicity assays against autologous myeloma cells. Results : ADC-136 demonstrated the most potent cytotoxicity against the MM cells with an IC50 of 6pM at day 6 following a single dose treatment. ADC-129 showed cell killing with an IC50 of 30pM, while DARA did not exhibit appreciable cytotoxicity. Regarding the cell therapy approach, patients' T and NK cells were effectively transduced, showing a CD38A2-CAR expression ranging between 11-68%. In functional assays, CAR-T and CAR-NK cells were assayed against autologous myeloma cells, where they exhibited an increase in target cell cytotoxicity, compared to the untransduced cells. Summary/Conclusion : Altogether, our preliminary findings demonstrate that CD38 targeting using CD38A2-based immunotherapies could be a viable therapeutic approach in R/R MM patients previously exposed to DARA. Currently, an anti-CD38 CAR-T therapy based on CD38A2 is being evaluated in Phase 1 studies in R/R MM patients by Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.
