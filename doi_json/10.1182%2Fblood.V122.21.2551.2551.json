    "abstract_text": "Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) is a key regulator of cell metabolism, proliferation, survival, and differentiation. The kinase has abundant substrates including many proteins in the canonical WNT pathway. Considering that GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation of many pro-survival proteins result in their degradation (e.g MYC, MCL-1), it is not surprising that GSK3\u03b2 activation by stress challenge leads to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. GSK3\u03b2 is negatively regulated by serine 9 phosphorylation mediated by Protein Kinase B (AKT). Since AKT activation supports survival of AML cells and inactivation of GSK3\u03b2 could suppress stress signaling events, we hypothesize that serine 9 phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 (p-GSK3\u03b2 ) will be detrimental for AML patients. In the current study, we analyzed GSK3\u03b2 expression by Reverse Phase Protein Analysis (RPPA) in a cohort of 511 AML patients. GSK3\u03b2 expression was correlated with patient survival data and disease characteristics such as French-American-British (FAB) classification, cytogenetics, and mutational status. High levels of p-GSK3\u03b2 were found to correlate with adverse outcome for survival and complete remission duration (CR) in patients with intermediate cytogenetics but not in those with unfavorable cytogenetics. CR was only 45 weeks in the third of patients with highest p-GSK3\u03b2 levels compared to 98 weeks for patients with low levels (p = 0.008; N = 121). Even intermediate cytogenetic patients with FLT3 mutation fared better when p-GSK3\u03b2 levels were lower (50 versus 24 weeks; p = 0.009; N = 35). Expression of GSK3\u03b2 and its phosphorylated form was compared with expression of 229 other proteins using RPPA in the AML patient cohort. Consistent with p-GSK3\u03b2 as an indicator of AKT activation, RPPA revealed that p-GSK3\u03b2 is positively correlated with phosphorylation of AKT (S473), BAD (S136), and P70S6K. In addition, p-GSK3\u03b2 negatively correlated with FOXO3A (which is degraded after phosphorylation by AKT). Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM MSCs) are a critical component of the leukemic microenvironment but how these cells modulate the survival of leukemia cells is not clear. RPPA analysis was performed on BM MSC from healthy donor (N = 71) and BM MSCs from AML patients (N = 106). Interestingly, both total and phosphorylated GSK3 were found to be elevated in the AML samples suggesting that AKT is also activated in the leukemic MSCs. In vitro models of the BM microenvironment suggest that the AKT pathway is activated in both the leukemic and supporting stromal cells so this finding is consistent with these models (Konopleva and Andreeff, Curr Drug Targets. 2007; 8: 685). Unlike in AML blast cells, FOXO3A was not correlated with GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation in the MSCs. Examination of miRs in normal versus AML BM MSCs using microarray analysis and validated by qRT-PCR indicate that miR-21 is elevated in the MSC of the normal individuals. As miR-21 is suppressed by FOXO3A, this finding supports the notion that AKT is active in the AML BM MSCs but FOXO3A may not be functional. This possibility is plausible as induction of FOXO3A results in apoptosis in MSC (Djouad Cloning Stem Cells. 2009; 11:407). Conclusion These findings suggest that AKT mediated phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 may be detrimental to AML patients and p-GSK3\u03b2 may serve as an important prognostic factor for at least a subset of AML patients. The results also suggest that activation of AKT can occur in both the malignant cells and MSC cells in the leukemic microenvironment. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
