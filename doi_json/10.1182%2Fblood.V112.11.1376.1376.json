    "abstract_text": "The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor TAL1/SCL plays a critical role in hematopoiesis and vascular remodeling. A mouse Tal1 cDNA was first cloned from a bone marrow (BM) macrophage cDNA library, and we and others observed expression ofTal1 protein by BM mononuclear cells. To characterize Tal1 expression during monocyte/macrophage differentiation, we isolated common myeloid precursors (CMPs) from BM of 3-5 week old C57BL/6J mice and induced them to terminally differentiate according to a published method ( Genes & Dev. , 16 : 1721 , 2002 ). Using real-time PCR analysis,Tal1 mRNA was expressed in a biphasic pattern from CMP to post-mitotic macrophage, including lipopolysaccharide- and interferon-a\u0303-activated macrophages. To elucidate Tal1\u2019sfunctions in murine monocytopoiesis we deleted the Tal1 gene in murine BM monocytes and monocytic precursors in culture. To that end, C57BL/6 mice with loxP sequences flanking the third coding exon of Tal1 were bred with C57BL/6 mice with a lacZ gene replacing Tal1 coding exons 1, 2, and 3. Tal1 fl/fl /lacZ progeny were identified by PCR genotyping, and BM mononuclear cells were cultured with mouse interleukin-3 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). To render the cells Tal1 -null, Cre coding sequences were introduced with the MSCV-GFP retroviral vector and GFP-positive cells were then sorted and cultured with M-CSF alone. Real-time PCR analysis showed near-total abolition of Tal1 mRNA expression in Cre-transduced relative to vector-transduced cells. Gene expression analysis for other transcripts showed an approximately 4-foldreduction in Gata2 expression over the same culture period but no difference in Aml1 , PU.1 , Csfr1 , Msr1 (mouse scavenger receptor), Cd68 , or Il6ra . Biologically, the most significant effect of Tal1 knockout was on cell number, which increased by 80% in control cells but not at all in Tal1-null cells. Transduction of wild-type BM monocytes with MSCV-GFP-Cre (or the parental MSCV-GFP) vector had no effect on cell proliferation, precluding any nonspecific or toxic effect of Cre (or retroviral infection) in this cell type. Dye dilution analysis of virus-transduced cells with the fluorescent membrane-intercalating dye PKH26 revealed a delay and absolute reduction in proliferation of Tal1-null compared to control cells. In contrast, little or no difference was noted in annexin V staining of Tal1 -null compared to heterozygous knockout (knock-in) cells, indicating a lack of effect on apoptosis. Finally, serial analysis of CD31 and Ly6c expression in differentiating Tal1 hemizygous and nullizygous BM monocytes showed that loss of Tal1 caused a slight acceleration in terminal monocyte-macrophage differentiation. In summary, these studies confirm our earlier finding that the Tal1 gene is expressed in differentiating mouse BMmonocytes. In addition, they reveal a novel function of this bHLH transcription factor in proliferation of murine monocyte/macrophage precursors. Finally, they place Tal1upstream of Gata2 in cells of this lineage.",
