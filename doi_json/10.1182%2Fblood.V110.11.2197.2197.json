    "abstract_text": "Mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) are critical in health to maintain tissue homeostasis and in disease as major effectors of innate immunity. In the adult, MNPs develop from bone marrow (BM) progenitors that differentiate to monocytes, tissue macrophages (M\u03d5s), and specialized cells (dendritic cells, microglia and osteoclasts). Colony Stimulating Factor-1 (CSF-1) acts through the CSF-1R to regulate proliferation, survival and differentiation of MNPs. GAB2, a member of the GAB family of scaffolding proteins (GAB1-3), modulates and amplifies signals from numerous receptors, through recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Shp2 phosphatase. Knockdown studies in the 32D myeloid cell line from our lab showed that GAB2 is required for CSF-1 induced mitogenesis and activation of Akt, a PI3K effector. To test the hypothesis that the GAB2-PI3K axis is important for MNP development in vivo, we examined M\u03d5 development in GAB2 +/+ and \u2212/\u2212 mice (gift of Josef Penninger). GAB2 is upregulated 14-fold during CSF-1-induced differentiation of primary BM cells from GAB2+/+ mice. A significant difference is detected in the steady state percentage of F4/80+ BM cells (F4/80 is a mature M\u03d5 marker): 17.5 \u00b1 1.6 (GAB2+/+, n=8) vs. 11.4 \u00b1 1.6 (GAB2\u2013/\u2212, n=6) (p=0.025, 2-sided t-test). Using the CFU-C progenitor assay with CSF-1 as the only growth factor, primary BM cells from GAB2 \u2212/\u2212 mice show a striking 7-fold reduction in colony numbers compared to those from GAB2 +/+ mice (p=0.004) and the colonies were much smaller. Thus GAB2 is essential for optimal CSF-1-dependent M\u03d5 colony formation. We then used CD31 and Ly6C and flow cytometry to follow the kinetics of M\u03d5 formation during BM differentiation. These markers monitor sequential stages of M\u03d5 development: CD31 high Ly6C\u2013 -> CD31+Ly6C+ -> CD31-Ly6C high ( Eur. J. Immunol.  24 : 2279 ). As early as 2 days after differentiation induction, GAB2\u2212/\u2212 BM cells show a 2-fold reduction in the CD31+Ly6C+ subset (p=6\u00d710 \u22126 ) and a 6-fold increase in the CD31-Ly6C high subset (p=1\u00d710 \u22124 ), indicating that in the absence of GAB2, CSF-1 promotes a smaller increase in myeloid progenitors and an earlier appearance of more mature cells. To assess proliferation in the progenitor population, day 2 BM cells were labeled with CFSE. Consistent with decreased cell division during early stages of M\u03d5 development in the absence of GAB2, we observed a 66% reduction in CFSE intensity in GAB2+/+ compared to \u2212/\u2212 cells after 3 days in culture. A 2-fold reduction in proliferation by the MTS assay is similarly observed during late M\u03d5 development (days 5-7) (p=10 \u22124 ). No difference in viability or expression of CSF-1R or CD11b is found in day 7 M\u03d5s from GAB2+/+ and \u2212/\u2212 mice, excluding increased cell death or arrested differentiation as causes. To investigate the role of GAB2-PI3K, we transduced BM cells with viruses expressing WT-GAB2, 3YF-GAB2 (defective in PI3K binding), both in MSCV-IRES-GFP, or empty MSCV. WT- and 3YF-GAB2 expression in GAB2\u2212/\u2212 cells increase the numbers of CFU-Cs by 5- and 2-fold respectively and by 8- and 2.4-fold in GFP+ colonies \u2265 500 \u03bc. Conversely, 3YF-GAB2 exerts a dominant-negative effect on GAB2+/+ cells (a decrease of 30% and 76% in unsorted cells and GFP+ colonies \u2265 500 \u03bc respectively). Therefore PI3K recruitment by GAB2 is required for CSF-1-induced M\u03d5 colony formation but other GAB2 effector pathways are also important. Our findings support the conclusion that GAB2 is crucial for CSF-1 mediated M\u03d5 development in the BM, by regulating monocyte/M\u03d5 progenitor expansion and M\u03d5 proliferation, in part through PI3K."
