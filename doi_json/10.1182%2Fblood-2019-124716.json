    "abstract_text": "Background: Achieving sustained DMR (variably described as \u2265 MR 4 or \u2265 MR 4.5 ) is an emerging treatment goal for patients with CML. DMR is associated with excellent long-term clinical outcomes and a higher likelihood of successful treatment-free remission (TFR) upon discontinuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Biological predictors of patients likely to achieve DMR are unknown. Here, we present an exploratory analysis of gene expression signatures in order to predict DMR to TKI therapy, as well as understand the biological underpinnings that allow a DMR, based on patients treated with imatinib or nilotinib in the ENESTnd study (NCT00471497). Methods: ENESTnd is a phase 3, randomized, open-label study comparing nilotinib 300 mg twice daily (BID), nilotinib 400 mg BID and imatinib 400 mg once daily (QD) in patients with newly-diagnosed CML. To maximize the likelihood of defining predictive and biologically relevant gene signatures, samples from a group of poor responders ( BCR-ABL1 IS > 10% by 3 months of therapy) and good responders ( BCR-ABL1 IS < 0.01% by 12 months of therapy) were selected across all treatment arms. Whole blood samples collected prior to study treatment initiation were available from 112 such patients from the total 846 patients enrolled in ENESTnd, and were subjected to RNA sequencing. DMR was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction transcript ratios standardized to the international scale (IS) and was defined as BCR-ABL IS \u2264 0.01% (MR 4 ) or \u2264 0.0032% (MR 4.5 ). For statistical analysis, responders were defined as patients having achieved DMR by 5 years, whereas non-responders were in the trial for \u2265 5 years without achieving DMR. Five years was selected to ensure that patients on both imatinib and nilotinib arms had adequate time to reach MR 4.5 . The association of clinical variables with responder status (good or poor) was assessed via a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: We correlated clinical variables (eg, Sokal risk score, TKI, age, sex) with responder status for 112 ENESTnd study patients who received 400 mg imatinib QD (n = 47), 300 mg nilotinib BID (n = 33), or 400 mg nilotinib BID (n = 32). Of the 112 patient samples, 70 were included in the analysis using MR 4.5 as an endpoint, with 47 patients characterized as responders (imatinib: 16; nilotinib: 31), and 23 as non-responders (imatinib: 13; nilotinib: 10). Of the 112 samples, 42 were excluded from analysis because the patients discontinued the trial before 5 years and did not achieve MR 4.5 (imatinib: 18; nilotinib: 24). Younger age (< 35 years) was associated with good response (p < 0.02) in a multivariate analysis. We developed a predictive model of responder status by applying penalized regression to clinical variables and gene expression (13569 genes) in independent (clinical or gene expression) and combined gene and clinical models. The best performing model used patients with MR 4.5 vs poor responders, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.87 (Figure; Table). Including clinical variables did not result in markedly different performance (AUC = 0.85). Significantly, both models outperformed a model that included clinical variables only (AUC = 0.65). Relaxing the definition of good responders to include patients with MR 4 yielded similar results (Table). Detailed biomarker/pathway analysis to explore the biological pathways that separate good and poor response are underway. Conclusions: We present a gene expression model that distinguishes patients who achieved a DMR from those with a poor response to treatment at 5 years. The approach for sample selection optimized the chances of finding a biological and clinical signal and may be applicable to all CML patients initiating TKI therapy. This work could yield new therapeutic targets that could potentially turn a patient biologically determined to be a poor responder into a good responder who might even achieve a TFR.
