    "abstract_text": "Background: Adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) suffer poor quality, disparities, higher utilization and mortality, and unmet medical need. Thus, in 2017 Virginia Commonwealth University Health (VCU) used pilot results and axioms of the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) and Lean Six Sigma quality improvement to build an Adult SCD Medical Home. Methods and Results: VCU funded the program in October 2017. We implemented it over the next fifteen months. We first used a Six Sigma QI cycle called DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control). Define: we defined three improvement targets in year one: inpatient, emergency department (ED), and ambulatory care. Behavioral health, program evaluation, ambulatory clinical policies, and pediatric to adult transition were added in year two. We identified ourselves or recruited hospital partners as champions/leaders for each care target area. Each formed a multidisciplinary implementation team. The inpatient care team actually preceded Medical Home funding. Where feasible, each team conducted PDSA cycles to test and improve best practices or metrics. Measure: we ranked 567 adult SCD patients based on their CY 2017 30-day readmissions, length of stay, 3-day ED returns, ED discharges, inpatient days and discharges, outpatient visits, ED use, and charges. Each team also developed metrics. Analyze: The top 50 highest utilizers by charges were targeted for intervention. Improve: We aimed for six 12-month intervention patient results: 1) reduce readmissions by 15%; 2) reduce average length of stay by 1.5 days; 3) reduce charges by 15%; 4) improve compliance with SCD inpatient guidelines; 5) improve quality, safety, and financial reporting; 6) improve patient experience. Leaders also used Six Sigma tools weekly to oversee teams, identify resources, plan, and hire staff: for example, we ranked the urgency of steps using \"Now, Later, Latest\" process charts, and documented progress using \"Quick Wins\" communication logs. Control: Processes were continuously amended. Stakeholders met and supported us monthly to quarterly. We distributed an annual report. Metric results are presented in a separate abstract. Conclusion: Lean Six Sigma QI principles were effective for developing and implementing an adult SCD medical home. We believe the above processes could be replicated elsewhere.
