    "abstract_text": "Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is a malignant lymphoid neoplasia that shows aberrant expression of cytokines, including IL-10 and TNF-a. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding IL-10 and TNF-a or their regulatory proteins, such as NFkB, may impact cHL pathobiology. In this study, SNPs in the promoter regions of genes encoding for IL-10 (SNP/pIL-10 -592, rs1800872; and SNP/pIL-10 -1082, rs1800896), and TNF-a (SNP/pTNF-a -238, rs361525; and SNP/pTNF-a -862, rs1800630), as well as in the intronic region of the NFkB1 gene (SNP/iNFkB1, rs1585215) were genotyped in 73 patients with cHL and evaluated against clinical and laboratory prognostic parameters for the disease. SNPs/pIL-10 AA were significantly associated with higher leukocyte and lower lymphocyte counts at diagnosis. In case of TNF-a, SNP/pTNF-a -238 AG was associated with EBV infection while SNP/pTNF-a -862 CC presented more frequently with leukocytosis. SNP/iNFkB1 AA generally had stage IV and extranodal disease at diagnosis. Nonetheless, none of the studied SNPs had effect on treatment outcome. This study shows that some SNPs genotypes for IL-10 and TNF-a genes are associated with prognostic parameters in cHL; furthermore, this is the first time that the SNP/iNFkB1 (rs1585215) was implicated in clinical features of the disease.
