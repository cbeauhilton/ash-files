    "abstract_text": "Although the clinical importance of aberrant Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling has been recognized in various cancers, including MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (MLL AML), its key tractable pathway components have not yet been discovered in leukemic stem cells (LSC). Our studies have identified an Rspo3/Wnt3a-Lgr4-Gnaq pathway, which significantly potentiates \u03b2-catenin signaling in MLL LSC. Genetic and pharmacological targeting of this pathway impairs LSC self-renewal and survival, inhibiting MLL-AF9-induced leukemia progression in vivo . Gene expression analysis of AML patient samples ( Nucleic Acids Res , 41:D1034-9, 2013) revealed an approximately 3-fold increase ( p =0.00002) in expression of leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 4 (Lgr4) in leukemic cells from patients with MLL AML compared to normal human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). As recent studies have highlighted a critical link between R-spondin (Rspo)/Lgr4 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathways, we hypothesized that up-regulation of Lgr4 is associated with aberrant activation of \u03b2-catenin signaling in MLL LSC. We have previously demonstrated that \u03b2-catenin is highly expressed in HSC transformed by MLL-AF9 and is lower in HSC transduced with leukemic oncogenes such as Hoxa9/Meis1, while increased \u03b2-catenin expression is correlated with a poor survival rate in mice. In this study, western blots confirmed high levels of Lgr4 expression in HSC expressing MLL-AF9 compared to Hoxa9/Meis1. ShRNA-mediated stable knockdown of Lgr4 markedly reduced colony formation of HSC expressing MLL-AF9 by 55-65% ( p =0.0001) and significantly prolonged mouse survival ( p =0.0019) through its inhibition of endogenous \u03b2-catenin expression. This deficient phenotype could be rescued by expression of a constitutively active form of \u03b2-catenin. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Lgr4 alone was not sufficient for triggering the leukemic transformation of HSC but conferred a growth advantage in vivo to HSC expressing Hoxa9/Meis1 and significantly accelerated the onset of Hoxa9/Meis1-induced AML in mice ( p =0.0011). These data support an oncogenic role of Lgr4 in promoting tumor formation through activation of \u03b2-catenin signaling. As Lgr4 has recently been identified as a receptor for the Rspo family of secreted proteins (Rspo1\u2013Rspo4), we sought to determine if Rspo is a positive regulator of \u03b2-catenin signaling in MLL AML. We found that only the combination of Rspo3 and Wnt3a potently enhanced \u03b2-catenin signaling in HSC expressing MLL-AF9 whereas Rspo and Wnt3a alone or the combination of Wnt3a with other Rspo had no effects on \u03b2-catenin activity. Depletion of Lgr4 completely abolished Rspo3/Wnt3a-induced \u03b2-catenin signaling, suggesting Rspo3/Wnt3a potentiating \u03b2-catenin signaling through Lgr4. Next, we assessed if Lgr4 signals through G protein pathways. By testing G protein alpha inhibitors in MLL LSC, we demonstrated that G protein alpha-q (Gnaq) was required for maintenance of stem cell properties by chemical suppression of the Gnaq-activated \u03b2-catenin pathway with a Gnaq selective inhibitor, which exhibited a 3-fold decrease in colony formation ( p =0.0001) and a 4-fold reduction in cell number ( p =0.0009), and was sufficient to induce substantial cell differentiation and apoptosis. Treatment with Gnaq inhibitor abolished the effect of Lgr4 on \u03b2-catenin transactivation, implicating an Lgr4-Gnaq-\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in MLL LSC. Microarray analysis of gene expression confirmed enrichment of genes related to cancer cell proliferation, migration and growth, as well as enrichment of Wnt target genes in LSC expressing Lgr4. Taken together, we report here an Rspo3/Wnt3a-Lgr4-Gnaq-\u03b2-catenin signaling circuit in MLL leukemogenesis. Interference with components of the circuit can block \u03b2-catenin signaling and perturb leukemia development. Thus, our findings provide potential therapeutic targets in treating LSC-based hematological malignancy driven by Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling.
