    "abstract_text": "Introduction Multiple myeloma (MM), relapsed or refractory (R/R) to standard of care therapies, represents a treatment indication with a significant unmet clinical need. Transcriptional activation of c-MYC through bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins contributes to the malignant phenotype of the disease. RO is a novel thienodiazepine, small molecule, non-covalent inhibitor of the BET family of bromodomains. Preclinical studies with BET inhibitors have demonstrated significant single agent in vivo activity in myeloma, accompanied by down-regulation of MYC and MYC target gene expression. We report results of a monotherapy phase 1b study of RO in R/R MM (NCT03068351). Methods Eligible pts with R/R MM included those treated with at least three prior lines of multiple myeloma therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, or who are double-refractory to a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent. Primary refractory myeloma pts were only allowed in the dose escalation portion of the study. In the dose escalation (part I), pts received subcutaneous (SC) escalating doses of RO (0.30-0.65 mg/kg) in a standard 3 + 3 design on days 1 - 14 of 21-day cycles to determine both the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD). In the expansion cohort (part II), pts received RO as monotherapy at the RD level. Primary endpoint was safety (DLT, MTD, RD) and secondary endpoints included evaluation of pharmacodynamics (CD11b expression) and preliminary efficacy assessments based on IMWG criteria. Results Between June 2017 and April 2019, a total of 24 pts were enrolled in the US, the UK and Australia. 13 pts were enrolled in the dose escalation and 11 pts in the expansion part. The median age of pts was 65.5 years (range: 46 - 82 years). The study population was heavily pretreated with a median of 6 (3-9) prior therapies. Pts were refractory to immunomodulatory drugs (63%), proteasome inhibitors (46%), both (46%), or daratumumab (42%). 57 total cycles were administered, with a median of 2 (1-6) cycles per patient (pt). Two DLTs occurred in one pt in the 0.65 mg/kg cohort (thrombocytopenia grade 4, angina pectoris grade 3). The recommended dose is 0.65 mg/kg. Grade 3 treatment emergent AEs in \u2265 5% of pts were thrombocytopenia (11 pts [45.8%]), anemia (7 pts [29.2%]), fatigue (3 pts [12.5%]), injection site reaction, malaise, decreased appetite, and hyponatremia (2 pts [8.3%] each). 3 pts (12.5%) experienced a total of 4 AEs leading to discontinuation of the study treatment; these AEs were left ventricular dysfunction, fatigue, sepsis, and staphylococcal bacteremia (the latter two AEs occurred in the same pt). A total of 8 deaths (33.3%) were reported in the study, all as a consequence of progressive disease. The best overall response recorded was partial response in 4 pts (16.7 %), 3 of whom having received prior daratumumab. One pt experienced a minimal response, and stable disease was reported in 12 out of 24 (50%). There was no evidence for a dose-related increase in efficacy, though data are very limited ( Table ). Responses obtained during treatment with RO6870810 were short-lived and lasted for appr. 6 weeks. As evidence of target engagement, pharmacodynamic profiling demonstrated decreases in CD11b levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( Figure ). Conclusions Treatment of MM pts with the BET inhibitor RO as monotherapy resulted in a high incidence of cytopenias, especially grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 anemia. However, none of these events led to study drug discontinuation. Cytopenias are a known side effect of BET inhibitors, with thrombocytopenia frequently reported as a DLT in various pt populations. Pts with NUT carcinoma, other solid tumors, or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated in the First in Man trial of RO had a low rate of cytopenias, indicating that the underlying disease and the extensive pre-treatment in MM may play a role in their occurrence (publication submitted). In this heavily pretreated R/R MM population, we have established 0.65 mg/kg as the recommended monotherapy dose. Pharmacodynamics effects were evident at this dose, but as monotherapy in this R/R MM cohort, response rates were low and less durable. Future drug combination approaches may result in an improved benefit / risk ratio.
