    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3423 Poster Board III-311 Long term survival for patients with chemo-refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is poor even with high dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Strategies such as novel transplant conditioning regimens and post transplant maintenance therapy are being evaluated to improve outcomes. Herein we report on the results of a phase II study designed to assess the impact of a novel radioimmunotherapy (RIT) based conditioning regimen of Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in conjunction with high dose BEAM (BCNU, Etoposide, Ara\u2013C, Melphalan) in patients with poor risk NHL. Between May 2002 and Jan 2009, 31 patients who were either primary induction failure (n=18) or in partial remission (n=13) underwent HDC with Y 90 plus BEAM. Patients received an imaging dose of Indium 111 on day -21 followed by a treatment dose of Y 90 (0.4mCi/kg) on day-14. HDC with BEAM was started on day -7. The median age at ASCT was 57 (range: 19\u201370). The majority of patients were male (n=23, 74%) and had advanced stage disease (III or IV) at the time of diagnosis, (n=23, 74%). The histologies included Follicular n=6, Diffuse Large B-cell n=13, Mantle cell n=8, and Transformed n=4. The median number of prior regimens was 2 (range: 1-5). All patients engrafted at a median of 11 days. At the time of analysis, 23 (74%) patients were alive, and eight had expired (seven due to relapse/progressive disease, one due to COPD). The non-relapse mortality was 3.2%. The median length of follow-up for surviving patients is 46.9 months (range: 3.3-75.0). The two-year overall survival and disease-free survival was 77.9% (95%CI: 62.7-87.6%) and 50.9% (95%CI: 40.5-60.3%) respectively for the entire cohort. However, the relapse rate in the subset of MCL pts was strikingly high and approached 80% at 4 yrs. The other subgroups had a stable DFS (figure 1). In conclusion in this poor risk group of patients Y 90 plus high dose BEAM can induce responses and long term remissions, however, for patients with chemorefractory MCL other treatment approaches may be warranted.
