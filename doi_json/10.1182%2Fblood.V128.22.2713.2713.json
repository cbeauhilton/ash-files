    "abstract_text": "Background : Dynamin-2 (DNM2) is a GTPase essential for intracellular vesicle formation and trafficking, cytokinesis and receptor endocytosis. Mutations in DNM2 are common in early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, DNM2 expression in other types of ALL is not reported. Ikaros, encoded by IKZF1 , is a transcriptor factor functioned as a tumor suppress gene, and its dysfunction is associated with poor survival and high relapse rate in ALL. Casein Kinase II (CK2) inhibition could restore Ikaros function in high-risk leukemia and CK2 inhibitor-CX4945 showed the therapeutic efficacy on high-risk leukemia with human-derived xenograft mouse model. It is still undetermined if Ikaros regulates DNM2 expression in the leukemic cells. Methods : The 151 patients' and 30 volunteers' BM samples were collected between June 2008 and June 2014 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. The ALL diagnosis was made according to the morphologic, Immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular criteria of WHO Diagnosis and Classification of ALL (2008).Cytogenetic and molecular analyses as previously reported. The DNM2 expression was determined by qPCR in the patients. All the patients were divided into high or low DNM2 expression groups (Q4 vs Q1-3) and the cutoff was determined by SPSS 17.0. For quantitative parameters, overall differences between the cohorts were evaluated using a Mann - Whitney U -test. For qualitative parameters, overall group differences were analyzed using a \u03c72 test. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 17.0 and P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The effect of Ikaros on DNM2 gene expression was observed by qPCR in the leukemic cells expressed Ikaros or Ikaros ShRNA. Ikaros binding with promoter of DNM2 was evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay following quantitative real-time PCR in leukemic cells. The effect of DNM2 inhibitor on cell proliferation was performed by WST-1 cell proliferation assay, and the synergy of Casein Kinase inhibitor which restores Ikaros function with DNM2 inhibitor on cell proliferation of leukemic cells was analyzed by CalcuSyn. Results : We studied DNM2 mRNA level in adults with B- and T-cell ALL, and found DNM2 is more highly expressed compared with normals in both forms of ALL. High DNM2 expression is significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS), high relapse rate, and leukaemia cell proliferation markers particularly in B-ALL. DNM2 expression is significantly higher in the patients with IKZF1 deletion compared to that of without deletion. Ikaros directly binds the DNM2 promoter in Nalm6 (B-ALL) and CEM (T-ALL) leukemic cells. Ikaros suppresses the transcription of DNM2 with luciferase reporter assay. Retroviral transduction of Ikaros results in the down-regulation of DNM2 in the leukemic cells. CK2 inhibitor, TBB increases Ikaros binding to promoter of DNM2 and suppresses DNM2 expression in an Ikaros-dependent manner in both leukemic cell lines and primary cells. TBB induced-increase of H3K9me3 binding on the promoter of DNM2 was also observed in leukemic cell lines and primary cells. Finally, DNM2 inhibitor-MiTMAB significantly suppresses the cell proliferation of Nalm6 and CEM cells with the WST-1 cell proliferation assay and has significantly synergistic effect with Ck2 inhibitor, CX-4945 in the cells. Conclusion : High DNM2 expression is associated with Ikaros dys-regulation, revealing their potential roles on the development of ALL. DNM2 inhibitor MiTMAB inhibits cell proliferation and has synergistic effect with CK2 inhibitor CX4945 in leukemic cells. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
