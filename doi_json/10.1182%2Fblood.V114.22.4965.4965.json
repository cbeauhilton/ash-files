    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4965 Soluble interleukin-2-receptor (sIL2R) is a T-cell derived cytokine that induce proliferation of activated T-cells, modulates macrophage function and phenotype and participates in differentiation of B cells. sIL2R levels reflect immune-system activation. and is elevated in HIV-M and may be used to predict esponse to therapy with immunomodulation therapy with BPD.sIL2R has been reported in several malignant diseases with correlation to disease activity. Proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1b are positively correlated to sIL2R.Plasma cells may produce IL-6 by autocrine mechanism but a paracrine mechanism is involved in IL-6 production in bone marrow stromal cells. Growth of myeloma cells can be induced IL-6. We present a 43 YOF with HIV-M with elevated levels of sIL2R, C-reactive protein (CRP), IgG-kappa,lambda,IgM kappa level with serum free light chain kappa/lambda ratio. Treatment with biaxin,pentoxifylline, and low dose dexamethasone for 12-24 weeks resulted in normal levels of sIL2R, CRP, IgG,IgM and serum free light chain ratios. Conclusion Modulation of sIL2R with BPD in HIV-M patients with elevated proinflammatory cytokines may arrest the disease proliferation by controlling the growth potential IL-6 in both bone marrow plasm cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and correlates with the duration of survival.
