Describing treatment patterns and the laboratory and clinical outcomes associated with its use. Methods: A chart audit of patients treated with FLC removal by HCO-HD, using the Gambro HCO 1100 dialyser, was performed in 16 dialysis centers across 9 countries. Patient demographics, treatment patterns and dialysis side-effects were recorded. In addition, the following outcomes were measured: dialysis independence and reductions in serum FLCs concentrations at 12 and 21 days. Results: Data for 66 patients was entered. Patients had an average age of 65.1 (SD\u00d710.1); 42 of them (63.64%) were male and 24 (36.36%) were female. Sixteen (24%) presented with relapsing myeloma and 50 (76%) had de novo disease. On average, each patient received 13 HCO-HD sessions (SD\u00d78). Forty-one patients became dialysis independent (62.12%), after an average of 12 sessions. Dialysis related side-effects were reported in 6% of all patients. Forty patients (60.61%) were reported to have a sustained reduction in serum FLC concentrations by day 12. By day 21 this had increased to forty-one (62.12%). Among the patients who achieved a sustained reduction in serum FLC concentrations, 28 (70%) had a decline in FLC levels of more than 50% by day 12 and 34 (82.93%) by day 21. Among patients who achieved sustained reduction of more than 50% in serum FLC concentrations by day 12, 75% became dialysis independent. In comparison only 53% of those with a reduction of less than 50% became dialysis independent (p\u00d70.007). Furthermore, among patients who achieved sustained FLC reduction of greater than 75%, 81% became dialysis independent. The rate of dialysis independence was also significantly higher in patients with de novo disease compared with those with relapsing myeloma (64% versus 56%, p\u00d70.04). Conclusion: Free light chain removal by HCO-HD was well tolerated and associated with a very high rate of dialysis independence in patients with renal failure secondary to multiple myeloma. Rates of renal recovery were greater in patients with de novo myeloma and those who achieved an early reduction in serum FLC concentrations.
