    "abstract_text": "Introduction Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a high-risk malignancy with a poor prognosis. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be curative if it induces a potent graft versus leukemia (GvL) response. GvL responses and graft versus host disease (GvHD) are typically considered T cell mediated, because T cell depletion from hematopoietic stem cell grafts reduces the risk of GvHD at the cost of leukemia relapse. In addition, depletion of B-lymphocytes with rituximab has led to amelioration of GvHD in a number of studies suggesting that B cells are also important in the pathophysiology of GvHD and, in analogy, in GvL responses. However, the characteristics of the antibodies produced by these leukemic specific B cells have not yet been studied. Methods We selected three patients with high-risk myelomonocytic leukemia who remained disease free years after allogeneic HSCT, from whom we established clonal human B cell lines, using a unique and innovative technology that was developed in our laboratory (Kwakkenbos ea, Nat Med 2010). These B cell lines, that concomitantly express immunoglobulin on their membranes and secrete antibodies, were used to select antibodies specific for cell surface antigens on AML cell lines with similar morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics as the patients\u2019 leukemic blasts, using a FACS based assay. Results From each patient, several AML specific B cell clones were retrieved. Their antibodies recognized surface antigens on primary AML blasts derived from multiple patients and on AML cell lines, but not on healthy bone marrow, peripheral blood mononuclear cells or tissues such as liver, skin and colon. The majority of the antibodies were of the IgG3 isotype. Approximately 40% of the AML-specific antibodies induced direct death of cultured AML cell lines and of primary AML blasts. The cell death pathway induced by these cytotoxic antibodies was oncotic rather than apoptotic. Conclusion Our data demonstrate that high-risk AML patients with a potent GvL response mount robust antibody responses against surface antigens that are specifically expressed on tumor cells and binding of these antibodies induces direct cell death. The targets recognized by the recovered antibodies are also expressed on leukemic blast from other patients suggesting evidence for a common immune mechanism responsible for AML clearance. Our findings suggest that antibody responses are important in GvL and open up new ventures for specific antibody treatment of AML patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
