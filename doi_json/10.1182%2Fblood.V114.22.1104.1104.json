    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1104 Poster Board I-126 Relapse is the most common cause of treatment failure in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and is difficult to predict from information at diagnosis in the majority of cases. To explore the prognostic impact of recurrent copy number abnormalities on relapse in children diagnosed with precursor-B cell ALL, we performed genome-wide copy number profiling of 34 paired diagnosis-relapse samples. Lesions detected at diagnosis were often absent at relapse, including recurrent targets in precursor-B ALL like PAX5 (not preserved in 2 out of 7 cases with deletions at diagnosis), CDKN2A (not preserved in 1 out of 15 cases), and EBF (not preserved in 2 out of 5 cases), which illustrates that these lesions are often secondary events that are not present in the therapy-resistant progenitor that causes relapse. In contrast, deletions and nonsense mutations in IKZF1 , which encodes the lymphoid differentiation factor IKAROS, were highly frequent (38%) and always preserved at time of relapse. Locus-specific copy number screening of IKZF1 in an additional cohort of diagnosis samples from children enrolled in the Dutch treatment protocol DCOG-ALL9 with (n=40) or without (n=51) relapse revealed that IKZF1 deletions were significantly enriched in relapse-prone cases (22.5% vs 3.9%; P=0.007). An independent and unbiased validation cohort of 150 DCOG-ALL9 cases was used to confirm these findings, which established that 28.6% of the cases with IKZF1 deletion at diagnosis developed a relapse. Together, we conclude that deletions of IKZF1 in DCOG-ALL9 treated pediatric precursor-B ALL patients provide a strong prognostic marker for relapse.
