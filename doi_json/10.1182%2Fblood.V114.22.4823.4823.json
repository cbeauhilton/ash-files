    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4823 INTRODUCTION Protec\u0302\u00a2msome inhibitor bortezomib has used in treatment of hematology malignancies widely. We found it may reduce cell survival rate of HL60/ADR cell line and induce cell apoptosis in previous study. Now we are to investigate the effect of bortezomib alone or combined with arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 ) on reversing multidrug resistance of HL60/ADR cell line and the possible machines. METHODS HL60/ADR cells were incubated with bortezomib at different doses alone and in combination with As 2 O 3 . The proliferation ratio was observed by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was studied by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Intracellular concentration of daunorubicin (DNR) and multidrug resistance related protein-1 (MRP 1 ) was determined by flow cytometry. P65Ap-p65Abcl-2AbaxAcaspase-3Acaspase-9APARP proteins were determined by western blot. RESULTS In bortezomib-treated tumor cells, inhibition rate increased in time- and dose-dependently, as well as apoptotic cells. Compared to bortezomib alone, combination with As 2 O 3 inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of HL60/ADR cells more evident. Bortezomib can enhance the intraceflular accumulation of DNR and decrease MRP 1 in HL60/ADM cells. The dual combination of As 2 O 3 with bortezomib presents a superior anticancer and MRP 1 -decreased efficiency to either one of the drugs alone. Bortezomib can also elevate the expression of bax, caspase-3, caspase-9, PARP, and decelerate the expression of bcl-2, NF-\u03baB p65, p-p65. CONCLUSIONS Bortezomib can reverse multidrug resistance of HL60/ADR cells and decrease the expression of MRP 1 in cells. When combined with As 2 O 3, it appears to synergistic effects. Its mechanisms might be associated with the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation, also with inhibiting anti-apoptosis proteins, boosting pro-apoptosis proteins, with followed activating caspase pathway.
