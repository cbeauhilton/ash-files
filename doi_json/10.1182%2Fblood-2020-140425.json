    "abstract_text": "Background : CD3/CD19 cell depletion (Barfiled RC, et al, Cytotherapy, 2004), \u03b1\u03b2 T-cell/CD19 cell depletion (Locatelli F, et al, Blood, 2017), CD34+ positive selection (Aversa F, et al, NEJM , 1998) are designed to deplete T cells and reduce AGVHD following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT). These approaches achieved low rates of AGVHD, but the grafts had few T and B cells. To improve immune reconstitution we undertook an alternative approach to addback small numbers and percentages of immune cells in the final HSCT product. We previously reported a very low incidence of AGVHD in pediatric recipients receiving CD34 enriched HPC products with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) addback containing a fixed dose of 2 x 10 5 CD3/kg from MUD donors (Geyer/Cairo et al, BJH, 2012). Recently we demonstrated that despite a 5 log depletion of T cells, PBMNC addback (fixed at 2 x 10 5 CD3/kg) facilitated rapid hematopoietic engraftment, high levels of donor chimerism and immune reconstitution with a low probability of Grade II-IV AGVHD. Patients had a 1 yr OS of 90% following familial haploidentical (FHI) CD34 Enriched Stem Cell Transplantation in patients with SCD (Cairo, JAMA Pediatr, 2020). Objective : To determine the final immune cell concentration following CD34 enrichment and PBMNC (2 x 10 5 CD3/kg) addback and determine the effect on engraftment and T and NK cell immune reconstitution. Methods : Patients and/or their guardians signed written informed consents and/or assents (NCT NCT02675959). CD34 + enrichment was performed using a CD34+ reagent system (CliniMACS; Miltenyi Biotec). Mononuclear cells (2 \u00d7 10 5 CD3 cells/kg of recipient body weight) were removed from the leukapheresis collection prior to CD34 + enrichment and were cryopreserved as a source of MNC addback (T cells). The addback products were analyzed for CD3+CD56- T cells, CD3-CD56+ NK cells, CD3+CD56+ NKT cells, Lin-CD123+ HLA-DR+ DC cells and Lin-CD11c+ HLA-DR+ DC cells by multicolor flow cytometry analysis. Th1/Th2 cytokines were measured by multiplex assays. T cell activity was measured by viral T cells IFN-g and plasma cytokines. NK function was measured by NK receptor expression by flow cytometry analysis and in vitro cytotoxicity. Results: We identified in the PBMNC addback, mean+SEM white blood cell (WBC) percentage of: CD3+ CD56- T cells = 56.4\u00b15%; CD3- CD56+ NK cells = 4.6\u00b11%; CD3+ CD56+ NKT cells = 5.1\u00b10.6%; CD19+ B cells = 29.9\u00b13.5%. Lin- WBC consisted of: CD123+ HLA-DR+ DC cells = 18.4\u00b18.2%; CD11c+ HLA-DR+ DC cells = 6.0\u00b13.0%. There were 20.0+9.1e6 T cells, 1.1+0.3e6 NK cells, 1.6+0.7 e6 NKT cells, 8.6+2.5e6 B cells, 1.2+0.6e6 CD123+DC and 0.8+0.5e6 CD11c DC in the final infused products (Fig.1). We found that percentages of IFN-g+ in CD4 cells in response to CMV (pp65), ADV (hexon) and EBV (BZLF1), ranged from 0.2%+0.1% to 0.5%+0.1%, while percentages of IFN-g+ in CD8 cells in response to the antigens ranged from 0.7%+0.3% to 3.7%+1.8% when examined at days 180, 270 and 365. NK (CD3- CD56+) reconstitution was extremely rapid and occurred as early as day 30 (35.5\u00b18.6%, 2710+1624.4 cells/ul total cells; p<0.01 vs pre-t). There were no significant differences pre-HSCT vs day 365 in plasma cytokines (Th1 and Th2) and growth factors released including IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-18, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, G-CSF, MCP-1 and MIP1a. There was also robust expression of NK receptor expression including NK cytotoxicity receptors, NK KIR receptors, and C-type lectin-like receptors at day 30 as compared to pre-HSCT. NK cytotoxicity, as measured using PBMC cells from recipients at different time points against K562 (E:T=10:1), was also significantly increased at day 30 (26.2\u00b12.8%) and day 180 (28.3\u00b13%) vs pre-HSCT (16.1\u00b12.1%) (p<0.01). As a NK cell activation marker, CD107a expression and granzyme B levels in gated NK cells peaked at day 30. Conclusion: PBMNC addback to CD34 enriched HPC products, with a final dose of 2 \u00d7 10 5 CD3 cells/kg, led to stem cell products with a diverse mixture of T, NK, NKT, DC1, and DC2 cells. Immune reconstitution following PBMNC addback to CD34 enriched cells resulted in excellent CD4 and CD8 responses to CMV, ADV and EBV, and rapid functional NK cell reconstitution (Supported by FDA R01FD004090 (MSC)).
