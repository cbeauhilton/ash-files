    "abstract_text": "Gfi-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice generate abnormal immature myeloid cells exhibiting characteristics of both monocytes and granulocytes. One of Gfi-1\u2019s critical functions is to downregulate monocyte specific genes in order for granulocytes to develop properly. Since the transcription factors C/EBP alpha and C/EBP epsilon are needed for granulocyte development we hypothesized that these factors may regulate Gfi-1 expression. The Gfi-1 promoter contains several putative C/EBP binding sites and we show by electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation that C/EBP family members can bind to some of these sites. However we were unable to see activation of the Gfi-1 promoter by C/EBP proteins in transient transfection reporter assays. Other groups have shown that C/EBP proteins can synergize with the transcription factor c-myb. We observed that the Gfi-1 promoter contains sites for the hematopoietic transcription factor c-myb. Sevral of these c-myb binding sites are adjacent to C/EBP binding sites. In reporter assays in non-hematopoietic cells c-myb activated the Gfi-1 promoter by itself and this activity was enhanced when we included either C/EBP alpha or epsilon in the transfection. Our data suggests that C/EBP proteins and c-myb regulate the transcription of Gfi-1 in myeloid cells.",
