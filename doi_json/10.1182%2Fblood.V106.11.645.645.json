    "abstract_text": "Our understanding of the biology of MLL fusion gene leukemias is limited by the lack of knowledge of the effects of the different MLL fusion genes on expression of specific homoebox genes and the specific cell compartment(s) that are subsequently deregulated. In this study we investigated whether cellular deregulation was present in committed myeloid precursors and/or the multi-potent hematopoietic stem cells derived from Mll-AF9 knock-in mice. We used the murine knock-in model since it offers the advantage of a single copy of the Mll fusion gene under the control of the endogenous promoter that is present in every hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell. The Mll-AF9 knock-in mice display expansion of the myeloid compartment as early as 6 weeks of age (young adult) and develop myeloid leukemia at approximately 6 months. We purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) from wild type and Mll-AF9 young adult bone marrow. We depleted lineage positive cells using a magnetic separation system and purified the respective populations using fluorescence activated cell sorting with specific panels of antibodies (HSC=Li \u2212 /Thy1.1 lo /IL-7R \u2212 /C-kit + /Sca-1 + ; GMP=Lin \u2212 /IL-7R \u2212 /Sca-1 + /C-kit + /CD34 + /CD16/32 hi ). We cultured these cells in methylcellulose supplemented with GM-CSF, IL-3, SCF and IL-6, conditions that promote the growth of myeloid colonies. We assessed growth deregulation by increased colony numbers at the end of 7 days of culture and by the predominance of dense, compact colony morphology, the latter comprised of immature myeloid cells. Culture of HSCs from Mll-AF9 and wild type mice yielded an identical number of colonies (1102 and 1315 colonies per 10 4 cells respectively, average). In contrast, GMPs from Mll-AF9 mice yielded almost four times the number of colonies compared to wild type GMPs (3331 and 920 colonies per 10 4 cells respectively, average). Additionally, Mll-AF9 GMPs formed a higher number of dense, compact colonies compared to Mll-AF9 HSCs (1314 and 352 colonies per 10 4 cells respectively, average). Neither HSCs nor GMPs from wild type mice formed dense, compact colonies. These results indicate a greater deregulation of GMPs compared to HSCs in Mll-AF9 mice. MLL fusion gene leukemias are characterized by over-expression of specific homeobox genes, and we have previously shown that Mll-AF9 bone marrow cells display increased expression of 5\u2032 Hox-a genes and of the Hox co-factor Meis1 compared to wild type counterparts. We hypothesized that these genes are over-expressed in Mll-AF9 GMPs compared to wild type GMPs. Real time quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression levels of Hoxa7 , Hoxa9 and Meis1 were increased in Mll-AF9 GMPs compared to wild type (2.7 \u00b1 0.8, 11.7 \u00b1 7.8 and 19 \u00b1 11.3 fold respectively, mean \u00b1 SEM). Overall, these data support the hypothesis that the Mll-AF9 gene is \u201cinstructive\u201d at the molecular level at least in part via specific homeobox gene over-expression, resulting in deregulation and expansion of specific progenitor/stem cells such as the GMP population. This expanded GMP population then becomes a target for secondary mutations and later development of leukemia. Future studies focused on understanding the biology of this compartment in Mll-AF9 mice will help in our understanding of the pathogenesis of leukemia and aid in the development of newer, more effective therapies."
