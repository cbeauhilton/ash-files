    "abstract_text": "Background: SAR650984 (SAR) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds selectively to a unique epitope on the human CD38 receptor and may induce anti-tumor effects via antibody-dependent cellular-mediated cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, direct apoptosis induction without secondary crosslinking and/or allosteric inhibition on CD38 enzymatic activity. Preclinical and xenograft data supported the clinical use of SAR in combination with lenalidomide (LEN). Safety, response and progression free survival (PFS) data after a median follow-up of 6 months are reported (cutoff date: June 7, 2014). (NCT01749969) Methods: Patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma (RRMM) were treated with SAR at one of three dose levels (DL) 3, 5 and 10 mg/kg, every 2 weeks, in combination with LEN and dexamethasone (Dex). SAR was given IV on day 1 and 15 with dose escalation following the classic 3+3 design. Standard doses of LEN (25 mg days 1 \u2013 21 adjusted to 10 mg if baseline creatinine clearance \u2264 60mL/min) and Dex (40 mg days 1, 8, 15 and 22) were given in 28- day cycles. An expansion cohort of 18 patients was to be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest dose to be tested (10 mg/kg). Results: A total of 31 patients have been treated, including 24 patients (6 + 18) at the 10 mg/kg DL since the MTD was not reached. The median time from initial MM diagnosis to first dose of SAR was 4.5 years (1.1 \u2013 11.7) and the median number of prior treatment regimens was 6 (range 2 - 12). Over 95% of patients received prior IMiD \u00ae therapy (LEN=29, pomalidomide (POM) =9) and more than 85% of these patients (27/31) were relapsed or refractory to at least one prior IMiD \u00ae -based therapy. More than 90% of patients received bortezomib (BOR) and 48% received prior carfilzomib (CAR). No dose limiting toxicities were reported. The most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs- all grades) regardless of relationship included fatigue (41.9%), nausea (38.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (38.7%) and diarrhea (35.5%). Infusion associated reactions (IAR - all grades) occurred in 38.7% (n = 12) of patients, which predominantly occurred at cycle 1. Grade 3 IAR\u2019s occurred in 2 patients resulting in treatment discontinuation. No other TEAEs led to discontinuation and there were no related TEAE with a fatal outcome. The safety profile appears uniform across the DLs. The pharmacokinetic analysis did not reveal any drug-drug interaction between SAR and Len. With a median follow-up of 6 months, the ORR (all treated patients) was 64.5% (sCR = 2, VGPR = 8, PR = 10) and clinical benefit response (CBR) was 71%. Of note, among the 24 patients who were relapsed and refractory to their last regimen containing LEN, the ORR was 62.5 % and CBR was 70.8% (VGPR = 8, PR = 7, MR = 2). In addition, patients relapsed and refractory to both IMiD\u00ae and proteasome inhibitors (n = 21) had an ORR of 52.4 % and CBR of 61.9% (VGPR = 4, PR = 7, MR =2). The median time to first response among all treated patients was 4.2 weeks (4 \u2013 10.1) with median time to best response of 8.5 weeks (4 \u2013 32.6). Nine patients had improvement of response after a median of 16.1 weeks (8.1\u2013 32.6) of therapy: PR \u2192 sCR n = 1, VGPR \u2192 sCR n = 1, PR \u2192 VGPR n = 5, MR \u2192 PR n = 2. Median time on treatment was 26.4 weeks (2 - 61). 14 patients remained on treatment at the cutoff date. Median duration of response was 23.1 weeks (0.1 \u2013 54.7). Overall 15 (48.4%) patients had PFS events (deaths n =1 [unrelated] or progression n = 14) and median PFS was 6.2 months. For patients previously treated with LEN, BOR and at least one of the newer agents (CAR and/or POM and/or elotuzumab) (n=17), median PFS was 4.8 months. Conclusion: With a median follow-up of 6 months SAR/LEN/Dex administered to heavily pre-treated patients with RRMM appears effective with an ORR of 64.5%, CBR of 71% and PFS of 6.2 months. Responses were seen following the first cycle of therapy and deepen with continued treatment. The ORR was 62.5% in patients relapsed or refractory to their last regimen containing LEN. SAR in combination with LEN/Dex was well tolerated with impressive durable responses and warrants further evaluation. Disclosures Martin: Sanofi: Research Funding; Novartis: Speakers Bureau.
