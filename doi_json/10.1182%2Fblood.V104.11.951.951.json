    "abstract_text": "CD40 ligand is an accessory signal for T-cell activation and can overcome T-cell anergy. The OX40-OX40 ligand pathway is involved in the subsequent expansion of memory T cells. We expressed both human CD40L and OX40L on B-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL) cells, by exploiting the phenomenon of molecular transfer from fibroblasts engineered to over-express both of these TNF-receptor superfamily members. We analyzed the effects of the modified B-CLL cells on the number, phenotype and cytotoxic function of autologous T cells in seven B-CLL patients. Transfer of CD40L and OX40L to B-CLL cells was observed in all patients (mean value from 1% pre to 76% post for CD40L; from 0.7% pre to 88% post for OX40L). Subsequent up-regulation of the costimulatory molecules CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) was obtained after engagement of the endogenous CD40 receptor on B-CLL by the transferred CD40L molecules (mean value from 8% pre to 64% post for CD80; from 36% pre to 95% post for CD86). Co-culture of modified and unmodified B-CLL cells with autologous T cells revealed profound differences in the immune responses they induced. With unmodified B-CLL cells, or cells expressing either CD40L or OX40L individually, less than a 10-fold expansion of autologous T cells was observed, with a 40 fold expansion of autologous T cells - including both CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells with a Th1 pattern of cytokine release - and a >2500-fold increase in leukemia-reactive T cells. These expanded T cells were also directly cytotoxic to B-CLL targets, producing a mean 48% B-CLL killing at an E:T ratio of 10:1. A proportion of these tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells were specific for survivin, a B-CLL associated tumor antigen. Hence the combination of CD40L and OX40L expression by B-CLL cells allows generation of potent immune responses to B-CLL, which may be exploitable either by using active immunization with CD40L/OX40L-modified tumor cells or by adoptive immunotherapy with CD40L/OX40L generated tumor-reactive T cells."
