    "abstract_text": "A subset of acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cases harbor a t(10;11)(p13;q14) translocation resulting in the CALM-AF10 fusion gene. Standard chemotherapeutic strategies are not very effective in treating patients with CALM-AF10 fusions. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify molecular pathways dysregulated in CALM-AF10 positive leukemias which may lay the foundation for novel targeted therapies. The polycomb repressive complex 1 gene BMI1 is consistently overexpressed in CALM-AF10 leukemias. Previous studies have shown that CALM-AF10 leukemias express high levels of BMI1 , regardless of whether the leukemias are myeloid or lymphoid. Our analysis of TCGA acute myeloid leukemia (AML) data confirmed that AML cells with AF10-rearrangements displayed significantly higher expression of BMI1 transcripts compared to cells from non AF10-rearranged AML patients. These observations indicate that BMI1 may be directly activated by AF10-fusion oncogenes as suggested by our previous studies. We sought to investigate the role of BMI1 in CALM-AF10 mediated leukemogenesis using murine and human models of CALM-AF10-mediated AML. First, we tested whether BMI1 deficiency can affect CALM-AF10 mediated oncogenic transformation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Towards this end, we retrovirally transduced fetal liver cells from Bmi1 wild-type, heterozygous or homozygous null mice with the CALM-AF10 fusion oncogene. Upon plating these cells in colony forming unit (CFU) assays, we observed a significant decrease in the colony formation capacity of the CALM-AF10 fusion transduced cells on a Bmi1 deficient background. Next, we performed Cre-recombinase mediated excision of Bmi1 of already transformed CALM-AF10 myeloid leukemia cells ( Bmi1 floxed background). Bmi1 deletion led to a significant reduction in the number of total CFUs compared to Bmi1 wild-type cells, with a particularly striking reduction in the number of blast-like colonies. These experiments, using Bmi1 constitutive or conditional knockout-mice, revealed that CALM-AF10 transformed AML cells are dependent on Bmi1. Recently, selective pharmacological BMI1 inhibitors have been developed. We tested the impact of pharmacologic BMI1 inhibition on a panel of CALM-AF10-driven mouse leukemias with the small molecule inhibitor PTC-209. PTC-209 treatment increased gene expression of the known BMI1-repressed targets Cdkn2a ( p16 ) and Cdkn1a ( p21 ) and led to a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation. We also observed a marked increase in Annexin V+ cells upon PTC-209 treatment. In addition, cell-cycle analysis using BrdU incorporation assays revealed a significant decrease in cells in the S-phase, demonstrating that PTC-209 treatment leads to growth arrest and apoptosis in CALM-AF10 AML cells. In order to confirm these findings in human AML with CALM-AF10 rearrangements, we treated human CALM-AF10 positive AML cell lines P31, U937 and KPMOTS with PTC-209. Consistent with our results in the murine AML model, we observed a time and dose-dependent decrease in proliferation of these human cell lines upon PTC-209 treatment. Drug treated human cells also showed concomitant cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, coupled with an increase in expression of BMI1 repressed tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A and CDKN1A. In summary, our results demonstrate that BMI1 is a bonafide candidate for therapeutic targeting in AML with CALM-AF10 rearrangements and possibly other CALM-AF10 positive leukemias. We are now assessing clinical-grade BMI1 inhibitors for in vivo efficacy in mouse models of CALM-AF10-mediated AML.
