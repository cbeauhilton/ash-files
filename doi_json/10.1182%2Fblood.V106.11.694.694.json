    "abstract_text": "Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are caused by the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase oncogene. The Abl inhibitor imatinib is an effective, frontline therapy for early, chronic phase CML. However, accelerated or blast crisis phase CML and Ph+ ALL patients often relapse because of drug resistance that results from the emergence of imatinib-resistant point mutations within the Bcr-Abl kinase domain. The aminopyrimidine ATP-competitive inhibitor, AMN107, was designed to fit into the ATP-binding site of the Bcr-Abl protein in such a way as to exhibit higher efficacy against imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl point mutants. AMN107 is active against many imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants in vitro and in vivo , and is significantly more potent than imatinib against wild-type Bcr-Abl. AMN107 is currently showing promise in phase I/II clinical trials involving CML patients who are unresponsive to imatinib, and thus could potentially be used as a single agent in selected patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Alternatively, the use of more than one inhibitor of Abl should effectively lower the number of residual Bcr-Abl-expressing cells having the potential to undergo mutation, and therefore could potentially suppress the emergence of drug-resistant Bcr-Abl mutations. Thus, AMN107 and imatinib could be administered together to achieve higher responsiveness in CML patients. In the current study, we investigated the combination of imatinib and AMN107 in a panel of wild-type and imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl-expressing cell lines, including 32D.p210, K562, F486S-Ba/F3, F317L-Ba/F3, M351T-Ba/F3, and T315I-Ba/F3. We found evidence of additive to synergistic effects in several of the cell lines examined. In addition, the combination of AMN107 and imatinib was studied in vivo using a bioluminescent Bcr-Abl model of CML. Mice harboring murine 32D.p210 cells engineered to stably express firefly luciferase were treated with vehicle, AMN107 alone (15mg/kg), imatinib alone (75mg/kg), or both AMN107 and imatinib at their respective doses. Mice treated with both agents were observed to carry an overall lower tumor burden (as measured by levels of total body bioluminescence and percent spleen weights) than vehicle-treated mice and mice treated with each agent alone. These results suggest that the combination of imatinib and AMN107 may be a more effective treatment for CML than either agent alone."
