    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1248 Therapeutic approaches using multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are advancing in regenerative medicine, transplantation and autoimmune diseases. Until now the way of action for MSC-mediated immune suppression is still controversial and relies most probably on a multifactorial mechanism. MSCs have been demonstrated to produce the suppressive molecules hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), tumor growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Furthermore, it has been described that immunosuppression by MSCs is enhanced via stimulation with interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3). Recently, galectin-1, a \u03b2-galactoside binding lectin with immune modulatory properties, has been added to the group of immune modulatory molecules that are responsible for MSC-mediated immune suppression. Here, we identified galectin-9 (Gal-9) as a new molecule involved in MSC-mediated immune modulation. First, we isolated MSCs from bone marrow of randomly selected donors and performed several in vitro experiments regarding their immune modulatory potential (e.g proliferation and IgG production). Interestingly, Gal-9 was the only investigated protein, which was strongly upregulated in MSCs upon activation with IFN-\u03b3. We moreover demonstrate that Gal-9 is a major mediator of the anti-proliferative effect of MSCs on T-cells. Although a B-cell suppressive function of Gal-9 has previously not been reported, we were surprised to detect the same inhibitory effect on isolated B-cells. Proliferation of immune cells was triggered upon either stimulation with either PHA and LPS, or CD40L and PHA. Activation of MSCs with IFN-\u03b3 resulted in a major decrease of proliferation of both T-cells and B-cells. In addition, Gal-9 and activated MSCs contribute to the suppression of VZV triggered immunoglobulin release as well. Again activation of MSCs with IFN-\u03b3 decreased the IgG release, whereas blocking Gal-9 with lactose, a well characterized inhibitor of Gal-9 function, reversed the effect almost completely. Further, we determined that Gal-9 expression levels (mRNA and protein) distinguish between MSC cultures from different donors after activation. Among donors, we could differentiate between individuals with high Gal-9 levels and higher immune modulatory potential and such with low Gal-9 expression and lower immune modulatory potential. Compared to untreated MSCs we demonstrated a three- to fifty-fold rise in Gal-9 levels after prior activation with IFN-\u03b3. In addition, we demonstrated the upregulation of Gal-9 in MSCs by cell-cell contacts with either T-or B-cells. The upregulation was additionally at least two fold increased by previeously activating MSCs with IFN-\u03b3. Because our group is interested in the therapy of hemophilia A and because of the unxpected suppressive effect of Gal-9 on B-cells and B-cell function, we next tested the effect of MSCs and Gal-9 on the induction of inhibitory antibodies to coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). Mice were immunized with human coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in the presence or absence of either human MSCs, anti-murine Gal-9 or human Gal-9. As predicted, MSCs suppressed and anti-Gal-9 antibodies anhanced antibody formation. However in contrary to the expected, human Gal-9 co-treatment enhanced the anti-FVIII antibody response. A set of additional experiments revealed, that human Gal-9 suppresses murine regulatory T-cells in vivo . Further, in contrast to human immune cells, murine-derived T- and B-cells did not respond to human recombinant Gal-9 in vitro , but human IFN-\u03b3 activated MSCs were able to suppress proliferation of murine immune cells. Because of only 60% homology of murine and human Gal-9 we assume that the murine model cannot predict the function of human Gal-9 and that MSC-mediated immune modulatory functions are exerted via alternative pathways in this setting. Experiments with murine Gal-9 to demonstrate the in vivo function of Gal-9 are ongoing. In conclusion, Gal-9 is novel mediator of MSC immunomodulatory functions and affectsmultiple immune cell types including B-cells. Gal-9 is differentially expressed in MSCs from different donors and may therefore serve as a predictive indicator for clinical MSC functionality.
