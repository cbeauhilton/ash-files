    "abstract_text": "Congenital afibrinogenemia is very rare inherited bleeding disorder, caused by absence of fibrinogen in plasma. Serious spontaneous bleeding including intracranial haemorrhage may occur at any age. We present a case report of a boy with afibrinogenemia caused by novel mutation \u2013 homozygous deletion A\u03b1 6477A. Diagnosis was set after bleeding post cleft lip and palate plastic surgery. Spontaneous intracranial haematoma in occipital region occurred when the boy was 11 month old. Replacement therapy with plasma derived fibrinogen concentrate successfully covered neurosurgical evacuation of hematoma. The patient was then commenced on regular prophylaxis with fibrinogen concentrate two times a week. No further bleeding episodes occurred until present time. Spontaneous intracranial bleeding in patients with inherited bleeding disorders is often life threatening. Immediate replacement therapy is crucial, together with diagnostics and surgery, when necessary. Prophylactic substitution therapy after a severe bleeding episode is recommended.
