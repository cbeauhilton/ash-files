    "abstract_text": "Lymphocyte proliferation is a critical step in the immune response to antigen. Previously we demonstrated that \u03b2-catenin is constitutively expressed in hematologic malignancies and that \u03b2-catenin regulates leukemia cell proliferation. Here we report that \u03b2-catenin is highly regulated in peripheral blood lymphocytes via posttranslational mechanisms, and that \u03b2-catenin signaling promotes lymphocyte proliferation. \u03b2-catenin protein was undetectable by western blot in resting PBL and readily detectable within 30 min after activation by TCR ligation, mitogen or PMA/ionomycin. Proteasome inhibitor alone induced \u03b2-catenin accumulation in resting PBL. Transfection of \u03b2-TrCP1, an adaptor protein that recruits serine-phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin to the Skp1-Cullin-F box ubiquitin ligase complex down-regulated \u03b2-catenin in activated cells and conversely, dominant-negative \u03b2-TrCP1 upregulated \u03b2-catenin in resting cells. \u03b2-catenin was serine/threonine phosphorylated in resting PBL and rapidly dephosphorylated after activation, consistent with regulation by an activation-induced phosphatase. In resting PBL, elevation of intracellular Ca 2+ stabilized \u03b2-catenin protein. In activated PBL, \u03b2-catenin stabilization was inhibited either by blocking Ca 2+ flux with EGTA and BAPTA/AM, or by incubation with cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of the calcium-activated phosphatase calcineurin. In activated PBL inhibition of \u03b2-catenin nuclear signaling with dominant-negative \u03b2-catenin, dominant-negative TCF or \u03b2-catenin antisense inhibited IL-2 expression and proliferation. Conversely, wild-type \u03b2-catenin increased IL-2 expression and stimulated proliferation. We conclude that \u03b2-catenin protein is continuously synthesized and efficiently degraded in resting lymphocytes, \u03b2-catenin is rapidly stabilized in response to activation-induced Ca 2+ flux, \u03b2-catenin nuclear signaling plays a critical role in peripheral blood lymphocyte activation.",
