    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is an important curative strategy in adults with high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplasia (MDS). Disease relapse represents the major cause of treatment failure and whilst retrospective analyses have identified that pre-transplant measurable residual disease (MRD) is an important predictor of transplant outcome this has never been examined prospectively. The advent of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens has substantially increased the number of older adults eligible for allo-SCT but the optimal RIC regimen in high risk AML remains unknown. Registry data have demonstrated improved outcomes using a sequential transplant regimen utilizing cytosine arabinoside (araC)/amsacrine (AMSA) cytoreduction followed by a fludarabine (Flu)/busulfan (Bu) based RIC regimen (FLAMSA-Bu). However, although the FLAMSA-Bu regimen is now widely used in adults with high risk AML and MDS its benefit has not been evaluated in a randomized trial. We report the results of a randomized trial evaluating the FLAMSA-Bu regimen compared with standard RIC regimens which also represents the first prospective evaluation of the impact of pre-transplant MRD levels on transplant outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 244 patients (median age 59 yrs) with high risk AML (n=164) or high risk myelodysplasia (n=80) were randomized 1:1 to a control arm determined by investigator's choice of either Flu/B 2 /ATG (Flu, Bu 3.2 mg/kg x 2 days, ATG 2.5 mg/kg x 2 days); Flu/Mel/Alemtuzumab (A) (Flu, Mel 140 mg/m 2 , A 50 mg) or Flu/Bu 2 /A (Flu, Bu 3.2 mg/kg x 2 days, A 50 mg) versus an experimental arm of FLAMSA-Bu (Flu, araC 2g/m 2 x 4 days, AMSA 100mg/m 2 x 4 days, Bu -total dose 11.2 mg/kg). Patients over the age of 60 received an adjusted FLAMSA-Bu regimen utilising a reduced dose of araC (1mg/m 2 x 4 days) and a total Bu dose of 6.4 mg/kg. Patients were transplanted using either an HLA identical sibling (n=49) or matched (10/10 or 9/10) unrelated donor (n=195). All patients received cyclosporine GVHD prophylaxis. 155 patients with AML were in CR1 or CR2 at the time of transplant and 9 had primary refractory disease. MRD was monitored by flow cytometry (applying different-from-normal analysis when no diagnostic/relapse leukemic aberrant immunophenotype was available). Pre-transplant MRD levels were measured up to four weeks prior to transplantation in 201 patients (MRD positive = 80 (40%), MRD negative = 94 (47%), inadequate sample = 27 (13%)). MRD results were not reported to clinicians. The primary outcome was overall survival. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics including CR1/CR2 status, adverse cytogenetics and MRD levels were similar between regimens. Median follow up was 35 months. Transplant outcomes were comparable between patients allografted in the control and FLAMSA-Bu arms. 2 yr overall survival (OS) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) were 61% and 30% respectively in the control arm vs 62% and 26% for the FLAMSA-Bu arm. Transplant related mortality at 100 days was 3.0% in patients allografted using the control regimen vs 14% in patients allografted using the FLAMSA-Bu regimen and 17% vs 21% at 1 year. In the study cohort pre-transplant MRD positivity was associated with both an increased CIR compared to patients testing MRD negative (2 yr CIR 42% vs 19%, p=0.009) and decreased OS (2 yr OS 52% vs 71%, p=0.048). The FLAMSA-Bu regimen failed to improve OS or reduce CIR in either MRD positive or MRD negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: This trial, the largest randomized trial of RIC regimens in AML to date, did not detect any benefit of intensification of the conditioning regimen in adults with high risk AML or MDS. Specifically, the FLAMSA-Bu regimen was not associated with improved transplant outcome in patients who were MRD positive pre-transplant. These data include the first demonstration in a prospective analysis that the presence of pre-transplant MRD measured in real time is associated with reduced OS consequent upon an increased risk of disease relapse. Further randomized studies of novel conditioning regimens in adult AML, crucially with integrated MRD studies, are now required but these results support exploration of alternative strategies, such as pre or post-transplant pharmacological intervention, as the most promising strategy to reduce the risk of disease relapse post allograft.
