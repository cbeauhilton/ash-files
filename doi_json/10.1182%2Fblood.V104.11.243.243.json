    "abstract_text": "Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (MLBCL) is a clinically distinct entity that typically presents as localized, sclerotic disease in young, female patients. We previously characterized the transcriptional profiles of MLBCLs and identified important shared features with a clinically related disorder, classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) (Blood 102:3871, 2003). Given the documented role of the NFkB survival pathway in Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells, we previously assessed NFkB activation in MLBCL by determining the subcellular location of the c-REL subunit of the NFkB heterodimer with a 2-color immunofluoresence assay. In a small pilot MLBCL series, c-REL was localized to the nucleus in the majority of examined cases, consistent with NFkB activation. In the current study, we evaluated c-REL subcellular localization in an additional series of MLBCLs and DLBCLs using a broadly applicable immunoperoxidase method. 100% of MLBCLs exhibited nuclear c-REL staining whereas DLBCL c-REL subcellular localization was more variable. Thereafter, we analyzed the transcription profiles of the 34 MLBCLs and 176 DLBCLs for coordinate expression of NFkB target genes, using literature-curated NFkB target gene lists from three independent sources and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). MLBCL signatures exhibited significant enrichment of 2 of the 3 NFkB target gene sets. In addition, 32 NFkB target genes from the combined set were significantly more abundant in MLBCLs than DLBCLs (> 30% more abundant and > 99 th percentile in permutation analysis). Similar results were obtained in an independent series of MLBCLs and DLBCLs with available gene expression profiles (J. Exp. Med. 198:851, 2003). To assess the role of c-REL amplification in NFkB activation in our lymphoma series, we compared c-REL amplification, c-REL subcellular localization and coordinate expression of the identified NFkB target genes and classified the DLBCLs according to putative cell of origin. The majority of c-REL amplifications (67%) were found in DLBCLs of germinal center (GC) subtype, consistent with the observation that c-REL is part of the described GC signature. However, most (71%) of the examined GC DLBCLs had cytoplasmic c-REL expression and the GC DLBCLs did not have increased expression of NFkB target genes. Taken together with the MLBCL analyses, these studies indicate that: 1) NFkB is consistently activated in MLBCL; 2) c-REL amplification is not closely associated with NFkB activation in large cell lymphomas (LCLs); and 3) NFkB activation in LCL subtypes does not require amplification of the c-REL locus."
