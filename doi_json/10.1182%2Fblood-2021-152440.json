Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a rare benign disorder often presenting with tender cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, and malaise. While first described in Japan, its distribution is worldwide and predominantly seen in young adults. Diagnosis is based on characteristic histopathologic findings of patchy necrosis occupied by karyorrhectic debris and abundant histiocytes on node biopsy. The origin is unclear but associated with a preceding viral illness as well as cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Treatment is generally supportive and focused on managing tender lymph nodes. We present a case of a 28-year-old female presenting with a 2 month history of night sweats, fever, and weight loss in the setting of painful neck swelling. CT and PET/CT imaging demonstrated numerous hypermetabolic and enlarged nodes in the bilateral cervical and axillary regions. Lab studies were notable for leukopenia, anemia, and elevated inflammatory markers. A COVID-19 screening was negative. Excisional biopsy of a cervical node revealed extensive cortical necrosis and apoptotic debris with scattered histiocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in absence of neutrophils or a monoclonal B cell or T cell population. Treatment was initiated with NSAIDs and close monitoring. The patient exhibited a complete response after two months. Our case is an important reminder that lymphadenopathy, fever, and night sweats in a young adult are not pathognomonic for lymphoma. Nonetheless, a high suspicion for lymphoma should be maintained and followed with an expedited workup. Kikuchi-Fujimoto can certainly mimic Hodgkin lymphoma or other serious conditions like lupus erythematosus and tuberculosis. The diagnosis is largely one of exclusion following a careful examination of a lymph node histopathology and must be considered in young previously healthy adults to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary escalation of treatment.
