    "abstract_text": "We recently disclosed the discovery of ABT-737, a potent antagonist of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins that induced tumor regression in murine xenograft models. ABT-263 is a related, orally bioavailable Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor that is currently in clinical development. For both agents, multiple daily dosing from two to four weeks was well tolerated in all species evaluated. The primary preclinical toxicological finding in mouse, rat and dog was a unique thrombocytopenia characterized by a rapid clearance of circulating platelets. A series of in vivo studies that were performed to better characterize this phenomenon are described here. After a single intravenous or oral dose in dogs, circulating platelet counts decreased rapidly and concentration dependently with a nadir at approximately six hours post administration. Platelet counts returned to near normal levels within several days post dose, accompanied by an increase in both mean platelet volume and percent of reticulated platelets. Analysis of platelets by aggregometry during this rebound period indicated that returning platelets were fully functional. Following multiple doses, platelet counts also decreased rapidly after initial dosing, but exhibited evidence of rebound during the dosing period that appeared to be dose dependant. Evaluation of fibrinogen, d-dimer, antithrombin-III, PT and APTT did not support a mechanism involving consumptive coagulopathy. Whole body scintography utilizing [111] Indium labeled platelets in dogs indicated that platelet clearance after compound administration is primarily mediated by the liver. These data suggest that ABT-737 and ABT-263 preferentially affect circulating platelets rather than abrogating platelet production in the bone marrow. In fact, the observed rebound in platelet count in the face of continued dosing reflects the capacity for the animals to compensate for the effect. The enantiomer of ABT-737 (which has significantly lower activity against Bcl-2 family proteins) had no effect on circulating platelets in animals suggesting an underlying mechanism that is dependent on inhibition of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. The unusually rapid kinetics of platelet clearance and recovery suggests that the drug-induced thrombocytopenia elicited by these Bcl-2 family protein inhibitors is unique compared to that observed with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.",
