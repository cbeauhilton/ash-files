    "abstract_text": "Background: Advanced stage nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) in children and adolescents is a very rare entity and therefore few data about their treatment and outcome are available. Aim of the study: To describe the clinical characteristics and evolution of advanced stage NLPHL in children and adolescents Methods:A retrospective analysis of clinical data of patients treated in the SFCE and UK CCLG centers Patients and Results: 32 patients with NLPHL according to the REAL/WHO classification with disease stage \u2265 IIB were recorded between 1998 and 2013. Two patients had composite NLPHL and B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma at diagnosis. Median age was 12 years (range 4-17) and the majority were boys [n=28; 88%]. Stage distribution was: IIB =2 ( 6%), III =25 (71%) & stage IV =5 (15%). Twenty-seven patients had cervical node involvement while mediastinum involvement was seen in 11 (34% ) patients. B symptoms were seen in 2 and eight patients had ESR >30 mm. Sites of extra nodal localisation were bone, bone marrow, liver and lungs.Standard Hodgkin chemotherapy regimens (CT) were used in 26 patients (81%), combined with rituximab (R) in 5 children (3 to 6 doses) and along with 20Gy involved field radiotherapy in 6 children. NHL chemotherapy regimens were used in 5 patients; R-CHOP [n=3], LMB 01 regimen [n=1] and other regimen [n=1]. One patient received rituximab alone (4 doses) and 1 child had no treatment [watch and wait strategy]. Median follow up is 45 months (5 \u2013 162). Outcome: Overall survival is 96% and cumulative incidence of an event is 25%. Eight patients relapsed with a median delay of 15 months (5-73), and 3 had a second relapse 9,11 and 48 months respectively after first relapse. One patient treated with chemotherapy alone developed Ewing's sarcoma and died 2 years later. The only patient treated with rituximab alone relapsed at 22 months. Of note, no relapses were observed in patients who had chemotherapy and rituximab. Conclusion: Our report shows that while advanced stage NLPHL in children and adolescents is rare, their clinical outcome is very good. Additionally, this report may inform the basis of future treatment of advanced stage NLPHL in children and adolescents. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
