    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3498 Introduction: Oral mucositis is a complication of conditioning treatment that produces pain and morbidity in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients. The rationale of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a calcium phosphate mouth rinse (Caphosol) vs standard regimen in 40 adult patients undergoing allo-HSCT. Patients and Methods: 40 patients treated with allo-HSCT (31 from unrelated donors, 9 from siblings) performed in Hematology and BMT center in Katowice in 2009 were randomized and stratified by the conditioning regimen (busulfan-, treosulfan- or TBI- based), type of transplant (unrelated or related) and age into two equal groups. Treatment group received Caphosol washes 4 times daily from first day of conditioning until reaching ANC 0.2 G/l. Control group received standard topical mouth care with salvia, antibacterial and antifungal solutions. During the trial patients subjectively assessed level of pain in mouth and in pharynx using 0\u201310 scale and swallowing problems using 0\u20135 scale. Mucositis was judged by experienced physician. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: Average oral toxicity in WHO scale in Caphosol vs control group was 0.9 vs 1.8 (p=0.02), duration of mucositis was 3.2 vs 7.1 days (p=0.02). Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to mucosits was required in Caphosol vs control group in 0 vs 6 pts, average duration of TPN was 0 vs 1.9 days (p=0.009). Analgetics were required, respectively, in 3 vs 9 pts and analgesy lasted for 1.1 vs 3.4 days (p=0.047). Average subjective peak pain in mouth was 0.85 vs 1.75 (p=0.005) and in pharynx 1.95 vs 2.2 (NS) in Caphosol vs control group, average pain intensity was lower in Caphosol group throughout the whole period of mucositis. Intensity of swallowing problems tended to be lower in Caphosol group (NS). Acute GVHD was observed in 7 vs 9 pts in Caphosol vs control group and its average degree was 0.5 vs 0.9 (NS). Conclusions: Caphosol mouth rinse in the allo-HSCT recipients is associated with decrease of oral toxicity, lower peak pain due to mucositis and its shorter duration. In consequence, comfort of life is improved and the incidence of acute GVHD is reduced, as well as the requirement of TPN and analgetics.
