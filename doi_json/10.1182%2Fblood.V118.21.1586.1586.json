    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1586 Transformation growth factor (TGF-\u03b2) is a highly pleiotropic cytokine critical to a variety of cellular events such as cell differentiation and apoptosis. TGF-\u03b2 is synthesized as a prepro-TGF-\u03b2 precursor and secreted after being processed in Golgi apparatus as a latent form that non-covalently combines both TGF-\u03b2 and latency-associated protein (LAP). Our previous work in B-cell NHL has shown that the intratumoral T cell composition results in the establishment of a profoundly inhibitory tumor microenvironment. However, the underlying mechanism is only partially understood. In this study, using patient specimens and lymphoma cell lines, we evaluated the role of TGF-\u03b2 in the tumor microenvironment and determined the effect of TGF-\u03b2 on the generation of intratumoral T H 1, T H 17 and T reg cells in B-cell NHL. First, we determined expression of TGF-\u03b2 and found that a latent form of TGF-\u03b2 was specifically expressed on the surface of CD19 + B cells, but not on other types of cells from B-cell lymphoma biopsy specimens. By screening cell lines, we found that latent TGF-\u03b2 was also expressed on the surface of lymphoma cell lines, confirming the finding. Second, we tested whether surface expression by lymphoma cells led to the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 in culture medium. Using an ELISA assay, we detected variable levels of latent TGF-\u03b2 in the culture medium of primary malignant B cells (median 100 pg/ml per million cells, range: undetectable \u2212229 pg/ml, n=7). Similarly, lymphoma cell lines secreted variable amounts of TGF-\u03b2 from undetectable to 200 pg/ml per million cells. Next, we determined the effect of TGF-b on intratumoral T cell proliferation and differentiation. As expected, exogenous addition of TGF-\u03b2 inhibited the proliferation of T cells. Notably, the proliferation of intratumoral T cells was significantly reduced when co-cultured with lymphoma cells bearing an active form of TGF-\u03b2 compared to that with lymphoma cells without TGF-\u03b2. Using flow cytometry, we showed that the addition of exogenous TGF-\u03b2 enhanced Foxp3 expression in activated CD4 + , CD4 + CD45RA + or CD4 + CD45RO + intratumoral T cells, suggesting that TGF-\u03b2 promotes the generation of T reg cells in tumor microenvironment. In contrast, TGF-\u03b2 suppressed the expression of IFN-\u03b3 in activated CD4 + T cells and inhibited the up-regulation of IL-12 and IL-23-induced IFN-\u03b3 expression in CD4 + cells, indicating that TGF-\u03b2 suppresses the generation of T H 1 cells. TGF-\u03b2 alone slightly inhibited IL-17 expression in CD4 + T cells; however, TGF-\u03b2, in the presence of IL-6 and IL-23, up-regulated IL-17 expression in CD4 + T cells, suggesting proinflammatory cytokines are able to reverse the suppression induced by TGF-\u03b2. These results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 controls the generation of T H 1, T H 17 and T reg cells contributing to the imbalance of effector T H cells and inhibitory T reg cells in the tumor microenvironment of B-cell NHL. Since malignant B-cells produce TGF-\u03b2, these results further support the important role of malignant B cells in the regulation of intratumoral T cell differentiation and the host immune response.
