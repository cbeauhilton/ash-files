    "abstract_text": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have achieved unprecedented efficacy in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), however, imatinib resistance has emerged as a major problem in the clinic. Because the overexpression of BCR-ABL1 critically contributes to CML pathogenesis and drug resistance, targeting the regulation of BCR-ABL1 gene expression may be a novel therapeutic strategy. In this study, we found that the transcriptional repressor MXD1 showed low expression in CML patients and was negatively correlated with BCR-ABL1. Overexpression of MXD1 markedly inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells and sensitized the imatinib-resistant K562/G01 cell line to imatinib, with decreased BCR-ABL1 mRNA and protein. Further investigations using reporter gene analysis showed that MXD1 significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of the BCR-ABL1 gene promoter. Taken together, these data show that MXD1 functions as a negative regulator of BCR-ABL1 expression and subsequently inhibits proliferation and sensitizes CML cells to imatinib treatment.
