    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3229 Introduction: Several studies have reported that different components of fungi of the genera Aspergillus spp may induce protective T-cell responses in either mouse models of invasive aspergillosis (IA) or in human healthy subjects. We evaluated the occurrence of Aspergillus- specific T-cell responses to different Aspergillus recombinant antigens in patients with proven IA, during the course of the IA, to identify the antigens most frequently targeted by protective immune responses. We characterized phenotypically and functionally such specific T cells. Finally, from peripheral blood (PB) samples of the same IA proven patients, also collected during the active infection phase, we sought to expand such Aspergillus- specific T cells. Methods: 15 patients with proven IA, according to the EORTC/MSG criteria, have been enrolled into the study. Specific immune responses producing interleukin-10 (IL-10), interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), IL-4 and IL-17A were detected and characterized by enzyme linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay and cytokine secretion assay (CSA), in all the patients, during the entire course of the IA. The recombinant antigens used were GEL1p, CRF1p, PEP1p, SOD1p, \u03b11\u20133glucan, \u03b21\u20133glucan, and galactomannan (GM). Cytotoxicity has been investigated by means of the colorimetric assay with (2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxyanilide) sodium salt plus coenzyme Q0 (XTT assay). Aspergillus -specific T cells were obtained by culturing PB mononuclear cells with a mixture containing PEP1p, GEL1p, \u03b11\u20133 glucan and \u03b21\u20133 glucan. The infection course were divided into 4 phases, defined from t1 to t4, each of fifteen days interval, starting from the radiological diagnosis of IA. Results: Aspergillus -specific T cells producing either IL-10 or IFN-\u03b3 were detected to all the antigens, but GM. The number of antigens targeted by IFN-\u03b3 producing specific T cells progressively increased along the course of IA, being such protective responses to 3 out of 7 antigens at t1 and to 6 out of 7 antigens at t4. At t1, IFN-\u03b3 producing specific T cells were only detected to GEL1p, \u03b11\u20133 glucan and \u03b21\u20133 glucan. GEL1p and \u03b11\u20133 glucan resulted the antigens most constantly targeted by IFN-\u03b3 producing specific T cells, persisting the responses to these antigens in all the phases of IA. No Aspergillus -specific T cells producing IL-4 to any antigens were detected by the ELISpot assay. Aspergillus -specific T cells producing IL-17A were detected in only one out of 15 patients, and targeted CRF1p. Specific T cells to GM and specific T cells producing IL-4 to all the antigens could be shown only by CSA, suggesting that they are present only at very low frequencies during the infection. After 13-day cultures, Aspergillus- specific T cells were expanded from five out of five patients. The specific T cells tested for lytic activity included a median of 95.8% CD3+ cells, either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, and showed a median lytic activity of 9.45% either at 3/1 or at 5/1 effector/target cells ratios. Conclusions: In patients with IA, protective immune responses may be detected since the onset and increase during the infection. At the onset of IA, specific T cells producing IFN-\u03b3 target antigens involved in the cell wall biosynthesis of Aspergillus . On the other hand, at the same phase, specific protective immune responses to CRF1p, PEP1p, and SOD1p, which are all putative virulence factors for Aspergillus, are absent. Aspergillus -specific T cells may be expanded by a mixture of antigens, even in the course of IA and are able to directly kill fungal hyphae. The above mentioned antigens and the corresponding protective T cells may be exploited for therapeutic strategies of either vaccine or autologous cytotoxic cell infusions in patients at high risk for IA.
