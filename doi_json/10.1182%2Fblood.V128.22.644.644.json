    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Systemic amyloidoses are a group of rare disorders characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in tissue, resulting in the dysfunction of vital organs (eg, heart and kidneys). In amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis, the most common form of systemic amyloidosis, the amyloidogenic protein is a misfolded light chain (LC) or a fragment of an LC produced by clonal plasma cells. Current therapies used to treat AL amyloidosis limit LC production but do not directly target deposits underlying multiorgan failure. NEOD001, a monoclonal antibody, targets misfolded LC and is thought to neutralize circulating LC aggregates and to clear insoluble deposits. In an interim analysis of a phase 1/2 dose-escalation study in 27 patients with AL amyloidosis and persistent organ dysfunction (NCT01707264; EudraCT2012-002683-27), monthly infusions of NEOD001 were safe, well tolerated, and associated with renal and cardiac responses. 1 Here we report updated results from the escalation phase and new results from the expansion phase of this study. Patients and Methods: Inclusion criteria for this trial were that patients complete \u22651 PCD treatment before enrollment, attain partial hematologic response (HR) or better to any previous therapy, and have persistent organ dysfunction. NEOD001 was administered intravenously every 28 days. During the dose-escalation phase, 27 patients received NEOD001 at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 24 mg/kg in a 3+3 study design. An additional 42 patients with renal, cardiac, or peripheral nerve involvement were enrolled and treated (24 mg/kg) in the expansion phase. We assessed safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, cardiac and renal responses based on consensus criteria, and neuropathy responses using the Neuropathy Impairment Score-Lower Limb (NIS-LL). Results: The 42 additional patients enrolled in the expansion study included cohorts with renal (16 patients), cardiac (15 patients), and peripheral nerve (11 patients) involvement. In the overall population (n = 69), the median age was 60 years, and 61% of patients were men. Median (range) time since diagnosis was 2.8 (0.4-12.8) years, and 45% of patients underwent \u22653 previous plasma cell-directed regimens. The total number of infusions administered was 913 over a mean of 13.2 (range, 3-35) months. NEOD001 treatment was not associated with dose-limiting toxicities or discontinuations; patients did not develop antidrug antibodies or treatment-related serious adverse events. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug, were fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, and diarrhea. In a best response analysis, 53% of cardiac-evaluable patients (N = 36) and 63% of renal-evaluable patients (N = 35) met respective criteria for organ response; no patients experienced disease progression. The median time to initial response was 2 months (cardiac) and 4 months (renal). After 9 months of treatment, 82% of patients with measurable peripheral neuropathy at baseline (N = 11) achieved a peripheral neuropathy response based on the NIS-LL score. Conclusions: Our interim results demonstrated that monthly NEOD001 infusions were safe and well tolerated and that organ response rates compared favorably with traditional chemotherapy. These updated results from the escalation phase and these new results from the expansion phase, including results from patients with peripheral nerve involvement, support the design of ongoing late-stage clinical studies. Antibody therapy may allow for effective treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis. Reference: 1. Gertz MA, Landau H, Comenzo RL, et al.
