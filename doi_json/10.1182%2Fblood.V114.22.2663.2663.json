    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2663 Poster Board II-639 Natural killer (NK) cells are an important component of the innate immune surveillance of tumor cells. Defective NK cell function has been correlated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is well established that NK cell-mediated cytolytic activity is significantly diminished in AML patients; the mechanisms of this hypo-function are not well understood. Identifying mechanisms of tumor-induced immune suppression of lymphocytes function will aid the development of effective immunotherapeutic strategies. In the present study we examined the molecular basis for impaired NK cell responses in AML and demonstrate impaired NK cell immunological synapse formation. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize F-actin polymerization at the immune synapse between CD56+ CD3- NK cells and autologous AML blasts. We identified a significant reduction in formation of the NK cell immune synapse (NKIS) (p 70% reduction). This defect was induced by direct tumor contact since NK cell defects were induced in healthy NK cells when they were co-cultured (in direct contact) for 48 hr with allogeneic AML blasts, but not with healthy allogeneic monocytes (P < 0.01). In control transwell co-culture experiments, where the NK cells and AML blast were not in direct contact, we did not observe the induced defect. We examined the molecular nature of the AML blast induced defect by quantifying recruitment of a number of these NK cell adhesion and cytoskeletal signaling proteins to the immune synapse. Following primary co-culture with AML blasts, healthy NK cells showed significantly reduced recruitment of integrin LFA-1, CD2, Lck, WASP, and tyrosine-phosphorylated protein to the NK-AML target interactions synapse (P < 0.001). These studies demonstrate a role for the tumor induced immune suppression of NK cells and will aid in the development of immunotherapeutic approaches targeting AML.
