    "abstract_text": "Btz (VELCADE \u00ae ) is approved for patients (pts) with relapsed MM. This study characterized PK/PD of btz at 2 doses (1.0, 1.3mg/m 2 ) after single- and multiple-dose administration, and evaluated their relationship. 24 pts with relapsed MM and creatinine clearance \u226550mL/min were randomized to btz 1.0 (n=12) or 1.3mg/m 2 (n=12) on D 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21-D cycle (C). Pts could continue therapy for \u22658 Cs if beneficial. PK/PD samples were drawn at multiple time points on D1 and D11 of C1 and C3 over 48h. Plasma concentrations of btz were similar following administration of 1.0 and 1.3mg/m 2 ; differences in mean plasma C max and AUC values were within the degree of intersubject variability (Table). There was a decrease in clearance and an increase in terminal half-life of btz on D11 vs D1 of C1.The volume of distribution of btz suggests extensive peripheral tissue distribution. After single or repeat administration, mean maximum percent inhibition of 20S proteasome activity (vs baseline) in whole blood was 70\u201384% and 73\u201383% for the 1.0 and 1.3mg/m 2 doses, respectively. The percentage of pts who had >90% inhibition was greater in subsequent doses vs first dose. Reversibility of 20S proteasome inhibition in whole blood was demonstrated. PK/PD modeling revealed an exposure-response relationship, with E max and EC50 values consistent across study days. These results confirm btz is a potent inhibitor of the 20S proteasome. The efficacy of single-agent btz has been explored and validated in the pivotal phase 2 SUMMIT and phase 3 APEX trials at 1.3mg/m 2 , and explored in the phase 2 CREST trial at 1.0mg/m 2 . Complete safety and efficacy data by dose will be presented. Mean\u00b1SD PK parameters of btz in plasma  . 1.0mg/m 2 . 1.3mg/m 2 . 1.0mg/m 2 . 1.3mg/m 2 . . D1/C1 (n=11) .
