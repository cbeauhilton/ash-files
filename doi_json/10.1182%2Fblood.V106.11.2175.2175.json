    "abstract_text": "Thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ) is a short-lived metabolite of the fatty acid arachidonate that is formed upon platelet activation; it stimulates platelet responses including shape change, aggregation and secretion of granule contents. The TXA 2 pathway of platelet activation is important clinically as demonstrated by the beneficial effect of aspirin, that inhibits TXA 2 formation, in preventing arterial thrombotic events. TXA 2 elicits its stimulatory responses on platelets by binding to the G protein-coupled thromboxane prostanoid (TP) receptor (approximately 55 kD). Of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms of the TP receptor that have been identified, TP\u03b1 appears to be the predominant form expressed in platelets, utilizing G q and G 12 in signaling. There have been reports of inherited platelet function disorders involving the TXA 2 pathway of platelet activation, and the best characterized is a single amino acid substitution (Arg 60 \u2192 Leu) in the first cytoplasmic loop of the TP\u03b1 receptor in a dominantly-inherited bleeding disorder characterized by a defective platelet response to TXA 2 . Here, we describe a pediatric patient with an inherited platelet defect in the TXA 2 pathway that does not appear to involve a mutation in the TP\u03b1 receptor. The 10 year-old patient and his mother (but not his father) have significant bleeding histories involving recurrent epistaxis (patient) and severe menorrhagia with chronic iron deficiency (mother). Platelet counts of both son and mother are in the normal range. Consistent findings with platelet aggregation testing were prolonged lag phases with collagen, decreased (mother) to minimal (patient) responses with arachidonate and shape change only with the stable TXA 2 mimetic U46619. PFA-100 closure times were prolonged with the aspirin-sensitive collagen/epinephrine cartridge: >271 sec (patient), 222 sec (mother) (upper limit of normal: 163 sec for children, 142 sec for adults), but normal with the collagen/ADP cartridge: 97 sec (patient), 85 sec (mother) (upper limit of normal: 111 sec for children and adults). Dense granule counts, determined by whole mount electron microscopy, were slightly lower than normal for both the patient (2.3/platelet) and his mother (2.8/platelet) (normal range: 3\u20137/platelet). Western blotting utilizing the polyclonal P 2 rabbit anti-human TP receptor antibody showed the presence of an approximately 55 kD band in both subjects. Fresh platelets from the patient\u2019s mother were available for flow cytometric analysis with the P 2 antibody; mean fluorescence intensity of P 2 binding for the patient\u2019s mother\u2019s platelets was 67.6 compared with 60.4 for platelets from a healthy control. Analysis of the TP\u03b1 receptor gene of the patient indicated a heterozygous synonomous substitution C795T in Ile 265 of the sixth transmembrane domain; this substitution was not present in the mother. Taken together, these results suggest a dominantly-inherited platelet function disorder involving the TXA 2 pathway of platelet activation. The presence of a normal TP\u03b1 receptor gene and normal levels of the TP\u03b1 protein indicate the likelihood of a downstream TXA 2 -signaling defect.",
