    "abstract_text": "Induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF: \u03b12\u01b42) is a recognized mode of action of hydroxyurea, the sickle cell disease (SCD) standard of care in SCD, and has been shown to prevent red blood cell (RBC) sickling. Discovery of novel HbF inducers is underway and several therapeutics with the potential to increase HbF expression are currently at different stages of preclinical and clinical development. Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is a heterodimeric heme-containing enzyme whose catalytic activity is regulated by nitric oxide (NO). Binding of NO to heme activates the catalytic domain of sGC, enabling synthesis of the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate. sGC stimulators are small molecules that synergize with NO to boost signaling via the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway. This signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of many physiologic processes including inflammation, fibrosis, and blood flow. Perhaps less well-known, cGMP-mediated signaling has also been implicated in the regulation of the gene encoding the \u01b4-globin subunit of fetal hemoglobin (Modulation of NO signaling by sGC stimulation, therefore, has the therapeutic potential to target the complex pathology of SCD at multiple levels. In this study, we focused on one potential mode of action of sGC stimulation-increasing HbF expression. We characterized the effects of the sGC stimulator olinciguat on \u01b4-globin gene expression. Olinciguat is currently being investigated for the treatment of patients with SCD in a Phase II STRONG-SCD study (NCT03285178). The effect of olinciguat treatment on \u01b4-globin mRNA levels was studied in the K562 erythroleukemic cell line. For short-term (8 hours) treatment with olinciguat, K562 cells were maintained in a serum-free media. For long-term (4 and 7 days) treatment, cell culture media contained 1% fetal bovine serum. Hydroxyurea was used as a positive control. Levels of \u01b4-globin mRNA were expressed relative to mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. K562 cells were treated for 8 hours with increasing concentrations of olinciguat (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 \u00b5M). Treatment of K562 cells with 0.1, 1, and 10 \u00b5M of olinciguat increased \u01b4-globin mRNA levels by 1.43\u00b10.08-, 1.37\u00b10.06-, and 1.47\u00b10.06-fold (mean\u00b1SEM), respectively. For comparison, 8 hours of treatment with hydroxyurea (800 \u00b5M) increased \u01b4-globin mRNA levels by 1.25\u00b10.03-fold. When K562 cells were cultured in the presence of olinciguat for 4 days, significant ( P <0.05) induction of \u01b4-globin mRNA levels was observed at 1 and 10 \u00b5M (1.13\u00b10.03- and 1.55\u00b10.09-fold, respectively). Induction of \u01b4-globin mRNA following 4 days of incubation with hydroxyurea (800 \u00b5M) was 2.38\u00b10.2-fold. The effects of hydroxyurea and olinciguat on \u01b4-globin mRNA levels were compared following 7 days of incubation with the compounds. After 7 days of treatment of K562 cells with 0.1, 1, 3, and 10 \u00b5M of olinciguat, \u01b4-globin mRNA levels were increased by 1.83\u00b10.19-, 1.66\u00b10.09-, 2.4\u00b10.06-, and 2.9\u00b10.33-fold, respectively. Treatment with 50- and 800-\u00b5M hydroxyurea increased levels of \u01b4-globin mRNA by 2.33\u00b10.15- and 3.8\u00b10.56-fold, respectively. In conclusion, the sGC stimulator olinciguat increased the expression of mRNA for the \u01b4-globin subunit of fetal hemoglobin in the erythroleukemic K562 cell line. This finding indicates that amplifying NO signaling by stimulating sGC may increase HbF expression, thereby preventing pathologic RBC sickling; this extends the potential therapeutic utility of olinciguat in SCD. Finally, the ability of olinciguat to induce HbF in SCD patients will be assessed in the ongoing Phase II STRONG-SCD study (NCT03285178). Disclosures Miyashiro: Ironwood Pharmaceuticals: Employment.
