    "abstract_text": "Objective To compare the effiency and safety of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation versus chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first remission Methods Clinical data of 225 patients who were diagnosed AML between Jan 1st 2006 to Dec 31 2011,getting CR1 after chemotherapy,of which 77 patients received allogeneic stem cell transplantation after CR1(SCT group) and 148 patients still received chemotherapy(CTx group).Follow up to Dec 31 2012,we evaluate the RFS and OS between SCT and CTx group Results Median follow up time\u0081FSCT 34.00 months\u0081GCTx 25.50 months.The median CR period(months): SCT 33.00 vs CTx 22.50(p<0.01)\u0081G 3y OS: SCT 75.8% vs CTx 55.8%(p<0.001),both in intermediate and unfavourable karyotype group, SCT is better than CTx with statistical significance. 3y RFS: SCT 72.7% vs CTx 44.8%(p<0.001),both in intermediate and unfavourable karyotype group, SCT is better than CTx with statistical significance. Among the 148 patients in CTx group,79 died by the end of the follow up time,of which 31 died of TRM.In the SCT group, the TRM rate was 11/18,the TRM rate has no statistical significance between the two groups. Conclusions Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is safe and effective for AML-CR1 patients who are categorized into the intermediate or unfavourable group according to the SWOG criteria.
