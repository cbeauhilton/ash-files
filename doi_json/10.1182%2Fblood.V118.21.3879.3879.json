    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3879 GM-CSF stimulates proliferation of granulocytes, macrophages, and hematopoietic progenitors. Upon binding to its cellular receptor (R), GM-CSF induces dimerization of the GM-CSFR \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits, phosphorylation of Janus kinase (JAK)-2, and activation of downstream signaling pathways. Because GM-CSF improved the response to Rituximab monotherapy in patients with CLL (Ferrajoli A. Leuk Lymphoma 50:514, 2009) and was found to upregulate CD20 cell surface antigen expression (Vanugopal P. et al. Leuk Res 24:411, 2000), we investigated the effect of GM-CSF on CLL cells. Incubation of peripheral blood (PB) CLL cells with increasing concentrations of GM-CSF (0.05 to 1.0 \u03bcM) did not induce the phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT5, AKT, or ERK as assessed by western immunoblot, or phosphorylation of JAK2 as assessed by immunoprecipitation. Therefore, we investigated whether CLL cells express GM-CSFR. Western immunoblot studies revealed that, like normal B lymphocytes, CLL cells do not express GM-CSFR\u03b2 but, unlike normal B cells, CLL cells express high levels of GM-CSFR\u03b1. Flow cytometry analysis of PB cells from 8 patients with CLL showed that 13 to 59% of CLL cells (CD19+/CD5+) co-expressed CD116 (GM-CSFR\u03b1) but not CD131 (GM-CSFR\u03b2). Thus, we wondered what induces GM-CSFR\u03b1 expression in CLL cells. Because STAT3 is constitutively activated in CLL and sequence analysis revealed that the GM-CSFR\u03b1 promoter harbors \u03b3-interferon activation sequence (GAS)-like elements typically activated by STAT3, we sought to determine whether STAT3 activates GM-CSFR\u03b1. In MM1 cells, interleukin (IL)-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation and up-regulated GM-CSFR\u03b1 whereas STAT3-siRNA down-regulated both STAT3 and GM-CSFR\u03b1 protein levels, suggesting that STAT3 activates transcription of GM-CSFR\u03b1. To clarify these findings, we cloned the human GM-CSFR\u03b1 promoter, generated a series of truncated promoter constructs and assessed their activity using a luciferase assay. We found that IL-6 augmented luciferase activity of GM-CSFR\u03b1 promoter \u22124012 \u2013 +23, \u22123018 \u2013 +23, \u22122517 \u2013 +23, and \u2212496 \u2013 +23, suggesting that IL-6 enhanced GM-CSFR\u03b1 expression by activating STAT3. Furthermore, we established that regions, located between bp \u22123581 TTGTTGAAAA \u22123572, \u22122984 TTTTCTTAA \u22122976 and \u221277 TTTCCCAA \u221270, harbor GAS-like elements that activated the GM-CSFR\u03b1 promoter upon exposure to IL-6. Binding of STAT3 to those regions in IL-6-stimulated MM1 cells was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). To test whether STAT3 induced transcription of GM-CSFR\u03b1 in CLL, we obtained fresh PB CLL cells and, by using the same GAS-like element-containing probes, performed EMSA. CLL cell nuclear protein bound these probes and anti-STAT3 and -phosphoserine STAT3 antibodies attenuated the binding. CLL cell ChIP confirmed that STAT3 binds to the promoter of GM-CSFR\u03b1 as well as the promoters of the STAT3-regulated genes STAT3, c-Myc and P21, but not to that of the control gene RPL30. Finally, using qRT-PCR and western blot analysis we determined that STAT3-shRNA down-regulated GM-CSFR\u03b1, STAT3 and STAT3-regulated gene mRNAs, and STAT3 and GM-CSFR\u03b1 protein levels. Taken together, these data suggest that constitutively activated STAT3 binds to the GM-CSFR\u03b1 promoter, activates its transcription, and induces production of GM-CSFR\u03b1 protein in CLL cells.
