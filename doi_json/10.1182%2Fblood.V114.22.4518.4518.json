Methods We present the clinical and laboratory features, diagnosis and treatment of a patient with human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Case presentation The patient with human granulocytic anaplasmosis presented with fever,cough?Adiarrhea?Amyalgia?Afacies typhosa?Arelative infrequent pulse and swelling of lymph nodes. Laboratory examination showed the patient had leukopenia?Athrombocytopenia?Aproteinuria?Aliver injury?Ablood clotting abnormal?AEBV-DNA positive. We also found the patient's ferritin?Acreatase?Aamylase and lipase increased. In the patient's bone marrow, plasma cells were increased, hemophagocyte and intragranulocytic inclusions were found. The patient did not respond to the treatment of imipenem, cefepime hydrochloride and teicoplanin. But he was treated successfully with moxifloxacin. Conclusion Patient with human granulocytic anaplasmosis can present leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, blood clotting abnormal and plasma cells increased in bone marrow. It's quite necessary to make differential diagnosis with some blood diseases. The patient can be accompanied with EBV infection and hemophagocytic syndrome. The patient can be cured by antibiotics-quinolones. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
