    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4613 Circadian rhythms regulate various functions of human body and disruption of circadian rhythm has been associated with cancer development and tumor progression. Circadian clock genes use transcriptional-translational feedback loops to control circadian rhythms. Many transcriptional regulators are histone acetyltransferases (HAT) or histone deacetylases (HDAC). As clock function and integration of inputs rely on transcriptional regulation, it is possible that chromatin is remodeled during circadian cycles and in response to signals that regulate the clock. SIRT1 (sirtuin 1) is a HDAC that has recently been identified as a crucial modulator of the circadian clock machinery. To date, at least 7 SIRT genes ( SIRT1\u20137 ) have been identified. In our previous report we have demonstrated the daily expression patterns of PER1 , PER2 , PER3 , CRY1 , CRY2 , and CKIe in peripheral blood (PB) of healthy individuals were abolished in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients and partial recoveries of daily patterns were observed in CML patients with complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) post-imatinib treatment [ J Biol Rhythms 2011]. In this study we further investigated the expression profiles of the 7 SIRT genes ( SIRT1\u20137 ) in PB total leukocytes from 49 CML and 22 healthy volunteers. Collection of PB was carried out at four time points: 2000 h, 0200 h, 0800 h, and 1400 h, respectively. In PB total leukocytes of healthy individuals, the daily pattern of SIRT1 ( p < 0.01) and SIRT5 ( p < 0.05) expression level peaked at 0200 h, and SIRT2 ( p < 0.01) peaked at 0800 h. Daily pattern expression of these 3 genes was abolished in newly diagnosed pre-imatinib mesylate treated and blast crisis-phase CML patients. Partial daily patterns of gene expression recoveries were observed in CML patients with CCyR and MMR. In some serial monitored individual patients, the recoveries of oscillations of SIRT1 , 2 , and 5 genes expression accompanied with the disappearance of BCR-ABL transcripts were also noted. The expression of SIRT3 , 6, and 7 did not show a time-dependent variation among the healthy and CML patients. SIRT4 expression was undetectable both in the healthy and CML patients. Updated in vitro study results of the regulation of SIRT1 , 2 , and 5 genes on circadian clock genes expression will be presented at the meeting.
