    "abstract_text": "Genetic and functional studies have demonstrated that FL cells retain the major features of normal germinal center (GC)-derived B cells, in particular the dependency on an active crosstalk with their specialized microenvironment. In agreement, microarray analyses have recently revealed that FL patient outcome is primarily predicted by molecular characteristics of tumor-infiltrating immune cells instead of tumor cells. However, our knowledge of the crucial interactions between malignant and non-malignant cells in FL remains limited by the use of whole biopsy specimen to perform gene expression profiling (GEP). We thus conducted GEP on both CD19 pos B cells and CD19 neg CD22 neg non-B cells purified from lymph nodes of 17 patients with de novo FL & 4 normal donors (CD20 pos >94.5%, median=98.2%) and 9 de novo FL patients & 5 normal donors (CD20 pos 80, 10870 probesets were selected for further analyses. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Eisen\u2019s software) allowed the correct classification of the 35 samples into the 4 groups: FL B-cell, Normal B-cells, FL non-B cells, and Normal non-B cells. Supervised analyzes were done using asymptotic non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test (fold change \u22652, P<0.01) and confirmed by permutation analysis (500 permutations, false discovery rate <5%) using SAM software. We first established the list of the 841 probesets that were differentially expressed between FL and normal B-cells containing, 355 probesets overexpressed in malignant B cells including genes involved in GC B-cell biology ( BCL6, MTA3, ID2, CD80, SDC4 ) and oncogenes as well ( BCL2, AURK2 ) and conversely, 486 probesets downregulated in malignant B cells involving several interferon-stimulated genes for example. We then looked for the FL-specific microenvironment signature and pointed out the 1206 probesets that were differentially expressed between FL and normal non-B cells. Interestingly, all these genes were upregulated in the lymphoma context. Among them, we identified a striking follicular helper T-cell (T FH ) signature ( CXCR5, ICOS, CXCL13, CD200, PDCD1, SH2D1A ) and an activated T-cell signature ( IFNG, FASLG, GZMA, ZAP70, CD247 ). Notably, the T FH and activated T-cell signatures were not merely a surrogate for the number of T cells since many standard T-cell genes ( i.e. CD2, CD4, CD7, LEF1, CD8A ) were not induced in the FL microenvironment. Finally, in order to draw an overview of the FL-specific synapse between B and non-B cell compartments, we isolated a group of 2323 probesets that were differentially expressed between both compartments in FL and not in normal context. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software we then identified among them FL-specific functional networks, including an IL-4- & an IL-15-centered pathway. Altogether, these data shed new light on our understanding of FL biology and could be a source of new therapeutics targeting the interplay between B cells and their microenvironment.",
