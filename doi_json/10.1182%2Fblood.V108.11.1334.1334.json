    "abstract_text": "MicroRNAs (miRs) are a recently realized class of epigenetic elements which block translation of mRNA to protein. MicroRNAs have been shown to control cellular metabolism, apoptosis, differentiation and development in numerous organisms including drosophila, rat, mouse, and humans. Recently, miRs have been implicated in the control of hematopoiesis. Importantly, both aberrant expression and deletion of miRs are have been associated with the development of various cancers. In a previous study, we determined the gene expression profiles of HSC-enriched, HPC-enriched, and total CD34+ cells from human PBSC, BM, and CB. One rather surprising finding from this study was that virtually all of \u201chematopoietic important\u201d genes were expressed at virtually identical levels within all populations examined. One of our hypotheses to explain this phenomena was that miRs may control differentiation by controlling protein expression from these \u201chematopoietic\u201d RNAs. To examine the possible role of miRs in normal hematopoiesis and their relation to the HSPC transcriptome, we used mir-miroarrays to determine the miR expression profile of primary normal human mobilized blood and bone marrow CD34+ hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs). We have combined this miR data with (1) our extensive mRNA expression data obtained previously for CD34+ HSPCs, CD34+/CD38\u2212/Lin- stem cell-enriched, CD34+/CD38+/Lin+ progenitor-enriched populations, and total CD34+ HSPC (Georgantas, Cancer Research 64:4434) and (2) miR target predictions from various published algorithms. Combining these datasets into one integrated database allowed us to bioinformaticly examine the global interaction of HSPC mRNAs and miRs during hematopoiesis. The 3\u2032UTR sequences from many of these \u201chematopoietic\u201d mRNA were cloned behind a luciferase reporter. K562 cells were transfected with these luc-3\u2032UTR constructs, confirmating that expression of many important hematopoietic proteins are controlled by miRs. Based on our bioinformatic and protein expression studies, we present a global in silico model by which microRNAs control and direct hematopoietic differentiation. Actual in vitro and in vivo studies addressing the action of specific miRs in hematopoietic differentiation are presented in separate abstracts.",
