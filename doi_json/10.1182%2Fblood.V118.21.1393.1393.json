    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1393 The oncoprotein E2A-PBX1 is produced by t(1;19)(q23;p13) in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Perplexingly, in vitro and in vivo models of E2A-PBX1 leukemogenesis to date generate either myeloid or T-lymphoblasts, neither of which are representative of the human disease. Furthermore, we have observed recently that lineage-depleted (lin-) murine bone marrow cells infected with an E2A-PBX1 retrovirus selectively fail to repopulate the B-lymphoid compartment on transplantation into irradiated recipients. Therefore, we have now begun to investigate the mechanism by which enforced expression of E2A-PBX1 antagonizes B-lymphopoiesis. We show that E2A-PBX1-transduced lin- fetal liver progenitor cells (FLPs) fail to differentiate to committed CD45R+ pro-B-cells when cultured with IL-7 in the presence of OP9 stromal cells. Instead these cells manifest a relatively immature immunophenotype (CD45R-, CD11b-, CD117+), are murine stem cell factor (SCF) dependent, and undergo myeloid differentiation upon stimulation with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or transplantation into irradiated mice. Amino acid substitutions in E2A-PBX1 that impair co-activator recruitment or DNA binding completely rescue the differentiation block, implying a critical role for target-gene regulation by E2A-PBX1. E2A-PBX1-transduced cells fail to induce the B-lymphoid commitment genes Ebf1 and Pax5 , and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis shows aberrant persistence of the Polycomb silencing mark H3K27me3 at these promoters. Previous studies have identified the Polycomb gene Bmi1 as a candidate E2A-PBX1 target gene. However, enforced expression of Bmi1 neither blocked induction of Ebf1 or Pax5 nor impaired B-lymphopoiesis, indicating that Bmi1 is not sufficient to mediate blocked differentiation by E2A-PBX1. Gene expression microarray analysis identified cytokines (ex., Csf2 , IL1a , Il6 ) and transcription factors ( HoxA9, Tal1 ) up-regulated in E2A-PBX1-transduced FLPs that are known to antagonize B-lymphoid development. In summary, our results support the notion that enforced expression of E2A-PBX1 in early hematopoietic progenitors blocks B-lymphopoiesis, to an important degree, by inducing the transcription of genes whose products antagonize early steps of B-lymphoid commitment, including induction of Ebf1 and Pax5. HoxA9 is particularly interesting as a mediator of E2A-PBX1 effects in view of its extreme induction ratio in our system (at least 1000-fold relative to controls), its propensity to promote myeloid over lymphoid differentiation, and its well-established role in leukemogenesis. Studies to investigate a potential requirement for HoxA9 and other candidates in mediating the E2A-PBX1-driven B-lymphoid differentiation block are ongoing.
