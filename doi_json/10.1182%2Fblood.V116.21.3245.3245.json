    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3245 Whilst modern treatment approaches cure a high number of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), little progress has been made in the treatment of refractory and relapsed ALL and new treatment approaches are needed. We recently demonstrated that anti-HLA-DR class II monoclonal antibody (mAb) L243 induces a novel non-apoptotic mode of cell death in B-cell lymphoma lines, defined by homotypic adhesion (HA), actin reorganisation and lysosomal activity (Ivanov et al. J Clin Invest, 2009). Here, we extend these important observations and examine whether this novel form of mAb induced cell death occurs in pre-B ALL cell lines. Expression of HLA-DR was determined using flow cytometry in a panel of ALL cell lines (REH, SupB15 and SD1). HLA-DR was expressed at high levels on each of the cell lines. The ability of L243 to induce HA and cell death (Annexin V/PI positivity) was assessed using microscopy and flow cytometry respectively. L243 was able to evoke both strong HA and cell death in all of the ALL cell lines (e.g. in SupB15 cells 46\u00b11.7% death versus 7\u00b10.5% in controls, p<0.001 by Student's t-test). Inhibitors of actin polymerization (cytochalasin D, latrunculin B) were used to assess the role of actin in cell death and HA induced by L243. These inhibitors of actin polymerization inhibited both HA and cell death elicited by L243 (e.g. in SupB15 cells 24\u00b10.5% death versus 10.3\u00b10.8% with Latrunculin B, p<0.001), demonstrating the dependence of HA and cell death on actin reorganisation. The importance of cell to cell contact in this form of antibody induced cell death was confirmed by the addition of low-melting point agarose which physically blocked cell to cell contact and markedly attenuated cell death induced by L243. In contrast using the pan-caspase inhibitor QVD OPH had no effect on cell death induced by L243, indicating that this mode of death is non-apoptotic. These findings demonstrate that anti-HLA DR mAb L243 induces a novel model of cell death in ALL cell lines that is independent of caspase activation and dependent on actin reorganization. This data suggests that this novel mAb induced death pathway is independent of apoptosis and potentially exploitable in the clinic in leukemias resistant to chemotherapy apoptosis induction.
