    "abstract_text": "Within the bone marrow environment, adhesive interactions between stromal cells and extracellular matrix molecules are required for stem and progenitor cell survival, proliferation and differentiation as well as their transmigration between bone marrow (BM) and the circulation. This regulation is mediated by cell surface adhesion receptors. In experimental mouse stem cell transplantation models, several classes of cell adhesion receptors have been shown to be involved in the homing and engraftment of stem and progenitor cells in BM. We have previously found that integrin a6 mediates human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell adhesion to and migration on its specific ligands, laminin-8 and laminin-10/11 in vitro ( Gu et al, Blood , 2003 ; 101 : 877 ). Using FACS analysis, the integrin a6 chain was now found to be ubiquitously (>95%) expressed in mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (lin \u2212 Sca-1 + c-Kit + , lin \u2212 Sca-1 + c-Kit + CD34 + ) both in adult bone marrow and in fetal liver. In vitro, about 70% of mouse BM lin \u2212 Sca-1 + c-Kit + cells adhered to laminin-10/11 and 40% adhered to laminin-8. This adhesion was mediated by integrin a6b1 receptor, as shown by functional blocking monoclonal antibodies. We also used a functional blocking monoclonal antibody (GoH3) against integrin a6 to analyse the role of the integrin a6 receptor for the in vivo homing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We found that the integrin a6 antibody inhibited the homing of bone marrow progenitors (CFU-C) into BM of lethally irradiated recipients. The number of homed CFU-C was reduced by about 40% as compared to cells incubated with an isotype matched control antibody. To study homing of long-term repopulating stem cells (LTR), antibody treated bone marrow cells were first injected intravenously into lethally irradiated primary recipients. After three hours, bone marrow cells of the primary recipients were analysed by competitive repopulation assay in secondary recipients. Blood analysis 16 weeks after transplantation revealed an 80% reduction of stem cell activity of integrin a6 antibody treated cells as compared to cells treated with control antibody. These results suggest that integrin a6 plays an important role for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell homing in vivo.",
