    "abstract_text": "Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and von Willebrand factor (VWF) both play a centrol role in hemostasis, illustrated by the severe bleeding disorders associated with their functional absence. Despite their different functionalities in hemostasis and being products from two different genes, both proteins circulate in a tight, non-covalently linked complex. The physiological concequences of complex formation are many, including stabilization of FVIII heterodimeric structure, protection of FVIII from protelytic degradation, and modulation of FVIII immunogenicity. Another relevant issue relates to the chaperone function of VWF, allowing FVIII to survive in the circulation. FVIII levels are markedly reduced in patients with no detectable VWF protein or with a defect in VWF-FVIII complex formation, indicating that VWF prevents FVIII from premature clearance. Moreover, evidence points to FVIII actually being predominantly cleared as part of the VWF-FVIII complex rather than as a separate protein. First, it is possible to predict FVIII half-life fairly accurately by knowing antigen levels of VWF and its propeptide in combination with blood group. Second, when FVIII and VWF are co-injected in Vwf -deficient mice, FVIII is targeted to the same macrophages as is VWF. Since the end of the 1990s, our knowledge on the clearance mechanism of FVIII and VWF has started to emerge, and multiple clearance receptors for both proteins have now been identified. Interestingly, there exists a large overlap in receptor-repertoire between FVIII and VWF. These findings have taught us that it will be difficult to design single-mutant FVIII or VWF variants that have prolonged half-lives. How then to prolong the half-life of FVIII to improve treatment of hemophilia A? Several novel bioengineered FVIII variants have been developed, including PEGylation, Fc fusion and single-chain design, aiming to increase FVIII half-life. These approaches have so far achieved only moderate increases in half-life (1.5- to 2-fold compared to marketed FVIII products), significantly less than when similar modifications are being applied to factor IX. Indeed, it seems as if in designing these FVIII variants, the role of the significant other in the complex has been overlooked, since FVIII clearance is principally determined by VWF. Could we instead use VWF as a tool to prolong half-life of FVIII? This option is actually limited by the nature of the interaction between VWF and FVIII. Although of high affinity, the interaction is characterized by high association- and dissociation-rates. Infusing FVIII in combination with long-acting VWF variants will therefore result in a rapid redistribution of FVIII to endogenous VWF, as has elegantly been shown by the group of Ginsburg. To overcome this limitation, we have designed a FVIII variant (FVIII-KB013bv) in which we have replaced the B-domain by a single-domain, llama-derived antibody fragment (nanobody) that recognizes the D'D3-region of VWF. Consequently, the dissociation-rate of the VWF/FVIII complex is reduced 100-fold. Preliminary studies revealed that FVIII-KB013bv has a two-fold prolonged half-life compared to FVIII, likely due to improved VWF binding properties. Combination of the FVIII-nanobody fusion protein with long-acting VWF variants is anticipated to prolong its half-life well beyond the limit of the current long-acting FVIII variants.
