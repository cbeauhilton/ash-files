    "abstract_text": "Natural killer(NK) cells are innate effector cells of the immune system, believed to limit viremia and tumor burden before the onset of adaptive T and B cell immunity. NK cells are potent effector cells in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. NK cell activity is partially controlled through interactions between killer Ig-like receptors on NK cells and their respective HLA class I ligands. Immunosuppressive agents including cyclosporin, FK506 and Rapamune are utilized in clinical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Little is known about the effects of immunosuppressive agents on NK cells post bone marrow transplantation. The in vivo effects of Rapamune on NK cells were determined in an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation model. Splenic NK cell levels in recipients treated with Rapamune decrease markedly. NK cell proliferation and function are significantly decreased in the presence of Rapamune. Studying the differential effects of immunosuppressive drugs on NK cell function is critical in clinical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."
