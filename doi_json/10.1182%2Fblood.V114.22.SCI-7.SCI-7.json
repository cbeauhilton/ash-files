    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-7 Efforts to define the mechanisms of globin gene expression and transcriptional control of erythrocyte formation have provided key insights into our understanding of developmental hematopoiesis. Our group has focused on GATA-1, a zinc finger protein that was initially identified through its ability to bind a conserved cis element that regulates globin gene expression. GATA-1 is essential for erythroid development and mutations in the GATA1 gene are associated with human cytopenias and leukemia. Several general principles have emerged through studies to define the mechanisms of GATA-1 action. First, GATA-1 activates not only globin genes, but also virtually every gene that defines the erythroid phenotype. This observation sparked successful gene discovery efforts to identify new components of erythroid development and physiology. Second, GATA-1 also represses transcription through multiple mechanisms. This property may help to explain how GATA-1 regulates hematopoietic lineage commitment and also how GATA1 mutations contribute to cancer, since several directly repressed targets are proto-oncogenes. Third, GATA-1 regulates not only protein coding genes, but also microRNAs, which in turn, modulate erythropoiesis through post-transcriptional mechanisms. Fourth, GATA-1 interacts with other essential erythroid-specific and ubiquitous transcription factors. These protein interactions regulate gene expression by influencing chromatin modifications and controlling three-dimensional proximity between widely spaced DNA elements. Recently, we have combined transcriptome analysis with ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq studies to correlate in vivo occupancy of DNA by GATA-1 and other transcription factors with mRNA expression genome-wide in erythroid cells. These studies better elucidate how GATA-1 recognizes DNA, discriminates between transcriptional activation versus repression and interacts functionally with other nuclear proteins. I will review published and new aspects of our work in these areas. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
