    "abstract_text": "Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), also known as heat shock protein 32 (Hsp32), has recently been identified as a stress-related survival molecule that acts anti-apoptotic and cytoprotective in inflammatory reactions. Recent data suggest that HO-1/Hsp32 is also expressed in neoplastic cells in various malignancies. In the present study, we provide evidence that HO-1 is constitutively expressed in primary leukemic cells in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n=17) and in various AML cell lines such as HL60, KG1, KG1a, and U937. Expression of HO-1 mRNA was demonstrable by RT-PCR, and the HO-1 protein by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. In addition, we were able to demonstrate expression of HO-1 mRNA and of HO-1 protein in the CD34+/CD38\u2212 progenitor/stem cell fraction in the leukemic clone in patients with AML. The HO-1 inductor hemin (10 \u03bcM) was found to promote expression of HO-1 in AML cells. Incubation with the HO-1-targeting drugs pegylated zink protoporphyrin (PEG-ZnPP) or styrene maleic acid-conjugated ZnPP (SMA-ZnPP), resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of growth of leukemic cells at pharmacologic concentrations (IC 50 : 5\u201320 \u03bcM for cell lines and primary AML cells). The SMA-ZnPP-induced growth-inhibition of AML cells were found to be associated with induction of apoptosis as evidenced by light microscopy, electron microscopy, and by a Tunel assay. In consecutive experiments, combination experiments were performed using SMA-ZnPP and AML cell lines. In these experiments, SMA-ZnPP was found to synergize with cytarabine in producing growth inhibition in all AML cell lines tested. In summary, these data show that HO-1/Hsp32 is a novel survival factor and interesting target in AML. The clinical significance of this observation remains to be determined in forthcoming trials."
