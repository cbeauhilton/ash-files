    "abstract_text": "While proteasome inhibitors are effective therapy for multiple myeloma (MM), their efficacy could be improved by synergistic targeting of apoptosis. The intracellular serine/threonine kinase Akt has been demonstrated to have a central role in MM cell growth, survival, and drug resistance. Akt is activated by extracellular cytokines such as IGF-1 and IL-6, and contributes to MM resistance by ameliorating the apoptotic effects of proteasome inhibition. Akt requires chaperone proteins for proper stability and function, including the 90 kD molecule Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP-90). HSP-90 function is abrogated by geldanamycin and its derivative, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). In the U266 MM cell line, the IC50 of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and 17-AAG was 100 nM and 800 nM, respectively. Following exposure of U266 MM cells to either drug alone, or the combination at a fixed-ratio of their IC50s (1:8), apoptosis was determined by Annexin V staining and FACScan analysis. Synergy analysis was performed using Calcusyn (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). We found that the combination index (CI) was synergistic (CI<1) throughout the dose range, with a CI = 0.449 \u00b1 0.298 at the combination IC50 (highly significant). For example, the apoptotic effect of 50 nM MG-132 and 400 nM 17-AAG was 6 \u00b12 % and 23 \u00b13 %, respectively, whereas the 50:400 nM combination produced apoptosis in 68 \u00b1 2 % of the cells. To analyze effects on Akt and its substrates, we incubated U266 MM cells with MG-132 (50 nM), 17-AAG (400 nM), or the combination. We harvested lysates after zero, two, six, and 24 hours incubation, and Western blot analysis was performed. Co-incubation with MG-132 and 17-AAG, but not either alone , depleted Akt by 24 hours post-therapy. Co-treatment also produced significantly greater upregulation of HSP-90 and HSP-70 than 17-AAG alone, thus demonstrating greater functional inhibition of Akt. The combination also demonstrated the greatest abrogation of Akt-mediated effects on mitochondrial apoptosis: Co-treatment produced the greatest expression of BAD, decreased BCL-XL expression, reduced phosphorylation of GSK-3, and produced the greatest activation of caspase 3. Monotherapy with 17-AAG upregulated HSP-90 and HSP-70, reduced BCL-XL expression, and activated caspase 9. MG-132 monotherapy produced none of these effects. These findings demonstrate that synergy between proteasome inhibitors and 17-AAG is mediated by Akt depletion and abrogation of Akt signaling, predominantly by MG-132 augmentation of 17-AAG - mediated decay of Akt. Down-regulation of Akt-mediated resistance allows dual-apoptotic signaling and synergistic effect of combination therapy. These findings demonstrate a mechanistic rationale for utilizing heat shock protein inhibitors in combination with proteasome inhibitors as therapy for MM."
