    "abstract_text": "Despite the high prevalence of PHTN in adults with SCD, the prevalence in the pediatric population with SCD is not known. We hypothesized that elevated pulmonary artery pressures may be found in SCD adolescents with history of pulmonary complications, such as acute chest syndrome (ACS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), asthma, and reactive airway disease. Thirty such sickle cell disease adolescents were screened at Howard University or University of Michigan for PHTN with Doppler echocardiography. We defined PHTN as a tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) of at least 2.5 m/sec (corresponding to a pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 35 mm Hg). PHTN was found in 16 SCD patients (53.3%) and 5 (16.7%) had TRV > 3.0 m/sec. Clinical findings according to the presences or absence of PHTN are shown in the table. Potential factors contributing to PHTN in patients with SCD include chronic hemolysis and chronic hypoxia. Our results suggest that PHTN is common among SCD adolescents with a history of pulmonary complications. Consideration should be given to screening such patients for PHTN and exploring treatment options. Further studies are urgently needed to clarify the prevalence and mechanisms of PHTN in adolescents with SCD.
