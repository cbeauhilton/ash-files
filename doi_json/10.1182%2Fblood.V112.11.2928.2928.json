    "abstract_text": "VSLI is a nanoparticle formulation of vincristine sulfate (VCR) encapsulated in sphingomyelin/cholesterol (SM/Chol) liposomes called Optisomes \u2122 . In preclinical studies, VSLI has provided targeted, increased, and sustained delivery of VCR to tumor cells compared to administration of conventional or non-SM/Chol liposome-encapsulated VCR. VSLI is being developed to improve patient outcomes without increased VCR-related peripheral neuropathy (PN). We report an integrated analysis of the PN profile of VSLI from two distinct multi-center clinical studies: A Phase 1 dose-escalation study in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory ALL of weekly VSLI plus pulse dexamethasone at doses ranging from 1.8 to 2.4 mg/m 2 without dose capping A Phase 2 study in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory NHL of biweekly VSLI at a dose of 2.0 mg/m 2 without dose capping Subjects with prior history of Grade 3 or 4 PN related to chemotherapeutic agents were not eligible for either study. Subject characteristics, VSLI dosing details, and relevant clinical outcomes are provided in the Table. Results are presented as median (range) unless otherwise stated.  . ALL (N=36, 12F/24M) .

Six of the 22 ALL subjects (27%) who experienced PN achieved CR, compared to 1 of 14 (7%) subjects without PN (p>0.05). Nineteen of the 50 NHL subjects (38%) who experienced PN responded to VSLI, compared to 11 of 69 (16%) subjects without PN (p=0.01). In general, the PN observed in these lymphoid malignancy populations, with near universal prior VCR exposure, was primarily mild and moderate in grade and rarely required VSLI discontinuation. Despite prior VCR exposure, and residual PN in some, the amount of VCR delivered as VSLI in both ALL and NHL subjects prior to PN onset was greater than the PN trigger cumulative doses reported for conventional VCR (5 mg for PN; 15 mg for severe PN). In both studies, subjects who experienced PN received higher cumulative doses of VSLI and achieved more responses compared to subjects who had not experienced PN. The pharmacokinetic profile, targeted delivery, and VCR dose-intensification facilitated by VSLI have the potential to produce meaningful response rates without therapy-limiting PN."
