    "abstract_text": "Analysis of diversity and clonality is an important tool in monitoring reconstitution of the immune system and identificating specific immune reaction clones involved in hematological malignancy individuals who accepted hematological stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We have previously reported the evolution of malignant and reactive \u03b3\u03b4+ T cell clones in a case with relapse T-ALL before and after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) (from 4 weeks to 108 weeks), relapse was discovered with the same TCR V\u03b45+ T cell clone at 100 weeks after transplantation, and the patient underwent chemotherapy over the next two months and achieved again remission with minimal residual disease (MRD). We sequentially monitored the clinical and laboratorial features of this T-ALL case. The patient was received three times donor lymphocytes infusion (DLI) at 117, 120 and 124 weeks after HSCT. In 178 weeks after transplantation, the patient underwent relapse again, however, in this time the patient underwent III grade chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD). We continued to analyze the samples at different time points after HSCT and DLI, the leukemic V\u03b45+ T cell clone was detected in most samples, while this clone could not be detected in donor sample ( Figure 1 ). Moreover, we found that a monoclonally expanded TCR V\u03b44 which we reported before and it remained detectable in all samples post transplantation, interesting same monoclonal V\u03b44 clone was identified in sample from donor which was collected at time for DLI. The sequence of V\u03b44 was confirmed as same TCR rearrangement: V\u03b44D\u03b43J\u03b41, and the expression level of V\u03b44 was significantly increased at the time of disease relapse, the V\u03b44 expression level in samples from PBMC and bone marrow at different time point was showed in figure 2 . The monoclone V\u03b44 from donor was thought as specifically expanded for unknown antigen (maybe for virus or leukemia) and may possess cytotoxicity in donor, however, the persistent expansion of V\u03b44 in receptor was thought that might be responsible for leukemic cells, virus infection or cGvHD, it remains an opne question. Because patient underwent III grade cGvHD, and whether this V\u03b44+ T cell clone was mainly associated with cGvHD, it is needed further investigation. In addition, the clonally expanded V\u03b43 with same size was also detected at time before HSCT, and most time points after HSCT, while it could not be identified in donor sample ( Figure 3 ). Obviously, this expanded V\u03b43+ T cell clone originated from patient, and it is possible that this T cell clone possesssed a specific anti-leukemia function, because it appeared at the time with minimal residual disease, however, the function of clonally expanded V\u03b43 is needed further confirmation. And it is needed also to analyze the clonality of TCR V\u03b1 and V\u03b2 subfamilies. In conclusion, dynamically monitoring TCR repertoire and combining the characteristic of clinical status might benefit for characterizing the malignant clonal evolution, monitoring the specific T cell clone for graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) or GvHD effect and designing specific therapeutic strategies in T-ALL.
