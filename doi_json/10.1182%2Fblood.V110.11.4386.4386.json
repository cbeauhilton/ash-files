    "abstract_text": "The differentiation of leukemic cells into mature cells is a major strategy for treatment of leukemia. Many trials for more efficient differentiation of leukemic cells have been performed using single uses of differentiation inducers including interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1), interleukin-4 (IL-4), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or their combinations. Here we show that combination of TNF-\u03b1 with DMSO enhances HL-60 cell differentiation. TNF-\u03b1 enhanced DMSO-induced expression of CD11b and increase of G 1 phase in the cell cycle, which are hallmarks for HL60 cell differentiation. Inhibition of ERK pathway, but not NF-\u03baB pathway, abolished the enhancement of DMSO-induced HL-60 differentiation by TNF-\u03b1. These results suggest that TNF-\u03b1 enhances HL-60 cells towards induction of differentiation by DMSO through activation of ERK/MAPK signaling pathway."
