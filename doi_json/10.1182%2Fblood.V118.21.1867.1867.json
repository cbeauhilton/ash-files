    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1867 Background: In recent years, there have been major advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) as patients now have treatment options that greatly improve clinical outcomes. Many publications have described the safety of anti-myeloma drugs in the clinical trial setting. However, very few have addressed the issue of tolerability of these agents in a real-world clinical setting. Lenalidomide is an effective treatment option for MM and is currently approved by the EMA and US FDA for the treatment of MM patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy. Here we analyze the tolerability of 3 common novel agent-based anti-myeloma therapies in daily clinical practice. Methods: This observational post-authorization safety study was designed to characterize the safety profile of lenalidomide and to compare the incidence of adverse events (AE) with those occurring in patients receiving other anti-myeloma treatments. Patients entering the study had previously received at least 1 prior therapy and were commencing a new treatment for their relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM). Patients were enrolled into the Lenalidomide Cohort (lenalidomide plus dexamethasone) or the Background Cohort (all other treatments) based on investigator's discretion. Thromboprophylaxis was allowed, but not required. Results: As of July 2011, 2201 RRMM patients in 265 institutions in 17 European countries were enrolled. 1500 received lenalidomide, 538 bortezomib, 90 thalidomide, and 73 received other therapies or had missing data. 75 patients from the Background Cohort crossed over to receive lenalidomide. Median follow-up was 20.7 weeks (range, 0.1\u2013125.7 weeks). Overall, the median age was 69 years (range, 29\u201392) and 55% were male. Most patients had a good performance status (ECOG 0\u20131) but 18% had an ECOG score of 2\u20134. The median number of previous treatment lines was 2 (1\u20136), 51.5% had 2 previous lines and 24% had 3 or more. Baseline characteristics across treatment groups were similar. Patients receiving lenalidomide had a median treatment duration of 4.4 months; patients receiving bortezomib and thalidomide had 3.4 months and 3.7 months, respectively. NCI grade 3/4, serious and life threatening AEs are presented in the table. Venous thromboembolism was experienced in 5% of lenalidomide-treated patients (3% had grade 3/4); 0.7% of bortezomib-treated patients (0.6% had grade 3/4); 1 (1%) thalidomide-treated patient had grade 3/4. Peripheral neuropathy was observed in 10% of lenalidomide-treated patients (1% had grade 3/4); 28% of bortezomib-treated patients (4% had grade 3/4); and 21% of thalidomide-treated patients (2% had grade 3/4). Ten (0.5%) invasive second primary malignancies (SPM) were reported across all treatment groups; 5/1500 (0.3%) patients treated with lenalidomide, 4/538 (0.7%) with bortezomib, and 1/90 (1%) with thalidomide. Three cases of second primary hematologic malignancies (lenalidomide, 2; bortezomib, 1; thalidomide, none) and 7 cases of second primary solid tumors (lenalidomide, 3; bortezomib, 3; thalidomide, 1) were observed. Additionally in the lenalidomide group, 1 patient each developed a non-invasive basal cell carcinoma and a non-invasive fibrous histiocytoma. All of these patients were heavily pre-treated and most had received autologous stem cell transplantation to support high-dose melphalan during the course of their disease. 51% of patients in the lenalidomide group discontinued therapy while 65% and 71% discontinued bortezomib and thalidomide treatments, respectively. Primary reasons for discontinuation were adverse events (lenalidomide, 13%; bortezomib, 14%; thalidomide, 18%) and disease progression (lenalidomide, 15%; bortezomib, 13%; thalidomide, 17%). Overall, 1% of patients died due to an adverse event suspected to be related to drug (lenalidomide, 1%; bortezomib, 0%; thalidomide, 1%). Conclusion: Consistent with previous reports, lenalidomide is generally well tolerated. With the exception of peripheral neuropathy, adverse events in this group of patients treated in daily clinical practice appeared similar across treatment groups.
