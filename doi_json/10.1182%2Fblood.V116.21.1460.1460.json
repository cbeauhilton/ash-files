    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1460 Many patients with hematologic malignancies choose hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as a treatment option. The most common source of Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells (HSC/HPC) for adult recipients is mobilized Peripheral Blood (mobPB). Limited quantities of HSC/HPC obtainable from an umbilical cord restricts its use for adult recipients . Ex vivo treatment of umbilical cord blood (CB) with cytokines and growth factors is being used to expand the population of cord blood HSC/HPCs in hopes of obtaining higher numbers of transplantable CB cells. In addition, cytokines and growth factors are often utilized post-transplant in an attempt to improve the rate of immune reconstitution. It has been previously reported that granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) up-regulate CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV/DPPIV) activity on freshly isolated CD34 + CB cells within 18 hours of culture [Christopherson, et al . Exp Hematol 2006]. Separate studies have demonstrated that treatment of uncultured CD34 + CB cells with the CD26 inhibitor Diprotin A increases transplant efficiency into immunodeficient mice [Christopherson, et al . Stem Cells Dev . 2007]. We evaluated here the in vitro and in vivo effects of CD26 inhibitor treatment on previously frozen CB CD34 + cells cultured ex vivo with G-CSF, GM-CSF or SCF for 48 hours. We examined CD26 expression by multivariate flow cytometry, CD26 activity using the established chromogenic CD26 substrate, Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide (Gly-Pro-pNA), and SDF-1\u03b1 induced migration and adhesion. In vivo , we examined long-term engraftment in NSG (NOD/SCID/IL2R\u03b3 null ) immunodeficient mice. After 48 hours of culture with cytokine treatment we observed altered CD26 expression on CD34 + CB cells. There was both an increase in the percentage of CD26 + cells and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD26. Additionally, CD26 activity was 1.20, 1.59, 1.58, and 1.65 fold greater after ex vivo culture in untreated, G-CSF, GM-CSF and SCF treated CB CD34 + cells respectively compared to the CD26 activity prior to culture. The increase in CD26 activity as a result of treatment with G-CSF (p\u2264 0.01), GM-CSF (p\u2264 0.05) or SCF (p\u2264 0.01) was significantly higher than the CD26 activity measured in the untreated cells following 48 hours of culture. Post-culture treatment with the CD26 inhibitor, Diprotin A, significantly improved SDF-1\u03b1 induced migration and adhesion of cultured CD34 + CB cells in vitro, particularly in G-CSF treated cells (p\u2264 0.05). Diprotin A treatment of CD34 + CB cells previously treated with G-CSF also significantly increased the long-term in vivo engraftment of stem and progenitor (CD34 + CD38 - , p=0.032), monocyte (CD14 + , p=0.015), and megakaryocyte/platelet (CD61 + , p=0.020) cells in the bone marrow of NSG mice. CD26 has been previously shown to cleave SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor 1/CXCL12). After cleavage, SDF-1 retains its ability to bind to its receptor (CXCR4) but no longer signals. SDF-1 is a powerful chemoattractant and has been shown to be important in mobilization, homing, and engraftment of HSCs and HPCs. This study demonstrates the influence of ex vivo culture and the effect of cytokine treatment on CD26 activity and subsequent biologic function related to HSCT. All three cytokines studied caused a significant increase in enzymatic activity at 48 hours compared to untreated cells. The up-regulation of CD26 protein expression caused by cytokine treatment for 48 hours, in particular G-CSF, had a significant impact on SDF-1 stimulated migration and adhesion. This was demonstrated in vitro by the improvement in cell function after CD26 inhibitor treatment and in vivo by the improved engraftment seen in the G-CSF treated cells with CD26 inhibitor treatment. These experiments suggest that combining CD26 inhibitor treatment following culture with G-CSF treatment during culture has the greatest overall benefit in engraftment outcome. By increasing our understanding of the effects of exogenous cytokines during culture on trafficking, ex vivo expanded CB has the potential to become a more effective means of not only increasing numbers of CB HSC/HPCs but also engraftment outcomes. This would ultimately allow expanded cord blood to become a more viable option for HSCT. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
