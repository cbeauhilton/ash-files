    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2867 Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a clonal hematologic malignancy, which results from the transformation of a pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cell. A major consequence of this transformation is increased hematopoiesis and an overproduction of abnormal blood cells. PMF is associated with bone marrow fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, increased numbers of circulating CD34 + cells, splenomegaly, and a propensity to evolve to AML. Patients also display anemia and thrombocytopenia and harbor abnormal, immature megakaryocytes (Mks) in their bone marrow and spleen. PMF patients can present well known mutations including JAK2V617F (65%), MPL (10%), TET2 (17%), CBL (6%), IDH (4%,), which are not specific to the disease and are also present in polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and AML. We hypothesize that the genetic events associated with PMF, including MPL and JAK2 mutations, contribute to defects in Mk maturation, but that additional changes are needed to explain the striking abnormalities seen in PMF relative to the other myeloproliferative diseases. Although there have been studies to examine the aberrant gene expression program of CD34 + cells of PMF patients, we chose to examine the changes that occur in gene expression specifically in Mks as a way to better understand their abnormal differentiation and to determine their contribution to the disease. Primary CD34 + cells from PMF patients and healthy donors were cultivated in serum free media supplemented with recombinant TPO, BSA, liposomes, insulin and transferrin to support the growth of Mks. After 10 days of differentiation, we evaluated the cultures for proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation by flow cytometry. We found that PMF specimens gave rise to a lower percentage of mature (CD41 + CD42 + ) cells as compared to healthy donors, but showed, a lower ploidy level, a greater proliferation and increased survival. These observations are consistent with the clinical observations that PMF bone marrow is characterized by an increased number of immature, dysplastic Mks. We used flow cytometry to collect two populations of cells for analysis: immature CD41 + CD42 \u2212 Mks, and CD41 + CD42 + mature MKs. After sorting, we extracted RNA and performed whole genome microarray analysis with Illumina Human HT12-v4 arrays on cohorts of PMF and control specimens. Gene expression data were analyzed by GeneSpring and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). We found that the CD41 + CD42 \u2212 MKs derived from PMF progenitors showed reduced expression of GATA1 as compared to control cells, as expected based on previous study by Dr. Alessandro Vannuchi. GeneSpring analysis revealed that myeloid transcription factors, including CEBPa, GFI1, and SPI1 (PU.1), which are not expressed in normal MKs, are strikingly and significantly overexpressed in PMF samples. Moreover, c-myb, which regulates the erythroid/Mk cell fate decision, FOG-1 and AML1, are also overexpressed in PMF Mks. This aberrant myeloid gene expression program in PMF Mks is reminiscent of a similar defect we observed in Mks with reduced expression of GATA-1 and GATA-2. We predict that reduced levels of GATA-1 protein in PMF Mks, as reported by Dr. Alessandro Vannucchi and colleagues, is in part responsible for the aberrant growth and differentiation of the PMF Mks. Our data support the model that PMF Mks are defective in their ability to properly regulate expression of hematopoietic regulators. Further analysis by GSEA revealed that hematopoietic and cytokine pathways are among those that are highly enriched in PMF Mks. We recently reported that the molecules dimethylfasudil (diMF) and MLN9237 are able to selectively increase ploidy, Mk surface marker expression, and apoptosis of malignant Mks. We treated Mks derived from PMF progenitor cells with diMF and observed a high increase in polyploidization accompanied with a reduction of Mks proliferation. Thus, diMF is able to partially restore Mk differentiation of PMF cells, supporting the testing of polyploidy inducers in myelofibrosis patients.
