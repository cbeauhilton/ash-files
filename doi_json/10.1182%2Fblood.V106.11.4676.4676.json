    "abstract_text": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a malignant lymphoma associated with a relatively aggressive clinical course and a median overall survival time of 3\u20134 years. We investigated immunohistochemically the expression of the apoptotic marker caspase 3 in relation to the clinical course. Biopsy specimen from 84 untreated patients enrolled in two multicenter prospective trials were investigated immunohistochemically with monoclonal antibodies against CD20, CD5, CD3, CD23, cyclin D1, Caspase3. The Caspase3 expression was analyzed in three groups: less than 1 positive cell per high power field (HPF), more than 1 positive cell per HPF and more than 2 positive cells per HPF. The expression was compared with the overall survival data analysed according to Kaplan and Meier. In 75 cases the caspase 3 staining could be analyzed. The caspase 3 expression had a range of 0.1\u20134.7 positive cells per HPF (median value:1.1, mean:1.3). Patients with mantle cell lymphoma that had less than 1 caspase 3 positive cell per HPF (33 cases) had a median overall survival time of 48 months compared to 27 months for patients with more than 1 positive cell per HPF (24 cases) and 15 months for more than 2 positive cells per HPF (18). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant difference in the overall survival time between these groups (p<0.0001). The immunohistochemical detection of caspase 3 in mantle cell lymphoma is a predictor for survival in MCL."
