    "abstract_text": "Abstract 646 The advent of imatinib, a Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor revolutionized the treatment for patients with CML. Development of resistance, limited activity in blast crisis CML, and more importantly, insensitivity of quiescent primitive CD34 + CML progenitor cells are evolving problems facing this therapy. Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins were known to be highly expressed in Bcr-Abl expressing cells and inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-X L by the selective inhibitor ABT-737 was reported to augment the killing of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in CML cells. However, its effect on quiescent primitive CD34 + CML progenitor cells is unknown. To investigate the effect of activating the apoptotic machinery in quiescent primitive CD34 + CML progenitor cells, which are resistant to current therapies, we first compared the expression of antiapoptotic proteins in proliferating and quiescent primitive CD34 + CML progenitor cells. Cells obtained from patients with blast crisis CML were stained with the fluorescent 5-(and 6-) carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester, a cell proliferation tracking dye, and cultured in vitro for 4-6 days. Cells were then stained with CD34 antibody and FACS sorted into proliferating and quiescent CD34 + /PI- CML progenitor cells. RNA levels of antiapoptotic proteins in these two cell populations (n=8) were determined by real-time RT-PCR: quiescent and proliferating primitive CD34 + CML progenitor cells expressed similar levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-X L , Mcl-1, and XIAP implying that like total blast cells, quiescent primitive CD34 + CML progenitor cells may also be sensitive to agents targeting these proteins. We next treated 5 samples obtained from patients with blast crisis CML with ABT-737 and measured apoptosis in total CD34 + cells, proliferating CD34 + cells, and quiescent CD34 + cells. All 5 patients were resistant to or relapsed from imatinib and nilotinib and/or dasatinib treatments and they were insensitive to imatinib in vitro as expected. However, cells from 4 patients were sensitive to ABT-737, in bulk blasts and in both proliferating and quiescent CD34 + CML cell compartments: % specific apoptosis with 100 nM of ABT-737=40.8\u00b17.7, 38.4\u00b18.5, 40.0\u00b15.1, respectively at 24 hours. Interestingly, when ABT-737 was combined with imatinib, cell death was greatly enhanced in cells from all 5 patients in all cell compartments (combination index=0.059\u00b10.032, 0.041\u00b10.025, 0.111\u00b10.042, respectively). Furthermore, we showed previously, that triptolide, an antitumor agent from a Chinese herb, induces apoptosis in both proliferating and quiescent primitive CD34 + CML progenitor cells by decreasing Mcl-1 which is a resistant factor for ABT-737, XIAP, and Bcr-Abl protein levels (Mak D. et al., MCT in press). When ABT-737 was combined with triptolide, a significant increase of cell death was found in total CD34 + and proliferating as well as quiescent primitive CD34 + CML cells with combination index at EC50=0.57, 0.55, and 0.56, respectively in cells from the 5 patients suggesting a high degree of synergism. In summary, Bcl-2, Bcl-X L , Mcl-1, and XIAP are equally expressed in proliferating and quiescent primitive CML cells and targeting Bcl-2/Bcl-X L promotes death of blast crisis CML cells, tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistant CML cells, and quiescent primitive CD34 + CML progenitor cells. Researches suggest that the combination of apoptosis inducing agents and tyrosine kinase inhibitor is a novel strategy to overcome tyrosine kinase resistance, eradicate quiescent primitive CML progenitor cells, and improve current therapy for patients with CML.
