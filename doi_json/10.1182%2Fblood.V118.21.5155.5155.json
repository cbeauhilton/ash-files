    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5155 Patients with newly diagnosed essential thrombocythemia (ET) were investigated for selective accumulation/expansion of CD4+ lymphocytes subpopulations in the marrow, to verifie the hypothesis that the neoplastic process associated factor(s) are recognized by the immune system. Sixteen patients (F/M: 12/4, age 28\u201372 - median 60 yrs) with ET diagnosed according to the WHO criteria were studied. They had platelets from 496\u2013809 x 10\u03023/ul (median 644 \u00d7 10\u03023 ), (12 heterozygotes, 2 homozygotes). Cytological evaluation revealed normal differentiation of erythroid and myeloid lineages, in contrast an increased number of megakaryocytes often enlarged, hyperlobulated and in clusters were seen in all patients. Trephine biopsy revealed activation of megakaryopoiesis with enlarged numerous megakaryocytes with normal representation of other lineages and a lack of an increase in the reticulin fibers. Marrow cellularity was from 9 \u2013 126 x10\u03023/ul (median 42 \u00d7 10\u03023/ul). The whole populations of marrow and blood cells were labeled for a purpose of this study with the use CD4, CD25, CD45RO and CCR7 MoAb (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, UmarSA) followed by detection and analysis with the use of flow cytometry (FACS Calibur, Becton Dickinson) equipped with PCLysis programe. Immunostaining of trephine biopsies was used for detection of FOXP3 cells. It was found: (i) Lymphocytes in the marrow were in proportions from 4,5%-15,7% (median 7,25%), in numbers from1377/ul to 8245/ul (median 3870/ul) what was significantly higher as compared to blood from 1300/ul to 3900/ul (median 2100/ul) (Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Test, p=0.010). (ii) CD45RO+CCR7- lymphocytes were higher in numbers in the marrow aspirates as compared to blood (median 1281/ul vs 631,2/ul, p=0,04 Wilcoxon Test for pairs). (iii) In contrast numbers in the marrow aspirates of CD45 RO-CCR7+ (median 297,4/ul vs median 238,2/ul), as well as CD45 RO+CCR7+ (median 149,6/ul vs 146,4/ul) did not differ from those in blood. (iv) It was a significant increase of CD4+CD25high+ cells in the marrow aspirates as compared to blood (median 36,2/ul vs 9,1/ul; p=0,02 Wilcoxon Test for pairs). Indeed in 11 out of 14 trephine biopsies investigated FoxP3+ cells were identified. In conclusion an increase, in the marrow of ET patients, of effector/memory CD4 lymphocytes (CD45RO+CCR7-) but not those of nai\u0308ve and central memory lymphocytes phenotypes points out on the selective accumulation of these cells in the marrows. Concomitant increase of T regulatory cells (CD4+CD25+high) suggests that an active immunological is taking place at the site. It is possible that effector memory cells are attracted to come to the marrows by ET process associated factors and if so the present observation constitute the primary observation building the rationale behind immunotherapy in ET patients Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
