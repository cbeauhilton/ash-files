Therefore, to investigate whether the tumour cells in MM generate and/or expand T Reg cells as a method of immuno-surveillance avoidance, we developed an in vitro model of T Reg cell generation. Materials and Methods: PBMCs from PB of healthy donors were co-cultured with human myeloma cell line, U266B, for 7 days. Using a sequential gating strategy, T Reg cells identified as CD4 + /CD25 + / FoxP3 + T-cells were expressed as a percentage of the CD4 + T-cell population. Experiments were repeated after CD25 depletion \u00b1 CD4 selection and using transwells to examine cell contact dependence. The tumour generated T Reg cells (tT Reg cells) were isolated on day 7 by FACS and compared with naturally occurring T Reg cells (nT Reg cells). Results: Co-culture of unselected PBMC's demonstrated a non-significant increase in T Reg cells compared with controls (n=8; controls 3.8\u00b10.8%, co-culture 6.7\u00b11%, p=0.06). However, co-culture of CD4 + CD25 \u2212 T-cells with U266 resulted in a significant increase in tT Reg cells (n=15; control 0.6\u00b10.3%; co-culture 31.5\u00b13.6%, p<0.0001). tT Reg cell generation was abrogated when contact was prevented (n=7; control 0.17\u00b10.05%; co-culture 30.6\u00b14.9%; addition of transwell 0.1\u00b10.04%, p=0.009). TCR analysis by PCR on tT Reg cells revealed a polyclonal nature of those cells. Blocking experiments with anti-IL-10, anti-ICOS-L & anti-TGFb, in addition to the TGFb-specific antagonist, LAP, did not show any reduction in tT Reg cell generation. tT Reg cells demonstrated full suppressive capabilities in a functional suppression assay. Phenotypically, tT Reg cells demonstrated altered expression of key proteins: FoxP3 MFI was significantly lower (925 \u00b1 47 vs. 1960 \u00b1 109 in nT Reg cells, p=0.0001), GITR expression was significantly higher (70\u00b14% vs. 10\u00b12.8%, p<0.0001) and PD1 expression was significantly higher (50\u00b19% vs. 5.2\u00b10.8%, p=0.003). CD-62L expression was lower in tT Reg cells (88\u00b12% vs. 97\u00b10.5%, p=0.007). When tT Reg cells were isolated by FACS on day 7 and stimulated for a further 5 days with IL-2 and CD3/CD28 coated beads, differentiation to FoxP + /IL-17 + and FoxP3 \u2212 /IL-17 + CD4 + cells was demonstrated with similar efficiency to nT Reg cells (2.6\u00b11.8% vs 3.6\u00b12.4% p=0.7 and 4.6\u00b14.0% vs 4.5\u00b13.8% p=0.8, respectively). The addition of U266 pre-treated with thalidomide, lenalidomide and an HDAC inhibitor for 24 hours prior to co-culture demonstrated that thalidomide and HDAC inhibition significantly reduced the generation even at a low concentrations (42.6\u00b124.5% without vs. 20.7\u00b111.9% with thalidomide, p=0.009 and 9.8\u00b13.3% with HDAC inhibition, p=0.003), whereas the addition of lenalidomide did not influence tT Reg cell generation. Conclusions: The tumour cells of MM directly generate fully functional T Reg cells in a contact dependent manner independent of known inducing cytokines and ligands. This is an active process under epigenetic control. The exact mechanism of induction is under investigation. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
