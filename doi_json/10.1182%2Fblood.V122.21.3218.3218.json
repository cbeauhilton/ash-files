    "abstract_text": "Background Thalidomide and its immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) derivatives such as lenalidomide (LEN) have shown great promise as treatment options for multiple myeloma (MM) patients (pts). Pomalidomide (POM) is a newer IMiD with high in vitro anti-MM potency that has shown promise as an effective treatment option for relapsed/refractory (R/R) MM pts. Recent data has shown POM to be effective in combination with dexamethasone (DEX), even for patients who are refractory to bortezomib and lenalidomide (Richardson et al , 2012). It has been demonstrated that the addition of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) to lenalidomide and thalidomide is effective for both R/R and frontline MM pts (Offidani et al , 2006; 2007). Our recent trial evaluating lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone, PLD, and bortezomib (DVD-R) showed that both efficacy and tolerability may be improved by changing the doses and schedules of these drugs (Berenson et al , 2012). These results imply that the combination of POM, DEX and PLD may be an effective regimen for treating R/R MM pts. We conducted a phase 1/2 trial investigating the safety and efficacy of POM in combination with IV DEX and PLD using our modified dose, schedule, and longer 28-day cycle for pts with R/R MM. Methods For enrollment into the phase 1 portion of the study, eligible pts had to show progressive MM at the time of enrollment. For participation in the phase 2 portion, pts had to be refractory to LEN (singe-agent or in combination) demonstrated by progressive disease while receiving this IMiD or relapsed within 8 weeks of their last dose. Pts who received previous POM treatment were ineligible. During the phase 1 part of the trial, POM was administered orally at 2, 3, or 4 mg daily in 3 successive cohorts of 3 pts each on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle. DEX (40 mg intravenously over 30 min) and PLD (5 mg/m 2 infused over 30-90 min) both were given on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each cycle. POM doses were escalated per cohort until maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached. Phase 2 patients were all enrolled at what was established as the MTD. Results As of July 9, 2013, 33 pts were registered: 11 and 22 enrolled in the phase 1 and 2 portions, respectively. Fifteen patients have discontinued treatment thus far and 18 remain active. Pts had received a median of 5 prior treatments (range, 1-18) with a median of 1 prior PLD regimen (range, 0-2) and 1 prior IMiD regimen (range, 0-4). Pts have completed a median of 4 cycles (range: 0-8) with a median of 3.2 months of follow up (range: 0-9.7). During the phase 1 portion, no dose-limiting toxicities were identified, so the highest administered dose of 4 mg was initially established as the MTD. However, neutropenia \u2265 G3 was observed in 10/17 phase 2 pts (58.8%) at this dose; and, as a result, the protocol was amended so that the MTD was lowered to 3 mg for all phase 2 pts beyond the 29 th pt (n = 4). Thirty-two pts have received study drug. Twenty-nine pts were evaluable for response at data cutoff as 3 were active but had not yet had any post-baseline disease assessments. Of the 29 considered evaluable, overall response rate and clinical benefit rates were 34.5% and 48.3%, respectively, Six pts (20.7%) showed stable disease while 8 (27.6%) pts exhibited progressive disease. There was \u2265 grade 3 (G3) neutropenia in 12 (37.5%) pts. Two pts experienced this toxicity during the phase 1 portion (3 mg and 4 mg doses- 1 each) whereas the other 10 pts experienced this side effect at the 4 mg dose during phase 2 enrollment. Following the lowering of the MTD to 3 mg due to this issue, neutropenia (\u2265 G3) has not been observed to date. Other treatment-emergent AEs \u2265 G3 occurring in more than 1 pt were leukopenia in 12 (37.5%), lymphopenia in 8 (25%), anemia in 3 (9.4%), hyponatremia in 3 (9.4%), thrombocytopenia in 2 (6.3%), and duodenal ulcers in 1 (3.4%) pts. One pt died during treatment due to sepsis. Conclusions Results from this phase 1/2 trial demonstrate that the combination of pomalidomide with dexamethasone and PLD using a 28-day cycle shows efficacy for MM pts with progressive disease who are refractory to lenalidomide. Notably, less neutropenia has been observed at the 3 mg dose of pomalidomide, with 4 mg POM dosing associated with a high incidence of \u2265 G3 neutropenia when used in this three-drug combination.
