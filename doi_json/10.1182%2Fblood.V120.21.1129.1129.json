    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1129 Background: Von Willebrand disease (vWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder in the United States, affecting about 1\u20132 % of the population. It is generally inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and is equally prevalent in males and females. Though this disorder usually manifests as mucosal bleeding, it is well known that there is a wide variation in clinical severity. The symptoms of vWD are usually more obvious in women because of menstruation and labor/delivery; and may be significantly under recognized in men. The pattern of bleeding and presentation at diagnosis in males has previously only been described in a small population of type 1 vWD patients (pts). Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of active male pts with vWD receiving care at the Comprehensive Hemophilia Treatment Center. Clinical information such as age at diagnosis, initial symptom prompting the diagnosis and clinical bleeding history was obtained. Invasive procedures were reviewed for bleeding complications and relevant hematological intervention. Relevant laboratory data like PT, PTT, von Willebrand antigen (vWF:Ag), von Willebrand ristocetin cofactor (vWF:RCoF) and factor VIII activity (FVIII:C) was noted. Results: We identified a total of 140 male subjects with the diagnosis of vWD. Of the 140, 85 were evaluable with complete data. The mean age of the pts at the time of the study is 19 years (yrs) (1\u201379 yrs). 76/85 (89%) are type 1, 6/85 (7%) type 2 and 2/85 (4%) type 3 vWD. The mean age at diagnosis was 9.7 yrs (0.5\u201360 yrs) with 62/85 (73%) being diagnosed at age \u2264 10 yrs. The most common initial presentations leading to the diagnosis of vWD were epistaxis (25/85; 29%), a positive family history (24/85; 28%), prolonged preoperative (preop) PTT (14/85; 16%), easy bruising (10/85; 12%) and postoperative (postop) bleeding (5/85; 6%) pts. The mean lab values of vWF:Ag 48 IU/dl, vWF:RCoF 45 IU/dl and FVIII:C 62 IU/dl. 25/85 (29%) pts have one of the above parameters measuring < 30 IU/dl. Among those who ever experienced bleeding, the most common manifestations were epistaxis (30/85; 35%), easy bruising (10/85; 12%), postop bleeding (10/85; 8%), hemarthrosis (4/85; 5%), hematuria and oral bleeds (3/85; 4% each). A total of 48 surgical procedures occurred, consisting of 18 dental procedures, 13 tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy (T/A), 7 circumcisions, 5 joint surgeries, 2 port placements and 1 each of cystoscopy, orchiopexy and heart surgery. Bleeding complications were common 10/48 (21%): 5 with dental procedures, 2 each with T/A and circumcision and 1 with cystoscopy; all occurring in the absence of prophylactic treatment and 2/10 (20%) complications requiring transfusion of blood products. Conclusions: In our study which included types 1, 2 and 3 vWD pts, the majority of male subjects were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis, whereas about 40% were brought to attention due to a positive family history or an abnormal preop screening test. As opposed to previous reports, postop bleeding was a rare initial presentation in our larger cohort, possibly due to improved preop screening and earlier diagnosis. The most common pattern of bleeding amongst the symptomatic pts was mucosal, in the form of epistaxis and easy bruising. Bleeding complications can occur with invasive procedures, so aggressive use of DDAVP or clotting factor concentrates is warranted in a pt with known diagnosis of vWD.
