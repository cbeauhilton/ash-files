    "abstract_text": "Development of immature T cells in the thymus requires signals through the clonotypic T cell receptor (TCR). Thymocytes expressing a functionally inactive or autoreactive TCR are deleted via apoptosis (negative selection). Thymocytes expressing a functionally active but not autoreactive TCR are selected through inhibition of cell death (positive selection). Deregulation of this process is likely to result in autoimmunity or lymphomagenesis of T cells. The intracellular mechanisms by which the balance between TCR-dependent survival and apoptosis are regulated are largely unknown. A central regulator of survival and apoptosis in the immune system is the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. Activation of NF-\u03baB in mature T-cells requires the adaptor proteins Bcl10 and Malt1. Using gene-targeted mice deficient for Bcl10 or Malt1, we show that Bcl10 and Malt1 are also required for TCR-induced NF-\u03baB activation in immature T cells. Furthermore, to elucidate the process of T cell selection within the thymus, we have crossed Bcl10 or Malt1 deficient mice into mice with genetic backgrounds expressing defined TCR transgenes. Using specific peptide agonists of these TCR transgenes, we show that neither in vivo nor in vitro development into single positive (SP) CD4 or CD8 positive T cells is altered in Bcl10 or Malt1 deficient mice. Absolute numbers and ratio of SP T cells found within the thymus or in peripheral lymphnodes of transgenic animals are normal. These findings indicate that Bcl10 and Malt1 activate NF-\u03baB in thymocytes but are dispensable for maturation of immature T cells in this model system.",
