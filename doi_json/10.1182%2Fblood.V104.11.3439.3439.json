    "abstract_text": "The high affinity Fc\u03b3receptor Fc\u03b3RI, consists of a ligand binding \u03b1 chain and an associated \u03b3 chain subunit. Signaling by Fc\u03b3RI is thought to be mediated through the cytoplasmic domain (CYT) of the \u03b3 chain which contains the ITAM sequence essential for many Ig receptor signaling events. For example, we have demonstrated that the \u03b3 chain is required for Fc\u03b3RI mediated phagocytosis. The Fc\u03b3RI \u03b1 chain CYT lacks known signaling motifs and consists of 64 amino acids whose function has not yet been defined. Evidence is beginning to accumulate, however, for the participation of the Fc\u03b3RI\u03b1 CYT in Fc\u03b3RI mediated signaling events. For example, we previously demonstrated that the Fc\u03b3RI\u03b1 CYT contributes to modulation of Fc\u03b3RI mediated cytokine release (eg IL-6) and calcium flux. We have now observed that in the absence of \u03b3chain expression, Fc\u03b3RI\u03b1 efficiently induces the internalization of aggregated IgG complexes in transfected COS-1 cells. Taken together, the data suggest that the Fc\u03b3RI\u03b1 CYT contributes to signaling by Fc\u03b3RI. We, therefore, utilized yeast two-hybrid screening to identify effector molecules that bind to the Fc\u03b3RI\u03b1 CYT. Of especial interest among the identified binding molecules is \u03b2 arrestin-2, recently defined as an adaptor molecule linking receptors such as the LDL and type III TGF-\u03b2 receptors to the endocytic pathway. Also of interest is Snapin, an adaptor molecule involved in membrane trafficking. These studies should help to define sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of Fc\u03b3RI\u03b1 that mediate and/or modulate important Fc\u03b3R functions."
