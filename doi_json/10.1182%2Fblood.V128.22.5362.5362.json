    "abstract_text": "Objectives: To evaluate the therapeutic response to treatment with transcriptional therapy that combines hydralazine / valproate(Transkrip) in cancer patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma Determine toxicity, duration of response and time to progression of epigenetic therapy with hydralazine / valproate in patients with T-cell lymphomas Material and methods an open-label, phase II, prospective and longitudinal in the National Cancer Institute of Mexico was carried out, recruiting patients diagnosed with Cutaneous T based on WHO classification 2008, newly diagnosed untreated, demographic data were analyzed and vital and somatometry signs, assessment of efficacy was established according to the therapeutic response in lymphomas measured at each visit at the affected sites for each patient, using the m-SWAT system sorted in complete response (CR), partial response (PR ), stable disease (SD) and progression (PE) and is considered response to patients with complete or partial response, these data were collected in the form of case report at baseline in the first consultation, during treatment and at the end the study at each visit to the doctor. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 13.0 software. results 16 patients were selected with diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, one patients discontinued the study at baseline and 4 patients had disease progression during the first months of the study, a total of 10 patients who completed 18 months of study continuing the compassionate use treatment. The median age of patients was 45.8 years analyzed (18-83 years) of which 8 are women (53%) and 7 men (47%) with an ECOG 1 in 93.3% of patients, with an average weight of 72.5 \u00b1 15.99 kg, height 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 m, body mass index 28.3 \u00b1 5.7 kg / m2, 46.7% of overweight patients, systolic blood pressure an average of 116.2 \u00b1 14.3 mmHg and diastolic 75.1 \u00b1 11.04 mmHg with respiratory rate 19.43 \u00b1 1.74 resp / min and 77.8 \u00b1 12.3 cardiac beats / min. Of the 10 patients who completed the study, 100% had complete or partial response itching to 6 month continuing unchanged at month 18, the dream as an adverse event occurred in 33% of patients, this being more frequent, adverse events attributed to the drug were known, expected and mild. From 6 months of treatment, the percentage of partial response and complete response of m-SWAT and pruritus were greater than 90% of patients. conclusions: Hydralazine/Valproate (Transkrip) is a medication that offers patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, both first-line and refractory, a therapeutic alternative with high efficiency and good safety profile.
