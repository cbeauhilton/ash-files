Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 13.0 software. results 16 patients were selected with diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, one patients discontinued the study at baseline and 4 patients had disease progression during the first months of the study, a total of 10 patients who completed 18 months of study continuing the compassionate use treatment. The median age of patients was 45.8 years analyzed (18-83 years) of which 8 are women (53%) and 7 men (47%) with an ECOG 1 in 93.3% of patients, with an average weight of 72.5 \u00b1 15.99 kg, height 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 m, body mass index 28.3 \u00b1 5.7 kg / m2, 46.7% of overweight patients, systolic blood pressure an average of 116.2 \u00b1 14.3 mmHg and diastolic 75.1 \u00b1 11.04 mmHg with respiratory rate 19.43 \u00b1 1.74 resp / min and 77.8 \u00b1 12.3 cardiac beats / min. Of the 10 patients who completed the study, 100% had complete or partial response itching to 6 month continuing unchanged at month 18, the dream as an adverse event occurred in 33% of patients, this being more frequent, adverse events attributed to the drug were known, expected and mild. From 6 months of treatment, the percentage of partial response and complete response of m-SWAT and pruritus were greater than 90% of patients. conclusions: Hydralazine/Valproate (Transkrip) is a medication that offers patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, both first-line and refractory, a therapeutic alternative with high efficiency and good safety profile.
