    "abstract_text": "Glanzmann Thrombasthenia (GT) is a recessively inherited bleeding disorder caused by the quantitative or qualitative deficiency of integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23. The recent solution of the crystal structure of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 revealed that the N-terminal domain of \u03b1IIb is folded in a complex structure, a \u03b2-propeller formed by seven blades. The role of the \u03b2-propeller is to bind fibrinogen and to associate to \u03b23. In the endoplasmic reticulum pro-\u03b1IIb associates with \u03b23, it is then transferred to the Golgi, where it is cleaved in two chains disulfide bonded (mature \u03b1IIb); mutations that impair the association of pro-\u03b1IIb to \u03b23 are able to cause GT. The architecture of the propeller is sustained by several prolines that stabilize the entire structure. From molecular modeling studies it had been postulated that the residue spatially adjacent to proline 258 can only be a glycine because there is no physical space for other residues. Analyzing the GT mutations of Italian patients recently described by D\u2019Andrea et al. (Thromb Haemost., 2002) we found that a patient with type I GT had a \u03b1IIb G236E missense substitution, hence we decided to verify if the substitution of glycine 236 was hampering \u03b1IIb \u03b23 association. The G236E mutation was introduced by site directed mutagenesis in pCDNA3.1 containing normal human \u03b1IIb cDNA. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were transfected either with normal or mutated \u03b1IIb in conjunction with pCDNA3.1 containing normal \u03b23. By flow cytometry analysis the percentage of HEK cells transfected with \u03b1IIbG236E\u03b23 that reacted with 10E5-FITC (anti \u03b1IIb\u03b23) was 7\u00b11% while the percentage of cells transfected with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 that reacted with 10E5-FITC was 37\u00b113%. When the binding of an antibody directed against \u03b23 (VIPL-2-FITC) was evaluated, we observed that cells expressing \u03b1IIbG236E\u03b23 did bind the antibody, indicating that the normal transfected \u03b23 was associating with the endogenous \u03b1V. HEK cells transfected with either \u03b1IIb\u03b23 or \u03b1IIbG236E\u03b23 were lysed; cells lysates were analysed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Both lysates were reacting at the same level with antibodies directed against \u03b23. When immunoblotting was done in non-reducing conditions utilizing an antibody reacting with \u03b1IIb (mab1990) a band corresponding to \u03b1IIb was present in both lysates, although less intense in cells transfected with \u03b1IIbG236E\u03b23. In reducing condition \u03b1IIb from cells transfected with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 was nearly all mature, while in cells transfected with \u03b1IIbG236E\u03b23 the ratio pro-\u03b1IIb: \u03b1IIb was 1:1. Moreover, when tested against lysates of cells transfected with \u03b1IIbG236E\u03b23, the antibody against \u03b1IIb recognized multiple bands of lower molecular weight, presumably degradation products of the mutated protein. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies against \u03b1IIb or \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and immunoblotted with an antibody reacting with \u03b23. While in immunoblots from cells transfected with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 a band corresponding to \u03b23 was strongly detectable, in immunoblots originating from cells transfected with \u03b1IIbG236E\u03b23 a very weak band at the same level of normal \u03b23 was detected only in immunoprecipitates using 10E5, a complex dependent antibody. In conclusion we demonstrated that \u03b1IIbG236E is a mutation that causes GT by impairing the association with \u03b23 in the endoplasmic reticulum; the effect of the mutation is likely to create a severe misfold of the \u03b2-propeller and the molecular modeling prediction of the need of a glycine at position 236 is probably confirmed."
