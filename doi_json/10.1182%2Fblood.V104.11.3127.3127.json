    "abstract_text": "Staging of mycosis fungoides/Se\u0301zary syndrome (MF/SS), the most common cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), is primarily based on the type and extent of skin involvement and the presence or absence of extracutaneous disease. In patients with large cell transformation, tumors, erythroderma, or abnormal lymph nodes on physical exam, staging includes CT scan to look for visceral or lymph node (LN) disease followed by biopsy of enlarged LN. Integrated PET/CT combines anatomic data from CT with functional data from PET and has been useful in the staging of many non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas. To date, however, its role in staging MF/SS has not been investigated. We assessed the utility of integrated PET/CT in staging thirteen patients with MF (T2=1,T3=4,T4=1) or SS (T4B2=7) at high-risk for LN disease. Based on anatomic data from the CT component alone, only five of thirteen had enlarged LN (axillary/inguinal LN short axis \u22651.5cm or cervical LN short axis \u22651.0cm) and would have been referred for biopsy. In comparison, PET showed that all thirteen patients had hypermetabolic activity in at least one LN region. All patients had excisional LN biopsy and the extent of LN involvement was classified according to NCI criteria (LN1-4 classification). Six patients had LN1-3 and seven had effacement of LN architecture by lymphoma cells (LN4). Of the seven LN4 patients, four had SS and three had tumor MF. PET/CT helped identify the most suspicious LN region for biopsy, which led to the accurate stage of IVA. Notably, two patients had LN smaller than the CT size criteria and would have been incorrectly staged without the use of integrated PET/CT. Furthermore, we quantified the intensity of PET activity using standardized uptake value (SUV) and correlated this with LN grade. Patients with LN1-3 had a mean SUV of 2.7, median 2.2 (2.0\u20134.7) and patients with LN4 had a mean SUV of 5.4, median 3.9 (2.1\u2013 11.8); p value 0.08. Ongoing analysis of additional patients may further define whether PET/CT can be used to significantly differentiate between LN1-3 vs LN4. Thus, for staging MF/SS, integrated PET/CT was more sensitive and specific in detecting malignant LN compared to CT alone and consequently provided more accurate staging and prognostic information. A larger scale study would be essential to confirm the superior staging capability of PET/CT over CT alone in MF/SS. Summary of PET/CT correlation with LN pathology results in MF/SS  Patient .
