    "abstract_text": "In humans, interleukin 7 (IL-7) receptor (IL-7R) deficiency causes approximately 10% of cases of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). IL-7R deficient SCID is a T-B+NK+ SCID and is caused by autosomal recessive deficiency of the IL-7R alpha chain gene ( IL7R) . IL-7R is a heterodimeric receptor comprised of the alpha chain and the IL-2 receptor common gamma chain ( IL2RG) . In both mouse and human, IL-7R is a marker of the common lymphoid progenitor cell, and IL-7 signaling leads to STAT5 phosphorylation and proliferation of developing T and B cells. Mice lacking IL7R, Il7r -/- , lack both T and B cells (Peschon, JJ, et al . J Exp Med. 1994). T cells do not progress to TCR beta chain rearrangement and B cell development is halted at the pre-pro-B cell stage. Similar to the mouse, IL-7 signaling in humans is required for T cell receptor beta gene rearrangement and T cell maintenance, however humans lacking IL-7R can develop B cells. A prior attempt to rescue murine IL-7R deficiency utilized a retroviral vector (mouse stem cell virus, MSCV), the MSCV retroviral promoter, and the murine Il7r gene (Jiang, Q, et al.  Gene Therapy . 2005). This strategy did restore T cells and had variable restoration of B cells. However, retroviral-based gene addition of Il7r led to a myeloproliferative condition with significant neutrophilia and splenomegaly. Transduced bone marrow cells formed myeloid progenitors in response to IL-7 in vitro . We evaluated a novel gene therapy for IL-7R deficient SCID that utilizes the human IL7R gene. To prevent lineage skewing, we sought to limit ectopic expression of IL7R in non-lymphoid cells by utilizing the endogenous enhancers and promoters of IL7R. These sequences were identified as sites of high sequence conservation across species and DNA accessibility/hypersensitivity (DHS) in human lymphocytes. We are testing these sequences alone or in combination with the constitutive phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (PGK) in VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vectors (LV): vPGK_DHS_hIL7R and vDHS_hIL7R. Here we present the first data evaluating the ability of the human IL-7R protein to functionally replace the murine IL-7R protein and the ability of IL7R gene addition to rescue the murine Il7r -/- immunodeficient phenotype in vivo. Transduction of Il7r -/- bone marrow cells with IL7R encoding LV rescued the formation of lymphocyte precursors from murine bone marrow cells in colony forming unit (CFU) assays (pre-B CFU with human IL-7), with the most robust response seen with vPGK_DHS_hIL7R. Mouse bone marrow from Il7r -/- animals transduced ex vivo engrafted in lethally irradiated (8 Gy) Il7r -/- oppositegender recipients and there were no significant aberrations in absolute neutrophil count, hemoglobin or platelet count. Absolute lymphocyte counts in mice receiving transduced Il7r -/- bone marrow cells was higher (mean 2555/\u03bcL) than in mice receiving untransduced bone marrow (mean 1410/\u03bcL). The proportion of leukocytes that were T cells was 4.2-fold and 9.8-fold higher at 1 and 2 months post-transplant, respectively. B cells were only seen in mice receiving vPGK_DHS_hIL7R: 7.4% of leukocytes versus 1.5% in controls. A reciprocal decrease in the fraction of Gr1+ cells (neutrophils and monocytes) was seen at two months post-transplant in transduced marrow recipients compared to untransduced controls: 36.5% versus 63% Gr1+, respectively. Lymphocyte subsets are being further analyzed, bone marrow and thymic lymphoid precursors assessed, and T and B cell function in response to immunizations are in progress. Further evaluation in human derived IL7R deficient human cells is warranted. For individuals with IL-7R deficient SCID, but no HLA matched hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor, there is a difficult choice between the risks of GVHD with a mismatched HSC donor and supportive care with the hope of identifying a matched HSC donor in the future. In immunodeficiencies however age and serious infection are both associated with increased mortality (Pai, SY, et al . NJEM . 2014). This novel approach to IL7R gene replacement has the potential to be a therapeutic and expedient option for those without a matched donor. Additionally, this would be an ideal disorder for HSC conditioning with less toxic, HSC-targeted strategies given gene corrected lymphocytes and progenitors will preferentially expand post-transplant.
