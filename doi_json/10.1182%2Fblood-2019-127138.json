    "abstract_text": "Background: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) management in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated with flotetuzumab, an investigational CD123xCD3 bispecific DART \u00ae molecule for T cell redirected therapy. CRS is a hallmark of T cell activating therapy and can be correlated with efficacy, specifically, with CAR-T cells(1). Identification of patients at risk for high grade CRS will help guide CRS management. Flotetuzumab (MGD006) is anovel CD123xCD3 bispecific DART \u00ae molecule in Phase 1/2 testing in patients with relapsed/ refractory AML. Several strategies have been successfully employed to mitigate CRS severity, some have been previously reported (2, 3). Here we report on further refinement of CRS management and subsequent investigation of potentiel predictive biomarkers of severity. Methods: The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of flotetuzumab is 500ng/kg/d CIV. Week 1 comprises a step-wise lead-in dose (LID) (1-step: 100 ng/kg/day days 1-4; 2-step: 30ng/kg/d for 3days, 100ng/kg/d for 4days, or multi-step (MS) LID at 30, 60, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 ng/kg/day each for 24 hours) in order to improve flotetuzumab tolerability. Tocilizumab usage recommended early in CRS management. The relationships between immune cells (T-cell subsets, monocytes) and tumor burden (percent CD123+ AML blasts, CD123 expression) were further interrogated as potential determinants of CRS. Results: 50 patients have been treated at the RP2D. While almost all patients experienced IRR/CRS events, the majority of these patients experienced IRR/CRS that were mild-moderate in severity (28% Grade(G)1, 62% G2, and 8% G3), of short duration (median 1 day for G1, 2 days G2, 2.5 days G3), and resolved completely with no clinical sequalae reported. Most CRS events occured in the first week of treatment (38.3%) and gradually decreased with continuous dosing (24.8%, 7.4%, and 4.3% during weeks 2-4, respectively). Several key interventions have helped mitigate CRS severity. Sequential increment in steps of LID schedules (1 step, 2-step or multi-step LID) have successfully decreased CRS severity and incidence. For example, CRS mean grade\u00b1SEM for week 1 was 2.0\u00b10.26 vs 1.4\u00b10.72 vs 1.5\u00b10.63 and for week 4, 0.67\u00b10.42 vs 0.2 \u00b10.50 vs 0.1 \u00b10.50 (1 step, 2-step or multi-step LID, respectively). Moreover, LID improved overall tolerability. Introduction of early use of tocilizumab has helped forestall CRS development; 27 patients received tocilizumab (10 doses for G1, 27 for G2, and 2 for G3 events), only 5 pts have required steroids (4 for G2 and 1 for G3), and no pts have required vasopressor support. Blunting of CRS events did not impact antileukemic activity. CRS severity showed a relationship with baseline frequency of circulating CD4+ cells (mean 0.2 K/\u00b5L in patients with no CRS vs. 1.0 K/\u00b5L in G1 vs 1.6 K/\u00b5L in G \u22652, p < 0.000.1), and peak CRS grade in week 1. Conclusion: Like other T-cell activating therapies, flotetuzumab is associated with CRS. Several mitigating factors have helped to blunt the severity of CRS, including lead-in dosing and early tocilizumab usage. Circulating CD4+ cells at baseline continues to be associated with CRS risk, and may be a helpful marker to identify patients at increased risk for CRS. 1. Maude, SL. et al .
