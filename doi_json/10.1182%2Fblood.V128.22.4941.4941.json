    "abstract_text": "Introduction. Primary immune thrombocytopenia is a rare disease 1 . The incidence of ITP is not well estimated in Russia and worldwide. In adults it varies from 1,6 to 3,9/100 000 person-years 2-3 . The gender and age-associated results are discussed and differ in several investigations 4-6 . Study objectives: evaluation of the incidence of primary immune thrombocytopenia in adults in one region of Russia Patients and methods. The data source is the Registry of the patients with primary ITP in Russia. 272 adult patients: 77 males (28%) and 195 females (72%), age from 16 to 89 years (median 44 years) with ITP (ICD-10 code D69.3), newly diagnosed cases during the period from 12 Jan 2014 to 24 May 2016. Results. 221 (81%) cases were newly diagnosed in 12 regions of Russia in which registration was performed most actively - more than 5 cases for the duration of the study. But only one region was selected for the first evaluation of epidemiological characteristics because of the number of reasons. There is one hematological central clinic in this region in which diagnosis of ITP can be verified and patients with ITP are treated and monitored most properly. The early started and fully performed registration process can be regarded as covered most part of region population in this target region. 86 cases (27 male, 59 female) were registered in the target region. The gender-age distribution was following: male: age 60 = 10 (37%); female: age 60 = 15 (25%). The estimated incidence rate in the target region is shown in table 1. The estimated incidence rates in gender-age strata in the target region are demonstrated in table 2. Conclusion. Overall ITP incidence in one region of Russia is 3.20/100 000 person-years. It is compatible to the incidence in other European countries. Our data demonstrate the rise of incidence rate in males with age and its decrease with age in female population.
