    "abstract_text": "Recently, a new class of RNAs has been identified that, like mRNAs, are usually transcribed by RNA polymerase II, but lack significant translated open reading frames. They are non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that exert roles directly as RNAs, and function as genetic regulators, or riboregulators. In the present study, we discovered a novel very large ncRNA. From differential gene profiling of CD31 positive tumor microvascular endothelial cells from a murine colon carcinoma, we amplified an ~380 bp nucleotide sequence, DP100. This RNA was present in tumor cells as well as tumor vascular endothelium. The full-length DP100 transcript is an ~7 Kb RNA lacking an open reading frame set for more than 66 amino acids. Also the hypothetically predicted proteins lacked significant similarity to known proteins, consistent with identity of DP100 as an unusually large non-coding RNA transcript. Further bioinformatic search demonstrated that the full-length DP100 sequence is highly homologous to the human alpha gene, which encodes an 8.5 Kb, non-coding RNA transcript, and is located in a region implicated in chromosomal abnormalities of human tumors. The full-length DP100, here designated the mouse alpha gene, is evolutionally highly conserved among vertebrates, suggesting its functional significance. The role for this ncRNA in cellular behavior is under investigation.",
