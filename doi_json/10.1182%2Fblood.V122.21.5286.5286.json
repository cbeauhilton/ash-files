    "abstract_text": "The contribution of the immune system to the pathogenesis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) have been receiving growing attention. The increase of cancer risk in immunodeficient individuals has been documented in population and experimental studies ( Gurlich et al 2007; Swann et al 2007, Smyth et al 2006 ). A new member of co-inhibitory molecules B - and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) that inhibits lymphocyte activation could influence cancer susceptibility ( Watanabe et al 2003 ). A high expression of BTLA was observed on malignant B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic leukemia ( M\u2019Hidi et al. 2009 ). As BTLA synthesis depends on the rate of gene transcription and/or translation, polymorphism in the corresponding gene might result in abnormal expression and function. The aim of this studywas to evaluate possible associations between selected on the basis of literature ( Fu et al 2009 ) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) existing within exons and introns of BTLA gene: rs9288952A>G, rs1844089G>A, rs2705535C>T and 9288953C>T and susceptibility to B-CLL. Genotyping was done using allelic discrimination method with the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays in 300 B-CLL patients (pts.) (203 pts. from Department of Hematology, Medical University Lodz, Poland and 97 from Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Poland (138 female/162 male) and in 417 healthy individuals (168 female/243 male) originating from the same region of Poland. The significant differences in distribution of alleles and genotypes was observed for intronic SNP -rs9288953. The frequency of T allele and T alleles carriers (CT+TT genotypes) were higher in patients than in healthy controls as compare to C allele and CC genotypes (0.458 vs. 0.375, p=0.0016; OR:1.41, 95%CI - 1.13-1.75 and 0.677 vs. 0.606, p=0.0022; OR:1.67, 95%CI- 1.16-1.2.40, respectively). None of other investigated SNPs have shown different frequency of alleles or genotypes in group of patients and controls. The haplotype analysis of rs9288952A>G, rs1844089G>A, rs2705535C>T and 9288953C>T showed that the most common haplotypes rs9288952A>G[A]/rs1844089G>A[G]/rs2705535C>T[C]/ 9288953C>T[C] (named as AGCC) and rs9288952A>G[A]/rs1844089G>A[G]/rs2705535C>T[C]/ 9288953C>T[T] (named as AGCT) which were differentiate only by variants of 9288953C>T SNP were completely contrary associated with disease susceptibility. Haplotype AGCC is associated with decreased risk of B-CLL (OR: 0.72, 95%CI-0.59-0.90 p with Bonferroni correction =0.01), while AGCT with increased risk of disease (OR: 1.42, 95%CI-1.14-1.76 p with Bonferroni correction =0.005) Our data indicated for the first time the possible role of intronic polymorphism 9288953C>T in gene encoding suppressor molecule BTLA in susceptibility to B-CLL.
