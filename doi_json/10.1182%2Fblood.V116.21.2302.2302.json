    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2302 Although allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from a matched related donor (RD-PBSCT) presents the best curable opportunity for many patients with hematologic malignancies, only about one third of individuals have HLA matched sibling donors. Fortunately, from unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation has been acceptable and expanded recently. In order to evaluate the effect of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from unrelated donor (URD-PBSCT), we compare results of URD-PBSCT and RD-PBSCT that were done for 172 consecutive adult patients with hematologic maligancies from Jan 2002 to Dec 2008 at a single-center. Among these patients, 62 cases underwent URD-PBSCT and 110 cases underwent RD-PBSCT. Myeloablative conditioning was adopted for all patients. In graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, 49 URD-PBSCT recipients received CSA, MTX, MMF and ATG (URD-ATG group), 13 recipients were given simulect more in base of URD-ATG group (URD-ATG+CD25 group) while RD-PBSCT recipients (RD group) received CSA, MTX and MMF. Engraftment was achieved in 98.4% of URD-PBSCT patients and 98.2% of RD-PBSCT patients (100% for patients surviving beyond 28 days after transplant). The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD (grade II-IV) was 15.4%, 36.7% and 29.1% respectively in the URD-ATG+CD25, URD-ATG and RD groups (P = 0.275). The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 0%, 45.6%, 39.6% respectively and significant lower in URD-ATG+CD25 group than the other two groups (P = 0.0134). Relapse incidence was 53.8%, 12.2%, 14.5% respectively and significant higher in URD-ATG+CD25 group than the other s (P = 0.0059), while there was no different between the URD-ATG and RD groups (P = 0.610). Estimated overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 30.8%, 69.4% and 67.3% respectively and no significant difference between URD-ATG group and RD group (p=0.898). Adverse prognosis factors for relapse and OS included transplant not in remission and GVHD prophylaxis with simulect. Our results indicate PBSCT from unrelated donor may be considered comparable to those from related donor. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
