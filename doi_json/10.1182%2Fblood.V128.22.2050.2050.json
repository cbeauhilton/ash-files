    "abstract_text": "The oncogenic Wnt pathway is aberrantly activated in most CLL clones, and hence is an attractive target for therapy. The casein kinase 2 (CK2) enzyme is an established positive regulator of Wnt signaling. The inhibitor Silmitasertib, also known as CX-4945, is a nanomolar inhibitor of CK2. It has been reported that CK2 is overexpressed in CLL. Here we have investigated the effects of CX-4945 on WNT signaling in primary CLL cells. We confirmed that CX-4945 displayed in vitro cytotoxic activity toward CLL cells at very low \u00b5M concentration, as previously reported by others. However, at least 2-3 fold higher concentration of CX-4945 was required to achieve a similar toxicity against normal PBMC. Previously, our laboratory has successfully utilized a short-term CLL \"parking\" model in immunodeficient RAG/gamma chain knock out (RG-KO) mice to evaluate the in vivo efficacy and potential toxicity of anti-CLL agents. CX-4945 at dosages of 0.3-10 mg/kg was administered by oral gavage daily for 6 days to mice injected i.p. with 10 million CLL cells. These dosages of drug were well tolerated, and potently inhibited CLL persistence in the xenotransplanted mice. In a reporter gene assay, CX-4945 dose-dependently inhibited Wnt target gene expression. Furthermore, inhibition of dishevelled-2 (Dvl-2) protein expression was observed in primary CLL patient samples treated with 3-10 \u00b5M CX-4945 for 4-16 hours. Similar reduction in p-GSK3b(S9) protein was also observed. Quantitative RT-PCR also confirmed down regulation of b-catenin gene expression in primary CLL patient samples treated with 10 \u00b5M CX-4945 for 4h. Further molecular analyses of predictive or correlative biomarkers is ongoing using Nanostring PanCancer multipathway gene analysis. In a preliminary study, we found that CX-4945 perturbed the expression of multiple genes implicated in CLL development and survival. In summary, the CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 inhibited Wnt signaling and CLL survival, and displayed oral activity in mice. CK2 inhibitors are thus potential therapeutic agents for CLL.
