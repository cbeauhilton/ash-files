    "abstract_text": "Dendritic cells (DC), the professional antigen presenting cells of the immune system, exert important functions both in induction of T cell immunity as well as of tolerance. Previously, it was accepted that the main function of immature DC (iDC) in their in vivo steady state condition is to maintain peripheral tolerance to self-antigens and that these iDC mature upon encounter of so-called danger signals and subsequently promote T cell immunity. However, a growing body of experimental evidence now indicates that traditional DC maturation can no longer be used to distinguish between tolerogenic and immunogenic properties of DC. In this study, we compared the in vitro stimulatory capacity of immature DC (iDC), cytokine cocktail-matured DC (CC-mDC) and poly I:C-matured DC (pIC-mDC) in the absence and presence of antigen. All investigated DC types could induce at least 2 subsets of regulatory T cells. We observed a significant increase in both the number of functionally suppressive transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta+ interleukin (IL)-10+ T cells as well as of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells within DC/T cell co-cultures as compared to T cell cultures without DC. The induction of these regulatory T cells correlates with in vitro T cell non-responsiveness after co-culture with iDC and CC-mDC, while stimulation with pIC-mDC resulted in reproducible cytomegalovirus pp65 or influenza M1 matrix peptide-specific T cell activation as compared to control cultures in the absence of DC. In addition, the T cell non-responsiveness after stimulation with iDC was shown to be mediated by TGF-beta and IL-10. Moreover, the suppressive capacity of CD4+ T cells activated by iDC and CC-mDC was shown to be transferable when these CD4+ T cells were added to an established T cell response. In contrast, addition of CD4+ T cells stimulated by pIC-mDC made responder T cells refractory to their suppressive activity. In conclusion, we hypothesize that DC have a complementary role in inducing both regulatory T cells and effector T cells, where the final result of antigen-specific T cell activation will depend on the activation state of the DC. This emphasizes the need for proper DC activation when T cell immunity is the desired effect, especially when used in clinical trials.",
