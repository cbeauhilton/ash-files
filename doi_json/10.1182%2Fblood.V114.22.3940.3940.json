    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3940 Poster Board III-876 Introduction Differentiation of nai\u0308ve B cells into plasma cells or memory cells occurs in the germinal centres (GC) of lymph follicles or alternatively in the marginal zone via a GC- and T cell independent pathway. It is currently assumed that B cell lymphomas correspond to normal B cell differentiation stages, but the precise correlation of several B cell lymphomas to these two pathways remains controversial. We have previously shown that junctional adhesion molecule C (JAM-C) originally identified at the cell-cell border of endothelial cells, constitutes also a marker of B lymphocytes with a tightly regulated expression during B cell differentiation: immature B cells, GC-B cells and plasma cells stain negatively, whereas mature, memory and marginal zone derived B cells stain strongly positive. Here we test the expression of JAM-C on a series of patients with B cell lymphomas. Methods B lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of 158 untreated patients were analyzed using flow cytometry with standard antibody panels (CD5, CD10, CD11c, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD38, CD103, FMC7, sIg). Diagnosis of a B cell lymphoma was established according to WHO guidelines, using additionally RT-PCR, karyotyping, or FISH, if necessary. Expression of JAM-C was studied by flow cytometry with a polyclonal antibody obtained from a rabbit immunized with the soluble JAM-C molecule. Results  ALL CASES: 158 . JAM-C pos . % . CLL 7/42 cases 17 MCL 12/18 cases 67 HCL 4/6 cases 67 FL 1/8 cases 13 DLBCL (+ Burkitt lymphoma) 3/15 cases 20 MM 1/7 cases 14 B-ALL 0/5 cases 0 MZBL 24/31 cases 77 LPL 4/13 cases 31 plasmablastic lymphoma 1/1 case 100 ALL CASES: 158 . JAM-C pos . % . CLL 7/42 cases 17 MCL 12/18 cases 67 HCL 4/6 cases 67 FL 1/8 cases 13 DLBCL (+ Burkitt lymphoma) 3/15 cases 20 MM 1/7 cases 14 B-ALL 0/5 cases 0 MZBL 24/31 cases 77 LPL 4/13 cases 31 plasmablastic lymphoma 1/1 case 100 View Large MCL, HCL and MZBL with a supposed origin in the marginal zone stained mostly positive, whereas CLL and FL with a supposed origin in the germinal centre showed mostly a negative staining. No correlation was found in CLL between JAM-C expression and staining for ZAP70 or CD38. In 12 cases routine work-up was not able to precisely establish a diagnosis of CLL or MZBL, and CLL or MCL. In these cases the presence of JAM-C was considered a strong argument against a GC-origin of the malignant B cells. Addition of JAM-C to antibodies used in the Matutes score increased the sensitivity and specificity of this score for the diagnosis of CLL. Furthermore, it may help differentiating MZBL from LPL which otherwise display overlapping immunophenotypes. Conclusion JAM-C constitutes a new diagnostic marker for the differential diagnosis of B cell lymphomas, and is particularly useful for the distinction between CLL and LPL (negative staining) on the one hand and mantle cell and marginal zone B cell lymphomas (positive staining) on the other hand.
