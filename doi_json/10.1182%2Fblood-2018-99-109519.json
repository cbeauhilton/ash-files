    "abstract_text": "Iron is an essential nutrient required by every cell in the human body, yet it can also be a potent cellular toxin. Iron is essential because enzymes that require iron co-factors (namely, heme, iron-sulfur clusters, mono- and dinuclear iron centers) are involved in virtually every major metabolic process in the cell. Iron deficiency continues to be the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, while iron overload is a feature of an increasing number of human diseases, including genetic disorders such as hereditary hemochromatosis, thalassemias, and Friedreich ataxia, as well as chronic inflammatory diseases of the liver, such as hepatitis C and steatohepatitis. The biochemical mechanisms by which iron causes toxicity are not completely known. Previously, we identified Poly rC-binding protein 1 (Pcbp1) as a protein that directly binds and delivers iron to ferritin, the major iron storage protein in mammalian cells. Pcbp1 and its paralog Pcbp2 are multifunctional adaptors that bind cellular RNA, DNA, proteins, and iron, altering the fate of their binding partners. Ferritin is a large polypeptide, containing 24 subunits of H- and L-chains assembled into a hollow sphere. Reduced (ferrous) iron enters the sphere through pores formed between the subunits and is oxidized on the interior surface to form nanocrystals of ferric oxyhydroxides. Pcbp1 is the first example of an iron chaperone- a protein that specifically binds iron ions and delivers them to target proteins, such as ferritin, through direct protein-protein interactions. In cultured cells, Pcbp1 is also required for efficient iron delivery to non-heme enzymes in addition to ferritin. These enzymes include the mononuclear iron-containing prolyl hydroxylases that regulate HIF and the dinuclear iron-containing deoxyhypusine hydroxylase, which is required for the modification of lysine to hypusine. In the adult human, 70% of total body iron is present in circulating erythrocytes, which are produced by the bone marrow at a rate of 2 million reticulocytes per second. We examined the roles of Pcbp1 and Ncoa4 in this extraordinary flux of iron through the erythron. Ncoa4 is the cargo receptor that recruits ferritin into the autophagosome for degradation in the lysosome. Using an in vitro model of erythroid differentiation, we showed that depletion of Pcbp1 or Ncoa4 impeded trafficking of iron through ferritin, which impaired the synthesis of heme and hemoglobin. Mice with tamoxifen-induced Pcbp1 deficiency exhibited a microcytic anemia typical of iron deficiency, with activation of compensatory erythropoiesis. The role of ferritin in erythropoiesis has been controversial, but our studies indicate that iron flux through ferritin is an obligatory process in the early stages of erythroid terminal differentiation. Our in vitro studies of erythrocytes revealed that the interactions of Pcbp1 and Ncoa4 with ferritin changed during differentiation, with maximal binding of Pcbp1 at early stages and Ncoa4 at late stages. These binding activities are regulated by cellular iron in mechanistically distinct ways. Ongoing studies of Pcbp1 deficiency in other murine tissues suggest the importance of iron chaperones in maintaining the bioavailable pool of iron in mammalian cells.
