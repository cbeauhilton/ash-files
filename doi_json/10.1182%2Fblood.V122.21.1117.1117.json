    "abstract_text": "Background Stevens Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN) are specific drug hypersensitivity reactions initiated by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Augmentation of T-cell activation by positive co-stimulation and Major Histocompatibility Complex-restricted presentation of the culprit drug triggers T-cell activation following interaction with T-cell receptors. This T-cell activation results in expression of cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, granzyme B and granulysin from NK cells. Besides their role in causing SJS/TEN, these cytokines cause coagulation activation. Materials & Methods Following an Institutional Review Board approved protocol blood samples were obtained from subjects suspected of SJS/TEN and normal healthy volunteers (n=2). Confirmatory biopsies were performed in all SJS/TEN subjects which confirmed SJS/TEN in 4 subjects and were negative in 7 subjects. Cytokine levels were measured using the cerebral II array biochip from Randox Laboratories Limited (Crumlin, UK). Besides cerebral array II, other parameters such as thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes (Dade\u00ae, Marburg, Germany), fibrinopeptide A (F1.2, Dade\u00ae), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1, Diagnostica Stago\u00ae and STACHROME antithrombin (Stago\u00ae), ZYMUPHEN platelet microparticles activity (Hyphen\u00ae Biomed (Neuville-sur-Oise, France), and HEMOCLOT protein C (Stago\u00ae) were measured using ELISA kits as per manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Results Compared to the Normal Human Plasma, the IL-4, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and MCP-1 levels were increased significantly in biopsy-confirmed SJS/TEN patients (see table ). Other parameters measured including IL-2, IL-8, IL-10, VEGF, INF-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b1, IL1-\u03b2 and EGF were not significantly increased. A marked increase in the TAT complexes (6.3\u00b15.9 \u00b5g/ml), F1.2 (430.4\u00b1202.4 pmol/L), platelet microparticles (13.1\u00b19.3 nM) and protein C levels (90.5\u00b163.4%) with a corresponding decrease in PAI-1 (53.3\u00b118.8ng/ml) and antithrombin levels (80.7\u00b142.4%) compared to normal human plasma were also observed. Biopsy-negative SJS/TEN subjects with less pronounced inflammatory stimulus, demonstrated mild elevation in cytokine levels of IL-4 (1.95\u00b10.59 pg/ml), IL-6 (29.81\u00b125.18 pg/ml), TNF-\u03b1 (7.20\u00b15.04 pg/ml) and MCP-1 (265.10\u00b1159.09 pg/ml)).

These alterations in coagulation may progress to sepsis associated coagulopathy and overt disseminated intravascular coagulation. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
