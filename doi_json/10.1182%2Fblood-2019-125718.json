    "abstract_text": "Introduction Follicular Lymphoma (FL), the second most frequent lymphoma in adults, often presents as a disseminated disease at diagnosis. Despite a generally slow progression and a median overall survival of more than 15 years with current chemo-immunotherapies, FL patients often suffer from multiple relapses. Yet, the biological mechanisms promoting FL dissemination, progression and relapse are still poorly understood. FL, like most B-cell lymphomas, originates from germinal centers (GC) where B-cells physiologically undergo clonal expansion, antibody affinity maturation, and differentiation into antibody-producing plasma cells (PC) or recirculating memory (Mem) B-cells. Recently, we provided evidence that FL B-cells are not blocked in a GC B-cell state but might adopt new dynamic modes of functional diversity ( Milpied et al., Nature Immunology 2018) , yet the main sources of intratumoral heterogeneity within FL remained to be identified. Methods Frozen live cell suspensions were obtained from the CeVi collection of the Institute Carnot/Calym (ANR, France). We initially applied a plate-based 5'-end single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) method for deep integrative single-cell analyses of transcriptome, B-cell receptor (BCR) sequence, and surface phenotype on FACS-sorted FL B-cells (4 patients, lymph node biopsies) and their non-malignant counterparts (6 adult healthy donors, spleen and tonsil samples). We confirmed our findings on additional FL samples with high-throughput droplet-based 3'-end scRNAseq (9 patients, lymph node biopsies), and 5'-end scRNAseq paired with BCRseq (5 patients, lymph node biopsies). Custom and existing bioinformatics analysis pipelines were combined for quality control and cell filtering, dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP), clustering, pseudo-time analysis, BCR sequence analysis and integrative data analysis. We further validated our transcriptomic data with FACS-based surface and intracellular protein analysis (8 patients, lymph node biopsies). Results Consistent with our previous findings, FL B-cells were transcriptionally diverse, with most cells exhibiting a patient-specific gene expression profile distinct from PC, GC and Mem cells. Challenging the mainstream view of a differentiation blockade in FL, we identified rare FL B-cells carrying a PC-like profile (including low expression of MS4A1 /CD20, high expression of XBP1 , MZB1 , PRDM1 ). PC-like FL B-cells expressed high levels of the tumor clonal BCR heavy and light chain mRNA, and BCR sequence phylogenetic analysis revealed that those cells did not branch out from a specific tumor subclone. Most importantly, we found that the molecular profiles of the vast majority of FL B-cells spanned a continuum of transitional states between proliferating GC-like and quiescent Mem-like gene expression states. Principal component analysis and pseudo-time reconstruction revealed that pseudo-immune differentiation axis was consistently the main source of intra-sample transcriptional heterogeneity. On top of cell cycle related genes, GC-like FL B-cells notably expressed AICDA , BCL6 , RGS13 , NANS , CD81 , and CD38 genes. By contrast, Mem-like FL B-cells expressed CD44 , GPR183 , CD69 , CXCR4 , CCR7 , SELL , KLF2 , suggesting that those cells may not be confined to the FL follicles. Flow cytometry analysis of dissociated FL tumors confirmed that only the CD38 hi CD81 hi subset of FL B-cells (GC-like cells), expressed Ki67 and high levels of Bcl6, whereas only CD38 neg CD81 neg FL B-cells (Mem-like cells) consistently contained CD44 + and GPR183 + cells. Conclusions Our study suggests that FL B-cells hijack the physiological GC differentiation process to dynamically alternate between GC-like and Mem-like states that might be responsible for FL progression and dissemination, respectively. We anticipate that such FL-specific clonal dynamics may be orchestrated by extrinsic signals delivered by tumor-infiltrating T cells.
