    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3570 Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a small B cell lymphoma, incurable with standard chemo-immunotherapy. The best initial treatment regimen remains unclear. Although it is generally acknowledged that aggressive approaches using combination chemotherapy and/or high dose chemotherapy can prolong survival, consensus on upfront treatment strategies for advanced MCL is currently lacking without randomized controlled data to guide treatment decisions. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis to describe and compare the survival experiences of MCL patients at the University of Pennsylvania treated in the first-line setting with R-HCVAD (N=43) with or without autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or Rituximab maintenance. The primary study endpoints were PFS and OS as assessed by chart review and confirmed by SSDI database. Median follow up for all pts was 3 years. The median age was 53.7, and 76.7 % (n=33) were stage IV at diagnosis. 15 patients underwent consolidative ASCT. 11 pts received Rituximab maintenance. Comparing patients treated with R-HCVAD vs R-HCVAD + R maintenance vs. R-HCVAD + ASCT, there were no statistical differences in terms of age, ECOG PS, LDH, WBC, beta-2microglobulin, BM or GI involvement, bulky disease or blastoid variant at baseline. Median PFS for all patients was 3.9 years: R-HCVAD alone 2.1 years vs. R-HCVAD+R 3.9 years (P=0.02, HR 3.51, 95%CI: 1.2\u201310.2) vs R-HCVAD + SCT not reached (p=0.017, HR 3.7, 95%CI: 1.26\u201310.63). PFS survival rates at 2 years were 50%, 88% and 70%; 33%, 71/% and 63% respectively at 3 years, and 0%, 33% and 33 % at 5 years. 3 year OS for all patients was 84% (95% CI: 65\u201394) with no significant differences among the three approaches. Notably, only 1/8 patients treated with R-HCVAD + SCT relapsed after 2 years, with a median follow up of 4.8 years for these patients. Our data suggest a further improved PFS when R-HCVAD is consolidated with either Rituximab maintenance or ASCT. While neither of the two consolidative approaches appears superior in our limited data set, both show significant PFS prolongation when compared to R-HCVAD alone. Further prospective investigation of consolidative approaches after RHCVAD in a randomized fashion is warranted.
