    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1555 Background: Tumor-infiltrating immune cells perform important functions in host immune reaction against tumor cells including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Recently, variable tumor-infiltrating cells were reported to give a influence for prognosis, for example, regulatory T cell (T reg), cytotoxic T cell, macrophage and mast cell etc. Among these microenvironmental cells, we focused on Treg cell, and we assessed the distribution and prognostic significance of these cells in DLBCL. The forkhead/winged helix transcription factor 3 (FOXP3) is a transcriptional factorshown to be the key control gene in the development and function of Tregs both in mice and humans. Patients and Methods: We examined samples from 94 patients (54 men and 40 women; median age, 70 years) at diagnosis who were prospectively enrolled between 2002 and 2008. All patients treated with R-CHOP(rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone). The pattern of FOXP3 protein expression was evaluated using immunehistochemistry in paraffin-embeded tissue samples. In addition, these samples were stained with antibodies for CD10, bcl-6 and MUM-1 via tissue microarray to classify into subgroups. Results: The median percentage of FOXP3+ cells was 91/mm2 (range 4\u20132100 /mm2). Patients with poor performance status (PS), and high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) showed lower numbers of FOXP3+ cells. (PS; p= 0.014, LDH; p=0.0048) Patients with high counts of FOXP3+ cells (>90/mm2) have better prognosis than those of low counts (5 year (5-y) overall survival (OS); 72.1%, 49.7% p=0.024, respectively). Although no prognostic difference was observed between GCB type and non-GCB type (5-y OS: GCB 71.2%, non GCB 53.1%, p=0.12), low counts of FOXP3+ cell and non-GCB type patient was poorer prognosis than high counts and non GCB type. (low 5-y OS 31.2%, high 5-y OS 69.8% p=0.02). Conclusion: Increased count of FOXP3+ tumor-infiltrating cell might predict better prognosis of DLBCL.
