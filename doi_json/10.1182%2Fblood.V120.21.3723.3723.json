    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3723 Background: Waldenstro\u0308m macroglobulinemia (WM), a lymphoproliferative disorder with marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma cells and production of monoclonal IgM, is characterized clinically by good initial responses to standard therapeutic approaches. However, a minority of patients achieve a complete remission, and most inevitably relapse, indicating a need for validation of new, targeted therapies. Notably, B-cell receptor signaling has been linked to clonal evolution in WM, and Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is over-expressed in primary patient cells. Also, a recent phase I/II study of the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib in patients with a variety of non-Hodgkin lymphomas showed evidence of activity in three patients with WM. These findings supported our central hypothesis, which proposed that Syk could be a rational new target for therapy of WM, which we pursued first with pre-clinical studies. Methods: Studies of fostamatinib were performed using the WM cell line MWCL-1, and the IgM-producing cell line BWCM.1, as well as in primary cells from patients with WM, and in a novel murine xenograft model utilizing MWCL-1 cells. Results: Fostamatinib induced a time- and dose-dependent reduction in viability of MWCL-1 and BWCM.1 cells, with median inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) that were in the physiologically relevant range of approximately 0.25 and 1 \u03bcM, respectively, at 3 days. Cell cycle analysis showed a decrease in cells at S-phase and at G 2 /M, while an increase was seen in cells in G 1 , and in the sub-G 1 fraction, suggesting induction of apoptosis. Consistent with the possibility that there was activation of type I programmed cell death, increased staining was seen in fostamatinb-treated cells with an antibody to Annexin V. Interestingly, evidence was seen of the induction of type II programmed cell death, or autophagy, as measured by an increase in cells staining with the lysotropic dye acridine orange. At the molecular level, fostamatinib blocked signaling through p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), MAPK kinase (MEK), protein kinase B/Akt, and Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase (ZAP)-70/Syk, as judged by a reduction in the phosphorylated forms of these intermediates by Western blotting. Notably, the viability of primary cells isolated from patients with WM was also reduced in association with blockade of p44/42 MAPK. Finally, a novel murine xenograft model was generated by injection of MWCL-1 cells into immunodeficient mice, which developed measurable tumors. When these were treated with fostamatinib, a delay in tumor growth was demonstrable. Conclusions: Targeting Syk with fostamatinib is an attractive strategy against pre-clinical models of WM both in vitro and in vivo . These findings lend further support for translation of fostamatinib to the clinic for patients with relapsed, and possibly even newly diagnosed WM.
