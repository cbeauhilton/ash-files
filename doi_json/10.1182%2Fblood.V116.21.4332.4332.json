    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4332 Here we reported one case of atypical T cell prolymphocytic leukemia. The 38-year female was admitted to our hospital for fatigue and night sweat. She complained of fatigue and night sweat for one month and accompanied by gum bleeding. Physical examination showed anemia and massive spleen extending to umbilical level. Blood routine test indicated pancytopenia (detailed info: Wbc 0.66\u00d710 9 /L,Hb 82g/L,Plt 60\u00d710 9 /L)and elevated proportion of lymphocytes. Blood biochemistry and routine serum tumor marker were normal. Mutation of JAK2V617F was negative. Marrow film showed many atypical mature lymphocytes which expressed mature T cell markers. Marrow biopsy showed a SLL-like scene and accompanied by local fibrosis, immunochemical stains strong CD3, CD45-R0, CD43 and weak CD5, MPO. Repeated TCR \u03b2 rearrangement indicated positive. PET/CT scan could not find specific elevated SUV lesions. This patient may be diagnosed as atypical T cell prolymphocytic leukemia despite her lymphocytopenia and unpalpable peripheral lymph nodes. She received one cycle of CVP (cyclophosphamide, Vincristine and prednisone) and another cycle of CHOP(cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, Vincristine and prednisone). Her blood cell count partly recovered and she was preparing for following high dose chemotherapy. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
