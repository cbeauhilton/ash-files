    "abstract_text": "Introduction. Favorable therapeutic regimen for pregnant women with primary mediastinal B-cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) is determined by tumor mass, somatic status, period of pregnancy and potential risk of teratogenic effects of medications which penetrate through placenta. Aim. To estimate chemotherapy efficacy of PMBCL in case of pregnancy and its toxicity for fetus. Patients and Methods. Since 2004 to 2015 years in National Research Center for Hematology were treated 106 patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. In 8 (7,5%) from them disease debuted during 2-3 trimester of pregnancy, one women had two fetuses simultaneously. Before delivery women underwent induction chemotherapy with VACOPB- regimen in 5/8 cases and with R+DAEPOCH in 3/8 cases. Results. After induction treatment had been performed 6/8 women achieved a partial remission, 1/8 had progression, 1/8 - complete remission. High dose chemotherapy was performed in 7/8 women after 1 month following delivery. It was born 9 children (4 boys and 5 girls). Median body weight was 2000 g. (1300 - 3600 g.). Median growth was 47 cm. (40 - 53 cm). In two cases when rituximab had been administered to women before delivery, children were diagnosed with intrauterine pneumonia. One child, born from woman after VACOPB chemotherapy had thrombosis of superior vena cava. All women continue to be in complete remission of PMBCL, children are practically healthy without malformations. The median follow-up of patients was 40 months (15 - 78 months). Conclusions. Pregnancy is not a contradiction for induction chemotherapy of PMBCL in 2-3 trimesters. Rituximab shouldn't be administered before delivery because of a high risk of infectious in fetus. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
