    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3255 Introduction: Microvascular abnormalities underlie much of the morbidity observed in sickle cell disease (SCD). Adherence of sickle erythrocytes and leukocytes to the microvascular endothelium leads to vaso-occlusion and end organ ischemia/reperfusion injury. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) is a chemokine involved in the recruitment of monocytes to sites of endothelial activation or injury and thus contributes to the pathophysiology of vascular disease. In SCD patients, circulating MCP-1 concentrations are elevated during both steady state and vaso-occlusive crisis. However, the relationship between MCP-1 and microvascular abnormalities in SCD patients has not been assessed. In the present study, we measured a panel of circulating cytokines including serum MCP-1 and hematological biomarkers including serum ferritin in SCD patients who were being monitored by computer-assisted intravital microscopy (CAIM) to assess severity of microvasculopathy. Methods: The study included 31 steady state SCD patients (22 females, 9 males) ranging in age from 4\u201361 years. MCP-1 concentrations were measured by Luminex multiple analyte profiling. Ferritin concentrations were measured by chemiluminometric immunossay. The conjunctival microvasculature was assessed using CAIM. A severity index on a scale of 0\u201315 was calculated as described previously (Cheung et al, Am J Hematol 85:899, 2010) to quantify the degree of microvasculopathy observed among the patients. Results: The mean \u00b1 SD MCP-1 concentration was 445 \u00b1 253 pg/ml (range: 122\u20131180 pg/ml), mean \u00b1 SD ferritin concentration was 1675 \u00b1 1883 ng/ml (range 18\u20135825 ng/ml), and mean \u00b1 SD severity index was 5.0 \u00b1 2.5 (range: 0\u20139). By multiple regression analysis, with controlling for age and gender, MCP-1 was directly correlated with severity index (p = 0.046), and serum ferritin was directly correlated with MCP-1 (p = 0.019). Conclusions: Monocyte recruitment to the site of endothelial injury involves chemotactic signaling mediated in part by MCP-1, levels of which rise in SCD. Our results indicate that MCP-1 is associated with and may directly contribute to the microvasculopathy observed in SCD patients. Furthermore, we find that MCP-1 levels are correlated with ferritin concentrations. Ferritin reflects body iron stores, and an increase of iron stores in SCD resulting from chronic blood transfusion as well as increased iron absorption associated with hemolysis may thus lead to monocyte/macrophage recruitment to the vascular endothelium and contribute to vasculopathy. Measurements of MCP-1 and ferritin may also serve as surrogate biomarkers of microvasculopathy severity and inflammation.
