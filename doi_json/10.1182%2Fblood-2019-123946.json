    "abstract_text": "Background: Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1 ) occur in ~3% of individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and have been associated with increased transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ivosidenib (AG-120) is an oral, potent, targeted inhibitor of the mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 enzyme (mIDH1) and is approved in the US for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation in patients \u226575 years of age or who have comorbidities that preclude the use of intensive induction chemotherapy, and in adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML. The first-in-human, phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study of ivosidenib (NCT02074839) enrolled adults with m IDH1 advanced hematologic malignancies, including R/R MDS, and the study is ongoing. In the initial phase of the study (DiNardo et al. N Engl J Med 2018), the 12 patients with R/R MDS received 500 mg ivosidenib once daily and were characterized as follows: 75% were male, median age was 72.5 years (range 52-78), and 42% were \u226575 years of age; median number of prior therapies was 1 (range 1-3). Adverse events (AEs) of any grade, irrespective of causality, occurring in \u226520% of the 12 patients were diarrhea, fatigue, back pain, rash (n=4 each, 33.3%), anemia, urinary tract infection, decreased appetite, hypokalemia, arthralgia, dyspnea, pruritus, and hypotension (n=3 each, 25.0%). No AEs led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. Response was assessed according to International Working Group 2006 criteria for MDS. According to investigators, five of 12 patients achieved complete remission (CR) (41.7%; 95% CI 15.2%, 72.3%); median duration of CR was not estimable for these patients (95% CI 2.8 months, not estimable). Nine of 12 patients were transfusion independent for at least 56 days during study treatment. Mutation clearance was observed in one of the 5 CR patients. Here we report the design of a new sub-study of this trial, which is being undertaken to further assess the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of treatment with ivosidenib in patients with R/R MDS. Methods: This sub-study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of ivosidenib. Adults with R/R MDS with an IDH1 mutation will be enrolled in the MDS sub-study. These individuals must have R/R disease after treatment with standard agents indicated for MDS. Eligible patients must have a platelet count of \u226520,000/\u03bcL, and adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin \u22641.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal [ULN]; aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase \u22643.0 \u00d7 ULN) and renal function (serum creatinine \u22642.0 \u00d7 ULN or creatinine clearance >40 mL/min). Additional key inclusion criteria are bone marrow blasts >5% and/or transfusion dependence. Ivosidenib is to be administered at a dose of 500 mg once daily orally on Days 1 to 28 of 28-day cycles. The addition of the MDS sub-study to this phase 1 clinical study in patients with hematological malignancies will provide additional insights into the use of ivosidenib for the treatment of m IDH1 R/R MDS.
