    "abstract_text": "Backgrounds: More than half of the patients with newly diagnosed aggressive lymphomas are older than 60 years. The addition of rituximab to the conventional CHOP regimen, administered every 21 days, has conclusively demonstrated to lead to a significant improvement of the outcome in elderly patients with DLBCL and surivival benefit. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of dose attenuated CHOP with rituximab 3 weekly in untreated elderly DLBCL. Methods: CHOP regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide(600mg/m 2 ), doxorubicin(30mg/m 2 ), vincristine (1mg/m 2 ) on day 1, and prednisolone (20mg bid) given on day 1 to 5 every 3 weeks. Rituximab (375mg/m 2 ) was administered the same day as CHOP. Results: This study included 37 patients with DLBCL with a median age of 70 years (range:64\u201381). Seventy six percent had an international prognostic index score>1, 35% had stage IV disease. Toxicity was calculated over 192 cycles administered. Grade 4 neutropenia developed in 2.6% of cycles and no grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity didn\u2019t developed except asthenia (1 person). The overall response rate was 83.3% (complete response rate: 72.2%). 2 year overall and event free survival rates were 79.8% and 67%, respectively. Conclusions: Dose attenuated R-CHOP is effective and tolerable for elderly patients with DLBCL."
