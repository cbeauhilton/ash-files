    "abstract_text": "Background: BT062 (Biotest AG, Dreieich, Germany) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprising a CD138-binding chimerized antibody and the cytotoxic maytansinoid, DM4. It is designed to target and kill CD138-positive cancer cells. CD138 (Syndecan-1) is highly expressed on a number of solid tumors and hematological malignancies and is one of the most reliable markers for multiple myeloma (MM) cells. BT062 was previously evaluated as a monotherapy in patients with heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory MM and found to have an acceptable tolerability profile with preliminary evidence of activity (Heffner et al , Blood. 2012; 120: Abstract 4042). Phase I/IIa testing was initiated with BT062 in combination with lenalidomide (Len) and low-dose dexamethasone (dex). The combination was well tolerated at BT062 doses up to 100 mg/m\u00b2, defined to be the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD), and induced meaningful responses, including in patients previously treated with both Len and bortezomib (Bort) (Kelly et al , Blood. 2014; 124: Abstract 4736). Based on these promising results, further investigation of BT062 in combination with pomalidomide (Pom) and dex was initiated in patients with prior Len and Bort exposure, a patient population known to have a poor outcome. Objectives: To evaluate the safety and activity of BT062 (on days 1, 8, and 15 in a 4-week cycle) used in combination with dex (20-40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22) and Len (25 mg, daily on days 1-21) or Pom (4 mg, daily on days 1-21) in patients with relapsed/refractory MM. Methods: This is a prospective, open label, multicenter Phase I/IIa study. The RPTD of BT062 in combination with Len/dex was defined to be 100 mg/m\u00b2, and 38 patients were treated with BT062/Len/dex at the BT062 RPTD. An additional 17 patients were treated with BT062/Pom/dex at the BT062 RPTD. Patients aged \u226518 years with relapsed/refractory MM were eligible to participate. Prior treatment with Len, Pom, and/or dexamethasone (any dose) was allowed. To qualify for treatment with BT062/Len/dex at the BT062 RPTD, patients must have received at least one but no more than six prior therapies.To qualify for treatment with BT062/Pom/dex, patients must have received at least two prior therapies, including both Len and Bort, and progressed on or within 60 days of completion of their last therapy, with no limit on number of prior therapies. Patients with clinical response (or no evidence of disease progression) without unacceptable toxicities were eligible to receive additional treatment cycles. Toxicities were assessed by CTCAE v4. Clinical response was assessed by the investigator according to International Myeloma Working Group criteria. Results: Sixty-four patients have received BT062 in combination with dex and Len or Pom in this ongoing study. The combinations have been generally well tolerated, with approximately 90% of adverse events (AEs) reported CTC grade 1 or 2. The most common AEs reported are diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea. Forty-seven patients have received BT062 with Len/Dex (3 at 80 mg/m\u00b2, 38 at 100 mg/m\u00b2, 6 at 120 mg/m\u00b2), with 8 patients still on treatment. Among these 47 patients, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 16.4 months. Forty-three patients completed at least two treatment cycles and were evaluable for response. Of these patients 33 achieved a partial response (PR) or better, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 77% and a median duration of response (DOR) of 21.0 months. Thirteen of the evaluable BT062/Len/dex-treated patients had prior exposure to both Len and Bort and progressed on or within 60 days of their last therapy. ORR was 54% among these patients, including 1 complete response (CR), 4 very good partial responses (VGPR) and 2 PRs. Seventeen patients were treated with BT062/Pom/dex, all had prior exposure to both Len and Bort and progressed on or within 60 days of their last therapy. ORR was 79%, with 4 VGPR and 7 PR among the 14 patients evaluable for efficacy. Median PFS has not been reached after 7.5 months median follow up, with 7 patients still on treatment. Updated safety and activity data will be presented. Conclusion: BT062 has been found to be well tolerated when used in combination with Len/dex or Pom/dex, with encouraging activity even in patients with Len- and Bort-pretreated disease progressing on or within 60 days of completion of their last therapy.
