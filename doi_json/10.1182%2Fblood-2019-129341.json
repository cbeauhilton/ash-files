    "abstract_text": "Leukemia relapse represents a failure of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) and remains the major limitation of allogeneic stem cell/bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the principal determinant of transplant-related mortality and is initiated by a network of alloantigen presentation by professional and non-professional APC that prime donor T cells in the GI tract and related lymphoid structures. Since GVL and lethal GVHD are mediated by donor T cells at spatially distinct sites; bone marrow (BM) and the GI tract respectively, we sought tractable approaches to spatially separate alloreactive responses at these two locations. The administration of high dose steroids in the peri-transplant period is permissive of T cell replete HLA-haploidentical BMT and significant GVL effects (Ogawa H, et al. BBMT. 2006). We utilized murine haploidentical BMT models (B6D2F1 \u2192 B6C3F1, B6 \u2192 B6D2F1) with recipient background MLL/AF9 primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with or without dexamethasone (Dex) administration (5 mg/kg/day i.p., days -1 to +5). Dex-treatment improved transplant survival (from 25% to 68% at day 100, P=0.0012) with significant reductions in GVHD histopathology specifically in the colon (histopathology scores 8.7\u00b11.0 vs 4.6\u00b10.8, P< 0.05), despite excellent leukemia control. To understand this paradox, we analyzed the kinetics of donor T cell expansion after BMT. In the mesenteric lymph node (mLN), Dex treatment significantly suppressed the expansion of both CD4 and CD8 T cells (3.3\u00b10.3 x 10 5 vs 1.4\u00b10.3 x 10 5 , P< 0.001 and 4.2\u00b10.4 x 10 5 vs 2.1\u00b10.4 x 10 5 , P< 0.01 respectively) and the activation of CD4 T cells (CD25 MFI: 2021\u00b1146 vs 1056\u00b1102, P< 0.01). In contrast, donor effector/memory CD44 + CD8 T cells were expanded in the BM of Dex treated recipients (1.9\u00b10.3 x 10 5 vs 3.1\u00b10.4 x 10 5 , P< 0.05) that demonstrated high per cell cytolytic activity against leukemia (specific lysis: 65\u00b12.4 % vs 62\u00b12.6 % in untreated vs Dex-treated, P> 0.05). Surprisingly, there was no difference in proliferation (cell tracking dye dilution: 63\u00b15.5 % vs 57\u00b15.5 % in untreated vs Dex-treated, P> 0.05) or apoptosis (caspase-3: 6.6\u00b10.4 % vs 6.1\u00b10.6 %, caspase-8: 20\u00b11.6 % vs 17\u00b13.3 % in untreated vs Dex-treated, respectively, P> 0.05) of CD4 T cells in the mLN between the two groups. We undertook experiments with luciferase expressing T cells and noted that Dex-treatment preferentially inhibited T cell accumulation in the GI tract, but not marrow after BMT. Thus, it appeared that Dex treatment preferentially re-distributed donor T cells from the GI tract to the bone marrow. We next determined if Dex exerted effects via direct signaling to the donor T cell. We thus transplanted glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-deficient or intact T cells (GRfl/fl lck-Cre mice). Dex-treatment reduced donor CD4 T cell expansion in the mLN independent of their expression of the GR (untreated vs Dex-treated: 2.8\u00b10.6 x 10 5 vs 1.2\u00b10.3 x 10 5 , lck CRE GR fl/fl and 2.4\u00b10.3 x 10 5 vs 1.4\u00b10.4 x 10 5 , GR fl/fl littermates, P< 0.05 both groups). Thus steroid effects were mediated indirectly, putatively via effects on recipient alloantigen presentation. There was a marked reduction in recipient dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages expressing the Ea peptide within MHC class II in the GI tract of Dex-treated recipients (terminal Ileum YAe + DC number 896\u00b193 vs 356\u00b140, P< 0.01, YAe + macrophage number 1035\u00b1136 vs 355\u00b197, P< 0.01). In conjunction with this, expression of the gut homing integrin a4b7 expression was reduced in CD4 T cells from Dex treated recipient mLN (25\u00b11.6 % vs 17\u00b11.7 %, P< 0.01), while the marrow homing integrin VLA-4 (a4b1) was increased (a4: 62\u00b12.2 % vs 75\u00b11.6 %, P< 0.001, b1: 52\u00b12.5 % vs 61\u00b11.6 %, P< 0.05) in donor CD8 T cells from Dex treated recipient BM. Finally, Dex treatment enhanced GVL against a second primary AML (BCR/ABL-NUP98/HOXA9) relative to untreated recipients and those receiving post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) (relapse rate: 0% vs 40% vs 100% at day 35 in Dex vs untreated vs PT-Cy, PT-Cy vs Dex-treated, P< 0.0001; untreated vs Dex-treated, P=0.029). These data suggest a potential therapeutic strategy to modulate antigen presentation in the GI tract and consequent integrin imprinting that minimizes GVHD lethality whilst enhancing GVL within BM.
