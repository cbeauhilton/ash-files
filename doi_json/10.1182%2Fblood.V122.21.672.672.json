    "abstract_text": "Purpose Although CD49d is an unfavorable prognostic marker in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), definitive validation evidence is lacking. A worldwide multi-center analysis was performed using published and unpublished CLL series to evaluate the impact of CD49d as overall survival (OS) and treatment free survival (TFS) predictor. Patients and Methods A training/validation strategy was chosen to find the optimal CD49d cut-off. The hazard ratio (HR) for death and treatment imposed by CD49d was estimated by pooled analysis of 2,972 CLL, and Cox analysis stratified by center and stage was used to adjust for confounding variables. The importance of CD49d over other flow cytometry-based prognosticators (CD38, ZAP-70) was ranked by recursive partitioning. Results Patients with \u226530% of neoplastic cells expressing CD49d were considered CD49d + . The decrease in OS at 5 and 10-years among CD49d + cases was 7% and 23% (decrease in TFS 26% and 25% respectively). The pooled HR of CD49d for OS was 2.5 (2.3 for TFS) in univariate analysis. This HR remained significant and of similar magnitude (HR=2.0) in a Cox model adjusted for clinical and biological prognosticators. Hierarchical trees including all cases, or restricted to early stage or patients \u226465 years, always selected CD49d as the most important flow-cytometry-based biomarker, with negligible additional prognostic information added by CD38 or ZAP-70. Consistently, by bivariate analysis, CD49d reliably identified patients' subsets with poorer outcome independent of CD38 and ZAP-70. Conclusions In this analysis of \u223c3000 patients, CD49d emerged as the strongest flow cytometry-based predictor of OS and TFS in CLL.
