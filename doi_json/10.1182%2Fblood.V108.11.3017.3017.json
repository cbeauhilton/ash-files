    "abstract_text": "Since September 1998, we prospectively studied the feasibility of transplantation using purified peripheral blood CD34 + cells from HLA-identical sibling donors in first chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). A total of 60 patients (pts) with a median pretransplant risk score of 2 (range 1\u20134) has been included in this study. One patient received an unmanipulated graft due to poor CD34 + donor cell mobilization, while three pts (5%) were successfully retransplanted with an unmanipulated graft from the primary donor after secondary graft failure (n=2) or from an unrelated donor after hematologic relapse (n=1). As part of the study protocol, all pts were closely monitored for BCR-ABL transcripts using real-time RT-PCR analysis of peripheral blood cells as well as BCR-ABL-interphase FISH and metaphase karyotyping of marrow cells. Of the 60 pts, 56 were eligible for the application of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI), but 7 pts did not receive DLI due to sustained molecular remission and complete chimerism. Thirty-one pts (52%) received DLI because of increasing BCR-ABL transcript levels or hematologic relapse, and 18 pts (30%) as programmed T-cell add-back. The median starting dose was 0.33 (0.01 \u2013 10) x 10 6 CD3 + cells per kg with a median maximum dose 3.3 (0.17 \u2013 100) x 10 6 CD3 + cells per kg. DLI induced a lasting reduction of median BCR-ABL transcript levels (BCR-ABL/GAPDH ratio) of more than 3 log10 and the estimate of being in a complete molecular remission at 7 years is 83% \u00b1 5%. Six pts. (10%) did not respond to DLI, but 4 of these pts. attained a cytogenetic and molecular response by imatinib and/or interferon treatment. The cumulative risk of grades II-IV acute GvHD is 15% \u00b1 5% for all study pts, and the risk of chronic GvHD is 25% \u00b1 6%, respectively. After a median follow-up period of 46 (range 6 \u2013 86) months for all pts, the cumulative 7-year survival estimate is 91% \u00b1 4% (survival rate 92%). Causes of death were disease progression, secondary malignancy, liver failure, septicemia, and systemic capillary leak syndrome in one patient each. In conclusion, the concept of highly purified peripheral blood CD34 + cell transplantation in conjunction with adoptive DLI is associated with a particularly low risk of non-relapse mortality and allows induction of lasting molecular disease control in the majority of first chronic phase CML patients.",
