    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4756 Introduction: SONAR, the only state-funded (South Carolina) pharmacovigilance initiative in the nation, focuses on identifying near fatal side effects of hematology and oncology therapeutics. Most safety findings are like \u201ctrees falling in the forest\u201d \u2013 with no one hearing the noise. Our objective was to describe the outcomes from the findings of the pharmacovigilance efforts from the SONAR group. Methods: SONAR investigators reviewed practice and policy outcomes to our identification of adverse drug reactions with hematologic implications. Data sources used were PubMed, the Food and Drud Administration (FDA) files, and the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book). Results:  Drug . SONAR finding . Confirmation . Peak at risk per year . #pts/deaths . % of ADR reports in the FDA database . FDA Response . Market Action .

Identifying and reporting sADRs can have marked beneficial effects on medical care. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
