    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4796 Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults causing the highest number of annual deaths secondary to leukemias in the United States. Age, cytogenetics, molecular features are the most important factors in the prognosis, whereby increased age and monosomal karyotypes carry the worst prognosis. The most favorable cytogenetics are patients with normal karyotypes, who can receive standard therapy. Aim: Study the overall survival (OS) of AML/High risk MDS treated according to standard of care at a community teaching hospital. Methods: A retrospective study of AML & High risk MDS patients treated at AGMC, Akron, Ohio USA, during 2002\u20132010. After IRB approval, we reviewed patient demographics, diagnosis types/subtypes, treatment, and cytogenetics. Patients were classified as low-intermediate risk or high risk according to cytogenetics background using WHO criteria. We also classified patients according to presence of bone marrow fibrosis and health insurance coverage at the time of diagnosis. Overall survival (OS) rates were determined by Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis. Prognostic factors were evaluated by Log Rank analysis. Results: We were able to classify 98 (75%) pts, with 52 (53%) pts as high risk and 46 (47%) pts as low-intermediate risk. Median age was 55 years (range: 19\u201390), 43 (45%) pts were older than 75 years. AML pts made up 71%, 45 patients (35%) had complex cytogenetics, and 15% had AML arise from MDS. Median survival overall was 22.4 weeks; 14.4 weeks for high risk and 53.8 weeks for low risk (p<0.01). Median survival for pts greater than 75 years was 11.5 weeks compared to 35.8 weeks for those younger than 75 years (p<0.05). We classified 103 pts according to insurance; 29 pts had private insurance and 74 pts had medicare/Medicaid. Cox regression analysis was performed to examine for the net effect of each of age, insurance, and fibrosis status after controlling for the effect of other variables in the model. Data showed that survival is inversely related to age at diagnosis (p value=.01) while the variables fibrosis status, medicaid/uninsured, and private insurance did not contribute significantly to the model (p value=.97 and.14.34, respectively). Conclusions: No significant differences in OS regarding insurance status or presence of bone marrow fibrosis. This was likely because the majority of pts received standard of care therapy and overall survival, in general, was low in the study population. OS was lowest in high risk patients and those greater than 75 years, and was better in low risk pts and those younger than 75 years respectively. Early referral to a specialized center, or possible clinical trial enrollment may be an alternative way to approach those pts. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
