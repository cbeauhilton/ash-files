    "abstract_text": "Background The gain-of-function point mutation in Janus kinase 2 exon 14 gene (JAK2-V617F) influences the diagnosis of bcr/abl-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs). We previously reported that analyzing platelets is advantageous in detecting the JAK2-V617F mutation, particularly in essential thrombocythemia (ET), when compared to granulocytes. However, there have been few reports analyzing the JAK2-V617F mutation in erythroid lineage cells, and comparing the mutation status in all three lineages. Method Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gunma University Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from all the patients. Heparinized peripheral blood was obtained from 113 patients with CMPDs (82 with ET, 25 with polycythemia vera (PV), and 6 with primary myelofibrosis (PMF). After centrifugation, platelets were collected from the upper plasma layer. Remaining blood was mixed with Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution and was subjected to Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. Granulocytes were obtained from the pellet. Mononuclear cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium; 5 \u00d7 10 5 cells were plated in duplicate in 1 ml of methylcellulose medium and cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % of carbon dioxide at 37\u00b0C for 14 days in the presence of erythropoietin to obtain erythroid colonies (BFU-E). T-cells were obtained from the remaining mononuclear cells using anti-CD3 immunoconjugated magnetic beads. After extraction of DNA from granulocytes, T-cells and BFU-E, and RNA extraction from granulocytes and platelets, PCR amplification and sequencing of exon 14 of the Jak2 gene was performed to confirm the presence of JAK2-V617F mutations. To confirm the mutation status of granulocytes, T-cells and BFU-E, allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) was performed. Results For ET, 57 out of 82 patients (69.5%) had the JAK2-V617F mutation. In the 57 patients with the JAK2-V617F mutation, 38 (67%) had the mutation in all three lineages, 5 had the mutation in granulocytes and platelets, 2 had the mutation in platelets and BFU-E, 10 patients had the mutation only in platelets and 2 patients had the mutation only in BFU-E. In contrast, for PV, 22/25 patients (88%) had the JAK2-V617F mutation. Of note, in 22 patients having JAK2-V617F mutation, 20 (91%) were JAK2-V617F mutation-positive in all three lineages; the remaining two patients had the mutation in either platelets or BFU-E. The frequency of JAK2-V617F in all three lineages was significantly higher in PV than in ET (p < 0.05). For PMF, 5 of 6 patients had the mutation in granulocytes, and 3 of these had it in all three lineages. Conclusion Among JAK2-V617F mutation-positive CMPDs, most PV patients had the JAK2-V617F mutation in all three lineages, thus suggesting that the JAK2-V617F mutation occurs in progenitor cell(s) common to granulocytes, platelets and erythrocytes. In contrast, only 67% of ET patients had the JAK2-V617F mutation in three lineages; in the remaining cases, not all of the three lineages have the mutation. This difference in lineages showing the JAK2-V617F mutation between the ET and PV may be related to the pathophysiological differences in ET and PV. Furthermore, the heterogeneous mutation status in ET may be related to its heterogeneous clinical manifestation.",
