    "abstract_text": "Background : Ibr, an established standard of care in CLL, is a once-daily Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor with significant progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival benefit shown in multiple randomized phase 3 studies in first-line CLL. Ven, an oral BCL-2 inhibitor approved as a single agent or combined with rituximab or obinutuzumab for CLL treatment, achieves high rates of undetectable MRD (uMRD). Ibr and Ven, with distinct and complementary mechanisms of action, work synergistically to mobilize CLL cells from lymph nodes and lymphoid niches, enhance cell killing, and eliminate distinct CLL cell populations. CAPTIVATE (PCYC-1142; NCT02910583) is an international, multicenter phase 2 study evaluating first-line Ibr + Ven in 2 cohorts: MRD and Fixed-Duration (FD). Patients (pts) first received 3 cycles of Ibr followed by 12 cycles of combined Ibr + Ven. In the primary analysis of the MRD cohort, pts with Confirmed uMRD who after fixed duration treatment were randomized to placebo or continued Ibr had similar post-randomization 1-year DFS rates (95% and 100%, respectively) (Wierda, ASH 2020). Two-year post-randomization results are presented. Methods : Pts aged <70 years with previously untreated CLL received 3 cycles of Ibr lead-in then 12 cycles of combined Ibr + Ven (oral Ibr 420 mg/day; oral Ven ramp-up to 400 mg/day). During cycle 16, pts with Confirmed uMRD (defined as uMRD serially over \u22652 assessments \u22653 mo apart, and in both peripheral blood [PB] and bone marrow [BM]) were randomized 1:1 to receive double-blind treatment with placebo or single-agent Ibr. Pts who did not meet the definition of Confirmed uMRD were randomized 1:1 to receive open-label treatment with single-agent Ibr or continued Ibr + Ven. Endpoints presented include 2-year DFS rate (defined as survival without progression [PD] or MRD relapse post-randomization) in pts with Confirmed uMRD randomized to placebo vs Ibr, rates of uMRD (<10 -4 by 8-color flow cytometry), investigator-assessed best response per iwCLL, investigator-assessed PFS, and adverse events (AEs). Results : 164 pts were enrolled. Median age was 58 years (range, 28-69). High-risk features included unmutated IGHV (60% of pts), del(17p)/ TP53 mutation (20%), complex karyotype (19%), and del(11q) without del(17p) (17%). After 12 cycles of Ibr + Ven, 149 pts were randomized: Confirmed uMRD to placebo (n=43) or Ibr (n=43); without Confirmed uMRD to Ibr (n=31) or Ibr + Ven (n=32). Median overall follow-up was 38.2 mo (range, 15.0-47.9); median post-randomization follow-up was 24.0 mo (range, 5.8-33.1). In pts with Confirmed uMRD randomized to placebo versus Ibr, no new DFS events occurred since the primary analysis; 2-year DFS rates post-randomization remained unchanged at 95% (placebo) vs 100% (Ibr), for a 4.7% difference (95% CI - 1.6-10.9) and overall log-rank P =0.1573 (Figure 1). In the placebo and Ibr arms post-randomization, modest improvements were observed in complete response (CR) rates, including CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi) (Figure 2). Estimated 36-mo PFS rates were 95% with placebo and 100% with Ibr. In pts without Confirmed uMRD randomized to Ibr vs Ibr + Ven, greater improvements in best uMRD rates and CR/CRi rates were observed with Ibr + Ven than with Ibr post-randomization (Figure 2). Estimated 36-mo PFS rates were 97% with both Ibr and Ibr + Ven. Median treatment duration was 36.8 mo (range, 0.5-47.9) in all pts (N=164). Modest differences in AEs were observed across treatment arms post-randomization. During the overall study period across all-treated pts, the most frequent grade 3/4 AEs were neutropenia (36%), hypertension (10%), thrombocytopenia (5%), and diarrhea (5%). With up to 48 mo of treatment, AEs led to discontinuation of Ibr or Ven in 13% of pts; no new safety signals emerged. Conclusions : First-line Ibr + Ven is an all-oral, once-daily, chemotherapy-free regimen that provides deep responses in pts with CLL. With an additional year of follow-up and no new MRD relapses, PDs or deaths in pts with confirmed uMRD, the 2-year DFS rate in the MRD-guided placebo arm remained high at 95% while 3-year PFS rates were \u226595% across all randomized treatment arms. The results in pts with Confirmed uMRD support the potential for treatment-free remission with fixed-duration treatment, including in pts with high-risk features. High rates of uMRD were achieved; the safety profile of Ibr + Ven was consistent with known safety profile for each agent.
