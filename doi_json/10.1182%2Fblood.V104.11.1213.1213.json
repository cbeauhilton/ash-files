    "abstract_text": "A 2.9 Kb deletion of 5\u2032HS3 (\u03945\u2032HS3) or a 234 bp deletion of the 5\u2032HS3 core (\u03945\u2032HS3c) in a 213 Kb human \u03b2-globin locus yeast artificial chromosome (\u03b2-YAC) abrogate \u03b5-globin gene expression during primitive erythropoiesis in \u03b2-YAC transgenic mice, suggesting that HS sequences of the LCR are involved directly in \u03b5-globin gene activation. The reduction of \u03b5-globin gene transcription in \u03945\u2032HS3 or \u03945\u2032HS3c \u03b2-YAC transgenics can be explained by two hypotheses. The first is site-specificity. The interaction between the LCR and the \u03b5-globin gene promoter involves specific sequences of 5\u2032HS3 and specific sequences of the \u03b5-globin gene promoter. When 5\u2032HS3 or its core is deleted, these interactions do not take place and \u03b5-globin gene transcription is diminished. The second hypothesis is change in conformation of the LCR. Normally, in the embryonic stage, the LCR achieves a three-dimensional conformation that favors interaction with the first gene in the complex, i.e., the \u03b5-globin gene. When 5\u2032HS3 is deleted, an alternate conformation is assumed that decreases the chance that there will be an interaction between the LCR and the \u03b5-globin gene. However, the LCR interacts with the next gene in order, the \u03b3-globin gene. In \u03945\u2032HS3c \u03b2-YAC mice, \u03b3-globin gene expression is normal during primitive erythropoiesis, but is extinguished in the fetal stage of definitive erythropoiesis. These data suggest that a conformational change occurs in the \u03945\u2032HS3c LCR during the switch from embryonic to definitive erythropoiesis, from one that supports \u03b3-globin gene expression to one that does not. Alternately, the embryonic trans-acting environment may allow the mutant LCR to interact with and activate the \u03b3-globin genes, but the fetal trans-acting environment may not support this interaction in the absence of the 5\u2032HS3 core. To distinguish between these possibilities, \u03b2-YAC lines were produced in which the \u03b5-globin gene was replaced with a second marked \u03b2-globin gene (\u03b2 m ), coupled to either an intact LCR, a 2.9 Kb 5\u2032HS3 deletion or a 234 bp 5\u2032HS3 core deletion. \u03945\u2032HS3c \u0394\u03b5::\u03b2 m \u03b2-YAC mice expressed \u03b2 m -globin throughout development beginning at day 10 in the yolk sac. \u03b3-globin was expressed in the embryonic yolk sac, but not in the fetal liver. Some wild-type \u03b2-globin was expressed in addition to \u03b2 m -globin in adult mice. The \u03b3-globin phenotype is consistent with published data on \u03945\u2032HS3c \u03b2-YAC mice. Although \u03b5-globin was not expressed in \u03945\u2032HS3c \u03b2-YAC mice, \u03b2 m -globin was expressed in \u03945\u2032HS3c \u0394\u03b5::\u03b2 m \u03b2-YAC embryos, demonstrating that the 5\u2032HS3 core was necessary for \u03b5-globin expression during embryonic erythropoiesis, but not for \u03b2 m -globin expression. These data support a site specificity model of LCR HS-globin gene interaction. In addition, nuclear ligation experiments provided evidence for a specific physical interaction between 5\u2032HS3 and the \u03b3-globin promoter during fetal definitive erythropoiesis, further supporting a site specificity model.",
