    "abstract_text": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of Rituximab on Epstein-Barr virus infection disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in children. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed based on clinical data of 25 children with median age of 6 years, (3~14 years) diagnosed as EBV infection and received Rituximab from Jan. 2012 to Jun. 2014 in our center. Of them, 3 patients were diagnosed as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD). All patients received Rituximab at dose of 375 mg/m2 once a week for 4 sequence weeks or discontinued therapy when EBV viral loads was <500 copies/mL two times consecutively. The complete remission (CR) was defined as EBV viral loads <500 copies/mL consecutively at least two time and without any related clinical symptoms. Side effects during infusion were evaluated by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. RESULTS: The median EBV-infection time was on day 70 (18~200) after HSCT. Each of patients received a median of 2 (1~4) infusions. There were no severe side effects during the infusion of Rituximab. The cumulative complete remission (CR) rate were 88% in total. The CR rate was 56.0\u00b19.9 %, 80.0\u00b18.0%, 84.0\u00b17.3%, and 88.0\u00b16.5%, respectively, in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th week. Two patients died, one due to infections and the other died of hepatitis while receiving therapy. The CR rate was 100% in patients with PTLD (3/3). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest Rituximab is safe and effective when treating children with EBV infection disease after allo-HSCT. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
