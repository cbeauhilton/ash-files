    "abstract_text": "Introduction and Objective : Inhibitors to coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) are the most serious complication of haemophilia A treatment. Previously untreated patients (PUPs) are at the greatest risk of inhibitors, which generally occur within the first 20 exposure days (ED) to FVIII. Immune tolerance induction (ITI) is the only clinically proven strategy for eradication of inhibitors . We present a case series of six PUPs with severe haemophilia A and inhibitors who underwent ITI with simoctocog alfa (Nuwiq \u00ae ), a 4 th generation human cell-line-derived recombinant FVIII approved for treatment of haemophilia A. Materials and Methods: Six male PUPs with severe haemophilia A who developed FVIII inhibitors after treatment with simoctocog alfa were started on ITI with simoctocog alfa. Primarily, we assessed the success of simoctocog alfa in patients with inhibitors. Success of ITI was determined based on undetectable inhibitor titre (< 0.6 BU/ml), FVIII recovery \u2265 66% and half-life \u2265 6 hours. Secondary objectives were to assess bleeding rate, tolerability and safety in patients with inhibitors treated with simoctocog alfa ITI. Results: The age of the patients at the start of ITI ranged from 8 to 186 months. Four of the patients were Caucasian, and two were African. All patients had a F8 mutation associated with high risk of ITI failure and two patients had an additional risk factor for ITI failure. The number of EDs prior to inhibitor development ranged from 9 to 33, and the peak inhibitor titre ranged from 0.9 to 114 BU. For ITI, five patients were treated with 100 IU/kg simoctocog alfa daily, and one with 90 IU/kg every other day. One patient achieved complete tolerisation and is now on prophylaxis at normal doses, having achieved an undetectable inhibitor titre after 9 months. This was despite an inhibitor titre \u2265 10 BU/mL at ITI start, which is considered a poor prognosis factor for ITI success. Three other patients achieved an undetectable inhibitor titre after 1, 6 and 18 months of ITI, and FVIII recovery has normalised but half-life remains short and they are on weaning doses as the half-life extends. One patient discontinued ITI with simoctocog alfa after 15 months due to an increasing inhibitor level. This patient was 15 years old at ITI start, and older age is associated with poor ITI outcome. Additionally, his haemophilia A was untreated for 15 years, during which time he developed severe arthropathy. One patient, who started ITI 3 months ago, has an ongoing inhibitor titre and continues on ITI with simoctocog alfa. Conclusions: In a case series of six patients treated with simoctocog alfa for ITI, who all had poor prognosis factors for ITI success, four patients (67%) to date have achieved an undetectable inhibitor titre. These data suggest that ITI with simoctocog alfa may be an effective treatment approach in haemophilia A patients with inhibitors.
