    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of heterogeneous hematopoietic stem cell disorders and manifested as ineffective hematopoiesis, refractory cytopenia and a propensity to evolve into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 ( IDH1/2 ) mutations are common in both MDS and AML. Mutated IDH produces R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG) which inhibits multiple \u03b1-ketoglutarate/\u03b1-KG-dependent dioxygenases by competing against \u03b1-KG binding. Recent studies have demonstrated that R-2-HG can abrogates leukemic growth and induce leukemia cell death. Several nonapoptotic cell death have been identified, including phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PPRP)-1 mediated necrosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis and necroptosis. By now, the specific type of cell death by which R-2-HG exerts anti-tumor effects is still unknown. Results: (1) (2R)-Octyl-2-HG exhibited anti-tumor effect on SKM-1, THP-1, Molm-13, HL-60 cell lines and bone marrow mononuclear cells from MDS and AML patients in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The overexpression of IDH2 mutation induced by doxycycline significantly decreased the viability of AML cell lines, and the inhibition rate was related to the dose of doxycycline. (2R)-Octyl-2-HG promotes apoptosis and causes G0/G1 phase arrest. (2) R-2-HG leads to increased expression of RIPK1 in high-risk MDS cells. The results of gene enrichment analysis indicated that the apoptotic pathway was enriched in (2R)-Octyl-2-HG groups, and the expression of RIPK1 gene was increased in all three (SKM-1, NOMO-1 and MA9.3ITD) (2R)-Octyl-2-HG groups. After treatment with (2R)-Octyl-2-HG, the mRNA and protein expression levels of RIPK1 gene were increased. (3) R-2-HG triggers RIPK1-dependent necroptosis and occurs earlier than apoptosis. Within 10 hours after treatment with (2R)-Octyl-2-HG, cell membrane permeability was disrupted, interactions between RIPK1 and caspase 8 increased, as well as phosphorylated MLKL level. However, caspase activity did not increase significantly, suggesting that necroptosis occurs earlier than apoptosis. With RIPK1 inhibitor Necrostatin-1 and (2R)-Octyl-2-HG co-treating cells, proliferation inhibition was reduced, cell membrane permeability was more stable and RIPK1-caspase8 complex was difficult to form. The same phenomenon occurs in SKM-1 cells stably transfected with RIPK1 shRNA virus, suggesting that RIPK1-dependent necroptosis is involved in cell death caused by (2R)-Octyl-2-HG. (4) In vivo experiments demonstrated that necroptosis by R-2-HG is dependent on the expression of RIPK. In RIPK1 shRNA MDS mice, the tumor burden showed a decreasing trend, but did not show a significant change in the R-2-HG treatment group. Treatment of scramble shRNA MDS mice with R-2-HG resulted in significantly smaller tumors in the spleen and less engrafment of CD45+ cells in bone marrow. (5) Low RIPK1 expression predicts poor prognosis in MDS patients. Data from the TCGA and GEO public databases indicate that RIPK1 expression is reduced in MDS and AML patients compared to healthy controls. Survival analysis showed that patients with lower RIPK1 expression levels had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than patients with higher RIPK1 expression levels. MDS patients with lower RIPK1 expression levels progress to leukemia more frequently. (6) Inhibition of KDM2B induces necroptosis independently. Western blot assay shows the knockdown of KDM2B, upregulation of RIPK1 and increased levels of p-MLKL. Analysis of cell numbers showed that proliferation ceased from 4 days after doxycycline treatment onwards in shKDM2B cells. Co-IP assay shows the formation of RIPK1-caspase8 complex. Conclusion: This study confirmed that R-2-HG inhibited the viability of MDS and AML cells. R-2-HG increased the expression of RIPK1 in MDS cells, inducing necroptosis. Necroptosis occurred earlier than apoptosis. Inhibition of RIPK1 can alleviate the inhibitory effect of R-2-HG on MDS and AML cells. Clinical studies have shown that low expression of the RIPK1 gene is associated with poor prognosis in patients with MDS and AML. MDS patients with low expression of RIPK1 was more likely to progress to leukemia. Inhibition of KDM2B can induce necroptosis independently.
