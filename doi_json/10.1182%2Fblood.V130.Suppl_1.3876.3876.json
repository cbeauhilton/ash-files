    "abstract_text": "Background: Chemoimmunotherapy is standard frontline therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Rituximab (R) added to hyper-CVAD (HCVAD) has been shown to improve complete remission duration (CRD) and overall survival (OS) in patients (pts) with CD20-positive ALL with \u226520% CD20 expression. Ofatumumab (O) is a type I human antibody that binds to a distinct CD20 epitope compared to rituximab, and induces more potent antibody-dependent and complement mediated cytotoxicity in vitro . We hypothesized that combining ofatumumab with HCVAD may improve outcomes in CD20+ ALL. Methods: We designed a single-center phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of O-HCVAD in adults with newly diagnosed ALL with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) and CD20+ \u22651%. Patients (pts) received intensive therapy with 4 cycles (cy) of HCVAD [odd cy 1, 3, 5, 7 comprised of fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine (VCR), doxorubicin, dexamethasone] alternating with 4 cy of methotrexate-cytarabine (MTX-ara-C, even cy 2, 4, 6, 8). Ofatumumab was administered during cy 1-4 on day 1 and 11 \u00b1 2 of cy 1 and 3; and day 1 and 8 \u00b1 2 of cy 2 and 4. The first dose of ofatumumab was 300 mg and subsequent doses were 2000 mg. Pts received POMP maintenance (6-mercaptopurine, MTX, VCR, prednisone) for nearly 30 months (mo), and intensification with MTX-PEGylated asparaginase on mo 6 and 18 and with O-HCVAD on mo 7 and 19. Intrathecal MTX-ara-C was used for central nervous system prophylaxis. Radiation was used for bulky mediastinal disease if indicated. Results: We enrolled 68 pts with Ph- CD20+ ALL between 07/2011 and 05/2017. Four pts had received 1 cy of chemotherapy prior to enrollment and 3 of them were in CR at enrollment. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Of the 65 pts evaluable for response, 64 pts (98%) achieved CR/CRp. 39/62 (63%) achieved negative minimal residual disease (MRD) at time of CR, and 61/67 pts (91%) achieved negative MRD overall, as assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry. Median time to negative MRD was 0.7 mo (range, 0.4-7.8). Pts received median of 7 intensive phase cy (range, 1-8). Most common non-hematologic grade 3/4 toxicities were infections during consolidation in 75% of pts, infections during induction in 55% pts, and hypokalemia in 51% pts. Median time to recovery of platelets and neutrophils after cy 1 were 21 days (range, 0-60) and 19 days (range, 0-41), respectively. At 22 mo median follow-up, 52 pts (76%) are alive; 17 pts (25%) are receiving maintenance, 15 pts (22%) have relapsed, 12 pts (18%) have completed maintenance, and 11 pts (16%) have received allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) in first remission. The 2-year CRD and OS rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. Out of the 16 pts (24%) pts who died, 1 pt had early death from sepsis; 7 pts died after morphologic relapse, 5 pts died in CR/CRp, 1 pt died after MRD+ relapse, 1 pt died after ASCT, and 1 pt died after relapse post-ASCT. Of the pts who died in CR/CRp, 2 pts died from sepsis, 2 pts from therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, and 1 pt from disseminated adenovirus infection in post-ASCT setting. The 2-yr OS was similar in pts with <20% and \u226520% CD20 expression (75% vs 82%). In pts with CD20 expression \u226520%, there was a trend for better OS favoring O-HCVAD compared to a historical control group treated with R-HCVAD ( fig. 1a ). In pts with CD20 expression <20%, OS was comparable to a historical control group treated with HCVAD only ( fig. 1b ). Conclusions: O-HCVAD is safe, highly effective, and produces durable responses in adults with Ph- CD20+ ALL.
