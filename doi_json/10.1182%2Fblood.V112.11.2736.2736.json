    "abstract_text": "Despite heterogeneity of phenotypes, multiple myeloma (MM) can be classified into two major groups: hyperdiploid (HRD) tumors with 48\u201374 chromosomes, which typically have extra copies of at least four of the eight odd chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 19, and 21; and non-hyperdiploid (NHRD) tumors, which usually have immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IGH ) translocations and 74 chromosomes. Human myeloma cell lines (HMCL) with a typical HRD genotype are lacking. The OH-2 HMCL was derived from extramedullary myeloma, and retains the same HRD phenotype as the primary tumor, with extra copies of chromosomes 3, 7, 15, 19, and 21, as demonstrated by array comparative genomic hybridization. This provides a unique example of an HMCL and the corresponding primary tumor that share the same HRD phenotype. Also Spectral Karyotyping showed the same HRD phenotype. By fluorescence in situ hybridization it was shown that OH-2 does not have an IGH or Ig lambda light chain translocation. Instead, both the HMCL and the primary tumor have complex translocations involving chromosomes 2, 8, and 20. The translocation juxtaposes MAFB near MYC and the Ig kappa (IGK) enhancer. Both MYC and MAFB are highly expressed, as shown by microarray analysis, and are thought to be dysregulated by the IGK enhancer. Both OH-2 HMCL and the primary tumor cells express high levels of Cyclin D2, an expected consequence of the enhanced MAFB level. OH-2 has a phenotype similar to the 20% of HRD MM tumors that express increased levels of Cyclin D2 but not Cyclin D1 and could be a good in vitro model for studies of this subgroup of MM. OH-2 is dependent on medium containing human serum and growth-promoting cytokines like IL-6 or IL-21, reflecting the critical role of the microenvironment for growth of MM cells."
