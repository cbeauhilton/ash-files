    "abstract_text": "Although trisomy 8 as the sole chromosome aberration is the most common numerical abnormality in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), next to nothing is known about its pathogenetic effects. Considering that +8 is a frequent secondary change in AML and MDS, cryptic - and possibly primary - genetic aberrations may occur in cases with trisomy 8 as the apparently single anomaly. To date, however, no such hidden anomalies have been reported. We performed a high resolution genome-wide array-based comparative genome hybridization (array CGH) analysis of ten AML/MDS cases with isolated +8, using an array set containing >30,000 BAC and PAC clones. Array CGH revealed intra-chromosomal imbalances, not corresponding to known genomic polymorphisms, in 5/10 cases, comprising ten duplications and hemizygous deletions ranging in size from 0.5 to 2.2 Mb. Most notably, a 1.8 Mb hemizygous deletion at 7p14.1, which had occurred prior to the +8, was identified in one MDS transforming to AML. Furthermore, a hemizygous deletion at 12p13.2, including ETV6 , was present in one case. The remaining eight imbalances involved more than 40 genes. The present results show that cryptic genetic abnormalities are frequent in trisomy 8-positive AML and MDS cases and that +8 as the sole cytogenetic aberration is not always the primary genetic event.",
