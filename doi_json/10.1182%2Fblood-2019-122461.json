    "abstract_text": "Background : The combination of lenalidomide+rituximab (R 2 ) recently showed superior efficacy vs R-placebo in patients (pts) with R/R iNHL (Leonard et al. J Clin Oncol 2019). Based on these AUGMENT study results, R 2 was approved by the US FDA for treatment of adult pts with previously treated follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). Advanced age at diagnosis is a risk factor in pts with iNHL. We performed post-hoc subgroup analyses by age from AUGMENT and data here focus on pts age \u2265 70 y. Methods : AUGMENT (NCT01938001) is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized phase III study of R 2 vs R-placebo in pts with FL grade 1-3a or MZL previously treated with \u2265 1 systemic therapy with R/R disease but not refractory to rituximab. Pts were randomized 1:1 to R 2 or R-placebo. R 2 was oral lenalidomide 20 mg/d, d1-21/28 for 12c plus rituximab IV 375 mg/m 2 weekly in c1 and d1 of c2-5. R-placebo was rituximab+placebo on the same schedule. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) per 2007 IWG response criteria (without PET) as assessed by IRC (central review). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TTNLT) and safety. Post-hoc analyses were performed by dividing pts into age < 70 y and \u2265 70 y subgroups, the latter group considered unfit for chemotherapy. Results : Of 358 pts randomized (R 2 , n = 178; R-placebo, n = 180), 267 pts were age < 70 y (R 2 , n = 131; R-placebo, n = 136), and 91 pts were age \u2265 70 y (R 2 , n = 47; R-placebo, n = 44). Baseline characteristics including histology, disease status, and prior treatments are shown in the table and were similar across treatment arms in pts \u2265 70 y. At a median follow-up of 28.3 mo, the study met its primary endpoint of PFS, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.34-0.62; P < 0.0001) in the overall population. R 2 had superior PFS vs R-placebo in both < 70 and \u2265 70 y subgroups, with HR of 0.41 (95% CI, 0.29-0.59) and HR of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.37-1.18), respectively. In pts \u2265 70 y, median PFS with R 2 vs R-placebo was 24.9 vs 14.3 mo; ORR/CR was 81%/26% vs 59%/16%; and TTNLT was not reached in either arm. Efficacy results for all pts and those < 70 y are reported in the table; notably in pts receiving R 2 , mPFS was longer in pts < 70 y vs \u2265 70 y (39.4 mo [95% CI, 22.9-NE] vs 24.9 mo [95% CI, 16.4-NE]). In pts \u2265 70 y, any-grade adverse events (AEs) with a \u2265 10 % difference between R 2 vs R-placebo included neutropenia (63% vs 11%), constipation (33% vs 16%), cough (33% vs 16%), leukopenia (26% vs 2%), anemia (24% vs 9%), pyrexia (24% vs 9%), pruritus/pruritus generalized (24% vs 2%), muscle spasms (22% vs 11%), rash/rash maculopapular (22% vs 5%), headache (20% vs 9%), thrombocytopenia (17% vs 2%), dyspepsia (13% vs 2%), influenza (13% vs 2%), back pain (7% vs 18%), and nasopharyngitis (4% vs 16%). Also, tumor flare was reported in 9% vs 0% of pts, respectively. In pts \u2265 70 y, 75% of R 2 pts vs 36% of R-placebo pts had \u2265 1 grade 3/4 AE, mainly due to neutropenia (50% vs 7%). All other grade 3/4 AEs occurred in < 10% of pts \u2265 70 y in both treatment arms. One grade 5 AE occurred in pts \u2265 70 y (R-placebo arm). In the R 2 arm, the median number of treatment cycles was 12 for both the < 70 y vs \u2265 70 y subgroups; however, fewer older pts completed 12 cycles of lenalidomide (76% vs 57%), and more started lenalidomide at the lower dose of 10 mg (6% vs 35%) because of low creatinine clearance, respectively. In the R 2 < 70 y and \u2265 70 y subgroups, the average daily dose of lenalidomide was 17.9 mg/d (range, 5.6-20.0) and 14.4 mg/d (range 4.2-20.0), and median relative dose intensity was 95% and 86%, respectively. Conclusions : Similar to the results in the original population, R 2 showed superior efficacy vs rituximab monotherapy (plus placebo) as measured by the primary end point of PFS and secondary end points of ORR and CR in pts with R/R FL grade 1-3a and MZL irrespective of age. The efficacy and safety profiles of R 2 and R-placebo in pts \u2265 70 y were similar to those reported in the overall population. Older pts treated with R 2 vs R-placebo had superior mPFS (24.9 vs 14.3 mo). They were more likely to start lenalidomide at a lower dose and had lower median dose intensity which may have contributed to their shorter mPFS vs younger pts receiving R 2 . These data show that R 2 maintained efficacy improvements vs R-placebo in pts \u2265 70 y, despite higher unfit status and lower overall lenalidomide treatment/exposure. Thus, R 2 is an effective and available treatment option for pts with iNHL, including those with advanced age.
