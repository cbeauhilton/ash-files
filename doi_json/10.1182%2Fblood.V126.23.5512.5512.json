    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION ASTC is the standard treatment in multiple hematologic diseases; unfortunately most patients do not have a compatible family donor, URD ASCT is an alternative to those patients. There is evidence from developed countries that outcomes may be similar regardless the donor, but there is not enough information from Latin America regarding survival after URD ASCT. We compared survival at 1 and 3 years from patients transplanted using related or unrelated donors in a single center in Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS Paired analysis was performed comparing one URD ASCT with one or two RD ASCT with similar characteristic in terms of age, diagnosis (AML, ALL, aplasia, CML, MDS), EBMT risk, year of transplant and conditioning regimen. Chi-square or Fisher exact test was used to compare the groups (p<0.05). The survival curves of Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test (p<0.05) were used to estimate the probabilities of one (OS1) and three (OS3) overall survival in different groups according to EMBT score risk. RESULTS 28 URD ASCT were performed between 2011 and 2014, 24 of those (18 matched and 6 missmatched URD ASCT) were paired with 41 RD ASCT. Of those 62% were males, mean age was 33.4 years, 70.8% patients were in early stages, almost 60% had more than 12 months interval between diagnosis and transplant. Most common diagnoses were acute lymphoid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. 80% of donors where found through NMDP. No significant differences in sex, age, disease status (early, intermediate, late), time interval from diagnosis to transplantation, and patient-donor sex combination, ranked according to EBMT risk score, were find between the tow groups. Median follow-up was 322 days (range 165-693), for the whole group. There were no significant differences in the OS1 or OS3 between URD o RD ASCT, in different EBMT score groups. Low risk: OS1: URD 86.6% vs RD 75.8%, p = 0.46; OS3: 86.6% vs 68.9%, p = 0.28. High risk OS1 75% vs 63.6%, p=0.92; OS3 75% vs 63.6%, p=0.92. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort of patients, the type of donor had no influence in the outcome measured in terms of OS. This is the first experience with URD ASCT in Colombia; longer follow up of this cohort is needed to confirm this results, but our findings suggest this transplantation modality is a real alternative to patients in our country in need of a transplant without an HLA identical related donor.
