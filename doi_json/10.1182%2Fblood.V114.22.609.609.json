    "abstract_text": "Abstract 609 HM1.24/CD317 or BST2, a cell surface protein highly expressed on malignant plasma cells, represents a potential target of immunotherapy for multiple myeloma (MM). Here we characterized XmAb\u00ae5592, a novel Fc-engineered and humanized anti-HM1.24 antibody (Ab), and studied mechanisms of its anti-MM activity. XmAb\u00ae5592, with double amino acid substitution in Fc region of the wild type IgG1, has approximately 40-fold and 10-fold increases in affinity for Fc gamma receptor III (Fc\u03b3RIIIa) and (Fc\u03b3RIIa), respectively, expressed on effector cells including NK cells. The Fv region of XmAb\u00ae5592 was humanized and engineered to achieve high affinity and specificity of binding to HM1.24-expressing target cells. XmAb\u00ae5592 reacts against a panel of MM cell lines (n=19) which are both sensitive or resistant to current anti-MM conventional and novel therapies. Importantly, it triggers 10-100-fold higher antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against these MM cell lines than a native/non Fc-engineered version (anti-HM1.24 IgG1) of the Ab. Specifically, the maximum specific lysis of MM1S, MM1R, and RPMI8226 target cells induced by XmAb\u00ae5592 is at a concentration of 0.001-0.01 \u03bcg/ml, whereas the IgG1 analog did not induce maximum cell lysis until 0.1 \u03bcg/ml. The maximum 100% specific lysis of INA-6 target cells occurred at 0.1 \u03bcg/ml of XmAb5592, in contrast to 60% maximum lysis induced by10 \u03bcg/ml of the IgG1 analog. Since the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment induces resistance in MM cells to conventional therapies, we next asked whether XmAb\u00ae5592 induced ADCC against MM cells even in the presence of BM stromal cells (BMSCs). Importantly, XmAb\u00ae5592 triggered significant ADCC against MM1S, MM1R, and INA-6 MM cells in the context of BMSCs. XmAb5592 also reacts against patient MM cells, and triggers robust ADCC against CD138-purified patient MM cells in assays using NK effector cells from normal donors. Furthermore, cross-linked XmAb5592 inhibited RMPI 8226 cell growth in the absence of effector cells. The in vivo efficacy of XmAb\u00ae5592 was next evaluated in murine subcutaneous (sc) xenograft murine models using RPMI 8226 cells. Administration of XmAb5592 (9mg/kg, ip, 2x/week for 4 weeks) led to a significant reduction in growth of established tumors in vivo compared to a non-engineered IgG1 anti-HM1.24 analog. At termination of the study. 7/15 mice were tumor free in the XmAb- treated group versus only 1/15 tumor free mice in the IgG1 analog treated group. An anti-HM1.24 antibody with Fc region engineered to completely ablate binding to Fc\u03b3Rs (knock-out) behaved equivalent to the PBS vehicle control in these studies, again underlining the significance of interaction with Fc\u03b3R for anti-tumor efficacy. These results therefore suggest that XmAb5592, an anti-HM1.24 antibody engineered for improved effector function and antitumor potency in vitro and in vivo, is a promising next-generation immunotherapeutic for MM.
