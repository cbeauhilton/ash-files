    "abstract_text": "The 2nd-generation bcr-abl inhibitor nilotinib is more potent than imatinib (IC50 200nM: Y253H, E255K, E255V, F359C) representing 13% (11/85) of all patients assessed for baseline mutation, showed 13% (1/11) HR and 13% (1/11) MCyR compared to 74% (17/28) and 18% (5/28) respectively in the mutant group with IC50 of \u2264200 nM. The nilotinib resistant T315I mutation occurred in 5 pts. Only one of these 5 pts who had T315I and G250E dual mutation achieved HR conceivably reflecting the sensitivity of G250E or non-mutant clone to nilotinib. At the time of data analyses, 50% of pts with baseline mutation were free of disease progression versus 62% of pts without baseline mutation. Rate of progression was 64% (7/11) in the group with less sensitive mutations and 60% (3/5) in pts. with T315I. However, the mutants most frequently associated with progression were F359V and M244V both having 4/5 pts (80%) progressed. In summary, BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations were identified at baseline in 59% of all pts in this cohort and in 67% of pts with imatinib resistance. Responses were observed across a broad spectrum of mutant genotypes. The rate of responses and disease progression may be affected by the baseline mutation types, although a larger data set with longer follow up is needed to further establish the correlation."
