    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3928 Background: NK cells play a role in reducing relapse in hematological malignancy following AlloSCT (Dunbar et al, Haematologica , 2008). NK cell limitations include lack of tumor recognition and/or limited numbers of viable and functional NK cells (Shereck/Cairo et al, Ped Bld Can , 2007). NK ACI provide safe and effective therapy against tumor relapse; yet NK cells are limited to specific cancer types and not all patients demonstrate optimal response (Ruggieri et al. Science , 2002; Ljunggren et al. Nat Rev Immuno , 2007). To circumvent these limitations, methods to expand and activate PBMNCs with genetically engineered K562 cells expressing membrane bound IL-15 and 41BB ligand (K562-mbIL15-41BBL [modK562]; Imai/Campana et al, Blood , 2005) have shown to significantly increase NK cells in number and maintain heterogeneous KIR expression (Fusaki/Campana et al BJH, 2009). We have shown that CB NK cells can be activated/expanded and exhibit enhanced cytolytic activity when cultured in a cytokines/antibody cocktail (Ayello/Cairo et al, BBMT , 2006; Exp Heme , 2009). Objective: To evaluate CBNK expansion, activation, cytolytic mechanism and function against Burkitt lymphoma (BL) tumor target and its influence on NK cell mediated in-vitro and in-vivo cytotoxicity in NOD-SCID mice following stimulation with modK562 cells (generously supplied by D.Campana, St Jude's Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tx). Methods: Following 100GY irradiation, modK562cells were incubated 1:1 with CBMNCs in RPMI+IL-2 (10IU/ml) for 7 days in 5%CO 2 , 37\u00b0C. NK activation marker (LAMP-1), perforin and granzyme B were determined by flow cytometry. Cytotoxicty was determined via europium assay at 20:1 E:T ratio with Ramos (BL) tumor targets (ATCC). The mammalian expression construct (ffLucZeo-pcDNA (generously supplied by L.Cooper, MD, PhD) was transfected to BL cells using lipofectin and selected by zeocin for stable transfection. Six week old NOD-SCID mice received 5\u00d710 6 BL cells subcutaneously. Upon engraftment, xenografted NOD-SCID mice were divided in 5 groups: injected with PBS (control), BL only, 5\u00d710 6 wildtype (WT) K562 expanded (E) CBNK cells, modK562 expanded (E) CB NK cells (5\u00d710 6 ) and modK562 expanded (E) CBNK cells (5\u00d710 7 ). Ex-vivo ECBNK cells were injected weekly for 5 weeks and xenografted NOD-SCID mice were monitored by volumetric measurement of tumor size (Tomayko/Reynolds, Can Chemother Pharmac , 1989), bioluminescent imaging (Inoue et al Exp Heme , 2007) and survival. The survival distribution for each group was estimated using the Fisher exact test. Results: On Day 0, NK cells (CD56 + /3 - ) population was 3.9\u00b11.3%. After 7 days, modK562 expanded CBNK cells was significantly increased compared to WTK562 and media alone (72\u00b13.9 vs 43\u00b15.9 vs 9\u00b12.4%, p<0.01). This represented a 35-fold or 3374\u00b1385% increase of the input NK cell number. This was significantly increased compared to WTK562 (1771\u00b1300%, p<0.05). ModK562 ECBNK cells demonstrated increased perforin and granzyme B expression compared to WTK562 (42\u00b11.5 vs 15\u00b10.5%,p<0.001; 22\u00b10.5 vs 11\u00b10.3%,p<0.001, respectively). Cytotoxicity was against BL tumor targets was significantly increased (42\u00b13 vs 18\u00b12%,p<0.01), along with NK activation marker expression, CD107a (p<0.05). At 5 weeks, in-vivo studies demonstrated increased survival of NOD-SCID mice receiving both 5\u00d710 6 and 5\u00d710 7 modK562 ECBNK cells when compared to those with no treatment (p=0.05, p=0.0007, respectively). There was no difference in survival when comparing mice that received 5\u00d710 6 vs 5\u00d710 7 modK562 ECBNK cells (p=0.0894) at 5 weeks. Tumor volume of mice receiving either dose of modK562 ECBNK cells was significantly less than those receiving WTK562 ECBNK cells (1.92\u00b10.57 and 0.37\u00b10.05 vs 3.41\u00b10.25, p=0.0096 and p=0.0001, respectively). Conclusions: CBMNCs stimulated and expanded with modK562 cells results in significant expansion of CBNK cells with enhanced in-vitro cytotoxicity, significant receptor expression of NK activation marker (LAMP-1), and perforin and granzyme B. Furthermore, modK562 ECBNK cells leads to increased survival and lower tumor burden of NOD-SCID mice xenografted with BL. Future directions include modK562 ECBNK cells to be genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptor CD20 (MSCV-antiCD20-41BB-CD3 \u03b6) against CD20 + hematologic malignancies for future studies to evaluate whether targeting enhances in-vitro and in-vivo cytotoxicity.
