    "abstract_text": "Recent work in CLL and other lymphoproliferative disorders has established the importance of somatic mutations in the pathogenesis and prognosis of disease. MYD88 L265P mutations occur in approximately 30% of ABC diffuse large B cell lymphomas (ABC DLBCL) and 90% of Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia (WM) cases and have been shown to be an activating mutation in both cancers. MYD88 is an important adaptor protein for IL-1 and many Toll-like receptors, which signal via dimerization followed by formation of a complex of MYD88 with IRAK4 and IRAK1, leading to activation of IRAK4 kinase activity, IRAK1 phosphorylation and downstream activation of NF\u03baB. Previous work in CLL has demonstrated that MYD88 L265P mutations occur in a smaller subset of patients (2.9-6.25%) and although MYD88 mutation is thought to be a CLL driver mutation, its role in CLL is not clearly understood. We previously reported whole exome sequencing results from a cohort of 160 CLL patients, 10 of whom have MYD88 L265P mutation (6.25%). Eight of ten patients with MYD88 L265P mutation had mutated IGHV , consistent with prior reports of this association. However, patients with MYD88 L265P mutation did not have a younger age at diagnosis, possibly due to the overall younger median age of our patient cohort (54, range 34-77). RNA gene expression profiling of 146 CLL and 20 normal B cell samples revealed that normalized median expression of IRAK1 , IRAK4 and NFKB1 appear lower in CLL samples versus normal B cells ( IRAK1 p = 0.0001, IRAK4 p = 0.01, NFKB1 p = 0.0005). However, median expression levels of MYD88 appear higher in CLL samples versus normal B cells (p = 0.006). Although MYD88 L265P mutation has been shown to activate BTK in WM, mean BTK protein levels measured by flow cytometry were similar between CLL patients with and without MYD88 mutation (mean % cells positive for BTK, 98.3% in MYD88 L265P mutants vs. 98.16% in wild-type [WT], 3 patients/group), as were levels of phosphorylated BTK (mean % cells positive, 13.28% in MYD88 L265P vs. 14.35% in WT). Chronic BTK-mediated B cell receptor signaling is a hallmark of CLL and studies with the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib (PCI-32765) have demonstrated encouraging therapeutic results in vitro and in vivo . ND-2110 and ND-2158 are potent, highly selective IRAK4 kinase inhibitors which have single agent activity in vitro in ABC DLBCL cell lines as well as synergistic effects with BTK inhibitors. Given these findings, ND-2110 and ND-2158 were ideal candidates to test in CLL. As such, CLL samples with and without MYD88 L265P mutation (3 per group) were cultured in vitro in the presence of 5\u03bcM ND-2110 or ND-2158 as single agents or in combination with 2.5\u03bcM ibrutinib for 72 hours. A second, higher dose combination was also tested, using 25\u03bcM ND-2110 or ND-2158 and 3.75\u03bcM ibrutinib. Viability was assessed using Cell TiterGlo and normalized to DMSO treated cells. A general linear model was used to assess the association of % viability with MYD88 L265P mutation, IgM stimulation and combinations of IRAK4 inhibitor compounds and ibrutinib. MYD88 L265P was associated with higher viability, hence less cell killing (p = 0.002 5\u03bcM ND-2110 & 2.5\u03bcM ibrutinib; p < 0.0001 5\u03bcM ND-2158 & 2.5\u03bcM ibrutinib; p = 0.005 25\u03bcM ND-2158 & 3.75\u03bcM ibrutinib). Cells treated with 25\u03bcM ND-2158 + 3.75\u03bcM ibrutinib had significantly lower viability compared to cells treated with 25\u03bcM ND-2158 alone (p < 0.0001). IgM stimulation also resulted in lower viability compared to no stimulation, suggesting sensitization (p = 0.002 25\u03bcM ND-2100 + 3.75\u03bcM ibrutinib; p < 0.0001 all other combinations). Ibrutinib appeared to have less single agent activity in MYD88 L265P mutants, while the activity of single agent ND-2110 and ND-2158 was more equalized between groups. These preliminary results are currently being confirmed in additional patients. To further characterize the effects of these drugs, we have established a model system in which CLL cells are co-cultured with NIH3T3 cells expressing CD40L, with and without CpG stimulation. Preliminary results show that in one WT MYD88 CLL patient, these conditions resulted in significant induction of Ki67 expression, which was reduced by combination of either ND-2110 or 2158 with ibrutinib. These results suggest that IRAK4 inhibitors in combination with ibrutinib have interesting activity in CLL, which may differ based on MYD88 L265P mutation; experiments are in progress in additional patients to further characterize this effect.
