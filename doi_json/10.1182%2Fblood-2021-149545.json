    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The prognostic significance of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IGHV) mutational status in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is well established. Previous studies have shown that CLL patients with mutated IGHV (M-IGHV) have a better prognosis, manifested in a longer time-to first treatment (TTFT) and overall survival (OS). Here we present an analysis on the impact of IGHV mutational status in an Israeli cohort of patients with CLL. Methods: A total of 254 patients with CLL (diagnosed from 1991 to 2020), followed at the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center were included. The IGHV mutational status has been determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS) or cDNA Sanger. The sequences with a germline homology 98% or higher were considered unmutated, and those with a homology less than 98% as mutated CLL. IGHV subsets were analyzed using the ARResT/AssignSubsets website. All data were statistically analyzed by IBM SPSS Statistics 27 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA), P-values were two-sided, and the significance level was determined at a<0.05 were considered significant. Results: Out of 254 patients, 132 (52.0%) had an unmutated IGHV gene (UM-IGHV), and 122 (48.0%) were mutated (M-IGHV). At diagnosis, most patients (Table 1) were \u226465 years of age (n=157, 61.8%), males (n=160, 63.0%) and had an absolute lymphocytic count equal to or less than (\u2264)15.0 x10 9 /L (n=115, 52.5%). Advanced Binet stage was more commonly associated with UM-IGHV (n=44, 57.9%) (P=0.033). Among 240 patients (94.1%), the most frequently used VH gene segments (Figure 1) included; VH1-69 (n=35, 14.6%), VH4-34 (n=24, 10.0%), VH1-2 (n=17, 7.1%), and VH3-23 (n=16, 6.7%). Six major B-cell receptors (BCR) subsets (Figure 2) were identified in 21/180 of patients (11.7%), which most commonly included: CLL#1 (n=6, 28.6%), CLL#4 (n=5, 23.8%), and CLL#2(n=3, 14.3%). Patients with M-IGHV had a longer time to first treatment (TTFT) (P<0.001, hazard ratio (HR)=2.5, 95% confidence interval [1.8-3.5], Figure 3A) and a better overall survival (OS) (P=0.002, HR=2.7, [1.4-5.1]) compared to those with UM-IGHV gene (Figure 3B). In multivariate analyses of the entire cohort; for TTFT (Table 2A), males (P=0.002, HR=1.9, [1.3-2.9]), >65 years of age at diagnosis (P=0.008, HR=1.8, [1.2-2.7]), advanced Binet stage (P65 years of age at diagnosis (P=0.010, HR=2.6, [1.3-5.5]) and UM-IGHV mutational status (P=0.004, HR=2.9, [1.4-5.9]) were found to be significant factors for shorter OS. In multivariate analyses performed separately for each IGHV mutational status group; males (P=0.021, HR=2.1, [1.1-4.0]), age >65 years (P=0.002, HR=3.2, [1.5-6.4]) and advanced Binet stage (P65 years at diagnosis (P=0.039, HR=4.3, [1.1-17.0]) was the only independent predictor in M-IGHV patients, while no variable maintained its statistical significance in UM-IGHV cases. Conclusion: As previously studied, our cohort demonstrates that M-IGHV CLL patients have better TTFT and OS. However, the rate of BCR subsets in Israel appears to be lower than expected. A separated multivariate analysis for M-IGHV and UM-IGHV patients revealed different independent predictors for TTFT and OS to each of the IGHV mutational status groups. Further studies with larger cohorts are required to deeply study these differences and provide further clinical insight into the pathophysiology of CLL.
