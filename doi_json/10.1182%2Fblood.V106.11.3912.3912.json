    "abstract_text": "Background. Thymoglobulin\u00ae, a preparation of IgG purified from the sera of rabbits immunized with human thymocytes, is FDA approved for the treatment of transplant rejection. The perceived mechanism of action of Thymoglobulin\u00ae centers around T cell depletion which enables prolongation of graft survival. However, while Thymoglobulin\u00ae clearly effects T cell depletion, it also exhibits a portfolio of immunoregulatory activities that are not based on T cell reactivity yet contribute significantly to its efficacy. Examples include reactivities to adhesion molecules on vascular endothelial cells that inhibit T cell trafficking and to costimulatory determinants on antigen presenting cells that blunts T cell activation respectively (Bonnefoy-Berard et al., Transpl. 1991; Blood 1992; Immunol 1992; J Heart Lung Tx 1996; Rebellato, Transpl 1994; Bourdage Transpl 1995; Michallet Transpl 2003). Aims Bourdage and Hamlin (Transpl 1995) and Zand et al (ASCO, 2004) showed that Thymoglobulin\u00ae specifically binds to and induces apoptosis in human B cell lines and myeloma cells. We sought to 1) confirm and extend these findings to non-malignant human B and plasma cells and 2) identify the B cell reactive antibody specificities that reside within Thymoglobulin. Results Thymoglobulin\u00ae expresses complement independent, antibody dose dependent cytotoxicity for B cells and myeloma cells at clinically relevant Thymoglobulin\u00ae concentrations (effective Thymoglobulin\u00ae concentrations in vitro 10 - 100 mg/ml). In addition, Thymoglobulin\u00ae, at concentrations 10 \u2013 100 mg/ml, was shown to inhibit human bone marrow derived plasma cell antibody production in vitro in a complement independent manner. Visual observation of Thymoglobulin\u00ae containing bone marrow cell cultures showed cell aggregation that was antibody associated. Thymoglobulin\u00ae contains antibody reactivities that appear to be B cell selective, as it retains the B cell reactivity even after exhaustive adsorption vs. human T cell antigens. T cell depleted B cell reactive antibodies were shown to significantly inhibit constitutive IgA and IgG production from antibody producing cells within normal human bone marrow cells in vitro . The mechanism by which Thymoglobulin\u00ae kills B cells and plasma cells in vitro is unknown, but did not require addition of complement. The nature of the B cell antigens recognized by Thymoglobulin\u00ae will be discussed.",
