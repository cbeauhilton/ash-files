    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3286 Background: Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder causing oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding disorder and ceroid lipofuscinosis. Platelets from HPS patients are characterized by impaired secretion of dense (\u03b4)-bodies (CD63). Neutropenia and susceptibility to recurrent infections were exclusively observed in HPS2 patients so far. There are eight known human HPS genes ( HPS1-HPS8 ), each leading to a particular clinical HPS subtype (HPS1-HPS8). Patients/Results: The patients show a typical HPS phenotype concerning oculocutaneous albinism and bleeding symptoms. In vivo-, in vitro bleeding time and platelet aggregometry analyses revealed impaired platelet function. We identified HPS3 in two Turkish brothers and HPS2 in a girl from the United Emirates. Both brothers with HPS3 demonstrated absence of platelet \u03b4-granule secretion measured by flow cytometry analysis. A novel 1 bp-deletion in the HPS3 gene was identified in both brothers. In addition, one brother with HPS3 demonstrated psychomotoric retardation. MRI scan revealed cranial gliosis. Interestingly, array-CGH analysis revealed a 0.7 Mb deletion on chromosome 17 which had not been identified in the other brother and which seems to have caused the cranial gliosis. The girl with HPS2 suffered from life-threatening bleeding after tonsillectomy leading to severe asphyxia, resuscitation and finally, to mental retardation. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated impaired platelet \u03b4-granule secretion with a typical pattern for HPS2. CD63 expression was already increased on resting platelets, but there was only little increase after thrombin stimulation. Interestingly, only a NK-CD107 partial degranulation defect was diagnosed. So far, clinical symptoms of immunodeficiency are not obvious. Molecular genetic analyses revealed a novel 2 bp-deletion in the last exon of HPS2 leading to a frameshift and a prolonged altered protein. The location of the deletion at the very C-terminal end may prevent a complete loss of the HPS2 protein leading to a less pronounced severity of immunodeficiency as in other HPS2 patients. Conclusion: Patients with oculocutaneous albinism should be investigated for increased clinical bleeding symptoms. In case of increased bleeding symptoms, analyses of primary hemostasis should be initiated to confirm HPS. Using flow cytometry analyses HPS2 can be distinguished from the other subtypes of HPS. Molecular genetic investigations should be performed to differentiate the various subtypes of HPS which is important for therapy and prognosis. The HPS3 patient`s mental retardation seemed to be caused by an additional deletion. The identification of the molecular genetic defect helps to understand the patients` various clinical phenotypes.
