    "abstract_text": "The 5-year survival rate of patients with limited disease (LD) and aggressive histologies of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who have at least one adverse risk factor is about 70% after treatment with three cycles of CHOP followed by involved-field radiotherapy (CHOP(3) plus RT). We tested the effect of adding four infusions of rituximab to CHOP(3) plus RT in 62 evaluable patients. Patients had an aggressive histology of diffuse B-cell NHL (diffuse large cell or Burkitt\u2019s-like) and had LD. LD is defined as stage I with at least one adverse risk factor (age > 60 years, elevated serum LDH, or a performance status of 2) OR non-bulky stage II disease. Adverse risk factors are defined using a stage-modified IPI system and include: non-bulky stage II, age >60 years, elevated serum LDH and a performance status of 2. Patients with bulky stage II disease were excluded as their prognosis is similar to advanced disease, and patients with stage I disease and no risk factors were excluded as their prognosis exceeds 90% survival at 10 years with CHOP(3) plus RT. Rituximab was infused at 375 mg/m2 on days \u22127, 1, 22, and 43, and CHOP was given at standard doses on days 3, 24, and 45 (CHOP(3) plus R plus RT). Involved-field RT was given as previously described ( N Engl J Med  1998 ; 339 : 21 \u201326 ). With a median follow-up of 2.4 years, the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) measured at 2 years was 94% and 95%, respectively. In order to estimate whether the addition of rituximab adds benefit to CHOP(3) plus RT, and therefore, would be worth testing in a comparative trial, we identified 68 patients from SWOG study 8736 treated with CHOP(3) plus RT using the same criteria to include LD and aggressive diffuse B-cell histologies. These previously reported patients treated with CHOP(3) plus RT (ref above) have a median follow-up of 12.0 years. The PFS and OS for this group measured at 2 years was 85% and 93%, respectively. Four patients have relapsed in the rituximab-treated group and 10 patients had relapsed in the CHOP(3) plus RT alone treated group within the first 2 years. Three patients have died in the rituximab- treated group and five patients had died on the CHOP(3) plus RT alone treated group within the first 2 years (see Table). Short-term toxicity appeared similar. We conclude that the addition of rituximab to standard treatment with CHOP(3) plus RT results in outcome which compares favorably to our historical experience and merits further study.
