    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4988 To date, multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable malignancy of antibody-producing clonal plasma cells. The introduction of a new generation of immunomodulatory agents, such as lenalidomide (LEN), and the potent proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BORT), used alone or in combination with steroids (dexamethasone; DEX or prednisone; PRED) has significantly improved the overall survival of MM patients. Nonetheless, all chemotherapy strategies are eventually hampered by the development of drug-resistance. Towards a novel and effective targeted immunotherapy for MM, we have developed daratumumab (DARA), a CD38 human antibody with broad-spectrum killing activity. In vitro, DARA induces substantial anti-MM effects mainly via ADCC (antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity) and CDC (complement dependent cytotoxicity). In ex vivo assays, which allowed us to address killing of MM cells in bone marrow aspirates isolated from MM patients, enhanced or even synergistic MM cell killing was observed when DARA was combined with LEN, or with cocktails of LEN/BORT/DEX and melphalan/BORT/DEX. We now extended these ex vivo analyses to evaluate whether DARA in combination with LEN, BORT and DEX could improve the lysis of MM cells in bone marrow aspirates derived from 22 patients of whom 9 became refractory for LEN and 6 for LEN and BORT. DARA significantly enhanced the lysis of MM cells when combined with LEN or BORT in virtually all patients, including the LEN- and LEN/BORT-refractory patients. The combination of DARA+BORT and DARA+DEX induced additive killing, suggestive of lysis by independent mechanisms. When combined with LEN, DARA improved the lysis of MM cells in a synergistic manner in both non-refractory and LEN-refractory patients. This is suggestive of killing by at least partly complementary mechanisms. Synergistic activity of LEN and DARA was attributable to LEN-induced activation of effector cells that were involved in DARA-mediated ADCC. In addition, enhanced/synergistic direct killing of MM cells was observed. Experiments are under way to further investigate the mechanism underlying synergistic activity of DARA and LEN. In conclusion, our results provide a rationale for clinical evaluation of DARA in combination with LEN, BORT and DEX including in patients refractory to these drugs.
