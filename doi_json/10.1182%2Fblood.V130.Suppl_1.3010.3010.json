    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Recent data suggests that PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1/PD-L2 mediate immune evasion in CLL. However, recent work (Ding, BLOOD 2017) demonstrates that pembrolizumab (pembro) alone is ineffective in patients (pts) with CLL (ORR 0%, median PFS 2.4 months). In 5 pts with relapsed/refractory (r/r) CLL, 3 responded to the combination of ibrutinib / nivolumab (Jain ASH, 2016). A key interaction exists between PI3K signaling and immune checkpoint surveillance by which inhibition of PI3K decreases PD-L1 tumor expression. Thus, we hypothesized synergistic activity with PD-1 + P13K blockade. We tested the safety and activity of umbralisib, a next generation, highly-specific PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor, in combination with pembro and the glycoengineered anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ublituximab in r/r CLL, representing the first reported combination of a PD-1 inhibitor with a PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor. Methods: This is a Ph I (3+3 design), multicenter study to assess the safety of pembro in combination with umbralisib and ublituximab in pts with r/r CLL. Treatment involved three stages: Eligible pts received umbralisib (800mg daily) and ublituximab (900mg 3 out of 4 weeks) for the first two cycles (Induction). Pembro (dose level 1=100mg, dose level 2=200mg) was then initiated every 3 wks in combination with umbralisib daily and ublituximab (900mg week 2 of cycle 4 and 6) for cycles 3-6 (Consolidation). Upon completion of cycle 6, pts continue umbralisib 800 mg daily until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity (Maintenance). The primary endpoint is safety of pembro, umbralisib, and ublituximab; efficacy is a secondary endpoint. Response assessments are based on the iwCLL 2008 criteria and performed after umbralisib + ublituximab (2 mos), umbralisib, ublituximab, pembro (6 mos) and during maintenance with umbralisib at month 12. Peripheral blood and/or bone marrow biopsy were obtained for correlative analyses at screening, month 2 and month 6. For correlative analysis, mononuclear cells were enriched and cryopreserved. Cryopreserved cells were subjected to multicolor immunophenotyping to analyze: B cells (CD5, CD38, CD3, HLA-DR, CD19, PDL2, CD27, PDL1 and viability) and T/NK cells (CD8, CD56, CCCR7, CD3, CD4, IgG4, CD19, TIM-3, CD25, PD1 and viability). Results: Ten pts were initially treated: 9 with CLL (3 on the 100 mg pembro cohort and 6 in the 200 mg pembro cohort) and 1 with Richter's Transformation (100 mg pembro cohort). Herein we report on the 9 CLL pts who were evaluable for safety and efficacy. Baseline demographics were as follows: male/female (5/4), median age 71 years (range 60-81), median prior therapies 1 (1-3), 78% refractory. 56% were treated with a BTK inhibitor (ibrutinib or acalabrutinib) prior to study enrollment, all of which were refractory to BTK therapy. 78% had at least 1 high risk genetic feature (del17p, del11q, TP53 mut, Notch1 mut or complex karyotype). All grade and grade \u2265 3 AEs during cycles 3-6 (umbralisib, ublituximab, and pembro combination) are listed in Table 1 . Of note, only 1 DLT occurred (ALT/AST elevation - 200 mg pembro cohort) which trigged expansion to 6 pts, with no additional DLTs reported. The MTD was not reached and therefore the primary study endpoint was met. We did not observe an increase in expected grade \u2265 3 PI3K\u03b4-associated toxicities including pneumonitis, colitis, and transaminitis (1 event). ORR was 75% for the non-BTK refractory pts (3/4) and 60% in BTK refractory pts (3/5). At the time of this analysis, only 1 pt experienced PD and no deaths were observed ( Figure 1 ). Eight of nine pts remain on study in follow up (range 4 - 21+ mos). Of note, patient 1 elected not to participate in the maintenance phase and has achieved an ongoing 21+ month PFS without therapy. Figure 2 includes the swimmers plot for all 9 CLL study pts. Four pts have had detailed correlative analyses. In one pt, there was a 20-fold increase in bone marrow CLL cells expressing PD-L1 /PD-L2 post treatment with pembro. The proportions of the major T cell subsets (including Tregs) and PD1 levels did not change appreciably during therapy. Conclusion : These are the first data of a PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor in combination with anti PD-1 therapy in CLL. The triplet combination of umbralisib + ublituximab + pembro was well-tolerated with durable responses in pts refractory to BTK inhibitor therapy. Enrollment is ongoing in both the CLL and Richter's Transformation cohorts. Correlative analyses for all subjects will be reported.
