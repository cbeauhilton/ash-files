    "abstract_text": "Background: Type 3 is the most severe form of von Willebrand disease (VWD) caused by the virtual absence of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in affected patients. The prevalence of type 3 VWD in Hungary is 2.6 per million. Capitalizing on a nationwide National Bleeding Disorder Registry, we designed a study to characterize the genetic background of the entire Hungarian type 3 VWD population. The current report focuses on the molecular characterization of a novel large deletion. Methods: 24 patients from 23 unrelated families were studied by direct sequencing of the 52 exons of the VWF gene. The breakpoints of a large deletion were characterized by standard gene mapping. Breakpoint-specific PCR was used to confirm the presence of the deletion, and to screen for identical deletions in other populations from Germany, Russia, and Poland. Results: A large partial deletion (delExon1-3) of the 5\u2032-region of the VWF gene was detected in 10 alleles (19 percent of all type 3 mutations). Five patients from 4 unrelated families were homozygous, and 2 patients were heterozygous for the deletion. Consanguinity was known in one of the families. In comparison, 2435 delC in exon 18, a common cause of type 3 VWD in some European populations, was found on 6 alleles (12 percent; one patient homozygous). The large deletion resulted in the loss of a 35 kb fragment, incorporating exons 1, 2 and 3. The 5\u2032 breakpoint is located in the 5\u2032 untranslated region, while the 3\u2032 breakpoint is in intron 3 of VWF. No other known gene is lost with the deletion. Clinically, all homozygous patients had serious bleeding episodes from infancy requiring frequent VWF substitutions. However, bleeding became much milder in all patients with no significant spontaneous bleeding after the age of 3-5 years. No inhibitor to VWF was detected. delExon1-3 was not detected in any of the other screened populations. Conclusion: We report a large novel deletion including exons 1, 2 and 3 of VWF commonly causing type 3 VWD in the Hungarian population. This mutation, which is most probably due to a founder effect, seems to be unique to Hungarian patients with a high allele frequency. Together, delExon1-3 and 2435delC make up 31 % of genetic defects in Hungarian patients with VWD type 3. This offers a rational approach to molecular testing of respective families in Hungary.",
