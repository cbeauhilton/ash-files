    "abstract_text": "Malignant cells that infiltrate the bone marrow (BM) interfere with the normal cellular behavior of supporting cells, thereby creating an alternative malignant niche. This intercellular communication is mostly mediated by cytokines and their receptors. In this study, we find that expression of the CXCR4 receptor is significantly increased in pediatric precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cells compared with normal mononuclear hematopoietic cells derived of the bone marrow (p=0.016). Furthermore, we show that high CXCR4 expression is correlated with an unfavorable clinical outcome in BCP-ALL (5-yr CIR \u00b1SE: 38.4% \u00b16.9% in CXCR4-high versus 12.0% \u00b14.6% in CXCR4-low expressing patients, p<0.001). Interestingly, BM serum levels of the CXCR4 ligand (CXCL12) are 2.7-fold lower (p=0.005) in samples taken at initial diagnosis of BCP-ALL compared with the levels in samples taken of non-leukemic controls. We show that induction chemotherapy restores CXCL12 levels in the BM to normal levels. Blocking the CXCR4 receptor with Plerixafor (FDA-approved drug) showed that the lower CXCL12 serum levels at initial diagnosis could not be explained by consumption by the leukemic cells, nor did we observe an altered CXCL12-production capacity of BM-MSC at this time-point. We rather observed that a very high density of leukemic cells negatively affected CXCL12 production by the BM-MSC while stimulating the secretion levels of G-CSF. These results suggest that highly proliferative leukemic cells are able to down-regulate the production of cytokines involved in homing (CXCL12), while simultaneously up-regulating the production of cytokines involved in hematopoietic mobilization (G-CSF). This disbalance may stimulate the spreading of BCP-ALL outside the BM. The data presented here suggest that interference with the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis (for instance by using Plerixafor) may be an effective way to mobilize BCP-ALL cells; the more ALL cells become mobilized, the less ALL cells may escape from combination chemotherapy. In proof-of concept studies, this hypothesis needs to be validated to pave the way for implementation in future treatment protocols for children with ALL.
