    "abstract_text": "Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp\u00ae) administered at 300 mcg Q3W appears to be an effective dose in patients with hemoglobin (Hb) 10\u201312 g/dL to maintain Hb, and in patients with Hb 8\u201310 g/dL to elevate Hb to within the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-recommended target range of 11\u201312 g/dL. The objective of this multicenter, open-label study of cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia was to evaluate the effectiveness of darbepoetin alfa 300 mcg Q3W, administered over a 16 week treatment period, in achieving and maintaining the therapeutic objectives of anemia treatment consistent with NCCN guidelines. This objective was assessed by determining the percentage of patients who achieved a post baseline target Hb level \u226511.0 g/dL in the absence of a transfusion within the previous 28 days, and the percentage of patients maintaining an average Hb within the NCCN target range. Secondary hematologic endpoints included the incidence of transfusion and the proportion of patients achieving a hematopoietic response (increase in Hb \u22652 g/dL from baseline or achieving a Hb \u226512 g/dL). Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the FACT-Fatigue subscale with four additional questions relating to fatigue, energy, activity, and overall health. The relationship between clinical endpoints and the ability to achieve and maintain Hb within the NCCN target range were also assessed. Anemic patients (baseline Hb levels < 11 g/dL) with nonmyeloid malignancies receiving chemotherapy were eligible for enrollment in this study. Doses could be escalated after 6 weeks (2 doses) to 500 mcg Q3W if Hb levels remained < 10 g/dL and the increase in Hb from baseline was < 1 g/dL, or, based on physician discretion if Hb levels were > 10g/dL. To date, 539 patients have been enrolled. The majority of patients were female (59%), white (82%) with a median age of 64 years. The predominant cancers in these patients were lung (24%), gastrointestinal (22%), and breast (21%). The majority of patients had stage IV disease (45%) and a Karnofsky performance status score of 80 to 90 (65%). The mean (SD) baseline Hb level was 10.1 g/dL (0.7); 32% of patients had a baseline Hb of < 10.0 g/dL [mean (SD) Hb 9.3 (0.6) g/dL] while 66% had baseline Hb levels \u226510.0 g/dL [10.6 (0.3) g/dL]; 2% of patients (n = 12) received a transfusion within 28 days of baseline Hb measurement and were excluded from analysis. Since the majority of chemotherapy regimens are delivered on a Q3W basis, the ability to administer darbepoetin alfa at a fixed dose, synchronized with the chemotherapy schedule may reduce the number of injection-centric visits. This provides important benefits for patients and their caregivers, and represents a simplification in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in oncology practice.",
