    "abstract_text": "In severely lymphopenic hosts, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations increase rapidly through peripheral homeostatic expansion, a process in which IL-7 has been found to play a key role. Because of the marked differences in the kinetics of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell repopulation following hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT), we have investigated the roles of additional cytokines in early repopulation. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) supports the proliferation, terminal differentiation, and survival of NK, NKT and memory CD8+ T-cell populations, all of which increase disproportionately in the early transplant period. We therefore investigated the role of IL-15 in post-transplant CD8+ T cell recovery by assessing plasma IL-15 levels, IL-15 receptor expression and IL-15-induced proliferation by BrdU incorporation. In patients undergoing non-myeloablative HLA-matched allogeneic HSCT for hematological and non-hematological malignancies, IL-15 levels in the plasma increased concurrent with the loss of lymphocytes during each cycle of inductive chemotherapy, and peaked at a 50-fold increase over pretreatment levels at day of transplant, a time when CD8+ T cell levels were usually less than 1 cell/\u03bcL. Plasma IL-15 levels fell rapidly in the first two weeks, during the rapid recovery of NK and CD8+ T cell populations, returning to pretransplant levels by 1\u20132 months. Overall, during the cytoreductive transplant and for the first year post transplant, the IL-15 levels were inversely proportional to the level of CD8 T cells (P < 0.0001; r = \u22120.73). In the first weeks after transplant, CD8+T-cells expressed elevated levels of CD122, but had little or no expression of CD25, the IL-2Ralpha chain. Levels of CD122 remained elevated for several months, while expression of CD127, IL-7Ralpha, was reduced. In vitro BrdU incorporation assays demonstrated that CD8+ T-cells from both normal donors and transplant recipients responded primarily to IL-15, not IL-7 or IL-2. CD4+ T cells, in contrast, responded primarily to IL-7. A higher proportion of CD28+CD45RA\u2212 memory and CD28\u2212CD45RA+/\u2212 effector-memory CD8+ T-cells incorporated BrdU than did naive CD28+CD45RA+ CD8+ T cells. Finally, IL-15, not IL-2 or IL-7, was found to maintain survival and support expansion in culture of the CD28\u2212CD57+ terminal effector cells that dominate post transplant CD8+ T-cells populations. These data, describing an inverse relationship between the levels of free plasma IL-15 and CD8+ T cells, elevated expression of IL-15 receptor chain and strong responsiveness of post transplant CD8+ T cells to IL-15, suggest that IL-15 serves as a critical homeostatic cytokine post transplant, supporting the initial rapid generation CD8+ T cells and maintaining elevated levels of memory/effector CD8+ T-cell populations in the post transplant period.",
