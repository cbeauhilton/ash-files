    "abstract_text": "Background: Induction chemotherapy (7+3) or high-dose ara-C-based (HIDAC) for AML results in prolonged neutropenia with a high risk of serious infection and attendant morbidity, and prolonged hospitalization. Romyelocel-L is a human off-the-shelf allogeneic myeloid progenitor cell (MPC) preparation manufactured by ex vivo culture expansion of CD34+ cells. Following infusion, MPCs are expected to home to bone marrow (BM) and produce neutrophils. In a randomized, open-label, controlled Phase 2 trial, the effect of romyelocel-L was studied in de novo patients receiving HIDAC or 7+3 induction therapy for reduction of fever and infection. The results from pooled and 7+3 cohorts, were previously presented, showing decrease in infections and days in hospital. The results from cohorts receiving HIDAC chemotherapy are presented here. Methods: 53 subjects with de novo AML (age \u226555) and receiving HIDAC induction were randomized on Day 0 (first day of induction) to receive either romyelocel-L (7.5x10 6 cells/kg) on Day 9 + GCSF qd starting on Day 14 (treatment) or GCSF alone starting on Day 14 (control) qd until ANC recovery to 500/\u00b5L. Of the 53 subjects, 42 were considered evaluable (20 in treatment and 22 in control) which meant that they received romyelocel-L + GCSF or GCSF alone, were in study \u2265 28 days and did not receive additional chemotherapy before Day 28. Subjects routinely received corticosteroids concurrently with HIDAC induction. Most patients received prophylactic antibacterial (74%) and antifungal (86%) agents. Endpoints assessed from Day 9 to Day 28 included days in a Febrile Episode (DFE, primary endpoint) and microbiologically defined bacterial or fungal infections (MDI, defined as an infection when a specific pathogen is identified)/clinically diagnosed infections (CDI, defined when there is supporting clinical, laboratory, and/or radiologic data that is sufficient to indicate an infection and no specific pathogen is identified). MDIs and CDIs were adjudicated by a blinded independent committee. The number of days in hospital was assessed through Day 42. Data are reported for 2 periods: from infusion of romyelocel-L (Day 9-28) and from 6 days after infusion of romyelocel-L (1 day after start of GCSF) - Day 28 (denoted as Day 15-28; the period when romyelocel-L derived neutrophils are likely to be circulating.). One-sided p-values are reported. Results: The baseline characteristics, including median age, mean WBC, and ECOG status were balanced between the treatment and control groups. The mean DFE during Day 9-28 in the treatment and control was 6.00 and 4.04 days respectively. Absence of fever was seen in 0/20 and 9/22 (40.9%) in the treatment and control group, respectively. The mean DFE for Day 15-28 was 1.37 and 2.98 days in the treatment vs. control respectively. The incidence of MDI or CDI during Day 9-28 was 40% vs 41% in the treatment vs. control, however a significant decrease was observed during Day 15-28 with incidence of 5% vs 27.3% in the treatment vs control (p=0.027). The use of prophylactic antimicrobial agents was similar between study arms. Mean number of days in hospital were 22.6 vs 25.7 days in treatment vs. control groups (p=0.027). The median number of days to ANC recovery of 500/\u00b5l was 19.5 vs 21.5 days in treatment vs control (p=0.103). Remission rates were similar in the two groups. All seven subjects assessed for chimerism had romyelocel-L cells detected in peripheral blood (PB) on the day of infusion. Post infusion, chimerism was observed in 6/7 subjects in one or more of BM, peripheral blood and gingival rinse samples. No deaths were observed in either of the two arms within the first 42 days. Romyelocel-L was generally tolerated well. Summary/Conclusion: The incidence of infections was decreased during the day 15-28 period and a decrease of three days in hospital stay was observed in de novo HIDAC AML subjects receiving romyelocel-L. Romyelocel-L may provide a new option to reduce infections in AML patients undergoing HIDAC induction therapy.
