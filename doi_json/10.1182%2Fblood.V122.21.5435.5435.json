    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), alone or followed by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), is a potentially curative treatment for various hematological malignancies. In an HLA-matched transplantation setting, the therapeutic graft-versus-tumor (GvT) effect is mediated by donor T-cells directed at minor histocompatibility antigens (mHags), which are HLA-bound polymorphic peptides. Unfortunately, most patients don\u2019t achieve complete response or relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and thus still require additional therapies. Immunotherapy aimed at hematopoietically restricted mHags could theoretically provide an ideal method to augment the GvT effect, without causing GvHD. The most relevant mHags for immunotherapy are those antigens that are only expressed on hematopoietic tissue, are presented by frequent HLA molecules and display an equally balanced population frequency. UTA2-1 and HA-1 are two of these most broadly applicable mHags identified up until now and are therefore included in on-going clinical trials of mHag-peptide loaded dendritic cell vaccination in patients with various hematological malignancies. Another method for mHag-based immunotherapy could be adoptive transfer of ex vivo cultured mHag-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). However, initial results of both methods, also from preclinical models and trials in patients with solid tumors, postulate the necessity for improved strategies for efficient ex vivo and in vivo induction of tumour specific CTLs. We here show for the HLA-A*02 restricted epitopes UTA2-1 and HA-1 that their MHC binding and consequent T cell reactivity can be improved through the incorporation of certain newly designed non-proteogenic amino acids at crucial MHC anchoring positions. With this novel approach we designed superior altered peptide ligands (APLs) for both epitopes, of which the best modifications not only increased MHC binding and stability, but also improved recognition by antigen specific T cells. Most importantly, these optimised peptides gave rise to superior antitumor T cell responses in vitro and in vivo in comparison to the native epitope, as they induced significantly enhanced proliferation of peptide-specific T cells with retained cytotoxic potential against malignant targets expressing the natural UTA2-1 antigen. Hence, these APLs designed with non-proteogenic amino acids with enhanced MHC-affinity and immunogenicity may improve the therapeutic outcome of mHag-based vaccination strategies, or can be utilized for ex vivo antigen-specific T cell enrichment and expansion for transfer into patients with haematological malignancies.
