    "abstract_text": "Backround: Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been shown to be synergistic with melphalan both in vitro and in vivo. We conducted a phase I/II trial to determine the safety and efficacy of a combination of arsenic trioxide, melphalan and ascorbic acid (AA) as preparative regimen in patients undergoing high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation for multiple myeloma (MM). We also assessed the impact ATO levels on melphalan pharmacokinetics (PK), engraftment and toxicity. Methods: Forty-eight patients with secretory myeloma (23 females, 25 males; median age: 54, range: 3570) were treated between 4/04 and 8/05. All patient received melphalan 100 mg/m 2 IV on days -4 and -3 and AA 1000 mg/day IV on days -9 to -3. Patients were randomized to 3 arms; no ATO (arm 1), ATO 0.15 mg/kg IV on days -9 to -3 (arm 2) and ATO 0.25 mg/kg IV on days -9 to -3 (arm 3). Twelve patients had disease progression or relapse after a prior autograft. Median CD34 cells dose infused was 4.5 x 10 6 /kg (range 2.3\u201310.9). Results: Patients in all 3 arms were evenly matched. With a median F/U of 14.0 months (range 6\u201325) post autograft, no dose-limiting toxicity or non-relapse mortality was seen. Toxicity was limited to grade I or II nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Median ATO levels on day 0 in arms 1, 2 and 3 were 0.2, 26.3 and 46.2 ng/ml, respectively. Melphalan PK was not altered by ATO pretreatment. Median time to neutrophil engraftment (ANC >500/ dl) was 9 days. There were no engraftment failures or delays in the ATO arms. CR rate for the entire group was 23%, and total response rate (CR + PR) was 75%. 1-year Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 75% and 95%, respectively. There was no significant difference in CR, RR, PFS or OS between the 3 arms (p = 0.9, 0.9, 0.4 and 0.6, respectively). A prior autologous transplant (p = 0.02) and abnormal cytogenetics at transplant (p = 0.04) were associated with a significantly shorter remission. Conclusions: ATO + melphalan + ascorbic acid is a safe, effective and well tolerated preparative regimen for patients with multiple myeloma undergoing an autotransplant. A longer follow up is needed to assess the impact of ATO on progression-free and overall survival.",
