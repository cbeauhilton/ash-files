    "abstract_text": "Introduction: 2nd generation CD19 CAR T cells show unprecedented efficacy in B-ALL, but several challenges remain: (1) scaling manufacture to meet patient need and (2) feasibility of generating products from lymphopenic patients post allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). To overcome these issues we propose: (1) use of the CliniMACS Prodigy (Miltenyi Biotec), a semi-automated cGMP platform that simplifies CAR T cell manufacture and (2) the use of matched donor T cells to overcome the challenge posed by patient lymphopenia, albeit this may come with a heightened risk of graft versus host disease (GvHD). CARD (NCT02893189) is a Phase I study of matched donor derived CD19 CAR T cells generated on the CliniMACS Prodigy in 14 adult patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B ALL following allo-SCT. We additionally explore the requirement for lymphodepletion (LD) in the allogeneic CAR T cell setting and report on the incidence of GvHD with this therapy. Methods: Manufacturing: CARD utilises non-mobilised matched donor leucapheresate to manufacture 2 nd generation CD19CAR T cells using a closed CliniMACS\u00ae Prodigy/ TransACT TM process. Study design: Eligible subjects are aged 16-70y with r/r B ALL following allo SCT. Study endpoints include feasibility of CD19CAR T cell manufacture from allo-SCT donors on the CliniMACS Prodigy and assessments of engraftment and safety including GvHD. To assess the requirement for LD prior to CD19CAR T cells in lymphopenic post-allo-SCT patients, the study is split into Cohort 1 (no LD) and Cohort 2 (fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 x3) and cyclophosphamide (300mg/m 2 x3)). To mitigate for the potential GvHD risk, cell dosing on study mirrors conventional donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) schedules and is based on total CD3+ (not CAR T) cell numbers: Dose 1=1x10 6 /kg CD3+ T cells; Dose 2= 3x10 6 /kg CD3+ T cells; Dose 3= 1x10 7 /kg CD3+ T cells. Results: As of 26 July 2019, 17 matched allo SCT donors were leukapheresed and 16 products were successfully manufactured and QP released. Patient demographics are as follows: (1) median patient age was 43y (range 19-64y); (2) 4/17 had prior blinatumomab and 5/17 prior inotuzumab ozogamicin; (3) 7/17 had myeloablative allo SCT and 10/17 reduced intensity allo SCT of which 6/17 were sibling donors and 12/17 were matched unrelated donors. No patients with haploidentical transplant were enrolled. To date, 12/16 patients have received at least 1 dose of CD19CAR T cells: 7/16 on Cohort 1 and 5/16 on Cohort 2 (2/16 are pending infusion on Cohort 2 and 2/16 died of fungal infection prior to infusion). Median follow-up for all 12 patients is 22.9 months (IQR 2.9-25.9; range 0.7 - 25.9). At the time of CAR T cell infusion, 7/12 patients were in morphological relapse with >5% leukemic blasts. Despite this, CD19CAR T cells were administered safely: only 2/12 patients experienced Grade 3 CRS (UPenn criteria), both in Cohort 1, which fully resolved with Tocilizumab and corticosteroids. No patients experienced \u2265Grade 3 neurotoxicity and importantly, no patients experienced clinically significant GvHD. In Cohort 1 (7 patients), median peak CAR expansion by flow was 87 CD19CAR/uL blood whereas in Cohort 2 (5 patients to date), median peak CAR expansion was 1309 CD19CAR/uL blood. This difference is likely to reflect the use of LD in Cohort 2. CAR T cell persistence by qPCR in Cohort 1 is short, with demonstrable CAR in only 2/7 treated patients at Month 2. Data for Cohort 2 is immature, but this will also be reported at the meeting in addition to potential mechanisms underlying the short persistence observed in Cohort 1. Of the 10 response evaluable patients (2/12 pending marrow assessment), 9/10 (90%) achieved flow/molecular MRD negative CR at 6 weeks. 2/9 responders experienced CD19 negative relapse (one at M3, one at M5) and 3/9 responders experienced CD19+ relapse (one at M3, one at M9, one at M12). 4/10 (40%) response evaluable patients remain on study and continue in flow/molecular MRD negative remission at a median follow up of 11.9 months (range 2.9-25.9). Conclusions: Donor-derived matched allogeneic CD19 CAR T cells are straightforward to manufacture using the CliniMACS Prodigy and deliver excellent early remission rates, with 90% MRD negative CR observed at Week 6 in the absence of severe CAR associated toxicity or GvHD. Peak CAR expansion appears to be compromised by the absence of LD and this may lead to a higher relapse rate. Updated results from Cohorts 1 and 2 will be presented.
