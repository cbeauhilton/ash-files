    "abstract_text": "Introduction . Results from St. Jude and M. D. Anderson, USA, suggested that AML children < 10 years have significantly better outcome than patients aged 10\u201321 years. Similarly, the Medical Research Council, UK, showed superior survival in children < 10 years due to a lower relapse rate compared to 10 \u2013 15 year olds. We describe the AML outcome by age in the Nordic countries. Patients . Within the population based NOPHO AML protocols (NOPHO-AML 93 and NOPHO-AML 2004) we treated 403 patients aged 0 \u2013 18 years from 1993 \u2013 2007. Patients with Down syndrome and AML-M3 were excluded. The children were divided into three age groups; 0 \u20131 year (27%), 2 \u20139 years (41%) and 10+ years (32%). The oldest age group had a male preponderance. MLL-aberrations were more common among the youngest and t(8;21) among the oldest. FAB-type M5 was seen in 35% of 0\u20131 year olds versus only in 16% of children aged 10+.  . 0 \u2013 1 year\u2028 n= 109 . 2 \u20139 years\u2028 n = 165 . 10 \u2013 18 years\u2028 n = 129 . .

Almost half of the patients experienced events during follow-up.

Older children are more often male, more frequently have t(8;21) and less often M5-subtype or MLL-aberrations. The OS and EFS are similar among all ages. However, older children more often have resistant disease. The risk of death during induction and relapse is similar."
