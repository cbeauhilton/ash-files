    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1033 Osteonecrosis is a debilitating corticosteroid-induced toxicity in patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Our goal was to ascertain genetic and non-genetic risk factors for this complication. In St. Jude Total XV protocol for children with newly diagnosed ALL, we prospectively screened 365 patients with magnetic resonance imaging of hips and knees, irrespective of symptoms. We determined whether age, race, sex, ALL treatment arm, body mass index, serum lipids, albumin and cortisol levels, dexamethasone pharmacokinetics and genome-wide germline genetic polymorphisms were associated with symptomatic (grade 2\u20134) osteonecrosis. Sixty-eight patients developed symptomatic osteonecrosis with a cumulative incidence of 17%. Age greater than 10 years (odds ratio 4.8; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2.5\u20139.2; p = 0.00001) and treatment arm (standard/high risk vs. low risk) (odds ratio 2.5; 95% CI 1.2\u20134.9; p = 0.011) were associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis, and were included as covariates in all other analyses. Lower serum albumin (p = 0.04) and higher serum cholesterol levels (p = 0.02) were associated with symptomatic (grade 2\u20134) osteonecrosis. In addition, higher dexamethasone plasma exposure (area-under-the-curve) was associated with severe (grade 3\u20134) osteonecrosis (p = 0.0007). After adjusting for clinical features (age and treatment arm), we identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of developing osteonecrosis. These include: ACP1 (rs12714403, p = 1.03 \u00d7 10 -5 ; odds ratio 4.8; 95% CI 2.4\u20139.6), a gene involved in regulation of lipids and osteoblast differentiation; and SH3YL1 (rs4241316, p = 5.7 \u00d7 10 -6 ; odds ratio 5.0; 95% CI 2.5\u201310.1). These SNPs were also associated with lower albumin and elevated serum cholesterol levels. In conclusion, older age, lower albumin levels, increased dexamethasone systemic exposure, and higher cholesterol levels were associated with osteonecrosis. Inherited genomic variation that predisposes to osteonecrosis may do so via pleiotropic effects on dexamethasone pharmacokinetics, serum cholesterol and serum albumin.
