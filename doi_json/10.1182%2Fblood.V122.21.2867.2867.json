    "abstract_text": "Background Approximately 2-8% patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) will transform to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, Richter syndrome [RS]). Clinical characteristics and molecular markers at the time of CLL diagnosis are associated with the risk of RS; however, there are no data regarding germline genetic variations and the risk of RS. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have shown several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with a higher risk of familial CLL. It is not known whether any of these polymorphisms also predispose to RS. Methods Since 2002, all consecutive patients with newly diagnosed (<9 months diagnosis) CLL at Mayo Clinic were offered enrollment into a prospective genetic epidemiology study. Patients completed extensive epidemiologic questionnaires and baseline clinical, laboratory, and biologic data were abstracted using a standard protocol. Genotyping of germline tissue at diagnosis was performed using an Illumina iSelect panel and Affymetrix 6.0 SNP chip. All patients were prospectively and longitudinally followed at defined time-points with systematic collection of data on treatments, second cancers, and RS. All patients with biopsy-proven DLBCL during follow-up were considered to have undergone transformation into RS. Time to RS was calculated from CLL diagnosis date until RS or until last follow-up date for those with no RS. SNPs were modeled in two ways: ordinal and dominant. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) for individual SNPs with time to transformation. Results Thirteen of the GWAS-discovered SNPs associated with risk of developing CLL were available and genotyped on 620 CLL patients. Median age at diagnosis of CLL was 62 years (range 27-88), and 428 (69%) were male. Three hundred and ten (51%) patients were low (0) Rai stage, 271 (45%) were intermediate (I-II) Rai stage, and 22 (4%) were advanced (III-IV) Rai stage. The immunoglobulin heavy chain gene was unmutated in 189 (40%) patients; 157 (32%) patients expressed ZAP-70, 163 (29%) expressed CD38 and 104 (31%) expressed CD49d. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that 210 (41%) patients had del13q, 90 (18%) patients had trisomy 12, 37 (7%) had del11q, 23 (5%) had del17p and 141 (28%) had no detectable FISH abnormalities. As of last follow-up, 239 (39%) patients received therapy for CLL. After a median follow-up of 5.9 years (range 0-11), 15 (2.4%) patients developed biopsy-proven RS. The median time to RS in these 15 patients was 4.5 years (range 1.0-8.7 years). The ordinal HR for the 13 SNPs tested, their corresponding genes, and p-values are shown in Table 1 . Germline polymorphisms in a single SNP, rs4987852, encoding for BCL2 (chromosome 18), was significantly associated with an increased risk of RS (ordinal HR=3.9; 95% CI=1.6-9.8; p-value=0.004). This allele was present in 48/605 (8%) non-transformed CLL patients compared to 4/15 (27%) of patients with RS. Time to RS according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis for rs4987852 is shown in Figure 1 . This SNP is located in a region in which t(14;18) translocation breakpoints commonly occur in follicular lymphoma and overexpression of BCL2 leads to an increased incidence of B-cell lymphomas in mice.

Specifically, SNP (rs4987852) present on the BCL2 gene on chromosome 18 in CLL is associated with an increased risk of transformation to RS. These observations require replication in other CLL cohorts.
