    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Large population studies have revealed that higher levels of von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and lower levels of ADAMTS13 activity (ADAMTS13) are associated with a risk of thrombosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship among the plasma levels of VWF, ADAMTS13 and the occurrence of cerebral infarction in patients. Methods: In a case-control study of 94 cerebral infarction patients (CIP) and 103 age-matched healthy controls (Control), the plasma levels of VWF antigen (VWF:Ag ), VWF ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:Rcof), and VWF collagen binding activity (VWF:CB) were measured using ELISA. ADAMTS13 activity (ADAMTS13) was measured with FREST-VWF73. The study was approved by the institutional Ethics Committee at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, China. All participants were given write informed consents. Results: The levels of VWF:Ag and VWF:Rcof in cerebral infraction patients (mean\u00b1SEM, 223\u00b115% and 256\u00b120%) were significantly higher compared with controls (117\u00b18% and 128\u00b19%). Levels of ADAMTS13 and ratios of VWF:CB/VWF:Ag, ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag and ADAMTS13/VWF:Rcof in patients (107\u00b14%, 0.73\u00b10.08, 0.76\u00b10.07 and 0.86\u00b10.10, respectively) were significantly lower compared with controls (125\u00b13%, 1.37\u00b10.08, 1.69\u00b10.14 and 1.45\u00b10.10, P0.05). Unconditional logistic regression analysis demonstrated the highest quartile of VWF:Ag (odds ratio [OR] = 5.11, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-17.50), VWF:Rcof (OR = 5.04, 95% CI, 1.62-15.66), and the lowest quartile of VWF:CB/VWF:Ag (OR = 5.91, 95% CI, 1.95-17.93), ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag (OR = 9.11, 95% CI, 2.49-33.33), ADAMTS13/VWF:Rcof (OR = 3.73, 95% CI, 1.39-10.03) were associated with cerebral infarction (P 0.7). Conclusions: High levels of VWF:Ag, VWF:Rcof and lower levels of VWF:CB/VWF:Ag, ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag, ADAMTS13/VWF:Rcof are relative risk factors. The threshold of VWF:Ag ( > 137.88%), VWF:Rcof ( > 135.88%), VWF:CB/VWF:Ag ( \u2264 0.538), ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ( \u2264 0.974), ADAMTS13/VWF:Rcof ( \u2264 0.946) can be diagnostic indicators of cerebral infarction.
