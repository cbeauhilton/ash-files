    "abstract_text": "Methods Genomic DNA from bone marrow and peripheral blood cells were extracted from 40 patients with MPD(male 26,female 14),Aged 13 to 76 years old, JAK2V617F mutation and CALR genetic mutations was identified by PCR- direct sequencing. Results The number of MPD(PV15,ET25) 40 cases in patients with JAK2V617F mutation rate was 60%,among them the polycythemia vera ( PV) positive rate was 66. 7% ( 10 /15) ,and essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) positive rate was 56% ( 14 /25) . The number of JAK2V617F -negative MPD 16 cases in patients with CALR mutation rate was 12. 5% ( 2 /16),Two of the 11 patients with ET were CALR mutation positive(18.2%). Two novel mutation in CALR exon 9,c.1099_1150del ( p. chr19\u0081F12915572-12915623del) was detected in patient Tao c.1099-1151delinsT( p.chr19:12915572_12915624delinsT) was detected in patient Xu. These mutation was absent in the controls,Two novel mutation in CALR have not been reported so far. Conclusion CALR gene mutations testing helps to JAK2V617F negative MPD diagnosis, makes the MPD early detection and treatment. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
