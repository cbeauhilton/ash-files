    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2152 Background: CCAAT/ enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP\u03b1) is a critical transcription factor that controls monocytic and granulocytic differentiation. Several recent studies have reported that C/EBP\u03b1 expression is down-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), leading to suppression of monocytic differentiation. All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces numerous transcriptional factors, including C/EBP\u03b1; however, ATRA alone is not sufficient to induce monocytic differentiation in AML. The purpose of this study was to identify agents that increase the efficacy of ATRA. RAD001 (Everolimus; provided by Novartis), a rapamycin analog, is a relatively new drug that inhibits the Akt/ PI3K/ mTOR pathway. To assess the utility of differentiation therapy as a treatment for types of AML other than acute promyelocytic leukemia, we evaluated the effects of RAD001 and ATRA combination treatment in several AML cell lines. Methods: Three AML cell lines (U-937, THP-1, and KOCL48) and two primary AML samples were treated with 2.5\u20135.0 nM RAD001 and 1 \u03bcM ATRA for five days. Cell growth was analyzed by counting nuclei using a Coulter counter. Monocytic differentiation was assessed by morphological analysis and flow cytometric analysis (FCM) of CD11b expression. An Annexin V assay was carried out to measure apoptosis. Microarray analysis using an Agilent expression array was employed to determine changes in gene expression associated with ATRA and RAD001 combination treatment. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed to validate the microarray results. Western blotting was carried out to measure the phosphorylation of C/EBP\u03b1 at Ser 21. Results: We determined that ATRA and RAD001 treatment induced morphological changes characteristic of monocytic differentiation. Microarray analysis of THP-1 revealed that ATRA and RAD001 induced expression of a set of genes associated with monocytic differentiation, including MPEG1, CD11b, CD115 and CD14. FCM analysis confirmed that ATRA and RAD001 intensified CD11b expression in the three cell lines tested, especially in the two ATRA-resistant cell lines (KOCL48 and U937). qRT-PCR analysis also revealed that ATRA and RAD001 treatment increased expression of C/EBP\u03b1 and C/EBP\u03b5 , which is involved in the terminal stages of monocytic differentiation, in all three cell lines and two primary samples compared to treatment with ATRA only. Expression of PU.1 was also increased by combination treatment in all cells tested except the U937 cell line. Western blot analysis revealed that ATRA and RAD001 decreased phosphorylation of C/EBP\u03b1 at serine 21. ATRA and RAD001 combination treatment also suppressed cell growth in two ATRA-resistant cell lines (growth inhibition rate: 70\u201380%). The Annexin V assay demonstrated that ATRA and RAD001 combination treatment strongly induced apoptosis in the three cell lines tested. Microarray analysis revealed that FasL , FADD, and caspase 8, which are associated with apoptotic pathways, showed the greatest degree of up-regulation in THP-1 cells treated with ATRA and RAD001. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed up-regulation of these genes in all three cell lines and in both primary AML samples, indicating that ATRA and RAD001 induce apoptosis in AML cells through the extrinsic cell death signaling pathway. Conclusions: RAD001 induced monocytic differentiation through induction of a set of genes associated with monocytic differentiation and phosphorylation of C/EBP\u03b1 at Ser 21 when combined with ATRA. This combination therapy also induced apoptosis in AML cells through activation of the extrinsic cell death signaling pathway. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
