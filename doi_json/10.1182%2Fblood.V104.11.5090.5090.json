    "abstract_text": "We previously described SL/MDS in 3/53 newly-diagnosed NB patients (pts) who received 4 cycles of high-dose cyclophosphamide (4200 mg/m2)-doxorubicin (75 mg/m2)-vincristine (CAV) and 3 cycles of high-dose cisplatin (200 mg/m2)-etoposide (600 mg/m2) (P/E), \u00b1 local radiotherapy (RT), \u00b1 immunotherapy using the anti-GD2 3F8 antibody, \u00b1 targeted RT using 131-I-3F8. With longer follow-up and the addition of a further 11 pts who received 7 cycles and 5 pts who received 6 cycles, there are 3 more cases of SL/MDS (Table1), which gives SL or MDS in 6/69 pts.

At 4+-to-72+ months (median, 19+), SL/MDS has not occurred in 46 pts treated with 5 cycles, including 19 who received thiotepa-topotecan-carboplatin (TTC) with an autologous stem-cell transplant and 11 who received both TTC and oral etoposide (E) maintenance. In routine surveillance studies, 4 pts in the 6/7-cycle group had BM cytogenetic changes (worrisome for SL) that spontaneously resolved, and 1 pt in the 5-cycle group had a cytogenetic aberration that has persisted in >90% of BM cells for 15+ months, without morphologic or clinical evidence of SL/MDS (Table 2). Allo-transplant was recommended, but not done, for this patient and for the 10 yr old with a t(3;6) translocation that was documented in 20%-to-100% of BM mitoses for 26 months before finally disappearing (Table 2).

From Dx . # of Cycles, other Rx* .

We conclude that fewer cycles of dose-intensive induction may reduce risks of SL/MDS and that BM cytogenetic abnormalities do not invariably evolve into SL or MDS. The nature of other genetic or epigenetic abnormalities that underlie such a transformation is currently unknown.",
