    "abstract_text": "Abstract 474 Thrombin (Th) is a pleiotropic protease with prothrombotic, anticoagulant and proinflammatory functions. We have characterized the mechanisms through which the binding of Th to glycoprotein (GP) Ib\u03b1, a component of the GPIb-IX-V complex on platelets, may regulate these activities. First, we tested the hypothesis, based on crystallographic evidence, that both exosite I and II of \u03b1-Th are required for binding to GPIb\u03b1. For these studies, in addition to \u03b1-Th we used meizothrombin (M-Th), a precursor with functional exosite I but without exosite II, and \u03b3-Th, a degradation product of \u03b1-Th with intact exosite II but structurally deranged exosite I. For experiments with purified components, we used a fully sulphated recombinant fragment of human GPIb\u03b1 (residues -2-290; herein designated GPIb\u03b1N) with wild-type sequence (WT) or with the single mutations Y279F (prevents sulphation) or D277N. These residues are predicted to influence predominantly or exclusively the interaction with thrombin exosite I or II, respectively. In experiments measuring the formation of a stable complex in solution, GPIb\u03b1N-WT bound \u03b1-Th and \u03b3-Th with similar characteristics, while there was no complex formed with M-Th under the same conditions. The mutation Y279F had only a modest effect, while the mutation D277N abolished formation of all complexes, indicating that exosite II is predominantly involved in binding a GPIb\u03b1 fragment in solution. To obtain more biologically relevant findings, we generated BL6 mice with platelets expressing human GPIb\u03b1 replacing the corresponding murine component in the GPIb-IX-V complex, either with wild-type sequence (h-WT strain) or with the mutations Y279F (h-279F strain) or D277N (h-277N strain). All had comparable surface expression of GPIb\u03b1 (\u223c7,000 molecules/platelet). Platelets from h-WT mice bound \u03b1-Th and \u03b3-Th in a saturable manner and with a similar apparent kd (\u223c50 nM) as human platelets. Because we could not label thrombin directly without affecting binding to platelet GPIb\u03b1, we used an indirect approach with biotin-PPACK inserted into the active site of \u03b1-Th, \u03b3-Th or M-Th detected by fluorescent streptavidin-PE. With this method, there was no demonstrable M-Th binding to platelet GPIb\u03b1. Platelets from h-279F mice showed a markedly decreased binding of \u03b1-Th (\u223c16% of that seen with h-WT platelets and kd of 450 nM) and no binding of \u03b3-Th. Neither \u03b1-Th or \u03b3-Th bound to h-277N platelets. Altogether, these results show that \u03b1-Th binding to platelet GPIb\u03b1 concurrently involves exosite I and II, and suggest that the deranged exosite I of \u03b3-Th can contribute to the interaction but is not fully functional, as shown by the greater effect of the mutation Y279F on the binding with \u03b3-Th than \u03b1-Th. Functionally, h-279F and h-277N platelets showed a significantly decreased response to stimulation by \u03b1-Th and decreased aggregation as compared to h-WT platelets, indicating that GPIb\u03b1 contributes to this prothrombotic function of \u03b1-Th. In contrast, h-WT but not h-279F or h-277N platelets inhibited fibrinogen clotting, likely a consequence of GPIb\u03b1 competing with fibrinogen for binding to \u03b1-Th exosite I, indicating that \u03b1-Th binding to GPIb\u03b1 can also have anticoagulant consequences. Thus, we have shown that GPIb\u03b1 is a relevant modulator of \u03b1-Th activity with potentially opposite effects on thrombogenesis possibly depending on the type of vascular lesion involved. Effects on inflammation remain to be explored. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
