    "abstract_text": "Objective: The study aims to investigate the effect of Tetrandrine (Tetrandrine, Tet) in combination with Droloxifen (Droloxifen, DRL) on the expression of NF-\u03baB(nuclear factor kappaB) of K562 and K562/A02 cell lines and the reversal mechanism of this combination. Method: The activation of NF-\u03baB in K562 and K562/A02 cell lines and the effect of Tet,DRL alone or in combination on NF-\u03baB were determined with Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting respectively. Results: K562/A02 cells displayed higher level of NF-\u03baB protein expression than their parental K562 cells; The application of Tet or DRL alone or in combination had no effect on NF-\u03baB expression in K562 cells at 6h and 12h; Tet and DRL used alone or in combination could significantly down-regulate NF-\u03baB protein expression in nucleaus of K562/A02 cells. The effect was more significant in combination of Tet and DRL than the application of single drug. This decrease became more significant at 12h than at 6h. Conclusions: Activation of NF-\u03baB may be involved in the mechanism of MDR of K562/A02 cell line; Inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation may be involved in the mechanism of multidrug resistance reversal to K562/A02 line of Tet and DRL.",
