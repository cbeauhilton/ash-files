    "abstract_text": "Background CD47 is an innate immune checkpoint that binds signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP\u03b1) and delivers a \"don't eat me\" signal to suppress macrophage phagocytosis. Overexpression of CD47 can allow tumor cells to escape immune surveillance. TTI-621 (SIRP\u03b1Fc) is a fusion protein consisting of the CD47 binding domain of human SIRP\u03b1 linked to the Fc region of human IgG1, designed to enhance phagocytosis and antitumor activity by blocking the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 interaction between malignant cells and macrophages, and engaging Fc\u03b3 receptors. Here we report updates from the dose optimization part of the first-in-human study of TTI-621 (NCT02663518), testing dose levels between 0.5-2.0 mg/kg in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Methods This study has been conducted in 4 parts. Part 1 tested increasing weekly intravenous doses of TTI-621 based on 3+3 escalation. The maximum tolerated dose was initially determined to be 0.2 mg/kg based on dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of thrombocytopenia [defined as Grade (Gr) 4 of any duration]. Expanded testing followed in patients with hematologic malignancies. In Part 2, most patients received 0.2 mg/kg; however, based on investigator discretion, a subset of patients received escalating doses up to 0.5 mg/kg. In Part 3, patients with T-cell lymphomas received stepwise dose escalations from 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg over the first 5\u22128 weeks. Part 4 (dose optimization) of this study, is currently ongoing with weekly TTI-621 treatment escalating in a standard 3+3 manner through 5 planned dose levels including 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.4, and 2 mg/kg. Dose optimization is being assessed in patients with CTCL. The DLT criteria was modified to require Gr 4 thrombocytopenia lasting >72 hours. Safety monitoring includes weekly clinical laboratories and assessments of adverse events (AEs) per CTCAE v 4.03. Blood samples are obtained for pharmacokinetics and disease assessments are performed per Olsen's criteria. Results In Parts 1\u22123 (n=214), the most common related AEs were infusion-related reaction (IRR, 43%; 3% Gr \u22653), thrombocytopenia (30%; 22% Gr \u22653), chills (22%; 0% Gr \u22653), and fatigue (16%; 1% Gr \u22653). Objective responses to single agent TTI-621 were achieved in 14/71 (20%) NHL pts including CTCL (n=42, 1 CR, 7 PRs), PTCL (n=22, 2 CRs, 2 PRs) and DLBCL (n=7, 1 CR, 1 PR). In Part 4 as of April 12, 2021, 24 patients (17M/7F, median age 65 years) have enrolled into the 5 dose cohorts including 9 patients in the 2.0 mg/kg dose level. CTCL subtypes enrolled include mycosis fungoides (MF, n=18) and S\u00e9zary syndrome (SS, n=6). Disease stage was advanced (\u2265IIB) in 16 (67%) patients and a median of 3 (range 1\u221212) prior systemic therapies were received. Related AEs occurred in 19 (79%; 33% Gr \u22653) patients including infusion-related reaction (IRR, 50%; 13% Gr \u22653), thrombocytopenia (33%; 25% Gr \u22653), and neutropenia and headache, (13%, 0% Gr \u22653, each). Thrombocytopenia generally occurred on dosing days, and typically recovered within 2-4 days. A total of 15 IRRs have occurred in 12 (50%) patients at all doses levels. Most IRRs occurred during initial infusions only and typically resolved within the day of occurrence. The occurrence of Gr 3 IRRs prompted the addition of corticosteroids to the pre-medication regimen which largely prevent their occurrence. Aside from IRRs and thrombocytopenia which was manageable, AEs were predominantly Gr \u22642. Pharmacokinetic results reveal continued dose-dependent increases in exposure. Objective responses have been observed in 4 of 20 (20%) evaluable patients to date, including 3 partial responses in 14 patients with MF and 1 complete response in 6 patients with SS. Treatment is ongoing in the patient who achieved CR (10+ months) and in 2 of 3 patients who achieved PR (3 and 4 months). A third patient who achieved PR elected to discontinue study treatment at 5 months to pursue allogeneic stem and progenitor cell transplantation. Conclusions Preliminary results from dose optimization testing indicate that weekly infusions of TTI-621 up to 2 mg/kg are generally well tolerated. In Part 4, an overall response rate of 20% has been observed thus far in patients with CTCL. Testing of TTI-621 in alternative dosing schedules is in progress. With demonstrated good tolerability and robust single agent antitumor activity in heavily pre-treated patients, additional testing of TTI-621 beyond relapsed/refractory lymphoma has started.
