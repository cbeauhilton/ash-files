    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2951 Poster Board II-927 Background: Expression signatures of infiltrating immune cells [1] have been shown to predict survival in follicular lymphoma (FL), but have not been cross-validated in independent patient cohorts [2,3]. These signatures may relate biologically to the frequency of infiltrating including T-cells and macrophages, or to specific transcription programs within tumor cells and/or the tumor microenvironment. We sought to evaluate the validity of this model in an independent cohort of patients with FL, assessing its relationship to outcomes including histological transformation and death. Methods: The immune response (IR) predictor score proposed by Dave et al. [1] was applied to gene expression data from an independent cohort of 88 FL patients [4] with known survival outcomes and history of transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Genes (n=66) corresponding to IR1 and IR2 signatures were mapped from Affymetrix microarrays [1] to a custom cDNA array [4] via Entrez Gene ID, and the composite IR score was calculated per the scheme proposed by Dave et al. Results: The IR score was predictive of patient outcome in the 88 patient test set as a continuous variable (p=0.001, HR=2.01, 95% CI 0.50-1.30). Partitioning of patients into high and low risk groups based on the median IR score across the cohort robustly separated survival curves ( Figure A ). The IR score was significantly higher in FL patients known to undergo transformation to DLBCL ( Figure B : mean IR score of -0.6 in non-transforming FL vs. -0.2 in transforming FL; p\u223c10 -11 , t-test). Conclusions: The IR score of Dave et al. was highly significant as a predictor of survival in the independent patient cohort [4]. Moreover, the score was significantly associated with propensity of FL to transform to DLBCL. To our knowledge, immune cell infiltration has not previously been implicated in transformation. 1.
