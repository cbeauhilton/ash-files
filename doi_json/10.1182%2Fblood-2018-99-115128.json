    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited red blood cell disorder that leads to vaso-occlusion, endothelial damage, and activation of pro-coagulant pathways. Recent studies have demonstrated that thrombotic episodes occur at a 3- to 100-fold higher rate (PMID: 17000225, 22417249) in SCD versus non-SCD populations but the risk factors for thrombosis are not clear. We investigated the incidence and predictors for thrombosis in a longitudinal cohort of 1193 SCD patients treated at our institution between 1/2008 and 12/2017. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from the electronic medical records from the first outpatient encounter during this time period. Linear and categorical variables were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-square test, respectively, and Cox proportional hazard models were adjusted for age, sex, SCD genotype, and hydroxyurea use. With a median follow up of 5.6 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2.3-9.3 years), 210 SCD patients (17.6%) had 347 arterial or venous thromboses (75 stroke, 272 venous thromboembolism [VTE]) that occurred after 1/1/2008. Clinical and laboratory risk factors according to the occurrence of arterial or venous thrombosis are provided in Table 1 . In Cox proportional hazards analysis, HbSS/S\u03b2 0 -thalassemia (HR 3.0, P<0.0001), hospitalization rate (10/year increment HR 1.3, P<0.0001), and higher serum creatinine (natural log HR 1.6, P=0.01) were independently associated with incident thrombotic events ( Figure 1 ). A subset of 174 SCD patients experienced the 272 VTEs; 153 (56%) deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 98 (36%) pulmonary embolism, 17 (6%) concurrent DVT and pulmonary embolism, and 4 (1%) right atrial thrombus. In those with a DVT, 116 were upper and 54 were lower extremity DVTs. 92 of the upper extremity DVTs and all 4 right atrial thrombi were catheter-related. In Cox proportional hazards analysis, independent risk factors for the development of VTE during the observation period were greater hospitalization rate (10/year increment HR 1.3, P<0.0001), higher systolic blood pressure (10-mmHg increase HR 1.2, P=0.002), HbSS/S\u03b2 0 -thalassemia (HR 2.1, P=0.004), and higher AST (natural log HR 1.6, P=0.01). The anticoagulation used during the initial VTE was warfarin in 115 (66%), oral direct factor Xa inhibitors in 29 (17%), low-molecular weight heparin in 16 (9%), and no therapy in 14 (8%) patients. Of those treated with an anticoagulant, 83 (52%) received initial therapy for 3-6 months, 47 (29%) for >6 months and 30 (19%) for < 3 months. A recurrent VTE occurred in 31 SCD patients (18% of those experiencing an initial VTE) and was not associated with either the type or duration of anticoagulation therapy. We investigated whether genetic risk variants for thrombosis in African Americans (PMID: 26888256 and 21232005) were associated with thrombotic events in SCD. In a subset of 329 SCD patients with genome-wide genotyping performed using the Affymetrix Pan-African Axiom GeneChip array, we replicated the association with thrombosis of two variants in thrombomodulin (PMID: 26888256), THBD rs2567617 (MAF 0.25, OR 1.5, P=0.049) and rs1998081 (MAF 0.24, OR 1.5, P=0.059) after adjusting for age, sex, SCD genotype, and hydroxyurea. Thrombomodulin is an endothelial cell surface glycoprotein which promotes protein C activation and reduces circulating thrombin levels. In conclusion, thrombotic events are common, occurring in 18% of SCD patients over a 10-year follow-up period. HbSS/S\u03b2 0 -thalassemia, frequent hospitalizations, kidney disease, and higher systolic blood pressures and AST concentrations were risk factors for thrombosis. Genome-wide marker array analysis points to a potential role of thrombomodulin in SCD-related thrombotic events based on replicated risk variants in THBD . Future studies integrating clinical, laboratory and genetic risk factors may improve our understanding for thrombosis and guide intervention practices in SCD.
