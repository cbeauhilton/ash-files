    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1493 The induction of cell-mediated immunity to pathogens is the prime task of cells of the innate immune system. Integrin \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 (Mac-1, CR3, CD11b/CD18) is expressed on polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), monocytes, macrophages (MFC) and NK cells and has been implicated in diverse responses of these cells to infection, including phagocytosis, cell-mediated killing, chemotaxis and cellular activation. In PMNs integrin \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 serves as the principal receptor involved in recognition of the common opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans, and this integrin recognizes the fungal mannoprotein pH-regulated Antigen 1 (Pra1). Professional antigen-presenting cells of myeloid lineage MFC and dendritic cells express integrin \u03b1 X \u03b2 2 (p150,95, CD11c/CD18) which is highly homologous to Integrin \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 , but the role of \u03b1 X \u03b2 2 in the immune response to bacterial and fungal infections remains unclear. Employing \u03b1 M - and \u03b1 X -KO mice and mutated strains of C. albicans in a model of murine systemic candidiasis, we first demonstrate that mice deficient in \u03b1 X \u03b2 2 exhibit significantly increased susceptibility to the invasive fungal infection. C. albicans induced lethality in \u03b1 X \u03b2 2 -KO mice more rapidly (2- to 3-fold faster) than the same inoculum in wild-type mice. MFC derived from mice deficient in \u03b1 \u00d7 \u03b2 2 have a reduced ability to kill or phagocyte C. albicans . When the fungus was injected into mice, 6 hrs after peritoneal of thioglycollate, neutrophil recruitment to C. albicans showed a 20%-30% clearance of the fungus in the \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 -KO murine intraperitoneal lavages and a 50\u201360% rise in the \u03b1 X \u03b2 2 -KO lavages, which is consistent with our prior data showing \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 -dependency for PMNs-mediated antifungal defense activity. In contrast, when the fungus was injected into the peritoneal cavity 16 hrs after thioglycollate, when most recruited leukocytes are MFC, the C. albicans injected into \u03b1 X \u03b2 2 -KO mice showed a 23%-25% clearance of the fungus from the lavages while fungal clearance in \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 -KO lavages increased by only 30\u201340%. Thus, MFC antifungal activity is \u03b1 X \u03b2 2 -dependent. These results were further confirmed by in vitro fungicide assays employing isolated murine peritoneal PMNs and MFC. Fungal survival was greatest with PMN derived from \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 -KO mice and MFC derived from the \u03b1 X \u03b2 2 -KO mice-derived MFC. Disruption of the PRA1 gene of C. albicans, which is the primary ligand for \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 , had no effect on MFC fungicide activity, which suggests that \u03b1 X \u03b2 2 recognizes a C. albicans ligand different from Pra1. Taken together, these results suggest that \u03b1 X \u03b2 2 is a principal receptor for C. albicans on macrophages and plays critical role in host antifungal defense in a Pra1-independent mechanism.
