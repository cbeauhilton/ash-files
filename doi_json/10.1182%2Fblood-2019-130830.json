    "abstract_text": "Multiple Myeloma (MM) remains an incurable malignancy, despite the advent of several new therapeutic agents, including immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs, e.g. , Lenalidomide (Len)) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs, e.g ., Bortezomib (Btz)). Accordingly, there is an urgent need to identify new targetable vulnerabilities for MM patients. We developed an ex vivo 384-well platform that allows one to define drug sensitivities of primary patient CD138+ MM cells in the context of a reconstructed tumor microenvironment (TME), including allogeneic bone marrow stromal cells, extracellular matrix and MM patient serum. Using this platform and activity-based proteomic profiling (ABPP), we identified shared signaling pathways induced by the interactions of MM with stromal cells and integrated these data with screens performed using a bank of protein kinase inhibitors (PKI) and current anti-MM therapeutics. These analyses revealed that the serine/threonine kinases casein kinase-1\u03b4 (CK1\u03b4) and CK1\u03b5 as high priority targets for MM. Indeed, a highly selective and potent dual inhibitor of CK1\u03b4/CK1\u03b5 coined SR-3029 is the most potent PKI versus MM. Further, our studies revealed SR-3029 has potent activity in 138/153 primary patient MM specimens tested thus far, including quad and penta-refractory MM. Analysis of RNAseq data of over 600 Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) MM patients revealed that patients with high expression of CK1\u03b5 had worse survival outcomes while no survival difference was seen with CK1\u03b4 expression. Importantly, using the established 5TGM1/Kal-Ridge (C57B6/KaLwRijHsd) syngeneic mouse model of multiple myeloma, we show that tumors derived from 5TGM1 MM cells, which rapidly die following exposure to SR-3029 ex vivo , are also sensitive to CK1\u03b4/CK1\u03b5 inhibition in vivo , where SR-3029 treatment reduced tumor burden and significantly improved survival. Similar results were observed using NSG immune compromised animals inoculated with human MM1.S multiple myeloma cells (both flank and tail vein models), where SR-3029 treated animals had reduced tumor burden and extended survival. Analysis of RNAseq on patients' samples (on stroma) treated ex vivo with SR-3029 revealed CK1\u03b4/CK1\u03b5 inhibition suppressed multiple metabolic pathways (oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, xenobiotic metabolism). Interestingly, analyses of MCC MM patient RNAseq data revealed upregulation of the genes identified in these metabolic pathways as patients progress from pre-treatment to relapse, and that patient MM samples that were resistant to CK1\u03b4/CK1\u03b5 inhibition had an upregulation of some of these metabolic genes. Functional studies are being performed to define the mechanism(s) by which CK1\u03b4/CK1\u03b5 inhibition disables MM metabolism. Collectively, these findings establish CK1\u03b5 and/or CK1\u03b4 as attractive targets for anti-myeloma therapy that are required to sustain MM metabolism. Disclosures Dai: M2Gen: Employment.
