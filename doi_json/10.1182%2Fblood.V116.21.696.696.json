    "abstract_text": "Abstract 696 The ability of cancer cells to modulate the immune microenvironment is now recognized as an important hallmark of disease pathophysiology. Identifying the molecular mechanisms of cancer immune suppression in the laboratory is key to the design of more effective immunotherapeutic treatment strategies. We previously demonstrated that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells induce alterations in global gene expression profiles in patient CD4 and CD8 T cells, and a profound T cell immunological synapse formation defect that can be reversed with lenalidomide (J Clin Invest. 2005;115(7):1797-1805, and 2008;118(7):2427-2437). Here we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) with a 2-part functional screen to identify key CLL cell molecules inducing T cell immune suppression. siRNA treated tumor cells were cocultured in direct contact with healthy allogeneic T cells for 24 hours, T cells purified from coculture and used in cell conjugation immune synapse assays with superantigen-pulsed third party B cells as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Confocal microscopy and image analysis software was used to quantify the mean area of T cell F-actin immune synapse formation events from each experimental cell population. Treatment of the CLL cell line MEC-1 with either TNF\u03b1, TGF\u03b2, IL-10, or IL-6 siRNA identified no gain in subsequent CD3 T cell immune synapse function compared to control non-targeting siRNA or untreated CLL cells. However, CD200 or programmed death 1 (PD1) ligand 1 (PD-L1, CD274) siRNA treatment significantly enhanced ( P < .01) subsequent T cell synapse formation events with APCs (comparable to positive control experiments blocking tumor cell:T cell direct contact with ICAM-1 siRNA, or primary coculture of T cells with allogeneic healthy donor B cells). Primary CLL patient cells (n=10) were treated with individual or pooled neutralizing antibodies, or siRNA, targeting PD-L1, CD200, or cytokines. This analysis revealed that counteracting the combined activity of PD-L1, CD200 and TGF\u03b2 exhibited the most pronounced repair of subsequent T cell synapse function compared to control treated tumor cells ( P < .01). These data suggest that CLL-released cytokines such as TGF\u03b2 contribute to, but are not essential for the T cell synapse defect. We also identified that blocking the T cell receptors PD-1, CD200-R and TGF\u03b2-R1 with neutralizing antibodies prevents CLL inhibitory signaling ( P < .01) compared to isotype control IgG treated T cells in contact with tumor cells. We further show that knock-down of PD-L1, CD200 and TGF\u03b2 on ex vivo CLL cells prevents inhibitory CD4 and CD8 T cell synapse function compared to control siRNA ( P < .01) using the E\u03bc-TCL1 mouse model of CLL. The addition of lenalidomide (1\u03bcM) in ex vivo CLL cell:T cell coculture assays significantly increased ( P < .01) subsequent T cell synapse function compared to untreated vehicle control experiments. Flow cytometric analysis identified that lenalidomide down-regulates both CLL expressed PD-L1 and CD200 ligands, and T cell cognate receptor PD1 and CD200R expression during intercellular contact interactions. Moreover, subsequent effector T cell killing function was significantly enhanced ( P < .05) following antibody blockade of CLL cell PD-L1 and CD200 with or without lenalidomide treatment during primary coculture with CD8 T cells. We are currently investigating the expression and activity of PD-L1, CD200, and other co-inhibitory molecules in CLL and other haematological and solid malignancies, using patient tissue microarray analysis and confocal co-localization analysis. This work is identifying common inhibitory ligands utilized by tumor cells to suppress T cell synapse function. These results provide important mechanistic insight into immune suppression in CLL and the action of lenalidomide, and identify co-inhibitory ligands as potential immunotherapeutic targets to repair T cell function.
