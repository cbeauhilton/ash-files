    "abstract_text": "Background The PI3-kinase signaling pathway and the Bcl-2-family of proteins play crucial roles in regulating the survival and proliferation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in the bone marrow and lymph nodes. Trials of ibrutinib, idelalisib and venetoclax illustrate the potential of targeting the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway and Bcl-2, however disease relapse is still common. Several pre-clinical studies and on-going clinical trials [Rogers et al., 2018, Jain et al., 2019] suggest that combinations of BCR inhibitors with venetoclax may be an effective treatment strategy for CLL patients with high risk disease. We sought to investigate the effects of combining idelalisib or the AKT inhibitor MK2206 with venetoclax against CLL cells under in vitro conditions that mimic the tumor microenvironment. Methods Primary CLL cells were co-cultured with CD40L-expressing mouse L-fibroblasts. Cell viability was assessed using the mitochondrial membrane potential dye DilC 1 (5), propidium iodide and flow cytometry (n = 6). Synergy between idelalisib or MK2206 and venetoclax was evaluated by calculating combination indices (CI) using the Compusyn software. The mechanisms of action of the drugs and synergies between the drugs were investigated by immunoblotting (n = 6). Results Venetoclax was highly synergistic in combination with idelalisib or MK2206 against CLL cells co-cultured with CD40L-fibroblasts, with CI values of 0.2 and 0.5 at a fractional effect of 0.9, respectively (Figure 1). This synergy was consistent with a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in the IC50 for venetoclax, idelalisib and MK2206. Immunoblotting suggests that MK2206, as a single agent or in combination with venetoclax, was more effective than idelalisib in inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT and NF-\u03baB. Both MK2206 and idelalisib as single agents and in combination with venetoclax significantly reduced expression of Mcl-1 and Bfl-1, two pro-survival members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins in primary CLL cells co-cultured with CD40L-fibroblasts. Conclusions The synergy observed, which was associated with a significant decrease in the IC50s for idelalisib and MK2206, may mitigate some of the toxicities associated with PI3-kinase pathway inhibitors. Comparison of the two PI3-kinase-pathway inhibitors suggests that MK2206 may be more effective than idelalisib at blocking BCR-mediated signaling as a single agent and in combination with venetoclax. The mechanisms underlying the synergy include down-regulation of expression of Bcl-2 family proteins that are not targeted by venetoclax as a single agent. The data presented support the rationale for on-going and future clinical trials of combination therapies incorporating a PI3-kinase inhibitor with venetoclax for the treatment of high risk CLL.
