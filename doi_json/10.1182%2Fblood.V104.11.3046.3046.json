    "abstract_text": "Donor leucocyte infusions (DLI) given to established mixed chimeras (MC) can eliminate normal and malignant hematopoietic cells without causing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Identical DLI transferred immediately following lethal irradiation lead to severe GVHD. In contrast to freshly irradiated mice developing GVHD, established MC receiving DLI show delayed kinetics of effector/memory T cell (T E/M ) expansion and a distinct distribution with no accumulation of cells in the gut. Lethal irradiation is associated with tissue injury, altered chemokine expression and cytokine dysregulation, and resolution of these changes is important in limiting GVHD following delayed DLI. In an attempt to define the respective roles of \u2018intrinsic\u2019 T cell versus \u2018extrinsic\u2019 environmental factors in shaping the character of the GVH response elicited, T E/M developing following GVHD induction were transferred to established MC. Conversely, T E/M developing following delayed DLI to MC were transferred to lethally-irradiated 2\u00b0 recipients. In the first series of experiments, we transferred 1 x 10 7 C57BL/6 (B6) splenocytes and 5 x 10 6 B6 T-cell depleted bone marrow (TCD BM) to lethally-irradiated BALB/c recipients. On day 4 following BMT, when GVH-reactive T cell activation and expansion was maximal, 3 x 10 6 nylon wool-passaged T E/M derived from recipient spleens (equivalent to 1 recipient spleen to 1 secondary recipient) were transferred to established B6 \u2192 BALB/c MC or to lethally irradiated BALB/c 2\u00b0 recipients. The latter mice received B6 TCD BM to prevent death from aplasia. Secondary established MC recipients were resistant to GVHD whereas the lethally-irradiated 2\u00b0 recipients developed severe, lethal GVHD (median survival time-MST- mixed chimeras >100d versus irradiated mice 52d, p<0.0001). Histological studies confirmed that 4/5 lethally-irradiated 2\u00b0 recipients developed colitis versus 0/4 MC. T E/M derived from GVHD mice did not increase donor chimerism in 2\u00b0 MC recipients. In reciprocal experiments, we transferred 2.5 x 10 7 B6 CD45.1 splenocytes to established B6 CD45.2 \u2192 B6D2F1 MC. This number of splenocytes represents the dose required to convert 100% of MC to full donor chimerism without induction of lethal GVHD. On day 12 post-DLI, when GVH-reactive T-cell expansion was maximal, a cohort of recipient mice was sacrificed and splenocytes harvested. On the basis of 1 recipient spleen to 1 secondary recipient, 2.7 x 10 7 nylon wool-passaged lymphocytes were transferred to 2\u00b0 freshly-irradiated B6D2F1 recipients together with B6 TCD BM. In parallel, we depleted host-derived cells by sorting for DLI-derived CD45.1+ lymphocytes and transferred these cells on the basis of 1 recipient to 1 2\u00b0 recipient (7 x 10 6 lymphocytes) to a second cohort of lethally-irradiated recipients. After a lag-period of about 20 days, 2\u00b0 recipients of non-fractionated cells lost >10% weight and developed clinical signs of mild GVHD, but then showed almost complete recovery by day 60 post-BMT. In sharp contrast, after a similar lag period, 2\u00b0 recipients of CD45.1+-selected lymphocytes developed severe lethal GVHD (MST CD45.1+ cells 55d vs >100d non-fractionated cells, p<0.0005). In conclusion, these findings suggest that the host environment strongly influences the capacity of T E/M to induce GVHD. Furthermore, host-derived cells pre-existing in or developing following delayed DLI, reduce the potential of T E/M to induce GVHD."
