    "abstract_text": "HuMax-CD20 is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody targeting a unique extracellular epitope of the CD20 molecule on B-cells. HuMax-CD20 stops growth of engrafted B-cell tumors in SCID mouse tumor models more efficiently than Rituximab\u00ae, and i.v. infusion of HuMax-CD20 in cynomolgus monkeys has led to profound, long lasting, dose-dependent B-cell depletion. A total of 40 patients with CD20+ relapsed or refractory follicular non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma grade I-II will be enrolled in this open-label, dose-escalating, international, multi-center clinical trial. Cohorts of 10 patients will receive i.v. infusions at doses of either 300, 500, 700 or 1000 mg once weekly for 4 weeks. The patients are followed for 12 months. Patients receive oral acetaminophen and i.v. antihistamin before infusion. In case of adverse events of CTC grade 3 or higher, i.v. glucocorticosteroids are given. The endpoints are CT scan verified tumor response according to the Cheson criteria, B-cell depletion in peripheral blood and lymph nodes, time to next anti-lymphoma treatment, duration of response, BCL2 conversion, pharmacokinetics, and adverse events. Tumor and bone marrow biopsies and CT scans are assessed centrally. The first 17 patients treated with HuMax-CD20 are the subject of this report. Mean age is 60 years. In the 300 mg group all 10 patients have received all 4 infusions. Seven patients have been enrolled in the 500 mg group; three of them have received 4 infusions, two have received 3 infusions, and two patients have received 2 infusions. Baseline B-cell count was in the range of 11-382 x 10 6 cells per L with a median of 114 x 10 6 . One week after the first infusion the median B-cell count available in 16 patients was 8 x 10 6 cells per L with a range of 0\u201319 x 10 6 . In six of the 16 patients no B-cells were detected. B-cell counts measured one week after the 4 th infusion are available for 10 patients. Eight patients had no detectable B-cells, one patient had 11 x 10 6 and one had 34 x 10 6 cells per L. B-cell counts eight weeks after the 4 th infusion are available for two patients. No B-cells were detectable in these two patients. No dose limiting toxicity has been reported with administration of 300 or 500 mg. One serious adverse event assessed as not related to HuMax-CD20 has been reported in the 300 mg group. Infusion related adverse events have primarily been seen during the first infusion of HuMax-CD20. The events have, as expected, predominantly been signs and symptoms of cytokine release, e.g. pruritus, dyspnoea, rigors/chills, nausea, hypotension, urticaria, fatigue, fever and rash. In 15 of the 17 patients, 51 adverse events have been reported. Nine adverse events were CTC grade 3, 16 were grade 2, and 26 events were grade 1. In conclusion, this analysis based on preliminary data for the first 17 patients treated with HuMax-CD20 demonstrated significant depletion of peripheral blood B-cells and a favorable safety profile. An updated report of results for all 40 patients including preliminary tumor response data will be presented.",
