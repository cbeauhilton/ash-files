    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4012 Background: Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a cytokine essential for T cell development in the thymus and maintenance of peripheral T cells. IL-7 binds to cellular IL-7 receptors (IL-7Ra-common g chain heterodimer), in competition with a soluble form of the receptor, shed by the cells (sIL-7Ra). We have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in the exons of the gene encoding IL-7Ra (+510T/C rs1494558, +1237 G/C rs1494555, 2087 C/T rs6897932), and previous results by us and by others indicate that IL-7R SNPs are associated with aGvHD and mortality after SCT. Moreover, the biological significance of +2087 C/T SNP has been suggested by the finding of elevated serum levels of sIL-7Ra in healthy individuals with 2087CC (Haplotype 4), also associated with increased alternative splicing of exon 6 and a higher frequency of recent thymic emigrants. We hypothesized that sIL-7Ra levels during SCT are influenced by genetic polymorphism and may play a role in immune reconstitution after SCT. Aims: 1) To investigate sIL-7Ra levels during SCT along with IL-7Ra genotypes and 2) to evaluate associations between sIL-7Ra levels and immune reconstitution and outcome in SCT. Patients and Methods: 122 patients undergoing SCT for haematological malignancies after either myeloablative (n= 52) or reduced intensity conditioning (n=70) were included. Donors were either matched siblings (n=68) or matched unrelated donors (n=54), and the patient age at the time of transplant was 50 years (6\u201367) (median (range)). sIL-7Ra levels were measured in plasma by a quantitative bead capture assay. IL-7Ra SNPs were determined by a SSP-PCR system and IL-7 was tested by ELISA (R&D) (n=77). Results: sIL-7Ra levels decreased during the course of transplantation from 113 ng/ml (32\u2013558) at day \u221215 to 48 ng/ml (32\u2013195) at day +14 (p=0.0001), and reached baseline levels again at day +60. sIL-7Ra levels were not associated with the intensity of the conditioning regimen. This pattern appeared to be inversely mirrored by the IL-7 levels, which increased from baseline values at day \u201314 of 2.4 pg/ml (0.3\u201317.6) to 11.3 pg/ml (2.0\u201330.2) (p<0.0001) at day +14, followed by a gradual decline down to baseline values at day +60. sIL-7Ra levels at day +90 were reduced in patients transplanted with donors carrying IL-7Ra 2087T allele, in line with our previous findings in healthy individuals (105 ng/ml (42\u2013274) vs. 152 ng/ml (20\u2013971), p=0.0015). In addition, post-transplant sIL-7Ra levels correlated with pre-transplant sIL-7Ra levels (r=0.39 p=0.0032), indicating that patient related factors in addition to the genotype of the donor lymphocytes may play a role in the regulation of sIL-7Ra levels post-transplant. sIL-7Ra appeared to be predictive of the rate of immune reconstitution by the finding that sIL-7Ra at day +14 correlated significantly with total lymphocyte counts post-transplant (day +90: r=0.28 (p=0.031) and day +180: r=0.55 (p<0.0001)). In contrast, IL-7Ra genotypes were not associated with immune lymphocyte counts post-transplant and early post-transplant IL-7 levels did not correlate significantly with lymphocyte counts at any stage. Outcomes: There was a trend towards an association between high sIL-7Ra levels and increased overall survival (p=0.057), but sIL-7Ra levels were unrelated to the occurrence of aGvHD. However, the IL-7/sIL-7Ra ratio at day +14 was significantly higher in patients with grade 2\u20134 aGvHD compared to grade 0\u20131 aGvHD (0.29 (0.04\u20130.73) vs 0.19 (0.01\u20130.8), p=0.033). Conclusion: The data of the present study indicates that sIL-7Ra levels after SCT are determined by the IL-7R 2087 genotype of the donor in addition to patient related factors. sIL-7Ra levels in the early phase post transplant is associated with the rate of lymphocyte recovery post-SCT. Thereby this study adds to the growing evidence suggesting the importance of the IL-7 axis in SCT. The study further suggests that monitoring sIL-7Ra levels post-transplant may help to guide the clinical use of IL-7. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
