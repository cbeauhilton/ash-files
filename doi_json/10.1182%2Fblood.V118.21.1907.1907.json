    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1907 Defining in vivo effects and biodistribution of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hMSCs) following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) could impact the clinical utility of MSC therapy for the prevention and treatment of graft- versus -host disease (GvHD). Using an established model of murine alloBMT, we defined hMSC effects on GvHD and graft- versus -leukemia (GvL) activity. We first studied whether hMSC could modulate in vitro murine T-cell (TC) alloreactivity in mixed leukocyte cultures (MLCs). Specifically, hMSCs added to MLCs significantly reduced TC proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner distinct from human fibroblasts. In contrast to MLC cultures alone, MLCs containing hMSCs had significant reduction in TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, and IL-10 levels and higher levels of PGE2 and TGF\u03b21. Modulation in the inflammatory milieu was associated with changes in TC phenotypes, including more nai\u0308ve and less activated TC surface marker expression (CD62L + CD69 \u2212 ) and the induction of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + T-regulatory cells. To determine whether hMSCs could modulate in vivo mTC alloreactivity, irradiated recipient B6D2F1 (H-2 bxd ) mice were transplanted with allogeneic C57BL/6 (H-2 b ) BM and purified splenic TCs (B6\u2192B6D2F1) and then were tail-vein injected with hMSC infusions (1 million per injection) on days one and four post-transplant. Syngeneic transplant recipients (B6D2F1\u2192B6D2F1) were used as controls. hMSC-treated alloBMT mice had significantly prolonged survival and improved clinical GvHD scores, reduced splenic TC expansion and TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3-producing TCs, and lower circulating TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 levels versus untreated alloBMT mice. Bioluminescence imaging showed redistribution of labeled hMSCs from the lungs to abdominal organs within 72 hours following infusion. Importantly, GvHD target tissues (small and large bowel and liver) harvested from hMSC-treated alloBMT mice had significantly lower GvHD pathology scores than untreated alloBMT mice. We next determined the effects of hMSCs on GvL activity using the murine mastocytoma cell line, P815 (H-2 d ). TCs co-cultured with hMSCs maintained potent in vitro cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity comparable to untreated control CTLs. After challenge with P815 tumor cells, hMSCs-treated alloBMT mice had less severe GvHD, eradication of tumor burden, and improved leukemia-free survival compared to alloBMT control mice. Lastly, indomethacin (IM) added to MLC-hMSC co-cultures significantly reversed attenuation in both murine TC alloreactivity and surface activation expression. In addition, IM administered to hMSC-treated alloBMT mice reversed hMSC-associated survival advantage, suggesting that PGE2 in part mediates hMSC immunomodulatory effects. Together, our results show that hMSC infusions effectively attenuate GvHD and maintain GvL potency in alloBMT mice and reveal potential biomarkers and mechanisms of action underlying hMSC effects.
