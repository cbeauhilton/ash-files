    "abstract_text": "Introduction. The potential drug-drug interactions of midostaurin (M), particularly with CYP450 inhibitors, may impact the choice of antifungal (AF) prophylaxis and treatment in FLT3-positive (FLT3+) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (pts). However, there are no supportive data to guide the choice of AF drugs in this subset of pts. Aim . To evaluate the incidence of invasive fungal diseases (IFD) during induction and consolidation treatment of FLT3+ AML pts and to correlate it to the different AF prophylaxis strategies adopted. Patients and Methods. Within the SEIFEM (Sorveglianza Epidemiologica Infezioni nelle Emopatie) Group, we planned a restrospective/prospective multicenter observational study enrolling all FLT3+ AML pts treated with chemotherapy (CHT)+M. IFD were classified as possible, probable and proven according to EORTC/MSG revised definitions (Donnelly JP et al, Clin Infect Dis 2020). Relationships between the type of AF prophylaxis, IFD development and AML outcome were evaluated. Results . As of 30 th June, 90 pts treated with CHT+M as induction/reinduction, consolidation or both, have been enrolled. M/F ratio was 35/55, median age 56y (range 18-78). FLT-ITD and FLT3-TKD mutations were detected in 73 and 17 pts, respectively, NPM-1 mutation in 51 (57%) pts. AML risk stratification according to ELN classification was available in 80 pts (24 low risk). A total of 216 CHT+M courses have been delivered (85 inductions, 8 reinductions and 135 consolidations). Overall, 25 IFD were reported: 19 during induction (22%), 2 during reinduction (25%) and 4 during consolidation (3%) given without AF prophylaxis in all the four. Sixty-five (72%) pts achieved complete remission (CR) after the induction. During induction, 11 pts did not receive mold-active AF prophylaxis and developed 4 (36%) IFD (3 possible and 1 probable aspergillosis), while 74 pts received mold-active AF prophylaxis and developed 15 (20%) IFD (8 possible and 4 probable aspergillosis, 3 candidemia). Incidence according to mold-active AF prophylaxis strategy was: 7/40 (17%) with posaconazole 300 mg/d, 5/13 (38%) with echinocandins (micafungin 50 mg/d or caspofungin 70>50 mg/d), 2/17 (12%) with posaconazole given for 7 days followed by micafungin or caspofungin, 1/2 with isavuconazole 200 mg/d, and 0/2 with L-AmB 50 mg every other day). A posaconazole-containing AF prophylaxis regimen was protective against IFD (9/57, 16%, vs 10/28, 36%, p=0.05), while a trend toward a higher incidence of IFD was observed in pts receiving echinocandins alone as AF prophylaxis (5/13, 38%, vs 14/72, 19%, p=0.15). IFD were more frequent in pts aged 60y or older (11/31, 35%, vs 8/54, 15%, p=0.034), while no correlations between IFD and gender, ELN classification, failure to achieve CR were observed. At multivariate analysis, age\u226560y was confirmed as a risk factor for IFD (OR 3.021, CI 1.028-8.849), while receiving AF prophylaxis without posaconazole was of borderline significance (OR 2.817, CI 0.955-8.306). Three pts out of 40 on posaconazole prophylaxis received reduced dose of M (50 mg/d). M was discontinued in 12 pts during induction; of these, 6 (50%) did not achieve a CR. IFD was the main reason for M discontinuation in 6 pts; in the other 6, toxicity was responsible (QTc prolongation in 3, 1 during caspofungin, 1 during posaconazole and 1 out of AF prophylaxis; gastrointestinal toxicity in 2, 1 during posaconazole and 1 during caspofungin prophylaxis; liver toxicity in 1, during posaconazole prophylaxis). After a median follow-up of 5 months, overall survival (OS) was similar in pts with or without IFD (p=0.294), while in those not achieving CR after first induction it was significantly lower in pts developing IFD (p=0.03) (Fig. 1A and 1B). Conclusions. IFD is still a frequent complication during AML induction treatment, also in patients receiving AF prophylaxis; it is associated with a frequent discontinuation of M and to a worsening of OS in patients not in CR after the first induction, probably contributing to a delay in the appropriate timing of the AML treatment. A posaconazole-containing prophylaxis was a better strategy against IFD occurrence, compared to echinocandins alone. M discontinuation for toxicity was a relatively rare event and no specific relationship with the type of AF prophylaxis ongoing was observed. A study evaluating plasma M levels during different prophylaxis strategies adopted is ongoing within the SEIFEM group.
