    "abstract_text": "Introduction Erythracytapheresis (ER) can improve outcome in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). A good vascular access is required but can be difficult to obtain for sickle cells patients. Arterio-venous fistula (AVF) has been suggested for ER in SCD supported by limited evidence. We report the largest cohort of ER performed with AVF from three French sickle cell disease reference centers. Methods Data of SCD patients undergoing ER with AVF in the French SCD reference center were retrospectively collected. The inclusion criteria were: SS or S\u03b2-Thalassemia and AVF surgery for ER. AVF for hemodialysis were excluded. SCD-related complications, transfusion history, details about AVF surgical procedure, echocardiographic data before and after AVF, AVF-related surgical and hemodynamical complications were collected. Results Twenty-six patients (mean age 20.5 years; median follow-up 68 months [11; 279]) were included. Twenty-three patients (88.5%) required a central vascular access before AVF. Fifteen AVF (58%) were created on the forearm and 11 (42%) on the arm. Nineteen patients (73%) had stenotic, thrombotic or infectious AVF complications. The median AVF lifespan was 34 months [13; 66]. One patient with severe pulmonary hypertension worsened after AVF creation, and died. Conclusions We report the first series of SCD patients with AVF for ER demonstrating AVF could be considered as a potential vascular access for ER. Patients with increased risk for hemodynamic intolerance of AVF must be carefully identified, in order to consider alternative vascular accesses.
