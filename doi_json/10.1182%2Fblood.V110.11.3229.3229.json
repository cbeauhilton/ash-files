    "abstract_text": "We sought to develop a better understanding of the T cells involved in the human allogeneic immune response, in order to eventually engineer a donor graft with reduced GVHD-mediating potential, without ablating general immune competence. Prior studies reported that all the activated CD4 + T cells responding to a specific antigen challenge reside within the CD4 high population expressing high levels of membrane CD4. We identified a new population of activated CD8 + T cells that developed during an in vitro allogeneic immune response, along with the allo-activated CD4 high T cell population. Analogous to activated CD4 + T cells, this new T cell population was distinguished by up-regulated CD8 (and CD38) expression (CD8 high CD38 + ). In accordance with Martins et al. (Blood 2004, 104:3429), we found that the depletion of the CD4 high CD38 + population resulted in reduced 2 o response to the original 2 nd party stimulators. In contrast, depletion of the CD8 high CD38 + population resulted in an increased 2 o response to 2 nd party cells, with no change in the response to 3 rd party or CMV antigens. Elevated numbers of CD8 high CD38 + T cells potently reduced the 1 o and 2 o responses to 2 nd party, but not to 3 rd party cells or CMV antigens. The complementary, non-activated CD8 normal CD38 \u2212 T cell population had no inhibitory effect. Importantly, we found that CD8 high CD38 + T cells mediated both a specific cytotoxic response (that could be inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD), and a specific suppressive response toward the original 2 nd party stimulators (that was not affected by Z-VAD), and within this CD8 high CD38 + population, there was a subpopulation of cytotoxic T cells (perforin + LAMP1 + CD56 + CD11b + CD11c + ) and a subpopulation of non-cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, we found that although CD8 high CD38 + T cells differentially expressed CD28, both CD8 high CD38 + CD28 \u2212 and CD8 high CD38 + CD28 \u2212 T cells mediated a cytotoxic as well as a suppressor T cell response toward the original 2 nd party cells (different from the published suppressive function of CD8 + CD28 \u2212 T cells observed by Liu et al, Int Immunol 1998, 10:775). Upon separation of cytotoxic CD8 high CD38 + T cells from suppressor CD8 high CD38 + T cells, we will explore the GVHD potential of these 2 novel activated CD8 high T cell subpopulations, in a sensitive in vivo xenograft model for GVHD using NOD/SCID/IL2R\u03b3 null immunodeficient mice."
