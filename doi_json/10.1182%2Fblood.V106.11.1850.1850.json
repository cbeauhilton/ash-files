    "abstract_text": "Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO, Mylotarg\u00ae) is a humanized calicheamicin-conjugated monoclonal antibody targeted to the CD33 antigen (ag) present on myeloblasts. Phase 2 single agent trials have demonstrated a 28% response rate in acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) in first relapse. In these trials GO was used at a dose of 9 mg/m2 for two doses at 14 days interval. GO reaches its site of action by binding to CD33 ag with subsequent internalisation of the drug-receptor complex. A continuous renewed expression of CD33 ag on the cellular surface after a first exposure to GO was described. This observation led to hypothesize that treatment with frequent pulses exposures could facilitate intracellular drug loading and augment its cytotoxicity. Accordingly, we conducted a pilot study testing fractionated doses of GO, 3 mg/m2 administered at days 1, 4 and 7 for the induction course in 11 patients (pts) with poor prognosis AML. Analysis showed 4/11 (36%) responses and good haematological and liver tolerance. We decided to confirm these results in a phase 2 sequential non controlled trial, planned to detect a 15% benefit in response rate with Mylotarg\u00ae from the control rate of 15% (with type I and II error rate at 5% and 15%, respectively). Inclusion criteria were: de novo AML CD33+ adult pts in first early relapse with a duration of first remission < than 18 months. 56 pts were included between 11/12/03 and 24/07/05. At the second interim analysis, based on the first 26 pts the trial was stopped because of the crossing of the upper boundary, with the conclusion of benefit of Mylotarg\u00ae. Results of this second interim analysis: Median age was 65 years (22 to 75 years). Median duration of first remission was 9 months (4 to 18 mo). Karyotype was of intermediate risk in 17/24 (71%) pts and poor in 7. All pts received GO intravenously at a dose of 3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4 and 7. Response criteria were those of the revised criteria of NCI. Eight pts reached CR and two CRp (platelets below 100 10. 9 / L) for a total response rate of 10/26 (38.5%). Median time to ANC recovery to 0.5 10. 9 /L for CR and Crp pts was 24 days (10 to 38 days); median time to platelets recovery to 50 10. 9 /L for CR pts was 18 days (4 to 38 days); median number of red blood cells transfusions was 4 (0 to 18), median number of platelets transfusions was 4 (0 to 28). A transient rise in ASAT or ALAT or bilirubin (17 grade 1, 2 grade 2 and only 1 grade 4) was observed in 20/26 (77%) pts. No VOD was observed. Infections grade 3 were observed in 11 patients. All responders pts received consolidation chemotherapy with HD AraC. In summary: This study confirms that fractionated doses of GO allows to achieve response rate close to that observed in previous phase 2 studies, permits an early recovery of platelets and ANC, and has a low toxicity profile, leading to the possibility for all responsive patients to receive additional consolidation therapy. Final analysis with data of all patients and follow-up will be presented."
