    "abstract_text": "Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality frequently associated with activation of the coagulation system. Reduced levels of protein C are found in the majority of patients with sepsis and are associated with an increased risk of death. Although activated protein C is indicated for the treatment of severe sepsis in adults, the risk of severe bleeding may limit its use in neonates. Because the likelihood of inducing bleeding with the zymogen form of protein C is reduced we assessed both human and murine protein C zymogen in a murine neonatal sepsis model. In this model neonatal mice were challenged with viable group B streptococci (GBS). The effect of this septic condition on endogenous protein C levels was evaluated and the effect of treatment with either recombinant murine protein C or human plasma-derived (non-activated) protein C (Ceprotin) investigated. During severe GBS sepsis murine endogenous protein C levels decreased over time in neonatal mice, resulting in a maximum decrease of \u221230 % at 16 hours after GBS challenge and returned towards baseline at 30 hours. Concomitantly, there was an increase in endogenous protein C activation up to 59 % at 6 hours after GBS challenge, returning to baseline levels at 16 hours. Blocking endogenous murine protein C with an anti-mouse monoclonal antibody increased the mortality rate significantly from 62 to 91 %. Treatment of neonatal septic mice (n=36) with 300 U/kg murine protein C subcutaneously 4 hours before GBS challenge decreased the mortality rate significantly in severe sepsis (LD90) to 64 % (p=0.002). Similarly pretreatment with human plasma-derived protein C (200 IU/kg) 4 hours before GBS challenge increased survival rate significantly in severe septic mice. Treatment with 200 IU/kg (Ceprotin) was even effective given 18 hours after GBS challenge, leading to a decrease in the mortality rate in severe sepsis from 87.5 to 48 %. Despite this species difference and the septic condition, human protein C zymogen was activated to activated protein C and detectable in the circulation of mice. This is the first preclinical study were a beneficial effect of a non-activated protein C could be shown in an animal model of severe neonatal sepsis."
