    "abstract_text": "Background: The IL-3 receptor CD123 is an attractive target for antibody-based therapies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) because of its frequent expression on AML blasts and its reported overexpression on leukemic stem cells (LSCs) as compared to normal hematopoietic tissues. Previously, two CD123 x CD3 bispecific targeting ADAPTIR constructs (APVO436 and APVO437) have been shown to bind CD123 with high affinity, engage T-cells and, in the presence of effector T-cells, cause cytotoxicity in CD123-expressing cell lines as well as in an in vivo xenograft model. Here, we further investigated the determinants of anti-tumor efficacy of these constructs in human AML. Materials and Methods: Frozen aliquots of Ficoll-isolated mononuclear cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow specimens were obtained from adults with AML. CD123 expression on myeloblasts and cells lines and the percentage of endogenous CD3 + T-cells in AML specimens were quantified by flow cytometry. To determine specific cytotoxicity, cell lines or primary AML cells were incubated in culture medium containing various concentrations of ADAPTIR constructs APVO436 and APVO437. Exogenous T-cells isolated from healthy volunteers were labeled with CellVue membrane dye and added at different effector:target (E:T) cell ratios. After 48 hours, cell numbers and drug-induced cytotoxicity, using DAPI to detect non-viable cells, were determined by flow cytometry; target AML cells were identified by forward/side scatter properties and negativity for CellVue dye. Specific cytotoxicity was calculated as: 100 x (%DAPI treated - %DAPI control )/(100-%DAPI control ) and are presented as mean\u00b1SEM of all samples tested. T-cell activation, proliferation and depletion of CD123 + cell populations in normal and AML specimens were assessed using multi-color flow cytometry. Results: We examined the ability of APVO436 and APVO437 to induce cytotoxicity in primary human AML specimens. Of 20 samples tested, 10 had both >60% viability on thaw and >40% viability after 48 hours in cultures and were included for further analysis. The median percentage of myeloid blasts and CD3 + T-cells in the analyzed specimens was 78.5% (range 52-91.7%) and 2.95% (range 0.3-8.8%). With no exogenous T-cells, APVO436 and APVO437 induced modest cytotoxicity; at 1000 pM, APVO436 and APVO437 induced specific cytotoxicity of 6.8\u00b13.8% and 3.9\u00b13.6%, respectively. There was no statistically significant correlation between the percentage of endogenous T-cells present in the sample and the amount of cytotoxicity in the absence of exogenous T-cells. The addition of healthy donor T-cells increased cytotoxicity in a E:T-dependent manner (p <0.0001 for both APVO436 and APVO437) and increasing drug concentrations also increased cytotoxicity in a statistically-significant fashion (p <0.0001 for both APVO436 and APVO437). There was no consistent linear relationship between MFI CD123 of blasts (MFI CD123 , arbitrary units) and cytotoxicity. Significant cytotoxicity was achieved even at the lowest levels of blast CD123 expression (MFI CD123 range among patient samples: 349-3423). Inclusion of all 20 samples in cytotoxicity analysis did not qualitatively change results. APVO436 induced T-cell activation in both normal and AML samples at 24 hours as assessed by quantification of CD25 and CD69 expressing T-cells. T-cell activation was accompanied by proliferation of T-cells in normal and AML specimens at 96 hours in the presence of APVO436. APVO436 induced dose dependent depletion of CD123 + cells which was evident at 24 hours in both normal and AML samples. Conclusion: APVO436 and APVO437 cause target cell cytolysis in a dose-dependent, target-antigen-dependent, and E:T-dependent manner. Broad activity was seen in primary human AML samples and both constructs were effective in inducing cytotoxicity across a range of blast CD123 expression levels, including specimens with very limited CD123 expression. Endogenous T-cell activation and proliferation accompanied by CD123 + cell depletion demonstrate similar activity of anti-CD123 x anti-CD3 ADAPTIRs in both normal and AML subject samples. These data are supportive of further investigation of anti-CD123 x anti-CD3 ADAPTIR molecules as a potential treatment option for AML.
