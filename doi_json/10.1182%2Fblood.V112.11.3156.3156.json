    "abstract_text": "Background: Normal and tumor stem cells are characterized by high activity of multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters. One of these, ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G member 2 protein), is an ATP dependent transporter and putative stem cell marker responsible for verapamil sensitive Hoechst efflux. While ABCG2 is known to be expressed in normal and leukemic stem cells, as well as a small population of normal lymphocytes and some B-cell malignancies, its expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is unknown. It has been postulated that leukemic stem cells due to their quiescent nature and expression of MDR transporters represent a population resistant to therapy and that this residual population is critical for tumor persistence and recurrence. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that ABCG2 is expressed in a small percentage of primary CLL B cells; gene expression profiles of ABCG2 positive versus ABCG2 negative CLL B cells differ in respect to expression of self renewal and lymphoid development genes; the frequency of ABCG2+ CLL B cells increases after treatment in patients responding to therapy. Methods: We analyzed ABCG2 expression by primary CD5+, CD19+ CLL-B cells from untreated CLL patients of all Rai stages by flow cytometry. In a subset of patients we used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to sort CD19+, CD5+ ABCG2+ and CD19+, CD5+ ABCG2- cells. Gene expression profiling was then performed using the U133 plus 2.0 Affymetrix microarray platform. In a separate cohort of patients treated in a clinical trial of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (PCR), the percentage of ABCG2+, CD19+, CD5+, CD79b dim cells at baseline and then two months after completion of 6 cycles of PCR therapy where patients had minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed and correlated with clinical response. Results: ABCG2+ CD19+, CD5+ detectable populations were seen in all 20 CLL assessed patients (median percentage 0.6%; range 0.08%\u20133.8%). There was no difference in percentage of ABCG2+ cells based on Rai stage, IGVH mutational status, Zap70 or CD38 expression. Preliminary analysis of the gene expression profiling of ABCG2 positive versus negative CLL B cells from four randomly selected patients revealed significantly higher expression of genes associated with self-renewal, cell cycle and early B-cell development including: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (CDKN1C, p=0.034), transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2, involved in WNT pathway regulation, p=0.016), beta-catenin (p=0.034) and pre-B-cell colony enhancing factor 1 (PBEF-1, p=0.037). Flow based assessment of the levels of ABCG2 positive populations at baseline and after therapy with PCR in patients with minimal residual disease showed a dramatic increase in frequency of ABCG2 positive CLL B cells. The percentage of ABCG2+ cells went from a median level of 0.19% (range 0.04%\u20130.19%) prior to therapy to a median level of 10.93% (range 0.15%\u201325.12%), p<0.001. In contrast two patients who did not reach MRD (partial responses by NCI-WG criteria) had no significant increase in percentage of ABCG2 positive cells (0.14%; 0.23% and 0.16%; 0.21% prior and after therapy, respectively, p=0.68). Conclusion: Our data indicate that ABCG2 positive CLL B-cells constitute 0.1\u20133.8% of circulating CLL B-cells in untreated patients. The frequency of ABCG2+ CLL B-cells appears to dramatically increase after therapy in the MRD state; this could be related to their relative resistance to therapy and/or a shift from extravascular compartments post therapy. Since ABCG2 positive CLL B-cells demonstrate expression of early B-cell development and self-renewal genes we believe that that this population could represent a putative self renewing CLL B-cell compartment. Further studies to characterize features of ABCG2 CLL-B \u2013cells in relation to their capacity to be self renewing and resistance to therapy are warranted.",
