    "abstract_text": "Severe post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is responsible for considerable disability, reduced quality of life and increased health care costs. Current therapies are limited and often ineffective. Methods: We performed a two-center, randomized, cross-over controlled trial to evaluate Venowave \u2122 , a novel lower-limb venous return assist device, for the treatment of severe PTS. Eligible subjects were allocated to receive, in randomized order, Venowave \u2122 for 8 weeks and control-device for 8 weeks. Participants were crossed-over after a 4-week (wash-out) period. The primary outcome measure was a clinical success, defined as; 1) reported benefit from the device with; 2) moderate (or greater) improvement in symptoms of PTS; and 3) willingness to continue using the device long-term. Secondary outcome measures included venous disease-specific quality of life (QOL) (measured by VEINES-QOL questionnaire; higher scores indicate better QOL) and PTS severity (measured by the Villalta PTS scale; higher scores indicate more severe PTS). The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT00182208 ). Results: Thirty-two patients were enrolled. Of these, 26 (80%) were also using graduated compression stockings. Twenty-six participants completed both trial periods. The primary outcome measure occurred in 10 participants receiving Venowave and 4 participants receiving the control-device (P=0.1). Two participants reported a clinical success with both devices. Mean Villalta scale score at the end of treatment period was significantly lower for Venowave \u2122 (12.2; SD 6.3) compared to control (15.0; SD 6.1). (P=0.004) Mean VEINES-QOL score at the end of treatment period was significantly greater for Venowave \u2122 (52.5; SD 5.8) compared to control (50.2; SD 6.2). (P=0.004) Conclusions: Venowave \u2122 is a very promising new therapy for patients with severe PTS, which may be used alone or in combination with graduated compression stockings. In our study population of patients with severe PTS, refractory to standard therapies, almost one-third of patients reported clinical improvement with Venowave \u2122 ."
