    "abstract_text": "Background: Minimal residual disease (MRD) detection is of high clinical relevance in patients with B-cell malignancies and is generally a surrogate parameter to evaluate treatment response and long-term prognosis. IgH gene rearrangements can be used as molecular marker in approximately 80% of lymphoma and myeloma patients since they represent lineage-specific markers and the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) is unique to each clone. To date, allele specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) are considered the most sensitive and widely applicable methods for MRD detection. A major disadvantage of ASO-PCR and RQ-PCR assays, is the use of specific primers and probes for every individual patient. Clone-specific primers and probes are not only expensive but also time-consuming to design and to test, which limits their wide applicability in the clinical setting. The recent major improvements in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, provide the opportunity to identify and quantify clonotypes with consensus primers combining the benefits of high sensitivity and universal applicability. The present work was designed to overcome ASO-PCR and RQ-PCR limitations by developing a feasible method for rearranged IgH genes amplification, NGS and analysis using Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (IT-PGM) . Methods: To define a multiplex PCR protocol, DNA from 7 CLL patients, previously shown to bare a family specific clonal VDJ rearrangement, was amplified with a pool of the seven different family-specific IgH-V primers, and a consensus JH primer (Voena et al., Leukemia 1997 ). After Sanger sequencing, results were compared to the ones obtained with singleplex PCR protocol. Once validated, the multiplex PCR protocol was used to amplify DNA from patients and serially diluted (up to 10 -8 ) DNA from Namalwa cell line (bearing a known IgH rearrangement) and subsequently sequenced on the IT-PGM using the 316 Ion-chip. NGS data were analyzed by using the IMGT-High V-Quest web server tool and the statistical software R. RQ-PCR was used to quantify the specific VDJ rearrangement in the serially diluted Namalwa DNA solutions and in DNA from patients as previously described (Farina et al, Haematologica 2009). RQ-PCR data were analyzed through a relative quantification procedure. Results: The multiplex PCR reactions we have tested, demonstrated the same specificity as the standard singleplex PCR protocol and therefore was used to construct the DNA library required for IT-PGM-based sequencing. The IT-PGM sequencing output is represented by at least 400000 reads per sample with a minimum average coverage of the VDJ repertoire of 500x. The IMGT-High V-quest tool allows a user-friendly web based analysis and a deep molecular characterization of the IgH recombinatorial repertoire. Namalwa clonal CRD3 sequences were detected up to a dilution of 10 -5 without the need for specific CDR3 primers. Comparability of NGS and ASO RQ-PCR results was assessed. The use of CDR3 specific primers, along with the specific IgH-V family fluorescent probe, enabled the identification of clonal VDJ rearrangements with a sensitivity up to 10 -5 (2/3 replicates) and 10 -6 (just 1/3 replicates) in Namalwa Cell Line. Similar results were obtained when we characterized the IgH recombination repertoire of two CLL patients over time. Conclusions: IgH sequencing with the IT-PGM platform showed at least the same level of sensitivity as ASO RQ-PCR, without the need for patient-specific reagents. It also allows specific and detailed molecular characterization of the clonal rearrangements and could be easily incorporated into clinical laboratories for routine testing of MRD in B-cell malignancies.
