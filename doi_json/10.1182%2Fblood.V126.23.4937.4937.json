    "abstract_text": "PURPOSE: Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is a very effective drug for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, little has been reported concerning its use as front-line therapy for complete remission of newly diagnosed APL with t(15;17) chromosomal abnormality. METHODS: The adult patients newly diagnosed with APL with t(15;17) chromosomal abnormality (which would invariably lead to a positive PML/RAR alpha fusion gene) were received 4-5 weeks of ATO administered intravenous drip at a daily dose of 10mg(concentration 2%)/day as induced chemotherapy. When a complete remission was achieved by the ATO induction, a three weeks interval would be observed, after which 5 + 3 days of maintenance (with cytarabine and anthracycline, respectively) would be carried out. A further interval of 2 weeks would then take place, after which all-trans retinoic (ATRA) would be administered oral for another 2 weeks. A final interval of 2 weeks after the administration of ATRA would take place before a recurrence of the chemotherapy regimen, which would restart again with ATO induction. After PML/RAR alpha fusion gene Q-PCR tested negative, the regimen would continue recurring, ensuring negativity of the gene for 2 years. After 2 years the regimen would end, and PML/RAR alpha fusion gene of the patients were to be observed/monitored once every 3-6 months for 10 years. Central nervous system leukemia (CNSL), which might be caused by APL, was to be prevented by lumbar punctures chemotherapy once every 6-8 weeks after complete remission of the patients. Six times were taken. RESULTS: Out of 496 for newly diagnosed APL from 2005 to 2015, we identified 113 patients as newly diagnosed APL. All patients achieved complete response after treatment with ATO induced chemotherapy. Sixty-two out of 65 (95.38%) patients with APL were cured with ATO induction and subsequent 5 + 3 maintenance (cytarabine and anthracycline) therapy from 2005 to 2010. The other three patients were relapsed or had refractory disease and then died. Forty-six out of 48 patients (95.83%) achieved complete cytogenetic remission from 2011 to 2015. The other two patients were relapsed or had refractory disease and then died. All patients had no serious adverse events. Five patients had dyspnea, fever, weight gain, peripheral edema and were successfully treated with dexamethason and furosemide. CONCLUSIONS: Arsenic trioxide is a very effective drug as the front-line therapy for newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
