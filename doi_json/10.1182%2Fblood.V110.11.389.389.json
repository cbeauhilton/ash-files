    "abstract_text": "Background: As MCL has a continuous relapse pattern with current treatments, we designed a study to determine the safety and efficacy of the anti-CD20 radio-immunoconjugate, 90 Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan ( 90 Y-RIT), following 4 cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) induction. Methods: Patients (pt) with untreated stage II-IV MCL (CD20+, cyclin D1+) \u226518 yr with measurable/evaluable disease and adequate organ function were eligible. At 4\u20138 weeks after 4 cycles of R-CHOP, responding (CR/PR) and stable pt received 0.4 mCi/kg 90 Y-RIT. The primary endpoint was failure-free survival (FFS) and secondary objectives were evaluation of response and toxicity after R-CHOP and after 90 Y-RIT. The study design required 52 eligible pt to demonstrate a prolongation of FFS by 50% compared with R-CHOP alone (median FFS 16 mo, Howard et al., JCO  20 : 1288 , 2002 ). Results: The characteristics of 56 eligible pt are: 73% male, median age 61 (33\u201383) yrs, 91% stage III/IV, 68% >1 extranodal site, 78% marrow-positive. IPI was 0\u20132 in 51%, 3\u20135 in 49%. Fifty-one (91%) pt received all treatment and best response (n=50) was 42% CR/CRu, 32% PR, 12% stable and 4% unevaluable, with an improvement in response in 16 pt after 90 Y-RIT. After 90 Y-RIT, 55% had grade 3/4 neutropenia with no febrile neutropenia and 45% had grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia with recovery at 12 weeks in 22/23 pt. Median follow-up (all pt) is 24.4 months. Median FFS for all 56 pt is 27 months with an estimated 71% FFS and 93% overall survival at 18 months. Among pt who completed all treatment and have been followed \u22651.5 yr (n=45), 33 remain failure-free and 12 have progressed (4 dead). Conclusions: 90 Y RIT after 4 cycles of R-CHOP in untreated MCL is safe and improves the number and quality of responses. These data suggest prolongation of FFS over that expected with R-CHOP alone. Consolidation of remission in MCL with 90Y-RIT shows potential as a strategy to prolong remission duration and is applicable to most pt with MCL. However, longer follow-up in needed to evaluate the durability of remissions achieved.",
