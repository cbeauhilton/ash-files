    "abstract_text": "The TP53 pathway has been shown to be dysregulated in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) through several different mechanisms, including TP53 mutations, TP53 deletions and Murine Double Minute 2 (MDM2) overexpression. Downregulation of the TP53 pathway likely plays a role in MPN progression as evidenced by the association of TP53 loss of heterozygosity with transformation to acute leukemia and the presence of inactivating mutations of TP53 found in a proportion of MPN-blast phase (MPN-BP) cases (Kubesova et al, Leukemia. 2018;32(2):450-61). Furthermore, MDM2 inhibition induces TP53 pathway upregulation and consequent targeting of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in polycythemia vera (PV) and myelofibrosis (MF). The MDM2 inhibitor, idasanutlin, has shown activity in a Phase I trial of high-risk PV patients (Mascarenhas et al. Blood . 2019 Jun 5). An additional regulator of TP53 is protein phosphatase, Mg 2+ /Mn 2+ dependent 1D (PPM1D) which by dephosphorylating TP53 and stabilizing MDM2 regulates the DNA damage response pathway and apoptosis. Somatic activating mutations of PPM1D are present in both solid and hematologic malignancies and are specifically associated with therapy-related myeloid disorders (Hsu et al. Cell Stem Cell . 2018 Nov 1;23(5):700-13). Grinfeld et al. ( N Engl J Med. 2018 Oct 11;379(15):1416-30) recently reported that in their genomic analysis of 2035 MPN patients, PPM1D was the eighth most common mutated gene in MPNs at 1.9% frequency. To determine whether there was an association of PPM1D mutations with MPNs we analyzed the genomic data of patients who participated in several clinical trials executed by the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Research Consortium (MPN-RC). Of 89 MPN-BP patients, 5 patients harbored a PPM1D mutation with a median variant allele frequency (VAF) of 17%. In comparison, 4 out of 135 high risk PV and ET patients harbored a PPM1D mutation with a median VAF of 24%. All mutations were truncating which is consistent with previous reports of PPMID mutations in malignancies. The PPM1D gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q23.2) and we hypothesized that cytogenetic aberrations involving this gene locus might also contribute to abnormalities of PPM1D function. Through analysis of our cytogenetic database, 16/1,124 (1.4%) MPN patients were found to have cytogenomic abnormalities involving the region containing the PPM1D gene. Eight of these patients had karyotypic abnormalities, including 3 pts with isochromosome 17q resulting in a gain of 17q and a loss of 17p, including the TP53 gene. The other 4 patients had structural variations of 17q which might lead to aberrant expression of PPM1D . One patient by FISH analysis had gain of 17q. Ten patients had cytogenomic aberrations of 17q detected through analysis of array comparative genomic hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism (aCGH+SNP), 2 of which had concurrent karyotypic abnormalities of 17q. All patients had a gain or copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH) of the 17q22-24.2 region. CnLOH of this region could lead to aberrant overexpression of the PPM1D gene. One of the 8 patients with cnLOH of 17q harbored a PPM1D mutation. Of the 16 patients with 17q cytogenomic abnormalities, 7 (44%) had MPN-BP and 7 (44%) patients had ET or ET that progressed to myelofibrosis (MF) or MPN-BP indicating an association of these abnormalities with advanced disease. By quantitative real time-PCR we determined the PPM1D transcript levels in mononuclear cells from 31 MPN patients without known PPM1D mutations (7 polycythemia vera (PV), 6 ET, 14 MF, 4 MPN-BP) and compared the transcript levels to mononuclear cells from healthy control patients. Forty-two percent (13/31) patients had overexpression of PPM1D (>1.5 fold increase range). Fold increase ranged from 1.5-8 and overexpression was present in the following diagnoses: 4/7 PV, 1/6 ET, 8/14 MF and 0/4 MPN-BP. We have provided evidence that a number of abnormalities of PPM1D including activating mutations, cytogenetic aberrations and transcript overexpression are present in a significant proportion of MPN patients. These abnormalities in PPM1D can be additional events that lead to the downregulation of TP53 and contribute to MPN disease progression. We propose that inhibitors of PPM1D may be used in combination with other drugs that upregulate TP53 to treat MPN patients.
