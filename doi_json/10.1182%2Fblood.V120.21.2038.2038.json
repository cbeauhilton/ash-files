    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2038 Background: Cytogenetic abnormalities in leukemic blasts at time of diagnosis are the most important prognostic factors in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). However, approximately 50% of patients (pts) with AML have normal cytogenetics (NC-AML). Within this population, the presence of somatic mutations further refines the prognosis. Mutations such as the internal tandem duplication of FLT-3 (FLT-3 ITD), and mutations in NPM1 and IDH1 have been all been shown to have significant prognostic value in determining response to chemotherapy and overall survival (OS). FLT-3 ITD is present in approximately 30% of pts with NC-AML and is considered the most significant predictor of poor prognosis following chemotherapy. However, it is not clear whether the presence of FLT-3 ITD influences the outcome of patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). We therefore performed a retrospective analysis of all adult patients with NC-AML and FLT-3 ITD present at time of diagnosis who underwent HSCT at MSKCC between 2007 and 2012. Methods: A total of 196 pts with AML underwent HSCT during this period. For this analysis, we excluded 112 pts with abnormal cytogenetics, 5 pts who had no cytogenetic testing performed, and 27 pts with normal cytogenetics who did not have molecular analysis performed. Results: A total of 52 pts with normal cytogenetics had molecular testing done; of these, 35 were FLT-3 negative (67%) and 17 were FLT-3 positive (33%). Characteristics of the 2 groups are shown below:  . FLT-3 Negative (n=35) . FLT-3 Positive (n=17) .

We conclude that in this relatively small group of pts (1) HSCT appears to overcome the negative prognostic effect of FLT-3 ITD and (2) use of a T cell depleted graft does not influence transplant outcomes. A larger cooperative group analysis will be needed to confirm these findings. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
