    "abstract_text": "CD20 is highly expressed on normal and malignant B cells, and is a well-established target of antibody therapeutics for B cell leukemias and lymphomas. However, a limitation of approved anti-CD20 antibodies such as rituximab, ofatumumab, and obinutuzumab is that they are unable to stimulate T cell-mediated killing of CD20+ B cells. To exploit the potent activity intrinsic to T cell immunotherapy while maintaining the favorable dosing regimen of a therapeutic antibody, we have designed novel humanized bispecific antibodies that bind to both CD20+ B cells and CD3+ T cells. Such antibodies act via a mechanism known as \"redirected T cell-cytotoxicity\" (RTCC), because they stimulate targeted T cell-mediated killing regardless of T cell receptor antigen specificity. Unlike other bispecific formats, these antibodies possess a full Fc domain and spontaneously form stable heterodimers that are readily manufactured. Their Fc domain was also engineered to abolish binding to Fc\u03b3 receptors (to reduce the potential for nonselective T cell activation), yet preserve binding to human FcRn (to maintain long serum half-life). We first generated a series of affinity-optimized anti-CD20 \u00d7 anti-CD3 bispecific antibodies and screened these using RTCC assays in which bispecifics stimulated killing of the CD20+ Ramos B cell line by purified human T cells. From this cell-based screen, we selected two candidates for further study in animal models. The bispecific antibodies XmAb13676 and XmAb13677 have identical T cell-engaging domains with 8 nM affinity for human CD3. XmAb13676 stimulated T cell killing of Ramos cells with an EC50 of ~53 ng/ml (~420 pM), while XmAb13677 (with higher affinity for CD20) had an EC50 of ~2 ng/ml (~16 pM). To assess in vivo half-life, we next dosed mice with 2 mg/kg of XmAb13676 or XmAb13677. In marked contrast to non-Fc domain-containing bispecific antibody formats, XmAb13676 and XmAb13677 had an extended serum half-life in mice of 6.7 and 6.6 days, respectively. Because these bispecifics were optimized for binding to human CD20 and CD3 targets and do not crossreact with mouse antigens, we evaluated efficacy in cynomolgus monkeys. We treated 3 monkeys per group with a single dose of XmAb13676 or XmAb13677 at 0.03, 0.3, or 3 mg/kg. Within 4 hr after dosing, T cells were strongly activated and stimulated depletion of over 97% of circulating CD40+ B cells, with the two 3 mg/kg groups showing greatest depletion. B cells continued to decrease for 24 to 48 hr after dosing, with the high-dose groups remaining at baseline levels for the duration of the study (29 days). CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the circulation were activated immediately after treatment with XmAb13676 and XmAb13677, and this state was sustained for over 48 hr, as measured by greatly increased levels of the activation markers CD25 and CD69. Bispecific antibodies also induced rapid margination of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from the circulation, with blood T cell populations returning to baseline from 2 to 7 days after dosing. Notably, CD40+ cells in lymph nodes and in bone marrow were depleted by over 90% at all doses, and at the higher dose levels, these B cell populations had not recovered by 29 days after treatment. Our results demonstrate that bispecific antibodies can recruit and activate T cells to efficiently kill CD20+ B cells not only in the circulation but also in the more resistant reservoir of lymphoid organs. These preclinical data in cynomolgus monkeys provide a rationale for clinical assessment of anti-CD20 \u00d7 anti-CD3 bispecific antibodies in patients with CD20+ B cell leukemias and lymphomas.
