    "abstract_text": "The relapse post ABMT is a terminal stage complication in HD. The allogenic transplant contributes to a different therapeutic approach through the immune anti tumor effect of the Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) The NST variant of the procedure diminishes the risks of transplant related mortality (TRM) and is associated with induction of mixed hematopoietic chimerism when either HLA-identical sibling or unrelated donor are used, and that powerful GVT effects can be achieved against advanced chemotherapy/resistant hematology disease. The feasibility, risk and effectiveness of the NST, is analyzed in 13 patients with relapsed HD after ABMT. Seven women and six men with a median age of 26 years old. They had received \u2265 of 3 therapeutic lines that included the high doses and the ABMT. The period betwen the diagnosis to NST, had a median time of 36 months. The patients were conditioned with Fludarabine based schemes plus: Melphalan 8, Cyclofosfamide 3, TBI 1, Busulfan 1. The sources of stem cells were, with a HLA-identical sibiling donors in 12 patients, and in 1 with non related donor. 4 patients died due to complications associated with the BMT (TRM 28 %): shock 2, sepsis 1, thrombotic microangiophaty 1. Half of the patients developed some form of GVHD, or it was induced by donor lymphocytes infusion. With an average follow up of 15 months (range: 1\u201356), 7 patients are alive, 5 of them developed GVHD and are in CR, the other 2 have a short follow up (28 and 75 days). Of 4 patients who progressed only 1 present GVHD. The NST is a feasible procedure in HD relapsed post ABMT. The TRM is 28 %. In this group there is a clear relationship between the control of HD and the appearance of GVHD."
