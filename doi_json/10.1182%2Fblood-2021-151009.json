    "abstract_text": "Background Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is formally classified as advanced, smoldering (SSM), or indolent (ISM). Advanced SM indicates the presence of an associated non-mast cell lineage hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN) or at least one \"C finding\" (i.e. features of organopathy from mast cell infiltration); the latter defines aggressive SM (ASM). Both advanced SM and ISM might be associated with MC mediator symptoms (MC-MSs) or urticaria pigmentosa (UP). Current drug therapy for SM is primarily directed at reversing C findings or alleviating symptoms/UP, and includes cladribine, midostaurin, and avapritinib. The former has a long track-record of safety while the latter two are recent additions that target the associated KIT mutation, but with concerning gastrointestinal and neurological side effects. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with cladribine therapy in SM, in order to maintain a proper perspective in making treatment choices. Methods The current study includes 42 patients with SM (22 advanced and 20 indolent/smoldering), recruited from the Mayo Clinic SM database, based on documentation of treatment with cladribine. Conventional criteria were used for diagnosis and classification ( Blood 2016;127:2391 ) and definitions of response ( Eur J Clin Invest. 2007 Jun;37(6):435 ); in the latter regard, we utilized modified Valent criteria that incorporated a minimum of one-month duration to qualify as response. Results Advanced SM: 22 patients (median age 65 years, range 48-80; males 68%) had advanced SM, including 13 SM-AHN, 8 ASM, and 1 mast cell leukemia. Median (range) BM MC burden was 30% (10%-90%), serum tryptase 193 ng/ml (21-1370), hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL (7-15), leukocytes 6 x 10(9)/L (0.5-63), and platelets 115 x 10(9)/L (8-320). KIT D816V was detected in 86% of 19 evaluated and abnormal karyotype in 14% of 21 evaluated. 50% of patients had palpable hepatomegaly, 59% palpable splenomegaly, 100% MC-MSs, and 14% UP; 87% displayed at least one C finding. Median time from BM biopsy confirmed diagnosis to initiation of cladribine therapy was 1.5 months (range 0.1-17). 55% of patients received at least 3 cycles of treatment. Overall response (OR) was documented in 17 (77%) patients with similar OR rates in ASM (88%) vs SM-AHN (69%; p=0.32), with median time to response of 3.7 months (range 0.4-9). OR included 45% major response (MR) and 32% partial response (PR). 17 patients were evaluated for BM MC response with 44% showing >50% reduction, in MCs, including 19% with complete resolution. Organomegaly response was complete in 36% and partial in 27%. Tryptase response of >50% was documented in 32%. Cladribine side effects were limited to cytopenias with 36% showing grade 3 or 4 myeloid cytopenia. Median duration of response was 6 months (range 1-67). Six patients, including 5 with SM-AHN, progressed to either AML or MCL. Among the 5 patients who did not respond to cladribine, one with ASM was successfully treated with midostaurin. Indolent or smoldering SM : 20 patients (median age 56 years, range 36-73; males 45%) had ISM (n=17) or SSM (n=3). Median (range) BM MC burden was 13% (5%-60%) and serum tryptase level 49 ng/ml (14-1630). KIT D816V was detected in 95% of 19 evaluated patients and abnormal karyotype in 12% of 17 evaluated. All patients displayed MC-MSs and 46% UP. Median time from BM biopsy confirmed diagnosis to initiation of cladribine therapy was 4 months (range 0-92). 85% of patients received at least 3 cycles of cladribine therapy. OR was documented in 14 (70%) patients, including 60% complete or major regression of symptoms or UP, with median time to maximal response of 8.5 months (range 1-98); response rates in patients with UP were similar with 57% complete or major regression; 10 patients were evaluable for BM MC response with 50% showing >50% reduction in MC burden. Serum tryptase response was evaluated in 13 patients with 46% showing >50% reduction in levels. Treatment-emergent cladribine side effects were limited to cytopenias with only 3 (15%) patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 myeloid cytopenia and (n=3; 15%) and 6 (30%) experiencing grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia. Conclusions : The current study confirms the favorable side effect profile and long-term safety of cladribine as a first-line drug of choice for both indolent and advanced SM. Response to cladribine therapy was evident in all aspects of the disease, including MC-associated organopathy, UP, MC-MSs, serum tryptase level and bone marrow MC burden.
