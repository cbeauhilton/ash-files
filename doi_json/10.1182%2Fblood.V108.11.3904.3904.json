    "abstract_text": "2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is a naturally occurring monoglyceride that activates cannabinoid receptors and meets several key requisites of an endogenous cannabinoid substance. It is present in the brain and hematopoietic cells, including macrophages, lymphocytes and platelets. 2-AG is released from cells in a stimulus-dependent manner and is rapidly eliminated by uptake into cells and enzymatic hydrolysis in arachidonic acid and glycerol. 2-AG might exert a very fine control on platelet function either through mechanisms intertwining with the signal transduction pathways used by platelet agonists or through mechanisms modulating specific receptors. The aim of this study was to define the role of 2-AG in human platelets and characterize the mechanisms by which it performs its action. Platelets from healthy donors were isolated from plasma by differential centrifugations and gel-filtration on Sepharose 2B. The samples were incubated with 2-AG (10\u2013100 \u03bcM) under constant stirring in the presence or absence of various inhibitors. Platelet aggregation was measured by Born technique. We have found that stimulation of human platelets with 2-AG induced irreversible aggregation, which was significantly enhanced by co-stimulation with ADP (1\u201310 \u03bcM). Furthermore, 2-AG-dependent platelet aggregation was completely inhibited by ADP scavengers, aspirin, and Rho kinase inhibitor, as well as by antagonists of the 2-AG receptor (CB2), of the ADP P2Y12 receptor, and of the thromboxane A 2 receptor. We further investigated the role of endocannabinoids on calcium mobilization. Intracellular [Ca 2+ ] was measured using FURA-2-loaded platelets prewarmed at 37\u00b0C under gentle stirring in a spectrofluorimeter. 2-AG induced rapid increase of cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was partially blocked by ADP scavengers and CB2 receptor antagonists. Furthermore, 2-AG-induced [Ca 2+ ] mobilization was totally suppressed by aspirin or the thromboxane A 2 receptor antagonist. These results suggest that 2-AG is able to trigger platelet activation, and that this action is partially mediated by CB2 receptor and ADP. Furthmore, 2-AG-dependent platelet activation is totally dependent on thromboxane A 2 generation."
