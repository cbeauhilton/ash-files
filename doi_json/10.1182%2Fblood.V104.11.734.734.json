    "abstract_text": "Objective: To evaluate risk factors, clinical manifestations and outcome of hyperacute or early acute graft-versus host disease (GVHD), defined as that occurring within 14 days after hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. Methods: A total of 815 consecutive patients transplanted at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center between 1/1998 and 9/2002 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Of 381 patients presenting with acute GVHD, 22% (n=83) had biopsy-proven hyperacute GVHD. Grade I GVHD occurred in 12% of these patients, grade II in 53%, grade III in 13% and grade IV in 22%. The proportion of grade II-IV GVHD in this group was significantly higher (88%) than in the 298 patients presenting with acute GVHD between days 15 and 100 (64%, p value 5) chemotherapy regimens before transplant. Age, disease status, GVHD prophylaxis, or stem cell source (BM vs peripheral HSC) were not associated with hyperacute GVHD. Overall mortality was significantly higher within 6 months post transplant for patients with hyperacute GVHD (HR=2.2, p value <0.001) compared to all other patients, or to patients developing acute GVHD after day 14 (HR=1.6, p = 0.009). GVHD-related death was also significantly higher (HR=2.3, p=0.007) in the hyperacute GVHD group. Conclusions: Hyperacute GVHD occurs in a substantial proportion of patients undersgoing HSC transplant, even prior to neutrophil engraftment. Skin involvement, grades 3\u20134 GVHD and a higher mortality are common features of this syndrome . Patients at high risk or with a diagnosis of hyperacute GVHD should be included in clinical studies whenever possible.",
