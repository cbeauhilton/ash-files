    "abstract_text": "The pathophysiology of cGVHD still remains unclear. To gain more insight into the immunological mechanism of cGVHD, we examined surface marker and cytokine production of peripheral blood T cells from 19 patients in the chronic phase of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The median age of patients was 31 years (range 13\u201347 years). The median days from allo-HSCT to examination was 43 months (range 17\u201394 months). Ten patients in whom 6 have treated with immunosuppressive agents and 4 without them developed chronic GVHD, whereas 9 patients in whom 5 have treated with immunosuppressive agents and 4 without them did not develop chronic GVHD. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were extracted from patients and 10 healthy volunteers, followed by isolation into CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. The analysis of surface marker and intracellular cytokine production of these cells was performed using fluorescence activated cell sorter. The percentage of IFN-g-producing CD8+ T cells among CD8+ T cells was significantly higher in patients with or without cGVHD than in healthy volunteers (p<0.001). Since all 19 patients were in remission, the IFN-g-producing CD8+ T cells might be related to graft-versus-leukemia effect. On the other hand, the percentage of IL-4-producing CD8+ T cells among CD8+ T cells was significantly higher in patients with cGVHD (mean 3.3%, range 1.3\u20138.2%) than in patients without cGVHD (mean 1.2%, range 0.8\u20131.7%) and healthy volunteers (mean 1.1%, range 0.1\u20131.6%) (both p<0.001). By contrast, the percentage of IL-4-producing CD4+ T cells was not different among patients with and without cGVHD and healthy volunteers. Then, we minutely explored the immunological role of IL-4-producing CD8+ T cells in healthy volunteers. These cells expressed the surface marker of CD25, CCR4 and CTLA-4. In the analysis of cytokine production in these cells, we identified the type 2 cytokine, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13, although we could not find IFN-g. In conclusion, these findings suggest that IL-4-producing CD8+ T cells may be an immunological marker of cGVHD in which these cells may play a crucial role as regulatory T cells.",
