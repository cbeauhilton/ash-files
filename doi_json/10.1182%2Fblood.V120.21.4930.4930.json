    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4930 Background: Autoimmune disorders have been observed in pts with myeloid neoplasms but their frequency and impact on the natural history of the myeloid neoplasms remains to be defined. Aim: To describe the frequency and prognostic impact of autoimmunity in pts with CMML. Methods: After IRB approval, a retrospective chart review of all pts diagnosed with CMML at Mayo Clinic between 1994 \u2013 2011. Autoimmunity (AI) was defined as positive serologic tests (Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti \u2013cyclic citrullinate peptide (CCP), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)), diagnosis of connective tissue disease (Rheumatoid arthritis, RA), vasculitis, or auto-immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Survival estimates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression model for multivariate analysis for via JMP software v. 9. Results: During the study period, 288 pts with CMML were evaluated at Mayo Clinic, 35% (n=100) were female. Median age at diagnosis was 71yr (20\u201395). Median hemoglobin was 11 g/dL(6\u201316), median white blood cell (WBC) 12 x10 9 /L (1\u2013302), and median platelet count 86 x10 9 /L (1\u20131110). Median peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) blasts were 0 and 5 respectively, while median PB and BM monocytes were 20% and 8% respectively. Eight-nine percent of pts had CMML1, while 10% had CMML2 and only 2 pts had CMML transforming into acute myeloid leukemia (-t). Karyotype analysis performed in demonstrated normal (diploid) karyotype in 180 (63%) pts and complex karyotype in 31 pts (11%). JAK2 mutation analysis was performed in 76 pts, 13% (10/76) of which were positive for JAK2V617F mutation. Autoimmunity was found in 46 (16%) of 288 pts. When tested, positive ANA, RF, CCP, and ANCA were found in 28/89 (31%), 8/61 (13%), 1/20 (5%), and 7/25 (28%), respectively. However, RA was reported positive in 6/288 (2%), and vasculitis was reported in only 4 pts. Median overall survival of the 288 patients was 496 days. Pts with evidence of autoimmunity had a median survival of 400 days compared to 527 days to the rest of the group (p 0. 73). On multivariate analysis, autoimmunity was not an independent risk factor for survival (p 0. 15), but age, platelets, WBC and body mass index (BMI) were independent factors. Conclusion: Autoimmunity is a frequent finding in pts with CMML. When tested, autoimmune antibodies were very frequent up to 31% of pts with CMML, but this did not confer into higher frequency of autoimmune diseases. Presence of positive autoimmune antibodies did not affect overall survival adversely.
