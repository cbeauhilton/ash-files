    "abstract_text": "Red blood cell (RBC) homeostasis tightly balances production of new erythroid cells and clearance of damaged or senescent RBCs. Macrophages play a central role in this process in the specialized niches termed erythroblastic island. Macrophages expressing CD169 (Sialoadhesin or Siglec-1), F4/80, CD11b, VCAM-1, ER-HR3 and Ly-6G play important roles in physiological and pathological erythropoiesis. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by chronic stress erythropoiesis as a compensatory mechanism for anemia. Recent publications have detected macrophage hypercellularity correlated with erythroid hyperplasia in genetic models of erythrocytosis and monocyte-derived macrophage proliferation in the spleen. Because macrophages are integral part of the erythropoietic niche, our objective was to assess the macrophage compartment in transgenic sickle cell mice (SS) at steady state compared to AA controls. Furthermore, we used acute blood loss in C57BL/6J wild type (WT) to confirm if macrophage hypercellularity accompanies erythroid hyperplasia in a mouse model without erythrocytosis or sickling. Using flow cytometry, macrophages were identified with F4/80, CD45, CD11b and CD169, while erythroid progenitor cells were identified with Ter119 and CD71 in the BM and spleen of SS mice and age-matched control (AA) mice. Each subset of macrophages is 3.8 to 6.8-fold higher in SS mice bone marrow compared to AA at steady state (p\u22640.05, Fig 1a). Findings were similar for other CD169 subsets in the spleens of SS mice. This macrophage hypercellularity was accompanied by expected erythroid hyperplasia, with 12-fold higher immature erythroid progenitor cells (CD71 hi Ter119 hi ) in SS mice than AA controls (p\u22640.001). To confirm the increase in macrophage numbers that accompanied erythroid hyperplasia in SS mice as a response to erythroid stress, we induce stress with acute blood loss in WT mice by phlebotomy (once). Interestingly, we found macrophage hypercellularity accompanies erythroid hyperplasia in WT mice during recovery from acute blood loss. WT mice showed about 47-61% increases in CD169 macrophages subsets in the marrow and 47-83% increase in the spleen during recovery from acute blood loss (5-7 days) compared to untreated mice (Fig. 1b). This macrophage hypercellularity was accompanied with 88% increase in immature erythroid progenitor cell. Similarly, we investigated if there was age dependence in macrophage hypercellularity that accompanies erythroid hyperplasia in SS mice. In SS mice, there was no significant differences in macrophage numbers in the BM juvenile mice (5 weeks old) compared to young adults (14 weeks old), presumably because the higher demand for erythroid production to compensate for anemia had already started in the juvenile animals. However, there was a significantly higher macrophage hypercellularity in the spleen at 14 weeks compared to juvenile animals (p\u22640.001). There was also a reduction in hematocrit (p\u22640.05) and hemoglobin (p\u22640.01) from 5 to 14 weeks in SS mice, although this does not correlate to either macrophage hypercellularity or erythroid hyperplasia. We also quantified mRNA expression of heme oxygenase 1 ( Hmox1 ), a critical regulator of erythroid stress response, in the BM of untreated SS mice, and untreated and stressed WT mice. As expected, BM cells from SS mice at steady state expressed significantly higher Hmox1 expression than in WT mice (p\u22640.001). Acute blood loss induced-stress raised the Hmox1 expression in WT mice to comparable levels to that of SS mice at steady state. Our investigation is the first to our knowledge to detect BM macrophage hypercellularity is associated with erythroid hyperplasia in response to acute blood loss and in congenital hemolytic anemia. Our data of macrophage hypercellularity in SCD opens up further research opportunity to elucidate the role of these cells in multiorgan complication in SCD.
