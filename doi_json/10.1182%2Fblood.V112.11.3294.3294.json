    "abstract_text": "Reduced-intensity conditioning for transplant (RICT) aims to exploit graft vs lymphoma (GvLy) effects while reducing conditioning-related toxicity. Because GvLy responses might be insufficient when HL are bulky and lymphoma growth is rapid, we pionered that intensive cytoreduction prior to RICT may allow GvLy reaction to be exploited ( Carella et al. JCO  2000 ; 18 : 3918 ). Thirty-eight patients with relapsed (n=26) or refractory (n=12) HL underwent RICT from an HLA-identical sibling preceeded by ASCT. Previous therapy consisted of 2\u20136 lines. High-dose therapy with ASCT consisted of BEAM protocol (n=29) or melphalan 200 mg/m 2 (n=9). RICT consisted of fludarabine-cyclophosphamide (n=30) or fludarabine-melphalan (n=8). The two groups had similar prognostic factors. The median time to neutrophils and platelets recovery was 10 days and 16 days, respectively. Chimerism studies indicated 100% donor-derived engraftment. Day 100 and cumulative (2 yrs) TRM were 5,3 % (2 pts) and 18% (7 pts), respectively. Seventeen patients (44%) are alive (12 in complete remission and 5 with stable disease) with a median follow-up of 41 months (7\u2013110 months). Twenty-one patients expired (TRM n=7, disease progression n=14). In conclusion, tandem ASCT/RICT is feasible and effective salvage therapy for patients with advanced HL. The long-term results obtained appear encouraging."
