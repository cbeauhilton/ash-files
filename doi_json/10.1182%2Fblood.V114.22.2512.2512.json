    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2512 Poster Board II-489 Introduction: KRAS is the most common gain-of-function mutation in human cancer and occur in some myeloid malignancies. Despite extensive data implicating aberrant responsiveness to cytokines in the pathogenesis of myeloid leukemias with hyperactive Ras, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We investigated the biochemical basis of hypersensitivity to granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-3, and stem cell factor (SCF) in primary cells from Mx1-Cre, KrasG12D mice. Methods: We utilized conventional biochemical techniques, phospho-specific flow cytometry, and small molecule inhibitors to interrogate signaling downstream of the activated GM-CSF and c-Kit receptors. Results: We found that endogenous KrasG12D expression deregulates multiple effectors in primary myeloid lineage cells. Although Ras-GTP levels are markedly elevated in bone marrow cells from KrasG12D mice, these cells only fully activate the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade upon cytokine stimulation. We used a \u201cchemical genetic\u201d strategy to explore the biochemical mechanism linking the activated GM-CSF receptor to oncogenic K-RasG12D and ERK. Surprisingly, inhibitors of type I PI3 kinases (PI-90, PI-103) as well as a p110 \u03b3/\u03b1 isoform inhibitor (AS605240) interfered with GM-CSF and SCF induced Ras/MAPK activation in wild-type and KrasG12D myeloid cells. These effects of PI3 kinase are mediated through activation of PLC-\u03b3 and the RasGRP guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Functional studies confirmed that inhibiting PI3 kinase or PLC-\u03b3 blocked KrasG12D-mediated myeloid progenitor colony growth. This PI3 kinase/PLC-\u03b3 module also functions downstream of the activated c-kit receptor in lineage- cKit+ Sca1+ (LSK) cells in SCF-induced ERK activation. Conclusions: PI3 kinase, PLC-\u03b3, and RasGRPs function upstream of normal and oncogenic K-Ras to efficiently activate the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade in primary hematopoietic cells. These data infer that PI3 kinase is both an important upstream regulator as well as a major downstream effector of Ras-GTP. Significance: Targeting PI3 kinase in hematologic cancers characterized by hyperactive Ras may have unanticipated biochemical and functional consequences in malignant and normal hematopoietic cells.
