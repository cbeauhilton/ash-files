    "abstract_text": "Background Patients with beta Thalassemia Major (TM) require life-long blood transfusions, which often cause iron overload that may increase patients\u2019 morbidity and mortality. Iron Chelation Treatment (ICT), aimed to reduce iron overload, is based on 8\u201312 hour infusions of Deferoxamine (DFO) for 5\u20137 days/week, and/or Deferiprone (L1) orally administered. Current ICT can be related to low satisfaction, low compliance, and potentially negative consequences on clinical effectiveness, patients\u2019 wellbeing and on healthcare costs. Aims: To investigate the Health-Related Quality-of-Life (HRQoL) of TM patients and their satisfaction with ICT. Methods: The Italian-THAlassemia-Cost-&-Outcomes-Assessment (ITHACA) was a naturalistic multicentre study conducted to evaluate costs, HRQoL, compliance and treatment satisfaction in TM patients undergoing ICT for at least 3 years, enrolled at Italian Thalassemia Care Centers. HRQoL was measured in >14 years old patients with 2 generic instruments: EQ-5D; Short Form-36 (SF-36). To measure satisfaction >12 years old patients received a 28-item instrument consisting of 4 domains: \u2018perceived effectiveness\u2019, \u2018acceptance\u2019, \u2018burden\u2019, and \u2018side effects\u2019. Each domain scored from from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied). Results Based on 126 patients: median age 29.4 years (12.3\u201348.5), 49.6% male. At enrolment 48.0% were using DFO, 33.6% L1, 18.4% were treated with DFO+L1. 86.5% of patients had at least one TM-related complication, 13.5% changed treatment regimen at least once in a median of 11.6 months before enrolment. With EQ-5D profile patients reported moderate problems with \u2018mobility\u2019 (9.1%), \u2018self care\u2019 (0.8%), \u2018usual activities\u2019 (23.5%), moderate or severe \u2018pain/discomfort\u2019 (60.5%) and \u2018anxiety/depression\u2019 (39.5%). Mean EQ-5D-Visual Analogue Scale was 73.0 (30\u2013100). The SF-36 Physical Component Summary mean(SD) score was 47.7(8.4), while the mean score estimated in the Italian general population comparable for age and sex is 53.3; the Mental Component Summary mean(SD) score in TM patients was 45.1(8.8), while the Italian general population mean score was 47.7. Mean satisfaction scores were 4.29 (perceived effectiveness), 3.37 (acceptance), 3.87 (burden), and 3.57 (side effects). Simple linear regression analysis showed that satisfaction with burden (r 2 =12.6%, p<0.0001), side effects (r 2 =12.3%, p<0.0001) and acceptance(r 2 =11.3%, p=0.0001), are positively associated with the adherence item \u2018never thinking about stopping medication\u2019 (p<0.0001 in both cases). Conclusions: TM patients on ICT have impaired levels of physical and mental HRQoL. Therapies improving patients\u2019 satisfaction and compliance to ICT may have positive consequences not only on clinical effectiveness but also on overall patients\u2019 well-being."
