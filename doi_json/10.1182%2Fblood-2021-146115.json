    "abstract_text": "Poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN)is an autosomal-recessive bone marrow failure (BMF) syndrome in which patients harbor homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the human gene C16orf57 , which encodes the evolutionarily conserved RNA 3' to 5' exonuclease U6 biogenesis 1 (USB1). USB1 is required for the proper maturation of U6 and U6atac snRNAs, core components of the spliceosome, and consequently, splicing defects have been observed in yeast and zebrafish models with USB1 deficiency. However, lymphoblastoid cells from PN patients do not exhibit reduced U6 snRNA levels and have normal pre-mRNA splicing, establishing PN as a singular BMF syndrome, where the underlying genetic cause has been identified but the molecular mechanisms leading to tissue failure remain obscure. To investigate the role of USB1 in a physiological context, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to create human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) containing a frequently occurring c.531_del_A loss-of-function mutation in the USB1 gene (USB1_c.531_del_A hESCs). USB1_c.531_del_A hESCs have normal karyotype, normal growth rate, and retain pluripotency, indicating that clinically-relevant mutations in USB1 are not deleterious in undifferentiated hESCs. To elucidate the role of USB1 during hematopoiesis, we performed serum-free hematopoietic differentiations to derive hematopoietic progenitor cells from WT and USB1_c.531_del_A hESCs. The formation of definitive hematopoietic progenitors (CD45+) was decreased in USB1 mutant cells compared to WT cells, and definitive colony potential analysis showed compromised colony formation in USB1 mutants. These observations indicate that loss-of-function mutations in USB1 negatively influence hematopoiesis. Additionally, as PN is associated with severe non-cyclic neutropenia, we analyzed the potential of neutrophil formation in WT and USB1 mutant cells. USB1 mutants have reduced formation of CD15+/CD66b+ lineages, indicating abnormal neutrophil development. Conditional expression of WT USB1 in USB1_c.531_del_A mutant cells rescued these phenotypes, leading to normal hematopoietic development. Interestingly, USB1 mutants showed no reduction in the overall levels of U6 and U6atac snRNAs, similar to what was observed in patient cells. To identify other possible targets of USB1, we sequenced the transcriptome and miRome of WT and USB1 mutant cells in different stages of hematopoietic development. Through these analyses, we demonstrate that hematopoietic failure in USB1 mutants is caused by dysregulated miRNA levels during blood development, due to a failure to remove destabilizing 3' end oligo(A) tails added by PAPD5/7. Moreover, we demonstrate that modulation of oligoadenylation through genetic or chemical inhibition of PAPD5/7 rescues the defective hematopoiesis observed in USB1 mutants. This work indicates USB1 acts as a miRNA deadenylase and suggests PAPD5/7 inhibition as a potential therapy for PN. Disclosures Parker:  Faze Therapeutics: Other: Co-founder.",
