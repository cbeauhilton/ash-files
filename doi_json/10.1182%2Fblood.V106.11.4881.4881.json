    "abstract_text": "Farnesyl protein transferase inhibitors (FTIs) represent a new class of anticancer agents. We were interested whether the farnesyltransferase inhibitors L-744,832 and LB42918 alone and in combination with imatinib are active in imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML cells. LB42918 was more potent with ED50 = 4 \u00b1 1 \u03bcM (mean \u00b1 S.D., n = 3) in the BCR-ABL+ imatinib-sensitive cell line EM-3 vs. ED50 = 25 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM for L-744,832 after 48 hrs of treatment and assessment by MTT assay. The growth of imatinib-sensitive K562 and LAMA84 cells was not measurably inhibited by L-744,832 doses up to 25 \u03bcM. Similarly, the growth of K562 was not affected by 25 \u03bcM of LB42918. However, for LB42918 in LAMA84 cells an ED50 value of 30 \u00b1 11 \u03bcM could be determined. In the imatinib-sensitive cell line EM-3, combination index values (CI) obtained using the method of Chou and Talalay indicated synergistic effects following simultaneous treatment with imatinib and FTI (CI = 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 and 0.7 \u00b1 0.2 at ED75 for imatinib + L-744,832 and imatinib + LB42918 respectively). In the cell imatinib-sensitive and -resistant lines K562 and LAMA84 a trend to lower ED50 values of imatinib was determined when up to 16 \u03bcM of L-744,832 or LB42918 were added, indicating potentiation of imatinib activity. Annexin V / propidium showed a strong increase of the apoptotic cell fraction in all imatinib-sensitive and an increase in the imatinib-resistant cells treated for 48 hrs by the combination imatinib + L-744,832 or imatinib + LB42918 as compared to treatment with each drug alone. Growth inhibition of CFU-GM colonies of primary imatinib-sensitive CML cells obtained from 4 patients is stronger after treatment with different concentrations of the combination of both drugs than after monotherapy with either imatinib or L-744,832. On the basis of the observed potentiation effects FTIs may find their place as supplement for CML patients on imatinib treatment.",
