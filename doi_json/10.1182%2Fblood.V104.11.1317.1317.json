    "abstract_text": "Background: In Hodgkin\u2019s Disease (HD), G-CSF has been used to maintain maximum dose intensity by avoiding neutropenia and treatment delays. Pre-clinical data and anecdotal reports have shown an association between G-CSF administration and bleomycin pulmonary toxicity (BPT). This complication may cause access morbidity and have a detrimental impact on survival in this otherwise good prognosis population. We embarked on a retrospective analysis to determine if G-CSF increased the incidence of this complication or had an impact on outcomes. Methods: We reviewed all patients managed for HD at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, from January 1986 to February 2003. BPT was defined by the presence of pulmonary symptoms, bilateral interstitial infiltrates, and no evidence for an infectious etiology. Patients who received G-CSF support with one or more of their bleomycin-containing chemotherapy cycles were considered as being treated with G-CSF. Results: A retrospective review identified 141 patients with HD treated with a bleomycin-containing regimen. The mean age of patients at diagnosis was 34 years. Fifty four percent were males. The histology was nodular sclerosing in 85%. The Hasenclever index was 0 in 15%, 1 in 35%, 2 in 24%, 3 in 16%, 4 in 9%, and \u2265 5 in 1%. The G-CSF and non G-CSF groups were balanced for poor prognosis risk factors including Hasenclever index. Frontline chemotherapy included ABVD in 57%, MOPP-ABV(D) in 33%, COPP-ABV in 8%, BEACOPP in 3%, and Stanford V in 2%. Forty one percent of patients received radiation. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) for all patients were 87% and 79% respectively. G-CSF was administered to 52% (74/141) of patients. BPT occurred in 18% of patients (25/141). A higher rate of BPT was observed in patients receiving G-CSF, 26% (19/74) versus 9% (6/67) in non G-CSF patients (p=0.0141). In this population, G-CSF administration was the only factor associated with an increased risk of BPT. There was no difference between the two groups for BPT associated risk factors including radiation, bleomycin dose, renal insufficiency, smoking history, and underlying lung disease. Additionally these risk factors showed no correlation with the development of BPT. The mortality from BPT was 4.2% (6/141) in all patients and 24% (6/25) in patients who developed the pulmonary syndrome. Of the 6 patients who died acutely, 83% (5/6) received G-CSF. CR rates were equal between the G-CSF and non G-CSF groups at 92% and 94% respectively. Five year OS and PFS were equal between the G-CSF and non G-CSF groups at 82% versus 89% (p=0.473) and 74% versus 84% (p=0.152) respectively. Conclusion: G-CSF administration increases the incidence of pulmonary toxicity in HD patients treated with bleomycin based chemotherapy. The major impact was on treatment related morbidity as 5-year OS and PFS were equal between the G-CSF and non G-CSF groups."
