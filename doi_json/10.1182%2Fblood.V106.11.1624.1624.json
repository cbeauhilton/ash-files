    "abstract_text": "There is a high background risk of venous thrombotic events (VTE) in patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM) and this is significantly increased following treatment with Thalidomide. The risk may be mediated by the production of a prothrombotic state, via an angiopathic mechanism, or alternatively it may arise from the release of prothrombotic factors from dying myeloma cells targeted by the treatment. No unifying evidence of a prothrombotic state has been demonstrated to date and it remains important to understand the mechanism underlying VTEs in order to prevent them effectively. Inherited genetic variants in the form of SNPs can affect the behaviour of clotting factors. These SNPs are functional and well characterised in the coagulation system and we have used them to analyse the mechanism underlying thalidomide induced VTE. As part of the Bank On A Cure TM project we have carried out an analysis of SNPs in 11 genes: GPIIA, ITGA, MTHFR, MTR, PPARG2, TFP1, VCAM, factor V, HABP2, prothrombin and THDB in a case series of 90 patients treated with thalidomide, with and without DVTs. This study showed a significant association with MTHFR and factor V polymorphisms. In order to validate and extend these initial observations we carried out an analysis of a second nested case control study using 131 Myeloma patients from within the MRC Myeloma IX trial, comprising 47 cases with a VTE and 94 age and sex matched controls exposed to the same treatment. We used a SNPlex panel containing 16 functional venous thrombosis associated SNPs, all of these functional polymorphisms have reported mechanisms and biology. We looked at polymorphisms in the genes: fibrinogen A (Ala331Thr), B (-455G>A, Lys478Arg) and G polypeptides (His140Tyr); Coagulation factors V(Arg534Gln), VIII (Glu1260Asp), IX(Ala194Thr), XI (Phe339Cys) and XII(-4G>T); PROCR(Gly219Ser); prothrombin(19911A>G ,20210G>A); MTHFR(Glu429Ala, Ala222Val); Serpine1(-844G>A) and TFPI(Met292Val). We have typed our selected SNPs using the SNPlex\u2122 Genotyping System, which is based on the oligonucleotide ligation/PCR assay with a universal fluorescently labeled ZipChute\u2122 probe detection. The probes are hybridized to complementary ZipCode\u2122 sequences that are part of genotype-specific amplicons. Probes are eluted and detected on a Applied Biosystems 3130 x DNA Analyser. This approach is an attractive alternative to existing genotyping methodologies, as it requires only three unlabeled probes per SNP, and consumes very little gDNA. The data analysis on the polymorphisms frequencies is ongoing to examine associations of thalidomide treatment with VTE events and will be presented. These datasets will allow a better definition of the pathogenesis of thalidomide related VTE, so that we can intervene therapeutically in a rational fashion.",
