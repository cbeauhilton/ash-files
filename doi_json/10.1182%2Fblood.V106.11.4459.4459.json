    "abstract_text": "Objective: While busulfan is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of many hematological diseases, its effectiveness against neuroblastoma is still in question. This study aims to assess the degree of apoptosis and cell death in neuroblastoma cell lines and primary neuroblastoma tumors when exposed to varying doses of busulfan. Materials and Methods: Cultures from established cell lines SKN-SH, SKN-DOX-R, IMR-5, and NGP (n=4), as well as cultures from primary tumors (n=2) were seeded at 10 6 cells/ml in RPMI640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and transferred to 24-well plates, where cells were exposed to 1ml of busulfan at 0, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1mg/ml per well. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 for 72 hours. Wells were sacrificed after 0, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours and tested with Annexin V and PI; 10,000 events were measured by flow cytometry. The percentage of apoptotic and dead cells was plotted in a graph and a t-test was performed against the untreated control. Results: After 24 hours, there was a significant decrease in cell viability of each dose when compared to the control untreated cells (p<0.005). 24 Hour % Cell Viability for Varying Doses of Busulfan (mg/ml)  .

However, there were only modest differences in effectiveness when comparing the doses, with an average of only 5\u20137% difference between doses. Further, there was much variability between the different cell lines, some with changes in apoptosis and cell death of over 50%, while other lines showed no changes at all. Limited differences were seen after 6 hours, and after 72 hours any effect of busulfan was masked by cell death due to other factors, as seen through increased cell death in untreated cells. Conclusion: Busulfan induced apoptosis and cell death in vitro in neuroblastoma cell lines at a mean of 76.43% for non-resistant lines, 59.33% for primary tumors and 35% for resistant cell lines (at middle dose 0.01mg/ml). The resistance of certain cell lines confirms the difficulties of treating multi-drug resistant cells in often heterogeneous neuroblastoma tumors. That some cell lines were responsive shows the potential of using busulfan to treat neuroblastoma in the future.",
