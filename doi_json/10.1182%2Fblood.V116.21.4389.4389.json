    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4389 Background: Hospitalized patients with infectious diseases are at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing both deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Our analysis evaluated real-world thromboprophylaxis use and DVT/PE rates in patients with infectious diseases in hospital, and for 30 days post-discharge. Methods: Data were extracted from the US Premier Perspective(tm)-i3 Pharma Informatics linked database for patients with infectious disease (International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision codes for infectious and parasitic diseases, skin infections, chronic infection, and postoperative infection) who had been admitted January 2005\u2013November 2007. Included patients had at least 6 months\u2019 continuous plan enrollment and were aged \u2265 18 years. Patients with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation were excluded, as were patients with a hospital stay of 0 days or > 30 days. Results: Of the 5,488 at-risk patients analyzed, 31% received inpatient pharmacological or mechanical DVT prophylaxis, and 3.2% received outpatient pharmacological DVT prophylaxis. Mean \u00b1 standard deviation duration of prophylaxis was 1.1 \u00b1 2.4 days for inpatients and 0.8 \u00b1 4.6 days post-discharge, with a total duration of 1.9 \u00b1 5.4 days. DVT/PE occurred in 3.61% of patients during hospitalization, and 0.98% of patients were rehospitalized or treated in the outpatient setting for DVT/PE. Conclusions: Our analysis highlights the considerable rate of DVT/PE and the underuse of DVT prophylaxis in hospitals. Furthermore, DVT/PE risk persisted post-discharge, yet few patients received outpatient prophylaxis. Improved prevention of DVT is required across the continuum of care to reduce preventable mortality and morbidity in patients with infectious diseases.
