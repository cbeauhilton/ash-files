    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4486 Background: Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is one of the main risk factors for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation and disease in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), however, whether there is a correlation between ATG dose and EBV reactivation is unsure. Aim of this single-center prospective study is to explore the relationship between ATG dose and EBV reactivation in allo-HSCT. Methods: Ninety-nine patients with hematologic malignancies underwent allo-HSCT and administration of ATG for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis were enrolled in this study in Nanfang hospital from February 2008 to February 2012. Sixty-one patients were unrelated donor transplants, thirty-eight were HLA-mismatched related donor transplants. GVHD prophylactic regimen was cyclosporine A+Methotrexate+ATG. According to donors' HLA matching, we chose three dosage groups of prophylactic ATG: low dose group with ATG dose of 5.0\u223c6.0mg/kg (n=28), medium dose group with ATG dose of 7.0\u223c8.0mg/kg (n=55), and high dose group with ATG doses of \u226510mg/kg (n=16). The levels EBV-DNA in plasma were regularly monitored by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). Results: With a median follow-up of 21 (range, 1\u201350) months post allo-HSCT, the cumulative incidence of EBV viremia and EBV-associated diseases was 17.6% (5/28) and 17.6% (5/28) in low dose group, respectively, with 32.7% (18/55) and 29.1% (16/55) in medium dose group, respectively, with 50.0% (8/16) and 31.3% (5/16) in high dose group, respectively. There were statistical significances of the incidence (\u03c7 2 \u25a1\u25a19.555, P=0.008). Logistic regression models showed that ATG prophylaxis was one of the main risk factors for EBV infection (RR=16.728, P=0.000) while bivariate correlation analysis presented that the incidence of EBV reactivation was positively correlated with ATG prophylaxis dosage (r pearman = 0.452, P = 0.000). The cumulative incidence of high degree (II\u223cIV\u00b0) aGVHD was 35.7% (10/28) in low dose group, with 39.6% (21/53) in total and 50.0% (6/12) in relapsed leukemia with HLA-mismatched related transplantation in medium dose group, with 68.8% (11/16) in high dose group. There were not statistical significances of the incidence (\u03c7 2 \u25a1\u25a16.971, P=0.137). Conclusion: EBV reactivation might be positively correlated with ATG prophylaxis dosage. According to donors' HLA matching, reducing ATG prophylaxis dose appropriately could prevent EBV reactivation in allo-HSCT without increasing high degree aGVHD.
