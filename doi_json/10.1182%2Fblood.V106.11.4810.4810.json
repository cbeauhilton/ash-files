    "abstract_text": "Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a fatal malignancy of T lymphocytes caused by infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), and remains incurable. Therefore, novel treatments are urgently needed. Galectins are a family of animal lectins with diverse biological activities. They function both extracellularly, by interacting with cell-surface and extracellular matrix glycoproteins and glycolipids, and intracellularly, by interacting with cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins to modulate signaling pathways. The distribution of galectins is quite diverse, and their expression in various leukocytes has been observed. To determine whether expression of galectins in T cells correlates with HTLV-I infection, we surveyed a number of uninfected and HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines for galectin-3, -8, and -9 expression by RT-PCR. Expression of galectin-8 did not correlate with HTLV-I infection. Galectin-3 was abundantly expressed in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells, but not in uninfected T-cell lines. In contrast, galectin-9 was abundantly expressed in uninfected T-cell lines and normal PBMCs, but not in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells. HTLV-I transformed protein, Tax, did not affect the expression of galectin-3 and -9. It was previously shown that galectin-8 and -9 are proapoptotic proteins. We found that galectin-9 prevented cell growth of HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells compared with galectin-8. Galectin-9 induced cell cycle arrest by reducing the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin B1, Cdk1, Cdk4, Cdk6, and Cdc25C, and apoptosis by reducing the expression of XIAP and c-IAP2. Most of these genes are known to be regulated by NF-\u03baB, which plays a critical role in oncogenesis by HTLV-I. Galectin-9 suppressed phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1. Most importantly, treatment with galectin-9 reduced tumor formation from an HTLV-I-infected T-cell line, HUT-102, when these cells were inoculated s.c. into severe combined immunodeficient mice. Our results suggest that galectin-9 may be a new approach for management of ATL."
