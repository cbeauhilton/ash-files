    "abstract_text": "Background: Relapse is expected when treating patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), with a shortened response associated with each relapse. Lenalidomide combined with rituximab (R 2 ) has shown enhanced activity, with a recently reported median progression free-survival (PFS) of 39.4 months in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including those with FL and MZL (AUGMENT; J Clin Oncol. 2019;37:1188). Methods: MAGNIFY is a multicenter, phase IIIb trial in patients with R/R FL grades 1-3b, transformed FL (tFL), MZL, or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; NCT01996865) in which optimal lenalidomide duration is being explored. Patients received 12 cycles of R 2 (lenalidomide 20 mg/d, d1-21/28 + rituximab 375 mg/m 2 weekly in cycle 1 and then on day 1 of cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) followed by 1:1 randomization in patients with stable disease, partial response, or complete response/complete response unconfirmed (CR/CRu) to R 2 versus rituximab maintenance for 18 months. Data presented here focus on induction R 2 in efficacy-evaluable MZL patients compared with the overall population of FL grades 1-3a+MZL (not including FL grade 3b, tFL, or MCL) receiving \u2265 1 treatment with baseline/post-baseline assessments. The primary end point is progression-free survival (PFS) by 1999 International Working Group criteria. Results: As of November 30, 2019, 393 patients with FL grades 1-3a and MZL enrolled; 76 (19%) had MZL. The median age of MZL patients was 68 years (range, 46-90), 68 (89%) had stage III/IV disease, and 72 (95%) had prior rituximab-containing therapy. Overall response rate was 68% with 39% CR/CRu, and median duration of response was 38.6 months (95% CI, 29.4-not reached [NR]). The median PFS was 41.2 months (95% CI, 38.4-NR). Efficacy results for MZL subtypes and the overall population (FL grades 1-3a + MZL) are shown in the table. Forty-two patients (55%) have completed 12 cycles of R 2 , and 41 (54%) have been randomized and entered maintenance. Twenty-eight patients (37%) prematurely discontinued both lenalidomide and rituximab, primarily due to adverse events (AEs; n = 11; 14%) and progressive disease (n = 6; 8%). The most common (\u2265 20%) all-grade AEs were neutropenia (49%), diarrhea (37%), anemia (25%), thrombocytopenia (24%), and constipation (24%). Most common (\u2265 10%) grade 3/4 AEs were neutropenia (41%; 1 patient [1%] had febrile neutropenia), thrombocytopenia (13%), and leukopenia (11%). Conclusions: R 2 is active with a tolerable safety profile in patients with R/R MZL. The efficacy and safety profile of R 2 in MZL patients were similar to results observed in the overall MAGNIFY population.
