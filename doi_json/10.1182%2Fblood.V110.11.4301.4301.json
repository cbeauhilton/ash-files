    "abstract_text": "Background: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by specific morphological and clinical features. However, its relative incidence among patients with AML is not yet established. Objectives: To define the relative incidence of APL in a large series of patients diagnosed with AML in a single institution and to identify the clinical-biological features characterizing the APL patients within the target population of AML. Methods: From 1976 to 2007, 1205 patients (median age 56 years, range 15\u201398) were consecutively diagnosed with AML in our institution. One hundred patients (8%) were considered AML secondary to solid neoplasia or chemotherapy, while 143 (12%) were secondary to myelodysplastic or myeloprolypherative syndromes (MDS/MPCS). The APL diagnosis was achieved through cytological studies supported by cytogenetics, and since 1995 by molecular techniques. Inmunophenotype analysis, using flow cytometry or inmunohistochemistry, was available in 808 (67%) patients. Positivity was defined as more than 20% blasts expressing a specific antigen. Results: Overall, 170 patients (14%) were diagnosed of APL. Of them, 43 (25%) were classified as M3 variant. The relative incidence of APL within AML secondary to solid neoplasia or chemotherapy and de novo AML was 13% y 16%, respectively (p=ns). In contrast, the relative incidence of APL within AML secondary to MDS/MPCS was 0.7% (p75% (94% vs 27%, p70% (92% vs 49%, p<0,0001), WBC <10x10 9 /L (70% vs 48%, p<0,0001), LDH <600 U/L (68% vs 58%, p=0,003), uric acid <7,5 mg/dL (96% vs 87%, p=0,002), fibrinogen <170 mg/dL (53% vs 3%, p<0,0001), hemorrhagic syndrome at diagnosis (84% vs 32%, p<0,0001), lack of hepatosplenomegaly (12% vs 24%, p=0,001). APL was significantly associated with the following surface or cytoplasmatic antigens: CD34 negative (\u2212), CD36(\u2212), HLA-DR(\u2212), CD14(\u2212), CD4(\u2212), CD56(\u2212), TdT(\u2212), CD11b(\u2212), CD7(\u2212), CD2 positive (+), CD9(+), CD33(+), CD71(+), CD117(+) and myeloperoxidase(+). Conclusion: In this large series of patients diagnosed with de novo or secondary AML, the relative incidence of APL was 14%, being exceptional the APL secondary to MDS/MPCS. To our knowledge, this is the larger hospital registry establishing the relative incidence of APL in a target AML population.",
