    "abstract_text": "Jak kinases are non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases that play a pivotal role in cytokine/growth factor signaling through phosphorylation of specific proteins such as the Stat molecules. Activated Stats translocate to the nucleus where they mediate transcription of several target genes involved in cell cycle progression and survival (Bcl-xL, cyclin D1, c-myc, survivin. Many tumors have highly activated Stats that are associated with aberrant Jak2 regulation and recent studies have shown that activating mutations in Jak2 (V617F) play a key role in many myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. Jak inhibitors may be useful in treating many diseases with aberrant Jak2/Stat signaling. The most commonly used inhibitor of Jak2 is the tyrphostin AG490, which inhibits Stat3 activation by preventing its tyrosine phosphorylation. However AG490 has limited in vivo efficacy and must be administered at high concentrations (>50 \u03bcM) for anti-tumor effects. We describe here a new class of compounds, termed degrasyns, that block Jak2 mediated activation of Stat3 in intact cells at high nM to low \u03bcM concentrations. Degrasyns (WP1130/CP2005) did not directly inhibit Jak2 tyrosine kinase activity but suppressed Stat3 activation by reducing the cytoplasmic levels of Jak2. Degrasyn-mediated Jak2 down-regulation was rapid (complete in 2 hrs) and not inhibited by proteasomal, lysosomal, or serine/threonine protease inhibitors. Biochemical studies and confocal microscopy show that degrasyn induces translocation of Jak2 from the plasma membrane/cytosolic fraction into the cytoskeletal fraction and this altered partitioning of Jak2 was associated with loss of cytokine-mediated Stat activation by degrasyn. Jak2 translocation was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of specific proteins which complex with Jak2. Lyn kinase in the cytoskeletal fraction was highly activated by degrasyn in multiple hematopoetic tumors (multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, leukemias). Jak2 translocation and Stat inhibition by degrasyn is mechanistically distinct from \u201cclassical\u201d Jak2 inhibitors and is not associated with a translocation of other kinases or cytokine signaling molecules in the Jak2 cascade (IL-6R, gp130, Lyn, Btk, Hck, Akt, PI-3K, Erk, Src, Jak1). Degrasyn induces cytoskeletal translocation of both wild-type and mutant (V617F) Jak2 and was associated with induction of apoptosis in HEL cells expressing the Jak2 V617F mutation. These results suggest that degrasyn suppresses Jak/Stat signaling through a unique mechanism involving translocation of Jak2 into a signal transduction incompetent compartment and may be used to investigate a novel form of Stat suppression. Degrasyn may also have anti-tumor effects on cells with aberrant activation of Jak/Stat signaling.",
