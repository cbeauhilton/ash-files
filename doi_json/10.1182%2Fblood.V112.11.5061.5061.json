    "abstract_text": "Objective: To investigate the effect of 6-phenylhexyl isothiocyanate (PHI) on drug resistance and sensitivity on K562/A02 cell line to ADM and elucidate the probable mechanisms. Methods: We measured growth inhibition of ADM on K562/A02 cell line by MTT assay. Apoptosis rate of K562/A02 cell line, the change of intracellular ADM and MRP1 protein level were detected by Flow Cytometry. Intracellular deoxidized GSH by spectrometric enzyme assay and MRP1 mRNA by RT-PCR semiquantitative assay were observed anteroposterior using PHI. Results: PHI can enhance the sensitivity of K562/A02 cell line to ADM, survival rate of K562/A02 cell line decreased with the increasing concentration of PHI and ADM. Apoptosis rate increased with treating by combination of two above drugs, and multiple of drug resistance had statistical significance (P0.05) no matter after or before PHI was used on different concentration. Conlusion: The depletion effect of PHI on the intracellular GSH can not only partly enhance the reverse effect of ADM, but also enhance the sensitivity of K562/A02 cell line to ADM. Such depletion may diminish side effect and treatment dosage of ADM. It provides a new view to the therapy of leukaemia."
