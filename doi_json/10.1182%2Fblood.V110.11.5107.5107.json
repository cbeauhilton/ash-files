    "abstract_text": "The prognosis for patients with severe refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is poor; High dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cell support is a salvage treatment under investigation for these patients. In our center, 17 patients with severe refractory SLE received autologous peripheral blood stem cells transplantation (PBSCT); Peripheral blood stem cells were mobilized with cyclophosphamide 4g/m 2 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 5 \u03bcg/kg/day. Enough PBSC were collected in all patients. There\u2019s no mobilization-related mortality, while 3 patients developed active lupus after mobilization which was controlled by slightly increasing the dosage of steroids. Following conditioning with cyclophosphamide 6g/m 2 plus anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, 20mg/kg/d, 5 days), cryopreserved PBSC (mean MNC 4.28\u00d710 8 /kg and CD34(+) cell 2.48\u00d710 6 /kg) were infused. Median ANC and platelet engraftment time were days +11 and +12 after transplantation, respectively. Treatment related complications include mucositis (14/17), infection (12/17), liver malfuction (10/17), edema or/and heart failure (3/17), renal failure (2/17), bleeding (5/17); One patient died from cerebral hemorrhage. Median follow-up is 22 months (9\u201328 months); All the patients improved with the SLEDAI score reduced from 25.2\u00b16.6 before to 9.7\u00b11.2 3 months after transplantation; Steroids were stopped or maintained at very low dose (equal to 5 to 7.5 mg/d predinisone). One patient had overt lupus relapse 8 months following transplant Conclusions Mobilization, harvesting and transplantation of peripheral blood stem cells in patients with severe refractory systemic lupus erythematosus is safe; The short-term result of the approach is effective in this group of patients; More patients needed to enroll a control study to validate the role of high-dose chemotherapy/PBSCT as the salvage treatment for severe SLE.",
