    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2029 Platelet regulation plays a critical role in hemostasis. Underactivation can result in failure to stop bleeding, whereas inappropriate platelet activation can cause thrombus formation. The 130-kDa scaffold protein spinophilin (SPL) has recently been shown to play a role in preventing platelet overactivation by forming a complex with the proteins RGS10, RGS18, and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. This complex dissociates when platelet are activated by thrombin or thromboxane A2 and evidence from spinophilin knockout mice suggests that this regulates platelet activation in vitro and in vivo . Spinophilin was originally isolated as a binding partner for the serine/threonine phosphatase, PP-1, in neurons. Here we asked whether PP-1 forms a complex with spinophilin in human platelets and, if so, whether the complex is affected by platelet activation. The approaches that we used to answer this question included Western blotting with antibodies to PP-1 and spinophilin, and co-precipitation studies looking for an association between spinophilin and PP-1. The results of the Western blots confirm the presence of PP-1 in platelets. The initial co-precipitation studies show that little, if any, PP-1 is associated with spinophilin in resting platelets, but there is a time-dependent increase in the SPL/PP-1 complex when platelets are activated with the PAR1 (thrombin receptor) activating peptide, SFLLRN. Thus it appears that within approximately the same time frame that the SPL/RGS/SHP-1 complex is decaying in activated platelets, the SPL/PP-1 complex is forming. Targets for PP1 have not been fully identified in platelets, but it is known that spinophilin localizes to the plasma membrane upon platelet activation. Since spinophilin is thought to direct PP1 targeting in neurons, it is reasonable to propose that it may be directing PP1 to targets in platelets in a similar manner. The studies described in this abstract were supported in part by a 2010 ASH Trainee Research Award to Andrew Sinnamon, who is a first year medical student at the University of Pennsylvania.
