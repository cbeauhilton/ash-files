    "abstract_text": "Introduction New oral anticoagulants are effective alternatives to warfarin; however, no specific reversal agents are currently available for life-threatening bleeding or emergency surgery. This study measured the effects of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated PCC (aPCC) and recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) and compared this to reversal with the specific antibody fragment for dabigatran after high-dose dabigatran etexilate (DE) treatment in a porcine model of trauma, to assess reversal of anticoagulation. Methods Studies were performed in 5 male pigs after ethical approval. DE was given orally for 3 days (30 mg/kg bid) and, on the 4th day, dabigatran was infused at 0.77mg/kg/h for 30 min followed by 0.52 mg/kg/min for 60 min. The infusion was administered immediately before trauma (blunt liver insult). Blood samples were taken before dabigatran infusion and 60 min post-injury. Two doses of PCC (30 and 60 IU/kg), aPCC (30 and 60 IU/kg) and rVIIa (90 and 180 \u03bcg/kg) and two doses anti-Dabi Fab (30 and 60 mg/kg) were added to blood samples ex vivo. Coagulation was assessed by thromboelastometry (ExTEM assay) and PT and dabigatran levels with diluted TT. Data were analyzed by ANOVA (\u00b1 SEM). Results Oral DE prolonged clot formation (CT: 389 \u00b1 128 sec; CFT: 159 \u00b1 39 sec) and PT (27 \u00b1 9 sec), but coagulopathy was more severe after achieving high dabigatran plasma levels (943 \u00b1 147 ng/ml) and inducing trauma (CT: 2378 \u00b1 480 sec; CFT: 3374 \u00b1 625 sec; PT: 167 \u00b1 40 sec). At this time point, 30 IU/kg PCC and 30 IU/kg aPCC significantly accelerated clot formation (PCC: CT 416 \u00b1 70 sec, CFT 250 \u00b1 91 sec; aPCC: CT 525 \u00b1 126 sec, CFT 309 \u00b1 60 sec; p<0.05 vs. untreated samples). These interventions also shortened PT (PCC: 53 \u00b1 14 sec; aPCC: 66 \u00b1 16 sec; p<0.05 vs. untreated samples). Higher doses of PCC and aPCC had no further effect on hemostatic parameters. rFVIIa had no impact on coagulopathy at any time point. Addition of the specific antidote to dabigatran completely normalized all coagulation parameters to baseline levels. Conclusion The ex vivo addition of either PCC or aPCC is effective in reducing coagulopathy in a porcine model of high-dose dabigatran therapy and trauma. However the specific aDabi-Fab is the most promising agent to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. The potential for reducing blood loss remains to be investigated.
