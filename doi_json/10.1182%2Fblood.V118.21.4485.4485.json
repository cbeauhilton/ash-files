    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4485 Purpose Thanks to the development of knowledge in the field of molecular biology, the great progress has been done in risk stratification of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at diagnosis, in recent years. Based on the recommendations of international expert groups there were identified the patients who may benefit from the allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) as a consolidation of first complete remission (CR). In the absence of an universal marker for minimal residual disease (MRD) measurements, there is still little information about the importance of MRD prior to allo-SCT. Our department has a very good experience with quantitative monitoring of WT1 gene expression as a marker of MRD during treatment of AML. The aim was to retrospectively evaluate the significance of MRD in patients indicated for allo-SCT in 1.CR. Patients and methods Overall 35 patients (pts) in the first morphological CR were transplanted from April 2005 - July 2011. Median age was 46 years (range; 20\u201363), mens 14, women 21, three good risk, intermediate risk 23, high risk 7 (NA 3). A total of 19 pts achieved CR after second induction (salvage), 11 pts were in 1st iCR. Induction 3+7 was given to 31 pts (4x other), as consolidation has been used HIDAC in 28 pts (7x other). As the graft, peripheral blood stem cells were used in 27 pts, bone marrow in 8 pts. The donor was identical sibling in 15 pts (1x mismatched sibling), matched unrelated donor (MUD) in 10 pts and mismatched UD in 9 pts. Conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 29 pts, reduced-intensity in 6 pts. Median follow-up was 18 months (range; 2\u201356). The expression of WT1 gene was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood according to the European Leukemia Net recommendations. The WT1 expression was related to the expression of a reference gene and the results were calculated with a number of WT1 copies related to 104 copies of ABL gene. The upper limit of normal WT1 expression was set as 50 copies of WT1 to 104 copies of ABL. Before allo-SCT, 25 pts were WT1-negative, ten pts were WT1-positive. Results When comparing the two groups according the MRD status, there was not significant difference in terms of age, risk groups, first induction failure, number of iCR, induction or consolidation type. Also, type of graft, conditioning regimen, or HSCT-CI was not significantly different. The group of WT1-positive pts had more unrelated donors, more aGVHD and shorter follow-up. In terms of cGVHD, the groups were comparable. When comparing the overall survival (OS) and cumulative relapse incidence (RI) of the entire group in terms of: risk group, first induction failure, iCR, consolidations number and incidence of aGVHD, we found no significant difference. Pts with cGVHD had a better OS, lower RI with comparable non-relapse mortality (NRM). In contrast, the MRD status measured by WT1 gene expression appears as clearly significant factor. The outcome of WT1-positive pts is significantly worse in terms of OS (55% vs 83% at 3 years, p = 0.03), RI (50% vs 11% at 3 years, p = 0.008), and there is a trend toward higher NRM (23% vs 5% in 3 years, p = 0.08). Conclusion Our results show that MRD status measured by WT1 gene expression in patients with AML in 1.CR significantly affects their future prognosis. Opportunities to influence the unfavorable prognosis of MRD-positive patients may be more intensive pre-transplantation therapy or earlier immunomodulatory intervention after allo-SCT (pre-emptive DLI). The larger prospective studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. The study was supported by scientific project MZ 00023736 granted by the Ministry of Health, Czech Republic.
