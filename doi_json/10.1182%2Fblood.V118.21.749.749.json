    "abstract_text": "Abstract 749 Introduction. Leukemia in infancy is extremely rare and etiologically distinct from leukemia arising in older children. Infant leukemia cases likely arise in utero , typically involve rearrangements of the mixed lineage leukemia ( MLL ) gene, and have a much poorer survival than older children with leukemia. Since genetic determinants of susceptibility to infant leukemia are likely different from those in older children, we aimed to evaluate genetic variants previously identified by genome wide association studies of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Methods. We genotyped candidate susceptibility loci in 171 Caucasian infants less than 12 months of age with acute leukemia (including 102 ALL, 67 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 2 biphenotypic cases) diagnosed during the period 1996\u20132006. Controls consisted of 384 healthy Caucasian blood donors. Associations between genetic polymorphisms in IKZF1 , ARID5B , and CEBPE and infant leukemia were evaluated using logistic regression and were further stratified by leukemia subtype and presence or absence of MLL gene rearrangements. Results. We observed a statistically significant association with two copies of the IKZF1 rs11978267 variant allele in infant leukemia overall (Odds Ratio (OR)=2.3, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=1.3-4.2), but not with the other susceptibility loci. The association with IKZF1 was concentrated in the AML group, with an increased risk associated with two copies of the variant allele (OR=3.9, 95%CI=1.8-8.4), but not one copy. The association was similarly strong in those with and without a MLL gene rearrangement. In contrast, a strong association with the IKZF1 variant was seen in infants with ALL lacking a MLL rearrangement (OR=5.1, 95%CI=1.8-14.5), but not in those with MLL rearrangements (OR=0.7, 95%CI=0.2-2.2). Moreover, infants with ALL and no MLL rearrangement had a strong association with a genetic variant in the gene, ARID5B (rs10821936, OR=7.2, 95%CI=2.5-20.6), which was also not seen in those with ALL and a MLL rearrangement. Discussion. IKZF1 (IKAROS) is expressed in early hematopoiesis, and its role in lymphopoiesis and lymphoid leukemia is well-described. IKAROS is also expressed in precursor myeloid cells, and our report is the first evidence that IKZF1 is important in the etiology of infant myeloid leukemia, irrespective of MLL gene rearrangements. Moreover, our data indicate striking differences in genetic susceptibility to infant ALL with and without rearrangements of the MLL gene. This knowledge could provide important new etiologic insights into this extremely rare but heterogeneous hematopoietic malignancy.
