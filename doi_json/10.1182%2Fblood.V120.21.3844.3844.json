    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3844 Novel sequencing technologies have allowed identification of a group of highly recurrent genetic mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Of importance, it has been noticed that a majority of these mutated genes in MDS encode important components of epigenetic regulation, including both DNA methylation and histone modifications. This phenomenon highlights the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of MDS. Recently, highly recurrent somatic mutations in the Histone H3.3-ATRX-DAXX chromatin remodeling pathway have been documented in pediatric glioblastoma (Schwartzentruber et al. Nature and Wu et al. Nature Genetics 2012), further supporting the importance of epigenetic regulation for tumorgenesis. We therefore examined potential genetic and epigenetic alterations of the same pathway in MDS. First, in a cohort containing 80 samples of MDS whole bone marrow mononuclear cell DNA (representative of both lower and higher risk disease), we performed Sanger sequencing covering genomic areas of reported mutations of H3F3A, H3F3B, ATRX, and DAXX in glioblastoma. Sequenced genomic areas included reported mutations in pediatric tumors: Lys27 and Gly34 of H3F3A and H3F3B; sequences upstream of and within the helices domain of ATRXX; and the whole coding sequence of DAXX. Overall, we only detected one mutation of H3F3A (K27N) in one MDS case (76 year old male with RA; INT-1; diploid). No other reported mutation of H3F3B, ATRX and DAXX genes was detected in any other patients of this MDS cohort. Because of the potential of epigenetic deregulation, we then examined status of DNA methylation for the promoters of ATRX and DAXX in MDS patients by bisulfite pyrosquencing. While no DNA hypermethylation of DAXX promoter was detected, 8 out of 40 (20%) patients had hypermethylation of the CpG island in the promoter region of ATRX. However, six of these eight patients were females. Based on reports of ATRX methylation in healthy females, it is likely that the 6 cases in female patients represent physiological \u00d7 chromosome inactivation. Finally, we performed RT-PCR analysis using cDNA samples isolated from CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells of 40 MDS patients. Results indicated that expression of ATRX and DAXX were increased by 2 fold (p-value 0.07) and 5.2 fold (p-value 0.0003) respectively compared to control CD34+ cells. The implications of this phenomenon need to be studied further. Taken together, these results suggest that genetic mutations of the H3.3-ATRX-DAXX chromatin remodeling do not play a role in the pathogenesis of MDS.
