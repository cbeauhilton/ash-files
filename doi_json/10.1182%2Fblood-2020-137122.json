    "abstract_text": "Frequency of IKZF1 Deletions in a Peruvian Population with B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Background: B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) is an aggressive disease with worse outcomes in older patients, and latino ethnicity. Additionally, Latino populations are at higher risk of developing B-ALL. IKZF1 is an essential lymphoid transcription factor with deletions ( \u0394 IKZF1) implicated in treatment failure and relapses. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of IKZF1 deletions in a cohort of Peruvian patients with newly diagnosed B-ALL. Methods: We collected diagnostic bone marrow samples from 41 consecutive patients with B-ALL diagnosed between 2015-2019 at Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas (INEN; Lima, Peru). Bone marrow samples were cryopreserved prior to induction treatment. DNA was extracted using High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche) at INEN. Samples with adequate DNA were screened for \u0394 IKZF1 by multiplex endpoint PCR covering four main deletions - dominant negative \u03944-7 or the loss of function \u03942-7, \u03944-8, and \u03942-8 IKZF1 deletions at UCL Cancer Insitute (London, UK) using the primers described by Caye et. al. We analyzed outcomes by IKZF1 status. Results: Forty-one cases were enrolled during the study period. Clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1. Median age was 20 years[1-63]. Fifteen \u2206IKZF1 cases (37%) were detected (67% BCR-ABL1 neg and 33% BCR-ABL1 pos) . Cases with \u0394 IKZF1 were older than those with wild-type IKZF1 (median age 31 vs 13 years, p=0.002). Median presenting white blood count (WBC) was 48 x10 9 /L [R:2-218], with a higher WBC in \u0394 IKZF1 compared to wild-type (87 vs 24 x10 9 /L, p=0.001). The most frequent deletion was \u22064-7 (seven BCR-ABL1 neg and three BCR-ABL1 pos ) additional deletions are described in table 2. All patients received intensive 'pediatric-based' treatment, 21 with BFM-2009 and 19 with the CALGB 10403 protocol. CR rates after induction were 67% and 92% for \u2206IKZF1 and wild-type cases, respectively. Eleven (73%) of patients with \u2206IKZF1 subjects (73%) were MRD positive by flow cytometry after induction compared to 11 (44%) among wild-type. At a median follow-up of 2 years EFS was 38% in the \u2206IKZF1 group and 58% in the wild type group, correspond OS was 38% and 58%, respectively. Conclusion: A high frequency of IKZF1 deletions was found in a Peruvian population with B-ALL and was associated with older age and higher presenting white blood counts. Prospective studies with larger Latino population are warranted to confirm this finding.
