    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1689 Poster Board I-715 Introduction The use of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has demonstrated activity in multiple myeloma and lymphomas. The HDAC inhibitor romidepsin is being evaluated in CTCL and PTCL, though its activity in B-cell lymphomas is less clear. We hypothesized that the combination of bortezomib and romidepsin would result in synergistic apoptosis in different B-cell NHL cell lines based upon the observed activity of this combination in more mature B-cell malignancies such as myeloma. Experimental Design Daudi, HT, Ramos and SUDHL-4 cell lines were exposed to different concentrations of bortezomib and romidepsin, separately, concurrently, and sequentially. Cell viability was assessed using MTT-assay, induced apoptosis was evaluated using Annexin V and PI staining from 24-48 hours. Apoptosis was also evaluated using western blot analysis of caspases and PARP cleavage. LC3 and HDAC6 level expressions were performed to determine if the effect of the combination was a result of the aggresome or autophagy pathway. Cell cycle studies were also performed to study if there were any changes after treating cells with the combination. Results The combination of bortezomib and romidepsin resulted in synergistic B-cell apoptosis as measured by MTT-assay with combination indices of < 0.5. This was associated with increased caspases and PARP cleavage as early as 24 hours after exposure. Order of addition experiments demonstrated definite sequence specificity. When romidepsin was added first, and 6 hours later followed by bortezomib, apoptosis was enhanced, compared to both agents being given concurrently or when bortezomib was administered first. Cell cycle analysis studies demonstrated that pretreatment of cells with romidepsin for 6 hours followed by the addition of bortezomib arrested the cells in G2M phase. HDAC6 expression was significantly reduced following combination therapy, and LC3-I was cleaved to LC3-II in treated cells suggesting that the combination affected aggresome formation and autophagy. Conclusion The combination of romidepsin and bortezomib at low nanomolar concentrations suggests that this may be an important clinical combination to test in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. Sequence of administration data is currently being tested to determine if the effect is a result of autophagy inhibition as is seen in myeloma cell lines. Additional mechanistic studies will be presented with the goals of identifying predictors of response that can then be validated in prospective clinical trials.
