    "abstract_text": "Co-senior authors Andrew Brunner and Andrew H. Wei contributed equally to this work Background : MBG453 is a high-affinity humanized anti-TIM-3 (T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3) IgG4 antibody in development for the treatment of MDS, AML, and other malignancies. TIM-3 is an immune checkpoint with a complex regulatory role in both adaptive and innate immune responses and is also preferentially expressed on leukemic stem and progenitor cells, making it a potential target in MDS and AML. MBG453 has been shown to enhance immune cell-mediated killing of AML cells in vitro . Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have been shown to increase immune checkpoint expression in MDS and AML, providing rationale to study the combination of HMAs with MBG453. Methods : Patients with Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) high or very high-risk (HR) MDS and newly diagnosed, or relapsed/refractory (R/R), AML following \u2265 1 prior therapy who were not candidates for standard chemotherapy and who were HMA naive were enrolled in this multi-center, open label phase Ib dose-escalation study (NCT03066648). Escalating doses of MBG453 were administered i.v. every 2 weeks (Q2W; days 8, 22) or every four weeks (Q4W; day 8) in combination with decitabine (20 mg/m 2 ; i.v. days 1-5). The primary objectives were to characterize the safety and tolerability of MBG453 in combination with decitabine and to identify recommended doses for future studies. Secondary objectives included assessing preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics of the combination. Dose escalation followed a Bayesian logistic regression model based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Adverse events (AEs) were graded using NCI-CTCAE v4.03. The International Working Group criteria for MDS (Cheson et al, 2006) or AML (Cheson et al, 2003) were used to assess efficacy. Results : As of March 25, 2019, 17 HR-MDS, 4 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and 38 AML patients have received decitabine and MBG453 at 240 mg Q2W (n=22), 400 mg Q2W (n=21), or 800 mg Q4W (n=16). MTD has not been reached. Median age was 70 years (range 23-87 years). 24 patients are ongoing (duration of exposure 1.1 to 18.6 months) with 35 patients discontinued (disease progression [n=19, 32%], AE [n=1, 2%], patient/physician decision [n=13, 22%], death [n=2, 3%]). There was one DLT consisting of a grade 3 ALT elevation that was corticosteroid responsive. The most common treatment emergent grade 3/4 AEs were febrile neutropenia (39%), neutropenia (34%), thrombocytopenia (31%), and anemia (29%). A total of 8 patients (14%) developed \u2265 grade 2 suspected immune related AEs (irAEs) considered to be MBG453 related; 4 of whom (7%) presented with grade 3/4 events: ALT elevation (n=2), arthritis (n=1), and GGT increase (n=1). No study treatment-related deaths were observed. 16 HR-MDS and 31 AML patients have had post-baseline disease response assessments. Median duration of decitabine and MBG453 is 3.9 months (range 0.7-18.6 months). Evidence of activity with MBG453 in combination with decitabine has been seen at doses ranging from 240 mg Q2W to 800 mg Q4W. 8 of 16 (50%) HR-MDS patients achieved mCR or CR. None of the responding HR-MDS patients has had disease recurrence with exposure durations currently ranging from 3.4 to 18.6 months; two patients in mCR underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant. 4 of 14 (29%) newly diagnosed AML patients have achieved a response of PR or better (2 PR, 2 CR), with 3 additional patients exhibiting \u2265 50% bone marrow blast reduction, and 10 of 14 (71%) continuing on study. 5 of 17 (29%) R/R AML patients have achieved a response of CRi, with 5 additional patients exhibiting \u2265 50% bone marrow blast reduction. Exposure durations for all AML responders currently range from 2.1 to 17.9 months. Median onset of response among all patients was 2.0 months. TIM-3 expression was detected on leukemic cells, with modulation of TIM-3 expression following treatment with decitabine. Conclusions : In this ongoing study in patients with HR-MDS and AML, the combination of MBG453 and decitabine was safe and well tolerated, and exhibited evidence of anti-leukemic activity with encouraging preliminary response rates occurring at a median of 2 cycles, with durability in both HR-MDS and AML. These findings validate TIM-3 as a promising therapeutic target in MDS and AML and support further clinical development of MBG453 in combination with HMAs in patients with MDS and AML.
