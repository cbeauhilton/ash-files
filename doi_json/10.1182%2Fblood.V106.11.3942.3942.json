    "abstract_text": "Human platelets express two P2Y receptors: Gq-coupled P2Y1 and Gi-coupled P2Y12. Both P2Y1 and P2Y12 are ADP receptors on human platelets and are essential for ADP-induced platelet aggregation that plays pivotal roles in thrombosis and hemostasis. Numerous constitutively active G protein-coupled receptors have been described in natural or recombinant systems but in the P2Y receptors, to date, no constitutive activity has been reported. In our effort to identify G protein coupling domains of human platelet ADP receptor we constructed a chimeric HA-tagged human P2Y12 receptor with its C-terminus replaced by the corresponding part of human P2Y1 receptor and stably expressed it in CHO-K1 cells. Interestingly, the chimeric P2Y12 mutant exhibited a high level of constitutive activity as evidenced by decreased cAMP levels in the absence of agonists. The constitutive activation of the chimeric P2Y12 mutant was abolished by pertussis toxin, a Gi inhibitor. The constitutively active P2Y12 mutant retained normal responses to 2-MeSADP, with an EC50 of 0.15 \u00b1 0.04 nM. The constitutively active P2Y12 mutant caused Akt phosphorylation that was abolished by the addition of pertussis toxin. Pharmacological evaluation of several P2Y12 antagonists revealed AR-C78511 as a potent P2Y12 inverse agonist whereas AR-C69931MX as a neutral antagonist. In conclusion, this is the first report of a cell line stably expressing a constitutively active mutant of human platelet P2Y12 receptor and the identification of potent inverse agonist.",
