    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic HSCT is a potentially curative treatment for AML/MDS, but aging is generally associated with poorer outcomes. The incidence of AML/MDS, however, increases after the 7th decade of life, and there is limited data with transplantation in this age group. Here we review our experience treating such patients. Methods : Retrospective analysis of outcomes of patients aged 65 or older treated from 1996 to 2004 with allogeneic HSCT (n=40; median age 67 years, range 65\u201375 years). Diagnosis was MDS in 5 cases and AML in 35 patients. Cytogenetics were high-risk in 50% and intermediate risk in 50%; 80% of the patients had active disease at HSCT (n=32). All preparative regimens contained fludarabine 100\u2013150 mg/m 2 , combined with cytarabine 4 gm/m 2 , and idarubicin 36 mg/m 2 (n=12); or with busulfan (n=8); with melphalan 140 or 180 mg/m 2 (n=12); and with melphalan 140 mg/m 2 and Mylotarg 2 or 4 mg/m 2 (n=8). ATG was added in unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT. All but 2 patients received tacrolimus and methotrexate for graft-versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Stem cell source was bone marrow in 11 cases and peripheral blood in the others. Donors were related in 27 cases and unrelated in 13 cases (33%). Results : 35 patients engrafted (88%); complete remission (CR) rate was 72%, 6 patients died early and 3 did not respond. Eleven patients are alive at a median of 12.5 mo (range, 2.6\u201359 mo), 10 of them in CR. One-year overall survival was 30% for the whole group, 26% for recipients of MUD and 32% for recipients of related donor HSCT (MUD x sibling, P=NS). One-year event-free survival was 28%. Median survival and disease-free survival was 4.5 and 2.5 mo, respectively; 42% of the patients in CR post HSCT have relapsed (n=13). Acute and chronic GVHD rates were 45% and 48%, respectively. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 40%. View large Download slide Figure shows survival of patients with and without circulating blasts at the time of transplant.

Close modal Conclusions : Here we expanded our previous observations indicating that allogeneic HSCT is a treatment option for selected patients in this age range. In this cohort with advanced stage disease (80% with active disease at transplant), NRM was high, but survival after sibling and unrelated donor transplants was similar.",
