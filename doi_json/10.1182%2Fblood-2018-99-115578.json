    "abstract_text": "Background: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and is characterized as a heterogenous disease associated with varying outcomes. The International Prognostic Index (IPI) has been the standard for baseline prognostic assessment in these patients. In this study we aimed to determine the impact of treatment facility (academic versus non-academic centers) on overall survival outcomes in DLBCL patients stratified by IPI score risk groups, with a focus on high risk disease as this is associated with poorer outcomes. Methods: The 2018 National Cancer Database (NCDB) was utilized for patients diagnosed with DLBCL between 2004-2015. Patients were then stratified based on IPI risk score from low to high risk. Four risk groups were formed: low (0-1), low-intermediate (2), high-intermediate (3), and high (4-5). Overall survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meyer analysis with bivariate cox proportional hazard ratios to compare survival by facility type (academic or community centers) within these risk groups. Results: A total of 160,137 patients were identified. Of these cases 31.8% were classified as low risk, 21.9% were low-intermediate risk, 22.2% were high-intermediate risk, and 24% were high risk. 59.3% of patients were treated at a community center and 40.7% were treated at academic centers. Treatment at academic centers was associated with a significantly improved overall survival (OS) for each risk category. Median survival (in months) for high risk IPI score DLBCL was 47.9 months in community and 61.1 months in academic centers (p<.0001). Median survival for high-intermediate risk score was 48.3 months in community and 87.3 months in academic centers (p<.0001). Median survival for low-intermediate score was 90.3 months in community and 122.8 months in academic centers (p<.0001). Median survival for low risk score was 132 months in community and 148 months in academic centers (p<.0001). Hazard ratios for academic center versus community center for high risk, high-intermediate, low-intermediate and low risk are 0.768, 0.71, 0.848 and 0.818 respectively (p<.0001). Conclusions: Facility type is significantly associated with improved survival outcomes across all IPI based risk groups for DLBCL. This benefit is especially significant in higher risk disease where positive outcomes are less common, suggesting treatment at academic centers may be particularly beneficial in these patients. Some of the possible reasons for this difference may include provider experience, increased access to resources, and opportunity for clinical trials. Further investigations into the factors contributing to such disparities should be done to help standardize care and improve outcomes.
