    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4801 MDSC have been described as an important negative regulators of autologous anti-cancer immune responses. Considering the important role of MDSC in immune regulation in allogenic stem cell and organ transplantation, we undertook an investigation of the mechanism(s) by which MDSC inhibit T\u2013cell activation and proliferation, and tested the hypothesis that local cytokine secretion or IDO activity is required for suppression of T-cell proliferation. Two separate populations CD11b hi Gr-1 hi and CD11b hi Gr-1 int were isolated by high-speed FACS from lineage- BM antigen presenting cells (C57 & BALB/c mice). Both MDSC subsets had potent capacity for in\u2013vitro suppression of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells proliferation in response to anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads and Con A. A ratio of 0.5/1 MDSC: T-cells were sufficient to inhibit >66% control levels of T-cell proliferation. MDSC isolated from transgenic mice that had been \u201cknocked-out\u201d for IFN-\u03b3 and IDO had equivalent suppressive activity as MDSC from wild-type donors. Addition of saturating concentrations of anti IL-10 and IL-4 MAb, or in combination with anti- IFN-\u03b3 MAb did not abrogate MDSC-suppressive activity. Ex-vivo culture of MDSC with mitogen-activated T-cells generated two\u2014fold more Fox-p3 T-reg compared with cultures of T cell plus mitogen. Data will be presented regarding the novel role of MDSC involving in the homeostasis regulation of normal T-cell activation and proliferation in non-tumor-bearing mice.
