Integrins reside on cell surfaces in an equilibrium between inactive and active conformations that are regulated by transmembrane (TM) domain interactions: when integrins are inactive, the TM domains of their \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits interact; the domains separate when integrins assume their active conformation. Platelets express five \u03b1 subunits (\u03b12, \u03b1IIb, \u03b1v, \u03b15, and \u03b16) and two \u03b2 subunits (\u03b21 and \u03b23) that combine to form five adhesions receptors. Previously, we observed that the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 TM domains undergo both heteromeric and homomeric interactions and there is overlap of the interfaces that mediates these interactions. Less is known about the other platelet integrins. To study their interactions, we used the TOXCAT assay. In TOXCAT, a chimeric protein consisting of an N-terminal ToxR\u2019 DNA binding domain, a C-terminal maltose-binding protein domain, and an interposed TM domain is expressed in the E. coli inner membrane. TM domain-mediated dimerization of the chimeric protein drives the transcriptional activation of a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene. To enable TOXCAT to measure heteromeric as well as homomeric interactions, we introduced an R68K mutation into the ToxR\u2019 DNA-binding region, thereby preventing CAT synthesis without affecting protein expression. Thus, when both wild-type and disabled ToxR\u2019 are concurrently expressed from the same plasmid, disabled ToxR\u2019 exerts a dominant-negative effect on CAT synthesis. Using this assay, we found that the interaction of platelet integrin TM domains correlated with the presence of a small residue (sr)-xxx-small residue motif (sr-x3-sr) where x = any residue: \u03b12, \u03b1IIb and \u03b21, each of which contains a Gx3G motif, had the strongest tendency to undergo specific homomeric association, whereas \u03b12+\u03b21 and \u03b1IIb+\u03b23 had the strongest tendency to form heterodimers. In the TM domains of \u03b1v, \u03b15 and \u03b23, one or more of the glycines in sr-x3-sr is replaced by Ser or Ala; as a result, homomeric interactions involving these subunits are substantially weaker. Moreover, mutating each of the small residues in sr-x3-sr to Leu precluded the formation of TM domain oligomers, emphasizing the importance of the sr-x3-sr motif. The dominant-negative TOXCAT assay was also used to screen for inactivating \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23 mutations. By introducing random mutations into the \u03b23 TM domain and selecting mutants based on a reduction in CAT synthesis, we identified mutations that enhanced heteromeric \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23 association. It is noteworthy that mutations that enhanced the interaction of \u03b23 with \u03b1Iib were present along the face of the \u03b23 TM helix containing the sr-x3-sr motif. By contrast, mutations enhancing \u03b1v\u03b23 association were distributed throughout the \u03b23 TM helix and didn\u2019t cluster around the sr-x3-sr motif. In summary, we have demonstrated that the TM domains of platelet integrin subunits, in addition to \u03b1IIb and \u03b23, undergo specific heteromeric and homomeric interactions, suggesting that TM domain interactions may regulate the function of the integrins containing these subunits. Further, our results indicate that sr-x3-sr motifs play an essential role in the oligomerization of these subunits, suggesting that these motifs play a central role in regulating integrin function.",
