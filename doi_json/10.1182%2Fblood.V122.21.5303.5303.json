    "abstract_text": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells express high levels of CD44, a cell-surface glycoprotein receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA). We found that a mAb specific for CD44 was directly cytotoxic for leukemia B cells, but had little effect on normal B cells. Moreover, this anti-CD44 mAb could induce CLL cells that expressed the zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP-70) to undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis, independent of complement or cytotoxic effector cells ( Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA 2013, PMID: 23530247 ). The cytotoxic effect of this mAb was not mitigated when the CLL cells were co-cultured with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) or hyaluronic acid or when they were stimulated via ligation of the B-cell receptor with anti-\u00b5. A6 (Angstrom Pharmaceuticals) is an 8-amino acid peptide that has marked homology with a linear sequence of CD44. A6 can bind CD44 within a region of the ligand-binding domain, leading to inhibition of the migration and metastatic potential of CD44-expressing cancer cells in vitro and in vivo ( Mol Cancer Ther, 2011 PMID: 21885863 ). We evaluated the cytotoxic activity of A6 against primary leukemia cells of patients with CLL (n = 22). We found that A6 peptide also was directly cytotoxic for CLL cells isolated from different patients in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations that may be achieved in vivo. The A6 peptide appeared less cytotoxic for CLL cells than the intact anti-CD44 mAb, but still had greater direct cytotoxicity for CLL cells that expressed ZAP-70 than for CLL cells that were ZAP-70 negative. Furthermore, the A6 peptide had negligible effect on the viability of lymphocytes isolated from the blood of healthy donors (n = 3). Because clinical studies have found the A6 peptide to be well-tolerated and without dose-limiting toxicity in patients with solid tumors who have been treated to date (N = 40), a clinical study is planned to evaluate the safety and activity of the A6 peptide in the treatment of patients with CLL.
