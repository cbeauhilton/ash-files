    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have a high rate of relapse resulting in a need for multiple lines of therapy. In contrast to MM with standard risk cytogenetics (SR-Cyto), high-risk cytogenetics (HR-Cyto) in MM such as del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), and gain(1q) (\u22653 copies), can result in shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with less durable responses. Treatment regimens that can overcome the negative effect of HR-Cyto abnormalities are required to address this area of unmet medical need. Exportin 1 (XPO1), is overexpressed in many hematologic and solid tumor malignancies including MM, and exports tumor suppressor proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, leading to their inactivation. Elevated levels of XPO1 are correlated with more aggressive MM and resistance to therapy and confers a poor prognosis. The potent oral XPO1 inhibitor, selinexor, has been approved as a triplet combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for previously-treated MM. In the Phase 3 BOSTON study, treatment with XVd in patients with previously treated MM significantly prolonged median PFS and improved the overall response rate (ORR), with a trend towards a prolonged OS amongst all patients as well as those with HR cytogenetics. Methods: We performed post hoc analyses on patients with previously-treated MM from the XVd arm of the Phase 1b/2 study STOMP (NCT02343042) and the Phase 3 BOSTON (NCT03110562) study to determine the effects of cytogenetic abnormalities on outcomes. The HR-Cyto group included patients with at least one of the following cytogenetic abnormalities at initial diagnosis or screening: del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), or gain(1q) (\u22653 copies). Efficacy was based on independent review committee. Results: A total of 106 patients with HR-Cyto were identified, including del(17p) (n=25), t(4;14) (n=25), t(14;16) (n=10), and gain(1q) (n=80). There were 131 patients classified as SR-Cyto including those with unknown cytogenetics. Baseline demographics were similar between groups with median age of 66 years old (range 40-87). Patients with HR-Cyto had a median PFS of 12.9 months and patients with SR-Cyto had a median PFS of 16.6 months; PFS on the BOSTON Vd control arm were 8.6 and 9.5 months with HR- and SR-Cyto, respectively. Of the individual abnormalities, a PFS of 13.2 and 13.9 months was observed in the t(4;14) and gain1q subgroups, respectively. Of the HR-Cyto subgroups with more than 10 patients, a similar median OS was observed in comparison to SR-Cyto and ranged from 20.4 months to not reached. The response of XVd treatment was maintained across HR-Cyto risk subgroups, with an ORR of 76.4% overall and the following values for subgroups: del(17p) (72.0%), t(4;14) (88.0%), and gain1q (73.8%). The ORR of the SR group was 69.5%. Of all patients that received XVd, there were 6 CRs (5.7%) and 32 VGPRs (30.2%) in the HR group and 9 CRs (6.9%) and 29 VGPRs (22.1%) in the SR group. The ORRs on the BOSTON Vd control arm were 57.7% and 64.7% for HR- and SR-Cyto, respectively. The rates of the most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of any grade were similar across risk groups (HR- vs SR-Cyto): thrombocytopenia (65.1% vs. 54.2%), nausea (53.8% vs. 53.4%), fatigue (47.2% vs. 45.0%) decreased appetite (37.7% vs. 42.0%) and anemia (34.6% vs 40.5%). Rates of AEs of any grade peripheral neuropathy (PN) were 35.8% overall, 40.0% in del(17p), t(4;14) (40.0%), t(14;16) (30.0%), gain(1q) (38.8%), and 23.7% in the SR group. The rates of PN in the HR and SR groups of the XVd arm of the BOSTON and STOMP studies were 37.1% and 29.6% and 11.1% and 15.2%, respectively. The corresponding rates for Vd alone in the BOSTON study were 48.6% and 47.0%. Conclusions: Patients with MM with HR-Cyto treated with XVd demonstrated a comparable ORR and PFS, with a manageable safety profile compared to patients with SR-Cyto, supporting the use of XVd in patients with any cytogenetic profile. These results are consistent with the distinct and broad mechanism of action associated with XPO1 inhibition and the use of the agent in earlier lines of therapy. Further assessment of selinexor in combination with other therapies in patients with MM across the entire cytogenetic spectrum is warranted.
