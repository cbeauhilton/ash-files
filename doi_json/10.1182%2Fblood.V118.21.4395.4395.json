    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4395 G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) is the most commonly used graft source for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Recent improvements in optimizing PBSC collections include the introduction of plerixafor, real-time monitoring of blood CD34+ cells prior to initiation of apheresis, and increasing use of large volume apheresis. The Spectra Optia (SPO; CaridianBCT) is a new cell separation device. This study was designed to evaluate the CD34+ cells collection efficiency of the SPO device in comparison to a consecutive series of patients recently collected using the COBE Spectra (CSP) device. We performed an IRB-approved analysis of apheresis procedures performed at two large transplant centers of the collection outcomes of 15 apheresis procedures performed on the SPO platform with 32 apheresis procedures performed on the CSP platform. SPO and CSP cases were matched in a ratio of approximately 1:2 by the percentage of CD34+ cells in the blood at the time of starting apheresis. Primary outcomes measurements were the total numbers of CD34+ cells/kg collected and the efficiency of collection of CD34+ cells by apheresis [efficiency = total CD34+ cells collected(net of sampling)/(CD34+ cells/uL blood\u00d7blood volume processed)]. A comparison of apheresis on each device is summarized in the Table . The average flow rate and whole blood volume processed were significantly less on the SPO versus on the CSP. There were no statistical differences between comparing the SPO and CSP platforms with respect to the efficiency of CD34+ cell collection (mean values of 0.53 \u00b1 0.11 and 0.48 \u00b1 0.17, respectively), or the total numbers of CD34+ cells collected/kg in a single apheresis 10.6 \u00b1 8.9 \u00d7 10E6/kg and 9.2 \u00b1 5.9 \u00d7 10E6/kg, respectively. Apheresis performed on the SPO device did result in less depletion of platelets in the blood, when platelet were measured immediately before and the day following apheresis with decrements in blood platelet counts of 36% \u00b1 10% and 50% \u00b1 15%, respectively, in a subset of 14 SPO and 23 CSP patients analyzed for this end-point (P=0.009). Apheresis using the SPO platform resulted an equivalent efficiency of CD34+ cell collection as the CSP platform, with somewhat less depletion of platelets. The smaller \u201cfoot-print\u201d of the SPO device and quieter operation make it attractive as an alternative to the CSP apheresis platform. A registration clinical trial is in progress to obtain 510k approval. Table: Comparison of CD34+ Cell and Platelet Collection Efficiency on the COBE Spectra and OPTIA.
