    "abstract_text": "Abstract 633 Background: To date, the only well characterized chromosomal translocations among peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are those involving ALK , which occur in about half of anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs). ALK-negative ALCLs remain poorly understood, despite morphology and phenotype similar to ALK-positive ALCLs. We recently described translocations near IRF4 on 6p25.3 in cutaneous ALK-negative ALCLs. In the present study, we utilized massively parallel (Next Generation) sequencing to answer three questions about these translocations: (1) Were they recurrent in the more lethal systemic form of ALK-negative ALCL? (2) What was the translocation partner? (3) What were the likely genetic consequences? Methods: We used a mate pair library approach to juxtapose DNA sequences originally lying ~5 kb apart: these paired sequences map to distinct areas of the genome if a translocation breakpoint lies between them. Because only the ends of the original DNA fragments are sequenced, this approach is more resource efficient than whole genome sequencing. Genomic DNA from a systemic ALK-negative ALCL with an uncharacterized 6p25.3 rearrangement was fragmented to 2\u20135 kb, biotinylated, and separated on an agarose gel. Fragments ~5-5.5 kb were excised, purified, circularized, and further fragmented to ~300-600 bp. Fragments containing biotin (representing the ends of the original 5 kb fragments) were immobilized on streptavidin beads and amplified using the Illumina library protocol. Paired end sequencing was performed on one lane of a flow cell on an Illumina GAIIx. Sequencing data were mapped to the genome using a binary indexing algorithm. Non-mapping and duplicate sequences were discarded. Candidate translocations suggested by >4 unique mate pairs were examined by BLAT to exclude false positives explained by mapping to homologous regions. PCR and Sanger sequencing of tumor DNA was used for validation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on additional PTCLs. mRNA and miRNA expression was quantified using real-time PCR. Results: Of 28.90\u00d710 6 paired sequences, 8.61\u00d710 6 were non-duplicate pairs in which both ends mapped to the human genome (bridged coverage, ~7x). Only one candidate translocation involved 6p25.3, represented by 10 unique mate pairs. PCR and Sanger sequencing confirmed a balanced translocation: one breakpoint disrupted the dual-specificity phosphatase gene, DUSP22 , telomeric to IRF4 on 6p25.3; the other was telomeric to the FRAH7 fragile site on 7q32.3. Additional ALK-negative ALCLs with known 6p25.3 rearrangements were tested using a 7q32.3 breakapart FISH probe, which showed a 7q32.3 rearrangement in 13/29 (45%; 7 systemic and 6 cutaneous). Dual fusion FISH confirmed t(6;7)(p25.3;q32.3) in 11/11 cases tested. None of 120 PCTLs (including 39 ALCLs) lacking 6p25.3 rearrangements had a 7q32.3 rearrangement. Levels of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 DUSP22 mRNA in cases with 6p25.3 rearrangements were decreased relative to those in non-rearranged cases (5\u2032: 0.02\u00b10.01 vs 1.00\u00b10.74, p=.002; 3\u2032: 0.09\u00b10.08 vs 1.00\u00b10.55, p=.0002; mean\u00b1SD, t test). IRF4 mRNA levels were similar in both groups. Levels of MIR29A and MIR29B1 within FRAH7 in cases with 7q32.3 rearrangements were increased relative to those in non-rearranged cases ( MIR29A: 2.44\u00b12.20 vs 1.00\u00b11.34, p=.15; MIR29B: 4.93\u00b14.68 vs 1.00\u00b11.05, p=.007). Conclusions: The t(6;7)(p25.3;q32.3) is the first recurrent translocation characterized in systemic and cutaneous ALK-negative ALCLs. This translocation was entirely specific for ALK-negative ALCLs, and was present in 45% of cases with 6p25.3 rearrangements. The t(6;7)(p25.3;q32.3) was associated with down-regulation of DUSP22 and up-regulation of MIR29 , but not dysregulation of IRF4 . DUSP22 inhibits mitogen activated protein kinase activity in T cells, and may represent a novel tumor suppressor in ALCLs. Increased MIR29 levels may additionally contribute to tumorigenesis, as recently shown in acute myeloid leukemias. Finally, clinical testing for t(6;7)(p25.3;q32.3) may aid in differentiating ALK-negative ALCL from other PTCLs. Our findings highlight the utility of mate-pair library sequencing to discover novel translocations in lymphoma and other cancers. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
