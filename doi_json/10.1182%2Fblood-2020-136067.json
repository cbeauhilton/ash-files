    "abstract_text": "Background CD19 redirected chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has proven efficacy in relapsed or chemotherapy-refractory (r/r) aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). However, targeting a single B-cell antigen leads to selective pressure with potential antigen-escape and subsequent relapse. A tandem CAR targeting CD20 and CD19 (pLTG1497) has been developed to overcome this limitation. Preclinical evaluation showed improved anti-lymphoma activity. Thus, we initiated a first-in-human, phase I clinical study of autologous pLTG1497-transduced CAR T-cells (MB-CART2019.1) in r/r B-NHL patients. Aims In this phase I prospective multi-center trial (NCT03870945) we aimed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MB-CART2019.1 in adult patients with CD20 and CD19 positive r/r B-NHL as determined by dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). Methods This was a 6+3 trial design with two predefined dose levels (DL1 1x10 6 and DL2 2.5x10 6 CAR T-cells/kg body weight, respectively). Secondary endpoints included adverse events (AEs) and best overall response rate (ORR). Pharmacodynamic assessments included maximum concentration (C max ) of CAR T-cells, time to peak expansion (t max ), AUC (d0 to d28), and persistence. MB-CART2019.1 was produced by lentiviral transduction of autologous fresh leukapheresis in the closed automated CliniMACS Prodigy \u00ae System (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Re-infusion (Day 0) of fresh MB-CART2019.1 was scheduled 14 days after leukapheresis. Fludarabine/cyclophosphamide lymphodepleting chemotherapy was administered from day -5 to -3. Results A total of 12 patients, 6 per dose level have been enrolled and treated between February and December 2019, 5 female and 7 male patients. Median age was 72 y (range 20, 78 y), with 10 patients >65 y and 8 >70 y. Histologies included aggressive B-NHL (11) and mantle cell lymphoma (1). Five (5) patients had refractory disease at study entry and IPI was \u22653 in 7 patients. Median time from leukapheresis to re-infusion was 14 d (range 13, 14 d). No DLT and no cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or neurotoxicity grade \u22653 were observed. One patient in dose level 1 experienced a grade 5 AE, which was due to disease progression. CRS grade 1 occurred in 3/6 patients on DL1 and DL2 each, and CRS grade 2 in 2 patients on DL2. Tocilizumab was given in 1 patient. Neurotoxicity grade 1 occurred in 1 patient on DL2. The above described CRS and neurotoxicity resolved completely. Mean C max of MB-CART2019.1 was 348.3 cells/\u00b5l (range 3.9, 830.4 cells/\u00b5l) on DL1 and 692 cells/\u00b5l (range 5.3, 3147.8 cells/\u00b5l) on DL2. Mean t max was 15.8 d (range 9, 21 d) on DL1 and 11.5 d (range 9, 14 d) on DL2. Mean AUC was 3155 d*cells/\u00b5l (DL1) and 4339 d*cells/\u00b5l (DL2). Persistence of MB-CART2019.1 was observed in 12/12 patients until data cut-off. Altogether 9/12 patients (ORR 75%) responded to MB-CART2019.1 with 5/12 CRs. In DL1 3/6 patients responded (ORR 50%) and in DL2 6/6 patients (ORR 100%). The 3 patients without response to MB-CART2019.1 had a mean AUC 0-28 of 870 d*cells/\u00b5l, whereas mean AUC 0-28 in 9 responders was 4843 d*cells/\u00b5l reflecting the correlation between the pharmacodynamic parameters and the clinical response. Responses are ongoing in 5/9 patients, with a maximum duration of response of 330 days at data cut-off. Summary/Conclusions In this first-in-human dose finding study of MB-CART2019.1 no DLT and no severe (grade \u22653) CRS or neurotoxicity were observed. Feasibility and safety were very good in this cohort of elderly r/r B-NHL patients. The sustained expansion of tandem CAR T-cells was accompanied by efficacy: all patients (6/6) treated on DL2 responded and all 5 patients with CR (5/5) are in ongoing remission by the time of this report. Based on the promising risk-to-benefit ratio observed in our study, evaluation of MB-CART2019.1 at a dose of 2.5x10 6 /kg body weight in clinical phase II and phase III trials for patients with relapsed aggressive B-NHL is underway.
