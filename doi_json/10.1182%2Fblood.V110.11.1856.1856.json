    "abstract_text": "We have previously shown that a monthly myelosuppressive chemotherapy proved superior to high-dose cytarabine consolidation therapy ( J Clin Oncol  2003 , 21 : 4496 ) after induction therapy and induction-type consolidation therapy. In the multicenter AMLCG 1999 trial, we reported that this maintenance therapy resulted in equal results with lower therapy-related morbidity and death-rate compared to autologous stem cell transplantation in patients <60 years of age. However, data about the feasibility and compliance of this prolonged maintenance therapy are still lacking. In the AMLCG 1999 trial, patients <60 years of age were randomized upfront to receive either an autologous stem cell transplantation or a maintenance therapy for three years from achievement of complete remission after consolidation therapy TAD. Patients \u226560 years of age were assigned to maintenance therapy following consolidation therapy. Maintenance courses were araC 100mg/m 2 q 12 hr sc \u00d7 10 and either daunorubicin 45mg/m 2 \u00d7 2 (AD), or thioguanine 100mg/m 2 q 12hr \u00d7 10 (AT), or cyclophosphamide 1g/m 2 iv (AC), and again AT-AD-AT-AC-. In patients with a leukopenia <1.000/\u03bcl or thrombocytopenia <20.000/\u03bcl after two following cycles, dosage was permanently reduced by 50%. Of all patients who achieved a CR before July 1 st 2004, 269 patients <60 years were randomized to receive maintenance, and all 423 patients \u226560 years were assigned to maintenance. Out of the 692 patients, 211 patients (30.5%) did not receive maintenance therapy due to: allogeneic (49, 7.1%) or autologous (6, 0.9%) stem cell transplantation, early relapse (52, 7.5%), withdrawal of consent (17, 2.5%), medical reasons other than relapse (53, 7.7%), other reasons not classified (7, 1.0%) or death in CR (27, 3.9%). In 78 patients (11.3%) the application of maintenance therapy cannot be followed due to loss of follow-up or incomplete documentation. For the remaining 403 (58.2%) patients with a documented start of the maintenance therapy, the median number of maintenance courses applied was 6 (1 st to 3 rd quartile: 2\u201316) over a median duration from achievement of CR of 10 months (1 st to 3 rd quartile: 5\u201324). Due to fixed dose adjustment rules, the median dosage of the applied chemotherapy declined from 90.5% (range 8.2\u2013183.3%) in the first course to 47.1% (range 6.6\u2013128.6%) in the third course. From the fifth course on, the median dosage was between 22.2 and 26.3%. Out of the 403 patients who started maintenance, therapy was terminated early in 346 patients (85.9%) due to: an allogeneic stem cell transplantation in 1 st CR (3 patients, 0.7%); relapse (175, 43.4%); withdrawal of consent (17, 4.2%); medical reasons other than relapse (72, 17.9%); other reasons not classified (13, 3.2%), loss of follow-up or incomplete documentation (56, 13.9%); and death in CR (10, 2.5%). Of the latter, 5 patients (1.2%) succumbed to therapy-related death. Of the 129 patients experiencing a relapse free survival of \u2265 three years, the median number of applied courses was 20 (1 st to 3 rd quartile: 4\u201329) over a median duration of 31 months after achieving CR (1 st to 3 rd quartile: 11\u201336). Taken together, this results show that a prolonged monthly myelosuppressive maintenance therapy as part of a postremission therapy in AML is feasible and shows a high compliance and acceptance among patients.",
