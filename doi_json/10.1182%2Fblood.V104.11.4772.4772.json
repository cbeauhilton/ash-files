    "abstract_text": "Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may develop other B cell malignancies in their clinical course including aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and rarely myelomas. In a large proportion of cases, the secondary B cell malignancies reflected the emergence of immunophenotypically and genetically different clones. An immature type plasma cell myeloma developed in a 73-year-old female patient in whom CLL was diagnosed four years previously. The CLL expressed CD5, CD19, CD23, CD38 and surface kappa light chain, but were negative for ZAP-70. Trisomy 12 was detected by FISH analysis. PCR analysis of the peripheral blood for immunoglobulin heavy chain genes demonstrated two sharp bands that were initially interpreted as biallelic heavy chain gene rearrangements. Myeloma cells were CD38 and CD138 positive, CD19 negative and expressed cytoplasmic kappa light chain, but not heavy chains. In order to investigate the clonal relationship between these B cell malignancies, a detailed analysis of V H DJ H and V\u03baJ\u03ba gene rearrangements in individually sorted CD5 and CD19 double-positive CLL cells and also in CD38-positive and CD19-negative myeloma cells by single cell PCR of genomic DNA and direct sequencing was carried out. This technique permitted identification and pairing of both the heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes from the same individually sorted cell. A total of 17 individual CLL and 23 myeloma cells were successfully analyzed. Our analysis demonstrated (a) the presence of two discrete clones of CLL, one with usage of [VH1-2*04/D3-3*01/J3*02]-[V\u03ba2-28*01/J1*01] without V H and V\u03ba hypermutation and the other with usage of [VH1-2*04/D4-11*01/J6*02]-[V\u03ba1-5*03/J1*01] with V H and V\u03bahypermutation; (b) no clonal relationship between the CLL and myeloma cells that utilized different V H DJ H and V\u03baJ\u03ba rearrangements [VH3-66*02/3-10*01/J4*03]-[V\u03ba1-33*01/J2*02] with V H and V\u03ba hypermutation. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a biclonal CLL with mutated and unmutated clones in the same patient along with a third clonally unrelated B cell malignancy. This result suggests that single cell analysis may be necessary to detect subtle biclonality of CLL that might be associated with a more aggressive phenotype.",
