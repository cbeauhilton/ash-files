    "abstract_text": "Suppression of T-cell immunity seen in children with inherited purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency supports the potential application of PNP inhibitors for the therapy of T-cell malignancies. Forodesine (Fodosine TM ) is a specific PNP inhibitor that raises plasma 2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (dGuo) and intracellular dGTP levels, leading to T-cell apoptosis. IV administration of forodesine has shown activity in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) patients. To determine the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral forodesine in patients with refractory CTCL, as well as preliminary evidence of efficacy, five cohorts of patients (\u2265 3patients per cohort) were evaluated sequentially, receiving forodesine at 40, 80, 160, 320, and 480 mg/m 2 once per day for 28 days. At the end of the treatment cycle (Day 28), all patients with stable or improved disease could enter a long-term, follow-up period. To date, 12 patients have been treated, 11 completing the 28-day cycle. Forodesine is orally absorbed (40%\u201350%), mean terminal half-life of 12 to 20 h. dGuo levels were elevated in all patients (0.8\u20132.8 \u03bcM, predose levels \u2264 0.004 \u03bcM). Forodesine was generally safe and well tolerated in this population. Safety data is available for first 7 patients. No serious adverse events possibly related to the drug occurred. The most common adverse event possibly drug related was nausea (2 patients). Of the 11 patients completing the treatment cycle, 9 began long-term treatment. Of these 9 patients, 4 have received >3 months of treatment, while 1 patient continues to receive for >8 months. Efficacy data are available for 8 patients: 2 with partial response, 3 with minor response, 2 with progressive disease, and 1 with stable disease (Table). Forodesine showed preliminary evidence of clinical activity in refractory CTCL patients. Additional clinical and pharmacodynamic data will be presented.
