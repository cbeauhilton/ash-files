    "abstract_text": "Background: BAY 79-4980 refers to recombinant FVIII (rFVIII; Kogenate \u00ae -FS, KGFS) reconstituted with a PEGylated Liposome diluent. rFVIII binds non-covalently but with high affinity on the external surface of the PEGylated Liposome and retains procoagulant activity and normal vWF binding in vitro. In initial in vivo experiments in hemophilia A mice (FVIII \u2212/\u2212) subject to multiple tail clippings, hemostatic activity with BAY 79-4980 was augmented compared to FVIII alone. In the current studies, a more extensive pharmacologic analysis of BAY 79-4980 was performed in Hemophilia A mice using an acute FVIII dependent bleeding model (Landskroner et al). Objectives: To more thoroughly evaluate the pharmacologic properties of BAY 79-4980 using an acute FVIII dependent bleed model in the hemophilic A mouse. We examined BAY-4980 under three conditions: (1) Prophylaxis treatment, where drug is administered via the jugular vein and 5 minutes later the tail is transected; (2) On demand treatment, where drug is administered 3\u20135 minutes after the tail is severed and bleeding is extant; (3) PK/PD, where drug is administered via tail vein and 4 or 24 hrs is allowed to elapse before the tail is severed. Methods: Hemophilia A mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, the tail is then warmed and the right jugular vein is exposed. At t = 0 the tail is cut by a scalpel and the transected tail is placed back into a new tube of warmed saline (37\u201340\u00b0C). Blood is collected over 40 minutes into the plastic tubes and blood loss is measured gravimetrically. In all studies, BAY 79-4980 is compared with a similar dose of KGFS measured in chromogenic units/mouse. The data is analyzed in two ways; (1) the quantity (\u03bcl) of blood lost over 40 minutes and the frequency (% of mice) in the respective treatment group bleeding >150 \u03bcl. The 150 \u03bcl value is used as a cut-off value to determine a real bleeding event. This value was derived from the mean + 2.5 SD of bleeding in control (C57BL) mice administered 5% albumin. Results: With Prophylaxis treatment at 2.5 U/mouse, blood loss was 205 \u00b1 59 \u03bcl with KGFS and 62 \u00b1 16 \u03bcl with BAY 79-4980 (P = 0.12). Percentage of animals protected was not significantly different (73% versus 93%, respectively). With on demand treatment at 1 and 2.5 U/mouse, the results were 660 \u00b1 69 \u03bcl with KGFS and 447 \u00b1 69 \u03bcl with BAY 79-4980 (P = 0.02) at 1 U/mouse and 466 \u00b1 107 \u03bcl with KGFS and 211 \u00b1 52 \u03bcl with BAY 79-4980 at 2.5 U/mouse. The percent protected was 10% versus 36% at 1 U/mouse and 47% versus 60% at 2.5 U/mouse, respectively. When drug was administered at 2.5 U and 4 hours was allowed to elapse the results were 432 \u00b1 102 \u03bcl with KGFS and 187 \u00b1 70 \u03bcl with BAY 79-4980 (P = 0.04), and the percentage of mice protected was 47% and 73%, respectively. When drug was administered at a dose of 8 U/mouse and the tail was cut at 24 hours, the results were 822 \u00b1 97 \u03bcl with KGFS and 395 \u00b1 112 \u03bcl with BAY 79-4980 (P = 0.02), and the percentage of mice protected was 13% versus 53%, respectively (P = 0.05). Conclusions: These results demonstrate that BAY 79-4980 has good hemostatic activity when administered acutely compared to KGFS. It appeared that under certain conditions, BAY 79-4980 exhibited enhanced hemostatic benefit, even when administered acutely. When BAY 79-4980 was administered prophylactically and 4 or 24 hours was allowed to elapse, enhanced hemostatic activity was demonstrated compared to KGFS alone.",
