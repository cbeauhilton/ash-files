    "abstract_text": "The results of cytogenetics are one of the most important prognostic factors in the prognosis of AML. Three different post remission therapies were given with the IPG based on the MRC definitions using the cytogenetics results. The inclusion criteria included age50%, bilirubin<2.0mg/dl, creatinine<2mg/dl in de novo AML and secondary AML. The aims of this prospective intention to treat analysis were to compare the CR, recovery kinetics, DFS and OS in IPG based on cytogenetics with 3 different consolidation treatment modalities described as follows. Three plus seven(Idarubicin 12mg/m 2 , D1-D3; Ara-C 100mg/m 2 , D1\u2013D7) were given to de novo AML and secondary AML. HDAC followed by three times of post remission therapy or auto PBPCT followed by two times of post remission therapy was given to IPG. If an HLA-identical sibling were available, then allo BMT was tried after 1st post-remission therapy. The median age of the cohort(Total 194) is 42.5(\u00b117.6) (HDAC(n:89) : 47.6, auto PBPCT(n:51) : 46.6, and allo BMT(n:54) : 30.5). The median days for ANC >500/\u03bcl and platelet>20k/\u03bcl during induction were 22 days and 21 days respectively. Grade 3~4 toxicities were found in 34.1%, 27.7% and 47.2% during HDAC, auto PBPCT and allo BMT, respetively(p<0.05). The relapse rate and the toxic death rate were 25.8%, 27.5% and 29.6%(p=0.24) and 9.1%, 5.5% and 16.6%(p<0.05) in HDAC, auto PBPCT and allo BMT, respectively. So far, this trial seems to be tolerable in terms of toxicities, during induction and post remission therapies. Among IPG, the auto PBPCT arm had a tendency of superior median survival over the HDAC or allo BMT in terms of OS and LFS without statistical differences(HDAC:17m and 8m, auto-PBPCT:18m and 12m, allograft:15m and 8m). This intention to treat trial, which started in Jan, 2000, has proceeded until now in order to have better statistical power for the subset analysis."
