    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3565 Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (ETCL) is a rare lymphoma often, but not always, associated with celiac disease and characterized by poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy. In previous studies long-term survival has been achieved in only 10\u201320% of the patients. Limited data is available on the feasibility and efficacy of intensive induction chemotherapy followed by autologous stem transplantation (ASCT) in this rare lymphoma entity. We therefore specifically analysed the outcome of ETCL patients included in a large prospective phase II study (NLG-T-01) performed by the Nordic Lymphoma Group. The NLG-T-01 study included 160 patients with systemic alk-negative peripheral T-cell lymphoma over the period 2002\u20132007. The patients received CHOEP-14 \u00d7 6 followed by ASCT after BEAM or BEAC in responsive patients. The study included altogether 21 patients (13 %) with ETCL. There were 16 males and 5 females with a median age of 55 years (32-65) at diagnosis. Eighteen patients (86 %) had advanced disease, three patients (14 %) had a bulky tumour, nine patients (43 %) presented with B symptoms and four (19%) with elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase. Response status after three and six courses was CR or CRu in 67 % patients. Fourteen patients (67 %) received BEAM or BEAC supported by blood stem cell graft (median number of stem cells infused 5.4 \u00d7 10 6 /kg). Of these, 6 patients relapsed with a median of 219 days from ASCT. Of the 7 patients (33%), who did not reach ASCT because of refractory/progressive disease, 5 died early due to lymphoma. At a median follow-up of 45 months, 10 patients (45 %) are alive. The progression-free survival is 40 %. One patient (5%) died due to early transplant-related cause (disseminated candidiasis). In this prospective study, intensive induction chemotherapy followed by ASCT was feasible in the majority of younger patients with EATL. In a subset of patients, who should clinically and biologically be further characterized, long-term outcome seems promising when compared to historical controls. Whether addition of other chemotherapeutic agents, antibodies such as alemtuzumab or other biologicals may further improve long-term outcome remains to be studied.
