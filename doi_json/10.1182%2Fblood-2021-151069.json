    "abstract_text": "Accumulating evidence suggest that the axon guidance molecules SLIT and ROBO are not only implicated in physiological process but also in cancer progression. Depending on the type of cancer the SLIT - ROBO axis can either act as a tumor suppressor gene, in which case the SLIT2 promoter site is frequently hypermethylated or as an oncogene, whereby high expression is often associated with poor prognosis. In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), low expression of SLIT2 has been associated with low overall survival (OS) (Golos et al., 2019), while the functional role of SLIT2 remains largely unknown. Recently, we showed that the knockdown of SLIT2 increased cell proliferation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells resulting in a more aggressive course of disease progression in vivo using the murine transgenic APL model (Weinh\u00e4user et al., 2020). Here, we aimed to study the functional role of SLIT2 in a more heterogeneous disease, such as AML. Using different publicly available datasets. (GSE58477, normal karyotype blasts: 62, healthy CD34 + : 10; GSE63409, LSC: 14, HSC: 5) we detected increased methylation at the SLIT2 promoter site of AML leukemic cells compared to healthy CD34 + cells suggesting SLIT2 tumor suppressive functions. In addition, we measured decreased levels of SLIT2 in the bone marrow (BM) plasma of AML patients compared to healthy donors. To assess the biological role of SLIT2, we treated AML cell lines (KASUMI1, MV411, and MOLM13) with recombinant SLIT2 (50 ng/mL) in vitro . Administration of SLIT2 reduced AML cell growth, colony formation and induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase for all AML cell lines. Conversely, the knockdown of SLIT2 promoted increased THP-1 and OCI-AML3 cell proliferation. Next, we determined whether the treatment with SLIT2 could delay leukemogenesis in vivo using the AML cell line MV4-11. Engraftment was monitored by luciferase bioluminescent signal and NSGS mice were either treated with recombinant SLIT2 using a dose of 25 ng/g of body weight or vehicle (control group). SLIT2 therapy resulted in a lower disease burden, decreased leukemic infiltration in the BM and spleen, reduced spleen size, and increased OS compared to the control group (p<0.05). In conclusion, we showed that SLIT2 methylation is recurrent in AML patients and that the level of SLIT2 in the plasma of AML patients is reduced. Moreover, SLIT2 treatment appears to have a cytostatic effect on different AML cell lines delaying leukemogenesis in vivo . Overall, our study reveals the therapeutic potential of SLIT2 in hematological malignancies, which could be used as an adjuvant in the clinic.
