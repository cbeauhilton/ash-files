    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2780 Introduction: Refractory cytopenia in childhood (RCC) is the most common subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in children. Differential diagnosis from inherited bone marrow failure (IBMF) such as Fanconi anemia (FA) remains an intriguing challenge, because most patients with RCC have a hypocellular bone marrow (BM) and dysplastic features in haematopoiesis are observed in both RCC and IBMF. Moreover the spectrum of phenotypic findings in FA is extremely wide. Some FA patients have a mild phenotype without malformation. The purpose of this study is to estimate the incidence of FA in an RCC cohort without a full clinical feature of FA, but subsequently diagnosed by chromosome breaking test. Patients and Methods: Between 01/2007 and 12/2010 reference pathologists of the European Working Group of MDS in Childhood (EWOG-MDS) provided a morphological report consistent with RCC in 137 children studied in Germany. Seventeen patients with hypercellular BM or abnormal karyotype, 2 patients, in whom dyskeratosis congenital was diagnosed after initial inclusion and one patient, in whom chromosome breaking test was not performed, were excluded. Results: Seven of remaining 117 patients had facial and/or skeletal anomalies typically noted in FA and one patient had a brother with FA. In these 8 patients, FA had been suspected by their local physicians (group FA-1). Nine patients (8.3%) without these typical anomalies were subsequently diagnosed of FA by chromosome breakage test (group FA-2). The diagnosis of RCC was finally made in the remaining 100 patients with negative chromosomal breakage test (group RCC). The clinical features of patients in each group are summarized in the Table. The mean corpuscular volume of red cells (MCV) was elevated (> +2SD) for ages in all patients with FA, but only 42 % in patient with RCC. In some children of group FA-2 additional non-haematological abnormalities were also observed. However, they were not evident and or typical to prompt the treating physicians to suspect FA. A few patients in the group RCC also had some physical anomalies, not specific for any of the known IBMF disorders. Possibly that other known or not yet described IBMF disorders remain uncovered in children with \u201c de novo \u201d RCC. Conclusion: Our results illustrate that the same haematological features and congenital anomalies can be noted in FA and RCC. More importantly, they indicate that the exclusion of FA by a chromosomal breakage test or other methods is mandatory in all patients prior to diagnosis RCC. Chromosomal breakage analysis may identify patients with FA in 8% of patients with a morphological description of RCC without a full clinical picture of FA. Table.
