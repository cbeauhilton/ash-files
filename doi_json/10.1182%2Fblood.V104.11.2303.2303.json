    "abstract_text": "Syngeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a rare situation and is usually characterised by a high relapse rate because of the absence of graft versus leukaemia effect. We report results of syngeneic HSCT reported to the EBMT registry from 1975 to 2003. One hundred and 24 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 104 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were reported comprising 150 adults and 78 children, 133 males and 95 females. The number of patients in first complete remission (CR1) was 137, comprising 93 AML (72 adults and 21 children) and 44 ALL (33 adults and 11 children). The number of patients in second complete remission (CR2) was 52 comprising 12 AML (9 adults and 3 children) and 40 ALL (11 adults and 29 children). The number of patients in more advanced disease (AD) was 39 comprising 19 AML (16 adults and 3 children) and 20 ALL (9 adults and 11 children). Total body irradiation was given to 36% of patients. Prophylaxis of graft versus host disease was given to 10% of patients. Source of stem cells was bone marrow for 81% of patients, peripheral blood for 18% and both for 1%. Outcome at 5 years showed for adult patients with AML in CR1 (n=72) a leukaemia free survival (LFS) of 56+/\u22127%, a relapse incidence (RI) of 37+/\u22127% and a non relapse mortality (NMR) of 11+/\u22125%. For adult patients with ALL in CR1 (n=33), LFS was 60+/\u221210%, RI 38+/\u221210% and NRM 3+/\u22123%. Outcome at 5 years showed for children with AML in CR1 (n=21) a LFS of 61+/\u221211%, a RI of 39+/\u221211% and a NMR of 0%. For children with ALL in CR2 (n=29), LFS was 46+/\u221210%, RI 52+/\u221210% and NRM 5+/\u22125%. Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) was diagnosed in 12% of patients, 7% grade 1 and 5% grade \u2265 2. Chronic GVHD was observed in 2% of patients. These retrospective study indicates that syngeneic HSCT can lead to a high LFS in patients with acute leukaemia in CR1 and that GVHD is not a rare event. A graft versus leukemia effect is highly probable in syngeneic HSCT.",
