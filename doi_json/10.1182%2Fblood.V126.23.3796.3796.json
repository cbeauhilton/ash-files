    "abstract_text": "Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 are frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), glioma, and many other cancers. While wild-type IDHs convert isocitrate to \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG), mutant IDHs convert \u03b1-KG to oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which dysregulates a set of \u03b1-KG-dependent dioxygenases, such as TETs, histone demethylases, EGLNs, and other enzymes. Because the role of mutant IDH is not necessary for normal cells, inhibitors directed against mutant IDH are not expected to have the side effects as those of anti-cancer agents. To determine whether mutant IDH enzymes are valid targets for cancer therapy, we created a mouse model of mutant IDH-dependent AML. Previously, the IDH mutation alone was shown to be insufficient for the induction of AML, and IDH mutations occur simultaneously with mutations in other genes such as NPM, DNMT3A , and FLT3 . In accordance with these observations, we found that NPM +/- hematopoietic progenitor cells transduced with IDH2/R140Q, NPMc, DNMT3A/R882H, and FLT3/ITD cooperatively induced AML in a mouse model. However, when only three of these mutant genes were transduced, myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) rather than AML was more frequently induced and their onset was delayed in any combinations of the mutant genes. These results clearly indicate that all four mutations are necessary for the efficient induction of AML. By using a combination of AML model mice with cre-loxp, we conditionally deleted IDH2/R140Q from AML mice, which blocked 2-HG production and resulted in the loss of leukemia stem cells. Accordingly, the progression of AML was significantly delayed. These results indicate that the function of IDH2 mutation is critical for the development and maintenance of AML stem cells, and that mutant IDHs are promising targets for anticancer therapy. Based on these findings, we developed potent and specific inhibitors of mutant IDH1 and tested their effects in the mutant IDH1-dependent AML mouse model, created by introducing four mutant genes including mutant IDH1. The 2HG level was promptly and dramatically decreased in AML cells soon after treatment with the mutant IDH1 inhibitors, and the number of leukemia cells was reduced after a 4-week treatment. These results indicate that IDH1 mutant inhibitors are effective for the treatment for AML. Because IDH mutations and TET2 mutations are mutually exclusive in AML, the inhibition of TET-mediated conversion of 5mC to 5hmC is considered one of the main roles of mutant IDH. We found that levels of 5hmC on differentiation-inducing genes, such as Ebf1, Spib and Pax5 were decreased in AML cells with IDH2/R140Q and recovered by conditional deletion of IDH2/R140Q. In consistent with levels of 5hmC, expressions of these genes are downregulated in the AML cells and increased by deletion of IDH2/R140Q. Gene expression analysis revealed that IDH2/R140Q up-regulates a set of genes that is activated in response to hypoxia as well as Meis1. As 2HG inhibits EGLN that hydroxylates and marks HIF1\u03b1 for ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation, it is probable that mutant IDH2-produced 2HG stabilizes HIF1\u03b1 through inhibition of EGLN. Furthermore, it was reported that Meis1 activates the transcription of HIF1\u03b1. In consistent with these information, we showed that IDH2/R140Q increased the protein levels of HIF1\u03b1 in cultured cells. Disclosures Matsunaga: Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.: Employment.
