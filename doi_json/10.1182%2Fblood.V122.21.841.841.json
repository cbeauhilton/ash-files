    "abstract_text": "Background IL-10 polarized macrophages promote tumor growth and survival. The T-cell transcription factor GATA binding protein-3 (GATA3) epigenetically regulates IL10 expression. Therefore, we investigated the extent to which GATA-3 regulates IL-10 production and macrophage polarization in T-cell lymphomas. Methods Monocyte-derived macrophages were generated and polarized with T-cell lymphoma conditioned media ((TCL-CM). Immunophenotypic and functional characteristics associated with IL10-polarized macrophages were examined. GATA3-dependent cytokine production was evaluated in T-cell lymphoma lines by shRNA knockdown. Alternatively polarized macrophages and GATA3 expression were examined in a cohort of patients with peripheral T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS) (n=76). Comparisons among groups were evaluated using a Student's t test. Progression-free and overall survival (PFS & OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and two-tailed log-rank test based on Cox proportional hazards model. Results To investigate the ability of T-cell lymphomas to alternatively polarize macrophages, monocytes from healthy donors were cocultured with TCL-CM. Macrophages were shown to have immunophenotypic characteristics of IL10-polarized macrophages (pSTAT3 + /CD16 hi /CD163 hi /HLA-DR -/lo ) by flow cytometry, which was abrogated by IL10, but not IL6, neutralization. TCL-CM polarized macrophages produced abundant IL-10 and were impaired in their ability to stimulate T-cell proliferation. Collectively, these results demonstrate that T-cell lymphomas promote alternative macrophage polarization in an IL-10 dependent manner, and both CD163 and pSTAT3 may aid in their identification in clinical T-cell lymphoma specimens. Therefore, CD163+/pSTAT3+ macrophages were visualized by immunofluorescence in PTCL, NOS specimens. IL-10 polarized macrophages were not identified in normal tissues, but were abundant constituents of the tumor microenvironment in 68% of the PTCL, NOS specimens examined (n=31). STAT3 phosphorylation in response to IL-10 is dependent upon the Janus kinases (JAK) JAK1 and TYK2, both of which are inhibited at nanomolar (and clinically achievable) concentrations by the \u201cJAK2\u201d inhibitor ruxolitinib. Therefore, we sought to determine whether ruxolitinib may prevent IL-10-induced macrophage polarization. As expected, ruxolitinib inhibited IL-10-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. More importantly, macrophages polarized in the presence of ruxolitinib lost the immunophenotype characteristics of IL-10 polarized macrophages, and were CD16 -/lo CD163 -/lo HLA-DR hi . Furthermore, IL-10 production was significantly impaired in macrophages polarized in the presence of ruxolitinib, while their ability to stimulate T-cell proliferation was significantly increased. In a separate initiative, we identified GATA3 as the key regulator of IL-10 and Th2 cytokine (IL-4, IL-13 and IL-5) expression in T-cell lymphoma lines by shRNA knockdown assays. Therefore, we examined GATA3 expression by immunohistochemistry in PTCL, NOS specimens. GATA-3 expression was observed in most of the T-cell lymphoma lines and in 47% of PTCL, NOS specimens (n=76). In the cohort of the 76 PTCL, NOS patients, the median PFS and OS observed in GATA3+ PTCL, NOS was 5 months (4-8 months, 95% CI) and 8 months (5-14 months, 95% CI), respectively. In contrast, the median PFS and OS in GATA3- PTCL, NOS was 1.3 years (0.6-1.6, 95% CI) and 1.6 years (0.7-6.9 95% CI), respectively. Conclusions Alternatively polarized macrophages are abundant in T-cell lymphomas and are generated in an IL-10- and STAT3-dependent manner. GATA-3 regulates IL-10 production in these lymphomas, and its expression identified a high-risk subset of PTCL, NOS with distinct clinicopathological features. As IL-10-dependent STAT3 phosphorylation and macrophage polarization were impaired by ruxolitinib, the JAK2 inhibitors may warrant closer scrutiny as immunomodulatory agents.
