    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5165 Introduction: Most deaths in thalassemia major (TM) result from cardiac complications due to iron overload. No data are available in literature about possible different changes in cardiac and liver iron in TM patients treated with sequential deferiprone\u2013deferoxamine (DFP-DFO) versus deferasirox (DFX). Magnetic Resonance (MR) is the unique non invasive suitable technique to evaluated quantitatively this issue. The aim of this multi-centre study was to assess prospectively in the clinical practice the efficacy of the DFP-DFO vs DFX in a cohort of TM patients by quantitative MR. Methods: Among the first 739 TM patients enrolled in the MIOT (Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassemia) network, 253 patients performed a MR follow up study at 18 \u00b1 3 months according to the protocol. We evaluated prospectively the 25 patients treated with DFP-DFO versus the 44 patients treated with DFX between the 2 MR scans. Myocardial and liver iron concentrations were measured by T2* multislice multiecho technique. Results: The doses of the sequential treatment were DFP 70\u00b114 mg/kg/d for 4 d/w and DFO 42\u00b18 mg/kg/d for 3 d/w, the dose of DFX was 26\u00b16 mg/kg/d. Excellent/good levels of compliance were similar in the 2 groups (DFP-DFO 96% vs DFX 100%; P = 0.36). At baseline the 2 groups were homogeneous for cardiac and liver iron. Among the patients with no significant myocardial iron overload at baseline (global heart T2* 3 20 ms), there were no significant differences between groups to maintain the patients without myocardial iron overload (DFP-DFO 95% vs DFX 96%; P = 1.0). Among the patients with myocardial iron overload at baseline (global heart T2* < 20 ms), only in the DFX group there was a significant improvement in the global heart T2* value (11 \u00b1 5 ms at baseline versus 16 \u00b1 8 at 18 \u00b1 3 months, P = 0.0001) and in the number of segment with a normal T2* value ( P = 0.003). The improvement in the global heart T2* was not significantly difference in the DFP-DFO versus the DFX group (mean difference global heart T2* 2.2 \u00b1 4.1 ms versus 4.6 \u00b1 4.8 P = 0.2). The changes in the mean serum ferritin level were not significantly different between groups. In patients with liver iron overload at baseline (liver T2* < 5.1 ms), the change in the liver T2* was not significant between groups (mean difference liver T2* 0.9 \u00b1 2.1 ms vs 2.4 \u00b1 5.2; P = 0.3). Conclusions: Prospectively in the clinical setting over 15 months we did not find significant differences on cardiac and liver iron by quantitative MRI in TM patients treated with sequential DFP\u2013DFO versus the TM patients treated with DFX.
