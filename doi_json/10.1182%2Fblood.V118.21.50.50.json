    "abstract_text": "Abstract 50 Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) is a rare bone marrow failure syndrome showing considerable genetic and clinical heterogeneity. The most common form is the X-linked form due to mutations in the DKC1 gene encoding dyskerin, a protein important in telomere maintenance and ribosomal RNA biogenesis. Six other genes, all of whose products are involved in telomere maintenance, have been shown to be mutated in DC, together the seven genes accounting for about half of the known cases. The X-linked form can cause severe disease for which therapeutic options are limited. It is known that mutant dyskerin destabilizes telomerase RNA leading to rapidly shortening telomeres, accelerated stem cell aging and bone marrow failure. However the precise mechanism by which this occurs is not known. So far studies of the cell biology of DC stem and progenitor cells have been hampered by their scarcity in patients and their short life span and attempts to create mouse models have suffered from differences in telomere biology between mouse and human. An alternative approach that has recently become feasible is the production of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from patient fibroblasts that can then be used to investigate disease pathogenesis. Accordingly we generated iPSC from skin fibroblast from X-linked DC patients carrying DKC1 mutations Q31E, \u03b437A and 353V, and by using the classical OCT4, KLF4, SOX2 and cMYC 4-transcription factor system. Of particular interest is the A353V mutation since this is a recurrent mutation and accounts for about 40% of DKC1 mutations. In total, we obtained two Q31E clones, three \u03b437 clones and eight A353V clones. We found that all these DKC1 mutant iPS cells express decreased levels of dyskerin, in agreement with our mouse studies that show mutant proteins are relatively unstable. Mutant iPSC have very low levels of TERC (only 20\u201330% of the levels in WT iPSC) while TERT expression is the same as in WT cells. By using the TRAP assay, we found that both A353V and \u03b437 iPSC showed dramatically decreased telomerase activity; only 10\u201320 % compared to WT iPSC. After measuring the telomere length of both patient skin fibroblast cells and DKC1 mutant iPSC, we found A353V and \u03b437 iPSC lost the ability to elongate the telomere end during iPSC reprogramming while WT iPSC showed significantly increased telomere length compared to WT skin fibroblast cells. These results indicated that DKC1 iPSC are defective in telomere maintenance. In terms of ribosome biogenesis, we found that some snoRNA expression was slightly decreased including H/ACA snoRNAs E2, E3, U69, ACA10 and scaRNAs U90 and U93 while all C/D snoRNA we investigated were unchanged compared with WT iPS cells. We also found that DKC1 mutant iPS cells did not show significantly changes in ribosomal profiles or in the kinetics of rRNA processing. Together these results suggest that the iPSC faithfully reproduce the molecular features of the human disease and will prove to be a useful tool in investigations of the pathogenesis and treatment of DC.
