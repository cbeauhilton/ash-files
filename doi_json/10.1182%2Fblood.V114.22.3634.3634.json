    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3634 Poster Board III-570 Specialized niches, in which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside control the balance between HSC quiescence and self-renewal, yet little is known about the extrinsic signals provided by the niche and how these niche signals regulate such a balance. Activation of the fibrinolytic pathway via matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) resulted in the release of kit ligand (KitL) in the BM niche. Membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP) can activate e.g. MMP-9. To investigate the role of MT1-MMP in hematopoiesis, we used MT1-MMP deficient mice. MT1-MMP\u2212/\u2212 mice examined 12 days after birth showed pancytopenia and reduced numbers of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) and splenocytes. BM cytospins from MT1-MMP\u2212/\u2212 mice showed mild perturbations in erythropoiesis and a more severe impairment of myelopoiesis. Although all lineages were present, the ratio of erythroid to myeloid precursors increased from 0.36 in wildtype to 0.60 in MT1-MMP\u2212/\u2212 mice. Myeloid and erythroid cell differentiation was impaired in MT1-MMP\u2212/\u2212 BMMCs. The numbers of colony forming unit cells (CFU-C) was reduced in MT1-MMP\u2212/\u2212 BMMCs. In contrary, the number of immature hematopoietic cells (CFU-S8, KSL cells) was augmented in MT1-MMP\u2212/\u2212 BMMCs. FACS analysis of BM cells showed a decrease in the percentage of mature B cells with an increase number of Pro-B and immature B cells in MT1-MMP\u2212/\u2212 BMMCs relative to controls. MT1-MMP\u2212/\u2212 BM cells showed lower expression of CXCL12 and KitL, typical niche growth factors important for myelopoiesis and lymphopoisis. Thus, MT1-MMP is required for normal hematopoietic differentiation of lymphoid and myeloid lineage cells, most likely due to growth factor defective niche cells.
