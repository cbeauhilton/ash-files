    "abstract_text": "Background: TP53 is altered in ~50% of human cancers. Alterations include mutations and deletions. Both frequently occur together, supporting the classical \"two-hit\" hypothesis for tumor-suppressor genes. Aim: Comparison of TP53 mutation/deletion patterns in different hematological malignancies, including AML, MDS, ALL, Burkitt lymphoma, CLL and T-PLL. We analyzed (i) the frequencies of TP53 mutations and deletions, (ii) the types of mutation, (iii) the mutation load, (iv) the correlations to cytogenetic aberrations, (v) the age dependency, and (vi) impact on survival. Patient cohort and methods: A total of 3383 cases (AML: n=858, MDS: n=943, ALL: n=358, Burkitt lymphoma: n=25, CLL: n=1148 and T-PLL: n=51) were analyzed for TP53 deletions by interphase FISH determining the copy number state and for TP53 mutations by next-generation amplicon deep sequencing. Karyotype data was available for all cases. Results: Overall, alterations in TP53 were detected in 361/3383 cases (11%; 186 cases with mutation only (mut only), 51 cases with deletion only (del only), 124 cases with mutation and deletion (mut+del)). Regarding the respective entities, the highest frequency of TP53 alterations was observed in patients with Burkitt lymphoma (total alteration frequency: 56%, mut+del: 12%, mut only: 44%, no case del only). Alterations in TP53 also occured with a high incidence in patients with T-PLL (total: 30%; mut+del: 10%; mut only: 4%; del only: 16%) followed by cases with ALL (total: 19%; mut+del: 6%; mut only: 8%; del only: 5%) and AML (total: 13%; mut+del: 5%; mut only: 7%; del only: 1%). By contrast, TP53 alterations occurred less frequently in patients with CLL (total: 8%; mut+del: 4%; mut only: 3%; del only: 1%) and MDS (total: 7%; mut+del: 1%; mut only: 5%; del only: 1%). Missense mutations were found to be the most abundant mutation type in all entities analyzed with a frequency ranging from 71% - 88%. In all entities mainly one mutation per case was detected; however, MDS cases were found to harbour a statistically increased proportion of cases with two mutations compared to the other entities (p = 0.003). High TP53 mutation loads were detected in T-PLL (median: 88%) and AML (47%), whereas the lower ones were found in ALL (28%), Burkitt lymphoma (39%), MDS (39%), and CLL (36%). A strong correlation of TP53 alterations with a complex karyotype was observed in AML (of patients with TP53 alteration: 5% with normal karyotype, 67% with complex karyotype, 28% with other aberrations), ALL (16% normal, 45% complex, 39% other), MDS (14% normal, 53% complex, 33% other), and T-PLL (20% normal, 47% complex, 33% other). By contrast, in CLL and Burkitt lymphoma, TP53 alterations were mainly correlated with other aberrations (CLL: 10% normal, 30% complex, 60% other; Burkitt: 29% normal, 0% complex, 71% other). TP53 mut and TP53 mut+del were significantly more frequent in patients \u2265 60 vs < 60 years in AML (9% vs. 2% for mut only, p < 0.001; 7% vs. 2% for mut+del, p = 0.001) and ALL (12% vs. 6% for mut only, p < 0.001; 13% vs. 3% for mut+del, p = 0.001). By contrast, no such differences were observed for patients with CLL, MDS, T-PLL and Burkitt lymphoma. Moreover, TP53 alterations (especially of TP53 mut+del) had a significant negative impact on OS in all entities except for T-PLL and Burkitt lymphoma, most probably due to their overall short OS or due the lower number of cases. Conclusion: The frequency of TP53 mutations and/or deletions as well as the mutation load clearly varied between different hematological malignancies with the highest incidence of TP53 mut in patients with Burkitt lymphoma (56%) and a rather low frequency in CLL (7%) and MDS (6%). TP53 del were frequent in patients with T-PLL (26%) and Burkitt lymphoma (12%) and are hardly found in MDS cases (2%). TP53 alterations are correlated to higher age in AML and ALL. Moreover, alterations in TP53 are correlated to a short OS and to a complex karyotype, with the exception of Burkitt lymphoma and CLL, were they were found to be associated to other cytogenetic aberrations. Thus, TP53 mutations and deletions need further investigation in the future, especially regarding their clinical impact in different hematologic entities.
