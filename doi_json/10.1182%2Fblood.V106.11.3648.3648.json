    "abstract_text": "During erythropoiesis and human development different globin genes (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 and \u03b5) are expressed as a result of globin gene switching. We investigated globin gene expression in comparison to the expression of other genes in erythroid progenitor cells (EPC) during ontogenesis using in-house produced microarrays containing 16,659 oligonucleotides. Human primitive CD34 + cells were isolated from fetal liver (FL), cord blood (CB), adult bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB) and mobilized peripheral blood (mPB), and developed into EPC in the presence of erythropoietin and other cytokines. The differentiation to EPC was confirmed by flow cytometry as 100% cells were CD71 + . In microarray studies, a total of 2996 genes were highly expressed in FL, 2673 genes in CB, 2580 in mPB, 1465 in PB and 1259 in BM derived EPC. 661 of these genes were common for all type of cells. The high level of expression, beside globin genes, was observed for the following genes: transferrin receptor, proteoglycans, ALAS2, Charcot-Leyden crystal protein, nucleophosmin, eosinophil peroxidase, myeloperoxidase and ribonucleases. Most of the analyzed genes demonstrated down-regulation during ontogenesis (elastase 2, glutathione peroxidase 1, SERPINB1, nudix, mitochondrial proteins, ribosomal proteins, enthoprotin, serine proteinase inhibitor), but some showed up-regulation (hexokinase, superoxide dismutase 2, spectrin). Besides developmental changes of globin gene expression during ontogenesis, we also analyzed changes in their expression during erythropoiesis in these different tissues by quantitative PCR. Beta-globin gene expression reached the maximum levels in cells of adult blood origin: BM (176 fmol/\u03bcg) and PB (110 fmol/\u03bcg). Gamma-globin gene expression, of FL origin, had steady levels during erythroid differentiation (20 fmol/\u03bcg), whereas cord blood derived EPC demonstrated consistent up-regulation (60 fmol/\u03bcg) in contrast to cells originated from adult blood (3\u201315 fmol/\u03bcg at day 14th). G protein related genes and histone deacetylases were elevated in CB derived EPC, concomitant with increased gamma-globin gene expression. We also analyzed the gamma-globin induction by hydroxyurea, a well known inducer, and established which G protein-coupled receptors involved pathways are activated in PB derived EPC: dopamine receptors D1, D2 and D5, beta 2 adrenergic receptor, human DP prostanoid receptor and prostaglandin E receptor 1, as well as genes activated by cAMP/PKA, PI-3 kinase, MAP and NO/cGMP pathways. This study establishes concomitant changes in expression of globin genes and other known and/or previously unrecognized genes, which appear to be involved in erythropoiesis.",
