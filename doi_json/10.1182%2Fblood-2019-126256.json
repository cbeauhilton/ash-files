    "abstract_text": "The tyrosine protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP4A3 has been extensively reported to play a causative role in numerous cancers, including several types of acute leukemia. We found PTP4A3 to be highly expressed in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia samples, and show that PTP4A3 accelerates T-ALL onset and increases the invasive ability of T-ALL cells in a zebrafish model, and is required for T-ALL engraftment and progression in mouse xenograft. Our in vitro studies showed that PTP43A3 enhances T-ALL migration, in part via modulation of SRC signaling. However, whether SRC is a direct substrate of PTP4A3, and whether the phosphatase activity of PTP4A3 actually plays a role in T-ALL or other types of leukemia progression is unknown and remains a major question in the field. We used a BioID-based proximity labeling approach combined with PTP4A3 substrate trapping mutant pull down assay to capture the PTP4A3 substrates candidates. BioID, a biotin ligase, was fused to PTP4A3 to generate a Biotin-PTP4A3 (BP) fusion protein. The overexpression of BP in T-ALL cell lines led to biotin modification of 288 PTP4A3 proximal proteins, including the potential direct PTP4A3 substrates. PANTHER pathway analysis showed that PTP4A3 interacting proteins are largely clustered in the T-cell activation, PDGF signaling, and angiogenesis. We are in process of validating potential substrates using immunoprecipitation and phosphoenrichement assays. Finally, we are using a novel zebrafish Myc+PTP4A3 induced T-ALL model to assess the function of PTP4A3 in leukemia progression. We have created several PTP4A3 protein mutants, including a phosphatase-dead mutant, a mutant unable to bind magnesium transporter, and a prenylation deficient mutant, and are in process of assessing the effects of these mutants in T-ALL onset and progression in our in vivo model. In total, these studies will allow us to better understand function of PTP4A3 in T-ALL progression, and may provide a strong rationale for the development of PTP4A3 inhibitors for use in leukemia.
