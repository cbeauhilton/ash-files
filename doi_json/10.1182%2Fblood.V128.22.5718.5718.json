    "abstract_text": "Mutated nucleophosmin (NPM1) was identified as a promising leukemia-specific antigen for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). NPM1 is a multifunctional nucleocytoplasmic shuttling phosphoprotein. In AML patients with normal cytogenetics NPM1 mutations are the most frequent molecular genetic abnormalities, accounting for up to 60% of the patients. The peptide (AIQDLCLAV) derived from the mutated NPM1 (NPM1mut) has been described to elicit a CTL response restricted to HLA-A*02:01. We observed that NPM1mut multimer+ T cells were very rare in peripheral blood. The limitation of the multimer technology is the absence of a positive control; nevertheless it is an attractive tool to generate antigen positive T cell clones. The goal was to compare strategies for the generation of NPM1mut multimer+ T cell clones systematically. For this purpose we analyzed blood samples from two patients with AML after transplantation and six different healthy donors. We explored different strategies to isolate HLA-A*02:01 restricted NPM1mut multimer+ T single cells. The first strategy was to isolate multimer+ T cells directly from the blood without any supplements by single cell sorting. The second strategy was to sort multimer+ T cells which were previously CD8+ enriched supplementing the media either with or without IL-21. Published by Yongqing et al. IL-21 enhances the generation of human antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. A further strategy was to previously enrich CD14+ cells for the generation of autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). The co-cultivation of MoDCs loaded with the NPM1mut peptide and CD8+ cells were performed either with or without IL-21, as well. We expanded the last strategy by a second round of NPM1mut-specific stimulation. So far it was not possible to generate NPM1mut-specific T cell clones based on the advanced strategies and consistently there is no data published on NPM1mut multimer+ T cell clones. This fact raises the question why NPM1mut specific clones display such low frequencies. We want to point out that although we varied the strategies and we used eight different donors the isolation of NPM1mut-specific T cells restricted to HLA-A*02:01 apparently is challenging. Greater efforts, e.g. a larger number of donors or the use of immunological checkpoint inhibitors during cell culture are needed. Disclosures Thiede: AgenDix: Employment, Other: Ownership.
