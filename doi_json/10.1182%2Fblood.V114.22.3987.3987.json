There is increasing evidence that MPs are involved in thrombosis, but whether or not they are an independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is not established. Aim of the study To investigate the association between high plasma levels of MPs and risk of VTE Patients and Methods In a case-control study, 186 patients with a first episode of VTE (deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism) and 418 healthy controls were included. MPs were analyzed by flow cytometry with a gate defined by a 1 \u03bcm beads and using APC-Annexin V together with FITC anti-CD41 or FITC anti-CD142 antibodies in order to identify platelet MPs (MP-Plts) and MPs exposing tissue factor (MP-TF), respectively. MPs levels were expressed as number/\u03bcL. Results Patients had significantly higher median plasma levels of both MPs-Plts and MPs-TF than controls [1942 vs 1519 (p95 th percentile of the control group (3633/\u03bcL for MPs-Plts and 1113/\u03bcL for MPs-TF) than in those with MPs levels \u226495 th percentile [for MPs-Plts: OR=2.59 (95%CI 1.23 \u2013 5.45); for MPs-TF: OR=2.38 (1.15 \u2013 4.92)]. The risk increased in a dose-dependent manner for both MPs-Plts and MPs-TF, particularly above the 75 th percentile of the distribution in controls. The exclusion of patients whose MPs levels were measured within 6 months from VTE (in order to avoid the possible effect of the acute phase on MPs measurements), did not change the results [adjusted OR: 2.63 (1.18 \u2013 5.89) for MPs-Plts and 2.36 (1.10 \u2013 5.19) for MPs-TF]. The Table shows the relative risks of VTE associated with the presence or absence of high MPs levels and thrombophilia. Individuals with MPs >95 th percentile or thrombophilia alone had a 2 to 3-fold increased risk of VTE, whereas those with both MPs-Plts >95 th percentile and thrombophilia had a 9-fold increased risk of VTE. This synergistic effect was confirmed also for MPs-TF and remained after the exclusion of patients whose blood sample was collected within 6 months from VTE [OR 7.72 (1.68-35.4) for MP-Plts and 8.14 (2.08-31.8) for MP-TF]. Conclusions Plasma levels of MPs are significantly higher in patients with VTE than in healthy controls. MPs levels >95 th percentile are associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of VTE. There is a synergistic interaction between high levels of MPs and thrombophilia on VTE risk.
