    "abstract_text": "The Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway is an important and conserved pathway in lymphocytes which is activated by extracellular stimuli such as cytokines and growth factors. Aberrant activation of the JAK-STAT pathway is a hallmark of a variety of lymphomas which leads to increased proliferation/survival as well as immune evasion. Regarding the latter, it has been previously described that activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway can alter the secretome of lymphoma cells and the composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Specifically, our group reported PTPN1 loss-of-function as well as IL4R gain-of-function (p.I242N) mutations up-regulate the expression of the immune regulatory chemokine CCL17 through a STATs-dependent mechanism in primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL). Here, we assembled a cohort of 340 diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients uniformly treated with R-CHOP to investigate JAK-STAT signaling mutations (targeted gene sequencing), copy number alteration (SNP arrays), gene expression (RNAseq) and TME composition (Cibersort, IHC). We confirmed the presence of mutations in SOCS1 , STAT6 and 9p24 amplification with a frequency of 13.8%, 2.5%, 11.4%, respectively. Interestingly, we also identified the presence of somatic IL4R mutations in DLBCL, including the hotspot p.I242N mutation previously reported in PMBCL. Similarly to what was reported for other alterations in the JAK-STAT pathway, IL4R mutations were significantly enriched in GCB-DLBCL as compared to the ABC subtype, unclassified or double hit lymphomas with DLBCL morphology (p=0.045). Within the GCB group, patients carrying mutations in IL4R showed inferior disease-specific survival (p=0.029) and time to progression (p=0.023) after R-CHOP therapy. Mutational analysis revealed IL4R mutation being significantly concurrent together with mutations in ACTB , KLML6 , MYC , STAT6 , NLRC5 , TNFAIP3 and mutually exclusive with EZH2 mutations (p<0.05). However, among those gene mutations, only mutations in IL4R risk-stratified patients with GCB DLBCL and showed inferior patient outcomes. Moreover, mutations in the extracellular and transmembrane domains of IL4R resulted in gain-of-function leading to constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway in vitro . Gene expression analysis of primary patient samples carrying IL4R mutations displayed increased CCL17 expression (p=0.027), which positively correlated with the level of the T-regulatory marker FOXP3 by IHC (p=0.005). In addition, in silico TME composition analysis revealed a role of IL4R mutations in inducing changes in macrophage polarization. Specifically, we observed an enrichment of an M2-like macrophage phenotype in primary patient specimens carrying IL4R mutations (p=0.01) and a high M2/M1 ratio was significantly associated with inferior patient outcomes (time to progression, log rank p=0.027). In summary, our data suggest a common mechanism between PMBCL and DLBCL where aberrant JAK-STAT activation mediated by mutations in IL4R plays a significant role in altering chemokine expression profiles and TME changes.
