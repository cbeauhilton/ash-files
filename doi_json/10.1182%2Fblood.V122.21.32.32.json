    "abstract_text": "Background Generation of \u03b1-thrombin (FIIa) in response to vascular injury is a key host defense mechanism influencing thrombus formation and inflammation. Blood platelets express glycoprotein (GP) Ib\u03b1 as the most abundant FIIa membrane binding site, as well as different protease activated receptors (PARs) with an effector role in platelet activation after proteolytic cleavage. The functional role of GPIb\u03b1, which is not a substrate for FIIa, relative to that of different PARs remains unclear. Aims Goal of these studies was to define with mechanistic understanding whether and how binding to GPIb\u03b1 can modulate FIIa prothrombotic functions in vivo and ex vivo. Methods Endogenous mouse platelet GPIb\u03b1 was replaced by the human (hu) counterpart with wild type (WT) sequence; or containing the single substitution of Asp277 (mutated to Asn), which interacts selectively with a site involving FIIa exosite 2; or with the combined substitution of post-translationally sulfated Tyr276, Tyr278 and Tyr279 (each mutated to Phe), which interact with FIIa residues in proximity of exosite 1 as well as exosite 2. These mice were evaluated in intravital models of arterial thrombosis. Moreover, their platelets were tested ex vivo for the response to FIIa-induced activation measuring changes in intracytoplasmic Ca 2+ levels; and for effects on fibrinogen clotting and fibrin formation. Comparative ex vivo experiments were conducted with human and huGPIb\u03b1-WT mouse platelets in which FIIa binding was similarly blocked by the anti-human GPIb\u03b1 monoclonal antibody, LJ-Ib10. Ex vivo FIIa effects on platelet activation/aggregation and fibrin clot formation were also evaluated concurrently in a model of thrombus formation in blood perfused over a thrombogenic surface under controlled flow conditions. Results Genetically modified mouse platelets expressed \u22489000 WT or mutant huGPIb\u03b1 molecules; platelets with huGPIb\u03b1-WT bound \u224810,000 FIIa molecules with 1:1 stoichiometry and K D of \u22483 nM. FIIa binding to mutant huGPIb\u03b1 was essentially abolished. Mice with defective FIIa binding to GPIb\u03b1 exhibited a pronounced prothrombotic phenotype, with a shorter time to carotid artery occlusion following ferric chloride injury (median 550.5 seconds in 18 mutant huGPIb\u03b1, vs. 1980 seconds in 19 huGPIb\u03b1-WT mice; P<0.01). Accordingly, the platelet-rich plasma (PRP) of mutant huGPIb\u03b1 mice exhibited a significantly shorter clotting time in the presence of 4 nM FIIa and significantly enhanced intracytoplasmic Ca 2+ transients and platelet aggregation following stimulation by 0.5 nM FIIa. Human platelets, similar to mouse platelets, bound FIIa with a 1:1 stoichiometry relative to GPIb\u03b1 and K D of \u22483 nM. Remarkably, blocking FIIa binding to GPIb\u03b1 with antibody LJ-Ib10 essentially abolished activation by 1 nM FIIa in human platelets, in which FIIa effects are mediated predominantly by PAR1; this was in contrast to the enhanced activation seen under the same conditions in hu GPIb\u03b1-WT mouse platelets, in which FIIa acts through PAR3 and PAR4. Accordingly, the volume of platelet aggregates and fibrin formed in huGPIb\u03b1-WT mouse blood perfused over a thrombogenic surface was enhanced by blocking FIIa binding to platelets; in contrast, the volume of platelet aggregates, but not that of fibrin clots, was decreased under the same conditions in human blood. Antibody LJ-Ib10 shortened the clotting time of both huGPIb\u03b1-WT mouse and human PRP; however, in the absence of GPIb\u03b1-bound FIIa, fibrin associated with platelet aggregates had a less ordered fibrillar structure. Conclusions Our findings identify GPIb\u03b1 as a relevant FIIa activity modulator. Through distinct mechanisms influenced by the expression of specific PAR subtypes, GPIb\u03b1 can modulate FIIa function in hemostasis and thrombosis both enhancing and controlling prothrombotic responses and, thus, size and structure of platelet/fibrin thrombi. The effect of GPIb\u03b1 on PAR4-mediated platelet activation, as well as fibrinogen clotting, can be explained by competition for FIIa exosites required for substrate binding, but the mechanism supporting the distinct GPIb\u03b1-PAR1 functional association remains to be elucidated.
