Methods: The BM samples were characterized by the FCSS from 56 consecutive, newly diagnosed MDS patients who were morphologically classified as RA (n=3), MDS-U (n=1), RCMD/RCMD-RS (n=32), RAEB-1 (n=12) and RAEB-2 (n=8) from January 2005 to December 2009. Three-color FCM was performed on total nonerythroid BM cells with a standardized panel of monoclonal antibodies ( Table 1 ). The final FCSS was based on the independent analysis of data by 2 investigators (S.C.C., T.F.W.,) who were blinded to MDS/non-MDS category and clinical outcomes. The FCSS were categorized as normal/mild (0 or 1 point), moderate (2 or 3 points), or severe (4 or more points). The results of FCSS were compared with findings in 27 non-MDS cytopenic patients as the control, including diagnosis of aplastic anemia (n=7), iron deficiency anemia (n=3), folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency anemia (n=6) and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (n=11). FCSS scores were retrospectively compared with marrow blast counts, cytogenetics, hematologic parameters, IPSS and WHO categorization to assess the utility in diagnosis and prognosis of MDS. Follow-up of patients continued until May 2010, with mortality observed in 30 (54%) patients. The patient characteristics are summarized in Table 2 . Nearly all MDS patients underwent supportive care rather than hypomethylation agents(n=3), chemotherapy(n=4) or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation(n=0). Results: The FCSS scores were significantly higher in patients with MDS than those in the non-MDS control (3 vs. 0, P < .0001). A flow score of 2 or more allowed for a specificity of 100% with 75% sensitivity in diagnosing MDS. The FCSS scores correlated directly with IPSS scores (n=40, R=.5327, P =.0004) and WHO classification (n= 56, R=.5163, P <.0001) but did not correlated with IPSS cytogenetic risk categories (n=40, P = .7738). The median survival were 6 months, 19 months and not reach for MDS patients with severe, moderate and mild FCSS scores, respectively (n=56, P = .0018)( Figure 1 ). The Multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazard model in a stepwise manner demonstrated the FCSS risk categories was an independent prognostic factor ( P =.0020) after adjusting for sex, age (above 70 year-old or not) and IPSS risk categories. Furthermore, among 32 patients classified as RCMD/RCMD-RS, the median survival were 2 months, 13 months and not reach for patients with severe, moderate and mild FCSS scores, respectively (n=32, P = .0045) ( Figure 2 ). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that quantifying aberrancies in myelomonocytic lineage by FCSS is very useful in MDS diagnosis. As shown in a bone marrow transplant study the FCSS also predicts outcome in conventionally treated patients and may give a more accurate prognosis especially among patients classified as RCMD subgroup.
