    "abstract_text": "Purpose: To study the efficacy of anti-CD19-CAR T-cell therapy and the changes of donor chimerism in CAR-T cells in vitro culture for patients who relapsed after allo-HSCT with a low level of donor chimerism. Methods: Two patients relapsed after allo-HSCT with a low level of donor chimerism (11.22% and 16.08%). Their autologous PBMCs were selected for anti-CD19-CAR T-cell therapy because their sibling or unrelated donor could not provide PBMC cells. The adverse events (AEs) were observed after CAR T-cell infusion. The cytokine release syndrome (CRS), the expansion of anti-CD19-CAR T-cells, the DNA level of anti-CD19-CAR gene and the changes of the donor chimerism were detected after CAR T-cell infusion. Then we selected other 7 acute leukemia patients relapsed after allo-HSCT with a low level of donor chimerism to detect the changes of donor chimerism in their T cells and anti-CD19-CAR T-cells in vitro culture. Results: Their notable AEs were grade 2 CRS. They had no aGVHD during anti-CD19-CAR T-cell therapy. They achieved CR 14 days after anti-CD19-CAR T-cell therapy with a restoration of complete donor chimerism (98.61% and 98.48%). To date, they had leukemia-free survival (LFS) and complete donor chimerism for 8 and 7 months. It was very interesting and fortunate that the CAR-T cells infused into the two patients were restorated to complete donor chimerism (99.2% and 99.4%). Then we found that complete donor chimerism were restored after 12 days culture in vitro in all the T cells and anti-CD19-CAR T-cells in the other 7 patients relapsed after allo-HSCT with a low level of donor chimerism. Conclusions: Anti-CD19-CAR T-cells derived from patients relapsed after allo-HSCT with a low level of donor chimerism were effective for this salvage therapy and could restorate to complete donor chimerism after 12 days culture in vitro.
