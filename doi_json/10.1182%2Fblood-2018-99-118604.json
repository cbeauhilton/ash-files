    "abstract_text": "The FDA-approval of potent targeted therapies has led to great changes in the therapeutic landscape of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). As a key example, venetoclax, a first-in-class BCL-2 inhibitor, leads to response in about 80% of patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL. Disease progression on venetoclax, however, has been increasingly observed, and better biologic understanding of resistance mechanisms to this agent is needed. To systematically discover the potential mechanisms of resistance to venetoclax, we performed both genome-scale loss- (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) genetic modifier screens in the BCL-2-driven OCI-Ly1 lymphoma cell line using CRISPR-Cas9 sgRNA and ORF libraries, respectively. Significant hits from both screens included the BCL-2 family: the LOF screen with pro-apoptotic genes ( PMAIP1 , BAX , BAK1 , BCL-2L11 ) and the GOF screen with anti-apoptotic genes ( BCL2L1 , BCL2L2 , BCL2 , MCL1 ). In addition, the LOF screen uncovered genes in pathways relevant to lymphoid biology (i.e, NFKBIA ) and lymphoid transcription factors and modulators ( IKZF5 , ID3 , EP300 , NFIA ). The GOF screen also uncovered components of the energy-stress sensor PKA/AMPK signaling pathways ( ADIPOQ , PRKAR2B , PRKAA2 ) and regulators of mitochondrial metabolism. In parallel, we performed an integrated transcriptome, whole proteome and functional characterization of an OCI-Ly1 cell line rendered resistant to venetoclax (OCI-Ly1-R) from the parental cell line (OCI-Ly1-S). RNA-seq and spectrometry-based proteomics revealed coordinated dysregulation of transcripts and proteins in the resistant line originating from genes critical to cellular metabolism, cell cycle, B-cell biology and autophagy. Of the transcripts and proteins significantly associated with the resistant cell line, only MCL-1 overlapped with the gene hits from the genome-scale screens. Treatment of the OCI-Ly-R cells with the MCL-1 inhibitor S63845 synergized with venetoclax. Given the dysregulation of proteins critical to metabolism in both the GOF screen and in OCI-Ly1-R cells, we also evaluated the role of metabolic reprogramming in venetoclax resistance. We first assessed mitochondrial respiration by measuring the oxygen consumption rate. Compared to OCI-Ly-S cells, OCI-Ly1-R cells demonstrated markedly higher respiration levels, suggesting a state of higher oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). More directly, we measured oxygen consumption following venetoclax exposure. Consistent with impairment of OXPHOS by venetoclax, we observed both an immediate decrease in oxygen consumption and an immediate burst of glycolysis following venetoclax in the OCI-Ly1-S cells, but not in the OCI-Ly1-R cells. In line with these findings, the AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin and mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) inhibitors synergized with venetoclax in OCI-Ly1-S cells. Transcriptome related to ID3 (identified as one of the LOF screen targets) was characterized in isogenic ID3-knockout OCI-Ly1 lines. It revealed PRKAR2B overexpression as a key effect, suggesting a role for ID3, and perhaps of other lymphoid transcription factors in regulating metabolic reprogramming associated with resistance. Indeed, exposure of ID3 knockout lines to mETC inhibitors overcame resistance to venetoclax. To determine if there is a genetic basis for the drug resistance seen in OCI-Ly1-R cells, we compared whole-exome sequencing (WES) results of DNA isolated from the OCI-Ly1-R and OCI-Ly1-S cell lines. A clear region was amplified on chromosome 1q23, which includes MCL1 and PRKAB2 (the regulatory subunit of AMPK). Similarly, a WES-based analysis of paired CLL DNA samples isolated from 6 R/R CLL patients just prior to venetoclax initiation and at time of progression on venetoclax was performed. We did not identify any non-silent somatic single nucleotide in BCL2 or its family members at baseline or at progression, despite marked clonal shifts in all patients. We confirmed the presence of the amp (1q23) as acquired at relapse after venetoclax in 3 out of 6 patients. Our study reveals that venetoclax resistance implicates changes not only for outer mitochondrial membrane (MCL-1 expression) but also for inner membrane (oxydative metabolism). Such mitochondrial reprogramming represents a new vulnerability that can potentially be exploited through combinatorial therapy with metabolic modulators to overcome resistance.
