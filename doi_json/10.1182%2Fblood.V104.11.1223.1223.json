    "abstract_text": "Ferritin heavy chain (FH), an embryonically-expressed protein in the erythroid lineage, localizes to the nucleus and represses the human adult \u03b2-globin promoter in transient expression assays ( Broyles et al., PNAS  98 : 9145 , 2001 ). Recently, we have performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays with cross-linked chromatin of K562 cells in which the \u03b2-globin gene is repressed, using anti-FH polyclonal antisera. These results strongly indicate that FH occupies the repression site (a CAGTGC motif) in vivo. Binding to this -150 site has been previously demonstrated to be required for \u03b2-promoter repression in co-transfections. EMSA assays (competitive gel shifts) have revealed that the mouse \u03b2 Major -globin promoter has an analogous CAGTGN motif at -160 bp from the cap site that competes specifically with the human CAGTGC site for FH binding. The mouse \u03b2 Minor -globin promoter lacks the -150/-160 CAGTGN motif and, therefore, the FH binding site. Thus, a human FH transgenic mouse, in which the FH gene is driven by a truncated \u03b2-promoter lacking the CAGTGN motif, should express human FH in definitive erythroid cells where the FH would be predicted to repress \u03b2 Major -globin but not \u03b2 Minor -globin. Such a mouse would be predicted to survive but be born with a mild \u03b2-thalassemia due to the decreased \u03b2 Major /\u03b2 Minor ratio in its definitive erythroid cells. Preliminary results from the litters of F1 generation FH-tg mice indicate that such is indeed the case, i.e., that human FH functions as a \u03b2 Major -globin repressor in vivo."
