    "abstract_text": "Introduction & Objective Adoptive T cell therapy with tumor-specific CD8 + T cells is a promising treatment option for a variety of malignant diseases. However, it is unclear which subset of CD8 + T cells characterized by distinct functions is most suitable for achieving effective and durable anti tumor responses. So far CD8 + T cells have been considered to act predominantly as cytotoxic effector cells in cellular anti-tumor immunity. In this respect cytolytic molecules such as perforin and granzymes and apoptosis-inducing receptors of the tumor necrosis family such as FasL, TNF\u03b1 and TRAIL have been regarded as major CD8 + T cell effector mechanisms. Methods & Results We here demonstrate in an experimental tumor model that CD40L, the key molecule for \u201cimmunological help\u201d, is expressed by up to 50% of tumor-specific CD8 + T cells in B6 mice challenged with SV40 T antigen + cancer cells. To study the influence of CD40L on anti-tumor CD8 + T cell immunity in vivo we challenged Rag1 -/- mice with cancer cells and transferred wt or CD40L -/- CD8 + T cells. Transfer of wt CD8 + T cells prevented the establishment of a solid tumor, whereas injection of CD40L -/- CD8 + T cells alone or in addition with wt CD4 + T cells resulted in a non-controlled tumor development similar to non-treated tumors. The requirement of CD40L on CD8 + T cells for tumor rejection was further confirmed by injecting cancer cells in mice that lack CD40L expression only on mature CD8 + T cells. CD40L flox x E8I cre mice were more susceptible to tumor formation than wt mice. Furthermore we demonstrated that CD8 + T-cell derived CD40L had to interact with CD40 on cancer cells, an eminent signal to induce apoptosis in various cancer cell types. Conclusion Our results reveal a crucial functional relevance of CD40L expressed by CD8 + T cells in anti-tumor immunity. Various cancer cell types express CD40 and its engagement induces pro-apoptotic or growth-inhibitory signals in a variety of cancer cells. Therefore CD40 agonists are recognized as promising agents for therapeutic interventions. We here introduce CD40L + CD8 + memory T cells as a new major physiological source of CD40L, essential for rejection of tumors. Our data reveal that the presence or absence of CD40L + CD8 + T cells represents a crucial element in control of CD40 expressing cancers disclosing novel treatment approaches in adoptive T-cell therapies novel treatment approaches.
