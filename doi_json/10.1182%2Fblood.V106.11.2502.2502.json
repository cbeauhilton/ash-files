    "abstract_text": "Multiple Myeloma (MM) cells grow into the bone marrow (BM) mainly through the interactions with the microenvironment. The marked induction of angiogenesis by myeloma cells suggests that this process has a pivotal role in the progression of MM. However the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of angiogenesis remain unresolved. The new candidate tumor suppressor gene \u201cinhibitor of growth family member 4\u201d (p29ING4) has been recently implicated in solid tumors as a repressor of angiogenesis and tumor growth through the association with p65 subunit of NF-kB and the suppression of angiogenic related gene as IL-8 (Garkavtsev I et al., Nature 2004). In this study first we have evaluated the mRNA expression of p29ING4 in human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs): U266, RPMI-8226, XG-1, XG-6, OPM-2 and JJN3, in EBV+ lines HS-SULTAN and ARH-77 and in purified CD138+ plasmacells (purity >90%) obtained from either 32 MM patients or 6 patients with MGUS by both qualitative RT-PCR and quantitative real time PCR. Healthy CD20+ BM B lymphocytes and/or CD138+ plasmacells obtained from reactive tonsils have been used as controls. p29ING4 has been checked at protein level by western blot on nuclear extracts using a polyclonal anti-p29ING4 Ab. In addition, p29ING4 mRNA levels have been compared with IL-8, VEGF, Ang-1 mRNA levels and correlated with BM angiogenesis in MM patients. The presence of p29ING4 transcript was observed in HMCLs even if p29ING4 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in all HMCLs tested as compared to controls with a median \u0394Ct p29ING4 (Ct p29ING4-Ct Abl ): 3.2 vs. 0.45 (p 25 pg/ml) have a significantly lower p29ING4 mRNA levels (median \u0394Ct p29ING4:4.71 vs. 1.9; p=0.04). Finally we found that MM patients with high microvalscular density (MVD) and number of vessels X field have significant lower p29ING4 mRNA levels as compared to those with low MVD (median \u0394Ct p29ING4:4,8 vs. 2; p=0.04). Our data indicate that the tumor suppressor p29ING4 is down-regulated in myeloma cells and regulate their pro-angiogenic properties.",
