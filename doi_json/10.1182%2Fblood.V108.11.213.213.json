    "abstract_text": "It is postulated that integrins undergo structural rearrangement from the low affinity bent conformer to the high affinity extended conformer upon activation. In inside-out signaling, the binding of talin to \u03b2 cytoplasmic tail has been shown to activate integrin by disrupting the endogenous \u03b1/\u03b2 cytoplasmic tail interaction that constrains integrin in low affinity state. How this intracellular event triggers structural rearrangement in the extracellular part of the integrin has not been elucidated. In integrin bent conformer, \u03b2-tail not only makes interface with \u03b2-head, but also makes large interface with \u03b1-tail. We previously reported that the membrane-proximal \u03b1-tail/\u03b2-tail interface interaction regulates integrin activation, and that stabilization of this interface completely blocks the propagation of inside-out signaling. From these results, we hypothesized that dissociation of the \u03b1-tail/\u03b2-tail following the dissociation of the \u03b1/\u03b2 cytoplasmic tails triggers disruption of the \u03b2-head/\u03b2-tail interaction that constrains integrin in the bent state, thus activates integrin in inside-out signaling. Here we report that dissociation of the extracellular \u03b1-tail/\u03b2-tail actually activates \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin. To induce dissociation of the tails, we introduced N-linked glycosylation site (N-X-T/S) in \u03b1IIb amino acid residue Met-660 (M660NRT) which is located at the calf-1/EGF-3 interface that compose part of the \u03b1-tail/\u03b2-tail interface. When expressed in CHO cells, the mutant \u03b1IIb\u03b23 constitutively bound fibrinogen. Introduction of any sequences other than N-X-T/S in this site failed to activate \u03b1IIb\u03b23, suggesting this activation depends on the binding of a bulky N-glycan to the site. This activation was completely abolished when the \u03b2-head/\u03b2-tail interface was stabilized. Notably, stabilization of the membrane-proximal calf-2/EGF4-\u03b2TD interface with a disulfide bridge significantly inhibited activation induced by calf-1/EGF-3 dissociation, while it did not have any effect on fully extended \u03b1IIb\u03b23. These results suggest that disruption of the membrane-proximal \u03b1-tail/\u03b2-tail interface rather than the dissociation of the membrane-distal calf-1/EGF-3 interface is critical for initiating the structural rearrangement. Next, we examined whether disruption of the \u03b2-head/\u03b2-tail interface activates \u03b1IIb\u03b23 by introducing N-linked glycosylation site in \u03b23 amino acid residue Gly-382 or in Thr-564 that are located at the \u03b2-head/\u03b2-tail interface. The resulting G382NLT and T564N mutants constitutively bound fibrinogen. This activation was completely abolished when \u03b1IIb\u03b23 was constrained in the bent conformer. Different from the M660NRT, this activation was not inhibited by stabilizing the calf-2/EGF4-\u03b2TD interface. In summary, these results suggest, 1) that disruption of the \u03b2-head/\u03b2-tail interface is required for the \u03b1-tail/\u03b2-tail dissociation to activate \u03b1IIb\u03b23, 2) that \u03b1IIb\u03b23 has to be able to extend for the disruption of the \u03b2-head/\u03b2-tail interface to activate \u03b1IIb\u03b23, 3) dissociation of the \u03b1-tail/\u03b2-tail is not required for activation, once \u03b2-head/\u03b2-tail interface is disrupted or \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is fully extended. Taken together, these results are consistent with our hypothesis and indicate that the \u03b1-tail/\u03b2-tail interface interaction is the key regulator of integrin activation in inside-out signaling.",
