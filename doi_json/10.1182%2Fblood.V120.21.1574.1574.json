    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1574 Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with a highly variable natural history ranging from an indolent disease to a rapidly progressive one such as its transformation to aggressive NHL. We have used the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) that uses patient- or tumor-specific characteristics for the risk-stratification of patients with FL at the time of diagnosis. The tumor microenvironment, including variable monocyte-derived cell infiltration, has recently shown to play an important role in the clinical course of FL patients. Wilcox et al. showed that an elevated absolute monocyte count (AMC) is associated with inferior overall survival of FL patients receiving varying treatment strategies (Wilcox RA, et al. Leuk Lymphoma 2012). We retrospectively evaluated the prognostic changes in AMC at diagnosis in FL patients treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) therapy alone. This study included 157 consecutive FL patients treated with the R-CHOP therapy at 1 of the 7 participating hospitals between 2001 and 2009. Since 2001, the Yokohama City University Hematology Group in Japan uniformly and curatively treated patients with FL, except for those with stage 1 FL; the patients were treated with 6 cycles of standard R-CHOP therapy for 21 days. Patients who showed partial response (PR) after the initial 4 cycles were administered a total of 8 R-CHOP cycles, and those who did not show PR after the initial 4 cycles or patients in whom the disease progressed at any given time received salvage therapy. Patients who had bulky masses at diagnosis received involved field radiation following 6\u20148 cycles of R-CHOP therapy. Patients for whom the doses had to be reduced by more than 20% were excluded from the study. The study included 80 men and 77 women, with a median age of 63 years at diagnosis (range, 18\u201480 years). The FL of the 157 patients were classified as grade 1 (n = 65), grade 2 (n = 60), grade 3a (n = 20), and grade 3b (n = 12) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) scheme. The median AMC at diagnosis was 349 cells/\u03bcL (range, 10\u20141110 cells/\u03bcL). The median observation period for surviving patients was 45 months. The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) estimated for the entire cohort was at 71.3%. The differences in the PFS when patients were stratified according to their AMCs were not significant. The effect of the following variables on PFS were assessed: (1) AMC > 390 cells/\u03bcL; (2) age > 60 years; (3) hemoglobin level < 120 g/L; (4) elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase levels; (5) nodal areas > 4; and (6) advancement of clinical stage. In the univariate analysis, the presence of more than 4 nodal areas (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.65, 95% CI, 1.58\u20144.47, P < 0.001) and advanced clinical stage (HR = 2.75, 95% CI, 1.26\u20146.03, P = 0.01) were associated with inferior PFS. However, in the multivariate analysis, the association between the presence of more than 4 nodal areas and survival was found to be significant (HR = 2.33, 95% CI, 1.28\u20144.24, P = 0.006). Therefore, both univariate and multivariate analyses indicate that AMC was not a prognostic factor for PFS. There was no statistically significant correlation between AMC and FL patients' clinical outcome. AMC is not a prognostic factor in FL patients treated by R-CHOP.
