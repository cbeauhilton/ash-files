    "abstract_text": "Therapeutic options for patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory B-NHL and poor bone marrow reserve are limited. Denileukin diftitox (DD), a recombinant fusion protein, which when given at the standard dose, is not myelosuppressive and achieved a response rate of 25% in pts with relapsed/refractory B-NHL ( Dang JCO  22 : 4095 \u20134102, 2004 ). We conducted a phase II, open label, multi-site study to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of DD given weekly in pts with relapsed/refractory B-NHL who had diminished bone marrow reserve. This is the first study of DD in NHL to use a dosing regimen other than the standard 18 mcg/kg/day for 5 days repeated every 21 days. Pts were required to have failed to respond or have progressive disease (PD) after \u22652 prior treatment regimens, bi-dimensional disease of at least 4cm 2 , and mild to moderate cytopenia defined as one or more of the following: ANC \u22651000 but <1500, platelets \u226540,000 but <150,000, and WBC \u22652000 but <4000, or have relapsed after prior stem cell transplantation (SCT). Denileukin diftitox was administered at 18 mcg/kg/day \u00d73 days followed by 21 mcg/kg weekly. Evaluation of response was performed after 8 wks of treatment, and pts with stable disease or objective response were to receive another 8 weekly infusions. Twenty-two pts enrolled; the median age was 67 yrs (range 45\u201378), median number of previous treatments was 4 (range 2\u20139), 12 had prior SCT. There were 14 pts with diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL), 5 follicular lymphoma (FL), and 3 small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The median lesion size at entry was 21cm 2 (range 10\u2013598cm 2 ). Twenty of 22 pts discontinued therapy prematurely, 14 due to PD, 1 with SD, and 5 due to toxicity. The median number of weekly doses given was 4 (range 1\u201316). No objective responses have been observed to date and enrollment has been suspended. Fourteen pts are alive (10 DLCL, 3 FL, 1 SLL) ranging from 2\u201314 months from entry. Adverse events observed with weekly dosing were similar to those seen with the standard regimen; however, incidence of most common grade 3\u20134 toxicities was less, with fatigue 24%, transaminase elevation 18%, and hypoalbuminemia 12%. Although all pts had mild to moderate cytopenia at enrollment, only 2 pts (9%) experienced grade 3\u20134 neutropenia, none with neutropenic infection, and 1 pt had worsening of thrombocytopenia from grade 3 at study entry to grade 4. In conclusion, weekly dosing of DD is well tolerated, even in pts with diminished marrow reserve, but has not demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in this heavily pretreated B-NHL population with bulky disease. Follow-up will continue for survival analysis.",
