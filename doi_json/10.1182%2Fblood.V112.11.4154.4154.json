    "abstract_text": "Although the predominant finding in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an expansion of monoclonal B lymphocytes, a polyclonal expansion of T cells co-exists in CLL patients. Allogenic stem cell transplants for CLL suggest that a significant graft versus leukaemia effect mediated through recognition of minor MHC or leukaemia specific antigens can be achieved. Since it appears that the immune system and probably T cells recognise CLL cells, it is possible that one or more T cell defects might contribute to the initiation or maintenance of a clone of CLL lymphocytes. PD-1 is a coinhibitory molecule that is expressed on T cells in patients with chronic viral infections. It has been suggested that PD-1 expression might be a marker of cell exhaustion due to antigenic overstimulation. We examined the expression of PD-1 and its naturally occurring ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 on both B and T cells in patients with CLL and compared this with expression on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We found that PD-1 was expressed on over 10% of CD4 + T cells in 7 of 9 cases of CLL (mean 22\u00b116%) but not on CD4 + T cells in any of 9 normal donors (mean 0\u00b10%), p=0.0009. There was no difference in PD-1 expression on CD8 + or CD14 + PBMCs from CLL patients and normal donors (for CD8 + 24\u00b121% and 19\u00b116% for CLL and normals; for CD14 + 58\u00b116% and 71\u00b131% for CLL and normals). More than 10% of CD5 + /19 + CLL cells expressed PD-1 in 7 of 10 cases (mean 18\u00b118%) while more than 10% of normal B cells from 6 of 7 donors also expressed PD-1 (mean 49\u00b130%). We examined the expression of PD-1 on nai\u0308ve, central memory, effector memory and terminally differentiated subsets of CD4 + cells (CD62L + CD45RA + , CD62L + CD45RA \u2212 , CD62L \u2212 CD45RA \u2212 and CD62L \u2212 CD45RA + respectively) from CLL patients and normal donors. The expression of PD-1 was higher on CD4 + cells from CLL patients in all subsets. The effect was most prominent in the effector memory subset (mean 54\u00b14% for CLL patients versus 26\u00b117% for normal donors, p=0.02). We looked for expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on T cells, B cells, monocytes and NK cells from CLL patients and normal donors. PD-L1 was only expressed on monocytes (mean 30\u00b123%) and NK cells (mean 14\u00b119%) from CLL patients and on monocytes from normal donors (mean 35\u00b126%). There was no expression of PD-L2 on any cell type in either CLL patients or normal donors. We conclude that there is increased expression of the co-inhibitory molecule PD-1 on CD4 + T cells in patients with CLL. Ligation of PD-1 by PD-L1 expressed on monocytes or NK cells could inhibit immune responses to tumor and infectious antigens leading to persistence of clonally expanded cells and predisposition to opportunistic pathogens.",
