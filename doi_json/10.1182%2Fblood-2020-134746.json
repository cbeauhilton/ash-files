    "abstract_text": "Background: Blasts and leukemic stem cells of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as several other hematologic malignancies express CD123, potentially providing a target for novel therapies. Vibecotamab (XmAb14045, SQZ622) is a potent bispecific antibody targeting both CD123 and CD3 that stimulates targeted T cell-mediated killing of CD123-expressing cells, regardless of T cell antigen specificity. It is a full-length immunoglobulin molecule designed to be dosed intermittently. Methods: Patients with relapsed or refractory AML, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), blast phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, or blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm were eligible to enroll on this first-in-human, multicenter, open-label phase 1 dose-escalation study (XmAb14045-01) with standard 3+3 design. The primary objective was to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dose and schedule of vibecotamab. Secondary objectives included safety, preliminary antileukemic activity, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of vibecotamab. Treatment was administered weekly in 28-day cycles, using a weight-based dose with 3 escalating doses in the first week followed by escalating weekly doses. Therapy was continued for as long as tolerated and there was continuing evidence of therapeutic benefit in the opinion of the investigator. Treatment response was assessed by the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) criteria after Cycle 1 and after each odd-numbered cycle. CRS was graded using the CRS revised grading system (Lee et al., Blood, 2014). Results: At data cut-off, 104 patients with AML, 1 with B-cell ALL, and 1 with CML as their primary diagnosis have been treated at dosages from 0.003 to 12.0 \u00b5g/kg vibecotamab. Patients had a median age of 63 years and were heavily pretreated (median of 3 prior therapies [range 1-8], including 32 (30%) who had undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation). The recommended initial priming dose is 0.75 \u00b5g/kg; no MTD has been identified. CRS or its component symptoms was the most common treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). CRS occurred in 62 of 106 patients (85% grade 1-2, 15% grade \u22653), the majority on the first dose. Additional events consistent with CRS or infusion related reaction were seen in 24% of subjects (chills, fever, tachycardia, hypotension, etc.), and they were mostly mild or moderate severity. No myelosuppression requiring dose modification or evidence of tumor lysis syndrome was seen. Response of CR (2), CRi (3) or MLFS (2) was observed in 7/51 patients (ORR=14%) treated at higher dose levels (0.75 \u00b5g/kg). Stable Disease was observed in an additional 36 patients (71%). No CR, CRi, or morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) responses were observed at lower doses. Antileukemic activity occurred quickly; 6 out of 7 responders achieved at least a MLFS response after first cycle. A characterization of responders versus non-responders revealed responding patients harbor a lower burden of disease and specific T-cell subtypes. No association was found between response status and CD123 target expression on AML blasts. Conclusions: Vibecotamab demonstrated evidence of antileukemic activity in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated at the \u22650.75 \u00b5g/kg doses cohorts, with a 14% response rate. CRS was the most common toxicity but was generally manageable with premedications. The study is ongoing with further optimization of dose and schedule. Biomarker data suggest a population of AML patients that are more likely to respond. Additional information will be provided at the time of the meeting.
