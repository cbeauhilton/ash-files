    "abstract_text": "Introduction Generally, CD34+ cells are used for genetic modification in gene therapy trials. CD34+ cells consist of a heterogeneous cell population with mostly limited long-term repopulating capabilities, resulting in low long-term engraftment levels in particular in those diseases in which gene modified cells lack a proliferative advantage over non-modified cells. Therefore, modifications in gene transfer vectors and gene transfer strategies are required to improve long-term clinical benefit in gene therapy patients. One particular attractive approach to solve this problem is the improvement of HSC based gene transfer by specifically targeting cells with long-term engraftment capabilities. Material and Methods We constructed lentiviral gene transfer vectors (LV) specifically targeting CD133+ cells, a cell population with recognized long-term repopulating capabilities. Targeting is achieved by pseudotyping with engineered measles virus (MV) envelope proteins. The MV glycoprotein hemagglutinin, responsible for receptor recognition, is blinded for its native receptors and displays a single-chain antibody specific for CD133 (CD133-LV). These vectors were compared to VSV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors in in vitro and in vivo competitive repopulation assays using mobilized peripheral blood CD34+ cells. Results Superior transduction of isolated human hematopoietic stem cell populations (CD34+CD38- or CD34+CD133+ cells) compared to progenitor cell populations (CD34+CD38+ or CD34+CD133-) could be shown using the newly developed CD133-LV. Transduction of total CD34+ cells with CD133-LV vectors resulted in stable gene expression and gene marked cells expanded in vitro, while the number of VSV-G-LV transduced CD34+ cells declined over time. Competitive repopulation experiments in NSG mice showed a significantly improved engraftment of CD133-LV transduced HSCs. At \u223c12 weeks post-transplantation gene marked hematopoiesis was dominated by the progeny of CD133-LV transduced cells in 42 out of 52 transplanted animals in the bone marrow and 39 out of 45 transplanted animals in the spleen, respectively. Consistent with this data we could show that stem cell content in the CD133-LV transduced population is about five times higher compared to the VSV-transduced population using a limiting dilution competitive repopulation assay (LDA-CRU). Experiments showing proof of principle for the application of this technology for the correction of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (XCGD) using patient derived CD34+ cells are currently ongoing. Discussion In conclusions this new strategy may be promising to achieve improved long-term engraftment in patients treated by gene therapy.
