    "abstract_text": "In contrast to that in children, the use of pegylated asparaginase in adult is very limited. We accept twenty-four newly diagnosed adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Use pegylated asparaginase in combination with vincristine,daunorubicin and prednisone for remission induction. Pegylated asparaginase (Heng Rui Pharmaceuticals) administered at a dose of 2000 IU/m 2 (maximum dose 3750 IU) intramuscular on day 10, 24. The aim was to observe complete response (CR) rate and side effect of the regimen. The overall CR rate was 91.67% (22/24), including 19 patients who were in CR after phase 1 of induction. 1 patient failed to achieve CR, and died of septicemia on day 24 of induction therapy. 1 Ph + ALL patient got CR after Imatinib added. Grade 3 or 4 hematological adverse effects were seen in 100% patients. Most non-hematological adverse effects were grade 1or 2, including vomiting and nausea (87.5%), infection (66.7%), liver disfunction (50%), diarrhea (12.5) and pancreatitis (4.1%). No allergic reactions were observed. The level of fibrinogen and AT III descended in all patients, including 7 patients fibrinogen less than 1.0g/L, 14 patients AT III less than 50%. But no patient developed evidence of bleeding or thrombosis. This regimen got a satisfactory CR rate in adult ALL and was safe with few grade 3/4 side effects. Pegylated asparaginase was well tolerated, no allergic reactions evidence of bleeding or thrombosis was observed. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
