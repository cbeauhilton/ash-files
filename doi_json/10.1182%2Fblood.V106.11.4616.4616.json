    "abstract_text": "The goal of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of an original DAF regimen: daunorubicine (DNR) 60 mg/m2/d iv, days 1\u20133; cytarabine (AraC) 200 mg/m2/d ci, d 1\u20137, and fludarabine 25 mg/m2 2h inf. iv d 1\u20135 versus previously studied DAC regimen * (DNR, AraC, Cladribine), and versus standard DA in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients below 60. Primary objective is complete remission (CR) rate after single course of induction and overall survival, secondary objectives - overall CR rate, toxicity, leukemia-free survival rate, assessment of lymphocyte subpopulations levels and survival in patients submitted to bone marrow allotransplantation (alloBMT) immediately after CR assessment. Patients achieving CR and did not submit to alloBMT received two courses of subsequent intensive consolidation: 1) HAM (HD AraC, mitoxantrone) 2) HD AraC. In case of partial remission (PR) after the first induction course the same regimen was repeated, Patients with no remission (NR) or PR/NR after 2 induction courses were withdrawn with the study. We are planning to enrol to the study 600 patients in 3 years. Between 09.2004 and 07.2005, 147 adult AML patients, aged 48 (19\u201360)y, sex: male 57, female 90, treated in 16 co-operating Polish Adult leukemia Group (PALG) centres were randomised to either DAF (n=44), DAC (n=49) or DA (n=54) arm. PML/RAR alfa positive - FAB M3 cases were excluded. Both study groups were well balanced in respect of age, sex, FAB subtype, and WBC. The final CR rate and CR rate after the first induction course equalled: for DAF 65% and 60%, for DAC 70% and 60%, and for DA 55% and 47%, respectively (p=NS). The median times to ANC recovery > 0.5 G/L, and PLT >50 G/L in each arms were similar (22\u201326 d.) (p=NS). All patients developed WHO grade IV thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis. The frequency and severity of infections, mucositis, vomiting, diarrhea, alopecia, polyneuropathy as well as of cardiac, liver or kidney failure were comparable in each treatment arms. Early death was noted in 6% (n=2) in DAF, in 9% (n=3) in DAC, and in 13% (n=5) in DA group, because of bacterial sepsis in every cases. In conclusion, this original study proves that the addition of fludarabine to the standard DNR+AraC regimen (DAF) comparing to DAC and DA regimen is a potent antileukemic treatment without increased toxicity.",
