    "abstract_text": "Chemokine Receptor 4 (CCR4) has been shown to be important for the homing of effector T-lymphocytes (T effs ) to cutaneous and possibly pulmonary sites of inflammation. CCR4 is also expressed on the surface of regulatory T-lymphocytes (T regs ), and previous work has suggested a critical role for CCR4 for their in-vivo suppressive ability. Since the skin and lung are important sites of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) morbidity, we set out to determine the contribution of CCR4 to both T eff and T reg function in a murine stem-cell transplant model. Methods: C57BL/6 (B6) mice served as bone marrow (BM) donors, and B6xDBA/2 F1 (B6D2) mice functioned as recipients. T effs and T regs were obtained from wild-type (WT) or CCR4 knockout (CCR4 \u2212/\u2212 ) B6 mice. For T eff studies, recipient animals were lethally irradiated and administered T-cell depleted (TCD) BM cells +/\u2212 splenic T effs from WT or CCR4 \u2212/\u2212 donors. For T reg studies, mice received TCD BM + WT T effs +/\u2212 naive or expanded T regs from WT or CCR4 \u2212/\u2212 donors. Results: Animals receiving WT or CCR4 \u2212/\u2212 T effs all developed severe GVHD with an 88% mortality rate. Using flow cytometry, we demonstrated that WT and CCR4 \u2212/\u2212 eGFP + T effs were able to accumulate in the skin and lungs of recipient animals at a similar frequency, suggesting a non-essential role for CCR4 in T eff homing to these sites. Attention was next directed towards the influence of CCR4 on T reg function in-vivo . Those animals receiving BM and T effs without T regs developed aggressive GVHD with 100% mortality. In contrast, when animals were administered BM and nai\u0308ve T regs from either WT or CCR4 \u2212/\u2212 donors two days prior to receiving T effs , all animals demonstrated 100% survival and only mild GVHD, suggesting a non-obligatory role for CCR4 for T reg function in-vivo . Since CCR4 is upregulated on T regs and T effs after activation, we next examined whether its absence would exert a greater effect on the ability of expanded T regs to protect against GVHD in-vivo compared to nai\u0308ve cells. Animals were irradiated and received TCD BM plus T effs +/\u2212 T regs from WT or CCR4 \u2212/\u2212 donors previously expanded in-vitro . Those animals receiving BM and T effs without T regs all developed severe GVHD with 100% mortality. Ex-vivo expanded WT T regs, 80% of which expressed L-selectin at low levels, provided only marginal GVHD protection with 12.5% survival when given concurrently with T effs at a 1:1 ratio. In contrast, expanded CCR4 \u2212/\u2212 T regs provided superior in-vivo GVHD protection, with 50% of mice surviving long term (see figure, p=.05 for WT versus CCR4 \u2212/\u2212 T reg groups). This enhanced protection in-vivo occurred despite an inferior ability of expanded CCR4 \u2212/\u2212 T regs to inhibit T-cell proliferation in an in-vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction compared to WT cells. Migration studies did not reveal a difference in the trafficking of expanded CCR4 \u2212/\u2212 T regs compared to WT cells except for a greater frequency of CCR4 \u2212/\u2212 T regs in the mesenteric lymph node on day +7. Conclusions: Our data suggest that nai\u0308ve CCR4 \u2212/\u2212 T regs are as efficient as WT cells in preventing GVHD, and that CCR4 is not required for the induction of GVHD by T effs . Paradoxically we show that expanded T regs function better to prevent GVHD in the absence of CCR4. Current work is underway to determine the mechanism for this finding.
