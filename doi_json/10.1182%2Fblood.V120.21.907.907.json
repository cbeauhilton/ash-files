    "abstract_text": "Abstract 907 Enhanced proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells are features common to emergency granulopoiesis and chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML). We have previously shown that C/EBP\u03b2, a transcription factor regulating emergency granulopoiesis, is upregulated in hematopoietic stem/progenitors in CP-CML and that C/EBP\u03b2 promotes BCR-ABL-mediated myeloid cell expansion (ASH annual meeting abstract. 2011; 118: 3747). However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the upregulation of C/EBP\u03b2 and the effects of C/EBP\u03b2 on the CML stem cells remained to be elucidated. Here we show that STAT5 is involved in the BCR-ABL-mediated C/EBP\u03b2 upregulation and that C/EBP\u03b2 accelerates the exhaustion of CML stem cells. In order to investigate the regulation of C/EBP\u03b2 in CP-CML, BCR-ABL gene was retrovirally introduced into EML cells, a mouse hematopoietic stem cell line, to make EML-BCR-ABL. The expression of C/EBP\u03b2 was upregulated at mRNA and protein level in EML-BCR-ABL when compared to EML cells transduced with a control vector. The upregulation of C/EBP\u03b2 was significantly repressed by adding imatinib mesylate, suggesting that the downstream signaling pathway of BCR-ABL is directly involved in the process. Neither a PI3K inhibitor nor a MEK inhibitor affected the levels of C/EBP\u03b2 in EML-BCR-ABL, but a STAT5 inhibitor reversed the upregulation of C/EBP\u03b2 in EML-BCR-ABL. Retroviral transduction of dominant-negative STAT5 mutant also impaired the upregulation of C/EBP\u03b2 in EML-BCR-ABL. Transduction of constitutively-active STAT5 mutant into parental EML cells significantly upregulated C/EBP\u03b2 expression. These results suggest that BCR-ABL upregulates C/EBP\u03b2 expression at least in part through activation of STAT5. To clarify the role of C/EBP\u03b2 in the regulation of CML stem cells, BCR-ABL-transduced bone marrow (BM) cells from C/EBP\u03b2 knockout (KO) mice or wild type (WT) mice were serially transplanted into irradiated recipient mice. In the first round of transplantation, all the recipient mice developed myeloproliferative status and the mice transplanted with BCR-ABL-transduced C/EBP\u03b2 KO BM cells survived longer than the mice transplanted with BCR-ABL-transduced WT BM cells. Interestingly, the frequency of c-kit + cells within BCR-ABL + cells was higher in the BM of the mice transplanted with BCR-ABL-transduced C/EBP\u03b2 KO cells than in the BM transplanted with BCR-ABL-transduced WT cells (Figure). When 2 \u00d7 10 6 BCR-ABL + BM cells from primary recipient mice were transplanted into sublethally irradiated secondary recipients, all the mice developed a myeloproliferative status. Transplantation of 1 \u00d7 10 6 BCR-ABL + BM cells from primary recipient mice, four out of the five recipient mice that transplanted with BCR-ABL-transduced C/EBP\u03b2 KO BM cells developed a myeloproliferative status and only one out of the four recipient mice that transplanted with BCR-ABL-transduced WT BM cells developed a myeloproliferative status. Transplantation of less than 0.5 \u00d7 10 6 BCR-ABL + BM cells engrafted none of the secondary recipient mice. The frequencies of leukemia-initiating cells in BM of primary recipient mice that transplanted with BCR-ABL-transduced WT cells or BCR-ABL-transduced C/EBP\u03b2 KO cells were 1 in 1,404,129 and 1 in 683,773, respectively. These findings suggest that C/EBP\u03b2 promotes exhaustion of CML stem cells. In conclusion, these results suggest that C/EBP\u03b2 is upregulated by BCR-ABL at least in part through STAT5 and that C/EBP\u03b2 has the ability to exhaust CML stem cells. We are currently investigating the molecular mechanisms which protect CML stem cells from C/EBP\u03b2-mediated exhaustion for complete eradication of CML stem cells in the future.
