    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Midostaurin is a first-generation, type I multi-targeted kinase inhibitor with inhibitory activity against FLT3 -ITD and -TKD mutations. Midostaurin is approved by FDA and EMA in combination with intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy for adult patients with AML exhibiting an activating FLT3 mutation; the EMA label also includes single-agent maintenance therapy following consolidation chemotherapy. We conducted a phase-II trial (AMLSG 16-10) to evaluate midostaurin with induction chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation (HCT) and a one-year midostaurin maintenance therapy in younger and older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD). METHODS: Patients 18 to 70 years of age with newly diagnosed FLT3 -ITD-positive AML were eligible. Primary and key secondary endpoints were event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS); results were compared to those of a historical control cohort of 415 patients with FLT3 -ITD AML. Statistical analysis was performed using a double-robust adjustment with propensity score weighting and covariate adjustment. Major differences in trial design compared to the pivotal CALGB 10603/RATIFY trial were: i) only AML with FLT3 -ITD were eligible; ii) AML with FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations (only) and core-binding factor AML were not eligible; iii) older patients 60-70 years of age were eligible; iv) all patients were assigned to allogeneic HCT; v) a one-year maintenance treatment with midostaurin was included also after allogeneic HCT; vi) a continuous dosing schedule of midostaurin was applied with the aim to achieve a better target inhibition. Results : The trial accrued 440 patients, including 312 younger (18-60 yrs) and 128 older (61-70 yrs) patients. Complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery rate, median EFS and OS of the 440 patients were 74.9%, 13.6 and 36.2 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis of EFS showed a highly significant hazard reduction for an event for patients treated within AMLSG 16-10 trial compared to the historical controls (HR 0.55; 95%-confidence interval [CI], 0.47, 0.65; P<0.001); this effect was significant in the younger (HR 0.59; 95%-CI, 0.49, 0.71; P<0.001) and the older patient cohort (HR 0.42; 95%-CI, 0.30, 0.60; P<0.001). Multivariate analysis also showed a highly significant beneficial effect on OS (HR 0.57; 95%-CI, 0.47, 0.68; P<0.001), again for both age subgroups. Allogeneic HCT in first CR/CRi was performed according to protocol in 199 of 440 (45%) patients (48% and 38% in younger and older patients, respectively), and an additional 60 patients received allogeneic HCT in firstline therapy (n=33 pts. in CR/CRi after salvage therapy and 27 pts. with active disease); the treatment effect of midostaurin remained significant in sensitivity analysis including allogeneic HCT (n=259) as a time-dependent covariate. Addition of midostaurin to chemotherapy was safe in younger and older patients. Conclusions : In comparison to a historical control cohort, the addition of midostaurin to intensive therapy led to a significant improvement in EFS and OS in both younger and older adult patients with AML and FLT3 -ITD.
