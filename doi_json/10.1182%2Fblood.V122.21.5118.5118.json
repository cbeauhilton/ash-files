    "abstract_text": "Background Post transplant\u00a0 lymphoproliferative \u00a0disorders (PTLD) , are\u00a0 a\u00a0\u00a0 complication of chronic\u00a0 immunosuppressive\u00a0 therapy\u00a0 in\u00a0 solid organ\u00a0 transplantation with a\u00a0 high mortality\u00a0 rate. Alternative treatments such as rapamycin have been explored. Methods A detailed retrospective analysis was performed according to data collected from thirteen patients with PTLD.\u00a0 At the time of PTLD diagnosis, immunosuppressive therapy was decreased and rapamycin administered. Overall survival and disease free survival of patients and graft survival were determined. Results Among 590 kidney transplant recipients, thirteen adult patients with PTLD were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 42.15 (range: 25-58) years at the time of PTLD diagnosis, and 9 patients were male. Histology was distributed in 9 diffuse large B cell, 1 Malt lymphoma, 1 Burkitt lymphoma, 2 Hodgkin-like PTLD. The response rate to rapamycin alone was 30.8%. The mean overall survival period is 27.4 months with 9 patients still living. In total, 10 patients (76.9%) achieved a complete remission, with functioning graft in 11 (84.6%) patients. Conclusions Despite to retrospective and limited number of patients, this study provides promising results regarding the effectiveness of stopping calcineurin inhibitors and switching to rapamycin for patients with PTLD.
