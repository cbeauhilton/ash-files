    "abstract_text": "Background Unmanipulated family haploidentical transplants are becoming increasingly used in patients lacking an HLA identical family donor, or a well matched unrelated donor. Aim of the study This is an updated analysis of our program of haploidentical bone marrow transplant (hBMT) , followed by post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (PT-CY) in 95 patients with hematoloigic malignancies receiving a myeloablative conditioning. Methods The conditioning regimen consisted of thiotepa, busulfan, fludarabine (TBF) (n=47) , thiotepa melphalan fludarabine (n=5) , or 9.9-12 Gy TBI + fludarabine (n=43). The patients\u2019 median age was 49 years (17-74); the disease status at the time of transplant, was first complete remission (CR1, n=29) , CR2 (n=23), or active disease (n=38,40%). The diagnosis was AML (35%), ALL (24%), MDS (12%) myeloproliferative disorders (12%), other malignancies (17%). The total nucleated cell dose infused was 3.37 (1.4-9.17). The median follow up for surviving patients is 440 days (90-930). Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted in PT-CY on day+3 and +5 , cyclosporine (from day 0) , and mycophenolate (from day +1). Results The cumulative incidence of neutrophil (PMN) engraftment was (90%) and all surviving patients on day +30 had full donor chimerism. The median day for neutrophil engraftment was day +17 (11-32). The cumulative incidence (CI) of grade II-III acute GvHD was 14%, and of moderate chronic GvHD 8%, severe cGvHD 9%. The CI of transplant related mortality (TRM) is respectively 7%, 17%, 26% for patients in CR1, CR2, or with active disease. The CI of relapse is respectively 17%, 30%, 37% for patients in CR1, CR2, or with active disease. The overall actuarial survival is respectively 75%, 44%, 32% for patients in CR1, CR2, or with active disease (p=0.002) (Fig.1). The most frequent cause of death was leukemia (26%) followed by infections (9%). Conclusions These data confirm our first report on 50 patients and support the use of myeloablative conditioning regimens, followed by h-BMT with PT-CY. The risk of acute and chronic GvHD seems relatively low , as well as the overall transplant related mortality. We have not seen the excess relapse rate reported when patients are given a non myeloablative regimen, and disease control has been satisfactorily both for patients in remission, as well as for patients with active disease at the time of transplants.
