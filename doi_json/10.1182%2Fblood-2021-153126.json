    "abstract_text": "Anemia of inflammation (AI) is the second most common anemia after iron deficiency anemia. The predominant regulators of AI are the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL6) and the hormone hepcidin (HAMP). IL6 is an inflammatory cytokine which also limits iron absorption by inducing HAMP, which promotes the degradation of the iron exporter ferroportin. We hypothesized that knocking down both HAMP and IL6 simultaneously will help us to understand if their mode of action in AI is uniquely limited to iron absorption and erythroid iron intake or if they also have independent roles. Henceforth, we generated IL6/HampKO (DKO) mice and, unexpectedly, observed that IL6KO mice showed the best recovery in bone marrow (BM) erythropoiesis (using flow cytometry analysis and looking at the absolute number of erythroid progenitors) after BA administration when compared to wild type ( WT ), HampKO and DKO mice. The best differences were observed at 14 days post BA administration. In contrast, the extramedullary erythropoiesis in the spleen was more pronounced in HampKO and DKO mice compared to WT and IL6KO animals, indicating that the mechanism impairing erythropoiesis in the BM did not affect erythroid progenitors in the spleen. These observations suggest that HAMP and IL6 proteins contribute independently to AI, with IL6 having some effect on the erythropoiesis in the BM independent from the IL6-HAMP axis leading to iron restriction. Furthermore, these observations raised the question why both HampKO and DKO mice showed reduced BM erythropoiesis compared to IL6 KO animals. We investigated inflammatory cytokines and altered iron parameters as potential mediators of impaired erythropoiesis. We compared several inflammatory cytokines, including IL6, TNFa and INFg following BA administration: cytokine levels were elevated 6 hrs, reduced 48hrs after BA administration and moderately increased again two weeks later. Interestingly, among all the cytokines the levels of IL1b were significantly attenuated in IL6K O mice at day 14 compared to WT and HampKO animals. Moreover, transferrin saturation and NTBI levels were higher in HampKO and DKO animals compared to IL6KO mice. These observations strongly suggested that BM erythropoiesis is more sensitive to inflammatory insult in presence of an excess of iron, while extramedullary erythropoiesis is mildly affected and can eventually thrive under supra-physiological transferrin saturation levels. To test if increased iron affects BM erythropoiesis in presence of inflammation, we treated both WT and IL6KO mice with combination of iron dextran and BA. Both WT and IL6KO mice were treated with a combination of BA and iron at day 0 followed by alternate day of iron injections showed the poorest erythropoiesis in the BM and became rapidly sick, although the effect was significantly more pronounced in WT animals, as suggested by their survival curve. Since mycobacterium infections lead to NLPR3 inflammasome activation and Caspase1 upregulation ( Marim et al. Semin Immunopathology 2017 ), we investigated how erythroid progenitors were affected. By flow cytometry analyses, we observed a significantly higher upregulation of the Caspase1 protein in WT and DKO mice compared to IL6KO animals. This was also reproduced by culturing WT or IL6KO BM progenitor erythroid cells in presence of mouse serum derived from WT or IL6KO mice treated with BA. Most importantly, IL6KO mice treated with BA and iron showed the highest levels of Caspase1 compared to only BA treated IL6KO mice, indicating that excess of iron abrogates the beneficial effect of IL6 deficiency on erythropoiesis under conditions of AI. Furthermore, using flow cytometry, we observed in WT mice treated with BA or BA and iron a significant increase in mitochondrial mass, which is an indicator of mitochondrial stress. The mitochondrial mass was reduced in IL6KO mice treated with BA, but again increased in IL6KO mice treated with BA and iron. We have also observed an increase of mitochondrial superoxide by confocal microscopy in WT mice compared to IL6KO mice treated with BA. Altogether, these data support a model where inflammation in presence of an excess of iron impairs BM erythropoiesis through mechanisms at least in part mediated by Caspase1 and mitochondrial dysfunction, while iron excess itself is sufficient to boost extramedullary erythropoiesis to compensate and sustain RBC production.
