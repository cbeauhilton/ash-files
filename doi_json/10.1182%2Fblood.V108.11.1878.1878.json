    "abstract_text": "Background: ASNase is a critical treatment component in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). As ASNase is a bacterial protein, production of anti-ASNase Ab, often associated with clinical allergy, poses a frequent problem during ASNase therapy. Sixty percent of higher risk ALL patients, who received native ASNase in induction, were Ab(+) by 5 months into therapy (Panosyan et al., 2004). Moreover, 22%\u201329% of these patients had no clinical allergy (silent hypersensitivity) and were at increased risk for relapse. Patients and Methods: Physicians from 13 institutions submitted samples for 48 children in first remission, aged 14 to 252 months, on various SR or HR ALL protocols with suspected ASNase allergy. The male/female ratio was 1.4. The serum samples were assessed for ASNase activity and anti-ASNase Ab as reported earlier (Avramis, et al., Blood 2002). Ab titer is expressed as the numeric ratio relative to an Ab negative control. Results: Allergic symptoms ranged from localized skin rash and swelling to respiratory difficulties and/or anaphylaxis. Neutralizing anti-PEG-ASNase Ab\u2019s were seen in 41 patients (85%). The results were examined with respect to age, gender, ASNase formulation received, time of post-ASNase administration, and the physician\u2019s clinical observations. Higher Ab ratios > 1.1 correlated with low or no ASNase activity post-PEG-ASNase (46/48 patients) or post-Native ASNase dosing (2 patients). Fourteen patients had cutaneous manifestations (rash, hives, urticaria). All had neutralizing Ab and no enzymatic activity. Nine had higher Ab ratios and 5 had lower Ab ratios. Eight additional patients had localized or generalized swelling; all had higher Ab ratios. Similarly, over the entire CCG-1961 study, 526/1100 patients had a clinical reaction; 476/526 had higher Ab ratios (90%). Conclusions: We found neutralizing Ab in 85% of patients with apparent clinical ASNase allergy. Neutralizing Ab was correlated with lower or absent ASNase activity. Lower Ab ratios may be associated with earlier time points in the anamnestic response. In the remaining 15% of patients with an apparent clinical reaction, we found no Ab and substantial ASNase activity. Monitoring ASNase activity and Ab may be useful for guiding ASNase therapy. Patients with no Ab and substantial activity, might be rechallenged with the same product despite an apparent allergic reaction."
