    "abstract_text": "Imatinib mesylate (IM) is highly effective in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, resistance of malignant progenitors to elimination by IM remains a clinical challenge and new strategies to improve elimination of residual primitive CML cells are required. The polyamide-chlorambucil conjugate 1R-Chl has been developed with the rationale that coupling to a polyamide will increase the DNA sequence specificity of the alkylating agent, and decrease unwanted side effects while retaining the ability to kill cancer cells. In previous studies 1R-Chl was shown to inhibit growth of K562 CML cells in vitro and in vivo ( Mol Cancer Ther.  2008 ; 7 : 769 ). Histone H4c, which is highly expressed in a wide range of cancer cells, was identified as a gene target of 1R-Chl. H4c downregulation was associated with chromatin decondensation, possibly exposing otherwise hidden 1R-Chl binding sites. The purpose of the current studies was to investigate whether 1R-Chl could effectively induce apoptosis and inhibit growth of primary CML hematopoietic progenitors. CD34+ progenitors obtained from untreated CML patients and from healthy donors were cultured for 96 hours in growth factor supplemented medium in a range of concentrations of 1R-Chl (0\u20131\u03bcM), its inactive stereoisomer 1S-Chl (0\u20131\u03bcM), and with 5\u03bcM IM for comparison. Cells were labeled with CFSE prior to culture and with Annexin-V at culmination of culture to allow flow cytometry assessment of the effects of drug exposure on cell proliferation and apoptosis. In addition CD34+ cells incubated under the same conditions were plated in methylcellulose progenitor culture to assess effects on colony forming cell (CFC) growth. 1R-Chl treatment resulted in significantly increased apoptosis of CML CD34+ cells (from 5.0\u00b11.2% [control] to 41.2\u00b18.0% ([1\u03bcM 1R-Chl], n=6, p=001). In contrast, 1S-Chl (1\u03bcM) or IM (5\u03bcM) treatment did not significantly increase CML CD34+ cell apoptosis. Importantly 1R-Chl, 1S-Chl and IM treatment did not significantly increase apoptosis in normal CD34+ cells (n=3). Combined treatment with 1R-Chl and IM did not result in increased apoptosis of CML CD34+ cells compared to 1R-Chl alone (n=3). Analysis of CFSE fluorescence indicated that 1R-Chl treatment induced dose dependent reduction in proliferation of CML CD34+ progenitors (proliferation relative to untreated cells of 0.39\u00b10.1 with 1\u03bcM 1R-Chl, n=4\u20136, p=.01) with an IC50 value of 0.4\u03bcM. The antiproliferative effects of 1R-Chl were significantly greater than those of 1S-Chl (0.6\u00b10.2, n=4\u20136, p=.02) and IM (0.6\u00b10.1, n=4\u20136, p=.03). Minor antiproliferative effects were observed in normal controls (0.8\u00b10.1, n=3, p=.0005 [1\u03bcM 1R-Chl]; 0.9\u00b10.1, n=3, p=.008 [1\u03bcM 1S-Chl] and 0.98\u00b10.1, n=3, p=NS [5\u03bcM IM]). The combination of IM and 1R-Chl did not result in further reduction in proliferation of CML CD34+ cells compared to 1R-Chl alone (n=3). A trend towards an increased proportion of undivided cells was observed in response to 1R-Chl, 1S-Chl and IM treatment (from 1.5\u00b10.5% [control] to 19.1\u00b18.7%, 4.4\u00b11.9%, and 11.3\u00b16.7%, n=4\u20136, respectively). CML CFC growth was suppressed by 96.0\u00b11.5% by 1\u03bcM 1R-Chl (n=4\u20135, p<.001) with an IC50 value of 0.25\u03bcM. In comparison, 1S-Chl did not significantly inhibit CML CFC growth and IM suppressed CFC CML growth by 76.1\u00b18.9% (n=4\u20135, p<.001). 1R-Chl (1\u03bcM) suppressed normal CFC growth by 59.3\u00b113.9% (n=3, p=.005, IC50=0.88\u03bcM), whereas 1S-Chl and IM did not significantly inhibit normal CFC growth. In summary we observed that the alkylating agent-polyamide conjugate 1R-Chl exerted significant and selective pro-apoptotic and antiproliferative effects on CML CD34+ progenitors. The pro-apoptotic effects of 1R-Chl were more potent than those observed with IM, although as with IM treatment, non-dividing CML progenitors were not eliminated. We conclude that 1R-Chl demonstrates considerable activity against primary CML progenitors and that further studies of its potential role in CML therapy are warranted.",
