    "abstract_text": "Aim: To evaluate the efficacy and safty of TPO in combination with eltrombopag in the treatment of solid tumor chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT). Methods: 7 patients with thrombocytopenia after standard solid tumor chemotherapy were enrolled in this study, including gastric cancer(n=1), breast cancer(n=1), lung cancer(n=3) and liver cancer(n=2). They were treated with TPO (15000IU q.i.d.) in combination with eltrombopag (25mg t.i.d.) until the platelet count was recovered to 100 \u00d7 10 9 / L or the medication time was up to 14 days. The time required for platelets to recover to > 50 \u00d7 10 9 / L and \u2265 100 \u00d7 10 9 / L, platelet transfusion times and adverse reactions were observed. Results: After the treatment, the platelet counts of all patients were recovered to > 50 \u00d7 10 9 / L, and 3 of them \u2265 100 \u00d7 10 9 / L. The adverse reactions include muscle soreness(n=1), liver and kidney dysfunction(n=1), no case of them was above grade 3 according to WHO classification criteria for adverse reactions. Conclusion: TPO in combination with eltrombopag is an effective and safe method for the treatment of solid tumor chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT).
