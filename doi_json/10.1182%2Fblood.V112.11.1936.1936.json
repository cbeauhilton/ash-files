    "abstract_text": "High dose cytarabine (HiDAC) is the most effective single agent studied to date for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML); clofarabine (CLOF) is also an active single agent in AML. Preclinical data suggest synergy between cytarabine and clofarabine. Based on the results of a limited phase 1 trial ( Blood  2006 ; 108 : 221b ), we conducted a phase 2 study of HiDAC (2g/m 2 over 3 hours) followed immediately by CLOF (40 mg/m 2 infused over 2 hours), given daily for 5 days, in 39 adults with AML in first relapse (n = 27), second relapse (n = 3), or refractory to initial induction chemotherapy (n = 9). Prophylactic intravenous hydrocortisone was incorporated to decrease the occurrence of skin toxicity. Patients with persistent leukemia on day 12\u201314 (n = 12) received a second course of HiDAC \u2192 CLOF for 3 days. The mean age was 53.4 years (range 18.4 \u2013 79.0). Accrual began March 2006 and was completed in July 2008. Thirtyseven of 39 patients are evaluable for response (two patients were treated recently and are not included in this analysis): 14/37 achieved a complete remission (CR), 2/37 a CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) for an overall response (CR or CRi) in 16/37 (43%; 95% CI 27 \u2013 59%). Twelve of 37 (32%) patients had resistant disease, 3/37 (8%) died of complications during marrow aplasia, 5/37 (14%) died of complications of their AML with unknown bone marrow status, and 1/37 (3%) refused further evaluation or treatment. CR or CRi was achieved in 11/25 patients in first relapse, 2/3 in second relapse, and 3/9 with refractory AML. Twelve patients received a second induction \u2013 2/12 (17%) achieved a CR and 1/12 (8%) a CRi. Toxicity data are complete in 36 patients; the most frequent grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities were transient elevations of AST/ALT observed in 23/36 (64%) patients, hyperbilirubinemia in 8/36 (22%), infection in 16/36 (44%), and rash in 8/36 (22%). Patients who achieved CR or CRi received up to 3 additional courses of HiDAC \u2192 CLOF each daily for 5 days. Twenty-seven of 39 (69%) patients have died with a median survival of 119 days (95% CI 71 \u2013 322 days). In summary, HiDAC \u2192 CLOF is a very active combination in adults with relapsed and refractory AML, a group in whom CR/CRi rates of 30\u201335% are achieved with many salvage regimens. Toxicities are comparable to other salvage regimens with transient elevations in transaminases identified as the most frequent toxicity.",
