    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3864 Poster Board III-800 Background Among patients with multiple myeloma, superior drug combinations and the wider application of early intensive therapy (HDT) have induced more frequent partial (PR) and complete remissions (CR), with consequent longer survival. A recent multivariate analysis identified complete or partial remission status, ISS Stage I disease and HDT as independent variables for long survival and we therefore sought to examine these relationships further. Methods We updated our experience with 829 patients, aged <65, who had been treated between 1987- 2008 with various dexamethasone-based combinations (D). Results Induction therapy was followed by early HDT within first year for 53% of patients, so that the myeloma of 21% of patients was in CR within 18 months. Frequencies of CR increased serially from 16% with primary D (alone, with interferon, melphalan or VAD), to 29% with added thalidomide (T) and to 42% with added T and bortezomib (or lenalidomide) (p10 years who had been treated with primary D between 1987 -1997. Using the log rank test, the median age was less (46 vs 54, p=.04), while the chi-square test showed ISS Stage I more common (64 vs 40%, p=.11), and early HDT more frequent (73 vs 26%, p.10-19 years (median 16.2 years). Thus, prolonged CR was more frequent with younger age, stage I disease, and early HDT. Conclusions Assuming that prolonged CR for more than 10 years translates into potential cure, we calculated a \u201ccure fraction\u201d of 2% for patients treated between 1987 -1997. Such favorable outcome with potential cure should be more likely with current programs associated with more frequent HDT and CR. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
