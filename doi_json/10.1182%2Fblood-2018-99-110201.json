    "abstract_text": "Background: CHOP plus rituximab (R-CHOP) is the standard of care for previously untreated DLBCL. R-CHOP comprises CHOP and one-dose rituximab in each 21-day cycle; however, the schedule of rituximab administration has not been fully optimized. Dose-dense rituximab was expected to increase its peak concentration to enhance the synergistic effect with chemotherapy at early phase of treatment. To compare weekly administration of rituximab combined with CHOP (RW-CHOP) with standard R-CHOP in patients with previously untreated DLBCL, we conducted a multicenter, randomized phase II/III study (JCOG0601, UMIN000000929). Methods: Previously untreated patients with CD20+ DLBCL were eligible. Other major inclusion criteria were as follows: aged 20-79 years; ECOG performance status 0-2, at least 1 measurable lesion and preserved organ functions. At the beginning of the study, patients with advanced stage disease and the low or low-intermediate risk group by the International Prognostic Index (IPI) were eligible. These criteria were amended in September 2010 to allow enrollment of the patients with any IPI risk and any clinical stage because of slow accrual. Patients were randomly assigned to standard R-CHOP (rituximab 375 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 , doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 , vincristine 1.4 mg/m 2 [max 2 mg], all IV on day 1, and prednisone 100 mg/day PO [40mg/m 2 for aged >65] on days 1-5, every 3 weeks) or RW-CHOP (standard CHOP with eight doses of weekly rituximab [375mg/m 2 IV on days1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43 and 50]). Six cycles of CHOP were given in stage I non-bulky patients, 8 cycles were given in stage I bulky and II-IV patients, and rituximab was given 8 times regardless of cycles of CHOP. Randomization was stratified by institution, presence or absence of bulky mass and patient age. The primary endpoint of phase III part was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AE). Assuming 3-year PFS in the R-CHOP arm to be 77% and expecting a 7% increase in 3-year PFS of the RW-CHOP arm, required sample size was 211 per arm with a one-sided alpha of 5%, power of 80%, an accrual period of 7 years, and a follow-up period of 3 years. Results: Between December 2007 and December 2014, a total of 422 patients were randomized to study treatments but primary analysis was performed in 421 patients: 213 to the R-CHOP arm and 208 to the RW-CHOP arm, because of one consent withdrawal. Baseline characteristics of 421 eligible patients were as follows (R-CHOP vs. RW-CHOP): median age, 61 vs. 62 years; male sex, 54.5% vs. 55.8%; Ann Arbor stage I/II/III/IV, 14.6/32.9/26.8/25.8% vs. 16.3/42.8/20.2/20.7%; and IPI score \u22642, 77.0% vs. 87.5%. With a median follow-up of 63.4 months (range: 3.2-119.2) among all patients, there was no significant difference in PFS between the arms (hazard ratio [HR], 0.95; 90.6% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 1.31; one-sided log-rank P = 0.39). The 3-year PFS and OS were 79.2% and 88.7% with the R-CHOP arm and 80.3% and 90.4% with the RW-CHOP arm, respectively. The complete response rate and overall response rate were 77.0% and 93.0% in the R-CHOP arm and 82.2% and 91.8% in the RW-CHOP arm, respectively. Major AEs were hematological toxicities and infections. Grade (G) 3/4 neutropenia and G 3/4 thrombocytopenia were observed in 97.7% and 8.0% in the R-CHOP arm and 97.1% and 5.3% in the RW-CHOP arm, respectively. G3 febrile neutropenia was occurred in 33.8% in the R-CHOP arm and in 22.1% in the RW-CHOP arm. The frequency of severe AE was 2.3% in the R-CHOP arm and 3.8% in the RW-CHOP arm. Safety profile was comparable. No unexpected AEs were experienced. Conclusion: In combination of standard CHOP and rituximab, dose-dense weekly rituximab at early phase of treatment did not improve the PFS in patients with untreated DLBCL. Figure.
