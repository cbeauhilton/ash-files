    "abstract_text": "The human AF4 gene (4q21) is recurrently involved in recipro cal translocations to the MLL gene (11q23), correlated with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in infants and early childhood. The t(4;11) translocation is one of the most frequent MLL translocations known today. In general, MLL translocations are the result of an illegitimate recombination process leading to reciprocal fusions of unrelated translocation partner (TP) genes with the MLL gene. Due to the constant presence of the derivative(11) product, the hypothesis was posed that only MLL\u2022TP fusion genes are responsible for the leukemogenic process. This concept has been successfully tested for some known MLL fusions, while some other MLL fusions failed. Here, we demonstrate growth transforming potential of AF4 wildtype and the AF4\u2022MLL fusion protein. The underlying oncogenic mechanism involves the two E3 ubiquitin ligases SIAH1 and SIAH2, the N-terminal portion of AF4 and the protection of the AF4\u2022MLL fusion protein against proteosomal degradation.
