    "abstract_text": "We will discuss exciting new data regarding the role of pseudogenes, long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) and miRNAs in the pathogenesis of leukemia and lymphoma, as also studied in vivo in the mouse, and their therapeutic implications. We will also focus on competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), circular(circ)-ceRNAs and pseudo-ceRNAs and give important attention to how understanding their cross-talk and the ceRNA language will facilitate efforts to deconvolute ceRNA networks and their role in the pathogenesis of hematopoietic malignancies.
