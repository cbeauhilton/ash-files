    "abstract_text": "Abstract 737 Introduction: Trends over the last 40 years have led to a more complete disclosure of cancer-related information to the patients. Previous studies in non-haematological cancers have shown that patients want to receive information about their health as clearly as possible, and this includes limiting the use of medical jargon. In contrast to other neoplasms, haematological malignancies are associated with specific terminology that does not make the malignant nature of the disease clear to the patient. In order, to analyze the disclosure of hematological malignancies and the feelings of the patients, we underwent a study with the French association of patients with Myelodsyplastic Syndromes (MDS). Methods: A four-page questionnaire with both open questions and tick-box answers was constructed. A test phase was conducted by a psychologist through 8 phone interviews. The questionnaire was then sent to the 150 members of the association ((Conna\u0302\u0131tre et Combattre les Mye\u0301lodysplasies)) between November 2009 and January 2010. 73 questionnaires were screened. To precise some ambiguous answers, a few patients were interviewed on the phone by the psychologist. Results: The answers on feelings after diagnosis disclosure were classified in two groups \u201cserenity/neutrality\u201d and \u201cupset/obtuseness\u201d. Among the 53 questionnaires with sufficient data to allow this classification, 22 belonged to the first group, the terms used were: \u201creassured, confidence, hope, calm, clear explanations\u201d, or for the patients with neutral feelings \u201cwe shall see, I was not shocked\u201d. In contrast, 31 patients expressed negative feelings about imminent death (5 cases) \u201cfatal issue, beginning of the end, very short future\u201d, a shock (6) \u201chit on the head, dazed\u201d, a severe disease (5), incredulity (10 cases) \u201cI thought it was about somebody else.\u201d or mixed feelings (5) \u201csevere disease, abandoned with a 6 months appointment\u201d. This classification was not linked to age (median 70 years) but to gender: women more frequently reported a negative feeling than men (60% in the first group versus 30% in the second). We then compared the expectations of the patients concerning diagnosis disclosure with their experience (Table). Although the expectations did not differ between the two groups, there appeared a discrepancy between expectations and experience among patients with negative feelings concerning information given.

Although patients mostly understood they had a \u201cchronic bone marrow disease\u201d, some complained about \u201ca mystery\u201d, and asked for the use of words \u201cless difficult to understand, or of simple words\u201d. Ten patients reported the use of \u201cleukaemia\u201d or \u201cpre-leukemia\u201d; they claimed for a strong distinction between MDS and leukaemia: \u201cMDS, nobody knows, but leukaemia is very scary\u201d. Eight patients (11%) pronounced or wrote the terms \u201ccancer\u201d or \u201cpre-cancer\u201d: \u201calthough nobody dared to pronounce this word, I think my disease is a cancer\u201d, \u201cdoctors should say cancer or disease close to cancer because MDS nobody understands\u201d. When \u201ccancer\u201d was associated with anxiety, it seemed to be due to questioning about whether or not their diseases were malignant. Discussion: Although patients ask doctors to behave with humanity, they ask them to give information that they can understand. To our knowledge, very few studies explored the expectations of the patients with haematological malignancy concerning diagnosis disclosure. It did not directly explore the question of the use of the words \u201ccancer\u201d or \u201cleukaemia\u201d in diagnosis disclosure. Our study reveals a discrepancy between the meanings of the terms used by doctors and their understanding by patients: although a precise terminology is used to inform patients, the frequent avoidance of the word \u201ccancer\u201d may lead to misunderstanding of the disease or to \u201cnondisclosure\u201d of the malignant disease.
