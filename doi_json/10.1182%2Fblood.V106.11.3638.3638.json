    "abstract_text": "Alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein ( AHSP ) was identified in a screen for genes that are activated by the erythroid transcription factor, GATA-1. Studies have shown that: AHSP binds specifically to the \u03b1 chain of hemoglobin (Hb) but not to \u03b2 Hb or Hb A; AHSP knock-out mice demonstrated pathological features similar to \u03b2 thalassemia; and loss of AHSP exacerbates severity of disease in \u03b2 thalassemia mice. The evidence suggests that AHSP acts as a chaperone for free \u03b1 Hb and that altered AHSP expression levels could modify the severity of \u03b2 thalassemia in humans. To assess variation of AHSP expression, mRNA levels were measured in peripheral blood reticulocytes of 103 healthy individuals by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The sample was approximately 90% (91/103) female with an average age of 52 years (SD=0.14, min=18, max=76). AHSP expression relative to GAPDH , varied up to 3-fold, and did not correlate with age or sex. A systematic survey of the genomic region encompassing the AHSP locus revealed 8 sequence variants of which six were common - five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and one homopolymer (Tn) at position 160 bp upstream of exon 1. Four variants (c.-69\u2013237A, c.-69\u2013160 T18, c.-4\u201327G, and c. 337T) showed strong association with AHSP expression and had nearly equal frequencies. The four variants are in near complete linkage disequilibrium with the minor alleles in coupling. The haplotype consisting of the four minor alleles termed clade B, was associated with relatively lower expression of AHSP . Relative expression of AHSP and AHSP/\u03b1 globin ratio were both significantly higher (p<0.001) in homozygotes for clade A haplotypes compared to heterozygotes. A potential functional role of one of the variable sites, a T-homopolymer (the T18 variant being part of clade A) in the promoter was investigated in-vitro using luciferase reporter assays in K562 cells. Luciferase activity was 1.30\u00b10.08 times higher in the T18 promoter compared to T14, consistent with genetic studies. We investigated if a shorter homopolymer could have an adverse effect on \u03b2 thalassemia. Nine patients with thalassemia intermedia and a genotypic combination of heterozygous \u03b2 thalassemia and 5 \u03b1 globin genes (aaa/aa) were studied. Based on the allele frequencies in the healthy population, 6\u20137 of the 9 patients are expected to be homozygous for T18 but only two were observed. In contrast, while 2\u20133 patients are expected to be heterozygous for the shorter homopolymer, 3 patients were homozygous and 4 heterozygous. In conclusion, AHSP gene expression is variable, with cis control accounting for some of its variance. The subtle altered expression might precipitate a phenotype of thalassemia intermedia in \u03b2 thalassemia heterozygotes with \u03b1 globin overload.",
