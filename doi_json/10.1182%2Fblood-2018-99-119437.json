    "abstract_text": "Introduction Several studies have shown that the minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients has a prognostic value after induction and consolidation therapy. Nevertheless the relapse is the most important cause of treatment failure in these patients, although they achieved a negative MRD, and even after an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Nowadays, the value of the MRD before allogeneic BMT is still controversial. Method Multicentric study where we have studied correlative AML patients who went under an allo-HSCT in a situation of complete response, between 2012 and April'18. The MRD was analyzed by 8-coloured multiparametric flow cytometry, at least with 2 tubes per patient and 1,000,000 events per tube. We evaluated the prognostic value of the MRD before allo-HSCT. Results Between January'12 and April'18 we have gathered 90 allogeneic BMT in AML patients who were in CR, with a median age of 45 years old (17 - 66). The pre-HSCT situation was 1 st complete remission (CR) in 75 patients and 2 nd CR in 15. In 45 patients the conditioning regimen was myeoablative. In the group of patients (67) where we could know the risk group at diagnosis, the distribution was: low risk 18%, intermediate risk 59.7% and high risk 22.4%. The 46.7% of the donors were not related. In the last follow-up after allo-HSCT 24 patients have suffered a relapse (26.7%) and 41 (45.5%) have died (17 cases of mortality related to the transplant and 24 not related). In the global analysis the median follow-up of the overall survival (OS) was 37.5 months. Among the 90 patients, MRD was valuable in 86. Ten of 59 patients (16.9%) with negative MRD relapsed vs 12/27 (44.4%) with positive MRD, p= 0.016. If we consider only patients in 1 st CR, 9/50 (18%) patients with negative MRD relapsed vs 10/22 (45.5%) with positive MRD, p= 0.02. This statistically significant difference does not exist if we consider only patients in 2 nd CR. The median follow-up of OS and event free survival (EFS) was not reached in the negative MRD group and 571 days and 299 days in the positive MRD group. OS and EFS at 2 years after transplantation were 65% and 64% in the negative MRD group and 42% and 37% in the positive MRD group, p= 0.03 and p= 0.008 respectively (figure 1). Conclusions The detected MRD by 8-colour multiparametric flow cytometry previous an allo-HSCT in patients with AML in 1 st CR is a prognostic factor in terms of relapse. Patients with a positive MRD before the allo-HSCT have a poorer OS and EFS than the patients with a negative MRD. Figure 1. View large Download slide Figure 1.
