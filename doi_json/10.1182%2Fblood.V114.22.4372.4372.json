    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4372 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable disease, which is at least partly attributable to the majority of cells being in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and expressing high levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Despite their prolonged survival in vivo , CLL cells rapidly undergo spontaneous apoptosis in vitro , suggesting that survival signals in vivo have been lost in in vitro culture conditions. CD160, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked surface antigen, was found to be expressed by CLL cells. In normal NK and T-cells, CD160 mediates cellular growth and activation, but its role in CLL is unclear. Using monoclonal antibodies to CD160 (CL1-R2 or BY55 - non cross blocking) led to increased expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 anti-apoptotic proteins and protected CLL from spontaneous apoptosis in vitro - mean cell viability increased from 66.8 to 79.4% (n = 17, p = 0.02). These CD160-mediated events were also accompanied by decreased cytochrome C release and prevention of mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, indicating stabilization of both inner and outer mitochondrial membrane integrity. PI3K/AKT signalling is a well known survival pathway in cancer cells and in normal lymphocytes CD160 has been shown to act via PI3K/AKT. Activation of CD160 in CLL led to phosphorylated AKT, while inhibition of PI3K by wortmannin completely blocked AKT phosphorylation and CD160-mediated protection from apoptosis. In summary, the activation of CD160 protected CLL cells from spontaneous cell death in vitro via a PI3-kinase/AKT pathway. This improved survival was also associated with increased Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 expression and preservation of mitochondrial function. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
