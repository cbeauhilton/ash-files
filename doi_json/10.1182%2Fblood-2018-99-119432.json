    "abstract_text": "Introduction Targeted antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) to mouse CD45 or mouse CD117 have recently been shown to effectively prepare immunocompetent mice for whole bone marrow transplants (Palchaudhuri et al . Nature Biotech 2016 34:738-745; and Czechowicz et al. Blood 2016 128:493). This new targeted approach to conditioning using ADCs has the potential to expand the utility of transplantation if it can be successfully translated to humans. The anti-CD45 or anti-CD117 antibodies used previously were coupled to saporin (SAP), a ribosome-inhibiting protein, which once internalized elicits cytotoxicity in a cell cycle-independent manner. Both anti-CD45-saporin (CD45-SAP) and anti-CD117-saporin (CD117-SAP) ADCs have been shown to effectively deplete bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) as single dosed agents, creating vacancies that enable efficient autologous HSC engraftment (>95% long-term donor chimerism). Results To further investigate and develop the utility of these tool ADCs in murine transplant models, we explored CD45-SAP (1.9 mg/kg, iv) and CD117-SAP (1 mg/kg, iv) in an allogeneic minor mismatch transplant model (Balb/c donor into DBA/2 recipients). The ADCs were used alone or in combination with an additional immune depleting agent, clone 30F11 (25 mg/kg, IP), a naked anti-CD45 antibody that mimics ATG by relying on effector function to enable potent peripheral B- and T -cell depletion. In addition to the lymphodepleting antibody, we included post-transplant Cytoxan (200 mg/kg, IP) to prevent GvHD. To compare the CD45-SAP and CD117-SAP to conventional conditioning methods, we investigated sub-lethal total body irradiation (TBI, 2Gy) or pre-transplant Cytoxan (200 mg/kg, IP) in combination with the immunosuppressants. Conditioned mice were transplanted with 2x10 7 whole bone marrow cells, and chimerism assessed over 12 weeks. CD45-SAP or CD117-SAP in combination with immunosuppressants (30F11 and post-transplant Cytoxan) enabled >85% peripheral donor chimerism at 12 weeks post-transplantation. Multilineage reconstitution was observed in the T-, B- and myeloid cell compartments with >80%, >90% and >90% donor chimerism respectively in both CD45-SAP and CD117-SAP groups. In contrast, 2Gy TBI in combination with immunosuppressants (30F11 and post-transplant Cytoxan) resulted in only 5% donor engraftment. Multi-dosing with 30F11 (QDx3) plus 2Gy TBI and post-transplant Cytoxan increased the peripheral donor chimerism to 40%. Pre-transplant Cytoxan plus 30F11 (QDx3) and post-transplant Cytoxan yielded 20% donor chimerism. For all groups, stem cell chimerism in the bone marrow matched the peripheral chimerism. Conclusion These results indicate anti-CD45 or anti-CD117 ADCs may be used in combination with immunosuppression to enable highly efficient allogeneic transplants in a minor mismatch model (>85% donor chimerism). CD45-SAP and CD117-SAP were more effective at conditioning versus 2Gy TBI or pre-transplant Cytoxan. Future experiments will investigate anti-CD45 and anti-CD117 ADCs in additional allogeneic models.
