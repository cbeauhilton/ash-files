    "abstract_text": "Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that adds telomeric sequences onto chromosome ends. During hematopoiesis, telomerase activity is high in proliferating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, but decreases sharply as cells differentiate. Approximately 90% of all human cancers are telomerase positive, including samples from AML patients. To understand the role of telomerase in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, and in the development of leukemia, we established stable long-term cultures expressing high levels of telomerase by retrovirus-mediated transduction of the h-TERT (catalytic subunit of telomerase) gene into AML1-ETO-expressing CD34+ (AE) cells. We have previously shown that these AE cells maintain CD34 expression and proliferate for 7 months in culture but gradually lose telomere length and are not immortal, providing a good model for studying the molecular mechanisms involved in telomere shortening. Strikingly, telomerase expression enhanced the self-renewal ability of the human hematopoietic progenitor cells, as shown by continuous replating ability in methylcellulose assays. We also detected a pronounced delay in the differentiation of the progenitor cells upon telomerase expression, and an expansion of the progenitor pool. Telomerase expression promoted proliferation due to increased cell cycle progression as well as a survival advantage. At the same time, these cells demonstrated a progressive decline in telomere length, despite telomerase activity equivalent to that detected in leukemia cell lines. We conclude that expression of hTERT expands the pool of hematopoietic progenitors but does not maintain long telomeres in human CD34+ cells. hTERT plays a critical role not only in telomere homeostasis for genetic stability but also in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and self-renewal, functions that may be part of hTERT involvement in leukemogenesis. These data open an important debate regarding the specific contribution of telomerase expression to the leukemic phenotype and the potential timing of this essential hit in the progression of the disease.",
