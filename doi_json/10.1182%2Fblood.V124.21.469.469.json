    "abstract_text": "Enhanced plasma clearance of von Willebrand factor (VWF) plays an important role in the etiology of both type 1 and type 2 VWD. Nevertheless, although significant progress has been achieved in understanding the structure and functional properties of VWF, the mechanism(s) responsible for modulating VWF clearance from the plasma remain poorly understood. Accumulating recent data suggests that hepatic and splenic macrophages play key roles in modulating VWF clearance. A number of putative macrophage receptors for VWF have been also been described, including LRP1, \u03b22-integrins and Siglec-5. In addition, it is well recognised that variation in VWF glycan expression significantly influences its clearance rate. In particular, terminal ABO(H) blood group determinants which are predominantly expressed on the N-linked glycans of human VWF significantly modulate its rate of clearance. Critically however, the molecular mechanisms through which specific macrophage receptors interact with particular regions of the complex VWF glycoprotein have not been defined. To investigate the role of VWF glycans and specific VWF domains in regulating VWF clearance, we expressed and purified a series of recombinant VWF variants and truncations with/without specific glycan sites. In addition, VWF glycosylation was modified using specific exoglycosidase digestions. Subsequently, recombinant VWF variants and glycoforms thereof were injected into VWF -/- mice, and plasma VWF clearance rates determined by ELISA. VWF-macrophage interactions were also quantified in vitro using phorbol ester-differentiated monocytic THP-1 cells, and primary human monocytes, in a High Content Analysis Imaging system. In keeping with previous reports, we observed that clearance of a truncated VWFA1A2A3 fragment in VWF -/- mice was very similar to that of full-length wild type (WT-) VWF (VWFA1A2A3; t1/2 = 6.3 min versus rWT-VWF; t1/2 = 7.9 min). Furthermore, chemical depletion of macrophages using clodronate liposomes administration significantly inhibited A1A2A3 clearance in vivo (1.7-fold at 10 min time point) to a similar extent to that observed with full length VWF. In vitro binding experiments confirmed that A1A2A3 bound to differentiated THP-1 cells in a dose- and time- dependent manner. Interestingly, this binding was significantly enhanced in the presence of ristocetin. Cumulatively, these data demonstrate that the A1A2A3 domains of VWF contain a critical receptor-binding site for macrophage-mediated clearance. Interestingly, we observed that the half-life of infused human plasma-derived VWF and recombinant VWF expressed in HEK293T cells in VWF -/- mice were significantly different. Furthermore, treatment with PNGase F to completely remove N-linked glycan structures markedly enhanced the clearance of full length VWF (t1/2 2.1 min; p<0.05). Collectively, these findings highlight the essential roles played by N-glycans in regulating VWF survival. Two N-linked glycan sites are located within A1A2A3 at N1515 and N1574 respectively. Importantly, we found that PNGase digestion of A1A2A3 resulted in markedly enhanced macrophage binding in vitro. Consequently we hypothesized that the two N-glycans located within the A2 domain might be important in regulating VWF clearance by macrophages. Targeted disruption of these individual N-glycan sites by site-directed mutagenesis (A1A2A3-N1515Q and A1A2A3-N1574Q respectively) resulted in significantly enhanced macrophage binding in vitro compared to wild type A1A2A3. Furthermore, following tail vein infusion in VWF -/- mice, full length VWFN1515Q and VWFN1574Q both demonstrated markedly reduced half-lives compared to wild type VWF (VWFN1515Q; t1/2 = 3.7 min, VWFN1574Q; t1/2 = 5.5 min). Finally, introduction of the N1515Q point mutation into truncated A1A2A3 also served to significantly enhance plasma clearance, (A1A2A3N1515Q-VWF; t1/2 = 3.1 min versus A1A2A3-VWF; t1/2 = 6.3 min). In conclusion, our novel data identify a crucial role of the VWF A domains in regulating macrophage-mediated VWF clearance. In addition, we further demonstrate that the N-linked glycans structures located at N1515 and N1574 within the A2 domain play specific roles in protecting VWF against in vivo clearance by macrophages. Given the important role played by enhanced VWF clearance in the etiology of type I VWD, these findings are of direct clinical importance. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
