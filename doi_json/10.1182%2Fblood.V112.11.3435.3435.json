    "abstract_text": "Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune condition characterized by autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction and suboptimal megakaryocytic production. Primarily acute (< 6 months) in duration among children, ITP manifests predominantly chronically among adults, increasing susceptibility to bleeding events. Despite recent growth, published literature on health-related quality of life in ITP remains limited. The objective of our investigation was to identify lifestyle concerns associated with ITP among adult and pediatric patients in the United Kingdom. In collaboration with ITP specialists, a 43 question, closed-field lifestyle survey was developed, addressing social engagement, work and school performance, sports and activities, treatment, and travel. Patient members of the United Kingdom ITP Support Association (N = 1,767) were asked to complete and return mailed surveys. Pearson\u2019s chi-square and Fisher\u2019s exact tests were used to evaluate differences in dichotomized variables between groups. 790 (45%) completed surveys were returned. As illustrated in the table below, roughly one-quarter of adults (\u2265 16 years) and one-fifth of children reported \u2018always\u2019, \u2018sometimes\u2019, or \u2018often\u2019 missing school or work owing to fatigue and having encountered difficulty obtaining insurance. Nearly one-third of adults further revealed having an elective surgery delayed owing to a low platelet count. Disparities were noted across gender with regard to bruise concealment (adults: p < 0.01; children: p = 0.03) and suspicions of subjection to violence (adults: p < 0.01; children: p = 0.49). In contrast with adults, pediatric patients reported being more likely to having requests for referral denied (p = 0.03). This study represents the largest quality of life investigation of ITP to date. Although the survey utilized remains to be validated, its findings nonetheless successfully highlight avenues for future investigation.  . . Subgroups: \u2018Yes\u2019 % . . . Adults . Children .
