    "abstract_text": "Reconstitution of adaptive T-cell responses to human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is critical to protection from CMV disease following hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) or solid organ transplantation (SOT). However, there is an incomplete understanding of which CMV antigens and epitopes are most crucial to providing protective responses. The functional status of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) populations recognizing cytomegalovirus IE-1 and pp65 polypeptides was investigated in PBMC from either HSCT or SOT recipients. Our previous finding of differing levels of degranulation between CMV IE1 and pp65/pp50 specific T-cells was complicated by the possibility that differences were epitope and/or HLA-specific. We generalized the approach using a combined flow-based CD107a/b degranulation/mobilization and intracellular cytokine (ICC) assays using peptide libraries as antigens. These assays indicated that a significantly higher proportion of pp65-specific CTLs were in a more mature functional state compared to IE-1-specific CTLs. Degranulation/multicytokine ICC assays also indicated that a significantly higher proportion of the pp65-specific versus IE-1-specific CTLs secreted both IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, in addition to possessing greater cytotoxic potential. These results support our earlier findings of functional differences between CTLs recognizing individual epitopes within the IE-1 and pp65 antigens in HSCT recipients, and extend them to a broader array of HLA-restricted responses to those antigens. A report that a subset of HIV-1 specific CTLs capable of producing both IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 was associated with improved cytotoxic activity prompted us to investigate whether degranulation, a functional correlate of cytotoxicity, was positively associated with dual cytokine production and predicted differences between IE1 and pp65-specific CD8 + T-cells. A higher proportion of pp65-specific compared to IE1-specific T-cells were present in the trifunctional IFN-\u03b3 + ,TNF-\u03b1 + , CD107 + population (p=0.008) in HSCT recipients. We have extended these findings to investigate the role of donor CMV status in terms of functional maturity of CMV-specific T cell response in transplant recipients. T cell maturation/function may act as a mechanistic correlate to the survival advantage of recipients receiving a stem-cell graft from CMV sero-positive donors. These principles have also been applied to investigations of a high risk population of sero-negative recipients of a sero-positive liver allograft. Data from this study will also be reviewed in the context of the model of trifunctional T cells being indicative of enhanced protective capacity against CMV disease and associated with survival."
