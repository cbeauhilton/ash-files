    "abstract_text": "Background: Selinexor, an exportin 1 (XPO1) inhibitor, has demonstrated anti-leukemic effect as a single agent. There are also data demonstrating synergistic killing of leukemia cells with the combination of selinexor with anthracyclines and/or DNA damaging agents. The HiDAC/Mito combination is an effective induction regimen for relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML patients with a reported overall response rate (ORR) of 55% at our institution. We hypothesize that adding selinexor to HiDAC/Mito is feasible and has synergistic anti-leukemic effects. Methods: We performed a phase I dose escalation trial with cohort expansion in patients with AML that combined increasing doses of selinexor with age-adjusted HiDAC/Mito (NCT02573363). The primary endpoint was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of selinexor when given in combination with HiDAC/Mito. Selinexor was given orally on days 2, 4, 9, and 11 during the induction phase of the study. HiDAC (1.5 to 3 gm/m 2 depending on age, IV over 3 hours) followed immediately by Mito (20 to 30 mg/m 2 IV over 1 hour) was administered on day 1 and 5. Initial selinexor dose was 60mg (~35mg/m 2 ) followed by a dose escalation to a target level of 80mg (~50mg/m 2 ). Patients who entered remission proceeded to stem cell transplantation (SCT) or consolidation chemotherapy with HiDAC/selinexor followed by maintenance therapy with weekly selinexor alone for up to one year. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity, except transient (56 days in the absence of disease. Once a dose level was declared tolerable, more patients could be enrolled at that level to provide additional safety, tolerability, and efficacy data. Results: As of July 2016, 12 patients had enrolled. Selinexor dose levels were 60mg (n=3) and 80mg (n=9). Median age = 61 (range 44 - 74). De novo AML = 5 (42%); secondary AML = 3 (25%), R/R AML = 4 (33%). Eight (67%) patients were previously untreated, 1 (8%) was beyond the first relapse, and 3 (25%) had primary refractory disease. Prior therapies included combination cytarabine with anthracycline, HiDAC, decitabine, and clinical trial agents. Molecular/genetic subgroup profiles by European Leukemia Net (ELN) criteria included favorable = 1 (8%), intermediate I = 5 (42%), intermediate II = 1 (8%), and adverse = 5 (42%). Only 10 patients are evaluable for safety and efficacy at the time of analysis. Myelosuppression was the most common side effect and was universal. Median and average times to count recovery for responding patients from day 1 were 38 and 47 days, respectively. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 8 patients (80%), compared to our historical experience of 64% for HiDAC/Mito alone. Other significant adverse events included line-associated thromboses (n=3), cardiac toxicity (n=3), cerebellar toxicity (n=1), arm cellulitis (n=1), and syncope (n=1). No DLTs were observed. 30 and 60-day induction mortality was 10% (1 patient with R/R AML died from progressive disease). Ten patients are evaluable for response: complete remission (CR) = 4 (40%), CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) = 1 (10%), partial remission (PR) = 1 (10%), and treatment failure (TF) = 4 (40%). Thus, the ORR is 60%. Of those who responded, 2 patients proceeded to consolidation, 1 underwent allo-SCT, and 3 are in preparation for allo-SCT. No response was achieved in patients with R/R AML. Bone marrow samples from screening and day 12 of treatment were used for biomarker analysis in three CR patients. A marked reduction in KI67, MYC, FLT3, KIT, and DNA damage response proteins was observed in the remaining tumor cells in the post-treatment samples. Staining for P53 showed an increase in nuclear staining intensity, which is consistent with the known effect of selinexor on tumor cells. Conclusions: The selinexor/HiDAC/Mito regimen is feasible and tolerable at selinexor doses up to 80mg/day or ~50 mg/m 2 /day twice weekly. It yields an ORR of 60% based on currently available data. The recommended phase II dose is 80mg of selinexor. Additional molecular correlative studies are evaluating patients' marrow and blood samples for markers that predict response and relapse.
