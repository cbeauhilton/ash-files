    "abstract_text": "Introduction . Growing evidence suggests that immune cells that reside within the tumor microenvironment are dysregulated and functionally impaired, leading to defective anti-tumor immunity of the host. One of the major immunosuppressive mechanisms during tumor progression is expansion of regulatory immune cells. Here, we analyzed the immune cells within the bone marrow (BM) and the peripheral blood (PB) of 2 immunocompetent multiple myeloma (MM) mouse models. We next studied the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in MM pathogenesis. Materials and methods. To study the immune cell populations of the BM and PB, we used two immuncompetent mouse models and transplanted VK*MYC cells or 5TGM1 cells into C57BL/6 and C57BL/Kalwrij mice respectively. The immune cell populations and checkpoint receptor expressions were analyzed by CyTOF mass cytometer or flow-cytometry. Treg induction assay was performed in vitro to study the mechanism of Treg increase in the BM of myeloma injected mice. CD4+ CD25- cells were obtained from C57BL/Kalwrij mice and were co-cultured with 5TGM1 cells or B cells from C57BL/Kalwrij mice in vitro. Treg induction was compared by flow-cytometry. Transplantable VK*MYC cells were injected into \"depletion of regulatory T cell\" (DEREG) mice, which expresses a simian diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor-enhanced GFP fusion protein under the control of the FOXP3 gene locus, or their wild type littermates. DT injection into these mice leads to depletion of Tregs as previously described (J Exp Med. 2007; 204: 57-63). DT was given once every week for a total 3 times i.p to the DEREG mice or the littermate controls to specifically deplete Tregs and to study the role of Tregs during MM progression. Tregs (CD4+ FOXP3-GFP+ cells) were sorted from VK*MYC injected mice or non-injected DEREG mice BM using FACSAria cell sorter. Cells isolated were subjected to RNA sequencing. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to define differences in molecular signatures between MM-associated and normal Tregs. Results. The Treg proportion was significantly increased within the CD4+ T cells in the BM of myeloma cell injected mice from the early stage of disease compared to control mice, while in the PB, the increase was observed only at the late stages of disease progression. The effector T cell (Teff)/Treg ratio was significantly decreased in the BM at the end-stage myeloma bearing mice (P<0.01). Checkpoint related molecules (PD-1, LAG-3 and Tim-3) on Tregs and Teffs were up-regulated at the protein level in the BM of myeloma injected mice compared to control (P<0.01). These data indicate the activation of Tregs and decrease of Teff activity, leading to suppression of anti-myeloma T cell activity in the MM BM. Under in vitro co-culture conditions, 5TGM1 cells induced a significant increase in the number of Tregs from non-Treg CD4+ T cells compared to controls (P<0.01). 5TGM1 cell-induced Tregs presented with enhanced ki-67 expression, thus suggesting the ability of MM cells to induce Treg proliferation. Additionally, the trans-well co-culture experiment showed that the major mechanism for Treg induction by 5TGM1 was by direct contact with T cells rather than secreting factors. Significant increase in survival was observed in the VK*MYC injected DEREG mice under Treg depletion compared to the DEREG mice without Treg depletion and wild type littermates under DT treatment (P<0.001). The Treg depleted DEREG mice were accompanied with an increase of Teffs (P<0.01), indicating recovery of anti-myeloma T cell activity. RNA sequencing of BM Tregs from VK*MYC injected mice showed increased expression of immune checkpoint related molecules and increased Treg effector molecules (IL-10, Granzyme B) compared to BM Tregs from control mice, indicating a more functionally active phenotype of VK*MYC associated Tregs. GSEA showed an enrichment of genes involved in type-1 interferon signaling in VK*MYC associated Tregs. Conclusions. We used 2 immunocompetent MM mouse models to study the characterization and significance of Tregs in MM progression. CyTOF analysis and RNA sequencing data indicated Treg activation in the MM BM microenvironment. The Treg in vivo depletion experiment showed that Tregs have a significant role in MM progression. These data indicate that immunotherapy targeting Tregs may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for MM. Studies are ongoing to understand the roles of Tregs in human MM patients.
