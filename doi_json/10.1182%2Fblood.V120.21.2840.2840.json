    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2840 Background: Pomalidomide in a single arm phase-I/II study and one randomized four arm phase-II study in primary myelofibrosis (MF) and post-polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia (post-PV/ET) MF showed efficacy in particular with respect to improvement in anemia. To date, pomalidomide has been evaluated in MF at two dose levels, 0.5mg and 2.0 mg/day. Aims: To evaluate clinical efficacy of pomalidomide alone and in combination with prednisolone (PRED) in patients with primary or post-PV/ET MF and cytopenia. Methods: The main inclusion criteria for primary or post-PV/ET MF patients were red blood cell (RBC)-transfusion-dependence or hemoglobin =50 years were eligible. Treatment consisted of pomalidomide (POM) 2mg/day; prednisone (PRED) 30mg/day was added in patients who did not respond (\u2264 stable disease) within three months of therapy. The primary endpoint was response assessed by IWG criteria and extended by the criterion red blood cell transfusion-independence (Gale RP et al., Leuk Res. 2011). Concurrent hydroxyurea in patients with proliferative disease and aspirin 100 mg/d in patients with platelets between 50/nl and 1000/nl were administered. The statistical design of the study was based on the Simon optimal two-stage design. Here we report on the first stage of the study. Median follow-up according to the method of Korn was 18 months. Results: Thirty-eight patients were treated with POM 2 mg/d, the median age was 71 years (range 51\u201383), 34% were female. Twenty-seven had primary and 11 post-PV/ET MF. Disease stage at study-entry according to the DIPSS was high-risk in 13 (34%), intermediate-2 risk in 22 (58%) and intermediate-1 risk in 3 (8%). Incidence of high-risk cytogenetics, JAK2 V617F mutation and MPL W515L mutation were 29% (10/34), 55% (21/38) and 18% (7/38), respectively. Twenty-seven patients (71%) were RBC-transfusion- and 7 (18%) platelet-transfusion dependent. Median duration of treatment with POM was 11.4 months with 5 patients continue on treatment 24+ months. PRED was added after 3 months in 19 of 28 eligible patients. POM dose-reduction (n=8, 1mg/d; n=2, 0.5mg/d) was performed after a median time of 34 days (range 3\u2013308 days) due to fatigue (n=2), thrombo- and/or neutropenia (n=7), rash (n=1). Seven patients with high risk characteristics (n=6 RBC-transfusion dependent, n=4 high risk cytogenetics) experienced transformation into blast phase (BP), the actuarial probability of transformation to BP measured from diagnosis was 6.0% (SE 4.1%) at 2 years and 22.4% (SE 8.4%) at 5 years. Response was observed in 14 patients (37%) after a median time of 4.8 months (n=1 complete remission, n=5 clinical improvement-platelets, n=3 clinical improvement-erythrocytes, n=5 red cell transfusion-independence); 8 responders received concomitant PRED and responded after a median of three months (range 0.8\u201311.7 months) of the addition of PRED. In 5 of 14 responders POM dose was reduced due to toxicity, notably before response occurred. Responses were observed within the first 3 months (n=4), between month 4 to 6 (n=4) and beyond month 6 (n=6) with the latest response seen at 12.7 months. There was no correlation between response and JAK2/MPL mutation status or cytogenetics. Basophilia defined as greater than 50% increase in absolute basophil count at month 3 was in trend associated with response (p=0.06). Conclusions: POM with or without PRED in patients with different risk groups of patients with primary and post-PV/ ET MF was effective with a response rate of 37%. Based on results of this first cohort the protocol was amended; i) POM dose has been adjusted to 0.5 mg/d, ii) up-front randomization of PRED at month 4 or month 7 in patients without response but stable disease to single agent POM was introduced.
