    "abstract_text": "The majority of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) reside in the bone marrow surrounded by specialized bone-shielded environment. The specialized microenvironment or niche not only provides a favorable habitat for HSPC maintenance and development but also governs stem cell function. Here we investigated the potential role of bone remodeling osteoblasts and osteoclasts in homeostasis and stress-induced mobilization of hematopoietic progenitors, then further tested the hypothesis that targeting the niche might improve stem cell\u2013based therapies using six mouse models to mimic the multiple rounds of chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transplantation in a clinical setting. Herein, we show that multiple rounds treatment of cytotoxic drugs influence niche. Serum osteocalcin level declined obviously (22.19 \u00b1 1.08 ng/mL, before treatment vs 16.08 \u00b1 2.12 ng/mL, steady state, P =0.01) in autologous HSPCs transplant patients. In mouse models, the number of CD45 - Ter119 - OPN + osteoblast was significantly reduced (untreated, 3993 \u00b1 129 cells/femur; CTLs, 1937 \u00b1196 cells/femur; Gs, 1055 \u00b1 43 cells/femur; P<0.01). Pharmacologic use of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) increases the number of HSC mobilized into the peripheral blood for stem cell harvests and protects stem cells from repeated exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Ttreatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) plus PTH led to relative preservation of the HSC pool (G vs PTH, P<0.01; CTL vs PTH, P<0.05). Recipient mice transplanted with circulation HSPCs of P+R and P+R+G groups also showed more robust myeloid and lymphatic cell engraftment than did HSCs from either CTL or G group. These data provide evidence that targeting the HSPC niche may improve the efficacy of HSPC mobilization. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
