    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1047 Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic disorder in which hyperabsorption of dietary iron leads to accumulation of iron in multiple tissues including liver and heart. A common clinical manifestation in HH patients is cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma as a result of iron-mediated injury in liver. The most prevalent genetic defect for HH is the failure to up-regulate hepcidin, a peptide hormone that inhibits the absorption of iron in duodenum and the release of iron from intracellular iron storage such as macrophages. Mutations in a number of genes have been identified as the cause for HH, including hepcidin itself. However, the most common mutation is C282Y mutation in HFE, which is a positive regulator for hepcidin expression. C282Y mutation represents about 85% of the HH population. HFE C282Y HH is an autosomal recessive disease with a \u223c50% penetrance. Currently, the only treatment available for iron overload is phlebotomy which will continue throughout the patient's life. Hepcidin is mainly expressed and secreted by the liver and its expression is regulated predominantly at the transcription level. TMPRSS6, a transmembrane serine protease mutated in iron-refractory, iron-deficient anemia, is a major suppressor for hepcidin expression. It's been demonstrated that hepcidin expression is significantly elevated in Tmprss6\u2212/\u2212 mice and reduction of TMPRSS6 in Hfe\u2212/\u2212 mice could ameliorate the iron overload phenotype (Du et al. Science 2008; Folgueras et al. Blood 2008; Finberg KE et al., Blood, 2011). Using second generation antisense technology, we identified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting mouse TMPRSS6 for the treatment of HH. These compounds were first identified through in vitro screens in mouse primary hepatocytes. After 4 weeks of treatment in C57BL/6 mice on normal chow, we observed an 80% to 90% reduction of liver TMPRSS6 mRNA with a subsequent 2\u20133 fold induction of liver hepcidin mRNA. Serum iron and transferrin saturation levels were reduced by \u223c50%. These ASOs are currently being evaluated in a diet-induced iron overload model and an Hfe\u2212/\u2212 iron overload model. Our preliminary results demonstrate that targeting TMPRSS6 is a viable approach for the treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis and possibly other iron-loading diseases associated with suppressed hepcidin levels.
