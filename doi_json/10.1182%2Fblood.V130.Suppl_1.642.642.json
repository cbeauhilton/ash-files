    "abstract_text": "Background : Tamibarotene, a new synthetic retinoid, displays (i) approximately 10-fold increased potency over ATRA at inducing in vitro differentiation of NB-4 cells (ii) enhanced chemical stability compared with ATRA (iii) low affinity for cellular RA-binding protein. The clinical efficacy of tamibarotene for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has also been reported. A prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate tamibarotene by comparison to ATRA was carried out for maintenance therapy of APL in JALSG APL204 (Shinagawa et al, 2014). The 4-year-relapse free survival (RFS) did not differ between patients treated with ATRA or tamibarotene. However, an improved efficacy of tamibarotene in high-risk patients was suggested, which warrants further investigation. Here, we evaluate the long-term outcome of the study. Patients and Methods : Patients enrolled in this study were newly diagnosed with APL and documented cytogenetic and/or molecular evidence of t(15;17)/ PML-RARA . The age of the patients ranged between 15 and 70 years and the ECOG performance status was between 0 and 3. For remission induction therapy, ATRA was administered to all patients at a daily dose of 45 mg/m 2 until complete remission (CR). The chemotherapy protocol varied depending on the initial leukocyte count and blast count in the peripheral blood. In brief, patient groups were defined as: leukocytes < 3,000/\u00b5l (Group A: ATRA alone), 3,000/\u00b5l \u2264 leukocytes < 10,000/\u00b5l (Group B: ATRA plus IDA/Ara-C: 2+5), and leukocytes \u2265 10,000/\u00b5l (Group C: ATRA plus IDA/Ara-C: 3+5). Those patients who experienced leukocytosis received additional chemotherapy (Group D). Patients who achieved molecular remission after consolidation chemotherapy were randomly assigned to 2 groups of maintenance therapy, and administered tamibarotene at a daily dose of 6 mg/m 2 divided into 2 doses for 14 days or ATRA at a daily dose of 45 mg/m 2 divided into 3 doses for 14 days. Each cycle of treatment was repeated every 3 months for 2 years. The primary endpoint was hematological or molecular relapse-free survival (RFS) during the maintenance and follow up period. This study is registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry as C000000154. Results : A total of 347 patients were enrolled in the study. Of the 344 eligible patients, 319 (93%) achieved CR. After completing three courses of consolidation therapy, 269 patients underwent maintenance random assignment; 135 patients were assigned to ATRA, and 134 patients were assigned to tamibarotene. The mean follow-up of patients alive and relapse-free at the date of last contact was 7 years. The 7-year RFS rate was 84% for the ATRA arm and 93% for the tamibarotene arm (p=0.031) (Fig.1). When the analysis was restricted to 52 high-risk patients with an initial leukocyte count \u2265 10,000/\u00b5l, the difference was more prominent (62% vs 89%, p=0.034) (Fig.2). The 7-year RFS of induction treatment for Group A (92 cases) was 91%, Group B (38 cases) 92%, Group C (52 cases) 75% and Group D (87 cases) 91% (p=0.005). Both treatments were generally well tolerated. Secondary hematopoietic disorders were observed in 12 cases, malignancies in 9 cases, late cardiac complications (grade 3 or more) in 5 cases. However, there was no significant difference in terms of these complications between the two treatment groups. Conclusions: Maintenance therapy with tamibarotene was effective at decreasing the relapse rate in APL patients by comparison to ATRA at the 7-year observation point. In particular, tamibarotene was significantly more effective than ATRA for high risk patients with leukocytes \u226710,000/\u03bcl. These results could lead to a new strategy for the treatment of high risk patients, which is one of the recent priority issues in the treatment of APL.
