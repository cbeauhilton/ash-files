    "abstract_text": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) is a multifunctional cytokine, which is overproduced in a series of hematological diseases, including acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and myelodysplasia (MDS). Apoptotic cell killing has been the most frequently documented cellular effect of TNF\u03b1 in AML cells. Much little is known about TNF\u03b1 effect in AML cells, which display an intrinsic defect in their apoptotic machinery. In this study, we describe that prolonged exposure to TNF\u03b1, but not Fas, resulted in senescence in the immature CD34 + CD38 \u2212 KG1 cell line. Indeed, TNF\u03b1-treated KG1 cells displayed growth arrest, increased senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity, telomere shortening and additional chromosomal abberations. In these cells, as well as in fresh AML cells, treatment with TNF\u03b1 resulted in decreased hTERT gene trancription and hTERT activity. Moreover, we found that ceramide production and JNK activation were critical signaling components in TNF\u03b1-induced hTERT gene inhibition. GM-CSF stimulation inhibited ceramide production, JNK activation, hTERT inhibition, and senescence markers induction. To conclude, our study suggests that, at least in some AML cells, TNF\u03b1 is a regulator of hTERT with important functional consequences in terms of growth capacity and genetic stability. Moreover, the pro-senescent effect of TNF\u03b1 is efficiently counter-regulated by stimulatory cytokines such as GM-CSF.",
