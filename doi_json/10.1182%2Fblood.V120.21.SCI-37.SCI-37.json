    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-37 Studies in mammalian and nonmammalian vertebrate embryos indicate that erythropoiesis comes in two flavors: primitive and definitive. The primitive erythroid lineage in mammalian embryos is characterized by a transient wave of lineage-committed progenitors that emerge from the yolk sac and generate a wave of precursors that synchronously mature in the bloodstream. Primitive erythroid precursors dynamically regulate embryonic globin gene expression and ultimately enucleate to form erythrocytes. Primitive erythropoiesis is superseded by definitive erythroid cells that mature extravascularly in association with macrophage cells. Studies in the mouse embryo indicate that definitive erythropoiesis has two distinct developmental origins. The first is a transient wave of erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMP) that emerge from the yolk sac and seed the early fetal liver. The second is a long-term program of erythropoiesis derived from hematopoietic stem cells. Erythropoietin is the central regulator of definitive erythropoiesis, in part by regulating the survival of committed progenitors. In contrast, the role of erythropoietin in primitive erythropoiesis remains poorly understood. Recent studies indicate that erythropoietin does not regulate the primitive erythroid progenitor compartment, but rather plays a critical role in establishing an antiapoptotic state during the terminal maturation of primitive erythroblasts. EMP-derived proerythroblasts are capable of extensive self-renewal in vitro , while primitive erythroid progenitors are incapable of self-renewal under the same conditions. These studies, taken together, indicate that the primitive and definitive forms of erythropoiesis have fundamental differences in the regulation of red cell output. The overlapping emergence of primitive and definitive erythroid lineages in differentiating embryonic stem cells suggests that the transient yolk-sac-derived primitive and EMP-derived definitive erythroid programs are recapitulated in vitro . These studies offer the hope that human embryonic stem cells can serve as a source of functional definitive erythroid cells for transfusion therapy.
