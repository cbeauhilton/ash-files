It can be induced by inflammatory mediators leading to the formation of monocyte-associated prothrombinase activity, which participates to thrombin generation. This activity appears to be important in both thrombosis (venous and arterial) and in chronic inflammation by inducing the release of inflammatory cytokines. This could be attributed to the activation of PAR-1 and PAR-2 (protease-activated receptors) by factor Xa or by thrombin. In this study, we compared the action of Rivaroxaban and Fondaparinux, two specific factor Xa inhibitors, on the activation of coagulation and on the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in both activated monocytes and activated human monocyte/macrophage cell line THP1. Methods 1-Monocytes were isolated from healthy volunteers and THP-1 cells were used as macrophages. 2- Activation of cells was performed by adding 1 \u03bcg/ml LPS for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C, in the presence of defibrinated human plasma which provides plasma coagulation factors, in the absence (control) or presence of Fondaparinux (500, 1000 and 1500 ng/ml) or Rivaroxaban (150, 250, 350 ng/ml, final concentrations). After incubation, the cells were isolated and their supernatants collected. 3- The procoagulant activity of cells was tested by measuring their effect on the clotting time of normal plasma in presence of calcium. 4- The release of cytokines was tested by antibody-cytokines array in the supernatants (RayBio\u00ae). 5-To test the neutralization of factor Xa bound to monocytes, activated monocytes were incubated with human purified factor Xa (100 ng/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. After isolation of the cells, 250 ng/ml Rivaroxaban or the appropriate solvent was added for 1, 10 and 30 min. The Xa activity associated to monocytes was measured by its amidolytic activity. Results 1- The procoagulant activity of monocytes and macrophages was reduced by Rivaroxaban and not by Fondaparinux . Results of prothrombinase activity in the presence of Rivaroxaban at 150, 250, 350 ng/ml, expressed as percentage of the control value was: 30 \u00b1 3, 16 \u00b1 4 and 12 \u00b1 2 % for monocytes and: 43 \u00b1 2, 24 \u00b13, 15 \u00b1 1 % for THP-1 cells. In contrast, Fondaparinux did not modify the prothrombinase activity of monocytes (105 \u00b1 12%). It was also shown that in the conditions used, Rivaroxaban (250 ng/ml) inhibited completely the amidolytic activity of factor Xa bound to activated monocytes. 2- Both Rivaroxaban and Fondaparinux modify the profile of chemokines secretion by activated monocytes and THP-1. In monocytes and THP-1 cells, LPS induced an important increase in Il-8 and angiogenin and a moderate increase in MIP-1 d (Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-1) and RANTES, a member of the Il-8 superfamily. Both Rivaroxaban and Fondaparinux decreased the secretion of these chemokines to the basal level of secretion by non activated monocytes or THP-1. The secretion of leptin was only induced by LPS- treated THP-1 and was strongly decreased by both FXa inhibitors. In contrast, secretion of EGF (epithelial growth factor) was only induced by activated monocytes and strongly decreased by Rivaroxaban and moderately by Fondaparinux. Discussion and conclusion The results show that 1- Rivaroxaban induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the procoagulant activity of activated monocytes and macrophages, whereas fondaparinux was devoid of this effect . This difference is attributed to a better access of Rivaroxaban to FXa bound to monocytes, as compared to the Fondaparinux-antithrombin complex. This inhibitory effect of Rivaroxaban could contribute to its antithrombotic activity. 2- Rivaroxaban inhibited the secretion of inflammatory chemokines by activated monocytes and THP-1 . This decreased secretion was also observed with Fondaparinux, suggesting that it could be due to the decrease in thrombin generation in plasma, affecting the PAR-1 cell signaling system. As it was reported that that elevated IL-8 is associated with recurrent venous thrombosis and that these inflammatory cytokines are involved in plaque progression and rupture by recruitment of subpopulations of leukocytes and by potent angiogenic activity, this decrease in cytokines could also contribute to the antithrombotic efficacy of Rivaroxaban.
