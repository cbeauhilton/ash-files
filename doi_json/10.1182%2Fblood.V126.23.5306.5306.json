    "abstract_text": "Background The overall survival of patients with multiple myeloma has been improved greatly over the last two decades with the advances of treatment. Several studies reported that this improvement in survival has been ascribed to the broader use of novel drugs and autologous tandem transplantation. However, there were still a certain portion of myeloma patients died early after diagnosis. We therefore aim to investigate the risk factors of early mortality (death within 60 days after diagnosis) in patients with multiple myeloma. Patients and Methods We included in this study 451 consecutive patients with multiple myeloma, newly diagnosed at an Asian tertiary medical center between January 1, 2002 and April 30, 2015. A total 57 subjects who developed early mortality were identified. Risk factors for early mortality in myeloma patients were collected and analyzed. Results Compared with non-early mortality myeloma patients, early mortality patients had higher probability of being male, primary plasma cell leukemia, low platelet count, low serum albumin, high corrected serum calcium, high serum creatinine, high LDH, high serum \u03b22-microglobulin, poor performance status, and high ISS stage. With multivariate analysis, we found that male (adjusted OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.17-7.31), serum albumin < 3.5g/dl (adjusted OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.17-6.52), corrected serum calcium \u2265 12mg/dl (adjusted OR 3.56, 95% CI 1.47-8.63) and LDH \u2265 250U/L (adjusted OR 3.30, 95% CI 1.62-6.74) were significant risk factors of early mortality. Pneumonia represented as the leading cause of early mortality in myeloma patients ( n = 18, 31.5%), followed by renal failure ( n = 7, 12.2%). Conclusion Early mortality rate is high (12.6%) in patients with multiple myeloma. Patients of male gender, low serum albumin, high corrected serum calcium and LDH are at risk of early mortality. More than one third myeloma patients (21 out of 57) who developed early mortality are died of infection. Identifying the risk group and providing prompt intervention, such as prophylaxis antibiotics, may reduce the incidence rate of early mortality and improve the life expectancy of myeloma patients.
