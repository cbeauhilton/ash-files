    "abstract_text": "Abstract 35 As tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) do not induce long-term response in blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-BC) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL), and are unable to kill quiescent Ph + hematopoietic stem cells, alternative therapies targeting dysregulated pathways in BCR-ABL1 + acute leukemias are needed. CRM1, a karyopherin aberrantly overexpressed in several cancers, controls the nuclear export of proteins (e.g. ABL1, SET, p53, p21, FOXO and RB) that regulate normal and malignant hematopoietic cell survival, self-renewal and proliferation. Here we show that enhanced CRM1 expression also occurs in Ph + leukemias and the clinical stage small molecule inhibitor of CRM1, KPT-330, has a detrimental effect on malignant but not normal hematopoietic progenitors. Specifically, a substantial upregulation (\u2265 65% increase) in the expression levels of CRM1 was detected by immunoblot in CD34 + progenitors from bone marrow (BM) of leukemic primary samples (n=3), when compared to CD34 + progenitors from healthy (n=3) donors. Interestingly, CRM1 protein levels in CML CD34 + cells were markedly but not totally reduced by treatment with the ABL1 kinase inhibitor Imatinib (1\u03bcM, 72h), suggesting that BCR-ABL1-driven pathways are not the only factor contributing to CRM1 upregulation. Additionally, treatment of primary CML cells with KPT-330 (1\u03bcM, 72h) resulted in a 75% reduction in BCR-ABL1 kinase activity, consistent with an interrelationship between BCR-ABL1 and CRM1 activities. Finally, the ability of BCR-ABL1 to induce CRM1 expression was demonstrated upon ectopic BCR-ABL1 expression in myeloid 32Dcl3 precursor cells in which CRM1 protein levels became \u223c10-fold higher. To determine the therapeutic relevance of CRM1 inhibition, cell survival was assessed in MACS-purified CD34 + progenitors. Treatment with KPT-330 resulted in \u226580% induction of apoptosis in Ph + (n=5) CML (2\u03bcM, 72hr) and B-ALL (500nM, 72h) CD34 + cells. Conversely, KPT-330 exerted only a minimal effect on the survival of CD34 + progenitors from healthy donor BM (15\u201330% Annexin V positive, KPT-330 0.5\u20132\u03bcM, 72h). Consistent with the existence of BCR-ABL1-independent signaling leading to increased CRM1 expression, marked apoptosis was also observed in KPT-330-treated CD34 + progenitors isolated from a Ph-negative B-ALL patient. Thus, CRM1 inhibitor-based therapies might also benefit BCR-ABL1-negative leukemias. To formally determine the effects of KPT-330 on leukemic cell survival, methylcellulose-based clonogenic assays were performed. KPT-330 treatment (1\u03bcM) resulted in almost total suppression (97% reduction) of the clonogenic potential of leukemic but not normal (30% reduction) CD34 + progenitors. Because of evidence that CRM1 directly interacts with the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor SET, and that CRM1 inhibition alters trafficking of hnRNP A1, a direct regulator of the SET-PP2A interplay in Ph + leukemias, it is conceivable that the anti-leukemic activity of KPT-330 is, at least in part, mediated by PP2A activation. Indeed, KPT-330 treatment (1\u03bcM, 48hr) of BCR-ABL1 + cell lines resulted in full restoration of PP2A activity, comparable to levels observed in BCR-ABL1-negative cells. Accordingly, KPT-330 treatment (1\u03bcM, 12h) of 32Dcl3 BCR-ABL1 cells caused a nuclear accumulation (4-fold increase) and cytoplasmic decrease (95% lower) of SET protein levels, as indicated by both confocal microscopy and immunoblots of subcellular fractions. Moreover, KPT-330-treated cells showed altered hnRNP A1 cellular distribution and overall downregulation. However, unexpectedly, hnRNP A1 protein levels were proportionally higher in the cytoplasm and lower in the nucleus, suggesting that the deleterious effect of CRM1 inhibition on hnRNP A1 might not depend on direct inhibition of hnRNP-A1 nuclear export. Because KPT-330 displays favorable ADME properties and has been shown to alleviate leukemic burden using in vivo models of different cancers, we are currently testing the anti-leukemic activity of this compound in a mouse model of CML-BC. We do expect a profound inhibition of leukemogenesis, and all treated mice are currently alive with no signs of toxicity. Thus, CRM1 inhibition by KPT-330 represents a potential new therapeutic avenue which could easily be exploited in malignancies like CML-BC and Ph + ALL that show a dismal outcome to current available therapies.
