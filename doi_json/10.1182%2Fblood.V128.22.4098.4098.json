    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of Peripheral T-cell lymphomas not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) is currentlybased on an \"exclusion criteria\" model, since PTCL-NOS lack pathognomonic features. Nevertheless, based on gene expression data, Iqbal et al (Blood 2014) have recently identified two different PTCL-NOS subgroups with different biological and prognostic features that accounts for approximately 80% of the cases and have different biological and prognostic features: one characterized by TBX21 overexpression and T-CD8+ molecular profile; the other by GATA3 overexpression and T-CD4+ profile. Herein, we used a wide comprehensive gene expression profiling (GEP) data set in order to further investigate the molecular features of different PTCL-NOS molecular entities. MATHERIAL AND METHODS: A data set were created including samples from 8 main published series (GSE6338, GSE14879, GSE19067, GSE19069, GSE58445 and GSE65823 at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/; E-TABM-702 and E-TABM-783 at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) for a total of 541 patients. R/Bioconductor was used to generate and analyze the gene expression data. We applied the CIBERSORT algorithm (Gentles et al , Nat Gen 2015), which connects specific global expression profiles to the relative prevalence of tissue components (tumour and microenvironment cells). RESULTS : We first re-classified each sample included in the investigated data set based on previously published signatures (Iqbal et al. Blood 2014, Agnelli et al. Blood 2012). This approach led to a final data set of 144 PTCL-NOS (28%), 127 AITL (23%), 69 ALCL Alk neg (12%), 56 ALCL Alk pos (10%), 59 NK (11%) %), together with 86 healthy T-cell tissues. To our knowledge, this is the largest GEP data set ever described in PTCL so far. In the 144 PTCL-NOS cases, two main molecular clusters were extracted based on published signature, replicating previous findings: the first was characterized by both GATA3 expression (GATA3+) and T-CD4+ cell origin; the second by TBX21 expression (TBX21+) and T-CD8+ cell origin. Approximately 30% of all PTCL-NOS were characterized by neither GATA3 (GATA-) nor TBX21 expression (TBX21-), and for this reason they were classified as \"double negative\" PTCL-NOS. Based on data obtained by the CIBERSORT algorithm we found that the contribution of cellular microenvironment components was extremely heterogeneous and variable through the entire PTCL-NOS series. A significant T-CD4+ and T-CD8+ cell enrichment was reported among GATA3+ and TBX21+ groups, respectively. Interestingly, a fraction of GATA3+ PTCL-NOS (n=11, 7.6%) was characterized by a significant \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell component. Conversely, PTCL-NOS GATA3+ patients without \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell component signature were characterized by a low non-T-cell microenvironment component. This may reflect the major tumour infiltration due to higher proliferation rate as suggested by the strong GATA3 correlation with MIB1 and MYC expression (p<0.0001 and p=0.01, respectively). PTCL-NOS TBX21+/GATA3- were mainly divided into two different groups: the first characterized by strong plasma cell enrichment and the second by major macrophage contribution. \"Double-negative\" PTCL-NOS (n=38) were generally characterized by strong T-follicular helper (T-FH) and B-cell signatures contribution. Based on the clinical data available for 105/144 PTCL-NOS, poor overall survival (OS) was associated with GATA3 expression (p=0.03) [3-y OS 26.4% (range 20-32.8%) vs 47.3% (range 40-54.5%)]. However, such a poor outcome was less evident when we limited the clinical evaluation to patients younger than 60 years (40/105). Among low GATA3 expressors, TBX21 expression was associated with better OS compared to other \"double negative\" PTCL-NOS (p=0.07) [3-y OS 66.7% (range 51-82.4%) vs 36.4% (range 22-51%)]. Higher CIBERSORT-predicted T-CD8+ contribution was associated with better OS among patients younger than 60 years (p=0.03) [3-y OS 70% (range 55.6-84.5%) vs 30% (range 21.7-38.3%)]. No other variables or clusters were associated with significant impact on OS. CONCLUSION : Our study based on an innovative computational approach and a large and comprehensive gene expression data set, confirmed the great molecular heterogeneity of PTCL-NOS, suggesting that the current molecular classification of PTCL-NOS may be further improved in the future.
