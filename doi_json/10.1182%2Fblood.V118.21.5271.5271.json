    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5271 Cold agglutinin disease is an autoimmune hemolytic anemia mediated by cold reactive autoantibodies triggering a complement mediated hemolysis. This condition, when not associated with infection, is characterized by clonal proliferation of CD20+ B cells that produce monoclonal IgM cold agglutinins. Conventional therapies for primary cold agglutinin disease (CAD) are ineffective, but case reports suggest that rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, may be effective. In this retrospective single institution study, we evaluated the use of rituximab therapy in 6 patients (pts) [1 male, 5 female; median age 70 years (range 62 \u2013 89)]. Three pts had primary CAD, 2 pts had mixed CAD and warm AIHA, and 2 pts had CAD in the setting of CLL. Five pts had received steroid therapy, 2 pts IVIG, 1 pt azathioprine, and 5 pts PRBC transfusion (2\u201310 units). Five received induction therapy with rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV weekly for four weeks and 1 for seven weeks. Four patients received maintenance rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV every two months (4+ to 12 cycles). All responded to therapy with a median rise in hemoglobin of 1.8 g/dl at 2 months from initiation of induction with further improvement over time (figure 1). Re-induction was performed in 2 pts; both had an initial one year duration of response and both responded following re-treatment. Median duration of response is 3+ yrs (range 1\u20138+ yrs); the 8+ yr response was in pt 2 who received only induction therapy. Two pts have completed two years of maintenance therapy and remain in remission at 4 months and 2 years post, respectively. Cold agglutinin titers decreased by 4 fold in 2 patients, 1 fold in 1 pt and remained stable in 1. Despite the improvement in hgb in all pts, laboratory evidence of low grade hemolysis persisted in 4 pts. All pts were able to be tapered off steroids and all remain transfusion free. No unexpected adverse events were noted. Rituximab appears to be a well tolerated and effective therapy for cold agglutinin disease. The need for and length of maintenance therapy remains to be determined. View large Download slide View large Download slide  Close modal Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
