    "abstract_text": "Background: Pevonedistat is a first-in-class inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of protein neddylation, a critical step in the degradation of cellular proteins that occurs upstream of the proteasome. The combination of azacitidine plus pevonedistat has resulted in high response rates and durable remissions in both myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in secondary AML (s-AML). Preclinical studies suggest that pevonedistat synergizes with venetoclax through neutralization of Mcl-1, providing rationale for the triplet combination of azacitidine, venetoclax and pevonedistat. Methods: In this phase I/II study, adult patients (pts) with newly diagnosed s-AML, including pts with therapy-related AML (t-AML) or AML with MDS-related changes, who were unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy were eligible. Pts were required to have a performance status \u22642, total bilirubin \u2264 upper limit of normal (ULN), ALT/AST \u22642.5 x ULN, and creatinine clearance \u226530 mL/min. In cycle 1, pts received azacitidine 75 mg/m 2 SC/IV on days 1-7, venetoclax on days 1-28, and pevonedistat 20 mg/m 2 IV on days 1, 3 and 5 on a 28-day schedule. Venetoclax dose ranged from 200mg to 400mg daily during the phase I dose escalation. For cycles 2 and beyond, venetoclax was given on days 1-21. Results: Between 3/2019 and 5/2021, 28 pts were treated (3 pts at venetoclax 200mg daily and 25 pts at 400mg daily). Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1 . The median age was 74 years (range, 61-80), and 12 pts (43%) were \u226575 years of age. The study population was enriched with pts with poor-risk features, including 19 pts (68%) with adverse-risk cytogenetics, 14 (50%) with prior hypomethylating (HMA) or chemotherapy exposure for preceding hematologic malignancy, and 8 (29%) with TP53 mutation. The overall response rate (CR+CRi+MLFS) was 71%, and the CR+CRi rate was 64%. Thirteen pts (46%) achieved CR as best response, 5 (18%) achieved CRi, and 2 (7%) achieved MLFS. Among the 18 pts who achieved CR/CRi, 8 (44%) achieved MRD negativity by multiparameter flow cytometry. Responses were observed across subgroups, including in 8/14 pts (57%) with prior HMA/chemotherapy exposure, 6/8 pts (75%) with TP53 mutation, 12/19 pts (63%) with poor-risk cytogenetics, and 8/9 pts (89%) without non-poor-risk cytogenetics. With a median follow-up of 13.4 months (range 0.4 to 26.3+ months), the median overall survival (OS) was 8.2 months, and the median relapse-free survival was 7.5 months ( Figure 1) . The median OS for pts with poor-risk and non-poor cytogenetics was 7.9 and 18.0 months, respectively; for pts with and without prior HMA/chemotherapy exposure was 6.2 and 8.9 months, respectively; and for pts with inv(3) AML, TP53 -mutated AML, and non-inv(3)/non- TP53 -mutated AML was 3.8, 8.9, and 18.0 months, respectively. Four pts (14% of the entire cohort, 20% of responding pts) proceed to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 3 of whom are still alive and 1 with inv(3) who relapsed post-HSCT and died from progressive AML. The combination was overall well-tolerated with myelosuppression as expected with the combination of HMA plus venetoclax in AML. The median number of cycles received was 2 (range, 1-13 cycles). Non-hematologic grade \u22653 adverse events occurring in \u22652 pts included infection or neutropenic fever in 18 pts (61%), hypophosphatemia in 8 pts (29%), hyperglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia and ALT/AST elevation in 3 pts each (11%), and pneumonitis, acute kidney injury, hypokalemia and vomiting in 2 pts each (7%). One pt developed multiorgan failure on cycle 1, day 1 of therapy, with transaminase elevation, hyperbilirubinemia, renal failure and hyperferritinemia; this pt recovered with holding therapy and supportive care. Hypophosphatemia, which has previously been reported with pevonedistat, was easily managed with oral or intravenous phosphorus supplementation. The 4-week and 8-week mortality rates were 7% and 14%, respectively. Conclusions: The combination of azacitidine, venetoclax and pevonedistat was safe and effective in a very poor-risk population of pts with s-AML, half of whom had prior HMA or chemotherapy exposure for antecedent hematologic malignancy. A randomized study evaluating azacitidine and venetoclax \u00b1 pevonedistat (NCT04266795) is ongoing and will help to clarify the potential role of pevonedistat in the frontline treatment of AML.
