    "abstract_text": "Asparaginase (ASNase) is one of the cornerstones of the multi-drug treatment protocol that is used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in pediatric and adult patients. Despite the fact that ASNase has been used in ALL treatment protocols for decades, little is known about the biodistribution and the mechanism of ASNase turnover in vivo. A large inter-individual variation in ASNase pharmacokinetics is observed in patients. While elevated ASNase levels are associated with an increase in adverse events, underexposure, frequently caused by antibody mediated clearance, seriously reduces therapeutic efficacy. To date, it is not possible to predict pharmacokinetics of ASNase in individual patients and therefore current therapeutic protocols are supported by frequent monitoring of ASNase levels and adjustments of administration schemes. We used an in vivo imaging approach to study ASNase biodistribution and pharmacodynamics in a mouse model and provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that identifies the endo-lysosomal protease Cathepsin B in macrophages as a critical component of ASNase degradation. Results/Discussion Mice were injected with 111 Indium-labeled ASNase and biodistribution was monitored by quantitative microSPECT/CT scans and ex vivo analysis of organs using a gamma counter. Over time, ASNase accumulated in the liver and particularly the spleen and the bone marrow. We hypothesized that macrophages in these organs, efficiently take up the ASNase, thereby rapidly clearing the active enzyme from the blood. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of ASNase in cells positive for the murine macrophage marker F4/80. To confirm the importance of macrophage populations in ASNase clearance, we depleted mice from phagocytic cells by injection of clodronate liposomes, and studied ASNase biodistribution and kinetics. Indeed, clodronate pretreatment significantly diminished the accumulation of ASNase in the liver, spleen and the bone marrow while doubling the circulatory half-life of serum ASNase activity. We conclude from these experiments that macrophages determine the pharmacokinetics of asparaginase, which raises the question whether rapid clearance of the drug by bone marrow resident macrophages will negatively affect the depletion of asparagine in the bone marrow niche. We previously linked a germline mutation in the gene encoding endosomal protease Cathepsin B to strongly diminished asparaginase degradation in a pediatric ALL patient. To connect the macrophage mediated clearance to the proposed role of Cathepsin B in ASNase degradation, we studied the contribution of this protease in macrophage-mediated degradation of asparaginase. We used cell lines to show that Cathepsin B expression is induced during differentiation from monocytes towards macrophages. This is consistent with our finding that macrophages, but not monocytes, are capable of degrading ASNase. Furthermore, we used both chemical inhibition and RNAi mediated knockdown of Cathepsin B to show that this protease is required for ASNase degradation in these macrophages. Finally, by comparing Cathepsin B knockout mice with wildtype littermates, we demonstrated that loss of Cathepsin B activity significantly delayed clearance of serum asparaginase, consistent with a prominent role for this lysosomal protease in ASNase turnover. In conclusion, by using in vivo imaging we showed that asparaginase is efficiently cleared from the circulation by macrophages. In particular, bone marrow resident macrophages may provide a protective environment for leukemic cells by effectively removing the therapeutic protein from the bone marrow niche. However, both the prominent role of macrophages and the importance of the lysosomal protease Cathepsin B in asparaginase clearance, may allow the rational design of a next generation asparaginase.
