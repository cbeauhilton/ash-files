    "abstract_text": "Background: Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are the standard of care for patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but their role in those with lower-risk MDS has not been well-established. A randomized phase 2 study evaluating low-dose decitabine and low-dose azacitidine in patients with lower-risk MDS showed that treatment with attenuated dose schedules of HMA therapy are both well-tolerated and effective in patients with lower-risk MDS (Jabbour E, Blood 2017). However, their use as early intervention in transfusion-independent patients with lower-risk MDS remains unknown. Consequently, we performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of transfusion-independent lower-risk MDS patients to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of low-dose HMAs in this patient population. Methods: Fifty-four adult patients with low-risk or intermediate-1-risk disease by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and transfusion-independence at baseline treated on clinical trial NCT01720225 from November 2012 to February 2016 were included in the analysis. Patients were treated with either decitabine 20 mg/m 2 intravenously (IV) daily for 3 days or azacitidine 75 mg/m 2 IV daily for 3 days every 28 days. Dose reductions for grade 3 or 4 toxicities were allowed on the clinical trial, and responding patients were allowed to continue therapy indefinitely. Results: Patient characteristics included a median age of 70 with 38 males (70%) and median bone marrow (BM) blast percentage of 3%. Twelve patients (22%) had low-risk disease and 42 patients (78%) had intermediate-1-risk disease by IPSS, and risk groups by revised IPSS (IPSS-R) included very low-risk in 8 patients (15%), low-risk in 22 patients (41%), intermediate-risk in 12 patients (24%), and high-risk in 11 patients (20%). The most commonly observed mutations were TET2 (26%), RUNX1 (9%), ASXL1 (7%), and TP53 (7%). Thirty-three patients (61%) were treated with decitabine while 21 patients (39%) were treated with azacitidine. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events included pneumonia (4%), syncope (4%), myalgias/joint pains (2%), dizziness (2%), and neutropenia (2%). Otherwise, the most common toxicities were grade 1-2 fatigue (17%), nausea (13%), and constipation (11%). No early mortality was observed during the first 60 days. Of the 54 patients included in the analysis, 50 patients (93%) were evaluable for response based on BM blast percentage and cytopenias. Of the 17 patients with BM blasts > 5%, 11 patients achieved complete remission (CR), 4 patients reached marrow CR, and 2 patients had no response. Of the 33 patients with BM blasts \u2264 5% and at least 1 cytopenia, 13 patients demonstrated hematological improvement, 10 patients exhibited stable disease, 8 patients did not respond, and 2 patients progressed. At a median follow-up of 37 months, the median overall survival was not reached, and the median event-free survival was 24.9 months. Four patients (7%) eventually became transfusion-dependent, and 5 patients (9%) ultimately transformed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Conclusions: Overall, attenuated doses of decitabine and azacitidine were safe and tolerated in patients with transfusion-independent lower-risk MDS. Higher rates and longer durations of response with improved survival and lower rates of AML transformation were observed. Though patients with lower-risk MDS who are transfusion-independent have traditionally undergone surveillance, early intervention with low-dose HMAs may be beneficial in these patients. Prospective studies, such as with clinical trial NCT02269280, are warranted.
