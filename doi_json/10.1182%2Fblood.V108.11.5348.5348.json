    "abstract_text": "Objective: To explore the feasibility of Chinese herbal medicine in haploidentical related allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (Allo-BMT) without T-cell depletion for the treatment of leukemia. Methods: From 2003 to 2005, four patients with CML and four patients with AML received allo-BMT with grafts from 1 or 3 HLA antigen mismatched related donors. All patients were preconditioned with high dose Ara-c, cyclophosphamide (CY)and total body irradiation (TBI) or Busulfan (Bu). Donors were given G-CSF 250\u03bcg/d for seven days prior to marrow harvest. GVHD prevention regimen consisted of CSA, MTX, ATG, MMF and CD25-mab. Chinese herbal medicine was given orally to all patients after transplantation according to the theory (syndrome differentiation) of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). One or 2 weeks after transplantation, TCM were given with the purpose to increase Qi and cultivate Yin, strengthen the function of Spleen and Stomach. At the time of bone marrow convalescence, about 1 month post transplantation, different TCM was prescribed for increasing Qi, cultivating Blood, strengthening the function of Kidney, and fasting distillation. Results: All patients were successfully engrafted. The median days of granulocyte >0.5\u00d710 9 /L and platelet >20\u00d710 9 /L were 12 (10\u201314) and 20(18\u201325) days, respectively. Seven patients developed grade I-IVGVHD, with two of them advanced to grade IV gut and liver GVHD and died of concurrent infection eventually. Two patients developed hemorrhagic cystitis. Six patients were alive in a disease-free situation after median following-up of 20 (6\u201336) months. Conclusion: The major histoincompatibility barriers in the haploidentical related donor/recipient allo-BMT could be successfully carried out with G-CSF stimulated donor bone marrow combined with GVHD preservation and Chinese Herbal Medicine. Our patients were treated with TCM to regulate immunity immediately after clearing out of their bong marrow; With this remedy method, we improved the curative effect of bone marrow transplant and this deserves further study with a well designed clinical trial.",
