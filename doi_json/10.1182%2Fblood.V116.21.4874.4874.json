    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4874 Objective To explore the role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of IRP. Methods Forty-three untreated IRP patients, 34 recovered IRP patients and 13 healthy donors were enrolled in this study. The ratio of IL-23R + CD4 + /CD4 + cells in bone marrow were examined with flow cytometry (FCM). The levels of IL-6, IL-23, IL-17 were measured with ELISA. The expressions of ROR\u03b3t mRNA ASTAT3 mRNA in BMMNC were measured by semiquantitive RT -PCR. Results The ratio of IL-23R + CD4 + /CD4 + cells, the levels of IL-6, IL-23, IL-17 and the expressions of ROR\u03b3t mRNA and STAT3 mRNA in BMMNC of untreated IRP patients were significantly higher than those of recovered IRP patients (p<0.05); there was no significant difference between those of recovered IRP patients and normal controls ( p>0.05) . There were significantly positive correlations between the ratio of IL-23R + CD4 + /CD4 + cells and CD5 + CD19 + /CD19 + ( p <0.05) . There were significantly positive correlations between the levels of IL-17 and CD5 + CD19 + /CD19 + the quantity of BMMNC\u2013antibody ( p<0.05 ); There were significantly positive correlations between the expressions of ROR\u03b3t mRNA and the ratio of CD5 + CD19 + /CD19 + , the quantity of BMMNC-antibody ( p <0.05 ). There were significantly positive correlations between the ratio of IL-23R + CD4 + /CD4 + and the level of IL-17, the expression of STAT3 mRNA ( p<0.05) . Conclusions There exists increased quantity and hyperfunction of Th17 cells in the IRP patients which induce B cells hyperfunction and production of autoantibodies against the BM hematopoietic cells. Th17 cells might be regarded as new therapeutic target of IRP. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
