    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Vitamin D deficiency is common, with 25-50% of the population having levels below the optimal range (<20 ng/mL). Aside from its role in maintaining serum calcium and skeletal homeostasis, vitamin D has been shown to play an important role in regulation of differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, metastatic potential and angiogenesis in a variety of malignancies. Low serum 25(OH)D levels have been associated with a worse prognosis in several malignancies, including colorectal and breast cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Almost no data have been reported on vitamin D levels in light chain (AL) amyloidosis. We therefore measured vitamin D levels among AL patients and correlated levels at presentation to explore if vitamin D deficiency has any effect or association in this disease. Methods : Stored serum samples from 90 patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis were obtained for vitamin D studies, which included 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH) 2 D] and vitamin D binding protein (DBP). All vitamin D measurements were made by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Total 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2 D was assessed as the additive sum of the 25(OH)D2/25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH) 2 D2/1,25(OH) 2 D3 components, respectively. Clinical data was extracted from the electronic medical records. All calculations were made using JMP software (SAS, Cary, NC). Results : All patients were seen between June 2004 and September 2013. Median age was 63 [IQR 57-70]. Heart, kidney, nerve, liver and gastrointestinal amyloidosis was seen in 80%, 60%, 19%, 17% and 13% of patients, respectively. The median dFLC and bone marrow plasma cells were 28 (IQR 12-84) mg/dL and 10% (IQR 5-20%), respectively. The median serum 25(OH)D level was 20 ng/mL (IQR 10-29; normal >20 ng/mL), while the median serum level of 1,25(OH) 2 D was 23 pg/mL (IQR 14-37; normal 16-64 pg/mL for men; 16-78 pg/mL for women). 25(OH)D levels 5 gr/24-h) was strongly associated with low 25(OH)D, (P<0.001, Table). A weaker association was seen between 25(OH)D levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (P=0.06). Seventy-eight percent of patients with 1,25(OH) 2 D levels below 20 pg/mL had renal involvement versus 48% in those with levels above 20 pg/mL (P=0.01). While heavy proteinuria was associated with 1,25(OH) 2 D (P=0.008), the association was stronger for eGFR, as no patient with an eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 had a 1,25(OH) 2 D level above 20 pg/mL (P<0.001). An association between vitamin D levels and low serum albumin was also seen, mainly in relation to 25(OH)D (Table). The median level of serum DBP was 58 \u03bcg/mL (IQR 36 - 120 \u03bcg/mL), significantly lower than the normal range (168-367 \u03bcg/mL). Low levels of 25(OH)D or 1,25(OH) 2 D were not associated with lower DBP levels. Surprisingly, patients with renal involvement had higher levels of DBP versus those without renal involvement (median 70.9 vs 48 \u03bcg/mL; P=0.03), although median levels were below normal in both groups. FISH data was available in 47 of patients (52%). Patients with 25(OH)D levels <20 ng/dL were less likely to harbor t(11;14) versus patients with 25(OH)D levels above this threshold (26% vs 64%, respectively; P=0.0095). A similar, but less significant association was seen between 1,25(OH) 2 D levels at a 20 pg/mL threshold and t(11;14) (35% vs 59%, P=0.09). Other associations between vitamin D and FISH abnormalities were not seen. Conclusions : Hypovitaminosis D is common among AL amyloidosis patients with renal involvement. In the general cohort, heavy proteinuria, reduced eGFR and low serum albumin were all associated with low circulating vitamin D levels. Although the majority of AL patients had low levels of DBP, urinary loss of DBP does not explain the low levels of vitamin D. Hypovitaminosis D is associated with non-t(11;14) disease, a finding which warrants further exploration.
