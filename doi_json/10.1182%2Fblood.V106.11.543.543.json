    "abstract_text": "The NCRI AML14 Trial was devised for patients aged over 60 years with de novo or secondary AML or high risk MDS (defined as >10% blasts). There was a non-intensive option which compared Low Dose Ara-C vs Hydroxyurea each with or without All-Trans Retinoic Acid which has been reported previously ( Burnett et al Blood  2004 : 249a ), and an intensive approach which we now report. This compared two dose levels of Daunorubicin (50mg/m 2 vs 35mg/m 2 ) and Ara-C (200mg/m 2 vs 400mg/m 2 ) within a Daunorubicin/Ara-C (3+10) followed by (3+8) schedule. After a 3 rd course (MidAC: Mitoxantrone/Ara-C), patients were randomised to receive or not a 4 th course (ICE: Idarubicin/Ara-C/Etoposide). In addition some patients (n=200) were randomised to receive PSC-833 in addition to Dauno 35. The results of this randomisation have been reported previously (Burnett et al Blood 2003614a). A total of 1273 patients entered the trial between December 1998 and closure in May 2005, from 136 centres. Follow-up is complete to 1 st April 2005, with median follow-up of 33 months. The median age was 67 (range 44-88). Cytogenetics were known for 67% of patients: of these, 3% had favourable, 74% intermediate and 23% adverse cytogenetics. 72% had de novo AML, 17% had secondary disease and 11% had high risk MDS. The overall CR rate was 62% and the Relapse Risk (RR), Disease Free Survival (DFS), and Overall Survival (OS) were 84%, 13%, and 13% at 5 years. 896 patients were randomised to D50 vs D35. No significant differences were found in CR (63% vs 64% OR 1.04 (95% CI 0.78\u20131.37)), RR (84% vs 85% OR 0.85 (95%CI 0.65\u20131.06)), DFS 14% vs 13% OR 0.86 (95% CI 0.70\u20131.06)), or OS (15% vs 13% OR 0.92, 95% CI (0.72\u20131.08)). Likewise, there were no significant differences in outcome for the 1264 patients randomised to Ara-C 200 vs 400: CR (62% vs 62% OR 1.00 (95% CI 0.80\u20131.27)), RR (84% vs 85% OR 1.14 (95% CI 0.95\u20131.37)), DFS (13% vs13% OR 1.14 (95% CI 0.96\u20131.14)) or OS (13% vs 12% OR 1.00 (95%CI 0.87\u20131.14)). In the 255 patients randomised to a total of 4 vs 3 courses the RR (83% vs 76% OR 0.90 95%CI 0.66\u20131.24), DFS (16% vs 18% OR 0.94 95% CI 0.69\u20131.28) and OS (23% vs 22% OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.75\u20131.47) were not significantly different. From this preliminary analysis we conclude that there is no difference between a reduced dose of Daunorubicin (35mg/m 2 ) compared with standard dose, or between enhanced Ara-C dose (400mg/m 2 ) or standard dose and the confidence intervals are consistent with at most a moderate difference in treatment effect. We found no benefit for giving more than 3 courses of total treatment to patients in this age group, although the confidence intervals here do not rule out moderate, but potentially meaningful differences."
