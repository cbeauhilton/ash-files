    "abstract_text": "Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination is a promising approach to enhance anti-tumor immunity that could be considered for patients with high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We have already shown in human that DC pulsed with eluted peptides (EP) from autologous AML blasts (DC/EP) are able to induce CD4+ and CD8+ anti-leukemic immune response in vitro (Delluc S, Haematologica, 2005). In order to optimize this vaccination strategy for AML patients we developed a pre-clinical murine model. C57/Bl6 mice were vaccinated by DC pulsed or not with peptides eluted from the syngenic C1498 myelomonocytic leukemic cell line in a prophylactic setting. Injection of DC/EP induced an anti-leukemic response as shown by the cytotoxic activity of CD4 T cells, whereas the injection of unpulsed DC induced a NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against C1498 cells. In vivo depletion of CD4 T cells or NK cells abrogated the protective effect induced by DC/EP (p=0.02) or DC (p=0.06) vaccination, respectively, confirming their critical role in preventing leukemic outgrowth. However, late C1498 re-challenge showed that the anti-leukemic immune response was insufficient to protect DC/EP vaccinated mice from death, suggesting an ineffective or absent long-lived memory response. Since several populations of T cells have regulatory properties potentially inhibiting anti-tumor responses, we hypothesized that CD25+ cell-depletion in vivo could enhance the protection induced by vaccination. Indeed, we observed a dramatic improvement of the survival of mice treated by an anti-CD25 antibody before vaccination compared to mice vaccinated by DC/EP alone (p<0.01). More interestingly, CD25 depletion allowed the generation of long-lived immune responses since mice were protected from a late re-challenge by C1498 cells. Our results strongly suggest that depletion of regulatory CD25 T cells before DC-based vaccination should be considered for immunotherapy of weakly immunogenic tumors such as AML.",
