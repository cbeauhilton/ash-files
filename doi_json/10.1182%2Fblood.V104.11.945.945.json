    "abstract_text": "High-dose chemotherapy (HDT) improves the outcome of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) in comparison to conventional chemotherapy. Dose-escalating strategies including tandem HDT are currently evaluated to further improve remission rates and survival of patients. Therefore we conducted a randomized multicenter trial to compare an intensified conditioning regimen with the current standard high-dose melphalan. The primary study endpoint was response rate, with overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and toxicity analysed as secondary endpoints. Between 1997 and 1999 a total of 56 patients with stage II and III disease, who were matched for age (median 56 years), number of previous therapies (median time from diagnosis to transplant 7 months) and different risk factors (beta2-microglobulin, LDH, CRP, cytogentic abnormalities, chemoresistant disease, IgA-subtype, renal impairment), were randomized. All patients received 2 courses of oral idarubicine/dexamethasone and 2 courses of intravenous cyclophosphamide/adriamycine in combination with G-CSF followed by peripheral stem cell collection. Thirty patients were treated with melphalan 200mg/m2 (HD-M) whereas 26 patients received idarubicine 42mg/m2, melphalan 200mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 120mg/kg (HD-IMC) followed by autologous blood stem cell transplantation. Acute toxicity was higher with HD-IMC, including 5 (20%) treatment-related deaths due to infections versus none (0%) in the HD-M group. This lead to early termination of the study. Severity of mucositis (grade III-IV 19 vs. 8 pts., p=0.001), CRP (20 vs. 7 mg/dl, p 200 U/L (p=0.04) and chemoresistant disease (p=0.05) were a bad prognostic factor for EFS. Beta2-Microglobulin levels > 5mg/dl (p=0.01), abnormal conventional cytogenetics (p=0.02) and LDH levels > 200 U/L (p=0.03) were predictive for an inferior OS. In conclusion intensified conditioning for HDT had an intolerable high treatment-related mortality and did not improve EFS and OS in patients with multiple myeloma.",
