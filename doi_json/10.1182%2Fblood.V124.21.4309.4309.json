    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation, differentiation and self-renewal are regulated by signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as c-kit, Flt-3 and Tie2. The functions of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) in counterbalancing RTK signaling in HSCs remain incompletely understood. Among 9 examined RPTPs, we found that PTP-sigma (PTP\u03c3) was significantly overexpressed in mouse and human HSCs compared to more mature hematopoietic cells. PTP\u03c3 -/- mice displayed no difference in mature blood counts or phenotypic HSC frequency compared to PTP\u03c3 +/+ mice. However, competitive transplantation of BM cells from PTP\u03c3 -/- mice resulted in greater than 8-fold increased multilineage hematopoietic repopulation in primary and secondary recipient mice compared to mice transplanted with BM from PTP\u03c3 +/+ mice. While HSCs from PTP\u03c3 -/- mice displayed no differences in cell cycle status or homing capability compared to PTP\u03c3 +/+ mice, PTP\u03c3 -/- HSCs expressed significantly increased levels of activated Rac1, a RhoGTPase which regulates HSC engraftment capacity, compared to PTP\u03c3 +/+ BM cells. PTP\u03c3 -/- BM cells also displayed significantly increased transendothelial migration capacity and cobblestone area forming cells (CAFCs), consistent with increased Rac1 activation. Furthermore, Rac inhibition abrogated the increased migration capacity of PTP\u03c3 -/- BM cells, suggesting that the augmented engraftment capacity of PTP\u03c3 -/- BM cells was mediated via Rac activation. Translationally, we demonstrate that negative selection of human cord blood CD34 + CD38 - CD45RA - Lin - cells for PTP\u03c3 expression yielded a 15-fold enrichment for human long-term repopulating HSCs compared to CD34 + CD38 - CD45RA - Lin - cells or CD34 + CD38 - CD45RA - lin - PTP\u03c3 + cells. These data suggest that PTP\u03c3 regulates HSC repopulating capacity via inhibition of Rac1 and that selection for human PTP\u03c3 - negative HSCs is a translatable strategy to significantly enrich human HSCs for transplantation.
