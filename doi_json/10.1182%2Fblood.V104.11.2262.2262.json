    "abstract_text": "In order to analyse the incidence of iron overload after allo BMT and assess the role of venesection in preventing complications, we retrospectively analysed 168 consecutive patients undergoing allo BMT at our institution from 1998\u20132003 surviving at least one year. Iron studies were performed routinely pre-BMT, at D100, one & two years post BMT. Iron overload was defined by at least one of the following criteria i)liver biopsy (n=24), one of : a) dry weight iron concentration >80\u03bcmol/g; b) iron index >1.9; c) Perl\u2019s stain grade 3 or 4, ii) CT liver iron >1.0mg/ml (n=13) iii) raised ferritin >1000 \u03bcg/L and transferrin saturation >55% on 2 occasions, persisting >6/12 post BMT (n=11), iv) venesection >5g iron (n=1). Using these criteria, iron overload occurred in 49/168 (29%) pts. 12/119 in the non-overloaded group had further investigation but did not meet the criteria; liver biopsy (n=10) or CT (n=2). Elevated ferritin, particularly early post-transplant, did not reliably predict for iron overload, with 55/91 evaluable patients having values >1000\u03bcg/L at D100 not fulfilling the criteria for iron overload. There was no difference between overloaded and non-overloaded patients with respect to age or sex. Acute (15/49 vs. 26/113) or chronic liver GVHD (25/46 vs. 47/105) was not different between the two groups (both p>0.05). Only 3 patients were hepatitis B sAg+ or hepatitis C Ab+. The iron overloaded group was more likely to i) have been transplanted for acute leukaemia (29/49 vs. 33/119; p 0.0002) ii) be C282Y heterozygotes (11/46 vs. 10/110, p 0.02) (iii) been transfused more units of red cells (mean 42 vs. 19; p25 units of red cells. ALT fell significantly (mean pre venesection 189 IU/ml, post 36, p25 units, C282Y heterozygotes) should be closely monitored and early venesection therapy instituted to minimise organ damage.",
