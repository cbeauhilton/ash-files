    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4670 Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) has been used in clinic for the treatment of allograft rejection and autoimmune diseases. However, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. To our knowledge, how ATG therapy affects nai\u0308ve and memory T cells has not been well investigated. In this study, we have employed nonobese diabetic mouse model to investigate how administration of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) affects memory and nai\u0308ve T cells as well as CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in peripheral blood and lymphoid organs; We also investigate how ATG therapy affects antigen-experienced T cells. Kinetic studies of peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells post-ATG therapy shows that both populations decline to their lowest levels at day 3, while CD4+ T cells return to normal levels more rapidly than CD8+ T cells. We find that ATG therapy fails to eliminate antigen-primed T cells, which is consistent with the results that ATG therapy preferentially depletes nai\u0308ve T cells relative to memory T cells. CD4+ T cell responses post-ATG therapy skew to T helper type 2 (Th2) and IL-10-producing T regulatory type 1 (Tr1) cells. Intriguingly, Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are less sensitive to ATG depletion and remain at higher levels following in vivo recovery compared to controls. Of note, the frequency of Foxp3+ Tregs with memory-like immunophenotype is significantly increased in ATG-treated animals, which might play an important role in controlling effector T cells post ATG therapy. In summary, ATG therapy may modulate antigen-specific immune responses through modulation of nai\u0308ve and memory T cell pools and more importantly through driving T cell subsets with regulatory activities. This study provides important data for guiding ATG therapy in allogenieic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and other immune-mediated disorders.
