    "abstract_text": "Fludarabine-refractory CLL has a poor prognosis with a median overall survival time of less than 12 months despite salvage chemotherapy and intravenous alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) is the approved treatment based on a remission rate of 33% and a median survival time of 16 months (Keating et al., Blood 2002). The CLL2H trial of the GCLLSG was initiated to evaluate the subcutaneous application of 3 \u00d7 30 mg alemtuzumab weekly in fludarabine refractory CLL. The current analysis is based on 109 consecutive patients enrolled until completion of the trial in April 2006. Median age was 63 (36\u201381) years, 71% were male. A median number of 3 (1\u20139) prior lines of therapy had been given. Subcutaneous treatment was performed on an outpatient basis in all cases and had to be temporarily interrupted in 68 patients due to neutropenia (43%), anemia (6%), thrombocytopenia (3%), infections (40%, CMV reactivations 30%), and was stopped early in 63 cases due to insufficient response (44%), hematotoxicity (16%), infection (17%), and CMV reactivation (13%). The median alemtuzumab dose given was 722 (3\u20132203) mg. Toxicity was mostly grade I/II apart from hematotoxicity (grade III/IV anemia: 42%, thrombocytopenia: 52%, neutropenia: 54%) and grade III/IV infections (25%). After a median follow up time of 21.4 months, 56 deaths have occurred (due to progression 52%, infections 39%, not CLL related 9%). The overall response rate was 33% (CR 4%, PR 27%), the median progression free survival time was 7.7 months, and median overall survival time was 19.1 months. Genetic high-risk factors were present in the vast majority of cases (unmutated VH 66%, 17p\u201329%, 11q\u201319%, TP53 mutation 39%). Responses (CR or PR) were observed in 22% of VH unmutated, 24% of 11q-, 39% of 17p-, and 33% of TP53 mutated cases. Progression free survival and overall survival were not significantly different when comparing the genetic subgroups, particularly TP53 mutated, 11q-, and 17p- (see figure). In conclusion, subcutaneous alemtuzumab is feasible in an outpatient setting in a high-risk population of fludarabine-refractory CLL and appears to be of similar efficacy as by intravenous administration. Most importantly, genetic high risk subgroups with unmutated VH, 11q- or 17p- appear to respond to alemtuzumab. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure  Close modal",
