    "abstract_text": "Epoetin alfa (EPO) 40,000\u201360,000 U administered SC QW has been shown to significantly reduce transfusion utilization, increase Hb, and improve quality of life in anemic patients (pts) with cancer receiving chemotherapy (CT). The use of higher initiation doses of epoetin alfa followed by less frequent maintenance dosing was evaluated to provide convenience and dosing flexibility for both pts and clinicians. This open-label, multicenter, pilot study investigated the efficacy of EPO at a starting dose of 60,000 U SC QW for 4 weeks (wks) followed by 60,000 U SC administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) for up to 12 wks in anemic (Hb13 g/dL or if increase was >1.3 g/dL in 2 wks, EPO was held until Hb was 1 g/dL) to this initial dosing regimen, which compares favorably with responses seen with a lower starting dose (40,000 U SC QW with dose escalation to 60,000 U SC QW). In addition, pts were able to maintain or extend this response with a 60,000 U SC Q2W dosing regimen thereafter."
