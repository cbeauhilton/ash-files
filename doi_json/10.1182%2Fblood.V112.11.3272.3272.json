    "abstract_text": "We analyzed data from 38 patients (median age = 56, range: 8 \u2013 68 years) with acute leukemia (n=15), chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (n=6), myelodysplastic syndrome with or without myeloproliferative disorder (n=5), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=4), non- Hodgkin lymphoma (n=4), aplastic anemia (n=2), multiple myeloma (n=1) and renal cell carcinoma (n=1), who underwent salvage allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for allograft failure. In 14 cases the original donors were used for second HCT, while in 24 cases different donors were identified (Table 1). Conditioning regimens for first HCTs included total body irradiation (TBI; 2 Gy) with or without fludarabine (Flu; n=28), myeloablative regimens (busulfan-cyclophosphamide, n=6; cyclophosphamide-TBI, n=2); and other, cyclophosphamide-anti-thymocyte globulin-based regimens (n=3). Conditioning for salvage HCT consisted of Flu 30 mg/m 2 /day on days -4 to -2 followed by TBI of 3 (n=24) or 4 (n=14) Gy on day 0. Cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil were used for postgrafting immunosuppression. The median time between first and salvage HCTs was 91 (range, 29 to 1004) days. Sustained second grafts were achieved in 34 patients (89%), while grafts failed in 4 patients (11%), all of whom had idiopathic myelofibrosis. With a median follow-up among surviving patients of 2.0 (range, 0.3 to 7.8) years, the 2 and 4 year Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were 49% (95% CI: 31%, 66%) and 42% (95% CI: 23%, 61%), respectively. The 2 year relapse-rate and non-relapse mortality were 36% (95% CI: 20%, 52%) and 25% (95% CI: 11%, 41%), respectively. The cumulative incidences of grades 2\u20134 acute and moderate-severe chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 2 years were 42% and 41%, respectively. Four patients with chronic GVHD discontinued systemic immunosuppressive therapy at a median of 2.5 years. Within the limitations of the small patient numbers studied, TBI dose (3 vs. 4 Gy), same vs. different donors for salvage HCT, donor type (related, unrelated, HLA-haploidentical related vs. double umbilical cord), and HCT comorbidity scores did not appear to affect outcomes. Based on this retrospective multicenter analysis, we conclude that graft failure following allogeneic HCT can be effectively overcome by second transplantation using conditioning with Flu and low dose TBI (3 or 4 Gy), which should be further investigated in a prospective manner.
