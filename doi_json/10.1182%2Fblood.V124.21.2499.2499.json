    "abstract_text": "To determine the impact of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) recovery on clinical outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and to determine the threshold value of ALC, we conducted a retrospective study of 1109 adult patients who underwent a first allogeneic HSCT from 2003 through 2009, excluding patients who died or relapsed before D30. The median age was 51 years (range: 18-74) with 52% undergoing reduced intensity HSCT and 48% myeloablative intensity HSCT with T-replete PBSC (93.7%) or marrow (6.4%) grafts; 41% receiving HLA-matched related donors, 51% HLA-matched unrelated donors, and 8.5% HLA-mismatched transplantation. The median follow-up time was 6 years (range: 2.5 \u2013 9.8 years). To determine the threshold value, we randomly split the entire cohort into a training set and a validation set in a 1:1 ratio stratified by conditioning intensity, and then applied a restricted cubic spline (RCS) smoothing method to obtain relative hazard estimates of the relationship between ALC at 1 month and log hazard of progression-free survival. Based on this approach, ALC was categorized as low (\u22640.2x 10 9 cells/L) or normal (>0.2x10 9 cells/L). For patients with low ALC at 1, 2, or 3 months after HSCT, excluding relapse or death prior to each time point to rule out the direct influence of relapse on the ALC, the overall survival (OS) (p\u22640.0001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (p\u22640.0002) were significantly lower and non-relapse mortality (p\u22640.002) was significantly higher compared to patients with ALC >0.2x10 9 cells/L at each timepoint, but there was no difference in relapse. Since patients with newly low ALC at 2 or 3 months post HSCT had equally poor outcome as those whose ALC was low at 1 month post HSCT, we combined patients who had low ALC at 1, 2 or 3 months post HSCT and compared their outcome to that of patients who had ALC>0.2x10 9 cells/L at 1, 2, and 3 months after HSCT. The 5-year OS for patients with low ALC was 28% vs 46% for patients without low ALC (p<0.0001); the corresponding 5-year PFS were 21% vs 39%, p<0.0001 and NRM 40% vs 18%, p<0.0001 (Figure A-C). This result was consistent when other prognostic factors, including occurrence of grade II-IV acute GVHD, were adjusted for in multivariable Cox models stratified by conditioning intensity: HR for OS was 1.52 , p\u22640.0001; for PFS, 1.42, p=0.0008; and for NRM, 2.4 p<0.0001 for patients with low ALC within 3 months of HSCT. Low ALC was not significantly associated with relapse (HR 1.01, p=0.92) in the multivariable model. Low ALC early after HSCT is an independent risk factor for increased NRM and poor survival independent of grade II-IV acute GVHD. ALC assessment early after HSCT may be useful to identify high-risk patient cohorts that may benefit from additional therapeutic interventions.
