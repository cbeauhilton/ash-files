    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1226 How transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms control the levels/activities of master developmental regulators has fundamental importance for understanding complex developmental processes such as hematopoiesis and associated pathological disorders. GATA-2 is an essential regulator of hematopoiesis, and GATA-2 mutations characterize heritable disease associated with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, including MonoMAC (syndrome of monocytopendia, B and NK cell lymphopenia, and mycobacterial, fungal and viral infection). However, many questions remain unanswered regarding mechanisms underlying GATA-2 regulation and function. We demonstrated that a MonoMAC patient harbors a 28 bp deletion within GATA2 intron 5 that eliminates a conserved E-box and 5 base pairs of an 8 base pair spacer between the E-box and a conserved GATA motif, which constitutes an E-box-GATA composite element. This composite element resides within the +9.5 kb \u201cGATA switch site\u201d that binds GATA-2 and GATA-1 in the transcriptionally active and repressed states, respectively, and confers hematopoietic and vascular endothelial enhancer activities in transgenic mouse embryos. Importantly, this patient lacked mutations in the GATA2 coding sequence characteristic of other MonoMAC patients, but exhibited prototypical MonoMAC. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the function of the +9.5 composite element, we generated a targeted deletion of the murine element, which yielded embryonic lethality at E13 to E14. Prior to death, +9.5 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit reduced liver size, hemorrhaging, and edema. Nucleated primitive red cells are abundant in the +9.5 \u2212/\u2212 embryos, in contrast to Gata2 knockout mice, which die at approximately E10.5 from anemia due to failure of primitive and definitive hematopoiesis. Furthermore, primitive erythroid (EryP) colony assays conducted with yolk sacs revealed that the mutation does not affect primitive erythroid precursor functionality. However, the +9.5 deletion strongly reduced Gata2 expression at sites of definitive hematopoiesis, including the fetal liver (8.1 fold, P < 0.004) and cultured explants of the hematopoietic stem cell-generating Aortic Gonadal Mesonephric (AGM) region (4.0 fold, P < 0.001). The homozygous mutant animals exhibited a nearly complete loss of hematopoietic stem cells as determined by flow cytometry (20-fold reduction of Lin-Mac1+CD41-CD48-CD150+Sca+Kit+ cells, P < 0.005) and competitive repopulation (complete loss, P < 0.02) assays, as well as progenitors as determined by colony assays (BFU-E, 60-fold reduction, P < 0.002; CFU-GM, 8.8-fold reduction, P < 0.0001; CFU-GEMM, 19-fold reduction, P < 0.001). To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we developed an allele-specific Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE) assay with heterozygous fetal liver cells to test whether the deletion influences Gata2 chromatin accessibility at the +9.5 region. The deletion significantly reduced (8.4 fold reduction, P < 0.001) chromatin accessibility at this region within the mutant allele, while the wild type allele was unaffected. Thus, any potential remaining cis -elements are insufficient to confer chromatin accessibility, supporting a model in which the transcription factors that normally occupy this GATA switch site lose the capacity to access their respective cis -elements in the context of the mutant allele. Our human and murine studies have therefore revealed a cis -element indispensable for the regulation of Gata2 expression in multiple developmental contexts and necessary for the generation of the definitive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell compartment. As additional elements are likely to confer Gata2 expression in distinct contexts, including primitive erythropoiesis, we have implemented a multi-faceted effort to identify such elements and to compare their mechanisms with that of the +9.5 site, which will provide fundamental insights into genetic mechanisms controlling normal and malignant hematopoiesis.
