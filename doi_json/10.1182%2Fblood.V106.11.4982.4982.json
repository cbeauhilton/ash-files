    "abstract_text": "Prognostic factors to predict an aggressive clinical course in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) such as CD38, ZAP-70 and IgH mutation status have been well described, however, readily available presenting features predictive of long-term stability are less well defined. We performed a retrospective analysis of 335 consecutive patients with CLL seen at St. Paul\u2019s Hospital from January 1969 to July 2005. Patients were identified from the practice data-base and clinical and pathological data abstracted by chart review. Long-term stability was defined as no requirement for treatment for at least 6 years (n=66, group A). Characteristics of group A were compared to all other pts (group B, n=269), and, to avoid follow-up bias, to pts followed for \u22656 y who required treatment (group C, n=62). 65 pts in group A were B-cell in phenotype and 1 was T-cell; group B 268 pts B-cell, 1 T-cell; group C all 62 B-cell. Median age at diagnosis for groups A, B and C were 59.5 (range 33\u201380) y; 68 (30\u201394) y; and 60 (30\u201382) y, respectively (p<0.0001 for A vs. B and p<0.42 for A vs. C). Male pts comprised 52%, 54.3% and 53% of groups A, B and C respectively (p<0.85). Rai stages were: stage 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4; 111, 48, 47, 3 and 6 respectively. ECOG Performance Status was 0 in 307 pts and was not analyzed further. Lymphocyte count at diagnosis (LCD) for groups A, B and C were 9 (4\u201350 X 10 9 /L), 10 (3\u2013394) and 12 (3\u2013155; p<0.0001 for A vs. B and p< 0.01 for A vs. C); in group A, 25 (38%) of pts had a LCD \u226410, as did 81 (30%) in group B and 10 (16%) in group C. In groups A, B and C, 9 (13.6%), 21 (11.5%), and 7 (11.3%) pts, respectively, had a lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) \u226412mo (to an absolute value \u226550X10 9 /L; p<0.65). Immunophenotyping was available in 202 pts; 173 were CD5+ CD19+, 2 were CD5- and 29 CD19-. Analysis for CD38 was available in 50 pts; in groups A, B and C, 5 of 36 (14.3%), 2 of 14 (16.7%) and 0 of 7, respectively, were CD38+ (defined as \u226530% of cells; p<0.84). Median follow-up for groups A, B and C was 110.5 (76\u2013369) mo, 43 (0\u2013309) mo, and 134.5 (72\u2013309 mo; p<0.0001 for A vs. B and p<0.67 for A vs. C). Pts in group A did not require treatment by definition; time to treatment (TTT) for group B was median 35 (0\u2013243) mo and group C 66 (0\u2013243) mo (p<0.0001). Median OS for all pts was 191 (0\u2013369) mo. Two deaths occurred in group A; 1 of Richter\u2019s transformation at 77 mo and 1 of unknown causes at 78 mo; median OS for groups B and C was 189 (0\u2013311) mo and 127 (69\u2013311) mo respectively (p<0.025). In group A, 1 pt (1.5%) transformed, as did 15 (5.6%) in group B (8 Richter\u2019s and 7 PLL) and 4 (6%) in group C (1 Richter\u2019s, 3 PLL, p<0.46). At a cutoff in LCD of 10 and 20 the difference in OS between groups was maintained (see Table).  Characteristic . OS @ 120 mo (%) . . . Lymphocyte count at Dx (X10 9 /L) .
