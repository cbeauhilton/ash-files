    "abstract_text": "A new granular smectite hemostatic agent (WoundStat\u2122 [WS]) is capable of producing hemostasis during high pressure arterial bleeding ( Ward et al., J Trauma , 63 : 276 \u2013284, 2007 ). The mechanism by which WS and other topical hemostatic agents help achieve clotting has not been investigated. In this study, the procoagulant and hemo-compatibility functions of WS were assessed using a novel whole blood clotting time assay, and its performance compared to current hemostatic agents QuikClot\u00ae zeolite granules (QC); CELOX\u2122 marine biopolymer hemostatic granules (CX); sterile gauze bandage (SG); and to glass beads (GB). A modified whole blood recalcified clotting time assay was developed using the Actalyke\u00ae Mini II activated clotting time (ACT) analyzer and empty G-ACT tubes devoid of contact phase activating reagents. Whole citrated blood recalcified to 10 mM with CaCl 2 yielded clot times (CT) of 217+/\u22126 sec, 212+/\u221211 sec, and 236+/\u22125 sec, respectively, for three normal donors. Addition of WS resulted in a time and dose-dependent biphasic decrease in CT. At 0.5 mg/ml, WS lowered CT by over 40% to 124+/\u22127 sec, 133+/\u2212 9 sec, and 126+/\u22125 sec, p 50,000 /\u03bcl while platelet counts in WS-treated specimens were similar to untreated controls (214,000/\u03bcl versus 219,000/\u03bcl) and clumped granules, presumably platelet-mediated, were visually apparent in the QC-treated bloods. Blood incubated with CX for up to 45 min also exhibited a drop in platelets from 204,000/\u03bcl to 150,000/\u03bcl. When QC, CX and WS were incubated in blood for 3 hours, corresponding to the maximal times recommended during field application prior to reapplication or surgical debridement, all hemostats resulted in an \u223c 50% reduction in platelet counts from 258,000/\u03bcl to 132,000/\u03bcl; 158,000/\u03bcl and 155,000 /\u03bcl, respectively. In summary, the data suggest that WS is hemocompatible, is moderately capable of inducing in vitro platelet aggregates, and may assist in the arrest of high-pressure arterial bleeding, at least in part by promoting the intrinsic contact phase of blood coagulation. Additional studies are required to further elucidate the potential platelet- and plasma-mediated mechanisms by which WS may help achieve hemostasis during severe arterial traumatic injury.",
