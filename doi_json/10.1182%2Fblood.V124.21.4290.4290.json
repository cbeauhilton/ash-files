    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Survivors of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) hospitalizations have been proposed to be at higher risk for long term poor clinical outcomes and premature death. Patients with TTP have a high risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality as well. However, there is a paucity of data on the predictors of adverse outcomes including death in hospitalized patients with TTP. Methods: A weighted analysis of 5 years (2007-2011) using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a stratified probability sample of 20% of all hospital discharges among community hospitals in the United States (approximately 1100 hospitals/year), was performed. Hospitalizations with TTP as the primary admitting diagnoses were identified using the ICD-9 discharge code 446.6. Univariate and stepwise multivariable logistic regression analyses with elimination were used for statistical analysis. Based on results of univariate analysis, the significant variables were added in a stepwise manner in a multivariable model. All variables selected for the multivariable model were tested for interaction with a significance threshold level of p<0.2. Except for this, all hypothesis testing was two tailed and p<0.05 was considered significant. Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) curve was constructed using risk factors on multivariate analysis. Results: The all-cause mortality rate was 8.7% (918/10615) among admissions with primary diagnosis of TTP (0.5% pediatric, 65.9% female, 58.2% Caucasian, 27.2% African-American). Table 1 lists the risk factors by univariate analysis and includes a) factors with significantly higher odds of mortality and b) other putative factors which were not statistically significant predictors. Table 2: In stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis: arterial thrombosis (adjOR 5.1 95%CI=1.1-31.7), acute myocardial infarction (adjOR 2.8, 95%CI=1.6-4.9), non-occurrence of either intervention: plasmapheresis or fresh frozen plasma infusion (adjOR 2.0, 95% CI=1.4-2.9) 4) requirement of platelet transfusions during hospitalization (adjOR 2.0, 95%CI= 1.3-3.2) and every ten year increase in age (OR 1.4 95%CI=1.3-1.6) were independently predictive of mortality in TTP patients (area under the curve for ROC 74%, Figure 1 ). Conclusion: We present a set of independent risk factors that may potentially be used in a predictive model of mortality in TTP. Early and targeted aggressive therapy based on these factors should guide the management of hospitalized patients with TTP for improved outcomes. Table 1. Unadjusted odds of in-hospital mortality.
