    "abstract_text": "Background: Development of inhibitory antibodies, also known as \"inhibitors,\" to replacement factor is considered the most serious unmet need in hemophilia and occurs in up to 30% of persons with severe hemophilia A, and 3-5% of persons with severe hemophilia B. Once inhibitors are present in high titer, treatment or prevention of bleeding can become more difficult due to the decreased responsiveness to factor concentrates, requiring bypassing agents (BPA) for bleed management. Current BPAs have a short half-life and are sub-optimally effective. Fitusiran is a subcutaneously (SC) administered investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic targeting the endogenous anticoagulant antithrombin (AT) as a means to improve thrombin generation and promote hemostasis in patients with hemophilia. Preliminary data from an ongoing Phase 1, multi-center, study showed that fitusiran was generally well tolerated in patients with hemophilia A or B with and without inhibitors and that administration of once-monthly SC doses of fitusiran led to dose-dependent AT lowering, thrombin generation increase, and decrease in bleeding frequency (Pasi KJ, et al. Haemophilia 2016, 22[Suppl 4]). Here we report the updated safety, pharmacodynamic (PD) effect, and clinical activity of fitusiran in patients with hemophilia with inhibitors as well as long term data from the Phase 1/2 extension study. Methods: We are conducting a multi-center Phase 1, four part (Part A: healthy volunteers; Parts B and C: patients with moderate to severe hemophilia A or B; Part D: patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors) study (NCT02035605) followed by a multi-center Phase 1/2 extension study (NCT02554773). Primary endpoints include safety and tolerability; secondary endpoints include AT activity, thrombin generation and exploratory evaluation of bleed pattern. In Part D, patients with inhibitors received once-monthly SC fixed doses of 50 or 80mg fitusiran. After receiving 3 monthly doses in the Phase 1 study, all patients were eligible to continue monthly dosing in the Phase 1/2 extension study. Utilization of BPA for breakthrough bleed management was permissible in these patients. Results: Part D of the Phase 1 study included 12 hemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors in 2 dosing cohorts (50mg SC, qM dosing cohort, n=6; 80mg SC, qM dosing cohort, n=6). Within the 50mg dosing cohort there were five patients with severe hemophilia A with inhibitors and one patient with severe hemophilia B with inhibitors; mean age: 33 \u00b1 7 years; mean weight: 73 \u00b1 17kg. Previously reported safety data from the 50mg dosing cohort demonstrated fitusiran was generally well tolerated in hemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors and that there were no serious adverse events related to study drug and no thromboembolic events. Monthly administration of fitusiran at the 50mg dose led to a mean maximal AT lowering of 81 \u00b1 2% and mean maximal thrombin generation increase of 368 \u00b1 113%. A preliminary, post-hoc analysis suggested a 49-100% reduction in bleeding frequency at the lower dose of 50mg during initial follow-up in the Phase 1 study. As of July 2016, the 80mg dose cohort has been fully enrolled and includes 6 patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors; mean age: 39 \u00b1 15 years; mean weight: 75 \u00b1 19kg, and 5 of the 6 patients in the initial 50mg cohort have transitioned to the Phase 1/2 extension study. Follow-up in the Phase 1, 80mg cohort and Phase 1/2 extension study is ongoing. Updated safety, tolerability and clinical activity from the Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 extension studies among all 12 patients with inhibitors will be presented. Conclusions: Emerging clinical data suggest that targeting AT is generally safe and could be a promising approach for promoting hemostasis in patients with hemophilia with inhibitors. Furthermore, the potential for low volume SC administration, monthly dosing, and applicability to patients with hemophilia A and B with and without inhibitors make fitusiran a potentially encouraging investigational therapy.
