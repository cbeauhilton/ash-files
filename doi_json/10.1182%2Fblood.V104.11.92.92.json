    "abstract_text": "Mutations in the extracellular portion of the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase (exon 8 mutations) are strongly associated with core binding factor (CBF) - acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the functional role of these mutations has not been elucidated. In 93% of cases, codon Asp419 is deleted and exon 8 mutations were reported to confer an impaired prognosis to patients with CBF-AML. In this study, we are the first to report pro-proliferative and antiapoptotic potential of representative KIT exon 8 mutations in a cell culture model and to show a significant difference to KIT wildtype (KIT-WT). Three representative exon 8 mutants including a single deletion of codon 419 were created by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis. The integrity of all constructs was assessed by complete nucleotide sequencing. After stable expression in IL-3 dependent Ba/F3 cells (confirmed by FACS analysis and immunoblotting), exon 8 KIT mutants were characterized by a hypersensitivity to stem cell factor (SCF) stimulation in terms of proliferation and resistance to apoptotic cell death. The differences to KIT-WT occurred in the physiological range of SCF from 1 to 10ng/ml. The proliferative response caused by stimulation with SCF was reversed in KIT-WT and exon 8 mutants in the presence of Imatinib \u00ae (Novartis) in contrast to the activation loop mutant D816V which could not be inhibited. These biological effects were confirmed by demonstrating increased phosphorylation of the KIT downstream targets mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT after SCF stimulation compared to the KIT-WT receptor. Furthermore, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of SCF induced proliferation in exon 8 mutants. Our data show that KIT exon 8 mutations represent gain-of-function mutations by inducing receptor hypersensitivity to its ligand SCF by activation of MAPK and PI3K and might represent a new molecular target for treatment of CBF leukemias."
