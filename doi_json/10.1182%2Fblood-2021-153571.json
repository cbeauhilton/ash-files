    "abstract_text": "Background: Gilteritinib improves response rates and overall survival (OS) compared with chemotherapy in patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (R/R) FLT3 -mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For older pts with newly diagnosed (ND) FLT3 -mutated AML who are unfit for intensive chemotherapy, azacitidine plus venetoclax is the current standard of care, although remission durations are relatively short, largely due to FLT3 -driven relapses. We therefore sought to evaluate the triplet regimen of azacitidine, venetoclax and gilteritinib for older pts with ND FLT3 -mutated AML, as well as for those of all ages with R/R FLT3 -mutated AML. Methods: In this phase I/II study, pts with either R/R FLT3 -mutated AML or high-risk MDS/CMML or pts with ND FLT3 -mutated AML who were unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy were eligible. FLT3 -ITD and/or TKD mutations were allowed. Pts were required to have a performance status \u22643, total bilirubin \u22642.5 x ULN, ALT/AST \u22643 x ULN, and creatinine clearance \u226530 mL/min. In cycle 1, pts received azacitidine 75 mg/m 2 SC/IV on days 1-7, venetoclax on days 1-28, and gilteritinib on days 1-28. Gilteritinib dose ranged from 80mg to 120mg daily during the phase I dose escalation (3+3 design). Bone marrow was performed on day 14 and if blasts <5% or aplastic marrow, then both venetoclax and gilteritinib were held (ND cohort) or only venetoclax was held (R/R cohort). For cycles 2 and beyond, azacitidine 75 mg/m 2 SC/IV was given for 5-7 days, venetoclax was given for 7-14 days and gilteritinib was given continuously. Results: Between 12/2019 and 7/2021, 26 pts were treated (11 ND pts and 15 R/R pts). Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1 . The median age for the ND and R/R cohorts were 71 years (range, 61-79) and 68 years (range, 19-90), respectively. In the ND cohort, 9 (82%) had a FLT3 -ITD and 2 (18%) had a FLT3 TKD mutation; in the R/R cohort, 7 (47%) had a FLT3 -ITD, 5 (33%) had a FLT3 -TKD, and 3 (20%) had both mutations. Among pts in the R/R cohort, the median number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 1-5), 6 (40%) had poor risk cytogenetics, 5 (33%) had undergone prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), and 5 (33%) had received prior FLT3 inhibitor (including 1 pt who had received prior gilteritinib). Ten R/R pts were treated in the phase I cohort (6 at 80mg of gilteritinib and 4 at 120mg). No DLTs were observed at the 80mg daily dosing. Among 3 pts in the 120mg cohort who were evaluable for DLTs, 1 achieved MLFS but had prolonged grade 4 myelosuppression that met DLT criteria. Due to good clinical activity and superior count recovery observed with the 80mg dosing (with 3 of 6 pts [50%] in the phase I cohort achieving CR/CRp), the 80mg daily dose was chosen as the phase II dose for further study. In the entire R/R cohort, the median number of cycles received was 2 (range, 1-4). The overall response rate (CR+CRi+MLFS) was 67%. One pt (7%) achieved CR as best response, 3 (20%) achieved CRi, and 6 (40%) achieved MLFS. An additional pt with extramedullary-only disease achieved PR. Four pts (27% of the entire R/R cohort, 44% of responding pts) proceeded to HSCT. Among the 10 responding pts, 4 have relapsed (1 of whom was FLT3 negative), 2 died in morphologic remission, and 4 are still alive without relapse. The 30-day and 60-day mortality rates were 0% and 13%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 9.9 months in the R/R cohort, the median duration of response was 9.0 months and the median OS was 10.5 months (Figure 1A) . In the ND cohort, the median number of cycles received was 2 (range, 1-6). All pts responded and all achieved marrow remission by day 14. Eight pts (73%) achieved CR as best response, 1 (9%) achieved CRi, and 2 (18%) achieved MLFS; the 3 pts with CRi/MLFS are still recovering from cycle 1 at the time of this report. Two pts (18%) proceeded to HSCT. With a median follow-up of 3.8 months (range, 0.5-8.7 months), no pts have relapsed and 1 pt died ( Figure 1B) . This pt achieved MRD-negative CR and died 9 weeks into therapy due to sepsis. Conclusions: The combination of azacitidine, venetoclax and gilteritinib was effective in pts with FLT3 -mutated AML. Gilteritinib dosing at 80mg daily was associated with a better safety/efficacy profile and was selected for future study; however, even with this lower dose myelosuppression was common and required attenuation of azacitidine and venetoclax. This combination appears particularly encouraging in the frontline setting where the response rate was 100% with no relapses observed to date.
