    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2719 The aim of this study was to evaluate treatment outcomes and prognostic factors of high-dose MVP (methotrexate, vincristine and procarbazine) chemotherapy and response adapted intensification therapy in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). We evaluated the expression of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded RNA in tissue and pretreatment EBV-DNA in whole blood. Forty patients with PCNSL who treated with high-dose MVP chemotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. Additional radiotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation were performed for the patients who could not achieve complete response (CR) at interim response ( Figure 1 ). The median age was 55 years. CR rate was 50.0% and objective response rate was 80.0%. Two-year overall survival (OS) was 59.8% and 2-year progression free survival (PFS) was 47.1%. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was seen in 19 of 40 (47.5%) patients and thrombocytopenia was developed in 13 (32.5%) patients. Treatment-related mortality was occurred in 4 patients. Delayed neurotoxicity was occurred in 4 patients. Poor performance status, elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein level and whole blood EBV-DNA positivity showed inferior OS ( P =0.036, P =0.022, P =0.013, respectively, Figure 2 ). We detected whole blood EBV-DNA in 10 (29.4%) of 34 patients. It was related with poor OS and PFS in high risk patients according to International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group scores ( P =0.015, P =0.027, respectively). This study suggests that high-dose MVP chemotherapy without intrathecal chemotherapy and response adapted strategy may be an effective regimen for the newly diagnosed PCNSL. Whole blood EBV-DNA positivity could predict the inferior outcome in high-risk patients.
