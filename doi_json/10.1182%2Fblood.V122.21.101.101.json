    "abstract_text": "Overexpression of immune-related genes is widely reported in Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), and chronic immune stimulation increases the risk for developing MDS. We find that TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an innate immune protein, is overexpressed approximately 2-fold in CD34 + cells from 40% of MDS patients, and may explain immune pathway activation in the MDS-initiating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC). In support of these observations and our hypothesis that TRAF6 is important in the pathophysiology of MDS, a gene expression analysis revealed that TRAF6 controls an MDS gene signature in human cells. We, and others, have previously shown that retroviral overexpression of TRAF6 in mouse HSPC results in MDS and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). However, interpretations of these findings are hampered by supra-physiological levels of TRAF6 (>10-fold overexpression) and the stress associated with HSPC transduction/transplantation. To investigate the consequences of TRAF6 overexpression to MDS, we generated a transgenic mouse model overexpressing TRAF6 from a hematopoietic-specific Vav promoter. Expression of TRAF6 in HSPC was approximately 2-fold higher as compared to endogenous TRAF6 and in line with MDS patient CD34 + cells. By 15 months of age, half of Vav -TRAF6 mice succumbed to a hematologic disease resembling MDS associated with bone marrow failure (BMF). In contrast to the retroviral overexpression approach, Vav -TRAF6 mice did not develop AML. Examination of sick mice revealed stage-specific disease evolution. Initially, all Vav -TRAF6 mice exhibit an inversion of myeloid/lymphoid proportions. For Vav -TRAF6 mice that develop a fatal disease, they present with a hypocellular marrow, dysplasic myeloid cells, and neutropenia. A subset of mice also display anemia with nucleated red blood cells, poikilocytosis, and extramedullular erythropoiesis. In support of a BMF phenotype, HSPC from Vav -TRAF6 mice form fewer colonies in methylcellulose. To investigate the consequences of an acute exposure to pathogen, early-stage Vav -TRAF6 mice were treated with a single sublethal dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Unlike wild-type (WT) mice, Vav -TRAF6 mice developed a rapid and reversible anemia, suggesting environmental factors can influence the severity of the disease. To gain insight into the mechanism contributing to BMF, gene expression profiling was performed in WT and Vav -TRAF6 HSPC. One of the enriched pathways consisted of AKT activation and FOXO downregulation. Consistent with the microarray analysis, AKT is constitutively phosphorylated at Thr308 in hematopoietic tissue from Vav -TRAF6 mice. SOD2, a transcriptional target of FoxO3a that is suppressed by activated AKT, is decreased in Vav -TRAF6 HSPC. Given that AKT/FOXO regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells, we investigated ROS levels in HPSC from Vav -TRAF6 and WT mice. Intracellular ROS is significantly elevated in BM cells from Vav -TRAF6 mice, and restored to normal levels when AKT was inhibited. In conclusion, we propose the potential role of TRAF6 in the development of MDS-associated BMF, partly due to constitutive activation of AKT and subsequent ROS elevation in HSPC cells.
