    "abstract_text": "Background. For patients with relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the optimal therapy after arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 )-induced complete remission (CR) is unclear. Autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been advocated. These strategies are associated with morbidity and considerable mortality, and not all patients are eligible. The role of maintenance therapy with As 2 O 3 remains undefined. Materials and methods. From 1997\u20132008, 50 consecutive APL patients (25 men, 25 women, median age: 35 (12\u201372) years) in relapse (R1, n=47; R2, n=3) were treated with As 2 O 3 until CR. This was followed by idarubicin consolidation (6 mg/m 2 /day \u00d7 9) in 43 patients. Seventeen patients did not receive maintenance treatment. Thirty-two patients received oral-As 2 O 3 maintenance (10 mg/day \u00d7 14 every 2 months). All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, 45 mg/m 2 /day) maintenance was used together with oral-As 2 O 3 in 27 patients. As 2 O 3 protocol was approved by the institutional review board at Queen Mary Hospital. All maintenance treatment was given in the outpatient clinic as oral medication. Results. Of 50 relapsed cases, As 2 O 3 -induced CR was achieved in 49 patients, 1 patient dying of pneumonia. At a median follow-up of 61 (6\u2013122) months, 27 patients (19 with and 8 without As 2 O 3 maintenance) had remained in remission. Further relapses (R2, n=20; R3, n=2.) occurred in 22 patients (13 with and 9 without As 2 O 3 maintenance), at a median of 16 (6\u201328) months. Concomitant central nervous system (CNS) relapse occurred in 8 cases. Treatment of post-As 2 O 3 relapses included oral-As 2 O 3 (10 mg/day) + ATRA (45 mg/m 2 /day) with (n=10) or without (n=10) ascorbic acid (1 gm/day) until CR, and then maintenance with As 2 O 3 + ATRA +/\u2212 ascorbic acid. Leucocytosis during treatment was controlled with mitoxantrone. In these 22 cases of post-As 2 O 3 relapses, further remission was still achieved in 19 patients (CR3, n=18; CR4, n=1), with 3 patients dying from cerebral bleeding. At a median follow-up of 88 (8\u201398) months, 8 patients had remained in remission. Further relapses occurred in 11 patients. Salvage therapy consisted of As 2 O 3 +ATRA+ascorbic acid, together with chemotherapy (mitoxantrone, n=8; amascrine, n=3), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (n=4), and autologous HSCT (n=1). Eight patients finally died of refractory leukemia after a median of 6 (2\u201333) months. Three patients had remained in remission (CR4, n=2, CR5 n=1) at a median of 41 (26\u2013102) months. On an intention-totreat basis, our oral-As 2 O 3 treatment/maintenance regimen for patients with relapsed APL resulted in a 4-year overall survival of 71%, and event-free-survival of 53%. Conclusion. Our findings showed that an oral-As 2 O 3 -based treatment/maintenance strategy resulted in durable remission in a significant proportion of patients with relapsed APL. As most of the treatment is administered at home, this regimen involves much less financial, personnel and emotional costs as compared with HSCT strategies. Further improvement should be directed towards prevention of CNS relapses with appropriate prophylaxis in high-risk patients. For remissions at or beyond CR3, consideration of HSC harvest and storage at molecular remission should be considered. The use of demethylation agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors in combination with As 2 O 3 remains to be investigated.",
