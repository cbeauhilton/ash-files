    "abstract_text": "Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) develops in more than half of patients after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) despite poly-pharmacy immunoprophylaxis. Importantly, the dysregulated pathways responsible for this breakthrough disease remain largely unidentified. Thus, the discovery of these pathways represents one of the critical challenges for the field of allo-HCT. To address these needs, we have developed a model of aGVHD in rhesus macaques, which allows us to study the mechanisms of aGVHD both in its untreated state and in a variety of immunoprophylactic settings. Using a systems-based approach, we have created both a multiparameter flow cytometric and transcriptomic map of the immune landscape of aGVHD in allo-HCT recipients, in comparison to two critical control groups: (1) healthy untransplanted controls, and (2) those receiving autologous transplantation. We find that recipients of allo-HCT receiving 1) no immunoprophylaxis 2) monotherapy with CTLA4Ig or 3) monotherapy with sirolimus develop early fulminant aGVHD with multi-organ disease (Figure 1a-grouped as 'Primary GVHD'). The immunophenotype of T cells from the Primary GVHD cohort exhibits an effector/memory phenotype with robust proliferation and acquisition of cytotoxic function. Transcriptomic analysis reveals enrichment of Th1-associated transcripts (IL12RB2, CCR5, CXCR3) as well as programs of proliferation early in the post transplant period (Figure 1b). Flow cytometric data confirms an increase in the number of CD4 and CD8 T cells producing the Th1 cytokine, IFN-g at this time-point (Figure 1c). In contrast, standard-of-care Tacrolimus/Methotrexate (Tac/Mtx) as well as novel CTLA4Ig/sirolimus combination immunoprophylaxis (CoBS) both significantly improved survival of animals after allo-HCT. However, similar to human patients undergoing allo-HCT, these recipients often developed clinical signs of breakthrough aGVHD (starting around day 30 post-transplant) characterized by both gastrointestinal and skin pathology. This cohort was thus termed the \"Breakthrough GVHD\" cohort (Figure 1a). Unexpectedly, despite the presence of breakthrough clinical aGVHD, the Tac/Mtx and CoBS cohorts were still able to control programs of T cell proliferation, effector phenotype acquisition and Th1 cytokine skewing. However, both transcriptional and flow cytometric profiles demonstrated enrichment for molecules that reflect Th17/Th22 skewing (RORC, IL17A, AHR, and IL22) (Figure 2a) and production of IL17a (Figure 2b). These results suggest that while current methods of immunoprophylaxis are able to limit both T cell proliferation and Th1 polarization, breakthrough Th17/Th22 pathway activation occurs despite these therapies. These data suggest that emphasis should be placed on exploration of pharmacologic inhibitors of IL17/IL22 for the prevention/treatment of breakthrough aGVHD.
