    "abstract_text": "Abstract 765 BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are widely used for the treatment of patients with Ph + ALL and CML. To elucidate mechanisms of TKI-resistance in Ph + ALL, we studied gene expression changes of a set of 11 primary cases of Ph + ALL in response to TKI-treatment (16 hours; 2 \u03bcmol/l Imatinib). Sorting genes based on the ratio of gene expression values in the presence vs the absence of TKI-treatment, the BCL6 gene consistently ranked #1 in this analysis. As confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, BCL6 is upregulated by 60- to 90-fold in response to TKI-treatment of Ph + ALL cells. The BCL6 transcription factor functions as a protooncogene in germinal center (GC)-derived B cell lymphomas. We focused our analysis on BCL6, because it functions a transcriptional repressor of p53 and other cell cycle check point regulators and thereby protects GC-derived B cell lymphoma cells from apoptosis. Of note, BCL6 protein levels in TKI-treated Ph + ALL cells were as high as in GC-derived B cell lymphoma. We hypothesize that dramatic upregulation of the BCL6 gene in response to TKI-treatment represents a defense mechanism of Ph + ALL to evade cell death induced by activation of p53 and cell cycle checkpoint regulators. We tested the role of BCL6 in Ph + ALL in a genetic loss-of-function experiment: To this end, B cell precursors from bone marrow of BCL6 +/+ and BCL6 \u2212/\u2212 mice were transformed with BCR-ABL1. Upon treatment with 1 mmol/l Imatinib for three days, viability of BCL6 \u2212/\u2212 BCR-ABL1 ALL cells (0.4% \u00b1 0.2%) was lower by two log orders compared to BCL6 +/+ leukemia cells (46.0% \u00b1 8.2%; p=0.001). Consistent with our hypothesis that p53 and other cell cycle checkpoint regulators are transcriptional targets of BCL6 in Ph + ALL, we observed in a comprehensive gene expression analysis that mRNA levels of p53, p21, Arf and p27 were significantly higher in BCL6 \u2212/\u2212 compared to BCL6 +/+ and BCR-ABL1 ALL cells (confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR). To identify target genes of the BCL6 transcriptional repressor, we performed a ChIP-chip analysis for BCL6 both in Ph + ALL and GC-derived B cell lymphoma. Among the 1,235 target genes of BCL6 in Ph + ALL, 736 were shared targets with GC-derived B cell lymphoma and 499 were exclusive for Ph + ALL. These findings suggest that the function of BCL6 in Ph + ALL does not replicate all aspects of its function in GC-B cell lymphoma. Single locus ChIP analysis confirmed strong recruitment of BCL6 to the promoter regions of the p53, p21 ( CDKN1A ), Arf ( CDKN2A ) and p27 ( CDKN1B ) genes in human Ph + ALL cells after TKI-treatment. In a genetic loss-of-function experiment, we tested whether transcriptional suppression of p53, p21, Arf and p27 represents a major function of BCL6-upregulation in response to TKI-treatment in Ph + ALL. To this end, we measured sensitivity of wildtype and Arf \u2212/\u2212 , p53 \u2212/\u2212 , p21 \u2212/\u2212 and p27 \u2212/\u2212 BCR-ABL1 ALL cells to either Imatinib alone or to a combination of Imatinib and a novel BCL6 peptide inhibitor (RI-BPI). TKI-treatment alone had approximately the same effect in wildtype BCR-ABL1 ALL cells compared to Arf \u2212/\u2212 , p53 \u2212/\u2212 , p21 \u2212/\u2212 and p27 \u2212/\u2212 counterparts. However, when TKI-treatment was combined with BCL6 inhibition (5 \u03bcmol/l RI-BPI), the viability of Arf \u2212/\u2212 , p53 \u2212/\u2212 , p21 \u2212/\u2212 and to lesser degree, p27 \u2212/\u2212 BCR-ABL1 ALL cells was significantly higher than survival of the respective wildtype control leukemia. These findings confirm that transcriptional suppression of Arf, p53 and p21 (to lesser extent p27) represents an important characteristic of BCL6-mediated drug-resistance in response to TKI-treatment. We next tested the potential therapeutic usefulness of concomitant TKI-treatment and BCL6 peptide inhibition: To this end, 2 \u00d7 10 6 BCR-ABL1 ALL cells were luciferase-labeled and injected into sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice. Mice were treated six times between days 7 and 21 after leukemia cell injection with either the BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitor Nilotinib (75 mg/kg) alone or a combination of Nilotinib and RI-BPI (20 mg/kg). Addition of RI-BPI resulted in significantly prolonged median survival (29 days) compared to Nilotinib alone (22 days; 12 mice per group; p=0.004). We conclude that BCL6-mediated transcriptional repression of p53 and other cell cycle checkpoint regulators represents a novel and critical mechanism of drug-resistance in Ph + ALL. Combination of TKI-treatment with BCL6 peptide inhibition represents a new promising approach to target drug-resistance in Ph + ALL. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
