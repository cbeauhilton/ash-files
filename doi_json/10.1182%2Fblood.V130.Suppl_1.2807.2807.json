    "abstract_text": "Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with extremely poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy. Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of PEL. KSHV-encoded viral FLICE-inhibitory protein (vFLIP)-K13 constitutively activates the NF-\u03baB pathway, which has been shown to be essential for the survival and proliferation of PEL cells. In a K13-isogenic cell line based screening of small molecule libraries, we have identified the natural products narciclasine and its structural analog, 7-deoxynarciclasine (found in daffodils), as having preferential cytotoxicity towards K13-expressing isogenic cell line. Further, the structurally closely related lycorine (another alkaloid found in daffodils) also exhibited similar activity. All the three compounds (Narciclasine, 7-deoxynarciclasine, and lycorine) display preferential cytotoxicity against PEL in a panel of cell lines comprising 6 hematological malignancies. Narciclasine is approximately 10 and 100-fold much effective than its structural analogs, 7-deoxynarciclasine, and lycorine, respectively. Importantly, IC 50 of narciclasine in PEL cell lines (\u205310 nM) are well below the physiological concentration that was achieved in murine pharmacokinetic studies (250 nM). Narciclasine arrested cell cycle progression of PEL cells at the G 0 /G 1 phase, with a concomitant decrease in the percentage of cells in S-phase. Further, there is a significant increase in the number of cells in sub-G 0 peak, representative of apoptotic cells, which was confirmed by activation of caspase-3/7, AnnexinV staining, and PARP cleavage. Narciclasine blocked the NF-\u03baB promoter activity in PEL cells as observed by a drastic decrease in firefly luciferase activity of PEL cells stably transduced with a lentiviral NF-\u03baB-Luc reporter. IL-6 and IL-10 are known NF-\u03baB targets and growth factors that are constitutively secreted by PEL, striking decrease in their secretory levels were observed upon treatment with narciclasine. Narciclasine preferentially blocked K13-induced NF-\u03baB over the constitutive NF-\u03baB activity in cells, which were engineered to express K13 conditionally (tet-on inducible lentiviral system). IKK\u03b3/NEMO is essential for K13-induced NF-\u03baB. The preference of narciclasine for K13-induced NF-\u03baB is completely abolished upon NEMO knockout by CRISPR-Cas9 system. While probing the effect of narciclasine on the levels of putative NF-\u03baB target genes by qRT-PCR in PEL, we found that there is a significant decrease in mRNA level of MYC , with a concomitant decrease in its protein level. Subsequently, all the direct target genes of MYC ( MYB, TYRO3, TERT, PMM2, SLC19A1, and HK2 ) were significantly down regulated upon treatment with narciclasine. Furthermore, ectopic expression of MYC from a retroviral promoter significantly diminished the anti-proliferative effect of narciclasine and its analogs in PEL. It has been shown that inhibition of MYC is toxic to PEL and compounds that target MYC display selective activity against PEL, which explains the preferential activity of narciclasine and its analogs in PEL. MYC is required for maintenance of KSHV latency, and its down regulation results in the induction of KSHV Replication and Transcription Activator (RTA/ORF50) in PEL. However, narciclasine neither induced the expression of RTA nor the production of infectious KSHV virions in PEL. Most importantly, narciclasine doubled the survival of NSG mice bearing orthotopic - Cell Line Xenograft (CLX) and Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models of PEL. Finally, the IC 50 of narciclasine in PBMCs from normal healthy donors is approximately 4-fold higher than the PEL cells directly isolated from the mice bearing the PDX model of the disease and PEL cell lines, indicating that there is a significant therapeutic window for narciclasine, which can be exploited for the treatment of KSHV-associated malignancies.
