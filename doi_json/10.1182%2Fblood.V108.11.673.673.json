    "abstract_text": "Maintenance of neutrophil homeostasis in the blood is vital to the proper functioning of the innate immune system. Neutrophil release from the bone marrow is a major regulated determinant of neutrophil homeostasis in the blood, yet the molecular signals that regulate this process are largely unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1), through interaction with its major receptor CXCR4, provides a key retention signal for neutrophils in the bone marrow. Definitive proof of this hypothesis has been hampered by the embryonic lethality of CXCR4 \u2212/ \u2212 mice and the severe engraftment defect observed in recipients of CXCR4 \u2212/ \u2212 fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells. To circumvent this problem, in the present study we generated gene-targeted mice in which CXCR4 was selectively inactivated only in myeloid cells. The mice ( CXCR4 f/\u2212 LysM +/Cre ) expressed Cre-recombinase under the control of the lysozyme-M promoter and contained one CXCR4-null allele while the other was flanked by loxP sites. Myeloid-specific loss of cell-surface CXCR4 expression was documented by flow cytometry. CXCR4 expression in other lineages was documented at levels comparable to controls. Peripheral blood counts in CXCR4 f/\u2212 LysM +/Cre mice were normal except for marked neutrophilia. The absolute neutrophil count was 1.23 \u00b1 0.76 and 8.05 \u00b1 3.00 in wild type ( wt ) and CXCR4 f/\u2212 LysM +/Cre mice, respectively (p <0.001). Of note, no increase in circulating hematopoietic progenitors or immature myeloid cells was observed in the peripheral blood of CXCR4 f/\u2212 LysM +/Cre mice. In addition, no perturbation in B or T lymphocytes was detected. In the bone marrow, the number of Gr-1 + myeloid cells was reduced to 69.2 \u00b1 24.1% of control mice. No accumulation of granulocytic precursors was observed, suggesting that granulocytic differentiation in CXCR4 f/\u2212 LysM +/Cre mice was normal. As a metric for quantifying neutrophil distribution, we calculated the percentage of total body neutrophils in the blood (neutrophil distribution index or NDI) as described previously ( Immunity, Vol. 17, 413\u2013423, 2002 ). Consistent with previous reports, 1.0 \u00b1 0.5% of neutrophils were in the blood of wt mice compared with 9.5 \u00b1 4.2% in CXCR4 f/\u2212 LysM +/Cre mice (p<0.001). Together, these data provide strong genetic evidence supporting the hypothesis that CXCR4 signals are key regulators of neutrophil release from the bone marrow. A broad range of chemokines and cytokines are known to induce neutrophil release from the bone marrow. A recent report ( Blood, Vol. 104, 565 \u2013 571, 2004 ) showed that treatment of neutrophils with KC resulted in heterologous desensitization of CXCR4. Another report ( Blood, Vol. 108, 812 \u2013 820, 2006 ) demonstrated that G-CSF downregulates CXCR4. These observations raise the possibility that disruption of CXCR4 signaling may be a common mechanism by which all mobilizing agents induce neutrophil release. To test this hypothesis, we measured neutrophil mobilization one hour after a single 125 u g/kg injection of G-CSF, a time before any detectable change in SDF-1 expression levels in the bone marrow. Neutrophil numbers increased 1.92 \u00b1 0.16 fold over baseline in wt mice (p<0.05). In contrast, no change was detected in CXCR4 f/\u2212 LysM +/Cre mice (1.05 \u00b1 0.39 fold over baseline, p=ns). These data show that neutrophil mobilization by G-CSF is dependent upon CXCR4. Studies are underway to characterize neutrophil mobilization by other mobilizing agents in CXCR4 f/\u2212 LysM +/Cre mice.",
