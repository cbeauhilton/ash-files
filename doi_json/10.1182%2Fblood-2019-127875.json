    "abstract_text": "Background: Sickle cell disease is a common hemaglopinapthy worldwide and in Oman. Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip causes significant morbidity to patients with sickle cell disease and has a profound impact on their quality of life. This study aims to identify the prevalence and outcome of AVN among young Omani patients with sickle cell disease. Methods: The is a cross sectional study done in the main tertiary care and referral facility in Oman, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital. Out of 3000 registered patients 85 patients found to have clinical and radiological proven AVN, between June 2017-January 2019. Data obtained included demographics, the affected joint, uni or bilateral), radiological staging by FICAT (MRI), hydroxyurea use, dose and duration as well as laboratory data at time of diagnosis. Results: The prevalence of AVN among SCD Omani children and young adults is 2.8 %. Their age ranges between 5-25 (Mean 14.6 +3.4). Male to female ratio was 1.6:1. Based on FICAT system score, most of the cases (82%) are AVN grade 3 and above at diagnosis. Thirty-six patients (42%) were diagnosed to have stage IV AVN. Regarding the hydroxyurea use, 43 patients (50.6%) were already started on HU before the development of AVN. Their mean duration of HU use was 5.3 years, with an average dose of 15.7 mg/kg/day. Fifteen patients developed AVN and were started on HU as part of their management. The follow up MRI of 4 of them showed improvement of their AVN stage (from 4 to 2). Fifteen patients (17.6%) underwent joint replacement because of chronic pain and disability and almost half of them (7 patients) were on hydroxyurea. Conclusion: Prevalence of AVN in young patients with SCD in the main tertiary care referral facility in Oman is 2.8% which is less than the internationally reported. Patients are diagnosed at later stages (3 and above) indicating a possibility of underdiagnosis of asymptomatic stage one and 2 patients. Hydroxyurea use has improved the severity of the AVN in few patients.
