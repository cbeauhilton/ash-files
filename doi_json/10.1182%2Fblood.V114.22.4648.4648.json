    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4648 Objectives A central venous access is always necessary for the management of patients receiving myeloablative conditioning followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Tunnelled, cuffed silastic catheters are the device of choice for these patients. To our knowledge, there are no prospective studies investigating the use of totally implantable central venous access ports (TIAP) in patients receiving myeloablative conditioning followed by allogeneic SCT. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the usefulness of a new \u201chigh flow\u201d single lumen port device in these patients. <>Methods: Between December 2007 and July 2009, patients with haematological malignancies received a TIAP prior to allogeneic SCT. All patients received the same type of port [silicone, 10 French, high flow rate (3100ml/h), Reference 40010, Laboratoires Perouse, Ivry le Temple, France]. All devices were inserted under local anesthesia through direct puncture of the right subclavian vein using the Seldinger technique. A chest X-ray was always obtained to document correct positioning. All infusions, including the graft itself and all blood drawings, were performed via the port. Port-related bloodstream infection was defined according to Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines. All patients were examined by ultrasonography in case of clinical signs of thrombosis and systematically after discharge. Results Forty six TIAP were placed in 46 patients [median age: 25 years (20-41 years); 20 female and 26 male], and remained in place for a cumulative duration of 9756 days in situ (range 30-560 days). No pneumothorax occurred. Port-related bloodstream infection occurred in 2 cases ( candida parapsilosis and staphylococcus aureus ) [2/46, 4.3% ; 0.2 event per 1000 days]. These ports were removed. No port-related thrombosis occurred. No port-related deaths were observed. In conclusion, the use of \u201chigh flow\u201d totally implantable ports has resulted in a good option for long-term access to central veins and delivery of myeloablative conditioning followed by allogeneic SCT, in spite of severe neutropenia and increased risk of sepsis in this category of patients. Although multicentre randomized clinical trials are needed to define the optimal device in this clinical setting, the results of this prospective study support the wider use of TIAP in patients receiving myeloablative conditioning followed by allogeneic SCT.
