    "abstract_text": "Abstract 192 Platelet turnover requires correct glycan presentation and expression. Deficiency in \u03b2-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (\u03b24GalT1), the major enzyme that transfers galactose (Gal) from UDP-Gal to terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to form type-2 lactosaminyl structures, is lethal in embryonic mice. However, E14.5 \u03b24GalT1 \u2212/\u2212 embryos are grossly indistinguishable from wild type embryos. Here we sought to determine whether platelet formation and survival require \u03b24GalT1. Hepatic stem cells were obtained from embryonic livers at E14.5 and megakaryoctes were differentiated in vitro in the presence of thrombopoietin. \u03b24GalT1 \u2212/\u2212 megakaryocytes mature and differentiate normally in vitro as judged by their number, morphology and expression of main surface glycoproteins specific for the megakaryocyte lineage (GPIb\u03b1/\u03b2, GPIX, \u03b1IIb and \u03b23). However, following differentiation, \u03b24GalT1 \u2212/\u2212 megakaryocytes were unable to produce proplatelets and platelets in vitro . Addition of exogenous \u03b24GalT1 and the donor substrate UDP-Galactose did not improve in vitro proplatelet and platelet formation. Importantly, platelet numbers were decreased by \u223c 75% in \u03b24GalT1 \u2212/\u2212 E14.5 embryos when compared to wild type embryos. Platelet size was increased by \u223c 50% in \u03b24GalT1 \u2212/\u2212 embryos, indicating that \u03b24GalT1 \u2212/\u2212 mice have increased platelet clearance and/or that larger platelets are produced in vivo . Our data strongly support the notion that glycosylation mediated by \u03b24GalT1 activity is crucial for platelet production in vitro and in vivo . Our findings demonstrate for the first time a role for posttranslational glycan modification in platelet production. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
