    "abstract_text": "Objective: To establish the xenograft leukemia model with stable multiple drug resistance in nude mice; to investigate the reversal effect of 5-Bromotetrandrine and Magnetic nanoparticle of Fe 3 O 4 combined with DNR in vivo and to search for the possible reversal mechanisms. Methods: K562 and K562/A02 cells were respectively inoculated subcutaneously into back of athymic nude mice (1\u00d710 7 cells/each) to establish the xenograft models. The tumor formation was evaluated by animal ultrasonic inspection. Tumors-bearing nude mice were assigned randomly to five groups which were treated with NS (A group); DNR 1mg/kg (B group); nanoparticle of Fe 3 O 4 combined with DNR 0.63mg/kg(C group): 5-BrTet 2.5mg/kg combined with DNR(D group); 5-Bromotetrandrine 2.5mg/kg and Magnetic nanoparticle of Fe 3 O 4 combined with DNR 0.63mg/kg(E group) respectively. The incidence of tumor formation, growth characteristics, weight and volume of tumor were observed. The histopathologic examination of tumors and organs were detected. For resistant tumors, the protein levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) were detected by Western blot. Results: The tumor incidence was 100% in the nude mice inoculated with either K562 or K562/A02 cells. In 6 to 9 days,the tumors reached a volume of more than 1 00 mm 3 . In vivo, MTT assay showed K562/A02 tumor maintained the drug resistance. For K562 cells xenograft tumors, there were no apparent differences in tumor suppression effect between the B AC AD AE group. For K562/A02 cells xenograft tumors, 5-BrTet and Magnetic nanoparticle of Fe 3 O 4 combined with DNR significantly suppressed growth of tumor: the inhibition rate was 62.76% while DNR alone be used, the inhibition rate was 3.68%. Pathologic examination of resistant tumors showed the tumors necrosis obviously in E group. Application of 5-BrTet and Magnetic nanoparticle of Fe 3 O 4 inhibited the overexpression of P-gp. Conclusion: The xenograft leukemia nude mice model was maintain the multiple drug resistance. 5-Bromotetrandrine and Magnetic nanoparticle of Fe 3 O 4 combined with DNR had a significant tumor-suppressing effect on MDR leukemia cells xenograft model.",
