    "abstract_text": "Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the main regulator of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) self-renewal and survival. Upon binding to its receptor, c-MPL, TPO activates cell signaling through JAK-STAT and other pathways. In recent clinical trials, eltrombopag, a small molecule c-MPL agonist, improved trilineage hematopoiesis in subjects with severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Paradoxically, TPO levels are already markedly elevated in these patients. To explain this paradox, we previously showed that IFN\u03b3, a key proinflammatory cytokine implicated in the destruction of HSPCs in SAA, inhibited TPO signaling in human CD34+ HSPCs cultured in the presence of both cytokines. In contrast, eltrombopag could evade this inhibition in vitro, resulting in improved maintenance of progenitors in clonogenic CFU assays, and long-term repopulating cells in NSG transplantation models compared with TPO-containing cultures (Cheng et al., ASH abstract 2016). In this study, we sought to characterize the mechanisms by which eltrombopag evades IFN\u03b3 blockade of c-MPL signaling. Because activation of both c-MPL and IFN\u03b3 receptor by their respective ligands induces negative regulatory feedback mechanisms from the SOCS family, we first measured expression of SOCS proteins in CD34+ cells exposed to IFN\u03b3 and TPO or eltrombopag. SOCS expression was equally upregulated by TPO and eltrombopag in the presence of IFN\u03b3, suggesting an alternative explanation for eltrombopag's ability to escape IFN\u03b3-induced perturbation of TPO signaling. Because TPO and eltrombopag distinctively bind to the extracellular or juxtamembrane domain of c-MPL, respectively, we hypothesized that IFN\u03b3 may decrease binding affinity of TPO, but not eltrombopag, to c-MPL. We used microscale thermophoresis (MST) to assess the impact of IFN\u03b3 on TPO binding to its receptor. As previously reported, we showed that TPO and c-MPL interact via both a high affinity (K D, app <0.11 \u00b1 0.04 nM) and a low affinity (K D, app =1100 \u00b1 130 nM) binding site. In contrast, IFN\u03b3 had no interaction with c-MPL. Remarkably, addition of 100-molar excess IFN\u03b3 prevented binding of TPO to c-MPL at the low affinity site, but had no impact on the high affinity binding site (K D, app <0.20 \u00b1 0.04 nM) (Panel A). To explain this result, we hypothesized that TPO and IFN\u03b3 may directly interact and form heteromeric complexes that hinder binding to c-MPL, whereas the non-peptide small molecule eltrombopag could conceivably evade that process. Strikingly, MST assays revealed a specific, one-site heterodimeric interaction between TPO and IFN\u03b3 (K D, app =540 \u00b1 30 nM), while no heterodimer formation was observed between either TPO or IFN\u03b3 and other early-acting cytokines (SCF and Flt3L) (Panel B). These data suggest that TPO:IFN\u03b3 heterodimers may be responsible for the hindered TPO:c-MPL low-affinity interaction observed in the presence of IFN\u03b3. To confirm this finding, we investigated whether TPO-induced c-MPL dimerization was interrupted in the presence of IFN\u03b3. Using raster image correlation spectroscopy (RICS) to determine average diffusion coefficients of GFP-tagged c-MPL in live cells, we have preliminarily found that IFN\u03b3 negatively affects c-MPL dimerization in cells cultured with TPO, but not with eltrombopag. Further studies are underway. Taken together, our data provide a new and provocative paradigm to explain the observed negative impact of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN\u03b3 on human HSPC maintenance in bone marrow failure syndromes, and the ability of a small molecule (eltrombopag) to evade this inhibition. We propose that, under chronic inflammatory conditions, IFN\u03b3 specifically heterodimerizes with TPO, resulting in (i) occlusion of the low-affinity binding site of TPO to c-MPL, (ii) impaired receptor dimerization, (iii) perturbation of TPO-induced signaling pathways, and (iv) decreased survival of human HSPCs (Panel C). This new understanding could have far-reaching clinical implications for other disorders of chronic inflammation.
