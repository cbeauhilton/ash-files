    "abstract_text": "Recently, we initiated the first ex vivo HIV-based gene therapy trial in humans with HIV + CD4 + T cells. In this protocol, a modified lentiviral vector carrying an anti-HIV payload is used to modify CD4 + T cells isolated from HIV-infected patients by apheresis and CD8 negative selection. The T cells are activated in the presence of vector and expanded using immobilized CD3/CD28 antibodies, and then infused back into the patient. T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis has value for safety monitoring of adoptive T cell transfers in the detection of aberrant clonal expansions or deletions. In this study, the TCR V\u03b2 repertoire was assessed using a flow cytometry based assay at various time points in the selection/transduction/expansion process of CD4 + T cells. PBMC isolated from whole blood of HIV + patients were CD4-selected using a CD8 negative selection, followed by enrichment by CD3 antibody. CD4 + purified cells were transduced with the lentiviral vector, VRX496, in the presence of retronectin, and then co-cultured with CD3/CD28 coated M450 Dynabeads for ten days. The TCR V\u03b2 repertoire was assessed in throughout the process using a FACS-based assay that employs a panel of 20 monoclonal antibodies recognizing most of the 24 V\u03b2 families in PBMC and CD4+ T cells. Repertoires from subjects with normal polyclonal TCR profiles were conserved, as shown by the absence of any significant change in any V\u03b2 family. Moreover, the transduction/expansion of CD4 + T cells from a patient with a previously skewed TCR profile allowed the improvement of the TCR V\u03b2 repertoire. Finally, no significant difference was observed in the repertoire of cells transduced with VRX496 versus mock-transduced cells. These data demonstrate stability of the repertoire diversity and thus provide important support information in favor of the safety of a gene therapy approach involving lentiviral vector mediated modification and expansion of CD4 + T-cells.",
