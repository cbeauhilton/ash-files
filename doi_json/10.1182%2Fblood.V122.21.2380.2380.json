    "abstract_text": "Background and Objectives In the EINSTEIN PE study rivaroxaban (RX) was found to be as effective as warfarin in the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) with superior safety. However, study results need to be confirmed in unselected PE patients in daily care. Patients and Methods Using prospectively collected data from a large regional registry of patients treated with novel direct oral anticoagulants (NOAC) in the district of Saxony, Germany, we evaluated the rate of recurrent VTE, other cardiovascular complications and bleeding events in patients receiving rivaroxaban for acute PE. In this ongoing registry, a network of 239 physicians enrols up to 2500 daily care NOAC patients who receive central prospective follow up (FU) by the registry office at day 30 day and quarterly thereafter to collect efficacy and safety data. All outcome events are centrally adjudicated using standard scientific definitions. Results Until July 31th 2013, 2249 patients were enrolled. Of these, 72 patients received RX for acute PE treatment (demographic data in table 1 ). Registry patients were older than the EINSTEIN PE population (67.3 vs. 55.8 years), 55.6% were female and 23.6% were treated for a recurrent VTE. During follow-up, unplanned rivaroxaban discontinuation rates were low (around 5%; table 1 ). So far, only one recurrent VTE event occurred (1.7 events per 100 patient years). One patient experienced non-fatal ischaemic stroke within 4 weeks after PE diagnosis (1.7 events per 100 patient years). Bleeding complications were frequent but only 2 major bleeding (non-fatal vaginal bleeds) occurred (3.3 events per 100 patient years). During follow-up three patients died of underlying diseases but none of these deaths were related to VTE or bleeding complications.

Thromboembolic and major bleeding complications are rare and seem to occur predominantly in the early phase of PE treatment.
