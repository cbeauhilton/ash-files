    "abstract_text": "Background Prognosis of relapses is severe in elderly multiple myeloma (MM). In recent studies, median survival at progression after 1 st line therapy was between 9 and 13 months (T. Facon, Lancet 2007; C. Hulin, J Clin Oncol 2009). Bortezomib (V) plus dexamethasone (D) is a major regimen in the treatment of relapses. Bendamustine (B) demonstrated to be highly active in advanced MM. The IFM 2009-01 trial evaluates the combination of B, V and D in elderly patients with progressive MM on or after 1 st line treatment. Methods Phase 2 IFM 2009-01 trial was dedicated to patients older than 65 years in 1 st relapse or refractory to 1 st line therapy. Inclusion criteria were measurable disease, PS ECOG 0-2, ANC > 1.5x10 9 /l, platelets > 100x10 9 /l, serum creatinine level < 250 mcmol/l, AST and ALT < 3xULN. Pts with prior exposure to bortezomib were excluded. Treatment regimen was B 70 mg/m 2 day 1-8, V 1.3 mg/m 2 day 1-8-15-22 and D 20 mg day 1-8-15-22 every 28 days. 6 cycles were administered. Responders were assigned to receive maintenance treatment with 6 additional cycles administered 1 month out of 2. Response was evaluated according to IMWG criteria. Response rate was the primary objective. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicity were secondary end-points. Results From 03/2010 to 07/2011, 73 pts were included. Median age was 75.8 years (range 66-86). Median time from diagnosis to inclusion was 29 months. All pts received only 1 prior line of therapy: Melphalan-Prednisone (MP) in 12, MP-Thalidomide in 42, Lenalidomide-Dexamethasone (LD) in 14, other IMiD-based regimen in 5. Median treatment cycles administered was 7 (1-12). 51 pts (69.8%) achieved at least partial response [best response CR: 10 pts (13.6%), VGPR: 12 pts (16.5%), PR: 29 pts (39.7%), MR: 4 pts (5.5%), SD: 5 pts (6.8%), progression: 12 pts (16.5%), unrelated early death: 1 pt (1.3%)]. Median PFS was 10.8 months (95%CI: 7-18.2 months) and median OS 23 months (15.4-27.5). Adverse prognostic factors for PFS were PS ECOG 2 (p=0.0002), beta 2 microglobulin level > 3.5 mg/l (p=0.0006) and del17p (p=0.01). 26 pts (35.6%) completed the planned 12 cycles of treatment. Cause of treatment discontinuation was progressive MM in 30 pts (41.1%), failure to achieve PR in 5 pts (6.8%), adverse event in 10 pts (13.6%), patient refusal and unknown 1 pt (1.3%) each. 37 pts (50.6%) had died at time of final analysis. Cause of death was MM in 30 pts, sepsis in 5 pts, renal failure in 1 pt and unrelated in 1 pt. Grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia: 14 pts (19.1%), thrombocytopenia: 8 pts (10.9%), sepsis: 14 pts (19.1%), gastro-intestinal: 6 pts (8.2%), anaphylaxis: 2 pt (2.7%). Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 8 pts (10.%) and grade 3 in 3 pts (4.1%). Conclusions In this elderly population with poor prognosis MM, BVD combination provides a high overall response rate and manageable toxicity. These results compare favourably with those achieved with VD or LD. Disclosures: Roussel: CELGENE: Honoraria; JANSSEN: Honoraria. Leleu: CELGENE: Honoraria; JANSSEN: Honoraria.
