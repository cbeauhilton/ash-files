    "abstract_text": "T cells can be genetically modified to target tumor antigens through the expression of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CAR T cells targeting the CD19 antigen is a novel therapeutic approach for patients with relapsed B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). We have previously demonstrated that CAR T cells have a significant clinical benefit in adult patients with relapsed B-ALL. The primary objective of this study (NCT01860937) is to extend the use and test the safety of CD19 specific CAR T cells in a multicenter trial for children and young adults with relapsed CD19 + B-ALL. To date, 24 patients with very high risk (VHR) or relapsed B-ALL have been enrolled on protocol with a median age of 12 years (range 2-20 years) at time of T cell collection. We have treated 9 patients with relapsed B-ALL with a median age 15 years (range 3-22 years) using patient derived T cells expressing a CD19 specific CAR (19-28z). Patients received a dose of 1-3 x 10^6 CAR T cells/kg and complete response (complete remission or complete remission with incomplete count recovery) occurred in 5/9 (55%) patients. Significantly, correlations with response included lower disease burden (as assessed by bone marrow cellularity; p150 vs 20 fold), fractalkine (>20 fold), Flt-3L (>55 fold), IL-5 (>15 fold), IL-6 (>100 fold), and IL-10 (>15 fold) were demonstrated in patients with CRS. Monitoring of bone marrow demonstrated peak 19-28z CAR T cell detection within 1-2 weeks following infusion with gradual contracture over 1-2 months. These early results demonstrate the feasibility and significant clinical impact of this approach in patients with relapsed B-ALL. In an effort to more rapidly generate statistically relevant data, demonstrate the \"exportability\" of this technology between academic institutions, and offer this therapeutic option to a broader number of pediatric patients with chemo-refractory B-ALL we have expanded this trial to include a collaborating institution. The objective of our trial is not to provide an intent-to-treat cohort, but rather demonstrate the tolerability of this technology in patients with relapsed B-ALL. Furthermore, patients meeting disease eligibility were not pre-screened for lymphocyte function prior to collection and/or treatment. Subsequent cohorts of patients will receive 19-28z CAR T cells and will be evaluated for toxicity, persistence of CAR T cells, and for anti-leukemic efficacy.
