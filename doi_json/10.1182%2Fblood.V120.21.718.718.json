    "abstract_text": "Abstract 718 Introduction: In a previously reported phase 2 study of single agent lenalidomide in 25 untreated CLL patients (pts), we reported an overall response rate (ORR) of 56% (14 pts), 40% SD (10 pts) and no CR at a median follow-up of 20.7 months (Chen et al. JCO 2010;29:1175). Although an amended protocol with conservative lenalidomide dosing was used to mitigate tumor lysis and severe myelosuppression observed in the first 2 accrued pts, we continued to observe frequent toxicities of grade 3\u20134 neutropenia (72%) and tumor flare (TF 88%). We now report long-term efficacy and toxicity from this study at a median follow-up of 47 months (mos). Methods: Patients were eligible if previously untreated and symptomatic (cytopenias, symptomatic adenopathy/organomegaly, constitutional symptoms, lymphocyte doubling count <12 mos). The amended starting dose for lenalidomide was 2.5mg daily on days 1\u201321 of a 28 day cycle, with slow monthly dose escalations (2.5mg cycle 1, 5mg cycle 2, 10mg cycle 3 and if required for response, further 5mg increments to a maximum of 25mg daily were allowed). Results: Longterm toxicities: Hematologic toxicities were common: grade 3\u20134 neutropenia (76%), thrombocytopenia (28%), anemia (20%). With longer term use, neutropenia tended to recur (12% of all cycles) and 10 pts required GCSF support (5 routinely during each cycle). Most common non-hematologic toxicities (all grades) were TF (88%), fatigue (76%), rash (60%), muscle cramping (40%), diarrhea (40%). All non-hematologic toxicities were mild (grade 1\u20132), except for 1 pt each with grade 3 rash and diarrhea. Although TF was most common during cycle 1, repeat flare symptoms upon resuming lenalidomide after the 7 day rest period of each cycle were noted in 16% of all 898 cycles administered, and as late as at cycle 28. Infections were mild (most respiratory, skin) with only 2 grade 3 events (disseminated zoster, S.pneumoniae bacteremia). Other malignancies: 2 pts developed transformed large cell lymphoma 7 and 18 mos after study discontinuation, 1 pt developed squamous cell carcinoma of skin at cycle 51, and 1 pt developed recurrence of remote non-small cell lung cancer at cycle 34. Dose modifications/discontinuation: The median highest dose achieved for all 25 pts was 15 mg (range 2.5\u201325 mgs); 8 pts were able to escalate to the maximal 25mg dose. Ten pts (40%) required dose reductions for grade 3 cytopenias [neutropenia (2), thrombocytopenia (2), both (2)], febrile neutropenia (2), and diarrhea (2). Of all 25 pts, the median duration on therapy was 31.1 mos (range 28 days \u2013 60.6 mos). Twelve pts (52%) currently remain on study, receiving a median of 59 cycles of therapy (range 48\u201366). Causes of discontinuation for 13 pts included: treatment-related toxicity (8), lack of response/progressive disease (4), and recurrence of remote lung cancer (1). Toxicities leading to discontinuation included: prolonged cytopenias (3), recurrent infections (1), atrial fibrillation (1), disseminated herpes zoster (1), persistent grade 2 diarrhea (1), and grade 3 skin rash (1). Efficacy: With extended median follow-up from 20.7 to 47 mos, the ORR improved from 56% (14 pts) to 72% (18 pts), with 3 pts in PR upgrading to CR, and 1 SD to PR. Although the median time to response was 7.7 mos, responses occurred as quickly as 1.8 mos to as late as 27.0 mos of therapy. For the 3 CR pts, prolonged therapy with an additional 14.9, 28.3 and 40.6 mos beyond the time of first response was required to achieve CR. To date, 7 pts have progressed with 3-year PFS 68.8% (95% CI:52\u201391%) and OS 85.3% (95% CI:71.1\u2013100%). Correlatives: Cereblon ( CRBN), recently identified as a direct protein target of lenalidomide, was evaluated by gene expression profiling and Western blot and found to be uniformly expressed in all 19 evaluable day 1 pt samples regardless of lenalidomide response. Thus, baseline CRBN expression does not appear to be a useful predictive biomarker of response in this population. The mechanism by which CRBN is linked to response is reported by Trudel et al, ASH 2012. Conclusions: Long-term followup of this study demonstrates that when using low doses of single agent lenalidomide in CLL, prolonged therapy is feasible and may be required for the achievement of durable, high quality responses. Maximal daily doses of 25mg can be reached and may also be needed for optimal response, though recurrent myelosuppression remains limiting.
