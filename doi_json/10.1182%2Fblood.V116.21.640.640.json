The primary objective of the study was to determine the efficacy and safety of ALD518 in patients with advanced NSCLC. Secondary objectives examined hematologic parameters. Methods: 124 patients with NSCLC, ECOG 0\u20133, weight loss in the preceding 3 months of >5% body weight, hemoglobin (Hb) >7g/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) >10mg/L were dosed. Patients were randomized to 1 of 4 groups (n~30/group). Placebo or ALD518 80mg, 160mg, or 320mg was administered intravenously every 8 weeks. Pts were followed up for 24 weeks. Data included hematologic parameters, clinical chemistry, CRP, D-dimer, lean body mass and adverse events (AEs). Quality of life data included the FACIT-F, FACT-L, and FAACT questionnaires. Data presented in this abstract relates to the safety and hematology results. Results: 29 pts completed the study treatments and evaluations, 38 failed to complete every visit, 52 died of progressive disease, and 5 withdrew because of adverse events. There were no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), infusion reactions, or anti-idiotypic antibody responses to ALD518 observed in the study. 84 pts had serious AEs of which 1 was deemed to be possibly related to administration of ALD518 (rectal hemorrhage). The majority of the serious adverse events were due to progression of the NSCLC. Six patients had a CTC grade 4 change in laboratory safety data during the study. Four patients experienced a grade 4 hypercalcemia: 1 (3.6%), 2 (6.1%), and 1 (3.2%) in the ALD518 80mg, 160mg and placebo groups, respectively, and there was 1 patient with grade 4 GGT elevation (placebo) and 1 patient with grade 4 hypokalemia (ALD518 160mg). There were no treatment related differences in vitals sign or 12-lead ECG data.

Conclusions: ALD518 increased Hb, Hct, MCH in NSCLC pts and raised Hb to >= 12g/dL in 58% of pts with a Hb =< 11g/dL at baseline. There was also a modest fall in platelet count observed in patients treated with ALD518 but no patients had a CTC grade 4 thrombocytopenia and only one patient (ALD518 160mg group) had a grade 3 thrombocytopenia at one time point. There were no major safety signals related to the administration of ALD518. Further study of ALD518 as a novel non-erythropoietic stimulating agent for cancer-related anemia is warranted.
