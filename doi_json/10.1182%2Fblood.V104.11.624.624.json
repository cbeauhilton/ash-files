    "abstract_text": "The serine protease, thrombin, is necessary for the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and is a potent activator of platelets. Thrombin-induced platelet activation, as measured by shape change, calcium mobilization, and ATP secretion, requires the protease-activator receptor 4 (PAR4). Platelets isolated from PAR4 knock-out mice are unresponsive to thrombin, and PAR4 null mice appear to be protected from thrombosis in a ferric chloride-induced injury model of thrombosis and a thromboplastin model of pulmonary embolism. To examine further the role of thrombin-induced platelet activation in developing thrombi, we have examined the in vivo kinetics of thrombus formation in living mice lacking PAR4 using high-speed widefield digital microscopy. In this study, platelets were labeled using anti-CD41 Fab fragments conjugated to Alexa-488. Thrombi were generated by laser-induced injury of the cremaster arteriolar vessel wall, and the total fluorescent antibody accumulation was monitored and quantitated for 5 minutes after injury. In PAR4 null mice, the thrombi generated were significantly smaller with an early arrest of thrombus growth when compared to thrombi generated in wild-type mice. The maximum thrombus platelet accumulation in PAR4 null mice (median of 30 thrombi in 3 mice) was 75% less than that seen in wild-type mice (median of 33 thrombi in 4 mice)(P<0.001). The time to half-maximal and the time to maximal thrombus formation in PAR4 null mice is approximately 5.5 seconds and 16 seconds, respectively, compared to 45 seconds and 74 seconds in wild-type mice (P<0.001). The shortened time to maximal platelet accumulation appears to be secondary to an early termination of thrombus growth. Fibrin generation was monitored using Alexa-647 conjugated to an anti-fibrin antibody that does not recognize fibrinogen in mice simultaneously infused with anti-CD41 Fab conjugated to Alexa-488. No difference in total fibrin accumulation was seen during the first 4 minutes of thrombus formation in PAR4 null mice (median of 23 thrombi in 3 mice) compared to thrombi generated in wild-type mice (median of 26 thrombi in 4 mice) despite a significant decrease in platelet accumulation in PAR4 null thrombi. Most of the fibrin deposition in both wild-type and PAR4 null thrombi was observed at the vascular wall/thrombus interface. In summary, thrombin-induced platelet activation via PAR4 is required for normal thrombus growth. However, in this model of thrombosis, neither PAR4 nor maximal thrombus growth appears to be necessary for fibrin deposition. This suggests that a platelet-independent mechanism of thrombin generation may exist. Alternatively, the amount of platelet accumulation and activation in PAR4 null mice may be sufficient for normal thrombin generation and subsequent fibrin deposition.",
