    "abstract_text": "The nuclear interaction partner of ALK (NIPA) is a nuclear protein identified by our group in a screen for NPM-ALK interaction partners. We recently reported that NIPA is an F-box protein that assembles with SKP1, Cul1 and Roc1 to establish a novel SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. The formation of the SCFNIPA complex is regulated by cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of NIPA that restricts SCFNIPA assembly from G1- to late S-phase, thus allowing its substrates to be active from late S-phase throughout mitosis. Proteins involved in cell cycle regulation frequently play a role in DNA damage checkpoints. We therefore sought to determine whether NIPA has a function in the cellular response to genotoxic stress. For this reason we treated NIH/3T3 cells with various DNA-damaging agents. Surprisingly, we observed phosphorylation of NIPA in response to some of these agents, including UV radiation. This phosphorylation was cell cycle phase independent and thus independent of the physiological cell cycle dependent phosphorylation of NIPA. The relevant phosphorylation site is identical to the respective site in the course of cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of NIPA. Thus, phosphorylation of NIPA upon genotoxic stress would inactivate the SCFNIPA complex in a cell cycle independent manner. Interestingly, this phosphorylation site lies within a consensus site of the Chk1/Chk2 checkpoint kinases. These kinases are central to DNA damage checkpoint signaling. Chk1 is activated by ATR in response to blocked replication forks as they occur after treatment with UV. We performed experiments using the ATM/ATR inhibitor caffeine and the Chk1 inhibitor SB218078 to investigate a potential role of Chk1 in NIPA phosphorylation. Indeed, we found both inhibitors to prevent UV-induced phosphorylation of NIPA. Current experiments applying Chk1 knock-out cells will unravel the role of Chk1 in NIPA phosphorylation. Additional experiments were performed to investigate a function for NIPA in DNA-damage induced apoptosis. In this regard, we observed overexpression of NIPA WT to induce apoptosis in response to UV, whereas no proapoptotic effect was seen with the phosphorylation deficient NIPA mutant. Therefore, the phosphorylated form of NIPA may be involved in apoptotic signaling pathways. In summary, we present data suggesting a cell cycle independent function for NIPA. This activity is involved in DNA damage response and may be involved in regulating apoptosis upon genotoxic stress."
