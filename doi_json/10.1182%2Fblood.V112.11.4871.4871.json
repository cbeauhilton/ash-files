    "abstract_text": "The ImageStream technology performs high speed acquisition of brightfield, laser scatter and up to four fluorescent images per cell for several thousands of cells in suspension, thereby enabling simultaneous immunophenotyping and morphology-based measurements. This is the only technology combining cytology and flow cytometry in one single platform. Our aim was to study normal and tumour cells of the haematopoietic lineage with this new technology in order to improve diagnosis of haematological disorders. We have defined cytomorphological criteria of normal bone marrow (n=4) and circulating blood cells (n=40). Cells were multi-colour labelled with both DRAQ5 nuclear stain and CD45 ECD-mAb, and additionally labeled with a combination of mAbs against either CD3/CD19, CD11b/CD16, CD14/CRTH2, or CD71/CD235. Results for normal cells were compared to those obtained by classical cytometry and cytology. We then applied these criteria to samples with patients with circulating leukemic cells, including 1 myelodysplatic syndrome (MDS), 1 myeloproliferative syndrome (MPS), 3 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 2 follicular lymphomas (FL) and 20 chronic lymphocytic lymphomas (CLL). We have created completely new quantitative cytomorphological criteria for classifying blood cells using parameters that measure cellular size and shape, nuclear to cytoplasmic area ratio, nuclear lobe count, SSC texture, the ratio between the size and the major axis of CD45, the ratio between the intensity and the compactness of SSC signal, and the intensity of DRAQ5 labelling, to name a few. Using these criteria, we have characterised normal bone marrow differentiation and normal circulating blood cells. We have obtained a perfect correlation with classical cytology and flow cytometry. Analysis of pathological samples showed that abnormal cells were recognized in all cases. We found an abnormal blast cell compartment and an abnormal monocytic differentiation branch in the case of MDS. We have also defined specific cytomorphological properties that distinguish ALL, FL and CLL tumour cells from normal cells. We also provide data that enumerates the proportion of large cells, of atypical CLL cells and of cells in the G2/M phase. Altogether, these results show that a technology combining cytology and flow cytometry in a single platform leads to the discovery of completely new and quantitative cytomorphological parameters defining each stage of normal cell and each category of abnormal cells of the haematopoietic lineage, opening completely new perspectives for the diagnosis of haematopoietic neoplasms."
