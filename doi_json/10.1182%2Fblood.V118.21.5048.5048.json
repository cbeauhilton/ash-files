Recently, the epigenetic changes have been recognized in the MDS, and some research found that the aberrant DNA methylation had close relationship with the MDS. Meanwhile, some studies showed that the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway and abnormal methylation of the Wnt antagonists had close relationship with hematological malignancies, such as AML AALL Aand CLL, but less is known in MDS. In our research, we studied the methylation status of Wnt antagonists (DKK1, DKK3, HDPR1, WIF-1, SFRP1 and SFRP4) in the patients with MDS and evaluated the role of them in the pathogenesis and progression of MDS, with providing a new theory support for clarifying the complicated pathogenesis and progression of MDS. Methods: The methylation status of Wnt antagonists (DKK1, DKK3, HDPR1, WIF-1, SFRP1 and SFRP4) in pretreatment bone marrow samples from 53 patients with MDS was measured by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). On the other hand, we collected the clinical materials of the patients with MDS and follow up the patients. Then the correlation between methylation and clinical features as well as prognosis of MDS patients was analyzed by\u03c7 2 test and Kaplan-Meier method. Results: In 53 bone marrow samples, the methylation frequencies of the Wnt antagonists were as follows: SFRP4 for 62.3 % (33/53), DKK1 for 45.3 % (24/53), HDPR1 for 34.0 % (18/53), SFRP1 for 15.1 % (8/53), DKK3 for 9.4 % (5/53), and WIF-1 for 5.7 % (3/53). After analyzing individual tumor suppressor gene, clinical parameters and prognostic information, it was found that the patients with the percentage of BM blast above 5% had higher methylation frequency of HDPR1 than the patients with the percentage of BM blast bellow 5% (44.4%\u223ca13.3%, P=0.034); besides, the methylation frequency of HDPR1 exhibited significant differences in the MDS subtypes (P=0.019), and was significantly correlated with the WPSS (P=0.037); In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival curve indicated that the mean overall survival of patients with methylation was significantly shorter than that of patients without HDPR1 methylation (457.3 days vs. 919.6 days, P=0.037) (Fig.1). Conclusion: The methylation of the Wnt antagonists (DKK1, DKK3, HDPR1, WIF-1, SFRP1 and SFRP4) were observed in patients with MDS and their methylation frequencies were different. The aberrant methylation of HDPR1 may play an important role in the progression and prognosis of MDS. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
