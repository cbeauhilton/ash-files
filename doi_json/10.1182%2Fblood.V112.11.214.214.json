    "abstract_text": "Methotrexate is a major component in every treatment protocol for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Both beneficial and detrimental effects of methotrexate in ALL have been clearly related to methotrexate plasma pharmacokinetics, which vary substantially among patients. However the genetic basis of such variability remains largely unknown. Herein, we surveyed 600,000 germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine how inherited genetic variation affects the disposition of methotrexate among 434 children with ALL who received 3014 courses of methotrexate at 2 to 5 g/m 2 . Adjusting for age, race, gender and methotrexate regimen, the most significant SNPs associated with methotrexate clearance were annotated to a plausible gene, the organic anion transporter polypeptide, SLCO1B1. The three top SNPs included rs11045879 (P = 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u221210 ), rs4149081 (P = 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ), and rs2900478 (P = 2.8 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed among these three SLCO1B1 SNPs (r 2 =1) and with a known functional polymorphism in SLCO1B1, T521C (rs4149056, r 2 = 0.86). The top two SLCO1B1 SNPs rs11045879 and rs4149081 were further validated (P = 0.018 and P = 0.017) in an independent cohort of 206 patients with ALL. Additional SNPs annotated to SLCO1B1 were identified and further validated. In a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, SLCO1B1 genetic variation remained significant and explained clearance variability comparable to that of other non-genetic factors including treatment regimen. SNPs in SLCO1B1 were also associated with methotrexate-related gastrointestinal toxicity (P= 0.03 to 0.0005, odds ratio 8.3 to 16.4). In summary, we have identified a candidate gene, SLCO1B1, which is strongly associated with the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate, an anticancer drug with a low therapeutic index in multiple treatment regimens. Although SLCO1B1 is widely recognized as having a strong impact on the disposition of many drugs in clinical use, based on in vitro data, it was not thought to have a major role in methotrexate transport or disposition. Our study demonstrates proof of principle that genome-wide tools in clinical pharmacologic problems can lead to the discovery of important and novel pharmacogenetic links between inherited genomic variation and drug response in humans.",
