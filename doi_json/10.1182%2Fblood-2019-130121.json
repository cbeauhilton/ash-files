    "abstract_text": "Antibody-based immunotherapy represents a promising strategy to target chemo-resistant leukemic cells. However, current antibody-based approaches are restricted to cell lineage surface antigens. Targeting intracellular antigens enables to enlarge the number of suitable tumor-associated target antigens with a more restricted expression profile. In this study we evaluated a 2+1 T Cell Bispecific (TCB) antibody for immunotherapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The T cell receptor (TCR)-like TCB targets the intracellular tumor antigen Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) by bivalent recognition of the peptide RMFPNAPYL in the context of human leukocyte antigen allele A*02 (HLA-A2). Complementary binding to CD3\u03b5 recruits T cells irrespective of their TCR-specificity. We further analyzed enhancement of TCB-mediated T cell cytotoxicity through combination with the immune-modulatory drug lenalidomide. WT1 expression levels in cancer cell lines and primary AML patient samples at different time points during course of the disease were determined by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemical staining. WT1-TCB-mediated cytotoxicity was analyzed by co-cultivation of WT1-expressing HLA-A2 + cancer cell lines with T cells from healthy donors. Specific lysis was assessed by flow cytometry. TCR downstream signaling was measured by co-cultivation of primary AML cells with NFAT Luciferase Reporter Jurkat cells. WT1-TCB-mediated cytotoxicity against primary AML cells and combination with 10 \u03bcM lenalidomide was evaluated in our pre-established feeder layer-based ex vivo long-term culture system. For in vivo testing, NSG mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid-Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) were humanized with human HLA-A2 + CD34 + cord blood cells. After successful engraftment and development of human T cells, WT1-expressing HLA-A2 + SKM-1 tumor cells were subcutaneously inoculated followed by weekly administration of the WT1-TCB. In accordance with previous reports, we observed WT1 expression in 79% (n=38) of cancer cell lines and in 92% (n=65) of AML patient samples at the time of initial diagnosis. Moreover, WT1 expression levels correlated with the percentage of AML blasts: no significant WT1 expression was observed at time of CR (n=26), whereas WT1 was expressed again at time of relapse (n=21). WT1-TCBs elicited antibody-mediated T cell cytotoxicity against peptide-pulsed T2 cells and AML cell lines in a WT1 and HLA-restricted manner. Equally, TCR downstream signaling was observed in a WT1-restrictive manner by co-cultivation of primary AML cells with NFAT Luciferase Reporter Jurkat cells. WT1-TCBs further mediated specific lysis of primary AML cells upon addition of allogenic T cells from healthy donors (mean specific lysis: 67\u00b16% after 13-14 days; \u00b1SEM; n=18). Correspondingly, up-regulation of T cell activation and surrogate exhaustion markers was observed (MFI fold change CD69: 9.3\u00b11.5, PD-1: 5.1\u00b10.7, TIM-3: 4.7\u00b10.6; \u00b1SEM; n=22). WT1-TCBs also mediated killing of primary AML cells in an autologous setting (mean specific lysis: 38\u00b113% after 13-14 days; \u00b1SEM; n=5). In comparison with WT1 RMF -specific T cells, only bivalent binding by WT1-TCB induced efficient lysis of primary AML cells. Interestingly, combination of WT1-TCB with lenalidomide further enhanced antibody-mediated T-cell cytotoxicity against primary AML cells (mean specific lysis on day 3-4: 32\u00b110% vs 59\u00b19%; p=0.0017; \u00b1SEM; n=13). This was accompanied by an increased secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-2, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 and promoted the differentiation of na\u00efve T cells towards a memory phenotype characterized by a downregulation of CD45RA. Furthermore, WT1-TCB-treated humanized mice bearing SKM-1 tumors showed a dose dependent and significant reduction in tumor growth resulting in tumor control. TCR-like TCBs targeting intracellular tumor antigens are a promising tool for cancer immunotherapy. Notably, the 2+1 TCB molecular format for bivalent binding facilitates potent in vitro , ex vivo and in vivo killing of AML cell lines and primary AML samples which present low numbers of the RMF peptide-MHC complex on the cell surface validating WT1-TCB as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of AML. Our results further indicate that the combinatorial approach with lenalidomide leads to increased TCB-mediated T cell cytotoxicity.
