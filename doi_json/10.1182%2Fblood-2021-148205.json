    "abstract_text": "Splicing factors (SFs) are among the most frequent mutational targets in myeloid neoplasms, particularly in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), designated as chromatin/spliceosome-mutated AML, where major SFs mutated include SF3B1 , SRSF2 , U2AF1 , and ZRSR2 . SF mutations are largely mutually exclusive and except for ZRSR2 mutations, heterozygous, suggesting synthetic lethality of homozygous or multiple mutations. Thus, SF functions might be a plausible target of therapy for MDS/AML. Of potential interest in this regard is serine/arginine-rich (SR) domains ubiquitously shared by many SFs, including U2AF1, SRSF2, and ZRSR2, which need to be phosphorylated for their nuclear translocation by evolutionally conserved kinases, known as CLK family of proteins. CLK family kinases regulate mRNA splicing by phosphorylating various SR proteins, and inhibition of CLK family kinases resulted in reduction of phosphorylation levels of SR proteins, induction of splicing alterations and protein depletion for multiple genes. In addition, a recent report showed that CLK inhibition can induce skipped exons, cell death, and cell growth suppression. Thus, CLK inhibitors might have a role in the therapeutics of SF-mutated MDS/AML, by further compromising RNA splicing. We have recently developed an orally available and highly potent CLK inhibitor, CTX-712, and evaluated its anti-leukemic activities both in vitro and in vivo . When tested in human myeloid cell lines (K562 and MV-4-11), CTX-712 showed a strong inhibitory effect on cell proliferation (IC 50 =0.15 and 0.036 \u03bcM, respectively). The anti-leukemic effect was also confirmed by survival assay using a total of 79 primary AML cells (the average of IC 50 was 0.078 \u03bcM). In addition, CTX-712 suppressed phosphorylation of multiple SR proteins including SRSF3/4/6, all of which bind to SRSF2. RNA-seq analysis revealed that CTX-712 induced global splicing changes, which typically resulted in skipped exon. Notably, the degree of splicing (percent spliced-in value) in skipped exon events induced by the drug was positively correlated with the sensitivity to the drug (IC 50 ) in primary AML cells (n=32, R =0.61, P =0.00018). To further investigate the effect of CTX-712 on tumor growth in vivo , we established 13 MDS/AML-derived xenografts (PDXs), which were treated with varying doses of CTX-712. Among the 13 PDX models, SRSF2 mutation was found in 2 cases, which had the SRSF2 P95H or P95L mutation. The SRSF2 P95H PDX showed a significant response to CTX-712 in a dose-dependent manner. Of note, 4 out of 5 mice treated using a high dose protocol (12.5 mg/kg) achieved complete remission (the tumor shrank completely to unmeasurable size). Two weeks after treatment, tumor volumes (mm 3 ) were 762 \u00b1 147 (vehicle), 331 \u00b1 64 (low dose of CTX-712: 6.25mg/kg, P =0.0395), and 39 \u00b1 39 (high dose, P =0.0064) (N=5 each, mean \u00b1 SEM). Interestingly CLK inhibition induced aberrant splicing events including skipped exons in vivo , which were more strongly affected in the SRSF2 -mutated model. In addition, CTX-712 efficacy was also confirmed in the model with the SRSF2 P95L mutation. The SRSF2 P95L model showed a significant reduction in tumor volumes (mm 3 ) 2 weeks after CTX-712 treatment; 406 \u00b1 94 (vehicle) and 75 \u00b1 17 (high dose, P =0.0162) (N=6 each, mean \u00b1 SEM). CTX-712 also significantly improved the survival of the SRSF2 P95L-mutated model (high dose, P =0.0030) (N=6 each). Overall, 10 out of 13 PDX AML/MDS models, including 2 SRSF2 -mutated models, showed anti-tumor effect of CTX-712. Complete disappearances of tumors were obtained in the SRSF2 P95H mutation model. These results provide mechanistic insights of CLK inhibition and a rationale for further investigation of the novel CLK inhibitor in MDS/AML.
