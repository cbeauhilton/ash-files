    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Despite recent advances, MM remains incurable and new therapeutic options are needed, particularly for pts with RRMM. IBER is a novel, potent oral cereblon E3 ligase modulator (CELMoD \u00ae ) compound with enhanced tumoricidal and immune-stimulatory effects compared with immunomodulatory (IMiD \u00ae ) agents. Preclinically, IBER demonstrated marked synergy with DEX and with other standard myeloma treatments. CC-220-MM-001 (NCT02773030) is an ongoing phase 1/2 study evaluating IBER with different treatment combinations in independent cohorts of pts with RRMM; in phase 1, the recommended phase 2 dose of IBER, when given in combination with DEX, was determined at 1.6 mg (Lonial S, et al. Blood 2019;134[suppl 1]:3119). Here we report results from the dose expansion of IBER + DEX in pts with heavily pretreated, triple-class exposed (including \u2265 1 IMiD agent, \u2265 1 proteasome inhibitor [PI], and \u2265 1 anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody [mAb]) RRMM. Methods : Eligible pts had RRMM; had received \u2265 3 prior lines of therapy, including lenalidomide (LEN), pomalidomide (POM), a PI, a glucocorticoid, and an anti-CD38 mAb; had experienced disease progression within 60 days of last myeloma therapy; and were refractory to an IMiD agent, a PI, a glucocorticoid, and an anti-CD38 mAb. Pts with central nervous system involvement were not eligible. Pts who had received prior anti-BCMA therapy were excluded, but included in a supportive cohort for safety and preliminary efficacy assessment. IBER (1.6 mg) was given orally on days (D) 1-21, in combination with DEX (40 mg; 20 mg if > 75 years of age) on D1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle. Thrombo-embolism prophylaxis was mandatory for all pts. Primary objective was to determine efficacy expressed as overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included additional efficacy and safety assessments. Exploratory endpoints included evaluation of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Results : As of June 2, 2021, 107 pts had received IBER + DEX. Median age was 64 (44-83) years; median time since initial diagnosis was 6.9 (1.6-24.5) years. Extramedullary plasmacytomas were present in 25.2% of pts; 29.9% of pts had high-risk cytogenetics. Median number of prior regimens was 6 (3-23). All pts were triple-class exposed; prior therapies included autologous stem cell transplantation (78.5%), PIs (100%), IMiD agents (LEN [100%] and POM [100%]), and anti-CD38 mAbs (100%); 99.1% of pts were refractory to last myeloma regimen and 97.2% of pts were triple-class refractory. Median follow-up was 7.69 (0.5-17.5) months, with a median number of 4 (1-17) cycles received and 13 (12.1%) pts continuing treatment. Main reason for discontinuation was progressive disease (69.2%). ORR was 26.2%, with 1 (0.9%) stringent complete response, 8 (7.5%) very good partial responses, and 19 (17.8%) partial responses (Table); the clinical benefit rate (\u2265 minimal response) was 36.4% and disease control rate (\u2265 stable disease) was 79.4%. Median duration of response was 7.0 (4.5-11.3) months (Table), median progression-free survival was 3.0 (2.8-3.7) months, and median overall survival was 11.2 (9.0-not reached) months. Similar response rates were observed among a cohort of pts also exposed to BCMA therapies (N = 24, Table). Grade (Gr) 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 88 (82.2%) pts. Most frequent (\u2265 20% pts) hematologic Gr 3-4 TEAEs were neutropenia (44.9%; and 4.7% febrile neutropenia), anemia (28.0%), thrombocytopenia (21.5%), and leukopenia (20.6%). Gr 3-4 infections were reported in 27.1% of pts; Gr 3-4 pneumonia and COVID-19 occurred in 10.3% and 4.7% of pts, respectively. Occurrence of other Gr 3-4 non-hematologic TEAEs was generally low, including gastrointestinal disorders (5.6%), fatigue (2.8%), rash (1.9%). Fifty-six (52.3%) pts and 20 (18.7%) had IBER dose interruptions and reductions due to TEAEs, respectively. Five (4.7%) pts discontinued due to TEAEs. No pt discontinued IBER due to neutropenia. Overall, HRQoL was maintained in these pts. Conclusions : IBER + DEX demonstrated promising efficacy in pts with heavily pretreated, triple-class exposed and refractory RRMM, as well as in pts who had previously received anti-BCMA therapy; this combination was generally well tolerated and TEAEs were manageable with dose reductions and interruptions. These results support the further development of IBER in MM, including phase 3 trials in combination regimens.
