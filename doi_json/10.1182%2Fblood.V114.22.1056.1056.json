    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1056 Poster Board I-78 Introduction: We previously showed that a prolonged myelosuppressive maintenance chemotherapy was superior to S-HAM as a postremission therapy in patients > 16 years of age with AML after a TAD-HAM double induction therapy and TAD consolidation chemotherapy with regard to relapse-free survival (RFS) and borderline significance of the overall survival (OS) in responding patients (Buchner et al., JCO 2003, 21:4496-4504). Here we present long-term follow-up data with a median follow-up of 7.9 years from diagnosis and 7.1 years from the date of complete remission. Patients and Methods: Eight hundred thirty-two patients (median age, 54 years; range, 16 to 82 years) with de novo AML were upfront randomized in the AMLCG1992 study of the German AML Co-operative Group to receive 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, and daunorubicin (TAD) plus cytarabine and mitoxantrone (HAM; cytarabine 3 g/m 2 [age < 60 years] or 1 g/m 2 [age \u2265 60 years] x 6 (HAM in patients \u2265 60 years only in case of blast persistence on day 16 of therapy) induction, TAD consolidation, and monthly maintenance with cycles of cytarabine combined with either daunorubicin (course 1), 6-thioguanine (course 2), cyclophosphamide (course 3), and again 6-thioguanine (course 4), and restarting with course 1 for 3 years, or to receive TAD-HAM-TAD and one course of intensive consolidation with sequential HAM (S-HAM) with cytarabine 1 g/m 2 (age < 60 years) or 0.5 g/m 2 (age \u2265 60 years) x 8 instead of maintenance. Results: A total of 576 patients (69.2%) achieved a complete remission (CR) those were 294 of 429 (68.5%) patients randomized to receive maintenance and 282 of 403 (70.0%) patients randomized to receive intensive consolidation S-HAM (p=n.s.). 190 patients received maintenance therapy as intended and 135 patients received an intensive consolidation therapy as intended. This prolonged follow-up analysis verified the superior relapse-free survival in all patients in the maintenance arm (10-year RFS 30.0 \u00b1 5.6 versus 19.9 \u00b1 6.1 %, p = 0.015). Stratified by age, the 10-year RFS was superior in younger patients < 60 years (36.9 \u00b1 7.1 versus 25.2 \u00b1 8.0 %, p = 0.038) and borderline significant in elderly patients (17.2 \u00b1 4.5 versus 6.8 \u00b1 6.2 %, p = 0.075). A subgroup analysis of known risk groups (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level < 700U/l versus \u2265 700U/l at diagnosis, cytogenetic risk profile, bone marrow blasts on day 16 after the start of the induction therapy) revealed a superior RFS in the subgroup of patients with LDH level > 700 U/l at diagnosis (33.5 \u00b1 12.3 versus 18.2 \u00b1 9.5 %, p = 0.043). This superior RFS also translated into a superior 10-year relapse-free interval (RFI) of all responding patients in the maintenance arm (35.7 \u00b1 6.3 versus 27.6 \u00b1 5.9 %, p = 0.015) with borderline significance in younger patients (42.9 \u00b1 7.4 versus 35.0 \u00b1 7.4 %, p = 0.053) and a significant difference in elderly patients (20.6 \u00b1 10.0 versus 8.4 \u00b1 7.5 %, p = 0.043). In this updated analysis, there was a trend, but no significant difference in the OS (maintenance arm: 10-year OS 24.3 \u00b1 4.8, intensive consolidation arm: 19.7 \u00b1 4.7 %, p = 0.148), and we verified a trend for a better OS in responding patients for the maintenance arm (10-year OS in responding patients 33.6 \u00b1 7.5 versus 28.5 \u00b1 6.2 %, p = 0.093). The event-free survival (EFS) also showed a trend towards better EFS in the maintenance arm (10-year EFS 20.7 \u00b1 4.2 versus 14.8 \u00b1 4.1 %, p = 0.082) which was significant in elderly patients (10-year EFS 10.5 \u00b1 5.5 versus 3.9 \u00b1 3.7 %, p = 0.044). Discussion : This updated analysis with a long-term follow-up of median 7.9 years from diagnosis and 7.1 years from CR verified the superior RFS and the trend for enhanced OS in responding patients. These results suggest the superiority of a prolonged monthly myelosuppressive maintenance therapy as compared to intensive consolidation S-HAM after TAD-HAM induction and TAD consolidation.
