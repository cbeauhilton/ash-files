    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3792 Introduction: MicroRNAs are single, small non-coding RNA molecules of approximately 21\u201326 nucleotides, which regulate the expression of numerous genes. miRNAs may act either at the post-transcriptional or the post-translational level to repress gene expression; still, upregulation of gene expression has been noticed in some cases as a direct effect of miRNA function. The importance of miRNAs in carcinogenesis is emphasized by the association of cancers with alterations in miRNA expression. Many miRNAs, including let-7a and those of the miR-17-92 cluster (miR-17, miR-20a, etc.), have been shown or are predicted to affect the activities of targeted mRNAs encoding proteins that have oncogenic or anti-oncogenic functions. let-7a downregulates KRAS, while miR-17 and miR-20a downregulate E2F1. Both these proteins are overexpressed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and have been shown to be involved in the pathobiology of the disease. Purpose: In the current study, we examined the prognostic value of let-7a, miR-17 and miR-20a levels in MDS and their potential as novel molecular biomarkers. Furthermore, we investigated the protein expression levels of validated targets of these three miRNAs in bone marrow CD34+ cells of MDS patients. Material and Methods: We evaluated 43 patients with MDS (34 men, 9 women) with a median age of 73 years (range 45\u201387). According to WHO classification, 12 patients (27.9%) were diagnosed with RA, 6 (13.9%) RCMD, 8 (18.6%) with RAEB-I, 7 (16.3%) with RAEB-II, 8 (18.6%) with AML, and 2 (4.7%) with CMML. According to IPSS, 13 patients (32.5%) had low risk, 14 (35.0%) intermediate I risk, 6 (15.0%) intermediate II, and 7 (17.5%) high risk disease. WPSS classification was: 8 (23.5%) very low risk, 5 (14.7%) low risk, 8 (23.5%) intermediate, 9 (26.5%) high risk, and 4 (11.8%) very high risk. We isolated CD34+ cells from bone marrow mononuclear cells from MDS patients, as well as from peripheral blood of donors of CD34+ cells for stem cell transplantation, using magnetic beads. Extraction of small RNA-containing total RNA from CD34+ cells was performed and cDNA of let-7a, miR-17 and miR-20a was synthesized using specific primers. miRNA expression levels were determined using quantitative real-time PCR, the TaqMan\u00ae chemistry and the relative quantification (2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT ) method. The snoRNA RNU48 was used as reference gene. Furthermore, total protein was extracted from CD34+ cells using a lysis buffer and subsequently quantified using the Bradford assay. Western blot analysis was carried out for MYC, E2F1, Cyclin D1 (CCND1), BCL2 and KRAS, while Actin was used as reference protein. Results: In MDS patients, let-7a expression levels were 0.053\u2013506.1 copies/ RNU48 copies, while miR-17 and miR-20a expression levels were 0.005\u20132694.5 and 0.003\u20133116.7 copies/10 3 RNU48 copies, respectively. No significant differences were found between patients and controls regarding let-7a, miR-17 and miR-20a expression. let-7a underexpression was associated with high (>10%) bone marrow blasts percentage ( P =0.036), presence of WHO classification subtypes with poor prognosis (RAEB-I, RAEB-II and AML) ( P =0.020), and high IPSS ( P =0.037). Furthermore, miR-17 underexpression was related to high (>10%) bone marrow blasts percentage ( P =0.008), intermediate and/or high risk karyotype ( P =0.018) and high IPSS ( P =0.016). Moreover, miR-20a underexpression was associated with high IPSS ( P =0.037) and WPSS ( P =0.013). Interestingly, protein expression levels of all targets analyzed in the current study were shown to be lower in samples overexpressing let-7a, miR-17 and/or miR-20a, in comparison with the corresponding protein levels noticed in specimens showing lower expression of these three miRNAs. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that expression levels of let-7a, miR-17 and miR-20a are associated with established prognostic factors in MDS, including IPSS and WPSS. Furthermore, these three miRNAs seem to be implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease, most probably by finely tuning the expression of target proteins that are involved in highly important molecular pathways, therefore affecting key cellular functions, such as cell cycle control, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and regulation of gene expression. Undoubtedly, further studies are needed to confirm the present findings and clarify their association with the pathogenesis of different MDS subgroups.
