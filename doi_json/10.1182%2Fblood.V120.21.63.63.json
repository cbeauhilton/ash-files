    "abstract_text": "Abstract 63 Background: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is one of the most aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) with a median survival of less than five years. Currently, there is no curative therapy available for refractory MCL because of relapse from therapy-resistant tumor cells. It has been well documented that the NF-\u03baB and mTOR pathways are constitutively active in MCL leading to increased survival, proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Therefore, in an effort to improve therapy for refractory MCL, we investigated the antilymphoma activity in vitro and in vivo and associated molecular mechanism of action of 13\u2013197, a quinoxaline analog that specifically perturbs I\u03baB kinase (IKK) \u03b2, an upstream kinase of the NF-\u03baB and mTOR pathways. Methods: Established therapy-resistant from Granta 519 (Ahrens and Chaturvedi et al, Leukemia and Lymphoma doi:10.3109/10428194.2012.691481), other MCL cell lines Mino and Rec-1 and primary MCL cells from patients were used in this study. These MCL cells were treated in vitro with varying concentrations of 13\u2013197 for the different time points. Cellular proliferation/viability, cytomorphology, frequency of cells undergoing apoptosis in treated and control cells were evaluated using 3 [H]-thymidine uptake, MTT assay, cytomorphology and Annexin-V staining methods respectively. The status of key molecules in the NF-\u03baB and mTOR pathways were examined in therapy-resistant and parental MCL cells following treatment with 13\u2013197 using western blot analyses. The results of these analyses were compared to untreated control cells as appropriate and statistical significance of the results were determined using student\u2018t\u2019 test. In addition, in vivo therapeutic efficacy of 13\u2013197 was investigated using NOD-SCID mouse bearing therapy-resistant MCL. Results: Our results showed that 13\u2013197 significantly decreased the proliferation and induced a \u223cfour-fold (P<0.005) increase in apoptosis in parental and therapy-resistant MCL cells compared to control cells. At the molecular level, we observed down-regulation of I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation and inhibition of NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation by the 13\u2013197 in MCL cells. In addition, NF-\u03baB regulated genes such as cyclin D1, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 were down-regulated in 13\u2013197-treated cells. 13\u2013197 also inhibited the phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1, the downstream molecules of mTOR pathway that are also activated in refractory MCL. Further, to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of 13\u2013197 against therapy-resistant MCL in vivo , we treated NOD-SCID mice bearing therapy-resistant MCL with 13\u2013197; there was significantly reduced tumor burden in the kidney (p>0.05), liver (p>0.01), and lungs (p>0.03) of 13\u2013197 treated mice compared to vehicle treated mice. Indeed, 13\u2013197 treatment significantly increased the survival (p>0.001) of MCL transplanted mice. Taken together, our results suggest that 13\u2013197 targets IKK\u03b2 which leads to both the transcriptional (NF-\u03baB) and translational (mTOR) downregulation of gene products (cyclin D1, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1) misregulated in therapy-resistant MCL. Summary/Conclusions: Overall, results suggest that 13\u2013197 perturbs the NF-\u03baB and mTOR pathways leading significant antilymphoma effects in vitro and in vivo thus demonstrates its potentials to be a therapeutic agent for refractory MCL.
