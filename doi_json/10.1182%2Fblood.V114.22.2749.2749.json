Constitutive upregulation of HIF-1/2\u03b1 in solid tumors is correlated with therapy resistance, invasion, and increased risk of metastases. We previously showed that high HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 levels in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells independently predicted for poor clinical outcome (Demock K et al, ASH 2008). These results imply a potential role for HIFs in promoting leukemogenesis and chemoresistance in AML cells. To confirm these findings, we asked: (1) what are the roles of HIF-1 and HIF-2\u03b1 in mediating hypoxic responses in AML cells and (2) can hypoxia and/or changes in HIF-1/2\u03b1 expression alter chemosensitivity of AML cells to standard cytotoxic agents (cytarabine, doxorubicin). Two human AML cell lines (HEL, HL60) were utilized for these studies. AML cells were placed under normoxia and hypoxia (0.5% O2) for 1\u201372 hours (h) and harvested at different time points for evaluation of HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, and VEGF-A (a key downstream mediator of HIFs) expression by Q-PCR and Western blot analysis. We found that HIF-1\u03b1 gene expression was induced within 1h of hypoxia in AML cells with subsequent upregulation and maintenance of HIF-1\u03b1 protein expression for up to 48h. In contrast, HIF-2\u03b1 gene expression peaked at 1h and again at 8h, with HIF-2\u03b1 protein expression maintained for at least 72h. VEGF-A protein levels rose within 8h of hypoxia and continued to increase up to 72h in a HIF-1\u03b1 dependent manner. Next, we examined the effects of normoxia or hypoxia on apoptosis induced by doxorubicin (Dox) treatment from 20\u2013100 nM for 1\u201372h. While normoxic HL60 cells treated with Dox underwent caspase 3-dependent apoptosis and VEGF-A induction in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (as demonstrated by PARP cleavage and flow cytometry), the same cells cultured under chronic hypoxia (48\u201372h) demonstrated significantly less apoptosis and decreased VEGF-A production following Dox. These effects were not agent-specific, as similar results were also noted following cytarabine treatment. To determine whether these changes were related to HIF-1\u03b1 upregulation, we repeated these experiments using mock and HIF-1\u03b1 shRNA knockdown (KD) HL60 clones and found no change in apoptotic response or VEGF-A induction following Dox treatment in control versus HIF-1\u03b1 KD cells. As compared to mock-transfected cells, HIF-1\u03b1 KD AML cells also displayed no difference in overall in vitro proliferation or colony-formation capacity under normoxic or hypoxic conditions and in fact grew faster when engrafted as in vivo tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mouse models. Of note, hypoxic treatment of HIF-1\u03b1 KD cells was also associated with a relative increase in HIF-2\u03b1 protein expression and upregulation of microRNAs (mir-92A and mir-210) associated with angiogenic and HIF-1\u03b1 regulation, respectively, in other cell systems. In conclusion, these data support distinct roles for HIF-1\u03b1 during acute hypoxia and HIF-2\u03b1 during chronic hypoxia in AML. Attenuation of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis appears to occur following prolonged (48\u201372 hours) hypoxia of AML cells via HIF-1\u03b1 independent mechanisms. The role of HIF-2\u03b1 in mediating these hypoxia-induced effects is under active investigation. These findings imply that AML chemotherapy regimens, which eradicate marrow vasculature as well as hematopoietic cells, could also paradoxically promote survival of some AML cells by enhancing marrow hypoxia and chemoresistance.
