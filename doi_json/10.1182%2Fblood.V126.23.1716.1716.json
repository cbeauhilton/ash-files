    "abstract_text": "The emergence of B cell receptor (BCR) kinase inhibitors has proved effective for the treatment of a number of B-cell malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). BTK and PI3K inhibitors have clear efficacy in suppressing tumor progression but have not been curative. A number of patients have developed resistance to these drugs following mutation of the BTK or PLC\u03b32 gene. Whilst, other patients are unable to tolerate these drugs due to adverse events or progress whilst on therapy for unknown reasons. Thus the development of novel drugs which are still effective once other BCR-kinases inhibitors become ineffective is of paramount importance. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is essential for B cell receptor signalling pathways as well as a variety of other surface receptors such as MHCII, FC receptors and integrins, all of which have been shown to play a role in CLL biology. Importantly, Syk inhibition has been shown to overcome resistance to ibrutinib, identifying Syk inhibition as a promising strategy to treat these patients. Furthermore, we have previously shown that IL-4 is found in CLL lymph nodes and can promote resistance to ibrutinib and idelalisib by restoring \u03b1IgM induced calcium flux and phosphorylated ERK (ASH 2014, abstract #3299). IL-4 signalling is mediated through the JAK/STAT signalling pathways via JAK1 and JAK3, therefore simultaneous inhibition of both Syk and JAK1/3 may be therapeutically beneficial over BCR kinase inhibitors alone. Cerdulatinib (PRT062070) is a dual JAK/Syk inhibitor in a phase I open label dose escalation study and is currently demonstrating clinical activity in patients with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies including CLL. Our group has now demonstrated in vitro that cerdulatinib, at plasma concentrations achievable in patients, can induce apoptosis of CLL cells in a concentration and time dependent manner with a mean IC 50 of 3\u00b5M and 1\u00b5M at 48 and 72h respectively, defined by annexin V/PI and cleavage of caspase 3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Apoptosis was caspase dependent since treatment with the pan caspase inhibitor ZVAD.fmk significantly inhibited cerdulatinib induced cell death at 24h. Cerdulatinib induced apoptosis coincided with an increase in pro-apoptotic proteins Noxa and Puma and a decrease in the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Cerdulatinib significantly inhibited IL-4 induced phosphorylation of STAT6 at 300nM (p=.005), BCR induced phosphorylation of AKT S473 with soluble (p=.008) and bead immobilised (BI) (p=.025) \u03b1IgM at 30nM and phosphorylation of AKT T308 with BI \u03b1IgM at 300nM (p=.008). Furthermore, in patients with CLL, it is thought that CD40L and IL-4 are key factors, which promote survival of CLL cells in proliferation centres within the lymph node microenvironment. Therefore, we cultured CLL cells with a vehicle control or IL-4\\CD40L, prior to treatment with cerdulatinib. Cerdulatinib alone induced similar levels of apoptosis irrespective of IL-4/CD40L treatment, suggesting cerdulatinib may be able to overcome microenvironmental signals and target cells within the lymph node. Next we explored the possibility of augmenting cerdulatinib induced apoptosis by simultaneous inhibition with the Bcl-2\\Bcl-X L inhibitor ABT-199. In vitro in the presence of IL-4/CD40L, ABT-199 synergised with cerdulatinib to induce significantly greater cell death than with either agent alone. Therefore these data provide in vitro evidence for the use of cerdulatinib in clinical trials for the treatment of CLL as either a single agent or in combination with other therapies such as ABT-199.
