    "abstract_text": "Objective To investigate the safety and the efficacy of Umibilical cord mesenchymal stem cells(UCMSC) on severe aplastic anemia(SAA). Methods 30 cases who diagnosed SAA in our department from October 2013to January 2016 and treated with UCMSC on the basis of conventional treatment,were enrolled in this study prospectively.The cultured UCMSC using Serum-free culture system in vitro were given to patients with AA, interval of 15 days, 3 times for a course.the conventional treatments include CsA,male hormone and Chinese herb.Observed the changes of Th / Ts before and after treatmen ,Clinical efficacy and UCMSC infusion adverse reactions. Compared the efficacy of UCMSC therapy with conventional therapy of 30 cases of SAA at the same time. Results: Among 30 cases using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell infusion with UCMSC each infusion volume 3.2 \u00d7 106 / kg ~ 4.2 \u00d7 106 / kg, the average of 2.9 \u00d7 106 / kg, the average influsinon three times , 8 cases acquired basic cure, 8 cases acquired remission , 6 cases acquired significant progress in 6 cases, 8 cases were ineffective,with an effective rate of 73.3%.Before UCMSC treatment Th / Ts 0.67 \u00b1 0.41, after1.33 \u00b1 0.45, there was significant difference (P <0.05). There were 4 patients experienced transient fever during the influsion ,disappeared after symptomatic treatment, no other serious adverse reactions.Among 30 cases of SAA recived conventional therapy at the same period , 3cases acquired basic cure, 5cases acquired remission ,8cases acquired significant progress in 6 cases, 14 cases were ineffective,with an effective rate of 53.3%.The difference was significant (P <0.05). Conclusions: In vitro serum-free culture system can be used to culture and expand clinical scale UCMSC.UCMSC infusion can improve the SAA patient's Th / Ts proportion of T lymphocyte subpopulation , can improve the efficacy of new SAA, also more secure, no serious adverse reactions.
