    "abstract_text": "Abstract 634 We systematically explored the immunoglobulin (IG) gene repertoire in 337 cases with splenic marginal-zone lymphoma (SMZL), by far the largest series yet. To resolve classification uncertainties, we included in the analysis only cases with a diagnosis of SMZL based on spleen histopathological findings or cases fulfilling the 2008 SBLG criteria (Matutes et al. Leukemia 2008). We here report that the IG heavy variable (IGHV) gene repertoire in SMZL is remarkably biased, with only three genes accounting for 45.8% of cases (IGHV1-2, 24.9%; IGHV4-34, 12.8%; IGHV3-23: 8.1%, respectively), significantly extending previous similar observations. Particularly for the IGHV1-2 gene, strong biases became evident at the level of utilization of different alleles, since 79/86 rearrangements (92%) utilized allele *04 vs. only 7/86 rearrangements (8%) that utilized allele *02. This is noteworthy, taking into consideration that these two alleles differ in a single nucleotide, leading to a single amino acid change in framework region (FR)-3. The repertoire biases became more pronounced when the analysis was focused on 171 rearrangements from 163 cases classified as SMZL based on splenic histopathology, according to the 2008 WHO criteria. Within this subgroup, 56/171 cases (32.7%) utilized IGHV1-2*04. Noticeably, only 1/17 cases with a diagnosis of splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma utilized IGHV1-2*04 (p67%) of rearrangements utilizing the IGHV3-23, IGHV3-30 and IGHV3-7 genes were \u201csignificantly mutated\u201d; finally, IGHV4-34 gene rearrangements were evenly distributed to the three mutational subgroups. Shared (\u201cstereotyped\u201d) AA changes were identified for IGHV1-2*04 rearrangements, with certain FR2 and FR3 codons emerging as \u201chotspots\u201d for recurrent, conservative AA changes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that more than 30% of cases with a histopathological diagnosis of SMZL on the spleen express IGHV1-2*04 receptors with unusually long VH CDR3s, biased usage of the IGHD3-3 gene, leading to shared \u201cIGHD-derived\u201d VH CDR3 motifs, and very precise molecular features of SHM. The biased expression of a distinctive germline-encoded VH specificity might be considered as evidence for heavy chain dominance in the clonogenic IG receptors in SMZL. These findings allude to selection by specific (super)antigenic element(s) in the pathogenesis of at least a major subset of SMZL. In addition, they raise the intriguing possibility that certain subtypes of SMZL could derive from progenitor cell populations adapted to particular antigenic challenges through cellular selection of VH domain specificities.
