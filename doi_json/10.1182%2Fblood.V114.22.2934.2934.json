Discordant data have been reported about the prevalence of HCV infection in patients with Waldenstro\u0308m's Macroglobulinemia (WM) and the putative role of HCV in lymphomagenesis of this non-Hodgkin Lymphoma subtype remains controversial. Aim: the current retrospective study was conducted to assess the impact of this infection itself in the clinical and biological features and outcome among WM patients as compared with those with HCV negative WM. Patients and methods: we analyzed 140 WM patients with tested anti-HCV antibody (HCV-Ab). HCV-Ab positivity was detected in 21 cases (15%). Clinical characteristics of patients at diagnosis of WM are reported in the table below.  Characteristics . All patients . HCV- . HCV+ . P .

Interestingly we even found a strong link between the presence of HCV and serum parameters of tumor burden such as beta-2 microglobulin (B2-M) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Furthermore we did not reveal any outcome implications in terms of disease progression needing treatment, time from diagnosis to first therapy, overall survival between HCV- and HCV+ patients. Overall, 88 patients (63%) received treatment for disease progression with schedules including Rituximab in 46 cases (52% of treated patients). Rituximab was administered even in HCV-RNA positive patients associated to Cyclophosphamide and Fludarabine and this did not translate in hepatitis development. HCV-RNA was strictly monitored during immunotherapy and we did not observe any significant flair. Conclusions: in our series of patients HCV infection does not seem to affect clinical outcome of disease. Moreover, in our experience patients with documented infection can receive the same schedule of treatment including intensive chemotherapy even with monoclonal antibodies without development of further toxicity.
