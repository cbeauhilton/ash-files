    "abstract_text": "Background: Lymphoproliferative disorders have increased in last decades. The value of the cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) plus rituximab (R-CHOP) combination therapy in both aggressive and indolent B-cell lymphoma has been demonstrated in several clinical trials. Treatment of patients > 65 years remains controversial and chemotherapy dose has been decreased due to comorbities, particularly cardiac insuficiency Methods: Retrospective, comparative, non randomized study. Inclussion criteria: > 65 years patients with hystologically diagnosis of DLBCL, treated in a single national reference, from January 2011 until January 2015. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities were analyzed. Three regimens of treatment (RCHOP , RChOP & RCOP, see doses in table) were compared in terms of response, efficacy and survival. Descriptive analysis was done fore demographic & clinical characteristics. Suvival was calculated with Kaplan-Meier method Log rank test analysis was done to compare DFS & OS, stratifed by treatment regimen. Results: 141 cases, with a median age of 74.15 y (range 65- 96 y), None difference was found among the 3 treatment regimens for the following variables: Comorbities are detailed by treatment group in the following table. (25 % Diabetes mellitus, 29 % blood hypertension), B symptoms (70 %), clinical stage III- IV ( 68 %), most had an adequate ECOG (1-2: 90 %), and most were considere as high-intermediate or high risk (68 %) according with R-IPI scale. However, only a higher proportion of patients with GC subtype was documented in RCHOP patients (54.7 % vs 35 % and 27.1% in RChOP & RCOP groups, respectively. Global response (CR + PR) was achieved in 77.3 %, 60 % & 68.8 % in patients treated with RCHOP, RChop & RCOP, respectively. The following table describes toxicities by treatment regimen. DFS (but not OS) and OS was better in patients with RCHOP. Table.  . RCHOP . RChoP . RCOP . P .

Although regimens with chemotherapy dose reductions (mini-RCHOP) have been accepted for these patients, an individual evaluation is recommended in this population.
