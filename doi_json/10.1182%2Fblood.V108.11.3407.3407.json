    "article_title": "High Resolution Array CGH Identifies TRAF3 as a Novel Tumor Suppressor in Multiple Myeloma. ",

    "abstract_text": "In an attempt to identify novel genetic abnormalities in multiple myeloma (MM) we analyzed 68 MM patient samples and 42 human myeloma cell lines (HMCL) with high-resolution (60kb) array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). We concentrated on bi-allelic genomic deletions with the expectation that these regions might contain novel tumor suppressor genes and identified a common abnormality at 14q32. Fine mapping of the 14q32 microdeletion by PCR demonstrated a 45 kb minimal deletion encompassing two genes; TRAF3, a negative regulator of the non-canonical NF-kB pathway, and AMN. To determine the frequency of copy number abnormalities of this region a cohort of 161 patients were screened with a FISH probe mapping to the minimally deleted region. This identified 7 (4.4%) patients with bi-allelic deletion and 19 (11.8%) patients with a single copy of the target region. Sequencing of all TRAF3 coding exons in 62 patients and 42 HMCL identified inactivating mutations in 9 patient samples and 4 HMCL. Overall, the incidence of TRAF3 inactivation, bi-allelic deletion or mutation, is 7/42 (16.7%) in HMCL and 12/62 (19.4%) in patients, making it one of the most common genetic abnormalities identified in MM. Importantly, dysregulation of NF-kB pathways is a common event in MM, but the mechanism for this dysregulation is largely unknown. Although TRAF3 is a negative regulator of the non-canonical NF-kB pathway it has not previously been implicated in cancer. Therefore, we tested the tumor suppressor function of TRAF3 by reintroducing TRAF3 into HMCL harboring TRAF3 abnormalities using an adenovirus gene transfer system. Expression of TRAF3 in HMCL with TRAF3 abnormalities rapidly reversed cellular processing of NFKB2 from p100 (an inactive isoform) to p52 (active) and additionally led to a 60% reduction in cellular proliferation (range, 10\u201389%) associated with Go/G1 cell cycle arrest and induction of cell death by apoptosis. At 48 hrs post infection the proportion of cells entering S-phase or G2/M declined by 31% (range, 8.1\u201356.1) and the proportion undergoing apoptosis increased by 28% (range 11.7\u201347.4%). In contrast, over-expression of TRAF3 in control HMCL without TRAF3 abnormalities had no effect. Overall, TRAF3 is identified as a novel tumor suppressor that regulates the non-canonical NF-kB pathway and is inactivated in ~ 20% of MM patients. Given the involvement of the NF-kB pathway in multiple human malignancies and the near constitutive expression of TRAF3 we propose that inactivation of TRAF3, a novel tumor suppressor identified for the first time in this study, may occur in other cancers. In this regard, we have recently identified a Burkitt lymphoma cell line that does not express TRAF3 and thus has constitutive processing of p100 to p52. The clinical and therapeutic consequences of this finding and its frequency in other tumor types are currently the focus of further investigation. In conclusion, the abnormalities identified in this study represent the first mutations identified that cause constitutive NF-kB activation in MM.",
