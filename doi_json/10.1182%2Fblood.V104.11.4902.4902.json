    "abstract_text": "OBJECTIVES: In a joint study of the GMMG and HOVON groups, induction therapy with Thalidomide (Thal), doxorubicin and dexamethasone (TAD) is currently investigated in comparison with vincristin, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (VAD) followed by mobilisation therapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (CAD) and peripheral blood stem cell collection (PBSC). Munshi et al. (Blood 1999, Abstract #2577) described a dampening of PBSC-mobilisation by Thal treatment. We therefore investigated a possible influence of PBSC after previous Thal administration. METHODS: Altogether, data on 112 patients were analyzed in terms of PBSC-mobilisation. 56 patients were randomized up-front to receive 3 cycles of TAD (Thal 400mg/d orally; doxorubicin 9mg/m 2 /d, 4 30-min. infusions, day 1\u20134; dexamethasone 480mg total dose orally). 56 patients received VAD (vincristin 0,4mg/d and doxorubicin 9mg/m 2 /d, 4 30-min. infusions, day 1\u20134.; dexamethasone 480mg total dose orally) followed by mobilisation with CAD (cyclophosphamide 1g/m 2 /d, 1h infusion, day 1; doxorubicin 15mg/m 2 /d, 4 short infusions, day 1\u20134; dexamethasone 160mg total dose orally) and G-CSF (Neupogen 600mg/d s.c. or Granocyte 526mg/d s.c., day 5 after the end of chemotherapy until PBSC). Thal was stopped two weeks before CAD. Low dose heparine was administered to prevent deep venous thromboses in the TAD group. RESULTS: The median time was 14 days after the first day of CAD until PBSC in patients in both the TAD (range 12\u201318 days) and VAD group (range 10\u201319 days). In the first leukapheresis, a median total PBSC yield of 8,1x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells in the TAD/CAD (range 0,3\u201334x10 6 CD34+ cells) and 8,7x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells in the VAD/CAD (range 0,5\u201330x10 6 CD34+ cells) group could be harvested (p=0.31). In the best leukapheresis, a median total PBSC yield of 8,1x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells in the TAD/CAD (range 0,7\u201334x10 6 CD34+ cells) and 8,9x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells in the VAD/CAD (range 2\u201330x10 6 CD34+ cells) group could be reached (p=0.24). CONCLUSIONS: No difference was found in stem cell collection and yield after TAD versus VAD. Thalidomide as a part of induction therapy does not seem to have an influence of the peripheral blood stem cell collection of patients with multiple myeloma.",
