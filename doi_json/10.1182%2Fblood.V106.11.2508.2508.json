    "abstract_text": "Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable hematological malignancy characterized by the expansion of a plasma cell clone that localizes to the bone marrow. Stromal cells residing in the bone marrow respond to signals from MM cells and other cell types by producing cytokines and other proteins that stimulate tumor cell growth, survival, adhesion, migration, and drug resistance. We have examined the proteins produced by stromal cells in response to stimulation by bone marrow from patients diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), and MM. Furthermore, we have begun analyzing the properties of one of these proteins, the pro-angiogenic chemokine IL-8, in MM. Methods: Bone marrow aspirates from patients with MGUS (n=3), SMM (n=7), and MM (n=6) were cultured for 48 hours, and the culture supernatants were incubated with stromal cells for an additional 48 hours. Protein levels were analyzed using antibody array and ELISA. Microvessel density (MVD) was determined as a measure of angiogenesis in patient bone marrow samples using CD34 staining. Flow cytometry analysis of MM cell lines and patient bone marrow samples was performed using monoclonal antibodies against IL-8 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. Results and Conclusion: We observed a significant increase in stromal cell IL-8 production stimulated by bone marrow cells from patients with active myeloma and a subset of SMM patients (16.67 \u00b1 9.82 ng/ml) in comparison to bone marrow of patients with MGUS and all other SMM patients (0.55 \u00b1 0.17 ng/ml; P=0.0004). Use of an IL-1 inhibitor and recombinant IL-1\u03b2 demonstrated that IL-8 production was dependent upon IL-1\u03b2 signaling. Increased BM microvessel density correlated with stimulation of stromal cell IL-8 production (P=0.0005). Furthermore, the majority of MM cell lines (7/9) and MM patient plasma cells were found to express IL-8 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. In addition to its function as a pro-angiogenic factor, IL-8 may directly influence MM cells through its CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors. We conclude that stromal cell IL-8 production parallels MM disease activity, is IL-1\u03b2 induced, correlates with bone marrow angiogenesis, and may influence MM disease via impact upon both the microenvironment and tumor cells."
