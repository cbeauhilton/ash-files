    "abstract_text": "Background Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are molecular markers that vary significantly among different populations. Our group has earlier reported about different genetic associations of SNPs with GvHD and/or outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in different retrospective studies. Here we profiled SNPs in a non interventional prospective study (Trial No DRKS00004352) about the influence of different endpoints for patients (pts) with acute myeloid leukemia who underwent allogeneic HSCT between June 2011 and February 2013. Methods We analyzed simultaneously 48 different genes of every patient/donor pairs in whole blood by high-throughput LightCycler\u00ae 480 real-time PCR-system using high resolution melting optimization strategies. Results In this cohort 20 pts received grafts from HLA-identical siblings (23%), 42 pts from matched (48%) and 26 pts from mismatched (30%) unrelated donors. Transplant consisted of unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells (n=79, 90%) or bone marrow (n=9, 10%). Of all pts (n=88, male 48 pts and female 40 pts), 18 (21%) had relapsed and 28 (32%) died of May 2013. In the cohort the occurrence of acute GvHD (aGvHD) grade 2-4 was influenced by gene variants on recipient side of CYP 2C9 (39% vs 72%, p<0.04), IL16 (53% vs 31%, p<0.01) and MTHFR 677, 1298 (31% vs. 52%, p<0.05). Furthermore, the occurrence of severe aGvHD \u22653 was influenced by GSTP1 A/G (3% vs 20%, p<0.04), LAT (6% vs 17%, p<0.02), MBL2 codon 550 (3% vs 22%, p<0.03), and VEGF 405 G/C (15% vs 7%, p<0.02). There was no significant correlation between different gene variants of pts and the estimate for 1-year overall survival (OS). We found that the rate of 1-year none-relapse mortality (NRM) was associated favorably with the detection of variants of NOD2 genes (0% vs 26%, p<0.04) and MBL codon 220 (7% vs 32%, p<0.05) and associated adversely with the detection of variants of LAT (16% vs 34%, p<0.03). The estimate 1-year relapse rate was associated adversely with the detection of variants of IL 10 592 C/A (15% vs 45%, p<0.05) and associated favorable with the detection of variants of TLR9 genes (40% vs. 10%, p<0.02) Conclusions These preliminary results suggest that different gene variants have influence on the transplant settings in pts with acute myeloid leukemia. Disclosures: Off Label Use: HCG will be discussed as new therapy for chronic GVHD."
