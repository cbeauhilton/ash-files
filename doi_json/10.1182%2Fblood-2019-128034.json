    "abstract_text": "Metabolic alterations of cancer cells, aimed at sustaining their growth, may also influence the behavior of the tumor microenvironment. Our group has recently demonstrated that multiple myeloma (MM) is a highly glutamine(Gln)-addicted tumor that utilize huge amounts of Gln to fuel its metabolism through the enzyme glutaminase (GLS). For this reason, MM cells exhibits increased Gln uptake, mainly through the ASCT2 transporter. Interestingly, lower bone marrow (BM) plasma Gln concentration (down to a median value of 0.4 mM vs. a median value of 0.6 mM) was found in MM patients as compared with smoldering MM (SMM) and Monoclonal Gammopathy of Uncertain Significance (MGUS). The main feature of MM BM microenvironment is the suppression of osteoblastic (OB) differentiation leading to the development of osteolytic bone lesions, the hallmark of MM. Most recently, it has been demonstrated that Gln metabolism is needed to sustain bone mass formation in murine models and that GLS inhibition decreases OB differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). However, no information is yet available on the role of Gln depletion imposed by MM cell metabolism on OB differentiation into the BM. This topic has been investigated in the present study. Firstly, human MM cells were co-cultured with BM hMSCs, and Gln medium concentration was evaluated with mass spectrometry (MS), demonstrating a MM-induced depletion of the amino acid. Upon Gln depletion, MSC exhibited a sustained induction of Glutamine Synthetase (GS). On the contrary, when differentiated in osteogenic medium (D-MEM + 5% Fetal Bovine Serum, supplemented with 2 mM Gln, ascorbic acid and dexamethasone), GS was suppressed. Conversely, GLS (both KGA and GAC isoforms) and SLC38A2 , the gene for the concentrative Gln transporter SNAT2, were induced. These data suggest that hMSCs differentiation in OBs is associated with an increased dependence upon extracellular Gln. Consistent with this conclusion, the activity of SNAT2 was absent in undifferentiated hMSCs but well detectable after 14 days of OB differentiation, when total Gln uptake was also increased. Under the same conditions, OB differentiation markers ( RUNX2 , COL1A1 , ALPL expression and ALPL activity or staining) were significantly induced but their expression was blunted by incubation in low-Gln (0.4 mM) medium or in the presence of the SNAT2 inhibitor MeAIB. The incubation in Gln-free D-MEM suppressed the induction of GLS and SLC38A2 along with OB differentiation, which was restored by the supplementation of Non-Essential Amino Acids (NEAA). Among NEAA, only asparagine (Asn) was able to rescue OB differentiation in the absence of Gln. The determination of intracellular amino acids with MS indicated that OB differentiation was associated with the increase of cell Asn, without significant changes of Gln, glutamate (Glu) or aspartate (Asp). Asparagine Synthetase (ASNS), the Gln-dependent enzyme that accounts for Asn synthesis, was also found induced during OB differentiation of hMSCs. Gene Expression Profiles of primary BM hMSCs and OBs from bone biopsies of both healthy donors (n=7) and MM patients (n=16) indicated that GLS , ASNS , and SLC38A2 are more expressed in OBs, while the expression of GLUL , the gene for GS, is higher in undifferentiated hMSCs from healthy donors. Overall, these results indicate that (1) OB differentiation of hMSCs is Gln-dependent; (2) the partial Gln depletion, imposed by Gln-addicted MM cells in the BM microenvironment, contributes to the impairment of osteoblastic differentiation of hMSCs; (3) hindrance of differentiation may depend on the limited availability of intracellular Asn derived from Gln-dependent ASNS . These results support the evidence that Gln addiction of MM cells affects bone microenvironment leading to the inhibition of OB differentiation and, consequently, to the development of MM bone disease.
