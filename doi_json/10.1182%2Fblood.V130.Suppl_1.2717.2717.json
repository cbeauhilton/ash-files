    "abstract_text": "High throughput genomic technologies, such as high-density SNP arrays and whole exome and transcriptome sequencing (WES, RNAseq), significantly deepened our insight into the genomic background and biology of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during the past decade. Novel genetic aberrations and genomic and gene expression patterns have been described which led to the definition of several novel ALL subtypes and risk-predictive factors and to the identification of novel druggable and/or resistance-associated lesions potentially impacting therapy tailoring. Anecdotal evidence of therapeutical interventions based on the up-to-date genetic data has resulted into a great demand for these investigations. However, it is unclear what proportion of pediatric ALL patients, especially the cases of therapy-resistant leukemia, would really benefit from extensive genomic profiling. Between V/2013 and VIII/2017, relapse of Ph-negative B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL was diagnosed in 20 children (1-18 years) within the Czech Republic. In addition to the routine genetics, 18/20 cases were profiled by high density SNP array (18/18), WES (18/18) and RNAseq (17/18). The examined cohort comprised 10 B-other, 4 hyperdiploid, 3 ETV6-RUNX1 -positive and 1 KMT2A -rearranged ALL. At primary leukemia manifestation, all children were treated according to the ALL-BFM protocols [BFM 95 (n=1), BFM 2000 (n=1) and BFM 2009 (n=16)] and suffered very early (n=1), early (n=4) or late relapses (n=13). Upon disease relapse, 5, 11 and 2 cases were treated according to ALL-REZ BFM 2002 and IntReALL 2010 SR and HR protocols, respectively. Bulk bone marrow (BM) samples or sorted leukemic blasts were analyzed in isolated BM (n=15) and combined BM+CNS (n=2) relapses, while tissue from uterus infiltrated with blasts was analyzed in a single case of isolated extramedullary relapse. In addition to leukemic blasts, remission samples were analyzed by WES in all and by SNP array in selected cases to distinguish germline genetic variants. Somatic copy number aberrations and regions of uniparental disomy were called from SNP array data using commercial softwares. WES and RNAseq data were processed and somatic single nucleotide variants, indels and fusion transcripts were called using in-house pipeline based on publicly available software tools. Targeted analysis was performed to identify DUX4 gene rearrangements (r.). Hierarchical clustering based on gene expression profiles (unsupervised clustering and clustering with gene sets defining DUX4 -r., Ph-like and ETV6-RUNX1 -like ALL) was performed using RNAseq data. To facilitate this analysis, gene expression data from relapse cohort were combined with primary diagnosis data from >50 B-other ALL cases. Clinically important findings were reported to national study centre. Two B-other cases were classified as DUX4 -r. and 2 other cases as Ph-like ALL. Of note, 2 cases (both treated as standard risk in primary diagnosis) had iAMP21. Apart from 3 CRLF2 -rearrangements (1 present in Ph-like case), 6 KRAS and 2 NRAS genes mutations, no potentially druggable lesions were found. While the frequency of CRLF2 -rearrangements and RAS mutations found in relapse was comparable to that seen in primary disease, relapse cohort was enriched for lesions associated with unfavorable prognosis and therapy resistance. Three and four cases harbored deletion of TP53 gene and IKZF1 plus deletion pattern; however, in 1/2 cases with available data from primary diagnosis the IKZF1 plus pattern was identified only in relapse. Deletion of CREBBP and TBL1XR1 genes, potentially associated with resistance to glucocorticoids, were found in 2 cases and 1 case, respectively. Mutations of NT5C2 gene resulting in resistance to mercaptopurine were found in 2 cases. Three out of 18 analyzed cases did not harbor any of the above mentioned lesions. None of the genetic findings directly impacted patients' treatment. To conclude, we successfully implemented advanced genomics into centralized diagnostics of resistant ALL at the national level. Although it improved our understanding of disease relapse (yet, not in 100% of cases) the results were not translated to therapy tailoring in patients treated according to the large international protocols, thus, questioning the cost/benefit ratio of such extensive genetic diagnostics.
