    "abstract_text": "Histone acetylation plays a key role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression. The activities of histone deacetylases (HDAC), enzymes that remove acetyl groups from lysines located at the amino-terminal tails of core histones, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies. Consequently, inhibitors of these enzymes (HDACi) are considered an important new class of drugs for use in anti-cancer therapy and are now in various stages of development and clinical trials. For example, depsipeptide has now been granted a fast track designation by the FDA for development as a treatment for CTCL. To date, eleven HDACs have been identified and grouped on the basis of sequence homology to class I (HDACs 1\u20133 and 8), IIa (4, 5, 7 and 9) and IIb (6, 10 and 11). Depsipeptide and other currently used HDACi lack class and enzyme specificities. Additionally, the contribution of each HDAC to the pathogenesis of a given malignant disease is poorly understood. Improvements in HDACi specificities, together with advances in the understanding of the roles that individual HDACs play in normal hematopoiesis and distinct hematological neoplasms, are required for an effective use of these agents in anti-cancer therapies. We have previously identified and characterized HDAC9 as a class IIa enzyme that within the hematopoietic system is preferentially expressed in the lymphoid lineage. HDAC9 appears to be overexpressed in B lymphoid malignancies and associates at physiological levels with the BCL6 oncoprotein ( Petrie et al, JBC  278 : 16059 \u201372, 2003 ), a transcriptional repressor implicated in the pathogenesis of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, suggesting a role for this chromatin modifying enzyme in B-cell transformation. In order to examine the function of HDAC9 in lymphoid development and cancer, we have generated transgenic mice that express the protein throughout the B lymphoid compartment under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer (E \u03bc ). Initial data show that at an average of seven months these mice display splenomegaly and alterations to the splenic and bone marrow lymphoid populations. The presence of immature lymphocytes was also detected in peripheral blood. Consistent with these results and the above hypothesis, knockdown of HDAC9 results in strong inhibition of cell growth. These data indicate that aberrant expression of HDAC9 confers a proliferative advantage and leads to a phenotype resembling a pre-malignant condition.",
