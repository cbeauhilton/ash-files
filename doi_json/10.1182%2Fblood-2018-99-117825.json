    "abstract_text": "Objective: Retrospectively analysing the outcome of additional medium-dose etoposide (VP-16 30mg/kg) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Methods: From 2010.10.1 to 2018.6.30, 53 ALL patients received allo-HSCT in Shandong provincial hospital. 20 conditioning with medium-dose VP-16 (15 in CR , 5 in refractory and/or relapse disease) (VP-16 group), 33 conditioning without medium-dose VP-16 (32 in CR and 1 in refractory and/or relapse disease) (control group) . The basic conditions of the primary disease, treatment-related toxicity, leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and relapse-free survival (GRFS), non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse incidence (RI), GVHD and so on were compared between the two groups. Results: The VP-16 group included more R/R(refractory and/or relapse disease) patients and was associated with improved 3-year-LFS (70.7% vs. 56.5%, p= 0.565) and 3-year-OS (68% vs. 59.4%, p=0.825), although there was no statistical difference. Moreover, the additional of VP-16 lead to reduced incidence of aGVHD (II,III,IV) (10% vs. 30.7%, p=0.146) and cGVHD (9.1% vs 24%, p=0.25), resulting in improved GRFS (63.6% vs. 48.7%, P=0.343). RI was similar between the two group (29.3% vs 27.2%, p=0.76). Meanwhile, the addition of VP-16 enhanced the intensity of conditioning regimen, its NRM was relatively lower than control group (0% vs. 20.2%, P=0.371). Conclusion: The intensified conditioning regimen with medium-dose VP-16 did not increase NRM and GVHD, with tendency to increase OS and LFS, may become an effective pre-treatment scheme in allo-HSCT for ALL.
