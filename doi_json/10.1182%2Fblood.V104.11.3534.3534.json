    "abstract_text": "GTP-binding protein G\u03b1q plays a major role in platelet signal transduction. We studied the transcriptional regulation of the human G\u03b1q gene in a megakaryocytic cell line, human erythroleukemia (HEL). 10 nM phorbal myristate acetate (PMA) was used to induce megakaryocytic lineage in HEL cells. Western blot analysis on untreated vs PMA-treated HEL lysates showed enhanced G\u03b1q expression with PMA. Firefly luciferase reporter gene constructs carrying various lengths of the G\u03b1q gene upstream promoter region \u22121/\u22122727 bp from ATG codon, were transiently transfected into PMA-treated HEL cells. G\u03b1q promoter driven luciferase expression was measured by Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). These studies indicated that the G\u03b1q gene is regulated by positive and negative elements. Two positive regulatory sites were identified in the proximal region (\u2212138/\u2212238 bp) and distal region (\u2212731/\u22121116 bp); a negative regulatory site was observed further upstream (\u22121117/\u22122727 bp). The proximal region \u2212138/\u2212238 was resolved into a repressor (\u2212207/\u2212238) and a positive (\u2212138/\u2212207) site. Consensus sequences for two well recognized megakaryocytic transcription factors (TFs) PU.1 (\u2212225/\u2212230) and GATA-1 (\u2212208/\u2212211) in the repressor site were deleted; this had no effect on promoter activity. The positive region (\u2212138/\u2212207) was further resolved into repressor (\u2212162/\u2212186) and positive (\u2212187/\u2212207) regions by functional studies. In the repressor region a CCACC (\u2212175/\u2212179) consensus motif for Sp/XKLF family of TF was found and deleted; the repressor activity was lost indicating a functional effect of the CCACC-motif. The positive region contained a Sp1/AP2 consensus sites between \u2212152 and \u2212203. Gel shift and super shift experiments on double stranded DNA oligo 1 (\u2212175/\u2212203) and oligo 2 (\u2212152/\u2212174) using HEL extracts demonstrated nuclear protein binding to these regions. However, antibodies against Sp1 and AP2 or the consensus oligos did not alter the binding. Gel shift mutant analysis was performed on both oligos to define the functional sequences mediating the nuclear protein binding. Mutations made at \u2212190/\u2212194, which has a consensus sequence for EGR1/EGR2 and, at \u2212180/\u2212184 and at \u2212156/\u2212160, abolished the protein binding suggesting that they are preferred sequences for DNA-protein interaction. The distal upstream positive region \u2212731/\u22121116 also revealed positive and negative elements. Mutation in the EGR-2 consensus sequence (\u2212909/\u2212919) decreased the promoter activity to 50% and mutation in the AP2/EGR-1/Sp1 consensus sequence (\u2212885/\u2212893) abolished the promoter activity. Our results suggest that the sequences \u2212156/\u2212160, \u2212180/\u2212184, and \u2212190/\u2212194 in the proximal region, and \u2212885/\u2212893 and \u2212909/\u2212919 in the distal region have a critical role in the transcriptional regulation of G\u03b1q in megakaryocytic cells.",
