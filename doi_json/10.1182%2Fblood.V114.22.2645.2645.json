Activated Akt is known to function as an essential survival factor by inhibiting apoptosis through its ability to phosphorylate several targets including Bad, FoxO transcription factors, Raf-1, caspase-9 and inhibitor of apoptosis protein family (IAPs). Survivin is a member of IAP regulating both apoptosis and cell cycle progression. Survivin binds to several structural components of the mitotic apparatus and can block apoptosis by inhibiting caspases 9, 3 and 7. Recently the importance of PI3/Akt/survivin pathway in solid neoplasias such as breast or prostate cancer has been highlighted but its role in AML remains unknown. In this work we analyzed the PI3/Akt/survivin pathway in human AML. METHODS: Bone marrow samples obtained at diagnosis of 68 AML consecutive patients and K562, MV4-11 and HL-60 cell lines were included. Patients Median age was 62 years (range 8\u201389). Median leukocyte count was 10.3\u00d710 9 /L (range 0.8\u2013285). FAB subtypes were: M0=8, M1=20, M2=13, M3=8, M4=11, M5=7 and M6=1 with the following cytogenetic findings: t(15;17)=8, t(8;21)=2, complex karyotype=8, 11q23=2, normal karyotype=36 and others=12. There were 11.3% patients with FLT3-ITD and 16.9% with NPM1 mutation. Cytoplasmic and nuclear Proteins were harvested with Q-proteome cell compartment (Qiaqen) and protein concentration assayed using Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Total Akt, Akt-pSer473 and survivin proteins were detected by Western Blot and were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL-Plus, GE Healthcare) in Chemigenius-2 and quantified using Gene-Tools software. Cell cycle analysis was assessed by double Hoechst 33342- Pyronin Y staining and flow cytometry in FACSvantage. Inhibition experiments were done using Ly294002 at 25 \u03bcM, and Wortmaninn at 250 nM for 12 hours. RESULTS: In our series p-Ser473Akt was detected in 56% of AML marrow samples (with high levels expression in 27%) and in all cell lines. In cytoplasmic protein extracts, Survivin WT and 2B isoform were detected in 45% and 45.2% of patients respectively. All three leukemic cell lines showed only Survivin 2B expression. Interestingly, there was strong statistical correlation between the levels of p-Ser473Akt with cytoplasmic Survivin (P=.01). Inhibitors of PI3K/Akt pathway LY294002 and Wortmaninn both decreased in vitro p-Ser473Akt expression but only the irreversible action of Wortmaninn caused a marked dowregulation of cytoplasmic survivin. Meaningfully, lack of cytoplasmic Survivin was associated with an increased proportion of cells in Go cell cycle phase (11.1 % vs. 3.6%, P=.04). Moreover, cytoplasmic Survivin WT localization and high p-Ser473 Akt levels, were both significantly correlated with less unfavourable FAB leukemia subtype and cytogenetic risk (P<.01), more CR achievement with one induction cycle (P<.01), less relapse rate (P=.01) and less mortality rate (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Survivin cytoplasmic expression is regulated by PI3-kinase/Akt pathway in AML. The activation of PI3/Akt/survivin pathway is associated with an increased proliferative status and our series suggest that this finding could be associated with a more favorable outcome.
