    "abstract_text": "Clinical and preclinical data suggest that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with mutated nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1 mut ) may constitute an immunogenic leukemia subtype. NPM1 mut AML generally correlates with a better prognosis, however the underlying mechanisms still need to be clarified. Checkpoint inhibition targeting Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) has been proven to be an effective novel immunotherapeutic approach in cancer treatment including the treatment of hematological malignancies. Expression of CD34/CD38/CD274 was evaluated in 20 NPM1 mut versus 20 wild-type ( NPM1 wt ) AML patient samples via flow cytometry analyses to assess PD-L1 (CD274) expression in leukemic cells, including leukemic progenitor and stem cells (LSC). We also investigated the influence of the anti-PD-1 antibody Nivolumab\u00ae on the antigen-specific immune responses in ELISpot assays. Additionally, we assessed the effect of Nivolumab in colony forming unit (CFU) immunoassays. Many AML cases showed relevant expression of PD-L1. Bulk cells of NPM1 mut AML showed a significantly higher PD-L1 expression in comparison to NPM1 wt AML patients (median of 1.5%, range 0.0-8.5%, versus 0.3%, range 0.1-1.1%). Importantly, PD-L1 expression was detected at a higher level in leukemic progenitor cells (CD34+CD38-) of NPM1 mut than of NPM1 wt AML (median of 3.3%, range 0.0-17.2%, versus 0.3%, range 0.0-3.0%). In general, the LSC fraction showed a higher PD-L1 expression than the non-LSC fraction. CFU immunoassays showed a significant inhibition of CFU when adding T cells stimulated against various LAA. In all patient samples, effectors activated against at least one LAA were successful to decrease the colony number significantly. Immune effects increased adding Nivolumab to the CTL for several days before starting CFU immunoassays. In summary, we detected higher PD-L1 expression in NPM1 mut patients, especially in the leukemic progenitor compartment. This observation further supports the hypothesis that NPM1-directed immune responses might play an important role in tumor cell rejection, which tumor cells try to escape via expression of PD-L1. Immunogenicity of neoantigens derived from NPM1 mut with higher PD-L1 expression constitute promising target structures for individualized immunotherapeutic approaches.
