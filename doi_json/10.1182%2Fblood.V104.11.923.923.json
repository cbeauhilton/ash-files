    "abstract_text": "Over the past 10 years, HDM/SCT has been employed for treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis. Although peri-transplant mortality is greater than for other hematologic diseases, HDM/SCT leads to durable hematologic complete responses (CR), improvements in organ function, and extended survival in a substantial proportion of patients (Skinner et al., Ann. Int. Med. 2004). In that study, the proportion of patients eligible for HDM/SCT was lower for patients >65 years of age than for younger patients (34.3% vs. 68.4%), but the hematologic complete response (CR) rate and survival appeared to be no different. Here, we update these results and present a detailed analysis of outcomes in patients >65 vs. those 65. The median age of the 66 patients was 68, range 65\u201380; 73% male; 18% ? and 82% ?, while for the 283 patients 65 versus 10.3% of patients 65 received an IV dose of melphalan of 200 mg/m2 (the remainder being treated with 140 mg/m2 or less), vs. 64% of those 65 vs. 13.4% in patients 65 vs. 20.9% for those 65 vs. 4.6 years for those 65 meet eligibility requirements for HDM/SCT, for those who do, treatment-related mortality, hematologic CR rate, and survival are no different than for younger patients. These data strongly support the use of HDM/SCT for suitable patients with AL amyloidosis who are >65 years old. View large Download slide Figure. View large Download slide Figure. "
