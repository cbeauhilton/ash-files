    "abstract_text": "Despite new treatment modalities, the clinical outcome of at least a subgroup of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) still needs improvement. Antibody-based targeted therapies are increasingly used for tumor therapy, and may represent interesting options for MM patients. HM1.24 is a surface molecule that is over expressed on malignant plasma cells and efficiently internalized from the cell surface. It may represent a promising target for the development of myeloma-directed immunoconstructs. Here, the development and characterization of a novel single-chain immunotoxin, HM1.24-ETA\u2032, is described. HM1.24-ETA\u2032 was generated by genetic fusion of an HM1.24-specific single-chain Fv (scFv) antibody and a truncated variant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ETA\u2032). The immunotoxin was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography. Specific binding to HM1.24 was demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry using antigen positive and negative cells. HM1.24-ETA\u2032 efficiently inhibited growth of IL-6 dependent and IL-6 independent myeloma cell lines (INA-6, RPMI8226, U266). Half maximal growth inhibition was observed at low nanomolar concentrations. Further analyses demonstrated that target cell killing occurred via induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining and detection of PARP cleavage. The cytotoxic effect was completely blocked by adding excess of unconjugated parental antibody, demonstrating that the effect was antigen-specific and not mediated by non-specific uptake of the immunotoxin. Importantly, HM1.24-ETA\u2032 efficiently triggered apoptosis (>80% Annexin V positive cells) of freshly isolated plasma cell leukemia cells within 48h. In conclusion, HM1.24-ETA\u2032 efficiently triggered apoptosis of multiple myeloma cell lines as well as freshly isolated tumor cells. These results indicate that HM1.24 may represent a promising target structure for efficient antigen-specific delivery of cytotoxic compounds to plasma cell tumors.",
