    "abstract_text": "T cells carrying a \u03b3\u03b4 TCR account for less than 5% of CD3 pos T cells in healthy individuals but are key effectors of innate immunity through the recognition of some unprocessed nonpeptide antigens of both self and foreign origin. Whereas the V\u03b42 subpopulation represents more than 70% of peripheral blood \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, the V\u03b41 subset is mainly located in the mucosal tissue. Increasing evidence suggest that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have potent antitumor activity and are implicated in the defense against some haematological and epithelial malignancies. Moreover, V\u03b42 T cells constitute an attractive immunotherapy strategy since they could be expanded and activated both in vivo and in vitro using synthetic phosphoantigens and aminobiphosphonates. Such strategies are currently tested in preliminary clinical trials, notably in follicular lymphoma (FL). However, an exhaustive phenotypic and functional characterisation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in this disease, including tumor infiltration, is still lacking. We first explored the composition of FL microenvironment using a multicolour flow cytometry analysis. We observed a significant decrease in the percentage of myeloid (Lin neg CD11c pos HLADR pos ) and plasmacytoid (Lin neg CD123 pos HLADR pos ) dendritic cells (P = .0011 and P < .0001, respectively) in FL compared to normal secondary lymphoid organs. In addition, among CD3 pos T cells, the proportion of follicular helper T cells (CD4 pos CXCR5 pos ICOS hi ) was increased (P = .001) whereas regulatory T-cell (CD4 pos CD25 pos foxp3 pos ) frequency was not altered. When considering the \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell compartment, we first highlighted a reduction of the V\u03b42 subset in normal tonsils (V\u03b42 = 23.48 \u00b1 0.15% of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, n = 11) when compared with peripheral blood. Remaining non-\u03b42 \u03b3\u03b4T cells were predominantly \u03b41 T cells. More importantly, infiltrating \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were significantly decreased in lymph node biopsies from FL patients (mean = 0.48 \u00b1 0.4% of CD3 pos T cells; n = 27) when compared both to normal tonsils (mean = 2.49 \u00b1 1.6% of CD3 pos T cells; n = 33) (P < .0001) and reactive lymph nodes (mean = 2.64 \u00b1 2.6% of CD3 pos T cells; n = 9) (P = .0009). This reduction affected both the V\u03b41 and V\u03b42 T-cell subsets. The functionality of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was then assessed by the measurement of cell expansion and production of IFN-\u03b3 upon stimulation with the isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) phosphoantigen. Amplification rate in vitro reached 14.6 \u00b1 4.6 fold in tonsils (n = 10) but only 4.36 \u00b1 1.9 fold in FL samples (n = 7) (P < .002) after 5 days of culture in the presence of IPP + IL-2 + IL-15. When focusing on the \u03b42 subset, this difference was further increased with a 40-fold amplification in tonsil and a 3-fold amplification in FL samples (P = .0004). Evaluation of IFN-\u03b3 production using ELISPOT assay revealed a high heterogeneity among tumor samples since 1 to 40% of \u03b42 T cells were able to respond to IPP stimulation (n = 7). Preliminary data argued for an association between the quantity and the functionality of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in FL tumors. In conclusion, we reported an alteration of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell frequency and functionality within FL tumor niche. The next purpose will be to correlate these in vitro defects with in vivo clinical responses to immunotherapy strategies targeting \u03b3\u03b4 T cells."
