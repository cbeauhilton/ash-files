    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2576 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) involvement by leukemic blasts occurs in fewer than 10 % of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL). Leukemic meningitis is diagnosed by microscopic detection of blasts in the CSF. Flow cytometry is a highly sensitive tool for detection of aberrant cells. We sought to analyze the additional benefit flow cytometry might provide for the diagnosis of leukemic meningitis. Between 11/2007 and 8/2011, 80 patients were diagnosed with ALL and treated at Emory University. 800 CSF samples were available for analysis 80 of which were collected from a diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP), 689 from follow-up LPs and 31 from LPs obtained at the time of relapse. As shown in the table, flow cytometry confirmed the presence of leukemic blasts in one, four and five samples diagnosed with leukemic meningitis by cytology at diagnosis, different stages of treatment and relapse, respectively. One and three samples were positive for leukemic blasts by cytology but negative by flow cytometry during different treatment stages and relapse respectively. We conclude that flow cytometry provided no additional benefit to cytology in the diagnosis of leukemic meningitis. Table: CSF Cytology and Flow Cytometry in 80 Adult ALL patients:  . CSF samples . .
