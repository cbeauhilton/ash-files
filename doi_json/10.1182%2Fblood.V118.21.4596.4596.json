Our aim is to report the clinical evolution of a patient diagnosed with localized LA. Methods: Case report. Results: In May 2002, a 43-year-old gentleman presented with hoarseness and a CT scan of the neck showed a thickening of the right vocal cord with a mass that measured 2.9 \u00d7 1.2 cm in widest diameter. The patient had this mass removed surgically and the pathology showed a positive Congo red staining and a positive birefringence under polarized light, diagnostic of amyloidosis. No evidence of systemic amyloidosis or an overt B-cell lymphoma was found in this patient. Patient lost follow-up until October 2008 when he was found to have soft tissue induration around the left false vocal cord area. The biopsy showed again amyloidosis. Conclusions: LA recurrences can manifest several years after initial diagnosis. Long-term follow-up is essential. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
