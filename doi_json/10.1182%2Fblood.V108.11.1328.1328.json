    "abstract_text": "The \u03b12\u03b21 integrin, a receptor for collagen, laminin, and other matrix and non-matrix ligands, is expressed on some subsets of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Previous studies of mobilized HSC suggested that \u03b12\u03b21 integrin expression may distinguish long-term (LT-HSC) from short-term (ST-HSC) HSC. We sought to address the role of the integrin in normal hematopoiesis and following bone marrow transplant. Evaluation of mice in which the \u03b12\u03b21 integrin was genetically deleted demonstrated that peripheral blood counts, bone marrow cellularity, and bone marrow morphology were identical in \u03b12-null mice and their wild type littermate controls, suggesting that \u03b12\u03b21 integrin is not required for hematopoiesis. To further explore the role of the \u03b12\u03b21 integrin in HSC homing and engraftment, we undertook a competitive repopulation assay using a 1:1 mix of \u03b12\u03b21 \u2212/\u2212 (Ly5.2) and \u03b12\u03b21 +/+ (Ly5.1) cells transplanted into lethally irradiated Ly5.1/Ly5.2 mice. Analysis of peripheral blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes post-transplant by FACS for the detection of lineage markers (CD3, B220, CD11b, F4/80, Gr-1, NK1.1) and for expression of either CD45.1 (Ly5.1) or CD45.2 (Ly5.2), demonstrated significantly greater reconstitution with \u03b12\u03b21 \u2212/\u2212 marrow than \u03b12\u03b21 +/+ wild type marrow for lymphoid, myeloid, and monocytic lineages. The ratios ranged from 2:1(CD3, p=0.0024) \u2212 5.6:1 (F4/80, p=0.0021). Secondary transplants of bone marrow harvested from primarily reconstituted mice showed similar findings with \u03b12\u03b21 \u2212/\u2212 (Ly5.2) to \u03b12\u03b21 +/+ (Ly5.1) ratios ranging from 3.2:1 (CD3, p=0.0001) to 6.5:1 (F4/80, p<0.0001). The ratio was also altered within the HSC population (Lin \u2212 Thy lo Sca + c-kit + (LTSK)) after transplant with an \u03b12\u03b21 \u2212/\u2212 (Ly5.2) to \u03b12\u03b21 +/+ (Ly5.1) ratio of 4.63:1 (p=0.0136). To evaluate the molecular mechanisms that resulted in dramatic engraftment advantage, quantitative analysis of resting HSC in \u03b12-null and wild-type bone marrow and spleen by FACS was performed. However, no quantitative difference in the LTSK population, and no difference in LT-HSC (LSK CD34 \u2212 Flk-2 \u2212 ), ST-HSC (LSK CD34 + Flk-2 \u2212 ), or multipotent progenitors (LSK CD34 + Flk-2 + ) was identified. FACS analysis of \u03b14\u03b21 expression showed no increase in \u03b14\u03b21 expression in a2-null HSC compared to wild-type, indicating that \u03b12-null HSC do not compensate with upregulation of \u03b14\u03b21 expression. Homing assays using CFSE labeled \u03b12-null or wild-type bone marrow transplanted into lethally irradiated \u03b12-null or wild type recipients showed no difference in homing, regardless of the donor or recipient genotype. Although HSC numbers were the same, methylcellulose cultures for hematopoietic progenitors showed significantly greater numbers of CFU-C for \u03b12-null bone marrow compared to wild-type (p=0.0067), suggesting either a proliferative advantage or heightened sensitivity to growth factors present in the media. Immunohistochemical analysis of bone marrow from \u03b12-null and wild-type mice for Ki-67 showed significantly greater proliferation in the wild-type compared to \u03b12-null bone marrow. These studies suggest that although \u03b12\u03b21 integrin is not required for normal hematopoiesis, the integrin may play important roles in regulation of HSC proliferation as well as maintenance of the HSC niche.",
