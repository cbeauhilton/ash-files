    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2768 Background: 24-month follow-up of pts with newly diagnosed CML-CP in the DASISION trial demonstrated both a high rate of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) with dasatinib (D) and higher and faster rates of major molecular response (MMR) with D over imatinib (IM), supporting the use of D 100 mg once daily as a first-line treatment option for newly diagnosed CML-CP. Discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) occurred in 7% with D and 5% with IM. Median dose intensity for D and IM were 99.5 mg/day and 400 mg/day, respectively (Kantarjian JCO 2011:29;Abs 6510). A retrospective analysis of pts from DASISION was performed to evaluate the impact of dose reductions and interruptions due to AEs on efficacy of D or IM in newly diagnosed CML-CP. Methods: Pts with newly diagnosed CML-CP received D 100 mg QD (N=258) or IM 400 mg QD (N=258). The primary endpoint was confirmed CCyR by 12 months. In DASISION, up to two dose reductions were permitted for AEs; dose reduction levels were 80 mg/50 mg for D and 300 mg/200 mg for IM. Dose interruptions were permitted for management of AEs. Upon resolution or improvement of AEs to \u2264 Grade 1, pts could resume therapy at an appropriate dose based on initial severity of the AE. Efficacy was evaluated for pts with or without dose reductions and/or interruptions due to AEs at any time. Efficacy was also evaluated for pts with first dose interruption and/or reduction due to AEs within \u22646 or >6 months of their first dose who remained on treatment for at least 6 months, in order to reduce selection bias of pts with longer duration of therapy. Pts with dose reduction and/or interruption for reasons other than AEs (dosing error, medical procedure) were excluded from all analyses. Results: 134 D pts (52%) and 92 IM pts (36%) had dose reduction and/or interruption for AE management at the DASISION 24-month update. First dose reduction and/or interruption due to non-hematologic AEs occurred in 59 (23%) D and 40 (16%) IM pts and hematologic AEs in 75 (29%) D and 52 (20%) IM pts. Pts with dose reduction and/or interruption for reasons other than AE management were excluded, including 21 (8%) D pts and 19 (7%) IM pts. The median duration of first dose interruption due to AEs was approximately 2 weeks on both arms. CCyR and MMR rates with D were comparable whether pts did or did not have their dose reduced and/or interrupted at any time (Table). D pts who had dose reduction and/or interruption had generally higher rates of responses than IM pts overall and in those without an IM dose reduction and/or interruption. The timing of dose reduction and/or interruption appeared to have a potential impact as response rates were higher when dose reduction and/or interruption occurred >6 months after the first dose of either drug (Table). CCyR and MMR rates with D remained higher than with IM when dose reduction and/or interruption occurred \u22646 months from first dose. Similarly, both CCyR and MMR were higher for D than with IM if dose reduction and/or interruption occurred >6 months from the first dose. Conclusions: Results of this analysis suggest that CML-CP pts receiving dasatinib achieved similar response rates despite dose modification for the management of AEs. Data for pts with and without dose reduction and/or interruption due to AEs are consistent with DASISION 24-months results, showing higher rates of response with dasatinib than with imatinib.  .
