    "abstract_text": "In the bone marrow (BM), hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (HSC/P) reside in specific anatomical niches. Among these niches, a functional osteoblast (Ob)-macrophage (M\u03a6) niche has been described where Ob and M\u03a6 (so called \"osteomacs\") are in direct relationship. A connection between innate immunity surveillance and traffic of hematopoietic stem cells/progenitors (HSC/P) has been demonstrated but the regulatory signals that instruct immune regulation from M\u03a6 and Ob on HSC/P circulation are unknown. The adaptor protein sequestosome 1 (Sqstm1), contains a Phox bemp1 (PB1) domain which regulates signal specificities through PB1-PB1 scaffolding and processes of autophagy. Using microenvironment and osteoblast-specific mice deficient in Sqstm1, we discovered that the deficiency of Sqstm1 results in macrophage contact-dependent activation of Ob IKK/NF-\u03baB, in vitro and in vivo repression of Ccl4 (a CCR5 binding chemokine that has been shown to modulate microenvironment Cxcl12-mediated responses of HSC/P), HSC/P egress and deficient BM homing of wild-type HSC/P. Interestingly, while Ccl4 expression is practically undetectable in wild-type or Sqstm1 -/- Ob, primary Ob co-cultured with wild-type BM-derived M\u03a6 strongly upregulate Ccl4 expression, which returns to normal levels upon genetic deletion of Ob Sqstm1. We discovered that M\u03a6 can activate an inflammatory pathway in wild-type Ob which include upregulation of activated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK), I\u03baB kinase (IKK), nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB and Ccl4 expression through direct cell-to-cell interaction. Sqstm1 -/- Ob cocultured with M\u03a6 strongly upregulated p-IKB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB activity, downregulated Ccl4 expression and secretion and repressed osteogenesis. Forced expression of Sqstm1, but not of an oligomerization-deficient mutant, in Sqstm1 -/- Ob restored normal levels of p-IKB\u03b1, NF-\u03baB activity, Ccl4 expression and osteogenic differentiation, indicating that Sqstm1 dependent Ccl4 expression depends on localization to the autophagosome formation site. Finally, Ob Sqstm1 deficiency results in upregulation of Nbr1, a protein containing a PB1 interacting domain. Combined deficiency of Sqstm1 and Nbr1 rescues all in vivo and in vitro phenotypes of Sqstm1 deficiency related to osteogenesis and HSC/P egression in vivo. Together, this data indicated that Sqstm1 oligomerization and functional repression of its PB1 binding partner Nbr1 are required for Ob dependent Ccl4 production and HSC/P retention, resulting in a functional signaling network affecting at least three cell types. A functional \u2018M\u03a6-Ob niche\u2019 is required for HSC/P retention where Ob Sqstm1 is a negative regulator of M\u03a6 dependent Ob NF-\u03baB activation, Ob differentiation and BM HSC/P traffic to circulation.
