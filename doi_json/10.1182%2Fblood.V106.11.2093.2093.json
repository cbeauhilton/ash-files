    "abstract_text": "Thirty six patients (pts) with NHL, aged 3.5\u201320.9 years (median 14.7 years) received an allo-SCT (n=21) or auto-SCT (n=15) at our institution between 12/82 and 12/04. Pathologic NHL classification included: lymphoblastic (n=12), Burkitt\u2019s (n=5), Large Cell (n=17) including ki-1 + (n=11), peripheral NHL (n=1), and undifferentiated NHL (n=1). Disease status at SCT was: first remission (CR1) (n=1), CR2 (n=15), CR3 (n=5), partial remission (n=7), relapse (Rel) or refractory (Ref) (n=8). Cytoreductive regimens were total body irradiation (TBI)-based for all but 3 pts in each of the allo-SCT and auto-SCT group. For the allo-SCT pts, donors were: matched related (n=15), mismatched related (n=1), and unrelated (n=5); graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis included T-cell depletion (TCD) (n=10) or post-BMT immunosuppression (n=11). Only one pt received a non-myeloablative allo-SCT. With one pt in the allo-SCT group lost to follow-up, 35 of 36 pts in the entire cohort were evaluable. The median follow up of the entire group was 21.5 months; it was 34 months and 20 months respectively for the allo-SCT and the auto-SCT groups. The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 56% and 54%, respectively. Ten of the 11 pts with ki-1 positive NHL are alive, disease-free after either allo-SCT (n=4) or auto-SCT (n=7) with a median follow-up of 26 months. The DFS for those patients transplanted in CR was 60% compared to 49% for those transplanted in either PR or Rel/Ref disease. Of the eight pts transplanted with progressive disease, 2 are alive, disease-free at 110 and 115 months; both pts post allo-SCT. For the allo-SCT group, the DFS was 52%. Seven pts relapsed, 4 of whom had Rel/Ref disease at the time of SCT. Four pts died of SCT-related complications. Five pts developed Grade II\u2013IV aGvHD. For the auto-SCT group, the DFS was 53%. Two pts relapsed, and 2 pts died of toxicity. In summary, both allo-SCT and auto-SCT offer the prospect of durable disease-free survival for a significant proportion of pediatric patients with NHL after a first relapse or disease progression. In particular, those pts with ki-1-positive NHL had the most favorable outcome. As expected, pts transplanted in minimal residual disease achieved superior DFS. Results  . N . CR/PR . Rel/Ref .
