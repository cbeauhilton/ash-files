    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4337 The results of treatment of adults with ALL remain unsatisfactory. Pediatric-inspired treatments seem to be related with better outcomes. Eighty adult ALL patients were prospectively treated in a single institution in a 16-year period with a schedule based on the St. Jude's TOTAL XI pediatric protocol employing vincristine, prednisone, asparaginase, daunorubicin, etoposide, cytarabine, methotrexate, mercaptopurine and triple intratecal therapy. Median age was 31 years (range 18 \u2013 86); 92% were B-cell malignancies and 14% were Ph1 (+). Ten patients did not complete the first course of chemotherapy and 4 exited early. 44 of 66 patents (67%) achieved a complete remission; relapses presented in 57%. The median probability of overall survival (OS) was 28 months, whereas the 144-month OS was 27%. The median probability of leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 28 months, and the 144-month LFS 35%. Ph1 (+) patients did worse than Ph1-negative and T-cell leukemias did better than B-cell ones. Concerning toxicity, eight patients had toxic deaths (12%), two developed acute pancreatitis and one secondary diabetes. This pediatric-inspired therapy rendered better results than those obtained in similar socioeconomic circumstances using adult-oriented treatments; tolerance was acceptable and costs were low since it employs affordable drugs and can be delivered as outpatients.
