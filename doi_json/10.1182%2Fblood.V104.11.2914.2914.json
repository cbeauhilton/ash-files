    "abstract_text": "Imatinib mesylate (imatinib, Gleevec\u00ae, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) inhibits T cells in vitro and in vivo ( Dietz et al., Blood  104 : 1094 \u20131099, 2004 ; Cwynarski et al., Leukemia  18 : 1332 \u20131339, 2004 ). The drug blocks T cell cycle progression rather uniquely as it neither inhibits expression of CD69, an early marker of T cell activation, nor induces apoptosis. To characterize the molecular effects of imatinib leading to this mode of T-cell inhibition, we measured the changes in transcriptome (by Affymetrix U133 chips), proteome and phosphoproteome (by Western blotting, differential phosphoprotein expression and mass spectrometry). We found that phytohemagglutinin activated T cells pre-treated with imatinib had reduced expression of 983 transcripts and increased expression of 271 transcripts when compared to untreated PHA activated T cells by the factor of 1.5 or more (p<0.05). Among the prominently down-regulated transcripts were granzyme B, CTLA-4 and IL-2-receptor \u03b1-chain (CD25), all characteristic of activated T cells, as well as cyclins D2 and D3 and cyclin-dependent kinases 3, 4 and 7, the molecules regulating cell cycle progression. Among the up-regulated transcripts were Kruppel-like transcription factors 2 and 7, and p27, a finding compatible with the observed cell cycle inhibition. Furthermore, we selected and identified 30 proteins from 2-D gels that were up-regulated and/or hyperphosphorylated in imatinib treated activated T cells. Among these were four heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins, three lamins and \u03b3-actin, all components of the nucleoskeleton at the interface of chromatin and inner nuclear membrane and involved in replication and transcription ( Herrmann and Foisner, Cell. Mol. Life Sci.  60 : 1607 \u20131612, 2003 ; Shumaker et al. Curr. Opinion Cell Biol.  15 : 358 \u2013366, 2003 ). Thus, imatinib-borne interference with T cell signal transduction affects the nuclear structure indicating for the first time that nucleoskeleton structural changes are associated with T cell activation status.",
