    "abstract_text": "Lineage specific transcription factors play essential roles in regulation of hematopoietic development. Transcription factor abnormalities have been frequently described in acute leukemia, mostly through cytogenetic changes. Nevertheless, point mutations can be easily missed. Recently, mutations in the erythroid and megakaryocyte specific transcription factor GATA1 have been discovered in patients with dyserythropoietic anemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AML-M7) with Down syndrome. Besides GATA-1, located on the X-chromosome, point mutations have been described in biallelic genes. This is the case of AML1 (RUNX1). PU1 and C/EBPalpha also represent examples of transcription factors in which point mutations are found in leukemia. A new zinc finger transcription factor involved in erythropoiesis is Gfi1b. Gfi1b was recently identified by sequence homology with oncogene Gfi1. Gfi1b knockout has demonstrated that this gene is essential for development of both erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages, and in its absence no enucleated erythrocytes are produced. Several Gfi1b DNA and protein targets (GATA1, Gfi1, AML1, p21WAF1, IL-6 Socs1 and Socs2) have been described that might be involved in malignancy. These findings indicate that Gfi1b is at the centre of hematopoiesis and may be a good candidate gene to be involved in hematological abnormalities. We have searched for Gfi1b point mutations in 122 patients with acute leukemia of all FAB types at diagnosis or relapse and 9 cases of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia. We have amplified Gfi1b promoter, coding and non-coding exons ( Nucleic Acids Res  2004 ; 32 : 3935 \u201346 , MN 004188) by high fidelity PCR and screen for point mutations through dHPLC (Wave, Transgenomic) followed by sequencing of the cases with abnormal pattern. SNIPs in the promoter and exons were further confirmed in at least another PCR, cloned in pGEM-T easy vector system (Promega) and sequenced. Alleles with promoter SNIPs were cloned in pGL3-Enhancer vector (Promega), and transiently cotransfected with pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) to K562 cells. Luciferase activity was determined with Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega). We found two promoter SNIPs in sequences conserved from chicken to human, one of them affecting a GATA-1 site, reducing promoter in vitro activity by 60 and 50% respectively. We also discovered a congenital exonic SNIP causing a mammalian conserved serine change to leucine. We excluded these to be frequent polymorphisms by dHPLC analysis of 96 blood donors. Although we cannot at present establish a clear relation between the former SNIPS and leukemia, we will discuss the presence of other milder hematological abnormalities. So far this is the first report of Gfi1b mutations that can be related to human pathology.",
