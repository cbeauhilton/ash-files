    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Stem cell (SC) based therapy in ischemic heart disease is actually in development with the aim of improving cardiac regeneration. The way of administration, source of SC and the mechanisms of its clinical effects are yet not well defined. We present preliminary results of a group of patients treated with laser revascularization and autologous bone marrow (BM) cells administration, evaluating cells immunophenotype and clinical results. Patients and methods: Fourteen patients (57\u201378 y) with diffuse coronary disease and medically refractory class III/IV angina were prospectively evaluated for cell-based therapy combined with laser transmyocardial revascularization (TMR) PHOENIX-TM (Cardiogenesis, Irvine, CA, USA). BM mononuclear cells (MC), were obtained by BM aspiration (120 mL) and processed for concentration using HARVEST-TM system (Harvest Technologies Inc. GMBH, Munich). Immunophenotypic characterization of the final infused product was performed by standard four-color flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies directed against the human surface antigens CD29, CD49a, CD105, CD106, CD117, CD34, CD133 and CD45, to evaluate different cell populations. Results and conclusions: Patients received a median of 56.8\u00d710 6 (43.7\u201379) BMMC/ mL 0.5\u00d710 6 (0.05\u20131) CD34+ cells/mL and 0.23\u00d710 6 (0.001\u20130.7) CD133+ cells/mL. All the patients are alive after this treatment: median of 9 months, (1\u201315), with improvement of their cardiological clinical status and QoL. As observed (Table 1) the BMMC used in the therapy contained a significant proportion of CD133+ and CD34+ hematopoietic SC. In addition, the samples contained cells with CD105+ CD45\u2212 or CD29+ CD45\u2212 CD34\u2212 phenotypes which have been described as mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Bone marrow CD106+ positive cells represent a multipotent subpopulation of MSC including endotelial. Correlation between the relative quantity of the different cell subsets and clinical results of the patients will be presented. TABLE 1  . CD34 . CD133 . CD117 . CD29 . CD49a . CD105 . CD106 .
