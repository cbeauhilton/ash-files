    "abstract_text": "Expression of the common leukocyte antigen, CD45 is quite variable in human myeloma cells and cell lines, such as U266, and CD45 + U266 proliferates in response to a growth factor, interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6 as a mitogenic stimulus, activated a src family kinase, Lyn and phospholipase C (PLC)-g2 followed by Ca 2+ influxes and protein kinase C (PKC) activation in CD45 + U266. Here we show that compared with CD45 \u2212 U266, CD45 + U266 was more sensitive to various apoptotic stimuli, such as oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress. Both release of apoptosis-inducing factor or cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 were enhanced in CD45 + U266 more than in CD45 \u2212 U266. Increased susceptibility to the stress-induced apoptosis was also observed in other CD45-expressing myeloma cell lines and the CD45-transfected U266. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) seem to be involved in the susceptibility to apoptosis of CD45 + U266 because either an anti-oxidant, DTT or a Ca 2+ chelating agent, BAPTA blocked the apoptosis. As the oxidative stress-induced Ca 2+ influxes and apoptosis of CD45 + U266 were blocked by a src family kinase inhibitor, PP2, CD45 phosphatase regulating the src family kinase activity plays an important role in the augmented apoptosis in CD45 + U266 by oxidative stress. The intracellular accumulation of ROS may activate src associated with CD45, and the activated src kinases accelerate the Ca 2+ influxes followed by calicineurin activation, mitochondrial translocation of Bad, and inhibition of Bcl-2 function. These results indicate that the CD45-expression renders myeloma cells competent with not only mitogenic but also apoptotic stimuli, resulting in either proliferation or apoptosis of CD45 + myeloma cells dependently upon the stimuli. Furthermore, voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC)-1 was identified as a gene highly expressed in CD45 + U266 by cDNA subtraction. The increased expression of VDAC-1 seemed to augment the sensitivity to the ER-stress because the VDAC-1-transfected CD45 \u2212 U266 was confirmed to be susceptible to the thapsigargin-induced apoptosis. Thus, CD45 may define the signaling thresholds that are critical for the IL-6-induced proliferation and the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of myeloma cells, and the CD45 expression accompanied by the increased VDAC-1 expression sensitizes myeloma cells to the various extracellular stimuli triggering apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathways.",
