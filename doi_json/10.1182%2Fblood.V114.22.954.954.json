    "abstract_text": "Abstract 954 Introduction: Multiple myeloma (MM), a malignancy of plasma cells, remains incurable even though newly established regimens incorporating conventional and novel agents are capable of achieving complete clinical and biochemical remissions in a sizeable subset of MM patients. This indicates the presence of a distinctive drug-resistant sub-population of MM cells, which might be responsible for tumor re-growth. Methods and Results: To evaluate this phenomenon, we performed flow cytometry-based Hoechst 33342 staining assay to evaluate the existence and characteristics in MM of a population known as side population (SP), which has been identified in diverse neoplasias and has been reported to exhibit \u201cstem-like\u201d features. We specifically performed flow cytometry or ImageStream analyses to quantify the SP population in a panel of 18 MM cell lines. These analyses revealed heterogeneity in the proportion of SP fractions in different cell lines and indicated the lack of correlation between CD138 expression and SP fraction. We observed that, after sorting of the SP and non-SP fractions, SP cells have the potential to generate colonies in CFU assays, and regenerate a population resembling the original, pre-sorted, one. Moreover, SP cells had a high proliferation index compared to non-SP cells. We also observed that most MM cells lines express significantly higher levels of ABCG2 transcripts in their sorted SP fraction compared to their non-SP cells. The mRNA profile results were further corroborated by functional assays, where SP cells showed more pronounced efflux of the known ABCG2 substrate mitoxantrone, consistent with the association of SP phenotype with ABCG2 expression. Interestingly, at concentrations and durations of drug exposure that did not substantially affect the viability of non-SP cells, the immunomodulatory thalidomide derivative (IMiDs) lenalidomide significantly decreased the percentage and clonogenicity of SP cells. This response was accompanied by a distinct pattern of changes in diverse signaling pathways in SP cells (including phosphorylation changes in Akt, GSK-3a/b, MEK1, c-Jun, p53, p38 MAPK, p70S6K and STAT3) and increase of CD138 -/low+ phenotype. Because the BM microenvironment is considered a key regulator of MM cell biological behavior, we evaluated the impact of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) on the behavior of SP cells and observed that BMSCs led to increased percentage, viability, as well as proliferation potential of SP cells. Interestingly, IMiDs abrogated this stimulatory effect of stromal cells by significantly decreasing SP cell percentages. In these co-culture models, we identified several cytokines, including IL-1b, IL-10, IL-17; chemokines (MIP-1a, MIP-1b and IP-10) and growth factors such as GM-CSF and VEGF, which were up-regulated in co-culture MM cells with stromal cells compared to stroma alone or MM cells alone. Significant modulation in the production of these cytokines and chemokines was detected after IMiD treatment of MM cells only, as well as in co-culture model. Conclusion: Identifying the clonogenic population of SP cells could facilitate the development of new strategies targeting subpopulations of MM cells with drug resistant properties. Our study raises the intriguing possibility that IMiDs could represent such a strategy that can target SP cells and counteract their resistance to different conventional, and perhaps some novel, therapies. In addition, our data suggest that further studies of this tumor cell population are warranted towards to the goal of developing new strategies to treat MM.
