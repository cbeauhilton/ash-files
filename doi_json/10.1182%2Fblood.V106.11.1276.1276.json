    "abstract_text": "Mesenchymal stem cells have been implicated as playing an important role in stem cell engraftment. A new pluripotent population of umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived Unrestricted Somatic Stem Cells (USSCs), with intrinsic and directable potential to develop into mesodermal, endodermal and ectodermal fates, has recently been identified and characterized ( 1 ). In this study we evaluated the capacity of USSCs to influence the homing of UCB -derived CD34+ cells into the marrow and spleen of NOD/SCID mice. Cultured USSCs were co-transplanted with CFDA-labeled cord blood CD34+ cells into sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice. Femurs and spleens were harvested 16 hrs thereafter and the percentage of CD34+ cells determined by flow cytometry. USSCs induced a significant enhancement of CD34+ cell homing to both bone marrow and spleen (2.2 \u00b1 0.3 and 2.4 \u00b1 0.6 -fold, respectively; p<0.05). Similar findings were obtained with frozen USSC samples that had been thawed prior to transplantation. The effect of USSCs was specific, as no homing enhancement could be observed by co-transplantation of CD34+ cells with lineage-positive UCB cells, which contain T, B and mature myelo-erythroid cells. Enhanced marrow homing by USSCs was unaltered by extensive culture passaging of the cells, with a similar degree of enhancement observed for both early (p5) and late (p10) passage USSCs (1.7 \u00b1 0.1 and 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 -fold, respectively). Enhanced homing was dose-dependent, detectable at USSC/CD34+ ratios of 1:1 and above. USSCs were also found to enhance the homing of day 14 cells harvested from cultures of selectively amplified TM , ex-vivo expanded UCB lineage-negative (lin-) cells. The relative proportion of homing CD34+ cells within the culture-expanded cell population, was unaffected by USSC co-transplantation. Our findings thus demonstrate that USSCs enhance the homing of UCB hematopoietic stem cells and suggest a clinical potential for these cells in facilitating engraftment under conditions of limiting cord blood stem cell numbers.",
