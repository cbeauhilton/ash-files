    "article_date": "November 1, 2006",
    "session_type": "Poster Sessions",
    "abstract_text": "We have utilised aCGH (Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre 5.8K array) and mutational analysis of the TP53 gene (exons 4\u201310) on 74 cases of CLL to define the extent of deletion at 17p, TP53 mutational status, additional genomic changes, and how this affects clinical outcome. 17p- cases were selected by FISH (n=37, Vysis LSI P53 probe) and 37 cases were selected as being representative of the survival curve of CLL patients without 17p-. FISH identified 22 cases with TP53- in \u2265 50% of cells, 4 cases with TP53- 20\u201350% and 11 cases with TP53- \u2264 20%. aCGH can detect abnormalities present in >50% of cells and all of the TP53- cases greater than 50% by FISH were detected with deletion ranging between 6-20Mb in length, the majority encompassing the entire p-arm. In addition aCGH detected deletion of 17p in 5/15 cases with TP53- 20% have a poor clinical outcome (median survival 11 months, median progression free survival 3 months), the majority of these (85%) also have a mutation of TP53 whereas in cases with \u2264 20% 17p- only 10% were mutated. The 17p- group was characterised by additional recurrent deletions involving 18p, 20p and 22q, which tended to occur as single additional events. Understanding the order in which these events occur is important, 18p- was found in 6 cases, 2 of which had <50% 17p- by FISH, suggesting that 18p- is present in a higher percentage of cells and by implication occurs prior to the 17p deletion, a similar finding was also present for the 20p- cases. 18p deletion varied in length between 5.9Mb and 12Mb, with the minimally deleted region (MDR) involving a 2.5Mb region spanning 18p11.23-p11.22. 20p- was found in 8 cases of which 3 covered almost the entire p-arm, and 5 formed 2 clusters at each end of the p-arm. 22q- was found in 8 cases, with only 1 outside of the 17p- group. Out of these 8 cases with deletion, 6 covered almost the complete q-arm but a MDR was difficult to define, however if the non-17p- case is excluded the MDR covers 1.4Mb at 22q12.3. Recurrent abnormalities were also found on other chromosomes, but did not differ between the two groups. These included regions with previously identified abnormalities; trisomy 12 (n=11), loss of 6q14.1\u201324.3 (n=11), loss of 11q12.1\u201325 (n=17) and loss of 13q12.1\u201321.1 (n=6) as well as detection of novel abnormalities; gain of 4p16.3\u201316.1 (n=23), gain of 11p15.5\u201315.3 (n=22), gain of 22q11.21\u201313.33 (n=22) and deletions on chromosome 9 (n=9). These results show that deletion of TP53 and mutation of the other allele are critical adverse prognostic factors. We have also defined a genetic background (18p-, 20p- and 22q-) on which these changes arise.",
