    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3753 Immunotherapy with TCR or chimeric receptor-genetically modified T cells may result in toxicity related to direct target effects, unanticipated off-target effects or lymphoproliferation due to insertional mutagenesis. Therefore it is required to include a suicide gene in the viral vector. We compared different suicide genes in vitro in Epstein Barr Virus-specific cytotoxic T cells (EBV-CTL). Herpes Simplex Virus Thymidine Kinase (HSV-tk), human inducible Caspase 9 (iCasp9), human CD20 and mutant human thymidylate kinase (mTMPK) genes were cloned in frame with truncated CD34 (dCD34, marker gene), separated by the 2A peptide in a SFG-based vector. We previously reported with the iCasp9-coding construct, a lower transduction efficiency and instable expression of the dCD34 marker gene. We therefore codon-optimized the iCasp9 sequence (iCasp9opt) and repeated the cloning in frame with 2A-dCD34 in the SFG vector. EBV-CTLs could be similarly and efficiently transduced with iCasp9opt-2A-dCD34, HSV-TK-2A-dCD34, mTMPK-2A-dCD34 and CD20-2A-dCD34 (mean % CD34 + , 80%, n=5), similarly to the control vector containing dCD34 alone. Expression of the marker gene was stable up to 3 weeks. Expression of the suicide genes was not associated with alterations in the expansion rate, immunophenotype and capacity to kill autologous lymphoblastoid cell lines. Transduced and CD34-selected EBV-CTLs have been tested for their sensibility to the corresponding activator in vitro by evaluating residual CD34 + cells. iCasp9opt- transduced cells were rapidly killed with high efficiency by CID, (mean survival, 11% after 24 hours, and 5% after 7 days; n=7). Gancyclovir treated HSV-tk expressing cells showed similar levels of efficacy only after 3 days and CD20 and mTMPK-transduced cells showed only minimal killing at all time points (mean survival after 7 days,84% and 32% respectively).The same results were obtained by analyzing apoptosis induction through Annexin-7AAD staining. In fact, after 24 hours of incubation with CID, nearly 100% iCasp9opt + cells were apoptotic, whereas a significant lower % of apoptotic cells was observed with the other suicide genes. Altogether our results suggest that the faster activity of iCasp9 might be advantageous in case of occurring severe toxicity, and, together with its lack of immunogenicity and the absence of side-effects of CID, support the clinical applicability of iCap9-based suicide strategy.
