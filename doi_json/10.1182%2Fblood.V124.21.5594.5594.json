    "abstract_text": "Background: De-ubiquitinating enzyme BAP1, a fundamental deubiquitinase in the epigenetic regulation of transcription factors and functionally related to ASXL1, is mutated in a hereditary cancer syndrome with increased risk of mesothelioma and uveal melanoma. In a recent murine study, absolute BAP1 depletion generated specimens with similar characteristics to myelodysplastic / myeloproliferative syndromes in humans (ineffective hematopoiesis and myeloproliferation), mainly to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (Dey, et al. Science 2012). Aim: The aim of this study was to quantify BAP1 gene expression in patients diagnosed with a variety of myeloid neoplasms, and compared it with healthy donors. We furthermore explored the possible association of BAP1 low expression level and the presence of ASXL1 mutations or BRCA1 protein levels. In addition, a regression analysis to determine the possible correlation of peripheral blood and bone marrow expression levels was performed. Methods: We included patients diagnosed between 2008-2014 of CMML, myelodysplastic sydrome (MDS) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), of whom bone marrow DNA and RNA were available at diagnosis. As controls, 6 healthy bone marrow donors were used. BAP1 and BRCA1 expressions levels were quantified by RT-qPCR, using the same healthy bone marrow donor sample as an inter-assay normalizing- calibrator. The study of somatic ASXL1 mutations was carried out by the Sanger method. For statistical studies, the T-Student, Pearson correlation and/or U Mann-Whitney test, were used when needed. For survival analysis COX regression and the ROC curves were used. A two-side P<0.05 was used as statistical significance threshold. Results: Samples of 116 patients were included in the study: CMML=26; MDS=15; AML=50; CML=25 and 6 controls. This study shows that levels of BAP1 expressions are decreased when compared to controls along the spectrum of myeloid diseases. In the comparison among entities, CMML shows the lowest values (percentage respect to the calibrator), significantly lower than the other groups, except for CML patients: CMML vs MDS, p=0.001; CMML vs AML, p<0.001; CMML vs Controls, p<0.001; LMMC vs CML, p=0.346. No differences were found between CMML patients with dysplastic and myeloproliferative variant, WHO types I and II or according to the presence of ASXL1 mutations (33% CMML patients were mutated). Of potential clinical interest, BAP1 expression in bone marrow and peripheral blood showed a direct and significant correlation ( r=0.884, p= 0.001). BRCA1 expression were decreased uniformly through the different myeloid diseases, suggesting that the heterogeneous BAP1 expression could be responsible for different BRCA1 protein levels by posttranslational regulation. Conclusion:In summary; this study shows that BAP1 decreased expression is a common mechanism among the myeloid malignances, being CMML mainly affected. This mechanism is independent of the presence of ASXL1 mutations, and it could constitute a new therapeutic target in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
