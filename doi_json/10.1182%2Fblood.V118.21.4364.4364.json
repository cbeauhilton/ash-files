The question is: Are there any differences of a serial D-dimer level if is compared to the APAs level?. Methods. A retrospective Cohort study was conducted on a total sampling subjects of pregnancy women who visited two hospitals in Jakarta, Indonesia, at a periode of January 2009 \u2013 December 2010. Serial D-dimer using chromogenic assay method (cut off normal level < 500 ng/ml) was tested during antenatal and post partum period. The data were analysed to compare a mean D-dimer with the level of APAs (ACA IgG/IgM, AntiB2GP1 IgG/IgM) tested using ELISA method Results Of 83 pregnant women , 19 women with high level of APAs (group 1) showed a mean D-dimer level as follows: Trimester I: 892.15 \u00b1 785.15 ng/ml, trimester II: 782.59 \u00b1 440.53 ng/ml, trimester III:1282.62 \u00b1 601.22 ng/ml, post partum 1367.45 \u00b1 581.19 ng/ml; 31 women with normal APAs (group 2) showed: Trimester I: 666.23 \u00b1 396.24 ng/ml, trimester II: 896.66 \u00b1 396.24 ng/ml, trimester II: 896.66 \u00b1 496.32 ng/ml, trimester III: 1313.45 \u00b1 850.20 ng/ml, post partum: 1991.75 \u00b1 1388.70 ng/ml; 33 women with no data of APAs (group 3) showed: Trimester I: 568.47 \u00b1 482.70 ng/ml, trimester 2: 797.95 \u00b1 934.59 ng/ml, trimester III: 966.89 \u00b1 862.10 ng/ml, post partum: 1078.50 \u00b1 836.29 ng/ml Conclusion Either in group 1, 2, and 3 mean D-dimer tend to increase from trimester I to trimester II and from trimester II to trimester III, except in group 1 from trimester I to trimester II of pregnancy. Meanwhile, all groups showed a higher mean D-dimer post partum compared to antenatal period. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
