    "abstract_text": "Background: The optimal therapy for relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) after arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 )-induced remission is unclear. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Moreover, lasting remission is observed in many patients who are not candidates for HSCT, owing to advanced age or lack of donors, implying that HSCT is not mandatory for durable remission. We evaluated our results of an As 2 O 3 -based, non-HSCT regimen for patients with relapsed APL. Materials and methods: Forty-two consecutive patients (18 men, 24 women, median age: 35 years, 12\u201372) with relapsed (relapse 1, R1=39, R2=3) APL were treated with an-As 2 O 3 based, non-HSCT regimen. The time from last complete remission (CR) was 22 (6\u2013243) months (mo). Initial treatment was As 2 O 3 (10 mg/day) either intravenously (n=16) or orally (n=28) until CR, followed by idarubicin consolidation (6 mg/m 2 /day x 9). Twenty-five patients received oral-As 2 O 3 maintenance. Post-As 2 O 3 relapses were treated with oral As 2 O 3 + all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, 45 mg/m 2 /day) until CR, followed by maintenance (two weeks of ATRA+As 2 O 3 every 2 mo. for 2 years). Post-As 2 O 3 /ATRA relapses were treated with oral As 2 O 3 +ATRA+ascorbic acid (1g/day) until CR, followed by consolidation/maintenance with the same regimen (2 weeks every 2 mo. for 2 years). Part of the induction and all of the maintenance therapies were given in the outpatient clinic. Results: Forty-one patients (98%) achieved CR after initial As 2 O 3 treatment. One 72-year old man with XYY syndrome, diabetes and mental retardation died of pneumonia. Thirteen relapses occurred at a median of 15 (6\u201322) mo. As 2 O 3 -maintenance significantly decreased further relapses (3/24 with versus 10/17 without As 2 O 3 -maintenance, p=0.003). Two relapses died of cerebral APL before further treatment could be administered. Of eleven patients treated with As 2 O 3 +ATRA, 10 achieved CR, 8 of whom have remained in remission (median follow-up: 33 mo.). Two post-As 2 O 3 /ATRA relapses achieved CR again with As 2 O 3 +ATRA+ascorbic acid, and have remained in remission after maintenance treatment with As 2 O 3 +ATRA+ascorbic acid. All patients in continuous remission (n=38) were PML/RARa negative on polymerase chain reaction (sensitivity 10 \u22123 to 10 \u22124 ). Conclusion: Our regimen resulted in a leukemia-free-survival of 89.3%. The results suggest that an oral and mainly outpatient As 2 O 3 -based, non-HSCT strategy is efficacious for relapsed APL. In terms of survival, costs, treatment side effects and patient tolerance, the results appear to be comparable to, if not more favorable than, other treatment options based on high dose chemotherapy, graft-versus-leukemia effect, or anti-myeloid antibody therapy.",
