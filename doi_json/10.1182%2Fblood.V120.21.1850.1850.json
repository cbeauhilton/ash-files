    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1850 The use of the word cure when discussing MM therapy remains taboo. Albeit most investigators applaud the enormous improvement in clinical outcomes ushered in initially by autotransplant-supported high-dose melphalan. Additionally, the introduction of novel agents inaugurated with thalidomide and followed by bortezomib and lenalidomide have continued a course towards a cure status. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) are particularly poor with GEP-defined high-risk MM. Here we have examined whether, due to much earlier data maturation in high-risk MM, a fraction of long-term progression-free survivors can be discerned. This fraction of patients not susceptible to progression is consistent with the concept of cure. Here, we use a logistic/Weibull mixture model to estimate the proportion of long-term progression-free survivors. TT2 and TT3 results have been reported previously. We estimated 4-yr rates of OS, PFS and continuous CR (CCR) in TT2's control arm (TT2-), TT2's thalidomide arm (TT2+), TT3A (with VTD maintenance) and TT3B (with VRD maintenance) ( Table 1 ). Progressive improvement in all 3 endpoints were noted with transition from TT2- to TT2+ and further to TT3A/B among the \u201cany high risk feature\u201d cohort and especially for GEP-70-defined high risk. Next we applied the logistic/Weilbull mixture model revealing progressive increments in predicted fractions of long-term PFS ( Table 2  ). These data are depicted graphically with p-values in Figure 1 . We also examined relative survival rates for patients who remain PFS after 3yr in the context of age and gender matched survival for the general population ( Figure 2 ). These observations are compatible with a finite cure rate in high-risk myeloma. Data will be presented on gene probes of plasma cells and whole bone marrow biopsies, which may define at a baseline status, candidates with high cure potential. Table 1.
