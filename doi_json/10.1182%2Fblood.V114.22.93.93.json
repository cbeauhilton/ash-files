    "abstract_text": "Abstract 93 Lymphomagenesis is a complex process, in part reflecting the nature of the transforming event, as well as the developmental stage of the cell. In the B-cell differentiation represents a continuum that is initiated when a nai\u0308ve B-cell encounters antigen, undergoes a germinal centre (GC) reaction and ends with terminal differentiation into either a memory or plasma B-cell. Interruption of this process by a transforming event may result in a clonal proliferation where differentiation of the cell is blocked at this stage. The majority of B-cell lymphomas are derived from GC or post-GC B-cells. As physiologically relevant human models that emulate the various stages of B-cell differentiation are lacking we rationalized that in-vitro utilization of the B-cell lymphotrophic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) would provide insights into this process. In one scenario, EBV infects nai\u0308ve B-cells and drives a differentiation process paralleling the GC reaction through a well-characterized series of latency gene expression programs. EBV is also implicated in a range of GC and post-GC derived B-cell lymphomas (including Burkitt's, Hodgkin's, PTLD and DLBCL). Using high efficiency EBV infection of isolated nai\u0308ve B-cells from EBV seronegative subjects, we have demonstrated that EBV infection provides a highly relevant in-vitro model that accurately reflects three distinct phases in the GC differentiation process. Alterations in the expression of a broad range of genes associated with the differentiation of the nai\u0308ve B-cell were observed within 24 hours of infection and within four days of infection a process exhibiting many similarities to the GC reaction had taken place. These included BCL6, the levels of which were rapidly down-regulated within 24 hours indicating activation of the nai\u0308ve B-cell. Levels of the memory cell marker CD27 steadily increased over 24 to 96 hours, while BLIMP1 expression increased, peaking at 48 hours. An increase in AID expression over 8 to 48 hours was consistent with somatic hypermutation and isotype switching. Finally a dramatic elevation in expression of the GC associated oncogene LMO2 was observed after two days followed by an equally dramatic downregulation after two weeks. Within two weeks of infection (phase 1), B-cells progressed through a GC-like phase followed by a one week transition state (phase 2) after which continued culture resulted in further differentiation to cells with the phenotypic hallmarks of post-GC cells (phase 3). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, which act as negative regulators of gene expression. miRNA expression reflects the developmental lineage and differentiation state of several human cancers and over-expression is implicated in lymphomagenesis. They are also associated with the development of the GC reaction. EBV expresses at least 39 unique miRNAs from the BART and BHRF1 clusters within the viral genome. These EBV miRNAs are differentially expressed in tumour cell lines, suggesting roles during EBV-driven B-cell differentiation and lymphomagenesis. The relationship between EBV miRNAs and the kinetics of EBV driven B-cell differentiation has not been characterized. In our model we find distinct miRNA expression kinetics, coincidental with gene expression changes during B-cell differentiation, suggesting that these regulatory molecules may be involved in the GC process. Although a small number of EBV miRNAs were expressed at low levels early in the GC-like phase 1, the majority were up-regulated during the transition phase 2, exhibiting a subsequent partial down-regulation in the post-GC-like phase 3. The three phases were coincident with differential BART and BHRF1 promoter usage and alternate splicing. Strikingly, application of the infection model to primary patient samples and lymphoma cell-lines revealed that lymphomas clustered within distinct phases, reflecting the full continuum of the B-cell differentiation process. Interestingly, the majority of PTLD samples clustered within the transition phase, whereas Burkitt's and Hodgkin's lymphoma sample segregated with the GC stage. Application of our gene expression and miRNA data to cell-lines and a range of GC and post-GC EBV-positive lymphomas of various histological types indicate that our B-cell differentiation model can be used to accurately classify B-cell lymphomas in a physiologically relevant manner according to the stage of arrested B-cell differentiation.
