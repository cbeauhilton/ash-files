    "abstract_text": "Background BMS-911543 is an oral, selective small-molecule inhibitor of JAK2 (IC 50 =1.1nM) with potent anti-proliferative and pharmacodynamic effects in cell lines and in vivo models dependent upon JAK2 signaling. In vitro , BMS-911543 demonstrates high selectivity within the JAK family (JAK1 [IC 50 =356nM], JAK3 [IC 50 =73nM] or TYK2 [IC 50 =66nM]) and across a large kinase panel (at 1 \u00b5M concentration of BMS-911543, only 8 of 451 kinases were markedly inhibited [\u226567%]) It also has little activity in cells dependent on other JAK family pathways. Anti-proliferative responses were observed with BMS-911543 in colony growth assays using primary progenitor cells isolated from patients with JAK2 V617F-positive polycythemia vera (PV) ( Leukemia 2012;26:280 ). Methods In a multicenter phase 1/2a study, BMS-911543 was administered orally using a BID dosing schedule, in patients with high-, intermediate-2 or intermediate-1 risk symptomatic primary or secondary MF (JAK2 WT or mutant) with platelet counts \u226550,000/mm 3 . Patients were not required to have palpable splenomegaly. The aim of the study is to determine safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of BMS-911543. Safety was assessed using NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Treatment effect was assessed using the International Working Group (IWG) response criteria, MF-SAF, BFI, physical examination, spleen and liver volume assessment by MRI, bone marrow morphology, karyotype, V617F mutant allele burden, plasma cytokine analysis, circulating CD34+ cells and other molecular parameters. Current status To date, 84 patients have been treated (dose escalation [n=42]; dose expansion [n=42]) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as 200mg BID. The summary below represents an interim data analysis of 36 patients from the dose escalation phase dosed at 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160, and 200mg BID. Fifteen of 36 (42%) patients had received prior Jak inhibitors (Jaki) including 3 who had received \u22652 Jak inhibitors. PK, PD, Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy After repeat dosing, greater than dose-proportional increase in the Cmax and AUC, and drug accumulation was observed at doses \u226540mg BID. PD analysis indicated inhibition of JAK/STAT pathway signaling activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and modulation of several soluble peripheral blood proteins including IL-6, EPO and Leptin. Eleven patients (31%) had drug-related AEs. The nine hematological AEs included 3 anemia (1 grade 3 and 2 grade 2); 3 neutropenia (grade 4); and single leukopenia (grade 4), thrombocytopenia (grade 4), and reduction in platelet count (grade 2). Nine non-hematological AEs included 3 nausea (grade1/2); amylase increased (grade 3) and lipase increased (grade 3) one each; and grade 1 fatigue, muscle spasms, insomnia, erectile dysfunction one each. Ten patients (28%) discontinued treatment: 4 were attributed to disease progression, 2 to lack of efficacy, 2 at patient\u2019s request, 1 to poor compliance, and 1 to unrelated AE. Spleen volume reductions (SVR) by MRI were observed in Jaki failure and in Jaki naive patients. Of 11 patients treated at 160 and 200mg, 8 patients (73%) had SVR greater than 35% at 3 months. In contrast, 1 of 4 patients treated at 120mg and none treated below 120mg had SVR greater than 35%. Of the patients treated at 160mg and 200mg, more than 50% had MF-SAF reductions > 50%. Overall, 3 patients (8.3%; 2 treated at 10mg BID and 1 at 200mg BID) had an increase in hemoglobin of \u22652g/dL;. Other signs of clinical activity included reductions in V617F mutant allele burden, leukocytosis, leukoerythroblastosis, circulating CD34+ cells, and LDH. Conclusion BMS-911543 was generally well tolerated and has an acceptable safety and efficacy profile. BMS-911543 induced rapid control of constitutional symptoms, and splenomegaly in patients with symptomatic MF, including those previously treated with one or more Jak inhibitors. Updated data from all 84 patients who have been treated in the dose escalation and ongoing expansion phases, including MRI assessments of spleen and liver volume, V617F mutant allele burden and levels of select plasma cytokines, will be presented.
