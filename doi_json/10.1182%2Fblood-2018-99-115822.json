    "abstract_text": "Background & aim: Although 'interim' positron emission tomography (PET) may inform therapeutic decisions, Risk stratification at diagnosis allow earlier and potentially better modification during the treatment of HL. In this study, we aimed to identify the prognostic role of both the IPET and the CHIPS in predicting the prognosis of HL in our center. Patients and methods: This is a retrospective, single-center study done at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cairo University starting January 2011 to the end of December 2015. A total of 140 patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma were enrolled for analysis of all clinical, pathological and Laboratory Data. Only 83 patients were eligible for analysis of both IPET and CHIPS scoring. PET scan was performed at baseline and after two cycles of chemotherapy. Treatment was not changed according to the results of the interim scan. Childhood Hodgkin International Prognostic Score (CHIPS), was evaluated. Log-rank testing was used to compare EFS for each CHIPS (0-3). Results: Eight three scans out of 140 patients were eligible for analysis of both IPET and CHIPS scoring. Twenty-six patients were scored positive (31.3%) and 57 (68.7%) as negative. The 5- years overall survival (OS) was 94%, 83% for patients with interim positive scans and 97% for patients with interim negative scans (P 0.01). The 5-year Event-free survival (EFS) rate was 86.7% for the whole study population, 76% for patients with interim positive scans and 91% for patients with interim negative scans (P 0.04). The 5 year OS was 100% for patients with CHIPS = 0, 80.4% for patients with CHIPS = 1, 75% for patients with CHIPS = 2, and 100% for patients with CHIPS = 3 (a very limited number of patients), with a p-value of (0.055). Hemoglobin level </= 10) and initial Total Leucocytic count(</= 15,000) were independent prognostic predictors; OS P- value (0.003 and <0.001 ) respectively- and EFS P- value (0.03 and <0.001 ) respectively. Conclusion: The prognostic role and validity of using the interim PET scan response have been confirmed to be strongly related to treatment outcome by the present study; however, the use of CHIPS is a good inexpensive approach to predicting risk in patients with HL that may improve ability to tailor therapy to risk factors known at diagnosis. Other Variables including TLC as well as Hb level will need further larger studies to identify their impact. Figure. View large Download slide Figure.
