    "abstract_text": "The association between stable hematopoietic chimerism and donor specific tolerance (DST) for solid organ grafts was demonstrated clinically and in different experimental models. However, the existing data also demonstrate that the establishment of hematopoietic chimerism does not always correlate with the development of DST, especially for skin grafts. As these issues could have major implications for organ transplantation in general, the present study was undertaken to assess DST in recipients with transient or stable hematopoietic cell (HC) chimerism established after nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens. In a canine model of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) after nonmyeloablative conditioning, DST to skin grafts was evaluated in DLA-identical recipients with stable mixed hematopoietic chimerism (MC) (n=11), or following transient HC engraftment (n=22). There was a significant improvement in the survival of DLA-identical HC donor-derived skin grafts in recipients with stable MC compared to normal recipients (n=7; P <0.0001). However, HC donor-derived skin grafts in 4 recipients with MC developed an inflammatory reaction without skin graft loss consistent with a chronic rejection process. Survival of DLA-identical HC donor-derived skin grafts was also significantly prolonged in recipients after transient HC engraftment compared to normal recipients ( P =0.002). However, a chronic inflammatory process without graft loss developed in all of the HC donor-derived skin grafts from this group. An increased time to rejection of the hematopoietic graft was significantly associated with an improved survival of the subsequent skin graft ( P =0.02). The time to rejection of third-party (DLA-nonidentical) skin grafts (n=40) was the same in recipients with stable MC and previous HC graft as well as normals (median- 8 days). Autologous skin grafts (n=40) survived for the duration of follow-up without developing chronic inflammation. Extended HC donor-specific skin graft survival (>15 days) was predictive of subsequent stable engraftment at second HCT in recipients with previous graft rejection after first HCT. Five of 6 dogs with extended survival of the skin graft beyond day 15 became stable MC after second HCT compared to 0/9 dogs with skin grafts surviving less than 11 days ( P =0.0008). In this model, DST to skin grafts in recipients with stable MC after nonmyeloablative HCT may not be complete, and chronic inflammation may develop without loss of that graft. Partial DST may persist after rejection of HC grafts established with nonmyeloablative conditioning. Further investigations are required to understand the mechanisms responsible for DST after allogeneic HCT.",
