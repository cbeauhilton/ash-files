    "abstract_text": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by multiple low-frequency alterations including somatic mutations, copy number alterations (CNAs) and chromosomal rearrangements. We sought to identify previously unrecognized low-frequency genetic events, integrate recurrent alterations into comprehensive signatures and associate these signatures with clinical parameters. For these reasons, our multi-institutional international group assembled a cohort of 304 primary DLBCLs from newly diagnosed patients, 87% of whom were uniformly treated with state-of-the-art therapy (rituximab-containing CHOP regimen) and had long term followup. Tumors were subjected to whole exome sequencing with an extended bait set that included custom probes designed to capture recurrent chromosomal rearrangements. In this cohort, 47% of samples had available transcriptional profiling and assignment to associated disease subtypes. Analytical pipelines developed at the Broad Institute were used to detect mutations (MuTect), CNAs (Recapseq+Allelic Capseq) and chromosomal rearrangements (dRanger+Breakpointer) and assess clonality (Absolute). To analyze formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumors without paired normals we developed a method which utilized 8334 unrelated normal samples to stringently filter recurrent germline events and artifacts. Significant mutational drivers were identified using the MutSig2CV algorithm and recurrent CNAs were assessed with GISTIC2.0. In addition, we utilized a recently developed algorithm, CLUMPS2, to prioritize somatic mutations which cluster in 3-dimensional protein structure. With this approach, we identified > 90 recurrently mutated genes, 34 focal amplifications and 41 focal deletions, 20 arm-level events and > 200 chromosomal rearrangements in the DLBCL series. Of note, 33% of the mutational drivers were also perturbed by chromosomal rearrangements or CNAs, underscoring the importance of a comprehensive genetic analysis. In the large DLBCL series, we identified several previously unrecognized but potentially targetable alterations including mutations in NOTCH2 (8%) and TET2 (5%). The majority of identified chromosomal rearrangements involved translocations of potent regulatory regions to intact gene coding sequences. The most frequently rearrangements involved Ig regulatory elements which were translocated to BCL2 , MYC, BCL6 and several additional genes with known roles in germinal center B-cell biology. After identifying recurrent somatic mutations, CNAs and chromosomal rearrangements, we performed hierarchical clustering and identified subsets of DLBCLs with comprehensive signatures comprised of specific alterations. A large subset of tumors shared recurrent alterations previously associated with follicular lymphoma including mutations of chromatin modifiers such as CREBBP, MLL2 , and EZH2 in association with alterations of TNFRSF14 and GNA13 and translocations of BCL2 . This cluster was enriched in GCB-type DLBCLs and contained a subset with select genetic alterations associated with an unfavorable outcome. An additional cohort of tumors was characterized by alterations perturbing B-cell differentiation including recurrent BCL6 translocations or alterations of PRDM1 . A subset of these DLBCLs had alterations of NOTCH2 and additional pathway components or mutations of MYD88 in association with TNFAIP3, CD70 and EBF1 , a master regulator of B-cell differentiation. An additional group of DLBCLs exhibited frequent MYD88 mutations in association with alterations of CD79B , PIM1 , TBL1XR1 and ETV6 and BCL2 copy gain; these tumors were highly enriched for ABC-type DLBCLs. This coordinate signature and additional alterations of p53 pathway components were associated with outcome. We explored bases for the identified genetic alterations in DLBCL by performing an in silico mutational signature analysis. The most frequent mutational signatures were those of spontaneous deamination (aging) and AID with rare cases of microsatellite instability. We also assessed the clonality of identified genetic features to define cancer cell fraction and establish the timing of specific genetic events. The comprehensive genetic signatures of clinically annotated DLBCLs provide new insights regarding approaches to targeted therapy.
