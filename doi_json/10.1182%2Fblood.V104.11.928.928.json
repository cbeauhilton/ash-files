    "abstract_text": "Background : High dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) remains the preferred therapy for eligible patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Several studies have demonstrated an improvement in median survival with use of SCT. Patients with myeloma may undergo SCT immediately following 4\u20136 cycles of \u2018induction\u2019 therapy or at the time of relapse from the initial plateau phase. Available evidence does not suggest a survival difference between the two approaches. Methods : We retrospectively evaluated our experience with autologous single SCT for MM to compare the results of delayed SCT to early SCT. We identified from our transplant database, 202 patients with MM, who underwent SCT between October 1992 and November 2002. 101 patients, who responded to induction chemotherapy, had stem cells collected in plateau phase, received maintenance chemotherapy and had SCT at the time of first relapse (delayed SCT group). The remaining 101 patients, after initially achieving a response underwent upfront SCT (early SCT group). Patients refractory to initial therapy were excluded from this study. Most of the early transplants were done in the recent years and hence this group has a shorter follow up. Results : The study cohort had a median age of 55 years (range 29 \u2013 72) at diagnosis consisting of 126 males (62%), with no significant demographic difference between the two groups. As expected measures of tumor burden (M protein, B2M and marrow plasma cell percentage) were significantly higher in the delayed group. Plasma cell labeling indices and presence of abnormal cytogenetics were higher in the delayed SCT group as well at transplant. TBI containing regimens were used more often in the delayed group reflecting a difference in the time periods of transplant. There was no difference between the groups in terms of overall response to transplant though complete response rate was higher for the early transplants. (Table). There was no difference in the time to overall response between the groups (P=0.13, Kaplan Meier estimate). Though the median progression free survival (PFS) from transplant was shorter for the delyaed SCT group, the overall survival (OS) from diagnosis of MM was comparable for the two groups (Table). The overall survival estimate at 5 year from diagnosis was 60% for both groups. Conclusions : Review of our experience demonstrates comparable overall survival for an early SCT compared to SCT at the time of relapse. Although there is an advantage for early SCT in terms of more chemosensitive disease as shown by a longer PFS from SCT, there is no benefit in OS from time of diagnosis. Patient preference and other co-morbidities should play a role in the decision regarding timing of transplant. This study has the disadvantage of being retrospective in nature and the two groups being spread over different periods in time.  . Early (n=101) . Delayed (n=101) . P .
