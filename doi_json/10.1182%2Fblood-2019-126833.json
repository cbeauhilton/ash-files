    "abstract_text": "Understanding the cell-autonomous as well as niche contributions governing erythropoiesis is critical for directed differentiation approaches of hematopoietic stem cells into differentiated red blood cells (RBCs) to treat blood disorders such as anemias and leukemias. Transcriptional intermediary factor 1 gamma (TIF1\u03b3) is essential for erythropoiesis from zebrafish to mammals. Zebrafish moonshine mutant embryos defective for tif1\u03b3 do not make red blood cells (RBCs) due to a transcription elongation block characterized by aberrantly paused RNA polymerase II. Loss of factors involved in transcription elongation control, PAF1 and spt5 , rescues the moonshine RBC defect. To elucidate the TIF1\u03b3-mediated mechanisms in erythroid differentiation, we have performed a high-content chemical suppressor screen in the bloodless moonshine mutant using 3,500 compounds. Among the suppressors, we identified leflunomide, an inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an essential enzyme for de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Leflunomide as well as the structurally unrelated DHODH inhibitor brequinar both rescue the formation of primitive erythroid cells in 61% (38/62) and 68% (50/74) of moonshine embryos, respectively. Blastula transplant experiments revealed that tif1\u03b3 , in addition to its cell-autonomous role, plays a role in the hematopoietic niche for RBC development. Through in-vivo metabolomics analyses we have identified nucleotide metabolism as the most significantly altered process in moonshine mutants, including elevated levels of uridine monophosphate and low levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ). Low NAD + levels are accompanied by a reduced oxygen consumption rate in tif1\u03b3 -depleted embryos by Seahorse analysis. In support, genome-wide transcriptome analysis coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed genes encoding coenzyme Q (CoQ) metabolic enzymes as direct TIF1\u03b3 targets. DHODH is the only enzyme of the pyrimidine de novo synthesis pathway located on the inner mitochondrial membrane and its activity is coupled to that of the electron transport chain (ETC). Rotenone, a potent ETC complex I inhibitor reverses the rescue of the blood defect by DHODH inhibition in moonshine embryos. Since DHODH function is linked to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation via CoQ activity, we asked whether alterations in mitochondrial metabolism might be causal for the RBC defect in moonshine mutants. Indeed, treatment with the CoQ analog decylubiquinone results in rescue of \u03b2e3 globin expression in 26% (33/126) of moonshine embryos. These results demonstrate a tight coordination of nucleotide and mitochondrial metabolism as a key function of tif1\u03b3 -dependent transcription and reveal that TIF1\u03b3 activity regulates a metabolic program that drives cell fate decisions in the early blood lineage. Our work highlights the importance of the plasticity achieved by transcription regulatory processes such as transcription elongation for metabolic processes during lineage differentiation and could have therapeutic potential for blood diseases and consequences for erythroid differentiation protocols.
