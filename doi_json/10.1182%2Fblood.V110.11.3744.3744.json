    "abstract_text": "Gammaretroviral vectors used in recent gene therapy clinical trials have lead to several successes, such as in the treatment of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency disease, but have also resulted in insertional activation of nearby oncogenes, leading to leukemia in four patients. We previously reported the successful treatment of four dogs with canine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (CLAD), a lethal genetic immunodeficiency disease caused by defects in the leukocyte integrin CD18, by transplanting foamy viral (FV) vector (deltaphiMscv-cCD18) - transduced, autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. To date, more than 2 years post transplant, all four dogs have maintained CD18+ leukocyte levels ranging between 5\u201310%, completely reversing of the CLAD phenotype, and have no clinical or laboratory evidence of hematological malignancy. To assess the potential genotoxicity of the FV gene therapy in the treatment of CLAD, we compared the insertion sites (ISs) found in the FV vector treated CLAD dogs with ISs found in CLAD dogs treated by gammaretroviral (RV) vectors (PG13/Mscv-cCD18). Insertion sites were identified by DNA sequence analysis of ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) or linear amplification-mediated PCR (LAM-PCR) amplicons and subsequent comparison to the dog genome (canFam 2.0, May 2005). Insertion site analysis was performed for integrations that were in or within 50 kb of Refseq genes (using mouse/human orthologs). Analysis of the ISs revealed a reduced preference for FV vector integrations near transcription start sites compared to RV vector integrations (41% vs. 48%), fewer integrations near potential oncogenes (11% vs. 16%), and fewer integrations within genes in general (41% vs. 52%), in the FV vector treated animals compared to the RV vector treated animals. These clinically relevant data suggest that a reduced insertional mutagenesis potential exists when using FV vectors compared to RV vectors, and support the use of FV vectors in the treatment of human hematopoietic stem cell diseases such as LAD."
