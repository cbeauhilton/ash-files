    "abstract_text": "Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease is increasingly recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in post-stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients due to a lack of cellular immunity. Thus, novel therapies that offer the restoration of cellular immunity in SCT patients are highly desirable for clinical use. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against CMV represent a major effector arm of the immune system to control viremia. However, it is well established that the efficient induction and persistence of CTL responses in vivo requires the concomitant induction of antigen-specific CD4 + T helper cells. In this study, we sought to determine whether human dendritic cells (DC) transfected with mRNA encoding an invariant chain-CMVpp65 fusion protein (Ii-pp65) were capable of inducing concomitant CMV-specific CTL and CD4 + responses, thereby constituting a useful strategy for immunotherapy of CMV disease. We show that transfection of DC with Ii-pp65 mRNA leads to enhanced stimulation of CMV-specific CTL in vitro (Figure 1). Furthermore, DC expressing Ii-pp65 are potent inducers of primary CMV-specific CD4 + T cell responses as evidenced by ELISPOT analyses of primed CD4 + CD45RA + T cells (Figure 2). Lastly, efficient routing of Ii-pp65 into the MHC class II presentation pathway is demonstrated by confocal microscopy (data not shown). Based on these preclinical findings, we propose a clinical trial to administer DC, transfected with mRNA encoding a chimeric Ii-pp65, to post-SCT patients. Our primary goal will be to prevent CMV infection and reactivation by inducing strong immune reactivities against CMV.
