    "abstract_text": "Abstract 816 We hypothesized that imatinib plus sequential chemotherapy would result in significant leukemia cell cytoreduction (molecular remission) in patients with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), allowing collection of normal hematopoietic stem cells uncontaminated by residual BCR/ABL+ lymphoblasts and thus reduce the likelihood of relapse after autologous (auto) stem cell transplant (SCT) for patients 120 days had CMR; 2 additional patients achieved MMR, and 1 patient had residual MRD >0.001 (less than MMR); however, the sample size was too small to analyze the effect of MRD on outcome. After a median follow up time of 5.1 years, 9 (47%) of 19 auto-SCT patients and 7 of 15 (47%) of the allo-SCT patients remain alive in continuous CR. Ten of the transplanted patients have relapsed (8 following auto-SCT and 2 following allo-SCT); relapses occurred at a median of 5.9 months following auto-SCT. The DFS (median, 5.5 vs 4.1 years; P=0.84) and OS (median, 6.0 years vs. not reached at >6 years; P=0.90) were similar between those who underwent auto- or allo-SCT (Panels C and D). We conclude that patients who have MRD at levels lower than or equal to MMR following auto-SCT have prolonged survival and that auto-SCT represents a safe and effective alternative to allo-SCT for Ph+ ALL patients without sibling donors. The intergroup trial CALGB 10701 (Alliance) is now testing this strategy in Ph+ ALL patients >50 year old, using dasatinib as the BCR/ABL inhibitor.
