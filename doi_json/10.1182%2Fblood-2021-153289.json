    "abstract_text": "Certain autoantibodies that bind to tissue antigens or that deposit in tissues as a component of immune complexes can activate the classical complement cascade, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. As the initiating molecule of the classical complement cascade, C1q is an attractive target for preventing complement activation and its multiple tissue-damaging effects. ANX009 is an antigen binding fragment (Fab) of a humanized antibody against C1q that inhibits C1q substrate interactions and fully blocks activation of all downstream classical complement components. While inhibiting the classical cascade, ANX009 leaves the lectin and alternative complement pathways intact for their normal immune functions. ANX009 is formulated for subcutaneous (SC) administration and is designed for treatment of blood-based and vascular antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and lupus nephritis, where complement activation is a key component of disease pathology. A phase 1 first-in-human single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study of ANX009 with subcutaneous administration was conducted in 48 healthy volunteers (NCT04535752). Four SAD cohorts were enrolled followed by two MAD cohorts evaluating daily dosing for 7 days or twice weekly dosing x 4 doses. Each cohort had eight participants randomized in a 6:2 active:placebo ratio. Safety and tolerability were assessed, along with serum pharmacokinetics (unbound drug), pharmacodynamics (unbound C1q target), and an ex vivo measure of C1q activity (CH 50 hemolysis of antibody-sensitized sheep red blood cells). All dose levels were well-tolerated. No drug-related safety signals, dose-limiting toxicities, serious adverse events, or adverse events leading to discontinuations were observed. Mild, transient, local injection site reactions were observed. A clear dose-response relationship was observed in SAD cohorts. Negligible reduction in free C1q was observed in the two lowest dose cohorts. A maximum mean reduction in free C1q of 80% was observed at 48 hours post-dose at the third dose level, and full reduction of free C1q through 72 hours was observed at the highest dose level. Similarly, full reduction of free C1q was observed in the MAD cohort with daily dosing as well as in the second MAD cohort with twice weekly dosing. Full reduction of C1q was maintained for 4 days following the last dose in the second MAD cohort. Ex vivo functional activity of C1q was completely inhibited in close correspondence with free C1q levels. Combined safety, tolerability, and clinical pharmacology results from this phase 1 study support advancement of ANX009 to studies in patients with complement-mediated autoimmune disorders.
