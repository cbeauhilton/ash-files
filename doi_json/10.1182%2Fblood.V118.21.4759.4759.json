    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4759 We evaluated a novel e-notebook -based education program for patients with multiple myeloma. The program was developed by the Myeloma Initiative in the Veteran's Administration (MIVA) consortium to educate patients about myeloma while they wait for clinic appointments or procedures. The goals of this study were to assess the feasibility of the program in a busy clinic setting, patients \u2018knowledge after the program and patients\u2019 acceptance of the e-notebook format. Study subjects were patients with multiple myeloma being treated at the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System McClellan Hospital. Eligibility criteria were diagnosis of multiple myeloma and ability to follow instructions in the program and complete a paper questionnaire. Study subjects evaluated the module while awaiting their clinic visit and then completed a survey consisting of ten multiple-choice questions designed to measure the goals of the study. The scope of the questions were: patients' primary source of medical education, patients' perceived benefit of the education program in improving their understanding of their disease (three questions), patients' preferences in regard to educational formats (three questions), and multiple myeloma knowledge (three questions). Fifteen consecutive patients were enrolled in the study. Patient flow was not adversely affected by use of the module in the waiting room and the program was well accepted by the patients. Most patients in our study (93%) considered their primary source of medical information about their disease to be their oncologist, followed by internet resources (20%). Most patients (93%) stated that the education program helped them better understand the information provided by their oncologists and better understand multiple myeloma treatment options. Twelve patients (60%) answered that the program motivated them to learn more about myeloma. Fourteen patients (93%) recommended that this program be expanded to spouses or family members, and twelve patients (80%) advocated creating a video format of the program for repeat viewing. Nine patients (60%) stated they plan to view the content again at a later time. Of all multiple myeloma knowledge questions, 76% were answered correctly and 60% of the patients who answered correctly attributed their answers to information they learned in the education program. We conclude that this e-notebook -based multiple myeloma education program is well accepted and can be adopted in a busy clinic. It is an effective and motivating tool for patient education in adjunct with physician efforts. It can be a productive utilization of waiting room time and has the potential for further applications.
