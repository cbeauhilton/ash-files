    "abstract_text": "Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) is described as an indolent lymphoma with a long term survival. However classical prognostic factors can not distinguish between patients who are likely to have good or poor outcomes. Moreover histological progression occurs in 10\u201320% of cases at the time of recurrence, but may be present at diagnosis, inducing a shorter survival with a median around 2 years. New model based on molecular understanding are needed to better discriminate these patients for their prognosis and disease evolution. Biopsy samples of splenic MZL from 43 patients treated in one institution and 8 with transformed splenic MZL were examined for gene expression using a nylon cDNA microarray consisting of 7, 000 human genes. Two of them came from a group of matched pair of splenic MZL and the transformed counterpart. An additional group comprising 4 transformed follicular lymphomas and 1 transformed small lymphocytic lymphoma were also analysed. Hierarchical clustering realized with all samples allowed to visualized patterns of gene expression already described in our previous work1 and corresponding to precise functions (proliferation, early response...), cell or tissue subtype (T cells, stroma \u2026) or lymphoma subtype (MZL, MCL, SLL). The ability of individual genes to distinguish 1/ MZL and transformed-MZL subtypes, and 2/ alive patients and dead patients was calculated using a supervised method (discriminating score and bootstrap resampling). This allowed us to construct molecular predictors of survival and histological transformation. Transformation discriminating genes regrouped 73 genes related to cell proliferation such as CDC10, CDK4, PRKDC, PLCG2, LDHA, MCL2, and NPM1. P53 was down-expressed in all the transformed samples. Survival discriminating genes regrouped 26 genes from a unique cluster related to cell proliferation such as LDHA, NME1, MYC, ENO1. Although these genes seem to participate to the same function, only one gene was found discriminating the 2 parameters (LDHA). Gene ontology analysis using GOminer showed that the histological transformation was more related to cyclin-dependent protein kinase and that the survival was more related to metabolism. We used 26 genes to construct a predictor for survival in MZL patients. This gene-based predictor allowed predicting survival (p <0.00001) in MZL patients better than with classical prognostic factors (age, performance status, stage, LDH, monoclonal component, IPI\u2026), but also in transformed MZL patients. In conclusion, genes involved in histological transformation and survival in MZL patients are implicated in independent but complementary functions leading to cell proliferation.",
