    "abstract_text": "Apoptosis-related proteins are important molecules for predicting chemotherapy response and prognosis in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, data on the expression and prognostic impact of these molecules in childhood AML are rare. Using flow cytometry and western blot analysis, we therefore investigated 45 leukemic cell samples of children with de novo AML enrolled and treated within the German AML-BFM93 study for the expression of apoptosis-regulating proteins (CD95, Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-xL, Procaspase-3, XIAP, cIAP-1, Survivin). XIAP (p<0.002) but no other apoptosis regulators showed maturation-dependent expression differences as determined by FAB morphology with the highest expression levels observed within the immature M0/1 subtypes. XIAP (p<0.01) and Bcl-xL (p<0.01) expression was lower in patients with favorable than intermediate/poor cytogenetics. After a mean follow-up of 34 months, a shorter overall survival was associated with high expression levels of XIAP {30 (n=10) vs. 41 months (n=34); p<0.05} and Survivin {27 (n=10) vs. 41 months (n=34); p<0.05}. We conclude that apoptosis-related molecules are associated with maturation stage, cytogenetic risk groups and therapy outcome in childhood de novo AML. The observed association of XIAP with immature FAB types, intermediate/poor cytogenetics and poor overall survival should be confirmed within prospective pediatric AML trials."
