    "abstract_text": "Introduction Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an example of an autoimmune disease in which B-lymphocytes produce autoantibodies against platelets. Antibody-mediated platelet destruction and suboptimal platelet production leads to a decrease in platelet count. ITP patients with thrombocytopaenia have increased plasma levels of a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), a factor that can promote B-cell maturation and survival. Two new compounds that bind to the thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) and activate the megakaryopoiesis have been recently approved for the treatment of chronic ITP as second-line treatment. Objective It has been recently reported an improved regulatory T-cell activity in patients with chronic ITP treated with TPO-R agonists (TPO-RA) (Bao et al, 2010). So we aimed to evaluate the effect of TPO-RA treatment on APRIL plasma levels in ITP patients before (ITP-1) and after responding (ITP-2) to the treatment. Methods This was an observational and prospective study. Thirteen patients with chronic ITP in whom treatment with a TPO-RA was indicated, and thirty-three healthy controls were included. ITP patients were studied at two times: at inclusion (ITP-1), when platelet count was less than 30x10 9 /L for patients without concomitant medication or less than 65x10 9 /L for patients receiving corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin; and after a response to TPO-RA therapy was elicited (ITP-2). The response to TPO-RA was defined as a platelet count >30x10 9 /L in patients without additional treatment or >65x10 9 /L for those with concomitant treatments. EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood was centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15 min at 23\u00b0C to obtain platelet poor plasma which was then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min at room temperature. Supernatant plasma was stored at \u201370\u00b0C until analysis. Plasma TPO and APRIL concentrations were determined using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Duoset-R&D, Minneapolis, Mn, USA). Platelet counts were determined with a Coulter Ac. T Diff cell counter (Beckman Coulter, Madrid, Spain). Comparisons of quantitative variables were made with ANOVA and Dunn test. Results were expressed as mean\u00b1SD. Correlations were calculated with Spearman test. Values of p\u22640.05 were considered statistically significant. Results Platelet count in the ITP-1 group ((23\u00b117)x10 9 /L) increased after responding to TPO-RA to values similar to controls (controls: (233\u00b177)x10 9 /L and ITP-2: (140\u00b136)x10 9 /L). TPO plasma level was higher in ITP-1 patients (30.05\u00b126.81 pg/ml, p<0.005) than in healthy controls (7.36\u00b111.74 pg/ml) but not significantly different when compared with the values of the ITP-2 group (26.81\u00b117.62 pg/ml). ITP-1 patients showed significantly higher APRIL plasma levels (37.60+28.73 ng/ml, p<0.0001) than controls (2.20\u00b13.11 ng/ml) and ITP-2 patients (4.92+4.68 ng/ml), indicating that TPO-RA treatment caused a diminution in APRIL plasma levels. When looking into the relationship between APRIL plasma levels and platelet count, a significant correlation was only found in the ITP-1 group (r=-0.5919, p<0.05). This supports the potential role of APRIL in the reduction of platelet counts in ITP patients. Conclusion ITP patients with thrombocytopaenia that responded to TPO-RA treatment increased their platelet count reducing plasma APRIL levels and without changing the moderately high levels of plasma TPO. Reductions in APRIL levels caused by TPO-RA treatment could be an additional mechanism that contributes to an increased platelet count in ITP patients treated with these agents.
