    "abstract_text": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of direct factor Xa inhibitor, YM150 and its major in vivo metabolite, YM-222714, on clot formation and clot lysis compared with other anticoagulants, such as a direct thrombin inhibitor (melagatran), a pentasaccharide (fondaparinux), low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) and unfractionated heparin. To assess clot lysis, the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-induced clot lysis assay was used with human plasma triggered by low and high levels of tissue factor (TF). Under low TF conditions, clot formation was completely prevented by melagatran at 1 \u03bcmol/L, by fondaparinux at all concentrations examined (0.1 to 1 \u03bcg/mL), by enoxaparin at 0.3 and 1 IU/mL and by heparin at 0.1 and 0.3 U/mL. Even under high TF conditions, 0.3 U/mL heparin prevented any clot formation. Although melagatran, fondaparinux, enoxaparin, and heparin potently prevented plasma clot formation under low TF conditions, under high TF conditions they were less effective at prolonging the clotting time. Under both low and high TF conditions, YM150 and YM-222714 prolonged the clotting time in a concentration dependent manner at concentrations between 0.3 and 3 \u03bcmol/L. YM150 and YM-222714 significantly accelerated clot lysis under both low and high TF conditions, but their effects were most evident under high TF conditions. Lower concentrations of melagatran (0.1 and 0.3 \u03bcmol/L) enhanced clot lysis under low TF conditions, but under high TF conditions, enhancement of clot lysis required higher melagatran concentrations (0.3 \u03bcmol/L or more). Under high TF conditions, fondaparinux enhanced clot lysis only at the highest concentration tested (1 \u03bcg/mL). Enoxaparin and heparin enhanced clot lysis under low TF conditions at the lowest test concentrations (0.1 IU/mL and 0.03 U/mL, respectively). Both also enhanced clot lysis under high TF conditions, but their effect reached statistical significance only at higher concentrations (1 IU/mL and 0.1 U/mL, respectively). These results suggested that direct factor Xa inhibitors, YM150 and YM-222714, exert stable anticoagulant effects independently of TF concentration. Both inhibitors enhanced tPA-induced fibrinolysis in human plasma clotted via the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Useful characteristics of YM150 and YM-222714, such as a linear dose response and reliable anticoagulation independent of TF concentration, may lead to the creation of an anticoagulant that is easier to use in the clinical setting than existing products. Potentially beneficial antithrombotic effects, which can be promoted by accelerating endogenous fibrinolytic pathways, may further aid in the prevention or treatment of thrombosis."
