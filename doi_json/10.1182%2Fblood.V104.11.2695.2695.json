    "abstract_text": "(Purpose) We tested the capacity of mouse bone marrow (BM) and human cord blood (CB) cells to give rise to cardiomyocytes in vivo. In the generation of murine BM-derived cardiomyocytes, structural- and functional differences between donor BM- and host-derived myocytes were examined. In the xenogeneic transplantation system, we examined the contribution of cell fusion as mechanism underlying generation of CB-derived cardiomyocytes. (Methods) For syngeneic transplantation, 5x105 lineage-antigen negative (Lin-) BM cells of mice with ubiquitous expression of green fluorescence protein (GFP) were intravenously injected into irradiated neonatal C57BL/6 recipients. For xenogeneic transplantation, 2 x 106 Lin- CB cells were transplanted into NOD/SCID/b2-microglobulinnull (NOD/SCID/b2mnull) mice. Morphological analysis was performed by immunostaining for myocyte-specific antigens (connexin 43, troponin I, and dystrophin). Transmission electron microscopic analysis with immunostaining for GFP was performed to examine the structural difference between GFP+ and GFP\u2212 myocytes. In xenogeneic transplantation, double FISH analysis using species-specific probes was performed to identify the origin of each myocyte. (Results) During the maturation of recipient mice, donor-derived GFP+ striated cells were generated and displayed characteristic phenotypic features of cardiomyocytes. Nuclear staining revealed the presence of GFP+ mononucleate- and binucleate cardiomyocytes. The transmission electron microscopic analyses on GFP+ myocytes revealed the presence of abundant mitochondria, which would be needed for continuous contraction. More importantly, the presence of gap junction between GFP+ and GFP\u2212 myocytes indicated that BM-derived cardiomyocytes formed functional network with host-derived cardiomyocytes. Mechanical injury on neonatal cardiac apex accelerated the migration of BM-derived cells and generation of GFP+ cardiomyocytes. The kinetic analysis of freshly isolated myocardium revealed that GFP+ myocytes contracted efficiently at the single cell level. In recipient cardiac tissues, GFP+ myocytes, vimentin+ fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells persisted until 15 months post-transplantation. Finally, human CB Lin- cells generated connexin 43+ cardiomyocytes, following transplantion into immune-deficient neonatal mice. Double FISH analysis using species-specific probes demonstrated that the majority of human chromosome-containing cardiomyocytes in recipient cardiac tissue possessed murine chromosome in their nuclei, while human chromosome+ murine chromosome- cardiomyocytes were also present. (Conclusion) Murine BM and human CB cells can give rise to cardiomyocytes, which show similar morphological and structural characteristics to those of host-derived cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, hematopoietic tissue-derived cells can contribute to the generation of cardiomyocytes mainly by fusion-dependent and partly by fusion-independent mechanism even across a xenogeneic histocompatibility barrier.",
