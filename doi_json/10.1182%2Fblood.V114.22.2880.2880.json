    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2880 Poster Board II-856 Background: MM is increasing in incidence and remains incurable. .NK cells have modest killing activity against MM tumor cells in part because of inhibitory KIR receptors which recognize HLA class 1 antigens on MM tumor cell targets. However, experimental and clinical data in the allogeneic transplant setting suggest that NK cell stimulation by a mismatch between donor KIR and patient KIR ligand may improve outcomes for MM after a reduction of tumor burden by previously administered treatments. To mimic this effect with a pharmaceutical agent, 1-7F9/IPH2101, a fully human IgG4 anti-KIR mAb specific for KIR2DL1/2/3 (HLA-C specific KIRs) was generated (Romagne et al ., Blood June, 2009). 1-7F9/IPH 2101 enhances patient NK cell cytotoxicity against autologous MM tumor cells in vitro . We present the interim results of the human phase I trial of this agent in patients with relapsed/refractory MM. Methods: An open-label, single-agent, dose-escalation, multiple dose safety and tolerability study of IPH2101 is being conducted in heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed/refractory MM. Dose escalation with IPH2101 (0.0003, 0.003, 0.015, 0.075, 0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg as IV infusion) is being studied using a 3+3 scheme. Re-dosing criteria (1/month x 4 months) are based on safety data from previous dosing. KIR occupancy, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, effects on NK cell maturation, and biological effects of IPH 2101 are being monitored in all patients. Results: Currently, dose escalation is entering the final (3 mg/kg) cohort. Data from the first 22 treated patients are available. No Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) has been observed. 1 pt (at DL1) has been replaced and 3 additional pts have been enrolled (at DL4) due to an SAE an acute renal failure possibly related to drug. Related Adverse Events were seen in 4/22 patients (18%). 12/22 pts received at least 2 doses (6pts had 2, 1 pt had 3 and 5 pts had 4 cycles-median 2). KIR full occupancy (> 90%) for at least 3 weeks is reached at 1mg /kg. In accordance with the pre-clinical PK/PD model there is a clear relationship between exposure (Cmax) and KIR occupancy. No deleterious effect on NK cell maturation has been seen. IPH 2101 has been well tolerated to date. In the cohorts accrued to date, two heavily pre-treated patients, both with high-risk cytogenetics, showed evidence to suggest disease stabilization while receiving IPH-2101. Conclusions: IPH 2101 improves autologous NK cell killing of MM tumor cells by blocking inhibitory KIR. In the on-going clinical trial, the antibody appears safe and well tolerated at the doses tested. Updated study results will be presented at the time of the meeting This immunotherapeutic approach may hold promise as treatment for MM and further study is warranted.
