    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2936 Almost all patients (pts) with multiple myeloma eventually relapse and remission duration decreases with each regimen. The median Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in pts with relapsed myeloma refractory to lenalidomide (len) and bortezomib (btz) is poor at 5 and 9 months respectively. A phase 1 study of len plus btz in pts with relapsed or relapsed, refractory MM (RRMM) demonstrated favorable toxicity and promising response and survival further confirmed in a phase 2 study with len, btz and dexamethasone (dex) [RVD]. In this retrospective study, we assessed the efficacy and toxicity profile of RVD therapy for pts with advanced RRMM. We retrospectively reviewed the records of all pts with RRMM treated with RVD at Princess Margaret Hospital between 03/09 and 05/11. Relapse was defined according to the Uniform International Criteria. Pts were given RVD therapy as previous described by Anderson et al and must have completed at least one cycle of RVD therapy. Primary endpoints were response rate (RR), PFS, OS, and toxicity. Pts discontinued therapy if they experienced PD, no additional benefit or unacceptable toxicity. Definitions of response and progression were used according to the EBMT modified criteria with a category of very good partial response (VGPR). To examine variables independently prognostic for PFS and OS, multivariate Cox analysis was performed. Differences in continuous variables between groups were compared using Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Survival curves were constructed according to the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log rank test. Thirty pts with RRMM received RVD therapy. Clinical characteristics are seen in Table 1 . Median age at RVD initiation was 57 yrs (37\u201376 yrs), and 46.7% were male. Pts received a median of 3 prior therapies (1\u20136). In many instances, pts previously treated with len had len added to btz + dex at progression (n=6), or pts previously treated with btz had btz added to len + dex, at progression (n=5). Thalidomide (thal), len and btz containing regimens were previously used in 60%, 73.3% and 80% of pts respectively. PR or better was observed in 46.6%. After a median of 4.6 cycles (1\u201314), VGPR was seen in 4.8%, PR in 33% and SD in 14%. Pts who achieved PR or better experienced a significant improvement in PFS. There was no difference in terms of RR between those pts according to prior exposure to either btz or len (p=0.7 and 0.9 respectively). Eight pts experienced non-hematological grade 3/4 adverse events (26%), including muscle weakness, sepsis and pneumonia but there was no worsening of peripheral neuropathy. Grade 3\u20134 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia were commonly seen in 70% of pts (n=21). Disease progression was seen in 19 pts at a median of 3.9 months. Median PFS for pts previously exposed to len was 2.3 months vs 2.9 months for those with no prior exposure (p=0.75). On the other hand, median PFS for pts previously exposed to btz was 2.1 months vs 3.4 months for those with no prior exposure (p=0.9) In addition, median PFS for pts who achieved at least PR was significantly better at 5.9 vs 2.0 months for those who did not (p<0.005). ( Figure 1  ) FISH cytogenetics studies were available in 19 out of 30 patients at relapse: 5 -normal, 4\u201313q deletion, 3-p53 deletion and 2 - t(4, 14). High-risk MM pts had a median PFS significantly lower of 0.6 months (CI 95%, 0\u20131.99) vs 4.7 months for those without high-risk features (CI 2.5\u20137.0) (p=0.008) ( Figure 2  ) At the time of submission, 13 pts are alive (43.3%) and 7 pts (23%) continue on RVD therapy.

We question whether response is dependent on recognized risk factors such as adverse cytogenetics. Disclosures: Jimenez-Zepeda: J & J: Honoraria.
