    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5132 Introduction To define the abnormalities in surface GPs expression on circulating platelets and provide better biomarker of bleeding and thrombotic disorders, we develop a high-throughput assay using biotin-avidin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BA-ELISA) to test platelet responses to key platelet agonists and antagonists. Methods SZ51(anti-P-selectin mAb) coated-plate was added into 100\u03bc l PRP with 10\u03bc l ADP (27\u03bc mol/L ADP)or 10\u03bc l PBS without ADP and incubated for 1 h. Activated platelets captured were reacted with biotin-SZ-2 for 1 h. Then, the plate was re-incubated with avidin-HRP coiugated for 1h. Binding avidin was detected with OPD. The levels of P-selectin were detected in AMI group, ICH group, DM group or control group using the BA-ELISA method. This BA-ELISA was compared with flow cytometer (FCM). Inhibition of platelet GPs function was evaluated with inhibitory mAb, SZ21 and aspirin respectively. Results The BA-ELISA can detect platelet count as low as 6.25 \u00d7 10 9 /L in PRP. Both of the inter-assay and intra-assay coefficient variation (C V) were less than 10%. The OD492nm values of the ADP-induced P-selectin in 30 AMI, 30 ICH and 30 DM platelets in PRP were 1.76\u00b1 0.56, 1.95\u00b10.53 and 1.51\u00b10.14 which was significantly higher than that in controls (0.68\u00b10.21, P<0.01). The OD 492nm values of non ADP-induced P-selectin in 30 AMI, 30 ICH or 30 DM platelets in PRP were 0.72\u00b10.25, 1.53\u00b10.61 and 0.61\u00b10.16 significantly higher than that in 30 controls (0.18\u00b10.09, P<0.01). The correlation between the BA-ELISA and FCM was concordant (R=0.86). SZ21 or aspirin could inhibit the expression of P-selectin induced by ADP. Conclusion BA-ELISA is suitable for measuring platelet GP function and is also useful for diagnostic tests and for screening of inhibitors/activators of platelet activation.
