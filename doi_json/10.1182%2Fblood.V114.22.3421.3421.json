Patients and Methods We have explored the efficacy and safety of SB in 95 patients with MM. The regimen comprised BCNU at 300mg/m2 on day 1, etoposide 200mg/m2 on days 1-4; cytarabine 400mg/m2 on days 1-5; melphalan 140mg/m2 on day 5 plus: bortezomib 1.0-1.3mg/m2 on days 1+4, thalidomide 100-200mg on days 1-5, dexamethasone 20-40mg days 1-5, cisplatin 10-12.5mg/m2/d by continuous infusion on days 1-5, rapamycin 3mg on day 1 and 1mg on days 2-5; followed by autotransplant (AT) on day 6. Results Patient characteristics included age >=65, 19%; LDH>ULN, 43%; CA, 67%; GEP high-risk, 44%; GEP MF, 15%; GEP delTP53, 22%; prior AT, 75% including 46% with 2AT and 12% with 3 AT. CR and near-CR status was documented in 50%; TRM occurred within 100 days in 6%. Three-year estimates of overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 34% and 18%; OS/EFS were superior: (a) without CA \u2013 60%/50% versus 15%/5% with CA (p=0.003/0.0005); (b) with GEP low-risk \u2013 55%/20% versus 10%/15% with high-risk MM (p=0.009/0.01); (c) with GEP Hyperdiploidy and Low Bone disease molecular subgroups \u2013 70%/35% versus 20%/10% in the remainder (p=0,001/0.002); and (d) absence of progression prior to SB \u2013 52%/35% versus 16%/5% for the remainder (p=0.002/0.0006). Univariately significant adverse variables for OS and EFS included low albumin, B2M>=3.5mg/L, CA, GEP high-risk and relapse just prior to SB, of which B2M, CA and pre-SB survived on multivariate analysis for the 78 patients with all variables; among the 57 with GEP data, OS was inferior with GEP high-risk MM (HR=3.55, p=0.007) whereas EFS was inferior with high LDH (HR=3.44, p=0.004), CA (HR=2.79, p=0.02) and pre-SB relapse (HR=2.94, p=0.035). Conclusions We conclude that SB is a safe salvage regimen that was well-tolerated for the majority in the outpatient setting. Although beneficial to patients lacking CA and GEP high-risk status, the poor outcome also with SB in the presence of these adverse features emphasize the urgent need to discover agents/strategies effective in this setting.
