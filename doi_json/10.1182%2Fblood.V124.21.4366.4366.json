    "abstract_text": "The growth of various solid tumors, lymphoma and leukemias is not only the result of cell-specific changes at the genetic and epigenetic level, but is also affected by the surrounding stroma and the cells therein. It has been shown that tumor cells induce surrounding immune cells to express various cytokines and other factors, which promote further growth and spread of tumor cells. Most studies have been conducted with solid tumors, however, not much is known about the role of stroma cells with regard to haematopoietic tumors. In addition, our knowledge is limited with regard to the cell intrinsic factors governing the polarization of stroma cells. We intended to study the role of stroma cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a malignant disease of the myeloid lineage and in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a disease which is characterized by disturbed function of the bone marrow, which can often progress to AML. We focused our studies on two different components of the stroma: mesenchymal stroma cells (MSC) and monocytes. Bone marrow derived MSCs and monocytes originating from AML patients better supported the growth of human leukemia cells in vitro than MSCs and monocytes from control healthy persons. Interestingly, after achieving a remission, MSCs and monocytes from the cured patients did not any more support the growth of leukemia cells to the same extent as monocytes and MSCs from leukemic patients. To better understand the mechanism behind this observation, we used different murine MDS and AML models. Similar to the finding in human patients, bone marrow derived MSCs and monocytes from MDS and AML mice better supported the growth of leukemic cells in vitro than monocytes and MDSc from healthy mice. In addition, we observed a higher number of non-malignant MSCs and monocytes in the bone marrow of leukemic mice than in the bone marrow of healthy mice. Furthermore, the higher the number of monocytes was in the bone marrow of the mice, the more aggressive was the course of the leukemia. On a molecular level we found that the transcription factor Gfi1 is 3-4 fold upregulated in the MSCs and monocytes of leukemic mice. To verify whether Gfi1 is indeed required for the polarization of MSCs and monocytes we used leukemic Gfi1-deficient mice. In these mice the accumulation of monocytes was less pronounced than in the bone marrow of Gfi1 wildtype mice. In addition MSCs and monocytes from Gfi1-deficient mice did not support to the same extent the growth of leukemic cell lines in vitro , as did the monocytes and MSCs of Gfi1 wildtype leukemic mice. Thus, we have first indications that MSCs and monocytes play an important role in the support of leukemic cells and that Gfi1 is involved in the polarization of these cells and thus Gfi1 could serve as an additional approach to treat leukemia and MDS.
