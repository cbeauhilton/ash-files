    "abstract_text": "Abstract 674 Background: Paradigm changes in cancer therapy have shifted care to primarily outpatient-based regimens. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a well-known complication of cancer but contemporary data regarding the burden of VTE in the outpatient versus inpatient cancer settings are lacking. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, observational, cohort study to examine the incidence of VTE in inpatients and outpatients with cancer utilizing a linked database formed from the US Premier Perspective\u2122 and the I3 Pharma Informatics healthcare claims databases, which provide data from the inpatient and outpatient settings, respectively. Patients with \u22651 inpatient or outpatient claims containing a diagnosis of cancer in any position (ICD-9-CM codes: 140.XX-208.99) from January 2005 to June 2009 were identified. VTE including deep vein thrombosis (DVT: ICD-9-CM codes 451 and 453) or pulmonary embolism (PE: ICD-9-CM codes 415.1\u2013415.19) occurring in the inpatient or outpatient setting were identified over the 12 months post-index period. Data regarding demographics, clinical characteristics and cost were assessed. Multivariate analyses were conducted to adjust for differences in patient characteristics before and after the index event. Results: A total of 17,874 patients with cancer were identified. Over the 12 months post-index period, 996 (5.6%) of these patients had VTE (mean age 59.6 years; 46.7% male) and 16878 (94.4%) patients did not (mean age 58.3 years; 46.3% male). Patients with VTE had a higher mean Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score at baseline than the non-VTE patients (0.9 vs. 0.7; P <0.001, respectively). Of patients with VTE, 731 (73.4%) had only DVT and 215 (21.6%) PE, while 50 (5.0%) had both. In multivariate analysis, predictors of VTE included primary site of cancer, particularly (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI]): stomach (2.24, 1.20\u20134.17; P <0.05); pancreas (2.29, 1.24\u20134.24; P <0.01); brain (1.82, 1.06\u20133.10; P <0.05); and testicular (3.06, 1.42\u20136.59; P <0.01). Increasing age (1.01, 1.00\u20131.02, P =0.001); increasing CCI score category (0.87, 0.72\u20131.06; P <0.05); history of pulmonary disease (1.26, 1.05\u20131.51; P <0.05); and post index use of doxorubicin (1.59, 1.15\u20132.21; P <0.01) were also significant predictors of VTE. A much higher proportion of VTE was diagnosed in the outpatient than the inpatient setting (78.3% versus 21.7%, P <0.0001). Of patients with outpatient VTE, 167 (21.4%) had a hospitalization within 30 days before their VTE index event. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, VTE was an independent predictor of hospitalization (OR 2.31, CI 1.92\u20132.78; P <0.0001). VTE was also an independent predictor of higher hospital costs ( P <0.0001).Total mean (SD) annual hospital costs were twofold elevated for patients with VTE in comparison with those who did not have VTE $22,917 (SD $14,005) versus $11,250 (SD $6,592) respectively ( P <0.0001) after adjusting for patient and treatment characteristics Conclusions: Over three-quarters of all VTE in cancer occurs in the outpatient setting and is associated with hospitalization and increased costs. One-fifth of outpatients with VTE however also had a recent hospitalization. Public health efforts to reduce the burden of VTE in cancer will need to focus on outpatient and post-discharge thromboprophylaxis in select high-risk patients, in addition to ongoing efforts to improve compliance with inpatient prophylaxis.
