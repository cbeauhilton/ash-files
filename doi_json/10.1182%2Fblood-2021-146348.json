    "abstract_text": "Therapeutic resistance and intolerance of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors is an emerging need in CLL. SYK is integral to the activation of BTK and the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling cascade and is overexpressed in CLL. We have shown that BAFF-mediated SYK activation triggered BCR signaling and rendered protection of CLL cells from spontaneous apoptosis in vitro . Single agent small molecule SYK inhibitor entospletinib was efficacious in treatment of patients with R/R CLL. Here we report final results of a single arm, open label, investigator-initiated phase 1/2 clinical trial which evaluated safety and efficacy of entospletinib in combination with obinutuzumab, a glycoengineered monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, in patients with R/R CLL (NCT03010358). Patients enrolled in the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the trial included adults with CLL or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Phase 1 part only) after \u22651 prior therapy. Patients were enrolled at 2 dose levels to receive entospletinib 200 or 400 mg twice-daily orally according to 3+3 design. The primary endpoint for the phase 1 portion of the study was to determine the RP2D of the combination. All patients received single agent entospletinib as part of a 7-day run-in. Thereafter, patients received entospletinib on days 1-28 of each 28-day cycle continuously, and obinutuzumab intravenously in standard doses for 6 cycles. Once the RP2D was determined, a phase 2 study enrolled patients with R/R CLL only, where complete response (CR) was the primary endpoint. A total of 24 patients (22 CLL, 2 follicular lymphoma) were enrolled. Twelve patients were enrolled in the phase 1 part of the study. The phase 2 part of the study included 17 patients with CLL. Of 6 patients who received entospletinib 200 mg on the Phase 1 part of the study, one patient experienced a DLT (grade 3 asymptomatic AST/ALT abnormalities) attributed to entospletinib. No DLTs were observed among the six patients who received entospletinib 400 mg. Thus, entospletinib 400 mg twice-daily was determined to be the RP2D in combination with obinutuzumab. Efficacy of entospletinib+obinutuzumab was analyzed in the 21 patients with CLL, of which 17 received entospletinib at RP2D (400 mg twice daily). Patients with CLL had a median age of 66 years. Thirteen patients (62%) had TP53 aberration (n=9), complex karyotype (n=6), or NOTCH1 or SF3B1 mutation. The median number of prior therapies was two (range, 1-6). Seven patients had received prior ibrutinib (4 patients discontinued due to intolerance and 2 due to progression). Median follow-up was 31 months. Among the 21 efficacy-evaluable participants with CLL, the ORR was 67% (95%CI, 43-85%). Three patients (14%, 95%CI 3-36%) achieved a CR, and 11 patients (53%) had a partial response (PR). patients with confirmed CR had undetectable MRD in the bone marrow. Median event-free survival was 27.5 months (95%CI: 16 months-NR), treatment duration - 31 months (95%CI: 27-40; Figure). Thirteen patients with high-risk CLL had an ORR of 54% (5 PRs and 2 CRs). Among the eight patients who had previously received kinase inhibitors, ORR was 62.5% (all PRs). Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 96% of patients (Table). Grade 3 or higher AEs occurred in 65%. Neutropenia (43.5%; including 4 patients [17%] who had transient grade 4 neutropenia attributed to obinutuzumab) was the most common grade \u22653 hematologic toxicity. The median onset of neutropenia was 7 days after the first obinutuzumab infusion, median duration was 28 days. Growth factor support was not required and grade \u22653 infection occurred in only 1 patient. Only one patient on study discontinued therapy due to adverse events (recurrent AST/ALT abnormalities which resolved upon cessation of entospletinib). Pharmacodynamic analysis demonstrated that treatment with entospletinib led to rapid downmodulation of pSTAT3 and the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1 in CLL cells. Furthermore, six months of combination therapy was accompanied by a reduction in IFN\u03b3 secretion in CD4 + T-cells and a reversal of exhausted phenotype, as evidenced by downregulation of PD-1. Thus, the combination of entospletinib and obinutuzumab shows an acceptable safety profile. Efficacy of this combination (EFS 27.5 months in predominantly high-risk population ) compares favorably with chlorambucil/obinutuzumab in R/R CLL (13 months), thus warranting continued exploration of the regimen.
