    "abstract_text": "Studies from recent years unraveled the role of monocytes and T-cells in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The role of other immune cells in the pathobiology of CLL is less known . Specifically, whether B-cells, the normal counterpart of CLL cells play a role in CLL is unknown . Nevertheless, since both CLL cells and wild type B-cells reside in lymphatic organs and travel in blood, they either share or compete over common environmental resources. According to the cell competition theory, a sensing mechanism measures the relative fitness of a cell and ensures the elimination of cells deemed to be less fit then their neighbors. Since constitutive activation of intracellular pathways protect CLL cells from apoptosis, the cell competition theory predicts that compared with normal B-cells these cells are sensed as \"super fit\" and B-cells, the less fit counterparts, are eliminated. Yet, what delivers this massage across a population of cells is unknown . Exosomes are nanosized particles that are secreted by various types of cells. Exosomes carry a cargo of proteins and different types of RNA. They travel in body fluids and are taken up by cells in their vicinity. Since cancer cells including CLL cells secrete exosomes, we have formulated our hypothesis, namely, that exosomes derived from CLL cells are the vehicles that carry a death massage to wild type B-cells. To test this hypothesis, we isolated CLL cells from 3 previously untreated patients with CLL. We then grew these cells in exosome free media for 72 hours and harvested the exosomes by ultracentrifugation. We used NanoSight tracking analysis, Western immunoblotting for CD63, a common exosomal marker, and electron microscopy imaging studies to ensure that our pellet include the typical 100nm exosomal particles. Subsequently, we subjected normal B-cells derived from healthy volunteers to CLL derived exosomes stained by FM-143 dye. Using flow cytometry we found that exosomes are taken up by normal B-cells in a dose- and time- dependent manner. Double staining of the recipient B-cells to Annexin/PI revealed that exosomes induce apoptosis of these cells in a dose- and time- dependent manner. We then used RNA-seq to trace the changes in the molecular makeup of B-cells after exosomal uptake?? they took up exosomes. We found 24 transcripts that were differentially expressed (11 that were upregulated and 13 that were downregulated). We then verified the array results by quantitative real-time PCR for four of these genes. Among the top transcripts that were upregulated in exosome-positive B-cells is SMAD6. Because the upregulation of the SMAD family members including SMAD6 is associated with the induction of apoptosis in various malignant and non-malignant cells we wondered whether the upregulation of SMAD6 also induces apoptosis in normal B-cells. To test this, we transfected normal B-cells with SMAD6 containing vector and verified by RT-PCR that level of SMAD6 transcript were upregulated and by Western immunoblotting that levels of SMAD6 protein are upregulated as well. As expected, the rate of apoptosis was higher, and the rates of viable cells and proliferating cells were significantly lower in SMAD6-transfected B-cells. Taken together, we show here that CLL cells secrete exosomes that function as \"Trojan horses\". Once they are taken up by normal B-cells they induce SMAD6-dependent apoptosis. In this way the neoplastic cells may actively eliminate their competitors and take over the common environmental resources. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
