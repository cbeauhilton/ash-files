    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4793 Blinatumomab is a CD19/CD3-bispecific antibody construct of the bispecific T cell engager (BiTE\u00ae) class showing as single agent a high rate and duration of responses in patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and B-precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Blinatumomab has a favorable safety profile with exception of a subset of patients developing neurological adverse events (AEs) during the first days of treatment, such as confusion, speech impairment or cerebellar symptoms. Thus far, all relevant neurological AEs (11 out of 48 patients) were transient, fully reversible and resolved without sequelae within 3 to 72 hours after stop of infusion. In no case, pathological findings were seen upon cranial magnetic resonance imaging. Despite treatment discontinuation, 4 patients with neurological AEs have achieved an objective lymphoma remission. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) taken within hours after stop of infusion showed detectable levels of blinatumomab in the majority of affected patients, while in one patient without neurological symptoms no blinatumomab was detectable in CSF during infusion. Moreover, increased levels of albumin and T lymphocytes in CSF support a disturbance of the blood brain barrier (BBB) as a possible underlying event. Analyses of patient serum samples for angiopoetin-2 and S100b are ongoing to investigate whether levels of the endothelial stress and BBB integrity marker, respectively, correlate with neurological AEs. In a retrospective analysis of 39 NHL patients, a baseline B cell to T cell (B:T) ratio in peripheral blood at or below 1:10 was identified as the only predictive factor for the subsequent occurrence of neurological AEs. The predictive value was then prospectively confirmed in 8 additional patients. Of note, ALL patients \u2013despite very low B:T ratios\u2013 rarely showed neurological AEs, which may relate to previous intrathecal chemotherapy depleting target cells in the brain. Potential mechanisms for the neuroprotective effect of peripheral B cells are being investigated. In conclusion, we identified a simple measure to prospectively identify patients at risk of developing neurological AEs after onset of blinatumomab treatment. Mitigating measures are currently tested in these high-risk patients in order to avoid discontinuation of treatment. Disclosures: Zugmaier: Micromet: Employment, Equity Ownership.
