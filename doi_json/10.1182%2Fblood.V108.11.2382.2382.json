    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND Polymorphisms in interleukin-10 (IL-10) genes can influence immune responses that may affect the outcome of lymphoid neoplasms. METHODS We analyzed two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (\u22121082 and \u22123575) in the IL-10 promoter region in 472 consecutive non-immunessuppresed cases diagnosed with lymphoid neoplasms. Genotypes were tested for an association with overall survival and classical prognostic factors by multivariate analysis, adjusted for clinical characteristics and other confounders. Haplotypes were reconstructed using haplo.stats package and their implications analyzed in lymphoma survival by multivariate analysis. RESULTS In our series, patients with IL-10 -3575AA genotype had a better overall survival (p= 0.002) for all lymphoid neoplasms as well as within the non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients (p=0.04). We also found that patients carrying the IL-10 -1082GG genotype presented a better median overall survival when compared to genotypes IL-10 -1082AA/AG. (p=0.05). When information on both genotypes were included in a multivariate analysis, IL-10 -3575AA was the only genotype identified as an independent prognostic factor for survival (HR=0.2, 95%CI 0.05\u20130.92). Haplotype analysis showed that patients with A-G/A-G diplotype had a longer overall survival (p=0.0042) and it appeared to be an independent prognostic factor for survival (HR:0.26; 95%CI 0.08\u20130.83). CONCLUSIONS IL-10 -3575AA and IL-10 -1082GG genotypes, together with A-G/A-G diplotype were identified as markers of a favorable lymphoma survival.",
