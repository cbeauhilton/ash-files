    "abstract_text": "Hemophilia A results from the quantitative or qualitative deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). FVIII is synthesized as a single-chain polypeptide of approximately 280 kDa with the domain structure A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. Whereas the A and C domains exhibit ~40% amino acid identity to each other and to the A and C domains of coagulation factor V, the B domain is not homologous to any known protein and is dispensable for FVIII cofactor activity. Missense mutations in the FVIII B domain have been described in patients with variable phenotypes of hemophilia A. According to the NCBI SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism) database, 22 SNPs are reported within FVIII, 11 of which occur within the B domain. FVIII B domain variant D1241E has been reported as a missense mutation associated with mild or severe hemophilia A, yet this mutation is also present in the NCBI SNPs database. We hypothesize that D1241E and most other reported B domain missense mutations are not the causative mutation for hemophilia A in these patients but represent SNPs or otherwise non-pathologic mutations. To investigate this, we analyzed 7 B domain missense mutations that were previously found in hemophilia A patients (T751S, V993L, H1047Y, D1241E, T1353A, P1641L and S1669L). Comparative analysis showed that the amino acids at these positions are not conserved in all species and in some cases, the amino acid substitution reported in hemophilia patients is represented in the native sequence in other species. Analysis with PolyPhen Software showed that only H1047Y mutation was considered as \u201cpossibly damaging\u201d, while the others were considered as \u201cbenign\u201d. To investigate this further, we constructed seven plasmid vectors containing these B domain missense mutations. The synthesis and secretion of FVIII wild-type (WT) and these seven mutants were compared after transient DNA transfection into COS-1 monkey cells in vitro. Analysis of the FVIII clotting activity and antigen levels in the conditioned medium demonstrated that all mutants had FVIII activity and antigen levels similar to FVIII WT. Further, FVIII WT, H1047Y and D1241E mutants were introduced into a FVIII exon 16 knock-out mouse model of hemophilia A by hydrodynamic tailvein injection in vivo. The mouse plasma was analyzed at 24 hrs for activity and antigen expression. Mutants H1047Y and D1241E expressed at 211 mU/mL and 224 mU/mL activity with FVIII antigen levels of 97 ng/mL and 118 ng/mL, respectively, similar to FVIII WT. These results suggested that H1047Y and D1241E mutants did not lead to impairments in secretion or functional activity. We conclude that most missense mutations within the FVIII B domain would be unlikely to lead to severe hemophilia A and that the majority of such missense mutations represent polymorphisms or non-pathologic mutations. Investigators should search for additional potentially causative mutations elsewhere within the FVIII gene when B domain missense mutations are identified."
