    "abstract_text": "Introduction. The vast majority of patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) have been shown to carry driver mutations of JAK2 , CALR (calreticulin gene) or MPL \u00ec, and these molecular leasions may impact the clinical course of the disease. In a recent paper (Blood 2014;124:1062) patients with CALR mutation, had a lower risk of developing anemia, thrombocytopenia, marked leukocytosis, thrombosis and showed better overall survival, than either JAK2 -mutant or triple-negative patients. Aim of the study. The aim of the present study was to assess whether CALR exon 9 mutation, conferred a survival advantage in MF patients undergoing a hemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Patients. All patients were selected for transplant by two authors (AB and GB) and grafted in Genova. Patients are outlined in 2 groups: 15 with CALR mutation and 31 with wild-type CALR ; the latter included 21 patients with JAK2 (V617F), 7 patients with MPL mutation and 3 patients triple negative. There were no significant differences, between the 2 groups in terms of DIPSS, spleen size, circulating CD34+ cell count, donor type, year of HSCT and conditioning regimens. Mutation status. Granulocyte JAK2 (V617F) mutation status and mutant allele burden were assessed using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based allelic discrimination assay on a Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time analyzer (Qiagen), as previously described. 1,2 Patients without JAK2 (V617F) were evaluated for MPL exon 10 mutations using a high-resolution melt (HRM) assay or Sanger sequencing. 3,4 Patients with nonmutated JAK2 and MPL were studied for CALR exon 9 mutations as reported in our original paper or by Sanger sequencing, as described elsewhere. 4 Results. With a median follow up of over 500 days for both groups, we could find no significant differences in CALR -mutated patients as compared to the remaining ones: transplant related mortality (26% vs 29%, respectively); relapse (20% vs 39%, p=0.2), relapse related death (20% vs 22%) and survival (47% vs 52%, p=0.7). When dissecting the patients with wild-type CALR , we could indeed see a survival advantage for the small number of MPL -mutated patients (n=7): when these were compared against all the others (n=39), again with similar disease and transplant characteristics, survival was 86% vs 44% (p=0.04) and relapse 14% vs 36% (p=0.2). In multivariate analysis, DIPPS was the only predictor of survival. Conclusions. These data suggests that CALR mutation does not confer a survival advantage in PMF patients undergoing an allogeneic HSCT. MPL mutation, on the other hand, though present in a very small number of patients, may be worth investigating further in a larger number of patients.
