    "abstract_text": "IDH mutations are strongly enriched in cytogenetically normal AML harboring NPM1 mutation (CN- NPM1 mut-AML). The impact of these mutations on response to treatment is still a matter of debate. In the ELN 2017 classification, NPM1 mut/ FLT3 -ITD allelic ratio >0.5 ( FLT3 -high) are considered intermediate-risk AML, whereas NPM1 mut/ FLT3 -ITD neg or <0.5 ( FLT3 -low) are low-risk. We aimed to evaluate the impact of IDH mutation in CN- NPM1 mut-AML patients (pts) treated intensively. For this purpose, we retrospectively analyzed 177 CN- NPM1 -AML pts from the Paoli-Calmettes Institute and from the French Innovative leukemia organization (FILO) databases who had received conventional intensive chemotherapy according to the FILO protocols (anthracycline-cytarabine based regimen for induction and High-intermediate dose cytarabine (HIDAC) for consolidation. Forty-seven (26%) AML pts had an IDH mutation -18 I DH1- R132 (10%), 27 IDH2- R140 (15%) and 2 IDH2- R172 (1%) - while 130 AML pts were IDH wt. Pts characteristics are presented in the Table.The complete response rate after one or two courses of chemotherapy (CR1) was 100% and 90% (p-value=.03) in the IDH mut and IDH wt groups, respectively. For pts in CR1, NPM1 molecular residual disease after the first consolidation (MRD2) was negative (>4 Log reduction) in 86% vs 53% of pts (p-value=.04). Nine (19%) and 24 (18%) pts received an allogeneic transplantation in CR1. The median time between CR1 and relapse was 11 months and 8 months, in IDH mut and IDH wt pts, respectively (p-value=.008). Day-100 non-relapse mortality was 8% and 12% respectively (p-value=ns). Median follow-up is 45 months (range, 2.4-115). Median EFS and OS are 21 months vs 12 months (p-value=.01) and 112 vs 23 months (p-value=.02), in the IDH mut vs IDH wt groups respectively (Figure). No survival differences were observed between IDH1 mut and IDH2 mut AML patients. Multivariate analyses with age>65, FLT3 -high and IDH mut as covariates showed that IDH mut was independently associated with a higher EFS (HR=1.7, ranges 1.1-2.6) and OS (HR=1.7, ranges 1.1-2.7). Our results suggest that IDH mut is associated with a better response and a good disease control with high-dose chemotherapy. Nevertheless, some relapses still occur justifying the use of an IDH inhibitor combined with first-line chemotherapy or in a post-remission maintenance setting.
