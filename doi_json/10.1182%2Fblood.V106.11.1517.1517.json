    "abstract_text": "We have recently reported that treatment of B-NHL cell lines with rituximab sensitizes the tumor cells to both chemotherapy and Fas-induced apoptosis ( Jazirehi and Bonavida, 2005 , Oncogene , 24 : 2121 \u20132145 ). This study investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of rituximab-mediated reversal of resistance. Treatment of B-NHL cell lines inhibited the constitutively activated NF- \u03baB. Cells expressing dominant active I\u03baB or treated with NF-\u03baB specific inhibitors were sensitized to both drugs and FasL agonist mAb (CH-11)-induced apoptosis. Downregulation of Bcl-xL expression via inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity correlated with chemosensitivity. The direct role of Bcl-xL in chemoresistance was demonstrated by the use of Bcl-xL overexpressing Ramos cells, Ramos HA-BclxL (gift from Genhong Cheng, UCLA), which were not sensitized by rituximab to drug-induced apoptosis. However, inhibition of Bcl-xL in Ramos HA-Bcl-x resulted in sensitization to drug-induced apoptosis. The role of Bcl-xL expression in the regulation of Fas resistance was not apparent as Ramos HA-Bcl cells were as sensitive as the wild type cells to CH-11-induced apoptosis. Several lines of evidence support the direct role of the transcription repressor Yin-Yang 1 (YY1) in the regulation of resistance to CH-11-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of YY1 activity by either rituximab, the NO donor DETANONOate, or following transfection with YY1 siRNA all resulted in upregulation of Fas expression and sensitization to CH-11-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest two complementary mechanisms underlying the chemo-sensitization and immuno-sensitization of B NHL cells by rituximab via inhibition of NF-\u03baB. The regulation of chemoresistance by NF-\u03baB is mediated via Bcl-xL expression whereas the regulation of Fas resistance by NF-\u03baB is mediated via YY1 expression and activity. These findings suggest that drug-resistant NHL tumor cells may be sensitive to immune-mediated therapeutics.",
