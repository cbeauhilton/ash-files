    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3598 Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) proteins have been found to play an important role in cancer cell survival and proliferation. The activation of STAT3 signalling pathways require interleukin-6 (IL6) and tyrosine kinase (JAK2) phosphorylation. Previous studies have shown that in patients with CLL elevated levels of serum IL6 correlate with adverse disease features and shorter survival. Methods: We investigated the relationship of CLL cell autocrine IL6 production, STAT3 activation and apoptosis resistance. Thirty-six CLL patients with high lymphocyte counts were investigated. Westen blot, flow cytometry, gene transfection and fluorescent microscopy techniques were used. Results: Autocrine IL6 production in CLL cells cultured for 24 hours was higher in Binet stage B/C patients (61pg/ml, range 1.4\u2013297pg/ml) as compared with stage A patients (6.1pg/ml, range 0\u201323pg/ml) (p=0.02). Patients with high autocrine IL6 production had a higher ratio of phosphorylated STAT3/ total STAT3, indicating a high level of STAT3 activation and apoptosis resistance. Activation of the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway by exogenous IL6 led to increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xl. STAT3 activation by exogenous IL6 led to increased resistance of CLL cells to spontaneous in vitro apoptosis (mean increase in viable cells over control: 15%, range 2\u201336%; p=0.00008). This was associated with preservation of mitochondrial function: decreased cytochrome C release (p=0.004), mitochondrial membrane potential collapse (p=0.0004) and ROS generation (p=0.0007). This study demonstrates that higher autocrine IL6 production by CLL correlates with STAT3 activation and apoptosis resistance in CLL. The IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway may reveal new therapeutic targets. Disclosures: Gribben: Roche: Consultancy; Celgene: Consultancy; GSK: Honoraria; Napp: Honoraria."
