    "abstract_text": "Introduction: ASP2215, a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) and AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, is currently in development for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods: In an ongoing, first-in-human Phase 1/2, dose-escalation/dose-expansion study, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of ASP2215 were evaluated under fasting conditions in patients with relapsed or refractory AML (R/R AML). Patients who met study criteria were assigned to treatment in the dose-escalation cohorts or were randomized to an open dose level in the dose-expansion cohorts. The dose-escalation cohort was a modified 3+3 with accelerated titration design that evaluated ascending oral doses of ASP2215 (20-450 mg), the dose-expansion cohort was a parallel, multi-dose-expansion cohort. Blood samples were collected and safety/tolerability assessments, including 12-lead electrocardiogram, were evaluated at protocol-specified time points for both cohorts. Effect of increasing ASP2215 exposure on inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation, assessed via plasma inhibitory assay (PIA), was evaluated using an inhibitory PK/PD E max model. PK/PD analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between ASP2215 exposure and changes from baseline in QTcF intervals (\u0394QTcF) and changes from baseline in clinical laboratory values (e.g., creatinine kinase [\u0394CK], aspartate aminotransferase [\u0394AST]). Results: Data from an interim analysis of the dose-escalation/dose-expansion study were available from 215 subjects (n=23 [dose escalation], n=192 [dose expansion]). The ASP2215 PK parameters across the dose range (20-450 mg), evaluated after both single- and multiple-dose administration, are presented (Table); statistical analyses suggest the ASP2215 PK parameters are dose proportional from 20-450 mg. Median time to maximal concentration (T max ) was observed between 2 hr and 6 hr after single and repeated oral dosing. The estimated median half-life (t 1/2 ) ranged from approximately 45 hr to 159 hr based on the accumulation ratio; ASP2215 accumulation was extensive after multiple dose administration as reflected by the accumulation index (R ac ) ranging from approximately 3.2-10. A strong correlation was shown for ASP2215 exposure-related inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation, with >90% FLT3 inhibition observed by Day 8 at ASP2215 doses of \u226580 mg. Although a positive slope was observed between \u0394QTcF and ASP2215 exposure, only 5% of the study population were reported as having a maximum post-baseline QTcF interval >500 msec. A similar trend was observed with ASP2215 concentration-related increases in \u0394CK and \u0394AST; however, <10% of all subjects experienced a Grade \u22653 shift from baseline in CK or AST concentrations. Conclusions: ASP2215 has demonstrated exposure-related FLT3 inhibition and a pharmacokinetic profile that support once-daily oral administration for the treatment of AML in subjects who relapsed after, or are refractory to, induction or salvage treatment.
