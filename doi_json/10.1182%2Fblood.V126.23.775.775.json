    "abstract_text": "KIT receptor signaling plays an important role in mast cell development. Gain-of-function mutations in KIT receptor have been identified in human diseases including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), systemic mastocytosis (SM) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although KIT mutations found in GIST are sensitive to imatinib, KIT mutation (KIT D816V ) found in 90% of SM patients is imatinib-resistant and currently no therapies are available to treat the human diseases associated with this mutation. Our recent studies have identified Ten-Eleven-Translocation 2 (TET2) mutations in ~23% of SM patients and are associated with poor prognosis and overall survival. TET2 is a methylcytosine dioxygenase that plays a vital role in active DNA demethylation. Recent studies suggest that patients with mutations in TET2 and KIT D816V develop more aggressive form of mastocytosis with worse prognosis. Although it is known that TET2 and KIT D816V cooperate in SM patients, it is not clear how they cooperate with each other and what is the physiologic role of TET2 in normal mast cell development. We show that loss of Tet2 results in impaired maturation of mast cells in vivo and in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) compared to WT controls, which is associated with reduction in 5-hmc levels compared to WT BMMCs. We also observed reduction in the expression of mast cell-specific genesincluding Mast cell proteinase-5 (MCP-5) , Mast cell proteinase-6 (MCP-6) and Carboxypeptidase A (CPA). To determine the mechanism behind altered mast cell differentiation in Tet2-/- BMMCs, we performed RNA-seq analysis in WT and Tet2-/- mast cells and observed altered expression of various genes involved in development of mast cells including Kit, Fc\u03b5R1, Mitf, Notch, and Myc. We further confirmed altered expression of Mitf, Gata-2, and PU.1 in Tet2-/- BMMCs compared to WT BMMCs by western blotting. Since Tet2 regulates DNA demethylation, we tested whether altered BMMC differentiation in Tet2-/- mice is due to enhanced DNA methylation. We treated WT or Tet2-/- BM cells for 3 weeks with vehicle or 5-azacytidine (hypomethylating agent) and analyzed mast cell differentiation. Treatment with 5-azacytidine completely corrected the defective mast cell differentiation in Tet2-/- cells to WT levels. These results suggest that Tet2 plays a significant role in mast cell differentiation by regulating the expression of critical transcription factors including Mitf, Gata-2 and PU.1. We next analyzed the growth of Tet2-/- BMMCs in response to cytokines. Tet2-deficient BMMCs show enhanced cytokine mediated growth compared to WT BMMCs. Hyper-proliferation of Tet2-/- BMMCs is associated with reduced expression of tumor suppressor, PTEN, whose promoter is hypermethylated and a concomitant increase in the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Since loss of function TET2 mutations have been observed in SM patients in addition to KIT D816V mutation, we tested whether loss of Tet2 cooperates with KIT mutation in vitro and in vivo . Tet2-deficiency or knockdown in conjunction with the expression of KIT mutation resulted in significantly enhanced growth compared to cells bearing KIT mutation alone or lacking Tet2 expression. Likewise in human mastocytosis xenograft model, significantly enlarged tumors were observed in NSG mice transplanted with human mastocytosis cell line bearing the KIT D816V mutation (HMC1.2) and knockdown of TET2 compared to HMC1.2 cells bearing only the KIT D816V mutation. The cooperation between loss of Tet2 and KIT mutation was associated with further increase in PI3K/AKT activation and pharmacologic inhibitor treatment with a PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 (Pan PI3K), but not TGX221 (p110\u03b2-specific) or IC87114 (p110\u03b4-specific), significantly reduced the hyper-proliferation of Tet2-/- BMMCs and cell lines as well as primary BM blasts derived from SM patients bearing the KIT D816V mutation. Consistently, combined loss of p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b4 subunits of PI3K resulted in the most profound growth repression in oncogenic KIT bearing BM cells, but did not correct altered differentiation in Tet2-/- BMMCs. Taken together our results suggest that combinational therapy involving 5-azacytidine (which corrects the impaired mast cell differentiation) and PI3K inhibitor (which corrects the excessive proliferation) is a better therapeutic option for treating human mastocytosis patients bearing TET2 and KIT mutations.
