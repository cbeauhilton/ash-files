    "abstract_text": "t(4;14) chromosome translocations are found in 15% of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) cases and are associated with high risk. MM cells with t(4;14) over-express the histone methyltransferase (HMT), WHSC1/MMSET/NSD2, which leads to deregulation of gene expression due to increased di-methylation of Histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me2). This activity has been shown to be essential for the survival of t(4;14) MM cells. In addition to WHSC1, another HMT, SETD2, has been shown to methylate H3K36. SETD2 is the only known enzyme capable of tri-methylation of H3K36 and has been reported to play a role in transcriptional elongation and alternative splicing. CRISPR pooled screening has shown that SETD2 activity is required for viability of a variety of cancer cell lines. This led Epizyme to develop small molecule inhibitors of SETD2 enzyme activity in order to understand the role of SETD2 in tumorigenesis. Through our drug discovery efforts, we identified EPZ-040414, a potent and selective inhibitor of SETD2 with low nM cell biochemical activity and broad selectivity against a panel of other HMTs. The proposed role of SETD2 in H3K36 methylation led us to test a panel of MM cells, including 6 t(4;14) cell lines with EPZ-040414. Inhibition of SETD2 resulted in reduced global tri-methylation of H3K36 in t(4;14) bearing MM cell lines. In contrast, there was no effect on global di-methyl H3K36 levels, indicating that WHSC1 activity is not affected by SETD2 inhibition. Moreover, 5/6 t(4;14) MM cell lines showed a cytotoxic response to treatment with EPZ-040414 with IC 50 s ranging between 60 and 200 nM, while all non-t(4;14) MM cell lines showed limited responses between 1 and 8 \u03bcM. Moreover, screening of a 280 cancer cell line panel with a SETD2 inhibitor showed minimal anti-proliferative activity in most cell lines tested. These findings show that t(4;14) MM cell lines require SETD2 activity for survival, suggesting that SETD2 inhibitors are strong candidates for the treatment of this high risk subgroup of MM. Efforts to further understand the interaction between SETD2 and WHSC1 in the molecular pathogenesis of t(4;14) myeloma will be presented. The current chemical series represented by EPZ-040414 is potent, selective, orally available, and currently under further evaluation for its therapeutic potential. Figure.
