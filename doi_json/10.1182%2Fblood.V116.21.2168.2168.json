    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2168 To identify molecular targets in leukemia stem cells (LSCs), this study compared the protein expression profile of freshly isolated LSCs (CD34 + /CD38 - compartment) with that of non-LSC (CD34 + /CD38 + compartment) counterparts from individuals with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). A total of 98 proteins were overexpressed, while six proteins were underexpressed in LSCs compared with their non-LSC counterparts. Proteins overexpressed in LSCs included a number of proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, gland differentiation, anti-apoptosis, adhesion, and drug resistance. Aberrant expression of CD82, a family of adhesion molecules, in LSCs was noted in additional clinical samples (n=6) by flow cytometry. In addition, we found that imatinib-resistant chronic eosinophilic leukemi EOL-1R cells expressed a greater amount of CD82 and remained in a dormant state compared to the parental EOL-1 cells. Interestingly, down-regulation of CD82 in EOL-1R cells by a small interfering RNA stimulated their migration capacity, as assessed by the transwell assay. These observations suggested that the aberrant expression of CD82 probably played a role in adhesion of hematopoietic cells to bone marrow microenvironment. Targeting CD82 could detach LSCs from bone marrow niche and sensitized these cells to anti-leukemia agents. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
