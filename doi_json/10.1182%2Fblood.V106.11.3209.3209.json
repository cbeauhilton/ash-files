    "abstract_text": "Factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitors have been classified as Type I, linear inactivation kinetics and complete inhibition of FVIII at saturation, or Type II, non-linear kinetics and residual FVIII activity. To investigate the hypothesis that \"inhibitor-blocking antibodies\" contribute to the characteristics of Type II inhibitors, mixing studies were performed between fractionated Type II antiserum and various Type I inhibitor preparations. Type II IgG fractions were tested for inhibitory capacity and ability to prevent inhibition mediated by inhibitors from other hemophiliacs. The IgG from Type II plasma (II) (29 BU, 8% FVIII) and several Type I plasmas ((I) plasmas) were fractionated with DEAE resin. Late-eluting Type II fractions (II):6 and (II):7, showed slight protection of FVIII from the inhibiting activity of several Type I plasmas and additive inhibition with others. When tested against Type I IgG fractions instead of type I plasmas, (II):6 and (II):7 provided significant protection of FVIII from the inhibitory action of some immunoglobulins and additive inhibition with others. When (II):6, which contained slightly less than 1 BU of inhibitory activity, was preincubated with normal plasma, it blocked about 3 BU of inhibitory activity in an equal volume of fraction (I):1; residual FVIII increased from 11.4% to 27.2%. IgG fraction (II):6 provided protection from DEAE fraction 2, (I):2, from another type I patient (residual FVIII went from 15.1% to 31.7%) but was additive with (I):4 from the same patient (residual FVIII went from 8.0% to 3.2%). Preincubation with (II):7 increased residual FVIII activity in normal plasma incubated with (I):1 from 10.1% to 20.7%. Fraction (II):7 was processed further by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl sepharose and two fractions, Phen(II):5 and Phen(II):6 provided significant protection of FVIII from inhibition by (I):1; residual FVIII activity increased from 11.5% to 34.1% and from 7.9% to 28.2%, respectively. DEAE fractions (II):6 and (II):7 were shown to contain anti-FVIII IgG. Depletion of mixtures of plasma or rFVIII and (II):6 with immobilized Protein A, reduced FVIII activity by 42.8% and 68.8%, respectively. In addition, adsorption of (II):6 with immobilized Protein A, eliminated its ability to block FVIII inhibition by (I):1. The co-existence of these antibodies in \"acquired hemophiliac\" plasma would contribute to the complex kinetics seen in these patients. If a sufficiently diverse panel of such blocking IgGs occurred naturally, or could be produced in the laboratory, and their interaction with the target antigen did not adversely affect the half-life, then these blocking antibodies might prove useful to alleviate the effects of inhibitory antibodies in hemophilia and other diseases.",
