    "abstract_text": "Recent studies by our laboratory have demonstrated unequivocally that factor V is endocytosed by megakaryocytes from plasma to form the platelet-derived factor V pool. In the current study, we have determined the time-dependent acquisition of factor V by platelets in a 67 year old factor V-deficient patient, previously shown to be completely devoid of plasma- and platelet-derived factor V. The patient now receives weekly tranfusions of two units of FFP to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding. Plasma and platelet lysate samples were prepared from fresh, whole blood drawn prior to (0 hrs), and following (2, 6, 24, 96, 168 hrs) patient transfusion. A factor V radioimmunoassay (RIA), which can detect factor V concentrations as low as 0.075 \u03bcg/mL, a standard factor V clotting-based activity assay, and/or western blotting analyses, which utilize a mixture of anti-human factor V light chain and heavy chain mAbs, were used to evaluate the appearance, and subsequent disappearance, of factor V in these two blood compartments. Prior to transfusion (t = 0 hr), the patient\u2019s plasma-derived factor V could not be detected by any of the three factor V assays. The patient\u2019s plasma-derived factor V level peaked immediately following transfusion (t = 2 hr) reaching a concentration of 1.3 +/\u2212 0.08 \u03bcg/mL as measured by RIA, and declined until it reached an undetectable level at 96 hrs post transfusion. These data were confirmed by the results of both the clotting-based assays and western blotting analyses. As the patient\u2019s platelet-derived factor V levels were below the sensitivity of both the RIA and clotting assay, they were analyzed by western blotting. Such analyses confirmed that subsequent to its endocytosis, the patient\u2019s platelet-derived factor V is stored in a partially protelytically activated form similar to that of a control individual. Due to the partially proteolytically activated state of the platelet-derived cofactor, platelet lysates treated with thrombin to activate the factor V to factor Va were used for quantative western blotting. Interestingly, and perhaps consistent with the patient\u2019s receipt of weekly FFP transfusions, factor V/Va could still be detected in platelets immediately prior to transfusion. Subsequent to transfusion and in marked contrast to changes in the plasma-derived cofactor pool, a significant increase in the patient\u2019s platelet-derived factor V/Va level was not observed until 24 hrs post transfusion. These data are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that platelets do not endocytose factor V. Although the concentration of the platelet-derived factor V/Va pool decreased over the subsequent 6 days, antigen remained detectable even though the plasma-derived pool had been depleted 3 days earlier. These combined observations indicate that, subsequent to FFP administration, the patient\u2019s megakaryocytes acquire and proteolytically process plasma-derived factor V normally. Furthermore, the consistent presence of factor V/Va within the patient\u2019s platelets is in all likelihood preventing gastrointestinal bleeding in this individual, which supports the concept that platelet-derived factor V represents the hemostatically relevant factor V pool.",
