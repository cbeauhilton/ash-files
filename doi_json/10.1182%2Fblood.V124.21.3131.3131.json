    "abstract_text": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a myeloproliferative disorder, characterized by sustained neutrophilia and constitutive BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity. Constitutive expression of the BCR-ABL kinase and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels through mitochondria and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) activation leads to genomic instability and enhanced cell survival. Nitric oxide (NO), a signaling molecule has been associated with hematopoesis and suppression of NOS activity may induce profound changes in hematopoietic stem cells/progenitor cells. NO addition or iNOS transfection in K562 cells (BCR-ABL + ) altered genes expression involved in the iron metabolism, inhibited cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis, which were reversed by addition of exogenous iron. Moreover, anti-cancer effect of farnesyltransferase inhibitor in these cells was also mediated by NO production/iNOS induction. The present study investigates status and regulation of NO/iNOS in neutrophils from CML patients.The present study was undertaken to explore NO generation/iNOS expression and its regulation in circulating neutrophils so as to access the role NO/iNOS in CML pathology. All CML patients (Drug/treatment na\u00efve, n=70; imatinib responders, n=62; imatinib resistant, n=25) included in this study were diagnosed in chronic phase. The study protocol was approved by the ethical committees of CSIR-CDRI and KGMU, Lucknow and was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. Total nitrite level in neutrophils (PMNs) was assessed by Griess reagent. Nitric oxide, Superoxide, ROS/RNS and mitochondrial ROS generation was assessed by DAF-2DA, DHE, DCF-DA and Mitosox Red respectively. H 2 O 2 was measured by Amplex red assay kit. Expression of iNOS gene was evaluated by a SYBR green real-time RT-PCR and Western blot. Binding of NF-kB (p50 and p65 subunit) to iNOS promoter was analysed by CHIP assay. NF-kB (p50 and p65 subunit) and procaspase-3 glutathionylation was assessed by Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot. Findings in CML patients were further validated using in vitro experiments on K562 cells. Statistical analysis were performed by one way ANOVA test followed by Newman-Keul\u2019s post hoc analysis using the Graph Pad prism software. PMNs total nitrite, NO level and iNOS expression in drug na\u00efve and imatinib resistant patients were significantly less as compared to healthy subjects. However, significant recovery in all the parameters was observed in imatinib responsive patients. Superoxide, ROS/RNS, mitochondrial ROS generation as well as H 2 O 2 level was significantly more in drug na\u00efve and imatinib resistant patients and it was attenuated significantly in imatinib responsive patient\u2019s PMNs. In vitro treatment of K562 cells with Imatinib (2\u00b5M) also showed augmented NO generation and iNOS expression, while superoxide, ROS/RNS and mitochondrial ROS generation was decreased. To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of iNOS in BCR-ABL+ cells, we examined binding of NF-\u03baB to iNOS promoter/enhancer and protein S-glutathionylation. Binding of NF-\u03baB (p50 and p65 subunits) to iNOS promoter/enhancer was less in BCR-ABL positive cells, while it was augmented following treatment with imatinib. Moreover, glutathionylation of p50, p65 and procaspase-3 was more in drug na\u00efve as well as in imatinib resistant CML patients PMNs, while it was comparable to healthy subjects in imatinib responders CML patients PMNs. Glutathionylation of NF-\u03baB (p50 and p65 subunit) and procaspase-3 was also attenuated in imatinib treated K562 cells. The results obtained suggest that reduced NO generation/iNOS expression in BCR-ABL positive cells was due to the S-glutathionylation of NF-\u03baB, which decrease it\u2019s binding to iNOS promoter. S-glutathionylation of procaspase-3 in CML however, inhibited apoptosis of BCR-ABL positive cells. The study thus highlights importance of S-glutathionylation as key regulators involved in the proliferation and apoptosis of BCR-ABL positive cells.
