    "abstract_text": "ZAP-70 is a prognostic marker in CLL and has been shown to correlate closely with V H mutational status in most studies. Assays that require the setting of markers using either T-cells, or a matched isotype control to determine ZAP-70 expression in CLL are subjective and prone to analytical and inter-operator variability. We examined the use of the KS statistical test to analyze histogram overlays as an objective approach to the assessment of ZAP-70 expression in 18 CLL patients with known V H mutational status (V H mutated; n=11, V H unmutated; n=7). Use of the KS statistical test to compare ZAP-70 expression of T cells with B cells in CLL has been recently described by Van Bockstaele et al .(Cytometry Part B 70B:302-308. 2006). In contrast to this approach we used a B cell gating assay with a pre-conjugated alexa-fluor 488 ZAP-70 antibody clone 1E7.2 and an alexa-fluor 488 matched isotype control manufactured by Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, CA) as previously described by our group. Modifications were made to allow the determination of KS \u2018D\u2019values. Statistical analysis of our resulting KS data using a t-test demonstrated a significant difference in ZAP-70 KS \u2018D\u2019 values between the two V H mutational groups (p=0.0001). All patients with a KS \u2018D\u2019 value of 0.5 or below were V H mutated, whilst all patients with a KS \u2018D\u2019 value of 0.7 or above were V H unmutated, with some cross-over between these values. At a threshold KS \u2018D\u2019 value of 0.6, 10 of the 11 V H mutated patients were correctly classified (1 patient had a \u2018D\u2019 value of 0.68), whilst 6 of the 7 V H unmutated patients were correctly classified (1 patient had a \u2018D\u2019 value of 0.59) The sensitivity and specificity of using a threshold KS \u2018D\u2019 value of 0.6 was 86% and 91% respectively. Analysis of ZAP-70 expression using the KS statistic is operator independent and thus provides a means for a more reproducible analytical approach in the laboratory. We acknowledge that our initial sample size was small and requires further investigation using a larger sample size to fully validate the diagnostic value of using KS \u2018D\u2019 values to determine ZAP-70 expression in CLL.",
