    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4794 Background In surface antigen of hepatitis B virus (HBsAg)-positive carrier for anticancer treatment of malignant lymphoma, it is well recognized that reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) occasionally occurs. However, there have been only a few studies of HBV reactivation in serum HBsAg-negative and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb)-positive occult HBV carriers. We looked at both retrospective and prospective studies to determine the prevalence, clinical course and risk factor of HBV reactivation during chemotherapy in lymphoma patients. Patients and methods Forty-nine of 128 (38.3%) lymphoma patients were HBsAg negative and HBcAb positive, and 25 of these patients were then given liver function tests and HBsAg tests monthly and serum HBV DNA every 3 months. Results HBV reactivation was observed in two patients (4.0%) who had received intensive chemotherapy including steroid and rituximab. Immediate administration of entecavir therapy after elevation of HBV DNA level was conducted, and this resulted in reduction of it and improvement of liver function test. Conclusions Rituximab plus steroid-containing regimens may increase the risk of HBV reactivation in HBsAgnegative and HBcAb-positive lymphoma patients. More ambitious prospective studies are required to establish clinically useful or cost-effective follow-up methods for control of HBV reactivation in lymphoma patients with occult HBV infection.
