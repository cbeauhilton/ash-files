    "abstract_text": "Cell death by apoptosis accounts for the ineffective erythropoiesis that characterizes low grade myelodysplastic syndromes (LG-MDS). We have shown that the death receptor Fas was over-expressed at the surface of LG-MDS erythroid precursors. In an ex vivo culture of bone-marrow CD34 + cells undergoing differentiation into red cells, we observed that apoptosis of LG-MDS erythroid precursors resulted from Fas-mediated activation of caspase-8. Both a Fas-Fc construct and the ectopic expression of a dominant negative mutant of the adaptor FADD (Fas-Associated Death Domain) could prevent the death of MDS erythroid precursors. In this ex vivo culture system, apoptosis of erythroid precursors was associated with the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol. To further address the mitochondria involvement in this apoptotic process, we ectopically expressed, by the use of a lentiviral vector, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in MDS (n=20) and normal (n=10) CD34 + cells before inducing their erythroid differentiation. Bcl-2 expression delayed the erythroid differentiation of MDS as well as normal CD34 + cells. It also prevented phosphatidylserine exposure, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c release, caspase-9 and -3 activation in LG-MDS erythroid precursors. Together with the cleavage of Bid, specifically observed in LG-MDS samples, these observations indicated that the Fas-mediated pathway that led to apoptosis of LG-MDS erythroid precursors was connected to the mitochondrial pathway to death. We also addressed the role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in this death pathway by using a lentiviral vector encoding an ER-targeted Bcl-2 construct, flag-Bcl2-Cb5. The corresponding protein co-localized with the ER protein calreticulin. ER-targeted Bcl-2 prevented apoptosis induced by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic ATPases (SERCAs), without inhibiting apoptosis induced by lonidamine, a mitochondria targeting agent. Like wild-type Bcl-2, ER-targeted Bcl-2 inhibited phosphatidylserine exposure, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c release, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation that characterize spontaneous apoptosis of LG-MDS erythroid precursors in culture. Although ER calcium stores were increased in LG-MDS erythroid precursors, the release of calcium was not modulated by ER-targeted Bcl-2 in these cells. Altogether, our results indicate that, in LG-MDS erythroid precursors, spontaneous apoptosis starts at level of the death receptor Fas, then connects to the mitochondrial pathway that functions downstream of the ER through a calcium-independent and Bcl-2-regulated pathway."
