    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Despite recent advancements in treatment for multiple myeloma (MM) there is a constant need for newer therapies to tackle the complex issue of relapse and therapy after relapse for patients with MM. Ibrutinib is an oral inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), which is overexpressed in the plasma cells. We conducted a comprehensive literature search to analyze the efficacy, dosing and toxicity profile of ibrutinib in relapsed MM. METHODS : Database search using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Clinicaltrials.gov was performed on 06/05/18 (last update) . All clinical trials that used ibrutinib either as monotherapy or in combination regimens in the setting of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) were included. RESULTS: A total of 388 articles were found on the initial search and after screening, three phase I and II clinical trials qualified for inclusion. Ibrutinib based regimen data (n=155 patients) was analyzed (Table 1). Majority (68%) of the patients were refractory to their previous line of therapy. Ibrutinib Monotherapy : Monotherapy (n=31) with a dose of 420 mg/d to 840 mg/d demonstrated a 0% ORR (overall response rate). A median PFS (progression-free survival) of 0.9 to 2.8 months was noticed with ibrutinib monotherapy. Most common hematological adverse events (HAE) noted were anemia (32%), thrombocytopenia (29%) and neutropenia (13%). All-grade gastrointestinal disturbances (GI) were observed in 90% of cases, fatigue and respiratory infections (RI), each in 39% and muscle spasms in 23% of cases. Ibrutinib + Dexamethasone : The addition of 40 mg dexamethasone to 560 mg/d (n=18) and 840 mg/d (n=43) ibrutinib showed an ORR of 6% and 5% and reported median PFS of 3.7 months and 4.6 months, respectively. Side effects included anemia (26%), thrombocytopenia (23%), and neutropenia (2%). GI toxicity was noted in 82% patients, fatigue in 46%, RI in 15% and muscle spasms reported in 15% patients. Ibrutinib + Carfilzomib : At 560 mg/d dose of ibrutinib, the addition of 27 mg/m 2 (n=3) and 36 mg/m 2 of carfilzomib (n=5) showed a response of 67% and 40%, respectively. The best response was elicited when 20 mg of dexamethasone was added to 36 mg/m 2 of carfilzomib and ibrutinib at a dose of 840 mg/d (n=18; ORR: 71%) and 560 mg/d (n=17; ORR: 71%). The median duration of responses was 12.9 months. Minimal responses were observed in an additional 4 patients giving an overall clinical benefit rate of 76%. At a dose of 36 mg/m 2 of carfilzomib, median PFS was reported as 8.1 and 6.4 months at 560 mg/d and 840 mg/d doses of ibrutinib, respectively. Most common HAE were anemia (35%), thrombocytopenia (28%) and neutropenia (9%). Eighty-six percent of patients developed GI disturbances while fatigue and muscle spasms were noted in 53% and 19%, respectively. RI were observed in 51% of patients. Ibrutinib + Bortezomib : The combination of ibrutinib given at 840 mg/d dose with a twice weekly dose of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m 2 elicited a response in 46% (n=20) patients, and minimal responses in 4 (21%) patients. Most common GI disturbance was diarrhea (50%). Upper respiratory infections were noted in 30% cases while, asthenia and peripheral edema seen in 20% of cases. Bortezomib/IMiD Refractory Cohort : Patients refractory to prior bortezomib (n=27) showed an encouraging ORR of 73% that was durable for a median of 9.1 months when ibrutinib+carfilzomib+dexamethasone regimen was used. Similarly, another cohort (n=25) of double refractory patients treated with a combination of ibrutinib and dexamethasone demonstrated minimal response in 4 (16%) and disease stabilization in another 5 (20%) patients. High-Risk Cohort : In a population of high-risk cytogenetics (del 17p and/or t[4;14]; n=11) treated with 560 mg/dl to 840 mg/dl of ibrutinib, 36 mg/m 2 of carfilzomib and (+/-) 20 mg of dexamethasone showed an ORR of 78%, response was durable for a median of 9.1 months, and achieved a median progression free survival (PFS) of 8.1 months . CONCLUSION: Ibrutinib has demonstrated a promising efficacy (70-80% of ORR in combination regimens) along with an acceptable toxicity profile in the heavily pre-treated and dual drug refractory MM patients. Larger prospective clinical trials are needed to further evaluate its efficacy.
