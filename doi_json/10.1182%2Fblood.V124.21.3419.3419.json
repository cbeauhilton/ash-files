    "abstract_text": "Detection of an M-protein (monoclonal immunoglobulin) has been used to diagnose and monitor multiple myeloma (MM). As therapies for MM have improved, more sensitive methods have been used to define response: immunofixation electrophoresis (IFX) of serum and urine, normalization of the serum immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) ratio, and high sensitivity flow cytometry to detect clonal plasma bone marrow cells. It is hoped that these more sensitive approaches will differentiate those patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) versus no residual disease (NRD), that later which could mean a cure. Flow cytometry of plasma cells requires bone marrow aspiration, which is inconvenient and expensive and is potentially limited by sampling bias. More sensitive methods to differentiate MRD from NRD using serum would be advantageous. We have developed a sensitive test for the presence of the monoclonal antibody produced by the plasma cells which may serve as a substitute for invasive bone marrow biopsy. Briefly, patient serum is enriched for immunoglobulins (Ig) and the Ig light chains are decoupled from the heavy chain by reduction with DTT. The mass distribution of the light chains is resolved using a micro LC-ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometry and the presence of the M-protein is detected as a spike in the mass distribution. In addition to the detection, the accurate mass measurement of the light chain serves as a unique individualized marker which can aid in detection in subsequent patient monitoring. We have termed this method: m onoclonal- i mmunoglobulin- R apid- A ccurate- M ass- M easurement (miRAMM). By spiking monoclonal immunoglobulins into human serum, we have demonstrated that miRAMM is approximately 1000x more sensitive than SPEP at detecting M-proteins. Initial results on 21 patients in stringent complete response (sCR) demonstrated that 67% (n=14) had detectable malignant specific clones by miRAMM. Given these promising results we have extended the method to a larger series of myeloma patients for whom we had long term follow-up and serum samples prior to treatment and at 6-12 months status post stem cell treatment. The results of this data will be correlated to the clinical outcomes for these patients. Early results demonstrate the potential of miRAMM to be a more sensitive, cost effective approach to detect MRD compared with current methods.
