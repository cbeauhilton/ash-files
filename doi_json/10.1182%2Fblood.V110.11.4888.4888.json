    "abstract_text": "Although acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can be cured with intensive treatment including myeloablative chemotherapy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, relapses occur in the majority of cases. A common feature of tumor cells is their ability to escape immune surveillance through adapted intrinsic mechanisms. Thus, it is a great challenge to develop optimal strategies that direct a specific cellular immune response against residual AML blasts in vivo . As CD4 + T cells are needed to initiate a strong anti-leukemic CD8 + T cell response, the mechanism through which HLA class-II restricted (leukemia-specific) antigens are presented on AML blasts could be an essential factor in immune surveillance. Previously, we showed that the self peptide Class-II Associated Invariant Chain Peptide (CLIP) important in HLA class-II antigen presentation appeared to be disadvantageous, as its expression on AML blasts predicted a shortened disease-free survival ( Chamuleau et al. Canc. Res.  2004 ; 64 (16): 5546 \u201350 ). We hypothesized that CLIP interferes with the presentation of specific tumor antigens on HLA class-II molecules, thereby preventing recognition of AML blasts by CD4 + T cells. To investigate whether CLIP expression indeed has a functional effect on leukemia-specific T cell activation in patients, an AML cell line model with CLIP + and CLIP \u2212 leukemic blasts was set up. The Kasumi-1 and THP-1 AML cell lines were selected as both stained positive for extracellular HLA-DR (89%; MFI=31.3 and 91%; MFI=37.5 respectively) and CLIP expression (88%; MFI=37.2 and 91%; MFI=34.0 respectively) by flow cytometric analysis. These DR + CLIP + cell lines were specifically silenced for Invariant Chain (Ii) expression using RNA interference to down-modulate CLIP presentation on the cell surface. Indeed, Ii siRNA-treated cells not only showed a significant decrease of intracellular Ii expression (MFI decrease of 87.7% for Kasumi-1 and 82.7% for THP-1), but also a marked downregulation of relative CLIP amount per HLA-DR molecule (fold decline in CLIP/DR ratio of 1.4 for Kasumi-1 and 2.0 for THP-1). Wild type (DR + CLIP + ) and modulated (DR + CLIP \u2212 ) cells of Kasumi-1 or THP-1 origin acted as stimulators for alloreactive CD4 + T cells in mixed leukocyte reactions using different stimulator to responder (S/R) ratios. Modulated DR + CLIP \u2212 Kasumi-1 and THP-1 cells induced a strong increase in alloreactive CD4 + T cell proliferation as compared to DR + CLIP + wild type controls, both in an HLA-DR-specific and a S/R-dependent manner. At the highest S/R ratio, mean proliferation increases of 2.58-fold for Kasumi-1 (n=3) and 1.71-fold for THP-1 (n=2) were observed. These data support our hypothesis that the expression of CLIP on AML blasts plays an important role in immune surveillance, which might have impact on cellular immunotherapy with dendritic cell-based vaccines in AML.",
