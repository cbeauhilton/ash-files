    "abstract_text": "The oncogene c-maf is frequently over-expressed in multiple myeloma cell lines and patient samples and contributes to increased cellular proliferation in part by inducing cyclin D2 expression. Therefore, small molecules that inhibit c-maf and its targets could be useful chemical probes to better understand the role and regulation of this protein. We developed a high throughput chemical screen in NIH 3T3 cells stably over-expressing the promoter of the c-maf target cyclin D2 driving firefly luciferase. From a screen of 2400 off-patent drugs and chemicals, we identified 32 compounds that preferentially reduced cyclin D2 transactivation. Of these, 24 of the 32 hits belonged to the corticosteroid family of drugs. Indeed, the screen identified 24 of the 26 corticosteroids in the library. The most potent inhibitors were glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone. Mineralocorticoids such as fludrocortisone were weak hits, reflecting their weak glucocorticoid activity. The 24 glucocorticoids identified in this screen preferentially reduced cyclin D2 transactivation in the presence of c-maf. For example, the IC 50 of dexamethasone was 11 \u00b1 0.7 nM and >50 uM in NIH 3T3 cell with and without c-maf, respectively. Given the effects of glucocorticoids on c-maf in NIH 3T3 cells, we extended our investigation to multiple myeloma cell lines and demonstrated that nanomolar concentrations of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone reduced levels of c-maf protein and its target cyclin D2 within 6 hours of treatment. C-Maf was down regulated in isogenic MM1.S but not MM1.R cells respectively sensitive and resistant to dexamethasone. We also observed reductions in another c-maf target, beta integrin. Compared to cell lines RPMI 8226 and OCIMY5 that harbor the t(14;16) c-maf translocation, the concentration of dexamethasone required to reduce c-maf was approximately 50-fold lower in cell lines such as LP1 and OPM1 that lack the translocation but over-express c-maf. While dexamethasone reduced c-maf protein, no changes in levels of c-maf mRNA were detected. In both multiple myeloma and NIH3T3 cells, dexamethasone increased the ubiquitin-dependent destruction of c-maf. Finally, we linked glucocorticoids to c-maf ubiquitination by demonstrating that dexamethasone upregulated ubiquitin C mRNA at concentrations associated with the ubiquitination of c-maf. Moreover, ectopic expression of ubiquitin cDNA recapitulated the effects of dexamethasone and reduced levels of c-maf, suggesting that increased expression of ubiquitin C by dexamethasone is functionally important for dexamethasone\u2019s effects on c-maf levels. Conclusion: a chemical biology screen identified glucocorticoids as c-maf dependent inhibitors of cyclin D2 transactivation. Glucocorticoids reduce c-maf by promoting its ubiquitination via the upregulation of ubiquitin C mRNA. This work provides new insights into the regulation of c-maf and has identified a novel mechanism by which glucocorticoids exert an anti-myeloma effect."
