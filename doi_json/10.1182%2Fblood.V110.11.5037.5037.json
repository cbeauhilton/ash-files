    "abstract_text": "Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) has a high incident in Japanese. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) against ATL made the patients\u2019 survival longer than chemotherapy alone. Actually, some of them became long survivors (LS). The efficacy of allo-SCT for ATL was examined and the prognostic factors were discussed. We retrospectively surveyed the data of ATL patients who underwent allo-HSCT at our hospital between June 1997 and June 2007. The results of allo-HSCT in ATL patients (n=35) including acute type (n=18) and lymphoma-type (n=17) were analyzed retrospectively. Donors were HLA-related relation in 24 patients (69%) or unrelated volunteers in 11 patients (31%). Twelve patients (34%) were in complete remission (CR) before conditioning regimen. Twenty-one (60%) received a conventional stem cell transplantation (CST) and 14 (40%) received a reduced intensity stem cell transplantation (RIST). Because transplant related mortality (TRM) and relapse are mainly observed within day 100, we divided the patients into short survivors (SS) who died within day 100 and LS who were alive more than one year after allo-HSCT. The median survival time (MST) of SS and LS were 55.6 (10\u201399) days and 1241.3 (503\u20132492) days. Most of LS (8 of 10) showed CR as status of ATL before allo-HSCT and all LS were received CST but not RIST. Response of induction chemotherapy and following CST are important factors for the success of allo-HSCT for ATL as a promising consolidation therapy. Characteristics of patients  ATL subtype .
