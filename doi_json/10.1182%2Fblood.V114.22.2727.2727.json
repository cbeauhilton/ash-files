    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2727 Poster Board II-703 INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to determine activity and safety of weekly bortezomib and rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM). METHODS: Patients who had at least one previous therapy were eligible. All patients received bortezomib IV weekly at 1.6 mg/m 2 on days 1, 8, 15, q 28 days x 6 cycles, and rituximab 375 mg/m 2 weekly on cycles 1 and 4. Primary endpoint was the percent of patients with at least a minor response. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were treated. Majority of patients (78%) completed treatment per protocol. At least minimal response (MR) or better was observed in 81% (95% CI: [65,92]) with 2 patients (5%) in complete remission (CR)/near CR, 17 (46%) in partial response (PR), and 11(30%) in MR. The median time to progression was 16.4 months (95% CI, 11.4\u201321.1). Death occurred in 1 patient due to viral pneumonia. The most common grade 3 and 4 therapy related adverse events included reversible neutropenia in 16%, anemia in 11%, and thrombocytopenia in 14%. Grade-3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in only 2 patients (5%). The median event-free survival (EFS) is 12 months (95% CI, 11\u201320) with estimated 12 month and 18 month EFS of 49% (95% CI: [31, 67%]) and 38% (95% CI: [20, 56%]). The median overall survival has not been reached. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of weekly bortezomib and rituximab showed significant activity and minimal neurological toxicity in patients with relapsed WM.
