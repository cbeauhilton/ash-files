    "abstract_text": "Background: Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a relatively common subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) that typically presents with lymphadenopathy, extranodal disease, including rash, and is associated with frequent infections due to immune dysregulation. Patients with AITL generally have a poor prognosis, even with aggressive chemotherapy as responses to standard chemotherapy are often suboptimal. Recent advances in cancer biology suggest that AITL is derived from T-follicular helper cells and is often characterized by gross epigenetic dysregulation. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have demonstrated significant activity in T-cell neoplasms. The BELIEF trial established an overall response rate of 25% in patients with relapsed/refractory PTCL who were treated with belinostat, with a duration of response of about 1 year, leading to accelerated approval. Herein, we present a subset analysis of the data for patients with AITL. Method s: Patients with histologically confirmed PTCL (N = 129) who experienced failure with or refractory to \u2265 1 prior systemic therapy received belinostat 1,000 mg/m(2) as daily 30-minute infusions on days 1 to 5 every 21 days. Central assessment of response used International Working Group criteria. Primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DoR) and progression-free and overall survival (PFS). Results: Of 129 patients, 22 patients had AITL; most had advanced disease (91% stage III/IV; 36% with bone marrow involvement). The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 1-5), and 3 (14%) patients were refractory to their last line of therapy. The ORR for patients with AITL was 46% (10/22; 95%CI: 24 - 68%), with a complete response (CR) in 4 of 22 patients (18%). Of the ten responders, the median time to response of 11.3 weeks (range, 4.7 - 24.4 weeks) in the AITL subgroup. After a median follow up of 21.5 months, the median PFS was 4.2 months (95%CI: 1.5 -13.9) and the median DOR was 13.6 months (95%CI: 1.4 - 29.4) as shown in Figure 1 . For all patients with AITL treated with belinostat, the median OS was 9.2 months (95%CI: 6.8 - 21.5). The most common grade 3 to 4 adverse events were asthenia (n=2), fatigue (n=2), anemia (n=2), thrombocytopenia (n=2), neutropenia (n=2), and septic shock (n=2). Conclusions: Single-agent belinostat induced rapid and durable responses in patients with relapsed/refractory AITL. At the end of the study, there were 37% patients with ongoing responses at 2 years. Patients with clinical benefit from belinostat continued treatment until progression of disease. These results support the use of belinostat in relapsed/refractory AITL as a single agent and provide rationale for combination therapies in clinical trials.
