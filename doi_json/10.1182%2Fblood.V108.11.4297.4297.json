    "abstract_text": "Objective:The distinct proteins of leukemic cells were investigated by proteomics technology between AML-M 2 a patients before inductive treatments with evidently different duration of first continuous complete remission(CCR 1 ) and AML-M 2 a patients at replase in order to find their relations with prognosis of AML-M 2 a. Methods:The bone marrow mononuclear cells(BMMNCs) from 17 cases of AML-M 2 a patients before inductive treatment were grouped with different duration of CCR 1 : group A with CCR 1 duration exceeded 12 months(11 cases), group B within 6 months(6 cases), and group C was composed of 3 patients at replase among group B. The proteins of BMMNCs from all the patients were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and the part of differentially-expressed proteins were identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry(MALDI-TOF-MS). Results: 6 differentially-expressed proteins were identified between group A and B by MALDI-TOF-MS: tubulin-specific chaperone B, myeloperoxidase, Solution Structure Of The Ch Domain Of Human Transgelin-2, glutathione S-transferase, RING zinc finger protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.3 differentially-expressed proteins were identified in group C: NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, hypothetical protein, HES1. Conclusion: The distinct proteins of leukemic cells of AML-M 2 a patients before inductive treatments were involved in prognosis, and the proteins of BMMNCs from patients at replase have changed.",
