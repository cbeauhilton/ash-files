    "abstract_text": "Background: IO was found to be highly active in pts with refractory-relapsed ALL, with an overall response rate of 58% and a median survival of 6.3 months (mos). Identifying factors associated with different outcomes on IO therapy may help select patients for this treatment and advice of prognosis. Methods: A total of 89 pts treated with IO on previous studies were analyzed. IO was given at 1.3-1.8 mg/m 2 IV x 1 every 3-4 weeks or weekly (0.8 mg/m 2 Day 1, 0.5 mg/m2 Days 8 and 15) every 3-4 weeks. Pretreatment factors associated with achieving marrow complete response (CR) and with survival were analyzed using standard statistical methods. Results: Baseline characteristics of the 89 pts are summarized in Table 1. Overall, 17 pts (19%) achieved CR, 29 (33%) had CRp, and 6 pts (7%) had bone marrow CR with incomplete recovery (Cri). 5 pts (6%) died within 4 weeks of starting therapy. The ORR was 58%. The rate of cytogenetic CR by morphologic responses was as follows: 8 cytogenetic CR/10 morphologic CR (80%); 16 cytogenetic CR/22 morphologic CRp (73%); and 4 cytogenetic CR/4 morphologic CRi (100%). The median survival of patients with at least marrow CR was 9 mos versus 3.4 mos for those without marrow CR (p<0.001). By multivariate analysis, a high peripheral blood absolute blast count (ABC) and low platelet count were independently associated with a lower likelihood of achieving at least marrow CR. With a median follow-up of 23 mos, (5-44), the median overall survival of pts who received IO was 6 mos; the median survival was 5 mos with the single-dose schedule and 9.5 mos with the weekly schedule. The median remission duration was 12 mos (1-year rate, 48%) ( Figure 1 A). Baseline characteristics independently associated with worse survival included adverse cytogenetics [complex karyotype, translocation (4;11), translocation (9;22), abnormal chromosome 17], disease beyond first salvage, and high peripheral blood ABC. Pts with 0, 1-2 or 3 adverse factors had a median survival of 42+, 7.5, and 2.4 mos, respectively ( Figure 1 B). To assess the benefit of achieving a marrow CR, we repeated the multivariate survival analysis using a 6-week landmark that excluded 5 pts who died within 6 weeks. The median survival was 9.2 mos and 3.4 mos for patients with and without marrow CR (p<0.001). The multivariate analysis selected the achievement of response as independently associated with survival improvement [HR=0.5 (95% CI=0.28-0.89); p=0.02]. Disease with complex karyotype, translocation (4;11), translocation (9;22), and abnormal chromosome 17 [HR=2.9 (95% CI=1.29-6.62); p=0.009], and disease status beyond first Salvage regimen [HR=1.2 (95% CI=2.16-3.91); p=0.01] were independently associated with significant worse survival. Pts with 0, 1- 2 or 3 adverse factors had a median survival of 42+, 8, and 3 mos, respectively ( Figure 1 C). Conclusion: Our current analyses identified a subset of adult pts with ALL in whom outcome of therapy with IO can be differentially predicted. Table 1. Patients' characteristics . . N (%) .
