    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2958 PURPOSE: Recent advances in understanding of the molecular alterations that occur at the genetic and epigenetic levels in Multiple Myeloma (MM) have led to major leaps in identifying molecular pathways that regulate progression and resistance to therapeutic agents. However, despite great scientific advances at the genomic level, studies to identify signaling pathways deregulated at the functional proteomic level in MM are limited. Using an antibody-based protein microarray technique, we identified Citron Rho Interacting Kinase (CRIK) as a protein that was highly expressed in primary multiple myeloma (MM) cells compared to normal plasma cell. We therefore sought to investigate the functional role of CRIK in MM cells. Methods: Primary CD138+ sorted MM cells were obtained from the bone marrow of patients after informed consent. We determined the protein expression level of 512 polypeptides in 12 samples of newly diagnosed patients with MM and 4 healthy control using high-throughput proteomic analysis with antibody-based protein microarray (Clontech, CA). MM.1S, OPM2, RPMI8226, and INA6 were used to perform functional validation. Protein expression has been studied by immunoblotting. Gene expression analysis has been assessed using the Affymetrix U133A platform and qPCR. Lentivirus was used to knockdown CRIK in MM cell lines (MM.1S, RPMI8226, OPM2, and INA6). DNA synthesis, cell survival, cell cycle profiling and apoptosis were assessed by BrdU, MTT, PI and Apo2.7 staining, and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Results: We first showed that CRIK was overexpressed in 12 patients with MM compared to normal CD138+ cells obtained from healthy controls using high-throughput protein microarray. We further confirmed CRIK expression using immunohistochemistry in the same samples of MM patients. We next correlated CRIK gene expression level (CIT) with prognosis using previously published gene expression datasets and found that CRIK correlated with poor prognosis. Knockdown of CRIK in MM cell lines led to an anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect in all MM cell lines tested. Indeed, CRIK-knockdown MM cells were characterized by a reduction of 60\u201380% in the proliferation rate, supported by reduction of DNA synthesis and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Moreover, induction of cytotoxicity of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, and parp cleavage was also demonstrated in CRIK knockdown cells compared to scramble probe transfected cells. We also showed that CRIK knockdown led to cytokinesis in MM cell lines, indicating a possible mechanism of inhibition of proliferation of these cells. Conclusion: In this study, we show that MM cells express a high level of a novel protein CRIK, and that inhibition of this protein leads to significant inhibition of proliferation and survival of MM cells. CRIK could be a critical therapeutic target in MM.
