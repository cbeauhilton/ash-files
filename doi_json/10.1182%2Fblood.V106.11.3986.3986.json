    "abstract_text": "Because treatment response in ITP is variable, it would be useful to be able to assess which patients are likely to respond to conventional treatment. Toward this goal we correlated the number of platelet surface IgG molecules measured with a quantitative radiometric platelet antibody assay (PAIgG) with treatment related changes in platelet count. We tested the hypothesis that patients\u2019 response to conventional treatment could be stratified based on quantitation of the patients\u2019 PAIgG. Data was obtained via a retrospective chart review. Patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), age 18 or older with an initial platelet count of 1,000 m/plt 16 had platelet counts of 1000 m/plt exhibited a significantly greater increase in platelet count \u03bc=73,000 \u00b192,000 as compared to those with PAIgG levels \u22641000 m/plt, \u03bc=18,000 \u00b143,000 (p=0.03). Although a PAIgG level of 500 m/plt is 3 standard deviations above the mean of normals, a greater response to treatment was noted in patients if their PAIgG level was >1000 m/plt. Patients with PAIgG levels between 500 and 1000 m/plt respond in a similar fashion to those with PAIgG levels 1000 m/plt received conventional treatment (19/33 vs. 10/31; p1,000 m/plt platelet counts that are less than 50,000. Those patients whose PAIgG is >1,000 m/plt are more likely to receive treatment and have an increase in platelet count with conventional therapy. We conclude that radiometric quantitation of PAIgG is helpful for predicting a patient\u2019s response to therapy.",
