    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4735 Purpose: Monosomal karyotype (MK) refers to the presence of two or more distinct autosomal monosomies or a single monosomy associated with a structural abnormality. To analyze the prognosis of cytogenetic components of a complex karyotype or Monosomal Karyotype in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) except acute promyelocytic leukemia(APL). Patients and Methods :Cytogenetics and overall survival (OS), Disease free survival(DFS) were analyzed in 551 AML patients age 14 to 60 years in our center. Results: There ware 235 patiets with cytogenetic abnormalities, 25 cases with inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22),and 63 cases with t(8;21); 31 cases (13.2%)met the criteria for MK and 39 cases (16.6%) had a complex karyotype without monosomies. OS was significantly inferior in patients with MK compared with those with a complex karyotype without monosomies ( P <0.01;HR 1.85,95% confidence interval(95%CI),0.95-2.81). There was no difference between MK cases with complex karyotype cases in DFS ( P >0.05\u25a1GHR 3.42,95% confidence interval(95%CI),2.96-6.70). There was significant difference in regardless of whether OS or DFS between MK + patients with MK \u2212 patients ( P <0.01). Conclusion: MK was one of independent risk factor in AML patients.
