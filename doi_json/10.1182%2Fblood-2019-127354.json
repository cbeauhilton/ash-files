    "abstract_text": "The mechanism underlying quiescence and/or mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells and their bone marrow progenitors (HSPC) into circulation are tightly regulated for the continuous supply of peripheral blood cells; however, non-physiological or stress conditions, such as infections, can accelerate these mechanisms. Our results have shown that polyphenols modulate quiescence/mobilization of HSPC, but do not affect mature populations. Thrombin has been reported to induce the rapid HSPC mobilization through coagulation thrombin/PAR-1 axis, and quiescence is maintained across the APC/EPCR/PAR-1 axis ( Nat. Med. 2015, 21:1307-17). Our objective was to investigate the effect of polyphenols on thrombin/PAR-1 and APC/EPCR/PAR-1 axis. C57BL/6J mice (6-8 weeks old) were treated with polyphenols from green tea extract (250 mg/kg body weight) orally (gavage) once every seven days and injected (i.p.) at day 7 with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100\u03bcg;Sigma) (n=6). The control group received vehicle and was injected with LPS (n=6). After 24h of LPS injection, mice were anesthetized for blood collection, and then sacrificed for bone marrow collection. PAR-1 and EPCR expression, nitric oxide (NO) production and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation were evaluated in HSPC by flow cytometry. The functional ability of HSC was assessed by competitive repopulation assay. Vascular permeability was studied using Evans blue. After LPS injection, mice showed reduced expression of EPCR in bone marrow LSK parallel to an increase of PAR-1 expression in circulating immature and mature cells. Treatment of these mice with polyphenols partially prevented the reduced expression of EPCR in bone marrow LSK (13\u00b13 vs 54\u00b112; p<0.05), but did not affect the increased PAR-1 expression in circulating immature and mature cells. Evans blue assay revealed a reduction in the vascular permeability of the bone marrow of LPS-injected mice treated with polyphenols (3.9\u00b10.5 vs 2.1\u00b10.1; p<0.05). To assess whether polyphenols altered NO production, we measured NO levels and eNOS phosphorylation in immature LSK EPCR high (or LT-HSC) cells. NO production is activated by eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 and negatively regulated by eNOS phosphorylation at Thr495. LPS injection rapidly increased NO levels and eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 in bone marrow LSK of mice. Treatment of these mice with polyphenols reduced the percentage of bone marrow LSK EPCR high cells with higher intracellular NO (52\u00b12.8 vs 28\u00b15.6; p<0.01) and increased eNOS phosphorylation at Thr495 in immature LSK. In order to evaluate the action of polyphenols on the functional ability of HSC, a competitive bone marrow repopulation assay was performed. Donor mice (C57BL/6J) received or not polyphenols followed by LPS injection (treated group: Polyphenols+LPS ; control group: LPS ), and bone marrow cells were transplanted (1:1) together with bone marrow cells of competitors (B6.SJL-Ptprc a Pepc b /BoyJ) in lethally irradiated recipients (B6.SJL-Ptprc a Pepc b /BoyJ). Mice were followed for 16 weeks and hematological analysis revealed no difference in circulating leukocytes, platelets or hemoglobin levels. Transplanted mice (recipients) presented a higher percentage of CD45+ cells from Polyphenols+LPS donors (33.7\u00b113 vs 78.6\u00b10.9; p<0.05) in the peripheral blood, as well as increased number of T lymphocytes (6.7\u00b14.5 vs 37.2\u00b12.9; p<0.05) and myeloid cells (68.5\u00b11.7 vs 82.5\u00b13.5; p<0.05) from Polyphenols+LPS group. After 16 weeks, mice were euthanized and a higher percentage of LSK (or HSC) and LSK EPCR high (or LT-HSC) cells from Polyphenols+LPS donors were detected in the bone marrow, although only the percentage of LSK EPCR high was statistically different (0.0014\u00b10.0001 vs 0.0032\u00b10.001; p<0.05). Taken together, our results indicate that polyphenols increased the functional ability of HSC in LPS-injected mice showing increased percentage of bone marrow LSK EPCR high cells, which are the most quiescent stem cells with strong self-renewal ability. Polyphenols reduced EPCR expression and NO production in immature cells of LPS-injected mice, exhibiting an anti-inflammatory effect that leads to the maintenance of barrier integrity and quiescence of cells, which was corroborated by reducing vascular permeability in the bone marrow. Thus, polyphenols appear to modulate quiescence/mobilization of HSPC through APC/EPCR/PAR-1 axis. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
