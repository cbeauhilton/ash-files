    "abstract_text": "Introduction Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignant plasma cell disease with the highest incidence occurring at 65-70 years of age while 10% of patients are diagnosed below 55 years of age. The International Myeloma Working Group recently proposed new risk stratification standards for MM patients: high-risk (HR), standard (SR) and low-risk (LR) groups (Leukemia 2014, 28, 269\u221277). Although a median overall survival of LR patients is > 10 years from the diagnosis, new drugs and therapeutic innovations are urgently needed for HR patients (20%) who have a median overall survival of only two years. To identify new treatment options for MM patients, we compared ex vivo drug sensitivity data from primary CD138+ cells to standard risk stratification markers. Ex vivo responses indicated a number of investigational drugs as potential novel options for HR MM patients with links to risk markers. Methods Bone marrow aspirates were collected from newly diagnosed (n=14) and relapsed/refractory (n=21) MM patients. Cytogenetics were determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and the patients stratified based on the presence or absence of adverse FISH markers (t(4;14) and 17p del). Plasma cells (CD138+) were enriched from freshly isolated bone marrow samples and exome sequencing performed using DNA extracted from the CD138+ cells and matched skin biopsies. Ex vivo drug sensitivity was assessed by measuring the viability of the cells after 3-day incubation with 306 different oncology drugs in a 10,000-fold concentration range. Drug sensitivity scores were calculated based on the normalized area under the dose response curve (Scientific Reports 2014, 4, 5193) and select sensitivities determined by comparing results to healthy bone marrow cells. Based on drug sensitivities, the patients were classified in four different groups (sensitive, moderately sensitive, resistant and highly resistant). Results Of the 35 patients included in this study, 11 were classified as HR (31%) and 24 as SR/LR (69%). In the HR group 6/11 (55%) had t(4;14) and 5/11 patients (45%) had 17p13 del. In the SR/LR group common abnormalities included 13 monosomy/13q del (10/24), 1q gain (10/24) and K/NRAS mutation (11/24). Within the HR group, other co-occurring abnormalities included 1q gain (9/11), 13 monosomy/13q del (6/11), K/NRAS mutation (5/11), and TP53 mutation (2/11). Based on overall ex vivo drug sensitivity profiles of all patients, the majority of HR patients were classified as moderately sensitive (8/11; 73%) while SR/LR patients had diverse responses from sensitive to highly resistant. In the HR group, the highest select sensitivities were to BH3 mimetics and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. While the t(4;14) is predicted to lead to upregulation and increased activity of the FGFR3, which could be targeted by FGFR inhibitors, none of the t(4;14) samples showed sensitivity to these drugs. However, with the exception of one t(4;14) sample, the rest all showed good sensitivity to dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, but not to rapalogs, suggesting that inhibition of PI3K and the mTORC1/2 complexes is required to inhibit t(4;14) cell growth rather than mTORC1 alone. Of the 17p del patients, 3/5 were classified as moderately sensitive, 1/5 sensitive and 1/5 highly resistant based on ex vivo drug response of CD138+ cells. All showed select sensitivity to BH3 mimetics/BCL2 inhibitors (navitoclax/ABT-263 and venetoclax/ABT-199/GDC-0199), while response to other drugs varied. Therefore, blocking cell survival signaling is likely essential for this group of HR MM patients. Conclusion By assessing the ex vivo sensitivity of primary plasma cells to a large collection of oncology drugs and comparing these data to standard risk stratification markers for MM, we have been able to identify potential new treatment options for high risk MM patients including dual PI3K/mTOR and BCL2- inhibitors. Although a larger cohort of patients is required to support the correlation between specific drug sensitivities and risk markers, these preliminary data indicate that currently used risk markers may be useful to predict the use of novel treatments.
