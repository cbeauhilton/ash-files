    "abstract_text": "Background: Inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO) and blinatumomab both improve survival in relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) compared to conventional chemotherapy. The combination of INO with reduced-intensity mini-hyper-CVD chemotherapy in older adults with newly diagnosed ALL is safe and highly effective (Kantarjian H et al, Lancet Oncol 2018;19(2):240-8). The addition of blinatumomab to this regimen may further improve outcomes. Methods: Patients (pts) \u226560 years of age with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative pre-B-cell ALL were eligible. Pts were required to have a performance status of \u22643, total bilirubin \u22641.5 mg/dl, AST/ALT \u22643x ULN and creatinine \u22642 mg/dl. Pts received mini-hyper-CVD (cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone at 50% dose reduction, no anthracycline, methotrexate at 75% dose reduction, cytarabine at 0.5 g/m2 x 4 doses) for up to 8 cycles. INO was given at a dose of 1.3-1.8mg/m2 on day 3 of cycle 1 and 0.8-1.3mg/m2 on day 3 of cycles 2-4. Rituximab (if CD20+) and prophylactic IT chemotherapy were given for the first 4 cycles. Responding pts received POMP maintenance for up to 3 years. In order to decrease the risk of veno-occlusive disease (VOD), the protocol was amended in 3/2017 (pts 50+) to give INO in fractionated doses each cycle (0.6 mg/m2 on day 2 and 0.3 mg/m2 on day 8 of cycle 1; 0.3 mg/m2 on day 2 and 8 of cycles 2-4) and to administer 4 cycles of blinatumomab following 4 cycles of hyper-CVD plus INO, followed by maintenance with 12 cycles of POMP and 4 cycles of blinatumomab (1 cycle of blinatumomab after every 3 cycles of POMP). Results: 64 pts have been treated, 5 of whom were in complete remission (CR) at enrollment. Pt characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . Median age was 68 years (range, 60-81 years); 27 pts (42%) were \u226570 years. 28% were positive for TP53 mutation, 19% were CRLF2 positive, and 27% had adverse-risk karyotype. 33/58 pts (57%) were CD20+ and received rituximab. Among 59 pts evaluable for morphologic response, 58 (98%) responded (CR, n=51; CRp, n=6; CRi, n=1). MRD negativity by 6-color flow cytometry was achieved in 48/62 pts (77%) after 1 cycle and 59/63 pts (94%) overall. There were no early deaths, and the 30-day and 60-day mortality rates were 0% and 3%, respectively. Among 63 pts who achieved remission, 9 (14%) relapsed, 3 (5%) underwent allogeneic SCT in first remission, 30 (48%) remain on treatment or have completed maintenance, and 21 (33%) died in CR/CRp. The rate of death in CR/CRp was higher in pts \u226570 years of age vs. 60-69 years (50% vs. 22%; P=0.02). Causes of death for pts in CR/CRp included: sepsis (n=7; all in pts 70 years and older), VOD (n=3), gunshot wound (n=1), dementia and deconditioning (n=1), end stage renal disease (n=1), MDS/AML (n=4; 3 in pts 70 years and older) and unknown causes (n=4). 6 pts (9%) developed VOD, 1 after subsequent allogeneic SCT. The rate of VOD was 6/64 (9%) with no difference in VOD in pts who did or did not receive blinatumomab. With a median follow-up of 37 months (range, 2-85 months), 34 pts (53%) were alive, 30 of whom (47%) were in CR and MRD negative status. The 3-year continuous remission and OS rates were 76% and 54%, respectively ( Figure 1A ). The 3-year continuous remission rate was 69% and 87% for pts age 60-69 and \u226570 years, respectively (P=0.25), and the 3-year OS rate was 63% and 42%, respectively (P=0.13; Figure 1B ). The trend for worse survival in the pts \u226570 years was driven predominantly by the increased rate of death in CR/CRp in this older group. The outcomes of pts who did or did not receive blinatumomab were similar . Compared to a similar historical cohort of older pts treated with hyper-CVAD \u00b1 rituximab (n=77), mini-hyper-CVD + INO \u00b1 blinatumomab resulted in significantly higher 3-year OS (54% vs 32%; P=0.007). Conclusion: Reduced-intensity chemotherapy with hyper-CVD plus INO, with or without blinatumomab, is safe and effective in older adults with newly diagnosed Ph-negative ALL, with an overall response rate of 98% and 3-year OS rate of 54%. Further optimization of this regimen with less chemotherapy in patients 70 years and older is warranted to further decrease the rate of death in remission.
