    "abstract_text": "In patients undergoing ASCT, RBC transfusions are depending on donor availability and correlated with early and late side effects such as immune reactions and infections. Three weeks long acting Darbepoietin is currently available, but its role in ASCT in terms of efficacy, safety and cost has not yet been established. Aim: This pilot study was activated in ASCT patients to test the impact of Darbepoietin on the haemoglobin level; RBC transfusion requirement; the total cost of Darbepoietin therapy during the first 30 days after ASCT. Material and methods. From September 2006 to June 2007, 10 patients - 5 males, median age 57 years (range 20\u201371) - with Multiple Myeloma (MM n=7) in 1 st response, Non-Hodgkin (NHL n=2) and Hodgkin (HL n=1) Lymphoma in 2 nd complete remission entered the study. As conditioning regimens, the patients received Mel 200 (n=8) or BEAM (n=2). Baseline Hb and Epo median values were: 12,1g/L (range 10.3 \u2013 16.2 g/L), and 28.7mU/mL (range, 4.1\u2013220 mU/L), respectively. The median value of CD34+ cells infused was 4.99 x109/L (range 3.04 \u2013 5.07) and the median time to engraftment was 10 days (range 8\u201311). To prevent anaemia, patients were given i.c. single dose 500 U Darbepoietin on day +1, associated with iron therapy and B12 vitamin /weekly, plus folinic acid and B6 vitamin/daily. RBC transfusion was mandatory for Hb level \u2264 8g/L. Results: At day +30, in 9/10 patients (7 MM, 1 NHL and 1HL) the median Hb value was 13.2 g/L (range 10.2 \u2013 15.1g/L), and none of them were transfused. Only 1 NHL received 1 RBC unit on day +7 because of Hb was 8g/L; in this case, the baseline dosage of Epo was high (220 mU/L). On the follow-up (median time 4 months, range 1\u201311), no thromboembolic events or other side effects occurred. Finally, in our Country the price of 1 vial Darbepoietin and 1 RBC transfusion (packed, filtered and irradiated) is 744.60 and 340 euro, respectively. Therefore,, the cost of the entire supportive therapy in our 10 patients has been 7.786 euro. Comments Despite the small number of patients, from this pilot study we can drawn the conclusion that Darbepoietin seems an effective and safe therapy and could represent an appropriate support in ASCT patients with baseline low/normal Epo level. Only a prospective, randomized study on a large number of patients will be able to answer the question on the Darbepoietin cost-efficacy in ASCT.",
