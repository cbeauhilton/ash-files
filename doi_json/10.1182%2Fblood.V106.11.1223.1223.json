    "abstract_text": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is characterized by specific cytogenetic aberrations which are strong determinants of prognostic outcome and therapeutic response. Because the clinical outcome in AML cytogenetic groups differs considerably, we hypothesized that cytogenetic risk groups of AML might differ specifically in their proteome, protein interaction pathways and posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Thus, we determined the proteome of 30 AML patients belonging to various cytogenetic groups based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Nano LC coupled MALDI-TOF-TOF tandem mass spectrometry. We could identify substantial differences in the proteome, protein expression and peak pattern between cytogenetic risk groups of AML. The interactome analysis based on computational bioinformatics using Ingenuity analysis revealed major regulating networks: MAPK8 and MYC for complex aberrant karyotype AML, TP53 for t(8;21)-AML, TP53- MYC- PRKAC for 11q23-AML, JUN and MYC for inv(16)-AML. Most interestingly, peak explorer analysis revealed a modification of O-linked acetyl glucosamine of hnRNPH1 in AML patients with a 11q23 translocation, an acetylation of calreticulin in t(8;21) translocation AML, an increased intensity of dimethylated peptide of hnRNPA2/B1 in AML patients with translocations of t(8;21) and inv(16) in comparison to healthy bone marrow. We show for the first time that cytogenetic risk groups of AML differ specifically both in their proteome, interactome and PTMs. These findings lead to a new thinking about the pathogenesis of AML and has major therapeutic implications because PTMs are the primary drug targets.",
