    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2922 The development of new and biologically-based therapeutic regimens is critical for the successful control, if not cure, of multiple myeloma. Incorporation of the novel agents, including the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, harbored large strides in disease modification. However, even with the success of bortezomib containing regimens, drug resistance and disease relapse remain inevitable. As such, it is critical that we use preclinical models to not only develop drugs, but also to consider strategies for co-development of novel drug combinations capitalizing on complementary biological activities. Our investigations in drug resistance recently revealed that increased homologous recombination (HR) potential, via over-expression of the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway (FA/BRCA pathway), contributed to acquired melphalan-resistance in myeloma cell lines.(Yarde et al 2009) Drug resistance was causally linked to a novel transcriptional regulation of the FA/BRCA by NF-\u03baB. Further examination demonstrated that bortezomib attenuated this component of the HR repair pathway and reversed melphalan resistance. To this end, we anticipated that bortezomib treatment may sensitize cells to inhibitors of complementary DNA repair pathways in a manner similar to the synthetic lethality elicited in by PARP1/2 inhibition in BRCA1 or FANCD1/ BRCA2 mutant cancers.(Farmer 2005, Bryant 2005) Consistent with this rationale, treatment of myeloma cells with bortezomib and the PARP inhibitor AZD2281/olaparib demonstrated synergism in specific myeloma cell lines. Pre-treatment of RPMI8226 myeloma cells with bortezomib for 6 hours greatly enhanced myeloma cell sensitivity to PARP inhibition with AZD2281/olaparib. The inhibitory concentration(IC)-50 was decreased by 17.7-fold (n=3; IC50 AZD2281 alone: 62.7 microM (39.0\u201384.0) and pretreated with bortezomib 3.54 microM (2.4\u20134.6)). Combination Index (CI) demonstrated a mean of 0.41 in 8226 and 0.43 in U266 myeloma cells, consistent with a synergistic relationship. Further analysis confirmed that synergism correlated with decreased expression of FANCD2 mRNA and protein by 6 hours. In contrast to sequential treatment, concomitant treatment with these agents did not elicit the synergistic phenotype. Interestingly, sequential treatment of NCIH929 myeloma cells did not demonstrate the same synergistic response (CI :0.89, slight synergism). Consistent with this, treatment of NCIH929 cells with bortezomib did not negatively regulate FANCD2 mRNA or protein expression, suggesting that FA/BRCA pathway can be differentially regulated in myeloma cells. To more specifically determine if FANCD2 was a key factor regulated by bortezomib, we targeted FANCD2 with siRNA. Pretreatment of myeloma cells with FANCD2 siRNA also sensitized cells to AZD2281/olaparib relative to siRNA control (IC50: 19.0 microM vs 35.0 microM n=4; p<0.05). These results show that bortezomib (or other proteosome inhibitors) and AZD2281/olaparib (or other PARP inhibitors) may represent an exciting new combination therapy for myeloma. We are currently examining the applicability of these studies to other proteosome inhibitors and the clinical relevance with ex vivo studies with myeloma patient samples. We believe that data presented here are innovative as they introduce a novel biological rationale, the abrogation complementary pathways in DNA damage repair, for the preclinical development of novel targeted drug combinations in myeloma. Further, we anticipate that although this study has focused on multiple myeloma, the results of the proposed research will be applicable to a wide range of hematologic and solid tumors.
