The chronic nature of MDS, the risk of progressive evolution, advanced age, anemia and the rapid changes in physical status make the MDS patient unique within the cancer population. Quality of Life (QoL) in MDS is undoubtedly compromised by functional, psychological, and disease-specific components. Treatment options are still scarce in this elderly population and hematologists must select candidates for experimental therapy. Patients\u2019 preferences are requisites for therapeutic choice so that it is essential that clinicians understand patients\u2019 perceptions. STUDY DESIGN: We designed a multicenter Italian 18-month prospective observational study in 150 MDS patients from diagnosis to evaluate the correlation between QoL changes and changes in Hb and other MDS-related variables. Comparison between the patients\u2019 and the physicians\u2019 perception of QoL, QoL changes related to adaptation, progression and treatment response, and feasibility, consistency and validity of the QoL instruments were evaluated. Selection criteria included adult age, MDS at diagnosis with IPSS score < 2, at least 1 cytopenia, ability to complete the QoL questionnaires and ECOG PS < 3. METHODS: The QoL instruments (QOL-E v.2, LASA scale, and EQ-5D) were completed by patients and physicians (both blind to each other\u2019s responses) at baseline, months 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18. Clinical and laboratory data were collected throughout the study. RESULTS: Median age was 74 (IQ range 67\u201379); 85 were males (57%). Patients were classified according to WHO: 48 RA (32%), 30 RCMD (20%), 21 RAEB-1 (14%), 7 RAEB-2 (5%), 6 5q-syndrome (4%), 4 RARS (3%), 3 CMML (2%), 1 RCMD/RS (1%), 30 MDS-U (20%). Fifty-six patients (37%) had IPSS low risk, 62 (41%) Int-1 and 14 (9%) Int-2. In 18 (12%) patients IPSS was not evaluable due to karyotype. Thirty-nine patients (26%) were transfusion-dependent (TD) and 28 (72%) had at least 1 additional cytopenia. In the transfusion-free (TF) patients, median Hb was 10.5 g/dL (IQ range 9.2\u201312.6); 77 patients (69%) were anemic (Hb < 12.0 g/dL) and 48 (43%) had at least 1 additional cytopenia. ECOG PS was significantly better in TF patients (p=0.0061). Charlson\u2019s comorbidity index was 0 in 78 patients (52%), 1 in 38 patients (25%), 2 in 20 patients (13%) and \u2265 3 in 14 patients (9%). Median serum epo was 50.4 U/L (N=94). Of the 29 QOL-E items, 25 items had a response rate > 90%. Though 26 of the 29 QOL-E items showed significant correlations between patients\u2019 and physicians\u2019 scores, there were significant score differences in 9 (31%) of the items with a general trend of physicians to overestimate patients\u2019 problems. Several QoL scores correlated with Hb levels and were significantly lower in TD patients than in TF patients (Table). Table.

CONCLUSIONS: QoL is compromised in MDS and is associated with Hb values and transfusion-dependence. Patient preferences must be evaluated when considering treatment options since hematologists seem to overestimate patients\u2019 perception of healthrelated problems. The disease-specific questionnaire, QOL-E, and the LASA scale are valid tools for the evaluation of QoL in MDS patients.",
