    "abstract_text": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical course where some patients have an indolent disease and survive for decades while others have a rapidly progressive disease with short survival. Clinical staging according to Rai or Binet are useful in predicting survival. However, in early stages a subset of patients progress while others remain stable. CLL can be subdivided into two groups based on IgV H gene mutation status, and it has been shown that patients with unmutated IgV H genes have poorer survival irrespective of clinical stage. A major drawback using mutation status as a prognostic marker is that it is expensive and time consuming. Therefore, there is a need for surrogate markers that can be analyzed in routine laboratories. We analyzed the expression of CD69, CD38 and ZAP-70 in CD19 + cells from CLL patients (n=28) and healthy donors (n=10) using flow cytometry. The gene expression of ZAP-70 was also analyzed by real-time PCR. CD69 was higher expressed in B cells from CLL patients compared with controls (35\u00b131% and 2.6\u00b11.8% CD69 + /CD19 + cells respectively, P =0.001). Patients with unmutated IgV H genes (UM CLL) had a higher percentage of CD69 + cells compared with patients with mutatated IgV H (M CLL; 70\u00b124% vs. 18\u00b112%, P =0.00076). Furthermore, there was a strong concordance, even better than CD38 and ZAP-70, between IgV H mutation status and expression of CD69 (96%). Thus, we suggest that CD69 expression can be used as a surrogate marker for mutation status. Furthermore, this analysis is reliable and inexpensive. Figure 1.

B) CD19 + B cells from 10 controls and 28 patients were analyzed for CD69 expression. % CD69 + /CD19 + cells in controls vs. all CLL patients, Binet A vs. Binet B+C and mutated vs. unmutated CLL patient. Horizontal lines represent mean values in each group. C) Concordance between IgV H mutation status and CD69, CD38 and ZAP-70. Individuals with \u2265 20% positive CD19 + cells were defined as positive for CD38 and ZAP-70. For CD69, individuals with \u2265 50% positive CD19 + cells were defined as \u201chigh CD69\u201d and individuals with <50% CD69 were defined as \u201clow CD69\u201d. Percentage deviation from the most similar germline gene is shown. Genes with \u2265 2% deviation (dotted line) were defined as mutated. D) ZAP-70 mRNA expression was analyzed in 22 patients by RT-PCR. Mean ZAP-70/RPLP0 expression\u00b1SD in CLL patients with mutated IgV H genes (n=16) vs. unmutated IgV H genes (n=6) are shown.
