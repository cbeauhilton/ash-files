    "abstract_text": "Cas-L (Crk-associated substrate lymphocyte type) which is also known as Hef1 (human enhancer of filamentation 1) was first identified as a protein tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation of b1 integrin. Cas-L possesses a single Src homology (SH) 3 domain and multiple YXXP motifs (substrate domain) as a member of Cas protein family, and is well expressed in peripheral lymphocytes. Previous studies suggest that Cas-L might be involved in Bcr-Abl positive leukemia and adult T cell leukemia. However, the biological function of Cas-L in lymphocytes is little known. We generated Cas-L-deficient mice using a gene targeting strategy. The mice showed a deficit of marginal zone (MZ) B cells and a decrease of cell number in secondary lymphoid organs. To elucidate the mechanism of the MZ B cell defect, the reciprocal bone marrow transfer assays were performed. The results revealed that the defect of MZ B cells in Cas-L-deficient mice is cell autonomous. Next, we analyzed B cell receptor signaling by measurement of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and lymphocyte proliferation. However, we could not find any significant differences between wild type and Cas-L-deficient mice. Cas-L-deficient lymphocytes showed reduced chemotactic response to CXCL12 and CXCL13. The adhesion assay also showed the decreased adhesiveness to VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, which are important for retention of MZ B cells in spleen. Moreover, we found that the lymphocyte trafficking to spleen and lymph nodes was altered in Cas-L-deficient mice. Thus, Cas-L affects homeostasis of MZ B cells and peripheral lymphoid organs, which is considered to be relevant to impaired lymphocyte migration and adhesion.",
