    "abstract_text": "Mutations in 11 genes have been described in patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DC) and related telomere diseases, and account for ~60% of cases. Amongst these, loss-of-function mutations in the poly(A)-specific ribonuclease ( PARN ) have most recently been found in patients with DC and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. PARN has no known role in telomere biology. Why PARN deficiency should mimic telomere diseases remains unclear. Based on its 7-methylguanylate (m 7 G) cap recognition and poly(A) deadenylase functions, PARN's primary role is considered to be in regulating mRNA metabolism. Recent studies implicate PARN in non-coding RNA biogenesis, including maturation of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) via the deadenylation of oligo-adenylated (oligo(A)) intermediates. In two DC patients with biallelic defects in the PARN gene, we found decreased levels of the telomerase RNA component ( TERC ). TERC is the essential non-coding RNA template and scaffold of the telomerase holoenzyme. TERC possesses an m 7 G cap but unlike mRNAs does not have a long poly(A) tail; rather, TERC contains a box H/ACA motif as is found in some snoRNAs. We hypothesized that TERC is regulated by PARN in a manner similar to snoRNAs, given their shared 3\u2032 box H/ACA architecture. Here, usingsomatic cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from DC patients with PARN mutations, we show that PARN is required for the 3\u2032 end maturation and accumulation of TERC RNA. In PARN- mutant iPS cells and PARN-deficient cell lines, we find impaired telomerase activity and telomere maintenance. Deep sequencing of TERC 3' ends reveals that PARN is required for the removal of genomically-encoded extensions and post-transcriptionally acquired oligo(A) tails that target nuclear RNAs for destruction. In keeping with this, TERC transcripts from PARN -mutant patient cells decay at an accelerated rate. The diminished TERC steady-state levels, increased oligo(A) forms of TERC , and defects in telomere maintenance in patient cells are rescued by ectopic expression of PARN. Global transcript analysis by RNA-Seq in patient cells and PARN-deficient cell lines compared to controls reveals no protein coding mRNAs that consistently manifest a fold-change exceeding the change in TERC levels. Our data indicate that PARN functions in TERC biogenesis via deadenylation of oligo-adenylated nascent transcripts, which promotes 3' end maturation and stability. Given these findings and the phenotype of patients with PARN mutations, we speculate that a major, non-redundant function of PARN in human cells is regulating the maturation of TERC and other non-coding RNAs, more so than mRNA metabolism. Our results reveal a novel role for PARN in the biogenesis of TERC , and provide a mechanism linking PARN mutations to defective telomere maintenance in DC and related diseases.
