    "abstract_text": "Prompted by the activity of lenalidomide (Revlimid\u00ae) in pts with chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF), we sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of lenalidomide and prednisone in a phase II study for pts with CIMF. The rationale for this combination is that the anti-angiogenic and anti-TNFa effects of lenalidomide may be potentiated by the effects of prednisone to reduce marrow fibrosis and improve hematopoiesis in CIMF. Initial therapy consisted of lenalidomide 10 mg/d (dose level [DL] 0) on days 1\u201321 of a 28\u2013day cycle for 6 cycles, in combination with prednisone 30 mg/d orally during cycle 1, 15 mg/d orally during cycle 2, and 15 mg/d every other day during cycle 3. The lenalidomide dose could be reduced to 5 mg/d (DL -1) or to 5 mg/d every other day (DL -2), or increased to 15 mg/d (DL +1) or 20 mg/d (DL +2) depending upon toxicity or lack of response, respectively. A total of 40 pts (23 male, 17 female) have been enrolled. The median age was 62 years (range, 41\u201386), time from CIMF diagnosis to the study treatment 10 months (range, 0\u2013269), WBC count 87x10 9 /L (range, 1.1\u201389), hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL (range, 7.8\u201317.3), platelets 137x10 9 /L (range, 8\u20131183). Pts had received a median of 1 prior therapy (range 0\u20134): hydroxyurea (HU; n=14), anagrelide (AG; n=4), azacitidine (n=6), steroids (n=5), thalidomide (n=4), and interferon (n=3). Ten (25%) pts had not received any prior therapy. JAK2 V617F mutation was detected in 18 (50%) of 36 tested pts and 20 (50%) of 40 had abnormal cytogenetics. A total of 260 cycles have been administered. All 40 pts are evaluable for response and toxicity. Responses have been observed in 12 (30%) pts, including complete response (CR) in 2 (normal blood counts and <5% bone marrow blasts, off HU, AG, growth factors, and no transfusions); partial response (PR) in 7 (at least 2 of the following: Hb increase by \u22652 g/dL, 50% increase in platelets, decrease of bone marrow blasts or organomegaly by \u226550%, normalization of WBC count without blasts, or reduction in bone marrow fibrosis; off HU, AG, growth factors, and transfusion independence); and hematologic improvement (HI) in 3 (at least 2 of the following: decrease by \u226525% of pretreatment leukocytosis, splenomegaly, or marrow blasts, or increase of Hb by \u22651g/dl without growth factor or transfusion support or platelets by \u226525%; off HU, AG, growth factors). Median time to response was 12 weeks (range, 2\u201332). Responses have been sustained for a median of 15 wks (range, 5\u201336) and are ongoing in all 12 responders. Overall, 21 (53%) pts experienced grade 3\u20134 toxicity, being the most frequent neutropenia, anemia, musculoskeletal pain, and fatigue. Twenty-four (60%) pts have required dose reduction to DL -1, of which 5 (12.5%) further reduced to DL -2. One (2.5%) pt dose-escalated to DL +1, while 15 (25%) remained at DL 0. Twenty-one (53%) pts discontinued lenalidomide due to: lack of response (n=8), pt\u2019s decision (n=7), grade 3\u20134 toxicity (n=5), and poor compliance (n=1). No deaths or transformation to acute myeloid leukemia occurred. In summary, the combination of lenalidomide and prednisone is an active and generally well-tolerated regimen for pts with CIMF. Longer follow-up is warranted to evaluate the durability of ongoing responses. Updated results will be presented at the meeting.",
