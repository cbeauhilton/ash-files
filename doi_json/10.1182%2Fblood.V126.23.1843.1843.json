    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Despite major advances in MM therapy with the inclusion of novel agent combinations for induction prior to and after autotransplant-supported high-dose melphalan, the 15% of patients with GEP-defined HRMM continue to fare poorly with PFS and OS not exceeding 2 and 3 years, respectively. This poor outcome has not been improved with less dose-intense and more dose-dense Total Therapy 5. Having previously reported on 16-day metronomic therapy with low-dose doxorubicin (DOX) and cisplatin (DDP) plus VTD (Papanikolaou, Haematologica), we explored further extension of such metronomic treatment to 28 days (metro-28) also in newly diagnosed HRMM patients. Patients and Methods: All patients signed a written informed consent and data analysis was approved by our IRB. In the outpatient setting, a single cycle of metro-28 comprised DOX and DDP each at 1.0mg/m2/d for 28d by continuous infusion (CI), along with VTD (bortezomib 1.0mg/m2 on days 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22, 25-28; DEX 12mg on days 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22, 25-28; thalidomide 50-100mg/d x 28d; some patients also received vincristine [VCR] at a flat daily dose of 0.07mg/d x 28d by CI. Results: Fourteen patients were initiated on metro-28. Their characteristics included age >=65y in 12; albumin 5.5mg/L in 7; cytogenetic abnormalities [CA] were present in 10; GEP70 HRMM in 9/13; PR subgroup in 8/13 ( Table 1 ). The median follow up is 11mo. As portrayed in Figure 1A , no patient has died; the 6mo PFS estimate was 85% ( Figure 1B ); responses included CR in 3/14, VGPR in 7/14 and PR in 10/14 ( Figure 1C ); and the PR duration estimate at 6mo is 80% ( Figure 1D ). Of interest, GEP70 scores morphed to low risk in 3/13. Vascular density (CD34) decreased markedly in most patients evaluated. Toxicities were minor; myelosuppression was virtually absent; alopecia was not encountered. Subsequent salvage therapies included repeat metro-28, combination chemotherapy (PACMED) and autotransplants. Conclusion: We conclude that metro-28 is a promising and safe strategy for elderly patients with HRMM, and we hypothesize an anti-angiogenic mechanism of action in addition to direct anti-MM effects.
