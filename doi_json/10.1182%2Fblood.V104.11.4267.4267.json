    "abstract_text": "Acute leukemias are frequently associated with specific chromosomal translocations of the human MLL gene. In general, MLL translocations define a distinct disease entity that needs to be diagnosed with precision to facilitate rapid clinical decisions. Here we present data about a new PCR based method that uses patient genomic DNA to identify any MLL fusion. Fourty different MLL translocations were successfully analyzed. We will present three novel MLL translocation partner genes and a new MLL deletion. The benefits of this novel technique for diagnosis and MRD analyses will be discussed. Supported by grant 2001.061.1 from the Wilhelm Sander foundation.",
