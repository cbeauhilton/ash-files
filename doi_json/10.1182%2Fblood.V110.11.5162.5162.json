    "abstract_text": "Background: Association between osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and aminobisphosphonate treatment in patients (pts.) with multiple myeloma, breast cancer and prostate cancer has been increasingly reported in the literature. Risk factors for this complication include presence of infection, recent dental extraction and any oral surgical procedure with bone exposure. Patients and Methods: All patients with myeloma multiple or prostate cancer diagnosis treated at two institutions from Lima with either IV zoledronic acid or pamidronate from 2005\u20132007 were evaluated using outpatient records. Patients with ONJ were identified and their characteristics were compared to all patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. Results: One hundred eighty three patients were evaluated. One hundred three had metastatic prostate cancer, and eighty myeloma multiple. All patients with myeloma multiple received pamidronate and all patients with prostate cancer received zoledronic acid. Six patients developed ONJ (3.2%). Five pts. were male and one female; a median age of 62 (range 50\u201374) and 5 had metastatic prostate cancer and 1 myeloma multiple. Zoledronic acid and pamidronate were involved in 5 and 1 cases respectively. The median number of bisphosphonate infusions prior to the development of ONJ was 16 (range 12\u201320). No patient had dental extraction or oral surgical procedure before ONJ. Bone exposition occurred in four cases. Treatment was antibiotics in all cases and surgery in two. Conclusions: ONJ is a serious complication of bisphosphonate therapy and it affected a significant proportion of our Latino american patients.",
