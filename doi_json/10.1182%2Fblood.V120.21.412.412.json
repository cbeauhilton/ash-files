    "abstract_text": "Abstract 412 Background: A large proportion of patients are currently not eligible for genotype-adapted strategies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in particular those lacking specific genetic aberrations such as PML-RARA , CBFB-MYH11 , RUNX1-RUNX1T1 , NPM1 or activating FLT3 mutations. This subgroup of patients accounts for about one-third of all AML patients and mainly includes the large group of AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, AML with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities [inv(3) or t(3;3), t(9;11), t(v;11q23)] and cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) with wild-type NPM1 and FLT3 . Prognosis in this subgroup of patients is generally poor. Azacitidine has been shown to be active in AML with low blast counts frequently observed in AML with myelodysplasia-related changes and in CN-AML in the absence of specific gene mutations. Aims: To evaluate clinical efficacy of azacitidine in combination with intensive induction chemotherapy and in maintenance for two years as single agent in patients with AML who are not candidates for genotype-adapted treatment approaches. Methods: Patients with AML in the absence of specific genetic aberrations ( PML-RARA , CBFB-MYH11, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, NPM1 mutation, activating FLT3 mutations) who are fit for intensive chemotherapy were eligible. Patients were up-front randomized for induction therapy into one standard arm and three experimental arms; i) ICE (standard arm), idarubicin (12 mg/m 2 /day, iv, days 1,3,5), cytarabine (100 mg/m 2 /day, cont. infusion, days 1\u20137), etoposide (100 mg/m 2 /day, iv, days 1,2,3); ii) AZA-prior, azacitidine (100 mg/m 2 /day, sc, days 1\u20135), idarubicin (12 mg/m 2 /day, iv, days 6, 8, 10), etoposide 100 mg/m 2 /day, iv, days 6,7,8); iii) AZA-concurrent, azacitidine (100 mg/m 2 /day, sc, days 1\u20135), idarubicin (12 mg/m 2 /day, iv, days 1,3,5), etoposide 100 mg/m 2 /day, iv, days 1,2,3); iv) AZA-after, idarubicin (12 mg/m 2 /day, iv, days 1,3,5), etoposide 100 mg/m 2 /day, iv, days 1,2,3), azacitidine (100 mg/m 2 /day, sc, days 4\u20138). After two induction cycles for patients achieving complete remission (CR), consolidation therapy was prioritized; first priority) allogeneic hematopoietic blood stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from matched related as well as unrelated donors, second priority) 3 courses of high-dose cytarabine followed by two-year maintenance therapy with azacitidine as single agent (50 mg/m 2 /day, sc, days 1\u20135, every 4 weeks) in patients initially randomized to experimental treatment. The primary endpoint was achievement of CR. The statistical design of the study was based on the Simon's optimal two-stage design applied for each arm separately. The null hypothesis was CR-rate equal or below 0.40 whereas the alternative hypothesis was a CR rate of at least 0.55 with a power of 80% and a level of significance of 5%. Thus, in each arm at least 12 of 26 patients with response to induction therapy were necessary after the first to proceed to the second stage. Results: During the first stage of the study 104 patients were randomized; median age was 62.5 years (range 18\u201382), 46% were female. Data on cytogenetics showed intermediate risk karyotype in 67% (n=50) including CN-AML (n=31) and high-risk karyotype in 33% (n=25). The most frequent serious adverse events were grade 3/4 infection with an overall incidence of 25% and ranging from 20 to 34% in the different treatment arms. The number of responding patients in the treatment arms AZA-prior and AZA-concurrent after the first stage of the study were 11 of 26 (42%) and 10 of 26 (38%)Both arms, AZA-prior and were terminated accordingly. In contrast, the treatment arms ICE and AZA-after were carried forward to the second stage of patient recruitment since responding patients at that time were 14 of 26 (54%) in both arms. In total, 100 patients each have been enrolled in both treatment arms, ICE and AZA-after, with CR-rates of 59% and 52%, respectively (p=0.39). To date, 60 patients received an allogeneic HSCT (n=36 matched unrelated donors, n=23 matched related donors, n=1 haploidentical family donor). Maintenance treatment was started in 12 patients. Conclusion: Induction therapy with ICE or idarubicin, etoposide followed by azacitidine (AZA-after) appears equally effective in producing CR in patients with AML who are not candidates for genotype-adapted treatment approaches. An amendment perpetuating the treatment arms ICE and AZA-after within a phase-III concept is planned. Disclosures: Schlenk: Celgene: Research Funding.
