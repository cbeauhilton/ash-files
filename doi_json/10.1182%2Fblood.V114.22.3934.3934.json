The infection rates were very different even in virus endemic areas as Asia-Pacific countries including Japan. However, an association between virus infection and lymphoma should be evaluated and discussed with the background of virus prevalence in the community. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of HBV or HCV infection status in lymphoma patients in Tohoku distinct in Japan. Patients and Methods The study, designed by the Tohoku Hematology Forum Group, was conducted in 9 clinical centers in Tohoku Distinct in Japan. This study included 1331 newly diagnosed consecutive series of lymphoma patients admitted in Tohoku Hematology Forum Group Hospital (Japan) and 848 non-lymphoma control patients enrolled from January 2005 to October 2008. We evaluated the prevalence of HBV (as indicated by hepatitis B surface antigen) or HCV infection in both group patients and compared the clinic-pathological characteristics of HBV- or HCV-positive and its negative lymphoma cases. Results The carrier rate of HBsAg was higher in lymphoma patients (57 of 1331, 4.3%) than control group (1.7%, p <0.001) The higher prevalence was observed in both sexes and especially diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Compared with HBV negative lymphoma group, the positive group displayed more liver or spleen involvement (p=0.002). The rate of HCV infection was higher than those in control group In HCV-infected case, more liver involvement was indicated (p<0.004). No difference in HBV or HCV prevalence was found between B-cell and T/NK-cell lymphoma. Conclusions The present study, so far the largest trial of incidence of HBV or HCV infection in lymphoma patients, demonstrated that patients with lymphoma in Japan had higher prevalence of HBV and HCV infection. These appears to be a possible role for HBV or HCV in the induction of malignant transformation, resulting in the development of lymphoma. However, the precise role of HBV or HCV in the pathogenesis of lymphoma remains to be elucidated and warrants further research. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
