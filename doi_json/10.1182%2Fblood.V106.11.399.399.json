    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Veno-Occlusive Disease (VOD) is a significant regimen-related toxicity of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT), which when complicated by multi-system organ failure (MOF) has a case fatality rate >90%. We have treated 139 patients (pts) with VOD/MOF in a randomized, multicenter Phase II dose-finding study of Defibrotide (DF), a polydisperse oligonucleotide, with anti-thrombotic, anti-ischemic and thrombolytic properties, especially on microvasculature. Earlier studies of DF therapy for VOD/MOF have consistently shown manageable toxicity with promising complete response (CR) rates and d+100 survival post SCT. Methods: We reviewed pts to define status of renal, pulmonary, and CNS dysfunction at entry and on DF therapy. We also determined dialysis dependence (DD) and/or ventilator dependence (VD) at study entry or when newly acquired while on study. These subgroups were examined for response to treatment (CR vs no CR) and d+100 survival. Results: Of 139 pts treated, 97 had creatinine (creat) \u2265 2x admission value at study entry, of whom 42 pts had creat \u2265 3x admission value, and 12 were DD. 35 pts developed new DD on DF therapy. At entry, 69 pts had room air O 2 saturation \u2264 90%, 10 were VD and 34 developed new VD on DF therapy. 33 pts were encephalopathic at study entry and 23 became encephalopathic during treatment. CR was achieved in 59/124 (48%) evaluable pts. By Kaplan Meier and on intent to treat, d+100 survival was 51/133 (38%). Pts were analyzed according to MOF (Table 1). In those with both renal and pulmonary dysfunction at study entry, 44% achieved CR and 39% d+100 survival. Pts with renal or pulmonary dysfunction at study entry, combined with encephalopathy, had a CR rate of 55% and d+100 survival of 45%. Those with MOF in all 3 systems achieved a CR rate of 50%, although d+100 survival was lower at 33%. The presence of DD at study entry or newly acquired on DF therapy reduced CR rates to 33 and 20% respectively, with a similar reduction in CR rates for VD at 20 and 25%. D+100 survival in both categories was also reduced. Conclusion: DF therapy achieved encouraging CR rates and d+100 survival in pts with MOF in up to three systems complicating VOD post SCT, and clinical benefit was seen even if pts were DD and/or VD. However, CR rates and d+100 survival were lower with DD and/or VD both at study entry and when newly acquired on DF therapy, which suggests that earlier intervention with DF may further improve outcome.
