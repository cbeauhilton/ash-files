    "abstract_text": "The caudal -type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) plays an important role in embryonic development and regulates the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells in the adult. Ectopic expression of CDX2 in the hematopoietic compartment was previously identified as the key pathogenetic event in a single patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and t(12;13)(p13;q12). Using real-time quantitative PCR, we detected aberrant CDX2 expression in 153 (90%) of 170 patients with AML, in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome or advanced-stage chronic myeloid leukemia, and in several AML cell lines, but not in bone marrow derived from normal individuals. Expression of CDX2 was monoallelic in the majority of cases with informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CDX2 coding region, but was not related to mutations in the CDX2 coding region or in the predicted CDX2 promoter sequence, gene-specific hypomethylation of the CDX2 promoter, or increased CDX2 gene copy numbers. Stable knockdown of CDX2 expression by lentivirus-mediated RNA interference inhibited the proliferation of various human AML cell lines exhibiting CDX2 transcript levels that were in the range of those observed in most primary AML samples, and strongly reduced their clonogenic potential in vitro . Primary murine hematopoietic progenitor cells transduced with Cdx2 acquired serial replating activity in vitro , could be continuously propagated in liquid culture, generated a fully penetrant and transplantable AML in vivo , and displayed dysregulated expression of Hox family members. Together, these results (i) demonstrate that aberrant expression of CDX2 is a frequent event in myeloid leukemogenesis, (ii) suggest a role for CDX2 as part of a common effector pathway that increases the proliferative capacity and promotes the self-renewal potential of hematopoietic progenitors, and (iii) support the unifying hypothesis that CDX2 is responsible, at least in part, for abnormalities in HOX gene expression in AML.",
