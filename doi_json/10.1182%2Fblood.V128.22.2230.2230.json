    "abstract_text": "Background Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the primary means for treatment of hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a major complication associated with high morbidity and mortality after transplantation. Regulatory \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (\u03b3\u03b4 Tregs), as a novel subset of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with Foxp3 expression and immunosuppressive effect, are found to effectively alleviate aGVHD in mice model. However, whether \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs involve in the occurrence of aGVHD in recipients of allo-HSCT remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs in the occurrence of aGVHD in recipients of allo-HSCT. Methods The immunophenotyping of \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs was analyzed in peripheral blood from 24 aGVHD and 24 paired non-aGVHD patients (undergoing transplantation at the same time, basic data matched), using flow cytometry. The expression levels of immunoregulatory-associated molecules (Foxp3, CD25, CTLA-4, GITR, TLR8, RORc, STAT-1 and STAT-3) were analyzed in peripheral blood, using real-time RT-PCR with SYBR Green\u2160staining. Liquichip technology was used to analyze the concentration of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-10, IL-17 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in cultural supernatant. Results The proportions of total \u03b3\u03b4 T and V\u03b42 T cells in non-aGVHD patients were significantly higher than that in aGVHD patients ( P =0.044, P =0.000), and the proportion of V\u03b41 T cells was similar between the two groups ( P =0.061). Compared with aGVHD patients, the proportions of Foxp3 + \u03b3\u03b4 T, Foxp3 + V\u03b41 T, Foxp3 + V\u03b42 T cells and Tregs were increased in non-aGVHD patients ( P =0.005, P =0.014, P =0.026 and P =0.000). There was a negative correlation between the incidence of aGVHD and the percentages of Foxp3 + \u03b3\u03b4 T, Foxp3 + V\u03b41 T and Foxp3 + V\u03b42 T cells ( P =0.014, r s =-0.477; P =0.001, r s =-0.610; P =0.040, r s =-0.405). The mRNA expression levels of Foxp3 and TLR8 genes were significantly increased in non-aGVHD patients compared with aGVHD patients ( P =0.042, P =0.002). There were no significant difference in the expression levels of CD25, RORc, CTLA-4, GITR, STAT-1 and STAT-3 genes ( P =0.234, P =0.194, P =0.056, P =0.524, P =0.142 and P =0.775). In addition, the concentrations of IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly increased in aGVHD patients ( P =0.002, P =0.036), and the concentrations of IL-4, IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 were similar between the two groups ( P =0.379, P =0.414, P =0.170). Conclusions Increase of \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs might reduce the incidence of aGVHD after allo-HSCT. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
