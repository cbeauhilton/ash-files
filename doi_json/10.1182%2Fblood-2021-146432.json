    "abstract_text": "Introduction Long-term follow up of prospective studies has shown that continuous Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) therapy leads to durable remissions in previously untreated TP53- altered CLL. Additionally, combining BTKi with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax (VEN) achieves deep remissions with similar rates of undetectable measurable residual disease in these high-risk patients (pts) compared to those with wildtype TP53 . Without randomized data, it is unclear which pts would benefit most from combined targeted therapy over BTKi monotherapy. It is also unknown how size of the TP53 -altered clone influences efficacy of BTKi therapy. We performed a retrospective analysis of pts with CLL with baseline deletion 17p [del(17p)] and/or mutated TP53 ( TP53 -m) treated with BTKi +/- VEN +/- CD20 mAb in the first-line setting. Methods Pts with CLL/SLL and pretreatment testing (FISH and TP53 sequencing by NGS assay in >95% of pts with 1% limit of detection) performed at our institution (MDACC) demonstrating del(17p) and/or TP53 -m who received first-line BTKi-based therapy were included. Pts started treatment between March 2012 and June 2021. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) from therapy start. Pts were categorized into those who received first-line BTKi +/- CD20 mAb versus combined BTKi and fixed-duration VEN +/- CD20 mAb. Outcomes were analyzed by baseline characteristics, including size of the TP53 -altered clone (% cells with del(17p) and variant allele frequency [VAF] for TP53 -m). Results A total of 140 pts with TP53 alteration who received first-line BTKi-based treatment for CLL were included. Pretreatment characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . The median follow-up was 3.0 years (range, 0.1 to 9.0). Overall, a total of 38 (27%) pts experienced a progression event, 18 (13%) pts died, and 10 (7%) experienced RT. The 4-year PFS rate was 72.7% and median PFS was 6.3 years ( Fig. 1A ). The 4-year OS rate was 87.2% ( Fig. 1B ). A total of 112/140 (80%) pts had pretreatment del(17p). The median % of cells with del(17p) was 60.5% (range, 3.5-99). TP53 -m was noted in 100 of the 120 (83%) tested. There were 120 unique TP53 mutations, of which 115 had an available VAF; the median VAF was 34.1% (range, 1-99.5). Among the pts tested for both del(17p) and TP53 -m (n=120), 42 (35%) pts had a single alteration [del(17p) or single TP53 -m] and 78 (65%) had multiple alterations [both del(17p) and  TP53 -m or multiple TP53 -m]. By univariable analyses, no baseline characteristic was significantly associated with PFS. PFS was not different for TP53 -m pts based a VAF threshold of 10% ( Fig. 2A ) and del(17p) pts based on a threshold of 25% cells affected ( Fig. 2B ). No baseline characteristic was associated with OS. A total of 101 (72%) pts received a BTKi +/- CD20 mAb without VEN; 39 (28%) received BTKi and VEN (+/- CD20 mAb) (4 pts included who did not get VEN due to early study withdrawal or data censoring). PFS was significantly longer for BTKi + VEN pts vs. BTKi only pts (p=0.009, Fig. 3A ) with a HR of 0.18 (95% CI 0.04-0.77) and there was a trend for longer OS in BTKi + VEN pts (p=0.092, Fig. 3B ) with a HR of 0.21 (95% CI 0.03-1.57). BTKi + VEN pts were less likely to harbor TP53- m (69% v 90%, p=0.008) or multi-alteration TP53 (44% v 75%, p<0.001), but no other baseline characteristics were significantly different ( Table 1 ). A total of 28/140 (20%) pts received a CD20 mAb. There was no significant association of CD20 mAb with PFS (p=0.54). Conclusions We report favorable 4-year PFS and OS rates of 72.7% and 87.2% in a large retrospective cohort of pts with TP53 -altered CLL receiving first-line BTKi-based therapy. The clone size either by % FISH+ or by TP53 -m VAF was not associated with PFS, which may reflect the high efficacy of BTKi. PFS appears longer for pts treated with BTK + VEN compared to BTKi only pts, and there was a trend towards improved OS. Though the BTKi + VEN group had lower rates of TP53 -m and multiple TP53 alterations, neither characteristic was associated with shorter PFS. Heterogeneity in patient follow-up and response assessment schedule across this pt cohort could be a confounding factor. Whether combination fixed-duration BTKi + VEN is preferable over sequential treatment with these agents remains an unanswered question; this is especially pertinent in pts with high-risk genomics. Therefore, studies dedicated to enrolling such patients are needed to formally clarify optimal treatment for these high-risk patients.
