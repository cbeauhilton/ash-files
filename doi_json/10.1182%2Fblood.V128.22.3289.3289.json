    "abstract_text": "Introduction High expression of the H3K27 histone methyltransferase EZH2 mRNA in myeloma (MM) patient samples is associated with molecular features of high risk disease, including increased proliferation, and adverse outcomes (1). Mutations or deletions in the H3K27 demethylase KDM6A are associated with similar findings (2) and would be expected to have the same epigenetic effect, increasing H3K27me3 levels, a mark associated with repression of gene expression. We, therefore, sought to identify the role EZH2 plays in controlling myeloma cell proliferation. Methods A panel of MM cell lines and primary patient samples (CD138 selected from bone marrow with consent) representing a variety of different MM molecular subgroups were used. Cell viability (WST-1), cell cycle (PI) and apoptosis (AnnexinV/PI, Caspase-Glo 3/7) assays were performed. Affymetrix gene expression arrays followed by validation with RT-PCR were used to identify patterns of gene expression change with EZH2i. Western blotting confirmed changes at the protein level and Chip-PCR was performed using a validated antibody and isotype control to identify H3K27me3 changes at the relevant gene promotors. Affymetrix gene expression data for 1213 patients enrolled in the Total Therapy studies were used to investigate the relevance of our findings in myeloma patient samples. Results We confirmed a reduction in viability following EZH2i using two chemically distinct, specific small molecule inhibitors (EPZ005687 and UNC1999) and the negative control compound UNC2400. There was a reduction in viability in 6/8 cell lines and 5/6 patient samples. Response to inhibition was not related to molecular subgroup or the presence of high-risk molecular features including del17p. Global levels of H3K27me3 measured by Western blot were reduced in all cell lines regardless of response to EZH2i. In responding cell lines EZH2i induced cell cycle arrest at G1/S followed by induction of apoptosis. Gene expression arrays performed using mRNA from KMS11 and KMM1 cell lines highlighted a change in expression of cell cycle control genes associated with EZH2i. This finding was validated using qRT-PCR, which demonstrated upregulation of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN2B , CDKN1A or both. These findings were confirmed at the protein level by Western blotting. Chip-PCR experiment using cell lysates from KMS11 cells following incubation with EZH2i over 6 days identified changes in H3K27me3 at the promoter and transcriptional start site (PROM/TSS) regions of the CDKN2B and CDKN1A genes. The most specific changes occurred at the CDKN1A PROM/TSS, which were more heavily marked with H3K27me3 at baseline compared to a region approx. 5KB upstream. Given these results, which suggest that CDKN1A expression may be controlled by changes in H3K27me3, we explored the effect of CDKN1A mRNA expression in our patient datasets. We found the expression of EZH2 and CDKN1A to be inversely correlated (R=-0.170, p<0.0001) and that low expression of CDKN1A was associated with a significantly shorter progression free and overall survival (p<0.001). In order to confirm whether these gene expression changes could be used as a potential biomarker of response we looked at our panel of cell lines with variable responses to EZH2i. We identified a consistent increase in expression of CDKN1A only in responding cell lines suggesting it could be used as a biomarker of efficacy in the clinic. Conclusions These data support the hypothesis that CDKN1A expression is suppressed by increased H3K27me3, due to high expression of EZH2 and that this can be reversed with pharmacological EZH2 inhibition leading to a reduction in proliferation of myeloma cells. We provide data which supports the investigation of EZH2i in clinical trials of myeloma patients, which has the potential to be an effective therapeutic strategy even for those with high-risk disease, for whom current treatment approaches are ineffective.
