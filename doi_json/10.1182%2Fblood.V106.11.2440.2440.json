    "abstract_text": "Introduction Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is an important mechanism in the clinical activity of rituximab for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. The NK cells, through the activating receptor Fc\u03b3RIIIa, play a major role in the rituximab-mediated ADCC. We have studied the effect of NK stimulators such IL-15 and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) in the enhancement of rituximab-mediated ADCC against B-cell lymphoma. Methods ADCC was performed by standard 51 Cr release assays using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) purified from 4 normal volunteers by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation. Cells were cultured for 18 hours in the presence of human recombinant interleukin 15 (rhIL-15; 10 ng/ml) or CpG ODN (2,5 \u03bcg/ml). The B-lymphoma cell line Raji was used as target in the presence of rituximab (10 \u03bcg/ml) or human IgG1 as control (10 \u03bcg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Target cells and effector cells were incubated at different ratios ranging from 1:1 to 30:1, for 4 hours at 37\u00b0C. The polymorphism at amino acid 158 of the activating Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor (Fc\u03b3RIIIa V\u2192F) was analyzed in effector cells from normal donors with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based allele-specific restriction analysis assay. Results Lysis of B lymphoma cells treated with rituximab alone was 40% \u00b1 5% (mean \u00b1 SD) at the highest ratio, as compared to 12% \u00b1 7% (p<0.001) in the presence of human IgG1 control. When the effector cells were treated with IL-15, a dramatic increase in the lysis of lymphoma cells was observed (70% \u00b1 8% vs. 40% \u00b1 5%, IL-15 plus rituximab vs. rituximab alone) (p<0.001). Effector cells treated with CpG ODN showed a significant increase in rituximab-mediated cytotoxicity (84% \u00b1 2% vs. 53% \u00b1 16%) (CpG ODN vs. control, respectively; p=0.03). The enhancement of rituximab-mediated ADCC when the effector cells were treated with IL-15 or CpG ODN was similar for both Fc\u03b3RIIIa-V/V and Fc\u03b3RIIIa-V/F genotypes on effector cells. Conclusion PBMC cells activated in the presence of IL-15 or CpG ODN become strong effectors in rituximab-mediated ADCC against B cell lymphoma. These results may be useful to improve the therapeutic activity of rituximab.",
