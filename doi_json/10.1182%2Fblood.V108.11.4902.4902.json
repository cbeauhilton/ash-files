    "abstract_text": "Idiopathic HES is a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) characterized by persistent overproduction of eosinophils resulting in organ damage. In a small subset of patients (pts), the disease is caused by the FIP1L1-PDGFR-\u03b1 fusion tyrosine kinase. Its expression has been associated with complete clinical responses to therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib mesylate. In contrast, there is no specific therapy for pts with HES lacking FIP1L1-PDGFR-\u03b1 expression and corticosteroids are used for palliation. Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H \u2122 ) is a humanized rat monoclonal antibody directed against the CD52 antigen. Since CD52 is expressed on eosinophils, we evaluated its efficacy in pts with FIP1L1-PDGFR-\u03b1-negative symptomatic HES. A total of 9 pts (5 male, 4 female) received alemtuzumab in weekly cycles at the dose of 30 (8 pts) or 10 (1 pt) mg 3 times a week intravenously or subcutaneously. During the first week alemtuzumab was given in escalating doses (3\u219210\u219230mg) to assure tolerance. Median age was 53 years (range 24\u201370), time from HES diagnosis to alemtuzumab therapy 34 months (range 4\u2013195), median WBC 17\u00d710 9 /L (range 6.9\u201382.4), absolute eosinophil count (AEC) 9\u00d710 9 /L (range 0.7\u201330), and bone marrow eosinophils 23% (range 10\u201368). Three pts had abnormal cytogenetics: del11(q23), +8, and t(5;6). Pts had received a median of 3 prior therapies (range 2\u20136), including corticosteroids (prednisone; n=9), imatinib (n=7), dasatinib (n=3), interferon-alpha (n=3), hydroxyurea (n=3), nilotinib (n=2), and cladribine (n=2). A total of 121 weekly cycles have been administered (median 13 cycles) thus far. A complete hematologic response (CHR; i.e. AEC normalization) was observed in 8 pts (89%) within 4 weeks of therapy; peripheral blood eosinophils were undetectable in 6 of 8 CHR pts. Follow-up bone marrow specimens were available in 3 pts while in CHR (after a median of 5.5 weekly alemtuzumab cycles) showing complete response in 2 and partial response in 1 pt. In addition, 3 pts that were on prednisone and 2 on hydroxyurea at the start of alemtuzumab discontinued them within 2 weeks into therapy. One pt had a remarkable partial response with reduction of AEC from 47.5 to 1\u00d710 9 /L after 8 weekly cycles of alemtuzumab; this patient was on 3g of hydroxyurea and 80mg of prednisone at the start of alemtuzumab and was able to discontinue hydroxyurea and decrease prednisone to 10mg while on alemtuzumab. Five pts who stopped alemtuzumab experienced relapse after a median time of 3.5 weeks (range, 1 to 10) and 1 relapsed while receiving alemtuzumab after 14 weekly cycles. Three pts are currently on alemtuzumab: 2 receiving 30 mg weekly as maintenance while in CHR after 8+ and 19+ weeks, respectively, and 1 with partial response is receiving 30mg 3 times a week. One relapsed pt was rechallenged with alemtuzumab and normalized AEC again. Alemtuzumab was generally well tolerated. Grade 3\u20134 drug-related toxicities occurred in 2 pts, 1 with neutropenia and 1 with infusion-related fever, which led to transient and complete alemtuzumab discontinuation, respectively. Two pts experienced CMV reactivation that required therapy. In summary, alemtuzumab was well tolerated and has remarkable activity in pts with FIP1L1-PDGFR-\u03b1-negative HES. Different dose schedules of alemtuzumab that include prolonged maintenance therapy are warranted to improve the response duration. Updated clinical results will be presented.",
