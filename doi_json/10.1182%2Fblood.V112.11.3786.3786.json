    "abstract_text": "Expression of meningioma 1 (MN1) has been proposed to be a negative prognostic marker in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In pediatric leukemia, we found overexpression of MN1 in 53 of 88 cases: whereas no MN1 expression was detected in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), significant amounts of MN1 were found in immature B-cell ALL and most cases of infant leukemia. Interestingly, 17 of 19 cases harboring fusion genes involving the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL-X) gene showed elevated MN1 expression. Lentiviral siRNA mediated MN1 knock-down resulted in cell cycle arrest and impaired clonogenic growth of 3 MLL-X-positive human leukemia cell lines overexpressing MN1 (THP-1, RS4;11, MOLM-13). In a mouse model of MLL-ENL-induced leukemia we found MN1 to be overexpressed as a consequence of provirus integration. Strikingly co-expression of MN1 with MLL-ENL resulted in significantly reduced latency for induction of an AML phenotype in mice suggesting functional cooperation. Immunophenotyping and secondary transplant experiments suggested that MN1 overexpression seems to expand the L-GMP cell population targeted by the MLL-ENL fusion. Gene expression profiling allowed defining a number of potential MN1 hematopoietic targets. Upregulation of CD34, FLT3, HLF, or DLK1 was validated in bone marrow transiently overexpressing MN1, in MN1-induced mouse acute myeloid leukemia, as well as in pediatric leukemias with elevated MN1 levels. Our work shows that MN1 is overexpressed in a significant fraction of pediatric acute leukemia, is essential for growth of leukemic cells, and that MN1 can act as a cooperating oncogene with MLL-ENL most probably through modification of a distinct gene expression program that leads to expansion of a leukemic progenitor population targeted by MLL-fusion genes."
