    "abstract_text": "Background: PRM-151 (PRM) is a recombinant form of pentraxin-2, an endogenous human protein that acts at sites of tissue damage, inducing macrophage differentiation to prevent and reverse fibrosis. 27 patients with primary myelofibrosis (MF), post-essential thrombocythemia MF, or post-polycythemia vera MF and Grade 2 or 3 bone marrow (BM) fibrosis enrolled in the first stage of a 2-stage adaptive trial in which PRM-151 10 mg/kg IV was administered for 24 weeks in four different arms: PRM-151 QW (n=8), PRM-151 Q4W (n=7), PRM-151 QW + ruxolitinib (RUX) (n=6), or PRM-151 Q4W + RUX (n=6). At 24 weeks, reductions in BM fibrosis, improvements in hemoglobin (Hgb) and platelets (PLT), decreases in symptoms (MPN-SAF Total Symptom Score [TSS]), and modest reductions in spleen size by palpation were observed in all arms, with a favorable safety profile (Verstovsek, ASH 2014, Abstract 713). Patients experiencing clinical benefit were allowed to continue beyond 24 weeks. We now report efficacy and safety in 13 patients who have completed at least 72 weeks of treatment. Bone marrow fibrosis status by morphologic WHO grading and computer-assisted image analysis (CIA) are available up to 48 weeks in some patients, as assessed by central hematopathologist reviewers blinded to patient, treatment, and timepoint. BM data through 72 weeks is pending. WHO response was defined as \u22651 grade reduction in MF grade at any time and CIA response was defined as a decrease in the % fibrosis compared to baseline with a negative slope > 1. (Pozdnyakova, EHA 2015, Abstract P677). Baseline Demographics (N=13): Median age 60 (51-76); 46% DIPSS Int-1, 54% DIPSS Int-2; 62% PMF, 15% post-ET MF, 23% post-PV MF; 46% grade 3 BM fibrosis, Hgb < 100 g/L in 38%, PLT < 100 x 10 9 /L in 69% and <50 x 10 9 /L in 38%; 31% JAK inhibitor-naive and 69% received a prior or current JAK inhibitor. Study treatment (N=13): In the first 24 weeks, treatment was PRM-151 QW (n=5), PRM-151 Q4W (n=3), PRM-151 QW + RUX (n=2), PRM-151 Q4W + RUX (n=3). At 28 weeks, treatment changed to PRM-151 QW (n=2), PRM-151 Q4W (n=7), and PRM-151 Q4W + RUX (n=4), with 1 patient stopping RUX for thrombocytopenia. Both PRM-151 QW patients switched to PRM-151 Q4W after 40 and 52 weeks. Two patients missed weeks 64 and 68 due to complications of a motor vehicle accident and abdominal surgery, respectively, but are continuing treatment as of week 72. BM (n=13): 54% had a morphologic response, and 85% had a CIA response. Hgb (g/L): In 5 pts with baseline Hgb < 100, median Hgb increased by 24% from 86 (range 77-97) at baseline to 107 (range 71-113) at Week 72. 3 of 5 patients who were receiving transfusions at baseline became transfusion independent, with durations of 32-60 weeks. (Figure 1) PLT (x 10 9 /L): In 9 pts with baseline < 100, median PLT count increased by 37% from 38 (range 10-89) at baseline to 52 (range 26-159) at Week 72. All 4 patients who were receiving PLT transfusions at baseline became transfusion independent, with durations of 24-44 weeks. (Figure 2) Symptoms (N=13): 69% and 38% of patients had \u2265 50% and 100% reductions from baseline in TSS between 24 and 72 weeks, with durations of up to 48 and 12 weeks, respectively. (Figure 3) Spleen (N= 9 with palpable spleens at baseline): 50% of pts had \u226525% reduction, 2 of whom had \u226550% reduction lasting > 12 weeks. (Figure 4) Safety (N=13): Most common adverse events (AEs) regardless of relatedness were fatigue (4), nausea (3), fever (3), cough (2), diarrhea (2), tooth infection (2), headache (2), upper respiratory infection (2), hyperglycemia (2), and hyperuricemia (2). There were 13 possibly or probably related adverse events in 3 patients from beginning of study through 71 weeks, 11 Grade 1, 1 Grade 2 and 1 Grade 3, with no event occurring in > 1 patient. There were no related serious AEs in these patients. Conclusion: In 13 patients completing at least 72 weeks, PRM-151 treatment was well tolerated, and improvements in Hgb, PLT, symptoms and spleen appeared to increase with longer treatment duration.
