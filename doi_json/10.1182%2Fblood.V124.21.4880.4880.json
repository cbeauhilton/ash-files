    "abstract_text": "Background Biosimilar drugs have a similar, but usually not inferior although not hidentical effects of old registred drugs. Safety is hidentical to old registred drug. Aims Aim of this study is to verify if in MDS patient with refractory anemia biosimilar erythropoietin alpha is not inferior to erythropoietin alpha in terms of safety, efficacy and costs. Methods This study is a dicentric, nonrandomized, retrospective study. Between july 2008 and june 2012, 92 patients affected by refractory anemia were studied. Median follow-up was 22 months (R3-34). Patients received in group A erythropoietin alpha 40000 IU sc/weekly. In group B patient received biosimilar erythropoietin alpha 40000 IU sc/weekly. In both groups patients received liposomal iron (Sideral \u00ae ) 14 mg, 2 tablets orally/day calcium levofolinate 7.5 mg/day orally + Vitamin B12: 400 mg/day orally. In group A median age was 70 years (R63-75), M/F: 18/28; in group B median age was 64 years (R60-70), M/F: 25/21. IPSS was low in 30 patients and int-1 in 13 patients in group A, and low in 32 patients and int-1 in 11 patients, in group B. Patients with 5q- were excluded from this study. Median level of haemoglobin was 8.5 g/dl in group A (R8-11) and 9.2 g/dl (R8.5-11.5) in group B. Results Group A patients increased Hb level of 1 g/dl after a median time of 5 weeks (R4-9) and after a median time of 4 weeks (R3-8) in group B. No relevant side effects were observed in both groups. Erythropoietin alpha was reduced in group A because Hb achieved a level > 12g/dl after a median of 12 weeks (R 4-18). Biosimilar erythropoietin alpha was reduced in group B because Hb achieved a level > 12g/dl after a median of 10.5 weeks (R 3-16). In group A maintenance dose was administered with a median of every two weeks (2-4), In group B maintenance dose was administered with a median of every three weeks (2-5). Median cost for every month of erythropoietic therapy was 1536 euros/month (R1240-1850) in group A and 1354 euros/month (R954-1550) in group B. Five patients need transfusion support in group A and seven patients need transfusion support in group B Summary/conclusion Biosimilar erythropoietin alpha plus liposomal iron (Sideral \u00ae ) and B12 and folates support seems to be safe, feasible, probably equally cost-effective and substantially not inferior to classical erythropoietin alpha support in patients affected by refractory anemia. This study needs confifrmation on a larger cohort of patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
