    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2058 Poster Board II-35 Therapy of AML for elderly pts (\u2265 60 yrs) remains challenging with low response rates, short durability of responses, and high toxicity rates following conventional therapy with standard-dose ara-C/anthracycline combinations. Clofarabine is a novel deoxyadenosine nucleoside analogue with single agent activity in frontline AML for older pts with \u2265 1 unfavorable prognostic factors. We have recently reported results of a randomized study suggesting higher response rates and comparable safety profile with the combination of clofarabine plus low-dose cytarabine over clofarabine alone. We have designed the current study of clofarabine plus low-dose cytarabine induction followed by consolidation with clofarabine plus low-dose cytarabine alternating with decitabine to maintain high response rates and improve disease-free survival based on the following hypotheses: 1) to extend duration of therapy by administering lower doses of the agents; and 2) to provide multiple drugs with different mechanisms of action to decrease risk of resistance. Pts were eligible if \u2265 60 yrs of age with newly diagnosed AML. Pts were excluded for ECOG PS > 2, creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL, cardiac ejection fraction < 40%, and prior therapy with clofarabine or decitabine. Induction therapy consisted of clofarabine 20mg/m 2 i.v daily \u00d7 5 days plus cytarabine 20mg s.c. twice daily \u00d7 10 days in a laminar air flow room. Responding pts could receive up to 17 courses of consolidation therapy of clofarabine plus cytarabine (over 3 and 7 days, respectively) during consolidation courses 1-2, 6-8, 12-14) alternating with decitabine 20mg/m 2 i.v. daily for 5 days during courses 3-5, 9-11, and 15-17. All pts received antibiotic prophylaxis with levofloxacin, valacyclovir and itraconazole (or equivalent). Forty pts have been enrolled with a median age of 70 yrs (range 60-80) of whom 22 (55%) had secondary AML (antecedent hematologic disorder in 11 pts). Two pts had received previous azacitidine for MDS. Fourteen pts (35%) had abnormal cytogenetics of whom 10 (25%) had monosomy 5, 7, or both. Four patients (10%) had a FLT3/ITD mutation. Of the 34 pts evaluable for response, 20 (59%) achieved CR and 2 (6%) CRp for an OR rate of 65%. Only 2 pts required 2 courses to CR. The OR rate for patients with diploid versus abnormal cytogenetics was 80% vs 50%; for pts with prior MDS versus no prior MDS 76% and 50%; and 75% for patients with FLT3 mutation. The median time to CR/CRp was 38 days (range 27-103). With a median follow up of 3.5 months (range 0.7-8.1), 2 pts relapsed (CR duration of 3.3 and 4.2 months, respectively); responses are ongoing in the remainder. Three pts (9%) died during induction therapy (one during re-induction) before a response could be established. The median number of consolidation cycles received by pts in CR was 3 (range 1-5). Most toxicities were \u2264 grade 2 and included nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, rash, headache and mucositis. Six pts developed grade 3 elevations in serum transaminases which resolved at the end of induction therapy. Myelosuppression and neutropenic fever were common, but prolonged myelosuppression was rare. In conclusion, clofarabine plus low-dose cytarabine achieves high response rates with a manageable toxicity profile and low induction mortality in elderly pts with previously untreated AML. Time-to-event parameters will be provided with more extensive follow up. Disclosures: Off Label Use: Clofarabine and Decitabine in AML. Kantarjian: Genzyme: Consultancy, Research Funding.
