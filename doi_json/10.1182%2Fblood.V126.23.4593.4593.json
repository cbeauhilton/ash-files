    "abstract_text": "Background: Low back pain is a very common and costly problem that results in significant morbidity. When patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) present with back pain, physicians often assume that their pain is related to an acute painful crisis or to chronic pain caused by bone infarcts in the spinal column resulting in \"H\" shaped vertebral bodies. The occurrence of vertebral osteonecrosis in SCD patients is a well-documented cause of back pain and is noted on radiographs and often confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, as with all presentations of pain in persons with SCD, the etiology can also be non-SCD related and should be fully evaluated. This case series profiles six patients with SCD who presented with back pain and underwent further assessment. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of six patients with SCD (mean age of 30.8 years) who presented with back pain during 2014. Institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained from the Medical University of South Carolina for retrospective chart review. All of the patients were seen in the Comprehensive Lifespan Sickle Cell Clinic for regular evaluation. These patients underwent further evaluation due to presenting symptoms of increased pain, change in quality or character of pain, or associated neuropathic complaints. Results: Three of the patients who presented with neuropathic symptoms were noted to have other (non-SCD) etiologies of back pain (facet cyst, vertebral disc protrusion) as outlined in Table 2. The etiology of the other three patients who presented with increased frequency of baseline pain was secondary to complications of SCD (Table 1). Table 1.

These cases demonstrate that other etiologies of back pain can be seen and should be treated in patients with SCD. In addition, there is substantial evidence linking obesity (increased BMI) and incidence of low back pain (as also seen in several of these patients). Thus, enhanced primary care, including attention to obesity and diet, is also imperative in this patient population. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
