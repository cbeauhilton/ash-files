    "abstract_text": "Introduction Prognosis for relapsed and refractory large B-cell lymphoma (r/r LBCL) is poor, and treatment remains challenging. Relmacabtagene autoleucel (relma-cel) is a CD19-directed 4-1BB/CD3z chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) product manufactured in China. RELIANCE study is the first CAR-T study with CD19 as target that got IND approved by the authority in China. Initial findings of the pivotal Phase 2 single-arm, multicenter RELIANCE trial demonstrated high response rates and low rates of CAR-T-associated toxicity with relma-cel treatment in heavily pretreated patients (pts) with r/r LBCL (NCT04089215; Ying et al.  Cancer Med 2020;10:999-1011). Long-term follow-up data for the RELIANCE study are presented. Materials & Methods Fifty-nine adults (age \u226518 years) with heavily pretreated (\u22652 prior therapies), measurable and histologically confirmed r/r LBCL were randomized to receive lymphodepletion chemotherapy (LDC: fludarabine 25 mg/m 2 + cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m 2 daily\u00d73) followed by a single infusion of autologous CAR+ T cells at a dose of 100\u00d710 6 or 150\u00d710 6 . Pts were evaluated for efficacy using Lugano criteria and for toxicity using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03 and for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) using Lee et al . ( Blood 2014;124(2):188-95). Primary endpoint was 3-month objective response rate (ORR); key secondary endpoints included complete response rate (CRR) at 3 months, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) profile. The data cutoff date was December 31, 2020. Results At the time of analysis, all 59 pts (median age 56.0 years, range 18-75 years) were at least 15 months post-treatment with relma-cel (7 pts completed trial, 34 pts on study, 18 pts withdrew). Among the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population of 58 efficacy-evaluable pts, best ORR was 77.6%, with a best CRR of 51.7%; ORR and CRR at 3-month-postdose landmark were 60.3% and 44.8%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 17.9 months (range 0.3-25.6 months), median PFS (mITT) was 7.0 months (95% CI 4.8-not reached [NR]). Median PFS was NR (95% CI 8.8 months-NR) for pts with compete response (CR) at 3 months, the 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month PFS rates were 80.8%, 69.2%, 69.2% and 69.2%, respectively (Figure). PFS was associated with objective response or CR at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (log-rank test, p \u22640.002). Median OS was NR (95% CI NR-NR) for both the mITT population and pts with CR at 3 months (12-month OS rate, 76.8% and 92.3%, respectively). Median DOR was NR (95% CI 4.9 months-NR) for the mITT population and (95% CI 8.0 months-NR) for pts with CR at 3 months. Levels of CAR-T cells declined to below the level of quantification (BLQ) in 41 (69.5%) pts, among whom nearly 40% had sustained response. Median time from documentation of CAR-T BLQ to disease progression was 6.1 months (95% CI 1.8-NR). Treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 93.2% of pts and were primarily grade 1-2 (89.8% pts); 54.2% of pts had grade \u22653 TEAEs. Pyrexia was the most common TEAE, reported in 59.3% of pts (all grade 1-2). The most common grade \u22653 treatment-related TEAEs were neutrophil count decrease (30.5%) and white blood cell (WBC) count decrease (13.6%). Presence of cytopenia at day 29 (78.0%) was significantly associated with WBC count after LDC, change in serum albumin between days 1 and 4 and serum interleukin 8 after LDC ( p <0.05). The incidence of CRS and neurotoxicity (NT) was 47.5% and 20.3%, respectively, both primarily grade 1-2. There were no CRS- or NT-related deaths. Occurrence of grade \u22652 CRS or NT (11.9% and 6.8%, respectively) was significantly associated with fold-change of platelet count on day 4 compared with baseline and day 1 absolute neutrophil count (p<0.03). There were no treatment-related deaths. Conclusions These are the first data of long-term follow-up CD19 CAR-T study with IND approval in China reported. With nearly 18 months of median follow-up, the RELIANCE pivotal registered study demonstrated durable responses, high rates of OS and PFS, and no new safety profile found in r/r LBCL pts. Based on these data, relma-cel is undergoing approval in China.
