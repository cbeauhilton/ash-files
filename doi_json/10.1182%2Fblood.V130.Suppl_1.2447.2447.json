    "abstract_text": "Background: GATA2 deficiency is an increasingly recognized bone marrow failure syndrome responsible for: MonoMAC, monocytopenia with atypical mycobacterial infection (MAC); DCML, dendritic cell, monocyte and lymphoid cell deficiency; Emberger syndrome with lymphedema and monosomy 7; and familial myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). GATA2 deficiency can be reversed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, the intensity of conditioning required to ensure engraftment and reverse the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) characteristic of the disease remains controversial. Methods: We carried out a prospective study of allogeneic HSCT in 22 patients (mean age 26 years; range 17 to 45 years) with GATA2 deficiency, or the MonoMac syndrome, using a myeloablative, busulfan-based conditioning regimen. All 22 patients had MDS and two had AML. Eleven patients had clonal cytogenetic changes in the bone marrow. There were two matched related donor (MRD) recipients, 13 matched unrelated donor (URD) recipients, and 7 haploidentical related donor recipients. MRD and URD recipients received conditioning with 4 days of busulfan (days -6 to -3) to target an AUC between 3600 and 4800 min*microm/L and 4 days of fludarabine 40 mg/m 2 /day (days -6 to -3). Haploidentical related donor recipients received low-dose cyclophosphamide for two days (days -6 and -5), fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days (days -6 to -2), 2-3 days of busulfan depending upon cytogenetics, along with 200 cGY total body irradiation (TBI) on day -1. MRD and URD recipients received tacrolimus and short course methotrexate for post-transplant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, whereas haploidentical recipients received high-dose post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT/CY) followed by tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for GVHD prophylaxis. Results: Nineteen of the 22 patients are alive with resolution of the clinical phenotype and correction of the bone marrow MDS with eradication of the cytogenetic changes at a median follow-up of 23 months (range, 6 to 48 months) giving an overall disease-free survival of 86 percent. The three deaths all occurred in the URD group. Of the three deaths, one resulted from refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and two from complications related to treatment for GVHD. There was a 26 percent incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) in the MRD and URD groups, and no grade III-IV aGVHD in the haploidentical related donor cohort. Similarly, there was a 46 percent incidence of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) in the MRD and URD cohort, whereas two of the 7 (28 percent) of the haploidentical related donor recipients had cGVHD. Conclusions: Despite overall disease-free survival of 86 percent with eradication of the clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in the bone marrow, GVHD remains a limitation in the MRD and URD cohorts treated with standard post-transplant tacrolimus/methotrexate prophylaxis for GVHD. We are currently de-escalating the busulfan dosing based on the AUC in all cohorts and incorporating PT/CY in the MRD and URD cohorts to decrease toxicity and reduce the incidence of aGVHD and cGVHD. Together with our previous studies using a nonmyeloablative regimen, it appears that when GATA2 deficiency patients are transplanted when they have a hypocellular bone marrow with MDS and without cytogenetic changes, a nonmyeloablative regimen results in reliable engraftment in GATA2 deficiency since the GATA2 deficient marrow has a proliferative disadvantage. However, with clonal progression and unfavorable cytogenetic changes and/or a hypercellular marrow, where the malignant clone has a proliferative advantage, a higher dose regimen results in more reliable engraftment and eradication of the clone. Studies to identify the precise level of conditioning for the stages of the disease are ongoing. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
