    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3252 Poster Board III-1 A better understanding of the mechanisms which regulate drug resistance is critical for improving therapy for patients at risk of poor response. Even for CML patients the long-term benefits of the treatment are limited by the emergence of resistance, although the therapy has been dramatically improved by Imatinib Mesylate, which inhibits Bcr-Abl activity. One of the most important mechanisms of resistance is the disregulation of various members of the highly conserved family of transmembrane proteins characterized by an ATP-binding cassette domain, called ABC superfamily of transporters (Dean et al., Genome Res 2001). In CML cells an aberrant expression of ABC transporter genes has been described to be mediated by specific transcription factors, which are in turn affected by an aberrant activity of Bcr-Abl. It has been shown that Bcr-Abl can indirectly activate c-Myc via the JAK2 pathway, which increases a translation of c-Myc mRNA. In addition, in a subgroup of CML patients a chromosome 8 trysomy, has been observed, which can be associated with c-Myc amplification. In this study we have investigated whether c-Myc can regulate transcription of ABC tranporter genes in CML. Initially, ABC transporter gene expression has been monitored in HL60, a human promyelocytic cell line in which c-MYC is overexpressed. We have examined the expression level of all 48 human ABCs transporters as a function of c-MYC silencing. Our results have demonstrated that c-Myc regulates the transcription of several ABC genes, such as ABCA2, ABCB9, ABCB10, ABCC1, ABCC4, ABCE1, ABCF1, ABCF2, a majority of which has been found implicated in drug resistance. Furthermore, by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) we have shown a direct binding of c-Myc to the promoters of those ABC transporter genes in HL60 cell line. In addition, by ChIP we have demonstrated that c-MYC is physically bound to the promoter of tested ABC genes in CML cell lines KG-1a and K562. Based on those findings we have investigated the expression level of c-Myc in CD34+ progenitor cells derived from CML patients. Also, we have evaluated the effects of highly expressed c-Myc on ABC transporters. Our results have shown in a group of 20 newly diagnosed chronic phase (CP)-CML patients an increased expression of c-Myc in CD34+ cell fraction, when compared to the expression level of c-Myc in the entire population of mononuclear cells from which CD34+ cell fraction has been purified. In those cells we have identified in association with an increased level of c-Myc an increased expression of the same subset of ABC genes, which we have observed in cell lines. Furthermore, we have evaluated whether a differential expression of c-Myc and ABC transporter genes is associated with low Sokal risk and high Sokal risk patients. This analysis has been performed on CD34+ cells purified from 19 CML patients of whom 12 were scored as low Sokal risk and 7 as high Sokal risk. Our results have shown that expression of c-Myc and ABCC4 is different in those two patients population (p<0.05). Overall, our results highlight a novel aspect of the Bcr-Abl/c-Myc crosstalk with important implications on ABC genes upregulation in CML cells. These data suggest that inhibitors of Bcr-Abl, as exemplified by Gleevec may affect pathways involved in the regulation of drug resistance. To our knowledge this is the first identification of a small set of genes which reflect Sokal risk dichotomization, a key determinant of optimal and suboptimal response in CML patients.
