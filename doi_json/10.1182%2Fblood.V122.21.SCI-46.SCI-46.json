    "abstract_text": "The gene expression programs that establish and maintain specific cell states in humans are controlled by thousands of transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin regulators. Our understanding of the DNA elements and regulators that control gene expression programs has advanced considerably in the last year. I will describe new insights into the roles that these elements and regulators play in global gene control during normal development and in various diseases. These insights provide opportunities for the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics.
