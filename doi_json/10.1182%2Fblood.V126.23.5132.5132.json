    "abstract_text": "Introduction To study the expression of tumor associated macrophage (TAMs), inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 (interleukin-l\u03b2), TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1), IL-6 (interleukin 6) and IL-10 (interleukin 10) and its significance in different types of lymphoma in lymph node pathological tissue. Methods 106 cases of clinical pathology specimens of patients were collected from different types and different staging classifications. The expressions of tumor-associated macrophage and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor nec.rosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in lymphoma tissues were detected by immunohistochemical staining; Results Both CD68 and CSF-1R showed high expression in lymphoma tumor tissues. The positive rates of CD68 and CSF-1R in \u2163 period patients was higher than \u2161period ( P <0.05), and the level of CSF-1R in high-risk group was higher than low-risk group ( P <0.05). The expression of CD68 was positively correlated with CSF-1R. The inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10 were highly expressed in tumor tissues; the positive rate of IL-1\u03b2 in lymphoma IV period was higher than period\u2161( P <0.05) and the level of IL- 6 in high-risk group were significantly higher than the low-risk group ( P <0.05).The expression of tumor-associated macrophage phenotype CD68 in lymphoma tissues was positively correlated with inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 ( P <0.05). Conclusion 1.CD68, tumor-associated macrophage phenotype, and CSF-1R were highly expressed in lymphoma tissues 2.The expression of CD68 was positively correlated with inflammatory cytokines. 3.TAMs were involved in tumor inflammatory microenvironment.
