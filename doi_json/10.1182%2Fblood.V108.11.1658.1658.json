    "abstract_text": "The lymphatic system plays an important physiological role in vascular and immune homeostasis. Lymphatic vessel function is implicated in a number of pathological conditions including tumor metastasis and impaired wound healing. The identity and origin of lymphatic endothelial precursors is poorly understood. Previously we have shown that adult bone marrow-derived, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs, c-kit + , Sca-1 + , lineage \u2212 ) can differentiate into functional blood vascular endothelial cells. Given the close relationship between the blood and lymphatic vascular systems, we have investigated whether HSCs also give rise to lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC). GFP + HSCs were transplanted into lethally irradiated (1200 cGy) recipient mice. Donor-derived LEC expressing lymphatic endothelial markers including LYVE-1 and VEGFR3 were clearly distinguished from hematopoietic cells by the absence of CD45 and F4/80 expression. Deconvolution microscopy confirmed the co-localization of donor and LEC marker expression in individual cells. Transplanted HSCs gave rise to LEC in the liver, gut, gastric and kidney. Donor-derived LEC were detected in 2.4% of liver lymphatic vessels at 4 weeks and persisted for at least 12 months (mean of 3.4%). The self-renewal capacity of HSC-derived lymphatic progenitor cells was demonstrated by serial transplantation. The contribution of these progenitors to tumor lymphatics was evaluated. Transplantation of HSCs into young Min \u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in the incorporation of donor-derived LEC into the lymphatics of intestinal adenomas that spontaneously develop in these mice. In addition, CD45 + F4/80 + leukocytes were detected in the vessel lumens indicating that these are functional tumor lymphatic vessels. Finally, to determine if LEC progenitors contribute to lymphatic vessels in the absence of radiation injury or tumorigenesis, a parabiosis model was evaluated. Donor-derived LEC were detected in parabiotic mice at a frequency similar to that observed for donor-derived blood vascular endothelial cells. This finding suggests that circulating progenitor cells contribute to lymphangiogenesis during steady-state conditions. Our results indicate that hematopoietic stem cells have the potential to contribute to lymphatic endothelium and therefore HSC-derived progenitors may be potential therapeutic targets for hematopoietic and lymphatic disease.",
