    "abstract_text": "NPI-0052 is a novel proteasome inhibitor that produces prolonged inhibition of all three catalytic activities (C-L, T-L, CT-L) of the 20S proteasome. Preclinical data suggest NPI-0052 may demonstrate an improved therapeutic ratio, with activity in multiple myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia and solid tumor models. Phase 1 dose escalation studies are ongoing in patients with myeloma, lymphomas and solid tumors. Data from the Phase 1 study in patients with lymphomas or solid tumors are presented herein to examine the endpoints of pharmacodynamics (proteasome inhibition), pharmacokinetics and safety at doses below the MTD. Patients in this study were treated with NPI-0052 administered as a weekly IV bolus, for 3 weeks in 4-week cycles. The dose of NPI-0052 was escalated in cohorts of 3 patients dependent on observed adverse events utilizing a 3+3 design. In addition to weekly safety monitoring, proteasome inhibition and pharmacokinetics were assayed after the 1 st and 3 rd dose and with intrapatient dose escalations. Sixteen patients have been treated at doses ranging from 0.0125 mg/m 2 to 0.112 mg/m 2 for up to 7 cycles without reaching an MTD. Although, one SAE of MRSA sepsis and renal failure was reported at a dose of 0.1 mg/m 2 , drug related adverse events have not been reported at 0.112 mg/m 2 . Proteasome inhibition in whole blood has been assayed from 0.0125 mg/m 2 through 0.075 mg/m 2 , with results ranging from no inhibition to 63% inhibition of CT-L activity and indication of a correlation of inhibition with dose, inclusive of intrapatient dose increases. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data demonstrate a rapid elimination half-life (estimated to be 3\u20134 minutes) with clearance between 8\u201321 mL/min and Vz of 44\u201399L. No responses have been confirmed, however, 4 patients have had stable disease for 4 or more months, including patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (6 months), adenoid cystic carcinoma (4 months and 4 months), and cervical carcinoma [7 months with investigator reported complete resolution of target (lymph node) lesion(s) to palpation]. These data suggest that NPI-0052 is affecting parameters relevant to pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and potentially clinical benefit at doses below the MTD. Dose escalation continues to define a recommended phase 2 dose and further investigate the relevance of these outcomes in larger Recommended Phase 2 Dose Cohorts."
