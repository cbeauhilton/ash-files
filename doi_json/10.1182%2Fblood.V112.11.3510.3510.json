    "abstract_text": "TNF is a key cytokine in the effector phase of both graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the graft-versus leukemia (GVL) effect after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). TNF neutralizing antibodies are now established as effective therapeutic adjuncts for the treatment of severe acute GVHD. TNF signals through the p55 and p75 TNF receptors (TNFR), which are also receptors for the soluble lymphotoxin homotrimer (LT\u03b1 3 ). The membrane-bound lymphotoxin heterotrimeric molecule (LT\u03b1 1 \u03b2 2 ) signals through the LT\u03b2 receptor. The function of these molecules in GVHD remains unknown. Pharmacological agents are available which block either TNF alone, or both TNF and LT\u03b1 3 and elucidating the roles of these molecules in GVHD is essential for the design of rational therapeutic strategies. We have employed multiple well established preclinical models of GVHD to investigate the roles of these molecules. We first used a functional bioassay to confirm that a human TNFR:Fc construct was capable of preventing physiological activity of both recombinant murine TNF and LT\u03b1 3 . Irradiated B6D2F1 recipients were then transplanted with allogeneic B6.TNF \u2212/\u2212 bone marrow and T cells, then treated with control Ig or the TNFR:Fc. Suprisingly, the TNFR:Fc provided significant protection from GVHD mortality in the absence of donor derived TNF (median survival 25.5 vs 35 days, P 3 logs more LT\u03b1 than LT\u03b2). We subsequently developed the first reported ELISA to assess murine LT\u03b1 3 protein and were able to clearly demonstrate LT\u03b1 3 production by wild-type (WT) CD4 T cells seven days after BMT. To further examine this molecule, we performed experiments using WT, LT\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 or LT\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 donor grafts in two BMT systems (B6 \u2192 B6D2F1 and B6 \u2192 BALB/c). Recipients of LT\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 grafts were protected from GVHD ( P <0.01) in both systems while LT\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 grafts induced GVHD that was equivalent to, or more severe than in recipients of WT grafts. This data confirms soluble LT\u03b1 3 but not membrane bound LT\u03b1 1 \u03b2 2 as an additional pathogenic molecule in GVHD. Using a luciferase-expressing, host-type leukemia (P815) in the B6 \u2192 B6D2F1 system, relapse occurred at an identical rate in recipients of WT and LT\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 grafts confirming that GVL is maintained in the absence of donor derived soluble LT\u03b1 3 . Thus the combined neutralization of both LT\u03b1 3 and TNF represents an important and logical therapeutic intervention in transplant medicine."
