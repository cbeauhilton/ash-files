    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Selinexor is a novel, first-in-class selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE), which blocks XPO1, forcing the nuclear retention and activation of tumor suppressor proteins. Selinexor in combination with low dose dexamethasone (Sel-dex) was recently approved based on data from the STORM study, wherein Sel-dex induced an overall response rate (ORR) of 26.2% in patients with penta-exposed, triple-class refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of twice-weekly combination of selinexor, carfilzomib, and dexamethasone (SKd) was selinexor 60 mg, carfilzomib 20/27 mg/m 2 and dexamethasone 20 mg (NCT02199665). The ORR of this regimen in patients with MM refractory to carfilzomib in last line of therapy (n=13) was 62% and clinical benefit response was 77% (Jakubowiak et al. Br J Haematol 2019). This is consistent with data from the combination of selinexor, bortezomib and dexamethasone where a 43% ORR was observed in bortezomib refractory disease. We conducted the STOMP study to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of SKd combination using once weekly (QW) dosing in patients with relapsed/refractory MM. Methods: STOMP is a multicenter, open-label study. Patients with relapsed/refractory MM that was not refractory to carfilzomib, and who may have had prior proteasome inhibitor exposure were enrolled. Oral Selinexor was dosed QW at 80 or 100 mg. Carfilzomib was dosed QW (excluding day 22 of 28-day cycle) at 56 mg/m 2 or 70 mg/m 2 . Dexamethasone was dosed at 40 mg QW. The primary objectives of the study are to assess the maximum tolerated dose, RP2D and evaluate the efficacy and safety of SKd in patients with relapsed/refractory MM. Results: As of July 01 2019, 12 patients were enrolled in the study. Of these, 5 were male and 7 were female. The median age was 70 years (range: 50-76 years). The median number of prior treatments was 4 (range: 2 - 8). Nine of 12 patients received prior autologous stem cell transplantation. All 12 patients were carfilzomib na\u00efve. Nine of 12 patients had MM refractory to bortezomib; 11 patients had MM refractory to lenalidomide and/or pomalidomide including 5 patients with MM refractory to both; and 7 patients with MM refractory to daratumumab. Four dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed across 3 dose cohorts (Table 1). Common treatment related adverse events (Grade 1/2 , Grade \u22653) included anemia (42%, 17%), thrombocytopenia (17%, 58%), leukopenia (17%, 17%), nausea (67%, 0%), decreased appetite (33%, 0%), insomnia (33%, 0%), hyperglycemia (25%, 17%), fatigue (25%, 8%), vomiting (25%, 8%), and pneumonia (0%, 17%). The ORR was 75% including 3 complete responses, 5 very good partial responses and 1 partial response. Two patients had stable disease and 1 patient had minimal response. As of July 01, 8 patients remain on treatment. Conclusions: The once weekly SKd combination demonstrated encouraging preliminary activity with an ORR of 75% including complete responses and very good partial responses. Most DLTs were thrombocytopenia and all the DLT events occurred in patients with baseline Grade 1/2 thrombocytopenia. This activity and manageable side effect profile with QW selinexor in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone is promising.
