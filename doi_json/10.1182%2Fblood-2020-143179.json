    "abstract_text": "Megakaryocytes (MK) and platelets contain a high concentration of transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21). Mice with conditional deletion of Tgfb1 in megakaryocytes ( PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox ) resulted in >90% reduction of TGF\u03b21 in platelets and 50% reduction of TGF\u03b21 in plasma. TGF\u03b21 has been shown to play an inhibitory role in megakaryopoiesis in vitro, and inhibiting TGF\u03b21 increased megakaryopoiesis in vivo. However, the source of TGF\u03b21 in megakaryopoiesis is unknown. In this study, we tested whether megakaryocyte-derived TGF\u03b21 contributes to megakaryopoiesis in bone marrow (BM) by comparing three groups of mice: PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox , littermate control Tgfb1 flox/flox , and WT C57Bl/6 mice. Bones (femurs) from these mice (n=12) (age 15-30 weeks, males 60% and females 40%) were harvested, fixed, decalcified, sectioned, and H&E stained. Whole stained BM areas of the sectioned femurs were scanned with an Aperio slide scanner to quantify the number of megakaryocytes and the demarcation membrane system (DMS) and ploidy (nucleus size) of the megakaryocytes were quantified by manually counting megakaryocytes and tracing their DMS and nucleus. The percentage of MK among total BM cells was calculated by dividing total numbers of BM cells in the total area of a BM section with the number of MK in the section. Freshly isolated BM cells were cultured in vitro in culture medium (DMEM+10%FBS) in the presence of thrombopoietin (TPO, 100 ng/ml) with and without TGF\u03b21 (20 ng/ml) or with a neutralized antibody against the active form of TGF\u03b21 (AF-101; 2 ug/ml). TGF\u03b21 and TPO levels in plasma, BM exudates, and cells were measured by ELISA. PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox mice had >50% reduction in TGF\u03b21 levels in BM cells and exudates (TGF\u03b21 levels in BM exudates were 1.4 \u00b1 0.033 ng in WT and 0.68 \u00b1 0.065 ng in PF4CreTgfb1 flox/flox mice, p<0.01; and in BM cells 50 \u00b1 9 ng/ml in WT and 22 \u00b1 4.2 ng/ml in PF4CreTgfb1 flox/flox ; p<0.001). MK numbers were ~25% higher in PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox mice (n=6) compared to combined littermate controls (n=3) and WT (n=3) (MK was 0.30 \u00b1 0.02% in PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox and 0.23 \u00b1 0.16% in combined controls; p<0.001 (n=6), whereas blood platelet counts were only marginally higher in PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox (1114 \u00b1 300) vs. controls (806 \u00b1 116; p<0.05). There was a ~2-fold higher plasma TPO levels in PF4CreTgfb1 flox/flox mice vs. WT (p=0.04, n=4). Increased DMS and nucleus areas in MK have been shown to correlate with proplatelets formation and platelet production. However, DMS and nuclear areas remained unchanged between genotypes [(DMS area was 197 \u00b1 46 in PF4CreTgfb1 flox/flox and 228 \u00b1 50 um 2 in combined WT and littermate controls (p=0.3), and nucleus size was 154 \u00b1 23 in PF4CreTgfb1 flox/flox and 160 \u00b1 33 um 2 in controls (p=0.7)], indicating that the role of TGF\u03b21 is limited to megakaryopoiesis. To test whether the in vivo phenotype was recapitulated, we cultured whole BM isolated from WT and PF4Cre/Tgfb1 flox/flox mice, which showed a ~2.5-fold increase in MK numbers vs. WT when cultured for 5 days in TPO-supplemented medium. The addition of recombinant TGF\u03b21 in culture medium inhibited MK numbers, and a neutralizing antibody against TGF\u03b21 resulted in increased MK numbers. We conclude that MK-derived TGF\u03b21 negatively regulates megakaryopoiesis in mice. Further investigation is needed to determine the mechanism by which TGF\u03b21 regulates TPO-induced megakaryopoiesis. Our study may be important in megakaryocyte generation in vitro and may have important implications in vivo under normal and stress-inducing conditions where variable megakaryopoiesis is observed, such as essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis.
