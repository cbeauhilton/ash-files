    "abstract_text": "We aimed at understanding the relapse-driving processes in pediatric T-ALL and performed an integrated longitudinal multi-level omics analysis of 13 T-ALL patients at initial diagnosis (INI) and relapse (REL). We compared the mutation (SNV/InDels) and copy number alteration (CNA) patterns as well as gene expression, methylation levels and chromatin accessibility by ATAC-Seq. Aberrant expression of T-ALL transcription factors ( TAL1 , TAL2, LMO2 , TLX1 , TLX 3, NKX2.4 and NKX2.5 ) was preserved from initial presentation to relapse in all patients. These leukemia-driving events defined the expression patterns, methylation profiles and the chromatin accessibility landscapes. A global differential analysis of the RNA-Seq data (DESeq2, padj<.05) revealed only 0.3% of the genes to be either up- or down-regulated at relapse when compared to the matched initial sample. Likewise, we detected methylation changes in only 3% of the promoters and differential chromatin accessibility in only 0.26% of the analyzed ATAC-peaks (DESeq2, padj<.05). We then focused our analysis on the 2 types of relapse in pediatric T-ALL, which we have previously defined on the basis of subclonal mutation profiles (Kunz et al., 2015). These types of relapse are characterized by either clonal evolution of cells derived from the major clone at initial presentation (type 1) or emergence and evolution of a minor initial clone showing a molecular profile that is distinct from the predominant initial clone (type 2). When considering type 1 and type 2 relapses separately we identified a strong trend for type 2 relapses to acquire more mutations (p=0.0879, ttest) than type 1 relapses. Further to the known activating mutations in NT5C2 acquired at relapse by 8/13 patients no other mutations or CNAs were recurrently acquired in the relapses of this group of patients. However, mutations in proto-oncogenes or genes involved in DNA surveillance were acquired by 7/8 type 2 relapse patients in our series. Changes of CNAs also occurred more frequently in type 2 than in type 1 relapses (pval= 0.0267, ttest). This increased complexity on the genetic level was also apparent on the epigenetic level, with an increase of changes in the methylation pattern (mean difference in \u03b2 value between INI and REL: type 1 - 0.00034; type2 - 0.002 (pval< 0.0001, chi 2 )), chromatin accessibility (number of differentially accessible ATAC-peaks: type 1 - 4 (0.006%) ; type 2 - 1018 (1.3%); (pval< 0.0001, chi 2 )) and on the expression level (number of differentially expressed genes: type 1 - 11; type 2 - 111, pval<0.0001, chi 2 ). When considering differences between leukemias at the time of initial diagnosis, which later develop either type 1 or type 2 relapses we found 1.016 genes to be differentially expressed (524: up; 492: down in type 1; DE-Seq2: padj<0.05). Differential expression analysis revealed that genes involved in early T-cell differentiation were upregulated at initial diagnosis of type 1 in comparison to initial diagnosis of type 2, which was also reflected by more accessible chromatin surrounding their cis-regulatory regions as analyzed by ATAC-seq suggesting an early arrest of these samples during differentiation process. Altogether 1.4% of all ATAC-peaks were more accessible in type 1, whereas 0.7% of peaks were more accessible in type 2 leukemia (DE-Seq2: p<0.05). Remarkably, the chromatin surrounding DNA-repair genes was more accessible in initial leukemias of type 1, which was reflected by up-regulated mRNA expression level of such genes. These data suggest that an increased propensity of DNA repair may represent an important mechanism of T-ALL to develop a type 1 relapse, an interpretation that is consistent with previous reports linking the epigenetic silencing of the methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter with compromised DNA repair and longer survival in patients with glioblastoma receiving alkylating agents (Esteller et. al., 2000). In sum, the multilevel omic comparison of pediatric T-ALL that develop either a type 1 or a type 2 relapse show remarkably more complex changes of the genetic and epigenetic profiles during the transition from initial to relapsing disease. Notably, pediatric T-ALLs, who later develop a type 1 relapse display an epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape predicting an upregulation of DNA repair functions, which we suggest to potentially play a role in developing resistance to DNA damaging agents in this type of relapse.
