    "abstract_text": "Introduction: CMML is a heterogenous myeloid neoplasm with an estimated median overall survival (OS) of 31 months with 20% of patients transforming to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is subclassified by the WHO into CMML-0, CMML-1 and CMML-2 based upon bone marrow and peripheral blood blast percentage, with this distinction carrying variable prognostic relevance across published reports. CMML-2 is characterized by 10-19% bone marrow myeloblasts and/or 5-19% peripheral blood myeloblasts. However, whether this represents a distinct clinical entity or a transitional state inevitably leading to AML has not been explored. Methods: CMML patients with baseline disease classification and detailed treatment information were identified from the Moffitt Cancer Center CMML database. Baseline demographic, clinical and molecular information was evaluated. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine OS, progression free survival (PFS) and AML transit time, defined as the time from diagnosis to AML transformation. Treatment na\u00efve patients with a baseline diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts-2 (MDS-EB2) were identified from an existing MDS clinical database as a comparator. Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism and SPSS. Results: Between 1/1/2000 and 7/1/2019, 623 patients with a pathologic diagnosis of CMML were identified. The median age was 71 and 68.4% were male. At the time of diagnosis, 356 patients were classified as CMML-0, 156 as CMML-1 and 111 as CMML-2. Median OS was calculated after stratifying patients by WHO category identifying 3 distinct prognostic groups with a median OS of 40 months in CMML-0, 22.4 months in CMML-1 and 14.0 months in CMML-2 (p2 vs 5.2%, p=0.08) and demonstrated a dismal median OS of 1.9 months. Untreated patients with CMML-2 were then compared to 85 patients with MDS-EB2 who did not receive therapy. While no significant difference in OS was identified, CMML-2 patients had a significantly higher rate of transformation to AML (66.3% vs. 22.3%, p<0.0001) and inferior PFS (2.8 vs. 5.1 months, p=0.0008). Conclusion: Subclassification of CMML by the WHO system based on bone marrow and peripheral blood blast content effectively stratifies patients into three groups with a distinct risk of AML transformation, PFS, and OS. Untreated CMML-2 patients display a rapid and extremely high rate of transformation supporting a transitional phase to AML. Further, the majority of untreated CMML-2 patients that did not pathologically transform had a particularly poor prognosis clinically consistent with aggressive AML. This is distinct from patients with MDS-EB2 in whom the risk of AML transformation and PFS were far lower. HMA effectively reduced the risk of AML transformation, PFS, and significantly delayed transit time to AML.
