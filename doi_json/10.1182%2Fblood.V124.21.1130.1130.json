    "abstract_text": "Clinical scale depletion of CD45RA+ na\u00efve T cells from leukapheresis collections can be achieved using CliniMACS (Bone Marrow Transplant. 2013, 1-7). In this study, PBSC collections depleted of CD45RA+ cells were infused as part of CT treatment protocols for pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors in 2 separate clinical trials. Between Sep 2012 and May 2014, a total of 25 CD45RA+ cell depletion procedures was performed for 25 patients. Mobilized PBSC leukapheresis units were collected (using Spectra) from HLA haplo-identical donors and held overnight in cold prior to cell selection. Characterization of the products before and after CD45RA+ cell depletion is shown in Table 1. Depletion of all CD45RA+ cell averaged to 3.39-log while depletion of CD3+CD45RA+ T cells was > 3.76-log, as this subset of cells became undetectable in 8 (out of 25) final products. CD34+ cell recovery was 65.4%, similar to that of CD3+CD45RO+ T cells (65.1%), which constituted > 99% of all T cells after depletion. From the PBSC collection, each patient received a median dose of 0.009 x 10 6 CD3+CD45RA+ cells/kg and 11.1 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg. The final product contained a substantial amount of CD14+ monocytes (median = 22.0%, range: 7.0 \u2013 46.4), few CD56+ NK cells (3.1%, range: 1.3 \u2013 8.1) and almost no CD19+ B cells (0.04%, range: 0.01 \u2013 0.30). After processing the cells were resuspended in Plasmalyte + 5% human serum albumin and infused as soon as possible. There was no reported contamination (growth of bacteria \u2013 aerobic or anaerobic and fungus) in the final cell products and no infusion related adverse events were observed. In conclusion, we have demonstrated clinical scale depletion of na\u00efve T cells can be achieved consistently and the final cell product can be safely infused into patients as part of HSCT and / or CT program.
