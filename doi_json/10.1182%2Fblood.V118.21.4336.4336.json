    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4336 Background Despite the improvements and promises of novel agents (demethylating and erythropoiesis stimulating agents), red blood cells (RBC) and platelets transfusion remains frequent and essential in the management of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Reducing patients\u2019 dependence to transfusion is a major outcome, linked with the disease prognosis, patients\u2019 quality of life and economical issues. Few data in the literature have described transfusions practices and requirements in MDS patients. We report here an epidemiological study of the transfusion practices in our center and try to build an economical evaluation of direct transfusions costs. Design and Methods We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study including all new patients diagnosed with MDS in the department of haematology of Besan\u25a1 on between 2006 and 2009. Patients were classified as high risk (HR) MDS when IPSS was \u2265 1.5, and as low risk (LR) when IPSS was \u2264 1. We compared HR and LR groups and four categories of age (\u226468; [68\u201376]; [76\u201383] and >83 years) according to transfusion data. The economic study compared direct costs of RBC transfusions and erythroipoiesis-stimulating agents for LR and HR patients, including the costs of hospital stays. Materials, transport, medical examinations, doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 wages and iron chelation were not considered in this analysis. T-test and \u03c7 2 -test were used for comparisons. Results 205 patients were analysed, median age at diagnosis was 74.3 years ( table 1 ), with a predominance of men (sex ratio 1.33). IPSS score was available for 75% of patients (n=154), 111 LR patients and 43 HR patients. Median follow-up was 32 months [10\u201357]. Twenty-three patients (11%) developed a secondary acute leukaemia and 11 (5%) received allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Table 1. Patient characteristics  Parameters . Number of patients (%) .

Platelets level was lower in the HR vs LR (109 vs. 178 G/L respectively, p<0.0001). 60.5% of patients (n=124/205) received labile blood products during the follow-up, more frequently RBC than platelets (87.5% vs. 12.5% respectively). The mean Hb threshold at transfusion was 8.1 g/dl without any significant difference between neither age groups nor IPSS; age did not influenced transfusion requirement ( Table 2 ). In comparison to HR patients, LR patients were less transfused (55 vs. 79%, p<0.006, table 2 ), and had longer mean intervals between transfusions (32.5 vs. 16.9 days, p<0.001). Furthermore, a progressive shortening of transfusion intervals was observed for both groups along the time; this progression was faster for HR patients. The anti-erythrocyte immunization rates, excluding anti-RH or anti-Kell, was 6.7%. Table 2. Use of transfusion according to IPSS and age  Use of transfusion(RBC and/or platelets) . Yes . No . p .

Conclusion In our study, neither transfusion requirement nor transfusion threshold were correlated with age, whereas both were affected by IPSS. Furthermore, age did not appear to be a predictive factor concerning the transfusion dependence. Despite its limits, the economic study reveals that EPO and transfusion's annual costs are similar in low risk patients. Updated data will be presented on EPO and 5-azacytidine use in our cohort to assess their impact on transfusion practices. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
