    "abstract_text": "Background: Human follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are the most common forms of indolent and aggressive NHL, respectively. The t(14;18) translocation characterizes approximately 85% of FL and 20% of DLBCL and results in constitutive overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2. It was previously reported that BCL-2 plays dual roles in preventing apoptosis and autophagy. Autophagy is a physical and pathological process whereby cells sequester portions of cytoplasm including organelles to form autophagosomes where they are degraded and recycled. Growing evidence demonstrates that autophagy plays important roles in tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and resistance to chemotherapy. Aims: The autophagy status in human B-cell lymphomas is unknown. We hypothesized that overexpression of BCL-2 could change autophagy status and aimed to determined expression of autophagy-related genes and proteins in FL and DLBCL primary samples by PCR array and tissue microarray. We aimed to evaluate whether expression of the autophagy-related proteins p62, Beclin-1 and LC3 individually and in combination with BCL-2 protein expression could risk-stratify FL and DLBCL patients at diagnosis. Patients and methods: Using PCR array, the autophagy-related gene expression profiles were determined in purified and unpurified reactive and malignant human lymph node tissue biopsies. Diagnostic tissues from FL (n=117) and DLBCL (n=109) patients were microarrayed and autophagy protein expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Univariate and multivariate analyses on both continuous and categorical variables were conducted to measure overall survival (OS), disease specific survival (DSS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Seven autophagy machinery genes were up-regulated in purified FL B-cells, namely ATG9A , ATG16L1 , MAP1LC3A , GABARAPL1 , ULK1 , LAMP1 and HDAC6 compared with reactive B-cells. Two autophagy machinery genes, MAP1LC3A and DRAM1 , were up-regulated in DLBCL B-cells. In unpurified tissue biopsies, 20 of 46 genes in FL and 2 of 5 genes in DLBCL with increased expression were autophagy machinery genes. CTSD (cathepsin D) and TGM2 (transglutaminase 2) genes and proteins were mainly up-regulated in DLBCL tumor-infiltrating macrophages. These results demonstrate that FL and DLBCL showed increased expression of autophagy-related genes, regardless of the heterogeneity of these diseases. p62, a selective autophagy substrate; LC3, an autophagosome membrane protein; and Beclin-1, an essential autophagy effector, are often used to evaluate autophagy activity in the cell. 91% FL samples were BCL-2 positive but significantly decreased expression of p62, LC3 and Beclin-1 in FL samples was observed in both intra-follicular and non-malignant inter-follicular areas. This suggests that increased basal autophagy activity in both malignant FL cells and surrounding tumor infiltrating cells, indicating that BCL-2 does not inhibit basal autophagy activity. DLBCL samples displayed heterogeneous expression patterns of BCL-2, p62, LC3 and Beclin-1. We found that decreased p62 expression confers worse OS (continuous P=0.015; and categorical P=0.003), DSS (continuous P=0.037; categorical P=0.014) and PFS (categorical P=0.002) in DLBCL patients. Decreased expression of Beclin-1 was also confers poor prognosis in both FL and DLBCL as conducted by categorical analysis, OS (DLBCL, P=0.015; FL, P=0.004), DSS (FL, P=0.006), and PFS (DLBCL, P=0.029). p62 retains prognostic significance after adjustment for the International Prognostic Index (IPI) score and levels of BCL-2, Beclin-1 and LC3 in multivariate analysis. Beclin-1 retains its prognostic significance in FL after adjusting for FLIPI scores. Low p62 plus high BCL-2 expression in DLBCL confers the worst OS (P<0.0001) and DSS (P=0.001) compared with other combinations. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that FL has increased basal autophagy activity, while it varies in DLBCL. p62 is a novel, independent prognostic biomarker for DLBCL but not for FL. Combining p62 with BCL-2 provides a more robust and reliable method to risk-stratify DLBCL patients at diagnosis. Importantly, we report for the first time that overexpression of BCL-2 in human NHL does not inhibit basal autophagy activity. We propose that increased autophagy activity could be a therapeutic target for treatment of NHL. Disclosures Gribben: Celgene: Research Funding; Pharmacyclics: Honoraria; Roche: Honoraria.",
