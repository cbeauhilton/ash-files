    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Bortezomib (Velcade \u00a8 ; V), a proteasome inhibitor, is currently FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) and relapsed mantle cell lymphoma. Common side effects reported with its use include thrombocytopenia, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy and neutropenia. Ocular complications associated with bortezomib are less well described. We describe 6 patients with multiple myeloma who developed meibomitis, multiple chalazions and blepharitis after treatment with bortezomib containing regimens, resulting in delay and in some cases termination of the therapy. Methods: We reviewed the charts of forty patients who received induction chemotherapy for multiple myeloma between June 2013-June 2014 at Montefiore Medical Center, New York. Charts were reviewed for data pertaining to demographics, chemotherapy regimen and schedule as well as follow up of ocular symptoms. Results: Six of these forty (15%) patients complained about bilateral eye soreness, itching and redness. They did not have any evidence of viral or upper respiratory infections. Ophthalmology evaluation showed blepharitis, meibomitis and multiple chalazion. Majority of the patients were 60 years or greater, with 50% African-Americans. Half of the cases had stage 3 MM with a median duration of chemotherapy 8 weeks prior to onset of ocular symptoms. 4 of these 6 patients received VCD regimen (Bortezomib via subcutaneous route and Cyclophosphamide/ Dexamethasone as tablets) while the remaining 2 patients received VD and VCD-R (addition of Lenalidomide) via intravenous and subcutaneous route respectively. Ocular symptoms led to a 1-3 week delay in the next cycle of chemotherapy. These symptoms promptly responded to withdrawal of chemotherapy and other conservative measures. Chemotherapy was resumed in 4 out of 6 patients, with recurrence of chalazion in two patients within 3 weeks of starting Bortezomib. Conclusions: Ocular symptoms are commonly seen but rarely reported with bortezomib therapy. They can adversely affect patient's quality of life as well as lead to interruption in chemotherapy. Although these symptoms respond well to withdrawal of chemotherapy and conservative measures, the rate of recurrence is high once bortezomib is resumed. Awareness of these complications and early intervention can potentially avoid treatment delay.
