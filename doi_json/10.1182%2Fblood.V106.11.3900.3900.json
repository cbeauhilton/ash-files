    "abstract_text": "The admission of neutropenic patients (pts) to intensive care units (ICU) is controversial, especially when mechanical ventilation is required. Knowledge of the relative prognostic impact of factors related to the underlying disease and to the severity of acute organ failures might help avoiding futile admissions. We retrospectively assessed predictors of 30-day mortality in neutropenic (500/ul). Pts who died were more likely to have non-M3 AL subtype vs M3 (p=0.037), to have \u2265 2 acute OSF vs < 2 (p=0.012) and a higher SAPS II score (p< 0.001). In multivariate analysis only the latter 2 variables remained significant. In conclusion, our data show that 27% of neutropenic pts admitted to ICUs are alive at 30 days; that selection for admission should not be based on the characteristics of the underlying malignancy; and that the 30-day mortality is highly predictable by initial acute illness severity scores.",
