    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3521 Background Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) accounts for approximately 5% of all acute myeloid leukemias (AML). The characteristic molecular feature of APL is a fusion product named PML-RARA which acts as transcriptional repressor that affects gene expression patterns involved in differentiation, apoptosis, and self-renewal. The internal tandem duplication of the Fms-related Tyrosine-like Kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) confers a poor prognosis in non-APL AML, however its effect in APL is still under discussion as several investigators found no prognostic influence for FLT3-ITD in APL. Aberrant DNA-promotor-methylation of tumor suppressor genes contributes significantly to leukemogenesis and oncogenic transformation. Deneberg et al. recently identified characteristic methylation profiles for cytogenetically normal AML, however no specific methylation profile was associated with FLT3-ITD in a study that excluded APL. To further elucidate the influence of aberrant methylation in FLT3-positive APL we carried out a genome wide DNA methylation analysis on APL samples with and without FLT3-ITD. Methods In total, genomic DNA from blasts of 54 APL patients at initial diagnosis (bone marrow n=32, peripheral blood n=22) were analyzed (median age 46 years, gender: 35 female, 19 male, blast count median 80%). The molecular analysis was carried out with written informed consent, with permission of the institutional review board and in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. DNA was extracted using the QIAGEN Allprep Kit\u00ae (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Genome wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Differential methylation of CpGs was defined by a minimum mean methylation difference of 25% as expressed by the beta-value of the array data and statistical significance set at q \u2264 0.01 according to the Benjamini-Hochberg-method for multiple significance testing. Analysis of array data was performed using Genome-Studio Software\u00ae (Illumina, San Diego, USA), Qlucore Omics explorer 2.3 (Qlucore software. Lund, Sweden) and Microsoft Excel 10.1\u00ae (Microsoft Software, Redmond, USA). Pyrosequencing was performed to validate methylation changes as detected by the array-based analysis. Results The methylation pattern of FLT3-ITD-positive APL (n=18) patients was analyzed and compared to patients without FLT3-ITD (n=32) or D835 Mutation (n=4). We identified 133 CpGs that were significantly differentially methylated in FLT3-ITD-positive APL as compared to FLT3-ITD-negative APL. The most significant differential methylation was observed for 5 CpGs showing a strong hypomethylation of the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 6 ( CCR6 ) in FLT3-ITD-APL as compared to FLT3-negative APL (q-value < 6.9 *10 \u221213 ). Other interesting target genes showing pronounced hypomethylation in FLT3-ITD positive APL samples belonged to the family of phosphatases such as the dual specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5), protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, N polypeptide 2 (PTPRN2) and protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor-type, Z polypeptide 1 (PTPRZ1). The most prominent hypermethylation in FLT3-ITD APL was observed in CpGs within the coding region of suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 ( SOCS2 ) and significantly discriminated between FLT3-ITD and FLT3-negative APL (q-value < 10 \u22125 ). The results of the genome-wide analysis obtained with the Illumina 450K BeadChip were validated for 4 CPGs in 10 samples via pyrosequencing and showed a robust Pearson correlation of 0.92 suggesting a good and reliable performance of the Illumina 450 K Bead Chip Assay. Conclusions The current study represents a comprehensive genome wide methylation analysis of a clinically well-defined cohort of APL patients. We here demonstrate for the first time that in contrast to cytogenetically normal AML, APL patients with FLT3-ITDs display a highly specific and disease defining DNA methylation profile. Thereby key regulators of cellular growth signaling such as SOC2, PTPRN2 and DUSP5 are significantly differentially methylated in dependency of FLT3-ITD status. This suggests that a cooperative effect between PML-RARA and FLT3-ITD is mediated by dysregulation of DNA methylation. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
