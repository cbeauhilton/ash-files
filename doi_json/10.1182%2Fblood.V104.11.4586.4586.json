    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND : For more than 20 years, CHOP has been the gold standard treatment for patients with aggressive NHL. The addition of rituximab to this regimen has been shown to improve outcomes in elderly patients with advanced ( Coiffier et al NEJM  2002 ; 346 : 235 \u201342 ). However, CHOP is often poorly tolerated by elderly patients resulting in dose reductions and consequently lower response and cure rates compared to younger patients. Myocet\u2122 (non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) has an improved pharmacokinetic profile with less myelosuppression and GI toxicity and has a reduced risk of cardiotoxicity at dose levels equivalent to standard formulations of doxorubicin. METHODS : In this phase II, open label, 2-stage study, we replaced the conventional doxorubicin with Myocet\u2122 to evaluate the response rate and safety of the R-COMP regimen (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Myocet\u2122, prednisone). Previously untreated, elderly patients (\u226560 yrs) with CD20+ newly diagnosed, advanced DLBCL were treated every 3 weeks with: Myocet\u2122 50mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide 750mg/m 2 , vincristine 1.4 mg/m 2 (max. 2mg), rituximab 375 mg/m 2 (day 3 on cycle 1, day 1 thereafter) and prednisone 100mg/d d1\u20135 for 8 cycles. Response was assessed after 3 and 8 cycles. RESULTS : Thirty patients were enrolled in stage 1 of the study with a median age of 72 (range 61\u201382). At baseline 17 (56%) patients had stage III\u2013IV disease; 60% had an intermediate or high risk (2+) International Prognostic Index score and the median LVEF was 59% (range 50\u201375). A total of 198 cycles of chemotherapy were given, with a median of 8 cycles (range 1\u20138). Of the 198 cycles administered 15 (8%) were delayed by haematological or hepatic toxicity for a median of 7 days (range 0 to 25). The relative dose intensity for the regimen was 87%, for Myocet\u2122 it was 84%. Toxicity was mainly haematological with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in 29% of cycles and febrile neutropenia in 4%. There was no grade 3 or 4 vomiting and a low incidence of grade 1 or 2 vomiting (3%). At the last observation the median LVEF was 55% (range 40\u201376), 16 patients had no change or an improved LVEF and 13 patients had a reduced LVEF. In the cohort of 24 patients evaluable for response, 15 (63%) had a complete response and an additional 7 (29%) achieved a partial response. CONCLUSIONS : These interim results suggest R-COMP is a well tolerated regimen with promising response rates in elderly patients with advanced DLBCL. Patient recruitment continues in stage 2 of the study with the aim of enrolling a total of 75 patients with a 2-year follow-up.",
