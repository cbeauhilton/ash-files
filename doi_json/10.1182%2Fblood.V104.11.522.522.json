    "abstract_text": "In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), early response to therapy is of crucial prognostic significance. In the frontline ALL-BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Mu\u0308nster) trial, treatment stratification is based on blast count estimation in peripheral blood at day 8 of induction prephase with prednisone and one dose of intrathecal methotrexate at day 1. To approach yet unknown mechanisms of therapy resistance and to characterize cells persisting under therapy on molecular level, we investigated gene expression profiles of leukemic blasts at day 8 of therapy (\u201cday 8\u201d cells) and their changes as compared with blast cells at initial diagnosis (\u201cday 0\u201d cells). To this end, an experimental procedure has been established including flow sorting of leukemic cells by their leukemia-associated immunophenotype and preparation of cRNA, starting from a small number of cells and using an additional amplification step. Experiments have shown that flow sorting procedure does not affect RNA quality, and this experimental approach facilitates investigation of patient samples with blast cell counts as low as 50 blast cells/\u03bcl. Blast cells from ten patients with B-cell precursor ALL were investigated using Affymetrix HG U133A microarrays, and gene expression data were processed by normalization procedure on probe level by variance stabilization. Genes commonly up- or downregulated in blast cells under therapy were identified in matched pairs of day 8 and day 0 samples using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and a filtering criterion of at least two-fold mean change. By this procedure a group of 84 genes with a false discovery rate of less than 10 % was identified. In this group, 24 genes, reportedly involved at different levels of the cell cycle regulation, including cell cycle progression (CDC2, cyclin B2), DNA replication (e.g. thymidylate synthetase TYMS, ribonucleotide reductase RRM2, proteins MCM 4 and 6) and execution of mitosis (e.g. cell cycle checkpoint kinases CHEK1 and BUB1B, kinesin-like proteins 1 and 7, and MAD2L1), were found to be downregulated in the day 8 cells. In contrast, genes (n=7) encoding for proteins involved in survival signaling (e.g. IL-4/IL-13 common receptor chain, membrane-spanning 4-domains MS4A1 and CD20) showed increased expression in day 8 blasts. Taken together, the described experimental approach enabled gene expression analysis of ALL cells persisting under therapy and pointed to increased survival signaling in day 8 blasts and their preferential positioning in the G1 cell cycle phase."
