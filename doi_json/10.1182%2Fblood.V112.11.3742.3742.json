    "abstract_text": "The majority of anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) are characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35) leading to the expression of NPM/ALK. The constitutive activation of the NPM/ALK tyrosine kinase induces downstream mediators such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)/AKT, JAK3 and STAT3 that result in increased cell proliferation and enhanced survival. Although the molecular mechanism by which these pathways deregulate the cell cycle machinery is not fully understood, previous studies have shown that NPM/ALK-mediated PI3K/AKT activation is required for cell cycle progression and that inhibition of PI3K/AKT results in decreased p27Kip1 degradation and cell cycle arrest. The expression of S-phase kinase protein 2 (SKP2), an F-box motif-containing protein which targets cell cycle regulators including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 via ubiquitin-mediated degradation, was evaluated in a panel of ALCL cell lines. Western blot analysis of five t(2;5)-positive ALCL-derived cell lines demonstrated an inverse pattern of expression between F-box protein SKP2 and p27Kip1. We hypothesized that SKP2 deregulation contributes to the oncogenic activity of NPM/ALK by regulating the degradation of p27Kip1. In this study we investigated regulation of SKP2 and p27Kip1 expression as a consequence of inhibition of two well-known pathways downstream of NPM/ALK. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT with Ly294002 (20 mM) or JAK3 with WHI-P154 (10 mM) resulted in a dose and time-dependent decrease in cell viability (50% or 20% respectively at 24h). To determine the mechanism of SKP2 transcriptional regulation by PI3K, we performed quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis which demonstrated a decrease in both SKP2 transcript and protein levels after PI3K/AKT and JAK2 inhibition (33% or 47% at 24h respectively), with increase in the levels of p27 transcript and protein (47% or 71% at 24h respectively). Furthermore, the levels of E2F1 (a transcription factor associated with cell cycle progression) also decreased upon PI3K/AKT and JAK3 inhibition. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that E2F1 binding to the SKP2 gene promoter was reduced as early as 4 hours after inhibition of PI3K/AKT or JAK3 (80% and 59% respectively) while no binding was detected with the GAPDH gene promoter (control). In conclusion, these results indicate that the expression of the F-box protein SKP2 is regulated by NPM/ALK mediators, PI3K/AKT and JAK3, and that E2F1 mediates the transcriptional control of SKP2 expression. Our data supports the role of SKP2\u2013mediated regulation of p27Kip1 in ALCLs and implicates SKP2 and E2F1 as a potential therapeutic target in ALCLs.",
