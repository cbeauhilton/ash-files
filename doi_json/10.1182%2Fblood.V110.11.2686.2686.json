    "abstract_text": "Factor VIIIa acts as an essential cofactor for the serine protease factor IXa, together forming the Xase complex which catalyzes the conversion of factor X to factor Xa. The procofactor, factor VIII circulates as a heterodimeric protein comprised of a heavy chain (A1\u2013A2-B domains) and a light chain (A3-C1-C2 domains) and is activated by proteolytic cleavage by thrombin at Arg372 (A1\u2013A2 junction), Arg740 (A2-B junction), and Arg1689 (near the N-terminus of A3). The regions adjacent to the A1, A2, and A3 domains contain high concentrations of acidic residues and are designated a1 (residues 337\u2013372), a2 (residues 711\u2013740), and a3 (residues 1649\u20131689). In addition, the N-terminus of the A2 domain (residues 373\u2013395) is rich in acidic residues, and results from a previous study revealed that this region contributes to the rate of thrombin-catalyzed cleavage at Arg740 ( Nogami et. al., J. Biol. Chem . 280 : 18476 , 2005 ). In this study we reveal a role for the acidic region following the A2 domain (a2, residues 717\u2013725) in thrombin-catalyzed cleavage at both Arg372 and Arg1689. The factor VIII mutations Asp717Ala, Glu720Ala, Asp721Ala, Glu724Ala, Asp725Ala, and the double mutations of Glu720Ala/Asp721Ala and Glu724Ala/Asp725Ala were constructed, expressed, and purified from stably-transfected BHK cells as B-domainless protein. Specific activity values for the variants, relative to the wild type value were reduced to 70% for Asp717Ala; \u223c50% for Glu720Ala, Asp721Ala, Glu724Ala, and Asp725Ala; and \u223c30% for Glu720Ala/Asp721Ala and Glu724Ala/Asp725Ala. SDS-PAGE and western blotting of reactions containing the factor VIII variants and thrombin showed reductions in the rates of thrombin cleavage at both Arg372 and Arg1689 as compared to wild-type factor VIII. The cleavage rates for the single mutations comprising acidic residues 720\u2013724 of factor VIII were reduced from \u223c3-5-fold at Arg372, whereas this rate for the Asp717Ala mutant was similar to the wild-type value. The double mutations of Glu720Ala/Asp721Ala and Glu724Ala/Asp725Ala showed rate reductions of \u223c7- and \u223c27-fold, respectively at Arg372. While the rate for thrombin-catalyzed cleavage at Arg1689 in the Glu720Ala variant was similar to wild-type, rates for cleavage at this site were reduced \u223c30-fold compared to wild-type factor VIII for the Asp721Ala, Glu724Ala, Asp725Ala, and Glu720Ala/Asp721Ala mutants, and \u223c50-fold for the Glu724Ala/Asp725Ala variant. Furthermore, the generation of factor VIIIa activity following reaction with thrombin as assayed by factor Xa generation showed that all the mutants possessed peak activity values that were \u223c2-3-fold reduced compared to wild type factor VIIIa. Moreover, in all the mutants the characteristic peak of activation was replaced with a slower forming, broad plateau of activity, with the double mutants showing the broadest activation profiles. These results suggest that residues Glu720, Asp721, Glu724, and Asp725 following the A2 domain modulate thrombin interactions with factor VIII facilitating cleavage at Arg372 and Arg1689 during procofactor activation.",
