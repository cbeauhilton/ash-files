    "abstract_text": "Background Systemic inflammatory factors such as C-reactive protein (CRP), \u00a5\u00e22-microglobulin (B2MG), and ferritin were documented an prognostic factor in patients with hematologic malignancies including lymphoma. The purpose of this study was to find the significance of systemic inflammatory factors for predicting survival outcome in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Methods A total of 188 patients who newly diagnosed DLBCL and received an rituximab combined chemotherapy at the South Korea between September 2004 and April 2012 were enrolled retrospectively in the current study. Pretreatment serum CRP, B2MG, and ferritin were measured within 4 weeks before the beginning of first line chemotherapy. Results The median age of patients was 58 years (range, 14-84 years) and the mean level of serum CRP, B2MG, and ferritin at pre-treatment were 2.37 mg/dL (range: 0.01 \u2013 29.80), 2.64 mg/L (range: 0.71 \u2013 24.01), and 285.01 ng/ml (range: 5.34-4872.40). Systemic inflammatory factors score were given 1 point if serum levels were more than normal range (CRP; 0.8 mg/dL, B2MG; 2.5 mg/L and ferritin; 220 ng/ml). Systemic inflammatory risk were divided into three groups according to systemic inflammatory factors scores ; low risk was 0 score, intermediate risk was 1 or 2 score, and high risk was 3 score respectively. 5-year progression free survival rates (PFS) were 66.9%, 65.0% and 10.6% in risk groups respectively (p < 0.001). 5-year overall survival rates (OS) were 74.4%, 48.8% and 19.8% in risk groups respectively (p < 0.001). Conclusions Systemic inflammatory factor (CRP, B2MG and ferritin) score were associated with survival outcomes in patients with DLBCL treated by R-CHOP. However, further studies are needed to confirm prognostic value of systemic factors such as CRP, B2MG and ferritin. Table 1 Patient characteristics Value (%) . N = 188 .
