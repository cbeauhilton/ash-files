    "abstract_text": "Background: The beginnings of pediatric oncology in Bydgoszcz, Poland dates back to the year 1958. The first patient was treated with prednisolone only. Objective: Analysis of results of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy in Bydgoszcz region in 1958\u20132008. Patients and methods: A total number of 570 children were diagnosed and treated over the period of 50 years, including: 215 children treated with different drugs and combinations in 1958\u20131972, 49 children treated with Memphis V\u2013VII protocols in 1976\u20131983, 114 children treated with ALL-BFM83 or ALL-BFM86 protocols in 1983\u2013 1995 and 192 children treated with ALL-BFM90, New York I\u2013II or ALL-IC-2002 between 1995\u20132008. Results: A number of patients with \u201eevents\u201d in respective time periods was: 205/215 (95.3%, in 1958\u20131972); 44/49 (89.8%, in 1976\u20131983), 54/114 (47.4%, in 1983\u20131995), 56/192 (29.2%, in 1995\u20132008). The values of 5-year pEFS in consecutive therapeutic periods were: p=0.012\u00b10.008 (1958\u20131972), p=0.102\u00b10.043 (in 1976\u20131983), p=0.526\u00b10.047 (in 1983\u20131995), p=0.700\u00b10.037 (in 1995\u20132008) (p<0.0001). A median survival time was, respectively: 0.8 year (for patients treated in 1958\u20131972); 1.8 year (in1976\u20131983); 5.7 years (in 1983\u20131995); 7.4 years (for patients treated in 1995\u20132008). Conclusions: Complex therapy based on international strategy of multiagent total therapy and supportive care, has led to an improved long-term survival in childhood ALL in Bydgoszcz region, Poland, from 1% in sixties up to 70% nowadays Figure 1.
