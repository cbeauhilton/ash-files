    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4903 Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) accounts for approximately 10% of the childhood lymphomas. ALCL is characterized by peripheral, mediastinal or intra-abdominal lymph node involvement or extranodal involvement. We report a child with ALCL with unusual localization. An eleven-year-old boy had been admitted to the another university hospital with left knee pain and swelling for 15 days. The left knee joint punction had been done, and osteomyelitis had been diagnosed, and treated with antibiotics. However, there had been no recovery from his complaints, and left knee synoviectomy had been done. This operation had revealed anaplastic large cell lymphoma in the intraarticular soft tissue of the left knee. Then, he was referred to our hematology and oncology clinic for advanced therapy. There was nothing significant in the background and family history. Physical examination showed a 3 cm mass arising from the left knee joint with lobulated contours. PET-CT showed the left inguinal lymph node involvement, only. Chemotherapy according to ALCL 99 protocol was started because of the tumor was not resectable. After the first course of therapy, tumor mass was reduced apparently. By the end of his second chemotherapy course, tumor was not detectable. Now, he completed his therapy, and he is on follow-up without any complaint or recurrence for 18 months. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case with ALCL originating from the intraarticular soft tissue which was treated successfully.
