    "abstract_text": "Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug that is FDA approved for treatment of 5q- myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloma. It has also been tested as a salvage therapy of refractory/relapsed AML with encouraging activity, especially in patients (pts) who relapsed post allogeneic transplant (alloSCT). In this setting, it has been postulated that lenalidomide may re-activate donor immune system and enhance a graft-versus-leukemia effect. This hypothesis is also supported by evidence of increase graft-versus-disease (GVHD) observed in pts treated with lenalidomide post-alloSCT. Therefore, in order to prospectively study the safety, feasibility, and early impact on risk of disease relapse we performed a phase 1 dose escalation study of lenalidomide administered orally daily following reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) alloSCT in pts with leukemia and lymphoma eligible for transplant. Methods: Pts were enrolled on a two-step process, with initial enrollment prior to transplant followed by a re-registration evaluation post-transplant at day +60 (+/- 7 days) to ensure eligibility. At this screening, pts were required to demonstrate engraftment with ANC >1000/uL, platelet count \u00b350,000/uL, and T-cell chimerism \u00b340% by day +30. Pts were required to have a creatinine clearance \u00b350 mL/min, AST \u00b23 x ULN, and ECOG PS of 0-2. Grades 1 or 2 acute GVHD (aGVHD) were allowed if controlled on \u00b2 20 mg of prednisone daily; pts with a history of grades 3 or 4 aGVHD were excluded. Lenalidomide was given orally daily for 28 days/cycle. Dosing escalation was performed using a standard 3 x 3 design, with dose level (DL) 1 = 5 mg , DL 2 = 10 mg, and DL 3 = 15 mg. Results: From 6/2011 to 10/2012, 17 pts with AML (n=13), CLL (n=1), and DLBCL (n=3) were enrolled (Table 1) and underwent RIC alloSCT. The majority of patients had a Disease Risk Index (Armand et al. Blood, 2014) of high or very high. Of enrolled pts, only 3 received lenalidomide. Of the pts who did not proceed to treatment at re-registration, 4 were ineligible due to relapse, 3 were ineligible due to elevated creatinine, 3 were ineligible due to GVHD, 2 declined, and 2 were not treated due to study closure. All pts who received lenalidomide were treated at DL 1. The first pt treated (00-06) received cycle 1 without toxicity. On cycle 2 day 9 he developed a skin rash consistent with acute GVHD and discontinued therapy. The second pt treated (00-11) developed skin rash and diarrhea on cycle 1 day 3 and was diagnosed with steroid refractory aGVHD of the GI tract. He expired from complications of treatment. The third pt treated (00-12) developed a skin rash and diarrhea on cycle 1 day 6. Lenalidomide was discontinued. Based on these outcomes, the study was closed due to concerns regarding the risk of severe aGVHD caused by lenalidomide. However, patients 00-06 and 00-12 remain alive and in CR days 958 and 751 post transplant, respectively. In the entire cohort, the median PFS was 103 days (range = 15-992) with median OS 103 days (range = 30-1085). Conclusion: Early administration of low-dose lenalidomide following alloSCT is not feasible due to potential increased risk of severe aGVHD and likelihood of elevated creatinine at this time point. However, 2 of 3 pts who received lenalidomide and responded to treatment for aGVHD remain in CR from their high-risk AML. Thus, an amended approach with lower/fewer dose of lenalidomide/cycle or alternatively, use in transplants that do not utilize calcineurin phosphatase inhibitors (such as T-cell depletion based approaches) warrants additional consideration.
