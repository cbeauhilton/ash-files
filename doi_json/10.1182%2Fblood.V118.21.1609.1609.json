    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1609 Introduction: Salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) remains to be the standard treatment for most patients with relapsed and refractory aggressive non- Hodgkin lymphoma(NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma(HL). However, there are no standard salvage chemotherapy regimens for these patients especially for refractory patients. The combination of gemcitabine, vinorelbine and liposomal-doxorubicin (GVD regimen) had been reported to be effective in patients with relapsed HL (N.L.Bartlett et al. Ann Oncol. 2007).The overall response rate was 70% and the complete remission rate was 19%. The main toxicities were mucositis (23%) and febrile neutropenia (9%). Despite this encouraging result in relapsed HL, it was still unclear whether GVD regimen was effective in recurrent aggressive NHL. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of GVD regimen in patients with refractory aggressive NHL and HL. Patients and methods: Patients with aggressive NHL and HL who were relapsed or refractory to at least one salvage chemotherapy regimen were enrolled. The GVD regimen was given as follows: gemcitabine: 1000 mg/m 2 intravenous(i.v.)on day 1,vinorelbine: 15 mg/m 2 i.v. on day 1\u2264\u2aa2liposomal-doxorubicin: 25 mg/m 2 i.v. on day 1, repeated for 14 days\u2264\u00aePatients with complete response (CR)or partial response (PR) proceeded to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) as consolidation. Results: From 1 May 2006 to 30 August 2008, 35 patients (25 NHL and 10 HL) were enrolled and received 129 cycles of chemotherapy. Twenty patients (57.1%) had been treated with at least 3 chemotherapy regimens before enrollment, and 15 patients (42.9%) had been treated with 2 chemotherapy regimens before. The overall response rate (ORR)was 48.6%(95% CI: 32.0%\u223c65.1%), with 31.4% CR rate(95%CI: 16.0%\u223c46.8%)\u2264\u00aeThe ORR was higher in patients with HL than in patients with NHL(80.0% vs. 36.0%,p=0.023). The ORR was higher in relapsed patients than in refractory patients(73.3% vs. 30.0%,p=0.013). Sixteen patients (9 NHL and 7 HL) were treated by high dose chemotherapy supported by ASCT. With median follow-up of 16 months (2\u223c61 months),the median progression free survival(PFS) was 5 months(1\u223c61 months) and the median survival time was 38 months (2\u223c61 months). 4-year PFS and 4-year overall survival was 28.1% and 58.2% respectively. The serum LDH level and the sequential ASCT were independent prognostic factors. The survival time in patients treated with subsequent ASCT was significantly longer than those without ASCT (median survival: not reached vs. 21 months, p=0.005). The major toxicity was myelosuppression. The incidence of grade \u00a2o\u0301/\u00a2o\u0302 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was 34.3% and 5.7% respectively\u2264\u00aeMobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cell was successful in all the 16 patients. There were no treatment-related deaths. Conclusion: GVD regimen is an effective and well-tolerated salvage regimen both for patients with HL and patients with aggressive NHL. GVD followed by AHST yields promising long-lime survival even in patients who are previously heavily treated.
