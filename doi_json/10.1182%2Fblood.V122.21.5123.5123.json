    "abstract_text": "Purpose Radioimmunotherapy combines biologic and radiolytic mechanisms to target and destroy tumor cells. 90 Y-Ibritumomab-Tiuxetan ( 90 YIT) is a murine anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody engaged for radioimmunotherapeutic targeting of CD20+ lymphoma cells. We report on our long-term follow-up data of 90 YIT as first-line or consolidation treatment in advanced stage follicular Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (FL). Patients & Methods Between March 2004 and October 2010, forty-seven patients with CD20+ FL grade 1 to 3a in stages II, III, or IV were treated with a single dose of 90 Yttrium-Ibritumomab-Tiuxetan ( 90 YIT) at our institution. The median age was 61 years (range 41-83; male 55%) and 77% (n=36) of patients were in an advanced stage of the disease (stage III/IV). 90 YIT was administered on an outpatient basis on day 8 after pretreatment with Rituximab (250mg/m\u00b2) on day 1. A mean of 1122 MBq (range 680-240) 90 YIT was administered. Fourteen patients received 90 YIT as first-line therapy, twenty-seven patients were treated with 90 YIT after a median of 2 pretreatment courses (range 1-5) as consolidation therapy in remission (15 patients in CR, 12 patients in PR), and six patients showed progressive disease (PD) at time of 90 YIT treatment. Median follow-up was 61 months (range 0-111). Results After a median follow-up of 61 months (range 0-111 months), 32 patients are still alive, including 21 patients in CR since 90 YIT treatment. There was no significant difference concerning PFS and OS between first-line treatment and consolidation treatment, but we found a significant difference, comparing these two groups versus PD (PFS 51 months vs. 48 months vs. 8 months, p<0.023; OS 59 months vs. 71 months vs. 10 months, p<0.002) (figure 1 & 2). Survival rates were 85% (first-line), 67% (consolidation) and 33% (PD), respectively. Patients who maintained a CR after 90 YIT treatment, showed significantly longer OS compared to patients with relapse after 90 YIT (71 months vs. 52 months, p<0.001). No significant difference in PFS and OS was seen, concerning sex, age, or clinical stage. No unexpected toxicities emerged during long-term follow-up. Conclusion 90 YIT as first-line, as well as consolidation therapy after achieving at least PR, provides a cost-efficient, long progression-free and overall survival in advanced stage FL. No benefit is shown in patients with PD, where we don't recommend 90 YIT treatment. Figure 1 View large Download slide Overall survival according to pretreatment status.
