    "abstract_text": "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by low platelet counts. ITP has a complex pathogenesis, in which both anti-platelet antibodies as well as T cells have been shown to be important. Initial management of newly diagnosed ITP may be either watchful waiting or pharmacologic intervention, such as glucocorticoids or Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg), a blood product consisting of polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) derived from thousands of donors. Second-line therapy may include dexamethasone, high-dose methylprednisolone, rituximab, thrombopoietin (TPO)-receptor agonists, or splenectomy. The working mechanism of IVIg is actively under investigation and is still a matter of debate, as various different working mechanisms have been suggested. One of them is that IVIg may shift the balance from a pro- to anti-inflammatory state through immunomodulating the activity of dendritic cells (DCs). To gain more insights into the role of DCs in ITP, upon IVIg treatment or splenectomy, we analyzed DC subsets in a murine model of ITP, which features both the antibody and T cell mediated thrombocytopenia. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were administrated 4x10 4 splenocytes from CD61 (GPIIIa) knockout mice immunized against CD61 (or na\u00efve control splenocytes) and the mice were treated with or without 1 g/kg IVIg twice a week. Also the same type of splenocytes were transferred into splenectomized SCID mice. Weekly platelet counts were assessed and after 4 weeks the mice were sacrificed and spleen and thymuses were harvested. Splenocytes and thymocytes were isolated and examined by flow cytometry for cross-presenting (XCR1+) and non-presenting tolerizing (SIRP alpha+) DCs. Without IVIg or splenectomy, both splenic DC subset numbers correlated positively with platelet counts and both the thymic DC subset numbers correlated negatively with platelet counts, indicating thymic retention of DC in a setting of thrombocytopenia. Interestingly, splenectomized SCID mice, apart from increased platelet counts, demonstrated a complete reversal of the DC pattern in the thymus, as thymic DC subsets correlated positively with platelet counts in splenectomized mice. Upon IVIg treatment, apart from a general increase in platelet counts, the splenic tolerizing DCs significantly increased in numbers. Moreover, the thymic retention of tolerizing DCs and thus the negative correlation with platelet counts (R 2 : 0.46, p<0.05) was fully abrogated upon IVIg treatment (R 2 : 0.02, NS). Overall, our results indicate that both splenectomy as well as IVIg treatment can immunomodulate thymic tolerizing DCs significantly, in a murine model of ITP.
