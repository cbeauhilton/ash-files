    "abstract_text": "Introduction Monocyte-derived fibrocytes are spindle-shaped fibroblast-like blood cells derived from a sub-population of CD14+ monocytes. Recent studies have shown that fibrocytes play a key role in the pathogenesis of primary myelofibrosis (MF), and these cells have attracted attention as novel therapeutic targets for MF treatment. Using a Romiplostim (Rom)-induced murine MF model, we have previously reported that fibrocyte differentiation, which is directly induced by activating the thorombopoietin receptor signaling pathway, can potentially trigger the progression of MF ( Leukemia 2017; 31: 2709). However, the precise molecular mechanism of fibrocyte activity in MF have not been elucidated. To address this question, we compared the RNA sequencing-based gene expression profiles of monocytes and fibrocytes and detected that fibrocytes exhibited a higher level of Chitinase 3-like 1 ( CHI3L1 ) expression than monocytes. CHI3L1, an 18-glycosyl hydrolase-related molecule, is a member of the enzymatically inactive chitinase-like protein family. These proteins are associated with inflammation, tissue remodeling, and organ fibrosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that CHI3L1 produced by fibrocytes is potentially involved in the progression of MF and could be a therapeutic target. In the present study, we evaluated CHI3L1 using serum samples obtained from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and a Rom-induced murine MF model. Methods Monocytes and fibrocytes (Day 9 and Day 12) were prepared using peripheral blood samples from healthy volunteers. Following total RNA extraction, RNA qualification, and library preparation, a Hiseq4000 (Illumina) system was used for RNA sequencing. ELISA-based analyses were performed using the supernatant of the blood cells to confirm the presence of the CHI3L1 protein. Furthermore, we determined the serum CHI3L1 levels of MPN patients with or without MF using ELISA-based analyses. Overall, 21 patients without MF and 31 patients with MF (MF-1 to MF-3) were enrolled after obtaining written informed consent. Using the Rom-induced murine MF model, we performed in vivo analyses of Chi3l1. Female C57BL/6J mice (8-week-old) were administered with 1 mg/kg Rom once a week for 2 or 3 weeks, following which serum samples, spleens, and bone marrow samples were examined. To eliminate fibrocytes, clodronate liposomes were administered to mice. Chi3l1-deficient ( Chi3l1 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice were administered with Rom in the same manner. Following these treatments, RT-PCR and histopathological analyses of bone marrow were conducted. Non-contact co-culture assays of human fibrocytes and fibroblasts were performed using the human fibroblast cell line HS-5 to evaluate the interaction between CHI3L1 and fibroblasts. HS-5 cells were cultured using the supernatant of fibrocytes with or without the neutralizing antibody for CHI3L1 and mRNA expression of HS-5 cells was examined. Results Comparing the RNA sequencing gene expression profiles of monocytes and fibrocytes revealed a significant increase in CHI3L1 expression associated with fibrocyte differentiation. ELISA-based analyses of human monocyte and fibrocyte supernatants confirmed that the secretion of CHI3l1 protein concurred with the amount of mRNA expression (P < 0.01) (a). We demonstrated that CHI3L1 levels were elevated in in serum samples obtained from MPN patients with MF (N = 31) compared with those obtained from patients without MF (N = 21; P = 0.027) (b). High levels of Chi3l1 mRNA expression were observed in the bone marrow of the Rom-induced murine MF model (P < 0.01), which was abrogated by clodronate treatment. Furthermore, compared with wild-type mice, Chi3l1 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed fewer reticulin fibers in silver-stained bone marrow sections (c) and significantly decreased Col3A1 and Acta2 mRNA expression in the bone marrow (P < 0.05). In addition, co-culture assays demonstrated that HS-5 cells cultured with the supernatant of fibrocytes showed significantly higher levels of COL1A1 and COL3A1 expression (P < 0.05) than that of monocytes and the addition of CHI3L1 neutralizing antibody abrogated these increases (d). Conclusion CHI3L1 is involved in the interaction between fibrocytes and fibroblasts and this molecule exacerbates the progression of bone marrow fibrosis by promoting the production of the extracellular matrix. Therefore, CHI3L1 could be a potential therapeutic target for MF treatment.
