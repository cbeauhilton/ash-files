    "abstract_text": "Background The incidence of VTE in African-Americans (AAs) is similar to or higher than in Americans of European ancestry. However, the carrier frequencies of inherited thrombophilias common in whites (i.e., Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin G20210A) are very low in AAs, suggesting that other inherited thrombophilias may be associated with VTE in AAs. Objective To identify potentially novel non-hypothesis-driven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with VTE in AAs. Methods We used the resources of the eMERGE Network to perform a GWAS of VTE in AAs. The eMERGE Network (funded by NHGRI) is comprised of nine sites each with DNA biobanks linked to electronic health records (EHRs). Approximately 39,206 unique DNA samples have been genotyped using either Affymetrix or Illumina genome-wide SNP arrays. Led by the Coordinating Center and eMERGE genomics workgroup, an imputation pipeline was developed for merging genomic data across the different SNP arrays used by the eMERGE sites, to maximize sample size and the power to detect associations. The imputation was performed using the 1000 Genomes Cosmopolitan reference panel which includes 1092 individuals and over 36 million SNPs. From our previously-identified cohort of Olmsted County, MN residents with incident or recurrent VTE, 1996-2005, we derived and validated an EHR-driven phenotype extraction algorithm that leveraged structured data based on ICD-9-CM codes and unstructured data from clinical notes via natural language processing to identify VTE cases and controls with 100% and 94% positive and negative predictive values, respectively. We tested for an association between each SNP and VTE among AAs using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex and eMERGE site. Results Among 294 AA VTE cases and 3,661 AA controls (total n=3,955; females, n=2,512), the Factor V Leiden ( F5 rs6025) was not analyzed due to a very low minor allele frequency (MAF=0.0036). The prothrombin G20210A ( F2 rs1799963) and ABO blood type O ( ABO rs8176719) SNPs were not genotyped in any of the arrays and could not be imputed. Among SNPs with an imputation score >0.8, the most significant SNPs associated with VTE were ITPR3 (inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 3) rs2229637 (OR=1.65; p=3.61E-07; MAF=0.19) and CLEC7A (C-type lectin domain family 7, member A) rs59819090 (OR=2.16; p=1.06E-06; MAF=0.056). ITPR3 SNPs have been associated with coronary artery aneurysm in Kawasaki disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus and other autoimmune disorders. CLEC7A rs59819090 encodes for a serine82 to leucine nonsynonymous amino acid change in dectin-1. Dectin-1 is a transmembrane innate immune pattern recognition receptor on myeloid cells that upon binding it\u2019s agonist, \u03b2-glucans, stimulates cytokine production and the respiratory burst, a prerequisite for formation of neutrophil extracelluar traps (NETs). NETs have been associated with VTE (van Montfoort, et al. Ateriosclero Thromb Vasc Biol 2013;33:147-51). Dectin-1 serine82 is not evolutionarily conserved and the serine82 to leucine amino acid change is predicted to be tolerated, with a moderate effect on protein function. Conclusions ITPR3 rs2229637 and CLAC7A rs59819090 may be associated with VTE in African-Americans. These observations require replication and functional studies toward understanding how they may lie on the causal pathway to VTE. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
