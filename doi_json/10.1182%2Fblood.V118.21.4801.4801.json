    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4801 Cell-derived membrane enclosed vesicles containing mRNA, protein, microRNA, and DNA, can enter cells and effect a phenotype change. We have shown that lung-derived microvesicles enter marrow cells inducing them to express pulmonary epithelial cell-specific protein and mRNA, a variety of microRNA and to enhance their capacity to engraft in irradiated mice and express the phenotype of type II pneumocytes (Aliotta et al, Exp Hematol 38,2010). In the present studies using rat/mouse hybrid cultures and measuring species-specific mRNA, we have shown that immediately after co-culture of rat lung across from mouse marrow, mouse marrow cells express both rat and mouse specific surfactants B and C mRNA. However, when these cells are cultured in steel factor supported long-term culture, rat-specific mRNA disappears rapidly, while mouse-specific mRNA persists out to 12 weeks in liquid culture. Identical studies with rat liver cultured across from mouse marrow have shown early expression in mouse marrow of both rat and mouse albumin mRNA, but in long term in vitro culture, expression of albumin mRNA was mouse-specific. Thus, the major long-term persistent event is an alteration of transcription in the target marrow cells. In a similar fashion, marrow modulated by lung microvesicles in vitro and engrafted into lethally irradiated (950 cGy split dose) mice, evidences expression of pulmonary epithelial cell-specific mRNA or protein (surfactants) in host lung, marrow, thymus, spleen and liver 6 weeks after engraftment \u2013 the furthest time tested. These results indicate that microvesicle cell fate modulation is biologically meaningful and represents an important new mechanism for cell phenotype determination.
