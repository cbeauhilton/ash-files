    "abstract_text": "Androgens are widely used for treating Fanconi anemia and other human bone marrow failure syndromes, but their mode of action remains incompletely understood. Aged Fancd2 -/- mice were used to assess the therapeutic efficacy of oxymetholone and its mechanism of action. 18-month old Fancd2 -/- mice recapitulated key human Fanconi anemia phenotypes including reduced bone marrow cellularity, red cell macrocytosis, and peripheral pancytopenia. As in humans, chronic oxymetholone treatment significantly improved these hematological parameters by stimulating the proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. RNAseq analysis implicated down-regulation of osteopontin as an important mechanism for the drug\u2019s action. Consistent with the increased stem cell proliferation, competitive repopulation assays demonstrated that chronic oxymetholone therapy eventually resulted in stem cell exhaustion. These results expand our knowledge of the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and have direct clinical implications for the treatment of bone marrow failure.
