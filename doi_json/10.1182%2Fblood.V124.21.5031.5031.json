    "abstract_text": "Background Hemophilia A is an X-linked inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII (FVIII). It is treated by infusion of FVIII clotting factor concentrate with dosing based primarily on bodyweight. Previous studies evaluating perioperative dosing strategies in hemophilia conclude that improvement with regard to consumption of clotting factor concentrates is possible. However, the magnitude and complexity of the problem has not yet been addressed. Moreover, guidelines to optimize treatment have been lacking. Methods In a retrospective multicenter study, we evaluated perioperative management in hemophilia A patients with clotting factor VIII (FVIII) plasma levels below 0.05 IUml -1 by quantification of perioperative infusion of clotting factor concentrate and achieved FVIII plasma levels, while exploring possible modifiers of clotting factor concentrate consumption. Results Data was collected in a total of 198 surgical procedures in 119 patients; 75 adults (140 surgical procedures; median age: 48 years; median weight: 80 kg) and 44 children (58 surgical procedures; median age: 4 years; median weight: 19 kg). In adults, mainly medium risk surgical procedures (n=86; 61%) were performed, which were most often orthopedic procedures (n=91; 65%). Children mainly underwent low risk surgical procedures (n=47; 81%), most frequently an insertion or removal of a central venous device (n=31; 53%). The median duration of hospitalization in adults and children was respectively nine (IQR 5-14) and seven (IQR 6-10) days; p =0.09. The median amount of clotting factor concentrate infused per surgical procedure was 26,100 IU (69 IUkg -1 day -1 ). Depending on post-operative day, 67-81% of achieved FVIII plasma levels were outside of the predefined target range recommended by National Hemophilia Consensus. Moreover, 45% of FVIII plasma levels were below target range between 0-24 hours after surgery with the median deviation below the lowest required target level of 0.17 IUml -1 . More than six days after surgery, 75% of the FVIII plasma levels were above target range with the median deviation above the highest target level of 0.31 IUml -1 . No significant difference in frequency of under dosing or overdosing was demonstrated in adults or children. Neither was mode of administration of replacement therapy (continuous or bolus), or type of surgical procedure (low or medium risk), significantly related with under dosing or overdosing ( Figure 1 A-D). Moreover, under dosing was not correlated with clinical bleeding and overdosing did not lead to observed cases of vascular thrombosis. Overall, in this study population the total amount of clotting factor concentrate under dosed amounted to 422,000 IU and overdosed amounted to 3,320,300 IU, when calculated using the median deviation of achieved FVIII levels in comparison to the predefined target range and an in vivo recovery of 2.0 IUml -1 per 1 IUkg -1 , a crude median half-life of FVIII concentrate of 12 hours and an overall median hospitalization period of nine days. Importantly, a reduction of clotting factor concentrate consumption of approximately 49% would have been realized if predefined plasma target levels could have been achieved. Conclusion Targeting of clotting FVIII levels in the perioperative setting is complex and forms a \u201cmoving target\u201d for treating professionals. Optimization of dosing strategies by construction of algorithms with minimization of both under dosing and overdosing is obligatory to improve quality of care with a reduction of bleeding risk, a possible decrease of clotting factor concentrate consumption and potential cost reduction of treatment.
