    "abstract_text": "Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) regulates the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and activation of hematopoietic cells, dendritic cells, and T cells. Upon GM-CSF binding, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits of the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR) dimerize and activate signaling. While exploring a possible role for GM-CSF in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we found that GM-CSF did not enhance the phosphorylation of STAT3, Akt, or ERK, suggesting that GM-CSF does not directly affect CLL cells. Indeed, as in normal B cells, flow cytometry analysis of CLL cells did not detect GM-CSFR\u03b2. However, unlike in normal B cells, GM-CSFR\u03b1 (CD116) was present in CLL cells. Using confocal microscopy, cell fractionation studies, and GM-CSFR\u03b1 antibody epitope mapping, we detected GM-CSFR\u03b1 not only on the surfaces but also in the cytosol and nuclei of CLL cells, suggesting that GM-CSFR\u03b1 has functions that are unrelated to receptor-ligand interaction. Because STAT3 is constitutively activated in CLL cells and because the promoter of the GM-CSFR\u03b1 gene harbors putative STAT3 binding sites, we hypothesized that STAT3 activates GM-CSFR\u03b1 in CLL cells. Both chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analyses revealed that STAT3 binds to the promoter of GM-CSFR\u03b1. We therefore cloned the GM-CSFR\u03b1 promoter in multiple myeloma cell line MM1 and used luciferase assay we identified STAT3 binding activity. To investigate the function of GM-CSFR\u03b1, we induced the overexpression of GM-CSFR\u03b1 in 293FT cells and analyzed the RNA and protein that co-immunoprecipitated with GM-CSFR\u03b1. We identified 7200 RNA transcripts that co-immunoprecipitated with GM-CSFR\u03b1, including SKI and MAFA oncogenes, two serine/threonine kinase genes, and DEFT1P2 and DEFP1P, which encode proteins that belong to members of the death effector domains family, known to have a role in modulating apoptosis. Overall, the transcripts that co-immunoprecipitated with GM-CSFR\u03b1 belong to survival pathways, the JAK/STAT pathway, and hematopoietic lineage pathways. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that housekeeping proteins, chaperon proteins, KAP1, and ISG-15 co-immunoprecipitated with GM-CSFR\u03b1. We found that GM-CSFR\u03b1\u2013bound KAP1 enhanced the transcriptional activity of STAT3, whereas GM-CSFR\u03b1\u2013bound ISG-15 inhibited the nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway. Nevertheless, overexpression of GM-CSFR\u03b1 protected MM1 cells from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, and GM-CSFR\u03b1-siRNA induced the apoptosis of CLL cells. Taken together, our data suggest that STAT3 induces the transcription of GM-CSFR\u03b1, which has distinct, ligand-independent, anti-apoptotic activities.
