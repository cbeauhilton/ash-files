    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1937 Background: Despite the advantages of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) over conventional chemotherapy, the results of ASCT in multiple myeloma (MM) are still unsatisfactory. Intravenous (iv) melphalan at a dose of 200 mg/m 2 is the most commonly used conditioning regimen for ASCT. However, better conditioning regimens are still needed, and more intensive conditioning regimens have been investigated. We evaluated the role of bortezomib-containing regimen (escalated dose of bortezomib + iv busulfan and iv melphalan) in the MM patients who had a sensitive response to bortezomib during the induction chemotherapy. In the phase 1 trial, we assessed the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) of bortezomib. The trial is registered on National Cancer Institute website, number NCT01255527 . Methods: Nine MM patients who were candidate for ASCT enrolled in this study. M:F=5:4 and median age were 59 (34\u201362). They were treated with escalating doses of bortezomib as a conditioning regimen (N=3/group; 0.7, 1.0, and 1.3 mg/m 2 on D-6, D-3 & D+1) and a fixed dose of busulfan (3.2 mg/kg from D-5 to D-3) and melphalan (140 mg/m 2 on D-2). Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were defined as any toxicity of grade 3 or greater, with the following exceptions: vomiting, fatigue, alopecia, libido, amenorrhea, nausea, febrile neutropenia, infection, anorexia, depression, anxiety, and cytopenias. Grade 3/4 hematological toxicity was acceptable. Grade 4 of mucositis, \u00b0A\u0303 Grade 3 diarrhea and \u00b0A\u0303 Grade 3 cardiac toxicity were regarded as DLT. Only one patients had grade 3 oral mucositis and there were no other non hematologic toxicities of grade 3 or greater. DLT refers only to toxic events (symptomatic grade \u00b0A\u0303 3 toxicity) that occur until day +28 after ASCT and are attributed as possibly, probably, or definitely due to treatment. Results: Four patients had grade 3 oral mucositis (2 in 0.7 mg/m 2 group, 1 in 1.0 mg/m 2 group and 1 in 1.3 mg/m 2 group), but no grade 4 (considered as DLT) oral mucositis. No other non hematologic toxicities of grade 3 or greater. Therefore, there were no dose limiting toxicities in this phase 1 trial and MTD of bortezomib was 1.3 mg/m 2 . Median times to ANC > 0.5 \u00b7 10 6 /L and platelet > 20 \u00b7 10 6 /L were 12 and 10 days, respectively, with no graft failures. All patients achieved at least very good partial response. Six patients (67%) achieved complete remission(CR) after ASCT. Conclusion: In the phase 1 trial, MTD of bortezomib was 1.3 mg/m 2 . Addition of bortezomib to busulfan and melphalan conditioning regimen shows to be safe, well-tolerated and worthy of phase 2 trial.
