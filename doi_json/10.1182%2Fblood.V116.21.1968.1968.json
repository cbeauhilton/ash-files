    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1968 Two previous studies have reported that multiple myeloma (MM) patients (pts) with t(4;14), identified by FISH cytogenetics, experience a median progression-free survival (PFS) of only 8\u20139 mos and median overall survival (OS) of 18 mos when treated with a single ASCT (Chang H, et al. Bone Marrow Transplant 2005; 36: 793; Gertz M, et al. Blood 2005; 106: 2837). On the other hand, the novel agent bortezomib is efficacious in relapsed myeloma pts with t(4;14). Based on these observations, we designed a phase II protocol for newly diagnosed MM pts with t(4;14) that consists of induction with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, bortezomib and dexamethasone (DBD) \u00d7 4 cycles, followed by post-induction therapy with oral cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 days 1,8 15, 22 with bortezomib 1.5 mg/m 2 days 1,8,15 and prednisone 100 mg q 2 days of a 28-day cycle (CyBor-P) \u00d7 8 additional cycles. Maintenance therapy with dexamethasone (dex) 40 mg/month was then administered until progression. Although elective stem cell collection was recommended after induction, routine ASCT was not performed in the absence of disease progression. Between February 2008-July 2010, the bone marrows of 201 newly diagnosed MM pts were screened for t(4;14) in 7 Canadian centers, and 31 (15.4%) were found to be positive by FISH. Five pts did not meet the criteria for symptomatic MM, 4 had received \u2265 2 mos of prior therapy, 1 refused treatment and 2 were ineligible due to peripheral neuropathy or renal failure. Nineteen pts have been entered onto study. One of these was later determined to have a variant abnormality of chromosome 4 but not t(4;14) and underwent ASCT after induction; this pt is included in the safety analysis only. The median age was 60 yrs (45-69) and 53% were male. The median percent nuclei positive for t(4;14) was 26% (3-44%), serum \u03b22-microglobulin was 318 nmol/L (43-1695) and albumin was 36 g/L (28-48); 6 pts had ISS stage 1, 6 had stage 2 and 5 had stage 3 MM. Immunoglobulin subtype included IgG\u03ba (5), IgG\u03bb (4), IgA\u03ba (3), IgA\u03bb (4), \u03bb LC (1) and nonsecretory (1). To date, 15 pts have commenced DBD induction (57 total cycles administered), 12 have started post-induction CyBor-P (67 total cycles) and 6 are on maintenance dex (35 total cycles). Using modified Uniform criteria, the best response in 15 evaluable pts includes: sCR in 3 (20%), CR in 3 (20%), VGPR in 6 (40%), PR in 1 (6.7%) and stable disease in 2 (13.3%). Four have progressed a median of 3 mos (1-11) after commencing induction; one who progressed through DBD remains in nCR 1.5 yrs after salvage D-PACE followed by ASCT and lenalidomide maintenance. Fourteen SAEs occurred, of which 11 were grade 3 and 0 were grade 4; 5 pts developed grade 2 peripheral neuropathy (numbness and tingling) during induction with DBD. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was seen in 2/0 pts, and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia in 2/1 pts, respectively. Two pts have died, due to MM progression in 1 and complex medical problems including syringomyelia with progressive weakness/ruptured diverticuli/depression in another who withdrew consent despite achieving VGPR with induction. Median follow-up (F/U) is 9.4 mos (1-23). Actuarial PFS is 66% (95% CI 42\u2013100%) and overall survival is 92% (95%CI 79\u2013100%) at 1 year. We conclude: 1) the incidence of t(4;14) by FISH in newly diagnosed MM pts is 15.4% as expected; 2) 26% of newly diagnosed pts with this entity have asymptomatic MM; 3) this bortezomib-based regimen is well-tolerated; 4) the overall response rate (sCR + CR + VGPR + PR) is 87%; 5) preliminarily, the 1-year PFS and OS with this approach compare favorably with reports of single ASCT in t(4;14) positive MM, although longer follow-up is required.
