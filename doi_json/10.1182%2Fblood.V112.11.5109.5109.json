    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Serum free light chain (sFLC) measurements are having a big impact in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with monoclonal gammopathies. Utility is largely dependent upon assessing FLC kappa/lambda (\u03ba/\u03bb) ratios as the determinant of tumor clonality. To date, intact immunoglobulin measurements comprise total IgG, IgA and IgM, the measurement of bands on gels by serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) or immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE). We hypothesised that analysis of intact immunoglobulin molecules for their light chain content and light chain ratios might be clinically useful in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Methods: Monospecific polyclonal antisera were produced against IgG\u03ba, IgG\u03bb, IgA\u03ba and IgA\u03bb, using a combination of tolerisation and affinity chromatography. The four reagents reacted only with conformational epitopes that spanned the quaternary junctional regions between bound \u03ba or \u03bb light chains and their respective heavy chain partners. Antisera were then tailored for use as nephelometric homogeneous immunoassays on a Siemens Dade-Behring BN \u2122 II clinical laboratory analyser. Reagents were assessed for normal ranges (using blood donor sera) and clinical utility in IgG and IgA MM sera. Results: For IgG, normal median values (and 95% ranges) in 108 sera were: IgG\u03ba 6,981 mg/L (3,608\u201311,655); IgG\u03bb 3,946 mg/L (2,023\u20139,158); IgG\u03ba/IgG\u03bb ratio 1.8 (1.15\u20132.70). Correlation of IgG\u03ba+IgG\u03bb vs total IgG, 0.8: p<0.01 (Pearson\u2019s rank test). For IgA in 191 normal sera, respective values were: IgA\u03ba 1,270 mg/L (440\u20132,360); IgA\u03bb 870 mg/L (340\u20131,850); IgA\u03ba/IgA\u03bb ratio 1.47 (0.58\u20132.52). Correlation of IgA\u03ba+IgA\u03bb vs total IgA, 0.924: p<0.001. For IgG MM sera, sensitivity of the IgG\u03ba/IgG\u03bb ratios were compared to IFE. In all of 19 presentation sera and all samples during serial monitoring of 9 patients (4 IgG\u03ba; 5 IgG\u03bb), the appropriate immunoglobulin results were elevated and IgG\u03ba/IgG\u03bb ratios were abnormal indicating similar or greater sensitivity. In 3/9 patients during monitoring, IgG\u03ba or IgG\u03bb results were abnormal at complete remission (as judged by normal IFE results). Overall, relapse and responses were also detected earlier by IgG\u03ba or IgG\u03bb than by SPE or IFE. In addition, 2/9 patients showed discordant results with no change in IgG\u03ba/IgG\u03bb ratios during chemotherapy but a marked fall in total IgG measurements. For IgA MM presentation sera, all 83 had abnormal IgA\u03ba/IgA\u03bb ratios but 46 could not be quantified by SPE because of diffuse or overlapping protein bands. In 14 patients assessed during disease monitoring, all samples had IgA\u03ba/IgA\u03bb ratios that corresponded with IFE; in 5/14 patients, the results could not be quantified by SPE because IgA bands were masked by other proteins. Kaplan Meier survival curves on patients with ratios (either IgA\u03ba/IgA\u03bb or IgA\u03bb\u03ba/IgA\u03ba) greater than 500 (mean 449: range 4.96\u20133,675) had worse outcome than below 500 ratios; 23 vs 34 months (p<0.05). Conclusion: Measurements of IgG\u03ba, IgG\u03bb, IgA\u03ba and IgA\u03bb and their ratios were clinically at least as sensitive as SPE and IFE, both at diagnosis and for identifying residual disease. Furthermore, they provided quantitative results compared with the non-quantitative IFE method. Initial results for IgA\u03ba/IgA\u03bb ratios indicate a prognostic value at disease presentation suggesting a better clinical utility than total IgA measurements. Furthermore, IgG\u03ba/IgG\u03bb and IgA\u03ba/IgA\u03bb ratios may provide improved assessment of tumor responsiveness during monitoring in a similar manner to FLC \u03ba/\u03bb ratios. This may be due, in part, to the ratios compensating for changes in blood and plasma volume and reduced expression of FcRn IgG recycling receptors, resulting from chemotherapy."
