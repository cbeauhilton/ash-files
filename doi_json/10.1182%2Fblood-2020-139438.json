    "abstract_text": "Background: Systemic AL amyloidosis is a rare disease characterized by amyloid fibril deposits, most commonly in the heart and kidneys; there are currently no health authority-approved treatments. Therapies for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), including bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCd), have been shown to improve outcomes in AL amyloidosis, but more effective therapies are needed to achieve deep and rapid hematologic responses, reverse amyloid-mediated organ dysfunction, and improve overall survival. Daratumumab is an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody approved as monotherapy or in combination with other agents for the treatment of MM. ANDROMEDA (NCT03201965) is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled phase 3 trial of VCd \u00b1 daratumumab subcutaneous (DARA SC) in patients with newly-diagnosed AL amyloidosis. After a median follow-up of 11.4 months, the complete hematologic response rate was 53% for DARA SC + VCd (DARA-VCd) and 18% for VCd (odds ratio, 5.1; 95% CI, 3.2-8.2; P <0.0001). Here, we present patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from ANDROMEDA. Methods: Patients with newly-diagnosed AL amyloidosis with measurable hematologic disease, \u22651 involved organ, cardiac stage (Mayo 2004) I-IIIA, eGFR \u226520 mL/min, and absence of symptomatic MM were randomized 1:1 to DARA-VCd or VCd and treated for six 28-day cycles; thereafter, patients in the DARA-VCd group received DARA SC alone every 4 weeks for up to 24 cycles. PROs were assessed on Day 1 of Cycles 1-6 for both treatment groups and every 8 weeks thereafter in the DARA-VCd group. PRO assessments included the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30-item (EORTC QLQ-C30), the EuroQol 5-dimensional descriptive system (EQ-5D-5L), and Short Form-36 (SF-36). Improvements in EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status (GHS) and fatigue scale scores and SF-36 mental component summary (MCS) score were secondary endpoints. Assessment of physical functioning, symptom improvement, functional improvement, and health utility as measured by the SF-36, EORTC QLQ-C30 with supplemental symptom items, and the EQ-5D-5L were exploratory outcomes. Patients completed PRO questionnaires prior to study assessments or study drug administration. Analyses of PROs were performed on the intent-to-treat analysis set; patients without a baseline or post-baseline assessment were censored at date of randomization. Compliance with PRO assessments was calculated as the number of assessments received divided by the number of assessments expected at each time point. Descriptive statistics are provided for all PRO endpoints at each time point by treatment group. A distribution-based method was used to define worsening/improvement in scores. Time to worsening/improvement, hazard ratios, and associated 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Kaplan Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards regression. Change from baseline at each time point up to Cycle 6 (Week 24) was calculated using a mixed effects model with repeated measures with patients as a random effect and baseline value, treatment group, time (weeks), treatment-by-time interaction, and stratification factors as fixed effects. Results: A total of 388 patients were randomized (DARA-VCd, n=195; VCd, n=193). Compliance rates for all PRO questionnaires were >90% at baseline and >83% through Cycle 6. Median time to improvement was shorter and median time to worsening was longer in the DARA-VCd group than in the VCd group for EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS and fatigue scales and EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale (VAS) ( Table 1 ). Least squares mean scores for EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS and fatigue, EQ-5D-5L VAS, and SF-36 MCS remained stable in the DARA-VCd group but worsened compared with baseline in the VCd group; between-group differences are shown in Table 2 . The greatest between-group differences in PRO score changes from baseline were observed at Week 16 (Cycle 4). After Cycle 6, patients in the DARA-VCd group reported improvements in mean GHS and fatigue scores that continued while on treatment ( Figure ). Conclusions: Patients with AL amyloidosis treated with DARA-VCd experienced clinical improvements without any decrement in health-related quality of life over 6 cycles. Following Cycle 6, improvements in GHS and fatigue were reported in patients in the DARA-VCd group. These findings further support the value of DARA-VCd in patients with AL amyloidosis.
