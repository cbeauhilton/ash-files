    "abstract_text": "We and others have found that platelets play an important role in the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells to sights of vascular injury. However, it is not clear whether the EPCs mature and differentiate to endothelial cells following recruitment to the vascular injury sites. In addition, there is limited in vivo data to support the role of EPCs in re-endothlialization following vascular injury. We conducted in vitro experiments to investigate the maturation of EPCs on platelet based-media and in vivo experiments to evaluate the recruitment of EPCs following vascular injury. In in vitro experiments human EPCs were isolated from donated buffy coats by magnetic microbeads and flow cytometry cell sorting using CD133 and VEGFR-2, respectively, as cell markers. Isolated viable EPCs (CD133+, VEGFR-2+ cells) were plated on human fibronectin or a monolayer of washed human platelets. Cell colonies were counted 7 days after plating and stained for the endothelial cell markers CD31 (PECAM-1) and CD144 (VE-cadherin). The mean number of colony-forming cells was 35\u00b12.6 colonies/10 6 cells on platelets, which was significantly higher than 18\u00b14.2 colonies/10 6 cells on fibronectin (n = 4, P<0.01). Apart from the difference in colony numbers, the EPC colonies grew faster on the platelet substrate, were larger, and had more spindle-shaped cells (Figure 1 - staining of EPC colonies for CD31 and CD144). In the in vivo experiments a model of transluminal injury to mouse femoral arteries was used. Femoral artery denudation was performed by 0.25-mm-diameter angioplasty guidewire. Injured femoral arteries were compared to the contra-lateral controls (uninjured), and were harvested 1.5 hours following the injury and immunostaining performed with an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody. Four experiments showed a markedly higher number of VEGFR-2+ cells in the artery that has undergone denudation. These experiments indicate that a media composed of platelets promotes the maturation and differentiation of EPCs. Furthermore, in vivo, EPCs are recruited early following vascular injury. Thus, homing, maturation, and differentiation of EPCs are mediated by platelets.",
