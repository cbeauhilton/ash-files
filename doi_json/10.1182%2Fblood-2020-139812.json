    "abstract_text": "HbS (HBB:c.20A>T, beta 6 Glu>Val) is a frequent Hb variant in Mexico, in particular in some regions close to the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, with carrier frequencies from 0.5 to 12.8%, therefore Sickle Cell Disease patients are often seen in those regions. It is well known that increased levels of Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) ameliorates the clinical complications of sickle cell disease. Several genetic studies have identified BCL11A , HBS1L - MYB (intergenic region), HBG2 and HBBP1 genes, among others, to be involved in HbF regulation; DNA variants in these loci are associated to elevated HbF. The aim of present study was to analyze 15 variants in HbF regulatory loci in Mexican patients with Sickle Cell Disease. About 10 mL of peripheral blood was collected in EDTA for hematological and molecular testing from 24 sickle cell anemia patients (S/S) and 15 sickle cell trait carriers (S/A) from Southern Mexico, 13 were from the state of Guerrero and 26 from Chiapas. All subjects voluntarily agreed to participate in this study and gave signed informed consent; underaged patients' consent was obtained from their parents; all procedures were performed according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Hemoglobin S genotype was determined by Sanger sequencing; DNA variants genotyping was performed by qPCR using commercial Taqman probes for the following variants: in BCL11A rs11886868, rs4671393, rs7557939, rs1427407, rs766432, rs6706648, rs7599488; in HBS1L - MYB rs7776054, rs28384513, rs9399137, rs4895441, rs9402686, rs1320963, in HBG2 rs7482144 and in HBBP1 rs10128556. Hematological and clinical data were analyzed by IBM SPSS v24\u00ae. A total of 39 sickle cell patients were studied, twenty-one patients were male and 18 were female (53.8% and 46.2% respectively). Thirty-two were pediatric age patients and 7 adults. Anemia was observed in all S/S patients, eight had severe anemia (<8 g/dL); on the other hand, only 5/15 S/A patients had anemia (10 - 12 g/dL); HbF over 5% was observed in 23/24 S/S patients and in 13/15 S/A had HbF from 2% - 5%. Nineteen S/S patients were treated with hydroxyurea and presented less severe phenotype and more elevated HbF, however, the statistical analysis showed no significant differences (12.9% vs 8.9% p =0.248) (Table 1). Genotype and allele frequencies are displayed in Table 2. All minor alleles were observed in frequencies over 0.05, the mo2st commonly observed minor allele was BCL11A rs1427407 (0.69), and the less frequently observed was HBBP1 rs101028556 (0.08). The allele frequencies of four HbF regulating variants were significant different from those reported for Mexican ancestry population (MXL) in 1000 Genome database (rs11886868 C>T, rs4671393 A>G, rs7599488 C>T and rs10128556 C>T), however, the analyzed sample in this study is undersized and is not representative of the global Mexican population. No differences were observed when comparing allele frequencies from Guerrero vs Chiapas patients, nor S/S vs S/A. The correlation analysis of minor allele count (MAC) and HbF demonstrated no association when comparing it to HbF levels. Likewise, the analysis was performed on BCL11A and HBS1L - MYB variants and showed no significant correlations. There was also no correlation between MAC and the other hematological parameters (RBC, Hb, PCV, MCV and MCH). We report the first study of HbF regulating DNA variants in Mexican sickle cell disease patients. The preliminary analysis of HbF vs minor allele count showed no relation of total MAC and increased HbF, neither with the variants of BCL11A or HBS1L - MYB .
