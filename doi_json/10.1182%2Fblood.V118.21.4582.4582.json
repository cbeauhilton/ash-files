    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4582 Introduction: Introduction of imatinib mesylate has changed the approach towards bone marrow transplantation in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). Historically considered as a curative therapeutic option, with a probability of disease free survival ranging from 40 to 60%. Its indicated use has been restricted to patients with treatment failure to prior tyrosin-kinase inhibitors or blast crisis. Objective: To assess the outcome of patients with CML who undergo BMT Materials and methods: 66 patients who underwent allogeneic BMT between the years 1994 and 2011 in two health care facilities were analyzed. 63 (93%) were performed between 1994 and 2005. At the time of transplantation, patient status was: 56 patients in 1 st Chronic Phase and 10 in advanced phases. Fourteen patients received Unrelated Donor BMT and 37 had Related Donor BMT. Transplant risk was assessed, based on the European Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) score (sc). The conditioning regimens which were used included: for patients in chronic phase, cyclophosphamide (Cy) and busulfan (Bu) and for patients in accelerated phase etoposide (VP 16) was added to the previous regimen, and for unrelated donors BuCy + ATG or alentuzumab was used. Prophylaxis for Graft vs Host Disease (GVHD) was performed with a two-drug regimen (cyclosporine, methotrexate), with or without methylprednisone. Result: 66 patients were recorded (28 female/38 male), with a mean age of 35 years at the time of transplantation (range 8\u201355) . The source of Stem Cell was bone marrow in 60 patients and peripheral blood in 6 patients. 43% of patients developed GVHD: (29 patients) according to clinical criteria established by the European Cooperative Group. Overall Survival (OS) was 50% with a mean follow-up of 48 months. Analyzed according to the EBMT risk score, OS was 64% in the 0\u20132 score group and 31% in patients with a 3\u20135 score. Procedure-related mortality was 16%, and the most frequent causes included: hepatic veno-occlusive disease, infections, GVHD, and graft failure. Conclusions: BMT in patients with CML has been substantially reduced since the introduction of tyrosin-kinase inhibitors. In our experience, this shows its healing potential with an extended follow-up and a prolonged survival. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
