    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-Cell therapy is approved for relapse/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients after two lines of therapy. Although it is an effective treatment, approximately 20-30% of patients have an early relapse. In this context, biomarkers that helps to identify those patients who will be refractory to this therapy are relevant. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has emerged as a new tool for non-invasive monitoring of patients with lymphoma, therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate dynamic cfDNA concentration in addition to other biomarkers (LDH, CRP, ferritin) before CAR T-cell infusion to detect early progressors. Methods: We selected 44 r/r DLBCL patients treated with CAR T-cell in our centre. Plasma samples were collected pre-apheresis (PA) and pre-infusion (PI)(\u2206cfDNA). Other biomarkers (LDH, CRP, Ferritin) were studied PA, pre-lymphodepletion (PL) and PI, tumour volume metabolic (TMV) are also studied. CfDNA were obtained from plasma using QIAamp\u00ae Circulating Nucleic Acid (Qiagen) and quantified by QuantiFluor dsDNA System (Promega). The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare differences between two independent quantitative variables . ROC analysis was conducted to determine the cut-off value of biomarkers. Cumulative incidence of progression (1 and 3 months) was calculated from the date of CAR T-cell infusion. Data analysis was performed using Stata. Results: Cumulative incidence of relapse at 1 month and 3 months was 20% and 30% respectively. The correlation between the progression (1 month, 3 months) and the different biomarkers is shown in Table 1. The CRP PL, CRP PI, LDH PI and \u2206cfDNA (PI-PA, median time 41.5 days [range:31-107]) was correlated with early progression (1 month). No differences were found with progression at 3 months. The different cut-off for the biomarkers selected was 9 ng/mL for \u2206cfDNA, 225 U/L for LDH and 1.35 mg/dL for CRP. Cumulative incidence of progression at 1 month was calculated for these biomarkers (figure 1): \u2206cfDNA, HR: 4.3 (1.05-17), p=0.042; CRP PL: HR: 6.9 (1.5-31.1), p=0.012; CRP PI, HR: 11.2 (1.5-83), p=0.019 and LDH PI, HR: 3.4 (1-17) p=0.11. It should be noted that 83.3% (10/12) of the patients who progressed during the first month had at least one of the above variables. Conclusions : Our results highlight that increase in cfDNA higher than 9 ng/mL, CRP PL and PI >1.35 mg/dL and LDH PI > 225 U/L before CAR T-cell therapy may detect early progressors within the first month after treatment. Therefore, \u2206cfDNA, CRP and LDH could be useful to identify patients who highly probable will not benefit from the CAR T infusion, in which another prior strategy could be considered in an attempt to control the disease. These results need to be confirmed with a larger cohort.
