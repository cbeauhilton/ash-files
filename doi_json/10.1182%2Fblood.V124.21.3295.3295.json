    "abstract_text": "Introduction . Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with 11q deletion has been associated to a poor prognosis, but the clinical course of patients carrying this lesion is variable. This aberration, most often monoallelic, is present in 10-17% of newly diagnosed CLL and in 20-30% of patients with progressive or chemorefractory disease. The minimal deleted region (MDR) (2-3 Mbp) is located on the 11q22.3-q23.1 region and includes ATM . Moreover, 30-40% of 11q- CLL have also an inactivating ATM mutation on the other allele. The deleted region on 11q can also include BIRC3 , a gene that is often deleted or mutated in advanced/chemorefractory stages of the disease. Although BIRC3 disruption has been associated to a poor prognosis, its prognostic implications in addition to ATM deletion are not well defined. The aim of this study was to perform a copy number aberration (CNA) and gene sequencing analyses on a cohort of CLL patients with 11q- in order to identify subgroups with potential prognostic relevance based on: i) the inclusion of BIRC3 in the deleted region; ii) the presence of BIRC3 mutation; iii) the presence of other CNAs. Methods . The study has included 55 untreated CLL patients followed at our Institution or enrolled in GIMEMA clinical trials (2003-2013). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. CNA analysis was performed by genomic hybridization on the CytoScan HD array (Affymetrix), which contains more than 2.6 x 10 6 markers for copy number analysis and 750.000 SNPs. Data were analyzed using both Partek Genomics Suite and ChAS (Chromosome Analysis Suite, Affymetrix) software. The resulting CNAs were verified by visual examination of the plotted copy number profiles. BIRC3 mutations (exons 6-9) were evaluated by Sanger sequencing. Time to first treatment (TFT) was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of first therapy or last follow-up; progression-free survival (PFS) from the date of first therapy to the date of progression, death or last follow-up. Results. Baseline characteristics of the 55 cases were as follows: median age at diagnosis 59 years (range 39-84), male gender in 81.8% of patients, progressive disease in 62%. All patients showed 11q- by FISH (median 80%, range 25-99% of nuclei); germline IGHV were present in 96.4% of cases; TP53 deletion in 1 case and TP53 mutation in none; NOTCH1 mutation in 4/40 cases; SF3B1 mutation in 5/40 (all mutually exclusive with only 1 case having both SF3B1 and BIRC3 mutations). By CytoScan HD array, the size of 11q- was very variable, ranging from 0.36 Mbp to 65.14 Mbp; the MDR was located on 11q22.3 region, encompassing 4 genes ( ACAT1 , ATM , CUL5 , NPAT ). BIRC3 was included in the deleted region in 45/55 cases (81.8%) and was mutated in 4/54 (7.5%), being always deleted on the other allele. Beside 11q-, 51 cases (92.7%) showed several additional CNAs (average 4.9, range 1-14 per patient), with 5 recurrent lesions: 2p gain in 11 cases, del4(p15.2) in 6, del19(p13.3) in 6, 8q gain in 5 and del4(q22.1) in 4. BIRC3 deletion was not associated to the number of additional CNAs nor to specific CNA. After a follow-up of 59.6 months (range 7.4-229.7), 40 of 47 evaluable patients have received treatment (median TFT 15.8 months, range 0-167). BIRC3 deleted cases (n=37) showed a TFT not significantly different from WT cases (n=10). Conversely, BIRC3 mutation was associated to a shorter TFT (p <0.0001), 0.5 vs 19.3 months of WT cases. Notably, 3/4 cases with the biallelic BIRC3 disruption had a marked hyperleukocytosis at diagnosis (212.4-302.8 x 10 9 L). The presence of additional CNAs was associated to a shorter, though not significant, TFT considering either >3 CNAs larger than 5 Mb (n=14) or >10 CNAs (n=5), or the presence of 2p gain, del4(p15.2), del19(p13.3) or 8q gain. So far, 22 patients have been evaluated for PFS after first-line therapy (median 28.7 months). BIRC3 deleted cases (n=17) were not associated to a shorter PFS compared to WT cases (n=5), in line with the results from Rose-Zerilli et al (Haematologica 2014). Conclusions . Among CLL with 11q-: 1) BIRC3 deletion involves more than 80% of cases, whilst the mutation is rare (7.5%); 2) BIRC3 deletion is not associated to a higher genomic complexity; 3) BIRC3 deletion does not seem to influence TFT or PFS of 11q- CLL; 4) BIRC3 mutation is strongly associated to a short TFT; 5) BIRC3 biallelic lesions can be associated to a marked hyperleucocytosis at diagnosis and immediate need of treatment.
