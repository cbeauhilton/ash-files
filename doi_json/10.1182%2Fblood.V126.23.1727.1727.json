    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND The Fc\u03b3 receptor IIb (Fc\u03b3RIIb) is an inhibitory Fc\u03b3 receptor that suppresses B-cell activation when coligated with B-cell antigen receptor (BCR). Previous studies from our group indicate that the ability of the Fc\u03b3RIIb to inhibit BCR signaling after coligation is attenuated in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Furthermore, in contrast to what has been described in normal murine B-cells, stimulation of the Fc\u03b3RIIb alone induces proliferation of CLL cells. However, the correlation between Fc\u03b3RIIb expression, immunophenotypic characteristics, and clinical variables in patients with CLL has not been studied. AIM The aim of this study was to correlate the expression of Fc\u03b3RIIb on leukemic cells from previously untreated CLL patients and its immunophenotypic features and clinical parameters. METHODS The study population included 112 patients with untreated CLL for whom cryopreserved peripheral blood samples were available before treatment. The diagnosis was based on IWCLL 2008 criteria. The median patients' follow up was 57.92 months (range: 2.23-439.78 months). Fc\u03b3RIIb expression levels were determined by flow cytometry on CD5+/CD19+ CLL cells using a specific Alexa488-conjugated murine mAb specific for human Fc\u03b3RIIb. The following combinations were assessed: Fc\u03b3RIIb/CD38/CD19/CD5, Fc\u03b3RIIb/CD49d/CD19/CD5, and Fc\u03b3RIIb/CD69/CD19/CD5. Results were expressed as the ratio between the MFI for Fc\u03b3RIIb and the MFI for the corresponding isotype (MFIR). Fc\u03b3RIIb expression levels were correlated with: i) expression of CD49d, CD38 and CD69, ii) clinico-biological characteristics, and iii) clinical outcome. Differences of Fc\u03b3RIIb expression on dichotomized clinicopathological variables were assessed with Mann Whitney test. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analysis were performed to evaluate the correlation of Fc\u03b3RIIb expression with clinical outcome. Best cut-offs for overall survival (OS) and treatment-free survival (TFS) were determined by ROC curves. RESULTS All CD5+CD19+ leukemic cells samples expressed Fc\u03b3RIIb. However, Fc\u03b3RIIb expression levels markedly varied between patients (median MFIR: 45.8; interquartile range: 14.9-76.6; 5 th -95 th percentile: 17.15-111.4). Fc\u03b3RIIb expression was significantly higher in patients who had high (\u226530%) CD49d expression than in those with low (<30%) CD49d expression ( p =0.009). No correlation was observed between Fc\u03b3RIIb expression and age, disease stage, IGHV mutational status or chromosomal abnormalities analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, ZAP70 and CD38. Furthermore, within individual clones, Fc\u03b3RIIb expression levels were higher on CD38+ or CD49d+ cells than on CD38- or CD49d- cells, respectively (median MFIR: 49.05 vs. 36.72, p =0.001 for CD38+ vs . CD38- cells; and 58.87 vs. 35.55, p <0.001 for CD49d+ vs . CD49d- cells). In univariate analysis, low Fc\u03b3RIIb expression levels (MFIR< 26.67) were associated with shorter OS (HR 4.01, 95%CI 1.15-13.90, p=0.029), together with older age, advanced stage, and expression of CD38 and CD49d. Advanced stage, unmutated IGHV , and CD38, CD49d and ZAP-70 expression were also associated significantly with shorter TFS. Thus, patients with higher levels of Fc\u03b3RIIb had better survival than those with lower levels (Log rank test, p = 0.018). A multivariate analysis adjusted for Fc\u03b3RIIb expression, age, disease stage, CD38, and CD49d identified older age (\u226565 yrs) (HR 150.76, 95%CI 5.39-4212.42, p =0.003), low Fc\u03b3RIIb expression (HR 111.91, 95%CI 6.71-1866.97, p =0.001), advanced stage (B/C) (HR 17.44, 95%CI 1.45-210.24, p =0.024) and CD38 expression (HR 5.02, 95%CI 1.01-25.18, p =0.050) as independent predictors for shorter OS. CONCLUSIONS In this study, Fc\u03b3RIIb expression on leukemic cells from untreated patients with CLL was found to be an independent prognostic marker for OS, overcoming the prognostic value of CD49d, which is consistent with the key role of the Fc\u03b3RIIb in the pathogenesis of CLL. Further analysis aimed at validating this observation and to better understand the functional cooperation of Fc\u03b3RIIb with other molecules, particularly CD49d, are warranted. These studies could open a new venue in CLL treatment. Disclosures Gorlatov: MacroGenics: Employment. Sierra: Novartis: Research Funding; Celgene: Research Funding; Amgen: Research Funding."
