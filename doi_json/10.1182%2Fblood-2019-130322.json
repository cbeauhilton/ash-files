    "abstract_text": "Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is one of the most common clonal malignant diseases in children, and it stems from unchecked proliferation of lymphoid progenitor cells. Glucocorticoids (GCs) such as prednisolone and dexamethasone are used as a chemotherapeutic drug in the treatment of ALL. GC-induced cell mortality is first mediated by the activation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), followed by its translocation into the nucleus to activate or inhibit gene transcription. However, up to ~20% patients with leukemia relapse and become resistant to GCs. Therefore, a better understanding the molecular basis of chemoresistance in ALL would provide novel therapeutic opportunities for patients. Methods: By analyzing the published mRNA expression profiles (GSE5280; GSE94302) obtained from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), we found that higher expression of ANXA1 was significantly associated with decreased overall survival of ALL patients. We also examined the expression of ANXA1 at mRNA and protein levels in a variety of ALL cell lines by using qRT-PCR and western blot analyses. The mRNA and protein expression of ANXA1 in ALL cell lines and patients were determined using Real-time PCR and Western blot respectively. Functional assays, such as CCK-8, FACS, and Tunel assay used to determine the oncogenic role of ANXA1 in ALL progression. Furthermore, western blotting and luciferase assay were used to determine the mechanism of ANXA1 promotes chemoresistance in ALL cells. Results: The expression of ANXA1 was markedly upregulated in ALL cell lines and patients, and high ANXA1 expression was associated with relapsed/refractory ALL patients. ANXA1 overexpression confers glucocorticoids (GCs) resistance on ALL cells; however, down-regulated of ANXA1 sensitized ALL cell lines to GC both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, ANXA1 upregulated the levels of FPRs by promoting Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling. Conclusions: Our findings provided evidence that ANXA1 is a potential therapeutic target for patients with ALL. Targeting ANXA1 signaling may be a promising strategy to enhance GC response during ALL chemo-resistance. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
