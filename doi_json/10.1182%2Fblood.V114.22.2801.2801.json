    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2801 Poster Board II-777 To provide a rationale basis for targeted drug development for multiple myeloma patients, we have conducted high-throughput genome-scale RNA interference (RNAi) synthetic lethality studies in human myeloma cell lines (HMCL) to generate a comprehensive map of critical genes and molecular vulnerabilities in human myeloma tumor cells. KMS11 human myeloma cells were screened with a 13,982-oligo library targeting the \u2018druggable' genome (6,991 genes) using optimized conditions that resulted in >95% transfection efficiency. Each gene was screened with 2 or more distinct oligos, in duplicate, using a single-siRNA-per-well format, testing >34,000 wells. Replicate high throughput experiments yielded highly reproducible results (R 2 =0.82). Viability was measured at 96h by ATP-dependent luminescence. Universally lethal siRNA and non-targeted siRNA were employed as controls. The specificity (FDR) of lethal RNAi was evaluated by custom-developed statistical methods based on RNAi result concordancy. From screening, 5.8% of druggable genome siRNA caused statistically relevant reductions in HMCL viability (greater than three standard deviations from control samples treated with non-silencing siRNA, compared with an anticipated rate due to chance of only 0.135%). Of these, two hundred and nineteen genes, targeted by the most lethal siRNA, were forwarded to validation studies. Validation high-throughput RNAi studies, using 4 oligos per gene, were conducted in order to verify target gene vulnerability. Ultimately, seventy two genes were validated as highly critical for myeloma cell survival (each with multiple concordant siRNA hits plus high reproducibility of R 2 =0.94). Among top-ranked lethal molecular vulnerabilities in KMS11 myeloma cells we recurrently identified the proteasome (8 PSM subunits were independently identified as highly vulnerable); and BCL2 family member MCL1; both known therapeutic targets, validating a functional genomics approach to target discovery. In addition, a number of novel, equally lethal, molecular vulnerabilities were identified in KMS11 including WEE1, kinetochore complex component KNTC2, the aurora kinases, polo-like kinase 1, a previously uncharacterized DNA methyl transferase, ribonucleotide reductase, ribosomal protein L38, leptin receptor overlapping transcript LEPROT and SLC25A23 (a carrier responsible for mitochondrial adenine nucleotide flux). Various ubiquitous cellular proteins involved in RNA or protein processing (e.g. SF3a, SNW1, SNRPA1, EIF3s8, amongst others) were also identified as non redundant and critical for cellular viability. Thirty nine top-ranked molecular vulnerabilities in KMS11 were evaluated for comparative vulnerability in a second myeloma cell line, JJN3, and in A549 and 293 epithelial cells. A majority were vulnerable in JJN3. While 25 genes proved equally lethal on silencing in A549 and 293 epithelial cells, several, notably including MCL1 and three proteasome subunits, appear differentially susceptible in myeloma cells versus epithelial cells. From this genome scale study, MCL1 ranks third as a target capable of inducing cell death in myeloma cells, highlighting the potent vulnerability of myeloma cell viability to alterations in this anti-apoptosis regulator. Moreover, from active comparative studies of molecular vulnerability in myeloma versus epithelial cell lines, MCL1 as an RNAi target demonstrates perhaps the greatest cytotoxic selectivity between myeloma and epithelial cell lines of all targets examined. Gene expression studies indicate that MCL1 is highly expressed in myeloma tumor cells but is absent or only weakly expressed in human primary somatic tissues. Overall, therefore, from an unsupervised genome-scale screening approach, our data support MCL1 as an optimal Achilles heel molecular target in multiple myeloma, potentially offering greater specificity and deeper cytotoxic effect than proteasome inhibition.
