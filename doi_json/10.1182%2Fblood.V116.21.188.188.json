    "abstract_text": "Abstract 188 Background/Aim: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a common and potentially fatal complication of major abdominal surgery. Semuloparin is a novel ultra-low-molecular-weight heparin (ULMWH) with high anti-factor Xa and residual anti-factor IIa activities currently under development for prevention of VTE. We have conducted a study to assess the efficacy and safety of semuloparin compared to enoxaparin for the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Material and methods: SAVE-ABDO is a multinational, randomized, double-blind phase III study of patients undergoing major abdominal or pelvic operation. Patients were randomized to receive either once-daily enoxaparin 40 mg commenced pre-operatively or semuloparin 20 mg commenced post-operatively, both agents continued for 7\u201310 days. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged > 60 years, had undergone major surgery in the peritoneal or the retroperitoneal space, and/or pelvis under general anesthesia lasting more than 45 minutes. For patients under the age of 60 years old, an additional risk factor (history of VTE, body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , chronic heart failure, chronic respiratory failure, inflammatory bowel disease, or operation for malignancy) was required. For patients with severe renal impairment, defined as a creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, the dose of semuloparin was reduced to 10 mg once-daily, and that of enoxaparin to 20 mg once-daily. Randomization was stratified by indication for operation (cancer versus non-cancer), renal function (creatinine clearance \u2265 or < 30 mL/min), and geographic region. Mandatory bilateral venography was performed between day 7 and 11. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of any deep vein thrombosis (DVT), non-fatal pulmonary embolism (PE), and all-cause mortality. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the composite of any VTE and VTE-related mortality, and the composite of any proximal DVT, symptomatic distal DVT, non-fatal pulmonary embolism, and all-cause mortality. The main safety endpoint was major bleeding, with main secondary safety endpoints of clinically-relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding, and the composite of major and CRNM bleeding. All study endpoints were independently and blinded adjudicated. The non-inferiority will be reached if the upper limit of the confidence interval of the odds ratio for the primary analysis is < 1.25. If the non-inferiority is demonstrated the superiority will be tested using a stratified exact test on the primary efficacy endpoint. Results : 4414 patients were randomized between May 2008 and June 2010. The mean age was 61 years (\u00b113 years) and 57% of subjects were male. 81% of patients underwent an operation for malignant disease. The majority of patients underwent gastro-intestinal procedures, with 59% having colon or colo-rectal surgery, and 20% gastric surgery. Final data will be available for presentation at the meeting.
