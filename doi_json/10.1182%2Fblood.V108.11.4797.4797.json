    "abstract_text": "Objective and methods: More than 90% of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients have the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome which produces a specific oncoprotein known as BCR/ABL (P210 protein). Having strong tyrosine kinase activity, the BCR/ABL oncoprotein can trigger several signal transduction pathways and inhibit the normal signal transduction pathways of CML progenitor cells. Presenting on cell surface, Integrins belong to the adhesive molecule family. They mediate adhesion of cell to cell or cell to extra cellular matrix (ECM) and take part in many physiological and pathological processes such as signaling transduction, cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Many studies showed that abnormal circulating of CML Ph + cells in peripheral blood and unregulated proliferation of CML Ph + cells in bone marrow were related closely to the abnormal adhesion function of integrins. It is also well known that Interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 is one of the effective therapeutic agents for CML. Therefore the present study was designed, by cell culture, FCM, RT-PCR and Western Blot, to observe the effects of IFN\u03b1-2b on the proliferation of k562 cells and fresh leukemia cells from patients with CML-in blast crisis (CML cells), before and after integrin \u03b15\u03b21 having been neutralized by Anti-integrin \u03b15\u03b21 monoclonal antibody (Anti-\u03b15\u03b21), and to investigate the changes of mRNA and protein of several key molecules in integrin-mediated pathways, such as FAK, ERK, AKT, PI3K and Cychin D1, p21 and survivin before and after the treatment of Anti-\u03b15\u03b21 with or without IFN\u03b1-2b. Results: The expression level of integrin \u03b15\u03b21 on K562 cells and CML cells was much higher than that on health volunteers\u2019 BMMNC. And the adhesion capability of K562 cells and CML cells to fibronectin (FN) decreased significantly than that of health volunteers\u2019 BMMNC. IFN\u03b1-2b improved the adhesion capability of K562 cells and CML cells to FN. Anti-\u03b15\u03b21 inhibited proliferation but induced apoptosis and G 0 /G 1 arresting of K562 cells and CML cells. Anti-\u03b15\u03b21 downregulated the expression level of p-FAK-, p-ERK-, PI3K- and p-AKT-mRNA and protein. Anti-\u03b15\u03b21 also downregulated the expression level of Cyclin D1 mRNA, but upregulated the expression level of P21 mRNA. Moreover, the effect of Anti-\u03b15\u03b21 is stronger than that of IFN\u03b1-2b. Conclusions: Anti-\u03b15\u03b21 inhibited integrin \u03b15\u03b21-mediated signal transduction pathways: FAK-ras-ERK pathway and PI3K-AKT-survivin pathway. This might be the mechanisms of Anti-\u03b15\u03b21 inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of K562 cellsand CML cells. This indicated that the dysfunction of integrin \u03b15\u03b21 pathway might have important meanings in the leukemogenesis of CML and might become a new target for the treatment of CM.",
