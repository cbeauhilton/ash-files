    "abstract_text": "IL-34 is a newly identified cytokine that binds to the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R), promotes monocyte viability, and stimulates macrophage colony formation ( Lin et al., 2008 ). Here we demonstrate that human IL-34 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the CSF-1R in cells of a mouse MacCsf1r\u2212/\u2212.huCSF-1R macrophage line. MacCsf1r\u2212/\u2212.huCSF-1R cells were obtained by retroviral transduction of the human CSF-1R into cells of the MacCsf1r\u2212/\u2212 macrophage line ( Yu et al., 2008 ) derived from bone marrow macrophages isolated from a CSF-1R-deficient mouse. In addition, IL-34 stimulated the downstream signaling of ERK1/2 and the IL-34-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was blocked by a CSF-1R-specific inhibitor. IL-34, in synergy with RANK ligand, promoted formation of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive and multinucleated osteoclasts from monocytes in dose-dependent manner. The activity of IL-34 on osteoclast differentiation was inhibited by the soluble CSF-1R extracellular domain. Therefore, IL-34 functions as a new ligand of CSF-1R and participates in the regulation of osteoclast development.",
