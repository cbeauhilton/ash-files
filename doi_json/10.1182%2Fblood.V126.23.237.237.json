    "abstract_text": "During arterial haemostasis, platelets tether to and translocate on disrupted vascular surface via binding of GPIb\u03b1 to the VWF A1 domain, which triggers activation signals that induce intracellular Ca 2+ release and up-regulate integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 binding capacity 1 , 2 . Inhibition of this signaling pathway or blockade of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 binding has a devastating impact on platelet firm adhesion and aggregate formation 1 , 3 , 4 . We used a newly developed switch biomembrane force probe (BFP) assay to characterize the cooperativity between GPIb\u03b1 and \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 on single-molecular level. VWF-A1 and fibronectin fragment (FN III7-10 ) were separately coated on two different probes, enabling controlled presentation of two ligands in separate space and time (Fig. A). Pulling GPIb\u03b1 by A1 on the first probe with a durable force activated the discoid platelet (Fig. A, upper panel), as revealed by an intracellular calcium flux. Upon switching to the FN III7-10 -bearing bead, the A1-triggered platelet was interrogated for the activity of its surface \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 (Fig. A, lower panel). A 25-pN force of >2s duration on a single GPIb\u03b1-A1 bond was found to activate \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 into an intermediate affinity state, as reflected by a ~30% adhesion frequency with a FN III7-10 bead, significantly higher than binding to low affinity \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 on platelets without A1-triggering but much lower than binding to high affinity \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 on platelets pre-incubated with ADP or thrombin (Fig. B), two strong platelet-activating agonists. This submaximal activation agreed with the previous immuno-staining findings 2 . \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 activation and outside-in signaling require the sequential engagement of talin and G\u03b1 13 to \u03b2 3 cytoplasmic tail, respectively 5 , 6 . Blocking G\u03b1 13 -\u03b2 3 engagement by a synthetic peptide mP 6 (gift from Xiaoping Du, UIC) 6 had no effect on FN III7-10 binding of resting and A1-triggered platelets, but significantly suppressed the FN III7-10 binding of platelets pre-incubated with ADP or thrombin by lowering their adhesion frequencies to a level comparable with A1-triggered platelets (Fig. B). The control peptide mP 6 Scr showed no effect on the ADP or thrombin stimulated platelets (Fig. B). In addition to binding affinity, bond lifetimes were measured by force-clamp experiment. Platelets with no treatment, A1 triggering and ADP stimulation formed \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 -FN III7-10 (Fig. C) and \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 -fibrinogen (Fig. D) bonds with short, intermediate and long lifetimes, respectively. Interactions with fibrinogen exhibited catch-slip bonds regardless of the \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 affinity state. By comparison, only high affinity \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 exhibited a catch-slip bond with FN III7-10 as slip-only bonds were observed for FN III7-10 interactions with intermediate and low affinity \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 . These data suggest the existence of three distinct integrin states that correspond to the three affinities and force-dependent bond lifetime patterns, in which the intermediate state was induced by the GPIb\u03b1 mechanotransduction (Fig. E). G\u03b1 13 engagement was not required for the intermediate state, but necessary for the high affinity state (Fig. E). References: 1. Nesbitt, W. S. et al.
