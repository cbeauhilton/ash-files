    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4723 In our study, 26 BM species from 23 normal karyotypic acute leukemia patients (non-APL) with NPM + and FLT3-ITD - gene mutation were collected in our department. Compared to healthy controls, SENP1, HIF-1alpha and VEGF mRNA expression in ALL and AML patients were elevated to 10.0, 13.2, 16.6 and 43.1, 97.75, 240.0 folds, respectively, by RT-real time PCR. The levels of SENP1, HIF-1\u03b1and VEGF mRNA in AML patients were greatly higher than those in ALL ( p <0.05). SENP1 and HIF-1alpha expression levels were positively and significantly correlated (linear regression analysis, r = 0.88, p <0.05) both in ALL and AML. The correlation between HIF-1alpha and VEGF mRNA level was statistically significant (linear regression analysis, r = 0.34, p <0.05). Among AML patients, SENP1, HIF-1alpha and VEGF gene expressive level in non-response (NR) patients (n=7) were higher than patients with CR (n=9), p <0.01. For ALL patients, the expressive level (\u2018X\u00b1S) of SENP1, HIF-1alpha, VEGF gene in NR(n=3)were slightly higher than those in CR (n=4): 10.5\u00b12.7, 6.8\u00b13.4; 13.2\u00b116.6, 3.9\u00b13.0; 13.1\u00b110.1,11.1\u00b112.1. Elevated gene expression of SENP1, HIF-1alpha and VEGF indicate shorter survival time of patients, p <0.01.The levels of SENP1, HIF-1alpha and VEGF gene decreased after treatment in 3 AML patients. Thus, higher SENP1, HIF-1alpha and VEGF gene levels might be associated with shortened survival and worse clinical process. Therefore, although higher expression of SENP1, HIF-1alpha and VEGF gene might throw an impact on the prognostic prediction in acute leukemia patients, confirmation of this hypothesis need to be done in more large population.
