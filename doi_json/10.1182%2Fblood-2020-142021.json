    "abstract_text": "Background: Advances in medical care have resulted in nearly 95% of all children with sickle cell disease (SCD) living to adulthood. Standardized transition programming does not currently exist, resulting in high rates of mortality and morbidity among young adults (YA) during the transition period. Mentoring and social support have been used to impact health behavior change. Medical student mentors can serve as mentors offering specialized support for YA. This study examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a medical student mentor intervention to improve transition outcomes for YAs with SCD. Methods: 24 YA with sickle cell disease and 9 medical student mentors enrolled in the intervention. Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention was assessed through enrollment rates, reasons for refusal, retention rates, engagement with the intervention, satisfaction, and reasons for drop-out. The preliminary efficacy of the intervention among patient participants was assessed using dependent t-tests to evaluate changes in transition readiness, health related quality of life, self-efficacy, SCD knowledge medication adherence, and health literacy. Among medical student mentor participants, changes in attitudes towards chronic illness and SCD knowledge were explored. Results: Patient participants demonstrated adequate enrollment (63.2%), retention (75.0%), and adherence to the intervention (88.3%) and rated the intervention components highly. Patient participants demonstrated significant improvements in transition readiness ( p = .001), self-efficacy ( p = .002), medication adherence ( p = .02), and health literacy ( p = .05). Medical students also demonstrated significant improvements in SCD knowledge ( p = .01). Discussion: A medical student mentor intervention to facilitate transition from pediatric to adult care for young adults with SCD is both feasible and acceptable to patients and medical students. Preliminary evidence suggests such an intervention may provide dual benefit for both patients and students. A randomized controlled trial is needed to evaluate efficacy.
