    "abstract_text": "Background. Splenectomy is the recommended treatment in adult patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who fail to respond to corticosteroid treatment or who require unacceptably high doses to maintain a safe platelet level. For these patients splenectomy may produce a good response in 60\u201380% of patients. However, the observation time after splenectomy has in most published studies been relatively short. Thus, the true long-term response to splenectomy still remains less well defined. The efficacy and safety of splenectomy were assessed in a cohort of adult ITP patients followed for a very long period of time. Patients and methods. The study included 59 ITP patients (M/F=25/34, median age at splenectomy; 39 yrs, range 14\u201375 yrs). The median time from diagnosis to splenectomy was 5.5 mos (range 0.4\u2013199 mos). Criteria used to define response to splenectomy were: CR; platelet count >150 x 10 9 /l lasting \u22654 weeks, PR; platelet count \u226550\u2013150 x 10 9 /l lasting \u22654 weeks and, NR; failure to achieve platelet counts \u226550 x 10 9 /l. The criterion for relapse in CR/PR patients was a decrease in platelet counts to <50 x 10 9 /l. Results. The median follow-up time after splenectomy was 18 yrs (range 2\u201332 yrs). No serious surgical complications occurred. The overall response rate was 78% with 59% CR and 19% PR. CR and PR patients were younger than NR patients at time of diagnosis (median age: 36 yrs vs 48 yrs, p=0.03) and at splenectomy (median age: 38 yrs vs 51 yrs, p=0.02). Among the 46 responding patients 17 eventually relapsed. A plateau in the progression free survival curve was identified after 12.1 and 7.3 years for patients in CR or PR, respectively.

Bacteremia was recorded in two patients during a total of 1023 patient years at risk. Conclusions We conclude that splenctomy is an effective and safe treatment in adult patients with chronic ITP failing to respond to corticosteroid treatment. The complication rate was low and our findings support the view that response to splenectomy is durable after a certain point in time.",
