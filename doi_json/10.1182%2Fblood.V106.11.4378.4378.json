    "abstract_text": "TRAIL initiates activation of Caspase-8, which is blocked by the FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIP), resulting in resistance to apoptosis. Here we show that overexpression of FLIP L and FLIP S in ML1 cells, with low constitutive levels of FLIP, protects these cells against apoptosis induced by TRAIL, not only via Caspase-8 inhibition, but also via upregulation of anti-apoptotic molecules. Methods: 1) Apoptosis was determined by Annexin V/ 7-AAD following treatment with TRAIL (100\u2013500ng/ml), or TNFa (20\u2013100ng/ml) in ML1 cells transduced with FLIP L .GFP (green fluorescent protein), FLIP S .GFP or Neo.GFP (control). 2) Caspase-8, Caspase-3, Bid, Bcl-xL, XIAP, phosphorylated (P)-IKBa and P-Akt were determined by western blots. 3) Active Caspase-3 was determined using EnzChek Caspase-3 assay kit. Results: Both FLIP L and FLIP S transduction protected ML1 cells against apoptosis induced by TRAIL (300ng/ml), while no protection was observed in Neo.GFP cells. FLIP L had a more profound protective effect than FLIP S (Fig.1A). Both FLIP L and FLIP S , but not Neo.GFP, blocked Caspase-8 and Caspase-3 activation (Fig.1B); FLIP S cells showed two-fold higher levels of active Caspase-3 than FLIP L cells, consistent with higher apoptosis in FLIP S cells. Caspase-3 can be activated through Caspase-8 (extrinsic pathway) or via Caspase-8/Bid (intrinsic pathway). The latter was responsible for high active Caspase-3 levels in FLIP S cells as shown by the presence of cleaved Bid (t-Bid) (Fig.1B); cleavage of Bid was inhibited by combination of TRAIL and Z-IETD-FMK (Caspase-8 inhibitor). Anti-apoptotic molecules, including Bcl-xL, XIAP and FLIP are regulated by NF-kB and FLIP participates in an NF-kB auto-amplification loop. While Neo.GFP cells showed little Bcl-xL after 4h of TRAIL exposure and there was a twofold reduction in FLIP S cells, only a slight reduction of Bcl-xL was noted in FLIP L cells. FLIP L cells showed the lowest rates of apoptosis when exposed to TNFa and BMS543541, a specific inhibitor of IkB kinase (Fig. 1C). In the presence of BMS543541, phosphorylation of IkBa and levels of Bcl-xL and XIAP decreased in Neo.GFP and FLIP S but not in FLIP L cells. Additional data suggest that the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway is involved in constitutive NF-kB activation and differentially affected by FLIP L and FLIP S (Fig. 1D). Preliminary results in immunodeficient mice transplanted with transduced ML1 cells indicated the in vivo relevance of the differences between FLIP L and FLIP S with FLIP L cells engrafting earlier and showing earlier signs of sickness. Conclusions: FLIP L and FLIP S conferred resistance to TRAIL induced apoptosis but showed differential effects: Caspase-8/Bid was involved in the apoptosis pathway in FLIP S , but not in FLIP L cells. FLIP L cells\u2019 resistance was due not only to caspase inhibition but to the recruitment of downstream anti-apoptotic pathways such as NF-kB and PI3K/Akt. In vivo data further substantiated the antiapoptotic/pro-survival behavior of FLIP L cells. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure  Close modal",
