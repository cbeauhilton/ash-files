Specific Aims To compare relapse rates following umaintained remissions exceeding 1 year in patients with ITP treated with steroids versus anti-Rh(D) with/without steroids versus rituximab with/without steroids. Methods Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. The charts of 52 consecutive patients with ITP followed in a hematology practice between 07/01/03 and 06/30/13 were reviewed. Remission was defined as a platelet count > 100,000/\u00b5L. Patients with the aforementioned treatment and remission characteristics were identified. Steroids were administered alone as dexamethasone 40 mg PO daily for 4 days. Anti-Rh(D) was administered as 75 mcg/kg IV with or without prednisone 60-85 mg PO daily tapered over 4 weeks or dexamethasone 40 mg PO daily for 4 days. Rituximab was administered as 375 mg/m2 IV weekly for 4 weeks or as a single dose with or without dexamethasone 40 mg PO daily for 4 days. Relapse was defined as a platelet count < 30,000/\u00b5L. Statistical calculations included ANOVA to compare demographics and chi-square contingency table analysis to compare distant relapse rates ( http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats ). Results There were 16 unmaintained remissions exceeding 1 year in 13 patients following treatment with steroids, anti-Rh(D) with/without steroids, or rituximab with/without steroids. Mean age on presentation, sex ratio, duration of ITP prior to therapy, and duration of follow-up after therapy were similar for the 3 groups ( Table 1 ).

Table 2 Distant relapse rates per treatment group   Steroids (n=2)  Anti-Rh(D) +/- steroids (n=8)  Rituximab +/- steroids (n=6)  P  With distant relapse (n) 2 1 4 0.03 Without distant relapse (n) 0 7 2   Steroids (n=2)  Anti-Rh(D) +/- steroids (n=8)  Rituximab +/- steroids (n=6)  P  With distant relapse (n) 2 1 4 0.03 Without distant relapse (n) 0 7 2  View Large Conclusion Among patients who achieve long unmaintained remissions of ITP with steroids, anti-Rh(D) with/without steroids, or rituximab with/without steroids, those treated with anti-Rh(D)-based therapy are the most likely to have extended remission.
