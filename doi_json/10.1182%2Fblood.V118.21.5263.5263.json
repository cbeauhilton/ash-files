    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5263 The Src family kinases (SFKs) play an essential role in collagen- and von Willebrand factor (vWF)-mediated platelet activation. However, the role of SFKs in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated platelet activation is not fully understood, and little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which SFKs are activated by GPCR stimulation. Here we demonstrate that SFKs are activated by the G q and G i pathways, respectively and SFKs play important roles in G q - and G i -dependent secretion and activation. ADP induced SFK phosphorylation in wild type and G q \u2212/\u2212 platelets, and ADP-induced SFK phosphorylation was inhibited by the P2Y 12 antagonist AR-C69931MX or P2Y 12 knockout but was not affected by the P2Y 1 antagonist MRS-2179. Lyn and Fyn were co-immunoprecipitated with G i2 in platelets, and ADP-induced SFK phosphorylation was diminished in Lyn \u2212/\u2212 platelets. These results demonstrate that ADP induces SFK activation mainly depending on the G i pathway activated via its receptor P2Y 12 . Furthermore, epinephrine also dose-dependently induced SFK phosphorylation in mouse platelets. A selective inhibitor of Src family kinase PP2 inhibited ADP-induced Akt phosphorylation, fibrinogen binding, and platelet aggregation. Thus, activation of G i is sufficient to induce SFK activation, which plays an important role in Gi-dependent platelet activation. We further show that the thrombin receptor PAR4 peptide AYPGKF elicited SFK phosphorylation in P2Y 12 \u2212/\u2212 , but not in G q \u2212/\u2212 platelets, and AYPGKF-induced SFK phosphorylation was inhibited by the calcium chelator dimethyl-BAPTA, suggesting that G q -dependent SFK phosphorylation is downstream from the Ca 2+ signaling. The calcium ionophore, A23187-induced TXA 2 synthesis, platelet aggregation and secretion were inhibited by pre-incubation of platelets with PP2. PAR4-induced TXA 2 synthesis was also abolished by PP2. Moreover, PAR4-mediated granule secretion, integrin a IIb b 3 activation, and aggregation of P2Y 12 deficient platelets were partially inhibited by PP2 or a PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220, but were completely abolished by Ro-31-8220 plus PP2 or dimethyl-BAPTA, suggesting that Ca 2+ /SFKs and PKC represent two parallel signaling pathways mediating G q -dependent platelet activation. In summary, SFKs can be activated by G q /Ca 2+ -dependent mechanisms and by G i -dependent mechanisms, and SFKS play important roles in G q - and G i -dependent platelet activation.
