    "abstract_text": "Background: The pathological behavior of Waldenstr\u00f6ms macroglobulinemia (WM) cells relies on aberrant B-cell receptor (BCR), and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and is intricately supported by malfunctions in initiation of apoptosis. In this dynamic, a complex shift between functionally active pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins from the Bcl-2 family occurs and bestows the malignant cells with a significant survival advantage. This defective apoptotic signaling is associated with aggressive clinical behavior, chemoresistance, and a poor prognosis in many B-cell cancers, including WM. Thus, BCR/TLR induced proliferation and abnormal apoptotic signaling due to dysregulation of Bcl-2 signaling, act in concert for the assurance of the malignant WM cells survival. Clinically, mitigation of BCR signaling with the first in class BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, has shown promising results in WM and other B-cell cancers. However, clinical responses to the BTK inhibitor alone are less than optimal and development of ibrutinib-resistant disease is being recognized as an important and impending dilemma. We have previously shown the utility of disrupting pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein interactions in WM, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma and that this functional interference results in re-sensitization (or heightened sensitivity) of tumor cells towards chemoimmunotherapy. As such, we examined the effects of ABT-199, a Bcl-2 specific small molecule inhibitor, in preclinical models of WM. Importantly; we conducted this investigation in proprietarily developed WM cells that have acquired resistance mechanisms towards either ibrutinib (IR WM subclones) or bortezomib (BR WM subclones). Materials: WM cell lines (BCWM.1, MWCL.1 and RPCI-WM1; WT cells) including their bortezomib resistant (BR) or ibrutinib resistant (IR) subclones were used in this study. Results: An initial comparison of Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, BCL-xL, A1 (anti-apoptotic members), Noxa, Puma, Bim (pro-apoptotic initiators) and Bak and Bax (pro-apoptotic effectors), revealed that BR WM cells express increased levels of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, particularly Bcl-2, relative to WT cells. Similarly, A1 and Bcl-2 levels were up regulated in IR cell lines suggesting that the Bcl-2 mediated survival pathway is involved in resistance to both bortezomib and ibrutinib. Cell growth (MTS) assays using ABT-199 indicated that both BR and IR cells were equally sensitivity to Bcl-2 inhibition, with an IC 50 ranging between 2 \u2013 4mM. ABT-199 induced a dose dependent increase in MOMP with concomitant induction of apoptotic cell death, the latter confirmed by observation of PARP-1 cleavage. ABT-199 induced an intrinsic apoptotic program with the activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3 in all the cells tested. This data indicated the Bcl-2 pathway as being relevant and essential in WM cell lines even under drug resistant conditions. To evaluate the priming effect of ABT-199 on bortezomib and ibrutinib induced cell death, MTS assays were performed with these drugs in presence of IC 25 concentrations of ABT-199. The addition of ABT-199 significantly reduced the IC 50 of both bortezomib and ibrutinib in WT, BR and IR cells. This suggested that re-sensitization of BR and IR cells towards either bortezomib or ibrutinib, respectively, was possible in presence of ABT-199. Further, combined addition of ABT-199 with bortezomib or ibrutinib showed synergistic cell death (combination index range: 0.004 \u2013 0.6, CalcuSyn, Biosoft UK) in BR or IR WM cells, respectively. Conclusion: Dysregulation of Bcl-2 signaling is associated with the pathogenesis and promotion of drug resistance in B-cell cancers, including WM. Our report is first to highlight in WM preclinically, the antiproliferative effect of disrupting Bcl-2, through use of ABT-199. Altogether, our data suggests that therapeutic interference of Bcl-2 function with ABT-199 complements the anti-WM activity of ibrutinib or bortezomib in a synergistic manner and can in fact restore sensitivity of either drug in WM cells that are resistant to proteasome or BTK inhibitors. Focused mRNA and protein profiling analyses are currently underway to delineate the mechanisms accounting for synergy observed between concomitant Bcl-2/BTK inhibition as well Bcl-2/proteasome inhibition.
