    "abstract_text": "Introduction: We have previously reported that treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell lymphoma with the pan-class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor copanlisib resulted in durable responses with a manageable safety profile (Dreyling et al., J Clin Oncol 35:3898-3905, 2017). The objective response rate was 59%. In contrast with oral PI3K inhibitors, there was also a low incidence of severe adverse events, such as pneumonitis and colitis with copanlisib, possibly due to intravenous dosing and intermittent dose schedule. Because late-onset severe toxicities have been reported with chronic use of some oral PI3K inhibitors, we conducted a 2-year follow-up of the efficacy and safety from this study. Methods: Patients with histologically confirmed indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (4 subtypes: follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone (MZL), small lymphocytic and lymphoplasmacytoid / Waldenstr\u04e7m macroglobulinemia) and relapsed after, or refractory to, \u22652 prior lines of treatment were eligible. Previous treatment had to include rituximab and an alkylating agent or regimen. Copanlisib was administered at a fixed dose of 60 mg via 1-hour I.V. infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Treatment continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) after \u22654 cycles as assessed per independent radiologic review (Cheson et al., JCO 20:579, 2007). Secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Adverse events were reported using MedDRA (version 19.1). The last patient was enrolled in February 2016. The initial data cut-off was June 2016 and the long-term follow up is based on a February 2018 data cut-off. Results: A total of 142 patients were treated; the predominant histologies were FL (n=104) and MZL (n=23). The median age was 63 years (range 25-82). Median number of prior lines of treatment was 3 (range 2-9), with 61% being refractory to the last regimen. As of February 2018, the median duration of treatment was 6.0 months (range 0.2-44). The ORR was 61% (Table). CRs were seen in 24 patients (17%), 21 in the FL subset (20.2%) and 3 in the MZL group. The 24 CRs represent an increase of 7 compared to the original primary analysis. Median DOR was 14.1 months (95% CI 8.3; 22.3). With 72 events, the median PFS was 12.5 months (95% CI 9.0; 18.4) and with a total of 52 events the median OS was 42.6 months (95% CI 36.5; not reached). At the data cut-off, 11 patients (9 FL, 2 MZL) remained on treatment (range 24.8-43.9 months). A total of 38 patients (26.8%) had discontinued due an adverse event (AE) not associated with disease progression. Treatment-related AEs leading to dose reductions or dose interruptions were recorded in 36 (25.4%) and 72 (50.7%) patients, respectively. With a median safety follow up of 6.7 months, the most common treatment-emergent AEs (all-grade/grade 3/grade 4) were transient hyperglycemia (50.0%/33.1%/7%) and transient hypertension (29.6%/23.9% G3). Other AEs of interest included neutropenia (28.9%/9.2%/14.8%), diarrhea (35.2%/8.5% G3), pneumonitis (6.3%/1.4% G3), and colitis (one patient with G4). Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 55.6% of patients, with 31.7% G3 and 12% G4. (Corresponding SAEs from June 2016 were 50% all-grade, 27.5% G3 and 10.6% G4.) There were no new reports of G5 AEs . Conclusions: Analysis of the 2-year follow up of patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell lymphoma treated with copanlisib demonstrated a deepening of the responses with a conversion of 7 patients from PR to CR, durable responses and manageable AEs. Moreover, the benefit/risk ratio for copanlisib treatment remains favorable with no evidence of worsening of AEs for patients treated long-term.
