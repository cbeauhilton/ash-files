    "abstract_text": "In vitro studies have suggested that AML cells are sensitive to treatment with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, rapamycin. In particular, mTOR inhibition is known to enhance the sensitivity of primary AML cells and AML stem cells to etoposide based chemotherapy leading to inhibition of leukemic SRC activity in NOD/SCID mice. To determine the feasibility of applying this approach in vivo, we performed a Phase I dose escalation study of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus (rapamycin) with a combination chemotherapy induction regimen in adults with relapsed or refractory non-M3 AML. The purpose of this trial was to determine the safety and dose limiting toxicities of sirolimus and chemotherapy in this patient population. Patients received a loading dose of oral sirolimus on day 1 followed 24 hours later by daily doses of oral sirolimus on days 2\u20137 plus MEC (mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2/day IV, etoposide 100 mg/m2/day IV, and cytarabine 1000 mg/m2/day IV) on days 1\u20135. Five sirolimus dose levels were explored by a standard 3+3 design. Sirolimus was studied at loading doses from 3\u201315 mg and daily doses from 1\u20135 mg/d. Clinical response was assessed by bone marrow biopsy upon hematologic recovery or day 42, whichever occurred first. 23 adults (14 women, 9 men) of median age 58 (range 22 to 65) with relapsed, refractory, or secondary AML were treated with sirolimus and MEC. Five subjects had antecedent hematologic disorders or prior leukemogenic chemotherapy, 18 had relapsed or refractory disease. Sirolimus was well tolerated and did not increase non-hematologic toxicity of MEC chemotherapy. Asymptomatic, reversible liver transaminase or bilirubin elevations occurred in 4 patients, two of which were > grade 2. One patient with a history of prior cytarabine cerebellar toxicity (unknown at the time of study entry) developed reversible cerebellar ataxia. Three patients died of complications related to bacterial infections during chemotherapy-induced aplasia. Dose limiting toxicity was prolonged myelosuppression at the highest planned dose level and was responsible for one treatment-related death due to infectious complications from unresolved aplasia on study day 119. For the first four dose levels the median time to ANC recovery >500/uL among evaluable patients was 27 days (range16\u201338). Pharmacokinetic data showed that doses of 3 mg and higher consistently achieved rapamycin levels considered therapeutic in solid organ transplantation (4\u20139.2 ug/L). Bone marrow studies in 2/2 evaluable patients on dose level 4 (12 mg loading dose and 4 mg per day sirolimus) showed inhibition of p70S6 kinase phosphorylation consistent with effective inhibition of mTOR at this dose level. Complete remissions occurred in four patients, all treated for first relapse. Two patients subsequently proceeded to allogeneic transplantation. These results indicate that the combination of mTOR inhibition and chemotherapy is feasible in human AML and establish an appropriate dose for phase II studies to be 12mg loading dose followed by 4 mg daily. Patient recruitment at this dose is ongoing. Confirmation of the efficacy of this regimen, which targets signal transduction in leukemic < stem cells, is planned in a randomized phase II trial at the cooperative group level.",
