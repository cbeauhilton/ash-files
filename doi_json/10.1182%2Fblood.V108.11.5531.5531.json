    "abstract_text": "Background: Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with potent activity against many Gram-positive organisms. Efficacy in immunocompromised patients is unknown because these patients have been excluded from daptomycin premarketing studies. Methods: Patients with documented infections treated at the University of Michigan Health System in either the bone marrow transplant or hematology/oncology service were identified in the Cubicin\u00ae Outcomes Registry and Experience (CORE sm 2004 and 2005). Demographic, disease state, clinical, and microbiologic data were collected. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the following definitions: Cure - clinical signs and symptoms are resolved and/or no additional antibiotic therapy is necessary or infection cleared with a negative culture reported at the end of daptomycin therapy; Improved - partial resolution of clinical signs and symptoms and/or additional antibiotic therapy is necessary at the end of daptomycin therapy; Failure - inadequate response to therapy or resistant, worsening or new/recurrent signs and symptoms, or the need for a change in antibiotic therapy or a positive culture reported at the end of daptomycin therapy; Nonevaluable - unable to determine response at the end of daptomycin therapy. Success was defined as cure or improved. Results: Fourteen patients are included in this analysis. Nine (64%) patients were female; 6 (43%) were \u2265 51 years of age. Two patients had an initial CrCl <30 mL/min, 1 was on hemodialysis. Eight (57%) patients had undergone allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation primarily for acute myeloid leukemia. The remaining 6 patients had papillary adenocarcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, acute lymphoblastic lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. The most common infection (n=11, 79%) was bacteremia; 7 (50%) patients had catheter-related bacteremia; 1 each (7%) had discitis, necrotizing fasciitis and urinary tract infection. Nine (64%) patients had vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) as a pathogen; 8 were bacteremic (3 with concurrent coagulase-negative staphylococci; CoNS). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was isolated in 3 (21%) patients; 2 were bacteremic (1 with concurrent CoNS). One additional patient had CoNS bacteremia. The patient with necrotizing fasciitis was culture negative. The initial daptomycin dose was 4 mg/kg in 8 (57%) patients and 6 mg/kg in 6 (43%) patients. All patients receiving 6 mg/kg were bacteremic. The dosing frequency was adjusted for renal function in all patients. The median duration of therapy was 14.5 days (range, 2 \u2013 62). Nine (64%) patients received an antibiotic prior to daptomycin and 43% of patients received an antibiotic concomitantly. Seven catheters were removed; 5 from patients with catheter-related bacteremia. The median time to clinical response was 2 days (n=10, range 1 \u2013 13). All patients with an outcome reported (n=11) were successfully treated, 3 (21%) patients were nonevaluable. Of the 11 bacteremic patients, 5 received 4 mg/kg and 6 received 6 mg/kg; 2 were nonevaluable (both 6 mg/kg) and 9 of 11 (82%) were successes. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that daptomycin therapy is associated with clinical success in hem/onc patients including those who have undergone allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation where bacteremia and VRE are prevalent."
