    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3213 Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) includes a variety of hematologic disorders characterized by severe neutropenia, with absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) below 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and associated with severe systemic bacterial infections from early infancy. Mutations in ELANE , HAX1 , G6PC3 , WAS and GFI1 have been so far identified in patients with SCN. The Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) has collected data to monitor the clinical course, treatments, and disease outcomes for SCN patients. In this study, we analyzed the clinical and genetic characteristics of patients with SCN based on the Japanese cohort study collecting the data on chronic neutropenia using a standardized case report form. This study is approved by the ethics committees of the Hiroshima University School of Medicine. Forty-six patients with SCN in Japan were enrolled in this study. Mean present age of patients was 13.6 years old ranged from 1 to 39. The Mean age at diagnosis was 4.6 months ranged from 0 to 24 months. Approximately 90% of patients were diagnosed before 12 months. Twenty-three patients were female. As initial clinical presentation, subcutaneous abscess and cutaneous cellulitis were dominated (37%), followed by unknown fever (17%), stomatitis (13%) and lymphadenitis (13%). On the other hand, infections which patients had experienced after diagnosis were bacterial pneumonia (50%), cutaneous infections (50%) and oral infections such as stomatitis (48%) and gingivitis (48 %). Total 8 patients (17%) including 4 patients with mutations in HAX1 suffered from psychomotor retardation that was higher than that in general Japanese population (about 1%), suggesting that psychomotor retardation may be one of considerable complications in patients with SCN. Thirty-three out of 46 patients with SCN were preformed gene analysis and 29 patients (approximately 88 %) were identified mutations; 25 patients had heterozygous mutations in ELAN E, 4 patients had homozygous mutations in HAX1 . The proportion of mutations in ELANE (76%) was higher and that in HAX1 (12%) was relatively lower in Japan compared with those in Western counties. Thirty-six patients (78%) were treated with G-CSF, including regular use in 26 patients (56%) and on demand use during infections in 10 patients (22%). In 26 patients treated with regular G-CSF therapy, the mean cumulative duration was 6.6 years, ranged from 0.4 to 19. Two patients showed no response to G-CSF therapy. Four patients among total 46 patients developed MDS/AML and 3 patients were alive after receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Total 12 out of 46 patients (26%) with SCN were underwent HSCT before malignant transformations due to recurrent infections and/or the long-term use of G-CSF. Reduced intensity conditionings (RIC) were used in part of patients. All patients were alive after HSCT. In Japan, high proportion of patients was treated with HSCT using RIC before malignant transformations. The accumulation of cases is necessary to establish suitable conditioning regimen and appropriate indication of HSCT in patients with SCN. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
