    "abstract_text": "Background: Flow cytometric studies are useful in the diagnostic workup of patients with unexplained cytopenias and it has been demonstrated that bone marrow aspirates with immunophenotypic abnormalities by flow cytometry but not diagnostic morphologic or cytogenetic findings frequently evolve into myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (Kern 2013). Two flow cytometric scoring systems (FCSSs), the Wells FCSS and the Ogata FCSS, have diagnostic and prognostic utility. The Wells FCSS utilizes a difference from normal algorithm incorporating more than ten phenotypic parameters. The accumulation of these abnormalities is not only useful in diagnosis but is predictive of patient outcome (Wells 2003, Scott 2008, Alhan 2014). The recommended Ogata FCSS has evolved to include four cardinal parameters: (1) CD45 intensity on the myeloid progenitors, (2) frequency of lymphoblasts, (3) frequency of myeloid progenitors, and (4) granularity of the maturing myeloid cells. The Wells FCSS is more comprehensive as it uses more phenotypic characteristics, while the Ogata score is considered straightforward to implement in a routine setting (Della Porta 2012, Ogata 2009). This study compares the Wells FCSS and Ogata FCSS for sensitivity and specificity to detect clonal abnormalities documented by SNP/CGH microarray and conventional cytogenetics. Patients and Methods: The cohort included 99 patients with unexplained cytopenias whose bone marrow aspirates were submitted for SNP/CGH microarray and flow cytometry (HematoLogics). The immunophenotypic data were independently assigned a Wells FCSS (Cutler 2012) and an Ogata FCSS (Della Porta 2012). SNP/CGH microarray was assessed for MDS-associated genetic abnormalities. The findings were further correlated with conventional cytogenetic findings. Results: Of the 99 bone marrow aspirates, 20 exhibited clonal abnormalities associated with MDS. The Wells FCSS identified immunophenotypic abnormalities suggestive of MDS for 18 of 20 CGH positive specimens (sensitivity of 90%) and did not detect phenotypic abnormalities suggestive of MDS in 68 of 79 CGH negative specimens (specificity of 86%). In contrast the Ogata FCSS identified immunophenotypic abnormalities suggestive of MDS for 13 of 20 CGH positive specimens (sensitivity of 65%) and did not detect phenotypic abnormalities suggestive of MDS in 64 of 79 the CGH negative specimens (specificity of 81%). In an attempt to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the Ogata score, the granularity parameter was modified from side scatter channel mode of the granulocytes (compared to the side scatter mode of the lymphocytes) to the side scatter channel at the 15 th percentile of granulocytes (compared to the mean of lymphocytes). This modified parameter detected all specimens defined as hypogranular by the side scatter mode, and detected an additional 11 specimens as hypogranular. All of these specimens were detected as hypogranular by the Wells definition. This modified granularity method was then used along with the other three cardinal parameters to create a modified Ogata FCSS. The granularity modification resulted in improved sensitivity (70% versus 65%); specificity was unchanged. While the modified method outperformed the original, it did not match the performance of the Wells FCSS. Conclusions: In patients with unexplained cytopenias, the Wells FCSS demonstrates superior specificity and sensitivity than the Ogata FCSS for detecting myeloid immunophenotypic clones associated with SNP/CGH array and cytogenetic abnormalities. Modifying the Ogata granularity parameter marginally improves the sensitivity but does not improve the specificity . Implementation of the Wells FCSS requires a comprehensive understanding of phenotypic intensities and relationships in non-clonal hematopoiesis for patients with cytopenias. While the relative ease of implementing the Ogata FCSS is attractive, improvements are essential for diagnostic accuracy; improving the granularity parameter alone is not sufficient. Adding measurements for the maturing myeloid and erythroid compartments may increase the diagnostic utility of the Ogata FCSS but requires further study.
