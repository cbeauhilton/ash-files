    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1554 T cells in the tumor microenvironment influence the biology of malignant cells in many hematologic malignancies, often through cytokine-mediated interactions. Recent studies involving healthy B cells and CD4 + T cells identified an interplay between IL-6 and IL-21, whereby IL-6 increased IL-21 production by T cells, driving the differentiation and IL-6 secretion of nearby B cells. In addition to their known effects on healthy B cell function, IL-6 and IL-21 have also been implicated in the pathology of various lymphomas. In Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), IL-6 is elevated in the bone marrow and is associated with increased IgM production. However, the function of IL-21 in the WM tumor microenvironment and its relationship to IL-6 is poorly understood. Our objective in this study was to characterize IL-21 production and function in WM and to examine the role of IL-6 and IL-21 in regulating interactions between malignant B cells and T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Immunohistochemistry revealed significant IL-21 staining in bone marrows of patients with WM (n=5), but the areas of infiltration by WM in the bone marrow sections appeared negative for IL-21 staining. To better understand the origin of IL-21 in in the tumor microenvironment, IL-21 expression was assessed by PCR in the CD19 \u2212 CD138 \u2212 fraction of cells remaining in patient bone marrow aspirates after positive selection for malignant B cells (n=5). IL-21 transcript was detected in 4/5 samples. CD19 \u2212 CD138 \u2212 cells activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies expressed higher levels of IL-21 transcript and secreted significantly higher levels of IL-21 protein compared to unstimulated cells, suggesting that IL-21 in the WM bone marrow is derived from activated T cells. Intracellular expression of IL-21 protein was confirmed in CD4 + and CD8 + cells within the CD19 \u2212 CD138 \u2212 population using flow cytometry. Furthermore, dual staining of WM bone marrow sections with antibodies against IL-21 and CD3 or CD20 revealed co-staining of IL-21 with CD3 + T cells but not with CD20 + B cells. The response of WM B cells to T-cell derived IL-21 was then assessed in positively selected CD19 + CD138 + WM B cells (n=5) and in the MWCL-1 cell line. Using flow cytometry, both the IL-21 receptor and the required common gamma chain subunit were detected on all patient samples as well as on MWCL-1 cells. Treatment of MWCL-1 cells with IL-21 (100 ng/mL) for 72 h increased proliferation by 35% (p<0.05) and IgM secretion by 80% (p<0.005). Similarly, in primary CD19 + CD138 + WM cells (n=5), proliferation increased on average by 38% and IgM secretion by 71%. No apoptotic effects were associated with IL-21 in WM. Characterization of STAT activation in response to IL-21 revealed significant phosphorylation of STAT3 in both CD19 + CD138 + WM cells and MWCL-1 cells and was associated with increases in BLIMP-1 and XBP-1 protein and decreases in PAX5. As STAT3 activation is known to regulate IL-6, we assessed the effect of IL-21 on B cell-mediated IL-6 secretion using ELISA. IL-21 significantly increased IL-6 secretion by both primary CD19 + CD138 + WM cells (n=4) and MWCL-1 cells (87.9 +/\u2212 10.9 ng/mL vs. 297.8 +/\u2212 129.2 ng/mL, p<0.05). Treatment with IL-6 and IL-21 together had no additional effect over IL-21 alone on proliferation or IgM secretion in MWCL-1 cells, but culturing anti-CD3/anti-CD28-activated CD19 \u2212 CD138 \u2212 cells from WM bone marrows with IL-6 significantly increased IL-21 secretion (n=3). Overall, these data indicate that T-cell derived IL-21 significantly promotes growth and immunoglobulin production by malignant WM B cells and that subsequent IL-6 secretion by malignant B cells may enhance the secretion of IL-21 by T cells within the bone marrow microenvironment.
