    "abstract_text": "The aim of the study was to evaluate factors predisposing to thrombosis in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia according to ALL IC BFM 2002. An analysis of 30 cases of thrombosis in 210 children (14%) treated due to ALL in the Department in years 2007-2011 was carried out. Age at onset, location, cause and treatment methods were taken into consideration. All analyzed patients underwent screening for congenital thrombophilia. The age of patients ranged from 1.5 to 16 years with the median of 7.5 years. Arterial thrombosis occurred in 1 person (3%), venous thrombosis in 29 (97%) patients. Thromboembolism was usually related to the central venous catheter (n = 27, 90%). Massive thrombosis occurred in 6 patients (20%). Relapses occurred in 2 children. The most common causes of thrombosis were: the presence of the central catheter (n = 27, 90%) and L-asparaginase treatment (n = 16, 53%). The factor V Leiden mutation was diagnosed in 1 patient, protein C deficiency in 1 patient as well, and elevated levels of factor VIII were detected in 3 cases. Five children (16%) underwent systemic thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and 17 patients (52%) had local thrombolysis. Anticoagulation with warfarin following low-molecular-weight heparin discontinuation was used in 6 patients (20%). The complete resolution of the thrombus was observed in the whole group of patients. Conclusions 1. A risk factor for thrombosis in children with ALL is the treatment of L-asparaginase and the presence of central venous catheter. 2. Screening for congenital thrombophilia in children treated for ALL should not be done routinely since the coexistence of this two conditions is rare. Thrombosis in children with ALL responds well to treatment. Disclosures: Klukowska: Octapharma AG: Investigator Other."
