    "abstract_text": "Clonal selection of cells harboring point mutations of the BCR-ABL kinase domain are considered a major cause of resistance to imatinib. More than 40 different point mutations have been described that cause a variable degree of imatinib resistance, and display a differential response to alternative kinase inhibitors, like dasatinib or nilotinib. Here, we describe three cases (2 m, 1 f) with imatinib resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) associated with a specific deletion of 81 bp of ABL exon 4. Patients were diagnosed with chronic phase (CP) CML at the age of 52, 54, and 68 years. After initial interferon alpha based therapies for 32, 60, and 71 mo, imatinib therapy was initiated at dosages between 400\u2013800 mg per day. After 18, 24, and 29 mo patients lost hematologic response in CP CML (n=2) or progressed to lymphoid blast crisis (BC, n=1). Molecular analysis of the ABL kinase domain revealed a deletion of a 81 bp fragment associated with a loss of amino acids 248\u2013274 in all cases. In one patient, an additional M351T mutation was found. In the two cases with CP CML, dasatinib was commenced for imatinib resistance, resulting in a partial hematologic and minor cytogenetic response (60 and 70% Ph+ metaphases, respectively) after 14 mo of therapy. The patient with lymphoid BC was treated with vincristine and prednisone and died 24 mo after appearance of imatinib resistance. In two cases, sequencing of genomic DNA revealed an underlying CTG/GTG mutation associated with a L248V amino acid switch. The point mutation activated a cryptic splice site within ABL exon 4 leading to an in-frame splice variant characterized by the loss of a 81 bp 3\u2032 portion of exon 4. We sought to evaluate the BCR-ABL kinase activity of the splice variant and the response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in vitro. The 81 bp deletion of p210 BCR-ABL was cloned using cDNA from one of the patients. Using this construct, retrovirally transduced Ba/F3 cells were transformed upon growth factor withdrawal. These cells expressed BCR-ABL at the transcript and protein levels. Presence of the 81 bp deletion was confirmed by sequencing. Despite the presence of the corresponding 27 amino acid P-loop deletion (\u0394248\u2013274), Western blot indicated strong autophosphorylation of BCR-ABL, which decreased in the presence of imatinib to non-detectable levels at concentrations of 1.25\u03bcM and above. In the presence of imatinib/nilotinib/dasatinib, the growth of BCR-ABL expressing Ba/F3 cells was shifted from an IC50 of 125/30/0.5nM for wild-type BCR-ABL to 470/185/1.9nM for \u0394248\u2013274 cells. Thus, in vitro data demonstrate that deletion of almost the entire P-loop does not abrogate BCR-ABL kinase activity and results in only marginal resistance towards ABL kinase inhibitors. We conclude that deletions of BCR-ABL may be the result of alternative splicing generated by point mutations associated with resistance to imatinib. The \u0394248\u2013274 splice variant retains BCR-ABL kinase activity and sensitivity to imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib."
