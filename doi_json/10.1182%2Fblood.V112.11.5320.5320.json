    "abstract_text": "The ETV6-PDGFR\u03b2 hybrid protein (EP\u03b2) is found in a subset of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) associated with eosinophilia. EP\u03b2 is the archetype of a larger group of hybrid receptors that are produced by chromosomal translocations of PDGFR genes and cause atypical myeloproliferative neoplasms. In EP\u03b2, the N-terminal portion of the ETV6 transcription factor replaces the PDGFR\u03b2 ligand-binding domain and induces the activation of the chimera through its pointed domain (PNT domain, also called helix-loop-helix or SAM domain). This domain mediates ligand-independent EP\u03b2 oligomerization, resulting in constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. In addition, we showed that EP\u03b2 and other hybrid receptor tyrosine kinases are much more stable than wild-type receptors and that the deletion of the PNT domain induced EP\u03b2 protein degradation, suggesting a link between the clustering and the stabilization of the EP\u03b2 protein. The PDGFR\u03b2 transmembrane domain (TM domain) is retained in EP\u03b2 and in most PDGFR\u03b2 hybrid proteins that have been described. We observed that the deletion of the TM domain (EP\u03b2-\u0394TM mutant) strongly impaired the ability of EP\u03b2 to sustain growth factor-independent proliferation of Ba/F3 and 32D cells. The phosphorylation of the mutant protein was also markedly reduced. We confirmed that EP\u03b2 is not inserted in membranes but resides in the cytosol, indicating that the PDGFR\u03b2 TM domain does not act as a transmembrane domain in EP\u03b2 but has a completely different function. The EP\u03b2-\u0394TM mutant retained the ability to self-associate in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, but showed a decreased level of polymerization when using cross-linking agents, suggesting that this domain is required for optimal clustering of EP\u03b2. In line with our findings on the PNT domain, the EP\u03b2-\u0394TM protein was less stable and, as a result, was expressed at a lower level. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the TM domain plays a role in EP\u03b2 activation by promoting the clustering of the protein and by preventing its degradation in cooperation with the PNT domain.",
