    "abstract_text": "Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent lymphoma with a median survival approaching 20 years. However, there is significant clinical heterogeneity with subsets of patients experiencing transformation, early recurrence or refractory disease. Some authors found that progression of disease within 24 months of diagnosis, in patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy (POD24), is associated with poor overall survival (OS). OBJECTIVE Evaluate the POD24 as an early clinical endpoint in FL and evaluate FL international prognostic index (FLIPI), and other baseline risk factors at diagnosis for overall survival and relapse. METHODS We conducted a retrospective and observational study in which 160 patients with follicular lymphoma who received R-CHOP at National Institute of Cancerology, Mexico from 2011 to 2017. We analyze with Kaplan Meier curves, log rank test and logistic regression model. RESULTS We analyze 160 patients, median of age was 53 years (26- 88), with a female : male ratio of 1.17:1. In this group: 86% had hemoglobin >12 mg/dL, LDH was normal in 62%, 1-4 nodal areas were affected in 64%, 56% of patients had high FLIPI score, 27% had B symptoms and we found bone marrow infiltration in 30% of cases; grade 2 Follicular lymphoma was the most common histological subtype (40.5%). Most of patients achieved complete response (81%), 12% partial response after the first line therapy. Only 13 patients (8%) presents relapse. Sixty four percent received maintenance. Only 13 of patients relapsed, 10 after 24 months and only 3 in first 24 months from diagnostic (POD 24). Fig. 1 Overall survival in our population was 89% to 8 years, the factors with statistical significance in the bivariate analysis were the more nodal regions affected (1-4), high FLIPI score and POD 24 POD 24, adjusted to FLIPI score, was an independent predictor of survival in regression analysis (p<0.041, HR:35 IC 95% 1.15-1060.21). The bone marrow infiltration at diagnosis was the only independent predictor for relapse (p<0.007, HR: 6.9, IC 95% 1.7- 28.2). CONCLUSION: In our study group, POD 24, was an important predictor of overall survival, and bone marrow infiltration at diagnosis was the only predictor factor for relapse.
