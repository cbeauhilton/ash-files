    "abstract_text": "The thrombocytopenia seen in patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) is thought to be due primarily to rapid platelet consumption, and is markedly improved by splenectomy. While a murine model of WAS shows only mild thrombocytopenia, we have previously demonstrated rapid platelet turnover in this model; that splenectomy improves the platelet count in WASP-(C57Bl/6J) mice; and that the latter mice do not achieve the same platelet count found in splenectomized WT mice. Here we show that CMFDA-labeled WASP- platelets are consumed rapidly and exponentially in WT recipients, with an estimated lifespan of 18 hours (vs. 87 hours for WT platelets). WASP- platelets are consumed only slightly more slowly in splenectomized WT recipients (lifespan 28 hours, vs. 102 hr for WT platelets). On the C3H background, WASP- mice have normal platelet counts but show a similar rapid, exponential platelet consumption rate (lifespan 25 hours in either C3H or C57Bl/6J recipients, vs 85 hours for WT platelets). In vivo platelet biotinylation studies demonstrate less effective labeling of WASP- (C57Bl/6J) platelets than of WT platelets. After a plateau phase, in vivo labeled WASP- platelets show the same kind of rapid platelet turnover seen with ex vivo labeling (figure 1). Our results imply a three-fold increase in platelet production rate in WASP- mice on either background, consistent with the markedly increased splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis seen in WASP- mice. WASP- mice also show an increased number of bone marrow megkaryocytes, the ploidy distribution of which is normal. We conclude that WASP- mice demonstrate a significantly increased rate of extra-splenic platelet consumption that is largely (on the C57Bl/6 background) or completely (on the C3H background) compensated by increased platelet production. The ability of WASP- mice to compensate for their rapid platelet consumption, and the normal ploidy of their megakaryocytes, suggests that platelet production is not impaired by WASP deficiency in this model.
