    "abstract_text": "The appropriate time to restart anticoagulation in the postpartum period is not known. Both the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology as well as American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) have issued guidelines regarding the use of anticoagulants during pregnancy but neither have generated recommendations regarding the timing of the first dose of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in the postpartum period. The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage was assessed in a retrospective cohort study of 95 women treated with enoxaparin and compared with 303 consecutive deliveries where anticoagulation was not administered. The rate of severe postpartum hemorrhage did not differ significantly for women treated with peripartum enoxaparin versus a control group of women undergoing vaginal delivery (3.6% versus 1.4%, P=0.72) or cesarean section (5.1% versus 3.4%, P=0.98). There were no severe postpartum hemorrhages following the re-initiation of enoxaparin postpartum. In 75% of vaginal deliveries and 49% of cesarean sections, enoxaparin was restarted within 24 hours. Two incisional hematomas were observed in the group of women who received enoxaparin within 24 hours following cesarean section. We conclude that severe postpartum hemorrhage is an infrequent complication following the administration of enoxaparin postpartum. In support of current clinical practice, enoxaparin can be safely administered 0 to 24 hours following vaginal delivery and 12 to 36 hours following cesarean section."
