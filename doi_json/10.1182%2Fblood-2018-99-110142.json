    "abstract_text": "Autologous CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapy has response rates of >70% in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and >40% in adult diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Large trials (ZUMA-1/JULIET/TRANSCEND) have highlighted that many patients fail to achieve durable responses. Several groups have reported on the phenomenon of CD19 immune escape as a cause (Grupp et al, NEJM 2013, Neelapu et al, NEJM 2017) and the NIH Pediatric Oncology Branch has shown CD22 as an alternative target (Fry et al, Nat Med. 2018). We developed a bi-specific CAR construct targeting CD19 & CD22 with intracellular signaling domains incorporating 4-1BB and CD3\u03b6 (CD19/CD22.BB.z) to overcome CD19 immune escape. Here, we present our Phase I experience with this bi-specific CAR in adults. This is a single institution phase I dose escalation study enrolling patients Age \u2265 18 years with relapsed/refractory B-ALL or DLBCL after standard therapies. Primary aim is to determine feasibility of manufacturing the bi-specific CAR and safety at three dose levels (1 x 10 6 CAR T cells/kg, 3 x 10 6 CAR T cells/kg, 1 x 10 7 CAR T cells/kg). Clinical response was evaluated as a secondary endpoint utilizing standard response criteria for ALL and DLBCL. All patients underwent lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide (500mg/m2 daily x3 doses) and fludarabine (30mg/m2 daily x 3 doses) followed by CAR infusion two days later. Patients were assessed at pre-defined time-points (Day 28, Month 3, 6, 9, 12 then every 6-12 months) with correlative assessments including immunophenotyping, single cell RNAseq, CAR qtPCR, serum and single cell cytokine analysis. Seven adult patients (5 DLBCL, 2 ALL), aged 35 - 75 years have been enrolled and 6 treated, all at dose Level 1 [Table 1]. The first 3 patients received freshly harvested cells and the remaining received cryopreserved cells (1 patient treated twice received initial fresh then cryopreserved product). None received systemic bridging therapy before CAR T infusion. Six patients developed reversible cytokine release syndrome (CRS,4 with Grade 1, 2 with Grade 2), onset between Day 1 to 13, and 2 patients received tocilizumab & systemic steroids. Three patients developed neurotoxicity (1 with grade 2, Day 8-11 and the others grade 1) with grade 2 neurotoxicity managed with steroids. Four patients required growth factor support beyond Day 28 and all treated patients show persistent B-cell aplasia. Two patients achieved CR: an ALL patient with disease in bone marrow/blood/CNS was MRD negative at day 28 & 60; a 75yo DLBCL patient achieved PR at day 28 and CR at month 3. Three others have ongoing PR and one died of progressive disease after initial PR at Day 28. A patient with PD at Day 28 subsequently treated with radiation and 2-months of revlimid/rituximab, now has no detectable disease 6 months post CAR-T. One patient with initial 6-month PR received a second infusion due to PD, did not develop CRS or CRES with 2nd infusion and has SD at Day 28 Notably, the patient experienced a lack of CAR-T expansion with the second infusion, raising the possibility of an immunogenic response to the CAR-T cell infusion. Flow analysis of all patients' peripheral blood showed CAR expansion peaked at median Day 13 (range Day 10-20) and CARs remained detectable [Figure 1]. Multi-parametric CyTOF phenotyping of the CAR19-22 products showed significant numbers of transduced CAR-T memory stem cells (phenotype: CD3+CD8+CD45RA+CD127+CD27+CCR7+). Single cell cytokine secretion analysis (Isoplexis,Rossi et al Blood 2018) revealed high polyfunctional strength index (PSI) in both CD4+ and CD8+ cell subsets in each patient's pre-infusion CAR product that reflected phenotypic expansion in patients. Additional correlative studies, including cytokine analysis, qtPCR based CAR quantification and CyTOF phenotypic analysis of the CAR-T cells will be presented. This first adult phase I trial of bi-specific CAR targeting CD19 & CD22 shows low toxicity with promising efficacy including achievement of CR in adult DLBCL and ALL patients. We have escalated dose to 3x 10 6 CAR T cells/kg and an expansion study of 60 patients will follow. CAR-T cells expanded within the first 20 days and continue to be detectable through 6 months.
