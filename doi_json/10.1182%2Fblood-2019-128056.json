    "abstract_text": "Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A gene ( KMT2A ) rearrangements are common genetic events in acute leukemia. They more frequent in infants and are found in 30-45% of acute myeloid leukemias (AML). They demonstrate great molecular heterogeneity with more than 90 partner genes and multiple KMT2A breakpoints involved (Meyer et al., 2018). These characteristics challenge both initial molecular diagnostics and MRD monitoring in ALs with KMT2A rearranged. As the accurate detection of all KMT2A -r types is crucial in order to correct patients' therapy and risk groups' definition, we aim to fully characterize KMT2A rearrangements within our cohort of patients using various techniques. Our recent study demonstrates a novel KMT2A partner gene - Bruton's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ), in a case of childhood AML. The patient is 9 m.o. girl who presented with WBC 69,3*10 9 /L and hepatosplenomegaly. Morphological, immunochemical and immunological examination revealed acute monocytic leukemia. Bone marrow aspirates were analyzed by G-banded karyotyping, FISH with KMT2A breakapart probe. The karyotype was 45,X,der(X?)t(X;11)(q22.1;q23.3),del(11)(q14),-20[7] with 95% KMT2A -rearranged nuclei. Real-time RT-PCR for 8 most common KMT2A rearrangements screening was negative. Targeted RNA-seq with FusionPlex Myeloid kit (ArcherDX, CO, USA) followed by high-throughput sequencing identified novel fusion transcript KMT2A-BTK with exon 9-exon 2 breakpoint junction. Sanger sequencing was used for validation. The achieved data on KMT2A translocation partner and breakpoint location was used for subsequent patient-specific MRD monitoring. The patient was treated according to AML-MRD-2018 local protocol and achieved complete MRD-negative remission after induction course. Then, a severe myelodepression developed after consolidation therapy, and the patient died due to infectious complications. BTK gene is located at Xq22.1 and encodes for Bruton's tyrosine kinase protein (Hashimoto et al., 1996), which is a cytoplasmic non-receptor tyrosine kinase essential for B-cell maturation and development (Shinners et al., 2007). BTK deficiency is strongly associated with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, where 80-90% of patients express either truncated or misfolded or mutated BTK protein (Valiaho, Smith, & Vihinen, 2006). BTK is also implemented in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, where it often has a deleted or a truncated kinase domain (Feldhahn et al., 2005). The opposite situation was reported for AML in several studies showing increased BTK activity (Gu et al., 2011; Tomasson et al., 2008). The presented t(X;11)(q22.1;q23.3) childhood AML is to our knowledge the first case of BTK translocations in hematologic malignancies, and its value for leukemogenesis is to be further investigated. However, as the breakpoint junction is located in BTK intron 1, upstream of its coding region (the translation starts in exon 2), we can speculate that BTK's structure itself is not committed and its activity is increased due to upregulated expression together with KMT2A . Therefore, the novel fusion KMT2A-BTK was for the first time revealed during the molecular profiling of KMT2A-rearranged AML in Russian Federation.
