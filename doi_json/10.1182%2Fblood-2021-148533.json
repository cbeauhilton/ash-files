    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Daratumumab (DARA) is approved across lines of therapy for multiple myeloma. In the primary analysis of the phase 2 GRIFFIN trial (NCT02874742) in pts with transplant-eligible NDMM (median follow-up, 13.5 mo), D-RVd improved the rate of stringent complete response (sCR) by the end of post-autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) consolidation versus RVd (42.4% vs 32.0%; odds ratio [OR], 1.57; 95% CI, 0.87-2.82; 1-sided P =0.068) (Voorhees PM, et al. Blood. 2020). With longer follow-up (median, 27.4 mo) after 12 months of maintenance therapy, sCR rates deepened for D-RVd versus RVd (63.6% vs 47.4%, 2-sided P =0.0253), as did the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD; 10 - 5 ) negativity (62.5% vs 27.2%, P <0.0001) (Kaufman JL, et al. Blood. 2020). Here, we present an analysis among clinically relevant subgroups (age \u226565 years, International Staging System [ISS] stage III disease, and high cytogenetic risk [del17p, t(4;14), or t(14;16) abnormalities]) after 24 months of maintenance therapy (median follow-up, 38.6 mo). Methods: Eligible pts with transplant-eligible NDMM were randomized 1:1 to D-RVd or RVd. Pts received 4 RVd or D-RVd induction cycles, high dose therapy, ASCT, 2 RVd or D-RVd consolidation cycles, and maintenance with lenalidomide (R) alone or with DARA (D-R) for 24 months. During induction and consolidation (21-day cycles), pts received R (25 mg PO on Days 1-14), bortezomib (1.3 mg/m 2 SC on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11), and dexamethasone (40 mg PO QW) \u00b1 DARA (16 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1-4 and Day 1 of Cycles 5-6). During maintenance (Cycles 7-32; 28-day cycles), pts received R (10 mg PO on Days 1-21; if tolerated, 15 mg in Cycles 10+) \u00b1 DARA (16 mg/kg IV Q8W, or Q4W per pt decision after Amendment 2) until disease progression or up to 24 months. The primary endpoint was sCR rate by the end of post-ASCT consolidation. Responses were assessed per International Myeloma Working Group criteria by a validated computer algorithm. Additional endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and MRD-negativity (10 -5 ) rate by next-generation sequencing. Results: In total, 207 pts were randomized (D-RVd, n=104; RVd, n=103); each group had a similar number of pts with age \u226565 years (n=28; n=28), ISS stage III disease (n=14; n=14), or high cytogenetic risk (n=16; n=14). Among response-evaluable pts, the rate of sCR after 24 months of maintenance therapy was numerically higher for D-RVd versus RVd among pts \u226565 years (63.0% vs 40.7%, OR, 2.47, 95% CI, 0.83-7.39), but similar for D-RVd and RVd pts with ISS stage III disease (57.1% vs 61.5%, OR, 0.83, 95% CI, 0.18-3.88) and high cytogenetic risk (43.8% vs 38.5%, OR, 1.24, 95% CI, 0.28-5.53; Figure ). MRD-negativity (10 -5 ) rates favored D-RVd versus RVd across all subgroups: \u226565 years (67.9% vs 17.9%), ISS stage III disease (71.4% vs 35.7%), and high cytogenetic risk (43.8% vs 28.6%; Figure ). With 38.6 months median follow-up, median PFS was not reached (NR) for pts \u226565 years in either treatment group (6 pts progressed: D-RVd, n=1; RVd, n=5). Among pts with ISS stage III disease, median PFS was NR for D-RVd and 33.1 months for RVd (7 pts progressed: D-RVd, n=1; RVd, n=6). Among pts with high cytogenetic risk, median PFS was NR for D-RVd and 36.1 months for RVd (10 pts progressed: D-RVd, n=5; RVd, n=5; Figure ). In pts \u226565 years, grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 88.9% of D-RVd pts and 77.8% of RVd pts; the most common (\u226520%) were neutropenia (37.0%; 29.6%) and lymphopenia (25.9%; 11.1%). Serious TEAEs occurred in 55.6% and 40.7% of pts, respectively. TEAEs led to study treatment discontinuation in 33.3% of D-RVd pts and 25.9% of RVd pts. One death due to a TEAE (unrelated to study treatment) occurred in a D-RVd pt \u226565 years of age. Conclusion: Subgroup analyses of pts in GRIFFIN show that the addition of DARA to RVd induction/consolidation and R maintenance, in conjunction with ASCT, may benefit clinically relevant subgroups. sCR rates were improved for D-RVd versus RVd in pts \u226565 years but not in pts with ISS stage III disease or high cytogenetic risk. Improved MRD-negativity rates were observed for D-RVd in all subgroups. Although immature and with limited pt numbers, PFS results also trended towards favoring D-RVd in these subgroups. Among pts \u226565 years, TEAEs and serious TEAEs were numerically higher for D-RVd. These results support the use of DARA in transplant-eligible NDMM pts among high-risk subgroups, although larger studies are needed.
