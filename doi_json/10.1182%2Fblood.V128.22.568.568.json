    "abstract_text": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an E3 ubiquitin ligase downstream of Toll-like receptors (TLR), is required for mediating signals in response to foreign pathogens and stress molecules, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS and AML. Although TLRs are expressed on normal HSC and TRAF6 is implicated in malignant HSC function, the normal physiological role of TRAF6 in HSC homeostasis and during hematopoiesis remains unknown. We find that TRAF6 is expressed in human and mouse HSPC (LT-HSC, ST-HSC, and MPP) at comparable or elevated levels relative to mature myeloid and lymphoid cells. To understand the role of TRAF6 in HSPC homeostasis, we generated hematopoietic-specific and inducible TRAF6 deleted mice by crossing Traf6-floxed with Vav-Cre (Traf6-HscKO) or Mx1-Cre (Traf6-iKO after PolyIC treatment) mice, respectively. Traf6-HscKO mice are born smaller and become moribund shortly after birth. Examination of peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) revealed a significant expansion of myeloid cells and reduction of lymphoid cells. Moreover, moribund mice developed splenomegaly and extramedullary hematopoiesis. To determine whether the observed phenotype could be driven by loss of TRAF6 in mature myeloid cells, we generated mice in which TRAF6 is only deleted in myeloid cells by crossing Traf6-floxed with LysM-Cre mice (Traf6-MyKO). Interestingly, Traf6-MyKO mice did not develop myeloid expansion in the PB, BM, or spleen, indicating that TRAF6 plays a role in normal HSPC function. To determine the cell-intrinsic role of TRAF6 in hematopoiesis, we transplanted BM cells from Traf6-HscKO mice into lethally-irradiated recipient mice. The recipient mice with Traf6-HscKO BM cells similarly displayed myeloid-biased hematopoiesis in PB, BM, and spleens. Strikingly, LT-HSCs from Traf6-HscKO mice were significantly reduced in the BM of recipient mice. To exclude a possible effect of myeloid cells on the reduction in LT-HSC, we examined BM HSPC from Traf6-MyKO mice. Consistent with a role of TRAF6 in normal HSC function, the LT-HSC proportions and numbers were not affected in Traf6-MyKO mice. We next examined the functional consequences of deleting TRAF6 in HSC by performing competitive BM transplantation assays. Although initial homing to the BM was comparable between WT and Traf6-HscKO cells, the donor-derived chimerism of Traf6-HscKO cells was significantly reduced for myeloid and lymphoid populations 1 month post transplantation, and declined to below 5% after 4 months as compared with control mice. In addition, donor-derived HSC, HPC, and total BM cell chimerism of Traf6-HscKO cells was dramatically reduced. To examine the effects of TRAF6 deletion on HSC function after BM engraftment has been achieved, competitive BMT were performed with BM cells from Traf6-iKO mice. Upon deletion of Traf6 (PolyIC treatment 2 months post transplantation), total PB and BM chimerism, and chimerism of Traf6-deleted LT-HSC and HPC dramatically declined. Collectively, these findings indicate that TRAF6 is essential for normal HSPC function and homeostasis. To understand the function of TRAF6 in HSPC, HSC-enriched Lin - Sca1 + Kit + (LSK) BM cells were isolated and examined for gene expression changes by RNA-sequencing. Genes directly implicated in cell cycle control were among the most differentially expressed in Traf6-deficient HSPC. Particularly, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) p21, p27 and p57 were significantly down-regulated in Traf6-deficient LSK cells as compared to normal LSK cells. CDKIs are negative regulators of cell cycle progression and involved in maintaining HSC quiescence. Consistent with the observed reduction in CDKI genes, LT-HSC and HPC (LSK) from Traf6-HscKO mice were less quiescent (lower proportion of G0 cells) and more actively cycling (higher proportion of G1/S/G2/M cells). Despite the established requirement of TRAF6 in myeloid and lymphoid cells during infection, our study uncovers a critical role of TRAF6 during normal HSC function and homeostasis. Our findings suggest that TRAF6 is a novel hematopoietic-requisite factor for maintaining HSC quiescence and controlling myeloid-biased differentiation. These findings reinforce the importance of innate immune pathway gene dosage and signaling requirements in normal and malignant HSPC. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
