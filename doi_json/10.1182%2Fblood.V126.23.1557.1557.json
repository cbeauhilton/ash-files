    "abstract_text": "Background: The clinical impact of ibrutinib is irrefutable and has been hailed as a revolutionary treatment for several cancers, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Despite high response rates noted with ibrutinib therapy in MCL (ORR, 68%), complete responses are low and durability of remission is suboptimal in MCL vs. CLL or Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) patients (Cheah et al Ann Oncol 2015). This relative lack of efficacy may be due to MCL cells having a higher proliferation rate and being less indolent in nature than CLL or WM cells. Tumor cells with a high proliferation index rely on optimally functioning protein metabolism/homeostasis systems. In MCL, this observation has been fortuitously exploited with the use of bortezomib, a 20S proteasome inhibitor. Indeed the ubiquitin proteasome system is a validated target and consists of several individual components whose function in MCL has yet to be mapped out. We have recently reported that inhibition of the 19S proteasomal deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), USP14 and UCHL5; with the small molecule inhibitor b-AP15 is lethal to drug-resistant WM tumor cells. This intriguing observation, prompted us to define the role of USP14/UCHL5 and their inhibition in a diverse panel of B-cell lymphoma cell lines, including MCL models as well as ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells. Materials: b-AP15 (and its clinical grade analog, VLX1570) was obtained from Vivolux AB and bortezomib from Sellekchem. Human NHL (DLBCL, MCL, Burkitt), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines as well as established drug-resistant subclones were used in drug-sensitivity screening experiments (total n=25). Results: USP14 and UCHL5 mRNA expression was queried in the CCLE database (Broad-Novartis) and showed highest expression in plasma cell and B-lymphoid tumor cell types. This was also observed at the protein level, wherein analysis of The Human Protein Atlas database revealed moderate to high intensity staining for USP14 and UCHL5 localizing to the cytoplasmic/membranous and nuclear compartments in high-grade NHL tissues. Next, we examined B-lymphoid tumor cell sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of USP14/UCHL5 with either b-AP15 or VLX1570 (72hr fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis assay or CellTiter Glo). We observed that MCL cells, including those resistant to ibrutinib (Jeko/IR cell line) were highly sensitive to VLX1570 (median IC50 12 - 25nM). In contrast, MM cells were not as sensitive (IC50's ranging between 58 - 90nM). Nine DLBCL cell lines exposed to equivalent time/concentrations of b-AP15 showed a median IC50 of 311nM (range, 70 - 910nM) and 3 HL models exhibited an IC50 of 531nM (range, 420 - 783nM). No difference in sensitivity to VLX1570 was noted between ABC-type vs. GCB-type DLBCL models. These functional results aligned with prior genomic inquiry where USP14 and UCHL5 gene expression was noted to be higher in MCL cell lines compared to DLBCL and non-hematologic cancer models analyzed (FDR=0.0019, p=0.001), suggesting their more central role in maintaining MCL tumor viability. Indeed MCL tumor survival (particularly ibrutinib-resistant cells) appears linked to USP14/UCHL5 function as treatment of Jeko/IR cells with VLX1570 (250nM, 12hrs) caused marked apoptosis (71.8% annexin-V+ staining) and cleavage of PARP-1. Moreover, the combination of ibrutinib and VLX1570 synergistically induced MCL cell death (median CI: 0.3). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that VLX1570 modulates several proteins critical for MCL survival including cyclin-D1, Myc and CXCR4/CD184. Reduction in cyclin-D1 was also noted to coincide with cell cycle arrest of VLX1570-treated MCL cells. Altogether, these findings suggest that VLX1570 modulates critical cellular signaling pathways utilized by MCL tumor cells, particularly those that are involved in resistance to ibrutinib. Conclusions: MCL remains a challenging malignancy to treat with no effective treatments for ibrutinib-relapsed disease. Our data supports the role of the proteasome-associated DUBs, USP14 and UCHL5, as critical factors involved in ibrutinib-resistant MCL tumor survival. VLX1570 is a potentially effective agent for the treatment of ibrutinib-resistant MCL. Disclosures Gullbo: Vivolux AB: Other: Shareholder. Linder: Vivolux AB: Other: Shareholder."
