    "abstract_text": "Cell cycle checkpoints guarantee that cells move through the events of the cell cycle in the appropriate manner. The mitotic spindle checkpoint, also known as the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), helps to ensure the proper segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells during mitosis. Our lab recently reported on the condition of the SAC in both mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We found that ESCs do not initiate apoptosis when the SAC is activated, which allowed these cells to tolerate a polyploid state resulting from the aberrant mitosis ( Mantel et al. Blood.  109 : 4518 \u20134527. 2007 ). These results lead us to conclude that the spindle checkpoint is uncoupled from apoptosis in ESCs. Knowing whether adult tissue specific stem/progenitor cells, such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), have checkpoints which are uncoupled from apoptosis is extremely important information. If HSCs were to manifest such checkpoint uncoupling as that which we defined for ESCs, this might present a problem for the ex-vivo expansion and transplantation of HSCs. Using multiparametric permeablized cell flow cytometric analysis, we found the mitotic spindle checkpoint to be functional in primary murine sca 1+/c-kit+/lin- cells (LSK cells), a population highly enriched in primitive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Using nocodazole, which exerts its affect by depolymerizing microtubules, we were able to activate the spindle checkpoint in low density mononuclear cells collected from murine bone marrow. Through flow cytometric analysis of the LSK cells in the mononuclear fraction, we were able to determine that spindle checkpoint activation in LSK cells resulted in a cell cycle arrest in mitosis, which was determined by DNA content of the cells, and eventually this arrest lead to cell death via apoptosis, as indicated by caspase-3 activation. This behavior is unlike that of ESCs, which exit mitosis and become polyploidy after prolonged spindle checkpoint activation. Thus the mitotic spindle checkpoint appears to be coupled to apoptosis in this particular set of tissue specific stem/progenitor cells, which lessens the possibility that ex-vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells will result in abnormalities to these cells that may give rise to disease initiation or progression after their transplantation.",
