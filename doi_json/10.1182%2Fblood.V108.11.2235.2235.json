    "abstract_text": "Apart from PML-RAR\u03b1 acute promyelocytic leukemia all other acute myeloid leukemias (AML) are unresponsive to retinoid differentiation therapy. However, in our study we show that elevating the levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) confers onto retinoid X receptor (RXR)-selective agonists (\u201crexinoids\u201d) the ability to induce terminal granulocyte differentiation and apoptosis of all-trans retinoic acid-resistant and insensitive AML cell lines and patients\u2019 AML blasts. Protein kinase A activation leads to co-repressor release from the RAR subunit of the RAR-RXR heterodimer, resulting in \u201cde-subordination\u201d of otherwise silent RXR, which acquires transcriptional competence in response to cognate ligands. Rexinoid-cAMP induction of endogenous RAR\u03b2 is blunted in mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking RARs, but re-introduction of exogenous RAR\u03b1 re-establishes responsiveness, thus confirming that the RAR\u03b1-RXR heterodimer is the rexinoid mediator. The apoptogenic effect of this treatment involves enhanced expression of the death receptor DR5 and its cognate ligand, the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), both of which are known to induce apoptosis in a tumor cell-selective manner and lead to the activation of initiator caspases. Immunohistochemistry confirmed induction of TRAIL and DR5 in AML patient blasts cultured \u201cex vivo\u201d. AML patients\u2019 blasts responded to rexinoid-cAMP combination treatment with induction of maturation and apoptosis, independent of karyotype, immunophenotype, and FAB classification. Clonogenic assays revealed complete inhibition of blast clonogenicity in four out of five tested samples. Indeed, it is known that cAMP levels can be elevated also by treating cells with 3\u2032, 5\u2032-cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEi\u2019s). These observation and the clinical availability of the corresponding drugs provide a rationale for initiating clinical studies addressing the efficacy of combinatorial PDEi-rexinoid therapy in AML patients. Together with our recent finding that a very promising class of epigenetic anti-tumor drugs operates through activation of TRAIL expression ( Nat Med  2005 , 11 (1): 7784 ), the possibility to target both the ligand (TRAIL) by HDAC inhibitors and the cognate receptors (DR4, DR5) by the above described rexinoid crosstalk may represent a promising therapeutic option which might lead, despite the genetic, morphologic, and clinical variability of AML, to a novel therapeutic option for AML patients by inducing a tumor-selective death pathway."
