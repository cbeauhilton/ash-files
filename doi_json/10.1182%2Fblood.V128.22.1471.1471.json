    "abstract_text": "Ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is an attractive therapeutic strategy for many hematologic diseases and genetic disorders. Therefore, a variety of ex vivo expansion techniques have been developed, however these systems were not well done to get long term HSCs (LT-HSCs) which have a long term hematopoietic reconstitution ability. As the reasons, it is considered that the factors associating with the proliferation and self-renewal of LT-HSCs have not been clear yet. To obtain the factors to stimulate the proliferation and self-renewal of LT-HSCs, various conditioned media were evaluated. The supernatants of COS-1 cells transfected with cDNA cording for RelA (one of nuclear factor kappa B subunits) stimulated the proliferation of human CD34+ cells derived from umbilical cord blood (UCB) and increased the number of CFU-Mix strongest of all evaluated conditioned media. 60 liters of the supernatants of COS-1 cells transfected RelA genes were separated by column chromatography purifications. LC-MS/MS analysis of the final active fraction provided the information of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) as a growth factor. HDGF is a 24kD heparin-binding protein and has reported to stimulate the proliferation in various types of cells including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and hepatoma cells, its receptor(s) and signaling remain unclear, moreover, has no known function in hematopoiesis. The recombinant human HDGF indicated the ability to enhance the proliferation of CD34+ cells dose-dependently and increased the number of CFU-Mix in combination with cytokines compared to cytokines alone, especially HDGF showed the strongest synergy effect in a combination with TPO in all combinations of cytokines. Next, uncultured (UC) CD34+ cells, the cells of an equal initial number of CD34+ cells after the serum-free condition cultures in the presence of TPO alone (T), HDGF alone (H) and HDGF+TPO (HT) were transplanted into sublethally irradiated NOG (NOD/Shi-scid,IL-2R\u03b3KO) mice. HT increased the number of CD34+CD38- cells compared to UC, T and H. Analysis of CD34+CD38- cells in bone marrow cells of NOG mice 24 weeks after transplantation revealed that the mean of absolute number of CD34+CD38- cells in HT group showed about 4-fold, that in H group showed about 3-fold compared to that in UC group, however, that in T group were not detected.These results indicated that HT increased HSCs including short term and long term HSCs. In order to investigate whether HDGF could increase the number of LT-HSCs, serial transplantation experiment was carried out. Uncultured CD34+ cells and the CD34+ cells cultured with HT were transplanted into sublethally irradiated NOG mice. At 24 weeks after transplantation, the mean of absolute number of CD34+CD38- cells in HT group showed 6-fold compared to that in UC group, a half of total number of bone marrow cells from each mouse in both groups were transplanted into one secondary sublethally irradiated NOG mouse. Analysis of human hematopoietic cells in both group 20 weeks after transplantation revealed that multi-lineage human hematopoietic cells, such as CD3+ cells, CD19+ cells, CD33+ cells, CD235a+ cells, erythrocytes and platelets, were detected in all mice in HT group, but were not detected in all mice in UC group. The mean of absolute number of CD34+CD38- cells in bone marrow of HT group showed 30-fold compared to that of UC group. These results indicated that HDGF could increase the number of LT-HSCs. We showed here that the CD34+ cells cultured with HDGF can be transplanted to secondary hosts to give rise to long-term multilineage repopulation. Thus, HDGF is a novel factor to promote the proliferation of HSCs and plays an important role in hematopoiesis. HDGF will contribute the new HSCs expansion system development by using UCB for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
