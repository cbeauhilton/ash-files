    "abstract_text": "Background: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic disorders, which can be difficult to diagnose based only on morphologic bone marrow examination. Karyotyping can be useful in diagnosing borderline cases. However, only 40% of patients with MDS have an abnormal karyotype. Flow cytometry(FCM) approaches have been described but not clearly defined in MDS due to use of different criteria. We devised a 10-parameter FCM panel, mainly including myeloid and erythroid maturation markers, to differentiate MDS marrows from normal marrows. Design: Bone marrow from 91 patients with cytopenia(s) or anemia were included in the study(10/2005\u20137/2006). Cases were divided into 3 groups: normal, not morphologically suspicious for MDS, 46 cases, equivocal, morphologically suggestive but not diagnostic of MDS, 20 cases, morphologically diagnostic of MDS, 25 cases. 10 FCM paremeters were performed and scored: hypogranularity, aberrant expression of CD56, lack of CD10 expression, decreased CD64 expression, & lack of CD13 or CD33 expression, & abnormal CD13/CD16 or CD16/CD11b pattern, increase of CD 34 expression gating on all cells excluding erythrocytes, decreased expression of CD71/Glycophorin gating on erythroid precursors. Karyotypings were analyzed. Results: and (see Table 1 and 2). Karyotyping were anlayzed in 86 cases. Cytogenetic abnormalities were found in 2.2% (1/44) of normal group, 5.3% (1/19) of equivocal group and 34.8% (8/43) of MDS group. In MDS group 7 of 8 patients (87.5%) who had both morphologic and cytogenetic diagnosis of MDS were scored >=3 of 8 FCM parameters. Conclusions: Study showed the 8-parameter FCM panel was more predictive of MDS than 10-parameters one. Both CD13/CD16 & CD16/CD11b patterns were considered to be non-specific. In 8-parameter panel, zero score tended to rule out MDS, while score >=3 suggested MDS. The most specific FCM parameters were hypogranularity, CD34, aberrant expression of CD56 or lack of CD10 expression by mature granulocytes. CD71/Glycophorin A might be useful in identifying dysplasia in erythroid lineage. Table 1. Comparison of FCM Parameters in Patients with/without MDS  Parameters/Group . Normal Group(A)(n=46) .
