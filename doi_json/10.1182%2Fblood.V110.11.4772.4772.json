    "abstract_text": "Background: Neurologic complications of multiple myeloma (MM) are numerous, however little is known about strokes occurring in the course of MM and its treatment. Methods: 2877 MM patients were seen for an initial evaluation at our institution over a 5-year period (1998\u20132002). Patients were identified using discharge summaries by combining ICD-9 codes for MM and stroke. They were included if they had clinical and radiological features of acute stroke. Ischemic stroke was defined as a new acute neurologic deficit lasting > 24 hours, irrespective of diffusion-weighted MRI results. Diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke was made in patients with new acute neurologic deficit plus evidence of hemorrhage on CT scan. We retrospectively reviewed medical records for demographics, type of MM and treatment, stroke type, clinical features, relevant imaging and laboratory data, and outcomes. Results: The 11 patients that we identified included eight with ischemic strokes and three with subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH). There were no patients with intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The overall incidence of stroke in this cohort was 76/100,000 per year, whereas the incidence of ischemic stroke was 56/100,000 per year. The mean age of patients with ischemic stroke was 59 years. Seven had one or more stroke risk factors and an equal number had received thalidomide. The latter were given small doses of coumadin as part of the treatment protocol; at the time of the stroke, INR range was 0.9\u20131.4. Based on clinical, radiological and other laboratory features, of the eight patients with ischemic strokes, two were presumed cardio-embolic (one had infective endocarditis), five were thrombotic, and one was caused by hypoperfusion. Two patients had findings of severe stenosis/occlusion in vessels corresponding to the infracted brain territory (internal carotid and basilar arteries). Two patients had documented normal plasma viscosity and three had evidence of extra-cranial thrombosis at the time of the stroke. In the three patients with SAH, hemorrhage occurred in the setting of trauma and thrombocytopenia, although one patient had an incidental anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Seven patients were left with minor or no deficits and four died, two in each of the groups. Conclusion: Overall, strokes did not appear to be more common in MM patients than in the general population, and the pathophysiology was likewise, not different than in patients without MM, with the exception of one patient with infective endocarditis, which is probably directly related to MM or its treatment. The highly selected referral population at our myeloma institute, and the retrospective nature of the study probably underestimate the incidence of stroke. The role of thalidomide in stroke remains unknown. Thrombocytopenia and trauma are probable risk factors for subarachnoid hemorrhage in MM patients. Fatal outcomes were frequent, but when death did not occur, the deficits were minor.",
