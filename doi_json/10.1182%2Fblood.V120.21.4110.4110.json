    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4110 Introduction: Rapamycin (RAPA) inhibits the serine/threonine kinase mammalian Target of Rapamycin to profoundly modulate immune cell function. Dendritic cells (DC) exposed to RAPA (RAPA-DC) exhibit tolerogenic properties, including promotion of experimental cardiac allograft survival. RAPA-DC enrich for CD4 + FoxP3 + regulatory T cells and induce alloreactive T cell apoptosis and anergy. Yet, paradoxically, RAPA-DC secrete increased IL-12, which is central for the generation of IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 + T helper type 1 cells. IFN-\u03b3 can be pro-apoptotic, and IL-12-driven IFN-\u03b3 inhibits graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We hypothesized that IL-12 hi RAPA-DC, unlike control (CTR)-DC, would be effective in the prevention of GVHD by supporting IFN-\u03b3-mediated apoptosis of alloreactive T cells. Methods: DC were generated from C57BL/6 (H2- b ) or B6.129S7- Ifngr1 tm1Agt /J (IFN-\u03b3-R \u2212/\u2212 [H2- b ]) bone marrow (BM) in 7 day (d) culture in the absence (CTR-DC) or presence of RAPA (RAPA-DC). CTR- and RAPA-DC cultures remained either untreated or were stimulated via TLR4 with LPS (100 ng/ml) for an additional 18 hours. Washed and CD11c + purified DC from these groups were then used as stimulators of allogeneic CD4 + T cells (BALB/c [H2- d ] or CByJ.129S7(B6)- Ifngr1 tm1Agt /J [IFN-\u03b3-R \u2212/\u2212 {H2- d }]) in 5 d mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) with or without anti-IFN-\u03b3 antibody. T cell apoptosis was quantified using an Annexin V Apoptosis Detection kit. The capacity of DC to prevent GVHD was assessed in irradiated BALB/c mice reconstituted with 5\u00d710 6 T cell-depleted B6 BM on d0. Recipient mice received 1\u00d710 6 CD11c + BALB/c DC (CTR-, RAPA-, or LPS-exposed DC) on d0 and 1\u00d710 6 B6 T cells on d1. Mice were monitored daily, and moribund mice or those with >20% weight loss were euthanized. Results: Compared to CTR-DC, especially when LPS-stimulated, RAPA-DC induced increased apoptosis (Annexin V + 7-AAD + ) of alloreactive CD4 + T cells in MLR (13.9\u00b11.6% versus 7.1\u00b10.2%; +LPS: 30.6\u00b13.4% versus 14.7\u00b13.6%; both p<0.05). Neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 in co-cultures containing LPS-stimulated RAPA-DC decreased levels of apoptosis to those of LPS-exposed CTR-DC (18.5\u00b11.3% versus 14.7\u00b13.6%; NS). IFN-\u03b3-R \u2212/\u2212 CD4 + T cells exposed to LPS-stimulated IL-12 hi RAPA-DC exhibited decreased apoptosis when compared to wild-type CD4 + T cells (WT 15.7\u00b13.6% versus IFN-\u03b3-R \u2212/\u2212 4.9\u00b11.1%; p<0.05) ( Figure 1 ). There was no difference in the extent of apoptosis of alloreactive CD4 + T cells induced by IFN-\u03b3-R \u2212/\u2212 RAPA-DC compared to WT RAPA-DC (10.6\u00b17.6% versus 12.4\u00b17.6% respectively; +LPS: 30.1\u00b116.3% versus 27.3\u00b112.0%; both p=NS) ( Figure 2 ). The addition of anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAb to LPS-stimulated IFN-\u03b3-R \u2212/\u2212 RAPA-DC significantly decreased levels of CD4 + T cell apoptosis comparable to LPS-stimulated WT CTR-DC (18.0\u00b110.3% versus 22.0\u00b16.3%, p<0.05). Depletion of IFN-\u03b3 did not impact on the T reg -enriching capacity (CD4 hi FoxP3 + /CD4 hi FoxP3 \u2212 ) of RAPA-DC (24.2\u00b10.4% versus 29.2\u00b16.2% with anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAb; p=NS). Further, whereas CTR-DC and LPS-exposed CTR-DC did not prolong survival, IL-12 hi RAPA-DC significantly prolonged survival from GVHD (median survival in days: GVHD, 17.5 d; RAPA-DC, 27 d, p=NS compared to GVHD; RAPA-DC + LPS, 35 d, p50 d, p<0.01) ( Figure 3 ). In contrast, CTR-DC had comparable GVHD mortality (21 d, p=NS). Conclusions: Increased apoptosis induced by LPS-stimulated IL-12 hi RAPA-DC is mediated directly on CD4 + allogeneic T cells via IFN-\u03b3 and not through actions on DC. Thus, increased IL-12 may support IFN-\u03b3-mediated activation-induced cell death while sparing regulatory T cells and may underlie the capacity of LPS-exposed RAPA-DC to prevent GVHD. IL-12 hi human RAPA-DC, generated with the aid of endotoxin-free, synthetic TLR4 agonists, may offer a means to harness the demonstrated capacity of both IL-12 and tolerogenic DC to prevent GVHD following hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
