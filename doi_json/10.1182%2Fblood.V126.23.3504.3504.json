    "abstract_text": "Background: Hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) storage disease (HERSD), which causes the accumulation of variant proteins that induce liver cirrhosis, was originally reported with a homozygous deficiency in A1AT (\u03b11-antitrypsine, G342K, Z-mutation). The molecular mechanisms responsible for the A1AT Z mutation causing hepatocyte injuries have been examined extensively, and have been associated with increased ER retention as a conformational disease, the activation of ER-specific stress responses, up-regulated mitochondrial autophagy, and mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. Fibrinogen storage disease (FSD) or HERSD associated with hypofibrinogenemia was initially reported in patients with the \u03b3G284R variant (Brennan SO: Am J Pathol 2000; 157: 189-96). Another three types of heterozygous \u03b3-chain variant fibrinogens in the C terminal region (\u03b3T314P, deletion of \u03b3G346-Q350, and \u03b3R375W) have also been identified, with several cases of \u03b3R375W being analyzed and designated as the Aguadilla mutation. We previously established \u03b3R375W variant fibrinogen-producing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and subsequently compared the synthesis of variant fibrinogens and morphological characteristics of these cells with those of wild-type fibrinogen-producing cells. The \u03b3R375W variant secreted less fibrinogen and producing cells indicated two types of aberrant cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, namely large-granular bodies and fibrous forms by immunofluorescence. We also demonstrated that these inclusion bodies were derived from ER using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and transmission electron microscopy (Kobayashi T: Thromb Res 2014; 133: 101-7). Objectives: The aim of the present study was to determine whether the generation of cell lines and subsequent immunostaining were applicable as a screening method for FSD. We establish cell lines reported as FSD other than \u03b3R375W and also reported as hypofibrinogenemia, but not FSD. Methods: The expression vectors coding variant \u03b3-chains were altered by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and stably transfected into CHO cells expressing normal human fibrinogen A\u03b1- and B\u03b2-chains (A\u03b1B\u03b2-CHO cells). The synthesis of fibrinogen (media and cell lysates) was measured by ELISA for each cloned cell line and morphological characteristics were observed under immunofluorescence microscopy. The expression vector coding \u03b3R375W was single transfected into CHO cells or co-transfected with a normal A\u03b1- or B\u03b2-chain expression vector. Results: The medium/cell lysate fibrinogen ratios of variant cells reported as FSD were markedly lower (\u03b3G284R: 0.05 \u00b1 0.01, \u03b3T314P: 0.08 \u00b1 0.04, and deletion of \u03b3G346-Q350: 0.08 \u00b1 0.05) than those of normal cells (0.77 \u00b1 0.22). In \u03b3T314P and deletion of \u03b3G346-Q350-fibrinogen-producing cells, immunofluorescence staining showed aberrant cytoplasmic inclusion bodies including the large-granular and fibrous forms observed in \u03b3R375W-producing cells. However, immunofluorescence staining for \u03b3G284R-fibrinogen-producing cells did not show aberrant cytoplasmic inclusion bodies including the large-granular and fibrous forms observed in \u03b3R375W-produing cells. The medium/cell lysate fibrinogen ratios of variant cells reported as hypofibrinogenemia and non-FSD were also markedly lower (\u03b3S313N: 0.07 \u00b1 0.01, \u03b3C326S: 0.01 \u00b1 0.00, \u03b3C326Y: 0.00 \u00b1 0.00, \u03b3C326A: 0.02 \u00b1 0.00, \u03b3M336I: 0.07 \u00b1 0.01, \u03b3A341D: 0.06 \u00b1 0.01, and \u03b3N345D: 0.05 \u00b1 0.00) than those of normal cells. Immunofluorescence staining showed normal cytoplasmic patterns for \u03b3C326Y-, \u03b3M336I-, and \u03b3A341D-CHO cells, but large-granular forms (less than 10%) for \u03b3S313N-, \u03b3C326S-, \u03b3C326A-, and \u03b3N345D-CHO cells. Although CHO cells transfected with the \u03b3R375W vector into A\u03b1B\u03b2-CHO cells showed many aberrant inclusion bodies including the fibrous form, CHO cells transfected with not only the singular \u03b3R375W vector, but also the combined \u03b3R375W and normal A\u03b1- or B\u03b2-chain expression vector did not have any aberrant cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that the establishment of variant fibrinogen-producing CHO cells and observation of inclusion bodies with the fibrous form by immunostaining may be applicable as a screening method for FSD. Furthermore, aberrant cytoplasmic inclusion bodies were formed by the assembly of the variant \u03b3-chain into normal A\u03b1- and B\u03b2-chains.
