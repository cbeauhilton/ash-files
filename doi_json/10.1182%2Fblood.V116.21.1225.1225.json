    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1225 The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, product of the t(9;22) Ph chromosome, activates multiple signaling pathways in leukemic cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Ph + B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Previous studies have shown that NF-\u03baB is activated in BCR-ABL-expressing cell lines and contributes to transformation of primary B-lymphoid cells by BCR-ABL (Reuther et al., Genes Dev. 1998;12:968), but the mechanism of activation has not been defined (Kirchner et al., Exp. Hematol. 2003;31:504), and importance of NF-kB to myeloid and lymphoid leukemogenesis by BCR-ABL is unknown. To interrogate the role of NF-\u03baB in BCR-ABL-mediated transformation, we utilized a super-repressor mutant form of I\u03baB\u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1SR), which has been used to block NF-\u03baB nuclear localization and transactivation by constitutively sequestering NF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm. Using retrovirus co-expressing BCR-ABL and I\u03baB\u03b1SR, we found that I\u03baB\u03b1SR blocked nuclear p65/RelA expression and inhibited the IL-3 independent growth of Ba/F3 cells and primary B-lymphoid cells transformed by BCR-ABL. The effect of NF-\u03baB inhibition was primarily on proliferation rather than on cell survival, as there was no increase in apoptosis in cells expressing I\u03baB\u03b1SR. When primary bone marrow cells were transduced and transplanted under conditions favoring induction of B-ALL or CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasm in recipient mice, co-expression of I\u03baB\u03b1SR significantly attenuated disease development and prolonged survival of diseased mice. Molecular analysis of these leukemias demonstrated that NF-\u03baB inhibition decreased the frequency of leukemia-initiating (\u201cstem\u201d) cells in the CML model, but not in the B-ALL model, and was associated with decreased expression of c-Myc, an NF-\u03baB target. To clarify the mechanism of activation of NF-\u03baB in BCR-ABL-expressing cells, we targeted two upstream kinases that negatively regulate I\u03baB\u03b1, IKK\u03b1/IKK1 or IKK\u03b2/IKK2. To accomplish this, we engineered retroviruses co-expressing BCR-ABL and kinase-inactive, dominant-negative mutants of IKK1 (IKK1KM) or IKK2 (IKK2KM). Co-expression of either IKK mutant inhibited both B-lymphoid transformation and leukemogenesis by BCR-ABL, as well as induction of CML-like MPN, with IKK1 inhibition more effective than IKK2. Together, these results demonstrate that NF-\u03baB is activated in part through the canonical IKK pathway in BCR-ABL-expressing leukemia cells, and that NF-\u03baB signaling plays distinct roles in the pathogenesis of myeloid and lymphoid leukemias induced by BCR-ABL. In CML, NF-\u03baB may play a role for in generation and/or maintenance of leukemic stem cells. These results validate IKKs as targets for therapy in Ph + leukemias, and motivate the evaluation of small molecule IKK inhibitors in these diseases.
