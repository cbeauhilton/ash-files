    "abstract_text": "Background Blinatumomab is a bi-specific monoclonal antibody designed to engage and tether cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) to CD19-expressing target B cells. An ongoing phase I multicenter study in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) has shown that blinatumomab induces morphological and molecular remissions, defined as minimal residual disease (MRD) levels <10 -4 , in 47% of patients [Gore L, et al. J Clin Oncol 31 , 2013 (suppl; abstr 10007)]. It is presently unknown whether and to what extent blinatumomab affects T-cell phenotype and function in pediatric patients with BCP-ALL. Patients and Methods Eight children diagnosed with relapsed/refractory BCP-ALL at the Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children\u2019s Hospital in Rome (median age at diagnosis 5.8 years, range 0.5-14.6) received blinatumomab as continuous intravenous infusion for 28 consecutive days, followed by a 2-week drug-free period. Four out of 8 patients were given repeated treatment courses. Peripheral blood samples were collected before treatment (day 0) and weekly thereafter, for 4 consecutive weeks. Bone marrow (BM) aspirates were available on days 0 and +29 of each drug course. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were labeled with appropriate combinations of fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies to quantitate na\u00efve/memory T cells, \u03b1\u03b2/\u03b3\u03b4-expressing T cells and other immune effectors with potential anti-leukemia activity, such as CD3 + CD56 + natural killer (NK) T cells and CD3 - CD56 + NK cells. T-cell production of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-17 was measured at the single-cell level, after short-term (4-hour) stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. The TCR-V\u03b2 Repertoire Kit\u00ae (Beckman Coulter, Milan, Italy) allowed the flow cytometry analysis of 24 different V\u03b2 specificities on T cells, thus covering approximately 70% of the normal human TCR-V\u03b2 repertoire. Results Peripheral blood lymphocytes reached their nadir on day +1 (median 300/\u00b5L of blood [inter-quartile range 40-380] compared with 1,080/\u00b5L of blood at baseline [inter-quartile range 360-2,310]; p=0.0037 by Mann-Whitney U test for paired data), expanded within 7 days up to 3.5-fold above baseline, and included both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. By contrast, the frequency of both CD3 + CD56 + NK T cells and CD3 - CD56 + NK cells remained unchanged compared to baseline. IFN-\u03b3 production by patient-derived CD4 + T cells exceeded that observed in CD4 + T cells from healthy controls by 2-fold, indicating robust T helper type 1 (Th1) polarization. The frequency of Th2/Th17 cells, defined as CD4 + IL-4 + and CD4 + IL-17 + cells, respectively, was not different after treatment compared to baseline. CD31 expression on recovering CD45RA + na\u00efve T cells, a surrogate phenotypic feature for recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), suggested that thymic output may contribute to T-cell expansion after blinatumomab administration. Non-significant changes in the relative proportion of TCR-\u03b1\u03b2 and TCR-\u03b3\u03b4-expressing CD3 + T cells were detected after treatment (median 79.5% TCR-\u03b1\u03b2 + T cells and 19.3% TCR-\u03b3\u03b4 + T cells among total CD3 + cells) compared with baseline (median 87.4% TCR-\u03b1\u03b2 + T cells and 12.2% TCR-\u03b3\u03b4 + T cells among total CD3 + cells). Importantly, both CD3 + CD8 bright T cells and NK cells expressed lytic granule proteins, such as perforin and granzyme-B, at levels that increased during treatment. The analysis of V\u03b2 TCR repertoire revealed a restricted usage of single V\u03b2 domains by BM-resident CD8 + T cells, but not by CD4 + T cells. Specifically, the sum of V\u03b2 within CD8 + T cells in the BM averaged 56.7\u00b16.2% after blinatumomab, compared with 78\u00b15.1% in healthy controls (p=0.04; Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired data). Conclusions Blinatumomab expands both CD31 + CD45RA + thymic-na\u00efve and memory T cells with heightened IFN-\u03b3 production and is highly effective at clearing MRD in children with BCP-ALL. Skewing of the V\u03b2 repertoire within BM-resident CD8 + T cells may be consistent with clonal expansions. Disclosures: Zugmaier: Amgen: Employment."
