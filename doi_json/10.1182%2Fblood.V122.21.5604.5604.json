    "abstract_text": "Introduction The efficacy and safety of the novel agents, lenalidomide and bortezomib, in previously untreated MM has been demonstrated in several randomized controlled trials (Online-OnlyTs). In this study, we examine the cost-effectiveness of lenalidomide-melphalan\u2013prednisone induction followed by lenalidomide maintenance (MPR-R), and bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP), respectively, versus melphalan-prednisone\u00a0(MP), in patients with previously untreated MM. Methods We developed a partitioned-survival model to estimate expected clinical outcomes and costs in newly diagnosed MM patients receiving MPR-R, VMP, or MP as first-line therapy. The model had 3\u00a0mutually exclusive health states: (1) \u201cprogression-free, alive\u201d; (2) \u201cpost-progression, alive\u201d; and (3)\u00a0\u201cdeath.\u201d\u00a0 Progression-free survival (PFS) for MP was estimated by aggregating data across five Online-OnlyTs (Palumbo 2012, San Miguel 2008, Facon 2007, Hulin 2009, Palumbo 2006). Estimates of PFS for MPR-R and VMP were based on an adjusted indirect treatment comparison with MP, using data from MM-015 for MPR-R (Palumbo 2012) and VISTA for VMP (San Miguel 2008). Since many MP patients in both MM-015 and VISTA \u201ccrossed over\u201d to lenalidomide and bortezomib following disease progression in these trials, we estimated post-progression survival (PPS) for MPR-R and VMP based on a review of novel agents in MM (Messori 2011), which reported mean PPS of 30.9 months. Costs of MPR-R and VMP were estimated based on actual use of study drug in Online-OnlyTs; costs of adverse events as well as other disease-related costs were estimated based on published data. Health-state utilities also were estimated using published data.\u00a0 All costs were expressed in 2012 US$.\u00a0 Cost-effectiveness of MPR-R and VMP versus MP was examined in terms of cost per life-year (LY) gained, cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, and cost per progression-free life-year gained.\u00a0 Future costs and benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Results Mean estimated PFS was 3.4 years for MPR-R, 2.6 years for VMP, and 1.7 years for MP; corresponding estimates for OS were 6.0 years, 5.2 years, and 4.3 years, respectively ( Table 1 ). Mean total expected lifetime costs (discounted) are reported in the Table. The incremental cost per life-year (LY) gained versus MP was $75,392 for MPR-R and $86,213 for VMP; corresponding estimates of the incremental cost per QALY gained were $91,794 and $106,211, respectively\u00a0( Figure 1 ).\u00a0 The incremental cost per progression-free LY (PFLY) gained versus MP was $70,666 for MPR-R and $80,565 for VMP.
