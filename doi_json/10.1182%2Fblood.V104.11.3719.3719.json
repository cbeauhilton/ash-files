    "abstract_text": "Background: Anemia in the elderly is a common, well recognized, complication of CKD and is receiving increased attention due to the adverse impact on heart failure and accompanying mortality. Presumably a result of a high proportion of accompanying co-morbidities, anemia in the elderly has frequently been reported as multifactorial or due to anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Objective: To evaluate the prevalence and clinical features of concurrent non-renal causes of anemia in two groups of elderly (65\u201379 years (y) and >/=80y) patients (pts) with CKD not on dialysis. Methods: A subset analysis was conducted on data from a large, prospective, cross-sectional survey of 237 outpatient clinics comparing elderly pts aged 65\u201379y and >/=80y with anemia due to CKD to same age non-anemic pts as well as younger (<65y) anemic pts. Anemia was defined as Hb </=12 g/dL in both men and women. Results: A total of 2411 (46%) pts 65\u201379y (mean age 73.0 \u00b1 4.2; 54% women; 20.0% black) and 969 (19%) >/=80y (mean age 84.9 \u00b1 3.7; 59% women; 12.5% black) were evaluated and compared to 1842 (35%) pts /=80y, 48.4%, and /=80y, 7.5% vs. /=80y, 10.9 \u00b1 0.94 and /=80y, hypertension was most commonly observed as the main cause. Serum creatinine was significantly lower in pts 65\u201379y and >/=80y compared to those /=80y, 12.6% vs <65y, 11.7%), B 12 (65\u201379y, 2.12% >/=80y, 3.41% vs /=80y, 0.21% vs 100 ng/dL & serum iron /=80y, 25.4% vs /=80y, 159.2 \u00b1 223.0 vs /=80y had a greater number of co-morbidities versus younger adults. Conclusions: The prevalence and severity of anemia in elderly CKD pts including octogenarians is similar to younger pts. ACD and nutrient deficiencies were comparable across all age groups suggesting that in elderly anemic CKD pts (aged 65\u201379y and >/=80y) multifactorial causes of anemia are not more prevalent than in younger CKD pts.
