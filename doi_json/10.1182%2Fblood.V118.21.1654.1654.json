    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1654 Background: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an incurable, aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in which there is a need for novel targeted therapies. Activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway and its role in the pathogenesis of MCL has been highlighted in a number of studies. Constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway inactivates GSK-3\u03b2, a downstream target of Akt, that can phosphorylate cyclin D1 resulting in its nuclear export. There is also evidence that cyclin D1 mRNA stability and translation is enhanced by this pathway. The class Ia PI3K p110 catalytic subunit isoforms \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b4 are primarily implicated in oncogenesis. While the PI3K p110\u03b4 isoform is known to be enriched in lymphocytes, a gain of PIK3CA (the gene encoding PI3K p110\u03b1) copy number has been shown to be a frequent alteration in MCL. The expression and relative importance of the individual Class Ia PI3K isoforms has not been documented in this disease. With the development of isoform selective inhibitors, this is an important issue that needs to be addressed. Aims: We studied the expression of class Ia PI3K isoforms in primary MCL with relation to morphological variants and disease status. We also compared the efficacy of PI3K inhibition in MCL cell lines and primary samples using two novel inhibitors, GDC-0941(predominantly p110\u03b1/\u03b4-selective) and CAL-101 (\u03b4-selective), both of which are in early phase clinical trials. Methods: Tissue microarrays were constructed from triplicate 1mm cores from 144 MCL biopsies and 16 tonsil controls. The levels of p110\u03b1, p110\u03b2 and p110\u03b4 isoforms were then determined by immunohistochemistry using isoform-specific antibodies. The in vitro effect of PI3K inhibitors on cell viability and apoptosis was studied in 4 MCL cell lines, (Jeko-1, Granta519, REC-1 and JVM-2), and 15 primary MCL samples. Expression of the class Ia PI3K isoforms and changes in downstream targets of PI3K were determined by western blotting. Results: P110\u03b4 was expressed at a consistently higher level in MCL samples and normal tonsil controls compared to the \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms, while p110\u03b2 expression was weak and significantly lower than p110\u03b1 expression. On comparing expression of isoforms at diagnosis and relapse, p110\u03b1 expression was significantly increased beyond 1 st relapse compared to diagnostic biopsies (p=0.04) and tonsil controls (p=0.02), an observation that was even more apparent in 6 paired samples [p=0.008, median IHC score 19.6 (5.0\u221253.2) at diagnosis vs. 91.5 (38.6 \u2212 129) beyond 1 st relapse]. No significant change was found in the expression of p110\u03b2 or p110\u03b4 between diagnostic and relapse samples. There was no significant difference in expression levels of the 3 isoforms between blastoid and non-blastoid morphological variants. Expression of both the p110\u03b1 and \u03b4 isoforms was detected by western blotting in 4 MCL cell lines, but only Jeko-1 cells were sensitive to inhibition with GDC-0941. CAL-101 produced little or no apoptosis in all 4 cell lines. In primary MCL samples, GDC-0941 was consistently more potent than CAL-101, with decrease in cell viability of 32 vs. 20% at 1\u03bcM (p=0.15), 51 vs. 25% at 5\u03bcM (p=0.02) and 67 vs. 35% at 10\u03bcM (p<0.0001) GDC-0941 and CAL-101 respectively. GDC-0941 was also able to partially overcome the stimulatory effect of sCD40L and IL4 on primary MCL samples. Western blotting showed a consistent reduction in the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3\u03b2 in sensitive MCL cells. Conclusion: Our studies demonstrate that although p110\u03b4 is the most consistently expressed isoform, the expression of the p110\u03b1 subunit increases significantly in multiply relapsed MCL. This observation, in combination with significantly greater in vitro sensitivity of MCL primary samples to GDC-0941, compared to the p110\u03b4-selective inhibitor CAL-101, provides strong evidence for further evaluation of GDC-0941 in this disease.
