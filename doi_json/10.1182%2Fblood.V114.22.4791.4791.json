    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4791 Background Response and factors affecting response in patients with aggressive Non Hodgkin's Gastro Intestinal (GI) tract lymphoma to upfront Rituximab based chemotherapy is not well characterized. Methods 41 consecutive pts diagnosed and treated with GI tract lymphoma in 2002 to 2009 were studied as a retrospective cohort for clinical presentation, prognostic characteristics and long term survival. Prognostic characteristics and survival was analyzed using logistic regression and Cox Proportional Hazards model. Multiple imputation methods were used for missing data. Results 41 pts, median age at presentation was 58 yr (28-80). 10 (24.4%) were African Americans, 22 (51.2%) were Hispanics and 10 (24.4%) were Caucasians. 35 (85.4%) had gastric lymphoma and 6 (14.6%) had intestinal lymphoma. 33 pts had aggressive NHL. 31 had Diffuse large B cell lymphoma, 2 Mantel cell lymphoma and 1 Burkitt's lymphoma. 6 (17.6%) presented with stage IE, 4 (11.8) stage II1, 6(17.6%) Stage II2, 7(20.6%) Stage IIE, and 10 (29.4%) Stage IV. 28(82.3%) pts were diagnosed by endoscope. 5 (14.7%) pts underwent surgery as they presented with obstruction or bleeding, none underwent curative resection. All pts received Rituximab based chemotherapy upfront. 29 received CHOPR, 2 CVPR and 2 Hyper CVAD R. Mean follow up was 23.7 months. 22 (64.8%) pts had a complete response, 6 (17.6%) partial response and 6 (17.6%) had progressive disease. 11 pts relapsed. The median disease free survival (DFS) was 13 months (1-105). Age was the sole significant prognostic factor that influenced DFS OR 1.047 CI 1.003-1.094). Age (OR 1.164 CI 1.045-1.296), stage (OR 1.743 CI 1.053-2.888) and performance status (OR 2.703 CI 1.030-7.097) were factors which significantly affect survival. Survival function was 100%, 55.6% and 58.3% for low, intermediate and high risk group of stage modified IPI for gastric lymphoma. 100%, 70% 58.3% for low intermediate and high risk group as per the revised IPI but survival functions are not significant. 12 (35.3%) of pts tolerated chemotherapy with no grade 3 or 4 adverse events. 13 (38%) had g 3or 4 hematological toxicity. 5 (15%) had surgery post chemotherapy. 2 (6%) has GI perforation and 3 (9%) developed GI bleeding post chemotherapy. Surgical complications occurred after the 1 st cycle of chemotherapy. Conclusion Aggressive Non Hodgkins GI lymphoma can be effectively treated with Rituximab based chemotherapy as upfront therapy with a response rate of 83%. Age, stage and performance status significantly effect survival. R IPI may need to be revised to predict survival in gastric lymphoma. 15% treated with chemotherapy upfront may need surgery for complications. Perforation rate was about 3% and most surgical complications occur after 1 st cycle of chemotherapy. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
