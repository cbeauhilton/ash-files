    "abstract_text": "Revlimid\u00ae (R) or lenalidomide is the leading clinical compound in a new group of drugs called IMiD\u00aes, which have immunomodulatory properties. In contrast with thalidomide (T) R has significantly less neurological toxicity. Several phase I and II trials with R showed promising results in relapsed/refractory MM. Our group demonstrated that Bi augments tumor mass reduction and improves responses in patients (pts) receiving low-dose T and/or D. We report the initial results of a phase II trial exploring the combination of Bi plus R plus D (BiRD) in newly diagnosed MM. Methods: The trial is designed to accrue 35 pts. Thus far 28 pts have been accrued between Nov. 2004 and Aug. 2005 of which 22 pts (13 male and 9 female) are eligible for evaluation. R is given orally (po) at a dose of 25 mg daily on days 1\u201321 of a 28-day cycle. D is given po at a dose of 40 mg once weekly. Bi is given po at 500 mg twice daily. All pts also receive low dose aspirin (ASA)(81mg) once daily as thrombosis prophylaxis, prophylactic sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and a proton pump inhibitor. Responses are defined according to the EBMTR. In addition, the category of near-CR (nCR) is defined as a CR with a positive immunofixation. A minimum of 2 cycles is required for response assessment; all pts are assessed on an intent-to-treat basis. Results: Pt characteristics are as follows: median age of 62 years (range 36\u201377), hemoglobin of 11.4g/dL (range 7.2\u201315.1), platelets of 247k/uL (range 51\u2013526), \u03b22m of 4.0mg/L (range 0.8\u20135.1), CRP of 1.0mg/dL (range 0.3\u20138.4), creatinine of 1.3mg/dL (range 0.5\u20133.1), albumin of 3.6g/dL (range 2.3\u20134.9), and calcium of 8.9mg/dL (range 6.9\u201311.2). Conventional cytogenetics was normal in all pts; FISH abnormalities are as follows: trisomy 11 (2 pts), tetrasomy 11 (1 pt), del13q14(5 pts), t(4,14)(1pt), t(11,14)(2 pts). 52% of the pts are stage IIIa, 13% are stage IIIb, 35% are stage IIa. Responses are summarized in the table below. Of the 22 evaluable pts, 21(95%) have achieved an objective response (>PR) within 1\u20132 months of Rx with the remaining pt continues to respond. Nearly one third of pts have achieved either a CR(6/22) or a nCR(1/22-continuing on Rx). The remaining 14 pts(63%) achieved a PR. Of those pts who achieved a PR, 6/14 pts(43%) had >90% reduction in the initial paraprotein, while 12/14 pts(86%) had >75% decrement. 5 pts are now off study (3 pts in CR going to PBSCT and 2 due to toxicities). So far 15 pts have experienced grade \u22653 adverse events. These include, anemia(4.5%), neutropenia(4.5%), thrombocytopenia(4.5%), increased liver enzymes(4.5%), anxiety(4.5%), insomnia(9%), tremors(4.5%), hyperglycemia(4.5%), syncope(4.5%), Stevens Johnson\u2019s(4.5%) and colonic perforation(4.5%). DVT occurred in 3(13.6%) patients, all off ASA, of which 2 (9%) had an associated PE, one of whom died. No grade 4 toxicities have been otherwise observed. Three pts have undergone successful stem cell harvest of which one has undergone transplantation with melphalan 200. Engraftment was successful by day 12. Conclusions: BiRD is highly effective and safe in the initial Rx of MM. Stem cell harvest is not impaired after BiRD induction.
