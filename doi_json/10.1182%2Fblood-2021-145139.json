    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Aplastic anemia (AA) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by pancytopenia and a hypocellular bone marrow. Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a similar disorder with primary reduction in the red blood cell population and virtual absence of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow. While the etiology of immune mediated marrow failure is multifactorial, preceding viral infections have been associated with the disease; these include parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus. We present four cases of immune mediated marrow failure with either preceding or simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: The medical records of patients treated for AA or PRCA at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Parkland Hospital, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were reviewed for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Four patients without prior hematological diseases were identified who had SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to or with simultaneous the diagnosis of AA or PRCA. Results: Patient #1 was a 22-year-old white female who was diagnosed with asymptomatic COVID-19 10 days prior to her pancytopenia and AA diagnosis was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy (5% cellularity; Table 1). Her extensive work-up including HIV, hepatitis panel, immunoglobulins, B12 and folate was negative, and she underwent HLA-matched family donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Patient #2 was a 69-year-old Asian female who presented to her primary care physician with symptoms of fatigue and was found to be pancytopenic. CBC from a few months prior was completely normal. Further work-up was positive for COVID-19 and negative for HIV, nutritional deficiency, or hemolysis. She did not have respiratory symptoms, was eventually diagnosed with pRBC and platelet transfusion-dependent severe AA (5-10% cellularity on bone marrow), and underwent treatment with cyclosporine, equine antithymocyte globulin, and eltrombopag. She has had a partial response to this therapy. Both patients had bone marrow specimens stained for SARS-CoV-2 by immunohistochemistry that were negative. Patient #3 was a 76-year-old white male who was diagnosed with COVID-19 4 months prior to presenting with a non-ST segment myocardial infarction and found to be profoundly anemic, requiring pRBC transfusion. He re-presented with chest pain one week later and was found to be anemic again, and required transfusion. A trial of darbepoetin alfa was unsuccessful. Extensive work-up for malignancy, infection, and autoimmune etiologies were negative. He was diagnosed with PRCA based on the bone marrow biopsy and initiated treatment with cyclosporine. Patient # 4 was diagnosed with severe AA (presenting as pancytopenia) and COVID-19 infection. He had fatigue for one month and fever, chills and sore throat one-week prior seeking medical care. Testing for hepatitis, HIV, EBV, and CMV was negative. He was treated on a clinical trial (NCT04304820) at NIH with cyclosporine and eltrombopag until SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative then received equine anti-thymocyte globulin. He has achieved a complete hematologic response at 6 months and remains well at last follow-up. Conclusion: The four patients described had minimal respiratory COVID-19 symptoms, but they presented with cytopenia and were eventually diagnosed with bone marrow failure. It is possible that this is co-incidental due to the high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. However, there is emerging evidence that COVID-19 pneumonia is a hyperinflammatory and immune dysregulated state improved by dexamethasone therapy. Other immune mediated hematologic conditions, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia, have been reported. The onset from infection to cytopenia appears rapid, although patients often presented with symptoms for many days prior to diagnosis and thus testing may have been delayed from the onset of infection. This case series does not provide a mechanistic link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and bone marrow failure, but it raises the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may mediate an immunologic response that contributes to marrow failure. Patients appear to respond well to standard immunosuppressive treatment. Further cases and studies are needed to determine if this is directly linked to SARS-CoV-2 and whether the natural history and response to standard therapy is different than idiopathic cases.
