Furthermore, the effects of various drug therapies on QOL are little known but essential for cost-effectiveness studies. We have been conducting prospective assessments of QOL in all consenting patients registered in our MDS clinic using the instruments EORTC QLQ-C30, FACT-An/Fatigue, EQ5D and a global fatigue scale. We present cross-sectional results in the first 93 patients evaluated prospectively over 14.7 months. Methods: We analyzed QOL according to age, hemoglobin, IPSS risk group, transfusion dependence (Y/N), drug therapy and ferritin. Changes in QOL in the 64 (67%) patients with repeat assessments at a median time of 3 months were also examined. We examined the correlation between QOL scores using Spearman's correlation coefficient. We compared raw scores for clinically significant differences between MDS patients and normative data. Clinically significant (CS) score differences were considered 10 points for the EORTC, 7 for the FACT-An, and 4 for the FACT-Fatigue. Statistical significance (SS) using p 1000 vs. =< 1000 ug/L) on QOL scores without adjustment for confounders. Results: The median age was 71 y, with 59% males. Of the 89 patients with measurable IPSS scores, 84% fell into low/low intermediate risk categories and 7% had del 5q abnormality. 40% were transfusion dependent, 20% were receiving lenalidomide, 21% iron chelation and 21% growth factors. 50% had a Hgb of 100 g/L and demonstrated increased global health status QOL (p=.03). Finally, the visual analogue scores (derived) from the single-item global fatigue and the EQ-5D health state scales correlated very strongly with virtually every symptom and functional domain of the QLQ-C30 as did the FACT-An and EQ-5D . The UK converted EQ-5D summary state utilities /self-reported scores and EORTC QLQ-C30 global health scores are in the table below.  Health State EQ-5D . All patients . Hgb \u2265100 .

Simple numerical rating scales for global health and fatigue may be convenient screening tools to employ in the clinic for QOL assessment. Utility scores derived from longitudinal QOL data in MDS patients treated with different agents are both feasible and essential to calculate QALYs in this era of cost constraints and pharmaco-economic modeling.
