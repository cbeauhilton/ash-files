    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1846 Background The low frequency of TP53 (p53) alterations (<10%) in MM makes this tumor an ideal candidate for p53-activation therapies. Unfortunately, DNA alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and melphalan), when used alone, cannot fully exploit p53 mediated apoptosis. It is currently unknown the extent to which DNA alkylating agents and p53 activating small molecules are activating functional p53 signaling to induce apoptosis in primary MM cells, because, p53 mainly induces cell cycle arrest/DNA repair or apoptosis in the DNA damage response. Emerging studies demonstrate that PARP activation and p53 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation can negatively influence apoptosis induction but the exact molecular mechanisms are unknown. Methods For apoptosis and gene expression analysis 05 \u00d7 10 6 cells were incubated with 2.5 \u03bcM of melphalan, 10 \u03bcM of olaparib and 2.5 \u03bcM of nutlin-3a alone and/or combinations of melphalan with olparib and/or nutlin3a with olaprib for 24 to 72 hours before they were examined for cell death by the annexin-PI and FACS analysis. Gene and protein expression were measured by RT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. For combination studies, cells were incubated with 0.194\u201350 \u03bcM of melphalan and 0.625\u201340 \u03bcM of either olaparib or ABT-888 for 72 hours. p53 knock-down performed by lentiviral mediated shRNA. Vk*MYC mice with significant gammopathy (>20g/l on SPEP) used for in-vivo drug combination studies. Results Preliminary results support our principle hypothesis that, a PARP inhibitor (olaparib) enhanced Melphalan sensitivity in wild type p53 MM cell lines H929 and MM1S but not in p53 mutated or homozygously deleted cell lines U266 and KMS11, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that p53 knock-down decreased the synergistic effect of combining a PARP inhibitor with melphalan and Nutlin-3a. Again, combining a PARP inhibitor with the DNA alkylating agent melphalan induced clear PARP cleavage, a signature of apoptosis in wild type p53 MM cell lines H929 and MM1S. No significant PARP cleavage was observed after melphalan or olaparib treatment alone in H929 and MMIS. As expected, the p53 mutant cell line U266 did not show any PARP cleavage and p21 up-regulation after both drug treatments. Here we propose that the hyper-activated p53 from PARP inhibition along with DNA alkylating agents (melphalan) and/or p53 activating agents (nutlin-3a) result in better responses. Finally, in a murine xenograft model of human MM, olaparib potentiated melphalan activity in vivo , with significant reduction in M spike level. Conclusion Our studies indicate that DNA alkylating agents activate wild type p53, but leads to DNA repair and cell survival and this can be abolished by PARP inhibition in wild type p53 expressing MM cases. Moreover, our study also found that olaparib, and ABT-888 - PARP1 inhibitors currently in clinical trials - display different dose responses in MM cell lines and in the abilities of individual PARP inhibitors to sensitize MM cell lines to melphalan varied to a great extent in a cell context- and cell line specific manner.
