    "abstract_text": "Introduction Acute erythroid leukemias (AELs) are infrequent acute leukemias characterized by a predominant erythroid population, dysplasticity and ring sideroblasts. The 2016 revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification re-classified previous AELs as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) not otherwise specified (non erythroid subtype, or pure erythroid type), according to blast percentage in all nucleated bone marrow cells. Recent studies have offered the evidence that genetic profiles are associated with pathophysiology and clinical outcomes in myeloid malignancies. However, characteristic mutation profiles of AEL and its genetic differences or similarities with other-types of AML and MDS have not been fully elucidated due to the lack of a sufficient number of samples, although frequent TP53 mutations have been reported (35-43.5%). Method We performed a comprehensive genetic study, in which paired tumor/normal DNA from 24 AEL cases were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing (WES). Subsequently, in total 41 cases were screened for mutations in 69 driver genes associated with myeloid malignancies using targeted-capture sequencing. Genome-wide copy number analysis was also performed based on allele frequency of heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms and sequencing depth. Frequencies of driver mutations in AEL were compared to those in other-types of AML analyzed by the Cancer Genome Atlas Network (TCGA) (N = 197). Results The mean number of nonsynonymous mutations identified by WES was 10 per sample (range, 0-21), which was similar to that in other-types of AML or MDS. Most frequently mutated genes were STAG2 , TP53 , RUNX1 and TET2 (17%, respectively), followed by WT1 and BCOR (13%, respectively). All TP53 mutated cases harbored complex karyotypes. Subsequent targeted sequencing identified 3.4 mutations per sample on average (range, 0-9). TP53 was mutated in 8 cases (20%), and lower frequency of TP53 mutations in our cohort was attributed to the relatively lower proportion (21%) of cases with complex karyotype compared to those in the previous reports. Commonly mutated genes in other-types of AML, such as NPM1 , FLT3 , and DNMT3A , were relatively infrequent in AEL and affected 7 (17%), 4 (9.8%) and 3 (7.3%) cases, respectively. Genes associated with splicing machinery were mutated in 5 cases (12%), including SRSF2 (9.8%) and U2AF1 (2.4%). Of note, mutations in genes implicated in cohesin complex were observed in as many as 32% of cases, including those in STAG2 (24%), SMC1A (4.9%) and RAD21 (2.4%). Mutations in epigenetic regulators were also frequently identified in AEL, including those in WT1 (20%), TET2 (15%) and IDH1/2 (7%). Mutations in TP53 were mutually exclusive with those in cohesin complex (p = 0.04) and epigenetic regulators (p = 0.05). When we compared the frequencies of recurrent mutations in AEL to those in other-types of AML analyzed by TCGA, mutations in STAG2 (p = 6*10 5 ), SRSF2 (p = 7*10 4 ), WT1 (p = 0.01), GATA2 (p = 0.008), and BCOR (p = 0.02) were significantly more frequent in AEL, whereas those in FLT3 (p = 0.01) and DNMT3A (p = 0.007) were significantly less frequent in AEL. Mutations in cohesin complex and splicing factors were frequently observed both in AEL and MDS, and higher frequency of these genetic lesion in AEL rather than other-types of AML suggested that AEL and MDS are similar disease entities. Recently, genomic subgroups of AML with mutations in cohesin complex, spliceosome and TP53 have been associated with poor prognosis in AML, and poor prognosis of AEL was thought to be due to higher frequency of these genetic lesions. Conclusion WES and follow-up targeted sequencing revealed the genetic landscape of AEL. Frequent mutations in TP53 , splicing factors and cohesin complex were characteristic to AEL, and thought to be involved in its pathophysiology. Our data showed the genetic similarities between AEL and MDS, which were compatible with the partial integration of AEL into MDS in the recent revision of WHO classifications.
