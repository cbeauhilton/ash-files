    "abstract_text": "All- trans -retinoic acid (ATRA) plays important regulatory roles in hematopoiesis and is successfully used in differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Although ATRA effectively inhibits growth and stimulates myelomonocytic differentiation of myeloid progenitors, it is equally potent in causing expansion of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells. Results of studies utilizing mice that lack expression of a specific RAR and/or RAR subtype specific retinoids, as well as work addressing the molecular pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), indicate that the effects of ATRA on hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors are differentially mediated via the RAR\u03b3 and RAR\u03b1, respectively. Using qPCR we have now shown that RAR\u03b3 is expressed in human cord blood derived stem cells but not in more mature myeloid progenitors or myelomonocytic cells. This change in the RAR\u03b3 expression levels is paralleled by a reciprocal change in expression of RAR\u03b3 specific miRNA, which we have identified and validated using multiple experimental strategies, including RAR\u03b3 3\u2032UTR based reporter assays. RAR\u03b3 is also expressed in blasts derived from non-APL AML patients (over 80% of cases examined) and AML cell lines, but is not expressed in ATRA responsive APL cell lines. The expression of RAR\u03b3 miRNA, on the other hand, is markedly decreased in AML blasts when compared to the levels detected in cord blood derived CD34 + myeloid progenitor cells. Taken together our results suggest that finely tuned and miRNA mediated down-regulation of RAR\u03b3 expression in the myelomonocytic lineage provides a switch from pro-proliferation to RAR\u03b1 mediated pro-differentiation effects of ATRA. We predict that use of a RAR\u03b1 specific agonist, possibly in conjunction with a strategy that negatively targets RAR\u03b3 (as with RAR\u03b3 selective antagonist or siRNA), would be most effective in retinoid based differentiation therapy of non APL-AML.",
