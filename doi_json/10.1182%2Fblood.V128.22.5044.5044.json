    "abstract_text": "Introduction The identification of compounds which increase the number but also keep or enhance the activity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) could improve the clinical outcome after autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). So far, most attempts to increase HSPC numbers ex vivo have been unsuccessful because of either inadequate cell numbers and/or loss of engraftment capacity and HSPC quality during expansion. Executing drug discovery screens in vertebrate systems is generally expensive, technically challenging and time consuming. Therefore, the zebrafish represents a versatile vertebrate model allowing HSPC regulation and development studies during embryogenesis and adulthood. Methods We used a semi-automated chemical screen to identify modulators of HSPC activity by transgenic ( cmyb:EGFP ) zebrafish embryos. Verification of identified histone deacetylase ( HDAC) inhibitor candidates was carried out in vitro using human CD34 + HSPCs which were isolated from apharesis samples of healthy donors after mobilization with G-CSF by anti-CD34 coupled magnetic beads. The influence of HDAC inhibitors on HSPC phenotype, gene expression pattern as well as adhesion and migration capacity was analyzed after 5 days of treatment either in single or in co-culture with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Results The HDAC inhibitors valproic acid (VPA), resminostat and entinostat were shown to significantly amplify the number of hematopoietic precursors in a chemical in vivo zebrafish embryo screen (Arulmozhivarman et al. 2016). Treatment of human CD34 + HSPCs with these compounds in vitro resulted in a significantly increased percentage of CD34 + CD90 + cells up to 60% compared to controls which showed only 2% of double positive cells as well as in 3-fold higher CD34 + and about 12-fold higher CD34 + CD90 + absolute cell numbers. CD34 is a well-known surface marker for human immature HSPCs and in combination with CD90 it defines a potentially pluripotent subpopulation. In a co-culture setting, we found that VPA treated cells showed 2 to 3-fold higher attachment capacity on MSCs compared to the control cells. This finding led us to quantify the adhesive capacity of cells using static adhesion assay and atomic force microscopy based single-cell force spectroscopy (AFM-SCFS). Interestingly, detachment forces of VPA treated HSPCs were 3 times increased on MSCs compared to control cells and a similar phenotype was observed by static adhesion assay. Accordingly, the chemokine-mediated migration of VPA treated HSPCs towards SDF-1/CXCL12 was inhibited. To reveal underlying downstream molecules and mechanisms mediating the modified cellular characteristics, a whole genome expression array was carried out for HSPCs treated with VPA in comparison to untreated controls. Amongst a panel of regulated genes, the melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM/CD146), Notch 3 and its downstream effector Hes-1 as well as the SDF-1 receptor CXCR-4 were found to be significantly changed. Whereas the decreased expression of CXCR4 correlates with the inhibited migration potential of VPA-treated HSPCs and Notch-3/Hes-1 have a known role in normal and malignant hematopoiesis (Gu et al. 2016), the induced expression of MCAM on HSPCs was not described so far. The result was confirmed by flow cytometry which revealed a 40% MCAM-positive cell population when treated with VPA, whereas the control showed only negative cells. Additionally, significant higher transcript levels were detected for MCAM by quantitative real-time PCR in VPA expanded cells. Recently, we described a role of MCAM in MSCs for the hematopoietic support (Stopp et al. 2013). The inducible expression in HSPCs may reflect homotypic interactions which preserve a more immature subpopulation with high stem cell activity. Conclusion We describe for the first time the ability of the HDAC inhibitors VPA, resminostat and entinostat to efficiently expand CD34 + HSPCs ex vivo especially supporting a CD34 + CD90 + subpopulation with potentially high stem cell activity. Moreover, a potential role of MCAM in this context may offer new perspectives of the HSPC expansion ex vivo for the improvement of HSCT. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
