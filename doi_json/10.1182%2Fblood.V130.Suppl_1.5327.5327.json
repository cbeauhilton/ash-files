    "abstract_text": "Background T-large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL) is a rare and heterogeneous lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the chronic proliferation of clonal Large Granular Lymphocytes (LGLs) with cytotoxic activity. Usually, leukemic cells of this T-cell neoplasia express the \u03b1\u03b2 T-cell receptor (TCR); only a small subset of cases expresses the \u03b3\u03b4 TCR denoting the TCR\u03b3\u03b4-LGLL. Currently, among the different LGL diseases, TCR\u03b3\u03b4-LGLL remains less studied and several clinical and laboratory data already described in TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL have not yet been explored in TCR\u03b3\u03b4-LGLL. In particular, data are still missing about STAT3 and STAT5b mutations, frequently observed in TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL, and about T-LGL clonotypes discovered to be private to TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL as compared to healthy controls. Aims This work was aimed to perform the analysis on: STAT3 and STAT5b mutations, LGL immunophenotype, TCR\u03b3 clonotype repertoire and clinical presentations in a group of TCR\u03b3\u03b4-LGLL patients. The objective was to reveal common and different features of this rare kind of LGLL with the more frequent TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL. Methods The cohort of study included 11 patients affected by TCR\u03b3\u03b4-LGLL. Sanger sequencing was used for mutational analysis on hot-spot regions of the 2 genes more frequently mutated in LGL disorders, STAT3 and STAT5b . Immunophenotype of LGL clone was defined by flow cytometry analysis. CDR3 repertoire and frequency distribution of TCR gamma gene rearrangements were obtained by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Results TCR\u03b3\u03b4-LGLL showed a higher occurrence of STAT mutations (82%) as compared to TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL (43%). In detail, 9 out of 11 TCR\u03b3\u03b4 LGLL patients were characterized by STAT3 or STAT5b mutations in a mutually exclusive pattern. Being characterized by both STAT3 and STAT5b mutations, TCR\u03b3\u03b4 LGLL resembles both CD8+ TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL and CD4+ TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL, the first being mostly associated to STAT3 mutations and the latter to STAT5b . Similarly, TCR\u03b3\u03b4-LGLL showed the same relationship observed between immunophenotype and kind of mutation in TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL: TCR\u03b3\u03b4-LGLL patients with CD56- LGL immunophenotype were characterized by STAT3 mutations (as in CD8+ TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL), while TCR\u03b3\u03b4-LGLL patients with CD56+ LGL immunophenotype by STAT5b mutations (as in CD4+ TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL). Anyway, in TCR\u03b3\u03b4-LGLL no correlation was found between mutations and clinical course as observed in CD8+ TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL patients carrying STAT mutations, rather, we observed that patients with \u03b3\u03b4LGLs positive for V\u03b42 showed frequently indolent course, while V\u03b41 was associated to a more symptomatic disease (4 out of 5 symptomatic patients were V\u03b41+). By NGS we obtained the TCR gamma repertoire of each patient and we revealed that all patients were clonal with the exception of 2 showing a polyclonal pattern. The 2 polyclonal cases were the only 2 patients without STAT mutations. Among the remaining STAT3 mutated patients (n=4), 3 were polyclonal and one biclonal, while STAT5b mutated patients (n=5) were more frequently monoclonal (4/5 monoclonal and 1/5 biclonal). Considering the CDR3 repertoire of the immunodominant clones, as observed in TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL, common clonotype sequences were present with low frequency in almost all TCR\u03b3\u03b4-LGLL patients. Interestingly, 2 different CDR3 sequences were found shared in different patients at frequency >10% of the total rearrangements. In terms of clonal rearrangements, V\u03b33-J\u03b31/2, V\u03b39-J\u03b3P and V\u03b38-J\u03b31/2 were the combination usages most frequently detected, showing a limited combinatorial diversity of TCR genes similarly to CD4+ and differently from CD8+ TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL, this last having larger variability. Analysis about the clonotype repertoire in a 2 years-follow up showed that patients maintain their clonal pattern along the time. Conclusions Our results highlight common and different characteristics of TCR\u03b3\u03b4-LGLL as compared to TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL. The data suggest that TCR\u03b3\u03b4-LGLL can be considered the intersection of the 2 types of TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL, sharing CD8+ or CD4+ T-LGLL mutational and phenotype features. Similarly to TCR\u03b1\u03b2-LGLL, also TCR\u03b3\u03b4 disease showed a decreased diversity of TCR repertoire, with common TCR sequences shared among patients and with limited number of V\u03b3-J\u03b3 combinations. A distinctive feature of TCR\u03b3\u03b4-LGLL is that STAT mutations do not correlate with a symptomatic clinical behavior, rather, V\u03b41 expression appears to be indicative for symptomatic disease.
