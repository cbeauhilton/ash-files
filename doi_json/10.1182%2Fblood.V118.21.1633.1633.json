    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1633 Introduction: The individual collection of epitopes within the variable regions of the unique immunoglobulin expressed by every mature B-cell lymphoma (idiotype, or Id) represents a tumor-specific antigen and lends itself as a target for therapeutic vaccination strategies. Immunization with tumor Id has the capacity to elicit polyclonal antibody responses as well as CD8 + and CD4 + T cells recognizing Id-derived peptides presented on class I and class II HLA molecules, respectively. Due to a perceived low immunogenicity of lymphoma-derived Id, most Id vaccines tested in clinical trials so far have been formulated as conjugates with the strongly immunogenic carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). In contrast, we have consistently observed high rates of humoral and cellular anti-Id immune responses in consecutive trials of active immunization with unconjugated recombinant Fab fragments of Id in indolent B-cell lymphomas (Bertinetti et al., Cancer Res. 2006; Navarrete et al., BLOOD 2011). We therefore hypothesized that Id Fab fragment might be intrinsically more immunogenic than entire Id Ig and tested this hypothesis by comparative in vitro experiments. Methods: Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) where loaded with human monoclonal IgG, papain-digested Fab fragments, Fc fragments, or recombinant lymphoma-derived Fab fragments. Functional DC phenotypes were assessed by flow cytometry of crucial maturation and activation markers. IL-10 and IL-12 was measured in DC culture supernatants by ELISA. Antigen-loaded DC where subsequently used for priming of CFSE-labeled autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Stimulated T cell populations were analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry. Results: Loading of DC with Fab, Fc, IgG, or mixtures of Fab and Fc fragments did not alter surface expression of CD11c, CD80, CD83, CD86, HLA-DR, PDL-1 and PDL-2 on DC. Likewise, the various antigens did not influence the cytokine release by DC during the loading or maturation process. DC loaded with isolated Fab fragments induced significantly higher proliferation of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells than undigested IgG. The mean proliferation rate of CD4 + cells stimulated with Fab fragments was 18.5% versus 5.6% for undigested IgG stimulation (p=0.021); proliferation rates of CD8 + cells were 14.2% versus 6.2% (p=0.034). These results were reproduced for 4 different monoclonal IgGs tested on 4 different donors. The addition of Fc fragments to Fab reduced the proliferation rates of CD4 + and CD8 + cells to 10.2% and 8.6% respectively. In addition, DC loaded with undigested IgG induced a relative increase in the number of CD25 high /FoxP3 + regulatory T cells compared with Fab stimulation (8.2% versus 1.4%; p<0.01). Conclusions: Isolated Fab fragments, i.e. the Id portions that contain the individual candidate antigenic epitopes of B-cell lymphomas, prime autologous T cells in vitro more efficiently than entire IgG. This finding is consistent with the high immune response rate against recombinant unconjugated Fab fragments observed in vivo in our clinical vaccination trials. Peptide sequences shared between Ig molecules that are predominantly located in the IgG Fc fragment appear to exert an inhibitory effect on T-cell priming. In accordance with our recent in vivo data in a syngeneic mouse model of Id vaccination (Warncke et al., Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2011), this effect may be mediated by effective activation of Treg. Fab fragments therefore appear to be the more immunogenic and therefore preferable Ig antigenic format for active anti-Id immunotherapy. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of IgG Fc offers a potential explanation for the recently reported lack of efficacy of Id vaccination in IgG-expressing follicular lymphomas in a randomized phase III trial, in which patients with IgM-expressing lymphomas, in contrast, had a significant benefit from Id vaccination in intention-to-treat analyses (Schuster et al., JCO 2011).
