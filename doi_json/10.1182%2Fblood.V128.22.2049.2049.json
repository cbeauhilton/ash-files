    "abstract_text": "Background: A major aim of treatment in CLL is to eradicate detectable minimal residual disease (MRD). Ibrutinib is a major step forward in the treatment of CLL but results in an immediate lymphocytosis that persists in most patients for at least several months. Obinutuzumab is a second generation anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody which appears to be highly effective in CLL resulting in a rapid eradication of peripheral blood lymphocytosis and the eradication of MRD in a proportion of patients. The IcICLLe Extension Study expands on the IcICLLe trial (ISRCTN 12695354) to examine the efficacy and safety of the combination treatment of obinutuzumab and ibrutinib. Patients: The IcICLLetrial recruited 40 participants with CLL requiring treatment (20 treatment-na\u00efve, 20 relapsed/refractory disease) receive continuous ibrutinib therapy until achievement of 20 will have had no prior Ibrutinib treatment (ibrutinib naive), and \u226420 will have received at least 12 months of Ibrutinib monotherapy as part of the IcICLLe trial before enrolling in the Extension Study . Adverse Events (AEs) are collected from registration until 30 days after treatment cessation and reported at 1, 3 and 6 months, and 6-monthly thereafter using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0. Results: 17 participants (12 ibrutinib na\u00efve and 5 IcICLLe monotherapy patients) are evaluable for response assessment after one month of combination treatment. In the 12 Ibrutinib-na\u00efve cases, the peripheral CLL counts remained at or below baseline levels in most (9/12) cases from week 1 onwards. After one month of combination therapy the peripheral B-cell count was a median 35% of baseline levels (range <1% to 174%) compared to a median 215% (range 29% to 3570%) for relapsed/refractory patients on Ibrutinib monotherapy. The percentage of CLL cells in the bone marrow aspirate for patients after 1 month of combination therapy showed a median 20% reduction (range 1% increase to 55% decrease, paired t-test P<0.001, baseline median 74% CLL cells, range 23-94%) while there was no change for relapsed/refractory patients on ibrutinib monotherapy (median 1% increase, range 39% increase to 24% decrease, paired t-test P=0.35, baseline median 85% CLL cells, range 11-96%). The reduction in bone marrow aspirate CLL percentage was also evident by morphological assessment of the trephine biopsy with all 10 evaluable patients showing improvements in the cellularity and/or extent of infiltration. Bone marrow assessment was not mandated for the 5 patients previously on \u226512 months (range 14-20 months) continuous ibrutinib monotherapy because they had already undergone 4 biopsies in the prior year, however all five patients showed a reduction in peripheral CLL counts (median 1.3 log reduction, range 0.3 to 2.4 log) which was significantly greater than the reduction seen in the prior 6 months of ibrutinib monotherapy (median 0.5 log reduction, range -1.0 to 0.8, paired t-test P=0.043) Of the 17 participants recruited to the IcICLLe Extension Study there have been no reports of Tumour Lysis Syndrome within the first month of combination treatment. There was a single report of a grade 2 Infusion Related Reaction (IRR) for one participant following the first infusion (100mg) of obinutuzumab. No further IRRs have been reported. Conclusions: The data indicate that the addition of obinutuzumab to ibrutinib results in a substantial improvement in the depletion of CLL cells from the peripheral blood and bone marrow after only one month of combination therapy.
