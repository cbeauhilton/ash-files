    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3990 Poster Board III-926 Background In 2005, the first ever Citizen Petition filed by a State Attorneys General, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, requested that the FDA adopt 6 measures to improve VTE prophylaxis and patient safety of thalidomide (thal). While 4 recommendations were accepted, the FDA refused to mandate a Phase IV randomized, controlled trial designed to identify the best VTE prophylaxis stating that substantial data already existed, but no specific prophylaxis was identified. We review the progress of this safety concern pre- and post-FDA approval of thal in 2006, specifically for the use of multiple myeloma patients. Similar safety concerns apply to lenalidomide. Methods A literature search was performed from 2006 to 2009 through Pubmed and Ovid using the key words \u201cthalidomide,\u201d \u201clenalidomide,\u201d \u201cthrombosis,\u201d and \u201cmultiple myeloma.\u201d High dose thal was defined as higher than 200mg/d, low dose thal as 200mg/d or lower, and high dose dexamethasone (dex) as higher than 20mg/d and low dose dex as 20mg/d and lower.

VTE rates remain high, except for the low dose thal and/or low dose dex group. Overall, optimal VTE prophylaxis remains an enigma. Current recommendations for VTE prophylaxis are not supported by empirical data. Against this backdrop, Blumenthal's team should consider resubmitting their safety request.
