    "abstract_text": "Introduction Due to advances in cancer treatment the majority of young adults diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma become long-term survivors. These individuals have been shown to have higher pregnancy risks as a result of cancer and treatment exposure. Adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage and premature delivery may impact survivor's reproductive concerns after cancer. We hypothesized that reproductive-aged female leukemia and lymphoma survivors who experienced miscarriage or premature birth after cancer would have higher reproductive concerns as compared to female leukemia and lymphoma survivors who did not have an adverse pregnancy outcome after cancer. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of young adult female leukemia and lymphoma survivors with at least one pregnancy after cancer, who are participants of the Reproductive Window study. Study participants were recruited between March 2015 and December 2017 from population-based cancer registries (California and Texas), physician and advocacy group referrals. Eligible women were age 18 to 40 at enrollment, age 15-35 at cancer diagnosis, and had at least one ovary. Enrolled participants answered a questionnaire on pregnancy outcomes and reproductive concerns using the Reproductive Concerns After Cancer (RCAC) Scale. The exposure was adverse pregnancy outcome (miscarriage or premature birth). The outcomes were RCAC subscales measuring concerns regarding becoming pregnant in the future and personal and offspring health. Subscale scores were dichotomized at 3, with >3 indicating moderate to severe reproductive concerns. Logistic regression models were used to test the association between an adverse pregnancy outcome (miscarriage or preterm birth) and RCAC subscales of interest, while adjusting for confounding Results 76 participants, mean age 34.3\u00b13.9 years and mean years since cancer diagnosis 12.0\u00b1 5.8 years were included. The majority of participants were white (80%), completed college (72%) and were partnered (87%). Thirty eight percent of participants reported an adverse pregnancy outcome after cancer (18% miscarriage, 21% premature delivery). Thirty-two percent reported moderate to severe concerns about becoming pregnant in the future, 60% regarding offspring health, and 46% over personal health. History of miscarriage after cancer, but not preterm birth, was associated with higher concerns about becoming pregnant. In a multivariable model that adjusted for Hispanic ethnicity, current age, and live birth after cancer, participants who experienced a miscarriage after cancer were more likely to have moderate to high concerns about becoming pregnant in the future (adjusted OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.05-15.5, p=0.042) compared to participants with no history of miscarriage. Neither adverse pregnancy outcomes was associated with concerns about offspring or personal health. Conclusions In the cohort of young adult female leukemia and lymphoma survivors, experiencing a miscarriage after cancer was associated with higher concerns regarding becoming pregnant in the future. Additional research is needed to determine whether interventions such as preconception counseling with consideration of prior cancer treatments may help manage these concerns and improve pregnancy outcomes.
