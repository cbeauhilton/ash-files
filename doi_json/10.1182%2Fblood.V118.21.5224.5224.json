    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5224 Background: Even though one great study had been addressed for identifying relationship Camphylobacter jejuni (C.jejuni) and IPSID, association is not proof for causation; it is usually the first step in proving the microbial etiology of a disease. Intestinal-marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (I-MZL) in Korean result, many points of clinical presentations were quietly different from classical IPSID. Median age was about 60 not a young child, common involving site was ileo-cecal valve not a jejunum, limited segmental involvement was dominant not a diffuse involvement of whole intestine. Therefore, we propose this study for identifying the causative etiology of I-MZL. Thus firstly we planned to demonstrate the enterobacterias including C.jejuni and I-MZL with Korean specimen. Patients and Methods: Histologically confirmed 33 patients of intestinal MZL were evaluated for this study. DNA preparing from FFPE will be used Ambion RecoverAllTM Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit for FFPE tissue. Universal primers PB (5'TAACACATGCAAGTCGAACG3') and DG74 5'AGGAGGTGATCCAACCGCA3') has been used to amplify bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Established primers directed at C. jejuni (CCCJ609F 5'AATCTAATGGCTTAACCATTA3' and CCJ1442R 5'GTAACTAGTTTAGTATTCCGG3') will be used to generate an 852-bp 16S rDNA amplification. Cycling conditions for all PCR will be as follows: 7 minutes at 95\u00b0C, 35 cycles of denaturation for 30 seconds at 95\u00b0C, annealing for 20 seconds at 55\u00b0C, and 2 minutes of extension at 72\u00b0C and then 10 minutes at 72\u00b0C.With the similar concept, Salmonella typi, Vibrio Cholerae, Escherichia coli, Shigella also were evaluated for evaluating the etiology of the I-MZL. Result: Between 1999 and October 2009, a total of 24 patients with histological diagnosis of I-MZL from 9 different institutions in Korea were analyzed. The male/female ratio was 14 to 10. The median age was 57 years (range, 15\u201380). The number of involved site was duodenum-1, jejunum- 2, ileum-7, ileo-cecal valve-3, ascending colon-2, sigmoid colon-1, rectum- 5, and multiple intestine involvement was 3. Four bands were appeared in I-MZL patient. All of two jejunum involved MZL tissue had positive result. But one patient was ileum and the other one was ileo-cecal valve involved MZL. Salmonella typi, Vibrio Cholerae, Escherichia coli, Shigella were all negative in I-MZL tissue Conclusion: It was a difficult to identify the relationship several enterobacterias and I-MZL. However C. jejuni could be a possibility of etiologic organism of jejunum involved MZL. Furthermore, extra-jejunum I-MZL has a need for more investigation to define the etiology of I-MZL Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
