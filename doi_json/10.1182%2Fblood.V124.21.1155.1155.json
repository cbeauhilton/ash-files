    "abstract_text": "Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (aHCT) is curative for a number of pediatric nonmalignant disorders. Toxicities related to conditioning, failure of engraftment, and GVHD remain obstacles to successful transplantation for these patients. Since 2000, our institution has prospectively studied busulfan/fludarabine (Bu/Flu)-based conditioning regimens with a goal to reduce complications associated with myeloablative conditioning while maintaining adequate, stable donor-derived hematopoiesis. While overall survival has remained excellent, graft failure rates remain high. Therefore, we performed a retrospective analysis to identify risk factors for graft failure in patients receiving Bu/Flu-based conditioning. In addition, we report results for second aHCTs following graft failure. Methods: Since 2000, our institution has performed 74 aHCTs with Bu/Flu-based conditioning for nonmalignant disorders. The most common diagnoses include Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (n = 10), thalassemia (n = 9), Hurler syndrome (n = 7), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) (n = 6), sickle cell disease (n = 5), and aplastic anemia (n = 5). Three aHCTs were excluded due to relapse of the underlying disease (e.g. HLH) despite > 90% donor chimerism. Conditioning included a backbone of busulfan and fludarabine as previously described (Law J, et al , Biol Blood Marrow Transplant, 2012). Starting in 2012, four doses of clofarabine 10 mg/m2 (0.33 mg/kg for patients < 12 kg) were added for recipients of mismatched unrelated donors (MMUD). In addition, conditioning included either rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) or alemtuzumab. Results: Twelve graft failures (17%) occurred between day +18 and +445 (median +66). Of the variables analyzed, only donor chimerism for whole blood and the CD3 subset were significantly correlated with graft failure (CD14/15 and CD19 subsets were not). Cord blood aHCTs were excluded from conditioning analysis since these transplantations exclusively used rATG rather than alemtuzumab. Table 1: Risk Factors for Graft Failure  . Durable Engraftment .

In our cohort, low early donor chimerism was significantly correlated with increased graft failure. Close monitoring and early interventions may benefit patients at high risk for graft failure. Notably, there was a trend towards reduction in graft failure with alemtuzumab (9%) compared to rATG (26%), which did not reach statistical significance possibly due to insufficient power. While graft failure remains an issue with Bu/Flu-based conditioning, rescue with second transplantation is feasible with a reasonable chance for success.
