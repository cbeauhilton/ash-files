    "abstract_text": "p53 action and the consequences of p53 mutation in acute myeloid leukemia TP53 mutations are common in treatment associated myeloid neoplasia (tMN) and complex karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (CK-AML), where they are associated with chemoresistance and one of the worst prognoses of any leukemia genotype. To understand the impact of TP53 mutations on AML biology, we are performing arge scale genomic analyses of p53 mutant AML and have produced a series of animal models that appear to faithfully reflect molecular and biological features of the human disease. We have gone on to explore the biology of particular TP53 mutational configurations drive AML initiation and maintenance, and to identify and understanding the events that cooperate with p53 mutations during leukemogenesis.
