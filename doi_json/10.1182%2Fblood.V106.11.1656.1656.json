    "abstract_text": "The first steps in the biogenesis of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 involve the individual synthesis of each subunit within the endoplasmic reticulum, followed by complex formation. Previous studies performed in HEL cells and in megakaryocyte-lineage cells cultured from cryopreserved progenitor cells of patients with CML have led to conflicting data with regard to whether \u03b1IIb or \u03b23 is produced in limiting amounts that might then control complex formation. To study this question in greater detail, we conducted immunoprecipitation studies on HEK293 cells transfected with \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 cDNAs and megakaryocyte-lineage cells derived from human umbilical cord blood grown in the presence of thrombopoietin and IL-11. Cells were labeled for 15 min with 35 S-methionine/cysteine, and then lysed after 2 hr with a 1% triton X-100 buffer. The antibodies employed included murine monoclonal antibodies 10E5 (anti-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 complex, which, reacts with \u03b1IIb cap domain), 7E3 (anti-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 + \u03b1v\u03b23, which reacts with \u03b23 specificity-determining loop and \u03b11 helix), AP-5 (LIBS anti-\u03b23, which reacts with \u03b23 amino acids 1 - 6), 7H2 (anti-\u03b23, which reacts with PSI domain near C13), 1990 (anti-\u03b1IIb, which reacts at unknown site), and LIBS2 (LIBS anti-\u03b23, which reacts with a site within amino acids 602 \u2013 690). The relative amounts of pro-\u03b1IIb, mature \u03b1IIb, and \u03b23 immunoprecipitated by this panel of antibodies is shown in Table 1. Results were similar in both the HEK293 cells and in megakaryocyte-lineage cells derived from human umbilical cord blood. These data indicate that there are sizeable pools of both free pro-\u03b1IIb and free \u03b23 in both cell types, and thus neither subunit controls complex formation by limited availability. Based on the selective precipitation of pro-\u03b1IIb + \u03b23 by AP5, it appears that the pro-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 complex adopts a conformation similar to that of ligand-bound mature \u03b1IIb\u03b23. We conclude that \u03b1IIb\u03b23 complex formation is slow relative to the production of the individual subunits, and is probably controlled either by the ability of the subunits to adopt the proper fold and/or to interact with a chaperone(s) that facilitates complex formation. Assuming that AP5 selectively recognizes \u03b1IIb\u03b23 complexes in which the angle of the \u03b23 \u03b2A (I-like) domain - hybrid domain interface results in separation of the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 leg domains, these data also suggest that \u03b1IIb\u03b23 head-head interactions precede \u03b1IIb\u03b23 leg-leg interactions during biogenesis, and that \u03b1IIb maturation occurs rapidly after \u03b1IIb\u03b23 leg-leg interactions. Such a model is consistent with our previous data demonstrating that pro-\u03b1IIb binds to the ER membrane-resident chaperone calnexin via the N-linked glycan at \u03b1IIb N15. Table 1  Antibody .
