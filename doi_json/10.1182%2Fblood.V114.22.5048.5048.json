    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5048 EVI1 gene was first identified as a common site of retroviral integration in murine leukemia models. This gene is part of a complex genomic locus, MDS1-EVI1, that has been described as a target for retroviral integration that may lead to the emergence of a non-malignant dominant hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) clone in mice, in primates, and in humans. These studies suggested that one of the genes encoded by this locus could affect the self-renewal potential of HSC. Recent studies in mice revealed that indeed EVI1 plays an essential role in cell proliferation and it also enhances the self-renewal ability of HSC. The intense attention focused on the MDS1-EVI1 locus as retrovirus integration site prompted us to investigate whether EVI1 might have a role in somatic cell re-programming generated with retroviruses. Recent developments in stem cell research have enabled the re-programming of somatic cells to a pluripotent state using exogenous factors. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have the potential to differentiate into any cells types and that might be used in the future for clinical therapy. In order to elucidate the molecular events allowing the conversion of adult somatic into pluripotent stem cell, we evaluated EVI1 expression during this process. We found that EVI1 is activated in the early stages of re-programming and then it is silenced once the cells has been fully re-programmed. EVI1 seems to facilitate the initiation of cell re-programming by up-regulating a subset of genes previously described as potent stimulators of stem cells expansion.
