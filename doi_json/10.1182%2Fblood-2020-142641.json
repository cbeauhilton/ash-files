    "abstract_text": "Background: Multiple myeloma is typically characterized by clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells within the bone marrow compartment. Presence of extramedullary disease (EMD) either in the form of soft tissue plasmacytoma or circulating plasma cells can be seen at diagnosis but is more common in the relapsed and refractory patients. Presence of EMD is typically associated with a poor prognosis, both in the newly diagnosed and relapsed setting, but trials designed specifically for patients with EMD are sparse. Treatment of EMD can be challenging and the responses even when seen are often short lasting, highlighting the need for developing specific treatment approaches aimed at these patients. Based on initial trials suggesting activity of pomalidomide in the setting of EMD and the increased tissue distribution with the oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib, we designed this trial to examine if the all oral combination of ixazomib, pomalidomide and dexamethasone can be effective in the setting of EMD. Patients and Methods: Patients with previously treated multiple myeloma, with adequate hematologic and organ function were enrolled if there was evidence, at study entry, of EMD defined as one or more plasmacytomas, outside the bone marrow that were non-contiguous with a bone lesion and had a single diameter of \u22652 cm OR as plasma cell leukemia, with circulating plasma cells > 5% of peripheral blood leukocytes or at least 0.5 X 10 9 /L or 200 cells/150000 events by flowcytometry. Patients were treated on 28-day cycles, with ixazomib 4 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 along with pomalidomide 4 mg PO daily on days 1-21 and dexamethasone 40 milligrams weekly until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The goals of the study were to determine confirmed response rate (\u2265 PR), toxicities of this combination, differential response rates and progression-free survival (PFS). Confirmed response rate, differential response rates and PFS were estimated using Duffy and Santner approach, exact binomial distributions and Kaplan Meier curves, respectively. The study was designed to accrue 30 patients. Results: This study was designed to enroll up to 30 patients but was closed after enrolling 17 patients due to slow accrual. The baseline characteristics are as indicated in Table 1. Eleven patients were enrolled with an extramedullary plasmacytoma while the remaining six patients had plasma cell leukemia. Median number of lines of prior therapy was 3 (range: 1, 7). Overall, 10 (58.8%) patients had progressive disease and 11 (64.7%) patients have died, median (range) follow-up for the live patients is 22.2 (2.1, 37.9) months. Patients were treated for a median of 2 (range 1-34) cycles. A grade 3+ AE, at least possibly attributed, was seen in 53%. Grade 3+, at least possibly related, hematologic toxicity was noted in 41%, with 29% experiencing grade 3+ neutropenia. Notable grade 3+ non-hematologic toxicities (regardless of attribution), with >10% incidence rate were anemia, hypoxia, infections and lung infection. The confirmed response rate in evaluable patients was 35% (1 CRs and 5 PRs), with a 90% CI of 6% - 37%. While 33% (4/12; 95% CI: 1-8%) of patients reported a biochemical response, 40% (2/5; 95% CI: 0-4%) of patients reported an extramedullary response. The median PFS was 4.5 (95% CI: 2-11.8) months. Conclusions: The combination of ixazomib, pomalidomide and dexamethasone resulted in disease response in a third of this group of high-risk patients with EMD; however, the responses were not very durable, with a median PFS of only 4.5 months. The trial highlights the feasibility of doing clinical trials specifically targeted towards this high-risk patient population. Future trials should explore combinations of novel agents, including monoclonal antibodies through multicenter collaborative efforts.
