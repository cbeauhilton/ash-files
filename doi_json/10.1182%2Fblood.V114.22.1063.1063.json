    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1063 Poster Board I-85 ALX-0681 is a humanized bivalent Nanobody \u00ae , that binds to the A1 domain of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and hence blocks its interaction with platelet receptor GPIb-IX-V. Given its mode of action, ALX-0681 could provide an alternative treatment option for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a rare and life-threatening condition characterized by systemic platelet aggregation in the microcirculation mediated by activated vWF multimers. The goal of this Phase I trial in healthy volunteers was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or biologically effective dose (BED) and the Phase II dosing and scheduling of ALX-0681, in order to support the further clinical development of ALX-0681 in TTP patients. In total, 36 healthy volunteers were included in this randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety of single ascending doses and multiple doses of ALX-0681 administered subcutaneously (s.c.) ( Table 1 ). Table 1 Dosing schedule for Phase I trial with ALX-0681  Cohort . Dose (mg) . Number of daily doses . Subjects receiving ALX-0681 . Subjects receiving placebo .

The latter endpoint was addressed by measuring the ristocetin cofactor (RICO) biomarker, reflecting vWF mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. ALX-0681 was safe and well tolerated at all dose levels ( Table 2 ). One unrelated SAE (meniscus lesion) occurred. The number of observed signs of bleeding and bruises increased with increasing treatment duration. However, all these events were of mild intensity. No signs of immunogenicity were observed for a minimum of 45 days after the last injection. View Large Table 2 Summary of main safety results (number (%) of subjects with event)  Dose level .

All subjects dosed with ALX-0681 at 8 mg or higher showed complete inhibition of RICO activity to < 20% with an onset of 1-6 h post dose. This inhibition was maintained until 12-360 h post dose, depending on the dose level ( Table 3 ). Overall, 20 (74%) and 17 (63%) of ALX-0681 treated subjects experienced a drop in vWF and FVIII levels below 50% of pre-dose levels, respectively. These events were all transient and not clinically significant. View Large Table 3 Summary of main PD results (number (%) of subjects with event)  Dose level . Subjects ( n ) .

No local reactions, local intolerances or signs of clinically relevant bleeding were reported. The PD marker indicated complete inhibition of vWF mediated platelet aggregation following single daily s.c. injections of 10 mg, which was maintained over the 2 weeks treatment period. Multiple daily administration of s.c. injections of ALX-0681 did not result in an immunogenic reaction for a minimum of 45 days following completion of treatment. Based on the results of this study, ALX-0681 development will be advanced into a Phase II study in TTP patients to investigate the safety and efficacy of ALX-0681 in the target patient population.
