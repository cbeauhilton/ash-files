    "abstract_text": "Several new reduced intensity conditioning regimens are being investigated for allogeneic transplantation. To evaluate their effects in follicular lymphoma, we studied outcome of HLA-identical sibling transplants in 205 recipients reported to the CIBMTR between 1997 and 2002. Only patients without prior allogeneic or autologous transplantation were included. Twenty-seven patients (13%) had follicular large cell (grade III) lymphoma; the remaining had grade I or II disease. 27% had chemotherapy-resistant disease and 32% had poor performance status prior to transplantation. Conditioning regimens were categorized as myeloablative (ABLAT; n=120) or reduced intensity (RIC; n=85). ABLAT was defined as total body irradiation (TBI) containing regimens with single fraction of \u2265500 cGy, fractionated doses of \u2265 800 cGy, busulfan doses >9 mg/kg or melphalan doses >150 mg/m 2 . We defined RIC as TBI doses <500 cGy, busulfan doses <9 mg/kg, melphalan doses of \u2264150 mg/m 2 and fludarabine regimens without busulfan or melphalan. 70% of ABLAT was TBI based; 24% was busulfan-cyclophosphamide. Melphalan based regimens were used in 23% of RIC, reduced dose busulfan in 21%, fludarabine-cyclophosphamide in 41% and low dose TBI in 7%. RIC constituted fewer than 10% of transplants reported in 1997, about 50% in 2000 and 80% in 2002. Median recipient age was 45 y (28\u201370y) for ABLAT vs. 50 y (27\u201367y) for RIC (p<0.001). Median time from diagnosis to transplant was 24 mo for ABLAT vs. 34 mo for RIC (p=0.001). PBSC was used for 65% of ABLAT but 92% of RIC (p<0.001). GVHD prophylaxis included a calcineurin antagonist in all patients, but was combined with MTX in 86% of ABLAT compared to 54% of RIC (p<0.001). Median follow-up of survivors was 49 mo for ABLAT vs. 36 mo for RIC (p=0.004). In univariate analysis, there were no differences in acute or chronic GVHD, treatment-related mortality (TRM), progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) between the two groups. The median hospital stay was slightly shorter for RIC vs. ABLAT (25 vs. 28 days, p=0.05), and there was a trend toward an increased risk of disease recurrence after RIC (p=0.09). Forty ABLAT recipients and 30 RIC recipients have died. Eleven of 40 deaths with ABLAT transplant vs 2 of 30 with RIC were attributed to organ failure (p=0.03); 5 and 4 deaths, respectively, were attributed to GVHD (p=NS), and 8 and 11 deaths, respectively, to relapse (p=NS). In multivariate analysis, performance score and chemotherapy sensitivity were independently associated with TRM, OS and PFS, but conditioning regimen was not. There was a trend for increased risk of recurrence after RIC (RR=1.91; p=0.09). In summary, RIC is now, by far, the most common approach for allotransplantation in follicular lymphoma. In this analysis, TRM, GVHD, OS and PFS after RIC are similar to ABLAT.  Outcomes . ABLAT (%) . RIC (%) .
