    "abstract_text": "Background We have previously reported a novel primary immunodeficiency syndrome caused by a mutation in the 3\u2019 untranslated region of the gene p14 (also known as late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor, MAPK and MTOR activator 2; LAMTOR2 ) resulting in impaired endosomal biogenesis (Bohn et al, Nature Medicine 2007). The p14-deficient patients are characterized by congenital neutropenia associated with growth failure, partial albinism, as well as B cell and cytotoxic T cell deficiency. Here, we studied the role of the endosomal adaptor protein p14 in hematopoieses using a Cre/ loxP -based conditional knockout mouse model. Methods We have generated a conditional Mx1Cre-p14 flox/flox (p14 -/- ) mouse model, in which postnatal deletion of p14 can be induced by intraperitoneal injection of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (pIpC, 5 x 250 \u00b5g, every other day). The hematopoietic system of p14 -/- mice was analyzed by tissue sections, flow cytometry, biochemical assays, and electron microscopy studies. Hematopoietic stem cells were analyzed by competitive transplantation studies and in vitro colony-forming unit assays. Results p14 -/- mice die 3 - 6 weeks after treatment with pIpC. Disruption of p14 was associated with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and moderate leukocytosis in the peripheral blood. Pathological examination of p14 -/- mice revealed a splenomegaly and myeloproliferative infiltrations in the bone marrow and spleen. Flow cytometric analysis of p14-deficient nucleated bone marrow cells showed a massive expansion of immature myelomonocytic cells (Gr-1 low CD11b + , pre-M), whereas the granulocytic (Gr-1 high CD11b + ), B cell (CD19 + B220 + ), and erythroid (TER-119 + ) lineages were severely reduced. Similarly, FACS analysis revealed a remarkable accumulation of the pre-M population in the spleen, whereas the erythroid lineage was increased at various developmental stages as determined by expression of TER-119 and CD71, indicating enhanced extramedullary hematopoiesis. Immunophenotypic characterization of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment showed a significant depletion of long-term HSCs (lin - Sca-1 + c-kit + CD150 + CD48 - ) accompanied by an increase in the proportion of short-term HSCs (lin - Sca-1 + c-kit + CD150 + CD48 + ) and multipotent progenitors (lin - Sca-1 + c-kit + CD150 - CD48 + ). BrdU incorporation assays documented enhanced cycling of lin - Sca-1 + c-kit + cells (LSK) 4 days after pIpC injection. Transcriptome analysis detected a strong enrichment of myeloid-specific and a loss of \u201cstemness\u201d gene sets within the p14-deficient LSK gene signature. Bone marrow transplantation studies showed that the p14-deficient bone marrow cells are less competent in repopulating lethally irradiated mice and that the phenotype of myeloid hyperplasia in p14 -/- mice is transplantable and caused by cell-intrinsic effects. As a potential pathomechanism for the myeloproliferative phenotype in p14 -/- mice we documented an altered cytokine receptor-mediated signaling in p14-deficient hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). Whereas p14-deficient HPC exhibited an increased response to GM-CSF and IL-3 with respect to ERK1/2 phosphorylation and colony formation, G-CSF signaling was substantially impaired corroborating with the decreased frequency of granulocytic Gr-1 high CD11b + cells in p14 -/- mice. Conclusion Our data suggest that conditional deletion of p14 in mice causes a myeloproliferative disorder associated with increased sensitivity of HPC to GM-CSF receptor-mediated signaling.
