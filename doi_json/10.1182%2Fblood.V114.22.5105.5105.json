    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5105 A-14 years-old man, admitted to our clinic with weakness and paleness since one month. He has hepatosplenomegaly. Blood tests and peripheral blood smear showed anemia that severe hypochromic, microcytic anemia. There is ringed sideroblasts without dysplastic hematopoiesis in bone marrow cytology. Liver tests were normal. A liver biopsy showed heavy parenchymal iron deposition and grade-III fibrosis. Screening for HFE gene mutations was negative. MR imaging demonstrated that severe iron accumulation in liver and heart. ALAS2 gene screening showed that novel mutation in exon 7 (Gly390Gly, c.1170, C\u25a1T). Eventually, was diagnosed as sideroblastic anemia and hemochromatosis. He was treated successfully with pyridoxine and chelating agent (deferasirox, IGL-670). The findings suggest that the Gly390Gly in ALAS2 mutation causes sideroblastic anemia and hemochromatosis, without hereditary hemochromatosis gene mutations. This mutation cause sideroblastic anemia is clinically pyridoxine-responsive. Deferasirox is effective agent for reduce hepatic iron loading in this condition. Disclosures Off Label Use: deferasiroks was used for hemochromatosis secondary to congenital syderoblastic anemia.",
