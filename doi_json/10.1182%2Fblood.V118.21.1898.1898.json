    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1898 Protein kinase C theta (PKC\u03b8), a T cell signaling molecule, has been implicated as a therapeutic target for several autoimmune diseases as well as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). PKC\u03b8 plays a vital role in stabilization of the immunologic synapse between T effector cells and antigen presenting cells (APC), but has been shown to be excluded from the immunologic synapse in T regulatory cells (T reg). PKC\u03b8 inhibition reduces the alloreactivity of donor T cells responsible for induction of GVHD while preserving graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) responses. The roles of PKC\u03b8 and the potential compensatory alpha isoform (PKC\u03b1) are not clearly defined with regard to alloresponses or T cell mediated responses in GVHD. In this context, we measured PKC\u03b8 and PKC\u03b1/\u03b8 gene deficient T cell activation upon TCR-ligation in vitro using [3H]-TdR incorporation and CSFE labeling assays. T cells from PKC\u03b8 and PKC\u03b1/\u03b8 gene deficient donor mice were utilized in vivo in a pre-clinical allogenic murine model of myeloablative bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The development of GVHD was monitored in recipient mice with or without injection of A20-luciferase cells to observe the progression of GVL in vivo. Combined blockade of PKC\u03b1 and PKC\u03b8 causes a significant decrease in T cell proliferation compared to blocking PKC\u03b8 alone in vitro. Deficiency in PKC\u03b1 and PKC\u03b8 had no effect on immune reconstitution following irradiation and BMT in vivo. Even with a high transplant load of 5\u00d710 6 CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, PKC\u03b1/\u03b8 deficient (PKC\u03b1/\u03b8 \u2212/\u2212 ) T cells failed to induce acute GVHD. Our data suggest that the ability of double deficient T cells to induce GVHD was further reduced than PKC\u03b8-deficient T cells. Additionally, a greater number and percentage of B220+ B cells and FoxP3+ T regs were isolated from the spleens of PKC\u03b1/\u03b8 \u2212/\u2212 T cell recipient mice 120 after BMT than were isolated from wild type (WT) or PKC\u03b8 \u2212/\u2212 T cell recipients. Fewer CD4+ or CD8+ T effector cells were isolated from the spleens of PKC\u03b1/\u03b8 \u2212/\u2212 T cell recipient mice 120 after BMT than were isolated from wild type or PKC\u03b8 \u2212/\u2212 T cell recipients. Importantly, the activity of B cells isolated from PKC\u03b1/\u03b8 \u2212/\u2212 T cell recipient mice 120 after BMT was greater on a per cell basis, while the activity of T effector cells isolated from these mice was greatly reduced compared to WT or PKC\u03b8 \u2212/\u2212 T cell recipients. While not absent, GVL was reduced in PKC\u03b1/\u03b8 \u2212/\u2212 T cell recipient mice when compared to WT or PKC\u03b8 \u2212/\u2212 T cell recipients. This work demonstrates the requirement of PKC\u03b1 and \u03b8 for optimal activation and function of T cells in vitro. These experiments highlight a potential compensatory role for PKC\u03b1 in the absence of PKC\u03b8 in T cell signaling and activation. Combined deficiency of PKC\u03b1 and \u03b8 prevents induction of acute GVHD while improving the maintenance of splenic cellularity in PKC\u03b1/\u03b8 T cell recipient mice. Additionally, PKC\u03b1/\u03b8 dual deficient T cell transplant shifts the splenic balance toward a greater number and percentage of T reg and B cells and away from T effector cells following BMT. The reduced and sub-optimally active T effector cells isolated from PKC\u03b1/\u03b8 \u2212/\u2212 T cell recipient mice in combination with reduced GVL stresses the importance of PKC\u03b1 and \u03b8 molecules and their roles in T cell activity in the context of both GVHD and GVL. Dual deficiency of PKC\u03b1/\u03b8 is associated with a decline of T effector function that is optimal for the amelioration of GVHD, but is perhaps too reduced to substantially maintain effective GVL. Modulation of PKC\u03b1 and \u03b8 signaling presents a valid avenue of investigation as a therapeutic option for GVHD. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
