    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND. Several studies have recently reported on the occurrence of a JAK2 V617F mutation in myeloid cells from the majority of patients with polycythemia vera (PV). The clinical relevance of this novel observation is currently under study. Similarly, there is limited information regarding the correlation of JAK2 V617F mutational status and neutrophil PRV-1 transcript level in PV, secondary polycythemia (SP) and other myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). METHODS. In a single institutional study, mutation screening for JAK2 V617F was performed in DNA derived from archived blood granulocytes from 63 consecutive patients with PV in whom current diagnostic criteria were strictly applied and diagnosis confirmed by bone marrow histology. Concomitant quantitative analysis of neutrophil PRV-1 expression was performed in 28 of the 63 patients and the results of both JAK2 V617F and PRV-1 analysis in these 28 patients were compared with those from another 22 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 10 with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM), 19 with SP, and 11 healthy volunteers. RESULTS. The 63 patients with PV were followed for a median of 33 months (range 3\u2013324) from the time of initial diagnosis. During this period, 3 patients have died including 2 from acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Disease transformation into either AML or MMM has occurred in 2 and 4 patients, respectively. The median time from diagnosis to the time of mutation analysis was 12 months (range 0\u2013306). JAK2 V617F was detected in 58 of the 63 patients with PV (92%; homozygous in 21%). The clinical phenotype of the 5 patients with wild-type allele was otherwise typical for the disease. A statistical comparison between JAK2 V617F heterozygotes (n=45) and homozygotes (n=13) in PV did not reveal significant associations in regards to age, gender, leukocyte or platelet count at diagnosis, disease duration, or the incidences of thrombosis or bleeding. However, JAK2 V617F homozygotes, compared to their heterozygote counterparts, displayed significantly higher hemoglobin level at diagnosis (p=0.001), increased incidence of pruritus (69% vs. 38%; p=0.04), and a higher rate of fibrotic transformation (23% vs. 2%; p=0.009). The overall (homozygous) JAK2 V617F mutational frequencies in the other study patients with ET, MMM, SP, and healthy controls were 55% (0%), 30% (0%), 0%, and 0%, respectively. The corresponding figures for increased PRV-1 expression in these patients were 18%, 20%, 21%, and 9% as compared to 89% in PV. In patients with either ET or MMM, the likelihood of detecting JAK2 V617F was significantly higher in the presence of an increased PRV-1 expression (83% vs. 38%; p=0.05). Similarly, in patients with PV, homozygous as compared to heterozygous JAK2 V617F correlated with higher levels of PRV-1 expression (p=0.07). CONCLUSIONS. The current clinical study demonstrates a mutant allele dose effect on erythrocytosis, PV-characteristic clinical features, and granulocyte PRV-1 expression in PV. Furthermore, compared to the PRV-1 assay, mutation screening for JAK2 V617F displayed greater specificity in distinguishing PV from SP.",
