    "abstract_text": "Background CD47 is an innate immune checkpoint that binds signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP\u03b1) and delivers a \"do not eat\" signal to suppress macrophage phagocytosis. Overexpression of CD47 can allow tumor cells to escape immune surveillance. TTI-621 (SIRP\u03b1Fc) is a fusion protein consisting of the CD47 binding domain of human SIRP\u03b1 linked to the Fc region of human IgG1, designed to enhance phagocytosis and antitumor activity by blocking the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 interaction between malignant cells and macrophages, and engaging Fc\u03b3 receptors. Here we report updates from the first-in-human study of TTI-621 (NCT02663518) in hematologic malignancies. Methods Study Part 1 tested increasing weekly intravenous doses of TTI-621 based on 3+3 escalation. The maximum tolerated dose was initially determined to be 0.2 mg/kg based on dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of thrombocytopenia [Grade (Gr) 4 of any duration]. Expanded testing followed in patients (pts) with hematologic malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. In Part 2, most pts received 0.2 mg/kg. However, based on investigator discretion, a subset of pts received escalating doses up to 0.5 mg/kg. In Part 3, pts with T-cell lymphomas received stepwise dose escalations from 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg over the first 5\u22128 weeks. In over 200 pts tested in Parts 1\u22123, thrombocytopenia did not increase with dose, typically recovered within 2\u22124 days, and was not associated with clinical sequelae. Part 4 was then undertaken to optimize TTI-621 dosing and is currently escalating doses in a 3+3 manner through pre-planned dose levels (0.5, 0.7, 1, and 1.4 mg/kg) in pts with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The DLT criteria was modified to require Gr 4 thrombocytopenia lasting >72 hours. Safety monitoring includes weekly clinical laboratories and assessments of adverse events (AEs) per CTCAE v 4.03. Blood samples are obtained for pharmacokinetics (PK) and for pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments of receptor occupancy (RO) on normal peripheral T cells. Disease assessments are performed per Olsen's criteria. Results In Parts 1\u22123 (n=214), the most common related AEs were infusion-related reaction (IRR, 43%; 3% Gr \u22653), thrombocytopenia (30%; 22% Gr \u22653), chills (21%; 0% Gr \u22653), and fatigue (15%; 1% Gr \u22653). Objective responses to single agent TTI-621 were achieved in 14/71 (20%) NHL pts including CTCL (n=42, 1 CR, 7 PRs), PTCL (n=22, 2 CRs, 2 PRs) and DLBCL (n=7, 1 CR, 1 PR). In Part 4, as of July 10, 2020, 15 pts (9M/6F, median age 67 years) have enrolled into 4 dose cohorts (0.5\u22121.4 mg/kg). CTCL subtypes include mycosis fungoides (MF, n=10) and S\u00e9zary syndrome (n=5) with advanced (\u2265IIB) disease in 9 (60%) pts who received a median of 3 (range 1\u221212) prior systemic therapies. Related AEs have occurred in 11 (73%) pts including IRR (n=10) and thrombocytopenia (n=3); Gr \u22653 AEs have occurred in 4 (27%) pts including thrombocytopenia (n=3), IRRs (n=2), and exfoliative dermatitis (n=1). Thrombocytopenia generally occurred on dosing days, recovered in 2-4 days, and has not worsened with increasing doses. IRRs typically occurred during initial infusions. The Gr 3 IRR events occurred in 2 pts in the 1 and 1.4 mg/kg cohorts; low Gr IRRs have occurred across doses in 8 pts. IRRs typically resolved without recurrence and low Gr events often resolved allowing for completion of infusions. For initial infusions, the Gr 3 IRRs prompted increasing infusion times from 1 hour up to 4 hours and discretional use of steroid pre-medication. The exfoliative dermatitis occurred Day 80 and led to treatment discontinuation in 1 pt with MF whose underlying disease confounded the etiology. PK results reveal dose dependent increases in exposure; PD studies indicate ~60% RO at end of infusion up to 1 mg/kg. Antitumor activity to date includes 1 PR and 1 skin CR in 6 evaluable pts in the 1 mg/kg cohort; 2 responding pts bridged to allogeneic transplantation. The mean % change in mSWAT scores were -0.4%, -27%, and -37% for 0.5, 0.7 and 1 mg/kg cohorts, respectively. 1.4 mg/kg cohort results will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions In Parts 1\u22123, TTI-621 doses of 0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg were well-tolerated and demonstrated single agent activity in multiple hematologic malignancies. Preliminary data from Part 4 dose optimization indicate that weekly infusions of TTI-621 up to 1.4 mg/kg are well-tolerated without dose limiting or cumulative thrombocytopenia. Antitumor activity was seen at 1 mg/kg; dose escalation is continuing at 2 mg/kg.
