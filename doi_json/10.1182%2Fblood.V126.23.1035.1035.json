    "abstract_text": "The interaction of the fibrinogen \u03b3 chain dodecapeptide (HHLGGAKQAGDV; \u03b312) with the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 binding pocket is required for fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and the binding of other \u03b1IIb\u03b23 ligands that contain RGD sequences such as von Willebrand factor and fibronectin. Since the strength of fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 increases over time, it is possible that there are additional sites of interaction between \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and fibrinogen, and several studies have proposed potential candidate ancillary sites on fibrinogen, including \u03b3316-322 and \u03b3370-381 (Podolnikova et al. JBC 289;2371,2014 and Remijn et al. Br J Haematol 117;650,2002). If such fibrinogen sites interact with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 at regions separate from the \u03b312 (RGD) binding site, these \u03b1IIb\u03b23 sites may be attractive targets for developing pure \u03b1IIb\u03b23 antagonists that are specific for fibrinogen. To identify potential additional interaction sites on fibrinogen and \u03b1IIb\u03b23, we studied adhesion of HEK293 cells expressing normal \u03b1IIb\u03b23 (\u03b1IIb\u03b23-HEK) to either fibrinogen or the D98 plasmin cleavage fragment of fibrinogen (which lacks \u03b312) in the presence of 2 mM Ca 2+ /1 mM Mg 2+ . The D98 fragment did not contain the \u03b312 peptide as judged by both immunoblotting with mAb 7E9 (anti-\u03b312) and mass spectroscopy. We also studied HEK293 cells expressing \u03b1IIb\u03b23 containing: 1. The double \u03b1IIb F992A + F993A mutations (\u03b1IIb-FF), which causes constitutive activation and ligand binding 2. Other activating mutations of \u03b1IIb\u03b23, including \u03b1IIb truncation at 991, \u03b23 N339S, and \u03b23 truncation at 717, 3. The \u03b23 D119A mutation, which disrupts the \u03b23 metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) and eliminates adhesion of cells expressing normal \u03b1IIb\u03b23 to fibrinogen, or 4. Combined \u03b1IIb FF and \u03b23 D119 mutations (FF+D119). \u03b1IIb\u03b23-HEK and \u03b1IIb-FF both bound to immobilized fibrinogen (10 \u00b5g/ml coating concentration). \u03b1IIb\u03b23-HEK did not adhere to immobilized D98 (10 \u00b5g/ml coating concentration), whereas \u03b1IIb-FF did adhere [\u03b1IIb\u03b23-HEK: 201 \u00b1 295 vs. \u03b1IIb-FF: 8,221 \u00b1 1,585 arbitrary fluorescence intensity units (AFU); n=7; p=0.003]. HEK cells expressing the other activating mutations also adhered to both fibrinogen and D98. HEK cells expressing the D119 mutation did not adhere to fibrinogen or D98 and adding the D119 mutation to the \u03b1IIb FF mutant led to loss of adhesion to both fibrinogen and D98. Adhesion of \u03b1IIb-FF to D98 was inhibited by mAb 10E5, which inhibits fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and binds to the \u03b1IIb cap domain (89% \u00b1 18%; n=7; p=0.003) and by mAb 7E3, which inhibits fibrinogen binding and binds to the \u03b23 subunits of both \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b23 (95% \u00b1 10%; n=7; p=0.006), but not by mAb 7E9 (28% \u00b1 29%; n=7; p=0.299). Since cells expressing activated, but not unactivated \u03b1IIb\u03b23 were able to adhere to D98, our data are consistent with a model in which the initial interaction between \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and fibrinogen is mediated by \u03b312 binding to the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 ligand binding site followed by a conformational change that exposes additional site(s) on \u03b1IIb\u03b23 for another region or regions of fibrinogen.
