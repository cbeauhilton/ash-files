    "abstract_text": "Background: Although first-line chemo-immunotherapy cures a significant number of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients, long term survival is only observed in 30% or 41% of patients treated with second-line therapy followed with high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell support (HDC-ASCS) or chimeric antigen receptor anti-CD19 T-cell therapy (CART-19) respectively. The use of third-line therapy with chemotherapy drugs or current available small molecule inhibitors for relapsed/refractory (rel/ref) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is associated with a poor response rate and a median survival of 6.3 months, stressing the need to identify druggable biomarkers associated with therapy resistance and poor clinical outcomes. Methods: To this end, we identified patients with rel/ref DLBCL that failed at least 2 prior lines of therapy treated at our Institute. Demographic, clinical and pathological characteristics were identified. Archived pathological material from the biopsy performed at the second relapse/progression was obtained for each patient. Using the Nanostring nCounter Analysis System (Nanostring Technologies, Seattle, WA), gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed for each sample as previously described using a custom designed code set containing 770 genes. Analysis and normalization of the raw Nanostring data was performed using nSolver Analysis Software v1.1. Raw counts were normalized to internal levels of 7 reference genes: CNOT2, GAPDH, HPRT1, PHGDH, SUMO2, SYS1 and WDR45L. A background count level was estimated using the average count of the 8 negative control probes in every reaction plus 2 standard deviations. Correlation between clinical outcomes (response rate to third line therapy, progression free-survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]) and IPI score, clinical characteristics and GEP. Subsequently and based on the GEP results, we evaluated the expression of Bcl-XL and other Bcl-2 family proteins in a panel of DLBCL cell lines. Immuno-precipitation (IP) studies were conducted to determine protein-protein interaction between Bcl-XL and other Bcl-2 related proteins. In addition, cell lines were exposed to A1331852, a novel Bcl-XL inhibitor at different doses alone or in combination with chemotherapy drugs. Cell viability was evaluated using Presto Blue assay and IC 50 values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism6 software. Results: A total of 53 rel/ref DLBCL were identified that received third line therapy at our Institute. The median age was 59yrs. The median PFS and OS was 23 months and 21 months respectively. Over-expression of BCL-XL RNA levels was associated with a shorter OS (P=0.015, HR=1.17). Pre-clinically higher levels of Bcl-XL as determined by western blotting were found in lymphoma cell lines resistant to chemotherapy agents in vitro . IP studies demonstrated a strong interaction between Bcl-XL and BIM in chemotherapy resistant cell lines. In vitro exposure of DLBCL cell lines to A1331852 resulted in dose- and time-dependent cell death. Moreover, synergistic activity was observed when A1331852 was combined with chemotherapy drugs (doxorubicin, vincristine and etoposide). Conclusion: Our data suggests that high expression level of BCLxL was associated with inferior prognosis in the refractory and/or relapsed DLBCL patients. Inhibition of Bcl-XL results in cell death of rituximab-chemotherapy resistant lymphoma cell lines and potentiates the anti-tumor activity of chemotherapy agents. Selective targeting of Bcl-XL may be a novel therapeutic strategy for rel/ref aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
