    "abstract_text": "Background. Chronic active BCR or TCR signaling or its oncogenic mimics result in nuclear accumulation of NF-kB. Oncogenic mimicry of BCR- and TCR signaling can be induced by viral oncoproteins (e.g. LMP2A (EBV), K1 (KSHV) and Tax (HTLV1), activating mutations in the CD79A , CD79B and CD3Z signaling chains or genetic lesions driving tyrosine kinase (e.g. BCR-ABL1 ), ERK ( RAS , BRAF , PLCG1 ) or PI3K ( PIK3CA , PIK3R1 ) signaling. While BCR and TCR signaling induces positive selection, survival and proliferation in normal lymphocytes, the majority of B cell and T cell malignancies are driven by oncogenic activation of this pathway. Concept & central hypothesis. Oncogenic drivers in B- and T-lymphoid malignancies function as mimics of B- and T-cell receptor (BCR or TCR) signaling. Oncogenic activation of BCR- or TCR-signaling represents the functional equivalent of positive selection during normal lymphocyte development. Addiction to survival and proliferation signals (or the equivalent of positive selection ) is a common feature in many types of cancer. However, B- and T-lymphoid malignancies are unique in that they are also subject to an active negative selection process. B- and T-cells expressing autoreactive antibodies and TCRs, respectively, can cause systemic autoimmunity. As a safeguard against autoimmune diseases, lymphocyte development evolved autoimmunity checkpoints (AIC) to eliminate autoreactive clones . Owing to negative selection of autoreactive B- and T-cells through AIC activation, lymphoid cells fundamentally differ in their signaling requirements from other cell types. Four recent studies from our group showed that despite malignant transformation, B cell- and T cell-lineage leukemia and lymphoma cells are fully sensitive to negative selection and AIC-activation resulting (Chen et al., Nature 2015; Shojaee et al., Cancer Cell 2015; Shojaee et al., Nature Med 2016; Chan et al., Nature 2017). Results: AIC-activation in various lymphoid malignancies is achievable by pharmacological hyperactivation of BCR- and TCR-signaling above a maximum threshold, e.g. pharmacological inhibition of PTEN, SHIP1 or DUSP6 phosphatases ( Figure ). Studying genetic models of B cell malignancies, we observed that Cre-mediated deletion of Pten , Ship1 and constitutive deletion of Dusp6 caused hyperactivation of SYK, PI3K and ERK-pathways, leading to AIC-activation. Unlike other types of cancer, B- and T-cell malignancies are uniquely susceptible to clonal deletion induced by hyperactive signaling from an autoreactive BCR or TCR. Hence, targeted AIC-activation can be leveraged for eradication of drug-resistant leukemia and lymphoma clones. Studying engineered B cells for inducible activation of autoreactive BCR-signaling, we discovered that targeted hyperactivation of SYK, PI3K and ERK in B cell malignancies represents the functional equivalent of an autoimmunity checkpoint (AIC) for elimination of autoreactive clones. Likewise, transformed B cell tumors are uniquely vulnerable to AIC activation, suggesting that targeted activation of this checkpoint represents a novel strategy to induce cell death in otherwise drug-resistant B cell malignancies. Conclusion: Normal B- and T-cells are positively selected for BCR or TCR signaling of intermediate strength (moderate activation of SYK, PI3K and ERK). In the absence of a functional BCR/TCR, SYK, PI3K and ERK activity fall below a minimum threshold, resulting in death by neglect. Hyperactivation above maximum thresholds (e.g. autoreactive BCR/TCR) triggers negative selection and cell death via AIC-activation. Targeted therapy of cancer typically focuses onagents that suppress oncogenic signaling below a minimum threshold . Our results support a novel strategy to overcome drug-resistance in B- and T-cell malignancies based on targeted activation of autoimmunity checkpoints (AIC) for removal of autoreactive cells.
