    "abstract_text": "Objective: Malignant lymphoma (ML), Kikuchi-Fuljimoto disease (KFD) and L-forms Acid-fast bacillus infection (L-forms TB) usually affect the cervical lymph nodes. KFD and L-form TB are often confused with ML and take misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. The diagnosed of these diseases is on basis of an excision biopsy of affected lymph nodes. Methods: We analyzed 63 patients (including case diagnosed in our hospital) by clinical characteristic, laboratory, pathological morphology, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. Results: Of 63 cases, 43 were ML, 17 were KFD and 3 were L-forms TB. In ML disease, 46% were male and 54% were female, mean age was 54 (11\u201382). 9% cases have persistent fever and associated with hepatosplenomegaly. In KFD, 47% were male and 53% were female, mean age was 26 (17\u201345). 59% cases with cervical hymphadenopath and no fever, 41% had painful, accompanied by fever. hepathosplenomegaly, occasionally leucopenia and lypadenopathy especially involving cervical region not responsive to antibiotic treatment. 29% lymph tissues were morphologically, and characterized by a necrosis in the cortical or paracortical areas of enlarged lymph node around the necrotic area. T lymphocytes were found and absence of granulocytes. 30% cases were mistaken to ML. L-forms TB disease, there were fever, clinical and histological were similar KFD and ML. 3 cases were misdiagnosis to ML or KFD. Laboratory analyses: PAM and PAS were positive, and anti acid test to found L-forms bacterium in tissues. Conclusions: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease and L-forms Acid-Fast bacillus infection are easily confused histological and clinically with malignant lymphoma. Clinicians and pathologists must be aware of this condition. Although Malignant lymphoma, Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease and L-forms Acid-fast bacillus infection can be found any age, but should be considered for malignant lymphoma in older patients. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is predominantly a self-limiting disease of the young and most cases with fever, nodal biopsy showing fragmentation necrosis and karyorrhexis, not responsive to antibiotic treatment. In the L-forms Acid-fast bacillus infection, the PAM and PAS are positive, and have an effective antibiotic treatment."
