    "abstract_text": "Childhood malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum (pf) is often characterized by severe anemia at low parasite burdens; the mechanism(s) responsible for this pathology remain to be defined. We have reported that erythrocyte (E) CR1, the immune adherence receptor specific for C3b, is reduced during anemia in childhood malaria, suggesting a possible role for complement in E destruction. Intravascular lysis of infected E by pf leads to release of E breakdown products hemoglobin and hematin, which have inflammatory properties. Free hematin can bind to E, and we find that in serum and in whole blood anti-coagulated with lepirudin, moderate concentrations of hematin activate the alternative pathway of complement and promote deposition of C3 activation and breakdown products on E. We documented C3 deposition by flow cytometry, and additional fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that most of the deposited C3 fragments are located in close juxtaposition to CR1. Western blots confirmed that the C3 fragments are indeed covalently bound to the E, and immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that a fraction of the deposited C3 is covalently bound to CR1. The degree of C3 fragment deposition is directly correlated with E CR1 levels, both within a given donor\u2019s E population and when E from different donors are compared. E opsonized with complement in the presence of hematin form rosettes with Raji cells, through interaction with CR2, the C3dg receptor expressed on several types of B cells including splenic marginal zone B cells. Thus, hematin-mediated complement activation and C3 fragment deposition on E may promote accelerated splenic (or liver) clearance of the youngest E, which have the most CR1, leading to sudden onset of anemia along with reduction of mean CR1 on surviving E. A monoclonal antibody specific for C3b, mAb 3E7, previously demonstrated to inhibit the alternative pathway of complement, completely blocks the C3 fragment deposition reaction. Use of this monoclonal antibody in non-human primate models of malaria may provide insight into mechanisms of erythrocyte destruction and thus aid in the development of therapies based on inhibiting the alternative pathway of complement.",
