    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B-cell malignancy characterized by an abnormal proliferation and infiltration of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent a crucial component of the BM niche and mediate essential signalling via cytokines and cell-cell interactions. The interplay of MM cells and BM-MSC is complex and relies on multiple signaling pathways leading to MM progression and therapeutic resistance. Objectives : MM remains an incurable disease so far. Distinctive for this disease is a long-lasting polarization of the BM niche influencing MM progression and prognosis. We, therefore, focussed on MSCs to identify enrichment for different hallmark gene sets and their aberrant signaling contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease, therapy response and to further identify novel therapeutic strategies. Methods : BM-MSCs were isolated from patients with MM at diagnosis (MM-D-MSC) and in remission (MM-R-MSC) as well as from donors with other malignant diseases (CTR-MSC). RNA sequencing and Western Blot were used for examination of enriched pathways. Various functional assays for proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle were performed either using a mono-culture or co-culture protocol of MSC and the MM-cell lines MM.1S and SKMM2 treating the cells with the pan-PI3K-inhibitor GDC-0941. Results : MM-D-MSCs supported the growth of myeloma cell lines better (3 fold, p<0.01) than MM-R- and CTR-MSCs. Our results demonstrate that MM-D-MSCs have a distinct gene expression profile compared to CTR-MSC indicating potential nodes of crosstalk and therapeutic importance. Amongst others, the PI3K-AKT-mTOR hallmark gene set was significantly enriched in MM-D-MSCs as compared to CTR-MSCs (p<0.001). We confirmed these findings on a proteomic level. We found evidence for the upregulation of PI3K\u03b1, AKT, pAKT and mTOR in MM-D-MSC comparing to the other MM-R- and CTR-MSCs (p<0.05). We treated these MSC and the MM-cell lines MM.1S and SKMM2 with the PI3-Kinase inhibitor GDC-0941. The treatment reduced the signaling PI3K\u03b1, AKT and mTOR in both, MSC and MM-cells. As stated MM-D-MSC supported the growth of myeloma cells better than other MSC types. However, upon GDC-0941 treatment, the proliferation of MM-D-MSCs was significantly reduced compared to the other MSC-types. In addition, the inhibition of proliferation of myeloma cell lines MM1S and SKMM2 was much more pronounced when they were cocultured with MM-D-MSC (32 and 34 %, p=0.04) compared to the growth of myeloma cells in coculture with MSC types, either in remission or other malignancies. Conclusion : We here identified functionally distinct differences in MM-D-MSCs compared to MM-R-MSCs or CTR-MSCs. Our data further provides a deeper insight into the molecular signature of MM-MSCs, a predictive of patient prognosis and treatment outcome. Targeting MSCs as a crucial part of the MM-BM niche by using PI3K-inhibitors could contribute to novel therapeutic strategies to effectively block MM-MSC interaction improving overall patient survival.
