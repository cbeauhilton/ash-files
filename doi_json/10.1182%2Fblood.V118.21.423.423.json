    "abstract_text": "Abstract 423 BACKGROUND: Relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by poor prognosis, with low complete remission (CR) rates after salvage therapy and low overall survival. A major challenge is to improve the CR rate, thereby increasing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) rates. Panobinostat is a pan-deacetylase inhibitor that increases acetylation of proteins involved in cancer. Preclinical studies in AML demonstrated that panobinostat potentiates the activity of cytarabine (ara-C) and fludarabine and has synergistic activity in combination with doxorubicin in vitro. Single-agent panobinostat has induced CR in patients (pts) with AML. The addition of panobinostat to an active chemotherapeutic regimen in pts with relapsed/refractory AML has the potential to improve therapeutic outcomes in this setting. AIMS: This phase Ib, multicenter, open-label dose-escalation study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of panobinostat in combination with a fixed dose of ara-C and mitoxantrone in pts with relapsed/refractory AML. The secondary objectives were to characterize safety and tolerability during the dose-escalation phase and at the MTD and to evaluate anti-leukemic activity. METHODS: Successive cohorts of at least 3 pts with confirmed relapsed or refractory AML were treated with oral panobinostat (starting with 20 mg, escalated in 10-mg steps) thrice weekly on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12, in combination with intravenous ara-C (1 g/m 2 ) on days 1\u20136 and mitoxantrone (5 mg/m 2 ) on days 1\u20135 of a 28-day cycle. The MTD was determined on the basis of the observed dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), safety assessment, and tolerability during the first 28 days after starting panobinostat. A DLT was defined as any adverse event (AE) or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications with the following criteria: neutropenia lasting > 28 days after cycle 1 for hematologic DLTs; grade 4 AST/ALT or grade 3 AST/ALT for > 7 days; grade 3/4 bilirubin, vomiting, diarrhea, or any non-hematologic toxicity for non-hematologic DLTs. Safety and tolerability were described as type, duration, frequency, relatedness, and severity of AEs according to CTCAE v3.0. The adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model was used to guide dose escalation with overdose control. RESULTS: Of 5 dose levels, 40 pts (median age, 55 years; range, 19\u201373 years) were treated at panobinostat dosages of 20 to 60 mg, with 5 pts at 20 mg, 8 at 30 mg, 10 at 40 mg, 11 at 50 mg, and 6 at 60 mg. Of 6 DLTs observed, 1 was at 40 mg (sepsis and tachyarrhythmia), 2 were at 50 mg (vomiting/nausea; diarrhea), and 3 were at 60 mg (neutropenic colitis; 2 hypokalemic events). Frequent AEs of all grades, regardless of causality, included nausea (32 [80%]), diarrhea (31 [78%]), vomiting (26 [65%]), hypokalemia (25 [63%]), thrombocytopenia (24 [60%]), abdominal pain (22 [55%]), decreased appetite, and febrile neutropenia (21 each [53%]). The most frequent grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs were thrombocytopenia (20 [50%]), anemia (9 [23%]), leukopenia, and neutropenia (7 each [18%]). Serious AEs, regardless of causality, were reported in 23 pts, with febrile neutropenia (12 [30%]) being the most common. The MTD was determined to be 50 mg of panobinostat on the basis of observed DLTs and safety and tolerability in cycle 1 of the dose-escalation phase. Clinical responses were observed in 22 pts (55%), including 13 CR, 5 morphological CR, and 4 partial remissions. In pts receiving 40- and 50-mg doses of panobinostat, the preliminary efficacy was promising, with a response in 11 of 21 pts (52%). An alloHSCT was performed in 8 pts after the start of salvage therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of panobinostat, ara-C, and mitoxantrone showed no unexpected toxicities and promising anti-leukemic activity in pts with relapsed/refractory AML. The MTD was determined to be 50 mg of panobinostat; enrollment at this dose is ongoing for the dose-expansion phase to further assess safety, tolerability, and activity. Thrombocytopenia and anemia were the principal treatment-related hematologic AEs. Treatment-related non-hematologic AEs were primarily gastrointestinal toxicities and fatigue.
