    "abstract_text": "Abstract 586 Background: Dacetuzumab (SGN-40), a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD40, mediates antitumor activity through multiple mechanisms of action, including effector cell functions (ADCC/ADCP) and direct apoptotic signal transduction. Ongoing evaluation of the molecule has led to 2 additional key findings: a gene signature that predicts sensitivity to single-agent dacetuzumab, and upregulation of the pro-apoptotic and chemosensitizing transcription factor TAp63\u03b1a when dacetuzumab is combined with rituximab (R) and gemcitabine (GEM). In prior single-agent dacetuzumab trials, several patients who were immediately treated with GEM after progressing achieved unexpected responses. These observations provided rationale for further analysis of the combination of dacetuzumab, R and GEM. Methods: A phase 1b dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and adverse event profile of dacetuzumab, R and GEM was conducted in patients with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Patients received dacetuzumab at cohort-specific doses of 8 or 12 mg/kg IV weekly in combination with R (375 mg/m 2 IV for 1 cycle, then once/28-day cycle) and GEM (1000 mg/m 2 IV weekly or biweekly) in a 3 + 3 dose-escalation scheme. A maximum number of 8 cycles was permitted. Eligible patients included those with de novo DLBCL, including transformed lymphoma and follicular grade 3, who failed potentially curative therapy. Results: Thirty-one patients with a median age of 68 years (range 29\u201380) were enrolled and treated in the study (3 patients in each of 3 cohorts + 22 in an expansion cohort). The median number of prior regimens was 3 (range 1\u201318); 10 patients (32%) had transformed histology and 4 (13%) had prior ASCT. The median number of cycles received was 3 (range 1\u20138), although 11 patients are still on treatment. Three patients in the first cohort required dose reduction of GEM due to transient, non-dose-limiting thrombocytopenia. The protocol was thus amended to administer GEM on a biweekly schedule. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed, and MTD was not defined. Based on pharmacokinetic modeling suggesting no significant difference in exposure between dose levels, 8 mg/kg of dacetuzumab was chosen as the dose for the expansion cohort. The combination of dacetuzumab, R and GEM was generally well tolerated. Across all cohorts, the most common adverse events (> 15%) were nausea (42%), thrombocytopenia (35%), fatigue (32%), headache (29%), anorexia (19%), dyspnea (19%), pyrexia (19%), diarrhea (16%), and neutropenia (16%), the majority of which were Grade 1 or 2. Grade 3/4 adverse events related to dacetuzumab occurred infrequently. One patient experienced Grade 3 stress cardiomyopathy that resolved; this patient had a history of congestive heart failure. One patient developed pneumonitis in the left lung and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and subsequently died due to pulmonary toxicity; this patient had received prior radiation therapy to the left chest. There was preliminary evidence of antitumor activity. Of the 28 patients with response assessments, 7 patients achieved CR, 8 PR, 7 SD, and 6 PD per investigator assessment of response, yielding an objective response rate of 54%. Of interest, 1 patient who previously failed ASCT achieved a CR and was able to undergo allogeneic transplant. To date, this patient remains in CR. Conclusion: The combination of dacetuzumab, R and biweekly GEM was generally well tolerated. Evidence of antitumor activity with this combination is encouraging as multiple responses were observed in a population with heavily pre-treated patients. Further investigation with a randomized trial is warranted to more fully characterize safety and efficacy and to determine if sensitivity to this combination correlates with the previously identified single-agent predictive gene signature.
