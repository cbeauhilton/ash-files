    "abstract_text": "The ineffective hematopoiesis that is characteristic of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) suggests functional defects of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) transgenic mice recapitulate many features of human MDS such as ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral blood cytopenias, dysplasia, and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and have been used as a pre-clinical model for human MDS. NHD13 mice universally develop signs of MDS (e.g., peripheral blood cytopenia, macrocytosis, dysplasia) at approximately 5 months of age, with median survival of 10 months. Two month old NHD13 mice do not show clear evidence of MDS such as peripheral blood cytopenia, dysplasia, or transformation to AML. Bone marrow nucleated cells (BMNC) from two month old NHD13 mice have a modest 1.3-fold increase of lineage negative (LN) BMNCs compared to age matched WT mice. The increased number of LN BMNCs appeared to be primarily due to a 3.4-fold increase of the LN Sca-1+cKit-(LS + K \u02c9) cells, an early lymphoid-committed precursor. Lineage negative Sca-1+ c-Kit+ (LSK) cells, which include the most immature, undifferentiated cells, can be divided into five sub populations, based on expression of Flk2, CD150, and CD48. These populations have been designated Long-Term Hematopoietic Stem Cell (LT-HSC), Short-Term HSC, (ST-HSC), and Multi-Potent Progenitor 2, 3, and 4 (MPP2, MPP3, and MPP4) based on functional assays. Two-month old NHD13 mice had decreased MPP4 (5-fold), decreased LT-HSC (3.6-fold) and increased ST-HSC (2.3-fold) compared with the age matched WT mice. The expansion of ST-HSC two-month old NHD13 mice was associated with increased cell proliferation of ST- HSC, as assessed by bromo-deoxy-uridine (BRDU) incorporation. We next studied LSK subsets from NHD13 mice aged seven months, which coincided with peripheral blood findings consistent with MDS (e.g. anemia, thrombocytopenia, macrocytosis), BM from seven month old NHD13 mice showed significant reductions of all LSK population subsets. LT-HSCs show differential expression of the CD41 antigen, and CD41 \u02c9 LT-HSCs are more quiescent than CD41+ LT-HSCs and are thought to reside at the apex of the hematopoietic differentiation hierarchy. Although there was no difference in the absolute number of quiescent CD41 \u02c9 LT-HSC between two and six month old WT mice, six month old NHD13 mice show a marked decrease (4.2 fold) in CD41 \u02c9 LT-HSCs, suggesting exhaustion of LT-HSC in NHD13 mice. Colony forming assays were used to assess function of the five LSK sub-populations in vitro. LT-HSC and ST- HSC from NHD13 BMNC did not produce any colonies in two independent experiments, whereas MPP2 and MPP3 from NHD13 BMNC produced a similar number and lineage distribution of colonies compared to WT BMNC. This result suggested that HSCs from NHD13 BMNC may be functionally impaired, and that NHD13 hematopoietic progenitor cells may instead be derived primarily from MPP2 and MPP3. To evaluate HSC self-renewal activity, the five LSK subsets from NHD13 BMNC were transplanted to lethally irradiated mice together with 5 x 10 5 WT BMNC competitor cells. None of the NHD13 LSK sub-populations showed evidence of engraftment. Since NHD13 LN BMNC have previously been shown to be more prone to apoptosis than their WT counterpart, it is possible that lack of engraftment of NHD13 LSK subsets was due to the ex vivo sorting procedure. However, we also considered the possibility that NHD13 lineage positive (LP) BMNC had acquired self-renewal potential, and were contributing to long term hematopoiesis in the NHD13 BM. Therefore, we transplanted LP and LN BMNC from NHD13 or WT mice into WT recipients, again with WT competitor BMNC. Almost half of the NHD13 LP recipients showed long-term (>26 weeks) myeloid engraftment, whereas none of the WT LP recipients showed long term myeloid engraftment. Taken together, these findings suggest that the primitive LT-HSC (LSK Flk2 \u02c9 CD150+CD48 \u02c9 CD41 \u02c9 ) from NHD13 BM become exhausted with age, corresponding to the presentation of findings consistent with MDS (peripheral blood cytopenia, macrocytosis). Furthermore, self-renewal activity of NHD13 LP BMNCs suggest the existence of a compensatory mechanism for the homeostasis of hematopoiesis in MDS.
