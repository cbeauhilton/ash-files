    "abstract_text": "Background . Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) that develops in the course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a rare event. Optimal management of these patients (pts) is not defined. We analyzed outcome of 10 pts treated for Hodgkin\u00b4s variant (HV) of Richter syndrome. Patients and methods. Overall 10 pts (8 males) with CLL and subsequent HV were treated between 1996 and 2015. Median age at diagnosis of HV was 68 (range 54 - 83) years. Prognostic markers of CLL at diagnosis: unmutated IGHV (5 pts), del(17p) or TP53 mutations (0 pt), del(11q) (2 pts), deletion of 13q14 region (4 pts), trisomy 12 (2 pts), ZAP 70 pos. (6 pts), CD38 pos.(4pts). The diagnosis of HV included various subtypes of HL: nodular sclerosis (3pts), mixed cellularity (3pts), lymphocyte rich (1pt), not othervise specified (3pts). EBV status of pts at diagnosis of HV of Richter syndrome: 6 pos., 1 negat. nad 3 not done. Initial and second-line treatments of CLL consisted of fludarabine- based regimens combined with rituximab or alemtuzumab and 3 pts received chlorambucil. Treatment of HV of Richter syndrome included: ABVD (7 pts) in combination with rituximab (2 pts), COPP (3 pts) and involved field radiotherapy of 30 Gy after chemotherapy (2 pts). Further treatment was required in 6 pts due to insufficient response with persistent CLL: rituximab alone (2 pts), R-bendamustine (1pt), R-DHAP (1 pt), cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (1 pt) and gemcitabine (1 pt). None of these patients underwent autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Results. The median time from CLL diagnosis to development of HV was 8.4 (range 2.6 - 16.5) years. Median overall survival from diagosis of CLL was 17.3 years and median survival after diagnosis of HV was 3.5 years. Out of 10 pts 5 are alive :3 in complete remission (CR), 1in partial remission of CLL (HL in CR), 2 in progression of CLL (HL in CR). Five pts died (3 lymphoma progressions, 1 second cancer, 1 unknown causality). Conclusion. Our results indicate a long period for developing of HV of Richter syndrome and its subsequent poor outcome. Current HL based chemotherapy is not sufficient in HV of Richter syndrome and new treatment approaches should be considered. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
