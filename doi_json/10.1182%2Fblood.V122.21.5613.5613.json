    "abstract_text": "Introduction Progress has been made in diagnosis and treatment of patients with CLL who receive their treatment within prospective clinical trials. Due to necessary inclusion and exclusion criteria only a very limited number of patients are treated in studies. Therefore results from clinical trials can't be transferred into routine care. No clinical practice data are available how patients with CLL are diagnosed and treated in routine care and whether improvements in survival are achieved. Methods A retrospective analysis of all patients with CLL who were treated in an oncology group practice in Germany between 1995-2012. Relevant clinical data concerning diagnosis, treatment and survival were transferred from clinical files into a database and analyzed statistically using SPSS and SURVSOFT. Results 580 CLL patients with a median age of 67 (35-92) were identified. At initial diagnosis 446 patients (76.9 %) were in Binet stage A, 69 (11.9%) Binet stage B and 31 (5.3%) Binet stage C. Due to external diagnosis of 34 patients (5.9%) the stage at initial diagnosis couldn't be retrieved. 323 patients (55.7 %) never received any treatment. 257 patients (44.3%) needed therapy with a median of 2 therapy lines (1-11). Regimens most frequently applied were: Bendamustine-containig (66.9%), Rituximab-containing (62.3%), Chlorambucil-containing (61.5%), Bendamustine+Rituximab-combinations (48.2%) and Fludarabine-containing (40.9%). 21.0% of patients were treated within a clinical trial. 5 and 10 year absolute overall survival was 83.6% and 60.9%. Relative survival after 5 and 10 years was 96.1% and 82.3%. Median overall survival according to Binet stage was 16 years for Binet A, 9 years for Binet B and 8 years for Binet C. Median relative survival was 20.8 years for Binet A, 14.0 years for Binet B and 8.6 years for Binet C. Patients who needed therapy had a median overall survival of 11 years (0-41) compared to 18 years (0-23+) of patients who never needed any therapy. Conclusions 55.7% of CLL-patients never needed any therapy. Patients who needed therapy had a much lower life expectancy compared to patients who never needed therapy. Treatment consisted mainly of Bendamustine, Rituximab, Chlorambucil, Bendamustine+Rituximab-combinations and Fludarabine leading to a marked prolongation of survival compared to historical controls and registry data.
