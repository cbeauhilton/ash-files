    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common monogenic disorder, afflicting millions worldwide, and causing hemolytic anemia and chronic organ damage from vaso-occlusion. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is an endogenous type of hemoglobin present in all humans during development, which is normally suppressed in infancy. Biochemical and clinical studies have shown that increased synthesis of HbF inhibits sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization and reduces clinical severity. Concerted efforts have been made to induce the synthesis of HbF in adult erythroid cells with chemical inducers of HbF and through disruption of transcription factors in repressor complexes. As wide variability in individual responses to drug candidates have been observed in clinical trials, consistently effective HbF inducers are highly desired. We previously identified that Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) is involved in the regulation of the fetal \u03b3-globin genes, and inhibition of LSD1 using either RNAi or by the momoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine (TC) in primary human erythroid progenitor cells induces HbF to therapeutic levels. However, TC treatment has potentially problematic side effects, and at high concentrations decreases adult b-globin mRNAs and impairs erythroid maturation. We have now investigated another LSD1 inhibitor, RN-1, which is a cell-permeable TC analog that acts as a potent, irreversible inhibitor of LSD1 with a lower IC 50 than TC. We investigated in vivo effects of RN-1 on \u03b3-globin gene expression and erythroid physiology in a transgenic mouse model of SCD which expresses human \u03b1- and sickle \u03b2-globin, and has many genetic, hematologic, and pathophysiological features found in SCD patients, including irreversibly sickled RBCs, hemolytic anemia, high reticulocyte counts, hepatosplenomegaly and organ pathology. We found a robust increase in human fetal \u03b3-globin (15-fold) and murine embryonic \u03b5Y- and \u03b2H1-globin mRNAs (36 and 54-fold) and 4-fold increases in human HbF in SCD mice following repeated RN-1 treatment (at 10 \u03bcg/g body weight) within 4 weeks. Further, irreversibly sickled RBCs were significantly reduced, and RBC lifespan increased markedly in RN-1-treated SCD mice, leading to significantly decrease pathophysiologic indicators (hemolysis, splenomegaly, and organ necrosis) compared to untreated SCD mice. To begin to evaluate potential effects of RN-1 on erythroid progenitor cells from patients with SCD, peripheral blood from 5 adult SCD patients was cultured with RN-1 (0.07 to 0.25 \u03bcM) in a 2-phase progenitor assay, with mRNA analyzed on day 12 and F-reticulocytes on day 13-14 of the erythroid differentiation phase. RN-1 treated progenitors demonstrated a mean 3.4-fold higher g-globin mRNA (p=0.04) and 5% higher absolute F-reticulocytes than were observed in untreated progenitors from the same subject, with responses occurring in 5/5 subjects' assays. These preclinical studies provide additional evidence that modulating LSD-1 activity is a promising approach to inducing HbF expression as a mechanism to reduce clinical severity of SCD.
