    "abstract_text": "Despite much investigation into T regulatory cells (Tregs), little is known about the mechanism controlling their recruitment and function. Since mesenchymal cells (MSCs) exert an immune regulatory function and suppress T cell proliferation, this in vitro study investigated their role in Treg recruitment and function. hMSCs and different T cell populations (CD3 + , CD3 + /CD45RA + , CD3 + /CD45RO + , CD4 + /CD25 + , CD4 + /CD25 + /CD45RO + , CD4 + /CD25 + /CD45RA + ) from healthy donors were co-cultured for up to 15 days. Harvested lymphocytes were analysed by flow-cytometry; FoxP3 and CD127 expression were measured by real time PCR; regulatory activity was assessed. Within CD3+ fraction, percentages of CD4+/CD25 bright and CD4+/CD25 bright /Foxp3+ cells were higher in the presence of hMSCs (42% vs 34% for the CD4+/CD25 bright and 20.5 vs 3.5 for the CD4+/CD25 bright /Foxp3+). Within CD3+/CD45RA+ and CD3+/CD45RO+ fractions, the T reg starting fraction of the nai\u0308ve population rose from 0.05% \u00b1 0.01 CD4/CD25 positive cells to 0.2% \u00b1 0.14 and the T reg starting fraction of the memory population rose from 0.3% \u00b1 0.05 CD4/CD25 positive cells to 1.5% \u00b1 0.9. Within CD4 + /CD25 + , CD4 + /CD25 + /CD45RA + , CD4 + /CD25 + /CD45RO + , FoxP3 expression did not change in CD4+/CD25+ cells. It increased 5.38\u00b12.3 fold in CD4+/CD25+/CD45RA+ and 7.98\u00b11.9 fold in CD4+/CD25+/CD45RO+ cells. CD127 expression decreased by -582\u00b129.2 fold in CD4+/CD25+ cells, by -216\u00b117.5 fold in CD4+/CD25+/CD45RA+ and by -71.95\u00b112.6 fold in CD4+/CD25+/CD45RO+ cells. Cytofluorimetric analysis showed CD4+/CD25+/FoxP3+ was up-regulated to 14%\u00b14 and CD127 down-regulated to 4.4%\u00b11.5 vs respectively 0.2%\u00b10.28 and 21.9%\u00b13.5 in controls without MSCs (CD4+/CD25+ alone). FoxP3 up-regulation was more marked in CD4+/CD25 bright cells (51%\u00b110 vs 0.1%\u00b10.7 in controls). Sorted Tregs exert potent immunosuppressive activity on CD4+/CD25- cell populations. Inhibitory activity was lost within 15 days when sorted T regs were cultured without hMSC. On day +15 proliferation using CD4+/CD25+ cells as suppressor cells was 1.7\u00b10.8 vs 45.2\u00b112 in controls; proliferation using CD4/CD25+/CD45RA+ as suppressor cells was 5.4\u00b13.1, vs 21.3\u00b111.2 in controls, and proliferation with CD4+/CD25+/RO+ as suppressor cells was 2.3\u00b12 vs 33.5\u00b18.7 in controls. We demonstrate MSC recruit Tregs from a fraction of CD3+ and from immunoselected CD3+/CD45RA+ and CD3+/CD45RO+ fractions. After culture with MSCs both immunoselected fractions registered increases in the CD4+/CD25 bright /FoxP3 subset and CD127 expression was down regulated. When purified Treg populations (CD4/CD25+, CD4/CD25+/CD45RA+ and CD4/CD25+/CD45RO+) were used as fraction for hMSC co-cultures, they maintain FoxP3 expression and CD127 expression is down-regulated. Treg suppressive capacity was maintained in Treg populations that were layered on MSC for up to 15 days while control Tregs lost all suppressive activity after 5 days culture. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that MSCs recruit, regulate and maintain T regulatory phenotype and function over time."
