    "abstract_text": "Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines provide not only an unique system for studying human embryonic development, but also have enormous potential as a source of therapeutic tissues, including those of vascular and hematopoietic lineages. However, it is difficult to generate large-scale of relatively pure population of specific lineage cells derived from hESCs. Here, we describe a 2-dimensional (2-D) culture system for hESC differentiation to generate hematopoietic and endothelial cells in vitro without embryoid body (EB) formation (3-D). To initial differentiation, hESCs (H1 and H9 cell lines) were placed in serum-containing media for 9\u201310 days without supplement of additional growth factors. Gene expression analysis of 2-D differentiation indicated that Oct-4, a pluripotent gene, was decreased, while genes for GATA-2 and CD31, were increased, suggesting that differentiated hESCs contain hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors. Comparing with 3-D EB formation, 2-D differentiation was able to generate robust differentiated cells (5 to 10-fold higher). To generate a reasonable pure population of hematopoietic and endothelial precursors, CD34+ cells prior to hematopoietic commitment were isolated from 2-D differentiation by immuno-magnetic beads and cultured in the presence of hematopoietic growth factors and endothelial growth factors. After 7\u201310 days culture of CD34+ cells, both suspension and adherent cells emerged. The number of suspension and adherent cells was dependent on the presence of hematopoietic growth factors or/and endothelial growth factors. The suspension cells expressed hematopoietic marker, CD45, and gave rise to multi-lineage hematopoietic colonies on methylcellulose cultures. The adherent cells expressed endothelial markers, such as CD31 and Ve-cadherin, and took up Dill-labeled ac-LDL. The adherent cells rapidly formed capillary-like structures on Matrigel cultures, while the suspension cells would not. While the adherent cells were implanted into mice, they formed functional blood vessels in vivo . Our culture system paves the road for further large-scale manufacture of hematopoietic and endothelial cells derived from human ES cells. Our studies demonstrated also that CD34+ cells derived from human ES cells contain hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors.",
