    "abstract_text": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with profound defects in immune function, resulting in failure of anti-tumor immunity and increased susceptibility to infection. We have previously demonstrated alterations in gene expression profiles of T cells from CLL patients, which translate into functional defects in T-cell immune synapse formation, motility and cytotoxicity (Gorgun et al. JCI 2005; Ramsay et al. JCI 2008, Blood 2013). However a comparison of the transcriptome of natural killer (NK) cells from CLL patients and controls has not been investigated. NK cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with CLL and healthy donors, followed by gene expression profiling using the Affymetrix U133Plus2.0 platform. 117 probes showed a >2-fold decrease in expression while only 18 probes showed a >2-fold increase in expression (adjusted p-value < 0.05) in CLL NK cells compared to healthy donor NK cells. Strikingly, 52 out of the 117 significantly down-regulated probes (44.4%) were for interferon-inducible genes including STAT1 (Signal Transducers and Activator 1), SOCS1 (Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1), interferon regulatory factor genes IRF7 and IRF9 , and oligoadenylate synthetase genes OAS1 , OAS2 , and OAS3. The majority of these genes were inducible by both type 1 and type 2 interferons. Many of these genes have been implicated in host immunity to viral infections, and so it is possible that decreased NK-cell responsiveness to interferon contributes to the increased susceptibility of CLL patients to viruses. Notably, there was also altered expression of signaling pathways in common with T cells from CLL patients, with dysregulation of the cytoskeleton genes RAB3GAP1 , RAB38 , and EPHA1 and down-regulation of JUN mirroring the dysregulated JNK-signaling and the altered actin cytoskeleton pathways we have found in T cells from CLL patients. These changes were not due to differences in the relative frequencies of CD56 DIM and CD56 BRIGHT NK cells. Lenalidomide has significant clinical activity in CLL. It is not directly toxic to tumor cells in vitro, but instead is thought to activate anti-tumor immunity and block pro-tumor micro-environmental factors. NK-cell proliferation has been shown to correlate with clinical response to lenalidomide in CLL (Chanan Khan et al. BJ Haem 2011). Therefore, we investigated the effect of lenalidomide treatment on the gene expression profiles of NK cells from CLL patients in comparison to healthy controls. PBMCs from CLL patients or healthy controls were cultured in the presence of 1\u03bcM lenalidomide or vehicle control for 48 hours, followed by NK-cell isolation, RNA extraction and gene expression profiling. There were striking differences in the effect of lenalidomide on NK cells from CLL patients compared with healthy NK cells. In CLL NK cells, lenalidomide repaired the down-regulation of interferon-inducible genes, by increasing the expression of genes such as OAS3 , IFIT1 , IFI44L , IFIT3 , OAS1 , PDK4 , and ACTN1 . Pathway analysis highlighted the effect of lenalidomide on inducing interferon signaling, showing significant activation of interferon \u03b1, \u03b3, and \u03bb as upstream regulators. While many of the interferon-inducible genes were up-regulated >3-fold in CLL NK cells, only OAS3 was significantly up-regulated in healthy NK cells with lenalidomide. Furthermore, the gene for IFN\u03b3, IFNG , was actually significantly down-regulated in healthy NK cells by this agent. Lenalidomide also significantly down-regulated the expression of 5 genes encoding killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs): KIR2DL1 , KIR2DL2 , KIR2DS3 , KIR2DS4 , and KIR3DL2 , in healthy NK cells, but did not significantly down-regulate KIR genes in the CLL NK-cell dataset. Lenalidomide treatment did have some overlapping effects on CLL and healthy NK cells, including up-regulation of genes ARL11, CYFIP, and CORO1B that regulate the actin cytoskeleton pathway. In conclusion, NK cells from CLL patients have down-regulation of interferon response genes and pathways known to regulate normal immune function in response to bacteria and viruses. Lenalidomide has a differential effect on CLL and healthy NK cells: in CLL NK cells it repairs defective interferon responses, whereas in healthy NK cells it down-regulates inhibitory pathways.
