    "abstract_text": "Recent clinical data illustrate the effectiveness of CD20xCD3 T cell engagers (TCEs) that redirect the patient's endogenous T cells to eliminate CD20-positive tumor cells. While several of these products have demonstrated promising clinical activities in B-cell malignancies, their potential therapeutic utility is limited by cytokine release syndrome (CRS), even after strategies such as step-up dosing are implemented. ADG152 is a novel CD20xCD3 TCE prodrug engineered using Adagene's SAFEbody technology to minimize or eliminate CRS and on-target/off-tumor toxicities. The anti-CD20 arm of ADG152 has been engineered for enhanced binding to CD20 compared to other clinical stage or approved antibodies, while its anti-CD3 arm has modulated affinity for CD3 and is also masked by a conditionally activable peptide. In normal tissues and in circulation, the masking moiety on the anti-CD3 arm can function to block the binding of ADG152 to T cells; however, in an activable condition such as the tumor microenvironment where protease activity has been reported to be elevated, the masked antibody can be activated, enabling the activated ADG152 to simultaneously engage T cells and neighboring CD20-expressing tumor cells. In vitro studies showed that ADG152 has enhanced binding to human B cells and CD20-positive Raji tumor cells compared with the benchmark CD20xCD3 TCE plamotamab. On the other hand, ADG152 has significantly reduced binding to the human CD3 \u03b4/\u03b5 protein dimer and no binding to human CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells isolated from PBMCs of normal human donors. Consistent with these results, ADG152 shows significantly decreased ability (more than 100-fold) compared with the benchmark and the unmasked parental molecule to activate CD8+ T cells and to induce T cell-mediated killing in the presence of tumor cells in vitro . ADG152 demonstrated strong anti-tumor effects in vivo . In a human PBMC-engrafted Raji xenograft mouse tumor model, dosing with ADG152 resulted in almost complete tumor growth inhibition at 1.5 mg/kg. In exploratory toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, ADG152 resulted in significantly less cytokine release in monkey blood compared with benchmark, giving ~100-fold safety margin for ADG152 for cytokine induction (Figure). In addition, ADG152 was as effective as the benchmark at inducing B cell depletion from peripheral blood of cynomolgus monkeys. In summary, the preclinical characterization of ADG152 demonstrates that our SAFEbody platform can be used to engineer safe and potent bispecific T cell engagers with increased therapeutic index by allowing for strong anti-tumor activities in mice at doses with minimal cytokine release in monkeys, thereby supporting its advancement to clinical development either as a single agent or in combination with other therapies for the treatment of CD20-expressing B cell malignancies.
