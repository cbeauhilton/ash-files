    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) cells are characterized by cell cycle dysregulation, epigenetic heterogeneity, and perturbation of the transcriptional landscape. We have previously shown that chemical and genetic perturbation of transcriptional regulator CDK7 significantly and selectively impacted MM cell growth and viability, supporting it as a pharmacologically relevant target for MM. Indeed, selective CDK7 inhibitor YKL-5-124 was active against a large panel of MM cell lines and primary MM cells, with a significantly lower IC50 compared to PHA-activated normal donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The efficacy of YKL-5-124 was confirmed in vivo in several murine models of MM, including disseminated models. Gene expression analysis after CDK7 inhibition in several MM cell lines revealed that transcripts for only a subset of genes were substantially affected by treatment with low dose of YKL-5-124, showing a strong leading-edge enrichment for downregulation of E2F expression program, cell cycle, DNA damage, and MYC targets. We have indeed confirmed a potent reduction in phosphorylation of RB protein, with consequent decrease of E2F activity in MM cells, supporting CDK7 as a central hub in the oncogenic CDK-pRb-E2F pathway in MM cells, with its expression and activity positively correlated with E2F transcriptional output in patient MM cells. Importantly, dual inhibition with low doses of YKL-5-124 and BRD4 inhibitor JQ1, displayed superior activity against a panel of MM cell lines and primary MM cells compared to single perturbation alone by both converging on a subset of key SE-associated dependencies as well as impacting distinct oncogenic expression programs. To identify synthetically lethal targets and mechanisms of resistance to CDK7 inhibition, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen in the MM1S cells treated with YKL-5-124 or DMSO. We found that BCL6, NFKBIA and B, TRAF2, TSC1 and CSNK2A1, a subunit of CK2, were top synthetically lethal hits; whereas deletion of RB1, SF3B3 and the DNA-binding transcriptional activator TADA2A that regulates RNA-pol II transcription, led to resistance to YKL-5-124. Molecular mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance to CDK7 inhibition are now under investigation and will be presented. In conclusion, our study demonstrates CDK7 as an attractive molecular vulnerability in MM that can be exploited therapeutically alone or in combination. Disclosures Shirasaki:  FIMECS: Consultancy.
