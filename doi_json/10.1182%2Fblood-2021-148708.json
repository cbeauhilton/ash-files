    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological malignancy, characterized by an increased reliance on mitochondria-related energetic pathways including oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Consistent with this, the electron transport chain (ETC), a component of OXPHOS has been demonstrated to be a suitable anti-leukemia target, with ETC complex I inhibitors currently in clinical development. Relative to its counterparts, complex II (CII) is unique in that it directly links the ETC to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle through succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity. Moreover, it is the only ETC complex with elevated activity in AML, relative to normal hematopoietic samples, with indirect inhibition selectively targeting AML cells. However, direct CII inhibition in AML has not been previously investigated, nor have the mechanisms underlying the divergent fates of AML and normal cells upon CII inhibition. A genetic approach was first used to assess the effects of CII impairment on AML growth in vitro and in vivo . Using lentiviral mediated shRNA we generated AML cell lines lacking succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor 1 (Sdhaf1). Sdhaf1 knockdown suppressed CII activity, cell proliferation and clonogenic growth across all three cell lines and delayed leukemia growth in vivo . To recapitulate these effects through a pharmacological approach, we aimed to identify a novel CII inhibitor, since currently available inhibitors are only effective at high doses and are neurotoxic. Through an in silico structural screen and molecular docking study, shikonin was identified as a small molecule that selectively binds to CII. Shikonin inhibited CII activity in the AML cells lines and patient-derived samples, and selectively killed AML cells (EC 50 : 1.0\u03bcM \u00b1 0.04) while sparing normal progenitors. In murine engraftment models, shikonin (2.0-3.0 mg/kg, 3x/week for 5 weeks) significantly reduced engraftment of patient-derived AML cells but had no effect on normal hematopoiesis. To further characterize the mechanisms governing the divergent cell fates of CII inhibition, we performed stable isotope metabolic tracing using 13 C 6 - glucose and 13 C 5 , 15 N 2 -glutamine in patient-derived AML cells and normal mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs). Both pharmacological and genetic loss of CII resulted in TCA cycle truncation by impairing oxidative metabolism of both glucose and glutamine. In Sdhaf1 knockdown and primary AML cells, this led to a depletion in steady state levels of TCA metabolites proceeding SDH. Inhibition of CII most notably suppressed levels of aspartate, a nucleotide precursor whose levels dictate the proliferative capacity of a cell under ETC dysfunction. Remarkably, MNCs maintained aspartate levels despite inhibition of CII, which was attributed to reductive carboxylation of glutamine, an alternate metabolic pathway that can regenerate TCA intermediates when OXPHOS is impaired. In contrast, while reductive carboxylation was also active in AML cells after CII inhibition, this activity was insufficient to maintain aspartate levels and resulted in metabolite depletion and cell death. Thus, loss of CII activity results in diverse cell fates whereby normal haematopoietic, but not AML cells sufficiently use reductive carboxylation of glutamine to overcome TCA cycle truncation, sustain aspartate levels and avert cell death. This is further evident through modulation of glutamine entry into the TCA cycle, where supplementation of cell-permeable \u03b1-ketoglutarate abrogated shikonin-mediated cell death while concomitant treatment with the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839, sensitized cells. Together, these results expose reductive carboxylation to support aspartate biosynthesis, as a novel metabolic vulnerability in AML that can be pharmacologically targeted through CII inhibition for clinical benefit.
