    "abstract_text": "Introduction There have been few recent therapeutic advances in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL), a rare and aggressive malignancy. Intensive chemotherapy +/- allogeneic transplantation (AlloHCT) can effect cure, realized by only a minority of adults. In distinction to B-ALL, there have been no safe/effective targeted therapies developed in T-ALL/LBL. We therefore performed a focused tissue array to identify novel tumor proteins, including CCR4; evaluated together with established immunophenotypic (IP) T-ALL/LBL subtypes [early-T-precursor (ETP), early non-ETP (Pre/Pro-T), common & late thymocyte]. We evaluated the clinical phenotype and outcome together with clinical and epidemiologic data in patients diagnosed at the 3-site Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC: Rochester, MN; Phoenix, AZ; and Jacksonville, FL). Methods Following IRB approval, we identified 50 consecutive T-ALL/LBL patients from 1997 -2019 diagnosed at the 3-site MCCC. Available remnant leukemia/lymphoma paraffin blocks were identified (n=28). Using immunohistochemistry (IHC) we evaluated expression of leukemic antigens of interest (CCR4, CD47, BCL2, BCL6, PD-L1, CD38 and CD123); these were selected based on clinical availability of novel targeted agents, approved or in development for other indications. Tissue array studies were performed and interpreted by a single hematopathologist (L.J) blinded to clinical data, using positive and negative controls, according to standard techniques. We also evaluated the clinical and epidemiological parameters, including different IP subtypes [ETP: CD1a-, sCD3- & CD8-, Pre/Pro-T: CD1a-, sCD3- & CD8+ or CD8- (11 marker T-ALL IP score was used to distinguish CD8- ETP vs. Pre/Pro-T), thymic: CD1a+ and mature: CD1a- & sCD3+] (Khogeer et al., Br J Haematol., 2019) & the presence of the unique MLLT10-PICALM fusion (n=6), as well as therapy and outcome. Comparisons of characteristics and outcomes of interest were made using a Wilcoxon rank sum test (continuous characteristics) or Fisher's exact test (categorical characteristics), unadjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models (overall survival), or unadjusted logistic regression models (complete remission after first line treatment). Results We identified the expression of novel targetable tissue proteins in all adult T-ALL/LBL cases [Table 1]. BCL2, CD38 & CD47 were expressed in majority of the cases, and CCR4 [Fig. 1] was expressed in 11/28 (39.3%) cases. CCR4 expression was significantly more common in the Pre/Pro-T (75%) vs. other IP subtypes (19%) (p=0.011); there was no other association of CCR4 expression with clinical characteristics/outcomes. We also observed differences in T-ALL vs. T-LBL, specifically T-ALL patients were more likely to be male (71% vs. LBL 38.9%, p=0.038). Surprisingly, T-LBL patients were more likely to have a family history of leukemia/lymphoma (41.2% vs. T-ALL 0%, p<0.001 ) . In addition, a significantly different distribution of IP subtype in T-LBL was noted [Table 2]. Not surprisingly, T-LBL patients were more likely to receive 1 st line Hyper-CVAD therapy (88.2% v. T-ALL 43.3%, p=0.005), & had a longer delay from diagnosis to initiation of therapy (median 14 vs. 4 days, p=0.012), however this did not appear to impact clinical outcome. In contrast, we observed an important association of IP subtype with outcome after therapy, including complete remission (p=0.035), & a trend suggesting differences in survival (p=0.069) [Table 3]. However, MLLT10-PICALM was not associated with any unique clinical features or with outcome (death, p=0.85; CR, p=0.98), although 4/6 patients underwent AlloHCT, suggesting an important role of AlloHCT in this subgroup. No other significant association of epidemiologic risk factors with phenotype or outcome was noted. Conclusion Using focused tissue array we have identified expression of tumor associated proteins in T-ALL/LBL including CCR4 (Pre/Pro-T IP) & others, which may be targets of therapeutic agents like mogamulizumab. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates an important clinical impact of IP subtype in T-ALL/LBL, as well as important clinical & therapeutic differences in T-ALL vs. LBL. This study will help guide development of targeted clinical trials in T-ALL/LBL (CCR4 trial already in development). Further analyses are planned to determine the clinical & epidemiologic association of genetic lesions in this cohort.
