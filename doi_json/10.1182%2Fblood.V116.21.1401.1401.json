    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1401 Introduction: Topical bovine thrombin has been used for over 30 years as an adjunct to accelerate intraoperative hemostasis for minor oozing or bleeding. Antibody-mediated hemostatic abnormalities suggested in case reports and small uncontrolled case series have raised safety concerns about topical bovine thrombin preparations. However, in 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the only currently available topical bovine thrombin (Thrombin-JMI \u00ae ) with topical recombinant (Chapman WC et al, J Am Coll Surg 2007;205:256-265) or plasma-derived (Doria C et al, CMRO 2008;24:785-794) human thrombins, similar efficacy and safety profiles were established for all 3 preparations. Study Goals: To characterize the primary and secondary immune responses following intraoperative exposure and potential re-exposure to topical bovine thrombin and explore any potential relationship to hemostatic abnormalities. Study Design: This prospective, observational cohort study enrolled 554 patients from 50 US sites who were scheduled to undergo surgery and had a previous surgical procedure \u22644 years earlier with probable intraoperative exposure to topical bovine thrombin. Cohorts were defined prospectively but assigned at the conclusion of the study period, based on the presence or absence of human anti-bovine thrombin antibodies (aBT) in preoperative (baseline) plasma samples and intraoperative exposure or non-exposure to THROMBIN-JMI \u00ae . The primary study cohort included patients with aBT pre-surgery who received THROMBIN-JMI \u00ae during the study surgery, whereas the primary reference cohort was comprised of patients with no aBT pre-surgery who did not receive THROMBIN-JMI \u00ae during study surgery. The primary end point was the mean change from baseline in aPTT at 48 h post-surgery. Secondary analyses included explorations of the relationships between changes in aBT, human anti-bovine factor V/Va antibodies (aBV/Va), human anti-human thrombin antibodies (aHT), human anti-human factor V/Va antibodies (aHV/Va) and coagulation parameters at 48 h and 4 and 8 weeks after surgery as well as incidences of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Results: The adjusted mean change in aPTT values at 48 h post-surgery for the primary study cohort exceeded that for the primary reference cohort by 2.03 sec (1-sided 97.5% upper confidence bound [UCB] of 4.67 sec). The UCB exceeded the prespecified 4.5 sec non-inferiority margin (chosen as 15% of expected mean baseline aPTT of 30 sec). Hence, non-inferiority was not met. Of note, the observed baseline aPTT in this study population was higher than expected (32.38 sec) and non-inferiority would have been met had the non-inferiority margin been a relative margin a priori set at 15% of baseline aPTT. There were no significant differences in the mean aPTT change observed in all other cohort comparisons at 48 h post-surgery. Similarly, there was no significant prolongation of the aPTT at 4 and 8 weeks post-surgery in any of the cohort comparisons. Moreover, exposure to THROMBIN-JMI \u00ae did not lead to any change in immunologic (aHT, aBT, aHV/Va, or aBV/Va) markers at 48 h post-surgery. Immunologic markers evident at 4 or 8 weeks post-surgery demonstrated no relationship to any changes in coagulation measures. There was no evidence of any effect of prior exposure to thrombin, current THROMBIN-JMI \u00ae treatment, or presence of pre-surgery aBT on the incidence of TEAEs. Overall, these data indicate that in patients treated with THROMBIN-JMI \u00ae the presence of pre-surgery aBT or aBV/Va does not lead to impaired hemostasis. Conclusion: Primary or secondary immune responses to perioperative exposure/re-exposure to THROMBIN-JMI \u00ae do not adversely affect hemostasis after surgery. These results confirm earlier conclusions from 2 RCTs comparing topical bovine thrombin and recombinant and plasma-derived human thrombins.
