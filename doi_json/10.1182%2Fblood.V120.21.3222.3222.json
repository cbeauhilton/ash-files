    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3222 Objective: An elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) by echocardiography, used to screen for pulmonary hypertension (PH) and mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD), likely has a multi-factorial etiology. SCD is a hyper-coagulable state, yet, the contribution of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) to an elevated TRV is unknown. Based on the known association between VTE and PH, we hypothesized that SCD patients with an elevated TRV will have an increased prevalence of VTE. Methods: We reviewed data collected prospectively as part of the PH in SCD study conducted at Boston University/Boston Medical Center from 2004\u20132010. Subjects were included if they underwent both echocardiography and testing for VTE. An elevated TRV was defined as > 2.5 m/sec or the presence of PH on right heart catheterization. A history of VTE was defined by a positive CT/angiogram, ventilation/perfusion scan or Duplex ultrasound of an extremity (not catheter-related). Data were analyzed using a Chi-Square test and an odds ratio for VTE was calculated. Results: We reviewed the records of 162 patients enrolled in the PH of SCD study; 97 underwent both echocardiography and an evaluation for VTE.5/53 patients (9.4%) with normal echocardiography had a history of VTE, compared with 13/44 (29.5%) in the elevated TRV group. SCD patients with an elevated TRV were four times more likely to have a history of VTE compared to those with a normal echocardiogram (OR: 4.03, 95% CI 1.31\u201312.41, p=0.011). There was no significant difference in age, gender, history of asthma, hemoglobin genotype, hematologic profiles or renal function between patient groups. Conclusion: An elevated TRV and PH are associated with a history of VTE in SCD patients. This suggests a role for thrombosis in disease modulation and underscores the need for a complete evaluation for VTE in SCD patients with an elevated TRV.
