    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4585 Background and Aims: Reduced serum IgM levels were proposed as an unfavorable prognostic factor in multiple myeloma 1 . We therefore investigated the possible impact of decreased serum IgM concentrations on the outcome of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients, a disease that is frequently characterized by severe hypogammaglobulinemia. Serum IgM levels were measured by 2 methods. Patients and methods: 188 patients with CLL were studied. Of them 54%, 27%,10%, 7% \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 2% where in RAI stage 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively while 65%, 22% and 13% in Binet stages A, B and C. IgM was determined at diagnosis by both classical nephelometry and the new Hevylite\u2122 methods; the first measures total IgM levels while the second one measures the immunoglobulin fractions bound to either kappa or lambda light chains therefore enabling us to determine the ratio of IgM-kappa/lambda (HLCR). Hevylite\u2122 measurements were retrospectively performed in 69/188 patients with available frozen sera aliquots from drawn at the time of diagnosis. Of them the Ig subclasses IgMkappa and IgMlambda, IgGkappa and IgGlambda, IgAkappa and IgAlambda (HLC) were measured by Hevylite\u2122 antibodies nephelometrically. Light chain restriction (kappa or lambda) was determined by flow cytometry or bone marrow/lymph node biopsy immunohistochemistry. The ratios (HLCRs) were calculate with the monoclonal immunoglobulin as numerator, i.e IgMkappa/IgMlambda, IgGkappa/IgGlambda and IgAkappa,/IgAlambda in kappa-restricted patients and IgMlambda/IgMkappa, IgGlambda/IgGkappa, IgAlambda/IgAkappa in lambda-ones. Serum IgM concentration by both methods were related to time to first treatment (TFT) and overall survival (OS). Statistical analysis was performed conventionally; survival curves were drawn by Kaplan-Meyer method and compared by the log-rank test. Results: Total IgM ranged from 12 to 246 mg/dl (median 47.6). The sum of IgMkappa plus IgMlambda from 12 to 369 (median 60). IgMkappa from 7.9 to 349 mg/dL (median 41) in kappa-restricted patients and IgMlambda from 7.6 \u03c9\u03b6 98 mg/dL (median 22) in lambda restricted ones. Low total IgM level (<50 mg/dL) was present in 52% of patients but it did not correlate to TFT or OS. Summated IgMkappa plus IgMlambda lower than 50 mg/dL was present in 41% and correlated with worse OS (p=0.016). Furthermore non-clonal IgM subclass suppression correlated with TFT (p=0.019) and OS (p=0.021). The same was not confirmed for non-clonal IgG and IgA subclasses suppression. Finally IgM-HLCR was abnormal in 35% of patients. Of them, 25% had also abnormal IgG-HLCR and/or IgA-HLCRs leading to the hypothesis of multiple clones coexistence within the neoplastic B-cell lymphocytic population. Conclusions: Low IgM levels determined by novel immunoassays (Hevylite\u2122) correlate to shorter TFT and OS in patients with CLL. Their use may reveal new disease characteristic and are suggestive of a multi-oligoclonal disorder. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
