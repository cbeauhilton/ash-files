    "abstract_text": "Objective To explore the relationship among CD 4 + CD 25 + regulatory T cell, the expression of FOXP 3 mRNA levels of donor bone marrow (BM) and graft versus host disease (GVHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Methods Thirty patients undergoing allo-HSCT were enrolled in this study. The levels of donor CD 4 + CD 25 + regulatory T cell were compared in the patients with GVHD and those without GVHD by immnofluorescence and flowcytometry. The donor BM expressions of Foxp3 mRNA levels were analyzed by using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results All patients achieved engraftment. ANC \u22650.5\u00d710 9 /L and PLT \u2265 20\u00d710 9 /L were at day 14(range, 12\u201315)and day 18 (range, 15\u201325) respectively. With a median follow-up of 12.8 (8\u201316) months, Acute GVHD occurred in 15 of 30 patients(50.0%) with gradeII\u2013IV Acute GVHD (40.0%). Chronic GVHD developed in 6 (extensive 2, limited 4) out of 30 patients (20.0%). The levels of donor CD 4 + CD 25 + regulatory T cell pre-and pro-mobilization were (2.67\u00b10.38)% and (5.01\u00b11.33)% respectively, no difference were observed ( P >0.05). Patients with I\u2013II aGVHD demonstrated higher donor-type CD 4 + CD 25 + immune regulatory T cell level than those with III\u2013IV aGVHD; Patients with III\u2013IV aGVHD showed much lower donor-type CD 4 + CD 25 + immune regulatory T cell level than those without GVHD; no difference were observed between patients withI\u2013II aGVHD and those without aGVHD. The transcripts of FOXP 3 donor BM were detected in seven donors of thirty recipients who received allo-HSCT. Five patients had no GVHD after transplantation;two developedIaGVHD. Donor BM Foxp3 transcripts were never detected in patients with II\u2013IV aGVHD. Conclusion Donor-type CD 4 + CD 25 + immune regulatory T cell level was relative to recipient II\u2013IV aGVHD. Up-grade donor-type CD 4 + CD 25 + immune regulatory T cell level could reduce the incidence of aGVHD. Donor BM FOXP 3 transcripts were detected in patients without serious aGVHD after transplantation."
