    "abstract_text": "An essential prerequisite for the development of more effective targeted therapies in AML is a characterization of the frequency and biological properties of leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which sustain the disease and mediate relapse. Previous studies have shown that hematopoietic stem cells, as well as progenitors, may be targeted by MLL oncoproteins to give rise to AML, however it was unclear whether these lineage negative cells also functioned as LSCs to sustain disease. To address this issue, we have identified and characterized LSCs in a somatic, genetic mouse model of leukemia that faithfully recapitulates many of the pathologic and clinical attributes of human leukemia initiated by the MLL\u2212AF9 oncogene. In this model, CFCs in the bone marrow and spleen of leukemic mice were demonstrated to be LSCs, based on the observation that secondary transplantation of the progeny of individually isolated AML CFCs cultured in vitro for seven days or longer invariably resulted in transfer of short latency disease. These self\u2212renewing cells were remarkably frequent, accounting for 25\u201330% of myeloid lineage cells at late\u2212stage disease. Unexpectedly, they expressed mature myeloid lineage antigens (91.3 \u00b1 3.8% Mac1+ Gr1+ immunophenotype, versus fewer than 0.2% lineage negative), placing them downstream of the known hematopoietic progenitor compartment. Furthermore, LSCs in this model generated a phenotypic, morphologic and functional leukemia cell hierarchy loosely defined by expression of c\u2212kit. When compared with immortalized progenitors, LSCs exhibited a markedly enhanced ability to engraft secondary recipients, which was not due to differences in bone marrow homing, which was equivalently poor in the compared populations. Rather, LSCs exhibited an acquired ability to proliferate in response to stromal cell derived cytokines, an enhanced SDF1 induced chemotaxis, and increased proliferation in contact with OP9 stromal cells demonstrating that LSCs exhibit altered microenvironmental interactions by comparison with the oncogene immortalized CFCs that initiated the disease. Thus, the LSCs responsible for sustaining, expanding and regenerating MLL\u2212AF9 AML are downstream myeloid lineage cells, outside of the normal stem and progenitor compartment. They have acquired an aberrant Hox\u2212associated self\u2212renewal program as well as other biologic features of hematopoietic stem cells. Our findings support a revision of the prevailing hypothesis that AML LSCs are always rare and solely located within the most immature bone marrow progenitor compartment. Furthermore, LSCs exhibit markedly different microenvironmental interactions, by comparison with cells simply immortalized by MLL\u2212AF9, indicating that acquisition of sensitivity to stromal derived survival and proliferative signals is a critical feature of LSCs, in addition to their extensive self\u2212renewal capabilities.",
