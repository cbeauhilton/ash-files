    "abstract_text": "Mice that express 20% the normal levels of the Ets transcription factor PU.1 develop AML, unlike mice that express 50% or 80% the normal levels, indicating that PU.1 is a dosage-sensitive tumor suppressor gene. In addition, 3 of 13 AMLs induced by transplanting mice with cells transduced with a Sox4 oncogene-containing retrovirus were found to carry a Sox4 retroviral integration in one PU.1 allele, suggesting that downregulation of PU.1 may cooperate with Sox4 in AML induction. Since the other PU.1 allele remains intact in these AMLs and a 50% decrease in PU.1 expression is not sufficient to induce AML, we hypothesized that Sox4 might further downregulate PU.1 expression in these AMLs. To test this hypothesis, we transfected HL60 cells with an expression vector carrying GFP and Sox4 cDNA or a GFP vector control alone. PU.1 mRNA levels were consistently downregulated 4 to 10 fold in cells transfected with Sox4 cDNA compared to cells transfected with the vector control, confirming that overexpression of Sox4 downregulates PU.1 expression in myeloid cells. The decrease of PU.1 mRNA was observed as early as 8 hours after Sox4 transfection, further suggesting that Sox4 may directly interact with PU.1 in myeloid cells. Consistent with this, analysis of 2 published microarray databases comprising 401 de novo AML patient samples showed that SOX4 expression is significantly negatively correlated with PU.1 expression (coefficient: \u22120.337, P-value: 1E-07). In order to confirm that downregulation of PU.1 cooperates with Sox4 in AML induction, we infected wild type or PU.1 heterozygous knockout bone marrow cells with the Sox4 retrovirus and then monitored the time of AML development in transplanted mice. Results showed increased penetrance (95%) of myeloid leukemia in mice transplanted with Sox4-infected PU +/\u2013 bone marrow compared to mice receiving Sox4-infected wild type marrow (60%). Myeloid leukemia was confirmed by histology in all animals of the Sox4-infected PU +/ cohort while T cell lymphoma was diagnosed in 3 animals of the Sox4 wild type cohort. Together, all experiments support the hypothesis that Sox4 cooperates with the transcription factor PU.1.",
