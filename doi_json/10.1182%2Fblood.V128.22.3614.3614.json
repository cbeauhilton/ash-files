    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Platinum and anthracyclin chemotherapy regimens are frequently used in hematology pts and compromised by severe acute and delayed CINV. NEPA, a fixed dose combination of the long lasting NK 1 -receptor antagonist (RA) netupitant and the pharmacological distinct 5HT 3 -RA palonosetron, has been approved by FDA and EMA for the prevention of acute and delayed CINV receiving highly emetogenic cisplatin- and AC-based as well as moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. A German non-interventional study is currently investigating NEPA's efficacy and impact on quality of life in adult cancer patients by PRO and physicians' personal assessment under real life conditions. Objectives: Primary objective is to evaluate quality of life (QoL) in adult patients receiving NEPA for CINV prevention. Secondary endpoints are efficacy and safety of NEPA. Methods: This open label, non-interventional, prospective, national, multicenter study evaluates CINV prevention and patients' QoL with NEPA in 2,500 pts receiving either highly or moderately emetogenic cytostatics on up to 2 consecutive days. NEPA is prescribed in accordance with the EU marketing authorization. QoL is evaluated by the validated FLIE questionnaire for 3 chemotherapy cycles 24 hours before, within 24 hours after and additional 4 days after chemotherapy. Efficacy is documented via patient diaries for the same time period. Safety and physicians' overall satisfaction is reported via eCRF. The interim analysis reports on the first 20% of the pre-planned number of patients. Results: Between June 2015 and July 2016 a total of 583 patients were enrolled. Median age was 56 (range of 28-88) with 521 out of 583 patients that completed documentation. A total of 291 patients (56%) received AC-based chemotherapy. Efficacy, evaluated by physicians' personal assessment on a 4-point scale, was rated very good or good for 486 (90.7%), 409 (93.4%) and 350 (92.9%) patients in cycle 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Complete response was analyzed based on 87 completed patient diaries. Here, 88.5% reported no emesis and no rescue medication in the acute phase (0-24h post chemotherapy), while 85.1% and 79.3% reported complete response in the delayed (>24-120h post chemotherapy) and overall phase (0-120h post chemotherapy). A high percentage of patients did not suffer from any emesis (94%, 99% and 93% in acute, delayed and overall phase). The study is ongoing. Conclusions: NEPA proved to be highly effective for prevention of chemotherapy-induced emesis and nausea. Patient reported outcome was rated very good or good in more than 90% of Ctx cycles in the acute as the delayed phase of highly and moderately emetogenic Ctx including cisplatin or anthracyclin based therapy.
