    "abstract_text": "We sought to determine the differences in molecular response between early and late CP pts with CML who achieved a CCR after treatment with IM at the standard dose of 400mg/d. We studied 2 different cohorts of patients in CCR: 67/191 (35%) pts after \u03b1-Interferon (\u03b1-IFN) failure enrolled on the CML/002/STI571 protocol 53/76 (70%) pts treated front line with a combination of IM and pegilated IFN-\u03b1 (PEG-IFN) enrolled on the CML/011/STI571 protocol Cytogenetic response was monitored on bone marrow (BM) metaphases and molecular response was assessed by real time RT-PCR (TaqMan) BM and peripheral blood (PB) samples, collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months during the first year, and every 6 months thereafter. Molecular response was expressed as the ratio between BCR/ABL and \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22-M) x100. The lowest level of detectability of the method was 10 \u22125 . Negative results (i.e. undetectable transcript) were confirmed by nested PCR performed 4 times (sensitivity 10 \u22126 ). For the purpose of this analysis, a major molecular response (MMR) was defined as a BCR-ABL/\u03b22M value <0.0001%, which turned out to be roughly equivalent to a 3-log reduction and a complete molecular response (CMR) was defined as negative (undetectable) BCR/ABL levels confirmed by nested PCR. We observed a progressive decrease of the amount of BCR/ABL transcript in pts who achieved a CCR. At 24 months the median reduction in BCR/ABL transcript level was: a 3-log reduction in late CP pts a 4-log reduction in early CP pts In the latter group of pts MR was assessed also at 36 months. So we observed that 36 months after the first dose of IM and PEG-IFN pts who were still in CCR had the median value of BCR/ABL transcript of 0.00001% both in BM and PB. Therefore all these pts achieved a MMR. However only 8/53 (4%) pts were in CMR (undetectable BCR/ABL at least once as assessed by nested PCR). We conclude that front-line treatment with IM results in a better quality MR (4-log reduction in BCR/ABL transcript levels in early CP pts, as against a 3-log reduction in late CP pts).
