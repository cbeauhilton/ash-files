    "abstract_text": "When vascular endothelium is injured, circulating platelets are activated by primary agonists. Activation causes platelets to change shape, aggregate, and release secondary agonists which reinforce initial platelet activation as well as help recruit additional platelets to the site of vascular injury. MAP kinases have been shown to be important regulators of platelet function and secondary agonist production. One important secondary agonist released by activated platelets is TxA 2 . TxA 2 is generated by metabolism of Arachidonic acid (AA). AA is released from platelet membrane phospholipids via the activity of PLAs. In platelets cPLA 2 activity has been shown to be regulated by MAP kinases, however, the mechanisms which regulate platelet MAP kinase activity are not well understood. Our laboratory has identified that ASK1 (a Ser/Thr kinase of the MAP3K family) is present in both human and murine platelets and is activated by physiological agonists. ASK1 is known to be activated by a number of cellular stress response pathways. When challenged by cellular stress, ASK1 auto phosphorylates Thr845 on its activation loop, which is required for its ability to phosphorylate its substrates. Here we show that ASK1 regulates platelet function in part by regulating agonist-induced TxA 2 generation. To determine the role of Ask1 in hemostasis and thrombosis, we evaluated in vivo thrombosis using carotid artery injury induced by 10% FeCl 3 or pulmonary thromboembolism induced by injecting mixture of collagen/epinephrine. We found that genetic ablation of Ask1 renders mice significant protection from thrombosis. To determine the mechanism by which Ask1 regulates platelet activation leading to thrombosis, we evaluated the MAP kinase cascade using Ask1 null platelets. We found that genetic ablation of Ask1 blocked agonist-induced activation of the MAP2Ks (MKK3 and MKK4) in murine platelets. Since MKK3 can activate p38 and MKK4 can activate both p38 and JNK, we assessed MAPKs activation in murine platelets. When stimulated by various agonists, activation of p38 was entirely lost in Ask1 null platelets while activation of ERK1/2 and JNK remained unaffected indicating that Ask1 solely regulates p38 activity in platelets. Activity of p38 has been linked to agonist-induced generation of TxA 2 , an important contributing factor to thrombosis. We therefore evaluated agonist-induced production of TxA 2 by measuring TxB 2 (a stable metabolite of TxA 2 ). We saw a substantial reduction (~50% in thrombin- and ~70% in convulxin-induced) production of TxA 2 in Ask1 null platelets suggesting a separate Ask1 independent mechanism for TxA 2 generation. Since TxA 2 is a metabolite of AA, whose production in platelets is caused by cPLA 2 enzymatic activity and cPLA 2 activity is regulated by phosphorylation of its Ser505 residue by p38, we evaluated phosphorylation of cPLA 2 (p-Ser505). We found that agonist-induced phosphorylation of cPLA 2 (Ser505) was completely lost in Ask1 null platelets. Although in Ask1 null platelets cPLA 2 phosphorylation (Ser505) is completely abolished, substantial amount (~50%) of TxA 2 was generated in response to thrombin suggesting that there exists an Ask1 independent mechanism of activation of cPLA 2 . To rule out the possibility that an alternative PLA 2 is responsible for the residual TxA 2 production found in Ask1 null platelets, we evaluated agonist-induced TxA 2 production in the presence of pyrrophenone, a cPLA 2 specific inhibitor. Pretreatment with pyrrophenone completely abolished agonist-induced TxA 2 production in murine as well as human platelets, suggesting that cPLA 2 is solely responsible for the majority of agonist induced AA/TxA 2 in platelets. In addition to its phosphorylation, it is documented that cPLA 2 activity is also dependent on intracellular Ca 2+ , which facilitates translocation of cPLA2 to AA containing membranes. It is therefore possible that the remainder of TxA 2 formed is dependent on Ca 2+ -dependent activity of cPLA 2 . Taken together these in vivo and in vitro results strongly suggest that ASK1 plays a key role in regulating thrombosis, in part, by regulating the signaling mechanisms involved in agonist-induced production of TxA 2 .
