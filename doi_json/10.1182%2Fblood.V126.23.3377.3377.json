    "abstract_text": "Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is a major genetic modifier of the phenotypic heterogeneity in patients with the major \u03b2-globin disorders sickle cell disease (SCD) and \u03b2-thalassemia. Although the normal level of HbF postnatally is approximately 1% of total hemoglobin, some individuals have a condition known as hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH), characterized by elevated synthesis of \u03b3-globin in adulthood. HPFH is caused by small or large deletions in the \u03b2-globin locus (deletional HPFH), or point mutations in the A \u03b3-globin or G \u03b3-globin gene promoters (non-deletional HPFH). Pharmacological agents such as butyrate, decitabine, and hydroxyurea are effective in inducing HbF in vitro and in vivo . To date, hydroxyurea is the only drug approved for clinical use in sickle cell patients, although the efficacy level is variable between patients and the long-term effects of this drug remain uncertain. Therefore, current research has focused on elucidating the pathways involved in the maintenance/reactivation of \u03b3-globin gene expression in adult life. Many studies have demonstrated the role of stage-specific transcription factors in \u03b2-like globin gene switching, indicating their potential as therapeutic targets in the treatment of \u03b2-hemoglobinopathies. In order to better understand the molecular pathways involved in the regulating \u03b3-globin gene expression, we used \u03b2-YAC transgenic mice, produced with a 213 Kb \u03b2-globin locus yeast artificial chromosome, containing a 187 Kb human chromosomal insert encompassing the entire 82 Kb \u03b2-globin locus from 5'HS5 of the LCR to 3'HS1, approximately 20 Kb downstream from the \u03b2-globin gene. Four different transgenic mouse lines were included in this study: 1) wild \u03b2-YAC mice, with the normal sequence of the human \u03b2-globin locus; 2) mutant \u03b2-YAC mice with the A \u03b3-globin -117 G>A HPFH mutation 3) mutant \u03b2-YAC mice with the A \u03b3-globin -175 T>C HPFH mutation, and 4) mutant \u03b2-YAC mice with the A \u03b3-globin -195 T>C HPFH mutation. Adult -175 and -195 mutant \u03b2-YAC mice displayed an HPFH phenotype with an increased level of HbF. As measured by HPLC, -175 HPFH mice had the highest average level of \u03b3-globin chains [16.4% \u03b3/(\u03b3+\u03b2)], followed by -195 HPFH mice (8.4%). Wild-type \u03b2-YAC control mice averaged 2.8% and -117 Greek HPFH \u03b2-YAC control mice displayed an average of 7.4%. Measurement of A \u03b3-globin mRNA by RNase protection analysis (RNAP) supported the HPLC data; \u03b3/(\u03b3+\u03b2) was 34%, 12.1%, 14.1% and less than 0.5% for -175 HPFH, -195 HPFH, -117 HPFH and wild-type \u03b2-YAC animals, respectively. Relative mRNA levels as determined by RT-qPCR were consistent with the RNAP results. Currently, we are examining our -175 and -195 HPFH mice for pancellular versus heterocellular distribution of HbF. To examine the molecular basis for the -175 and 195 HPFH phenotypes, fetal livers of these animals were collected on day E18 of gestation, after the fetal-to-adult \u03b2-like globin switch occurred, for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of transcription factor/co-factor binding, including YY1, PAX1, TAL1, LMO2 and LDB1. Previous unpublished DNA-protein array and ChIP data, comparing human primary erythroid cell cultures from normal donors and -195 HPFH individuals, showed a 6-fold enrichment of YY1 recruitment to the -195 region of the normal A \u03b3-globin promoter and a 5-fold enrichment of PAX1 recruitment to the HPFH mutant promoter, suggesting that YY1 may act as an A \u03b3-globin gene repressor and PAX1 may be an activator when the -195 mutation is present. Preliminary ChIP experiments in \u03b2-YAC mice showed a similar pattern with YY1 enriched 2-fold in wild-type mice and PAX1 enriched 2-fold in -195 HPFH animals. Regarding -175 HPFH and wild-type \u03b2-YAC samples, we found occupancy enrichment of LMO2, TAL1 and LDB1 proteins (1.5-fold, 9-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively) in the -175 region of the A \u03b3-globin gene promoter in -175 HPFH \u03b2-YAC mice. Recently published studies in cell lines have shown that these three proteins form a complex with GATA-1 to mediate long-range interactions between the LCR and \u03b2-like globin genes. These mouse models provide additional tools for studying the regulation of \u03b3-globin gene expression and may reveal new targets for selectively activating HbF.
