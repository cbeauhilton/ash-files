    "abstract_text": "Background Nilotinib is approved for use in pts with CML after failure of imatinib and in newly diagnosed CP-CML. In the ENESTnd trial, 1 st line nilotinib was associated with a higher frequency of hypercholesterolemia than imatinib. Moreover, several studies reported a nilotinib-associated risk of artery occlusive disease (AOD). In ENESTnd, pre-existing treatment for dyslipidemia did not preclude pts from enrolment. To avoid this pitfall and to determine which cholesterol fractions are affected and whether triglycerides (TG) are modified, we prospectively studied the plasma lipid profile of nilotinib-treated pts without drug treatment for dyslipidemia. Methods Pts (n=25) in our center with CP-CML either newly diagnosed or after failure of imatinib were proposed 1 st or 2 nd line nilotinib provided that neither very high risk for fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) nor nilotinib-resistant ABL kinase domain mutation were present at baseline. Pts with drug treatment for dyslipidemia at baseline were excluded from this study. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and TG were measured prior to the start of nilotinib and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Fasting glucose (FG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) were also measured. Results are shown as medians (min-max). ESC/EAS 2012 guidelines were used to determine CVD risk categories and for the management of dyslipidemias. Results Median age at nilotinib initiation was 52 years (19-69), 13 were males (52%). Sokal risk group was low in 11 pts (44%), intermediate in 11 (44%) and high in 3 (12%). Nilotinib was given upfront in 20 pts (80%) and after 1 st line imatinib in 5 pts (20%). Median time from diagnosis was 0.8 month (0.4-4.3) in the former and 15.7 months (2.5-47.9) in the latter. Initial nilotinib dosing regimen was 300mg BID in 22 pts (88%) and 400mg BID in 3 pts (12%). Baseline CVD risk factors included age \u2265 45 years in men and \u2265 55 years in women in 33 pts (52%), active smoking or ceased during the previous year in 6 pts (24%), body mass index (BMI) \u2265 25 kg/m 2 in 14 pts (56%), hypertension in 1 pt (4%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in 1 pt (4%). Two pts were discovered pre DM. The CVD risk was low in 12 pts (48%), moderate in 11 pts (44%) and high in 2 pts (8%). At baseline, no pt required drug intervention by lipid lowering agents based on LDL-C, 11 pts (44%) had low HDL-C (\u22640.4g/L) and 7 (28%) had high TG (\u22651.5g/L). Median FG and HBA1C were 0.88g/L (0.63-1.26) and 5.5% (4.7-6.5), respectively. All pts were given lifestyle medical advice. At M3, TC, LDL-C and HDL-C had increased by a mean of 26.9%, 31.8% and 36.3%, respectively. Median TC at baseline and M3 was 1.84g/L (1.17-2.74) and 2.27g/L (1.08-3.62) (p<0.0001). Median LDL-C at baseline and M3 was 1.13g/L (0.69-2.02) and 1.45g/L (0.68-2.7) (p=0.00012). Median HDL-C at baseline and M3 was 0.42g/L (0.16-0.77) and 0.55g/L (0.27-0.99) (p<0.0001). Only 3 pts (12%) had low HDL-C at M3. In contrast, TG decreased by a mean of -22.3%. Median TG at baseline and M3 was 1.02g/L (0.38-4.18) and 0.8g/L (0.41-3.83) (p=0.0003). Only 2 pts (8%) had high TG at M3. No further significant change was observed beyond M3 with median TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TG at M12 of 2.2g/L (1.15-2.9), 1.3g/L (0.69-1.84), 0.52g/L (0.38-1.27) and 0.83g/L (0.37-1.61), respectively. Finally, 1 pt developed type 2 DM at M12. Three pts (12%) required statins during the first year of nilotinib therapy: 2 pts with a moderate CVD risk at baseline and in whom LDL-C rose above 1.9g/L and 1 pt with a moderate CVD risk at baseline who developed peripheral artery disease (PAD) at M12, leading to nilotinib discontinuation. By M12, the CVD risk changed from low to high in 1 pt due do to the onset of DM and from moderate to very high in the pt with PAD. Conclusions Nilotinib is associated with a significant and early increase in TC, LDL-C and HDL-C. In contrast, a decrease in TG occurs but this may be due to lifestyle medical advice given to our patients. All patients considered for nilotinib therapy should have an evaluation of blood lipids at baseline and early after the start of therapy. Requirement for lifestyle modifications and lipid lowering treatment by statins should be determined at baseline and throughout therapy according to TC, LDL-C and CVD risk category. The role of nilotinib-induced high LDL-C in the onset of AOD needs to be investigated. Disclosures: Rea: Novartis: Honoraria; BMS: Honoraria; Teva: Honoraria; Ariad: Honoraria; Pfizer: Honoraria.
