    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Aggressive histologic subtypes of lymphoma such as mantle cell (MCL) and activated B cell (ABC) are considered incurable and affected patients often have a short median survival despite multimodal therapy. It is well established that altered expression of oncogenes and epigenetic dysregulation of tumor suppressor and regulatory genes promote cellular transformation of normal B cells into malignant lymphoma. Hypermethylation of histone proteins (H3R8 and H4R3) by the protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) enzyme has been documented in multiple cancer types and has been shown to promote tumor cell growth and survival. Importantly, PRMT5 over expression does not occur in normal B cells (resting or activated) and is only detected in malignant lymphoma cells. We have previously shown that PRMT5 regulates the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) complex including EZH2, a core histone-lysine N methyl transferase. EZH2 has tumor suppressor functions and has been shown to regulate WNT antagonist\u2019s gene expression. WNT/\u03b2-CATENIN signaling pathway has been associated with increased cell proliferation and survival in various forms of cancers including lymphoma. Until recently, the role of PRMT5 in controlling WNT/\u03b2-CATENIN signaling has been unclear. We hypothesized that PRMT5, through its ability to repress EZH2 expression, would control WNT/\u03b2-CATENIN signaling and orchestrate downstream pathways that are relevant to lymphomagenesis. Methods : PRMT5 inhibition of patient-derived lymphoma cell lines, primary lymphoma tumor cells and mouse primary E\u03bc-BRD2 transgenic lymphoma cells by infecting with sh-PRMT5 lentivirus (or sh-GFP control) or a selective small molecule PRMT5 inhibitor (tool compound CMP5). Gene expression was monitored by immunoblotting and reverse transcription (RT) real time PCR. Recruitment of target proteins to promoter regions was examined by ChIP assays. To evaluate PRMT5 and WNT antagonist expression in NHL patient samples, primary tumor samples were collected from 4 patients with MCL. Cellular growth and apoptosis was assessed by proliferation assay and FACS analysis. Results : PRMT5 supports WNT/\u03b2-CATENIN activity by direct transcriptional repression of AXIN2 and WIF1 via a PRMT5-EZH2 repressor complex. PRMT5 indirectly supports EZH2 expression via inactivation of the RB-E2F pathway. AXIN2 and WIF1 are two proteins that negatively regulate WNT/bCATENIN. Additionally, PRMT5 inhibition with shRNA or CMP5 leads to repression of the WNT/\u03b2-CATENIN signaling pathway by allowing de-repression of AXIN2 and WIF1 , leading to decreased nuclear phospho-b-CATENIN and decreased transcription of the target genes CYCLIN D1 , c-MYC and SURVIVIN . Reduced nuclear localization of phospho-\u03b2-catenin (S675) led to differential enhanced recruitment of co-repressors LSD and HDAC2 (and loss of epigenetic marks H3K4Me3 and H3K9Me3) and loss of activating epigenetic marks H3K9Ac and H3K14Ac on CYCLIN D1 , c-MYC and SURVIVIN promoters. We also found that PRMT5 regulates target gene repression in primary blastic variant MCL patient samples and mouse primary lymphoma tumor cells. Significance: Our observations show that PRMT5 is an important epigenetic regulator that governs the expression of its own target genes, the PRC2 program as well as regulating the WNT/\u03b2-CATENIN-driven pro-growth and survival genes c-MYC , CYCLIND D1 and SURVIVIN . These results, together with the prevalence of PRMT5 and EZH2 over expression and activation of WNT targets in multiple lymphoma histologic subtypes, suggests that inhibiting PRMT5 is likely to result in removal of repressive histone arginine and lysine marks and promote restoration of normal growth and survival checkpoints in malignant lymphomas.
