    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5124 Background: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a common clinical problem. Inherited thrombophilia has been reported to be associated with RPL by different groups. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the records of women who had thrombophilia testing for RPL, defined as 2 or more pregnancy losses, between the period of June 2006 and June 2010. The following thrombophilic disorders were included: protein C deficiency (PC), protein S deficiency (PS), anti-thrombin deficiency (AT), activated protein C resistance (APCR) and more recently, as molecular testing became available at our institution, factor V G1691A (FVL), prothrombin G20210A (PTG) and Methyl tetrahydrofolate reductase C677T (MTHRF) mutations. Women were excluded if testing was only done during pregnancy or in the immediate post-partum period. Results: A total of 136 women were identified. Median age was 32 (range: 18\u201344) with a median number of RPL of 3 (range: 2\u201311). Median number of first trimester losses was 2 (range 0\u201311). Two women had only second trimester losses and one had only third trimester losses. PS deficiency was identified in 8 women (5.8%), PC deficiency in 3 (2.2%), AT deficiency in 1 (0.7%) and APCR in 1 (0.7%). Of 30 women who had genetic analysis by PCR, 8 had abnormal results (MTHFR: 4 heterozygous, 1 homozygous; FVL: 2 heterozygous and PTG: 1 heterozygous). We did not find any correlation between the number of RPLs and the finding of a positive thrombophilia screen in the overall group or in the group of women who had molecular testing. Conclusion: Inherited thrombophilia is not as common in our patient population as described in other groups. However, a prospective study with a control group and a full panel of thrombophilia testing is needed to assess the prevalence and significance of such defects in women with RPL.
