    "abstract_text": "Abstract 809 The activating JAK2V617F mutation is the most common mutation found in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), which include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Although a majority of MPN patients carry heterozygous JAK2V617F mutation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 9p involving JAK2 has been observed in \u223c30% of patients with MPNs particularly in PV and PMF. JAK2V617F homozygosity through 9pLOH has been linked to more severe MPN phenotype. However, the contribution of 9pLOH in the pathogenesis of MPNs remains unclear. To investigate the role of wild-type JAK2 in MPNs induced by JAK2V617F, we have utilized conditional Jak2 knock-out and Jak2V617F knock-in alleles and generated heterozygous, hemizygous and homozygous Jak2V617F mice. Whereas heterozygous Jak2V617F expression results in a polycythemia vera-like disease in mice, loss of wild-type Jak2 allele in hemizygous or homozygous Jak2V617F mice results in a significantly greater increase in reticulocytes, white blood cells, neutrophils and platelets in the peripheral blood and larger spleen size. We also have found that hemizygous or homozygous Jak2V617F expression significantly increased megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow and spleens and marked infiltration of neutrophils in the liver compared with heterozygous Jak2V617F. More importantly, hemizygous or homozygous Jak2V617F mice show accelerated myelofibrosis compared with heterozygous Jak2V617F-expressing mice. Thus, loss of wild type Jak2 allele increases myeloid cell expansion and enhances the severity of the MPN. Together, these results suggest that wild-type Jak2 serves as a negative regulator of MPN induced by Jak2V617F. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
