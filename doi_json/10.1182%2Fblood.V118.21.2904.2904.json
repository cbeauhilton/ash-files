    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2904 The secreted protein sonic hedgehog (SHH) and the hedgehog signaling are of great importance in proliferation and differentiation of cells in the hematopoietic system, and also play a vital role in oncogenesis of B cell malignance. However, the functions and mechanism of SHH signaling in multiple myeloma (MM) is mostly unknown. Thus far, aberrant activation of the hedgehog signaling in tumor growth promoting and/or survival capabilities as well as a paracrine model of SHH secretion have been demonstrated in MM. In the current study, we demonstrated a new autocrine SHH functioning manner in MM cells. The Shh mRNA and the SHH protein were highly expressed both in the MM cell lines and in purified CD138 + MM cells from patients using real-time PCR, Western Blot and immunohistochemistry analyses, respectively; and the SHH protein was also detected in the culture medium. Accordingly, the Hh ligand receptor PTCH1 and PTCH2 as well as the transcriptional factor GLI1 were all overexpressed in MM cells, indicating the activation of Hh signaling pathway. Autocrine SHH played a role in MM cells survival and protected MM cells from apoptosis in vitro, and autocrine SHH accelerated xenograft tumor growth in myeloma-SCID mouse model in vivo. Moreover, autocrine SHH enhanced drug resistance of MM cells, as SHH overexpressed CAG cells ( SHH+ CAG) had a significantly low apoptosis rate when treated with chemotherapy drugs dexamethasone or bortezomib, as compared with wild type cells (wt-CAG). On the contrary, SHH knockdown cells ( SHH- CAG) had a dramatically higher apoptosis rate. Blocking autocrine SHH ligand and treating cells with dexamethasone or bortezomib significantly improved the drug killing effect. Finally, we found that upregulated BLC2 via SHH-Gli1signaling is the signaling pathway by which MM cells enhanced the drug resistance. Our study provides a new insight into the biologic function of the autocrine SHH in proliferation, survival and the drug resistance in the myeloma cells.
