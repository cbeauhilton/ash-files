    "abstract_text": "The recurrence rate of thrombosis in children following a first thrombotic event ranges from 3% in neonates to 8% in older children. The relative importance of the factor II and factor FV mutations is unknown. We present a multicentre cohort study to assess the rate of symptomatic VTE recurrence per 1000 person-years in children heterozgous for the FII and FV mutations following a first VTE. Data were pooled to increase power for the secondary aims, e.g. time to recurrence, and predictors of recurrence. Between January 1994 and December 2006, 251 consecutively enrolled VTE patients aged newborn to \u226418 years (median 5.2 years: male n=141) carrying the FII (n=61) or FV mutation (n=190) were followed for a median of 58 (max 156) months. 128 of 251 VTE patients (51%) had at least one underlying medical condition at VTE onset, and 15 were heterozygous for both mutations. Children received acute anticoagulation (AC) with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular weight heparin, followed by AC with LMWH or warfarin for a three to 6 month period in 70% of cases. Of the 251 patients enrolled, 24 (9.5%: recurrence rate of 19.3 per 1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval (CI): 12.9\u201328.8) had recurrent VTE at a median (min-max) of 3.5 (0.1\u2013120) months. Not including combined defects, the recurrence rate per 1000 person-years was 41.4 (95%CI: 22.3\u201377) for patients with the FII mutation, and 14 (95%CI: 8.3\u201323.6) for carriers of the FV mutation. Median (min-max) age at recurrence was 13.4 (0.1\u201317) years, 12 of 24 patients were male (50%), and in 21 of 24 children (87.5%) recurrence occurred after withdrawal of AC. When comparing FII with FV subjects, Cox regression analysis showed that the factor II mutation (HR/95%CI: 2.5/1.1\u20135.9; p=0.031) was associated more frequently with a second VTE. In addition, older age (> 2 years) at first VTE onset (HR/95%CI: 1.1/1.01\u20131.14; p=0.025) independently influences the second VTE event [3.5 years (non-recurrence) vs. 12.7 years (recurrence); p< 0.0001]. Among patients suffering from recurrent VTE, 58% occurred within the first six months following VTE onset. Time to recurrence (FII vs. FII and age at onset >/< 2 ears) is shown in the Kaplan Meier analyses. The overall VTE recurrence rate of 9.5% is within the range recently reported in children. However, when comparing FII and FV carriers, the factor II G20210A variant is more often associated with a recurrent VTE. In addition, independently from the underlying gene mutation age > 2 years at first VTE increase the risk of a second symptomatic venous thrombosis.
