    "abstract_text": "Background: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is a rare, progressive, and fatal disease caused by the buildup of transthyretin-derived amyloid protein in major organs, predominantly affecting the peripheral nerves and heart. Inotersen, a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide targeting TTR mRNA, has shown efficacy and safety in patients with hATTR in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, NEURO-TTR (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01737398; Benson NEJM 2018). Patients with hATTR amyloidosis who completed the NEURO-TTR study were eligible to receive inotersen for up to 5 years in a phase 3 open-label extension study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02175004). Methods: In NEURO-TTR, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive inotersen (300-mg weekly subcutaneous doses) or placebo. In the open-label extension, patients continued inotersen (inotersen-inotersen) or switched from placebo to inotersen (placebo-inotersen). Evaluations included modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 neurophysiologic tests composite score (mNIS+7; higher scores indicate worse neuropathy), Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy questionnaire total score (Norfolk QoL-DN; higher scores indicate worse QoL), and adverse events (AEs). Cardiomyopathy (CM) was defined by a diagnosis of hATTR-CM at trial entry or by an interventricular wall thickness of 13 mm or more on transthoracic echocardiography at baseline, as ascertained by a central reader, or no known history of persistent hypertension (systolic blood pressure, \u2265150 mm Hg) within 12 months before screening. Results : In the placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 NEURO-TTR study, 112/172 patients were randomized and received inotersen. At baseline, patients were predominantly white (91.9%) males (68.6%) with a mean age of 59.2 years. A total of 67.4% had stage I (ambulatory) and 32.6% had stage II (ambulatory with assistance) disease. Inotersen-treated patients who had stage II disease had a longer duration of disease from diagnosis (40.9 vs 24.8 months, respectively) and from onset (72.6 vs 63.2 months, respectively) of hATTR polyneuropathy symptoms compared with placebo-treated patients who had stage II disease, indicating more advanced disease. A higher proportion of inotersen-treated patients had CM at baseline (67% vs 55%, respectively), and more severe CM, measured by higher NT-proBNP levels and longer duration of disease from hATTR-CM symptom onset, compared with placebo-treated patients. In the phase 3 open-label extension study as of Sept 15, 2017, 134 of 135 patients enrolled received \u22651 dose of inotersen. The mean age was 60.4 years and most patients were male (69.4%). Extended dosing with inotersen up to 27 months continued to improve mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN in the open-label extension compared to placebo-treated patients at week 66 in the double-blind NEURO-TTR study; mean changes from open-label extension baseline to open-label extension week 52 in the inotersen-inotersen group were 5.1 points for mNIS+7 (vs 25.5 for placebo-treated patients in the double-blind NEURO-TTR study) and 3.9 points for Norfolk QoL-DN (vs 10.7 for placebo-treated patients in the double-blind NEURO-TTR study). Initiation of inotersen in placebo-treated patients (placebo-inotersen) resulted in improvement in mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN by week 26. Few patients discontinued treatment because of AEs (inotersen-inotersen, 9%; placebo-inotersen, 4%). The rate of treatment-related serious AEs was low in both treatment groups (2% each). There was no evidence of increased risk for grade 4 thrombocytopenia or severe renal events with increased duration of exposure. We will present 2-year follow-up results from the open-label extension study. Conclusions: Results of the open-label extension show continued benefit, measured by mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN, and confirmed that earlier initiation of treatment is important for optimal clinical outcomes. No new safety concerns were identified. Results from the longer-term follow-up for the open-label extension will further elucidate how inotersen may benefit patients with hATTR amyloidosis.
