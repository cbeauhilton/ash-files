    "abstract_text": "Background: Axi-cel is a US FDA-approved autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for treatment of adult patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma after \u2265 2 prior lines of therapy. In ZUMA-1, the pivotal study of pts with refractory large B cell lymphoma, the objective response rate (ORR) was 82%, including a 58% complete response (CR) rate (Neepalu and Locke, et al. N Engl J Med. 2017). Grade \u2265 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events were observed in 12% and 31% of pts, respectively, and were generally reversible. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-1 and PD-L1, have been shown to be expressed on both CAR T cells and in the tumor microenvironment and subsequently upregulated after CAR T cell infusion (Vranic, et al. PLoS One . 2017; Cherkassky, et al. J Clin Invest . 2016; Galon, et al. ASCO 2017. #3025). This suggests that axi-cel activity could be augmented by incorporating PD-L1 blockade. This end of Phase 1 analysis of ZUMA-6 examines the safety and preliminary efficacy of axi-cel in combination with the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab (atezo) in pts with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL; NCT02926833). Methods: Eligible pts (\u2265 18 years) with refractory DLBCL, defined as stable or progressive disease to last line of therapy or relapse within 12 months after autologous stem cell transplant, must have recieved prior CD20-targeting and anthracycline-containing regimen and had ECOG \u2264 1 and adequate bone marrow and organ function. Pts received low-dose conditioning with fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 /day and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m 2 /day \u00d7 3 days followed by axi-cel infusion at a target dose of 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/kg. Atezo was administered at 1200 mg every 21 days for 4 doses starting on Day 21, 14, and 1 post-axi-cel infusion for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This report describes Phase 1 results from all 3 cohorts. Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included the frequency of adverse events (AEs), disease response, pharmacokinetics, and biomarkers. Results: As of January 19, 2018, 12 pts have received axi-cel and at least 1 dose of atezo (3 in Cohort 1; 3 in Cohort 2, 6 in Cohort 3). Median age was 55 years (range, 30 - 66). Most pts (9/12, 75%) had received \u2265 3 prior therapies, and 4 pts (33%) had an International Prognostic Index score of 3 or 4. The median follow-up from axi-cel infusion was 4.4 months (range, 0.8 - 12.6), with 50% of pts having \u2265 6 months of follow-up. Eight pts (67%) have received all 4 doses of atezo, and 11/12 pts have received all scheduled doses of atezo. One pt in Cohort 3 experienced a DLT of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia lasting longer than 30 days. All pts experienced at least 1 AE (92% Grade \u2265 3), with no apparent exacerbation or recurrence of axi-cel-related toxicity following atezo infusion. Only 1 Grade \u2265 3 AE was attributed solely to atezo. Overall, the most common grade \u2265 3 AEs were anemia (9/12, 75%), encephalopathy (5/12, 42%), and neutropenia (5/12, 42%). Grade \u2265 3 CRS and neurologic events occurred in 3 (25%) and 6 (50%) pts, respectively. The ORR in evaluable pts was 9/10 (90%), with 6 pts (60%) in CR and 3 (30%) in partial response (PR); 2/6 pts (33%) had converted to CR at month 6 and month 9 after initially achieving a PR. CAR T cell expansion as measured by area under the curve in the first 28 days (AUC 0-28 ) was over 2-fold higher in ZUMA-6 than the median observed in pts with DLBCL in ZUMA-1 (ZUMA-6: median, 823 cells/\u00b5L \u00d7 days, range, 99 - 2301; ZUMA-1: median, 357 cells/\u00b5L \u00d7 days, range, 5 - 11,507; Figure). Median CAR T cell levels remained higher than ZUMA-1 beyond 28 days. However, initial peak CAR T cell levels were similar (ZUMA-6: median, 68 cells/\u00b5L, range, 9 - 274; ZUMA-1: median, 32 cells/\u00b5L, range, 1 - 1513). Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) levels peaked within the first week after axi-cel infusion and reached a median of 730.5 pg/mL (range, 212 - 1876). The median peak IFN\u03b3 level in pts from ZUMA-6 was 1.5-fold higher than that from pts enrolled in Cohort 1 of ZUMA-1 (493.8 pg/mL, range, 32.4 - 1876). Conclusions: PD-L1 blockade with atezo following axi-cel infusion has a manageable safety profile, with a low incidence of DLTs and no clinically significant evidence of increased incidence of AEs. Encouraging efficacy results support the opening of Phase 2 of ZUMA-6 in which 22 pts will be treated according to the Cohort 3 schedule. Pharmacokinetic data suggest the potential for enhanced CAR T cell expansion. Figure. View large Download slide Figure.
