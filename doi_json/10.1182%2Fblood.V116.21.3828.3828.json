Minimal HRQOL data have been published on multiple myeloma (MM) patients (pts) in the United States (US). This analysis characterizes variation in the HRQOL of pts with active, symptomatic MM by International Staging System (ISS) stage and ECOG status. Methods: Data were collected as part of Connect MM\u00ae, a prospective observational registry initiated in September 2009 involving centers in the US. Data on pt demographics and clinical characteristics were provided by clinicians. HRQOL was reported by pts in the clinic at enrollment, within two months of diagnosis. Pts completed 3 psychometrically validated instruments: EQ-5D, Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Multiple Myeloma (FACT-MM). Standard analyses were conducted of each instrument given clinical characteristics at that time. Reported mean BPI, EQ-5D and FACT-MM scores were analyzed by ISS and ECOG status. Statistical significance of score differences among sub-cohorts was ascertained by ANOVA using SAS 9.1. Results: HRQOL data were reported by 328 pts, enrolled from 135 centers. Pts were predominantly male (60%) and white (79%) with mean age at 67.3 (standard deviation [SD] 11.6) yrs. HRQOL scores by evaluable ISS stage (n=236) and ECOG status (n=258) are presented. BPI data (on a scale of 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain]) indicate that average reported pain worsens by ISS and ECOG severity. Mean EQ-5D scores (on a scale of 1 [no problem] to 2 [some problems] to 3 [incapacity]) indicate that pain/discomfort, and usual activities are most compromised, and with self care increase in severity as ISS and ECOG worsen. Anxiety/depression level is associated with ECOG, but not with ISS. FACT-MM results indicate that ISS and ECOG severity is associated with greater decrement in physical and functional domains. The associations of HRQOL with ECOG status were stronger than with ISS stage. Specifically, scores on the BPI, all EQ-5D domains, and all FACT-MM domains (except the social/family domain) were statistically significantly associated with more severe ECOG status. Conclusions: Initial results from the Connect MM\u00ae Registry indicate that HRQOL worsens with worsening ISS stage and ECOG status, especially in physical and functioning domains, pain/discomfort, and ability to conduct usual activities and to provide self care. These areas should receive attention at diagnosis. Future analyses should be conducted on: (1) more newly diagnosed patients; (2) how HRQOL may be affected over time with changes in disease; and, (3) how HRQOL may be influenced by alternative therapies. Results reported here should serve as useful baseline reference.  Mean(SD) . ISS Stage . I (26%) . II (36%) . III (37%) . P value 1 .
