    "abstract_text": "To investigate the clinical impact of U2AF1 MT in MDS, we studied a cohort of 511 patients who were performed 112-targeted gene sequencing. We identified U2AF1 MT in 86 (17%) subjects, including U2AF1 S34F (64%, n=55), U2AF1 S34Y (23%, n=20), U2AF1 Q157R (6%, n=5), U2AF1 Q157P (5%, n=4) and U2AF1 R156H (2%, n=2). Compared to many MDS-related gene mutation, U2AF1 MT more frequently occurred in younger patients (Median age: 45 vs. 54 yrs; P=0.001). We performed multivariate analysis to characterize the associations between U2AF1 MT and other common gene mutations and cytogenetic abnormalities, SF3B1 MT (P=0.001, OR=0.214, 95%CI: 0.083-0.55) was inversely associated with U2AF1 MT subjects, while isolated +8 (P<0.001, OR=4.671, 95%CI: 2.510-8.689), KRAS MT (P=0.008, OR=3.521, 95%CI: 1.388-8.934), and ASXL1 MT (P=0.033, OR=2.003, 95%CI: 1.059-3.786) was significantly enriched in U2AF1 MT subjects. Using copy number-adjusted VAF, we reconstructed the clonal architecture of U2AF1 MT patients to establish whether a U2AF1 MT was an ancestral or subclonal mutation. 65 patients with 1 or more mutation, except for U2AF1 MT, were analyzed. U2AF1 MT was an ancestral mutation in 46 (71%) patients and was a subclonal mutation in 19 (29%) patients. In our cohort, U2AF1 MT was associated with worse overall survival (OS, P=0.01). Considering for different type of U2AF1 MT,  MDS patients with U2AF1 Q157/R156 MT tended to have a reduced median survival as opposed to patients with S34 (17 vs . 30 months, P=0.318). Then, we performed a comprehensive and systematic analysis to determine the impact of U2AF1 MT on pre-mRNA splicing in bone marrow mononuclear cells from 40 patients and 5 healthy controls. We identified 315 misregulated splicing events between patients with U2AF1 MT (n=20) and those without any spliceosome mutations (n=17) (Figure 1A). U2AF1 MT were associated with a higher proportion of exon skipping (SE, 68%), mutually exclusive exons (MXE, 19%) and alternative 3\u2032 splice site (A3SS, 8%) usage events (Figure 1B). Interestingly, only one gene (MRS2, Magnesium Transporter MRS2) with significantly dysregulated expression was observed from the aberrantly spliced genes. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed on the genes showing significant aberrant splicing events and the analysis showed a strong cluster of GOs associated with histone modification, RNA metabolism and cell cycle processing. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed DNA damage response pathway, including DNA Repair and p53 pathway as one of the major gene sets up regulated upon U2AF1 MT (Figure 2). Then, the single cell RNA-sequencing was performed in Lin-CD34+CD38-CD90+CD45RA- hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) from one sample with U2AF1 MT. After QC filtering, 5 HSC with U2AF1 MT and 47 HSC without any spliceosome mutations were used for aberrant splicing events analysis. Totally, 1752 misregulated splicing events were indentified (Figure 3A). Forty three genes with significantly dysregulated expression were observed from the aberrantly spliced genes, including 6 genes (TP53BP1, MDM2, PRC1, RAD51C, IP6K2, TMBIM6) taking part in DNA damage response (Figure 3B). In summary, this comprehensive study provides novel insights into U2AF1 MT MDS disease pathophysiology, with newly identified clinical associations, and dysregulated genes and pathways representing potential new therapeutic targets.
