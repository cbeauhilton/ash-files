    "abstract_text": "Background: The advent of B-cell-receptor associated kinase inhibition (BCR-KI) inaugurated a novel therapeutic principle in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). First-in-class Ibrutinib (Ib) and Idelalisib (Id) received marketing authorization from the EMA for the treatment of relapsed/refractory (r/r) CLL in 2012 and 2014, respectively. In spite of ample evidence from trials, real life data are scarce. Methods: Our clinical registry has been previously described in detail [https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-99-110618]. It comprises of 168 unselected CLL patients (pts.), who were observed between 10/2014 and 08/2020. 65 of them required treatment during this period: 39 x 1st line only and 26 x > 2nd line. 18 of these 26 r/r CLL pts were treated either with Ib (11 x) or Id (7 x). Treatment was started according to iwCLL guidelines. The type of BCR-KI was chosen based on an individual's performance status, previous treatment and co-morbidity. Median 1 st line-treatment (as a rule immunochemotherapy) started 27.5 months (m) after diagnosis (range: 0.5 m to 87.5 m). Time from 1 st line therapy to BCR-KI treatment (' Ctx effected time' ) was 13.0 to 128.1 m (median 50.5 m), in total (18 pts.) 1052.5 m, i.e. 87.7 years (y). 17 of 18 pts. had received Rituximab (R) as part of a pre-BCR-treatment protocol. Estimated charges per month are 9.000 \u20ac in Id + R, 7.000 \u20ac in R + chemotherapy (ctx, i.e. Fludara or Bendamustin mostly) and 4.500 \u20ac in Ib or Id mono or R + Chlorambucil (Clb) respectively. Results: Patients described herein differed according to age at start of BCR-KI (44.4 to 86.8 y, median 76.0 y), sex (10 m, 8 f), types and lines (1 to 6, median 2) of prior treatment. Indications for BCR-KI were increasing tumor burden (17 x, 1 x combined with pleural effusion) and persistent hemolysis (1 x). Genetic high risk features comprised of at least one of the following: IGHV unmutated status, mutation and/or deletion of TP53 gene, deletion of 11q, and complexe karyotype. These features were present in 17 of 18 pts. (median 3 features). In particular, unmutated IGHV was found in 13/18 r/r pts who received BCR-KI (total cohort of r/r pts, 21/26). Overall response rate was 78% (Ib 8/11; Id 6/7). Time to next therapy or death (` KI effected time` ) varies from 1.1 m to 69.1 m - in total 286.9 m until now. 4 pts. continued BCR-KI from 30 to 67 months. This was always the longest period of unchanged therapy in these 4 pts. Shorter ` KI effected time ` in the other 14 pts. was associated with higher treatment line and treatment interruptions. 2 responding pts. (without side effects) stopped BCR-KI and stayed in ongoing hematological remission for 11 and 25 months after cessation of treatment. Adverse drug reactions occurred in 6 pts. (Ib 4 x, Id 2 x). 5 pts. died on BCR-KI, but there was no therapy related death. Approximate costs per month in Germany are 1700 \u20ac in ` Ctx effected time ` (1.800.000 \u20ac per 1052,9 m) and 4.700 \u20ac in ` KI effected time ` (1.350.000 \u20ac per 286,9 m). Of note, one pt. on Id showed clinical progression associated with genetic evolution after 67 months of BCR-KI. He promptly responded to venetoclax. Discussion: In real live many r/r CLL pts. are elderly and present a broad spectrum of different clinical features. A clinical registry can reflect this and may add to our knowledge from multicenter studies. Remarkably almost all of our unselected r/r CLL pts. revealed genetic high risk features, in particular unmutated IGHV status, making them ideal candidates for targeted treatment strategies. These strategies take advantage of the fact that BCR-KI has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and effective in elderly and pre-treated pts. Undoubtedly BCR-KI increases the total costs of therapy, but affords a prolongation of overall survival. Remaining open questions include optimal treatment sequences, combination partners for BCR-KI as well as thorough analysis in the quality of molecular remissions.
