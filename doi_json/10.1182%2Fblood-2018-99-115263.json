    "abstract_text": "Pain is one of the most dreadful symptoms in sickle cell disease (SCD) and is often refractory to currently available analgesics. Besides acute painful vaso-occlusive crises, SCD is also accompanied by intractable chronic pain. This persistent, and often unrelieved, pain starts early in childhood and continues throughout life. The neurobiological mechanisms of chronic pain in SCD remain unclear, which markedly limits effective pain management and the quality of life in patients with SCD. Taking advantage of two humanized mouse models of SCD, this study aimed to investigate protein phosphorylation mechanisms for chronic pain in SCD. We characterized pain in two transgenic mice models of SCD that exclusively express human alleles encoding normal \u03b1- and sickle \u03b2-globin. Berkeley SCD mice (BERK mice) and Townes' SCD mice (TOW mice) exhibited ongoing spontaneous pain behavior and increased sensitivity to evoked pain stimuli compared with littermate control mice expressing normal human hemoglobins. To investigate the underlying protein phosphorylation mechanisms of chronic pain in SCD, we examined PKC isoform mediated nociceptive signaling. Prominent activation of multiple PKC isoforms were observed in the superficial laminae of the spinal cord dorsal horn in BERK and TOW mice. Functional inhibition and silencing of specific PKC isoforms attenuated spontaneous pain, mechanical allodynia, and heat hyperalgesia in both transgenic SCD mice. Furthermore, employing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation approach, we were able to generate a sickle cell anemia model in PKC-null mice, allowing us to specifically target neuronal PKC in SCD. Neither spontaneous pain nor evoked pain was detected in the mice lacking specific PKC isoform despite the full establishment of SCD phenotypes. In summary, this study is the first to identify the presence of ongoing spontaneous pain in preclinical sickle cell models, which closely mimic the most prevalent manifestation in patients with SCD. Moreover, we found that spinal PKC is a critical mechanism for the generation and maintenance of ongoing and evoked pain in SCD. These findings offer insights into sickle cell pain mechanisms, which may become a potential target for pharmacological interventions. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
