    "abstract_text": "Background. The IFM2009-02 study was launched in 2009, and randomized 84 patients (pts) with pomalidomide (oral 4 mg daily) and dexamethasone (oral 40 mg weekly) given either 21 days out of 28 or continuous. Whilst the overall median PFS was 4.6 months - this end stage very advanced RRMM population, we observed that 40% of the patients had a prolonged PFS and subsequently OS in the trial. We sought to analyze the characteristics of 58 pts that had more than 3 months of pomalidomide to study the effect of long exposure to Pomalidomide. Method. IFM 2009-02 was a multicentre phase 2 study of pts with RRMM who had at best a stable disease with the last course of bortezomib and of lenalidomide, or who were refractory to bortezomib and lenalidomide (IMWG). This analysis was performed on the ITT population combining data from the 2 study arms. We have analyzed the characteristics of pts according to duration of treatment with pomalidomide and dexamethasone 3 months to one year (<1 year) or more than one year (\u22651 year). Results. 60% and 40% of pts were exposed to pomalidomide for <1 year and \u22651 year, respectively. The ORR for the <1 year group was 43%, the median PFS 4.6 months (CI95% 4;6) with only 6% at 12 months, and the median OS 15 months (4;6) and 65% at 12 months, 40% at 18 months. For the \u22651 year group, the response rate and survival were strikingly different, ORR at 83%, PFS 20.7 months, OS not reached (CI95% 40;-) and 100% at 12 months, 91% at 18 months. Of the pts in the <1 year, 87% have died versus 35% in the \u22651 year group. Of note, death of most pts occurred during the follow up period post pomalidomide therapy , however in a far greater extent for the <1 year group, 96% versus 67%, that could suggest it was more difficult to salvage these pts post pomalidomide. We next sought to identify the characteristics of the 2 groups. Interestingly, the median number of prior lines was similar across groups, 5 (range 1-10), with 89% and 79% of the pts exposed to more than 3 lines and 17% and 22% exposed to more than 6 lines, for the <1 year and \u22651 year groups, respectively. 40% and 48% of pts had Bortezomib as last line, 29% and 43% Lenalidomide, 43% and 26% and alkylating agent. Similarly, 80% and 74% of pts were refractory to Bortezomib, 89% versus 87% to Lenalidomide, 65% versus 75% to alkylating agents, 74% and 87% to the last line of therapy, respectively. 74% and 70% were double refractory (Bortezomib and Lenalidomide) and 60% and 70% were triple refractory (double +last line), respectively. The time from diagnosis to IFM 2009-02 study entry was also similar between cohorts, 5.8 and 6.5 years for <1 year and \u22651 year groups; however with 6% versus 26% of pts, entering the study in less than 3 years since diagnosis. There was no difference in terms of patients characteristics between groups, either patients-based such as gender, age, weight, or myeloma-based characteristics. However, serum beta 2m level was higher at diagnosis in the <1 year compared to the \u22651 year, 54% versus 35%, with a slightly more adverse cytogenetic profile 35% versus 12%, with the limitation that this was not available for all the patients. Presence of plasmacytoma/EMD was also greater in the former group, 20% versus 4%, respectively. It seems that the <1 year had more intrinsic adverse features of the tumor cells compared to the \u22651 year group. There was no clear difference in terms of safety management of pomalidomide and/or dexamethasone, with respect to the daily dose intensity of Pomalidomide (median, 3.0 and 2.9 mg/day), and the relative dose intensity of pomalidomide that was 89% and 84%, respectively; similar to the rate of dose reduction and dose interruption. Conclusion. Pomalidomide and dexamethasone is effective and well tolerated in these heavily pre-treated MM pts refractory to Bortezomib and Lenalidomide, with approximately 40% of the patients having a prolonged exposure to treatment, which translated into a significantly prolonged OS. Our study suggests that patients with more intrinsic adverse features of Myeloma tumor cells could not have prolonged exposure to pomalidomide as they progressed within a year from start of pomalidomide. Future studies should examine optimizing pomalidomide therapy in those patients, such as using multidrug pomalidomide-based combined regimens to prolong exposure to pomalidomide and improve the survival of these patients.
