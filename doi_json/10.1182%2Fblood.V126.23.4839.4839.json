    "abstract_text": "Background: The proteasome is an established and druggable target for the treatment of plasma cell-related malignancies including Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM). WM cells as a consequence of high immunoglobulin production and increased B-cell receptor (BCR) mediated proliferation upregulate proteasome activity. Additionally, microenvironmental influence mediated through BCR signaling directly influences Bcl-2 and its BH3 family members, supporting tumor cell survival. Indeed, WM patients derive significant clinical benefit from proteasome-inhibitor (PI) based therapy with agents such as bortezomib and carfilzomib. However, resistance to PI develops over time and for these patients the optimal choice and sequence of therapy has yet to be determined. Using our WM models of PI-resistance we interrogated molecular events within the BCR and Bcl-2 pathways to determine therapeutic potential of targeting these crucial pathway in PI-resistance. Materials & Methods: WM cell lines (BCWM.1 and MWCL-1) and carfilzomib-resistant (CR) subclones (BCWM.1/CR and MWCL-1/CR) were used in experiments. Gene-expression and long-noncoding (LNC) RNA analysis was performed (Arraystar) and validated by real-time PCR. Bortezomib, carfilzomib, ABT199 and ibrutinib were purchased from Sellekchem. Results: To determine the functional impact of BCR and Bcl-2 signaling in PI-resistance, as well as therapeutic sensitivity of PI-resistant cells to their inhibitors (ibrutinib, ABT-199, respectively), we established and characterized WM cell lines resistant to carfilzomib. BCWM.1/CR cells showed approximately 20-fold resistance to carfilzomib (IC50 = 92.75nM) and MWCL-1/CR cells approximately 10-fold resistance (Fig. 1A). Both CR clones also displayed some cross-resistance to bortezomib. Gene expression and LNC-RNA profiling demonstrated several changes between carfilzomib-resistant vs. sensitive WM cells. Analysis of proteasome-related mRNA revealed downregulation of PSMB5, PSMB1, PSMB2 and PSMB8. Similarly, profiling of BCR-associated genes demonstrated decreased expression of several components, including BTK and SPI1. This observation functionally manifested as reduced sensitivity to the BTK-inhibitor ibrutinib, wherein CR cells displayed 1.5 - 2 fold growth resistance to ibrutinib on 72hr MTS assay. Next we examined the expression of Bcl-2 family members in CR cells. Intriguingly, we observed that Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 were significantly downregulated but XIAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) was significantly increased in CR cells vs. wildtype WM cells- both at transcriptional and translational levels. This suggested that upon acquisition of CR, a transcriptional shift towards XIAP occurs to accommodate sustained therapeutic stress from carfilzomib and maintain steady antiapoptotic composure. To test if the PI-resistant cells have moved away from their survival dependence on Bcl-2, we treated CR cells to increasing concentrations of the Bcl-2-specific inhibitor, ABT199, and as anticipated, CR cells displayed reduced apoptosis in presence of ABT199 compared to wildtype WM cells (32% annexin-V staining vs. 50%, respectively) (Fig. 1B). Conclusions: Our study sheds insight into the differential drivers of PI-resistance particularly towards carfilzomib, in WM cells. We demonstrate that acquisition of CR is associated with downregulation of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, which is countered by upregulation of XIAP- an event that renders CR cells resistant to ABT199 (as it targets only Bcl-2). Likewise, downregulation of BCR-related components in CR cells was associated with reduced sensitivity towards ibrutinib. These observations suggest that acquisition of resistance to PI such as carfilzomib can impact future treatment with agents such as ibrutinib or ABT199. Our preclinical models provide rationale or early sequencing of ibrutinib or ABT199 in therapeutic planning of WM patients prior to induction of PI resistance. Figure 1.
