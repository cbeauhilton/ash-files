    "abstract_text": "Busulfan, an important agent used in conditioning regimens before hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation, has a \u201cnarrow\u201d therapeutic index. Targeted dosing of busulfan based on its pharmacokinetic (PK) profile is often used. We studied the age-dependent PK profile of single daily dose intravenous Bu (IV Bu) in pediatric patients and determined a target range of Bu exposure that is appropriate for children undergoing reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) HSPC transplantation. The RIC regimen included: fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 per day for 6 days (days \u201310 to \u20135); single daily treatment doses of IV Bu given over 3 hours each day for 2 days (days \u20135 and \u20134), with individualized Bu dosing based on the PK results of a test dose; and rabbit ATG (2 mg/kg/day) or equine ATG (40 mg/kg/day) for 4 days (days \u20134, \u20133, \u20132 and \u20131). In 2 variations of the regimen, ATG was either eliminated or replaced with extracorporal photopheresis. Allogeneic HSPC were infused on day 0. Cyclosporin A and mycophenolate mofetil were used for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. An initial cohort of 52 patients was studied. The median age of the cohort was 7.7 years (range 0.06\u201317.6), with 19 patients less than 4 years of age (group 1) and 33 patients older than 4 years (group 2). Patients had either malignant or non-malignant diseases (immunodeficiency (n=14), metabolic disease (2), marrow failure (6), histiocytosis (1), ALL (9), AML (5), CML (4), MDS (2), lymphoma (5)), neuroblastoma (4)). Patients received a test dose of IV Bu (0.8 mg/kg) five days before the treatment doses. After the test dose, the median AUC attained was 886 \u03bcM\u00b7min in group 1 (range 439\u20131828) and 965 \u03bcM\u00b7min in group 2 (range 579\u20131970). Only 59% of the patients in both groups attained a plasma concentration-time \u201carea-under-the-curve\u201d (AUC) within the expected range of 800\u20131200 \u03bcM\u00b7min. Based on the test dose PK, patients received individualized treatment doses adjusted to target an AUC of 4000 \u03bcM\u00b7min per day for 2 days (range 3200\u20134800 \u03bcM\u00b7min). The median daily treatment dose of IV Bu given was 3.45 mg/kg in group 1 (range 0.8\u20137.2) and 3.20 mg/kg in group 2 (range 0.9\u20135.4), with a distinct and linear inverse-relationship between the weight-normalized treatment dose required and the weight of the patient (treatment dose = 4.0 mg/kg - 0.01*weight in kg, p=0.001). After the adjusted treatment dose, patients who achieved AUC within the targeted range increased to 67% in group 1 and 84% in group 2. Despite the dose adjustment, group 1 attained a lower median treatment dose AUC (3568 \u03bcM\u00b7min) as compared to group 2 (4035 \u03bcM\u00b7min) (p=0.001). All patients in this cohort tolerated the conditioning regimen. No patient developed seizures or hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Stable donor chimerism, however, was achieved in only 56% of patients in group 1 and 79% in group 2. Eight patients received a second transplantation because of primary or secondary graft failure. Eight patients died of transplantation-related causes. Because of the concern that a low AUC correlated with an adverse clinical outcome, a second cohort of 23 patients followed a modified protocol in which a treatment dose AUC of 5000 \u03bcM\u00b7min was targeted (range 4200\u20135800 \u03bcM\u00b7min). The median age of the second cohort was 2.1 years (range 0.3\u201321), with 13 patients less than 4 years and 10 patients older than 4 years. The median daily treatment dose given in this cohort was 4.5 mg/kg (range 2.6\u20136.5). All patients tolerated the higher Bu treatment dose with minimal regimen-related toxicity. After the treatment dose, patients attained a higher median AUC of 4825 \u03bcM\u00b7min (range 3719\u20135900), with over 90% of the patients achieving AUC within the targeted range of 4200\u20135800 \u03bcM\u00b7min. The number of patients who achieved stable donor chimerism also increased to 91%. One patient died of a transplantation-related cause. In conclusion, our results showed that RIC regimens utilizing 2 single daily doses of IV Bu were effective and well tolerated in children. An age-dependent variability in the PK profile of IV Bu could have contributed to a higher rate of graft failure in the younger patients after they received the Bu doses targeted to achieve an AUC of 4000 \u03bcM\u00b7min per day. Since there appears to be a wide safety margin in the upper limit of the Bu therapeutic range in RIC transplantation, a targeted AUC of 5000 \u03bcM\u00b7min per day for two days is recommended in pediatric patients, especially those less than 4 years of age.",
