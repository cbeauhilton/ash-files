    "abstract_text": "The expression of the catalytic enzyme of tryptophan, indoleamine 2,3-dyoxigenase (IDO) in different cellular subsets, including solid tumors, has been recently identified as a T-cell inhibitory effector pathway. Here, we show that unlikely normal hematopoietic CD34 + cells expressing IDO only upon stimulation with IFN-\u03b3, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells constitutively express IDO and inhibit allogeneic T-cell proliferation. IDO expression correlates with increased CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T cells in AML patients at diagnosis. In vitro, IDO + AML cells increase the percentage and the absolute number of CD4 + CD25 bright T cells, also expressing surface CTLA-4 and Foxp3 mRNA. The addition of the IDO-inhibitor, 1-methyl tryptophan (1-MT), completely abrogates such increase. Purified CD4 + CD25 + T cells obtained from coculture with IDO + AML cells are not proliferating and unable to produce IL-2. They also inhibit naive T-cell proliferation and Th1 skewing. Co-culture with IDO + AML cells results in the conversion of CD4 + CD25 \u2212 into CD4 + CD25 + T cells and the addition of 1-MT completely abrogates this effect. In mice, intrasplenic injection of IDO-expressing leukemia/lymphoma A20 cells induces the increase of CD4 + CD25 + T cells, which can be blocked by 1-MT treatment. These data suggest that AML cells have the capacity to directly increase a population of T regulatory cells through the constitutive expression of the functionally active form of IDO. IDO expression can be regarded as a novel mechanism of leukemia escape from immune control and its inhibition may represent a novel anti-leukemia therapeutic strategy."
