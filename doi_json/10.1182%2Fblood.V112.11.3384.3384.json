    "abstract_text": "Background : In von Willebrand disease type 2B (VWD2B) the abnormal VWF spontaneously binds to circulating platelets, usually resulting into loss of high molecular weight multimers (HMWM) and thrombocytopenia. In these patients VWF:RCo/Ag ratio is indicative of reduced HMWM and roughly correlated with the severity of VWD2B defect. Physiological concentrations of Chloride ions (Cl \u2212 ) inhibit the hydrolysis of VWF by ADAMTS-13. Cl \u2212 acts as an allosteric effector and its specific binding to VWF A1 domain results into a reduced availability of A2 to be proteolised by ADAMTS-13. Type 2B VWF R1306W showed a reduced affinity to Cl \u2212 (>K d Cl \u2212 ) and an increased (>kcat/Km) susceptibility to proteolysis by ADAMTS13 (De Cristofaro, R. et al Molecular mapping of the chloride-binding site in VWF. J Biol Chem  2007 ; 281 : 30400 \u201311 ). Aim : To determine if other VWD2B mutations affect Cl \u2013 binding by changing the proteolysis of mutant VWF by ADAMTS-13. Methods : Five distinct mutant recombinant (r)A1-A2-A3 proteins (Table), have been prepared along with the WT. Determination of K d Cl \u2212 of each rA1- A2-A3 was achieved by intrinsic protein fluorescence, performed as a function of both Cl \u2212 concentrations and temperature. Study on the kinetic rates of hydrolysis of each rA1- A2-A3 by ADAMTS-13 was evaluated using HPLC methods. Results and Conclusions : The results (Table) confirmed that affinity of Cl \u2212 (K d Cl \u2212 ) was decreased in all mutant rA1-A2-A3s compared to the WT at different extent, with an inverse correlation to the catalytic specificity (kcat/Km) of ADAMTS-13 interaction. Higher VWF:RCo/Ag ratios were found associated with lower values of kcat/Km in our studied patients. This finding strongly support that the reduced affinity of type 2B VWF to Cl \u2212 might contribute to the depletion of HMWM.  Table (patients) . WT --- . R1341Q (4) . R1341W (3) . H1268D (1) .
