    "abstract_text": "We evaluated the outcomes in 194 consecutive patients (pts) transplanted with UCB after a myeloablative therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML,n=86), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL,n=89), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML,n=13), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS,n=6) between 1995 and 2007. Methods: Pts were assigned to 3 treatment groups (Table 1): Cy 120mg/kg, TBI 1320 cGy and equine anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) 90mg/kg with one UCB unit (CyTBI, 1995\u20132000; n=65; median age 9 yrs, r 0.5\u201352); CyTBI and Flu 75mg/m2/day with one UCB unit (CYFluTBI-1, 2000\u20132007; n=36; median age 8yrs, r 2\u201344); and Cy/Flu/TBI with two UCB units (CyFluTBI-2, 2001\u20132007; n=93; median age 25yrs, r 9\u201345). All received cyclosporine A (CsA) with either short course methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/days; days +5 to +19) or mycophenolate mofetil (days -3 to +30). Pts were classified as standard (acute leukemia in CR1-2 or CML in first chronic phase, n=138) or high risk (n=56) for relapse. Median follow-up for survivors is 2.8 years (r: 0.7\u20139.2). Pts received a 0\u20131 HLA-mismatched graft in 81% for CyFluTBI-1, 47% for CyTBI, and 36% for CyFluTBI-2 (p<.01). The total nucleated cell dose infused in recipients of CyFluTBI-1 was 3.6 (2.1\u201313.9), CyTBI 3.0 (0.9\u201314.0), and CyFluTBI-2 3.6 (1.7\u20136.5) x 10 7 /kg (p=.01). Results: Engraftment was not significantly different for the 3 groups (CyFluTBI-1 97% (92\u2013100) vs. CyTBI 89% (82\u201396) vs. CyFluTBI-2 87% (80\u201394) (p=.06). Patients receiving a total CD34+ cell dose > 2.5 x 10 6 /kg had significantly better engraftment (6.5, 98% [94\u2013100], p<.01). Incidence of grades II-IV GVHD was higher after CyFluTBI-2 (51% [40\u201362]) as compared to CyFluTBI-1 (25% [11\u201339]) or CyTBI 37% (25\u201349) (p<.01) in univariate, but not in multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and disease risk. While treatment-related mortality (TRM) at 2 yrs was similar in univariate analysis (CyFluTBI-1, 11% [1\u201321] vs. CyFluTBI\u20132, 32% [22\u201342] vs. CyTBI 32% [22\u201342], p=.07), after adjusting for age and disease risk TRM was higher for the CyTBI (RR 3.5 [1.1\u20139.2], p=.03) vs. CyFluTBI-1. The relapse risk at 4 yrs for CyFluTBI-1 was 37% (19\u201355), CyFluTBI-2 19% (10\u201328), and CyTBI 28% (18\u201338) (p=.19). The LFS at 4 yrs for CyFluTBI-1 was 52% (34\u201370), CyFluTBI-2 49% (38\u201360), and CyTBI 37% (25\u201349) (p=.46). In multivariate analysis, only high risk disease was associated with higher relapse risk (RR 2.0;95%CI,1.0\u20133.9;p=.05) and mortality (RR 2.2;95%CI,1.4\u20133.4;p<.01). Notably, cell dose and HLA match had no effect on any outcome in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Use of two partially HLA matched UCB units has increased the applicability of UCB particularly in adult recipients. As a result all UCB grafts contain >2.5 x 10 7 nucleated cells/kg at cryopreservation, limiting the negative effect of low cell dose on engraftment and survival and reducing the negative impact of HLA mismatch previously reported.",
