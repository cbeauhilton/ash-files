    "abstract_text": "Chemokine receptor CXCR4 is critically involved in the migration of hematopoietic cells to the stromal derived factor (SDF-1\u03b1)-producing bone marrow microenvironment. We and others have previously demonstrated that stroma/leukemia interactions mediate protection of leukemic cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis ( Konopleva, Leukemia  2002 : 1713 ; Burger Blood  2000 : 2655 ). Using AMD3465, the second-generation small-molecule CXCR4 inhibitor with a greater potency than AMD3100, we tested the hypothesis that CXCR4 inhibition interferes with stromal/leukemia cell interactions resulting in increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. Our results showed that AMD3465 inhibited surface expression of CXCR4 on AML cell lines in a dose dependent manner. AMD3465 (1\u03bcM) significantly inhibited SDF-1\u03b1 and stromal (MS-5)-induced migration of OCI-AML2 cells (78% and 54% inhibition, respectively), U937 cells (71% and 41.3%) and diminished SDF-1\u03b1- or stromal-induced migration of leukemic blasts from four primary AML samples tested (SDF-1\u03b1, 43.4 \u00b1 8.6%, MS-5, 38.4 \u00b1 8.5% inhibition). In in vitro co-culture systems, stromal cells significantly protected leukemic cell lines and primary AML cells from spontaneous and chemotherapy induced apoptosis (p<0.01; p<0.001). Measurements of intracellular Ara-CTP levels determined by HPLC showed that stromal cells diminished incorporation of Ara-C into leukemic cells by 20%. AMD3465 enhanced AraC- and Busulfan-induced apoptosis by 44% and 69%, respectively. Western blot revealed that AMD3465 downregulated AKT signaling in AML cells. Most importantly, it decreased stroma-mediated protection from AraC-induced apoptosis in five out of ten primary AML samples with surface expression of functional CXCR4 (mean increase, 29.9\u00b119.5% compared to chemotherapy alone). Curiously, the highest sensitization was observed in a sample from AML patient harboring Flt3/ITD mutation (Ara-C, 30.3% annexinV(+); Ara-C+AMD, 62.8%), confirming recently documented role for Flt3/ITD in modulation of CXCR4 signaling ( Fukuda, Blood  2005 : 3117 ). Taken together, our data suggest that SDF-1\u03b1/ CXCR4 interactions contribute to the resistance of leukemic cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Disruption of these interactions by the potent CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3465 represents a novel strategy for targeting leukemia cell/bone marrow microenvironment interactions. A clinical trial testing this concept in patients with AML is in preparation.",
