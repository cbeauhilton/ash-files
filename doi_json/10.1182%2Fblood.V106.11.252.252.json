    "abstract_text": "Background: Primary systemic amyloidosis (AL) is an incurable plasma cell disorder. For selected patients high dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell support is effective, but even in those patients, only 50% derive organ responses. Other patients are too sick to undergo that therapy. Thalidomide has limited utility in this disease, largely because of its toxicity profile in patients with AL. Lenalidomide, Celgene\u2019s lead clinical compound in a new group of drugs called IMiDs\u00ae, is highly active in patients with multiple myeloma, especially in conjunction with dexamethasone. We sought to determine the toxicity and efficacy of lenalidomide in patients with AL. Methods: Patients with symptomatic AL who had a measurable plasma cell disorder (defined as serum M-spike \u2265 g/dL urine M-spike >200 mg/24 hours; or involved immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) \u226510 mg/dL and an abnormal FLC ratio) and adequate organ reserve defined as a creatinine \u22643 mg/dL, absolute neutrophil count \u22651000, platelet count \u226575000, and a hemoglobin \u22658 g/dL were eligible. Patients were started on lenalidomide 25 mg/day for 21 days followed by a 7 day rest (1 cycle). Dose modifications were made based on toxicity. If there was evidence of progression before 3 months or no evidence of hematologic response after 3 cycles, dexamethasone 40 mg p.o. days 1\u20134 and 15\u201318 was added. Results: Twenty-three patients were enrolled between 10/28/04 and 4/7/05; 14 were previously treated. Patient characteristics are shown in Table. Organ involvement was as follows: cardiac (61%); renal (70%), hepatic (22%); nerve (13%). Nine patients withdrew from study before completing 3 months of therapy. The reasons were: cancel (1); death (4); adverse events (2); and progression (2). At the time of our preliminary analysis in July 2005, an additional 3 patients have withdrawn from study: death (1) and patient refusal (2). Of the 5 patients who died, 4 had severe cardiac involvement and at least 3 organs involved by amyloid. The median follow-up for the eleven patients remaining on study is 6.2 months. Of the 12 patients who have crossed the 3 month treatment landmark, there are 7 hematologic partial responses (4 confirmed and 3 unconfirmed), two renal responses and one liver response. Of these same 12 patients, all but one has had dexamethasone added to their treatment program. The most common grade 3\u20134 adverse advents at least possibly attributable to lenalidomide were neutropenia (43%), thrombocytopenia (26%), rash (17%), dyspnea (9%), fatigue (9%), and edema (4%). Expansion of the trial is planned to accrue an additional 10 evaluable patients. Conclusions: Early results suggest that lenalidomide \u00b1 dexamethasone has activity in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis.
