    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3566 Primary systemic T-cell lymphoma of anaplastic large cell type (ALCL) is an aggressive and predominantly nodal subtype of lymphoma, further subdivided based on expression of the ALK-protein, with ALK-pos ALCL occurring predominantly in younger patients and associated with a favourable prognosis. ALK-neg ALCL is believed to carry a prognosis similar to that of other nodal peripheral T-cell lymphomas and previous studies have shown long-term survival rates below 50%. There is retrospective data suggesting a benefit from ASCT in first-line treatment of this lymphoma subtype. We analyzed the outcome of ALK-neg ALCL patients included in a prospective phase II trial, NLG-T-01, conducted by the Nordic Lymphoma Group. The NLG T-01 trial enrolled 160 patients aged 18\u201367 years from the Nordic countries with systemic ALK-neg peripheral T-cell lymphoma within the period 2002\u20132007. The treatment schedule consisted of 6 courses of CHOEP-14 followed by ASCT (BEAM or BEAC) in responding patients. Patients >60 years received CHOP-14 as induction. Altogether, the trial included 31 patients with ALK-neg ALCL (19% of the study population). Median age was 56 years (22-65) with a male:female ratio of 2.4. Stage III-IV was found in 18 patients (58%), B-symptoms in 19 patients (61%) and 6 patients (19%) had a bulky lesion (>10cm). Pre-therapeutic serum lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in 18 patients (58%) and performance score was 2\u20134 in 10 patients (32%). After 3 and 6 courses of chemotherapy, response status was CR or CRu in 29% and 58% of the patients, respectively. In total, 24 out of 31 patients (77%) underwent BEAM/BEAC therapy followed by ASCT. Four patients did not respond or had disease progression during induction chemotherapy. The remaining 3 patients did not undergo ASCT for other reasons (mobilization failure, lung insufficiency, patient decision, respectively). Overall response rate after ASCT was 74% for the entire initial population and 96% for those undergoing ASCT. Median follow-up was 45 months. Six patients relapsed after ASCT. There was a total of nine deaths (29%): six due to lymphoma, two due to toxicity and one from second malignancy (colon cancer). With a median follow-up of 45 months, 3-year overall and progression-free survival values were 73% and 64%, respectively. Intensive chemotherapy followed by ASCT was feasible in the majority of the patients included in this prospective trial. Long-term outcome appears promising when compared to previously published data, with the survival curve suggesting a plateau. In ASCT eligible patients, intensive induction chemotherapy consolidated by upfront ASCT is an effective treatment that yields outcome results at least as good as those obtained in age-comparable patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
