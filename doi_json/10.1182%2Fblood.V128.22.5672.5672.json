    "abstract_text": "Post-translational modifications of the histone proteins play a key role in regulating processes that require access to DNA. Specifically, methylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27) is intimately linked with transcriptional repression. EZH2, a histone lysine methyl transferase is the catalytic component of the PRC2 complex, which catalyzes H3K27 methylation. EZH2 dysregulation has been observed in different malignancies and inhibition of its catalytic activity has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach to treat human cancers. Potent, selective and reversible EZH2 small molecule inhibitors are currently being tested in Ph. 1 clinical trials. We and others have reported EZH2 dependencies across non-Hodgkin Lymphoma subtypes in cancer cell lines, in xenograft mouse models and in lymphoma patients. We identified Multiple Myeloma as potential clinical application for EZH2 inhibitors. Treatment with EZH2 inhibitors such as CPI-360, CPI-169 and CPI-1205 cause apoptosis in multiple myeloma and plasmacytoma cell models and causes tumor growth inhibition in myeloma xenograft models at well tolerated doses. An EZH2-controlled transcriptional signature across various multiple myeloma was identified using integrated RNA-sequencing and ChIP-sequencing data. Combination studies testing EZH2 inhibitors with standard of care (SOC) agents across a panel of multiple myeloma cell lines showed synergistic responses with several of the SOC agents in vitro and in vivo.
