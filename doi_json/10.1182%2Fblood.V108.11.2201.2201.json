    "abstract_text": "Imatinib mesylate (IM, STI571, Gleevec\u00ae) is highly effective in the treatment of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In patients with residual disease or relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), the optimal strategy is a matter of debate: donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) alone, IM alone or a combination of both have been administered to CML patients in this clinical situation. As an impairment of anti-viral CD8+ T lymphocyte function by IM has been described, we questioned whether IM also affects specific anti-leukemic CD8+ T lymphocytes. Moreover, we asked to which extent CD4+CD25 hi T regulatory cells might be affected by IM thus changing the balance between cytotoxic and tolerogenic T cells. After mixed lymphocyte peptide culture (MLPC), we assessed CD8+ T cells from healthy donors and patients with CML after allo-SCT by tetramer staining/multi-color flow cytometry and enzyme linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays, as well as CD4+CD25 hi cells after 3 days of culture with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. The release of interferon gamma and granzyme B by CD8+ T lymphocytes specific for R3 (ILSLELMKL), a T cell epitope peptide derived from the leukemia-associated antigen designated RHAMM/CD168 (receptor for hyaluronic acid mediated motility) was inhibited by IM in a clearly dose-dependent fashion in a range from 1 to 25 \u03bcM. These T cells were further characterized as CD8+ HLA-A2/R3_tetramer+ WT1_tetra-CD45RA+CD27-CD28-CCR7- effector T cells with the ability to lyse R3 peptide labeled T2 cells and CD34+ CML progenitor cells. The inhibition of CD8+ T lymphocytes was a function of the time of exposure to IM and reversible after removal of IM from the MLPC. On the other hand, the proliferation and function of CD4+CD25 hi FoxP3+GITR+TGF\u00df1+ CD69+CD152+ T regulatory cells were also significantly inhibited by IM in a dose-related fashion. These findings suggest that the clinical impact IM must not necessarily result in a reduced efficacy of the graft-versus-leukemia effect observed after allo-SCT and/or DLIs but might depend rather on the ratio of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and CD4+CD25 hi T regulatory cells.",
