    "abstract_text": "The hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have the ability to self-renew and to give rise to all blood lineages. These processes occur via a hierarchy of progenitors with progressively more limited differentiation and self-renewal potential and are orchestrated by specialized protein such as transcription factors. LYL-1 protein contains a basic helix-loop-helix DNA binding motif also found in several proteins involved in the control of cellular proliferation and differentiation such as SCL/TAL-1. As LYL-1 shares an 80% homology at the protein level with SCL/TAL-1, we wanted to determine the function of LYL-1 in hematopoiesis and particularly on HSC. For this study, we used knock in lyl-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice in which exon 4 was replaced by LacZ/Neo cassette. Lyl \u2212/\u2212 mice are viable and have normal blood cell counts as well as a normal marrow cellularity. In addition, using a hematopoietic colony forming cells (CFCs) assay, no significant difference was seen in the myeloid CFCs of either lyl-1 \u2212/\u2212 or lyl-1 +/+ BM and FL cells except a 2-fold increase in the absolute number of BFU-E in lyl-1 \u2212/\u2212 FL as compared to lyl-1 +/+ FL. We analyzed more primitive progenitors in details because using Fluorecein Di-beta Galactopyranoside (FDG)-staining assay, we showed that lyl-1 is mainly expressed in primitive Lin \u2212 Sca-1 + c-Kit + cells (LSK) cells from either BM or FL (91 \u00b1 7% and 78 \u00b1 5% of FDG positive cells in lyl-1 \u2212/\u2212 BM and FL LSK cells, respectively). In addition, analysis of lyl-1 \u2212/\u2212 and lyl-1 +/+ cells revealed a 1.8-fold and 2-fold decrease in the percentage of primitive LSK in BM and FL, respectively, as compared to wild type cells. Furthermore, using the Hoechst 33342 efflux assay, we noticed a significant decrease in the absolute number of more primitive LSK-SP (side population) cells in lyl-1 \u2212/\u2212 BM as compared to lyl-1 +/+ BM cells (52800 \u00b1 5412 cells/femur versus 91080 \u00b1 8475 cells/femur, respectively) suggesting an important role of LYL-1 in the HSC function. In order to confirm this hypothesis, in vivo assays were performed. We observed a 1.5-fold decrease in the lyl-1 \u2212/\u2212 BM and FL day 12 CFU-S content as compared to lyl-1 +/+ cells. Adoptive transfer experiments were subsequently performed using lethally irradiated Ly5.1 mice. Data showed that lyl-1 \u2212/\u2212 cells from either BM or FL displayed a hematopoietic reconstitution defect in competitive repopulation assays. Indeed, Ly5.1 recipients were injected with a mixture of 5x10 6 (5:1), 10 6 (1:1) or 0.5x10 6 (0.5:1) lyl-1 \u2212/\u2212 or lyl-1 +/+ Ly5.2 expressing cells and 10 6 competitive BM Ly5.1 expressing cells. All hosts engrafted with lyl-1 \u2212/\u2212 BM cells shown a significant reduced levels of chimerism (% of circulating Ly5.2 + cells) as compared to hosts engrafted with lyl-1 +/+ BM donors (4.3 \u00b1 2.8% (5:1); 7.5 \u00b1 5.5% (1:1); 0.6 \u00b1 0.3% (0.5:1) in lyl-1 \u2212/\u2212 BM cells versus 66 \u00b1 8% (5:1); 52 \u00b1 9% (1:1); 53 \u00b1 10% (0.5:1) in lyl-1 +/+ BM cells) and similar difference was observed with FL donors (45 \u00b1 2% (5:1); 25 \u00b1 5% (1:1); 11 \u00b1 5% (0.5:1) in lyl-1 \u2212/\u2212 FL cells versus 83 \u00b1 1% (5:1); 70 \u00b1 3% (1:1); 53 \u00b1 6% (0.5:1) in lyl-1 +/+ FL cells). This altered defect in HSC was also confirmed using LTC-IC in vitro experiments. Altogether, our results demonstrate an important role of the transcription factor LYL-1 on the maintenance of HSC properties.",
