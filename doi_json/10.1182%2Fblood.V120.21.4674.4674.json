    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4674 Background\u2014Treatment and prevention of relapse and recurrence after HSCT is challenging. DLI from the same donor is an effective therapeutic clinical option for patients. Method\u2014we retrospectively analyzed the data of 14 patients with diagnoses included ALL (n=3), AML(n=3), thalassemia (n=7), aplastic anemia(n=1), who received DLI after HSCT. We analyzed the relationship between the during of DLI to the occurrence of aGVHD. Results\u2014A total of 25 infusions were given to 14 patients with a median infusion time of 116(44\u2013620) days post-HSCT. acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade I occurred in 9 patients at a median day of 33.4(14\u201370) after DLI. GVHD prophylaxis (using CsA) reduced the incidence of aGVHD. Our data showed that the median time to DLI in patients with aGVHD was 206 (44\u2013521) days, and aGVHD developed in about 50% of the patients receiving DLI less than 180 day post-transplantation, while GVHD occurred in 33.3% of the patients who received DLI over 180 day (p=). the risk of developing GVHD was also dependent on the dose of DLI, with 7 patients developing GVHD when the dose of infused cells is 1\u00a1A\u0301107 lymphocyte cells/kg however, ? patients. Conclusion\u2014the response to DLI is dependent on the time post-transplant. It seems that it is more easy to develop GVHD to DLI less than 180 days post-transplantation and to receive a dose of 1\u00a1A\u0301107 lymphocyte cells/kg. GVHD would possibly occur in 4 weeks after DLI. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
