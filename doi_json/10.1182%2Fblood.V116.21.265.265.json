    "abstract_text": "Abstract 265 Erythrocyte hydration status and endothelial cell activation have been proposed as important contributors to vaso-occlusion and impaired blood flow in the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD). However, the physiological mechanism(s) that mediate the interplay between erythrocytes hydration status and the endothelium in SCD are unclear. We have recently reported a role for dual endothelin-1 receptor antagonists in improving sickle erythrocyte hydration status and K + transport in vivo via modulation of Gardos channel activity (Rivera A., 2008, Amer J Physiol). The Gardos channel is an important contributor to sickle erythrocyte dehydration that maybe modulated by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). PDI in leukocytes has been reported to catalyze disulfide interchange reactions, mediate redox modifications and has been observed to be up-regulated under hypoxic conditions. We report the detection of PDI by western blot analyses in membranes from both human and mouse sickle erythrocytes. We observed greater levels of cell surface associated PDI in sickle vs Hb A-containing erythrocytes. We also quantified PDI activity and observed a significant correlation between Gardos channel activity and cell surface associated PDI activity in human sickle erythrocytes and Hb A-containing cells (n=40, r 2 =0.3046, p=0.0002). In fact, closer examination revealed that sickle erythrocyte membranes had higher PDI activity than Hb A-containing erythrocyte membranes (5.07\u00b10.4 vs 1.30\u00b10.1%, n=22 and 18, respectively p<0.0001). Similar results were observed in membrane preparations of erythrocytes isolated from the BERK sickle transgenic mouse model when compared with wild-type controls. Consistent with a functional role for PDI in Gardos channel activation, we also observed that sickle erythrocytes incubated in cycles of oxygenation/de-oxygenation for 3 hr in the presence of PDI antibodies were associated with reduced sickle dense cell formation. Similar results were observed with bacitracin, another PDI inhibitor. We then treated BERK mice with dual ET-1 receptor antagonists (BQ123/BQ788) for 14 days and measured erythrocyte surface associated PDI activity. We observed that as with Gardos channel activity, cell surface associated PDI activity was significantly reduced following treatment with BQ123/BQ788 (8.80\u00b10.5 to 6.4\u00b10.6%, n=3 P<0.02). These changes were associated with an increase in erythrocyte MCV (31.3\u00b11.63 to 40.4\u00b10.35 fL, n=3, p<0.002) and a decrease in MCHC (40.4\u00b10.8 to 27.4\u00b13 g/dL, n=3, p<0.003). We then studied the direct effects of ET-1 on the human endothelial cell line, EA.hy926 (EA), as well as in primary cultures of BERK mouse aortic endothelial cells (BMAEC). Using quantitative RT-PCR with Taqman chemistries and GAPDH and beta-actin as endogenous controls, we observed that stimulation of EA cells with 100nM ET-1 for 4 hr was associated with increased mRNA expression of PDI levels that was 1.89 fold greater than vehicle treated cells (n=6, P<0.04). Similar results were observed on PDI mRNA expression in BMAEC isolated and cultured for 10 days then incubated with 100 nM ET-1 for 4 hr. Thus, our results strongly implicate cell surface associated PDI in cellular hydration status and its regulation by ET-1. We posit that aberrant regulation of PDI activity and/or its expression and secretion from either erythrocytes or endothelial cells represent a novel target aimed at ameliorating the complications associated with the pathophysiology of Sickle Cell Disease.
