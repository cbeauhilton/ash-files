    "abstract_text": "Background : CC-122, a pleiotropic pathway modifier, modulates the cullin 4 ring E3 ligase complex, which results in recruitment and degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros. This substrate degradation results in cell autonomous anti-lymphoma and immunomodulatory effects on T- and NK-cell function (Gandhi, ASH 2012). The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, obinutuzumab, improves direct cell killing and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity compared to rituximab (M\u00f6ssner, 2010; Niederfellner, 2011). The combination of obinutuzumab with CC-122 revealed synergistic effects in follicular lymphoma (FL) and additive effects in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in in vivo models when compared to either as single agents (Hsiling Chiu, ASH 2015). CC-122 monotherapy has shown encouraging activity against DLBCL and FL in a Phase I clinical trial (Rasco, ASH 2013). Obinutuzumab has demonstrated efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) (Salles, 2013) and DLBCL (Morschhauser, 2013) and has been approved by the FDA and the European Medicinal Agency for patients with previously treated FL. The current study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of escalating doses of CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL and iNHL (NCT02417285). Methods: Subjects with relapsed/refractory DLBCL and iNHL (FL and marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]) were enrolled in this phase 1b study of CC-122 given orally on 5 out of 7 days per week (5/7 days) for 28 day cycles. Subjects were enrolled in cohorts of escalating dose levels of CC-122 (1.0 mg [n=4], 2.0 mg [n = 4], 3.0 mg [n = 7], 4.0 mg [n = 6]), with a fixed dose of obinutuzumab. Obinutuzumab is administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 1000 mg on Days 2, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 8. The initial 4 dose levels evaluated active ingredient in capsule (AIC) CC-122 formulation. In Cohort 5 (3.0 mg, [n = 5]), subjects received CC-122 formulated capsules. Prophylaxis with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was not allowed during Cycle 1. As the study is ongoing, the CC-122 dose will be escalated until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established on the CC-122 formulated capsule, using a modified 3+3 design. Subjects are evaluated for efficacy every 2 cycles(c) through c6 then every 3 cycles through c12, then every 6 cycles. Results: As of 1 June 2016, 26 subjects with relapsed/refractory DLBCL or iNHL were enrolled; all were evaluable for safety. The median age was 60 years and 84.6% were male. Thirteen subjects had DLBCL (50%), 13 (50%) had iNHL (12 FL [46.2%], 1 had MZL [3.8%]). All subjects were ECOG 0-1. One subject experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of Grade 4 neutropenia (Cohort 3) and no dose was considered a non-tolerated dose (NTD). The most common (\u2265 10%) study drug-related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were neutropenia (50%), thrombocytopenia (30.8%), diarrhea, chills, and increased ALT (11.5% each). Seventeen subjects (65.4%) experienced at least one NCI CTCAE grade 3-4 TEAE related to study treatment (most common [\u2265 10%] were neutropenia [42.3%], thrombocytopenia [15.4%], and increased ALT [11.5%]). Seven subjects experienced at least one serious AE suspected to be related to study treatment by the investigator (infusion related reaction [3 subjects], febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and pneumonia, [1 subject each]). The overall response rate (ORR) for the 26 subjects enrolled, as of the efficacy cut off of 7 July 2016, was 53.8% (14/26); 8 of 12 (66.7%) FL, 5/13 (38.5%) DLBCL, and 1/1 MZL. Responses are ongoing in 12 of 14 of these subjects. ORR in the pooled higher dose cohorts of CC-122 (eg, a dose of 3 mg or higher, cohorts 3, 4, and 5) was 66.7% (12 of 18 subjects). Conclusion: The combination of CC-122 and obinutuzumab was well-tolerated in subjects with relapsed-refractory DLBCL and iNHL. AEs observed were consistent with the toxicity profile of CC-122 or obinutuzumab. Response rates observed were promising in this heavily pretreated population. Response rate appears higher in patients with FL however this warrants further investigation in a larger population. An NTD has not been reached and the MTD has not yet been established.
