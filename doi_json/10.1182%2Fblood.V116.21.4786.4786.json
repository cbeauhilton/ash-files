    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4786 Background: Mounting evidence that leukemia stem cells (LSCs) occupy and receive important signals from specialized areas (\u201cniches\u201d) that alter the stromal microenvironment and disrupt normal hematopoiesis. The innovative therapeutic strategies focus on targeting of microenvironmental interactions in leukemia. Therefore, it is important to fully elaborate the mechanisms of microenvironment- mediated leukemogenesis. Stromal-cell derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1a\u0300) is the main cytokine produced by bone marrow stromal cells. The SDF-1a\u0300/CXCR4 axis specifically mediates homing and migration of leukemic blasts. While our previous work has shown that SDF-1a\u0300 significantly increases hERG1 K + tail current and a specific hERG1 K + channels inhibitor significantly blocks SDF-1a\u0300- induced migration of leukemic cells. In fact, recent studies suggested that the human ether a\u0300-go-go-related gene (HERG) K + channels are constitutively expressed in AML stem/progenitor cells, and regulate cell proliferation as well as clinical prognosis. Here we investigate the hypothesis that a new leukemic blast\u2013stromal interaction is mediate by hERG1 K + channels and SDF-1a\u0300. Methods: Proliferation assay, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis were used to analyze effects of E-4031(a specific hERG1 K + channels inhibitor) in the presence of SDF-1a\u0300 on leukemia cell lines HL-60. RT\u2013PCR and western blot analysis were used to determine changes in herg1 expression and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in response to SDF-1a\u0300 in the presence and absence of E-4031. Primary leukemias obtained from the bone marrow of de novo AML patients (n=6) at diagnosis. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the samples using Ficoll-Paque density gradient separation, and cultured with SDF-1a\u0300 in the presence and absence of E-4031. AML colony-forming cell (CFC) assays and flow cytometry were performed to assess the effects of E-4031 in the presence of SDF-1a\u0300 on LSCs. Results: SDF-1a enhanced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal increase by 1.6 times was obtained for 100ng/ml. While this effect was impaired by E-4031, which significantly impaired cell proliferation induced by SDF-1a with a concentration of 100ng/mL by (40.3\u00b18.4)%. In addition, E-4031 inhibited SDF-1a-stimulated leukemic cell proliferation by inducing G0/G1 arrest. Cell apoptosis analysis revealed that either E-4031 or SDF-1a has direct effect on HL-60 cell apoptosis. Unexpected, there was no significant synergistic effect upon apoptosis. After exposures to 100ng/ml SDF-1a\u0300, hERG1 mRNA and protein levels increased significantly, by approximately 1.5-fold above control levels. Moreover, SDF-1a increased the expression of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin target genes, including \u03b2-catenin, cyclin-D1, and c-myc. Interestingly, this manner was abolished by E-4031. The presence of progenitor cells was evaluated by plating suspension cells cultured with SDF-1a in CFC assays. E-4031 decreased numbers of CFC in suspension to 77.3%. Upon expansion with SDF-1a, E-4031 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of progenitors to 31.8%. The effects on LSCs were determined on phenotypically described stem cells from AML. Treatment with 1\u03bc M E-4031 for 48 hours inhibited the proliferation of LCSs compared with untreated controls, a mean viability of 11.8% for CD34 + CD38 - and 10.4% for CD34 + CD38 + . In contrast, a significant decrease in the viability of stem cells after E-4031 in the present of SDF-1a treatment, with only 9.6% for CD34 + CD38 - and 9.5% for CD34 + CD38 + . Conclusions: Initial studies provided evidence that the hERG1 K + channels and SDF-1 emerged as mediators of stromal/leukemic cell interactions, which largely contribute to the proliferation mediated by the microenvironment. Likewise, other components of bone marrow microenvironment, such as Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, may modulate hERG1 K + channels in leukemic cells. Taken together, these results provided rationale for studies of new molecular events involved in bone marrow microenvironment and leukemogenesis.
