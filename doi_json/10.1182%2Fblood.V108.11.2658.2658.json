    "abstract_text": "Vidaza and Thalidomide were administered to 29 patients with MDS or AML. Vidaza was given at a dose of 75mg/kg subq X 5 days q28 days and Thalidomide starting at 50mg/day and increasing to 100mg. Therapy was well tolerated. Median age was 70 years, and there were 16 males. Two patients had RA, 2 RARS, 9 RAEB, 4 CMMoL, 10 AML and 2 Unknowns. According to IPSS, 1 had low, 7 had Int-1, 5 had Int-2 and 4 had high risk disease, and 2 unclassified and 10 had AML. Eleven patients had normal, 14 abnormal and 4 unknown cytogenetics. Hematologic improvement (HI) was seen in 14 and stable disease in 6 while 5 had disease progression. cDNA from pre-therapy BM mononuclear cells of 28/29 patients was hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133AA microarrays and data was analyzed using the GenePattern software package. Marker genes were selected using ClassNeighbors algorithm with the signal-to-noise metric. When comparing resistant disease (RD) patients with HI (6) and others (2), of the 40 top marker genes over-expressed in the RD group, 21 are directly associated with cellular proliferation and can be divided into 3 groups. Group I (cell cycle) consisted of 9 genes; BUB1B, CCNA2, TMPO, CDC2, CCNB1, UBE2C, TTK, CDC20 and MCM5. Group II (replication repair) had 5 genes; TOP2A, RRM2, RFC3, FEN1, RNAH2A. Group III (spindle/chromosome structure) had 7; KIF2C, NUSAP1, CENPF, MK167, SPAG5, CENPA and STK6. Over-expression of these genes would indicate rapid cellular proliferation which may be an underlying cause of drug resistance. These results are especially striking since the treatment regimen consisted of a combination of two drugs, Vidaza and thalidomide, which purportedly act through different mechanisms. We conclude that the RD patients share a molecular signature which is also consistent with a demonstrated mechanism of cell cycle resistance, and underscores the future clinical usefulness of this methodology."
