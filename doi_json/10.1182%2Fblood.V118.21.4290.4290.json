CAG regimen (cytarabine, aclarubicin, G-CSF) has been commonly used in China and Japan for the treatment of elderly AML pts. The aim of this study is to summarize the data and to analyze the efficacy as well as the toxic effects of CAG regimen in elderly AML pts. Methods: The databases of PubMed, Wanfang Data, as well as American Society of Hematology ( ASH ) annual meeting abstracts were searched for articles published in English, Chinese and Japanese languages from January 1995 to December 2010. Eligible studies were relevant clinical trials of elderly AML pts treated with CAG regimen. Complete remission (CR) rate, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of chemotherapy were compared through a meta-analysis using a random-effects or fixed-effects model. Results: 19 trials with a total of 367 elderly AML pts were identified and included for analysis. Among the 367 AML pts treated with CAG, 266 pts were newly diagnosed AML, 54 pts were relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML. The AML status was not specified in the rest 47 pts. The CR rate for the 367 elderly AML pts was 52.0% (95% CI 46.8%-57.2%). Interestingly, no significant difference in CR rates was noted between the newly diagnosed (54.7%, 95% CI 48.6%-60.7%) and R/R AML pts (45.7%, 95% CI 32.4%-59.6%) (Q=1.332, p=0.248). Three studies compared the CR rates of elderly AML pts according to the karyotype. The CR rate was significantly higher in pts with intermediate (72.4%, 95% CI 58.0%-83.3%) cytogenetics than those with unfavorable one (35.7%, 95% CI 18.7%-57.2%) (Q=7.803, p=0.005). These elderly AML pts tolerated CAG well with low cardiotoxicity (0.73%, 2/273) and ED (8.48%, 29/342). Conclusions: CAG regimen induced high CR rates in elderly pts with new and relapsed/ refractory AML. This regimen was well tolerated with low cardiotoxicity and early death rate. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
