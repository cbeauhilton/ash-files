    "abstract_text": "Introduction : About one third of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) fail frontline treatment or have early relapse. Baseline quantitative parameters derived from positron emission computed tomography (PET/CT) at baseline may predict outcome in DLBCL patients. However, their prognostic value in interim scans is unclear. Recently, the role delta maximum standardized uptake value (\u0394SUVmax) has been tested as a predictor of PFS. In this retrospective study we aimed to analyze the role of \u0394SUVmax between baseline and interim PET-CT as a predictor of progression of disease within 1 year in DLBCL patients and, to compare this parameter to the standard validated method to evaluate disease response: Deauville scale (DS). Methods : This is a single-center retrospective cohort study from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. We included patients with DLBCL who had baseline (b-PET) and interim (i-PET, after 2-3 cycles of treatment) PET-CTs and who have been treated with 6 cycles of R-CHOP given every 21 days. All PET-CTs were analyzed by the same physician and blinded for the clinical features. Delta maximum standardized uptake value (\u0394SUVmax) was calculated by the difference in % between initial PET SUVmax and iPET SUVmax. The objective was to assess if \u0394SUV performed better than Deauville scale (DS) in predicting early disease progression. Cut-off values were defined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Analysis was performed with Cox model. Model comparison was based on the lowest AIC. Results : A total of 83 patients with DLBCL were available for analyses. The median age was 60 years and 66% of patients had a germinal center B-Cell (GCB) phenotype. With median follow-up of 15 months, patients with a cut-off \u0394SUVmax 3 in the iPET were also at a higher risk of disease progression (p<0.001) (figure 2). The model with \u0394SUVmax was better adjusted (AIC=86) than the one with DS (AIC=92). The median maximum uptake at baseline PET/CT, MYC and/or BCl2 expression were not predictive of relapse at 12 months. International prognostic index (IPI) was also predictive of relapse (p=0.003), but again performed poorer than \u0394SUVmax (AIC=99). Discussion/Conclusion : We showed that \u0394SUVmax quantitative PET-CT model has superior discriminatory power than the qualitative DS model and the clinical IPI. Although we have a small sample, this finding corresponds with PETAL trial, which also showed that the \u0394SUVmax method is superior to the commonly used Deauville five-point scale to identify patients at high risk of treatment fails. Although, the \u0394SUVmax cut-off value calculated in our study was 85%, while in the PETAL study a reduction off 66% in the baseline SUV was the considered cutoff. Maybe, combing \u0394SUVmax method in a with DS and IPI can improve prognostic stratification and early identification of high risk DLBCL. The \u0394SUVmax is an easily reproducible method, that can be easily assessed by PET-CT, differing from other quantitative measures like the total metabolic tumor volume. In conclusion, further validation in a large sample of patients should be performed before the incorporation of quantitative PET-CT methods in clinical practice however it is a promising prognostic marker.
