    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: \u03b2 thalassemia is one of the most common single gene disorders. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor is a curative option that minimizes the risk of graft-versus-host disease, compared to alternative donor HCT. In families that have an affected child, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) can be utilized to select an unaffected embryo that is HLA-identical. Briefly, this procedure requires in vitro fertilization, oocyte retrieval, fertilization and blastomere biopsy for preimplantation analysis and identification of unaffected HLA-identical embryos. After delivery, umbilical cord blood from the sibling donor is collected for HCT. In our institution, PGD has been pursued as a therapeutic option by families with thalassemia. The estimated cost of this uninsured procedure is $20,000 per cycle. METHODS: Families affected with \u03b2 thalassemia who attempted PGD were identified and reviewed for indication, attempted cycles, successful pregnancy and transplantation outcome. RESULTS: Eight identified families affected by thalassemia underwent PGD. The diagnosis of their affected children included: 6 cases of \u03b2 thalassemia major and 2 cases of transfusion dependent E \u03b2 thalassemia patients. A total of 14 cycles of PGD were attempted, ranging from 1\u20134 attempts per family. Following successful identification of HLA-identical cells, 2 pregnancies occurred (1 early miscarriage, 1 successful delivery). This pregnancy resulted in the engraftment of a \u03b2 thalassemia child. CONCLUSION: PGD including selection of HLA-identical sibling embryos is a novel, therapeutic approach for patients with \u03b2 thalassemia. While this offers the possibility of recruiting a suitable donor for HCT, it is limited by significant financial and emotional burdens that it places on families affected with \u03b2 thalassemia. Improvements in its efficiency and cost will make this a more viable option for affected families.",
