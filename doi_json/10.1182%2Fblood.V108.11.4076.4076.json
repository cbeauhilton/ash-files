    "abstract_text": "The safety, efficacy, and optimal dosing of a von Willebrand Factor/Factor VIII concentrate (Humate-P \u00ae ) were evaluated in an open-label, uncontrolled study in patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD) undergoing elective surgery. During an initial pharmacokinetic (PK) phase, a detailed profile of FVIII:C, VWF:RCo, and VWF:AG was obtained for each patient after an infusion of 60 IU VWF:RCo/kg as Humate-P. Individual PK values were used to calculate subsequent loading and maintenance doses. Hemostatic efficacy was characterized using a 4-point scale (excellent, good, moderate/poor, or none) at several time points following surgery. Forty-two adults and children were enrolled in the study (17 VWD type 1; 6 type 2; 13 type 3; 6 type 2M), and 35 of these patients underwent a surgical procedure (classified as 3 oral, 7 minor, and 25 major). The median loading dose administered was 55.6 IU/kg (range 17.4 to 135.3 IU/kg). For patients with more severe VWD (baseline VWF:RCo<12 IU/dL), the median loading dose administered was 70.9 IU/kg (range 38.6 to 135.3 IU/kg). The dosing interval was 8 or 12 hours in most subjects (4 were dosed every 6 hours), and treatment duration ranged from 1 to 6 days depending on surgery type. Effective hemostasis (investigator- rated as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d) was noted in 91.4% (32/35) of subjects immediately after surgery, 100% (35/35) of subjects 14 days after surgery, and 100% (34/34) of subjects evaluated 24 hours after the last infusion (primary endpoint). Mean blood loss was less than expected, and four patients required transfusions, related to their surgery. Only six adverse events were considered possibly treatment related: headache (3), itching, nausea, and dizziness (1). These results demonstrate that von Willebrand Factor/Factor VIII concentrate is safe and effective in the prevention of excessive bleeding during and after elective surgery in adult and pediatric patients with von Willebrand disease."
