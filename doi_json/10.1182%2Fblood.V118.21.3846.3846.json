    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3846 INTRODUCTION There is strong evidence indicating that the clear-cut separation of prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (PMF) from essential thrombocythemia (ET) by consequent application of the World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 criteria is reflected in different, well defined clinical pictures and divergent prognoses (Barbui et al, JCO 2011,Thiele et al, Blood 2011). Very recently the specific risk profile for arterial and venous thrombosis in WHO- diagnosed ET was published (Carobbio et al, Blood 2011). In PMF so far all published data on vascular events were exclusively based on overt disease manifestations until now there are no data available regarding prefibrotic stages. Consequently, we aimed to evaluate the corresponding risk profile of patients with WHO-diagnosed prefibrotic PMF. METHODS A total number of 264 patients with WHO-defined prefibrotic PMF derived from either the Medical University of Vienna or an International Database (Barbui et al, JCO 2011) were studied. Nonfatal thrombotic events considered in this study were reported as rates per 100 patient-years and included transient ischemic attacks, thrombotic cerebrovascular accidents, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, deep vein thrombosis of peripheral vasculature, pulmonary embolism, and abdominal large vein thrombosis. Cardiovascular risks factors considered, comprised of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and tobacco use. To evaluate risk factors for total thrombosis and for arterial and venous events in particular multivariate Cox- regression analysis including the co-variables sex, age, previous thrombotic event, laboratory parameters measured at diagnosis and need for cytoreductive and/or antiplatelet therapy during follow-up was calculated. P values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. RESULTS After a median follow- up of 5.8 years (range0.0 \u2013 27.2), the total rate of non fatal thrombotic events was 2.1% patient-years (95% CI, 1.5\u20132.8); the incidence of arterial events was higher (1.7% patient- years) than of venous events (0.6% patient-years).Considering thrombosis in general a higher white blood cell (WBC) count enhances the risk significantly (p=0.005; HR 1.15). This is also true in arterial events in particular (p=0.047; HR 1.12). A lower platelet count is associated with a higher risk for thrombotic events; for thrombosis in general this association is of borderline significance (p=0.056; HR 0.99), for arterial thrombosis in particular of significance (p= 0.042; HR 0.99). A lower hemoglobin level is associated with a higher risk for venous thrombosis (p=0.007; HR 0.59). CONCLUSION Leukocytosis appears as a risk factor for thrombosis in general and also for arterial thrombosis in particular in WHO-diagnosed prefibrotic PMF. Moreover, higher platelet counts seem to decrease significantly the risk for thrombotic events in general and arterial thrombosis in particular. Anemia is associated with a higher risk for venous thrombosis. These observations are partly in line with recently published findings in WHO-diagnosed ET (Carobbio et al,2011) and might indicate the existence of a specific risk profile for thrombotic events in prefibrotic PMF. This is the first study reporting data on the risk profile for thrombosis in WHO-diagnosed prefibrotic PMF. Certainly these findings ask for validation in a larger patient population.
