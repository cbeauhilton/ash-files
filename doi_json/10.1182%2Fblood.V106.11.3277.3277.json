    "abstract_text": "Background: Expression of ZAP-70 is associated with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes and poor prognosis in B-cell CLL. Reliable clinical flow cytometric assays have been difficult to establish, as many anti-ZAP-70 antibodies show a suboptimal signal-to-noise ratio, and an imperfect correlation with IgV H mutation status. Methods: We studied fresh peripheral blood or bone marrow specimens from forty-three patients with CLL/SLL. Samples were stained for intracytoplasmic ZAP-70 using a standard monoclonal antibody, 1E7.2/PE (Caltag, Burlingame, CA), and the novel monoclonal antibody J13\u20131164/PE (kindly provided by BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Threshholds were set using isotype-matched negative control antibodies. Mutational status of the IgV H genes was assessed by RT-PCR, followed by standard Sanger DNA sequencing. Divergence from germline IgV H segments (IMGT database) was calculated using VBASE, with 2% or less changes over codons 1\u201394 of IgV H regarded as unmutated. Results: Staining with J13\u20131164 revealed a clear apparent cutpoint in levels of positivity, with 26/43 (60%) of the CLL cases showing >49% of cells above the isotype threshhold. Most of the remaining cases (15/43, 35%) showed 20% positive cells (the cutpoint suggested by Rassenti et al., N Engl J Med 2004, 351:893). However, staining with 1E7.2 was more difficult to interpret, as many cases had levels of positivity that were close to the cutpoint, with 15/43 (35%) showing 10\u201330% of cells positive. Both antibodies showed similar degrees of correlation with IgV H mutation status, with 72\u201375% of unmutated cases showing the expected positivity for ZAP-70, and 57\u201364% of mutated cases negative for ZAP-70 (see Table 1). The two antibodies yielded concordant results in about half of cases (21/43), and the concordant cases showed a strong correlation with IgV H mutation status: 15/16 cases positive with both antibodies had unmutated genes, and 4/5 cases negative with both antibodies had mutated genes (see Table 2). The cases with discordant staining between the two antibodies were a mixture of cases with mutated or unmutated IgV H genes. Conclusions: The J13\u20131164 anti-ZAP-70 antibody provides more easily interpretable results in routine clinical use than the 1E7.2 clone, with brighter staining in many cases and a more distinct difference between positive and negative cases in our series. Compared to the 1E7.2 clone, the J13\u20131164 clone shows a similar degree of correlation with the IgV H mutation status. A combination of both antibodies provides the strongest correlation with IgV H mutation status, with 19/21 concordant cases showing the expected staining pattern.
