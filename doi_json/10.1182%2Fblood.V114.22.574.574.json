    "abstract_text": "Abstract 574 Background. Elevated tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) as determined by echocardiography correlates with elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in adults with sickle cell disease. The importance of elevated TRV in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease is not known. The Pulmonary Hypertension and the Hypoxic Response in SCD (PUSH) study is an ongoing, longitudinal and observational multicenter study of children with sickle cell disease. Methods. Baseline echocardiography and six-minute walk test were performed prospectively in 361 children and adolescents with sickle cell disease at steady state and then repeat studies were performed in 209 after a median of 22 months of follow up (range 10 months to 36 months), also at steady state. A hemolytic component was derived by principal component analysis of baseline values for reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin. Results. TRV or six-minute walk test were measured at both baseline and follow-up in 193 patients. Twenty-one of these 193 patients had elevated TRV of 2.60 m/sec or higher at baseline. Elevated baseline TRV was associated with high hemolytic rate in 15 patients, defined as hemolytic component above the median for the population studied, and with lower hemolytic rate in six patients. Elevated baseline TRV with high hemolytic rate predicted elevated TRV at follow up (odds ratio 7.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.5 to 24.2; P <0.001) but elevated baseline TRV with lower hemolytic rate did not (odds ratio 1.6; 95% CI 0.2 to 14.1; P = 0.7). Elevated baseline TRV with high hemolytic rate also predicted a decline in the six-minute walk distance by 10% or more at follow-up (hazard ratio 3.9; 95% CI 1.4 to 10.7; P = 0.009). In contrast, higher cardiac output as measured by the left ventricular end diastolic dimension z-score was associated with reduced risk for a decline in the walk distance (hazard ratio 0.7; 95%CI 0.6 to 0.9; P = 0.006). Conclusion. Steady-state TRV elevation in association with a high hemolytic rate occurs on screening in about 8% of children and adolescents with sickle cell disease and is predictive of elevated TRV and reduced six-minute walk distance after approximately two years of follow. Such children may be at risk for adverse clinical consequences of pulmonary hypertension as young adults. Further studies are indicated to identify the molecular mechanisms and to develop appropriate medical management for children and adolescents with this complication.
