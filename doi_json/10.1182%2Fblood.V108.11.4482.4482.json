    "abstract_text": "Regeneration of the T-cell population proceeds normally along two different pathways, in which the thymic-dependent pathway accounts for the more durable reconstitution of the T-cell compartment, and generates a more diverse TCR repertoire. Thus thymus function serves as a direct index to understand cellular immune function and potential of long-term TCR V\u03b2 repertoire reconstitution. The complexity of TCR repertoire is generated in the thymus by regular recombination of series of gene fragments of TCR \u03b1 or \u03b2 chains. During these process, by-products of rearrangements are generated in the form of signal joint T-cell receptor excision DNA circles(sjTRECs), as sjTRECs are stable extrachromosomal annular DNA, are not replicated while cell dividing, and their existence suggests functional TCR generation. Thus thymic function can be evaluated by measuring sjTRECs in peripheral blood. At present, the total recent thymic output function is evaluated by quantitating \u03b4Rec-\u03c8J\u03b1 sjTRECs, but it can not evaluate particular thymic emigrants of different V\u03b1 or V\u03b2 subfamily nai\u0308ve T cells. As TCR V\u03b1 and V\u03b2 nai\u0308ve T cells include many subfamilies which play different immune roles, and the complexity of TCR repertoire is an important factor for cellular immune reconstitution. Our previous studies had showed that the recent thymic output function in patients with AML was significant decrease by quantitative detection of \u03b4Rec-\u03c8J\u03b1 sjTRECs. To further estimate the recent thymic emigrants of different TCR V\u03b2 subfamily nai\u0308ve T cells, this study was designed to detect the existence of 23 TCR V\u03b2 subfamily sjTRECs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by using 23 V\u03b2 subfamily special primers (including 2D\u03b21 sense primers and 23 V\u03b2 subfamily antisense primers). TCR 23 V\u03b2-D\u03b2 1 sjTRECs were separately amplified in genomic DNA from 5\u00d710 4 and 1\u00d710 4 PBMCs of samples (10 cases of normal individuals and 32 cases of the different FAB subtypes of AML patients) to estimate the frequencies of TCR 23 V\u03b2-D\u03b21 sjTRECs by using semi-nest PCR. The results indicated that the frequencies of 23 V\u03b2-D\u03b21 sjTRECs were different at the same cellular concentration, and the higher cellular concentration the higher frequency of V\u03b2 subfamily sjTRECs. The number of detectable V\u03b2 subfamily sjTRECs was (5.09\u00b13.28) and (2.59\u00b12.06) in 5\u00d710 4 and 1\u00d710 4 PBMCs from AML patients, as compared with (13.7\u00b12.67) and (5.50\u00b12.07) from normal individuals, and the differences were significant (both p =0.000). About 5/23(22%) of V\u03b2-D\u03b21 sjTRECs were detected in 5\u00d710 4 PBMCs from AML patients, and the frequencies of 13 V\u03b2 subfamily sjTRECs (including V\u03b21,V\u03b2\u03b2,V\u03b23,V\u03b24,V\u03b25, V\u03b29,V\u03b210,V\u03b212,V\u03b213,V\u03b214,V\u03b217,V\u03b222,V\u03b224-D\u03b21 sjTRECs) were significantly lower than those from normal individuals, among which the lowest were V\u03b210 and V\u03b214-D\u03b21 sjTRECs, the most frequency was V\u03b221. But the difference was not significant within the different FAB subtypes of AML patients. It was negative correlation between age and the number of detectable V\u03b2 subfamily sjTRECs in patients with AML, and patients who were < 30 years tended to be higher number of detectable V\u03b2 subfamily sjTRECs than those \u2265 30 years, which became significant at 5\u00d710 4 PBMCs level (r=\u22120.481, p =0.005). Taken together, the recent thymic emigrants of 23 V\u03b2 subfamily nai\u0308ve T cells were absent to a different extent or lower level among patients with AML. These results suggested that AML patients had severe cellular immunodeficiency and the capacity and potential of long-term TCR V\u03b2 repertoire reconstitution were dramatically lowered."
