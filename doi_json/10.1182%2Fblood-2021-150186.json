The expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is one of the main targets of sickle cell disease treatment, as it inhibits the polymerization of hemoglobin S. The hypothesis of an inhibitory threshold of HbF per red blood cell (RBC) has been suggested, 1 although not well defined, as the overall percentage of HbF does not reflect the heterogeneous distribution of HbF per cell. Likewise, the qualitative analysis of RBCs containing HbF, called F cells, is neither reproducible nor clinically interpretable, due to low expression. 2 We have developed a technique for measuring the amount of HbF per cell, to determine thresholds of HbF expression per RBC correlated with clinical and biological effects. 2 Among genes controlling its expression, BCL11A has a major repressive effect on the expression of gamma globin/HbF during the fetal to adult hemoglobin switch. Post-transcriptional silencing of BCL11A, using lentivirus expression of a shRNA embedded in a microRNA architecture (shmiR) to re-activate \u03b3-globin expression, is safe and demonstrates high levels of %HbF in a pilot clinical study (NCT 03282656). 3 Here, we show the quantitative measurement of HbF per RBC and reticulocyte. Methods: During patient follow-up, HbF quantification per single cell RBC was performed using a fluorescent HbF antibody. 2 Addition of an anti-CD71 fluorescent antibody allowed selection of reticulocyte sub-populations for determining their HbF content. Fold-increase in percentage of RBC versus percentage of reticulocyte were calculated. Kinetics of HbF/RBC and HbF/Reticulocyte were modeled using mixed effects polynomial linear regression to account for the correlation between repeated data over time. Results : With a median follow-up of 15 months [12-20] after gene transfer, figure 1 shows the mathematical modeling of single-RBC HbF measurement representing RBC percentage containing at least 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 pg of HbF. Percentage of RBC above each threshold was higher compared to 14 hydroxyurea treated patients for 6 months. Figure 2 shows fold increase between reticulocytes and RBCs with same thresholds of HbF/cell. For low thresholds, RBCs were found in same percentage as reticulocytes whereas RBCs containing increasing levels of HbF were found in higher percentage than reticulocytes, until 6pg/cell showing a clear selective advantage for red cells with a threshold \u2265 6pg/cell of HbF. Figure 3 shows different kinetics of HbF increase according to two different transduction strategies with 2 enhancers in patients 2-4 compared to one enhancer in patients 6-8. Conclusion: BCL11A down-regulation in six clinical trial subjects was associated with an in vivo selection process RBCs with \u2265 6pg HbF per cell attained with different engraftment kinetics, depending on transduction processes, and ultimately stable high level and broadly distributed HbF. 1 Steinberg MH, Chui DH, Dover GJ, Sebastiani P, Alsultan A.
