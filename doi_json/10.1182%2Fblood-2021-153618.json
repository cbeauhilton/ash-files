    "abstract_text": "Introduction/Methods : Enzymes that modify histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27) to thereby regulate gene transcription (epigenetic enzymes) are recurrently inactivated by deletion and/or mutation in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Frustrating understanding of mechanisms is that writers and erasers of the same modification, e.g., methyltransferases that create, and demethylases that remove, H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a repression ('off') mark, are recurrently inactivated. Moreover, acetyltransferases that write H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac), an 'on' mark mutually exclusive with H3K27me3, are also recurrently inactivated. One clue to underlying mechanisms is that MDS/MPN/AML present with diverse lineage and maturation phenotypes - perhaps these emerge from, or select for, the diverse epigenetic enzyme mutations. We therefore identified genes upregulated with specific myeloid lineage-commitment, maturation and function fates (~500 genes each) and then examined distributions of H3K27me3 and H3K27ac at these gene-loci in: (i) embryonic stem cells (ESC); (ii) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC); (iii) mature myeloid cells (monocyte [mono], pro-erythroblast, megakaryocyte [MK]); and (iv) AML cells. Results : Terminal-myeloid programs underwent substantial remodeling to gain H3K27ac 'on' mark from ESC/HSPC to mature myeloid (Fig.1A). Providing a mechanism for this, the H3K27 acetyltransferases EP300 and CREBBP were recruited into the RUNX1/SPI1 myeloid-lineage master transcription factor (MTF) hub by cooperation between their transcription activating domains. Mutated/translocated RUNX1, or mutated-NPM1 that cytoplasmically dislocated SPI1, disrupted this cooperation, and reverted hub content to default recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDAC) instead. Demonstrating cause-effect, inhibiting these HDAC renewed AML cell maturation to terminal lineage-fates. Meanwhile, MYC-target (proliferation) genes have high baseline H3K27ac in ESC and HSPC and do not require major remodeling during ontogeny (Fig.1A). An H3K27ac remodeling requirement for lineage-maturation but not proliferation/housekeeping explains selection pressure for inactivating mutations in EP300 or CREBBP , that we found in ~1.2% of MDS/MPN/AML in our (n=690) and other series. Consistent with pan-lineage-maturation needs for H3K27ac, the mutations were found in all lineage sub-types. H3K27me3 'off' mark was mostly erased from myeloid programs in HSPC, but was greater at MK vs erythroid, and also at mono vs granulocyte genes (Fig.1B). This implied more need for H327me3 demethylase (KDM6A/UTX) for HSPC commitment into MK vs erythroid, or mono vs granulocyte, lineages. Accordingly, KDM6A was most upregulated in MK and mono-lineage cells (Fig.1C), and myeloid-conditional Kdm6a knockout decreased platelets and increased red cells in the spleen - reported by others: https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.V128.22.1467.1467. RUNX1-ETO has been shown to specifically impede granulocytic but not mono differentiation - https://www.nature.com/articles/2403396 and KDM6A inactivating mutations were significantly more likely to occur secondary to RUNX1-ETO (4-9% BEAT and AMLSG case series) vs other cytogenetics (0.005%). Selection for KDM6A secondary mutations could thus be to channel myeloid precursors toward lineages most efficiently impeded by primary mutations. Although H3K27me3 was substantially erased at all myeloid-commitment and terminal programs (except MK) in HSPC vs ESC, subsequent lineage-commitment and maturation entailed rewriting H3K27me3 at preceding HSPC and alternate lineage-fate programs, including at MTF genes for alternate fates (Fig.1B, D). Primary MDS/MPN/AML and AML cell lines with inactivating mutations/deletions in H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 thus displayed aberrant co-expression of lineage MTFs and gene expression programs of normally mutually exclusive lineages (Fig.1E-G). Conclusion . Epigenetic remodeling requirements vary by myeloid lineage and maturation stage. Thus, epigenetic enzyme mutations are selected by, and cause, lineage-context of transformation. This knowledge can guide choice of specific epigenetic enzyme inhibitors to remedy the lineage-maturation defects that drive and define myeloid malignancies.
