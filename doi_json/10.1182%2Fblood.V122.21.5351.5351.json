    "abstract_text": "Background Multiple myeloma (MM) and its benign precursor monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) are diseases characterised by the production of monoclonal immunoglobulins. Clonal heterogeneity in MM has become a well-accepted phenomenon; however dogma would suggest the proteins produced by these clones remain consistent. Free light chain (FLC) escape is one exception to this rule, but is comparatively poorly documented and to our knowledge has not been identified in MGUS patients. Here we report 2 cases of MM patients with intact immunoglobulin and FLC producing clones that have different sensitivities to treatment leading to escape. In addition we report an MGUS patient whose routine corticosteroid treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) impacted on the intact immunoglobulin but not the FLC producing clones and led to an escaping FLC clone which was subsequently diagnosed as myelomic. Methods Serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) were performed using Hydrasys 2 apparatus (SEBIA).\u00a0 Serum free light chain (FLC) levels were measured nephelometrically on a Siemens BN TM II using polyclonal antisera assays, Freelite \u00ae (The Binding Site Group Limited, Birmingham, UK). Results Two intact immunoglobulin MM patients (Patient 1 IgA\u03ba: 14.4g/L, \u03ba FLC: 1320 mg/L, age: 65, sex: male; Patient 2 IgA\u03bb: 8g/L, \u03bb FLC: 9510 mg/L, age: 48, sex: male) were monitored through the course of their disease for 762 and 1330 days respectively. Following cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone (CTD) treatment Patient 1 achieved a VGPR (\u223c90% reduction in IgAk and 65% reduction in FLC) which was stable for 270 days. Subsequently whilst only a trace of IgA\u03ba was present, dFLC levels increased from 460mg/L to 15194mg/L. Patient 2 achieved a CR following treatment with vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (VAD) and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) which was stable for 330 days. As with Patient 1 relapse was characterised by a substantial increase in dFLC from 8.61mg/L to 3168mg/L. In both patients the velocity of change and sensitivity to treatment of the intact immunoglobulin and FLC suggested the presence of heterogeneous clones. A rare biclonal MGUS patient, IgG\u03ba (3.9g/L) and \u03bb FLC (316mg/L), was identified during routine laboratory investigations (age: 71, sex: female) and followed annually in accordance with local guidelines (low/moderate risk MGUS). 16 months following MGUS diagnosis the patient was started on oral methylprednisolone for PMR. The treatment resolved the PMR and coincidently caused a reduction in the IgG\u03ba serum concentration (trace quantities) and a normalisation of the FLC \u03ba/\u03bb ratio. A year post steroidal treatment whilst the IgG\u03ba monoclonal protein concentration remained stable, dFLC levels increased from 9.6 mg/L to 1052 mg/L (\u03ba/\u03bb ratio: 0.008), indicating the emergence of a \u03bb FLC clone although the patient remained asymptomatic. 4 months later and almost 4 years following diagnosis, the patient progressed to symptomatic disease with severe renal impairment (creatinine 6.19 mg/dL; eGFR 7.03 ml/min/1.73m 2 ) anemia (Hb 9.0g/dL) and 70% clonal plasma cells present in the bone marrow. The dFLC concentration had further increased to 9726 mg/L however the IgG\u03ba monoclonal protein was no longer detectable by IFE indicating the biclonal MGUS had progressed to a \u03bb light chain multiple myeloma. Discussion Routine monitoring of MM patients to detect FLC escape is recommended by international guidelines, in light of the MGUS patient FLC escape leading to MM, we suggest routine evaluation of FLC levels in MGUS may also be beneficial.
