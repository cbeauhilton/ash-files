    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3744 [Introduction] Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for BCR-ABL have dramatically improved the treatment outcome of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) during this decade, however, the resistance to TKIs due to various molecular mechanisms, such as BCR-ABL mutations, dysfunction of cell killing mechanisms like BIM deregulation, or the supports by leukemia microenvironment factors, has remained to be overcome. We have identified that BIM, a member of BH3-only proteins, is the essential pro-apoptotic mediator under the blockade of BCR-ABL signaling (Kuroda J, PNAS, 2006). One of the attractive therapeutic strategies for complete eradication of CML cells by simultaneously targeting both TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant CML cells may be the use of agents that can activate BIM as well as other pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein which is not utilized in apoptosis by TKIs. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic potential of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activator Fingolimod (FTY720), an immunosuppressive agent currently used for multiple sclerosis, in CML. [Materials and methods] Human CML-derived cell lines, K562, MYL, KBM5, KCL22, and their various subclones, were utilized in this study. Murine Ba/F3 lymphoid cells were transfected with either wild type or mutated bcr-abl gene. FTY720 was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Cell death analyses were performed using flow cytometry. Protein levels were determined by conventional Western blotting. [Result and discussion] Treatment with FTY720 impairs phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and its downstream targets, AKT, ERK and STAT5, and inhibited the growth of CML cell lines through the induction of apoptosis. The apoptosis induced by FTY720 was accompanied by the activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-9, while enforced expression of either BCL2 or dominant-negative protein of FADD (FADD.DN) by gene introduction partly protected K562 cells from apoptosis by FTY720, indicating the involvement of both cell extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways in FTY720-induced apoptosis. FTY720 treatment resulted in the activation of Bim as well as the processing of Bid into tBid, a BH3-only protein which plays crucial role in accelerating death-receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptosis pathway and is not utilized in apoptosis by TKIs. Importantly, gene knockdown of either BIM or BID partly protected K562 cells from apoptosis by FTY720, but the degrees of cell protection by those were not as much as the degree of cell protection by overexpression of either BCL2 or FADD.DN. Moreover, double knockdown of BIM and BID did not further protect K562 cells from apoptosis by FTY720, when compared with single knockdown of BIM. These results indicate that BIM and BID compensate each other for promoting apoptosis by FTY720 in CML cells, especially when either of them is functionally disturbed. Through these mechanisms, FTY720 overcomes TKI resistance by various mechanisms, such as ABL kinase domain (KD) mutations in BCR-ABL-transfected Ba/F3 cells (T315I, G250E, E255K or H396P) and in KBM5 cells with T315I. FTY720 also overcomes TKI resistance due to dysfunction of BIM by gene deletion polymorphism in KCL22 cells. Also, although galectin-3 overexpression has been shown to mediate bone marrow environment-mediated drug resistance in CML cells (Yamamoto-Sugitani M, PNAS, 2011), the addition of FTY720 to imatinib overcomes resistance to imatinib in galectin-3 overexpressing K562 cells and MYL cells. In conclusion, FTY720 induces apoptotic cell death in CML via dual activation of both BIM and BID, and is potent in overcoming various types of cell intrinsic and tumor microenvironment-mediated resistance to TKI.
