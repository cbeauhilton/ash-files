    "abstract_text": "Reported predictors of quality of life (QOL) after stem cell transplantation (SCT) are largely limited to biological variables. We used data from a large prospective study of autologous and allogeneic SCT recipients to test whether self-reported functioning also predicts later QOL. Surveys were collected at baseline and at 6 and 12 months following transplant and included sociodemographic variables, self-reported physical and mental functioning, and perceptions of health and recovery. Multivariate models for QOL variables at 6 and 12 months were constructed, considering baseline clinical variables (age, sex, type of transplant, disease status) and baseline QOL variables (the Short-Form 36 (SF36) physical (PCS) and mental health (MCS) scales, and a rating scale (RS)), controlling for clinical events (acute and chronic graft-vs.-host (GVHD), and relapse). Variables with p<0.05 are reported. Of 300 patients who completed baseline surveys, 197 (111 allogeneic) completed 6 month surveys, and 175 (94 allogeneic) completed 12 month surveys. Patients reporting very good or excellent health at 6 months had higher baseline health rating scales (p<.0001) and were less likely to have developed chronic GVHD (OR=.27, p=.03) or to be married/partnered (OR=.32, p=.003). Better physical health (higher PCS) at 6 months was associated with better baseline physical and mental health (p<.0001 and p=.02), and absence of acute GVHD (p<.0001) and relapse (p=.01). Baseline physical health was the strongest predictor (partial R 2 =.20, model R 2 =.31). Better mental health (higher MCS) at 6 months was associated with better baseline mental health (p<.0001), older age (p=.049), and not being married/partnered (p=.04). Baseline mental health was the strongest predictor (partial R 2 0.17, model R 2 =.20). At 6 months, agreement with the statement \u201clife is back to normal\u201d was associated with baseline health rating scale (p",
