Approval of biosimilar G-CSF is in the same indications as the originator, including autologous and allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilisation, for which it is being used throughout our large hospital group in Paris, France. Concerns have been raised by professional bodies over use of biosimilar G-CSF in allogeneic transplants. To our knowledge, this is the first reported use of biosimilar G-CSF in healthy donors for allogeneic transplantation. METHODS: Healthy related donors received biosimilar G-CSF (EP-2006, Sandoz Biopharmaceuticals) 10 \u03bcg/kg/day for PBSC mobilisation. G-CSF was administered on days 1\u20134 with the first leukapheresis performed on day 5. If the required number of CD34+ cells per recipient body weight (4 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg) was not collected, G-CSF administration was continued and a second PBSC collection was performed on day 6. Further G-CSF administration and a third leukapheresis was done on day 7 if required. RESULTS: Twelve healthy donors (7 male, 5 female; mean \u00b1 SD age 61.0 \u00b1 7.8 years, range 51\u201373) received biosimilar G-CSF for PBSC mobilisation. Median donor body weight was 82 kg (range 55\u2013115 kg). Median CD34+ cell count on day 5 was 75/ml (range 23\u2013140). A single leukapheresis after 4 injections of biosimilar G-CSF was sufficient to collect the CD34+ cell dose required in six donors with peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ counts ranging from 80\u2013140 ml. Six donors underwent a second leukapheresis after 5 days of biosimilar G-CSF, one of whom (a 73-year old female) underwent a third leukaphereses on day 7 (PB CD34+ at first apheresis 23 ml). Median number of CD34+ cells per recipient bodyweight was 5.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/kg (range 2.6\u20138.9). Five donors reported bone pain (4 mild, 1 moderate severity) which was effectively treated with paracetamol. No other adverse events were reported. Blood measurements were normal in all donors when assessed one week after the end of mobilisation. These findings are consistent with our previous use of originator G-CSF (Neupogen \u00ae ) in allogeneic stem cell mobilisation. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings suggest biosimilar G-CSF is effective and well-tolerated in allogeneic stem cell mobilisation. Further studies are required to assess longer-term safety outcomes. The use of biosimilar G-CSF may provide important cost-savings when compared with the originator product.
