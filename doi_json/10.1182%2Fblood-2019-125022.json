    "abstract_text": "Single Cell RNA Sequencing Identifies a Crucial Role for ASXL1 in Neutrophil Development Additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1) is a polycomb-associated protein that is essential for normal hematopoiesis. ASXL1 is recurrently mutated across the spectrum of myeloid malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms and Acute Myeloid Leukemia. ASXL1 mutations are also found in the premalignant disorders clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential and clonal cytopenias of indeterminate potential. In all cases, ASXL1 mutations are associated with more aggressive disease biology and resistance to treatment. Mutations in ASXL1 broadly dysregulate the hematopoietic system, opening chromatin at genes associated with differentiation and self-renewal, predisposing to malignant transformation. However, in spite of this, the specific role of ASXL1 at different phases of hematopoiesis remains unknown. Indeed, the development of therapeutic approaches for ASXL1-mutant malignancies will require a nuanced understanding of the role of ASXL1 in directing normal blood development to maximize on target effects and minimize toxicity. ASXL1 mutations are commonly identified in myeloid disorders with dysplasia. In the neutrophil lineage, morphologic dysplasia is associated with nuclear-cytoplasmic dyssynchrony, where neutrophils demonstrate differences in nuclear and cytoplasmic differentiation (i.e. hypolobated nuclei or hypogranular cytoplasm). Given its associated with dysplasia, we hypothesized that ASXL1 plays a fundamental role in neutrophil maturation. To investigate this, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on lineage depleted bone marrow from MX-1 Cre/Asxl1 FL/FL mice (Asxl1 KO ) or cre negative littermate controls (Asxl1 WT ). This analysis revealed a loss of multi-lineage differentiation potential in response to Asxl1 deletion with the most prominent effects noted in myeloid differentiation. Although the neutrophil-primed granulocyte-macrophage progenitors appeared relatively normal, a differentiation block was identified at the transition between promyelocytes and myelocytes. Specifically, Asxl1 KO mice demonstrated a failure to normally upregulate specific granule constituents. Although key differentiation-associated transcription factors are present in the appropriate precursor populations, they appear to require normal Asxl1 function to effectively initiate transcription of specific granule genes. This is the first description of a crucial role for Asxl1 in terminal neutrophil differentiation. Furthermore, the failure to effectively upregulate specific granule genes in Asxl1 deficient mice may provide a mechanistic explanation for the dysplasia-associated hypogranular neutrophils present in dysplastic disorders with mutant ASXL1.
