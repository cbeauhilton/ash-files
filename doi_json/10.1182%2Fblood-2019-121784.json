    "abstract_text": "Background : Despite the general efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the treatment of patients (pts) with chronic myeloid leukemia patients (CML). Approximately 30-40% of CML pts need to switch to an alternative TKIs because of resistance or intolerance. Bosutinib is a Src/Abl TKI approved for treating adults with chronic phase (CP), accelerated (AP), or blast phase (BP) Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+) CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapies, and as frontline therapy in CP-CML. Methods : We reviewed the records of CML pts who received bosutinib in 2nd-9th line of therapy between 2006 and 2018. Response to therapy was assessed by standard criteria and overall (OS), failure-free (FFS), event-free (EFS), and transformation-free survival (TFS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier methods and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for 5-year survival estimates. Results : Seventy pts were identified who received bosutinib for CML, 68 in chronic phase, 1 in accelerated phase and 1 in blast phase. We focus here on the 68 pts in CP. The median age was 52 years (range, 24 to 87). Fifty percent had received one prior TKI, 31% 2 prior TKIs, and 19% 3 or more prior TKIs. Three patients had received stem cell transplant and 7 had received interferon. The median follow-up was 126 months (range, 53 to 151) and the median duration of therapy was 24 months (range, 1 to 150). The median starting dose of bosutinib was 500 mg (range, 100 to 600). Forty four pts (65%) started at 500 mg and 14 pts (21%) started at 400 mg. At last follow-up 47 pts (69%) had discontinued therapy (9 pts due to AEs, 37pts due to resistance, one pt due to other reasons). Intermittent dose reductions were frequently required but 47 pts (69%) were still receiving their starting dose (including 75% of those starting at 500 and all those starting at 400 mg). The most common adverse event was diarrhea in 68% but it was mostly grade 1; 6 pts had grade 3 diarrhea (9%) and 2 of them had treatment discontinuation due to diarrhea. Two pts developed pulmonary hypertension and 2 cerebrovascular accidents while on therapy [table2]. Best response was major cytogenetic response 13 (19%), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in 1 (1.5% %), major molecular response (MMR) in 5 (7 %), MR 4.5 in 3 (4.4 %), sustained MR 4.5 in 10 (14.7 %) and complete molecular response (CMR, undetectable transcripts with at least 100,000 ABL copies) in 2 (3%) [table2]. Seven pts (10%) had CCyR before starting bosutinib, all maintained CCyR while they were taking bosutinib. The rates of 60 months OS, EFS, FFS, and TFS were 96% (95% CI 89.8%-100.0%), 85% (95% CI 76.3%-94.8%), 94% (95% CI 87.8%-100.0%), 56% (95% CI 42.9%-73.0%), respectively. Two patients with F317L mutation and both achieved CCyR and MMR. Baseline mutations before staring bosutinib are L248V, M244V, E463, M315T, and S359V. Conclusions: Bosutinib is an effective treatment option for patients who have received multiple prior therapies, and associated with an acceptable toxicity.
