    "abstract_text": "We reviewed flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI) data of 470 tissue suspensions suspected of being involved by lymphoma (371 lymph nodes, 263 surgical biopsies and 108 fine needle aspirations,16 spleens, 6 tonsils, and 77 other tissues) and we have compared corresponding histologic diagnosis. The screening panel of FCI (CD45, CD19, CD3, CD4, CD8, and sIg\u03ba/sIg\u03bb ratio) identified three main groups: 239 cases with demonstrable light chain restriction (sIg\u03ba/sIg\u03bb ratio \u2264 0.5 or \u22654); 37 cases with demonstrable T cell proliferation and polyclonal B cell population; 194 cases with polyclonal B cell and normal T cell populations (146 cases) or with not detectable CD45 reactivity and other leucocyte markers (48 cases). In group 1, 235 cases were then evaluated by means of the following markers: CD5, CD10, CD11a, CD11c, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD30, CD38, CD43, CD79a\u2013b, CD103, CD138, FMC7, and, in group 2, 30 cases were evaluated by means of the following markers: CD1a, CD2, CD5, CD7, CD16, CD26, CD43, CD56, CD57, CD45RA/RO, anti-TCR-ab gd. The complete analysis identified in group 1 four main diagnostic subsets: A (26 cases) characterized by CD5+, CD23+/\u00b1, sIg dim (CLL-like); B (36 cases) characterized by CD5+, sIg bright (MCL/CLLv); C (89 cases) characterized by heterogeneous expression of Ig, CD20 and CD43 (lymphoproliferative syndromes CD5\u2212, excluding hairy cell leukemia); D (84 cases) characterized by CD10+, CD20 bright, CD43\u2212 (follicular NHL like). In cluster B, FISH analysis for t(11;14) resulted positive in 15/27 cases; in cluster D, FISH analysis for t(14;18) resulted positive in 60/60 cases. Histologic analysis convalidated FCI data in 23 cases of subset A (88%), in 29 cases of subset B (80%) and in 60 cases of subset D (71%). Subset C included 39 cases of LCL and 15 cases of MZL. In group 2, all cases studied expressed an aberrant T phenotype but, with the exception of 1 case of NK proliferation, 1 case of likely Sezary syndrome/Micosis Fungoides (CD4+CD7\u2212CD26\u2212) and 1 case of T lymphoblastic lymphoma (CD3cy+TdT+), in the other 34 cases was not possible identify other peculiar subset. In this group, histologic analysis included 19 cases of NHL T (63%). Considering NHL vs no NHL, sensibility (SE) and specificity (SP) of FCI analysis resulted 88% and 92%, respectively; positive predictive value (PPV) was 96% and negative predictive value (NPV 78%). Considering B-cell NHL only, SE was 91%, SP 95%, PPV 97% and NPV 84%. Even if histology is the basis for the diagnosis of lymphoid tumors, however our study supports that FCI can play an important role mainly in B-NHL diagnosis, combining rapidity of analysis with a multiparametric analysis, also in presence of size limitated samples."
