    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND JULIET (NCT02445248) is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, global, pivotal phase 2 trial of tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy targeting CD19, that has shown a high rate of durable complete responses (CR) and a manageable safety profile in adult patients with clinically active relapsed/refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The primary objective was met at the interim analysis, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 59% (CR, 43%; partial response [PR], 16%). Here, we present an updated analysis of the JULIET trial, with a median of 19 months of follow-up, an additional 5 months since the previous report (Schuster et al. EHA 2018), demonstrating sustained activity in this patient population. METHODS Eligible patients were \u226518 years with r/r DLBCL, had received \u22652 lines of therapy, including rituximab and an anthracycline, and were ineligible for or had failed autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Tisagenlecleucel was centrally manufactured at 2 facilities (Morris Plains, NJ, USA [main cohort] and Leipzig, Germany [cohort A]) using cryopreserved apheresis material and provided to patients at 27 treatment sites across 10 countries on 4 continents using a global supply chain. The primary endpoint was ORR (CR + PR) per independent review committee. Efficacy results are reported for patients in the main cohort with \u22653 months of follow-up or earlier discontinuation; safety is reported for all infused patients. RESULTS At data cutoff (May 21, 2018), 167 patients were enrolled and 115 were infused (99 in the main cohort and 16 in cohort A) with a single dose of tisagenlecleucel (median, 3.0\u00d710 8 [range, 0.1-6.0\u00d710 8 ] CAR-positive viable T cells). 90% of infused patients received bridging therapy and 93% received lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Median time from infusion to data cutoff was 19.3 months. Median age was 56 years (range, 22-76 years); 23% were aged \u226565 years. At study entry, 77% of infused patients had stage III/IV disease and 17% had double/triple hit disease. 55% and 43% had germinal center and activated B-cell molecular subtypes, respectively. 51% of patients had received \u22653 prior lines of antineoplastic therapy (range, 1-6); 49% had undergone a prior ASCT. All 99 patients in the main cohort had \u22653 months of follow-up or discontinued earlier and were evaluable for efficacy. ORR was 54% (95% CI, 43%-64%), with 40% CR and 13% PR. ORR was consistent across prognostic subgroups (including prior ASCT and double/triple-hit lymphoma). Median duration of response (DOR) was not reached; the probability of being relapse free was 66% (95% CI, 51%-78%) at 6 months and 64% (95% CI, 48%-76%) at 12 and 18 months. DOR was similar by age group (\u2265 vs < 65 years) and by relapsed or refractory status (Figure). No relapses were observed beyond 11 months after infusion. Median OS for all infused patients was 11.1 months (95% CI, 6.6 months-NE) and not reached (95% CI, 21 months-NE) for patients in CR. OS probability was 48% (95% CI, 38%-57%) at 12 months and 43% (95%CI, 33%-53%) at 18 months (max follow-up, 29 months). No patients proceeded to allogeneic SCT or ASCT while in remission. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) of special interest within 8 weeks of infusion included cytopenias lasting >28 days (34%), cytokine release syndrome (CRS; 23%, by the Penn scale), infections (19%), febrile neutropenia (15%), neurological events (11%; 1 case of grade 2 cerebral edema), and tumor lysis syndrome (2%). 16% of patients received tocilizumab for CRS management. 3 patients died within 30 days of infusion (all due to disease progression). No treatment-related mortality was reported. Since the previous report, no new deaths occurred due to causes other than disease progression. CONCLUSION Results from this longer-term follow-up show that tisagenlecleucel produced high response rates and durable responses in a cohort of heavily pretreated adult patients with r/r DLBCL. Efficacy was consistent in all predefined subgroups, including elderly patients, patients with r/r disease, and other clinical or biological subgroups expected to have a worse prognosis with available treatments, as demonstrated by similar and sustained DOR and OS following tisagenlecleucel treatment.
