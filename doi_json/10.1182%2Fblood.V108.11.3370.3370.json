    "abstract_text": "In 1991, we reported the results of 127 patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who underwent conditioning for allogeneic transplant with busulfan, 4 mg/kg on each of 4 days and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg on each of 2 days. In the current abstract, we report data on 295 patients, including the initial cohort, who underwent allogenic transplantation for AML from 1984 to 1995 at 7 participating institutions. Median age of patients is 33. One hundred forty nine men and 126 women underwent transplant. All patients received marrow from related HLA-identical donors. One hundred seven patients (36%) remain alive. One hundred forty one patients were transplanted in first remission (group I), 43 in second remission (group II) and 111 patients were in > 2 nd remission or had refractory disease (group III). The median follow-up of patients in the initial study was 3 years and is 12 years in the current study. Seventy-five percent of patients surviving 3 years after transplantation are estimated survivors 12 years after transplant. Relapse (20), chronic GVHD (5) and infection (3) were the major causes of death in patients who died more than 3 years after transplantation. The estimated relapse rate for group I at 3 and 12 years is 18%(95% CI: 2\u201332%) and 29% (95% CI 11\u201347%) for group II is 40% (95% CI: 8\u201372%) and 52% (95% CI: 16\u201384%), and group III is 59% (95% CI: 37\u201381%) and 69% (95% CI: 45\u201393%) respectively. The estimated leukemia-free survival (LFS) for group I at 3 and 12 years is 60% (95% CI: 44\u201376%) and 47% (95% CI: 29\u201365%), for group II is 47% (95% CI: 17\u201377%) and 34% (95% CI: 4\u2013 64%)and group III is 22% (95% CI: 6\u201338%) and 15% (95% CI: 1\u201329%) respectively. Remission stage was predictive of long-term LFS (P<0.001), with patients transplanted in first remission doing better than the rest. Older age was a risk factor for late failure (death or relapse beyond 3 years, P=0.05). Remission stage at transplant (p=0.44), chronic GVHD (P=0.08) and acute GVHD (P=0.12) were not significantly predictive of late failure. In conclusion a vast majority of patients alive and well at 3 years post transplant seem destined to be cured. A proportion of patients do fail beyond 3 years, but the remission stage of disease at transplant is not predictive of late failure.",
