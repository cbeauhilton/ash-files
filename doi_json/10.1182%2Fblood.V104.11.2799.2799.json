    "abstract_text": "Background : In B-CLL, the observation of interphase cells with hemizygous D13S319 deletion at 13q14 (13q-x1) as a sole anomaly in blood is widely considered a favorable prognosis. The observation of cells with 11q-, +12 or 17p- has been associated with a relatively poor prognosis. Over the past 1.5 yrs, 16.2% (174/1,076) of patients (pts) referred for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing for B-CLL in our clinical practice had a clone with homozygous D13S319 deletion (13q-x2), but the prognostic significance of this observation is poorly understood. Moreover, 39.3% (142/361) of pts with unfavorable FISH anomalies have 13q-x1 and/or 13q-x2 and the clinical significance of this observation is also unknown. Thus, we investigated pts with 13q- (with or without other chromosome anomalies) to establish the relative clinical significance of 13q- in B-CLL. Methods : We studied 333 pts with B-CLL sampled between 9/1999 and 6/2004 who had FISH performed on interphase nuclei from blood. The FISH probe set was designed to detect 6q-, 11q-, +12, 13q-, 17p-, and translocations involving IgH at 14q32. We classified pts into four groups: 13q-x1 only (group 1), 13q-x1 and 13q-x2 only (group 2), 13q-x2 only (group 3) and 13q-x1 and/or 13q-x2 plus other FISH anomalies (group 4). FISH groups were compared with gender, age, Rai stage, treatment status, time to treatment, CD38 and IgV H mutation. Results : Of the 333 pts, 171 (51.3%) had a 13q-: 71 were in group 1, 25 in group 2, 26 in group 3 and 49 in group 4. %CD38+ differed significantly across FISH groups; in pairwise analyses, the proportion of pts with >30% CD38+ was significantly greater for pts in group 4 vs. group 3 (p=0.0015) although no significant differences were observed for group 3 vs. group 1 or vs. group 2. Pts in group 3 were not significantly different from other FISH groups for Rai stage, IgV H mutation or gender. The median percentage of abnormal nuclei for pts with group 1 was 54.5% vs. 79.5% for pts in group 4 (p<0.0001). The median percent abnormal nuclei for pts in groups 3 and 2 was 72.5% and 68.5%, respectively. Median % abnormal nuclei for group 3 was not significantly different than the other FISH groups. Treatment status was available on 147 pts, where the proportion of pts who had treatment in each group was as follows: group 1, 15/66; group 2, 2/22; group 3, 4/21; and group 4, 9/38. Due to limited sample size and heavy censoring, any analysis on time to treatment is preliminary; however, these early analyses suggest group 4 pts have a lower median time to treatment (9 yrs) compared to groups 3 and 1 (12.3 and 13 yrs, respectively). Conclusions : This study has generated new information about the 13q- anomaly in B-CLL. First, known prognostic markers for B-CLL pts with 13q-x2 are not significantly different than for pts with 13q-x1 or 13q-x1/13q-x2. Second, 13q-x1 and/or 13q-x2 occurring with other unfavorable FISH anomalies have an unfavorable prognosis; i.e. potential benefits of 13q- are trumped when it is observed with unfavorable FISH anomalies. Thus, patients with any form of 13q- alone may have indolent disease while patients with 13q- and unfavorable FISH anomalies should be considered to be in a more aggressive phase."
