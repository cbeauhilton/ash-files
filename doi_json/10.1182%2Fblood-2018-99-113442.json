    "abstract_text": "Background: Mutations of the NPM1 gene are one of the most frequent genetic aberrations in adult AML. AML with mutated NPM1 is categorized as a disease entity according the WHO-2016 classification and clinically associated with female sex, high white blood cells at diagnosis, normal karyotype and high CD33 antigen expression. We recently showed that patients with NPM1 -mutated AML benefit from all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as adjunct to intensive induction therapy (Ann Hematol. 2016; 95:1931-1942; Haematologica. 2009;94:54-60). Based on the regular high CD33 expression in AML with mutated NPM1 we hypothesized that gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) added to intensive therapy with ATRA may further improve clinical outcome in AML with mutated NPM1 . Aim: To evaluate GO in combination with intensive induction and consolidation therapy and ATRA in NPM1 mutated AML within the randomized AMLSG 09-09 trial (NCT00893399) Methods: Between May 2010 and September 2017, patients \u226518 years of age and considered eligible for intensive therapy were randomized up-front for open-label treatment with GO. Induction therapy consisted of two cycles of A-ICE (idarubicin 12mg/m\u00b2 iv, day 1,3,5 [in induction II and for patients >60 years reduced to d 1, 3]; cytarabine 100mg/m\u00b2 continuous iv, day 1 to 7; etoposide 100mg/m\u00b2 iv, day 1-3 [in induction II and for patients >60 years reduced to d 1, 3]; ATRA 45 mg/m\u00b2/day po on days 6-8 and 15mg/m\u00b2 days 9-21, +/- GO 3mg/m\u00b2 iv day 1). Consolidation therapy consisted of 3 cycles of high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC; 3g/m\u00b2 [reduced to 1g/m\u00b2 in patients >60 years] bid, days 1-3; Pegfilgrastim 6mg sc, day 10; ATRA 15 mg/m\u00b2/day po, days 4-21; +/- GO 3mg/m\u00b2 on day 1 [first consolidation only]). The primary endpoints of the study were event-free survival (EFS) as early endpoint tested 6 months and overall survival (OS) tested 4 years after study completion with sequential testing according the fallback procedure described by Wiens (Statistics 2003;2:211-215). This report focusses on the early EFS endpoint. Further secondary endpoints were response to induction therapy, cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and cumulative incidence of death (CID). Results: In total 588 patients were evaluable for analysis (n=296, standard-arm; n=292 GO-arm). Median age was 58.7 years (range, 18.4-82.3 years), ECOG performance status was 0 in 34.1% and 1 in 55.1%, and FLT3 -ITD was present in 16.8% of the patients, with baseline characteristics well balanced between the two arms. After first induction therapy death rates were significantly higher in the GO-arm (7.5%) (p=0.02) compared to the standard-arm (3.4%); in both study-arms causes of death were mainly infections. Following induction therapy complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) were 88.5% and 85.3% (p=0.28), refractory disease (RD) 6.1% and 5.1% (p=0.72), death 5.4% and 9.6% (p=0.06) in the standard- and GO-arm, respectively. Due to prolonged thrombocytopenia after second induction therapy in the GO-arm, the protocol was amended in that GO was omitted in second induction and first consolidation cycles, if prolonged cytopenias were observed during first induction therapy. The study treatment was completed in 197 and 171 patients (p=0.11), allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in first CR was performed in 18 and 21 patients (p=0.51) in the standard- and GO-arm, respectively. Median follow-up was 2.6 years (95%-CI, 2.4-3.1 years). Two- and 4-year EFS were 53% (95%-CI, 48-60%) and 58% (95%-CI, 52%-64%), and 44% (95%-CI, 38-52%) and 52% (95%-CI, 46%-59%) in the standard- and GO-arm, respectively. According to the pre-specified significance level of 0.025, EFS in the GO-arm was not different to that in the standard-arm (p=0.21). In patients achieving CR/CRi after induction therapy, CIR was significantly reduced in the GO-arm compared to the standard-arm (p=0.018), whereas no difference in CID was noted between both arms (p=0.89). Conclusion : The addition of GO to intensive induction therapy with ICE plus ATRA was associated with a higher death rate. In patients achieving a CR/CRi after induction therapy significantly less relapses occurred in the GO- compared to the standard-arm. Disclosures Schlenk: Pfizer: Research Funding, Speakers Bureau.
