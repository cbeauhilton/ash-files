    "abstract_text": "The final steps of heme biosynthesis include the transport of coproporphyrin with the transport step probably mediated by the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). Within the mitochondria copropoprhyrin is then converted to protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) which in turn is converted to hemin with insertion of iron by ferrochelatase. PBR is ubiquitously expressed and has been implicated in steriodogenesis, apoptosis, erythroid differentiation, and inflammation. Interestingly, PPIX is among several high affinity ligands for PBR. Various cytosolic proteins that interact with PBR have also been defined including PBR associated protein 7 (PAP7). The various PBR ligands including PPIX may affect the binding of these proteins to PBR. We have demonstrated ( Blood , Nov 2004 ; 104 : 53 ) that DAP, a protein highly homologous to PAP7, binds to the C-terminus of DMT1 and may have a role in regulation of intracellular iron transport. We, therefore, examined the effects of PPIX on the functions of DAP and other proteins that affect cellular iron metabolism. DAP is 526 amino acid protein with a nuclear localization signal domain (aa 212\u2013229) and a Golgi localization domain (aa 380\u2013524), and is distributed in the cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, and nuclei of K562 cells. K562 cells were grown in the presence of 5 \u03bcM PPIX for 24 hours and then the expression of DAP, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), and ferritin examined by western blot analysis. In addition, cells were grown in medium of either normal iron content (3.5 \u03bcM from ferri-transferrin), high iron content (217 \u03bcM from the addition of ferric ammonium citrate), or low iron content (by the addition of 50 mM desferroxamine). Under all three iron conditions PPIX induced differentiation but down-regulated ferritin expression and up-regulated TfR1 expression. Additionally, PPIX had a striking effect on DAP expression markedly decreasing DAP levels but only in cells grown either in normal or low iron medium. In addition, PPIX affected the expression of the iron transporter DMT1in parallel with DAP. As PPIX induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells we examined the effects of hemin which can also induce differentiation of K562 cells. In contrast to PPIX, hemin caused strong down-regulation of TfR and up-regulation of ferritin and DAP. The down-regulation of DAP induced by PPIX was restored by the addition of hemin. These results indicate that PPIX affects DAP expression and other important elements involved in cellular iron metabolism and that these effects are partially modified by the iron status of the cell."
