    "abstract_text": "Background: Despite development of new therapies and advances in autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), MM remains, for the most part, an incurable condition. Allogeneic HSCT, through induction of a graft-versus-myeloma effect, can potentially overcome resistance to conventional therapy and induce prolonged disease control. Such approach is limited by the risk of acute and chronic GVHD and the high treatment-related mortality and has been restricted to young patients with aggressive or refractory disease. We reviewed our experience with allogeneic HSCT at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Methods: Retrospective single-institution review of consecutive allogeneic transplants performed for multiple myeloma between 1991 and 2006. Results: Thirty-three patients underwent a myeloablative (52%) or reduced-intensity conditioning (48%) HSCT 3.2 months to 15 years after their diagnosis of multiple myeloma (n=31) or plasma cell leukemia (n=2). Median age at the time of HSCT was 48 years (range 33\u201361) and 19 patients (57%) had received one (n=12) or two (n=7) prior autologous HSCT. Donors were HLA-matched siblings in 25 cases (76%), matched unrelated (n=8), and 5/6 (n=1) and 6/6 (n=1) match, non-sibling family members. Source of HSC was peripheral blood exclusively in 21 (64%) and bone marrow in 12 (35%) transplants. Outcomes are being reported after a median follow up of 21.8 months (25.6 for survivors). Day+100 mortality was 21.2% and the incidences of any grade and grades 3/4 acute GVHD were 54.5% and 33.3% respectively. Among the 26 patients surviving beyond day+100, 57.7% developed chronic extensive GVHD. All 6 patients transplanted after a complete response (CR) to prior therapy remained so after the transplant. Of the 27 patients with measurable disease, disease reassessment could be performed for 20 after the transplant. Ten patients (50%) achieved a CR or near-CR and 8 patients (40%) obtained a partial response. Median time to progression and overall survival (Figure) after HSCT were 21.8 and 40.6 months respectively. Twenty-one patients have died, 10 as a consequence of disease progression. Twelve patients are alive, including 6 patients in CR, 8.3 to 172.7 months after the transplant. In a multivariate model the use of a non-sibling donor and peripheral blood HSC were associated with decreases risk of relapse, but had no effect on overall survival. Conclusion: Allogeneic HSCT is a feasible treatment for young patient with adverse disease features. Graft-versus-myeloma can induced myeloma eradication and prolonged disease control.
