    "abstract_text": "The protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) functions as a tumor suppressor by counteracting oncogenic kinase signaling. Suppression of PP2A activity represents a critical process in the development and maintenance of many neoplasms, including myeloid malignancies; PP2A inhibition de-represses numerous proliferative and survival signaling pathways. However, complete loss of PP2A is lethal to cells. As such, indirect reactivation of PP2A has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for myeloid leukemias. Yet the broad applicability of such a strategy remains uncertain, as it relies on targeting endogenous PP2A inhibitors. In the present work we investigated the effects of direct acting small molecule activators of PP2A (SMAPs) (Sandokar et al. JCI 2017) on myeloid leukemia cells and uncovered a novel link between PP2A reactivation and NOXA-mediated apoptosis. This mechanism explains our observation of cooperativity between SMAPs and the BH3 mimetic ABT-199 (venetoclax). Additionally, we found that SMAPs elicit a protective stress response that can be overcome by inhibition ofprotein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). Given the known role of PP2A inactivation in both acute and chronic myeloid leukemia (AML and CML), we first tested the activity of SMAPs against cell lines derived from both diseases. Across all cell lines tested (CML- K562, Meg-01; AML- MOLM-14, HL-60, OCI-AML3, THP-1) SMAPs caused a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability. It is known that reactivation of PP2A induces apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells, though this area has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we first sought to clarify the mode of cell death in response to PP2A reactivation. Both by biochemical and flow cytometric analyses, SMAPs showed activation of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade. Furthermore, SMAP-mediated cell death was blocked by co-treatment with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK (50 \u03bcM). We previously demonstrated the target specificity of SMAPs for PP2A with methods including expression of SV40 small T antigen and PP2A alpha subunit drug-binding mutants (Sandokar et al. JCI 2017). Here, we confirmed that pre-treatment with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid at a dose that retains selectivity for PP2A (10 nM) attenuated SMAP-induced cell death and cleavage of PARP and caspase-3. Next, we investigated the effectors of SMAP-mediated apoptosis. To this end, we performed Western blots to detect changes in abundance and/or phosphorylation of a panel of Bcl-2 family member proteins. Interestingly, a strong upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein NOXA occurred consistently across AML and CML cell lines. Further RT-PCR studies showed this increase to occur at the transcript level. Knockdown studies confirmed the importance of NOXA for SMAP-mediated apoptosis. These data represent the first reported link between PP2A and NOXA regulation. Since SMAPs target the NOXA-MCL1 axis of the Bcl-2 family, we next tested their efficacy in combination with the Bcl-2-selective BH3 mimetic ABT-199. We found co-treatment with SMAPs and ABT-199 to exhibit enhanced cell death compared to either agent alone. Concurrent with NOXA elevation, SMAP treatment modulated protein expression and phosphorylation levels for several known pathways downstream of PP2A. Interestingly, we additionally observed increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha (eIF2\u03b1) in SMAP-treated cells which correlated with upregulation of mRNA and protein for the downstream transcription factor ATF4. Blockade of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation with PERK inhibitor GSK2656157 (350 nM) prevented ATF4 elevation and enhanced SMAP-induced apoptosis. This result supports the idea that the integrated stress response (ISR) via PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 acts to counter apoptosis in the context of PP2A reactivation in myeloid leukemia cells. Thus, the efficacy of SMAPs and other PP2A-activating therapeutics may be enhanced by combination with both BH3 mimetics and inhibitors of the ISR.
