    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4240 Introduction: Liposomal Cytarabine for intrathecal administration is characterized by prolonged activity and better penetration to central nervous system (CNS). This makes it promising medicine for treating children with hematopoietic malignancies relapsing in CNS or refractory CNS disease. The purpose of the Study: The study aimed at retrospective evaluation of the effectiveness of liposomal Cytarabine (Depocyte\u00ae) administrated intrathecally as a part of the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies in Polish children. Patients and methods: The study group consisted of 23 patients, 11 boys and 12 girls, treated in the centers of Polish Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group, including 18 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 3 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and two children with high grade Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphomas (NHL). The median age of the children was 10.8 years (range: 1.3 to 18 years). Liposomal cytarabine treatment was administered on compassionate basis to 20 children with relapsed acute leukemia / NHL, a single child with secondary leukemia, one patient with severe neurotoxicity after intrathecal Methotrexate during front-line treatment and in one child with large granulocytic sarcoma, penetrating into CNS. Thirteen patients received liposomal cytarabine dosage of 50 mg, while the remaining 10 children were exposed to the doses of 25\u201335 mg, all in association with prophylactic dexamethasone administration. The number of liposomal Cytarabine injections ranged from 1 to 11, mean 5 doses per patient. Results: The clearance of CNS disease was achieved in 15 of 23 patients (65%). Eight children were alive during the follow-up procedure, including 3 patients in complete remission after treatment completion. Grade IV neurotoxicity was observed in five children, which might be also partly related to CNS malignancy. Another side effects occurred in 4 patients, including headache, vertigo, paresthesias and seizures. Conclusion: Liposomal cytarabine administered intrathecally is effective treatment for CNS disease in children with relapsed acute leukemia/NHL with acceptable toxicity profile.
