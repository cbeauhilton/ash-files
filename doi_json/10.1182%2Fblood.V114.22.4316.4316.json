    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4316 Chimerism defines the amount of donor versus recipient hematopoiesis following allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT). PCR-based analyses of short tandem repeats (STRs) are commonly used and are accurate and applicable to allogeneic transplant recipients. These analyses are performed on peripheral blood and marrow aspirates, but it is not known if it is necessary to analyze both. We performed a retrospective analysis of 42 consecutive adult allogeneic SCT recipients at our institution with available chimerism studies. PCR and capillary electropheresis of microsatellite loci were performed at 30, 60, and 90 days after SCT on both unfractionated blood and unfractionated marrow aspirate. Full donor chimerism (FDC) was defined as 95% or greater donor chimerism. PCR analyses of STRs for chimerism performed on unfractionated blood did not differ from results obtained on unfractionated marrow aspirate at 30, 60, or 90 days post transplant (P<0.0001). Peripheral blood PCR-based chimerism analyses provide similar information as marrow aspirate analyses. Using peripheral blood alone saves the expense of an additional analysis on marrow aspirate and prevents an uncomfortable procedure. These findings provide unique results suggesting larger studies in the adult population are needed to further delineate the role of chimerism analyses following allogeneic SCT.
