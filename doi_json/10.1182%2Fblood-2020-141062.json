    "abstract_text": "The B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is an immunotherapy target selectively expressed on multiple myeloma cells (MM). Despite recent success of experimental BCMA CAR-T cell therapy, clinical remissions in MM are often short, in part due to low persistence of the BCMA CAR-T cells. Additionally, immunosuppressive factors, notably TGF-\u03b2, are known to be elevated in the peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment in the bone marrow of MM patients, potentially contributing to the lack of durability of CAR-T cell therapy. We aimed to develop a fully-human BCMA CAR with long-term persistence and functional resistance to the suppressive effects of TGF-\u03b2. Initially, two fully human single chain variable fragments (scFv) specific for BCMA, derived by biopanning of a yeast display human scFv library, were characterized in a CAR format. Each of the two scFvs was cloned into a lentiviral vector CAR backbone, comprised of the CD8 hinge and transmembrane domain, 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain and CD3\u03b6 signaling domain, and termed BCMA1 and BCMA2, respectively. BCMA2 and BCMA1 T cells, generated by lentiviral vector transduction of primary human T cells, exhibited high CAR expression at multiplicities of infection 10 to 40 (BCMA1: 64-81%; BCMA2: 84-94%), and consistently demonstrated potent cytotoxicity in an overnight co-culture with BCMA + MM cell lines RPMI-8226 and MM1.S, but not the BCMA - 293T cells. BCMA2 CAR showed robust proliferative capacity in response to repeated, long-term exposure to MM1.S target cells, concordant with the sustained CD4 T-cell subset and high IL-2 production during the course of repeated exposure to target cells. This is in contrast to BCMA1, that showed precipitous decrease in CD4 + T-cell subset upon co-culture with MM cells, resulting in a CAR T-cell population dominated by CD8 + T-cells. Furthermore, the BCMA2 demonstrated prolonged potency in clearing tumor cells compared to BCMA1, even after continuous 20-day exposure to target cells. This was further confirmed in a mouse intradermal RPMI-8226 xenograft tumor model, in which infusion of BCMA2 T-cells resulted in the rapid and complete eradication of tumors, while BCMA1 showed a slower decline in tumor burden. To further improve the efficacy of the BCMA2, specifically within the TGF-\u03b2-rich immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, we developed an armored BCMA2 CAR variant, which co-expresses the dominant negative TGF-\u03b2 RII bicistronically via a 2A sequence (BCMA2-TbnegCAR). In a 10 day-long co-culture assay with MM1.S targets in the presence of spiked 10 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2, BCMA2-TbnegCAR retained high proliferative capacity and potent cytotoxicity, while the unarmored BCMA2 had diminished proliferation and substantially reduced cytokine and granzyme B production. Consistently, in the in vivo intradermal tumor model that utilizes RPMI-8226, which is a MM cell line that endogenously produces TGF-\u03b2, we observed that BCMA2-TbnegCAR treatment resulted in higher T-cell counts in the tumors and an earlier decrease of tumor burden compared to infusion with BCMA2, further demonstrating the increased efficacy and potency of the BCMA2-TbnegCAR. In conclusion, we have designed and characterized a new fully-human BCMA2-TbnegCAR, with a novel scFv that exhibits robust proliferative capacity and persistent cytotoxicity, and remains functionally resistant to the immunosuppressive effects of TGF-\u03b2. This novel BCMA CAR can potentially improve the effectiveness and durability of the current BCMA CAR-T cell therapy.
