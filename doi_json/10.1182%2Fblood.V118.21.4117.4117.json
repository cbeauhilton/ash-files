    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4117 Related haploidentical donors, as cord blood, can be alternative donor sources in stem cell transplantation (SCT). Severe GVHD, however, has interfered the progress of haploidentical SCT (haploSCT). To deal with this strong GVHD, T cell depletion has usually been used in US and European countries. In order to pursue the controllable GVL effect by T cells, we have performed unmanipulated haploSCT using myeloablative or reduced intensity preconditioning regimen accompanied with intensified GVHD prophylaxis, including steroids. In this meeting, we will summarize our experience of haploSCT for more than ten years. From August 1998 to September 2010, we have performed 351 cases of haploSCT (all cases were HLA 2\u20133 antigen mismatched in GVH direction). Patients' characteristics are sex: male 186, female 168, age: 16\u201365 years old (median 39), disease: AML/MDS 149, ALL 81, ML 67, others 54. Eighty-three percent of cases underwent SCT in non-complete remission (non-CR) status. Patients under 45 years old underwent myeloablative preconditioning regimen consisting of FLU/CA/CY/TBI 8Gy (haplo-full, n=100), and patients over 45 years old or with comorbidities or repetitive SCT (including second to fifth SCT) underwent reduced intensity preconditioning regimen consisting of FLU/(CA)/BU/ATG or FLU/(CA)/MEL/ATG (haplo-mini, n=251). High dose Ara-C (CA) was optional to reduce tumor burden. As ATG, ATG (Fresenius) 8mg/kg, or thymoglubulin (genzyme) 2\u20134mg/kg were integrated into conditioning treatments mainly for reduced-intensity transplantation. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of taclolimus (TAC), methylprednisolone (mPSL) 2mg/kg/day, short term MTX, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 15mg/kg/day in haplo-full, and TAC, and mPSL 1mg/kg/day in haplo-mini, respectively. For elderly patients over 50 years old in haplo-mini, MMF was added. Hematopoietic engraftment in haploSCT was as rapid as that in HLA-identical SCT, except 10 cases of graft rejection. The median time to reach a neutrophil account of >0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /l was 10 days for haplo-mini and 13 days for haplo-full. Platelet recovery was achieved in 66 % and 60% of patients undergoing haplo-mini and haplo-full, respectively. The median time to reach a nontransfused platelet count of 3 20 \u00d7 10 9 /l was 22 days for haplo-mini and 33 days for haplo-full. Sixty percent of haplo-mini patients and 54 % of haplo-full patients did not develop acute GVHD. Acute GVHD (grade II-IV) was observed in 20% for haplo-mini and 36 % for haplo-full. Overall survival at five years was 30% for haplo-full and 40% for haplo-mini, respectively. If limited to CR cases, overall survival reached over 60% in haplo-mini. There is no difference in survival rate among patients' diseases. In multivariate analysis on survival using variables, including disease status before transplantation, haplo-full vs haplo-mini, mismatches in GVH direction, mismatches in HVG direction, patients' age, and the number of transplantation times, the disease status (CR) was found to be only a significantly favorable factor (P= 0.0026). Unmanipulated haploSCT is feasible and effective for refractory diseases. ATG dose used in haplo-mini is critical, and rather low compared with that of European cases reported so far. Although it should be too early to refer long term outcome, unmanipulated haploSCT could be considered as an option to control refractory diseases.
