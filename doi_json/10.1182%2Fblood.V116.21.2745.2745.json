    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2745 Background: The influence of cytogenetic abnormalities on the prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been well-documented; however, the relative impact of certain miscellaneous abnormalities remains controversial. Recently, monosomal karyotype-based risk stratification has been shown to further discriminate the prognosis within the poor-risk karyotype group (Breems et al. JCO 2008), but this finding requires further validation. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 779 consecutive adult AML patients treated with standard induction chemotherapy, consisting of daunorubicin plus cytarabine (3+7), at our institution from 1998\u20132008. After excluding patients with favourable risk, normal, missing or failed karyotype, 290 patients remained and were included in the analysis. Results: The baseline characteristics of these 290 patients were as follows: median age 59 y (range 18\u201381), male 181, prior malignancy 110, median white cell count (WBC) 7.6 \u00d7 10^9/L (range 0\u2013246). The karyotypic features included single monosomy in 42, 2 or more monosomies in 51, and non-monosomy structural and numerical abnormalities in 197 patients. Of the 290, 116 (40 %) had three or more abnormalities (complex karyotype, CK). A total of 141 patients (49 %) achieved complete remission (CR) with 3+7 induction chemotherapy. Sixty-four patients received allogeneic stem cell transplantation in CR. The median overall survival (OS) for all patients was 12 months (95% CI: 10\u201314 months). The median OS was 10 (95% CI: 6\u201318), 7 (95% CI: 6\u201310) and 14 months (95% CI: 12\u201316) in the single monosomy, 2+ monosomy and non-monosomy groups, respectively (p < 0.0001 by log-rank test comparing the three groups). Among the patients containing at least one monosomy, the OS was not significantly different between the CK and non-CK groups (p = 0.08 by log rank). Similarly, in the non-monosomy structural abnormality group, the OS was not significantly different between the CK and non-CK groups (p = 0.2). Conclusions: Our results provide validation for the monosomal karyotype-based risk stratification for AML, indicating that patients with at least one monosomy have an inferior OS compared to other poor-risk non-monosomy groups. Within each of the monosomy and non-monosomy groups, the presence of a complex karyotype does not significantly influence the OS. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
