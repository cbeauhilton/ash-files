    "abstract_text": "Paired Immunoglobulin-like receptors of activating (PIR-A) and inhibitory (PIR-B) isoforms are expressed by many blood cell types including B cells, dendritic cells, monocyte/macrophages, granulocytes, mast cells and megakaryocyte/platelets. To determine the role of PIR-B in bacterial infection, PIR-B deficient (PIR-B \u2212/\u2212 ) and control C57BL/6 mice of the same age and sex were infected intravenously with the attenuated strain of Salmonella typhimurium (WB335). When injected with high doses of bacteria (5 \u00d7 10 4 \u223c 5 \u00d7 10 6 CFU), both types of mice died within 3 to 14 days post infection. When given small doses (10 3 \u223c 10 4 CFU), however, PIR-B \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited progressively increasing morbidity beginning at 4-day post-infection over a 4-week period, whereas many control mice could survive (see Figure). PIR-B \u2212/\u2212 mice were found to have higher bacterial loads in liver, spleen and lungs than the control mice and bacteremia at days 3 and 7 post-infection. In liver histology typhoid nodules were observed as early as day 1 and their incidence increased during the next six days in both groups of mice. However, quite distinct changes were observed at day 7: in control mice inflammatory cellular lesions were localized and exhibited nodular distribution, whereas in PIR-B \u2212/\u2212 mice mononuclear cells infiltrated along the liver sinusoids and exhibited a spreading distribution. There were no significant differences in plasma levels of liver enzymes (ATL, AST and ALK), cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL-10 and IFN\u03b3) and antibodies (IgM, IgG and IgA) against Salmonella between PIR-B \u2212/\u2212 and control mice. While splenic lymphoid and myeloid subsets were indistinguishable during the first week of infection, the increases of CD19 + B and CD8 + T cells in infected PIR-B \u2212/\u2212 mice were not as marked as those in infected control mice at day 14 post-infection (see Table). For phagocytic cell functions ex vivo , there were no differences in phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria and superoxide anion release between PIR-B \u2212/\u2212 and control mice. However, PIR-B \u2212/\u2212 macrophages were found to release more nitrite and TNF\u03b1 upon bacteria stimulation than the control macrophages. These results suggest that PIR-B plays an important regulatory role in bacterial infection. (Supported by NIH/NIAID grants AI42127 and AI52243).  . Mac-1 + M\u03a6 . CD4 + T . CD8 + T .
