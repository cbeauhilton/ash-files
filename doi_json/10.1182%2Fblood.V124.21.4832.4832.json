    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Conflicting evidence suggests a person who suffers an index pulmonary embolism (PE) is more likely to develop a recurrent PE than a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the proportion of recurrent events that will be PE in such people. METHODS: A literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL (through 7/2014) was performed to identify RCTs of acute treatment and prevention of recurrent VTE in persons suffering an index PE, enrolling \u226550 subjects, requiring anticoagulation for \u22653 months and reporting the proportion of recurrent events that were DVT or PE (\u00b1DVT). RCTs not in English, enrolling only cancer, surgical or thrombophilia patients, primary prevention and extended treatment trials were excluded. We extracted recurrent VTE event data; and used a random-effects approach to pool the proportion [along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] of recurrent events that were PE and fatal PE, as well as, the proportion of recurrent PEs that were fatal. RESULTS: Nine RCTs (n=13,606 subjects; 413 recurrent events) were included. In persons presenting with an index PE, 67%; 95%CI, 62-71% of their recurrent events were PE and 27%; 95%CI, 22-33%) were fatal PE. Of all recurrent PEs observed, 41%; 95%CI, 33-48% resulted in death. No statistical heterogeneity was observed in any analysis (I 2 <32% for all). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests a majority of recurrent events in those experiencing an index PE will be PEs. Moreover, recurrent PEs are associated with a high mortality rate. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
