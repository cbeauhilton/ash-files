    "abstract_text": "Macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1\u03b1) is a key factor in the pathogenesis of MM. MIP-1\u03b1 is a growth and survival factor for MM (Lentzsch et al., Blood 2003), stimulates osteoclast formation, increases adhesion of MM cells to stromal cells and induces bone resorption and lytic lesions in patients with MM (Choi et al., JCI 2001). High levels of MIP-1\u03b1 are present in the marrow of 70% of MM patients, and MIP-1\u03b1 levels correlate with increased bone destruction, tumor burden and a poor prognosis in MM patients (Uneda et al., Br J Haematol 2003). MIP-1\u03b1 binds to the chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5, which are expressed on myeloma cells as well as on osteoclasts. Therefore, targeting MIP-1\u03b1 mediated effects on myeloma cells as well as on osteoclasts by blocking its receptors is a novel target for treating the majority of MM patients. BX471 is a potent and selective antagonist of CCR1 that inhibits the binding of MIP-1\u03b1 to CCR1. BX471 inhibits OCL formation (Oba et al., Exp. Hematology 2005) and is currently being studied in phase II trials for multiple sclerosis. However it is unknown if BX471 effects all MM cells or only those MM cells that produce MIP-1\u03b1. Secretion of MIP-1\u03b1 of the MM cell lines (MM.1S, OPM 2, RPMI 8226) was measured by Bio-Plex Cytokine Assay. All cell lines were exposed to serial dilutions of BX 471 (10\u20131000 nM) for 48 hours and thymidine uptake was measured to assess inhibition of proliferation. CCR1 expression on MM cell lines was detected by PCR. All MM cell lines expressed CCR1. OPM 2 and MM.1S secreted high amounts of MIP-1\u03b1 within 48hours (2,032 pg/mL and 4,388 pg/mL, respectively). Secretion of MIP-1\u03b1 by RPMI 8226 MM cells was not detectable. Significant dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation by BX471 was seen with MM.1S and OPM 2 MM cells (40% and 46%, respectively). In contrast RPMI 8226, which did not secret MIP-1\u03b1 was not inhibited by BX 471 up to 1000 nM. These data show that blocking CCR1 induces significant growth inhibition of MIP-1\u03b1 producing MM cells and underscore the relevance of MIP-1\u03b1 as an important autocrine growth and survival factor in MM. This study provides the framework for clinical evaluation of BX 471 in a phase II trial for patients with MM and supports the hypothesis that BX471 targets both the tumor and osteoclastic activity in MIP-1\u03b1 producing MM cells and suggests that BX471 should be an effective treatment for the majority of MM patients.",
