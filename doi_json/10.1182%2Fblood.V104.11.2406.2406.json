    "abstract_text": "The importance of bone marrow angiogenesis in multiple myeloma (MM) provided the initial rationale for using thalidomide in this disease, given its anti-angiogenic properties. Thalidomide (\u03b1-N-[phthalimido] glutarimide, C 13 H 10 N 2 O 4 ), a glutamic acid derivative, has proved useful in the treatment of both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory MM, however, its potential for teratogenicity lays a huge burden on its use as a therapeutic agent. Ongoing efforts have been directed towards development of analogues, which retain anti-MM activity without teratogenic effects. A product of cytochrome P450 2C19 isozyme biotransformation of thalidomide, 5\u2032-OH-thalidomide, has been shown to be partly responsible for the anti-angiogenic effect of thalidomide. Based on the structure of this metabolite several N-substituted and tetraflourinated thalidomide analogues have been synthesized as potential anti-angiogenic agents and have shown pre-clinical activity in prostate cancer. In this study, we demonstrate potent anti-MM activity and delineate potential mechanisms of two such compounds, CPS11 (an N-substituted thalidomide) and CPS49 (a tetraflourinated thalidomide). Both CPS11 and CPS49 showed inhibition of proliferation of several MM cell lines as well as primary tumor cells from relapsed/refractory MM patients. These drugs had significant activity in myeloma cell lines resistant to conventional chemotherapy agents (dexamethasone, adriamycin, mitoxantrone and melphalan). Both the drugs were able to overcome the protective effects of growth factors like IL-6, IGF-1, and VEGF, and co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), demonstrating their activity against myeloma cells in conditions simulating the natural microenvironment. In most of the cytotoxicity experiments, CPS49 was more potent compared to CPS11. An additive cytotoxic effect was noted when these agents were combined with dexamethasone and melphalan. Apoptosis was noted in MM1.S cells as evidenced by annexin and PI staining and a time- and dose-dependent increase in cleavage of poly ADP-ribosepolymerase (PARP) and caspase-8. Additionally, Z-VAD-FMK partially blocked these effects. Importantly, apoptosis triggered by these drugs was associated with down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins like Mcl1 and XIAP. In matrigel based angiogenesis assays both drugs demonstrated anti-angiogenic activity, CPS49 being more potent than CPS11. To further delineate their molecular mechanism of actions, we evaluated the effect of these drugs on various intracellular signaling pathways known to be important in myeloma. Both the drugs were able inhibit the PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT pathways in MM1.S myeloma cells line. These encouraging in vitro data will provide the platform for testing these analogues initially in animal models and subsequently in the clinic.",
