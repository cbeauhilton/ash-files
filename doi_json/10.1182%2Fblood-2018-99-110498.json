    "abstract_text": "Leukemia is the most common malignant tumor in children under 15 years old, which is divided into several subtypes, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), based on the disease phases and effected cells. Each subtype has its specific molecular feature and key regulation factors. In our previous studies, we reported that \u03b2-arrestin1 (ARRB1), the pivotal scaffold protein to transduce various cellular signals, could bind with EZH2 to increase Bcr/Abl H4 acetylation level and thus promote CML progression ( Brit J Cancer 2014, 111(3): 568-76). ARRB1 could enhance DNMT1 activity and PTEN methylation, decrease PTEN expression and promote self-renew of B-ALL leukemia initiating cells (LICs) ( Cancer Lett 2015, 357(1): 170-8.). ARRB1 could increase P300 to bind with SP1 to hTERT promoter, and thus increase hTERT transcription/expression, telomerase activity, telomere length and cell senescence in B-ALL LICs ( Cell Death Diff 2017, 8(4): e2756.). However, little is known in the T-ALL, which about 70% have the mutations of NOTCH1 gene. Here, we unveil ARRB1 could curb the progression of T-ALL cells in vitro and in vivo , while the expression of ARRB1 was suppressed by the aberrant increased miR-223. Mechanistically, ARRB1 could recruit DTX1, the E3 ubiquitin ligase, to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of NOTCH1 protein in T-ALL. Furthermore, Overexpression of ARRB1-derived miR-223 sponge BUTR was incompatible with cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in T-ALL cells. Collectively, our results for the first time revealed that ARRB1 acted as a tumor suppressor by promoting NOTCH1 degradation in T-ALL cells where miR-223 effectively antagonized ARRB1 functions. This provides that miR-223 may serve as a valid drug target for developing novel and efficacious T-ALL therapeutics. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
