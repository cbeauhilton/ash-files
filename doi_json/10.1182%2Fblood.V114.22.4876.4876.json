    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4876 Background Recent studies have found obesity to be associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold elevated risk of developing multiple myeloma. This is of particular interest given that elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 have been found in obese persons, and, at the same time, IL-6 has well-known proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects on monoclonal plasma-cells. Also insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have been proposed to play a role since obesity often causes insulin resistance, which in turn modulates the bioavailability of IGF-1 Similar to IL-6, prior studies have found IGF-1 to have both growth and survival effects on monoclonal plasma-cells. Based on these facts, we have speculated that obesity might increase the risk of the multiple myeloma precursor monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), or, alternatively, that obesity may increase the risk for transformation from MGUS to multiple myeloma. We conducted the first large screening study designed to assess the association between obesity and MGUS among almost 2,000 African-American and Caucasian women. Methods We included 1000 African-American and 996 Caucasian women (age 40-79, median 48 years) from the Southern Community Cohort Study to assess MGUS risk in relation to obesity. Per our sampling strategy, about 50% of the participants were obese. Medical record-abstracted weight and height (measured on the day of study enrollment) and self-reported values had very high concordance (Pearson correlation >0.95). Serum samples from all subjects were analyzed by electrophoresis performed on agarose gel; samples with a discrete or localized band were subjected to immunofixation. Using logistic regression models, we estimated odds ratios (ORs) as measures of risk. Results Among all study participants, 39 (3.9%) African-Americans and 21 (2.1%) Caucasians were found to have MGUS, yielding a 1.9-fold (95%CI 1.1-2.3; p=0.021) higher risk of MGUS among African-Americans (vs. Caucasians). On multivariate analysis, we found obesity (OR=1.8, 95%CI 1.03-3.1; p=0.039), African-American race (OR=1.8, 95%CI 1.04-3.1; p=0.037), and increasing age (quartiles: \u226555 vs. <43 years) (OR=2.5, 95%CI 1.1-5.7; p=0.028) to be independently associated with an excess risk of MGUS. Another interesting finding was that the distribution of the monoclonal immunoglobulin isotype usage among African-American and Caucasian women was significantly different (p=0.007). Their respective rates were: IgG in 79.5% and 71.3 %; IgA in 7.7% and 0%; IgM in 7.7% and 19%; biclonal in 5.1% and 4.7%; and triclonal in 0% and 4.7%. The distribution of serum light-chain types between the two races was also significantly different (P=0.003, chi-square test): kappa in 53.8% and 47.6%; lambda in 43.6% and 42.8%; biclonal 2.6% and 4.7%; and triclonal in 0% and 4.7%. Conclusions Our finding that MGUS is twice as common among obese (vs. non-obese) women, and independent of race, supports the hypothesis that obesity is etiologically linked to myelomagenesis and may have public health impact. The observed 2-fold excess of MGUS among African-Americans (vs. Caucasians) of similar socio-economic status, coupled with other recent studies supports a role for susceptibility genes as the cause for racial disparity in the prevalence of MGUS.
