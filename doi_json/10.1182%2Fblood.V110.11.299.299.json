    "abstract_text": "Background: Pgp expression in AML increases with age and correlates with inferior therapeutic response and survival. Zosuquidar is a potent and highly specific Pgp inhibitor with minimal pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction with conventional xenobiotic antineoplastics. Prolonged Pgp blockade is believed necessary to optimize antineoplastic sensitization in resistant cells in vitro . We previously reported that 72-hour CIV Zosuquidar at 700 mg/d resulted in rapid and sustained Pgp inhibition during the entire period of anthracycline administration in Pgp+ AML (Lancet, et al. ASH 2006). Methods: We report interim results from a Phase I/II trial of 72-hr CIV zosuquidar in older adults with newly diagnosed Pgp+ AML. Primary objective: to determine the response (CR + CRp) rate in Pgp+ patients. Eligibility included ages 55\u201375, ECOG PS 0-2, adequate end-organ function, and Pgp+ by functional assay. Zosuquidar was initiated 4 hrs prior to the first doses of DNR (45 mg/m 2 /d x 3d) and ARA-C (100 mg/m 2 /d CIV x 7d) and continued for 72 hrs. Reinduction with the same dosing schedule was permitted in patients with significant cytoreduction without aplasia. Patients who achieved a CR/CRp received up to 2 cycles of consolidation with the same agents using an abbreviated schedule. Results: 67 patients with Pgp+ AML were enrolled on the study; 80 patients were included in the safety analysis. Sixty-two of the 67 Pgp+ patients received Zosuquidar at 700 mg/day, while 5 received 800 mg/day (during phase I). Median age was 66; M/F was 46/21; cytogenetics: adverse (19), intermediate (29), and unknown/not done (19); de novo /secondary AML: 36/31. Mean percentage of planned Zosuquidar actually administered was 94%. CR/CRp was achieved in 32 of 66 (48%) evaluable Pgp+ patients (CR=25, CRp=7). Fifteen of 31 (48%) patients with secondary AML, and 6 of 19 (32%) with adverse-risk cytogenetics achieved CR/CRp. Eight of 14 (57%) patients age \u2265 70 responded. Induction-related death (< 30 days) occurred in 10% of patients. Other common toxicities included infection/febrile neutropenia (89%), tremor (42%), hallucinations (11%), nausea (52%), and diarrhea (51%). Median times to neutrophil (\u2265 1000/\u03bcL) and platelet (\u2265 100,000/\u03bcL) recovery were 34 and 33 days, respectively. With a median followup of 7.5 months, the median overall survival was 8.9 months and the median relapse-free survival was 9.3 months. Conclusions: CIV Zosuquidar 700 mg/d with DNR and ARA-C is well tolerated, with signs of clinical benefit in poor-risk older patients with Pgp+ AML, warranting continued study of this combination. Accrual to the current trial is ongoing."
