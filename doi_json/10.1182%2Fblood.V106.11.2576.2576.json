    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Disease manifestations in myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) that require therapy include anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms. We have previously reported on the therapeutic value of low-dose thalidomide in combination with prednisone for the treatment of both anemia and thrombocytopenia in MMM ( Blood  2003 ; 101 : 2534 ), and of etanercept (tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonist) for alleviation of constitutional symptoms ( Blood  2002 ; 99 (6): 2252 ). In the current study, we investigated the value of combining all three drugs (PET). METHODS: Study eligibility criteria included a histologically confirmed diagnosis of MMM and either severe anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL) or symptomatic splenomegaly. Protocol treatment was initiated with 50 mg of oral thalidomide (THAL) daily, etanercept (ETAN) 25 mg subcutaneously twice-a-week, and a three month prednisone taper starting at 0.5 mg/kg/day for the first month followed by a 50% reduction for the second months and a further 50% reduction for the third and final month of treatment with prednisone. Patients with a demonstrable clinical response after three months were able to remain on thalidomide and etanercept. RESULTS: 15 patients were enrolled to the trial (median age 66 years, range, 54\u201377; 14 males). Twelve patients (80%) completed the planned three cycles (i.e. 3 months) of treatment (progression (n=2) and patient choice (n=1) accounted for the withdrawals), nine (60%) patients with evidence of response continued on an additional three months of THAL/ETAN alone (of which 3 progressed prior to study completion). At enrollment, 11 patients (73%) were anemic (7 (47%) were red cell transfusion dependent), 7 (47%) were at least moderately thrombocytopenic (platelet count < 100 x 10 9 //L), and 6 had severe constitutional symptoms (night sweats or disease related fever). Anemia response were seen in 6 (of the 11 eligible; 54%) patients (2 in the non-transfusion dependent (sustained increases of 1.5 and 4.9 g/dL hemoglobin); 4 in transfusion dependent (1 transfusion independent, 3 >50% decrease in transfusion requirements)). All thrombocytopenic patients experienced an increase in platelet counts (median 55% increase (range(10\u2013229) with 2 returning to the normal range (>150 x 10 9 /L)). A greater than 50% decrease in organomegaly was documented in 3 patients with splenomegaly (25% of eligible), and 1 patient with hepatomegaly (25%). Constitutional symptoms resolved, or signifcantly improved in all afflicted. Therapy overall was well tolerated with the majority of toxicities being transient. Neuropathy (grade 1; n=3; grade 2; n=1) and hyperglycemia (grade 2; n=1) were minimal. The only greater or equal to grade 3 toxicities were (grade 3: elevated bilirubin, infection, and blurred vision; grade 4: anemia). Follow-up bone marrow examination, when available, did not show post-treatment histological changes. CONCLUSIONS: This phase II study of combination therapy with thalidomide-prednisone-etanercept in patients with MMM confirms the previously recognized value of etanercept in alleviating constitutional symptoms. However, the PET regimen does not appear to be superior to thalidomide-prednisone combination in terms of therapeutic value for anemia, thrombocytopenia, or splenomegaly.",
