    "abstract_text": "We conducted a phase II trial with alemtuzumab self-administered, subcutaneously (SQ) to eliminate residual disease after chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy for patients (pts) who were in partial remission (PR) or pts in complete remission (CR) with 2-color flow cytometry evidence of disease. Pts received alemtuzumab SQ 3mg, 10mg, 30mg on days 1,2,3 then 30mg thrice weekly for a total of 12 doses, including rampup. After the 12th dose, pts with residual disease could receive a second course of 12 additional doses. Responding pts were pts in PR who converted to nodular PR (NPR) or CR by NCI-WG \u201896 criteria or pts in CR who remained in CR and had no evidence of disease by 2-color flow cytometry. There were 26 pts enrolled in PR, 5 pts in CR. 7 pts received a second course of alemtuzumab. End of treatment plasma alemtuzumab levels were measured by a flow cytometry-based assay (Rebello and Hale, J Immunol Methods, 2002). The response rate in the intent-to-treat population was 74%. We retrospectively evaluated patients\u2019 bone marrow for minimal residual disease by 4-color flow cytometry. A disappointing 18% of pts evaluated was MRD-negative in bone marrow by this method. Responding pts had mean plasma alemtuzumab level of 8\u03bcg/ml verses 3\u03bcg/ml for non-responders (p=.003). The median plasma alemtuzumab level for responders was 6\u03bcg/ml. Responders with end of treatment plasma alemtuzumab level greater than 6\u03bcg/ml had a significantly longer median response duration of 21.2 months versus 8.9 months for pts with less than 6\u03bcg/ml (p=.048). End of treatment plasma alemtuzumab level correlated with response to treatment and response duration for patients treated with alemtuzumab SQ. Future studies to optimize dose and schedule for alemtuzumab SQ as treatment for CLL, including for residual disease, should include measurement of end of treatment plasma alemtuzumab levels and evaluation of bone marrow for minimal residual disease by 4-color flow cytometry. Furthermore, consideration of these results should be given to optimize the effective duration of treatment with alemtuzumab SQ."
