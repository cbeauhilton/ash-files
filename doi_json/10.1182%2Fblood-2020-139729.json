    "abstract_text": "Objectives: To explore the efficacy and safety of high-dose cytarabine combined with PD-1 inhibitors and demethylation drugs in relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R-AML) in China and to investigate the dynamic changes of Treg cells, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, TNF-\u03b1, INF-\u03b3, and IL-6 in the prognosis of the disease. Methods: A total of three patients with R/R-AML treated in our department were included in the study. None of the three patients had received at least two courses of standard chemotherapy before and did not obtain remission . The cellular immunity and cytokines were evaluated on the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd day of the treatment. In the study , eligible R/ R-AML patients (n=3) were treated with azacytidine 75mg/m 2 d1-d7, cytarabine 2g/m 2 d1-d5, PD-1 inhibitor 200mg d1\u3001d14. The efficacy were evaluated by CR, PR, ORR, PFS, OS, and ED. The safety were evaluated by hematological and non-hematological toxicity. Results: Among the three patients, one patient achieved CR, and one patient achieved PR. The patient who achieved CR successfully underwent allo - HSCT . One patient did not achieve remission and died of disease progression. Three patients were well tolerated to chemotherapy, and non-hematological toxicity was mainly respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal reaction, and liver function damage. At present, n o immune-related tissue injury was observed. Grade III-IV hematologic toxicity was the major adverse reaction, and the longest duration of agranulocytosis was 22 days. The proportion of Treg cells decreased, and the proportion of CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T lymphocytes increased in 2 patients after treatment. One patient received CR and underwent allo - HSCT . One patient showed an increase in the proportion of Treg cells, but there was no significant dynamic change in CD4 + T lymphocytes and CD8 + T lymphocytes. INF-\u03b3 increased in 1 patient. Dynamic changes in IL-10, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 were not observed. Conclusions: PD-1 inhibitor combined with high dose cytarabine based chemotherapy may be a salvage treatment for R/R-AML. The dynamic changes of CD4 + T lymphocyte, CD8 + T lymphocyte, Treg cell, and INF-\u03b1 may reflect the therapeutic effect in advance. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
