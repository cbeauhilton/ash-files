    "abstract_text": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the presence of the Philidelphia chromosome which encodes for the fusion protein bcr-abl, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis) is an inhibitor of the kinase activity of bcr-abl and therefore a treatment modality for CML. High rates of cytogenetic responses are found, although in many patients minimal residual disease (MRD) is detected by molecular techniques. Immunotherapy using leukemic dendritic cell (DC) based vaccination might be a feasible approach to eradicate MRD. In a pilot study on CML-DC-based vaccination in advanced CML DTH responses towards CML cells were achieved. ( Ossenkoppele et al., Leukemia , 2003 , 17 , 1424 ). However, little is known about the effects of Imatinib mesylate on bcr-abl positive CML-DC during vaccination. In this study we investigated effects of Imatinib on culture of CML-DC, their viability, T cell stimulating and migratory capacity in vitro in 17 patients. Imatinib hardly affected the immunophenotypical profile of CML-DC. Expression of CD40, CD80, CD83, HLA-DR and chemokine receptors (CCR5, CCR7, CXCR4) remained stable during overnight exposure. Only the fluorescence intensity of CD86 was significantly higher (1\u201310\u03bcM, p =0.043) and that of CD54 significantly decreased in the highest Imatinib concentration tested ( p =0.043). Exposure of Imatinib-free cultured CML-DC to Imatinib significantly reduced the recovery of viable cells and hence the DC yield in a dose-dependent manner (5.3\u201326% reduction after 20h. for 1\u201310\u03bcM, p =0.043). Migration of mature CML-DC towards CCL19 (MIP3\u03b2) was significantly improved in the presence of 1 and 5\u03bcM Imatinib which implies increased ability to reach the lymph nodes ( p =0.043, mean 27, 36 and 34% migration for 0, 1 and 5\u03bcM Imatinib, respectively). Imatinib did not affect T cell stimulating capacity of CML-DC, except at concentrations higher than 3\u03bcM ( p =0.028). No significant changes were observed for Imatinib exposure of CD34 + DC isolated from normal subjects. In conclusion, Imatinib at low concentrations maintains the immunogenecity of CML-DC. Since Imatinib plasma levels in CML patients are 1.5 and 3.0\u03bcM upon 400 and 800mg daily, respectively, our data justify continuation of Imatinib treatment during CML-DC-based vaccination regimens.",
