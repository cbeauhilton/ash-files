    "abstract_text": "Patients with chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have been found to have high titers of allo-reactive antibodies, but a role for B cells in the pathology of this disease remains undefined. B Cell Activating Factor, BAFF/Blys (BAFF), promotes differentiation and expansion of antigen-activated B cells and contributes to loss of B cell tolerance in animal models. We hypothesized that the BAFF/BAFF receptor (BAFF-R) pathway may perpetuate potentially allo- or auto-reactive antigen-experienced CD27+ B cells in patients with cGVHD after HSCT. Soluble BAFF was measured in plasma from 104 patients after HSCT. Median BAFF levels were statistically different when groups were compared using a two-sided Wilcoxon-Rank-Sum test (see Table below). Logistic regression analysis revealed that higher BAFF levels were associated with active cGVHD after adjusting for other GVHD prognostic factors (p=0.0007). Patients with \u226510ng/ml BAFF levels had ten-fold increased odds of having cGVHD compared to patients with BAFF levels of 10ng/ml at 6 months subsequently developed cGVHD (median BAFF was 20ng/ml) compared to 39% of patients with BAFF levels <10ng/ml at 6 months (p=0.002). We also found that BAFF-R expression on B cells was down-regulated in vitro in the presence of BAFF. Consistent with this finding flow cytometry revealed very low BAFF-R expression on B cells in patients with active cGVHD. BAFF-R expression on peripheral B cells correlated with BAFF levels (p=0.0001), suggesting that BAFF signals via BAFF-R in cGVHD. We used 5-color FACS to characterize peripheral B cell subsets in 68 post-HSCT patients. Compared to patients without cGVHD, the proportion of antigen-experienced CD27+ B cells was increased in patients with limited cGVHD (n=20, p=0.04). The extensive cGVHD patient group was smaller (n=11) with greater variability in CD27+ B cell frequency resulting in no statistical difference (p=0.27). The proportion of CD27+ post-germinal center B cells was also increased in patients with active cGVHD (p=0.04 and p=0.03 extensive and limited cGVHD, respectively). High BAFF levels correlated with increased total numbers of CD27+ B cells (p=0.05), but not with total or nai\u0308ve B cell numbers, suggesting that BAFF plays a role in perpetuation of circulating antigen-experienced and memory B cells in cGVHD patients. Our results suggest that high levels of BAFF after HSCT help break peripheral B cell tolerance and contribute to cGVHD pathobiology.
