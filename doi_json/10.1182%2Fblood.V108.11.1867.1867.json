    "abstract_text": "Several groups recently reported on the significance of small numbers of blasts (CNS2; WBC \u22645\u00d710 6 /l with morphological blasts) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as on traumatic lumbar puncture (TLP+; >10 eyrthrocytes \u00d710 6 /l, with blasts). In general, CNS2 does not have poor prognostic significance, whereas TLP+ does. We retrospectively analysed the prognostic influence of CSF involvement in DCOG ALL-9, which was highly dexamathasone (DEX) driven. The induction consisted of 3 drugs with DEX 6 mg/m 2 , followed by 3 MTX courses 2 g/m 2 (4 \u00d7 3 gr/m 2 for high-risk (HR) patients), and maintenance with DEX/vincristine and 6-MP/MTX blocks. 13 intrathecal triples (ITH) were given as CNS-prophylaxis. HR-patients (29%) received anthracyclines in induction and 2 extra intensification courses. CNS3 patients (WBC >5\u00d710 6 with blasts) received additional ITH, and in case of persistent blasts after 4 ITH also irradiation. CSF at diagnosis was sent on culture medium to the DCOG for analysis. Classification was based on morphology, or TdT for CNS1 (WBC \u22645\u00d710 6 /l and no blasts) and CNS2. 859 patients (1\u201318 years) were enrolled; of 139 no CSF was received; hence we report on 720 patients. Median age was 5 years; WBC 10.4\u00d710 9 /l; 61% boys; 83% B-cell precursor ALL, 10% T-ALL, 7% unknown; 1.6% BCR-ABL, 0.1% MLL-AF4, 21% TEL-AML, 22% hyperdiploid. Based on morphology, 43% was CNS1, 41% CNS2, 1.9% CNS3, 11.3% TLP+ and 2.6% TLP\u2212(ery\u2019s>10\u00d710 6 /l without blasts). Frequencies with TdT were similar, but of the 201 patients with morphological CNS1, 30 (15%) were TdT positive; and of 259 patients with morphological CNS2, 121 (47%) were TdT positive (p50\u00d710 9 /l: 34 vs 21%; p=0.014). pEFS for CNS1 and -2 utilizing TdT-staining did not differ (82 vs. 80%, p=0.87), nor did the CIR. Combined morphology and TdT-data did not have prognostic significance (p=0.53). In conclusion: a) TLP+ is an independent risk factor, even on a highly DEX based regimen, and is related to high WBC; b) the incidence of CNS2 in this study was relatively high; c) there was a trend for poor outcome for CNS2 with longer follow-up; d) there is a discrepancy between morphological and TdT-based CSF classification for CNS1 and -2, but morphology seems superior for prognostification. Poor outcome for TLP+ patients has now been documented in several studies using different treatment regimens. Future studies should show whether intensified CNS-directed treatment is able to reduce the 7% CIR involving the CNS in TLP+ patients."
