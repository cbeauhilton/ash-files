    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a life-threatening bone marrow malignancy with a relapse rate near 50% in children, despite aggressive chemotherapy. Accumulating evidence shows that the bone marrow stromal environment protects a subset of leukemia cells and allows them to survive chemotherapy, eventually leading to recurrence. The factors that contribute to stroma-induced chemotherapy resistance are largely undetermined in AML. Our goal is to delineate the mechanisms underlying stroma-mediated chemotherapy resistance in human AML cells. We used two human bone marrow stromal cell lines, HS-5 and HS-27A, to study stroma-induced chemotherapy resistance. Both stromal cell lines are equally effective in protecting AML cell lines and primary samples from apoptosis induced by chemotherapy agents, including mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine. By gene expression profiling using the Affymetrix U133Plus 2 platform, we previously found that CYR61 was among the genes that were commonly upregulated in AML cells by both stromal cell lines. CYR61 is a secreted matricellular protein that is expressed at relatively low levels by AML cells, and at higher levels by stromal cells. CYR61 binds and activates integrins and enhances growth factor signaling in AML cells, and it has been associated with chemoresistance in other malignancies. Our current data provide functional evidence for a role for this protein in stroma-mediated chemoresistance in AML. First, we added anti-CYR61 neutralizing immunoglobulin (Ig), or control IgG, to AML-stromal co-cultures, treated with chemotherapy for 24 hours, and measured apoptosis with Annexin V staining and flow cytometry. In THP-1+HS-27A co-cultures treated with 50 nM mitoxantrone, the apoptosis rate was 33.0 \u00b1 3.7% with anti-CYR61 Ig v. 16.3 \u00b1 4.2% with control IgG; p=0.0015). Next, we knocked down CYR61 in the HS-5 and HS-27A stromal cell lines by lentiviral transduction of two individual shRNA constructs, and confirmed knockdown (KD) at the gene and protein levels for both cell lines. These CYR61-KD stromal cells provided significantly less protection for co-cultured AML cells treated with mitoxantrone, compared to stromal cells transduced with the non-silencing control. For example, the apoptosis rate for THP-1 cells co-cultured with CYR61-KD HS-27A cells was 10.8 \u00b1 0.8%, compared to 6.8 \u00b1 1.1% for THP-1 cells co-cultured with control HS-27A cells (p=0.02). Similar results were obtained with NB-4 AML cells. These results demonstrate that CYR61 contributes to stroma-mediated chemoresistance. CYR61 binds to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (Kireeva, et al, J. Biol. Chem., 1998, 273:3090), and this integrin activates spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) (Miller, et al, Cancer Cell, 2013, 24:45). Using intracellular flow cytometry, we found that activated Syk (pSyk) increased in THP-1 and NB-4 cell lines, and in primary AML patient samples, upon exposure to control HS-27A cells. In primary samples, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for pSyk averaged 11.7 \u00b1 1.3 in co-culture v. 6.6 \u00b1 0.6 for cells cultured alone (p=0.004, n=10). In contrast, pSyk did not significantly increase in AML cells co-cultured with CYR61-KD HS-27A cells (MFI for primary patient samples: 8.6 \u00b1 0.8). This result implicates Syk as a downstream signaling mediator of CYR61. To determine the role of CYR61-induced Syk signaling in chemotherapy resistance, we treated AML-stromal cell co-cultures with 3 uM R406, a potent Syk inhibitor, or DMSO, then added 300 nM mitoxantrone, and measured apoptosis after 24 hours. In AML cells co-cultured with control HS-27A cells, mitoxantrone-induced apoptosis was significantly increased by Syk inhibition (THP-1 cells: 13.7 \u00b1 0.7% with R406 v. 10.0 \u00b1 0.3% with DMSO, p<0.05), consistent with reduced chemoresistance. Notably, R406 did not further increase mitoxantrone-induced apoptosis in AML cells co-cultured with CYR61-KD HS-27A stromal cells (THP-1 cells: 15.7 \u00b1 0.2% with R406 v. 16.9 \u00b1 0.4% with DMSO). Similar results were seen with NB-4 cells, as well. These results support the notion that CYR61 signals through the integrin-Syk pathway to protect AML cells from chemotherapy. Therefore, the CYR61 - integrin - Syk pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for overcoming stroma-induced chemotherapy resistance in AML.
