    "abstract_text": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have been shown to elicit immunosuppressive effect on allogeneic lymphocyte response. However, MSCs are heterogeneous and data on the inhibitory abilities of different MSC subsets are lacking. In the present study, we selected Stro-1 + cells from human bone marrow and evaluated the inhibitory capability of this MSC subset in mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) or in mitogen stimulation asssays, in comparison to that of Stro-1 \u2212 cells. To evaluate the two MSC subsets for immunomodulation in vitro, we added 1,000\u201330,000 Stro-1 + or Stro-1 \u2212 cells to MLR at the beginning of the experiment. When comparing the inhibitory effects of the two subsets, PBLs proliferation was significantly more inhibited by Stro-1 + MSCs (11.0%\u201363.7%) than by stro-1 \u2212 MSCs (35.5%-106%) (P<0.01). Furthermore, as few as 1,000 Stro-1 + MSC could inhibit lymphocyte proliferation more effectively than 10 times more (10,000 cells) Stro-1 \u2212 cells. As it was observed with the mixed lymphocyte reaction, suppression of the response to the mitogen also occurred in a dose dependent fashion, but to a lesser extent with the Stro-1 \u2212 cells (25.5%\u201380.1% vs 7.5%\u201338.4% in Stro-1 + cells) (P<0.05). To investigate whether the difference of suppressive effect that we observed between Stro-1 + and Stro-1 \u2212 cells, still exist when MSC subsets are separated physically from PBL, we performed MLR in the upper chamber of a transwell and we seeded the lower chamber either with Stro-1 + or Stro-1 \u2212 cells. The inhibitory effect of Stro-1 + cells was significantly more profound than the one observed when Stro-1 \u2212 cells were used in the Transwell culture system (p<0.05) (Figure 3), demonstrating that one or several soluble factors was involved in production of different suppressive effects. Cytokine and chemokine genes, IL-10, TGF-\u03b21, SDF-1, SCF and IL-6 expression were evaluated in both MSC subsets by quantitative RT-PCR. Low levels of IL-6, SCF, SDF-1 were observed in Stro-1 + , which induced a fold increase around 1 (0,96 \u00b1 0,32; 0,96 \u00b1 0,24; 0,96 \u00b1 0,24), indicating that there is no signifiant difference of these genes expression between the two MSC subsets. However, we observed in Stro-1 + a decreased gene expression for IL-10 (0,24 fold \u00b1 0,59; p <0,05) and for TGF b1 (0,43 fold \u00b1 0,32; p <0,05). This finding suggested that the candidate T-cell inhibitory factors TGF b1, IL-10, which are lower expressed in Stro-1 + cells, are not responsible for the more profound inhibition of immunoreactivity by Stro-1 + cells. We show here that significant differences do exist within these two subsets. Stro-1 + cells inhibit lymphocyte proliferation significantly more profoundly than Stro-1 \u2212 cells. The difference is in part mediated by soluble factors, but not IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21. These results point to the notion that Stro-1 + cells can elicit more powerful immunosuppressive ability and a pre-selection of Stro-1 + MSC for clinical use may be advisable. These findings suggest that pre-selection of MSC before clinical use might produce more effective immunosuppression in different therapeutic applications, especially in clinics for the prevention of graft versus host disease (GVHD).",
