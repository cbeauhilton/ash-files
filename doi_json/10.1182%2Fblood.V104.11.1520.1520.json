    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Disease manifestations in myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) that require therapy include anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms. We have previously reported on the therapeutic value of low-dose thalidomide in combination with prednisone for the treatment of both anemia and thrombocytopenia in MMM ( Blood  2003 ; 101 : 2534 ) and of etanercept (tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonist) for alleviation of constitutional symptoms ( Blood  2002 ; 99 (6): 2252 ). In the current study, we investigated the value of combining all three drugs (PET). METHODS: Study eligibility criteria included a histologically confirmed diagnosis of MMM and either severe anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL) or symptomatic splenomegaly. Protocol treatment was initiated with 50 mg of oral thalidomide daily, etanercept 25 mg subcutaneously twice-a-week, and a three month prednisone taper starting at 0.5 mg/kg/day for the first month followed by a 50% reduction for the second months and a further 50% reduction for the third and final month of treatment with prednisone. Patients with a demonstrable clinical response after three months were able to remain on thalidomide and etanercept. RESULTS: To date 12 patients have been enrolled to the trial (median age 67 years, range, 54\u201377; 11 males). At enrollment, all patients were severely anemic (6 were red cell transfusion dependent), 6 were at least moderately thrombocytopenic (platelet count < 100 x 10 9/ /L), and 4 had severe constitutional symptoms. The responses to date included resolution of constitutional symptoms in all 4 pertinent patients, a 12\u2013326% improvement in thrombocytopenia in 4 of 6 pertinent patients, and anemia response in 4 patients including one patient who became red cell transfusion independent. A more than 50% decrease in splenomegaly was documented in 3 patients. Only one patient experienced greater or equal to grade 3 toxicity (i.e. elevated bilirubin and infection). Follow-up bone marrow examination, when available, did not show post-treatment histological changes. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary findings from the current ongoing phase II study of combination therapy with thalidomide-prednisone-etanercept in patients with MMM confirms the previously recognized value of etanercept in alleviating constitutional symptoms. However, at least preliminarily the PET regimen does not appear to be superior to thalidomide-prednisone combination in terms of therapeutic value for anemia, thrombocytopenia, or splenomegaly.",
