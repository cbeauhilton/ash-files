    "abstract_text": "Abstract 835 The establishment of the thymic microenvironment early in life is crucial for the production functional T cells. Conversely, thymic involution results in a decreased T cell output. Thymic involution has important health implications especially following bone marrow transplant. Our objective is to determine molecular and cellular mechanisms that will allow for regeneration of involuted thymic tissue, restore production of nai\u0308ve T cells, and improve immune function while improving our understanding of immunobiology. In this pursuit, we have focused on the Retinoblastoma family of tumor suppressor proteins. The main function of the RB pathway is to restrict passage through the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. RB and its two family members, p107 and p130, mediate the action of a broad range of cellular signals to control the proliferation, survival, and differentiation status of a large number of mammalian cell types. We found that inactivation of the RB pathway in the thymus by early deletion of RB family genes prevents thymic involution, promotes expansion of functional thymic epithelial cells (TECs), and increases thymic T cell output. Moreover, we have identified a direct regulatory relationship between RB and the Foxn1 transcription factor Via E2F transcription factors, where RB/E2F complexes directly repress the Foxn1 promoter, thereby promoting involution. Thus, the RB family is a critical mediator of extra- and intra-cellular signals to regulate thymic epithelial cells and thymus function, and decreasing RB pathway function may promote regeneration of the involuted thymus and restoration of nai\u0308ve T cell production in patients.
