    "abstract_text": "The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of many malignancies and is an important regulator of cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and the stress response. Free circulating proteasomes have been reported in the plasma and sera of cancer patients. We measured proteasome peptidase activity in the plasma of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and correlated these findings with clinical behaviour. Plasma samples from apparently healthy volunteers (n = 92) and patients in the chronic (n = 104) or accelerated/blast phase (n = 56) of CML were analysed with fluorogenic kinetic assays. Using peptide-AMC (7-amino-4-methylcoumaran) substrates, we measured the three reported proteasome enzymatic activities: chymotrypsin-like (Ch-L), trypsin-like (Tr-L), and caspase-like (Cas-L). All proteasome activities were significantly higher in CML patients than in healthy volunteers. Extensive characterization of proteasome activities revealed correlations between levels or ratios of specific peptidase activities and disease phase, progression, aggressiveness, and survival. High Ch-L activity correlated with shorter survival in both CP (P=0.037) and Acc/Bl phase (P=0.047). Patients in CP and a ratio of Cas-L: Tr-L activity >1.48 had significantly shorter survival (P=0.03). Cas-L: Tr-L activity ratio was predictor of survival in Acc/Bl patients as a continuous variable. These findings suggest that proteasome activity in the plasma of CML patients reflects disease activity and can be used as a biomarker for predicting clinical behavior. Studies exploring the role of proteasome inhibitors in CML are therefore warranted.",
