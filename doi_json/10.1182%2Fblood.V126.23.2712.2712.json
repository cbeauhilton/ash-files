    "abstract_text": "Introduction The additional benefit of consolidation radiotherapy (RT) following chemotherapy in limited stage DLBCL remains controversial. Previous 5 randomized trials, 4 trials before rituximab era (SWOG 8736, ECOG 1484, GELA 93-1 and 93-4 studies) and 1 trial with R-CHOP combination (Lysa/Goelams 02-03), could not demonstrate a remarkable benefit of RT. The purpose of this study is to explore the benefit of combined modality treatment including the combination of RT and rituximab (R)-based chemotherapy in limited stage DLBCL. Methods From the 4,371 patients in a multi-institutional registry of newly diagnosed lymphoma in Thailand between 2007-2014, there were a total of 2,399 patients with DLBCL. We included patients with limited stage DLBCL receiving CHOP/CHOP-liked chemotherapy +/- R and +/- RT. The baseline patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were analyzed according to treatment modalities. Results A total of 816 patients with a median age of 56 years (range, 15-91) were included in the study. Male:female was 1:1.1. Majority of patients had primary extranodal diseases (58%), stage II (68%), good performance status (89%), normal LDH (55%) and no B-symptoms (59%). The IPI scores were 0 (30.6%), 1(45%), 2 (20%) and 3 (3.9%), respectively. The modalities of treatment were CHOP alone (48.5%), R-CHOP (26.5%), CHOP+RT (17.9%) and R-CHOP+RT (7.1%). Patients in R-CHOP group were older than in other groups ( P =0.001) (Table 1).There was a higher proportion of patients in stage II disease in R-CHOP (74.1%) and R-CHOP+RT (74.1%) groups than in CHOP (66.9%) and CHOP+RT (57.5%) groups ( P =0.007), whereas the patients were relatively equally distributed between the IPI scores. Complete response (CR) rate was higher in R-CHOP+RT group (82.8%) than in R-CHOP (75%), CHOP+RT (70%) and CHOP groups (58%) ( P <0.001). CR was independently associated with consolidation RT (OR 0.65, 95%CI: 0.45-0.97), rituximab-based therapy (OR 0.66; 95%CI: 0.55-0.79) and IPI score (OR 1.90; 95%CI: 1.41-2.57). With a median follow up of 52 months, 4-year progression free survival (PFS) were 76.4%, 69.4%, 61.4% and 49.9% in R-CHOP+RT, R-CHOP, CHOP+RT and CHOP alone, respectively, ( P <0.001) (Figure. 1). The corresponding figures of 4-year OS for each group were 78.6%, 76.3%, 64.3% and 59.6%, respectively ( P <0.001) (Figure. 2). Multivariate analysis showed that factors associated with survivals were consolidation RT (HR for PFS 0.63, 95%CI: 0.48-0.82; HR for OS 0.70, 95%CI: 0.53-0.94), rituximab-based therapy (HR for PFS 0.72, 95%CI: 0.64-0.83; HR for OS 0.69, 95%CI: 0.60-0.81) and IPI scores (HR for PFS 1.87, 95%CI: 1.54-2.26; HR for OS 1.96, 95%CI: 1.60-2.41) Conclusion In limited stage DLBCL, consolidation RT plus R-CHOP yielded a superior outcome compared to R-CHOP, CHOP + RT and CHOP alone. Thus, RT continues to have an important role and should not be omitted in management of limited stage DLBCL in rituximab era. Table 1.
