    "abstract_text": "CB use is limited by the absence of available donor effector cells (NK, and NKT cells) for SCT (Cairo, et al Transfusion , 2005). The immaturity of CB, characterized by reduced expression and production of IL-15, IL-12 and IL-18 in activated CB (Qian et al, Blood, 1997; Lee at al, Blood , 1996; Satwani et al. Br J Hem, 2005), may contribute to reduced CB cellular immunity and delayed immune reconstitution after UCBT. In innate immunity, NK cells (CD3 \u2212 /56 + ) are regulated by various NK receptor (NKR) expression. NK(CD56 dim ) cells are cytotoxic, constitute 90% of the NK population while 10% (CD56 bright ) are cytokine producing (Shereck/Cairo , Ped Bld Can , 2007). NKT cells, (CD3 + /CD56 + ), may play a role in allograft and tumor cytotoxicity. We demonstrated the ability to EvE (48 hrs; with anti-CD3 (50ng/ml), IL-2 (5 ng/ml), IL-7 (10 ng/ml) and IL-12 (10 ng/ml) [ABCY]) c ryopreserved, t hawed, re c ryopreserved, re t hawed, (CTCTE) CB with increases in NK bright/dim subsets expressing NKRs and enhanced NK in-vitro and in-vivo cytotoxicity (Ayello et al. BBMT, 2006 ). We compared day 2 vs 7 EvE CTCTE CB expansion and activation (LAMP-1) of NK and NKT cells expressing NKRs, IL-15, IL-18 and IFN-g protein levels and mechanisms of cytotoxicity. Rethawed nonadherent CB cells were EvE with ABCY. NKRs ( CD3, CD16, CD56, CD94, NKG2A, NKG2D, NKp46, KIR2DS4, KIR2DL2), intracellular perforin and LAMP-1 expression were determined by flow cytometry. IL-18, IL-15 and IFN-g protein measured by ELISA. Non-adherent total cell number were significantly increased at day 7vs2 (6.28\u00b1214.7\u00d710 7 vs 5.87\u00b156.9\u00d710 6, p<0.001, respectively) with no change in the NK dim (CD3 \u2212 /16 + /56 +dim ) subset (40.4\u00b12.1 vs 30.3\u00b18.0%, p=NS, respectively); yet, NKT subset was significantly increased (71.85\u00b16.03 vs 2.97\u00b10.29%, p<0.001). NK bright cells were significantly decreased at day 7 vs 2 (3.3.\u00b11.1 vs 13.4\u00b11.4%, p<0.001) and no change in NK dim KIR inhibiting receptors subset. Further, NK activating receptor (KIR2DS4) in both NK and NKT subsets was increased at day 7 vs 2 (24.8\u00b10.08 vs 3.1\u00b10.43%, p<0.001; 18.9\u00b10.6 vs 1.1\u00b10.06%, p<0.001, respectively). Similarly, both NK dim and NKT NKp46 were increased at day 7 vs 2 (11.4\u00b10.4 vs 2.1\u00b10.2%, p<0.001; 35.9\u00b10.6 vs 7.5\u00b11.1%, p<0.001, respectively). Activating NCR (CD94/NKG2D) expansion was significantly increased at day 7 vs 2 (41.4\u00b10.4 vs 23.7\u00b12%, p<0.001) and NCR inhibitory receptor (CD94/NKG2A) subset was decreased (7.83\u00b11.34 vs 22.7\u00b10.98%, p<0.001). Perforin expression was decreased at day 7 vs 2 (55.7\u00b11.8 vs 84.3\u00b11.3%, p<0.001) yet LAMP-1 expression was increased (65.3\u00b12.2 vs 12.95 \u00b11.5%, p<0.001). IL-18 and IFN-g protein production was increased at day 7 vs 2 (730\u00b14.7 vs 183\u00b18.8 pg/ml, p<0.001; 37.3\u00b17.6 vs 21.6\u00b11.4 pg/ml, p<0.05) as well as increased NK cytotoxicity (K562:71.5\u00b10.8 vs 54\u00b13.9%, p<0.001; Kasumi-1(AML):56.7\u00b10.5 vs 38\u00b11.2%, p<0.001). In summary, CB MNC may be thawed at time of UCBT, recryopreserved, rethawed at a later date, EvE and activated for up to 7 days to yield increased NK and NKT subsets with increased KAR expression (KIR2DS4, CD94/NKG2D, Nkp46), NK activation (LAMP-1), production of IL-18 and IFN-g and cytotoxicity without an increase in NK inhibitory receptor expression. These data suggest that cryopreserved CB cells may be EvE for potential use as ACI for DLI after UCBT."
