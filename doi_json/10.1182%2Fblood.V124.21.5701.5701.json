    "abstract_text": "Background: B-cell\u2013activating factor (BAFF) is a member of TNF family that critical for maintenance of B-cell development and homeostasis. BAFF also modulates the proliferation, survival and drug resistance of multiple meyloma (MM) cells. BAFF can be secreted by neutrophils, monocytes,dentritic cells and macrophages. Our previous study showed that, macrophages protect MM cells from drug-induced apoptosis by a cell-to-cell interaction between MM cells and macrophages. We supposed that the interaction of BAFF and BAFF receptors plays a role in macrophages induced MM resistance. Methods: First, we detected the expression levels of BAFF and its three receptors in MM cells were detected by semiquantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and flow-cytometry. The concentration of BAFF in the culture supernatants of MM cell lines was detected by ELISA. Second, we collect peripheral blood monocytes form healthy donors. Monocytes were induced into macrophages by culturing with M-CSF for 7 days.BAFF expression level in macrophages was detected by qPCR, flow-cytometry and ELISA. Then MM cells were sole-cultured or coculture with macrophages for the indicated time (usually 24 h), after that bortezomib was added to the culture system. Cell viability and apoptosis of MM cells were verified by MTT and flow cytometry.At last,the recombinant human BAFF were added to MM cells, MTT and flow cytometry were used for detection of cell viability and apoptosis of MM cells. Results: Two receptors of BAFF, transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI) and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), are highly expressed in various MM cell lines evidenced by real-time PCR and flow cytometry. The expression of BAFF in PBMC-induced macrophages are heterogeneous. We verify macrophage-mediated MM drug resistance by directly coculturing MM cells (ARP-1, 8226 and OPM2) with PBMC-derived macrophages from healthy donors. Functional studies show that recombinant human BAFF rescues RPMI8226 myeloma cells from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. Conclusions: Our data showed that macrophage might induce drug resistance of MM cells by the interaction of BAFF and BAFF receptors. Further study will focused on the mechanism of interaction between BAFF and BAFF receptors. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
