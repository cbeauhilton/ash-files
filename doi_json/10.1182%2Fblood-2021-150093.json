    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) is the only curative treatment option for various malignant hematological diseases. The therapeutic effect of alloHSCT is a long-lasting graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect of the transferred graft. T cells are important mediators of GvL and the longitudinal tracking of T-cell clones from donor to recipient is of particular interest in the setting of alloHSCT as this might provide further insight into mechanisms leading to survival and expansion of particular clones. In a broader sense, we used the unique setting of alloHSCT to study survival and expansion of mature T-cell clones after transfer into an immune cell depleted and allogeneic patient. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to integrate immune subset delineation, clone identification and transcriptome information of about 35500 single T cells in peripheral blood of 14 paired donor-recipient samples in four alloHSCT pairs. Donor samples were collected before and after treatment with Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (GCSF), and recipient samples were collected on days +90 and +180 post-transplant. Looking at common diversity scores of pooled donor versus pooled recipient time points we observe an expected decrease of TCR diversity after transplantation (median inv. Simpson's 379 in donor vs. 20 in recipient samples, p=0.011, Figure 1A). On single cell level, we observe a substantial decrease of unique T-cell clones after transplantation compared to donor samples, which in return means that certain TCR clones markedly expand, contributing to a skewing of the TCR repertoire in the post-transplant course. The majority of these cells represent CD8 effector memory T cells. Our main interest was a better understanding of traceable and persisting T-cell clones. In a first step, we looked at the overall clonal overlap between time points of the different donor-recipient pairs, using only combined TCR alpha and beta chain information to define specific T-cell clones. We find the highest overlaps of T-cell clones between time points within individuals (e.g., Morisita score 0.91 between preGCSF and postGCSF of donor 16 and Morisita score 0.65 between days +90 and +180 of recipient 16, Figure 1B). Additionally, we demonstrate an inter-individual overlap between donors and their respective recipients in all pairs on single cell level (Figure 1C). Next, we compared the differential gene expression of traceable and non-traceable T cell clones and found that the traceable T cell clones exhibit a distinct transcriptional program, characterized by upregulation of genes related to T cell proliferation and chemotaxis as well as antigen presentation, while housekeeping functions such as translation are downregulated. In order to examine the dynamic changes of the T-cell transcriptome, we looked at the differential gene expression at the consecutive time points of pooled traceable clones in all pairs. This shows an induction of an activation pattern during the donor-recipient transfer and post-transplant phase involving genes related to the cell cycle and graft-versus-host disease (Figure 1D). Phenotype analysis via antibody-derived tags accordingly revealed an upregulation of activation markers in the recipients. To our knowledge, this is the first time that longitudinal inter-individual (donor-to-recipient) overlap of single-cell TCR alpha/beta clones is demonstrated in the setting of alloHSCT revealing time point-dependent and distinct functional patterns in traceable donor T cell clones.
