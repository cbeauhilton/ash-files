    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3023 Poster Board II-999 NK Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands play critical roles in maintaining natural killer (NK) cell tolerance, while providing surveillance against pathogens and malignant transformation. Natural killer (NK) cells have been explored as tools for adoptive anti-tumor or leukemia immunotherapy and current models hold that a mismatch or absence of KIR ligands on target cells is essential for efficient NK cell mediated cytolysis. However, new approaches are now available to activate NK cells and the role for KIR mediated signaling in regulating cytotoxicity of activated NK cells has not been well studied. In this study, aAPCs comprising IL15Ra + K562 cells engineered to express 4-1BBL activated and expanded peripheral NK cells in the presence of exogenous IL15 up to 1000-fold in 3 weeks. Compared to resting NK cells, 4-1BBL/IL15-activated NK cells upregulated TRAIL and NKp30, 44, 46 expression, and showed significantly enhanced cytotoxicity against a multitude of tumor targets including K562, Daudi, Ewing's tumors, osteosarcoma, as well as autologous tumors (50%-90% killing vs. 0%-8% with non-activated NK cells). Meanwhile we could detect little to no influence of KIR signaling in regulating cytotoxicity by aAPC activated NK cells, since sorted CD158a + and CD158b + activated NK cells showed similar killing of tumor cells expressing HLA group C1 (CD158b ligand) and/or C2 (CD158a ligand) antigens. In contrast, killer activating receptors (KARs) were indispensable for the cytolysis of solid pediatric tumors by aAPC-activated NK cells, since the killing was significantly inhibited by fusion proteins binding to the ligands of NKG2D, NK p30, p44, p46, p80 (KARs). About 20-40% inhibition of the killing was accomplished when all four activating receptors were blocked, though other activating receptors have not been well defined. Although acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blasts were refractory to fresh NK cytotoxicity, 4-1BBL/IL15 activated NK cells demonstrated higher lytic activities (20%-50%) against ALL blasts from either patients or cell lines. ALL blast lysis could be completely or partially inhibited by KAR-blocking fusion proteins, indicating that expression levels of KAR ligands vary among ALL cases and other solid tumors. We conclude that KIR ligand mismatch or absence is not essential for effective NK cytotoxicities on either solid tumors or ALL when fully activated NK cells are utilized. This suggests that adoptive therapy with autologous aAPC-activated NK cells may prove effective in some clinical settings, such as ALL, AML, or certain solid tumors. Further studies to assess the impact of KAR ligand expression on aAPC-activated NK killing of ALL blasts are in progress.
