    "abstract_text": "The Dutch Hemato-Oncology Study Group (HOVON) evaluated in a phase II trial the efficacy of the addition of rituximab, high dose Ara-C and autologous stem cell transplantation after BEAM conditioning to conventional CHOP in 88 previously untreated patients with mantle cell lymphoma, with respect to remission rate, failure free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS). From 2002 to 2005, 86 eligible patients were included and evaluated. The male : female ratio was: 4 and the median age 55 years (32\u201366). Median follow-up of all patients still alive was 25.5 months. Patients were treated with R-CHOP 21 x 3 (rituximab 375 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 , doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 , vincristine 1.4 mg/m 2 day 1 and prednisone 100 mg days 1 \u2013 5). Stem cells were harvested after high dose Ara-C x 1 (2g/m 2 BID days 1 \u2013 4), followed by rituximab on day 11 for in vivo purging and G- CSF. After haematological recovery BEAM conditioning (carmustine 300mg/m 2 day 1, Ara-C 200mg/m 2 and etoposide 200 mg/m 2 days 2 \u2013 5 and melphalan 2 x 100 mg/m 2 day 6) was given with autologous stem cell support day 8). After 3 x R-CHOP 17 patients did not reach PR and went off study, according to the protocol, and 5 patients were excluded for other reasons. Sixty four patients received HD Ara-C and 63 patients proceeded to BEAM. Haematological toxicity was as follows: the median time of recovery of leukocytes (> 1,0 x 10 9 /l) from start of high dose Ara-C was 17 days (range: 0 \u2013 59 days), from start of BEAM 26 days (range: 17 \u2013 55). For platelets the median time to recovery (> 50 x 10 9 /l) from start of high dose Ara-C was 23 days (range: 0 \u2013 44 days) and from start of BEAM 25 days (range: 16 \u2013 364). Non-hematological toxicity grade 3\u20134 was seen during CHOP in 13%, after HD Ara-C in 20%, mainly gastro-intestinal, and after BEAM in 51%, mainly gastro-intestinal and liver, of the patients. Grade 3\u20134 infections were seen during CHOP in 17%, after HD Ara-C in 30% and after BEAM in 59% of the patients. Responses to treatment are summarised in Table 1. At two years FFS was 67%, OS was 81%. An analysis restricted to the 63 patients who completed the protocol treatment showed FFS 90% and OS 98% at two years. We conclude that intensification of first line treatment with rituximab, HD Ara-C and BEAM is beneficial with respect to FFS and OS in younger MCL patients and that this regimen is well tolerated.
