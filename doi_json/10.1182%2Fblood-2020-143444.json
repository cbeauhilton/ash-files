    "abstract_text": "Background Thrombosis is one of the most common complications described in patients with sickle cell disease. However, little is known about the prevalence, variety and severity of thrombus particularly in sickle cell patients hospitalized with vaso-occlusive crisis. Methods We made a retrospective chart review of patients (age 21 years or older) admitted with sickle cell disease at Hurley Medical Center (Flint, Michigan) and was diagnosed with a thrombotic event between April 2012 and April 2020. To obtain a logistic model, we identified all patients with the the final discharge diagnosis of thrombosis (ICD-9 or ICD-10 code indicating any thrombosis, such as DVT, arterial thrombosis, catheter-related thrombus, pulmonary embolism, and stroke), combined with the diagnosis of sickle cell disease. Findings 37/137 (27%) sickle cell patients were found to have had at least one thrombotic event during their hospitalization. As predicted, patients with sickle cell disease appeared to have very high frequency of thrombotic complications, though we lack a control group to compare with. Genotypes of sickle cell disease was also measured in this study. Patients with the Hb-SS disease had a much higher rate of this complication(25/68=37%) compared with those with Hb SC disease patients (12/49=24%). There were no thrombotic events reported in patients with Hb S/beta thalassemia+, or 0 patients or in patients with Hb SS with HPFH. Interpretation The risk of a thromboembolic event in patients with SCD is high, Sickle cell anemia is a procoagulant condition, which is a risk factor for thrombosis. More research is required to determine if preventive modalities could reduce thrombotic risk. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
