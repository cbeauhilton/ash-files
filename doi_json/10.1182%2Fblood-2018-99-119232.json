    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Systemic Mastocytosis (SM) is a rare disease characterized by the clonal proliferation and accumulation of mast cells in the bone marrow, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, and organs such as the skin, liver, spleen, and brain. Common symptoms include pruritus, flushing, headache, cognitive impairment, fatigue, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hypotension and skin lesions, as well as an increased risk for osteoporosis and anaphylaxis. SM is currently managed with antihistamines, cromolyn sodium, and leukotriene blocking agents, which lack specificity and efficacy. In addition, glucocorticoids can provide temporary relief in some cases; however long-term treatment with steroids is not appropriate due to their many side effects. Siglec-8 is an inhibitory receptor selectively expressed on human mast cells and eosinophils, and therefore represents a novel target for the treatment of SM. Antibodies to Siglec-8 have been shown to inhibit mast cell activity and induce apoptosis of eosinophils. AK002 is a novel, humanized, non-fucosylated IgG1 monoclonal antibody to Siglec-8. This study evaluates the expression of Siglec-8 and ex vivo activity of AK002 on mast cells and eosinophils in bone marrow biopsies from patients with SM. METHODS: Bone marrow aspirates were obtained from patients clinically diagnosed with SM and processed to remove red blood cells. Multi-color flow cytometry was used to quantify eosinophils and mast cells and to evaluate the activation state of mast cells. The ex vivo activity of AK002 against eosinophils and mast cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. The inhibitory activity of AK002 agaist mast cells was also examined by quantifying cytokine levels in cultured bone marrow aspirate supernatants. RESULTS: All mast cells and eosinophils in bone marrow aspirates from SM patients displayed high Siglec-8 receptor expression (Figure 1). These mast cells also expressed the SM specific markers, CD25 (Figure 1) and CD30 and increased levels of cell surface degranulation markers. The expression of CD25 on mast cells significantly decreased following overnight treatment with AK002. AK002 also significantly reduced the level of mast cell-associated cytokines produced in cultured bone marrow supernatants, including IL-6, IL-8, and TNF\u03b1 (Figure 2A). These changes in mast cell activity after AK002 treatment were not due to a reduction in mast cell numbers. In contrast, overnight incubation of AK002 significantly reduced the number of bone marrow eosinophils compared to an isotype control (Figure 2B). CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow aspirates from patients with SM had activated mast cells and eosinophils that displayed robust expression of Siglec-8. AK002 demonstrated SM mast cell inhibition in ex vivo bone marrow aspirates. AK002 also had depleting effects on eosinophils, which may be valuable to SM patients with associated eosinophilia. These encouraging results could represent a novel approach for the treatment of SM. View large Download slide View large Download slide  Disclosures Youngblood: Allakos, Inc.: Employment.
