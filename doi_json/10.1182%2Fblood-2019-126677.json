    "abstract_text": "[Background] Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) on hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) may have some roles in the negative regulation of the HSPC commitment induced by inflammatory cytokines given the fact that progenies of GPI(-) HSPC are often detected in patients with immune-mediated bone marrow (BM) failure. CD109, one of the GPI-APs expressed by keratinocytes and HSPCs in humans, serves as a TGF-\u03b2 co-receptor and is reported to inhibit TGF-\u03b2 signaling in keratinocytes; however, the role of CD109 on HSPCs remains unknown. We previously demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 induced erythroid differentiation of TF-1 cells, a myeloid leukemia cell line that expresses CD109, in a dose-dependent manner and that knockout of the CD109 gene resulted in erythroid differentiation of TF-1 cells cultured in fetal bovine serum-containing medium, suggesting an inhibitory role of CD109 in the erythroid differentiation of HSPCs induced by low levels of TGF-\u03b2 (Blood, 2018. 132 (Suppl.1) :3874). However, as most CD109 KO TF-1 cells changed into erythroid cells, they were unsuitable for investigating the role of CD109 in the erythroid differentiation induced by TGF-\u03b2. To overcome this issue, we prepared TF-1 cells and cord blood (CB) HSPCs in which the CD109 expression was transiently downregulated, and attempted to further clarify the role of CD109. [Methods] TF-1 cells and CD34 + cells isolated from CB mononuclear cells were treated with siRNA that was complementary to CD109 mRNA. CD109 knockdown cells were cultured for 4 days in serum-free medium supplemented with stem cell factor, thrombopoietin, and erythropoietin with or without TGF-\u03b2. In separate experiments, TF-1 cells were treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPL-C) treatment for 1 hour and were incubated in the presence or absence of TGF-\u03b2. CD109 KO TF-1 cells were incubated in serum-free medium (StemPro-34 SFM) for 14 days and their phenotype was determined using flow cytometry (FCM). The erythroid differentiation of the cells was assessed by testing the expression of glycophorin A (GPA) and iron staining. [Results] The down-regulation of CD109 in TF-1 cells by the siRNA treatment increased GPA expression in response to 12 ng/ml of TGF-\u03b2 from 1.77% to 35.6%. The transient depletion of GPI-APs by PIPL-C also augmented the GPA expression induced by TGF-\u03b2 from 1.27% to 6.77%. In both BM of healthy individuals and CB, CD109 was more abundantly expressed in Lin - CD34 + CD38 - CD90 + CD45RA - hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) than in Lin - CD34 + CD38 - CD90 - CD45RA - multipotent progenitors (MPPs) and Lin - CD34 + CD38 + HSPCs ( Fig. 1 ). The treatment of CB cells with siRNA reduced the CD109 expression in Lin - CD34 + CD38 + cells from 55.9% to 23.1%. TGF-\u03b2 induced the expression of GPA in Lin - CD34 + CD38 + CD123 - CD45RA - megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor cells (MEPs) of CD109 knockdown cells to a greater degree than the control counterpart ( Fig. 2 ). During 14-day serum-free culture, GPA-positive CD109 KO TF-1 cells died, and similarly to WT TF-1 cells, most surviving CD109 KO TF-1 cells were GPA-negative. TGF-\u03b2 treatment induced erythroid differentiation in CD109 KO TF-1 cells to a greater degree than in WT TF-1 cells. [Conclusions] CD109 plays a key role in the inhibition of TF-1 erythroid differentiation in response to TGF-\u03b2. CD109 may suppress TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and the lack of CD109 may make PIGA -mutated HSPCs more sensitive to TGF-\u03b2, thus leading to the preferential commitment of the mutant erythroid progenitor cells to mature red blood cells in immune-mediated BM failure.
