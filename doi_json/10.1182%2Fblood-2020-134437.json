    "abstract_text": "Background Genomic abnormalities such as del(17p)/ TP53 mutation, del(11q), and unmutated IGHV are risk factors that predict inferior outcomes with chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) in patients (pts) with CLL/SLL (Byrd J Clin Oncol 2006). Mutations in BIRC3 , NOTCH1 , SF3B1 , and XPO1 have also been associated with poor outcomes with CIT in pts with CLL (Foa Haematologica 2013; Jain Am J Hematol 2016). Ibrutinib (ibr) is the only once-daily Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor with significant progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) benefit shown in multiple randomized phase 3 studies versus established therapies in pts with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL. Superior outcomes were demonstrated with ibr-based therapy versus comparators in the overall population, and in pts with high-risk disease features, such as TP53 aberrations, del(11q), and/or unmutated IGHV in the RESONATE-2 study of first-line single-agent ibr (Burger Leukemia 2020) and in the iLLUMINATE study of first-line ibr-obinutuzumab (Moreno Lancet Oncol 2019). In pts with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL who were treated with ibr, mutations in BIRC3 , NOTCH1 , SF3B1 , or XPO1 had no significant impact on the PFS benefit conferred by ibr (Byrd Blood 2019). To better understand outcomes in pts with previously untreated CLL with various high-risk genomic features, including integrated FISH cytogenetics and single gene mutations, we performed a pooled analysis of two phase 3 studies of ibr-based therapy in the first-line treatment of CLL/SLL (RESONATE-2 and iLLUMINATE). Methods In RESONATE-2 (NCT01722487), pts aged \u226565 years without del(17p) were randomized to single-agent ibr or chlorambucil (clb). In iLLUMINATE (NCT02264574), pts aged \u226565 years, or <65 years with coexisting conditions or del(17p)/ TP53 mutation, were randomized to ibr-obinutuzumab or clb-obinutuzumab. A central lab performed FISH or targeted next generation sequencing, respectively, to examine for del(17p) and del(11q), or mutations in IGHV , TP53, BIRC3 , SF3B1 , NOTCH1 , or XPO1 . Clinical outcomes (PFS and overall response rate [ORR]) were determined for subsets defined by FISH cytogenetics or single gene mutations alone or in combination (Dohner N Engl J Med 2000; Rossi Blood 2013). PFS (reported as 42-mo Kaplan-Meier estimates and hazard ratios [HRs]), ORR (with rate ratios), and safety were compared between (1) ibr- versus clb-based therapies and (2) ibr-treated pts with vs without high-risk genomic CLL features. Results The pooled analysis included 498 pts treated with first-line ibr-based or clb-based therapy (n=249 each) with median follow-up of 49.1 mos (range, 0.1-78.7). Ibr-based therapy significantly improved ORR and PFS vs comparator (clb-based) therapy. At 42 mo, PFS rates were significantly higher across high-risk genomic subgroups in ibr-treated pts (63-82%) compared with clb-treated pts (6-34%), and consistent PFS benefit with ibr was observed across all high-risk genomic subgroups ( Figure ). When comparing ibr-treated pts with specified high-risk genomic features vs those without, PFS and ORR were comparable in the different subgroups, including pts with unmutated vs mutated IGHV (PFS HR, 1.79, 95% CI 0.99-3.24) or mutated vs not mutated NOTCH1 (PFS HR, 1.05, 95% CI 0.65-1.69) ( Table ). Improved outcome was also noted for pts with del(17p)/ TP53 mutated/ BIRC3 mutated, the highest risk category per Rossi 2013 (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.54-2.04). At a median duration of ibr treatment of 35.7-43.8 mo across these high-risk subgroups, there were no meaningful differences in the rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) of any grade or grade \u22653 AEs compared to those of the overall population. Conclusions This integrated analysis of pts undergoing first-line ibr-based treatment, with up to 79 mo follow up, demonstrated similar PFS and ORR for ibr-treated pts with or without high-risk genomic features, and confirmed significant PFS and ORR benefits with ibr-based therapy versus clb (\u00b1 obinutuzumab). This analysis across two phase 3 studies demonstrated the efficacy of first-line ibr-based treatment irrespective of cytogenetic and mutational risk features, including those with unmutated IGHV , NOTCH1 mutation, and those with the highest risk classification of del(17p)/ TP53 mutation/ BIRC3 mutation.
