    "abstract_text": "Background: Platelet binding to leukocytes has been shown to induce leukocyte activation in vitro. It is unknown to what extent platelet binding to leukocytes regulates leukocyte activation in vivo . We examined the correlation between platelet binding to leukocytes (platelet-leukocytes conjugates) and leukocyte activation in various clinical conditions. Methods: We studied a total of 321 venous blood samples from 291 subjects with acute venous thromboembolism (n=25), atrial fibrillation (n=48), metabolic syndrome (n=37), congestive heart failure (n=44), antiphospholipid syndrome (n=70), early sepsis (n=35), late sepsis (n=30) and normal controls. Using flow cytometry, we measured leukocyte expression of activation marker CD11b. Platelet-leukocyte conjugate measurement was based on co-expression of CD41 and CD45. Results: Levels of platelet-leukocyte conjugates strongly correlated with CD11b expression. This finding was present in congestive heart failure (r=0.47; p=0.001), atrial fibrillation (r=0.32; p=0.02), metabolic syndrome (r=0.51; p=0.001), venous thromboembolism (r=0.74; p<0.0001), early sepsis (r=0.70; p<0.0001), late sepsis (r=0.66, p=0.0002), and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (r=0.53; p<0.0001). In normal controls, the relationship between platelet-leukocyte conjugates and CD11b expression was best described by a 2 nd -degree polynomial model, which included the quadratic term platelet-leukocyte conjugates squared, suggesting a threshold effect. The quadratic term added significant prediction of CD11b expression, demonstrating a highly significant exponential increase in CD11b expression after a threshold level of platelet-leukocyte conjugates is reached (model R 2 =0.57; r 2 increase from quadratic term=29%; p=0.0001), as shown in Figure 1. This threshold was not seen in any disease state examined (all p for quadratic terms > 0.05). For example, the relation between platelet-leukocyte conjugates and CD11b expression in venous thromboembolism is shown in Figure 2, and is best described by a straight line. The addition of quadratic term did not add any prediction of CD11b expression, as shown. Conclusions: Our findings strongly suggest that platelet binding to leukocytes is a key determinant of leukocyte activation in vivo . The degree of platelet binding to leukocytes strongly correlates with leukocyte activation after a threshold is reached in normal adults. This threshold is lost in pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory disease states, in which a linear increase in leukocyte activation is seen with increasing platelet binding to leukocytes. Figure 1.
