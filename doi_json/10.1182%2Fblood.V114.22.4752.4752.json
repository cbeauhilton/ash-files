    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4752 BACKGROUND CHOP \u00b1 Rituximab ( R) is the standard regimen for elderly patients (pts) with aggressive lymphoma but many of them are not suitable for it due to severe associated comorbidities. The aim was to evaluate retrospectively the efficacy and safety of a modified-CHOP (with reduced dose non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (NPLD) \u00b1 R in elderly pts with clinically aggressive lymphoma not tributary to standard anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective analysis of 30 pts (16M/14W). Median age 76 years (60-88). Stage III-IV: 19 pts (58%). IPI 3-5: 16 pts (49%). Median baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): 63% (33-80). Median NT-proBNP determination: 1431 ng/L (60-9120), 14 patients had NT-proBNP>900. All patients had one or more severe comorbidities. Schedule: NPLD 30mg/m 2 (d1), cyclophosphamide 750mg/m 2 (d1), vincristine 1.4mg/m 2 (d1), prednisone 100mg/d (d1-5) \u00b1 R 375mg/m 2 (d1) + Pegfilgrastim (d2) every 21 days. RESULTS Median follow-up time was 18 months. Median number of cycles was 4 (range 1-6). Complete response (CR/uCR): 24 pts (73%), Partial response: 4 pts (12%). Two pts progressed during chemotherapy and 10 pts relapsed during follow-up (5 of them dying with active disease). Overall Survival (OS) at 12 and 24 months was 76% (95%CI 61-91) and 70% (95%CI 49-91), respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 and 24 months was 65% (95%CI 49-81) and 55% (95%CI 32-78), respectively. A total of 154 cycles were administered. 52% of patients showed grade III-IV neutropenia and 33% of them required hospital admission for febrile neutropenia. LVEF neither NT-proBNP value was significantly different before and after treatment with one patient showing an important improvement in his LVEF. Multivariate analysis recognized NT-proBNP determination >900ng/L as the most negative important factor in OS and PFD. CONCLUSION Reduced dose of non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in this modified CHOP regimen is an effective treatment for patients with aggressive lymphoma and contraindications to receive standard chemotherapy. Despite using pegfilgrastim in this regimen, more than one third of patients had to be admitted by febrile neutropenia at any time. NT-proBNP value at baseline > 900 ng/ml was identified as a strong predictor variable for OS and PFS. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
