    "abstract_text": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpes virus that infects over 90% of the world's population and is linked with cancer development. In immune-competent individuals, EBV-infection is controlled by a highly efficient virus-specific T cell response. Following primary infection, the virus achieves lifelong persistence within the human host. Risk of EBV-driven cancers increases with immune suppression (IS). Solid organ transplant recipients receive IS medications to prevent graft rejection and are at highest risk of developing EBV-associated lymphomas known as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). PTLD represents a serious complication of organ transplantation, associated with poor prognosis. Currently, no standard approach for prevention or treatment exists. Reducing the level of IS medication may control PTLD but often leads to graft-rejection. In order to promote long-term protection from EBV-driven cancers, we have developed a vaccine to bolster EBV-specific immunity by targeting the EBV immediate early protein, BZLF1. BZLF1 initiates the activation of lytic stage in EBV-infected cells and promotes B-cell transformation. Work by our group has shown BZLF1-specific T cell expansion following reduction in IS medications correlates with PTLD tumor regression and improved patient survival. Here we specifically delivered the protein (BZLF1) to dendritic cells (DCs) through its endocytic receptor DEC205. DCs were generated from HLA-B8+ donor monocytes incubated with interleukin-4 (IL4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Mature DCs were then loaded with DEC205-BZLF1 fusion protein or control protein (DEC205-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (DEC205-HCG)). Antigen-loaded DCs were co-cultured with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the presence of IL-2 for 10 days. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using HLA-tetramers to detect and quantify antigen-specific cytotoxic T leukocyte (CTL) response. To test the EBV vaccine in-vivo, we utilized a human-murine chimeric model of EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-LPD). Severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice were engrafted with PBMCs from EBV+ donors (Hu-PBL-SCID model). The spontaneous EBV-LPD that develops in this model is comprised of human CD20+, EBV+ lymphoblasts that closely resembles PTLD. Mice were immunized with DCs loaded with DEC205-BZLF1 or DEC205-HCG at the time of PBMC transplant and received booster doses at day 14 and 28. Splenocyte from vaccinated mice were stimulated with autologous tumor (lymphoblastoid cells line, (LCL)) pulsed with BZLF1 pepmix, BZLF1 pepmix alone, and anti-CD3. Secretion of IFNg by stimulated splenocytes was detected using Human IFNg Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Spot (ELISpot). In vitro co-cultures treated with DEC205-BZLF1-loaded DCs showed increased expansion of EBV-specific CTLs (p-value: 0.0002) capable of abundant IFNg production and potent cytotoxicity against autologous tumor. This vaccine significantly improved survival in vaccinated mice (p-value: 0.035). Splenocytes from mice in the DEC205-BZLF1 vaccination group revealed higher responsiveness to autologous LCLs and BZLF1 pepmix compared to controls as determined by ELISpot. Human cells recovered from mouse spleen will be analyzed by mass cytometry using a multi-parametric antibody panel to evaluate central/effector memory status, CD4 + Th, CD8 + CTL, NK, and monocyte subsets. These results further support pre-clinical and clinical development of vaccine approaches utilizing the BZLF1 protein as an immunogen to harness adaptive cellular responses to prevent EBV-associated LPD in vulnerable patient populations.
