    "abstract_text": "Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a disorder characterized by increased intestinal iron absorption, which leads to a progressive accumulation of iron in the body. This iron overload has been associated with mutations in HFE gene (C282Y, H63D and S65C) and other genes. The objectives of this study were to assess the frequencies of functional mutations in HFE and TFR2 genes and to investigate their relationship with the iron status in a sample of blood donors. Blood donors (n=542) were recruited at the Hemocenter of the Santa Casa Hospital, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The genotypes for HFE (C282Y, H63D and S65C) TFR2 (Y250X and Q690P) gene mutations were evaluated by PCR-RFLP. The concentrations of serum iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) were measured by automation system Advia \u00ae (Bayer Diagnostics) and serum ferritin by Axsym System \u00ae (Abbott Laboratories). The frequencies of HFE 282Y, HFE 63D and HFE 65C alleles were 2.1, 13.6 and 0.6%, respectively. The frequency C282Y allele (2.1%) in Brazilian blood donors is lower than that observed in blood donors from Northern Europe (5.1 to 8.2%, P<0.05). The TFR2 250X and TFR2 690P alleles were not found in these subjects. The iron status was similar between HFE genotypes in women. However, men carrying HFE 282CY genotype had higher serum ferritin and lower TIBC concentrations when compared to the HFE 282CC genotype carriers. HFE 282CY genotype was also associated with higher transferrin saturation in men who donated blood at the first time. Moreover, male donors with HFE 63DD plus 63HD genotypes had higher serum iron and transferrin saturation when compared to those with HFE 63HH genotype. A relationship between HFE CY/HH/SS haplotype and lower TIBC concentrations was also found in men. The HFE 282Y and HFE 65C alleles were rare while the HFE 63D was frequent in blood donors. The mutations in TFR2 gene were not found in this study. The HFE 282Y and HFE 63D alleles were associated with alterations on iron status only in male blood donors."
