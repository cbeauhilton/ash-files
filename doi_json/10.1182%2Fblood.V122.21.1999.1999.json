    "abstract_text": "Our previous studies have shown the ability of human CD34+ cells to stimulate T cell alloproliferative responses in-vitro. Here, we investigated anti-CD34 T cell alloreactivity in-vivo by co-transplanting human CD34+ cells and allogeneic T cells of an incompatible individual into NSG mice. Human CD34+ cells (2x105/animal) were transplanted with allogeneic T cells at different ratios ranging from 1:50 to 1:0.5, or without T cells as a control. No xenogeneic GVHD was detected at 1:1 CD34:T cell ratio. Engraftment of human CD45+ (huCD45+) cells in mice marrow and spleen was analyzed by flow cytometry. Marrow engraftment of huCD45+ cells at 4 or 8 weeks was significantly decreased in mice transplanted with T cells compared to control mice that did not receive T cells. More importantly, transplantation of T cells at CD34:T cell ratios from 1:50 to 1:0.5 resulted in stem cell rejection since >98% huCD45+ cells detected were CD3+. In mice with stem cell rejection, human T cells had a normal CD4:CD8 ratio and CD4+ cells were mostly CD45RA+. The kinetics of human cell engraftment in the bone marrow and spleen was then analyzed in mice transplanted with CD34+ and allogeneic T cells at 1:1 ratio and sacrificed at 1, 2, or 4 weeks. At 2 weeks post transplant, the bone marrow showed CD34-derived myeloid cells, whereas the spleen showed only allo-T cells. At 4 weeks, all myeloid cells had been rejected and only T cells were detected both in the bone marrow and spleen. Based on our previous in-vitro studies showing that T cell alloreactivity against CD34+ cells is mainly due to B7:CD28 costimulatory activation, we injected the mice with CTLA4-Ig (Abatacept, Bristol Myers Squibb, New York, NY) from d-1 to d+28 post transplantation of CD34+ and allogeneic T cells. Treatment of mice with CTLA4-Ig prevented rejection and allowed CD34+ cells to fully engraft the marrow of NSG mice at 4 weeks with an overall 13\u00b1 7% engraftment of huCD45+ marrow cells (n=5) which included: 53\u00b19% CD33+ cells, 22\u00b13% CD14+ monocytes, 7\u00b12% CD1c myeloid dendritic cells, and 4\u00b11% CD34+ cells, while CD19+ B cells were only 3\u00b11% and CD3+ T cells were 0.5\u00b11%. We hypothesize that CTLA4-Ig may induce the apoptotic deletion of alloreactive T cells early in the post transplant period although we could not detect T cells in the spleen as early as 7 or 10 days after transplant. Here we demonstrate that costimulatory blockade with CTLA4-Ig at the time of transplant of human CD34+ cells and incompatible allogeneic T cells can prevent T cell mediated rejection. We also show that the NSG model can be utilized to test immunotherapy strategies aimed at engrafting human stem cells across HLA barriers in-vivo. These results will prompt the design of future clinical trials of CD34+ cell transplantation for patients with severe non-malignant disorders, such as sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, immunodeficiencies or aplastic anemia.
