    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1060 Platelets serve as the primary mediators of hemostasis and thrombosis, circulating as surveyors for gaps in vascular integrity. As platelets encounter exposed extracellular matrix proteins, receptors on the platelet surface trigger intracellular signaling events that result in rapid platelet activation and a complex rearrangement of platelet morphology to form filopodia and lamellipodia. Rac1, a member of the Rho GTPase family, has emerged as a key regulator in platelet actin dynamics. However, the specific downstream events following Rac1 activation that mediate platelet actin cytoskeleton reorganization remain ill-defined. The Rho GTPase, Rac, supports the autocatalytic activation of the p21 activated kinases, or PAKs, to mediate actin reorganization processes in focal adhesion formation and cell migration. Upon activation by GTP-bound Rac, the PAKs phosphorylate a number of substrates to coordinate actin dynamics. Platelets express a number of PAK isoforms, and like Rac, PAK has been shown to be activated as platelets spread on collagen in a Src and PI3K dependent manner. Furthermore, the adaptor protein SLP-76 has been proposed to potentiate PAK activity downstream of Rac activation to mediate platelet lamellipodia formation. However, the specific roles of PAK in platelet function have yet to be characterized. Thus we set out to elucidate the role of PAK in platelet function and to define the connection between Rac activation, PAK, and platelet cytoskeletal reorganization. Our initial experiments with mass spectrometry revealed that following platelet activation, Rac1 associates with a set of PAK effectors, GIT1, GEFH1, LIMK1, and Merlin. We next demonstrated a co-localization of Rac1 and PAK with actin at the leading edge of spread platelets on fibrinogen. In addition, inhibition of PAK signaling by two different pharmacologic inhibitors blocked platelet focal adhesion and lamellopodia formation on both fibrinogen and collagen. Inhibition of PAK signaling abrogated intracellular calcium mobilization in platelets, prevented platelet aggregation to the GPVI-agonist, CRP, and destabilized platelet lamellipodia, resulting in the retraction of lamellipodia in spread platelets. Finally, inhibition of PAK resulted in the disaggregation of platelet aggregates formed under shear flow conditions. Together, these results demonstrate that the PAK signaling system is a key orchestrator of platelet actin dynamics, linking Rho GTPase activation to PAK effector function and platelet lamellopodia formation, thus filling an important gap in the understanding of platelet actin cytoskeletal organization. In addition, these data characterize the integral role of PAK in platelet spreading, aggregation, and aggregate stability. Elucidating the mechanisms that mediate platelet spreading and aggregate formation may highlight important steps in the platelet activation cascade at which to pharmacologically intervene in order to inhibit or treat pathologic thrombi formation.
