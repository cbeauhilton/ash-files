    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1437 Poster Board I-460 Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis and self-renewal are regulated by intrinsic cytokine signaling pathways. One important signaling axis for HSC is the cell surface receptor, Mpl, and its ligand, thrombopoietin (Tpo). Upon Tpo stimulation, Mpl activates Janus Kinase (JAK2), which in turn triggers a cascade of downstream signal transduction pathways that regulate key aspects of cell development. Mice that lack the inhibitory adaptor protein Lnk harbor a vastly expanded HSC pool with enhanced self-renewal. We previously demonstrated that Lnk controls HSC self-renewal predominantly through the Mpl/JAK2 pathway. Lnk binds directly to phosphorylated tyrosine 813 in JAK2 upon Tpo stimulation. Moreover, Lnk-deficient HSCs display potentiated JAK2 activation. Dysregulation of cytokine receptor signaling pathways frequently lead to hematological malignancies. Abnormal activation of JAK2 by a chromosomal translocation between the transcription factor Tel and JAK2 (Tel/JAK2) was shown to cause atypical Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (aCML) in human patients. Moreover, the JAK2 V617F mutation has been observed at high frequency in several myeloproliferative diseases (MPDs). The JAK2V617F retains Lnk binding, suggesting that alterations in Lnk could influence MPD development. Indeed, we found that loss of Lnk accelerates and exacerbates oncogenic JAK2-induced MPD in mouse transplant models. Specifically, Lnk deficiency enhanced cytokine signaling, thereby augmenting the ability of oncogenic JAK2 to expand myeloid progenitors. To test whether the interaction between Lnk and JAK2V617F directly constrains MPD development in mice, we transplanted wild-type bone marrow cells expressing the JAK2V617F/Y813F double mutant that does not interact with Lnk (WT;JAK2VF/YF). WT;JAK2VF/YF engrafted mice exhibited increased myeloid expansion when compared to WT;JAK2VF mice, and conferred accelerated polycythemia vera development in secondary transplants. In summary, we identified Lnk as a physiological negative regulator of JAK2 in stem cells that may constrain leukemic transformation conferred by oncogenic JAK2.
