    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2028 Purpose: Current treatment of advanced stage cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) includes a number of chemotherapy agents which provide good response rates, but with often short duration. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT) has the potential to offer a durable remission due to graft-versus-lymphoma effect. We conducted a retrospective study to report the outcome of HSCT in patients with refractory CTCL. Methods: From Feburary 1997 through May 2012, twenty-one patients (22\u201365 yo) with advanced, refractory CTCL underwent HSCT from HLA-identical sibling (n=13), unrelated donor (n=5), umbilical cord (n=1), syngeneic (n=1) and autolougous (n=1) sources. There were 7 tumor stage MF, 6 Se\u0301zary syndrome, 2 erythrodermic MF, 1 folliculotropic MF, 1 aggressive CD8+ T cell lymphoma (Berti's type), 2 \u03b3-\u03b4 TCL, 1 \u03b1-\u03b2 TCL and 1 CD30-negative large cell peripheral TCL. The intensity of the conditioning regimen was conventional in 10 and reduced in 11. At the time of HSCT, the median disease duration was 5.4 years (1\u201317 y). Most patients were heavily pretreated, having failed a median number of four (1\u20139) lines of therapy. The stage of the disease at the time of HSCT was IIB (n=9), III (n=2), IVA (n=9), and IVB (n=1). Results: For the 21 patients evaluated there was a median follow-up of 62 months (3\u2013186 mo). 11 patients had relapse post-transplant: 5 patients had an early relapse (100 days). Relapsed disease appeared to be of a lower grade clinically than at pre-transplantation and responded to therapies they had previously failed. 1 early relapse died of disease (SS, auto-SCT) and 1 late relapse died of disease (\u03b3-\u03b4 TCL, RIC allo-SCT). Of the nine remaining relapsed patients, 1 has died of a cerebral hemorrhage. (CD30-neg large cell peripheral TCL, alloSCT) and 1 of GVHD (\u03b3-\u03b4 TCL, RIC allo-SCT). Of the 7 remaining relapsed patients, 4 went into CR with reduction of immunosuppression. 14 patients developed acute GVHD (fatal in 3), and 10 developed chronic GVHD. Of the surviving patients (n=15) all are in CR. Overall survival was 71%, with a median OS of 27.1 months (range, 0.5\u2013185.9). Progression free survival (PFS) was 43% with a median PFS of 4.1 months (range, 0.5\u201380). Conclusions: Our results suggest that HSCT can induce durable clinical remissions in patients with refractory CTCL through graft-versus-lymphoma effect.
