    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are widely used anticoagulants for thrombosis treatment. However, these anticoagulants have limitations such as increased bleeding, variable dose response, required frequent monitoring, and, in the case of LMWH, inability to inhibit thrombin. This has led to the development of a covalent complex of antithrombin and heparin (ATH), which has been shown to overcome many of these shortcomings. ATH has faster rates of inhibition of many coagulation factors, is able to inhibit clot-bound thrombin, and is a more effective inhibitor of both venous and arterial thrombosis in animal models. Moreover, in a rabbit thrombosis model, ATH has been shown to decrease clot mass and fibrin accretion, while the contrary was observed for UFH. From these observations, it was suggested that ATH may enhance fibrin breakdown and thus led to investigations into the effects of UFH and ATH on fibrinolysis. In vitro studies have shown that UFH enhances antithrombin inhibition of plasmin. In addition, ATH displays a slightly greater inhibition of plasmin generation and activity. Such studies were conducted in purified systems, in the absence of other plasmin inhibitors naturally present in plasma. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the effects of UFH, LMWH, and ATH on plasmin generation in plasma. Methods: At 37\u00b0C tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and soluble fibrin fragments (fib) were added to normal adult pooled platelet poor plasma supplemented with 0.35, 0.7, 1.4, or 2.1 U anti-Xa/ml UFH, LMWH, or ATH, to initiate plasmin generation (8.93nM tPA and 300\u00b5g/ml fib). At various time points, subsamples were mixed with excess plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) (55.12nM) to stop further plasmin generation. The plasmin concentration at each time point was determined using a plasmin-specific chromogenic substrate and a standard curve produced from purified plasmin. Results: Comparisons of mean area under the curve (AUC) for plasmin generation displayed a significant decrease in plasmin generation in the presence of all three anticoagulants at all doses tested ( p <0.05). Comparing the anticoagulants at similar doses, plasmin generation was significantly decreased in the presence of ATH (15384.66\u00b11930.23nM/min) compared to LMWH (23892.28\u00b13090.54nM/min) at 0.7 U/ml ( p <0.05). At a dose of 1.4 U/ml, there was significantly less plasmin generated, over time, in the presence of UFH (20089.49\u00b13022.1623nM/min) and ATH (19273.86\u00b11805.7323nM/min) when compared to LMWH (24743.18\u00b11265.1023nM/min) ( p <0.05). There was no significant difference in plasmin inhibition between UFH and ATH at any of the doses tested. Conclusion: The present study supports previous findings that UFH and ATH can facilitate antithrombin inhibition of plasmin. It is also observed that LMWH catalyzes the inhibition of plasmin by antithrombin but possibly to a lesser extent. These findings suggest that ATH has a similar inhibitory effect on plasmin generation and activity in plasma compared to UFH, despite its overall superior anticoagulant properties. Therefore, previous in vivo observations displaying decrease in clot mass with administration of ATH was due to its enhanced anticoagulant abilities and not fibrinolysis enhancement. These findings add to our understanding of ATH mechanisms of action and aid in its development for clinical use. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
