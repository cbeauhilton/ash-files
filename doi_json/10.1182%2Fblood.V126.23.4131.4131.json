    "abstract_text": "Serum IgM would be expected to bind chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells through two different mechanisms. The first mechanism is via interactions between the immunoglobulin heavy chain CDR3 of the leukemic B cell receptors (BCRs) and internal epitopes located in the FR2 and FR3 regions of serum IgM molecules, analogous to the recently identified cell-autonomous BCR-BCR interaction. The latter interaction represents a general feature of human CLL BCRs and was recently shown to be positively selected during leukemia development in the E\u03bc-TCL1 transgenic murine model. The second mechanism is by binding of serum IgM to the recently identified Fc receptor for IgM (Fc\u03bcR), which is overexpressed on CLL B cells. In the present study we investigated the consequences of the interaction between serum IgM and CLL cells. Incubation of CLL cells with Alexa488-conjugated human IgM resulted in strong cell surface labeling, confirming that IgM binds to CLL cells. Binding was substantially inhibited by preculture of CLL cells with Fc\u03bc, suggesting that IgM interacts with CLL B cells primarily through the Fc\u03bcR. To investigate whether IgM also binds to the leukemic BCRs, we analyzed activation of downstream BCR signaling pathways and expression of a well-defined set of BCR-target genes (Herishanu Y et al, Blood. 2011;117:563-74) in CLL cells cultured in the presence or absence of purified IgM. After three hours in culture with polyclonal or monoclonal human IgM, 5 of the 7 investigated BCR target genes (OAS3, RGS1, GFI1, CCND2 and KLF4) showed a 2- to 9-fold increase with respect to unstimulated CLL cells, whereas the remaining two genes (EGR1 and EGR2) were not induced. The induced BCR target genes were also upregulated to an equal or even greater extent by Fc\u03bc, suggesting that these effects are primarily or exclusively caused by binding of IgM to the Fc\u03bcR. Analysis of downstream signaling events, such as SYK and ERK phosphorylation, also showed similar induction by IgM and Fc\u03bc. However, intracellular Ca 2+ flux was induced to a substantially greater extent with IgM, suggesting that certain effects are mediated by a direct interaction between serum IgM and the leukemic cell BCRs. Since co-ligation of the Fc\u03bcR was recently shown to enhance the survival of anti-IgM-stimulated murine B lymphocytes (Ouchida R et al, J Immunol. 2015;194:3096-101), we investigated the consequences of IgM binding on CLL cell survival. CLL cells from 18 patients were cultured with or without purified human IgM for 72 hours and then analyzed by Annexin V/PI staining. A modest but significant increase in the percentage of viable CLL cells was observed in the presence of IgM (percentage of viable CLL cells without IgM: 40.5\u00b117.8; with IgM: 43.8\u00b118.4; P =0.016), which was replicated in a smaller series of samples cultured with Fc\u03bc (n=12, percentage of viable CLL cells without Fc\u03bc: 41.1\u00b117.8; with Fc\u03bc: 49.5\u00b115.6; P =0.019). Altogether, these data suggest that binding of serum IgM results in activation of prosurvival pathways in CLL cells and that this effect is most likely mediated by co-triggering the Fc\u03bcR and BCR.
