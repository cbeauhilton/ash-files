    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3228 Although they frequently achieve complete remission (CR), adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) subsequently experience leukemia relapse, which represents an unresolved therapeutic problem. Based on the observation that ALL cells are frequently characterized by the deregulation of the apoptotic machinery, we and others have evaluated pre-clinically the activity of ABT-737 (kindly provided by Abbott Laboratories), a BH3-mimetic Bcl-2/Bcl-XL inhibitor, displaying a potent growth-inhibitory activity in ALL cell lines and primary cells. However ABT-737 binds to the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 with low affinity and Mcl-1 expression may mediate resistance to ABT-737. Since ALL is also characterized by the aberrant activation of the mTOR and related signalling pathways, in the present study we further evaluated the combined Bcl-2/Bcl-XL (by ABT-737) and mTOR (by CCI-779) inhibition focusing, in particular, on the activity of combined molecularly targeted therapies on resistant cells. In MOLT-4 cells, ABT-737 induced dose and time-dependent growth inhibition (IC-50= 198nM) followed, at higher concentrations (250-500nM), by apoptosis induction. In contrast, the CEM-S, CEM-R, JURKAT, DAUDI and RAJI cells proved resistant (IC-50 >5 \u03bcM). When we explored the effects of CCI-779 on the aforementioned cell lines, only minor cytostatic effects were observed (IC-50 0.5\u201328.2\u03bcM). MOLT-4 cells, for example, showed a flat dose-response curve (35-55% growth inhibition) at concentrations ranging between 1 and 5000 nM (IC50=9,87\u03bcM) and apoptosis induction was not seen until 5000 nM. We next investigated the effects of the combined use of ABT-737 and CCI-779 (each at 1000nM) in the ABT-resistant JURKAT cells. A significant (p= 0.04) induction of apoptosis was observed with the combination, as compared with single agents, after 24 h (47.7% \u00b15.9 of cells with sub-G1 DNA content with ABT-737 + CCI-779, compared to 17.4% \u00b11.5 and 4.2% \u00b11.5 with ABT-737 and CCI-779 as single agents, respectively). Similarly, when we exposed CEM-R cells to the drug combination (ABT-737 1000nM and CCI-779 5000nM) for 24 h, a strikingly stronger apoptosis induction (sub-G1 peak= 75.3% \u00b116.8) was observed, compared to single agents (15.8% \u00b17.2 and 4.2% \u00b11.9 with ABT-737 and CCI-779 alone, respectively) (p=0.0003). These effects were confirmed by measuring Annexin V binding. WB analysis showed decreased Mcl-1 levels, following exposure to CCI-779 and further downregulation in response to combined ABT-737+CCI-779 in the CEM-R cell line. These effects, however, were not seen in the parental CEM-S cell line. Primary cells, obtained from 10 ALL patients, showed an increase of the sub-G1 peak in 7/10 and in 4/10 samples, after exposure to ABT-737 (50nM) and CCI-779 (5000 nM), while synergistic effects on apoptosis induction were observed in 4/10 samples after exposure to the combination. In summary, we observed that the combined use of Bcl-2/Bcl-XL and mTOR inhibitors may exert synergistic cytotoxic effects in some resistant ALL models and this effect is associated with CCI-779-induced Mcl-1 down-regulation. Synergistic effects between these inhibitors were also found in a proportion of primary ALL samples, thus supporting further studies of combined Bcl-2/Bcl-XL and mTOR inhibitors, to overcome ALL resistance.
