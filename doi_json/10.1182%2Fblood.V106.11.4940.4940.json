    "abstract_text": "Background: Interferon-\u03b1 (IFN) can control erythrocytosis in about 75% of PV patients and may even induce cytogenetic remission while avoiding the leukemogenic potential of myelosuppressive drugs. However, 20\u201325% of patients discontinue therapy due to side effects. Pegylated-IFN (peg-IFN) \u03b12b, usually better tolerated than standard IFN, has shown similar efficacy but no advantage in terms of tolerance in PV (ASH 2004, abstracts 1517 & 1518). The use of peg-IFN-\u03b12a has not been reported in PV to our knowledge. The French \u201cPV-Nord\u201d group performed an open label phase II study of peg-IFN-\u03b12a (Pegasys\u00ae, Roche Laboratories) in PV patients. Study design: Inclusion criteria were: PV diagnosed according to PVSG criteria, aged 18 to 65, previously untreated, or only phlebotomized, or with cytoreductive treatment for less than 2 years. Complete response (CR) was defined by Ht lower than 45% in male and 42% in female without phlebotomy for more than 3 months, absence of splenomegaly and normal WBC and platelet counts. Partial response was defined by Ht as above but persistent splenomegaly or elevated platelet count, or > 50% decrease in phlebotomies. Failure was defined by persistent phlebotomies to maintain Ht in the target range. Primary objective was determination of response rate; secondary objectives were evaluation of toxicity and evolution of molecular markers (i.e. detection of JAK2 mutation and PRV-1 expression) on peg-IFN. Results: Between September 04 and August 05, the 37 initially planned patients were included. 20 of them had a follow-up greater than 6 months and were evaluable for response: M/F ratio 7/13, median age 49 years (range 22\u201365). Median time from diagnosis to inclusion in the 20 patients was 6 months (range 1\u201365). 14 patients (70%) were either untreated or only phlebotomized before inclusion and 6 (30%) had previously received hydroxyurea. 25% of patients had a history of thrombosis. Median Ht was 56% in males (range 46\u201366) and 45% in females (range 40\u201360). Median WBC and platelet counts were 8.10 9 /l (range 3\u201323) and 571.10 9 /l (range 120\u20131478), respectively. 30% of patients had splenomegaly. After 3 months, all patients were responders, with 15 CR (75%) and 5 PR (25%). At 6 months, 95% of patients were responders with 16 CR (80%) and 3 PR (15%) (persistent splenomegaly in 2, elevated platelets in 1). Only grade 1 and 2 toxicities were reported. Most frequent toxicities were fatigue (n=6), muscle and joint pain (n=6) and disturbances of gastro-intestinal tract (n=3). Fever and depression (grade1 for both) were observed in 3 and 2 patients respectively. Only one patient discontinued treatment due to repeated grade 2 thrombocytopenia. Conclusion: This is the first report of a phase II trial using peg-IFN-\u03b12a in PV. The 95% response rate after 6 months of treatment and only 5% treatment withdrawal due to side effects suggest that peg-IFN-\u03b12a is at least as effective and as well tolerated as both standard IFN and peg-IFN-\u03b12b in PV. Updated results will be presented.",
