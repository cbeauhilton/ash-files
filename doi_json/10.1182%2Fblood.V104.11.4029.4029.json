    "abstract_text": "The changes of tissue factor (TF) blood levels in patients undergoing major surgery has been reported presenting controversial data. Whether this TF is hemostatically active or if it interacts with other coagulation factors, e.g. FVIII, is still unclear, making thrombotic risk and complications assessment for even more difficult. We analyzed plasma samples from four male patients aged 27\u201355 with severe hemophilia A without inhibitory antibodies, undergoing total knee replacement, which all gave informed consent. Initial FVIII doses before intervention was 75\u201380 U/kg. Treatment following intervention was targeted at 100 % FVIII serum levels. None received heparin. No bleeding events occurred during the observation period. The samples were taken at these timepoints (TP): 1. before preoperative FVIII substitution, 2. at the time of first incision (intervention start), 3. at circulation arrest release + 90 s after prosthesis implantation, 4. final suture (intervention end), 5. 24 h and 6. 48 h after intervention to assay procedurally induced TF production. Coagulation analyses were carried out using a fluorometric thrombin generation assay (TGA) in platelet rich plasma (PRP), RoTEG (rotation thrombelastography) in whole blood and a TF ELISA for the plasma samples\u2019 TF levels. Both clotting function tests were started using TF diluted 1:100.000 and calcium chloride 16,7 mM (final conc.). TGA parameters were ETP, PEAK (maximum thrombin generation velocity), TIME TO PEAK, LAG TIME. TGA parameters directly related to thrombin activity (ETP; PEAK) showed no change during the intervention, but a sharp decrease 24 h later with a partial recovery 48 h later. TGA time marks (TIME TO PEAK, LAG TIME) changed in an inverse way, except for the difference from LAG TIME and TIME TO PEAK, which shortened continously after circulation arrest removal. RoTEG was characterized using 4 parameters: clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), maximum clot firmness (MCF) and clot formation rate (CFR). After preoperative FVIII substitution, CT decreased by 10 % and CFT by 50 % in 48 h. MCF stayed unchanged during the intervention and the following 24 h, but increased by 20 % at 48 h. CFR increased by 10 % during intervention, and by 20 % from 24 to 48 h. TF ELISA showed preoperative TF plasma levels from 11 to 271 pg/ml. After release of circulation arrest (TP 3) TF concentration increased sharply (4 times the initial value), which was not detectable in the samples taken at TPs 2 and 4. TF levels further increased at TPs 5 and 6 to 170 % and 317 % resp. Altogether, TF plasma levels elevated after major surgery seem to correspond to a potential risk factor for postoperative thrombosis, especially when elevation is induced after intervention. However, functional coagulation assays do not change uniformly, as the thrombin generation assay reflects no marked changes under intervention, but in the period after(24\u201348 h). Changes in the RoTEG whole blood clotting assay are not dramatic but indicate a thrombophilic shift in coagulation balance also pronouned at 24\u201348h, too. These results demonstrate that increased coagulability after orthopedic surgery detected using functional clotting assays correlates with increased TF levels, but further studies must be performed to prove this relation in healthy individuals.",
