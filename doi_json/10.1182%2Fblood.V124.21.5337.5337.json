    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Considering that cytokines play an important role in immune response and that many infectious, autoimmune and malignant diseases are influenced by cytokine production, we hypothesized that genetically determined cytokine gene polymorphism might have an important influence on prognosis in pediatrics acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Methods: In this study, 95 pediatric ALL-patients were examined with regard to cytokine gene polymorphisms (TNF\u03b1, TGF\u03b2, IL10 and IFN\u03b3) and their potential association with prognosis. Moreover we analyzed the intracellular production of theses cytokines in patient T-cells. Results: TGF\u03b2 high-producer-haplotypes were associated with high-risk ALL-patients (Codon 10: T/T) and with the tendency of a reduced overall survival, whereas IL10 high-producer-genotypes were associated with a reduced relapse rate and a superior overall survival compared to IL-10-low-producer patients. Gene-polymorphisms of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 did not show an impact on prognosis and risk-group of ALL in our cohort. On a functional basis TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 expression of T-cells at initial diagnosis was significantly reduced in high-risk- and T-ALL-patients in comparison to healthy controls. Summary: Cytokine gene-polymorphisms of the regulatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines TGF\u03b2 and IL10, but not of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 seem to have an impact on prognosis of pediatric ALL patients. Reduced capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines at diagnosis may serve as a functional risk factor. These data may help in further risk stratification and adaptation of therapy-intensity.
