    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4307 The von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease, also known as ADAMTS13, is synthesized, in part, by endothelial cells (EC). We previously reported that proliferating EC secreted \u223c3-fold more ADAMTS13 (antigen and activity) than confluent EC, and that this synthesis was transcriptionally regulated (SJ Kling et al, Pathophysiol Haemost Thromb 2008; 36: 233.) Thrombospondin domains, a defining feature of the ADAMTS protease family, in other ADAMTS family members mediate inhibition of angiogenesis. In particular, ADAMTS1 inhibits angiogenesis by sequestering vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (A Luque et al, J Biol Chem , 2003; 278: 23656). Since ADAMTS13 also has thrombospondin domains, we hypothesized that ADAMTS13 might also mediate anti-angiogenic activity. Human umbilical vein EC angiogenesis was quantified by Angioquant analysis of fluorescence microscopy tube images in a Matrigel assay. Treatment of EC with inhibitors of angiogenesis (anti-VEGF, vasostatin) did not alter EC production of ADAMTS13. However, exogenous recombinant ADAMTS13 inhibited angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1 ), in media containing VEGF. In VEGF-free media, ADAMTS13 had no effect on EC tube formation. Preincubation of ADAMTS13 with an antibody to the ADAMTS13 thrombospondin domains 5\u20137 partially reversed the inhibition of tube formation, implicating these domains in the anti-angiogenic interaction ( Figure 2 ). We also found that VEGF co-immunoprecipitates with ADAMTS13, providing strong evidence that these two proteins interact. When EC lysates were crosslinked with DTSSP prior to immunoprecipitation, anti-ADAMTS13 immunoprecipitated as much VEGF as did anti-ADAMTS1, while an antibody to ADAM17, a similar protein that lacks thrombospondin domains, failed to co-immunoprecipitate VEGF ( Figure 3 ). These data indicate that as with other ADAMTS family members, ADAMTS13 inhibits tubule formation - a parameter of angiogenesis \u2013 through its interaction with VEGF, an effect likely mediated by its thrombospondin domains. Inhibition of angiogenesis adds to the expanding roles of ADAMTS13 in down-regulation of thrombosis and inflammation. Fig. 1. View large Download slide Fig. 1. View large Download slide Fig. 2.
