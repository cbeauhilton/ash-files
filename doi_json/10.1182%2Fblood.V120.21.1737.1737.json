    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1737 Background: The somatic JAK2 V617F (V617F) mutation is found in approximately 95% of polycythemia vera (PV) and 50\u201360% of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) patients. Detection of this mutation occurs primarily through genomic analysis of peripheral blood samples of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients. This study demonstrates a novel broad screening mechanism for detection of V617F from myeloid cells in saliva samples from an online cohort of MPN patients and from a broader database of genotyped individuals. Methods: MPN patients were recruited primarily through social media and patient-mediated outreach efforts. Patients gave IRB-approved consent and completed surveys through an online 23andMe account. Participation in the MPN research initiative was free. In collaboration with an uncompensated panel of academic experts, online surveys were developed to collect patient-reported data on diagnosis and results of genetic testing for the V617F mutation. Participants were genotyped on SNP arrays based on the Illumina Omni Express, with additional custom content, including four probes for the V617F mutation. We estimated V617F mutation burden as the median across the four probes of B/(A+B) where A and B were normalized intensities for the reference and mutated alleles, respectively. We estimated sensitivity and specificity of our estimated V617F allele ratio, using the self-reported V617F-positive individuals to approximate the distribution of true positives, and 23andMe members from the broad database (outside of the MPN research cohort) and younger than 40 as likely true negatives. Results: Web-based recruitment efforts led to the accrual of over 900 MPN patients of different subtypes over 12 months. Of these participants, 745 patients have been genotyped and provided MPN-related health history and outcomes through online surveys. The cohort is disproportionately female (71%), with an average age of 53.1 \u00b1 14.9 years. More than 57% of patients indicated a classic MPN diagnosis (PV, ET, PMF, or post PV/ET MF), 19.2% reported an atypical MPN diagnosis (systemic mastocytosis or hypereosinophilic syndrome), 14.5% indicated chronic myelogenous leukemia, and 9.3% of the cohort reported other diagnoses. From this MPN cohort, a total of 345 participants reported mutation test results. Consistent with expectations, the V617F variant was reported by patients in nearly all PV cases (105 of 110 patients with a self-reported diagnosis of PV), and at a lower rate in ET and MF cases (59 of 95 patients and 48 of 61 patients, respectively). In addition to self-reported data, we were specifically able to detect the V617F mutation using SNP array data. We determined a detection threshold for the V617F variant at which 86% of self-reported V617F carriers were scored as positive (i.e. test sensitivity), and 99.975% of young 23andMe customers were scored as negative (i.e. test specificity). Participants with a classic diagnosis in the MPN cohort who carry the V617F variant tended to be older (mean age=59.5 versus 54.6 years) and were less likely to be female (62.5% versus 72.0%) than non-carriers. At this threshold, we detected 133 individuals who likely carry the V617F mutation among a broader set of 23andMe participants (n= 99,700) who were not specifically recruited for the MPN study, corresponding to a prevalence of 0.14%. We estimated the positive predictive value of the test in this cohort, or the expected proportion of positive test results that are true, as 81%. Within the general 23andMe cohort, the frequency of the V617F variant increases with participant age, from a rate of 0.017% for age 20 to 30, to 1.1% for age 80 to 90. We also observed that patients with a high allele burden of V617F frequently had acquired uniparental disomy of chromosome 9p, as determined from calculated heterozygosity scores and no-call rates for this chromosomal arm. Conclusion: We can detect V617F with high specificity and sensitivity from myeloid cells in saliva. This non-invasive source for DNA extraction offers new possibilities for detecting genomic alterations and for finding novel genetic associations in MPN patients as well as the general population. This study demonstrates the feasibility of online technology to significantly accelerate recruitment and research progress in MPNs and other rare diseases.
