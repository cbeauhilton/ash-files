    "abstract_text": "Introduction Older patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation may experience a higher degree of morbidity and limitations from transplant related complications. Chronic graft-versus \u2013host disease (GVHD) causes a significant reduction in patients\u2019 quality of life (QOL), physical functioning, and functional status. However, it is not known if moderate to severe chronic GVHD has a worse impact on QOL, or survival outcomes for older patients. Methods We analyzed data of patients with moderate or severe chronic GVHD (N=522, 1661 follow-up visits, a total of 2,183 visits) from the Chronic GVHD Consortium, a prospective observational multicenter cohort. Moderate or severe chronic GVHD was defined by the National Institutes of Health global severity score at the time of enrollment. We examined the relationship between age group (adolescent and young adult \u201cAYA\u201d 18-40, \u201cmiddle-aged\u201d 41-59, and \u201colder\u201d \u2265 60 years) and clinical manifestations of chronic GVHD, patient-reported outcomes, functional status, non-relapse mortality and overall survival. Clinical manifestations of chronic GVHD were determined by the clinician-reported individual organ scores. Patient-reported outcomes included (1) QOL as measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Bone Marrow Transplantation (FACT-BMT) and the Medical Outcome Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) (2) chronic GVHD symptom burden as measured by the Lee Symptom Scale; and (3) physical fitness as measured by the Human Activity Profile (HAP). Functional status was assessed using the 2-minute walk test (2MWT). Because of multiple testing, p-values <0.01 were considered significant. Results There were 115 (22%) AYA, 279 (53%) middle-aged and 128 (25%) older patients with moderate (58%) or severe (42%) chronic GVHD included. At study enrollment, older patients (\u226560) were similar to younger patients in sex, time from transplant (median 12 months), prior acute GVHD, percentage of severe chronic GVHD, and current co-morbidity scores but differed in disease distribution and conditioning regimen intensity. At enrollment, in unadjusted analyses using all available data, older patients had similar rates and severity of global and organ-specific manifestations of chronic GVHD compared to younger patients, except for genital involvement, which was more prevalent and severe in AYA patients. Although older patients reported worse physical functioning [SF-36 Physical Functioning (p=0.01)], shorter 2MWT (p=0.002), and lower HAP scores (p=0.001) than AYA and middle-aged patients suggesting they have more physical limitations, older patients had better QOL [FACT-BMT (p=0.01)] scores compared to middle-aged patients and similar to AYA patients. Older patients had better psychological [Lee Psychological Scale (p70 (n=16) age groups, except for more moderate-severe skin involvement in the 65-70 year olds. Conclusion Despite higher physical and functional limitations, older patients with moderate or severe chronic GVHD have preserved QOL, comparable disease manifestations and symptom burden, and similar overall survival and non-relapse mortality when compared to younger patients. Therefore we did not find evidence that older age itself is associated with worse QOL or survival in patients with moderate or severe chronic GVHD.
