    "abstract_text": "Objective To explore the related factors of interstitial pneumonia(IP) in B cell non-hodgkin's lymphoma (B - cNHL) patients who were treaded by chemotherapeutic drugs\u00b1RTX, which could provide certain references for clinical diagnosis and treatment . Methods The clinical factors of 92 patients with B-cNHL enrolled from 2003 to 2013 in my hospitol were retrospectively studied, then cleared the high risk factors influencing the occurrence of IP. Results The statistical analysis found that combined application of chemotherapeutic drugs and RTX was the only independent risk factor of IP,which have statistical Significance (OR=9.6; p<0.05) .While the other clinical factors, such as age, sex, past history of chronic lung disease and smoking, tumor\u2019s clinical stage, International Prognostic Index (IPI) score, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-performance status(ECOG PS) score, complete blood cell count, LDH, bone marrowd and pulmonary parenchyma had nothing to do with the happening of the IP.Finally, compared chemotherapeutic drugs+RTX group and chemotherapeutic drugs group by survival analysis, the incidence of IP of the former was higher than the latter, and had statistical significance (P = 0.011). Conclusion The incidence of IP of chemotherapeutic drugs+RTX group was obviously higher than chemotherapeutic drugs group. Addition of RTX to chemotherapy was identified as an independent risk factor for B-cNHL treatment-related IP. Once patients suffering from IP should Clinicians carefully identify IP caused by opportunistic pathogens and DIIP caused by RTX. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
