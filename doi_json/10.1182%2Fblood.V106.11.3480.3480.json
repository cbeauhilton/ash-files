    "abstract_text": "Background: Thalidomide is an active anti-myeloma agent with single agent activity in all stages of the disease. When combined with dexamethasone disease response is seen in nearly two-thirds of patients with newly diagnosed MM. Though initially evaluated for treatment because of its anti-angiogenic properties and the finding of increased bone marrow angiogenesis in MM, it has become clear that thalidomide exerts its anti-myeloma activity through several different mechanisms. While the mechanism of action of dexamethasone has been studied to a great extent in the setting of myeloma, the molecular basis for the activity of this combination is largely unknown. Methods: Myeloma cells from patients with newly diagnosed MM who were enrolled in a phase III trial (ECOG E1A00) comparing thalidomide and dexamethasone combination (T+D) with dexamethasone alone (D) were studied by gene expression profiling. Samples from diagnosis were compared to those at four months following therapy to study the effect of treatment. Four patients who achieved a partial response with T+D were studied and in addition compared to four patients achieving a partial response with D alone. Plasma cells from bone marrow aspirates were separated by magnetic bead selection of CD138 positive cells and studied using Affymetrix HG-U133A chips using standard methodology. The arrays were analyzed using Genespring 7.2 software following GCRMA normalization and genes with differential expression between the two datasets were examined. Differentially expressed genes were further analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis program Results: 549 genes were two fold or more differentially expressed between the pretreatment and post treatment samples in the T+D group, of which 275 genes were mapped to different networks using the Ingenuity program. Examination of the canonical pathways demonstrated several pathways that were altered as a result of the therapy. The most significant pathways included those related to immune function including antigen presentation (multiple HLA class II antigens), and PRG2 (NK cell activator). Several mediators of B cell signaling including CD45, PKC (\u03b1 ,\u03b2), SHP2, and Erk1/2 were up regulated following treatment. Increase in the expression of several adhesion molecules including \u03b2 integrins, fibronectin, VCAM1, L selectin, and LFA3 were noted. Up regulation of IL-6 signaling pathway including gp130, JAK2 and IL8 were noted following therapy. Striking increase in the gene expression for CXCR4 and its ligand SDF-1\u03b1 was noted as well. 129 genes were differentially regulated by dexamethasone alone, of which 67 were mapped to different networks. The pathways influenced by the dexamethasone alone differed significantly from that of the combination. Conclusion: This exploratory analysis offers an interesting insight into the potential mechanisms of action of the T+D combination in MM. The up regulation of immune response related genes are in accordance with some of the mechanisms described for thalidomide. Also, the differences observed between the patients receiving T+D vs. D allows for assessment of the effects of thalidomide. These findings need confirmation in a larger study.",
