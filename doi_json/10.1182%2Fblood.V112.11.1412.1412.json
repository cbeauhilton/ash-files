    "abstract_text": "LYL-1 is a basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factor closely related to TAL. Both LYL-1 and TAL were originally identified through their implication in T acute lymphocytic leukemia. Their bHLH domain seems functionally equivalent suggesting that these two proteins share some biological function. However LYL-1 and TAL diverge largely outside the bHLH region and display a distinct, yet overlapping, expression pattern in hematopoietic cells. The role of TAL on erythropoiesis remains controversial: it is required for proper erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation, plays an important role in the proliferation of early erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) but appears dispensable for baseline and stress erythropoiesis. This minor erythroid defect in TAL-null mice suggests that another transcription factor may replace TAL during erythroid differentiation. Since LYL-1 is also expressed in erythroid cells, we assessed its role in erythropoiesis using knock-in mice. We show that mice deficient for LYL-1 have impaired erythropoiesis. Erythroid progenitor and erythroblast numbers were significantly increased in the spleen of LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 mice while in bone marrow (BM) erythroblasts we observed a partial differentiation blockade and enhanced apoptosis associated with decreased Bcl-xL expression. More importantly, LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 BM cells are severely impaired in their erythroid lineage competitive reconstituting abilities. Indeed, the reconstitution capacity of erythroid lineage with LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 cells was drastically reduced of about 10-fold. Despite this reduced BM erythropoiesis, LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 mice had stimulated erythropoiesis. Indeed, we found a significant rise in both BFU-E and CFU-E and erythroblasts cloning efficiencies in the spleen of LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Thus, we wondered if a compensatory mechanism by TAL and GATA-1 was operating in LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 mice. TAL and GATA-1 transcripts were more expressed in the mature erythroblast populations from the spleen of LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to control. As GATA-1 is necessary to activate stress erythropoiesis we investigated the role of LYL-1 in stress erythropoiesis by treating mice with phenylhydrazine (PHZ). LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 mice were extremely sensitive to PHZ treatment with a rapid and profound drop in hematocrit followed by rapid recovery and associated with a significant rise in circulating reticulocytes and an increase of spleen CFU-E and BFU-E. Moreover, LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 erythroid progenitors in BM and spleen displayed EPO hyper-responsiveness. In conclusion, our results definitely show modified erythropoiesis in LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 mice that parallels the defects described in TAL\u2212/\u2212 mice. Our results suggest that both transcription factors may have partially redundant functions on erythropoiesis, in contrast to their distinct function in HSCs that we previously described. Finally, double TAL\u2212/\u2212 and LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 KO mice may help to precisely understand the transcriptional regulation of erythropoiesis.",
