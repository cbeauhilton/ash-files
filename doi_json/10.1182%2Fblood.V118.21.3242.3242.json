    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3242 Although the importance of the bone marrow (BM) in hematopoiesis is well known, its function in adaptive immune responses has only recently been acknowledged. Currently it is known that the BM contains fully functional CD4 + and CD8 + T cells that can engage in both primary and secondary immune responses. Interestingly, most of these T cells belong to the memory T cell lineage, identifying the BM as one of the largest memory T cell reservoirs in the body. Since not much is known about the trafficking of BM T cells, we compared the homing phenotype and function of T cell subsets in the BM, blood, spleen and peripheral lymph nodes (pLN). In addition, we determined the expression of chemokine mRNA and protein levels in the BM and other lymphoid organs. We confirmed that at least 80% of the CD4 + and 60% of the CD8 + BM T cells have a memory phenotype, and that most CD4 + T cells belong to the effector memory lineage, while the CD8 + population predominantly consists of central memory T cells. Most BM T cells expressed the chemokine receptor CXCR3, the adhesion molecules P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 and VLA-4, and increased levels of CD44 and LFA-1, as compared to T cells from the spleen. In addition, L-selectin was absent from most CD4 + BM T cells, but present on virtually all CD8 + T cells. Notably, the percentage of CXCR3 + T cells within the effector memory and central memory subsets from BM was higher than within the same subsets from pLN. Furthermore, BM contained significant mRNA levels of the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11. An in vivo migration assay using a mixture of fluorescent-labeled T cells from CXCR3-deficient mice and control mice indicated however that during homeostasis CXCR3 does not play a major role in BM entry or retention. These data suggest that CXCR3 expressed by memory T cells is rather involved in BM exit, than in BM entry. Indeed, we observed that, as compared to control mice, CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212 mice contained significantly more CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in their BM. Additional in vitro assays demonstrated that CD4 + and CD8 + BM T cells migrated vigorously in response to CXCL9 and CXCL10, generally released in high concentrations during inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212 effector/effector memory T cells, but not wild type T cells, accumulate in the BM of mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the BM is a major reservoir of memory T cells that employ CXCR3 to quickly respond to chemotactic signals from inflamed tissues.
