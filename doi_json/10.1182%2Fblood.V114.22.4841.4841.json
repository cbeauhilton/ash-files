    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4841 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of acquired clonal stem cell disorders that mainly affect the elderly population, characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and high risk of leukemic transformation. MDS are heterogeneous in terms of morphology, clinical features and survival. An increasing body of work reveals that there might be differences in clinical features between Asian and Western cases. Japanese patients seem to be younger, have a lower frequency of refractory anemia (RA) with ringed sideroblast (RARS) and a higher frequency of RA, according to FAB classification, as well as different prognostic factors such as the frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities. Incidence rates for MDS in Brazil are unavailable. The purpose of the study was to obtain epidemiological data of MDS adult patients who presented from January 2003 to December 2007 in 10 Brazilian tertiary-care hematology centers from different regions of the country. Patient data collected by participating physicians were entered and stored with the use of an internet-based, data collection tool. Blood counts, bone marrow aspiration, trephine biopsy and chromosomal study were recorded. Survival was estimated through Kaplan-Meier method and the difference between survival curves was assessed by means of Log-Rank Test. Death incidence rates were estimated and compared. Statistical analyses of relevant variables were performed. Three hundred and forty three patients with diagnosis of MDS according to FAB/WHO classification were included in this retrospective analysis. The mean age at presentation was 68 years (range 17 to 98). Fifty percent of cases were male. Cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse and pesticide/herbicide exposure were reported in 33.5%, 13.4% and 14.3% respectively. Median hemoglobin was 8.7 g/dL, median neutrophils count was 1,575/mm 3 and median platelets count was 97,000/mm 3 . There was no excess of blasts in 68.4% of cases. Bone marrow biopsy was performed in 78.5% of patients. Lymphoid nodules were seen in 11.3% and any degree of fibrosis in 28.6%. Cytogenetic analysis was performed in 67.8% of cases and showed chromosomal abnormalities in 50.5%. The del(5q) isolated or combined with other alterations were observed in 6.0%. Flow cytometry analysis for CD55 and CD59 was performed in 11,3% and was normal in 97,4%. Near 8% of cases were classified as secondary MDS. The distribution of disease subtypes according to FAB classification was: RA 42,3%, RARS 9,0%, RA with excess of blasts (RAEB) 20,7%, RAEB-t 4,2% and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) 3,9%. According to IPSS patients were stratified as low-risk (low risk plus intermediate I) 55,9% and high risk (intermediate II and high risk) 13,1%. In 30,1% no stratification was possible. In 26,5% of cases iron overload was diagnosed although only 28,3% of cases had performed serum ferritin. The follow-up time ranged from 1 to 78 months (mean: 28 months). Thirty-six percent of patients died and the death was MDS-related in 68.3% of cases. The high and low risk survival curves were significantly different (p<0,001), and, the death incidence rate (per 1000 person.month) was 8,7 (95% CI: 6,6-11,4) and 29,1 (95% CI: 19,5-43,4) for the low and high-risk group respectively. This clinical registry of adult Brazilian MDS patients represents a unique opportunity to gain insight about these disorders and its demographic and clinical features and provide an important baseline for future studies.
