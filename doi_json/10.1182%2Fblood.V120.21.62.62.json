    "abstract_text": "Abstract 62 Activating mutations of MyD88, particularly L265P, occur in about 30% of activated B cell-like diffuse large B cell lymphomas (ABC DLBCLs), the more malignant molecular subtype of DLBCL that responds poorly to standard chemotherapy. We found that the oncogenic signal of mutant MyD88 is transduced predominantly through the Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinase (IRAK) cascade consisting of IRAK4 and IRAK1, resulting in constitutive activation of classical NF-\u03baB signaling. Importantly, using knockdown-rescue experiments, we found that the kinase activity of IRAK4, but not IRAK1, is required for the oncogenic effect of mutant MyD88 in the survival of ABC DLBCL cell lines. As such, we have proposed that inhibitors of IRAK4 kinase activity could have a therapeutic impact in lymphomas with MyD88 mutations. We have identified two potent small molecule IRAK4 inhibitors, ND-2158 and ND-2110, that are highly selective across a panel of more than 300 kinases. When administered to rodents, both compounds lead to >90% suppression of LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 release in serum. Both inhibitors are universally toxic towards ABC DLBCL but not GCB DLBCL cell lines, consistent with the highly specific mechanism of action. The molecules demonstrate good pharmacologic drug-like properties and are expected to have a suitable safety profile for clinical evaluation. Mechanistic studies indicate that both inhibitors potently abrogate IRAK4-mediated phosphorylation of IRAK1 and NF-\u03baB activity resulting from the MyD88 (L265P) mutation in ABC DLBCL. Additionally, these agents suppress secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 by ABC DLBCL cells. A second, parallel survival pathway in ABC DLBCL is engaged by \u201cchronic active\u201d B cell receptor signaling, which can be blocked by inhibiting Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) either genetically or pharmacologically. Notably, the IRAK4 inhibitors strongly synergized with BTK knockdown in killing multiple ABC DLBCL cell lines. Our results provide a solid rationale for the further development of IRAK4 inhibitors for the therapy of ABC DLBCL and suggest that simultaneous inhibition of B cell receptor signaling may provide superior clinical responses.
