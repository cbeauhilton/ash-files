    "abstract_text": "Background : Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) outcomes in the elderly, particularly intensive chemotherapy (IC)-ineligible patients (pts), are poor. Venetoclax (VEN), a BCL2 inhibitor, in combination with low-intensity regimens has shown excellent efficacy in AML and is approved for IC-ineligible pts as frontline therapy. Outcomes and expectations of AML after failure of frontline VEN-based regimens are unknown. Methods : We conducted a retrospective study to determine pt outcomes after failure of frontline therapy with VEN and hypomethylating agents (HMA). Newly diagnosed (ND) AML pts enrolled on 2 clinical trials of VEN+HMA (NCT02203773, NCT03404193) with refractory AML or relapse after initial response to VEN+HMA were included. In 1 trial, ND IC-ineligible AML pts (\u226565 years [yr]) received VEN 400-1200 mg daily with decitabine (DEC) for 5 days or azacitidine (AZA) for 7 days. The other trial enrolled ND IC-ineligible AML pts (>60 yrs) who received VEN 400 mg daily or equivalent with DEC for 10 days until CR/CRi, followed by 5-day cycles. FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i) were allowed in FLT3 mut pts. Overall survival (OS) was measured from date of diagnosis of refractory AML or relapse after VEN+HMA therapy, till death or censored at last follow-up. The data cut-off date was 07.08.19. Results : Between November 2014 and February 2019, out of 103 ND AML pts treated with VEN+HMA, 41 pts were identified to have refractory AML, or relapse after VEN+HMA. The median age was 74 yrs (range 62-85), 12 pts (29%) had sAML, 7 pts (17%) had therapy-related AML, 33 pts (81%) had ELN adverse risk AML, 16 pts (39%) had TP53 mut , 12 pts (29%) had N/KRAS mut , and 5 pts (12%) had FLT3 -ITD ( Table 1, Fig 1 ). Pts had received a median of 4 cycles of VEN+HMA (range 1-29). The median follow-up duration for all pts was 21.2 months (mo). With frontline VEN+ HMA, 19 pts (46%) achieved CR, 11 pts (27%) achieved CRi, 3 pts (7%) achieved morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS), and 8 pts (20%) had primary refractory disease. Pts obtaining initial response relapsed after a median duration of response (DOR) of 5.3 mo (range 0.9-34.1). After VEN+ HMA failure, median OS for all 41 pts was 2.4 mo (range 0.1-21.2, Fig 2a ). Pts who received salvage therapy (n=24) had longer OS compared to pts who did not receive salvage therapy (n=17, 2.9 vs 1.3 mo, HR=0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.88, p=0.003, Fig 2b ). Median OS for de novo AML at relapse/failure was 2.5 mo, for sAML was 2.8 mo, and for t-AML was 1.1 mo ( Fig 2c ). Pts with primary refractory AML vs relapsed AML had comparable OS of 1.7 mo vs 2.3 mo, respectively ( Fig 2d ). Of the 24 pts who received salvage therapy ( Table 2, Fig 2e ), 5 pts (21%) responded; CR in 1 pt, CRi in 2 pts and MLFS in 2 pts. Among 3 pts with primary refractory AML, 1 pt achieved CR and 1 pt achieved MLFS. Among 21 pts with relapse after VEN+HMA, 2 pts achieved CRi and 1 pt achieved MLFS. 8 pts received IC, and 2/8 pts (notably both with NRAS mut ) achieved CR and CRi with CLIA, and CLIA + gemtuzumab ozogamicin, respectively. 7 pts received HMA-based regimens, and 2/7 pts responded with CRi and MLFS with AZA + quizartinib, and AZA + nivolumab + ipilimumab, respectively. The former pt had FLT3 -ITD and NRAS mut and the latter pt had TP53 mut . Of the remaining 9 pts receiving other therapies, 1 pt with FLT3 -ITD achieved a MLFS with quizartinib + low-dose ara-c. These 5 responding pts continue in remission with median DOR not reached (NR, range 0.7-20.1, Fig 2f ) and OS also NR (range, 2-21.2). All pts with NPM1 mut and IDH1/2 mut who relapsed had adverse-risk cytogenetics or co-occurring mutations in TP53 , N/KRAS, FLT3, and/or KIT . Of FLT3 -ITD mut pts, 2 of 5 pts (40%) responded to salvage therapy including a FLT3i. Of 11 RAS mut pts, 3 pts (27%) responded to salvage therapy including both IC and HMA-based regimens. 1 of 6 TP53 mut pts receiving salvage therapy achieved MLFS with AZA + nivolumab + ipilimumab. This pt was also the only one among 7 pts with complex cytogenetics who responded to salvage therapy. Conclusion : Older IC-ineligible pts with ND AML who fail frontline VEN+HMA have high-risk disease biology including t-AML, sAML, complex cytogenetics, FLT3 -ITD, TP53 mut , N/KRAS mut . These known high-risk features decrease likelihood of response and confer poor OS, confirmed in this analysis. The median OS after frontline VEN+HMA failure was 2.4 mo. Notably some pts with FLT3 -ITD responded well to salvage regimens with FLT3i. Novel therapies to abrogate VEN resistance, especially in high risk genotypes, are urgently needed.
