    "abstract_text": "Aplastic anemia is a bone-marrow-failure syndrome characterized by low blood-cell counts and a fatty bone marrow. In most cases, no obvious etiological factor can be identified, but clinical responses to immunosuppressive treatment (IST) strongly suggest an immune pathophysiology. Our previous study of T-cell receptor (TCR) V\u03b2 (variable region of \u03b2-chain) repertoire usage by flow cytometry suggested that aplastic anemia results from antigen-specific lymphocyte attack on hematopoietic progenitors ( Risitano et al. Lancet  2004 ; 364 : 355 ). In the current work, 7 patients were investigated for V\u03b2 pattern expression before first immunosuppresive treatment, at the remission, and again on relapse. The TCR V\u03b2 repertoire was analyzed for CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, separately, by flow cytometry, using a monoclonal antibody set of 22 different V\u03b2 chains. Most patients had very different patterns of V\u03b2 usage from healthy individuals, and all but one showed expansion of at least one V\u03b2 family before immunosuppressive treatment (V\u03b2 family expansions were defined as 2 standard deviations (SD) from the means in controls). The median number of expanded V\u03b2 families was 4 per patient among CD8CD28 dim effector cells. At remission, almost all the initially expanded V\u03b2 subfamilies decreased to less than 2SD of controls. At relapse, most of the expanded V\u03b2 subsets were increased again. However, 5/7 patients showed new expanded V\u03b2 subsets at recurrence of cytopenias, suggesting antigenic spread of new epitopes recognized by immune systems. Although no common pattern of specific expanded V\u03b2 subsets could be identified among different patients, some V\u03b2 subfamilies appeared to be more frequently involved (V\u03b2 5.1 and V\u03b2 5.2 were expanded in 4 of 7 patients both at initial presentation and relapse ). These data suggest that monitoring V\u03b2 subsets in aplastic anemia, and potentially in other immune-mediated human diseases of a similar pathophysiology could be used to guide individual therapeutic decisions and in the development of new treatments."
