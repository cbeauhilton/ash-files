    "abstract_text": "Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignant disease in children. The disease results from accumulation of mutations of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Recently, higher resolution SNP-chips (50,000\u2013500,000 probes) have been developed allowing us to identify genes involved at the start sites of deletions/duplications. This permitted us both to identify unbalanced translocations involving t(1;19)(q23;p13) (TCF3/PBX1) and t(12;21)(p13;q11) (ETV6/RUNX1), as well as, to find novel fusion genes involving PAX5 in B-cell lineage ALL. PAX5 gene was rearranged to a variety of partner genes including ETV6, FOXP1, AUTS2 and C20orf112. In each case, tthe C-terminal end of the PAX5 gene was replaced by the partner gene. The PAX5 fusion gene products suppressed transcriptional activity of PAX5 in a dominant negative fashion. We also found a point mutation of PAX5 at codon 26 (Val 26 Gly); and this mutated PAX5 had attenuated transcriptional activity. Expression of PAX5/C20orf112 fusion gene in a B-cell line suppressed endgenous expression of PAX5 target genes including BLK1 and CD19. Furthermore, deletion of PAX5 was common in B-cell lineage ALL (34/339 cases). PAX5 gene is localized on chromosome 9p and concurrent deletion of PAX5 and INK4A genes were frequently detected in B-cell linage ALL. PAX5 gene may behave as a tumor suppressor gene during early development of B-cells and its alteration by either fusion to another gene, point mutation, or deletion may be associated with leukemogenesis of B-cell lineage ALL.",
