    "abstract_text": "Survivin is a member of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) family of endogenous caspase inhibitors. We have previously shown that Survivin is expressed in primitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor (HSPC) cells and required for HSC maintenance and for entry into cell cycle. Several alternative Survivin splice variants have been described that are associated with differential prognosis in patients with cancer and leukemia, however, the function of alternative splice variants in normal and cancer cells is not fully understood. Using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) with mRNA from HL-60 leukemia cells we have identified two novel alternative splice variants, Survivin-3\u03b3 (Sur3\u03b3) and Survivin-3\u03b3-Variant (Sur3\u03b3V) that differ by only 4 bases, however due to changes in the reading frame, they result in proteins with very different C-termini, with Sur3\u03b3V being the predominant variant. We have characterized the expression of Sur3\u03b3V and Sur3\u03b3 in normal HSPC, leukemia and solid cancer cells and evaluated their anti-apoptotic function in cancer cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells. In contrast to cell lines and most cancers, where SurWT is the predominant transcript, Sur3\u03b3V is expressed at higher levels than SurWT in a number of normal human tissues including bone marrow, pericardium, placenta, seminal vesicles, testis and uterus. In placenta and bone marrow, Sur3\u03b3V mRNA is expressed at 25-fold and 65-fold higher levels respectively, than wild-type Survivin (SurWT). Sur3\u03b3V is expressed at ~16-fold higher levels in CD34 + HSPC and at ~80-fold higher level in primary CD34 + CD38 \u2212 HSPC. In CD34 + cells, stimulation with SCF, TPO, FLT3L was associated with 30 \u2013 55 fold increase in expression of SurWT, however expression of Sur3\u03b3 and Sur3\u03b3V were not altered, suggesting that these variants may be associated with HSPC maintenance/quiescence. Sur3\u03b3V and SurWT are expressed at equivalent levels in AML however, in blast crisis CML, Sur3\u03b3V is expressed at 5-fold higher level than SurWT. Over expression of Sur3\u03b3 and Sur3\u03b3V in Yac1, a mouse lymphoma cell line, confers ~ 2-fold increased resistance to Taxol similar to that observed using Survivin-WT. Similarly, Yac-1 cells over expressing Sur3\u03b3V or Sur3\u03b3 were equally resistant to Etoposide as cells over expressing SurWT. Over-expression of Sur3\u03b3 and Sur3\u03b3V using the bi-cistronic MIEG vector in primary murine bone marrow mononuclear cells results in 1.7-fold increase in total CFU-GM, similar to SurWT. In addition, over-expression of Sur3\u03b3V and Sur3\u03b3 protected CFU-GM from apoptosis induced by delayed growth factor addition resulting in a 1.6 fold increase in the number of CFU-GM colonies detected. These studies clearly indicate that both Sur3\u03b3 and Sur3\u03b3V possess anti-apoptotic function at least equivalent to SurWT. In summary, we have identified 2 novel splice variants of Survivin that differ from one another by 4 bases. Unlike other Survivin splice variants that are expressed at low levels, Sur3\u03b3V is expressed at a higher level than SurWT in primitive HSPC and in some primary leukemia samples. Expression of Sur3\u03b3 and Sur3\u03b3V is not altered by hematopoietic growth factors that stimulate HSC proliferation. Over-expression of Sur3\u03b3 and Sur3\u03b3V protects cells from chemotherapeutic drugs and ectopic expression of Sur3\u03b3 and 3\u03b3V stimulates HPC proliferation and protects primary mouse HSPC from apoptosis. These studies also suggest that differential expression of Survivin splice variants may play a critical role in HSC function and differentiation.",
