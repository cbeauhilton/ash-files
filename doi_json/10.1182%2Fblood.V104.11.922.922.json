    "abstract_text": "Background: 166 Ho-DOTMP is a beta-emitting radiophosphonate that localizes specifically to the bone surfaces and can deliver high dose radiation both to the bone and bone marrow. Follow-up data from 3 clinical trials with STR as conditioning for patients with MM undergoing autologous PBSCT are presented. Methods: In 2 Phase I/II dose-escalation trials, 83 patients received a dose of 166 Ho-DOTMP STR calculated to deliver 20, 30, or 40 Gy to the red marrow; 82 pts received melphalan (140 or 200 mg/m 2 ) \u00b1 8 Gy TBI (n=25), followed by PBSCT. As of June, 2004, 77 subjects have been followed for at least 48 months. In a separate Phase II dosimetry trial, 12 patients received two 30 mCi tracer doses of 166 Ho-DOTMP STR to determine the reproducibility of biodistribution and pharmacokinetics (PK). All pts received a 25 Gy therapy dose with concurrent IV hydration and continuous bladder irrigation, followed by 200 mg/m 2 melphalan and PBSCT. These patients have been followed for at least 18 months. Results: Up to 2.3 Ci/m 2, 166 Ho-DOTMP STR was given in the Phase I/II trials; 29/83 (35%) patients achieved complete response (CR) and overall response rate (CR + PR) was 64% (7 pts not evaluable). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median survival is 5.2 years for all 83 patients. In patients who are at least 4 years post transplant who achieved a CR, the survival is 74% (n=27). In patients who achieved less than a CR at least 4 years ago, the survival is 34% (n=44). Dose-related radiation-induced kidney toxicity presented in some patients more than 6 months post-therapy. The dose of 166 Ho-DOTMP STR in the Phase II dosimetry trial was 550 to 860 mCi/m 2, 166 Ho-DOTMP. Currently, 18 months of follow-up reveals no occurrence of hemorrhagic cystitis or > Grade 2 elevated creatinine. A CR rate of 17% with an overall survival of 92%, was observed. In 10 patients who received 166 Ho-DOTMP STR 750 mCi/m 2 \u00b1 10% in the Phase I/II trial, the CR rate was 40%, and the 4-year survival was 70%. Monitoring for safety and duration of response is ongoing in all 3 trials. Conclusion: Follow-up from the Phase I/II trials confirms that 166 Ho-DOTMP STR provides favorable efficacy and safety as part of the conditioning regimen for patients with MM undergoing PBSCT. A Phase III, randomized multicenter study is now open to enrollment, comparing the safety and efficacy of 166 Ho-DOTMP STR plus melphalan to melphalan alone as conditioning for PBSCT in subjects with primary refractory MM who have failed to respond to induction therapy, including high-dose dexamethasone, and are within 18 months of diagnosis.",
