    "abstract_text": "Objective To investigate the incidence of hematological damage in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and it\u2019s relationship with disease state of SLE and immunological paramerters. Methods 155 inpatients with SLE were enrolled in this retrospective study in our hospital from Jan. 2002 to May 2005. All patients fulfiled the criteria of SLE which drawn up by American rheumatism association (ARA) in 1982. Fasting blood samples were obtained and routine of blood, liver and renal function, immunological paramerters (ANA, ENA, Anti -dsDNA,Anti-RNP,Anti-Sm,Anti-SSA,Anti-SSB and C3,C4 constituents of complement)were determined. Acording to SLE Disease activity Index(SLEDAI),disease stata were evaluated in 155 patients and their correlotion with hematological damage and immunological paramerters were analyzed. Results 67.74% of patients existed hematological disorder. Single cell line damage were in 32.90% of patients while 34.84% of patients were involved several cell lines. The detectable rate of Anti-Sm (43.81%) and Anti-RNP(63.81%) in patients with hematological disorder. were were higher than those in patients without hematological disorder, Anti-Sm in 26.00%, Anti-RNP in 46.00%.The positive rate of Anti-RNP were 68.97% in patients with red cell line damage while only 46.00% in patient without hematological disorder(p<0.05). There were no significant difference in Anti-RNP between patients without hematological disorder and patients with leucocytopenia or thrombocytopenia. 49 patients were in progressive stage and 106 were in stationary stage among 155 patients. hematological damage occurred in approximately 75.51% of patients in progressive stage while it occurred in 64.15% of patients in stationary stage. The prevalence of Anti-dsDNA,Anti-RNP,Anti-Sm were significantly higher in patients with progressive stage than those in patient with stationary stage. single cell line damage and renal damage were early sign of progressive stage of SLE. Conclusions Hematological system were easily damaged in patients with SLE and Which was related to disease state. Anti-RNP could reflected red cell line damage.",
