    "abstract_text": "Introduction Allogenic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) with high-dose, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (CY) to promote graft-host tolerance has become an alternative for standard immunosuppression. This post-BMT CY-based immunosuppression regimen has comparable efficacy with other immunosuppressive regimens including cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil. Previously we reported a significant reduction of acute GVHD rate by using MSC infusion for GVHD prophylaxis (n=19, p=0.009) [Abstract 1256, 52 nd ASH Annual Meeting abstract]. So we studied high-dose, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) infusion for graft-versus-host (GVHD) prophylaxis for patients with advanced disease after FLAMSA (where amsacrin was substituted for idarubicin) and FluBuATG conditioning regimen. Patients and methods 7 patients with a median age 38 years (24-59 years; 5 males, 2 females; 4 donors/recipient pairs was sex matched, 3 was sex mismatched). All patients with advanced disease (relapsed or refractory AML n=4, ALL n=2, MM n=1) with a median blast cells 17.4%, underwent allo-BMT (n=5 from HLA-identical related donor, and n=2 from unrelated donor). Conditioning regimen was composed of fludarabine, busulfan, and horse anti-thymocyte immunoglobuline for 2 patients, in 4 patients FLAMSA was applied, and 1 patient has no conditioning regimen at all (he was in profound prolonged aplasia after previous course of chemotherapy). For GVHD prophylaxis CY at dose 50 mg/kg daily at day +3 (n=2) and at day +3,+4 (n=5) was used. All patients also received MSC for acute GVHD prophylaxis at day of recovery (WBC>1*10 9 /l) at dose 1*10 6 /kg. No other immunosuppression was used. Results Neutrophil engraftment was achieved at a median day +20 (range from 17 to 44 days). Acute GVHD occurred in 3 patients (43%) at a median day +45; all cases were Grade 2-3 (with only skin n=2; and with skin and liver involvement n=1); there was only 1 patient with late refractory GVHD in this study treated with prednisone at a dose 2 mg/kg; all other patients responded to initial treatment with cyclosporine A at 3 mg/kg. Overall mortality rate was 42.6%. 1 patient died in CR at day +60 due veno-occlusive disease (TRM - 14%). Relapses occurred in 2 patients (28.6%) at a 3,8 and 2.4 months. The overall survival is 51.4% with a median of follow-up 3,9 month. Conclusion Despite the fact that we study small group use of cyclophosphamide with MSC for GVHD prophylaxis is a very attractive approach for patients with advanced disease, and needs further investigation.
