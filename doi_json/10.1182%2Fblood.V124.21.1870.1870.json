    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Mutations (mut) in the Calreticulin gene ( CALR ) were recently described in BCR-ABL1 -negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). They occur frequently in essential thrombocythemia (ET; 15-30%) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF; 25-35%), but not in cases with polycythemia vera (PV). Other well-known mutations in ET and PMF are JAK2 V617F (50-60%) and MPL W515 (5-10%). These three mutations are nearly mutually exclusive of each other. Furthermore, also chromosomal aberrations are frequently detected in PMF (40%), whereas they are rare in ET (3%). However, no association of CALR mut with any cytogenetic aberration has been reported yet. Aims: Investigate CALR mut and JAK2 V617F in cytogenetic subgroups of BCR-ABL1- negative MPN. Patients: We studied 220 patients with cytomorphological confirmed BCR-ABL1 -negative MPN excluding PV and with following chromosomal aberrations: del(20q) (n=64), trisomy 8 (+8; n=57), +1q (n=30), del(5q) (n=25), del(13q) (n=23), monosomy 7/del(7q) (-7/del(7q); n=21). Of these 220 cases, 25 and 12 patients were in accelerated and blastic phase, respectively. The cohort comprised 85 females (38.6%) and 135 males (61.4%). Median hemoglobin (Hb) level was 12.3 g/dl (range: 6.0 - 17.8 g/dl, n=167), platelet count 277,500x10 9 /L (range: 16,000 \u20131,877,000x10 9 /L; n=170) and white blood cell (WBC) count 16,000 x10 9 /L (range: 1,600 -305,000 x10 9 /L, n=181). Methods: Chromosome banding analysis was performed using standard G-banding. Screening for CALR mut was done by fragment analysis and subsequent Sanger sequencing of positive cases. JAK2 V617F and MPL W515 were analyzed by melting curve analysis. MPL W515 was only analyzed in CALR / JAK2 V617F-negative patients. Results: All 220 patients were screened for CALR mut and JAK2V617F . The frequency of CALR mut was 16.8% (37/220) and of JAK2 V617F 58.2% (128/220). Mutations in these two genes were mutually exclusive (p<0.001). MPL W515 occurred in 3/55 (5.5%) of CALR / JAK2 V617F-negative cases. CALR mutations presented as type 1 (p.Leu367Thrfs*46) in 56.8% (21/37) and as type 2 (p.Lys385Asnfs*47) in 27.0% (10/37) according to the nomenclature of Klampfl et al. (NEJM, 2013). The remaining 6 cases represented different mutation types all resulting in the same C-terminus of the mutated CALR protein. Analysis of gene mutations and cytogenetic aberrations showed that CALR mut associated significantly with del(13q) (with vs. without: 10/23, 43.5% vs. 27/197, 13.7%, p=0.001), whereas they were rare in +8 patients (2/57, 3.5% vs. 35/163, 21.5%, p=0.001; Figure 1 ). Additionally, no CALR mut was detected in patients with -7/del(7q) (0/21, 0% vs. 37/199, 18.6%, p=0.029). For JAK2 V617F an association with del(20q) was detected (44/64, 68.8% vs. 84/156, 53.8%, p=0.050). Exclusion of MPN in accelerated or blastic phase from analyses resulted in the same associations between distinct cytogenetic abnormalities and CALR mut. Only the negative correlation to chromosome 7 aberrations lost its significance, probably due to low case numbers (0/9, 0% vs. 28/174, 16.1%, n.s.). For JAK2 V617F the association with del(20q) was still present, even though the statistical significance was lost (37/55, 67.3% vs. 77/132, 58.3%, n.s.). Furthermore, we analyzed the distribution between type 1 and type 2 CALR mutations (n=31) in cytogenetic subgroups. Type 1 mutations were more frequent in cases with del(13q) (9/9, 100.0% vs. 12/22, 54.5%, p=0.030), whereas the frequency of type 2 mutations was higher in del(20q) (6/10, 60.0% vs. 4/21, 19.0%, p=0.040). Analysis of clinical data showed that CALR mut vs. wild-type patients had lower Hb levels (mean: 10.9 vs. 12.1 g/dl, p=0.019) and JAK2 V617F cases had lower WBC counts vs. JAK2 V617F-negative patients (19,308 vs. 30,786 x10 9 /L, p=0.041). Additionally, Hb levels were higher in JAK2 V617F patients compared to cases with CALR mut (12.2 vs. 10.9 g/dl, p=0.017). Conclusions: The highest CALR mutation frequency was observed in del(13q) cases (43.5%) and nearly all of them were type 1 mutations (90.0%). In contrast, CALR mut were rare in the cytogenetic subgroups with +8 and -7/del(7q). The highest JAK2 V617F frequency was detected in patients with del(20q) (68.8%). Thus, in PMF and ET specific patterns are detectable based on cytogenetic and molecular data. Figure 1: View large Download slide Distribution of gene mutations in cytogenetic subgroups.
