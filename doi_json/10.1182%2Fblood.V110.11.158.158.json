    "abstract_text": "To date, Wilms\u2019 tumor protein (WT1) is acknowledged as a valuable target for active specific immunotherapy in several solid and hematological malignancies, such as leukemia. Preclinical data from our laboratory and that of Hans Stauss have already shown that WT1 RNA-electroporated dendritic cells (DC) stimulate WT1-specific T cells in vitro ( Van Driessche A et al. Leukemia  2005 ; 19 : 1863 \u20131871 ). Therefore, we started a phase I/II dose-escalation trial in which patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in remission received intradermal injections with WT1 RNA-loaded DC. Feasibility, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine were investigated. Seven patients received four biweekly DC vaccines. A delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) test was performed 2 weeks following the last vaccination. Patients underwent an apheresis and monocytes were isolated using CD14-labeled magnetic beads by CliniMACS. DC were generated in 6-day cultures in clinical-grade medium supplemented with serum, GM-CSF and IL-4 and maturated with PGE 2 and TNF-a. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was added during maturation as a CD4+ helper antigen. Mature DC were harvested, electroporated with WT1 mRNA and used as vaccines. Patients were monitored for minimal residual disease (MRD) by analyzing WT1 RNA expression in peripheral blood by qRT-PCR. When the patient was HLA-A2+, tetramer staining was performed to detect WT1-specific CD8+ T cells. Before and after the vaccination cycle, peripheral blood was collected for immunomonitoring purposes. There was successful DC generation and vaccine production in all patients selected. No serious adverse events or toxicity was seen and all vaccinations were well tolerated. A decrease in WT1 RNA expression was observed during the course of the vaccination in 3/5 patients who had an increased WT1 mRNA level in peripheral blood at the start of DC vaccination. A vaccine-specific immune response was demonstrated in 7/7 patients by an in vivo DTH reaction both to KLH as well as to WT1. By tetramer analysis, detectable levels of WT1-specific CD8+ T cells could be demonstrated during the course of the vaccination both in the peripheral blood as well as in the expanded DTH-infiltrating T cells from the skin biopsies. Preliminary data from immunomonitoring in pre- and post-vaccination T cell samples from 3 patients show a mixed T helper (Th)1/Th2 response towards the KLH and the WT1 protein following vaccination. We conclude that vaccination of AML remission patients with WT1 RNA-loaded DC is feasible and safe. Furthermore, the vaccine elicits anti-vaccine T-cell responses in vivo and a decrease in WT1 RNA expression levels was observed during MRD monitoring in some vaccinated patients."
