    "abstract_text": "Background and objective: Blood loss associated with total lower-extremity joint arthroplasty (TJA) often results in postoperative anemia and need for red blood cell transfusions (RBCT). We report the results of a quality improvement initiative to improve blood management and decrease transfusions in patients undergoing TJA in one tertiary hospital. Methods: Pre and post analysis after the implementation of a multifaceted intervention which included preoperative assessment for anemia, use of tranexamic acid, discouragement of autologous pre-operative blood collection and institution of more restrictive RBCT protocols. The results were stratified into three periods: I - pre-interventional (01/01/2013 -09/30/2013); II - peri-interventional (10/01/2013 -04/30/2014); and III - post-interventional (05/01/2014 -12/31/2014). We used fractional logistic regression with robust standard errors and regression modeling was configured using a segmented, or \"piecewise\", approach in which slope coefficients in each period were estimated. Results: During the study period 2511 patients underwent surgery. Compared with the pre-intervention period, the total number of RBC units transfused decreased from a total of 587 in the pre- to 107 in the post-intervention period (81.8% decrease). The percentage of patients receiving transfusion declined from 36.7% in pre-implementation period to 8.8% to post-intervention period. Depending upon the costing methodology used, annualized savings in RBC expenditure between time period 1 and 3 ranged from a low of $108,000 using the acquisition cost per unit (~$225/unit) to $480,000 when using activity based costing (~$1000/unit). Mean length of stay (days) and 30-day readmission rates remained stable during the study period. Conclusions: A multidisciplinary approach with proactive involvement of all the interested parties can be successful and sustainable in reducing RBCT and its associated costs, in patients undergoing TJA.
