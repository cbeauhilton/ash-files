    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4484 Introduction Several studies have demonstrated, that TNF \u03b1 and its receptors (sTNFR) can be used as prognostic markers for major transplant related complications (TRC) after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Measurement of that inflammatory cytokine and sTNFR during pretransplant conditioning and early after transplantation may also reflect the conditioning-induced tissue damage. Patients and methods Our study included a group of 36 adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in complete remission, who underwent alloHSCT following standard myeloablative conditioning according to Bu/Cy protocol (17 patients) or reduced-toxicity myeloablative conditioning with treosulfan-based regimens (19 patients). 21 patients received alloHSCT from a sibling and 15 from an unrelated donor. The expression of TNF-\u03b1, TNFRI and TNFRII were analyzed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) before the start of conditioning, on the day of transplantation and on day 30 after alloHSCT. We examined \u03b2-actin as well, which constitutes an endogenous amplification control and is a housekeeping gene. sTNFRI and sTNFRII serum levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at the same defined time points before and after alloHSCT. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate the significance of differences between the analyzed groups and the Shapiro-Wilk and Lilliefords tests to estimate data distribution. Results TNFRII mRNA was not detected in PBMC, but TNF-\u03b1 and TNFRI mRNA as well as \u03b2-actin were discovered. The real time PCR showed significant decrease (p<0.004) in TNFRI expression on day 30 after transplantation in comparison to day 0. On day 30 expression of TNFRI was higher in patients treated with Treosulfan-based regimens than in patients treated with Bu/Cy (p=0.027). Plasma levels of sTNFRI and sTNFRII observed on day 0 and 30 were significantly elevated (p<0.05) compared with the levels prior to conditioning. Conclusion Our data indicate that sTNFRI and sTNFRII can be investigated as the markers reflecting the toxicity of the conditioning regimens in AML patients undergoing alloHSCT. The associations between TNF-\u03b1, TNFRI expression, serum levels of sTNFR and the clinical outcome after alloHSCT should be evaluated. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
