    "abstract_text": "Abstract 935 Lytic bone disease is a frequent complication of multiple myeloma (MM). Biochemical markers of bone metabolism provide information on bone dynamics and reflect activity in the bones. Several studies show that different bone markers are altered in myeloma patients, reflect the extent of bone disease and correlate with survival in the conventional chemotherapy era. Nevertheless, there is almost no information about their impact on the survival of myeloma patients who are treated upfront with novel agents. To address this issue we studied 122 consecutive, unselected, newly diagnosed patients with symptomatic MM (66M/56F, median age 71 years, range 36\u201388 years) who were diagnosed and treated in a single center (University of Athens, Greece). All patients received upfront novel agents: 75 patients IMiDs-based and 47 patients bortezomib-based regimens. The following bone remodeling markers were evaluated in the patients' serum before the administration of any kind of therapy: i) osteoclast regulators: sRANKL and osteoprotegerin (OPG); ii) osteoblast inhibitor dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1); iii) bone resorption markers: CTX and TRACP-5b; and iv) bone formation markers: bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP) and osteocalcin. The above molecules were also measured in 36 gender- and age-matched, healthy controls. Evidence of bone involvement was documented using plain radiographs and MRI of the spine in all patients. Twenty-five (20%) patients had ISS-I disease, while 46 (37%) patients had ISS-II and 51 (41%) stage ISS-III disease. Fifty-eight (47%) patients had Hb2 mg/dl. The presence of lytic bone disease was documented in 76% of the patients. MRI evaluation of the spine revealed that 41% of the patients had focal, 38% diffuse, 19% normal, and 2% a variegated pattern of marrow involvement. At diagnosis, MM patients had increased serum concentrations of sRANKL (mean\u00b1SD: 0.4\u00b10.5 pmol/L vs. 0.1\u00b10.2 pmol/L; p225 U/L; p=0.011, and as continuous variable; p=0.019), ISS stage (p=0.02) and anemia (Hb225 U/L; p=0.038) were predictive for survival. Our study suggests that in the era of novel agents, only CTX, among 7 serum bone remodeling markers, correlated with survival. In particular, high CTX levels can distinguish a subset of patients who receive frontline IMiDs-based therapies and who have poor prognosis. This was not observed with bortezomib-based therapies, possibly due to the beneficial effect of bortezomib on bone metabolism.
