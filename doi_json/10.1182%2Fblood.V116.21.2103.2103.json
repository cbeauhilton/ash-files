    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2103 Both fibrinogen and fibrin bind to the platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 (GPIIb-IIIa). There are at least two motifs in human fibrin(ogen) that bind to \u03b1IIb\u03b23: HHLGGAKQAGDV located at position 400\u2013411 at the C-terminus of the \u03b3 chain and RGD located at position 572\u2013574 in the A\u03b1 (or \u03b1) chain. A second RGD motif located at position 95\u201397 in the A\u03b1 (or \u03b1) chain may also play a role in \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated platelet adhesion on fibrin(ogen). Recent crystal structures of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 containing either a \u03b3 chain peptide corresponding to residues 404\u2013411 or linear RGD-containing peptide (Springer et al., J. Cell Biol. 182:791-800, 2008) revealed that although the RGD and \u03b3 chain binding sites completely overlap, the \u03b3 chain interface with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is much more extensive, implying that \u03b1IIb\u03b23 should bind more tightly to the \u03b3 chain peptide. To directly test this possibility, we applied single-molecule optical trap-based rupture force spectroscopy to study the interactions of RGD and HHLGGAKQAGDV with purified \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Experiments were performed with the cyclo(RGDFK) peptide (cRGD) and the HHLGGAKQAGDV peptide (H12) covalently attached to dextran-functionalized latex beads via their primary amines, simulating more closely the physiological situation and leaving their \u03b1IIb\u03b23-binding groups exposed. The cyclo(RADFK) peptide (cRAD), as well as weakly reacting surfaces containing dextran alone or albumin, were used as negative controls. We tested whether the strength and probability of formation of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23-ligand complex depend on the precisely controlled duration of contact between the interacting surfaces coated with the receptor and the ligand. A peptide-coated microscopic (1.9 \u03bcm) bead was trapped by the focused laser beam and repeatedly brought into contact with an \u03b1IIb\u03b23-coated silica pedestal (5 \u03bcm) attached to the bottom of a chamber. The repeated touching and separation of bead and pedestal were allowed to occur with a compressive force of 10\u201320 pN and a bead pulling speed of 0.8 \u03bcm/s. The flexible parameter was the stopping time of the oscillating bead, which corresponds to the duration of contact between the interacting surfaces. Varying the time of contact between the surface-bound peptides and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 from 0.01s to 2s revealed that the average binding strength for cRGD and H12 with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 increased to 40\u201350 pN until it reached a plateau at ~0.5s, indicating that the interactions were time-dependent and occurred on the time scale of tens to hundreds of milliseconds. The strength of the cRGD-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 binding was consistently greater than that of H12-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 by 15\u201320% at the corresponding contact times. The probability of the peptide-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 interaction was also time-dependent. Within an interval of contact duration of 0.01\u20132s, the cumulative binding probability for cRGD-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 bonds increased from zero up to ~35%, whereas the binding probability for H12-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 bonds was 21% at the same surface density of the peptides and integrin. Both values were reached at a contact duration time of ~1.0s. Importantly, because a relatively small number of interface contacts resulted in the establishment of \u03b1IIb\u03b23-peptide bonds during the applied range of contact time, it is likely that the majority of the measured bond rupture events resulted from the dissociation of single bonds. Thus, these data demonstrate that cRGD has a higher binding preference to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 compared to H12. Further, they support a hypothesis that the RGD motifs, exposed either when fibrinogen is immobilized on a surface or following its conversion to fibrin, may account for the remarkable platelet reactivity with these adhesive substrates.
