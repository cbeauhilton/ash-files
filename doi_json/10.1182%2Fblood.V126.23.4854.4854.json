    "abstract_text": "Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) mediates the transcriptional functions of nuclear receptors and other transcription factors, regulating the cell proliferation, survival and growth. SRC-3 amplification or overexpression, detected in many hormone-dependent or -independent tumors, has been demonstrated its important role in promoting carcinogenesis. It was suggested that development of an effective SRC-3 inhibitor could offer a promising therapeutic strategy. Gambogic acid (GA), the major active ingredient in gamboges, is secreted from Garcinia hanburyi. In recent decades, accumulating evidence has been discovered to elucidate its potent anti-tumor efficacies. In our study, we investigated the effects and molecular mechanisms of GA on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cell lines. GA was demonstrated to induce cell growth inhibition, G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in NHL. The IC 50 for Daudi or Raji at 24 h was 0.15\u00b10.01 \u03bc\u039c or 0.79\u00b10.23 \u03bc\u039c, respectively. In control, the IC 50 for Jurkat or normal human lymphocytes was 1.324\u00b10.02 \u03bc\u039c or 2.54\u00b10.21 \u03bc\u039c, respectively. After incubation with 0.2 \u03bc\u039c GA for 12 h, the rate of Daudi cells in G1 phase increased from 33.8\u00b11.83% to 64.4\u00b14.4%, with rate of S phase from 53.0\u00b10.14% to 17.99\u00b13.87%. For Raji cells (0.6 \u03bc\u039c for 12 h), the rate of cells in G1 phase increased from 44.34\u00b11.55% to 57.07\u00b10.5%, with rate of S phase from 44.75\u00b12.2% to 38.16\u00b10.87%. The G1 phase cell cycle arrest was accompanied by the down-regulation of cyclin D3 and p-Rb and up-regulation of P21 and P27. GA (0.2 \u03bc\u039c for 24 h) greatly induced apoptosis in Daudi cells (from 6.2\u00b12.8% to 46.8\u00b13.2%), but almost none in Raji cells (from 9.5\u00b10.5% to 9\u00b10.72%). When treated with 0.4 \u03bc\u039c or 0.6 \u03bc\u039c GA, the rate of apoptosis in Raji cells increased to 40.5\u00b15.5% or 76.5\u00b14.5%. The apoptosis was further confirmed by evaluating the activation of caspase3 with western blot assay. After GA treatment, cyto C and Apaf-1 increased, and Bcl-2 decreased, all indicating GA induced apoptosis in mitochondrial pathway. The effects of GA on the regulations of five oncoproteins (Bcl-6, c-Myc, NF-\u03baB, SRC-3 and Bcl-2) were measured by western blot analysis. These oncoproteins have been considered to be strongly implicated in B-cell lymphomagenesis. SRC-3, Bcl-2 and c-Myc were down-regulated. NF-\u03baB was down-regulated directly or inhibited via up-regulation of I\u03baB-\u03b1. The effects of GA on Bcl-6 were contradictory in Daudi and Raji. Because of the pivotal role of SRC-3 in promoting carcinogenesis, we explored whether the above effects of GA were mainly mediated by the regulation of SRC-3. Western blot analysis showed an obvious down-regulation of SRC-3 while the mRNA levels measured by RT-PCR analysis had no marked decline. SRC-3 protein stability examined by cycloheximide assay showed an accelerated degradation of SRC-3. Since SRC-3 has been reported to be degraded in proteasome pathway, we doubted whether SRC-3 was degraded similarly in response to GA. Cullin3, the component of the ubiquitin E3 ligase for SRC-3, was demonstrated to be up-regulated. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 could weaken GA-induced SRC-3 degradation. SRC-3 was shown to be ubiquitinated with immunoprecipitation method, and the ubiquitinated SRC-3 accumulated in the presence of MG132. All the data suggested that GA induced down-regulation of SRC-3 mainly through ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation pathway mediated by cullin3. According to GA-induced apoptosis in five cell lines (Daudi, Raji, Pfeiffer, SU-DHL6 and Jurkat), cells with higher SRC-3 level were observed the higher sensitivity. To figure out the relationship of SRC-3 level and cell sensitivity, stable cell clones expressing lower SRC-3 by lentiviral shRNA transfection was established. We compared the antitumor efficacies of GA in SRC-3 siRNA clones with control clones. After treated with 0.6 \u03bc\u039c GA for 24 h, the rate of apoptosis in SRC-3 siRNA clones or control clones increased from 14.6\u00b13.3% to 44.3\u00b13.7% or from 16.6\u00b12.24% to 63.6\u00b11.99%, respectively (44.3\u00b13.7% vs. 63.6\u00b11.99%, P<0.05). The result showed SRC-3 knockdown was accompanied with reduction of sensitivity, further confirming SRC-3 as a critical target of GA. Taken together, our results demonstrated the potent antitumor efficacies of GA on NHL and revealed that SRC-3 ubiquitination, mediated by Cullin3, played a critical role in this process, providing the molecular basis for the clinical trial in lymphoma.
