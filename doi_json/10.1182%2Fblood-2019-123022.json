    "abstract_text": "Introduction A novel approach that can cover the therapeutic gap in NHL treatment are the autologous T cells, expressing Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CAR-T cells) against tumor markers. Such clinical-grade products based on Lenti (LV) or Retro- vectors have hit the market. An alternative vector system for CAR gene transfer in T-cells are Foamy Viruses (FV). To evaluate the potential of FV vectors in CAR-T cell development, we synthesized an antiCD19 scFv cDNA and cloned it in both an FV and an LV backbone; both vectors were tested in paired experiments Material and Methods The anti-CD19 CAR was under the control of the EF1a promoter; EGFP expression was under the control of an IRES2 element. The anti-CD19 CAR sequence was deduced from published data. FV vectors were made with a 4-plasmid vector system in 293T cells. 2 nd generation LV vectors were purchased from Addgene. Cord blood (CB), healthy donor peripheral blood (PB) and CLL patients' PB was used as a source for CD3+ cells using immunomagnetic enrichment. Informed consent has been obtained in all cases of human sample use. T cells were activated by antiCD3/CD28 beads and transduced with antiCD19 LV or FV vectors. Transduction efficiency was assayed by flow cytometry (FCM) using a PE-conjugated anti-mouse Fab antibody. FV and LV CAR-T cells were expanded with Rapid Expansion Protocol (REP) and their cytotoxicity assays was evaluated against the CD19+ cell lines Raji and Daudi. The CLL patient derived CAR-Ts were evaluated against autologous B cells. Cytotoxicity was evaluated with an FCM protocol using CFSE-stained target cells vs unstained effector CARTs in different ratios. At the end of the incubation cells were stained with 7AAD to discriminate against live/dead cells. CAR-T cell activation was also assayed by INF-\u03b3 ELISA, following cocultures with target cells at a ratio of 1:1 for 24h. Results Vector titers: LV vector titers were between 3-5x10^5 TU/ml for both LV vectors (with or without EGFP cassette). FV vector titers were between 2-4x10^5 TU/ml regardless of the presence of the EGFP cassette. Tx efficiency: FV can mediate efficient gene transfer on T cells in the presence of heparin at an effective dose of 20-40 U/ml using a spinoculation technique. Transduction efficiency ranged from 40-65% at MOI=3-5, and was comparable to the transduction efficiency of LV vectors at a much higher MOI (10 to 30). Cytotoxicity data on lines: Following REP, the cell population consisted mostly (close to 96% purity) of CAR-T cells regardless of the vector used or of the T cell source. Effector cells were cocultured with the CD19+ cell lines, Daudi and Raji at varying ratios. With cord blood derived FV-CAR-T cells, at 4h post coculture we observed a 39.4% cell lysis at a ratio of 10:1 effector to target (n=1). Similar results were obtained for LV vectors. Peripheral blood derived CAR-T cells at THE same ratio (10:1), demonstrated 83.9% and 93.1% cell lysis for FV-CART and LV-CART cells respectively (n=2). Cytotoxicity data on CLL cells: T-cells from peripheral blood of CLL patients were used to generate LV- and FV-CAR-T cells. At the ratio of 10:1, we observed 73.1% and 69,8% cytotoxicity for FV-CAR-Ts and 70.1% and 70.7% with LV-CAR-Ts, in 2 independent paired experiments. IFN as activation marker: In two paired activation experiments, CB-derived FV-CAR-T cells secrete 560 and 437pg/ml of IFN-\u03b3; similarly, LV-CAR-Ts secrete 534 and 554pg/ml IFN-\u03b3. Untransduced control cells, produced 68pg/ml and 12pg/ml for FV-CAR-T and LV-CAR-T experimental arm respectively. Conclusion In the current work, we developed and tested FV vectors for anti- CD19 CAR-T cell production. We proved that FV viral vectors are capable of mediating efficient gene transfer to human T cells. We developed a method to efficiently transfer FV vectors into T-cells, using a clinically relevant protocol with heparin. The FV-derived CAR T cells demonstrate the same cytotoxic properties in vitro as their LV-derived counterpart and the same activation levels in the presence of CD19 expressing target cells as measured by IFN-\u03b3 secretion. FV CARTs derived from PB of CLL patients were capable of mediating comparable cytotoxicity levels as their LV-derived counterparts. Overall, we provide a proof of concept that FVs could be a safe and efficient alternative to LV derived vectors for CAR-T cells. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
