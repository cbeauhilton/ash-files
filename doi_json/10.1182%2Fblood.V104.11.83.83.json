    "abstract_text": "Rituximab (chimeric anti-CD20 mAb) has been recently shown to signal NHL B-cell lines (e.g., Ramos and Daudi) and inhibits the constitutively activated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. This results in the selective downregulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl- xL expression and sensitization to various chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis ( Jazirehi et al., 2004. Submitted ). The novel NF-\u03baB factor inhibitor, dehydroxymethyl derivative of epoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), inhibits NF-\u03baB activity via inhibition of nuclear (translocation) accumulation of p65 ( Ariga et al., JBC 277:24625, 2002 ). This study examined the similarities and differences observed in wild type (wt) parental and rituximab-resistant Ramos and Daudi cells following treatment with either rituximab (20 mg/ml) or DHMEQ (10 mg/ml). In the wt cells, both agents inhibited NF-\u03baB DNA-binding activity, down-regulated Bcl- xL expression and sensitized the cells to drug-induced apoptosis. Rituximab inhibited both the NIK\u2014I\u03baB-\u03b1\u2014IKK\u2014NF-\u03baB and the Raf-1\u2014MEK1/2\u2014ERK1/2\u2014AP-1 signaling pathways, while DHMEQ specifically inhibited NF-\u03baB activity. We have generated rituximab-resistant Ramos and Daudi clones by continuous exposure of the cells to step-wise increasing concentrations of rituximab for several weeks and clones isolated by limiting dilution. The CD20 + expressing Ramos RR1 and Daudi RR1 clones were analyzed for their response to treatment with rituximab or DHMEQ. Compared to the wt cells, the resistant clones exhibited hyper-activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway, increased expression of Bcl- xL , and higher resistance to structurally and functionally distinct drugs; their treatment with DHMEQ (15 mg/ml), but not with rituximab, inhibited the activity of the hyper-activated NF-\u03baB, reduced the over-expressed Bcl- xL and sensitized the highly drug-resistant Ramos RR1 and Daudi RR1 clones to various chemotherapeutic drug (CDDP, ADR, VP-16, Taxol, etc.)-induced apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that DHMEQ can reverse the acquired drug-resistance phenotype in both parental and rituximab/drug-resistant NHL B-cell lines when used in combination with subtoxic concentrations of drugs. In vivo, DHMEQ inhibits subcutaneously transplanted prostate cancer xenografts in nude mice ( Kikuchi et al., Cancer Res. 63:107, 2003 ). Consequently, the present findings suggest the potential therapeutic application of DHMEQ in combination with drugs, in the treatment of rituximab/drug resistant B-NHL.",
