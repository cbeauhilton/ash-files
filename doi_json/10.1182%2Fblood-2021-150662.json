    "abstract_text": "Background: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of malignant blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and cytopenias and frequent evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MDS results from the expansion of genetically and epigenetically changed clones with impaired differentiation and maturation. Primary clinical goals in MDS are to achieve remissions, alleviate symptoms associated with cytopenias, and minimize the transfusion burden. While supportive red blood cell transfusions, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and novel targeted agents may lead to clinical improvement, an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) remains the only potential curative option for patients with MDS. RVU120 (SEL120) is a specific, selective inhibitor of CDK8 and its paralog CDK19. A first-in-human Phase Ib clinical trial with RVU120 in patients with AML or high risk (HR)-MDS is currently ongoing. Preclinical studies indicated the strong antileukemic potential of RVU120 that was often associated with the multilineage commitment of CD34+ AML cells. Moreover, RVU120 could improve proliferation and induce erythroid differentiation of CD34+ cells derived from Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) patients. Aims: Primary aim was to evaluate the erythroid differentiation potential of RVU120 in primary MDS and transformed cord blood CD34+ blood cells characterized with an early block in erythroid differentiation. Methods: Efficacy and mechanism of action of RVU120 and other CDK8 inhibitors were investigated in cord blood (CB) cells transduced with TLS-ERG, a fusion gene generated from t(16;21)(p11;q22). Transformed cells displayed an increased capacity for self-renewal, proliferation, and altered erythroid differentiation. Efficacy was further tested in CD34+ cells isolated from BM of MDS patients and established MDS cell lines. Cells were treated with RVU120 and global transcriptional changes and chromatin status were analyzed by RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq. Cell cycle, proliferation, and lineage-specific markers were studied by flow cytometry in liquid and semi-solid methylcellulose-based media. Results: RVU120 treatment leads to transcriptional reprogramming of transformed CD34+ CB cells. The most profound changes included decreased CDK8 occupancy followed by increased STAT5 and RNA Polymerase II loading at transcription start site and gene bodies. RVU120 treatment transcriptionally represses multiple genes associated with hematopoietic and leukemia stem cells such as CD34, FLI1, ENG and RGS18 and importantly induce the expression of genes involved in erythroid commitment, including regulators of erythroid/megakaryocytic fate, such as RGS18, KLF1, FLI1, INHBA, GATA1/2 and hemoglobin genes. Detailed analysis of transformed CB and MDS CD34+ cells by flow cytometry at early and late time points reflected sequential changes in the expression of lineage-specific surface markers, leading to erythroid differentiation. Conclusions: Presented results indicate strong erythroid differentiation potential of RVU120 in CD34+ cells that acquired genetic abnormalities leading to arrested erythroid commitment, characteristics of many MDS and AML subtypes. Observed differentiation phenotype strikingly resembles effects of RVU120 in DBA cells caused by disruption of genes encoding ribosomal proteins. Detailed transcriptomic profiling strongly links the differentiation with enrichment of genes representing regulators of erythroid commitment and hemoglobin metabolism. Further studies are warranted to investigate the efficacy of RVU120 in chronic anemias associated with bone marrow failures in AML and MDS patients.
