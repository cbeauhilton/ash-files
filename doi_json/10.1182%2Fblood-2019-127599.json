    "abstract_text": "Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) bloodstream infections (BSIs) have become emerging cause of death in patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients underwent HSCT from September 2017 to June 2018, and from July 2018 to February 2019, were assigned as single screening group and continuous screening group; patients transplanted from January 2016 to August 2017 were assigned as control group. Continuous screening significantly improved the CRE gut detection rate compared with single screening (10% vs 1.5%, p=0.001). The CRE infection rate in the pre-intervention period, single screening period and continuous screening period were 1.6%, 2% and 0, respectively; while related mortality was were 66.7%, 50% and 0, respectively. The time from the onset of symptoms of infection to use of tigecycline in survival patients with BSIs were shorter than died patients (24 hours vs 72 hours). For 11 CRE carriers with neutropenic fever, all received tigecycline therapy-based therapy (time from detection to therapy, -3 to 17 days) and did not develop BSIs. These results suggest that continuous screening can more effectively identify high-risk groups of CRE colonization and guide targeted preemptive treatment in the presence of infection symptoms, so as to reduce the incidence of BSIs and improve the prognosis of patients.
