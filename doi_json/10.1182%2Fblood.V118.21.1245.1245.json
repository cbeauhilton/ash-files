    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1245 Background: P2Y12 receptor antagonists have become a mainstay for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Yet, they have rarely been evaluated under pathophysiological conditions apart from arterial diseases. Objectives: We hypothesized interactions between prasugrel and enhanced von Willebrand Factor (VWF) release in a model of systemic inflammation, and compared the pharmacodynamic effects of prasugrel versus placebo on agonist-induced platelet aggregation and shear-induced platelet plug formation. Subjects/Methods: Twenty healthy male volunteers were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled two-way cross-over trial. Each volunteer received either placebo or a 60 mg-loading dose of prasugrel two hours before endotoxin infusion. Platelet inhibition was measured with Multiple Electrode Aggregometry (MEA), the Platelet Function Analyzer-100 (PFA-100) and the Vasodilator Stimulated Phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation assay, respectively. Results: Prasugrel reduced the platelet reactivity index in the VASP assay from 79% to 5\u20137%, and unequivocally prolonged the closure times of the Innovance cartridge to >300s, but also the CADP-CT to >300s in the majority of subjects. Prasugrel not only blunted platelet aggregation induced by ADP (\u221281%), but also other pathways including arachidonic acid (\u221260%), ristocetin (\u221275%; p<0.001 for all), and to a lesser degree collagen or thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP). Prasugrel decreased shear-induced platelet plug formation but VWF release during endotoxemia partly antagonized the inhibitory effect of prasugrel as measured with the PFA-100. Endotoxemia acutely decreased ristocetin and TRAP induced platelet aggregation, and enhanced ristocetin induced aggregation after 24h. Conclusions: These data for the first time demonstrate that strong in vivo blockade of P2Y12 by prasugrel inhibits a broad spectrum of platelet aggregation pathways. However, VWF release may reduce prasugrel's effects under high shear conditions. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
