    "abstract_text": "Alpha thalassemias are the commonest group of hereditary hemoglobin disorders in the world, the most common cause being deletions involving the \u03b1 globin genes on 16p13.3. We found a new \u03b1 0 deletionassociated with the -\u03b1 3.7 deletion in a 3-month-old brown-skinned female Brazilian patient with Hb H disease. The deletion was identified by Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) using the SALSA MLPA P140 C1 HBA kit (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, Holland). An approximately 360 kb-region of DNA extending from the telomeric region of the short arm of chromosome 16 to the DECR2 gene was analyzed, and the fragments generated were compared with Coffalyser.Net. In addition to the \u03b1 3.7 deletion, an extensive trans deletion encompassing 70 to 105 kb of DNA and involving the \u03b1 2 and \u03b1 1 genes and the contiguous LUC7L and ITFG3 genes was detected (Figure 1). The 5' breakpoint of the deletion is located between the \u03c8\u03b1 1 and the \u03b1 2 gene, while the 3' breakpoint region is between the ITFG3 and RGS11 genes. Familial analysis revealed that while the patient's father was heterozygous for the -\u03b1 3.7 deletion, her mother and oldest sister were heterozygous for the \u03b1 0 deletion and her middle sister also had Hb H disease. A polymorphism (C > T) in the 220 probe binding region in the hybrid gene (\u03b1 2 \u03b1 1 ) (-\u03b1 3.7 deletion) was also detected in the patient and her father, causing this probe to have a different pattern from that expected in MLPA. To our knowledge, this deletion does not have any similarities in terms of its breakpoint regions with other deletions previously described in the literature. It was named -- ATB because the family came from the town of Atibaia in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo in southeast Brazil. Molecular characterization of \u03b1-thalassemia deletions is essential both for correct diagnosis of carriers of these deletions and for genetic counselling so that new cases of Hb H disease or Hb Bart's Hydrops Fetalis can be prevented. The hematologic and molecular data for the family studied here are shown in Table 1. Financial Support: FAPESP - 2014/00984-3, CNPq and CAPES/Brazil. Table 1.
