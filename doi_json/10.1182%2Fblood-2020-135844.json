    "abstract_text": "Background: Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is currently proposed as first line therapy in children with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP). Studies in adults with CML demonstrated that 40 to 50% of patients with prolonged deep molecular response under TKI could discontinue TKI permanently without molecular relapse. However, data regarding TKI discontinuation in children with CML are limited. Methods: Using the ELN criteria we identified in the International Registry of Childhood Chronic Myeloid Leukemia 18 patients less than 18 years of age at diagnosis with CML in CP exhibiting under imatinib treatment sustained deep molecular response >MR4.0 (DMR) for \u2265 2 years and then discontinued the TKI. We retrospectively analyzed outcome of these patients and treatment-free remission rate (TFR) at various time points. Treatment with imatinib was resumed in case of molecular relapse defined as loss of major molecular response (MMR). Results: There were 11 boys and 7 girls. From diagnosis in CP until TKI discontinuation the 18 children showed no progression, resistance, warning or suboptimal response or switch to another TKI before discontinuation. Median age at diagnosis of CML was 11.9 years (range, 2.3 to 15.8 years) and median age at discontinuation of TKI was 16 years (range, 9 to 24 years). Median overall follow-up from diagnosis of CML was 107 months (range, 67-209 months). DMR was achieved after a median time of 12 months (range, 3 - 50 months) on imatinib. Before discontinuation median treatment duration of imatinib was 73.25 months (range, 32 to 109 months) and median duration of MR4.0 was 46.2 months (range, 23.9 to 98.6 months). Seven patients experienced molecular relapse 4.1 months (range, 1.9-6.4 months) after stopping and restarted imatinib. Two patient resumed imatinib 3.6 and 3.4 months after discontinuation because of increased in transcript level (from 0.001% to 0.01 and 0.012, respectively) but without loss of MMR. The median molecular follow up after discontinuation was 116 months (range, 71 to 209 months) for the patients without molecular relapse. The proportion of patients maintaining molecular free remission was 61% (95% CI, 38%-83%), 56% (95% CI, 33%-79%) and 56% (95% CI, 33%-79%) at 6, 12, and 36 months, respectively (Figure 1). Six of the 7 children who experienced molecular relapse after discontinuation again achieved MR4.0 at median of 4.7 months (range, 2.5-18 months) after restart of imatinib; the remaining patient achieved MMR but not DMR and was switched to Dasatinib. No withdrawal syndrome was observed in this cohort of 18 patients. In univariate analysis, age, sex, Sokal and ELTS scores, imatinib treatment duration before discontinuation and duration of DMR until imatinib discontinuation had no influence on treatment free remission. Conclusion: These data indicate that imatinib could be safely discontinued in children younger than 18 years of age at diagnosis of CML with sustained MR4.0 for at least 2 years under imatinib. Larger studies of TKI discontinuation in children with CML are needed in order to identify factors predicting treatment free remission.
