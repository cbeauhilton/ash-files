    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Prognosis for multiple myeloma (MM) patients has improved dramatically since the introduction of novel therapies. However, prognosis in the t(4;14) subgroup, characterized by expression of the histone methyltransferase MMSET, remains relatively poor due to the acquisition of a highly aggressive, motile and invasive phenotype and a generally modest response to therapy. We have previously demonstrated that MMSET promotes an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate cancer 1 . While the term EMT is not commonly used to describe MM, we hypothesise that an EMT-like process plays a critical role in t(4;14) \u00ad -positive MM disease pathogenesis. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the association between t(4;14) and an EMT-related gene expression signature in MM and identify N-cadherin as a therapeutically-targetable EMT-related gene in t(4;14)-positive MM. Methods and results: Expression of a core EMT-related signature, comprising 169 mesenchymal genes and 49 epithelial genes, was assessed in CD138-selected MM plasma cells from newly-diagnosed MM patients in four independent microarray datasets (E-GEOD-19784 [n = 327 MM patients], E-GEOD-26863 [n = 304], E-MTAB-317 [n = 226] and E-MTAB-363 [n = 155]), accessed through ArrayExpress (EMBL-EBI). In each dataset, gene expression was compared in t(4;14)-positive and t(4;14)-negative patients using linear models for microarray data (LIMMA). Twenty six mesenchymal genes were found to be upregulated in t(4;14)-positive patients across the 4 datasets (p < 0.05, Fisher\u2019s method). A general loss of epithelial genes was not observed, likely due to the haematopoietic origins of MM. Upregulated genes included key EMT drivers ( TWIST1 , SOX9 , TCF4 ) and genes associated with the cytoskeleton ( VIM ), adhesion and migration ( CDH2 , ITGB1 , NCAM1 ) and signalling pathways involved in EMT ( BMPR1A , IL6R , TGFB2 ). The t(4;14)-mediated regulation of EMT-related genes including TWIST1 , CDH2 , BMPR1A and ITGB1 was confirmed by assessing the effects of MMSET knockdown, knockout and add-back in the t(4;14)-positive human myeloma cell line KMS-11. We have previously demonstrated that N-cadherin ( CDH2 ) expression is elevated in plasma cells from approximately 50% of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients and that elevated serum N-cadherin is associated with poor prognosis 2 . In order to identify whether N-cadherin is a potential therapeutic target in t(4;14)-positive myeloma, the effects of an N-cadherin peptide inhibitor ADH-1 (Exherin\u2122) or shRNA-mediated N-cadherin knock-down were assessed on MM PC adhesion and proliferation in vivo and in vitro . The role of N-cadherin in MM tumour establishment and intramedullary growth was investigated using the C57BL/KalwRijHsd mouse model of MM. In this model, intravenously injected luciferase-expressing mouse MM PC cells (5TGM1-SFG) home to the bone marrow and initiate systemic MM disease. C57BL/KalwRijHsd mice bearing 5TGM1-SFG N-cadherin knock-down cells had significantly reduced tumour burden, as assessed by bioluminescent imaging and serum paraprotein levels, after 4 weeks compared with mice bearing control 5TGM1-SFG cells. Furthermore, daily intraperitoneal ADH-1 administration (100 mg/kg/day) to 5TGM1-SFG cell-bearing mice significantly significantly decreased tumour burden when administered at the time of tumour inoculation, but had no effect on established tumours. These results suggest that N-cadherin plays a role in extravasation, homing and/or tumour establishment in vivo . Conclusion: This study identified an extensive EMT-like gene expression signature driven by MMSET in t(4;14)-positive MM patients. This provides insight as to how the t(4;14) translocation leads poor prognostic outcomes in up to 20% of MM patients. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate a potential role for N-cadherin in MM tumour dissemination in t(4;14)-positive MM and suggest that N-cadherin represents a novel candidate for therapeutic targeting in these patients. 1 Ezponda et al .
