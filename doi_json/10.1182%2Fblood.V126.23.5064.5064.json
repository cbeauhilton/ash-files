    "abstract_text": "OBJECTIVES: To analyze clinical features, treatment outcomes in Thai patients with angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a nationwide multicenter registry of 4,056 NHL patients in Thailand between 2007 and 2014, there were a total of 54 angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) patients. The clinical features and treatment outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: There were a total of 54 cases accounted to the prevalence of 1.2 % of NHL and 12% of peripheral T cell lymphoma. The median age was 59 years (range 35-81). Male: female was 1.5:1. Seventy-eight percent of patients had advanced disease (stage III, IV), 69% had B symptoms, 28% had poor performance status (ECOG > 2) and 61% had elevated serum LDH level. Extranodal involvement was 56 %; the most common sites of which were bone marrow (30%) and liver (19 %). Thirty-five percent of the patients had IPI score > 2 and 7% had PIT >2. Eighty-one percent of patients were treated with chemotherapy of which CHOP/CHOP-like was the main regimen. Of the 43 evaluable patients receiving chemotherapy, complete remission was achieved in 41.9%. Forty-four percent of patients with complete remission had disease progression. With the median follow-up time of 65 months, the 5-year overall survival was comparable to peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS), (28% vs. 37%, p=0.7). On multivariate analysis, response to treatment (at least PR) was associated with better outcome (HR 0.13, 95%CI 0.05-0.33, p= 0.000). Patients with PIT > 2 or B symptoms trended to have inferior survival outcome, although statistical significant was not achieve (HR 3.2, 95%CI 0.36-27.95, p=0.3; HR 2.3, 95%CI 0.78-7.31, p=0.13). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Thai patients with AITL was much less than data reported from the international T-cell lymphoma project (18% of T-NHLs) (Vose et al, JCO2008;26:4124-30). The long-term survival was not inferior to patients with PTCL, NOS. Disclosures Khuhapinant: Roche: Honoraria.",
