    "abstract_text": "Abstract 78 Allogeneic effector memory T Cells (T EM ) are able to kill host radioresistant T cells and host-type tumor cells without causing GVHD, suggesting that allogeneic T EM may facilitate hematopoietic engraftment. We investigated the effects of allogeneic T EM on hematopoietic engraftment and immune reconstitution using a rejection model. T EM were prepared after negative selection of T cells followed by depletion of CD62L + cells using magnetic beads. Lethally irradiated (8.5Gy) BALB/c mice were transplanted with minimum number (5\u00d710 5 ) of C57BL/6 T cell depleted bone marrow (TCD BM) cells. Only 40% of TCD BM recipients survived more than 100 days after transplantation. In contrast, addition of donor T EM in the stem cell graft rescued 90% of the recipients (P<0.01, compared with TCD BM alone group). While all the recipients receiving TCD BM alone were mixed chimera (37.6\u00b114.6% donor), all the recipients of additional donor T EM became full chimera (99.7\u00b10.07% donor). These data suggest that facilitation of engraftment is likely due to donor T EM activation. Upon transfer into BALB/c recipients, donor T EM were activated, secreted multiple inflammatory cytokines, and expressed all known cytotoxic molecules. Facilitation of engraftment may also lead to enhanced immune reconstitution. Faster stem-cell-derived T cell generation was observed in allogeneic T EM recipients compared with the recipients of stem cells (c-Kit + Thy1.1 low Lin \u2212 Sca-1 + ) alone (P<0.01). Enhancement of stem-cell-derived T cell reconstitution was dramatically decreased in SCID recipients (lacking T and B cells) and could not be observed in NOG recipients (lacking T, B, and NK cells), further indicating that allogeneic T EM enhance immune reconstitution through depletion of host radioresistant immune cells. To confirm that allogeneic T EM enhance functional immune reconstitution, we injected BCL1 cells to the recipients at day +7 after transplantation. While 6 out of 8 C57BL/6 TCD BM alone recipients died of tumor, all allogeneic T EM recipients were tumor-free and survived more than 100 days after transplantation (P<0.001). We hypothesize that donor T EM can react to alloantigens initially but the alloresponses can not be sustained upon transfer to GVHD recipients, thus explaining the dichotomy of lack of GVHD with preservation of GVL. To test this hypothesis, we injected BCL1 cells into lethally irradiated BALB/c recipients of Rag-2 \u2212/\u2212 gC \u2212/\u2212 BM and T EM from C57BL/6 mice at different time points (day +7, +14, +21, +28) after transplantation. When injected at day +7, allogeneic T EM recipients survived significantly longer than Rag-2 \u2212/\u2212 gC \u2212/\u2212 BM only controls (medium survival time: 66 days vs. 26 days). When injected after day +14, the development of tumor and survival were comparable between Rag-2 \u2212/\u2212 gC \u2212/\u2212 BM only and allogeneic T EM groups. These data demonstrate that allogeneic T EM enhance hematopoietic engraftment and immune reconstitution by reducing host resistance. The activation of allogeneic T EM does not lead to GVHD because the alloresponse induced by T EM can not be sustained in allogeneic stem cell recipients.
