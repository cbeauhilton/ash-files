    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1611 Background: Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKL), nasal type, is a recognized a rare distinct entity strongly associated EBV infection, accounting for 3% to 10% of malignant lymphomas in East Asia. Recent studies suggest that concurrent chemoradiotherapy was effective as first-line therapy for patients with localized ENK L , nasal type. We assess treatment results with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for ENKLs. Patients and methods: From December 2007 to July 2010, newly diagnosed localized ENKL, nasal type, and treated with concurrent radiotherapy (median 50 Gy; range 46\u201356 Gy) and 3 cycles of dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin (DeVIC) at the Cancer Institute Hospital, Tokyo, Japan were analyzed retrospectively. All the histopathological samples were reviewed according to the WHO classification by expert hematopathologists. Results: Total of sixteen patients was identified. Baseline patients. characteristics included a median age of 56.5 years (range; 30\u201376 years), eleven men and five women, thirteen patients (81%) with stage IE and three (19%) with stage IIE. For IPI, patients with low and low-intermediate risks were thirteen patients (81%) and three (19%), respectively. For NKIPI, patients with group 1, 2, and 3 were six patients (37%), seven (44%), and three (19%), respectively. All patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and eleven patients (69%) achieved complete remission, with 2 partial remissions. The overall response rate was 81%. At a median follow-up of 17 months (range; 2\u201344), the 2-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 54.7% and 61.1%, respectively. Seven patients were confirmed progression disease, and six died from progression of lymphoma. Grade 3/4 adverse events were leukopenia (100%), neutropenia (100%), anemia (19%), mucositis (63%), anorexia (81%), and febrile neutropenia (25%), respectively. Seven patients were confirmed progression disease, and six died from progression of lymphoma. No treatment-related deaths were observed. Conclusions: Concurrent radiotherapy and DeVIC for patients with localized ENKL, nasal type, demonstrated favorable outcomes. We are now investigating what factors indicate good or poor prognosis in this regimen.
