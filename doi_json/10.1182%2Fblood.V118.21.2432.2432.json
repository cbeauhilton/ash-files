    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2432 NPM1 , is a highly conserved, ubiquitous nucleolar phosphoprotein that belongs to the nucleoplasmin family of nuclear chaperones. NPM1 \u2212/\u2212 mice die at mid-gestation (E11.5) from anemia, underscoring the gene's role in embryonic development. NPM1 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in AML. Mutations in NPM1 are found in 50% of normal karyotype AML patients, and mutant NPM1 (NPMc+) is aberrantly located in the cytoplasm of leukemic blasts in about 35% of all AML patients. Furthermore, NPM1 maps to a region on chromosome 5q that is the target of deletions in both de novo and therapy-associated human MDS. NPM1 thus acts as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in the hematological compartment, although the mechanism of its contribution to dysmyelopoiesis remains unknown. NPM-1 +/\u2212 mice develop a hematological syndrome similar to that observed in human MDS, and develop AML over time. The NPM1 deficient model therefore provides a platform to interrogate the molecular basis of MDS. We identified nucleophosmin ( NPM1 ) in a screen for protein binding partners of C/EBP\u03b1. C/EBP\u03b1 is a single exon gene, but is expressed as two isoforms that arise by alternate translation start sites to yield a full length C/EBP\u03b1 p42 and a truncated dominant negative C/EBP\u03b1 p30 isoform. Translational control of isoform expression is orchestrated by a conserved upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) and modulated by the translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF2. We generated factor-dependent myeloid cell lines from the bone marrow of Npm1 +/+ and Npm1 +/\u2212 mice. These lines are IL-3-dependent and inducible toward neutrophil maturation with GM-CSF and/ or all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Neutrophils derived from MNPM1 +/\u2212 cells display defective neutrophil-specific gene expression, including a cassette of C/EBP\u03b1-dependent genes. These observations led us to postulate that myeloid abnormalities in NPM1 deficiency reflect an aberrant NPM1-C/EBP\u03b1 axis. We show that NPM1 haploinsufficiency upregulates eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E) (but not eIF2), which binds the mRNA-Cap (m 7 -GTP) as part of the mRNA translation initiation complex, eIF4F. Increased eIF4E is observed in about 30% of all malignancies. Initial increased eIF4E levels in MNPM +/\u2212 cells likely reflect transcriptional activation by the oncoprotein c-Myc, protein levels of which are also elevated in MNPM1 +/\u2212 cells. We propose that increased eIF4E then induces increased C/EBP\u03b1p30 translation. C/EBP\u03b1p30 is a dominant negative inhibitor of full length C/EBP\u03b1p42 activity and disrupts normal neutrophil development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that C/EBP\u03b1p30 but not C/EBP\u03b1p42, activates the eIF4E promoter. We propose a positive feedback loop, wherein increased C/EBP\u03b1p30 induced by eIF4E further increases the expression of eIF4E. Our data suggest that NPM1 deficiency modulates neutrophil-specific gene expression by altering C/EBP\u03b1. We propose an aberrant feed-forward mechanism that increases levels of both eIF4E and C/EBP\u03b1p30 and likely contributes to MDS associated with NPM1 deficiency.
