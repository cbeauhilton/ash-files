    "abstract_text": "Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is often a fatal disease where after strong induction therapy most patients relapse and die. AML originates and is maintained by leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Failure to eliminate LSCs by chemotherapy is likely to result in disease relapse. Therefore, it is a priority to identify new therapies that eliminate blasts while ablating LSCs and preventing a relapse. We have found that a unique class of compounds in cranberries ( Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.), known as A-type proanthocyanidins (A-PACs), were effective against several leukemia cell lines and primary AML samples in vitro. A-PACs consist of monomeric epicatechin units attached to one another by a carbon-carbon bond and a distinctive ether bond that differentiates these compounds from other proanthocyanidins found in nature. Moreover, A-PACs possess ortho-hydroxyl phenolic groups that have the potential to bind to iron and alter redox status. Preliminary work showed that pre-treatment with antioxidants or holo-transferrin (iron-saturated transferrin) partially protected AML cells from A-PAC induced cell death (p<0.01). A-PACs were also found to selectively ablate leukemia stem and progenitor cells, with minimal effects on normal hematopoetic stem cells. Furthermore, AML engraftment of cells treated ex vivo with 62.5 \u00b5g/ml A-PACs was decreased (90.6%, n=3, p<0.001), while normal CD34+ cells retained engraftment capability in immunodeficient mice. It was also found that a fraction of A-PACs of up to 7 degree of polymerization was more effective than individual A-PACs. This information prompted us to investigate the in vivo anti-leukemia effects of A-PACs in xenotransplanted mice with primary AML samples, and to further investigate the mechanisms associated with these compounds. Primary AML cells were injected in sub-lethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice. Four weeks after injections, when human leukemia cells have engrafted, intraperitoneal injections of cytarabine (AraC) at 60 mg/kg were given to the mice for 1 week everyday or A-PACs (100 mg/kg dose every 3 days for A-PACs) and vehicle control (1% DMSO in PBS every 3 days) were injected for 2.5 weeks. Mice were sacrificed and leukemia engraftment evaluated using anti-human CD45 and CD33. Moreover, primary cells treated with A-PACs were assessed for effects on iron metabolism, ROS, and survival pathways either by gene expression analysis, flow cytometry or mass spectrometry. Administration of A-PACs to NOD-SCID mice bearing AML tumors reduced tumor burden. Mice that were treated with the vehicle control had engraftment of AML primary cells equivalent to 16.1% (95% CI: -6.0, 38.37; n=4), whereas the mice treated with the A-PACs and AraC showed a level of engraftment of 4.9% (95% CI: 2, 8; n=5) and 5.8% (95% CI: -1.1, 12.7; n=5), respectively. No significant changes in hemoglobin or weight were found between the different treatment groups. Moreover, qPCR analysis of sensitive leukemia cell lines treated with A-PACs showed changes in gene expression of several iron metabolism genes in sensitive leukemia cell lines (up-regulation of ferritin and transferrin receptors 1 and down-regulation of ferroportin) and several ROS-relevant genes (down-regulation of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 and glutamate-cysteine ligase regulatory subunit). Mass spectrometry also confirmed that A-PACs bind iron. The results indicate that A-PACs not only target primary AML cells in vitro but are also effective in vivo. Secondary transplants are also being performed to determine the effects on LSC activity. Some of the anti-leukemia mechanisms under investigation include effects related to iron metabolism, ROS or inhibition of survival pathways. Understanding the unique structure and biological effects of A-PACs may provide novel information about pathways involved in the survival of LSCs and provide crucial information in preparation for clinical trials and/or optimal combination drug therapies.
