    "abstract_text": "Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a hematopoietic malignancy characterized by peripheral cytopenias due to bone marrow (BM) failure. Megakarypoiesis, megakaryocyte (MK) production, and platelet release are impaired in in some cases of MDS. Patients often have fewer, but larger circulating platelets, which have abnormal demarcation membrane systems (DMS); the DMS, which determines the number and size of platelets released, is dependent on actin formation. However, the precise role of actin during megakaryopoiesis is poorly understood. Transgenic mice that express the fusion gene NUP98-HOXD13 ( NHD13 ) is a model for MDS and have dysplastic MKs in BM, and macro platelets in circulation. We hypothesized that expression of NHD13 disrupts actin localization during megakaryopoiesis resulting in reduced platelet release and macro platelet formation. To test the hypothesis, BM from wild type (WT) and NHD13 mice were flushed and cultured in media supplemented with Thrombopoietin for 5 days. Following in vitro propagation, MKs were harvested over a discontinuous gradient for downstream experiments. Sternums were also fixed in paraformaldehyde, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and evaluated by light microscopy to analyze MK morphology in vivo . NHD13 BM contained many dysplastic MKs. Harvested MKs and BM cores from one femur were processed and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the ultrastructural properties of the DMS detailed. TEM of MKs showed NHD13 leads to formation of an irregular DMS along with abnormal distribution of unusually large granules in MK cytoplasm. Cultured MKs were also cytospun onto glass slides, labeled with fluorescent-tagged F-actin and Myosin IIa and the cytoskeleton visualized by confocal microscopy. WT MKs in vitro had two phenotypes: (1) MKs with myosin and actin evenly dispersed in the cytoplasm and (2) MK with actin predominantly in the periphery of the cytoplasm. In contrast, transgenic MKs displayed only the former phenotype suggesting that actin localization is impaired in NHD13 MKs. Finally, MKs were stimulated with estrogen and adhered to fibrinogen matrices to determine their proplatelet formation functionality. Our results showed impaired proplatelets formation in NHD13 MKs. These data suggest that expression of NHD13 leads to aberrant actin localization leading to dysplastic MK differentiation and macro platelet release. Understanding molecular mechanisms of abnormal megakaryopoiesis in MDS is important as many MDS patients die of hemorrhagic complications. Further studies using this model system will provide a platform for translational research and should reveal potential therapeutic targets in MDS, leading to improved patient care/survival.
