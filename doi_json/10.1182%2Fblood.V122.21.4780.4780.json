    "abstract_text": "Background Factor XIII deficiency is an extremely rare hemorrhagic disorder with estimated incidence of 1/3000000 million. Sistan and Baluchistan, southeast of Iran has the highest prevalence of disease worldwide. Thus the aim of this study was to assess molecular characteristics of this large group of patients with factor XIII deficiency. Methods This descriptive study was conducted on one hundred and nineteen patients from same number of unrelated families. Genotype analysis for factor XIII subunit A Val34Leu, Tyr204Phe, and Pro564Leu and Trp187Arg was performed for all patients. Results Molecular analysis of this large group of patients with severe factor XIII deficiency revealed that all studied patients were homozygous for TGG CGG mutation at codon 187, in exon 4 of FXIII-A1 gene. Val34Leu, Tyr204Phe, and Pro564Leu FXIII-A subunit gene polymorphisms were not observed in any of patients. In the study population, umbilical cord bleeding, deep soft tissue and hematoma were the most common clinical manifestations and was observed in 82.5%, 53% and 31% respectively. Conclusion Trp187Arg is the most common mutation of FXIII-A subunit in southeast of Iran and probably due to the large number of patients in this area (352 patients), is the most common mutation of factor XIII worldwide.
