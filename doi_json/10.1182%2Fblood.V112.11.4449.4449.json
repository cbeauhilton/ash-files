    "abstract_text": "Limited data is available concerning feasibility and efficacy of high dose therapy (HDT) supported by autologous PBSCT in elderly patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In young patients with poor prognostic features intensification supported by PBSCT as a part of first-line treatment suggests survival benefit. It is not clear if the same strategy is applicable to the older patients. The Institute Paoli-Calmettes database was reviewed for all DLBCL patients who received BEAM followed by PBSCT in patients >=60 years old between January 1998 and December 2006 (9 years). All patients were HIV-negative and received BEAM intensification as a part of front-line treatment. All of them were in a complete or partial response after CHOP or R-CHOP induction prior to autograft. Twenty seven auto-transplanted patients were identified (median age 63 y, range 60\u201368). This cohort was compared with closely matched group of 37 patients of same age range, who received first-line CHOP or R-CHOP regimen without intensification in the same 9-years interval. Only patients in a complete response after first line were included. As frontline autoPBSCT was performed in high-risk patients, the group without HDT was naturally privileged in the terms of Ann-Arbor stage and aaIPI index. There was significant difference in the localised vs disseminated disease (stage I\u2013II: 54% in no-HDT vs 26% in HDT group, p=0.03)) and aaIPI (0\u20131: 66% in no-HDT vs 37% in HDT, p=0.046) between the two groups. Factors evaluated included treatment-related mortality (TRM), overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). TRM in the HDT group (1/27 pts (3,7%)) was comparable with previously published data. The estimated 5-year OS was 75,5% (95%CI 52\u201390 %) for HDT group compared to 79,9% (95%CI 58\u201392%) in the no-HDT group (p=0,75). There were 8 events (1 TRM and 7 relapses) in the HDT group and 11events (all relapses) in no-HDT (5-year EFS 49,4% vs 64,2%, p=0.45). We conclude that frontline autologous PBSCT with BEAM conditioning can be safely performed in patients aged 60 years or above with DLBCL after CHOP of R-CHOP induction. There was no difference in OS and EFS between cohorts with and without intensification even if the auto-transplantation procedure was reserved for the high risk patients. We conclude that first-line HDT with autologous PBSCT in older patients with high-risk IPI score might improve survival in this group and produce results similar to those in the low-risk group.",
