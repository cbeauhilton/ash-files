    "abstract_text": "Fc\u03b3RIIA-mediated phagocytosis involves a number of signaling proteins and lipids, which increasingly are viewed as localizing subcellularly in plasma membrane microdomains providing a framework for their interaction. COS-1 cells stably transfected with Fc\u03b3RIIA were used as a model to demonstrate co-localization of several enzymes shown to be important in polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) phagocytic signaling. Previously we developed a model wherein Fc\u03b3RIIA engagement in PMNs resulted in activation of phospholipase D (PLD), producing phosphatidic acid, which is hydrolyzed to diglyceride, an activator of PKC. PKC\u03b4 and Raf-1 then activate the MAP kinase pathway and subsequently myosin to allow pseudopod formation. In COS-1 cells as in PMNs, PLD in the membrane fraction was activated during phagocytosis. COS-1 PLD was found almost exclusively in lipid rafts identified by the presence of caveolin, while two of its cofactors, RhoA and ARF1, were enriched in rafts. PKC\u03b4 and Raf-1 translocated to the plasma membrane, and were enriched in lipid rafts, reaching highest levels 5 to 10 min after phagocytosis was initiated. Rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of PKC\u03b4, completely inhibited phagocytosis, suggesting that PKC\u03b4 regulates phagocytosis in COS-1 cells; however, translocation of PKC\u03b4 to rafts was not inhibited by rottlerin. Chelation of intracellular calcium with BAPTA-AM inhibited phagocytosis by only 25%, suggesting that PKC\u03b1 or PKC\u03b2, which both require calcium, were not important regulators of phagocytosis. A specific inhibitor of MEK (which is activated by Raf and activates MAP kinase), PD098059, inhibited phagocytosis by about 35%, suggesting that the MAP kinase pathway is involved in, but not the key factor required for, COS-1 cell phagocytosis. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 (ERK2), a MAP kinase, was present in the raft fraction. In PMNs, phagocytosis and activation of MAP kinase are inhibited by exogenous ceramide, and endogenous ceramide levels increase during phagocytosis, indicating that Fc\u03b3RIIA engagement initiates ceramide generation. Applying this model, we transfected COS-1 cells with Fc\u03b3RIIA that had been mutated in the ITAM region (Y282F and Y298F), rendering them unable to ingest particles. When the mutant receptors were engaged, ceramide was generated and MAP kinase was activated normally, thus these processes did not require actual ingestion of particles. Previously we showed that ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P), the product of ceramide kinase (CERK), promotes membrane fusion in PMNs. Here we found that C1P increased in COS-1 cells during phagocytosis. CERK was found to be enriched in lipid rafts, translocating during phagocytosis. These results indicate that signaling proteins for phagocytosis are either constitutively present in, or are recruited to, lipid rafts where they are readily available to activate one another."
