    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1452 Introduction: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of neoplastic disorders characterized by the presence of acquired genetic alterations in hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells. The prognostic impact of immunophenotypic markers has long been controversial. Despite this, only a very limited number of studies have investigated the prognostic impact of the levels of cell surface membrane (Sm) proteins commonly expressed on AML blasts. In this study we analyzed the prognostic impact of the levels of expression of several markers associated with AML blasts and normal hematopoietic precursors, as asessed by Multiparameter Flow Cytometry (MFC) in de novo AML patients (pts). Methods: Overall, 122 adult de novo AML pts diagnosed between 12/2003 and 08/2011 were studied, after excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia. All cases were diagnosed and classified according to the WHO criteria and they were immunophenotyped using an extensive 4-color panel of monoclonal antibodies by MFC, as previously described. Patients were treated according to the multicenter CETLAM AML-03 trial. Blast cells were gated after excluding all other cell populations, as well-delineated clusters of SSC low/int /CD45 dim events (\u201cblast gate\u201d) using the merge function of the Infinicyt software (Cytognos SL, Salamanca, Spain). For each case, the reactivity for the following markers was evaluated in terms of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI; arbitrary units) in bone marrow samples: CD123, CD117, CD34 and CD7. Normal residual bone marrow lymphocytes were used as reference for internal quality control purposes. Cytogenetic and molecular risk stratifications were based on the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations and the molecular lesions were investigated using well established protocols. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and relapse rate (RR) were measured by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and curves were compared with the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression model. P-values \u22640.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results: Median AML patient age was of 54 years (range: 20\u201370 y) with a M/F ratio of 63/59. Twelve pts (10%) had good cytogenetic/molecular risk, 83 (68%) intermediate, 17 (14%) high risk and 10 (8%) pts were unknown. Fifteen cases (12%) had NPM1 mut , 33 (27%) showed FLT3-ITD mut , 5 (4%) pts carried CEBPA mut , 41 (33.6%) pts with no mutations and 28 (23%) pts were unknown. The median follow-up of pts alive was 19 months (range 0\u201397 months) and the 5-year OS of all pts was 42\u00b15%. Univariate analysis of prognostic factors showed an association between higher CD45 (MFI >232; p=.01), CD117 (MFI>259; p=.008), CD34 (MFI >242; p=.007) and CD7 (MFI> 19; p=.03) expression and both a shorter OS and DFS. In addition, high CD123 expression (MFI >248; p=.04) was associated with a shorter DFS. In multivariate analysis only a high CD45 (p=.03) and a high CD34 (p=.03) expression were identified as independent predictors for a shorter OS. In turn, higher levels of CD123 (p=.03) and of CD34 (p=.02) were independent predictors for DFS and relapse, even when age, gender and WBC were taken in account. Conclusion: In this study, we show that higher levels of expression of immunophenotypic markers associate with immature myeloid precursors (CD45, CD117, CD34 and CD7) as assessed by MFC, have a significantly adverse prognostic impact in AML, both as regards OS and DFS. Accordingly, higher levels of CD45 and CD34 were independent predictors for both a shorter OS whereas, greater CD123 and CD34 values were associated with an increased risk of relapse and a shorter DFS, supporting the adverse prognostic impact of a more immature blast cell phenotype in de novo AML.
