    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1749 Poster Board I-775 Introduction Both thalidomide (Thal) and 5-azacitidine (Vidaza; AZA) have single-agent activity in patients (pts) with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), but there is limited experience with the combination. The addition of Thal to AZA may improve efficacy, but tolerability of the combination may be limited by side-effects. Patients and Methods This analysis included all evaluable pts on the Ph I/II Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma group (ALLG) MDS3 study of Thal and AZA. Pts were eligible if they had any FAB subtype of MDS; those with RA and RARS also required clinically significant cytopenias. Pts were excluded if they had previously received Thal or its derivatives or any demethylating agent. All pts were treated with Thal 50mg/d for the first 28d increasing to 100mg/d for a max of 12 Mo treatment and AZA 75mg/m 2 /d x7d every 28d until progression or prohibitive toxicity. The protocol specified dose delays or reductions for treatment-related toxicities. Results A total of 80 pts have been enrolled, with 41 treated between 7/08 \u2013 7/09 currently evaluable. Median age is 68.5y (42-81) with 66% male. FAB MDS category was RA 15%, RARS 10%, RAEB 46%, RAEB-t 10% and CMML 17% with IPSS low 12%, intermed-1 37%, intermed-2 34% and high 12%. Median baseline Hb 88g/L (71-127), ANC 1.91\u00d710 9/L (0.06-87.65) and platelets 75 \u00d710 9/L (10-399). Median time post diagnosis was 9 Mo. Seventeen pts (41%) remain on treatment with AZA alone (n=3) or both agents (n=14) with a median follow-up of 208d (60-297d). For those still on Thal and AZA median exposure to Thal is 209d (60-297d), with a median 7 cycles of AZA (2-9). For those 27 ceased Thal median exposure was 49d (17-220d) and of 24 ceasing AZA, median number cycles was 2 (1-8). Of 27 pts ceasing one (n=3) or both (n=24) agents; 7 withdrew consent, 3 at investigator decision, 4 for toxicity, 6 progressive disease, 1 lack of efficacy, 2 death (1 respiratory failure in setting of PD and WCC>300, 1 sepsis) and 4 unknown. There were 3 additional deaths within 28d of ceasing study therapy (all with PD); 2 due to sepsis and 1 intracranial haemorrhage. No pt experienced peripheral neuropathy Gr3 or worse. During cycle 1 of the first 40 consecutive patients on treatment, there were 18 episodes of Gr3+ non-haematologic toxicity in 13 patients; this was more likely in those with ECOG 2 (67% v 26%, p=0.053), age>65y (39% v 19%, p=0.175) and baseline ANC'0.5 (75% v 21%, p=0.008). Most of these events were infection related (a recognised risk of underlying MDS and of AZA alone); others occurred on only one occasion each (syncope, postop hemorrhage, respiratory disorder, renal failure, abdominal pain, pain, thrombosis and hypokalemia). Conclusions The combination of Thal 50-100mg/d and standard dose AZA is feasible without unexpected toxicity. Infections are common in the first cycle, particularly in pts with baseline neutropenia or impaired performance status. An updated toxicity analysis will be presented.
