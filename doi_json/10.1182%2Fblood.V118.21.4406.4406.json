    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4406 It has been hypothesized that the early acquisition of genomic instability is essential to account for the high number of mutations commonly identified in human cancers. Previous reports have demonstrated that MYC overexpression results in gene amplification. Given the importance of MYC in Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, we investigated the effects of MYC on spontaneous inactivating somatic mutations, using an assay that we have developed, based on the PIG-A gene. PIG-A is X-linked, thus a single mutation can disrupt its function. PIG-A encodes an enzyme required for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), which is required for the expression of a set of membrane proteins on the cell surface (e.g., CD48, CD52, CD55, and CD59). Expansion of PIG-A mutant stem cells occurs in PNH, and it is known from this disorder that a very broad spectrum of mutations can inactive PIG-A . Using PIG-A , we have previously determined the mutation rate (\u03bc) in EBV transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (BLCLs) from normal human donors, and we have demonstrated genomic instability in cell lines derived from hematologic malignancies. Here we have measured \u03bc in P493, a cell line derived from normal human B cells, which overexpress MYC (normalized levels 17 \u00d7 higher than BLCLs). P493 can also be induced to express lower levels of MYC, resulting in a lower growth rate, using tetracycline and estradiol. To measure \u03bc, pre-existing mutants are first eliminated from the culture by staining the cells with an antibody specific for CD59 and sorting to collect the upper 50 th percentile of the population. This purified GPI(+) population is then returned to culture for 3 weeks, with careful cell counts taken to estimate the number of cell divisions ( d ) occurring in vitro . After expansion, the frequency ( f ) of mutants arising in vitro is measured by first incubating with a mixture of mouse antibodies specific for CD48, CD52, CD55, and CD59, followed by a rabbit anti-mouse PE conjugate, followed by a FITC conjugated antibody specific for a transmembrane protein (CD45 or HLA-DR). Live cells are identified based on exclusion of propidium iodide and based on FITC fluorescence; GPI(\u2212) cells are defined as having <4% of the mean PE fluorescence as the GPI(+) population. f is calculated as # GPI(\u2212) cells / total gated live cells. The mutation rate is then calculated as \u03bc = f / d . In initial experiments, 6 separate cultures of P493 were analyzed, demonstrating a median \u03bc of 15 \u00d7 10 \u22127 mutations per cell division (range 11 \u2013 33 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ). For comparison, the positive control, a hypermutable mantle cell lymphoma cell line (HBL2), demonstrated a \u03bc of 674 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , and five BLCLs derived from normal donors demonstrated a median \u03bc value of 37 \u00d7 10 \u22127 (range 11 to 57 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ). In parallel experiments, P493 was also grown in the presence of tetracycline and estradiol to reduce MYC: in 5 separate experiments, P493 growing in these conditions demonstrated a median \u03bc of 6 \u00d7 10 \u22127 . However, in 2 subsequent experiments, we observed a higher \u03bc under \u201clower MYC\u201d conditions: 81 \u00d7 10 \u22127 (SEM \u00b115 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ) vs 13 \u00d7 10 \u22127 (\u00b12.2 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ) and 65 \u00d7 10 \u22127 (\u00b16.2 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ) vs 21 \u00d7 10 \u22127 (\u00b13.3 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ). We then isolated 6 clones of P493: for 5 clones, under \u201chigh MYC\u201d conditions, \u03bc was similar to the previous experiments (26 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , SEM \u00b13.4 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ), and for 3 of these clones \u03bc went up in the \u201clower MYC\u201d conditions by 5 to 9 fold. For 2 of these clones, \u03bc was similar in the \u201chigh MYC\u201d and \u201clower MYC\u201d conditions. One of the 6 clones, surprisingly, did not adopt a lower growth rate in the presence of tetracycline and estradiol and demonstrated a reversed pattern: \u03bc was 70 \u00d7 10 \u22127 under \u201chigh MYC\u201d conditions and 16 \u00d7 10 \u22127 under \u201clower MYC\u201d conditions. We next analyzed 7 cell lines derived from Burkitt\u2019s neoplasms which also overexpressed MYC (mean normalized levels ~ 3 \u00d7 higher compared with normal BLCLs). Here we found a bimodal pattern, as we have previously described for primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples: for 4 of the cell lines \u03bc was < 25 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , whereas 3 samples exhibited \u03bc values comparable to the hypermutable positive control: 229 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , 562 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , and 1786 \u00d7 10 \u22127 respectively. We conclude that overexpression of MYC is not sufficient to produce hypermutability in human B cells, based on this assay for gene-inactivating mutations. Hypermutability\u2013as detected here\u2013is a common feature of cell lines derived from Burkitt\u2019s neoplasms but does not seem to be necessary for its development.
