    "abstract_text": "The development of the complete repertoire of blood cells from a common progenitor, the hematopoietic stem cell, is a tightly controlled process that is regulated, in part, by the activity of lineage specific transcription factors. Despite our knowledge of these factors, the mechanisms that regulate the formation and growth of distinct, but closely related lineages, such as erythroid cells and megakaryocytes, remain largely uncharacterized. Here we show that Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family that also plays an essential role in cytokinesis, is differentially expressed during erythroid versus megakaryocyte development. Erythroid cells express Survivin throughout their maturation, up to the terminal stage of differentiation (orthochromatic), even after the cells exit the cell cycle. This is surprising because Survivin is generally expressed in a cell cycle dependent manner and not thought to be expressed in terminally differentiated cells. In contrast, purified murine megakaryocytes express nearly 5-fold lower levels of Survivin mRNA compared to erythroid cells. To investigate whether Survivin is involved in the differentiation and/or survival of hematopoietic progenitors, we infected primary mouse bone marrow cells with retroviruses harboring either the human Survivin cDNA or a mouse Survivin shRNA, and then induced erythroid and megakaryocyte differentiation in both liquid culture and colony-forming assays. These studies revealed that overexpression of Survivin promoted the terminal differentiation of red blood cells, while its reduction, by RNA interference, inhibited their differentiation. In contrast, downregulation of Survivin facilitated the expansion of megakaryocytes, and its overexpression antagonized megakaryocyte formation. In addition, consistent with a role for survivin in erythropoiesis, downregulation of Survivin expression in MEL cells led to a block in terminal differentiation. Finally, since caspase activity is known to be required for erythroid maturation, we investigated whether survivin associated with cleaved caspase-3 in erythroid cells. Immunofluorescence revealed that Survivin and cleaved caspase-3 co-localized to discrete foci within the cytoplasm of erythroid cells at the orthochromatic stage of development. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that Survivin cooperates with cleaved caspase-3 in terminal maturation of red blood cells. Together, our findings demonstrate that Survivin plays multiple, distinct roles in hematopoiesis.",
