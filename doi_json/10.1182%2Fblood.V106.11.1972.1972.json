    "abstract_text": "Mobilization with chemotherapy (CT) plus hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) is superior to mobilization with HGFs only. For stem cell mobilization after chemotherapy HGFs are typically given once or twice a day for approximately 14 days. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) with DT-PACE plus pegfilgrastim was equivalent to mobilization with DT-PACE + filgrastim. Patients analyzed were enrolled in two consecutive studies 2001\u201312 (N=97) and 2003\u201341 (N=72) and included only patients who had received \u2265 2 cycles of prior therapy, but no prior transplant. Both protocols employed a single cycle of induction with DT-PACE ( Lee et al. JCO  2003 ; 21 : 2732 ) followed by stem cell collection with either filgrastim 5\u03bcg/kg bid until completion of stem cell collection (2001\u201312) or pegfilgrastim 6mg on days 6 and 13 (2003\u201341). Patients then proceeded with tandem transplants, one consolidation cycle with DT-PACE and two years of maintenance with thalidomide (100mg daily) and dexamethasone (4 mg/day, days 1\u20134 q 3 weeks). Group characteristics were compared using the Kruskall-Wallis test. Time to hematopoietic recovery after transplantation was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier plots, and comparison was performed using the logrank statistic. The two studies had comparable characteristics, except that more patients \u2265 65 years were enrolled in 2003\u201341 (35% vs 13%; p=.001). The median number of collection days was 2 in both studies (p=.8). The median number of CD34 cells/kg (x10 6 ) collected per day was 9.7 (2001\u201312) vs 12.7 (2003\u201341) (p=.2). The total number of CD34 cell/kg (x10 6 ) collected was 20.4 (2001\u201312) versus 25.4 (2003\u201341) (p=.2). The median number of CD34 cells/kg (x10 6 ) infused after the first transplant was 4.1 (2001\u201312) and 4.5 (2003\u201341) (p=.5). The time to recover ANC > 500/\u03bcl and platelets > 20,000/\u03bcl without transfusion was shorter for 2003\u201341 patients (13 versus 15 days; p< .0001) (Figure 1). Mobilization of PBSC with pegfilgrastim is easier for patients because they only receive 2 injections and is as effective as filgrastim when combined with DT-PACE. Moreover, mobilization with pegfilgrastim may result in a more rapid hematologic recovery after transplantation.
