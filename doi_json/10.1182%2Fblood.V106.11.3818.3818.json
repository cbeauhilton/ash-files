    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Thalassemia minor is a prevalent genetic disorder around the world. A large number of mutations have been implicated in the development of a \u03b2-thalassemia minor phenotype. The diagnosis of \u03b2-thalassemia minor is made based on phenotypic parameters: microcytosis and elevated HbA2, with or without elevated HbF. We previously reported (ASH 2004, abstract #3761) that erythrocytic parameters of \u03b2-thalassemia minor are significantly different in patients with concomitant \u03b1-globin deletions, suggesting a reduction of ineffective erythropoiesis. The goal of the present study is to evaluate the effect of \u03b1 and \u03b2-globin mutations on erythrocytic parameters in \u03b2-thalassemia minor patients. Methods: Diagnosis of \u03b2-thalassemia minor was established using Hb HPLC analysis (Variant II, Bio-Rad) with increased HbA2 +/\u2212 increased HbF without expression of an abnormal Hb in cases of microcytosis. The DNA of consecutive cases with newly diagnosed \u03b2-thalassemia minor was extracted from leucocytes. A m-PCR was used to detect the presence of 7 \u03b1-globin gene deletions (-\u03b1 3.7 , -\u03b1 4.2 , -- SEA , -- FIL , -- MED , -- THAI , -\u03b1 20.5 ). PCR and automated sequencing using fluorescence-based capillary electrophoresis (ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyser) was performed to identify \u03b2-globin mutations causing the thalassemia phenotype. Data on age, sex and erythrocyte indices (Hb, MCV, RBC and RDW) was recorded. Student t-test was used to compare groups on the erythrocytic parameters. Results: At the time of analysis, 175 samples were fully studied. At least one mutation in the \u03b2-globin gene was identified in 172 cases (98.3%, 95%IC: 95\u201399.5%). Groups were defined for comparison of erythrocytic parameters: mutations causing \u03b2 + phenotype, mutations causing \u03b2 0 phenotype. Sub-groups were also analysed based on the presence or absence of \u03b1-globin gene deletions. Results are presented in Table 1 and 2. Conclusion: The correlation between \u03b2-globin mutation and a \u03b2-thalasemia minor phenotype indicates that the phenotypic parameters correctly diagnoses \u03b2-thalasemia minor in the great majority of cases. Mutations classified as \u03b2 0 affect more negatively the MCV, probably as a consequence of a reduced \u03b2-globin production and a greater level of ineffective erythropoiesis than in the \u03b2+ group. Higher MCV values in both \u03b2 + and \u03b2 0 mutations when paired with an \u03b1-globin deletion compared with cases without an \u03b1-globin gene deletion could be explained by the concomitant reduction of functional \u03b1 and \u03b2 globin chain production, therefore causing less ineffective erythropoiesis.
