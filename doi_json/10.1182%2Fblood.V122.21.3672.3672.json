    "abstract_text": "Common genetic variation has been found to significantly affect quantitative biological traits of red blood cells. One such locus in the intergenic region between HBS1L and MYB genes on chromosome 6q ( HMIP-2) , occupies upstream regulatory sequences for MYB 1 , which is a key erythroid transcription factor. HMIP-2 variation affects a series of erythroid traits 2 , with especially pronounced effects on variable persistence of fetal hemoglobin 3 . In studying a large European population sample and an African-descended cohort of patients with sickle cell anemia (Hb SS), we found that both population groups share a set of two spatially separate alleles ( HMIP-2 alleles \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019) that increase HbF levels, but that these typically occur in tandem (\u2018A - B\u2019) on European chromosomes, while they exist on separate chromosomes (either \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019) in African populations. Surprisingly, \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018A - B\u2019 chromosomes exert similar effects on HbF persistence, suggesting a negative genetic interaction of these alleles when in cis configuration. We extended our investigation to public data from the 1000Genomes 4 and Human Genome Diversity 5 projects, using characteristic haplotype signatures for \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 to investigate the prevalence of these alleles in global populations, without the need for phenotype data. HMIP-2 variants exist in four characteristic principal haplotypes around the world: a haplotype clade without HbF-increasing variants (\u2018ancestral clade\u2019), one clade each carrying only \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 (typical for African populations) and a fourth clade carrying both high-HbF alleles (\u2018A - B\u2019). The latter was characteristic for all non-African populations studied and therefore termed the \u2018Eurasian clade\u2019. This clade is likely to have arisen in East Africa and to have been carried with the original migration of modern humans out of Africa. \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 alleles in either form are infrequent in malaria-endemic regions and might have unfavourable effects on malaria-protective genetic factors such as the sickle mutation. Phenotypic effects leading to the positive selection of these alleles in other populations might be related to their influence on general erythroid traits and on the kinetics of erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. 1.
