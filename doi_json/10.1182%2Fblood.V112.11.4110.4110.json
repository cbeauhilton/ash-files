    "abstract_text": "Objects: To explore the activation state of intracellular signal pathway of mTOR/S6 in refractory/relapsed aplastic anemia (AA); the effect of rapamycin (RAPA) and CTLA-4 immunoglobulin (CTLA-4Ig) on this signal pathway in refractory/relapsed AA. Methods: Samples were collected from 13 refractory/relapsed AA patients [male: 6, female: 7, media age: 27 years (from 7 to 66years)], 8 newly diagnosed patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) [male: 5, female: 3, media age: 21.5 years (from 12 to 58 years)]. The intracellular percentages of p-mTOR, p-S6 and IFN-\u03b3 of CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 + and CD3 + CD8 \u2212 T cells in bone marrow were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). 10 iron deficiency anemia (IDA) patients [male: 3, female: 7, media age: 44 years (from 31 to 72 years)] were determined as case controls and normal controls respectively. After exposure to RAPA and CTLA-4Ig respectively, samples were detected by FCM for the expression of p-mTOR, p-S6 and IFN-\u03b3 in CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 + and CD3 + CD8 \u2212 T cells in bone marrow, in order to estimate the effect of RAPA and CTLA-4Ig on the pathway of mTOR/S6 in refractory/relapsed AA. Results: In refractory/relapsed AA, measurement of p-mTOR, p-S6 and IFN-\u03b3 in CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 \u2212 and CD3 + CD8 + T cells were (42.42\u00b126.44)%, (44.38\u00b124.95)%, (51.89\u00b127.00)%; (6.47\u00b12.72)%, (9.16\u00b12.89)%, (9.61\u00b15.34)%; (18.87\u00b110.05)%, (13.17\u00b15.88)%, (20.07\u00b115.16)%, respectively; and showed an increased level compared to normal controls [(1.54\u00b11.51)%; P=0.000 ], [(1.94\u00b11.08)%; P=0.000 ], [(2.04\u00b12.03)%; P=0.000 ]; [(0.83\u00b10.82)%; P=0.000 ], [(0.91\u00b10.88)%; P=0.000 ], [(0.95\u00b10.93)%; P=0.000 ]; [(4.42\u00b13.55)%; P=0.000 ], [(2.35\u00b11.69)%; P=0.000 ], [(4.73\u00b14.43)%; P=0.004 ]. In newly diagnosed patients with SAA, the levels of p-mTOR and p-S6 in CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 \u2212 and CD3 + CD8 + T cells were (1.71\u00b11.66)%, (2.28\u00b12.15)%, (1.59\u00b11.52)%; (1.23\u00b11.13)%, (1.23\u00b11.07)%, (1.76\u00b11.68)% respectively, and they were similar to normal controls ( P > 0.05 ), but significantly lower than those of refractory/relapsed AA ( P < 0.01 ). Expression of IFN-\u03b3 in CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 \u2212 and CD3 + CD8 + T cells was higher than normal controls with (10.38\u00b13.83)%, (6.11\u00b11.91)%, (13.14\u00b17.05)% ( P < 0.01 ). The percentages of CD3 + IFN-\u03b3 + and CD3 + CD8 \u2212 IFN-\u03b3 + were lower than refractory/relapsed AA ( P < 0.05 ), while it was comparable for CD3 + CD8 + IFN-\u03b3 + cells between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ). Exposed to RAPA, the expression of p-mTOR, p-S6 and IFN-\u03b3 in CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 \u2212 and CD3 + CD8 + T cells decreased markedly ( P < 0.05 ) to (12.44\u00b112.41)% (12.60\u00b112.57)%, (16.85\u00b115.64)%; (1.49\u00b11.45)%, (1.46\u00b11.43)%, (1.55\u00b11.54)%; and (4.29\u00b14.23)%, (3.16\u00b13.32)%, (10.70\u00b110.63)% in refractory/relapsed AA. And treated with CTLA-4Ig could also cause a significant reduction of p-mTOR, p-S6 and IFN-\u03b3 in CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 \u2212 and CD3 + CD8 + T cells, which were (6.40\u00b16.13)%, (8.32\u00b17.76)%, (7.18\u00b17.02)%; (1.08\u00b11.08)%, (2.69\u00b12.37)%, (1.60\u00b11.56)%; (1.67\u00b11.60)%, (2.39\u00b12.12)%, (1.30\u00b11.30)%, respectively, ( P < 0.01 ). Conclusions: In refractory/relapsed AA, the signal pathway of mTOR/S6 was activated, and it was quiescent in normal controls and newly diagnosed patients with SAA. The expression of p-mTOR, p-S6 and IFN-\u03b3 of this signal pathway in refractory/relapsed AA could be suppressed by RAPA or CTLA-4Ig. The signal pathway of CD28/mTOR/S6/IFN-\u03b3 might take part in immune pathogenesis of refractory/relapsed AA, and was sensitive to RAPA and CTLA-4Ig. It was worth exploring the clinical values of the two drugs.",
