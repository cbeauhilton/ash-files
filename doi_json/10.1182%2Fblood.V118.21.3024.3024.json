    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3024 FN2 Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has become a reasonable treatment option for patients with multiple myeloma who are refractory or have relapse to an autograft. However, in comparison to standard myeloablative conditioning RIC resulted in higher risk of relapse. Maintenance therapy after autologous transplantation has shown to improve survival while after allogeneic SCT data are lacking so far. We here report the results of myeloablative toxicity-reduced allograft consisting of intravenous busulfan (12.2 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) followed by lenalidomide maintenance in 33 patients with multiple myeloma who relapsed to an autograft. A total of 32 patients had received one (n=16), two (n=15), or even three (n=1) autografts, and 1 patient was refractory to 2 induction therapies and failed to collect autologous stem cells. The median duration of remission after the autograft was 12 months. The primary endpoint of the study was non-relapse mortality at 1 year and secondary objectives were evaluation of response, incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease as well as progression and overall survival. To prevent graft-versus-host disease antithymocyte globulin (ATG Fresenius\u00ae) was given at a median dose of 20 mg/kg on day -3, -2, and -1. Lenalidomide was started earliest at day 120 after transplantation if there were no signs of infection or graft-versus-host disease. The median time between last autograft and allogeneic transplantation was 20 months. 19 patients were treated with fully HLA-matched unrelated donor, 8 patients had a mismatch donor, and 6 patients were transplanted from an HLA-identical sibling. 2 patients died of treatment-related complications resulting in a cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality at 1 year of 6% (95% CI: 0\u201314%). After transplantation 27% developed grade II graft-versus-host disease, and severe grade III graft-versus-host disease was seen in 6% of the patients. Complete remission was noted in 46% of the patients, partial remission was seen in 48% and stable disease in 3%. The median interval between allogeneic transplant and start of lenalidomide was 168 days. The median starting dose was 5 mg (range 5\u201315 mg) without dexamethasone for 21 day followed by 1 week rest. 9 patients did not receive lenalidomide maintenance due to ongoing graft-versus-host disease, cytopenia or patient's wish. The median number of lenalidomide cycles was 6 (range 1\u201330). During follow-up 13 patients discontinued lenalidomide treatment due to progressive disease (n=6), GvHD (n=3), thrombocytopenia (n=2), or fatigue (n=2). In 10 patients lenalidomide dose could be increased to 10 or 15 mg, respectively. The major toxicities of lenalidomide were acute graft-versus-host disease grade I \u2013 III (21%), viral reactivation (12%), thrombocytopenia grade III-IV (12%), neutropenia grade III-IV (6%), peripheral neuropathy grade I-II (12%), or other infectious complications (6%). During follow-up 9 patients experienced relapse resulting in a cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years of 42% (95% CI: 18\u201366%). The 3 year estimated probability of progression-free and overall survival was 52 % (95% CI: 28\u201376%) and 79 % (95% CI: 63\u201395%), respectively. In the current trial neither the deletion 13q14 nor the use of mismatch donor nor the chemosensitivity prior allogeneic SCT could be identified as risk factor for survival. This study showed that toxicity-reduced myeloablative conditioning regimen is feasible and highly effective in relapsed patients with multiple myeloma resulting in an acceptable treatment-related mortality. Lenalidomide as maintenance therapy is feasible early after transplantation but toxicity especially the induction of graft-versus-host disease should be considered.
