    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4510 Oxidative stress caused by ionizing radiation is a major determinant of radiation injuries. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (ECSOD), a potent antioxidant enzyme, alleviates oxidative stress. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a subset of adult stem cells from bone marrow, have been found to migrate to radiation injured tissues after intravenous administration. Here, we show for the first time that intravenous administration of MSCs genetically modified to secrete ECSOD improves survival, extends lifespan, retards cataract formation, and prevents carcinogenesis in irradiated mice. These findings suggest that intravenous administration of MSCs overexpressing ECSOD could become a critical medical countermeasure against radiation.
