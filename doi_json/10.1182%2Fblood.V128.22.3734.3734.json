    "abstract_text": "The immune response to platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin complexes is a frequent iatrogenic complication of heparin therapy associated with development of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Our recent studies indicate that PF4/heparin complexes potently activate complement (C') in healthy donors and patients receiving heparin therapy. In these studies, we also show that C' mediates selective antigen-binding to circulating B cells via the complement receptor 2, CD21 (Khandelwal, Blood 2016). In the course of performing these studies, we developed a simple enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based technique for measuring C3 subunit generation by protein/heparin complexes in plasma. For this assay, monoclonal antibodies to PF4/heparin (KKO; Arepally, Blood 2000) or protamine (PRT)/heparin complexes (ADA, Lee unpublished data) are incubated overnight on a microtiter plate, followed by washing and blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 2 hours. To examine C' activation, plasma is incubated with buffer or antigen (PF4, 25\u00b5g/mL \u00b1 heparin or PRT 31 \u00b5g/mL \u00b1 4U/ml heparin) for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C followed by addition of 10mM EDTA to inhibit further C'activation. Plasma containing antigen and activated C' fragments is next added to the antibody coated plate for 1 hour at 4 0 C followed by three washes. C' activation is detected using a biotinylated antibody to C3c (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA) followed by streptavidin-HRP (BD Bio Sciences San Jose, CA). Using this assay, we show that plasma incubated with PF4/heparin complexes, but not PF4 alone or heparin alone trigger C' activation as measured by C3 binding (1:50 plasma dilution shown; Figure 1A). Similarly, using ADA, a recently developed monoclonal antibody to PRT/heparin complexes, we show that PRT/heparin complexes, but not PRT alone or heparin alone, robustly activate C' (1:10 plasma dilution shown; Figure 1B). To show that C3 generation is dependent on ultra-large complex (ULC) formation, we performed experiments using a fixed dose of UFH (0. 5 U/mL) and varying doses of PF4 (5-200 \u00b5g/mL) or fixed dose of PF4 (25 \u00b5g/mL) and varying doses of UFH (0.0005-5.0 U/mL), LMWH (0.01-100 \u00b5g/mL) and fondaparinux (0.05-100\u00b5g/mL). Consistent with published observations (Khandelwal, Blood 2016), we note that changes in PF4 concentration (Figure 2A) or UFH/LMWH/fondaparinux concentration (Figure 2B) results in a bell-shaped curve of C'activation that mirrors ULC formation. Because the immune response to PF4/heparin is highly variable among heparin-exposed patients, we examined inter-individual variation in C' activation by PF4/heparin complexes. For these studies, we analyzed C' activation using a fixed dose of PF4/heparin (25 \u00b5g/mL PF4 and 0.25U/mL heparin) in freshly collected plasma from 10 healthy donors . As shown in Figure 3, we noted that C' activation is highly variable among donors, with some donors showing significant C' activation (donors A,B,C, E ,G,I), while others show minimal C3 generation (donors D,F,H,J) in response to same dose of PF4/heparin complexes. Together, these studies show that the ELISA-based C3 generation assay is a simple, robust assay for detecting C' activation by PF4/heparin or PRT/heparin complexes and can be useful in studying mechanisms of C' activation and biologic effects of commercial heparins.
