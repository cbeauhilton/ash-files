    "abstract_text": "Isoform-selective enzyme targeting poses a potential clinical challenge when there is significant homology in the protein activity domains. Glycogen synthase kinase 3-alpha (GSK3\u03b1) has been identified previously as a therapeutic target to promote differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Banerji et al, JCI, 2012). The GSK3 family consists of two highly homologous, but functionally non-redundant, isoforms (\u03b1 and \u03b2). These proteins are serine-threonine kinases implicated in a diversity of cellular processes. Concurrent inhibition of both isoforms is known to induce \u03b2-catenin stabilization and can therefore increase self-renewal of leukemia initiating cells. Isoform-selective GSK3 suppression does not increase \u03b2-catenin levels (Doble et al, Dev Cell, 2007) and thus may offer a new therapeutic approach. GSK3\u03b1 selective inhibitors, with cell-based activity, have not been reported. Our collaborative study aimed to identify first-in-class GSK3\u03b1 selective inhibitors and evaluate their activity in AML, a disease in great need for new therapeutic approaches. A series of potent and selective inhibitors for GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 were discovered through a screening campaign supported by the NIH's Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network (MLPCN) program. While these compounds are equipotent for GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2, they demonstrate remarkable selectivity versus the larger kinome (> 100x selective vs 311 kinases). Analysis of the high resolution x-ray crystal structure obtained with BRD9421, one of the lead compounds, and GSK3\u03b2 revealed a tridentate hydrogen bond binding mode within the ATP catalytic domain. One of these interactions, is to aspartic 133 in GSK3\u03b2. This same residue in GSK3\u03b1 is a glutamic acid and represents one of the two amino acid differences within the ATP binding domain between these two enzymes. GSK3\u03b1 and \u03b2 share 98% homology in their catalytic domains, but the exploitation of this hydrogen bond interaction through rational drug design offered an excellent opportunity to produce selective inhibitors for GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2. BRD0705 was thus identified as an 8-fold GSK3\u03b1 isoform-selective inhibitor over GSK3\u03b2 (IC50 GSK3\u03b1: 0.045 vs. GSK3\u03b2: 0.350 \u03bcM). We first validated BRD0705 isoform-selectivity in a panel of AML cell lines and primary patients (n=3 cell lines and n= 2 patient samples). Treatment with BRD0705 resulted in a dose- and time-dependent decrease in tyr279 GSK3\u03b1 phosphorylation without any effect on tyr216 GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation. No increase in \u03b2-catenin protein levels by western blotting and no nuclear localization by immunofluorescence were observed. GSK3\u03b1 inhibition with BRD0705 led to morphological and surface marker changes (CD11b, CD11c, CD14, CD117) consistent with AML differentiation in a panel of AML cell lines (n=4) and primary AML samples (n=5). BRD0705 also induced a G2/M arrest and impaired methylcellulose colony formation in AML cell lines and primary patient samples. BRD0705 possesses favorable pharmacokinetic properties and was well tolerated without any observed adverse events in C57BL/6 mice with repeated dosing. In vivo efficacy studies in AML models are ongoing. In conclusion, we identified a first-in-class GSK3\u03b1 isoform-selective inhibitor and conducted preclinical studies validating BRD0705 as a promising new differentiation therapeutic candidate in AML. Small-molecule inhibition of GSK3\u03b1 induced myeloid differentiation, cell cycle arrest and impaired colony formation without \u03b2-catenin stabilization in AML.
