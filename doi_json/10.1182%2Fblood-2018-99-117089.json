    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Patients with relapsed and/or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), especially those with aggressive lymphomas, have overall poor prognosis. Novel targets and therapies are under investigation. Molibresib (GSK525762) is a potent and specific inhibitor of the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) family of proteins, the inhibition of which prevents transcriptional complex assembly and the subsequent expression of oncogenic drivers. Molibresib inhibits growth in NHL cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo . Study BET116183 was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of molibresib in relapsed and refractory hematologic malignancies. Here we report the results from the NHL dose escalation cohort. METHODS: Eligible subjects were adults with relapsed or refractory NHL. An accelerated dose titration was employed with one subject per dose level until the occurrence of a \u2265Grade 2 drug-related toxicity; thereafter, subjects were enrolled in a standard 3+3 design. A Neuenschwander continual reassessment method (N-CRM) model was used to provide guidance for the next dose level. Dose escalation continued until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was identified. All data, including safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy, were used to identify the recommended part 2 dose (RP2D). RESULTS: From 14 May 2014 to the data cutoff date of 24 June 2018, 27 NHL subjects were enrolled and received at least one dose of study drug. Of these, 19 (70%) had B-cell lymphomas (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL], mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, follicular lymphoma , and Burkitt's lymphoma); eight subjects (30%) had T-cell lymphomas (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [CTCL], anaplastic T-cell lymphoma [ATCL], peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma). The median age was 64 years (range 24 to 76); 20 subjects (76%) were male and 7 subjects (24%) were female. The median number of prior treatments was 3 (range 1 to > 4). From the starting dose of 10 mg molibresib orally once daily (QD), the dose was escalated to 80 mg QD. The median time on study was 1.4 months (range 0.2 to 20 months). Two dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were identified in subjects treated at 60 mg QD, though one was subsequently determined not to be a DLT. One subject experienced Grade 4 thrombocytopenia related to study drug. A second subject experienced a Grade 2 mechanical fall; this event was later revised to unrelated to study drug. Across all dose levels, all subjects experienced an adverse event (AE); 25 subjects (93%) experienced at least one AE that was deemed to be related to molibresib treatment. The most common related AEs across all dose levels were thrombocytopenia (n = 21 [78%]), fatigue (n = 6 [22%]), nausea (n = 6 [22%]), diarrhea (n = 4 [15%]), and rash (n = 4 [15%]). Blood bilirubin was increased in 3 subjects (11%), and prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were prolonged in 2 subjects each (7%). Common Grade 3 and Grade 4 related events included thrombocytopenia (n = 19 [70%]), as well as anemia, asthenia, and increased blood bilirubin (n = 2 [7%] each). No Grade 5 related AEs were reported. Among all subjects, 11 (41%) required dose reduction for toxicity: 7 subjects at the 60 mg dose level (39% treated at that dose) and 4 at the 80 mg dose level (57% treated at that dose). PK analyses showed dose-proportionality after single and repeat dosing, with large variability between subjects. One subject with DLBCL achieved a complete remission that was durable through week 54 on study. Four additional subjects (one DLBCL and 3 CTCL) achieved partial remission, for an objective response rate (ORR) of 5/27 (18.5%). Five more subjects had stable disease as best response. Of six CTCL/ATCL subjects enrolled, three subjects had partial response for an ORR of 50% in this sub-population. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the BET inhibitor molibresib in NHL subjects. Overall, thrombocytopenia and other AEs were monitorable, manageable and reversible. The RP2D was identified as 60 mg QD. Single-agent activity was observed across multiple NHL subtypes at both 60 mg and 80 mg doses; most notable was a 50% response rate in subjects with CTCL. Because of the promising data, Part 2 of the BET116183 study is currently open and enrolling subjects with CTCL to better define the clinical activity of BET bromodomain inhibition in this histology.
