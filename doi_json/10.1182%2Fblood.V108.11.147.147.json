    "abstract_text": "Introduction: In a recent French FRALLE versus LALA comparison, we have demonstrated a large benefit in outcome when adolescents and young adults were treated in a pediatric rather than an adult ALL protocol ( Boissel JCO 2003 ). Similar provocative results have been observed in three other pediatric versus adult ALL studies ( Stock ASH 2000, de Bont Leukemia 2004, Testi ASH 2004 ). One explanation may be the larger amounts of steroids, vincristine (VCR), and L-asparaginase (L-aspa) administered in pediatric patients. The GRAALL-2003 study was thus designed to offer a pediatric approach in adults with Ph-negative ALL until 60 years of age. Methods: Treatment included a 5-drug induction, high dose-intensity consolidation blocks, delayed intensification, and 2-year maintenance. The comparison with the former LALA-94 protocol showed a 8.6-fold, 3.7-fold, and 16-fold increase in cumulative doses of prednisone, VCR, and L-aspa, respectively. One difference with childhood ALL therapy remained indication of allogeneic SCT in first CR which was offered to all patients with high-risk factor and a donor. In addition, induction was reinforced with a hyper-cyclophosphamide sequence (HyperC) in case of poor early response (cortico- and/or chemoresistant ALL). In the present report, 212 GRAALL-2003 patients with Philadelphia-negative ALL aged 15\u201355 years with a median follow-up of 18 months were compared to 712 patients previously treated in the LALA-94 trial. Results: Cohorts were comparable in terms of prognostic factors. CR rate was significantly higher in GRAALL patients (93 vs 88%, P=0.02) due to a reduction in resistant disease (0.5 vs 8%, P<0.001) with comparable induction death (6 vs 5%, P=0.37) rate. When compared to the LALA-94 study, 2-year EFS and overall survival were markedly improved (56 vs 41% and 66 vs 54%; P=0.0002 and 0.02, respectively). Similar differences were observed after censoring SCT patients at transplant time, underlining the role played by chemotherapy modification. Because of a worse tolerance to induction and post-remission therapy, the benefit associated with the GRAALL approach decreased with advanced age, becoming not statistically significant over 40 years of age. Finally, outcome improvement was higher in T- than in B-lineage ALL (2-year overall survival, 75 vs 51% and 61 vs 56%; P=0.016 and 0.25, respectively). Among patients with T-ALL, poor early responders (allocated to HyperC induction) tended to have a better EFS than good early responders, suggesting a major role of HyperC in this ALL subset. Conclusion: In conclusion, a pediatric approach benefits to younger adults with ALL."
