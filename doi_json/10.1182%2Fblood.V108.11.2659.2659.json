    "abstract_text": "Background: The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a spectrum of stem cell malignancies with natural histories that vary from indolent mild cytopenias to rapid transformation to acute leukemia. MDS patients have impaired T cell antigen-induced proliferation and reduced T helper-1 (Th-1) cytokine production. Lenalidomide, an immuno-modulatory drug structurally-related to thalidomide, is FDA-approved for the treatment of MDS with chromosome 5q deletion; however, its mechanism of action is not fully characterized. We hypothesize that immune modulation by lenalidomide will be an effective adjunct to vaccine therapy for patients with MDS. Methods: The immunoregulatory effects of lenalidomide were investigated both in vitro and in vivo . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from MDS patients and normal controls were stimulated with anti-CD3 cross-linking, allogeneic dendritic cells (allo-DCs), autologous dendritic cells (auto-DCs), and patient-derived autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) as antigen sources in the presence of DMSO (vehicle control) and lenalidomide [0.625 \u03bcM to 40 \u03bcM]. Proliferation of specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations was assessed by Brdu incorporation and intracellular cytokine production by flow cytometry. Preliminary studies were performed to examine the combined effects of the GMCSF/K562 \u201cbystander\u201d vaccine (gift of Dr. I. Borrello, Johns Hopkins University) and lenalidomide on antigen-induced T cell proliferation in PBMC from both normal donors and MDS patients. Results: Lenalidomide augmented a Th-1-biased cytokine (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2) response from normal donors (n=5) and MDS patients (n=5). The Th-1-biased increase in cytokine production accompanied erythroid response in MDS patients treated with 10 mg of lenalidomide for 16 weeks (n=4 responders and 3 non-responders) ( List et al, NEJM  2005 ; 351 : 549 ). Augmentation of antigen-dependent proliferation accompanied cytokine responses both in vitro and in vivo . Next, we examined the effects of lenalidomide on in vitro response to autologous and allogeneic antigens. We found that pre-treatment T cell proliferation in response to auto-DC priming was not distinguishable from background. However, proliferation in response to auto-BM-MNCs used as a source of autologous tumor antigens was significantly increased by lenalidomide in CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell populations ( P =0.002, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively). Proliferation after allo-DC exposure was also significantly enhanced by lenalidomide treatment (P<0.05). GMCSF/K562 \u201cbystander\u201d vaccine-increased proliferation to allo-DC antigens in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells without exposure to lenalidomide (n=4) (167% increase vs. 245% increase, respectively). When allo-DC-stimulated PBMCs were treated with lenalidomide alone, CD4+ and CD8+ proliferation was increased by 47% and 39% respectively. The combination of lenalidomide and the GMCSF/K562 vaccine further enhanced T cell proliferation to allo-DC stimulation (325% and 397% for CD4+ and CD8+ populations, respectively). Conclusion: Lenalidomide significantly augments T cell immune function in MDS, and potentiates immune response to the GMCSF/K562 \u201cbystander\u201d vaccine. We conclude that lenalidomide represents an attractive adjunct to vaccines for clinical investigation in MDS."
