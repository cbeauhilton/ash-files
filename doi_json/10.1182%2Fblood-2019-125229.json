    "abstract_text": "Relapse of leukemia (RL) is the most common cause of treatment failure following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in patients with AML. Historically, patients who suffer RL following alloHCT have had a dismal prognosis. A number of therapeutic options have recently become available for relapsed/refractory AML, including some that are associated with limited toxicity and may be well tolerated in the post-alloHCT setting. These therapies, and advances in supportive care have the potential to prolong survival of recently transplanted patients who suffer RL post post-alloHCT compared to prior cohorts. We hypothesized that patients suffering RL post-alloHCT within the last 5 years will have improved post-relapse survival compared to patients experiencing RL before this period. In order to test this hypothesis, we analyzed 309 patients who underwent a first allo-HCT for AML between Jan 2002 and Dec 2016 at our center and identified 112 patients (36%) who suffered RL post-alloHCT. Data were extracted from our institutional BMT database where they had been prospectively entered. Patient characteristics of those who experienced RL were: median age 53 (19-74); male - 51%; race- white-86%, black 12%, Asian -2%; donor-MRD 33%, MUD 41%, Haplo 26%; graft source - PBSC 86%, BM 11%, CBU 2%, PBSC+BM 1%; regimen intensity - MAC 61%, NST/RIC 39%%; DRI - intermediate 46%, high 50%, v. high 5%; HCT-CI 0-2 (58%), >3 (42%); KPS > 90 (39%) 250 d vs <100 d - HR 0.55, p=0.025 and haplo donor vs MRD for first alloHCT- HR 2.41, p=0.002. The use of DLI or the occurrence of a second alloHCT post-relapse tested as a time-dependent co-variate were not significantly associated with survival in this analysis. These data suggest that survival for AML patients who suffer relapse of malignancy following alloHCT has improved in recent cohorts when compared to historic controls. Approximately one-half and one-third of the patients are now estimated to live 1 and 2 years following relapse and prolonged survival is possible in some cases. The impact of specific interventions that help promote survival following relapse should be further studied View large Download slide View large Download slide  Close modal Disclosures Solh: ADC Therapeutics: Research Funding; Celgene: Speakers Bureau; Amgen: Speakers Bureau.",
