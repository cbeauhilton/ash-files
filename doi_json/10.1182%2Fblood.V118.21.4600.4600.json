    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4600 MicroRNA miR-155 represents a candidate pathogenic factor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and lymphomas (Eis PS, et al. 2005, Fulci V, et al. 2007, Calin GA, et al. 2005, Kluiver J, et al. 2005, Metzler M, et al. 2004, van den Berg A, et al. 2003., Vargova K. et al 2011). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) expression of miR-155 was associated with NFkB pathway (Rai et al., 2008). In addition, increased miR-155 levels were associated with more aggressive (Activated B-cell like) DLBCL (Eis et al. 2005). The targets of up-regulated miR-155 apparently include a key hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1. Down-regulation of PU.1 represents an important and critical step for both myeloid as well as lymphoid tumorigenesis. We herein found the increased levels of miR-155 coupled with downregulation of its target PU.1 are frequent events in B cells of a vast majority of CLL patients (N=169). To advance understanding of miR-155 and PU.1 in lymphoid malignancies we studied lymph node biopsies derived from patients with lymphomas. We show that increased miR-155 levels are also found in DLBCL (N=31, P < 0.0001), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL, N=22, P < 0.0001), follicular lymphoma (FL, N=23, P < 0.001), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL, N=12, P < 0.01), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL, N=11, P < 0.01). The miR-155-overexpressing tumors display downregulation of PU.1. In contrast, peripheral T cell lymphoma (T-NHL, N=6) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, N=7) expressed miR-155 and PU.1 comparably as control lymph nodes. Our data indicate that expression pattern of miR-155 and its target PU.1 represents a hallmark of some but not all lymphoid malignancies. Interestingly, the miR-155/PU1 levels vary substantially within each diagnosis, therefore, our aim is to further analyze the occurrence of this relationship in different prognostic groups and analyze the clinical outcome as well.
