    "abstract_text": "Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are derived from hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells and often share gene expression patterns and specific pathways. Characterization and mechanistic studies of LSCs are critical as they are responsible for the initiation and potential relapse of leukemias, however the overall framework, including epigenetic regulation, is not yet clear. We previously identified microRNA-150 (miR-150) as a critical regulator of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) -associated leukemias by targeting oncogenes. Our additional results suggest that miR-150 can inhibit LSC survival and disease initiating capacity by suppressing more than 30% of \u201cstem cell signature genes,\u201d hence altering multiple cancer pathways and/or stem cell identities. MLL-AF9 cells derived from miR-150 deficient hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells displayed significant proliferating advantage and enhanced leukemic colony formation. Whereas, with ectopic miR-150 expression, the MLL-AF9 associated LSC population (defined as Lin-ckit+sca1- cells) was significantly decreased in culture. This is further confirmed by decreased blast leukemic colony formation in vitro . Furthermore, restoration of miR-150 levels in transformed MLL-AF9 cells, which often display loss of miR-150 expression in AML patients with MLL-fusion protein expressing, completely blocked the myeloid leukemia development in a transplantation mouse model. Gene profiling analysis demonstrated that an increased level of miR-150 expression down regulates 30 of 114 stem cell signature genes by more than 1.5 fold, partially mediated by the suppressive effects of miR-150 on CBL, c-Myb and Egr2 oncogenes. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-150 is a potent MLL-AF9 leukemic inhibitor that may act by suppressing the survival and leukemic initiating potency of MLL-AF9 LSCs.
