    "abstract_text": "Background Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous disease with multiple prognostic indicators of outcomes to conventional treatments; including age, cytogenetic risk, and presence of genomic abnormalities (NPM1, TP53, FLT3 and IDH1/2). Additionally, overexpression of BCL-2 is a predictor for poor response to chemotherapy and can lead to therapeutic resistance in AML (Campos et. al. Blood, 1993). Venetoclax (Ven), an oral selective BCL-2 inhibitor, in combination with hypomethylating agents (HMA) or low dose cytarabine (LDAC), was recently approved for treatment naive patients (pts) with AML who were not fit for standard induction therapy on the basis of two phase 1b/2 studies (DiNardo et.al, Lancet Onclogy, 2018; Wei et.al., J Clin. Oncol., 2019). Here, we present clinical outcome results from the phase 1b/2 study populations in subgroups defined by molecular markers and correlations with BCL-2 family expression. Methods: The data cut-off dates were 31-Aug-2018 (VEN+HMA study M14-358, NCT02203773) and 22-Aug-2018 (VEN+LDAC study M14-387 NCT02287233). Pt responses were assessed according to the IWG criteria for AML (Cheson et.al., J Clin. Oncol.,2003). The presence of AML associated mutations (NPM1, IDH1, IDH2, TP53 and FLT3) were determined centrally in bone marrow aspirates (BMA) at baseline. BCL-2 ( BCL2 ) gene expression was defined centrally by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using the deltaCt (\u0394Ct) method. BCL2 expression normalized to a reference gene (2 -\u0394Ct ) was evaluated for pts with > 50% AML blasts in baseline BMA (median 75%; range 50-99%). The composite complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi) rate, overall survival (OS), time to first response (TTR), and duration of response (DOR), and BCL-2 gene expression were correlated with presence of baseline molecular markers. Results: Data from 209 pts who received Ven 400 mg or 600 mg in combination with either HMA or LDAC are reported here. The median age was 74 years (range: 61-90 years) and 61% (n=127) were male (Table 1). Of the 167 pts with centrally assessed molecular markers, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations were detected in 25.7%, NPM1 mutations in 15.6%, TP53 mutations in 22.2%, and FLT3 mutations in 18.0% pts. Pts may have more than one of these mutations (i.e co-mutations of NPM1 and IDH1or IDH2, NPM1 with FLT3, or NPM1 with TP53) identified in baseline BMA. The CR/CRi rates were 83.7% for pts with IDH1/IDH2 mutations, 84.6% for pts with NPM1 mutations, 59.5% for pts with TP53 mutations, and 53.3% for pts with FLT3 mutations (Table 2). The median OS was not reached (NR) for pts with IDH1, IDH2 or NPM1 mutations, while the median OS for pts with detectable TP53 mutations or FLT3 mutations was 8.9 mos and 12.4 mos respectively. The remissions (CR or CRi) were rapid (median TTR between 1.1 mos to 1.8 mos) for each group (Table 2) and durable responses were observed for pts with IDH1, IDH2, NPM1, or FLT3 mutations (median DOR was either NR for IDH and NPM1 and 19.9 mos for FLT3). Pts with TP53 mutations are known to have poor prognosis and the DOR in this cohort was 5.6 mos. The median time on study was 11.6 mos (range: 0.3-44 mos). The range of BCL2 mRNA expression (2 -\u0394Ct ) in bone marrow blasts was 0.03 to 2.93, with a median of 0.86. The Cox hazard ratio for OS was 1.06, p=0.8565 based on BCL2 above the median (> 0.86 2 -\u0394Ct ). The multivariate analysis included age, cytogenetic risk, AML type (primary vs secondary) and trial (M14-387 vs M14-358). Albeit not statistically significant and small sample sets, pts with either IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (N = 21) tended to have higher BCL2 expression (median 2 -\u0394Ct 1.1 ; range 0.19 -2.93) while pts with TP53 mutations (N = 7) had lower levels of BCL2 expression (median 2 -\u0394Ct 0.55; range 0.03 - 1.27). Determination of baseline expression of other family members ( BCL2L1, MCL1, BCL2A1, BCLw, NOXA , etc) is ongoing and additional univariate and multivariate analyses will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: These analyses demonstrate that VEN + HMA or LDAC has efficacy across multiple molecular markers in AML. This activity is rapid and durable, and is observed across different levels of BCL2 expression in AML blasts.
