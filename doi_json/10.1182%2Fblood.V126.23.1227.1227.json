    "abstract_text": "Background Formative research suggests that a human embryonic stem cell-specific alternative splicing gene regulatory network, which is repressed by Muscleblind-like (MBNL) RNA binding proteins, is involved in cell reprogramming. However, its role in malignant reprogramming of progenitors into self-renewing leukemia stem cells (LSCs) had not been established. Methods Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on FACS purified progenitors from normal, chronic phase and blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia samples and analyzed using Cuff-links, GSEA and IPA software. Splice isoform specific qRT-PCR, confocal microscopy, lentiviral overexpression and shRNA knockdown experiments were performed according to published methods ( Jamieson NEJM 2004; Geron et al Cancer Cell 2008; Go ff et al Cell Stem Cell 2013 ). Results We performed LSC RNA-seq, lentiviral overexpression and knockdown and discovered that decreased expression of MBNL3, a repressor of an embryonic alternative splicing program and reprogramming, activated a pluripotency network and increased expression of a pro-survival isoform of CD44v3, which is more commonly expressed in human embryonic stem cells. This resulted in malignant reprogramming of progenitors in blast crisis CML endowing them with unbridled survival and self-renewal capacity. This is the first description of MBNL3 downregulation as a mechanism of reversion to an embryonic alternative splicing program, which elicits malignant progenitor reprogramming of progenitors into self-renewing leukemia stem cells. While isoform specific lentiviral CD44v3 overexpression enhanced chronic phase CML progenitor replating capacity, lentiviral shRNA knockdown abrogated these effects. In keeping with activation of a stem cell reprogramming network, CD44v3 upregulation was associated with increased expression of pluripotency transcription factors, including OCT4, SOX2 and b-catenin in addition to the pro-survival long isoforms of MCL1 and BCLX resulting in increased self-renewal and apoptosis resistance. Conclusion In summary, MBNL3 downregulation activates an embryonic alternative splicing program, typified by CD44v3 overexpression, and represents a novel mechanism governing LSC generation in malignant microenvironments. Reversal of malignant reprogramming by epigenetic modulation of embryonic alternative splicing or via monoclonal antibody targeting of CD44v3 splice isoform may represent a pivotal opportunity for selective BC LSC eradication.
