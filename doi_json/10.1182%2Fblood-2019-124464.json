Small, single institution studies suggest that the risk of VTE in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients is elevated and is similar to that seen in solid tumor patients. However, population-based studies describing VTE risk and predictors of VTE in elderly AML patients are lacking. We used Medicare-linked SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) data to address this knowledge gap. METHODS: We identified 4,166 Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with AML at age \u226567y between 2007 and 2013. We ascertained baseline sociodemographics and pre-existing comorbidities for 2y prior to AML diagnosis. Patients were followed from AML diagnosis until development of post-AML VTE, or, in the absence of VTE diagnosis, for 2y (if alive), or until death, blood or marrow transplant, or end of study (12/31/2014), whichever came first. VTE diagnosis was based on ICD 9 codes using validated claims algorithms, and included deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) and thrombophlebitis. Statistical Analysis: Cumulative incidence functions were used to assess post-AML VTE risk (overall, new-onset). Cox regression models examined the following risk factors associated with VTE: age at AML diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, history of pre-AML VTE, and pre-existing co-morbid conditions (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, anemia and peripheral vascular disease). RESULTS: Median age at AML diagnosis was 79y (range: 67-105y); 52% were male, 83% non-Hispanic white and 20% resided in an area where >20% of the population lived below poverty level; 50% of the cohort received chemotherapy. Prior to AML diagnosis, 15% were receiving anticoagulants; 2% were on anticoagulation for pre-AML VTE. Cumulative Incidence of VTE: Overall, 167 (4.0%) patients were diagnosed with post-AML VTE (DVT [63%], PE [32%], thrombophlebitis [5%]); 38% had >1 VTE. Of the 167 patients with post-AML VTE, only 25 (15%) had new-onset VTE; the remaining 142 carried a history of pre-AML VTE. The 2y cumulative incidence of any post-AML VTE was 4.3% (95%CI: 3.6%-5.1%) (Fig 1). Fifty-six percent of VTE episodes occurred within 3 months of AML diagnosis. The incidence was 0.6% (95% CI: 0.5%-0.8%) for new-onset VTE and was 1.9% (95%CI 1.3-2.6) for multiple VTEs. The 2y cumulative incidence of post-AML VTE among those with a history of pre-AML VTE was 17.1% (95% CI: 13.3-21.9%). Risk factors for VTE: Adjusting for age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity, census-tract poverty, and co-morbid conditions, AML patients who had pre-AML VTE, were at 7.6-fold increased risk of post-AML VTE (95%CI: 4.8-12.0, p<0.001). No other risk factors were associated with post-AML VTE risk, with the exception of a marginal association between a prior history of peripheral vascular disease and new-onset VTE (HR=3.5, 95%CI: 0.9-14.8, p=0.08) (Table 1). Risk factors for VTE among patients receiving chemotherapy: Adjusting for age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity, census-tract poverty and co-morbid conditions, AML patients with pre-AML VTE were at 8.1-fold increased risk of any post-AML VTE (95%CI: 4.4-14.7, p<0.001). Mortality associated with VTE: The 2y cumulative incidence of mortality for those with no pre-AML VTE was 91%, compared to 95% for those with a pre-AML VTE (HR 1.23, p=0.017). New-onset VTE after the diagnosis of AML was not associated with an increased risk in mortality (HR 1.04, p=0.705). CONCLUSION: History of VTE prior to diagnosis of AML significantly increases the risk of post-AML VTE and overall mortality. These findings can be used to inform appropriate thromboprophylaxis in elderly AML patients who carry a pre-AML diagnosis of VTE.
