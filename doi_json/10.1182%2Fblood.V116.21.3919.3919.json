    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3919 Background: The constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis and proliferation of Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL). Although somatic activating point mutations in the JAK2 gene have been reported in myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), they are rarely described in HL, where JAK2 amplification is associated with mutations of regulator genes such as SOCS-1, constitutive activation of STAT proteins or miRNA deregulation. Recently, many JAK2 inhibitors, including Lestaurtinib (CEP701), have been reported to have clinical efficacy in MPD. CEP701 is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits FLT3 at nanomolar concentrations. Recent studies in MPD have further shown that CEP701 inhibitory activity is not limited to FLT3 and can suppress JAK2/STAT5 signaling through JAK2 inhibition. As a first step towards elucidating the potential role of CEP701 in HL therapy, we have analyzed its efficacy in vitro . Methods: Four HL cell lines, L-428, L-1236, HDMYZ and L-540, were assayed for proliferation, apoptosis and levels of proteins in the JAK2/STAT pathway (pJAK2, JAK2, pSTAT5, STAT5, Bcl-xL) after CEP701 treatment. 100,000 cells were plated in a 96-well plate in 100 ml culture medium with CEP701 or DMSO (vehicle control) at concentrations of 30\u2013300 nM. After 1 or 24 hours of incubation with CEP701, the levels of the proteins and of FLT3 were analyzed by Western blot. Proliferation was analyzed with CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) and apoptosis by CaspaseGlo 3/7 after 48 hours of treatment. Results: The proliferation analysis showed an effective dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth in the 4 HL cell lines after treatment with increasing concentrations of CEP701. At 48h, in comparison to cells treated with DMSO alone (normalized to 100%), in cells treated with 100nM of CEP701, we observed a marked inhibition of 35% in L-428, 55% in L-1236, 15% in HDMYZ and 77% in L-540. Moreover, apoptosis increased by 38%, 31%, 21% and 25%, respectively. The protein analysis showed that after one hour, CEP701 inhibited phosphorylation of JAK2 (pJAK2) and its downstream target STAT5 (pSTAT5) in a dose-dependent manner, with no changes in the non-phosphorylated proteins. The downstream target Bcl-xL also decreased. Conclusions: Taken together, these data demonstrate that growth inhibition and apoptosis activation by CEP701 in HL cells correlates with the inhibition of the JAK2/STAT5-dependent signal transduction pathway. Here we present the first biological evidence that Lestaurtinib could be a promising new agent in the treatment of patients with HL. Supported by a FIS grant (PS09/00547).
