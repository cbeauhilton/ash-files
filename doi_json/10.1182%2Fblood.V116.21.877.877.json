    "abstract_text": "Abstract 877 Background: Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA), a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, is characterized mainly by erythroid hypoplasia but is also associated with congenital anomalies, short stature and cancer predisposition. DBA has been shown to result from haploinsufficiency of ribosomal proteins (RPS17, RPS19, RPS24, RPL5, RPL11, RPL35a), which renders erythroid precursors highly sensitive to death by apoptosis. The ontogeny and basis of the hematopoietic defect are unclear. The typical presentation of anemia occurs at 2\u20133 months of age, although there are rare cases of hydrops fetalis. Marked phenotypic variations exist among members of the same family and also between subsets of patients with different mutations. Methods: We studied in vitro hematopoietic differentiation of two murine embryonic stem (ES) cell lines: YHC074, Rps19 mutant with the pGT0Lxf gene trap vector inserted in intron 3 of Rps19 , and D050B12, Rpl5 mutant with the FlipRosa\u03b2geo gene trap vector inserted in intron 3 of Rpl5 . Wild-type parental cell lines were used as controls. For primary differentiation and generation of embryoid bodies (EBs), ES cells were cultured in serum-supplemented methylcellulose medium containing stem cell factor (SCF). After 7 days, the cultures were fed with medium containing SCF, interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6 and erythropoietin (epo). EBs were scored on day 6 for total quantity, then again on day 12 for hematopoietic percentage. For secondary differentiation into definitive hematopoietic colonies, day 10 EBs were disrupted, and individual cells were suspended in serum-supplemented methylcellulose medium containing SCF, IL-3, Il-6 and epo. Definitive hematopoietic colonies were counted on day 10. Primitive erythropoiesis differentiation assays were performed by disruption of day 4 EBs, followed by suspension of cells in methylcellulose medium containing plasma-derived serum and epo. Primitive erythropoiesis colonies were counted on day 7. Results: We confirmed haploinsufficient expression (\u223c50% wild type) of Rps19 in YHC074 and Rpl5 protein in D050B12 by Western blot analysis. By polysome analysis, we found a selective reduction in the 40S subunit peak in the Rps19 mutant cell line and in the 60S subunit peak in the Rpl5 mutant cell line. Both types of mutants produced a significantly decreased number of EBs, particularly hematopoietic EBs, compared to parental cell lines. EB size was not compromised in the Rps19 mutant cell line, while Rpl5 mutant ES cells produced significantly smaller EBs, compared to its parental cells. Upon differentiation of cells to definitive hematopoietic colonies, both Rps19 and Rpl5 mutants showed a similar reduction in the erythroid (CFU-E and BFU-E) to myeloid (CFU-GM) colony formation ratio. Primitive erythropoiesis was conserved in the Rps19 mutant ( Figure 1 . 1, top panel). By contrast, the Rpl5 mutant demonstrated a severe primitive erythropoiesis defect ( Figure 1 . 1, bottom panel). For confirmation of these results in an isogenic background, we stably transfected YHC074 ES cells with a vector expressing wild-type Rps19 cDNA and the puromycin resistance gene. Several resistant clones expressed Rps19 at the wild-type level. Upon differentiation of a chosen clone, we demonstrated correction of the EB defect and the definitive erythropoiesis defect, suggesting that the hematopoietic differentiation defects seen are directly related to levels of Rps19 protein. We are currently working on correction of the D050B12 ES cells in a similar manner. Conclusion: Murine ES cell lines with Rps19 and Rpl5 mutations exhibit ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency, demonstrate respective ribosome assembly defects, and recapitulate the major DBA hematopoietic differentiation defect. In addition, a unique defect in primitive erythropoiesis in the Rpl5 mutant ES cell line suggests that the Rpl5 mutation in this mouse strain affects early-stage embryogenesis, a finding which may offer insight into the ontogeny of DBA hematopoiesis and may offer an explanation for phenotypic variations seen in patients (such as hydrops fetalis).
