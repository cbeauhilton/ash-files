    "abstract_text": "Background: Recent studies revealed that Nucleophosmin1 mutated ( NPM1 mut ) based minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring allows identification of patients (pts) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at high risk of relapse. NPM1 mut MRD monitoring remains of clinical relevance even in the context of concurrent gene mutations, e.g . FLT3 internal tandem duplications ( FLT3- ITD pos ) and DNA methyltransferase 3 ( DNMT3A mut ). However, data are varying with regard to the type of material that was used (bone marrow, BM; peripheral blood, PB) and the clinically relevant time points of MRD assessment. Aims: To confirm our previous results on the clinical relevance of NPM1 mut transcript levels (TL) in an extended cohort of 611 younger AML pts [18 to 60 years (yrs)] harboring NPM1 mut . Methods: All 611 pts were enrolled in one of four AMLSG [AMLHD98A (n=46; NCT00146120); AMLSG 07-04 (n=199; NCT00151242); AMLSG 09-09 (n=256; NCT00893399); AMLSG 16-10 (n=110; NCT01477606)] treatment trials. Treatment comprised two cycles of induction therapy (idarubicin, cytarabine, etoposide) with or without ATRA or gemtuzumab ozogamicin, or 1 cycle of daunorubicin and cytarabine followed by 1 to 4 cycles of high-dose cytarabine (n=363, 59%), autologous (n=19, 3%) or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (n=162, 27%). 67 (11%) pts did not receive or complete post-remission therapy. NPM1 mut TL (ratio of NPM1 mut / ABL1 transcripts x 10 4 ) were determined by RQ-PCR; the sensitivity of the assays was 10 -5 to 10 -6 . Median follow-up (FU) for all patients: 3.2 yrs. Results: A total of 3527 BM and 2812 PB samples from 611 NPM1 mut pts were analyzed at diagnosis [n=532 (BM); n=385 (PB)], after each treatment cycle [n=1790 (BM); n=1264 (PB)] and during FU [n=1205 (BM); n=1163 (PB)]. Pretreatment NPM1 mut TL in BM and PB were not associated with clinical characteristics or AML-associated gene mutations and had no impact on relapse-free and overall survival (OS). Cox regression analysis using NPM1 mut TL in BM and PB as continuous variable at different time points during therapy was significantly associated with shorter remission duration (RD) and OS. After twotreatment cycles a > 2log reduction of NPM1 mut TL in BM and PB was significantly associated with a superior OS [p<.0001 (BM); p<.0001 (PB)] and a lower cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) [p=.0002 (BM); p=.02 (PB)]. At this time point 63/395 (16%) pts became RQ-PCR negative (RQ-PCR neg ) in the BM. CIR at 4 yrs was 10% for RQ-PCR neg pts versus 40% for RQ-PCR positive (RQ-PCR pos ) pts (p<.0001) and 4-yrs OS was 82% vs 63%, respectively; (p=.01). With regard to PB 129/293 (44%) pts became RQ-PCR neg which was also associated with a lower CIR (17% vs 49%, p<.0001) but not with a difference in OS (p=.07). Multivariable analysis revealed RQ-PCR neg in the BM as an independent factor for better OS (p=.02) and longer RD (p=.001), whereas in PB RQ-PCR neg was only significant for the endpoint RD (p<.0001). In explorative subgroup analyses achievement of RQ-PCR neg in the BM was significantly associated with a lower CIR independent of the FLT3 -ITD (p=.006) and DNMT3A (p=.04) mutation status. Achievement of RQ-PCR neg in BM was significantly superior in the FLT3 -ITD wildtype / DNMT3A wildtype (26%) and the FLT3 -ITD pos / DNMT3A wildtype (25%) genotypes compared to the FLT3 -ITD pos / DNMT3A mut (8%) and FLT3 -ITD w ildtype / DNMT3A mut (8%) genotypes (p <.001). At the end of treatment, 129/284 pts (45%) were RQ-PCR neg in the BM. CIR was 22% for RQ-PCR neg pts versus 48% for RQ-PCR pos pts (p<.0001). Again, this translated into a better OS (73% vs 61%, respectively; p=.01). Multivariable analysis revealed RQ-PCR neg in the BM and PB as an independent factor for better OS [p=.05 (BM); p200 NPM1 mut TL was 88% in each BM and PB with a median time to relapse of only 1.7 and 1.6 months, respectively. Conclusions: In our study NPM1 mut MRD assessment in BM after 2 treatment cycles was highly informative to identify pts at an increased risk of relapse. Attainment of RQ-PCR neg was significantly associated with a lower CIR and a better OS, independent of concurrent FLT3 -ITD and DNMT3A mutation . However,achievement of RQ-PCR neg strongly correlated with FLT3 -ITD pos / DNMT3A mut and FLT3 -ITD w ildtype / DNMT3A mut genotypes. During FU, TL above >200 were highly predictive for relapse in both BM and PB samples.
