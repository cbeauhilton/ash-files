    "abstract_text": "Abstract 167 Background: In the ENESTnd study, nilotinib significantly reduced progression to accelerated phase/blast crisis (AP/BC) and demonstrated superior rates of deep molecular response vs imatinib. Data from ENESTnd demonstrated that significantly more patients achieved early molecular response of both < 10% and < 1% BCR-ABL IS at both 3 and 6 months on nilotinib vs imatinib. Here, we report landmark analyses based on BCR-ABL transcript levels at 3 and 6 months using data with a minimum follow-up of 3 years and also provide data on factors associated with poor early molecular response; data based on longer follow-up of 4 years will be presented. Methods: The nilotinib 300 mg twice daily (BID; n = 282) and imatinib 400 mg once daily (QD; n = 283) arms from ENESTnd were used for this analysis. Patients were grouped based on BCR-ABL transcript levels of \u2264 1%, > 1% to \u2264 10%, and > 10% at 3 months (n = 258 and n = 264 patients with available PCR samples at 3 months in the nilotinib and imatinib arms, respectively) and at 6 months (n = 257 and n = 256 patients with available PCR samples at 6 months in the nilotinib and imatinib arms, respectively). Rates of major molecular response (MMR; \u2264 0.1% BCR-ABL IS ) and molecular response with a 4.5-log reduction in BCR-ABL transcript levels (MR 4.5 , \u2264 0.0032% IS ) as well as rates of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated among patients grouped according to their BCR-ABL transcript levels at 3 and 6 months. Data on selected baseline characteristics and dose intensity were also assessed. Results: Among evaluable patients at 3 months, 9% of patients (n = 24) in the nilotinib arm vs 33% (n = 88) in the imatinib arm had BCR-ABL transcript levels of > 10%; among evaluable patients at 6 months, 3% of patients (n = 7) in the nilotinib arm vs 16% (n = 40) in the imatinib arm had BCR-ABL transcript levels of > 10%. Patients with a BCR-ABL transcript level of > 10% had a lower probability of future MMR or MR 4.5 as well as poorer PFS and OS compared with patients who had BCR-ABL transcript levels \u2264 10% at 3 months (Table). Results were similar based on 6-month landmark analyses. In patients with > 10% BCR-ABL transcript levels at 3 months, the average dose intensity of nilotinib within the first 3 months was 474 mg/day compared with 600 mg/day for patients with \u2264 10% BCR-ABL transcript levels; the average dose intensity of imatinib within the first 3 months was the same (400 mg/day) for patients with both \u2264 10% and > 10% BCR-ABL levels at 3 months (Table). Patients with > 10% BCR-ABL transcript levels at 3 months were also more likely to have high Sokal risk, larger spleen size, and additional chromosomal abnormalities compared with patients with \u2264 10% BCR-ABL transcript levels at 3 months. Other factors associated with early response and further data on long-term outcomes are being assessed and will be presented with a minimum follow-up of 4 years. Conclusions: Fewer patients in the nilotinib arm vs the imatinib arm had BCR-ABL transcript levels > 10% at 3 and 6 months. Reasons for poor early response appeared to be related, at least in part, to baseline factors and dose intensity. Early molecular response at 3 and 6 months correlated with future MMR and MR 4.5 as well as an increased probability of PFS and OS. Nilotinib frontline therapy allows more patients to achieve deeper responses earlier, associated with improved long-term outcomes vs imatinib.  BCR-ABL at 3 months .
