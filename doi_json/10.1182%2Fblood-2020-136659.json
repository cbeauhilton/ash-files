    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Odronextamab (REGN1979) is a first-in-class, hinge-stabilized, fully human IgG4-based CD3 x CD20 bispecific antibody (bsAb) that has demonstrated encouraging safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy in a first-in-human study of patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). We report updated safety and efficacy data from the dose escalation and early dose expansion phase of the ongoing Phase (P)1 study (NCT02290951). METHODS: Odronextamab was administered using a step-up dose schedule consisting of an initial dose at Week (W)1, an intermediate dose at W2, and thereafter, a fixed weekly dose until W12 followed by maintenance Q2W dosing. Dexamethasone premedication was used to mitigate the risk for cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Key primary objectives were to assess safety and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and to establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended P2 dosing regimen (RP2DR). Secondary objectives included a preliminary assessment of anti-tumor activity. RESULTS: As of Jun 25, 2020, 127 pts with R/R B-NHL have been treated at doses ranging from 0.03-320 mg. The study included pts with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; n=71), follicular lymphoma (FL) Grade (Gr) 1-3a (n=37), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; n=11), marginal zone lymphoma (n=6), and other B-NHLs (n=2). Pts were highly refractory (80.3%) and had received a median of 3 (range: 1\u201211) prior lines of therapy; 29 pts (22.8%) received prior CAR T therapy (FL: 2; DLBCL: 25; MCL: 2) and 85 pts (66.9%) were double refractory to alkylator and anti-CD20 antibody, in any line of therapy. Median follow-up was 3.9 (0.4\u201237.6) months (mo). No DLTs were reported during dose escalation and MTD was not reached with odronextamab doses up to 320 mg weekly. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events (AEs) of any grade were pyrexia (76.4%), CRS (62.2%), and chills (48.0%). Gr 3 CRS occurred in 8 pts (6.3%) and a Gr 4 CRS occurred in 1 pt (0.8%). Most of the CRS events occurred during the first 2 weeks of step-up dosing and resolved within a median of 2 days (range 1-41) with supportive care measures. No pts discontinued odronextamab treatment due to CRS. Gr 3 neurologic AEs were noted in 5 pts, of which only 3 (2.3%) were considered treatment-related: somnolence, syncope, and encephalopathy. None of these events required treatment discontinuation. There were no Gr 4 or higher neurologic AEs. Overall, 7 pts (5.5%) discontinued treatment due to treatment-related AEs. In pts with R/R FL Gr 1-3a, odronextamab demonstrated a broad window of therapeutic activity. In pts treated at doses of \u22655 mg (n=28), objective response rate (ORR) was 92.9%, and complete response (CR) rate was 75.0%; median duration of response (DoR) was 7.7 mo (range 0+-20.9+), with 13 of 21 CRs ongoing at last tumor assessment. The median duration of complete response (DoCR) was 8.1 mo (range 0+-19.9+) and follow-up is ongoing ( Table ). In pts with R/R DLBCL, encouraging activity was observed at higher odronextamab dose levels. In DLBCL pts who had not received prior CAR T therapy, treated at doses \u226580 mg (n=10), ORR and CR rate were 60%; median observed DoR was 10.3 mo (range 2.9-18.6+), with 4 of 6 CRs ongoing at last tumor assessment. The median DoCR was 9.5 mo (range 2.9-18.6+) and follow-up is ongoing. In DLBCL pts who were refractory to prior CAR T therapy, treated at doses \u226580 mg (n=21), ORR was 33.3%, and CR rate was 23.8%; median observed DoR was 2.8 mo (range 0+-18.9+), with 5 of 5 CRs ongoing at last tumor assessment. The median DoCR was 4.4 mo (range 0+-18.9+) and follow-up is ongoing. Based on an evaluation of preliminary antitumor activity and PK, RP2DR was identified for dose expansion cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Odronextamab has demonstrated encouraging single agent antitumor activity in highly refractory pts with B-NHLs. Durable CRs have been observed in both indolent and aggressive B-NHL pts, including in pts refractory to CAR T therapy. Most CRs are ongoing at time of data cutoff, and updated data will be presented. Odronextamab has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Dexamethasone premedication and step-up dosing mitigates the risk for CRS and allows odronextamab administration up to 320 mg weekly without DLTs. A global P2 trial investigating odronextamab in R/R B-NHL is ongoing.
