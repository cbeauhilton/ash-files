    "abstract_text": "Ibrutinib (IBR), an inhibitor of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), has been FDA approved for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). However, IBR responses are incomplete in most cases, and of short duration for MCL and higher-risk CLL subtypes. We hypothesize that intrinsic resistance, incomplete responses, and rapid recurrence can be due to adaptive signaling that should be co-targeted with BTK inhibition to achieve deeper and more durable responses. We previously showed that venetoclax (VEN), an inhibitor of Bcl-2, generated synergistic cytotoxicity with IBR in MCL lines as well as circulating leukemic B cells in 13/19 CLL and 4/5 MCL patient samples treated ex vivo (Jayappa KD et al. ASH 2015; Portell CA et al. ASH 2014). However, the sensitivity to VEN or IBR+VEN was highly variable among patient samples, and did not correlate with the diagnostic genetic lesions in the CLL/MCL cells or clinical characteristics of the patients. Here, we show that resistance to IBR+VEN can be induced by interaction with soluble factors found in the in vivo \"macroenvironment\" of the circulating cancer cells. To gain insight into changes in signaling pathways that might underlie mechanisms of drug synergy and resistance, we analyzed drug resistant MCL lines treated with IBR, VEN, and the combination by Reverse Phase Protein Arrays. We observed downregulation of PI3K-Akt, MAPK, JAK-STAT, and NOTCH signaling after IBR and IBR+VEN treatment, cleavage of caspases and PARP after VEN-treatment, and greatly enhanced cleavage of caspases and PARP after IBR+VEN treatment. A notable exception was significantly increased phosphorylation on p65 S536 of the NF-kB pathway at longer times after IBR+VEN treatment, indicating a possible role of NF-kB signalling in generating resistance to IBR and VEN in cells that survived treatment. To determine whether extrinsic factors in the cancer cell environment might be able to induce a drug-resistant phenotype, we co-cultured or pre-incubated PBMC with a diverse panel of stromal cells, cytokines, and other agonists . We found that the combination of soluble CD40L, IL-10, and CpG DNA (agonist mix) generated nearly complete resistance to IBR+VEN in CLL and MCL patient samples, with CpG DNA being the most effective single agent. Every sample treated with agonist mix displayed increased resistance to IBR+VEN drug combination, suggesting that responsiveness transcends genetic heterogeneity and reflects the developmental lineage of the cancer cells. We investigated whether the extrinsic agonists induce drug resistance by activating the NF-\u03baB pathway, by analyzing nuclear localization of NF-kB transcription factors RelA and RelB using ImageStream and cell fractionation. We observed robust activation of alternative-NF-kB signaling in primary CLL and MCL cells treated with agonist mix, with little effect on canonical NF-\u03baB. PKC, MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling also showed evidence of activation by agonist mix. Agonist mix treatment also caused significant overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and survivin, but not Bcl-2. Inhibitors of NF-\u03baB blocked RelB translocation and overexpression of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and survivin. Inhibitors of NF-kB or of upregulated anti-apoptotic proteins overcame drug resistance induced by agonist mix. Inhibitors of the other activated pathways (MAPK, PI3K-Akt, PKC) did not block agonist-induced drug resistance at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. To determine whether extra-nodal agonists in the blood of patients could generate resistance to IBR and VEN, we analyzed drug cytotoxicity in CLL patient PBMCs cultured with autologous plasma. We found that autologous plasma was able to induce increased resistance to IBR+VEN in 3/7 CLL samples and this resistance was blocked by treatment with an NF-kB inhibitor. In conclusion, soluble agonists in the patient macroenvironment of circulating CLL/MCL cells can generate resistance to IBR+VEN by activating alternative-NF-kB signaling and over-expression of multiple anti-apoptotic proteins. Inhibitors of NF-kB or of the upregulated anti-apoptotic proteins overcame IBR+VEN resistance generated by these extrinsic factors. We suggest that survival signals generated by extra-nodal agonists in the patient macroenvironment generate drug resistance in CLL and MCL, and that improved responses could occur with interventions that block these survival signals.
