    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1652 Nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) transcription factors are involved in cancer-relevant processes such as suppression of apoptosis, growth promotion, enhanced migration and invasiveness, although their actual role as oncogenic or tumor-suppressive activities remains controversial. Moreover, NF-\u03baB-mediated suppression of apoptosis has been linked to chemoresistance. Interestingly, cellular senescence, a terminal cell-cycle arrest initiated via DNA-damaging chemotherapy as well, and known to improve long-term outcome, is associated with the massive induction of secretable NF-\u03baB target genes, which, in turn, potentially reinforce the senescence phenotype. In this study, primary E\u03bc- myc transgenic mouse lymphomas as a well established model for human aggressive B-NHL, and information from human diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) were used in a cross-species approach to identify oncogenic networks in which chemotherapy-activated NF-\u03baB signaling no longer mediates resistance but promotes therapy-induced senescence (TIS) and contributes to the outcome of anti-cancer treatment. Primary Myc-driven lymphoma cells, stably bcl2-transduced to block apoptosis, were exposed to the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agent adriamycin (ADR) to induce TIS. Gene set enrichment analysis of microarray-based gene expression profiles from drug-senescent vs. untreated cells found NF-\u03baB target genes strongly skewed towards the TIS group, and multiplex ELISA-based analysis detected significantly higher DNA binding activities for the NF-\u03baB family subunits p50, p52, p65 (RelA) and RelB in senescent cells. Inactivation of NF-\u03baB by stable expression of the NF-\u03baB super-repressor I\u03baB\u03b1-\u03b4N (SR) lowered expression levels of NF-\u03baB target genes in ADR-treated lymphomas. Matched pairs of individual primary lymphomas differing only in their SR status displayed compromised senescence induction in vivo when expressing the SR, indicating that TIS depends on intact NF-\u03baB function. To assess the contribution of endogenous NF-\u03baB signaling to long-term outcome, we grouped primary Myc-lymphomas by their NF-\u03baB activity levels as \u201cNF-\u03baB low\u201d (NL) or \u201cNF-\u03baB high\u201d (NH). ADR-treated NH, but not NL lymphomas presented selective vulnerability to the SR moiety. Recapitulating the clinical outcome of patients suffering from DLBCL, around 60% of the mice harboring E\u03bc- myc lymphomas achieved long-term remissions, while the remaining 40% encountered a relapse after chemotherapy. Relapsing Myc-lymphomas exhibited substantially higher expression of the NF-\u03baB targets I\u03baB\u03b1 and bcl2, reminiscent of activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL, the clinically inferior subtype characterized by constitutively active NF-\u03baB signaling. In contrast, germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL rarely possess activating NF-\u03baB mutations, but frequently develop in the context of a t(14;18) translocation that drives Bcl2 overexpression independent of NF-\u03baB. Induced NF-\u03baB target gene expression and increased TIS induction after overexpression of an NF-\u03baB-activating CARD11 mutant suggested that higher NF-\u03baB activity may contribute to treatment outcome via TIS promotion. Indeed, stratifying a large dataset of untreated GEP and corresponding clinical data after immunochemotherapy from 233 DLBCL patients by a 63-gene NF-\u03baB expression signature (Shaffer-AL et al, Immunol Rev, 2006; Lenz-G et al, N Eng J Med, 2008), confirmed for the subset of GCB patients with above-median Bcl2 expression \u2013 the group whose genetic features we modeled before in the mouse \u2013 a significantly superior progression-free survival. In essence, our \u201ccross-species\u201d investigations demonstrate opposing roles of NF-\u03baB in treatment outcome and have important ramifications for clinical trials that aim at inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling in DLBCL.
