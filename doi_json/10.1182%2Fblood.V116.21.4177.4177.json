    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4177 The BCL11B transcription factor, previously identified as a central player in normal \u03b1/\u03b2 T-cell development, has recently been found to play critical roles in the maintenance of T-cell identity, with biallelic Bcl11b inactivation in T-cell precursors severely impairing their continued development into the T-cell lineage. Previous work has demonstrated that Bcl11b haploinsufficiency accelerates the onset of thymic lymphomas in p53-mutant mice, as well as T-lymphoid blast crisis in a mouse model of chronic myeloid leukemia induced by BCR-ABL. Furthermore, we have recently identified recurrent monoallelic Bcl11b deletions in 91% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) arising in Atm- deficient mice, further supporting a role for Bcl11b haploinsufficiency in T-cell leukemogenesis. In order to determine whether BCL11B inactivation plays a role in the molecular pathogenesis of human T-ALL, we analyzed BCL11B status in primary T-ALL patient samples by array CGH and sequencing analysis. Monoallelic BCL11B deletions were identified in 6% of cases (n = 3 of 47) analyzed by array CGH, including one microdeletion within the BCL11B locus, one small deletion involving BCL11B and 6 additional genes, and one large 26 Mbp deletion of the distal arm of chromosome 14. BCL11B sequencing revealed heterozygous missense mutations in an additional 9% (n = 4 of 43) of primary T-ALL patient samples and in 19% (n = 3 of 16) of T-ALL cell lines. Structural homology modeling revealed that many of the mutations identified, including 3 of the 4 in the primary patient samples, disrupted key amino acids within BCL11B zinc finger domains that are involved in DNA recognition or structural stabilization required for zinc finger domain-mediated transcriptional activity. Analysis of TCR \u03b3 rearrangement status and gene expression data revealed that most cases with BCL11B inactivation were characterized by biallelic TCR \u03b3 rearrangements together with an early thymocyte precursor (ETP) gene expression signature, indicating developmental arrest at a prethymocyte stage of T-cell development, which we and others have shown confers an increased risk of treatment failure (Coustan-Smith et al. Lancet Oncol 2009; Gutierrez et al. J Clin Oncol 2010). Given that BCL11B expression during normal T-cell development increases markedly at the prethymocyte stage, our findings suggest that BCL11B inactivation may be directly responsible for developmental arrest at a prethymocyte stage during thymocyte transformation. Our findings provide compelling evidence that BCL11B is a tumor suppressor in a subset of human T-ALLs with a high risk of treatment failure.
