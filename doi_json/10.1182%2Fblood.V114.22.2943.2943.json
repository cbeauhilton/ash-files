Nonetheless, they show distinct clinical presentations suggesting that they may represent two different biological entities. In order to gain insights into the biological characteristics of these T-cell malignancies we applied genomic and transcriptomic approaches on residual diagnostic specimens from pediatric patients affected by T-ALL or T-LBL. Patients and methods: Genome-wide gene expression profiling (HG-U133Plus2.0, Affymetrix) was performed for 20 patients affected by T-LBL and 10 patients affected by T-ALL. In order to control for normal cells contamination present in the nodal biopsies (T-LBL) and bone marrow aspirates (T-ALL), we used gene expression profiles of B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and common (CD10+) lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively. Results: Genes differentially expressed in nodal versus bone marrow-derived samples were subtracted from the T-LBL versus T-ALL signature allowing the identification of a subset of genes able to discriminate the two T-cell malignancies regardless of their localization. This gene signature includes genes involved in chemotactic response, cell adhesion and angiogenesis which may play a role in the different tumor cell localization. Indeed, genes involved in promoting angiogenesis, invasion and nodal localization were up-regulated in T-LBL. Copy number analysis was performed using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays (Human Mapping 100K arrays, Affymetrix) on a subset of the samples (9 T-ALL and 9 T-LBL) analyzed by gene expression profiling. This analysis detected approximately 200 genetic loci recurrently affected by copy number alterations in T-ALL and/or T-LBL. The most common aberration was the 9p21.3 deletion which includes CDKN2A/B. Consistent with previous reports amplifications involving MYB were identified in two cases of T-ALL. Although most aberrations were commonly found in both entities several were recurrently detected in T-LBL but not in T-ALL and vice versa. Conclusion: Taken together these results suggest that T-LBL and T-ALL share a large fraction of their biological features; nevertheless each malignancy displays also a unique pattern of genetic lesions and specific gene expression signatures, which may contribute to the understanding of the distinct evolution of these T-cell malignancies.
