    "abstract_text": "Although the genetic processes responsible for gamma-globin gene and protein silencing are not known, the prevailing model is that gamma-globin silencing results from a gradual change within a single hematopoietic cell lineage that is governed by intrinsic properties of the cells. In order to provide a more complete characterization of the silencing phenomenon, we studied globin expression patterns directly from clinical samples using single-cell, quantitative PCR, and globin protein phenotyping. We collected blood samples from untransfused donors: umbilical cords (n=3), infants (n=11; ages 1 day to 35 months), and adults (n=3). All samples were maintained at 4\u00b0C and analyzed within 72 hours. Flow cytometry (30,000 cells per donor) and HPLC analyses were used for globin protein phenotyping. For globin gene expression, we identified reticulocytes using a strategy that required no membrane permeabilization, and sorted them as single cells directly into lysis buffer. Oligo-dT reverse transcription of mRNA was followed by real-time PCR quantitation. Globin cDNA copy numbers were calculated using standard curves from serial dilutions of a plasmid DNA. We analyzed approximately 1000 single-cell quantitative PCR amplifications for gamma- and beta-globin gene expression. In cord blood, we detected both gamma- and beta-globin gene expression in 97.4% (112/115) of the reticulocytes. The average gamma-globin cDNA copy number was 1870\u00b11390 copies, compared with an average beta-globin cDNA copy number of 2181\u00b12138 copies per reticulocyte. HbF and HbA were also detected in >95% of the cord blood erythrocytes. In the adult samples, HbF was detected in <5% of the circulating erythrocytes and gamma-globin gene expression in only 1.5% (3/206) of the reticulocytes. The average gamma-globin cDNA copy number in the minor population of gamma(+) adult reticulocytes was 468\u00b1198 copies, and the average beta-globin cDNA copy number in the beta(+) adult reticulocytes was 3869\u00b13733 copies. Compared with the relatively monotonous patterns of gamma-globin gene and protein expression in cord and adult blood, we clearly detected an age-based fluctuation between those patterns in the infant blood samples. During the first three years of life, a gradual loss in the level of gamma-globin gene and protein expression was identified among the gamma(+)beta(+) reticulocytes and the HbF(+)HbA(+) erythrocytes. In addition, discrete populations of gamma(\u2212)beta(+)reticulocytes and HbF(\u2212)HbA(+) erythrocytes were detected. Rapid expansion of those gamma-silenced populations became apparent soon after birth. Within four months, the proportion of gamma-silenced cells eclipsed that of the gamma(+)beta(+) cells to become the predominant population. By three years after birth, the two cell populations essentially merged to become a single, gamma-silenced population similar to that found in adults. These data suggest two cellular mechanisms for gamma-globin silencing in humans: 1) a gradual loss in gamma-globin expression in the gamma(+)beta(+) cells beginning prior to delivery and continuing during infancy, and 2) replacement of the gamma(+)beta(+) cells with a population of gamma-silenced cells that rapidly accumulate after birth, possibly in response to the dramatic increase in oxygenation or other environmental changes."
