    "abstract_text": "Background Tunneled central venous catheters have traditionally been used for administration of chemotherapy (chemo) for acute leukemia treatment. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are increasingly being used, but there is an increased risk of PICC-associated thrombosis (PAT). There is limited information on management of PAT in this subgroup of patients (pt). Methods In this retrospective cohort study we investigated the primary management of PICC related upper extremity venous thrombosis (TB) in pt with hematologic malignancy undergoing chemo at Mayo Clinic Rochester.\u00a0 Eligible pt were 18 years and older, had documentation of PICC placement at our institution, initiation of chemo within a week of PICC placement, and the TB was objectively documented by compression venous ultrasound (CVU).\u00a0\u00a0 Superficial venous TB (SVT) was defined as TB of subcutaneous veins (basilic and cephalic) and deep venous TB (DVT) defined as TB of brachial, axillary, subclavian, or innominate superior vena cava and internal jugular veins. We retrospectively stratified initial management (IM) into 1) PICC removal alone (PR), 2) PR and therapeutic anticoagulation (AC), 3) AC alone, and 4) conservative management (CM) consisting of symptomatic care and observation.\u00a0 We also investigated factors influencing IM of PAT.\u00a0 Long term outcomes including incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE), post phlebitic syndrome and recurrence of TB were noted. Results Between 2006 and 2012, 190 pt with AML (n=160), MDS or MDS/MF (n=10), or ALL (n=20) met our study criteria.\u00a0 Overall, 40/190 (21.6%) developed PAT: AML n=38, ALL n=1, MDS/MF n=1. SVT occurred in 16/40 (40%) pt and DVT occurred in 24/40 (60%) pt. IM is shown in Table 1. Table 1 Management of PICC-Associated Thrombosis  . PR alone . AC and PR . AC alone . CM .

Of DVT pt on AC (n=14), 5 pt completed at least 2 months of AC.\u00a0 Reasons for early cessation (n=9) of AC included thrombocytopenia (tcp, n=4), hematoma (n=1), hematuria (n=1), subarachnoid hemorrhage (n=1), and unknown (n=1). \u00a0\u00a0One pt died 2 days after presence of DVT was noted. Two pt initially treated with PR alone developed a second TB with placement of a new PICC on contralateral arm and AC was subsequently initiated (duration: 3 months (n=1), and 8 days (n=1)). 14 pt with DVT had f/u CVU within 3 months which demonstrated prog (n=2), stab (n= 8), or R/I ( n=4) of TB (Table 2).

(1-4 days), one pt had PR at discharge (27 days from TB), and one pt had PICC in place on discharge. One pt with DVT experienced a PE within one year f/u.\u00a0 This pt had initially completed 3 days of AC which was stopped because of tcp. Conclusion In this cohort of patients with PAT, the most common IM consisted of PR, which appeared to result in a low recurrence rate among pt with SVT.\u00a0 In pt with DVT, the role of AC remains to be defined given the abbreviated course of AC in most pt.\u00a0 Though, the lack of CVU followup in all pt limits conclusions, there appeared to be a low rate of symptomatic prog.\u00a0 Initiation of AC was largely guided by platelet count and degree of occlusive symptoms. Thrombocytopenia was also the most commonly cited reason for discontinuing AC.\u00a0 Close clinical follow up aided by the use of CVU was integral to ensure that PAT did not lead to further adverse events.
