    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2716 Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common subtype of indolent lymphoma and most patients with FL are diagnosed with advanced stage. \u201cEarly lesion\u201d of FL including partial involvement of FL and FL in situ was proposed recently, of which clinical implication remains uncertain. One report suggested that some patients with FL in situ can develop into clinically overt FL afterward (Blood 2011; 118:2976). However, it is unclear whether clinically overt FL is usually preceded by \u201cearly lesion\u201d. In order to answer this question, we retrospectively reviewed the archived pathological specimen of lymph nodes (LNs) that had been obtained at surgery with LNs dissection for a preceding other malignancy before the diagnosis of FL in patients with clinically overt FL. Materials and Methods Cases for study were diagnosed as FL at Toranomon Hospital between January 2001 and March 2012 and had undergone surgery with LNs dissection for a preceding malignancy. We reexamined the dissected LNs by morphology and immunohistochemistry. The hematoxylin and eosin stained slides were reviewed and immunohistochemical staining was performed using a streptavidin-biotin complex technique. Antibodies included the following: CD5, CD10, CD20, CD21, BCL2, BCL6, MIB1. This study was performed with the approval by the Institutional Review Board. Results Among the 167 patients who were diagnosed as FL at Toranomon Hospital during this period, 8 patients (4.8%) had undergone surgery with LNs dissection for a preceding malignancy (Table). Preceding malignancy was gastric carcinoma (n=3), esophageal carcinoma (n=2), and endometrial carcinoma (n=2), and colon cancer (n=1), respectively. Surgery for preceding malignancy had been performed at a median of 18 months (9\u2013186 months) before the diagnosis of FL. No patient had lesions suggestive of lymphoma on preoperative imaging studies or endoscopic examinations. With immunostaining of the archived specimen, FL was found in all of the 8 cases, of which 6 cases were FL in situ and 2 cases were usual FL. The number of resected LN was median 38 (19\u2013153) and the involvement of FL was detected in 60% of the resected LNs. LNs metastasis of carcinoma was found in 4 cases. Median duration from surgery for precedent malignancy to the diagnosis of overt FL was 26 mo(12\u2013186) in patients preceded by the FL in situ and 13 mo (9,17) in patients preceded by clinically latent but pathologically usual FL. Conclusion We found that FL is preceded by latent FL that is only detectable by pathology. Remarkably, 6 out of 8 cases were preceded by FL in situ. This retrospective series suggests that \u201cearly lesion\u201d of FL is a precursor lesion of clinically overt FL. Table  Case . Age at FL diagnosis . FL involved LNs at FL diagnosis .
