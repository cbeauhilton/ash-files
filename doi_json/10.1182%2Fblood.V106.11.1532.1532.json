    "abstract_text": "Cyclophosphamide (CP) is one of the alkylating agents collectively referred to as oxazaphosphorines that are used to treat many types of cancers including myeloid leukemia. Tumor cell drug resistance is an important factor for clinical treatment failure. The mechanisms of drug resistance are multifactorial and incompletely understood. KBM-7 human CML cell line was established from blast cells from a patient in the terminal phase of CML. In the CP resistance model, the B5-180 sub-line was isolated following exposure to the in vitro active CP analog 4HC. B5-180 cells were cross-resistant to busulfan and \u03b3-radiation. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix Genechip HG-U95Av2 arrays. Each array contains 12,386 probes corresponding to approximately 9000 known human genes. Each cell line was arrayed in triplicate. Quantitative RT-PCR, Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) and cytogenetic analysis were performed in both cell lines. Both the KBM-7/B5 parental line and B5-180 resistant sub-line expressed high-levels of BCR-ABL transcripts by real-time RT-PCR. FISH and cytogenetic analysis revealed multiple copies of t(9;22) translocation and other additional chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 8, and abnormalities of chromosome 18 in both cell lines. Gene array identified 794 gene transcripts that were more than twofold (range from 2-fold to 2675-fold) over-expressed or under-expressed in the resistant line relative to the parental line. ALDH1A1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family) showed the most differential expression between sensitive and resistant cell lines, ALDH1A1 was upregulated more than 2000-fold in the resistant sub-line. ALDH-2 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 family mitochondrial) was also expressed substantially higher in the resistant line. This finding is consistent with the established fact that elevated ALDH activity is an important factor in the resistance of B5-180 cells to 4HC. The remaining differentially expressed genes encode proteins with a wide variety of biochemical functions, which include 44 apoptosis and 7 anti-apoptosis-related genes, 56 genes related to cell cycle and cell growth, 6 DNA repair genes, 13 genes involved in hemopoiesis and B-cell activation. We also tested the expression of the hematopietic transcription factor PU-1 and PUB, a novel PU-1 binding factor. Interestingly, the expression of PU-1 was decreased and PUB increased in the resistant clone. In conclusion, we have identified a large number of differentially expressed genes in a CP resistant cell line derived from CML blast crisis by microarray technology. Our results suggest that CP resistance is a complex phenotype that involves multiple genes and a variety of mechanisms. Real-time RT-PCR analysis and further characterization of selected genes associated with CP resistance as well as the response in vitro to tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently under investigation.",
