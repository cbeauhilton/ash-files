    "abstract_text": "In order to assess the impact of age at first exposure to F VIII and therapy regimen on neutralizing FVIII-antibodies in previously untreated patients (PUP) with hemophilia A a prospective study was performed. Over a 23-years study period a total of 74 severely affected hemophilia A -PUPs have been consecutively recruited, treated with F VIII and investigated for inhibitor development. The patients were divided into two groups according to their treatment regimen: Group 1 (n=23) started prophylaxis at the age of 1 year (before or immediately after the first relevant bleed). Group 2 (n=43) was treated on-demand or prophylaxis was started after more than 2 bleeds. The following parameters were equally distributed among both groups: caucasian ethnicity, intron-22-inversion, age at 1 st ED >0.5 years. Out of 74 hemophilia A patients 23 developed inhibitors (31%). Inhibitor incidence was 0% (1 transient inhibitor out of 23 patients) in those patients who received early prophylaxis (group 1) and 42% (18/43 patients) in case of delayed prophylaxis or on-demand treatment (group 2) (p=0.002). No linear correlation was found between the age at first exposure and inhibitor formation. However, patients treated before the age of 0.5 years showed a significantly higher inhibitor incidence (62%) than those treated at an more advanced age. Our data confirm that very early age at first exposure is a risk factor for inhibitor development in severe hemophilia A patients. Early prophylaxis might be protective against inhibitor development. To confirm the data a larger patient cohort has to be investigated.",
