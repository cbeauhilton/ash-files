    "abstract_text": "Previously, we described new mechanism of G-CSF-triggered granulocytic differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) via activation of the enzyme Nicotinamide Phosphorybosyltransferase (NAMPT) leading to NAD + production and activation of NAD + -dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). We found, that upon stimulation of HSCs with NAMPT, SIRT1 bound to the key myeloid transcription factor C/EBP\u03b1 followed by transcriptional induction of C/EBP\u03b1 target genes G-CSFR and G-CSF and granulocytic differentiation. In the present work we investigated the mechanism of NAMPT/SIRT1-triggered deacetylation of C/EBP\u03b1. We found that C/EBP\u03b1 is acetylated at the position Lys 161, which is evolutionarily conserved. Lys 161 is localized in the transactivation element III (TE-III) of the transactivation domain (TAD) of C/EBP\u03b1 protein, which is responsible for recruitment of SWI/SNF and CDK2/CDK4. Western blot and DUOLINK analysis using rabbit polyclonal antibody specifically recognizing acetyl-Lys 161 of C/EBP\u03b1 revealed predominantly nuclear localization of acetylated C/EBP\u03b1 protein in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and HL60 as well as in primary HSCs. Induction of myeloid differentiation of HSCs by treatment with G-CSF as well as ATRA-induced differentiation of NB4 cells resulted in the deacetylation of C/EBP\u03b1. NAMPT inhibition in NB4 and HL60 cell lines using specific inhibitor FK866 led to the dramatically elevated levels of acetylated C/EBP\u03b1 and reduced amounts of total C/EBP\u03b1 protein, which was in line with diminished mRNA expression of C/EBP\u03b1 target genes (G-CSF, G-CSFR and ELANE). Interestingly, treatment of acute myeloid leukemia cell line HL60 with NAMPT or transduction of HL-60 cells with NAMPT-expressing lentiviral construct induced myeloid differentiation of these cells even without addition of ATRA. This was in line with time- and dose-dependent increase of total C/EBP\u03b1 protein levels upon NAMPT treatment. Therefore, NAMPT overcomes transcriptional repression of C/EBP\u03b1 in HL-60 cells by activation of positive CEBPA autoregulation. Taken together, we described a new mechanism of regulation of C/EBP\u03b1 activities in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis by its post-translational modification via NAMPT/SIRT1-triggered de-/acetylation.
