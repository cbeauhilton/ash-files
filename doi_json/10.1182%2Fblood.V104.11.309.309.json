    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Combination chemotherapy can cure patients (pts) with Hodgkin lymphoma (HD), but those with treatment failure or relapse still have a poor prognosis. We thus, designed a dose- and time-intensified high-dose sequential chemotherapy regimen with a final myeloablative course. Patients and Methods: Eligibility criteria included age 18\u201365 years, histologically proven primary progressive (PD) or relapsed HD. Treatment consists of two cycles DHAP (dexamethasone 40mg d1-4, high-dose cytarabin 2g/m2 12q d2, cisplatinum 100mg/m2 d1); pts with partial (PR) or complete remission (CR) received cyclophosphamide 4g/m2, followed by peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest; methotrexate 8g/m2 plus vincristine 1,4mg/m2; and etoposide 2g/m2. The final myeloblative course was BEAM followed by PBSCT. Results: 102 pts (median age 34 years, range 18\u201364) were enrolled. The response rate (RR) at the final evaluation (100 days posttransplantation) was 80% (72% CR, 8% PR). PBSC harvest was succesful in 96% of pts. Toxicity was tolerable. With a median follow-up of 30 months (range 3\u201361 months) freedom from second failure (FF2F) and overall survival (OS) were 59% and 78% for all patients, respectively. FF2F and OS for patients with early relapse were 62% and 81%, for late relapse 65% and 81%; for PD: 41% and 48% and for multiple relapse 39% and 48%, respectively. In multivariate analysis response after 2 cycles of DHAP (p < 0.0001) and duration of first remission (PD and multiple relapse vs. early and late relapse; p = 0.0127) were prognostic factors for FF2F. Response after DHAP (p < 0.0081), duration of first remission (p = 0.0017) and anemia (p = 0.019) were identified as prognostic factors for OS. Conclusion: We conclude that this regimen is feasible, tolerable and highly effective in poor risk patients with relapsed and refractory HD. Based on these results a prospective randomized european intergoup study was started comparing this intensified regimen with two courses of DHAP followed by BEAM (HD-R2 protocol). First results of the second interim analysis of this study will be presented."
