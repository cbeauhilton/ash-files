    "abstract_text": "Background: The p53 tumor suppressor gene has a common sequence polymorphism that results in either proline or arginine at amino-acid position 72. The Pro72 and Arg72 variants have been reported to differ in its functional activity. The Arg72 variant induces apoptosis more efficiently than Pro72 variant by its greater ability to localize to the mitochondria and increase the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that Arg72 variant was a better suppressor of cellular transformation, an activity believed to rely on the pro-apoptotic function of p53 . Moreover, the Pro72 variant has been associated with a higher incidence of tumors. Aim: To evaluate the effect of the polymorphic variants of codon 72 and clinical outcome in patients with plasma cell malignancies. Patients and Methods: We analyzed 79 patients with plasma cell malignancies seen at Mayo Clinic between 2000 and 2003. Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ sorted plasma cell from bone marrow aspirates. PCR amplification of codon 72 and posterior sequencing was used for the analysis. Results: A total of 79 patients were analyzed. Thirty-four patients (34%) were heterozygous for p53 , 57 (59%) homozygous for Arginine and 6 (6%) homozygous for Proline . The distribution among disorders was as follow, 52 patients had MM, 14 patients with SMM and 13 with MGUS. Among patient with MM 25% were Pro/Arg heterozygous, 71 % were Arg/Arg homozygous and 3.8% Pro/Pro homozygous. Survival data among MM patients and genotype were analyzed to Kaplan- Meier method. No significant differences were found among patients who carried homozygous (72R) or heterozygous genotype and overall survival. We exclude the analysis in MGUS and SMM for a low number of patients available. Conclusions: These findings indicate that codon 72 arginine p53 may not be associated with a prolonged survival in patients with Multiple Myeloma, but further study is needed to assess whether this polymorphism is associated with progression of MGUS to MM, age of onset, clinical manifestations, response to treatment etc.",
