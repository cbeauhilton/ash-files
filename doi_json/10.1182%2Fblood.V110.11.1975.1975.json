    "abstract_text": "Current CGVHD prognostic and staging systems are still undergoing development and have identified plt count; CGVHD types progressive(P), quiescent(Q), de novo(DN); KPS, and GI involvement as significant risk factors affecting outcome. A simple reproducible staging system such as used for AGVHD to apply in clinical trials is still lacking. We evaluated whether the PSE dose required to control CGVHD at 3 months from diagnosis would have a prognostic effect on survival and in and of itself serve as a criteria for secondary intervention or investigational therapy. We hypothesized that by 3 months from start of treatment patients would be on the lowest dose dictated by medical necessity rather than by physician driven dose preference. A retrospective analysis of charts from 109 patients diagnosed with CGVHD between 6/2000 and 6/2003 was done. Data collected included age, donor type(mud/sib), plt count, CGVHD type(P/Q/DN), KPS, GI involvement. Outcome analysis included survival and cause of death. PSE dose was calculated in mg/kg at 3 months from first diagnosis of CGVHD. With a median follow up of 47.2 months(range 6.6\u201367.2) relapse censored survival of patients on a 3 month PSE dose of more than .3 mg/kg was 53% compared to all lower doses 86%(P.03). In a univariate analysis only PSE dose (P .05) and KPS (P <.01) were significant with plt count approaching significance (P .11). In a multivariate analysis again only PSE dose and KPS were significant (Table 1). Table  . . . . Univariate . . Multivariate . . Variable . Value . N . # of deaths .
