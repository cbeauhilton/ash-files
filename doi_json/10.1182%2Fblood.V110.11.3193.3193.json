    "abstract_text": "Background: In recent years, recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been used in non-hemophilia bleeding situations (factor VII deficiency, trauma, liver disease, uremia, surgical bleeding, platelet disorders, and intracranial hemorrhage) for achievement of hemostasis. Although, the risk of thrombosis in hemophilia patients with inhibitors receiving rFVIIa is quite low, its use in other clinical situations has been complicated by some reports of thrombotic events. Recently, rFVIIa has been used to treat coagulopathic and/or bleeding neonates with good success. However, the prevalence of thrombotic events in these neonates is completely unknown. This study was initiated to determine the risk of thrombotic events associated with rFVIIa use in neonates. Methods: We reviewed all published literature in neonates receiving rFVIIa. In addition, we reviewed all data submitted to the SeveN Bleep Registry, a database developed by the scientific standardization subcommittee on pediatric and neonatal hemostasis of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) to record all uses of rFVIIa in pediatric non-hemophilic patients. As the baseline prevalence of thrombosis for bleeding and/or coagulopathic neonates is also unknown, we also reviewed the records of 100 consecutive neonates from a single institution who received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) alone to treat their coagulopathy and/or bleeding. Results: A total of 98 non-hemophilic neonates received rFVIIa. The majority of these neonates received rFVIIa only after failing to achieve hemostasis with standard care (FFP, cryoprecipitate, platelet transfusions). Of those receiving rFVIIa, 7 had a thrombotic event reported. In the control group that received FFP alone, 7 neonates also suffered a thrombotic event. Although the risk of thrombosis in these two groups is similar, neonates receiving rFVIIa tended to have indwelling line related thrombosis, while those receiving FFP tended to have strokes or myocardial insults. Overall the prevalence of thrombotic events in bleeding and/or coagulopathic neonates appears to be 7%, whether or not they received rFVIIa. Conclusions: In this study, the overall prevalence of thrombotic events was similar in the rFVIIa and FFP group. As data for this study was collected in a retrospective manor, and thereby subject to publication and submission bias, a more accurate determination of the prevalence of thrombosis in neonates will require a prospective study.",
