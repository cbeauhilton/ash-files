    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3222 To date, MLL -rearranged infant Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) remains the most aggressive type of childhood leukemia characterized by a high rate of early relapses and a grim prognosis. This type of leukemia arises from chromosomal translocations involving the Mixed Lineage Leukemia ( MLL ) gene. The genesis of such translocations seems to be initiated in utero . Hence, MLL -rearranged ALL is typically diagnosed in infants at or shortly after birth. The most common MLL translocation among infant ALL patients, occurring in about 50% of the cases, is t(4;11) generating the oncogenic fusion product MLL -AF4. MLL -rearranged ALL is distinguishable from other ALL subtypes by unique gene-expression profiles. While inappropriate gene activation seems to be largely driven by specific histone modifications, we recently showed that gene inactivation in MLL -rearranged infant ALL can be explained by aberrant promoter hypermethylation. Focusing on genome-wide DNA methylation, we here uncovered that MLL -rearranged infant ALL is characterized by the activation of particular set of (proto-onco)genes as a result of abnormal promoter hypomethylation. In search for therapeutic agents capable of targeting these potential cancer-promoting genes, we applied connectivity mapping on a gene expression signature based on the genes most significantly hypomethylated in t(4;11)-positive infant ALL as compared with healthy bone marrows. Connectivity map analyses revealed that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors represent the most suitable compounds to reverse this gene signature. We show that six different HDAC inhibitors effectively induce leukemic cell death in primary t(4;11)-positive infant ALL cells in vitro. These cytotoxic responses were accompanied by down-regulation of MYC , SET , RUNX1 and RAN , and were preceded by degradation of the oncogenic MLL-AF4 fusion product. Our data shows that DNA methylation profiles allow the identification hypomethylated proto-oncogenes, and underlines the essential role for epigenetic de-regulation in MLL -rearranged ALL. Furthermore, we show for the first time that connectivity mapping can indirectly be applied on DNA methylation patterns, providing a rationale for HDAC inhibition in t(4;11)-positive leukemias. Given the presented potential of HDAC inhibitors to target important proto-oncogenes including the leukemia-driving MLL fusion in vitro , these agents should urgently be tested in in vivo models and subsequent clinical trials.
