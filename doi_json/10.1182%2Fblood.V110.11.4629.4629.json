    "abstract_text": "The epigenetic gene silencing associated with promoter DNA methylation is as powerful as gene mutations in functionally inactivating tumor suppressor genes. Thus, a non-intensive treatment may be changed the natural history of MDS for the first time by the demethylating agent, 5-aza-deoxycytidine (Decitabine) with silenced gene expression by reversal of p15 hypermethylation and protein expression in the bone marrow in MDS. The MS-MLPA (methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification) ME-001B probemix (MRC-Holland) containing 25 tumor suppressor genes has been used to detect the methylation level in the peripheral blood samples of 29 MDS before azacitidine (Vidaza) and only 6 MDS after 3\u20135 courses of therapy. Patients that hypermethylated at least 1 gene were 7 of 29, either the common hypermethylating genes as p15, ESR1 or the previously known FHIT in MDS also have occurred. Only two patients except one patient related to either methylation level-reducing gene or removal methylated gene (putative demethylation reversal) have in concordance with clinical response in hematological evidence. Interestingly, three other patients were high methylation level persistently or additional methylated gene after treatment (putative demethylation no reversal or more severe), two patients of these are correspond with no clinical response and one is propensity to progressing leukemia. With IGSF4 gene hypermethylation, to the best of our knowledge, there was no report in MDS. Our results suggest that methylation level possibly contributes to the dignosistic, prognosistic and a molecular monitoring marker after treatment of Azacitidine."
