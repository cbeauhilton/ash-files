    "abstract_text": "We report the case of a 12 year old girl admitted to the hospital in August 2004 presenting acute hepatic failure with grade IV encephalopathy without stigmatic of chronic liver disease. Investigation for A, B and C hepatitis was negative as well as the tests for HIV, Toxoplasmosis, EBV, B19 parvovirus and CMV. Diagnosed as fulminant hepatitis she received an ortotopic hepatic transplant 25 days after admission. She had an excellent clinical recovery on tracolimus for immunossupression, except for an asymptomatic pancytopenia unresponsive to drug dose reduction, which progressed to severe bone marrow aplasia in a four months period. A second round of virus screening tests was still negative. She was then submitted to bone marrow transplantation from her twin identical sister utilizing 50mg/kg/day of cyclophosphamide for two days as conditioning regimen. She received 6.6 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg and engrafted at D+22. She was discharged at D+ 33 on tracolimus without any sign of liver or bone marrow rejection. She is presently in complete clinical recovery after 7 months of BMT. This is, from our knowledge, the first report of a successful hepatic transplant followed by an equally successful syngeneic bone marrow transplant.",
