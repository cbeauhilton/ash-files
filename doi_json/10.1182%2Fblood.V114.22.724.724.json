    "abstract_text": "Abstract 724 Background: Programmed death (PD)\u20131 is an inhibitory receptor that impairs the function of activated T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells when engaged by its ligands PD-L1 or PD-L2. We have previously demonstrated that PD-1 is markedly up-regulated in intratumoral and peripheral blood CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), a finding associated with impaired T-cell function, suggesting that PD-1 blockade may improve FL immune control. CT-011, a humanized anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody, was previously studied in a phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. CT-011 was well tolerated and induced sustained elevations of CD4 + T cells in the peripheral blood. More importantly, apparent clinical benefit was observed in six patients, including one patient with FL who had large tumor masses that achieved a durable complete remission lasting >14 months. Here, we studied the in vitro and in vivo effects of CT-011 on T-cell and/or NK-cell immune responses against human B-cell lymphoma and the hypothesis that CT-011 may improve tumor control when combined with rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of human FL. Materials and Methods: To determine the effects of CT-011 on antitumor T cells, intratumoral T cells were isolated from primary FL tumor samples, and cultured with or without autologous tumor cells in the presence or absence of CT-011 or isotype control antibody (50 \u03bcg/ml each) for 5 days, and tested for proliferation by 3 H thymidine incorporation assay. To determine the effects of CT-011 on NK cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from normal donors or patients with FL were cultured in the presence or absence of CT-011 (50 \u03bcg/ml) with or without IL-2 for 96 hours and analyzed for expression of various activating receptors including CD16, CD32, CD64, Fas ligand, NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46. The in vivo effects of CT-011 were tested in two B-cell lymphoma xenograft models. Ramos and RL lymphoma tumor cells were injected subcutaneously into nude and SCID mice, respectively, and CT-011 (10 \u03bcg/mouse) was injected weekly with or without rituximab starting approximately 7\u201310 days after tumor inoculation. Results: We observed that CT-011 significantly increased the proliferation of intratumoral T cells in response to autologous tumor cells compared with isotype control antibody. Treatment with CT-011 enhanced the expression of Fas ligand, CD32, CD64, and NKp30 on human NK cells in the presence of IL-2 as compared with PBMCs treated with IL-2 alone or media control. In the RL lymphoma xenograft model in SCID mice, treatment with CT-011 significantly delayed tumor growth (P\u22640.05) and improved survival (P\u22640.01) compared with control mice injected with saline. In a Ramos lymphoma xenograft model in nude mice, treatment with CT-011 and rituximab eradicated established tumors in a significant proportion of mice (P\u22640.05) and markedly improved survival compared with rituximab alone or saline. Conclusions: Taken together, these studies suggest that blockade of PD-1 with CT-011 enhances the function of anti-tumor T-cells and augments the expression of activating receptors on NK cells. Treatment with CT-011 led to improved tumor control against human B-cell lymphoma in xenograft models and the combined use of CT-011 and rituximab was more effective that rituximab alone. These results provide the rationale to test the combination of CT-011 with rituximab in patients with B-cell lymphoma, given that the combination is likely to be complementary and may even be synergistic, leading to enhanced clinical efficacy without increasing toxicity. The development of such approaches that activate both the innate (NK-cells) and adaptive (T-cells) immune systems is likely to minimize the emergence of immune escape variants and improve clinical outcome in patients with lymphoma. A clinical trial evaluating CT-011 in combination with rituximab is planned in patients with relapsed FL. Disclosures: Rodionov: Cure Tech Ltd.: Employment.
