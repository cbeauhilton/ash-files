    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2999 Multiple myeloma (MM) is a treatable but incurable hematological malignancy and novel targeted therapies are under investigation. MM is characterized by dysregulation of the cell cycle, consequent to the overexpression of cyclins and their related kinases, the cyclins dependent kinases (CDK), a group of Ser/Thr proteine kinases. CDKs represent a promising therapeutic target, and inhibitors have been developed for anticancer treatment. We have previously studied seliciclib in the context of MM. CYC065, a second generation CDK inhibitor is the more potent derivative of seliciclib. It is mainly active on CDK 2, 5 and 9, involved in progression of the cell cycle and protein transcription. It has already shown promising results in preclinical studies in breast cancer and acute leukemia. We tested CYC065 in in vitro experiments in MM. Our preliminary data in 7 MM cell lines showed cytotoxicity of CYC065, both in MM cell lines sensitive as well as resistant to conventional chemotherapy, with an IC50 ranging between 0.06 and 2\u03bc M, at 24 and 48h. Tritiated thymidine uptake assay confirmed the antiproliferative effects of CYC065 in MM, and its ability to overcome the growth advantage conferred by co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells derived from MM patients, and cytokines like interleukin 6 (10ng/ml) and insulin like growth factor-1 (50ng/ml). The anti-proliferative effect was evident both at 24 and 48h, starting at concentrations as low as 0.015\u03bc M. The AnnexinV/PI assay in the MM1.s cell line confirmed CYC065's ability to induce apoptosis in a time dependent manner starting at 9 hours of treatment, at a concentration of 0.125 \u03bc M, inducing 82% of apoptosis after 48h of exposure. Cell cycle analysis in the same MM1.s cell line showed an increase of subG1 phase, starting at 9 hours of treatment, at 0.125 \u03bc M of CYC065. Preliminary results of western blot analysis confirmed the apoptotic effect of CYC065 in the MM1s cell line, highlighted by the cleavage of caspase 3, 8, 9 and PARP. The compound was tested in primary CD138+ cells isolated from three refractory MM patients, confirming its efficacy at 0.125 \u03bc M, both at 24 and 48h. Comparative analysis in PBMCs from normal donors, for the evaluation of the drug toxicity is ongoing and will be presented. In conclusion our preliminary data confirm the efficacy of CYC065 in MM cell lines and primary MM cells, at nanomolar concentrations. Ongoing mechanistic and in vivo studies will delineate its role in the now increasing spectrum of CDK inhibitors in MM and better define its potential for clinical development in MM.
