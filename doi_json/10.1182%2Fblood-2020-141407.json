    "abstract_text": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are aggressive hematologic malignancies characterized by the accumulation of lymphoid cells defective in cell apoptosis biology and function. The anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family proteins are pivotal regulators of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and genetic aberrations in these genes are associated with lymphomagenesis and chemotherapeutic resistance. Notably, the anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) protein is recurrently highly expressed in various kinds of non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphomas and promotes the survival of lymphoma cells by counteracting pro-apoptotic protein activity. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that MCL-1 plays a central role in B-cell lymphoma progression and drug resistance. Pharmacologically targeting MCL-1, therefore, represents an attractive strategy to combat these lymphomas. However, previous clinical and pre-clinical data suggest that treatment with single agent anti-BCL-2 family member therapy is associated with rapid acquisition of resistance. To this end, there is a great need to develop and apply selective small molecule MCL-1 inhibitors as part of a first-line therapy or upon emergence of tumor resistance characterized by upregulation of MCL-1 for lymphoma therapy. Here, we exploited the MCL-1 dependency in MCL and DLBCL by implementing pharmacogenomic and chemical proteomic approaches to investigate the molecular drug response and resistance mechanism to MCL-1 inhibitors. In anticipation of the evolution of MCL-1 inhibitor resistance, we modeled MCL-1 inhibitor resistance mechanisms by developing S63845 resistant lines with high doses of S63845 treatment for an extended period in MCL, DLBCL and MCL-derived lines. RNA sequencing and chemical proteomics on paired parental and resistant cells demonstrated that transcriptome and kinome reprograming linked to the MEK and ERK pathways contribute to MCL-1 inhibitor resistance via regulation of the BCL-2 family profile (BCL-2 and BIM), and as such, represent a novel targetable vulnerability in MCL-1 inhibitor resistant lymphoma. Additional analyses revealed synergistic activity of MCL-1 inhibitors (S63845, AZD5991) in combinations with inhibitors of MEK (Trametinib), ERK (SCH772984) and BCR (Ibrutinib) in MCL-1 inhibitor resistant MCL/DLBCL lines and primary samples. These results provide a strong rationale for further evaluation of MCL-1 inhibitor in combination with established therapy in the clinical setting and highlight a potential strategy for overcoming MCL-1 inhibitor resistance.
