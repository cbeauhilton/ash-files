    "abstract_text": "It is increasingly clear that the bone marrow is comprised of a heterogeneous complex of niches for hematopoietic cells, some for stem cells in the perivascular space and some for progenitors. We have used two approaches to define the role of specific cells in the marrow. First, single cell selection and characterization based on in vivo proximity to HSPC. This method has defined a subset of endosteal lining cells that can be immunophenotypically defined and isolated and reveals IL-18 as a regulator of hematopoietic progenitor quiescence. Second, candidate cell depletion that revealed mature osteolineage cells expressing osteocalcin as regulating the production of thymic emigrants through the expression of Dll4. Deletion of these cells reduces the number and function of T-biased lymphoid progenitors in the marrow space as well as thymic populations and mature T cells in the blood. These data suggest that specific niche subsets can be defined and through them, novel molecular regulators of HSPC function. The bone marrow niche is a heterogeneous composite of distinctive niches.
