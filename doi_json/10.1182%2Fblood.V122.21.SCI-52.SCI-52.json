    "abstract_text": "Platelets interact with a variety of cells, including leukocytes and progenitor cells. Upon activation, platelets release chemokines such as CXCL12/SDF-1 that modulate important functional aspects of vascular inflammation and atherogenesis. Platelet-derived SDF-1 and CyPA regulate chemotaxis, migration, and cell activation in the microenvironment of accumulating platelets. Previously we have shown that platelets are the major source of CXCL12/SDF-1. Platelet-derived SDF-1 provides a strong signal for recruitment of circulating progenitor cells and leukocytes towards vascular and myocardial injury. Patients with severe coronary artery disease have enhanced levels of plasma and platelet-associated SDF-1 that correlates with an enhanced number of circulating progenitor cells and the development of cardiovascular diseases. In patients with both acute myocardial infarction platelet-SDF-1 and an increase in circulating platelet/progenitor cell aggregates, the combination is associated with myocardial recovery and improved prognosis, indicating that platelet-SDF-1 is critical for repair and regeneration of vascular or myocardial injury. Administration of a stable recombinant SDF-1 fusion protein reduces infarct size and preserves myocardial infarction in mice. We showed that platelet-derived SDF-1 is an important survival factor both for platelets (in an autocrine manner) and for surrounding cells. SDF-1 released from activated platelets binds to its receptor CXCR4 and induces internalization of the SDF-1/CXCR4 complex. SDF-1-ligation of CXCR4 augments surface expression of CXCR7; a process coupled via ERK1/2 and cyclophilin A. SDF-1\u03b1 caused downstream phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and cyclophilin A (CyPA). NIM-811 a CyPA-PPIase-activity inhibitor significantly abolished SDF-1\u03b1-driven CXCR7 surface exposure. Moreover, Cypa -/- murine platelets failed to show SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR4-mediated CXCR7 translocation. SDF-1\u03b1-induced ubiquitination of CXCR7 was essential for its surface translocation and was dependent on Erk1/2 and CyPA-PPIase activity, inhibited by U0126 and NIM-811, respectively. In contrast to wild-type, Cypa -/- murine platelets failed to exhibit a dynamic change in CXCR7 ubiquitination status upon SDF-1\u03b1 exposure and thus failed in subsequent CXCR7 externalization. SDF-1/CXR4-driven CXCR7 translocation inhibits activation-induced apoptosis of platelets and prolongs platelet survival in vitro and in vivo . Similarly, platelet SDF-1 interacts with monocytes, reduces apoptosis and promotes differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. Inhibition of platelet release and adhesion to endothelial cells reduces monocyte migration and differentiation into macrophages in vitro and attenuates vascular inflammation and atheroprogression in apoE-deficient mice. In conclusion, platelets and platelet interaction with leukocytes are critical in regulation of vascular inflammation and atheroprogression and may offer promising targets for modulating inflammation in disease states.
