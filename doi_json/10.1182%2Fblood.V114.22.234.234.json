    "abstract_text": "Abstract 234 Thymic GVHD (tGVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) is associated with prolonged immunodeficiency. We have previously shown that thymic output after allo-BMT is directly related to thymus size, and inversely related to donor T cell dose and GVHD severity. Additionally, radiation-containing preparative regimens upregulate the death receptors Fas and DR5 on thymic stroma (especially epithelium) while decreasing expression of the anti-apoptotic protein cFLIP, thereby sensitizing the thymus to GVHD. Moreover, small numbers of donor alloreactive T cells are sufficient to cause tGVHD, and they utilize the Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) and TRAIL/DR5 pathways to mediate damage thymic stroma, architecture and function. We performed experiments in both MHC-mismatched and MHC-matched minor antigen-disparate model systems, and demonstrated the exquisite sensitivity of the thymus to as few as 1\u20132.5\u00d710 5 donor T cells, which mediated tGVHD without evidence of overt clinical disease or significant weight loss. Additionally, tGVHD is partially reversible in our model systems (contingent on a low T cell dose), such that mice with tGVHD exhibit a transient but partially reversible decrease in thymic cellularity when measured at days 28 vs. 60 post-transplant ( Figure 1 ).

We treated recipients of T cell-depleted allo-BMT with the amDR5-1 agonistic antibody (0.2 mg i.p. per dose) either in the \u2018early\u2018 peri-transplant period, or \u2018late,\u2018 in the second week post-transplant. Allo-BMT recipients treated \u2018early\u2018 with amDR5-1 had significantly decreased thymic cellularity and splenic BM-derived T cells as compared with controls. Furthermore, we observed similar BM cellularity and BM-derived lineage \u2212 sca-1 + ckit + (LSK), all in the absence of donor alloreactive T cells and GVHD ( Figure 2 ). We observed similar results with mice treated \u2018late\u2018 amDR5-1 using the later schedule, which indicates that the thymus has continued sensitivity to TRAIL throughout the post-transplant period, and that GVHD and/or conditioning-associated cytokines are not required to enable TRAIL-mediated damage to the thymus. We further assessed the expression of DR5 on donor BM-derived thymocytes to determine whether amDR5-1 acted directly on thymocytes. We observed that on day 28 after T cell-depleted allo-BMT, only 1-2% of donor thymocytes expressed DR5, suggesting that amDR5-1 (and potentially TRAIL) mediate their effects on thymic cellularity and function primarily via an indirect mechanism ( Figure 3 ). These data suggest to us that significant damage to the thymus and thymopoiesis during allo-BMT: can be mediated by soluble TRAIL agonists, even without the presence of whole donor alloreactive T cells can occur, via the TRAIL pathway, without a full complement of the inflammatory processes typically associated with GVHD pathophysiology, including the cytokine storm, and can occur early and late post-transplant, and that early exposure of the thymus to TRAIL/DR5 signals are sufficient to cause a durable loss in thymic cellularity, donor CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes counts, and numbers of donor BM T cells exported to the periphery. ccurs via the TRAIL pathway, without significant direct damage (via TRAIL/DR5 interactions) to the bone marrow compartment, and thus by implication, thymic-seeding precursors derived from the BM. Together, our data in clinically-relevant mouse allo-BMT models suggests that the thymus is highly sensitive to GVHD and endures severe damage at relatively low levels of systemic GVHD. Moreover, post-transplant thymic atrophy is a partially-reversible process which depends on the T cell dose, and which occurs via the TRAIL pathway. Finally, we provide significant mechanistic insight which shows that TRAIL-mediated thymic damage can occur (1) throughout the early post-transplant period, and (2) does not strictly require alloreactive T cells, or the inflammatory processes associated with conditioning and GVHD.
