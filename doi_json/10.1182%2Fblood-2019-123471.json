    "abstract_text": "Rapidly proliferating cells reprogram metabolism to support increased biosynthetic demands, a feature that can expose targetable vulnerabilities for therapeutic intervention. A chemical biology screen was performed in an effort to identify metabolic vulnerabilities in particular tumor subtypes, and revealed potent and selective activity of a novel dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor, AG-636, in cancer cell lines of hematologic origin. In contrast, cancer cell lines of solid tumor origin exhibited comparatively poor sensitivity. Evaluation of a lymphoma cell line panel demonstrated broad responsiveness to DHODH inhibition, independent of clinical subtype (e.g. ABC, GCB, double-hit). The on-target cellular activity of AG-636 was evaluated by examining the metabolic effects of AG-636 on cells and by evaluating the ability of extracellular uridine to rescue the effects of AG-636 on proliferation and viability. The metabolic changes incurred upon treatment of cells with AG-636 were consistent with a mechanism of action driven by inhibition of DHODH and de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Supraphysiologic concentrations of extracellular uridine rescued the effects of AG-636 on growth and viability as well as the effects on metabolism, further confirming on-target activity. The mechanistic basis for differential sensitivity to AG-636 was assessed by comparing the activity of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and uridine salvage pathways in cancer cell lines of hematologic or solid tumor origin with similar proliferative rates. Differential response to AG-636 could not be attributed to varying abilities to utilize the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway or to salvage extracellular uridine. Real-time imaging of cells treated with AG-636, along with monitoring of extracellular uridine concentrations, demonstrated immediate effects on the viability of lymphoma cell lines in the setting of depleted extracellular uridine. In contrast, solid tumor cell lines were able to maintain growth for an additional period of time, suggestive of adaptive mechanisms to supply pyrimidine pools and/or to cope with nucleotide stress. The high in vitro activity of AG-636 in cancer cells of hematologic origin translated to xenograft models, including an aggressive, patient-derived xenograft model of triple-hit lymphoma and an ibrutinib-resistant model of mantle cell lymphoma in which complete tumor regression occurred. These studies support the development of AG-636 for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. A phase 1 study has been initiated in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma (NCT03834584).
