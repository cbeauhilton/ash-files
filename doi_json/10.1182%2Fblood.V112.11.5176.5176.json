    "abstract_text": "It has been proposed that treatment failures in multiple myeloma (MM) are related to the chemoresistance of a subset of malignant myeloma cells with clonogenic potential to the anti-myeloma drugs ( Matsui et al., Cancer Research  2008 , 68 : 190 ). Studies suggest that these putative myeloma stem cells (MSC) are CD138 neg and express CD20, which is usually absent in more differentiated malignant plasma cells ( Matsui et al., Blood  2004 , 15 : 2332 ). These findings provided a rationale for a treatment strategy to eliminate chemoresistant clonogenic MSC using anti-CD20 antibodies. To evaluate the clinical effects of anti-CD20 treatment, we developed a phase II trial with Bexxar as a consolidation treatment for MM. We hypothesized that Bexxar would be more efficacious than unlabeled antibody in the eradication of highly radiosensitive myeloma cells by both direct and cross-fire effects. Preclinical studies showed that tositumomab, the antibody used in Bexxar, inhibited colony formation of clonogenic myeloma cells. To be eligible for Bexxar treatment, patients must have completed at least 4 cycles of therapy (1 st to 3 rd line) and have measurable disease in a plateau of at least partial response (PR). To date, 10 of 30 patients have been enrolled, of which 5 were treated with Bexxar after completion of initial therapy prior to proceeding to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Patients proceeding to ASCT required hematopoietic stem cells collection prior to Bexxar and 3 months after Bexxar. Eight patients are evaluable for response and toxicities. At 3 months post Bexxar, 1 patient achieved a partial response (PR), 4 patients had stable disease (SD), and 1 patient progressed (PD). At 1 year post Bexxar, 1 patient with initial PR achieved CR and remains in CR, 1 patient is in unconfirmed CR, 2 are in partial response (PR), and 3 remain in SD. After a median 20 months of followup (range 4\u201324), all patient are alive, 4 in continued response, 3 with SD. Hematological toxicities were mild to moderate (1 patient grade 3 and 4 patients grade 2 thrombocytopenia, 4 patients grade 2 neutropenia). Non-hematological toxicity was limited to HAMA (6 patients). Out of patients who received Bexxar prior to transplant, 3 collected stem cells post-Bexxar without problems, one requires re-collection. Three patients who proceeded to ASCT to date using the post-Bexxar stem cell collection, engrafted at 11\u201312 days, and had no unexpected toxicities with ASCT. We also analyzed CD20 + cells in bone marrow aspirates (BM) and stem cell collections (SCC) using samples collected from 4 patients before and after Bexxar. Bexxar treatment eliminated a median 80% of CD20 + cells (range 23\u201397). For a given patient, elimination of CD20 + cells from SCC correlated with elimination of CD20 + cells from BM. The most complete elimination of CD20 + cells from BM was observed in 2 patients who at 1 year achieved CR (94% and 97%), compared to patients who achieved PR (23% and 68%). We conclude that anti-CD20 consolidation treatment of myeloma patients with Bexxar used as targeted therapy against clonogenic myeloma cells is feasible and well tolerated. Clinical outcomes to date are encouraging considering that clonogenic MSC represent <5% of malignant plasma cells and delayed responses observed in this study could be expected. While early, clinical outcomes appear to correlate with the efficacy of the CD20 + cell elimination by Bexxar treatment in myeloma."
