    "abstract_text": "Conformational changes in von Willebrand factor (VWF) exposed at the injured vessel wall initiate glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-dependent platelet adhesion, and simultaneously trigger signaling cascades leading to integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 III activation, platelet spreading, and thrombus formation. The intracellular signaling protein 14-3-3\u03b6 and the membrane skeleton protein filamin A have been confirmed to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of GPIb\u03b1 and play key roles in regulating the VWF binding function of GPIb-IX. Several phosphoserine containing motifs in GPIb-IX complex, such as Ser 609 of GPIb\u03b1 and Ser 166 of GPIb\u03b2, have been confirmed to bind to 14-3-3\u03b6 and involved in the regulation of VWF binding function. We have recently identified a novel 14-3-3\u03b6 binding site located in the filamin A binding domain of GPIb\u03b1 at Ser 559 . Phosphorylation of GPIb\u03b1 at Ser 559 not only is important for 14-3-3\u03b6 binding, but also plays a key role in the regulation of VWF binding function of GPIb-IX. However, the protein kinase responsible for Ser 559 phosphorylation remains unknown. Here we show that a peptide corresponding to the Arg 557 -Pro 561 region of GPIb\u03b1 and purified GPIb\u03b1 could be phosphorylated at Ser 559 by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA). Ser 559 phosphorylation was enhanced by PKA activators and reduced by PKA inhibitors in platelets and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing GPIb-IX. Furthermore, PKA inhibitor enhanced VWF binding to the CHO cells expressing GPIb-IX mutant replacing Ser 559 of GPIb\u03b1 (S559A) with alanine, while reduced in the CHO cells of Ser 166 of GPIb\u03b2 (S166A) with alanine. GPIb-IX association with filamin A and membrane expression were enhanced in S559A cells, whereas reduced in S166A cells. The peptide disrupting the interaction of 14-3-3\u03b6 with Ser 559 of GPIb\u03b1 inhibited platelet spreading on VWF matrix and GPIb-IX-VWF interaction-induced association of Src with GPIb-IX. These data indicate that Ser 559 of GPIb\u03b1 is phosphorylated by PKA which plays key roles in regulating VWF binding, surface expression, and signaling of GPIb-IX.
