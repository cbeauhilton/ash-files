    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2887 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains incurable despite advances in the biology and treatment of this disease. Current data support the notion that resistance to therapy is promoted by a \u201cprotective\u201d tumor microenvironment in which non-leukemia cells produce factors that enhance the resistance of CLL cells to spontaneous or drug-induced apoptosis. One such factor is the chemokine CXCL12, which interacts with its receptor CXCR4 on CLL cells to promote cancer cell survival. To examine the therapeutic potential of blocking CXCL12-CXCR4 interactions, we studied the effect of BMS-936564, a fully human IgG4 anti-CXCR4 antibody, using an in vitro co-culture model of human bone marrow derived stomal-NKter cells \u2013 leukemia cell interaction. Such stromal-NKter cells secrete CXCL12 and enhance the resistance of CLL cells to apoptosis in vitro . We observed that primary CLL cells co-cultured with stromal-NKter cells had significantly greater viability than CLL cells cultured alone (20\u201360% above baseline at 48 hours). Moreover, CLL cells co-cultured with stromal cells had enhanced resistance to drug-induced apoptosis. We found that BMS-936564 antibody at concentrations of 2\u2013200nM could enhance the rate of apoptosis of CLL cells cultured alone or in the presence of stromal cells. CLL cells that expressed unmutated IgVH genes or ZAP-70 appeared equally susceptible to treatment with BMS-936564 as did CLL cells that lack these adverse prognostic markers, as did CLL cells that harbored deletions in 17p13.2 and that were resistant to chemotherapeutic agents, such a fludarabine monophosphate. BMS-936564 antibody inhibited CXCL12 mediated F-Actin polymerization in CLL cells at lower concentrations (20\u2013200nM) compared to AMD-3100 (Mozobil), a small molecule CXCR4 inhibitor (50\u2013150\u03bcM). In addition, AMD-3100 did not induce apoptosis in CLL cells (10\u2013300\u03bcM). In summary, we observed that the anti-CXCR4 antibody BMS-936564 inhibited CXCL12 mediated activation of the CXCR4 receptor in CLL cells and induced apoptosis in leukemia cells. The pro-apoptotic activity of BMS-936564 was observed in cells cultured alone or together with stromal cells suggesting that this antibody had direct cytotoxic effect on leukemia cells and that it can overcome the protective tumor microenvironment. More over, the activity of BMS-936564 was independent of the presence of poor prognostic factors such as del(17p) suggesting that its mechanism of action is P53 independent. These findings show evidence that the CXCR4-CXCL12 pathway is a valid therapeutic target in CLL and provide additional biological rationale for ongoing clinical trials in CLL and other hematological malignancies using BMS-936564.
