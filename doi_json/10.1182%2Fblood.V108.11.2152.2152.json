    "abstract_text": "RQ-PCR for BCR-ABL is standard of care for monitoring patients with chronic myeloid leukemia on Abl kinase inhibitor therapy, and mutations in the kinase domain (KD) of BCR-ABL are the most frequent mechanism of acquired drug resistance. From a practical point of view, it is important to establish an RQ-PCR trigger for mutation analysis that is sufficiently sensitive, while avoiding a high rate of false positive results. In one study, a single 2-fold (0.3 log) rise in BCR-ABL transcript levels predicted mutations in 61% ( 1 ). However, the results were not confirmed in a similar study( 2 ). We therefore analyzed the correlation between a slightly more conservative 0.5 log rise in RQ-PCR levels and mutation detection in an unselected cohort of imatinib-treated CML patients. A database search identified 273 samples (from 150 patients) with a half-log or greater RQ-PCR rise. Mutation analysis (by direct DNA sequencing) has been completed on 54 samples. BCR-ABL levels were higher in 44 samples with successful amplification and sequencing compared to 10 without sufficiently good sequencing quality [median log-drop 0.31 (range \u22121.2 \u2212 2.4) vs. 2.2 (range 0.17 \u2013 3.2), p0.5 log RQ-PCR increase were from 34 different patients. Eleven of these 34 patients had cytogenetic or hematologic progression at the time of the mutation analysis and 7 never achieved even a partial cytogenetic response (<65%). Of 16 remaining eligible patients, 9 subsequently relapsed at a median of 5.8 (range 2.6\u201317) months after mutation detection. Freedom from progression was shorter in patients with a half-log RQ-PCR increase compared to patients without (34 months from imatinib start vs. median survival not reached, p = 0.019). Conclusion: In our hands, a half-log increase of BCR-ABL levels is associated with mutation detection in 25% of samples, yields a significantly increased risk of subsequent relapse, and may be used as a practical trigger for kinase domain sequencing. Analysis of additional samples is ongoing to determine the ideal trigger level that optimizes specificity and sensitivity.",
