    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a red blood cell disorder caused by a single nucleotide mutation in the \u03b2-globin gene ( HBB ). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only available cure, but is available to only a minority of patients and can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing may provide a permanent cure for SCD patients by correcting the sickle mutation in HBB in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Previously, we achieved ~39% sickle mutation correction in SCD HSPCs by delivering S. pyogenes ( Spy ) Cas9/R-66S gRNA as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODN) corrective donor template. S. aureus ( Sau ) Cas9 has potentially advantageous properties to improve therapeutic gene editing efficiency and safety, including smaller size allowing for efficient in vivo delivery and longer Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence for higher specificity. However, although in general, the cutting efficiency of Sau Cas9 is lower than Sp yCas9, the differences in gene correction and other gene-editing outcomes between Spy Cas9 and Sau Cas9 have not been well studied. Methods: With our R-66S gRNA sequence targeting the sickle mutation, the PAM sequence of Sau Cas9 (NGGRRT) is mutually permissive with that of Spy Cas9 (NGG), allowing the same sequence to be targeted by both Cas9 nucleases. We delivered R-66S gRNA with Spy Cas9 and Sau Cas9 respectively as RNP, along with corrective ssODN donor template into SCD HSPCs. We analyzed sickle mutation correction rate and small insertions and deletions (INDELs) profile by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Results/discussions: We found that although the INDEL rate of Spy Cas9 is higher than Sau Cas9 at the same molar concentration of RNP, Sau Cas9 gave 43% sickle mutation correction, slightly higher than Spy Cas9 (39%), demonstrating efficient homology-directed repair (HDR) mediated gene correction by Sau Cas9. To further investigate the potential for clinical translation, we will perform in-depth efficiency and safety characterization comparing Sau Cas9 and Spy Cas9 mediated sickle mutation correction therapy in SCD HSPCs. Conclusion: In this work, we showed that, compared with the highly-optimized and widely-used Spy Cas9, Sau Cas9 leads to a higher sickle mutation correction in SCD HSPCs, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of Sau Cas9 for treating SCD. We will further investigate the efficiency and safety of gene-edited therapy mediated by these two Cas9 orthologs, including in-depth characterization of off-target effects, chromosomal rearrangement and aberrations, and large genomic modifications. We will differentiate gene-corrected SCD HSPCs to study erythropoiesis and red cell phenotype, including normal hemoglobin production and reduced sickling under hypoxic conditions. Lastly, we will evaluate the engraftment efficiency of gene-edited cells in Nonirradiated NOD,B6.SCID Il2r\u03b3 -/- Kit (W41/W41) (NBSGW) mice that support the engraftment of human hematopoietic stem cells.
