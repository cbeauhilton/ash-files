    "abstract_text": "Abstract 584 Specific T-cell responses are initiated by T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptide-MHC-complexes on antigen presenting cells (APCs). Upon specific interaction of T cells with APCs T cells capture membrane fragments and surface molecules of APCs in a process termed trogocytosis. Exchange of membrane molecules/antigens between immune cells has been observed for a long time, but the mechanisms and functional consequences of these transfers remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that human antigen-specific CD8 + T cells do acquire the co-inhibitory molecule programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) from mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mDC) and tumor cells in an antigen-specific manner. The kinetics of PD-L1 transfer revealed a maximal PD-L1 expression on antigen-specific T cells within 3\u20134 hours after co-incubation with antigen-pulsed APCs, being detectable up to 72 hours. Antigen-pulsed immature DCs were less effective in transfering surface molecules such as PD-L1 onto CD8 + T cells after antigen-specific recognition. Using a transwell system we could show that the acquisition of PD-L1 requires cell-cell contact. Furthermore, PD-L1 cannot be acquired by T cells from a lysate of mDCs. The transfer process is impaired after pretreatment of T cells with concanamycin A, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar ATPases, playing an important role in membrane trafficking. Moreover, fixation of DCs with glutaraldehyde completely abrogated the acquisition of PD-L1 on T cells suggesting that an active interaction between APCs and T cells is required for trogocytosis. Of importance, CD8 + T cells which acquired PD-L1 complexes, were able to induce apoptosis of neighbouring PD-1 expressing CD8 + T cells, that could be completely blocked by an anti-PD-L1 antibody. In summary our data demonstrate for the first time that human antigen-specific CD8 + T cells take up functionally active PD-L1 from APCs in an antigen-specific fashion, leading to apoptosis of PD-1 expressing T cells. The transfer of functionally active co-inhibitory molecules from APCs onto human CD8 + T cells may serve to limit clonal expansion of antigen-specific T-cell responses but may also play a major role for T-cell exhaustion in chronic infection and tumor immunosurveillance.
