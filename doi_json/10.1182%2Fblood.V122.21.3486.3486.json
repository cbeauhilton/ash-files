    "abstract_text": "The human adaptive immune system is composed of both B and T cells that undergo somatic recombination at specific loci to create rearrangements of Variable (V), Diversity (D) and Joining (J) gene segments. For the B-cell immunoglobin receptor heavy-chain (IGH), the CDR3 regions are defined by the VDJ gene segments and nucleotide insertions/deletions at these junctions that create the vast sequence diversity of the IGH repertoire. Characterizing the germline DNA in these regions is impeded by the high sequence similarity between gene segments, mutation and copy-number variation (i.e. large insertions/deletions). Currently, there is a fundamental lack of information about the baseline IGH immune repertoire V gene usage and diversity within healthy human controls. To provide an estimate of this, we sequenced functionally recombined gene segments to infer the underlying gene structure. From a set of 132 healthy controls we sorted C19+/CD27+ B-cells from whole blood and amplified genomic DNA using a highly multiplexed PCR assay that targeted the rearranged IGH receptor locus. Following DNA sequencing and data processing to assign V, D and J gene families and names, we examined the usage frequency of IGHV gene segments across all individuals. We found that of the 98 V gene segments only 56 (57%) were used at a frequency > 0.1%, and \u223c10 showed little to no usage (present in<1% of individuals). This data also allowed us to identify two IGHV genes currently annotated as orphons (pseudogenes assigned to an alternate chromosomal location) that had unambiguous functional usage (IGHV4/OR15-8; IGHV3/OR16-09) and therefore must reside at the IGH locus on chromosome 14. Finally, by taking this functional approach we were able to screen all V gene segments for germline copy-number variation (e.g. large insertion/deletion events encompassing individual genes) by looking for an excess of deletion events or modal changes in gene usage. We confirmed that existence of 12 of 15 previously identified deleted IGHV gene segments. Strong deletion evidence was observed for an additional six IGHV genes (IGHV3-NL1, IGHV3-33, IGHV1-24, IGHV4-04, IGHV3-41, IGHV3-35) and ten with highly likely germline deletion events. These data suggest that functional immune profiling of rearranged immune receptors provides a more robust method of identifying individual structural variation and provides insight into the immune repertoire of healthy controls.
