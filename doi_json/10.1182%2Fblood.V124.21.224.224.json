    "abstract_text": "Accumulating evidences have shown that mouse monocytes can be divided into two subsets, based on the expression of a surface marker Ly6C. Although distinct functions of Ly6C + monocytes (also called classical or inflammatory monocytes) and Ly6C \u2013 monocytes (also known as patrolling monocytes) have been gradually uncovered, molecular mechanisms which govern development of these monocytes remain largely unknown. We have previously reported the requirement of CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein \u03b2 (C/EBP\u03b2), a leucine zipper transcription factor, for \u2018emergency\u2019 granulopoiesis (Nat Immunol, 2006, J Immunol, 2012, Leukemia 2013). C/EBP\u03b2 is also known to play roles in the differentiation and function of macrophages. However, involvement of C/EBP\u03b2 in monocyte development has not been fully investigated. The aim of this study is to elucidate the roles of C/EBP\u03b2 in monopoiesis. First, we measured C/EBP\u03b2 mRNA expression in purified hematopoietic stem cells, myeloid progenitors and monocyte subsets, and found that monocytes, especially Ly6C \u2013 monocytes, expressed C/EBP\u03b2 mRNA at extremely higher level than any of other cell types examined. When we analyzed peripheral blood, the frequencies of total monocytes (CD11b + CD115 + cells) in C/EBP\u03b2 \u2013 / \u2013 mice was significantly lower than those in wild type (WT) mice (4.24\u00b12.71% in WT mice vs. 0.72\u00b10.50% in C/EBP\u03b2 \u2013 / \u2013 mice, p<0.001). Of note, Ly6C \u2013 monocytes were almost absent in peripheral blood of C/EBP\u03b2 \u2013/\u2013 mice (0.67\u00b10.57% in WT mice vs. 0.017\u00b10.021% in C/EBP\u03b2 \u2013/\u2013 mice). In order to clarify whether the defects in C/EBP\u03b2 \u2013/\u2013 monopoiesis were cell-intrinsic or cell-extrinsic, we generated mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeras by reconstituting lethally irradiated mice (CD45.1 + ) with BM cells from WT (CD45.1 + ) mice together with the equal number of BM cells from either WT or C/EBP\u03b2 \u2013/\u2013 (CD45.2 + ) mice. Six weeks after reconstitution, we confirmed that C/EBP\u03b2 \u2013/\u2013 BM-derived Ly6C \u2013 monocytes were absent in peripheral blood of the recipient mice, suggesting that monopoiesis in C/EBP\u03b2 \u2013/\u2013 mice is impaired in a cell-intrinsic manner. A recent report revealed that MX1-Cre transgenic system can be used for monocyte specific deletion of genes of interest, as MX1 is highly expressed by monocytes (Hashimoto D et al. Immunity 2013). In MX1-Cre + C/EBP\u03b2 floxed/floxed mice, the number of monocytes were decreased to the level similar to C/EBP\u03b2 \u2013/\u2013 mice, suggesting that C/EBP\u03b2 is specifically required in monocytes rather than other progenitors during monopoiesis. As cell cycle status of myeloid progenitors and monocytes did not differ between WT mice and C/EBP\u03b2 \u2013/\u2013 mice, we evaluated apoptosis by flow cytometry. The frequencies of late apoptotic/dead cells within Ly6C \u2013 monocytes in peripheral blood of C/EBP\u03b2 \u2013/\u2013 mice were significantly higher than those in peripheral blood of WT mice (5.84\u00b12.90% in WT mice vs. 50.4\u00b122.4% in C/EBP\u03b2 \u2013/\u2013 mice, p<0.001). These enhanced apoptosis of C/EBP\u03b2 \u2013/\u2013 Ly6C \u2013 monocyte was partially reversed by retroviral transduction of Bcl2 gene. Previous reports have shown that Nr4a1, CX3CR1 and S1PR5 are required for survival or BM egress of Ly6C \u2013 monocytes. We found that mRNA expressions of these factors are severely reduced in C/EBP\u03b2 \u2013/\u2013 Ly6C \u2013 monocytes. These results suggested that C/EBP\u03b2 maintains survival of Ly6C \u2013 monocytes through direct or indirect association of these molecules. Collectively, our data strongly indicate that C/EBP\u03b2 is essential for survival of Ly6C \u2013 monocytes. We are currently investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in the enhanced apoptosis of of Ly6C \u2013 monocytes in C/EBP\u03b2 \u2013/\u2013 mice.
