    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), hallmark of sickle-cell disease (SCD), is the first cause of patients' emergency room (ER) admissions and hospitalizations. Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a life-threatening complication that can occur during VOC and prolong hospitalization and is one of the main causes of death in SCD patients. The PRESEV score, established by team members and colleagues, assesses the risk of developing ACS (Bartolucci et al., 2016). In addition, the score has been validated by an international multicenter study, involving 13 centers, distributed in five different countries (PRESEV 2 - ASH 2020). Throughout the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, VOC management for SCD patients was a major concern. Our sickle cell referral center set up a hotline to monitor patients suffering from VOC daily, and organized the deployment of home-care services when required. The success of this system during the first wave of the pandemic led to the establishment of DREPADOM, a home-care and hospitalization protocol for VOC management in patients who are at a low risk of developing ACS, as standard care. DESCRIPTION OF SETTING Patients eligible for DREPADOM are patients that arrive at the ER for a VOC with a low PRESEV score, meaning low risk of developing ACS; or patients that are discharged early following hospitalization for VOC. After physical examination and calculation of the PRESEV score, DREPADOM home hospitalization is systematically offered to patients arriving to the ER with a PRESEV score \u2264 5. If the patient agrees, the DREPADOM nurse coordinator then acts as a link between the pharmacist, the oxygen supplier, the homecare provider, and the DREPADOM medical platform to activate the home hospitalization protocol. This entails the delivery of oxygen supply at the patient's house, dispatch of a medical prescription of opioids and parenteral treatments, twice/thrice-daily visits from homecare nurses, and an on-call SCD expert. DREPADOM relies on a system of daily telephone calls with three levels of expertise and warning and a decision-making algorithm. This is supervised by SCD experts, who arbitrate according to the evolution of the situation (stopping the follow-up, continuing the follow-up as an outpatient, hospitalization) (Fig.1). Furthermore, nurses enter patient vitals in real-time during their daily visits on a dedicated online platform (Link4Life) that contains an integrated automatic alert system. Additionally, a daily phone update between the DREPADOM coordination and the homecare provider's coordination concerning status and evolution of the patient's global condition takes place. RESULTS Over a 6-month period, 39 patients were included in the DREPADOM home hospitalization protocol, 3 of which were included multiple times for a total of 42 inclusions. Mean age was 40 years old [\u00b19], sex ratio was 14/25 (male/female), ER vs early discharge ratio was 21/22, and mean homecare follow-up was 3 days (\u00b11) for both, patients arriving from the ER and early discharge patients. Throughout the third wave of the pandemic, when hospital saturation was a major concern, patients with PRESEV scores 5 \u2264 11 were also offered DREPADOM. Three patients were hospitalized (7%): one for an ACS, who was included during the 3 rd wave of the pandemic with a PRESEV score of 8; one for pyelonephritis unrelated to the VOC; and one for difficulties with venous access. No death was reported. PERSPECTIVES Preliminary satisfaction surveys show a great enthusiasm for DREPADOM, partly due to the high standard of care received, but also due to the shorter length of hospitalization. In fact, median hospital stay for VOC is 4 [3-7] days (Bartolucci, 2016) whereas median homecare follow-up was 3 [1-6] days.
