    "abstract_text": "Despite the remarkable pace of characterizing the genomics of pediatric acute leukemias, the integration of real-time sequencing results into clinical practice has lagged. With increased availability of molecularly-targeted therapies, the promise of matching genetic lesions in patients' leukemia cells to treatment has not yet been fully realized. We established the first pediatric leukemia clinical genomics consortium in the United States, known as the Leukemia Precision-based Therapy (LEAP) Consortium, which includes 13 major pediatric cancer institutions. We hypothesized that it is feasible to identify and match, in real-time, actionable alterations with a targeted therapy for pediatric patients with relapsed, refractory or high-risk leukemias or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Using a combination of a DNA-based next-generation sequencing panel and RNA-based gene fusion testing, followed by data review by our multidisciplinary molecular tumor board, we are conducting a clinical trial to test this hypothesis. To date, we have enrolled and reviewed data from 143 patients stratified by disease status: Cohort 1, patients with relapsed or refractory leukemias (n=93), and Cohort 2, patients with de novo high-risk leukemias or MDS (n=50). A matched targeted therapy (MTT) recommendation has been made for 72% (n=103) of patients, tiered based on the level of evidence linking the mutation to potential activity of targeted therapy in the context of each patient's disease (Tier 1: 11%, Tier 2: 4%, Tier 3: 41%, Tier 4: 6%, Tier 5: 10%). Of the 44 patients in Cohort 1 with clinical follow-up data, 5 (11%) had alterations in therapy made based upon sequencing results and MTT recommendation. These include the use of the MEK inhibitor trametinib for RAS mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n=2), dasatinib for B-ALL and T-ALL with NUP214-ABL1 translocations (n=2) and ponatinib for B-ALL with an ABL1 T315I mutation (n=1). In addition, this genomic data refined diagnosis and supported additional germline assessment in a subset of patients. In parallel to the genomic sequencing, we are conducting high-throughput drug sensitivity (HTS) assays to study in vitro anti-leukemia effects of a panel of up to 120 targeted inhibitors in the context of leukemia-associated genetic alterations. Of the initial 106 accrued patients, 40 (38%) had adequate amounts of blood or bone marrow for in vitro drug testing. All samples were tested in the inhibitor panel assay, and 65% of the samples yielded interpretable results. Inhibitor screening data was compiled for all 12 patients with genetic alterations resulting in Tier 1, 2 or 3 MTT recommendations. This subset of patients had leukemias with two distinct molecular profiles: 1) oncogenic RAS signaling pathway mutations or 2) oncogenic tyrosine kinase alterations. Our molecular tumor board recommended trametinib for the first group of patients and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), specific to the mutation, for the second group of patients. In vitro HTS data analysis demonstrated dose-response sensitivity of leukemia cells with RAS pathway mutations to trametinib, many of which had half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) less than 50 nM. Similarly, leukemia cells from patients with FLT3 , ABL1 or KIT mutations generally showed dose-responses to relevant TKIs with low IC 50 s. Overall, HTS data were concordant with MTT recommendations informed by the sequencing results. This first in the US multi-institutional prospective leukemia genomics trial brings state-of-the-art clinical genetic testing, assessment of prognostic biomarkers, selection of patients for germline testing, and targeted therapeutic treatment recommendations to children and young adults with high-risk, relapsed or refractory leukemias or MDS. Our collaboration provides a unique opportunity to perform sophisticated patient-specific in vitro drug testing assays to impact MTT discovery efforts, which we plan to validate in vivo using patient-derived xenograft models where feasible. We believe that a model like the LEAP Consortium has the potential to transform precision medicine approaches for children with high-risk leukemias and to inform future genomics-guided therapeutic trials and drug discovery efforts.
