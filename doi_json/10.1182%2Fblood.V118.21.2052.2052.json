    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2052 T cell engineering against tumor antigens aims at ameliorating current immunotherapeutic strategies. To date, however, the suboptimal persistence of the transferred cells represents a serious limitation of this approach. The most appropriate T cell subset to be infused should ensure optimal in vivo persistence and yet appropriate anti-tumor activity. Here we report that culturing highly purified nai\u0308ve T (T N ) cells with beads conjugated to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, allows the retrieval of a novel post-mitotic CD45RA + CD62L + CCR7 + T cell population, which requires IL-7 and IL-15 for expansion and maintenance. This population is highly proliferative and sensitive to RV and LV transduction, expresses low levels of \u03b3IFN and cytotoxic molecules and is best defined as IL-7R\u03b1 + CXCR4 + c-kit + CCR5 \u2212 HLA-DR \u2212 PD-1 \u2212 . When infused in immunodeficient mice, genetically manipulated and in vitro expanded T N proved superior engraftment and longer persistence than transduced central memory (T CM ) cells, and xenoreactivity comparable to that of unmanipulated lymphocytes. Engineered T N , but not T CM , maintained engraftment and xenoreactivity in serial transplantation experiments, indicating unique self-renewal abilities. Given the great potentials of this novel T N -derived cell population for immune-gene therapy, we further characterized it by molecular profiling. The gene expression signature is typical of antigen-experienced lymphocytes and classifies these cells between naturally occurring T N and T CM lymphocytes. Because of this and of the self-renewal abilities displayed in vivo , we termed them as precursor to T CM (T preCM ). We next sought to identify the natural counterpart of this T preCM population in healthy donors, exploiting some of the markers present in the T preCM signature, such as CD95 which is expressed by all memory T subsets but not by T N, and we selected the pp65 protein of cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a model antigen. CMV persistent infection induces a T-cell response that is maintained throughout life, indicating that a self-renewing memory T cells are generated. We studied the phenotype of CMV pp65-specific CD8 + T cells in seropositive donors and identified antigen-specific CD45RA + CD62L + . Among CD45RA + CD62L + cells CMV-specific cells were enriched for CD45RO dim and CD95 + lymphocytes, which represent bona fide T preCM . To functionally characterize natural T preCM , we sorted CD45RA + CD62L + cells according to their CD95 expression and challenged them with increasing doses anti-CD3 antibody, with or without a costimulatory signal. We found that among CD45RA + CD62L + cells, only CD95 + lymphocytes were responsive to TCR-triggering alone, while CD95 \u2212 cells required costimulation to proliferate. In conclusion, we identified a novel memory T cell subset, and identified conditions able to gene-modify and expand these memory lymphocytes while preserving their functional characteristics. Exploitation of these concepts might improve cancer adoptive immunotherapy. Disclosures: Bonini: MolMed: Consultancy."
