    "abstract_text": "Abstract 69 Bosutinib (BOS) is an oral, dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor. In the randomized, phase 3 BELA trial, BOS 500 mg/d demonstrated clinical activity in newly diagnosed (\u22646 mo) chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP CML) and manageable toxicity distinct from that of imatinib (IM) 400 mg/d. This analysis of the BELA trial investigated reduction in Bcr-Abl/Abl ratio at Months 3, 6, and 9 as early predictors of long-term outcomes. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment arms. Dose escalation to 600 mg/d occurred in 6% of patients (pts) on BOS and 18% of pts on IM. The most common reason for BOS discontinuation was toxicity (24% vs 7% on IM), and for IM was progressive disease (13% vs 4% on BOS). Data included a minimum follow-up of 24 mo. In the intent-to-treat population, the rate of major molecular response (MMR; Bcr-Abl/Abl ratio \u22640.1% on International Scale [IS]) was higher at all time points for BOS versus IM, with a significantly shorter median time to MMR for BOS (48 wks) versus IM (73 wks; P <0.001). Among pts with molecular assessment at each time point, the rate of Bcr-Abl/Abl ratio \u226410% on the IS was significantly higher with BOS versus IM at Month 3 (86% vs 65%; P <0.001), Month 6 (94% vs 82%; P <0.001), and Month 9 (97% vs 90%; P = 0.01); a similar trend was observed for pts with Bcr-Abl/Abl ratio \u22641% at each time point ( Table ). In both arms, a Bcr-Abl/Abl ratio \u226410% versus >10% at Months 3, 6, and 9 was predictive of significantly higher cumulative rates of MMR and CCyR by both 12 mo and 24 mo ( Table  ). The rates of MMR by 12 and 24 mo were generally highest among pts with a Bcr-Abl/Abl ratio \u22641% at Month 3, 6, and 9 in both arms. A similar trend was generally observed for on-treatment event-free survival (EFS; included death, transformation to accelerated/blast phase, increased white blood cell count without complete hematologic response [CHR], or loss of CHR or CCyR) and overall survival (OS) at 24 mo ( Table  ). In the BOS arm, Kaplan-Meier estimates at 24 mo were significantly higher with a Bcr-Abl/Abl ratio \u226410% versus >10% for EFS at Months 3, 6, and 9, and for OS at Months 3 and 9. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier estimates of EFS and OS at 24 mo were significantly higher for pts with Bcr-Abl/Abl ratio \u226410% versus >10% at Months 6 and 9 in the IM arm. Within each treatment arm, estimated rates of EFS and OS at 24 mo generally appeared similar for pts with reduction of Bcr-Abl/Abl ratio \u22641% versus \u226410% at early time points. In summary, a Bcr-Abl/Abl ratio \u226410% versus >10% at Months 3, 6, and 9 was associated with higher rates of MMR and CCyR by later time points in both arms. A lower Bcr-Abl ratio was also predictive of EFS after 24 mo of follow-up except for IM at Month 3, and of OS except for IM at Month 3 and BOS at Month 6. However, because of the very limited number of EFS and OS events and the relatively few pts with a Bcr-Abl/Abl ratio >10% (particularly in the BOS arm at Months 6 [n = 12] and 9 [n = 6]), longer follow-up in the BELA trial is needed to fully characterize the predictive properties of early reductions in Bcr-Abl/Abl ratio on long-term EFS and OS.  .
