    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Classical Dyskeratosis Congenita (DKC) is a systemic disorder characterized mainly by mucocutaneous features and bone marrow failure. DKC is caused by mutations affecting proper telomere maintenance leading to premature telomere shortening. Clinically, assessment of telomere length (TL) is being used for screening and diagnosis of DKC. Previous studies showed that androgen derivatives (AD) such as danazol or oxymetholone can improve blood counts and reduce transfusion frequency in patients with DKC. Reports from in vitro studies suggest that AD can increase the expression of telomerase and elongate telomeres reversing at least partially the mutation-related haploinsufficiency of the telomerase complex. However, whether telomere elongation can be observed in vivo is still controversial. Patients with DKC have an increased risk of developing solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Malignant transformation occurs mostly by chromosomal instability mediated by critical short telomeres and not via clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) and eventual selection for MDS-related somatic mutations. The question whether increased telomerase activity by AD increases the risk for additional MDS-related mutations is unclear. In our study, we aimed to investigate TL and MDS-related somatic mutations in DKC patients undergoing treatment with AD. Methods and Patients: 5 patients enrolled in the Aachen Telomeropathy Registry (ATR) that underwent AD treatment were included in the analysis. All patients had molecularly confirmed DKC (4 patients having mutations in TERC, 1 patient in TERT). TERC mutated patients received danazol treatment (mean dosage 625 mg per day ) while the patient with TERT mutation was treated with low dose oxymetholone (0.22mg/kg) per day. Patients were at a median age of 43.1 (range from 21.7 to 53.8) years. Median duration of treatment with AD was 14 months (3 to 29 mo) and is actually ongoing in all patients treated with danazol. Follow-up for blood counts and TL length assessment was carried out after median 14 months after treatment start with AD. TL assessment and blood counts of the patient receiving oxymetholone was carried out at the end of AD treatment after 29 months. All patients underwent next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis using custom NGS-panel including frequent genes implicated in MDS development. Quality parameters of the NGS analysis were satisfactory (Q30>85%) and 95% of the expected area was covered at minimum 300x. To minimize risk of detecting sequencing errors, a threshold of 10 (absolute) and 5% (relative) variant allele frequency (VAF) was chosen. TL assessment of peripheral blood granulocytes and lymphocytes was carried out by Flow-FISH and all results are given in kb. Results: Analysis of the peripheral blood counts revealed a significant increase in platelets counts from mean 56/nl \u00b150 S.D. before treatment to 88/nl \u00b149 (p=0.03) during treatment. Similar results were observed for leukocyte counts increasing significantly from 3.83/\u00b5l\u00b11.86 to 4.70/\u00b5l\u00b12.88 (p=0.04). Hemoglobin counts showed a non-significant increase from 8.9 g/dl \u00b12.6 to 10.2 g/dl \u00b12.9 (p=0.13, all student paired t-test). Focusing on TL, lymphocyte TL increased significantly from 4.32kb\u00b10.47 to 5.13kb \u00b10.57 (p=0.001). TL in the granulocyte subpopulation increased from 4.73kb\u00b10.33 before treatment start to 6.10kb\u00b10.50 under treatment (p=0.026). Calculated median increase in TL per months for lymphocytes and granulocytes was 0.092 kb (0.019 to 0.223 kb) and 0.166 kb (0.019kb to 0.513kb). Finally, NGS analysis for possible MDS-related mutations did not reveal any mutations before and under AD treatment. Conclusions: Based on our data in this genetically homogenous cohort of 5 patients with mutations in the telomerease genes TERC and TERT and short TL, AD significantly improve blood counts and elongate telomeres in granulocytes and lymphocytes. No MDS-related somatic mutations were observed during telomerase activation with AD. Pending longer follow up, treatment with AD seems to represent an efficient and safe therapy for patients with TERT or TERC mutations. Whether AD persistently elongate telomeres in DKC patients and how much this is dependent on the underlying DKC-related mutation requires further investigation.
