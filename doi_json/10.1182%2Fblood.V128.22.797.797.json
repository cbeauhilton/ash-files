    "abstract_text": "High Mobility Group AT Hook 2 (HMGA2) is a non-histone chromatin protein that regulates gene transcription and controls cell proliferation, survival and self-renewal of stem cells. HMGA2 is expressed at a low level in normal adult hematopoietic progenitors but is highly expressed in hematopoietic progenitors of patients with Myelofibrosis (MF). However, the contribution of HMGA2 to the pathogenesis of MF remains unknown. MF is the deadliest form of myeloprolifearative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by deposition of fibrous tissues in the bone marrow, increased megakaryopoiesis, ineffective erythropoiesis and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Median survival of patients with MF is less than 6 years. The JAK2V617F mutation has been found in 50-60% patients with MF. However, it is not clear whether JAK2V617F mutation alone is sufficient to cause MF. Interestingly, up-regulation of HMGA2 expression has been found in association with the JAK2V617F mutation in a significant percentage of patients with MF. To understand the role of JAK2V617F mutation in the pathogenesis of MPN, we previously generated a conditional Jak2V617F knock-in mouse. We observed that expression of heterozygous Jak2V617F in mouse hematopoietic compartments is sufficient to induce a polycythemia vera (PV)-like MPN. Recently, we have shown that deletion of EZH2 promotes the development of MF in Jak2V617F knock-in mice and EZH2 deletion increases the expression of HMGA2 in hematopoietic progenitors of EZH2-deleted Jak2V617F mice. To directly assess the effects of concomitant expression of HMGA2 and heterozygous Jak2V617F in mice hematopoietic compartments, we expressed control vector or HMGA2 in wild type and heterozygous Jak2V617F knock-in mice BM by lentiviral transduction and performed bone marrow transplantation into lethally irradiated C57BL/6 recipient mice. Whereas recipients of vector-transduced Jak2V617F knock-in BM cells exhibited a PV-like MPN characterized by increased red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelets in their peripheral blood, recipients of HMGA2-transduced Jak2V617F knock-in BM showed reduced hemoglobin and hematocrit parameters compared with recipients of vector-expressing Jak2V617F BM cells. Interestingly, peripheral blood neutrophil and platelet counts were further increased in transplanted animals receiving HMGA2-transduced Jak2V617F BM cells. Expression of HMGA2 also resulted in significantly larger spleen size in the transplanted animals receiving HMGA2-expressing Jak2V617F BM cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed significant increase in megakaryocytic precursors (CD41 + ) but decrease in erythroid precursors (CD71 + /Ter119 + ) in the BM and spleens of transplanted animals receiving HMGA2-expressing Jak2V617F BM compared with control vector-expressing Jak2V617F BM. Furthermore, the frequency of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (LSK; Lin - Sca-1 + c-kit + ) was significantly increased in recipients of HMGA2-transduced Jak2V617F knock-in BM compared with control vector-transduced Jak2V617F knock-in BM or HMGA2-transduced wild type BM. Histopathologic analysis revealed extensive fibrosis in the BM and spleens from recipients of HMGA2-expressing Jak2V617F mice at 32 weeks after transplantation while BM and spleens from recipients of vector-transduced Jak2V617F knock-in BM or HMGA2-transduced wild type BM showed very little or no fibrosis at this age. Together, these data suggest that expression of HMGA2 promotes megakaryopoiesis and accelerates the development of MF in mice expressing Jak2V617F. To gain insights into the mechanisms by which expression of HMGA2 accelerates the development of MF in Jak2V617F mice, we performed RNA-sequencing analysis on purified LSK (Lin - Sca-1 + c-kit + ) cells. Gene set enrichment and pathway analyses revealed that the genes related to chemokine, TGF-\u03b2, MAP Kinase, PI3 kinase-Akt, mTOR and WNT signaling pathways were up-regulated in HMGA2-expressing Jak2V617F mice LSK compared with vector-expressing Jak2V617F LSK cells. We also found that HMGA2 directly binds to the promoter regions of some of these target genes and regulate their expression. Further studies will validate the targets of HMGA2 and determine their contribution in MF mediated by Jak2V617F. In conclusion, our studies show that expression of HMGA2 cooperates with Jak2V617F in the development of MF. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
