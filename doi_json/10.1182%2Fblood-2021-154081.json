    "abstract_text": "Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy, marked by uncontrolled clonal expansion of plasma cells. MM genome is complex and heterogeneous, with a high frequency of structural variants (SVs) and copy-number abnormalities (CNAs). Single-cell sequencing technologies offer advantages over traditional bulk methods in cancer genomics research for evaluating cellular heterogeneity and investigating evolution of cellular subpopulations within the tumor. Thus, there is an impetus to translate the growing understanding of the genomic landscape of MM into dissecting the tumor heterogeneity using scRNA-seq. So far, there are no reported studies systematically comparing tumor and immune populations differences between MM NON-progressors (NPs) and RAPID-progressor (RPs) and investigating how clonal plasma cells contribute to progression in a large cohort. In addition, the bone marrow microenvironment plays an important role in the evolution of premalignant MM and MM progression. A previous study of single-cell transcriptomics analysis of Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and MM tumor microenvironment (TME) revealed that natural killer (NK) cell abundance is frequently increased in the early stages and associated with altered chemokine receptor expression. This study shed the light on the role of immune cells on disease progression from asymptomatic MGUS to symptomatic MM. However to date, how immune cells influence disease progression within symptomatic MM is still unclear. Here, we subjected 344 CD138-negative Bone Marrow Mononuclear cells (BMMC) samples to scRNA-seq. To control for the first line therapy, 272 patients were treated with RVD and Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and were stratified into 3 groups based on progression: 200 NON-progressors (NPs) (PFS> 5 years), 7 Intermediate Progressors (IPs, PFS 2-4 years) and 38 RAPID-progressors (RPs) (PFS<=18 months). In addition, there are 72 subjects treated with RVD but without ASCT, including 34 NPs, 2 IPs and 36 RPs. From MMRF CoMMpass study (NCT01454297), we also have whole exome sequencing (WES) and bulk RNA-seq from CD138-positive fraction of BMMC samples. Our preliminary analysis of scRNA-seq of 6 samples treated by the same first-line therapies (RVD but without ASCT) revealed that plasma cells (PCs) from two patients (MMRF2550 and MMRF2562) with chromosome 13q deletion clustered together, whereas PCs from a patient (MMRF2187) with t(8;14) Myc translocation formed a distinct cluster. Interestingly, PCs from a patient (MMRF2271) with both chromosome 13q deletion and t(8;14) formed another independent cluster. These observations highlight the important role of genetic drivers in transcriptome profiles of plasma cells. In addition, we further investigated how progression features correlate with the immune microenvironment and identified differentially expressed genes between NK cells from RPs versus those from NPs, which could potentially serve as MM progression markers. Interestingly, several cytotoxicity genes are significantly upregulated in FPs, such as GZMB and KLRB1 (log Fold Change=1.44, and 8.41 respectively). Overall, our preliminary results provide a small glimpse of the interconnected nature of driver genetic alterations and progression features in MM tumor and TME. This study will provide a sufficiently broad, deep, and diverse vast dataset for accurately characterizing MM at single-cell resolution to help interrogate how genetic alterations and disease progression interplay MM tumor and TME. We hope this study could identify novel candidate targets for therapeutic approaches, and ultimately stratify patients by risk of progression for early intervention in the clinic.
