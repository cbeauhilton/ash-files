The biologic relationship between these two morphologically and immunophenotypically distinct neoplasms in same patients remains unclear, though recent data suggest a possible \u201ctransdifferentiation\u201d from follicular lymphoma (FL) to HS. Patients and Methods We investigate the clonal relationship in two cases of B-cell lymphoma with subsequent HS, using immunohistochemical stains, PCR-based immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene rearrangement/sequencing analysis and interphase FISH study on formalin fixed, paraffin-imbedded tissue sections. Results Case 1 is a 62-year-old female with splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) who developed HS in a groin lymph node one year after the diagnosis of SMZL. PCR/sequence analysis of IGH gene showed a monoclonal rearrangement carrying identical DNA sequences of PCR products from the spleen with SMZL and the lymph node with HS. Case 2 is a 61-year-old female with a remote history of FL who developed supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and multiple other infiltrating foci. A supraclavicular lymph node biopsy demonstrated HS. PCR analysis detected a monoclonal rearrangement of the IGH gene and interphase FISH analysis revealed IGH/BCL-2 fusion, a genetic hallmark for FL. Although negative for other B-cell associated antigen markers, HSs show partial retention of primary neoplasms B-cell lymphomas' immunoprofiles, including expression of Oct-2 in both cases, and expression of bcl-6 and enhanced expression of bcl-2 in case 2. Conclusion The data provide a genotypic evidence of common clonal origin between mature B-cell lymphoma and subsequent HS in the same patients, suggesting \u201ctransdifferentiation\u201d to HS could occur in other small B-cell lymphoma, in addition to FL. The transformed HSs might have incompletely inherited primary neoplasms' expression signatures by retaining B-cell lymphomas' characteristic immunoprofile to certain extent. The exact mechanism governing the conversion of mature B-cell lymphoma to HS is largely a mystery and remains to be elucidated by more scientific studies, though a few pathways have been proposed for the process, including transdifferentiation, dedifferentiation and common progenitor models.
