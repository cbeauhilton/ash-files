    "abstract_text": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a cytoplasmic organelle required for proper protein folding and sorting. When protein load exceeds the capacity of the ER, the accumulation of the misfolded proteins triggers a quality control response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Recent studies have revealed that increased activation of the UPR is one of the hallmarks of hematological malignancies. In addition, excess UPR is associated with pro-fibrotic conditions, i.e., pulmonary fibrosis, renal fibrosis and kidney fibrosis.Lysyl-oxidase (LOX) is an enzyme that regulates the crosslinking of extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen, and enhances a fibrotic phenotype. Recent studies revealed that the genes of LOX family members are upregulated in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Furthermore, megakaryocytes and platelets derived from MPN patients had increased LOX protein concentrations in comparison with healthy subjects. It is also reported that the UPR is one of the important regulators of LOX. Based on this knowledge, we speculated that the enhanced UPR might be involved in the elevation of LOX in JAK2 V617F harboring MPN and may contribute to the development of myelofibrosis. To study this hypothesis, we initially confirmed that JAK2 V617F-positive cell lines(HEL and SET-2) show enhanced activation of UPR, including phosphorylation of eIF2-alpha, nuclear localization of ATF6 and XBP1s and upregulation of glucose response protein 78 (GRP78). We also confirmed the presence of elevated levels of LOX in these cells. Treatment of the cells with a chemical chaperone, namely, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), suppressed UPR and decreased expression of LOX, suggesting that UPR is responsible for elevation of LOX in MPN cells. To analyze whether JAK2 V617F is responsible for the enhanced UPR and expression of LOX in MPN cells, we treated the cells with JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Unexpectedly, ruxolitinib did not block UPR nor expression of LOX. Previously, we reported that metformin, which is a member of the biguanide family, inhibited growth of MPN cells through activation of AMPK and PP2A (Kawashima et al. Exp.Hematol, 2016). Furthermore, a number of studies demonstrated that metformin suppressed UPR in several cancer cells through activation of AMPK. Therefore, we investigated whether metformin could block UPR and LOX levels in these cells. As expected, metformin reduced the phosphorylation levels of eIF2alpha and nuclear localization of XBP1 and ATF6. Expression of GRP78 was also blocked by metformin. These results clearly indicated that metformin suppressed UPR in MPN cells. Metformin also blocked the activation of the molecules required for proteins synthesis including p70S6kinase, mTOR and 4E-PB1. These results indicated that suggested that metformin blocked aberrant UPR through inhibition of enhanced protein synthesis. Importantly, we also confirmed that LOX expression was also suppressed by metformin in MPN cells.Our observations indicated that the UPR is enhanced in MPN cells irrespective of JAK2 V617F, and metformin could block this process leading to suppression of LOX levels. Combination of ruxolitinib with metformin might be a new and attractive method to suppress myelofibrosis in MPN. Disclosures Kirito: Novartis Pharma KK: Honoraria."
