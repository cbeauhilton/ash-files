    "abstract_text": "Background: Von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder affecting women and produces significant menorrhagia as its main symptom. Though combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP\u2019s) are the most common treatment modality for menorrhagia, randomized controlled studies to assess their efficacy are lacking. Data on response rates to different doses and combinations of estrogens and progestins in OCP\u2019s, and data on response rates to combined therapy of OCP\u2019s with desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) and/or aminocaproic acid (Amicar) are sparse. Methods: The patient population consisted of 80 patients aged 9\u201319 years, who were primary referrals to a combined Hematology/Gynecology clinic for evaluation of menorrhagia. A retrospective chart review was done on these patients following an IRB approval. Collected data included age of menarche, onset of menorrhagia, follow up duration, severity of menorrhagia including PBAC score, co-morbidities, family history of bleeding or clotting disorders, blood group, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and VW Ag level. VWD was defined as ristocetin cofactor activity <57 % (57 \u2013149%). Response to treatment modalities as assessed by the gynecologist was subjective (menstrual bleeding lasting less than 7 days and decrease in the number of menstrual products used per day) in most patients and by the PBAC score (Pictorial blood loss assessment chart) in a few. Results: Of the 80 patients with menorrhagia, 26 patients (32.5%) had ristocetin co factor activity <57 % with normal multimers and were diagnosed with VWD type 1. Mean age in years (\u00b1SD) at menarche and at diagnosis of menorrhagia were 11.31\u00b11.54 and 12.65\u00b11.77 respectively. Mean follow up period was 1.73 yrs (range 0.2 \u2013 3 yrs). O blood type was present in 73.1% (19/26) patients. Family history of menorrhagia and easy bruising was present in 34.6% (9/26). Table 1: Treatment and Response Rate  Treatment* . N=26 .

Ten patients (38.5%) remained on the same treatment. Table 2: Treatment combinations  Treatment Combinations . N=26 . .

A third of the patients achieved bleeding control with OCP\u2019s alone whereas the rest required a combination of OCP\u2019s with either DDAVP, Amicar, or both. A prospective study is needed to confirm these findings and to determine standards of treatment in patients with menorrhagia and Von Willebrand\u2019s disease.",
