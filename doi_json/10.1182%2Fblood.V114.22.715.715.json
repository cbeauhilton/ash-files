    "abstract_text": "Abstract 715 We previously reported interim results (Blood-ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts-2007 110: abstract 2324) of a prospective study evaluating dose-dense and dose-intense variants of ABVD regimen. Seventy pts with a newly diagnosis of cHL were enrolled from 06/04 to 03/08. Pts had intermediate-(INT) or advanced-stage (ADV) according to GHLSG criteria ( Tab.1 ). INT (n=24) were treated with dd ABVD, and ADV (n=46) with dd-di ABVD. Briefly, the strategy concepts of treatment were: 6 cycles of chemotherapy; the inter-cycle period shortened from 28 to 21 days; drugs delivered at day 1 and 11 of each cycle; In the dd-di-ABVD, adriamycin was escalated from 50 to 70 mg/m2 in cycles 1-4; primary G-CSF was given; the therapy was driven by interim-FDG-PET; radiotherapy was planned with very stringent criteria.

In 9 events pts were hospitalized to treat infections. Reversible palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia was seen in 27 pts.The onset was between the 2 nd and 4 th cycle and disappeared within one month from the end of therapy (Tx). Three reversible events mimicking acute abdominal emergency needed a brief hospitalisation for support therapy. A suspect drug's alveolitis was seen in 3 events. This condition appeared between the 5 th /6 th cycles and was successfully treated with support. In all cases pts continued the Tx with a minimum delay and a moderate dose reduction of bleomycin. One case of sporadic reversible epileptogenic syndrome was seen in a 16-yr old girl. Early(1-yr) and late(4-yr) cardiac toxicity was studied in 70 and 25 pts, respectively: there was no evidence of relevant cardiac dysfunction. DOSE INTENSITY STUDY: Median duration of chemotherapy (planned 18-wk) was 19.7-wk (range 17.6-21.7). Planned and delivered RDIs of drugs were significantly higher as compared with the most used regimens ( Tab.2 ). Tab 2 Schedules and dose-density and intensity of Adriamycin . ADR mg/m2 .

No statistical differences was noted between INT and ADV subsets. At the end of 6 th cycle 69/70 pts (98,6%) were in CR. Three out of 69 complete responders (4.3%) had a biopsy-proven relapse: a 33-yr old man ( IV E A), a 27-yr old girl (IIB) and 29-yr old girl ( IV XE B). Relapsed occurred at 3, 10 and 14 months from the end of Tx, respectively. SURVIVAL: Data with a minimum follow up of 12-mo from the end of Tx were available in all 70 pts. Fig.1 shows the EFS rates of 24 INT-stage (95.8%), and 46 ADV-stage (91.3%) pts, respectively. A comparative analysis ( Fig.2 ) between this series of 70 pts treated with dd ABVD or dd-di ABVD and the last 70 historical INT-stage (n=25) and ADV-stage (N=45) pts treated with baseline ABVD shows a statistically significant increment in EFS rate in pts receiving intensified ABVDs (93.0% vs 73.2% p=0.0041).

Based on these results a randomised comparison of intensified versus baseline ABVD seems justified. Tab 3 Response and Survival .
