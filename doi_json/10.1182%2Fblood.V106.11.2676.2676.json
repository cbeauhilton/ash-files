    "abstract_text": "We have analyzed the results in terms of response rate and peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) mobilization ability of two cisplatin-based chemotherapy salvage regimens [DHAP (cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 iv day 1, ara-c 4 g/m 2 iv day 2 and dexamethasone 40 mg po days 1-4) and ESHAP (etoposide 40 mg/m 2 iv days 1\u20134, cisplatin 25 mg/m 2 iv days 1\u20134, ara-c 2 g/m 2 iv day 5 and methilprednisolone 500 mg iv days 1\u20135)] in a group of 110 patients with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (HL) in first or subsequent relapses. There were 70 males and 40 females with a median age at diagnosis of 29 years (range, 10 \u2013 79). Sixty seven patients (64%) presented with advanced stage, 54% of them had B symptoms, 32% bulky mediastinal mass and 38%, extranodal disease. Disease status at the time of administration of the salvage protocol was primary refractory disease (PRD) (n = 16, 17%), first relapse (n = 65, 69%), second or subsequent relapse (n = 10, 11%) and relapse after a prior autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) (n = 3, 3%). Twenty-seven patients (26%) received the DHAP protocol and the remaining 78 (74%), the ESHAP protocol. Median time from diagnosis to the salvage therapy was 15 (range, 1 \u2013 249) mo. In patients treated after a first relapse, the median duration of the first complete remission (CR) was 7 (range, 1 \u2013 77) mo, with 18% of the patients relapsing after a long first CR (> 12 mo). Median number of cycles administered per patient was 2 (range, 1 \u2013 3) with a median time interval between cycles of 28 (range, 21 \u2013 76) days. PBPCs were collected after the second and the third cycle of chemotherapy in 35% and 49% of the patients respectively and was successful (> 2.0 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg) in 97% of them. Grade 3\u20134 hematological toxicity was seen in 20% of the cycles with severe neutropenia (< 0.5 x 10 9 /l granulocytes) and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 10 9 /l platelets) developing in 26% and 7% of the cycles, respectively. The most frequent grade 3\u20134 extra-hematological toxicity was nausea/vomiting (30%). Procedure related mortality was 2%. Response rate (RR) was 78% [CR: 39%, partial remission (PR): 39%] with significant differences between patients treated for PRD [RR of 41% (CR: 12%, PR: 29%)] and those treated for disease relapse [RR of 86% (CR: 44%, PR: 42%)] (p = 0.005). Cisplatin-based regimens are a useful therapeutical strategy in the treatment of refractory or relapsed HL due to a high overall RR and an adequate PBPC mobilization ability. Results in terms of disease response are significantly worse in patients treated for PRD."
