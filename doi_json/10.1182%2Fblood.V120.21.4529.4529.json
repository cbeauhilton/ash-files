    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4529 Objective: To observe the efficacy and safety of imatinib mesylate (IM) accompany with allogeneic transplantation for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Methods: During the period from January 2003 to August 2011,we retrospectively observed 95 patients with CML receiving IM for a minimum of 4 months before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients with advanced CML received IM from 3 month after transplantation for 12 months. Results: Among 95 enrolled patients (CML-CP 76, CML-AP 10, CML-BP 9), types of transplantation: sib-matched HSCT 64, unrelated-HSCT 19, haplo-HSCT 12. For the whole patients, 7 year overall survival (OS) is 80.5%, and disease free survival (DFS) is 74.5%. Complete hematologic response (CHR) is 93.6%, complete cytogenetic response (CCR) is 84.5%, major cytogenetic response (MCR) is 60.3% at 7 year. For CML-CP1, OS is 83.2% and CML-AP/BC is 33.3% (P<0.05). Compared patients of advanced CML achieving CP2 after IM and with no CP2,the former has better results of CCR or MCR, OS and PFS (P<0.05). The total treatment related mortality (TRM) is 16.8%. Cox multivariate regression analysis of prognostic factors indicates that status of CML and severe acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD III-\u2021W) retain independent predictive value. No increase in rates of serious adverse events was observed with continuous use of IM for up to 7 years. Conclusions: For chronic myeloid leukemia, combining with imatinib mesylate and allogeneic transplantation is a good strategy, with favorable long-term follow-up results and acceptable TRM, especially for the patients with advanced CML.
