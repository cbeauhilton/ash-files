    "abstract_text": "Background The immune modulatory effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on T cells resulted in an unexpected low incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Our previous studies demonstrated that G-CSF mobilization influenced the distribution and clonality of TRGV and TRDV repertoire (T cell receptors of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells), and signi\ufb01cant positive correlation was observed between the invariable clonality of TRDV1 gene repertoire after G-CSF mobilization and low incidence of GVHD in recipients (P=0.015, OR=0.047) (Li Xuan et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2011). Regulatory \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (\u03b3\u03b4 Tregs), which express Foxp3 and primarily belong to CD27 + CD25 high phenotype, are a novel subset of cells with immunosuppressive function (Xiaoyan Li et al. Journal of Immunology 2012). However, whether G-CSF could influence the expression of \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of G-CSF mobilization on the expression of \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs. Methods The immunophenotyping of \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 20 donors before and after G-CSF mobilization, using flow cytometry. Results Compared with that before mobilization, the proportions of V\u03b41 and CD25 + subsets were significantly increased (P=0.012, P=0.032), whereas the V\u03b42 proportion was significantly decreased after G-CSF mobilization (P=0.002). The proportions of total \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, CD27 + and Foxp3 + subsets were similar between the two groups (P=0.133, P=0.110, P=0.780, respectively). In addition, there was a significant increase in the proportions of Foxp3 + V\u03b41 and CD25 + Foxp3 + subsets (P=0.038, P=0.013), and a significant decrease in the proportions of CD27 + V\u03b42 and CD25 + V\u03b42 subsets after G-CSF mobilization (P=0.013, P=0.022). The proportions of CD27 + \u03b3\u03b4 T, CD25 + \u03b3\u03b4 T, Foxp3 + \u03b3\u03b4 T, CD25 + CD27 + , CD27 + Foxp3 + , CD27 + V\u03b41, CD25 + V\u03b41 and Foxp3 + V\u03b42 subsets were similar before and after G-CSF mobilization (P=0.422, P=0.342, P=0.724, P=0.070, P=0.503, P=0.053, P=0.386 and P=0.097, respectively). We then compared the Foxp3, CD27 and CD25 phenotypes in total \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, V\u03b41 and V\u03b42 subsets. We observed a significant increase in the proportion of CD27 + Foxp3 + V\u03b41 subsets after G-CSF mobilization (P=0.036). The proportion of CD27 + Foxp3 + \u03b3\u03b4 T and CD27 + Foxp3 + V\u03b42 subsets before mobilization were similar to that after mobilization (P=0.539, P=0.507). The proportion of CD25 + Foxp3 + \u03b3\u03b4 T, CD25 + Foxp3 + V\u03b41, CD25 + Foxp3 + V\u03b42, CD25 + CD27 + \u03b3\u03b4T, CD25 + CD27 + V\u03b41 and CD25 + CD27 + V\u03b42 subsets were also similar between the two groups (P=0.249, P=0.539, P=0.507, P=0.934, P=0.209 and P=0.061, respectively). Conclusions G-CSF mobilization significantly increased the proportions of V\u03b41 subsets, including Foxp3 + V\u03b41 and CD27 + Foxp3 + V\u03b41 subsets, whereas decreased the V\u03b42 proportion.
