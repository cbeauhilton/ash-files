    "abstract_text": "Background Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 mutations ( IDH1/2 MT ) occur in up to 20% of MDS, MDS/MPN overlap and (secondary) AML, 80% of secondary glioma and 20% of cholangiocarcinoma patients. IDH1/2 MT confer an improved prognosis in glioma and cholangiocarcinoma patients, but not AML patients, compared with IDH1/2 wild-type ( IDH1/2 WT )counterparts (Fig 1). IDH1/2 MT enzymes produce D -2-hydroxyglutarate ( D -2HG)at the expense of NADPH, an important cellular antioxidant. IDH1/2 MT are ancestral in ~30% of AML/MDS cases, rendering them attractive therapeutic targets because all cancer cells carry IDH1/2 MT and this limits the chance of therapy resistance. Inhibitors of IDH1/2 MT were recently developed and are currently in clinical trials. IDH1 MT inhibitors protect IDH1 MT solid tumor cells against irradiation and cisplatin. Thus, IDH1/2 MT inhibitors and cytotoxic drugs should not be used together in patients with IDH1/2 MT solid tumors. It remains unknown whether IDH1/2 MT inhibitors can be safely used as adjuvants to cytotoxic drugs in patients with myeloid malignancies. Methods Primary IDH1/2 MT and IDH1/2 WT AML and MDS cells (n=20) were cultured and treated with D- 2HG, the IDH1/2 MT inhibitors, the antioxidant N -acetyl cysteine (NAC) and/or irradiation, cisplatin, 5-azacytidine, cytarabine, daunorubicin or decitabine. We determined cell death, ROS levels and DNA double strand break numbers. In addition, maximal cellular IDH1/2 and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity was determined. Results After treatment with irradiation, cisplatin, 5-azacytidine, cytarabine, daunorubicin or decitabine, we did not observe more reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA double strand breaks or cell death in IDH1/2 MT primary AML/MDS cells versus IDH1/2 WT primary AML/MDS cells (Fig 2). Accordingly, IDH1/2 MT inhibitors or the ROS scavenger NAC had no effect on these aforementioned outcomes in IDH1/2 MT primary AML/MDS cells. These results contrast the situation in glioma and carcinoma cells, where increased ROS levels, DNA double strand breaks and cell death levels were observed in irradiated or cisplatin-treated IDH1/2 MT cancer cells, and where IDH1/2 MT inhibitors or NAC reverse these effects (Fig 1). IDH1/2 MT were associated with a striking reduction in the IDH1/2-mediated NADPH production capacity in primary AML cells and solid tumor cells. However, IDH1/2 are not important NADPH providers in primary AML/MDS cells and the contribution of G6PD to the total NADPH production pool is ~4 times larger than IDH1/2 (Fig 3). In contrast, IDH1/2 provide 65% of all NADPH in glioma. Administration of D -2HG, the metabolite produced by IDH1/2 MT enzymes, decreased IDH1/2-mediated NADPH production capacity in primary AML/MDS cells and solid tumor cells and is a likely cause of the decreased IDH1/2-mediated NADPH production in IDH1/2 MT cells. Discussion Our results offer an explanation for the relatively longer survival of patients with IDH1/2 MT glioma and cholangiocarcinoma and the unchanged survival of patients with IDH1/2 MT AML or MDS. A plausible mechanism is the strong production of the antioxidant NAPDH by IDH1/2 in solid tumor, but not AML/MDS cells. These data imply that concomitant use of IDH1/2 MT inhibitors and cytotoxic therapy in patients with IDH1/2 MT solid tumors may limit therapy efficacy. However, in patients with IDH1/2 MT AML or MDS, IDH1/2 MT inhibitors can probably be used safely as adjuvants to AML/MDS standard of care 5-azacytidine, cytarabine, daunorubicin and/or decitabine therapies, or whole-body irradiation in the context of bone marrow transplantations. These data are crucial for the rational design of clinical trials with IDH1/2 MT inhibitors and complete understanding of their outcomes.
