    "abstract_text": "Background: While currently-diagnosable hematological cancer is a potent VTE risk factor (RR range =12\u201332), whether undiagnosable hematological cancer is a risk factor is uncertain. Objective: To estimate the hazard of subsequent hematological cancer among incident VTE patients with no apparent active hematological cancer within \u00b1 3 months of the VTE event. Methods: In a population-based cohort study, we followed Olmsted County, MN residents with incident VTE over the 27-year period, 1973\u20131999, and previously matched Olmsted County residents without VTE, who survived with no apparent active hematological cancer within \u00b1 3 months of the VTE event or a routine medical visit date, respectively, forward in time through their complete medical records in the community for hematological cancer. Data were abstracted on baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, type and stage of hematological cancer, and any prior solid tumor treatments. For cases and controls, hematological cancer-free survival from the event date was estimated by the Kaplan Meier method, and the homogeneity of survival curves was examined by the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for covariates. Results: 1860 VTE cases (56% females) and 1890 controls (53% females) were followed for 16,497 and 15,320 person-years, respectively, conditional on surviving 3-months free of hematological cancer. 43 VTE cases and 24 controls developed hematological cancer at a median of 63.5 months (range 0.7 \u2013 334 months). The median age for cases was 63.2 years compared to 67.8 years for the controls (p<0.001). Hematological cancer types included non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (n=19), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=11), acute myeloid leukemia (n=1), multiple myeloma (n=9), myeloproliferative disorders (n=10), and myelodysplastic syndromes (n=14). Case status was not univariately associated with subsequent hematologic cancer (HR=1.42; 95% CI: 0.85, 2.39; p=0.18). After adjusting for age, also associated with cancer, case status was significantly associated with hematological cancer (HR=1.90; 95% CI: 1.13, 3.20; p=0.015). Conclusions: Incident VTE patients have nearly a two-fold increased risk of subsequent hematological cancer. We hypothesize that VTE can be the initial manifestation of an occult hematological cancer clone."
