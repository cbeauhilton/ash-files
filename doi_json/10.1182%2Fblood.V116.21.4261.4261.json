    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4261 Osteoporosis in thalassemia is extremely common and preventive approaches are required to avoid serious complications in adults. Vitamin D deficiency, which contributes to suboptimal bone mineralization, is frequently observed in thalassemia despite routine prescription for supplementation with 400\u2013800 IU vitamin D per day. Screening for vitamin D status was conducted in 71 patients with thalassemia, of which 52 were transfusion-dependent and 19 were transfusion-independent (including 11 patients with hemoglobin H or H Constant Spring disease). Baseline assessment of plasma 25-OH vitamin D revealed 57 (80.3%) patients were either deficient (80 ng/mL) during the course of the study. These results show that vitamin D deficiency remains widespread despite daily low-dose supplementation. Non-transfused patients are at even greater risk of vitamin D deficiency, which may reflect less attention to nutrition in this group compared to the transfusion-dependent patients. We have found that supervised high-dose oral ergocalciferol supplementation is simple, safe, non-invasive and predictable method to improve vitamin D status in thalassemia.
