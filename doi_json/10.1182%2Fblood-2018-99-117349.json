    "abstract_text": "Introduction - The nuclear export protein exportin 1 (XPO1) is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers including multiple myeloma (MM). Selinexor is a first-in-class Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compound that binds and inactivates XPO1. Selinexor forces nuclear retention and reactivation of cell cycle regulators such as p53, IkB, and Rb. Pomalidomide/dexamethasone (Pd) is approved in relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM)with an overall response rate (ORR) of 30% and progression-free survival (PFS) rate of <4 months in patients (pts) having received a prior proteasome inhibitor (PI) and IMiD. Strategies to improve the ORR and PFS are needed. In murine MM models, the combination of selinexor with IMiDs shows synergistic anti-MM activity and good tolerability. Methods - Pts with RRMM who received \u2265 2 prior therapies including lenalidomide (len) and a PI were enrolled. Selinexor was evaluated in 2 different dosing schedules of once-weekly (QW, 60 or 80 mg) or twice-weekly (BIW, 60 or 80 mg), with pomalidomide (pom)3 or 4 mg PO daily, and dexamethasone (dex) 20 mg BIW or 40 mg QW. The primary objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety, and preliminary efficacy of the combination of selinexor, pomalidomide, and low dose dex (SPd) in pts with RRMM. Results - As of July 20 th 2018, 34 pts (16 male / 18 female) have been enrolled. The median age is 61 years and patients received a median of 4 (range, 2 - 9) prior treatment regimens. Thirty-two patients were IMiD refractory (21 len, 11 pom/len). Six dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed: G3 fatigue (60 mg BIW, pom 4 mg), G3 febrile neutropenia (FN) (60 mg BIW, pom 3 mg), G3 FN and G4 neutropenia (80 mg QW, pom 4), G3 thrombocytopenia (80 mg QW, pom 3 mg) and 4 missed doses in Cycle 1 due to symptomatic hyponatremia (80 mg BIW, pom 4 mg). Enrollment on selinexor 80 mg QW, pom 3 mg is ongoing. Common SPd treatment related adverse events included (all grades, grades 3/4): neutropenia (62%, 56%), thrombocytopenia (59%, 32%), anemia (53%, 29%), anorexia (56%, 0%), fatigue (50%, 9%), nausea (47%, 0% ). Thirty pts were evaluable for response, which is outlined in Table 1 . Median PFS is 10.3 months with a median follow up of 9.4 months. Conclusions - Enrollment is ongoing to evaluate once weekly selinexor in combination with Pd , (SPd). This all-oral SPd combination has clinical activity with an ORR 55% in pom-naive pts with heavily pretreated MM compared to previously published data of 30% ORR for Pd alone. Similarly, the PFS on SPd is 10.3 months vs. <4 months for Pd alone. No unexpected adverse events were noted. Phase 1 dose escalation of the combination of SPd is ongoing to define the optimal RP2D.
