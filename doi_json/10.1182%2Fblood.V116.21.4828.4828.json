    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4828 Purpose: Stanford V is an abbreviated combined modality approach for the treatment of advanced stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). This regimen was developed with the aim of shortening the duration of chemotherapy, limiting the radiotherapy (RT) to a modified involved field and thereby potentially reducing short and long term toxicity while maintaining or improving cure rates. Specifically the chemotherapy regimen has significantly lower cumulative doses of adriamycin, bleomycin and alkylating agents compared to other standard regimens such as ABVD or escalated BEACOPP. We have previously reported excellent outcomes with this regimen with a freedom from progression (FFP) of 89% and overall survival (OS) of 96% (Horning, S.J., et al., J Clin Oncol 2002, 20:630-7). The purpose of this study was to determine the outcome of patients (pts) treated with secondary therapy after failing Stanford V. Methods: Pts with advanced stage HL who had either refractory disease or had relapsed after primary therapy with Stanford V, were retrospectively identified from the HL database. We analyzed this group of patients for risk factors, salvage therapy, and treatment outcome. Results: Between May 1989 and March 2003, 167 pts were treated on protocol. At a median follow-up of 12.8 years the outcomes are excellent with a 10-year FFP and OS of 87% and 93%, respectively. Therapy failed in 19 pts (11%) of which 16 relapsed and 3 did not complete the intended treatment (disease progression n=2, and muscle pain and hyponatremia n=1). The median age of pts who failed therapy was 31 years (range 21 \u2013 58) with a median time to progression of 5.1 months (range 0.2 \u2013 41.4). 11 pts relapsed at 0 to 12 months from completion of therapy and 8 pts relapsed at > 12 months. At initial diagnosis 5 had stage I/II disease with bulky mediastinum, 5 stage III and 9 stage IV disease. The International Prognostic Score (IPS) at initial diagnosis was 0\u20131 (n=4), 2\u20133 (n=10) and 4\u20137 (n=5). 13/19 (68%) pts relapsed outside the RT field, 2 infield, 3 both infield and outside and 1 unknown. 7/19 pts in whom therapy failed had bulky disease and of these 5 failed outside the RT field. Relapse was detected clinically in 12 pts, and on surveillance positron emission tomography scan performed every 3 to 6 months in 5 pts who were asymptomatic (2 pts unknown). 14/19 (74%) pts received secondary therapy with a platinum-containing regimen (ICE or DHAP) with an overall response rate (ORR) of 91% (complete response [CR] n=1, partial response [PR] n=9, progressive disease [PD] n=1, unknown response n=3), followed by an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. 5 pts were treated with non-transplant regimens consisting of chemotherapy with MOPP/ABV + RT (n=2), ChlVPP (n=1), oral cyclophosphamide (n=1) and procarbazine/alkeran/adriamycin/etoposide (n=1), with an ORR of 80% (CR n=4). Reasons for non-transplant therapy were neuropathy (n=1), pt preference (n=1), liver disease (n=1), and unknown (n=2). 11 of the 19 pts in whom Stanford V failed died (disease progression n=3, second malignancy n=2, graft failure n=1, infection n=1, liver failure n=1, cardiac arrest n=1, suicide n=1 and unknown n=1). At a median follow-up of 8 years, the disease-specific survival (DSS), FFP and OS for pts with refractory or relapsed disease after Stanford V was 84%, 63% and 42%, respectively. Outcome of pts who relapsed within a year was worse than pts who relapsed > 1 year with an OS of 36% versus 50%, respectively. There was no difference in FFP for these groups, 64% versus 63%, respectively. Conclusions: The outcome of pts with advanced HL is excellent with the Stanford V regimen. For the 11% of pts in whom front line therapy fails, secondary therapy is effective with a DSS of > 80%. The majority of pts (84%) failed at distant sites suggesting that more aggressive upfront chemotherapy may have been beneficial in these pts. Future efforts will aim at identifying this subset upfront. Pts who relapse within a year have a worse outcome despite salvage and for this subgroup, newer therapies are warranted.
