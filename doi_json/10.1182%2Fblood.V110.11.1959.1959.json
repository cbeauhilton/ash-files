    "abstract_text": "Current recommendations for patients with CML ( Baccarani M, et al. Blood  2006 ; 108 : 1809 \u201320 ) advocate regular treatment response monitoring, including evaluation of: cytogenetic response (CyR) at least every 6 months until complete CyR is achieved, then every 12 months; molecular response (MolR) every 3 months; mutational analysis in cases of failure/suboptimal response. Yet, few data exist on monitoring in current clinical practice. A survey of CML physicians in the US/Europe suggests practices in some CML management areas are not in line with recommendations ( Kantarjian H, et al. Cancer  2007 ; 109 : 1365 \u201375 ). UNIC is a cross-sectional study, with retrospective chart review of currently treated CML or Ph+ALL patients in Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and UK. Patients were recruited September 2006-March 2007. The study aimed to estimate the proportion of patients ever treated with imatinib and those who experienced imatinib resistance and/or intolerance (primary objectives). Here, we focus on data collected on patterns of disease monitoring (a secondary objective) in CML/Ph+ALL patients. A patient was defined as imatinib resistant if reported as such by the physician in the medical chart. Case Report Forms (CRFs) were completed for 1716 patients. CRFs were analyzable for 1551 CML and 48 Ph+ALL patients. Of the CML patients, 98% were in chronic phase; 2% were in advanced phases. Of the 1493 (96%) CML and 46 (96%) Ph+ALL patients who received imatinib, 241 (16%) CML and 6 (13%) Ph+ALL patients were reported as resistant. Patterns of cytogenetic, molecular and mutational testing are shown in the tables. In the last 12 months, 31% of CML patients had not had a cytogenetic analysis and 10% had not had a PCR analysis to assess MolR. Of imatinib-resistant patients, 57% CML and 50% Ph+ALL patients had not been assessed for mutations.  Examination . CML . Ph+ALL .
