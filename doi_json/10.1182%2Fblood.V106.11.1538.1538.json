    "abstract_text": "Hyperdiploid MM (H-MM), characterized by recurrent trisomies constitute about 50% of MM, yet very little is known about its pathogenesis and oncogenic mechanisms. Studies in leukemia and solid tumors have shown gene dosage effect of aneuploidy on gene expression. To determine the possible gene dosage effect and deregulated cellular program in H-MM we undertook a gene expression study of CD138-enriched plasma-cell RNA from 53 hyperdiploid and 37 non-hyperdiploid MM (NH-MM) patients using the Affymetrix U133A chip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Gene expression data was analyzed using GeneSpring 7 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Genes differentially expressed between H-MM and NH-MM were obtained by t-test (p<0.01). The majority of the differentially expressed genes (57%) were under-expressed in H-MM. Genes located on the commonly trisomic chromosomes were mostly (but not always) over-expressed in H-MM and constitute 76% of over-expressed genes. Chromosome 1 contained the most differentially expressed genes (17%) followed by chromosome 12 (9%), and 19 (8%). To examine the relationship of gene copy number to gene expression, we examined the expression of genes on chromosomes 9 and 15 in subjects with 2 copies (15 normal control and 20 NH-MM) and 3 copies (12 H-MM) of each chromosome as detected by interphase FISH. We then derived a ratio of the mean expression of each gene on these chromosomes between patients with 3 copies and 2 copies of the chromosome. If a simple relationship exists between gene expression and gene copy number, one would expect the ratio of expression of most genes on these two chromosomes to be about 1.5 in H-MM compared to NH-MM. However, many genes have ratios either higher than 2 or lower than 0.5. Furthermore, when the heterogeneity of cells with underlying trisomies is taken into consideration by correcting the ratio for the number of cells with trisomies, the actual ratio is always lower than the expected ratio. When the expression of genes on a chromosome was compressed to a median value, this value was always higher in the trisomic chromosomes for H-MM compared to NH-MM. The data suggests that although gene dosage influence gene expression, the relationship is complex and some genes are more gene dosage dependent than others. Amongst the differentially expressed genes with known function, 33% are involved in mRNA translation/protein synthesis. Of note, 37 of the top 100 differentially expressed genes are involved in these processes. In particular, 60 ribosomal protein (RP) genes are significantly (p<0.05) upregulated in H-MM. This signature in H-MM is not associated with increase proliferation as measured by PCLI. This predominant signature suggests that deregulated protein synthesis may be important for the biology of H-MM. Many of these RPs are involved in the synthesis of product of oncogenic pathways (e.g. MYC, NF-KB pathways) and may mediate the growth and survival of tumor cells. It is therefore possible that these tumor cells may be sensitive to the disruption of mRNA translation/protein synthesis. Targeting the mTOR pathway with rapamycin may therefore be useful for treatment of H-MM."
