    "abstract_text": "Developmental intermediates of human natural killer (NK) cells are found within secondary lymphoid tissue (SLT), and five distinct stages of these intermediates have been identified. While it is well documented that developing NK cells are reliant on interleukin (IL)-15 as a survival factor, it is likely that additional cytokines and growth factors are required for complete NK cell differentiation. Microarray transcriptional profiling of purified stage 1\u20134 cells from human tonsil and stage 4 and 5 cells from peripheral blood (PB) identified a developmental window of interleukin-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression restricted to stages 2 and 3. We confirmed this finding by quantitative RT-PCR, and analysis of IL-1R1 surface protein expression revealed that, on average, 81% of stage 3 immature NK cells are IL-1R1(+), whereas the majority of cells from stages 1, 2, and 4 are IL-1R1(\u2212). When cultured in vitro with IL-1\u03b2, a physiologic ligand for IL-1R1, cells from all four stages died within 48 hours, consistent with an absolute requirement for IL-15 as a survival factor. However, the combination of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-15 led to a significant and reproducible 4.64\u00b1\u22120.68\u2013fold increase in stage 3 cell number over that seen with IL-15 alone ( p < 0.0005). This phenomenon was completely restricted to stage 3 immature NK cells, and is attributed to increased proliferation. The effects of IL-1\u03b2 were abrogated by a molar excess of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), a physiologic competitor for IL-1R1 binding. Collectively, our data indicate that IL-1R1 expression fluctuates dramatically during NK cell development, and that unique responses of IL-1R1(+) stage 3 cells to IL-1\u03b2 and IL-15 govern the expansion of these immature NK cells. Our findings support a model in which IL-1\u03b2 promotes stage 3 proliferation and survival in vivo, driving stage 3 cells to be the most prevalent NK cell intermediates within SLT."
