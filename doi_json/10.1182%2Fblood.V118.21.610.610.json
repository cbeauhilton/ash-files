    "abstract_text": "Abstract 610 Myelodysplatic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis. Patients develop peripheral blood cytopenias; however, the bone marrow shows increased proliferation and apoptosis. In addition to bone marrow apoptosis, a failure of differentiation contributes to reduced terminally differentiated blood cells. A significant proportion of patients with MDS will develop anemia that are refractory to treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) and must rely on transfusions as supportive care. The use of blood transfusions as supportive care is associated with iron overload and significant morbidity. Therefore, alternative therapies to treat anemia in MDS patients are needed. Members of the TGF\u03b2 super family of signaling molecules have been implicated in erythropoiesis and represent alternative, EPO-independent targets for the treatment of anemia. ACE-536 is a soluble receptor fusion protein consisting of a modified Activin Receptor Type IIB extracellular domain linked to a human Fc domain. ACE-536 acts as a ligand trap to modulate the activity of TGF\u03b2 ligands and promote erythroid differentiation in an EPO independent manner. Subcutaneous administration of ACE-536 to C57BL/6 mice resulted in significant increases in hematocrit, hemoglobin and red blood cells compared to vehicle treated controls within four days. These effects were observed with concurrent treatment of an EPO neutralizing antibody, indicating that EPO is not directly responsible for the initial RBC response of ACE-536. BFU-E or CFU-E colony formation assays from bone marrow or spleen of mice 48 hours after ACE-536 were normal, indicating no effect on the erythroid progenitor population. Differentiation profiling of bone marrow and splenic erythroblasts by FACS analysis following 72 hours after RAP-536 (murine version of ACE-536) treatment revealed a decrease in basophilic erythroblasts and an increase in late stage poly-, ortho-chromatophilic and reticulocytes in bone marrow and spleen compared to vehicle treated mice. The data demonstrate that while EPO treatment increases proliferation of erythroid progenitors, ACE-536 promotes maturation of terminally differentiating erythroblasts. The efficacy of ACE-536 has been demonstrated in various animal models of acute and chronic anemia. In this study we investigated the effect of ACE-536 on anemia in mouse model of MDS. The NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) transgenic mouse carries a common translocation found in MDS patients. NHD13 mice develop anemia, neutropenia and lymphopenia at 4\u20137 months of age, with normal or hypercellular bone marrow. Starting at 4 months of age, mice were treated with RAP-536 (murine homolog of ACE-536) at 10 mg/kg or vehicle control twice per week for 8 months. Wild-type littermate controls were also dosed on the same schedule. As expected, at study baseline (mice 4 months of age), NHD13 mice had reduced RBC, Hb and HCT compared to wild-type littermates. The progression of anemia over the study period was reduced by treatment with RAP-536 compared to vehicle (HCT: \u22128.3% v. \u221222%, RBC: \u221213% v. \u221230%). Based on blood smear analyses, there was no indication of increased leukemic cells with ACE-536 treatment. Our data demonstrate that RAP-536 can increase hematology parameters through enhancing maturation of terminally differentiated red blood cells and can serve as a therapeutic molecule for the treatment of anemia. As anemia contributes significantly to the morbidity of patients with MDS, a mouse model was used to test the therapeutic efficacy of ACE-536 in this disease. We have shown that systemic administration of RAP-536 to MDS mice promotes increases in red blood cell mass without enhanced progression to AML. Therefore ACE-536 may represent a novel treatment for anemia associated with MDS, particularly in patients that are refractory to EPO therapy. Disclosures: Suragani: Acceleron Pharma Inc: Employment.
