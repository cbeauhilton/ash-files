    "abstract_text": "Background: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis leading to cytopenias, including anemia and thrombocytopenia. KER-050, a modified activin receptor type IIA inhibitor, is designed to target transforming growth factor-\u03b2 ligands, including activin A. In preclinical studies, KER-050 promoted the maturation of progenitors across the full spectrum of erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis and elicited bone anabolic effects. In a Phase 1 study in healthy participants, KER-050 treatment resulted in robust and sustained increases in reticulocytes (RETs), hemoglobin (HGB), and platelets. Increases in the bone formation marker bone specific alkaline phosphatase were also observed. Here we report results of an ongoing Phase 2 study to evaluate whether KER-050 provides therapeutic benefit in MDS patients with anemia. Aims: Evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of ascending doses of KER-050 in participants with MDS in an open-label, 2-part Phase 2 study. Methods: IPSS-R very low-to-intermediate risk MDS patients (both RS+ and non-RS) with anemia (HGB <10g/dL or requiring RBC transfusions) are enrolled. In Part 1, ascending dose cohorts receive KER-050 subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 4 doses starting at 0.75mg/kg until a recommended Part 2 dose is determined. Part 2 dose expansion will begin following Part 1, with treatment extended to 2 years. Safety endpoints include incidence of adverse events (AEs); erythroid efficacy endpoints (\u22658 weeks duration) include rates of transfusion independence (TI) in transfused participants, reduction in RBC transfusions by \u22654 units or \u226550% reduction in high transfusion burden participants (HTB) and HGB increase \u22651.5g/dL in non-transfused (NT) and low transfusion burden (LTB) participants. Results are reported for efficacy-evaluable participants in cohorts 1 and 2 of Part 1 dose escalation, defined as having \u22658 weeks of HGB and transfusion data. Results: At data cut-off (July 10, 2021) with median follow-up of 140 days (range 1 to 169 days), 17 participants had received \u22651 dose of KER-050 across 3 dose levels: 0.75 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg. Baseline characteristics are described in Table 1. No related serious AEs, dose-limiting toxicities, or dose modifications were reported. One participant developed grade 2 maculopapular rash after the first dose which was considered treatment related, resolved and did not recur with subsequent doses. No other related AEs were reported. Two discontinued study drug prior to end of treatment: 1 due to participant decision, 1 due to death unrelated to study drug. None developed high risk MDS or AML. In 10 efficacy-evaluable participants, overall erythroid response rate was 60% (n=6/10). 33% (n=1/3) NT participants had a HGB increase of \u22651.5g/dL sustained \u2265 8 weeks. 5 of 7 transfused participants (71%) (n=1/2 LTB and n=4/5 HTB; n=2/3 non-RS and n=3/4 RS+) had erythroid responses sustained \u22658 weeks (range 8-20 weeks, ongoing) and 57% (n=4/7) achieved TI (Figure 1, Panel A). Maximum increase from baseline in RETs observed in transfused responders (TR) (n=5) was 24.6 x10 9 /L (mean), range 10.5- 41.6 x10 9 /L from day 1-29 with increases in RETs seen after each dose (Panel B). Maximum reduction in serum ferritin in TR was 40.4% (mean), range 10-66%, and maximum increase in soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) was 52.8% (mean), range 29.8-116.4%. Increases in platelets were observed in TR (Panel C). Mean baseline platelet count for TR was 234 x10 9 /L (range 104-401 x10 9 /L), and maximum increase from baseline was 130 x10 9 /L (mean), range 32-235 x10 9 /L. No participants required dose reduction due to thrombocytosis. Summary : Erythroid responses have been observed in RS+ and non-RS MDS patients including reduction in transfusion burden at the initial dose levels. Observed increases in RETs and sTfR and observed decreases in ferritin suggest that KER-050 treatment is potentially associated with increased erythropoiesis. Increases in platelets have been observed in TR. These data support the potential of KER-050 as a treatment for multilineage cytopenias in MDS by potentially targeting multiple stages of hematopoiesis. As of data cut-off, KER-050 has been well tolerated. Dose escalation is ongoing in this Phase 2 study of anemic patients with MDS; data from planned cohorts from Part 1 will be presented. Part 2 dose expansion phase is expected to initiate prior to the meeting.
