    "abstract_text": "Haplo-identical HSCT may resolve the shortage of sufficient available HLA-matched donors for treatment of end-stage blood-cancer patients with a HSCT. Yet, current techniques do not allow for such procedure as presence of T-cells will cause severe GvHD and absence of T-cells (i.e. naked Haplo) will lead to occurrence of opportunistic infections. Kiadis Pharma is developing ATIR, a personalized T-cell immunotherapy based on a donor lymphocyte preparation selectively depleted of host alloreactive T-cells, through use of photo-dynamic therapy. Briefly, recipient-reactive T-cells from donor-origin are activated in a unidirectional mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Thereafter the cells are treated with the proprietary compound TH9402 which is selectively retained in activated T-cells. Subsequent light-exposure eliminates the activated recipient-reactive T-cells but preserves the other T-cells. In a dose-finding phase I/II clinical study (CR-GVH-001), the product was shown to enable safe and efficacious haplo-identical HSCT with doses up to 5x10 6 viable T-cells/kg. Currently, a subsequent phase II clinical study (CR-AIR-007) on ATIR (2x10 6 /kg) is ongoing. Figure 1 View large Download slide Figure 1 View large Download slide  Using recently developed analytical methods, the ATIR product is extensively characterized showing that recipient-alloreactive T-cells were selectively depleted from the product while retaining reactivity against unrelated 3 rd party antigens and general potent T-cells. In the figure above, a typical example of the ATIR responsiveness profile is shown when analyzing the cells in a CFSE-dilution based proliferation assay. Clearly, the cells in ATIR no longer proliferate to recipient antigens, but do still propagate when co-incubated with unrelated 3 rd party cells or the poly-clonal T-cell stimulus anti-CD3/28. Generally, almost all recipient-responsiveness is depleted, while 3 rd party responsiveness remains unchanged. The ATIR proliferation profile is corroborated by examination of interferon-\u03b3 production at day 5: the original donor cells produced a median of 775 pg/ml IFN-\u03b3 when stimulated with recipient cells, whereas ATIR produced a median of 1 pg/ml IFN-\u03b3. Also less IFN-\u03b3 was produced by ATIR when co-incubated with 3 rd party cells: 127 pg/ml vs 1106 pg/ml. However, ATIR produced more IFN-\u03b3 when polyclonally stimulated with PMA+ionomycin: 4075 pg/ml vs 2580 pg/ml.

Thereby, ATIR will provide mature immune cells that offer immune protection without eliciting severe GvHD. The in vitro characterization data are supported by clinical data showing absence of TRM during 5-year follow-up (CR-GVH-001) over a broad dose range and no occurrence of grade 2 or higher GvHD in the ongoing clinical study (CR-AIR-007). Together, these data show that using ATIR as an adjunctive medication, haplo-identical HSCT can be safe and efficacious. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
