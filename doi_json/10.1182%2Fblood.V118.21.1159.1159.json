    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1159 Background. Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune disorder where platelets are activated by antibodies to a complex of platelet factor 4 antigen and heparin (PF4/H), leading to thrombocytopenia (HIT) and, potentially, thrombosis (HITT). Documentation of anti-PF4/H antibodies in addition to the appropriate clinical findings is essential for making a diagnosis of HIT. In the post-cardiac bypass surgery setting, however, the frequency of elevated anti-PF4/H antibodies is high, whereas the frequency of clinical HIT or HITT is relatively uncommon. Several studies have shown that the presence of anti-PF4/H antibodies may be associated with an increased frequency of adverse outcomes, even in the absence of clinical HIT. The primary objective of this study was to determine the relationship between a positive PF4/H antibody in the postoperative setting with adverse thromboembolic events occurring up to 3 months after cardiac surgery. Methods. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery who were not going to be treated with chronic anticoagulation postoperatively were eligible for this multi-center prospective cohort study. Data were collected daily during hospitalization, and then at 30 and 90 days after surgery using a structured interview format with a standardized questionnaire that included all thrombotic as well as hemorrhagic events, platelet counts, and utilization of antithrombotics in the postoperative setting. The primary outcome variable was a composite endpoint comprising arterial and venous thrombotic events and other miscellaneous events compatible with HIT, as well as death attributable to an event compatible with HIT. Citrated plasma was collected at baseline, pre-discharge (\u223c4\u20135 days after surgery), and the 30 day follow-up visit, processed, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for testing. Laboratory analyses included an anti-PF4/H antibody ELISA (GTI, Waukesha, WI) on all samples, a high-heparin confirmatory test on samples with an OD reading >0.40, and a serotonin release assay (SRA) on all postoperative samples with an OD reading >0.40. A sample size of 800 patients was estimated in order to detect a 3% difference in thromboembolic events assuming a 2 to 10-fold increase risk attributable to seropositivity. Chi-squared testing was used to test the relationship between the primary outcome and postoperative anti-PF4/H levels. Results. Informed consent was obtained from 1030 eligible patients between August 2006 and May 2009, and laboratory and follow-up data were analyzable for 1016 patients. Thirty-day antibody data were available for 888 patients, and fully complete laboratory and 90-day follow-up data were available for 815 patients. The average age was 62 \u00b1 12 years, and 73% of participants were male. A total of 769 patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and 237 underwent valve repair or replacement. During the entire study period, there were 17 (1.7%) deaths, 46 thromboembolic events in 44 patients (4.3%), and 25 hemorrhagic events in 24 patients (2.4%). Using an OD cutoff of 0.40 for the ELISA, 339 patients (33.4%) were positive for anti-PF4/H antibodies at the time of discharge, and 630 patients (62%) were positive by day 30. There was no correlation between seropositivity for anti-PF4/H antibodies at the day of discharge or at day 30 and the primary outcome (p=0.47 and 0.73, respectively). Incorporating the high-heparin confirmatory step did not improve the relationship between positive antibody results and the primary outcome. Using a higher cut-off value for the anti-PF4/H antibody ELISA of 1.0 decreased the number of patients with positive results (96 patients at the time of discharge [9.4%] and 221 patients at the 30-day follow-up visit [21.8%]), but this did not improve the relationship between antibody positivity at the day of discharge or day 30 and the primary clinical endpoint, since most patients with the primary endpoint had an ELISA OD below 1.0 (75 th percentile of 0.90; 90 th percentile of 1.22). Similarly, using the SRA did not identify a relationship between assay results and outcome. Conclusions. The presence of anti-PF4/H antibodies in the postoperative setting following cardiac bypass surgery is not associated with an increased risk for thromboembolic complications. Positive anti-PF4/H results in this clinical setting should be interpreted with caution and only in the context of clinical suspicion for HIT.
