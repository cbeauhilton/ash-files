    "abstract_text": "CD4 + CD25+ regulatory T-cells (Treg) are increased in the peripheral blood of cancer patients. It remains unclear whether this is due to redistribution or active proliferation. The latter would require the up-regulation of telomerase activity, whose regulation also remains unknown for Treg. We therefore isolated Treg and the respective CD4 + CD25 \u2212 control T-cell population from peripheral blood of cancer patients (n=23) and healthy age-matched controls (n=17). Analysis of their content of T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) revealed that the observed increase of Treg frequencies in peripheral blood is due to active cycling rather than to redistribution from other compartments (i.e. secondary lymphoid organs or bone-marrow), as Treg from cancer patients are characterized by a significant decrease of TREC content when compared to TREC content of Treg isolated from healthy age-matched controls. Surprisingly, despite their proven in vivo proliferation, telomere length is not further shortened in Treg from peripheral blood of cancer patients as shown by Flow-Fish, Real-Time PCR and Southern Blotting. Accodingly, telomerase activity of Treg was readily inducible in vitro by OKT3 together with IL-2. Notably, sorting of in vitro proliferating Treg using dilution of CFSE revealed a significant telomere shortening in Treg with high proliferative capacity (i.e. CFSE low fraction) under conditions of strong in vitro stimulatory growth conditions despite a high telomerase activity. Thus, under conditions of strong in vitro stimulation induction of telomerase seems to be insufficient to avoid progressive telomere shortening. In contrast, in actively proliferating peripheral blood Treg from patients with epithelial malignancies induction of telomerase activity is likely to compensate for further telomere erosion.",
