    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been used to treat some of hematological malignancies and inherited or acquired non-malignant disorders. Unfortunately, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred approximately 15% in transplant recipients and impacts on the outcome of allogeneic HSCT. At present, no effective modality could completely prevent the GVHD from allogeneic HSCT patients. CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + regulatory T cells (T regs ) have been shown to be important in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity. However, 5% to 10% T regs could be measured in human CD4 + T cells and few Tregs would convert to conventional activated T cells because of losing FoxP3 expression or n T regs in suppression of T cell activation. It had been reported to correlate with the occurrence and severity of GVHD in some study. In order to study the potential use of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + T regs for the prevention of GVHD, we attempt to evaluate the better efficient method to increase the number of induced T reg cells ( i T regs ) in donor and stabilize the FoxP3 in i T reg cells. Using mouse as a model, the splenocytes were prepared from mouse spleen. Before having biological function, i T reg cells need to stabilize the FoxP3 protein expression. Using retinoic acid (RA, 0.1-5ng/ml) as a stabilizer of the FoxP3 protein expression can keep the i T reg cells in stable. The endogenous regulatory T cells ( n T reg ) can inhibit T cell activation, thereby affecting T cells into i T reg efficiency. We should remove the n T reg cells from the CD4 + T cells. Therefore, CD4 + T cells were isolated by negative selection, and then using the n T reg removing kit, we harvested the CD4 + CD62L + na\u00efve T cells for i T reg cell induction. For this purpose, na\u00efve CD4 + cells were harvested, and then activated with anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads in the presence of IL-2, TGF-\u03b21 and retinoic acid (RA) containing RPMI1640 medium. During the T regs induction, the activated T cells were performed under low nutrient supplement (5% FBS) for three days then refreshed the cells into the full nutrient supplement (10% FBS) for another four days. The harvested cells were analyzed by flow cytometry method with fluorescence-conjugated CD-antibodies, including CD4, CD25, CD127, CD62L and FoxP3. Currently, the removal of n T reg cells could improve the efficiency of i T reg cell formation from 15% to 70-80% under this modified culture method (Fig.1). Further improvement of human peripheral blood regulatory T cell generation efficiency is our ongoing target. Our study showed that the combination of IL-2, TGF-\u03b21 and RA in 3-day-nutrient-deprived medium could convert na\u00efve CD4 + CD62L + T cells to CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + i T reg cells and stabilize FoxP3 expression in the i T reg cells efficiently. Further, we will develop the i T reg suppression assay to clarify the biological function of i T regs in vitro . GVHD mouse model will be established by using allogeneic HSCT to verify the function of i T regs in vivo , too.
