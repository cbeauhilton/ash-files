    "abstract_text": "Mcl-1 is a Bcl-2 family-member that has been described to act anti-apoptotic in various myeloid neoplasms. We and others have recently shown that neoplastic mast cells (MC) in patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) display Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL. In the present study, we examined the effects of the Mcl-1/Bcl-2-targeting drug GX015-070 (obatoclax \u00ae ; GeminX, Montre\u0301al, Quebe\u0301c, Canada) on growth and viability of primary neoplastic MC obtained from patients with SM (n=3), the human MC leukemia cell line HMC-1, and the canine mastocytoma cell line C2. Two HMC-1 subclones, one lacking KIT D816V (HMC- 1.1) and one expressing KIT D816V (HMC-1.2) were examined. As assessed by RT-PCR and immunostaining, primary neoplastic MC as well as HMC-1 cells (both subclones) were found to express Mcl-1 mRNA and the Mcl-1 protein in a constitutive manner, but did not express significant amounts of proapoptotic Bim. Transfection of HMC-1 cells with Mcl-1-specific siRNA resulted in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis compared to cells transfected with a control siRNA. GX015-070 was found to inhibit 3 H-thymidine uptake and thus proliferation in HMC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with higher IC 50 values obtained in HMC-1.2 cells (0.5 \u03bcM) compared to HMC-1.1 cells (0.05 \u03bcM). GX015-070 also inhibited the growth and survival in the canine mastocytoma cell line C2 (IC 50 : 0.5-1 \u03bcM). Moreover, GX015-070 was found to inhibit the proliferation of primary human neoplastic MC in all SM patients tested (IC 50 : 0.05-0.1 \u03bcM). We next attempted to combine obatoclax with a modulator of Mcl-1/Bim expression in MC, in order to enhance drug effects. Since Bim is degraded via the proteasome, we applied the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Whereas GX015-07 did not modulate the production/expression of Mcl-1 or Bim in HMC-1 cells, bortezomib was found to promote the expression of Bim in our Western blot experiments. In addition, bortezomib was found to suppress 3 H-thymidine uptake in both HMC-1 subclones. Finally, bortezomib was found to cooperate with GX015-070 in producing apoptosis in HMC-1.1 cells, HMC-1.2 cells, and C2 cells. Together, our data show that the Mcl-1/Bcl-2-targeting drug GX015-070 is a potent inhibitor of in vitro growth and survival of canine and human neoplastic MC. Targeting of Mcl-1 in neoplastic MC alone or in combination with a Bim-regulator may be an interesting pharmacologic approach in advanced SM.",
