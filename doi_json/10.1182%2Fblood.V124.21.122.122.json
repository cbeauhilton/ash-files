    "abstract_text": "Background: NPM1 mutated (mut) FLT3- ITD negative acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a distinct prognostically favorable subtype of AML. Robust data is available demonstrating that monitoring therapy response using NPM1 mut-specific real time PCR is an important tool to early detect relapses and provides important information to guide therapy. Since next generation sequencing techniques have become available further gene mutations were detected that accompany NPM1 mut in AML. Of these DNMT3A mut were the most frequent and stable ones (Kr\u00f6nke et al., Blood, 2013). Aim: 1) Analyse the stability of DNMT3A mut in paired diagnostic and relapsed samples. 2) Evaluate whether monitoring of DNMT3A mut provides additional information to monitoring of NPM1 mut. Patients and Methods: Samples were selected from a cohort of 359 NPM1 mut de novo AML cases with an available DNMT3A mut status.First, toevaluate the stability of DNMT3A mut paired diagnostic and relapse samples of 103 patients were analyzed (44 males, 59 females; median age 60 years, range: 26-82 years). Median time to relapse was 11 months (range: 3-68 months). NPM1 mut status was assessed at diagnosis with a LightCycler melting curve analysis assay. Non type A mutations were further characterized by Sanger sequencing. Second, all diagnostic and follow-up samples (n=1,813) were quantified by real time PCR specific for the individual NPM1 mut. Analysis for DNMT3A mut was performed using either the 454 technology (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT) or the MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Deep DNMT3A sequencing of remission samples was performed using the 454 technology. Results: Out of 103 paired samples 61 (59.2%) carried a DNMT3A mut at diagnosis. 57/61 (93.4%) patients stably retained the mutation at relapse, in 4 (6.6%) the DNMT3A mut was lost. On the other hand 2 of 42 (4.8%) cases with DNMT3A wildtype at diagnosis gained the mutation at relapse. Thus, DNMT3A mut status was shown to be relatively stable (97/103; 94.1%) and thus qualifies as a promising target for follow-up controls. For comparison of DNMT3A mut and NPM1 mut status during follow-up 54 patients that were NPM1/DNMT3A double mutated at diagnosis were selected according to the availability of at least one sample in first remission with an NPM1 mut level <0.01%. These samples were reanalyzed by deep sequencing for the respective DNMT3A amplicons that had identified mutations at diagnosis. Two of these 54 cases (3.7%) showed morphologic relapse but NPM1 mut was negative at relapse (sensitivity of 10 -7 ). In one of these two cases at diagnosis NPM1 mut and TET2 mut were observed while at relapse IDH1 mut and RUNX1 mut were present. However, at both time points the DNMT3A mut was identified. The second case lost NPM1 mut and CEBPA mut and retained the DNMT3A mut and TET2 mut. Thus in these 2 cases the DNMT3A mut can be regarded as the common ancestor. 1 case retained the NPM1 mut at relapse but lost the DNMT3A mut. Of note, in 32/54 (59.3%) cases the DNMT3A mut persisted in the remission samples (NPM1 mut low level <0.01% or negative) with high DNMT3A mut loads (median: 20%, range: 2-59%) that was only slightly below the load at diagnosis (median: 45%, range: 38-58%). To analyze the clinical importance of these persisting DNMT3A mut survival analysis was performed. Median overall survival for patients with persisting DNMT3A mut (n=32) was 69 vs 96 months in those who lost also the DNMT3A mut in remission (n=22, p=0.053). Median event free survival was 38 vs. 96 months (p=0.031). Thus the DNMT3A mutational status in remission of NPM1 mut AML is a further important parameter for prognostication. The mechanisms underlying this observation are obscure. As NPM1 mut disappeared in remission and DNMT3A was retained and with the exception of 2 cases all others (n=18) relapsed with an NPM1 mut (even the same type as at diagnosis) two mechanisms may be discussed: 1) Persisting DNMT3A mut cells predispose by a yet unknown mechanisms to the development of a secondary NPM1 mut or 2) a residual DNMT3A mut/ NPM1 mut very low level survivor is able to overgrow the DNMT3A mut sole mutated clone in remission and cause relapse. Conclusions: 1) DNMT3A mut persist in remission of NPM1 mut AML in the majority of cases (59.2 %). 2) DNMT3A mut analysis in remission of NPM1 mut AML is an important parameter for prognostication. 3) Clones with DNMT3A mut as the sole mutation may have a normal phenotype and thus DNMT3A mut may even be regarded as premalignant mutation.
