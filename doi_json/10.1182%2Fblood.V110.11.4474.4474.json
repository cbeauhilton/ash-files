    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Rituximab plus chemotherapy has been proved to be the standard in treating advanced follicular lymphoma. However in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) the results are still controversial. Methods: In a prospective randomised trial (OSHO#39) we compared the efficacy and toxicity of MCP chemotherapy(mitoxantrone 8 mg/m 2 d 1+2, chlormabucil 3x3 mg/m 2 d 1\u20135 and prednisolone 25 mg/m 2 d q 4 weeks)versus MCP plus rituximab (375 mg/m 2 d -1) in advanced indolent lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. Here we present the results of the MCL subgroup (n=90) among the 358 randomised patients (FL, MCL, LPL). Study endpoints included overall and complete response rate (RR + CR), progression free survival (PFS), event free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicities. Results: with a median follow-up of 43 months for the MCL subgroup we can provide relatively mature data. Concerning toxicities there was no striking difference between the treatment groups. The treatment results for the MCL patients are as follows: Conclusions: Concerning all end-points R-MCP is not superior to MCP chemotherapy alone in advanced mantle cell lymphoma. Immunochemotherapy is obviously not the solution for this poor prognosis lymphoma entity. Results  . R-MCP n=44 . MCP n=46 . p-value .
