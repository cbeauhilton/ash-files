    "abstract_text": "Background: Acquired pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is an autoimmune disease in which autoaggressive T lymphocytes selectively suppress erythropoiesis, sometimes associated with clonal T cell disorders. However, little is known about the structure of the T-cell receptors (TCR) used by T lymphocytes involved in the development of acquired PRCA. Previously, a patient with granular lymphocyte-proliferative disorder with an expansion of V\u03b41+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells has been reported to be associated with cyclosporine-resistant acquired PRCA ( Handgretinger et al. NEJM  1999 ; 340 : 278 \u2013284 ). We hypothesized that autoreactive \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes might also be involved in the pathogenesis of cyclosporine-responsive PRCA, and thus examined whether the oligoclonal expansion would be detected in cyclosporine-responsive acquired PRCA patients. Methods: Five PRCA patients who achieved remission after oral cyclosporine therapy were included in this study, and informed consent was obtained before drawing blood samples. Blood mononuclear cells were stained with monoclonal antibodies specific for V\u03b41, V\u03b42 or V\u03b43, and were analyzed by flow cytometry. Clonality of the V\u03b41+ T cell subset was determined by complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) size spectratyping analysis of TCR V\u03b41-C\u03b4 PCR products. Junctional sequence was determined by DNA sequencing with an ABI377 automated DNA sequencer. Results: All five patients showed an increase of the V\u03b41+ T cell subset in circulating blood (Table 1), although the major subset of human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in healthy individuals is the V\u03b42 (data not shown). Oligoclonal expansion was detected by CDR3 size spectratyping analysis and were confirmed by sequencing of the TCRV\u03b41-C\u03b4 PCR products in all five patients (Table 2). No apparent consensus sequence among patients was observed in the CDR3 region of clonally expanded V\u03b41+ T cells. Conclusions: Oligclonally expanded V\u03b41+ T cells may be responsible for the pathogenesis of cyclosporine-responsive acquired PRCA. Biological function of these clonally expanding V\u03b41+ T cells, natural ligands of the TCRs and requirements of antigen-presenting molecules remain to be elucidated.
