    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3618 Poster Board III-554 The potential influence over cytokine activity by soluble receptors and the precise cytokine specificity they display suggests that soluble cytokine receptors may play a significant role in the response of cells to cytokine-mediated signaling. GM-CSF biology is mediated by binding to a heterodimeric receptor consisting of a major binding subunit (GMR\u03b1) and a major signaling subunit (\u03b2). GM-CSF Receptor can signal an astonishing variety of cellular functions, including protection from apoptosis, differentiation, maturation, activation and homing. GM-CSF Receptor \u03b1 (GMR\u03b1) exists in both trans-membrane (tmGMR\u03b1) and soluble isoforms (sGMR\u03b1). sGMR\u03b1 is believed to arise exclusively through alternative splicing of the GMR\u03b1 gene product which removes the exon encoding the transmembrane domain. The splicing is such that the amino terminal 317 residues of sGMR\u03b1 are homologous to the extracellular domain of tmGMR\u03b1, however, the deletion and subsequent frameshift replaces the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of tmGMR\u03b1 with a unique 16 amino acid tail on sGMR\u03b1. It has been demonstrated that normal human monocytes constitutively secrete sGMR\u03b1, and sGMR\u03b1 has been implicated in the biology of acute myeloid leukemias and the tumor-nerve interactions evoking bone cancer pain. sGMR\u03b1 has been shown to bind directly to GM-CSF. We hypothesized that recombinant sGMR\u03b1(r-sGMR\u03b1) competitively inhibits the biological properties of GM-CSF. Using a baculoviral expression system, we produced N-terminal-His-tagged r-sGMR\u03b1. We exposed the GM-CSF and IL-3 dependent myeloid cell line, Mo7e, to varying concentrations of r-sGMR\u03b1 and found that r-sGMR\u03b1 directly inhibits GM-CSF dependent cell survival and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. We found that r-sGMR\u03b1 was toxic to Mo7e cells at concentrations as low as the K d of r-sGMR\u03b1 for GM-CSF (3nM). The finding that lower concentrations of GM-CSF resulted in lower Mo7e stimulation, but not toxicity, indicated that the mechanism of r-sGMR\u03b1 toxicity was unlikely to simply be a reduction in effective GM-CSF concentration. To test whether the r-sGMR\u03b1 toxicity seen in Mo7e cells was a result of GM-CSF neutralization or a result of signaling inhibition, we demonstrated that GM-CSF neutralizing antibody is cytotoxic during GM-CSF withdrawal, but not cytotoxic in the presence of IL-3, whereas r-sGMR\u03b1 was cytotoxic under both conditions. Previous kinetic studies have demonstrated a time-dependent strengthening of the GMR\u03b1 : \u03b2 : GM-CSF complex; forming discrete \u201cloose\u201d and \u201ctight\u201d binding forms over minutes. Our studies indicate that neither pre-incubation of r-sGMR\u03b1 with GM-CSF (6 hours) nor pre-incubation of cells with GM-CSF (prior to r-sGMR\u03b1 addition) diminishes r-sGMR\u03b1's ability to inhibit GM-CSF-dependent cell survival and proliferation. We also determined that both r-sGMR\u03b1 and GM-CSF degradation is independent of the other in vitro . To determine if r-sGMR\u03b1 mediated cell death resulted from mechanisms other than GM-CSF signaling inhibition, we also tested additional myeloid cell lines that do not require exogenous cytokines for survival, including K562, (which does not express GMR\u03b1) as well as KG-1 and HL-60 cells (which both co-express GMR\u03b1 and GMRb). While r-sGMR\u03b1 does not inhibit survival or proliferation of KG-1 cells, r-sGMR\u03b1 does inhibit proliferation of both HL-60 and K562 cells, but only at concentrations tenfold higher than the K d (30nM). This inhibition was independent of GM-CSF's presence. These data indicate that soluble receptor may have biological effects beyond competition for ligand with the membrane bound receptor, and beyond the modification of GM-CSF half-life. The ability of r-sGMR\u03b1 to inhibit IL-3 dependent survival in Mo7e cells, but not K562 cells, supports the notion that r-sGMR\u03b1 may be directly inducing cytotoxicity by interacting with surface components that are likely part of the GM-CSF Receptor complex. Collectively, our data represent the first evidence demonstrating the modulation of GM-CSF signaling in human myeloid neoplasms by r-sGMR\u03b1 and further illustrates the potentially significant role of soluble receptors in the response of cells to cytokine-mediated signaling.
