    "abstract_text": "The normal range of platelet counts of peripheral blood is 150\u2013450 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Decreased platelet count results in the increased risk of bleeding. On the other hand, thrombosis formation is more prevalent in the patient of thrombocytosis. The mean platelet volume(MPV) is the mode of the measured platelet volume. There is an inverse relationship between platelet size and number. Therefore, the total platelet mass, the product of the MPV and platelet count is closely regulated. When platelets decrease in number, bone marrow megakaryocytes are stimulated by thrombopoietin, and their nucleus becomes hyperlobulated, with much greater ploidy. These stimulated megakaryocytes produce larger platelets. The platelet distribution width(PDW), is an indicator of the degree of variation in platelet size. PDW is defined as the coefficient of variation of the distribution of individual platelet volumes. So PDW is rising if the platelet destruction is increased while MPV is decreased. 48,340 patients were performed CBC test at Dong-san medical center through out the year of 2004. The platelet count below 150 \u00d7 10 9 /L were 5,501(11.4%). Below 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L of Platelet count is 2,303(41.8%). Platelet count Below than 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L is 73(1.3%), 20\u201350 \u00d7 10 9 /L is 323(5.9%), 50\u2013100 \u00d7 10 9 /L is 1,907(34.6%). Hemoglobin is 11g/dL in 50\u2013100 \u00d7 10 9 /L group and the hemoglobin is also rose in proportion to platelet count. WBC count is 10,540/L in below 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L group and WBC count is decreased in proportion to platelet count. MPV is 9.5fL in 20\u201350 \u00d7 10 9 /L group. PDW is 48.54% in below 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L and the percentage is rose in proportion to platelet. Total bilirubin is 3.08g/dL in 20\u201350 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Cause of thrombocytopenia is chronic liver disease, malignancy, infection and hematologic disease and secondary origin is more frequent than primary origin. Patients with thrombocytosis are 8,027(16.6%). The platelet count more than 600 \u00d7 10 9 /L is 1,199(14.9%), 600\u20131,000 \u00d7 10 9 /L is 1,051(13.1%), above 1,000 \u00d7 10 9 /L is 148(1.8%). The PDW is 49.2% in 600\u20131,000 \u00d7 10 9 /L group, 53% in above 1,000 \u00d7 10 9 /L group."
