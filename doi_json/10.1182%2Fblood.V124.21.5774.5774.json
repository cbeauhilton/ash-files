    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Skeletal related events (SRE) in multiple myeloma (MM) patients are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Studies assessing the anti myeloma effect of statins in conjunction with chemotherapy have shown conflicting results with regards to overall survival or disease response. To our knowledge there have been no studies evaluating the effect of statins on SRE. Here we sought to assess the relationship between statin use and the presence of SRE. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 101 patients seen at our institution between the years 2007-2012 who had a diagnosis of MM separating them in 2 groups, patients on statin therapy (n=50) and those without statin therapy (n=51). Statin use was considered if present prior to the occurrence of a SRE. SRE were defined as pathologic fractures, necessity for orthopedic intervention, radiation therapy or spinal cord compression. MM stage as per the International Staging System (ISS), as well as history of osteoporosis, malignancy, hypothyroidism, Paget's disease of the bone, alcohol abuse, smoking status, calcium-vitamin D, and bisphosphonate use were also recorded. Results: In our cohorts the prevalence of SRE was significantly lower in patients on statin medication when compared to statin naive patients, (36% vs. 58.8% respectively, p = 0.029, Fisher's exact test, Figure 1 ). No significant differences were noted between statin treated group and statin naive group in the following variable subgroups (Fisher's exact test): the history of smoking or alcohol abuse, the documented diagnosis of osteoporosis, coexistent malignancy, hypothyroidism, or Paget's disease of the bone, and the use of other medications including bisphosphonates or calcium - vitamin D supplementation. There were no significant differences in distribution of cancer staging (according to ISS) when we compared between statin use status (chi-square test for trend). Conclusion: The use of statins was associated with a decrease in the prevalence of SRE in patients with MM. This was found independent of disease stage, history of osteoporosis or second malignancy, and bisphosphonate use.
