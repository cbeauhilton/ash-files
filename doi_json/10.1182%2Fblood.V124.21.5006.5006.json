    "abstract_text": "Type I Gaucher disease (GD) the is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia and skeletal complications due to the accumulation of glucocerebroside in macrophages. Thrombocytopenia is usually related to hypersplenism and infiltration of bone marrow by lipid-laden macrophages namely Gaucher cells. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) restores the hemoglobin and platelet count in GD patients. In GD ERT treated patients, manifesting persistent low platelet counts, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) should be considered.Treatment of GD with concomitant ITP is a challenge. Splenectomy may worsen bone manifestations in GD patients and is controversial. Steroids should be used with caution because of possible induction of osteopenia and joints avascular necrosis. Thrombopoietin receptor analogues (TPO-RA) are therapeutic option in GD patients with ITP. Beneficial use of TPO-RA is reported in 2 cases. Patient 1: 39 YO male with new onset of purpura and low platelet count failed treatment with 1 mg/kg of Prednisone. Bone marrow biopsy (BM) showed Gaucher cells infiltration, numerous atypical megakaryocytes, normal erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis with no fibrosis. Low level of \u00df-glucocerebrosidase activity with compound heterozygosity for 84GG /R495H mutations, established the diagnosis of Type I GD. Low C4 and detection of IgG platelet antibodies added to the diagnosis of concomitant immune thrombocytopenia. ERT with taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso TM ) 60 Units/kg/month was given with Prednisone for six weeks. Occurrence of retinal bleeding and purpura, with decrease of platelet count necessitated addition of high-dose IVIG with no response regarding platelet counts. Splenectomy was not considered due to known bony complication risk in splenectomised GD patients. Rituximab was given to prevent wet purpura recurrence with short response regarding platelet count. Romiplostim was initiated raising platelet count from 29,000/\u00b5L to 60,000/\u00b5L after 3 wks. and to 90,000/\u00b5L after 8 wks. enabling corticosteroids withdrawal. Same dose Romiplostim is maintained for the last 30 months with platelet counts of 90,000 - 110,000/\u00b5L with no bleeding events. Repeated BMB showed no increase in collagen fibrosis. Patient 2: 63 YO female patient diagnosed with Gaucher at age 33 with a history of purpura, ecchymosis, and occasional vaginal bleeding episodes. At age 53 the platelet count dropped to < 20,000/\u00b5L with presence of Anti Platelets Ab (IgG). BMB revealed megakaryocytic hyperplasia with atypical forms, focal infiltration by Gaucher cells and no fibrosis. Combined therapy by ERT (Imiglucerase\u00ae followed by Velaglucerase Alfa\u00ae), Prednisone (1mg/kg/d for 2 months) and one course of IVIG yielded no increase in platelet count. The patient refused Rituximab\u00ae. Romiplostim was initiated increasing platelet count to100,000/\u00b5L maintained throughout a year of follow up. Repeated BMB showed slight increase of fibrosis and marked hyperplasia of atypical megakaryocytes. Discussion: Thrombocytopenia is often present in GD and may be severe in approximately 15% of the patients. Persistent cytopenias may be caused by other underlying pathologies such as autoimmune disorders and are important to be recognized and addressed. Before ERT era GD patients with hypersplenism and severe cytopenia were splenectomised. Risks of splenectomy include serious bacterial infection and vascular complications limiting its use in chronic refractory ITP. Splenectomy is avoided in Gaucher patients, due to risk of exacerbating skeletal complications (bone infarcts, avascular necrosis). Stable bone marrow results regarding fibrosis in our patients are consistent with data from a recent 2-year follow-up of 100 ITP patients receiving Romiplostim treatment with no evidence of BM fibrosis. Conclusion: In patients with type I Gaucher disease and concomitant ITP, adjunctive treatment with Romiplostim was successful in maintaining haemostatic platelet counts with no adverse effects. Traditional treatment regimens of corticosteroids and splenectomy should be used with caution or avoided in GD patients due to possible aggravation of Gaucher skeletal disease and the risk of osteopenia and avascular necrosis resulting in increased morbidity in this cohort of patients. Use of TPO-RA should be considered in GD patients with ITP. Disclosures Off Label Use: Romiplostim in gaucher patients.",
