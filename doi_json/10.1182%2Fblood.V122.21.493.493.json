    "abstract_text": "Background There is conflicting data on the effect of the addition of ATRA to chemotherapy in AML. Two large randomised trials showed no benefit (Estey et al Blood 1999; 93, 2478 (n=215); Burnett et al. Blood 2010, 115: 9482 (n=1075)), or benefit which was limited to patients with an NPM1 mutation (n=14) when given in combination with ICE (Idarubicin/Ara-C/Etoposide) (Schlenk et al, Leukemia 2004, 18; 1798 (n=242)) but not with DA alone. In an effort to prospectively clarify if this is predictive treatment for NPM1+ patients and whether the effect was etoposide dependent, we randomised 616 patients to DA vs ADE and ATRA vs no ATRA in a 2x2 factorial design. Methods Between August 2010 and May 2012, 616 patients were randomised. The median age was 67(53-82) years: 75% had de novo, 16% had secondary, and 8% had high risk MDS (marrow blasts 10-19%): 4%, 75% and 21% had favourable, intermediate or poor risk cytogenetics: ITD and NPM1 data was available on 422 and 404 patients, with mutation rates of 19% and 24%. A total of 56 patients (14% of those with data) were molecularly good risk (NPM1 mutant, ITD wild type). By Wheatley risk score, 24%, 40% and 36% had good, standard or poor risk disease. The demographic, cytogenetic, molecular and allocated treatments were balanced between the arms. Follow-up is complete to 1 st January 2013 (median follow-up 18.7 months) Patients were given Daunorubicin 50mg/m 2 days 1-3 + Ara-C 100mg/m 2 bid days 1-10 (course 1) or days 1-8 (course 2). Those allocated ATRA were treated at 45mg/m 2 /day for 60 days; Etoposide in the ADE arm was given at 100mg/m 2 /day on days 1-5 of courses 1 and 2 of chemotherapy. Results The overall response rate (ORR) was 69% (CR 53%+ CRi 16%) and survival at 2 years was 35%. The ORR was not different between DA: 68% (CR 53%, CRi 15%) and ADE: 70% (CR 53%, CRi 17%), odds ratio (OR) 0.92 (0.65-1.30) p=0.6, although remission rates were non-significantly lower in patients given ATRA (ORR 66% (CR 53%, CRi 13%) vs 73% (CR 54%, CRi 19%), OR 1.39 (0.98-1.95) p=0.06) with significantly higher 30-day (16% vs 8%, p=0.005) and 60-day mortality (20% vs 12%, p=0.005). There were no differences in early mortality between ADE and DA arms. At 2 years, neither survival nor RFS differed between the arms: (ADE vs DA OS: 33% vs 36%, HR 1.07 (0.86-1.32) p=0.6; RFS: 23% vs 36% HR 1.15 (0.88-1.49) p=0.3; ATRA vs Not OS: 35% vs 35% HR 1.13 (0.91-1.40) p=0.3; RFS: 31% vs 30% HR 0.93 (0.71-1.20) p=0.6). Overall there was no interaction between the two treatments (OS, test for heterogeneity p=0.12). In an analysis stratified by Etoposide and by NPM1/ITD risk group there was no significant heterogeneity of the effect of ATRA (p=0.1, Figure ). Importantly, when looked at by the underlying chemotherapy, no beneficial effect of ATRA in NPM1 mutant/ITD WT patients appeared for patients receiving ADE (p=1.0 for heterogeneity).

Importantly, an analysis by NPM1/FLT3 genotype fails to reproduce the large benefits seen by Schlenk et al in ATRA treated patients with an NPM1 mutant/ITD wild type genotype, either overall or for patients treated with ADE, thus failing to substantiate a benefit for ATRA in either context. Based upon the results of AML16, neither Etoposide nor ATRA improve outcomes for older patients given intensive DA chemotherapy.
