    "abstract_text": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is characterized by a marked degree of morphologic and clinical heterogeneity. Recently, Rosenwalt et al. (N Engl J Med 2002) reported that four gene expression \u201csignature\u201d, 17 genes were identified as correlated with patient outcome by DNA microarray in DLBCL. In this study, we aim to establish predictor of outcome could help to identify patients who may benefit from risk-adjusted therapies in advance. To do it, we evaluate the prognostic relevance of 17 gene expressions in 72 patients with DLBCL who received a conventional chemotherapy. Seventeen genes were studied using RT-PCR assay from paraffin-embedded sections at the time of diagnosis. The median age of the patients was 58 years (range: 21\u201380 years). When we initially exam an appropriative patient\u2019s selection for survival analysis, overall survival (OS) at 2 years in patients with the international prognostic index (IPI) < 2 and IPI \u2265 2 were 95.2\u00b14.6% and 50.6\u00b111.8%, respectively ( p = 0.009), and progression free survival (PFS) at 2 years in patients with the IPI < 2 and IPI \u2265 2 were 75.0\u00b19.7% and 46.7\u00b112.9%, respectively ( p = 0.049). Of the 17 genes, patients with uPA expression showed a shorter OS compared with those without the gene expression. Additionally, patients with the expression of NPM3, uPA, fibronectin, or IMAGE814622 showed a shorter PFS compared with those without the gene expressions. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the gene expression profiling with simple RT-PCR assay is useful for analysis of the prognostic implications in patients with DLBCL.",
