    "abstract_text": "Although TP53 mutations are rare in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), inactivation of wild-type p53 protein frequently occurs through overexpression of its negative regulator MDM2 (murine double minute 2). We investigated the effects of MI-63, a small molecule that activates p53 by inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction [ Ki value of 3 nM ( J Med Chem. 2006 ; 49 (12): 3432 \u20135 )] in AML cell lines. Treatment with MI-63 triggered apoptosis (evidenced by loss of membrane potential and externalization of phosphatidylserine) in AML cell lines with wild-type p53 (OCI-AML-3 and MOLM13) in a time and concentration-dependent manner (IC 50 at 72 hrs.= 2.5 \u03bcM for OCI-AML-3 and 1 \u03bcM for MOLM-13), while a p53-null AML cell line (HL-60) was resistant (IC 50 not reached at 10 \u03bcM). Moreover, knockdown of p53 in OCI-AML3 cells rendered this cell line resistant to MI-63 induced apoptosis while control vector infected OCI-AML-3 cells remained as sensitive to MI-63 similar to the parental cells. Mechanistic studies showed that MI-63 blocks G1/S phase transition in AML cells with wild-type p53 resulting in accumulation of cells in G1 phase (percentage cells inG 1 phase at 24 hrs. = 88.66% vs 43.49% in cultures with DMSO control) while MI-61, a skeletally related but inactive control compound failed to do so (41.63%). Treatment with MI-63 increased cellular levels of p53 and p53 dependent proteins in OCI-AML-3 cells that include p21 and BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein Puma and pro-apoptotic multi-domain Bcl-2 family member Bax. Additionally, MI-63 induced a profound decrease in the levels of MDM4, an MDM2 homolog that has been reported to mediate resistance to the effects of nutlin-3a, suggesting that MI-63 may offer a therapeutic advantage in cells expressing high levels of MDM4. Finally, supporting the concept that increased levels of p53 modulate the apoptotic rheostat both directly, by behaving as a BH3-only protein, and indirectly by increasing the levels of sensitizer BH3-only proteins, MI-63 potently synergized with AT-101, an orally available pan inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 (currently being evaluated as an antitumor agent in Phase I/II trials by Ascenta Therapeutics), to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in OCI-AML-3 cells (average combination index = 0.055\u00b10.019). Taken together our results support preclinical evaluation of novel small molecule MI-63 alone and in combination with Bcl-2 inhibitors for the therapy of AML. The studies in primary AML samples are ongoing.
