    "abstract_text": "Chromosomal translocations are common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), causing gene fusions that encode oncogenic proteins. The NUP98 gene participates in chromosomal rearrangements with over 30 fusion partners and comprises 6-10% of de novo cases of pediatric AML. These fusions are associated with poor prognosis in children and adults. Among them, NUP98-KDM5A is further enriched in specific subpopulations, found in 15% of non-Down syndrome acute megakaryoblastic leukemia cases and 20% of pediatric acute erythroleukemia. Despite these associations, the direct impact of NUP98-KDM5A on the growth and differentiation of human hematopoietic cells has not been systemically studied. In this study, we transduced cord blood CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with NUP98-KDM5A or control lentiviral vectors and examined cell proliferation and differentiation. Exposure to cytokines (SCF, TPO, IL-6, FLT3L, SR-1) selected for CD34+ cell growth, and expression of NUP98-KDM5A increased proliferation rate in liquid culture by 19.4-fold ( p <0.01). In addition to a growth advantage, expression of NUP98-KDM5A led to differences in differentiation. NUP98-KDM5A expressing cells showed a 4.9-fold decrease ( p <0.05) in myeloid terminal differentiation (defined as the CD33+, CD11B+ population) and 2.8-fold increase ( p <0.05) in early stem cell progenitors (defined as the CD117+ population). Interestingly, NUP98-KDM5A expressing cells showed a 3.3-fold increase ( p <0.01) in the erythroid population (defined by the CD235a+, CD71+ population). The increase in erythroid differentiation was confirmed by RNA sequencing, which showed an enrichment in genes involved in heme metabolism (Hallmark Heme Metabolism, FDR q-value 7.33x10 -8 ) after only 72 hours post-transduction. Furthermore, RNA sequencing demonstrated upregulation of HOXA genes, including HOXA3, HOXA5, HOXA6, HOXA7, HOXA9, HOXA10 and HOXA11 ( p 3.36x10 -2 - 1.16x10 -7 ), which has been previously described in other high-risk leukemic fusions (including other NUP98 fusions) as a primary mechanism of stem-cell renewal. To further elucidate NUP98-KDM5A effects on differentiation, cytokine supplements known to drive myeloid differentiation (SCF, TPO, G-CSF, and GM-CSF) were added to culture media, which demonstrated the same disruption in myelo-erythropoiesis based on a 4.0-fold decrease (p<0.001) in the terminal myeloid population, a 3.2-fold increase in CD117+ (p <0.001 ) , and 2.6-fold increase in erythroid markers (p <0.001 ) . Furthermore, NUP98-KDM5A recapitulated this phenotype in methylcellulose colony forming assays, with increased BFU-E and reduced CFU-GM colonies compared to control ( p <0.01), despite no difference in overall colony number. Taken together, these in vitro studies demonstrate increased proliferation and altered differentiation in HSPCs by NUP98-KDM5A , with the pattern of differentiation by NUP98-KDM5A paralleling the M6 (erythroleukemia) AML subtype observed in patient samples harboring this fusion, supporting the clinical observation that NUP98-KDM5A is often a monogenic driver. To evaluate the leukemic potential of NUP98-KDM5A , cells were injected into NRG-SGM3 mice with NUP98-KDM5A inducing at 12 weeks a rapidly lethal myeloid disease in vivo (97.8% human CD45+ cells vs. 2.3% in control, p<0.001) . Furthermore, spleens of the NUP98-KDM5A mice were markedly enlarged, weighing on average 926.7g vs. 47.3g spleens seen in control, a 19.8-fold increase in weight (p<0.05). In conclusion, the expression of NUP98-KDM5A in HSPCs drives proliferation and alters differentiation to maintain stem cell markers while driving an erythroid phenotype in vitro . Furthermore, this fusion is sufficient to engraft in the bone marrow and spleen of NRG-SGM3 mice in vivo and cause marked splenomegaly. Taken together, these data suggest this model properly recapitulates the human disease phenotype seen in patients expressing NUP98-KDM5A and future functional assays and drug screens may provide important insights into understanding the pathophysiology and pharmacologic vulnerabilities of this fusion class.
