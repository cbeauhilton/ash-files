    "abstract_text": "Abstract 417 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) exhibit differential expression in cancer and can be used as prognostic biomarkers. MiR-181a expression is reported to be associated with survival and outcome in acute myeloid and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. We demonstrated that miR-181a levels are independently associated with improved survival of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated with R-CHOP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, Oncovin, Prednisolone). However, the mechanism underlying this observation and the function of miR-181a in DLBCL pathogenesis are unknown. MiR-181a was expressed at higher levels in centroblasts compared to nai\u0308ve and memory B cells, and at significantly higher levels in GCB-like compared to ABC-like DLBCL cell lines ( p =0.017). These observations suggested that miR-181a may differentially target critical signaling pathways in GCB and ABC DLBCL. NF-kB serves a critical role in ABC DLBCL survival. Utilizing 3 miRNA target prediction algorithms, multiple NF-\u03baB signaling pathway transcripts harbored putative miR-181a binding sites. Consequently, we tested the effect of miR-181a on CARD11, IBK\u03b1, p105/p50, and C-Rel expression in DLBCL cell lines (HBL1, VAL). Compared with a scrambled miRNA control, miR-181a expression decreased protein and mRNA levels of these targets. To confirm the effect was direct, we fused the 3\u2032-UTR sequences of CARD11, IBK\u03b1, p105 and C-Rel, each containing miR-181a putative binding sites, to a luciferase reporter gene. Co-transfecting miR-181a with the corresponding constructs, we demonstrated that all the constructs had significantly repressed luciferase activity compared with a non-targeting control. The effect was specific, since miR-181a did not affect luciferase activity of CARD11, IBK\u03b1, p105 and C-Rel reporter constructs with mutated binding sites. Using an NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter assay, we next demonstrated that compared to a scrambled control, miR-181a significantly decreased NF-\u03baB reporter activity in DLBCL cell lines (VAL, SUDHL6, OCILY7, OCILY19, HBL1, RCK8). MiR-181a also decreased NF-\u03baB reporter activity induced by anti-IgM and TNF\u03b1 stimulation. Concordantly, anti-miR-181a increased endogenous p105/p50 and C-Rel protein levels. Because ubiquitinated-IKK\u03b3 drives NF-\u03baB signaling, we tested the effect of miR-181a in TNF\u03b1-stimulated 293T cells on ubiquitinated-IKK\u03b3. MiR-181a decreased levels of ubiquitinated-IKK\u03b3, corroborating the observed inhibitory effects on NF-\u03baB signaling. We reasoned that NF-\u03baB signaling repression should coincide with a decrease in endogenous transcription activity from NF-\u03baB promoters. Indeed, miR-181a decreased mRNA expression levels of NF-\u03baB target genes ( BCL2, IRF4, IL-6, IKBa, FN1, PIM1, BLR1, CCL3, CFLAR, FCER2, TP53 ) as measured by qRT-PCR in miR-181a-transfected HBL1 cells. Because miR-181a directly targets p105/p50 and REL proteins, we postulated that this may be one of the main mechanisms of NF-\u03baB signaling repression. Indeed, an electrophoresis mobility shift assay along with super-shifts analyses showed a decrease in the p105/p50 protein in HeLa nuclear extracts. To examine the biological significance of differential miR-181a expression between GCB- and ABC-like DLBCL and elucidate its potential role in DLBCL pathogenesis, we next assessed cell death (Annexin V, 7AAD) and cell proliferation (BrdU, 7AAD) in GCB (SUDHL4, OCILY7, OCILY19, VAL) and ABC (HBL1, OCILY10, RCK8, U2932) DLBCL cell lines transfected with GFP labeled precursor miR-181a. MiR-181a expression significantly increased cell death and apoptosis of ABC versus GCB DLBCL ( p =0.006). This was associated with a more pronounced G1 phase growth arrest in the ABC DLBCL cells. Our studies demonstrate that miR-181a is a master regulator of canonical NF-kB signaling by regulating the expression of multiple components of this pathway, an effect that may underlie the distinct prognosis of DLBCL with different miR-181a expression levels. Furthermore, miR-181a down regulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
