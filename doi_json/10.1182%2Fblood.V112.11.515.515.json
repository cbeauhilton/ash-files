    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Some severe hemophiliacs (FVIII/FIX2000 (SB) IU/Kg/year. Patients who did not fit these criteria were considered as intermediate bleeders (IB). FVIII was measured by chromogenic assay and ETP was measured in platelet-rich plasma after addition of tissue factor. Results: 22MB, 22SB and 28IB were enrolled. MB had lower clinical and radiological scores when compared with both IB and SB (p<0.005). MB showed an older age at first bleed compared to SB (p < 0.005) and p for trend among the 3 groups was also significant (p < 0.05). The prevalence of severe FVIII/FIX gene defects (null mutations) was lower and ETP values were higher in MB compared with both IB and SB (p<0.05; table 1). Conclusions: our results indicate an extremely low prevalence of null mutations in severe hemophiliacs with mild bleeding diathesis. The measurement of thrombin generation in platelet-rich plasma may allow to identify this subgroup of patients, not otherwise distinguishable by conventional functional assays.  . SB (#22) .
