    "abstract_text": "Introduction Primary refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) as well as relapse after salvage therapy displays a poor prognosis. Salvage radiation therapy alone does not provide sufficient disease control on locally chemoresistant DLBCL. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) provides the best progression-free survival when salvaged patients are transplanted in Complete Response (CR). The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of CCR in locally relapsed or refractory DLBCL, followed by ASCT in responding patients. Material and methods We report the outcome of consecutive patients with locally relapsed or refractory lymphoma for which a decision of CRC was taken in a single institution. Each patient has been assessed by CT or PET-scan. The CRC regimen consisted in 3 cycles of Rituximab (375 mg/m\u00b2 day 1), CDDP (30 mg/m\u00b2 3 days 1-3) and VP16 (120 mg/m\u00b2 days 1-3) at 21 days intervals, with concomitant radiotherapy delivered to the residual disease sites, administrated in 2 Gy fractions per day to a total dose of 30 Gy, starting on day 1 of the second cycle. Responding patients received ASCT with a BEAM conditioning at the end of the procedure. Extra-hematological toxicity was ranked according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Tumor response was evaluated according to IWG 1999 at 1 month after the last cycle of CRC, three months after ASCT if performed and during a quarterly follow-up. Results We identified 13 patients with localized chemoresistant DLBCL from January 2002 to April 2011 including 12 primary refractory forms. The median age was 56 years (20-76), 12 of 13 patients had received at least two lines of chemotherapy before inclusion with anthracycline and cisplatin. 11 patients achieved a partial response (85%) and 4 of them (31%) a complete response after the CRC. 8 (61.5%) patients were transplanted 1 month after the last cycle of CRC. 7 patients have relapsed within 6 months after the end of treatment. After a median follow-up of 37 months (range 21-125) for the surviving patients, 7 patients are alive and free of disease. The overall survival is 54%, and all surviving patients had been transplanted. No severe toxicity was reported. Conclusion CRC should be considered as an option in the therapeutic arsenal in refractory or locally relapsed DLBCL, especially in patients eligible for ASCT. Further research on CRC is warranted.
