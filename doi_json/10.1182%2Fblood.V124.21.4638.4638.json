    "abstract_text": "Background : CC-486 is an oral formulation of the epigenetic modifier, azacitidine, in clinical development for treatment (Tx) of hematological cancers. Part 1 of this phase I, multicenter study showed no effect on pharmacokinetics (PK) of CC-486 when taken with food or with a proton-pump inhibitor (Laille, 2014). A prospective extension phase of this study is ongoing to assess the safety and efficacy of CC-486. Objectives : To assess safety, tolerability, and hematological response associated with an extended CC-486 dosing schedule in patients (pts) with MDS, AML, or CMML. Methods : Eligible pts were age \u226518 years, had confirmed WHO-defined MDS, CMML, or AML based on bone marrow (BM) aspirate and biopsy, and an ECOG performance status score 0-2. In the PK phase, pts received 2 to 3 single CC-486 doses and in the extension phase, pts received CC-486 300 mg QD for the first 21 days of repeated 28-day cycles. Tx-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were coded by MedDRA v15.0 and graded using NCI-CTCAE v4.0. In addition to TEAEs for all pts, because PK-phase exposure was quite limited, TEAEs of interest are reported for the subset of pts who entered the extension phase (21-day dosing). Responses (complete or partial remission [CR, PR], CR with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi], marrow CR [mCR], hematologic improvement [HI], and transfusion independence [TI]) were defined by IWG 2006 (MDS) or IWG 2003 (AML) criteria. Baseline transfusion dependence (TD) was defined as \u22654 red blood cell (RBC) units or \u22652 platelet transfusions, in the 56 days before first dose. TI was defined as no transfusion for 56 consecutive days. The safety-evaluable cohort included all pts who received \u22651 CC-486 dose. Efficacy-evaluable pts had \u22651 post-baseline efficacy measurement during the extension phase as of data cut-off (June 6, 2014). Efficacy results are reported for the combined MDS and CMML pt population and separately for pts with AML. Results : A total of 32 pts (MDS n=19 [59%], CMML n=4 [13%], and AML n=9 [28%]) received \u22651 CC-486 dose and are evaluated for safety. Median (range) age of all pts was 72 (53-93) years, with 44% of pts age \u226575 years. Most pts were male (69%) and all were Caucasian. Median number of CC-486 Tx cycles for all pts was 4 (range 1-18), and within the MDS, CMML, and AML groups was 5 (1-18), 4 (2-17), and 1 (1-9), respectively. The mean \u00b1SD Tx cycle length was 30 \u00b19.0 days overall (by group: 33 \u00b18.3 days in MDS, 25 \u00b15.4 in CMML, and 27 \u00b110.7 in AML pts). The most frequent types of TEAE were gastrointestinal (GI) and hematological ( Table 1 ) . CC-486 dose was adjusted due to GI TEAEs for 5 pts (16%), and due to hematological TEAEs for 8 pts (25%). Of all 32 pts, 30 pts (94%) entered the 21-day dosing extension phase. Of these pts, GI TEAEs (grade \u22652) were reported for 23 pts (77%). Of these, only 4 grade 3 (vomiting and diarrhea, 2 each) and no grade 4 TEAEs were observed. Hematological TEAEs (grade \u22653) were reported for 19 pts (63%). Neutropenic grade \u22652 TEAEs occurred in 12 (40%) of 30 pts, of which 29% were grade 2, 38% grade 3, and 32% grade 4. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 3 pts and grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 3. Most TEAEs occurred during the first 2 Tx cycles: GI, 73% and hematological, 55%. The efficacy-evaluable population at data cut-off included 27 pts (84%): 20 pts with MDS or CMML, and 7 pts with AML ( Table 2 ). One pt with MDS achieved CR, 1 pt with AML achieved CRi, and 1 pt with AML achieved PR (pt was to proceed to transplant). Of HI-evaluable pts in the MDS+CMML and AML groups, respectively, 6/18 (33%) and 2/7 (29%) attained an HI response. Few pts were TD at baseline. Of pts who were RBC TD at baseline, 1/5 pts (20%) in the MDS+CMML group and 1/5 pts (20%) in the AML group attained RBC TI. Of 3 pts who were platelet TD at baseline, 1 pt with AML attained platelet TI. Conclusions : CC-486 can provide the flexibility to adjust dose or dosing regimen to improve tolerability or efficacy as needed. The safety and tolerability of CC-486 300 mg QD taken for the first 21 days of repeated 28-day cycles were consistent with the known safety profile of injectable azacitidine in these pts with MDS, CMML, and AML. Grade 3-4 gastrointestinal TEAEs were infrequent (<20% of all pts). Grade 3-4 neutropenias were observed and deserve scrutiny, especially in the first 2 Tx cycles, and in some cases may warrant initiation of prophylactic antibiotics, particularly in pts with prolonged grade 4 neutropenia. HI rates of ~30% observed in this trial were similar to previous reports of CC-486.
