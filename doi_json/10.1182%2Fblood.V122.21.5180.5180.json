    "abstract_text": "Background The introduction of Imatinib therapy has significantly changed the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and improved survival. Since the International Randomized Study of Interferon (IRIS), a number of studies were conducted involving diverse populations and showed significant variations in the treatment outcome. To date, there has been no published study on the effectiveness of imatinib in adult CML patients in Saudi Arabia. The aim of the present study was to present a single-institution experience in the treatment with imatinib of newly diagnosed patients with CML and compare it with results from international studies. Methods A total of 101 medical records of consecutive adult CML patients treated with imatinib as first line therapy at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia between 2001 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Survival and response rates were evaluated. Results The estimated overall survival (OS) rates at 5 and 10 years were 95%\u00b12.3% when patients were stratified by cytogenetic type (stander vs.variant Ph positive chromosome) at presentations, significant difference in OS, EFS, and PFS were noted (P=0.001). Complete haematological response was achieved in 94 (93.1%) of our patients, cytogenetic response (CR) in 84 (83.2%) while complete and major cytogenetic response (MCR) were observed in 70 (69.3%) and 6 (5.9%) of the patients respectively. (MR), 62 patients (61.4%) achieved major molecular response (MMR) and 34 (33.7%) complete molecular response. Conclusion compared to other studies among different population, our results confirm the previously noted variation in the response to imatinib. Our study has shown that Ph variant has an impact on the outcome. Further study may be indicated. However second TKI generations as first line in treatment CML with Ph variants should be consider!
