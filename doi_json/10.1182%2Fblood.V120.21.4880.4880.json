Improved outcomes are associated with retention of dose and schedule. Pegfilgrastim prophylaxis reduces the severity and duration of neutropenia, contributing to fewer dose delays and reductions and higher RDI. A retrospective analysis of pegfilgrastim NHL clinical trials showed that pegfilgrastim primary prophylaxis maintained RDI for CHOP/CHOP-R; a greater number of younger than older pts had > 85% RDI (Mo et al. Pan Pacific Lymphoma Conference 2011; poster). Here we further examine the association of age with RDI for CHOP/CHOP-R in NHL pts receiving pegfilgrastim. Methods: This retrospective analysis pooled data from 5 pegfilgrastim NHL clinical trials (1 single-arm and 4 randomized controlled studies). Pts received up to 6 cycles of CHOP/CHOP-R every 2 (Q2W) or 3 (Q3W) weeks. Data from the pegfilgrastim primary prophylaxis tx arms were combined. RDI and the incidence of dose delay, reduction, discontinuation, and adverse events (AE) leading to dose alteration/discontinuation were analyzed in the CHOP/CHOP-R regimens combined and stratified by age group (< 65, 65\u201375, and > 75 years [yr] ) and schedule (Q2W and Q3W). RDI during tx exposure and RDI adjusted by the planned 6 cycles of tx were calculated. Overall RDI of the regimen was calculated as the average of RDI of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. Dose delay: > 3 days of delay for any cycle after cycle 1. Dose reduction: \u2265 20% reduction from the planned dose of cyclophosphamide or doxorubicin for any cycle. Dose discontinuation: not completing all planned 6 cycles of tx for reasons other than death/disease progression. RDI was also evaluated with a multiple regression model using tx group, age, stage, sex, race and comorbidity as explanatory variables. Results: In the Q3W regimen (N = 137), 50% of pts were women, 36% had stage IV disease, and 23% were > 75 yr. In studies with available histology data, most pts had diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The incidence of pts with > 85% RDI during tx exposure: 89%, 86% and 81% for pts < 65, 65\u201375 and > 75 yr, respectively. The incidence of pts with > 85% adjusted RDI: 74%, 55% and 47%, respectively. The incidence of pts who completed all 6 cycles of tx: 78%, 56% and 47%, respectively. The incidence of dose reduction: 7%, 21% and 13%, respectively. The incidence of dose discontinuation: 19%, 36% and 47%, respectively. The incidence of dose delay was similar among age groups. Multiple regression analysis showed age and cancer stage as potential factors associated with RDI (p = 0.0290 and 0.0145, respectively).

View Large Conclusions: In this pooled population the incidence of pts with > 85% RDI adjusted by the planned 6 cycles of tx was lower in older pts as fewer older pts completed all 6 cycles of tx. Pts < 65 yr had a lower incidence of AE leading to dose alteration/discontinuation. The AE profile was widely spread across hematological and non-hematological toxicities. Unlike prior reports where myelosuppression frequently caused reduced RDI, myelotoxicity was an infrequent cause of therapy alteration/discontinuation with pegfilgrastim primary prophylaxis (< 7%). Pegfilgrastim use in elderly pts maintained RDI during tx exposure. Further research is needed to address non-hematologic causes of tx interruptions in elderly pts receiving CHOP based chemotherapy.
