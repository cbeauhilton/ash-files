    "abstract_text": "Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN) characterized by megakaryocyte hyperplasia, progressive bone marrow fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis and transformation to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). A number of phenotypic driver (JAK2, CALR, MPL) and additional subclonal mutations have been described in PMF, pointing to a complex genomic landscape. To discover novel genomic lesions that can contribute to disease phenotype and/or development, we integrated gene expression and copy number (CN) signals and identified several genomic abnormalities leading to a concordant alteration in gene expression levels. In particular, copy number gain in the polyamine oxidase (PAOX) gene locus is accompanied by a coordinated transcriptional up-regulation in PMF patients. To assess the impact of PAOX deregulation on the survival of PMF and normal primary hematopoietic cells, PMF and normal donors cells were incubated with increasing doses of the PAOX inhibitor MDL-72,572. PAOX inhibition resulted in rapid cell death of PMF progenitor cells (5,7\u00b10,9% of late apoptotic cells in NT sample vs 20,1\u00b13,2% in 150\u03bcM treated-sample, p<0.05), while survival of normal CD34+ cells was not affected (0,97\u00b10,09 of late apoptotic cells in NT sample vs 2,7\u00b10,4 in 150\u03bcM treated-sample, p<0.05), as monitored by Annexin V/PI staining. These data suggest that PAOX inhibition could represent a therapeutic strategy to selectively target PMF cells without affecting normal hematopoietic cells' survival. Moreover, our integrative analysis of gene expression and CN data pointed out the concomitant copy number loss and transcriptional down-regulation in PMF patients of the chromatin modifier HMGXB4 . Interestingly, silencing of HMGXB4 in CD34+ stem/progenitor cells induced megakaryocyte differentiation, as demonstrated by increased expression of CD41 (36\u00b11,9% vs 26,1\u00b12,9% at day 12, 52,5\u00b14,9% vs 33\u00b11% at day 14 of serum free liquid culture, p<0.05) and increased number of CFU-MK colonies (27,7\u00b12,5 vs 18,1\u00b11,3% in small CFU-MK colonies, p<0.05). On the other hand, HMGXB4 silencing repressed the erythroid differentiation, as indicated by a decrease in the percentage of cells positive for the erythroid marker GPA (10.8%\u00b15.6 vs 24.8%\u00b15, p<0.05) and significant decrease in Burst Forming Unit-Erythroid (BFU-E) and Colony-Forming Unit-Erythroid (CFU-E) (47,9\u00b16 vs 60,5\u00b17,6, p<0.05). Taken together, these data suggest that HMGXB4 silencing in human HSPCs favors megakaryocyte differentiation while restraining the erythroid lineage. These results highlight a previously un-reported, yet potentially interesting role of HMGXB4 in the hematopoietic system and suggest that genomic and transcriptional imbalances of HMGXB4 could contribute to the aberrant expansion of the megakaryocytic lineage that characterize PMF patients. In conclusion, our work sheds light on the influence of genomic abnormalities on gene expression regulation in PMF CD34+ cells and on their impact to features typical of PMF, such as a hyperplastic megakaryopoiesis and resistance to apoptosis, and therefore potentially contributing to the development of the myeloproliferative disease.
