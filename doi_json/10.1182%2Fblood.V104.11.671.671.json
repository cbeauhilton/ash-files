    "abstract_text": "CCAAT/ enhancer binding protein \u03b1 (C/EBP \u03b1) is a member of the bZIP family of transcription factors that plays a critical role for early myeloid differentiation. C/EBP \u03b1 knockout mice showed a complete differentiation block at myeloblast stage in hematopoietic system, and mature neutrophils and eosinophils are absent in the peripheral blood. Lineage specification in developmental tree of hematopoiesis is generally determined by a lineage specific transcription factors such as C/EBP \u03b1 and GATA-1 that allow commitment to the specific lineage with simultaneous extinction of their capacity to differentiate into the other ones. However, recent evidences shown by the ectopic expression of above transcription factors unveiled the unexpected developmental plasticity of various progenitors such as MEP (erythroid/ megakaryocyte progenitor) and CLP (common lymphoid progenitor). GATA-1 is reported to convert CLP and CMP (common myeloid progenitor) into erythroid/ megakaryocyte lineage, however, the effect of C/EBP \u03b1 on MEP and CLP is still unlcear. In order to investigate the role of C/EBP \u03b1 in the various aspect of hematopoietic differentiation, especially its effect on the lineage specification at different stages of differentiation in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing inducible form of C/EBP \u03b1 (C/EBP \u03b1-ER) under H-2K promoter (C/EBP \u03b1-ER Tg). In these mice, C/EBP \u03b1 activity can be induced conditionally by 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-HT) in all hematopoietic cells. As expected, C/EBP \u03b1-ER was expressed in almost all hematopoietic tissues including bone marrow, spleen and thymus in these mice. Gel shift analysis revealed that C/EBP \u03b1-ER was activated by 4-HT, and showed specific binding to C/EBP-specific oligonucleotide in these tissues. Next we tested differentiation plasticity of erythroid and lymphoid progenitors by ectopically inducing C/EBP \u03b1-ER activity in these cells. We sorted MEP and CLP by FACS from C/EBP \u03b1-ER Tg and examined their clonogenic activities in the presence or absence of 4-HT. In the absence of 4-HT, MEP and CLP exclusively formed erythroid/ megakaryocyte and lymphoid colonies, respectively, as previously reported. Surprisingly however, these cells dramatically changed their fate of differentiation and formed significant numbers of granulocyte/ macrophage (GM) colonies in the presence of 4-HT, indicating that ectopic activation of C/EBP \u03b1-ER activity skewed their differentiation pathways to myeloid lineage. Cytospin preparation of the colonies and RT-PCR analysis revealed that these were accompanied by the morphological differentiation to granulocytes/ macrophages, and upregulation of myeloid-specific genes at mRNA level. These results indicate that MEP and CLP are not fully committed to either erythroid/ megakaryocyte or lymphoid lineage, and possess differentiation plasticity that can be redirected to myeloid lineage."
