    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) who are on initial treatment, report low levels of symptoms and a higher quality of life index in contrast to patients who have relapsed (Pettengell et al. Ann Oncol 2008). In the immunochemotherapy era, effective and safe treatments should create minimal treatment-related symptoms, regardless of the underlying patient characteristics. In the GALLIUM study (NCT01332968), patients treated with obinutuzumab (G)-chemotherapy followed by G maintenance reported low levels of symptoms (Davies et al. Ann Hematol 2020). Short duration infusions (SDI) of treatments for patients with untreated, advanced FL may yield substantial time savings for patients, and free up healthcare resources. The GAZELLE study (NCT03817853) is a prospective open label, multicenter, single arm, Phase IV study, which evaluated the safety of G administered as a 90-minute (min) SDI infusion from Cycle 2 (C2) onwards in patients with previously untreated advanced FL. G SDI appears to be safe, with no Grade 3 infusion-related reactions (IRRs) reported in C2, and only one Grade 3 IRR reported in subsequent cycles (Canales et al. ASCO 2021). In this analysis, we report symptom levels and provider preference during G SDI administration. Methods: During the first cycle, patients received the first three infusions of G (1000mg) administered at the standard infusion rate on Days 1, 8, and 15. Patients who did not experience any Grade \u22653 IRRs during the first cycle received G as a SDI from C2 onwards. The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI: range 0 [not present) to 10 [worst]) was used to assess the severity of disease/treatment-related symptoms, and how symptoms interfere with aspects of the patient's daily living. It was completed on Day 1 of C1-6, at the end of induction, during maintenance, at the end of maintenance, and at the end of the study. Additional MDASI analyses were conducted based on patient risk groups (bulky disease, Ann Arbor staging, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score, B-symptoms, Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index). At any time point after C4 Day 1, study investigators (physicians and nurses) completed an evaluation composed of questions addressing their site's experience with regards to time saved, convenience and infusion preference after administration of SDI and standard infusion of G, across all patients enrolled in the study. Results: 110/113 patients received at least one SDI of G, as per protocol. Median age was 62 years, (range: 28-86 years) and 62% of patients had stage IV FL, 51% presented with B-symptoms at baseline, 45% with bulky disease and 45% were classified as high-risk FLIPI. Median baseline MDASI severity and interference scores were 0 or 1 for most symptoms. Interference scores did not meaningfully change over the course of treatment. Median MDASI scores (baseline or change over treatment), also did not differ by risk subgroups. Over 60% of providers reported that SDI of G would save at least 2 hours in infusion time per visit, with >65% saying it was much more convenient versus regular infusion. SDI was preferred by >95% of providers for reasons attributed to time savings and patient comfort. Conclusions: Untreated, advanced FL patients had no or mild symptom severity and interference at baseline regardless of risk group. These low levels were maintained during G SDI administration. Additionally, SDI administration was preferred by providers for the time it saved, convenience, and comfort for patients, suggesting that G SDI administration can be a beneficial treatment option for untreated, advanced FL patients by minimizing patient treatment burden with no impact on health-related quality of life.
