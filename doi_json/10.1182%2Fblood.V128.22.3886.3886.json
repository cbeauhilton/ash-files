    "abstract_text": "Bone marrow stromal stem cells (BMSCs) are essential components of the hematopoietic environment. BMSCs play a key role in regulating hematopoiesis and, furthermore, as skeletal stem cells they give rise to osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. However, despite this important role of BMSCs in bone and bone marrow physiology, little is known about how proliferation, differentiation and hematopoietic support functions of BMSCs are regulated. We hypothesized that primary human BMSCs have a distinct transcriptional regulatory system, which control BMSC stem cell properties and biological functions. We have previously reported gene expression profiling of highly-enriched human primary BMSCs (Li et al, Stem Cell Reports, 3(6):965-74, 2014), which demonstrated a substantially higher expression of early growth response 1 (EGR1) in primary cells compared to the non-colony-forming cells and cultured stromal cells, respectively. EGR1 is a member of the immediate early response transcription factor family, which has a function in cell growth, development, and stress responses in many tissues. EGR1 has been previously reported to be important for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation and localization (Min et al. Cell Stem Cell, 2(4):380-91, 2008), but its role in non-hematopoietic bone marrow cells has thus far not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to study the possible role of EGR1 in stroma stem cell proliferation and hematopoietic supporting function. Our data demonstrate that the expression of EGR1 as measured by qPCR was 126 \u00b1 9-fold higher in highly fibroblast colony-forming cells (CFU-F) enriched human primary lin neg /CD45 neg /CD271 pos /CD140a neg bone marrow cells compared to the non-colony forming CD45 neg /CD271 neg cell population. Furthermore, EGR1 expression in CD271 pos CD140a neg cells was 3 \u00b1 0.2 -fold higher than in the CD271 pos CD140a pos cell population, which has only minimal CFU-F activity. EGR1 expression decreased dramatically during culture with a more than 30-fold difference between primary and passage one and six cells. Down-regulation of EGR1 expression by shRNA did not affect the multi-differentiation capacity (adipogenic, osteogenic) and surface marker expression profile of BMSCs in vitro compared to controls. However, colony-forming capacity and proliferation was considerably increased in EGR1 knockdown cells, i.e. shRNA- transduced stromal cells produced up to 1.8 \u00b1 0.1-fold more CFU-F compared to controls, whereas CFU-F were virtually absent when assaying EGR1 overexpressing cells. Furthermore, population doubling times were decreased in EGR1 knockdown cells but significantly increased (2.4 \u00b1 0.3-fold) in EGR1 overexpressing cells. These data indicate that EGR1 expression negatively regulates BMSC proliferation and colony-forming capacity. On the other hand, hematopoietic support function was decreased in EGR1 knockdown cells as measured by the production of transplantable CD34 pos CD90 pos HSC in stroma co-culture experiments (4-day serum-free culture supplemented with SCF 25 ng/ml, TPO 25 ng/ml, and FLT3L 25 ng/ml, 1\u00d710 4 CD34 pos seeded cord blood cells). Here, the positive effect of the supporting stroma was neutralized by knockdown of EGR1. Numbers of CD34 pos CD90 pos HSC produced in co-cultures with EGR1 knockdown stroma cells were as low as 1,053 \u00b1 316 compared to 6,100 \u00b1 840 in control co-cultures (scamble control). Without stroma, 840 \u00b1 210 CD34 pos CD90 pos cells were generated from 1\u00d710 4 seeded CD34 pos cells. Furthermore, expansion of CD34 pos CD90 pos CB cells was increased in co-cultures with EGR1 overexpressing cells, indicating that EGR1is a positive regulator of hematopoietic stroma support in human BMSC, and confirmatory in-vivo xenotransplantation studies are ongoing. In summary, EGR1 is highly expressed by primary BM-MSC compared with non-colony forming cells and is downregulated during culture. EGR1 expression negatively regulates BMSC proliferation and colony formation while positively regulating hematopoietic stroma support function. Our data thus indicate that EGR1 may act as an important BMSC regulator coordinating the specific functions of BMSC in their different biological contexts.
