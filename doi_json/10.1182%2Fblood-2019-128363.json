    "abstract_text": "Antibodies containing a fluorescent label or recombinant proteins containing a fluorescent reporter are commonly used to visualize proteins in situ. However, antibodies and bulky reporters can perturb protein structure and function. To overcome this problem, we have designed a minimally perturbing blue fluorescent unnatural amino acid that enables the direct imaging of intrinsically-fluorescent proteins with their interaction partners. Specifically, we used a nitrile-derivatized tryptophan, 4-cyanotryptophan (4CNTrp), which differs by only two atoms from native tryptophan. 4CNTrp has unique photophysical properties in the visible blue region: an absorption maximum at ~325 nm, an emission maximum at ~420 nm, a large fluorescence quantum yield (>0.8 in aqueous solution), a long fluorescence lifetime (ca. 13 ns), and good photostability (Hilaire et al. PNAS 2017; 114: 6005-09). Based on these properties, 4CNTrp-labeling was recently used to visualize the binding of a model peptide pHLIP (pH-(Low) Insertion Peptide) to cell membranes via wide-field fluorescence microscopy. 4CNTrp is also a viable FRET donor for acceptor pairs in the green visible region. 4CNTrp can be prepared by a simple, high-yielding cost-effective synthetic route and because it does not inhibit bacterial growth, it may be practical for cellular applications (Zhang et al. Chem. Comm. 2019; 55: 5095-98). Here, we used 4CNTrp-labeled peptides to directly image integrins on cell surfaces. Previously, we described the synthesis of peptides, called CHAMP peptides for Computed Helical Anti-Membrane Protein, that target the transmembrane (TM) domains of integrins in a sequence-specific manner (Yin et al. Science 2007; 315: 1817-22). Thus, the CHAMP peptides anti-\u03b1IIb and anti-\u03b1v specifically bind to the TM domains of \u03b1IIb and \u03b1v in platelet membranes, causing separation of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23 TM domains and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23 activation. Anti-\u03b1IIb also caused \u03b1IIb\u03b23 clustering that was visualized using the \u03b23-specific monoclonal antibody SSA6 labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 but only after the platelets were fixed with paraformaldehyde to prevent antibody-induced clustering. To enable the direct visualization of \u03b1II\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b23, and \u03b12\u03b21 on cell surfaces, we used solid-phase peptide synthesis to generate CHAMP peptides labeled with 4CNTrp at their N-termini (CN-\u03b1IIb, CN-\u03b1v, CN-\u03b21). We found that 4CNTrp labeling did not perturb the ability of the CHAMP peptides to bind to integrins and to cause specific integrin activation. Thus, CN-\u03b1IIb caused \u03b1IIb\u03b23-dependent platelet aggregation, CN-\u03b1v caused the \u03b1v\u03b23-dependent platelet adhesion to osteopontin, and CN-\u03b11 caused \u03b12\u03b21-mediated platelet adhesion to collagen. We then used high resolution wide-field deconvolution microscopy to image 4CNTrp-containing integrins on the surface of platelets, HEL cells, and transfected CHO cells. Compared to 4CNTrp-containing random peptides that uniformly decorate cell surfaces, the CN-labeled CHAMP peptides were present as a limited number of discrete foci on the cell surface. To confirm that these foci represented CN-peptide containing integrins, we co-stained the cells with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled integrin-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that CN-peptide and antibody fluorescence coincided. Thus, these studies demonstrate the specific and direct imaging of integrins embedded in cell membranes in their activated state using 4CNTrp-labeled anti-integrin TM peptides. Because 4CNTrp can readily be incorporated into proteins and peptides with little if any structural perturbation, 4CNTrp-labeling provides a facile way to directly monitor protein behavior and protein-protein interactions in cellular environments.
