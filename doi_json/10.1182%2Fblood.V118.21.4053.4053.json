    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4053 High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant can improve long-term outcome of patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma. Stem cell mobilization with chemotherapy in addition to G-CSF improves stem cell collection, however it is also associated with increased risk of neutropenic fever. We analyze whether hospitalization for neutropenic fever (NF) affects outcomes after transplantation. From 1/1998 to 12/2008, 599 patients underwent chemotherapy priming with etoposide + G-CSF (27 patients also received rituximab). Forty five (8%) did not proceed to transplant. Of the 554 (92%) patients who were transplanted, the median age was 51 years, and 348 (63%) were male. The diagnoses were 422 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (63%) and 132 Hodgkin lymphoma (24%). A majority of these patients (92%) had received 3 or less prior chemotherapy regimens. Only 6% had been exposed to fludarabine therapy. Most patients had chemosensitive disease (88% were in CR or PR) at time of transplant. For preparative regimen: 517 (93%) received busulfan/etoposide/cyclophosphamide, 32 (5.8%) received melphalan, 5 (0.9%) received other chemotherapy. Of the transplanted patients, 121 (21.8%) were admitted for NF during stem cell mobilization. The median duration of admission for NF was 5 days (range 1\u201320). Six (5%) patients had bacteremia, 1 (<1%) had parainfluenza virus pneumonia, and the remainder 114 (94%) did not have any infection source or organism identified. The patients hospitalized for NF had significantly lower CD34+ cell collection (7.49 \u00d7 10^6 CD34 cells vs. 9.36 \u00d7 10^6, P=0.029) and lower CD34+ cell dose (7.34 \u00d7 10^6 CD34 cells/kg vs. 8.60 \u00d7 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg, P=0.047) despite more apheresis days required for collection (4 days vs. 3 days, P=0.01). Following transplant hospitalization, the 30-day readmission rate was higher in NF patients (16.8% compared to 8.8%, P=0.012). Hospitalization for NF was also associated with worse survival as shown below: View large Download slide View large Download slide  Close modal In conclusion, admission for neutropenic fever during stem cell mobilization is associated with significantly increased number of apheresis days required for adequate stem cell collection, lower CD34+ cell collection, higher 30-day re-admission rates, and poorer survival.
