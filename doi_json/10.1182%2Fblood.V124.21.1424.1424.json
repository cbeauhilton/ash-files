    "abstract_text": "Synucleins (including \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-synucleins) are a group of proteins that are highly expressed in the central nervous system. Alpha-synuclein, in particular, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders known as synucleinopathies. The function of these proteins in other organ systems is largely unknown. Some studies have demonstrated expression of \u03b1-synuclein on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), including B and T lymphocytes, NK cells and monocytes; and its expression has been shown to be higher in PBMCs of individuals with Parkinson\u2019s compared to healthy controls. We have recently shown that \u03b1-synuclein-deficiency is associated with marked defect in development of mature B and T lymphocytes. In particular, we showed enhanced negative selection of developing thymic T cells in the absence \u03b1-synuclein. Furthermore, we demonstrated that \u03b1-synuclein-deficiency is associated with an impaired IgG response to T cell-dependent antigens. Here we used age and sex-matched \u03b1-synuclein knock-out (KO) and wild type (WT) mice to further investigate the lineage differentiation and activation of T cells. We found that few splenic T cells that develop in KO mice contain a higher percentage of CD8 + T cell expressing early activation markers CD69 (7.6 \u00b1 0.09 for KO vs. 5.3 \u00b1 0.23 for WT, p =0.005, figure 1 A) and CD49d (12.97 \u00b1 0.3 for KO vs. 7.32 \u00b1 0.6 for WT, p =0.006, figure 1 A). A similar trend was noted for CD4 + CD49d + T cells, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (23.90 \u00b1 3.48 for KO vs.13.23 \u00b1 0.73 for WT, p =0.086, figure 1 A). No difference was noted in the expression of late activation marker CD44, and lymph node homing marker CD62L. This was associated with significantly increased IL-2 production from KO CD4 + T cells (OD 2.70 \u00b1 0.12 for KO vs.1.05 \u00b1 0.39 for WT, p =0.002, figure 1 B) and a trend for increased IFN-\u03b3 production from KO CD4 + T cells (OD 2.89 \u00b1 0.33 for KO vs.2.12 \u00b1 0.59 for WT, p =0.12) after in vitro activation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads. Interestingly, In vitro activation of splenic CD4 + T cells resulted in significantly reduced IL-4 production from KO T cells (OD 0.20 \u00b1 0.14 for KO, vs. 0.74 \u00b1 0.31 for WT, p=0.05, Figure 2 ) suggesting a defective Th2 differentiation in KO CD4 + T cells. Further flow cytometric analysis of T cells showed that while thymic Foxp3 + CD4 + regulatory T cells are significantly reduced in KO mice (3.07 \u00b10.35 for KO vs. 5.00 \u00b1 0.87 for WT, p =0.02, Figure 3 ), the percentage of splenic Foxp3 + CD4 + T cells is higher in the KO mice compared to WT mice (18.33 \u00b1 4.90 for KO vs.10.33 \u00b1 1.39 for WT, p =0.05, Figure 3 ). No difference was noted among NK cells from KO and WT mice. In summary, we demonstrate a role for \u03b1-synuclein in lineage differentiation and function of T cells. While \u03b1-synuclein-deficiency leads to a significant defect in development of mature T cells, the small population of cells that do mature, express higher levels of early activation markers, and produce higher levels of IL-2 upon antigenic stimulation. Of interest, these cells are defective in IL-4 production. Additionally, we also show that \u03b1-synuclein-deficiency is associated with a higher percentage of peripheral CD4 + Foxp3 + T cells, a finding that might be explained by higher levels of IL-2 production by \u03b1-synuclein-deficient CD4 + T cells, although a direct effect of \u03b1-synuclein on the survival of regulatory T cells cannot be excluded. The underlying mechanism for the function \u03b1-synuclein in development and function of T cells is subject of future studies.
