    "abstract_text": "Abstract 648 Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) can be a curative treatment for patients with relapsed hematological malignancies after HLA matched allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). However, curative responses in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia in lymphoid blastic phase (CML-BP) are infrequent after HLA matched DLI. This may be partly explained by the poor immunogenicity of these malignancies, since we previously demonstrated efficient induction of Graft-versus-Leukemia (GvL) immune responses in vitro and in vivo upon modification of ALL and CML-BP cells into leukemic antigen presenting cells (APC). Leukemic-APC may be particularly relevant for efficient generation of GvL immune responses after HLA matched DLI, since T cells recognizing allo-antigens in matched HLA molecules are known to reside in the nai\u0308ve T cell compartment. In contrast, T cells recognizing allo-antigens in mismatched HLA molecules reside in the memory T cell compartment as well. Since memory T cells can also be activated by non-professional APC, HLA mismatched alloSCT and DLI may particularly be considered as a treatment modality for induction of GvL reactivity against poorly immunogenic malignancies. However, T cell responses across HLA barriers can induce severe Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD). Mismatched HLA class I molecules, which are broadly expressed on all nucleated cells, are frequent targets of alloreactive T cells. Since HLA class II molecules are predominantly expressed on hematopoietic cells, HLA class II mismatched alloSCT and DLI may more selectively induce GvL reactivity without inducing severe GvHD. In this study, we investigated the in vivo immunogenicity of established B-ALL or CML-BP by comparing the anti-tumor responses after fully HLA matched versus HLA class II mismatched DLI in a NOD/scid mouse model. Mice engrafted with primary B-ALL and CML-BP were treated with DLI from HLA matched (12/12 match) or HLA class II mismatched, but HLA class I matched donors. In mice engrafted with B-ALL or CML-BP, treatment with HLA matched DLI induced expansion of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood, but leukemic cells were only delayed in growth, and not eliminated. In contrast, after HLA class II mismatched DLI, leukemic cells rapidly disappeared upon emergence of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood. To analyze the specificity of the T cells, we clonally isolated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from bone marrow and spleens of mice after treatment with DLI. All T cell clones were tested for recognition of patient leukemic cells, donor EBV transformed B cells (EBV-LCL) and murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells in IFNg ELISA. Isolated CD8+ and CD4+ T cell clones recognized either patient leukemic cells or murine cells, indicating that the T cell clones were either leukemia-reactive or xeno-reactive. After HLA matched DLI, only 2 of the 106 CD4+ T cell clones, and none of the 183 CD8+ T cell clones, recognized patient leukemic cells. The majority of isolated CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones were xeno-reactive, as demonstrated by specific recognition of murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells, or non-reactive against any of the tested target cells. In contrast, after HLA class II mismatched DLI, 95 of the 322 CD4+ T cell clones specifically recognized patient leukemic cells. These leukemia-reactive CD4+ T cell clones were shown to be restricted by the mismatched HLA-DRB3, -DQB1 and \u2013DPB1 alleles of the patient. None of the 49 CD8+ T cell clones were leukemia-reactive, but a significant number of CD8+ T cell clones and remaining CD4+ were xeno-reactive. In conclusion, our data show that HLA class II mismatched, but HLA class I matched, DLI is far more effective in inducing anti-tumor reactivity as compared to HLA matched DLI, whereas the in vivo capacity of both DLI's to induce allo-immune reactivity based on the induction of xeno-reactive T cells was similar. Our study emphasizes the necessity of HLA class II disparity for efficient in vivo induction of HLA class II mediated anti-tumor immunity against poorly immunogenic B-ALL and CML-BP in NOD/scid mice. We therefore hypothesize that use of HLA class II mismatched as compared to HLA matched alloSCT and DLI, despite an increased risk for GvHD, may improve the outcome for patients with HLA class II positive high risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
