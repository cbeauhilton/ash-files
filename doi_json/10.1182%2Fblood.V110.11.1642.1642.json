    "abstract_text": "Background: Hematological cancer patients are at an increased risk for VTE (RR range = 12\u201332). However, whether VTE risk among such patients can be further stratified is uncertain. Objective: To test hematological cancer type, stage, stage progression and chemotherapy as potential risk factors for VTE among active hematological cancer patients after controlling for other previously-identified VTE risk factors. Methods: Using the resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, Mayo Clinic Master Diagnostic Index and Mayo Clinic Tumor Registry, we identified all Olmsted County, MN residents with active hematological cancer over the 28-year period, 1973\u20132000. From this prevalence cohort, we identified 86 patients with no prior VTE (controls) who were matched on age and date of hematological cancer diagnosis to 86 hematological cancer patients with incident VTE over the same time frame (cases). For all cases and controls, we reviewed the complete medical records in the community for baseline and hematological cancer-related characteristics. Hematological cancers were re-staged at the dates of the cancer and VTE diagnosis. We tested these characteristics as potential risk factors for VTE in active hematological cancer using conditional logistic regression. Results: In an initial multivariate analysis that included body mass index (BMI), hospitalization, and any infection or central venous catheter placement within 90 days prior to the VTE event, VTE was significantly associated with hospitalization (OR=6.70; p<0.001), and marginally associated with any infection (OR=2.18; p=0.09). After adjusting for the above variables, chemotherapy administered within the preceding 90 days was significantly associated with VTE (OR=4.25; p=0.02), while stage progression was marginally associated (OR=4.79; p=0.10). Compared to all other hematological cancer types, acute leukemia (OR=5.95; p=0.01) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (OR=2.61; p=0.01) were associated with VTE. However, after adjusting for BMI, hospitalization, any infection and central venous catheter, only non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma was independently associated with VTE (OR=3.79, p=0.009), while acute leukemia was not (OR=2.66, p=0.35). Conclusions: Hematological cancer type (in particular, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and possibly acute leukemia), recent hospitalization, recent chemotherapy, and possibly stage progression and recent infection, are risk factors for VTE among patients with active hematological cancer."
