    "abstract_text": "Mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) is characterized by an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis with a median survival of only 3 to 4 years. High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is an effective treatment strategy for MCL demonstrating significantly prolongs progression free survival (PFS) when compared to IFNa maintenance therapy of patients in first remission. We have previously shown that absolute lymphocyte count at day 15 (ALC-15) after ASCT is an independent prognostic factor for survival in hematologic malignancies (non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin\u2019s disease, multiple myeloma, primary amyloidosis, acute myelogenous leukemia) and breast cancer. The study of ALC-15 after ASCT as a prognosis factor in NHL included different subtypes of lymphomas. The relationship of ALC-15 after ASCT in patients with MCL has not been specifically addressed. Herein we present data evaluating the impact of early lymphocyte recovery (ALC-15) in patients undergoing ASCT for MCL. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 42 consecutive patients (9 females and 33 males) with MCL who underwent ASCT at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester from 1993 to 2005. Based on our previous studies, the ALC-15 threshold was set at 500 cells/\u03bcL. The median patient age at transplant was 57 years (range, 37\u201371) and the median follow-up after ASCT was 25 months (range, 2\u2013106 months). The median overall (OS) and PFS times were significantly better for the 24 patients that achieved an ALC-15 \u2265 500 cells/mL compared with 18 patients with ALC-15 < 500 cells/\u03bcL (not reached versus 30 months, P < 0.01 and not reached versus 16 months, P < 0.0006, respectively). Multivariate analysis adjusting for other prognostic factors suggests that ALC-15 is an independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS. ALC-15 \u2265 500 cells/mL is associated with significantly improved clinical outcomes following ASCT in patients with MCL.",
