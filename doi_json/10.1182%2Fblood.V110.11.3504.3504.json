    "abstract_text": "Background : Peripheral blood (PB) is sometimes used in place of bone marrow (BM) for cytogenetic studies during the evaluation of hematologic malignancies. We looked for clinical or laboratory features that predict success in obtaining analyzable metaphases during PB chromosome studies. Methods: The Mayo Clinic cytogenetics database was queried to identify adult cases (age > 18 years) with suspected or established hematologic neoplasm in whom PB cytogenetic studies were performed. Success defined as the acquisition of at least two metaphases, was correlated with clinical and laboratory information corresponding to the time of the PB cytogenetic study. Results : A total of 242 PB cytogenetic studies were performed: clinical diagnosis was a myeloid neoplasm in 169 patients (70%), lymphoid neoplasm in 50 (21%), and unexplained cytopenia or leukocytosis in 23 (9%). The 169 myeloid cases included 59 patients with either primary (n=39) or post-polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia (post-PV/ET MF) myelofibrosis (n=20), 42 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 15 with chronic myeloid leukemia, 9 with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 8 with ET, 6 with PV, and 30 with other MPDs. The 50 lymphoid cases included 19 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 12 with lymphoma, 11 with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and 8 with plasma cell proliferative disorders. PB cytogenetic studies resulted in at least two analyzable metaphases (median 20, range 2\u201331) in 142 of the 242 study cases (59%); in univariate analysis, this was predicted by the specific clinical diagnosis (p<0.0001), presence and degree of circulating myeloid progenitor cells (p<0.0001), higher leukocyte count (p<0.001), lower platelet count (p=0.003), lower hemoglobin level (p=0.002), and presence of palpable splenomegaly (p=0.002). In multivariable analysis, only the presence of circulating myeloid progenitor cells sustained its significance and this was consistent with the high yield rates seen in PMF (80%), post-PV/ET MF (85%), AML (76%), and ALL (80%) as opposed to the low rates seen in ET (0%) and PV (2%). In 104 cases, BM cytogenetic studies were performed within one month of the PB cytogenetic studies; an abnormal BM cytogenetic finding was another independent predictor of a successful PB study (p=0.002). Conclusion : PB cytogenetic studies are most appropriate in diseases characterized by presence of circulating myeloid progenitors or blasts (e.g. PMF, AML, ALL); the yield otherwise is too small to be cost-effective. The current study also suggests a higher likelihood of a successful PB cytogenetic study in the presence of an abnormal bone marrow karyotype."
