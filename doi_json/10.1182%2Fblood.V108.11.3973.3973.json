    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized clinically by thrombotic events and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLA) and/or lupus anticoagulant (LA). It is frequently associated with thrombocytopenia and anti-platelet antibodies have been implicated by some. However the roles of anti-platelet antibodies in APS have not been elucidated. We previously reported that platelet activation, but not endothelial activation, was associated with thrombosis in aPLA+ patients [ Blood, 104:143a, 2004] but the cause of platelet activation was not addressed. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of anti-platelet antibodies in APS patients, as well as platelet and endothelial activation. Material and Methods: We evaluated 47 patients with primary APS. Anti-platelet antibodies against GP IIb/IIIa (CD41b), GP Ib/IX (CD 42b) and GP IV (CD36) for IgG and IgM class were measured by PAICA assay [ Thromb Haemost  76 : 1820 , 1996 ]. We also measured platelet and endothelial activation markers by flow cytometry: CD62P on platelets, CD31+/CD42+ platelet microparticles (PMP), and CD31+/CD42- endothelial microparticles (EMP). Results: Of the 47 patients, 34 (72%) were positive for at least one anti-platelet antibody. Looking first at IgG, 18/34 (53%) were positive for GP IV; 17/34 (50%) for GP IIb/IIIa; and 16/34 (47%) for GP Ib/IX. IgM antibodies were 47% (14/30) for GP Ib/IX, 38%(13/34) for GP IIb/IIIa, and 24% (8/33) for GP IV. Platelet and endothelial markers were significantly more common in the anti-platelet antibodies positive group: 40% vs. 21% for CD62P, 40% vs. 28.5% for EMP, and 23% vs. 5% for PMP, respectively. We found that CD62P associated significantly with IgM anti-GP IIb/IIIa (p< 0.05), and PMP with IgM anti-GP IIb/IIIa (p< 0.05), and IgM anti-GP IV (p< 0.05). Conclusions: Anti-platelet antibodies are common in APS, confirming previous reports. We found that anti-platelet antibodies IgM anti-GP IIb/IIIa, and IgM anti-GP IV were often associated with platelet activation, suggesting that these antibodies may activate platelets to play an important role in the thrombogenesis of APS. These antibodies were also associated with endothelial activation. It remains to be determined which antibodies, APLA and/or anti-platelet antibodies, play a dominant role in the activation of platelet or endothelial cells and contibute most to the pathogenesis of thrombosis in APS."
