    "abstract_text": "In severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) patients and mice with Growth factor independent-1 (Gfi1) loss of function, arrested progenitors are suspended in a hyperproliferative state while terminal granulpoiesis is blocked. SCN patients are at increased risk for the development of acute myeloid leukemia. We demonstrate that Gfi1 directly targets HoxA9 , Pbx1 and Meis1 during normal myelopoiesis. Gfi1 \u2212/\u2212 progenitors exhibit elevated levels of HoxA9, Pbx1 and Meis1, exaggerated HoxA9-Pbx1-Meis1 activity, and increased persistence in vivo and in vitro . Limiting HoxA9 alleles corrects, in a dose dependent manner, in vivo and in vitro phenotypes observed with loss of Gfi1. Moreover, in a manner conserved in Drosophila anterior/posterior patterning, we demonstrate that these factors can compete for occupancy of DNA sequences encoding composite Gfi1-HoxA9-Pbx1-Meis1 binding sites. Finally, the expression of Gfi1 and HoxA9 are inverse and stratify human myeloid leukemias, suggesting a role for HoxA9- Gfi1 antagonism in human AML. In agreement with this, a myeloproliferative disorder progresses into a rapid, lethal and transplantable myeloid leukemia in a Gfi1 \u2212/\u2212 setting. We conclude that the lifespan and oncogenic transformation of hematopoietic progenitor cells is regulated through a conserved competition between Gfi1 and HoxA9-Pbx1-Meis1."
