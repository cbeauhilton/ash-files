    "abstract_text": "Background : Systemic mastocytosis (SM) has a varied presentation ranging from indolent forms with limited morbidity over many years to the rapidly fatal mast cell leukemia (MCL). This heterogeneity complicates clinical decision making regarding choice and timing of therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of SM, and to refine risk stratification within SM sub-groups to facilitate clinical decision making. Information on KIT D816V and JAK2 V617F mutation analysis and clinical correlates is also provided. Methods : Patient records in the institutional electronic database from January 1976 to October 2007 were reviewed and SM patients 18 years of age or older identified; the date of diagnosis ranged from July 1964 to October 2007. Only those patients where diagnosis was confirmed by bone marrow (BM) histology were included in the analysis. KIT D816V mutation analysis was performed by DNA sequencing. JAK2 V617F was screened by allele-specific quantitative PCR analysis. Results : i. Clinical characteristics at presentation: A total of 342 SM patients were identified (154 female; median age at diagnosis=57 years; range 19 to 87 years). Per the 2001 WHO classification, 159 had indolent SM (ISM; median age=49 years), 41 aggressive SM (ASM; median age=65 years), 138 SM with associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease (SM-AHNMD; median age=65 years), and 4 MCL (median age=55 years) (p-value for age 1500/mcl) \u2013 31% and 22% with SM-AHNMD and ASM, respectively, versus 3% with ISM (p<0.0001); 12 of 23 patients (52%) with eosinophilia who were tested carried the FIP1L1-PDGFRA mutation. Serum tryptase (normal 200 ng/mL). ii. Disease course and prognostic factors After a median follow-up of 20.7 months (range=0\u2013417), 153 deaths were recorded. 17 patients (5%) transformed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n=14) or MCL (n=3), most frequently with SM-AHNMD (11% versus 0% for ISM; p5%; p=0.004). A similar analysis in ISM identified anemia (p=0.04), hypoalbuminemia (P=0.002), and BM MC \u2265 30% (p=0.03) as independent predictors of inferior survival; the corresponding parameters in ASM were age at diagnosis (p=0.002) and history of weight loss (p=0.003). iii) KIT D816V and JAK2 V617F analysis Archived bone marrow was available in 165 patients for KIT D816V and JAK2 V617F analysis. By DNA sequencing, overall KIT D816V detection rate was 28%: ISM 20%, ASM 29%, SM-AHNMD 33% (p=0.4). In patients with ASM (p=0.003) and SM-AHNMD (p=0.001), detection of KIT D816V was associated with inferior survival. Greater than 1% (range 1\u201357) JAK2 V617F allele burden was detected in 6 patients (4%); all belonged to SM-AHNMD including 4 with non-MC lineage myeloproliferative neoplasm. Conclusions : The current study confirms the prognostic value of the WHO subclassification of SM and identifies advanced age, weight loss, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and excess BM blasts as additional adverse prognostic factors. In ISM, presence of anemia, hypoalbuminemia, or BM MC \u2265 30% is associated with inferior survival. In ASM and SM-AHNMD, BM KIT D816V allele burden might influence survival. JAK2 V617F is rare in SM and when found, it is almost always in the context of SM-AHNMD.",
