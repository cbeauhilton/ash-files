    "abstract_text": "We have recently demonstrated that there is variation in the intrinsic sensitivity of de novo CML patients to imatinib. Patients with low intrinsic sensitivity to imatinib, have a lower probability of achieving major molecular response by 12 months. Intrinsic sensitivity was determined pre-therapy using western blot, with the IC50 imatinib defined as the dose of drug required in vitro to reduce phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Crkl (p-Crkl) by 50%. In the current study we show that the observed variation in IC50 imatinib between patients can be explained by the intracellular concentration of imatinib. In 16 de novo CML patients the IC50 imatinib strongly correlated (R 2 = \u22120.6, p = 0.002) with the intracellular concentration of 14 C-labelled imatinib after 2 hours exposure at 37\u00b0C. In keeping with the notion that the organic cation transporter Oct-1 is responsible for imatinib influx, the addition of Prazosin, an inhibitor of Oct-1, to 14 C imatinib experiments greatly reduced the inter-patient variation in intracellular concentration.

There was also less inter-patient variation in AMN107 IC50 (range 0.07uM) when compared to imatinib (range 3.1uM). In contrast to imatinib, there is no correlation between IC50 AMN107 and the intracellular concentration of drug achieved in 14 C-uptake studies (R 2 = 0.337, p>0.05). Further to this the addition of prazosin had no effect on influx of AMN107 suggesting that Oct-1 may not be a rate limiting determinant of intracellular drug concentration. In conclusion, variable Oct-1 mediated influx of imatinib may explain the heterogeneous IC50 imatinib values we have observed in de novo CML patients. Oct-1 mediated influx may therefore be a key determinant of molecular response to imatinib. The causes of inter-patient variability in Oct-1 mediated influx requires further investigation. By contrast, poor Oct-1 mediated uptake is unlikely to have any impact on response to AMN107. This may be of relevance to patients with low intrinsic sensitivity to imatinib.",
