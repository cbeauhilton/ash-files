    "abstract_text": "Therapy with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) changed the fate of Philadelphia-positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). At present, the therapeutic strategy aims to improve the management of the disease and the quality of life of the patients. In July 2015, we started a prospective multicentric randomized trial with the aim to validate the policy of the intermittent de-escalation treatment and to explore the impact of this strategy on the Quality of Life. To this purpose, CML patients older than 60 years in stable (\u22652 years) MR3.0 or MR4.0 molecular response were randomized to receive a FIXED intermittent TKIs regimen (one month ON and one month OFF), as previously published (Russo D, Blood 2013; Russo D, BCJ 2015), versus a PROGRESSIVE intermittent TKIs regimen (one month ON and one month OFF for the 1 st year; one month ON and two months OFF for the 2 nd year; one month ON and three months OFF from the 3 rd year) (OPTkIMA study, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02326311). Molecular monitoring was performed according to the 2015 ELN guidelines, every 3 months by RT-PCR on peripheral blood (Baccarani M, Blood 2013 ) . In case of MR3.0 (MMR) loss, checked in two monthly consecutive RT-PCR analysis, patients were planned to exit the study and to resume TKIs daily. This first interim report have been focused on the patients who, by intention to treat, have completed the first year of the study for an historical comparison with the previous INTERIM trial (Russo D, Blood 2013; Russo D, BCJ 2015). During the first year, both the patients randomized in the FIXED and in the PROGRESSIVE arms were given the TKIs treatment one month ON and one month OFF. Up to June 2018, 177 patients have been enrolled by 26 Italian Hematological Centers (first patient randomized in July 2015) and 121/177 patients (68%) completed the first year of OPTkIMA study. The median age was 71 years (range 60-89) and 64% of the patients were belonging to the Sokal intermediate/high risk goup. 96/121 (79%), 14/121 (12%) and 11/121 (9%) patients were receiving imatinib (IMA), nilotinib (NILO) and dasatinib (DAS), at the time of enrollment. Overall, 59/121 (49%) and 62/121 (51%) patients have been randomized in the FIXED and PROGRESSIVE arm, respectively. 41/62 patients (66%) randomly assigned to the PROGRESSIVE arm have entered the second year of therapy. 34/121 patients (28%) went out of the study during the first year. The reasons for protocol discontinuation were: informed consent withdrawn (2 cases), second cancer (4 cases), loss of MR3.0 (28 cases). (Table 1). Among the 28 patients who lost the MMR, 17 and 11 were in MR4.0 and MR3.0, respectively, when they were enrolled into the study. Thus the probability of loosing the MR3.0 while on OPTkIMA was 21,7% at one year (Figure 1). All the 28 patients resumed TKIs continuously and all obtained at least the MR3.0 response, within 6 months and are currently included in the study follow up. The intermittent treatment was well tolerated, with 4 serious adverse events (1 appendicitis, 1 atrial fibrillation, 1 cardiac failure, 1 hip fracture) and 3 adverse events (1 diarrohea, 1 pruritus and 1 fever), none of which have been considered treatement-related. None of the patients experienced the TKI withdrawn syndrome. According to this first interim report, we found that a policy of intermittent TKIs administration in elderly patients is safe and well tolerated. Analysis of patient-reported QoL outcomes is ongoing and will further add information on the overall treatment effectivness of the new PROGRESSIVE intermittent TKI administration. After the 1 st year, 28/121 patients (23%) lost MR3.0 and all of them re-gained the major molecular response within 6 months from resumption of continuous treatment. The probability of MR3.0 loss while on OPTkIMA at 1 year was 21,7% and this is quite comparable with the 20% MR3.0 loss observed in the previous INTERIM trial (Russo D, Blood 2013; Russo D, BCJ 2015) .
