    "abstract_text": "Introduction Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that infects >95% of the human population and is associated with a substantial risk of cancer development. Most infections in children and adolescents are asymptomatic or result in infectious mononucleosis; however, in some patients, EBV is associated with various hematological malignancies including Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. EBV infection is also present in a portion of epithelial cell neoplasms such as gastric cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Despite the large population risk of cancer associated with EBV, it is poorly understood why only a small subset of EBV-infected individuals develop neoplasms, while others do not. Patients and Methods We designed a target enrichment system to capture several EBV strains including the Akata strain, which is responsible for the majority of EBV infections in Japan. We analyzed the genomes of EBV strains in 139 patients with various EBV-associated diseases and 17 EBV-positive cell lines. Next-generation sequencing reads were aligned to the Akata reference genome to analyze nucleotide variations, copy number alterations, and structural variations including sequence insertions in the human genome. The institutional review board of Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine approved this study. Results We identified a median of 645 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the EBV genomes, 78% of which affected coding sequences. SNVs in coding sequences were significantly biased toward synonymous variants, suggesting negative selection pressure. The SNVs detected in noncoding sequences were enriched in two evolutionarily conserved viral noncoding RNAs (EBER1 and EBER2), particularly in the PAX5-binding domain of EBER2. However, most SNVs identified in the EBV genome do not seem to affect the development of neoplasms, as hierarchical clustering of EBV genomes from neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases based on SNVs revealed no significant association between the EBV strain and disease type. In addition to SNVs, we identified frequent intragenic deletions in the EBV genomes of patients with EBV-positive DLBCL (10/14, 71%), extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (10/23, 43%), chronic active EBV infection (27/77, 35%), and other EBV-associated neoplasms (2/7). Such deletions were also identified in several EBV-associated cell lines (6/17), but not in non-neoplastic diseases such as infectious mononucleosis (0/4) and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (0/14), suggesting a unique role of these mutations in the neoplastic proliferation of EBV-infected cells. Frequent deletions were detected in Bam HI A rightward transcripts microRNA clusters (31/156), which suppress viral transcription factors ( BZLF1 and BRLF1 ) required for the lytic reactivation of EBV. Deletions also were associated with several genes essential for virus production (20/156). These observed deletions are thought to upregulate lytic cycle-associated genes, some of which benefit neoplasms by inducing genomic instability and immune escape and mitigate cell damage caused by the production of viral particles. In fact, deletion of one essential gene, BALF5 , resulted in upregulation of the lytic cycle and promotion of lymphomagenesis in a xenograft model. Discussion Although the essential roles of several latency-associated genes, such as LMP-1 and EBNA-2, in EBV-mediated immortalization and transformation of human lymphocytes have long been discussed, our finding raises the possibility that lytic cycle-associated genes also contribute to lymphomagenesis. This agrees with reports that lytic cycle-associated genes are expressed in Burkitt lymphoma, DLBCL, and chronic active EBV infection, and that BZLF1 -deficient lymphoblastoid cells exhibit significantly impaired tumorigenicity in mice. In addition, essential gene deletions lead to the protection of EBV-infected cells from lysis. Further studies are warranted to exploit these findings for the design of novel therapeutics for EBV-associated neoplasms.
