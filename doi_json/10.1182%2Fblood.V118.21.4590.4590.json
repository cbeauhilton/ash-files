    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4590 Objective: To investigate the function of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in the interaction between chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells and bone marrow stromal cells. Method: The expression of NF-\u03baB family members at mRNA and protein levels were examined by quantitative RT-PCR and Western bloting analyses individualy, and the differences between CLL-human bone marrow stromal cell (hBMSC) and non-CLL-hBMSC were investigated with the methods above. Cell death was measured by flow cytometry analysis after B-CLL cells were co-cultured with hBMSC and treated with proteasome inhibitors. The changes of NF-\u03baB expression at the protein levels were examined by Western bloting after co-culture experiment. Result: The expression of NF-\u03baB family members turned out to be heterogeneous at both mRNA and protein levels in B-CLL cells, and the members demonstrated a different \u03baB-DNA binding activities. The mRNA expression of NF-\u03baB family members in B-CLL cells was shown at a remarkable higher level than that of the controls. The relative mRNA expression of relA was 0.0214\u00b10.012, whereas it was 0.0130\u00b10.012 for the controls of CD19 positive cells. The relative mRNA expression of p50 and p52 were 66.0860\u00b121.649 and 0.0208\u00b10.011 respectively, and the corresponding expression of CD19 positive cells were 24.8440\u00b19.749 and 0.0065\u00b10.002. The differences were statistically significant. There was no notable difference between CLL-hBMSC and Non-CLL-hBMSC. hBMSC protected B-CLL cells against the proteasome inhibitors and facilitated the survival of B-CLL cells. Conclusion: NF-\u03baB expression is heterogeneous in bone marrow B-CLL cells. There is no significant difference between CLL-hBMSC and non-CLL-hBMSC. hBMSC can protect the survival of B-CLL cells dependending on the endogenous NF-\u03baB activity. hBMSC can increase the drug resistance of B-CLL cells to proteasome inhibitors.
