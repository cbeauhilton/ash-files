    "abstract_text": "Fludarabine (F)-based combination chemotherapy regimens are highly effective in a range of indolent lymphoproliferative disorders. Despite the prevalence of such disorders in older patients, the deliverability of these regimes in patients aged >= 60 has not been assessed. We analysed the delivery and toxicity of three F-based regimens, all using F 25 mg/m2/dx3 q28d, in 82 adults aged >= 60 years, and compared this with the same regimens in 99 adults aged < 60. The sample comprised 66 patients (32 >= 60) treated with F and cyclophosphamide (C; 250 mg/m2/dx3); 29 with F and mitoxantrone (M; 10 mg/m2 x1; 12 >= 60); and 86 with FC and rituximab (R; 375 mg/m2 x1; 38 >= 60). 349 cycles in older patients were compared with 393 cycles in younger patients for haematologic nadirs, infectious complications and organ toxicity. Both groups received a median of 4 cycles, although older patients were more likely to require dose reduction (4.3% of cycles versus 1.2%, P < 0.001) and growth factor support (3.8% versus 1.8%, P=0.01). The cohorts were well matched for baseline characteristics other than age. Overall, older patients had a slightly higher rate of infections (18%/cycle versus 15%/cycle), though this was not statistically significant (P = 0.28). For severe (grade >=3) infections the difference was minimal: 6% versus 7% (P< 0.5). The rates of neutropenia < 1.0 and 0.5 were 13% and 22% versus 11% and 20% for older and younger patients, respectively (all P values>0.1). The rates of thrombocytopenia < 100 and < 50 were 21% and 5% versus 16% and 5% for older and younger cohorts (all P values < 0.1). Other organ toxicities were uncommon, and showed no difference between age groups. Treatment-related mortality in both cohorts was  0.5). Comparison within the cohort aged over 60 showed that those aged 70 and over were at higher risk of haematological and infectious toxicity. 82 cycles delivered to 23 patients aged >= 70 were compared with 267 cycles delivered to 61 patients aged 60 to 69. The rate of infection for those over 70 was 25% versus 16% in those aged 60 to 69, though this was not statistically significant (P=0.07). For severe infections (grade >=3), the rates were 13% versus 6% (P=0.03), while rates of neutropenia < 0.5 and thrombocytopenia < 50 were 32% and 15% versus 8% and 3% for those >= 70 and 60 to 69 respectively (all P values > 0.001). These results demonstrate that F-based regimens are well tolerated and can safely be delivered to most older patients, with a modestly increased rate of infectious morbidity, but no increased treatment-related mortality. However, for patients aged >=70 the increased rate of toxicity mandates careful patient selection and monitoring.",
