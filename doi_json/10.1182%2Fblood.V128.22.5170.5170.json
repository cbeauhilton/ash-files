    "abstract_text": "Context: The 5-year survival rate for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is 26.6%. The prognosis of patients with adverse events such as older age or unfavorable risk cytogenetics remains poor, even for those who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. AML is a heterogeneous disease and novel N-of-1 clinical trial designs may offer benefit to individuals compared to conventional clinical trials by offering improved utilization of investigational chemotherapy regimens. Precision medicine based assays that reveal a deeper understanding of the cancer biology and potential for novel therapeutics may improve survival in the future. Objective: The goal of the clinical trial on which this patient was enrolled, Individualized Treatment for Relapsed/Refractory Acute Leukemia Based on Chemosensitivity and Genomics/Gene Expression Data (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT01872819) was to determine feasibility of a study that utilized results of comprehensive mutation analysis and an in vitro high throughput functional assay to choose treatment for individual patients with refractory AML. Feasibility was defined as initiating chosen treatment within 21 days. A secondary objective was to achieve a response (cytoreduction or at least partial response) greater than that expected for comparable refractory patient populations with other salvage regimens. Design, Setting, and Patient: A single center enrolled individuals who had failed at least 2 inductions at initial diagnosis or >1 salvage regimen for relapsed AML. Patients could receive any FDA approved drug or combination regimen based on molecular analysis and high throughput drug sensitivity assay. A 58 year old female was enrolled into this protocol with MECOM (EVI1) rearranged, Monosomy 7 refractory AML. Methods and Main Outcome Measures: The patient had various assays performed on her samples, including next generation sequencing and a high throughput in vitro assay that analyzed enriched blast samples for sensitivity to 150 drugs or drug combinations. MyAML \u2122 , a next generation sequencing panel, analyzed 194 genes including breakpoint hotspot loci with long paired end sequencing and high depth that optimized detection of large insertion and deletions and other structural variants found in AML at low variant allele frequency. Results: The MyAML assay detected multiple variants including: NRAS:c.38G>A; p.Gly13Asp VAF = 100%, RUNX1:c.494_495ins; p.165_R166ins VAF = 42%, WT1:c.1149_1150ins; p.E384Pfs*5 VAF=38%. Fusions were also detected: t(13;17)(q12.2;q11.2), t(8;13)(q21.13;q12.2), and t(9;12)(q32;p13.2) which involved FLT3 novel fusions. FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITD) or tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) variants were not detected. The assay also detected the Monosomy 7 and confirmed the t(2;3) as a THADA-MECOM (EVI1) fusion to the nucleotide breakpoint. These variants involved activated signaling, myeloid transcription factor and DNA demethylation pathways. The high throughput drug sensitivity assay identified sensitivity to kinase inhibitors such as the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (IC50 8.1 X 10e-9 M), Flt3 inhibitor staurosporine (IC50 1.4 X 10e-8 M) and Abl kinase inhibitor ponatinib (IC50 2.7 X 10e-8 M). Insurance coverage for these agents was not able to be obtained as this indication would be considered off label. However, based on the FLT3 fusion we identified using MyAML, we decided to treat the patient with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib that we were able to obtain through a patient assistance program. This novel case is the first demonstration of a FLT3 fusion detection with a drug sensitivity assay suggesting that kinase inhibitors with multiple targets might be suitable for this type of variant. Conclusion: Specialized assays designed to identify clonal and subclonal architecture of genes associated with specific diseases can reveal variants that present therapeutic options not currently utilized for high risk patients, suggesting broader use of this approach could improve current clinical outcomes.
