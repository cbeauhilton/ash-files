    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3411 Background: Dose of therapy and time to response may be different in the elderly as compared to younger patients with CML. This has been reported previously for interferon \u03b1 (Berger et al., Leukemia 2003). For imatinib, contradictory results have been presented (Rosti et al. Haematologica 2007, Guliotta et al. Blood 2009). Aims: An analysis comparing dose-response relationship in patients more or less than 65 years (y) of age is warranted. Methods: We analysed the German CML-Study IV, a randomized 5-arm trial to optimize imatinib therapy by combination, dose escalation and transplantation. Patients older and younger than 65y randomized to imatinib 400 mg (IM400) or 800 mg (IM800) were compared with regard to time to hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular remissions, imatinib dose, adverse events (AEs) and overall survival (OS). Results: From July 2002 to April 2009, 1311 patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase were randomized, 623 patients were evaluable, 311 patients for treatment with IM400 and 312 for IM800. 84 (27%) and 66 (21%), respectively, were older than 65 years. All patients were evaluable for hematologic, 578 (140 >65y and 438 65y was 94.7% and for patients <65y was 96.1%. Some differences were observed in the safety analyses. 530 patients (IM400: 278, IM800: 252) were evaluated on common toxicity criteria (WHO). Some hematologic AEs were documented slightly more often in the elderly than in the younger patients: for IM400 anemia grade 1\u20132 (60 vs. 42%) and leukopenia grade 3\u20134 (5.6 vs. 1.4%) and for IM800 anemia grade 1\u20134 (64 vs.47% and 7.2 vs. 5.7%) and thrombocytopenia grade 3\u20134 (9.3 vs. 7.1%). Non hematologic AEs were more prominent in IM800 and were mainly gastrointestinal symptoms (IM400: 33 vs. 31%, IM800: 48 and 44%) and edema (IM400: 28 vs. 29%, IM800: 35 vs. 50%). There was no difference for grade 3/4 non-hematological AEs in older patients in both groups. Conclusions: Imatinib 400 mg and 800 mg are well tolerated also in the elderly. The IM800 dosage was more tolerability-adapted for the elderly, but there was no difference in reaching a CCR and MMR in contrast to the IM400 where a significantly slower response was detected in the elderly. Whether this difference is clinically relevant has yet to be determined. Updated results will be presented.
