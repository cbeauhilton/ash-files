    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients with AML harboring FLT3 mutations have poor clinical outcomes. Furthermore, FLT3 mutations frequently co-occur with other driver mutations, such as NPM1 with DNMT3A, WT1, and RUNX1, that are associated with poor prognosis. Crenolanib is a highly potent and specific type-I FLT3 inhibitor, which has shown promising safety and efficacy in combination with chemotherapy. Here we report the outcomes of newly diagnosed FLT3 mutated AML patients treated with crenolanib and intensive 7 + 3 based chemotherapy (NCT02283177) by baseline genomic profile. Methods: Patients were treated on clinical trial with 7+3 induction chemotherapy combined with crenolanib, consolidation with high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) combined with crenolanib, and/or allo-HCT followed by crenolanib maintenance. Of 44 pts enrolled and treated, 36 had sequencing performed at baseline. The median survival follow-up for these patients was 20.7 months with data cut off July 25, 2018. A post hoc analysis was performed to assess the impact of genomic profile on patient outcomes using published data from the German-Austrian AML Study Group as a historical control. Results: Concurrent FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and DNMT3A mutations (\"triple mutant\") were present in 10 pts. These patients demonstrated improved OS with crenolanib treatment compared with historical controls. Similarly, patients with FLT3-ITD and WT1 mutations (n = 6) showed dramatically improved outcomes, with no deaths occurring by 18 months. Patients with FLT3 (ITD or TKD) and RUNX1 mutations (n = 10) also had improved OS. Conclusions: This analysis suggests that adding a potent pan-FLT3 inhibitor can overcome the poor prognostic implication of adverse mutations co-occurring with mutated FLT3. These data support the combination of crenolanib with chemotherapy to improve the overall outcome of FLT3 mutated AML with diverse mutational profiles. Hence, a randomized trial has been initiated of standard chemotherapy combined with either crenolanib or midostaurin in newly diagnosed patients with FLT3-mutant AML (NCT03258931). Table.
