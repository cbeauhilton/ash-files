    "abstract_text": "Introduction FDG-PET imaging is a powerful predictor of both positive and negative outcome of initial therapy for DLBCL. Existing data on the utility of PET to predict outcome of ASCT have included a range of histological subtypes, limiting its direct applicability to the setting of DLBCL. Methods Data from 41 consecutive patients who had PET scans immediately prior to undergoing ASCT for treatment of first relapse of de novo DLBCL were analysed. We compared the clinical characteristics, event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of those with residual FDG avid disease (n=21) against those without FDG avid disease (n=20). Results The median age was 53(18\u201371). Patient characteristics are shown in the table. At 3 years, the OS was 67(\u00b18)%, and the EFS was the 62(\u00b18)%. EFS for PET positive patients was 38(\u00b112)% vs 79(\u00b19%) for PET negative patients (p=0.04). OS was 37(\u00b117%) vs 81(\u00b110%) (p=0.08) respectively. Conclusion Excellent EFS and OS can be anticipated from ASCT when undertaken in those who have achieved a PET negative remission following salvage chemotherapy. Conversely, failure to achieve a PET negative remission after salvage chemotherapy in relapsed DLBCL predicts for a poorer, but not irretrievable outcome after ASCT, suggesting that a proportion of PET positive patients can be successfully salvaged by either ASCT or post-ASCT salvage therapies.
