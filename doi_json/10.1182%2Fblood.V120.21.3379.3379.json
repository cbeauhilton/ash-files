    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3379 Background: The literature in the past has recommended pre-operative (PRE-O) coagulation screening only when indicated by history or physical exam. Despite these recommendations, surgeons continue to order PT and PTT prior to surgery, especially in children, because they have often not been hemostatically challenged. We evaluated the usefulness of screening tests in identifying significant bleeding risk and associated cost. Methods: We performed a retrospective audit on children referred to the hemophilia center sent for further evaluation of abnormal PT and PTT on PRE-O screening. We reviewed 62 patients who had 80 procedures, out of which 70 procedures were evaluable with complete data. Age, personal and family history of bleeding, coagulation tests, PRE-O and post-operative (PO) treatment, and immediate PO bleeding were assessed. Results: The most common procedure that led to PRE-O screening was tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy at 61% (49/80). Other procedures included orthopedic, GI, oral, dental extractions, and myringotomies. Only 2.5% (2/80) were cardiac procedures. The mean patient age was 6 years (range 1\u201316). 55% (34/62) had no personal or family history of bleeding. 22.5% (14/62) had a family history of mild bleeding such as epistaxis or menorrhagia. 8% (5/62) had a family history of major bleeding disorders such as Von Willebrand disease (VWD) or hemophilia. 14.5% (9/62) had a personal history of bleeding, mild or major. The most common abnormal screening test was the PT at 40% (25/62). 27% (17/62) had an abnormal PTT (3.2% \\(262\\) with a significantly abnormal PTT above 50). 22.5% (14/62) were referred for abnormal PT/PTT. 8% (5/62) with an abnormal PT and/or PTT corrected on repeat studies. The remaining 9.6% (6/62) were referred for other reasons such as positive family or personal history and a high risk procedure. Additional coagulation tests ordered because of prolonged PT or PTT varied and included additional factor assays ( Table 1 ). The mean cost of additional testing was >$1000.

PRE-O, 5 patients received support with either Humate P, Stimate, Amicar, or DDAVP, 4 with a diagnosis of VWD and 1 with Jacobsen Syndrome; 3 of these patients received PO Amicar. PO, 69/70 procedures were completed with minimal (2\u201345 mL) bleeding. Only 1/70 procedures had significant PO bleeding, despite normal tests. This patient did not have any significant immediate PO bleeding, but had delayed bleeding reported at day 7 requiring cauterization. No other cases of delayed PO bleeding were reported to our clinic. Conclusion: In patients who undergo routine screening by laboratory testing only, the most common abnormality found was a prolonged PT. Subsequent workup of patients with abnormal screening tests identified factor VII or factor XII deficiencies most frequently. Only one patient with abnormal PT/PTT was diagnosed with a significant bleeding disorder, VWD. Major bleeding occurred rarely. This study demonstrates that the cost of extensive PRE-O coagulation testing is high with minimal clinical impact. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
