    "abstract_text": "Whereas in many contexts myeloid cells are cytotoxic, it is well-established that as yet unknown microenvironment cues instruct the infiltrating tumor associated myeloid cells (TAMs) to drive malignant progression and dissemination. Recently, we and others have characterized a significant subpopulation of tumor associated myeloid cells that co-express endothelial and myeloid markers designated \u201cvascular leukocytes\u201d. Studies suggest that vascular leukocytes play an important role in tumor progression and also demonstrate modest contribution to functional vessels, i.e. vasculogenesis, suggesting that they represent a critical tumor-promoting TAM subpopulation. We have identified TNF\u03b1 as a key regulator of the vascular transdifferentiation of myeloid progenitors in vitro and within the tumor milieu. TNF\u03b1 at 40ng/ml significantly increased the numbers of flk-1/VE-cadherin dual positive, early outgrowth EPCs from human CD14+ cells by day 7 (about five fold of the control), starting with increased spindle-shaped population appeared as early as day 3. Consistent with this, we observed increased flk-1 expression by \u223c9-fold (p5-fold increase for B16 tumor, p=0.04; >8-fold increase for PyV-mT tumor, p<0.01). Both tumor models indicated that overexpressing TNF\u03b1 caused higher vascular density over control, while tumor necrosis was significantly reduced. Additionally, we observed increased bone marrow-derived vessels (vasculogenesis) in mouse TNF\u03b1-overexpressing tumors, which can be specifically inhibited by an anti-TNF\u03b1 blocking antibody. A significant increase in association of vascular leukoctyes was detected in tumors overexpressing TNF\u03b1 by FACs, which was abrogated in the mice lacking TNF receptors. Interestingly, TNF-overexpressing tumors did not recruit greater overall numbers of tumor-associated (myeloid or lymphoid) leukocytes, suggesting a specific role in myeloid to endothelial transdifferentiation in vivo. Our studies suggest that TNF\u03b1 constitutes part of the microenvironment repertoire that biases recruited myeloid cells towards a proangiogenic/provasculogenic phenotype.",
