    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4427 FLT3 Internal Tandem Duplication is a kinase mutation frequently observed in cases of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study was aimed to investigate the expression of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to analyse the clinical features of patients with mutations and the relation of FLT3-ITD with multidrug resistance gene 1 (mdr1). Samples were analysised from eighty-one new diagnosed pediatric patients with AML. The diagnosis was based on French-American-British (FAB) criteria. Immunophenotyping was done by flow cytometry. For each patient, several clinical and biological characteristics were analyzed (age, WHO performance status, WBC count at diagnosis, bone marrow blasts, FAB subtypes, immunologic phenotype, and cytogenetics). The expressions of FIT3-ITD and mdr1 gene in bone marrow samples was determined by RT-PCR. patients were treated with uniform chemotherapy. Statistical analysis were carried by SAS. The results indicated that the FLT3-ITDs were detected in 8 out of 81 pediatric patients (9.88%) and all mutations detected were hybrid, while less frequently this mutation was detected in adult patients. Although they were irrelevant with sex and immunophenotypes, the mutations seemed predominant in older pediatric patients. The average age is 14-year-old in the patients with mutations, but 9-year-old in those without mutation (P=0.039). The leukocyte counts and bone marrow blast cell counts in pediatric patients with FLT3-ITD at diagnosis were higher than those in pediatric patients without FLT3-ITD (median of 58.4\u00d710\u22279/L versus 19.49 \u00d710\u22279/L, p = 0.001 and median of 78.5% versus 54.4%,p = 0.041 respectively). The normal chromosomes were found in most pediatric patients with FLT3-ITD, although no significane in the stastistics. The patients with FLT3-ITD had lower induction remission rate (only 25%), but the patients without FLT3-ITD had higher remission rate (76.1%). According results detected by RT-PCR, the mdr1 gene was found in 27 pediatric patients, but only 3 out of 8 pediatric patients with FLT3-ITD were detected to express both FLT3-ITD and mdr1. It is concluded that the FLT3-ITD is a frequent mutation in pediatric patients with AML, especially in the elder pediatric patients. It is related with higher leukocyte counts and bone marrow blast cell counts, which may due to the continual activation of Flt3 tyrosine kinase. The prognosis of these patients with mutations is worse and the induction remission rate is lowe. But the FLT3-ITD not relates with the mdr1, which suggests that the low induction rate is not resulted from the multidrug resistance, at least not from the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) activity. So the common MDR modulators may be uneffective for therapy of the patients with FLT3-ITD. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
