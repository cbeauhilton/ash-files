    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2218 The purinergic P2X7 receptor contributes to thrombosis by promoting tissue factor (TF) activation and the release of prothrombotic microparticles (MP). On primed macrophages, P2X7 stimulation induces the procoagulant activity of cell surface TF and the release of MP that carry TF, integrin \u03b21 and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). The generation of TF + MP is dependent on extracellular thiol-disulfide exchange, but intermediates leading to MP generation downstream of P2X7 signaling are incompletely defined. Tracking of cell surface TF by confocal microscopy shows that constitutive internalization of TF is prevented by P2X7 activation. In non-stimulated cells, inhibition of dynamin-dependent endocytosis retains TF on the cell surface, rapidly upregulates TF activity, and releases procoagulant MP carrying TF and integrin \u03b21. Integrin recycling is dependent on the small GTPase ARF6 that is found incorporated into MP released when internalization is blocked. In contrast, activation of P2X7 releases ARF6 into the MP-depleted supernatant rather than associated with MP. Decreased ARF6 GTP loading in P2X7-stimulated cells and additional data in integrin \u03b14 S988A mutant mice with reduced ARF6 activity support the conclusion that P2X7 interrupts constitutive ARF6 recycling to increase cell surface availability of TF-integrin complexes for incorporation into MP. Confocal imaging shows that P2X7 stimulation promotes filopodia formation and the peripheral transport of TF to the tips of filipodia. Proteomics identifies \u03b3-actin as a thiol-regulated MP protein that is released by P2X7 signaling. We show that specific inhibition of thioredoxin reductase attenuates P2X7-induced actin remodeling and filopodia formation, the generation of highly procoagulant MP carrying \u03b3-actin and PDI, and the increased availability of extracellular thioredoxin and free thiols. Importantly, inhibition of thioredoxin reductase also prevented the processing and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1\u03b2. Thus, the thioredoxin reductase system is a crucial intermediate downstream of P2X7 activation that may couple coagulation and inflammation in cardiovascular diseases.
