    "abstract_text": "Mutations of \u03b1 spectrin (Sp) involving the Sp heterodimer self-association site (the \u03b1 I domain of Sp) represent the most common group of membrane skeletal defects in hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) and a closely related disorder, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP). HPP is characterized by extreme anisocytic microcytosis, a severe spectrin dimer self-association defect and spectrin deficiency. The conventional explanation for the different phenotypes is that HPP subjects are compound heterozygotes for an \u03b1 sp defect that interferes with sp tetramer assembly and a second defect which results in decreased synthesis of functional \u03b1 sp. In contrast, HE subjects have normal spectrin content and a less severe sp self-association defect. The clinical expression of HE/HPP is influenced by the inheritance of modifying factors such as the \u03b1 Sp hypomorphic mutation, \u03b1 LELY. \u03b1 LELY is a low expression allele of the \u03b1 Sp gene characterized by a C>G mutation in codon 1857 of exon 40 and a C>T-12 mutation in intron 45 that is responsible for partial skipping of exon 46, which is essential for the functional assembly of \u03b1/b sp dimers. Here we describe a family of northern European descent in which members had different erythrocyte morphology ranging from atypical HPP to HE to normal and a novel \u03b1Sp mutation. Quantitation of RBC membrane proteins of the propositus with atypical non-microcytic HPP revealed 48% spectrin dimers (control 10%) due to a marked increase in the 74kD \u03b1I Sp peptide. There was only a slight decrease in the spectrin/band 3 ratio, which correlated with the normocytic morphology. There was also an abnormal \u03b1 Sp peptide at 41kD suggesting presence of \u03b1 LELY. Sequencing of his \u03b1 Sp gene revealed heterozygosity for a novel mutation in exon 2, codon 34: CGG->CCG (Arg>Pro) and heterozygosity for \u03b1 LELY. These mutations were also present in his brother and daughter who have HE, while another son, who had Arg34Pro, but not \u03b1 LELY has repeatedly confirmed normal morphology (data in pedigree, figure 1). Ongoing clinical, \u03b1 Sp peptide, DNA and quantitative Real Time PCR mRNA studies of extended family reveal a complex interaction of codon 34: G>C mutation with \u03b1 LELY and different levels of transcripts of \u03b1 Sp alleles. #equal contribution.
