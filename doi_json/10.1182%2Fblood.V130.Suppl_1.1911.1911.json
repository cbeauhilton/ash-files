    "abstract_text": "Numerous immune-suppressive mechanisms exist within the tumor microenvironment that may hinder the efficacy of adoptively transferred T cells. One such mechanism is mediated by TGF-\u03b2, a cytokine secreted by tumor cells and infiltrating suppressive immune cells that directly inhibits effector T cell activity. Effector T cells express the TGF-\u03b2 receptors TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, and exposure of T cells to TGF-\u03b2 induces hetero-dimerization of these receptors and phosphorylation of the major TGF-\u03b2 signal mediators SMAD2 and SMAD3. Phosphorylated SMAD proteins (pSMADs) induce a suppressive transcriptional program that ultimately leads to reduced cytokine production, reduced cytotoxicity, and a failure to proliferate in response to antigen stimulation. In several previous reports, a dominant negative receptor (DNR) version of TGFBR2, that does not contain signaling domains, was shown to protect T cells from the impacts of TGF-\u03b2 by blocking the ability of TGF-\u03b2 to induce pSMADs. Herein, we report the development of a novel TGF-\u03b2 signal conversion platform that provides a T cell supportive signal upon exposure to TGF-\u03b2. This platform utilizes co-expression of chimeric variants of TGFBR2 and TGFBR1 where the TGF-\u03b2-binding domain of each receptor is fused to the transmembrane and intracellular signaling domains of a T cell stimulating interleukin receptor. The signaling domains of interleukin receptors that were chosen for this platform are naturally activated via cytokine-induced hetero-dimerization and induce STAT transcription factor signaling pathways beneficial to effector T cell function and persistence. Based on the ability of lentiviral vectors to express large and complex gene expression cassettes, we constructed single vectors encoding both chimeric TGF-\u03b2 receptors (CTBR) in the context of either a CAR or transgenic TCR. This required expression of four unique proteins from a single lentiviral vector when CTBR was combined with a transgenic TCR consisting of unique alpha and beta chains. To demonstrate successful signal conversion, we evaluated the impact of TGF-\u03b2 exposure on multiple functional attributes of CTBR expressing T cells, including gene expression, cytokine production, cytotoxicity, and metabolic function. As anticipated, the STAT signaling signature induced by a particular CTBR was predictive of the functional consequence of exposure to TGF-\u03b2. In the case of a CTBR based on IL-12 signaling domains (CTBR12) that strongly induced STAT4 phosphorylation, CTBR12 expressing T cells secreted significantly greater amounts of IFN\u03b3 than control T cells following activation in the presence of TGF-\u03b2. This result was consistent with IL-12-mediated STAT4 signaling, which induces IFN\u03b3 production in effector T cells. We next evaluated CTBR expressing T cells in a stringent serial re-stimulation assay in the presence of TGF-\u03b2 but absence of exogenous IL-2 cytokine support. Antigen driven T cell expansion was severely limited by exposure to TGF-\u03b2 in this assay, and either CAR or transgenic TCR expressing cells ultimately lost cytotoxic activity over time. T cells overexpressing the dominant negative TGF-\u03b2 receptor failed to expand and clear tumor cells following multiple rounds of antigen-driven stimulation in the presence of TGF-\u03b2, recapitulating the impact of tumor-derived TGF-\u03b2 on infiltrating lymphocyte function. On the other hand, CTBR expressing cells maintained their ability to expand and kill tumor targets in the presence of TGF-\u03b2. Together, these data demonstrate the successful development of a TGF-\u03b2 signal conversion platform that transforms the inhibitory effects of TGF-\u03b2 exposure into a STAT signal that supports T cell effector function. The specific impact on T cell function is dependent on the nature of the signaling domains utilized. This platform is relevant in the context of both CAR T cells and transgenic TCR T cells, and has the potential to produce superior T cell responses in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.
