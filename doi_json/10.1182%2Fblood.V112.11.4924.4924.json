    "abstract_text": "Natural Killer (NK) cells are effector cells in the innate immune system. The anti-leukaemic capacities of NK cells in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation make these cells a potential treatment modality to improve clinical outcome. Immunotherapy with NK cells requires transfusion of large quantities, which obviates the need for an in vitro culture system for NK cells. The killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) on NK cells recognise defined groups of HLA class I alleles. To elucidate the influence of these interactions on proliferation, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 29 patients and donors were cultured in CellGro SCGM with IL-2 and OKT3 antibody to expand the NK cell fraction. The killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and HLA repertoire were determined by sequence specific priming and sequence based typing respectively. The percentage of NK cell expansion from the total PBMC fraction varied between 5.4% and 71.6%. A significantly better NK cell expansion was observed for individuals homozygous for HLA-C epitope group 2 (p<0.05). For evaluation of cytolytic competence of the cultured NK cells, specific killing of an HLA class I expression deficient LCL 721.221 cell line and three 721.221 cell lines transfected with different HLA-C alleles was determined. A significantly better NK cell-induced specific cytotoxicity was observed towards the untransfected 721.221 cells compared to the HLA-C transfected 721.221 cells. No significant differences were observed between killing of the three HLA-C transfected 721.221 cell lines. We have shown that cytolytic capacities of the cultured NK cells are maintained and in vitro expansion of NK cells is dependant on the presence of HLA-C alleles.",
