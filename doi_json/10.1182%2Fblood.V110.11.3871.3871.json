    "abstract_text": "Bacterial superantigens (SAgs) are potent T cell activators. Superantigens stimulate some population of T cells, based on Sag binding to specific T cell receptor variable region \u03b2 chains, a property that distinguishes SAgs from conventional T cell mitogens. The biologic properties of SAgs make them attractive for use in immunotherapy. However, the T cell stimulatory effects of SAgs cannot be confined to specific antigens, its important role might be to enhance the immune effect for tumor antigens. PML-RAR\u03b1 peptide is a specific antigen associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia, which can induce specific proliferation of T cells from healthy human donor in vitro. But the immunogenicity of PML-RAR\u03b1 peptide is weak based on our previous study. In order to investigate the differentiation and proliferation of T cells induced by PML-RAR\u03b1 peptide that combined with Staphyloccucal enterotoxins A(SEA), T cell phenotype, TCR V\u03b2 repertoire usage, clonality and cytotoxicity of T cells were analyzed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were cultured with PML-RAR\u03b1 peptide and SEA for 20 days. After induction, the distribution and clonal expansion of TCR V\u03b2 subfamilies of T cells were examined by RT-PCR and GeneScan. The cytotoxicity of T cells induced against NB4 cell lines were examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). The CD4 and CD8 surface marker on the harvested CD3 + T cells were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). And cytokine levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-10 in the cultured supernatants were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) as well. The results showed that restricted expression of V\u03b2 repertoire (11 V\u03b2 subfamilies) was found, which were V\u03b21, V\u03b22, V\u03b23, V\u03b26, V\u03b27, V\u03b28, V\u03b213, V\u03b214, V\u03b216, V\u03b217, V\u03b219 subfamilies. Clonal expanded T cells could be identified in some V\u03b2 subfamilies, which were preferentially used in V\u03b213 and V\u03b214. The specific cytotoxicity of T cells induced by PML-RAR\u03b1 peptide with SEA was higher than that from PML-RAR\u03b1 peptide alone induction group against NB4 cells. The FCM assay showed that the activation of CD8 + T cells was in priority induced by PML-RAR\u03b1 peptide whether with SEA or not, while it came out to be an equal between CD4 + and CD8 + T cells induced only by SEA. And the IFN-\u03b3 level of Th1-type cytokine was higher than that of the Th2-type cytokines (IL-4 and IL-8) in both cultured supernatants of T cells induced by PML-RAR\u03b1 peptide with or without SEA. In conclusion, PML-RAR\u03b1 peptide can induce specific T cells with clonal expansions of TCR V\u03b2 subfamilies. SEA could enhance the induction of the specific PML-RAR\u03b1 peptide. The T cells induced by combination of PML-RAR\u03b1 peptide and SEA have higher specific antileukemia effect."
