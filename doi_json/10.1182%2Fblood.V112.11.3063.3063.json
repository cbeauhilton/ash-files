    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: A prospective, single arm, open-label, phase II trial was performed to evaluate efficacy of 90 Y-Ibritumomab Tiuxetan at conventional activity of 0,4 mCi/kg in Primary Gastric Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From May 2004 to May 2008, 13 patients affected by Primary Gastric NHL - either Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) or Diffuse Large B Cell (DLBC) NHL, relapsed/refractory disease - were enrolled to receive 90 Y-Ibritumomab Tiuxetan at the activity of 0,4 mCi/kg. Median age was 57 ys (range 36\u201383), 6 female and 7 male. Nine out of 13 patients had gastric MALT NHL, the remaining 4 patients had DLBC NHL. At time of treatment 11 out of 13 patients had stage I/II, 2 patients had stage III/IV disease. Helicobacter Pylori was negative in all patients except one at time of treatment and positive at diagnosis in 5 of them. Median number of previous therapies received was 1 (1\u20134): all patients except 3 had received prior CT, 7 patients prior Rituximab, no one had received prior RT. RESULTS: Toxicities were primarily haematological and reversible. All patients had serial testing for HAMA and none developed antibodies to date. MALT-1 gene rearrangement was detected in 3 of the 9 cases analyzed, while none of the cases showed bcl-10 gene rearrangement. All patients are now evaluable for response: 10 out of 13 patients experienced a complete response (CR) (9 MALT, 1 DLBC); progressive disease (PD) was observed in 2 out of 13 patients, both DLBC NHL; finally another patient affected by DLBC NHL did not respond. After a median follow up of 24 months (range 3\u201350 months) 9 out of 10 CRs are disease free and 5 of them can be considered long term responders at 50, 43, 40, 32 and 31 months, respectively, following radioimmunotherapy (RIT). At the time of the analysis only 1 relapse occurred 17 months after RIT (MALT). Two patients - both DLBC - died due to disease progression. There was no statistically significant associations between response to RIT and the occurrence of the MALT-1 translocation. CONCLUSIONS: 90 Y-Ibritumomab Tiuxetan seems to be very active in patients with primary gastric NHL relapsed or refractory to conventional systemic treatment, especially in gastric MALT NHL. Despite the relative short median follow-up (24 months), we observed durable long-term responses at least in 5 patients. High response rate and durable remissions could be related to the low tumor burden and consequently to higher absorbed doses to tumor, confirming the possible relationship between absorbed doses to tumor, efficacy and duration of response. If preliminary results can be confirmed in larger series, RIT could be offered as valid alternative approach in this setting because of its efficacy and low rate of side effects. These preliminary results warrant further studies.",
