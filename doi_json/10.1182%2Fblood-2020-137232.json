    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Patients (pts) with MDS/MPN-RS-T have limited treatment options for anemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis. Luspatercept, the first-in-class erythroid maturation agent that enhances late-stage erythropoiesis, is approved by the FDA for treatment of anemia in adult pts with lower-risk (LR) MDS with ring sideroblasts (RS) or MDS/MPN-RS-T after erythroid-stimulating agent (ESA) failure. In the randomized, double-blind, phase 3 MEDALIST study, luspatercept significantly reduced transfusion burden vs placebo in pts with LR-MDS (NCT02631070; Fenaux P, et al. N Engl J Med 2020;382:140-51). Here, we assess the efficacy and safety of luspatercept in pts with MDS/MPN-RS-T enrolled in the MEDALIST study. Methods : Eligible pts were \u2265 18 years; had IPSS-R-defined Very low-, Low-, or Intermediate-risk MDS with RS; were refractory, intolerant, or unlikely to respond to ESAs (serum erythropoietin > 200 U/L); and required regular RBC transfusions. Pts were randomized 2:1 to luspatercept (1.0 mg/kg, titration to 1.75 mg/kg) or placebo administered subcutaneously every 3 wks. The primary endpoint was achievement of RBC transfusion independence (RBC-TI) \u2265 8 wks during Wks 1-24. Results : A retrospective analysis identified 23/229 (10.0%) pts enrolled in the MEDALIST trial who had MDS/MPN-RS-T, per WHO 2016 criteria (Arber DA, et al. Blood 2016;127:2391-405); 14 received luspatercept and 9 received placebo. Pts in this subgroup received a median of 4.0 RBC units/8 wks (range 2.0-11.5) during the 16 wks prior to treatment. At baseline, pts had a median hemoglobin (Hb) level of 7.7 g/dL (range 7.0-9.0), a median leukocyte count of 5.1 \u00d7 10 9 /L, a median platelet count of 447.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and 18 (78.3%) pts had serum erythropoietin levels < 200 U/L (Table). In the luspatercept arm, 9/14 (64.3%) pts with MDS/MPN-RS-T achieved the primary endpoint of RBC-TI for \u2265 8 wks during Wks 1-24, compared with 2/9 pts (22.2%) receiving placebo (odds ratio 11.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19, 106.12; P = 0.028). Pts receiving luspatercept were significantly more likely to achieve clinical benefit (achieving RBC-TI \u2265 8 wks and/or modified hematologic improvement-erythroid [mHI-E] per IWG 2006 criteria [\u2265 4 units/8 wks reduction in RBC transfusion in pts with \u2265 4 units/8 wks baseline RBC transfusion burden; Hb increase by \u2265 1.5 g/dL] during Wks 1-24 in pts with < 4 units/8 wks baseline RBC transfusion burden), compared with pts receiving placebo (78.6% vs 33.3%; P = 0.034). Median time from the start of clinical benefit response to end of treatment was 94.6 wks (range 8.0-150.0) in the luspatercept arm and 23.9 wks (range 23.7-57.9) in the placebo arm. During Wks 1-24, mHI-E was achieved by 10 luspatercept pts (6 were high transfusion burden [HTB; defined as baseline transfusion burden \u2265 4 units/8 wks] and 4 were low transfusion burden [LTB; defined as baseline transfusion burden < 4 units/8 wks]) and 1 placebo pt (1/5 HTB). RBC-TI \u2265 8 wks was achieved by 4/8 HTB pts receiving luspatercept (vs 0/5 placebo) and 5/6 LTB pts (vs 2/4 placebo). After 24 wks, pts in the luspatercept arm had a mean Hb increase of +1.7 g/dL compared with an increase of +0.9 g/dL in pts in the placebo arm (least squares [LS] mean difference +0.85 g/dL; 95% CI \u22121.13, +2.82). Greater reductions from baseline in mean serum ferritin levels were seen with luspatercept (\u2212121.8 \u03bcg/L) compared with placebo (\u221291.9 \u03bcg/L) over Wks 9-24 (LS mean difference \u221290.1; 95% CI \u2212758.4, 578.2). Pts in the luspatercept arm had median platelet counts of 467.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L and median leukocyte counts of 6.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L post 24 wks of treatment, compared with pts in the placebo arm with 514.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L and 6.2 \u00d7 10 9 /L, respectively. The incidence of specific TEAEs (occurring in \u2265 1 patient) are as follows: fatigue (1/14 [7.1%] luspatercept vs 1/9 [11.1%] placebo), dizziness (7/14 [50.0%] vs 0/9), dyspnea (3/14 [21.4%] vs 0/9), nausea (6/14 [42.9%] vs 2/9 [22.2%]), arthralgia (1/14 [7.1%] vs 0/9), diarrhea (6/14 [42.9%] vs 1/9 [11.1%]), and hypertension (3/14 [21.4%] vs 0/9). In the luspatercept arm, 1/14 (7.1%) pts experienced \u2265 1 thromboembolic event (transient ischemic attack) and 1/9 (11.1%) pts in the placebo arm progressed to AML (as of July 1, 2019). Conclusions : Luspatercept demonstrated clinical efficacy in pts with MDS/MPN-RS-T with a generally well-tolerated safety profile. These data support the clinical benefits of luspatercept in this patient population with otherwise limited treatment options.
