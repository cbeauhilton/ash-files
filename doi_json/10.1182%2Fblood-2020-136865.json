    "abstract_text": "Direct-to-Patient (DTP) Multiple Myeloma (MM) research studies have been launched recently, including PCROWD (NCT02269592), PROMISE (NCT03689595) and the MMRF CureCloud Research Initiative (NCT03657251), aimed at enrolling thousands of individuals from whom comprehensive molecular and immune analyses will be generated from blood specimens and the resulting data aggregated with the correlating clinical information. To support the molecular characterization of liquid biopsies for such DTP efforts, a set of myeloma-specific liquid biopsy approaches were developed. First, a hybrid selection panel was developed that detects somatic variants present in a patient's circulating-free DNA (cfDNA) in 70 commonly altered MM and Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP) genes. For this MM 70-Gene cfDNA Assay, samples are received as blood in a Streck TM tube designed for stabilization of cfDNA and DNA is extracted from buffy coat using magnetic bead-based chemistry. Deep coverage sequencing (80,000x depth) is performed and duplex BAM files generated with UMI alignment and error correction allowing for sensitive detection of clinically relevant variants. Technical validation data on healthy donor cfDNA mixes was generated using samples with a range of cfDNA inputs. This data determined that the assay is capable of achieving >90% sensitivity for detecting somatic events present at 1% variant allele frequency with a specificity of <0.2 false positives per megabase. Using a clinical cohort, we observed a strong correlation between Bone Marrow Aspirate (BMA) and cfDNA samples with the vast majority of variants previously detected in BMA also identified via the MM-70 Gene panel analysis. Interestingly, we also saw evidence of additional somatic variants identified in cfDNA previously undetected in BMA analysis. Because one the aims of this effort is to return results to treating physicians, a clinical-grade (CLIA) pipeline was established. For that CLIA pipeline, the variants reported are a subset of all the events detected by the MM 70-Gene Assay. The events detected in the assay are reviewed by experienced molecular pathologists at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) who have developed a customized reporting process. These reports utilize an internally-developed knowledgebase of variant/gene annotations that leverages the DFCI expertise in hematologic malignancies and myeloma specifically. The reports are then provided back through providers to the patient via the CureCloud system for their use in clinical care and trial identification. In order to complement the MM-70 Gene panel with copy number and translocation information, we have been exploring Circulating Multiple Myeloma Cells (CMMCs). Our current approach involves automated capture of CMMCs using ferrofluids coated with MM-selective and discriminating antibodies to immunomagnetically enrich circulating plasma cells. The highly enriched CMMCs fractions generated in such a fashion are then submitted for molecular characterization. At the submission date of this abstract, 163 patients have been fully enrolled into CureCloud from which results will be presented. In summary, we have developed a robust and very sensitive clinical-grade next-gen liquid biopsy sequencing platform allowing for minimally invasive monitoring of MM disease genomics that can be used to complement other more classical approaches and to help support our Direct-To-Patient Initiatives. Especially in this post-COVID19 era, such liquid biopsy-based approaches that avoid clinic visits for the patients and can be performed through at-home mobile phlebotomy are emerging as important new options.
