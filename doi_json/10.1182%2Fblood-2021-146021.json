    "abstract_text": "Introduction. Severe hemophilia A (HA) negatively impacts health-related quality of life (HRQOL) through joint pain and disability, treatment burden, and effects on mental and emotional health; chronic pain and mental health are core outcomes for hemophilia gene therapy trials (Iorio, et al. Haemophilia 2018;24[4]:e167-72). In the phase 3 trial GENEr8-1 (NCT03370913), men with severe HA who received valoctocogene roxaparvovec (AAV5-hFVIII-SQ) gene therapy experienced a significant increase in endogenous FVIII activity that resulted in reduced bleeding events and FVIII utilization from baseline through 52 weeks (Ozelo, et al. Res Pract Thromb Haemost 2021;5). Here, we analyzed the impact of valoctocogene roxaparvovec on HRQOL. Methods. Men \u226518 years of age with FVIII \u22641 IU/dL previously receiving standard-of-care FVIII prophylaxis and without history of FVIII inhibitors received one 6x10 13 vg/kg valoctocogene roxaparvovec infusion. This analysis included HIV-negative participants who completed the weeks 49-52 visit. Participants completed QOL questionnaires at baseline and weeks 4, 12, 26, and 52 post-gene therapy infusion. Change from baseline was assessed with a two-sided t-test without multiplicity control. Missing data were not imputed. Measures included the hemophilia-specific Haemo-QOL-A questionnaire, which consists of 6 domain scores (Physical Functioning, Role Functioning, Consequences of Bleeding, Worry, Emotional Impact, Treatment Concern) and Total Score ranging from 0-100 (Rentz, et al. Haemophilia 2008;14[5]:1023-34); and the EQ-5D-5L, a general measure of HRQOL that assesses functional dimensions (Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities) as well as Pain/Discomfort and Anxiety/Depression (Herdman, et al. Qual Life Res 2011;20[10]:1727-36). EQ-5D-5L results are reported as visual analog scale (VAS; range, 0-100) and Utility Index Score (range, 0-1), which is calculated from population norms (Janssen, et al. Qual Life Res 2013;22[7]:171-27). Higher scores indicate better HRQOL. The anchor-based clinically important differences (CID) used for the Haemo-QOL-A were 5.5 for Total Score and 6 for domain scores (Quinn, et al. Abstract, Hemophilia Federation of America Virtual Conference, Aug 2020). For the EQ-5D-5L Index, 0.03 was considered a CID (Kaplan. COPD 2005;2[1]:91-7). However, use of general population norms, together with the presence of a disability paradox in hemophilia, causes the EQ-5D-5L to underestimate the negative impact of hemophilia on HRQOL (O'Hara, et al. Haemophilia 2021;27[2]:245-52), likely leading to underestimation of changes in HRQOL. Results. This analysis included 132 participants. At baseline, mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) Haemo-QOL-A Total Score was 75.7 \u00b1 16.7 (n = 130); at weeks 26 and 52, mean change from baseline in Total Score demonstrated improvement ( P <0.0001) at or above the CID threshold (Table). Improvement in Total Score was noted as early as 4 weeks (change from baseline, 3.0 \u00b1 8.5; P = 0.0001) and by week 12 had reached the CID (5.5 \u00b1 8.4; P <0.0001). Domain scores for Physical Function, Role Functioning, and Consequences of Bleeding also improved from baseline ( P <0.0001), exceeding the CID at weeks 26 and 52 (Table). Treatment Concern demonstrated improvement from baseline ( P <0.001) at weeks 26 and 52, exceeding the CID at week 52. Improvements below the CID were noted for Worry at weeks 26 and 52 ( P <0.01) and Emotional Impact at week 52 ( P <0.05; Table). At baseline, EQ-5D-5L VAS mean \u00b1 SD was 80.1 \u00b1 15.3 (n = 131), which increased by 2.5 \u00b1 13.7 (n = 129) at week 26 and 4.5 \u00b1 13.3 (n = 129) at week 52. Mean \u00b1 SD EQ-5D-5L Index Score at baseline was 0.78 \u00b1 0.17 (n = 131); mean \u00b1 SD changes from baseline at both week 26 (0.04 \u00b1 0.14 [n = 128]) and 52 (0.04 \u00b1 0.16 [n = 129]) demonstrated improvement ( P \u22640.002), exceeding the CID of 0.03. Conclusions. These data demonstrate improvement in core outcomes of mental health (EQ-5D-5L Anxiety/Depression, Haemo-QOL-A Consequences of Bleeding) and pain and discomfort (EQ-5D-5L Pain/Discomfort, Haemo-QOL-A Physical Functioning) as well as ability to perform activities of daily living (EQ-5D-5L Self-Care and Mobility, Haemo-QOL-A Physical Functioning and Role Functioning) for participants with HA following treatment with valoctocogene roxaparvovec compared with their values on standard-of-care FVIII prophylaxis.
