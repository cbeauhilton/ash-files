    "abstract_text": "Background: The use of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy)/tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for GVHD prophylaxis has improved outcomes in haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo-HCT). PTCy is now being evaluated in matched-related (MRD) and matched-unrelated (MUD) allo-HCT. Previous studies demonstrated improved GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS) when PTCy was combined with two immunosuppressive agents and PTCy has also been associated with better relapse-free survival (RFS) as demonstrated in De Jong et al 2019, though only one immunosuppressive agent was used. Currently, there is limited published data comparing outcomes using PTCy/tacrolimus/MMF to standard MRD/MUD GVHD prophylaxis of methotrexate (MTX)/tacrolimus. The importance of studying this comparison may help to improve GVHD outcomes in MRD and MUD allo-HCT. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed adult patients at USC Norris Cancer Hospital (age \u2265 19) who received allo-HCT from 2018 to 2020. The primary end-points assessed were incidence and severity of 1-year aGVHD and cGVHD. Secondary end-points included day+100 mortality, 1-year overall survival (OS), 1-year RFS, 1-year transplant-related mortality (TRM), and 1-year GRFS, defined as grade 3-4 acute GVHD, systemic therapy-requiring chronic GVHD, relapse, or death in the 1-year post-HCT period. Results: A total of 65 adult MRD and MUD allo-HCT recipients and 53 haplo-HCT patients were reviewed. Of the MRD/MUD patients evaluated, approximately 51% (n = 33) were female and 49% (n = 32) were male. The age range was 20-69 years old (median = 46), and the most common diseases included ALL (46%), AML (31%), MDS (11%), and others (i.e. lymphoma, aplastic anemia (AA), myelofibrosis) (12%). 34% (n = 22) of patients received PTCy on D+3 and D+4 with tacrolimus/MMF/ on D+5 as GVHD prophylaxis and 66% (n = 43) of patients received MTX/tacrolimus on D+1, +3, +6, and +11 as GVHD prophylaxis. All haplo-HCT patients received standard PTCy/tacrolimus/MMF. Stem cell source was primarily PBSC except in HLH and AA patients. The PTCy group had more MUD allo-HCT (64%), degree of antigen mismatch (56%), and median age of 50.5 years compared with the MTX group at 44%, 47%, and 44 years respectively. 70% in the MTX group received MAC compared with 45% in the PTCy group. The haplo group had similar demographics to the MTX group. The mean CD34 cell doses in the PTCy, MTX, and haplo groups were 4.87, 5.36, and 7.24x10 6 cells/kg respectively. Incidences of total GVHD, aGVHD, and aGVHD grade 3 or 4 in the PTCy group were 55%, 50%, and 4.5% respectively compared with 65%, 35%, and 7% in the MTX group, though not significant. The haplo group had 68%, 55%, and 1.9% respectively. Incidence of total cGVHD and cGVHD requiring systemic therapy in the PTCy group was 4.5% and 0% respectively compared with 30% (p = .02) and 23% (p =.01). The haplo group had 13% and 1.9% respectively. Day+100 mortality, 1-year OS, 1-year RFS, 1-year TRM, and 1-year GRFS in the PTCy group were 0%, 80%, 60%, 0%, and 64% respectively compared with 7%, 88%, 90%, 7.3%, and 59%. The haplo group had 3.8%, 86%, 89%, 14%, and 66%. In a univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with GVHD were disease status (p = .0.12) and CD34 dose (p = 0.015) and antigen mismatch (p = 0.04) was associated with increased mortality. Discussion: Our results demonstrate improved overall and extensive cGVHD outcomes in the PTCy group and thus an improvement in 1-year GRFS. Furthermore, incidence and severity of 1-year cGVHD in this group are improved when compared with previously reported outcomes. 1-year GRFS reported in De Jong et al 2019 was 45% and 1-year GRFS reported for all groups in our study is higher at 66%, 64%, and 59% for the haplo, PTCy, and MTX groups respectively. Although this was not significant, it may be clinically meaningful given the significant improvement in extensive GVHD and improvement in all other secondary end-points except 1-year OS and RFS. Furthermore, the PTCy group had a higher percentage of mismatched antigens yet demonstrated superior outcomes. 1-year OS and RFS were superior in the MTX group however this is likely due to sample size differences. The improved extensive cGVHD and GRFS outcomes observed using PTCy/tacrolimus/MMF in the MRD/MUD setting should continue to be evaluated and currently there is an ongoing prospective, randomized study to further investigate.
