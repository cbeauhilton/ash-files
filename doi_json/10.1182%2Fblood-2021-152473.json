    "abstract_text": "Anemia of Inflammation (AI) is prevalent in patients with chronic inflammatory states, such as infection, autoimmunity, or cancer. Induced expression of hepcidin by pro-inflammatory cytokines results in iron-restricted anemia. In particular, abnormally elevated levels of the cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) is a hallmark of AI, however its contribution to the pathophysiology of AI is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of TNF\u03b1 in the development of anemia in a TNF\u03b1 knockout (TNF\u03b1KO) mouse model of AI, which is induced with a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of heat-killed Brucella Abortus (BA) (Kim et al. Blood). We hypothesized that TNF\u03b1KO mice would show a less severe form of AI compared to WT animals when challenged with BA. Our results showed that WT-BA mice developed severe anemia within 2 weeks, which was resolved by 8 weeks, whereas the TNF\u03b1KO mice developed leukocytosis and an irreversible macrocytic, hyperchromic anemia. Serum analysis at 8 weeks showed that erythropoietin (EPO) and iron parameters were elevated in TNF\u03b1KO compared to WT mice, which ruled out iron-restriction as the cause for the persistent anemia. However, serum cytokine measurements of TNF\u03b1KO mice at 4 weeks showed continual elevation of interleukin (IL)-12p40 and Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) compared to WT-BA controls. We hypothesized that TNF\u03b1 served an anti-inflammatory role that restrained prolonged inflammation after BA, and in its absence, pro-inflammatory macrophages continuously secreted IL-12p40 levels and induced the proliferation of IFN\u03b3 secreting cells. To test if concurrent loss of IFN\u03b3 would correct the inflammatory phenotype, we crossed TNF\u03b1KO with IFN\u03b3KO mice (DKO). Indeed, IFN\u03b3KO and DKO mice challenged with BA showed complete reversal of the anemic phenotype present in WT-BA and TNF\u03b1KO-BA at 2 weeks. Additionally, serum levels of IL-12p40 were normalized by 4 weeks in IFN\u03b3KO-BA and DKO-BA compared to TNF\u03b1KO-BA mice. Flow cytometry analysis of the bone marrow (BM) and spleen (SPL) at 8 weeks showed T-lymphocytes and macrophages were markedly expanded, whereas erythrocytes and B-lymphocytes were reduced in TNF\u03b1KO-BA mice. However, only modest differences in erythrocytes, macrophage, T- and B-lymphocyte in WT-BA, IFN\u03b3KO-BA and DKO-BA in the BM and SPL were detected. Additionally, we performed immunohistochemistry using an anti-CD3 antibody in SPL and livers of BA treated mice sacrificed at 8 weeks. We found complete disorganization of the white pulp in the SPL and infiltration of T-Lymphocytes in livers of TNF\u03b1KO-BA but not in WT-BA, IFN\u03b3KO-BA or DKO-BA animals. These results led us to question if lack of TNF\u03b1 skewed the BM towards T-Lymphocytes. We investigated the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) LSK, multipotent myeloid progenitors (MPP) LK, and common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) compartments by flow cytometry. Shockingly, the TNF\u03b1KO had over a 30% increase of Lin-cKit+Sca1+ LSKs, compared to TNF\u03b1KO controls, while the Lin-cKit+Sca1- LK population was drastically reduced. By contrast, the Lin-CD217-cKit+Sca1+ CLP population was expanded by more than 40% in the TNF\u03b1KO-BA compared to TNF\u03b1KO controls. Considering this data, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of TNF\u03b1 in AI in vivo from its role in regulating upstream stem and progenitor cell differentiation using a germline KO strategy. However, our observations reinforce the link between iron homeostasis and HSC self-renewal and provide a new model to study inflammation associated bone marrow failure. The TNF\u03b1-BA mice displayed severe anemia, which seems to result from persistent IFN\u03b3 elevation. A recent study identified TNF\u03b1 as a major pro-survival and pro-regeneration factor for HSCs (Yamashita & Passegue, Cell Stem Cell). Other studies have shown that IFN\u03b3 restricts HSCs self-renewal (Chen et al. Blood). Our results in the TNF\u03b1KO-BA treated mice suggest that TNF\u03b1 preserves balanced progenitor output by countering the action of IFN\u03b3 at the HSC level. Ongoing work aims to understand the relationship between TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 in regulating HSC quiescence, self-renewal, and overall pool size.
