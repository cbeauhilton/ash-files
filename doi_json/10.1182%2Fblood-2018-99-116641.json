    "abstract_text": "Background : Elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have a worse prognosis compared to the younger population, since older age is associated with comorbidity and suboptimal performance status leading to intolerance of chemo-immunotherapy. The outcome of DLBCL in the older patients (> 60 years) was well described in clinical trials with reported 5-year overall survival (OS) of 50-80% (Coiffier et al., N Engl J Med 2002). Since this group is often precluded from clinical trials and population-based studies are limited, optimal treatment strategy for the old patients with DLBCL remains controversial. Here, we describe a Chinese real-world experience of management of elderly DLBCL patients treated at National Cancer Hospital, China. Methods : This is a single-center, retrospective analysis of consecutive DLBCL patients aged \u226560 who planned to receive chemotherapy +/- rituximab. The standard regimens included 3-4 cycles (early stage disease) or 6 cycles (advanced) of R-CHOP like regimens (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) followed by two rituximab doses in fit patients; R-miniCHOP for unfit and R-CE(etoposide)OP for frail elder patients. Patient data including baseline characteristics, histology, clinical parameters, and treatment outcomes were extracted from hospital medical records. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoint was OS. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and Kaplan Meier estimates. Results : From June 2006 to December 2012, 349 patients aged \u226560 years were included, in which 204 patients were aged <70 years (Table 1). 326 patients received chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy with rituximab. Median follow up was 82 months. Five year PFS and OS of the elder patients were 45.8% and 51.9%, respectively. Significant difference was seen between patients < 70 years and those \u226570 years in terms of PFS (51.0% vs 38.6%, p=0.030) and OS (58.3% vs 42.8%, p=0.007) ( Figure 1 ). Patients with early-stage disease (Ann Arbor Stage\u2160/\u2161) had better 5-year PFS (60.1% vs 23.5%, p<0.001) and OS (65.3% vs 30.9%, p<0.001) than patients with advanced disease stage (Ann Arbor Stage III/IV) ( Figure 2 ). In addition, regimen including rituximab significantly improved the survival than chemotherapy alone (5-year PFS: 37.3% vs 64.0%, p<0.001; 5-year OS: 44.5% vs 69.3%, p<0.001), especially in patients \u226570 years, which almost doubled 5-year PFS and OS (5-year PFS: 25.4% vs 50.7%, p<0.001; 5-year OS: 28.8% vs 56.0%, p<0.001) ( Figure 3 ). Conclusions : Elder age (\u226570 years) and advanced disease stage (Ann Arbor Stage III/IV) are associated with poor PFS and OS in Chinese elder DLBCL patients. The addition of rituximab significantly improves the survival compared to chemotherapy alone, especially in patients aged \u226570 years. These findings underscore the importance of personalized evaluation and treatment in elder patients with DLBCL.
