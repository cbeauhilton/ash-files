    "abstract_text": "Background: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a rare disease in Mexican mestizos (Br J Haematol 2015;169:909-911 and Int J Hematol 1999;69:253-255). No significant data on epidemiology is available. Methods: epidemiological data from samples referred to Laboratorios Fatima de Michoacan for flow cytometry immunophenotyping for neoplastic hematological disease. Results: 229 samples were received, 52 were diagnosed as CLL (22.7 %). Male 32 and female 20, ratio 1.6 a 1. Age from 33 to 89 years, average 66; 31 to 40 one, 41 to 50 two, 51 to 60 eleven, 61 to 70 twenty four, 71 to 80 ten, more than 81 four. Expression of CD 38 and ZAP-70 in three; only CD38 in 2, only ZAP-70 in three. Conclusions: similar results in male female ratio and age of presentation are noted as compared with international data. Low frequency of expression in CD38 and ZAP-70 may be due pre-analytic phase in the management of the sample. As a regional group we are trying to have epidemiology data in non-malignant and malignant hematological diseases to form specific protocol treatments. Figure 1. View large Download slide Figure 1.
