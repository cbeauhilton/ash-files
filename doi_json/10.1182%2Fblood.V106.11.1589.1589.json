    "abstract_text": "Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell proliferative disorder that is incurable with the currently available therapeutics. New therapies based on better understanding of the disease biology are urgently needed. MM is characterized by accumulation of malignant plasma cells predominantly in the bone marrow. These plasma cells exhibit a relatively low proliferative rate as well as a low rate of apoptosis. Elevated expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members has been reported in MM cell lines as well as in primary patient samples and may be correlated with disease stage as well as resistance to therapy. ABT-737 (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) is a small-molecule inhibitor designed to specifically inhibit anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family and binds with high affinity to Bcl-X L , Bcl-2, and Bcl-w. ABT-737 exhibits toxicity in human tumor cell lines, malignant primary cells, and mouse tumor models. We have examined the in vitro activity of this compound in the context of MM to develop a rationale for future clinical evaluation. Methods: MM cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with L-Glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The KAS-6/1 cell line was also supplemented with 1 ng/ml IL-6. Cytotoxicity of ABT-737 was measured using the MTT viability assay. Apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry upon cell staining with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI). Flow cytometry was also used to measure BAX: Bcl-2 ratios after ABT-737 treatment and cell permeabilization with FIX & PERM (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) Results: ABT-737 exhibited cytotoxicity in several MM cell lines including RPMI 8226, KAS-6/1, OPM-1, OPM-2, and U266 with an LC 50 of 5-10\u03bcM. The drug also had significant activity against MM cell lines resistant to conventional agents such as melphalan (LR5) and dexamethasone (MM1.R) with similar LC 50 (5-10 \u03bcM), as well as against doxorubicin resistant cells (Dox40), albeit at higher doses. Furthermore, ABT-737 retained activity in culture conditions reflective of the permissive tumor microenvironment, namely in the presence of VEGF, IL-6, or in co-culture with marrow-derived stromal cells. ABT-737 was also cytotoxic to freshly isolated primary patient MM cells. Time and dose dependent induction of apoptosis was confirmed using Annexin V/PI staining of the MM cell line RPMI 8226. Flow cytometry analysis of cells treated with ABT-737 demonstrated a time and dose dependent increase in pro-apoptotic BAX protein expression without significant change in the Bcl-X L or Bcl-2 expression. Ongoing studies are examining the parameters and mechanisms of ABT-737 cytotoxicity to MM cells in more detail. Conclusion: ABT-737 has significant activity against MM cell lines and patient derived primary MM cells in vitro . It is able to overcome resistance to conventional anti-myeloma agents suggesting a different mechanism of toxicity that may replace or supplement these therapies. Additionally, it appears to be able to overcome resistance offered by elements of the tumor microenvironment. The results of these studies will form the framework for future clinical evaluation of this agent in the clinical setting.",
