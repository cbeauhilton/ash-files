    "abstract_text": "Dasatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is known to modulate or suppress T-cell activation and proliferation. We report a series of patients of chronic peripheral lymphocytosis development, identified as natural killer (NK) cells or NK/T-cells based on their large granular lymphocyte (LGL) morphologies and CD16 + CD56 + CD3 \u2212 or CD3 + immunophenotypic profiles during dasatinib therapy. All cases that developed LGL lymphocytosis achieved optimal molecular response (8/8 in LGL + patients vs 3/10 in LGL \u2212 patients, p=0.002). A 51 Cr release assay demonstrated that NK cell cytotoxicity has been enhanced in a case of LGL lymphocytosis compared to normal healthy donors ( Figure 1 ), and that NK cell cytotoxicity in dasatinib-responders was superior to that in non-responders ( Figure 2 ). In summary, the present study suggests that NK or NK/T cell lineage LGL lymphocytosis develops associated with dasatinib therapy and that LGL might have a therapeutic effect on Ph + leukemic cells.
