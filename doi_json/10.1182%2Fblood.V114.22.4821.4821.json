    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4821 Objective Previous studies showed inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) increased sensitivity to doxorubicin toxicity in multidrug-resistant cancer cells. This study was purposed to investigate the reversal effect of D, L-threo-1-phenyl-2- -decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, on daunorubicin (DNR) resistance in K562/A02 cells. Material and methods The cytotoxicity and reversal effect were analyzed by MTT method. Flow cytometry was used to test DNR accumulation and apoptosis percentage. The expressions of GCS and mdr1 genes of K562 and K562/A02 cells were measured by RT-PCR and Western blot. Results The inhibition rates of PDMP (\u226420\u03bcmol/l) on the proliferation of K562 and K562/A02 cells were below 10%. The IC 50 of DNR for K562 and K562/A02 cells were 0.23\u00b10.02\u03bcg/ml and 7.15\u00b10.24\u03bcg/ml, respectively. PDMP increased sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to DNR toxicity in a dose-dependent manner (the IC 50 was decreased to 2.76\u00b10.25\u03bcg/ml by 20\u03bcM PDMP and to 4.23\u00b10.08\u03bcg/ml by 10\u03bcM PDMP), but it had no effect on K562 cells. Both 10\u03bcM and 20\u03bcM PDMP increased DNR induced apoptosis compared with DNR alone (the apoptosis percentage were 8.93%\u00b10.83%, 18.33% \u00b1 0.86%and 5.43% \u00b1 0.70% respectively). The mean fluorescence intensity of DNR in K562/A02 cells increased from 1550 treated by DNR alone to 1631 incubating with 10\u03bcM PDMP and higher to 1998 by 20\u03bcM PDMP. The expression of GCS gene was down-regulated by 20\u03bcM PDMP and blocking GCS also showed a dramatic decrease in mdr1 expression. Conclusion PDMP can increase the sensitivity to DNR toxicity in K562/A02 cells by enhancing cell apoptosis rate, intracellular DNR concentration, and down-regulating expressions of both GCS and mdr1 genes.
