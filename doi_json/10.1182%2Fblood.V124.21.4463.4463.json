    "abstract_text": "Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are activated T cells with natural killer (NK) properties that can be expanded in vitro in presence of recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) starting from peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by interferon-\u03b3 and anti-CD3 antibody. They express CD3 and CD56 as well as the NKG2D antigen and show major histocompatibility complex (MHC)\u2013unrestricted cytotoxicity toward neoplastic but not normal targets. CIK cells express several chemokine receptors, and in vivo models suggest that they can migrate to the site of tumors after intravenous administration, there carrying out their cytotoxic potential and helping to control tumor growth. CIK cells have shown cytotoxic activity in vitro and in vivo against hematopoietic neoplastic cells, including AML (acute myeloid leukemia), CML (chronic myelogenous leukemia), and CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Their cytotoxicity against patient with B-NHL (B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma) , however, has not been fully investigated. The elderly population is susceptible to haematological malignancies, and these elderly patients are intolerant to cytotoxic drugs. Therefore, the exploration of a safe and reliable strategy reduse dose of chemotherapy is critical in improving the prognosis of elderly patients with haematological malignancies. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of autologous cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells for consolidation treatmemt in elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from 20 elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. PBMCs were augmented by priming with interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) followed by IL-2 and monoclonal antibody (mAb) against CD3. Autologous CIK cells (range 5 \u00d7 10(9)-1 \u00d7 10(10)) were then infused back to individual patients. The regimen was repeated every 4 weeks. The host cellular immune function, tumour-related biological parameters, imaging characteristics, disease condition, quality of life and survival time were assessed. Fourteen patients received 6 cycles of transfusion and 6 received 4 cycles. After treatment of CIK cells plus IL-2, the general conditions of 20 patients were to different extent improved No adverse effects were observed. The percentages of CD3(+), CD3(+) CD8(+) and CD3(+) CD56(+) cells were significantly increased (p < 0.05), and the levels of serum \u03b22 microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were markedly decreased (p < 0.05) after autologous CIK cell transfusion. Cancer-related symptoms were profoundly alleviated, as demonstrated by the improved quality of life (p < 0.01)., Complete remission(CR) observed in 11 patients before the treatmemt of CIK was still CR; Partial remission(PR) in 9 patients ,After the treatmemt of CIK, the transformation of disease state from partial remission to complete remission was seen in 4 patients. At the end of follow-up, the mean survival time was 24 months. Transfusion with autologous CIK cells is safe and effective for treating haematological malignancies in elderly patients.
