These patients often have younger age of onset, bulky lymphadenopathy, and short clinical response to treatment with purine analogues. Deletion of 11q in CLL is thought to involve loss-of-function of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a protein kinase central to DNA damage responses. As part of a larger study of early-intermediate stage, high risk CLL patients, we applied whole genome copy number variation (CNV) analysis to characterize the genomic alterations in CLL patients with and without del(11q) by FISH. Patients and Methods We studied 17 patients aged 29-67 with early-intermediate stage, untreated CLL who had high risk for disease progression based on evaluation of molecular and immunophenotypic markers. Of these patients, six had del(11q) by FISH analysis. No patients in this study had del(11q) as a sole FISH abnormality. CLL cells and normal cells were separated by magnetic bead selection from patient peripheral blood samples with absolute lymphocyte counts that ranged from 7.4 to 106 \u00d7 10 9 /L. CNV analysis was performed on purified genomic DNA from the CLL cells and from normal cells for each patient in order to distinguish acquired CNVs in malignant cells from polymorphic CNVs in the human genome. We used the Illumina human660w-quad beadchip, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based microarray for whole-genome genotyping and CNV analysis that contains more than 550,000 tag SNPs and approximately 100,000 additional markers that target regions of common CNV. CNV data was analyzed using CNV partition (Illumina Genome Studio software) and PennCNV. Results CNV analysis reveals hemizygous deletions of 11q in all 6 patients positive for del(11q) by FISH. The size of the deletion varies from \u223c980 Kb to \u223c44 Mb. All deletions include the region of the ATM gene at 11q22.3. No large homozygous deletions of 11q were detected. The three largest interstitial deletions (\u223c39 Mb, \u223c41 Mb, \u223c44 Mb) span 11q14.1-q23.3. A slightly smaller deletion of \u223c33 Mb spans 11q14.2-q23.3. One deletion of \u223c8.6 Mb covers 11q22.1-q22.3. The smallest deletion of \u223c980 Kb is found within 11q22.3, centered on the ATM gene. Three out of 6 patients show complex interstitial deletions of 11q that consist of two or more discontinuous segments of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) separated by short undeleted regions. Five out of 6 patients with 11q deletions also show 13q hemizygous deletion by CNV analysis and by FISH. In 4 of these patients, the 11q and 13q interstitial deletions are the only acquired CNV events detected in the CLL genome. In one patient with 11q and 13q interstitial deletions, CNV analysis also shows chromosome 12 copy number (CN)=3 (also detected by FISH), CN=3 at 3q24-telomere (tel), and LOH events consistent with hemizygous deletion at 11p13 and 7p15.2-tel. Most noteworthy are 2 patients negative for any FISH abnormality who show copy-neutral LOH of most of 11q. The region of copy-neutral LOH includes 11q12-tel in one patient and 11q13.1-tel in the other patient. The copy-neutral LOH event involves close to 100% of the CLL cells in one patient, but only about 50% of the CLL cells in the other patient. Conclusions Whole genome CNV analysis by SNP-based microarrays greatly expands our ability to detect acquired genomic events in CLL cells and provides a powerful tool for CLL clinical research. Applying this new genomic technology to CLL patients with 11q deletions reveals marked complexity in the size and structure of hemizygous deletion events, which include the region of the ATM gene at 11q22.3 and can be discontinuous, indicative of complex genomic events. We identified copy-neutral LOH of 11q in 2 patients, a finding not previously described in CLL cells. Copy-neutral LOH of 11q is a genetic mechanism by which biallelic mutations of ATM , in cooperation with the loss of other tumor suppressor genes on 11q, may contribute to poor outcomes in some CLL patients without detectable FISH abnormalities. Additional studies, including sequencing of the ATM gene in 11q copy-neutral LOH patients, are required to confirm this hypothesis.
