    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Daratumumab is a human IgG\u03ba monoclonal antibody targeting CD38 with a direct on-tumor and immunomodulatory mechanism of action. In the global phase 3 ALCYONE trial, the addition of daratumumab to bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (D-VMP) resulted in improved outcomes over bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (VMP) alone in transplant-ineligible patients (pts) with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). At a median follow-up of 16.5 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached (NR) for the D-VMP group versus 18.1 months for the VMP group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.65; P <0.001). With extended follow-up (median follow-up, 40.1 months), D-VMP demonstrated a significant overall survival benefit (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.46-0.80; P =0.0003) and continued to demonstrate significant improvement in PFS versus VMP with no new safety concerns. In the phase 3 OCTANS trial, at a median follow-up of 12.3 months, D-VMP significantly prolonged PFS versus VMP in transplant-ineligible Asian pts with NDMM (median PFS, NR vs 18.2 months; HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24-0.77; P =0.0033). Here, we present a pooled analysis of transplant-ineligible NDMM pts from OCTANS and ALYCONE. Methods: Eligible pts in OCTANS and ALCYONE were \u226518 years of age, had NDMM, and were not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant due to age (\u226565 years) or comorbidities. All pts received up to 9 (42-day) cycles of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m 2 subcutaneously twice weekly on Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5 of Cycle 1 and once weekly on Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5 of Cycles 2-9; melphalan 9 mg/m 2 orally once daily on Days 1-4 of each cycle; and prednisone 60 mg/m 2 orally once daily on Days 1-4 of each cycle. For pts in the D-VMP group, daratumumab 16 mg/kg intravenously was administered once weekly in Cycle 1, once every 3 weeks in Cycles 2-9, and once every 4 weeks thereafter until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cytogenetic risk was determined at baseline via local fluorescence in situ hybridization or karyotype analysis; pts with high cytogenetic risk had a del17p, t(4;14), or t(14;16) abnormality. Results: In total, 220 Asian pts were randomized (D-VMP, n=146; VMP, n=74) in the OCTANS study and 706 global pts were randomized (D-VMP, n=350; VMP, n=356) in the ALCYONE study. The median age was 69 (range, 57-84) years in OCTANS and 71 (range 40-93) years in ALCYONE. Among pts with available cytogenetic results, 48/219 (21.9%) pts in OCTANS and 98/616 (15.9%) pts in ALCYONE had high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. At a median follow-up of 12.3 months in OCTANS and 16.5 months in ALCYONE, in the pooled intent-to-treat (ITT) population from OCTANS and ALCYONE, the estimated 12-month PFS rate was 86.2% in the D-VMP group (n=496) versus 74.6% in the VMP group (n=430), and the estimated 18-month PFS rate was 73.3% versus 50.3%, respectively; the median PFS was NR in the D-VMP group versus 18.1 months in the VMP group (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.38-0.61; P <0.0001) ( Figure A ). In the pooled subgroup of pts with standard cytogenetic risk, the estimated 12-month PFS was 86.7% in the D-VMP group (n=378) versus 74.3% in the VMP group (n=311), and the estimated 18-month PFS rate was 76.4% versus 46.6%, respectively; the median PFS was NR in the D-VMP group versus 17.4 months in the VMP group (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.31-0.54; P <0.0001) ( Figure B ). In the pooled subgroup of pts with high cytogenetic risk, the estimated 12-month PFS rate was 82.9% in the D-VMP group (n=81) versus 69.8% in the VMP group (n=65), and the estimated 18-month PFS rate was 60.6% versus 52.7%, respectively; the median PFS was 19.5 months in the D-VMP group versus 18.1 months in the VMP group (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.32-1.04; P =0.0638) ( Figure B ). Analysis of the pooled ITT population showed PFS and overall response rate (ORR) benefits with D-VMP across clinically relevant subgroups, including pts aged \u226575 years, pts with impaired renal function (creatine clearance \u226460 mL/min), and pts with International Staging System Stage III disease. Conclusion: In a pooled analysis of Asian pts from OCTANS and global pts from ALCYONE, D-VMP demonstrated clinical benefit versus VMP in transplant-ineligible pts with NDMM. The benefit of D-VMP versus VMP was observed across clinically relevant subgroups. These results support the use of D-VMP in transplant-ineligible pts with NDMM.
