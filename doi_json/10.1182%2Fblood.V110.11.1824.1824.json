    "abstract_text": "Background: IFI remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pts with acute myelogenous leukemia or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/HR-MDS). We have previously shown that voriconazole (VORI) or LIPO AB 3 mg/kg/day TIW were effective prophylactic regimens in AML/HR-MDS. LIPO AB given once every week achieves tissue levels expected to prevent IFI, decreases the risk for infusion-related adverse events (IRE) and would simplify prophylaxis. Materials and Methods: We conducted a 3-arm randomized trial comparing LIPO AB, 3 mg/kg/d TIW (LIPO AB 3); versus LIPO AB 9 mg/kg/d, 1/week (LIPO AB 9); versus VORI 200 mg PO 2/day among pts with AML/MDS undergoing induction or salvage chemotherapy (CHEMO). Pts were stratified by age and disease status and randomized to receive any of the 3 regimens 24 hours after completion of CHEMO. Serum Galactomannan Index (GMI) was obtained 2/week while CT scan of chest (CT) was performed for persistent fever after 3 days of broad spectrum antibiotics. Proven and probable IFI were defined according to EORTC/MSG criteria. The results of the first 59 pts (of 150 planned) enrolled between Dec 06 -July 07 are presented. Results: Pts characteristics and response are shown in Table 1. All pts had Zubrod performance status \u2264 2 and most underwent remission induction chemo (90% in each group). No significant differences were observed on key baseline characteristics. Three of the 59 pts did not receive study drug (AMBI 9=2; VORI=1) and were excluded from efficacy and safety analysis. There were no proven IFI; 3 pts developed probable pulmonary Aspergillosis [GMI(+); CT (+), cultures (\u2212) ], while 10 pts received additional empirical antifungal therapy (AFT) because of FUO [ 7 pts; GMI (\u2212), CT (\u2212), cultures (\u2212)] or pneumonia [ 3 pts; GMI (\u2212), cultures (\u2212)]. None of these 10 pts developed proven/probable IFI. Two pts in each study arm developed reversible side effects that lead to drug discontinuation [AMBI 3: Grade 2 hyperbilirubinemia (1); Grade 3 infusion related events (1); AMBI 9: Grade 3 infusion related event (2); VORI: Grade 2 hyperbilirubinemia (1), visual hallucinations (1)]. Overall mortality was 5% (1 pt/arm). There were no IFI-related deaths. Conclusion: Intermittent LIPO AB (3 mg/kg/d TIW or 9 mg/kg/d, 1/week) and VORI 200 mg PO 2/day prophylaxis appear to be effective and well-tolerated regimens. Enrollment of additional pts is ongoing.
