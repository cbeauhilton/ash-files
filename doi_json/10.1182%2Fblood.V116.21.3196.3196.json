    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3196 Immune-mediated thrombosis is a major cause of death in autoimmune diseases and contributes to complications in drug treatments (e.g. Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia). The major receptor on platelets for immunoglobulin-mediated activation is Fc\u03b3RIIA. Fc\u03b3RIIA signals through an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) that leads to phospholipase C activation, which induces the release of calcium and diacylglycerol (DAG). In our previous work, we identified CalDAG-GEFI (calcium and DAG regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor I) as a key component of collagen/ITAM-mediated platelet activation. In the current study, we evaluated if CalDAG-GEFI is a potential target for the intervention with Fc\u03b3RIIA receptor dependent, immune-mediated thrombosis. Mice transgenic for the human Fc\u03b3RIIA (hFCR) and deficient for CalDAG-GEFI-/- (hFCR/CDGFI-/-) were generated. In vitro, aggregation of hFCR/CDGFI-/- platelets required 50\u2013100-fold higher concentrations of anti-CD9 antibodies than hFCR/WT controls. In comparison, inhibition of P2Y12, the target of clopidogrel, shifted the dose response curve for anti-CD9 in hFCR/WT platelets by only \u223c2-fold. In addition to their aggregation defect, hFCR/CDGFI-/- platelets were characterized by markedly impaired Rap1 activation. To assess the role of CalDAG-GEFI in Fc\u03b3RIIA -mediated thrombosis in vivo, we developed a model of antibody-mediated thrombosis, were we injected mice with an Alexa-750 labeled antibody against GPIX and extracted the lungs to visualize pulmonary thrombosis on a LICOR scanner. Anti-GPIX induced pulmonary thrombosis in hFCR mice but not in WT animals. Pretreatment with clopidogrel did not provide a substantial protection from thrombosis in hFCR mice. In contrast, no pulmonary thrombi were observed in hFCR/CDGFI-/- mice. Together, our studies are the first to highlight the importance of CalDAG-GEFI downstream of platelet Fc-receptor/ITAM signaling and suggest CalDAG-GEFI as a powerful new target in the intervention of immune-mediated thrombosis.
