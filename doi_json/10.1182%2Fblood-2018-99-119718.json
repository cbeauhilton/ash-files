    "abstract_text": "B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the most common cancer in children, is a multi-step disease that is initiated in utero ; although B-ALL has an incidence peak at 3-5 years of age, the majority of these children have pre-leukemic cells detectable at birth. Notably, however, up to 5% of newborns have detectable leukemia-initiating genetic abnormalities in their blood, but most of these infants go on to live healthy lives. Identifying the mechanisms that inhibit or drive B-ALL progression has the potential to inform new therapeutic or preventative strategies. Infection has been identified as a potential leukemia progression modifier to explain the discordance between the number of children with pre-leukemia and the number who develop B-ALL. While epidemiological studies have identified the timing of infection as a critical variable, the mechanisms underlying this association remain unknown. The early incidence peak is dominated by the ETV6-RUNX1 translocation-positive and high hyperdiploid subgroups, which together account for ~50% of pediatric B-ALL cases. We have previously reported the ability of immune stimulation with infection-associated toll-like receptor agonists to reduce pre-leukemic cell burden and delay leukemia onset in E\u03bc-RET mice, in which hyperdiploid B-ALL is fully penetrant. Furthermore, exposure of E\u03bc-RET mice to mild infections with Listeria monocytogenes ( Lm ), Murine herpesvirus 68 (MHV) or Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) induces a profound, age-dependent depletion of pre-leukemia cells, with neonatal mice, but not adults, exhibiting reduced leukemia progression after infection. Here, we extend this work by evaluating the influence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Sc ) on leukemia development, hypothesizing that exposures to non-pathogenic commensal organisms would induce a similar protective immune activity. Using our established methodology, E\u03bc-RET mice were exposed to pathogenic or non-pathogenic organisms at six days of age by intraperitoneal injection ( Lm , MCMV, Sc ) or intranasally (MHV), and evaluated for pre-leukemic cell burden eight days later. In contrast to the response to pathogens, exposure of neonates to Sc did not result in a reduction of pre-leukemic cell numbers, even after inoculation with significantly higher numbers of yeast particles. The depletion of pre-leukemia cells induced by infection with pathogenic organisms was dependent on the presence of both \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and NK cells, with the latter population exerting direct cytotoxicity against B-ALL cells. Consistent with a failure to induce pre-leukemia depletion, Sc exposure achieved significantly less activation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and did not activate NK cells at all in neonatal E\u03bc-RET mice. Overall, our results reveal the primacy of the \u03b3\u03b4 T/NK cell response axis for the depletion of pre-leukemic cells after early-life infection and thus identify a novel immune response pathway with the potential to prevent ALL progression in children. Furthermore, these data indicate that not all age-associated exposures are capable of driving an immune response that reduces the risk of leukemia, with the dietary commensal Saccharomyces cerevisiae failing to generate a protective response in neonatal mice. This study significantly enhances our mechanistic understanding of immune-mediated modification of B-ALL progression. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
