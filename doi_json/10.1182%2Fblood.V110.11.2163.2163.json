    "abstract_text": "Immunotherapeutic strategies have gained recognition as viable alternatives to more conventional modalities for the treatment of cancer. In this regard, adoptive T cell therapy through allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation (BMT) has provided the strongest evidence that anti-tumor effects could be achieved against hematological malignancies. However, the major complications of BMT still include graft failure, opportunistic infections, disease relapse and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The presence of mature donor T cells in the transplant inoculum reduces the incidence of the first three complications, while unfortunately increasing the risk of GVHD, which can be directed against either HLA or minor histocompatibilty antigen (miHA) disparities. Thus, a major objective in the field has been to develop tactics that could facilitate the separation of graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effects from the deleterious effects of GVHD. One such approach would be to selectively deplete donor alloreactive T cells in the donor inoculum while allowing residual T cells to provide some protection against infection and to support a tumor-specific GVT response. For a more targeted approach, delayed donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) of positively-selected donor GVT-reactive T cells could be used weeks to months post-transplant, if these elements were identifiable. In this regard, TCR V\u03b2 repertoire analysis by CDR3-size spectratyping can be a powerful tool for the characterization of alloreactive T cell responses. Theoretically, molecular analysis of T cell responses in vitro, given the high sensitivity of the PCR-based spectratyping technique, should identify the most potentially critical V\u03b2 families involved in the later development of GVHD and GVT effects in patients. To this end, we tested the hypothesis that T cell repertoire analysis of HLA-matched sibling (SIB) or matched unrelated donors (URD) from in vitro, host-stimulated, mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) would be predictive of the TCR-V\u03b2 spectratype analysis of the T cell repertoire in the patient following BMT. In this study, we examined 17 patient pairs and report that for the resolvable V\u03b2 families, we observed overall 71.2 \u00b1 11.9% (mean \u00b1 SD.; range 40%\u201385%) of the in vitro anti-host T cell responses were predictive of those in the patient post-transplant. Of the 28.8% non-predictive V\u03b2 families, 6.9 \u00b1 6.3% (range 0%\u201327%) exhibited skewing in the MLC but no skewing in the patient post-transplant repertoire, 9.3 \u00b1 6.3% (range 0%\u201318.8%) exhibited skewing in different peaks within the same V\u03b2 family, and 12.5 \u00b1 10.8% (range 0%\u201340%) showed skewing in the patient post-transplant and none in the MLC. Taken together, these results suggest that the in vitro MLC T cell responses show good consistency with post-transplant patient responses. Thus, in vitro spectratyping may be useful for predicting the alloreactive T cell responses involved in GVHD and could be used to guide custom-designed select V\u03b2 family T cell-depleted transplants to improve patient outcomes. The additional advantage of this approach is that minimization of GVHD risk can be obtained without any direct knowledge of the specific miHA involved in the individual donor-patient pair."
