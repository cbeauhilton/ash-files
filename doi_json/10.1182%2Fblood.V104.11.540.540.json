    "abstract_text": "Tandem autotransplants have recently been reported in the IFM 94 randomized trial to confer more durable event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) than a single transplant. In the Arkansas program, scheduled tandem transplants have been part of Total Therapy 1 (TT 1) and Total Therapy 2 (TT 2) protocols since 1989 for newly diagnosed patients; this strategy was also applied for the management of previously treated patients. Among a total of 1358 patients receiving two prior autologous transplants at our institution (median interval from 1 st to 2 nd transplant, 4 mos), 98 received a further autologous transplant. In a search for features associated with favorable post 3 rd autotransplant survival, pre-transplant 1, 2 and 3 features, especially the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities (CA) and standard laboratory features such as, B2M, CRP, LDH, albumin, hemoglobin and creatinine were examined along with the time interval from 2 nd to 3 rd transplant and whether a 3 rd transplant was applied to rescue TT 1 or TT 2 front line or other patients receiving tandem transplants as salvage therapy. Remarkably, the presence of CA at any of the indicated time points had no impact on survival after a 3 rd autotransplant usually with melphalan 200mg/m 2 . According to multivariate analysis, the 2 nd to 3 rd transplant interval (time-dependent covariate analysis) (HR 8.8, p=.002) and hypoalbuminemia < 3.0g/dL (HR 3.2, p<.0001) were independently important. Thus, post 3rd tx survival was superior among the 41 patients with a post-2 nd tx survival >3 yr and albumin \u2265 3.0g/dL (median, 21 mos; 5 yr OS 20%), with an intermediate outcome noted for the 34 patients with one of these favorable features present (median, 10 mos; 3 yr 20%) while the worst outcome was noted in the 13 patients who were both hypoalbuminemic and had received their 3 rd transplant within 3 yrs of the 2 nd transplant (median, 3 mos, no survival beyond 12 mos). Our data indicate that meaningful survival can be obtained with a 3 rd autotransplant maneuver in approximately 50% of patients who have derived meaningful survival from a 2 nd transplant of at least 3 years and have a preserved albumin concentration as an indication of their overall performance status.
