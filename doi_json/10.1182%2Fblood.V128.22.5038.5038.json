    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Data on APCC\u00b4s effectiveness, safety and quality of life are relatively poor because of the rarity of patients with FVIII or FIX inhibitors, the small populations included in clinical trials and the relatively short follow-up available. The FEIBA-GO study was designed to capture long-term outcomes on effectiveness, safety and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in subjects receiving APCC in different settings in routine clinical practice. Primary objective is to describe the hemostatic effectiveness of APCC in different settings (prophylaxis and on demand, including patients on immune tolerance induction); most relevant secondary objectives aim at describing joint functionality outcomes, safety, HR-QoL, daily activity level, acute and chronic pain associated with hemophilia, as well as healthcare resources used. Methods: The study is a prospective, non-interventional, multicenter cohort study in patients with hemophilia A or B and high-responding inhibitors treated with APCC. A hundred subjects are targeted for enrollment; treatment regimens are at the discretion of the attending physicians in accordance with routine clinical practice, either on early, secondary or tertiary prophylaxis or on demand, including patients treated with APCC during immune tolerance induction. The observation period per subject will be 4 years. Results: As of June 1, 2016, 40 centres have been qualified in 14 countries and 16 centres have been initiated. 27 patients have been enrolled at 14 open sites in 7 countries. Demographic data are available for the 27 patients enrolled so far and are presented for the first time. All patients have severe hemophilia A: 23 are caucasian, 1 african (3 missing). At the enrolment, 18 of them were on prophylaxis and 6 treated on demand (3 missing). Overall median age is 19 years (min-max: 3-71), 17.5 years in patients on prophylaxis (min-max: 3-71) and 39.5 years in patients on demand (min-max: 22-65). Overall median inhibitor titer at enrolment was 8 BU (min-max: 1-2410), 8 BU for prophylaxis (min-max: 1-92) and 12 BU in patients on demand (min-max: 3-35). Nijmegen modified Bethesda assay was used in 18 centres, while 4 used non-modified Nijmegen Bethesda assay (5 missing). Six subjects (3 on prophylaxis, 2 on demand and 1 unknown) have been reported to have overall 13 target joints. Assessment for acute pain was performed in 12 patients and for chronic pain in 9 patients. Two of 12 patients assessed reported acute pain (both on demand). Two of the 9 patients in whom the assessment was performed reported chronic pain (treatment regimen missing). For one patient, information is not available and for another one it has been reported that pain assessment is not routine examination. Gilbert Score was assessed in 6 patients at screening. Discussion/Conclusion: This study will further enhance the information on long-term effectiveness, HR-QoL and safety of APCC across and beyond Europe in the real world on hemophilia A and B patients with high-responding inhibitors under a variety of prescribing regimens in routine clinical practice.
