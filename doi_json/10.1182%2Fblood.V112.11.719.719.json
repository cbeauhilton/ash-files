    "abstract_text": "Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) occurs in approximately 20\u201350% of matched-related stem cell transplants (HCT). The presence of increased frequencies of CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells (T reg ) in murine donor grafts has been shown to ameliorate aGVHD. In similar models, several groups have demonstrated that the transfer of equivalent numbers of nai\u0308ve T cells (vs. various memory subsets) confers a relatively greater risk for aGVHD. To test the hypothesis that natural variations in donor graft nai\u0308ve and T reg content would be associated with the incidence of aGVHD in graft recipients, we conducted a detailed analysis of donor graft T cells within unmanipulated grafts of 70 SCT recipients transplanted for AML/MDS following the administration of a uniform fludarabine/busulfan conditioning regimen. Median follow up time was 38 months. 19% (n=13) of recipients experienced grades II\u2013IV aGVHD (n=3 grades III\u2013IV). Cryopreserved donor grafts samples were analyzed using 9-color flow cytometry (with a panel including a viability dye and MAbs recognizing CD4, CD8, CD25, CD127, CD45RA, CD27, Foxp3, and Ki-67). Tregs were defined as being CD4 + CD25 + CD127 lo Foxp3 + . CD45RA and CD27 were used to measure nai\u0308ve (CD45RA + CD27 + ) and memory conventional CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. In addition, the proliferating fraction of all cells was defined by Ki-67 nuclear-antigen expression. We conducted analyses based on donor graft T cells assessed both continuously and by quartiles, with similar results. No significant associations were found between aGVHD incidence and total T regs (HR 1.01, 95%CI 0.9\u20131.2, p 0.8), nor with proliferating T regs (HR 1.2, 95%CI 0.2\u20135.9, p 0.8). Since murine models typically fix the dose of T regs vs. conventional T cells (Tcon), we also analyzed GVHD risk by donor graft T reg :Tcon ratio, finding no association (HR 1.03, 95%CI 0.8\u20132.1, p 0.3). Although patients in the highest T reg :Tcon quartile received Treg doses known in vitro to induce suppression (>1:21.5), there was no reduction in aGVHD (HR 1.5 Quartile 4 vs others, 95%CI 0.5\u20134.9, p 0.5). Additionally, no significant association with aGVHD was found with total nai\u0308ve T cells (HR 1, 95%CI 0.9\u20131.0, p 0.9), nai\u0308ve CD4 + (HR 1, 95%CI 0.9\u20131.03, p 0.6), or nai\u0308ve CD8 + cells (HR 0.98, 95%CI 0.9\u20131.03, p 0.6). Because nai\u0308ve:memory cell ratios were also fixed in murine models demonstrating the importance of nai\u0308ve T cells in GVHD, we also assessed nai\u0308ve:memory T cell ratios within donor grafts with respect to recipient aGVHD. No reduction in aGVHD was observed considering nai\u0308ve:memory ratios analyzed continuously (HR 1.1, 95%CI 0.3\u20134.2, p 0.8) or in the quartile receiving the lowest nai\u0308ve:memory ratio (HR 0.5 Quartile 1 vs others, 95%CI 0.1\u20132.2, p 0.3). Our results demonstrate that donor graft T reg and nai\u0308ve T cell content, assessed in the context of unmanipulated PBSC transplantation in matched siblings, does not predict recipient aGVHD incidence. These data suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of T reg enrichment and/ or nai\u0308ve T cell depletion may require grafts to be manipulated to supraphysiologic levels for maximal therapeutic benefit."
