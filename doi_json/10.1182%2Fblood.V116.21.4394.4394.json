    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4394 Most low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have a mean molecular weight in the range of 4\u20136 kDa and anti-Xa/IIa ratios of 3\u20136. Further depolymerization of porcine mucosal heparin results in the generation of Ultra low molecular weight heparins (ULMWHs) with a molecular weight range of 2\u20134 kDa with proportionately decreased anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities. Bemiparin (Rovi, Madrid, Spain) represents one such ULMWH. AVE 5026 (Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France) is a unique ULMWH (2.5 kDa) which exhibits higher affinity to antithrombin (AT) and therefore, enhanced anti-Xa activity. Because of the compositional differences between these two agents, it was hypothesized that each of these agents will have distinct anticoagulant, antiprotease and thrombin generation effects. Each of these agents was supplemented to native whole blood. Anticoagulant activity was measured using ACT, TEG, PT, APTT, thrombin time and Heptest assays. Similar studies were carried out in plasma. Amidolytic assays were used to determine the anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities. Both agents were also tested for the interactions with heparin cofactor II (HC II) and AT and were compared in the HIT antibody screening assay using platelet aggregation. In whole blood clotting assays bemiparin showed a strong anticoagulant activity in comparison to AVE 5026. Both agents also exhibited assay dependent differences in the APTT, heptest and thrombin time assays. AVE 5026 exhibited a higher anticoagulant activity in the heptest whereas bemiparin showed a stronger anticoagulant effect in the other clot based assays. In the amidolytic anti-Xa assay, AVE 5026 showed an activity of 156U/mg compared to 86 U/mg for bemiparin. In the anti-IIa assay bemiparin showed a higher activity (10 U/mg) in comparison to AVE 5026 (3.2 U/mg). The calculated Xa/IIa ratio of AVE 5026 was > 48, whereas it was 8.6 for bemiparin. While bemiparin exhibited interactions with HC II, AVE 5026 did not show significant activity in the tested concentrations (anti-IIa \u2013 IC50: 1.10\u00b1.45 \u03bc M and >3.44\u00b1.00 \u03bc M, respectively). On the other hand, AVE 5026 exhibited stronger interactions with AT in comparison to bemiparin (anti-FXA \u2013 IC50: .223\u00b1.03 \u03bc M and .894\u00b1.06 \u03bc M, respectively). Interestingly, heparinase digestion of the two products resulted in a complete loss of anti-IIa activity, but residual anti-Xa activity was found. AVE 5026 exhibited stronger anti-Xa interactions even after heparinase digestion. In the heparin induced platelet aggregation assay at 2.5 \u03bc g/ml, bemiparin showed a relatively higher prevalence of positive interactions with HIT antibodies, whereas AVE 5026 showed a much lower prevalence (slope; AVE 5026 compared bemiparin, p=0.012). Bemiparin exhibited greater platelet factor 4 neutralization in comparison to AVE 5026. These studies clearly demonstrate that while bemiparin behaves like a typical ULMWH, AVE 5026 behaves differently in the different assays. Moreover, the oligosaccharide composition of the two products, in terms of distribution profile structure, is also different. Therefore, AVE 5026 does not represent a typical depolymerized ULMWH and is expected to exhibit a distinct pharmacologic and clinical profile.
