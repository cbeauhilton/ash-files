    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Cytomegalovirus disease (CMV-D) is a major complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). CMV monitoring and preemptive therapy has been effective in decreasing CMV disease rates but this disease remains a challenge for many patients, especially with the increasing trend of using alternative donors, T-cell depletion (TCD) and more immunosuppressive regimen. In this study, we attempted to evaluate clinical characteristics; risk factors for progression from CMV viremia (CMV-V) to disease and the impact on transplant outcomes. Methods : A total of 548 patients were evaluated after receiving HSCT between 2005 and 2012 at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre for occurrence of CMV infection (viremia or disease). CMV-V was diagnosed in peripheral blood samples obtained on two occasions either by PCR (\u00b3 200 IU/ml) or antigenemia testing (\u00b32 positive cells/100000). CMV disease (CMV-D) was defined by pathological evidence of virus in the involved organ. A total of 246 were included in the analysis. Patients were stratified into two groups, CMV-V only group versus CMV-D with or without preceding viremia. The CMV-D group median age was 50 years (range 17-71) and 17 (34%) were female. Matched related donors were used for twenty-two patients (54%). Twenty-four patients (59%) were transplanted for a myeloid and 15 (37%) for a lymphoid malignancy. Twenty patients (49%) were CMV sero-positive recipient and negative donor (R+D-) while 20 (49%) were recipient and donor CMV sero-positive (R+D+) and 1 (2%) was CMV sero-negative recipient and sero-positive donor (R-D+). Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis included CSA/MMF (n=19, 46%) and CSA/MTX (n=22, 54%). Conditioning regimen with myeloablative preparative regimens were administered to 29 patients (71%), 12 patients (29%) were treated with reduced intensity regimen (RIC). Thirty-seven patients (90%) received peripheral blood stem cells as a stem cell source. In vivo TCD with alemtuzumab was used in 15 (37%). Results: With a median follow-up of 40 months among survivors (range 12-88), CMV-D occurred in 17% (n=41). The median time of onset of CMV-D was 11 months (range 1-88). CMV-D was preceded by viremia in 89% (n=36) versus 11% (n=5) without previous viremia. >3 CMV-V events occurred prior to disease in 39% (n=14) versus 1-2 events in 61%(n=22) of patients. CMV-D affected the lung in 76% (n=31), colon in 15% (n=6), retina in 2% (n=1), liver in 2% (n=1) and 5% of the patients had multi-organ involvements (n=2). Multiple CMV-D (> 2) occurred in 17% (n=7) of the patients. The involved organs differ only in 25% (n=2) of the patients. The transplant outcomes showed higher incidence of acute and chronic GVHD in CMV-D group (Table 1) and NRM (p=0.03; Fig 1B) in CMV-D group but no confirmed differences in OS or relapse. Table 1.

View large Download slide Transplant outcomes according to the occurrence of CMV infection following allogeneic HSCT A multivariate analysis for the risk of progression from viremia to disease demonstrated chronic GVHD (p< 0.03, HR 2.09) together with the use of total body irradiation (TBI) of 1200 cGY (P=0.01, HR 2.77) as an independent risk factors. Neither CMV sero-status nor the numbers of previous CMV-V events were confirmed as independent factors. For survival analyses, CMV-D was not confirmed as independent risk factor for NRM, OS or relapse. A correlation between the time of diagnosis with CMV-D and NRM using the ROC analysis showed day 120 as significant cutoff with AUC=0.722 (sensitivity=0.522, specificity=0.800). The NRM & OS in early CMV-D (i.e. within 120 days from HSCT) was 80% and 7% versus 42% (P=0.004) and 54% (P=0,003) in late CMV-D group (>120 days; Fig 1A), respectively. There were no differences in relapse rate between both groups. The cumulative incidence of grades 1-4 acute GVHD, grades 2-4, grades 3-4 at day 120 and overall chronic GVHD at 2 years in early CMV-D was 93%, 87%, 73% and 27% versus 85%, 58%, 7% and 92% in late CMV-D group, suggesting very higher incidence of severe acute GVHD in early CMV-D versus higher incidence of chronic GVHD in late CMV-D. Conclusion: 1) Chronic GVHD and TBI 1200cGY are independent risk factors for progression from CMV-V to disease. 2) CMV-D may occur without proceeding viremia 3) Early CMV-D within the first 120 days from allogeneic HSCT is associated with very higher mortality rate which probably affected in part by the occurrence of severe acute GVHD.
