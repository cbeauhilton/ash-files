    "abstract_text": "CD40 is a TNF receptor found on the cell surface of mature B cells (B lymphocytes) and most B-cell malignancies including multiple myeloma (MM). SGN-40 is a high-affinity, humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the CD40 antigen. Recently, it has been shown that SGN-40 decreases the proliferation of malignant B cells by partial agonistic signaling and effector functions in vitro . In this study, we examined the anti-MM effects of SGN-40 in vivo using a CD40 + SCID-hu murine model of human myeloma, LAG\u03ba-1A. Each immunodeficient (SCID) mouse was implanted with a 2.0 \u2013 4.0 mm 3 LAG\u03ba-1A tumor fragment into the left hind limb muscle. The tumor was allowed to grow for 14 days at which time human IgG levels were detectable in the mouse serum. Mice were then randomly assigned to one of four SGN-40 treatment groups (6 mice per treatment group). SGN-40 was administered via intraperitoneal injection twice per week at doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg. Control mice were given a control IgG antibody (3 mg/kg) using the same schedule. Mice receiving the higher doses of SGN-40 showed marked inhibition of tumor growth (0.3 mg/kg, P < 0.02; 1 mg/kg, P < 0.03; and 3 mg/kg, P < 0.04) and reduction of paraprotein levels (1 mg/kg, P < 0.05; and 3 mg/kg, P < 0.03) compared to mice receiving control antibody. At the lowest dose of SGN-40 evaluated (0.1 mg/kg) a slight inhibition of tumor growth was observable, but there was no effect on human paraprotein. Treatment with SGN-40 was not associated with any observed toxicity. Based on these data with SGN-40 monotherapy, we are currently investigating the antitumor activity of SGN-40 plus bortezomib as well as other available anti-MM agents using our in vivo SCID-hu myeloma murine model. These data for single-agent SGN-40 are encouraging and support testing SGN-40 both alone and in combination regimens to treat MM patients.",
