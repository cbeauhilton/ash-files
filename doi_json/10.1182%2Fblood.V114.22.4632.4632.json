    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4632 BACKGROUND The HGAL gene has prognostic value in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and expression of its cognate protein is germinal center\u2013specific. A previous study had suggested that HGAL protein expression might also be related to outcome in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS The aim of the current study was to confirm the prognostic impact of HGAL protein expression in an independent, well-characterized cohort of 232 classic Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated uniformly with the ABVD regimen from 1997 to 2004 in Brazil. The median follow-up was 6.2 years. RESULTS Tissue microarray analysis showed HGAL staining in 188 specimens (81%). The overall survival was better in patients with young age, early-stage, absence of B symptoms, low-risk international prognostic score (IPS) and good performance status. Failure-free survival was superior in patients with early-stage disease, low-risk IPS and HGAL-positive patients. The estimated 5-year failure-free survival for HGAL-positive and HGAL-negative patients was 82% and 67%, respectively (P=0.03). When stage, B symptoms and performance status were included along with HGAL in a multivariate analysis, advanced stage and absence of HGAL staining were independent predictors of a worse failure-free survival. CONCLUSION This study confirms and validates recent findings of a correlation between HGAL expression and outcome in classical Hodgkin lymphoma.
