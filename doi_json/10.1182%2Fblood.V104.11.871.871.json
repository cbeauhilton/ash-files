    "abstract_text": "Management of patients with refractory and relapsed AML needs optimization. We performed a prospective study in these patients aiming at 1) the definition of the anti-leukemic efficacy of the S-HAI regimen; and 2) the evaluation of the prognostic impact of cytogenetic aberrations at relapse in the context of other prognostic parameters. Treatment consisted of AraC 1 g/sqm q 12 h days 1, 2, 8, and 9 and idarubicin 10 mg/sqm days 3, 4, 10, and 11. AraC was given at 3 g/sqm in patients under age 60 with refractory AML or relapse after CR1 6 months 13%/25%/62%; cytogenetics at relapse favorable/intermediate/unfavorable/not available 7%/44%/24%/25%; secondary AML 7%. Median duration of neutropenia 618 months 56%; p60 years (40% vs. 39%). EFS and OS were significantly related to duration of CR1 (p=0.0001 and p=0.0004) and CG at relapse (p=0.0002 and p=0.0009). Logistic regression analysis revealed CG at relapse (p=0.006) as well as duration of CR1 (p=0.004) being independently related to CR rate. Cox regression analysis revealed CG at relapse (p=0.001) and duration of CR1 (p=0.014) being independently related to EFS. CG at relapse was the only parameter independently related to OS (p=0.001). The inclusion of the therapy-dependent parameter, residual bone marrow blasts at day 18 (day 18 blasts), revealed day 18 blasts being independently related to CR rate, EFS, and OS. These data indicate that 1) the S-HAI regimen confers a significant anti-leukemic efficacy in patients with relapsed and refractory AML unless unfavorable CG are present; and 2) CG at relapse is the most important prognostic parameter in these patients and day 18 blasts may be used to early identify treatment failure and guide the decision about alternative treatment approaches."
