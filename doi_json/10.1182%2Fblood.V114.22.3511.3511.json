    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3511 Poster Board III-448 CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical in maintaining self-tolerance and preventing organ-specific autoimmune diseases. However, the role of Tregs in the pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), an immune disorder in which increased platelet clearance is caused by antiplatelet autoantibodies, has not yet been clarified. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the interaction between dendritic cells (DCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) may play a pathogenetic role in ITP. Forty patients with active disease and 35 healthy subjects were enrolled into the study. We firstly characterized the number (by flow cytometry) and the suppressive activity (by modified allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction) of Tregs in ITP. We found that the absolute number of Tregs was significantly decreased in ITP patients in comparison to healthy subjects (CD4+CD25highFoxp3+ T cells (5.5\u00b14.3 vs 11.6\u00b16.9 cells/microL; p below 0.01) and CD4+CD25highCD127low-negative T cells (50.9\u00b127.3 vs 80.5\u00b137.7 cells/microL; p below 0.02)). We documented also that in ITP suppressive activity of Tregs was defective as compared to healthy subjects. In parallel experiments we studied the in vitro conversion of CD4+CD25- T cells, either from ITP patients or healthy subjects, into CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs by co-coltures with mature autologous/allogeneic DCs. The flow cytometry analysis showed that in ITP the low number of circulating Tregs may be partly due to the reduced ability of DCs to convert non-Treg cells into Tregs. We then explored the in vitro capability of CD4+CD25+ Tregs, either from ITP patients or healthy subjects, to inhibit allogeneic DCs maturation by flow cytometry evaluation of the expression of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. We demonstrated that in ITP patients CD4+CD25+ Tregs show lower ability to inhibit DCs maturation because they do not affect the expression of CD80 and CD86 molecules. This finding may be related to the lower level of Interleukin-10 and Interleukin-6 in the cocoltures. Taken together, these findings document that the interaction between DCs and Tregs is altered in ITP and suggest that this dysfunction may play a pathogenetic role.
