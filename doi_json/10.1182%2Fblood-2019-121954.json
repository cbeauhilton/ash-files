    "abstract_text": "Background: NMS-03592088 is a novel, potent inhibitor of the FLT3, CSF1R and KIT receptor tyrosine kinases (KD < 1 nM for all three targets). The compound demonstrated high preclinical efficacy following oral administration in all tested target-dependent tumor models, including those harboring kinase domain secondary resistance mutations, such us the FLT3 residue 691 gatekeeper mutation and the KIT residue 670 and exon 17 mutations. In a FLT3-ITD model of disseminated AML, efficacy observed following single agent treatment with NMS-03592088 was further significantly increased when administered in combination with cytarabine, with excellent tolerability. In preclinical studies conducted in non-human primates, a dose-related increase of circulating CSF1 levels was observed in association with the administration of NMS-03592088, consistent with in vivo inhibition of CSF1R by the compound, thus providing the opportunity for the use of CSF1 levels as a potential pharmacodynamic biomarker of CSF1R modulation in the clinical setting. All three targets of NMS-03592088 are relevant in different settings of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. In particular, FLT3 mutations occur in approximately 30% of acute myeloid leukemia patients (AML), and are associated with a poor prognosis; KIT mutations are reported in patients with the core-binding factor (CBF) subtype of AML and the CSF1 and/or CSF1R genes are frequently expressed in AML blasts. Recent experimental evidence suggests a potential therapeutic rationale for CSF1R blockade in AML, possibly due to interference with microenvironmental support [Edwards DK et al, Blood, 2019, 133: 588]. Furthermore, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) blasts express high levels of CSF1R and NMS-03592088 was able to effectively inhibit their proliferation, concomitant with the suppression of intracellular CSF1R dependent signalling. A clinical trial exploring safety, tolerability and efficacy of NMS-03592088 in patients with AML and CMML is therefore warranted. Trial design: This first-in-human study (EudraCT Number: 2018-002793-47) is designed as an open-label multicenter Phase I/II trial including patients with relapsed or refractory AML or CMML who have exhausted standard treatment options, or for whom standard therapy is considered unsuitable. The study is designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and to explore the preliminary anticancer activity of NMS-03592088 administered orally as single agent once daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by a 7-day break within a 28 day cycle. The study includes an initial conventional phase I part with an accelerated dose titration design in subsequent cohorts of 3+3 patients aimed at defining the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), followed by a limited dose expansion to confirm the RP2D. Once the RP2D is confirmed, a single-stage exploratory Phase II part will start comprising two parallel cohorts, one cohort will consist of AML FLT3 mutated patients and one of patients with CMML. Patients previously treated with FLT3 inhibitors are allowed to participate. The primary endpoint of the Phase II portion of the study is Overall Response Rate. Efficacy will be assessed according to standard criteria [D\u00f6hner H et al, Blood 2017, 129: 424; Savona MR et al., Blood, 2015, 125: 1857]. Exploratory endpoints are included to evaluate the potential effects of treatment with NMS-03592088 on circulating levels of CSF1 in plasma, the potential correlation of cellular CSF1R expression levels with clinical outcome in both AML and CMML, and the mutational status of a panel of leukemia-related genes, not limited to FLT3. The Phase I part started in Italy in March, 2019 and is currently ongoing. Disclosures Ciomei: NMS: Employment. Zanetta: Clioss: Employment. Fiorentini: Accelera: Employment.
