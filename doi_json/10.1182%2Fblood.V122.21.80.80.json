    "abstract_text": "CDK4 and CDK6, which drive cell cycle entry and progression through G1 in the presence of cyclin D, are overexpressed at a high frequency in human cancers. Targeting CDK4 with the first selective and potent CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor, palbociclib (PD 0332991), has recently achieved unprecedented clinical efficacy in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Most notably, palbociclib more than tripled the progression free survival of breast cancer patients treated with letrozole. In mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), CDK4 overexpression and aberrant cyclin D1 expression leads to unrestrained cycling and proliferation that underlies disease progression. In the first phase I single-agent palbociclib clinical trial in recurrent MCL, inhibition of CDK4 by palbociclib alone resulted in a durable clinical response with tumor regression in some MCL patients, including one complete response and two partial response. However, the fundamental mechanism for differential clinical response to selective targeting of CDK4/CDK6 remains obscure. To address this question, we have developed a novel strategy that both inhibits proliferation of cancer cells and reprograms them for cytotoxic killing by reversible inhibition of CDK4/CDK6. We have shown that: 1) inhibition of CDK4/6 with palbociclib leads to early G1 arrest that is dependent on Rb, the substrate for CDK4/CDK6; 2) prolonged early G1 arrest ( pG1 ) reprograms cancer cells for killing by diverse agents; 3) pG1 sensitization is exacerbated in synchronous S phase entry ( pG1-S) upon palbociclib withdrawal. Further, pG1 sensitization appears to stem from restricted expression of genes scheduled for early G1 only, which is exacerbated in pG1-S due to incomplete restoration of cell cycle-coupled gene expression. To advance targeting CDK4 in MCL, we have implemented this strategy combining palbociclib with bortezomib at a reduced dose (1.0 mg /m2) in a phase I clinical trial (Pa-Btz) in recurrent MCL. palbociclib was administered to MCL patients on days 1-12 of a 21-day cycle to induce pG1; bortezomib was given on days 8 and 11 in pG1 and on days 15 and 18 in pG1-S. Pa-Btz was well tolerated and appeared to have a palbociclib dose-dependent durable clinical activity, with only one of 6 patients progressed at the optimal dose combination. We investigated the genes that mediate pG1 reprogramming by integrative whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS). The dynamic changes in cell cycle-coupled gene expression were determined within individual patients in primary MCL tumor cells isolated from serial lymph node biopsies at baseline, in pG1 (day 8) and in pG1-S (day 21) in conjunction with immunohistochemistry (IHC). palbociclib inhibited CDK4 and induced pG1 in all patients initially, regardless of the clinical response, mutations in p53 or ATM, cyclin D1 3\u2019UTR deletion, or other patient-specific deletions, amplifications and mutations. No mutations were detected in CDK4, which was expressed in primary MCL cells over CDK6. Induction of pG1 maintained the expression of cell cycle genes programmed for early G1 (CDK4, cyclin D and Rb), and prevented the expression of those scheduled for late G1 (cyclin A), S phase (Ki 67, TK) and G2/M (CDK1, cyclin B), and this was completely reversible upon release of the early G1 block. However, induction of pG1 also led to an imbalance in the expression of other cellular genes due to restricted expression of only genes programmed for early G1. Among the 868 genes that were suppressed in pG1 (not programmed for early G1) in MCL tumor of clinically-responding patients (N=4, EdgeR, FDR 0.05), 9 were conversely activated in the non-responding patients (N=4, EdgeR, FDR 0.05). These genes are involved in redox stress, metabolism and cell migration, suggesting a potential role of cell cycle-coupled metabolic imbalance in differential clinical response to targeting CDK4/6. Thus, selective inhibition of CDK4 led to Rb-dependent pG1 in tumor cells of all MCL patients despite a multitude of genomic aberrations. Integrative WES and WTS analysis of serial tumor biopsies revealed that pG1 reprograms MCL cells by inducing an imbalance in gene expression that is associated with the clinical response to the Pa-Btz therapy. Defining the functions of the candidate genes identified in the context of clinical response should shed light on the mechanism for therapeutic targeting of CDK4/CDK6 and advance genome-based patient stratification.
