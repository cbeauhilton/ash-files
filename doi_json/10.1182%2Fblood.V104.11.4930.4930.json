    "abstract_text": "Recently, a consensus panel of experts recommended alkylator therapy, nucleoside analogues and rituximab as appropriate first line therapies for WM ( Semin Oncol  2003 ; 30 : 121 ). It was also recommended that candidates for future autologous transplantation should have limited alkylator or nucleoside analogue exposure due to potential stem cell harm. CHOP-R (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone, rituximab) is a highly active, stem cell sparing regimen that has been extensively evaluated in other low-grade Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma patients. No published experience in WM exists. As such, we analyzed the outcome of 13 patients with WM who received CHOP-R at our Institution. Patients had a median age of 54 (range 44\u201372) yrs, and a median of 1 (range 0\u20135) prior therapies. 8 of 13 (62%) patients had relapsed (n=2) or were refractory (n=6) to fludarabine. Five patients had received rituximab previously. Patients received a median of 6 cycles (range 2\u20136) of standard dose CHOP, and 6 infusions (range 2\u20136) of Rituximab (375 mg/m 2 ). Three patients received additional rituximab (4 weekly infusions every 6 months) as maintenance therapy. Median IgM for all patients declined from 4,975 (range 1,960\u201312,400) to 1,575 (range 62\u20138,230) mg/dL (p=7 x 10 \u22125 ); median S.V. 2.8 (range 1.5\u201312) declined to 1.6 (range 1.3\u20134.8) CP (p=0.04). Importantly, the median hematocrit rose from 30.7 (range 21.9\u201335.6) to 39 (range 24.3\u201343.2) p=0.005. Clinical responses were as follows: 3 CR/CRu; 7 PR; 2 MR. One patient is in stable disease after 3 cycles of CHOP-R. With a median follow-up of 8 (range 3\u201328) months, no patient has progressed. Therapy was well tolerated for most patients. Two patients had febrile neutropenia with documented bacteremia and recovered without any complication. Circulating effector cell levels pre- and post-CHOP-R were also evaluated in 6 patients since rituximab activity is mediated in part by ADCC activity. No significant change in CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , and CD16 + /CD56 + effector cell levels occurred following CHOP-R as assessed by multicolor flow cytometry.",
