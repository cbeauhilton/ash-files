    "abstract_text": "The phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) have emerged as important therapeutic targets for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. In hematological cancer therapy, the majority of clinical activity has centered on the inhibition of the class IA isoform p110\u03b4 and the class IB enzyme p110\u03b3, whereas for solid tumor treatment the landscape has been dominated by inhibitors of all four class I PI3Ks (p110\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4 and \u03b3) or dual class I/mTOR inhibitors of limited selectivity. Our research has focused on the emerging role of p110\u03b2 and p110\u03b4 in both cancer types, in which overexpression, mutation and PTEN-defectiveness have been shown to be key features in disease pathogenesis and progression. We have designed and developed a uniquely selective series of small molecules that inhibit the p110\u03b2/\u03b4 isoforms, and which display extremely high specificity in the human kinome. The design of such molecules has enabled us to interrogate the function of p110\u03b4 in tumor immunotherapy and p110\u03b2 in primary tumor growth and metastasis; our lead compounds show promising oral activity in syngeneic models, in which they inhibit tumor growth and metastatic spread whilst also impacting on downstream biomarker responses. Additionally, through our ability to tune selectivity over p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b3, elimination of the mechanism-related toxicities associated with those isoforms can be realized, making selective dual p110\u03b2/\u03b4 inhibition potentially more conducive to combination therapy than for pan-PI3K inhibitors. Described herein is data for our clinical development candidate, KA2237, which is an orally-active, potent and selective p110\u03b2/\u03b4 inhibitor. This molecule displays potent in vitro growth inhibition and PD responses in a spectrum of hematological tumor lines, including in MCL and PTEN-null GCB-DLBCL, and has potential to treat BTK inhibitor-resistant malignancies of the hematopoietic system. KA2237 will enter Phase I studies in hematological cancer at the end of 2015. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
