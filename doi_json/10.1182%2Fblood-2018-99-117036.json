    "abstract_text": "Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) remains a leading cause of non-relapse mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). The imbalance between T effector (Teffs) and regulatory cells (Tregs) is a defined characteristic of GvHD. Therefore, promoting Tregs for controlling GvHD has drawn an intense interest in preclinical and clinical studies of allo-HCT. Although CD4 Tregs (CD4 + Foxp3 + ) have been shown to effectively prevent GvHD, they impaired graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Our lab has previously demonstrated that CD8 iTregs (CD8 + Foxp3 + ) not only suppressed allogeneic T-cell responses, but also possessed the GVL activity themselves. However, instability of Foxp3 in CD8 iTregs is a major obstacle to translate this Treg population into clinic application. Vitamin C has been reported to promote Foxp3 stability by accelerating its demethylation. In the current study, we asked whether vitamin C could stabilize CD8 iTregs and enhance their therapeutic potential in controlling GvHD. Addition of vitamin C in the culture significantly increased the generation of allo-reactive CD8 iTregs in vitro ( Fig. 1A ). These CD8 iTregs generated with vitamin C had strikingly increased demethylation on Foxp3 CpGs ( Fig. 1B ) and superior suppressive activity (data not shown) compared to control-treated CD8 iTregs. We further evaluated the capability of vitamin C-treated CD8 iTregs in preventing GvHD in allo-HCT. Using a MHC-mismatched murine BMT model, vitamin C-treated CD8 iTregs could significantly alleviate GvHD reflected by a marked reduction of recipient mortality ( Fig. 1C ) and clinical scores (data not shown). To determine the Foxp3 stability in vivo , we analyzed the transferred CD8 iTregs and allogeneic Teffs in recipient spleens 7 days after allo-HCT. Vitamin C-treated CD8 iTregs (Ly5.2 + ) remarkably suppressed Teff (Ly5.1 + ) expansion and maintained higher Foxp3 expression compared to the control iTregs ( Fig. 1D ). To address a critical question whether vitamin C-treated CD8 iTregs can preserve the GVL activity, we performed a haploidentical transplant with a leukemia relapse model, and found that vitamin C-treated CD8 iTregs not only attenuated GvHD severity, but also prevented recipients from tumor relapse ( Fig. 1E ). In conclusion, our studies provide a rationale and mean to use stabilized CD8 iTregs with vitamin C for controlling GvHD and leukemia relapse in the clinic.
