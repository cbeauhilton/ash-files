    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2854 Poster Board II-830 Targeting the cell cycle in combination with cytotoxic killing is a rational approach to cancer therapy. Progression in multiple myeloma (MM) stems from both loss of apoptotic control in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment and dysregulation of the cyclindependent kinases (CDK)4 and CDK6, which precedes uncontrolled proliferation of myeloma cells in vivo in particular during relapse. This reinforces the critical importance of targeting CDK4/CDK6 in MM. Through selective and reversible inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 with PD 0332991, the only known CDK4/6-specific inhibitor, we have recently developed a novel strategy to sensitize primary myeloma cells for cytotoxic killing by diverse cytotoxic drugs. These include carfilzomib (PR-171), an irreversible selective inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome, and PR-047, an orally bioavailable analog of carfilzomib. We showed that induction of prolonged early G1 arrest following inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 markedly enhances cytotoxic killing of primary BM myeloma cells by either carfilzomib or PR-047 despite protection by BM stromal cells. The enhancement of cytotoxic killing is further augmented during synchronous S phase entry upon removal of PD 0332991 subsequent to induction of prolonged G1 arrest in myeloma cell lines. In both cases, the enhancement in carfilzomib (or PR-047) mediated killing is not associated with cell cycle regulation of the proteasome activity. It is caspase-dependent, requiring only a brief (one hour) exposure to the proteasome inhibitor at concentrations as low as 30 nM. This killing is mediated by synergistic and rapid induction of mitochondrial membrane depolarization and activation of downstream caspase-9. Further, it is apparently initiated by cell cycle-dependent expression of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, which neutralize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins upstream of mitochondrial depolarization. Bim is upregulated during early G1 arrest to neutralize the anti-apoptotic MCL-1 and Bcl-2. By contrast, Noxa is silenced in G1 but dramatically upregulated in S phase, in particular when combined with carfilzomib. Importantly, targeting CDK4/CDK6 with PD 0332991 in combination with either carfilzomib or PR-047 leads to complete eradication of myeloma cells ex vivo , in contrast to the combination of PD 0332991 with other proteasome inhibitors. Selective inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 in combination with carfilzomib (or PR-047), therefore, not only halts tumor cell proliferation but also potently induces synergistic killing that is likely to profoundly inhibit cell cycle reentry and self-renewal in MM. PD 0332991 is a small molecule with bio-availability and proven tumor suppressing activity in both human myeloma xenograft and immunocompetent mouse myeloma models. It is well tolerated in humans as indicated by the ongoing Phase I/II clinical trials in myeloma and previous phase I trials in mantle cell lymphoma and solid tumors. Evidence from Phase 2 trials of carfilzomib indicates that it is also well tolerated, in fact, the peripheral neuropathy that is commonly observed with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib appears to be less severe and possibly less frequent. Mechanism-based targeting of CDK4/6 in combination with selective proteasome inhibitors, like carfilzomib and PR-047, thus represents a new and promising therapeutic strategy for multiple myeloma and potentially other hematopoietic malignancies.
