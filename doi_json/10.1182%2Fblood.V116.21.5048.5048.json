    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5048 Thalidomide, an immunomodulating drug with antiangiogenic activity, is an efficacious therapeutic option for unfit patients with multiple myeloma. Its efficacy may be increased by the addiction of steroids or other cytotoxic drugs such melphalan or cyclophosphamide. In this study we assessed the efficacy and toxicity of thalidomide based regimens as savage therapy in a series of elderly patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Previous treatments included at least one therapy (range 1\u20134), such as high dose dexamethasone, alkylating agents, anthracyclines, IFN-\u03b1 and autologous graft. Thalidomide 50\u2013200 mg/die was administered orally in a total of 16 patients (median age 73.8 years, range 59\u201384) with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma observed in our Hematology Department between May 2004 and January 2010. Oral dexamethasone or prednisone was added to the treatment. All patients continued therapy until relapse or progression and were prospectively followed-up including accurate monitoring of side effects. Response to thalidomide was assessed according to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria. The median follow-up time was 25.6 months (range 8 \u2013 68). Overall response rate was 81.2% (13/16 patients) with a median duration of response of 26.7 months (range 7 \u2013 67): 3 patients showed a very good partial remission, 10 partial response, 1 stable disease and 2 progression of disease. During follow-up, 6 patients died (3 due to progression, 2 due to other neoplasm, 1 due to heart failure), 10 patients are still alive (2 VGPR and 7 PR in continuous therapy, 1 PD in third line therapy). No response was observed in 3/16 patients (18.7%). Despite the following side effects, mild to moderate bradycardia (25%, 1 needed PMK positioning and 1 dose reduction), peripheral sensitive polyneuropathy (18.7%) and constipation (6%), no patient discontinued therapy. This study shows that thalidomide based regimens are an effective therapy with a high response rate and manageable side effects when used in patient with multiple myeloma with relapsed/refractory disease.
