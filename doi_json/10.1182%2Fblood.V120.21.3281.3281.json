    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3281 Regulatory \u03b3\u03b4T cells (\u03b3\u03b4Tregs) are capable of suppressing T-cell activation and proliferation (Rita et al Journal of immunology 2009). Our previous studies demonstrated the immunosuppressive features of \u03b3\u03b4Tregs and further supported the use of \u03b3\u03b4Tregs as a promising therapeutic strategy for the adoptive immunotherapy of allograft rejection, post-transplantation graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and autoimmune diseases (Hu et al ASH abstract 2011). To this end, large-scale, efficient expansion of \u03b3\u03b4Tregs represents a fundamentally important prerequisite for their clinical application. Here we explored the efficacy of decitabine (a DNA hypomethylating agent) for the generation of functional \u03b3\u03b4Tregs and its underlying mechanisms. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured with interleukin (IL)-2, IL-15, TGF-\u03b21 and zoledronic acid (ZOL). Decitabine was added to aliquots of PBMCs. Frequency and absolute number of \u03b3\u03b4Tregs were investigated by flow cytometry (FACS) and trypan blue live-cell counts after cultivation. Our results showed a higher frequency (61.9\u00b110.3% versus 38.4\u00b17.8%, p<0.01) and absolute number of \u03b3\u03b4Tregs [(3.1\u00b10.1)\u00d710 6 versus (5.9\u00b10.2)\u00d710 6 , p<0.01] were seen in cells treated with decitabine plus ZOL/IL-2/IL-15/TGF-\u03b21 (referred to as decitabine-induced \u03b3\u03b4Tregs below) than in cell without decitabine induction (referred to as common \u03b3\u03b4Tregs) as shown in Fig. 1 . These data demonstrated that decitabine and ZOL/cytokines synergized to induce stable \u03b3\u03b4Tregs via improved Foxp3 expression. Next we analyzed the underlying mechanisms of decitabine on \u03b3\u03b4Treg induction. Genomic DNA was isolated from \u03b3\u03b4Tregs sorted by FACS. The Foxp3 gene methyaltion status of upstream enhancer CpG islands from \u22125995 to \u22125778 and from \u22125031 to \u22124792, proximal promoter CpG island from -139 to -15 and non-coding DNA sequence 3 (CNS3) CpG island from 3748 to 3971 was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing. We found decitabine-induced \u03b3\u03b4Tregs displayed efficient CpG demethylation of the upstream enhancer from \u22125031 to \u22124792, and of CNS3 from 3748 to 3971, but no differences were detected in the other CpG islands investigated in contrast to common \u03b3\u03b4Tregs ( Fig. 2 A). We subsequently investigated if DNA demethylation of CpG islands could influence upstream enhancer or CNS3 activity to promote Foxp3 transcription. The upstream enhancer from \u22125031 to \u22124792 and CNS3 from 3748 to 3971 were methylated using SssI (CpG) methylase, and methylated or unmethylated sequences were inserted into demethylated pFoxP3Pro, respectively. Vectors were added to \u03b3\u03b4T cells and electroporated using the T-023 program of the Nucleofector. Dual fluorescence-based transient reporter assays showed an obvious reduction in luciferase activity after methylation of both CpG islands, but not with the demethylated CpG islands ( Fig. 2 B), indicating that demethylation of the upstream enhancer and CNS3 can promote Foxp3 expression via increased enhancer activity. Transcription factors (TF) play important roles in gene expression. To test whether decitabine enhanced specific TFs expression to influence \u03b3\u03b4Treg induction, we performed TF CHIP assays in FACS-sorted common \u03b3\u03b4Tregs versus decitabine-induced \u03b3\u03b4Tregs. The expression levels of 245 TFs were evaluated and the result showed that NF-\u03bab expression in decitabine-induced \u03b3\u03b4Tregs was up-regulated 50 times in contrast to that in common \u03b3\u03b4Tregs. NF-\u03bab up-regulation was further comfirmed by western blot analysis from 6 different healthy volunteers. Finally, We evaluated the immunosuppressive function of the enriched \u03b3\u03b4Tregs on Carboxyfluorescein Diacetate (CFSE)-labeled hPBMC proliferation and activation stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies for 5 days in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3 , both common \u03b3\u03b4Tregs and decitabine-induced \u03b3\u03b4Tregs exerted dose-dependent suppression of proliferation, but decitabine-induced \u03b3\u03b4Tregs had a greater suppressive effect than common \u03b3\u03b4Tregs. In conclusion, these data demonstrate for the first time that decitabine facilitates the generation of functional \u03b3\u03b4Tregs via foxp3 gene demethylation and NF-\u03bab up-regulation. Futhermore, our results lay the foundation for large-scale availability of induced \u03b3\u03b4Tregs for potential clinical applications, and reveal novel targets for regulating Foxp3 expression in \u03b3\u03b4T cells.
