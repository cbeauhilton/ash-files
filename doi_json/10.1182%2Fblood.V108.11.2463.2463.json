    "abstract_text": "Background: Nodal aggressive PTCL have a poor prognosis with conventional chemotherapy regimens for aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Therefore innovative approaches are needed. Among them, strategies including consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation in front line therapy may improve the outcome of these diseases. Aim: To report the experience of a national cooperative group in 26 patients with aggressive nodal PTCL who underwent treatment including ASCT as consolidation of front line therapy. Patients and Methods: Twenty-six patients Gallium scan positive with nodal PTCL entered into the study: 11 cases of PTCL-unspecified (42%), 8 ALCL (31%) and 7 AIL (27%). Patients received three courses of MegaCHOP and subsequently were evaluated by CT scan and Gallium scan. Those patients Gallium scan negative received another course of MegaCHOP and then the transplant. Those patients Gallium scan positive after 3 courses of MegaCHOP received 2 courses of the IFE regimen (Ifosfamide 3.3g/m2 days 1\u20133 and Etoposide 300 mg/m2 days 1\u20133) and if at least achieved a partial response received the transplant otherwise they are out of the study. Median age was 44 years, 96% of the patients presented Ann Arbor stage III or IV; 54% presented B symptoms; 31% bone marrow involvement and 72% of the patients presented 2\u20133 factors of the a-IPI. Results: Thirteen patients (50%) achieved a CR after 3 courses of MegaCHOP and 12 patients received IFE as salvage therapy. Twenty patients out of the 26 initial patients were able to proceed to the transplant. After the transplant 85% of patients achieved a CR. The 6 patients who did not received the transplant was due to progression of the disease in 4 cases, lethal toxicity in one case and refusal in another case. With a median follow up of 35 months for alive patients, the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) at 3 years were 73% and 53%, respectively. OS, PFS and disease-free survival for the 20 patients who underwent the ASCT consolidation was 84%, 53% and 63%, respectively. Conclusion: Early salvage therapy for patients not in CR after 3 courses of chemotherapy and ASCT consolidation for chemosensitive patients may improve the outcome of patients with nodal aggressive PTCL. Larger series and longer follow up are needed to confirm this promising approach."
