    "abstract_text": "Imatinib (IM) treatment causes remission in a majority of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) but relapses remain a problem. The frequent presence in relapsing cells of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations suggests that their prior but undetected acquisition by rare CML stem cells may be a major contributor to IM treatment failures. We have recently demonstrated that enriched populations of CML stem cells (lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 \u2212 cells) are relatively insensitive to IM and possess multiple unique features that would be expected to promote both innate and acquired mechanisms of resistance to BCR-ABL -targeted therapeutics. These include elevated BCR-ABL expression and tyrosine kinase activity, increased expression of ABCB1/MDR1 and ABCG2 , decreased expression of OCT1 , and a high degree of genetic instability, as demonstrated by a rapid accumulation of BCR-ABL mutations in vitro. To determine whether these parameters may be predictive of clinical responses to IM, immunomagnetically selected CD34 + stem/progenitor cells from 18 chronic phase CML patients\u2019 samples obtained prior to IM therapy were evaluated and the results compared with subsequent clinical responses. Direct sequencing of transcripts cloned from extracts of freshly isolated CD34 + cells (10 clones/sample) detected a high frequency of pre-existing BCR-ABL kinase mutations in the CD34 + cells from 12 of 12 patients regardless of their subsequent IM responses (20\u201380%). Interestingly, a higher incidence of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations was found in 5 IM-nonresponders (33\u201380% of transcripts showed \u22651 BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation) as compared to 5 IM-responders (values of 20-30%, P<0.02). A higher frequency of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations was also detected in extracts of colonies generated from assays of cells harvested from 3-week suspension cultures initiated with the same starting CD34 + CML cells (21\u201368% vs 10\u201343%). A high incidence of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations was also documented in freshly isolated or cultured CD34 + cells from 2 patients who developed sudden blast crisis (50\u201363% and 17\u201383%). Overall, 38 different mutations were identified from freshly isolated CD34 + CML cells and >50 additional mutations were identified in the progeny of CD34 + CML cells cultured \u00b1 IM. These included 15 point mutations frequently associated with clinical IM resistance (including G250, Q252, E255, T315, M351, F359 and H396) and >40 mutations not previously described. Furthermore, freshly isolated CD34 + cells from IM-nonresponders (including the 2 patients who developed blast crisis, n=10) showed a greater resistance to IM in vitro (\u223c2 fold, P< 0.001 with 5 \u03bcM and P<0.02 with 10 \u03bcM IM) as compared to CD34 + cells from IM-responders (n=8) in the presence of 5 and 10 \u03bcM IM, as determined by colony-forming cell (CFC) assays. Although more IM-resistant CFCs were obtained in the presence of IM from 3-week cultures initiated with CD34 + cells from the same IM-nonresponders than from IM responders, these latter differences were not significantly different (P= 0.28). These results suggest that the CD34 + leukemic cells from individual chronic phase CML patients harbor differences in their biologic properties that are predictive of how they will respond to IM therapy and that assessment of these differences may form the basis of rapid, practical and quantitative tests to assist in optimized patient management."
