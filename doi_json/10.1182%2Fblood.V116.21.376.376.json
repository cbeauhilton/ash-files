    "abstract_text": "Abstract 376 CLL is characterized by a dynamic imbalance between the proliferation and apoptosis of neoplastic B-lymphocytes co-expressing CD5 and CD19 antigens. Several mechanisms provide CLL cells with survival advantage. One such mechanism involves the activation of NF-\u03baB. NF-\u03baB plays an important role in the survival and proliferation of normal and neoplastic B cells. In CLL, the NF-\u03baB p65/p50 dimers have been found to be activated to variable degrees by several investigators. The activation of NF-\u03baB is mediated by either the canonical pathway or the alternative pathway. The canonical pathway is mainly activated by extracellular factors that activate the \u03b2 subunit of the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex (IKK\u03b2) that induces the phosphorylation and degradation of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1. Following I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, NF-\u03baB heterodimers translocate to the nucleus and bind to DNA. To determine whether NF-\u03baB is activated in CLL and explore the mechanism(s) that activate it, we obtained peripheral blood low density cells from untreated and previously treated patients with CLL at different stages of their disease. First we studied peripheral blood low-density cells of 15 patients using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). We found that in all samples the NF-\u03baB dimers p65/p50 bound DNA, regardless of CLL patients' disease stage or treatment status. Typically, NF-\u03baB-DNA binding appears and disappears due to repeated degradation and re-synthesis of I\u03baB and the consequent activation and inactivation of NF-\u03baB, respectively. Because we found that NF-\u03baB is constitutively activated in all CLL samples we hypothesized that activation of NF-\u03baB in CLL cells is induced by an I\u03baB-unrelated mechanism. Recently, Yang J et al (Cancer Res 65:939, 2005) reported that unphosphorylated (U)-STAT3 binds to the NF-\u03baB dimers p65/p50 in competition with I\u03baB. The U-STAT3/NF-\u03baB complex shuttles to the nucleus where NF-\u03baB binds to DNA and activates NF-\u03baB-regulated genes. We recently found that CLL cells harbor high levels of U-STAT3 (Hazan-Halevy I et al, Blood 115:2852, 2010). Therefore, we sought to determine whether U-STAT3 activates NF-\u03baB in CLL cells. By using immunoprecipitation we found that STAT3 binds the NF-\u03baB p65 form in 3 out of 3 different peripheral blood CLL samples, and by using confocal microscopy we demonstrated that U-STAT3/NF-\u03baB complexes are present in the nuclei of CLL cells. Then, to determine whether STAT3 is required for NF-\u03baB activation, we infected CLL cells with retroviral STAT3-short hairpin (sh) RNA, and by using EMSA found that STAT3-shRNA, but not the empty virus, attenuated the binding of NF-\u03baB to DNA. Furthermore, by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction we demonstrated that STAT3-shRNA downregulated mRNA levels of genes known to be activated by NF-\u03baB but not by STAT3 such as STAT1, CCL5 and CXCR5. Taken together, our data suggest that U-STAT3 binds the NF-\u03baB dimers p65/p50 and constitutively activates NF-\u03baB in CLL cells. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
