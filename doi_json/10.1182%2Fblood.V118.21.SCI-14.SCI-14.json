    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-14 Notch is a highly conserved signaling pathway with multiple functions in health and disease. In the hematopoietic system, Notch was first described for its essential role at early stages of T cell development in the thymus and for its involvement in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In addition, Notch is being increasingly recognized as a potent regulator of antigen-driven mature T cell responses with context-dependent effects. These effects are influenced by the regulated expression of Jagged and Delta-like Notch ligands in antigen-presenting cells under the control of Toll-like receptors and other innate signals. We are investigating the importance of the Notch pathway in T cell alloimmunity in the setting of allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-BMT). After allo-BMT, alloimmune T cell responses mediate beneficial graft-versus-tumor (GVT) activity as well as detrimental graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Using the pan-Notch inhibitor DNMAML and other genetic models of Notch inhibition, we have discovered an essential function for Notch signaling in donor-derived alloreactive T cells. In multiple mouse models of allo-BMT, infusion of Notch-deficient T cells as compared to wild-type T cells led to dramatically reduced GVHD severity and lethality. This effect was apparent for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and did not involve global immunosuppression, since Notch-deficient T cells proliferated normally and expanded in host lymphohematopoietic organs. However, Notch-deficient donor T cells failed to accumulate in the gut, a key GVHD target organ, and produced markedly decreased amounts of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2. In parallel, Notch inhibition was associated with increased accumulation of FoxP3+CD4+ T cells. Decreased cytokine production could not be explained by a classical T helper differentiation defect. In contrast to their defective induction of GVHD, Notch-deficient T cells remained capable of mediating cytotoxic and anti-tumor responses both in vitro and in vivo , leading to preserved GVT activity even against large numbers of tumor cells. We are currently investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of Notch action in alloreactive T cells. We are also exploring the role of individual Notch receptors and ligands at the alloimmune synapse in vivo . Altogether, our findings identify Notch inhibition in donor T cells as a novel strategy to induce beneficial immunomodulation rather than global immunosuppression after allo-BMT.
