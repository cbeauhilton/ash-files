    "abstract_text": "Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are a promising candidate for molecular-targeted therapy for leukemia. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of cytotoxic effects of depsipeptide (FK228), one of the most effective HDAC inhibitors against leukemia, using human myeloid leukemic cell lines HL-60 and K562. We found that FK228 activated caspase-9 and a subsequent caspase cascade by perturbing the mitochondrial membrane to release cytochrome c , which was almost completely blocked by overexpression of Bcl-2. The mitochondrial damage was caused by the translocation of Bax but not other proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins to the mitochondria. FK228 did not affect the interaction between Bax and Bax-adaptor proteins such as 14\u20133\u20133 theta and Ku70. FK228-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial translocation of Bax were markedly enhanced by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. The synergistic action of FK228 and Bortezomib was at least partly mediated through conformational changes of Bax, which facilitate its translocation to the mitochondria. These results suggest that the combination of HDAC inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors is useful for the treatment of leukemia especially in the context of molecular-targeted therapy. The status of Bcl-2 and Bax may influence the sensitivity of tumors to this combination, and thus, can be a target of further therapeutic intervention.",
