    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4404 Objective: To measure the expressions of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR, CD114) and stem cell factor receptor (C-KIT, CD117) on the membrane of CD34+CD59\u2212 and CD34+CD59+ bone marrow cells of the patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria(PNH), and the signaling pathway protein STAT5 within the cytoplasm of those cells. Methods: The expressions of CD114 and CD117 on the cell membrane and STAT5 protein within the cytoplasm of bone marrow CD34+CD59+ and CD34+CD59\u2212 cells from 26 PNH patients and 14 normal controls were examined by flow cytometry (FCM). Results: The percentage of CD114 positive cells in CD34+CD59\u2212 cells of PNH patients was (43.23\u00b119.77)%,which was significantly lower than that in CD34+CD59+ cells of PNH patients (73.72\u00b117.42) (P0.05). The percentage of CD117 positive cells in CD34+CD59\u2212 cells of PNH patients was (49.20\u00b126.80)%,which was significantly lower than that in CD34+CD59+ cells of PNH patients (67.62\u00b117.41) (P0.05). The STAT5 MFI in CD34+CD59\u2212 and CD34+CD59+ cells of PNH patients and CD34+CD59+ cells of normal controls was (270.01\u00b1181.26), (205.05\u00b1146.16), (227.39\u00b1156.65) respectively. There was no statistic difference among the three groups (P>0.05). Conclusions: In PNH, CD114 and CD117 expressed lower on bone marrow PNH clone cells than normal clone cells, but the expressions of signaling pathway protein STAT5 within the cytoplasm was normal.
