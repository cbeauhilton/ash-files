    "abstract_text": "Background: The major cause of severe neonatal allo-immune thrombocytopenia (NAITP) in Caucasians is fetal-maternal incompatibility for the human platelet antigen-1 (HPA-1), which is determined by the dimorphism Leu (HPA-1a) or Pro (HPA-1b) at amino acid position 33 of \u03b23 integrin glycoprotein IIIa. Maternal responsiveness to HPA-1a shows a very strong association with DR52a (DRB3*0101) and 33 Leu is thought to create a binding motif for this MHC class II molecule, thereby conferring helper T-cell responsiveness. At present, there are no preventative measures, reliable predictors of severity or screening procedures to identify women at risk of HPA-1a alloimmunization. Since the T-cells that help HPA-1a antibody production represent an attractive target for both screening assays and specific therapy, the aim was to define the epitope(s) they recognize in detail. Methods: From the peripheral blood of three HLA DR52a positive mothers with anti-HPA-1a antibodies and affected babies, we generated a total of six stable long-term CD4 + T-cell clones that respond specifically to the HPA-1a + glycoprotein sequence. They have enabled us to characterize, for the first time, the fine specificity and restriction of the HPA-1a helper epitope. The core epitope was mapped by testing the responsiveness (proliferation and cytokine production) of the clones to panels of synthetic peptides spanning the HPA-1a 33 Leu polymorphism, including sequences of different lengths, with selected single amino acid substitutions, and with the polymorphic residue located at different positions. Restriction was defined using antigen-presenting cells sharing HLA-DR and by flow cytometric analysis of staining with peptide-DR52a tetramers. The results, together with structural analyses, were used to model the interactions between MHC class II, HPA-1a peptide and specific helper T-cell receptor. Results: The 6 Th clones showed clear specificity for their HPA-1a epitope, even when naturally processed from whole platelets; they recognized only GPIIIa peptides (or platelets) with 33 Leu and not 33 Pro. The results of screening panels of linear peptides with 33 Leu at different positions are consistent with a \u201ccore\u201d epitope of 25 WCSDEALP L 33 . The clones also specifically bound tetramerized DR52a complexed with a peptide spanning these residues. Together, the results show that 25 Trp, 28 Asp and 33 Leu of HPA-1a are each important for anchoring respectively in pockets 1, 4 and 9 in DR52a, whereas 33 Pro of HPA-1b sterically hinders docking in pocket 9. Extra residues 34 Gly- 35 Ser did not affect T-cell recognition, but certain clones preferred N-terminal 24 Ala or 23 Cys- 24 Ala extensions. It has been previously reported that T-cells from alloimunized women with anti-HPA-1a recognize a 33 Leu peptide cyclized by disulfide bridges (circular-Leu; 26 C*SDEALP L GSPRC* 38 ) but not to the circularized 33 Pro equivalent. Our T-cell clones also responded moderately to this circular- 33 Leu peptide, demonstrating that 25 Trp anchor at pocket 1 may not be essential when anchoring in pocket 4 and 9 are strong. Conclusions: Characterization of the HPA-1a specific Th clones reveals that they all recognize the core epitope GPIIIa 25 Trp- 33 Leu, with the polymorphic 33 Leu selectively anchoring it in the strongly predisposing HLA-DR52a. Although predicted to lie outside the peptide-binding groove of DR52a, extra N-terminal sequences promote optimal recognition by some T-cells, but are no longer required if the sequence is cyclized. Despite differences in TCR gene usage, the clones show remarkable consistency in fine specificity, supporting our previous evidence from polyclonal T-cell responses from women with anti-HPA-1a antibodies. The identification of a single \u201ccore\u201d epitope, and the uniformity of restriction by DR52a in alloimmunized women, opens the way to both diagnostic and therapeutic exploitation in NAITP due to anti-HPA-1a.",
