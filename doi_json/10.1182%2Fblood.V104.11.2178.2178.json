    "abstract_text": "In the hematopoietic system, TGF-\u03b21 is one of the most potent extrinsic regulators, affecting both early progenitors and committed cells. At the top of the hematopoietic hierarchy, TGF-\u03b21 maintains hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in quiescence in vitro through transcriptional regulation of genes encoding proteins important in the cell cycle. We have shown that TGF- \u03b2 receptor I (T \u03b2 RI) \u2212 / \u2212 HSCs exhibit increased proliferative capacity in vitro and that T \u03b2 RII \u2212 / \u2212 mice develop a multifocal autoimmune disease, mainly mediated by T-cells (Larsson et al, 2003, Leve\u0301en et al 2002). The mechanisms of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in hematopoietic cells are poorly understood and many target genes of TGF-\u03b2 signaling remain elusive. In this study we have used global gene expression analysis to investigate whether all TGF-\u03b2 signaling is mediated by T\u03b2RI and II. Furthermore, we asked what target genes are affected upon TGF-\u03b2 stimulation in normal and TGF-\u03b2 signaling deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). MEFs were grown with and without TGF-\u03b21 stimulation and proliferation, transcriptional responses and expression analysis were performed. We demonstrate through Western Blot analysis, luciferase reporter assays and cell expansion experiments how these cells lack functional T\u03b2RI. Additionally, transcriptional assays show that no other Smad activity is triggered by TGF-\u03b21 stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate through quantitative RT-PCR that the inhibitor of differentiation family of genes, known targets of TGF-\u03b2 signaling, are not affected by TGF-\u03b21 in T \u03b2 RI \u2212 / \u2212 MEFs, while wt cells downregulate these genes 4\u20138.5 fold in response to stimulation. In order to completely exclude alternative receptors outside the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily and signaling pathways activated through T\u03b2RII alone, we performed global gene expression profiling on TGF-\u03b21 stimulated T \u03b2 RI \u2212 / \u2212 MEFs with unstimulated T\u03b2RI deficient cells as reference. Very few (0.05 %) of the more than 37,000 spots on the microarray had a >2 fold differential expression in the two experiments conducted. Similar experiments performed on wt cells resulted in differential expression of between 2.6\u20133.9 % of the genes printed. From this data we conclude that no signaling affecting gene expression occur in the absence of T\u03b2RI in these cells. Additionally we present transcriptional profiles of MEF cell lines that either are normal or are T\u03b2RI deficient. By means of cDNA microarray technology, we have identified genes that were differentially expressed when T\u03b2RI deficient fibroblasts were compared to wt cells stimulated with TGF-\u03b21. Our results create a data base of 461 significantly differentially expressed (p<0.01) target genes of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. These include genes potentially responsible for the growth arrest induced by TGF-\u03b21, like Gadd45g, Gas5, Id1, Id2 and Id3 . However, the most significantly enriched number of differentially expressed genes are involved in protein folding and chaperone activities ( Hspa9a, Hsp105, Hspe1, Hsp60, Cct2, Cct3, Cct8, Tcp1 and Dnaja1 . Studies to identify TGF-\u03b2 signaling responsive genes in HSCs are in progress.",
