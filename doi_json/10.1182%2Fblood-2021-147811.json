    "abstract_text": "Introduction Fanconi anemia (FA) is the most frequent inherited DNA-repair disease in human, driving hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) failure in children and a major predisposition to poor-prognosis myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute leukemia (AML) in children or young adults. MDS/AML secondary to FA have a dismal prognosis in this frail population with a high chemotherapy-related toxicity. How bone marrow (BM) cells progress to myeloid malignancies in a background of cell intrinsic genomic instability and stem cell exhaustion is still poorly understood. Here we aimed to identify the molecular and functional determinants of BM progression to MDS/AML in FA patients. Methods We studied a cohort of 335 FA patients, representing virtually all FA patients seen in France from 2002 to 2020. We performed longitudinal clinical studies (cytopenia, BM morphology and staging, HSCT, survival), somatic genomics (karyotype, myeloid cancer gene panel, aCGH, WES, WGS), expression analysis by RNAseq on clonal cells, and functional studies (gene modulation in HSPCs, transgenic MDM4 mice, CFU and competitive engraftment experiments). Paired clonal BM and skin fibroblasts samples were available for 62 MDS/AML FA patients; WES and WGS files from age-matched non FA MDS/AML were used as controls. Results 98 out of 335 patients (29%) experienced clonal evolution, first seen at a median age of 13y, including 51 (15%) with blastic evolution (>5% BM blasts, median age 16y). Unbalanced chromosomal translocations rather than point mutations underlaid clonal evolution in comparison to age-matched, sporadic (non-FA) AML cases. The most prominent driver lesion was chromosome 1q duplication (1q+), found in 52% of the clonal FA patients, while other recurrent lesions were gain of 3q (3q+/EVI1; 40%), translocations/del/mut involving the RUNX1 gene (35%), monosomy 7/7q- (31%), and signaling gene mutations (18%). Based on longitudinal studies and ranking models, we evidenced that 1q+ occurred early, yielding preleukemic clonal hematopoiesis, whereas 3q+, -7/del7q, RUNX1 and signaling mutations occurred later along with BM transformation. Regarding genomic instability, WGS analysis of FA AML cells revealed a unique mutational signature that shares features with BRCA-related solid cancers [homologous recombination deficient (HRD)-type substitution signature, accumulation of small/intermediate-size deletions and large structural variants (SV)]. SV breakpoint analysis identified microhomology-mediated end joining (MM-EJ, also known as Alt-EJ) as the preferential DNA repair mechanism in the FA context. Specifically, a fragile site in the 1q pericentromeric repeated region underlaid 1q+ translocations. Next, we found that the MDM4 oncogene, a negative modulator of p53 response located in the minimal 1q duplicated region, was overexpressed in 1q+ but not in clonal non-1q FA cells. We hypothesized that 1q+ may attenuate the FA-associated p53 pathway hyperactivation through increased gene dosage of MDM4. Consistently, RNA-seq of patient cells before and after clonal progression showed p53 pathway activation before clonal evolution and subsequent p53 downregulation along with 1q+. When evaluated in vitro by CFU assay, lentiviral overexpression of MDM4 rescued clonogenicity defect of HSCPs from both FA patients and Fanc-/- mice, at the same level as TP53 knockdown. We produced a transgenic mouse bearing a duplicated Mdm4 locus and showed that MdM4 overexpression conferred an advantage to FA-like HSPCs in competitive transplant experiments, modeling clonal hematopoiesis. Exposure of 1q+ FA cells to Mdm4 inhibitors raised therapeutic potential. Conclusions The somatic genomic landscape of FA MDS/AML reveals a unique FA mutational signature, characterized by structural rearrangements and copy number abnormalities rather than point mutations. Our results define a canonical oncogenic route towards secondary MDS/AML in FA patients, in which the early modulation of the p53 pathway through 1q+/MDM4 oncogene overexpression plays a pivotal role, raising novel monitoring and therapeutic prospects for the FA patients.
