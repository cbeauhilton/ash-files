    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4558 Background: The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) for nonmalignant disease in our center. Method: Data were retrospectively collected for all patients (aged 0\u201318 years) who received allogeneic HSCT between May, 2005 and December, 2011. Outcomes according to the type of transplant, diagnosis, and transplant-related complications are reported. Result: Allo-HSCT was performed in 17 patients, (11 male; 6 female). Bone marrow Failure (7;41%) was the commonest nonmalignant disease followed by B-thalassemia major (4;24%) and others (6;35%). Only HLA-matched family donors were used. Most patients were conditioned with Busulfan/Cyclophosphamide/ATG. GVHD prophylaxis comprised mainly of cyclosporine and methotrexate. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 20 (9\u201327) days. Two patients experienced graft failure. Four patients had Grade (I\u2013III) aGVHD and no patient had grade (IV). Four patients (23%) had chronic GVHD. No patient had sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). Five patients had reactivation of CMV infection, which was treated and resolved in all of them. Only one patient died of sepsis. Overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) were 94%, and 88% respectively. Conclusion: In this cohort of patients, bone marrow failure was the main reason for transplantation. The early results of HSCT were promising and consistent with published international data. Similarly, graft failure remains a concern. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
