    "abstract_text": "Prior studies have demonstrated that MM cells with PTEN mutation and high AKT activity are more sensitive to inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the differential response to these agents are not well characterized. The objective of this study was to determine proteins that are different between MM cell lines with higher AKT activity (OPM2) and lower AKT activity (MM.1S) in response to the AKT inhibitor, perifosine. Methods: MM cell lines (MM.1S and OPM2) were treated with serial concentration of perifosine (KRX-0401, Keryx, NY, NY, provided by the NCI). Proteomic analysis using the nanoscale BD Clontech antibody-based protein microarray technique was performed using cells treated with perifosine (10uM for 16 hrs) or vehicle (sterile water) as control. Apoptosis was determined using Annexin V/PI FACS analysis at 24 and 48 hrs. The treatment time and concentration were chosen so that it did not induce more than 25% apoptosis to ensure adequate analysis of changes in signaling pathways. The antibody microarray is a technique that detects differences in protein abundance between the treated and control sample with each experiment by hybridizing fluorescently labeled (Cy3 and Cy5) protein mixtures onto slides spotted with 512 human monoclonal antibodies. Two microarray slides were used for each experiment. The slides were scanned using the Axon GenePix 4000B scanner. Two ratios were generated from the spot images for each protein target. The mean of the ratios of Cy5/Cy3 of both slides were analyzed using Clontech software and used to calculate an Internally Normalized Ratio (INR = (Ratio1/Ratio2, ratios 1 and 2 correspond to slides 1 and 2) for each spot on the array. The INR values were input into GeneSpring 6.0 software (Silicon Genetics, CA). The data was normalized to the mean INR of the two cell lines. Proteins whose expression level changed relative to control greater than 1.3 fold were determined. Unsupervised clustering demonstrated a different protein signature between MM.1S and OPM2 in response to perifosine. There were 144 proteins differentially expressed by 1.3 fold between MM.1S and OPM2. Proteins that were downregulated in OPM2 as compared to MM.1S included those in the PI3K pathway and cell cycle regulation such as PTEN, p70S6Kinase, the AKT substrate GSK-3, eEF-2 kinase, eIF-4g, Ku-80, cyclin A, E2F-2, CDK2, CDK7, and c-myc; proteins involved in apoptosis such as p21WAF, caspase 4 and 8, FADD, and PARP; kinases such as PKAc, PKA RI, ERK2, and JNK1; and other proteins regulating apoptosis and proliferation including p53, the NF-kB inhibitor IkB, and the heat shock protein HSP70. The nanoscale protein array is a useful and rapid technique that may be used to identify differences between resistant and sensitive cells to novel therapeutic agents. We identified proteins that are differentially expressed between MM cells sensitive and relatively resistant to the AKT inhibitor perifosine. Further analysis of the role of these proteins in the mechanism of resistance/sensitivity to perifosine is being performed. Future use of inhibitors of NF-kB (bortezomib) or heat shock protein inhibitors in conjunction with perifosine may overcome resistance induced by these proteins in MM cells with low AKT activity.
