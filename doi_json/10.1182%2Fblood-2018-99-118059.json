    "abstract_text": "Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is associated with global immunodeficiency, hypogammagobulinemia and T-cell exhaustion. We hypothesise that repairing T cell functions would improve cancer immune-editing, improve outcome and decrease infectious complications which cause significant morbidity in CLL patients. Chronic B-cell receptor (BCR) activation as well as close interactions with the tumour microenvironment promote survival of malignant CLL B-cells, supporting their ability to induce immune suppression. To date, the most clinically successful approach to BCR-signalling inhibition is by the use of BTK inhibitors (BTKi). It has been suggested that the BTKi Ibrutinib has the ability to modulate T-helper cell polarity from Th2 to Th1 and thus would be a step towards repairing CLL associated T-cell defects (1). We examined the impact of Ibrutinib on T cell function and immune phenotype in vivo in E\u00b5-TCL1 mice with CLL. Materials and Methods: C57/Bl6 animals 2.5 months of age were injected with 40x10e6 purified CLL B-cells pooled from E\u00b5-TCL1 mice with CLL. When peripheral blood CLL load reach >10% animals were randomized (mean day 14) to either vehicle treatment (2% HPBCD) or Ibrutinib treatment (0.15.mg/kg in 2% HPBCD) for 21 days. 17 animals per group were analysed. Splenic cells were isolated, the cellular component characterized by CyTOF and T cell function assessed by multi-parameter flow cytometry and T-cell synapse formation assay. We demonstrated that Ibrutinib administration this way led to high levels of BTK occupancy. Results: Treatment with both Ibrutinib resulted in increased expression of IL2 (p=0.0004) in CD4+ T cells and decreased expression of IL4 among both CD4+ T cells (p=0.0015) and CD8+ T-cells (p<0.0001). Interferon gamma production was reduced in CD4+ (p=0.0056) and CD8+ T-cells (p=0.0020) with Ibrutinib treatment, which also resulted in an increase in CD107a+/CD107a- ratio among both CD44+ (p=0.0002) and CD44- CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells (p=0.0463). Ibrutinib treatment increases T-cell synapse area (p<0.0001) (Figure 1). We find a trend towards less antigen experienced CD44+ T-cells with Ibrutinib treatment with decreased expression of PD-1 in both CD44+ and CD44- negative T-cells but more pronounced in the antigen experienced T-cells. (Figure 2A). In addition, decreased expression of immune checkpoint receptor KLRG-1 on antigen experienced CD44+ T-cells was observed, most pronounced in the CD4+ subsets (Figure 2 B). Among NK 1.1+ NK-cells we find a strong trend towards decreased expression of immune checkpoint receptor KLRG-1 (Figure 2C). In white pulp myelomonocytic splenocytes (WPMC) we find a shift away from Ly6c low macrophage/patrolling monocyte-like cells towards more Ly6C high inflammatory monocyte-like cells. Moreover, we find a trend towards decreased expression of PD-L1, which is highly expressed among Ly6c low cells and shows little to no expression among Ly6C high cells (Figure 2D). Conclusion: In vivo Ibrutinib treatment in this mouse model resulted in alteration in T cell function with cytokine secretion changes in keeping with a switch away from Th2 towards Th1 polarity as well as increased in cytotoxic T-cell function. The typical exhaustion phenotype of T-cell subsets is significantly ameliorated by Ibrutinib including a decrease in PD-1 expression. Moreover, we demonstrate a decrease in numbers of KLRG-1 high NK1.1+ NK cells. WPMC cells are shifted away from a potentially more tumour promoting Ly6C low PD-L1+ phenotype towards a more inflammatory Ly6c high PD-L1 low phenotype. These findings may point to a potential synergism of the combination of BTK inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade for the treatment of CLL.
