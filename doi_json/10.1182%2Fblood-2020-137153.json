Methods: This CME intervention comprised of a 30-minute online video-based roundtable discussion among experts in the field of cancer-associated thrombosis management. Responses to 3 multiple-choice, knowledge questions and 1 self-efficacy, 5-point Likert scale confidence question were analyzed using a repeated pairs pre-/post-assessment study design. A chi-square test (P <.05 is considered significant) assessed pre- to post-activity change . The activity launched December 23, 2019, and data were collected through February 24, 2020. Results: In total, 71 Hematologists/Oncologists were included in this study. Overall, there were knowledge and confidence improvements seen among all groups from pre- to post-assessment: 27% of hematologists/oncologists (P<.01) improved at identifying guideline-directed therapy regarding recommended thromboprophylaxis in patients with cancer per guideline recommendations. 27% of hematologists/oncologists (P<.01) improved at selecting guideline-appropriate treatment options for cancer-associated thrombosis. 44% of hematologists/oncologists had an increase in confidence in managing thrombosis in patients with cancer. Continued educational gaps: 25% of hematologists/oncologists failed to select guideline recommended DOAC therapy for thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients. 45% of hematologists/oncologists failed to select guideline recommended DOAC therapy for treatment of thrombosis in cancer patients. 66% of hematologists/oncologists still remain at only a rating of 1 to 3 on a scale of 1 to 5 in their confidence managing thrombosis in patients with cancer. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the success of online, CME-accredited, video-based roundtable discussion with experts in the field on significantly improving knowledge and confidence of hematologists/oncologists related to the guideline-recommended use of DOACs in the management of cancer-associated thrombosis. Continued gaps were also identified for future educational targets. Sources of support: Developed through an independent educational grant from Janssen in partnership with the University of Chicago.
