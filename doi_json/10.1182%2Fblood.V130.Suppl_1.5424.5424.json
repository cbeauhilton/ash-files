    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is frequently accompanied by renal impairment (RI) at diagnosis. As MM-specific therapeutic strategies have evolved drastically within the past decades, we aimed at delivering a re-evaluation of applied treatments and outcomes according to renal function at diagnosis. Methods: In this multicenter, retrospective cohort analysis, we analyzed 366 patients who were diagnosed with MM between 1997-2016 and subsequently underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). RI at diagnosis was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73m 2 . We carried out statistical analysis of patient groups stratified by renal function with regard to induction therapy defined as conventional chemotherapy (CT) versus immuno-chemotherapy (ICT) including either a proteasome inhibitor and/or an immunomodulator. Further, overall and progression-free survival (OS, PFS) were analyzed in the defined subgroups. Results: Of 366 patients, 287 received ICT versus 79 who had CT alone. The choice of the applied treatment strategy was highly dependent on diagnosis date, as all patients diagnosed before the year 2000 received chemotherapy alone, while all but 4 patients diagnosed after 2006 received ICT. Patients with renal impairment were just as likely to receive ICT as those without (75.9 vs. 79.5%, p=0.259). On OS analysis in the patient groups A) normal renal function/ICT (n=202), B) normal renal function/CT (n=52), C) impaired renal function/ICT (n=85), D) impaired renal function/CT (n=27), a longer survival was observed in groups A and B; however without statistical significance (p=0.080; Figure 1 ). On analysis of PFS, no differences were observed (p=0.784; Figure 2 ). Conclusions: Impaired renal function confers only a slight and statistically insignificant OS disadvantage in newly diagnosed MM patients receiving ASCT. On analysis of treatment strategy, however, it is evident that ICT attains better OS outcomes compared to CT alone. Therefore, while renal impairment remains common in patients with MM, an interdisciplinary mode of action between hemato/oncologists and nephrologists concerning the optimal induction therapy prior to ASCT is of pivotal clinical importance. The application of an adequate immuno-chemotherapy should conquer the fear of the negative impact of renal failure on outcome in patients with MM.
