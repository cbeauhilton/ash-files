    "abstract_text": "Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is an abundant platelet \u03b1-granule chemokine released following platelet activation. PF4 interacts with thrombomodulin and the \u03b3-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain of protein C to significantly enhance activated protein C (APC) generation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex on the surface of endothelial cells. However, the protein C Gla domain not only mediates protein C activation in vivo , but also plays a critical role in modulating the diverse functional properties of APC once generated. The functional consequences of the interaction between the APC Gla domain and PF4 in relation to APC anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic functions have not previously been fully defined. In a tissue factor-initiated thrombin generation assay, APC impaired thrombin generation as previously described. However PF4 inhibited APC anticoagulant activity in a concentration-dependent manner (IC 50 for PF4 inhibition of APC anticoagulant function, 11\u03bcg/ml). In contrast, addition of two other cationic polypeptides protamine and polybrene, both significantly enhanced APC anticoagulant activity in plasma. To elucidate the mechanism through which PF4 inhibits APC anticoagulant activity, we utilized a phospholipid-dependent FVa proteolysis time course assay. In the absence of protein S, PF4 had no effect upon FVa proteolysis by APC, indicating that PF4 does not influence the ability of APC to interact with either anionic phospholipids or FVa. However, in the presence of protein S, PF4 significantly inhibited APC-mediated FVa proteolysis (3\u20135 fold). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that in addition to enhancing APC generation, PF4 also significantly attenuates APC anticoagulant activity in plasma by impairing critical protein S cofactor enhancement of FVa proteolysis, and suggest that PF4 contributes to the poorly-understood APC resistance phenotype associated with activated platelets. APC bound to the endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) via its Gla domain can activate PAR-1 on endothelial cells, triggering complex intracellular signaling that result in anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic cellular responses. To ascertain whether PF4 interaction with the protein C/APC Gla domain might impair APC-EPCR-PAR-1 cytoprotective signaling, APC protection against thrombin-induced endothelial barrier permeability and staurosporine-induced apoptosis in the presence of PF4 was determined. APC significantly attenuated thrombin-induced endothelial cell barrier permeability, as expected. PF4 alone (up to 1\u03bcM) had no independent effect upon endothelial barrier permeability, and did not protect against thrombin-mediated increased permeability. In contrast to its inhibition of APC anticoagulant activity, PF4 did not significantly inhibit the endothelial barrier protective properties of APC. To determine whether PF4 might interfere with APC-mediated cytoprotection, staurosporine-induced apoptosis in EAhy926 cells was assessed by RT-PCR quantification of pro-apoptotic ( Bax ) to anti-apoptotic ( Bcl-2 ) gene expression. Pre-treatment of EAhy926 cells with APC decreased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio close to that determined for untreated EAhy926 cells. PF4 alone, or in combination with APC, had no effect upon apoptosis-related gene expression as determined by alteration of Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratios in response to staurosporine. In summary, PF4 inhibits APC anticoagulant function via inhibition of essential protein S cofactor enhancement in plasma, whilst retaining EPCR/PAR-1 mediated cytoprotective signalling on endothelial cells. This provides a rationale for how PF4 can exert prothrombotic effects in vivo , but also mediate enhanced APC generation on the surface of endothelial cells to induce both anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic events. Based on these observations, we propose that PF4 acts as a critical regulator of APC generation in vivo , but also targets APC towards cytoprotective, rather than anticoagulant functions at sites of vascular injury with concurrent platelet activation.",
