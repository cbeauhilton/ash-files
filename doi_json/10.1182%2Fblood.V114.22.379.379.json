    "abstract_text": "Abstract 379 Necdin, a member of MAGE (melanoma antigen) family proteins, is a growth suppressing protein that was first identified in post mitotic neurons. The gene encoding necdin is one of several deleted in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome, a neurobehavioural disorder associated with an increased risk of myeloid leukemia. It is reported that necdin interacts with p53 and represses p53-mediated apoptosis in neurons, but its role in hematopoiesis is largely unknown. Recently, we defined a critical role of p53 in regulating hematopoietic stem cell quiescence, and identified necdin as a target gene of p53, that is highly expressed in LT-HSCs (Liu Y et al., Cell Stem Cell, 2009). To define the role of necdin in hematopoiesis, we have analyzed the hematopoietic compartment of necdin-null mice. As necdin-null mice die perinatally, we first investigated fetal hematopoiesis and found no alteration in the frequency of fetal liver HSCs, defined as Lin - Sca1 + Mac1 + CD48 - CD150 + within the fetal liver cells. Although necdin-null fetal liver HSCs increase serial replating capability in methylcellulose and maintain stemness in long-term stromal based cultures better than wild type HSCs, necdin-null fetal liver HSCs repopulate lethally irradiated recipient mice similar to wild type HSCs, in primary, secondary, and tertiary serial bone marrow transplantation assays. In addition, necdin-null HSCs show almost comparable repopulating ability as wild type HSCs, after secondary competitive bone marrow transplantation assays. These imply that necdin is dispensable for HSC self renewal. On the other hand, BM-derived necdin-null HSCs show decreased quiescence 4 months after transplantation, and increased proliferation as indicated by in vivo BrdU incorporation assays. Furthermore, recipient mice repopulated with necdin-null HSCs show enhanced sensitivity both to weekly 5-FU administration and to total body irradiation, as manifested by increased mortality. This suggests that the decreased quiescence of necdin-null HSCs leads to their depletion under conditions of genotoxic stress. Gene expression profiling studies have identified several deregulated signaling pathways in the necdin-null HSCs. Expression of several p53 target genes is altered in irradiated necdin-null HSCs, which may account for their enhanced radiosensitivity. We are now investigating these necdin target genes to clarify how necdin functions to critically regulate HSC quiescence. We are also determining whether targeting necdin could be a therapeutic approach to eliminate quiescent leukemia stem cells, using a murine CML model.
