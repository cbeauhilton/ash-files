    "abstract_text": "We analyzed expression of the transcription factor Ikaros in human hematologic malignancies and found overexpression of the short isoform of Ikaros, Ik-6, in patients with blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia and pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We have made several stable transfectants which overexpress Ik-6 and analyzed the consequence of Ik-6 overexpression. First, overexpression of Ik-6 in FDH-1, which was established from a patient with early pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and Ramos conferred resistance to dexamethasone- and anti-IgM-induced apoptosis, respectively. Upon treatment with dexamethasone, FDH-1 cells demonstrated massive apoptosis measured by staining with Annexin V. In contrast to mock transfectants, Ik-6 transfectants showed less marked apoptosis (mock 86.4% vs Ik-6 34.4\u201373.6%, p=0.01). We also used Ramos as a model of anti-IgM-induced apoptosis, and flow cytometric analysis was performed with Annexin-V staining. In contrast to mock transfectants, Ik-6 transfectants showed less pronounced apoptosis (mock 40.4% vs Ik-6 23.1\u201327.4%, p=0.03). Next, overexpression of Ik-6 in Nalm6 lead to impaired cell growth and cell cycle progression. Cell growth and cell cycle were analyzed and compared with mock transfectants and Ik-6 transfectants using MTT assay and DNA content analysis with PI staining, respectively. MTT assay demonstrated that, after three days of growth, Ik-6 transfectants grew more slowly than mock transfectants (Ik-6/mock ratio 0.62\u20130.67; p=0.01). DNA content analysis showed that, after three days of growth, more Ik-6 transfectants underwent G0\u2013G1 arrest than mock transfectants (Ik-6/mock ratio 1.15\u20131.21; p=0.01), and less Ik-6 transfectants entered into S phase than mock transfectants (Ik-6/mock ratio 0.84\u20130.90; p=0.05). Finally, overexpression of Ik-6 promoted all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced granulocytic differentiation, and, on the other hand, inhibited vitamin D3 (VD3)-induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60. Upon induction of granulocytic differentiation by ATRA, mock transfectants showed 74.5% positivity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) staining. In contrast, Ik-6 transfectants showed 51.5\u201356.8% of positivity of MPO staining (p=0.04). NBT reduction assay demonstrated 43.8% positivity with mock transfectants and 62.3\u201367.3% positivity with Ik-6 transfectants (p=0.001). Upon induction of monocytic differentiation by VD3, mock transfectants showed 51.0% positivity of nonspecific esterase (NSE) staining. In contrast, Ik-6 transfectants showed 26.8\u201336.0% of positivity of NSE staining (p=0.03). To understand the underlying mechanisms, we report the results of microarray analysis of Ik-6 transfectants.",
