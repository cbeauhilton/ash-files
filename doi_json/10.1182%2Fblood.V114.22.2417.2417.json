    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2417 Poster Board II-394 Heparin is one of the widely used anticoagulants for the prophylaxis and treatment of thrombotic disorders. Heparin, a linear polysaccharide belonging to a family of glycosaminoglycans (GAGS) consists of repeating disaccharide units of 1-4 linked iduronic acid and glucosamine residues. Heparin is a mixture of low, medium and high molecular fractions and is heterogeneous not only in terms of molecular weight but also sites and degree of sulfation. Oversulfated chondroitin sulfate, one of the important toxic contaminants in certain batches of heparins manufactured during 2007 to 2008 resulted in deaths of some patients following intravenous administration that led to the recall of these heparins by the FDA. An increased incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and thrombosis syndrome (HITTS) was reported as a result of contaminated heparins. It was hypothesized that OSCS interacts with heparins and other LMWHs increasing their HIT/HITTS potential. In order to validate this hypothesis blood was drawn from healthy volunteers (n=5) and mixed with 3.2% sodium citrate solution (9 parts of whole blood to 1 part of citrate). The citrated blood samples were centrifuged at 800 rpm to obtain platelet rich plasma (PRP) and further centrifuged at 3000 rpm to obtain platelet poor plasma (PPP). Apheresis fluid was collected from confirmed cases of HIT and pooled. The platelet aggregometers (Biodata) were blanked with individual PPP. The PRP (300ml) was mixed with HIT positive pooled apheresis fluid (200ml) and platelet aggregation was recorded using Gentium Heparin, Enoxaparin, and Bemiparin at a final concentration of 10mg/ml, either alone or in mixtures of 10%, 20% and 30% OSCS. The Heparin-induced platelet aggregations (HIPA) were run for a period of 30 minutes and the tracings obtained. While OSCS alone at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml caused an average of 29.5% platelet aggregation, it did not cause an augmentation of platelet aggregation in 10%, 20% and 30% mixtures with Heparin, Enoxaparin, Bemiparin and AVE 5026 (see table ). This data suggests that drugs like heparin, and low molecular weight heparins such as Enoxaparin, and Bemiparin did not augment HIT/HITTS response when combined in various proportions with OSCS. Based on HIPA the reported increase in HIT response may therefore be due to in vivo interactions of the OSCS with platelets and endothelial cells. Corroborative evidence from clinical studies are warranted to validate these preliminary results.  Drugs (FC10mg/ml) . Drug Alone . 10%OSCS mixture . 20%OSCS mixture . 30%OSCS mixture . OSCS alone .
