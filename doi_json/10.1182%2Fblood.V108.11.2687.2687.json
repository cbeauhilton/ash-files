    "abstract_text": "Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare clonal myeloproliferative disorder that affects young children. It is characterized by specific hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in vitro . Mutations in RAS , NF1, or PTPN11 positioned in the GM-CSF signal transduction pathway, which contribute to myeloid proliferation, have been recognized in the pathogenesis of JMML. Recently a multi-step model for leukemogenesis has been proposed. In this model, the pathogenesis of leukemia requires at least two classes of mutations: primary mutations of genes implicated in cell differentiation such as AML1 and PU.1 and additional mutations of genes contributing to myeloid proliferation such as FLT3 , RAS, and PTPN11 . We hypothesized that in patients with JMML, in addition to known mutations of genes in the GM-CSF pathway involved in myeloid proliferation, potential causative mutations of other classes might be acquired. AML1 encodes a transcription factor that is essential for definitive hematopoiesis, and its mutations have recently been found in adults with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. However, no information is available on the profiles of mutations in these genes and the relationship between these mutations and clinical features of JMML in children. We analyzed mutations of N-RAS , K-RAS, and PTPN11 in 50, and of AML1 in 30 Japanese children with JMML by direct sequencing. Correlation between the mutational status and clinical and laboratory findings, including age at diagnosis, sex, fetal hemoglobin (HbF), platelets count, cytogenetic abnormalities, and hepatomegaly, all which are suggested prognostic factors for JMML, were also assessed. Of the 50 patients with JMML, cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 14, including 8 with monosomy 7. PTPN11 and N-/K-RAS mutations were found in 24 (48%) and 7 (14%) patients, respectively, and a novel mutation in AML1 was identified in one patient. No simultaneous mutations in these genes were found. Age at diagnosis was older (median 36 vs 11 months, p=0.0005) and HbF level was higher (31.0% vs 5.1%, p=0.033) in patients with the PTPN11 mutation than those with the RAS mutation. No difference was observed between patients with PTPN11 and RAS mutations in sex ratio, white blood cell count, platelets count, and the incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities and hepatomegaly. Our results suggest that the clinical outcome of patients with PTPN11 might differ from those with RAS mutations because a higher level of HbF and older age have been reported to be poor prognostic factors. In one patient with JMML, we identified a novel mutation in the AML1 gene that belongs to the class of genes contributing to cell differentiation instead of the class of genes in the GM-CSF pathway involved in myeloid proliferation.",
