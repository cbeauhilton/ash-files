    "abstract_text": "Innate immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial rule in antitumor immune responses. NK cells have functionally opposite receptors for activating and inhibiting signals to exert cytotoxicity. NKG2D is a C-type lectin-like activating receptor and is expressed in various immune cells, including NK cells, NKT cells, CD8 + \u03b1/\u03b2 + T cells, and \u03b3/\u03b4 + T cells. NKG2D recognizes its ligands, MHC class I-related chain A and B (MICA, MICB). NKG2D ligands are not present on normal cells but are induced by various stresses such as viral infection. Moreover NKG2D ligands are expressed in many malignant cells including hematological malignancies. It has been suggested that involvement of NKG2D in NK or CD8 + Tcell-mediated cytotoxicity correlates with the expression levels of ligands on target cells. Therefore induction of NKG2D ligands may lead to enhance the sensitivity to NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity. In this study, we could enhance expression levels of MICA and MICB by treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TsA) in lymphoid leukemic cell line BALL1 and some primary patients\u2019 lymphoid leukemic cells. Treatment of BALL1 and patients\u2019 leukemic cells with TsA for 12 hr increased MICA and MICB mRNA expression at least by more than 2 fold by Real-time PCR. Treatment of BALL1 with TsA for 12 hr increased MICA and MICB protein expression on the cell surface by more than 2 fold by flow cytometry analysis. These results suggested that expression of MICA and MICB is partly regulated by histone acetylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that treatment with TsA resulted in increased acetylation of histone H3 and decreased association with the counteracting enzymes of histone acetyltransferases HDAC1 at the MICA and MICB promoter in BALL1 cell and patients\u2019 leukemic cells. To examine the impact of the cytolytic activity of NKG2D-expressing cells on leukemic cells in which expression of NKG2D ligands was induced by TsA treatment, we performed standard 4 hr 51 Cr release assays using BALL1 cells and patients\u2019 leukemic cells. Up-regulation of NKG2D ligands by TsA treatment led to enhance the susceptibility of BALL1 and patients\u2019 leukemic cells by 2 or 3 times to the cytolytic activity of NKG2D-expressing cells. Blocking experiment using specific antibodies for MICA and MICB inhibited the NKG2D-expressing cell-mediated cytolytic activity against BALL1 cells. Our results suggest that regulation of NKG2D ligands expression by treatment with chromatin-remodeling drugs may be an effective strategy to enhance the susceptibility of leukemic cells to the cytolytic activity of NKG2D-expressing cells for immunotherapy.",
