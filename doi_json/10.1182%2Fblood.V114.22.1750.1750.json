    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1750 Poster Board I-776 Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal disorder sharing features of both myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). The natural course of CMML is highly variable. Several small series have suggested the prognostic importance of different characteristics but a widely accepted prognostic scoring system for CMML is not available. The main aims of the study were to identify prognostic factors, including cytogenetic findings, for overall survival (OS) and acute leukemic (AL) transformation in a large series of patients with CMML and to develop an easily applicable prognostic scoring index for estimating outcome and planning treatment in the individual patient. Five hundred and seventy-two patients diagnosed of CMML according to FAB and WHO criteria in 25 centers belonging to the Spanish Registry of MDS were included in the study. Actuarial curves of OS and risk of AL evolution were built by Kaplan-Meier method and differences between curves compared with log-rank tests. Multivariate analyses of OS and risk of AL evolution were performed by Cox proportional hazards regression method. The weights assigned to the variables included in the final prognostic scoring system were based on the regression coefficients from the proportional hazards models. Median age was 73 yr and 397 (69%) were males. According to FAB criteria 61% of the patients had MDS-CMML (absolute WBC count '13 \u00d7 10 9 /L) and 39% MPD-CMML and by WHO classification 86% were CMML-1 (blasts 480 U/L (P3 \u00d7 10 9 /L (P<0.001), platelets '100 \u00d7 10 9 /L (P=0.001), serum ferritin level >500 ng/mL (P480 U/L, 1 point) and cytogenetic risk group (high-risk, 1 point) was developed (overall risk, 0 \u2013 5.5 points). This scoring system was able to stratify patients into 4 risk groups (low, 0 points; intermediate-1, 1\u20131.5 points; intermediate-2, 2 points; and high, 2.5 \u2013 5.5 points) with significantly different probabilities of death (median OS, 105, 38, 22, and 11 mo, respectively; P<0.001; Figure ) and AL evolution (cumulative risk at 5 yr, 3%, 24%, 33%, and 40%, respectively; P=0.001). The results of this study confirm the prognostic impact of FAB and WHO subtypes and serum LDH level and recognize for the first time the relevance of RBC transfusion dependency and specific chromosomal abnormalities in CMML. Finally, they offer a simple and powerful index for assessing prognosis and planning therapy in CMML. Figure View large Download slide Overall survival curve according to the CMML Score System.
