    "abstract_text": "Background and aim: Inflammasome and pyroptosis overactivation have recently been associated as fundamental mechanisms in the ineffective hematopoiesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) shares histological and clinical characteristics with MDS but, within clinical differences, It stands out a high association with inflammatory/autoimmune diseases in which a disproportionate activation of inflamasome has been implicated. Our hypothesis is that CMML cases show a higher inflammasome activation with respect to the MDS subset, a relevant difference both in terms of potential therapeutic targets and pathogenic clues. The main objective is to confirm, describe and quantify these differences using high-performance and multi-gene/protein methods. Methods: We performed enhanced RNA-seq in bone marrow mononucleated cells of 27 CMML at diagnosis, 10 MDS and 9 controls (103 million average readings). We selected 116 genes related to the inflammasome and reviewed the differential expression between cases and controls. We evaluated by multiplex immunoassay the profile of 28 cytokines in peripheral blood in 35 CMML patients, 37 MDS and 8 controls. Subsequently, we studied whether these differentially expressed genes / cytokines showed differences in CMML depending on the mutational state of TET2, SRSF2 and ASXL1 . Finally, we compared in vitro the degree of activation of inflamasome in the monocytoid component of 8 CMML patients versus 7 controls. Results: In the transcriptomic analysis of the inflamasome genes in patients with CMML, we found 30 of 116 differentially expressed genes compared with healthy controls. Of those 30 genes, 26 showed a pro-inflammatory function and, of them, 18 were up-regulated. Of the 4 differentially expressed genes with an anti-inflammatory function, 3 were significantly under-expressed in CMML patients. We highlight, due to the quantitative difference, the overexpression of two genes coding for monocyte chemotactic proteins, CCL7 and CCL2 (FC = 269.21, p = 0.032; FC = 11.79, p = 0.03) That pro-inflammatory transcriptional profile was not so evident in the cases of MDS: of the 29 differentially expressed genes with pro-inflammatory function, 18 were down-regulated. Subsequently, we designed a customized panel for proteomic analysis including 9 of the 30 differentially expressed genes in CMML. We found that, in a relevant percentage of cases, also proinflammatory cytokines derived from these differentially expressed genes were elevated (62.5%) in peripheral blood of patients, compared to healthy donors; pointing towards the key role of gene transcription in the definition of the pro-inflammatory sense of the proteomic dimension of inflammasome in CMML. Next, we found that those patients with CMML and somatic mutations of TET2 had a higher expression of CCL7 and CCL2 compared to patients with CMML wild type, with a tendency to significance in the first case and significant in the second (FC 11.9, p = 0.15; FC 7.8, p = 0.03). Finally, we conducted in vitro stimulation studies at diagnosis in patients with CMML confirming that the canonical activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (increased production of IL-1\u03b2) is significantly enhanced with respect to control individuals. Conclusion: We describe for the first time, a hyperactivation in CMML, compared with MDS, of the components of the inflammasome. Hyperactivation associated in CMML to a gene transcriptional mechanism and related, in the case of the two most over-expressed genes, CCL2 and CCL7 , to the presence of mutations in TET2 . Our findings point to new therapeutic targets whose modulation could restore inefficient hemopoiesis and potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in CMML.
