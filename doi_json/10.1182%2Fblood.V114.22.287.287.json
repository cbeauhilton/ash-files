    "abstract_text": "Abstract 287 Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a lymphoproliferative disorder of mature B-cells with an aggressive course and short survival. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BZM) induces clinical responses in up to 50% of patients. Conversely, in half of the cases the lymphoma cells are intrinsically resistant or rapidly develop resistance to BZM. To investigate the mechanisms of BZM resistance, we generated HBL2 and JEKO bortezomib resistant (HBL2-BR, JEKO-BR) derivative lines by continuous culture in sub-lethal concentrations of BZM. After several months, clones of HBL2-BR and JEKO-BR were obtained showing BZM IC50 at 48h of 41.6 and 44.6 nM, compared to 6 and 4.9 nM for the respective parental lines. Acquired resistance to BZM remained stable over months but gradually decreased with extended passages in the absence of BZM, suggesting adaptive changes rather than a single gene mutation as the basis of BZM resistance. BR cells exhibited higher proteasome activity, which was dose-dependently inhibited by higher concentrations of BZM. However, BR cells were able to survive with lower proteasome activity than the parental cells, indicating that BR cells had acquired additional changes. To investigate these changes, we use gene expression profiling (GEP) on Affymetrix U133A plus 2 arrays to compared HBL2-BR (in triplicate) and JEKO-BR (in duplicate) subclones to the corresponding parental lines. Unexpectedly, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of microarray data revealed reduced expression of the mature B-cell gene signature (including genes for CD19, BLNK, SPIB, SYK) and increased expression of plasma cell differentiation signatures (including genes for CD38, IRF4, BLIMP, CD138) in both HBL-2 BR and JEKO-BR. BR lines also expressed higher protein levels of the master plasma cell regulators BLIMP and IRF4, but did not show enhanced expression of the secretory program controlled by XBP1. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that BR cells had dramatically reduced expression of B-cell surface markers, including CD19, CD24 and CD52, and expressed plasma cell markers, such as CD38 and CD138. Consistent with a partial plasmacytoid phenotype, BR cells tended to be somewhat larger and more granular than parental cells. Loss of BZM resistance over months of culture in the absence of BZM was paralleled by the recovery of CD19 and CD24 expression and down-regulation of CD38, supporting a mechanistic link between the acquisition of a plasmacytoid phenotype and BZM resistance. We have previously shown that the MCL cell lines Mino and REC-1 are less sensitive to BZM than HBL-2, JEKO and most other MCL cell lines. Here we found that these constitutively resistant cells also showed plasmacytoid features including CD38 and CD138 surface expression, increased granularity and size, and an enlarged endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Combined these changes may enhance the ability of the cells to deal with an increased protein load due to bortezomib inhibition. In addition, we also observed higher expression of IRF4 and its target genes in the constitutively resistant cells, as well as higher IRF4 and CD38 expression in primary tumor cells of patients with poor response to BZM. Given the important role of IRF4 as a survival factor in multiple myeloma, we tested whether BZM treatment could decrease IRF4 expression in MCL cells. Indeed, within 24 hours BZM dose-dependently decreased IRF4 expression and the degree of downregulation of IRF4 correlated with the induction of apoptosis. Knockdown of IRF4 expression by shRNA has been shown to be toxic to myeloma cells (Shaffer et al, Nature 2008). Surprisingly, we found a similar toxic effect of IRF4 knockdown using the same inducible shRNA system in the MCL cell lines HBL2, JEKO and REC, which was more prominent in the latter BZM resistant cell line. These results identify loss of IRF4 expression as an additional mechanism by which BZM may induce cell death. However, overexpression of IRF4 in MCL cells is not sufficient to induce bortezomib resistance, indicating that several components of the plasma cell program cooperate to protect cells from BZM induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we have identified markers of BZM resistance that may be clinically relevant predictors of outcome. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
