    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by chronic pain and bouts of extreme acute pain from vasoocclusive crises (VOC). Sickle pain has both neuropathic and inflammatory features ( Tran et al., Blood 2017 ). Mechanisms underlying neural injury remain unknown in SCD. Neurite outgrowth inhibitor (NOGO-A/reticulon-4) and its receptor NGR1 contribute to pain, neuronal damage, and inhibition of neurite outgrowth ( Hu et al., FASEB J 2019 ). We examined if NOGO-A pathway is activated in a sickle microenvironment and if its inhibition will ameliorate hyperalgesia in BERK sickle mice. We used Rho kinase activity (ROCK) downstream of NGR1 as a readout of activation of NOGO-A/NGR1 pathway. We observed increased expression of NOGO-A (~260%, p<0.05) and NGR1 (~180%, p<0.05) in the dorsal root ganglia, and increased NOGO-A and ROCK activity in spinal cords of sickle mice compared to control mice expressing normal human hemoglobin A. Earlier, we found that an endogenous cannabinoid, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) inhibits spinal NOGO-A expression and ROCK activity in sickle mice (Argueta et al., ASH 2020 #225). We hypothesized that sickle microenvironment with cell-free heme and inflammation activates NOGO-A/NGR1-ROCK pathway leading to nerve injury and pain, and inhibition of this pathway will ameliorate hyperalgesia in sickle mice. Using terminally differentiated rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, we simulated a sickle microenvironment with hemin (40 \u00b5M) and TNF\u03b1 (1 ng/ml) (H+T). H+T elevated ROCK activity compared to vehicle (~40%, p<0.05). PEA (30 uM) and 2 \u00b5M NEP (1-40), a competitive antagonist of NGR1, attenuated H+T-induced ROCK activity (both p<0.01); co-treatment had no additive effect, indicating a common pathway. As well, siRNA (10 nM) knockdown of NGR1 reversed H+T-induced ROCK activity (p<0.001), which was equally effective with 30 \u00b5M PEA co-treatment. Functionally, treatment with 30 \u00b5M PEA or 2 \u00b5M NEP (1-40) enhanced neurite outgrowth in H+T-treated PC-12 cells (~120%, p<0.001). NEP (1-40) at 5 mg/kg reduced mechanical and cold (both ~50%, p<0.001) hyperalgesia in sickle mice compared to baseline (BL) and/or vehicle treatment. Together, these data demonstrate that NOGO-A/NGR1 pathway activation may underlie nerve injury, and inhibition of this pathway with a NGR1 antagonist or PEA promotes neurite outgrowth and reduces hyperalgesia in a sickle microenvironment. We next examined the contribution of exogenously administered and endogenously produced PEA in ameliorating hyperalgesia. Mass spectrometry revealed that spinal PEA is reduced in female (p<0.05) and male (p<0.001) sickle mice compared to age/sex-matched control mice. Exogenous PEA (i.p. 20 mg/kg/d) reduced cold avoidance over a 3-day treatment period, showing significantly more time in the cold chamber compared to BL or vehicle at 1 h, 24 h, and 72 h (p<0.05). The analgesic effect of PEA was maintained for 9 days of treatment without developing tolerance. We next increased endogenous PEA by inhibiting its degradative enzyme, N-acylethanolamine acid amidase, with ARN19702 (i.p. 3, 10, & 30 mg/kg/d), which reduced mechanical (~50%, p<0.001) and cold hyperalgesia (~40%, p<0.001) over 72 hours in a dose-dependent manner. Since hypoxia and ischemia reperfusion injury contribute to acute VOC pain, we incited hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR; 3 h @ 8% O 2 , 92% N 2 , followed by 1 h @ normoxia) to simulate acute VOC pain. We observed that 5-day pretreatment with PEA (i.p. 20 mg/kg/d) before HR prevented mechanical and cold hyperalgesia following HR in sickle mice. Moreover, treatment with PEA after HR incitement significantly reduced hyperalgesia for 24 h after HR compared to BL (~30%, p<0.001) and vehicle treated (~66%, p<0.001) sickle mice. NGR1 antagonism reduces spinal microglial injury/activation. Heme and TNF\u03b1 have been shown to cause microglial injury in vitro , while spinal microglial activation has been demonstrated in sickle mice (Lei et al., Antioxid Redox Signal 2021). Thus, NGR1/ROCK cascade may contribute to both neuronal injury and inflammation in the central nervous system leading to neuropathic pain. Our data suggest that PEA and targeting NOGO-A pathway may prevent/reduce chronic and acute hyperalgesia in sickle mice. We speculate that interventions targeting NOGO-A pathway may prevent/reduce neuropathic pain and that PEA has the translational potential for the treatment of chronic and acute pain in SCD.
