    "abstract_text": "Preclinical Rationale: Myelofibrosis (MF) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm for which there are limited therapies. TGF\u03b2 plays a pivotal role in the pathobiology of MF by not only promoting bone marrow fibrosis (BMF) and collagen deposition, but also by enhancing the dormancy of normal but not MF hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). TGF\u03b2 has also previously been reported to inhibit normal megakaryocyte (MK) production (Bruno et al Blood 1998). TGF\u03b21 promotes the synthesis of collagen by normal human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and activates the TGF\u03b2 receptor I/SMAD pathway as well as non-canonical TGF\u03b2 pathways. We generated MKs from MF subject mononuclear cells (MNCs) and showed that they elaborated significantly greater levels of TGF\u03b21 than TGF\u03b22/3 TGF\u03b21 treatment reduced the numbers of hematopoietic colonies generated by normal but not MF MNCs. Treatment of MSCs with AVID200, a potent TGF\u03b21/3 protein trap, significantly decreased MSC proliferation, phosphorylation of SMAD2, and collagen expression. Robust expression of pSMAD2 was observed in the absence of exogenous TGF\u03b2 in normal donor or MF-MKs, Addition of AVID200 to -MKs decreased pSMAD2 without affecting total SMAD2/3, indicating that AVID200 blocks the effects of autocrine TGF\u03b2 produced by MKs and led to increased numbers of MKs. Moreover, treatment of primary MF MNCs with AVID200 led to increased numbers of progenitor cells with wild type JAK2 and a reduction of mutated colonies. AVID200 blocked TGF\u03b21-induced p57Kip2 expression and SMAD2 activation by MF MNCs allowing the normal progenitor cells to preferentially cycle, proliferate, and form hematopoietic colonies. Clinical Trial Design: Based on these findings, a phase 1 trial of AVID200 is ongoing in INT-2/high risk MF subjects resistant or intolerant to ruxolitinib; baseline platelet count of \u2265 25 x 109/L, and grade 2/3 BMF. Subjects received intravenous AVID200 (Lots A and B) in dose cohorts of 180 mg/m2 (A), 550 mg/m2 (A), 180 mg/m2 (B) on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle. Cohorts of 3 subjects with a target toxicity rate of 30% were enrolled to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). A modified toxicity probability interval design was used. Response was assessed by IWG/ELN criteria after 6 cycles of AVID200. Subjects attaining at least a CI or SD with a decrease in BMF by \u22651 grade, continued AVID200. Clinical Trial Results: 10 subjects were enrolled (1 withdrew before receiving treatment) and 9 were treated with AVID200 and were evaluable for DLT assessment [Table1]. Median time after ruxolitinib discontinuation was 3.5 months (0.5-12.2). No DLTs were observed. Grade 3/4 AEs (regardless of attribution) were observed in 6 (66.7%) subjects. Grade 3/4 non-hematologic AEs observed were epistaxis (1, 11.1%), extraocular muscle paresis (1, 11.1%), fatigue (1, 11.1%) and rash (1, 11.1%). Grade 3/4 hematologic AEs were anemia (3, 33.3%) and thrombocytopenia (2, 22.2%) [Table 2]. The median number of cycles received was 5.7 (range 0 - 12). 5 subjects received 6+ cycles and were evaluable. CI occurred in 2 subjects [anemia, spleen and TSS (n=1); TSS (n=1)] 1 of which is still being treated, 2 subjects had SD, 1 subject with 21% blasts prior to study treatment had progressive MPN-BP. 4 subjects failed to reach response evaluation after 6 cycles, 2 had PD due to increasing splenomegaly, 1 subject received an allogeneic transplant and 1 is still being treated [Cycle 2]. The median platelet count at baseline was 114 (range: 42-290) and 159 after cycle 6 [Figure 1]. Maximum changes in platelets from baseline was +64% [range -73%, 169%] in all subjects. 7 subjects had an increase in platelets from baseline during treatment. 2 subjects normalized their platelet count from thrombocytopenic levels. The effect of AVID200 on BMF is currently being examined. 2 subjects remain on treatment. Conclusions: AVID200 a TGF\u03b21/3 protein trap is well tolerated in advanced MF subjects. Clinical responses were observed at the 550 mg dose and the expansion efficacy cohorts at doses 2 and 3 are enrolling 12 additional subjects. Furthermore, AVID200 therapy improved thrombocytopenia in MF subjects which may be due to AVID200 inhibiting the effects of TGF\u03b21 on normal MKpoiesis. Updated subject safety and efficacy data along with correlative data will be presented.
