    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease (cGVHD) is a leading cause of late non-relapse mortality (NRM) and morbidity after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT).Though the incidence of cGVHD is reported to be lower after umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT), studies describing its clinical presentation, response to treatment, duration of immune suppression (IST) and NRM following diagnosis of cGVHD are limited. We hence performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who developed cGVHD following a UCBT and compared to matched sibling donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant (MSD PBSCT) treated uniformly in a similar manner at a single center. Methods: This single center retrospective cohort study included all adult patients who underwent an allogeneic HCT at University of Minnesota between the years 2010 and 2017 from an MSD PBSCT or double/single UCBT and developed cGVHD (n=145). The 2014 NIH Consensus Criteria ( Jagasia et al. Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 21 (2015) 389-401 ) were used to retrospectively classify organ/overall cGVHD severity, and response ( Lee at al. Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 21 (2015) 984-999 ) to IST. Results: Of 145 patients, 104 (72%) received MSD PBSCT and 41 (28%) UCBT. The median age (range) at HCT was 54y (23-74y) vs. 50y (19-69y) in MSD PBSCT and UCBT, respectively. The median time from HCT to cGVHD was similar at 216 days in MSD PBSCT vs. 224 days in UCBT. cGVHD onset was progressive in 22% of MSD PBSCT vs. 29% of UCBT. Overlap cGVHD was similar at 32% in MSD PBSCT vs. 37% in UCBT respectively (p=0.58). Thrombocytopenia (platelet count  3 organs with cGVHD was more frequent in MSD PBSCT (Figure 1). Amongst organ involvement, liver was significantly more frequently involved in MSD PBSCT, whereas GI involvement was significantly more frequent in UCBT (both p<0.01; Figure 2). No difference was seen in response (complete or partial: CR or PR) at 6 months (78% vs. 78%, p=0.98), 1 year (80% vs. 78%, p=0.78) or 2 years (67% vs. 67%, p=0.99) between MSD PBSCT or UCBT. In multivariate analysis of response at one year using NIH criteria, UCBT recipients had similar odds of a CR or PR (OR: 0.9 (95% CI: 0.4-2.1, p = 0.9). Karnofsky performance score (KPS) of > 90 at diagnosis of cGVHD was associated with 3-fold higher odds of response (95% CI: 1.42-10.0, p <0.01). The overall cumulative incidence of 2-year NRM following cGVHD diagnosis was 15% (95% CI: 9-21%). The 2-year cumulative incidence of NRM following MSD was 13% (95% CI: 7-20%), vs. 20% in UCBT (95% CI: 8-33%). In multivariate analysis UCBT recipients had a similar risk of NRM at 2 years as compared to MSD recipients (RR: 1.9, 95% CI: 0.8-4.3, p=0.15). Across both cohorts KPS < 90 was associated with an 8.8-fold higher risk of NRM (95% CI: 3.1-24.9, p < 0.01) and platelet count of < 100,000/\u03bcl was associated with 3-fold higher risk of NRM (95% CI: 1.25-10, p= 0.01). The cumulative incidence of durable discontinuation of all IST (discontinuation of all IST without restarting for at least 6 months) at 2 years was 42% (95% CI: 32-51%). There was no difference noted between MSD (39%, 95% CI: 28-49%) vs. UCBT recipients (50%, 95% CI: 32-69%), p= 0.63 (Figure 4). Conclusions: cGVHD following UCBT differed in presentation from MSD PBSCT. cGVHD following UCBT was less severe and had more frequent GI involvement and less frequent liver involvement as compared to MSD PBSCT. Despite the differences in clinical presentation, cGVHD following UCBT had similar treatment responses and NRM to that following MSD PBSCT. High risk groups including those with platelet count of <100,000/\u03bcl and KPS< 90, need careful monitoring and possibly intensified therapy.
