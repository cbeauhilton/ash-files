Methods: A total 53 patients with hematological malignancies and pulmonary infections, admitted of the Novosibirsk Regional Clinical Hospital were examined. The analysis of serum in first three days was carried out at occurrence of attributes of pulmonary infection (1-st serum) and in dynamics - in 3 weeks from a beginning of an infection (2-nd serum). Definition of antibodies to a virus Koxakie-B3 (strain \u201cNancy\u201d) was made in reaction of neutralization in 3-daily cultures Hep-2. Results took into account after approach of cytopathogenic effect in cultures Hep-2, containing 100 dozes of a virus in control titration. Limiting cultivation of serum, neutralizing of 100 cytopathogenic dozes of a virus, was considered as its titer. Results: At 43 of 53 examined patients on admission or in a debut of an infection (at the patients with the developed infectious complication) the neutralized antibodies to a virus Koxakie-B3 were found out in serum. Thus the titer of antibodies from 1:4 up to 1:8 was revealed at 28 patients, at 14 it has made 1:16 \u2013 1:32 and only at one patient on admission the titer of antibodies to a virus Koxakie B3 was 1:64. The total titer of virusneutrolized antibodies on admission or in a debut of an infection was accordingly 2,03 log2 and 2,84 log2. At research of serum taken after three weeks of stay in hospital of the patients, at which the infection was not developed (after a beginning of an infection at the patients with the developed infectious complication), in both groups the increase of a titer of antibodies in 1,97 and 1,5 times was marked, accordingly, and the total titer of antibodies in log2 has made 4,0 and 4,3. It is necessary to take into account, however, that at an estimation of serologic status at virus infections the absolute parameters of antibodies titers, how many their growth in pair serums matter not so much. Thus, authentic confirmation of the current virus infection is the increase of a titer of antibodies in dynamics in 4 times and more. The essential distinctions between two chosen groups were here again revealed. And, in group with hematological malignancies without infectious complications the four-multiple increase of a antibodies titer was marked only at 4 of 26 patients, and in group with infectious complications the authentic growth of a level of antibodies to a virus Koxakie-B3 was marked more than at half of surveyed patients (15 of 27), OR=6,88; 95%CI=1,61\u201331,87. Conclusions: On the basis of the received results it is possible to conclude, that Koxakie B3 - virus infection is the factor enough frequently accompanying clinical current of pulmonary infections in patients with hematological malignancies.",
