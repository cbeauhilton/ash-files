    "abstract_text": "We report retrospective data concerning 49 relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma pts, treated from 1995 in our institution with high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with autologous peripheral blood stem cell (aPBSC) support. 41/49 had resistant disease, because presenting an early relapse (14/41), a late relapse (12/41) after CR induced by standard chemotherapy (CT) or persistence of disease (15/41) after initial CT. 8/49 had refractory disease, presenting stable or progressive disease within three months after the end of first line CT. Median age at transplantation time of 32 yrs (range 18\u201358 yrs). Before high dose chemotherapy, all pts received at least a standard chemotherapy (hybrid regimen for 4\u20136 cycles \u00b1 RT, according to the extension of disease). At the time of transplantation, 13 pts were in complete remission, 31 were in partial or very good partial remission and 5 were in stable /progressive disease. We used as myeloablative regimen mainly HDBEAM. Radiotherapy was performed in 9 pts after transplantation. In the subgroup of the 26 relapsed pts, 21 achieved a CR, 2 a PR and 3 a PD/SD; with a median follow up of 23 months from transplant (range 2 \u2013 112 months), expected DFS and OS at 10 years are 90.5% and 76.9%, respectively. Analyzing separately early versus late relapsed patients, DFS expected at 10 years are 81.8% and 100%, respectively, and the OS expected are 71.4 and 83%, respectively. 11/15 pts with persistence of disease after initial CT achieved a CR, 2 PR, 2 presented SD/PD; with a median follow-up of 32 months from transplant (range 2 \u2013 88 months), expected DFS and OS are 90.9% and 75%, respectively. Finally, 5/8 refractory pts achieved a CR (two of them progressed after transplant), 2 pts a PR (both progressed and died after transplant), 1 patient obtained a SD (progressed and died after transplant). No toxic deaths or second cancer or other severe late toxicity were recorded. Autologous transplantation is a safe procedure, considering the manageable early and late toxic effect; the clinical results achieved indicate that HDCT with aPBSC support is to be considered the first therapeutic option for those pts who present an early or late relapse after standard chemotherapy. The low number of refractory pts doesn\u2019t allow any definitive conclusion about its role in this subgroup, but the relative high number of events observed seems to suggest that further analysis of biological features are warranted in order to better define the best therapeutic option.",
