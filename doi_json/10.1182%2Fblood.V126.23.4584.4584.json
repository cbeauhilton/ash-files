    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Pain is the top concern of individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). Acute painful vaso-occlusive episodes are the leading cause of emergency department (ED) encounters and frequent hospital admissions. There are well-documented disparities for patients with SCD, including significant delays in starting therapy and under treatment of pain in the ED. An acute care observation unit (ACOU) staffed with SCD specialists can help to address these disparities. Here we study the service impact of increasing the hours of operation of a dedicated sickle cell ACOU on utilization and hospital admissions at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), a regional sickle cell resource. We hypothesized that increased hours of operations will lead to decreased ED utilization and inpatient hospitalizations. Methods: The outcomes of individuals >16 years of age presenting with an acute painful episode to the sickle cell ACOU at UIC were assessed for the 12 months before and the 12 months after increasing the hours of operation from 9 hours/day to 15 hours/day Monday through Friday in February 2014. The outcomes of SCD patients presenting to the ED during the 12-month period following expanding hours in the ACOU were also assessed. The main outcome measures were ACOU and ED utilization and hospital admission rates. Results: There were 344 encounters in the sickle cell ACOU in the 12 months before expansion of service hours compared to 796 in the 12 months after expanding the hours, an increase of 131%. This represents 0.15 patients treated per hour before increasing the hours versus 0.2 per hour after increasing the hours. Seventy-two percent of the patients treated at the sickle cell ACOU were discharged home in the 12 months prior to expanding hours versus 75% after. During the comparative 12-month period following expansion of hours in the ACOU, there were 1074 encounters for SCD acute painful episodes in our ED, representing 0.12 patients treated per hour of operation. Only 35% of SCD patients treated in the ED for an acute painful episode were discharged home. Conclusion: The sickle cell ACOU at UIC more than doubled its patient volume following the expansion of operation from 9 to 15 hours/day during weekdays. Based on the hours of operation, during a comparative 12-month period the sickle cell ACOU treated twice as many SCD patients with an acute painful compared to the ED while discharging rather than hospitalizing twice as often. These observations suggest that allocating resources to a dedicated sickle cell ACOU can decrease ED utilization and subsequent inpatient hospitalizations.
