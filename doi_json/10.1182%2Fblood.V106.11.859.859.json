    "abstract_text": "Although the cytotoxic effect of vitamin K3 (VK3) on human cancer cells has been repeatedly reported, no clear conclusions from either in vitro or in vivo tests have so far been made for VK3 as an anticancer agent due to marked inter-tumor variability of efficacy in response to VK3 treatment. Here, we report that sensitivity of neoplastic cells to VK3-induced killing depends on IKK\u03b1 expression/NF-kB activation in the cells. We tested the sensitivity to VK3 of 14 leukemic cell lines established from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The 14 lines were classified into three groups: IKK\u03b1 +/NF-kB+, IKK\u03b1 +/NF-kB\u2212, IKK\u03b1\u2212/NF-kB\u2212. IKK\u03b1 +/NFkB+ cell lines that are generally resistant to doxorubicin are more sensitive to VK3 induced cell death than are the IKK\u03b1 +/NFkB\u2212 lines that are usually sensitive to doxorubicin. The median of IC 50 values of VK3 and doxorubicin as tested by WST analysis for IKK\u03b1 +/NFkB+ cells were 3.92 mM and 1.58 mM, respectively, compared to IKK\u03b1 +/NFkB\u2212 cells (7.3 mM of VK3 and 0.71 mM of doxorubicin, p <0.01, t-test). Assays by testing activation of caspase and cleavage of death substrate PARP as well as flow cytometry showed that apoptosis was induced in a line with high levels of IKK\u03b1/NF-kB activation at 2 h after VK3 treatment. In contrast, apoptosis was not induced by VK3 even at 48 h post-treatment in two lines that lack IKKa expression and NF-kB activation. To test if IKK\u03b1/NF-kB is a molecular target of VK3 inducing apoptosis in ALL, we examined the expression and activation of IKK\u03b1/NF-kB in VK3-treated cells. VK3 specifically reduced IKK\u03b1 expression and inhibited NF-kB activation, resulting in downregulation of NF-kB-mediated gene expression and apoptosis. These results suggest that inhibition of IKK\u03b1/NF-kB signaling pathway is essential for VK3 to induce cell death, and that VK3, a dietary factor with no cytotoxic effect on normal cells, would be a useful adjuvant in the treatment of ALL and other cancer patients whose neoplastic cells express constitutive NF-kB and are resistant to chemotherapy."
