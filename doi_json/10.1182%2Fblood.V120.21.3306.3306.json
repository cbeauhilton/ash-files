    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3306 Background. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is involved in relevant biological functions such as i) platelet adhesion to the vascular endothelium, through interaction with the platelet membrane glycoprotein 1b-alpha (GpIb\u03b1), ii) transport of factor VIII in the circulation, preventing its proteolytic degradation by protein C and iii) regulation of angiogenesis and megakaryocytopoiesis Under the effect of hydrodynamic stress vWF changes its conformation from a globular to an elongated shape, which allows self-aggregation of vWF multimers and the formation of sticky grid, where blood platelets can adhere under high shear flow. Natural type 2B vW mutants (T2B vWD) are considered to have both an increased affinity for platelet GpIb and accelerated hydrolysis by ADAMTS-13. Methods. In this study, the ability of recombinant WT and R1306W vWF mutant to self associate and bind to platelets was investigated in a flow-chamber system under controlled shear stress ranging from 5 to 60 dyn/cm 2 . The recombinant proteins were produced in HEK-293 cells and purified by affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. The analysis of vWF self-association was performed by atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering spectroscopy. The interaction between immobilized recombinant GpIb and WT and R1306W vWF was studied with Surface Plasmon Resonance spectroscopy (SPR). Results. The SPR measurements showed that WT and mutant R1306W A1-A2-A3 domains bind to platelet GpIb with comparable affinity (K d \u2248 20 nM). Full length WT vWF does not significantly interact with GpIb under static conditions, whereas the R1306W mutant showed a significant binding to GpIb. The process of vWF self-association evolved differently as a function of shear stress, whereby at values <10dyn/cm 2 the R1306W mutant, at variance with WT vWF, already showed an initial self-aggregation with formation of a network characterized by a roughness significantly higher than that of WT vWF. Mechanical stretching experiments, performed using the AFM cantilever, showed that R1306W vWF needs 30% less energy per length unit to be stretcted compared to WT protein (1.6 vs 2.2\u00d710 \u221211 J/m) Conclusions. These findings showed that R1306W vWF does not have an increased intrinsic affinity for GpIb. Instead, its increased avidity for platelet receptors arises from an increased sensitivity to hydrodynamic stress, which more easily exposes the binding sites for GpIb.
