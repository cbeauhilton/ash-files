    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4442 Background: Clinical trials for therapeutic angiogenesis use blood- or marrow-derived transplants containing hematopoietic cells, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPCs) to support vascular regeneration. Recently concerns have emerged, as bone marrow-derived stem cell preparations also include these three cell types which probably may contribute to atherosclerosis. We therefore asked whether human myelomonocytic hematopoietic cells, EPCs or MSPCs after pro-angiogenic induction can accumulate lipid droplets (LDs) and develop into foam cells. Method: LD accumulation was quantified by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and cholesterol measurement in each of the tested cell types. The impact of an initial three-day pro-angiogenic culture on subsequent foam cell formation was studied to mimic a relevant setting already being used in clinical trials. The phosphorylation state of intracellular signaling molecules in response to pro-angiogenic stimulation was determined to delineate the operative mechanisms and to establish a basis for interventional strategies. Result: Foam cells were formed by monocytes but neither by EPCs nor by MSPCs after pro-angiogenic induction. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 phosphorylation was enhanced in monocytes after pro-angiogenic stimulation. Kinase inhibition almost abrogated intracellular LD accumulation. Conclusion: These data suggest that hematopoietic cell preparations containing monocytes bear the risk of foam cell formation after pro-angiogenic induction. EPCs and MSPCs instead may drive vascular regeneration without atherogenesis aggravation. A thorough understanding of cell biology is necessary to develop new strategies combining pro-angiogenic and anti-atherogenic cellular effects during therapeutic angiogenesis.
