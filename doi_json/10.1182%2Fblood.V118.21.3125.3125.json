    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3125 Background: We have previously demonstrated that the genetic induction of a conditional suicidal phenotype in donor T cells allows for an operational dissociation of the GVL effect from GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Unfortunately, leukemia often escapes the immunological pressure of alloreactive donor T cells by losing \u201cpassenger\u201d mismatched HLAs. Conversely, redirecting T cells against a non HLA-restricted antigen critically involved in the neoplastic phenotype may circumvent tumor escape due to the emergence of antigen-loss variants. The isoform variant 6 of CD44 is expressed by different epithelial and hematological cancers, and is possibly involved in tumor-cell survival and proliferation. Clinical experience with chemo-conjugated CD44v6-specific mAbs in epithelial tumors showed substantial efficacy, which was however limited by skin toxicity due to background expression of CD44v6 on keratinocytes Aim: By analogy with our experience in HSCT, we reasoned that CD44v6 targeting with suicide gene-modified T cells would provide a major therapeutic effect against hematological tumors, while granting a safety switch in case of toxicity. To this aim, we designed a novel CD44v6-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and developed a strategy for its co-expression with a suicide gene Results: CD44v6 expression by FACS was observed at high levels in 6/17 (37%) cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but did not associate with enhanced leukemia initiation after infusion into NSG mice (83% vs 88%). In all cases, however, AML cells isolated from the bone marrow (BM) of engrafting mice were brightly positive for CD44v6, suggesting in vivo regulation by microenvironmental factors. In vitro, co-culturing primary AML cells with human BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) caused a selective up-regulation of CD44v6 (P90% elimination: 18 hrs vs 112 hrs average, P<0.005) Conclusions: We demonstrated that LV-mediated dual transgenesis of primary human T cells with a novel CD44v6-specific CAR and a suicide gene is feasible, results into a powerful antitumor effect against chemoresistant AML and MM cells, and enables effective T-cell ablation in case of toxicity. The premise that suicide gene-modified CAR-redirected T cells can widen the therapeutic index of CD44v6 targeting awaits clinical confirmation Disclosures: Bordignon: Molmed SpA: Employment.
