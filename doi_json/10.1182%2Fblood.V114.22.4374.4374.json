    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4374 Introduction p53 plays a key role in determining the clinical features of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Disruption of p53 by point mutations, deletion at 17p13, or both, occurs in a fraction of cases at diagnosis and predicts poor survival and chemorefractoriness. In cells with functional p53, p53 activity is inhibited through interaction with MDM2. In fact, p53 can be activated upon exposure of cells to inhibitors of p53/MDM2 interaction, like Nutlins. Exposure of CLL cells to Nutlin-3 is effective in raising the levels of p53 protein with subsequent induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, independently of the most relevant prognostic markers. The aim of the present study was to analyze the gene expression profile (GEP) induced by Nutlin-3 exposure in primary CLL cells from p53 wt and p53 del/mut cases. Patients and methods purified cells from 24 PB CLL samples, all characterized for IGHV mutational status, CD38 and ZAP-70 and p53 mutations (16 p53 wt CLL, 8 p53 del/mut CLL of which 6 with del17p13 and p53 mutations, 1 with del17p13 alone, and 1 with p53 mutations alone), were exposed to 10 mM Nutlin-3 for 24 hours. GEP was performed using a dual labelling strategy; the differential expression of the below reported genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Results i) signature of Nutlin-3 exposure in p53 wt CLL: 144 differentially expressed genes (143 up-regulated, 1 down-regulated) were correlated with response to Nutlin-3. Among the over-expressed genes, several genes were related to apoptosis (e.g. BAX , BBC3 , E124 , IKIP , FAS, LRDD, FLJ11259 , TRIAP1, GADD45, TP53INP1, ISG20L1 , ZMAT3 , TNFRS10C , TNFRSF10B/TRAIL- R2), while other genes (e.g. MDM2, CDKN1A, PCNA ) were up-regulated by Nutlin-3 as a part of a negative feed-back mechanism. Of note, this signature was not shared by 3/16 p53 wt cases (identified as \u201cnon-responder\u201d p53 wt CLL) and 7/8 p53 del/mut cases (identified as \u201cnon-responder\u201d p53 del/mut CLL); consistently, cells from these cases were also significantly resistant to the in-vitro cytotoxic effects of Nutlin-3; ii) signature of Nutlin-3 \u201cnon-responder\u201d p53 wt CLL: by comparing the constitutive GEP of 13 \u201cresponder\u201d versus 3 \u201cnon-responder\u201d p53 wt CLL, we obtained 278 differentially expressed genes, 149 up-regulated and 129 down-regulated in \u201cnon-responder\u201d p53 wt CLL. Among up-regulated genes, we focused on MDM4/MDMX, a gene whose product was known to have an inhibitor activity of p53-dependent transcription and to form Nutlin-3 resistant complexes with p53. Among down-regulated genes, validations were made for BIRC4BP , whose product is known to act as an antagonist of the anti-apoptotic protein XIAP; iii) signature of Nutlin-3 \u201cnon-responder\u201d p53 del/mut CLL: by comparing the constitutive GEP of 13 \u201cresponder\u201d versus 7 \u201cnon-responder\u201d p53 del/mut cases, we obtained 72 differentially expressed genes, 26 up-regulated and 46 down-regulated (31/46 located at the 17p segment) in \u201cnon-responder\u201d p53 del/mut CLL. Validations were made for several genes whose products display pro-apoptotic activities (e.g. PSMB6 , RPL26 and ZBTB4 , located at 17p segment, and GNAZ located at chromosome 22) among down-regulated genes, and ARHGDIA , whose gene product displays anti-apoptotic activities and mediates cellular resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, among up-regulated genes. Notably, CLL cells (n=43) displayed constitutively higher levels of MDM4/MDMX (p<0.0001) and ARHGDIA (p=0.0002) transcripts than purified normal B cells (n=15), irrespectively to the major biologic prognosticators. Conclusions specific gene-sets and GEP were documented to be associated with response or resistance to Nutlin-3 exposure in p53 wt or p53 del/mut CLL. These findings may help to identify novel molecular targets for CLL therapy. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
