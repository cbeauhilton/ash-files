    "abstract_text": "While autologous T cell therapies can effectively treat B-cell leukemia and lymphoma, the personalized manufacturing process is difficult to scale, expensive and may fail. Even when autologous products are successfully manufactured, they are not immediately available to acutely ill patients. \"Off-the-shelf\" T cell products derived from healthy donors that can rapidly be administered, would improve accessibility and reduce the cost of T cell therapy. However, major obstacles to successful allogeneic T cell products include their potential for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection, mediated by host and recipient alloreactive T cells respectively. To address GVHD, we are using Epstein-Barr Virus-specific T cells (EBVSTs) as our platform since they are virus specific rather than allospecific and have not produced GVHD in more than 300 allogeneic recipients. To prevent graft rejection we have introduced into these EBVSTs, a chimeric antigen receptor for CD30 (CD30.CAR). CD30 is upregulated during the activation of alloreactive T cells, which leads to them becoming targets. The CD30.CAR provides the additional advantage of targeting CD30-positive lymphoma and has proved safe and effective in prior clinical trials (NCT02917083) using autologous CAR-T cells. Hence, we expect off-the-shelf CD30.CAR EBVSTs to eliminate the alloreactive T cells they elicit in allogeneic hosts, and therefore persist for sufficient time to eliminate CD30-positive lymphoma, without causing GVHD. Here we show that CD30.CAR-EBVSTs resist fratricide by masking their own CD30 molecules expressed in cis , but are nonetheless protected from rejection when co-cultured with alloreactive T cells expressing CD30 in trans . Notably, CD30.CAR EBVSTs preserve the function of both their TCR and the CD30.CAR, with retention of EBV specificity and the ability to eliminate CD30-positive tumor cells. We have manufactured a bank of clinical grade CD30.CAR EBVSTs from donors with HLA types designed to provide a partial HLA match for our diverse recipients. Clinical grade CD30.CAR EBVST cultures readily expanded to sufficient numbers for a planned clinical trial and expressed the CD30.CAR on 77% to 99% of cells. All of the lines passed functional release criteria of having greater than 100 IFN\u0263 spot-forming units (SFU) per 10 5 cells in response to both latent and lytic EBV antigens, and greater than 20% specific cytolysis against a CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma cell line, HDLM2, at an effector to target ratio of 20:1. Although CD30.CAR killing is not HLA restricted, we will select the CD30.CAR EBVST product for each recipient, based on the best HLA class I and class II match. This will allow endogenous EBV to boost the in vivo activity of CD30.CAR EBVSTs, and will provide additional reactivity for patients with CD30-positive and EBV-positive tumors. The IND for the clinical trial (NCT04288726) has been approved and we will recruit patients with CD30-positive lymphomas including Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and NK/T cell lymphoma. In summary, we present an approach to making an off-the-shelf T cell therapy that can rapidly translate to the clinic, requires no gene editing, and can serve as a platform for other CAR/TCRs to target a multiplicity of malignancies.
