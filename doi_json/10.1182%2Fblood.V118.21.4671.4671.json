    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4671 Introduction: VerifyNow P2Y12 is commonly used to measure responsiveness to clopidogrel. We sought to compare the results obtained from novel INNOVANCE \u00ae PFA P2Y and VerifyNow P2Y12 assay for the assessment of clopidogrel resistance in patients with undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Methods: 255 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, preliminarily treated with 100 mg/day of aspirin followed co- administration of clopidogrel(loading dose 600 mg, maintenance dose 75 mg/day), were enrolled in this study. Platelet aggregation was measured by INNOVANCE \u00ae PFA P2Y and VerifyNow P2Y12. Results: INNOVANCE \u00ae PFA P2Y and VerifyNow P2Y12 assay showed moderate correlations with INNOVANCE \u00ae PFA P2Y Vs VerifyNow %inhibition: r = 0.412, p < 0.0001; INNOVANCE \u00ae PFA P2Y Vs VerifyNow platelet reactivity units(PRU): r = \u22120.402, p < 0.0001. The agreement between INNOVANCE \u00ae PFA P2Y and VerifyNow %inhibition was 85 % and that of INNOVANCE \u00ae PFA P2Y and VerifyNow platelet reactivity units(PRU) was 79%: The k statistics between INNOVANCE \u00ae PFA P2Y and VerifyNow %inhibition and platelet reactivity units(PRU) were 0.52 and 0.44, respectively. Conclusions: INNOVANCE \u00ae PFA P2Y\u2019s sensitivity in detecting clopidogrel resistance is comparable to VerifyNow P2Y12 assay. As the PFA-100 \u00ae system was already widely used, the new test cartilage may be useful tool for the assessment of clopidogrel effects. Additional Clinical correlation studies were required to validate the effectiveness of INNOVANCE \u00ae PFA P2Y for predicting long term clinical outcomes.
