    "abstract_text": "Understanding the genomic and epigenetic mechanisms of drug resistance in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is critical for further improvements in treatment outcome. The role of transcriptomic response in conferring resistance to l-asparaginase (LASP) is poorly understood, beyond asparagine synthetase (ASNS). We defined reproducible LASP response genes in LASP resistant and sensitive ALL cell lines (n = 7) as well as primary leukemia samples from newly diagnosed patients. We identified 2219 response genes (absolute log 2 FC > 1.5, FDR p-value <0.05) with ~16.5% being reproduced in more than one cell line. Defining target genes of the amino acid stress response related transcription factor ATF4 in ALL cell lines using ChIP-seq revealed 25% of genes that changed expression after LASP treatment were direct targets of the ATF4 transcription factor. A total of 17,117 significantly differentially bound ATF4 sites were identified (FDR p-value <0.01) and 97.8% of these sites displayed an increase in ATF4 binding following LASP treatment. SLC7A11 was found to be a response gene in cell lines and patient samples as well as a direct target of ATF4. SLC7A11 was also one of only 2.4% of response genes with basal level gene expression that also correlated with LASP ex vivo resistance in primary leukemia cells from 212 newly diagnosed children enrolled on St. Jude Total Therapy 16. Experiments using chemical inhibition of SLC7A11 with sulfasalazine, gene overexpression, and partial gene knockout recapitulated LASP resistance or sensitivity in ALL cell lines. These findings show the importance of assessing changes in gene expression following treatment with an antileukemic agent for its association with drug resistance and highlights that many response genes may not differ in their basal expression in drug resistant leukemia cells.
