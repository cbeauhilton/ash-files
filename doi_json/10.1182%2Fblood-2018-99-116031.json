    "abstract_text": "Background : BAY 94\u20109027 is a B-domain-deleted recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) that is site-specifically PEGylated with a 60-kDa (2 x 30-kDa) polyethylene glycol (PEG) to extend its half-life. The efficacy and safety of BAY 94-9027 as prophylactic and on-demand therapy for patients with severe hemophilia A were demonstrated in the phase II/III PROTECT VIII trial, in which patients could receive prophylaxis every 7 days (E7D), every 5 days (E5D), or twice-weekly (2\u00d7W). Patients in the E5D arm had a low median annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of 1.9. This post hoc analysis was conducted to identify clinical predictors for 'best responders' (patients with ABR = 0) during E5D prophylaxis with BAY 94-9027 in PROTECT VIII. Methods : PROTECT VIII was a partially randomized, open-label trial of 134 males aged 12-65 years with severe hemophilia A (FVIII < 1%) and \u2265 150 FVIII exposure days. Prophylaxis patients received BAY 94-9027 25 IU/kg 2\u00d7W for a 10-week run-in period. Patients with \u2264 1 spontaneous joint or muscle bleed during this period were randomized to 45\u201260 IU/kg E5D or 60 IU/kg E7D for the main 26-week study period; patients enrolling after the randomization arms were full, or with \u2265 2 bleeds in the run-in period, received 30-40 IU/kg 2\u00d7W. All patients randomized to the E5D arm (n = 43) remained on this dose-frequency throughout the main study. This post hoc analysis presents a description of baseline characteristics of best responders to E5D dosing, defined as patients with ABR = 0 during the main study period; the study was not powered to support a formal statistical comparison. Results : Of 43 patients randomized to E5D dosing, 24 (55.8%) had ABR \u2265 1 and 19 (44.2%) had ABR = 0, meeting the criterion for best responders. The median (95% CI) age was slightly higher for best responders, 38 years [30.0; 47.0] versus 31.5 [24.0; 41.0]), than patients with ABR \u2265 1. In the 12 months prior to the study, best responders had lower median (95% CI) bleeds (2.0 [0.0; 5.0] versus 10.0 [3.0; 21.0]) and joint bleeds (0.0 [0.0; 2.0] versus 8.0 [2.0; 12.0]) compared with patients with ABR \u2265 1. Most patients in both groups had previously received prophylaxis prior to study (84.2% and 70.8%, respectively). Fewer best responders had target joints (57.9%, versus 70.8% of patients with ABR \u2265 1); and those who did have target joints only 36.4% had \u2265 1 target joint, versus 47.1% of patients with ABR \u2265 1. Conclusions : Overall, the 43 patients receiving BAY 94-9027 E5D prophylaxis had a low median ABR of 1.9. The 19 of these patients who had an ABR of 0 (best responders) had numerically fewer bleeds in the 12 months prior to treatment initiation, particularly joint bleeds, and numerically fewer target joints, vs patients with ABR \u2265 1. Though requiring validation in a powered study, taken together, these results suggest the applicability of E5D BAY 94-9027 dosing across patient profiles, and that patients with a similar bleed and joint profile to those analyzed here may be able to achieve ABR of 0 with E5D BAY 94-9027.
