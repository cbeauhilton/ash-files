    "abstract_text": "Ca 15-3 is a glycoprotein present in the cells of the mammary carcinoma and in some epithelial cells. Is a marker used for the monitoring of the breast and gastrointestinal carcinoma. The megaloblastic anaemia is an anaemia characterized by deficit of absorption of Vitamin B12 and is associated with gastritis atrophic and the target cell is the parietal gastric cell. In our institution, from June 2003 to December 2004, the level of Ca15-3 and of others tumour markers (CEA; Ca125; Ca19.9; alfa-FETO) they have been tested in the serum of 16 patients (9 male and 7 female with median age of 64,5 and range of 37\u201380 years) with de novo megaloblastic anaemia, 2 patients were gastrectomized. In all patients has been effected: esophagogastroduodenoscopy and control anti-parietal gastric cells antibody (APCA). Increase level in the serum of CA 15-3 with normal level of other tumour markers have been found in 14/16 patient with median value of 61 U/ml (range 35\u2013100 U/ml) in two patients (gastrectomized) the value of CA 15-3 was normal. Besides in 12/14 patients have shown positivity for the APCA, only in two patients has been diagnosed a gastritis atrophic, in the other patients has been observed a normal gastric mucous. After a median observation of 24 months any patient has developed a mammary or gastro-intestinal carcinoma These results indicate what the increased level of CA 15-3 antigen in patient with megaloblastic anaemia is positively correlated with APCA and with the presence of a normal gastric mucous. These clinical conditions make to suppose the destruction from the APCA of the parietal gastric cells with the liberation of this glycoprotein and this is shown in two patients gastrectomized with presence of APCA and not increased level of the CA 15-3. In conclusion the CA15-3 antigen is probably an specific marker for the diagnosis of megaloblastic anaemia and is probably associated with the destruction of parietal gastric cells.",
