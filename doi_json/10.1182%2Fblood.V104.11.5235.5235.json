    "abstract_text": "We evaluated intensive chemotherapy prior to PBSC mobilization vs. G-CSF alone for PBPC mobilization in a randomized controlled trial of 143 patients who received high dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 6 g/m 2 , thiotepa 750 mg/m 2 and BCNU 450 mg/m 2 over 3 days with PBSC support for treatment of breast cancer. 74 patients were randomized to chemomobilization with cisplatin 135 mg/m 2 , etoposide 1200 mg/m 2 , and cyclophosphamide 4.5 g/m 2 over 3 days plus G-CSF (6mcg/kg q12h)(CVP-G), while 69 patients received G-CSF alone with the collection goal >4 x 10 6 CD34(+) cells/kg. 77 patients were stage II\u2013III, 66 were stage IV. The CVP-G group had improved mobilization with a collection of 18 (range 3\u2013141) x 10 6 CD34(+) cells/kg compared with 4(2\u201313) x 10 6 /kg for the G-CSF group (p40]. Only one patient in the G-CSF alone group collected >9 x 10 6 CD34(+) cells. In the CVP-G group progression trended toward being reduced in patients with CD34(+) cell doses collected of >9 x 10 6 /kg (57\u00b19% vs. 65\u00b111%, p=0.06) This effect was consistent for all stages. Overall survival was improved in the CVP-G patients collecting \u22659 x 10 6 CD34(+)/kg 62\u00b17% vs. 27\u00b111% those collecting less. For patients receiving CD34(+) doses \u22649 x 10 6 /kg, the progression rate was 65\u00b111% in the CVP-G group and 68\u00b16% in the G-CSF group (p=NS). Higher doses of CD34(+) cells collected by chemomobilization than G-CSF alone and those patients with the higher doses of CD34(+) collected trended toward lower disease progression after high dose chemotherapy.",
