Enzymes that participate in this process are the collagen prolyl-3 hydroxylases (C-P3H) and the C-P4H. We have previously showed that P3H3 is methylated in multiple solid tumour types, whereas methylation in P3H2 appears to be specific for breast cancer and multiple myeloma (MM). In this study we assessed the CpG methylation status of the P3H genes (P3H1, P3H2, P3H3) in a larger cohort of MM patients and for the first time the CpG methylation status of the P4H genes (P4HA1, P4HA2, P4HA3) and investigated for clinical relevance. Patients and Methods: Bone marrow aspirate samples from 47 MM patients (28 males, median age 66 years) were obtained at diagnosis. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was employed to study the CpG methylation in P3H1, P3H2, P3H3, P4HA1, P4HA2 and P4HA3 CpG islands. Genomic DNA was isolated and bisulphite modified using commercially available kits (QIAmp DNA mini kit, Qiagen and EZ DNA methylation kit, Zymo Research respectively). Control methylated and unmethylated genomic DNAs were included in each experiment. For the study of the P3H2 CpG methylation status we used 2 sets of independent primers, which map to different areas of P3H2 CpG island. Ten bone marrow samples from patients with border line thrombocytopenia that were proved to have no neoplasia served as negative controls. Logistic regression analyses were used to measure the association between gene methylation and age, b2 microglobulin, serum albumin, hypercalcemia, ISS stage, extramedullary disease, bone disease, anemia and renal failure (eGFR< 50 ml/min). Results: None of the six genes under study was methylated in the control bone marrow samples. Methylation in the CpG island of P3H2 was detected in 44 % of patients (95% CI 27.8\u201362.8%) No methylation was detected in the CpG islands of P3H1, P3H3, P4HA1, P4HA2 and P4HA3. Trends noted were that patients with methylated P3H2 were more likely to have ISS stage 3 (OR 2.2, p=0.1). Overall no significant association was found with any clinical parameter although the study might have been underpowered due to the small population size. Conclusions: P3H2 is methylated at high frequency in MM, whereas P3H1, P3H3, P4HA1, P4HA2, P4HA3 were unmethylated, implying a striking specificity for methylation in P3H2 in MM. These findings warrant further evaluation in a larger sample of patients in order to better define the prognostic and clinical utility of P3H2 methylation in MM.
