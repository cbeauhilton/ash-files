    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The JAK/STAT pathway is frequently activated in peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) and cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs) however the utility of JAK inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in these diseases is not known. We hypothesize that JAK/STAT pathway alteration (defined by elevated phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3) expression or presence of JAK or STAT mutations) will predict for sensitivity to JAK inhibition in PTCL and CTCL. We are conducting a phase II study of ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, in which we assess its efficacy in a cohort of patients (pts) with PTCL and CTCL enriched for JAK/STAT pathway alterations. Methods : This is an investigator-initiated multi-center phase II study evaluating the efficacy of ruxolitinib 20mg twice daily in PTCL and CTCL. Pts with relapsed or refractory (rel/ref) PTCL or CTCL following at least 1 systemic therapy are eligible to enroll onto one of three of the following cohorts: Cohort 1 : Disease determined to have JAK or STAT mutations. Cohort 2: Disease with functional evidence of JAK/STAT activation (defined as \u2265 30% pSTAT3 expression by immunohistochemistry). Cohort 3: Disease does not meet criteria for cohort 1 or 2. Pts initially enrolled onto cohort 3 and determined to have JAK/STAT mutations or functional JAK/STAT activation after enrollment are moved to cohorts 1 or 2. Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 are enrolling up to 17, 17 and 18 pts respectively by Simon 2-stage design. Pts receive treatment until progression and are assessed for response to therapy after cycles 2, 5 and every three cycles thereafter. Results: The first stage has been completed for cohorts 1 and 3 and 33 out of planned 52 pts enrolled to date. Details regarding histology, mutations, and treatment course appear in the table and figure. For Cohort 1 , 10 out of planned 17 pts enrolled. Mutations involved JAK1 (1), JAK3 (3), STAT3 (4), and STAT5B (4). Out of 8 evaluable pts, overall response rate (ORR) was 38% with 3 partial responses (PR). In addition, 3 pts have ongoing stable disease (SD) lasting 8-18 months. Altogether, 75% achieved clinical benefit (objective response or SD >6 months). For Cohort 2 , 5 out of planned 17 pts enrolled. Among the 5 evaluable pts, ORR was 40% with 1 complete response (CR) and 1 PR. For Cohort 3 , 18 pts out of planned 18 pts enrolled. Out of 14 evaluable pts, ORR was 21% with 3 PRs. Grade 3 or higher drug-related adverse events (AEs) observed among the 33 pts enrolled included anemia (4), neutropenia (7), thrombocytopenia (2), and lymphopenia (7). Treatment related serious adverse events (SAEs) included 1 episode each of HSV-1 stomatitis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, febrile neutropenia, and herpes zoster. Conclusion: Responses observed across all three cohorts of pts with PTCL and CTCL with a trend towards higher rates and more durable responses among pts with JAK/STAT alterations. Efficacy of ruxolitinib in PTCL and CTCL provides proof of concept that JAK/STAT activation is a viable target in T-cell lymphomas. Enrollment onto cohorts 1 and 2 and assessment for JAK/STAT alternations among pts in cohort 3 continues. Figure. View large Download slide Figure.
