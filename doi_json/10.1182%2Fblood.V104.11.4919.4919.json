    "abstract_text": "The clinical characteristics and treatment results of the multiple myeloma patients admitted to our hospital from January 1980 to December 2002 were retrospectively analyzed and compared in order to put forward a feasible therapeutic strategy for MM in China. Results : 1. Clinical characteristics (1) 432 cases with full follow-up statistics were analyzed. The median age was 57 years (20 to 80).The peak onset age were 50 to 60 years. The ratio of male to female was 2.35:1. (2) 81% patients had anemia(Hb<100 g/L) at diagnosis. The median proportion of tumor cells in the bone marrow was 0.38 (0.005\u20130.970). 72.1% with high \u03b2 2 -MG (>3mg/L), 60% of the patients had abnormities in X-rays. (3) M-protein peak was detected in 78.5% patients. IgG made up the majority in classification(48.1%), IgA (21.8%)and light-chain(20.5%)next to it. 144 patients were in stage IIIA(40%), and 87 cases in IIIB(24.1%)at first diagnosis. (4) The median survival duration was 27 months (1\u2013137months). 2. Treatment results : 206 cases had integral therapeutic records in 432 patients. (1) 200 patients were administered with drugs therapy, and their 3-year and 5-year survival were 32.01% and 15.8% respectively. The OS, median survival, 3-year and 5-year survival in MP group(n=46) were 30.4%, 30 months, 21.96% and 13.2% respectively. 149 cases(72.3%)received multi-drug combined chemotherapy(CCT).The overall response was 50.3% and significant higher than that of MP group(P=0.01).While the median survival duration(30.5 months), 3-year and 5-year survival rates (35% and 16.7% respectively) were as same as MP group (P>0.05. (2). 38/200 cases (19%) were treated with interferon in combination with chemotherapy over 6 months. The overall response rates were 53.6%, and the median survival duration was 52 months, and presented an increased response(P=0.02)and a prolonged survival duration (P=0.0003) compared with the no interferon group(34.4%,27months respectively. (3)Thalidomide was administered to 29 cases(14.5%), including 5 who took it alone(2.5%). The overall response rates were 50.3%. (4) 6 patients received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 5 patients with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation were alive averagely in 73\u00b112.5 months by the end of the follow-up. Conclusion: 1) MM patients in China had poor prognostic characteristics except of younger age compared with the westerns, especially most patients were diagnosed at III phase with significant lower survival. 2) CCT yielded higher response rates but no longer duration of survival benefit than MP when used as treatment for MM. INF-a and Thalidomide could benefit MM by combination with chemotherapy. Among patients who are <60 years old with good performance, HSC could prolong survival duration."
