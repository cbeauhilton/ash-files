    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5117 Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) is characterized by recurrent translocations of 17q21, which result in expression of fusion proteins of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR\u03b1). We have been studying the t(5;17)(q35;q21) variant of APL, which fuses the N-terminal 117 amino acids of nucleophosmin (NPM) to the C-terminus of RAR\u03b1. NPM-RAR is capable of binding to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs), and we have previously shown that NPM-RAR can recruit both corepressor and coactivator complexes to retinoic acid target promoters, to modulate transcription in a ligand-dependent fashion, though with a different sensitivity to ligand than RAR\u03b1. The N-terminal NPM-sequence of NPM-RAR contains a dimerization domain capable of mediating not only homodimerization of the fusion protein, but also heterodimerization with wild-type NPM, to potentially modulate NPM functionality. NPM serves as a molecular chaperone, and binds to a diverse set of proteins. Amongst these are the p50 and p65 subunits of NF\u03baB. NPM has been shown to serve as a coactivator for the NF\u03baB transcriptional complex. We hypothesized that NPM-RAR might interact with NPM to modulate NF\u03baB dependent transcription. We focused on NF\u03baB regulation of the Superoxide Dismutase 2 (MnSOD, SOD2) promoter, since NPM regulation of NF\u03baB mediated transcription has been most extensively studied in this model system. We found that NPM-RAR enhances both basal and TNF\u03b1-induced transcription of an NF\u03baB-reporter construct (containing a minimal MnSOD promoter/enhancer) in HepG2 and Hela cells. This effect was not dependent upon translocation of NF\u03baB to the nucleus, indicating that the positive effect on NF\u03baB was mediated downstream of the canonical activation pathway of NF\u03baB. The MnSOD promoter does not contain a consensus RARE, and this effect was not seen in cells transfected with RAR\u03b1, suggesting that this effect is not mediated through the DNA binding motifs of the NPM-RAR C-terminal RAR\u03b1 sequences. NPM-RAR does not directly interact with NF\u03baB; preliminary experiments using siRNA to down-regulate NPM indicate that NPM-RAR enhancement of MnSOD transcription is dependent upon the presence of wild-type NPM. This leads us to propose a model whereby NPM-RAR binds to the NPM/NF\u03baB transcriptional complex through interaction with NPM, to enhance NF\u03baB mediated transcription.
