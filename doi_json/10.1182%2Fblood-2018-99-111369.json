    "abstract_text": "Background : Ibrutinib (ibr), a first-in-class, once-daily inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, is approved in the US and EU for patients (pts) with CLL and allows for treatment without chemotherapy. Standard of care for first-line CLL in older pts or those with comorbidities includes single-agent ibr or chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) with chlorambucil (clb) plus anti-CD20 therapy. As no data were available from phase 3 studies directly comparing single-agent ibr with CIT, we performed a cross-trial analysis using data from two phase 3 studies to assess single-agent ibr vs clb plus obinutuzumab (G) in first-line CLL. Methods : In the ongoing PCYC-1115/1116 (RESONATE-2), pts with previously untreated CLL/SLL aged \u226565 years without del(17p) were randomized to receive ibr (420 mg once daily continuously) or clb. In PCYC-1130 (iLLUMINATE), pts with untreated CLL/SLL aged \u226565 years or <65 years with coexisting conditions or del17p/ TP53 mutation were randomized to receive ibr plus 6 cycles of G or 6 cycles of clb-G. As pts with del(17p) were ineligible for RESONATE-2, pts with del(17p) in iLLUMINATE were excluded from cross-trial analyses. Primary analysis was investigator (INV)-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) with single-agent ibr in RESONATE-2 vs clb-G in iLLUMINATE; secondary analyses were PFS in the high-risk population (del(11)q, TP53 mutation, or unmutated IGHV ), medical resource utilization in the first 6 mo, and safety (including time-matched analysis at 6 mo to account for different treatment durations). Additional exploratory analyses compared single-agent ibr in RESONATE-2 vs ibr-G in iLLUMINATE to evaluate lymphocytosis (\u226550% increase in absolute lymphocyte count from baseline and \u22655 \u00d7 10 9 /L), and overall response rate (ORR). Results : Primary analysis included 136 pts treated with single-agent ibr and 98 pts treated with clb-G. Median age was 73 years in both groups. High-risk genomic features were generally well balanced (54% and 58% of pts, respectively), including del(11q) (21% and 22%), TP53 mutations (9% and 5%), and unmutated IGHV (43% and 46%). Bulky disease (\u22655 cm) was present in 40% and 37% of pts, respectively. Median follow-up was 48.8 mo for ibr and 31.3 mo for clb-G. Single-agent ibr significantly prolonged PFS compared with clb-G (median not reached [NR] vs 22.2 mo), with an 82% reduction in risk of progression or death (HR 0.184; P <0.0001; Figure 1). PFS rates at 30 mo were 85% vs 40% for ibr vs clb-G. Superior PFS with ibr vs clb-G was also seen in the high-risk population (median NR vs 18.3 mo; HR 0.072; P <0.0001), with a 93% reduction in risk of progression or death. PFS consistently favored ibr over clb-G across all subgroups examined. Median treatment duration was 46.9 mo for ibr and 5.1 mo for clb-G, resulting in an AE collection period that was 9 times longer for ibr. Hospitalizations were similar for ibr vs clb-G (26% vs 28% of pts), while use of blood supportive products (16% vs 20%) or growth factors (6% vs 41%) was lower for ibr. Most common grade \u22653 adverse events (AEs) are in Table 1. During the first 6 mo, AEs led to discontinuation (DC) of ibr in 7% and DC of clb-G in 18% of pts; over the entire AE reporting period, AEs led to DC of ibr in 26%, and DC of clb-G in 18% of pts; (Table 1). With ibr, AEs leading to ibr DC in \u22652 pts were atrial fibrillation (n = 4), palpitations, pneumonia, death, and CLL (n = 2 each). With clb-G, AEs leading to DC of either clb or G in \u22652 pts were infusion-related reaction (n = 6) and neutropenia (n = 4). Exploratory analyses included 136 pts treated with single-agent ibr and 99 pts treated with ibr-G. Median follow-up was 31.3 mo for ibr-G. ORR by INV was similar with ibr vs ibr-G (91% vs 92%), but complete response (CR/CRi) was higher for ibr-G (44% vs 27%; P =0.006). Lymphocytosis occurred in 57% vs 8% of pts with ibr vs ibr-G and resolved in 95% vs 100%; median duration of lymphocytosis was 12.4 vs 3.1 weeks, respectively. Conclusions : Despite limitations of this cross-trial analysis, results suggest that PFS with single-agent ibr was superior to clb-G, including, importantly, in patients with high-risk genomic characteristics or bulky disease. In a time-matched analysis, AE profile with single-agent ibr appeared favorable to clb-G. In comparing ibr and ibr-G, lymphocytosis was more common with ibr than ibr-G but resolved in almost all pts, and ORR was similar for ibr and ibr-G. While CR rate was higher for ibr-G vs ibr, CR was not needed to achieve long-term PFS benefit with single-agent ibr.
