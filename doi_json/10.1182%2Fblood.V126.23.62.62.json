    "abstract_text": "Purpose and design The effect of HLA-identical sibling donor (ISDs) haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) on adults with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in the first complete remission (CR1) has been established. Our recent single-institute, retrospective study showed that haploidentical HSCT was superior to chemotherapy alone for patients with high-risk ALL in CR1. To test the hypothesis that haploidentical HSCT would be a valid option as post-remission therapy for ALL patients in CR1 lacking a matched donor, we designed a disease-specific, prospective, multi-centre study. Patients Between July 2010 and Dec 2013, 186 patients with Philadelphia-negative high-risk ALL were biologically randomized to undergo un-manipulated HIDs (103 patients) or ISDs HSCT (83 patients) according to donor availability. Results Among HIDs and ISDs recipients, the 3-year disease free survival (DFS) rate was 68% and 64% (P =.56), respectively; overall survival (OS) rate was 75% and 69% (P = .51, respectively; cumulative incidences of relapse were 18% and 24% (P = .30), and those of the non-relapse-mortality (NRM) were 13% and 11% (P = .84), respectively. The 28-d myeloid recovery rates were both 99% in each group; the incidences of severe acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD were also comparable between the two groups. Among recipients of transplantations from HIDs, no significant differences in DFS, OS, or NRM were observed between 3/6 and 4-5/6 matched grafts; in contrast, maternal donor was related with lower OS compared with other donor sources (P = .04); limited chronic GVHD was associated with better DFS (P = .01). The stem cell source had no effect on DFS. Conclusion Un-manipulated haploidentical-HSCT achieves outcomes similar to those of ISD-HSCT for Philadelphia-negative high-risk ALL patients in CR1. Such transplantation was proved to be a valid alternative as post-remission treatment for high-risk ALL patients in CR1 lacking an identical donor. (Chictr.org.cn number ChiCTR-OCH-10000940) Table.
