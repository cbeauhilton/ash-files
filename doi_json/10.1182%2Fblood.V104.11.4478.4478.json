    "abstract_text": "Many types of antitumor therapy in general and AML in particular exert their effect by activating apoptosis. Apoptosis of AML cells can be induced by cytostatic drugs, corticosteroids, and radiation. Recently, the role of different proteases as possible targets for chemotherapy was described. N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), a chymotrypsin-like protease (CLP) inhibitor was shown to exert a dual effect on leukemic cells: proapoptotic and antiapoptotic. In the present study the mechanism of its proapoptotic effect was addressed. It was found that the CLP inhibitors, TPCK and 3,4 dichloroisicoumarine induced apoptosis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Apoptosis was accompanied by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 (but not caspase-8) activation, PS flip-flop (measured by Annexin-V staining followed by flow cytometry analysis) and chromatin condensation, but not fragmentation (detected by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining). All apoptotic processes induced by TPCK were completely inhibited by cycloheximide. The ability of cycloheximide to inhibit TPCK-induced cell death suggests that protein synthesis plays a role in TPCK-induced apoptosis. Additionaly, the proapoptotic effect of TPCK was abolished by elimination of glucose from the medium. The data supports the role of mitochondria in this process. In the present study the apoptotic pathway driven by inhibition of CLP was demonstrated. Moreover, these findings suggest possible ways of preventing the proapoptotic activity of TPCK and thereby enhancimg its antiapoptotic action.",
