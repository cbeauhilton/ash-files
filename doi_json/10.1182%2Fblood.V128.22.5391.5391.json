    "abstract_text": "Background : DRL-Rituximab (T) is a proposed biosimilar of rituximab . The similarity of DRL-Rituximab andtheinnovator reference products(USA: Rituxan\u00ae; European Union: Mabthera\u00ae [R]) has been demonstrated in physicochemical analyses and nonclinical studies. This study was undertaken to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of T with R sourced from the European Union. Methods : Multiple-center, randomized, double-blind, two-arm, parallel-group study conducted in patients of both genders, aged 18-60 with a centrally confirmed newly diagnosed CD20 positive diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in their first line of treatment. Patients were randomized to receive 6 cycles of 21 days either T or R at an initial dose of 375 mg/m2 along with chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone/prednisolone (CHOP). The primary objective of this study was to compare the PK of T and R. One of the secondary objectives was to establish the similarity of T and R in the pharmacodynamic parameters - as B-cell depletion and repletion in peripheral blood using counts of CD19+ positive cells determined by flow cytometry. The PK similarity criterion was that the 90% confidence intervals (CI) of the geometric mean ratios of AUC 0-21days , and C max in Cycle 1 were within 80.00% - 125.00%. Cycle 1 PK, PD and summary safety results are reported here. Other PK parameters were evaluated as secondary endpoints. Results : A total of 151 patients were randomized to the study (76 to T, 75 to R). After exclusion of 2 patients with very low exposure (results confirmed to be outliers by a z-score higher than 3 and currently under further investigation), both products met the preset Cycle 1 PK similarity criterion (Table 1), with these 2 patients included the C max criterion was met, but for AUC the lower limit of the CI was 78.36% (Table 2). PK parameter values were generally comparable (Table 3). For PD both products appear comparable regarding both B-cell depletion and B-cell repletion, both in terms of proportion of patients as well as median time to depletion/repletion. (Table 4 & Figures 1A and 1B) Safety was also comparable between both products. Grade 3/4 Adverse Events (AEs) showed a similar trend in incidence across the two treatment arms [overall: 121 (80.1%); T: 57 (75.0%); R: 64 (85.3%)]. Neutropenia was the most frequently reported of the grade 3/4 AEs, followed by febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, and anaemia. The most commonly reported TEAEs related to the study drug were neutropenia [overall: 48 (31.8%); T: 29 (38.2%); R: 19 (25.3%)] and leukopenia [overall: 24 (15.9%); T: 16 (21.1%); R: 8 (10.7%)]. A total of 5 deaths are reported in the study amounting to 3.3% fatality rate . Conclusion : DRL-rituximab has equivalent PK profile to Mabthera in Cycle 1 when given in combination with standard CHOP chemotherapy for the treatment of CD20 positive DLBCL. PD and safety results are also similar. While awaiting results of further PK/PD data as well as outcomes from this trial, these results are highly encouraging and provide further impetus to development of DRL-rituximab as a candidate rituximab biosimilar.
