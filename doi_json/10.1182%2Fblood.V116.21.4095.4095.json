    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4095 Background: Symptomatic burden in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) is present in over 70% of MPN patients (Mesa et. al. Cancer 2007). We sought to validate a broadly applicable instrument (MPN-SAF) to assess symptoms in myelofibrosis (MF), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV). Methods: Using the previously validated MF-SAF as a base instrument, we added several key additional symptoms previously identified as present in all subtypes of MPNs including headaches, concentration, dizziness, extremity tingling, insomnia, sexual problems and mood changes on a 0 (absent) to 10 (worst-imaginable) scale. Validation: The MPN-SAF was administered jointly with the EORTC-QLQ-C30 as the co-validation instrument using prospective cohorts in the USA, Sweden and Italy. The translated MPN-SAF (Swedish and Italian) was created through a standard approach using teams of 4 translators working in concert. Results: Compiled MPN-SAF: Patient data: 402 MPN-SAF surveys were administered (English (25%), Italian (46%) and Swedish (28%)) in 161 ET patients (40%), 145 PV patients (36%), and 96 MF patients (24%), an average of 7.8 years (range 0 \u2013 43 years) from their MPN diagnosis. Participants were of typical age (64.9, range 26 \u2013 91 years) and gender (53% female) characteristic of disease. Prior hemorrhage (10%) and thrombosis (25%) were frequent. 68% of patients currently received cytoreductive therapy and 84% received cytoreductive therapy in the past. Patients and Symptomatic Burden: 19 items assessed in the MPN-SAF demonstrated consistently that the most common symptoms were fatigue (93%), decreased quality of life (84%), insomnia (65%), sad mood (65%), and sexuality problems (58%). The least common symptoms (<50% prevalence) were fevers (20%), weight loss (35%), abdominal pain (46%), cough (46%), headache (48%), and bone pain (49%). Symptoms were most severe in MF, followed by PV, then ET patients. Although symptoms are present in all 3 MPN subgroups, itching is notably more burdensome in PV patients (65%, median score of 2.8 out of 10). Additionally, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, early satiety and inactivity all are most prevalent and severe in MF. Interestingly, night sweats (present in 56%) overall had similar prevalence and severity across all 3 MPNs. The majority found the MPN-SAF easy to understand (98%) and \u201caddressed most of my MPN symptoms\u201d (96%). Comparison to EORTC-QLQ-C30: Strong correlations existed between individual items represented on both the MPN-SAF and the EORTC-QLQC30 including pain, fatigue, appetite and insomnia (all p<0.001). Additionally key symptomatic elements were highly correlated with the EORTC QLQ-C30 functional subscales. Comparison to Physician Perceptions: Comparison of the results of the MPN-SAF to enrolling physicians' blinded opinion of patients symptoms (6 assessed - night sweats, fevers, fatigue, weight loss, bone pain, and pruritus) showed excellent correlation with corresponding patients' responses except bone pain (all p<0.001). Comparison across Countries: When controlling for MPN subtype, responses between the three different countries (and 3 different languages the MPN-SAF was administered) demonstrated great consistency and correlation for all but 1 item, bone pain. Serial MPN-SAF Results: 51 patients in the USA (ET (17.6%), PV (25.5%), and MF (56.9%)), responded to a repeat MPN-SAF survey sent via US mail (50% response rate, mean time between surveys 190\u00b163 days (range 43 \u2013 257)). Pearson correlations indicate that most MPN-SAF items are well correlated (r >0.5, p0.7, 2, k model used). Conclusion: The MPN-SAF is comprehensive and reliable instrument which is available in multiple languages to evaluate MPN-associated symptoms. The MPN-SAF is recommended as a uniform symptom assessment tool for MPN patients participating in clinical trials globally. Disclosures: Vannucchi: Novartis: Consultancy. Samuelsson: Roche Sweden: .
