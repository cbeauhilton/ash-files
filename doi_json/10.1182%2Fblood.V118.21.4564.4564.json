    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4564 Background: Infectious complications remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the early phase after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of positive blood cultures and its potential correlation with different studied parameters in large patient population studied in the first 30 days after HSCT. Material and methods: 431 patients at median age of 47 years (range 18\u201385) transplanted between 2009\u20132011 for hematological and non-hematological malignancies were included in our analysis. There were 242 males and 189 females. Results: The indications for autologous and allogeneic HSCT were following: AML \u2013 105 (24%), NHL \u2013 86 (20%), MM \u2013 75 (17,5%), HL \u2013 48 (11%), ALL \u2013 40 (9%), MDS \u2013 17 (4%), AA \u2013 15 (3,5%), CML \u2013 12 (2,8%), PNH \u2013 11 (2,6%), connective tissue diseases \u2013 5 (1,2%), CLL \u2013 3 (0,7%) and other \u2013 14 (3,2%). The following transplant procedures were performed: ABCT \u2013 213 (49%), ABMT \u2013 3 (0,7%), alloBCT \u2013 56 (13%), alloBMT \u2013 21 (5%), URDBCT \u2013 87 (20%), URDBMT \u2013 51 (12%). Pre-transplant ATG and anti-CD52 antibody were used in 142 (33%) and 5 (1.2%) patients, respectively. Amongst 431 transplanted patients, 495 blood cultures were collected; range 0\u20138 (median 1). Eighty seven blood samples were positive (17,6%). The following pathogens were detected: gram-positive bacteria in 48% (n=42), gram-negative bacteria in 38% (n=33), fungi in 1% (n=1) and both G(+) and G(&minus;) bacteria in 13%(n=11). The gram-positive bacteria included: Staphylococcus epidermidis: 21 (50%), Micrococcus spp: 4 (9%), Enterococcus faecium: 3 (7%), Enterococcus faecalis: 3 (7%), Streptococcus haemolyticus: 3 (7%). The following gram-negative bacteria were found: Enterobacter cloacae: 10 (30%), Escherichia coli: 7 (21%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 5 (15%), Klebsiella pneumonia: 5 (15%). Candida albicans was detected only in one case. The use of ATG was associated with higher number of total blood draw and positive blood cultures. No significant correlation was found between the specific pathogen and the use of ATG. Male gender was associated with significantly higher number of blood sampling and with tendency to higher number of positive blood cultures. The type of conditioning regimen, the source of stem cell and the donor origin (auto vs sibling vs unrelated) did not influence the number of positive blood culture. There was tendency to higher number of blood intake, but not positive blood culture in patients transplanted in NR if compared to PR or CR. Conclusions: Positive blood cultures were positive in about 20% of patients after HSCT. Only pre-transplant ATG use was associated with the higher number of positive blood culture. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
