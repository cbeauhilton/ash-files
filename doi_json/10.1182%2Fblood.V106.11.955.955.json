    "abstract_text": "In most individuals, A and B blood group antigens are weakly expressed on platelets, allowing ABO incompatible platelets to be tolerated when transfused. However, in a minority of normal subjects (high expressers, H-Exp), platelets carry 10\u201320 times the usual number of A or B epitopes (up to 20,000/platelet, Blood  2000 ; 96 : 1574 ). Post-transfusion survival of incompatible H-Exp platelets has not been systematically studied. We recently encountered a family in which NATP in two infants appears to have been caused by maternal anti-B reacting with H-Exp fetal platelets inherited from a father with the group B H-Exp trait. The first two children (C1 and C2) born to a G4P2 group O mother and A 2 B father were positive for blood group B, and had neonatal thrombocytopenia (TP) (C1 = 33K/\u03bcL, C2 = 61K/\u03bcL), anemia, positive direct antiglobulin test, elevated reticuloytes and hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy. C1 required 3 platelet transfusions and RBC transfusion, and C2 required RBC transfusion. Both recovered in the immediate neonatal period. A third child (C3) inherited blood group A 2 from the father and was born with a normal platelet count. The parents were incompatible for HPA-2b and -3b, but no platelet-specific antibodies were detected in maternal serum. High titer IgG antibodies were detected in maternal serum against father\u2019s platelets in both flow cytometry and modified antigen capture ELISA. This activity was completely removed by absorption with normal, washed group B RBCs. When tested by flow cytometry with monoclonal anti-B and anti-A, the father\u2019s platelets were shown to carry 17 times the normal level of B antigen, and only trace amounts of A antigen. We previously showed that the potent glycosyltransferase activity associated with the H-Exp trait causes essentially all H antigen on platelets and RBCs to be converted to A and/or B antigen. Consistent with this, father\u2019s platelets and RBCs were found to express no detectable H. Quantitation of B and H antigens on platelets and RBCs from C1 and C2 is pending receipt of samples. Findings made in this family indicate that maternal anti-B (and presumably anti-A) IgG antibodies can cause NATP in infants with the ABO \u201chigh expresser\u201d trait. Maternal-fetal ABO incompatibility should be considered as a cause of NATP when maternal antibodies against platelet-specific antigens cannot be demonstrated. The possibility that ABO incompatibility can aggravate thrombocytopenia caused by antibodies against recognized platelet-specific antigens also deserves consideration."
