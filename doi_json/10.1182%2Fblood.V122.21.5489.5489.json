    "abstract_text": "Femoral head necrosis (FHN) is one of common complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). It impacts on patients' normal life with severe pain. To investigate FHN after allogeneic HSCT, We performed retrospective analyses. Since 2003, our department has conducted 98 cases of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with hematologic diseases. Chemotherapy regimens and transplant conditioning regimen before transplantation were steroid-free. FHN occurred in 3 out of 98 cases. The 3 patients were treated with steroid for preventing graft versus host disease (GVHD) after transplantation. However, all the three patients suffered from GVHD, which was cured with steroidal medication subsequently. Then, symptoms of FHN come out and were significantly improved after conservative treatment in all the three patients. The occurrence of FHN might be associated with GVHD and corticosteroids prescription. Early prevention might be helpful in reducing the incidence and improving outcomes.
