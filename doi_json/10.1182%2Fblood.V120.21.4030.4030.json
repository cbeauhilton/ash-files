    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4030 Age is a major prognostic factor for the outcome of patients with multiple myeloma (MM), due to more intensive treatment in younger vs. older patients, comorbidities and toxicity, resulting in early discontinuation of treatment in older patients or even differences in disease characteristics. It is believed that the longer survival of patients \u226465 years is, to a large extent, due to the receipt of more lines of therapy and thus they can have an extended survival even after relapse to first line therapy. In order to decipher these differences in the outcome of MM patients of different ages, we analyzed 438 consecutive, unselected patients who were treated in a single center (Department of Clinical Therapeutics, University of Athens School of Medicine) from April 1994 to April 2012, and compared the characteristics and outcome of patients \u226465 years (166 patients), which are usually treated with more intensive therapies (including HDT), to that of patients 66\u201375 years (154 patients) and >75 years of age (118 patients). Some of these patients were included in clinical trials; however, even patients who were ineligible because of poor performance status, renal impairment or comorbidities were also included, thus, being more representative of the general myeloma population. Differences in the characteristics of patients of different age groups are depicted in the table. Younger patients presented less often with ISS-3, severe anemia, renal impairment or impaired PS than older patients. However, there was no difference in the detection of high risk cytogenetics. Response was higher and deeper in younger patients. Early deaths, within 2 months from initiation of therapy, occurred more often in older patients. Median PFS was longer in younger patients. Similar proportion of patients who relapsed have received 2nd line therapy (p=0.365). Post relapse survival (PRS) was 31 months for patients \u226465 years, 20 months for patients 66\u201375 years and 15 months for patients >75 years (p75 years was also significant (p=0.004). Median OS was 71 months for patients 75 years (p<0.001). Thus, it seems that the OS of patients in each age group is distributed almost equally between the initial phase of the disease and post first relapse/progression (see Table ). PFS 75 years (p=0.003). PRS for patients with a PFS75 years. Median OS was significantly better for patients who achieved CR or VGPR (58 months) vs. patients who achieved a PR (39 months) (p75 years (p75 years (p=0.092) were independently associated with improved survival. In conclusion, our data indicate that the survival of MM patients is distributed almost equally between the initial phase i.e. before relapse to first line therapy, and to subsequent phases of their disease i.e. post relapse survival. This is observed across all age groups, but in patients \u226465 years the duration of first response is significantly longer, perhaps due to more intensive therapies and to less frequent early deaths. In this unselected series of patients, the 10-year free of progression rate was 6.5%. Table  . \u226465 years . 66\u201375 years . >75 years . p-value .
