    "abstract_text": "Background: A key component of maintenance chemotherapy for pediatric ALL is weekly oral methotrexate (MTX), typically given at 20 mg/m 2 /dose. Another component is steroid/vincristine pulses although there is uncertainty regarding their need or their optimal frequency. AALL0932 was designed to optimize maintenance therapy by asking two questions: (1) the potential superiority of a starting weekly oral MTX dose of 40 mg/m\u00b2/dose as compared to the standard 20 mg/m 2 /dose; and (2) whether giving vincristine/dexamethasone (VCR/DEX) pulses every 12 weeks was non-inferior to every 4 week pulses. Both oral MTX arms used identical dose modifications to adjust dose based on blood counts. Methods: AR patients had SR B-ALL without CNS3 or testicular leukemia, unfavorable genetic characteristics or Down syndrome, AND had either favorable genetics (presence of trisomies of chromosomes 4 &10 or ETV6/RUNX1 fusion) with Day 8 peripheral blood (PB) minimal residual disease (MRD) \u2265 0.01% or CNS2 status, Day 29 bone marrow (BM) MRD less than 0.01%, or if neutral cytogenetics, had Day 8 PB MRD less than 1% and Day 29 BM MRD less than 0.01%. AR patients were randomized to 1 of 4 Maintenance regimens using a 2 x 2 factorial design: (A): VCR/DEX pulses every 4 weeks and oral MTX 20 mg/m\u00b2/week (standard arm); (B): VCR/DEX pulses every 4 weeks and oral MTX 40 mg/m\u00b2/week; (C): VCR/DEX pulses every 12 weeks and oral MTX 20 mg/m\u00b2/week; and (D): VCR/DEX pulses every 12 weeks and oral MTX 40 mg/m\u00b2/week. Between 2010 and 2015, 2366 AR ALL patients were randomized at the start of maintenance to MTX 20 mg/m\u00b2/week [Arms A and C (n=1186)] or 40 mg/m\u00b2/week [Arms B & D (n=1180)] starting dose. Results: Interim monitoring of COG AALL0932 concluded that a futility boundary had been crossed and that the study would not be able to demonstrate that oral MTX 40 mg/m\u00b2/week is superior to 20 mg/m\u00b2/week. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) estimates for AR patients who received oral MTX 20 mg/m\u00b2/week vs. 40 mg/m\u00b2/week are 95 \u00b1 2.4% vs 92.3 \u00b1 2.9%, respectively (p=0.95). Corresponding 5-year overall survival (OS) rates are 98.2\u00b11.5% vs. 97.5\u00b11.7%, respectively (p=0.82). Results from the VCR/DEX pulse randomization remain blinded. Conclusion: Patients with average risk ALL, which accounts for a third of all children with ALL, have outstanding outcomes with 5-year DFS/OS rates of 95% and 98% with standard oral MTX dosing during maintenance therapy. Escalation of the MTX starting dose does not improve outcome. View large Download slide View large Download slide  Close modal Disclosures Zweidler-McKay: ImmunoGen: Employment.
