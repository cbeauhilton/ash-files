    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2902 Treatment of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with PDE4 inhibitors induces apoptosis while comparable treatment of primary human T and B cells from healthy donors does not. PDE4 inhibitor treatment also augments glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in CLL cells. We now report that PDE4 inhibitor treatment enhances CLL apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Using drug combination analysis, treatment with etoposide and rolipram resulted in a greater than additive apoptotic effect than predicted by a Loewe additivity model at many dose combinations. In order to directly address the role of DNA damage and rule out effects on drug uptake and efflux, we next examined the ability of PDE4 inhibitors to modulate gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis in CLL. While most patients demonstrated in vitro sensitivity to rolipram and gamma irradiation, a small subset of patients, including those known to be p53 mutant, that lacked a substantial response to ionizing radiation also lacked sensitivity to rolipram ( p < 0.01). Those patients with intact sensitivity to radiation, demonstrated at least an additive, or greater-than-additive at some doses, effect on apoptosis when PDE4 inhibitor treatment was combined with gamma irradiation treatment ( p < 0.05 at 1 Gy and 20 mM rolipram). As judged by comet assays, gamma radiation-induced DNA double stranded breaks were repaired within one hour of induction regardless of exposure to rolipram. As judged by Western analysis and flow cytometry, the kinetics of gamma irradiation-induced H2AX phosphorylation, a marker for DNA damage, were not altered by addition of rolipram in a manner that correlated with apoptosis. Finally, rolipram treatment did not further augment levels of p53, p21cip, or phospho-Chk2. These results suggest that PDE4 inhibitors did not alter double strand DNA break repair nor alter upstream radiation-induced p53-mediated signaling events. As PDE4 inhibitors are known to induce CLL apoptosis through a mitochondrial pathway, our current studies are focused on identifying the mechanism by which DNA damage and PDE4 inhibitor signaling pathways converge at the mitochondrion to enhance apoptosis. Regardless of the precise mechanism by which these supra-additive apoptotic effects occur, our study adds credence to the concept that PDE4 inhibitors may prove to be important sensitizing adjuvants in the treatment of human B cell malignancies.
