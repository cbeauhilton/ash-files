    "abstract_text": "We have previously reported that some classical Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (cHL) tissues display a gene signature evocative of a Th1 immune reaction. In order to better characterize this process, immune cell subsets were isolated from cHL tissue samples (n=21) using a powerful multicolor flow cytometry method, in parallel with cell sorting. Fresh tissue samples from follicular B cell lymphoma (FL, n=8), diffuse large cell B cell lymphoma (n=8) and reactive lymphadenitis (n= 5) were used as controls. In 4 cLH cases, we observed a significant proportion of activated CD8+ T-cells expressing ICOS and CXCR5 at high levels. The presence of either CD8+/ICOS+/CXCR5- T cells or CD8+/ICOS +/ CXCR5+ T-cells was a specific feature of HL tissues since it was absent from B-cell lymphomas, T-cell lymphomas and reactive tissues. In contrast, CD8+/CXCR5+ T-cells were found not only in cHL, but also in most other samples analyzed. Further phenotypic characterization showed that the CD8+/ICOS +/ CXCR5+ T cells expressed markers associated with CD4 TFH cells, like PD1, BTLA, bcl-6 and IL-21. Under stimulation, they expressed only low levels of IFNG, granzyme B and perforin, and thus do not fulfill the criteria of activated cytotoxic effectors. Co-culture experiments showed a dramatic enhancement of CD86 expression on stimulated B-cells in contact with CD8+/ICOS +/ CXCR5+ T cells. This effect was similarly observed after co-culture with CD4+TFH cells. The 4 cHL cases associated with CD8+/ICOS +/ CXCR5+ T-cells contained CD30+ CD15+ EBV+ Reed Sternberg cells (RSC). They were characterized a nodular non-sclerotic pattern reminiscent of the nodular lymphocyte-rich classical HL (NLRCHL) subtype, but also displayed a specific \u201cmixed nodularity\u201d feature. Various nodules were indeed observed, including reactive germinal centers (GC) partly colonized by RSC co-localizing with CD8+/ICOS+ T-cells, suggesting an early GC invasion triggering an intra-follicular CD8 T-cell reaction. Other nodules were composed of a high number of RS cells admixed with numerous CD8+/ICOS+ T-cells. This \u201cmixed nodularity\u201d pattern was absent in the other HL cases. Altogether, our results point out a previously unrecognized intra- follicular CD8 T-cell subset sharing phenotypic and functional features with CD4 TFH, that we have thus considered as putative \u201cfollicular cytotoxic\u201d CD8 T-cells (T FC ). This cell subset appears to be specifically associated with EBV+ cHL tissues with unusual histo-phenotypic features, which may probably reflect a strong CD8 activation process.
