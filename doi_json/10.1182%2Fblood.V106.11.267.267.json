    "abstract_text": "Canonical Notch signaling operates through a highly conserved pathway that regulates the differentiation and homeostasis of hematopoietic cells. Ligand-receptor binding initiates proteolytic release of the Notch intracellular domain (ICN) which migrates to the nucleus, binds the transcription factor CSL/RBPJk and activates target genes through the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators of the Mastermind-like family (MAML). Notch signaling is essential for the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during fetal life, but its effects on adult HSCs are controversial. In gain-of-function experiments, activation of Notch signaling in adult HSCs increased their self-renewal potential in vitro and in vivo . However, loss-of-function studies have provided conflicting results as to the role of physiological Notch signaling in HSC maintenance and homeostasis. To address this question, we expressed DNMAML1, a GFP-tagged pan-inhibitor of Notch signaling, in mouse HSCs. We have shown previously that DNMAML1 interferes with the formation of the ICN/CSL/MAML transcriptional activation complex and blocks signaling from all four Notch receptors (Notch1-4) (Maillard, Blood 2004). Transfer of DNMAML1-transduced bone marrow (BM) as compared to control GFP-transduced BM into lethally irradiated recipients gave rise to similar long-term stable expression of GFP for at least 6 months after transplant. DNMAML1 and GFP-transduced cells contributed equally to all hematopoietic lineages, except to the T cell and marginal zone B cell lineages, which are Notch-dependent. Expression of DNMAML1 did not affect the size of the BM progenitor compartment (Lin negative, Sca-1 positive, c-Kit high, or LSK cells), or the proportion of LSK cells that were negative for Flt3 and L-Selectin expression (containing long-term HSCs). The stem cell function of DNMAML1-transduced LSK cells was further assessed with in vivo competitive repopulation assays in lethally irradiated recipients. DNMAML1 and GFP-transduced LSK cells competed equally well with wild-type BM, as judged by their contribution to the myeloid lineage up to 4 months post-transplant, through two successive rounds of transplantation. Our data indicate that canonical Notch signaling is dispensable for the maintenance of stem cell function in adult HSCs."
