    "abstract_text": "In adult humans, T cells differentiate in the thymus and B cells develop in the bone marrow, but the site(s) of natural killer (NK) cell differentiation are unclear. Here we describe, for the first time, a unique CD34(+) population found in human lymph nodes (LN) that differentiates into NK cells. CD56 bright NK cells represent <10% of NK cells in peripheral blood (PB) yet predominate in LN where they can compete for endogenous T cell-derived IL-2 during immune activation due to their unique expression of functional high affinity (HA) interleukin (IL)-2 receptors (IL-2R). We hypothesized that a subset of CD34(+) hematopoietic precursor cells (HPC) might also express functional HA IL-2R and potentially differentiate into CD56 bright NK cells via activation with low dose IL-2. We first identified a novel human CD34 dim CD45RA(+) HPC in PB with constitutive expression of the HA IL-2R. When cultured in picomolar concentrations of IL-2 that selectively saturate the HA IL-2R, these cells give rise to CD56 bright NK cells, and this effect is blocked when IL-2 cannot bind to its HA receptor. This unique CD34(+) population expresses IL-2R\u03b1, CD2, CD7, c-kit, L-selectin, and NKR-P1A, all of which are also expressed by CD56 bright NK cells. Unique among total PB CD34(+) cells, this novel population displays high integrin \u03b1 4 \u03b2 7 expression. This attribute, in addition to its high L-selectin expression, suggested that these cells may traffic to LN where their progeny, CD56 bright NK cells, represent the major NK subset. Indeed we found a distinct CD34 dim CD45RA(+)\u03b1 4 \u03b2 7 bright population that resides in the T cell rich regions of human LN, and when stimulated in vitro with 10 pM IL-2, this cell gives rise to CD56 bright NK cells. This novel population represents only ~6% of all PB CD34(+) HPC yet is the major if not exclusive CD34(+) subset in LN. While murine studies strongly support the notion that most if not all NK cells require IL-15 for their development, these new human data suggest a model for development of a minor human NK subset, the CD56 bright NK cells, whereby CD34 dim CD45RA(+)\u03b1 4 \u03b2 7 bright HPC constitutively expressing the HA IL-2R traffic to peripheral LN where endogenous T cell-derived IL-2 can drive CD56 bright NK cell differentiation in vivo ."
