    "abstract_text": "Aim: To perform a systematic review of the efficacy of monotherapy with bortezomib versus thalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Methods: Published English literature from 1966 to June 2005 (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library), publication reference lists, Janssen-Cilag Pty Ltd data-on-file, and abstracts from recent multiple myeloma conferences were reviewed. Prospective studies containing at least a single arm of any treatment group with n \u2265 30 and using continuing or variable thalidomide dosing were included. Studies adding dexamethasone for non-responders were excluded. Outcomes were analysed on an intent-to-treat basis. Statistical pooling was performed where possible for the following outcome measures: primary outcome of response rate, defined by a serum M-protein reduction \u226550% (A) and strict (e.g. EBMT) criteria (B), and for the secondary outcomes of overall survival and progression-free survival. Results: One bortezomib (n=333, APEX, NEJM  2005 , 352 ; 2487 \u201398 ) and 15 thalidomide (n=1007) studies were included. Patient baseline characteristics including age, gender, IgG:IgA, disease duration and \u03b2 2 M were well matched, except that 48% of bortezomib patients had received prior thalidomide. On an intent-to-treat basis, the overall estimate for response rate (A) was 53% for patients receiving bortezomib versus 32% for thalidomide (p<0.001, n=10 studies). For response rate (B) the estimate was 36% for patients receiving bortezomib versus 22% for thalidomide (p<0.001, n=4 studies). One-year survival was 81% for patients receiving bortezomib versus 67% for thalidomide (p<0.001, n=6 studies). Due to differences in disease monitoring and definitions of progression, it was not possible to compare results for progression-free survival. Conclusion: In patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, bortezomib achieved significantly higher response rates and longer one-year survival than thalidomide, despite 48% of bortezomib-treated patients having received prior thalidomide."
