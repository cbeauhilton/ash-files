    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4396 Introduction The association between angiogenesis and cancer progression in solid tumors has been documented, but its significance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has not been completely evaluated. Vascular endothelial growth factor /VEGF/ is the major pro-angiogenic factor in humans and his transduction pathway may be very active in CLL cells contributes to their enhanced survival. In this context VEGF can be additional tool for predicting the clinical course in early CLL. Patients and Methods To predict the risk of disease progression, we analyzed serum levels VEGF (sVEGF) using ELISA tehnique in 33 Binet stage A de novo CLL patients. In addition, We analyzed microvessel density (MVD) of the same patients using immunohistochemical staining with CD34 and vWf. Finally, we explored wheather changes of circulating VEGF concentrations and MVD reflected clinico-biological features of CLL (peripheral blood lymphocytosis (PBL), bone marrow (BM) histology, beta-2 microglobulin (\u03b22m) level, lactat dehidrogenase (LDH) level) and kariotype abnormalities. Results The VEGF serum levels (sVEGF) was not significantly elevated (p=0.31) in CLL patients (mean: 70.9 pg/mL; range: 16\u2013483) compared with and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (mean: 44.7 pg/mL; range: 22\u201369.2). sVEGF level positively correlated with elevated LDH level (p=0.008), but no correlation with other clinico-biological features was found. Bone marrow MVD was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in CLL patients (mean: 35.91 vessels/field \u00b1 15.71) compared to controls (mean:8.27 vessels/field \u00b16.19). Also, there was a significant difference between MVD counts according to the antibody used. MVD was higher using CD34 vs vWF (CD34, 35.91 vessels/field \u00b115.7, vs vWF, 8.15 vessels/field \u00b14.65, p<0.0001). Bone marrow MVD detected by CD34 was significantlyhigher in patinents with CD38 expression more than 30% (p=0.006). However, no significant MVD differences were detected between CLL subgroups with regard to clinical course, pattern of marrow infiltration, Rai stage and FISH abnormalities. In univariate analysis sVEGF (p=0.018), Rai substages (p=0.027), PBL (p=0,030), \u03b22m level (p=0.008) and diffuse bone marrow infiltration (p=0.006) were significantly associated with increased risk of disease progression. But, in multivariate analysis only sVEGF (p=0.002) and \u03b22m level (p=0.008) retained their prognostic significance. Conclusions Serum VEGF level although not increased in comparasion with healthy controls, may improve the assessment of individual prognosis of patients with early CLL. Assessment of real clinical significance of bone marrow angiogenesis in CLL is required. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
