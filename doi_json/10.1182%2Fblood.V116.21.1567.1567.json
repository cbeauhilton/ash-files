    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1567 Microtubule-associated serine/threonine like kinase (MASTL kinase) was originally identified by genetic linkage as the probable mutant gene responsible for the platelet phenotype in a family with autosomal-dominant thrombocytopenia. MASTL kinase is the mammalian ortholog of Drosophila Greatwall kinase, which is required for cell cycle regulation. Affected members of the thrombocytopenic family carried a mutant MASTL kinase allele with a single nucleotide change that converted a glutamic acid codon to one specifying aspartic acid at amino acid 167 of the protein; no unaffected members of the family carried the mutant allele. Affected family members had a 60% reduction in the numbers of circulating platelets and megakaryocytes that were less mature and less polyploid than normal megakaryocytes. We have sought to determine how MASTL kinase affects platelet production and circulation by generating a strain of mice deficient in MASTL kinase. For this, we obtained embryonic stem (ES) cells containing a gene trap mutation within the murine Mastl gene from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center of the National Center for Research Resources (MMRRC, University of California, San Diego). The mutation was generated by an insertional disruption, and the resulting mutant allele carries a beta\u2013galactosidase/neomycin fusion expression cassette within the fourth intron of the Mastl kinase gene. Chimeric animals were bred and their offspring were genotyped by Southern blotting, confirming germ-line transmission. F1 heterozygote offspring were produced and appear developmentally normal and healthy, with platelet counts indistinguishable from those of their wild-type littermates. We have yet to observe a single weaned animal that is homozygous for the mutant allele in the F1 mice, indicating that MASTL kinase deficiency results in embryonic lethality. We observed decidual swellings at 13.5 days post coitus (dpc), which contained no traces of either embryos or yolk sac membranes. While this has made it impossible to genotype these malformed embryos, it does indicate that the embryos are viable to 3.5\u20135.5 dpc and are able to implant within the uterine horn. This unexpected phenotype demonstrates a significant and previously unknown role for Mastl kinase in embryonic development. We hypothesize that Mastl kinase may be involved in regulating cell differentiation during embryogenesis. In terms of role of MASTL kinase in familial thrombocytopenia, the mutant animals have allowed us to conclude that the thrombocytopenic syndrome is very unlikely to be the result of haploinsufficiency of MASTL kinase because heterozygous animals have normal platelet counts. Because of the dominant nature of the syndrome, this suggests that the mechanism involves either gain-of-function of the mutant allele or a dominant-negative inhibition of MASTL function specific to the megakaryocyte, two possibilities we are examining.
