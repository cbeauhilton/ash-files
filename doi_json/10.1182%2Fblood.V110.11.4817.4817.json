    "abstract_text": "Purpose: To compare efficacy and safety of BDbortezomib and dexamethasone in multiple myeloma as first-line, second-line or third-line treatment. Patients and methods: 18 patients(pts) treated with BD (bortezomig 1.3mg/m 2 on d 1,4,8,11 and dexamethasone 20mg on d 1\u20134 in a 21-day cycle). Responses were evaluated by the criteria of EBMT but a nCR was included. Adverse events were graded by the WHO criteria. Results: The median age was 52.5 years, and 13 (72.2%) were male. Ig subtypes were IgG, (8 pts, 44.4%), IgA (4 pts, 22.2%), light chain (2 pts, 11.1%), and IgD (1 pts, 5.9%). Durine/Salmon staging: IIA 5.9% (1/18), IIB 5.9% (1/18), IIIA 72.2% (13/18), IIIB16.6% (3/18). BD was administered in first-line (4 pts, 22.2%), second-line (7 pts 38.9%) and third-line (7 pts, 38.9%). The median number of BD cycles was 2.5 (range, 1\u20136 cycles). 17 pts could be evaluated, overall response was 88.3%, including CR in 2 pts (11.7%), nCR in 5 pts (29.4%), PR in 7 pts (41.2%), MR in 1 pts(5.9%), NC in 1 pts(5.9%), PD in 1 pts(5.9%). Pts in the first-line group received a response of 100%(4/4), including nCR in 1 pts (25.0%), PR in 2 pts (50.0%), MR in 1 pts(25.0%). The second-line group received a response of 100%(7/7), including CR in 1 pts(14.3%), nCR in 3 pts (42.9%), PR in 3 pts (42.9%). Those received BD as third-line or more got a response of 66.7% (4/6), including CR in 1 pts(16.7%), nCR in 1 pts (16.7%), PR in 2 pts (33.3%). Aderse events included diarrhea 44.4% (8/18; grade IV: 2/18), thrombocytopenia 44.4% (8/18; grade III\u2013IV: 7/18), fatigue 44.4% (8/18; grade IV: 1/18), peripheral neuropathy 33.3% (6/18, grade II:1/18), pyrexia 22.2%, infection 16.7% (3/18), headache 11.1%(2/18), parageusis 11.1%(2/18), hypotension 5.9%(1/18), hypoglycemia 5.9%(1/18) while combining with glipizide. The median time to minimum counts of platets was 14 days. The median time to most serious peripheral neuropathy appeared after treatment of 3 cycles. In 1 pts the therapy was disrupted by toxicity. Conclusion: BD demonstrated better response as first-line or second-line therapy than as third or more line therapy. Toxicities were torelated and manegable. There were no treatment related deaths.",
