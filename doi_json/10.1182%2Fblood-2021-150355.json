    "abstract_text": "DNTT encodes the most template-independent DNA polymerases TdT. The canonical function of TdT is to boost the diversity of immunoglobulin and T cell receptors by incorporating non-templated nucleotides (NTN) to their variable regions via RAG1/2 mediated DNA breaks and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) rearrangement process. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between aberrant DNTT expression and illegitimately TdT-aided microhomology-mediated replication-dependent recombination (MMRDR) with the mutagenesis of gene length mutations (LMs) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and their prognosis relevance. A cohort of 578 AML cases was enrolled. Fifty healthy donors for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), 393 B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cases, 78 T-ALL cases, and 25 mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) cases were used as control. Next-generation sequencing was performed for mutation analysis of 86 leukemia driver genes. RNA-seq was used to analyze the expression of DNTT and other non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) associated genes. Prognostic was investigated in a subset of 239 AML cases who underwent anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or anti-lymphocyte globulin (ALG) based regimen allo-HSCT. Based on sequence anatomy that considers the MMRDR mechanism and nucleotides characteristics of TdT mediated NTN incorporation, we formulate a classification algorithm for LMs and divide them into four subtypes (type I-IV). Type-I indicates pure duplicated/triplicated germline sequences with identifiable \u22652bp canonical triple microhomology (MH) sequences; type-II indicates pure duplicated/triplicated germline sequences without \u22652bp canonical MH sequences; type-III indicates any LMs with NTN insertions; type-IV indicates any other LMs, mainly deletions. FLT3 -LMs has the highest overall incidence and occur across multiple lineage leukemias. We observed a significant FLT3 -LMs subtypes distribution bias among acute leukemia subtypes (Figure 1A). Type-I FLT3 LMs are only observed in AML; there are mainly type-III FLT3 LMs in T-ALL and MPAL; type-II, III, IV FLT3 LMs are predominant in B-ALL. The overall DNTT expression was significantly lower in AML than in other leukemia subtypes and control groups (P < 0.001). This supports that FLT3 -LMs subtypes distribution bias might be attributed to the difference in the overall DNTT expression among leukemia lineages. A total of 458 LMs events were observed in 295 cases (51.0%) within 25 genes ( FLT3 , NPM1 , CEBPA , RUNX1 , KIT , etc.) in our AML cohort. The incidence of type-II and type-III LMs, both of which the mutagenesis relies on TdT-aided MMRDR in theoretically speculate, were 31.2 % and 47.8 %, respectively. Type-I and type-II, which manifested as pure germline sequence duplications, account for 43.6% of the FLT3 LMs; type-III LMs, which with additional inserted NTN sequences, account for as high as 50.4% of the FLT3 LMs. We analyzed the G/C nucleotide contents adjacent to LMs junctions. A significantly high G/C bias was observed at +1 nucleotide position in type-II and type-III subsets (Figure 1B), suggesting that the TdT-aided MMRDR mechanism plays a role in the mutagenesis in these cases. We also observed a strong positive correlation between fragment length and G/C content of the inserted NTN sequences (P < 0.001) within the type-III subset of the 25 LMs genes (Figure 1C), suggesting a higher TdT activity mediates longer inserted sequences. DNTT expressions level of type-III LMs cases were significantly higher than that of type-I, II, IV LMs cases and cases without LMs in the total 25 LMs genes (Figure 1D) and the FLT3 LMs subset. Similar expression signatures of other NHEJ associated genes RAG2 , XRCC4 , and XRCC6 were also observed. For the survival analysis in the ATG/ALG based regimen allo-HSCT AML subset, we observed a significantly better overall survival (P = 0.024) in cases positive for type-III FLT3 -LMs than that of type-I, II (Figure 1E). In this study, we proposed a subclassification algorithm for LMs (type I-IV) in AML. Both DNTT gene expression and sequence character suggesting that TdT-aided MMRDR plays a role in the mutagenesis of type-III and type-II LMs. We also observed AML cases with type-III FLT3 LMs benefit more from ATG/ALG based regimen allo-HSCT than cases with other FLT3 LMs types, which may be attributed to the aberrant lymphoid lineage antigen expression.
