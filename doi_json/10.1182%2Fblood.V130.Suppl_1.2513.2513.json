    "abstract_text": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the most common leukemia and characterized by the malignant growth of leukemic cells. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) has been shown to participate in the proliferation and progression of various cancers. However, the role of ADAR1 in AML has not yet been investigated. In this study, we compared the expression levels of ADAR1 between different status of AML patient samples and control group by qPCR and Western Blot analysis. We also investigated the functional role and possible mechanisms via silencing the ADAR1 expression of AML in vitro and in vivo. As a result, we found that the mRNA and protein levels of ADAR1 were significantly higher in the AML patients, while relatively lower in the control group. The ADAR1 mRNA expression was positively correlated with the ratio of leukemic cells. Additionally, silence of ADAR1 expression significantly suppressed the proliferation of AML cells and induced G1 arrest in cell cycle analysis. For mechanism analysis, the qPCR and western blot results revealed that ADAR1 knockdown resulted in the decreased expressions of Wingless-Int (Wnt) effectors including \u03b2-catenin, c-Myc, TCF4 and CCND2. In the nude mice model, inhibition of ADAR1 expression reduced the tumorigenic potential and reduced expressions of Wnt effectors.
