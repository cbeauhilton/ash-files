    "abstract_text": "Background Donor cell derived leukemia (DCL) is a rare event after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. First described in 1971, several cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS) arising from donor cells have been reported. The true incidence of DCL is difficult to ascertain, however the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation survey reported in 2005 an estimated rate of 124 cases per 100,000 transplants (Hernstein et al., Hematologica 2005;90:969-975). The aim of our study was to determine the incidence and natural history of DCL after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Methods We retrospectively reviewed patients that received an allo-HCT at MD Anderson from 1/1997 to 6/2012 for hematologic malignancy (n=2148) and chose to study two groups: (1) patients who had a sex mismatched allo-HCT for AML /MDS (n=433) and (2) those who received an allo-HCT for non-hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) (n=773) \u2013 subsequently these cases were reviewed for a diagnosis of AML/MDS post transplant. Donor origin of leukemic cells was confirmed by presence of donor specific sex chromosomes on conventional cytogenetic analysis or FISH studies and by donor specific microsatellite polymorphic markers on DNA analysis (chimerism studies). Demographic and disease-related data are presented in table 1 .  Primary dx . Time to DCL (mo) . Age at transplant . Sex of recipient vs donor Related (y/n) . Initial cytogenetics .

Median age at transplant was 59 years (range 25-66 years) and median time to diagnosis of DCL was 19 months (range 4-103 months). Only 1 patient was actively treated for GVHD with corticosteroids at diagnosis of DCL. Four of 9 had monosomy 7, 1 of 9 had trisomy 8 while the remainder of patients had diploid cytogenetics. The outcome of DCL was poor with a median survival from diagnosis of 5 months (range 1-89 months). Conclusions Our analysis suggests that DCL occurs in no less than 0.7% of patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplants for AML/MDS or NHL. While the mechanism of leukemogenesis is unclear, monosomy 7 was demonstrated in 45% of these cases. Although the number of cases analyzed is low, the overall prognosis for DCL seems poor.
