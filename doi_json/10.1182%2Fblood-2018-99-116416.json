    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare intracranial lymphoma that accounts for less than 1% of all non-Hodgkins lymphomas and 3% of all brain tumors. Histopathologically, approximately 90% of PCNSL cases are categorized as a diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL malignancies are subdivided by Cell of Origin (COO), with the vast majority of PCNSL categorized as non-germinal center B cell (non-GCB) by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression profiling (GEP), however, has shown that immunohistochemically defined non-GCB resolves into two distinct subtypes, namely activated B-cell (ABC) and unclassified (UNC) subtypes. Using the Lymph2Cx molecular COO subtyping assay, we have found that 91% of PCNSL are ABC (unpublished data). Unlike systemic-DLBCL, PCNSL is largely confined to and rarely metastasizes outside of the immune privileged central nervous system. Despite this, PCNSL is one of the most aggressive forms of DLBCL. Given the immune privileged milieu in which PCNSL arises, we hypothesized that this milieu elicits a transcriptional profile that contributes to the enhanced aggressive nature of PCNSL compared to systemic-DLBCL. To investigate this hypothesis, this study assessed the gene expression differences between ABC-PCNSL and ABC-systemic-DLBCL, in order to identify novel players in the pathogenesis of ABC-PCNSL. Methods: A total of 35 HIV negative samples, with proven ABC-subtype COO as per the GEP Lymph2Cx assay, were employed; including 10 ABC systemic-DLBCL and 25 primary ABC PCNSL cases with no concurrent or prior history of systemic DLBCL. Samples were reviewed by a hematopathologist to confirm diagnoses and determine tumor content. Samples with <60% tumor content were macro-dissected before nucleic acid extraction, which was performed using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE Kit. Extracted DNA and RNA were quantified using the Qubit HS-kit and NanoDrop respectively. Digital gene expression technology was used to perform the PanCancer Pathways panel (NanoString, Seattle, WA). Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the NanoString specific statistical method NanoStringDiff. Identified gene sets were analyzed using the online Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Results: Of the 739 cancer related genes targeted by the PanCancer panel, 256 were found to be significantly differentially expressed in the ABC-PCNSL cohort compared to the ABC-DLBCL cohort (p<0.05). Fifty six genes were upregulated and 200 were downregulated. With a 4.9 fold change, the most significantly overexpressed gene was FGF1 (p=4.7E-11). FGF1 encodes a primary ligand for the fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) -1, -2, -3 and -4; of which, FGFR2 (p=1.0E-7) and FGFR3 (p=0.003) were also significantly overexpressed. Moreover, MSigDB identified the FGF signaling pathway as enriched in the upregulated gene set (5 genes, p=7.4E-9, FDR=6.6E-7). FGFRs are a family of receptors that activate known mitogenic signaling pathways including MAPK signaling, which MSigDB identified as the most enriched pathway in the upregulated gene set (14 genes, p=1.65E-19, FDR=2.2E-16). MSigDB analysis of the 200 down regulated genes revealed that 5 of the top 20 enriched signaling pathways were immune related and included Signaling by interleukins (26 genes, p=2.9E-38, FDR=3.2E-36), Immune cytokine signaling (31 genes, p=1.1 E-34, FDR=1.1E-32), chemokine signaling (28 genes, p=1.5E-34, FDR=1.4E-32), T-cell receptor signaling (24 genes, p=2.4E-34, FDR=1.9E-32) and Toll-like receptor signaling (23 genes, p=4.1E-33, FDR=3.0E-31). Conclusions: We show, for the first time, that ABC-PCNSL and ABC-systemic-DLBCL possess significantly different transcriptional profiles despite identical, molecularly determined, COO status. A principle difference between these DLBCL malignancies is their anatomical location related immune privilege status which is reflected as reduced immune related signaling in the CNS-DLBCL cohort and may have important mitogenic signaling implications. Indeed, the results suggest that the enhanced aggressive nature of PCNSL compared to systemic-DLBCL is mediated, at least in part, by enhanced FGF signaling; a pathway with known roles in cell survival and proliferation.
