    "abstract_text": "Abstract 840 T-cells are an essential component of immune mediated tumor rejection. Adoptive transfer of T-cells results in a durable anti-tumor response in some patients with hematological malignancies. To further improve the efficacy of T-cell adoptive transfers, a better understanding of the regulatory checkpoints of these cells is needed. Here we show that HDAC11 is a negative regulator of CD8+ T-cell function, thus representing a potential target in adoptive immunotherapy. HDACs are a group of enzymes initially known for their role in deacetylating histones, thereby condensing chromatin structure and repressing gene expression. The known roles of HDACs as epigenetic regulators have recently expanded to include more complex regulatory functions including interactions with non-histone targets. HDAC11 is the most recently identified member of the HDAC family, and is highly expressed in brain, testis and T-cells. Recently, our group reported HDAC11 as a regulator of IL-10 production in antigen presenting cells. To determine the role of HDAC11 in T-cell biology, T-cells from HDAC11 knock out (HDAC11KO) mice were compared to wild-type T-cells in number, function and phenotype. HDAC11KO T-cells had no differences in absolute number or percentages of CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes. However CD8+ T-cells were hyper-proliferative upon CD3/CD28 stimulation and produced significantly higher levels of the pro-inflammatory, Tc1 cytokines IL-2, INF-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1. However, no significant increases in the production of the Tc2 cytokines IL-4, IL-6 or IL-10 were seen. Further investigation of phenotypic differences also revealed that HDAC11KO mice have a larger percentage of central memory CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, HDAC11KO CD8+ T-cells express higher levels of the transcription factor Eomes, a known contributor to central memory cell formation as well as a controller of granzyme B and perforin production in CD8+ T-cells. This Tc1 and central memory-like phenotype translated to delayed tumor progression and survival in vivo in C1498 AML bearing mice treated with adoptively transferred HDAC11KO T-cells, as compared with wild type T-cells. Collectively, we have demonstrated HDAC11 as a negative regulator of CD8+ T-cell function, and a novel potential target to augment the efficacy of adoptive T-cell tumor immunotherapy.
