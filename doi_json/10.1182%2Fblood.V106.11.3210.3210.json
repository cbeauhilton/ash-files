    "abstract_text": "Due to a founder affect certain regions of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador have a very high prevalence of mild Hemophilia A. To accurately plan for future health related needs of these patients, a base-line cross-sectional study of a large cohort segregating a known founder mutation (Val2016Ala) was undertaken.

Gait (R -.45, p30) had significantly greater impairment in their Range of Motion than non-obese males (4.59 vs (3.34), p<0.05) independent of whether or not they had hemophilia. These results are consistent with our clinical experience that mild Hemophilia A causes episodic bleeding, lack of recognition and delayed treatment leads to significant morbidity. The association with diabetes was unexpected. Future interventions will now focus on prevention and early treatment of ankle bleeds and will include strategies to reduce the risk of obesity.",
