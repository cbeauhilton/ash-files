    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3905 Background: Apoptosis resistance of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells is mediated by several pro-survival stimuli. In particular, engagement of the B-cell receptor (BCR), CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40L) interaction or stimulation by interleukin-(IL)-4 were identified as major factors to regulate chemoresistance. Sphingolipids are known to be involved in several metabolic pathways involved in chemoresitance. Therefore, we focused on ceramide as pro-apoptotic molecule and its counterpart glucosylceramide, which rather contributes to proliferation and survival. Methods and Results: Applying liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, we revealed a significant decrease of pro-apoptotic ceramide in BCR/IL-4/CD40L-stimulated primary CLL cells compared to untreated controls (p=0.0258, p=0.0478, p=0.0114). Anti-apoptotic glucosylceramide levels were significantly increased after BCR cross-linking (p=0.0435) while other stimuli caused no relevant change in glucosylceramide expression. We identified BCR engagement to catalyze the crucial modification of ceramide to glucosylceramide via the enzyme UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG) (p=0.0001). Besides specific UGCG inhibitors, we could show for the first time that IgM-mediated UGCG expression was significantly inhibited by the novel and highly effective PI3K\u03b4 and BTK inhibitors CAL-101 and PCI-32765, which were able to revert IgM-induced apoptosis resistance of CLL cells. Recently published data revealed sphingolipids to be essential for mediation of apoptosis via mitochondria. Therefore, we chose ABT-737 \u2013 a well-known and also mitochondria-targeting drug \u2013 as candidate partner for PI3K\u03b4 and BTK inhibition. When combining each tyrosine kinase inhibitor with ABT-737, a synergistic apoptotic effect could be documented, even under protection by BCR stimulation. Conclusion: In summary, we could demonstrate that sphingolipids are critically involved in CLL pathogenesis. UGCG could be identified as drugable target by the novel kinase inhibitors CAL-101 and PCI-32765 resulting in even synergistic apoptosis following additional application of ABT-737. Sphingolipids seem to offer further targets providing novel treatment options in CLL. C.M.W. and L.P.F. contributed equally to this work. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
