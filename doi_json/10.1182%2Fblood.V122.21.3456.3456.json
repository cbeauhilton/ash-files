    "abstract_text": "Introduction Pulmonary hypertension is one of the major complications in patients with thalassemia. The prevalence is higher among patients with non - transfusion dependent thalassemia (NTDT) than those patients with thalassemia major. Patients with NTDT have distinct genetic subgroups. Therefore, the effects of different genotype groups on pulmonary hypertension in patients with NTDT were assessed. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in patients with NTDT aged \u2265 10 years old at Srinagarind University Hospital and Udonthani Hospital. Pulmonary hypertension was defined as a tricuspid regurgitation velocity > 2.9 m/s by trans-thoracic echocardiography. All patients gave consent and the protocol was approved by the Ethics committee of Faculty of Medicine, KhonKaen University and Udonthani Hospital. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data that literature indicated as risk factors for pulmonary hypertension were collected. Genotypes were determined by hemoglobin typing and DNA analysis. The effect of genotype group on pulmonary hypertension was evaluated by using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results Two hundred twenty two patients were recruited, 3 patients were excluded (1 patient with congenital heart disease and 2 patients with valvular heart disease). In a total of 219 patients, pulmonary hypertension was found in 24 patients (10.96%). All patients were categorized into 2 groups according to genetic data that included: 1) \u03b2-thalassemia (140, 63.93%) 2) \u03b1-thalassemia and combined \u03b1 and \u03b2-thalassemia (79, 36.07%).Genotype groups were statistically and significantly associated with pulmonary hypertension based on the adjusted odds ratios after adjustment for other factors. Patients with \u03b2-thalassemia had a statistically significant higher risk for pulmonary hypertension compared to patients with \u03b1-thalassemia and patients with combined \u03b1 and \u03b2-thalassemia had an odds ratio of 9.47 (p=0.036). Conclusion Genotype group is an independent risk factor for pulmonary hypertension in patients with NTDT. Echocardiography should be routinely recommended in patients with \u03b2-thalassemia. In patients with \u03b1-thalassemia and combined \u03b1 and \u03b2-thalassemia, pulmonary hypertension is uncommon. Therefore, echocardiography should be only performed when these patients have a clinical indication.
