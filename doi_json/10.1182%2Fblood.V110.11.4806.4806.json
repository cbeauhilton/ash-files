    "abstract_text": "Backround: Dysregulation of the PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway has been implicated in the development of a number of malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM). This cellular signaling mechanism and its downstream targets (eg mTOR) regulate cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis. SF1126 (Semafore) is a water soluble prodrug of the pan-PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, whose anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity has been well described in the literature. Preclinical studies using SF1126 in a variety of malignancies including glioma, prostate, non-small cell lung cancer, and breast cancer appear promising and have demonstrated profound antiangiogenic effects mediated through VEGF inhibition. Aim : To demonstrate in vitro anti-myeloma activity of SF1126, alone and in combination with dexamethasone, bortezomib, and melphalan and evaluate their effects on downstream targets of PI3K/Akt. Methods: MM cell lines (MM.1R, MM.1S, RPMI 8226) were treated with SF1126 (1\u2013100uM), dexamethasone (5uM), bortezomib (5nM), melphalan (10uM) alone, and in combination. Growth inhibition following treatment was measured by MTT assay at 24 and 48 hours. Apoptosis was assessed by annexin-V binding assay using flow cytometry. Immunoblot analysis was performed to measure downstream targets of Akt including: p-PDK1 and mTOR (4E-BP1). Results: A clear dose response was established with an IC50 of 8.75uM in the MM.1R and 7.5uM in the MM.1S cell lines at 48 hours. At 24 and 48 hours, 5uM SF1126 alone resulted in 80% and 64% cell viability by MTT assay, respectively, in the MM.1R cell line. The combination of 5uM SF1126 with conventional agents was then tested in the MM.1R cell line. Combination with 5uM dexamethasone enhanced the efficacy of 5uM SF1126 by 26% at 48 hours. Combination with 10uM melphalan enhanced the efficacy of 5uM SF1126 by 20% at 24 hours. The combination with 5nM bortezomib enhanced the efficacy of 5uM SF1126 by 23% at 48 hours. Given prior experience demonstrating that short exposure to bortezomib activates Akt, we tested sequential administration of bortezomib and SF1126 in the MM.1R cell line. Optimal cell death was induced with bortezomib prior to SF1126, followed by concurrent administration. Immunoblot analysis of p-PDK1, downstream mTOR target (4E-BP1) were performed on the MM.1S cell line treated with 5, 10, 20, and 50uM SF1126 at 12 and 24 hours. At the 12 hour time point, p-PDK-1 appeared to increase, but was significantly reduced by 48 hours. A similar pattern of initial upregulation followed by reduction by 24 hours was seen with the mTOR protein 4E-BP1. Conclusion: SF1126 has dose dependent, in vitro activity in several multiple myeloma cell lines both as a single agent and in combination with dexamethasone, bortezomib, and melphalan. The addition of SF1126 to dexamethasone in a dexamethasone resistant cell line results in increased cell death, possibly by overcoming resistance mechanisms. The addition of SF1126 to bortezomib and melphalan also resulted in increased growth inhibition over either agent alone. These results warrant further study of this promising new pan-PI3K/Akt inhibitor."
