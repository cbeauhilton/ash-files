    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5006 In AL amyloidosis typical sites of amyloid buildup are heart, skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidneys, and blood vessels. To evaluate the heart involvement in systemic and localized amyloidosis proBNP, peptide (NT-proBNP; 76 amino acids) and MPC-1 were investigated. NT-proBNP have been described as useful marker for the diagnosis heart disease, and its plasma concentrations correlate with the functional classification of patients according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA). MCP-1 is a chemokine that activates mononuclear phagocytes by promoting leukocyte\u2013endothelium binding and migration to sites of inflammation. The MCP-1 levels seem to be related to the severity of cardiac alteration, as demonstrated by the coronary angiogram. NT-proBNP and MPC-1 serum levels were performed in systemic or localized AL amyloidosis to evaluate if there was a difference in the heart involvement. Blood samples were collected from 8 patients with systemic amyloidosis and from 4 patients with localized amyloidosis. To analyze the results of NT-proBNP and MPC-1, Mann-Whitney test was performed. NT-proBNP serum values were significantly ( p = 0.007 ) increased in systemic disease. Also, MPC-1 serum levels were significantly ( p = 0.004 ) higher in the patients with systemic disease (350.52\u00b158.70 pg/ml) if compared to the group of localized amyloidosis (147.82\u00b126.03 pg/ml). On the basis of our results, the heart seem to be functionally more involved in AL systemic amyloidosis than in localized disease, as demonstrated by the higher NT-proBNP and MPC-1 serum values.
