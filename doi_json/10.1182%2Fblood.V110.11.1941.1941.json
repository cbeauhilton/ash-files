    "abstract_text": "Background: Second generation TKI have shown preclinical activity against most imatinib resistant BCR-ABL KD mutations with the exception of T315I. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated across all phases of CML after imatinib failure. Study Aims: We investigated whether in vitro sensitivity of KD mutation correlates with outcome of pts receiving 2 nd generation TKI. Study Groups: We analyzed 169 pts with imatinib failure, who were treated with 2 nd generation TKI, for detection of mutations in the entire KD of BCR-ABL. Median age was 50 years (yr) (11\u201396). They received imatinib for a median of 30 months (mo) (2\u201370) and were followed for a median of 23 mo (3\u201338) from the start of therapy with 2 nd generation TKI. Results: After imatinib failure, 81 pts (40 CP, 24 AP, 17 BP) received dasatinib (D) and 88 pts (19 CP, 47 AP, 22 BP) received nilotinib (N). KD mutations were detected prior to TKI switch in 42 pts (52%) treated with D and 45 pts (51%) treated with N. The IC 50 values for each drug for in vitro kinase inhibition for each mutation ( O\u2019Hare, Can Res  2005 ; 65 : 4500 ) was used to classify mutations into high sensitive (54), intermediate sensitive (24), and low sensitive (9) to D [IC 50 values1000 nM (5)] ( Hochhaus, JCO  2007 ; 25 : 362s ) and N [IC 50 values2000 nM (4)]. In 59 CP pts (40 D, 19 N), response was simlar for 31 pts with and 28 without baseline mutation: CHR 77% vs 96% (p=0.054); MCyR 58% vs 68% (p=0.61), CCyR 52% vs 50% (p=0.9), respectively. The 2-yr EFS for pts with and without mutations were 63% and 72%, respectively (p=0.4). Outcome correlated with the mutation IC 50 (Table 1). Among 71 AP pts (24 D, 47 N), response was similar for 41 pts with and 30 without baseline mutation: CHR 68% vs 70% (p=0.87); MCyR 63% vs 60% (p=0.96); CCyR 54% vs 47% (p=0.73), respectively. The 2-yr EFS for pts with and without mutation were 33% and 40%, respectively (p=0.41). As in CP, there was a trend for worse outcome for AP pts with intermediate sensitivity mutations (Table 1). In 39 BP pts (17 D, 22 N), response was not different between 15 pts with and 24 pts without baseline mutation: CHR was achieved in 27% vs 42% (p=0.49); MCyR in 20% vs 25% (p=0.9) being CCyR in 13% vs 25% (p=0.45). The 2-yr EFS for pts with and without mutations were 33% vs 29%, respectively (p=0.96). Conclusions: 2 nd generation TKI are capable of inducing hematologic and cyogenetic responses in a significant proportion of imatinib resistant pts across all phases. Outcome depends on the type of mutation, with mutations with predicted intermediate levels of sensitivity having decreased probability of response and EFS, particularly in CP. The correlation with IC 50 is less evident in advanced phases suggesting more complex mechanisms of resistance. Table 1.  . . . percent . 2-year (%) . Phase . IC50 . N . MCyR . CCyR . EFS . OS .
