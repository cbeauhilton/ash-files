    "abstract_text": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life threatening disorder characterised by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia associated with a deficiency in ADAMTS 13. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains an important infectious cause of TTP. We report the characteristics and treatment of patients presenting over a 6.5 year period to a tertiary referral centre. Cases: 9 patients, 8 female, 1 male, all heterosexual Africans. In 5 of the patients, TTP presentation was associated with the initial diagnosis of HIV. Only 1 patient was on highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at diagnosis. Median haemoglobin on admission was 6.4 (range 4.6\u20137.2) g/dl, platelet count-12 (range 5\u201353) X 10 9 /L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1401 (range 914-2532) IU/L. In 6 patients there were neurological features at presentation, from headache, to transient ischaemic attacks and coma;6 patients had renal impairment, median creatinine 127 (range 63\u2013418) \u03bcmol/L. Notably, HIV associated TTP was not a late onset disorder associated with poor CD 4 counts and poor prognosis. Median CD 4 counts were 170 (range 70\u2013400) cells/\u03bcl, with a median viral load 74,400 copies/ml. ADAMTS 13 activity ranged from  (PEX) with cryosupernatant, median 8 (range 3-16) until remission and started HAART as soon as the diagnosis was made. Two patients received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) replacement for PEX for refractory TTP: one had coma and suboptimal treatment pre-referral, the second patient had an initial speedy recovery, but developed septicaemia. Two patients stopped their anti-retroviral therapy and had a TTP relapse within 3 months. However, recommencement of HAART plus 3 and 6 PEX\u2019s respectively was associated with remission. Six of the patients remain in remission from TTP at 6\u201374 months; 2 were lost to follow-up and 1 died 18 months later from renal failure, unrelated to TTP. These data suggest HIV status should be checked in all patients presenting with acute TTP as it accounted for 12.5% of all acute TTP admissions in our cohort. All HIV associated TTP patients were black African heterosexuals. Treatment with PEX and HAART was associated with speedy remission of TTP. In patients who stopped HAART, TTP relapsed within 3 months. The abscence of antibody to ADAMTS 13 suggests a possible direct effect of the retrovirus on endothelium. With HAART and a decrease in viral load, ADAMTS 13 activity increases as patients achieve remission.",
