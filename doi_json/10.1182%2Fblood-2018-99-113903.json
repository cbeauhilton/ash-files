    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Mutations in KLF1 (Kruppel Like Factor1) have been noted to cause a number of different phenotypes of erythrocyte abnormalities, as KLF1 is known as a master regulator of many genes expressed in red blood cells. One important manifestation caused by KLF1 mutations is the upregulation of \u03b3- or \u03b4-globin genes, with associated microcytosis, thus mimicking beta thalassemia (\u03b2-thal) trait. Such findings cause difficulty in counseling couples referred for prenatal diagnosis of \u03b2-thal. KLF1 mutations have been reported to be more frequent in geographic regions where \u03b2-thal is common. Therefore we undertook to analyze for the presence of KLF1 mutations in Israeli individuals. Materials and Methods: We selected 100 individuals for analysis belonging to one of 4 different groups: 1. Individuals with isolated elevated HbA2 (n=14), or isolated elevation of HbF (n=13) or elevation of both HbA2 and HbF (n=6), who are not carriers of a \u03b2-thal mutation by sequence analysis. 2. Individuals with \u03b2-thal trait (n=19) who have a higher HbF (and/or HbA2) than is expected for \u03b2-thal trait, who do not have \u03b2-thal intermedia on clinical criteria (blood count, peripheral smear, spleen size). These individuals carried one of 8 mutations known to cause \u03b2-thal in our region 3. Two patients (pts) with a history of transfusions (one with massive splenomegaly and sickle trait, suspected to have coinherited CDA, and one with \u03b2-thal intermedia with HbF elevation unexpectedly high for his mutation (TATA box -28 A to C; HBB:c.-78A>C). This patient had HbF levels ranging from 23-33% and HbA2 ranging from 7.8-8.9% over years of followup from age 39-50 years. 4. Anonymous controls (n=46) who are pts with a hematological malignancy not suspected of carrying a hemoglobinopathy. KLF1 (exons 1, 2 and 3) was amplified using PCR (exon 1: 564 base pair product and exons 2 and 3: 1703 base pair product). PCR products were subjected to DNA sequence analysis using an Applied Biosystems ABI apparatus. The sequence obtained was analyzed using BLAST alignment and deviations from the published sequence were analyzed using the Mutation Taster program. Results: Two pts were found to carry substitutions with possible or proven clinical significance. One pt is heterozygous for a substitution at c.972C>A (codon 324 exon 3, E324D, aspartic acid to glutamine) which has not been previously reported. According to Mutation Taster this substitution may have clinical significance. This pt, who has normal hematological parameters, had isolated HbA2 elevation (4.1%) with no \u03b2-thal mutation identified. The second pt was found to be heterozygous for a substitution at c.901C>T (codon 301 exon 2, R301C, arginine to cysteine). This substitution has been reported by Gallienne et al, 2012, to be associated with elevated Hb F. This young pt was found to have 28% Hb F with a low HbA2 level of 1.4% and MCV of 63.8. His father also had 28% HbF. No \u03b2-thal mutation was identified in the pt or his father but the patient was found to be homozygous for a single alpha globin gene deletion. In addition to these 2 substitutions, many pts and controls carried known polymorphisms in KLF1. These polymorphisms are: c.304T>C, exon 2 residue 102 (S102P) (found in 24 pts and 19 controls); -148(G>A), in the upstream noncoding region (found in 11 pts and 8 controls); c.544T>C codon 182 exon 2 (F182L) (found in 3 pts and 4 controls); and c.115A>C, codon 39 in exon 2, M39L (found in 1 pt and 3 controls). One rare, previously unreported substitution was found in heterozygous form in the thal intermedia pt, located at c.259C>G codon 87 exon 2, P87A (proline to alanine). This was not found in the controls, however according to the location in the gene, and to Mutation Taster, this is not suspected to be a functional variant. Conclusions: Functional variants in KLF1 were rarely found in this group of patients. One out of 14 (7%) of individuals with isolated elevated HbA2 and 1/13 patients with isolated HbF elevation (7.7%) were identified as carrying heterozygous KLF1 functional variants. Two novel substitutions were found: E324D which is suspected to have clinical significance and P87A which is not presently suspected to be a functional variant. We conclude that KLF1 analysis may explain occasional individuals with high HbA2, or marked HbF elevation, in the absence of \u03b2-thal trait in our patient population. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
