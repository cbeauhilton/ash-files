    "abstract_text": "Background The salvage therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia still poses a highly unmet clinical need. Given the established activity and toxicity profiles of hypomethylating agents such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine, DAC) in patients with untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we explored the therapeutic effects of dose adjusted DAC in patients with relapsed / refractory AML, and compared treatment outcome with the conventional FLAG regimen. Patients and Methods 27 patients with relapsed/refractory AML were included in this analysis. Twelve patients were treated with DAC 20 mg/m 2 per day as 1-hour intravenous infusion for consecutive five days, with additional \u00a01-3 doses of DAC added based on response and tolerability (Table 1). Another group of 15 patients received a course of FLAG regimen as controls. Table 1 Adjustment for dose of DAC for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia  Characteristics Dose added Cellularity 0 normal 1 increased 0 BM Blast % 1 No 2 <5% 0 \u00ae5% -1 General condition -1 Karnofsky performance score\u00ae80 0 Karnofsky performance score<80  Age  \u00ae60  <60  Characteristics Dose added Cellularity 0 normal 1 increased 0 BM Blast % 1 No 2 <5% 0 \u00ae5% -1 General condition -1 Karnofsky performance score\u00ae80 0 Karnofsky performance score<80  Age  \u00ae60  <60  View Large Results Although the overall response rates (ORR) were similar in DAC group (5/12) and FLAG group (9/15)\u00a3\u00a841.7 % versus 60 %, P=0.449 \u00a3\u00a9, the complete remission (CR) rate plus CRi was lower in DAC group (2/12) than in FLAG group(10/15)\u00a3\u00a816.7 %versus 66.7 %, P=0.047 \u00a3\u00a9. Induction mortality was 0 (0% at 8 weeks) and toxicities were manageable in both groups. Toxicities were predominantly hematologic. The most common drug-related adverse events (AEs\u00a3\u00a9 were grade 4 myelosuppression which were comparable for DAC and FLAG., DAC group hadfewer infections\u00a3\u00a8DAC, 6/12\u00a3\u00bbFLAG\u00a3\u20acn=14/15, P=0.024 \u00a3\u00a9. The 2-year survival rate was similar in the two groups: 25.0% in the DAC versus 26.7% in the FLAG group\u00a3\u00a8 P=0.574 \u00a3\u00a9, while median survival times of the two groups were 4 and 12 months, respectively. Conclusion Dose-adjusted DAC achieved similar overall response rate with lower infection risk compared to FLAG regimen in patients with relapsed / refractory AML.
