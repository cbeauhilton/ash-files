    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids are still a cornerstone in multiple myeloma (MM) therapy, both as a single agent and as a part of many protocols, including VAD regimen (vincristine, adriblastine, dexamethasone). Corticosteroids are known to be involved in blood pressure (BP) regulation and to affect this parameter. The impact of dexamethasone (Dex) administration on BP in MM patients during VAD protocol treatment is poorly documented. AIM: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the blood pressure changes during Dex administration in patients treated with VAD protocol due to MM. METHODS: Thirteen patients with MM (7 men and 6 women; mean age 62,45 \u00b1 8,14) were assessed. Primary hypertensive patients (7 persons) were not excluded. They were administered Dex in standard dose of 40 mg (day 1\u20134, 9\u201312, 17\u201321) according to VAD protocol. Blood pressure was assessed by the use of commercially available instruments of Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM). The BP recordings lasted 48 hours, were started on the day before the first day of VAD and were obtained every 10 minutes during mornings, every 15 minutes during the rest of days and every 20 minutes during nights. Average of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) were estimated for the 2-hour time before Dex and for the 14-hour time in the 2-hour periods after Dex. Minimal and maximal range of SBP/DBP increase and the mean amount of SBP/DBP increase were also determined. RESULTS: 48-hour BP recordings revealed a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after Dex administration in all patients. SBP and DBP began to increase after 3 hours after Dex, then rose continually and reached the peak in the period from 6 to 10 hour after Dex. In comparison to 2-hour period before Dex, in which SBP/DBP amounted 139,63/82,92 \u00b1 23,47/9,38 mmHg, the mean SBP/DBP increase rate was: in the 2\u20134 hour period after Dex - 146,68/88,15 \u00b1 24,38/10,51 mmHg (p<0,05), in the 6\u20138 \u2013 148,07/92,66 \u00b1 14,07/9,04 mmHg (ns), in the 8\u201310 \u2013 147,8/87,99 \u00b1 14,07/9,04 mmHg (p<0,01), in the 10\u201312 \u2013 143,44/86,12 \u00b1 17,22/9,77 mmHg (p<0,05) and in the 12\u201314 \u2013 144,47/88,59 \u00b1 17,04/12,54 mmHg (p<0,01). The minimal range of SBP/DBP increase was 10,50/\u22122,00 mmHg, maximal range of SBP/DBP increase was 35,43/40,00 mmHg and the mean amount of SBP/DBP increase was 20,06/11,6 \u00b1 8,36/14,23 mmHg. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary study revealed that Dex administration causes an increase in BP in all patients. The mean increase in BP amounted 20,06/11,6 \u00b1 8,36/14,23 mmHg and was similar in all patients, regardless their initial value of BP. So our study demonstrates the need of individualized hypertension treatment with strict control of BP in hypertensive patients when corticosteroid therapy is indicated.",
