    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3107 Poster Board III-44 Prior studies have demonstrated that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) regulates proliferation and differentiation of normal hematopoietic progenitors. HGF activity occurs primarily via interactions with the c-met receptor, a tyrosine kinase receptor found on epithelial and some cancer cells. In solid tumors, HGF/c-met interactions mediate increased neoplastic invasion, metastases, and angiogenesis. However, in vitro, HGF has also been shown to mediate anti-tumor effects in leukemia cell line models. To better elucidate the role of HGF in acute leukemogenesis, we evaluated HGF and c-met gene expression in 91 normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (NK-AML) patient samples previously characterized for marrow angiogenesis (CD31+ microvessels), FLT-3/NPM-1 gene mutation, and pro-angiogenic factors and receptors (specifically vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF-A and C) and their receptors). Median patient age was 66 years (range 21-87) with 49 women and 42 men. AML disease FAB subtypes M2 (37%) and M1 (36%) subtypes were most common. Median presenting white blood cell count (WBC) was 32,000/\u03bcL (range 0.43-555,000/\u03bcL) with marrow blasts of 70.6% (range 15-95.4%). Fourteen percent presented with extramedullary disease. Median OS was 9.4 months (95% CI 6.7 to 11.5 months), with median EFS of 8 months (95% CI 5.7 to 11.5 months) for all patients. Seventy-nine patients received cytarabine and anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy with 58% (n=46) achieving complete remission (CR). Marrow aspirate samples were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with levels expressed relative to normal bone marrow controls (set =1). We found that HGF gene expression was upregulated in most primary NK-AML patient samples, with 88% expressing higher HGF than normal bone marrow. Median HGF expression in AML samples was 7.73 fold higher than normal controls. Multivariate analysis including age, complete remission, marrow blasts, extramedullary disease, and expression of other angiogenic factors and receptors as covariables, showed high HGF expression to be significantly associated with both longer overall and event-free survival. Surprisingly, HGF gene expression was found to be negatively correlated with microvessel density and NPM-1 mutation and positively correlated with the VEGF receptor neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) which has been reported to function as co-mediator of HGF activity. No association between HGF and FLT-3 ITD mutation was noted. The majority of AML samples did not express the HGF receptor, c-met, suggesting that HGF function in AML occurs primarily via paracrine interactions with surrounding vascular and stromal cells and/or HGF/NRP-1 autocrine pathways. Further analysis confirmed no significant correlation between HGF and c-met gene expression in AML samples but did demonstrate a subset of NPM-1+ HGF+ AML samples (n=7) expressing high levels of both HGF and c-met (p=0.0005, r=0.96). To confirm whether HGF/c-met autocrine interactions contributed to leukemogenesis in these cells, we treated immunodeficient mice engrafted with an HGF+ c-met+ human AML cell line (HEL) with vehicle vs. a c-met tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and noted growth inhibitory effects following c-met blockade. Conclusions HGF gene expression was an independent predictive factor for improved clinical outcome and was associated with NRP-1 expression, lower microvessel density, and NPM-1 negative status in normal karyotype AML patients. A subset of AML samples was identified with high concordant HGF and c-met expression consistent with autocrine pathways. Inhibition of HGF/c-met interactions in a preclinical AML model exerted anti-tumor effects. Additional studies of the diverse roles of HGF in myeloid leukemogenesis are warranted.
