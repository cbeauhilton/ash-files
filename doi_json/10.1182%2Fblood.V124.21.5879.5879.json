    "abstract_text": "Background: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a serious complication with a significant negative impact on survival following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in both adults and children. Immunosuppressants like steroids remain the mainstay of treatment which carries risks of increased infection frequency, a negative impact on the graft-versus-leukemia effect, and an increased probability of secondary malignancies. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) treatment, seems to ameliorate GVHD by immunomodulation, rather than immunosuppression. However it is difficult to perform in pediatric population. This is a retrospective review of 17 pediatric patients who underwent photopheresis with the Therakos Cellex system for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Procedure: Extracorporeal photopheresis regimen was same for all acute and chronic GVHD patients: initially every week (2 sessions/week) for two months, then every two weeks for two months; and finally, every month for at least one year. Demographic data, degree of GVHD before photopheresis, adverse reactions during photopheresis procedure, modification in immunosuppressive treatment, and response to photopheresis were recorded. Results: Acute GVHD occurred in seven patients, overlap and chronic GVHD occurred in five patients in each group. The improvement observed in eleven of twelve patients who have acute GVHD (90%) and in seven of ten chronic GVHD patients (70%). Thirteen patients had skin involvement before ECP and eleven of them responded to treatment (84%). Gastrointestinal involvement occurred in ten patients and seven of them improved during ECP treatment (70%). All of the four patient\u00b4s liver involvements failed to respond. No serious adverse reactions occurred. Conclusions: In conclusion, our study demonstrates that ECP with the Therakos Cellex system is a safe treatment option for GVHD in children.
