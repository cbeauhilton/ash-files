    "abstract_text": "The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has shown promising results in the clinical treatment of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (B-NHL). However, its therapeutic effect could still be improved. This study examined the anti-tumor activity of rituximab combined with histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in CD20-positivie B-NHL cell lines, as well as in primary B-NHL cells and a murine B-NHL model. The combination treatment sensitized B-NHL cells to apoptosis in a synergistic manner, concomitant with Bcl-2/Bcl-XL downregulation, mitochondrial instability, and caspase activation. Particularly in Daudi cells relatively insensitive to rituximab, these events were associated with nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) inactivation. SAHA presented functional complementation with rituximab, through decreasing IKKa/b and IkBa phosphorylation, thus preventing NF-kB nuclear translocation. In addition, SAHA induced IkBa cleavage to a stable inhibitory form and caused NF-kB degradation in response to caspase-3 activation. As an independent approach, co-administration of rituximab and SAHA resulted in a clear decline in levels of ERK cascade members, including extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (erk) itself, upstream Raf-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK Kinase Kinase-1 (mekk1), and mekk2, as well as their downstream transcription factor target c-myc. By western blot, c-Myc protein was subsequently downregulated when treated with rituximab or SAHA, and the degradation was most significant in combination group. More importantly, rituximab-SAHA combination significantly promoted primary B-NHL cells apoptosis and improved the survival time of a SCID mouse lymphoma model established with intravenous injection of Daudi cells. Terminal deoxytransferase-catalyzed DNA nick-end labeling and ultrastructural study revealed increased apoptotic lymphoma cells on mice spleen sections of combination group. Taken together, these findings emphasized the value of targeting apoptosis signaling pathway in lymphoma therapy. Rituximab in conjunction with histone deacetylase inhibitor may represent a novel strategy in treating patients with B-NHL."
