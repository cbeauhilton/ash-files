    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1735 The immune system plays a key role in preventing and controlling tumor growth. Cancer frequently induces a state of immune suppression in patients mediated, in part, through inhibition of dendritic cell (DC) differentiation. This results in the accumulation of actively immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and a loss of DCs (critical in the induction of T cell mediated immune responses), thus compromising the ability to initiate anti-tumor immune responses. This is mediated by tumor derived factors (TDFs)(e.g. VEGF) that inhibit DC differentiation by driving STAT3 hyperactivation. The downstream target(s) of this STAT3 signaling that inhibits DC differentiation, however, has not been defined. Previous work in our lab has identified protein kinase C \u03b2II (PKC \u03b2II) as being essential in myeloid progenitor to DC differentiation and demonstrated that PKC \u03b2II inhibition (signaling or expression) prevents DC differentiation. We've also found that PKC \u03b2II positively regulates its own expression and that, under certain circumstances, the PKC\u03b2 promoter is negatively regulated. These observations lead us to hypothesize that TDF activation of Stat3 inhibits DC differentiation by down regulating PKC \u03b2II expression. We've previously shown that culture in tumor conditioned media (TCM) decreased PKC \u03b2II protein levels and significantly reduced PKC \u03b2II mRNA transcript levels in KG1, a myeloid progenitor-like cell line long used to model DC differentiation. We've also previously seen that decreased PKC \u03b2II expression following culture in TCM significantly impaired DC differentiation, compared to cells grown in the absence of tumor conditions; however, the mechanism by which Stat3 signaling down regulated PKC \u03b2II expression remained unclear. We now show that culture in TCM reduced PKC\u03b2 promoter driven transcription 7-fold, compared to cells grown in normal media (p<0.01). Given the previously described importance of Stat3 hyperactivation in tumor-mediated suppression of DC differentiation, and since PKC \u03b2II down regulation appears to occur at the promoter level, we examined the role of Stat3 in regulating PKC \u03b2II expression. Culture in TCM rapidly (<5 min.) induced Stat3 phosphorylation, an indication of activation. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that TCM treatment induces direct interaction between Stat3 and the PKC\u03b2 promoter, suggesting that Stat3 signaling may act to decrease PKC \u03b2II expression. To directly test the role of Stat3 signaling in regulation of PKC \u03b2II expression, we generated a series of clones stably expressing wild type (WT) or constitutive active (CA) Stat3 constructs in K562, a second DC progenitor-like cell line. We've previously seen that clones stably expressing the CA-Stat3 construct have decreased PKC \u03b2II protein levels and significantly decreased PKC \u03b2II mRNA levels, compared to the parental cell line and WT-Stat3 clones. We now show that this decrease in PKC \u03b2II expression was dependent on constitutive Stat3 signaling, as pharmacologic Stat3 inhibition restored PKC \u03b2II expression to levels seen in the parental cell line. Consistent with the proposed model and our previous work, decreased PKC \u03b2II expression in clones expressing CA-Stat3 resulted in significantly inhibited phorbol ester driven DC differentiation (p<0.05)(as measured by allogenic T cell proliferation, a key measure of DC differentiation). Interestingly, we've also found that PKC \u03b2II antagonizes Stat3 signaling: myeloid progenitor-like cells (KG1a) overexpressing PKC \u03b2II do not exhibit Stat3 activation in response to TCM: PKC \u03b2II overexpression or activation led to down regulation of the receptors for G-CSF, IL-6, and VEGF, TDFs demonstrated to inhibit myeloid progenitor to DC differentiation. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which PKC \u03b2II negatively regulates the potential of a cell to respond to (tumor derived) inflammatory cytokines. This work demonstrates that tumor driven Stat3 hyperactivation down regulates PKC\u03b2 promoter activity, resulting in decreased PKC \u03b2II protein levels. In agreement with our previous work, this decrease in PKC \u03b2II expression impairs a cell's potential to undergo DC differentiation. Additionally, this work suggests that PKC \u03b2II signaling impairs a cell's potential to signal via Stat3 in response to TDFs, perhaps providing an avenue by which to block or reverse tumor mediated suppression of DC differentiation in cancer.
