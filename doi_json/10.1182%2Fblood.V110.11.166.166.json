    "abstract_text": "We recently showed that high levels of B cell Activating Factor (BAFF) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) correlate with chronic GVHD development. BAFF promotes survival and differentiation of human BCR-activated (CD27+) B cells into Ig-secreting cells (ISC). To examine whether BAFF drives ISC in cGVHD, CD27+ peripheral B subsets and plasma BAFF levels were examined in 57 patients \u2265 12 months after HSCT. Significantly higher BAFF levels were found in active and inactive cGVHD groups compared to control patients with no cGVHD. Patients with cGVHD had a relative reduction in naive B cells compared to controls, resulting in a preponderance of CD27+ B cells (Table 1). Both pre-germinal center [pre-GC (IgD+)] and post-GC (IgDLo) subsets had significantly increased CD27+ in active cGVHD (Table 2). When BAFF levels were compared with cell number, only active disease patients had a positive correlation between BAFF and plasmablasts (r=+0.51, p-value=0.013), suggesting CD27+ post-GC B cells are highly BAFF-dependent in cGVHD. Active and inactive cGVHD patients had a positive correlation between BAFF and number of CD27+ pre-GC cells (r=+0.5, r=+0.49, respectively, p-value=0.02 each). In vitro analysis of these infrequent B subpopulations was accomplished using a large-volume lymphocyte donation from an untreated active cGVHD patient. Plasmablast and pre-GC purified populations had distinctly higher apoptotic rates attenuated in vitro by BAFF. CD27+ pre-GC B cells were induced by BAFF to differentiate into post-GC plasmablasts, indicating that survival and differentiation effects likely explain the correlations between BAFF and pre and post-GC CD27+ B subsets in patients. Increased BAFF levels in patients with inactive disease also correlated with lower total B (r=\u22120.59, p=0.003) and memory subset numbers (r=\u22120.57, p=0.005) suggesting that simultaneous B cell turnover and reconstitution may occur as disease becomes inactive. Thus, peripheral CD27+ B cells differentiate into potentially alloreactive ISC in presence of excess BAFF without need for further antigen stimulation. These results implicate BAFF and BCR-activated B cells in cGVHD and provide a rationale for therapeutic use of BAFF antagonists in this disease.
