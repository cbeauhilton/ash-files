    "abstract_text": "Abstract 552 Bernard Soulier Syndrome (BSS) is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a defect in the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX complex. The main treatment for BSS is platelet transfusion but it is often limited to severe bleeding episodes or surgical interventions due to the risk of developing allo-immunization. Ware and colleagues have developed a murine model of BSS by targeting GPIb\u03b1 (GPIb\u03b1 null ), and have shown that the BSS phenotype was rescued by transgenic expression of hGPIb\u03b1. We have previously reported successful expression of human GPIb\u03b1 in human megakaryocytes using a lentiviral vector (LV) encoding hGPIb\u03b1 under the transcriptional control of integrin aIIb promoter (2bIb\u03b1). In this study, we examined the efficacy of this strategy for the gene therapy of BSS using GPIb\u03b1 null as a murine model of BSS. GPIb\u03b1 null hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) transduced with 2bIb\u03b1 LV were transplanted into lethally irradiated GPIb\u03b1 null littermates. After bone marrow (BM) reconstitution, mice were analyzed. The presence of 2bIb\u03b1 transgene in recipients was confirmed by PCR amplification of white blood cell derived genomic DNA. Flow cytometry demonstrated that 84.5% \u00b1 9.5% (n = 9) of platelets expressed hGPIb\u03b1 at 6 weeks after transplantation and stable expression was maintained through the entire observation period of 7 months. Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy demonstrated that transgene protein was expressed on the cell surface of transduced platelets. Tail bleeding times were corrected to normal levels in the GPIb\u03b1 null recipients who received LV transduced GPIb\u03b1 null HSC (2.3 \u00b1 2.9 minutes, n = 9). On the other hand, recipients who received untransduced GPIb\u03b1 null HSC exhibited prolonged bleeding times (8.8 \u00b1 2.4 minutes, n = 4) that were similar to GPIb\u03b1 null mice. Macrothrombocytopenia improved with significantly increased platelet counts and decreased platelet sizes in LV transduced GPIb\u03b1 null HSC recipients compared to untransduced GPIb\u03b1 null HSC recipients (platelet counts; 4.9 \u00b1 1.3\u00d710 5 /\u03bc l, n = 9 vs. 1.8 \u00b1 0.1\u00d710 5 /\u03bc l, n = 4, and mean platelet volume; 6.9 \u00b1 0.7 fL, n = 9 vs. 9.3 \u00b1 0.1 fL, n = 4, respectively). As expected, expression levels of hGPIb\u03b1 correlated with platelet counts and inversely correlated with the platelet size. Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis showed that hGPIb\u03b1 expressed on platelets associated with endogenous murine GPIb\u03b2 and GPIX. No antibody to hGPIb\u03b1 was detected in these recipients. Furthermore, BM mononuclear cells from the primary recipients were transplanted into the secondary GPIb\u03b1 null recipients and the results showed sustained expression of hGPIb\u03b1 leading to the correction of bleeding phenotype as well as macrothrombocytopenia. These results demonstrate that lentivirus mediated gene transfer can provide sustained phenotypic correction of murine BSS, indicating that this approach may be a promising strategy for gene therapy of BSS in human.
