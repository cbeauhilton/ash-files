    "abstract_text": "Introduction : We previously reported that plerixafor + G-CSF was as safe as and more effective than placebo + G-CSF in mobilizing hematopoietic stem cell for autologous transplant in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) through 100 days follow-up (DiPersio ASH 2007). We report herein the 12 months data. Methods : This is a phase 3, multi-center, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebocontrolled study. Multiple myeloma patients requiring an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, in first or second complete or partial remission were eligible. Patients received G-CSF (10\u03bcg/kg/day) subcutaneously for up to 8 days. Beginning on evening of Day 4 and continuing daily for up to 4 days, patients received either plerixafor (240\u03bcg/kg) or placebo subcutaneously. Starting on Day 5, patients began daily apheresis for up to 4 days or until \u2265 6 x 10 6 CD34+cells/kg were collected. We report herein the 12 months graft durability and hematology data. Results : As reported previously, the primary endpoint of collecting \u2265 6 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg in \u2264 2 days of apheresis was met in 106/148 (71.6%) patients in the plerixafor group and 53/154 (34.4%) patients in the placebo group, p<0.001. 142 (96%) patients in plerixafor group and 136 (88%) patients in placebo group underwent transplantation. Median time to PMN and PLT engraftment was similar in both groups. Through 12 months follow-up, there were no differences in graft durability and hematology profiles between groups (Table 1). Over the 12 months, 6/142 (4.2%) patients in the plerixafor group and 5/136 (3.7%) patients in the placebo group died. Of the patients who died, 2 patients in the plerixafor group and 2 patients in the placebo grouped died due to disease progression.  . Plerixafor + G-CSF . Placebo + G-CSF .

Importantly, this 12 months report showed that transplants with cells collected with plerixafor resulted in graft durability rates that were similar to cells collected with G-CSF alone."
