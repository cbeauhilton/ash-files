    "abstract_text": "Given the tremendous need for and potential of umbilical cord blood to be utilized as a donor source for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in adults, there is a strong push to overcome the constraints created by the limited volumes and subsequent limited hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell numbers available for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a single collection. We have previously described the use of CD26 inhibitor treatment of donor cells as a method to increase the transplant efficiency of mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells into a mouse recipient ( Christopherson, KW 2nd, et al, Science  2004 . 305 : 1000 \u20131003 ). We therefore hypothesized that inhibition of CD26 on human donor cord blood prior to transplant would result in an increase in long-term engraftment potential. To test this hypothesis, we isolated CD34 enriched (CD34 + ) or lineage depleted (lin \u2212 ) pooled cord blood cells, evaluated their level of CD26 expression and activity, and then tested their ability to engraft into the NOD/SCID/B2m null immunodeficient mouse model of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with or without prior CD26 inhibitor treatment. We observed that long-term engraftment into the recipient mouse bone marrow at twelve weeks post sub-lethal irradiation (350cGy), followed by transplantation of 1x10 5 pooled donor cells was 13.4\u00b12.0% and 55.5\u00b14.0% CD45 + human cells in the untreated, and CD26 inhibitor (Diprotin A) treated CD34 + donor cells respectively. We also observed engraftment levels in the mouse recipient bone marrow of 6.2\u00b10.7% and 47.0\u00b12.8% CD45 + human cells for untreated and CD26 inhibitor treated lin \u2212 cells respectively. These measurements represent approximately a 4-fold and 7.5-fold improvement in the engraftment of long-term repopulating cells resulting from CD26 inhibitor treatment of either CD34 + or lin \u2212 donor cells respectively. These pre-clinical results establish a basis on which to propose the use of CD26 inhibitor treatment of donor cord blood units prior to transplantation for the purpose of improving transplant efficiency and subsequently patient outcome.",
