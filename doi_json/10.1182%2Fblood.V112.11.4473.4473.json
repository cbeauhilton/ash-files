    "abstract_text": "Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease of monoclonal malignant plasma cells. Treatment of MM with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs has resulted in improved response rates, however, with no sufficient improvement in overall survival. Bortezomib has been recently used and results in significant clinical responses in refractory MM. However, many patients relapse and become refractory to cytotoxic therapies and, hence, the need for new therapies. We have generated an Anti-TfR-IgG3-Avidin Fusion Protein (Anti-TfR-IgG3-Av) that can bind MM which express high levels of transferrin receptor and can deliver biotinylated molecules into cancer cells ( Ng et al PNAS  2002 ; 79 : 10706 ). We have reported that treatment of MM with Anti-TfR-IgG3-Av results in inhibition of cell proliferation and direct cytotoxicity in few cell lines. Further, we have also found that Anti-TfR-IgG3-Av can sensitize resistant MM cells to drugs (eg. CDDP)-induced apoptosis. Sensitization by Anti-TfR-IgG3-Av resulted in the inhibition of several anti-apoptotic gene products like XIAP, Bid, Bcl-2 and Bcl XL . Since these gene products are regulated by the NF-\u03baB pathway, we hypothesized that Anti-TfR-IgG3-Av may inhibit the AKT pathway in MM cell lines. The AKT signaling inactivates several pro-apoptotic factors, such as Bad, which is phosphorylated and inhibits its binding and inactivation of Bcl XL . AKT also activates I\u03baB kinase (IKK) to phosphorylate I\u03baB (inhibitor of NF-\u03baB ) and leading to its proteasomal degradation and NF-\u03baB nuclear localization. The AKT and NF-\u03baB pathways result in the transcription of many anti-apoptotic gene products like XIAP, Bcl-2, survivin and Bcl XL . Treatment of MM cell lines with Anti-TfR-IgG3-Av resulted in inhibition of phospho-AKT and inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity and downstream inhibition of above anti-apoptotic gene products. We then examined the roles of AKT and NF-\u03baB in Anti-TfR-IgG3-Av-induced sensitization of MM to CDDP-apoptosis. Treatment of IM-9 cells with siRNA AKT, not control siRNA, resulted in inhibition of AKT concomitantly with inhibition of Bcl-2 and survive in. The cells treated with si-RNA AKT were sensitized to CDDP-induced apoptosis. These findings suggested that Anti-Anti-TfR-IgG3-Av-induced sensitization to CDDP may be due, in part, to inhibition of AKT. Likewise, the role of NF-\u03baB inhibition by Anti-TfR-IgG3-Av in the sensitization to CDDP was demonstrated by the use of the specific NF-\u03baB inhibitor, DHMEQ. Thus, both inhibition of AKT and NF-\u03baB pathways by Anti-TfR-IgG3-Av play a major role in Anti-TfR-IgG3-Av-induced sensitization to CDDP. The apoptosis achieved by the combination of Anti-TfR-IgG3-Av and CDDP resulted from the complementation of several gene products modified by each agent alone and resulting in the activation of caspases 9, 8 and 3 and apoptosis. The above findings provide an underlying mechanism of Anti-TfR-IgG3-Av-induced cell signaling modification that renders drug-resistant MM cells sensitive to apoptosis by drugs."
