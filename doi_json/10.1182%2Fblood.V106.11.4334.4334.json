    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Waldenstro\u0308m\u2019s Macroglobulinemia (WM) is an uncommon lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by bone marrow infiltration of the lymphoplasmocytic cells and IgM monoclonal gammopathy. The normal counterpart of the WM malignant cell is believed to be a post germinal-center B cell. However, the low frequency of WM has hampered investigation into Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain (IgH) rearrangements in large series of patients and whether preferential use of specific genetic segments or non-functional rearrangements exits. Aim: Molecular characterization in a large cohort of WM patients analyzing their functional, complete VDJH, and non-functional, incomplete DJH, IgH rearrangements, the pattern of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and gene segment usage. Patients and methods: 47 patients with unequivocal diagnosis of WM were included in the study. Bone Marrow samples (always with more than 10% of tumor cell) were used for amplification of clonal rearrangements employing the Biomed-2 strategy ( Leukemia  2003 ; 17 ; 2257 ) , followed by direct automated sequencing in ABI 377 DNA sequencer using Big-Dye terminators (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Results: All patients showed a monoclonal amplification of at least one VDJH or DJH rearrangement. VDJH monoclonal rearrangements were detected in 42/47 (89.3%) patients while DJH were observed in 20 (42.5%) patients. VH, DH and JH gene segment usage : VH3 gene segment was the most commonly represented family (76,2%) while the other gene segments were scarcely detectable, and VH5 was totally absent. In the complete VDJH rearrangements, DH6 was the family most commonly represented while DH2 (45%) and DH4 (30%) were the most common in the incomplete DJH rearrangement. Regarding JH elements, JH4 (38%) was the most represented in the complete rearrangements and JH5 (46%) in the incomplete rearrangements. Somatic hypermutation : SHM were observed in all except two of the cases (94%, 34 of 36 cases), in which the study could be performed. (median 9,38; range2.9\u201316.6). In the remaining clonal cases (6 cases, 14.3%) no amplification of FR1 region was obtained, also suggesting the presence of SHM. Conclusions: In this series of patients, we observed the presence of incomplete rearrangements with an incidence similar (44%) to that described in multiple myeloma. The preferential usage for determined families of genetic segments, in VDJH and in DJH, suggests the presence of positive and negative selection processes. Finally, the majority, (94 %) of the cases, presented SHM, although the presence of two patients lacking in SHM suggests a pre-follicular origin for some WM cases.",
