    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2897 EphA3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed at high level on the surface of some solid tumors and certain leukemias. KB004 is a high-affinity non-fucosylated, recombinant antibody developed by KaloBios derived from a mouse monoclonal anti-EphA3 antibody using Antibody Humaneering\u2122 Technology. The antibody binds EphA3 from human and cynomolgus macaque with equivalent affinity (610 pM for human and 570 pM for cynomolgus as determined by surface plasmon resonance (spr) analysis) making the latter a relevant toxicology species. KB004 has a direct pro-apoptotic effect on EphA3-positive cells and a induces potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity mediated by CD16-expressing effector cells. The non-fucosylated antibody has enhanced affinity for both human and cynomolgus CD16a. The affinity of KB004 for cynomolgus CD16a (7.2 nM, determined by spr analysis) was comparable to the affinity for the high-affinity variant of CD16a from humans (6.6 nM), indicating that KB004 has similar potential for ADCC in cynomolgus macaques. We first demonstrated cell-surface expression of EphA3 by flow cytometry in approximately 50% of primary human leukemia cells. Here we extend the analysis to multiple myeloma (MM) in which 3/5 patient samples show EphA3 expression. EphA3 expression was confirmed in a panel of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) samples [n=14] and in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [n=40] in which EphA3+ cells were identified in each French American British (FAB) classification sub-type except M0, for which only two samples were studied. CD123-positive leukemia stem cells (CD34 + CD38 \u2212 CD123 + ) also displayed surface expression of EphA3. KB004 induced apoptosis in EphA3 + primary cells from each of the diseases analyzed, including imatinib-sensitive and resistant CML, with no activity in EphA3-negative specimens, including normal CD34 + bone marrow cells. KB004 inhibited myeloid leukemia colony formation (CFU-L) from primary AML samples in methylcellulose colony assays without affecting normal hematopoietic colony recovery and also showed dose-dependent inhibition of long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) from AML stem cells. EphA3 expression was not detected on primary human CD34+ bone marrow cells from healthy individuals. These data support the development of an anti-EphA3 antibody for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. The selective activity against leukemic stem cells supports a novel strategy for therapeutic targeting of leukemia-initiating cells. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
