    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Recent EBMT analysis showed that infections are responsible for 21% of deaths after allo-HCT and 11% after auto-HCT. However, the risk, types and outcome of infections vary between age groups. The aim of the study is the direct comparison of risk factors of incidence and outcome of infections in children and adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed risk factors for the incidence and outcome of bacterial, fungal, and viral infections in 650 children and 3200 adults who received HCT between 2012-2015. The risk factors were determined by multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total number of 395/650 (60.8%) children and 1122/3200 (35.0%) adults were diagnosed for microbiologically confirmed infection, including 345/499 (69.1%) and 679/1070 (63.5%), respectively after allo-HCT, and 50/151 (33.1%) and 443/2130 (20.8%) respectively, after auto-HCT. At 2 years after HCT, the incidences of microbiologically documented bacterial infection were 36.0% and 27.6%, (p21d) hematological recovery (HR=3.3; p21 days (HR=1.4; p=0.038) were associated with increased risk of death from infection. Among patients with bacterial infections, the risk was higher in G- infections (HR=1.6; p=0.031). Among auto-HCT patients, no child died of infection. In adults, the risk of death was higher if duration of treatment of infection was >21 days (HR=1.7; p<0.001). In patients with MM the risk was decreased (HR=0.4; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The profile of infections and related deaths varies between children and adults. MMUD transplants, diagnosis of acute leukemia, chronic GVHD, CMV reactivation and prolonged infection are relative risk factors for death from infection after HCT.
