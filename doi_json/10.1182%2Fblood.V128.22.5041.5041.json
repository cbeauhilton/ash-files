    "abstract_text": "Background: Transfusion Services in Saudi Arabia are mainly hospital-based, where each major hospital recruit donors, test for Hepatitis B service antigen (HBs Ag), Hepatitis C antibody (Anti-HCV), Human Immune Deficiency Virus antibody (Anti-HIV), and Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) for HBV-DNA, HCV-RNA, and HIV-RNA. In addition, Anti-HBc and Anti-HBs titer are tested for those who are negative for HBs Antigen and NAT, so that blood products from donors with high Anti-HBs titer (>100 u/ml) can be used. The aim of this limited retrospective study is to find out the prevalence of Anti-HBc among blood donors in different blood donation centers in Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia and current policies regarding blood utilization from donors with positive Anti-HBc. Materials and Methods: We reviewed blood donor records in 4 large hospitals in Riyadh between 2011-2015. Hospital names are not disclosed for confidentiality reasons. Instead, they were named A, B, C, and D Results: (see Table) 1- The overall prevalence of Anti-HBc positive blood donors is 6.2%, however, there is a significant variation among institutions ranging from 2.8 % to 11.1 % (which needs to be investigated to explain reasons for this variation). 2- Some institutions defer all donors with positive anti-HBc (although they carry out all tests), while others carry out anti-HBs and NAT testing and use blood with high titer anti-HBs (> 100 u/ml). Conclusion: There is a need for an expert consensus opinion regarding the cost-effectiveness of anti-HBc for either donor deferral or proceeding to NAT and anti-HBs titer testing. Such a consensus is practiced in many countries, based on the prevalence of anti-HBc and the availability of NAT testing View large Download slide View large Download slide  Close modal Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
