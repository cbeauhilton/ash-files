    "abstract_text": "Localized pathologic thrombin generation by the tissue factor/factor VII (TF/FVII)-dependent extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation has been suggested to be the key initiator of thrombosis following blood vessel injury and exposure of blood to the subendothelial matrix that contains coagulation/platelet activator matrix proteins, such as collagen and TF. Inherited FVII deficiency (30 days) systemic anticoagulation, as evidenced by PT increase that reached 2.0-2.6 fold baseline. Surprisingly, fibrin deposition was not affected, and platelet deposition in the thrombogenic devices (N=8) was also not inhibited on collagen-coated grafts, and only marginally inhibited on TF. Treatment with vitamin K antagonists that reduces the level of vitamin K-dependent coagulation enzymes, including FVII, also prolong the PT. Warfarin-induced doubling of the PT is antithrombotic and moderately safe. Yet, in this study where FVII ASO selectively reduced FVII levels, the observed and significant PT prolongation was not associated with anti-fibrin or anti-platelet effects on collagen, and showed an unremarkable anti-platelet effect on TF. We conclude that if the TF/FVII pathway drives the propagation of large vessel thrombi under flow in primates indeed, very low FVII activity (\u22481%) must be sufficient to sustain thrombogenesis, supporting the clinical data on deep vein thrombosis, routinely observed in FVII deficiency. Since FVII activity cannot be entirely eliminated without bleeding risks, these data suggest that targeting the TF/FVII pathway with FVII ASO or inhibitors may not be an entirely sound antithrombotic treatment approach.
