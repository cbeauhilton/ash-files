    "abstract_text": "Introduction Hepatic veno-occlusive disease, also called sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS), is an unpredictable, potentially life-threatening complication of conditioning for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Reported mean incidence of VOD/SOS following HSCT is an estimated 13.7% (range 0%-62.3%). VOD/SOS with multi-organ dysfunction (MOD) may be associated with >80% mortality. Endothelial cell (EC) damage, triggered by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic conditioning regimens and a prothrombotic-hypofibrinolytic state, is a critical factor in the pathophysiology of VOD/SOS. In the United States, defibrotide is approved for treating hepatic VOD/SOS with renal or pulmonary dysfunction post-HSCT, and in the European Union, defibrotide is approved to treat severe hepatic VOD/SOS post-HSCT. Prior to its approval, defibrotide had been available in the United States through an expanded-access program. Here, Day +100 post-HSCT survival and safety are analyzed for the 2 largest primary-disease subgroups in that study: acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Methods Patients in the expanded-access program had VOD/SOS diagnosed by Baltimore criteria (bilirubin \u22652 mg/dL and \u22652 of: hepatomegaly, ascites, \u22655% weight gain), modified Seattle criteria (\u22652 of: total bilirubin >2 mg/dL, hepatomegaly, or ascites and/or \u22655% weight gain [in this study]), or biopsy, and this study included patients with or without MOD (defined by renal and/or pulmonary dysfunction). Defibrotide 25 mg/kg/day was given in 4 divided doses for a recommended \u226521 days. Results A total of 867 patients were enrolled in the safety population of the expanded-access program through April 18, 2015, including 476 patients with MOD. The primary diseases affecting 5% or more of the safety population at baseline were AML, 25.7% (222/867); ALL, 23.4% (202/867); neuroblastoma, 8.5% (73/867); and myelodysplastic syndrome, 5.7% (27/867). Data were available for 756 post-HSCT patients who received \u22651 dose of defibrotide. Of those patients, 207 (27.4%) patients had AML and 152 (20.1%) patients had ALL as their primary disease. Of the AML patients, 49.8% (103/207) were male, and 50.2% (104/207) were female; median age at HSCT was 23 years (range: 0.5, 74.0 years); and all had allogeneic HSCT. Among the ALL patients, 62.5% (95/152) were male, and 37.5% (57/152) were female; median age at HSCT was 16 years (range: 0.3, 68.0 years); and all had allogeneic HSCT. At Day +100 post-HSCT, observed survival was 45.4% (94/207) among AML patients and 42.8% (65/152) among ALL patients; 50.7% (105/207) and 52.0% (79/152), respectively, had died; and status was not available (ie, no HSCT date recorded, did not have sufficient follow-up, or their data were not available) for 3.9% (8/207) and 5.3% (8/152), respectively. For AML patients, Kaplan-Meier estimated survival rate was 47.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.7%-54.5%; Figure 1 ); among ALL patients, Kaplan-Meier estimated survival rate was 46.0% (95% CI, 37.7%-53.9%; Figure 2 ). Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 76.8% (159/207) of AML patients and 64.5% (98/152) of ALL patients, with serious AEs in 57.5% (119/207) and 52.6% (80/152), respectively. Treatment-related AEs, as assessed by investigators, occurred in 21.7% (45/207) of AML patients and 17.1% (26/152) of ALL patients (>2% in either group [all 2% in either group [all 1 patient in either subgroup. Conclusions The Day +100 survival rates and safety profile for the AML and ALL subgroups in the expanded-access program were consistent with prior defibrotide studies and analyses of the overall HSCT population in this study. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival at Day +100 were similar between the AML (47.8%) and ALL (46.0%) subgroups. Taken together, these subgroup results affirm the overall efficacy and safety profile of defibrotide in post-HSCT patients with VOD/SOS and underlying acute leukemia. Support: Jazz Pharmaceuticals.
