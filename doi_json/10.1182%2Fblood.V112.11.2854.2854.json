    "abstract_text": "Platelets contain high levels of Src family kinases (SFKs) suggesting an important role for these enzymes in platelet function. In this study, we have investigated the regulation of platelet function by SFKs downstream of G12/13 pathways. Calcium-independent platelet shape change induced by selective G12/13 stimulation with YFLLRNP was potentiated with a small mobilization of intracellular calcium in the presence of SFK inhibitors PP1 or PP2, which was abolished by the chelation of intracellular calcium, suggesting that SFKs downstream of G12/13 negatively regulate calcium mobilization in platelets. In addition, PP1 or PP2 caused a leftward shift of human platelet aggregation, secretion, and calcium response induced by low concentrations of agonists that activate platelets through G12/13 signaling such as PAR1-activating peptide SFLLRN and PAR4-activating peptide AYPGKF. However, 2-MeSADP-induced calcium response and platelet aggregation were not affected by the presence of PP1 or PP2, suggesting that SFKs downstream of G12/13, but not Gq/Gi, pathways are involved in this platelet response. Moreover, platelet aggregation and secretion caused by combined stimulation of G12/13 and Gi/Gz (YFLLRNP + 2-MeSADP with P2Y1 antagonist/epinephrine) were also potentiated in the presence of PP1 or PP2 confirming the contribution of SFKs downstream of G12/13 as a negative regulator to platelet activation. Potentiation of platelet aggregation in the presence of SFK inhibitors was not affected in the presence of GF109203X, while PP2 failed to potentiate platelet aggregation in the presence of 5,5\u2032-dimethyl-BAPTA indicating that potentiation of cytosolic calcium may have an important role in this enhanced platelet responses by SFK inhibition. Moreover, PP1 or PP2 failed to potentiate platelet responses in the presence of Gq selective inhibitor YM-254890 or in Gq-deficient platelets, indicating that SFKs negatively regulate platelet responses through modulation of Gq signaling pathways. Importantly, AYPGKF-induced platelet aggregation, secretion, and calcium response were potentiated in Fyn-, but not in Lyn-, deficient platelets compared to the wild-type mouse platelets, whereas 2-MeSADP-induced platelet response was not affected in these platelets. We conclude that SFKs activated downstream of G12/13, but not Gq/Gi, pathways negatively regulate platelet responses by inhibiting intracellular calcium mobilization in platelets through Gq signaling pathways. Specifically, we define that Fyn plays a major role in this negatively regulatory pathway."
