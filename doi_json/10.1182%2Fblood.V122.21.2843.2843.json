    "abstract_text": "The myeloproliferative neoplasms, polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET), are characterized by clonal hematopoiesis that is often associated with a JAK2 V617F mutation, although this does not appear to be a disease-initiating event. Treatment of PV and ET with pegylated interferon-alpha (pegInf\u03b1) has been shown to lead to hematological remission, a decrease in the JAK2 V617F allelic burden in many cases, and even a reversion to polyclonal hematopoiesis. Despite promising therapeutic results, the mechanism of pegInf\u03b1-induced remission remains elusive. There are several potential mechanisms through which pegInf\u03b1 may be acting, which include stimulating the immune system in order to more effectively suppress the aberrant PV clones, enhancing the activation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), or by selectively suppressing the mutant clones. It has been previously reported that PV patients on pegInf\u03b1 have an increased number of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) in the peripheral blood as compared to untreated or hydroxyurea treated patients (Riley Blood , 2011), which suggests that PegIFNa maybe altering immunity against the mutated clone. However, we have found that interferon treatment leads to increased proliferation of HSCs and myeloid-specific differentiation in mice (Baldridge Nature , 2010). If this finding is also true in humans, it suggests the return to polyclonality after pegInf\u03b1 could also involve an increase in normal HSC proliferation. In order to address this question, we are studying the effects of pegInf\u03b1 treatment on the Tregs and HSCs of PV and EV patients, when compared to hydroxyurea or untreated patients. Previously we showed that pegInf\u03b1 treatment reduced the JAK2 V617F allelic burden in 17 out of 32 patients. Of the 13 female patients for which clonality could be assessed, one developed polyclonal hematopoiesis with three-fold reduction of JAK2 V617F allelic burden, but one developed polyclonal hematopoiesis during therapy despite no reduction in the JAK2 V617F allelic burden, suggesting that pegInf\u03b1 treatment is able to affect both pre- JAK2 V617F clones and JAK2 V617F -positive PV clones. We have now assessed changes in the HSC population in response to pegInf\u03b1 treatment. Upon analysis of bone marrow samples from these same pegInf\u03b1 or hydroxyurea treated patients, we found that the number of HSCs (CD45+CD34+CD38-) was increased in patients treated with pegInf\u03b1. Further we saw a decrease in the percent of quiescent HSCs in the pegInf\u03b1 treated samples, measured by the percentage of cells in G0, suggesting a more actively proliferating HSC population. In agreement with these data, our RNA analysis of the HSCs showed an increase in the expression of cell cycle genes in response to short-term pegInf\u03b1 treatment. In addition to this apparent increase in HSC proliferation, we also saw an increase in the number of colonies formed in methocult media from the bone marrow samples of the pegInf\u03b1 treated patients, suggesting an increase in myeloid specific differentiation. When we analyzed the RNA of patients who had received long-term pegInf\u03b1 treatment, we saw a transcriptional profile that was indicative of cell death. Taken together, these data suggest a model in which pegInf\u03b1 treatment is allowing for a return to polyclonal hematopoiesis by inducing cell division and differentiation of normal HSCs, while suppressing the pre-JAK2 V617F or JAK2 V617F -positive PV and ET clones, possibly by promoting apoptosis or inducing an immune-mediated cell death. Our findings do not exclude other potential mechanisms for salutary effects of pegInf\u03b1 for treatment of PV and ET (see accompanying abstract by Swierczek et al).
