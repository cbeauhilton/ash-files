    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5117 Background- Thalidomide (Thal) is a pro-apoptotic, immunoregulatory and antiangiogenic agent for MM. Although it is used since the 90's, the optimal combined treatment remains inconclusive. This is a preliminary analysis of the first Latin American prospective open-label study comparing three different combinations with Thal for MM patients not eligible for autologous SCT. Patients and Methods- Eligible patients were randomized to one of the three arms and received nine 28-days induction cycles. All patients received Thal(100\u2013200mg/d) and one of the following: A- Cyclo (50mg/d)+ Dexa (40mg/D1-4, 15\u201318 in cycles 1 and 2, D1-4 in cycles 3 to 9), B- Dexa (40mg/D1-4, 9\u201312, 17\u201320 in cycles 1,3,5,7 and 9, D1-4 in even cycles) or C- Mel (4mg/m 2 /7d)+ Pred (40mg/m 2 /7d). Thereafter, they were randomized to maintenance treatment until progression disease or unacceptable toxicity, as follows: A1-Thal (100mg/d)+Pred (50mg/each other day) or B1-(Thal 100mg/d). All patients received aspirin as thromboprophylaxis and sulpha-trimetroprim as prophylaxis for infection. If indicated, they received biphosphonate monthly for 24 months, and then quarterly. Before study initiation, informed consent was obtained from patients and evaluation was performed at the end of each cycle. The primary endpoint were response rate and response duration. The secondary endpoints were safety, OS and PFS. IMWG index was utilized to analyze response criteria. SPSS 15.0 for windows\u00ae were used for statistical analysis. Results- Enrolment started on February 2007, and a total of 60 patients have been included. Median age at randomization was 71 (56\u201384) years-old, and 52% of patients were female. Durie-Salmon stages were 12% II, 82% III and ISS stages were 47% II and 28% III. Fifty-one per cent of patients presented IgG monoclonal component. There were no significant differences comparing response > VGPR and treatment arms after three, six and nine cycles. However, the PFS is significant when compared CTD/MPT and TD arms (p=0.01). There was no difference in OS. Discussion- This analysis showed that Thal combinations are effective in MM patient treatment. We have not observed different responses between the tree arms. The progression free survival is significant in favor of alkylating combination than thal+dexa (p=0.01). Toxicity was manageable and balanced between the tree different arms. We would like to thank Dr. Jesus San Miguel and Dra. Maria-Victoria Mateos who have collaborated in this study. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
