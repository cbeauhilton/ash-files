    "abstract_text": "Background: The addition of etoposide to chemotherapy regimens (e.g.- CHOEP and EPOCH) may be beneficial for the treatment of aggressive lymphomas. Previous studies have shown decreased clearance of etoposide in hepatic impairment leading to a dose reduction or removal of drug. Total clearance of etoposide does not change significantly in patients with elevated bilirubin. However, free (or unbound) etoposide levels are a more accurate measurement of drug clearance (Stewart el al. Changes in the Clearance of Total and Unbound Etoposide in Patients with Liver Dysfunction. J Clin Oncol. 1990 Nov;8(11):1874-9.). No studies have analyzed etoposide pharmacokinetics and clinical toxicity in lymphoma patients with hepatic impairment. Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed aggressive lymphoma received 1 to 8 cycles of DA-EPOCH +/-R at the NCI. Of 56 pts studied, 48 had normal and 8 had elevated bilirubin (median 3.4mg/dL, range 1.4-22.5mg/dL). All patients received full dose etoposide at 200mg/m 2 over 96-hours on cycle 1. Blood samples were collected at 0, 22 and 96 hours after infusion began. Results: There was no significant difference between free etoposide clearance (Cl) and the free etoposide concentration (Css) in patients with elevated versus normal bilirubin (see table below). In all patients, irrespective of bilirubin, there was no significant correlation between free etoposide Cl, free etoposide Css and creatinine clearance (CrCl) or age. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was higher in patients with elevated bilirubin. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 75% (6/8) versus 85% (41/48) and PR in 0% (0/8) vs 4% (2/48) of patients with elevated vs normal bilirubin. Conclusions: Etoposide pharmacokinetics were not altered in patients with abnormal versus normal hepatic function. Although there was an increase in hematologic toxicities, there was no difference in Css or Cl of etoposide. Importantly, there were no significant differences in febrile neutropenia or grade 3/4 toxicities. The toxicity difference is likely attributed to other drugs. Response rates were similar between the 2 groups. Our results do not support the empiric dose reduction of etoposide in patients with aggressive lymphomas receiving potentially curative treatment.
