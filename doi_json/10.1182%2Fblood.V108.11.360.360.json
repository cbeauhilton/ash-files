    "abstract_text": "Chimeric fusion proteins involving Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha (RAR\u03b1) invariantly associate with almost 100% of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL). While we and others have recently demonstrated an essential role of aberrant self-association in RAR\u03b1 fusions mediated transformation 1 , 2 , forced oligomerization of truncated transcription factors including MLL 3 and AML1 4 has emerged as an important oncogenic property shared by these most common chimeric fusion proteins involved in AML. To further characterize the underlying mechanisms and its modes of action, the present study dissects the essential molecular properties and transformation mechanisms by oligomeric RAR\u03b1-oncoproteins. Firstly, we define the oncogenic threshold of self-association by showing that homo-oligomerization rather than homo-dimerization is required for Stat5b-RAR\u03b1 mediated transformation of primary hematopoietic cells. Although constitutive transcriptional repression is believed to be the underlying mechanism for RAR\u03b1-mediated transformation, oligomeric RAR\u03b1 fusion proteins can bind retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) either as homo-oligomers or higher order hetero-oligomers with RXR\u03b1. To gain further insights into the transcriptional control mediated by RAR\u03b1 fusions, we successfully constructed various Stat5b-RAR\u03b1 point mutants that maintained the homo-oligomerization properties but lost their abilities to bind DNA as homo-oligomers. These resulting mutants could still efficiently transform primary hematopoietic cells in spite of their lack of homo-oligomeric DNA binding ability. To investigate if this is unique to Stat5b-RAR\u03b1 or is a general phenomena that can also apply to other RAR\u03b1 fusions, we further demonstrated that the synthetic FKBP-RAR\u03b1 fusion, which closely mimick both biochemical and transformation properties of bona fide RAR\u03b1 fusion proteins, was incapable of binding DNA as homo-oligomers, suggesting that homo-oligomeric DNA-binding is dispensable for RAR\u03b1-mediated transformation. Conversely we reveal that the higher-order RAR\u03b1-fusion/RXR\u03b1 hetero-oligomeric complex, which aberrantly recruits transcriptional co-repressor SMRT, represents the major functional DNA-binding module. Specific knockdown of RXR\u03b1 expression using shRNA approach can suppress transformation mediated by both bona fide and synthetic RAR\u03b1 fusion proteins, thus indicating a critical functional role of RXR\u03b1 in RAR\u03b1-mediated transformation of primary hematopoietic cells. Finally to assess the possible therapeutic values of targeting RXR\u03b1-mediated pathways in RAR\u03b1-mediated transformation, we also demonstrated specific inhibition of myeloid transformation mediated by various RAR\u03b1 oncoproteins using the panRXR-selective agonist, SR11237. Taken together, these results not only highlight the functional significance of higher-order RAR\u03b1-fusion/RXR\u03b1 hetero-oligomeric complex, but also attest RXR\u03b1 as a potential therapeutic target for APL."
