    "abstract_text": "A pool of free \u03b1 chains as well as hemin appears compatible with cellular homeostasis and important for ensuring efficient assembly with non-\u03b1 globin chains to form functional hemoglobin tetramers in erythroid cells. Furthermore, globin-chain assembly with partner chains and efficient assembly of subunits to form functional hemoglobin is critical to prevent accumulation of unstable single globin chains which could lead to cell destruction. Efficient assembly also is critical for optimizing gene therapy for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies, since one therapeutic scenario involves expression of excess \u03b2-chain variants or \u03b3-globin chains. We studied determinants for efficient assembly of \u03b1\u03b3 hetero-dimers followed by tetrameric Hb F formation. Indeed, \u03b3-globin chains in Hb F are negatively charged; and, therefore, they would be expected to assemble efficiently with positively charged \u03b1 chains. However, Hb F formation in vitro using purified \u03b3- and \u03b1-globin chains is very slow compared to Hb A formation from purified \u03b2- and \u03b1-globin chains. This slow Hb F formation in vitro is to some extent due to stable \u03b32-dimer formation. Differences in amino acids at \u03b11\u03b21 and \u03b11\u03b31 interaction sites and differences in surface charge also lead to different in vitro assembly rates for Hb A and Hb F. In contrast, expressed radiolabeled \u03b3- and \u03b2-globin chains made in a wheat germ, coupled cell-free transcription/translation system using \u03b3- and \u03b2-globin cDNA expression vectors with excess unlabeled \u03b1 chains added prior to translation initiation showed similar formation rates for radiolabeled Hb A and Hb F. These results suggested in the absence of free \u03b1 chains the newly translated monomeric \u03b3 chains form stable homo-dimers in erythroid cells, which leads to lower levels of \u03b1\u03b3 dimers. Therefore, we assessed formation of Hb A and Hb F after expression of radiolabeled \u03b2- or \u03b3-globin chains in a wheat germ, coupled cell-free transcription/translation system. Results indicate that assembly of Hb F, but not Hb A, is enhanced by early addition of excess free \u03b1 chains that act by inhibiting the formation of stable \u03b32 homo-dimers. Mutational analysis of truncated \u03b3-globin chains showed that removal of more than 11 but not 2 amino acids from the carboxy terminus of \u03b3 chains inhibits assembly with \u03b1 chains. Polysome profile studies showed that all carboxy-terminal deleted \u03b3-chain mutants retained on polysomes due to removal of the translation termination codon in the cDNA expression vector do not assemble with unlabeled holo \u03b1 chains. However, the two amino acid-deleted \u03b3 chains coded from vectors lacking a stop codon only assembled with \u03b1 chains after puromycin-induced polysome release. In addition, small amounts of radiolabeled \u03b1 \u03b3 dimers were detected on polysomes in reactions using wild type \u03b3-chain templates only when excess unlabeled \u03b1 chains were present. Together, our results suggest that Hb F formation is enhanced by a stable pool of free \u03b1 chains that interact with newly synthesized \u03b3 chains, either before or soon after their release from the ribosome and prior to formation of stable \u03b32 homo-dimers.",
