    "abstract_text": "Celularity, Inc. is developing a CD19 CAR-T Cell therapy using an allogeneic platform derived from postpartum human placental cells. T cells isolated from placenta/ umbilical cord blood and genetically modified to express CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), termed Placental-derived (P-) CD19 CAR T cells, are in development for the treatment of B cell malignancies. Unlike adult peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived T cells, P-T cells are mostly na\u00efve (CD45RA+) and can be readily expanded while maintaining an earlier differentiation phenotype such as greater expression of na\u00efve/ memory markers, lower expression of effector/ exhaustion markers, allowing for greater proliferative potential of these cells ex vivo . These cells are also known to have greater immune tolerance to HLA mismatch and display impaired allogeneic activation, contributing to lower incidences of severe graft-verse-host disease (GvHD) (Barker, et. al. Blood, 2001; Chen, et al . Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, 2006), making them an attractive cell population for use as an allogeneic, adoptive cell therapy. A robust process for the isolation, transduction, and expansion of placental-derived T cells to generate \"off-the-shelf\" allogeneic P-CD19 CAR T cells was developed. Twenty-One day expanded, non-modified P-T cells (N=3) were compared to adult PBMCs for their allo-reactivity in a Xenogeneic GvHD model in NCG mice. P-T cells did not induce xeno-GvHD whereas PBMCs did, as evidenced by significant weight loss and death of all mice (N=5) by Day 28 post infusion. Despite expanded P-T cells demonstrating lack of in vivo GvHD, current manufacture of P-CD19 CAR T cells does include a CRISPR-mediated T-cell receptor a constant (TRAC) knockout (KO) step as an additional risk-mitigation strategy to circumvent any potential GvHD stemming from expression of endogenous T cell receptor. CD19 CAR transduction using a retrovirus provided by Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., followed by TRAC knockout with CRISPR results in both high efficiency of CD19 CAR expression (~30% CD19 Fc+) and TCR KO (>96% CD3-/ TCR a/b-). In vitro , the functional activity of P-CD19 CAR-TRAC KO T cells against CD19+ Burkitt's Lymphoma (Daudi) and Acute lymphoblastic Leukemia (NALM6) cell lines was assessed in cytotoxicity and cytokine release assays. P-CD19 CAR T cells specifically lyse CD19+ Daudi/ Nalm6 targets in both 4-hour endpoint FACS and ACEA kinetic cytotoxicity assays, and in most cases at levels equivalent to or greater than PBMC-derived CD19 CAR T cells. When P-CD19 CAR T cells were co-cultured with CD19+ Daudi/ Nalm6 target cells for 24-hours, they secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines and effector proteins in an antigen-specific manner. In vivo , the anti-tumor activity of P-CD19 CAR T cells was assessed using a disseminated lymphoma xenograft model in NSG mice. Luciferase expressing Daudi cells (3\u00d710 6 ) were intravenously (IV) injected on Day 0, followed by IV injection of P-CD19 CAR T cells (14\u00d710 6 ) on Day 7. Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI) and survival were used as primary study endpoints. P- CD19 CAR T cells were well tolerated and safe. P-CD19 CAR T cells significantly reduced tumor burden, and improved survival. Four weeks after treatment, the vehicle group had a 100% mortality rate, while all animals from P-CD19 CAR T-treated group (N=5) remained alive without clinical symptoms including weight loss or changes in their fur. In summary, Celularity has defined a robust process for the generation and expansion of CD19 CAR T cells from human placenta. These cells exhibit potent anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo with little evidence of acute GvHD induction, highlighting their potential as an allogeneic, adoptive cell therapeutic agent. Future in vivo GvHD studies will include assessment of both CD19 CAR and TRAC KO genetically modified P-T cells.
