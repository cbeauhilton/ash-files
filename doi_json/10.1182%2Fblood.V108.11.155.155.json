    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with normal karyotype comprises a large number of molecularly distinct variants. For example the presence of internal tandem duplications (ITDs) of the FLT3 ( fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ) gene is associated with poor outcome, whereas mutations of the NPM1 ( nucleophosmin ) gene are prognostically favorable. However, this effect is mainly attributed to the NPM1 -mutated/ FLT3 ITD-negative AML cases. While NPM1 -mutated cases are characterized by a distinct gene expression pattern, it remains unclear whether NPM1 -mutated/ FLT3 ITD-negative cases also display a characteristic signature, which might provide additional insights into the molecular basis for the good clinical outcome. Thus, we sought to identify a molecular profile for AML cases with NPM1 -mutated/ FLT3 ITD-negative normal karyotype disease. Towards this goal, we profiled gene expression of 138 samples of adult AML patients with normal karyotype using DNA microarray technology. All samples analyzed were derived from AML patients entered within the randomized multicenter treatment trial HD-98A of the German-Austrian AML Study Group (AMLSG). Based on supervised data analyses we were able to identify a 116-genes comprising expression pattern correlated with NPM1 -mutated and FLT3 ITD-negative AML cases. In accordance with previous findings in NPM1 -mutated cases (Alcalay et al. 2005, Verhaak et al. 2005), the NPM1 -mutated/ FLT3 ITD-negative pattern was also in part characterized by a prominent HOX gene cluster, which clearly separated the NPM1 -wildtype from the NPM1 -mutated cases. Similarly, the expression levels of BAALC and MN1 were correlated with the NPM1 mutational status, with NPM1- unmutated cases displaying higher BAALC and MN1 expression in our data set. However, as expected the newly defined signature also defined a NPM1 -mutated group that did not contain many FLT3 ITD-positive samples. This group was characterized by several interesting genes including for example TLE1 , which encodes a Groucho/TLE family protein. Groucho/TLE family proteins are transcriptional co-repressors, which mediate repression essential in embryonic development and are involved in regulation of Wnt signaling in adult tissue. Moreover, we identified several other genes of potential pathogenic relevance which also have been previously shown to be predictive in normal karyotype AML. Our findings support a distinct molecular mechanism associated with the favorable outcome of NPM1 -mutated/ FLT3 ITD-negative AML cases. Furthermore, the reported signature might contribute to improved risk stratification and clinical management of AML patients with normal karyotype disease."
