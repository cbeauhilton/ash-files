    "abstract_text": "Background: Our previous work confirmed that serotonin (5-HT) promotes the proliferation of hemopoietic stem cells and megakaryocytes (Yang M et al, Stem Cells, 2007; 2014). However, the mechanisms remain indefinite. Methods: Q-PCR, Flow Cytometry, Western Blot, or Immunofluorescence microscope were used in the receptor and TPO study. MTT/CCK-8, Proplatelet assay, and Flow Cytometry were also used in cell proliferation and apoptosis study. The relationship between 5-HT and TPO was studied in a traumatic stress mice model. Results: In-vitro study, there was a stimulating effect of 5-HT on proplatelet formation in human bone marrow megakaryocytes. Human BM MK progenitors cultured in serum-free medium with either 5-HT (200nM) or TPO (100 ng/ml) had more proplatelet bearing MKs than the control group (5-HT (12.3 \u00b1 5.0)% vs. Control (6.2 \u00b1 3.5)%, P =0.025; TPO (15.6 \u00b1 2.5)% vs. Control, P =0.04; n=4). The 5-HT treatment group showed more mature and more in the final stage MK cells as compared to the TPO group. 5-HT2A, 2B, 2C receptors were detected in the surface of megakaryocytes. The effect of 5-HT on proplatelet formation in MK cells was via 5-HT2 receptors and this effect was reduced by 5-HT2 receptor inhibitor ketanserin. 5-HT acted on cytoskeleton reorganization in MKs via 5-HT2 receptors and ERK1/2 pathway. Using an immunofluorescence microscope with F-actin specific binder rhodamine-phalloidin staining, the polymerized actin level was lower in the control group than the 5-HT group and actin distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, the polymerization actin level was higher in the 5-HT group. Adding ketanserin and ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 to 5-HT treatment, the fluorescence intensity was correspondingly reduced. Our data also demonstrated that ERK1/2 was activated in MKs treated with 5-HT for 30 minutes. In a traumatic stress mice model, both of 5-HT and TPO were increased, but the increasing of TPO is posterior to 5-HT. After added LX1606, the synthesis inhibitor of 5-HT, 5-HT was reduced markedly, as well as TPO. The expression of TPO mRNA and the production of TPO protein were increased as compared with the control in this model. Conclusions: This study suggests that 5-HT promotes thrombopoiesis from two aspects: one is the direct effect on megakaryocytes. 5-HT could promote the proplatelet formation from megakaryocytes. The second is the indirect effect by promoting the production of TPO, which is a paracrine secretion to influence thrombopoiesis. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
