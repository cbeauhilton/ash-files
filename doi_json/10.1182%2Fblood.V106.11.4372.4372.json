    "abstract_text": "B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL) is a rare disease, originally described in the early seventies and now recognized as a specific entity by the WHO classification. Diagnosis is based on clinical features and lymphocyte morphology (>55% circulating prolymphocytes), as no specific immunophenotypic or cytogenetic marker is available. According to WHO, cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with increased prolymphocytes (CLL/PL) (>10% and 4 different algorithms. Prediction analysis for microarray (PAM) and significance analysis of microarray data (SAM) were used to evaluate class performance, and to partition genes using a priori defined labels of morphology, immunophenotype and cytogenetics. Unsupervised analysis reproducibly partitioned samples into two homogeneous distinct groups, corresponding to the diagnoses of B-PLL and CLL. SAM analysis identified 3957 differentially expressed transcripts (false discovery rates 77% of which showed an over 2-fold difference in expression between the groups. PAM analysis refined a sub-group of 46 genes which most efficiently differentiated the two diseases. Differentially expressed genes included those encoding surface antigens, oncogenes, transcription factors, adhesion molecules or involved in cell cycle/cell proliferation, lipidic metabolism and catalytic protein activity. Comparison of CD5 positive (13) versus CD5 negative (7) cases and cases with (7) or without (13) del(p53) showed no reliable class prediction. Our study formally demonstrates that B-PLL and CLL are two distinct diseases, each showing a specific gene expression. B-PLL has a homogeneous genomic profile irrespective of its heterogeneity in laboratory features. Validation of a model based on the expression of few genes predictive of diagnosis is on going. Further analysis of these data may also identify specific genes involved in B-PLL pathogenesis and drug resistance.",
