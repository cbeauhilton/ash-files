    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1774 A growing body of literature supports the concept that at least a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cell-receptors (BCRs) are reactive with antigens exposed on apoptotic cells. Work done in the autoimmunity field suggests that through their BCRs, autoreactive B cells can internalize RNA and DNA-containing autoantigens, thereby activating endosomal Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR9, respectively, with subsequent TLR-mediated signaling, proliferation and cytokine secretion. cAMP signaling modulates inflammatory signaling in immune system cells and our prior studies have shown that PKA, EPAC and CREB-mediated cAMP signaling can be potently induced in CLL cells with inhibitors of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) PDE4 family in the absence of additional exogenous stimulators of adenylate cyclase. We therefore examined the ability of PDE4 inhibitor-mediated cAMP signaling to regulate TLR7 and 9-mediated signaling in CLL cells. Treatment of CLL cells with the TLR7 and 9 agonists R848 and CpG-B oligonucleotide, respectively, induced IRAK1 degradation and activation of three signaling pathways known to be downstream of TLR7 and 9: the transcription factors NFkB and IRF5 as well as the MAP kinase JNK. The prototypic PDE4 inhibitor rolipram inhibited R848-induced TLR7 and CpG-B-induced TLR9 signaling in CLL cells as judged by Western analysis and immunofluorescent studies of NFkB and IRF5 nuclear translocation as well as JNK phosphorylation. Rolipram also blocked R848 and CpG-B-induced CLL proliferation and TNF secretion. In contrast, rolipram augmented R848 and CpG-B-induced CLL IL-10 synthesis, in keeping with prior studies documenting cAMP response elements in the IL-10 promoter. To test whether RNA and/or DNA antigens exposed in apoptotic cells might induce proliferation in CLL cells through BCR-mediated internalization and subsequent activation of TLR7 and TLR9, we irradiated CLL cells and added them in a graded fashion to live autologous CLL cells. Such exposure to irradiated cells undergoing apoptosis drove CLL proliferation in a manner that was sensitive to TLR7 and TLR9 antagonists, IRAK4 kinase inhibitors and the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram. Our work supports the concept that BCR and TLR-driven responses to apoptotic RNA and DNA-containing complexes may drive proliferation in CLL cells and that PDE4 inhibitors and other agents that target TLR signaling may prove to be effective therapeutic agents in this disease.
