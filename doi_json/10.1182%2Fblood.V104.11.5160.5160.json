    "abstract_text": "A total of 216 cases of matched and mismatched-haploidentical HCT from family donors have been performed since May 2002 in our Institute. The purpose of this analysis is to compare the GvHD, relapse rate and their risk factors for complications and survival. The feasibility of the present regimen can then be evaluated. In the arm of mismatched-haploidentical HCT, GIAC regimen (G-CSF priming hematopoietic cells collection; immunosuppression intensified and prolonged; ATG being used; combination use of BM + PB) was used for the first time. It was developed for patients without HLA matched related or unrelated donors. However, in HLA matched HCT, ATG was not used. The two groups were comparable in disease diagnoses, sex, and prophylaxis of GvHD, number of MNC/kg and use of G-CSF post-transplant. The great majority of recruited patients had hematological malignancies. A few were cases of SAA. There were significantly more patients in advanced stage or in high-risk status in mismatched-haploidentical HCT group. After median value of 9(2\u2013260 months follow up, the results are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Survival and causes of Death (2-year Kaplan-Meire Estimates)  Characteristics and Outcomes . Matched .
