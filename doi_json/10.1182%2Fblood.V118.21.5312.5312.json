    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5312 Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have increased risks of endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis. Systemic inflammation may contribute to the endothelial dysfunction and accelerated thrombosis observed in CKD patients. von Willebrand factor (VWF), a well-known index of endothelial damage, has been reported to increase both in CKD and inflammatory states. ADAMTS13 is a specific VWF-cleaving protease, and some reports suggested that the ratio of VWF and ADAMTS13 maybe more useful in the diagnosis and treatment evaluation of patients in the prothrombotic state. So we assessed the relationships among endothelial dysfunction, ADAMTS13 activity, and levels of inflammatory cytokines in CKD patients. CKD patients were classified into 3 groups: chronic glomerulonephritis group (CGN, n = 31), idiopathic nephritic syndrome group (NS, n = 32), and lupus nephritis group (LN, n = 41). We measured the plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1, VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), and ADAMTS13 activity by using an ELISA-based method in CKD patients (n = 104) and normal controls (n = 32). The ratio of the VWF:Ag level to ADAMTS13 activity was calculated. The VWF:Ag level was significantly higher and the ADAMTS13 activity was significantly lower in all the disease groups than in the controls (P < 0.01). ADAMTS13 activity was lower in the NS group than in the CGN and LN groups (P < 0.05) ( Table 1 ). The TNF-\u03b1 (pg/mL) level was higher in the CKD group than in the control group (CGN: 3.19 \u00b1 1.01; NS: 3.26 \u00b1 1.18; LN: 3.24 \u00b1 1.24; Control: 2.27 \u00b1 1.23; P < 0.01; P < 0.01). TNF-\u03b1 was positively correlated with the VWF:Ag level (r = 0.242, P = 0.013) and negatively correlated with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (r = \u22120.193, P = 0.049). ADAMTS13 activity was negatively correlated with the cholesterol level in CKD patients (r = \u22120.2, P = 0.042). TNF-\u03b1 level in CKD was positively correlated with the VWF:Ag level and negatively correlated with GFR, which suggests that inflammation might be a major cause of endothelial dysfunction and an index for renal function. The VWF:Ag level increased and ADAMTS13 activity decreased in CKD patients, which indicates that CKD leads to a prothrombotic state. Table 1.
