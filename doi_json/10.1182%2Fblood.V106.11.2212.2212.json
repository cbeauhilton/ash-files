    "abstract_text": "Reciprocal Interactions of NK cells with Dendritic Cells (DC) can induce activation of NK cells, maturation or lysis of DC and influence subsequent adaptive immune responses. However, little is known about the interaction of peripheral blood monocytes with NK cells, especially regarding involved immunoregulatory surface molecules. Here we report that monocytes express ligands for the activating immunoreceptor NKG2D expressed on NK cells upon treatment with various stimuli. Incubation of monocytes with TNF, GM-CSF, IFN-g and various TLR ligands (LPS, Pam3Cys, R848, PolyI:C) induced surface expression of the NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) MICA and to a lesser extent MICB, but no relevant changes of ULBP molecules, as determined by FACS analysis. Expression was confirmed by quantitative PCR analysis of NKG2DL mRNA induction. To elucidate the functional consequences of NKG2DL expression on monocytes for NK cell functions we performed coculture assays of monocytes and autologous NK cells. NKG2DL expression on stimulated monocytes lead to a significant induction of IFN-g release into the culture supernatant by NK cells as determined by ELISA. This IFN-g release was blocked by addition of a NKG2D-Ig fusionprotein, but not by isotype control demonstrating that the induction of NK cell IFN-g production was in fact specifically due to NKG2DL expression on monocytes. Since both monocytes and NK cells rapidly migrate to sites of inflammation, and monocytes display a high plasticity regarding their function and maturation which is influenced by IFN-g, our data indicate that NKG2DL expression on monocytes might not only mediate reciprocal activation of NK cells and monocytes but also might influence other components of the innate and adaptive immune system and thereby determine the course of subsequent immune reactions."
