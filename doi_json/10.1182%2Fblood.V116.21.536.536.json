    "abstract_text": "Abstract 536 Introduction: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are B-cell malignancies of different postulated origin, genetics, clinical presentation and prognosis. Several studies have reported that both MCL and CLL individually exhibit aberrant methylation in comparison to normal B-cells. However, a comprehensive comparison of the methylation profiles of these two B-cell disorders has not been performed yet. This strategy has the potential to identify cellular pathways and genes that are specifically targeted in each disease. Methods: We applied the genome-wide Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array (Illumina, San Diego, USA) which measures methylation levels at 27,578 CpG dinucleotides covering 14,495 genes, to compare the methylation profiles in: (i) 20 MCL cases; and, (ii) 30 CLL cases, 15 each with unmutated stereotyped subset #1 (IGHV1-5-7/IGKV1(D)-39) B cell receptors (BCRs) or mutated stereotyped subset #4 (IGHV4-34/IGKV2-30) BCRs, where these two subsets represent prototypes of unmutated and mutated CLL. The methylation status for each detected CpG site ranged between 0.1 (completely unmethylated) to 1 (completely methylated). Results: As expected, major differences in methylation patterns between MCL and CLL were observed. When the methylation profiles of the two entities were compared, 51 genes were identified as differentially methylated in all comparisons (MCL versus both CLL subsets combined and each subset separately). Among the 19 genes highly methylated in MCL were six (32%) homeobox or homeodomain-containing transcription factors (e.g. POU4F1, PITX3 ), whereas genes enhancing cell proliferation and tumor progression such as MERTK and CAMP were hypomethylated in MCL. Of the 32 genes hypermethylated in CLL were six pro-apoptotic genes, including DYRK2 and CYFIP2 , the tumor suppressor PRDM2 and the cell cycle regulator CCND1. Conclusions: We report for the first time disease-biased methylation profiles for different functional classes of genes in MCL or CLL. Homeobox genes were highly methylated in MCL, whereas CLL was characterized by methylation of apoptosis-related genes. The identified differences in global methylation profiles between MCL and CLL may assist in unfolding distinct epigenetic silencing mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of these B-cell malignancies.
