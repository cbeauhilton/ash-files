    "abstract_text": "Human blood flowing over monolayers of endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro under controlled flow conditions constitutes a promising model of blood-EC interactions, especially in a system permitting real-time imaging of single platelets (1 \u03bcm resolution or better) and platelet aggregates. We have developed such a model and have used it to study platelet adhesion/aggregation on monolayers of human renal microvascular ECs grown on optically clear vinyl slides and activated with TNF\u03b1 (20 ng/ml; hr 0 to 22) and Shiga toxin-1 (Stx; 10 pM; hr 18 to 22), in simulation of probable events in the childhood hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Normal donor blood, collected into 4U/ml low MW heparin (dalteparin) and 10 \u03bcM mepacrine (platelet, EC, and granulocyte label), was drawn at shear rates of 270\u2013650 sec \u22121 through a parallel-plate flow chamber for which one wall was one of the above slides. Such shear rates give rise to shear stresses which approximate the 20\u201325 dynes/cm 2 estimated to exist in glomerular arterioles. Platelets, ECs, and granulocytes were imaged in real time using epifluorescence digital videomicroscopy. With activated, but not with control ECs, clusters of platelets deposit on the monolayers in strings (Fig.1, upper right, with flow from top to bottom) superposed upon ECs, for which the cytoplasm is fluorescent. The strings are tethered at the upstream end, as has been observed by others using platelet-rich plasma. Granulocytes, identifiable by size (Fig. 1, upper middle), also adhere to activated ECs. In five paired experiments, monolayer preincubation \u00d7 30 min with 50 nM active-site inactivated recombinant factor VIIa (ASIS; courtesy of Dr. Ulla Hedner, Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals) largely eliminated the platelet strings, while reducing the number of adherent granulocytes to zero. In control experiments, preincubation of monolayers with 100 nM of a monoclonal antibody directed against human tissue factor similarly largely eliminated both platelet strings and adherent granulocytes. In other control experiments, the use of the above concentration of low MW heparin did not by itself block fibrin formation (by immunostaining) in the boundary region near the slide-blood interface. These findings may be explained on the basis that ASIS both interrupts the tissue factor pathway of coagulation and blocks tissue factor-associated upregulation of endothelial cell E-selectin. ASIS therefore may have promise as a therapy for the prothrombotic and proinflammatory effects of childhood HUS. Studies with the TAB monoclonal antibody and ALEXA 555 are in progress to permit platelet-specific labeling and quantitation of platelet adhesion/aggregation with and without ASIS.
