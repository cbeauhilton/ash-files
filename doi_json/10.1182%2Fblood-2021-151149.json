    "abstract_text": "Introduction : In the general HIV negative population, patients (pts) with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or high grade B cell lymphoma (HGBCL) carrying MYC rearrangements and BCL2 and/or BCL-6 translocations [double hit (DHL) or triple hit lymphomas (THL)] have shown a dismal prognosis when treated with standard R-CHOP and are frequently candidates to intensive therapeutic regimens, without having a standard of care. Moreover, several authors have demonstrated a negative prognostic impact of isolated MYC rearrangements [single hit lymphomas (SHL)] and the best therapeutic approach for SHL are even less clear. In HIV-associated \"non Burkitt\" large B cell lymphomas (Ly), scanty data are available on the prevalence and the clinical and prognostic impact of MYC rearrangements, with or without BCL2 and BCL6 concomitant translocations. Due to the peculiar biology and pathogenesis of HIV-associated Ly, data from HIV negative population cannot be simply translated to the HIV positive pts. Aim : To evaluate the impact of MYC rearrangements or translocations (isolated or with BCL2 and/or BCL6 translocations) on clinical features and outcome of HIV-associated large B cell Ly. Methods : Retrospective analysis of clinical characteristics, treatment received and outcome of all HIV-associated large B cell Ly [including DLBCL, B cell Ly unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt (BCLU), and HGBL] with MYC rearrangements or translocations, evaluated by FISH analysis, in 11 European centers, and comparison with pts who do not have the MYC alterations. Results : One hundred-sixty-one pts were enrolled, 49 (30%) had MYC translocation or other MYC rearrangements (MYC+ pts), and 112 (70%) were negative for MYC mutation (7 pts had MYC increased copy number) (MYC- pts). Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of the two groups, and the treatment received. MYC+ pts had higher involvement of central nervous system at presentation (17% vs 3%, p 0,023), higher Ki67% (median 91% vs 85%, p 0,005), histology other than DLBCL (32% vs 9%, p 0,0001), concomitant translocation of BCL2 (14% vs 3%, p 0,022), germinal center B phenotype (according to Hans algorithm) (85% vs 49%, p 0,0001). No differences in CD4 count or HIV viral load at Ly diagnosis were found, while a previous diagnosis of AIDS was more frequent in the MYC- group (27% vs 10%, p 0,023). MYC+ pts received more frequently intensive treatment (iCT) (41% vs 12%, p 0,0001) and less frequently the standard CHOP regimen (41% vs 74%, p 0,001). Ten pts (9%) had a DHL/THL and had similar clinical characteristics compared to SHL. With a median follow-up of 62 months, there were no significant differences in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between MYC+ and MYC- pts (5 years-OS and PFS were respectively 55% and 47% in MYC+ and 59% and 53% in MYC- pts). In univariate analysis for the whole population, IPI\u22653, ECOG\u2265 2 and increased LDH were related to a worse OS and PFS while BCL2 translocation correlated with shorter PFS alone. In multivariate analysis ECOG and IPI mainteined their negative prognostic impact on OS and PFS. In the MYC+ group, 41% pts received R-CHOP or CHOP-like treatment (group 1), 16% infusional therapy (group 2), 41% iCT (group 3), 2% palliative therapy (PT) (group 4); 5-years OS and PFS were 47% and 32% for group 1, 47% and 37% for group 2, 67% and 68% for group 3 and both 0% for group 4. Median OS and PFS were respectively 18 and 2 months for group 1, 29 and 7 months for group 2, both not reached for group 3, both 2 months for group 4. A significant difference between group 3 and group 1 both in therm of OS ( p 0,054) and PFS ( p 0,005) was observed (Figure 1). Pts with DHL/THL received R-CHOP (40%), infusional schedule (30%), iCT (20%) and PT (10%). No significant difference in term of PFS and OS were observed for each treatment group with DHL/THL respect to those with SHL. In DHL/THL, 5 years OS and PFS were 50% and 30%, respectively; in SHL 56% and 51%, respectively. Of note, no pts treated with iCT died from toxicity in the MYC+ group. Conclusion : In this retrospective analysis, MYC+ pts had not different clinical characteristics compared to MYC- pts other than higher proliferative index and and more CNS involvement at diagnosis. MYC+ pts were frequently treated with iCT, this aggressive approach seemed feasible and could allow to obtain better outcome compared to standard R-CHOP treatment but further prospective studies are needed.
