    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1141 Cyclic nucleotides have an important role in platelet aggregation and the role of phosphodiesterases in regulating their concentration is well known. Currently it is unknown if plasma membrane cyclic nucleotide export proteins regulate cyclic nucleotide concentrations in platelets. The ATP-binding cassette transporter, ABCC4 functions as a cyclic nucleotide exporter that is highly expressed in platelets. However, its role as a cyclic nucleotide transporter in platelets is unknown, because it was reportedly localized intracellularly in the platelet dense granules. This original report (Jedlitschky, Tirschmann et al. 2004) evaluated ABCC4 localization by immune-fluorescence of platelets after attachment to collagen coated coverslips. However, collagen attachment activates platelets causing mobilization and fusion of alpha and dense granules to the plasma membrane, thus rendering conditions that distinguish between plasma membrane and dense granules almost impossible. To resolve this problem we isolated the platelets under conditions that minimize activation during isolation. Subsequently, these platelets membranes were labeled with the cell impermeable biotinylating agent (EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC Biotin). Analysis of total platelet lysate detected the dense granule marker, P-selectin and Abcc4. However, after precipitation of the plasma membrane with streptavidin-beads, we detected only Abcc4. This indicates Mrp4 is at the plasma membrane. We confirmed Abcc4 localization by confocal microscopy on platelets that were treated with a monoclonal antibody specific to Abcc4. Evidence that Abcc4 regulates cyclic nucleotide levels under basal conditions was then provided by the findings that Abcc4 -null platelets have elevated cyclic nucleotides. We further used the Abcc4 -null mouse model to explore the role of Abcc4 in platelet biology. The Abcc4 -null mouse does not have any change in the platelet or dense granules number compared to the wild type mouse. Platelet activation in vivo can be initiated by interaction with collagen through the GPVI receptor that is expressed at the plasma membrane of the platelets. At the molecular level, the initiation of platelet activation by collagen results in an increase in the cyclic nucleotide concentration and phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) which can attenuate aggregation. To determine the Abcc4 role in this process we exposed Abcc4 -null platelets to collagen and discovered that these platelets have impaired activation in response to collagen. However, Abcc4 -null platelets activated by thrombin or ADP, which activate either G-coupled PAR receptors or P2Y12 receptor respectively, show an aggregation profile almost identical to wildtype platelets, thus indicating the defect in Abcc4 -null platelet aggregation is specific to the collagen initiated pathway. To understand the basis for the impaired aggregation of Abcc4 -null platelets, we examined VASP phosphorylation after collagen treatment, and discovered that the cyclic nucleotide dependent phosphorylation of VASP (Ser 157) is elevated in the Abcc4 -null platelets. These results strongly suggest that Abcc4 -null platelets have impaired GPVI activation by collagen due to elevated cyclic nucleotide concentrations. Based on these studies we conclude that Abcc4 plays a critical role in regulating platelet cyclic nucleotide concentrations and its absence or perhaps inhibition (by drugs) impairs the aggregation response to collagen. Because many antiplatelet drugs are potent inhibitors of Abcc4 (e.g., Dipyridamole and Sildenafil) these findings have strong implications for not just the development of antiplatelet drugs, but also for understanding the role of Abcc4 in regulating intracellular nucleotide levels.
