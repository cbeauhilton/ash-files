    "abstract_text": "Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia is a B-cell disorder characterized by the infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells (LPC) in the bone marrow (BM), along with an IgM monoclonal gammopathy. Characteristic of WM is an increased number of mast cells (MC) which are found in association with LPC, and stimulate LPC growth through several TNF-family members including CD40L, APRIL and BLYS ( Ann Oncol  17 : 1275 ; Blood  104 : 917A ). As such, we have targeted MC in WM. One important growth and survival factor for MC is stem cell factor (SCF), which signals through CD117. Imatinib mesylate blocks SCF signaling through CD117, and induces apoptosis of WM BM MC and LPC, both of which highly express CD117 ( Blood  2004 ; 104 : 314b ). As such, we performed this Phase II study of imatinib mesylate in patients with relapsed and refractory WM. Intended therapy consisted of imatinib mesylate which was initiated at 400 mg po qD over the first month, and subsequently dose escalated to 600 mg po qD for up to 2 years. Dose de-escalation to 300 mg po qD was permitted for toxicity. Thirteen patients were enrolled and are eligible for evaluation at interim analysis. Median age was 64 (range 53\u201380 years), and median prior therapies was 2 (range 1\u20135). Nine and four patients had relapsed and refractory disease, respectively. Following a median of 3 months of therapy, median serum IgM levels for all evaluable patients declined from 3190 (range 763\u20138130 mg/dL) to 2095 (range 695\u20137340 mg/dL) at best response (p=0.009). On an intent to treat analysis, 6/13 (46.2%) of patients attained a \u226525% decrease in serum IgM. Responses were prompt, and occurred at a median of 2.5 months. Overall, therapy was well tolerated with \u2265grade 2 toxicities as follows: anemia (n=4); edema (n=3); hyperglycemia (n=2); leukopenia (n=2); thrombocytopenia (n=1); neutropenia (n=1); and resulted for 4 patients in dose modification (n=4) or treatment cessation (n=3). The interim results of this study demonstrate that imatinib mesylate is an active and well-tolerated salvage therapy for WM."
