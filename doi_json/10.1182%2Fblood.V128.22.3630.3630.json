    "abstract_text": "Introduction and Objectives: Iron overload in patients with Thalassemia Major (TM) leads to various complications including liver fibrosis. The independent impact of gender on this risk has been previously investigated but not yet confirmed. We, therefore, planned to assess the independent impact of gender in patients with TM on the risk of liver fibrosis. Methods: We included 96 patients with TM followed and transfused in one academic tertiary hospital. Patients underwent assessment of liver fibrosis using ultrasound elastography (FibroScan device) with a cut off value of 7.8 kPa. The mean ferritin in the 5 years prior to elastography assessment was used to represent iron overload. Association was tested using Chi-squared and the independent impact of gender was confirmed in the multivariable logistic regression with a model that included mean ferritin and gender. Results: The median age of the 96 included patients was 26 years (Interquartile range [IQR]: 22-30). Males constituted 45% of patients and 33% of patients were splenectomised. The median alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, albumin and total bilirubin were 30 U/L (IQR: 18-64), 30 U/L (IQR: 18-46), 46 g/L (IQR: 44-48) and 21 \u00b5mol/L (IQR: 14-32) respectively. The median ferritin and liver iron concentration assessed by MRI T2* were 1293 \u00b5g/L (IQR: 753-2715) and 6.7 mg/gdw (IQR: 3.5-16.1) respectively. Thirty seven percent of patients had positive serology for HCV while 1% of patients had positive serology for HBV. The proportion of patients with fibrosis as assessed by elastography was 59%. The proportion of male patients with fibrosis was 70% compared to 51% in female patients with a trend towards statistical significance (odds ratio [OR] of 2.2 with a p value of 0.094). In the multivariable logistic regression model, both gender (OR of 3.0, P value of 0.0188) and ferritin (OR of 1.0004, p value of 0.0036) were statistically significant independent predictors of liver fibrosis. Conclusion: Male gender increases the risk of liver fibrosis independent from iron overload. Our study confirms the previously suspected but unproven association. Follow up and therapy may be tailored to include gender as a decision factor. Larger studies are needed to further confirm these results. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
