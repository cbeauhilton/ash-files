    "abstract_text": "Introduction: ACH-4471 is an oral complement factor D (fD) inhibitor that has demonstrated clinical efficacy in an ongoing phase 2 clinical study for na\u00efve patients suffering from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH is a rare clonal blood disorder in which erythrocytes lacking the GPI-anchored complement regulators CD55 and CD59 are susceptible to destruction by the terminal complement complex (also known as membrane attack complex, MAC) following the normal low-level activation of the complement alternative pathway (AP) in the fluid phase. The therapeutic agent eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the terminal complement component C5, blocks MAC assembly on erythrocyte membranes and so prevents most intravascular hemolytic destruction. Eculizumab treatment however leads to increased deposition of complement C3 fragments on PNH membranes, which can result in extravascular phagocytic elimination of opsonized erythrocytes (A. M. Risitano et al, Blood, 2009, 113:4094) and incomplete inhibition of intravascular hemolysis (M. J. Harder et al, Blood, 2017, 129:970), and consequently to the continued anemia and transfusion dependence observed in a significant subset of patients. As an AP inhibitor, in contrast to eculizumab, ACH-4471 prevents both MAC assembly and C3 fragment deposition on PNH cell surfaces and therefore is expected to address the medical needs of these suboptimal responders to eculizumab. To assess this notion directly and also to support a future switch treatment approach, a further clinical study has been planned to evaluate ACH-4471 co-administration in PNH patients who respond suboptimally to eculizumab. In the present study, we conducted in vitro combination experiments to explore the potential pharmacological consequences when ACH-4471 is added on to eculizumab or another anti-C5 monoclonal antibody, using functional AP assays that include the hemolysis of erythrocytes from a PNH patient. Methods: Concentration series of ACH-4471 were assessed in pairwise combinations with eculizumab and a second monoclonal antibody inhibitor of complement C5. Functional assays for human serum AP activity included a single-plate ELISA-based functional assay (Wieslab) and the hemolysis of red blood cells from a PNH patient under AP-restricted conditions but at neutral pH. Analyses of interactions were performed using a three-dimensional surface graphing method and, where applicable, a median-effect plot method. Results: We assessed pairwise interactions using two assays for AP function. In the AP Wieslab assay, interactions between ACH-4471 and an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody ranged from additive to moderately synergistic. Next, to better approximate the physiological setting, we assessed inhibitor interactions against the AP-mediated hemolysis of red blood cells obtained from a PNH patient. ACH-4471 in this assay showed strongly synergistic interactions when tested with eculizumab. In light of a recent report on incomplete inhibition by eculizumab following strong complement activation, we propose a possible mechanism for synergy between ACH-4471 and eculizumab wherein ACH-4471 reduces the density of deposited C3b clusters, to which C5 binding is thereby more readily inhibited by eculizumab. Conclusions: ACH-4471 showed strong synergy with eculizumab. These results suggest the potential clinical utility of ACH-4471 as a PNH therapeutic agent that may be used in suboptimal eculizumab responders in support of a \"switch\" treatment strategy.
