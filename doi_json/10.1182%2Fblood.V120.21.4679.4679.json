    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4679 The aims of this study are transfection of tumor suppressor miR-150 that is down-regulated in leukemogenesis into leukemia cells mediated by Polyethylene Glycol - Polyethylenimine (PEG-PEI) nanoparticle and determine the changes in gene expression pattern in chronic myeloid leukemia model cell lines; K-562 and KU812 and non-leukemia cell lines NCI-BL2347 and NCI-BL2171. Characterization studies and stability studies of PEG-PEI copolymers were performed and by using these copolymers 9 nanoparticle formulations were prepared. Three copolymers (named T1, T3 and T9) were eligible for further analysis and nanoparticle complex (named F1, F2 and F3) formulations, particles that their size less than 300 nM have been evaluated. Nanoparticle-mediated substitution of miR-150 reduced the expressions of cell cycle control genes CDK2 and CCNG2, CDK6 7-fold and 2-fold, respectively in K562 leukemia cell model. Nanoparticle-mediated substitution of miR-150 has been evaluated KU812 leukemia cell model and reduced the expression of cell cycle control genes CHEK2, CDK5RAP1 and CCNG2 and CDKN1A 6- fold 5 \u2013fold and 2-fold, respectively. Substitution of deregulated tumor suppressor miR-150 to leukemia cells with non-viral transfection yielded promising results for the treatment of leukemia. Taking into account these results, it should be supported by preclinical studies in animal models, which would add benefit to current treatment protocols in clinical application.
