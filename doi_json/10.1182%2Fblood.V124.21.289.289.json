    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is characterized by Reed Sternberg (RS) cells surrounded by an extensive but ineffective inflammatory/immune cell infiltrate. Recent studies suggest that Hodgkin RS cells have developed mechanisms that exploit the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) pathway to evade immune detection. In cHL, chromosome 9p24.1 gain is a frequent structural alteration that increases the gene dosage of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2 , and their induction via JAK/STAT signaling. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection also increases the expression of the PD-1 ligands in EBV-positive cHL. Ligand binding to PD-1 receptor-positive activated T cells induces \u0093T cell exhaustion,\u0094 a reversible inhibition of T cell activation and proliferation. Nivolumab (BMS-936558, Bristol-Myers Squibb) is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal PD-1 blocking antibody that potentiates anti-tumor T cell activity, and exhibits clinical efficacy in several solid tumors. We hypothesized that nivolumab may augment anti-tumor activity in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) cHL, including those who had failed brentuximab vedotin (BV), and evaluated the PD-1 blocking antibody. These are the first analyses being reported with PD-1 antibody for the treatment of cHL. Methods: Patients with R/R cHL were included as an independent cohort in a dose escalation and cohort expansion phase I study of nivolumab in lymphoma and multiple myeloma (MM). Results for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and MM are reported separately. Patients with cHL received nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks until confirmed tumor progression or excessive toxicity. Responses were evaluated using standard criteria. The primary endpoint was safety; key secondary endpoints included anti-tumor activity and expression of immunomodulatory proteins in tumor biopsies. Results: Twenty-three patients were enrolled with R/R cHL. Patients were heavily pre-treated, 87% had received \u2265 3 prior treatment regimens, 78% had prior autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), and 78% had prior BV treatment. Drug-related adverse events (AEs) of any grade occurred in 78% of patients, the most common of which were rash (22%), decreased platelet count (17%), diarrhea, nausea, pruritus, fatigue, and pyrexia (each at 13%). Drug-related grade 3/4 AEs occurred in 22% of patients. Three patients experienced 1 serious AE each (grade 3 myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS], grade 3 pancreatitis, and grade 2 lymph node pain). The objective response rate (ORR) was 87% (20/23), with 4 patients (17%) achieving a complete response (CR) and 16 (70%) obtaining a partial response (PR). The remaining 3 patients (13%) had stable disease (SD). All 23 patients had a reduction in tumor burden at 1 or more efficacy assessments during treatment with nivolumab (Figure). Among the 18 patients who had previously failed BV, the ORR was 89% (16/18), with 6% (1/18) achieving CR and 83% (15/18) PR. Progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 24 weeks was 86% (95% CI, 62-95%). The median overall survival (OS) has not been reached (range, 21+ to 75+ weeks). Six of 23 patients elected to discontinue study treatment to undergo stem cell transplantation, 2 patients discontinued due to toxicities (MDS and thrombocytopenia in 1 patient; pancreatitis in 1 patient), 4 patients discontinued due to disease progression, and 11 patients continue on study as of June 16, 2014. In a subset of study patients (10/23), PD-L1 and PD-L2 copy numbers in RS cells were assessed using fixed tumor biopsy specimens and a 3-probe fluorescence in situ assay ( PD-L1, PD-L2, and control centromeric probe). In all tumors, RS cells had copy gains of PD-L1 and PD-L2 , as a result of either polysomy or amplification; these tumors also exhibited increased protein expression of PD-L1. RS cells were also largely positive for pSTAT3, indicative of active JAK/STAT signaling. Conclusions In patients with R/R cHL, nivolumab-mediated PD-1 blockade is safe and tolerable with a safety profile similar to that in solid tumors. The frequent and long-lasting responses in heavily pretreated, R/R patients, including those who have failed BV, highlight the importance of the PD-1 pathway in cHL, and the genetically defined sensitivity to PD-1 blockade in this disease. Based on these results, the FDA granted nivolumab breakthrough status in relapsed cHL and a large, multinational, phase II trial of this therapy is underway.
