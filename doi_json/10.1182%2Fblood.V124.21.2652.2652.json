    "abstract_text": "Objective: Patient report of symptom burden from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is scarce. Symptom burden is the combined impact of symptoms from disease and treatment on daily functioning. We are developing a measure of symptom burden in AML and MDS. The purpose of this interim analysis is to compare the symptom burden of patients with AML and MDS. Methods: Patients with AML or MDS rated the 13 core symptom items, 6 proposed AML/MDS-specific symptom items, and 6 interference items of the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory on a 0-10 scale (0 = not present or no interference; 10 = as bad as can be imagined or complete interference). Patient clinical and demographic information was collected from medical records. The symptom burden of AML/MDS was determined and compared using descriptive statistics and t-tests. Results: Mean ages of the 45 AML patients and 48 MDS patients were 62.4 (standard deviation [SD] = 11.3) and 68.5 years (SD = 9.2; p = 0.005), respectively; 61% and 60% ( p = not significant), respectively, were male; 76% and 92% ( p = 0.043), respectively, were white. The composite mean severity score of the core symptom items was 2.75 (SD = 1.58) and 1.84 (SD = 1.52; p = 0.006), the composite mean of the AML/MDS specific items was 2.51 (SD = 1.87) and 1.49 (1.60; p = 0.005), and the composite mean score of the interference items was 3.96 (SD = 2.72) and 2.81 (SD = 2.69; p = 0.042) for the AML and MDS patients, respectively. The means, ranks, significance of difference in ratings, and prevalence of the individual symptom and interference items for the AML and MDS patients are in Table 1. Cronbach \u03b1 for all symptom items was 0.94 and for all interference items was 0.92. Conclusions: Patients with AML and MDS experience similar symptoms. However, patients with AML report significantly more severe pain, fatigue, nausea, lack of appetite, dry mouth, vomiting, fever, and headache than patients with MDS. Only prevalence of shortness of breath and diarrhea was higher in MDS patients, but there was no difference in reported mean severity of these symptoms. Except for general activity, rating of symptom interference with daily activities is similar for the two groups. Lack of recognition of symptoms experienced by patients with AML and MDS can lead to inadequate management of symptoms, interfere with patients' ability to function and enjoy life, and impact the tolerability of and adherence to treatment regimens. Validation of this measure of symptom burden for patients with AML and MDS to allow more accurate and consistent monitoring of symptoms by clinicians and in clinical research is ongoing. Table 1.
