    "abstract_text": "Pitx2, a homeodomain gene preferentially expressed in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, is also a downstream target of genes important for hematopoiesis such as MLL and Wnt/Dvl/\u03b2-Catenin. We have previously reported that Pitx2 null hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can contribute to multi-lineage hematopoiesis under physiologic conditions. We have now carried out serial bone marrow transplantation experiments and demonstrated that after the 3 rd round of serial transplantation, Pitx2 null cells reconstituted only 28.6% of the recipient hematopoietic cells as compared to 60% in the case of wild type cells (P<0.001). There were no Pitx2 null donor-derived cells in recipient mice after the 4 th round of transplantation, whereas donor-derived chimerism was 57% with wild type cells (P<0.001), and 26% with Pitx2 +/\u2212 cells (P<0.001). Therefore, Pitx2 null HSCs have decreased self renewal capacity. To further study the function of Pitx2 in HSC, we constitutively overexpressed the Pitx2 gene in murine bone marrow cells following transduction using a MSCV/IRES/GFP retroviral vector, and analyzed the effects on hematopoiesis in vitro and in vivo. Bone marrow cells overexpressing Pitx2 were isolated on the basis of their GFP expression and analyzed for their colony forming ability in vitro. Retrovirally transduced bone marrow cells were also transplanted into lethally irradiated mice, and the transplanted mice were observed for long-term reconstitution. Colony-forming unit assays showed that Pitx2 overexpressing bone marrow cells, compared to control cells transduced with vector only, had increased numbers of GM colony forming units and reduced numbers of megakaryocytic colony forming units. Pitx2-overexpressing cells continued to form GM colonies after more than eight serial replatings. When these cells were cultured in liquid medium containing SCF, IL-3 and IL-6, they gave rise to cells that stained positively either for alpha naphthyl butyrate, indicating monocytic differentiation, or for peroxidase, indicating neutrophilic differentiation. The ability of these GM-colony forming cells to cause leukemia is currently under investigation. Long-term reconstitution of hematopoiesis in mice by Pitx2 over-expressing HSCs was demonstrated by identifying GFP positive multi-lineage peripheral blood cells four months following transplantation. One of these mice manifested leukemia at this time, as evidenced by a markedly elevated WBC count and other hematologic abnormalities. The leukemic WBCs had very high levels of GFP and Pitx2 expression and were shown to contain two retroviral integration sites, neither of which involved a known oncogene or overexpression of the gene at the integration site. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry demonstrated that the majority of the leukemic cells were c-kit positive and expressed the megakaryocytic marker CD41, as well as the common myeloid progenitor marker, CD16/32. Some of the cells expressed the erythroid marker Ter119. The leukemic cells did not express any lymphoid markers, including CD3\u03b5, B220, CD19, and IL7R3. This Pitx2-overexpression-associated leukemia was transplantable. Experiments are under way to characterize the leukemia initiating cells. Taken together, our results provide evidence that the homeodomain gene Pitx2 plays a role in the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.",
