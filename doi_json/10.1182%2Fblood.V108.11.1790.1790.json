    "abstract_text": "Recent reports have utilized a variety of cell types for cellular therapy in mediating therapeutic angiogenesis in response to ischemia. We sought to assess the vasculogeneic potential of selected CD133 + hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from umbilical cord blood (UCB) utilizing in vitro functional assays and an in vivo murine hind-limb ischemia model. Methods & Results: Mononuclear cells (MNC) from UCB or bone marrow (BM) were incubated with CD133 + conjugated magnetic beads, followed by automated sorting through magnetic columns (Miltenyi). Routine yield of CD133 + cells was 0.5\u00b10.2% of UCB MNC and 0.7\u00b10.3% of BM MNC, with a purity of 79\u00b12% (UCB, n=30) and 84\u00b15% (BM, n=12). Surface expression in the UCB CD133 + population was 3.6\u00b11.5% KDR(VEGFR2), 8.7\u00b1 3.8% CXCR4 and 22.7\u00b12.8% CD105 compared to 9.2\u00b11.8% KDR, 14.4\u00b11.3% CXCR4 and 23.7\u00b12.3% CD105 in the BM CD133 + population. We measured chemotactic migration of cells towards SDF-1 (100ng/mL) compared to control wells containing media alone. The fold increase over control was 4.9\u00b12.9 UCB MNC, 1.8\u00b10.7 UCB CD133 + and 8.3\u00b11.7 BM CD133 + (n=3). Angiogenic protein assays of CD133 + cells demonstrated elevated levels of IL-8 production as compared to MNC (10 3 +/\u2212380 pg/mL greater in CD133 + than MNC from the same UCB unit) when cultured for 24h in basal media. NOD/SCID mice underwent ligation of the right femoral artery and were given cells or vehicle control via intracardiac injection immediately following injury. Mice were given 1 x 10 6 MNC or 0.5 x 10 6 CD133 + cells. Laser Doppler flow measurements were obtained from both limbs each week for 6 weeks and the ratio of perfusion in the ischemic/healthy limb was calculated. At 28 days, perfusion ratios were statistically higher in study groups receiving UCB CD133 + cells, 0.55\u00b10.06 (n=9), BM CD133 + cells 0.47\u00b10.07 (n=8), BM MNC 0.48\u00b10.8 (n=6) compared to cytokine controls 0.37\u00b10.03 (n=12, p<0.05). Mice receiving UCB MNC did not show statistically significant improvement in measured blood flow over control animals 0.42\u00b10.05 (n=8, p=0.34). At sacrifice, bone marrow was harvested to assess engraftment of human cells by flow cytometric analysis. Mice injected with UCB CD133 + cells showed 19\u00b14.9% positive huCD45 cells compared to 2.5\u00b10.6% for UCB MNC, 1.6\u00b10.4% for BM CD133+ cells and 2.3\u00b10.3% for BM MNC (n=3). Histological studies from day 42 tissue samples of muscle distal to arterial ligation were evaluated for capillary density. Control animals had capillary density of 131\u00b16.9 cells/mm 2 . Capillary density was statistically higher that controls in animals receiving UCB CD133 + (320\u00b118; p<0.0001), BM CD133 + + (183\u00b19.3; p<0.0001), and UCB MNC (164\u00b110.5; p=0.011). Mice treated with BM MNC (135\u00b19.4) did not have a statistically significant increase in capillary density from controls (p=0.73). In addition, animals treated with either UCB or BM-derived CD133 + cells had statistically higher capillary density than unselected MNC (p=<0.0001 and p=0.0004, respectively). Conclusions: In vitro functional assays showed that UCB-derived CD133 + HSC demonstrate enhanced homing capability (migration) as well as the potential for cellular recruitment (via IL-8 production) for angiogenesis in response to ischemia. Furthermore, UCB derived CD133 + HSC mediate significantly improved blood flow in an in vivo murine hind-limb injury model of ischemia, indicating the greater vasculogenic potential of selected CD133 + cells from of this stem cell source."
