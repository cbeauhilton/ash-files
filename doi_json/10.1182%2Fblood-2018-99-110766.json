    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION Idelalisib (IDELA), the first-in-class PI3K-delta inhibitor, is indicated in Europe in combination with rituximab (R) or ofatumumab for the treatment (tt) of adult patients (pts) with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy, or as first-line tt of pts with 17p deletion (del(17p)) or TP53 mutation ( TP53 m), not eligibles for any other therapies and as monotherapy for pts with follicular lymphoma (FL) refractory to two prior lines of tt. IDELA has significant clinical activity with a manageable safety profile. However, there is a paucity of real word data regarding its effectiveness and safety. The REALIST study was initiated to better describe pts who started IDELA treatment during the French Early Access Program (EAP). AIMS The aim of this retrospective multicenter study was to describe efficacy, adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), AEs of special interest (AESIs, defined as diarrhea/colitis, pneumonitis, liver enzyme elevation, neutropenia, infection, and rash) and IDELA use in adult pts previously enrolled in the French EAP for CLL or iNHL. METHODS All Investigators who enrolled at least one pt in the EAP were contacted by email inviting them to participate in this study. Only pts who initiated IDELA tt between June and October 2014 have been included in this study. For each pt, 12 months (m) follow up data were collected via an electronic Case Report Form and monitored by the Lymphoma Academic Research Organization (LYSARC). The Primary endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR) at 6 m and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Statistical analysis was descriptive. RESULTS Seventy-five pts were included, 41 in CLL group (39 in third-line or late and 2 in first-line with del(17p)/TP53m unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy (CIT)) and 34 in iNHL group, all refractory after two prior lines of tt. Table 1 lists key pt characteristics at the time of initiation of IDELA. In CLL/iNHL groups respectively, median IDELA tt duration was 25.1 weeks/18.9 weeks, ORR, was 82.8%/56.5% at 6 m (data reported in 29 pts/23 pts) and 100%/57.1% at 12 m (data reported in 12 pts/14 pts), median PFS was not reached (NR)/ 6.7 m, median time to next tt (TTNT) defined as the time between the date of the last IDELA intake and the start of next tt after progression of disease (PD) was NR/11.6 m, median OS was NR in both groups and OS estimate at M12 was 69.9%/67.6%. Additional efficacy data are presented in Table 2, Fig 1 and Fig 2. In CLL/iNHL groups respectively, at least one AE was reported during the study in 35 pts (85.4%)/26 pts (76.5%), most frequently reported AEs by SOC/PT were: infections and infestations 61.0%/50.0% ( pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) 2.4%/5.9%), gastrointestinal disorders 56.1%/35.3% (diarrhea 41.5%/29.4%), blood and lymphatic system disorders 41.5%/41.2% (neutropenia 17.1%/23.5%) and investigation 43.9%/47.1% (hepatic enzyme increase 19.5%/14.7%). 24 pts (58.5%)/15 pts (44.1%) discontinued temporary IDELA, 6 pts (14.6%)/8 pts (23.5%) discontinued permanently for AE, 38 pts (92.7%)/25 pts (73.5%) had at least one AESI, 10 pts (24.4%)/11 pts (32.4%) had at least one serious AESI, 3 pts (7.3%)/6 pts (17.6%) permanently discontinued IDELA for AESI and deaths were reported during the study in 13 pts (31.7%)/11 pts (32.4%), mainly due to PD (46.2%/72.7%). CONCLUSION The results of this non-Interventional study of heavily pretreated CLL and iNHL population treated by IDELA monotherapy or in combination with rituximab indicate that IDELA is an effective treatment in routine clinical practice with an acceptable safety profile. ORR at 6 months was 83% in CLL full analysis set and 79% in del(17p)/TP53m sub-group and 55% in FL sub group. These results mirror those of clinical trials. No unexpected IDELA safety information was identified in this study and the pattern of AEs corresponds to that reported in previous clinical studies and might be improved by specific management of AESI including PJP prophylaxis to be administered to all patients throughout IDELA treatment.
