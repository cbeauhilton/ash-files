    "abstract_text": "Introduction. We aimed to prospectively assess if the male gender was associated with an higher risk of progressive cardiac iron accumulation, development of biventricular dysfunction and myocardial fibrosis assessed by CMR, and development of cardiac complications including heart failure (HF), arrhythmias and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Methods. We considered 1711 TM patients (899 females, 31.09\u00b19.08 years), consecutively enrolled in the Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassemia (MIOT) Network. Myocardial iron overload was assessed by the multislice multiecho T2* technique. Biventricular function was quantified by cine images. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images were acquired to detect myocardial fibrosis. Results. Although having a similar risk of accumulating iron, males showed a significant higher risk of developing cardiac dysfunction, heart failure, arrhythmias and cardiac complications globally considered (Table 1). Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier curves for the outcomes for which the male sex was a significant prognosticator. Until 20-30 years of follow-up the two lines (male and female sex) were almost overlapping while after they clearly diverged. So, patients were divided in two groups based on the follow-up duration. A significant gender-specific difference in the frequency of ventricular dysfunction and cardiac complications appeared for patients followed for at least 20 years. So, two subgroups of patients were identified: patients followed for less than 20 years and patients followed for more than 20 years. In the first subgroup males and females had a comparable risk of developing cardiac iron overload, ventricular dysfunction and cardiac complications. Conversely, if a follow-up longer than 20 years was considered, males exhibited a significant higher risk of having ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac complications. Conclusion. Females seem to tolerate iron toxicity better, possibly as an effect of reduced sensitivity to chronic oxidative stress. According to the International Guidelines, TM patients should perform a complete cardiac evaluation every year. Our study suggested that in females older than 20 years the follow-up may be performed every 24 months, thus reducing health care costs.
