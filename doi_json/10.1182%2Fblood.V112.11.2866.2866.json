    "abstract_text": "The platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is the prototypic example of regulated integrin function. Thus, \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is present in a resting conformation on unstimulated platelets, but switches to an active conformation following platelet stimulation. Recent experiments suggest that disrupting a heteromeric interaction between the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains shifts \u03b1IIb\u03b23 from its resting to its active conformation. However, structural information about the heteromeric interaction is sparse. Thus far, the structure of the TM heterodimer has only been studied by molecular modeling. Interactions between soluble cytosolic tail peptides have been studied by NMR spectroscopy, but these studies may not reflect native contacts because they fail to account for constraining TM domain interactions. To obtain an NMR structure for the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 cytosolic tail heterodimer that reflects its native structure, we expressed 13C- and 15N-labeled peptides corresponding to \u03b1IIb residues 988\u20131008 and \u03b23 residues 713\u2013762 in E. coli. Residues 987 in \u03b1IIb and 712 in \u03b23 were replaced with cysteines, based on modeling that predicts the resultant disulfide bond will fix the peptides in their native orientation. Crosslinked heterodimers were dissolved in dodecylphosphocholine micelles at pH 6.5 and analyzed at 37\u00b0C on a 750 MHz NMR spectrometer. Previously, we presented a preliminary analysis of this construct indicating that when constrained by the proximal disulfide bond, the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 cytoplasmic tails interact and the cytosolic tail of \u03b23 consists of three helices. We have now solved the final structure which defines the \u03b23 interface that interacts with the \u03b1IIb cytoplasmic tail. The \u03b1IIb-\u03b23 heterodimer interface is dynamic, but can be localized to \u03b23 residues 716 and 719 because they have different chemical shifts in the crosslinked heterodimer than they do in the component monomers. This positions \u03b23 residue 723 at the \u03b1IIb-\u03b23 interface, consistent with the putative Arg995-Asp723 salt bridge. Interestingly, the \u03b1IIb tail is natively unstructured so a static interface for \u03b1IIb could not be identified. Additionally, the completed structure defines the relative orientations of the three \u03b23 helices. The \u03b23 cytoplasmic tail contains a sharp kink at residue 724 that fixes the membrane embedded helix (residues 713\u2013723) and the first cytoplasmic helix (residues 725\u2013736) at a right angle. The kink was defined by multiple NMR parameters including NOE distance restraints between residues 721 and 727. The distal cytoplasmic helix (residues 746\u2013757) is related to the rest of the molecule by a flexible loop (residues 737\u2013 745). N15 NOESY-HSQC crosspeak intensities provide evidence that the flexible loop and distal helix undergo increased motion relative to the first two helices, and the final structure reflects this motion because there is no preferred orientation for the distal helix relative to the first two helices. Lastly, the distal helix and flexible loop are joined by \u03b23\u2019s canonical NPXY motif which forms an N-terminal cap for the distal helix. In conclusion, we have solved the NMR structure of a disulfide-crosslinked \u03b1IIb/\u03b23 cytoplasmic tail heterodimer. Our analysis indicates that, when constrained by a disulfide bond, the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 cytoplasmic tails interact, providing one mechanism for maintaining \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in a resting state.",
