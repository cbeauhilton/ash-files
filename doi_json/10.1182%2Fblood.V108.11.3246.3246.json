    "abstract_text": "The presentation of leukemic antigens can be improved in AML and MDS by in vitro conversion of leukemic cells in leukemia-derived DC (DC leu ), thereby forming a platform for the generation of leukemia-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL). In preliminary analyses with 140 AML and 60 MDS-cases we could already define optimal serum-free culture conditions to generate DC/DC leu .(Kufner 2005 I\u2013III). Now we want to predict or correlate the clinical response to a DC/CTL-based immunotherapy by detailed analyses of the ex vivo generated/activated DC/DC leu and T-cells: 1)By a combination of 3 different DC-generating methods (\u2018MCM-mimic\u2019, Lee 2003; \u2018Ca-Ionophore\u2019, Houtenbos 2003; \u2018Picibanil\u2019, Sato 2003) we can generate DC/DC leu in every case of AML/MDS, independently from FAB-type or karyotype. DC/DC leu are quantified according to their surface DC/blast-marker profiles. On average 42\u201345%/39\u201366% DC in AML/MDS could be generated with 48\u201354%/39\u201351% mature (CD83+) and 31\u201334%/23\u201331% migratory (CCR7+) DC. 45\u201365% of DC were \u2018DC leu \u2019; on average 47% of blasts are convertible to DC leu. . 2) In AML-patients who had presented with a relapse after SCT we could correlate a better ex vivo convertibility of blasts to DC leu with the patients\u2019 in vivo response to a GM-CSF/Donor-lymphocyte Infusion (DLI)-therapy of their relapse after SCT (33% vs 7% to DC leu convertible blasts in \u2018non-responders\u2019). 3) A \u2018Mixed lymphocyte culture\u2019 (MLC) of autologous AML-patients\u2019 or allogeneic donor-T-cells showed an on average higher proliferation and stimulation of DC-primed compared to MNC-primed T-cells: Upregulation of CD80/CD86-CD28;CD40-CD154;CD137L-CD137; moreover DC-priming yielded higher proportions of CD4+ cells, CD3+CD45RO+ memory cells CCR4+ T-cells (+59%, +52%, +91%) compared to MNC-primed T-cells (+35%, +13%, +44%) and a higher leukaemia-cytolytic activity (average 62%) compared to MNC-stimulated CTL (average 26%). 4) A detailed analysis of data showed great individual variations depending on the quality and composition of DC and T-cells: a) non-DC-primed autologous or allogeneic T-cells an lead to an increase of naive blasts after 3h incubation with blasts b) in cases with an ineffective DC-mediated ex vivo lysis of nai\u0308ve blasts lower proportions of mature DC (29% vs 63%), DC leu (41% vs 68%) or a reduced T-cell proliferation or even loss of CD4/CD8/memory T-cells were seen. In summary our data show 1. that DC/DC leu can be generated in every single AML/MDS-case. 2. Grade of ex-vivo generability of DC/DC leu correlates with the in vivo response to a GM-CSF/DLI-relapse therapy. 3. Composition and quality of DC and autologous or donor T-cells after DC-priming provides informations about the activability and quality of CTLs in individual patients. We conclude, that ex vivo analysis of the DC/anti-leukemic T-cell-activability is necessary to develop and select promising anti-leukemia-directed T-cells for the immunotherapy of AML and MDS.",
