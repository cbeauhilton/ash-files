    "abstract_text": "Within the bone marrow, three hematopoietic stem cell niches have been identified; the osteoblastic niche (Arai et al., 2004; Calvi et al., 2003; Nilsson et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2003), the vascular niche (Kiel et al., 2005), and the CAR cell niche (Sugiyama et al., 2006). The adhesion molecule N-cadherin has been found associated with the osteoblastic and CAR cell niches, implicating N-cadherin\u2019s function for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) anchoring and signaling (Arai et al., 2004; Muguruma et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2003). However, as of yet, a HSC population expressing N-cadherin has not been fully characterized. Therefore, we examined how N-cadherin expression in HSCs relates to their function and lifecycle. Unexpectedly, we found that doses of 5000 bone marrow cells expressing the highest level of N-cadherin (N-cadherin hi ) failed to reconstitute hematopoietic lineages in irradiated recipient mice. An explanation for this engraftment failure came with detailed cell surface phenotyping which revealed that these N-cadherin hi cells were primarily Lineage + and devoid of the characteristic hematopoietic stem pool, Lineage-Sca+cKit+ (LSK) cells. Instead, we found that Flk2-LSK HSCs express a gradient of N-cadherin which could be described as low (N-cadherin lo ) to intermediate (N-cadherin int ) levels (Figure1). FACS applications were used to isolate pure populations of these N-cadherin lo and N-cadherin int Flk2-LSK HSCs. Real time RT-PCR (N-cadherin primers crossed the intron between Exon 2 and 3). (Figure 2), microarray studies, and competitive reconstitution transplantation assays revealed that this N-cadherin division of Flk2- LSK HSCs formed two populations with very distinct properties. In transplantation assays the N-cadherin lo population more robustly reconstituted the hematopoietic system. Principle Component Analysis and gene ontology analysis of microarray data revealed that the N-cadherin lo cells expressed genes that may prime them to respond to signals and to mobilize. This data was confirmed with mobilization studies which showed that HSCs mobilized from bone marrow to spleen were predominantly N-cadherin lo . In contrast, the expression profile of N-cadherin int cells suggests they are more \u2018reserved\u2019 and this population was also maintained with HSCs spared by 5-fluouracil (5FU) treatment. Our results suggest that differential N-cadherin expression reflects important functional distinctions between HSC subpopulations. N-cadherin lo HSCs, with their robust reconstitution efficiency and properties similar to mobilized HSCs, may have clinical relevance.
