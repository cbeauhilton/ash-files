    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1828 Introduction: Intact immunoglobulin or fragments thereof (intact/fragmented Ig) can be found in the urine due to nephrotic injury or the preferential scavenging of albumin by the renal FcRn receptor leading to immunoglobulin catabolism. Until now the occurrence, frequency and clinical impact of this phenomenon has not been assessed in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Here we determine the incidence of intact/fragmented Ig in urine and evaluate its prognostic relevance. Patients and Methods: 94 patients with MM, median age 70 years old (range 41\u201387) with a male / female ratio 28/66, ISS stage I (48), stage II (23), stage III (28), 69 IgG (43 IgGk/26 IgGl) and 25 IgA (15 IgAk/7 IgAl) were enrolled. Serum free light chain concentrations (sFLC) were measured using commercially available immunoassays (Freelite\u2122, The Binding Site, Birmingham, UK) and compared to electrophoresis results (Hydrasys, Sebia, Paris, France). Overall survival was estimated by the product limiting method of Kaplan-Meyer and survival was compared by the log rank test. Results: Overall, sFLC ratios had a greater sensitivity than urine immunofixation (uIFE) for the detection of monoclonal light chains 86/94 vs. 46/94. In 13/46 (28%) uIFE positive patients intact immunoglobulins or significant fragments (intact/fragmented Ig) thereof were detected, 12 IgG, (12/69, 17%) and 1 IgA (1/25, 4%). Three of these patients had normal urine protein concentrations (<250mg/L) and 2/13 patients had glomerular injury identified by increased levels of albumin excretion. There was no difference in creatinine levels between patients with or without intact/fragmented Ig (p=0.673). Analysis of overall survival in patients stratified at presentation according to uIFE results, namely the presence of intact/fragmented Ig, abnormal serum free light chain ratio-, and negative uIFE results revealed significantly shorter overall survival for the intact/fragmented Ig group (median OS: 34.5 vs. 66.0, vs. 80.6 months, respectively, p< 0.048) ( figure 1 ). Discussion: Our findings confirm the superiority of the serum free light chain assay for detection of monoclonal free light chains as compared to urine immunofixation. However, the serum free light chain assay is inadequate for detection of intact/fragmented Ig in urine. The most important finding presented here is the observation that intact and/or fragment immunoglobulin is present in a substantial number of patients with MM. This phenomenon is mainly restricted to IgG isotypes. There are two possible explanations for these findings: first, the presence of glomerular injury, but this phenomenon (increased albumin leakage) was only seen in two patients and hence is unlikely to account for this observation. The second explanation relies upon disruption of the FcRn receptor function in immunoglobulin scavenging. This receptor will preferentially scavenge albumin in the renal setting, but dysfunction may lead to increased immunoglobulin catabolism and the presence of intact and/or fragmented Ig (Sarav, JASN, 20: 1941\u20131952, 2009). The results may reflect a hitherto unidentified subtle renal dysfunction. In line with this notion overall survival in our patients intact/fragmented Ig was found to be significantly shorter. Conclusion: We observed an unexpected high incidence of intact/fragmented Ig in the urine of our patients with MM. Patients with urinary excretion of intact/fragmented immunoglobulin had significantly shorter survival. These findings should be validated in further studies.
