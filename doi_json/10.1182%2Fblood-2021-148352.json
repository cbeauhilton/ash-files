    "abstract_text": "Background Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) comprises a heterogeneous group of T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with poor prognosis that are often refractory to treatment. Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and Janus kinase (JAK) signaling pathways are important tumor survival mechanisms in PTCL. Cerdulatinib (ALXN2075) is an orally active, small molecule, reversible ATP-competitive dual inhibitor of SYK/JAK family members. The efficacy and safety of cerdulatinib monotherapy were investigated in a multicenter, single-arm Phase 2a dose-expansion study (NCT01994382) of patients with T- or B-cell malignancies; we report the final results from the PTCL cohort. Methods Eligible patients in the PTCL cohort were aged \u226518 years and had histologically confirmed PTCL with relapsed/refractory disease after \u22651 prior systemic therapy (prior brentuximab was required for CD30+ patients) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status \u22641. Patients received oral cerdulatinib 30 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR) based on Lugano criteria. Secondary endpoints, including time to response (TTR), duration of response (DoR), and progression-free survival (PFS), were estimated. Efficacy was evaluated in patients who had \u22651 post-baseline scan. Safety was evaluated in all patients who received \u22651 dose. Results Overall, 220 patients (with various subtypes of B- and T-cell malignancies) were enrolled across 6 study cohorts. A total of 65 patients in the PTCL cohort received \u22651 dose of cerdulatinib and were included in this analysis: 63.1% male; median (range) age 65 (21-85) years; median (range) prior regimens 2 (1-10); 49.2% refractory to last treatment; 18 patients (27.7%) had prior stem cell transplant. Histologic types were angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma/T follicular helper (AITL/TFH [N=29; 44.6%]); PTCL not otherwise specified (NOS [N=11; 16.9%]); and other rare T-cell leukemias and lymphomas (N=25; 38.5%; Table 1). Of 65 patients with PTCL, 58 were evaluable for efficacy (Table 1). ORR was 36.2% (95% CI 24.0-49.9%) for the overall PTCL cohort (12 complete responses [CRs]; 9 partial responses [PRs]; 14 stable disease [SD]). For the AITL/TFH subgroup (N=27), ORR was 51.9% (95% CI 31.9-71.3%) (10 CR; 4 PR; 3 SD). ORR (95% CI) in the safety population was 32.3% (21.2-45.1%) for PTCL overall (N=65) and 48.3% (29.4-67.5%) for AITL/TFH (N=29). Median (range) TTR for AITL/TFH was 1.9 (1.5-16.5) months (first scan at 2 months). Median (range) DoR for AITL/TFH was 12.9 (0.0-35.5) months with median (range) follow-up of 16.4 (0-35.5) months. PFS for the AITL/TFH subgroup was estimated to be median (range) 4.6 (0.6-37.4) months with median (range) follow-up of 22.4 (0.6-37.4) months. Further assessment is warranted. Median (range) time on treatment for all patients was 2.9 (0.2-37.9) months for PTCL overall and 3.3 (0.5-37.9) months for AITL/TFH, which appears comparable to time patients spent on their last prior therapy (median 2.2 and 3.0 months, respectively). The most common (\u22655%) grade \u22653 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), excluding disease progression, were increased amylase (23.1%), anemia (20.0%), increased lipase (18.5%), neutropenia (12.3%), sepsis (9.2%), and diarrhea (7.7%). Increases in amylase and lipase were transient, reversible, and not associated with clinical pancreatitis. Adverse events were primary reasons for treatment discontinuation in 6 patients (9.2%) in the PTCL population (2 EBV reactivation, 1 West Nile viral infection, 1 sepsis, 1 infection, and 1 colitis). Conclusions Cerdulatinib demonstrated acceptable tolerability and clinical activity in PTCL. Complete and durable responses were observed in patients with the AITL/TFH subtype, including patients who had repeatedly relapsed and/or were refractory to their last treatment. These data provide proof of concept and a promising efficacy/safety profile for a first-in-class, dual SYK/JAK inhibitor in relapsed/refractory PTCL. Overall the benefit/risk profile of cerdulatinib treatment appears favorable in this population, with the exception of the PTCL NOS subgroup, in whom no responses were seen. This subtype-specific activity raises the potential for biomarker identification to optimize patient selection.
