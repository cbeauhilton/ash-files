    "abstract_text": "The acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a form of acute lung injury (ALI) unique to sickle cell disease (SCD), and for children >10 years of age represents the major cause of morbidity and mortality. ALI is thought to be neutrophil (PMN)-mediated; however, the pathogenesis of ACS is not known but is linked to an increase of secretory phospholipase A 2 -IIA (sPLA 2 ) activity within 24 hours of its development ( Styles, Blood  87 : 2573 , 1996 ). We hypothesize that sPLA 2 cleavage of membrane lipids generates biologically active lipophilic compounds that prime PMNs, which provokes ACS in patients with SCD, resulting in increased lipid priming activity during ACS. After obtaining informed consent, heparinized whole blood was drawn from children with SCD when well, at their annual comprehensive visit, and serially when admitted to the hospital, upon admission and every other day until discharge. Plasma was isolated, and the plasma lipids extracted. In selected patients the plasma was treated with buffer or sPLA 2 for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C prior to lipid extraction. Lipids were assayed for their ability to prime fMLP-activation of the PMN oxidase as measured by the maximal rate of O 2 \u2212 production by the SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm. The data (mean \u00b1 SEM of fold increase over fMLP-treated controls of the lipid priming activity at baseline and over hospitalization) consists of three groups: patients with SCD, patients with SCD treated with daily hydroxyurea (HU), or patients with SCD treated with monthly, red cell exchanges (EX). At baseline, there was slightly more lipid priming activity in untreated SCD patients versus either HU- or EX-treated patients, which was not statistically different (Table). The lipid activity did not increase with vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) but significantly increased in the one patient with ACS. Moreover, sPLA 2 treatment of the plasma obtained 12 hours prior to developing ACS, while this patient was in VOC, demonstrated an increase in lipid priming activity versus the patient\u2019s prior samples (0.96- to 1.73-fold control with sPLA 2 ). The lipids from healthy African-American patients, did not exhibit increased activity vs controls (data not shown). We conclude that both HU and EX therapies may diminish the baseline activity of plasma lipids as compared to untreated children with SCD. In addition, sPLA 2 -treatment of the plasma 12 hours prior to the devlopment of ACS increased the amount of bioactive lipids released. Moreover, the amount of lipid priming activity was significantly increased during ACS as compared to baseline and during VOC. These preliminary results support the concept that the pathogenesis of ACS involves sPLA 2 activity, which generates bioactive lipids that may provoke ACS, and need to be extended through the recruitment of more patients and completion of a multi-institutional trial.
