    "abstract_text": "Polyadenylation is a post-transcriptional modification where the 3' end of an mRNA is cleaved and 250-300 adenines are added. It is predicted that 70-75% of human genes have more than one polyadenylation sequence (PAS) and are subject to alternative polyadenylation (APA). APA events affect the coding sequence of a gene when a proximal PAS is located within an intron, constitutive exon, or alternative exon. Gene expression is also affected if there are multiple PAS within the distal 3' untranslated region (UTR); proximal PAS usage shortens the 3'UTR, which can remove cis-regulatory regions such as miRNA and RNA-binding protein (RBP) sites. Furthermore, global changes in APA are linked to cellular state-proximal PAS usage is associated with immature developmental phases, cell proliferation, and cancerous phenotypes. Consequently, APA is a pertinent post-transcriptional modification that regulates gene expression and isoform generation across developmental stages and tissue types. Despite its significance, there are few APA studies in the hematology field, and those that exist have focused on global shifts in PAS usage. In this study, we uniquely focus on the APA mechanism of a single gene, RUNX1 , and how this event can alter hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis and hematopoiesis. There are three main isoforms of RUNX1 that differ in promoter and/or PAS usage. RUNX1b/c use different promoters, but have identical C-terminal regions. RUNX1a utilizes the same promoter as RUNX1b, but differs from both RUNX1b/c due to usage of a proximal PAS located in alternative exon 7a. RUNX1b/c are robustly expressed in most progenitor populations and differentiated blood cell lineages, whereas RUNX1a is restricted to human CD34+ HSCs. Functionally, RUNX1b/c promote HSC differentiation and lineage commitment, whereas RUNX1a expands HSCs and their engraftment potential, a property with therapeutic advantages but leukemic potential. Due to the difference in expression pattern and distinct functionality of RUNX1a compared to RUNX1b/c, it is relevant to study the APA event that dictates isoform generation. Elucidating this mechanism could provide valuable insight into the transient control of the HSC population for therapeutic benefit and illuminate new leukemogenic pathways. To study RUNX1 APA, we cloned alternative terminal exon 7a (RUNX1a) and constitutive exon 7b (RUNX1b/c) in between the two exons of a split GFP minigene reporter, along with 500 bp of their upstream and downstream flanking introns. We hypothesized that exon 7a would be skipped during processing of the minigene construct because the proximal PAS is rarely used in vivo. Conversely, exon 7b, the penultimate exon in RUNX1b/c, would be spliced in between the GFP exons, disrupting the GFP protein. These constructs were tested in KG-1a and U937 cells. Flow cytometry for GFP fluorescence supported our hypothesis as the exon 7a minigene produced a robust GFP signal and the exon 7b minigene produced no GFP signal. We confirmed that the GFP changes were due to the hypothesized mRNA processing events by performing RT-PCR using primers specific to the two GFP exons. These data show that important cis-regulatory elements that determine RUNX1 APA are located within exon 7a, 7b, and the cloned intronic regions. Next, we altered these minigenes by strategically making chimeric constructs that consist of either exon 7a or 7b with all combinations of upstream/downstream flanking introns. We discovered that replacing the intron upstream of exon 7a confers 2-5 fold greater splicing and polyadenylation of exon 7a, indicative of RUNX1a isoform generation. Therefore, a suppressor cis-element is located in this upstream intronic region. However, placing this intron upstream of exon 7b is not sufficient to reduce its inclusion between the GFP exons. Instead, both the upstream and downstream intronic regions flanking exon 7a are required. This suggests an RNA-looping mechanism that prevents splicing and usage of the exon 7a proximal PAS. Cleavage factor (CFIm) and Polypyrimidine-tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) are RBPs involved in splicing and polyadenylation that alter mRNA processing by RNA-looping. We aim to narrow down the suppressor region upstream of exon 7a to identify a consensus sequence and the respective RBP that diminishes RUNX1 proximal PAS usage. This knowledge can be leveraged to enhance RUNX1a production and expand HSCs for therapeutic benefit. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
