    "abstract_text": "The anti-bleeding therapy recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is used to abrogate bleeding in hemophiliacs with inhibitors, bypassing the need for replacement factors. RFVIIa is hypothesized to work by increasing Xa generation on the platelet\u2019s surface. However, high plasma levels of rFVIIa are required, in part due to the weak binding of rFVIIa to platelets. We hypothesized that the efficacy of the therapy could be improved by administering rFVIIa already bound to platelets. One platelet preparative that may be used in this application is rehydrated, lyophilized (RL) platelets. RL platelets are fixed with paraformaldehyde, which allows them to be frozen and lyophilized while retaining their hemostatic capabilities. Previously, we have shown RL platelets are capable of supporting rFVIIa-mediated thrombin generation and that thrombin generation is increased in a rFVIIa dose-dependent manner ( Blood , 106 : 4057 , 2005 ). In this current study, we have characterized the ability of RL platelets to modulate rFVIIa-mediated thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation in a cell-based complete model of hemophilia. The addition of RL platelets with 50 nM rFVIIa increased the thrombin generation rate in hemophilia 2.8-fold more than 50 nM rFVIIa, alone. Further, the addition of RL platelets with 50 nM rFVIIa normalized clot formation and stability in a fibrinolytic environment, which did not occur in the presence of rFVIIa, alone. In contrast, the addition of RL platelets, alone, to hemophilic conditions had minimal to no effect on thrombin generation rate or the onset of clot formation, suggesting that the effects were due to a specific interaction between rFVIIa and RL platelets. When rFVIIa plus RL platelets were added to platelet-rich plasma from patients with hemophilia A in the presence of tissue-type plasminogen activator, clot formation and stability were improved more than the addition of either agent alone. To examine the mechanism of RL platelets\u2019 augmentation of rFVIIa activity, we titrated the phosphatidylserine (PS) binding protein, annexin V, into reactions with RL platelets in the presence of factors Xa, Va, and prothrombin and measured thrombin generation. The addition of annexin V reduced thrombin generation equally in reactions that contained RL platelets stimulated with or without SFLLRN. Further, thrombin generation was similar on RL platelets simulated with or without SFLLRN in the absence of annexin V. These data suggest that RL platelets already have PS exposed on their surface. We conclude that RL platelets can support rFVIIa-mediated thrombin generation in the absence of factor IX and may enhance rFVIIa activity in part due to PS exposure on the RL platelet surface. We hypothesize that co-administration of RL platelets with rFVIIa may increase the efficacy of rFVIIa, at lower doses of rFVIIa than are currently required to achieve hemostasis.",
