    "abstract_text": "T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL) is a clonal proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). T-LGLL mainly manifest in elderly and is associated with autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), B cell dyscrasias, non-hematologic cancers and immunodeficiency ( e.g ., hypogammaglobulinemia). LGL manifestations often resemble reactive immune processes leading to the dilemmas that LGLs act like CTL expansion during viral infections (for example EBV associated infectious mononucleosis). While studying a cohort of 246 adult patients with T-LGLL seen at Cleveland Clinic over the past 10 years, we encountered 15 cases of overt T-LGLL following transplantation of solid organs (SOT; n=8) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; n=7). Although early studies reported on the occurrence of LGL post-transplant, these studies focused on the analysis of oligoclonality skewed reactive CTL responses rather than frank T-LGLL. We aimed to characterize post-transplantation T-LGLL in SOT and HSCT simultaneously and compare them to a control group of 231 de novo T-LGLL (cases with no history of SOT or HSCT). To characterize an unambiguous \"WHO-defined T-LGLL\" we applied stringent and uniform criteria. All cases were diagnosed if 3 out of 4 criteria were fulfilled, including: 1) LGL count >500/\u00b5L in blood for more than 6 months; 2) abnormal CTLs expressing CD3, CD8 and CD57 by flow cytometry; 3) preferential usage of a TCR V\u03b2 family by flow cytometry; 4) TCR gene rearrangement by PCR. In addition, targeted deep sequencing for STAT3 mutations was performed and charts of bone marrow biopsies were reviewed to exclude other possible conditions. Diagnosis was made 0.2-27 yrs post-transplantation (median: 4 yrs). At the time of T-LGLL diagnosis, relative lymphocytosis (15-91%), T lymphocytosis (49-99%) and elevated absolute LGL counts (>500 /\u00b5L; 93%) were also seen. Post-transplantation T-LGLL were significantly younger than de novo T-LGLL, (median age: 48 vs. 61 yr; P <.0001). Sixty% of post-transplantation T-LGLL patients were males. Fifteen% of patients had more cytogenetic abnormalities compared to de novo T-LGLL, had a lower absolute LGL count (median: 4.5 vs. 8.5 k/\u00b5L) and had less frequent neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia (27 vs. 43%, 33 vs. 35% and 20% vs. 55%; P =.01). TCR Vb analysis identified clonal expansion of \u22651 of the Vb proteins in 60% (n=9) of the patients; the remaining 40% (n=6) of the cases had either a clonal process involving a Vb protein not tested in the panel (20%; n=3) or no clear expansion (20%; n=3). Signs of rejection were observed in 20% (n=3/15) and GvHD in 13% (n=2/15) of the patients. Post-transplantation, 27% of cases presented with neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1.5 x10 9 /L; n=4), 33% with thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 x10 9 /L; n=5) and 25% with anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dL; n=3). T-LGLL evolved in 10 patients (67%; 10/15) despite IST including cyclosporine (n=5), tacrolimus (n=4), mycophenolate mofetil (n=5), cyclophosphamide (n=1), anti-thymocyte globulin (n=1), and corticosteroids (n=6). Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly were seen in 13% (n=2) and 33% (n=5) of the patients. Other conditions observed were MGUS (20%; n=3) and RA (7%; n=1). Conventional cytogenetic showed normal karyotype in 89% (n=11, tested individuals 13/15). Somatic STAT3 mutations were identified in 2 patients. Sixty% of cases (n=9) were seropositive for EBV when tested at different time points after transplant. Similarly, 53% (n=8) were seropositive for CMV, of which, 5 were positive post-transplantation and 3 pre-/post-transplantation. The complexity of T-LGLL expansion post-transplantation might be due to several mechanisms including active viral infections, latent oncogenic viral reactivation and graft allo-antigenic stimulation. However, in our cohort graft rejection or GvHD was encountered in a few patients (2 allo-HSCT recipients). Autoimmune conditions were present in 50% of SOT recipients (n=4/ 8, including RA, ulcerative colitis, systemic lupus erythematosus). Some of our patients also had low immunoglobulin levels. Overt EBV (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder) and CMV reactivation was diagnosed in only 27% (4/15) of the patients. In sum we report the long term follow up of a cohort of T-LGLL and emphasize the expansion of T-LGLL post-transplant highlighting the difficulty in assigning one unique origin of LGLL.
