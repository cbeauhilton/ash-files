    "abstract_text": "Patients with hypercoagulability syndrome can have a wide variety of risk factors that predispose them to develop a thrombotic event. Factor VIII increased levels has been reported as one of these. In this retrospective study we report the frequency of increased levels of factor VIII activity found in patients referred for hypercoagulability assessment to our reference center. Material and methods Review of clinical and laboratory database of patients referred for hypercoagulability assessment. Results are presented as percentages. Results Of 323 patients with hypercoagulability syndrome, 98 (30.3%) had increased levels of Factor VIII activity, male-female ratio 1:1.8, mean age 49.8 \u00b1 15 y-o. Sixty (61.2%) patients had a venous thrombotic event and 73.3% of them had recurrence. Ten (10.2%) had an arterial thrombotic event and 23 a combined arterial and venous thrombosis with recurrent episodes of 70.0 and 82.6% respectively. Five patients had no clotting events. Thrombosis in unusual sites was found in 22 patients. Conclusion Increased levels of Factor VIII activity are found in 30.3 % of patients with hypercoagulability syndromes, almost two thirds develop a venous thrombotic event and recurrences occur in 75.3%.
