    "abstract_text": "Small cell volume or diameter (3\u20137\u03bcm) appears to be one of the characteristics that may be used to identify early stem cells. Hematopoietic stem cells may be characterized by the expression of cell surface markers such as CD34, CD117 and CD133. In addition, stem cells such as \u201cSP cells\u201d can be recognized by the efflux of dyes such as Hoechst 33342 and presence of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). In prior studies we used the Beckman Coulter\u00ae Cell Lab Quanta( \u2122 ) SC MPL analyzer to determine the electronic cell volume, diameter and marker expression (CD34, CD90, CD117 and CD133) of cells from peripheral blood apheresis (HPC, Apheresis) samples ( Shariatmadar et al. Cytometry B , 74B : 182 \u2013188, 2008 ; Sharma et al. Cytometry A , 73A : 160 \u2013167, 2008 ). In the present study, we used this analyzer to determine cell volume, diameter and marker expression of ALDH positive stem cells from HPC, Apheresis samples of 44 patients with hematologic malignancies mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. The mean electronic volume of the ALDH positive cells was 286\u03bcm 3 (SD\u00b127) corresponding to a diameter of 8.2\u03bcm. The mean percentage of ALDH positive cells analyzed was 0.51% (SD\u00b1 0.004). CD34 expression was seen in 0.13% (SD\u00b10.001) of the ALDH positive cells. The mean electronic volume of the ALDH and CD34 positive cells was 270\u03bcm 3 (SD\u00b1 33) corresponding to a diameter of 8.0\u03bcm. CD133, CD117 and CD90 expression was seen in 0.28% (SD\u00b1 0.01), 0.17 (SD\u00b1 0.05) and 0.04% (SD\u00b1 0.03) of the ALDH positive cells. The mean electronic volume of the ALDH positive cells with CD133 expression was 275\u03bcm 3 (SD\u00b129) corresponding to a diameter of 8.1\u03bcm while that of the ALDH positive cells with CD117 and CD90 expression was 284\u03bcm 3 (SD\u00b1 32) and 265\u03bcm 3 (SD\u00b1 35), corresponding to a diameter of 8.15 and 7.9\u03bcm.

In our study, hematopoietic stem cells expressing ALDH and bearing early stem cell markers were relatively larger than those previously reported. Future studies will aim to characterize the long term repopulating capability of this fraction of stem cells in in-vivo models."
