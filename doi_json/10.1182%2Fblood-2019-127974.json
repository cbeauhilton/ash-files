    "abstract_text": "Severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCID) are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders characterized by a profound reduction or alteration of T lymphocyte function. They arise from a variety of molecular defects which affect T lymphocytes development and function. The number of infections prior hematopietic stem cells tansplantaton (HSCT), genotype, and the type of donor are described as prognostic factors for stem cell transplants. In this retrospective study, we included 30 pediatric patients suffering from SCID who underwent to CD34+-selected grafts between January 2008 to December 2017 in our center. Diagnosis of reticular dysgenesis, ADA deficiency, or leaky SCIDs and intra thymic deficiency were excluded. A mechanistic mathematical model of all available data was performed and provided a dynamic appreciation of immune reconstitution, while removing bias. T-cell populations were maintained through proliferation and loss model and thymic output have been integrated to the production function. This joint modeling approach aimed to predict rate and extent of T cell immune reconstitution over time (mainly CD3+ T cells, CD3+CD4+ helper T cells, and the CD3+CD4+ CD45RA+ cells). With a median follow-up time of 97.28 months [range 0.85; 131.54], there were 345 points of T cell phenotyping concentrations in total with a median of 12 samples per patient (range, 0 -35 samples) taken post-transplantation. In this data-set, 13 % of the patients (n= 4) died from infections. Time to reach half of the maximal T cell concentrations was estimated to 3.4 months, 95%CI [2.5 - 4.6]. In covariate analysis, genetic diagnosis (p= 0.0047) and conditioning regimen (p= 0.01) were found to be significant pre transplant covariates which impacted the trajectory of T cell concentration with time. This modeling approach appeared to be the best method to learn about the dynamic T cell reconstitution after transplant in patients suffering from SCID. In the context of new cell therapy approach for T cell depletion and in vitro thymic maturation, this mechanistic joint model can be used for the design and analysis of incoming clinical trials.
