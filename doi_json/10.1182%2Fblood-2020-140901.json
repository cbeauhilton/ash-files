    "abstract_text": "The bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) family of proteins bind to chromatin to regulate the transcription of target genes involved in multiple pro-fibrotic pathways and is a novel therapeutic target for reducing fibrosis in myelofibrosis (MF). CPI-0610 is a unique, first-in-class, oral, small-molecule inhibitor of BET (BETi) proteins, designed to promote disease-modifying activity through selective gene regulation of key oncogenic, fibrotic, and inflammatory factors with potential to transform the standard of care in MF. Products with only one mechanism of action are approved currently for treatment of MF, Janus kinase 1/2 inhibitors (JAKi), with ruxolitinib (rux) being the standard of care for treatment-na\u00efve MF patients. A minority of MF patients treated with rux (35%; 106 of 301) or fedratinib (37%; 35 of 96) achieved a spleen volume reduction \u2265 35% (SVR35) at 6-12 months. Disease-modifying therapeutic agents with a novel mechanism of action are needed to improve the outcomes in MF pts. Blocking BET activity with CPI-0610 inhibited aberrant maturation of megakaryocytes and decreased cytokine production in preclinical studies. In addition, synergistic antitumor activity of BETi and JAKi combination was observed in preclinical MF models. Clinical activity of CPI-0610 in combination with rux in JAKi-na\u00efve MF patients observed in the phase 2 MANIFEST study was higher (SVR35 at wk 24: 63%) than that observed with rux alone in historical Phase 3 trials (Mascarenhas, EHA 2020). MANIFEST-2 is a global, phase 3, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, active-control study of CPI-0610 + rux vs. placebo + rux in JAKi treatment-na\u00efve patients with primary MF, post-polycythemia-vera MF, or post-essential-thrombocythemia MF. Key eligibility criteria: DIPSS score \u2265Int-1; platelet \u2265100 x 10 9 /L; spleen volume \u2265 450 cc by CT/MRI; \u22652 symptoms measurable (score \u22653) or a total symptom score (TSS) of \u226510 using the MFSAF v4.0; peripheral blast count  200 \u00d7 10 9 /L vs. 100 - 200 \u00d7 10 9 /L), and spleen volume (\u2265 1800 cm 3 vs. < 1800 cm 3 ). Double-blind treatment (CPI-0610 or matching placebo) will be administered once daily (QD) for 14 consecutive days followed by a 7-day break, which is considered 1 cycle of treatment (1 cycle = 21 days). Rux will be administered twice daily (BID) for all 21 days within each cycle. Primary endpoint: SVR35 response (\u226535% reduction in spleen volume) at wk 24; key secondary endpoint: TSS50 response (\u226550% reduction in TSS) at wk 24; other secondary endpoints: safety, PK, PD, bone marrow morphology/fibrosis, duration of SVR35 response, duration of TSS50 response, PFS, OS, conversion from transfusion dependence to independence, rate of RBC transfusion for the first 24 wks, hemoglobin response, peripheral proinflammatory cytokines.
