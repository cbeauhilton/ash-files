    "abstract_text": "Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a malignancy driven by numerous genetic and epigenetic alterations. Recurrent IgH translocations, somatic mutations and copy number abnormalities all contribute to myelomagenesis, however true drivers of the disease have not been well defined. To identify new targetable dependencies in MM, we generated high-quality active enhancer landscape using large cohort of primary patient myeloma cells (n=70), MM cell lines, and normal plasma cells. We integrated this data with an in-house curated atlas of 600+ active enhancer profile across a wide range of tumor types and normal tissues. Combining these data with gene expression and genetic dependency (CRISPR KO) enabled a multidimensional integration of how transcriptional regulation intersects with tumor specific dependencies. We identified that many of the specific and potent dependencies in MM are transcription factors, especially those establishing plasma cell identity. Among these, the POU2AF1 gene, which encodes the OCA-B/BOB-1, a B cell transcriptional coactivator protein, represented the most striking dependency in MM. Although BOB-1 is expressed throughout B-cell development, we found it to be highly expressed in CD138+ plasma cells from patients with precursor conditions (MGUS and SMM) as well as symptomatic MM compared to normal plasma cells. To functionally validate the role of BOB-1 in MM, we performed loss-of-function studies using shRNA, siRNAs and antisense GapMers specific for BOB-1 and observed a significant impact on MM cell viability and cell cycle arrest. Transcriptomic analysis upon BOB-1 depletion by RNA-sequencing revealed a small set of genes commonly modulated in all 3 MM cell lines tested including the plasma cell differentiation related transcription factor XBP1 and heme oxygenase ( HMOX1 ). Importantly, we observed ribosome biogenesis, RNA polymerase 1A transcription and mRNA translation and elongation processes to be significantly enriched among genes modulated by BOB-1 depletion in MM cells. Bob1 KD resulted in a rapid and robust decrease in the level of transcription of rDNA by RNA polymerase I as determined by qRT-PCR quantification of pre-rRNA (47S). In addition, ChiP assay revealed decreased binding of RNA polymerase 1A to the 18S ribosomal DNA promoter region in BOB-1 depleted cells compared to control. These data indicate that BOB1 downregulation results in the suppression of RNA-polymerase I activity in MM cells. RNA Pol I-dependent transcription governs abundance of rRNA and directly regulates cellular translational and proliferative capacity. Since high protein load is a feature of MM, we evaluated the role of BOB-1 in the translational efficiency of MM cells. We observed that in MM cells compared to control cells, BOB-1 KD decreased, while its overexpression significantly enhanced de novo protein synthesis. As MM is characterized by excess production of monoclonal immunoglobulins, we evaluated impact of BOB-1 perturbation on intracellular light chains (kappa or lambda) production. We observed changes in the intracellular abundance of the light chains with BOB-1 modulation in all MM cell lines tested. As a result of decreased protein production, BOB-1 depletion was associated with induction of resistance to proteasome inhibition suggesting that high expression of BOB-1 may be one the factors driving the exquisite sensitivity of MM cells to proteasome inhibitor. Interestingly, mass spectrometry analysis revealed BOB1 in a protein complex with mTOR, Raptor and mLST8 proteins which are members of mTORC1 complex which is also involved in ribosomal function and may suggest the mechanism of action of Bob-1 at molecular level. In conclusion, here we report BOB1 as a specific proximal dependency in MM cells with potential role in modulating the protein load/capacity balance and ribosomal biogenesis essential for MM cell protein production function and therefore their sensitivity to proteasome inhibition.
