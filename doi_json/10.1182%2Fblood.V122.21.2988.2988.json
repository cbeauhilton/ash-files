Lack of symptom recognition may result in failure to address symptoms and maximize patient functioning. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) can be endpoints in clinical trials to establish treatment benefits. The purpose of this study was to define the content domain for a PRO measure of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) symptom burden. Materials and Methods This is Part 1 of a study to develop a PRO AML/MDS symptom-burden measure. Patients with AML and MDS described symptoms over their disease courses in single qualitative interviews. Content analysis was used to identify symptoms and define the content domain for a PRO measure. After the interview, patients rated the worst severity of 13 common cancer-related symptoms in the last 24 hours on the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) to provide context for analysis. Results Thirty patients participated in an interview (see Table 1 ). Content analysis found a total of 39 symptoms, 14 reported by 20% or more patients, occurring over the disease course. Fatigue and distress (followed by pain) was the symptom reported most often. The mean number of symptoms reported by patients with AML (5.46; sd = 2.83) and by patients with MDS (7.33; sd=4.18) was not significantly different. Proportionately patients with MDS reported more fatigue, disturbed sleep, drowsiness, shortness of breath, headache, and sadness but less pain and numbness/tingling than AML patients. Both groups of patients described symptom interference with day-to-day activities. On the MDASI, fatigue (followed by distress and disturbed sleep) was the symptom reported most often in the last 24 hours. Fatigue had the highest mean severity rating (3.37, sd = 3.36, 0-10 scale) on the MDASI. Table 1 Patient Characteristics  N=30 . Mean . SD * .

Qualitatively, the symptom burden experienced by the two groups of patients is similar. These symptoms can cause significant interference with daily activities. Accurate assessment and management of symptoms is critical to ensure optimal treatment with the best quality of life. The content domain for a PRO symptom-burden measure of AML and MDS encompasses the severity and activity interference of common symptoms of AML and MDS and its treatment.
