The cosmetic disfigurement and severe pruritus dramatically affects the patient's quality of life. The focus is to examine the validity and reliability of the skindex-29, M.D. Anderson symptom inventory (MDASI) and itch-related quality of life (IQOL) questionnaire in 62 patients in a phase II trial of Brentuximab Vedotin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients completed survey questionnaires related to symptoms and quality-of-life several times over the course of Brentuximab Vedotin. We compared patients' baseline scores to their end-of-study (EOS) scores. Patients were grouped by diagnosis into Mycosis Fungoides and Lymphomatoid papulosis group. Questionnaires included skindex-29, focusing on the skin conditions the patient was bothered the most. (MDASI) for patients with cancer and following the symptoms of cancer and the itchy quality of life (I-QoL) questionnaire was developed to measure the symptoms associated with cancer therapeutic agents and their effect on daily activities. Scoring for the Skindex-29, M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) and the Quality of Life (QOL) survey were done according to the questionnaire specific scoring guide. Responses were compared between 2 groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS Questionnaires from 62 patients (23 LyP and 39 MF) were studied at baseline and end of study. Patients were 33 males and 29 females with median age of 60 years (range: 27-86 years). The median overall survival (OS) was significant P = 0.041, when comparing patients with MF to LyP. The median survival time for patients from time of diagnosis with MF was 14.66 years and LyP was not reached. There was no significant difference in progression free survival (PFS) between MF and LyP. The median number of Brentuximab Vedotin cycles was 7 (1-19). Skindex-29 scales, showed change in emotion scale and function scale from baseline to EOS, both groups had a decrease, patients with LyP had a larger decrease in emotion score ( P = 0.069) and function score ( P =0.096) over the course of the study. There was no difference in the symptom scale from baseline to EOS. The patients with LyP had a larger decrease in function score from baseline to EOS. When comparing patients with MF to those with LyP for MDASI, there is no evidence of a difference, from baseline to EOS, in either symptom severity or symptom interference in daily life. In the IQOL when comparing the LyP patients' QOL responses from baseline to EOS, did not show significant difference. Table 1. Change in Skindex-29 scales, by group  Skindex Scale . MF .

While both groups had a decrease, the patients with LyP had a larger decrease in emotion and function score over the course of the study.
