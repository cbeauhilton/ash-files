    "abstract_text": "Background: Anemia in the elderly is associated with significant medical consequences even with mild reductions in hemoglobin (Hb). These include worsening physical disability and heart failure. CKD is a common treatable cause of anemia in the elderly. Given the limited published data on epoetin alfa (EPO) therapy in octogenarians, we evaluated whether responses to QW EPO therapy in patients (pts) with anemia due to CKD were influenced by age. Objective: A subset analysis comparing 2 groups of elderly pts (Group 1: 65\u201379 years (y), Group 2: >/=80y) vs non-elderly (<65y) pts with anemia of CKD not on dialysis was performed on the dataset of a recently completed multicenter, prospective, open-label study examining response to QW EPO therapy. Efficacy was assessed by changes in Hb and transfusion requirements. Methods: All pts had entry Hb </=10g/dL and received EPO at a starting dosage of 10,000U SC QW for 16 weeks (w) titrated to 20,000U SC QW after 4w if Hb increased by <1g/dL. Results: Of 1338 pts evaluable for efficacy, 531 (40%) were 65\u201379y (mean age 72.5\u00b14.2y; 55% women), 186 (14%) were >/=80y (mean age 84.8\u00b13.6y; 58% women) and 621 (46%) /=80y pts with CKD had significant reductions in calculated CrCL, lower SCr, and lower body weight despite comparable mean BL Hb (table). Mean Hb change from BL to final assessment was similar in all three groups (2.4\u00b11.5g/dL for both /=80y). Responses to EPO were seen by weeks 4 and 8 (65\u201379y, 47.8% and 80.2%, >/=80y, 49.5% and 79.0% and /=2g/dL at any point from BL) was 471 (88.7%) in 65\u201379y; 166 (89.3%) in >/=80y and 564 (90.8%) in /=80y, 14.0% vs. /=80y, 11,251\u00b13401U/w, /=80y groups (150.0\u00b150.7U/kg/w, 172\u00b166.3U/kg/w vs <65, 140.0\u00b156.9U/kg/w, p=.0018 and p<.0001 respectively). QW EPO was well tolerated in all three age groups and adverse events were those as previously reported. Conclusions: Though octogenarians with anemia due to pre-dialysis CKD have worse renal function, more comorbidities and presumably less marrow reserve, their response to doses of QW EPO is similar to younger adults. These data suggest that the \u201coldest old\u201d have comparable Hb responses to EPO demonstrating that age is not a limiting factor in the administration of EPO therapy for CKD anemia. This response may in part be due to higher body weight dosing of EPO. Table 1  BL Characteristic (N \u00b1 SD) . <65 years (n=621) . 65\u201379 years (n=531) . >/=80 years (n=186) . p-value .
