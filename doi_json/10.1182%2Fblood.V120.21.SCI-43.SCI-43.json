    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-43 The phase 3 PROWESS clinical trial in 2001 resulted in approval of recombinant human activated protein C (APC) using low-dose, 96 hour infusion therapy to reduce mortality for adult severe sepsis linked to bacterial infection (1). In that trial, APC reduced mortality from 30.8% to 24.7%, an absolute mortality reduction of 6.1% (19.4% relative risk reduction), but this therapy carried a risk of serious bleeding (4.0 vs. 1.5%, p=0.06). Trials of APC therapy for less than severe adult or pediatric sepsis failed to show benefit but confirmed increased risk for serious bleeding. Subsequently, 10 years after the PROWESS trial, the similarly designed large trial (PROWESS SHOCK) (2) failed to document therapeutic efficacy in adult severe sepsis, reporting mortalities of 26.4% vs. 24.2% and, curiously, no increased risk of serious bleeding (1.2 vs. 1.0%, p=0.81). Recombinant APC was thus withdrawn from the market in late 2011. A simple comparison of PROWESS to PROWESS-SHOCK is confounded by significant improvements in ICU standard of care for severe sepsis over a decade. These two trials were notable in being limited to therapy using low-dose APC infusion for four days. The success of PROWESS stimulated major research advances in 2002\u20132012 for understanding APC's in vitro and in vivo mechanisms of action. In preclinical work, APC is highly effective for sepsis, non-infectious inflammatory disease, ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative disorders. This presentation will review current knowledge about mechanisms for APC's antithrombotic and cellular cytoprotection, about new insights that might help explain the absence of efficacy in PROWESS-SHOCK, and about possible avenues towards translating the benefits of APC seen in preclinical studies to patients. This presentation will discuss the rationale for use of second generation APC variants that may reduce the risk of bleeding while retaining beneficial anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective functions. Recent preclinical animal studies indicate that such second-generation APC variants might widen the time-window of opportunity for successful therapies, including for lethal infections. Remarkably, APC reduces mortality caused by high-dose total body radiation in mice by preserving bone marrow cells (3). This presentation will review cellular and molecular mechanisms by which APC affects the response of bone marrow-derived innate immune cells to stress induced by infection or radiation. This presentation will provide evidence for the existence of a previously unrecognized role of coagulation Factor V as a modifier of the response to sepsis therapy with APC. Based on APC's direct cellular effects, one would speculate that the use of second generation APC variants given in high-dose bolus regimens holds great promise for multiple maladies.
