    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4221 Objective To evaluated the efficiency of fludarabine plus cyclosporine for refractory/ relapse aplastic anemia (AA). Methods We treated 7 refractory/ relapse aplastic anemia (AA) patients by fludarabine plus cyclosporine (fludarabine 25 mg/m 2 , day 1-5; cyclosporine 3mg/kg/d) from November 2003 to April 2008. The concentration of cyclosporine was maintained between 200-300ng/ml. The AA patients who was refractory to immunosuppressive therapy was defined as did not get transfusion dependence 6 months after treatment with ATG (anti-thymocyte globulin, ATG) and cyclosporine, who become transfusion dependent again after transfusion dependence were relapse. In the patient group, 5 were males and 2 was female, with ages ranging from 12 to 45 years (median=22.5 years). 3 patients previously were treated by ATG plus cyclosporine, 3 were only received cyclosporine, and one was treated by Allo-HSCT ( Table 1 ). Results The reponse rate was 57.1%(4/7), all were partial remission with count of neutrophil and levels of hemoglobin achieved normal levels while the number of platelet was lower than 100\u00b0A\u030110 9 /L. No serious infection was found. Conclusion Fludarabine plus cyclosporine as a new immunosuppressive therapy for refractory/ relapse aplastic anemia patients is an effective regimen, it was worth to explore in clinical research.
