    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2195 Introduction: Therapeutic vaccination with dendritic cells (DC) is currently considered as an investigational therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for eradication of minimal residual disease (MRD). Dendritic cells derived from autologous peripheral blood monocytes have been tested as cellular adjuvants for therapeutic vaccination of malignancies and proven feasibility and safety, but overall clinical response rates remain very low. The vast majority of DCs used for clinical trials were differentiated with a standard maturation cocktail composed of the cytokines TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and PGE 2 leading to DCs unable to secrete biologically active IL-12. This cytokine is fervently desired because of its leading role in promoting T helper 1 cell polarization and therefore fostering the appropriate adaptive immune responses needed to combat minimal residual disease. Cocktails containing synthetic Toll-like receptors (TLR) agonists emerged as an attractive alternative for the induction of DC maturation with T helper type 1 polarizing capacity. Our present investigation was designed to study the feasability of a clinical grade DC 3-day mDC generation protocol from nonleukemic monocytes of intensively pretreated AML patients with novel maturation cocktails containing different TLR-agonists in vitro and assessment of their potency to induce adaptive and innate immune responses. Material & Methods: Monocytes isolated from peripheral blood of AML patients in CR and healthy donors were differentiated into immature DC with GM-CSF and IL-4. After 48 hours DC were additionally cultured with TNF-a, IL1-b, INF-g, PGE 2 and corresponding to the defined cocktail with the TLR7/8 agonists R848 (R) or CL075 (C) with or without the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) (P) for 24 hours. mDCs were analyzed for expression of maturation surface markers, costimulatory profile, IL-12(p70)/IL-10 ratio, migratory capacity, NK cell activation and polarization of T cells. Results: No significant difference in absolute monocyte counts and percentage of DC recovery between healthy controls and AML patients in CR was found using different maturation cocktails (C, CP, R, and RP). Phenotype analysis of surface marker expression revealed no substantial differences between the different DC generation protocols used in healthy donors and AML patients in CR. The costimulatory profile assesed by the expression of two members of the B7 family, CD80 (B7.1) and CD274 (B7-H1 or PD-L1), was in healthy donors superior to AML patients, but these differences were not statistically significant. Variations were noted in the capacity of DCs derived from different donors to produce IL-12(p70) and IL-10, but importantly no significant differences between AML patients in CR and healthy controls could be observed. Interestingly, both healthy donor and AML derived DCs secrete a significantly higher proportion of IL-12(p70) with R848 containing cocktails compared to CL075. Treatment with the CP cocktails even leads to a inverse Il12/IL-10 ratio in AML patients. The high CCR7 expression was paralleled by a strong migratory capacity as well as positive chemotactic reponses to CCL19 chemokine signals. DCs matured with these novel cocktails induced potent alloresponses and strongly activated NK cells measured by upregulation of CD69 expression and IFN-g secretion. No differences beetween R848 and CL075 could be observed. Conclusion: Here we report for the first time a clinically applicable, time- and resource saving 3-day TLR-agonist containing maturation protocol for the generation of IL-12(p70) secreting DCs from AML patients in remission validated with healthy controls which allowed efficient generation, easy harvesting, stable maturation and substantial recoveries of mature DCs. Comparison of different TLR7/8 agonists showed superiority of R848 in IL-12(p70) production to CL075. We believe that these studies point the way to improved DCs that will induce better and long lasting immune responses in the vaccination against acute myelo Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
