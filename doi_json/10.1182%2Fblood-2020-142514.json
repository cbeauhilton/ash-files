    "abstract_text": "Long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs) are key epigenetic factors that drive the origin and progression of human cancers via mechanisms that are largely unknown. We have previuosly reported the clinical significance of a lncRNA signature in multiple myeloma (MM) as independent risk predictor for clinical outcome; and recently identified a lncRNA RROL (RNA Regulator of Lipogenesis) with impact on MM cell proliferation. Here we describe a unique regulatory function for RROL in the control of gene networks involved in the de novo lipogenesis (DNL) pathway, ultimately impacting MM cell growth and survival. Based on growth and survival impact of RROL depletion, we performed integrated transcriptomic analysis of RNA-seq data after RROL depletion in MM cell lines and CD138+ patient MM cells, and identified a set of significantly modulated metabolic genes including the acetyl Co-A Carboxylase 1 (ACC1) gene, encoding a rate-limiting enzyme of the DNL pathway. This metabolic pathway converts nutrients into fatty acids serving for energy storage or biosynthesis of membranes and signaling molecules. Consistent with the transcriptional control of ACC1, we have observed that RROL inhibition in cell lines and primary MM cells significantly decreased the incorporation of C 14 -radiolabeled glucose into de novo synthesized lipids. Importantly, supplementation with exogenous palmitate, the main downstream product of DNL pathway, rescued the growth inhibitory effect of RROL depletion on MM cells, further confirming the importance of the DNL pathway in the oncogenic activity of RROL in MM. To understand the molecular mechanism through which RROL regulates ACC1 expression and its metabolic axis, we evaluated the RROL interactome in MM cells. RNA-Protein Pull Down (RPPD) and in vivo RNA yeast three-hybrid (Y3H) assays led to the identification of MYC as relevant direct partner of RROL. These results were further validated by qRT-PCR analysis of MYC-bound RNA obtained through RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Using experimental model of conditional MYC KD (P493-6), we found that RROL exerts regulatory activity on ACC1 only in the presence of MYC. Mapping of MYC genomic occupancy by ChIP-seq and gene expression after MYC KD in MM cells revealed that ACC1 is a direct transcriptional target of MYC in cells expressing RROL. These data indicate that RROLand MYC cooperate in the transcriptional control of ACC1. Moreover, we found that RROL itself is transcriptionally regulated by MYC, suggesting the existence of a feed-forward regulatory loop in which MYC enhances the expression of RROL that, in turn, drives MYC transcriptional activity to ACC1. We hypothesized that RROL may shape the protein interacting network of MYC to confer specificity for ACC1 promoter. To this end, we performed mass spectrometry analysis of MYC interactome in three MM cell lines in the presence or in the absence of RROL and identified the transcriptional modulator WDR82 as RROL-dependent MYC partner. Interestingly, WDR82 directly interacts with RROL as assessed in the RPPD and RNA Y3H assays, and transcriptionally regulates ACC1 in RROL-dependent manner. These data indicate that RROL catalyzes the interaction of MYC with the transcriptional modulator WDR82 to form a transcriptional ternary complex regulating ACC1 expression. To therapeutically antagonize the RROL lipogenic signaling we have pre-clinically tested small molecule inhibitors of ACC1 (ACC1i). We have observed significant anti-MM activity of ACC1i in vitro in a large panel of MM cell lines and primary MM cells from patients; and in vivo in mouse models of human MM including the localized subcutaneous model and the disseminated model that establish a more aggressive systemic disease. Importantly, we have now developed clinically applicable ASOs and small molecule-like compounds to directly target RROL in MM cells. These studies are ongoing and will be presented. In conclusion, we here report a unique regulatory function of a novel lncRNA supporting MM cell growth via its control of the lipogenic metabolic axis. The availability of oral inhibitors of ACC1 as well as the ongoing development of RROL inhibitors may allow clinical application of this unique targeted therapy in MM.
