    "abstract_text": "Dysregulation of mRNA translation can contribute to malignant transformation. Translation initiation is a rate limiting step of mRNA translation and protein synthesis and plays a critical role in regulation of cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. We previously reported that ATRA induces translational suppression through multiple posttranscriptional mechanisms during terminal cell differentiation detected by proteomic analysis (Harris et al, Blood, 104 (5) 2004). Here we investigated the regulation of translation initiation and the role of eIF2\u03b1 during terminal differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. We found that ATRA and other granulocytic differentiation inducing agents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), arsenic trioxide (ATO) induce phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 on serine 51 in promyelocytic leukemia (NB4) cells, indicating the suppression of translation initiation. However, monocytic/macrophagic differentiation of NB4 cells by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (phorbol ester, PMA), or by ATRA in U937 and THP-1 myelomonoblastic myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, was not accompanied with induction of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. ATRA, ATO or DMSO-induced granulocytic differentiation closely correlated with induction of expression and phosphorylation/activation of protein kinase C-delta (PKC\u03b4) on threonin 505 and serine 643 in NB4 cells. The specific PKC\u03b4 inhibitor, rottlerin, markedly inhibited ATRA-induced expression and phosphorylation (serin 51) of eIF2a in NB4 cells. Rottlerin reduced phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 expression not only in the leukemia cells but also in solid tumor cells such as breast (MCF7) and pancreatic (Panc28) cancer cells. Because protein kinase R (PKR) has been shown to inhibit mRNA translation by inducing phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, we also examined whether this pathway is involved in ATRA-induced phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and whether it is downstream of PKC\u03b4. We observed that ATRA induces expression and phosphorylation/activation of PKR in NB4 cells. Rottlerin inhibited ATRA-induced expression and activity of PKR , suggesting that activity of PKR is regulated by PKC\u03b4 in response to ATRA in NB4 cells. Overall, our data suggest that retinoic acid suppresses translation initiation through PKC\u03b4/PKR/eIF2\u03b1 pathway during granulocytic but not monocytic differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells. These results revealed a novel role of ATRA in granulocytic cell differentiation of myeloid cells. Because malignant cells usually have hyperactivated mRNA translation, targeting translational factors/regulators of initiation may offer new strategies for the treatment of myeloid leukemia cells.",
