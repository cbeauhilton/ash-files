    "abstract_text": "Introduction: We demonstrated that elevated levels ofcirculating microvesicles (MV) in CLL activate CLL bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) with resultant enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production, a pro-survival factor for CLL B-cells (Ghosh 2009 Blood 113:5568-74). We also detected a phenotypic shift from predominantly platelet/megakaryocyte-derived MV (CD61 + ) in early stages towards a more leukemic B-cell derived MV (CD19 + ) in advanced Rai stages (Ghosh 2010 Blood 115:1755-64). These observations suggest that the MV parameters of their levels and surface phenotypes may predict or be associated with the clinical outcome and/or therapeutic response in a given CLL patient. In this study we therefore designed an approach to being to assess these latter possibilities in regard to MV in CLL. Methods: In vitro stimulation \u2013 Purified CLL B-cells were stimulated in vitro using CpG oligonucleotide (n=10) or anti-IgM antibody (n=10) for 72 hours. MV were isolated from the used media, levels measured and then phenotyped by flow cytometry (BD Canto-I) using standard TRUCount beads (BD Biosciences). In vivo (plasma) work \u2013 MV were isolated from normal plasma (n=5) or plasma of 17 CLL patients entered onto a previously reported Pentostatin, Cyclophosphamide, Ofatumumab (PCO) clinical trial at their entry to the trial and at 6-months after therapy and then sequentially over a period of 18 months (Shanafelt 2013 Cancer 119:3788-96). We determined the phenotypes and plasma levels of MV as described above. Results Phenotypes of in vitro generated MV: We found that, for the most part, CLL B-cells shed MV upon in vitro stimulation however; some CLL B-cells of unmutated IGHV status, but not mutated status, spontaneously generated MV in culture ( Fig. 1 ). Most interestingly, we found that the surface phenotype of MV generated from CLL B-cells carrying predominantly the CD52 surface marker, not the CD19 or CD5 marker. Interestingly, none of the in vitro generated MV was CD20 + , another known marker of CLL B-cells. We found similar phenotypes of the in vitro generated MV by stimulating two different signaling pathways, Toll-like receptor and BCR, in CLL B-cells. Together these results suggest that CLL B-cells generate predominantly CD52 + MV, but not CD19 or CD5, upon in vitro stimulation. MV phenotypes in pre- and post-therapy CLL plasma: Here we focused on the kinetics of MV levels and phenotype in relation to disease outcome for PCO treated CLL. Thus, we found total MV levels were elevated in all patients compared to normal plasma at entry to the PCO trial and then dropped substantially after therapy when compared to the trial entry. Also most CLL patients (n=11) continued to maintain low plasma MV levels until the end of the follow up period (18 months). Interestingly, in a few cases (n=6) total plasma MV levels decreased initially after therapy but then started to rise. These patients are now being followed for disease status in order to determine if rising MV levels are related to a disease relapse. Of interest on flow phenotyping the plasma MV obtained at entry to the PCO trial we detected predominantly CD52 + MV but not CD19 + MV, similar to the findings of the in vitro MV generated from CLL B-cells. Normal plasma (n=5) does not contain significant levels CD52 + MV or CD19 + MV. Together these results suggest that the malignant B-cells shed preferentially CD52 + MV, but not CD19 + MV. We are currently analyzing the MV levels and phenotypes pre- and post-therapy response levels in relation to the patients\u2019 response to therapy in a larger cohort of treated CLL patients (n=60). Conclusion: Current understanding about the phenotypes of MV is based on the concept that MV carry the unique surface marker of the originator cells, e.g., CD19 on B-cell derived MV. However, findings from our in vitro stimulation studies demonstrate that the CD52 but not CD19 is preferentially expressed on CLL B-cell derived MV. We are currently studying the mechanism for such a preferential surface expression on these leukemic derived MV. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing that CLL B-cells generate preferentially CD52 + MV. Our studies are now committed to a more extensive analysis of MV parameters in association with CLL disease progression, depth of clinical response and if the elevation of plasma MV heralds a relapse in responding patients.
