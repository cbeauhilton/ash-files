    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4402 Background High-dose chemotherapy supported by autologous stem cell transplantation is a widely used therapeutic modality especially in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM). However, mobilization failure rates following first attempt are estimated to be between 5% and 30% and remobilization is required in those patients. Although plerixafor, a selective CXCR4 antagonist, is a promising agent for these purpose, mobilization with chemotherapeutic agents would be a hands-on option.\u00b0\u00b0 Therefore we investigated the feasibility of high dose methotrexate and cytarabine with G-CSF as a remobilization regimen in those who failed a prior mobilization and collection with chemotherapy and G-CSF. Patients and methods Mobilization failure was defined as a collection of less than 5 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells after 3\u20135 apheresis procedures. Methotrexate (3,500 mg/m 2 in a 120 min infusion) on day 1 and cytarabine (3,000 mg/m 2 infusion for 120 min) on day 4 and day 5 were followed by G-CSF. Supportive care and leucovorine rescue were done as standard protocol. Peripheral blood (PB) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) were counted with the Sysmex SE9000. PB progenitor cell harvest was initiated when HPC levels reached at least 5 per mm 3 . Results Total 8 patients (6 NHL and 2 MM, median age: 55 years) who have failed in previous mobilization with conventional chemotherapy and G-CSF were tried again with high dose methotrexate, cytarabine and G-CSF. ( table 1 ) Successful collection of CD34+ cells (> 5 \u00d7 10 6 /kg) was achieved in six patients (75%). The total yield of CD34+ cells per kg of body weight harvested by 3 to 5 apheresis procedures was 6.28 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (median; range, 1.53\u2013 10.09 \u00d7 10 6 /kg). ( table 2 ) Conclusion High dose-MTX and cytarabine plus G-CSF may be a feasible chemotherapeutic regimen for stem cell mobilization in NHL and MM patients who have failed in previous mobilization with other type of chemotherapy and G-CSF.
