    "abstract_text": "There is a growing body of evidence that thrombophilia is linked to several obstetrical complications, most likely through uteroplacental vascular insufficiency. Very few studies have however evaluated whether alterations of the uteroplacental blood flow, as assessed functionally by Doppler ultrasound analysis, are associated with thrombophilic abnormalities in women with late pregnancy complications. Forty-nine non-smoking women followed during their whole pregnancy in the High Risk Pregnancy Clinic of the Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, in 2003 were enrolled in this retrospective study. They all had an unexplained late pregnancy complication (intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) (n=34), intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) (n=4), preeclampsia (n=11)). They were not treated with anti-thrombotic agents. They all had a complete thrombophilic work-up (functional antithrombin, protein C and S assays, homocystein level, antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies), activated protein C resistance, G20210A prothrombin gene mutation). Doppler evaluation of the uterine arteries (assessed by the presence of bilateral notches after 26 weeks) and umbilical arteries (assessed by resistance index above 90th percentile) was performed. Thrombophilic abnormalities were identified in 8 of 49 (16%) women (factor V Leiden (FVL) (n=4), G20210A prothrombin gene mutation (n=2) and isolated anticardiolipin antibodies (n=2)). Of the 49 women, 20 had an abnormal Doppler (uterine (n=5) and umbilical (n=15)) including IUGR (n=13), IUFD (n=2) and preeclampsia (n=5). Four women with thrombophilia were found to have Doppler abnormalities (4/20; 20%) while most women with Doppler alterations had no thrombophilia. In conclusion, abnormal uteroplacental Doppler findings are frequently found in women with late pregnancy complications. They do not seem to be correlated with the presence of thrombophilic abnormalities even if thrombophilia seems to be more frequent in obstetrical complications.",
