    "abstract_text": "Background: Clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of the CD30-targeted antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin (BV) for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma(e.g. ALCL, PTCL-NOS, AITL, CTCL and etc.). While clinical trials are critical for establishing efficacy, collection of real-world data outside of the controlled trial setting is important to evaluate how interventions are applied and assess the effectiveness of new treatments in routine clinical practice. Inclusion criteria are often rather restrictive compared with the patient populations seen by physicians in daily practice. There are limited real-world data related to treatment with BV in China. Our study aims to obtain timely real-world knowledge in terms of safety and effectiveness of BV in CD30+ lymphoma patients in China. Study Design and Methods: The study (NCT04837222) is a real-world, prospective, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of BV in patients with CD30+ lymphoma in China. Consecutive CD30+ lymphoma patients treated with BV as a part of standard clinical practice will be enrolled. Key inclusion criteria includes adult patients undergoing treatment with BV or to be received with BV, patient/legal guardian must be able to read, understand, and sign the Informed Consent Form, CD30+ lymphoma by INV (any CD30 expression). Exclusion criteria includes patient who currently participates in or with plan to participate in any interventional clinical trial, any other reason that, in the investigator's opinion, makes the patient unsuitable to participate in this study. As CD30+ lymphoma is not a common disease and the affordability of novel treatment is limited, 1000 patients with CD30+ lymphoma will be recruited from almost 30 hematology centers. The physician will determine the treatment regimen, as well as the frequency of laboratory and clinical assessment according to her/his routine practice. All patients will be followed up per routine clinical practice and data will be documented at baseline/3/6/9/12/18/24 months unless withdrawal of Informed Consent, death or loss of follow-up, whichever comes first. Loss to follow-up will be minimized through active contact with participating patients thereafter to ensure almost all clinically relevant outcomes will be captured. The primary endpoint is serious adverse events. Secondary endpoints include adverse events, adverse drug reaction, dose adjustment, characteristics of patients receiving BV, use of BV, number of BV cycles administered, disease characteristics, time to next treatment, overall response rate, duration of response, progression free survival rate, overall survival rate, quality of life and cost-effectiveness ratio. Descriptive analysis will be performed for data analysis. Disclosures Zhang:  Takeda Pharmaceuticals: Current Employment.",
