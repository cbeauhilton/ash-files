    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The presence of a minimal residual disease (MRD) that remains after treatment is one of the main reasons for recurrence and relapse in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Diagnosis of MRD is becoming vital to assess the effectiveness of the treatment as well as to predict survival among patients with complete remission. CD138 (syndecan-1) is the gold standard marker for detecting MM cells using multiparametric flow cytometry analysis or immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of BM biopsies. However, the presence of highly clonogenic, drug resistant and stem-cell like CD138-negative MM cells have been previously demonstrated. Moreover, hypoxia which is known to drive MM progression, drug resistance and metastasis was shown to significantly decrease CD138 expression in MM cells. In this study, we utilized a novel set of biomarkers to detect MRD in the bone marrow as well as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood, in order to predict progression free survival (PFS) in MM patients defined as complete remission according to the detection of CD138+ cells in their bone marrow. Methods: To detect myeloma cells, we utilized a novel set of biomarkers, independent of CD138 expression and hypoxic state of MM cells (CD38+/CD3-/CD19-/CD14-/CD16-/CD123-) by two-color flow cytometry. We detected MM cells in the bone marrow of 25 patients with complete remission and very good partial response, whose bone marrow was defined as a CD138-negative (less than 0.5%). In order to retrospectively correlate the involvement of MM cells (%) with PFS, we used 24 months as a cut-off and compared the results acquired with the new method to traditional CD138-based flow or histology. In addition, based on the percentage of detected MM cells with the 2% cut-off, we analyzed the time to progression (months). Moreover, we detected MM cells in the peripheral blood from matching MM patients and performed analogous analysis. Furthermore, we also detected CTCs in 7 newly diagnosed patients and compared to 7 patients with progressive disease. Results : A study conducted on 25 patients with their bone marrow defined as a CD138-negative (less than 0.5%) showed that the novel strategy to detect MM cells was more precise than CD138-based flow or histology in predicting PFS. Patients who relapsed in less than 24 months had an average (\u00b1SEM) of 3.53\u00b10.82%, while patients who relapsed later than 24 months had an average of 1.15\u00b10.27% MM cells in the bone marrow when detected by the new method (p=0.004). In addition, the median PFS with <2% or \u22652% of MM cells detected by novel strategy was 31.6\u00b12.8 and 18.5\u00b12.2 months, respectively (p=0.004). Similarly, while CD138 detected very low amounts of CTCs and demonstrated no difference between fast and slow relapsing patients; we found that the new biomarkers detected significant differences in the number of circulating MM cells in patients who relapsed fast and patients who relapsed late or did not relapse. Patients who relapsed in less than 24 months had 1.74\u00b10.42%, while patients who relapsed later than 24 months had 0.4\u00b10.08% CTCs in the peripheral blood (p=0.01). In addition, we detected significantly more CTCs in patients with progressive disease (1.27\u00b10.24%) compared to newly diagnosed MM patients (0.63\u00b10.12%), respectively (p=0.03). Conclusions: The novel flow cytometry-based set of biomarkers provides an alternative strategy to detect MRD in the bone marrow and CTCs in the peripheral blood of MM patients, and both allowed prediction of PFS in MM patients.
