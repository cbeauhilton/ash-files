    "abstract_text": "Darbepoetin alfa (DA) is an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) approved in the USA for treating chemotherapy-induced anemia. However, cancer patients (pts) not receiving chemotherapy can still develop anemia of cancer (AoC), which is often not treated ( Ludwig et al. Eur J Cancer.  2004 ; 40 : 2293 \u20132306 ). As pts with AoC are not receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy and may have few clinic visits, using an ESA with a long dosing interval, such as once monthly (Q4W), may be optimal for these pts. Results from a prior study suggested that Q4W dosing of DA is feasible since 61% of pts (n=21) with AoC receiving 6.75mcg/kg DA Q4W achieved a hematopoietic response (\u22652g/dL hemoglobin [Hb] rise from baseline or Hb \u226512g/dL without a red blood cell transfusion in the prior 28 days) ( Smith et al. Br J Cancer.  2003 ; 88 : 1851 \u20131858 ). Here we report the final results of a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of DA Q4W in pts with AoC. Pt eligibility included \u226518 years, non-myeloid malignancy, AoC (Hb \u226411g/dL), and no chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy within 30 days of screening or during the study. Pts (n=220) were randomized 3:1 to DA (6.75mcg/kg) or placebo (PBO), with stratification based on screening Hb (13g/dL. Serious thromboembolic events (deep vein thrombosis, cerebrovascular accident, and pulmonary embolism) occurred in 2.4% DA pts and in 0% PBO pts. In summary, DA Q4W appeared to be effective and well tolerated in this study for the treatment of AoC. Summary of Hb Results  . DA .
