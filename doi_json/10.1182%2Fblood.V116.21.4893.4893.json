    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4893 The addition of rituximab to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) has been shown to improve the outcome in all age groups with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate the impact on clinical outcomes of adding rituximab to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients in china. A propensity score method was used to compensate for the non-randomized study design. From January 2004 to December 2009, 68 patients were newly diagnosed with DLBCL Using Hans' algorithm based on CD10, BCL-6, and MUM1, the non-germinal center (N-GCB) subgroup 45(66.2%) and germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) 23(33.8%). 32 in the rituximab plus CHOP-based chemotherapy (R+) group, and 36 in the CHOP-based chemotherapy only (R-) group. The complete response rate was significantly higher in the R+ group than in the R- group (81.1 vs. 68.1%, P < 0.005,); The complete response rate of N-GCB and GCB in the R+ group was78.2% and 82.1%, p>0.05 respectively. The complete response rate of N-GCB and GCB in the R- group was58.2% and 71.3 %, p P < 0.001. The rituximab can overcome poor outcomes for N-GCB subgroup of DLBCL. The progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years was 62.4% in the R+ group and 57.0% in the R- group. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was 76.9% for the R+ group and 69.5% for the R- group, P < 0.001. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was 72% in N-GCB Subgroup and 78% in GCB Subgroup for the R+ group, and 48% in N-GCB Subgroup and 68% in GCB Subgroup for the R- group. A multivariate analysis revealed that the addition of rituximab was a strong independent prognostic factor for PFS (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.43\u20130.96, P = 0.031). A subgroup analysis revealed that R+ particularly benefited N-GCB subgroup patients). IPI also showed significant impact for PFS (hazard ratio 1.72, 95% CI 1.34\u20132.14 for one score increase, P < 0.001 as well as OS P < 0.001. In summary, the addition of rituximab to CHOP-based chemotherapy results in better outcomes for DLBCL patients, particularly patients N-GCB subgroup of DLBCL.
