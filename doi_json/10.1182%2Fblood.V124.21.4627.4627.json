    "abstract_text": "The failure of normal hematopoiesis in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) could be induced by a variety of mechanism such as the alteration of property of hematopoietic stem cells and stem cell niche. However, it has not yet been clarified precise mechanism how MDS stem/progenitor cells could replace normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells especially regarding involvement of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). To gain insight into the mechanism of stromal dysfunction, comparative analyses of transcriptomes were conducted between normal and MDS/AML-derived MSCs. Further, we attempted to identify certain effectors originated from MDS/AML cells could alter the function of bone marrow (BM) MSCs. The MSCs derived from healthy volunteer (HV)-derived (normal) and MDS/AML-derived stromal cells were established and analyzed mRNA expression by quantitive PCR (qPCR) array. Additionally, the supporting activity of MSCs for BM CD34+ progenitor/stem cells was examined using serum free coculture system. The interaction between MDS/AML cells and MSCs were evaluated by using Boyden Chamber and the changes of mRNA expression were analyzed. The results of qPCR array revealed that the expression of hematopoietic factors was drastically altered in MDS/AML-derived MSCs as compared with normal MSCs. Among these factors, the expression of SCF and JAG1 mRNA were significantly and consistently reduced in all MDS/AML patients examined. Functional assay of these MSCs demonstrated that the number of colony-forming units (CFU) mixed cells (MIXs) and cobblestone area-forming cells (CAFCs) derived from CD34+ cells was significantly reduced after coculture with MDS/AML-derived MSCs as compared with normal MSCs. Even non-contact culture using Boyden Chamber between leukemic cells and MSCs induced the reduction of SCF and JAG1 mRNA, indicating that certain inducers could be soluble factors. Interestingly, this effect of transcriptomes alteration was negated by nSMase2 inhibitor (GW4869). Exosome transfer assay using Boyden Chamber revealed that GFP and PKH26 in leukemic cells transmit onto MSCs in non-contact coculture system and this transfer of exosome was significantly inhibited by GW4869 or nSMase siRNA. The multiple type of microRNA in exosome derived from MDS/AML cells was transferred into MSCs, suggesting that exosome could contribute to the alteration of mRNA expression in stromal cells. Collectively, these results indicated that exosome derived from MDS/AML cells could be involved in the reduction of SCF/JAG mRNA and the stromal supporting activity of normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.
