    "abstract_text": "Platelet \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 (GPIIb-IIIa), a noncovalently associated heterodimer, is a prototypic integrin that functions as a physiologic receptor for fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 plays a crucial role in platelet aggregation, a key event of hemostatic plug formation and pathologic thrombus formation. During thrombogenesis, the affinity of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 for macromolecular ligands is dynamically regulated. After exposure to subendothelial matrix, several mediators such as ADP and thromboxane A 2 , or shear stress, platelets becomes activated and inside-out signaling that induces a high-affinity state of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 for soluble ligands (\u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 activation) are generated. Previous studies revealed that activation of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 is a reversible process. When platelets are stimulated with weak agonists such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and epinephrine in the absence of fibrinogen, \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 gradually looses its binding capacity. In contrast, thrombin can induce long-lasting \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 activation in the absence of fibrinogen. Although much attention has been directed to the nature of inside-out signaling, the mechanisms by which \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 keep in the high-affinity state still remains elusive. In this study, we have demonstrated a critical role of endogenous ADP via its P2Y 12 receptor in the maintenance of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 activation. Washed platelets adjusted to 50 x 10 6 /ml were stimulated with 0.2 U/ml thrombin or 5 mM U46619 under static conditions. After the 15-min stimulation, 1 mM AR-C69931MX (a P2Y 12 antagonist), 1 mM A3P5P (a P2Y 1 antagonist) or buffer alone was added to the suspensions for additional 5 min. The platelet suspensions were then incubated with FITC-PAC1 and PE-anti-CD62P for 30 min and analyzed in a flow cytometer. AR-C69931MX and A3P5P attenuated the number of activated \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 about 95% and 45%, respectively on the already activated platelets with thrombin- or U46619 without inhibiting CD62P expression. In an another set of experiments, platelets stimulated with thrombin or U46619 for 15min were then diluted to 1:100 with buffer containing the same agonist concentration (0.5 x 10 6 /ml). In these conditions the number of activated \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 was also markedly decreased (~85% reduction). Furthermore, the reduction in activated \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 by the dilution was reversed by the addition of exogenous ADP in a dose-dependent fashion. HPLC analysis revealed that the amounts of ADP released from thrombin- and U46619-stimulated platelets were 2.6 and 0.75 mmol/10 11 platelets, respectively, and these values were comparable with ADP doses required for sustained \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 activation in the diluted platelet suspension. Thus, released endogenous ADP plays a critical role in the maintenance of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 activation, and certain platelet concentrations are needed for this action. We also examined Rap 1b activation during the maintenance of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 activation. Thrombin induced sustained Rap 1b activation in the absence of ligand. However, AR-C69931MX disrupted the sustained Rap 1b activation. Thus, there was a close relationship between the maintenance \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 activation and Rap 1b activation. Our data provide that the continuous interaction between released ADP and P2Y 12 receptor is critical for the maintenance of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 activation.",
