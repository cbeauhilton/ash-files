    "abstract_text": "Objective: The immunoregulatory properties and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could be affected by inflammatory factors. However, there have been few studies about human amniotic MSCs (hAMSCs). We investigated the effects of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 on the proliferation and apoptosis of hAMSCs, and measured the level of inflammatory factors secreted by hAMSCs. Result :hAMSCs were cultured with complete medium with different concentrations of IFN-\u03b3. We detected the proliferation of hAMSCs by Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, analysed apoptosis by flow cytometry (FCM) at 48 h, and mesasured the level of inflammatory factors such as solube HLA-G and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the supernatant at 48 h by ELISA. The level of kynurenine (KYN) was measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. As culture time increased, the proliferation of hAMSCs with different concentrations of IFN-\u03b3 increased rapidly from day 1 to day 4, and then the growth rate slowed. FCM indicated that there was no significant apoptosis in the 100 ng/ml IFN-\u03b3 group compared with cells without IFN-\u03b3. The level of PGE2 and soluble HLA-G in cells with IFN-\u03b3 was higher compared with those without IFN-\u03b3. The level of KYN increased significantly in the cells with IFN-\u03b3. Conclusion: IFN-\u03b3 did not affect the growth and proliferation of hAMSCs, and promoted secretion of PGE2 and soluble HLA-G, and enhanced activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), providing a theoretical basis for hAMSCs to prevent and treat graft-versus-host disease.
