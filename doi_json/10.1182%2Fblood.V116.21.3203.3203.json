    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3203 Platelet activation plays a central role in regulating hemostasis. Uncontrolled activation of circulating platelets can result in the formation of occlusive thrombi and stroke. Following activation, metabolism of arachidonic acid by 12-lipoxygenase (12-hLO) may play a significant role in regulating the degree and stability of platelet reactivity. Using specific inhibitors for 12-hLO which do not interact with other lipoxygenases or enzymes in the COX-1 pathway, we were able for the first time to asses the involvement of 12-hLO in platelet reactivity. In order to assess the role of 12-hLO in platelet activation and thrombosis, dense granule secretion, platelet aggregation, alpha granule secretion, and platelet adhesion and clot formation under flow were measured. Inhibiting 12-hLO results in a complete inhibition of dense granule secretion with only a partial attenuation of alpha granule secretion indicating a novel regulatory scheme for modulating positive autocrine reinforcement of platelet reactivity and clot formation. Addition of the 12-hLO metabolite, 12-HETE (as low as 250 nM), resulted in a significant (25%) increase in PAR1-mediated dense granule secretion compare to agonist alone indicating that 12-HETE may be the crucial metabolite formed by 12-hLO metabolism of arachidonic acid. Importantly, platelet aggregation and adhesion are also significantly attenuated in the absence of 12-hLO. In fact, collagen-mediated platelet aggregation was shifted over 25 fold to the right in the absence of 12-hLO. These studies support the role of 12-hLO in hemostasis and may be a good target for anti-platelet therapy. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
