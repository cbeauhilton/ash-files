    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2780 NK cells play an important role in innate and adaptive immune responses. Most human NK cells express CD16, an Fc receptor for IgG that mediates lysis of antibody-coated target cells and costimulates interferon (IFN)-g production in response to cytokines. IL-18 is an immunostimulatory cytokine with antitumor activity in preclinical animal models. The effects of IL-18 on human NK cell function were examined. Here we show that NK cells stimulated with immobilized IgG in vitro secreted IFN-g; such IFN-g production was partially inhibited by blocking CD16 with monoclonal antibodies. IL-18 augmented IFN-g production by NK cells stimulated with immobilized IgG or CD16 antibodies ( Figure 1 ). NK cell IFN-g production in response to immobilized IgG and/or IL-18 was inhibited by chemical inhibitors of Syk, extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). Stimulation with IL-18 or immobilized IgG could augment IL-12-induced IFN-g production by STAT4-deficient lymphocytes obtained from lymphoma patients after autologous stem cell transplantation ( Figure 2 ). IL-18 also augmented the in vitro lysis of rituximab-coated Raji cells by human NK cells ( Figure 3 ). These observations that IL-18 can co stimulate IFN-g production and cytolytic activity of NK cells activated through Fc receptors makes it an attractive cytokine to combine with monoclonal antibodies for treatment of cancer.
