    "abstract_text": "Introduction : High blood levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a sensitive indicator of cardiac abnormalities, have been associated with poor outcome in patients with amyloidosis. However, its clinical value in lymphoma is unknown. Aim : To assess the value of NT-proBNP as a prognostic variable for survival in patients with lymphoma treated with chemotherapy with curative intent. Patients and methods : Clinical heart examination, evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors, determination of NT-proBNP (ECLIA; Roche) blood levels and high resolution ultrasound echocardiography were done at diagnosis. Clinical variables related with patient characteristics, lymphoma risk and cardiovascular risk were analyzed. Results : 117 consecutive pts have been analyzed: median age: 63 years (range: 18\u201388); male: 56%; NHL: 80%; HL: 20%; ECOG/PS \u22652: 29%; III\u2013IV: 56%; B-symptoms: 16%; LDH >1 nv: 34%; b2-microglobulin >1 nv: 57%; albumin 900, ECOG/PS \u22652, LDH >1 nv, b2-microglobulin >1 nv, albumin < 35 g/L, haemoglobin 60. In multivariate analysis, factors predicting for survival were NT-proBNP >900 (HR 15, 95%CI: 3.9\u201357.8) (p<0.0001) and ECOG/PS \u22652.(HR 4.1, 95%CI: 1.1\u201316.3) (p=0.04). Conclusions: NT-proBNP >900 pg/mL is the strongest prognostic factor for survival in patients with lymphoma following treatment with curative intent. NT-proBNP is an easy, fast, widely available and well-standardized parameter that could be useful in addition to other well-established prognostic indexes."
