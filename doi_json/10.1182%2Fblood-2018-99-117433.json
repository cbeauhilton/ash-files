    "abstract_text": "Background Successful allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in treatment of patients (pts) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is dependent upon graft-versus-leukemia, suggesting that intact immune surveillance is essential for eradicating minimal residual disease. Myeloblast-induced T-cell tolerance through overexpression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is thought to play a significant role in immune evasion through upregulation of tryptophan (Trp) catabolism and kynurenine production, resulting in a Trp-poor environment that leads to immune system suppression. Indoximod is a small-molecule inhibitor of the IDO pathway that acts directly on immune cells to reverse IDO pathway-mediated suppression. We are assessing the safety and preliminary efficacy of indoximod in combination with standard induction chemotherapy in patients (pts) with newly diagnosed AML. Methods In this open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study (NCT02835729), eligible pts with newly diagnosed AML were treated with indoximod in combination with induction chemotherapy (idarubicin 12 mg/m 2 /d x3 days with cytarabine 100 mg/m 2 /d x7 days). Using a \"3+3\" design, indoximod (600 mg [dose level 0], 1000 mg [dose level 1], 1200 mg [dose level 2]) was given orally every 8 hours (Q8h) starting on day 9 of induction. Regimen limiting toxicity (RLT) was defined as any \u2265 grade 3 non-hematologic adverse event (AE) that was not incontrovertibly related to the underlying AML or cytarabine or idarubicin. After induction, pts received up to 4 cycles of high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) consolidation while continuing indoximod. Patients continued on maintenance indoximod for up to 6 months from completion of consolidation therapy. Indoximod was discontinued 4 weeks prior to HSCT in eligible patients and not restarted as maintenance post-HSCT. Results As of July 15, 2018, 31 pts were enrolled (median age 55 years, range 18-78; 77% male). Six patients did not proceed with study therapy due to a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia, issues with medical insurance coverage, consent withdrawal, critical illness, and intestinal myeloid sarcoma preventing oral intake. Pts who received \u22651 dose of indoximod were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (n=25), and pts who received \u226580% of their scheduled indoximod doses were included in the per-protocol (PP) analysis (n=19). Reasons for not completing \u226580% of indoximod doses were: consent withdrawal (n=3), inability to swallow (n=2) and physician decision (n=1). Of the 19 PP patients, 16 (84%) had either unfavorable karyotype or adverse mutation profile and 3 (16%) had secondary AML (s-AML). Indoximod combined with induction chemotherapy was well tolerated; no RLT was observed. The most frequent grade \u22653 non-hematologic treatment-emergent AEs in the ITT population, regardless of attribution, were febrile neutropenia (60%), hypoxia (16%), atrial fibrillation (12%), pneumonia (12%), hypocalcemia (12%), and hypotension (12%). Among 25 ITT pts, 21 (84%) achieved a remission (CR/CRh/CRi/CRp), and 15 of 19 (79%) in the PP analysis achieved remission. Among 12 pts with measurable residual disease (MRD) available in remission, 10 (83%) had MRD <0.02% (MRD-neg). Eleven of 19 pts (58%) received \u22651 cycle of HiDAC and 5 (26%) received maintenance indoximod. All 11 patients who received HiDAC #1 became MRD-neg. Median relapse-free and overall survival have not been reached. IDO Composite Scores in bone marrow were calculated by multiplying percentage of stained mononuclear cells by grade of staining intensity determined by 3 independent pathologists. Median composite IDO1 score in tested pt samples (n=11) was 0.76 (range, 0.1-2.2). Expression of IDO1 mRNA at baseline varied significantly among patient samples analyzed (fold changes (FC) range: 0.1-84, normalized to \u03b2- Actin expression). IDO1 mRNA was significantly upregulated in post-induction samples compared to baseline (FC range: 1.7-248) in 10 out of 12 paired samples. Conclusions Indoximod is well tolerated in combination with standard AML induction therapy. Rates of morphologic response and of MRD-neg status are very promising. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was 1200 mg oral Q8h and a placebo-controlled randomized phase 2 study is under development. Disclosures Emadi: NewLink Genetics: Research Funding.
