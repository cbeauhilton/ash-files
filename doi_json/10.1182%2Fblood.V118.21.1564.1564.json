    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1564 Background: Therapy of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is designed to prolong survival and minimize toxicity; however, an intense debate is ongoing over whether ABVD or BEACOPP should be used upfront and whether a long-term survival benefit is obtained with the BEACOPP regimen. The current study was aimed to personalize therapy based on individual risk factors and interim scintigraphy. Design and Methods: 124 patients with newly diagnosed HL and adverse prognostic factors were prospectively studied between 7/1999 and 8/2005. Patients with early unfavorable and advanced disease were eligible for the study. Study participants were assigned to therapy based on their International Prognostic Score (IPS). Those with an IPS of \u22653 were assigned to 2 cycles of escalated BEACOPP (EB). All others received 2 cycles of standard BEACOPP (SB). Subsequent therapy was prospectively allocated according to the results of early interim GA 67 or PET/CT. Four cycles of EB or SB were administered following a positive or negative scan, respectively. Results: Complete remission (CR) rate, 10-year progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 97%, 87% and 88%, respectively, at a median follow-up of 89 months (5\u2013144). Only 38% of patients, mostly with a bulky mediastinal mass, received radiation therapy. PFS and OS were similar in both groups. Predictive value of negative interim Ga 67 or PET/CT was 87% and 93%, respectively. Fertility status was assessed in 38 females aged <40 years (Table). Twenty four of these patients received 6 cycles of SB, 8 patients had 2 cycles of EB and 4 cycles of SB, 3 patients were treated with 2 cycles of SB and 4 cycles of EB and one patient received 6 cycles of EB. Thirty six females did not have disease progression and 34 of them were found to preserve their cyclic ovarian function (COF). Twenty six females were co-treated with 6 cycles of GNRH agonist triptorelin (Decapeptyl 3.75 mg) for 6 months. 19 patients conceived during the follow-up (30 pregnancies), delivering 23 babies. Deliveries were reported for up to seven years from diagnosis. Notably, the female receiving 6 cycles of EB, co-administered with the GNRH agonist, was among those who conceived and delivered a healthy baby. Conclusion: Six cycles of tailored BEACOPP administered to HL patients with adverse prognostic factors provide encouraging long-term PFS and OS, and fertility is preserved in most females following reduction in the number of chemotherapy cycles and GNRH agonist co-administration.
