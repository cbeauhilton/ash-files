    "abstract_text": "Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) \u22651000 cells/mm 3 on day +23 was an independent predictor of prolonged survival in patients with T/NK-cell lymphoma after autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT). To understand the prognostic value of lymphocyte recovery, we performed a retrospective study analyzing the result of 59 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) patients who underwent APBSCT. All patients were in complete or partial response after APBSCT. A median age at APBSCT was 51. Peripheral blood stem cells were mobilized and collected after cytoxan and G-CSF. The conditioning regimen was melphalan 200. ALC recovery day was defined as a first day of 3 consecutive days when ALC has been recovered more than 1000/mm 3 . A median value was used for the analysis of each noncategorical variable. A median follow-up time after APBSCT was 33.8 months and median recovery days of ALC \u22651000 cells/mm 3 was 23 days. Prognostic factors at the time of APBSCT for transplant OS and PFS included beta-2 microglobulin, serum albumin, recovery days of neutrophil \u2265500/mm 3 , infused mononuclear cell dose, infused CD+34 cell dose and recovery days of ALC \u22651000 cells/mm 3 . Univariate analysis revealed that significant variables at APBSCT for overall survival (OS) were beta-2 microglobulin, day of neutrophil engraftment and recovery days of ALC. Positive predictors at APBSCT for progression-free survival (PFS) were beta-2 microglobulin, day of neutrophil engraftment, serum albumin, infused mononuclear cell count, infused CD +34 cell count and recovery days of ALC. ALC \u22651000 cells/\u03bcL on day +23 was an independent predictive prognostic factors for better PFS ( P = 0.003; Relative risk (RR) = 3.710; 95% Confidence interval (CI), 1.576\u20138.736) and showed tendency for prolonged OS ( P = 0.065; RR=2.411; 95% CI, 0.946\u20136.142) (Table 1).In conclusion, ALC \u22651000 cells/mm 3 recovery on day +23 was a good predictor for better survival in MM after APBSCT.
