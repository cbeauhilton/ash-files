    "abstract_text": "Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) is hematologic disorder caused by autoimmune opsonization and premature destruction of platelets. Approximately 20% of children and the majority of adults will have a chronic course of ITP with antibody-mediated destruction of platelets and the inability to clear immune complexes. Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 are secreted following a Th1 response and are elevated in patients with chronic ITP. Recent treatments for chronic ITP in adults and children have focused on quelling dysregulated T and B lymphocyte activity. We conducted a pilot clinical trial of etanercept, a fusion peptibody composed of the soluble TNF-\u03b1 receptor and the Fc portion of Ig. Hematologic and immunologic responses were measured before, during (blood counts only) and after a 12-week regimen of 0.4mg/kg/dose (max dose 25 mg) of subcutaneous etanercept, given twice weekly. Only fixed-dose prednisone or danazol were allowed as concomitant ITP medications. Cytokine concentrations were measured pre- and post-treatment from plasma and cultured lymphocytes (unstimulated or PHA- [2.5ng/ml] stimulated). Sixteen patients (9 male, 7 female), with chronic ITP (8 post-splenectomy) an initial platelet concentration < 30 \u00d7 10 9 /L were enrolled with data evaluable for 15. The mean age of the patients was 31 years (median 32, min/max 7/52 years). One patient withdrew due to dizziness thought related to the study drug. One patient developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia, was diagnosed with Evans syndrome at treatment week 3 and withdrew from the study. Otherwise, no severe or serious related adverse events were observed. Two patients had a complete platelet response (CR, plt count > 150 \u00d7 10 9 /L at least 6 weeks post treatment), 6 had a partial response (PR, plt count > 30 \u00d7 10 9 /L and double baseline plt count), one had a minimal response (MR, plt count > 30 \u00d7 10 9 /L) and 5 had no platelet response (NR). Two of the patients with PR had a platelet count rise that lasted at least until the end of the 8 week post-treatment observation period. The platelet response rate in nonsplenectomized and splenectomized patients was 67% and 28%, respectively, p = 0.1. Concentrations of IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 IFN-\u03b3 and TGF-\u03b2, before and at the end of the 12-week treatment course, showed marked inter-patient variation and did not predict the platelet count outcome. Both patients that had a CR had a reduction in PHA-stimulated TNF-\u03b1 of 33 and 30%, respectively. Others with NR to treatment had similar declines in TNF-\u03b1, however. Although the precise mechanism of action is unclear, etanercept treatment led to at least a partial platelet response in 50% of patients with persistent ITP and was well-tolerated.",
