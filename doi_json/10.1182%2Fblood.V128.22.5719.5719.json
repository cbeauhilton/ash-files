    "abstract_text": "Introduction Human hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been used to treat a range of hematological and immunological disorders. As a result, the demand for hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in clinical applications is increasing. Amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSC) serve as a potential alternative cell source for therapy. Amniotic fluid can be derived by amniocentesis or therapeutic amniodrainage. AFSC are multi-potent, have low risk of tumorigenicity, can be expanded and do not have legal or ethical limitations. The significant hematopoietic activity of murine AFSC led us to explore the potential of human AFSC (CD117/c-Kit+) towards hematopoietic differentiation and to reconstitution in vivo . Methods Human AFSC (2 nd and 3 rd trimester) and cord blood HSC (CB-HSC; control) were selected for CD117 and CD34 respectively using a MoFlo XDP sorter. Sorted cells (10 4 in 200\u03bcl PBS) were injected intravenously into sub-lethally irradiated NOD-SCID/IL2r\u03b3 null (NSG) mice (n=6/group). Hematopoietic engraftment of human cells (% of human CD45 + within total CD45 + ) and multi-lineage reconstitution (myeloid: CD13, CD14, CD15 and lymphoid: CD3, CD4 and CD8) were assessed at 16 weeks in blood, bone marrow (BM) and spleen by flow cytometry. For subsequent secondary transplants, BM mononuclear cells (MNC) derived from BM harvested from primary recipients of mice were intravenously injected into secondary recipients (1.5x10 7 MNC in 200\u03bcl PBS). Hematopoietic engraftment was assessed at 16 weeks post-transplantation (n=6/group). For further analysis of human donor cell engraftment, Q-PCR was performed on spleen samples harvested from primary and secondary recipients using oligonucleotide primers specific for human ALU repeat sequences; Immunohistochemistry was carried out using anti-human CD45 antibody and detected with a commercially available kit (Dako EnVision Plus, Dako). Results are expressed as mean\u00b1SEM, and statistical analysis was performed using 1-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc tests. Results Human AFSC engrafted the hematopoietic system of NSG mice at levels similar to the ones achieved with CB-HSC (blood: AFSC 7.5\u00b11.3% vs. CB-HSC 6.1\u00b12.2%, p=0.6; BM: AFSC 46.3\u00b17.9% vs. CB-HSC 38.3\u00b18.2%, p=0.6; spleen: AFSC 39.6\u00b19.3% vs. CB-HSC 34.7\u00b110.5%, p=0.7). Similarly, at 16 weeks following secondary transplantation, human donor cell engraftment was comparable between groups in blood (AFSC 11.5 \u00b1 3.9% vs. CB-HSC 16.9 \u00b1 3.9%, p=0.3) and other hematopoietic tissues. Q-PCR and immunohistochemistry confirmed donor cell engraftment in AFSC and CB-HSC groups. Importantly, there were no differences between groups in multi-lineage differentiation at 16 weeks post primary and secondary transplantation. Conclusion Human CD117/c-Kit+ AFSC have functional, multi-lineage hematopoietic potential that is similar to the current \"gold-standard\" stem cell source for hematopoietic transplantation. The ease of isolation during early gestation, as well as their gene-engineering and expansion potential make human AFSC a novel autologous fetal cell source for pre- and post-natal therapy of inherited hematological disorders.
