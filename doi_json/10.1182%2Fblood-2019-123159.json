    "abstract_text": "Senescent cells (SnCs) accumulate with age. Genetic or pharmacological clearance of SnCs delays several age-associated disorders and extends the healthspan of both progeroid and wild-type (WT) mice (Baker DJ et al. Nature, 479: 232, 2011; Baker DJ et al. Nature, 530: 184, 2016). In addition, our previous study showed that transient depletion of SnCs could rejuvenated aged hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and muscle stem cells in normally aged mice (Chang J et al. Nat Med, 22:78, 2016). These findings suggest that SnCs play a causative role in aging and certain aging-related pathologies, and that selective clearance of SnCs with a senolytic agent that can selectively kill SnCs can be beneficial in part by rejuvenating aged tissue stem cells. Thus, senolytic drugs are potential novel anti-aging agents. However, SnCs can re-accumulate within a few weeks after depletion in mice, suggesting that long-term and intermittent clearance of SnCs is required to extend healthspan, as shown in previous studies (Baker DJ et al. Nature, 479: 232, 2011; Baker DJ et al. Nature, 530: 184, 2016). It is not known how long-term and intermittent clearance of SnCs affects tissue stem cells such as HSCs because HSCs are mostly quiescent in order to self-renew and prevent exhaustion. We used p16-3MR transgenic mice to evaluate the effect on HSCs of long-term and intermittent clearance of SnCs by ganciclovir (GCV), which selectively kills SnCs in these mice. We treated WT and p16-3MR mice with GCV (25 mg/kg/day x 5 days/per cycle with a 2-week interval between the cycles by ip injection) or saline (vehicle control) from 12 to 24 months of age. GCV effectively prevented SnC accumulation in p16-3MR mice but had no effect in WT mice. In general, aged p16-3MR mice treated with GCV looked healthier than old vehicle-treated p16-3MR mice and old WT mice treated with vehicle or GCV as expected (Baker DJ et al. Nature, 530: 184, 2016). Importantly, GCV abrogated aging-induced increases in p16 expression, p38MAPK activation, and accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks in HSCs in p16-3MR mice. This abrogation was associated with a significant improvement in HSC clonogenicity, suggesting that long-term and intermittent clearance of SnCs prevents HSC aging in naturally aged mice. This suggestion is confirmed by competitive serial and limited dilution HSC transplantation assays, which revealed that HSCs from GCV-treated old p16-3MR mice were functionally indistinguishable from those of young mice. To elucidate the mechanism by which SnC clearance prevents HSC aging, we evaluated the clonogenicity of Lin \u2212 Sca1 + c-Kit + (LSK) cells from young or vehicle- or GCV-treated old p16-3MR mice in co-cultures with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from these mice. We found that clearance of SnCs not only prevented the decline in HSC clonogenic function with aging but also preserved the hematopoietic supporting function of BMSCs. This preservation was associated with reduced levels of Cdkn2a and Cdkn1a mRNAs and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors (such as Il1\u03b2 , Tnf \u03b1 and Ccl5 ), which can adversely affect HSC self-renewal, and decrease of adipogenic and osteoclastic differentiation. In addition, the levels of the HSC self-renewal promoting factor Spp1 mRNA was higher in BMSCs from GCV-treated old p16-3MR mice than in the cells from vehicle-treated old p16-3MR mice. These findings suggest that long-term and intermittent clearance of SnCs can also inhibit BMSC senescence, which contributes to the prevention of HSC aging.
