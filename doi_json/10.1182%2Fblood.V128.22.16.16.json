    "abstract_text": "While tissue factor (TF)-mediated blood coagulation is essential for maintaining hemostasis, the aberrant activation of TF-mediated coagulation is a major determinant of thrombotic occlusions, the precipitating event in acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and ischemic stroke. Typically, TF on cell surfaces exists in inactive coagulant status (cryptic TF). Cell injury leads conversion of cryptic TF to coagulant active/prothrombotic TF. Molecular differences between cryptic and procoagulant TF and the mechanisms that are responsible for the conversion from one to the other form are poorly understood and often controversial. A majority of the evidence in the literature suggest that level of anionic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine (PS), in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane plays a critical role in regulating TF procoagulant activity at the cell surface. However, other pathways, such as the thioredoxin system or thiol-disulfide exchange pathways involving protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), were also shown to contribute to TF activation by inducing structural changes in TF. It is unknown at present whether TF on cell surfaces of na\u00efve cells exists primarily in the cryptic state because of the limited availability of anionic phospholipids at the outer leaflet or phospholipids present in the outer leaflet play an active role in maintaining TF in the cryptic state. In the outer leaflet of mammalian plasma membrane, sphingomyelin (SM) constitutes up to 50% of the total phospholipids present on the cell surface. It is possible that a high SM content in the outer leaflet may be responsible for maintaining TF in its cryptic state at the cell surface in na\u00efve cells, and the hydrolysis of SM on the outer leaflet mediated by factors released in cell injury contributes to TF activation. The present study was carried out to investigate this possibility. First, we tested the potential effect of SM on TF activity in a reconstituted system in which full-length TF was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles composed of varying molar concentrations of SM with the remainder of the vesicle consisting of phosphatidylcholine (PC). SM, at 35 mol % or higher concentration in the proteoliposome, inhibited TF coagulant activity significantly as measured in factor X activation assay. Ceramide, having a similar sphingosine backbone as of SM, had no inhibitory effect on TF-FVIIa activation of FX. Measurement of FVIIa-TF amidolytic activity showed that SM does not inhibit the amidolytic activity of FVIIa-TF, indicating that SM neither affects FVIIa binding to TF nor TF-FVIIa cleavage of the small substrate peptide. SM also inhibited significantly TF activity of TF reconstituted in PC/PS (94%:6% mol/mol) vesicles. Next, human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were treated with varying concentrations of bacterial sphingomyelinase (b-SMase) to hydrolyze SM in the outer leaflet. b-SMase treatment increased cell surface TF activity in a dose-dependent manner. SMase treatment also enhanced the release of TF-bearing microparticles (MPs). SMase treatment had no significant effect on cell surface prothrombinase activity or annexin V binding to MDMs, indicating that b-SMase treatment did not increase PS availability at the cell surface under our experimental conditions. Similar to that observed in bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages, ATP (200 \u00b5M) stimulation of MDMs increased cell surface TF activity by about 3-fold and triggered the release of TF + MPs. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy revealed that ATP stimulation induced in the translocation of acid(a)-SMase from intracellular compartments to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Treatment of MDMs with sphingomyelinase inhibitors, desipramine and imipramine (1 and 5 \u00b5M), or silencing a-SMase with siRNA markedly reduced the ATP-induced increased TF activity at the cell surface and TF + MPs release. Finally, ATP stimulation was shown to increase the hydrolysis of SM in the outer leaflet of MDMs markedly. a-SMase inhibitors or silencing of a-SMase attenuated the ATP-induced SM hydrolysis. In summary, our data indicate that SM plays a critical role in maintaining TF in the cryptic state in resting cells. Activation/translocation of a-SMase to the outer leaflet following the activation of ATP receptor P2X 7 leads to hydrolysis of SM and thus relieves the inhibitory effect of SM on TF, leading to TF decryption and the release of TF + MPs.
