    "abstract_text": "Vitamin B 12 is an essential micronutrient that plays a fundamental role in cell division and one-carbon metabolism. Vitamin B 12 also plays an important role in hematopoiesis and maintaining the integrity of the nervous system. Vitamin B 12 in serum is bound to two proteins, haptocorrin (HC) and transcobalamin (TC). HC is a glycosylated serum protein of ~68kDa that is produced mainly by myeloid cells and binds the majority of circulating vitamin B 12 (70\u201390%). The exact function of this HC-bound vitamin B 12 is unknown (holo-HC), but it is believed to be biologically unavailable to most cells. The remainder of vitamin B 12 is bound to TC (holo-TC). TC is a 43 kDa non-glycosylated serum protein that is synthesized primarily in the enterocytes and carries vitamin B 12 to the tissues via a specific receptor with a high affinity for holo-TC. Only vitamin B 12 bound to TC is available for cellular uptake and use as coenzymes for L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase that synthesize succinyl-CoA and methionine, respectively. ALPS is a rare autoimmune disease in children resulting from defective lymphocyte apoptosis and is characterized by lymphoproliferation, peripheral accumulation of DNT cells (double-negative T cells; TCR alpha/beta +, CD3+ CD4\u2212 CD8\u2212), often leading to autoimmune multilineage cytopenias. Type Ia ALPS with Fas mutations accounting for ~75% of all reported cases is the most prevalent, High serum vitamin B 12 concentrations have been observed in patients with ALPS studied at NIH Clinical Center. Levels of Vitamin B 12 detected in these patients range from 742 to 35365 pmol/L (median: 2489 pmol/L; mean: 4123 pmol/L; reference interval: 162\u2013708 pmol/L) among 137 patients compiled for this study (Vitamin B 12 : 1pmol/L=1.355 pg/mL). To date, the mechanism of the elevated vitamin B 12 concentrations in ALPS patients has not been determined and we sought to explore the source of elevated vitamin B 12 . Radio- and enzyme immunoassays, size-exclusion chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), western blot, and flow cytometry techniques were used to identify and quantitate the source of the elevated vitamin B 12 concentrations in peripheral blood specimens from ALPS patients and controls. Total and holo-HC levels were 36- and 32-fold higher than the upper limit of the reference interval (Total HC: 250\u2013840 pmol/L; Holo-HC: 240\u2013680 pmol/L), respectively, in ALPS patients. However, total and holo-TC levels (1210 pmol/L; reference interval: 500\u20131500 pmol/L and 143 pmol/L; reference interval: >40 pmol/L, respectively) were not elevated in ALPS patients. The elution profile from size-exclusion chromatography of vitamin B 12 -binding proteins did not reveal any abnormal vitamin B 12 -binding proteins in ALPS. SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis revealed the presence of HC in lymphocyte lysates of ALPS but not apparently healthy controls. Flow cytometry studies also showed elevated levels of HC in all white blood cell types from ALPS patients compared to controls. The results of this study show for the first time that elevated concentrations of vitamin B 12 found in ALPS patients were due to increased leukocyte (including lymphocytes) expression of HC. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism for the increased synthesis and secretion of HC from lymphocytes of ALPS patients, but altered cytokine profiles, including increased interleukin-10 levels in ALPS may contribute.",
