    "abstract_text": "Immune alloresponsiveness following allogeneic HSCT is influenced by the dynamics of immune reconstitution and development of allotolerance. In general, tolerance is induced by thymic clonal deletion (central) and apoptosis or suppression of alloresponsive lymphocytes by regulatory T cells in the periphery. We have recently demonstrated that the size of the TCR repertoire within the CD4 and CD8 compartments can be assessed using VB spectrum by flow cytometry, and expansions/losses of individual TCR VB families can be used as a surrogate marker of TCR variability. ( Exp. Hem.  32 : 1010 \u20131022 ; Br. J. Haematol.  129 : 411 \u2013419 ). Additionally, regulatory T cells can also impact the clonal contractions and expansions within the TCR VB repertoire. Various types of regulatory T cells have been described including CD4+CD25+, CD8+, NK T\u2212cells, and CD3+CD4/CD8\u2212 double negative T cells (DN Tregs). In our current study we investigated the role of DN Tregs on the restoration of immune repertoire diversity. We hypothesized that alloresponsiveness clinically detected as a manifestation of GvHD may be associated with oligoclonal T\u2212cell expansions, and in this context decreased numbers of regulatory T cells suggest deficient tolerizing function by regulatory T cells including DN Tregs. Here we studied a cohort of 60 HSCT recipients (AML, CML, CLL, NHL, AA, and PV), of which 25 patients received matched unrelated donor grafts and 35 received matched sibling donor grafts. Blood was sampled between 2003\u20132006 at monthly intervals after HSCT, and flow cytometry for TCR repertoire in CD4 and CD8 cells as well as the numbers of DN cells were recorded. Additionally, separate samples were collected for measurement of chimerism and were included in analysis when donor lymphoid chimerism was > 60%. A subset analysis was performed based on the presence/absence of GvHD. For the 27/60 (45%) patients with episodes of GvHD, results were obtained at the time of diagnosis of GvHD (grade > 2), while for patients in whom notable GvHD was not captured, the steady\u2212state values at corresponding times were used for analysis. For all patients serial evaluations were available. For the purpose of this study, significant VB expansions/contractions were defined as +/\u2212 2 standard deviation over the average VB family size. Using Cox proportional hazards analysis to identify univariate risk factors for GVHD, CD8 VB TCR contractions > 14 VB families (58.3% contraction of entire CD4 VB repertoire) constituted a strong indicator for increased risk (HR=7.61, p=0.011). This observation is consistent with the fact that oligoclonality of alloreactive T cell clones is frequently accompanied by a significant contraction/loss of remaining VB families and may herald heightened alloresponsiveness as a manifestation of GvHD. Estimation for correlation by Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient also demonstrated that percentage of DN cells strongly correlated with a normalization of CD4 VB TCR repertoire (lower number of expansions; N=57, R= \u22120.51, p=0.027), supporting our hypothesis that DN cells participate in peripheral tolerance and suppress proliferative, alloresponsive CD4 clones. In summary, our results further characterize TCR variability post HSCT and define the role of DN cells in the induction of allotolerance.",
