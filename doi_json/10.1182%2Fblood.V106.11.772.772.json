    "abstract_text": "Background: Idiotype vaccination (Id/KLH) is a promising approach to the treatment of patients (pts) with B-cell malignancies. Our experience suggests that Id/KLH may function best in pts with lower tumor burden who are less heavily pretreated. We have conducted a phase II trial of Id/KLH following cytoreduction with rituximab in patients with treatment naive (TN) or relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular NHL (FL). Treatment: Pts received rituximab, 375mg/m 2 , IV, weekly x 4, wk 1\u20134. Pts with without progression received Id/KLH, 1 mg, SQ, monthly x 6, starting on wk 12, with GM-CSF, 250 mcg, SQ, on days 1\u20134. Pts could receive booster Id/KLH on a reduced schedule until disease progression. Results: One hundred three pts were enrolled and received rituximab; 89 pts received Id/KLH. The last patient was registered in Dec 2003. Among these 89 evaluable pts, 55 were R/R to prior therapy, and 34 were TN. The overall response rate (ORR) following rituximab (assessed at month 3 based on a centralized read of CT scans) was 49% (44/89). Following Id/KLH, the ORR improved to 64% (57/89). The median time for improved response following initiation of Id/KLH treatment was 6.6 months (range 5.8 \u2013 23.4 months) which was consistent with the time required to demonstrate an immune response in those pts tested. Prognostic factors for time to tumor progression (TTP) were evaluated and demonstrated a significant negative relationship for liver involvement (hazard ratio; HR = 9.3, p=0.0017) and 3 or more prior regimens (HR=4.7, p=0.0035). Median TTP has not been reached in the TN group (N=34) and in pts who relapsed after prior chemotherapy (N=26), with an actuarial 18 month progression free survival rate of 69% and 70%, respectively. The group of pts who would be eligible for the ongoing phase 3 randomized registration study (N=71) of rituximab followed by Id/KLH have also not reached median TTP. T-cell responses to both Id and KLH were observed in 80% and 86% of pts respectively (N=15) and were seen after a median of 2 doses of Id/KLH. Likewise, antibody responses to Id and KLH were seen in 13% and 69% respectively (N=23) and developed after a median of 5 to 6 doses of Id/KLH. Conclusion: Id/KLH, administered following rituximab to pts with FL, appears to result in an increase in the response rate and TTP compared to that reported for rituximab alone. We also observed a high rate of cellular immunity against idiotype following Id/KLH. These data support the design of an ongoing PIII clinical study of Id/KLH following rituximab which excluded pts with poor prognostic indicators.",
