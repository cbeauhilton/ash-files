    "abstract_text": "Allograft T cell depletion (TCD) reduces acute graft-vs. host disease (aGVHD) after myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Lower incidences of aGVHD reported after reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation (RIST) may reflect delayed donor T cell engraftment. We compared the incidence of aGVHD following RIST with TCD (19 patients (pts) vs. T cell replete (TCR) allografts (20 pts)(Table). There was no difference in the incidence aGVHD, occurring in 71% of TCD recipients (median onset Day 47) and 70% of TCR recipients (median onset Day 25). After TCD, 100% of those who engrafted prior to any DLI developed aGVHD compared with 56% of those who engrafted after DLI, including two pts who developed \u201clate-acute\u201d aGVHD after Day 100, upon completion of donor T cell engraftment. T cell engraftment after TCD was uneven: engraftment kinetics were associated with residual host circulating CD8 + T cell counts after immune depletion; and aGVHD did not occur in the setting of mixed T cell chimerism (Figure). These observations demonstrate that aGVHD can occur with very low doses (10 5 /kg) of allograft T cells after RIST. Protection from aGVHD conferred by mixed T cell chimerism may be lost with full donor T cell engraftment. With limited donor T cell numbers, host T cells appear to determine kinetics of engraftment and of aGVHD after RIST. Figure: Post-induction circulating CD8 + T cell counts in TCD recipients with delayed donor T cell engraftment. After TCD, all subjects who developed aGVHD did so at or after the establishment of T cell full donor T cell chimerism, and occasionally prior to any DLI. Shaded triangle represents the theoretical area in which values would fall if subjects developed aGVHD prior to complete donor T cell engraftment. Arrows: DLI.
