    "abstract_text": "Signaling pathways play essential roles in biological processes as development, cell proliferation and homeostasis. The accurate modulation of signaling pathways, their adapted interaction and their time- and tissue-specific adjusted regulation are required for normal cell development. PI3K/Akt and Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling pathways act as key regulators in cell proliferation, differentiation and growth. Both signaling pathways include GSK3\u03b2 as a common protein, which may mediate an interaction and cross-talk between the pathways. Aberrant activation of PI3K/Akt signaling has been linked to different types of leukemia while Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling is known to be deregulated in some solid tumors. However, a potential role of Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling for pathogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has not yet been analyzed. In our study we analyzed both signaling pathways in different B- and T-ALL cell lines (RS4;11, SEM, REH, CEM, Jurkat, MOLT-4), thereby focusing mainly on their potential interaction via the protein GSK3\u03b2. Western Blot experiments were performed to evaluate the expression of specific PI3K/Akt and Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin key proteins. To evaluate the activation status of Wnt signaling immunofluorescence and protein fractionation experiments were performed, analyzing the activation linked nucleic localization of \u03b2-Catenin. The effect of pathway activation and inhibition on cell proliferation via chemical compounds was analyzed by WST-1 test. High pAkt levels were detected in B-ALL cell line SEM and T-ALL cell line CEM, indicating a hyperactive PI3K/Akt signaling, whereas other analyzed cell lines diplayed lower pAkt status. Among all cell lines analyzed SEM and CEM also showed the highest cytoplasmic \u03b2-Catenin levels, indicating a direct interaction of both signaling pathways. However, immunofluorescence and fractionation experiments revealed that a translocation of \u03b2-Catenin into the nucleus did not occur. To further investigate the role and interaction of PI3K/Akt and Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling, pathway inhibiting and stimulating experiments were performed. Treatment of cells with Wnt3a led to activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling cascade, characterized by nuclear \u03b2-Catenin accumulation. Inhibition of cell proliferation was detected after treatment with high concentrations Wnt3a (\u2265 500 ng/ml). PI3K inhibition by LY294002 led to decreased phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 at Ser9 and an increased decay of \u03b2-Catenin. Stimulation of PI3K/Akt signaling using activating ligand FLT3L induced GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation at Ser9 and accumulation of cytoplasmic \u03b2-Catenin. However a translocation of \u03b2-Catenin into the nucleus seems not to occur. In summary our results indicate that PI3K/Akt and Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling can interact through their common protein GSK3\u03b2, but stimulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by addition of PI3K/Akt specific activators does not fully activate Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling in ALL cells. Complete activation of the Wnt cascade characterized by translocation of \u03b2-Catenin into the nucleus can only be induced by use of specific Wnt effectors.
