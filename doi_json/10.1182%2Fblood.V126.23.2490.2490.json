    "abstract_text": "Background: Adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia / lymphoma (T-ALL) is an rare and aggressive hematological malignancy with overall survival (OS) according to the UKALL XII/E2993 of 48% at 5 years (Marks et al, Blood 2009). Over the last decade, the incorporation of L-asparaginase, dose intensification (similar to pediatric protocols), availability of newer agents such as clofarabine (Dec 2004) and nelarabine (Oct 2005) have been shown to improve outcomes. We carried out this study to see if the above mentioned changes in treatment have translated to an OS benefit. Methods: After due IRB approval, adults diagnosed with T-ALL from 1990-2014 at Mayo Clinic were identified. All clinical and pathologic data was retrospectively reviewed Comparative analysis was performed based on year of diagnosis before and after 2005 (Group 1, diagnosis prior to 2005, and Group 2, diagnosis post 2005). Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier Method and log-rank test. Chi-square test was used to compare variables. Results: A. Patient Characteristics : Between 1990 and 2014, a total of 92 consecutive patients (pts) with T-ALL were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 33 years (range; 18-88 years) with 72% males. Distribution of pts by year of diagnosis was as follows: Group 1(n= 47) (51%), and Group 2 (n=45) (49%). Median overall survival was 97.2 months. Median follow up for Group 1 was 50 months, during which time 23 (39%) deaths were documented, and 22.8 months (0.9 - 115.4) for Group 2 at which time19 deaths (42%) were documented ( p= 0.04). Pts in Group 2 were older than Group1 (median age 41 vs 27 years (p= 0.004). Apart from age, the two groups were similar in other characteristics (Table 1). B. Therapy received by patient groups : We observed a high use of L-asparaginase containing regimens in Group 1 vs Group 2 [35(74%) pts vs 19 (42%), p=0.0013]. In contrast there was an increase in use of Hyper-CVAD in Group 2; 23(51%) vs. 3 (6%) ( p <0.0001). There was no difference in the use of intensive pediatric protocols ( p= 0.11). There was a trend of increased use of nelarabine in Group 2, however clofarabine usage was not different ( p =0.09, and p=0.6 respectively) (Table1). Allogenic stem cell transplant was offered more in Group 2 compared to Group 1, 16 (36%) patients vs. 10 (21%) patients (p=0.0009). In contrast, 7 (19%) patients underwent autologous transplantation in group 1 vs. none in group 2 (p=0.0009). C. Overall outcome by patient groups : We did not observe any difference in CR, or relapse rates among the two groups. The median OS and time to relapse were also not statistically different among Group 1 and 2 [102.6 vs 61.8 months Figure A, and 7.1 vs 14.1 months respectively]. Furthermore, age adjusted survival analysis was also not statistically significant. Conclusion: In this large cohort of adult T-ALL patients, in spite of significant advances in treatment strategies over the last two decades, we observed no difference in overall and relapse free survival prior to and after 2005.
