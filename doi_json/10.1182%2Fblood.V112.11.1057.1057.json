    "abstract_text": "Background: This is an initial report of a correlative laboratory study of an ECOG clinical trial, E2903, to investigate an array of prognostic factors that are potentially associated with the clinical outcome in previously treated, high risk Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a prognostic model for this group of patients. Method: We have previously reported (ASH, 2007) on initial clinical and toxicity results using a combination of PCR followed by Campath. To date we have clinical response data on 37 patients and have conducted correlative prognostic factor analysis on these patients at entry to the study. The prognostic parameters assessed were fluorescence interphase hybridization (FISH) panel, CD38, ZAP-70 and IGVH (mutated vs. unmutated) status and plasma levels of pro- and anti-angiogenic cytokines. In addition, features such as clinical stage, age, sex and laboratory parameters including total white blood count, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and beta 2 microglobulin (b2m) were studied as predictors of response to PCR. Results: As of July 2008, the response data for the first 41 (the accrual goal is 110) patients who started the induction treatment are available. Of these 41, 3 patients are ineligible and one patient had no response data. The median age was 63 (range 51\u201376) with 29 males and 8 females, median b2m was 4 (range 2\u201328), 11 (31%) were Rai stage 0\u20132, and 26 (69%) were Rai 3\u20134. The median number of prior treatments was 2 (range 1\u20135); 15 of 23 (65%) patients tested for IGVH were unmutated, while on FISH analysis 4 had del 6q, 8 had del 11q, 4 had del 17p and 30 patients had complex FISH defects (>1 defect). Despite the prevalence of high risk features in this cohort of patients, 17 out of 37 responded (best response=partial response), 18 were stable and 2 had progressive disease with an overall response rate of 46%. Prognostic parameters most strongly associated with a clinical response included CD38 negative (p=0.008), ZAP-70 negative status (p=0.01) and mutated status (p=0.03). Responses were independent of age, sex, b2m, ALC, number of prior therapy or FISH defects. Responders showed a prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the PFS of non-responders (i.e., 2-yr PFS 29% vs. 0%, respectively, p<0.0001). Prognostic parameters most strongly associated with PFS included being both ZAP-70 negative (p=0.0009) and CD38 negative (p=0.004). Also, ZAP-70 negative and CD38 negative status was a strong predictor of favorable PFS (p=0.002). Mutated status was borderline significant (p=0.07) in univariate analysis and there was no obvious correlation of baseline angiogenic cytokine plasma levels with PFS. These results also hold in a multivariable Cox model. In the Cox model, mutated status was significantly associated with PFS (HR=0.2, p=0.01). Conclusion: We believe that the PCR regimen is highly effective at inducing responses in previously treated relapsed or refractory CLL patients who carry high risk prognostic markers. Thus, while no CRs were seen all but 2 patients had a PR or were stable after 6 cycles of PCR. The prognostic parameters most strongly associated with predictors of clinical outcome appear to be ZAP-70, CD38 and mutation status. The ability to attain a response also appears to be important for achieving a prolonged PFS. In summary, we believe that the strong clinical activity of PCR in a high risk group of CLL patients provides more evidence for pursuing the regimen as a platform for other combinations. In addition, we have generated a first level prognostic model that will continue to be refined as we proceed to complete this trial.",
