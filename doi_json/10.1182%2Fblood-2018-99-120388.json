    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Hemophilia is a lifelong condition that requires ongoing evaluation of treatment and management strategies to meet the unique needs of each patient. However, these needs, whether they are physical or social, change as a patient moves from childhood, through adolescence and into adulthood and older adulthood. The goal of this study was to use continuing medical education (CME) to improve hematologists' knowledge, competence, and confidence in transitioning young adults to an independent hemophilia treatment plan. METHODS: To address identified practice gaps among healthcare providers caring for patients with hemophilia, an online, case-based activity was developed. Featuring an 18-year old boy with hemophilia preparing for college and living away from home for the first time, the 15-minute CME/CE-certified activity utilized a multimedia approach that combined video vignettes that portrayed physician-patient communication scenarios with detailed commentary and perspective from a recognized faculty expert. The expert commentary was complemented by key supporting evidence in text and slides, as needed. The activity launched on June 30,2018 and was made available to healthcare providers without charge. Educational effectiveness was assessed with a repeated-pairs pre-/post-assessment study design, in which each individual served as his/her own control. Responses to three multiple-choice, knowledge questions and 1 self-efficacy confidence question were analyzed. A chi-squared test assessed changes pre- to post-assessment. P values 0.26 extensive effect). Data were collected through 07/30/2018. RESULTS: Data from the subset of hematologists/oncologists (n=33; hem/oncs) who answered all pre-/post-assessment questions during the study period were analyzed. Significant improvements were observed overall ( P =.0193; V=.166) and in several specific areas of assessment (Table). Following activity participation, 34% of hem/oncs indicated increased confidence with regard to helping teenagers with hemophilia transition to adult care. Lastly, the findings uncovered educational needs that are the focus of ongoing interventions. CONCLUSIONS : Case-based learning has been recognized for its benefits in modeling real-life problems, integration of knowledge into practice, and self-evaluation and reflection. Participation in this online education significantly improved hematologists' knowledge with regard to addressing the needs of patients at different points in their journey.
