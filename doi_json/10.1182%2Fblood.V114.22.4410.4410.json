    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4410 BACKGROUND Autoimmune cytopenia occurs in 5%-10% of patients with CLL. Treatment for patients with both autoimmune cytopenia and progressive CLL is challenging due to poor tolerance of myelosuppression, and the risk of exacerbation of autoimmune cytopenia by purine analogues. METHODS We identified 20 patients from our CLL database of approximately 3000 patients who were treated with a chemoimmunotherapy regimen of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CVP) for both autoimmune cytopenia and progressive CLL from January 2000-December 2008 at Mayo Clinic Rochester. RESULTS Autoimmune cytopenia responded in 19 patients (14 CR and 5 PR) with a median time to progression (TTP) of 13.6 months (range 5 \u2013 29). Five patients remain in sustained remission at last follow up (range 15 \u2013 30 months) and 4 patients have had recurrent autoimmune cytopenia requiring re-treatment. Six patients required maintenance corticosteroid therapy after completing R-CVP. Progressive CLL responded to treatment in 17 patients (9 CR/CCR, 8 PR by NCI-WG 1996 criteria) with a median TTP of 6.3 months (range 1-40 months). Fourteen patients have required additional treatment for progressive CLL at a median of 5.4 months (range 4-22 months). Five patients have not required additional treatment for either CLL or autoimmune cytopenia at 15 -30 months after completing treatment. R-CVP treatment toxicity included 3 patients with grade 3-4 infections, 2 with grade 1 peripheral neuropathy, and one with grade 3 drug-induced pneumonitis. No patient required blood cell transfusions after the completion of cycle 1 of therapy. CONCLUSIONS Although R-CVP is an effective and tolerable therapy for patients with simultaneous autoimmune cytopenia and progressive CLL requiring therapy, the duration of response is suboptimal. Clinical trials testing alternative treatment strategies are needed for this patient population. Disclosures: Zent: Genentech, Bayer, Genzyme, Novartis: Research Funding.
