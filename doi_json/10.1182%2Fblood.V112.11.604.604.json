    "abstract_text": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) accounts for approximately 40% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with an overall 3-year relapse-free survival of 53%. DLBCL consists of a germinal center B-cell (GCB-like) subgroup and an activated B-cell (ABC-like) subgroup exist, associated with good and poor prognosis, respectively. In addition to differential expression of coding genes, ABC-type lymphoma cells express high levels of the non-coding microRNA, miR-155, an onco-miR whose ectopic expression in the mouse has been shown to give rise to B-cell malignancies. DLBCL feature a dysregulated PI3 kinase pathway, which can promote proliferation and survival. PI3K is regulated by phosphatases PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) and SHIP (SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase). PTEN is a known tumor suppressor and is mutated in human cancer with a frequency approaching that of p53 . cDNA array analyses of DLBCL patient specimens indicate that low mRNA expression level of SHIP can be used as a negative prognostic marker for survival. We have now identified SHIP as the first bona-fide target of miR-155. RT-PCR analysis of micro-dissected lymphoma samples confirmed high levels of miR-155 and low levels of SHIP in poor-prognosis ABC-cells as compared to GCB-cells. We further demonstrate that elevated levels of miR-155, and consequent abrogation of SHIP expression, is not due to point mutations or promoter hypermethylation of SHIP in primary DLBCL cells, but rather the result of a TNFa-mediated autocrine loop, a pro-inflammatory cytokine whose serum levels are elevated in DLBCL patients. Consequently, anti-TNFa regimens (Etenercept (Enbrel\u00ae), Infliximab (Remicade\u00ae)) are sufficient to reduce miR-155 levels, restore expression of SHIP, decrease p-Akt levels, and slow tumor cell growth of ABC-sub-type DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, we observe a highly significant decrease in tumor growth when DLBCL-xenograft mice are treated with Etenercept, suggesting a novel approach for restoring tumor suppressor activity and inducing growth inhibition of these aggressive tumors. Our findings offer the first direct evidence that specific miRs can function as a the link between inflammation and cancer. Finally, our hypothesis, that TNFa promotes survival of DLBCL via miR-155, SHIP and pAkt, opens up a novel and immediately accessible (co)treatment for poor prognosis DLBCL.",
