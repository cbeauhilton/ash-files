    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Daratumumab is a human, CD38-targeted, IgG\u03ba monoclonal antibody with both direct on-tumor and immunomodulatory mechanisms of action. In the phase 3 POLLUX study, D-Rd reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 63% and significantly increased the overall response rate (ORR) versus Rd alone (93% vs 76%; P <0.001) in RRMM patients (pts). When combined with standard of care regimens across three phase 3 studies including POLLUX, daratumumab demonstrated \u226550% reductions in the risk of progression or death, doubled complete response (CR) rates, and tripled minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative rates at the 10 -5 sensitivity threshold in pts with RRMM or newly diagnosed MM (Palumbo A, et al. N Engl J Med 2016. 375[8]:754-766; Dimopoulos MA, et al. N Engl J Med 2016. 375[14]:1319-1331; Mateos MV, et al. N Engl J Med 2018. 378[6]:518-528). Improvements in deeper responses gained from novel MM treatments have led to interest in sustained MRD negativity as a potential surrogate endpoint (Kumar S, et al. Lancet Oncol 2016. 17[8]:e328-e346; Anderson KC. Blood Adv 2017. 1[8]:517-521). Here, we present updated efficacy and safety analyses of POLLUX, including sustained MRD negativity, after >3 years of median follow-up. Methods : Pts with \u22651 prior line of therapy were randomized (1:1) to receive Rd (lenalidomide 25 mg PO on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle; dexamethasone 40 mg per week) \u00b1 daratumumab (16 mg/kg IV QW for Cycles 1-2, Q2W for Cycles 3-6, then Q4W until disease progression). High risk cytogenetic abnormalities included t(4;14), t(14;16), and del17p. At the time of suspected CR and at 3 and 6 months after confirmed CR (and every 12 months thereafter if CR was maintained), bone marrow aspirates were assessed for MRD using clonoSEQ \u00ae V2.0 (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA). Sustained MRD negativity was defined as maintenance of MRD negativity at the 10 -5 threshold for \u22656 or \u226512 months. PFS on subsequent line of therapy (PFS2), an exploratory endpoint, was defined as time from randomization to progression after next line of subsequent therapy or death. Results : A total of 569 pts were randomized (D-Rd, n = 286; Rd, n = 283). At a median follow-up of 39.5 months, D-Rd significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus Rd (median, not reached [NR] vs 17.5 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.55; P <0.0001); 36-month PFS rate was 55% versus 28%. D-Rd also prolonged PFS versus Rd among pts with 1 prior line of therapy and pts with 1-3 prior lines of therapy ( Table 1 ). A PFS benefit for D-Rd versus Rd was also observed regardless of cytogenetic risk status ( Table 1 ). D-Rd was associated with a significantly higher ORR versus Rd (93% vs 76%), including higher rates of \u2265very good partial response (80% vs 49%) and \u2265CR (56% vs 23%; all P <0.0001). At the 10 -5 sensitivity threshold, MRD-negativity was achieved by 87 (30%) D-Rd pts versus 15 (5%) Rd pts ( P <0.000001). Among the ITT population, sustained MRD negativity was achieved by 47 (16%) D-Rd pts versus 2 (0.7%) Rd pts for \u22656 months and 37 (13%) D-Rd pts versus 1 (0.4%) Rd pt for \u226512 months (both P <0.0001). Median time to next therapy for D-Rd versus Rd was NR in the D-Rd group versus 22.8 months in the Rd group (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29-0.49; P <0.0001). In the D-Rd group, 98 (34%) overall survival (OS) events were observed versus 118 (42%) OS events in the Rd group; OS follow-up is ongoing. The median duration of treatment was 34.3 months in the D-Rd arm versus 16.0 months in the Rd arm. The most common (\u226510%) grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) observed with D-Rd versus Rd are described in Table 2 . No differences were observed for D-Rd versus Rd in discontinuations due to TEAEs (14% of pts in each treatment group) or incidences of second primary malignancies (7% of pts in each treatment group). Updated data including PFS2 will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion : After >3 years of median follow-up, D-Rd continued to demonstrate a significant PFS benefit and higher rates of deeper responses versus Rd alone in RRMM pts. The higher rate of sustained MRD negativity with D-Rd compared with Rd suggests that continued D-Rd treatment drives these deep responses and delays progression. No new safety signals were observed following a median of 34 months of D-Rd exposure.
