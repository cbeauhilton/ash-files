    "abstract_text": "Background: We recently showed that MDS natural killer cells display altered cytolytic function and proliferation in response to IL-2 ( Leukemia , 2006 ; 20 : 463 \u201370 ). TCR \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are other important components of innate immunity, recently shown to be involved in the immune response against various tumors. Furthermore, a TCR \u03b3\u03b4 agonist synthetic phosphoantigen, the BrHPP molecule, is able to expand and activate in vitro V\u03b42 cells (the peripheral blood circulating subset of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells). We studied \u03b3\u03b4 T cell population in MDS patients. Methods: PBMCs from 31 MDS patients (WHO: 3 pure RA, 2 pure RAS, 1 RCMD-RS, 6 RCMD, 2 del5q, 8 RAEB1, 4 RAEB2, 5 MDS-U; IPSS: 9 low, 12 Int-1, 6 Int-2, 4 High) and 15 controls were stimulated with BrHPP and IL-2 during 8 to 15 days. Immunophenotyping of \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was determined by multi-color flow cytometry. Cytolytic capacity of activated V\u03b42 T cells was assessed using 51 Cr release and CD107a degranulation assays. IFN\u03b3 was measured by ELISA after TCR \u03b3\u03b4 triggering of expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Results: % and absolute numbers of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells from MDS were comparable to those of controls, but MDS V\u03b42 T cell repertoire was significantly skewed: 10/19 MDS V\u03b42 T cells were characterized by a \u201cnaive\u201d predominant population, 5/19 had a majority of \u201ceffectors\u201d cells, and only 4 of 19 had a predominant \u201ccentral memory population\u201d, which was always the main V\u03b42 compartment in healthy donors. Stimulation with BrHPP induced a significant increase of MDS V\u03b42 T cells subset, indicating their specific activation. However, MDS V\u03b42 T cells poorly proliferated in 2 week cultures in response to IL-2, in contrast with the high proliferation index of controls derived cells. On day 8 of culture, only 6 of the 29 MDS samples studied clearly responded to BrHPP+IL-2 (i.e. >60% of V\u03b42 cells in culture) compared to 13/15 in controls, while 12/29 were intermediate responders (20 to 60% of V\u03b42), and 11/29 non-responders. We found no correlation between response to BrHPP and WHO, cytogenetics or IPSS category. However, coexistence of immunologic abnormalities (rheumatoid arthritis in 5 patients, temporal arteritis in 1, antiphospholipid syndrome in 1, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon in 2, and thyroiditis in 2) was more frequent in non-responders. The 3 IL-2 receptor (IL-2-R) chains were normally expressed in MDS V\u03b42 T cells and IL-2-R\u03b1 expression was normally induced in response to IL-2. We are currently investigating downstream signaling molecules of the IL-2-R pathway. Functional activity of MDS \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (cytotoxicity, degranulation, and IFNg secretion) was similar to that of healthy donor cells. In particular, those cells were cytotoxic against the MDS-derived P39 cell line. Conclusion: in MDS, \u03b3\u03b4 T cell repertoire is profoundly skewed, and those cells do not proliferate in response to potent agonists, although their numbers and function seem normal. Those alterations did not correlate with MDS characteristics, but were more frequent in patients with associated immunological abnormalities. Our results further support the existence of important alterations of innate immunity effectors in MDS that could play a role in disease pathophysiology or progression.",
