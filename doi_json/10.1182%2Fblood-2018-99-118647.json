    "abstract_text": "Introduction The liver-produced hormone hepcidin regulates the body iron stores. Its expression is induced by iron and inflammatory cytokines but repressed by the erythroid regulator erythroferrone (ERFE) when erythropoietic activity intensifies during anemia. Although Erfe -deficient mice fail to appropriately suppress hepcidin during the first 24h following hemorrhage, these mice still recover from anemia with a few days delay suggesting that another mechanism compensates for the absence of ERFE. We therefore decided to study the kinetic of hepcidin during the recovery from anemia induced by bleeding in Erfe -deficient mice. Material and methods Six week-old C57BL/6 WT and Erfe -deficient mice were phlebotomized (500 \u03bcL) and analyzed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 days after phlebotomy until full recovery. Results Liver hepcidin mRNA expression was suppressed 5-fold one to five days after phlebotomy in WT mice. In contrast with the sustained inhibition of hepcidin, serum ERFE concentration progressively decreased after 24 hours to reach its baseline at day 4. Interestingly, although hepcidin levels were unchanged after 24 hours, Erfe -deficient exhibited significantly reduced hepcidin levels after 48 hours. Hepcidin mRNA and protein levels were comparable to those of WT mice 2 to 5 days after phlebotomy. Interestingly, the repression of hepcidin occurred without any change in phosphorylation of the effectors Smadd1/5/8 and in hepatic expression of the BMP/SMAD target genes Atoh8 , Smad7 and Id1 . Similarly, mRNA expression of the proposed negative regulators of hepcidin Gdf15 , Twsg1 and Gdf11 was not increased in the spleen and the bone marrow of phlebotomized mice compared to control mice. Finally, disruption of the erythroid compartment by irradiation or injection of carboplatin prevented the suppression of hepcidin in WT and Erfe -deficient mice. Conclusion An alternative mechanism regulates hepcidin independently of iron and ERFE during stress erythropoiesis. Our data suggest that a second yet unknown erythroid regulator of hepcidin may exist. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
