    "abstract_text": "We have reported that of the 10 commonly used AAV serotype vectors, AAV6 is the most efficient in transducing primary human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, the transduction efficiency of the wild-type (WT) AAV6 vector varies greatly in HSPCs from different donors. Here we report two distinct strategies to further increase the transduction efficiency in HSPCs from donors that are transduced poorly with the WT AAV6 vectors. The first strategy involved modification of the viral capsid proteins where specific surface-exposed tyrosine (Y) and threonine (T) residues were mutagenized to generate a triple-mutant (Y705+Y731F+T492V) AAV6 vector. The second strategy involved the use of ex vivo transduction at high cell density, which revealed a novel mechanism, which we have termed, 'cross-transduction'. The combined use of these strategies resulted in transduction efficiency exceeding ~90% in HSPCs. Our studies have significant implications in the optimal use of capsid-optimized AAV6 vectors in genome editing in HSPCs. Disclosures Leboulch: bluebird bio: Patents & Royalties.
