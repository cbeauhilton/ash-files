    "abstract_text": "Background: Mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in mice and man can be induced using G-CSF (G) or by the use of chemokines and chemokine receptor antagonists. Recent preclinical and clinical data using the bicyclam AMD3100 (A) suggests that the combination of G+A results in significantly improved yields of HSCs compared to G alone in both mice and man ( Blood.  2005 ; 106 : 1867 ). In humans, optimal mobilization of HSCs occurs 6\u20139 h after subcutaneous (s.c.) A. These mobilization kinetics necessitate the somewhat undesirable administration of A the evening before the first day of apheresis. Methods: We assessed the kinetics of HSC mobilization in mice and man after IV or s.c. administration of A. Human donors were initially mobilized with increasing doses of IV A (80, 160, 240 or 320 \u03bcg/kg). After 4 days of drug clearance, the same donors were then mobilized with a single s.c. dose of A (240 \u03bcg/kg) and collected cells were used as a source of HSCs for HLA-matched sibling recipients undergoing single dose (550 cGy) TBI and cytoxan allogeneic HSC transplantation ( Devine et. al. Blood . 2006 ; 108 : 53 ). Results: Peak mobilization of mouse CFU-GM occurred 3 h after s.c A (5 mg/kg; 15\u201318-fold; n=5) and 0.5\u20131 h after IV A (1\u20133 \u03bcg/kg; 10\u201312-fold; n=3). Identical CFU-GM kinetics were observed after mice were first given G (250 \u03bcg/kg) for 4 days then administered either s.c. A (250\u2013500 fold in 3 h; n=3) or IV A (170\u2013350 fold n=3). To date, 6 normal HLA-matched sib donors have been treated with 80 \u03bcg/kg (n=3) or 160 \u03bcg/kg (n=3) IV A over 30 minutes followed 4 days later by 240 \u03bcg/kg s.c. A. Peak mobilization of CD34+ cells occurred 1\u20134 h after 80 \u03bcg/kg IV A, 4\u20136 h after 160 \u03bcg/kg IV A, and 9 h after s.c. A. The more rapid kinetics of CD34 mobilization after IV A is in contrast to the kinetics of s.c. A in autologous transplant patients receiving both G and A ( J Clin. Oncol.  2004 ; 22 : 1095 ) and in normal volunteers receiving A alone (\u223c9 hours; Blood . 2003 ; 102 : 2728 ). This data suggests that IV A not only mobilizes HSCs from mouse and man more quickly than s.c. A, but also, that the peak of mobilization may be enhanced (6.4-fold at 160 u\u03bcg/kg IV vs. 5.2-fold for 240 \u03bcg/kg s.c.) and prolonged (5.7 fold at 160 \u03bcg/kg IV vs. 3.8 fold for 240 \u03bcg/kg s.c. at 6 h post-A) after IV A. IV A also induced: (i.) a more rapid and greater peak of CD19+ B cell mobilization (6-fold at 1 h and 6.7-fold at 4 h) than s.c. A (2.2-fold at 6 h), (ii.) a modest increase in CD4+ and CD8+ CD3+ T cell mobilization (3.2-fold vs. 1.1-fold for sc A at 6h) and (iii.) no significant changes in Treg, NK, CMV-specific CD8, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. To identify genes that are differentially expressed following G or A mobilization, we performed RNA profiling analyses using Affymatrix U133+2 arrays and RNA isolated from purified (>95%) CD34+ HSCs obtained from 5 individual normal donors mobilized sequentially with A and G. Of note, CXCR4, CCR9, ALCAM, ICAM, and CEECAM1 were expressed more abundantly in all A mobilized CD34+ cells while mucin, Integrin \u03b1 6, Integrin \u03b1 2b, and CEACAM1 were more abundantly expressed in all G-mobilized CD34+ cells. Conclusions: IV A results in more rapid and prolonged mobilization of mouse HSC and human CD34+ cells compared to s.c. A. IV A was not associated with any adverse events in the 6 donors mobilized at the first two IV dose levels. The enhanced and more rapid mobilization of CD34+ cells by IV A may have significant applications for the optimal collection of peripheral blood HSC products.",
