    "abstract_text": "The treatment of hemophilia A (HA) is primarily based on replacement of factor VIII (FVIII), and in people with HA with inhibitors (HAwI) on the use of by-passing agents. Recently, a FVIII mimetic bispecific antibody emicizumab (Hemlibra\u00ae) was approved for treatment of HA and HAwI, offering a subcutaneous, prophylactic treatment opportunity with potential for significantly reducing the treatment burden. We describe the development and pre-clinical characterization of Mim8, a novel, next-generation FVIII mimetic human bispecific antibody. Mim8 is a highly potent molecule bridging factor IXa (FIXa) and factor X (FX) in development for subcutaneous treatment of people with HA and HAwI. Development of Mim8 utilized the Duobody \u00ae platform to initially screen for compatible anti-FIXa and anti-FX antibodies followed by several iterations of systematic mutational optimization. In total, more than 30,000 bispecific antibodies were analyzed. The optimization process aimed for efficient Mim8-mediated activation of FX by FIXa in the presence of procoagulant membrane, low target binding in solution, low immunogenicity risk, and for desirable biophysical parameters such as low viscosity. In vitro characterization demonstrated that Mim8 efficiently localizes FIXa and FX to the phospholipid surface and enhances FXa activation. The monovalent anti-FIXa arm alone stimulates the proteolytic activity of FIXa in the range of 15,000-fold and is an important contributor to the activity of the bispecific antibody. The dissociation constants ( K d ) of Mim8 for FIXa and FX is in the micromolar range, minimizing target binding in the blood. Using thrombin generation assay in congenital HA plasma and thrombelastography (TEG) in whole blood from healthy volunteers spiked with anti-FVIII antibodies, Mim8 was capable of normalizing thrombin generation and blood clot formation, respectively, with approximately 15 times greater potency than emicizumab (Figure 1). A similar potency improvement was demonstrated in a tail vein transection bleeding model in FVIII-deficient mice co-dosed with human FIX and FX to circumvent lack of Mim8 cross reactivity to murine FIX and FX. The terminal half-life of Mim8 was estimated to 14 days (range 10-17 days) in cynomolgus monkeys and the subcutaneous bioavailability to 97%. In conclusion, Mim8 is a novel, next-generation FVIII mimetic bispecific antibody with anti-FIXa and anti-FX arms that potently stimulates FX activation resulting in efficacious haemostasis in vitro and in vivo . Mim8 has a high potency allowing for administration of small volumes in a pen device, good PK parameters, minimal target binding in the blood, and good biophysical properties. Collectively, these properties support clinical development of Mim8 as a potentially improved next-generation FVIII-mimetic prophylactic treatment option for persons with hemophilia A regardless of inhibitor status.

Right: thromboelastography in whole blood from healthy donors spiked with polyclonal anti-FVIII antibody (mean and SD of n = 3). Coagulation was triggered with low concentration (\u223c30 fM) of tissue factor (Innovin\u00ae 1:200,000). Shaded areas: standard deviation of controls. Blue circles: Mim8. Grey squares: a sequence identical analogue (SIA) to emicizumab (comparable data were obtained with a commercially available batch of Hemlibra\u00ae).
