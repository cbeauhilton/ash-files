    "abstract_text": "Introduction: IPI-504 is a novel, water-soluble Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor. It is the chemical reduction product of 17-AAG, a well-characterized Hsp90 inhibitor. 17-AAG is currently in clinical trials, but suffers from very poor aqueous solubility and must be administered to patients in either suboptimal DMSO formulations, or newer cremophor or emulsion formulations. In contrast, IPI-504 exists as a hydrochloride salt which is soluble in water in excess of 200 mg/mL. Therefore, IPI-504 is 4000-fold more soluble than 17-AAG. It has previously been shown that IPI-504 inter-converts with 17-AAG and exists in a pH and enzyme-mediated dynamic redox equilibrium which has been observed in human clinical trials as well. In preclinical animal studies, IPI-504 has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor effects in a variety of cancers including xenograft and orthotopic models of multiple myeloma (MM). Methods: An open-label phase I dose-escalation trial of IPI-504 infused on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21 day cycle is being conducted in patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory MM. IPI-504 is administered to pts in 250cc of normal saline over thirty minutes. The primary objectives of the study are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) marker effects of IPI-504. Levels of Hsp70 protein were measured as a marker of IPI-504\u2019s biologic activity in peripheral blood leukocytes. Toxicity is evaluated by NCI CTCAE (v3.0) and response by EBMT. An accelerated dose titration design was employed with dose escalation of 100% for the first three dose levels with 1 pt / cohort. The first three pts received 22.5, 45 and 90 mg/m 2 respectively. Per protocol, once the 150 mg/m 2 level was achieved, dose escalation converted to a modified Fibonacci schema with 3 pts per cohort. Subsequently dose escalation occurred in increments of 66%, 50%, 33% and 25%. Results: Currently, 15 pts (11 female / 4 male), average age 61.3 years, have been treated. IPI-504 has been well-tolerated at doses ranging from 90 to 300 mg/m 2 . Patients continue to be enrolled at the 400 mg/m 2 dose level. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), defined as grade 4 or greater hematologic toxicity and/or grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity within the first 21 days of treatment, have not been observed to date. Dose escalation will continue until a recommended phase 2 dose is identified. Analysis of PK, safety, tolerability, and biologic response to IPI-504 is ongoing. The above support the planning of further clinical exploration of IPI-504 including combination with agents such as bortezomib that have proven synergistic in animal models of MM.",
