    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4010 Despite intensive research multiple myeloma (MM) is still an incurable disease. MM cells are strongly dependent on the BM micro-environment where growth factors are secreted. IGF-1 is one of the most important growth factors in MM and thus forms an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy. Previously, we demonstrated that picropodophylin (PPP), an IGF-1R kinase inhibitor, indeed has potent anti-MM effects both on human cells and in the 5T2MM and 5T33MM murine models. However, mice eventually relapsed and showed signs of morbidity. Therefore it would be an attractive approach to combine PPP with other cytotoxic drugs. ABT-737 is a BH3 mimetic that binds with high affinity to Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w, but not Mcl-1. In MM, elevated expression of the Bcl-2 pro-survival family of proteins, especially Mcl-1 and to a lesser extent Bcl-2, has extensively been shown to cause resistance to drug induced apoptosis in MM cells. Consequently, ABT-737 was shown to have potent anti-MM activity but only on a subset of human cell lines. Only very recently, it was shown that the ABT-737 sensitivity appears to be determined both by the Bcl-2/Mcl-1 expression ratio and the interaction of these anti-apoptotic proteins with Bim. Interestingly, we demonstrated that IGF-1R inhibition reduces the expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL and that IGF-1 down-regulates the expression of Bim. In addition, a protective effect of IL-6 and BMSC against ABT-737 has been reported. Together, all the above suggests that it would be beneficial to combine ABT-737 with agents that target growth factors, like PPP. Here, we investigated the potential synergistic anti-MM effects of PPP and ABT-737 and studied the underlying mechanisms using two human myeloma cell lines (OPM-2 and RPMI-8226) and the murine 5T33MM model. Both PPP and ABT-737 (kindly provided by Abbott Laboratories) alone were found to significantly decrease cell viability and induce apoptosis dose and time dependently as evidenced by a decrease in ATP levels and an increase in the number of AnnexV/7'AAD positive cells. However, in agreement with previous reported data, we observed differential sensitivity to ABT-737 between the cell lines used. Nevertheless, treatment with PPP/ABT-737 synergistically decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis in all cell lines. In addition, by western blot analysis we could observe increased cleavage of caspase- 3,- 9 and PARP. Mechanistically, PPP was found to circumvent the adverse effect of ABT-737 by blocking the ABT-737 induced Mcl-1 expression and increasing the expression of Noxa. Interestingly, while CD138+ 5T33MM cells were more sensitive to PPP and the CD138- cells more sensitive to ABT-737, treatment with PPP/ABT-737 targeted both MM cell subpopulations to an equal extent. Finally, we tested the combination of PPP and ABT-737 in the 5T33MM model in a prophylactic setting. Whereas, vehicle and ABT-737 treated mice exhibited progressive MM growth, PPP, and to a significant greater extent, PPP/ABT-737 reduced the tumor burden and prolonged overall survival (p\u22640.001). In conclusion, PPP combined with ABT-737 appears to have synergistic anti-MM activity and might thus be a novel and promising therapy strategy for MM.
