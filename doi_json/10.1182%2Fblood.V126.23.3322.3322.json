    "abstract_text": "Background: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) is amongst the most curable malignancies with survival close to 80% [1]. Combination of all- trans- retinoic-acid (ATRA) and anthracyclines is the current standard of care for high-risk APML patients [2]. Literature on combination of arsenic trioxide (ATO) with ATRA in high risk APML, the number of cycles and long-term toxicity of ATO is scarce [3]. Methods: It is a single center retrospective study. Diagnosis of APML was made by bone marrow (BM) and PML-RAR\u03b1 detection by RT PCR. Patients with high risk APML (defined as TLC>10000/\u00b5L) enrolled after 2006 were included and treated with combination of ATO/ATRA as per the protocol (Fig. 1). RT PCR for PML-RAR\u03b1 was done after remission induction, completion of consolidation and 6 monthly thereafter. Results: A total of 39 high risk APML patients were treated during the study period (25 males, 14 females) with median age 31y (range 15-50). Cohort was poorly educated (median - 10 th standard) and were from poor socioeconomic strata (mean monthly income - INR 7000, 1USD=65INR). The major presenting complaints were bleeding manifestation and fever (78%, 84% respectively) for a median duration of 30 days (range 3-90d, 95% CI - 14.8). Baseline clinical, hematological and coagulation parameters are as enumerated in Table1. Table 1. Descriptive statistics high risk APML patients at baseline . Minimum . Maximum . Mean . Std.

Thrombosis was present in 17.1% of the patients. Differentiation syndrome (DS) was seen in 59% (n-23) of the patients at mean duration of 5.6 days of starting therapy (range: -4 to 14d). Twenty one percent of patients with DS (n-5) succumbed to death and all these patients had features of spontaneous DS prior to starting ATO/ATRA. Deaths due to differentiation were primarily seen in during the first week of starting therapy (median-D4). In rest all cases DS improved with dexamethasone 10mg BD and interruption of ATO/ATRA. Outcomes: Median duration to hematological remission was 31days (range: 2-59d). Bone marrow remission was attained in all patients alive at the end of induction. Molecular remission was attained in 100% of these patients. OS was 84.1% (Fig 2A). Log survival curve (Fig 2B) elucidates the fact that those patients who survived the induction therapy had no mortality further during the course of illness. Event free survival (EFS) was 84.1%, same as OS suggesting no patients relapsed during the therapy. Mean follow up of the cohort was 910 days (range 1 - 2681d, SD - 854.3d). Long term follow up these patients showed no evidence of secondary malignancy as feared by most authors for giving ATO therapy. Conclusions: Four cycles of ATRA/ATO with two years of maintenance therapy produces long-term remission with low risk of relapse and no arsenic induced long term toxicities in patients with high risk APML.
