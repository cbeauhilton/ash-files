    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Pain is the top concern of individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). Acute painful vaso-occlusive episodes in SCD are the leading cause of emergency department (ED) encounters and frequent hospital admissions. Well-documented disparities include significant delay and under treatment of SCD patients with acute pain crisis in the ED. An acute care observation unit (ACOU) staffed with SCD specialists can help to address these disparities. SCD patients treated in a dedicated ACOU have a 40% lower admission rate than patients treated in the ED. An expedited transfer and treatment program at our dedicated sickle ACOU at the University of Illinois Hospital (UIH) was implemented with the goal of improving overall care and decreasing the hospital admission rate for SCD patients. Method: This is an outcome study of individuals with SCD >16 years of age who presented with an acute painful episode to UIH. A quality improvement project used the Plan-Do-Study-Act translation method. The following key areas were identified for intervention: 1) established criteria for direct ACOU admission, 2) expedited transfer to the ACOU from the ED, 3) addition of a third provider to expand hours, and 4) establishing a consistent but individualized pain treatment plan across the ED and ACOU. The number of admissions to hospital of patients with SCD was examined from September 2018 through August 2019. Applying the Donabedian triad of Structure, Process, and Outcomes, we demonstrated improved outcome and decrease hospitalization. Results: There were 877 admissions to the ACOU from January to July of 2019, which is an increase of 37% compared to the same period in 2018. Of the 877 admissions, 793 were discharged home (90.4%) as compared to 88.6 % in 2018. The average time to first dose of opioids in the ACOU in 2019 was 55 minutes with and average decrease in the pain score of 2.62 during an average length of stay of 4:18 hours. Conclusions: Expedited care and treatment with a focus on improving quality and improving access resulted in increased volume of patients treated and decreased rate of admission to the hospital. Allocating resources to a dedicated sickle acute care observation unit can significantly decrease inpatient hospitalizations. Table. View large Download slide Table.
