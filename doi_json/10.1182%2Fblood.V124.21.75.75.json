    "abstract_text": "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a distinct form of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, which is etiologically associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection during early infancy. Although HTLV-1 can effectively immortalize human T cells, there is a long latency period of ~50 years before the onset of ATL, suggesting that HTLV-1 infection alone may be insufficient for the development of ATL, but additional acquired genetic events that accumulate during the later life are essential for the development of ATL. However, such somatic alterations underlying the pathogenesis of ATL have not been fully elucidated. To obtain a complete registry of genetic alterations in ATL, we performed an integrated genetic study, in which whole-genome/exome and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed together with array-based methylation and genomic copy number analysis among a cohort of 50 paired ATL samples, followed by extensive validation using targeted deep sequencing of detected mutations in > 400 follow-up samples. Compared with other lymphoid malignancies, ATL cells carried higher numbers of mutations, copy number alterations, and rearrangements than in other lymphoid malignancies, suggesting the presence of global genomic instability in ATL. In addition to previously reported mutational targets in ATL ( TP53, TCF8 , and FAS) and known targets frequently mutated in other lymphoid malignancies ( CARD11 , GATA3 , IRF4 , POT1 , and RHOA ), we identified a variety of highly recurrent mutations affecting previously unknown mutational targets, many of which are involved in T-cell development, activation and migration, immunosurveillance, and transcriptional regulation. Molecular and functional analysis using human T-cell leukemia cell lines showed that some of these novel mutations actually augment T-cell receptor signaling, validating their biological significance in ATL. A comparison of mutations among disease subtypes revealed that several subtype-specific mutations, including TP53 , CD58 , IRF4 and TBL1XR1 mutations in acute and lymphoma types, and STAT3 mutation in chronic and smoldering types, suggesting that different oncogenic mechanisms underlie different ATL subtypes. Furthermore, ATL cells had a distinct pattern of copy number changes and genomic rearrangements. Interestingly, their gene targets showed a significant overlap to mutational targets. Surprisingly, somatic focal deletions involving the 14q31.1 locus were observed in all the cases examined by whole-genome sequencing and therefore are thought to uniquely characterize ATL genomes, although their gene targets remained to be identified. Like other regions also frequently deleted in ATL, such as 7q31.1 and 1p21.3 loci, these deletions were thought to reflect high levels of genetic instability. Finally and conspicuously, pathway analysis revealed that multiple genes involved in the Tax interactome were systematically altered in ATL, although Tax itself underwent gene silencing in most cases. These data suggested that ATL cells can escape from cytotoxic T-lymphocytes by silencing immunogenic Tax expression, while developing alternative oncogenic mechanisms through acquiring somatic mutations or copy number alterations in the Tax-related pathway. Our findings suggest that deregulated T-cell functionalities caused by genetic alterations, especially those associated with HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein, are central to ATL pathogenesis, and provide a novel clue to contrive new diagnostics and therapeutics for this intractable disease.
