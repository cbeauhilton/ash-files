    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5287 INTRODUCTION: Ferroportin (FPN) is the sole mammalian iron exporter protein known and it plays a critical role in iron metabolism. It is expressed in various types of cells including duodenal enterocytes, hepatocytes, erythroblasts cells, syncytiotrophoblasts and reticuloendothelial macrophages. Ferroportin is expressed in multiple alternative transcripts: with (FPN1A) or without (FPN1B) an iron-responsive element (IRE). The expression of one form rather than the other depends on cell type and iron availability. The expression of ferroportin in thalassemia intermedia (TI), characterized by iron overload, is not yet fully elucidated. AIM: To investigate the different expression profile of ferroportin isoforms during erythroid differentiation in control and TI cell cultures. METHODS: After informed consent, the CD34 + cells were obtained from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and from patients with thalassemia intermedia by positive selection using anti-CD34-tagged magnetic beads and cultured for 14 days with a medium containing stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin 3 (IL-3) and erythropoietin to induce erythroid differentiation. The expression profiling of FPN1A and FPN1B was evaluated at baseline, day 7 and day 14 of culture by real-time PCR (2\u0302-dCt). RESULTS: In control cultures, FPN1A isoform was highly expressed at erythroid progenitors stage (day 0 of culture), decreased at early erythroblasts stage (day 7) and increased again at late erythroblasts stage (day 14). In TI cultures, the FPN1A isoform expression remained high even in early erythroblasts ( Table 1 ). In control cultures the FPN1B isoform expression was very low at any stage of erythroid differentiation, whereas in TI cultures it was highly expressed at baseline and, althoug decreased during differentiation, remained always higher than control ( Table 2 ).

In control cultures, FPN1A was mainly expressed in undifferentiated erythroid progenitors and in mature erythroblasts, suggesting a functional role at these stages of erythroid differentiation. In TI cultures, the persistent expression of FPN1A at early erythroblasts stage was probably due to thalassemic erythropoiesis. These data suggest that in TI condition other signals, such as the erythropoiesis status, can override iron overload in regulating ferroportin expression.
