Functional impairment of AML1 caused by point mutation is also reported in patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, molecular basis for leukemogenesis caused by functional impairment of AML1 is still elusive. In this study, we clarified the deregulated signaling pathway induced by loss of AML1. Results: To find the direct target of AML1, we compared gene expression profile between AML1-conditionally deleted and normal KSL cells using Cre-ER system. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using molecular signature database (MSigDB) clarified enhanced expression of NF-kB target genes in AML1 deficient cells. In addition, NF-kB inhibitor attenuated the enhanced colony forming activity of bone marrow cells from AML1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice. These data indicate the aberrant activation of NF-kB signaling pathway in stem/progenitor cells of AML1 deficient mice. NF-kB is a transcription factor which is involved in many physiological phenomena including proliferation, survival, and inflammation. Because deregulated activation of NF-kB signaling has been reported to be responsible for many types of tumors including hematological malignancies, we assumed that lack of AML1-mediated suppression of NF-kB signaling lead to malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells. p65, one of the major components of NF-kB stays in cytoplasm with IkB in a steady state. Once receiving stimulating signals from cell surface receptors such as TNF-a receptor, IkB is phosphorylated by IKK complex and subsequently degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, resulting in nuclear translocation of p65 and transactivation of NF-kB target genes. First, we found that AML1 inhibits nuclear translocation of p65 and that nuclear localization of p65 is enhanced in AML1 deficient cells, which is cancelled by NF-kB inhibitors. In addition, AML1 inhibited p65 phosphorylation at serine 536, which is important for its activation. We found that AML1 physically interacts with IKK complex and thus suppresses its kinase activity, which accounts for a mechanistic basis for inhibition of NF-kB signaling by AML1. Suppression of IKK kinase activity by AML1 results in inhibition of both nuclear translocation of p65 and activation of NF-kB target genes. Next, we examined how leukemia-related AML1 mutants affect NF-kB signaling. Remarkably, AML1 D171N mutant found in MDS neither inhibited nuclear translocation of p65 nor attenuated the kinase activity of IKK complex. Similar results were obtained with AML1/ETO generated in leukemia with t(8;21). Mouse bone marrow cells immortalized by AML1/ETO showed enhanced nuclear localization of p65 compared with those immortalized by MLL/ENL, another leukemia-related fusion protein. Indeed, AML1/ETO immortalized cells are more sensitive to NF-kB inhibitor-mediated growth suppression, indicating a critical role of NF-kB signaling in transformation by AML1/ETO. To verify the activation of NF-kB signaling by AML1/ETO in human hematopoietic cells, we analyzed the gene expression data reported by Valk et al. in silico. We found that NF-kB signaling is distinctly activated in AML1-related leukemia patients. These results suggest that aberrant activation of NF-kB signaling induced by functional impairment of AML1 may contribute to the development of leukemia via proliferation signals. Conclusions: We found that AML1 is a cytoplasmic attenuator of NF-kB signaling pathway. Functional impairment of AML1 caused by genetic disruption results in distinct activation of NF-kB signaling by altering IKK kinetic activity. This aberrant activation may play a central role in pathogenesis of AML1-related leukemia and MDS. Therefore, NF-kB signaling is one of the attractive candidates for molecular targeted therapy against AML1-related hematological disorders.
