    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5040 Introduction Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal disease originating from myeloid progenitor cells with a heterogeneous genetic background. High-dose cytarabine is used as the standard consolidation chemotherapy. Oncogenic RAS mutations are frequently observed in AML, and patients with RAS mutations benefit most from high-dose cytarabine as postremission therapy (Neubauer et al., J Clin Oncol 2008). The molecular reason for this phenomenon is not well understood. Methods We used bone marrow cells expressing a conditional MLL-ENL-ER oncogene to investigate the interaction of oncogenic RAS and chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, we used primary human inversion 16 positive AML samples with or without oncogenic RAS mutations to corroborate our findings. Results There was no difference in cell cycle kinetics, apoptosis or cellular senescence in MLL-ENL cell expressing control vector vs. MLL-ENL cells expressing oncogenic RAS in response to cytarabine treatment. However, we observed an increased activation of DNA damage checkpoints in MLL-ENL-cells expressing oncogenic RAS after incubation with chemotherapeutic agents. This resulted in an Atm/r as well as p53-dependent genetic program causing dramatically reduction of clonogenicity in MLL-ENL cells expressing oncogenic RAS due to induction of myeloid differentiation. Co-expression of dominant \u2013 negative p53 completely abolished this differentiation resulting in the rescue of the clonogic potential. Activation of p53 as a result of inhibition of Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53 further enhances this myeloid differentiation. Of note, in primary AML cases, oncogenic RAS also was associated with a more differentiated phenotype. Conclusions The data can explain the beneficial effects observed in AML patients with oncogenic RAS mutations treated with high dosages of cytarabine and suggest that induction of p53-dependent differentiation, e.g. by interfering with Mdm2-mediated degradation, may be a rational approach to increase cure rate in response to chemotherapy since stronger acitvation of p53 by oncogenic RAS and chemotherapeutic agents cause the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells to more differentiated progenitors. The data also support the notion that the therapeutic success of cytotoxic drugs may depend on their ability to promote the differentiation of tumor-initiating cells.
