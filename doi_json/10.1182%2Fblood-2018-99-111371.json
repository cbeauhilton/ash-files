    "abstract_text": "Background and Objectives: Sickle cell disease is a severe inherited form of anemia caused by a genetic mutation. Polymerization of hemoglobin leads to a cascade of effects decreasing blood flow. This causes tissue hypoxia leading to acute and chronic damage to the organs and endothelial lining. This disease requires complex management that relies on comprehensive training and knowledge regarding the disease process. Often accurate knowledge of sickle cell disease and how to provide appropriate care in the general medical population is limited. The purpose of this project was to develop a sickle cell educational training module for medical professionals. Such a module could be used to guide the provision of accurate education regarding sickle cell disease and best practice when caring for this patient population. Methods: Goals and learning objectives were created and current medical literature about caring for sickle cell disease was reviewed. A comprehensive PowerPoint presentation was produced along with a provider tip sheet and a pre and posttest. The presentation, tip sheet, and tests were reviewed by a board certified pediatric hematologist/oncologist along with the hospital's educational review committee in the Department of Professional Regulation. Once approved, the PowerPoint, tip sheet, and tests were combined into a learning module and uploaded onto an online learning system utilized by the hospital system. The module was sent to over 2,400 outpatient providers and staff and to all inpatient staff on units where sickle cell patients stay when admitted. The module consisted of the participant completing a 10 question pretest, then reviewing the PowerPoint presentation and tip sheet. Following the review of the PowerPoint and tip sheet, the participant completed a 10 question posttest and completed an evaluation of the module. Analysis: There were 223 people who completed the Sickle Cell Disease Learning Module. A paired t-test was conducted to compare pre-test scores to post-test scores. There was a significant difference in the pre-test scores (M = 5.98, SD = 1.66) and post-test scores (M = 9.17, SD = 1.36); p = <0.0001. Conclusion: The goal of this module was to increase baseline medical knowledge of sickle cell disease. The results indicate there was statistically significant improvement in baseline knowledge, based on pre and post data (p = <0.0001). While the results indicate statistically significant increases in performance, it would be important to see if improvements are sustained over time. Reassessment of participants one year after completion of module can be beneficial to see if learned knowledge has been retained. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
