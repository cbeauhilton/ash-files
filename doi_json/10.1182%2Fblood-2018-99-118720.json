    "abstract_text": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major barrier for the success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We have identified the central role of the histone methyltransferase Ezh2 in regulating allogeneic T-cell expansion, differentiation and function. Conditional loss of Ezh2 in donor T cells inhibits GVHD in mice due to the inability of alloreactive T cells to persist. However, the molecular mechanism by which Ezh2 deficiency causes alloreactive T cell death remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that genetic deletion of Stromal Interaction Molecule (Stim) 1, a dynamic endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ sensor and regulator of Ca 2+ signaling, rescues antigen-activated Ezh2-null (Ezh2 -/- ) T cells, leading to restored persistence of alloreactive effector T cells in mice and severe GVHD. Using RNA-sequencing analysis, we found Ezh2-deficiency led to the upregulation of multiple genes (e.g., Ifng, Prf1, Ccl5, Ccl4, Upp1 and Spp1) known to be regulated by Ca 2+ signals through calcineurin (CN), the primary target of the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A (CsA). This reverse correlation between Ezh2 inhibition and CsA-treatment for gene expression suggests that Ezh2 may antagonize Ca 2+ signaling in activated T cells. Calcium signaling assays revealed higher cytosolic Ca 2+ uptake and more frequent Ca 2+ oscillations in Ezh2 -/- T cells. Moreover, Ezh2 -/- T cells exhibited significantly increased polarization of Stim1 and Orai1 in the cellular membrane. These data reveal an unexpected role of Ezh2 as a negative regulator of Ca 2+ entry, thereby serving as a 'brake' for Ca 2+ signaling. Using the C57BL/6 (B6) into Balb/c mouse GVHD model, we found significantly fewer Ezh2 -/- or Stim1 -/- IFN-g-secreting effector T cells compared to the WT counterparts on day 8 or 14 post-transplantation. In contrast, deleting Stim1 from Ezh2 -/- donor T cells rescued the cells in the spleen and liver, producing even more donor T cells and IFN-g-secreting effector T cells compared to WT T cells and inducing severe GVHD. We further examined the cell autonomous effect of Stim1 deletion on the rescue of Ezh2 -/- T cells by mixing WT T cells (B6/SJL, CD45.1) with Ezh2- and/or Stim1- conditional knockout T cells (i.e., Ezh2 -/- , Stim1 -/- or Ezh2 -/- x Stim1 -/- B6 T cells (CD45.2)) at a ratio of 1:1 before transferring into the Balb/c mice. While loss of either Ezh2 or Stim1 led to lower frequency of IFN-g + IL-2 + effector T cells, combined deletion of both genes restored the frequency and number of IFN-g + IL-2 + effector T cells to that of WT T cells. Thus, Stim1-mediated Ca 2+ signals are crucial for mediating cell death in alloantigen-driven Ezh2 -/- effector T cells. To further determine whether the inhibition of CN-NFAT contributes to the rescue, we treated T cell receptor (TCR)-activated Ezh2 -/- T cells with CsA or the calcium release-activated channel specific inhibitor BTP2, respectively, in vitro . While BTP2 dramatically improved the survival of IFN-g-producing effector T cells, CsA did not, suggesting the involvement of CN-NFAT-independent pathways. Ca 2+ overload is known to impair mitochondrial function and cause massive cell death. As compared to TCR-activated WT T cells, activated Ezh2 -/- T cells displayed significantly less ATP, lower mitochondrial membrane potential, enlarged mitochondrial mass, and decreased capacity to upregulate oxidative phosphorylation. Stim1 deletion largely reversed the metabolic defect in Ezh2 -/- T cells, indicating the critical role of mitochondrial metabolism in rescuing these T cells. Considered together, our findings identify the remarkable coordination between Ezh2- and Stim1-regulated effector T cell persistence. As such, these investigations may lead to new approaches to inhibit GVHD, with broad implications to defining fundamental mechanisms of T cell differentiation for control of adaptive immunity, such as tumor immunity and autoimmunity.
