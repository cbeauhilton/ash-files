    "abstract_text": "Objective : This meta-analysis evaluated the impact of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) added to chemotherapy on treatment outcomes including survival and disease recurrence in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods : Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE,Google Scholar databases were searched until December 7, 2015 using the following search terms. Randomized control trials (RCTs), two-arm, and prospective studies that investigated patients with AML who underwent stem-cell transplantation were included. Results : The overall analysis revealed significant improvement in overall survival (OS) (pooled HR= 0.90; 95%CI, 0.83 to 0.98; P = 0.017) and disease free survival (DFS) (pooled HR = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.94; P = 0.002) for patients receiving G-CSF with chemotherapy. Among patients without prior AML treatment, there was significant improvement in DFS (pooled HR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.98; P = 0.021) and reduction in incidence of relapse (pooled HR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.96; P = 0.015) for those who received G-CSF. However, subgroup analyses found no significant difference between G-CSF (+) and G-CSF (-) treatments in rates of OS (P = 0.135) and complete remission (CR) (P = 0.357) for patients without prior AML treatment. Among patients with relapsed/refractory AML, there was no significant difference found between G-CSF(+) and G-CSF(-)groups for OS (P = 0.225), DFS (P = 0.209) and CR (P = 0.208).[EG1] Discussion and Co nclusion : Treatment with chemotherapy plus G-CSF appears to provide better survival and treatment responses compared with chemotherapy alone, particularly for patients with previously untreated AML.
