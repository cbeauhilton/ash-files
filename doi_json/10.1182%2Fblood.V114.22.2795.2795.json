    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2795 Poster Board II-771 Background: The interaction of Multiple Myeloma (MM) with its bone marrow (BM) microenvironment is important for the homing, survival, and proliferation of the malignant plasma cells. In this study, we aimed at answering the question which cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors are typically found in the BM of untreated MM patients as well as in MM patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) and might be involved in the pathogenesis of MM and/or Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD). Design and Methods: Applying Multiplex Bead-based Luminex technology and Quantikine ELISAs, we determined the concentrations of 34 cytokines/chemokines in the supernatants of 10 myeloma cell lines as well as in the plasma derived from BM and peripheral blood (PB) samples of 10 newly diagnosed MM patients, 20 MM patients post alloSCT, and 20 healthy donors. Results: Besides factors known to be secreted by myeloma cell lines (IL-1RA, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP1\u03b2, MIP-3\u03b1) we observed secretion of other cytokines/chemokines such as EGF, HGF, IL2R, IL-12p40/p70, IL-22, IP-10, MIG, and RANTES. In the BM plasma samples of MM patients, we detected elevated levels of HGF, IL-2R, IL-16, EGF, IL-1RA, IP-10, MCP-1, and MIG (p<0.01 or p<0.05). Most of these factors were significantly increased in the BM compared to PB. In addition to increased levels of the factors mentioned above, the BM plasma of MM patients post alloSCT showed selectively elevated concentrations of IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p40/p70, and eotaxin (p<0.01 or p<0.05). Eotaxin levels were particularly high in patients with chronic GvHD. Correlating the BM cytokine/chemokine levels with the clinical characteristics of MM patients, we observed that BM levels of IL-16 (r=0.829, p=0.003) and HGF (r=0.805, p=0.005) correlated positively with myeloma cell infiltration within the BM. In addition, IP-10 (r=0.770, p=0.009), HGF (r=0.645, p=0.044), and IL-6 (r=0.664, p=0.036) correlated significantly with the initial stage of disease. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that myeloma cells themselves generate a significantly higher number of cytokines/chemokines than previously described. We show that characteristic cytokine/chemokine patterns exact in the BM environment of MM patients before and after alloSCT. Certain factors, such as MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, HGF, IL-16, IP-10, and eotaxin might not only be developed into diagnostic instruments and/or predictive biomarkers, but might also represent potential targets for future myeloma- or GvHD-specific therapies.
