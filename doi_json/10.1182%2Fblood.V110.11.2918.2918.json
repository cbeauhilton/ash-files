    "abstract_text": "Objectives: Acquired resistance to imatinib (IM) in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is frequently due to mutations of the BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD). Current thinking holds that this results from the selection of pre-existing mutant clones on IM. As new BCR-ABL inhibitors with differential activity against KD mutant BCR-ABL have become available, precise quantification of key mutations even at a low level is required to adequately monitor responses. Here we report that the occurrence of G250E, Q252H, Y253F/H, E255K/V, T315I, F317L, F359V mutations at the time of IM resistance is independently associated with a high maximum IM dose. Patients and Methods: We have developed highly specific allele-specific ligation-PCR assays (L-PCR) to accurately quantify a panel of frequent KD mutations, including G250E, Q252H, Y253F/H, E255K/V, T315I, F317L, F359V. In limiting dilution experiments the L-PCR assays routinely detect between 0.05 and 0.1% of mutant allele in total BCR-ABL, and their average dynamic range is in the range of 4.5 log. Forty-three patients with imatinib failure were analyzed. The median age was 60 (range 20 \u2013 75) years and the median disease duration 64 (range 3\u2013213) months. Eleven patients were in blast crisis, 20 in accelerated phase and 12 in chronic phase. Results: Patients were treated with chemotherapy (48%) and/or interferon alpha (76%) prior to IM. The median maximal IM dose was 600 (range 500\u2013800) mg and the median duration of total therapy until resistance was 15.5 (range 1 to 75) months. Eighteen patients (42%) had dose reductions due to toxicity. At the time of IM resistance, clonal evolution was present in 21/41 (47%) of the patients. L-PCR identified 50 mutations in 29/43 patients (67%) (table1). One, 2, 3 or 4 different mutations were identified in 14, 11, 2 and 2 patients, respectively. The T315I and E255K/V mutations accounted for 32/50 (64%) of all mutations, while Q252H and Y253H were not detected. Twelve mutations (24%) were confirmed by direct sequencing (DS) and an additional M315T mutation and a K247R polymorphism were detected. Thirty eight (76%) mutations were negative by DS for the corresponding mutation from the L-PCR panel but additional mutations (L248V, M351T, H396Rx2, L298Vx2) were identified. All 38 L-PCR positive mutations were confirmed in a second independent experiment. The mutated clone was significantly smaller in mutations with no confirmation by DS (median 0.2, range 0.05\u201312.63%) compared to positive by DS (median 40.76, range 13.58\u2013100%, p=0.003, Wilcoxon test). The detection of one or more mutations was significantly more frequent in patients with a maximum IM dose of 800mg (n=15/17, 88%) compared to less than 800mg (14/26, 53%, p= 0.02 Fisher\u2019s exact test). Multivariate analysis (Wald forward) confirmed that a maximum IM peak dose of 800mg is an independent prognostic parameter to detect a mutation from the L-PCR panel at the time of IM resistance. Conclusions: High sensitive testing with L-PCR detects mutations with 4-fold increased frequency compared to direct sequencing. Mutations, including p-loop and T315I, may be selected by exposure to higher drug levels. The predominance of T315I and E255K/V mutations at a low level is consistent with the findings in newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ALL (Pfeifer et al. Blood 2007).",
