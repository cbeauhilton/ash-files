    "abstract_text": "Introduction: VEXAS syndrome (vacuoles, E1 ubiquitin ligase, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) is a newly recognized inflammatory disorder caused by somatic mutations in the UBA1 gene. Bone marrows from these patients reveal a range of morphological changes in hematopoietic precursor cells. In this study, we aim to assess the laboratory indices and morphologic spectrum of bone marrow pathology in VEXAS syndrome. Methods: We identified 16 cases of VEXAS syndrome. All cases had confirmed UBA1 mutation. We reviewed bone marrow biopsies corresponding to the date of diagnosis. This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. Results: All patients were male with a median age of 73 years - associated autoimmune disorders included Sweet syndrome, inflammatory arthritis, relapsing polychondritis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. 14/16 patients had anemia with median hemoglobin of 10.4 (Range: 6.7- 14.1 g/dL). 15/16 had macrocytosis with median MCV 110.4 (Range: 94.8- 123.1 /fL). 5/16 had thrombocytopenia with median platelet count 174 (Range: 20- 500 x10^9/L). 7/16 had leukopenia with median WBC 3.65 (Range: 2.4- 11.6 x10^9/ L). The ESR and CRP medians were 61.0 mm/hr and 81.5 mg/L, respectively. Karyotype was performed in 12 patients of which 11 were normal and the remaining case showed a complex karyotype. An NGS panel targeting the most frequent myeloid disorder associated gene mutations was negative in 10/15 cases. GS for myeloid mutations revealed pathogenic mutations in 5 patients, involving genes TET2 (2/5), DNMT3A (2/5), and TP53 (1/5). Conclusions: Bone marrow findings in VEXAS syndrome, in this series of 16 patients, are individually non-specific, yet when taken altogether in the overtly abnormal cases, are very suggestive when the clinical index of suspicion is high. In such scenarios, the combined clinical and bone marrow findings should prompt discussion and consideration for UBA1 mutation testing given the significant clinical implications for patient management and prognosis.
