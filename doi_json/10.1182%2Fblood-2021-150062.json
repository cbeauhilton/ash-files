    "abstract_text": "Background: CD30 is emerging as an important biomarker guiding the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and evaluating the efficacy and prognosis of lymphoma. However, there is no standard procedure for specification and interpretation of the pathological detection of CD30 in China. This study intends to evaluate the staining and interpretation concordance of CD30 expression detected by the VENTANA CD30 assay and other multiple immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay in Chinese malignant lymphoma patients. Design: This is a multi-center, observational study enrolling 1,000 adult patients with a diagnosis of histologically confirmed malignant lymphoma in China. Patients, aged 18 years or older at diagnosis and who provided available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples stored within 2 years, with diagnosis of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, large cell transformation of mycosis fungoides, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, peripheral T cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, and pcCD30+ T-cell lymphoproliferative disease were eligible to participate. Exclusion criteria included sample insufficiency for CD30 testing, incomplete sample information, lack of written informed consent. Methods: Each eligible patient provides an available r FFPE sample. Tissue slides obtained from each eligible FFPE sample will be stained by the VENTANA CD30 assay and at least one of the following IHC assays [umAB256 (zhongshanjinqiao) + Ventana BenchMark; Ber-H2 (Maixin) + Ventana BenchMark\uff1bBer-H2 (Maixin) + DAKO; Ber-H2 (DAKO) + DAKO; Ber-H2 (DAKO) + Ventana BenchMark;umAB256 (Zhongshanjinqiao) + Leica; JCM182 (Leica) + Ventana BenchMark;JCM182 (Leica) + Leica; Ber-H2 (DAKO) + Leica]. CD30 expression of all immunostained slides will be independently interpreted as a percentage of CD30 positive cells by trained pathologists. The primary endpoint will be the staining concordance of percentages of positive cells for CD30 expression detected by each of the nine IHC assays and VENTANA CD30 assay (interpreted by expert panel) Secondary endpoints will be the interpretation concordance of pathologists at sites and the expert panel by assessing CD30 expression detected by various IHC assays. Both primary and secondary endpoint will be evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient ICC, Bland-Altman, and Pearson correlation method. Discussion: This planned study will explore more equivalent testing methods to detect the expression of CD30 in Chinese patients with lymphoma.
