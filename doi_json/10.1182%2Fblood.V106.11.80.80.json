    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has become an increasing treatment option for a variety of malignant and non-malignant disease. During immune reconstitution the host is at significant risk for viral infections. Human adenovirus (HAdV) infection is especially in children an important and serious complication. Virus-specific T-cells are essential for the clearance of HAdV, since antiviral chemotherapy has been insufficient to date. We present a new treatment option using virus-specific donor T-cells for adoptive transfer of immunity to patients with systemic HAdV-infection. We isolated in 6 patients with systemic HAdV-infection after SCT virus-specific T-cells of the donor, according to INF-\u03b3 secretion after short in vitro stimulation with viral antigen, resulting in a combination of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Between 5-50x10 3 /kg T-cells were infused for adoptive transfer. For follow-up, the infection and the in-vivo expansion of infused T-cells were evaluated. Isolated cells showed high specificity and markedly reduced but residual alloreactivity in-vitro. In three of four evaluable patients the infused T-cells underwent an in-vivo expansion and in these three patients the viral load decreased in peripheral blood after adoptive T-cell transfer. In-vivo expansion of specific T-cells was dose-independent. T-cell infusion was well tolerated. One patient experienced GvHD\u00b0II of the skin after T-cell transfer. In conclusion specific T-cell immunotherapy as a new treatment approach for children was performed in 6 cases of systemic HAdV-infection after allogeneic SCT. Induction of a specific T-cell response through adoptive transfer has been shown feasible and effective to protect from HAdV-related complications."
