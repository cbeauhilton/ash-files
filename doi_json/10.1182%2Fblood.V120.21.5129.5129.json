    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5129 Background & Aim: This study detected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of deoxycytidine kinase(DCK) gene, cytidine deaminase(CDA) gene in five hematological malignant tumor cell lines, to find connections between sNPs and Cytarabine dose selection in the treatment of some hematopathy. Materials & Methods: Cell line K562, Ka, HL-60, U937, and Raji were cultured. The genomic DNA was isolated by QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit. Designing primes were amplified by PCR to get the related DNA fragments. DCK gene A674G(rs111454937) C1644T(rs72552079), CDA gene A79C(rs2072671) G208A(rs60369023) was genotyped by means of matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry method (MALDI-TOF MS). Results: The genotype of locus A674G(rs111454937) on DCK gene in all five hematology system cell lines was AA; The genotype of locus C1644T(rs72552079) on DCK gene in all five hematology system cell lines was CC. The genotype of locus G208A(rs60369023) on CDA gene in all five hematology system cell lines was GG; For HL-60, U937, and Raji cell lines, the genotype of locus A79C(rs2072671) on CDA gene was AA, while for K562 and Ka cell lines, that was C/A. Conclusions: The genotype of locus A79C(rs2072671) on CDA gene was not all the same in the detected hematological malignant tumor cell lines, while the genotypes of the other 3 loci were same in the 5 cell lines.
