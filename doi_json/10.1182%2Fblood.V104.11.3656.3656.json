    "abstract_text": "The glycoprotein (Gp) Ib-IX-V complex is essential for platelet function. The extracellular domain of GpIb\u03b1 binds to von Willebrand factor (VWF) and rapidly effects shear-dependent platelet rolling, tether formation, adherence and aggregation onto freshly exposed subendothelium. Following VWF binding, GpIb\u03b1 transduces proaggregatory signals through its cytoplasmic domain, and these signals may be modulated by the activity of GpIb\u03b2 and GpV. The expression of GpIb\u03b1, GpIb\u03b2 and GpIX in megakaryocytes also regulates terminal maturation and platelet release (its absence results in Bernard-Soulier syndrome) and there is human genetic and in vitro evidence that the cytoplasmic domain of GpIb\u03b1 regulates megakaryocyte growth and surface expression of the complex. The cytoplasmic domain of GpIb\u03b1 possesses a binding region for filamin A, which links GpIb-IX-V to the platelet cytoskeleton, and there is evidence that filamin A binding to GpIb\u03b1 directs the surface expression of GpIb-IX in CHO cells. To investigate the mechanism of this effect, we examined GpIb\u03b1 biosynthesis in CHO cells stably co-expressing wild-type or mutant GpIb\u03b1 with GpIb\u03b2, GpIX and filamin A. We observed that surface GpIb\u03b1 expression as measured by flow cytometry is enhanced ~ 1 log-order in CHO cells co-expressing human filamin A. In comparison with CHO-GpIb\u03b1\u03b2IX cell lysates, lysates from CHO-GpIb\u03b1\u03b2IX-filamin A cells showed greater amounts of immature (~ 65 kDa), incompletely glycosylated (~ 80 kDa and ~ 90 kDa) and fully mature GpIb\u03b1 (~ 120 kDa), but lesser amounts of the ~ 15 kDa C-terminal peptide released when the extracellular domain of GpIb\u03b1 (glycocalycin) is cleaved by surface proteases. To determine if the effect of filamin A is due to its binding to GpIb\u03b1, we examined GpIb\u03b1 biosynthesis using several mutants of GpIb\u03b1 co-expressed with GpIb\u03b2, GpIX and filamin A. When filamin A binding is eliminated by truncation of GpIb\u03b1 at C-terminal residue 557 or by a deletion in GpIb\u03b1 between amino acids 542\u2013570, the decreased synthesis of mature GpIb\u03b1 is accompanied by nearly complete elimination of all immunodetectable immature GpIb\u03b1 and by increased immunodetectable C-terminal peptide. To corroborate these data and control for cell selection and non-specific secondary structural changes, we examined the expression of three cell lines expressing two additional mutants of GpIb\u03b1 in CHO cells stably transfected with GpIb\u03b2, GpIX and filamin A. The expression of GpIb\u03b1 with a C-terminal deletion between residues 560 and 570 (which inhibits filamin A binding), but not GpIb\u03b1 with alanine substitutions at C-terminal residues 557 through 559 (which converts the sequence RGS to AAA but doesn\u2019t inhibit filamin binding), results in the near-elimination of immature GpIb\u03b1. These results suggest that GpIb\u03b1 binding to filamin enhances the surface expression of GpIb-IX by directing nascent protein trafficking away from a degradative pathway and towards the golgi. This leads to increased glycosylation, which further stabilizes the complex by attenuating the susceptibility of the extracellular domain to proteolytic cleavage.",
