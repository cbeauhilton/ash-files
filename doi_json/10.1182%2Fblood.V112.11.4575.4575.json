    "abstract_text": "Aromatase inhibitors (AI) block the conversion of testosterone and androstenedione to the estrogen estrone by inhibiting the aromatase enzyme complex. AI are used to treat estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer in postmenopausal women. With AI therapy, estrogen levels decrease to 85\u201395% of baseline. In women with metastatic disease, androstenedione levels do not increase. We have evaluated 2 women for polycythemia during AI therapy. Case 1 is 52 years old with stage II breast cancer treated with lumpectomy, TAC \u00d7 6 and radiation. Tamoxifen was started 4 months later. The mean hemoglobin during 6 months of tamoxifen was 14.0\u00b10.1 gm/dl. When switched to exemestane, the mean hemoglobin over the next 24 months was 16.1\u00b10.5 gm/dl (Mann-Whitney, p 0.60). 2 additional women received tamoxifen which was subsequently changed to an AI, 1 of whom had a mean hemoglobin of 12.9\u00b10.3 gm/dl on tamoxifen which increased to 14.9\u00b10.4 gm/dl on exemestane (Mann Whitney, p 1 gm/dl while on AI therapy which decreased back to baseline when switched to tamoxifen. In conclusion, although the numbers are small and the data retrospective, these data suggest that AI therapy may be associated with an increase in hemoglobin in a subgroup of women treated with AI therapy for localized breast cancer. Given that AI have not been shown to significantly increase the systemic androgen level, the mechanism for the increase in hemoglobin remains unclear. A well designed, prospective study is needed to determine if AI have an effect on hemoglobin in women being treated for breast cancer."
