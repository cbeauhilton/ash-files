    "abstract_text": "Background: Severe infectious events after chemotherapy (CHT) are potentially life-threatening. This is directly related to neutropenia. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is used as supporting therapy to prevent neutropenia. Peg-filgrastim has been available in Mexico since 2005 and there is not any report about the use of this drug in Latin America. Aim : To evaluate grade 4 neutropenia and infections related to neutropenia while using peg-filgrastim. Methods : Patients between the ages of 18\u201365, with NHL ( de novo or relapsed) with \u2264 30% bone marrow involvement were eligible. CHT was selected by each institution. Complete blood counts were obtained on days 0 (day before chemotherapy), 7, and 14. Outcomes : Fifty three patients with NHL were included (one withdrew from study after the 2nd cycle of CHT). Three hundred and fourteen cycles were analyzed. Clinical characteristics: Age (mean \u00b1SD): 51.8(\u00b113.5), male: 47%, ECOG \u2265 2:32%), Advance stage (III/IV Ann Arbor): 53%, adjusted IPI (Intermediate/High):60.4%, First-line CHT 72%, second-line CHT 28%. Median neutrophil count (ANM) on day 0 was 8.69 \u00d710 9 /L (IC 95% : 6.44 to 10.94, previous each CHT), ANM on day +7 was 7.9\u00d710 9 /L (IC 95% : 5.34 a 10.45) and day +14 ANM was 8.61 \u00d710 9 /L (IC 95% : 6.74 a 10.48) see figure 1. Neutropenia grade 4 was observed in 12.8% of the cycles, being more frequent on day 7 (90%) it means chemotherapy nadir, see figure 2. Severe infectious events were registered in 0.63% of the global cycles (two pneumonias, one of them when ANC was over 2 \u00d710 9 /L) and non-severe in 1.91% being more frequent superior tract infections. No delays in CHT administration or deaths were reported. Conclusion : Peg-filgarstim could decrease the frequency of grade 4 neutropenia the day before the next administration of CHT as well as the incidence of severe and non-severe infections in young patients.",
