    "abstract_text": "It has previously been shown that addition of rituximab overcomes bcl-2-associated resistance to CHOP in DLBCL patients ( Mounier 2003 ). However, the role of rituximab in the treatment of bcl-2 negative DLBCL is presently unclear. To better understand the molecular mechanisms for CHOP-resistance, the DLBCL cell lines Karpas 422, ULA, WSU-NHL, SU-DHL-8 and SU-DHL-5 were characterised with regard to CHOP- and rituximab-sensitivity. As compared to the other cell lines, Karpas 422 and ULA were CHOP-refractory and WSU-NHL showed an intermediate response to CHOP-treatment. However, SU-DHL-8 and SU-DHL-5 were sensitive to low levels of CHOP. Interestingly, the response to rituximab did not correspond to CHOP-sensitivity, as CHOP-refractory ULA were sensitive to rituximab alone while CHOP-sensitive SU-DHL-8 were refractory. Moreover, when assayed for expression of bcl-2 protein by western blot, SU-DHL-8 and SU-DHL-5 showed a low or undetectable expression while Karpas 422, ULA and WSU-NHL expressed high levels of bcl-2 protein. Hence, low levels of bcl-2 correlated to CHOP-sensitivity and with rituximab-resistance, consistent with results from clinical studies. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin can induce apoptosis of Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloma cell lines, and statin use was associated with reduction in lymphoma risk in the international case-control study EPILYMPH ( Fortuny 2006 ). Yet, statins have been shown to impair the antitumour effects of rituximab by inducing conformational changes of CD20 ( Winiarska 2008 ), questioning the concomitant use of statins and rituximab. To evaluate the effect of simvastatin on the cell death of bcl-2-expressing and \u2013non-expressing cell lines, ULA, SU-DHL-8 and Karpas 422 were incubated with increasing levels of simvastatin. Interestingly, already at levels as low as 2 \u03bcM (corresponding to a daily intake of 10 mg simvastatin), bcl-2-negative SU-DHL-8 cells showed signs of increased cell death. However, bcl-2 expressing ULA and Karpas 422 cells were resistant to levels of simvastatin as high as 50 \u03bcM. Moreover, low levels of simvastatin sensitized SU-DHL-8 cells to CHOP treatment. Taken together, our results may suggest that replacement of rituximab with simvastatin during CHOP-treatment of bcl-2 negative DLBCL could improve treatment responses. However, further studies are warranted to bring this notion to clinical reality.",
