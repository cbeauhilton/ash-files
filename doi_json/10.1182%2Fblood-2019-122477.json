    "abstract_text": "Treatment of older patients with newly diagnosed AML remains challenging, limited by modest response rates with low-intensity therapy and higher levels of toxicity with intensive therapy. We previously reported on a low-intensity backbone of cladribine + LDAC (CLAD/LDAC)alternating with decitabine for older patients with AML, yielding higher rates of CR and improved outcomes compared to historical experience with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) in this setting ( Lancet Haematology 2018). Recently, the combination of the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax with HMAs demonstrated significant improvements in response rates and survival over experience with HMAs alone. We hypothesized that the addition of venetoclax to the CLAD/LDAC backbone may further improve response rates and outcomes for this group of patients. We designed a phase II clinical trial studying the combination of venetoclax with CLAD/LDAC alternating with 5-azacytidine (AZA) in older (age \u2265 60y) or unfit patients with newly diagnosed AML (excluding APL). Induction was cladribine 5 mg/m 2 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 followed by araC 20mg SQ BID on days 1-10. Consolidation/maintenance consisted of 2 cycles of cladribine 5 mg/m 2 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3 + araC 20 mg SQ BID on days 1-10 alternating with 2 cycles of AZA 75 mg/m 2 on days 1-7, for up to 18 cycles. Venetoclax was added on days 1-21 of each cycle with dose adjustments (50-400 mg) for concomitant CYP3A inhibitors. One cycle was 4 weeks and up to 2 cycles of induction were allowed. All patients underwent pre-treatment cytogenetic analysis and mutational testing using a customized 81-gene next generation sequencing panel. MRD was assessed using multiparameter flow cytometry in the marrow at the time of remission. Twenty-six patients have been treated on study, with a median age of 69 yrs (57-84); 11 (42%) pts were \u2265 70 yrs and 1 pt < 60 yrs who was unfit for intensive chemotherapy was enrolled. The baseline patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Among 24 evaluable pts, 18 (75%) achieved a complete remission (CR), 3 (13%) had a CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), and 1 (4%) had CR with incomplete neutrophil recovery (CRn) for a CR/CRp rate of 88% an overall response rate of 92%. The median number of cycles to response was 1 (1-3) and 83% of pts were negative for MRD by multi-parameter flow cytometry at the time of CR. Among 9 evaluable pts with diploid karyotype, the CR rate was 100% with full count recovery. Rates of CR/CRp/CRn among other genetic subgroups are summarized in Table 2. The regimen was well tolerated, with a 4-week mortality of 0%. The median time between cycle 1 and 2 was 32 days. The most frequent grade 3/4 non-heme adverse events were neutropenic fever (n=12), lung infection (7), decreased urine output (2), and acute kidney injury (1). Four (18%) of the 22 responding pts went on for allogeneic stem cell transplant, 1 pt (4%) relapsed, 2 (8%) did not respond, and 19 pts continue on treatment. With a median follow-up of 4 months, the median remission duration and overall survival (OS) have not been reached, with an estimated 3- and 6-month OS rate of 95% (Figure). The combination of venetoclax with CLAD/LDAC alternating with AZA is a lower intensity, well-tolerated, and highly effective regimen for older patients with newly diagnosed AML, producing high rates of MRD negative remission and meaningful blood count recovery. Further study of this approach is warranted.
