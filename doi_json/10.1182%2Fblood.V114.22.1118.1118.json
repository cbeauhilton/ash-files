    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1118 Poster Board I-140 Background The median age of an unselected population of Ph+ CML patients is close to 60 years. In the prognostic classifications (Sokal, Blood 1984; Hasford, JNCI 1998) that were elaborated before the introduction of IM, age was a significant and important prognostic factor. The most recent IM studies have not clarified the prognostic importance of age and IM therapy is still denied to several elderly patients. Aim to asses the relationship between age (less and more than 65 years) and outcome, in CML patients treated front-line in early chronic phase (ECP). Methods We analyzed the data of 559 previously untreated ECP patients who were assigned to receive IM 400 mg daily (76%) or 800 mg daily (24%) in three controlled, prospective studies of GIMEMA (Clin Trials Gov. NCT00514488 and NCT00510926 ; and an observational study of IM 400 mg). The median follow-up is currently 42 (extremes 1 \u2013 64) months. There were 115 patients more than 65 years old (median age 71 years), while 444 (79%) were less than 65 years (median age 46 years). The proportion of patients who were treated with IM 800 mg daily was the same in both age groups. Results The cumulative complete cytogenetic and major molecular response rates were identical in the two age groups (88% vs 88% and 82% vs 83%, respectively). However, overall survival (86% vs 93%, p = 0.01), failure-free survival (72% vs 81%, p=0.03) and particularly event-free survival (calculated based on the intention-to-treat principle, where events were any failure [according to the European LeukemiaNet criteria \u2013 Baccarani, Blood 2006] and treatment discontinuation for any cause) (60% vs 71%, p=0.006) were significantly inferior in the older age group. All these difference were mainly due to comorbidities leading to more deaths in CP (table). Conclusions/Methods These data show that response to IM was not affected by old age. Survival curves were affected because of age-related complications and comorbidities. Age should never be a contraindication to IM treatment.
