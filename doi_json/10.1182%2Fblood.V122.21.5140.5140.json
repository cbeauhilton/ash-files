    "abstract_text": "Background In the U.S. over 14,000 new cancer cases occur annually in people under 21 years of age; approximately 21% of cases are acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and \u223c 30% classify as Burkitt lymphoma (BL). Most cases of ALL and BL are due to malignant B-cells that have acquired disease-defining oncogenic lesions that facilitate their rapid proliferation. To maintain a state of homeostasis, the malignant cells rely heavily on the ability of the internal degradation and recycling systems to match the high rate of protein turnover. As such, the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is central in this operation where it prevents buildup of misfolded proteins while also regulating the availability of anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL2 and MCL1. These observations coupled with the observation that UPS disruption leads to cellular demise have resulted in the development of several proteasome inhibitors (PI). These PI have primarily been examined in adult B-cell malignancies. The feasibility of a bortezomib-containing regimen for use in pediatric malignancies has been examined by the TACL consortium and demonstrated a 73% response rate in relapsed/refractory ALL patients. However, a major limitation of bortezomib-based therapy is an increased incidence of peripheral neuropathy (PN), which was also noted in the TACL study. As such, more potent and reportedly less toxic PI have been developed that seem to carry considerably lower risk for development of PN. Such agents that maintain a high response rate and carry reduced long-term adverse effects are highly desirable in pediatric age patients. Aim Investigation of the novel proteasome inhibitors carfilzomib and MLN9708 (Millennium Pharmaceuticals) in preclinical models of pediatric B-lymphocytic cancer. Methods Representative preclinical models of BL (Raji cell line) and B-ALL (ALL-1 cells) were used in this study. Proteasomal activity was measured using synthetic fluorogenic peptide substrates. Cell viability was measured by MTS assay. Apoptosis was determined by annexin-v/PI staining and mitochondrial membrane permeability (MOMP) was assessed using TMRM followed by flow cytometry. Protein profiling was performed via immunoblot. Results In an effort to understand the effect of carfilzomib and MLN9708 in our pediatric cancer models, we first assessed their ability to inhibit proteasomal activity. While chymotrypsin-like activity, which is the target of both PIs, is inhibited by more than 90% in both cell lines, inhibition (\u223c 35%) of caspase-like function conferred by the b1 subunit was more significantly pronounced in MLN9708 treated Raji and ALL-1 cells. Next we performed an MTS assay to determine the growth inhibitory effects of these PI in vitro. Both PI inhibited the growth of the Raji and ALL-1 cells in a dose dependent manner. Carfilzomib showed a more potent effect (IC 50 \u223c1nM in both cell lines) as compared to MLN9708 (IC 50 \u223c30nM in ALL-1 cells and \u223c50nM in Raji cells). To further understand mechanisms of growth inhibition we examined both tumor cell lines for induction of apoptosis along with corresponding markers. As compared to Raji cells, we observed ALL-1 cells to be more sensitive to the effects of both PI, albeit with MLN9708 (50nM) inducing more cell death (65%) as compared to carfilzomib (10nM, 50% cell death). Further, we observed altered MOMP, cleavage of caspases 9, 3 and PARP-1 were found to occur in both cell lines in presence of carfilzomib or MLN9708. These changes indicate the apoptotic effects of novel PI in ALL-1 and Raji cells are via mitochondrial destabilization and caspase activation. As inhibition of the UPS aids NOXA and BIM (pro-apoptotic BCL2 proteins) mediated cell death, we examined the expression of BCL2 family proteins changes in Raji and ALL-1 cells in response to novel PI. Indeed protein levels of both BCL2 and MCL1 were reduced in carfilzomib and MLN9708 treated cells. Reduced BCL2 expression was more pronounced in ALL-1 cells as compared to Raji cells and downregulation was noted to be dose-dependent. Summary Our data show that both carfilzomib and MLN9708 potently inhibit the viability of malignant ALL and BL cells in vitro. We conclude that PI are promising anti-neoplastic therapeutics that target not only the UPS but also modulate the expression of critical anti-apoptotic proteins. Data from mechanistic studies conducted herein underscore the need for further research in in vivo models of these diseases. Disclosures: Foran: Celgene: Research Funding.",
