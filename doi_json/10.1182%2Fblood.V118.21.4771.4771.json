    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4771 In December 2010, the US Department of Health and Human Services released Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) Objectives for the nation. For the first time in its thirty-year history, US health objectives include rare blood disorders and blood safety (BDBS). HP2020 is a public health program that incorporates current clinical evidence and best practices in medicine and public health to identify public health priorities. The objectives are not clinical practice guidelines. Rather, they are scientifically-based, quantified goals to improve the health of specific populations, such as children and older adults. Their development and implementation necessitate partnerships among governmental agencies, organizations, private companies, and medical and health associations at the local, state and national levels. Partners collaborate on implementing activities to reach targeted health objectives for specific populations using educational campaigns, media and other communication venues. NHLBI led the effort with HRSA, CDC, FDA, and the Office of the Secretary to develop, vet and plan implementation of the BDBS objectives. The development process was based on qualitative research methods such as key informant interviews, semi-structured interviews and categorization of data into patterns. For example, categorization of interview results (\u201cdata\u201d) identified specific objective topics, such as screening for complications and penicillin prophylaxis in sickle cell patients aged 4 months to 5 years. Other BDBS Objective topics are: vaccinations; patient and family referrals; care in a medical home; disease-modifying therapies; avoidable hospitalizations; high school completion; community health education; awareness of carrier status; joint health; and alloimmunization in chronic transfusion. http://healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/default.aspx By sponsoring the BDBS objectives, lead governmental agencies commit to collecting, analyzing and reporting data on progress. We adopted the default target of a 10% improvement for each objective by 2020. If targets for each objective are met, the question will be: What is the impact of reaching these targets on morbidity, mortality and quality of life for patients with sickle cell disease, thalassemias and hemophilia?
