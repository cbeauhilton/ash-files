    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2144 Poster Board II-121 The yield of CD34+ cells collected by apheresis for autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation was greatly increased when the appropriate timing was determined to begin using G-CSF after COAEP mobilization. 29 patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma (MM) received the same mobilization chemotherapy, including CTX 400mg/m2 d1; VDS 2 mg/ m2 d1; Ara-C 60 mg/m2 \u00d75d; vp-16 60 mg/m2 \u00d75d; and prednisone 40 mg/m2 \u00d75d. The control group (12 cases) received subcutaneous G-CSF (filgrastim) at the first restoration after the initial nadir of the peripheral WBC count. The experimental group (17 cases) received G-CSF during the steady rise of the WBC count (end of fluctuating after initial nadir). G-CSF was given in a single daily subcutaneous dose of 300\u03bcg until the final PBSC apheresis.When the peripheral WBC and mononuclear cell (MNC) counts reached 10.0\u00d7109/Land 1.0\u00d7109/L, respectively, leukapheresis was carried out using the COBE Spectrablood cell separator. Despite comparable treatment with alkylating agents, a significantly increased yield of CD34 positive cells was observed in the experimental group (32.0\u00d7106/kg) compared to the control group (3.1\u00d7106/kg) ( P =0.0182). This result indicates the importance of appropriate timing for the use G-CSF after mobilization chemotherapy to increase the CD34+ cell yield.
