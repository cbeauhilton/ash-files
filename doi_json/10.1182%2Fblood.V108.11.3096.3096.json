    "abstract_text": "Systemic light-chain amyloidosis (AL) is a protein deposition disorder and a monoclonal plasma cell disease. Treatment of AL has focused on the reduction or elimination of the clonal plasma cells that make amyloid-forming light chains. High-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant (MEL SCT) is an effective therapy for selected AL patients. At 3 months post-SCT, response of the clonal plasma cell disease can be reliably scored; the achievement of a complete response (CR= immunofixation negative) is usually associated with extended survival while no response (NR= < 50% reduction) is not. Many factors likely contribute to this distribution of responses. In order to identify factors specific to clonal plasma cells, gene expression profiles (GEP; Affymetrix U133 PLUS 2.0) were obtained using FACS-sorted CD138+/DAPI- plasma cells (>95% pure) from untreated AL patients before SCT. Supervised analyses were then performed based on responses at 3 months post-SCT, comparing the CR (n=4) and NR (n=5) groups. The basic analysis was a t-test, filtering genes for differential expression at p<0.01, and those that passed were subject to EASE analysis in order to identify gene ontology families over-represented on the gene list. A secondary filtering selected only genes with two-fold difference in expression between CR and NR, average expression of at least 1000, and inclusion in an EASE group that had a p<0.05. Five genes were identified as over-expressed in the CR group: WARS , SHMT2 , IARS , CALR , and PSMB4 . Our initial validation studies, using purified baseline clonal plasma cells from 11 patients and baseline marrow biopsy specimens from 25 patients, have focused on calreticulin ( CALR ) and tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase ( WARS ). By real-time polymerase chain reaction studies with GAPDH and normal plasma cell controls, the expression levels of CALR were significantly lower in NR patients (p=0.02) while differences in WARS expression did not achieve significance (p=0.25). By immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for CALR in marrow biopsies, a CALR IHC index was developed, with scoring of the fraction of plasma cells expressing CALR (over total CD138 positivity) and intensity of CALR staining (both scored 0, 1, 2 or 3; the scores were multiplied to compute the index, range 0\u20139). CALR-stained marrows were scored blindly. Patients with CALR index of 9 had an 88% likelihood of achieving CR while those with scores of 0\u20136 had a 39% chance (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p=0.046). In sum, calreticulin expression in clonal plasma cells from AL patients is associated with the response to MEL SCT. Further studies are on-going to determine the basis for this association."
