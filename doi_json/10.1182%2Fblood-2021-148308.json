    "abstract_text": "Introduction: All the available CLL therapies differ for relevant aspects as duration of response, mode of administration, treatment duration and adverse events: the CHOICE study was designed to investigate CLL patients' Quality of Life (QoL) and preferences towards different treatment attributes through a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) in Italy. Due to the timeline of the study, started in Feb2020, the collected data offer an insight of patients' perception and attitude during the 1 st wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, as opposed to other DCE results available in CLL (1-2). Methods: This cross-sectional multi-center observational study enrolled patients (pts) with CLL, WATCH&WAIT (W&W) or already TREATED (around 50% each, controlled at site level), who signed the informed consent for study participation. Exclusion criteria were inability to take oral drugs, cognitive disorders that could impair questionnaire's comprehension and concomitant therapy for other malignancies. Pts were asked to fill in 3 QoL questionnaires: EQ-5D-5L, EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ CLL-16, described elsewhere. DCE Questionnaire was composed of 9/10 blocks (for W&W/TREATED, respectively) each composed of 8 comparisons between 2 profiles with the following attributes: \"Treatment and relevant duration\", \"PFS\", \"Possibility of infections\", \"Possible occurrence of organ damage\", \"Possible occurrence of diarrhea\", with levels specified in Fig1. Each patient (pt) was centrally assigned to 1 block of 8 comparisons. Each pt could ask questionnaire explanations to the medical staff but self-completed it on an App specifically developed for the study. Results: 401 pts were enrolled in Italy across 16 centers (Feb-Jul 2020),199 W&W and 198 TREATED pts completed the DCE questionnaire and were included in the evaluable population. Main pts' characteristics are shown in Table 1. 73.7% of TREATED pts were ON-treatment (30.8% in 1st-line, 69.2% in further lines) and 26.3% were OFF-treatment. DCE results showed that W&W pts rated as most important the 'Possibility of infections' (relative importance, RI=36.2%), followed by 'Treatment and Relevant duration' (RI=28.0%), 'PFS' (RI=16.9%), while 'Possible occurrence of organ damage' (RI=12.5%) and 'Possible occurrence of Diarrhea' (RI=6.4%) had lower impact on the preference (Fig 1A). DCE in TREATED pts showed that they gave more importance to 'Treatment and relevant duration' (RI =33.3%) followed by 'Possibility of infections' (RI =28.8%). The RI of the other attributes was lower: 'Possible occurrence of organ damage' (RI =19.4%), 'PFS' (RI =9.8%), 'Possible occurrence of diarrhea' (RI =8.7%, Fig 1B). A sub-analysis stratifying pts from Northern regions (more impacted during the 1 st wave of the pandemic) and Center-Southern regions showed that in W&W pts from North Regions the attribute with a higher impact is 'Treatment and Relevant duration' (RI=40.3%) followed by 'Possibility of infection' (RI=27.2%), while in W&W pts from Central-Southern area, the attribute with a higher impact is 'Possibility of infection' (RI=43.4%) followed by 'Possible occurrence of Organ damage' (RI=21.6%). In TREATED pts no difference between the 2 groups has been shown and the results are consistent with the total population. Conclusions: CHOICE study was planned to understand CLL patients' preferences towards different treatment attributes, but the results have been impacted by the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast to previously published DCEs (1-2), where PFS was the most important attribute, in the CHOICE study pts put much more emphasis on their concerns about possible infections: this could be due to the influence of the 1 st Covid-19 pandemic wave, with the relevant feeling of uncertainty, also due to the great attention that media has dedicated to the issue of infection in general, especially for vulnerable individuals such as CLL pts. The limitation in hospital access during the 1 st wave and the overall need of personal protection (masks usage) and social distancing might have influenced patients' responses too. The \"infodemic\" and the uncertainty had probably such a strong effect on patient's feelings, that PFS was no longer the most important attribute being substituted by the fear of hospitals access and infections. We thereby suggest that the pandemic had a great impact not only on the conduct of the study but also on patients' perception of their disease, if not properly reassured.
