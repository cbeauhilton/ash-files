    "abstract_text": "Abstract 462 The marrow microenvironment in primary myelofibrosis and mouse models of the disease is characterized by increased levels of cytokines which regulate hematopoiesis including CXCL12, BMP4, VEGF and TGF-\u03b2. The observation that TGF-\u03b2null myelofibrotic stem cells fail to transmit the disease by transplantation (Chagraoui et al, Blood 100:3495, 2002) has established an important role for TGF-\u03b2 in disease development. Mice carrying the hypomorphic Gata1 low mutation in which the enhancer that drives gene expression in megakaryocytes (MK) is deleted also develop myelofibrosis with age (Vannucchi et al, Blood 2002;100:1123). To clarify the role of TGF-\u03b2 in development of myelofibrosis in the Gata1 low mouse model, the levels of this factor in plasma and marrow of the mutant mice were measured. Gata1 low mice express normal levels of TGF-\u03b2 in plasma (1.8\u00b10.7 vs 2.1\u00b10.4 ng/mL) and levels of TGF-\u03b2 mRNA (2.9\u00b10.5 vs 1.5\u00b10.3 arbitrary units, p700 particles/field in wild-type and Gata1 low marrow, respectively) indicating that fibrosis, by concentrating TGF-\u03b2 locally, may contribute to disease progression also in Gata1 low mice. To evaluate whether inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling would ameliorate myelofibrosis in this animal model, Gata1 low mice were treated with SB431542 (C22H16N4O3, MW= 384.4), an inhibitor of TGF- \u03b21/activin receptor-like kinases recently demonstrated to prevent renal fibrosis in mice (Petersen et al, Kidney Int 73:705, 2008.). Six males (7-9 months) and 6 females (12 months) were treated with SB431542 as described for renal fibrosis (see Figure). Equivalent numbers of mice treated with vehicle were used as control. Treatment was well tolerated (no deaths) and the SB43542-treated mice were easily recognized by being more active and with shinier coats. At the end of the 4 th cycle, mice were sacrificed and analyzed for disease progression. The results were as follows: Blood: SB43542-treatment did not affect hematocrit levels (43.2\u00b11.2 vs 41.3\u00b10.9 in SB43542- and vehicle-treated mice, respectively), increased platelets numbers [0.34(\u00b10.03)\u00d710 6 /\u03bcL vs 0.2(\u00b10.009)\u00d710 6 /\u03bcL, p<0.01] but platelets remained larger than normal, reduced white blood cell counts [5.2(\u00b10.19)\u00d710 3 /\u03bcL vs 6.5(\u00b10.3)\u00d710 3 /\u03bcL, p4/field). Also, progenitor cell trafficking was not reduced (CD34 pos CD117 pos cells: 1.45 vs 1.2% colony forming cells: 10.8\u00b12.4 vs 8.0\u00b10.1 CFC/\u03bcL). Marrow: Treatment increased total cell number [18.0(\u00b10.7) \u00d710 6 vs 8.2(\u00b10.4) \u00d710 6 /femur, p<0.01] and frequency of erythroid cells (20.5\u00b12.5 vs 13.2\u00b10.7%, p<0.01) but not of MK (40.2\u00b15.7 vs 38.7\u00b10.9%) in the femur. However, fibrosis and microvessel density were reduced (Gomori-Silver and CD34 staining). Increased Mallory staining of bones was observed but the femur became resistant to fracture, suggesting that overall bone structure improved. Spleen: SB43542-treatment reduced spleen weight (0.2\u00b10.6 vs 0.45\u00b10.05 gr, p<0.01) and cell numbers [265(\u00b130)\u00d710 6 vs 385(\u00b15)\u00d710 6 cells, p<0.01]. Therefore, although the frequency of erythroid cells and MK in the organ remained high, overall hematopoiesis in spleen was reduced. Liver: SB43542-treatment restored the morphological appearance of the liver and reduced the frequency of MK (5.9\u00b10.7 vs 20.4\u00b14.7, p<0.01). These improvements were likely not due to an anti-inflammatory effect of the drug because parallel treatments with dexamethasone did not modify disease progression in Gata1 low mice. Conclusion: SB43542-treatment reduced the myelofibrotic traits expressed by Gata1 low mice, confirming that increased TGF-\u03b21 levels play an important role in disease manifestations in this animal model. We have previously published that Aplidin treatment restores the hematopoietic stem cell properties of Gata1 low mice (Verrucci et al, J Cell Physiol,2010, May20, Epub ahead of print). The observation that SB43542-treatment primarily reduced microenvironmental abnormalities suggests that the two drugs may have synergistic effects in the treatment of myelofibrosis.
