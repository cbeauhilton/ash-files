    "abstract_text": "Background: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is an uncommon cause of stroke that mainly affects young adults and children. Initial treatment with heparin followed by wafarin is the mainstay of treatment. Only insufficient experience is available for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Aims: The study aims to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of DOACs such as (Rivaroxaban and Dabigatran) in patients with objectively confirmed CVT. Methods: Data of 46 cases of CVT collected using a standardized case report form. Inclusion criteria were patients diagnosed with CVT, confirmed by CT or MRI imaging. Results: The total number of patients was 46 (9 males and 37 females). The mean age of the patients was 35.2\u00b1 5 years. The most common clinical manifestations among our patients were headache followed by seizure. 52% of cases were unprovoked, while 48% were provoked by pregnancy and oral contraceptive pills. Superior sagittal sinus (55%) and transverse sinus (44.9%) were the most common sites. Involvement of more than three venous sinuses was 34.8%. Thrombophilic abnormality was detected in 21.7% of patients. Initiation of anticoagulation (AC) was mostly low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (80%), followed by unfractionated heparin (UFH) (17.7%) and fondaparinex (2%). Maintenance AC with Rivaroxaban after heparin (LMWH/UFH) was in 63% of our patients, the rest were switched from Warfarin to Rivaroxaban (34.8%), and one was treated by Dabigatran (2%). CVT recurrence was observed in one patient. Major bleeding (according to ISTH criteria) was not reported in our case series. Conclusions: DOACs demonstrated good safety and efficacy profile and can potentially replace warfarin in CVT patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
