    "abstract_text": "Deregulated expression of c-Myc is involved in the pathogenesis and growth of Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma cells. Aberrant NF\u03baB activation has been linked to several forms of cancers, including Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancers, and B-cell malignancies. The cytoplasmic retention of NF\u03baB is mediated by a family of inhibitor proteins, the I\u03baBs. We showed that expression of a super-repressor form of I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b1-SR, resulted in decreased proliferation and an increased G0/G1 population of Raji Burkitt\u2019s cells. No spontaneous apoptosis was observed, but there was increased sensitivity to apoptosis following treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. Further studies were performed to determine the mechanisms involved in the induction of apoptosis. Interference with NF\u03baB activity decreased the levels of c-Myc and Bcl-xL, but there was no change in the levels of Bax, Bak, Mcl-1, or p53. Treatment with chemotherapeutic agents alone resulted in decreased expression of Mcl-1 with no change in the other proteins measured. Decreased expression of both Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 following inhibition of NF\u03baB activity and chemotherapy (vincristine, 4HC or doxorubicin) treatment resulted in apoptosis. In support of the important role of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, siRNA experiments revealed that decreased expression of either one alone did not lead to apoptosis, while decreased expression of both Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 resulted in the induction of apoptosis. Many Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma cells have mutations in p53. We found that the mutated p53 was able to bind to I\u03baB\u03b1 and I\u03ba B\u03b1-SR as well as to Bcl-xL, however, no up-regulation of Bax or p53 was observed in response to a chemotherapeutic agent. This indicates that mutated p53 retains the ability to bind the other proteins but has lost transcriptional function. Introduction of high levels of wild-type p53 into Raji Burkitt\u2019s cells was able to restore the induction of Bax and Mdm2 and induce apoptosis, whereas the mutant was not. These results suggest that sensitization of Burkitt\u2019s cells to apoptotic death with chemotherapeutic agents requires interference with NF\u03baB activity and changes in the expression of Bcl2-family members but is independent of p53. Inhibition of NF\u03baB activity could be useful in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma.",
