    "abstract_text": "Defective inside-out activation of \u03b2 1, \u03b2 2, and \u03b2 3 integrins in platelets and leukocytes is a main characteristic of patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD)-III syndrome. We have recently shown that CalDAG-GEFI, a member of the CalDAG-GEF/RasGRP family of intracellular signaling molecules that catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP bound to Rap1, plays a key role for the activation of \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3 in murine platelets. Here we studied the role of CalDAG-GEFI for neutrophil function as well as the activation of \u03b2 1 integrins in platelets. Neutrophils from CalDAG-GEFI\u2212/ \u2212 mice showed normal surface expression of key adhesion receptors such as L-selectin, PSGL-1, or \u03b2 1/\u03b2 2 integrins. Calcium flux, degranulation, and oxygen radical formation were similar in wild-type (WT) and mutant cells. In contrast, \u03b2 2 integrin-mediated adhesion to fibrinogen was significantly reduced in cells lacking CalDAG-GEFI when compared to controls. In vivo, CalDAG-GEFI-deficient neutrophils showed normal rolling along stimulated venules, while firm adhesion was almost completely inhibited. A similar defect in firm adhesion was observed in WT mice pre-treated with blocking antibodies against \u03b2 2 integrins. To determine the role of CalDAG-GEFI in neutrophil emigration, inflammation was induced in the peritoneum or the skin. In both models, neutrophil infiltration was significantly reduced in CalDAG-GEFI\u2212/ \u2212 mice when compared to controls. We further demonstrate that CalDAG-GEFI regulates the activation of \u03b2 1 integrins in platelets and that CalDAG-GEFI-deficiency leads to a complete inhibition of arterial thrombus formation in mice. Due to its central role in the activation of \u03b2 1, \u03b2 2, and \u03b2 3 integrins, we propose CalDAG-GEFI as a candidate gene defective in LAD-III patients.",
