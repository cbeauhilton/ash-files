    "abstract_text": "Sphingosomal vincristine (SV) is a novel formulation of vincristine encapsulated in sphingomyelin liposomes or \u2018sphingosomes\u2019. SV was well tolerated with 45% ORR in multiply relapsed aggressive NHL ( ASH Abst.  412 , 1999 ). The addition of rituximab to CHOP improves response in aggressive B-cell lymphomas in the elderly ( Coiffier et al., NEJM  2002 : 346 ; 235 \u201342 ). Based on these data, a phase II study of RCHOP, substituting SV for free vincristine, was undertaken in patients with previously untreated aggressive NHL (excluding rituximab if T-cell lymphoma). Methods: Patients were treated with standard dose CHOP that included SV 2.0 mg/m2 without dose capping \u00b1 rituximab 375 mg/m 2 , given every 21 days for 6 to 8 courses ( ASH Abst.  338 , 2002 ). Results: Of 73 patients enrolled in the study, 68 were evaluable for response. Median age was 63 (range 22\u201380). IPI score was 0\u20132 in 44 pts and \u2265 3 in 24 pts. Patients received a median of 6 study treatments (range 1\u20138). ORR was 93% (63/68 pts) with 62 pts achieving CR and Cru (91%), and 1 PR (2%). 3 pts had PD (4%) and 2 were not assessed for response (3%). The median PFS and OS have not been reached at a median follow up of 29.5 months. Responses according to IPI score were as follows:  Results . IPI 0\u20132 (n=44) . IPI \u22653 (n=24) . Total (n=68) .

Overall survival probability was 94% at 28 months (1 death in the group with IPI 0\u20132 and 2 deaths in the group with IPI \u22653). Neuropathy was generally mild (Gr.1\u20132). Hematological toxicities were as follows: 64% Gr.3\u20134 neutropenia, 6% Gr.3 anemia, and 14% Gr.3\u20134 thrombocytopenia. Conclusions: CHOP plus rituximab regimen with sphingosomal vincristine substituted for free vincristine demonstrated promising activity with durable responses similar in both groups of patients with IPI score 0\u20132 and IPI \u2265 3. The treatment was well tolerated with only mild neurotoxicity.",
