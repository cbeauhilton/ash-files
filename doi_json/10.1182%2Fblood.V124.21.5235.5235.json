    "abstract_text": "The objective of the present study was to investigate the reversible effect of HZ08 and daunorubicin(DNR) combined with dimercaptosuccinic acid modified iron oxide (DMSA-Fe3O4) magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in human chronic leukemia cell line K562/A02, and the mechanism potentially involved. The growth inhibition rate of K562/A02 cells was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell apoptosis and intracellular concentration of DNR were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). DAPI staining was used to view apoptotic cellular morphology. Subsequently, transcription levels of MDR1 mRNA and expression levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and caspase-3 were determined by real time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) and Western blotting analysis, respectively. group clearly exhibited more morphological changes (severe structural alterations) than other groups. In addition, transcription of MDR1 gene and protein expression of P-gp and caspase-3 of K562/A02 cells were regulated at the most remarkable extent in DNR-HZ08-MNPs group when compared with other groups. These findings suggest that the remarkable effects of the novel DNR-HZ08-MNPs on multidrug resistant K562/A02 leukemia cells would be a promising strategy for overcoming multidrug resistance.
