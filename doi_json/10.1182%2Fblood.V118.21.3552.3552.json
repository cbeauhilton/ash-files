    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3552 The International Consortium on Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (IC-APL) is an initiative of the International Members Committee of the ASH that aims to improve the treatment outcome of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients in developing countries, which was launched in Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. The protocol is identical to the PETHEMA-LPA2005, except for the replacement of idarubicin by daunorubicin. In our interim analysis, estimated 2-year overall and disease-free survivals are 80% and 90%, respectively. The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 5.6%. The median follow-up among survivors was 23 months (range: 1 \u2013 56 months). A secondary aim of IC-APL was to establish molecular monitoring for minimal residual disease (MRD) as a standard practice for APL patients in these countries and to use the results obtained to guide therapy. According to the IC-APL protocol, testing for the PML-RARA fusion transcript was to be performed at diagnosis, end of induction (optional), after the third cycle of consolidation, and every 3 months during maintenance. Considering that real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) provides a number of advantages compared to conventional non-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), we retrospectively compared the results obtained by both techniques. We analyzed 400 bone marrow (BM) samples from 97 patients with de novo APL enrolled in the IC-APL protocol in Brazil. Of the 97 patients, 78 were considered eligible. The mean age was of 35.8 years with 46 males. Among eligible patients, 49 corresponded to bcr1 ; one to bcr2 and 28 to bcr3 subtype of PML breakpoint. To quantify the fusion transcript PML-RARA we used standardized assays developed in the Europe Against Cancer (EAC) program, normalized to the expression of the ABL gene. The results were compared to plasmid standards (Ipsogen, Marseille) and expressed as Normalized Copy Numbers (NCN). Follow-up samples were considered PCR positive when PML-RARA transcripts amplified with Cycle Threshold (Ct) values of \u226440 in at least 2 out of 3 replicates, according to EAC criteria. A total of 71 samples at diagnosis, 50 at the end of induction, 47 after the third consolidation, 202 during maintenance phase and 30 samples after completion of treatment were analyzed. The median NCN of PML-RARA transcripts at diagnosis was 0.5151 and 0.5092 for the bcr1 and bcr3 subtypes, respectively. At the end of induction there was a reduction of about 3 logs (0.0004 for bcr1 and 0.0005 for bcr3 ). In this phase, six discrepant cases were observed, all presenting positivity by RQ-PCR. None of these cases relapsed and presented consecutive negative results. Considering samples obtained at the end of consolidation, we detected one case of molecular persistence detected by both methods, and two discrepant results, one positive by RT and another by RQ-PCR. Both cases did not relapse. Among samples collected during maintenance and after the end of treatment, two patients (2.5%) relapsed. Both of them were molecular relapses, defined as the detection (in the context of morphological remission) of the PML-RARA transcript by RT-PCR in two consecutive samples collected 15 days apart. RQ-PCR analysis provided much earlier warning of recurring disease, testing positive 5 and 6 months, respectively, before documentation of molecular relapse by conventional RT-PCR assay. Figure 1 show the kinetics of NCN in these two cases. Our results reinforce that the PML-RARA transcript may be detected after induction but this finding was not of prognostic value. However, our study underlines the importance of sequential monitoring to distinguish patients likely to be cured following front-line therapy from those destined to relapse. The RQ-PCR technique was shown to be more sensitive than RT-PCR, providing earlier warning of impending relapse, thereby allowing greater opportunity for successful delivery of pre-emptive therapy. Finally, our results demonstrate that the implementation of the IC-APL allowed the improvement of laboratory standards in parallel to advances in clinical management.
