    "abstract_text": "Abstract 780 Background: The interaction between the cell surface receptor CXCR4 and the chemokine SDF-1 (CXCL12) is critical in signaling between leukemic blasts and the bone marrow microenvironment. We previously demonstrated that CXCR4 is an important mediator of chemotherapy resistance, as chemotherapy-induced upregulation of s-CXCR4 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary samples led to increased SDF-1-mediated chemotaxis and increased protection by normal human bone marrow stroma from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. We also showed that stromal protection and chemotherapy resistance could be reversed by treatment with the FDA-approved CXCR4 inhibitor plerixafor, both in vitro in stromal co-cultures of pre-B cell ALL cell lines and in vivo in xenografts of primary samples of infant MLL -rearranged ALL. Therefore, disruption of the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis is a rational means to target extrinsic survival mechanisms in acute leukemia. The novel Protein Epitope Mimetic (PEM) POL5551 is a selective and potent antagonist of CXCR4. Treatment with POL5551 inhibits vascular accumulation of CXCR4+ smooth muscle cells but its effects on ALL have not been reported. We hypothesized that treatment of ALL cell lines with POL5551 would 1) decrease s-CXCR4 expression, 2) inhibit SDF-1-mediated chemotaxis, and 3) reverse stromal-mediated protection from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Methods/Results: Pre-B cell ALL (697, HB11;19, NALM-6, SEMK2) and T cell ALL cell lines (CCRF-CEM-1301, Jurkat, Molt-4) were treated with dose ranges of POL5551. Cells were harvested at multiple time points over 72 hours and s-CXCR4 was measured by FACS. S-CXCR4 was potently and markedly reduced in all cell lines, with IC50 levels of <5 nM at 1 hour and IC50 levels of <20 nM at 48 hours. In comparison, 3- to 30-fold higher doses of plerixafor were needed to achieve similar levels of reduction. Simultaneous measurement of cell proliferation using the WST-1 proliferation assay demonstrated that treatment with POL5551 neither increased nor decreased leukemia cell proliferation in a significant manner. To ascertain the functionality of s-CXCR4 inhibition, we performed chemotaxis assays. Leukemia cells were treated with 10 nM POL5551 or vehicle control and placed into hanging cell culture inserts. Migration through a permeable membrane toward an SDF-1 gradient was then measured after 24 hours. Compared to control-treated cells, POL5551-treated cells had significantly decreased SDF-1-induced chemotaxis (average 38% reduction in chemotaxis in pre-B cell lines, p<0.001; average 41% reduction in T cell lines, p=0.05). We also performed co-culture experiments with normal human bone marrow stroma in the presence and absence of POL5551 to further demonstrate the functional effects of s-CXCR4 inhibition. Specifically, we cultured leukemia cells off stroma (O), on stroma (S), or pretreated with POL5551 for 30 minutes prior to plating on stroma (P+S). Cells from each culture condition were then treated with dose ranges of chemotherapy. Following treatment, we measured apoptosis by staining with Annexin V/7-AAD. IC10 through IC90 values were obtained using Calcusyn. To quantify stromal protection, we calculated a Protective Index (PI), defined as the S IC values divided by the O IC values. Thus, PI >1 signified stromal protection, while PI \u22641 signified no stromal protection. To quantify the ability of POL5551 to reverse stromal protection, we calculated a Reversal Index (RI), defined as the P+S IC values divided by the O IC values. Therefore, PI > RI indicated a decrease in stromal protection, while RI \u22641 indicated a reversal of stromal protection. Overall, stroma protected leukemia cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Importantly, treatment with POL5551 abrogated stromal-mediated protection and restored chemosensitivity (eg, PI 1.182 vs. RI 0.956 for NALM-6 treated with daunorubicin +/\u2212 20 nM POL5551, p<1\u00d710e-9). Conclusions: The novel CXCR4 antagonist POL5551 is a potent inhibitor of CXCR4 in pre-B and T ALL cell lines with activity at nanomolar concentrations in decreasing s-CXCR4 expression, inhibiting SDF-1-induced chemotaxis, and reversing stromal-mediated protection from chemotherapy in vitro . Therefore, if our findings are confirmed in primary samples and in vivo, interruption of leukemia-microenvironment signaling with POL5551 may prove to be an effective strategy in the treatment of pre-B and T cell ALL.
