    "abstract_text": "Background : Nilotinib is a potent and highly selective BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) patients in chronic (CML-CP) or accelerated phase (CML-AP) who have failed prior therapy including imatinib. Methods : This subanalysis of the open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of nilotinib in elderly (\u226565 years) CML-CP patients who were resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Nilotinib was dosed at 400 mg twice daily. Results : A total of 321 CML-CP patients (71% imatinib-resistant; 29% imatinib-intolerant) were enrolled. Thirty percent (98/321) of patients were \u226565 years; 8% (8/98) of these patients were 3 80 years. The baseline characteristics among patients \u226565 and 500 msec (<1% vs 2%) were also similar among patients <65 years or \u226565 years. Conclusions : Nilotinib is highly active and induced durable clinical responses in CML-CP patients regardless of age. Importantly, the safety profile of nilotinib is maintained in elderly patients and there was no increase in the incidence of cardiac evens making it an excellent therapeutic option for patients with Ph+ CML, regardless of age.",
