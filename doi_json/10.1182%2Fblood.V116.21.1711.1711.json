    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1711 Resistance to chemotherapy is a challenge in treatment of acute leukemia. Although the classic multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype is often characterized by expression of drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein or by multidrug resistance-associated proteins, precise molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. To investigate novel protein changes involved in resistance mechanism, protein expression profiles between human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell lines and adriamycin- resistant HL-60 cell lines (HL-60/ADR) was compared, which was based on a differential proteomic approach \u2014 2 dimensional difference in gel Electrophoresis(2D-DIGE) followed by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and complemented by western blot validation. 16 protein spots were identified as being differentially expressed (> 1.2 fold change and p \u2264 0.05) between above two cell lines, among which 13 protein spots were identified as up-regulated and 3 as down-regulated in the HL-60/ ADR cell line. Proteins found to have higher abundance levels in the resistant HL-60/ADR cells included enzymes, proteins and oncogenes related to signal transduction, protein synthesis, cell growth regulation and metabolism. 3 lower abundance proteins are related to transcription. From 16 proteins, 2 proteins, nucleophosmin B23 (NPM B23)and nucleolin C23, were selected and verified in leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia samples by western blot. Compared to healthy control samples, which showed no expressions of these 2 proteins, leukemic cell lines revealed an obvious up-regulation of B23 and C23. Moreover, significantly higher expressions of B23 and C23 were found in 3 resistant leukemic cell lines, HL-60/ADR, K562/ADR and KG01 cells, compared to the parent HL-60 and K562 cells, and other leukemic cell lines. In de novo leukemia samples, 43.8%(35/80) expressed B23 and C23 proteins, 37.9% (22/58) AML and 59.1% (13/22) ALL respectively. Meanwhile, concomitant expression of B23 and C23, both positive or negative, was noted in 97%(79/80)patients. Over-expressions of B23 and C23 were observed in 68.8% relapased/refractory leukemia patients. With regard to treatment outcome,among those patients who achieved ongoing CR, fewer patients expressed 2 proteins, only 13.35% (7/52) AML and 46%(7/15) ALL respectively. It implicated that B23 and C23 may be involved in drug resistance and be useful in assessing treatment outcome and prognosis of leukemia. To a conclusion, these results provide a novel clue for the molecular mechanism of MDR and suggest that B23 and C23 are prognostic indicators for leukemia.
