    "abstract_text": "Background: Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL), is a rare aggressive B-cell lymphoma that shares many overlapping characteristics with activated B-cell type diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) and multiple myeloma (MM). High expression of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway molecules has been linked with several aspects of tumour biology in ABC-DLBCL and MM. In MM Wnt/\u03b2-catenin play critical role in chemoresistance, while high FOXP1 in ABC-DLBCL exert poor prognosis through up-regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. There is strong evidence that enhanced crosstalk between the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and RAS pathways impact tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancerous stem cells in various cancers. In breast cancer; targeting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and RAS pathways with small molecular inhibitors have shown effective results. The role of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway and its corresponding linkage to RAS signalling molecules remained unknown in PBL. This pilot study provides preliminary data in relation to expression of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and RAS pathways molecules in PBL in contrast to ABC-DLBCL. Method: FFPE RNA from diagnostic tissue samples in PBL patients (n=31) were compared with ABC-DLBCLs (n=18) patients for key Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and RAS pathway molecules expression, utilizing nCounter (NanoString Technologies) platform. Qlucore Omics Explorer software was employed with defined criteria (fold change >2.0; p<0.01 and q <0.05) for statistical analysis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) from 5 publicly available gene data sets was used to analyze the expression of other accompanying pathways. Result: We identified significant differential expression of mRNA related to Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling between ABC-DLBCL and PBL (Figure 1). Expression of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling inhibitors ( CXXC4, SFRP2, and DKK1 ) were significantly higher among PBL compared to ABC-DLBCL (8.12-3.22 log fold difference). In divergence, molecules linked with Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling activation were elevated in PBL when compared to ABC-DLBCL ( FZD3 and WNT10B ). The GESA analysis proved that the RAS pathway was significantly up-regulated in PBL patients compared to ABC-DLBCL. In particular, the expression of crucial RAS pathway genes such as NRAS, RAF1, SHC1 , and SOS1 was significantly up-regulated in PBL patients when compared to ABC-DLBCL patients (Figure 2). Conclusion: Our data suggest that the expression of Wnt/B-catenin target genes and ligands are enhanced in PBL patients along with the up-regulation of the RAS signalling pathway molecules as compared to ABC-DLBCL. The heightened expression of crucial Wnt/B-catenin inhibitors does not down-regulate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling. We anticipate that the combined down-regulation of the Wnt/ \u03b2-catenin and RAS pathways by targeting its key members ( RAF1, NRAS, FZD3 ) may serve to contain tumor progression in PBL, hence impacting prognosis.
