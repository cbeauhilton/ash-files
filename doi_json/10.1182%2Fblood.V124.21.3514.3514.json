    "abstract_text": "Introduction Saddle pulmonary embolism (PE), defined as thrombi at the bifurcation of pulmonary artery, occurs in about 2-5% of all PE cases. Due to relative rarity of this condition, studies aimed at describing the clinical attributes and outcomes have been limited by small sample size. Although clot burden was once believed to be important prognostically, recent data has challenged this assumption. Methods We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to identify all hospitalizations related to acute pulmonary embolism in the United States from the year 2009 to 2011. Nationwide Inpatient Sample is the largest all-payer publicly available inpatient care database in the US. It contains data from five to eight million hospital stays from about 1,000 hospitals across the country and approximates a 20% sample of all US hospitals. Using the appropriate International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes, the study cohort was divided into saddle and non-saddle groups. Baseline demographic and hospital characteristics, comorbidities, in-hospital mortality and complications were compared between the two groups. Data analysis was done using STATA, version 13.0 (College Station, TX). Results A total of 861,762 acute PE related hospitalizations were identified during the study period. Saddle PE was coded in 1472 (0.16%) hospitalizations. A significantly greater proportion of saddle PE cases were seen among males (p =0.01), obese (p<0.001), dyslipidemic (p<0.001) and diabetic patients (p<0.001). Although the in-hospital mortality rate was similar in the two groups (3.62% versus 3.19%, p=0.73), rates of cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure and thrombolysis were significantly higher in saddle PE. Conclusion Saddle PE carries similar prognosis compared to patients without this finding. Whether thrombolytics are necessary in hemodynamically stable patients is a matter for further study.
