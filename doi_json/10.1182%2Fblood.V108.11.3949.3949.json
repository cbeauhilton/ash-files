    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a clinico-pathological entity that presents a diagnostic challenge, especially in medically complex patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this observational and prospective study, 34 consecutive patients with suspected HIT were enrolled. They were clinically scored using two different clinical scoring systems and underwent testing for PVS-ELISA and 14 C-SRA. 14 C-SRA results were also available from 21 medical and surgical patients who had previously been tested. PURPOSE: The objective of our study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the PF4 ENHANCED (GTI Diagnostics) ELISA for HIT performed at two institutions using the serotonin-release assay ( 14 C-SRA) and clinical scoring systems as reference methods. RESULTS: With the 14 C-SRA as the reference method, the sensitivities and specificities of the ELISA were 100% and 57% respectively at one institution and 93% and 65% at the other. There was only one false-negative ELISA with the 14 C-SRA as the reference standard. When compared with the clinical scoring by Greinacher et al., the sensitivity and specificity for PVS-ELISA was 81.82% and 50% and for 14 C-SRA 40% and 100% respectively. Five of eleven patients who scored \u2019Very Likely\u2019 by the Greinacher scoring system were either \u2019Unlikely\u2019 or \u2019Possible\u2019 with the Paulpard scoring system. Seven of 11patients with \u2019Very likely\u2019 HIT and 7 of 8 with \u2019Possible\u2019 HIT by Greinacher clinical criteria were 14 C-SRA negative. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did confirm the high specificity of 14 C-SRA, however the sensitivity was low with clinical scoring as reference standard. Clinical scoring was discordant in more than 50% of patients with \u2019Very Likely\u2019 HIT by Greinacher score when compared with Paulpard scoring. Thus neither the clinical score nor the 14 C-SRA appears suitable as the \u2019gold standard\u2019 for diagnosis of HIT. Because of its high sensitivity with the 14 C-SRA as the reference method, we believe the PF4 ENHANCED ELISA should be used to identify HIT in patients with multiple potential causes of thrombocytopenia, although false-positive results will not be uncommon."
