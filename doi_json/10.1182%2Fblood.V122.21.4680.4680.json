    "abstract_text": "Background & Purpose Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in sickle cell disease (SCD) is an important risk factor for complications including sudden death. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of PH and correlate the echocardiographic parameters and general laboratory data with markers of hemolysis and serum NT pro-brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] concentrations in Omani SCD patients. Methods A cohort of 163 SCD patients [Mean age 25.4\u00b18.4 years], in steady state was prospectively screened for PH with Doppler echocardiography (defined as a tricuspid regurgitation jet flow velocity of \u2265 2.5 m/sec and/or mean pulmonary artery pressure [mPAP] \u226525 mmHg). After a written informed consent, all patients were investigated with a complete blood count, renal chemistry, hemolytic parameters including LDH, haptoglobin, liver function tests, coagulation studies, HPLC studies including HbS and HbF level estimations, X ray Chest, ECG, ABG, Pulmonary function tests, Pulse oximetry, and Serum NT pro-BNP levels. Results In the evaluable patient cohort of 116 subjects [63 females, 53-males], the prevalence of PH was 5.2%. No statistically significant differences were detected in Hb levels, ECG, chest radiography, pulmonary function tests between patients with and without PH. However, plasma NT pro-BNP levels were significantly correlated with PAH [r=0.934, p<0.000], TRV jet [r=.671, p<0.000], Abnormal ECHO [r=0.672, p<0.000], and direct Bilirubin levels [r=0.278,p<0.009] in SCD patients. Furthermore, in SCD patients with PH, there was a statistically significant increase in plasma NT pro-BNP levels [ p<0.001], ALT [p<0.02], S. Creatinine [p=0.045] and Total bilirubin [p<0.0001] and direct Bilirubin levels [p<0.0001][Table].    View Large Conclusions Serum NT pro-BNP is a strong indicator of PH in SCD patients. Doppler ultrasound echocardiography is a useful initial screen for PH in SCD patients. The correlation between PH and hemolytic markers suggests an implication in the pathogenesis of PH.
