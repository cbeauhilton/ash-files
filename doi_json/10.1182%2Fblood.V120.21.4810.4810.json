    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4810 The knowledge of oncogenic signaling pathways of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is still limited. Constitutive aberrant activation of NF-\u03baB signaling has been detected in various lymphoid malignancies and plays a key role in the development of these malignancies. The zinc finger-containing protein A20 (also known as Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha-Induced Protein 3 or TNFAIP3) is a central regulator of multiple NF-\u03baB activating signaling cascades. A20 is inactivated and results in constitutive NF-\u03baB activation in tumor cells. A20 is now known to act as a crucial tumor suppressor in various hematological malignancies like lymphomas. MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1) plays a critical role in the regulation of NF-\u03baB pathways, and mediated rapid proteolytic cleavage and inactivation of A20. To further characterize the function of these signal molecules, we analyzed the expression levels of A20, NF-\u03baB and MALT1 genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 19 patients newly diagnosed with T-ALL (aged 4\u201370 years, median 25), and investigated the relationship between the aberrant expressions of these genes and T-ALL. Twenty-nine healthy individuals (aged 20\u201357, median 28) served as controls. We found that the expression levels of A20 in T-ALL patients (6.057\u00b15.275) were significantly lower than healthy group (9.865\u00b15.370) ( P =0.020), while the expression levels of NF-\u03baB (0.560\u00b10.425) and MALT1 (2.712\u00b13.127) in T-ALL patients were significantly higher than healthy group (0.337\u00b10.311, 0.713\u00b10.464) ( P =0.041, P =0.001). The expression levels of A20 had a significant negative correlation with the expression of MALT1 ( r =\u22120.628, P =0.009), and the reduced levels of A20 had a positive correlation with the increased expression of NF-\u03baB in T-ALL ( r =0.588, P =0.017). In conclusion, the overexpression of MALT1 in T-ALL causes constitutively cleavage and inactivation of A20 to enhance NF-\u03baB signaling, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of T-ALL. Thus, MALT1 may consider as a potentially attractive target for the development of T-ALL therapeutics. Disclosures: Ma: National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 91129720): Research Funding.
