    "abstract_text": "The optimal management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is increasingly reliant upon molecular studies. Loss of response to imatinib in CML is most commonly associated with selection for a limited number of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations that impair the ability of imatinib to effectively bind to BCR-ABL Molecular understanding of imatinib resistance mechanisms has led to the development of effective \u201csecond generation\u201d BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib and nilotinib, which have clinical activity against most, but not all, drug-resistant mutations. Analysis of the BCR-ABL kinase domain in patients who develop resistance to second-generation inhibitors has implicated further selection of drug-resistant BCR-ABL kinase domain mutants in nearly all cases reported to date. Encouragingly, the number of resistant mutations capable of conferring clinical resistance to the most clinically-advanced second-generation agents, dasatinib (approved by the US FDA and EMEA) and nilotinib (approved in Mexico and Switzerland), appears to be restricted to a relatively small number of amino acid substitutions. As clinical experience with dasatinib and nilotinib grows, an understanding of the relative sensitivities of dasatinib- and nilotinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants to other kinase inhibitors, both approved and investigational, is critical to optimize clinical outcomes in patients with resistance to dasatinib or nilotinib. At the present time, kinase inhibitor therapy options for patients with resistance to one of these agents include the investigational options bosutinib and MK-0457 (VX-680), as well as dasatinib and nilotinib (for patients not yet exposed to one of these agents) and re-exposure imatinib. It is likely that the success of therapeutic intervention in these cases can be predicted based upon the preclinical sensitivity of the mutation(s) involved with the agent chosen. We have therefore conducted a thorough biochemical and biological cross-analysis of the activities of each of these clinically-useful kinase inhibitors against mutations that confer clinical resistance to dasatinib or nilotinib. These studies provide clinicians with a useful reference for choosing an appropriate kinase inhibitor based upon the identity of the resistant BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation(s) detected at the time of relapse when faced with a patient who has lost response to dasatinib or nilotinib. It is hoped that the application of such \u201cpersonalized medicine\u201d strategies to the clinical management of CML cases will further improve outcomes in patients treated with kinase inhibitor therapy.",
