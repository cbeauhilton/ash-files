    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2992 \u03b27 integrin (\u03b27), a well studied integrin chain, associates with either the \u03b14 or \u03b1E chains to form a heterodimer on the cell surface. While it plays a key role in the migratory activities of hematopoietic progenitors and mature effector cells in the periphery, the overall importance of \u03b27 in adult hematopoiesis remains controversial. We have recently identified a small subpopulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (BM) that express \u03b27 integrin at steady state. These \u03b27 + HSCs are capable of long-term reconstitution of both the lymphoid and myeloid compartments, ruling out the possibility that \u03b27 expression on HSCs constitutes a marker for a homogeneous lineage-restricted progenitor population. We also found that these \u03b27 + HSCs have an inherent advantage over \u03b27 \u2212 HSCs in competitive reconstitution assays. Loss of \u03b27 results in the retention of HSCs in the BM and reduced HSC reconstitution potential. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that \u03b27 deficient HSCs downregulated the chemokine receptor Cxcr4. Furthermore, blockade of the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin ligand, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), exhibits a similar phenotype in HSC retention and competitive reconstitution. Interestingly, we discovered that \u03b27 deficient mice have enhanced survival and faster hematopoietic recovery after 5-fluorouracil-induced myeloablative stress, indicating that the decreased engraftment of \u03b27 deficient HSCs may not due to a functional defect, but rather is more likely caused by impaired homing capabilities. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that \u03b27 integrin is essential for HSC homing during the transplantation process. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
