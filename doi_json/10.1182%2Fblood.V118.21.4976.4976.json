    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4976 Between January 2002 and December 2010, we treated 207 NHL at the Hospital de Cli\u0301nicas, Uruguayan University Hospital. These are 10 % of the NHL diagnosed in our country. There were 72 Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), 34 Follicular Lymphoma (FL), 33 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, 11 Mantle Cell, 10 T Cell, 7 MALT, 7 Anaplasic T, 6 Burkitt, 6 Lymphoblastic Lymphoma, 5 Lymphoplasmocytic, 4 Mycosis Fungoides, 3 Burkitt like, 2 Hairy cell Leukemia, 2 Esplenic Marginal zone, 2 LLGG, 2 angioinmunoblastic, 1 Prolymphocytic Leukemia. The mean of this retrospective study is to analyze the improvement in Overall Survival (OS) with the use of R in DLBCL and FL in HIV negative Uruguayan patients. The DLBCL were 72 patients, we analyze 61 because 5 were HIV positive and 6 were Primary CNS. There were 34 males and 27 females. The median age was 60 years (25-82). At diagnostics, the Ann Arbor Stratification was: 26 I-II, 10 with B symptoms, 35 III \u2013 IV, 20 with B symptoms. Nineteen (31 %) had Bulky disease and 18 (30 %) were primary extranodal disease. The International Prognostic Index was: 30%: 0\u20131; 28,5 %: 2; 28,5 %: 3; 13 %: 4. The delay between the first consult and treatment was 31 days (1-456). The Chemotherapy regimens used were in 35 CHOP-like (CHOP, CAPVE, CEOP, CMVP, CVP, m-BACOD) with a median of cycles of 6 (1-8), and in 22 R-CHOP with a median of cycles of 6 (1-8). Results DLBCL: In DLBCL treated with CHOP-like regimens the Overall Response (OR) (Complete Remission (CR) and Partial Remission (PR)) was 60 % with 37 % of CR and 23 % of PR. With R-CHOP the OR was 100 %, CR: 91 % and PR: 9 %. With a median of follow up of 23 month (0,8-106), the OS in patients treated with CHOP-like is 34,3 months and in R-CHOP it has not been reached yet, but it is not statistically significant: log rank (p=0,121). The OS at 24 months is 52 % in CHOP-like vs 80 % in R-CHOP. These results are very promising for the R- CHOP group. The Disease Free Survival (DFS) was 39,6 month (IC: 0\u2013114,4) in CHOP-like and it has not been reached yet in patients with R-CHOP, but this is not statistically significant, log rank (p= 0,645). At 24 month the DFS was 60 % in CHOP-like and 67 % in R-CHOP. There were 34 patients with FL, we analyze 33 because we exclude HIV +. There were 19 females and 14 males. The median age was 62,5 years (33-79). At diagnostics, the Ann Arbor stratification was: 8 patients I -II, 3 with B symptoms, 25 III \u2013 IV, 12 with B symptoms. Twelve percent were bulky and 15 % begun with extranodal disease. Forty four percent had FLIPI 0\u20131, 36 % FLIPI 2 and 20 % 3 or more. The histological grade was in 3 % G1, 79 % G2 and 18 % G3 (15 % G3a and 3 % G3b). The median delay between the first consult and diagnostic was 24 days (5-765). The Chemotherapy regimens used were: in 18 patients CHOP like (CHOP, CAVPE, m-BACOD), median number of cycles 5 (1-6), in 9 patients R-CHOP with median of cycles of 6 (3-8) and in 3 patients R-CHOP-like (R-CAPVE, FCR, R-CVP), median of cycles 5 (3-6). Results FL: In FL treated with R-CHOP or R-CHOP-like regimens the OR was 92 % with 59 % CR and 33 % PR. With CHOP-like regimens the OR was 55 % with 17 % CR and 38 % PR. With a median follow up of 36 month (3-111), the median OS hasn't been reached. The OS at 24 and 36 month in patients treated with R-CHOP or R-CHOP-like was 82 % and 58 %, and in patients treated with CHOP-like 82 % and 67 % respectively. These are not statistically significant, log rank p=0,923. The median Progression Free Survival (PFS) in patients treated with CHOP-like regimens was 17 month (0-44) and it hasn't been reached in treated with R-Chemotherapy (R-CT). The PFS at 24 and 36 month was 36 % and 18 % in CHOP-like patients and 68 % and 55 % in R-CT patients. These difference also is not statistically significant, log rank p=0,66, but there is a great trend in benefit of R-CT. Discussion and conclusion: the use of the monoclonal antibodies in NHL's treatment has been an important issue and it is now use in first line treatment because it's benefits in OR, CR and OS. R was introduced in Uruguay in 2005 and it is government funded through Fondo Nacional de Recursos. In our series, there is an improvement in CR and a trend towards better results in OS and DFS when R-CHOP is used. In spite of the fact that it was not possible to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in view of the low number of patients, we think that this sample is highly representative of the reality of our country.
