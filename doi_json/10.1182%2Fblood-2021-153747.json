    "abstract_text": "Venetoclax (VTX) is a selective small-molecule inhibitor of BCL-2 that exhibits antitumoral activity against MM cells presenting lymphoid features and those with translocation t(11;14). Despite its impressive clinical activity, VTX therapy for a prolonged duration can lead to drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms of resistance in order to develop strategies to prevent or overcome resistance. In the present study, we established four VTX resistant human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) from four sensitive HMCLs, including three with t(11;14), in culture with a stepwise increase in treatment dose with VTX. To identify the molecular basis of acquired VTX resistance, whole exon sequencing (WES), mRNA-sequencing (mRNAseq), and protein expression assays were performed in the four isogenic VTX-sensitive/resistant HMCLs and three MM patients with samples collected before VTX administration and after clinical resistance to the drug. Compared with sensitive cell lines and patient samples collected before VTX administration, mRNAseq analysis identified downregulation of BIM and upregulation of BCLXL in both resistant cell lines and MM cells from relapse patients. Other transcriptional changes detected included upregulation of AURKA, BIRC3 , BIRC5, and IL32. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes suggested involvement of PI3K and MAPK signaling, likely associated with cytokines, growth factors (EGF, FGF and IGF family members), and receptor tyrosine kinase (EGF and FGF). Western blot analysis was performed to compare BCL2 family expression in resistant cell lines versus sensitive cell lines and it showed upregulation of BCL2 survival members (such as MCL-1 and BCLXL), and downregulation of pro-apoptotic BH3 members (such as BIM and PUMA). BIM expression was completely lost in one resistant cell line, and introduction of exogenous BIM into this cell line enhanced VTX sensitivity. Interestingly, BCL2 was upregulated in some resistant cell lines generated after a long-term treatment with VTX, suggesting BCL2 expression level may not be suitable as a marker of VTX sensitivity for acquired resistance. Unlike in CLL, BCL2 mutations were not identified through WES in any resistant cell lines or primary patient sample harvested after relapse. While 8 genes were mutated in two resistant samples , no clear mutational pattern emerged . Based on the above, we further tested some specific inhibitors in in vitro or ex vivo cell models to help understanding resistant mechanism and identify strategies to overcome VTX resistance. We found that inhibition of MCL-1, with the compound S68345, substantially enhanced VTX sensitivity in three resistant HMCLs and in primary cells from one relapsed MM patient. A BCLXL inhibitor (A155463) only significantly enhanced VTX sensitivity in one resistant cell line after co-treatment with VTX. Co-treatment of the other three resistant cell lines with VTX, S68345 and A155463 resulted in the most synergistic anti-myeloma activity, suggesting those cell lines are co-dependent on MCL-1, BCLXL, and BCL2 for survival, although they are more dependent on MCL-1. We also found that inhibition of PI3K signaling, IGF1, RTK (EGF and FGF) and AURKA significantly increased VTX sensitivity, partially through downregulation of MCL-1, and BCLXL, and upregulation of BIM. Conventional anti-MM drugs such as dexamethasone, bortezomib and lenalidomide, were shown to have little activity on augmenting VTX sensitivity in most resistant cell lines. In summary, we find that acquired resistance to VTX in MM is largely associated with BCL2 family regulation, including upregulation of survival members such as MCL-1, BCLXL, BCL2, and downregulation of pro-apoptotic members, especially BIM. Our study also indicates that upstream signaling involved in BCL2 family regulation during acquired resistance is likely related to cytokine, growth factor, and/or RTK-induced cell signaling such as PI3K. Co-inhibition of MCL-1, or BCLXL, as well as the upstream PI3K, RTK (FGF and EGF), IGF-1 mediated signaling were effective in overcoming VTX resistance.
