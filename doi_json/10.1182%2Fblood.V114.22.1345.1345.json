    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1345 Introduction Thrombus stability is provided by very large polymers adhering to platelets and anchoring the thrombus to the vessel wall. The best described polymers are fibrin and von Willebrand Factor (VWF). Activated neutrophils and other leukocytes can form an extracellular fibrous network which is composed of DNA, histones, and granular proteins. These neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are present in various inflammatory diseases. In deep vein thrombosis (DVT) inflammation closely cooperates with thrombosis. Here we examine whether NETs provide a new means to support the adhesion and recruitment of platelets and whether NETs are present in DVT. Methods and Results: To study the interaction of platelets with NETs, we isolated human neutrophils, induced NET formation and perfused over the NETs human platelets in plasma or whole blood anticoagulated with the thrombin inhibitor PPACK. Microscopic analysis revealed that under flow platelets adhere avidly to NETs. Perfusion of whole blood at physiological shear resulted in formation of thrombi on NETs in a time dependent manner. Addition of DNase1 degraded NETs and removed all platelets and thrombi demonstrating their adhesion to NETs. Thrombus formation on NETs was absent if blood was supplemented with EDTA indicating the requirement for divalent cations. Perfusion of NETs with heparinized blood dismantled NETs and prevented thrombus formation. Incubation of NETs with heparin alone released histones from NETs, indicating that heparin destroys the chromatin backbone of NETs. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry revealed that NETs were able to bind platelet adhesion molecules VWF and fibronectin from human plasma. Immunohistochemical analysis of a baboon deep vein thrombus showed abundant extracellular chromatin which co-localized with fibronectin and VWF. Conclusions: We show that extracellular traps are able to promote thrombosis in vitro and are abundant in vivo in DVT. We propose that extracellular chromatin provides a new type of scaffold that promotes platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation and may be important for thrombus initiation or stability.
