    "abstract_text": "Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is one of the most common pre-malignant conditions and is characterized by a circulating population of clonal B-cells with an absolute clonal B-cell count < 5x10 9 /L and no evidence of lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, or cytopenias. MBL can be classified by the immunophenotype: CLL-like MBL (CD5+, CD20dim), atypical MBL (CD5+, CD20+), or non-CLL-like MBL (CD5-, CD20+), as well as by the size of the clone (low-count or high-count) with low-count MBL (LC-MBL) defined as clonal B-cell <0.5x10 9 /L or percent clonal B-cell count <85% out of total B-cell count. The prevalence of MBL varies depending on detection methods and population tested. In a Spanish screening study of 608 individuals, they identified 73 MBLs (12%) with CLL-like MBL; moreover, these authors also evaluated overall survival (OS) compared to 290 individuals without MBL and found a significantly shorter OS among these predominantly LC-MBLs. Here, we evaluate the prevalence and OS of LC-MBL in a large screening cohort of 8,297 individuals. Study participants from the Mayo Clinic Biobank, a large-scale biorepository of adult patients, who had no prior history of hematologic malignancy, provided blood samples between 7/2009 to 4/2021. Stored peripheral blood mononuclear cells were screened for MBL with an eight-color flow cytometry assay capable of detecting clonal B-cell event to the 0.005% level. We classified each MBL by immunophenotype as CLL-like MBL, atypical MBL, and non-CLL-like MBL. Individuals with more than one immunophenotype were classified into one immunophenotype based on the following hierarchy: CLL-like MBL, then atypical MBL, then non-CLL like MBL. Based on previously published evidence, individuals were also classified by clonal counts using the percent clonal B-cell count <85% out of the total B-cell count to define LC-MBL. Individuals were followed from sample date to the earliest of death, loss to follow-up, or 5/31/2021. OS for LC-MBL and controls (individuals who screened negative for MBL) was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method. Age- and sex-adjusted OS was analyzed using inverse weights methods. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for age and sex. We screened 8,297 individuals 40 years or older (median age 67 years, 39% male) and identified 1,326 (16%) with LC-MBL and 6,651 (80%) controls. Those individuals detected with high-count MBL (N=90, 1%) or individuals who had insufficient cells for flow cytometry interpretation (N=230, 3%) were excluded from subsequent analyses. The prevalence of LC-MBL was higher in males (21%) than females (14%; p= 65 (P=0.68). Among females, OS was longer among LC-MBL compared to controls (HR=0.61, CI=0.38-0.97, P=0.04); but no evidence of a difference in OS among males was observed (HR=1.22, CI=0.92-1.62, P=0.17). When we evaluated OS by MBL immunophenotype, we observed no statistically significant difference (Fig 1b, log rank P=0.44). When we stratified the MBLs by immunophenotype versus controls, we also did not observe a difference: CLL-like (HR=0.91, CI=0.71-1.18, P=0.5), atypical (HR=1.73, CI=0.92-3.27, P=0.09), non-CLL like (HR=0.98, CI=0.58-1.66, P=0.95). In the largest MBL screening cohort to date, LC-MBL was a common condition among adults 40 years or older reaching a prevalence as high as 29% among individuals 80 years of age or older. OS among those with and without LC-MBL was similar, regardless of immunophenotype and age. The longer survival in females with MBL versus controls requires further evaluation.
