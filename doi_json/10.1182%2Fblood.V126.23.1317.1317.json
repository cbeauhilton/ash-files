    "abstract_text": "Management of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in the elderly is particularly difficult as life expectancy is highly variable and the benefit-risk ratio of treatment depends on comorbidities and age-related pharmacological specificities. Objective : To define the prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and complete remission (CR) and establish a feasible and efficient new prognostic scoring system to assist clinicians in an age-adapted treatment strategy. Methods : From January 2000 to December 2014, 163 patients (pts) presenting an AML in a French regional cancer center in Nice were retrospectively analyzed. According to functional status, patients were treated with induction chemotherapy, azacitidine or palliative care. Complete remission rate (CR) and early-death rate were calculated. Six-month, 1-year and 2-year overall survival (OS) were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done and a p-value <0.1 and 0.05, respectively, were considered statistically significant. Population : From January 2000 to December 2014, 163 pts \u00b3 65 years were included; median age was 73.3 years (65-94.6), with 94 men (57.7%). PS was 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 for 33 pts (20.3%), 77 pts (47.2%), 22 pts (13.5%), 20 pts (12.3%) and 6 pts (3.7%), respectively. Modified Charlson Score (calculated without considering age and leukemia criteria) was 0-1 and \u00b32 for 83 pts (50.9%) and 77 pts (47.2%), respectively. Secondary AML represented 44.2% of this elderly population. Induction chemotherapy was either full-dose cytarabin-daunorubicin 3+7, or cytarabin-idarubicin or cytarabin-clofarabine. Palliative care consisted of hydroxyurea and etoposid chemotherapy and best supportive care. Then, 112 pts (68.7%), 21 pts (12.9%) and 30 pts (18.4%) were treated with induction chemotherapy, azacitidine and palliative care, respectively. Among the 112 pts (68.7%) induced, 56 pts (35.9%) reached CR, 42 pts (25.8%) with a first induction and 14 pts (10.1%) with salvage chemotherapy. Otherwise, 39 pts (23.9%) ended up relapsing. Taking into account the entire treatment, 42 pts (25.8%) received azacitidine. Results : The 6-month, 1-year and 2-year OS for the entire cohort of 163 patients were 64.3%, 46.7% and 24.4%, respectively. Administration of induction chemotherapy was significantly predictive of CR (50% vs 2.0%, p<0.001) and almost predictive of 2-year OS (29% vs 12.5%, p=0.07). With or without induction chemotherapy, early-death rate (<8 weeks) was 12.5% and 37.3%, respectively. Thus, induction remained the best treatment for physically-fit elderly patients. Using azacitidine at any time of the treatment was a predictive factor of longer survival (1-year OS: 67.8% vs 36.9%, p=0.004). Otherwise, no impact was found on 2-year OS (25.6% vs 25.9%, NS). We tried to define a prognostic score to select elderly patients likely to benefit from induction chemotherapy. In univariate analysis, the significant prognostic factors of OS in the elderly population treated with induction chemotherapy was: age\u00b3 75, unfavorable karyotype, creatinine clearance using the MDRD equation< 60ml/min/1.73m2, Modified Charlson Score \u00b32 and PS\u00b32. In a multivariate analysis, only Charlson score and PS remained significant in terms of OS. Patients with Charlson Score \u00b21 and PS \u00b21 (0 unfavorable factor, n=60) or Charlson Score \u00b32 or PS \u00b32 (1 unfavorable factor, n=69) were considered to be at low risk (fit) for induction chemotherapy whereas patients with Charlson Score \u00b32 and PS\u00b32 (2 unfavorable factors, 29 pts) were considered to be at high risk (frail). In the entire cohort (n=158 pts, data missing for 5 pts), Fit patients and Frail patients had an early-death rate of 10.8% vs 30.8% (p=0.048), a CR rate of 40.3% vs 3.8% (p<0.001), six-month OS 69.7% vs 39%, 1-year OS 53.7% vs 0% and 2-year OS 28.8% vs 0% (p<0.001), respectively. No survivors were observed in the frail group after one year of follow-up. Sub-group analysis found the same results for patients initially treated with induction chemotherapy or palliative treatment. Conclusion: We present a prognostic model composed of two easy-to-operate parameters that stratify patients into Fit or Frail groups. Patients with a Modified Charlson Score \u00b32 and a PS \u00b32 did not benefit from induction chemotherapy and had a high risk of death. In such cases, treatment should be azacitidine or palliative treatment. External validation is needed.
