    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2404 Fap1 (Fas-associated phosphatase 1) interacts with the C-terminus of multiple proteins via a PDZ-type protein-protein interaction domain. Interaction of Fap1 with Fas results in Fas-de-phosphorylation and inhibits Fas-induced apoptosis. In previous studies, we determined that PTPN13 , the gene encoding Fap1, is a target gene for the interferon consensus sequence binding protein (referred to as Icsbp or Irf8). Icsbp functions as a leukemia suppressor in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and we previously demonstrated Icsbp/Fap1-dependent apoptosis resistance in cells expressing the CML-associated oncoprotein, Bcr-abl. Another known interaction partner for Fap1 is the adenomatous polyposis coli protein (Apc). However, the functional significance of this interaction has not been previously explored. In the current stuides, we investigate whether interaction between Fap1 and Apc impacts the pathogenesis of CML. Apc is involved in assembly of a multi-protein complex that includes Apc, Axin, Gsk3-beta and beta-catenin. Association of these proteins results in serine/threonine phosphorylation (pS/T) of beta-catenin by Gsk3-beta. pS/T beta-catenin is released from the complex and degraded by the proteasome. Previous studies demonstrated that pS/T of beta-catenin, and consequent beta-catenin degradation, is impaired in CML, but the mechanism for this impairment is unknown in most cases. We find that Icsbp-dependent increase in Fap1 results in increased interaction between Fap1 and Apc in Bcr-abl+ myeloid progenitor cells. We also find that increased Fap1/Apc interaction is associated with inactivation (de-phosphorylation) of Gsk3-beta and a decrease in inhibitory pS/T of \u03b2catenin. We find that this results in increased beta-catenin protein and activity. We also find that Fap1 co-immuno-precipitates with Apc, Axin, Gsk3-beta and beta-catenin. This result suggests the possibility that Gsk3-beta is a substrate for Fap1 protein tyrosine phosphatase activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that Fap1 is able to dephosphorylate Gsk3-beta in vitro . We tested the functional significance of this observation in experiments using an activated form of Gsk3-beta that cannot be dephosphorylated at a key residue (Y216D-Gsk3-beta). We find that expression of this Gsk3-beta mutant partly reverses the effect of Bcr-abl and Fap1 on beta-catenin protein stability and activity. Increased beta-catenin activity is a characteristic of leukemia stem cells (LSC) in CML, and increasing beta-catenin activity in the bone marrow is associated with poor prognosis in CML. Therefore, these studies identify a novel pathway that regulates events significant to CML pathogenesis. These studies also identify a role for Apc in the pathogenesis of leukemia, and another mechanism for the leukemia suppressor effect of Icsbp.
