    "abstract_text": "Abstract 182 Protective immunity against infection requires sustained antibody production by long-lived plasma cells (LLPC) that survive for years/decades within specialized niches. What regulates/supports this survival remains largely unknown. However, it has been shown that normal and transformed (human multiple myeloma) LLPC are critically dependent on the bone marrow microenvironment, including cell-to-cell interactions. This lead us to hypothesize that modulating these interactions could either enhance antibody production for vaccine development or, conversely, compromise the survival of transformed/normal LLPC in the bone marrow microenvironment. We have shown that the T cell costimulatory receptor CD28 expressed on both normal and transformed LLPC, plays an essential role in survival. While LLPC and short-lived plasma cells (SLPC) both express CD28, its activation in vitro only significantly increases survival and IgG production in LLPC. Consistent with these findings, we show in vivo , vaccinated bone marrow CD28 \u2212/\u2212 :\u03bcMT chimeras had significantly reduced long-term antibody titers and decreased LLPC (but not SLPC) t 1/2 from 426 to 63 days. These findings demonstrate the existence of a distinct bone marrow (BM) LLPC subset necessary to sustain antibody titers, and establish a central role for CD28 function in the maintenance of plasma cells and humoral immunity. While CD28 signaling has been shown to play an important role in maintaining long-term humoral immune responses, the mechanism by which CD28 signaling affects PC function has not yet been determined. To further elucidate CD28 signaling in BM PC, we utilized CD28 conditional knock-in mice. In these mice, the CD28 cytoplasmic tail is mutated at either the YMNM or proline-rich motifs, resulting in an inhibition of PI3K or vav signaling, respectively. We found that CD28-vav signaling deficient BM PC were selectively depleted in vivo and could not be rescued by CD28 activation in in vitro serum starvation conditions. Furthermore, anti-CD28 mAb drove a 1.5 fold increase in Blimp-1 expression in BM PC, compared to control. This increase was regulated through the CD28-vav signaling pathway, as CD28 activation in CD28-vav signaling deficient BM PC did not increase Blimp-1 expression. To further determine if CD28 is acting directly on the Blimp-1 promoter, we examined in silico for a CD28RE composite element, previously reported to transcriptionally regulate IL-2 production in T cells and IL-8 production in myeloma cells. To our surprise, we found a CD28RE \u201clike\u201d site 4712bp upstream of the Blimp-1 start site. To confirm CD28 transcriptionally regulates Blimp-1 promoter activity, we transfected the CD28 + plasmacytoma cell line J558 with full-length or truncated Blimp-1 promoter constructs (i.e. 7000bp, 4500bp, 1500bp). We found CD28 activation enhances Blimp-1 activity in J558 cells transfected with full-length-Blimp-1, and this activity was lost when the promoter was truncated. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we confirmed the CD28RE is required for induction of Blimp-1 in PC. Furthermore, we show CD28 activation of Blimp-1 increases the BCMA receptor in BM PC. Taken together, our data suggests the CD28-vav signaling pathway in PC induces a CD28RE composite element, which is necessary for the induction of the key PC transcriptional regulator Blimp-1, required to maintain LLPC and humoral immunity.
