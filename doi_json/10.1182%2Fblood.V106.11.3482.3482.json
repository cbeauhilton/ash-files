    "abstract_text": "Introduction. Acute renal failure (ARF) develops in 10\u201315% of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Typically, complexes of serum free light chains (sFLC) and Tamm-Horsfall protein form casts in the distal tubules that block urine flow. Many patients, subsequently, require long-term hemodialysis (HD) and may have reduced survival. In an attempt to minimise renal damage, plasma exchange (PE) has been used to reduce the pre-renal load of sFLC. Zucchelli et al., ( Kidney Int  1988 ; 33 : 1175 \u20131180 ) showed that PE reduced HD requirements but subsequent controlled trials showed no benefit ( Johnson WJ et al., Arch Intern Med  1990 ; 150 : 863 \u2013869 : Clarke WF et al., Haematologica  2005 ; 90 (s1) p 117 ). The availability of sFLC immunoassays now allows an informed evaluation of the role of PE and/or HD in treating these patients. Methods. sFLC were measured in 1: 100 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), GFR< 15ml/min and not on dialysis; 2: 38 at the beginning and end of HD (dialyzer A) and 3: 25 on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). sFLC hemofiltration efficiency was assessed, in-vitro, for three different dialyzers, using standard pump pressures and flow rates. Sera containing approximately 1,000 mg/L of monoclonal kappa (\u03ba ) (NR < 20mg/L) and lambda (\u03bb ) FLC (NR < 27mg/L) were recycled for ~45 minutes through the dialyzers and clearance rates assessed. A two-compartment, mathematical model was constructed to assess sFLC removal by HD and PE from hypothetical patients. The following parameters were considered:- sFLC concentrations in MM at clinical presentation; monomeric \u03ba or dimeric \u03bb clearance differences; partition of sFLC between vascular and extravascular compartments; flow of FLC between compartments; half-life of sFLC in ARF; sFLC production and tumour killing rates with chemotherapy. The model was interrogated for various dialysis times, different dialyzers and a PE protocol of 3L, x6 over 2 weeks. Results. Mean sFLC concentrations in severe CRF were: \u03ba 93 mg/L (range 43\u2013207); \u03bb 64 mg/L (range 43\u2013134). Mean sFLC before and after HD: \u03ba 130 mg/L (range 40\u2013567) to 49 (range 20\u2013234); \u03bb 100 mg/L (range 31\u2013225) to 61 (range 24\u2013159). Mean sFLC in CAPD patients: \u03ba 118 mg/L (range 31\u2013266); \u03bb 114 mg/L (range 36\u2013263). Clearances of sFLC by the 3 dialyzers were: A: BBraun high flux polyethersulfone 1.8sqm (HI PeS) (the dialyzer in routine use); \u03ba 46%: \u03bb 39%, B: Idmesa high flux polyethersulphone 2.0sqm (200MHP); \u03ba 67%: \u03bb 59%, C: Asahi high flux polysulphone 2.1sqm (APS 1050); \u03ba 71%: \u03bb 65%. Model calculations showed that sFLC reduced from a starting value of 14g/L (typical of light chain MM) to less than 0.5g/L in 14 days using PE. Membrane A, used for four hours, x3/week, was approximately 20% more efficient than PE and reduced \u03ba sFLC approximately 50% faster than the natural clearance rate of patients in ARF. Dialyzers B and C were approximately twice as efficient. Performing initial, 16-hour dialyses daily for 3 days, with dialyzer C reduced sFLC to less than 0.5g/L in 2\u20133 days with ~95% of the sFLC being removed. Dimeric \u03bb sFLC were removed ~50% more slowly. Conclusion. PE was less efficient at removing sFLC than routine HD. Prolonged HD with high-flux dialyzers removed monoclonal sFLC quickly and should be assessed in a clinical trial for patients with acute myeloma kidney. CAPD was inefficient at removing sFLC.",
