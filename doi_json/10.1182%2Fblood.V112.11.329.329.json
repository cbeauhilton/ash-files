    "abstract_text": "The multicenter CLL2H trial of the GCLLSG evaluated subcutaneous alemtuzumab 3 \u00d7 30 mg weekly in fludarabine refractory CLL. From September 2002 to February 2006, 103 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of alemtuzumab. Median age was 63 (35.1\u201381.8) years, 72% were male, 74% were Binet C, and a median of 3 (1\u201310) prior lines had been given. Unfavorable genetics were frequent (17p deletion: 29%, 11q deletion: 19%, unmutated IgV H : 68%, TP53 mutation 34%). Subcutaneous treatment was performed on an outpatient basis in 96% and had to be temporarily interrupted in 65 patients due to neutropenia (27%), anemia (3%), thrombocytopenia (8%), infections (36%), and was stopped early in 65 cases due to insufficient response (43%), hematotoxicity (14%) and infections (29%). The median alemtuzumab dose given was 722 (3\u20132203) mg. Toxicity during treatment period was mostly grade I/II apart from hematotoxicity. Grade 3/4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia occurred in 56%, 57%, and 50% of patients, respectively. Grade 3/4 non-cytomegalovirus infection occurred in 29%. CMV reactivation was observed in 15 % total, Grade 3/4 occurred in 8% of patients. All CMV episodes were successfully treated with anti-CMV therapy, and there was no CMV-related death. Injection site reaction occurred in 34% and was grade 1 or 2 except in 1 patient who had grade 3 reaction. Pegfilgrastim prophylaxis was scheduled for the second half of the trial. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 70% vs 46% and non-CMV infections occurred in 32% vs 24% in the first and second half, respectively. Development of anti-alemtuzumab antibody was assessed in samples from 21 patients. Plasma anti-alemtuzumab antibody was detectable in only 1 patient, who had a concentration marginally above the detection threshold and was found to be negative in a re-test 5 months later. Stable disease was achieved in this patient. After a median follow-up time of 37.9 months, there were 75 (73%) deaths, 56% due to disease progression, 31% due to infection, and 13% not related to CLL. Overall response rate was 34% (CR 4%, PR 30%), median progression free survival time was 7.7 months, and median overall survival time was 19.1 months. Clinical and biologic parameters (age, sex, B-symptoms, stage, ECOG, number of prior lines, node size, hepato-spenomegaly, WBC, LDH, \u03b22-MG, TK, VH status, genomic aberrations and TP53 mutation) were evaluated for their prognostic role. In univariate analyses, OS was significantly inferior for age > 65 y (12.2 vs 29.0 mo, p 1 (10.8 vs 21.5 mo, p=.011), TK > median (26U/L) (14.9 vs 29.0 mo, p=.001), and \u03b22- MG > 5 (13.6 vs 27.2 mo, p=.004). Median PFS and OS were not different for 17p-, 11q-, other cytogenetic and TP53 mutation subgroups. Multivariate analysis by Cox regression revealed only age (HR 1.6, p<.001) as significant prognostic factor, while TK (p=.11), \u03b22- MG (p=.089), and 17p- (p=.528) showed no significant impact. The choice of next therapy significantly affected survival. Seventy-four patients received subsequent salvage treatment or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The median OS since next therapy in these patients was 11.5 months. The 2-year OS rate for allogeneic SCT as compared to other subsequent treatments (chemo-, immuno-, or chemoimmunotherapies) was 86% and 27% (p=0.009)."
