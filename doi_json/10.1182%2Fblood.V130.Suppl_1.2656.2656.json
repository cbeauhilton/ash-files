    "abstract_text": "T-cell recruiting antibody constructs represent a promising approach to recruit T-cells to tumor cells independent of TCR-specificity. So far, CD33 has been the most commonly targeted antigen in AML. However, its ubiquitous expression pattern within the healthy myeloid hematopoietic system remains a major challenge. To reduce on-target off-leukemia toxicity, alternative AML-associated targets with a more restricted expression pattern are sought after. We evaluated CD135 ( FLT3 ; FSM-like tyrosine kinase 3) as a target antigen for T-cell recruiting antibody based immunotherapy in AML. In 159/192 of AML patient samples (83%; MFI ratio of >1.5) a significant expression level was detected by flow cytometry with no differences in expression level at time of initial diagnosis versus relapse (Initial diagnosis: n=161, median MFI ratio 3.0 vs relapse: n=18, median MFI ratio 3.5). Expression level could neither be correlated to FLT3 mutational status (median MFI ratio FLT3-ITD vs FLT3 wild type (WT): 3.7 vs 4.0, n=52 and 173 respectively) nor to FLT3 allelic ratio (median MFI ratio allelic ratio high vs low: 4.1 vs 4.5, n=13 and 19 respectively). Importantly, CD34 + /CD38 - leukemia initiating cells (LICs) also expressed CD135 at a similar level compared to AML bulk cells (Median MFI ratio LIC: 2.4 vs bulk: 2.6, p=0.1, n=81). Bone marrow progenitor cells (CD45 DIM /SSC LOW ) cells and CD34 + /CD38 - expressing hematopoietic precursors from healthy bone marrow expressed CD135 to a significantly lower level compared to AML bulk cells and LICs, respectively (median MFI Ratio: AML bulk vs healthy progenitor cells: 3.2 vs 2.1, p<0.0001; LICs vs HSCs: 3.1 vs 0.7, p=0.0003). Next, we evaluated a CD135xCD3 BiTE\u00ae antibody construct ( FLT3 BiTE\u00ae) for its ability to mediate cytotoxicity against AML cell lines and primary AML cells. Target antigen expression level was relevant for FLT3 BiTE\u00ae mediated cytotoxicity as demonstrated by preferential lysis of CD135 bright (MM6, MFI ratio 15) vs CD135 dim (OCI-AML3, MFI ratio 1.5) AML cell lines. Cytotoxicity against primary AML cells was tested in our long-term culture system using either allogeneic or autologous T cells (Krupka et al, Blood 2014). In the allogeneic set-up, with a fixed E:T ratio of 1:5, the FLT3 BiTE\u00ae antibody construct mediated efficient elimination of primary AML cells within 9 days of culture (median % specific lysis 75.9, n=6). This was accompanied by a strong T-cell proliferation (fold change CD2 + T cells: 7.9, n=6). In the autologous system, the E:T ratio was not fixed and influenced by the number of residual T-cells in the respective AML sample. Despite low E:T ratios (1:12-1:74) the FLT3 BiTE\u00ae induced high cytotoxicity and T-cell proliferation against primary AML cells within 14 days of culture (median specific lysis: 34.4%; fold change CD2 T cells: 6.6, n=7). We further investigated the influence of Midostaurin on FLT3 BiTE\u00ae mediated cytotoxicity against AML cells. Midostaurin (1 \u00b5M) drastically decreased FLT3 BiTE\u00ae mediated cytotoxicity in 7/8 patient samples (median % cytotoxicity FLT3 BiTE\u00ae vs +Midostaurin: 59.0 vs 39.9, p=0.02). This corresponded to a significant decrease in BiTE\u00ae- as well as CD3/CD28-mediated T-cell proliferation (median % CD3/CD28 mediated T-cell proliferation FLT3 BiTE\u00ae vs +Midostaurin: 56.4 vs 1.46, n=5). It has been reported that Midostaurin inhibits Akt phosphorylation (Kawai, J Bio Sci 2015), a major factor in T-cell proliferation, which might explain the decrease in T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. In summary, CD135 was shown to be expressed in the majority of AML patients on AML bulk cells as well as LICs with a restricted expression pattern in the healthy hematopoietic compartment. The FLT3 BiTE\u00ae antibody construct mediated strong cytotoxicity against primary AML cells. This correlated to profound T-cell activation and proliferation. The combinatorial approach with Midostaurin abrogated BiTE\u00ae mediated cytotoxicity due to a decrease in T-cell proliferation. As T-cell recruiting antibody construct mediated cytotoxicity relies on T-cell function, our data do not support the combinatorial approach with the FLT3 -TKI Midostaurin for targeted therapy of AML.
