    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1269 Introduction. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired hematopoietic disorder characterized by the clonal expansion of a PIG-A mutated stem cell and consequent defective synthesis of glycosil phosphatidyl-inositol-anchored proteins, complement-mediated hemolysis, increased incidence of thrombosis, bone marrow failure. PNH and acquired aplastic anemia (AA) are closely related and a reciprocal progression is possible. A relative resistance of the PNH stem cell to the immune-mediated damage can explain the PNH clonal expansion in AA. High resolution flow cytometry analysis (FCA) has revealed a high incidence of minor PNH clones in adult AA patients at diagnosis, predictive for some Authors of a favourable response to the immunosuppressive therapy (IST) (Maciejevki et al, 2001; Ishiyama et al, 2003; Sugimori et al, 2006). \u201cPure\u201d PNH is a very rare disease in children. Only a few studies have so far evaluated longitudinally PNH clones in pediatric AA patients. Materials and Methods. Ninety AA patients diagnosed in 8 AIEOP (Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology) Centers (age at diagnosis 1\u201320 years, median =10.8, 51 severe AA, 30 very severe AA, 9 non severe AA) were studied: forty-one since diagnosis, 25 during IST, 20 off therapy and 4 selected cases after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Among the patients followed since diagnosis, 8 received an HLA matched sibling donor HSCT as first line therapy, whereas the other 33 patients were treated with IST according to EBMT protocols (anti-lymphocyte globulin/anti-thymocyte, ciclosporin \u00b1 granulocyte colony stimulating factor). The study started in 1998. Peripheral blood PNH cells were detected by lack of CD59 expression on granulocytes by a two-color FCA for CD59 (clone p282-FITC Becton-Dickinson) and CD11b (clone D12-PE Becton-Dickinson); at least 10 5 cells were analyzed, for a total of 1104 tests. The presence of a population CD11b+/CD59- > 0.15% was defined as abnormal; the cut off value was established in 1998 by evaluating 87 normal controls (PNH clones: median = 0.001%, mean+2SD=0.10%). Since 2009 FCA results were confirmed by more sensitive techniques with three or six-color sequential gating analysis for CD45/33/66b or CD45/33/15/24/14/FLAER. Results. A PNH+ clone was observed in 15 patients (36.6%) at diagnosis (clone size 0.17\u201310.4%), in 10 patients (40%) during IST (clone size 0.16\u201312.6%) and in 8 patients (40%) off-therapy (clone size 0.16\u20134.0%). The presence of a PNH+ clone at diagnosis did not predict a favourable response to IST, both in ALG and ATG-treated patients. In 33 patients (16 at diagnosis, 9 in IST, 8 off therapy), the presence of the PNH clone was sporadic or intermittent, whereas in 13 patients (9 at diagnosis, 3 in IST, 1 off therapy) the clone persisted for more than 3 following controls (follow up 6\u201360 months). Among the 26 PNH- patients at diagnosis, in 10 a PNH clone (clone size 0.16\u20131.7%) appeared later during IST. Among the 25 patients studied during IST, in one patient PNH clone appearance was associated with the tapering of cyclosporine ( figure 1 ), in two with the relapse when off therapy. In one out of 4 patients treated with HSCT, a PNH clone appeared at time of relapse and disappeared after starting IST with cyclosporine ( figure 2 ). A mild hemolysis was observed in the only 2 patients with a major PNH clone (clone size 12.6 and 10.4% respectively). No thrombotic events were reported. Conclusions. We have observed a significant incidence of minor PNH clones in pediatric AA at diagnosis, as reported in adults. Whereas previous studies in adults correlated the presence of pre-treatment minor PNH clones with a favourable response to IST, we do not confirm those observations both in the present multi-centre as in our previous single-centre study (Timeus et al, 2010), in agreement with Yoshida et al (2008) and Scheinberg et al (2010). The appearance of a PNH clone in a PNH- patient at diagnosis is described as uncommon (Sugimori et al, 2009), however in our series this was observed in 38% of previously PNH- patients. In AA the presence of PNH clones seems related to complex interactions between stem cells, immune-mediated damage and immunosuppressive therapy. A periodic screening for PNH clones in patients with AA is recommended, permitting modulation in IST, early identification of major PNH clones and prompt diagnosis of a frank PNH.
