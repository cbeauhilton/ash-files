    "abstract_text": "Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) is an essential regulator of cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis, depending on the cellular context. TGF-\u03b21 is also known to affect cell-to-cell interactions between tumor and stromal cells through production of the extracellular matrix and stimulation of integrin receptors. We investigated the role of TGF-\u03b21 in the survival of human leukemic cells growing in the context of bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, and the anti-leukemia effects of the novel TGF-\u03b2 receptor inhibitor LY2109761. BM-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) produced TGF-\u03b2 in an autocrine fashion. Treatment with rhTGF-\u03b21 (2ng/mL) inhibited the spontaneous and Ara-C-induced apoptosis in U937 cells (% AnnexinV(+), control 34.5\u00b18.4; TGF-\u03b21 18.4\u00b14.5; Ara-C 88.6\u00b13.0; Ara-C/TGF-\u03b21 60.4\u00b18.0, p=0.04). These effects were more prominent in U937 cells co-cultured with MSC (% AnnexinV(+), control 19.4\u00b12.8; TGF-\u03b21 3.5\u00b11.0; Ara-C 69.0\u00b13.6; Ara-C+TGF-\u03b21 24.9\u00b13.3; p=0.01). In U937 cells co-cultured with MSC, rhTGF-\u03b21 conferred higher cell protective effects on leukemia cells attached to MSC than on floating cells. Conversely, the pro-survival effects of TGF-\u03b21 were inhibited by 5mM LY2109761 (%AnnexinV(+); MSC(\u2212), control 31.8\u00b12.3, TGF-\u03b21 19.5\u00b13.0, LY 28.4\u00b14.4, TGF-\u03b21+LY 37.7\u00b12.0; MSC(+), control 22.1\u00b11.7, TGF-\u03b21 7.8\u00b10.9, LY16.1\u00b12.6, TGF-\u03b21+ LY 18.0\u00b11.1, p<0.01). Similar results were obtained using TGF-\u03b21 neutralizing antibody. TGF-\u03b21 induced pro-survival phosphorylation of Akt in U937 cells cultured alone or co-cultured with MSC, which was abrogated by LY2109761. Further, rhTGF-\u03b21 induced a moderate increase in C/EBP\u03b2 gene and LAP isoform (cell cycle arrest inducing) of C/EBP\u03b2 protein in U937 cells cultured without MSCs, while markedly upregulating C/EBP\u03b2 gene and protein, both LIP (cell proliferation inducing) and LAP isoforms, under MSCs co-culture condition, suggesting the novel role of C/EBP\u03b2 in TGF-\u03b21-mediated U937 cell survival. In summary, these results indicate that TGF-\u03b21-secreting BM stromal cells promote the survival of U937 leukemia cells via direct cell-to-cell interaction and promote chemoresistance of leukemia cells through the activation of Akt signaling and upregulation of C/EBP\u03b2. The blockade of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by LY2109761, which effectively inhibited the pro-survival signaling, may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy against leukemia cells in the BM microenvironment."
