    "abstract_text": "Background High-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HCT) is considered the standard of care for newly diagnosed, transplant-eligible multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Due to improvements in induction, stem cell mobilization, and dose adjustment of the conditioning regimen, auto-HCT is increasingly used in older MM patients, with several retrospective analyses showing similar clinical outcomes compared to younger patients. Methods To further confirm these results, we performed a single-center retrospective analysis of MM patients undergoing auto-HCT between January 2006 and December 2016. Patients were divided into two groups: older (> 70 years) and younger (\u2264 70 years). Results 1128 patients (182 older, 946 younger) were included in this analysis. Patient characteristics are summarized in the attached Table. More patients (59% vs. 45%, p = 0.01) in the older cohort had ISS stage II or III disease. Older cohort was more likely to receive reduced-dose melphalan (140 mg/m\u00b2) as conditioning regimen (32% vs 3%, p =  70 years, high-risk cytogenetics, serum creatinine level > 2 mg/dl and ISS stage III were associated with worse PFS and OS. In contrast, melphalan 200 mg/m\u00b2 for conditioning and achievement of CR after induction therapy were associated with better PFS and OS. These 6 factors were studied in multivariate analyses using a classification and regression tree (CART) method. In CART analysis for PFS, ISS stage II or III, and high-risk cytogenetics were associated with shorter PFS. Similarly, in CART analysis for OS, older age (> 69 years), ISS stage II or III, and high-risk cytogenetics were associated with a shorter OS. Conclusion In this large single-center analysis, there was no difference in 100-day NRM, CR rates and the risk of progression after auto-HCT between the older and the younger patients. However, older age was associated with a shorter PFS and OS due to increased NRM. On multivariate CART analysis, ISS stage II or III and high-risk cytogenetics were associated with a worse PFS and OS, while age > 69 years was associated with a worse OS only. The impact of comorbidities on NRM is being evaluated in ongoing analyses.
