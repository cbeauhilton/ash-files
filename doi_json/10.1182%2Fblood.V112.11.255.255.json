    "abstract_text": "Structural data of integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 have been interpreted as supporting a model in which: the receptor exists primarily in a \u201cbent,\u201d low affinity conformation on unactivated platelets, and activation induces an extended, high affinity conformation prior to, or following, ligand binding. Previous studies found that \u201cclasping\u201d the \u03b1IIb head domain to the \u03b23 tail decreased fibrinogen binding. To study the role of \u03b1IIb extension about the genu we created and analyzed an energy-optimized model of the complete extracellular domain of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and then introduced a disulfide \u201cclamp\u201d between the \u03b1IIb thigh and calf-1 domains by mutating \u03b1IIb R597 and Y645 to cysteine residues. Increased mobility of the clamped mutant on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing, but not reducing conditions, relative to the WT receptor supported the successful introduction of a new disulfide bond. Clamped \u03b1IIb\u03b23 had markedly reduced ability to bind the large soluble ligands fibrinogen [induced by mAb AP5; net normalized fluorescence intensity (NNFI) of 17 \u00b1 2 for normal \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and 0.4 \u00b1 0.2 for clamped \u03b1IIb\u03b23; n=3; p<0.001] and PAC1 [induced by mAb PT25-2; NNFIs of 17 \u00b1 7 and 2 \u00b1 1, respectively (n=3; p<0.001)]. The defect in fibrinogen and PAC-1 binding could be partially restored (~40\u201350%) by treating the cells with the reducing agent DTT. In contrast, the clamp had little effect on the binding of the Mr 7,500 snake venom kistrin (non-significant ~30% reduction) or \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen (non-significant ~20% reduction). Remarkably, the defect in binding the large soluble ligands was rescued by co-expressing clamped \u03b1IIb with the \u03b23- activating mutation N339S. The clamped \u03b1IIb\u03b23 also displayed a defect in kistrin-induced (200 nM) exposure of the mAb AP5 epitope in the PSI domain of \u03b23 (NNFI 50 \u00b1 11 for normal \u03b1IIb\u03b23 vs. 24 \u00b1 5 for clamped \u03b1IIb\u03b23; p<0.001; n=5), and this abnormality was also reversed by DTT. By analyzing the solvent accessible areas in our model of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 with and without extension, we determined that extension results in a 370 A\u030a2 reduction in buried solvent-accessible area in the PSI domain as a result of losing some of its interactions with the IEGF-2 domain. We hypothesize that clamping \u03b1IIb may, therefore, partially preserve these PSI-IEGF-2 domain interactions. Collectively, our studies support a role for \u03b1IIb extension in the binding of large, but not small ligands, and suggest that \u03b1IIb extension is less important for interactions with immobilized than soluble fibrinogen. Our data are consistent with \u03b1IIb extension resulting in increased access to the ligand binding site and/or destabilizing \u03b23 headpiece-tailpiece interactions and thus facilitating the conformational change(s) that affect the intrinsic affinity of the binding pocket for ligand. They may also provide an explanation for the paradoxical finding that platelet binding of soluble fibrinogen requires exogenous activation, whereas platelet adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen does not."
