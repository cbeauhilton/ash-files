    "abstract_text": "Background: T cell senescence is a physiological process typically associated with aging. In addition, lymphopenia and chronic immune activation can result in T cell senescence. CD57, a member of the N-CAM family initially described as a natural killer cell marker, has been reported as a marker of human senescent CD8 T cells. Percentages of CD57+ CD8 T cells increase during aging as well as during chronic viral infections. Early studies have reported increased proportions of CD57-expressing CD8 T cells after autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Whether these cells can be considered a counterpart of the senescent population found during aging is at present unknown. More importantly, whether the expansion of CD57+ CD8 T cells is associated with impaired immunocompetence after allogeneic HSCT remains to be investigated. Materials and Methods : With written informed consent, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from healthy controls (HC, n=21) and patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT (n=115) at Geneva University Hospitals. Proportions of CD57+ CD8 T cells as well as phenotypic and functional characteristics of CD57+ CD8 T cells were assessed by flow cytometry. Virus-specific CD8 T cells were identified by flow cytometry based on IFNg and/or TNFa intra-cytoplasmic expression after 6h in vitro stimulation with peptides derived from CMV, EBV, HHV6, BKV and Adenovirus. Torque Teno Virus (TTV) replication was quantified by quantitative PCR as previously described ( Pradier et al., Front Immunol 2020; doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.00998 ). Results: CD8 T cells recovered from allogeneic HSCT displayed significantly higher proportions of CD57+ cells compared with healthy controls (HC, median 23% [range 6%-67%]; HSCT 58% [11%-97%]; p= 8.1e\u221206; Figure 1A-B). Such a difference was detected at early time points after transplantation and further increased at later time points (Figure 1B). After taking into account T cell subsets heterogeneity, we observed higher proportions of CD57+ cells in CD45RA- CCR7+ CD27+ central memory (CM; p= 0.00057), CD45RA- CCR7- CD27+ transitional memory (TM; p=1.1e-05) and CD45RA- CCR7- CD27- effector memory (EM; p=2.6e\u221206) CD8 T cells from allogeneic HSCT recipients compared with healthy controls. We did not observe any significant differences in CD57 expression in na\u00efve nor in TEMRA CD8 T cells. Phenotypically, CD57+ CD8 T cells from allogeneic HSCT recipients displayed a senescent immunophenotype characterized by the low surface expression of CD127 that was further downregulated in CD57+ CD8 T cells from allogeneic HSCT recipients compared with healthy controls (p=0.00067). Functionally, CD57+ CD8 T cells from allogeneic HSCT recipients displayed a similar capacity to produce IFN-g, TNF-a, granzyme B and perforin when compared to CD57+ CD8 T cells from healthy controls. Virus-specific CD8 T cells identified upon stimulation with CMV, EBV, HHV6, BKV and Adenovirus peptides mainly displayed a CD27- effector memory phenotype in HSCT recipients (Figure 1C) and expressed higher levels of CD57 in HSCT recipients compared with healthy controls for CMV (p=0.017(; EBV p=0.018; Figure 1C-D). with a trend not reaching significance was for adenovirus, HHV6 and BK-virus-specific CD8 T cells. Using the replication of the non-pathogenic anellovirus TTV as a measure of impaired immunocompetence, we observed that the proportion of CD57-expressing cells among effector memory CD8 T cells positively correlated with TTV titers in allogeneic HSCT recipients (R=0.32, p=0.019; Figure 1E). Conclusion: These results show that the proportion of phenotypically senescent CD57+ CD8 T cells increases after allogeneic HSCT as a result of an increased expression at the surface of memory CD8 T cells, including virus-specific cells. Moreover, CD57 expression at the surface of EM CD8 T cells, a highly enriched population in allogeneic HSCT recipients, correlated with higher replication of TTV, reflecting a status of impaired immunocompetence after allogeneic HSCT. Studies are ongoing to determine the utility of CD57 expression on T cells as a biomarker to predict infectious complications after allogeneic HSCT.
