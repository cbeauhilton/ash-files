    "abstract_text": "Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) treatment has advanced considerably with proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), and, most recently, monoclonal antibodies. However, treatment response is quite heterogeneous, and many patients still progress even with novel combination therapies. Thus, understanding the factors that underlie response to treatment is a priority. Several somatic genomic aberrations and mutations predict poor response to therapy. However, germline variation has not previously been investigated as a predictor of treatment response in MM. We used genome-wide association and transcriptome-wide association approaches to identify germline genetic predictors of treatment response in MM. Methods: We included 510 MM patients from Mayo Clinic and 324 MM patients from UCSF diagnosed from 1999-2015. Basic demographics, laboratory values and pathology at diagnosis, type of initial therapy, duration of therapy, and follow-up were ascertained by chart review. Patients were grouped into categories of treatment based on their first line therapy: proteasome inhibitor-based regimen, IMiD based regimen, combination proteasome and IMiD based regimen, or other. Response was assessed using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria after 4-6 cycles of induction. As such, response was categorized into progressive disease (PD), minimal response (MR), partial response (PR), very good partial response (VGPR), or complete response (CR). Germline samples were genotyped using Illumina or Affymetrix arrays and were imputed based on the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC). For the genome-wide association study (GWAS), we included all SNPs with minor allele frequency >0.01 and imputation r 2 of >0.5. We tested each SNP for association with treatment response using a linear regression model that adjusted for age, gender, and genetic ancestry (from principal components analysis (PCA)). To perform the transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), we calculated predicted gene expression data using PREDIXCAN software on a reference cohort of 922 individuals with genotype and RNA expression data from peripheral blood. We then tested the association between predicted gene expression and response to therapy using linear regression models. Both the GWAS and TWAS were performed on subgroups of patients who received either proteasome inhibitors or IMiD therapies. The analyses of patients on proteasome inhibitors were adjusted for IMiD use as a covariate and analyses of patients on IMiDs were adjusted for proteasome inhibitor use. The threshold for genome-wide significance loci was set at P = 5 x 10 -8 and the threshold for suggestive loci was set at P = 10 -6 . The threshold for significance for TWAS was set at P = 4 x 10 -6 by using a Bonferroni correction for the number of genes for which genetic models of expression could be developed by PREDIXCAN. Results: Overall, 42.7% (59 of 138) of patients on proteasome inhibitors alone, 32.5% (66 of 203) of patients on IMiDs alone, and 58.1% (50 of 86) of patients on combination achieved at least a VGPR. There were no significant differences in response across centers in analyses that adjusted for age, sex and types of therapy. There were no genome wide significant loci to predict for response. We identified 8 suggestive SNPs associated with proteasome inhibitor response and 4 suggestive SNPs associated with IMiD response. TWAS identified ZNF622 as a candidate genetic modifier of proteasome inhibitor effect that was significant after correction for multiple hypothesis testing (P = 1.6 x 10 -6 ). Higher genetically predicted expression was associated with improved response to proteasome inhibitor therapy. Among patients above the median of predicted expression of ZNF622 on proteasome inhibitors, 62.6% achieved at least VGPR; among patients at or below the median of expression, only 37.6% achieved at least VGPR. Conclusions: We identified an association between predicted expression of ZNF622 and clinical response to proteasome inhibitor therapy among MM patients. ZNF622 is a zinc finger binding protein which is known to be co-activator of B Myb activity and to affect apoptosis in response to oxidative stress. Our work highlights the potential importance of pharmacogenetic modifiers of treatment response in MM.
