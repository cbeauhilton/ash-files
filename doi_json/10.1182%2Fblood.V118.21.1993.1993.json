    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1993 Wilm's tumor protein-1 (WT1) is over-expressed in a number of solid and hematologic malignancies including multiple myeloma (MM). The emergence of WT1-specific T cells has been shown to correlate with better relapse-free survival after allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients (pts) with hematologic malignancies, such as leukemia. In MM, the expression of WT1 in the bone marrow has been shown to correlate with numerous negative prognostic factors, including disease stage and M protein ratio. Taken together, these findings suggest that immunotherapeutic augmentation of WT1-specific immune responses, such as adoptive transfer of WT1-specific T cells, may be capable of eradicating minimal residual disease and preventing relapse in MM. Thus, we examined the significance of WT1-specific cellular immune responses in pts with relapsed MM and high-risk cytogenetics who are undergoing allogeneic T cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (TCD HSCT). In this study, pts were eligible to receive low doses of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI, 5\u00d710 5 -1\u00d710 6 CD3 + /kg) no earlier than 5 months post TCD HSCT. WT1-specific T-cell frequencies were measured in freshly isolated peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens. Frequencies were detected by staining for intracellular IFN-\u03b3 production in response to WT1 peptides, and/or by tetramer analysis, where available. Of 17 pts evaluated, all pts exhibited low frequencies of WT1-specific T-cell responses pre TCD HSCT. Ten of these pts received DLI post TCD HSCT. All 10 pts developed WT1-specific T cell responses post DLI. These increments in WT1-specific T-cell frequencies were associated with reduction in circulating myeloma proteins in all pts. Long-term evaluation demonstrated fluctuations in persisting WT1-specific T-cell frequencies following DLI. In one representative patient, a peak of 3.5% (72/ml) WT1-specific CD8 + T cells were detected in the peripheral blood by staining with the tetramer HLA-A*0201 RMF. This peak T-cell response occurred post TCD HSCT and DLI, and coincided with disease regression. This patient has remained in complete remission for more than 3 years post transplant, with fluctuating levels of WT1-specific CD8 + T cells ranging from 0.3\u20131.5% still persisting. Findings from concurrent molecular chimerism studies conducted on isolated T cells post TCD HSCT suggest that the WT1-specific T cells are of donor origin. Immunohistochemical analyses of WT1 and CD138 staining in MM bone marrow specimens demonstrated consistent co-expression within malignant plasma cells. WT1 expression in the bone marrow of all 6 pts tested correlated with the extent of malignant plasma cell infiltration. In contrast, no WT1 expression was observed when disease was low or absent. Taken together, our findings suggest a correlation between the emergence of WT1-specific T cells post DLI, and disease regression in pts being treated for relapsed MM. The present data support the development of adoptive immunotherapeutic approaches utilizing WT1-specific T cells for pts with MM. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
