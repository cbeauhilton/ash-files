    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-33 MicroRNAs regulate the response of the cell to environmental changes and developmental cues. microRNA expression is dysregulated in cancer \u2013 microRNA expression is generally reduced in cancer cells compared to normal tissue and individual microRNAs, termed oncomirs, that act as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes are frequently aberrantly expressed in cancer and their expression can be linked to prognosis and response to therapy. Because microRNAs regulate cancer cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and metastasis, manipulating microRNA function, either by mimicking or inhibiting miRNAs implicated in cancer, could provide a powerful therapeutic strategy to interfere with key pathways for cancer progression. This talk will explore some of the opportunities and obstacles to harnessing microRNA biology for cancer therapy. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
