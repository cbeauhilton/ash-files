    "abstract_text": "Aim Composite follicular lymphoma with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (FL/DLBCL) is an uncommon hematological neoplasm. The aim of this study was to examine clinico-pathological features of patients with FL/DLBCL and investigate relevant predictors of survival outcome. Methodology Patients with histologically-proven FL/DLBCL at diagnosis (n=106) and who were subsequently treated with Rituximab-based chemotherapy from 2002-2017 at the National Cancer Centre Singapore were retrospectively analyzed. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox proportional models. Results The cohort consisted of 72 men and 34 women with a median age of 59 years (range, 24-82). The cell of origin by Han's algorithm was GCB in 37.7%, ABC in 58.5% and unknown in 3.8%. Eight patients (7.5%) were double-hit for c-MYC, BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements. In a multivariate model inclusive of known clinico-pathological parameters at diagnosis, presence of B symptoms ( p = 0.0122), stage 3 or 4 lymphoma ( p = 0.0166) and double-hit genotype ( p = 0.0045) were independently prognostic for worse overall survival (OS). These factors, excluding B symptoms, were similarly prognostic for progression-free survival (PFS). Including first-line treatment data in the multivariate model, lack of complete response ( p < 0.0001) and use of chemotherapy regimens other than R-CHOP ( p = 0.0360) alongside presence of B symptoms ( p = 0.0022), were the only remaining independent prognostic variables for worse OS. Classification by cell of origin was not prognostic. A Clinico-Genotypic Index derived from point-wise addition of all five adverse parameters (score of 0, 1, 2, 3-4) revealed four prognostic risk groups accounting for 25%, 30%, 25% and 20% of the cohort, with a predicted 5-year OS of 100%, 95%, 57% and 19% respectively ( p < 0.0001). Conclusion A Clinico-Genotypic Index derived from clinical and molecular factors can classify patients with composite FL/DLBCL into distinct prognostic groups. Han's algorithm has no prognostic value in this disease entity. Figure. View large Download slide Figure. View large Download slide  Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
