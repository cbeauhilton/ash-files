    "abstract_text": "Novel immunotherapeutic strategies like BiTE \u00ae (bispecific T cell engager) constructs aim to eradicate neoplastic cells by TCR-independent T-cell activation, and therefore rely on the function of autologous T cells. Currently, their efficacy is also evaluated in heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Previous data demonstrated dysfunction in CD8 + T cells of AML patients (Knaus et al 2018). Thus, we aimed to characterize the progressive modulation of T-cell activity over the course of AML progression to improve the optimal application of T-cell based immunotherapeutic approaches. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from AML patients at time of initial diagnosis (ID), complete remission (CR), relapse (RL), as well as of age-matched healthy donors (HD) were analyzed for T-cell subset distribution and expression of exhaustion markers by flow cytometry. Additionally, T-cell function was assessed after stimulation with 1) CD3/CD28 beads; 2) AMG 330, a CD33/CD3 specific BiTE \u00ae construct, after incubation with OCI-AML3 target cells; or 3) AMG 330 in an autologous ex vivo long-term culture system after incubation with primary AML cells (pAML). After 6 days, T cell proliferation, expression of effector molecules and cytokines, and AMG 330-mediated T-cell cytotoxicity were assessed by flow cytometry. Lastly, we performed longitudinal bulk RNA-sequencing on 5000 sorted T cells from 7 matched ID-RL primary AML samples. Immunophenotypic analysis of BM T-cell subsets revealed a shift from T NAIVE toward central/effector memory subsets during AML progression. We observed lower percentages of T NAIVE in RL (n=3) compared to CR (n=3) CD8 + T cells(11.8 vs. 45.2%, p=0.07; RL vs. CR). Conversely, RL patients showed increased percentages of CD8 + memory T cells (T CM : 23.4 vs. 6.7%; T EM : 29.4 vs. 20.2%; T EMRA : 35.3 vs. 27.8%; RL vs. CR). Further characterization of exhaustion markers exhibited a significantly higher percentage of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells expressing 2B4 (CD244) in ID (n=19) and RL (n=13) compared to HD (n=10, both p < 0.001). A higher percentage of PD-1 + CD8 + and TIM-3 + CD4 + T cells was detected in both ID and RL relative to HD (all p < 0.05). However, a significantly increased percentage of CD8 + T cells expressing TIM-3 and CD160 was detected in ID relative to HD (p < 0.05). Intriguingly, RL CD4 + T cells demonstrated a significantly higher level of LAG3 compared to ID (p < 0.01). In line with phenotypic exhaustion features, ID (n=4) and RL (n=5) CD8 + T cells showed reduced proliferation compared to HD (n=4) CD8 + T cells after CD3/CD28 bead stimulation (both p < 0.01). Correspondingly, we observed a marked reduction in the expression of Granzyme B (GZMB) by CD8 + T cells (both p < 0.05). Interestingly, when compared to ID, RL CD4 + T cells showed decreased TNF-\u03b1 secretion (p < 0.05). In contrast to these findings, AMG 330-mediated T cell cytotoxicity against OCI-AML3 target cells was superior with RL T cells compared to ID T cells (p < 0.001). The percentage of GZMB + CD8 + T cells strikingly enhanced in RL relative to ID (p < 0.01). In an autologous setting with pAML samples, T cells from RL patients (n=6) showed higher AMG 330-mediated cytotoxicity compared to ID (n=9) T cells (67.7 vs. 35.2; RL vs. ID). In our longitudinal RNA-sequencing, differentially expressed genes analysis detected 61 up- and 30 downregulated genes (log2 FC > 1 or < -1; p < 0.01) in RL T cells compared to their matched ID counterparts. Among the significantly upregulated genes in RL, we identified genes associated with memory T cell function ( TP53INP2 , DUSP4 ) and exhaustion ( NR4A1 , TOX2 ). Moreover, Gene set enrichment analysis showed significant enrichment of gene signatures associated to memory and exhausted T cells (normalized enrichment score (NES)=1.2 and 1.3; p-value= 0.026 and 0.008, respectively), depletion of oxidative phosphorylation (NES=-2.05; p adj < 0.0001) and protein secretion (NES=-1.49; p adj < 0.05) gene signatures in RL vs. ID T cells. Taken together, our data show that patient T cells acquire an activated/exhausted phenotype upon AML progression. However, this is not reflected in the T-cell effector functions upon AMG 330 stimulation, in contrast to bead stimulation. These observations may highlight the significant role of the AML target cells in shaping a T-cell response. To this end, we will further analyze the longitudinal communication between T cells and their corresponding AML blasts. Disclosures Brauchle:  Adivo: Current Employment.
