    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2805 CHOP \u2013 based chemotherapy for aggressive lymphomas in patients with age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of 2\u20133 resulted in a historical 3-year progression free survival of approximately 30% in a previous Nordic phase III study. The aim of the present study is to determine whether an intensified regimen with chemoimmunotherapy and CNS prophylaxis improves outcome. Methods: From October 2004 to June 2008 patients were included in a phase II study. Inclusion criteria : 1) Age 18\u201365 years. 2) Newly diagnosed de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL) grade III. 3) No clinical sign of CNS disease and negative CSF cytology/flow cytometry by lumbar puncture. 4) No HIV infection. 5) WHO performance score 0\u20133. 6) Adequate organ functions. Schedule: Six courses of R-CHOEP14. Pegfilgrastim 6 mg sc. day four of each cycle. One course of high dose cytarabine 12 g/m 2 (6 g/m 2 for patients 60\u201365 years). One course of high dose methtrexate 3 g/m 2 (1 g/m 2 for patients 60\u201365 years). Biopsy and/or 18 FDG PET/CT imaging of residual masses after fulfilled therapy was recommended, but not mandatory. Radiotherapy was given to residual masses of uncertain significance. Results. Demographic data:. 156 eligible patients were included (97 males). Median age: 54 years (range 20\u201364). Histology: DLBCL: 145, FL grade 3: 12 (three patients no data). Age adjusted IPI score: 2: 117; 3: 39. Stage III-IV: 150 patients. LDH elevated: 151 patients. Performance status 2\u20133: 51 patients. B-symptoms were registered in 97 patients, more than one extranodal site in 42 and bulky lesions (\u2265 10 cm) in 68. Median observation time for patients alive at last follow up was 36 months. Toxicity: Three toxic deaths are registered, one large bowel perforation, one fulminant hepatic necrosis and one septic shock. Hematological toxicity grade 4 was seen in 78% of the patients, infection grade 4 in 8%. Radiotherapy was given to 16% of the patients. Response: Response rates at end of therapy: CR/CRu: 69%, PR: 22%, SD: 1%, PD: 4.5%. Seventeen patients (7%) were not treated according to protocol, either due to lack of response (6 patients) or due to toxicity (eleven patients). The majority of the PR patients were considered to have residual masses and not viable tumour tissue. Survival: Three year overall survival was 80% (95% CI +/\u2212 6.5%) and three year treatment failure free time 67% (95% CI +/\u22128.0%). CNS events: Seven patients had a CNS relapse, all but one were isolated (4 intracerebral, 3 meningeal). All CNS relapses occurred within 6 months after inclusion. Conclusions: The results are promising with a low three year treatment failure rate, a low toxic death rate and fewer CNS events than expected. The CNS events might be further reduced by earlier CNS prophylaxis.
