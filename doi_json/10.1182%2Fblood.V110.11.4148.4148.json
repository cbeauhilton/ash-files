    "abstract_text": "The p73 , a homologue to the tumor suppressor gene p53 , is involved in oncogenesis, although its specific role remains unclear. This gene has two distinct promoters which encode for two protein isoforms with opposite transcriptional activities: full-length TAp73 and the \u0394Np73, the latter differing by the lack of the N-terminal transactivating domain and, has a dominant-negative function towards p53 and TAp73 activity. In the present study, we have investigated, by Real Time PCR, the gene expression pattern of TA p73 and \u0394N p73 in 147 samples from patients with de novo AML and 22 samples of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from bone marrow of healthy donors. We detected a significantly higher expression of TA p73 and \u0394N p73 genes in AML samples compared to normal hematopoietic progenitors. AML samples harboring the chromosomal translocations: PML-RAR a, AML1-ETO and CBF \u03b2- MYH11 presented significantly higher levels of the TA p73 than those negative for these rearrangements. In contrast, samples without these gene rearrangements expressed higher levels of the truncated form \u0394N p73 . No difference was observed among patients with PML-RAR a, AML1-ETO and CBF \u03b2- MYH11 . In order to determine if the ratio between the relative expression of TAp73 and \u0394N p73 genes was associated with differential susceptibility to pro-apoptotic stimuli, we performed an in vitro cytotoxicity assay using Ara-C. Blasts from 20 AML patients were incubated for 24 hours in a medium containing 100\u03bcg-ml of Ara-C and evaluated for apoptosis status using Anexin V and Propidium Iodite. The leukemic cells with a higher \u0394N p73 / TA p73 ratio were significantly more apoptosis-resistant (Pearson\u2019s R 2 : \u22120.607). We also assessed the protein expression by flow cytometry using saturating amounts of specific antibodies for each isoform and analyzing the mean fluorescence channel. Estimated protein expression corroborated the gene expression results. Our results suggest an association between the presence of PML-RAR \u03b1, AML1-ETO or CBF \u03b2- MYH11 chromosomal translocation and a higher TA p73 gene expression compared to \u0394N p73 isoforms expression in AML samples. Moreover, the higher resistence to apoptosis detected in blasts with higher \u0394N p73 / TA p73 values suggest that this pathway may contribute to prognosis."
