    "abstract_text": "Clinical characteristics of Japanese patients with t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have not been well described. From January 2000 to December 2005, a total of 147 Japanese adult de novo AML (FAB: M2) patients were newly diagnosed with t(8;21) AML (n=46) or without t(8;21) AML (n=101) in collaborating hospitals. Patients with t(8;21) (median age, 49.5 years; range, 18\u201386 years) were significantly younger than AML(M2) patients without t(8;21) (median age, 60 years; range 17\u201390 years) (p<0.001). Three-year overall survival rate in patients with t(8;21) was 70% (95% confidence interval (CI), 51\u201383%), significantly better than that in AML (M2) patients without t(8;21) (log-rank test, p=0.005) (Figure). Among patients <60-years-old, overall survival rates of patients with t(8;21) AML and patients with non-t(8;21) AML(M2) were 71% (95%CI, 47\u201386%) and 58% (95%CI, 41\u201372%), respectively (log-rank test, p=0.28). Of the 40 patients who achieved complete remission, 21 patients received high-dose cytarabine-containing consolidation therapy. Event-free survival rates at 3 years after diagnosis in patients with and without high-dose cytarabine were 60% (95%CI, 36\u201378%) and 57% (95%CI, 26\u201379%), respectively (log-rank, p=0.87). In multivariate analysis, age and white blood cell count at diagnosis represented significant predictors of overall survival. For the 147 AML(M2) patients, presence of t(8;21) was not a significant predictor of overall survival after adjusting for age (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95%CI, 0.34\u20131.24; p=0.19). Japanese patients with t(8;21) AML display more favorable survival rates than those in Western countries. Efficacy of high-dose cytarabine might differ between Japanese and Western patients. Clinicians must be aware of potential differences among different ethnicities. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure  Close modal",
