    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2451 Poster Board II-428 Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative therapy for a variety of malignancies. HCT provides disease eradication through both the high-dose conditioning regimen and an allogeneic graft versus tumor effect (GVT), however graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major obstacle. In a murine aHCT model of bioluminescence imaging (BLI) we have previously demonstrated that acute GVHD can be separated to a GVHD initiation phase confined to secondary lymphoid organs and a subsequent GVHD effector phase in peripheral target tissues. It has been proposed that host conditioning may not only be crucial in the activation of alloreactive T cells but also determine acute GVHD organ manifestation in the effector phase. Here we wanted to investigate how the host conditioning regimen affects the host target tissues in terms of inflammatory cytokines and their role in donor T cell recruitment. We compared lethally irradiated (8Gy) vs. non-irradiated Balb/c wild type or Balb/c Rag-/-cGC-/- (H-2d) -DKO mice that received allogeneic luciferase+ FVB/N T cells (H-2q). Surprisingly, we did not observe marked differences in the donor T cell proliferation (BLI, CFSE), acquisition of activation markers (CD25, CD44, CD69) and homing receptors (a4b7, aEb7, P-selectin ligand, E-selecting ligand) in conditioned, non-conditioned Balb/c Rag-/-cGC-/-. Despite the upregulation of these homing receptors on donor T cells, infiltration of target tissues (intestinal tract, liver and skin) was significantly accelerated in conditioned and delayed in non-conditioned hosts. As T cell recruitment may have occurred as a result of alterations of the milieu inflammatory cytokines in GVHD target tissues, we compared the cytokine profile in conditioned vs. non-conditioned recipients. At days 3 and 6 after transplantation tissues were harvested and cytokines from the target tissues; liver, large bowel, small bowel, peripheral blood and a non target tissue: kidney were analyzed for a TH1/TH2/Th17a cytokines. At day 3 high levels of INF-\u03b3 and TNF were detected in the Balb/c WT conditioned host compared to the non-conditioned host in all target tissues (SB, LB, and liver) and most markedly in peripheral blood and the large bowel. More importantly the Balb/c Rag-/-cGC-/- conditioned host displayed about 5 times higher levels of both inflammatory cytokines compared to the non conditioned DKO hosts and to the Balb/c WT. Similar results with a lesser levels were observed both for IL-2 and IL17a. By day 6 similar results are seen but with a much reduced expression of the cytokines, indicating that the cytokine storm peak was maybe at day 3. In summary host conditioning is not a requirement for alloreactive T cell activation rather induced inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and INF-\u03b3 are the determinant factors for effector T cell recruitment to GVHD target tissues.
