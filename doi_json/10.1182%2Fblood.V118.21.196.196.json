    "abstract_text": "Abstract 196 ADAMTS13 is a plasma metalloproteinase that regulates platelet adhesion and aggregation by virtue of its ability to process newly released ultra-large von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers on the surface of endothelial cells. Autoantibodies directed against ADAMTS13 prohibit the processing of VWF multimers initiating a rare and life-threatening disorder called acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). HLA-DRB1*11 has recently been identified as a risk factor for acquired TTP. This finding implies that formation of autoantibodies towards ADAMTS13 depends on appropriate presentation of ADAMTS13 derived peptides to CD4+ T-cells by antigen presenting cells. Here, we investigate endocytosis of recombinant ADAMTS13 by immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (iDCs) using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Upon incubation of fluorescently labeled-rADAMTS13 with DCs, a time- and concentration dependent uptake of ADAMTS13 was observed. Endocytosis of ADAMTS13 was completely blocked upon addition of EGTA and mannan. We subsequently explored involvement of C-type lectins (CLRs) in the uptake of ADAMTS13 using specific blocking antibodies and siRNA silencing. We found that ADAMTS13 endocytosis was significantly decreased in cells treated with a monoclonal antibody directed towards macrophage mannose receptor (MR). Furthermore siRNA silencing of MR reduced the uptake of ADAMTS13 by dendritic cells. In vitro binding studies revealed that ADAMTS13 interacts with the carbohydrate recognition domains of MR. These data show that ADAMTS13 is internalized by iDCs in a MR-dependent manner. Antigen presenting cells continuously process endogenous and exogenous antigens into small peptides that are loaded on MHC class I or MHC class II for presentation to T lymphocytes. We have recently developed a method to analyze HLA-DR-presented peptide repertoires of dendritic cells pulsed with antigen (van Haren et al., 2011). Here, we addressed which ADAMTS13-derived peptides were presented on MHC class II alleles of a panel of both HLA-DRB1*11 positive and negative donors. Compared to previous studies with model antigens only a limited number of ADAMTS13-derived peptides were presented on MHC class II. Inspection of peptide-profiles obtained from DRB1*11 positive individuals revealed that two antigenic \u201ccore\u201d peptides derived from the CUB1-2 domains of ADAMTS13 were presented by a DR11-positive donor. In addition to these immuno-dominant peptides several other peptides were also presented although with a markedly reduced efficiency. Our findings show that DRB1*11 expressing antigen presenting cells preferentially present antigenic \u201ccore\u201d peptides derived from the CUB1-2 domains of ADAMTS13. We hypothesize that functional presentation of these peptides on HLA-DRB1*11 contributes to the onset of acquired TTP by stimulating low affinity self-reactive CD4+ T cells that have escaped negative selection in the thymus.
