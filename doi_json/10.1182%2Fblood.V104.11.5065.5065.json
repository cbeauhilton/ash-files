    "abstract_text": "Randomized studies after conventional allografting showed that in combination with methotrexate TAC was superior to cyclosporine for prevention of acute GVHD. Using the Seattle conditioning regimen of FLU/low-dose TBI we evaluated TAC/MMF as a substitute for cyclosporine/MMF as post-grafting immunosuppression after MSD PBPC NST. Thirty-two patients (median age 57, range 32\u201368 years), who were poor candidates for a conventional myeloablative transplant, were enrolled. Patient diagnoses included lymphoma (N=12) (7 follicular, 2 transformed, 1 mantle-cell, 1 diffuse large cell, 1 NK), myeloma (N=12), high-grade MDS (N=5), AML (N=2), Hodgkin\u2019s (N=1). Patients were conditioned with FLU (30 mg/m 2 /d x 3), TBI (200 cGy), were infused donor PBPCs on day 0, and received GVHD prophylaxis with TAC (0.06 mg/kg PO b.i.d. from day \u22123), targeting initially 10\u201320 ng/mL, and MMF (15 mg/kg PO b.i.d., from day 0 to +27, discontinued without taper). TAC was tapered from day +100 to +180 and from day +35 to +56, in those patients with indolent (N=25) and aggressive malignancies (N=7), respectively. Regimen toxicities and myelosuppression were mild, allowing 75% of patients to have entirely outpatient transplantations. One patient (3%) experienced a non-fatal graft rejection. The % patients with mixed/donor T-cell chimerism were as follows: 1 month: 77%/23%, 3 mo: 86%/14%, and 1 yr: 20%/80%. Five patients (15.6%) experienced stage II\u2013IV acute GVHD, presenting at median day +61. Eleven patients (34%) experienced chronic GVHD (1 limited, 10 extensive) at median onset day +190. In 6 of those patients (22%), chronic CVHD was not elicited by immunosuppression withdrawal or DLI upon tumor progression. Day+100 transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 0%. Overall TRM was 9%, with 3 deaths from GVHD-related multiorgan failure on days +105, +343, and +354, respectively. At median follow-up of 19 (2\u201341) months, 20 patients (62.5%) were alive, 17 patients (53%) remained progression-free, 13 of them (41%) in complete remission. Median progression-free and overall survival times were 21 and 33 months, respectively. Conclusion : TAC/MMF after a MSD NST provides effective acute GVHD prophylaxis, and is associated with an excellent early safety profile. As compared to reported outcomes with cyclosporine/MMF, acute GVHD incidence appeared lower and onset was delayed."
