    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) accounts for 15-20% of NHL and is characterized by a poor survival. The IPI and PIT scores are prognostic factors in survival in B-cell and T-cell lymphomas, but not without limitations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic value of the NCCN-IPI score in patients with PTCL-NOS. Methods: We included patients with a pathological diagnosis of PTCL-NOS who were diagnosed and treated at our institution between 1997 and 2017. IRB approval was obtained prior to research. Pathological samples were reviewed by hematopathologists at our institution to confirm the diagnosis. Pertinent clinicopathological data were collected through chart review and are presented using descriptive statistics. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazard regression models were fitted to evaluate hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 173 patients with diagnosis of PTCL-NOS were included in this analysis. The median age at diagnosis was 58 years (range 18-91 years) with a male predominance (58%). Clinically, 47% of patients were 60 or older, 52% presented with ECOG >1, 82% had elevated serum LDH, 74% had extranodal disease, and 34% had stage I/II and 66% had stage III/IV. IPI score distribution was low-risk in 55% of patients, low-intermediate in 36%, high-intermediate in 48% and high-risk in 33%. PIT score distribution was low-risk in 53%, low-intermediate in 67%, high-intermediate in 38% and high-risk in 14%. NCCN-IPI score distribution was low risk in 40%, low-intermediate in 56%, high- intermediate in 63% and high risk in 11%. 22% of patients received CHOEP, 23% received CHOP, and 55% received other regimens. The overall response rate was 59%; 47% had a complete response and 12% had a partial response. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 32% with a median OS of 12 months. PTCL-NOS patients with low, low-intermediate, high-intermediate and high-risk NCCN-IPI had 5-year OS rates of 46%, 36%, 26% and 0%, respectively (p<0.001). When compared with patients with low-risk NCCN-IPI, patients with low-intermediate (HR 3.2, 95% CI,1.1-9.5; p=0.044) and high-intermediate /high risk NCCN-IPI (HR 6.0, 95% CI 2.1-17; p=0.001) had worse OS. Conclusions: We have validated the NCCN-IPI score as a prognostic tool in patients with PTCL-NOS. This work can serve to address future prospective designs that allow selection of groups of patients at greater risk and thus lead to more individualized therapy. Figure.
