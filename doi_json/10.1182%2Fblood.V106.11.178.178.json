    "abstract_text": "The protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 is expressed at high levels in leukemic B-cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with progressive disease and short survival. ZAP-70 is a key component of the proximal T-cell receptor signaling pathway and is highly homologous to Syk, an important B-cell receptor signaling (BCR) molecule. Recent studies indicate that ZAP-70 may participate in BCR signaling as well, but the mechanism of action is still not well understood. In T-cells, upon TCR stimulation ZAP-70 becomes phosphorylated on Tyr 319 by the Src-like kinase Lck, which results in the release of the ZAP-70 kinase domain from an autoinhibited state to a fully active conformation. The Tyr 319 site in ZAP-70 corresponds to the Tyr 352 site in Syk, which is phosphorylated in B-cells following BCR stimulation. We therefore investigated the activation status of ZAP-70 and Syk in BCR stimulated CLL B-cells, using phosphorylation of Tyr 319 and Tyr 352 as markers of their activation. Analysis of 10 ZAP-70-positive CLL samples by immunoblotting with the phospho-ZAP70 Tyr319 /Syk Tyr352 antibody revealed that ZAP-70 is not phosphorylated at this site either before or after BCR stimulation, although in control experiments with Jurkat T-cells ZAP-70 became phosphorylated on Tyr 319 upon TCR stimulation. Moreover, the Tyr 352 site in Syk was phosphorylated following BCR stimulation in 6 of the 10 CLL B-cell samples. To further investigate the reasons for the unexpected lack of ZAP-70 activation in CLL B-cells, we produced stable transfectants of the BJAB lymphoma B-cell line that expressed ZAP-70 at levels similar to those found in CLL cases with progressive disease. In agreement with the CLL B-cell experiments, the Tyr 319 site in ZAP-70 was not phosphorylated either before or after BCR stimulation. Since phosphorylation of Tyr 319 is Lck-dependent in T-cells, and this kinase is expressed also in CLL B-cells, we ectopically expressed Lck in the ZAP-70-positive BJAB clones. Again, the Tyr 319 site was not phosphorylated, indicating that ZAP-70 does not undergo activation of the kinase domain also in this cellular system. In contrast, BCR crosslinking in BJAB cells induced significant phosphorylation of Tyr 352 in Syk, which was further enhanced in the clones that coexpressed ZAP-70. Furthermore, analysis of downstream signaling pathways following BCR stimulation showed stronger and prolonged activation of ERK and to a lesser extent Akt in the ZAP-70 positive clones, whereas no difference was observed in terms of activation of PLC-\u03b3 2, JNK and degradation of the NF-kB inhibitor IkB. These data indicate that ZAP-70 does not undergo full activation in B-cells, but can still enhance activation of certain downstream BCR signaling pathways, possibly by affecting the activity of the related PTK Syk.",
