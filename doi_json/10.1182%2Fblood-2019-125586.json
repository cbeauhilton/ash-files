    "abstract_text": "The liver stores iron and senses systemic and tissue iron availability. Hepatocytes control iron homeostasis by producing the peptide hormone hepcidin that controls dietary iron absorption and iron release from intracellular stores. Recent data challenged the exclusive role of hepatocytes in controlling iron levels. Indeed, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) increase BMP2 and BMP6 levels in response to iron, which control hepcidin expression in a paracrine manner. However the molecular mechanism(s) of how BMPs respond to iron levels remain unknown. We established primary murine LSEC cultures and exposed these to iron sources. Unexpectedly, BMP2 mRNA expression is strongly reduced by iron treatment, while BMP6 levels are only mildly increased. This finding suggests that intracellular iron content cannot directly activate BMP2 transcription and only slightly contribute to BMP6 upregulation in LSEC cultures. However, if LSECs are co-cultured with iron-loaded primary hepatocytes the expression of BMP2 and BMP6 is increased and the fold induction of BMP6 is greater compared to LSECs cultured alone, suggesting that the iron status of hepatocytes instructs the LSEC BMP response. These data are supported by findings in a genetic mouse model of iron overload ( Slc40a1 C326S/C326S ). Hepatocytes isolated from Slc40a1 C326S/C326S mice display an iron-loaded molecular signature and the expected low mRNA expression of Transferrin Receptor 1 ( Tfr1 ). By contrast, LSECs show high expression of Tfr1 , indicating intracellular iron deficiency. Despite this, hepatic BMP levels are increased, suggesting that BMP2 and BMP6 expression are directly related to the intracellular iron content of hepatocytes but not LSECs. RNA-sequencing of isolated hepatic cell populations is ongoing to identify putative hepatocyte regulators involved in the iron-mediated BMP2 and BMP6 regulation.
