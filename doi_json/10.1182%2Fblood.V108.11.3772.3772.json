    "abstract_text": "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is one of the bone marrow failure syndromes, including aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Recently, the International PNH Interest Group proposed that evidence of a population of erythrocytes and granulocytes deficient in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) proteins and assessment of hemolytic parameters, including haptoglobin concentration, are important as minimal essential diagnostic criteria of PNH and that less than 1.0% GPI-deficient erythrocytes and granulocytes identifies subclinical PNH from classic PNH (Parker C et al, Blood, 2005). To know whether haptoglobin can be a hallmark which expects the occurrence of classic PNH during the clinical course in AA and MDS patients, we examined the expressions of CD59 on erythrocytes and granulocytes by flow cytometry and relationship between proportions of negative populations of them and various clinical parameters, including haptoglobin concentrations, in Japanese patients with AA (n=23; M:F=11:12; 50.5 \u00b1 19.1 years), PNH (n=28; M:F=14:14; 42.7 \u00b1 16.1 years), and MDS (n=29; M:F=20:9; 66.1 \u00b1 13.9 years). Less than 20 mg/dl of haptoglobin were judged as significant decrease. Flow cytometry showed that the proportions of CD59 \u2212 erythrocytes (38.11 \u00b1 35.49%) and granulocytes (52.57 \u00b1 42.39%) from PNH patients were significantly higher than those from AA and MDS patients and healthy individuals (n=21; M:F=12:9; 41.3 \u00b1 12.2 years). The values of serum asparatate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly higher in PNH patients (54.9 \u00b1 53.1U/l and 1035 \u00b1 1052 U/l, respectively) than AA (20.8 \u00b1 9.1 U/l and 205.8 \u00b1 45.0 U/l, respectively) and MDS (22.4 \u00b1 16.9 U/l and 217.7 \u00b1 64.0 U/l, respectively) patients. In contrast, the concentrations of serum haptoglobin were significantly lower in PNH patients (12.9 \u00b1 27.6 mg/dl) than AA (84.6 \u00b1 81.9 mg/dl) and MDS (77.7 \u00b1 47.3 mg/dl) patients. When comparing PNH patients (n=9; minimal PNH) with less than 5% of CD59 \u2212 erythrocytes with those (n=19; bulky PNH) with over 5% of CD59 \u2212 erythrocytes, the values of AST (70.7 \u00b1 58.2U/l) and LDH (1021 \u00b1 1083U/l) of the latter were significantly higher than those of the former (21.4 \u00b1 6.2U/l and 220.3 \u00b1 45.1U/l, respectively), but the concentrations of haptoglobin were similar between the latter (11.8 \u00b1 28.9mg/dl) and the former (15.8 \u00b1 26.0mg/dl). In addition, all the PNH patients, but not AA and MDS patients, with over 1% of CD59 \u2212 erythrocytes had significant decrease of haptoglobin concentration, suggesting that low concentrations of serum haptoglobin may predict occurrence of classic PNH during the clinical course in AA and MDS patients. In conclusion, over 1% of CD59 \u2212 erythrocytes in PNH patients certainly cause clinical hemolysis and serum haptoglobin is a useful marker which can predict the occurrence of classic PNH.",
