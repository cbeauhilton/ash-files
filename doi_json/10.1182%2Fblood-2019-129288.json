    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Cytopenias are a leading cause of ruxolitinib (RUX) discontinuation for patients (pts) with myelofibrosis (MF). Though RUX 5 mg BID is recommended for pts with platelet (PLT) counts of 50 to <100 \u00d7 10 9 /L, this regimen can increase risk of thrombocytopenia with minimal benefit on splenomegaly or symptom burden. Fedratinib (FEDR) is an oral, selective inhibitor with activity against wild-type and mutant JAK2 that was assessed as first-line MF treatment (Tx) in the placebo (PBO)-controlled, phase III JAKARTA study, and as post-RUX Tx in the single-arm, phase II JAKARTA2 study. Here we report the efficacy and safety of FEDR 400 mg QD in JAKARTA and JAKARTA2 pts with baseline (BL) PLT counts of <100 \u00d7 10 9 /L (\"<100\") or \u2265100 \u00d7 10 9 /L (\"\u2265100\"). Methods: JAKARTA and JAKARTA2 enrolled adult pts with intermediate- or high-risk MF, PLT counts \u226550 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and ECOG PS scores \u22642. These analyses include pts in both studies who received FEDR 400 mg QD (starting dose), and JAKARTA pts randomized to PBO. Outcomes are also assessed for a subgroup of JAKARTA2 pts who met new, more stringent criteria for RUX relapsed/refractory (R/R) or intolerant (\"Stringent Criteria Cohort\"). RUX R/R required \u22653 mo RUX Tx with an initial response followed by spleen regrowth or suboptimal response; RUX intolerance required \u226528 d of RUX Tx with development of RBC transfusion requirement or grade \u22653 cytopenias, hematoma, or hemorrhage. Endpoints of this analysis were spleen volume response rate (SVRR; the proportion of pts who achieved \u226535% spleen volume reductions) and symptom response rate (RR; \u226550% reduction in total symptom score [TSS] on the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form [MFSAF] from BL to end of cycle 6 [EOC6]). SVRR analyses were intention-to-treat (ITT); pts missing data at EOC6 were considered nonresponders. Results : In JAKARTA, the overall SVRR at EOC6 in the FEDR 400 mg and PBO arms was 47% and 1%, respectively ( P <0.0001); median duration of spleen volume response with FEDR was 18.2 mo. In all, 14/96 pts (15%) in the FEDR arm and 18/96 pts (19%) in the PBO arm had BL PLT counts <100. SVRRs with FEDR and PBO in pts with BL PLT counts <100 ( Figure ) were 36% and 0%, respectively ( Table ). SVRR and symptom RR with FEDR and PBO in pts with BL PLT counts <100 were similar to those in pts with BL PLT counts \u2265100 ( Table ). In the BL PLT 99%. At EOC6, rates of grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia (preferred term) for all pts in the JAKARTA FEDR 400 mg and PBO arms were 5% and 6%, respectively; in the subgroup of pts with BL PLT counts <100, rates were also similar between Tx arms (FEDR, 29%; PBO, 22%). Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia events in the FEDR 400 mg arm led to dose modifications in 1% of pts and permanent Tx discontinuation in 2% of pts, all of whom had BL PLT counts <100. In JAKARTA2, median prior RUX Tx duration for all pts (N=97) was 10.7 mo. SVRR overall was 31% ( Figure ) and symptom RR was 27%. Median duration of spleen volume response was not reached at study termination. Among pts with BL PLT counts <100 (n=33), SVRR was 36% and symptom RR was 39% ( Table ). In the Stringent Criteria Cohort (n=79), SVRR for pts with BL PLT counts <100 (n=28) was 39% and symptom RR was 36%. In both the ITT Population and the Stringent Criteria Cohort, SVRR and symptom RR were comparable between pts with BL PLT counts <100 and those with BL PLT counts \u2265100 (n=64; Table ). Median duration of FEDR Tx in pts with BL PLT counts <100 was 27 wks (range 1-79) and in pts with BL PLT counts \u2265100 was 22 wks (1-71). 91% of pts with BL PLT counts <100 and 97% with BL PLT counts \u2265100 received \u226580% of their intended FEDR dose. Treatment-emergent adverse events were generally similar between PLT groups at EOC6, except for a higher frequency of expected grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia among pts with BL PLT counts <100 (49% vs. 8% in the BL PLT \u2265100 group). Among all pts in JAKARTA2, grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia events led to dose modification in 4 pts (3 pts with BL PLT counts <100) and Tx discontinuation in 2 pts (1 pt with BL PLT count <100). Conclusion : Pts with MF who entered JAKARTA or JAKARTA2 with PLT counts <100 \u00d7 10 9 /L achieved similar spleen volume and symptom RRs with FEDR, whether used as first-line therapy, as pts with BL PLT counts \u2265100 \u00d7 10 9 /L. FEDR was generally well tolerated in pts with very low PLT counts at BL. FEDR is a promising new Tx option for pts with MF and low PLT counts who might otherwise receive suboptimal Tx.
