    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2308 Low molecular weight heparins such as enoxaparin and dalteparin are widely used for the management of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). Recently, several generic versions of enoxaparin and dalteparin have been approved in various countries for all of the branded product's indications. However, no data on their clinical equivalence in ACS is available. Since generic versions of enoxaparin and dalteparin are manufactured by different processes and may use starting material from different sources, these drugs may differ in their pharmacological profile in simulated ACS settings. To compare the pharmacodynamic effects, a branded version of enoxaparin was compared with three generic versions in a primate model at a dosage of 1 mg/kg IV. Such pharmacokinetic parameters as TFPI release, TAFI modulation, vWF release, and TF mediated platelet activation were measured. Anticoagulant effects of these drugs were also measured after IV administration using iSTAT ACT and aPTT. Simulated catheter related thrombosis studies were carried out to differentiate each agent in contact, intrinsic and extrinsic clotting systems. The generic versions of enoxaparin namely, Cutenox (Gland Pharma), Fibrinox (Sandoz AG) and Versa (EuroPharma) exhibited product based pharmacodynamic differences compared with the branded product and the results are provided in the following table. Each of the generic products exhibited its own specific pharmacologic profile despite comparable molecular weight distributions and anti-Xa potencies. Significant differences were noted in the anticoagulant effects of each of these agents as compared with the branded products. Some differences were also noted in HIT antibody mediated aggregation studies. The differences between the branded and generic versions of LMWHs may be due to the higher dosages used and the IV administration which leads to higher circulating levels of these agents. These observations suggest the need for additional animal studies and clinical trials to validate the use of generic versions of LMWHs in such critical indications as ACS and related syndromes.
