    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4798 Background: Acute monocytic leukemia (M5) is one kind of acute leukemia with poor prognosis, which has the characterization of high number of white blood cells, high risk of extramedullary metastasis and abnormal chromosome karyotype. Objective: To analyze clinical characterization and prognostic factors of adult acute monocytic leukemia. Methods: Clinical data of 144 patients diagnosed between Jan 1st 2006 and Dec 31 2010 were collected. Clinical manifestation, cytogenetics, immunophenotyping and minimal residual disease (MRD) were analyzed respectively. The numeration data was tested by \u03c7 2 test, while the measurement data by Levene test to variance homogeneity and by T test to the mean difference. The data were analyzed by SPSS 17.0. Results: 81.9% of 144 patients reached complete remission. 27.5% patients were abnormal in cytogenetics, including +8, \u22125/del (5q), \u22127/del (7q). Patients were divided into three groups according to chromosome karyotype. Intermediate prognostic group has better OS and DFS than poor prognostic group (P<0.05). 26 patients treated with SCT.These patients have higher OS rate for one year and low relapse rate than those who did not receive SCT.CR rate for old patients(\u226555) and young patients (<55) were 69.4% and 86.1% respectively. Old patients had shorter OS and DFS than young patients, but no singnificant difference in FAB type, number of white blood cell and immunophenotyping. Old patients occur chromosome abnormalities more frequently than young patients. Relapse rate is 20.7% in MRD+ group versus 11.5% in MRD- group. Multivariate COX analysis showed that chromosome karyotype and MRD had most significant correlation with relapse. Conclusion: Chromosome karyotype, age, therapy, MRD were all prognostic factors of M5. Chromosome karyotype and MRD had most important significance in prognosis.
