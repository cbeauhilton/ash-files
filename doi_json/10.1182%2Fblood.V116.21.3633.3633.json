    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3633 Circadian rhythm is present in human and all eukaryotes with a 24-hour cycle. Circadian genes use transcriptional-translational feedback loops to control circadian rhythms. Therefore, the marked characteristic of circadian systems is the strong daily cycling of clock gene mRNA, clock protein, and clock-controlled gene RNA and protein. Recent studies have demonstrated that expression of some of the circadian genes display daily oscillation in peripheral tissues including liver, eye, lung, heart, spleen, kidney, peripheral blood and bone marrow. Circadian rhythms regulate various functions of human body and disruption of circadian rhythm has been associated with cancer development and tumor progression. In this study the expression profiles of the 9 circadian genes ( hPER1 , hPER2 , hPER3 , hCRY1 , hCRY2 , hCLOCK , hBMAL1 , hCK1e and hTIM ) in peripheral blood (PB) total leukocytes from 95 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 54 healthy volunteers were investigated. For comparison of circadian gene expression between PB mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and polymorphonuclear cells (PMNLs), another group of 10 healthy volunteers were also investigated. Collection of PB was carried out at four time points: 20:00, 02:00, 08:00, and 14:00, respectively. In healthy individuals, the daily oscillation was shown for hPER1 , hPER2 , hPER3 , and hCRY2 with peak expression levels at 8:00AM, and the expression of the nine genes displayed similar profile both in PBMCs and in PMNs. In contrast, oscillations of these four genes were abolished in newly diagnosed pre-imatinib mesylate treated and blast crisis-phase CML patients and partial recoveries of oscillations were observed in CML patients with complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response. In some serial monitored individual patients, the recoveries of oscillations of circadian gene expression accompanied with the disappearance of BCR-ABL transcripts were also noted. Expression of hCRY1 , hCLOCK , hBMAL1 , hCK1e and hTIM did not oscillate both in healthy individuals and CML patients. Updated results on more healthy volunteers and serial monitored CML patients will be presented at the meeting. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
