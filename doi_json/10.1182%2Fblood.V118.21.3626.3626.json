    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3626 Introduction: Although there have been remarkable improvements in treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the prognosis of AML in elderly patients remains poor, and the best induction chemotherapy for these patients remains yet unknown. To devise an effective induction regimen for elderly patients with AML, we conducted a phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the modified fludarabine, cytarabine, and attenuated-dose idarubicin (m-FLAI) regimen in these patients. Patients and Methods: Elderly (60 years or older) AML patients who did not receive previous chemotherapy were enrolled. Patients received two consecutive cycles of m-FLAI chemotherapy as an induction. The m-FLAI regimen was comprised of fludarabine (25mg/m 2 , days 1\u20134), cytarabine (1000mg/m 2 , days 1\u20134), and attenuated-dose idarubicin (5mg/m 2 , days 1\u20133). The primary end point was complete remission (CR) rate. Results: A total of 108 patients (median age 68.4 years, M:F=64:44) were enrolled. CR was achieved in 62.9% of patients, and treatment-related mortality rate (TRM) was 25.8%. Median overall survival (OS) was 9.3 months, and median event-free survival (EFS) was 6.6 months. The mortality at 30 and 60 days was 18% and 24%, respectively. Performance status and comorbidity did not have prognostic value in these patients. Bone marrow expression of CD117 was related to long EFS and OS. Conclusion: In conclusion, m-FLAI is a safe and effective induction regimen for previously untreated AML in elderly patients. Bone marrow CD117 expression is an independent good prognostic factor in these patients.
