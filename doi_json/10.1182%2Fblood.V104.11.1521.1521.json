    "abstract_text": "Background : Neutrophil PRV-1 over-expression has been strongly associated with polycythemia vera (PV) and its quantitative measurement might complement the diagnostic distinction between PV and secondary polycythemia ( Klippel et al. Blood  2003 ; 102 : 3569 ). Furthermore, the PV-specificity of the particular abnormality had been suggested by studies that demonstrated increased PRV-1 expression in post-polycythemic but not agnogenic myeloid metaplasia ( Tefferi et al. Blood  2003 ; 103 : 3547 ) as well as by other studies that suggested the inevitable progression into PV of essential thrombocythemia (ET) associated with PRV-1 over-expression ( Griesshammer et al. Ann Hematol  2004 ; 83 : 364 ). Still others have suggested the possibile utility of the particular assay in differentiating clonal from reactive myeloproliferation ( Cilloni et al. Blood  2004 ; 103 : 2428 ). Methods : The purpose of the current study was two-fold; i) to further evaluate the specificity of neutrophil PRV-1 over expression to either PV or clonal myeloproliferation by testing the assay in atypical myeloproliferative disorders (AMPD) and ii) to evaluate eosinophil PRV-1 expression in AMPD associated with eosinophilia. In a prospective study, 13 patients with AMPD and 2 with reactive eosinophilia were evaluated for neutrophil PRV-1 expression (table 1). PRV-1 transcript quantitation was performed according to published methods ( Klippel et al. Blood  2003 ; 102 : 3569 ). PRV-1 gene expression was considered elevated in the presence of a PRV-1/GAPDH ratio of 1.17 or lower. Table 1  Patient . Diagnosis . Neutrophil PRV-1/GAPDH ratio .

Results : Table 1 outlines specific diagnoses as well as the corresponding neutrophil PRV-1 expression levels in all 15 patients tested (median age 54 years, range 20\u201374; 11 males). Eosinophil PRV-1 expression was normal in all 5 patients tested (range of PRV-1/GAPDH ratio between 1.20\u20131.39). Conclusion : The current study suggests that neutrophil PRV-1 over-expression is a non-specific marker of clonal myeloproliferation that is seen in a broad spectrum of both typical and atypical myeloid disorders. As has been the case in ET, only a subset of AMPD patients display the specific abnormality, thus undermining its diagnostic utility. The preliminary information from the current study does not suggest increased eosinophil PRV-1 expression in either HES or clonal eosinophilia.",
