    "abstract_text": "Background: Heart failure secondary to myocardial siderosis remains the main cause of death in regularly transfused patients (pts) with \u03b2-thalassemia, hence the importance of using a chelator that can reduce cardiac iron. Deferasirox (Exjade \u00ae ), a once-daily, oral iron chelator, has demonstrated removal of cardiac iron in preclinical and small clinical studies. The EPIC trial is a 1-yr, multicenter prospective longitudinal study, and is the largest of its kind for any chelation therapy. Here we report the EPIC cardiac sub-study, which evaluates the cardiac efficacy of deferasirox in \u03b2-thalassemia pts with myocardial siderosis. Methods: The sub-study of EPIC included pts with \u03b2-thalassemia aged \u226510 yrs who were eligible for enrollment in the core trial and who had magnetic resonance (MR) myocardial T2* >5\u20132500 ng/mL, MR (R2) liver iron concentration (LIC) >10 mg Fe/g dw, and a lifetime minimum of 50 transfused blood units. Deferasirox was initiated at 30 mg/kg/d and subsequent dose adjustments of 5\u201310 mg/kg/d were based on changes in SF, month-6 cardiac T2* and safety parameters. The primary endpoint was the change in myocardial T2* from baseline to 1 yr. Secondary endpoints included change in LVEF, SF and LIC at 1 yr. Results: Enrolled into this sub-study were 114 pts (54 M, 60 F; mean 20.9\u00b17.3 yrs), of whom the baseline myocardial T2* was <10 ms in 47 (41%), and 10\u201320 ms in 67 (59%). Mean baseline LIC was 28.2\u00b110.0 mg Fe/g dw, median SF 5235 ng/mL, and the mean amount of transfused blood in the previous yr 185 mL/kg. 68% of pts had received prior deferoxamine (DFO) and 32% DFO/deferiprone combination therapy. Mean actual deferasirox dose over 1 yr was 32.6 mg/kg/d. At 1 yr, the myocardial T2* improved significantly from a (geometric mean \u00b1 coefficient of variation) baseline of 11.2 ms \u00b140.5% to 12.9 ms \u00b149.5% ( P <0.0001), representing an increase by a factor of 1.16 from baseline. Significant increases from 7.4 ms \u00b119.4% to 8.2 ms \u00b125.6% ( P =0.0002) and from 14.6 ms \u00b120.9% to 17.4 ms \u00b131.2% ( P 4% increase) was seen in 69.5%; no change in 14.3%; and worsening (>4% decrease) in 16.2%. LVEF remained stable throughout the study: 67.4\u00b15.7% to 67.1\u00b16.0% ( P =ns). Overall both mean LIC and median SF were reduced significantly from baseline by \u22126.6\u00b19.9 mg Fe/g dw and \u22121257 ng/mL ( P 33% above baseline and the upper limit of normal (ULN) on two consecutive visits; there were no progressive increases. Two (1.8%) pts had an increase in alanine aminotransferase >10\u00d7ULN on two consecutive visits; levels were already elevated in these pts. Conclusions: In \u03b2-thalassemia pts with myocardial siderosis, deferasirox at a mean dose of 32.6 mg/kg/d over 1 yr removes iron from the heart. The statistically significant improvement in myocardial T2* was associated with maintained ejection fraction. Concomitantly, a significant decrease in hepatic and total body iron burden was also seen. Deferasirox treatment was generally well tolerated. Ongoing one-yr extension of this sub-study will elucidate further the cardiac efficacy of deferasirox."
