    "abstract_text": "Patients diagnosed with peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) generally had a poorer prognosis compared to B-cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas. With conventional treatment, the 5-year overall and failure-free survivals (OS and FFS) were 36% and 23%, respectively ( Vose et al, Blood  2005 ; 106 : abstract 811 ). Between February 2005 and January 2006, 13 consecutive patients newly diagnosed with PTCL (5, extranodal nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma, 4 subcutaneous panniculitis-like, 3 PTCL, unspecified and 1 enteropathy type) were enrolled. The median age was 44 years (range, 21\u201356) and male:female was 1.6:1. Fifty-four percent had stage III/IV, 31%, PS 2\u20133, 69%, B-symptoms, 15%, bulky disease, 46%, > 1 extranodal site, 38%, elevated serum LDH and 39%, aaIPI 2\u20133. Twenty-three percent had thrombocytopenia. Patients were treated with alemtuzumab 30 mg. sc. D1-3 of cycle 1\u20135 plus CHOP (day 1 of cycle 1, 3, 5) and ESHAP (day 1 of cycle 2, 4, 6) at 28-day intervals. Valacyclovir 500 mg tid and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were given for prophylaxis of CMV and Pneumocystis carinii infection, respectively. Of the evaluable 10 patients, complete remission was obtained in 8 patients, 1 had partial remission and 1 had CNS progression while on treatment. Infection was a major adverse complication: 54% had CMV reactivation (1 had CMV disease), 54%, febrile neutropenia and 15%, tuberculosis. With a median follow-up time of 8 months, the 2-year OS and FFS were 75% (95%CI, 41\u201392) and 48% (95%CI, 14\u201376), respectively. From the standpoint of this result, alemtuzumab in combination with CHOP and ESHAP is an effective front-line therapy for patients newly diagnosed with PTCL."
