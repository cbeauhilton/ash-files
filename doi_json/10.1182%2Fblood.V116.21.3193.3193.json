    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3193 NK cells as part of the innate immune system substantially contribute to cancer immune surveillance. They prevent tumor progression and metastasis due to their ability to mediate cellular cytotoxicity and to produce cytokines like IFN-\u03b3, which, among others, stimulates subsequent adaptive immune responses. NK reactivity results from an integrative response emerging upon recognition of multiple ligands for activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors including various members of the TNFR family. Apart from the direct interaction with their target cells, NK cell activity is further influenced by the reciprocal interplay with various other hematopoietic cells like e.g. dendritic cells. Metastatic tumor spread in experimental animals is dramatically reduced in thrombopenic mice. Additional depletion of NK cells reverses this effect, indicating that platelets may impair NK anti-tumor reactivity. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated, especially in humans. Recently, we demonstrated that NK anti-tumor immunity is impaired by platelet-derived TGF-\u03b2, which is released upon interaction of platelets with tumor cells ( Kopp et al., Cancer Res. 2009 ). Here we report that the ligand for the TNFR family member GITR (GITRL) is upregulated on megakaryocytes during maturation resulting in substantial GITRL expression by platelets. Since we recently identified GITR as inhibitory NK receptor involved in tumor immune escape (e.g., Baltz et al., Blood 2008, Baessler et al., Cancer Res. 2009 ) we investigated how platelet-derived GITRL influences platelet function and NK immune surveillance. Signaling via GITRL into platelets upon interaction with NK-expressed GITR or recombinant GITR-Ig fusion protein did not alter platelet activation as revealed by analysis of the activation marker CD62P and release of TGF-\u03b2. Interestingly, we found that GITRL-negative tumor cells rapidly get coated by platelets, which confers a seemingly GITRL-positive phenotype. \u201cGITRL pseudoexpression\u201d on tumor cells caused a substantial reduction of NK cell cytotoxicity and cytokine production. This reduced NK reactivity was not due to induction of apoptosis via GITR and could be restored by addition of a blocking GITR antibody. Thus, coating of tumor cells by platelets inhibits NK reactivity, which is in part mediated by platelet-derived GITRL. Our data provide a functional basis for the previously observed finding that platelets increase metastasis i.e. by enabling evasion of tumor cells from NK-mediated immune surveillance.
