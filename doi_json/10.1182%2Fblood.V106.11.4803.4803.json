    "abstract_text": "We previously reported that all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) inhibits growth in HTLV-1-positive T-cell lines and fresh cells from patients with adult T-cell leukemia. However, the mechanism of this inhibition is not clear. In the present study, we observed that NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity as well as cell growth decreased significantly in HTLV-1-positive T-cell lines in the presence of ATRA. Furthermore, we observed that ATRA reduced HTLV-1 proviral DNA, HTLV-1 genes (gag, tax or pol mRNA) using the real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. SIL-2R was reduced by ATRA in both protein level (culture supernantant) and mRNA level in HTLV-1-positive T-cell lines. Interestingly, ATRA significantly inhibited RT activity similar to azidothimidine (AZT) in HTLV-1-positive T-cell lines. Moreover, AZT was inhibitory of proviral DNA but not NF-kB transcriptional activity and sIL-2R on HTLV-1, however ATRA was inhibitory of NF-kB, proviral DNA and sIL-2R on HTLV-1. These results suggested that the decrease of sIL-2R induced by ATRA may be caused by the actions of a NF-kB inhibitor acting on the NF-kB/sIL-2R signal pathway. These results suggested that ATRA could have two roles, as a NF-kB inhibitor and as a RT inhibitor.",
