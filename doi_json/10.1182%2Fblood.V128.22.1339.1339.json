    "abstract_text": "Dendritic cells (DCs) along with mast cells function as sentinels for the innate immune system and perform as antigen presenting cells (APCs) to mount an adaptive immune response against invading pathogen. FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase signaling has been shown to regulate the homeostatic mechanisms of subsets of DCs particularly, CD103 + DCs compared to CD11b + DCs. CD103 + DCs are regarded as APCs with superior capabilities to mount an effective immune response, thus understanding their homeostasis mechanism(s)/function is of paramount importance to devise effective therapeutics including DC vaccines. The Src-like adapter protein (SLAP) has been shown to dampen the signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases including FLT3, cKit, and immune cell receptors including T cell receptor, B cell receptor, and Granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor receptor via by recruiting c-Cbl, an ubiquitin ligase. Here, we report that SLAP deficient mice (KO) have reduced numbers of CD103 + DC in lung while equal numbers in liver and kidney compared to control mice. To further confirm reduced CD103 + DC in the lung, efferocytosis assays that are dependent upon CD + 103 DC in lung epithelium to cleanse the apoptotic cells were performed. Flow cytometric quantification of CD103 + DCs that uptake fluorescently labeled apoptotic cells administered via intranasal route and migrate to mediastinal lymph nodes confirmed reduced number of CD103 + DCs in SLAP KO mice. Further analysis of DC progenitor populations showed reduced pre-DC progenitor in the lung in SLAP KO mice while bone marrow compartment showed equal progenitor populations including pre-DC and common dendritic progenitors suggesting the role of SLAP in localized FLT3 signaling in the lung. Consistently, DCs in lymphoid compartment including spleen, thymus, inguinal and popliteal lymph node did not show any defects. Upon further dissecting the cellular mechanism, SLAP KO DCs showed increased apoptosis while having similar proliferation potential in vivo at steady state.Bone marrow progenitors from SLAP KO mice failed to generate mature DCs in the presence of FLT3 ligand in vitro due to enhanced apoptosis at early time points. Also, submaximal inhibition of FLT3 with an inhibitor, quizartinib partially rescues the apoptotic phenotype of SLAP KO bone marrow progenitors suggesting a cell-intrinsic role of SLAP in the survival of DCs. Biochemical analysis revealed that SLAP is directly recruited to the juxta-membrane residues of the FLT3 receptor in an inducible manner suggesting a direct role of SLAP in the regulation of FLT3 signaling. Phosphoflow analysis of DCs generated in the combined presence of GMCSF and FLT3 ligands showed that SLAP promotes the signaling to SHP2 while perturbs signaling to the mTOR pathway. Together these results suggest that SLAP is a critical regulator of CD103 + DCs homeostasis in selective peripheral organs including the lung.
