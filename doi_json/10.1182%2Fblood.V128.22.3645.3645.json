    "abstract_text": "Allosteric effectors of hemoglobin (AEH) remain promising as a viable therapeutic approach for the management of sickle cell disease (SCD). AEH bind to hemoglobin (Hb) in a transiently covalently manner, increasing Hb affinity for oxygen (O 2 ), with concomitant inhibition of polymerization of deoxygenated sickle Hb (HbS) and erythrocyte sickling. As part of our ongoing efforts to surmount well-known AEH druggability challenges, we have designed and synthesized VZHE-039, a novel substituted benzaldehyde with potent in-vitro anti-polymerization activity, as well as more favorable in-vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties. Here, we report the results of our early findings. The anti-sickling properties of VZHE-039 were tested in-vitro by incubating 0.5, 1, and 2 mM concentrations with blood suspensions from a subject with homozygous SCD (hematocrit: 20%) under hypoxic conditions (4% O 2 /96% N 2 ) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. At conclusion, aliquots were drawn into a fixative (2% glutaraldehyde solution), and sickling was assessed by microscopy. Aliquot samples were also subjected to cation-exchange HPLC analyses to measure the degree of Hb modification (Hb adduct formation), as well as standard O 2 equilibrium curves (OEC) to assess p50 shifts. Subsequently, we conducted in-vivo PK/PD studies in wild-type mice that received single doses of VZHE-039 via the intravenous (I.V.: 25 and 50 mg/kg), intraperitoneal (I.P.: 100-150 mg/kg) and oral (P.O.: 100-200 mg/kg) routes. Serial blood samples were collected up to 24 h after I.V. and P.O., and up to 6 h after I.P. administration, respectively; aliquots were hemolyzed, de-proteinized and subjected to reverse-phase HPLC-UV assay to quantify VZH-039 blood concentrations. Residual blood samples were also hemolyzed, and clarified lysates were assayed for in-vivo Hb adduct formation, and the corresponding change in Hb oxygen affinity (\u0394p50, %). The results of our in-vitro studies demonstrated a concentration-dependent inhibition of SS cell sickling: 39\u00b11.4%, 68.6\u00b14.9%, and 89.9\u00b15.2%, at 0.5, 1 and 2 mM of VZHE-039, respectively. HbS was modified correspondingly (46\u00b17.4%, 83.6\u00b16.4%, and 96.4\u00b16.2%), and this adduct formation was correlated linearly with the left shift in OEC (\u0394p50 values of 34.3\u00b18.7%, 63.6\u00b12.4%, and 76.6\u00b12.5%). Noncompartmental PK analysis showed that, after I.V. administration, systemic PK was dose-independent with a CL tot of 0.5 mL/min/kg, resulting in a terminal half-life of 9 h. After I.P. administration, AUC trap increased supra-proportionally with dose; the limited sampling schedule suggested an I.P. bioavailability of >20%. After P.O. administration, AUC trap increased supra-proportionally with dose as well due to an increase in oral bioavailability to ~ 10%, with peak blood concentrations up to ~ 0.25 mM; the terminal half-lives were prolonged (relative to I.V.) to 14 h. The PD effect-time course of change in %Hb adduct paralleled (and was reasonably linearly related to) blood concentrations for all routes. Baseline-corrected peak PD effects after I.V. administration were 15.7% and 31.9%, after 25 and 50 mg/kg respectively; after P.O. administration of 200 mg/kg, the peak change was 17.6%. Overall, VZHE-039 exhibited a low (metabolic) clearance, presumably reflecting high-affinity and sustained Hb (and possibly albumin) binding, leading to the observed extended terminal half-life and duration of action. While its oral bioavailability is low (likely due to limited GI solubility) and there is evidence of saturable first-pass effects and possibly enterohepatic recycling, oral in-vivo exposures were associated with PD effects that were consistent with the results from the in-vitro studies. In conclusion, the results of our current studies establish VZHE-039 as a novel, potent anti-sickling agent, confirm its proposed mechanism of action in-vitro and in-vivo , and suggest that therapeutically-relevant blood concentrations may be achieved after daily oral doses. Therefore, VZHE-039 is our new lead drug candidate that may require further modifications and studies to (a) improve its GI solubility and oral bioavailability; (b) elucidate atomic level structural interactions and kinetics of its Hb binding; and (c) formally investigate its biological activity after repeat-doses in a SCD mouse model.
