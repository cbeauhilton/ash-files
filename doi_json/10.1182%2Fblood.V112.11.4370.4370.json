    "abstract_text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV), an important cause of mortality after allogeneic HSCT in the past, is now controllable with sensitive monitoring techniques and drugs such as valganciclovir and foscarnet. However, some groups still report that CMV seropositivity influences the outcome adversely. The outcome of 130 reduced-intensity allograft recipients treated uniformly (2001\u20137) was studied to determine the effect of CMV.

Patient or donor CMV status did not affect transplant-related mortality, relapse, or survival, and the outcome of the P+D+, P+D\u2212, P\u2212D+ and P\u2212D\u2212 groups was identical. Not a single death was attributable to CMV infection or adverse effects of anti-viral therapy.

Does younger donor age affect the outcome of reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies beneficially? Bone Marrow Transplant 2006 ; 38 : 95 \u2013100 ). We conclude that intensive monitoring for CMV reactivation, effective anti-viral drugs, and intensive supportive therapy have eliminated the adverse influence of CMV-positivity on the outcome of allogeneic HSCT."
