    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients (pts) with multiple myeloma (MM) experience health-related quality of life (HRQoL) decrement due to symptoms such as fatigue, pain, and insomnia. Pt perspectives of their disease and treatment expectations can help inform clinical decision-making. The phase 1b/2 CARTITUDE-1 study (NCT03548207) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel; JNJ-68284528; LCAR-B38M CAR-T cells), a chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy with 2 B-cell maturation antigen-targeting single-domain antibodies, in pts with relapsed/refractory (R/R) MM. An exploratory objective is to describe pretreatment goals and expectations and post-treatment experience of cilta-cel using qualitative interviews. Methods: Pts (aged \u226518 years) with an MM diagnosis per International Myeloma Working Group criteria who had received \u22653 prior regimens or were double-refractory to a proteasome inhibitor and immunomodulatory drug, and who had received an anti-CD38 antibody were included. On Day 1, cilta-cel (target dose 0.75\u00d710 6 [range 0.5-1.0\u00d710 6 ] CAR+ viable T cells/kg) was given as a single infusion 5-7 days after start of lymphodepletion (cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 + fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 daily for 3 days). In the phase 2 portion, pts had the option to participate in structured qualitative interviews conducted pretreatment, at Day 100 \u00b1 30 (end of cilta-cel post-infusion period), and Day 184 \u00b1 30 (during post-treatment phase). Pretreatment interviews : pts were asked open-ended questions about their experience living with MM and expectations of cilta-cel. Day 100 and 184 interviews : pts were asked about changes to their MM symptoms and daily life impacts, experiences with cilta-cel, and if pretreatment expectations were met. Content analysis of qualitative data was performed by extracting themes from the transcripts based on a coding dictionary. Results: Of 68 pts in the phase 2 portion, 36 (55.6% male; median age: 62.5 years [range: 46-77]) completed \u22651 interview (pretreatment: n=27; Day 100: n=23; Day 184: n=24); 24 pts completed >1 interview and 14 completed all 3 interviews. The most common symptoms reported at the pretreatment interview, pain (85.2% of pts) and fatigue (74.1% of pts), were also frequently considered to have the greatest impact on pts' lives (29.6% and 25.9%, respectively) and identified as symptoms that pts would most like to see improved (25.9% and 33.3%, respectively). After cilta-cel therapy, at Day 100 and 184 interviews, respectively, the proportions of pts who reported pain (21.7% and 29.2%) and fatigue (34.8% and 20.8%) decreased. At the pretreatment interview, pts most frequently reported that MM impacted relationships (92.6%), psychological and emotional functioning (88.9%), and activities of daily living (66.7%). In longitudinal analyses of pts who completed >1 interview, most pts reported either improvement or no change in these impacts at Day 100 and 184 interviews, respectively, (relationships [50.0% and 58.3%], psychological and emotional functioning [77.3% and 83.3%], and activities of daily living [59.1% and 62.5%]), suggesting a diminished impact of MM on HRQoL following cilta-cel treatment. The most common expectations of cilta-cel reported by pts at the pretreatment interview were remission (40.7%), extended life expectancy (14.8%), less treatment (11.1%), and cure (11.1%). The most frequently reported treatment hopes were remission (40.7%), return to perceived normalcy (25.9%), cure (25.9%), and extended life expectancy (22.2%). Key areas in which pts would consider changes to be meaningful with cilta-cel treatment were improved MM symptoms (70.4%), return to perceived normalcy (40.7%), and the ability to be more physically active (33.3%). At Day 100 and 184 interviews, respectively, 78.3% and 91.7% of pts reported that their expectations of cilta-cel were met or exceeded ( Figure A ). Furthermore, most pts at the Day 100 and 184 interviews (52.2% and 70.8%, respectively) perceived their experience with cilta-cel as exclusively better than their previous treatment experiences ( Figure B ). Conclusions: Pts treated with cilta-cel experienced reductions in both symptoms associated with R/R MM and impact of MM on HRQoL. Pretreatment expectations of cilta-cel were met or exceeded, and most pts reported their experience was better than with prior MM treatments.
