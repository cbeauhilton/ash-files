Hematological malignancies account for about 15% of all the cancers diagnosed in this group. The aim of this study is to analyze epidemiologic and survival parameters of common hematological malignancies in AIP living in the USA and compare it to the US White (USW) population for the first time. Methods: The SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End results) database has been reporting cancer incidence since 1973. AIP with cancer diagnosis was reported separately under race and ethnicity in SEER database from 1988. Using SEER database 1988-2006, appropriate frequency and survival sessions (Kaplan-Meier survival method) were performed and epidemiologic characteristics for common hematological malignancies were compared between AIP and USW.

The distribution of these malignancies according to gender follows other major groups but there is no statistical difference in age at diagnosis, stages, tumor biology, treatment methodologies or survival between male and female AIP. Noticeable better 1-5 years survival could be attributed to difference in tumor biology, cytogenetics, emigrational factors, higher socioeconomic status, better access to health care, educational background with awareness and environmental factors. Future studies are warranted to examine the behavior and biology of tumor in this population. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
