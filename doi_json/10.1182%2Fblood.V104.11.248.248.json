    "abstract_text": "We have developed, characterized, and validated a new genetic stock of IL-2r common \u03b3 (gamma) chain deficient NOD/LtSz- scid (NOD- scid IL2r \u03b3 null ) mice that support high levels of human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment and multilineage differentiation. Histology, flow cytometry, and functional assays document a severe depletion of lymphocytes and NK cells in NOD- scid IL2r \u03b3 null mice. These mice survive beyond 16 months of age and untreated as well as sub-lethally irradiated NOD- scid IL2r \u03b3 null mice are resistant to the development of lymphomas and are \u201cnon-leaky\u201d throughout life. Intravenous injection of sub-lethally irradiated NOD- scid IL2r \u03b3 null mice with 7 x 10 5 human mobilized CD34 + stem cells leads to high levels of multilineage engraftment. At 10 weeks after engraftment, percentages of human hematopoietic CD45 + cells are six-fold higher in the bone marrow of NOD- scid IL2r \u03b3 null mice as compared to NOD- scid controls. Human CD45 + cells include immature and mature B cells, NK cells, myeloid cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells and HSCs. Spleens from engrafted NOD- scid IL2r \u03b3 null mice contain high percentages of immature and mature B cells but low percentages of T cells. Treatment with human Fc-IL7 fusion protein leads to a high percentage of human CD4 + CD8 + immature thymocytes and high percentages of CD4 + CD8 \u2212 and CD4 \u2212 CD8 + mature human T cells in the spleen and blood. Validation of de novo human T cell development was carried out by quantifying T cell receptor excision circles in thymocytes and by analyses of TCR\u03b2 repertoire diversity. Human T cell function was evidenced by proliferative responses to PHA and streptococcal superantigen. NOD- scid IL2r \u03b3 null mice engrafted with human HSC generate differentiated functional human T and B cells and provide an in vivo model of multilineage human hematopoietic cell engraftment."
