    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is characterized by arterial or venous thrombosis, and/or adverse obstetric outcomes in the presence of persistent antiphospholipid antibodies (APab). Between 2\u201310% of all patients with APS are reported to present solely with anti beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies (b2GP1 abs) (ref 1 ). In 2006 the Sapporo criteria were revised to include b2GP1 abs to the panel of diagnostic tests. While presence of a lupus anticoagulant (LA) has been found to correlate well with occurrence of thromboses, the prognostic and predictive roles of b2GP1 abs and anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLA) need better definition. Previous studies suggest both the severity of the initial event and the risk for recurrent events is greater among patients demonstrating presence of more than one APab on laboratory testing (ref 2 and 3 ), but this aspect needs further confirmation. Objectives: To identify the spectrum of clinical thrombotic and obstetric manifestations associated with the different APab profiles; To determine the prevalence and clinical significance of the b2GP1 ab positive and ACLA/LA negative phenotype; and To evaluate the significance of IgM b2GP1 ab and IgM ACLA. Methods: Medical records of patients tested for all three antiphospholipid antibodies at the University of Minnesota Medical Center from Dec 2000 to Dec 2005 were reviewed. Patients that met the modified criteria for APS were included. IgG and IgM ACLA were measured using the Diamedix kit (VAX diagnostics) and IgG and IgM b2GP1 abs using the Inovalite kit (NOVA diagnostics). LA was determined using standard protocol. Results: Over the 5 year period, all three laboratory assays were obtained in 560 individuals, but only 76 (13.5%) patients who met both the clinical and laboratory criteria for APS were included in this study. Seven of the 76 patients (9.2%) had isolated, persistently positive b2GP1 abs. LA alone was present in 21 patients (27.6%). Twenty nine patients (38%) had all three APabs, and had a higher incidence of thrombosis at multiple sites at the time of diagnosis as well as increased rate of recurrent events, in comparison to those with two or less than two APab. Isolated ACLA was present in only 2 patients (2.6%). Interestingly, both IgM (47%) and IgG (50%) b2GP1 abs were associated with thrombosis, whereas only IgG ACLA was found to be associated with thrombosis. Conclusion: The presence of b2GP1 abs as the sole laboratory anomaly is uncommon, but is noted in patients with APS, thus warranting it\u2019s testing at the time of clinical suspicion. Amongst the different antibody types LA seems to be the strongest predictor for thrombotic events and ACLA seems to have a weaker link, consistent with the results of previous studies (ref 4 ). The presence of all three AP antibodies does increase the risk for recurrent and multiple thromboses.",
