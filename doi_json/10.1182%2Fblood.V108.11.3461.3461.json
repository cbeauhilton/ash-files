    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been validated as a therapeutic target with the approval of the small molecule proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib (VELCADE \u00ae ), in multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, the overall response rate of patients with multiple myeloma in phase III clinical trials was 43%, underscoring the need for a next generation of inhibitors with the potential for greater efficacy. Methods: PR-171 is a novel, tetrapeptide epoxomicin-related inhibitor that binds the proteasome irreversibly, and our objectives were to evaluate its activity and mechanism of action in pre-clinical models of multiple myeloma. Results: PR-171 potently bound and inhibited the chymotrypsin-like subunit of the proteasome in vitro , in cellulo , and in vivo at low concentrations. At higher concentrations, however, unlike bortezomib, which targeted the chymotrypsin-like and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide hydrolyzing activities in vivo , PR-171 also displayed significant inhibition of the trypsin-like and the peptidyl-glutamyl peptide hydrolyzing activities. PR-171-induced proteasome inhibition was associated with accumulation of polyubiquitinated substrates and pro-apoptotic Bax. Brief pulse PR-171 exposure, which simulates the in vivo pharmacokinetics of bortezomib, led to PR-171-mediated inhibition of cellular proliferation linked to induction of caspase-3-dependent apoptosis through both intrinsic (caspase-9) and extrinsic (caspase-8-dependent) pathways. Pretreatment with caspase-3, -8, and -9 inhibitors rescued the anti-proliferative effect of PR-171. Furthermore, pulse PR-171 treatment activated c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, a key-signaling molecule in proteasome inhibitor-induced apoptosis, and cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, while abrogation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase signaling with a dominant-negative c-Jun inhibited PR-171-induced effects. PR-171 displayed enhanced anti-proliferative activity compared to bortezomib in multiple myeloma cell lines and freshly isolated patient-derived CD138 + plasma cells, associated with enhanced phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase and capase-3, -8, and -9 activation. Lastly, PR-171 was a potent inhibitor of proliferation in a multiple myeloma cell line model resistant to bortezomib and in isolates from two patients, one with primary and the other with acquired bortezomib-resistance. Conclusions: These data indicate that PR-171 has enhanced activity against preclinical models of multiple myeloma, perhaps owing to its irreversible binding and subunit specificity, and provide a rationale for its translation into the clinic.",
