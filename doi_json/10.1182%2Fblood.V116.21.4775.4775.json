    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4775 Background: Based on promising experimental studies with mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPCs) multiple clinical trials have been initiated. In previous studies we have observed genomic stability of MSPCs after efficient short-term expansion in a humanized GMP compliant system with pooled human platelet lysate (pHPL) replacing fetal bovine serum (FBS) as the cell culture supplement (Schallmoser K. and Strunk D., Journal of Visualized Experiments (32) DOI: 10.3791/1523, 2009). Notably, depending on culture protocols, an extensive propagation with highly variable cell culture duration may be necessary to yield enough MSPCs for therapy. The decline in proliferation rates of MSPCs in the course of the different long-term expansion procedures may indicate a propensity for replicative senescence which may hamper long term functionality in vivo . We have therefore initiated a molecular profiling of senescence-associated regulated genes to determine the state of senescence before MSPC transplantation. Methods: Human bone marrow-derived MSPCs were cultured following a highly efficient two-passage protocol (primary culture of unseparated bone marrow and subsequent large scale expansion; Schallmoser K. et al., Tissue Engineering 14:185-196, 2008) compared to conventional serial passaging in three different growth conditions with regularly more then four passages to obtain comparable final cell numbers. Culture media were either supplemented with FBS in different concentrations or pHPL. Gene expression changes were tested by microarray analysis and selected targets were reanalyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The genomic stability of MSPCs after long-term culture was determined by array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Results: Despite high proliferation rate large scale expanded MSPCs showed genomic stability in array CGH. Long-term MSPC growth induced similar gene expression changes in MSPCs irrespective of isolation and expansion conditions. In particular, genes involved in cell differentiation, apoptosis and cell death were up-regulated, whereas genes involved in mitosis and proliferation were down-regulated. Furthermore, overlapping senescence-associated gene expression changes were found in all MSPC preparations. The genomic copy number variations detected in MSPCs of early and late passages in all culture conditions did not coincide with differentially expressed genes. Conclusion: Our data indicate that MSPC expansion can induce gene expression changes independent of isolation and FBS-supplemented as well as FBS-free expansion conditions. A panel of genes will be presented that might offer a practicable approach to assess MSPC quality with regard to the state of replicative senescence in advance of therapeutic application. Determining the impact of senescence acquired during cell expansion on the therapeutic potential of MSCPs for both immune modulation and organ regeneration may help to develop more efficient treatment strategies.
