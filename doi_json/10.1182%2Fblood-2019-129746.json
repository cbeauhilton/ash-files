    "abstract_text": "Background: Chemotherapy-refractory or recurrent B-lineage leukemias and lymphomas yield less than 50% of chance of cure. Therapy with autologous T-cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) have led to complete remissions, but the effector cells may not persist, limiting clinical efficacy. Our hypothesis is the modification of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with anti-CD19 CAR will lead to persistent generation of multilineage target-specific immune cells, enhancing graft-versus-cancer activity and leading to development of immunological memory. Design/Methods: We generated second-generation CD28- and 4-1BB-costimulated CD19-specific CAR constructs using third-generation lentiviral vectors for modification of human HSC for assessment in vivo in NSG mice engrafted neonatally with human CD34-positive cells. Cells were harvested from bone marrows, spleens, thymus and peripheral blood at different time points for evaluation by flow cytometry and ddPCR for vector copy numbers. Cohorts of mice received tumor challenge with subcutaneous injection of lymphoma cell lines. Results: Gene modification of HSC with CD19-specific CAR did not impair differentiation or proliferation in humanized mice, leading to CAR-expressing cell progeny in myeloid, NK and T-cells. Humanized NSG engrafted with CAR-modified HSC presented similar humanization rates to non-modified HSC, with multilineage CAR-expressing cells present in all tissues with stable levels up to 44 weeks post-transplant. No animals engrafted with CAR-modified HSC presented autoimmunity or inflammation. T-cell populations were identified at higher rates in humanized mice with CAR-modified HSC in comparison to mice engrafted with non-modified HSC. CAR-modified HSC led to development of T-cell effector memory and T-cell central memory phenotypes, confirming the development of long-lasting phenotypes due to directed antigen specificity. Mice engrafted with CAR-modified HSC successfully presented tumor growth inhibition and survival advantage at tumor challenge with lymphoma cell lines, with no difference between both constructs (62.5% survival for CD28-costimulated CAR and 66.6% for 41BB-costimulated CAR). In mice sacrificed due to tumor development, survival post-tumor injection was directly correlated with tumor infiltration by CAR T-cells. Conclusions: CAR modification of human HSC for cancer immunotherapy is feasible and continuously generates CAR-bearing cells in multiple lineages of immune cells. Targeting of different malignancies can be achieved by adjusting target specificity, and this approach can augment the anti-lymphoma activity in autologous HSC recipients. It bears decreased morbidity and mortality and offers alternative therapeutic approach for patients with no available sources for allogeneic transplantation, benefiting ethnic minorities.
