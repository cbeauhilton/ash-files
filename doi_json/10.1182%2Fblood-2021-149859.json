    "abstract_text": "Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CART19) cell therapy has resulted in unprecedented outcomes in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies, which led to the FDA approval for several indications. However, CART19 cell therapy is limited by the development of severe life-threatening toxicities, as well as by the limited rates of durable response. It has become apparent that myeloid cells contribute to the development of both CART cell toxicity and also to the inhibitory tumor microenvironment. We and others have identified that granulocyte-monocyte-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) depletion results in decreased myeloid activation, reduced toxicities, and enhancement of CART19 cell therapy efficacy in pre-clinical models. Furthermore, we observed that GM-CSF knockout (GM-CSF k/o ) in CART19 cells resulted in the improvement of their functions ( in vitro and in vivo ). These findings suggest that there is also a direct effect of GM-CSF on CART19 cells, which is independent of the GM-CSF impact on myeloid cell activation. To further evaluate this, we first examined GM-CSF receptor alpha (GM-CSFR\u03b1) expression by flow cytometry on resting and activated CART19 cells (using FMC63-41BB\u03b6). When CART19 cells were stimulated with either anti-CD3/CD28 beads or lethally irradiated (120 Gy) CD19 + Nalm6 cells (B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cancer cell line), GM-CSFR\u03b1 expression was upregulated upon both T cell receptor (TCR) (data not shown) and CAR stimulation (Figure 1A). Having demonstrated that GM-CSFR\u03b1 is significantly upregulated on stimulated CART19 cells, we aimed to determine the impact of GM-CSF neutralization (clinical-grade anti-GM-CSF antibody, lenzilumab, 10 \u00b5g/mL) versus GM-CSFR\u03b1 blockade (research-grade antibody, 10 \u00b5g/mL) on CART19 cell function and CART cell-monocyte interactions. An IgG isotype antibody was used as a control antibody. Neither the GM-CSF neutralizing antibody, nor GM-CSFR\u03b1 blocking antibody, had any impact on CART19 cell antigen-specific killing against the CD19 + JeKo-1 cells (mantle cell lymphoma cancer cell line), in the presence or absence of CD14 + monocytes (ratio 1:1:1) isolated by magnetic beads from healthy donors (Figures 1B-C). Next, we compared the effects of GM-CSF neutralization versus GM-CSFR\u03b1 blockade on CART19 cell antigen-specific proliferation. Here, CART19 cells were co-cultured with lethally irradiated CD19 + cell line JeKo-1 at 1:1 ratio in the presence of 10 \u00b5g/mL of the GM-CSF neutralizing antibody, increasing doses of the GM-CSFR\u03b1 blocking antibody (10-100 \u00b5g/mL), or an IgG control. The absolute number of CART cells was measured by flow cytometry on day 5. GM-CSF neutralization did not affect CART19 cell proliferation, but GM-CSFR\u03b1 blocking antibody significantly inhibited CART19 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Then, we assessed the effects of GM-CSF neutralizing antibody (20 \u00b5g/mL) versus GM-CSFR\u03b1 blocking antibody (20 \u00b5g/mL) on CART19 cell antigen-specific proliferation in the presence of healthy donor monocytes (ratio 1:1:0.5) on day 3. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that GM-CSF neutralization, but not GM-CSFR\u03b1 blockade, mitigated monocyte-suppression of CART19 antigen-specific proliferation (Figure 1E). In summary, our findings indicate significant differences on CART cell functions and CART cell-monocyte interactions when a specific cytokine, GM-CSF, is neutralized compared to blocking its receptor. Further mechanistic studies are ongoing to assess the functions of GM-CSFR\u03b1 k/o and GM-CSF k/o CART cells.
