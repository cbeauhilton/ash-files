    "article_date": "November 16, 2004",

    "abstract_text": "We report a technological approach permitting, for the first time, the massive (up to 2x10 6 -fold cell expansion) and selective (100%) ex vivo production of mature RBCs (cRBCs) starting from CD 34 + cells from peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM) or cord blood (CB) into mature red cells in three steps: firstly, cell proliferation and erythroid differentiation were induced in serum free media supplemented with SCF, IL-3 and Epo for 8 days. Secondly, cells were co-cultured with additional Epo alone on either the murine MS-5 stromal cell line or human mesenchymal cells for 3 days. In the third step, all exogenous factors were withdrawn and cells were incubated on a simple stroma for 4 to 10 days. These cultured erythroid cells (reticulocytes and mature RBCs) displayed characteristics identical to those of native cells, in terms of MCV, MCH, MCHC, enzyme content (G6PD and PK) and deformability. The nature of the Hb produced depended on both the origin of the CD34 + cells and the culture conditions. cRBCs derived from PB or adult BM contained adult Hb (95\u00b11%) whereas cRBCs derived from CB contained essentially HbF (64\u00b113%). As for native RBCs, Hb was able to fix and release oxygen. CFSE-labelled-reticulocytes ex vivo generated from leukapheresis were injected into NOD-SCID mice. The transfused reticulocytes were found in the circulation to the same extent as native RBCs and fully matured into RBCs. This methodology is applicable for fundamental analysis of the mechanisms of terminal erythropoiesis and hemoglobin synthesis. Moreover, large scale cRBCs production could be possible with such a protocol. It can therefore be extrapolated to a wide range of clinical applications in the field of gene therapy, infectious diseases and particularly transfusion medicine with a pointed interest for the generation of a cell population homogeneous in age, thus achieving the new concept of cultured RBCs transfusion.",
