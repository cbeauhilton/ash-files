    "abstract_text": "Background IL-6 receptor/JAK/STAT is a major signalling pathway associated with pleiotropic functions including cell transformation and proliferation. STAT3, one of a family of 7 STAT members, sits at the apex of the signalling cascade and is a potential target for cancer therapy. Small molecular weight inhibitors either prevent STAT3 phosphorylation or target high constitutive levels of phosphorylated pSTAT3 (pSTAT3). Increased constitutive expression of pSTAT3 is a hallmark of solid tumors and is associated with increased morbidity. However recent studies suggest that this may not apply to hematological malignancies. Phospho-flow cytometry offers a novel approach for the quantitation of constitutive and cytokine induced pSTAT3 expression in subsets of hemopoietic cells. Constitutive pSTAT3 expression is not a prognostic factor for patients with either multiple myeloma (MM) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), though we recently demonstrated that IL-6 induced pSTAT3 was associated with better prognosis in MM (\u03c7 2 =13.06; p<0.0003) (Leukemia 2015; 29:483) . There is considerable heterogeneity of pSTAT3 expression between patients which suggests that quantitation of these new biomarkers may help to identify those patients most likely to respond to STAT-targeted therapy. Methods We have determined constitutive and IL-6 induced pSTAT3 and 5 in malignant plasma cells of patients with MM (n=25) and for comparison, the blast cells in AML (n=8) and CD5+ B cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n=12) as well as the non-malignant B and T cells in each sample. Normal BM cells (n=9) served as a control. We have also determined pSTAT3 and 5 expression in \"side population\" cells (SP), the putative myeloma stem cells, and determined whether MM and AML tumor cells induce pSTAT3 on normal lymphocytes in vitro by co-culture experiments. IL-6 receptor expression was also determined on all cells. Results Constitutive pSTAT3 expression was increased (>5% of normal lymphocytes) in the malignant plasma cells of 44% of patients with MM but by comparison was not increased in AML or B-CLL. Constitutive pSTAT5 was increased (>5%) in 68% of MM plasma cells and 75% of AML cells and was either normal or decreased in CLL cells. Patients with increased pSTAT3 or 5 in MM cells also had high expression in autologous normal T cells. The level of constitutive pSTAT3 and 5 was not related to the disease status (relapse vs remission). In patients with MM, IL-6 induced an increased pSTAT3 expression (induced/constitutive ratio >1.5) in both MM cells and T cells in 88% of samples. IL-6 induced pSTAT3 expression in blasts of 89% of AML patients (median ratio = 79). There was no correlation between the level of pSTAT3 induced by IL-6 and IL-6 receptor expression. IL-6 did not increase pSTAT5 levels in MM, AML or CLL. SP cells in the MM cell line RPMI 8226 had lower constitutive pSTAT3 than the non-SP population and a lower IL-6 receptor expression, but had a greater response to cytokine stimulation, suggesting that SP cells may be more sensitive than non-SP cells to inhibitors of STAT phosphorylation. Addition of RPMI 8226 cells or supernatant to normal T cells caused an increase in pSTAT3, suggesting that the upregulation of pSTAT3 is at least partly due to a tumor-derived soluble agent in the microenvironment. Conclusions These results demonstrate the heterogeneity of constitutive and cytokine induced pSTAT3 and 5 expression in MM, AML and CLL. Elevated levels of constitutive pSTAT3 (approx 44% of MM) and pSTAT5 (88% of MM and AML) in the malignant clone were associated with high levels in autologous non-malignant T cells and are not of prognostic significance. Therefore elevated pSTAT3 and 5 may not be an exclusive hallmark of the malignant clone, as reported in solid tumors, but rather a result of the microenvironment and a high IL6-R expression. Phospho-flow cytometry enables precise quantitation of constitutive and cytokine-induced pSTAT3 and 5, and thus can identify the patients most likely to respond to direct STAT-3 or 5 inhibitor therapies. SP cells (putative MM stem cells) appear to be potentially targetable. Inhibitors targeting signalling pathways may be more efficacious if therapy is directed to patients with targetable checkpoints.
