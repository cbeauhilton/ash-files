    "abstract_text": "Abstract 912 Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are thought to be localized in hypoxic microenvironment of the bone marrow (BM) and can remain quiescent or differentiate into multiple blood cell lineages. A number of factors have been found to regulate HSC quiescence in either cell-intrinsic or cell-extrinsic manner. Cited2 (CBP/p300-interacting transactivators with glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D)-rich tail 2), a member of a newly identified transcriptional modulator, is a cytokine inducible gene and plays various roles during mouse development. In particular, Cited2 is essential for fetal liver hematopoiesis. In this study, we used conditional knockout strategy to delete Cited2 in order to further investigate its function in adult hematopoiesis. Sequential injection of poly(I)-poly(C) (pI-pC) efficiently deleted the Cited2 gene in Cited2 fl/fl ;Mx1-Cre mice. In this mouse model (Cited2 \u2212/\u2212 mice), the white blood cell (WBC) count, BM cellularity and Lin \u2212 Sca-1 + c-Kit + (LSK) cell number were within the normal range. However, the long-term HSC (LT-HSC; defined as Flt3 \u2212 CD34 \u2212 LSK or CD48 \u2212 CD150 + LSK) frequency was significantly decreased. Cited2 \u2212/\u2212 mice also exhibited increased apoptosis in both LSK and CD34 \u2212 LSK cells. In addition, Cited2 deficiency led to loss of HSC quiescence evidenced by cell cycle analysis and BrdU incorporation assay. HSC reconstitution capacity was significantly impaired assessed by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment and transplantation experiments. Transcriptional profiling revealed that multiple HSC quiescence and hypoxia related genes were affected, including p57, Hes1 and Egr1. Recent studies have shown that both HIF-1\u03b1-deficient and HIF-1\u03b1-stabilized HSCs result in impaired hematopoietic reconstitution, suggesting that precise regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 level is essential for maintaining HSC quiescence and transplantation activity. Cited2 has been shown to be a negative regulator for HIF-1\u03b1 through competitive binding to CBP/p300 with higher affinity. In addition, we previously showed that HIF-1\u03b1 haploinsufficiency (HIF-1\u03b1 +/\u2212 ) partially rescues the heart defects in Cited2 \u2212/\u2212 embryos and HIF-1\u03b1 deletion (HIF-1\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 ) rescues aberrant vasculature in Cited2 \u2212/\u2212 embryonic lens. These findings prompted us to explore whether defects of Cited2 \u2212/\u2212 HSC in adult mice are mediated by dysregulated HIF-1 activity by generating Cited2 fl/fl HIF-1\u03b1 fl/fl ;Mx1-Cre mice. Additional deletion of HIF-1\u03b1 partially rescued impaired HSC quiescence and reconstitution capacity caused by Cited2 deficiency. Cited2 \u2212/\u2212 HIF-1\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 HSCs displayed comparable apoptosis to Cited2 \u2212/\u2212 counterparts. At the transcriptional level, deletion of HIF-1\u03b1 restored expression of p57 and Hes1 but not Egr1 to a normal level. Taken together, these results suggest that Cited2 regulates HSC quiescence through HIF-1 dependent and independent pathways. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
