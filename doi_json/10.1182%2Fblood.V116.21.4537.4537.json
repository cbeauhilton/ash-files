    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4537 INTRODUCTION. Autologous HSCT is currently under investigation for the treatment of refractory, progressive MS. A better selection of patients and the use of less aggressive regimens resulted in a significant drop of Transplant-related Mortality (TRM), which is mostly related to immunosuppression. CMV and EBV tend to reactivate in ATG-treated allogeneic HSCT. We investigated the frequency of CMV/EBV viral load in a consecutive cohort of MS patients who underwent HSCT in our Center following BEAM and Anti-T Lymphocyte Globulin (ATG) conditioning regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Thirty-one patients underwent auto-HSCT for severe MS in our Institution from 1999 to 2010. All patients were mobilized by Cyclophosphamide 4 g/sqm + G-CSF and conditioned with BEAM plus rabbit ATG (Thymoglobulin\u00a9) at a dose ranging between 7.5 and 10 mg/Kg. Monitoring of CMV/EBV DNA by quantitative PCR on either circulating Mononuclear Cells (MNC) or Whole Blood (WB) was performed in 29 pts. In 18 patients \u22652 tests were available for both CMV and EBV from +20 and +120 days. In 2006, following a case of severe CMV infection, a specific protocol was developed, aimed at monitoring on a weekly basis the viral load in case reactivation until complete negativisation. Pre-emptive treatment was administered in case of viral DNA load >1\u00d710 3 copies/10 5 MNC or >1\u00d710 4 4 copies/ml WB in two subsequent determinations. RESULTS. Overall 84 and 95 tests were carried out for CMV and EBV, respectively. 10/29 patients (34.5%) were shown positive for CMV at a median of 33,5 days from HSCT (28-47), whereas 11/29 patients (37.9%) were positive for EBV at a median of 29 days from HSCT (20-109). Five patients resulted positive for both viruses. According to the ongoing protocols, 20% of CMV+ patients and 18% of EBV+ patients received a pre-emptive treatment with a fast drop of viral load. In the other patients the reactivation was self-limiting in 2\u20133 weeks from the first positive determination. One patient developed a severe CMV infection at + 47 days successfully treated the iv administration of Gancyclovir and Foscarnet. One EBV+ patient developed fever which responded promptly after treatment with rituximab. Moreover, in 16/29 patients a sporadic assessment of CMV/EBV was performed at early (between +5 and + 20) and late phases (beyond 120 days) without any evidence of viral reactivation. CONCLUSIONS. Autologous HSCT with BEAM/ATG can be safely performed in MS patients. A significant reactivation of both CMV and EBV can occur in the 3 months following HSCT, possibly related to the ATG administration. Monitoring of viral load and, whenever necessary, pre-emptive anti-viral treatment should be performed in order to improve safety of HSCT in this subset of non-neoplastic patients.
