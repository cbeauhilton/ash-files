    "abstract_text": "Clinical observations and experimental evidence link bone marrow failure in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with a T cell-dominated immunologically-mediated pathophysiology in some patients. Indeed, among 129 patients treated with immunosuppression at NIH, trisomy 8 was associated with hematologic response to immunosuppression. We have demonstrated that trisomy 8 patients have oligoclonal CD8 T cell expansion, as determined by increased proportions of one or more T cell receptor (TCR) V beta subfamilies ( Sloand et al. Blood  106 : 841 ; 2005 ) which had cytotoxic activity toward trisomy 8 cell progenitors. Here we examine the response of cytotoxic T cells to cyclin D1 and Wilms tumor protein (WT-1); these candidate autoantigens had earlier been observed to be over-expressed in trisomy 8 CD34 cell in our microarray analysis (Chen et al. Blood 104:4210, 2004 ). Bone marrow mononuclear cells from 19 trisomy 8 patients (defined by cytogenetics and FISH) had significantly increased levels of WT-1 mRNA and protein expression compared to normal CD34 cells by real time PCR and immunoblot, respectively (p<0.001). When patient and control CD8 cells were cultured in the presence of WT-1- and cyclin D1-loaded HLA-A2-restricted antigen-presenting cells (using three different HLA-A0201- restricted epitopes of WT-1 and four different epitopes for CD1), eight patients\u2019 CD8 cell tested positive for interferon gamma, indicating a cytotoxic response. Staining with labeled MHC class I A2-restricted tetramers used to measure WT-1-specific cells showed concordant results in all eight patients. Tetramer staining was increased in 12 of 14 trisomy 8 patients examined. Cytotoxic T cells specific for WT-1 were present within the expanded V \u03b2 subfamilies previously found to suppress trisomy 8 cell proliferation in vitro. CD8 cells from another eight MDS patients without trisomy 8 but who had responded to immunosuppression, sampled prior to treatment, also demonstrated WT1-specific cytotoxic activity, but only two of 18 non-responders showed measurable levels of WT-1-specific cytotoxic T cells (entire treated cohort seen in Fig 1). We infer from these data an autoimmune pathophysiology for trisomy 8 MDS with: 1) over-expression of WT-1 by the aneuploid clone; 2) a specific cytotoxic CD8 T cell immune response to WT-1; 3) subsequent cytotoxic T cell marrow suppression by apoptosis, either by cross reactivity or a bystander effect; and 4) improvement in hematopoiesis after immunosuppression. Other MDS which is responsive to immunosuppression may also be mediated by WT1. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure  Close modal",
