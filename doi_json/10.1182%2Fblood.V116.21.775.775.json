    "abstract_text": "Abstract 775 We have shown ( Oaks JJ et al. ASH 2009 ) that the tumor suppressor Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is functionally inactivated by Jak2 V617F in cell line models of Jak2 V617F myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) and Jak2 V617F -transduced primary mouse bone marrow cells. Inhibition of Jak2 (600 nM Jak Inhibitor I; 50 \u03bcM AG490; 10h) or treatment with the PP2A activator FTY720 (2.5\u03bcM, 24 hours) restored PP2A activity that caused loss of Jak2 V617F protein/activity, impaired Jak2 V617F -driven colony formation, and induced apoptosis of Jak2 V617F+ but not normal myeloid cells. Notably, FTY720 is a sphingosine analog suggested by the FDA to treat patients with Multiple Sclerosis due to its immunosuppressive activity when phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2). Here we show that FTY720 treatment of CD34 + primary bone marrow cells from Jak V617F+ PV patients (n=3) also rescued PP2A activity, induced Jak2 downregulation and significantly impaired cytokine-dependent clonogenic potential. Thus, FTY720 could be used as an alternative to Jak2 inhibitors, as in vitro and in animal assays showed that FTY720 (2.5\u03bcM) is not toxic against normal human myeloid progenitors while decreasing survival of CD34+ progenitors from MPD patients. To find out whether FTY720 uses the same mechanism to exert its immunosuppressive and anti-leukemic activities, we determined if the conversion of FTY720 into its phosphorylated form is important for rescuing PP2A activity in Jak2 V617F -expressing cells. Impaired FTY720-P conversion by exposure to the SPHK inhibitor dimethylsphingosine (2.5\u03bcM, 6 hours) did not affect the ability of FTY720 to activate PP2A. Also, a synthetically phosphorylated FTY720 (FTY720-P, 2.5\u03bcM, 6 hours) was unable to activate PP2A or exert any anti-leukemic activity, suggesting that the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of FTY720 are independent of its phosphorylation and interaction with the S1PR1 receptor. We found that activation of S1PR1 through the specific agonist SEW2871 (10\u03bcM), FTY720-P (2.5\u03bcM), or sphingosine-1-phosphate (100nM) markedly suppresses (~60% inhibition) rather than activates PP2A in normal myeloid progenitors. As expected, knockdown of S1PR1 had no effect on FTY720-mediated PP2A activation in Jak2 V617F -transformed cells. Mechanistically we found that Jak2 V617F and PP2Ac were found in a ternary complex with the PP2A inhibitor SET. SET knockdown by shRNA restored PP2A activity in Jak2 V617F+ Ba/F3 cells to levels similar to those found in non-transformed cells, and led to an 84% decrease in Jak2 V617F+ -driven colony formation. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that FTY720 (10\u03bcM) disrupts Jak2-PP2A, PP2A-SET and Jak2-SET interactions, suggesting that SET may be the target of FTY720. Consistently, affinity chromatography showed that FTY720 efficiently interferes with the ability of C6-ceramide (10\u03bcM) to bind SET as the amount of SET eluted from the biotin-labeled C6-ceramide was significantly reduced by exposure of the cell lysate to FTY720. As well, lentiviral-mediated expression of wild type or K209D SET mutant (ceramide binding deficient) in Ba/F3 cells impaired PP2A activity (\u226580% decrease), which could be totally rescued by FTY720 only in cells transduced with wild type but not K209D SET. The formal demonstration that FTY720 activates PP2A by displacing SET came when we found SET in anti-NBD immunoprecipitates from Jak2 V617F -expressing Ba/F3 cells treated with FTY720-phenoxy-NBD (10\u03bcM; 30 min). Together, our data show that FTY720 has the potential to be an effective therapeutic agent for MPD patients by virtue of its low toxicity and ability to activate PP2A by displacing SET; however, FTY720 still retains the ability to become phosphorylated and inhibit, at least in part, PP2A. Thus, we developed non-phosphorylatable FTY720 derivatives and assessed them for their ability to: activate PP2A; induce downregulation/inactivation of targeted kinases (e.g. Jak2, BCR-ABL1, Akt); act as anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic agent to leukemic but not normal myeloid/lymphoid progenitors; do not interact with S1PR1; and show no in vivo effects on B220+/CD19+ and CD4 or CD8 cellular compartments. These FTY720 derivatives were found to be not immunosuppressive but able to mirror FTY720 in terms of inducing Jak2 V617F downregulation and cell killing while retaining the parent compound's minimal toxicity towards untransformed cells.
