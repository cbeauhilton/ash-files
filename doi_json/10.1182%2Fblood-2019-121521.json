    "abstract_text": "Background : DLBCL is an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with poor outcomes in the R/R setting; overall survival (OS) is 28% at 1 year and 20% at 2 years in refractory patients (Crump, Blood 2017). Outcomes are particularly poor for patients ineligible for stem cell transplant (SCT). Ibrutinib is the only once-daily inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase and is approved for the treatment of various B-cell malignancies. Based on preclinical models, ibrutinib and lenalidomide, an immunomodulator that downregulates the MYD88 pathway, may synergize when combined (Yang, Cancer Cell 2012). Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, has shown activity combined with ibrutinib in NHL (Wang, Lancet Onc 2016). PCYC-1123 is a multicenter, open-label phase 1b/2 study (NCT02077166) evaluating the combination of ibrutinib, lenalidomide, and rituximab (iR 2 ) in R/R DLBCL. Methods : Patients \u226518 years of age with R/R non-GCB DLBCL ineligible for SCT received lenalidomide 20 or 25 mg orally on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle plus ibrutinib 560 mg orally once daily and rituximab 375 mg/m 2 IV on Day 1 of Cycle 1-6. Treatment was continued until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed by central laboratory per the Hans algorithm. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints were complete response (CR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), OS, and safety. Response was determined by investigator assessment per Cheson ( J Clin Oncol 2014) every 3 treatment cycles for the first 24 months (mos) and then every 6 cycles thereafter. Results: In total, 89 patients were enrolled and treated in phase 2 (n=55 and n=34 in the lenalidomide 20 mg and 25 mg cohorts, respectively). The median patient age was 64 years; 58% were male. At study entry, 53% of patients were refractory to their last therapy and 16% were primary refractory, 47% had relapsed, and 63% had stage IV disease. Median number of prior DLBCL therapies was 2 (range 1-5), with the most common being R-CHOP (73%), RICE (26%), and R-DHAP (13%). Twenty patients had prior SCT. All patients were non-GCB by IHC; for the 47 patients with tumor tissue available for nanostring testing by GEP, there was 84% concordance in non-GCB status (activated B-cell [ABC] or unclassified). The median time on study was 16 mos (range <1-28 mos); 20 patients (22%) and 4 patients (4%) received iR 2 treatment for \u22651 and \u22652 years, respectively, with 25 patients (28%) receiving iR 2 treatment at the time of the analysis. The median time to response was 2.7 mos. Of the 85 response-evaluable patients with follow-up response assessment, the ORR was 47% (95% CI 36-58), including 28% with CR and 19% with partial response; 16% had stable disease. The median DOR (n=40) was 18 mos (range <1-22 mos) overall and in the 20 mg cohort and was not reached (NR) in the 25 mg cohort. For patients with CR, the median DOR was NR. Estimated PFS was 31% (95% CI 21-41) at 18 mos, and median PFS was 5 mos (95% CI 3-6). Estimated OS was 44% (95% CI 32-56) at 18 mos, and median OS was 14 mos (95% CI 10 mos-not estimable [NE]) ( Figure 1A ). For the 40 responders, median PFS was 21 mos (95% CI 11-NE), and median OS was NR (95% CI 18 mos-NE). 14 patients (16%) were in CR for >1 year ( Figure 1B ). The most common adverse events (occurring in >30% of patients) were diarrhea (53%), fatigue (42%), neutropenia (40%), cough (34%), anemia (33%), peripheral edema (33%), and maculopapular rash (31%). The most common Grade 3/4 AEs were neutropenia (36%) and maculopapular rash (18%); Grade 3/4 atrial fibrillation occurred in 2% of patients. Grade 5 TEAEs occurred in 12 patients; of these, 7 were due to worsening of DLBCL, and 5 were not related to PD (pneumonia [n=3], sepsis [n=1], and cardiac arrest [n=1]). AEs led to discontinuation in 17% of patients (n=15) overall (those occurring in \u22652 patients were worsening of DLBCL [n=4], pneumonia [n=2], and thrombocytopenia [n=2]). Conclusions : The iR 2 combination of ibrutinib, lenalidomide, and rituximab showed an ORR of 47% in patients with follow-up response assessment, with 28% CRs, including durable CRs of up to 22 mos. The safety profile was manageable in this phase 2 study of patients with R/R non-GCB DLBCL ineligible for SCT. Further evaluation of the iR 2 regimen is ongoing.
