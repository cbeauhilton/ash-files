    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-32 TET family enzymes convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in DNA. Somatic TET2 mutations are frequently observed in myeloid neoplasms in humans. Bone marrow samples from patients with mutant TET2 , as well as some patients with wild type TET2 , display low levels of 5hmC in genomic DNA compared to healthy controls. Measurement of 5hmC levels in myeloid malignancies may prove valuable as a diagnostic and prognostic tool to tailor therapies and assess responses to anticancer drugs. We have developed novel and specific approaches to profile the genomic localization of 5hmC and will describe their application to profiling 5hmC in mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells that express or lack Tet2.
