    "abstract_text": "Background: Almost two thirds of transplant-ineligible, treatment na\u00efve multiple myeloma (NDMM, TNE) patients (pts) do not proceed to second line anti-MM therapy. Given depth of response to initial therapy correlates to overall survival (OS), a deep remission should also be the target for this cohort of generally elderly and frail patients. However, this should not come at the expense of either treatment-related or fiscal toxicity. IRIL is a phase II, multicentre, response-adapted study examining treatment intensification with isatuximab (Isa; supported by Sanofi/Genzyme), an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, for pts not achieving pre-defined target responses to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd). Method: TNE NDMM pts meeting IMWG criteria for treatment are eligible for enrolment. Pts commence treatment with lenalidomide [25mg D1-D21 of a 28-day cycle (C)] and dexamethasone [40mg (20mg for those aged \u00b375 years) PO weekly]. Failure to achieve pre-defined target response [<PR after 4 cycles, <VGPR after 6, or <CR after 9 cycles of Rd] or progressive disease (PD) within the first 9 cycles of Rd leads to addition of Isa (10mg/kg IV weekly for cycle 1, then fortnightly) until PD or adverse events (AEs) that warrant treatment cessation. The primary endpoint is to evaluate the rate of achievement of \u00b3PR following completion of 6 cycles Isa-Rd in those who failed to achieve <PR after C4 Rd. The secondary endpoints are to evaluate overall improvement in depth of response to Isa-Rd, progression free survival (PFS), OS, and safety. Results: From June 2019 to June 2021, 42 pts [52.3% male, median age 77.7 yrs (range 68.5-86.0), R-ISS Stage I (n=8), Stage II (n=23) and Stage III (n=7)] were accrued. 30 pts have completed at least C4 Rd and were deemed evaluable (12 non-evaluable; 5 only recently recruited, 5 withdrew consent (WD) due to logistic reasons, 2 PD pre-C4 and were taken of study at investigator discretion). Of the 30 evaluable pts (see Figure 1), 25 remain on study with 2 further WD (logistic reasons) and 3 deaths. In total, 25pts have had treatment intensification with Isa [9pts (5<PR and 4 PD) prior to C4 Rd, 11/13 eligible < VGPR after C6 Rd (1 omission in error, 1 pt WD consent), 4/5 eligible pts < CR after C9 Rd (1 omission in error) and 1 PD at C6]. 18/25 patients have had at least 6 months of Isa intensification with increased depth of response in 12 (66.7%) pts. Of the 9 pts rescued with Isa after not reaching target response post C4 Rd, 7 have completed 6 Isa-Rd cycles with 100% deepening of response (5 PR, 4 VGPR). The overall response rate in the cohort of evaluable patients is 100% (16 PR, 14 VGPR). The median (\u00b1SD) follow-up time of the evaluable cohort was 9.96 \u00b1 6.24 months with med OS not reached. Thirty-one (73.8%) pts experienced any grade AE (median = 6; range 1-21). Grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported in 16 pts (34 events in total; median per pt = 2; range 1-5). Most common \u00b3 Grade 3 events include infection (10), neutropenia (7) and insomnia and mood disorder (3 each). Neutropenia was the single grade 4 AE in a patient on Rd. Fewer of the reported grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred while on Isa-Rd (16) than while on Rd alone (n=18) with causality was less frequently attributed to Isa (n=4) than R (n=17) or d (n=14). Conclusion: A response-adapted approach for TNE NDMM pts with isatuximab intensification upon inadequate response to standard-of-care lenalidomide-dexamethasone is both safe and effective. Isa-Rd leads to universal deepening of response in patients failing to achieve a PR or better after 4 months of Rd, while the overall response rate in evaluable patients, irrespective of initial response to Rd, is 100%. Isa-Rd is well tolerated in this elderly patient cohort. The safety profile for the combination Isa-Rd is similar to previous reports. Patient accrual is ongoing.
