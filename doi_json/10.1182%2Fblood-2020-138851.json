    "abstract_text": "Introduction Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with a hyperinflammatory, pro-thrombotic state and a high mortality. A thrombotic phenotype rather than a coagulopathy is suggested and we undertook plasma exchange to determine its effects on organ function and thrombo-inflammatory markers. Methods Plasma exchange was carried out in seven critically ill adults with severe COVID-19 respiratory failure (PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio 800 IU/L and D dimer>1000 \u00b5g/L (or doubling from baseline). Patients received a daily single volume 3 litre plasma exchange for a minimum of five days. No other immunomodulatory medications were initiated during this period. Effects on organ function, thrombo-inflammatory markers and complications were monitored. Seven patients matched for age and baseline biochemistry were a comparator group. Results Coagulation screening revealed no evidence of coagulopathy. However, von Willebrand Factor (VWF) activity, antigen and VWF antigen:ADAMTS13 ratio, Factor VIII and D-dimers were all elevated. Following five days of plasma exchange, plasma levels of all the above, and ferritin levels, were significantly reduced (p<0.05, Figure 1) while lymphocyte count normalized (p<0.05). The P a O 2 :FiO 2 ratio increased from a median(IQR) of 11.6 (10.8- 19.7) kPa to 18.1 (16.0-25.9) kPa (p<0.05). Similar improvements were not observed in controls. Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred among 5 patients in the control arm but not in patients who underwent plasma exchange. Conclusion Plasma exchange was associated with an improvement in oxygenation, decreased incidence of AKI, normalisation of lymphocytes and reduction in circulating thrombo-inflammatory markers including D-Dimer and VWF Ag:ADAMTS13 ratio.
