    "abstract_text": "Background Momelotinib (MMB, GS-0387, CYT387) is a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor under investigation for the treatment of myelofibrosis. Preliminary results of a phase I/II core study (n=166) were previously reported. Subjects who achieved at least stable disease in the core study could continue MMB treatment in an extension study (n=120). Final data from the phase I/II core study and updated data from the extension study are presented. Methods Subjects with myelofibrosis categorized as IPSS intermediate-2 or high risk, or intermediate-1 risk with symptomatic splenomegaly or hepatomegaly and/or unresponsive to available therapy, were enrolled. Following a dose escalation phase, subjects were treated on a dose expansion phase in the core study with MMB at either 150 mg or 300 mg once-daily, or 150 mg twice-daily for 9 months. In the extension study, MMB was at the same dose the subject tolerated and derived clinical benefit from in the core study. Clinical responses were adjudicated according to IWG-MRT criteria. Spleen Response was defined as \u2265 50% reduction in palpable splenomegaly that lasted \u2265 8 weeks (wks) for baseline splenomegaly \u2265 10 cm, plus resolution of palpable splenomegaly that lasted \u2265 8 wks for baseline splenomegaly > 5 to < 10 cm. Anemia Response was defined as transfusion-free interval of \u2265 12 wks for baseline transfusion dependence, plus \u2265 2 g/dL rise in hemoglobin (Hb) for baseline transfusion independence and Hb < 10 g/dL. Baseline transfusion dependence was defined as \u2265 2U RBC transfusion in the 30 days prior to first dose of MMB or identified as transfusion dependent in medical history. Results As of April 2013, 58 of 120 subjects remained on treatment in the open-label extension study, with median treatment duration of 507 days (range 23-1036) for both core and extension studies. Based on interim analysis, the most common reasons for discontinuation from the extension study were disease progression (n=13), investigator's decision (n=12), and consent withdrawal (n=10), with 2 drug-related adverse events (both peripheral neuropathy) that led to study discontinuation. Efficacy data for the core and extension studies are depicted in table below. Table  . Number of Subjects (%) .

Median duration of 12-week transfusion independence was not yet reached (91-987 days), median duration of Anemia Response was not yet reached (57-987). Constitutional symptoms assessment at 3 months for the core study showed \u2265 50% improvement in 72%, 46%, 77%, 100%, and 74% of subjects with pruritis, cough, bone pain, fever, and night sweats respectively. Most common Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related events were thrombocytopenia (29%), neutropenia (5%), and elevated lipase (4%) without clinical pancreatitis. Peripheral neuropathy was reported by 38% of subjects, all \u2264 Grade 2, with 17 subjects experiencing neuropathy at baseline. Four subjects transformed into acute leukemia (1 in core study, 3 in extension study). There was no treatment-related death. Conclusion Prolonged administration of MMB for treatment of myelofibrosis is well tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile. MMB is efficacious in durably reducing myelofibrosis-related splenomegaly as well as improving transfusion requirement and disease-related symptoms. These data form the basis for the phase 3 randomized study of MMB in myelofibrosis.
