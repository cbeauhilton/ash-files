    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-22 The NLR gene family encodes proteins that are comprised of conserved nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and leucine rich-repeats (LRR). These genes are conserved from plants, lower animals to mammals. Family members include CIITA, NOD1, NOD2, and NLRP3. Several of these genes are genetically linked to immunodeficiency, inflammatory and immune diseases. This large gene family controls a number of innate responses, including inflammasome function leading to IL-1b/IL-18 production, cell death and type I IFN production. This talk will discuss the broad function of this family of genes, with emphasis on their regulation of inflammation and innate immunity, and their divergent roles in pathogen responses. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
