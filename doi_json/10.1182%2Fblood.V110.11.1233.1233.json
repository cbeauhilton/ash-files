    "abstract_text": "C/EBP\u03b1 is a key transcription factor involved in myeloid differentiation and frequently mutated or deregulated in human acute myeloid leukemias (AML) as well as in blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Disruption of its function contributes to the differentiation block observed in these diseases and thus to leukemogenesis. Here, we have identified a conserved region in the C/EBP\u03b1 promoter that is important for activation of C/EBP\u03b1 transcription in myeloid cells and narrowed it down to a conserved site of approximately 25 bp that contains a consensus binding site for ZFP143, a seven-zinc finger transcription factor. In gel retardation assays, this region bound a factor of approximately 100 kDa that we biochemically purified and identified by mass spectrometry as being indeed ZFP143. In vivo binding of ZFP143 to its bona fide binding site in the C/EBP\u03b1 promoter was also detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. We are now studying the in vivo effect of ZFP143 on C/EBP\u03b1 transcription in mice that carry an inducible gene trap in the ZFP143 locus. While mice homozygous for the active gene trap - that prevents ZFP143 transcription - die at an early embryonic stage, preliminary data from heterozygous mice shows indeed a reduction of C/EBP\u03b1 mRNA levels, suggesting a role for ZFP143 in C/EBP\u03b1 transcription activation. Ongoing experiments aim at selectively inactivating ZFP143 in the hematopoietic system using the Mx1-Cre / loxP system.",
