    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1644 INTRODUCTION: Rituximab penetration in central nervous system is largely unknown in human. Experiments in monkeys showed that 0,1% of serum rituximab concentration was achieved in cerebrospinal fluid. Reports in patients are limited (Rubenstein JL, Blood 2003 and Petereit HF, Multiple Sclerosis 2009). They demonstrated similar low levels of cerebrospinal fluid penetration with standard dose (375 mg /m 2 ) rituximab in patients with central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma or multiple sclerosis. METHOD: We conducted a phase 2 trial in patients with primary CNS lymphoma. Patients were treated with an intravenous combination of high dose methotrexate (8 g/m 2 ), high dose cytarabine (2 g/m 2 ) and high dose rituximab (750 mg/m 2 every 1\u20132 weeks \u00d7 13 infusions). We obtained from four patients paired cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples and rituximab concentration were determined in each. Samples were collected at different time points just before rituximab infusion and represent trough levels. RESULTS: 11 cerebrospinal fluid samples were available and their 11 paired serum samples. Mean cerebrospinal fluid and serum levels were 2,04 ug/mL (0,49\u20134,08) and 297,09 ug/mL (211,26\u2013504,47) respectively. Mean cerebrospinal fluid levels were 0,71% (0,18\u20131,5%) of serum levels. No relationship was made between cerebrospinal fluid level and the number of rituximab dose administered. CONCLUSION: In patients with primary CNS lymphoma receiving high dose 1\u20132 weekly rituximab. cerebrospinal fluid concentration achieve is low compared to serum levels. However, administration of higher dose of intravenous rituximab can increase penetration in central nervous system but its clinical impact is unknown as cerebrospinal fluid levels are still low.
