    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3039 Bone resorption is commonly associated with aging, but also with certain cancers. Recent studies identified Receptor Activator of NF-\u03baB (RANK) ligand (RANKL) and its receptors RANK and osteoprotegerin as key regulators of bone remodelling. Multiple myeloma (MM) disrupts the balance within this molecule system towards osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction. Neutralization of RANKL by the monoclonal antibody Denosumab (AMG162) is presently being evaluated for treatment of both non-malignant and malignant osteolysis. We found, in line with previously published data, that primary MM cells (9 of 10) express substantial levels of RANKL at the cell surface and that MM cells directly release RANKL in soluble form (sRANKL). Next we evaluated the possibility to combine neutralization of sRANKL with targeting of MM cells for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of NK cells utilizing RANK-Ig fusion proteins with modified Fc portions. Compared to wildtype RANK-Fc, our mutants (S239D/I332E and E233P/L234V/L235A/DG236/A327G/A330S) displayed highly enhanced (RANK-Fc-ADCC) and abrogated (RANK-Fc-KO) affinity, respectively, to the NK cell Fc\u03b3RIIIa, but comparable capacity to neutralize RANKL in binding competition and osteoclast formation assays. Analyses with RANKL transfectants and RANKL-negative controls confirmed the high and lacking potential of the RANK-Fc-ADCC and the RANK-Fc-KO to induce NK ADCC, respectively, and ascertained that the RANK-Fc-ADCC specifically induced NK cell lysis of RANKL-expressing but not RANKL-negative target cells. Most notably, in cultures of NK cells with RANKL-expressing primary MM cells RANK-Fc-ADCC potently enhanced NK cell degranulation, cytokine release and MM cells lysis due to enhanced NK reactivity. Thus, our Fc-engineered RANK-Fc-ADCC fusion protein may both neutralize detrimental effects of sRANKL and enhance NK anti-tumor reactivity by targeting RANKL-expressing malignant cells thereby constituting an attractive immunotherapeutic means for treatment of MM.
