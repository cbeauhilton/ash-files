    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Family clustering of hematological tumours has largely been reported in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Objectives: To identify clinical and biological parameters at diagnosis that could be associated to family history of haematological neoplasms in CLL patients. Methods: Eighty-five unselected consecutive CLL patients were included in the case-control multicenter study Epilymph_Spain. Immunophenotype data, including CD38 expression, genetics and clinical presentation were performed at diagnosis. Personnel interviews were conducted to collect data on family history of cancer, including site, age at diagnosis, and status of the affected relative. Statistical differences between each group were analysed using Chi-Square tests. Results: Out of the 85 CLL patients included in the study, 50 (59%) reported a first-degree relative with cancer, from which 7 (8%) were haematological tumours. In the following table, the most relevant variables related with the family history of hematological neoplasms in CLL patients are presented. Conclusions: Family history of haematological neoplasms, CD38 expression and younger age at presentation of the disease seems to identify a subgroup of CLL patients that could have a genetic origin.  .
