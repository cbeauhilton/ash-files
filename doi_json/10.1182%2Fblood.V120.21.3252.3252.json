    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3252 Renal failure is an independent marker for developing other forms of chronic organ damage and for early mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD). We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional chart review of 292 adults with SCD (type SS or S-beta thal) treated at the University of Illinois Medical Center to assess the prevalence and factors related to kidney damage. Data was recorded from a clinic visit at least four weeks from a vaso-occlusive pain episode or red blood cell transfusion. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated using the modification of diet in renal disease formula. Hemoglobinuria was defined by dipstick urinalysis showing trace, small, or moderate blood and 300 mg/g were categorized as microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, respectively. The median age was 33 years and 46% of patients were on hydroxyurea. We observed microalbuminuria in 41%, macroalbuminuria in 20%, hemoglobinuria in 41% and GFR <90 mL/min in 20% of adults with SCD. Univariate associations with GFR <90 mL/min are summarized in Table 1 . By logistic regression, macroalbuminuria (OR 7.5, 95% CI: 2.5\u201322.2; p<0.0001) and age (OR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06\u20131.16; p <0.0001) were independent predictors of GFR <90 mL/min (r 2 = 0.23). Given the strong correlation of macroalbuminuria with GFR <90 mL/min, we explored factors related to degree of albuminuria. Univariate associations with degree of albuminuria are shown in Table 2 . Logistic regression showed that independent predictors for macroalbuminuria were the presence of hemoglobinuria (OR 93.7, 95% CI: 15.2\u2013576.5; p<0.0001) and age (OR 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01\u20131.14; p=0.03) (r 2 =0.28, p<0.0001). We further explored predictors of hemoglobinuria given its independent association with macroalbuminuria. By logistic regression, the strongest predictor of hemoglobinuria was the natural log LDH (OR 32.4; 95% CI: 8.4\u2013124.9; p<0.0001) (r 2 =0.22), but other markers of hemolysis including higher absolute reticulocyte count, greater indirect bilirubin concentration and lower hemoglobin concentration were also associated with hemoglobinuria in univariate analyses. In summary, increasing age and macroalbuminuria were independent factors associated with GFR < 90mL/min in this cohort of adults with SCD, and intravascular hemolysis as reflected in hemoglobin-positive urine dipstick with negative microscopy was associated with macroalbuminuria. Further research is needed to determine if measures to decrease intravascular hemolysis and to prevent the development of macroalbuminuria can preserve renal function in patients with SCD. Investigation is also needed to identify genomic and genetic markers that put patients at risk for kidney disease and might serve as targets for preventive and therapeutic interventions.
