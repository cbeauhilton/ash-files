    "abstract_text": "Azacitidine (AZA), a demethylating agent, has recently been demonstrated to have efficacy in the treatment of myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia. A potential concern when considering the use of this agent is a recent report demonstrating AZA-mediated re-activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression facilitating the invasive metastatic phenotype (Sato NM et al J Natl Cancer Inst. 2003 Feb 19;95(4):327\u201330). Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are a recently identified class of agents with considerable in vitro and in vivo activity and early phase clinical efficacy in the treatment of haematological malignancies (Bolden JE Nat Rev Drug Discov . 2006 Sep;5(9):769\u201384). Pre-clinical in vitro studies suggest that addition of HDACi to 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine, a derivative of AZA, enhances the efficacy of this agent (Yang H et al Leuk Res . 2005 Jul; 29(7):739\u201348) whilst early phase clinical trials identify therapeutic activity using a combination of demethylating agents and HDACi (Garcia-Manero G, Blood . 2006 Nov 15;108(10):3271\u20139). Our current study aimed to determine the in vitro activity and molecular mechanisms of action of the novel HDACi MCT-3, a derivative of Oxamflatin, a hydroxamate analogue, (Dear AE, et al, Org Biomol Chem , 2006, 4, 3778\u20133784) in the HL-60 cell line alone and combination with AZA. AZA (1.0 microM) and MCT-3 (2.5 microM) alone inhibited HL-60 cell growth over 24hrs by 40%, 30% respectively. The combination of AZA with MCT-3 inhibited HL-60 cell growth up to 50%. Real-time PCR demonstrated that AZA and MCT-3 alone increased p15 INK4b and Caspase 3 mRNA expression 2 fold. A Combination of AZA with MCT-3 increased p15 INK4b and Caspase 3 mRNA expression up to 2.5 and increased p21 WAF1/CIP1 and the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 expression 2 fold. A combination of AZA and MCT-3 significantly attenuated AZA-induced MMP-9 mRNA expression and proteolytic activity. AZA and MCT-3 alone reduce HL-60 cell growth in vitro . Addition of MCT-3 to AZA increased inhibition of cell growth, suggesting that this HDACi may have the potential for additive activity with demethylating agents. AZA and MCT-3 have similar effects on expression of genes implicated in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Increased expression of p21 WAF1/CIP1 and the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 via inhibition of cell cycle progression and enhanced apoptosis may in part be responsible for the enhanced anti-leukaemia activity of the combination of AZA and MCT-3. Importantly MCT-3 is able to inhibit AZA-mediated induction of MMP-9 expression."
