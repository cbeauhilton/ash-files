    "abstract_text": "Acquired Aplastic anemia (AA) is a bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by pancytopenia and marrow hypoplasia, and is mediated by immune destruction of hematopoietic stem cells. Mutations in several genes including telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex, consisting of a reverse transcriptase enzyme (TERT), an RNA template (TERC), and several stabilizing proteins, and the associated shelterin complexes have been found in both congenital and idiopathic AA. In particular, several TERT and TER C mutations reduce telomerase activity in vitro and accelerate telomere attrition in vivo . Shortened telomeres have been observed in a third of idiopathic AA patients, but only 10% of these patients have mutations in genes of the telomerase complex. We have recently demonstrated that in addition to keeping telomeres from shortening, telomerase directly regulates transcriptional programs of developmentally relevant genes (Ghosh et al, Nat Cell Biol, 2012, 14, 1270). We postulate that changes in expression of telomerase associated genes, specifically TERT, contribute to the etiology of aplastic anemia. In an effort to better understand the molecular and clinical correlates of this disease, 24 idiopathic AA patient samples were collected at a tertiary medical center in Bangalore, India. Following informed consent, we performed RT-PCR analysis on harvested RNA from each patient and measured levels of TERT expression compared to that of normal controls (n=6). An 8 fold reduction in TERT expression was observed in 17/24 patients, while 7/24 patients maintained normal TERT expression. In general, TERT-low patients were younger in age (mean age 29y) compared with the TERT-normal patients (mean age 40y). TERT-low patients were more likely to have severe aplastic anemia (SAA) leading to higher mortality and poorer response to therapy, with 6/17 patients dying and 4/17 not responding to ATG therapy. Targeted panel sequencing of the 24 samples on an Illumina platform revealed that while TERT-normal patients had no mutations in genes associated with the telomerase/shelterin complex, TERT-low patients carried predicted pathogenic variants in TERT, TEP1, TINF2, NBN, TPP1, HSP90A and POT1 genes, all associated with the telomerase complex. Somatic gene variants were also identified in other AA associated genes, PRF1 and CDAN1 , in the TERT-low cohort. In addition, novel predicted pathogenic mutations associated with the shelterin complex were found in two TERT-low patients in the TNKS gene. We also detected mutations in TET2, BCORL1, FLT-3, MLP and BRAF genes in TERT-low patients. Mutations in these genes are associated with clonal evolution, disease progression and poor prognosis. Our observations were further illustrated in a single patient where normal TERT expression was noted at initial clinical presentation. ATG therapy led to CR, but the patient returned within a year and succumbed to E.coli related sepsis. At that stage he had low TERT expression, suggesting that TERT expression can change as the disease progresses. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that loss of TERT expression correlates with disease severity and poor prognosis. Our observations further suggest that preliminary and periodic evaluation of TERT expression levels in AA patients is likely to serve as a predictor of disease severity and influence the choice of therapy.
