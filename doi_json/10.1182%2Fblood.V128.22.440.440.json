    "abstract_text": "T-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) are aggressive hematologic tumors resulting from the malignant transformation of T cell progenitors. In this context, constitutive activation of NOTCH1 signaling is the most prominent oncogenic pathway in T cell transformation. Yet functional role(s) of NOTCH1 in T-ALL pathogenesis and precise mechanism(s) of action remain to be fully determined. SHQ1 is an essential assembly factor for H/ACA ribonucleoproteins which are required for spliceosomal small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation. We here identify SHQ1 as a NOTCH1 downstream target that plays a pivotal role in maintaining MYC splicing fidelity and promoting T-ALL cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo . We identified SHQ1 as a NOTCH1-regulated gene from multiple human T-ALL genome-wide expression studies. To validate this finding, we analyzed SHQ1 expression in a spectrum of human T-ALL cells upon NOTCH1 pathway inhibition. NOTCH1 inactivation caused a marked downregulation of SHQ1 in all T-ALL cell lines tested. We further demonstrated NOTCH1 bound to the canonical CSL binding sites in the SHQ1 promoter and directly activated the transcription. We next systematically analyzed the SHQ1 expression in 174 T-ALL primary samples and found that SHQ1 expression was significantly elevated in T-ALL compared with normal peripheral blood. To explore the functional role of SHQ1, we knocked it down in T-ALL using specific shRNAs. SHQ1 depletion profoundly inhibited T-ALL cell proliferation and induced massive apoptotic cell death. Consistent with these in vitro findings, SHQ1 depletion in a human T-ALL xenograft significantly delayed leukemia onset and prolonged survival. To decipher the molecular mechanism whereby SHQ1 contributes to T cell leukemogenesis, we performed genome-wide RNA-Seq and analyzed alternative splicing across the genome. Approximately 70% of genes exhibited abnormal intron retention upon SHQ1 depletion. Among those whose expression levels and mRNA splicing were prominently altered by SHQ1, MYC gained our attention because of its vital role in T-ALL. Depletion of SHQ1 resulted in marked downregulation of mature MYC mRNA and protein. Endogenous mRNA analysis and mini-gene experiments showed aberrant accumulation of MYC pre-mRNA in SHQ1-depleted cells. Expectedly, SHQ1 knockdown had minimal effects on T-ALL cells constitutively expressing a human MYC protein. In addition to the well-documented transcriptional control of MYC by NOTCH1, we herein report a previously unsuspected mechanism in which NOTCH1 modulates MYC splicing by activation of SHQ1. Our findings not only shed new insights in the molecular pathology of NOTCH1-induced T-ALL but also provide a new layer of regulation of oncogene MYC at the post-transcriptional level, mechanism of which may apply to other MYC involved tumors.
