    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5157 Background: With the development of diagnostic technique, an accurate diagnosis of hereditary hemolytic anemia (HHA)- red blood cell (RBC) membranopathy, hemoglobinopathy, RBC enzymopahty \u2013 have been made. Therefore, we surveyed the prevalence and characteristics of patients diagnosed as HHA during recent five years in Korea. Methods: Through the use of questionnaires, information on the clinical and laboratory findings of HHA diagnosed from 2007 to 2011 in Korea was collected. The globin gene analysis (direct sequencing) and RBC enzyme analysis was performed at the representative laboratories. A total of 203 cases were collected in this study by the Korean Hereditary Hemolytic Anemia Working Party of the Korean Society of Hematology. Results: Patients number of RBC membranopathy, hemoglobinopathy, and RBC enzymopahty was 125, 47, and 31, respectively. Percentage of patients with dominant family history was 57% in patients with hereditary spherocytosis (n=116) and dominant symptoms were anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly and gallstones. Osmotic fragility test and flow cytometric method for detection of RBC membrane defect were performed about 60% of patients. RBC membrane protein analysis using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 59 patients. Of the 47 cases of hemoglobinopathies, 36 cases (77%) were \u03b2-thalassemia minor, 10 cases (21%) were \u03b1-thalassemia minor and one case (2%) was unstable Hb, Hb M-Saskatoon (beta 64 His-\u2192Tyr). Median age at diagnosis was 7 years (range: 6 months\u201358 years). Eleven of 47 cases (23%) had family history of HHA. As all thalassemia patients were thalassemia minor, they presented with mild jaundice or pallor. Of the 31 patients were diagnosed as RBC membranopathy, pyruvate kinase deficiency was 3 cases and glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency was 2, and other various forms were reported. Conclusions: We could confirm that accurate diagnosis has been made in more patients using elegant diagnostic technique. However, more defined diagnostic approaches were needed in this rare disease and further systematic supporting systems for patients and their families were warranted in public health aspect.
