    "abstract_text": "Factor VIII (fVIII) inhibitory antibodies (fVIII inhibitors) are a significant source of morbidity in patients with hemophilia A. Approximately 30% of patients with severe hemophilia A will develop inhibitors. Most inhibitors are directed against either the A2 or C2 domains of fVIII. The repertoire of antibodies to the C2 domain is functionally complex, including antibodies that inhibit fVIII binding to phospholipid and von Willebrand factor and display either type I or type II kinetics. The goal of this study was to investigate the diversity of the immune response to the C2 domain of human fVIII in a murine hemophilia A model and to identify a set of non-overlapping epitopes recognized by these fVIII inhibitors. A panel of 55 murine anti-C2 antibodies was obtained, which included 53 antibodies from anti-fVIII hybridomas produced in our laboratory and previously described antibodies ESH-4 and ESH-8. Nine of the hybridomas were cloned by limiting dilution and the corresponding monoclonal IgG antibodies were purified. IgG from the remaining 44 hybridomas was isolated directly from the hybridoma supernatants and biotinylated. The 9 monoclonal antibodies along with ESH-4 and ESH-8 were used as primary antibodies in a competition ELISA using human fVIII as the antigen. The panel of 55 biotinylated antibodies was used as secondary antibodies. Antibody pairs were classified as having non-overlapping or overlapping epitopes based on whether the binding of the secondary antibody was present or absent, respectively. A basis set of 3 antibodies, 1B5-1B, 3E6-1B, and (2)117-1B, was defined, which consisted of a set of non-overlapping antibodies that as a group competed for binding of human fVIII with all other antibodies. 1B5-1B and 3E6-1B exhibited type I kinetics with Bethesda titers of 950 and 30, respectively. The Bethesda titer of (2)117-1B could not be determined due to its type II behavior. ESH-4 and ESH-8 had the same epitope profiles as 3E6-1B and (2)117-1B, respectively. Of the 52 non-basis set antibodies, 85% overlapped with 1B5-1B, 29% with 3E6-1B, and 56% with (2)117-1B. The majority of the antibodies overlapped with more than one member of the basis set, leading to the identification of five classes of antibodies (see figure). Because of the large number of antibodies characterized, it is unlikely that the frequency of antibodies in any additional classes is high. The elucidation of the structural complexity of the anti-fVIII C2 repertoire should be useful in the characterization of the pathogenicity of C2 inhibitors.
