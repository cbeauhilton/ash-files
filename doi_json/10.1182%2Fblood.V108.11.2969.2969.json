    "abstract_text": "Defibrotide (DF) is a polydisperse mixture of 90 % single-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides with anti-thrombotic, pro-fibrinolytic and anti-apoptotic functions. DF is already successfully used in the treatment of hepatic veno-occlusive disease in allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Our observation that DF can also protect endothelial cells (EC) from conditioning (fludarabine (F-Ara))-mediated apoptosis( 1 ) prompted us to apply it prophylactically to patients (pts) at risk for endothelial complications. Pending on the magnitude of risk, pts received 200\u2013800mg every 6h in 2h-infusions, usually from day (d) \u22127 until d+21 post SCT. Circulating EC (CEC) as a marker of conditioning-mediated endothelial toxicity( 2 ) were detected by magnetic bead separation of CD146+ cells from EDTA blood of 50 SCT pts (33 DF, 17 NO DF) and co-staining with Ulex Europaeus antigen lectin 1. CEC maxima until d+100 post SCT were compared between the two groups. DF pts showed significantly lower maxima of CEC than untreated pts (1085 [\u00b11012] in the DF treatment group vs. 2595 [\u00b11910] CEC/mL in non-DF pts, respectively, p=0.0007). Similarly, when CEC maxima were compared in the time period of DF prophylaxis, again, DF pts had less cell counts (562 [\u00b1794] vs. 1548 [\u00b11575] CEC/mL in control pts, respectively, p=0.005). Interestingly, this observation also held true for the heavily pre-treated diagnostic subgroup of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) pts (683 [\u00b1807] DF vs. 3467 [\u00b12664] non-DF, p=0.007). These preliminary analyses suggest the protective efficacy of DF prophylaxis in the course of SCT. The final proof of principle is to be validated in long-term clinical follow-ups.",
