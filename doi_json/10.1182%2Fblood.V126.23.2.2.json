    "abstract_text": "Induction of fetal-type hemoglobin (HbF: \u03b1 2 \u03b3 2 ) is a promising means to treat hemoglobinopathies; however, precisely how HbF expression is silenced in adult erythroid cells is not fully understood. Such knowledge is essential to develop mechanism-based, targeted approaches to reactivate HbF production. Here, we show that Leukemia/lymphoma Related Factor (LRF), encoded by the ZBTB7A gene, is a novel and potent repressor of HbF production. To assess the effects of LRF loss on the mouse erythroid transcriptome, we performed RNA-Seq analysis using splenic erythroblasts from control and LRF conditional knockout ( Zbtb7a F/F Mx1-Cre+) mice. LRF-deficient adult erythroblasts showed significant induction of Hbb-bh1 , but not Hbb-y . The results were validated at the protein levels via isoelectric focusing of peripheral blood (PB) hemolysates and MALDI-TOFMS analysis. LRF loss also reactivated human fetal globin expression in vivo in LRF conditional KO mice harboring the human \u03b2-globin gene cluster as a yeast artificial chromosome transgene (\u03b2-YAC). To determine whether LRF loss could induce HbF in human erythroid cells, we employed human CD34 + hematopoietic stem and progenitor (HSPC)-derived primary erythroblasts and determined \u03b3-globin expression levels upon shRNA-mediated LRF knockdown (KD). HbF levels in LRF KD cells (49-70%) were much greater than those seen in parental or scrambled-shRNA transduced cells. We next employed a novel human immortalized erythroid line (HUDEP-2). This line possesses an advantage over lines currently used for globin switching studies because it expresses predominantly adult hemoglobin (HbA: \u03b1 2 \u03b2 2 ), with very low background HbF expression. Using CRISPR/cas9 gene modification, we knocked out ZBTB7A in HUDEP-2 cells and performed RNA-Seq analysis. As expected, \u03b3-globin ( HBG1 and HBG2 ) transcripts, but not those of embryonic \u03b5-globin ( HBE1 ), were markedly induced in ZBTB7A KO ( ZBTB7A \u0394/\u0394 ) HUDEP-2 cells. ZBTB7A \u0394/\u0394 cells exhibited HbF levels greater than 60%, while that of parental cells was less than 3%. Notably, the HbF reactivation occurred without changes in levels of transcripts encoding known HbF repressors, including BCL11A, the principal known switching factor. We next performed chromatin-immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-Seq) with an anti-LRF antibody using HSPC-derived proerythroblasts and HUDEP-2 cells. The most enriched motif identified in either was concordant with that previously identified in vitro using CAST analysis (Maeda et. al. Nature 2005), confirming antibody specificity. Supporting a direct role of LRF at the \u03b2-globin cluster, we observed several significant enrichment of LRF-ChIP binding signals at adult ( HBB ), fetal ( HBG1 ) globin loci and the upstream hypersensitivity (HS) sites within the locus control region (LCR). ATAC-Seq (for assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing) analysis revealed strong chromatin accessibility at the \u03b3-globin locus in ZBTB7A \u0394/\u0394 cells. Strikingly, differential enrichment of ATAC-signals in ZBTB7A \u0394/\u0394 cells was evident only at the \u03b3-locus. Thus, while LRF binds to the HBB locus and HS sites as well as to the HBG1 locus, LRF depletion specifically opens chromatin at the \u03b3-globin locus. Finally, to determine whether LRF and BCL11A suppress \u03b3-globin expression via distinct mechanisms, we established LRF/BCL11A double knockout HUDEP-2 cells. Strikingly, HUDEP-2 lines lacking both LRF and BCL11A exhibited almost a complete switch in expression from adult- to fetal-type globin, suggesting that these two factors cumulatively represent the near entirety of \u03b3-globin repressive activity in adult erythroid cells. Our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism regulating \u03b3-globin silencing and may open a new window for therapeutic targeting in the treatment of hemoglobinopathies.
