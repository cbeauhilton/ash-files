    "abstract_text": "Background CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cell (Treg), the most significant subset of regulatory T cells, has been found to play an important role in suppressing allogenetic immune response and controlling GVHD recently. The present single-center study monitored the ratio of CD4 + CD25 high T cells and the expression of FOXP3 gene in peripheral blood post-transplant to assess the reconstitution of CD4 + CD25 high Treg early after allogenetic stem cell transplantation and its correlations with aGVHD. Methods: 22 patients undergoing allo-HSCT were enrolled. To detect the CD4 + CD25 + T cells and the CD4 + CD25 high T cells subpopulations ratio in CD4 + T lymphocytes(CD4 + CD25 +/ CD4 + ACD4 + CD25 high /CD4 + ) Athe CD4 + CD25 high T cells subpopulations ratio in CD4 + CD25 + T cells(CD4 + CD25 high/ CD4 + CD25 + ) Aand the expression of FOXP3 mRNA in the donor graft and periperal blood frequently after transplantation with the flow cytometry and real-time PCR assays. Results: \\|[Dagger]\\|@CD4 + CD25 high /CD4 + and CD4 + CD25 high /CD4 + CD25 + ratios in the donor graft were significantly lower in the aGVHD group( P <0.05)\u2021AEarly after transplantation, Both groups\u2019CD4 + CD25 + /CD4 + ratio in peripheral blood increased significantly than that in the donor graft( P <0.05).CD4 + CD25 high /CD4 + and CD4 + CD25 high /CD4 + CD25 + ratios were also significantly higher than that in donor graft in the aGVHD group, but not in the no-aGVHD group.\u2021BThe expression of FOXP3 in two groups after transplantation increased gradually, until six months after transplantation, its expression was still below the control level( P <0.05). The expression of FOXP3 was lower in the aGVHD group. Conclusion: \\|[Dagger]\\|@The early activation and proliferation of the CD4 + CD25 high regulatory T cells is critical for the maintainance of immune hemostasis and the control of aGVHD.\u2021AThe occurrence of aGVHD is related with lower ratios of CD4 + CD25 high regulatory T cells in CD4 + T cells and activated CD4 + effector T cells.\u2021BaGVHD may affect the quantities of CD4 + CD25 high regulatory T cells and the expression of FOXP3."
