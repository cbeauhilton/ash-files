    "abstract_text": "Background: AMD3100, an inhibitor of SDF1 binding to CXCR4, synergizes with G-CSF to allow mobilization of sufficient CD34+ cells/kg for autologous transplantation in pts unable to collect adequate CD34+ cells with G-CSF alone. Therefore, a single patient use (SPU) protocol for AMD3100 was adopted for more than one patient entry per site and termed Compassionate Use Protocol (CUP). The only difference of standard of care was the addition of AMD3100 to a G-CSF mobilization on the evening prior to each day of apheresis. Pts who could not proceed to apheresis due to low peripheral blood counts or pts who did not collect a minimum of 2 \u00d7 10^6 CD34+ cell/kg were eligible. Methods: Overall, more than 280 patients with proven poor mobilization including 137 NHL, 73 MM, and 31 HD have been included in CUP. A data audit was performed to validate data from pts with either non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM), or Hodgkin\u2019s Disease (HD). Sites were selected based on most patients entered, >3 of all diseases entered at a site, and sites conducting an AMD3100 trial. Audit included all pts, regardless of success or failure of the outcome; all information was collected on CRFs. Success of outcome was collection of \u2265 2\u00d710^6 CD34+ cells/kg during the CUP procedure. CUP apheresis was done on day 5 after G-CSF (10mg/kg SC QD) and AMD3100 (240mg/kg SC Q10 PM) starting day 4. Results: Charts and CRFs were available for review for 115 pts; 63 (55%) were NHL patients from 29 sites, 35 (30%) were MM from 23 sites and 17 (15%) were HD from 13 sites. Of these pts, 58% were male, the median age was 59 years (range 21\u201377), 88% were Caucasian, and patient weight ranged from 43\u2013128 kg. Prior treatments included a median of two regimens of chemotherapy in each of the three groups. Safety was generally favorable with no drug-related SAE\u2019s and with an AE profile similar to that seen in research trials. The rates of successful collection of \u2265 2\u00d710^6 CD34+ cells/kg per disease state as well as prior mobilization regimen are summarized in table 1. The median number of mobilizations for the successful patients was 3 days for NHL and HD and 4 for MM. Eighty-eight of the patients underwent transplantation with any cells. For example, of the 47 NHL patients transplanted, 24 had CUP only cells and 23 had mixed cells. The median number of days to engraftment was 11 for PMN and 18 for platelets. Long term follow up is limited, but there do not appear to be graft failures. At least 12 of the pts have died. Conclusions: AMD3100 in a poor mobilizer population is generally safe and well tolerated and is very effective in mobilizing > 2\u00d710^6 CD34+ cells/kg.
