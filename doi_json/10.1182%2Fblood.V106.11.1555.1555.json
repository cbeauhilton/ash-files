    "abstract_text": "Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy that is incurable with current approaches. The median survival for patients with MM is around four years and a significant proportion of patients experience a course characterized by multiple relapses treated with different therapies. The median survival for patients relapsing after the initial therapy is nearly 18 months and successive treatment strategies result in decreasing response durations, likely reflecting acquired drug resistance. In order to better understand the biological changes associated with advanced, relapsed, refractory MM, we compared gene expression profiles (GEP) of malignant plasma cells isolated from patients with relapsed refractory MM and compared them to plasma cells from patients with newly diagnosed MM. Methods: In order to obtain two relatively homogenous group of patients, we compared samples from 44 patient with newly diagnosed MM enrolled in the ECOG E1A00 clinical trial (comparing thalidomide and dexamethasone to dexamethasone alone) to 44 patients with relapsed refractory MM enrolled in a phase II trial of Velcade (SUMMIT), where most patients had four or more previous relapses. Plasma cells from bone marrow aspirates were separated by magnetic bead selection of CD138 positive cells and studied using Affymetrix HG-U133A chips using standard methodology. The arrays were analyzed using Genespring 7.2 software following GCRMA normalization and genes with differential expression between the two datasets were examined. Differentially expressed genes were further analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis program. Results: A total of 864 genes were identified which were at least two fold and significantly different between the newly diagnosed and relapsed patients. Using Ingenuity software, 437 of these genes were mapped to different biological networks. Examination of the canonical pathways demonstrated several important cellular pathways differentially regulated between the two groups. Several important mediators of the cytokines, receptors and respective signaling pathways appear to be down regulated in the relapsed group and included IGF-1, HGF, SDF-1 alpha, gp130 and importantly the MEK/ERK pathway. Additionally expression of adhesion molecules such as VCAM1 and PECAM was decreased in the relapsed group compared to newly diagnosed pts. There appear to increased tissue hypoxia in the relapsed marrow as indicated by up regulation of HIF-1 alpha as well increased levels of Placental growth factor. Myeloma cells from relapsed disease were characterized by decreased expression of mcl1, FLIP1, and bcl-xL and increased caspase 8 relative to newly diagnosed group. Also seen was decreased expression of the glucocorticoid and interferon receptors in the relapsed setting. Conclusion: Comparison of the GEP between MM cells from newly diagnosed and relapsed pts demonstrates important differences that have potential biological relevance. The plasma cell in the relapsed setting appears to be more independent of the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, differential expression of some of the genes provides clues to mechanisms of drug resistance commonly observed in the relapsed pts. We are in the process of validating some of the key findings from these analyses."
