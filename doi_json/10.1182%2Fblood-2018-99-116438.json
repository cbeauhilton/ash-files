    "abstract_text": "NRF2 is the master regulator for the cellular anti-oxidative stress response and previously shown to activate \u03b3-globin gene expression in human erythroid progenitor cells. The goal of this study was to expand on these findings by exploring the in vivo function of NRF2 using the human \u03b2-globin locus YAC transgenic (\u03b2YAC) mouse carrying the entire 248kb human \u03b2-globin locus ( HBB ). We observed that NRF2 activation by chronic dimethyl fumarate treatment of \u03b2YAC mice, induced human \u03b3-globin gene expression, but had no effect on the adult \u03b2-globin gene. Subsequently in a novel \u03b2YAC/NRF2 knockout mouse model established in our laboratory, we demonstrated that NRF2 loss increased mouse erythroid CD71 levels while reducing human \u03b3-globin gene expression during erythropoiesis in mouse embryonic E13.5 and E18.5 day fetal livers and peripheral blood. Furthermore, the ability of dimethyl fumarate to induce \u03b3-globin gene expression was abolished after NRF2 loss. By western blot analysis of nuclear protein, we confirmed that part of the mechanism of globin gene regulation by NRF2 loss involves a decline of global histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation levels, without changing histone acetylation. Interestingly, NRF2 loss decreased the protein levels of the DNA methylcytosine dioxygenases including TET1, TET2 and TET3. Analysis of DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation levels by DNA dot-blot assay of mouse E13.5 fetal livers isolated from \u03b2YAC/NRF2 knockout mice, showed inhibition of genome wide DNA hydroxymethylation, while DNA methylation was not affected. In addition, DNA immunoprecipitation confirmed decreased hydroxymethylation in the HBB locus control region (LCR) enhancer and \u03b3-globin gene region. These data suggest an essential role of NRF2 in modifying chromatin structure and assembling transcription complexes to regulate \u03b3-globin gene expression. ChIP assay to assess in vivo DNA-protein interactions showed decreased associations of histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation and trimethylation, TATA-binding protein and RNA polymerase II to the LCR and \u03b3-globin promoter after NRF2 loss. Final studies were conducted to evaluate long-range chromatin interactions between the LCR and individual globin genes by chromosome conformation capture assay. We observed decreased interactions between the LCR and \u03b3-globin gene promoter region after NRF2 loss while interactions in the adult \u03b2-globin was not affected suggesting NRF2 preferentially mediates \u03b3-globin gene regulation. In conclusion, our data suggest that NRF2 alters \u03b3-globin expression through epigenetic DNA/histone modifications in addition to direct DNA binding. Therefore, activation of NRF2 expression using small chemical compounds is an innovative strategy to induce \u03b3-globin gene transcription for the treatment of \u03b2-hemoglobinopathies.
