    "abstract_text": "Background : In clinical practice there is little consensus on treating patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) beyond first line therapy with steroids. Objectives : Describe the demographic and disease characteristics of adult ITP patients who receive treatment; Obtain the treatment approach for patients with ITP beyond first line treatment with steroids, with an emphasis on splenectomy; and Evaluate adverse bleeding outcomes associated with ITP. Methods : A retrospective chart review of ITP patients after initial therapy with steroids was conducted. Ten physicians (oncologists and hematologists) were recruited from across Canada and each physician provided at least 5 ITP cases for review. A total of 51 cases were reviewed and patients (> 18 years old) were required to have had more than 1 course of steroids as treatment to be eligible. Results : The average age of patients at diagnosis was 42 (range 3 to 82 years); 37 (73%) of the patients were female, and 37 (73%) were Caucasian. The median platelet count upon presentation was 5\u00d710 9 /L. Median lines of therapy after initial therapy was 3 (range 0 to 6). Second line therapies varied, but most commonly patients underwent splenectomy (43%), followed by continued steroid treatment (16%), steroids plus IV Ig (16%), IV Ig alone (14%), immunosuppressant alone (2%), and anti-D plus steroids (2%). Of the patients reviewed, 40 (78%) eventually underwent splenectomy. Of the 40 splenectomized patients, 27 were splenectomized within the first year of diagnosis and 35 underwent splenectomy during the first 5 years. In addition, 62 of the splenectomies were laparoscopic, and the median hospital stay for all procedures was 5 days (range 1 to 60 days). Immediate failure of splenectomy occurred in 18% of patients, and the one- and five- year relapse/failure rates (defined as platelet count < 30\u00d710 9 /L) were 38% and 55%, respectively. Other therapies following splenectomy included IV Ig, azathioprine, cyclosporine, danazol, mycophenolate, rituximab, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and anti-D. Only 6% of IV Ig use was for chronic maintenance therapy and 74% of use was for urgent therapy. A total of 61 bleeding events occurred, of which 10 were major (upper GI, mouth, rectal, and nose). Major bleeding events required hospitalization of the patient with an average length of stay of 5 days (range 2 to 14 days). Conclusions : Notwithstanding several limitations, the retrospective chart review suggests that there is wide variation in long-term therapy for patients with chronic ITP in Canada. Splenectomy was the most widely used second line therapy, although 18% of the patients were non-responders and the five-year relapse/failure rate was 55%.",
