    "abstract_text": "We studied the immunophenotypic characteristics of 459 consecutive adult AML patients and their correlation with karyotype. Immunophenotype was performed using a panel of 26 directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies. Cytogenetic analysis was performed using a standard G-banding technique. Karyotype was available in 394 patients (not done in 15, failed in 50): 1) 45 (11.4%) were t(15;17) APL patients with a mature myeloid phenotype (HLA-DR-/CD13+ and/or CD33+). CD2 and CD56 were expressed in 20% and 13.3% of cases, respectively. CD11b-positivity was less frequent than in the other cytogenetic groups. The markers significantly associated with t(15;17) were: presence of CD2 (two tailed Fisher exact test: p=.003) and CD117 (p=.01), absence of CD4dim (p90% of blasts, CD34+ in 70%, MPO+ in 95.8% and HLA-DR+ in 89.3%. The association with CD14 and TdT was of borderline statistical significance. 4) 24 (6.1%) had \u22125/5q- with more than 80% of blasts CD117+/CD13+>CD33+. CD34 was positive in 62.9% of cases, CD7 in 33%, CD11b in 35.7%, CD11c in 67.8% and CD14 in 7.1%. CD15-positivity was less frequent than in other AML subtypes. Univariate analysis showed a trend of positive association with CD7 and CD117. 5) 40 (10.2%) showed \u22127/7q-, with CD13+>CD33+ detected in more than 80%, CD7 in 33.3%, CD11b in 72.7%, CD15 in 55%, CD34 in 73.3%. Abnormal CD16/CD33 and/or CD11b/CD66b myeloid cell pattern was detected in 40% of cases (p=.001). \u22127/7q- were significantly associated with CD34 (p=.02) and CD7 (p=.04). 6) 41 (10.4%), had complex karyotype (\u22653 abn) with a similar antigenic profile than group 4) and 5) but with a more frequent expression of CD11b, CD14, CD15 and less frequent of MPO. In univariate analysis CD19 (p=.04), CD34 (p=.02) and MPO (p99%, specificity 94.7%) and CD7/CD11c/CD19/CD56/MPO/HLA-DR (sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 94.5%), respectively. We conclude that in AML patients some cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with peculiar antigenic profiles. In patients with normal karyotype the heterogeneity of antigenic pattern may reflect underlined distinct molecular abnormalities."
