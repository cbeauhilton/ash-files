    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplastic disease of the bone marrow characterized by a malignant transformation of plasma cells. Many patients relapse after initial treatment and require additional therapies. Impaired cell cycle regulation and DNA repair mechanisms as well as exposure to genotoxic drugs leads to accumulation of genomic alterations with progressive disease. Pressure from antineoplastic agents, including novel agents, eventually leads to the selection of resistant clones. Assessing acquired somatic mutations in MM patients can identify key genomic drivers and guide the development of a rational, individualized therapy plan for each patient with advanced disease. Here we report on the mutational landscape of cancer-associated genes in 214 patients who underwent comprehensive genomic profiling. Methods: Review of this data was approved by the UAMS institutional review board. DNA and RNA were extracted from CD138+ selected cells from bone marrow aspirates. Adaptor ligated sequencing libraries from extracted nucleic acids were captured by solution hybridization using bait sets targeting 405 cancer-related and 265 frequently rearranged genes (FoundationOne Heme \u00ae ; Foundation Medicine ). For samples with low cell yield only the DNA portion was performed. All samples were sequenced in a CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory to an average depth >500x. Results We identified 147 clinically relevant alterations with an average of 3 alterations per patient ranging from 1 to 8. The most frequently altered genes were KRAS (29% of cases), NRAS (23%), TP53 (19%), RB1 (10%), BRAF (8%), TRAF3 (8%), CDKN2C (7%), DNMT3A (5%), NF1 , FAF1 and TET2 (4% each). While RAS , RAF , RB1 and TP53 mutations are also found in previously untreated patients, albeit in lower frequencies, mutations of DNTM3A and TET2 are rarely reported in the early phase of the disease, arguing for the accumulation of genomic alterations over time. We found concomitant alterations in KRAS and BRAF in 5, KRAS and NRAS in 3, and NRAS and BRAF in 2 patients. The vast majority of RAS alterations occurred at hotspots resulting in activating alterations at codons 12, 13 or 61 with mutant allele frequencies ranging from 0.01 to 0.92 with an average of 0.30. In the 17 patients with BRAF alterations the hotspot mutation V600E was found in 7 with mutant allele frequencies ranging from 0.01 to 0.48 with an average of 0.32. Overall the MAPK pathway was affected in 128 of 214 patients. 61 patients had alterations of genes associated with DNA damage repair. Among the 10 patients with DNMT3A alterations 2 also had alterations of TET2 suggesting significant epigenetic deregulation in a subset of patients. Data on subclonal structure and correlation of mutation status with paired gene expression profiles will be presented as well, as will be selected responses of patients treated on the basis of these results. Conclusion Subjecting CD138 selected bone marrow cells to comprehensive genomic profiling allows for the identification of clinically relevant alterations, which deregulate critical pathways in multiple myeloma. Small molecule inhibitors that target key genes in these affected pathways ( MEK , BRAF ) have recently been approved for therapy in other cancers or are being actively developed ( PI3K, AKT, PARP ). This comprehensive genomic characterization allows rational development of individualized clinical strategies using molecular targets for MM patients who are refractory to standard of care therapies.
