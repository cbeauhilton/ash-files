    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The use of high-dose post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY) has revolutionized graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis and allowed to successfully reconsider haplotransplant in recent years. As this strategy significantly reduces the incidence of both acute and chronic GVHD, PTCY has been thereafter considered not only in matched settings but also as sole GVHD prophylaxis, at least when considering myeloablative allotransplant using matched sibling (MSD) or unrelated (MUD) donors and bone marrow as source of graft. Here, PTCY, as a sole GVHD prophylaxis, was tested in a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) setting, using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) as source of graft considering that this platform is currently broadly used worldwide in adults. Methods: This prospective monocentric phase 2 study was designed with the main objective to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of using only PTCY (without cyclosporine A nor mycophenolate mofetyl after transplant) in adults (18-70 years old) eligible for a RIC PBSC transplant with MSD or MUD. The Baltimore platform with 2 days of PTCY 50mg/kg/day on days 3 and 4 post infusion was considered as conditioning regimen, using fludarabine for lymphoid disease or clofarabine for myeloid disease. The primary objective was to appreciate the incidence of corticosteroid-resistant acute grade 3-4 GVHD (CR 3-4 GVHD) within 100 days post-transplant. According to statistical rules, patients have to be included in a step by step fashion (3, 3, 6, 15, 15 and 17 patients) for a total of 59 evaluable patients (meaning having received PTCY), in order to stop the protocol soon enough in case of excessive rate of deleterious severe acute GVHD (graded according to Mount Sinai International Consortium). Thus, the trial had to be stopped in case of documentation of > 2 CR 3-4 GVHD for the first 3 patients, >3 CR 3-4 GVHD for the first 6 patients, > 4 CR 3-4 GVHD for the first 12 patients, > 6 3-4 CR GVHD for the first 27 patients, > 8 CR 3-4 GVHD for the first 42 patients and finally as soon as > 9 CR 3-4 GVHD for the last included patients. All patients gave informed consent. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03263767. Results: The results of the first 27 first patients (males n=17 and female n=10; median age: 59 years old (yo), range: 26-70) are reported here. They were included between February 2018 and November 2020. Diagnoses were AML (N=8), MDS (N=5), CMML (N=2), myelofibrosis (N=5), CML (N=1), DLBCL (N=1), T-cell lymphoma (N=1), Philadelphia positive B-ALL (N=1), CLL (N=1), lymphoblastic lymphoma (N=1) and mixed phenotype acute leukemia (N=1). Donors were MSD in 10 cases and MUD in 17. Only one primary graft failure was documented in a 61 yo MDS patient with active disease at transplant. He is however still alive in response after autologous reconstitution. With a median follow-up of 17.6 months (range: 10-42) for alive patients at the time of analysis (July 2021), 1-year and 2-year survivals were 80.9+7% and 74.7+9%, respectively, for both OS et DFS. GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS) at 1-year and 2-year was 58.7+9% and 52.2+10%, respectively. Three relapses (11%) and 6 deaths occurred. Deaths were due to acute GVHD in 4 patients (including 1 with sepsis and 1 with SARS-COVID 19 infection) and relapse in 2. Grade 2, 3 and 4 acute GVHD occurred in 11, 1 and 4 patients, respectively, for a total of 59% of grade 2-4 acute GVHD. CR 3-4 GVHD was observed in all of 5 patients with acute grade 3-4 GVHD and 4 died related to GVHD. Moderate/severe chronic GVHD occurred in 5/22 (22.7%) evaluable patients, including 4 still on immunosuppressive therapy at 40, 28, 25 and 16 months post-transplant. Overall non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 14.8% and related to acute GVHD. However, the number of cases conducting to stop the protocol was not reached. Conclusion: PTCY as a sole GVHD prophylaxis is here demonstrated as possible and relatively safe for adults receiving a matched PBSC Baltimore-based RIC allograft. The very good survivals reported here may be related to a strong GVL effect associated with the high incidence of acute GVHD. However, because of this high incidence and the fact that NRM was related to GVHD after this first analysis, we have now made an amendment to test the addition to PTCY of one day of anti-thymoglobulin (ATG) 2.5 mg/kg on day-2 for the next 32 patients to be included. This second cohort receiving PTCY+ATG as a sole prophylaxis is ongoing.
