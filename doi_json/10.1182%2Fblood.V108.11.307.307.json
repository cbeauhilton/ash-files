    "abstract_text": "T-cell depletion of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell graft (HSCT) represents the most powerful approach to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), thus allowing to overcome HLA barriers in patients with high risk malignancies, lacking a conventional donor. We hypothesized that early add-back of suicide-gene transduced donor lymphocytes (TK cells) to leukemic patients undergoing haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT) could provide early immune-reconstitution and selective control of GvHD. In a phase II clinical trial (protocol MMTK007), 17 of 29 enrolled pts, (median age 52), received add-backs of 10^7/kg TK cells 42 days after haplo-HSCT. TK cells engraftment, observed in 14 patients, was necessary and sufficient for a rapid and effective immunereconstitution (IR), with a median of 144 (101\u2013336) CD3+, 59 (28\u2013149) CD4+ and 86 (52\u2013279) CD8+ cells/mcl at day 100 after HSCT. Accordingly, engraftment of TK cells was tightly correlated with clinical outcome: while 3/3 pts who failed TK cells engraftment died of infections, only 1/14 TK engrafted patients died from infections (last event at day +166). As shown in Table I, the immune repertoire of treated patients improved significantly at 6 months post transplant and normalized completely in 12 months. High numbers of T cell precursors specific for CMV and EBV were detected at immune reconstitution (median of 86 and 69 gIFN specific spots/10^5 PBMC respectively) and predicted subsequent freedom from viral reactivation (p=0.002). Six pts developed acute (GvHD), (grade I to IV) that was always completely abrogated by the suicide system. Overall survival of TK cells treated patients is 50% at three years. These results indicate that TK-DLI abolish late mortality after CD34+ haplo-SCT in adults. A phase III multicentric study will start in 2007 to validate prospectively the advantage of TK-DLI in haplo-SCT."
