    "abstract_text": "Administration of colony-stimulating factors (CSF) after autologous peripheral-blood progenitor cell transplantation is the current standard of care, and G-CSF is usually given from day +5 or +7 until engraftment. Recent preliminary data in a non-transplant setting suggest that 2 doses of G-CSF may be equivalent to the standard schedule. In this pilot study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of giving only 2 doses of filgrastim post-transplant (days +7 and +9) in non-myeloma pts; exclusion criteria were re-transplants and clinical instability at day +7. From July 07 to June 08, 19 consecutive pts were included (16 lymphomas, 3 acute leukaemias) and their outcome was compared to a historical control group of 42 similar pts transplanted from Jan 06 to Jun 07, who received filgrastim from d+7 until 1000 neutrophils/ul (4\u201318 days, median 9). There were no significant differences in primary endpoints: median time to neutrophil engraftment (500/ul reached on day +12 vs +11) rate of documented infections (with bacteremia in 23% of transplants in the study group vs 36% in the control group) and median length of hospitalisation (both 22 days). Median duration of intravenous antibiotics (11 vs 12 days) median time to platelet engraftment (20,000/ul reached on day +13 vs +14) incidence of grade 3/4 mucositis and transfusion requirements were also similar. There were no deaths at day +30 in the study group. In 2 of the 19 pts a secondary prescription of filgrastim was made (for 2 and 4 days). In this pilot study, reducing filgrastim administration to 2 doses seems possible without undue risks. If confirmed in a randomized trial, these findings could have a significant impact on the cost of transplantation.",
