    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Myositis is a rare manifestation of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). We present 4 cases of myositis as a manifestation of cGVHD and a review of the seven cases published in the literature (Tables 1-2). Out of the 340 allogeneic transplants done in our institution over the past 12 years, four (1.17%) cases of myositis-like GVHD have been identified. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients treated at the blood cancer center. Results: Four patients, ages 27 to 51 years, were identified. Two of the patients had an associated rash, leading to a diagnosis of dermatomyositis. In our cohort, patients developed symptoms over seven months to 8.6 years post-transplant. Seventy-five percent were female, and none of them had original diagnoses of leukemia. Two were histopathologically diagnosed and the peak CPK was 71,000 U/L, the highest reported in the literature. Discussion: Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are idiopathic inflammatory myopathies characterized by proximal skeletal muscle weakness and inflammation. They should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with fatigue, muscle pain, and weakness with or without a rash. These conditions can affect patients' quality of life and in severe cases, if they involve respiratory muscles, can be potentially lethal.
