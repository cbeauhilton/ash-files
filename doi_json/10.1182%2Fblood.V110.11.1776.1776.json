    "abstract_text": "Within the erythroid lineage, erythropoietin (EPO) responsiveness is manifested by cell division and growth as well as specific changes in heme and globin production that ultimately result in the production of erythrocytes. However, the nascent relationship between EPO-associated mitosis and globin gene regulation has not been fully defined. In this study, cultured adult human CD34+ cells from peripheral blood were used to investigate early cellular responses to erythropoietin in the context of mitosis. Matched cultures were performed in replicate using human cells from at least two healthy adults. To detect mitosis, one million cells were labeled with 2uM carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinamidyl ester (CFSE). The CFSE-labeled cells were then cultured in the presence [EPO(+)] or absence [EPO(\u2212)] of 4U/mL EPO, and analyzed using flow cytometry. No cell divisions were detected in either condition during the first 24 hours in culture, and multiple cell divisions were noted on subsequent culture days only in the EPO(+) cultures. Remarkably, dual-staining with CFSE and CD71 revealed a small (90% of those cells. These novel results suggest that the frequency and levels of gamma-globin transcripts are quite low at the earliest stages of an EPO response among adult human CD34+ cells. However, it is clearly demonstrated that the cells can increase their capacity to import iron and transcribe beta-globin mRNA at very high levels prior to their first EPO-dependent cell division.",
