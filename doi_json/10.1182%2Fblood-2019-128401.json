    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after hematopoietic cell transplant or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, or those who are ineligible for such therapies, need more treatment options. Loncastuximab tesirine (ADCT-402; Lonca) is an antibody\u2010drug conjugate (ADC) comprising a humanized antibody directed against human CD19 conjugated to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer toxin. Its target, the human CD19 antigen, is a classic B-cell marker expressed at normal-to-high levels on the majority of malignant B-cells. Preliminary data from a Phase 1 dose\u2010escalation and dose-expansion trial of Lonca in R/R B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma showed significant clinical activity in DLBCL, with an acceptable safety profile, and the recommended Phase 2 dose of 150 \u03bcg/kg was identified. Here, we present the planned interim analysis for futility on the first 52 pts with R/R DLBCL treated with Lonca in Phase 2. Methods: This single-arm, multi-center, open-label, two-stage, Phase 2 trial is currently enrolling pts \u226518 years of age with R/R DLBCL following \u22652 multi-agent systemic treatment regimens and without bulky disease (tumor \u226510 cm). The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of single-agent Lonca by overall response rate (ORR). The secondary objectives are to further evaluate efficacy (including duration of response [DOR], progression-free survival [PFS], and overall survival [OS]), to characterize the safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity profile of Lonca, and to evaluate the impact of Lonca on health-related quality-of-life. Pts received 30-minute intravenous infusions of Lonca once every 3 weeks (1 cycle) at a dose of 150 \u03bcg/kg for the first 2 cycles, then 75 \u03bcg/kg for subsequent cycles, for up to 1 year or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria, whichever occurs first. A preplanned interim analysis for futility was conducted when the 52 nd pt would have had 2 tumor assessments (approximately 12 weeks after the start of study drug), with the study planned to proceed to full enrollment if \u226510 of the first 52 pts responded to Lonca. ORR (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) was determined by an independent reviewer. Results: 52 pts with DLBCL were included in the interim analysis. Pts had a median age of 62.5 years [range 24-84] and had received a median of 3 previous therapies (range 2-7; Table 1 ). As of the data cut-off of May 01, 2019, pts had received a median of 2.5 (range 1-9) cycles of Lonca. ORR among the futility analysis population (52) was 44.2%, meeting futility requirements. A total of 10/52 (19.2%) and 13/52 (25.0%) pts attained CR and PR, respectively. In addition, 11 pts (21.2%) had stable disease ( Figure 1 ). All (100%) pts had at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), and 37 (71.2%) pts had grade \u22653 TEAEs. The most common all-grade non-hematological TEAEs, regardless of relationship to study treatment, were gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) increase (24 [46.2%]), pyrexia (18 [34.6%]) and hypokalemia (15 [28.8%]); pleural effusions and peripheral edema were reported in 5/52 pts (9.6%) and 6/52 pts (11.5%), respectively; 1 of these pts had a grade \u22653 event (pleural effusion). The most common grade \u22653 TEAEs were GGT increase (11 [21.2%]), hypercalcemia (4 [7.7%]) and hypokalemia (3 [5.8%]). No grade \u22653 skin-related TEAEs have been reported. The most common all-grade hematological abnormalities were platelet count decreased* (34 [65.4%]), neutrophil count decreased* (27 [51.9%]) and anemia (14 [26.9%]), and the most common grade \u22653 hematological abnormalities were neutrophil count decreased* (15 [28.8%]), platelet count decreased* (10 [19.2%]) and anemia (6 [11.5%]). Overall, 26 (50%) pts had TEAEs leading to dose reductions/delays and 10 (19.2%) pts had TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation. Conclusions : Lonca has demonstrated encouraging single-agent anti-tumor activity and manageable toxicity in pts with R/R DLBCL. Futility requirements were met and pts are now enrolling in stage 2 of the trial. Updated efficacy results will be presented at the meeting. *Laboratory abnormality data are reported for platelet count decreased and neutrophil count decreased to avoid under-reporting of these events.
