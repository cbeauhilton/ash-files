    "abstract_text": "Background: Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) have been the main stay of oral anticoagulation (OAC) in pediatrics. However, VKA have multiple challenges. The pharmacological properties of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) suggest that they may have advantages particularly for children. The off-label use of DOACs is however on the rise within the pediatric population. The increasingly broad and varied use of DOACs, lack of published clinical guidance, and limited data on reversal strategies have created the imperative to identify strategies for OAC reversal in pediatrics. We conducted an online survey for strategies used for oral anticoagulants reversal in pediatrics. Study Design: Institutional review board approval was obtained and an online survey was developed using the RedCap. The survey was electronically distributed by International Society of Hemostasis and Thrombosis (ISTH) to its Pediatric/Neonatal Thrombosis and Hemostasis Subcommittee group members. The survey questions asked approach to common hypothetical clinical scenarios for OAC reversal.The data were analysed descriptively. Results: There were 76 respondents, majority from academic free-standing Children'sHospitals. Seventy-two percent reported having a hemostasis-thrombosis/anticoagulation service but only 29 % have a dedicated anticoagulation pharmacist. Approximately 40% do not have a formal protocol in place for VKA reversal. For a supra-therapeutic INR (INR > 5) in a non-bleeding patient, 95% opted to manage by omitting the next dose of VKA while 18 % opted to give oral vitamin K alone or comitantly. For clinically relevant non-major bleeding, majority indicated using Vitamin K; oral (51%) or IV (37). For major bleeding on VKA, majority use either a combination of 4F-PCC and IV Vitamin K or plasma and IV Vitamin K (44/76 and 26/76 respectively). The presence of bleeding seemed to be the major driver for the choice of route (enteral versus parenteral) for Vitamin K for VKA reversal. Thirty-six of the 76 respondents indicated using DOACs; 94% used FXa inhibitors and 1/3 use dabigatran in their clinical practice. For non-urgent DOAC reversal, 97% indicated omitting the next dose. For non-major bleeding on DOAC, majority (29/36) indicated omitting the next dose/doses, some chose 4F-PCC (8/36) and only a few indicated use of specific reversal agents (3/36 and 1/36 for Dabigatran and Andexanet respectively). For major bleeding while on DOACs, the use of specific reversal agents (11/35, 6/35 for Andexanet and idarucizumab respectively) followed by 4F-PCC (9/35) was the major intervention indicated. Dilute thrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were the most commonly utilized tests to measure residual dabigatran activity. For Factor Xa inhibitors routine heparin assay rather than DOAC calibrated anti-Xa activity is utilized by most of the responders to assess presence of the plasma drug activity. Conclusion: Practices for oral anticoagulants reversal vary substantially in the pediatric population. Plasma is still used for urgent VKA reversal in many pediatric centers. The off-label use of DOACs in children is on the rise. Our results highlight the need for further studies to standardize OAC reversal in children.
