    "abstract_text": "The Fcgamma receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) are a family of molecules that modulate immune responses. Fc\u03b3RIIb is an inhibitory Fc\u03b3R that bears immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs which transduce inhibitory signals on coligation with the surface membrane Ig of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR). The role of Fc\u03b3RIIb in controlling B cell activation through inhibition of BCR signaling has been extensively studied in animal models. Nevertheless, data on Fc\u03b3RIIb are scant in human normal and neoplastic B cells, this being due to the lack of a specific antibody for human Fc\u03b3RIIb. Consequently, there is little information on this receptor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Considering the activated nature of CLL cells and the central role of the BCR in the biology of the disease, studies of Fc\u03b3Rs are warranted. We used a novel specific mAb directly conjugated with Alexa 488 fluorophore that solely reacts with the human Fc\u03b3RIIb (MacroGenics, Inc.) to investigate the receptors expression on CLL and normal human B cells. The study population included 84 patients with CLL and 24 age- and sex-matched controls. Fc\u03b3RIIb expression was assessed as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of surface membrane staining. In CLL cells, Fc\u03b3RIIb was measured on CD19 + CD5 + cells in combination with CD38, CD49d or CD69. Normal B cells were immunostained for CD19, CD5, IgD and CD38 expression and B cell subsets: nai\u0308ve (IgD + CD38 \u2212 ), activated (IgD + CD38 + ) and memory B cells (IgD \u2212 CD38 \u2212 ) were studied for their relative expression of Fc\u03b3RIIb. Fc\u03b3RIIb expression was found significantly higher in nai\u0308ve B cells compared to activated and memory B cells [median MFI: 17420 (11960\u201321180) vs. 11.140 (7899\u201316970) and 11.830 (6984\u201317100); p<0.001]. Significant differences were also observed between CD5 \u2212 and CD5 + normal B cells. In contrast, Fc\u03b3RIIb expression was lower in CLL cells than in CD5 + and CD5 \u2212 normal B lymphocytes [median MFI: 6901(1034\u201342600), 10180 (5856\u201314820) and 12120 (7776\u201316040); p<0.05)]. Interestingly, Fc\u03b3RIIb expression was variable within individual CLL clones, this being higher in CD38 + and CD49d + cells than in CD38 \u2212 and CD49d \u2212 cells (p<0.05). Furthermore, the highest density of Fc\u03b3RIIb was observed on those cells which coexpressed CD38 and CD49d. In contrast, no significant differences were observed between Fc\u03b3RIIb and the expression of the activation antigen CD69. Although CD69 and CD38 expression was significantly higher on unmutated IGHV cases, no correlation was found between Fc\u03b3RIIb levels and IGHV mutational status. Similarly, there was no correlation between Fc\u03b3RIIb and other poor prognostic variables such as ZAP-70 (\u226520%), CD38 (\u2265 30%) or high risk cytogenetics. Nevertheless, cases with \u2265 30% CD49d + cells had higher Fc\u03b3RIIb expression than those with <30% CD49d + cells (p=0.006). The findings presented in this study suggest a hierarchy of Fc\u03b3RIIb expression in normal B-cells, CLL cells and their subpopulations: circulating normal CD5 \u2212 B cells > circulating normal CD5 + B cells > circulating CD5 + CLL B cells. In addition, although Fc\u03b3RIIb is present on all normal B cell subsets its expression is higher in nai\u0308ve B cells. Furthermore, in CLL Fc\u03b3RIIb density is greater in CD38 + and CD49d + cells within the clone. Although CD49d and Fc\u03b3RIIb on CLL clones is linked in a direct manner, there is no relationship with Fc\u03b3RIIb density and IGHV mutations, ZAP-70, CD38 and unfavorable cytogenetic markers. Finally, the relationship between Fc\u03b3RIIb expression on CLL cells and functional responses to BCR and other receptor-mediated signals deserve further investigation.",
