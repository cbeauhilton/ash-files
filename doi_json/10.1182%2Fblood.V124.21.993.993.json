    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT : The nucleophosmin-1 ( NPM1 ) mutation represents the most common genetic lesion (30-35%) in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the mutation resulting in the cytoplasmic delocalization of the NPM protein (NPMc+, most commonly mutation type A, c.860_863dupTCTG). Outside of conventional chemotherapy, treatment options for those with relapsed disease are extremely limited. We have previously discovered that leukemic cells expressing NPMc+ are preferentially sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the first generation proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, as result of the induction of superoxide in these cells (Huang M, et al., Leukemia , 2013). However, bortezomib has demonstrated only modest anti-leukemic activity as a single agent in early phase clinical trials that have included primarily heavily pretreated patients not stratified according to mutational genotype. In addition, the high incidence of clinically significant peripheral neuropathy in these studies led to early discontinuation of treatment. MLN9708 (Ixazomib) is a novel second generation proteasome inhibitor that is orally bioavailable and has shown promising activity and improved tolerability in early phase clinical trials in lymphoma and in multiple myeloma, where it is currently in a Phase III clinical trial. The efficacy of MLN9708 in relapsed patients with AML has not yet been examined. We have investigated the in vitro effects of MLN9708 on the cytotoxicity, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cellular glutathione in both cultured NPMc+ AML cell lines and primary leukemic samples. Cultured OCI-AML3 cells (human AML cell line featuring the NPMc+ mutation) were approximately 50-fold more sensitive to MLN9708 with a mean half inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 \u00b1 SD ) of 67 nM \u00b1 1.83 nM at 24 hours than were an AML cell line (THP-1) expressing wild type NPM1 . Knockdown of both NPM1/NPMc+ by inducible NPM1 shRNA expression significantly attenuated the MLN9708-mediated cytotoxicity, as determined by MTS colorimetric and flow cytometric apoptosis assays. As with bortezomib, MLN9708 treatment at 75 nM induced a 2.1-fold (p < 0.002) increase in superoxide-specific DHE (PE)-derived fluorescence as compared to controls. Pre-incubation of cells with 25 mM N-acetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger, dramatically reduced cytotoxicity, strongly implicating the generation of ROS in the mechanism of MLN9708-induced cytotoxicity. Knockdown of NPM1/ NPMc+ expression resulted in an increase of glutathione levels of 2.6-fold (p < 0.04) in untreated cells, and 2.3-fold (p < 0.005 ) and 2.9-fold (p < 0.004) after a 22 hour incubation with MLN9708 at pharmacologically achievable doses of 75 nM and 150 nM, respectively ( Figure 1  ). In addition, a concomitant 4-fold reduction (p < 0.04) in the NADP+/NADPH ratio was observed in the NPM1/NPMc+ depleted OCI-AML3 cells. In vitro apoptosis assays of primary leukemic blasts isolated from five patients with relapsed NPMc+ AML showed an IC 50 for MLN9708 ranging from 49.963-467.487nM (183.8 nM \u00b1 176.8 nM). Based on these promising in vitro studies, a Phase 2 clinical trial of single-agent oral MLN9708 (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02030405) has been initiated for patients with relapsed or refractory NPMc+ AML. We conclude that the expression of NPMc+ renders AML cells more susceptible to MLN9708 toxicity and that this effect results at least in part from the generation of superoxide. Lower glutathione levels in NPMc+ expressing cells suggests an underlying defect in the antioxidant defense pathway. Demonstration of the sensitivity of NPMc+ AML cells to MLN9708 as a single agent may serve as a platform for the development of novel combination strategies with this drug.
