    "abstract_text": "Introduction: \u03b2-thalassemia is an inherited hemoglobinopathy associated with an erythroid maturation defect characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and impaired RBC maturation. Luspatercept is a first-in-class erythroid maturation agent under development to treat patients with \u03b2-thalassemia. Luspatercept binds to select TGF\u03b2 superfamily ligands to reduce aberrant Smad2/3 signaling and enhance late-stage erythropoiesis (Suragani RN, et al. Nat Med . 2014;20:408-14). We report the results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the efficacy and safety of luspatercept in adult \u03b2-thalassemia patients requiring regular RBC transfusions. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02604433. Methods: Eligible patients were aged \u2265 18 years; had \u03b2-thalassemia or hemoglobin (Hb) E/\u03b2-thalassemia (compound \u03b2-thalassemia mutation and/or multiplication of \u03b1-globin genes was allowed); and required regular transfusions of 6-20 RBC units in the 24 weeks prior to randomization with no transfusion-free period \u2265 35 days during that time. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either luspatercept, at a starting dose level of 1.0 mg/kg with titration up to 1.25 mg/kg, or placebo, subcutaneously every 3 weeks for \u2265 48 weeks. Patients in both treatment arms continued to receive RBC transfusions and iron chelation therapy to maintain the same baseline Hb level. The primary endpoint was a \u2265 33% reduction in transfusion burden (with a reduction of \u2265 2 RBC units) during weeks 13-24, when compared with a 12-week baseline period. Key secondary endpoints included: \u2265 33% reduction in RBC transfusion burden at weeks 37-48, \u2265 50% reduction in transfusion burden at weeks 13-24, \u2265 50% reduction in transfusion burden at weeks 37-48, and mean change in transfusion burden at weeks 13-24. Achievement of \u2265 33% reduction in RBC transfusion burden over any consecutive 12 weeks on study was also evaluated. Results: \u2020 A total of 336 patients were randomized, of whom 332 were treated. Median age was 30 years (range 18-66) and 58% of patients were female. Patients received a median of 6 RBC units in the 12 weeks prior to treatment. 58% of patients in each arm had undergone splenectomy. B 0 /B 0 genotype (classification according to the HbVar database) was observed in 68 of 224 (30.4%) and 35 of 112 (31.3%) patients in the luspatercept and placebo arms, respectively. 48 of 224 (21.4%) patients in the luspatercept arm achieved the primary endpoint versus 5 of 112 (4.5%) patients receiving placebo (odds ratio 5.79, P < 0.0001). 44 of 224 (19.6%) patients receiving luspatercept achieved a \u2265 33% reduction in RBC transfusion burden at weeks 37-48 compared with 4 of 112 (3.6%) patients receiving placebo ( P < 0.0001). Of 224 patients receiving luspatercept, 17 (7.6%) and 23 (10.3%) achieved a \u2265 50% reduction in RBC transfusion burden at weeks 13-24 and 37-48, respectively, compared with 2 (1.8%) and 1 of 112 (0.9%) patients receiving placebo ( P = 0.0303 and P = 0.0017, respectively). The difference of mean change from baseline in transfusion burden from week 13 to week 24 was 1.35 units ( P < 0.0001). 158 of 224 (70.5%) patients receiving luspatercept achieved a \u2265 33% RBC transfusion reduction over any consecutive 12 weeks compared with 33 of 112 (29.5%) patients receiving placebo ( P < 0.0001); statistically significant differences were also noted for all other transfusion burden reduction endpoints. Adverse events (AEs) observed in the study were generally consistent with previously reported phase 2 data. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to dose delay or dose reduction were similar between treatment arms. No patient deaths were reported for those treated with luspatercept. Conclusions: Treatment with luspatercept resulted in significant reductions in RBC transfusion burden in adults with transfusion-dependent \u03b2-thalassemia. Luspatercept was generally well tolerated in this patient population. \u2020 As of May 11, 2018, cutoff date.
