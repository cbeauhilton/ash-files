    "abstract_text": "Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the risk of HBV reactivation in HBsAg-positive or negative, HBcAb-positive patients with aplastic anemia (AA) receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Methods: We analyzed clinical data of 60 AA patients with HBV infection out of 201 cases. Entecavir or lamivudine therapy was initiated if HBV reactivation was encountered, or used as antiviral prophylaxis regimen for HBsAg-positive patients. Result: Among 60 AA patients, 12 were chronically infected and 48 were previously exposed. There was no difference in clinical features in AA patients with or without HBV infection. The prevalence of non-severe AA (NSAA) progressed to severe AA (SAA) was similar in two groups (35.6% vs 42.7%, p=1.0). In NSAA group, the response rate to CsA, to ATG and CsA, and progression to SAA were similar in patients with or without HBV infection (35.7% vs 35.3%, p>0.05; 42.8% vs 58.8%, p= 1.0; 35.5% vs 42.7%, p= 0.414). In SAA group, patients with or without HBV infection responded to ATG and CsA therapy similarly (83.33% vs 59.0%, p = 0.252). HBV reactivation was occurred in all 5 HBsAg positive patients without any antiviral therapy, while no HBV reactivation happened in other 7 patients received antiviral therapy. Disease course (RR=1.012, p=0.036) and absolute reticulocyte count (RR=11.556, P=0.025) were the risk factors for HBV reactivation by univariate analysis. Logistic regression indicated that HBsAg positivity without preventive therapy was the only strong factor for HBV reactivation. Conclusion: Antiviral prophylaxis is recommended for HBsAg-positive patients with AA who will receive IST because of high rate of HBV reactivation. HBV infection has no influence on the clinic course of AA, and antiviral therapy does not affect the efficacy of IST. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
