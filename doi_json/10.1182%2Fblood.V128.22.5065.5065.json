    "abstract_text": "Background In patients with acute leukemia the stromal microenvironment is deeply modified. Disturbances in signaling pathways, genetic abnormalities and functional changes in mesenchymal cells of these patients have been previously described. Chemotherapy also affect stromal progenitor cells. A damaged microenvironment might impair hematopoiesis in acute leukemia patients. Aims To investigate the relative expression level in MMSCs and CFU-Fs, derived from the bone marrow (BM) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients before and over the course of chemotherapy. Methods 54 newly diagnosed cases (33 AML, 21 ALL) were involved in the study after informed consent. BM was aspirated prior to any treatment (time-point 0) and at days 37, 100 and 180 since the beginning of treatment of acute leukemia. MMSCs were cultured in aMEM with 10% fetal calf serum, CFU-Fs, in aMEM with 20% fetal calf serum. The relative expression level (REL) of different genes was measured by TaqMan RQ-PCR. As a control MMSCs and CFU-Fs from 88 healthy donors were used. Results At the time of the disease manifestation the analysis of gene expression in MMSCs from acute leukemia patients revealed a significant increase in the REL of genes which regulate immune system responses and thereby can influence on the leukemic cell proliferation and migration ( IL-6, IL-8, IL-1b and IL-1R1 ) (Pic.1). Also at the time of the diagnosis an increase in REL of genes, that are responsible for hematopoiesis regulation, was observed. For example, the REL of CSF1 that can influence on leukemic cells proliferation was increased at the disease manifestation and became normal during the treatment. The same dynamics was observed in the REL of JAG1 that has an antiapoptotic effect on leukemic cells. The REL of LIF had been also significantly increased at the disease manifestation, reflecting the efforts of MMSCs to inhibit leukemic proliferation. Chemotherapy affected REL of the studied genes differently. The treatment lead to the downregulation of IGF , TGFB1 and TGFB2 (Pic.2). As far asTGFB1 and 2 inhibit the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, and IGF is associated with myelodysplastic changes in elderly bone marrow, so their downregulation may refer to the effectiveness of therapy. The REL of genes regulating MMSC proliferation ( PDGFRa and PDGFRb, FGF2, FGFR1 and 2 ) increased during chemotherapy. Exploring cell adhesion molecules, the decrease in the REL of their encoding genes was observed. As far as VCAM facilitate the leukemic cell extravasation and ICAM was shown to depress the Th17 cell differentiation, the down-regulation of their genes may reflect the microenvironment restoration. The influence of chemotherapy lead to decrease in REL of genes, associated with MMSCs differentiation ( BGLAP and SOX9 (Pic.3)), reflecting the mechanism of the blocking of MMSCs migration and differentiation under the stress conditions. The alterations of bone marrow stroma were more pronounced in patients who didn't achieve remission. The REL of 9 genes was studied in CFU-F colonies. There were no differences in gene expression in CFU-Fs before the treatment, except for an increase in the REL of PPARg in acute leukemia CFU-Fs. During the treatment, a decrease in the REL of SPP1 and an increase in the REL of FGFR1 and 2 were observed. Conclusion Therefore, chemotherapy used does not impair the functional ability of MMSCs and CFU-Fs, but influence on their gene expression profile. The two types of precursors are affected differently, indicating their different differentiation level and functions.
