    "abstract_text": "Background VOD/SOS is an unpredictable, potentially life-threatening complication of conditioning regimens for HSCT or chemotherapy without HSCT. VOD/SOS with multi-organ dysfunction (MOD) may be associated with >80% mortality. One center with a primarily adult population (median age = 35.8 [range: 4-67] years), reported a Day +100 mortality rate of 79% in patients with unresolved severe VOD/SOS. For adult and pediatric patients, defibrotide is approved to treat hepatic VOD/SOS with renal or pulmonary dysfunction post-HSCT in the United States (US) and to treat severe hepatic VOD/SOS post-HSCT in the European Union. The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) notes that clinical presentation of VOD/SOS differs between adult and pediatric patients, but most published results describe mixed age populations. Day +100 survival results specific to adults receiving defibrotide 25 mg/kg/day include those of a phase 2 dose-finding trial (33%, n=52) and a compassionate-use study (46.3%, n=141). Here, we report final adult subgroup outcomes data from the defibrotide expanded-access (T-IND) program, the largest prospective evaluation of defibrotide. Methods The T-IND was a multicenter, single-arm study designed to provide access to defibrotide prior to US approval. The original protocol required VOD/SOS diagnosis by Baltimore criteria or biopsy post-HSCT, with evidence of MOD (renal/pulmonary dysfunction). The study was amended to include patients without MOD (off-label), with VOD/SOS per modified Seattle criteria, or VOD/SOS following chemotherapy without HSCT (off-label). Defibrotide treatment (25 mg/kg/day) was recommended \u226521 days. Day +100 survival was analyzed for all adults, subgroups with and without MOD, and post hoc with VOD/SOS onset after Day +21 (ie, late-onset, per EBMT proposed criteria for adults). A post hoc exploratory analysis examined the relationship between Day +100 survival and time from VOD/SOS diagnosis to start of defibrotide treatment and included a trend test for treatment initiated on particular days post-diagnosis (Cochran-Armitage trend test). Results Of 1000 patients with VOD/SOS post-HSCT who enrolled in the T-IND study through April 2016 and received \u22651 dose of defibrotide, there were 430 adult patients: 231 had MOD and 199 did not. Median age at HSCT was 42.0 years (MOD subgroup, 41.0 years; no MOD subgroup, 43.0 years). Most common primary diseases were acute myelogenous leukemia (34.7%; MOD, 38.1%; no MOD, 30.7%) acute lymphocytic leukemia (22.1%; MOD, 20.8%; no MOD, 23.6%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (8.4%; MOD, 6.5%; no MOD, 10.6%), and myelodysplastic syndrome (7.0%; MOD, 7.8%; no MOD, 6.0%). Most common graft-vs-host disease prophylaxes were tacrolimus (69.5%; MOD, 70.1%; no MOD, 68.8%), methotrexate (42.6%; MOD, 43.7%; no MOD, 41.2%), sirolimus (17.0%; MOD, 20.3%; no MOD, 13.1%), and cyclosporine (14.9%; MOD, 16.5%; no MOD, 13.1%). Characteristics were generally similar in the 169-patient late-onset subgroup (MOD, n=88; no MOD, n=81). Kaplan-Meier estimated Day +100 survival was similar between all adults post-HSCT (47.1% [39.0% for patients with MOD]) and the late-onset adult subgroup (48.7% [43.0% for patients with MOD]; Figure ). Exploratory post hoc analysis in the adult patient subset found that earlier defibrotide initiation post-VOD/SOS diagnosis was associated with higher Day +100 survival; however, the P value was not significant ( P =0.055) Of the 430 adult patients, adverse events (AEs) occurred in 77.9%, with treatment-related AEs in 20.5% ( Table ). Most common (>2%) treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were gastrointestinal hemorrhage and epistaxis (3.5% each), pulmonary hemorrhage (2.3%), and hematuria and hypotension (2.1% each); most common (>1%) TRAEs leading to discontinuation were gastrointestinal hemorrhage (2.3%) and pulmonary hemorrhage (1.6%). No TRAEs led to death in \u22651%. In general, the safety profile was consistent for patients with late-onset VOD/SOS. Conclusion Final results from the T-IND present data from the largest adult VOD/SOS population (with or without MOD and with or without late-onset VOD/SOS) treated with defibrotide. The survival rate in adults with VOD/SOS post-HSCT is consistent with prior results for adults receiving defibrotide, and no new safety signals were observed. Support: Jazz Pharmaceuticals.
