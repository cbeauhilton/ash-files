    "abstract_text": "Abstract 58 Introduction: Role of small non-coding microRNAs (miRNA) in hematopoiesis has been recently established by studies demonstrating increased levels of miR-155 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (Fulci 2007, Marton 2008). PU.1 is an ETS family transcription factor controling myelo-lymphoid differentiation and is directly negatively regulated by miR-155 (Vigorito 2007). Our aim of this study is to determine mechanisms of miR-155 upregulation in CLL pathogenesis and the role of PU.1 downregulation in the process. Methods : miRNA and mRNA levels were determined by qPCR and Affymetrix mRNA expression profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in purified B cells. Control (N=13) and CLL patients (N=66) were studied. All patients were subgrouped according to cytogenetics (FISH) and Rai status. Protein-DNA localization assays were done using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Results : miR-155 is significantly upregulated in both CLL patient PBMCs and a subset of sorted B-cells whereas PU.1 and its target genes are repressed in all CLL subgroups. Indeed, expression profiling analysis of CLL samples identified a broad repression of \u223c80 miR-155 targets (among them key transcriptional regulators FOS, SATB1, MEF2A, MYBL1, SIRT1, MECP2 and CEBPB) and \u223c380 repressed PU.1 target genes, among them regulators of hematopoietic homeostasis (FOS, CSF1R, CSF2R, IL4R, IL21R) and apoptosis (BID, BIRC3). Next, we have studied the mechanism of miR-155 gene (also known as BIC) upregulation in CLL. Wehave newly identified a regulatory CpG island (BIC-CpG) upstream of miR-155 BIC gene that contains DNA binding motifs for E-box transcription factors and is not mutated in CLL patients. Two E-box-binding proteins, MYB and MYBL2, are significantly upregulated in CLL patient PBMCs as well as in a subset of sorted B-cells in all CLL subgroups. Furthermore in primary CLL cells, MYB protein presence is significantly enriched at BIC-CpG alongside a marked enrichment with transcriptionally active chromatin mark histone H3K9Acetyl. To further study the role of MYB in transactivation of the BIC-CpG we have prepared reporter constructs and found that MYB indeed activates BIC-CpG and downstream transcription. Apart from miR-155/BIC, expression profiling analysis identified additional \u223c50 upregulated MYB targets, among them cancer-related genes such as CA1, MCM4, BCL2, PDCD4, and CXCR4. Functional assays using siRNA inhibition of PU.1 in normal PBMCs result in upregulation of miR-155 and MYB, indicating that silencing of PU.1 and upregulation of MYB and its target miR-155 may represent an important mechanism of CLL pathogenesis. Conclusion : Our data propose a mechanistic relationship between PU.1 and its negative regulator miR-155 in CLL. Our data also demonstrate that miR-155 is transcriptionally activated by MYB family of E-box binding proteins. Manipulation of these mechanistic relationships may harbor a potential for molecular therapies against CLL.
