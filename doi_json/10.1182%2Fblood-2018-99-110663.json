    "abstract_text": "Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital erythroblastopenia associated with haploinsufficiency of more than 15 ribosomal protein genes. We identified in the French registry a DBA patient exhibiting a large heterozygous deletion in ribosomal protein gene RPSA , making it a new candidate as a DBA-associated gene. The deletion was confirmed by qPCR using specific intron/exon primers that could discriminate the RPSA gene from pseudo-genes. Consistent loss of function of this allele, RPSA mRNAs were underrepresented in erythroid cultures and in lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) derived from the patient. Additionally, an important decrease in erythroid proliferation was observed in erythroid progenitor and precursor cells derived from the patient's bone marrow CD34 + cells, together with a delay in erythroid differentiation, the activation of the p53 pathway, and a G 0 /G1 cell cycle arrest, which are regular features of DBA patient cells. Similar to other RP genes linked to DBA, interruption of RPSA expression in zebrafish embryos strongly affected development of the head and erythroid cell differentiation, supporting its relevance as a candidate DBA gene. Northern blot analysis also revealed impaired pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) processing in patient LCLs compared to controls. But unexpectedly, the observed pre-rRNA profile was clearly different from that observed in HeLa cells upon RPSA knockdown and suggested a dysfunction of pre-rRNA processing upstream of that produced by a shortage of RPSA. We noticed that the RPSA gene hosts the intron-encoded H/ACA snoRNAs snoRA6 and snoRA62, the latter being included in the deletion. Q-RT-PCR analysis of patient cells showed decreased levels of snoRA62 when compared to controls and to other RP-mutated DBA patients. Strikingly, knocking out the snoRNA62 coding sequence in human haploid HAP1 cells with Crispr/Cas9 resulted in a pre-rRNA maturation defect similar to that observed in the RPSA +/mut DBA patient, thereby revealing a role for snoRA62 in human pre-rRNA processing. These data strongly suggest that, in addition to RPSA haploinsufficiency, the primum movens of DBA in this particular patient includes the deletion of the intronic snoRA62 hosted in the RPSA gene. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a snoRNA is linked to DBA. We will discuss this ongoing work in light of our most recent results in cells and zebrafish models.
