    "abstract_text": "Non-germinal centre small B-cell lymphomas represent a heterogeneous group of non-hodgkin lymphomas which most frequent histologic subtypes are small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). These three lymphoma entities have very different clinical outcomes but may be difficult to distinguish either histologically or clinically. We previously identified transcriptomic signatures specific of these 3 lymphoma subtypes. We further analyzed these lymphomas using Surface-Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time of Flight (SELDI-TOF). A total of 58 tumors, including 20 SLL (all lymph nodes), 20 MZL (1 lymph node and 19 spleens) and 18 MCL (19 lymph nodes and 1 spleen) were analyzed. In addition, we included 7 controls obtained from traumatic normal spleens. The spectra were generated on weak cation exchange (CM10), strong anion exchange (Q10) and reversed-phase (H50) ProteinChip arrays. Protein patterns of all samples were comparatively analysed using two distinct strategies. We first used a binary recursive partitioning method with the Biomarker Pattern software (Ciphergen\u00ae), and second a hierarchical clustering method to visualized patterns of protein peaks completed with a supervised method (discriminating score) to point out individual peaks distinguishing the three histological subtypes (SLL, MZL and MCL). Spectra analyses revealed a very homogeneous protein patterns among all lymphoma samples. However specific SLL, MZL and MCL signatures based on 34 protein peaks with differential expression could be identified and allowed to classify 95% of the samples in their respective entity. SLL signature included 9 peaks, MZL signature 16 peaks and MCL signature 9 peaks. The binary recursive partitioning analysis was concordant but identified only the five most discriminant peaks. Further identification of the discriminating peaks is currently realized using SELDI-assisted purification. We are focusing on peaks at 9942 Da for SLL and at 11324 Da for MCL. Functional genomic studies can distinguish non-germinal small B-cell lymphomas at the transcriptomic level (our previous study) and at the proteomic level. This will provide new markers for diagnosis and potentially new therapeutic targets."
