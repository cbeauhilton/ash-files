    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients\u2019, parents\u2019 and providers\u2019 preferences with regard to medical interventions may have a major impact on the implementation of innovations, often delaying initiation significantly. Illustratively, as early as 1997, Carlsson et al. suggested that a 30% reduction of consumption of clotting factor concentrate in prophylactic treatment could be attained by dosing based on an individual pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, with a concomitant cost reduction. Therefore, we aim to evaluate do\u2019s and don\u2019ts in hemophilia patients, parents and professionals with regard to individualized dosing according to PK-profile of prophylaxis with clotting factor concentrate. This in order to successfully implement this intervention when imperative. Methods: In this study we included patientswith hemophilia currently or previously on prophylactic treatment with clotting factor concentrate (n=114) and parents of patients aged 12-18 years (n=19) from five Dutch Academic Hemophilia Treatment Centers, and hemophilia professionals attending the World Federation of Haemophia congress 2012 from throughout the world (n=91). Data were analysed using a Discrete Choice Experiment. Patients\u2019, parents\u2019 and professionals\u2019 preferences with regard to the intervention, are measured by specific attributes with varying levels: \u2018number of blood samples necessary to construct individual PK-profile\u2019, \u2018advised frequency of prophylactic infusions\u2019, \u2018frequency of repetitive PK-profiling\u2019, \u2018risk of bleeding\u2019, \u2018estimated cost reduction of treatment with benefit for society\u2019. Results: For patients and parents (response rate 64%), a higher dosing frequency e.g. daily dosing was an important barrier. They were however willing to infuse more frequently, if bleeding was consequently reduced. \u2018Reduction of costs for society\u2019 by implementation of individualized dosing according to PK profile was found relevant and motivating to implement PK-guided dosing. For professionals the most important attributes driving implementation were an acceptable \u2018advised frequency of prophylactic infusions\u2019 and reduction of \u2018risk of bleeding\u2019. Conclusions: When anticipating implementation of a medical intervention, defining of preferences of those involved is of importance. In case of PK-guided prophylactic dosing in hemophilia conclusions are: realise the impact of daily dosing of clotting factor concentrate, use frequent bleeding as a motivator to initiate PK-guided dosing and actively discuss costs of treatment with those undergoing treatment and the cost reduction that may result from PK-guided dosing. Identification of these preferences will secure successful implementation in the near future. Disclosures Lock: ZonMW: Research Funding; Baxter: Research Funding.
