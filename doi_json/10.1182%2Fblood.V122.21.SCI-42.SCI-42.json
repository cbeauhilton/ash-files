    "abstract_text": "Many, perhaps most, cancer chemotherapy agents kill cancer cells via the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis that is controlled by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Bcl-2 family proteins regulate commitment to cell death by controlling mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). To better understand how cancer cells commit to apoptosis, and what drugs might make them commit to apoptosis, we have studied perturbing mitochondria with BH3 peptides that are derived from pro-death Bcl-2 family proteins. Using this provocative test, which we call BH3 profiling, we are able to measure how close a cell is to the threshold of apoptosis, a property we call \u201cpriming\u201d. Priming corresponds to sensitivity to chemotherapy. Moreover, BH3 profiling can be used to detect dependence on Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL for survival, which predicts cytotoxic response to small molecule antagonists such as ABT-199 and ABT-263. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we find that dependence on either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL varies from case to case, with very important consequences for sensitivity to ABT-199 and ABT-263. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ABT-199 has already demonstrated significant clinical activity that corresponds to its on-target activity in mitochondria in vitro . We have been testing how this in vitro mitochondrial activity in BH3 profiling assays might be translated into a useful clinical predictive biomarker. Finally, we can measure how short term incubation with many kinds of drugs, including targeted pathway inhibitors, can increase cancer cell priming, including for primary lymphoid malignancy cells. This short term increase in priming predicts subsequent cancer cell death, including in clinical treatment. We call this method \u201cDynamic BH3 Profiling\u201d and are exploring how it might best be utilized in the clinic.
