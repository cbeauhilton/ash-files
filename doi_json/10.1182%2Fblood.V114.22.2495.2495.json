The toxicity of HDCT, however, might manifest itself in the respective patients' reduced quality of life (QoL). In this study we investigated the QoL of long term survivors after HDCT in comparison with patients after conventional chemotherapy and the healthy German population. Patients and Methods: QoL was evaluated with two standardized questionnaires: EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D. The cancer-specific EORTC-QLQ-C30 consists of thirty questions concerning three main categories: global health state, functional and symptomatic state. The single questions belonging to functional and symptomatic state can furthermore be grouped into different subcategories. The EQ-5D visualizes five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain, and anxiety. In addition to that, the visual analogue scale (VAS) is included to outline the patients' overall health state. A total of 98 patients were included in the study. 37 patients (13 female, 24 male) with a median age of 46 (range 23-72) received HDCT with PBSCT between 1986 and 2007. This group was compared with 61 patients (36 female, 25 male; median age 41, range 21-72) treated with conventional chemotherapy and supplementary radiation in our institution. In the conventional chemotherapy group BEACOPP was used in most cases (n=31), followed by ABVD (n=20), a combination of both (n=8) and ABV (n=2). All patients were in continuous clinical remission. Median follow-up for the HDCT group is 11 and for the conventional chemotherapy group 3.5 years. In addition, Qol of the patients was compared to QoL of healthy people on the basis of two studies about the general health status of the German population (R. Schwarz and A. Hinz: \u201cReference data for the quality of life questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30 in the general German population,\u201d European Journal of Cancer 37 [2001]: 1345-1351; H. H. Ko\u0308nig et al.: \u201cHealth Status of the German Population: Results of a Representative Survey Using the EuroQoL Questionnaire,\u201d Gesundheitswesen 67 [2005]: 173-182). Results: In the HDCT group, the results of the questionnaires show a reduced QoL compared to the healthy population. Regarding the three main categories of the EORTC QLQ-C30, the mean sum score for global health state (ghs) is 68.69, for functional state (fs) 72.49 and for symptomatic state (ss) 21.55 (the ideal score being 100.00 for the first two items and 0.00 for the latter). The mean value for EQ-5D is 0.880 (ideal value: 1.000) and that for VAS is 71.60 (ideal value: 100.00). The one sample t-test evaluation shows that the decrease in QoL is significant with p<0.05 in all of the subcategories of the functional state; four of the nine subcategories of the symptomatic state, namely fatigue, dyspnoea, diarrhoea and financial difficulties. Compared to the group of patients who received conventional chemotherapy (ghs: 73.92; fs: 77.36; ss: 16.27), there is a tendency towards reduced QoL in patients with HDCT in all of the three main categories of the EORTC-QLQ-C30, in particular in the category of symptomatic state. However, these differences were not statistically significant, with the exception of the subcategory of dyspnoea (p<0.001). In the EQ-5D questionnaire, there was a trend for reduced QoL of patients after HDCT compared to conventional chemotherapy patients and healthy people, however these effects were not significant (p = 0.06 and p = 0.089). Conclusions: In this long term follow up study, QoL is reduced in patients after HDCT as well as in patients after conventional treatment compared to the healthy population. There was a trend that QoL might be worse in the HDCT group compared to the conventional therapy group; however this effect was not statistically significant. We conclude that the negative impact of both HDCT and conventional therapy on the QoL of long term survivors with Hodgkin's lymphoma should not be underestimated and should lead to the development of less toxic therapy strategies.
