    "abstract_text": "Confinement to a nursing home ( NH ) is an independent risk factor for VTE and accounts for 13% of all VTE occurring in the community, but the question of which NH residents are at risk is largely unanswered. Objective: To determine VTE risk factors among NH residents. Methods: Using the Minnesota State Case Mix Review Program Public Research Files, we performed a case-control study of all Olmsted County, MN NH patients with an ICD-9 code-identified diagnosis of VTE from 1988\u20131994. From the same source, we identified one age-, sex-matched control and used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios for an association of VTE with 46 characteristics assessed in the Minnesota Case Mix data. Results: Univariate associations between characteristics and odds of VTE are described below. Significantly increased odds were observed for residents assessed following hospitalization (a nearly 4-fold increase, p=0.002, Table ) and residents considered incapable of self-preservation (i.e., unable to cope with potentially harmful situations) (> 2.0 fold increase, p=0.03). Non-significant 2\u20133 fold increased odds were observed for limitations in certain specific Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (including walking and dressing) and for limitations in more than 3 ADLs. Similar increased odds were observed for residents using a wheelchair, taking more than 3 oral medications, enrolled in professional activity programs, and needing behavior management. Conclusions: Need for assistance (especially problems with immobility), lack of self preservation, and recent hospitalization may identify a subset of NH residents that are at especially high VTE risk and who may warrant consideration of prophylaxis.
