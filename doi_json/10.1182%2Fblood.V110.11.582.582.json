    "abstract_text": "In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), haplo-identical stem cell transplantation (SCT) can lead to expansion and activation of Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIR)-HLA class I mismatched NK cells, resulting in reduced rates of leukemia relapse and no graft-versus-host disease (Ruggeri et al. Science 2002). However, this SCT is not available to the majority of AML patients who are elderly. To explore the feasibility of achieving similar NK-mediated anti-leukemia activity by a pharmacological approach, we generated fully human anti-KIR mAbs that block the interactions of inhibitory KIR2DL receptors with their HLA-C ligands, thereby enhancing NK activity. Here we describe one such therapeutic candidate anti-KIR mAb, designated 1-7F9. As distinct HLA-C allotypes are recognized by KIR2DL1 or \u22122/3, only mAbs that cross-react with these KIRs would be expected to work in the entire population. Hence, 1-7F9 was initially selected based on its ability to bind soluble, recombinant KIR2L1, \u22122 and \u22123. By Biacore analysis, the bivalent affinities for KIR2DL1 and \u22123 were 0.43 \u00d7 10 \u22129 M and 0.025 \u00d7 10 \u22129 M, respectively. In experimental systems and in normal human blood, 1-7F9 bound KIR2DL1, \u22122 and \u22123, and \u22122DS1 and \u22122, but not to KIR2DS3 or \u22124. 1-7F9 dose-dependently inhibited the binding of soluble KIR2DL1-Fc to cell surface HLA-Cw4. 1-7F9 augmented the lysis of 721.221-Cw4 B-EBV cells by an NK cell line transfected with KIR2DL1 (YTS-2DL1) from 5% lysis in absence of mAb to a maximal 55% lysis at 5 ug/ml of mAb, but did not affect lysis by KIR-negative NK cells. Lysis of PHA-stimulated blasts and primary AML blasts by autologous IL-2 activated NK cells (E:T=6:1) was 10 and 15%, respectively, in absence of mAb vs 80% and 55% in presence of 1-7F9. Incubation of IL-2 activated blood mononuclear cells with 1-7F9 resulted in expression of the activation marker CD107 on about 10% of KIR2D-positive NK cells, which increased to 20% upon addition of HLA-C-positive B-EBV targets, suggesting that 1-7F9 preferentially induces activation of NK cells in presence of transformed cells. The isotype of 1-7F9 is IgG4; accordingly, it did not cause depletion of KIR positive cells in vitro or in vivo in KIR-transgenic mice despite long-lived KIR-occupancy. As KIR are not found in mice, in vivo activity was tested in a NOD-SCID mouse model where inoculation of in vitro-expanded NK cells (80% of NK cells KIR2D-positive) and autologous human B-EBV cells (E:T=1:3) resulted in death of all mice by day 26. A single injection of 1-7F9 (125 ug/mouse) resulted in long-term survival, with 100% of treated mice alive beyond day 60; in contrast, 60 ug/mouse of the mAb was ineffective. Similarly, ex vivo pre-incubation of NK cells with 1-7F9 (37,3 ug/10 6 NK cells) prior to inoculation in mice resulted in elimination of the autologous transformed B cells in vivo and survival of 100% of the treated animals. These data show that 1-7F9 augments NK-mediated tumor killing in vitro and in vivo, and that it exhibits long-lived KIR binding in vivo, providing a preclinical basis for initiating phase 1 clinical trials with the mAb."
