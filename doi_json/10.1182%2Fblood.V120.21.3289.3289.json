    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3289 Functional T cell immunity depends on the diversity of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Numerous cytolytic assaults can perturb effector cell fitness by inhibiting thymic de novo T cell production or predisposing peripheral CD8 + T cells to exhaustion. In fact, age-associated thymic atrophy and PD-1 upregulation remain the critical components of immune dysfunction. Normal thymopoiesis arises from marrow-derived CD3 \u2212 CD4 \u2212 CD8 \u2212 triple-negative T cell progenitors (TN) which seed the thymic cortex. Thereafter, TN develop into mature single-positive (SP) CD4 or CD8 T cells after expressing both CD4 and CD8 (double-positive-DP) transiently, leading to de novo T cell production. Interleukin-7 (IL7) is a singularly important common \u03b3-chain interleukin involved in this process. In order to pharmacologically enhance thymopoiesis, we report the development of a novel biopharmaceutical based on the fusion of GMCSF and IL7, hereafter GIFT7. Systemic administration of GIFT7 compared to IL7 in young immune competent mice leads to a transient increase in the number of DN1 (5.48\u00b11.01 v.s. 2.74\u00b11.07 \u00d7 10 6 , p=0.046) by day 7. Total thymic cellularity significantly increases in GIFT7-treated group by day 14 (237\u00b151.3 v.s. 123\u00b125.6 \u00d7 10 6 , p=0.026). GIFT7-mediated hypertrophic effect is significantly more pronounced in aged thymi: 111\u00b121.8, 67.8\u00b113.9, 60.3\u00b14.6 \u00d7 10 6 for 7-dose of (5ug kg \u22121 ) GIFT7, IL7, or PBS treatment respectively. We observed a significant increase in DN1 and DN4 subsets with the greatest fold difference in the CD44 int DN1 subset. Histologically, GIFT7 administration leads to significant cortical thymic hyperplasia (cortex: medulla ratio 2.67:1). Functionally, GIFT7 enhances viral-specific CTL responsiveness as modeled by murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) peptide MHC + tetramer enumeration (10.4\u00b13.8 v.s. 2.9\u00b11.4 \u00d7 10 6 for GIFT7 and untreated respectively, p<0.05). In the periphery, GIFT7 selectively expand a CD8 + subset with a Central Memory (CM) phenotype defined as CD8 + CD44 + CD62L + CCR7 + KLRG \u2212 CD27 + PD1 \u2212 . This unique expansive effect of GIFT7 is also demonstrated on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from non-human primates (NHP), in that GIFT7 stimulation of pre-activated NHP-PBMC leads to a two-fold increase in total cell number after 3 days and >80% of Ki67 + expression in both CD4 + and CD8 + compartments. Interestingly, GIFT7-mediated proliferation in CD8 + T cells is accompanied by a 40% decrease in the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of PD1 expression. Our work identifies a CD44 int CD25 \u2212 subset of DN thymocytes most responsive to IL7R-mediated STAT5 hypersignalling and their function as T cell progenitors in GIFT7-driven thymic reconstitution. This points to the translational potential of GIFT7 or GIFT7-primed T lineage cells as treatment of immune malfunction. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
