    "abstract_text": "To determine the difference in proportion of patients who achieved a rise in platelet count and to determine the risk difference of adverse events in patients with acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura treated with corticosteroids or gamma globulin (IVIG). Medline, EMBASE, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Pediatrics and Journal of Pediatrics (all up to 2005) and personal collections of the authors. Systematic search of articles utilizing a search strategy was performed to identify relevant articles according to prior inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fixed effects and random effects models were used to determine summary effect estimates. Difference in proportion of patients who achieved the desired platelet count and risk difference of adverse events between treatment groups. Analysis of 9 randomized controlled trials showed that IVIG produced an additional 12\u201314% increase in proportion of patients with platelet count >20 x 109/L and 15% increase in proportion of patients with platelet count >50 x 109/L on days 2 to 4. No significant differences were seen between the treatment groups on days 14 and 28 except for platelet count >50 x 109/L. More patients in oral steroid treated group had adverse events compared to IVIG treated group but no differences were noted in the parenteral treated group. IVIG is more effective compared to corticosteroids in raising the platelet count during the early part of treatment. IVIG and parenteral steroids shows less adverse events as compared to oral steroid.",
