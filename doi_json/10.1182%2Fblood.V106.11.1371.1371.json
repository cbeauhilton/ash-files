    "abstract_text": "SALL4, a gene homologous to the Drosophila homeotic spalt, is a zinc finger transcriptional factor essential for human development. In Drosophila, spalt is regulated by the Wnt signaling pathway, a pathway critical for hematopoietic self-renewal of stem cells. We cloned SALL4 and its isoforms (SALL4A and SALL4B). We used immunohistochemistry, to demonstrate that SALL4 was constitutively expressed in primary acute myeloid leukemia cells (French American British, FAB: M1 to M5, N=81). The SALL4 in RNA was quantitative in bone marrow cells derived from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and compared to non-neoplastic hematopietic cells from a purified CD34 progenitor pool, normal bone marrow and peripheral blood by RT-PCR. SALL4 expression was present in the purified normal CD34 + cells, AML blasts, but absent in mature myeloid cells. We tested the leukemogenic potential of constitutive overexpression of SALL4 in a murine hematopoietic model. All transgenic mice overexpressing SALL4B using the CMV promoter developed hematopoietic disorders, including myelodysplastic (MDS)-like symptoms and an AML transformation that disseminated to peripheral tissues including the spleen, liver, kidney and lymph nodes. The myelodysplastic features in these transgenic mice were pathologically similar to human MDSs and manifested as ineffective myelopoiesis. Dysplatic features such as Pseudo-Pelger-Huet like atypical white cells, and increased immature cells were detectable in the transgenic mouse peripheral blood. A high level of apoptosis and increased immature cells were also evident in transgenic mouse marrows and day-7 colony-forming unit assays in vitro . Both SALL4A and SALL4B were able to bind to \u03b2-catenin in vitro and synergistically enhanced the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in a reporter gene assay. Our data suggests that the constitutive expression of SALL4 is causal to the leukemic phenotype. Our model should provide a useful platform to analyze the interaction of SALL4 with Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway in leukemia stem cells.",
