    "abstract_text": "Tissue-resident memory T cells (T RM ) are a newly described subset of transcriptionally-distinct memory CD4 and CD8 cells that persist in barrier and non-barrier tissues. They are non-circulating, able to facilitate the recruitment of circulating effector cells and elicit rapid recall responses. The majority of T RM cells can be identified by the expression of CD69 and \u03b1E integrin, CD103. However, CD69 + CD103 - T RM cells have also been described. In graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), alloreactive effector T cells enter GVHD target tissues and mediate tissue damage through direct and indirect mechanisms.The recruitment of effector T cells into tissues is in general not dependent on the tissue expressing the target antigen; and even if a target antigen is available in a tissue, there could be niches free of presented alloantigen. We therefore hypothesized that even in GVHD where alloantigen is ubiquitous, T RM may develop. We first explored T RM formation in a CD4 T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic (Tg) GVHD system wherein donor BALB/c RAG2 -/- TS1 TCR Tg T cells target the S1 peptide derived from HA, which is expressed ubiquitously in BALB/c RAG2 -/- HA104 mice. In this model, GVHD is induced by <1000 TS1 cells and is manifest by weight loss, death, and TS1-infiltrative pathology of the skin, liver, small bowel and colon. We harvested tissues from GVHD mice at days 21 and 28 post-transplant and quantitated TS1 cells with a T RM phenotype. At day 21, a fraction of TS1 cells expressed CD69 + CD103 + (as % of total TS1 cells) in the epidermis (2.8% \u00b1 1.2), dermis (11.3% \u00b17.9), colon (11.5% \u00b14.5) and small intestine (SI) intraepithelial (IEL) (33.4% \u00b15.8) and lamina propria (LP) (6.8% \u00b10.8). At day 28, CD69 + CD103 + TS1 cells (% of total TS1) were present in the epidermis (13.6% \u00b1 1.9), dermis (15.9% \u00b1 7.7), colon (30.8% \u00b1 6.7) and the SI IEL (69.1% \u00b1 9.2) and SI LP (18.7 \u00b13.2). While there were no CD69 + CD103 + TS1 in the spleen, bone marrow (BM) or liver (days 21 and 28), a small number (1.5% \u00b10.7, day 21; 1.7% \u00b1 0.3, day 28) were found in the mesenteric lymph node (mLN). CD103 - T RM have been described in the liver and secondary lymphoid organs. Consistent with this, CD69 + CD103 - TS1 cells (% of total TS1) were found in the liver (24.6% \u00b16.3, day21; 31.5% \u00b13.1, day 28), BM (23.1% \u00b13.1, day 21; 35.4% \u00b13.2, day 28), spleen (1.8% \u00b10.6, day 21; 9.1% \u00b10.7, day 28) and mLN (9.9% \u00b14.5, day 21; 23.5% \u00b1 3.7, day 28). We are currently confirming the T RM identity of TS1 cells based on their transcriptional and migratory profiles and these data will be presented. Alloreactive T RM were also identified in the B6 (H-2 b ) into 129 (H-2 b ) MHC-matched, multiple minor histocompatibility antigen (miHA)-mismatched model in which GVHD is induced by a mix of CD4 and CD8 cells. A fraction of CD8 cells target the K b -restricted miHA LTFNYRNL derived from H60, which can be tracked with tetramers (Tet H60 ). At day 22 post-transplant, CD69 + CD103 + CD4 cells (% of total CD4 T cells) were found in the epidermis (22.9% \u00b11.2), dermis (19.7% \u00b12.8), colon (9.4% \u00b13.1), SI IEL (26.5% \u00b12.6), SI LP (16.1% \u00b1 3.7) and mLN (6.9% \u00b13.0). CD8 + Tet H60+ T cells (% of total CD8T cells) were detected in the epidermis (7.5% \u00b1 3.5), dermis (10.6% \u00b1 6.7), colon (6.9% \u00b1 2.7), SI IEL (8.9% \u00b16.2), SI LP (10.2% \u00b13.8), mLN (3.0 \u00b1 0.7) and spleen (9.0% \u00b12.9). A fraction of CD8 + Tet H60+ cells in the dermis (7.3% \u00b11.9), colon (18.1% \u00b112.2), SI IEL (50.1% \u00b14.3), SI LP (52.6% \u00b113.6), and mLN (6.3% \u00b1 0.8) were CD69 + CD103 + , suggesting that alloreactive H60-directed CD8 T cells acquired a T RM phenotype. Using two different murine models, we found GVHD-inducing T cells with T RM phenotypes. Future experiments will confirm the T RM identity of these cells and will determine their importance in the maintenance of GVHD, perhaps by serving as a reservoir of cells that maintain GVHD locally.
