    "abstract_text": "In sickle cell disease (SCD), painful vaso-occlusive crises and end-organ damage are caused by occlusion of the vessels due largely to sickle red blood cell (RBC) adhesion to both the endothelium and adherent leukocytes. RBC oxidative damage caused by continuous endogenous and exogenous oxidative stress may participate in the occurrence of vaso-occlusive crises. We have evaluated the effects of scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in sickle RBCs on cell adhesion and vaso-occlusion in a humanized mouse model of vaso-occlusion in vivo analyzed by intravital microscopy. To scavenge RBC ROS, we used our manganese porphyrin-based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimics MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5 + (MnBuOE) and MnTE-2-PyP 5+ (MnE), powerful catalysts of superoxide dismutation, and reductants of peroxynitrite, peroxide and hypochlorite. Intravital microscopy observations of enflamed vessels visible through dorsal skin-fold window chamber implants was performed after the inflammatory trigger of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) to induce vaso-occlusion in transgenic sickle mice followed by subcutaneous injection of MnBuOE at 0.1, 0.2 or 2 mg/kg, or MnE at 0.5 or 2 mg/kg. Treatment of sickle mice with only one dose of 0.1, 0.2 and 2 mg/kg MnBuOE decreased dose-dependently adhesion of both sickle cells and leukocytes in enflamed vessels by 68\u00b14% ( p <0.01), 85\u00b12.3% ( p <0.01) and 89\u00b14.3% ( p <0.01), respectively, compared with vehicle-treated sickle mice. MnBuOE at 0.1, 0.2 and 2 mg/kg also caused significant and dose-dependent reduction in leukocyte rolling flux ( p <0.05). Similar inhibitory benefits were obtained when MnE was administered to TNFa-treated sickle mice. MnE at 0.5 and 2 mg/kg significantly decreased the number of adherent sickle cells and leukocytes by 76\u00b18.6% ( p <0.01) and 92\u00b12.5% ( p <0.01), respectively, and leukocyte rolling flux ( p <0.01) compared to vehicle-treated animals. The effect of these two SOD mimics on sickle RBCs and leukocyte adhesion, and leukocyte rolling flux was rapid, because a decline in cell adhesion and leukocyte rolling flux were already detectable within the first 15 minutes after injection of the compounds. In contrast, cell adhesion and leukocyte rolling flux were already pronounced 15 minutes following vehicle injection. Reduced cell adhesion to the endothelium by the SOD mimics resulted in improved microcirculatory blood flow in sickle mice. These favorable effects on cell adhesion and vaso-occlusion following SOD mimic treatment were indeed due at least to the significant decrease in sickle RBC ROS levels compared to vehicle-treated mice ( p <0.001). The long-term anti-adhesive and anti-inflammatory effects of MnBuOE and MnE in sickle mice were next examined. Subcutaneous administration for 28 days of MnBuOE at 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg inhibited significantly adhesion of RBCs and leukocytes in enflamed venules by 34\u00b113% ( p <0.05) and 69\u00b13.5% ( p <0.001), respectively, and leukocyte rolling flux ( p <0.001) compared to vehicle-treated sickle mice. Subcutaneous injection of MnE at 0.5 and 1 mg/kg for 28 days also had significant effect on sickle cell and leukocyte adhesion ( p <0.01), and leukocyte rolling flux ( p <0.01). In addition, venous blood gases were significantly improved by the SOD mimics. The levels of partial pressure of Carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ), partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2 ), base excess of the extracellular fluid (BEecf), bicarbonate (HCO 3 - ) concentration, total CO 2 (TCO 2 ) concentration, and the indicators of hypoxia, hemoglobin saturation of oxygen (sO 2 ) and lactate, became close to or within the normal ranges ( p <0.05) in sickle mice treated with 1 mg/kg MnE. MnBuOE at 0.1 mg/kg showed only a trend toward an increase in venous blood gases, with a significant decrease in lactate ( p <0.05). Leukocytosis in sickle mice treated with the SOD mimics was also alleviated. A significant drop in leukocyte ( p <0.05), neutrophil ( p <0.01), lymphocyte ( p <0.05) and monocyte ( p <0.05) counts was detected in sickle mice treated with either 0.1 mg/kg MnBuOE or 1 mg/kg MnE. These beneficial therapeutic outcomes induced by the SOD mimics were due at least in part to a decline in RBC ROS levels ( p <0.001) and RBC phosphatidylserine surface exposure ( p <0.05), an eryptosis marker. These results suggest that our SOD mimics may represent a valuable novel therapeutic intervention for not only vaso-occlusive crises, but inflammation as well, that should be further evaluated in patients with SCD.
