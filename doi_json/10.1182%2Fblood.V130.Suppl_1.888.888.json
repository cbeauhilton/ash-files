    "abstract_text": "Background : Approximately 45% of new ALL cases occur in adults \u2265 20 years of age (Howlader et al. SEER Cancer Statistics. 2015), and approximately 50% of adult patients relapse with poor subsequent outcomes (Oriol et al. Haematologica. 2010; Basson et al. JCO. 2011). Promising early efficacy and manageable safety were previously reported with anti-CD19 CAR T cells (KTE-C19) in adult patients with R/R ALL (Shah et al. ASCO 2017. #3024). Here we report updated results of the ZUMA-3 trial. Methods : Adult patients (\u2265 18 years of age) with R/R ALL (Philadelphia+ eligible), > 5% bone marrow (BM) lymphoblasts; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG) 0-1; and adequate renal, hepatic, and cardiac function were eligible. Patients with active graft-versus-host disease or clinically significant infection were not eligible. Patients received a target dose of 1 \u00d7 10 6 CAR T cells/kg or 2 \u00d7 10 6 CAR T cells/kg after lymphodepletion with 25 mg/m 2 /day fludarabine for 3 days and 900 mg/m 2 /day cyclophosphamide given on the last day. The primary endpoint of phase 1 was incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Key secondary endpoints included incidence of adverse events (AEs), incidence of minimal residual disease-negative (MRD - ) responses, duration of remission (DOR), relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). Exploratory endpoints included levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood and levels of cytokines in serum. Results : As of the data cut-off date (DCO; April 26, 2017), 22 patients have been enrolled, and 16 patients received KTE-C19 on study. Four patients had not received treatment by the DCO, 1 patient did not receive KTE-C19 due to an AE after conditioning, and 1 patient received KTE-C19 under compassionate use. All 16 patients who received KTE-C19 prior to the DCO were included in the safety analysis, and all patients who had the opportunity to be followed for 8 weeks prior to the DCO were included in the efficacy analysis (n = 11). Of the 16 patients dosed with KTE-C19, 63% were male, 56% had ECOG 1, and 50% had received \u2265 2 previous lines of treatment, including 3 patients with prior blinatumomab. Nineteen percent of patients had undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplant, 31% had R/R to \u2265 second-line therapy, 31% had primary refractory disease, and 19% experienced first relapse within 12 months of first remission. Most patients (81%) had baseline BM blasts \u2265 60%. Six patients received the 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/kg dose and 10 received the 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/kg dose. No DLTs were observed. One patient experienced a grade 5 event of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) at the 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/kg dose, and no other KTE-C19-related grade 5 AEs were observed. In the 16 patients who received KTE-C19, all of whom were followed for at least 4 weeks, the most common grade \u2265 3 AEs were hypotension (56%), anemia (50%), pyrexia (50%), and decreased platelet counts (44%). Grade \u2265 3 CRS and neurologic events (NE) were reported in 25% and 63% of patients, respectively. Tocilizumab (toci) or steroids were given for AE management in 94% and 75% of patients, respectively. In the 11 patients eligible for the efficacy analysis, objective response rate was 82%, including 8 (73%) patients with a complete remission (CR or CR with partial hematopoietic recovery), and 1 (9%) with blast-free BM. All remissions were MRD - as determined by flow cytometry. All 5 (100%) of the other patients who were too early for inclusion in the efficacy analysis had MRD- bone marrow with varying degrees of count recovery at the time of the DCO. Median follow-up was 6.8 months; 4 patients relapsed 63 - 168 days after treatment with KTE-C19. Efficacy was comparable between patients who recieved KTE-C19 doses of 1 \u00d7 10 6 and 2 \u00d7 10 6 CAR T cells/kg. Data from additional patients, including those treated with a lower dose of 0.5 \u00d7 10 6 CAR T cells/kg, as well as updated safety, efficacy, biomarker, and product characteristic analyses across dosing groups will be presented. Conclusions : In this ongoing phase 1 study, KTE-C19 has shown promising efficacy in adult patients with R/R ALL. The safety profile was generally manageable and additional approaches to improve the benefit:risk profile are being explored. ZUMA-3 continues to enroll additional patients at the 0.5 \u00d7 10 6 CAR T cells/kg dose level.
