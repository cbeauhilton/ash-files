    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4856 Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics, prognostic factors and survival outcomes of patients with gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Patients and methods: 162 patients with gastric DLBCL were evaluated retrospectively. Comparisons were made between patients of gastric DLBCL with component of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (DLBCL/MALT) and patients of gastric DLBCL without detectable MALT component (de novo DLBCL). Results: Results according to the distribution of sex, age, stage, performance status, and other clinical characteristics were similar between de novo DLBCL group and DLBCL/MALT group (p>0.05). The ratio of patients with the germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) subtype to non-GCB subtype did not differ significantly between the two groups (1:1.1 versus 1:1.6, p=0.319). However, the proportion of patients with the stage-modified international prognostic index (m-IPI) \u22652 was higher in DLBCL/MALT groups (18%) than taht in de novo DLBCL groups (34%) (p=0.026). In addition, the H. pylori infection rate was 75% in DLBCL/MALT versus 38% in de novo DLBCL (p<0.001). Patients with de novo DLBCL have better 5-year PFS and OS estimates than those DLBCL/MALT patients (p=0.037 and 0.019 for the 5-year PFS and OS estimates, respectively). Surgical treatment did not offer survival benefit when compared with chemotherapy (p=0.405 and 0.065 for the 5-year PFS and OS estimates, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that non-GCB classification and m-IPI\u22652 were independently associated with shorter OS and advanced stage was independently associated with shorter PFS. Conclusion: Gastric DLBCL is a heterogeneous disease that included de novo DLBCL and DLBCL/MALT lymphoma. Compared with the former, the latter has a higher H. pylori infection rate. And what's more, the proportion of patients with m-IPI\u22652 is higher in DLBCL/MALT groups. De novo DLBCL was associated with higher 5-year PFS and OS estimates. Non-surgical treatment should be a primary consideration for gastric DLBCL. Immunophenotype classification and m-IPI were the most reliable factors for OS, and advanced stage was for PFS.
