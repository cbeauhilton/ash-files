    "abstract_text": "Background. The recent advance of antiretroviral therapy decreased the morbidity of opportunistic infections. However, the incidence of HIV-associated lymphoma remains high. Also, the outcome of the HIV-associated lymphoma is unclear in the era of rituximab. In order to address these clinical questions, we performed a nation-wide epidemiological study. Methods. Patients with HIV-associated lymphoma were extracted from the database of Japanese society of hematology blood disease registry from January 2012 to December 2015. We analyzed the patient's age, sex, subtypes of lymphoma, the international prognostic index (IPI) for diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and overall survival. Results. Eighty-one patients were extracted from the database. Eighty patients were available for the survival analysis. Seventy-six (93.8%) patients of them were male. The median age was 52.5(25-88) year-old. However, there were two peaks of age; the first peak was 38-40-year-old and the second was 59-62-year-old. Sub-types of lymphomas were diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)(48.1%), Burkitt lymphoma(19.8%), primary CNS lymphoma(8.6%), plasmablastic lymphoma(7.4%), peripheral T cell lymphoma(3.7%), Hodgkin's lymphoma(3.7%), primary effusion lymphoma(2.5%), MALT lymphoma(1.2%), Follicular lymphoma(1.2%) and Adult T cell lymphoma/leukemia(1.2%). Extra-nodal involvement at the diagnosis was observed in 61.7%. The involved sites were the brain, stomach, small bowel, colon, thyroid and the others. In DLBCL, the patients with IPI high and high-intermediate risk was 51.3%. The median observation period was 26 months. Estimated 3 years overall survival (OS) in all cases was 68.8+/-0.63%. Although there was no statistical significance, however, the 3 years, OS of Burkitt lymphoma tended to be better than that of DLBCL (84.6%+/-10.0 versus 67.7+/-8.8%). Log-rank analysis showed the OS in DLBCL patients with IPI high-intermediate and high risk was significantly worse than the patients with low, and low-intermediate risk (p<0.001). Estimated 3 years OS was 90+/-9.5% vs. 38.0+/-13.0%, respectively. The outcome of patients with primary CNS lymphoma remains poor, estimated 3 years OS was 45.7+/-22.4%. Conclusion. Our study showed diversity in the pathological subtype of HIV lymphoma. In the era of rituximab, the outcome seemed to be improved in patients with DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma. However, the survival remains short in patients with poor prognostic factors and primary CNS lymphoma. Figure. View large Download slide Figure.
