    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1807 We have recently demonstrated that cereblon (CRBN) mediates the direct anti-myeloma activity of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). However, the genes/pathways downstream of CRBN associated with anti-myeloma activity remain unclear. We, and others, identified interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) as one of the downstream targets of CRBN-associated signaling. Both lenalidomide treatment and CRBN knockdown downregulate IRF4. IRF4 levels return to baseline in IMiD resistant cells surviving CRBN silencing. To determine whether IMiD-induced IRF4 downregulation is critical to anti-MM activity, we overexpressed IRF4 in two IMiD-sensitive human MM cell lines (HMCLs), KMS11 and MM1.S, followed by lenalidomide treatment. Lenalidomide-induced cytotoxicity was greatly impaired in both HMCLs overexpressing IRF4 compared with the control virus infected cells. Further analysis indicated that IRF4 over-expression does not completely prevent lenalidomide-induced growth arrest, but reduces cell death by 70% after lenalidomide treatment. Immunoblotting analysis of KMS11 cells indicated that IRF4 over-expression blocks lenalidomide-induced activation of caspase 8, reduces up-regulation of p21 waf and increases CDK6 expression but does not significantly affect lenalidomide-induced MYC down-regulation. Although cereblon and IRF4 are broadly expressed in MM, baseline levels of expression are only weakly correlated (r=0.22) in primary MM patient gene expression analysis. Gene expression studies revealed statistical changes in 1,368 genes when comparing high versus low CRBN expression in primary myeloma samples. Interestingly genes associated with high CRBN expression included cyclin D2, SOCS3 and IL4 while genes associated with low cereblon expression included cyclin D1, FRZB and CD200. In order to understand how CRBN is connected with downstream anti-myeloma signaling, a structure-function study was performed to determine which CRBN domain is required for lenalidomide-induced IRF4 down-regulation and cytotoxicity. Lentiviral constructs expressing wild-type CRBN and a series of mutated CRBN were generated, including mutations at thalidomide binding site (Y384A/W386A), deletion of DDB1 binding region (\u0394Mid) and truncations at N-terminal and C-terminal. Lentiviruses from these constructs were used to infect IMiDs resistant HMCLs, OCI-MY5 and MM1.S res. Both of these cell lines have very low endogenous CRBN expression and they became sensitive to lenalidomide after introduction of wild-type CRBN. Conversely, introduction of CRBN with mutated thalidomide-binding site or with DDB1 binding region depletion failed to mediate lenalidomide toxicity and down-regulation of IRF4. OCI-MY5 cells expressing either N-terminal or C-terminal truncated CRBN showed substantial reduced responses (more than 50%) to lenalidomide compared with wild-type CRBN expressing cells. Deletion of only 20\u201330 amino acids at either ends of CRBN greatly impaired the protein function, suggesting that protein folding might be important for CRBN-mediated IMiD response. Our data indicate that IMiD induced myeloma cytotoxicity is largely mediated by modifying CRBN associated E3 ubiqutin ligase and subsequent IRF4 downregulation, suggesting the CRBN-IRF4 axis is a potential target for development of new anti-myeloma drugs.
