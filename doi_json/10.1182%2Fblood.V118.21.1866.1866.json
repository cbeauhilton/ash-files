    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1866 Background: In multiple myeloma (MM), the association between the response to induction before autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and long-term outcome is less clear but the situation may change with the introduction of novel agents. We therefore assessed the clinical relevance of response of bortezomib induction treatment or post-ASCT response for patients who received bortezomib-combined induction chemotherapy followed by ASCT. Methods: We retrospectively assessed 183 MM patients who received bortezomib-containing induction therapy (BTZ-IT) followed by ASCT in 24 institutions throughout Korea between 2003 and 2010. Records of these patients were reviewed using the Korean Myeloma Registry database ( www.myeloma.or.kr ). Each institution was requested to reconfirm the data using additional case report forms. Patients who had overt MM based on International Myeloma Working Group diagnostic criteria were selected. Results: One-hundred seventy eight patients were eligible. Their median age was 56 years (range, 28\u201369 years) and 96 (53.9%) were male. Forty nine (27.5%) received bortezomib as front-line therapy and 129 (72.5%) as second-line treatment. All patients underwent ASCT and 22 (12.4%) were treated with tandem ASCT. Ninety-seven (54.5%) patients were treated with maintenance therapy after ASCT. After BTZ-IT, the response rates in this selected series of patients were 37.6% CR, 12.4% VGPR, 41.0% PR, 7.3% SD and 1.7% PD ( Figure 1 A, 1 B, 1 C); the corresponding post-ASCT rates were 69.2% CR, 14.0% VGPR, 11.0% PR, 2.9% SD and 2.9% PD. At a median follow-up of 46.6 months, the 3-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were 70.0% and 31.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that factors independently predictive of OS and EFS included achievement of BTZ-IT response \u00b0A\u0303 PR (P=0.025 and P=0.014, respectively) and the treatment with maintenance therapy (P=0.048 and P=0.001, respectively). Post-ASCT CR vs. \u00b0A\u0302 VGPR was also an independent prognostic factor for OS and EFS (P=0.0001 and P=0.002, respectively). Figure 1.

View large Download slide View large Download slide View large Download slide Post-ASCT overall survival according to the response to BTZ induction Conclusion: At least PR to BTZ-IT and CR after ASCT were predictive of survival. These findings suggest that patients who responded to BTZ-IT may benefit from ASCT due to an enhanced quality of response. Maintenance therapy can also affect patient outcomes.
