    "abstract_text": "Adoptive immunotherapy with in-vitro expanded antigen-specific T cells (TC) is often hampered by the extended culture times required to generate sufficient numbers of antigen- specific TC and their limited persistence in-vivo. IL-2 predominantly supports the generation of short-lived effector memory (T EM ) and effector (T E ) CD8 + TC without expanding the CD62L + and CCR7 + central memory T cells (T CM ), which may persist for long periods in vivo. We examined the potential of IL-15 to foster growth of CMVpp65- specific TC as well as expansion of both T EM and T CM CD8 + TC. Accordingly, TC from 3 seropositive donors bearing HLA A0201 were sensitized in-vitro using NIH 3T3 based artificial antigen presenting cells transduced to express B7.1, ICAM-1, LFA-3, \u03b2 2 -M and HLA A0201 heavy chain as well as CMVpp65 (A2-AAPC) in presence of exogenous IL-2, IL-15 or IL-15 plus IL-2. To assess if trans-presentation of IL-15 by the receptor alpha on AAPCs leads to enhancement of IL-15 activity, we sequentially transduced A2-AAPCs with the IL-15 and IL-15 receptor alpha cDNA (A2- AAPC IL-15/IL-15R\u03b1). TC were then cultured using A2-AAPC with either IL-2 (20U/ml) IL-15 (10ng/ml) IL-2 plus IL-15 or with A2-AAPC IL-15/IL-15R\u03b1 or A2-AAPC IL-15R\u03b1 + IL-2 (20U/ml). TC sensitized using either A2-AAPC IL-15/IL-15R\u03b1 or A2-AAPC + IL-15 demonstrated ~ 1500\u20132000 fold expansion of CMVpp65 A2-NLV tetramer (+) CD8 + TC, compared to a 300\u2013600 fold expansion using A2-AAPC + IL-2 after 21\u201328 days in culture. Cultures containing IL-15 generated 25\u201370 \u00d710 6 A2-NLV tetramer (+) CD8 + TC in comparison to 10\u201318 \u00d710 6 in cultures with IL-2. At 7\u201310 days, ~20% of the tetramer (+) TC demonstrated a T CM phenotype (CD62L + and CCR7 + ) in all cultures, with 75% T EM and 5% T E . By 21- 28 days, no T CM were detected among tetramer (+) TC in cultures containing exogenous IL-2, IL-15 or IL-2 plus IL-15. However, TC sensitized with A2-AAPC IL-15/IL-15R\u03b1 still contained 10\u201312% (~7\u00d710 6 ) tetramer (+) CD8 + T CM which further increased through day 35. In functional assays, TC sensitized in the presence of IL-15 or AAPCs expressing IL-15 and IL-15R\u03b1 elicited superior CMV-specific responses with 7\u201320% CD8 + TC demonstrating CMVpp65 epitope specific interferon gamma production compared to 2\u20133% in cultures with IL-2. Cytotoxic activity against CMV pp65 peptide loaded autologous EBV transformed B-cell lines (E:T= 10:1) was higher for TC sensitized with IL-15 (80%) compared to cultures with IL-2 (60%). The cytotoxic activity against HLA mismatched targets or K562 was <5% in all cultures. In conclusion, our data demonstrate higher yields and augmented function in antigen specific T cells cultured with IL-15. TC sensitized with A2-AAPC-CMVpp65 together with IL-15 +/\u2212 IL-2 only supported sustained expansion of T EM and T E . In contrast, TC sensitized with A2-AAPC IL-15/IL-15R\u03b1 also supported sustained expansion of T CM .",
