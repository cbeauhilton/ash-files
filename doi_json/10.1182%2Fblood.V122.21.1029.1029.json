    "abstract_text": "Background The formation of platelet-leukocyte conjugates has been implicated in a variety of pathologies, including thrombosis, atherosclerosis, glomerulonephritis, multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. In prior studies (Simon et al., J. Exp Med, 2000, 193-204), platelet GPIb\u03b1 and leukocyte \u03b1M\u03b22 (CD11b/CD18) had been implicated as receptor:counter-receptor pairing in mediating formation of platelet:leukocyte complexes. A specific segment (\u03b1M201-217) in the I domain of \u03b1M (CD11b) subunit of \u03b1M\u03b22 engaged GPIb\u03b1, and a peptide (M2) corresponding to this segment blocked neutrophil recognition of platelets and anti-M2 blocked conjugate formation (Ehlers et al., J. Exp. Med, 2003, 1077-88). The I-domains of \u03b1M and \u03b1X are highly conserved (74% homology), but \u03b1X has different amino acids at two positions shown to be critical for recognition of GPIb\u03b1 by the \u03b1M I-domain. This study considers the role of a particular receptor:counter-receptor pairing, GPIb on platelets and \u03b1X\u03b22 (CD11c/CD18) on leukocytes, in mediating this heterotypic cell interaction. Methods and Results To directly address whether \u03b1X\u03b22 recognizes GPIb\u03b1, \u03b1X\u03b22 was expressed in HEK cells and its corresponding I-domain was expressed and purified. \u03b1X\u03b22 cells adhered specifically to GPIb\u03b1, and purified \u03b1X I-domain bound to platelets by flow cytometry and to GPIb\u03b1 by surface plasmon resonance. However, this interaction was readily distinguished from that of \u03b1M I-domain binding to GPIb\u03b1. \u03b1X binding to GPIb\u03b1 was not inhibited by: 1) M2 or anti-M2; 2) a peptide from a region of GPIb\u03b1 implicated in vWF interaction and that blocked adhesion of \u03b1M\u03b22 cells to GPIb\u03b1; 3) small molecules that blocked \u03b1M I-domain binding; and 4) mutations in GPIb\u03b1 that blocked \u03b1M I-domain binding. Furthermore, by mutational analyses, a region of \u03b1X I domain was implicated binding GPIb\u03b1 that is structurally distant and unrelated to the \u03b1M I domain binding site. Next, we examined the role of \u03b1X\u03b22 in vivo in a cytokine- and neutrophil-dependent inflammatory response. The local Shwartzman-like reaction (LSR), induced by successive LPS and cytokine injections into the skin, produces a thrombo-hemorrhagic vasculitis, which depends on leukocytes and their interaction with activated platelets and endothelial cells. In prior work, we have shown that the LSR is dependent upon leukocyte \u03b1M and platelet GPIba. Leukocyte-derived microparticles promote the accumulation of fibrin, generation of occlusive thrombi, and eventual hemorrhage from inflamed blood vessels. The LSR produces hemorrhage in the intact skin 24 hours after TNF-a injection. CD11c-/- mice subjected to LSR exhibited a significant reduction in the development of hemorrhagic lesions. In analysis blinded to genotype, CD11c-/- mice had a 76% reduction in lesion severity (lesion hemorrhage score: WT, 3.4 \u00b1 1.0, n=12 vs. CD11c-/-, 0.8 \u00b1 1.0, n=11; P <0.001). Histopathology of vasculitic lesions demonstrated substantial reductions in erythrocyte extravasation, edema, leukocyte accumulation, and occlusive thrombi in CD11c-/- mice. Conclusions Leukocyte \u03b1X\u03b22 (CD11c/CD18) recognizes GPIb\u03b1 on platelets in a way distinct from \u03b1M\u03b22 (CD11bCD18). This interaction appears to be functionally significant in vivo and could be targeted for suppressing adverse inflammatory responses.
