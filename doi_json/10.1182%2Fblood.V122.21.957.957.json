    "abstract_text": "Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1, also known as NRAMP2 and SLC11A2) is a transmembrane protein important for intestinal iron (Fe 2+ ) absorption and erythroid iron utilization. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in DMT1 are associated with moderate to severe hypochromic microcytic anemia in human patients and a mouse model - mk/mk mice. We have previously reported that DMT1 deficiency leads to an impaired erythroid differentiation hallmarked by accumulation of immature forms of erythroblast which also showed increased rate of apoptosis. For human samples we observed suppression of colony-forming capacity of erythroid progenitors that can be corrected by the addition of iron saturated chelate Fe-SIH. Later we proved this result also for mk/mk progenitors and showed reduced number of mk/mk CFU-E (164\u00b125 vs. 283\u00b150) and BFU-E (9\u00b14 vs . 22\u00b15) colonies in comparison to the colonies of wild-type (wt) mice and improvement of the colony growth with Fe-SIH. In our following studies we focused on mature erythrocytes, the last stage of erythroid differentiation that has not been analyzed yet. We first determined the in vivo half-life of red blood cells (RBC). Isolated RBCs from mk/mk mice and wt controls were in vitro labeled with CFSE fluorescent dye and injected into the wt mice. The intensity of RBCs fluorescence was measured on the 1st, 7th, 10th, 14th, 19th, 26th and 30th day following the injection. We observed an accelerated clearance of CFSE-labeled mk/mk RBCs from circulating blood when compared to wt RBCs, which indicates increased destruction of DMT1-mutant erythrocytes in vivo . It is known, that mature RBCs retain the ability to undergo stress-induced death (eryptosis), characterized by their shrinkage, membrane blebbing and phosphatidylserine surface exposure. This process may be triggered by iron deficiency. To determine the involvement of eryptosis in mk/mk RBCs clearance, RBCs were exposed to different stress conditions in vitro . A significantly increased number of Annexin V-positive RBCs was detected for mk/mk RBCs when compared to wt RBCs after 5 and 7 hour exposure to hyperosmotic shock (400mM sucrose) and glucose depletion, respectively. These results indicate shortened life span of DMT1-mutant erythrocytes and their reduced ability to cope with stress. To unravel the possible underlying mechanisms we focus on two processes important for RBC survival; anti-oxidative defense and anaerobic glycolysis. We observed 1.5 to 2-fold higher activity of glutathione peroxidase, catalase and methemoglobin reductase and elevated levels of methemoglobin in mk/mk RBCs in comparison to wt RBCs, indicating increased oxidative stress in mk/mk RBCs. Increased activity of hexokinase (2.5 times) and pyruvatkinase (2.4 times) together with reduced ratio of ATP/ADP in mk/mk mice compared with wt mice (from 2.89\u00b10.56 \u03bcmol/L to 1.71\u00b10.49 \u03bcmol/L) shows enhanced demand for glycolytically derived ATP to maintain the stability of RBC membrane in mk/mk mice. Our analyzes suggest that DMT1 deficiency negatively affects metabolism and life span of mature erythrocytes; two other aspects of defective erythropoiesis contributing to the pathophysiology of the disease.
