    "abstract_text": "Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) recovery post-autologous stem cell transplantation has been documented as an independent predictor for survival in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The effect of ALC recovery on survival during standard CHOP or R-CHOP chemotherapy for newly diagnosed diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is unknown. To participate in the study, patients required to receive their full treatment with complete blood count determinations at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine. Of 1633 DLBCL cases seen at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine between February 1994 through August 2004, 212 consecutive DLBCL patients were eligible for the study. We study ALC recovery as a prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in DLBCL patients treated with at least 3 cycles of CHOP or R-CHOP. 57% were male and the median age was 66 years (range: 20 \u2013 87); 42% had elevated LDH, only 11% had a PS of 2 or higher; 58% were low stage (I or II); 88% of pts achieved a complete response. ALC was evaluated at the beginning of each treatment cycle, focusing on cycles 1\u20133 and the 3 month post treatment sample. ALC for each of the cycles were significantly correlated with PFS and OS, with cycle 1 ALC most significantly correlated when accounting for inherent differences based on treatment (Rx) type (i.e. CHOP vs. R-CHOP) as well as high vs. low IPI (PFS: p = 0.0012; OS: p = 0.005). Also, 74 pts achieved an ALC of at least 1,000 during all three cycles, where there was no significant relationship with this incidence and Rx type; this incidence was significantly associated with higher PFS (p = 0.0007) and OS (p = 0.0006), even when accounting for Rx type and high vs. low IPI. In the 179 pts who had 3-month post-Rx ALC data, this was also significantly associated with PFS (p = 0.002) and OS (p = 0.0009), while still accounting for Rx type and IPI status. Achievement of ALC >= 1,000 post-Rx was also significant for PFS (p = 0.0014) and OS (0.003). Also of note, only cycle 1 ALC was significantly different in high vs. low IPI pts (p = 0.008). In summary, these data support the hypothesis that there is a critical role of lymphocyte (immune) recovery during CHOP/R-CHOP chemotherapy in DLBCL.",
