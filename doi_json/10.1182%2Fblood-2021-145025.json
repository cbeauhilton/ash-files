    "abstract_text": "Background : Follicular lymphoma is an indolent disease with a continuous relapsing pattern and typically requires multiple lines of therapy. Novel therapies such as tisagenlecleucel are being investigated to improve outcomes. Primary analysis of the single-arm, multicenter, Phase II ELARA trial in r/r FL demonstrated that tisagenlecleucel resulted in high overall (ORR) and complete response rates (CRR), and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) at a median follow-up of 11 months (mo). Here, we report updated efficacy results from the overall population at a median follow-up of 17 mo, and a subgroup analysis of pts with high-risk disease from the ELARA trial (NCT03568461). Methods: Eligible adult pts had histologically confirmed r/r FL (grades 1-3A) after \u22652 lines of therapy or had relapsed after autologous stem cell transplant. Bridging therapy was allowed and was followed by disease evaluation before tisagenlecleucel infusion. Pts received tisagenlecleucel (0.6-6\u00d710 8 CAR+ viable T cells) after lymphodepleting chemotherapy (fludarabine [25 mg/m 2 ] + cyclophosphamide [250 mg/m 2 ] QD for 3 d or bendamustine [90 mg/m 2 ] QD for 2 d). Endpoints included ORR, CRR, PFS, and duration of response (DOR). Descriptive efficacy subanalyses were performed for 9 high-risk subgroups, including prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), \u22655 prior lines of therapy, progression of disease within 24 mo from first immunochemotherapy (POD24), double-refractory disease, high Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) at study entry, high lactate dehydrogenase at baseline, high C-reactive protein (CRP) prior to infusion, radiological bulky disease (by GELF criteria), and high total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV; >510 cm 3 ) at baseline (median 155.32 cm 3 ; range 0.1-2470.4 cm 3 ). Descriptive subgroup analysis was supported by multivariate analysis to identify factors predictive of worse outcomes. Results: As of March 29, 2021, 97 pts received tisagenlecleucel and 94 were evaluable for primary efficacy analysis (median follow-up 17 mo). High and durable responses were seen in the overall ELARA population (ORR 86.2%, CRR 69.1%, 9-mo DOR 76.0%, and 12-mo PFS 67.0%). In CR pts at 9 mo, PFS was 85.5% and estimated probability of remaining in response was 86.5%. Safety reflected known tisagenlecleucel profile; 48% of pts had CRS (majority were grade 1/2) and 11.3% had neurological events (3% grade \u22653). In the subgroup analysis, pts were stratified into risk groups. Efficacy (ORR, CRR) and durability of response were well maintained in all high-risk subgroups, except for POD24 (n=35), high TMTV (n=20), and \u22655 prior lines of therapy (n=27). Compared with corresponding low-risk subgroups, there was a numerical reduction in CRR for high-risk subgroups (POD24 59.0% vs 87.9%; high TMTV 40.0% vs 76.4%; \u22655 prior lines of therapy 59.3% vs 73.1%) (Figure). A reduction in 12-mo PFS was also identified for pts in these subgroups: POD24 (60.8% vs 77.9%), high baseline TMTV (54.5% vs 68.5%), and \u22655 prior lines of therapy (59.6% vs 69.7%). Evaluating the disease characteristics of the high TMTV subgroup compared with low TMTV, high TMTV was associated with a higher incidence of bulky disease (58.3% vs 90.0%), high FLIPI (54.2% vs 85.0%), and high CRP (45.8% vs 70.0%). In the multivariate analysis of high-risk factors, only POD24 (hazard ratio [HR] 2.34; 95% CI, 1.02- 5.34) and high TMTV (HR 2.53; 95% CI, 1.14-5.65) were associated with shorter PFS. For pts with both POD24 and high TMTV (n=12), the CRR was 16.7% with a 12-mo PFS of 36.0%. These analyses of high-risk subgroups are exploratory in nature and should be validated in a larger study cohort. Conclusions : With 17-mo median follow-up, tisagenlecleucel produced high ORR and CRR and was associated with durable response and promising 12-mo PFS in pts with r/r FL and 2+ prior lines of therapy. Safety was consistent with known tisagenlecleucel profile. POD24 and high TMTV were independently associated with PFS. These results suggest that tisagenlecleucel can induce high rates of durable response, including most pts in the high-risk disease subgroups, who have poor prognosis with current non-CAR-T cell therapies.
