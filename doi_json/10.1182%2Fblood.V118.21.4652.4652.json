    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4652 [Introduction] Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is often found in patients with infections, leukemia, solid tumors, trauma, aneurysms or obstetricdiseases. The causes of DIC associated with leukemia are considered to be an elevated expression of tissue factor, tissue type plasminogen activator or anexin II in leukemic cells. The factors thought to be responsible for DIC associated with sepsis are an elevated inflammatory response, including an increased production of inflammatory cytokines. [Materials and Methods] In this study, 692 patients with suspected DIC were prospectively evaluated for various types of underlying diseases using the DIC diagnostic criteria established by International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) and Japanese Ministry Health Labor and Welfare (JMHLW), and the usefulness of hemostatic markers were examined for each patient with DIC due to various underlying diseases. [Results] The main underlying disease of DIC was infectious diseases, hematologic malignancies, and solid tumors, and a high resolution rate from DIC was observed in obstetric diseases and hematologic malignancies. The diagnosis of DIC was related to a poor outcome in trauma/burn victims and those with infectious disease. In the main underlying disease, it is suggested that DIC would be excluded in patients with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors with a platelet count of more than 1\u00d710 8 /ml and in the patients with fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products (FDP) of less than 10 mg/L, and fibrinogen of less than 100 mg/dl, suggesting the presence of DIC. The prothrombin time was a sensitive marker, but fibrinogen levels were not sensitive for DIC due to infectious diseases. The plasmin plasmin inhibitor complex in hematologic malignancy, and soluble fibrin monomer complex, antithrombin and thrombomodulin in patients with infectious disease, were sensitive markers for the diagnosis of DIC. [Discussion and conclusion] Although hemostatic markers were useful for the diagnosis of DIC, the usefulness varied depending on the different underlying diseases. The global coagulation tests are therefore considered to be useful for the diagnosis of DIC, and hemostatic molecular markers are useful for examining the pathophysiology of patients with DIC.
