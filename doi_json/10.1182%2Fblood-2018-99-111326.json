    "abstract_text": "Introduction: CYAD-01 is a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) product based on the receptor NKG2D with specificity for a broad range of ligands (MICA, MICB and ULBP1-6) expressed on most tumors. In vivo preclinical studies showed long-term anti-tumor activity of CYAD-01, whilst not only targeting tumor cells but also cells from the tumor neo-vasculature and immunosuppressive environment in the absence of pre-conditioning therapy. Methods: Exploiting this unique mode of action of CYAD-01, the THINK trial (NCT03018405) is an open-label Phase I study assessing the safety and clinical activity of multiple CYAD-01 administrations without prior preconditioning in 2 parallel cohorts: one in patients (pt) with metastatic solid tumors and the other one in hematological malignancies, including relapsing/refractory (r/r) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The dose escalation segment of the study evaluates 3 dose levels (DL; 3x10 8 , 1x10 9 and 3x10 9 cells per injection) of one cycle of 3 CYAD-01 administration with 2-weeks intervals. The study has been amended at the stage of DL-2 to authorize a second cycle of 3 CYAD-01 administrations in case of no progressive disease after 2 months. Results: As of July 31, 2018, 12 pts in the hematological cohort (8 AML, 3 MM and 1 MDS) have been enrolled at the 3 DLs (6 pts in DL-1, 3 in DL-2 and 3 in DL-3) without prior preconditioning. Median age was 64 (range 29-83) and median number of prior therapies was 3. DL-3 (3 pts) has been fully accrued as of data cutoff. Over 34 injections, 5 pts experienced grade (G) 3/4 treatment-related AEs: in DL-1, one pt experienced G3 lymphopenia and a second pt experienced G4 lymphopenia and G4 pneumonitis in DL-2, one pt experienced G3 lymphopenia and G3 thrombocytopenia and two other pts experienced G3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Treatment related AEs occurring in \u2265 1pt include pyrexia, CRS, hypoxia, lymphopenia, fatigue and nausea. CRS occurred in 5 pts, three G1/2 and two G3 AEs, with rapid resolution to appropriate treatment including tocilizumab. No neurotoxicity AEs have been observed to date. Out of the 8 r/r AML pts enrolled, 7 were response evaluable (2 at DL-1, 3 at DL-2 and 2 at DL-3). The third DL-3 pt has just initiated the first cycle of CYAD-01 treatment. Overall response rate in r/r AML pts was 42% (3/7 patients) with 1 complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CR h ) in DL-1 and 2 CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CR i ; 1 in DL-1 and 1 in DL-3). All responding pts achieved response by day 29 (i.e. after 2 CYAD-01 administrations). The AML pt with CR h in DL-1 was bridged to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) on day +97 post CYAD-01 and is in durable complete molecular remission (CR MRD- ) for more than 1 year (ongoing). The two other responding pts had CR i for 1 month. Two other AML patients at DL-2 had clinical benefit/disease stabilization with hematologic improvement and bone marrow blasts decrease: one pt for 3 months and with a decrease from 24% to 10% and the second pt for at least 4 months (ongoing) and with a decrease from 9.8% to 5.5%. The first patient in CR h had a relative increase in the systemic levels of SDF-1, RANTES and MCP-1 which correlated with the timing of injections. CYAD-01 engraftment kinetics, NKG2D ligand expression (including blasts and soluble ligand expression), and the kinetics of cytokine induction will be correlated with patient's responses. The 3 MM and the MDS pt, all in DL-1, did not present any sign of clinical activity. Conclusions: We have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of multiple injections of CYAD-01 without preconditioning chemotherapy. We evidenced promising anti-leukemic activity with 42% ORR in r/r AML with 5/7 pts having clinical benefit. Rates of G3/4 CRS were low and manageable. Updated safety, activity and correlative science data of the complete dose-escalation segment will be presented. Disclosures Sallman: Celgene: Research Funding, Speakers Bureau.
