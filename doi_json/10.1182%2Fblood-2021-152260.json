    "abstract_text": "Background The primary analysis of the HD16 trial initiated in 2018 found that, in the treatment of early-stage favorable Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), involved-field radiotherapy (IF-RT) cannot be omitted from standard combined-modality treatment (CMT) without a clinically significant loss of tumor control. We thus complement the published analysis with prolonged follow-up and data on long-term toxicity. Methods Between 11/2009 and 12/2015, we enrolled 1150 patients aged 18-75 years with newly diagnosed HL in stages I or II without risk factors. Patients were randomized between standard CMT, with 2 cycles of ABVD followed by a centrally reviewed PET/CT-based restaging (PET-2) and 20 Gy IF-RT regardless of PET-2 result, and PET-2-guided treatment, with 2 cycles ABVD followed by 20 Gy IF-RT only in case of a positive PET-2 in terms of a Deauville score (DS) \u22653. Primary endpoint was PFS, analyzed according to Kaplan-Meier using Cox regression and log-rank test as applicable. We aimed at excluding inferiority of the PET-2-guided regimen in terms of a Hazard ratio (HR) of 3.01 or above in the PET-2-negative per-protocol cohort. Another aim was to assess the prognostic impact of PET-2 among those patients assigned to receive CMT. This follow-up analysis aims at repeating the main analyses with prolonged follow-up and complement efficacy results with long-term safety data. Findings With a median follow-up of 64 months, PET-2-negative patients had five-year PFS of 94.2% (95% CI 91.6-96.9) after CMT (n=328) and 86.7% (82.5-90.9) after ABVD alone in the PET-2-guided treatment group (n=300; HR 2.05 [1.20-3.51] including the non-inferiority margin; log-rank p=0.0072). The difference primarily resulted from recurrences that were at least in part located within the potential radiation field, with 5-year cumulative incidences of 2.0% (0.4-3.7) after CMT vs. 10.4% (6.7-14.1) after ABVD alone (p=0.0002). There was no difference regarding second primary malignancies, with 5-year cumulative incidences of 4.6% (2.1-7.1) after CMT vs. 4.2% (1.6-6.8) after ABVD (p=0.57). Five-year overall survival was 98.3% (96.9-99.8) and 98.8% (97.4-100), respectively (p=0.14), with 4 of the 12 documented deaths caused by second primary malignancies and only 1 by HL. Among patients assigned to receive CMT, PFS was superior in the PET-2-negative subgroup (DS 1-2) (n=353; 5-year PFS 94.0% [91.4-96.6]) compared with those having DS \u22653 (n=340; 90.3% [86.9-93.6]; p=0.012). The difference was more pronounced when the more commonly used cutoff of DS 4 was used for positivity (DS 1-3: n=571; 94.0% [91.9-96.0] vs. DS \u22654: n=122; 83.6% [76.6-90.6]; p<0.0001). OS was not impaired in PET-2-positive patients (DS 1-3: 98.8% [97.9-99.8] vs. DS \u22654: 97.2% [94.1-100]; p=0.98). After 5 years of follow-up, cardiac parameters showed normal outcomes in both randomized treatment groups and no relevant decrease compared with baseline values. Among 293 female patients aged 18-40 years at enrollment, the 5-year incidence of childbirth after therapy was 24.0% (15.9-32.2) after standard CMT vs. 17.9% (10.4-25.5) after PET-guided treatment. Conclusion We conclude that radiotherapy cannot be omitted from the treatment of early-stage favorable HL after a negative PET-2 without a clinically relevant and statistically significant loss of efficacy. We could not observe any disadvantage of standard CMT over PET-guided therapy in terms of acute or late toxicities. Overall survival is on a high level and not impaired by the omission of radiotherapy due to effective second-line therapies. Noteworthy the results of the HD16 trial became more pronounced with longer follow-up. This holds true for the per-protocol as well as for the intention-to-treat group. A positive PET after 2 cycles of ABVD in terms of DS \u22654 is associated with significantly inferior efficacy compared with a negative PET, indicating the need for further improvement in this group of patients. Taken together, we recommend that CMT is to be regarded as standard treatment for early-stage favorable HL.
