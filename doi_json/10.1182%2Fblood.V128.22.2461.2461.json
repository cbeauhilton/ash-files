    "abstract_text": "Objective: Iron overload is common in patients with acute leukemia who undergoing allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We performed a comprehensive analysis of iron parameters to assess these patients' iron metabolism, and studied the prognostic impact of pretransplant iron overload on the outcome of transplantation. Methods: In this retrospective study, we studied 124 patients undergoing myeloablative allo-HSCT between 2012 and 2014. Serum iron (SI), serum ferritin (SF), hepcidin (Hepc) and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) were measured before transplant. We analyzed the effect of elevated pretransplant ferritin on acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD), infectious complications, overall survival (OS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM). Results: Date of 124 patients (including 56 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia and 68 cases of acute myeloid leukemia) were analyzed. Median SI, SF, Hepc and sTfR values were 12.15 umol/L, 667.05 ng/ml, 369.50 ng/L and 7.69 ng/ml, respectively. Iron overload (defined as SF>1000 ng/ml) were observed in 27.42% of patients. Pretransplant iron overload was significantly associated with increased risk of bacterial infections during the early post-transplant period, and with reduced risk of aGVHD. Pretransplant iron overload increased NRM and reduced OS, but there were no significant differences. Conclusion: Patients with acute leukemia regularly develop iron overload before they undergoing allo-HSCT. Pretransplant iron overload was correlated with transplantation outcome.
