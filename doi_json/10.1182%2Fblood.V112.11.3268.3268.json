    "abstract_text": "We retrospectively assessed 1) overall platelet (PLT) and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirements within the first 100 days after allogeneic among HCT recipients given either nonmyeloablative (n=365) or myeloablative conditioning (n=1430); 2) transfusion requirements among nonmyeloablative recipients given grafts from related (n=187) vs. unrelated donors (n=178), and grafts from ABO matched (n=203) vs. ABO mismatched donors (n=159); and 3) the impact of ABO incompatibility on HCT outcomes among nonmyeloablative recipients. Table 1 summarizes results. We confirmed that myeloablative recipients were more likely to receive both PLT and RBC transfusions than nonmyeloablative recipients (both p<0.0001). Subsequent analyses were restricted to nonmyeloablative recipients. Both PLT and RBC transfusion requirements were increased among recipients of unrelated grafts (both p<0.0001) and those with major or bi-directional ABO mismatched grafts (p = 0.019 and p=0.003, respectively). No statistically significant differences were observed in cumulative incidences of graft rejection/failure, grades II-IV acute GVHD and in 3-year survivals between ABO-matched, minor-mismatched, and major/bidirectional mismatched pts ( p =0.89, 0.48, and 0.49, respectively). Times to disappearance of anti-donor IgM and IgG isohemagglutinins were not statistically significantly different among major or bi-directional ABO mismatched related (43 days for both) vs. unrelated recipients (58 and 57 days, p =0.20 and 0.27, respectively). Major/bidirectional ABO-mismatched recipients with grades II-IV vs. 0\u2013I acute GVHD had comparable likelihoods of reaching IgM ( p =0.20) and IgG ( p =0.63) titer endpoints. In conclusion, nonmyeloablative pts had reduced PLT and RBC transfusion requirements compared to myeloablative pts. Among nonmyeloablative pts, unrelated ( vs . related) grafts and ABO-incompatibility ( vs . ABO compatibility) between donors and recipients led to increased PLT and RBC transfusion requirements. ABO incompatibility did not increase graft rejection nor GVHD or adversely affect survival after non-myeloablative HCT. The tempo of disappearance of anti-donor isohemagglutinin titers was not influenced by donor type or occurrence of GVHD. Table 1.
