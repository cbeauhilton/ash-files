    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND The recent approval of novel agents (NAs) has changed the treatment landscape in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), however, there remains uncertainty regarding treatment discontinuation patterns in real-world (RW) settings. This study assessed patterns of and reasons for discontinuation for patients (pts) treated with chemotherapy/chemoimmunotherapy (CT/CIT) and NAs in first (1L) and second (2L) lines of therapy in CLL. METHODS The CLL Collaborative Study of Real-World Evidence (CORE) study is a retrospective, multicenter, observational study. Adult CLL patients (pts) were included if they were diagnosed with CLL, initiated 1L or 2L therapy for CLL on/after 01/01/2012 (excluding lines of therapy received as part of clinical trials). Discontinuation patterns were assessed among CT/CIT and NAs, more specifically in four treatment cohorts: fludarabine+cyclophosphamide+rituximab ( FCR ), bendamustine+rituximab ( BR ), B-cell receptor inhibitors ( BCRi ) - based (e.g., acalabrutinib, ibrutinib, or idelalisib) and venetoclax - based regimens. Treatment discontinuation was operationally defined as ending therapy for reason(s) other than completion of planned duration of therapy. RESULTS Of 671 pts receiving 1L therapy, 81 (12%) received FCR (median age=58, 70% males); 153 (23%) BR (median age=63, 61% males), 255 (38%) BCRi-based (median age=65, 65% males); and 13 (2%) venetoclax-based (median age=59, 54% males). The remaining 169 pts received other regimens (e.g., other CT/CIT). The most common BCRi-based therapy in 1L was ibrutinib-containing regimens (97%). Median duration of follow-up was 24, 27, 11 and 8 months for FCR, BR, BCRi-based and venetoclax-based regimens, respectively. Treatment discontinuation occurred in 18 (22%), 41 (27%), 51 (20%) and 4/13 pts receiving FCR, BR, BCRi-based and venetoclax-based regimens, respectively. The most common reason for discontinuation in FCR (11/18 pts; 61%), BR (15/41 pts; 37%) and BCRi-based (24/51 pts; 47%) cohorts was adverse events (AEs), with >70% being severe AEs in each cohort. Common AEs leading to discontinuations were hematological abnormalities (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) in the FCR (6/18 pts; 33%) and BR (6/41 pts; 15%) cohorts. In the BCRi-based cohort the most common AEs leading to discontinuations were cardiac (4/51 pts; 8%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (e.g., rash; 6/51 pts; 12%), hemorrhage/bleeding (3/51; 6%), and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (3/51; pts; 6%). For the relatively small number of pts treated with venetoclax-based regimens and discontinued, disease progression was the common reason for discontinuations (3/4 pts); no pts discontinued venetoclax-based regimens due to adverse events. In the relapsed/refractory setting specifically in 2L, 15 (7%), 113 (56%) and 16 (8%) pts received BR, BCRi-based and venetoclax-based regimen respectively, of which the most common BCRi-based therapy regimen was ibrutinib-based (95%). Treatment discontinuation occurred in 5/15 pts (33%), 27/113 pts (24%) and 4/16 pts (25%) receiving BR, BCRi-based and venetoclax-based regimens, respectively. The most common reason for discontinuations were severe AEs for BR (3/5 pts) and BCRi-based (13/27 pts) cohorts and disease progression for venetoclax-based regimens (2/4). CONCLUSIONS Despite the relatively short follow-up, in both 1L and 2L, similar discontinuation patterns emerge. CT/CIT is often discontinued prior to completion of planned cycles of therapy, suggesting that these regimens are difficult to tolerate. Additionally, treat to progression BCRi-based regimens are also discontinued for severe AEs, discordant to results from clinical trials. With a small cohort and limited information collected, results on venetoclax discontinuation warrants additional studies. Well tolerated chemotherapy-free combinations with finite treatment duration in treatment na\u00efve and relapsed/refractory settings may limit continuous exposure to treatment and prevent discontinuations due to AEs.
