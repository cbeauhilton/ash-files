    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4745 To observe how did the allogeneic NK cells kill human multiple myeloma cell RPMI-8266 and the immune mechanisms why RPMI-8266 cells escape from the NK cytotoxicity. Methods Detect the cytotoxicity of NK cells against RPMI 8226 cells by LDH release assay at different effect-to-target cell ratios in vitro, K562, high-sensitive with NK cells,was control cell. Test the expression of MHC-\u00b1 chain-related molecules (MICA/B), human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein UL16-binding protein (ULBP1-3) and HLA -\u00b1 MHC molecules on K562 and RPMI-8266 cell by flow cytometry. Detect mRNA level of MICA / B and ULBP1 \u223c 3 in K562, RPMI-266, and KIR genotyping of NK cell from 9 cases of healthy volunteers' by PCR method. As the E:T was 20:1, we used AMO-1, BMO-1, M295, M310, M551 and W6/32 mAb to block the effect of cell-surface protein MICA, MICB, ULBP1, ULBP2, ULBP3 and HLA-\u00b1 in K562 and RPMI-8266 cell respectively, then observe the change of cytotoxicity of NK cells on K562 and RPMI-8266 cell. Results When the E:T was 5:1, cytotoxicity of NK cells on K562 and RPMI-8266 were (29.52 \u00b1 0.27)% and (2.15 \u00b1 0.32)% respectively; As the E:T was 10:1, the cytotoxicity were (36.37 \u00b1 0.78) % and (5.26 \u00b1 0.84)%; As the E:T was 20:1, they were (59.57 \u00b1 1.05)% and (7.63 \u00b1 1.05)%; As the E:T was 40:1, they were (70.64 \u00b1 1.34)% and (10.18 \u00b1 1.53)%. There wre significantly difference of the cytotoxicity of NK cell between on RPMI-8266 and K562 at all E:T ratio(P  0.05); But as we bloked HLA -\u00b1 molecules with W6/32 monoclonal antibody, the cytotoxicity of NK cell on RPMI-8266 increased to (48.77 \u00b1 4.61)%, there were significant differences between before and after bloking (P <0.05). Conclusion For 8266 cell, the mechanisms of immune escape from NK killing effect may be related to high expression of HLA -\u00b1 molecule, and did not express the NKG2D ligands MICA / B and ULBP1 \u223c 3 molecules.
