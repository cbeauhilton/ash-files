    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogenous group of diseases characterized by a clonal proliferation of myeloid progenitors. Its poor prognosis with conventional chemotherapy justifies seeking for adjuvant immunotherapeutic approaches to eliminate minimal residual disease. We evaluated an immunotherapeutic strategy that bypass the need for epitope identification and the limitation due to HLA restriction. Naturally processed peptides were extracted by acid elution from AML cells at diagnosis, and loaded on mature dendritic cells (mDCs) derived from autologous monocytes obtained when the patients were in complete remission (CR). We evaluated i) the feasibility to elute naturally processed peptides from AML cells at diagnosis, ii) the capacity of mDCs loaded with eluted peptides (mDC/EP) to stimulate specific T cell lines in vitro. We showed that stimulation by mDC/EP was able to generate anti-leukemic T cells lines from PBMC of 6 AML patients in CR. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were isolated from T cell lines of 5 patients and analyzed for their proliferation, INF-\u03b3 production and cytotoxicity in response to autologous or allogeneic AML targets, or to normal autologous PBMC. We showed that both CD4+ and CD8+ leukemia-specific T cells were generated in vitro by mDC/EP stimulations since proliferation of CD4+ T cells, IFN-\u03b3 secretion by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and cytotoxicity mediated by CD8+ T cells were induced in response to stimulation with autologous AML cells. Furthermore, we could not detect auto-immune recognition of autologous normal PBMC, consistent with the specificity of the T cell response induced by mDC/EP. These results provide the proof of concept for using mDC/EP to vaccinate patients with poor-risk AML, and will soon be evaluated in a phse I/II clinical trial.",
