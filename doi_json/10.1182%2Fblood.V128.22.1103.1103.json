    "abstract_text": "Background: A new subcutaneous formulation of rituximab (R SC ) has been developed which offers reduced treatment burden for patients compared to intravenous rituximab (R IV ) as well as resource savings at the treatment facility. Additionally, availability of R SC would potentially allow patients to be treated primarily IV-free with orally administered partner therapies. The Phase 3 SABRINA study (NCT01200758) investigated induction R IV or R SC plus chemotherapy followed by maintenance R IV or R SC in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). Pharmacokinetic non-inferiority was previously reported for R SC (1400mg) compared with R IV (375mg/m 2 ) as well as comparable efficacy and safety (Davies et al . Lancet Oncol 2014;15:343-52; Davies, et al . Haematologica 2015;100:P687). Here we present updated efficacy and safety results including overall response rates (ORR) at the end of maintenance and time to event (progression-free [PFS], overall [OS], and event-free [EFS] survival) data with a median follow-up of 37 months. Methods: Patients with treatment-na\u00efve CD20+ grade 1-3a FL (n=410) were randomized to receive R IV or R SC , stratified by FL International Prognostic Index score, chemotherapy regimen, and region. All patients received R IV 375mg/m 2 in Cycle 1; for Cycles 2-8, patients received R IV 375mg/m 2 or R SC 1400mg every 3 weeks. Patients received \u22648 cycles of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) or 8 cycles of CVP ( cyclophosphamide , vincristine and prednisone). During maintenance, patients received R IV or R SC every 8 weeks for 2 years. Non-serious adverse events (AEs) were reported for 28 days following the last dose of rituximab. Serious AEs (SAEs) were recorded for 1 year post-treatment or until the start of new anti-lymphoma treatment. SAEs considered possibly related to study treatment were recorded indefinitely. Results: Based on investigator assessments for the intent-to-treat population (R IV n=205; R SC n=205), ORR at the end of maintenance was comparable between treatment arms: (78.1%, 95% CI [71.3, 83.9] for R IV vs. 77.9%, 95% CI [71.0, 83.9] for R SC ) (Table 1). Analyses of the time-to-event endpoints PFS (HR, 0.84, 95% CI [0.57, 1.23]) (Fig.1), EFS (HR, 0.91, 95% CI [0.64, 1.31), and OS (HR, 0.81, 95% CI [0.42, 1.57) showed no differences in efficacy for the SC vs. the IV formulation. In total, 407 patients received \u22651 dose of rituximab (safety population). Six R SC patients discontinued treatment after Cycle 1 (R IV in both arms) and were included in the R IV safety population (R IV n=210; R SC n=197); 86% of patients started maintenance (R IV n=178, 85%; R SC n=172, 87%). Overall, there were similar incidences of patients with \u22651 AE (95% vs. 96%), grade \u22653 AEs (55% and 56%), and SAEs (34% and 37%) for R IV vs. R SC , respectively (Table 2). The most frequent AEs reported overall (R IV vs. R SC ) were neutropenia (27% vs. 32%), nausea (22% vs. 31%), constipation (26% vs. 25%), cough (13% vs. 23%), and fatigue (18% vs. 20%). The most frequently reported AEs during the maintenance phase of the study were upper respiratory tract infection (7% vs. 11%) and cough (11% vs. 12%) for R IV vs. R SC , respectively. Overall, AEs associated with B-cell depletion, including neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and grade \u22653 infections, were balanced between the SC and IV treatment arms. The change in route of administration led to an expected higher incidence of local cutaneous reactions in the R SC arm (2% R IV vs. 23% R SC ) with injection site erythema, injection site pain, and rash being most frequently reported. All reported events, except for 1 AE of injection site rash in the R SC arm at Cycle 2, were of mild or moderate intensity (grade \u22642). Incidence of local cutaneous reactions decreased over subsequent treatment cycles. At data cut-off, 36 deaths had been reported: 20 (9.8%) in the R IV arm and 16 (7.8%) in the R SC arm. Conclusions: Overall, there were no new clinically relevant safety signals observed with R SC and the safety profile was comparable to that of R IV . Response rates as well as PFS and OS data for rituximab SC were comparable to rituximab IV and indicate that the anti-lymphoma activity of rituximab is not impaired when given subcutaneously. The availability of R SC administration over approximately 6 minutes has positive implications for patient and healthcare professional convenience, as well as healthcare resource savings, without compromising efficacy or safety.
