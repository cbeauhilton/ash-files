    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Blood coagulation analysis is routinely performed to assess bleeding and thrombotic risks in surgical and critical care patients as well as in patients with diseases that cause coagulation abnormalities (e.g., hemophilia, thrombophilia and sickle cell disease). Majority of coagulation assays are based on photo-optical measurement of coagulation onset in blood plasma such as prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and viscoelastic measurement of coagulating whole blood, often referred to as \"global coagulation analysis\", mostly done by thromboelastography (TEG, ROTEM) but they require large sample volume (> 0.5ml) requiring venipuncture, have poor standardization, and are unreliable tools to predict bleeding/thrombotic risk. Acoustic tweezing coagulometry (ATC) is an innovative noncontact drop-of-blood coagulation analysis technique that can perform both photo-optical and viscoelastic coagulation analysis with a sample volume as low as 4 \u03bcl to provide a comprehensive set of clinically relevant coagulation parameters such as blood viscosity, elasticity, reaction time, clotting rate, maximum clot stiffness, fibrin formation rate and cross-linking kinetics helpful for diagnosis and prediction of bleeding and thrombotic risks. ATC is particularly valuable for the pediatric patients as it enables safe and reliable point of care coagulation assessment with minimal sample volume. Materials and Methods: In this project, we demonstrate the feasibility of ATC for coagulation analysis by validation and standardization of the technique using whole blood collected from healthy adult volunteers and commercially purchased blood plasma. Further, we present the ability of ATC to assess bleeding risk in commercial blood plasma with coagulation FVIII deficiency with and without inhibitors, as well as whole blood collected from pediatric Hemophilia A patients without inhibitors. The time dependent changes in elasticity (elastic tweezograph, Figure 1A) and viscosity (viscous tweezograph, Figure 1B) of coagulating blood plasma or whole blood sample are used to extract the following coagulation parameters: clot initiation time (CIT), clotting rate (CR), clotting time (CT), time to firm clot formation (TFCF), and maximum clot stiffness (MCS) from elastic tweezograph; reaction time (RT), fibrin formation rate (FFR), and maximum fibrin level (MFL) from viscous tweezograph. Results and Discussion: Figure 1C shows the elastic tweezograph and figure 1D shows the viscous tweezograph of the healthy plasma, plasma with coagulation FVIII deficieny and plasma with inhibitors for coagulation FVIII activated via the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. The tweezographs suggest that the clot initiation is faster in healthy plasma compared to the FVIII deficient plasma and FVIII inhibitor plasma. The clotting rate is highest for healthy plasma followed by the FVIII deficient plasma and is the lowest for the plasma with FVIII inhibitors suggesting a delayed clot formation in the deficient and inhibitor groups. They all reach a similar final clot stiffness, but the time to firm clot formation is least in healthy plasma as expected and increases in the FVIII deficient group and further increases in the FVIII inhibitor group. Conclusions: Acoustic tweezing coagulometry can successfully measure the viscosity, elasticity and coagulation of whole blood and blood plasma with only a drop of the sample. This technique can successfully assess the bleeding risks in pediatric and adult patients with Hemophilia.
