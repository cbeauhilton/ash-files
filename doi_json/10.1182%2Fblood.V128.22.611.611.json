    "abstract_text": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a mature B-cell lymphoma characterized by poor prognosis. Recent studies revealed the importance of constitutive B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in maintaining survival of a subset of MCLs. MALT1 is an essential component of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex that links BCR signaling to the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) pathway. Additionally, MALT1 functions as a protease that cleaves various substrates to promote proliferation and survival. However, its role in the molecular pathogenesis of MCL is unknown. To elucidate the functional role of MALT1 in the biology of MCL, we determined its proteolytic activity in primary MCL cells and in MCL derived cell lines. A large fraction of MCLs displayed constitutive activity of MALT1. This MALT1 activity is driven by constitutive BCR signaling, as we were able to show that RNA interference-mediated knockdown of central components of the BCR cascade abolished MALT1 activity. To gain insights into the functional significance of MALT1 in MCL, we knocked down its expression by different MALT1 shRNAs. Transduction of these shRNAs induced cytotoxicity in models that are characterized by constitutive MALT1 activity, whereas no effect on survival was observable in MCLs without MALT1 activation. To determine if this MALT1 addiction translates into an in vivo setting, we knocked down MALT1 in mouse MCL models and detected a significant inhibition of tumor growth. This indicates that MALT1-activated MCLs are dependent on the function of MALT1. These results were confirmed as pharmacologic inhibition of MALT1 significantly reduced cell viability in MALT1-activated MCLs, implying that MALT1 inhibition might represent a promising therapeutic strategy for MCL patients. To understand which biologic processes are regulated by MALT1 in MCL, we profiled gene expression changes at different time points following MALT1 inhibition. An unbiased gene set enrichment analysis identified various previously described MYC gene expression signatures to be among the top downregulated signatures, suggesting that MALT1 regulates MYC expression. MYC downregulation following MALT1 inhibition or MALT1 knockdown was confirmed at the protein level and various analyses revealed that MALT1 regulates MYC expression posttranslationally by preventing its proteasomal degradation. These results were further confirmed in primary mouse splenocytes, indicating that this novel molecular mechanism of regulating MYC expression is not restricted to MCL. To confirm that MYC is indeed expressed in primary MCLs, we determined MYC expression in 234 primary MCL samples by immunohistochemistry. These analyses revealed that 75 samples (32.1%) displayed an intermediate and 55 samples (23.5%) a high MYC positivity, suggesting that MYC is expressed in a substantial number of primary MCLs. As common alterations such as MYC high-levelamplifications and translocations determined by FISH occurred extremely rarely in our primary MCL samples (1% of samples), it is conceivable that BCR-driven MALT1 signaling is the predominant mechanism of MYC upregulation in MCL. In summary, we report for the first time that a substantial fraction of MCLs is addicted to constitutive MALT1 signaling. Thus, MCLs can be divided based on their MALT1 activation status into two distinct subgroups. We further identified a novel regulatory mechanism of MYC expression by MALT1. Thus, our study provides a strong mechanistic rationale to investigate the therapeutic efficacy in targeting the MALT1-MYC axis in MCL patients.
