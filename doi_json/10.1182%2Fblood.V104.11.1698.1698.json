    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are difficult to expand in vitro since expansion media mostly include exogenous factor, e.g., cytokines. Growth factors cause lineage commitment with the HSC exhibiting short-term immune reconstitution. The recently cloned HGFIN (or nmb ) gene has been detected in CD34 + /CD38 \u2212 and differentiated immune cells. HGFIN is a single transmembrane protein with multiple consensus regions for p53. In malignant cells, HGFIN mediate tumor progression and in normal cells, HGFIN maintain cell cycle quiescence. We hypothesize that HGFIN negatively regulates proliferation of HSC by prolonging the G 0 phase. Short-term knockdown of HGFIN in HSC could cause the cells to exit G 0 /G 1 phase so as to accommodate the insertion of a replacement gene, without changing the pluripotent property of HSC. RT-PCR detected HGFIN mRNA in CD34 + /CD38 \u2212 cells, but not in CD34 + /CD38 + cells from bone marrow (BM) aspirates. Treatment of CD34 + /CD38 \u2212 cells with double stranded HGFIN siRNA oligos for 2 h led to their exit from G 1 to G 2 /S (flow cytometry). During this time, adenovirus-LacZ (\u00df-galactosidase assay) was incorporated in >80% CD34 + /CD38 \u2212 cells, compared to 10\u201320% exposed to mutant siRNA, or untreated. After 24 h exposure to siRNA oligos, the CD34 + /CD38 \u2212 cells reverted to G 0/1 phase. The latter cells (with adenovirus-LacZ) were studied in 12-wk long-term culture initiating assay. The results (\u00df-gal positive progenies) from the LTC-IC assay indicate that despite siRNA treatment, the CD34 + /CD38 \u2212 cells retained multipotential properties. Future investigations with specific HGFIN antibody will map pathways among HGFIN and other molecules that regulate cell cycle progression in CD34 + /CD38 \u2212 cells. In summary, the results show that HGFIN regulate cell cycle quiescence of CD34 + /CD38 \u2212 cells. Transient knock down of HGFIN in these cells allow adenovirus to be inserted without loss of multipotential properties. Understanding the biology of HSC at the molecular level will be relevant to HSC expansion and restoration of immune competence via gene therapy.",
