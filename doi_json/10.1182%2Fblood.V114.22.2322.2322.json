We investigated the effectiveness of PAD (PS-341/Bortezomib, Adriamycin and Dexamethasone) and the feasibility of harvesting peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and performing AHCT after 2 cycles of PAD in newly diagnosed MM. Patients and Methods: Patients received two 21-day cycles of PAD consisting of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m 2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; adriamycin 9 mg/m 2 on days 1-4; and dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4 and 8-11. For mobilization of PBSC, G-CSF 10 mcg/kg was given subcutaneously for 4 days starting on day 12 of the second cycle of PAD. Following PBSC harvesting, AHCT was performed with a conditioning therapy of high-dose melphalan. Thalidomide 100-200 mg/d was given following AHCT. Results: Between April 2005 and October 2008, a total of 32 previously untreated patients, 18 males and 14 females, with symptomatic MM were enrolled into this study. Median age was 58.5 years (range, 44-69). Durie-Salmon stage was 1A in 3 (9.4%), 2A in 7 (21.9%), 3A in 19 (59.4%), and 3B in 3 (9.4%), while SWOG stage was I in 4 (12.5%), II in 18 (56.3%), III in 6 (18.8%), IV in 2 (6.3%), and unknown in 2 (6.3%). Of 31 patients who completed 2 planned cycles of PAD chemotherapy, 25 (80.6%) showed PR or better responses: CR in 6 (19.4%), VGPR in 5 (16.1%), and PR in 14 (45.2%). Severe (grade 3 or 4) non-hematologic toxicities after PAD were uncommon and included transient elevation of AST/ALT (3.2%), while severe hematologic toxicities were common (anemia, 4.8%; neutropenia, 38.1%; thrombocytopenia, 47.6%). All but two patients, who were removed from the study before PBSC collection, successfully mobilized PBSC with G-CSF for a median collection number of 3 (range, 2-7). The second attempt of PBSC collection was needed in 7 patients. Median number of collected CD34+ cells was 9.2 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (range, 4.4-30.1). Thirty patients underwent AHCT on a median day of 73 (range, 50-126) from the first cycle of PAD. Tandem AHCT was performed in one patient. Median number of infused CD34+ cells was 7.6 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (range, 4.4-18.5). Melphalan dose for conditioning therapy was 200 mg/m 2 in 26 patients, 140 mg/m 2 in one, and 120 mg/m 2 in three. All patients showed adequate hematologic recovery after AHCT with a median day of 12 (range, 11-38) for neutrophils > 500/mcL and a median day of 17 (range, 10-54) for platelets > 20,000/mcL. Response after AHCT was CR in 14 (46.7%), VGPR in 8 (26.7%), PR in 6 (20.0%), SD in 1 (3.1%), and PD in 1 (3.1%). Thalidomide was given to 24 patients after AHCT as maintenance therapy. The median interval to starting thalidomide from AHCT was 61 days (range, 32-206) and the median duration of thalidomide administration was 283.5 days (range, 2-741). Nine patients showed better response after thalidomide (VGPR \u2192 CR in 4, PR \u2192 CR in 1, SD \u2192 CR in 1, PR \u2192 VGPR in 3, and PD \u2192 PR in 1), thus after all, 20 patients (66.7%) achieved CR. With a median follow-up duration of 736 days (range, 178-1398) among surviving patients, 14 patients progressed and 6 died. Probabilities of overall and progression-free survival (PFS) were 62.5% and 32.7% at 3 years, respectively. PFS was significantly longer in patients receiving thalidomide after AHCT compared to those not receiving thalidomide (41.5% vs. 0% at 3 years, P & 0.001). Conclusion: Our study results confirmed excellent activity of PAD in newly diagnosed MM patients and showed that adequate harvesting and autografting of PBSC after 2 cycles of PAD chemotherapy was feasible. Post-transplant maintenance of thalidomide appears to be beneficial in preventing disease progression after AHCT. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
