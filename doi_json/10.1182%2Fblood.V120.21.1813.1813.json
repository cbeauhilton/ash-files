    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1813 Multiple myeloma is an incurable malignancy, and excessive bone destruction is a major cause of morbidity in myeloma patients. However, the biologic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of myeloma-induced bone disease are poorly understood. Heparanase, an enzyme that cleaves the heparan sulfate chains of proteoglycans, is upregulated in a variety of human tumors, including myeloma. In the present study, bone marrow biopsies from 40 myeloma patients were stained with antibodies raised against heparanase, RANKL (an osteoclastogenic cytokine), OPG (a decoy receptor for RANKL), TRAP (a marker of osteoclastogenesis) and osteocalcin (a marker of osteoblastogenesis). The radiologic studies for bone lesions of these patients were also recorded. We analyzed the correlations between heparanase expression in bone marrow myeloma cells with (1) the numbers of TRAP positive osteoclasts, (2) RANKL and OPG expression in myeloma cells and osteoblastic cells, (3) the numbers of osteocalcin positive osteoblasts in bone marrow, and (4) the presence/absence of lytic bone lesions. We found a positive correlation between heparanase expression and RANKL expression as well as the numbers of TRAP positive osteoclasts in myeloma and bone marrow cells, but no correlation was found between the expressions of heparanase and OPG in bone marrow cells (myeloma cells do not express OPG). In contrast, heparanase expression was negatively correlated with the numbers of osteocalcin positive osteoblasts. Taken together, these data suggest that heparanase expression by myeloma cells promotes osteoclastogenesis and at same time inhibits osteoblastogenesis. Clinical data show that 92% of patients with high level of heparanase had one or more lytic bone lesions, while only 63% of patients with median\u223c low levels of heparanase had bone lesions (p<0.0001). In summary, enhanced heparanase expression in myeloma cells promotes bone resorption and inhibits bone formation; these events contribute to the uncontrolled bone destruction that is characteristic of myeloma. These data provide novel insight into the mechanisms driving myeloma bone disease and suggest that heparanase inhibitors are valid therapeutic targets for the treatment of multiple myeloma.
