    "abstract_text": "DAC is a potent hypomethylating agent with clinical activity in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). VPA is a histone deacetylase inhibitor used as an antiepileptic agent. In vitro, the combination of DAC with VPA results in synergistic antileukemia activity at doses of VPA above 1mM. Based on this data, we have developed a phase I/II study of this combination for pts with leukemia. The phase I of the study followed a classic 3+3 design. The dose of DAC was fixed: 15 mg/m2 iv daily for 10 days. This was based on a previous phase I study ( Blood  2004 ; 103 : 1635 ) that indicated that this schedule had an optimal toxicity-response profile in this population. Three dose levels of VPA were selected: 20, 35 and 50 mg/kg. VPA was given orally for 10 days concomitantly with DAC. 22 pts have completed the phase I portion of the study (median age 56 years, range 4\u201378, 20 pts AML, 2 MDS). At dose level 1 (20 mg/kg of VPA) no grade III-IV toxicity was observed. At dose level 2 (VPA 35 mg/kg), 2 out 6 pts developed grade III neurotoxicity. Both pts were receiving high doses of other neurotropic agents. After IRB approval, 3 mores pts were treated at this dose level with no significant toxicity. Subsequently, 3 pts were treated at the highest planned dose level (50 mg/kg) with no toxicity observed. This cohort was then expanded to a total of 10 pts. One pt developed grade III neurotoxicity. No other severe drug-related toxicities were observed, but 5 patients at all dose levels developed grade II sedation/somnolence. Pancytopenia was induced in all pts. At dose level 1, one pt with refractory AML achieved complete remission (CR) after the second course of therapy. This is now maintained for 5 courses. At dose level 2, a patient with HIV disease and relapsed AML achieved CR after the third course of therapy, and 2 pts with relapsed AML achieved complete marrow responses (marrow blasts less then 5%, no recovery of peripheral counts). Of 3 pts evaluable for response at dose level 3, 1 pt with MDS has achieved CR after 1 course, and 1 with relapsed AML a complete marrow response. Median free VPA levels pretreatment were 0, and 25 mg/L on both days 5 and 10 and returned to 0 prior to next course. Histone acetylation measured by Western blot was observed in 3 pts (25%), all at doses above 20 mg/kg of VPA. Reactivation of p21 expression was induced in 4 out 11 pts analyzed. Global hypomethylation measured using a bisulfite PCR LINE assay was induced in 1 out 3 pts so far studied. Based on the toxicity observed, the phase II portion of the study was initiated. This is restricted to pts with AML/MDS. Seven pts have been accrued to this phase, and 8 out the 10 pts at dose level 3 of the phase I are also evaluable. The response data of this pts will be updated at the meeting. In summary, the combination of low dose DAC and VPA up to doses of 50 mg/kg can be safely administered to pts with leukemia although it may be complicated by neurotoxicity. Clinical and biological activity was observed at all dose levels.",
