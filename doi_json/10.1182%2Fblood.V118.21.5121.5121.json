    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5121 Multiple myeloma refractory to bortezomib, IMiDs\u2122, and conventional therapies represents an unmet medical need. An increasing number of patients progress to this stage since treatment related mortality has decreased. To test promising compounds for activity in this setting we established an NSG mouse xenograft model with serial transplantation by tail vein injection of myeloma cells from a patient with IgG kappa myeloma relapsed and refractory to all standard drugs. Eight days after tail vein injection monoclonal human IgG can be detected in serum. Bone marrow engraftment in young (6\u201312 weeks) NSG mice after sublethal radiation (275cGy) is close to 100% (n=32). Untreated mice die within less than 2 months, usually with liver and spleen metastasis (anti-human CD138 flow cytometry). In a drug screen that used a novel method developed in our lab, chromatin condensation PCR, we identified a non nucleoside compound (4I3) that potently (1mM) reactivated expression of epigenetically silenced genes and displayed cancer-specific growth and survival inhibition in myeloma cell lines but not normal cells. Normal bone marrow cells continued to divide at doses 10x higher than required to kill 80% of myeloma cells. 4I3 suppressed DNMT1 protein but rapid cell kill (within 1\u20132 days) suggested additional mechanisms which we currently investigate. Given IV to mice after documentation of engraftment by IgG serum immunoblots, it prolonged survival in an ongoing experiment. Updated results will be presented at the meeting.
