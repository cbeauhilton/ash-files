    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Constant clonal evolution and outgrowth of clones that harbor resistance mutations are likely explanations for the emergence of drug-resistant disease in multiple myeloma (MM). Activating mutations in BRAF , KRAS and NRAS have been suggested as potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we investigate resistance to BRAF inhibition in the context of BRAF -mutated MM which accounts for about 5-12% of all patients with relapsed/ refractory MM. Methods: Resistance to dabrafenib was modeled in vitro in the BRAF -mutated MM cell lines (MMCL) U266 ( K601N mut ) and DP6 ( BRAFV600E mut ). Low-pass whole genome sequencing (LPWGS), RNA sequencing, ChIP sequencing and immunoblotting were performed for genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and molecular characterization. Functional validation was performed by genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Results: Modeling of dabrafenib resistance in vitro revealed an initial decline of cell numbers, followed by a plateau phase and a gradual outgrowth of resistant cells after ~80 days of treatment. As expected, exposure of BRAF mut MMCL to dabrafenib led to initial downregulation of pERK and pMEK. At later timepoints, upregulation of pERK and pMEK was observed, suggesting that re-activation of the ERK/MEK pathway ultimately overcomes BRAF inhibition. This outgrowth was associated with highly distinct copy number profiles in each resistant clone, implying clonal selection with outgrowth of genetically resistant clones as one mechanism of drug resistance in MM. Additionally, we found that BRAF inhibition of BRAF mut MMCL promotes changes of the transcriptional circuitry that appears independent of clonal outgrowth of genetically resistant clones. These transcriptional changes were highly homogenous, occurred as early as 7-14 days after starting treatment and were associated with de-differentiation of MMCL into a more immature B lymphocytic phenotype. This phenotype was associated with greater mRNA expression of CD19 and CD81 , as well as upregulation of the B-lymphocyte activation antigen B7-2 (CD86) and PI3K pathway genes. We next investigated if targeting the PI3K pathway and B7.2 can be exploited for effective killing of dabrafenib-resistant BRAF mut MM cells. Studies for the PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor idelalisib in dabrafenib-persistent MMCL revealed higher sensitivity as compared to dabrafenib-na\u00efve controls. Genome editing suggests a survival advantage for CD86 WT as compared to CD86 KO MMCL. Conclusions: Our data suggest that resistance to BRAF inhibition in vitro is mediated by two distinct mechanisms: 1) clonal outgrowth of genetically distinct resistant clones, and 2) transcriptional rewiring that leads to activation of alternative signaling pathways. The latter is characterized by changes in cellular differentiation and upregulation of PI3K and CD28/CD86 signaling. These concepts may provide a framework for revealing therapeutic vulnerabilities and to overcome drug resistance mediated by genetic heterogeneity in MM.
