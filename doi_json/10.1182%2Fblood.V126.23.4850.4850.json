    "abstract_text": "The survival rate for infants is less than 50%. The fast majority of infant acute leukemias are characterized cytogenetically by balanced chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene. Leukemic therapies that degrade the driver oncogene are associated with loss of cancer cell self-renewal and excellent cure rates. Therefore, therapy that degrades the MLL fusion gene would offer new hope to these patients. Recently it was shown that the Drosophila Trithorax gene, an analogue of the human MLL, is degraded by Radicicol. Radicicol is a natural compound and a well-known Hsp90 inhibitor. Here, we show that Radicicol is able to induce a dose dependent degradation of the MLL-fusion protein in a panel of human MLL rearranged cell lines and in human cord blood-derived MLL-AF9 immortalised myeloid cells. This drug induced degradation of the MLL-fusion gene results in down-regulation of the expression of MLL target genes, including HOXA9, MEIS1 and c-MYB. Functionally, this results in a loss of self-renewal of the leukemic stem cells, as shown by methylcellulose colony forming assays. Radicicol proved ineffective and too toxic for in vivo use. One of the best tolerated Hsp90 inhibitors is Ganetespib. It is currently in phase II/III clinical trials. We extended our Radicicol data to Ganetespib. Like Radicicol, Ganetespib induces MLL-fusion protein degradation and downregulation of MLL target genes. Treatment of MLL rearranged leukemia with Ganetespib results in a loss of leukemic stem cell activity. In conclusion, we show how the inactivation of the MLL-fusion and down-regulation of MLL target genes results in a block of leukemic stem cell self- renewal. We will validate these findings in a pre-clinical in vivo model in the near future. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
