    "abstract_text": "Adoptive cell transfers of receptor gene-engineered T cells include chimeric antigen receptor-gene transduced T (CAR-T) cell therapy and TCR-gene transduced T (TCR-T) cell therapy. In CD19-CAR-T cell therapy, high incidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is associated with in vivo CAR-T cell proliferation and its clinical efficacy. In human TCR-T cell therapies, there have not been well known about CRS and its association with in vivo T cell kinetics or tumor responses. We have been developing a novel-type affinity-enhanced NY-ESO-1-specific TCR, and an original retrovirus vector that encodes siRNA to silence endogenous TCR creation. The NY-ESO-1 TCR is mutated for high affinity with replacements of G50A and A51E in CDR2 region, which is restricted with HLA-A*02:01 and A*02:06. We extensively examined potential cross-reactivities to different antigen-peptides in preclinical studies, and the high-affinity NY-ESO-1 TCR did not recognize analogous peptides. The new generation retroviral TCR-vector provides enhanced expression of transduced tumor-specific TCRs and an inhibition effect of formations of self-reactive TCRs. This is a first-in-man clinical trial of the novel NY-ESO-1-specfic TCR-T cell transfer to evaluate the safety, in vivo cell kinetics and clinical responses. It is designed as a cell-dose escalation from 5 x10 8 to 5 x10 9 cells. NY-ESO-1-expressing refractory cancer patients were enrolled, with 3+3 cohort design. Cyclophosphamide with/without fludarabine were administered prior to the TCR-T cell transfer as pre-conditioning. Six patients were treated with the NY-ESO-1 TCR-T cell transfer, and evaluated for the safety and in vivo cell kinetics. The TCR-T cells appeared in peripheral blood with a dose-dependent manner, associated with in vivo proliferation in an early phase. In three patients given 5x10 8 cells, no toxicities were seen. Two patients receiving 5x10 9 cells developed early-phase CRS (G2), with elevations of serum IL-6 and IFN-gamma. They were managed the treatment of anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, tocilizumab. In a patient who developed CRS, an event of lung injury (G3) occurred, which was associated with marked infiltration of the NY-ESO-1 TCR-T cells. It was successfully treated with steroid. Two synovial sarcoma patients exhibited tumor responses of PRs. In one patient, progression-free survival lasted more than 8 months. In summary, the affinity-enhanced NY-ESO-1 TCR-T cell transfer exhibited CRSs in association with in vivo cell proliferation and sequential tumor responses.
