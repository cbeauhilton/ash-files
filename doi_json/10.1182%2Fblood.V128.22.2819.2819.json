    "abstract_text": "MERTK is a receptor tyrosine kinase of the TAM family (TYRO-3, AXL, MERTK) that is ectopically expressed in 30-50% of newly diagnosed pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient samples and aberrantly expressed in 80-100% of pediatric and adult primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. MERTK inhibition mediated by shRNA or a small molecule inhibitor, MRX-2843, decreased colony-forming potential and induced apoptosis in leukemia cell cultures. Moreover, MERTK inhibition prolonged survival in mouse xenograft models of acute leukemia, but was not curative. In these models, treatment with MRX-2843 effectively reduced peripheral disease burden but was less effective in the bone marrow, suggesting a role for the bone marrow microenvironment in therapeutic resistance. Additionally, Gas6, a MERTK ligand, is a poor prognostic factor in AML, mediates increased resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy in leukemia cells, and is expressed in the bone marrow. To determine the role of Gas6 produced by bone marrow stromal cells in mediating resistance to MERTK inhibition by MRX-2843, acute leukemia cell lines were cultured in the presence of a Gas6-producing fibroblast-like cell line (HS27) or bone marrow derived stromal cells (BMDSCs) from wild type or Gas6 knockout mice and induction of apoptosis and cell death was determined by flow cytometry after treatment with MRX-2843 or vehicle. Co-culture with the HS27 cell line significantly reduced cell death in Kasumi-1 AML cell cultures in response to treatment with 300nM MRX-2843 compared to leukemia cells alone (29.4% versus 60.5%, p=0.002). Similar results were observed in Nomo1 AML and 697 pre-B ALL cell cultures. To evaluate whether soluble factors mediated this protective effect, Kasumi-1 cells were cultured in HS27-conditioned medium in the presence or absence of MRX-2843. Interestingly, conditioned medium was not sufficient to provide protection from MRX-2843 induced apoptosis (86.0% vs. 85.5% in unconditioned medium). To more directly assess the role of Gas6, BMDSCs isolated from wild-type and Gas6 knockout C57Bl/6 mice were co-cultured with 697 leukemia cells and sensitivity to MRX-2843 was determined. BMDSCs from wild-type mice protected 697 leukemia cells from MRX-2843 induced cell death much more effectively than BMDSCs from Gas6 knockout mice (4.3% apoptotic and dead cells versus 72.4%, respectively). To investigate biochemical mechanisms of Gas6-mediated protection, Kasumi-1 AML cells were cultured with 200nM MRX-2843 or vehicle in the presence or absence of HS27 cells and expression and activation of MERTK, AXL, TYRO-3, and downstream signaling effectors STAT5, AKT, and ERK1/2 were determined by immunoblot. AXL was not expressed in Kasumi-1 cells with or without co-culture. Treatment with MRX-2843 mediated robust inhibition of MERTK activation indicated by reduced levels of phosphorylated protein in both the presence and absence of stromal cell co-culture. In contrast, activation of TYRO-3 was increased after treatment with MRX-2843 in leukemia cells co-cultured with HS27 stromal cells. Similarly, in the absence of co-culture MRX-2843 inhibited activation of STAT5, AKT, and ERK1/2. However, in the presence of HS27 cells there was robust activation of STAT5 that was sustained even after treatment with MRX-2843. In contrast, MRX-2843 inhibited activation of AKT and ERK1/2 in HS27 co-cultures, although higher doses were required. Together these data support a model whereby Gas6 produced by stromal cells mediates leukemia cell resistance to MERTK inhibition in the bone marrow by inducing activation of TYRO-3, thereby promoting downstream signaling and cell survival despite MERTK inhibition. Thus, combined treatment with MRX-2843 and a TAM ligand sink (eg MERTK-Fc), a TYRO-3 inhibitor, or a bone marrow mobilizing agent may be particularly effective therapeutic strategies.
