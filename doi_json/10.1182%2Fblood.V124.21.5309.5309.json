    "abstract_text": "Background: Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) can be viewed as newly formed, abnormal hemopoeitic tissue initiated by few leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Recognizing the LSC and identifying their behavior, plays a pivotal role in the approach of a targeted therapy.Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), also known as M-CSF, is a protein ligand that acts on the CSF1R promotes mononuclear phagocytes survival, proliferation and differentiation. Aim of the work: Defining the self-renewing [Thy1-, CD34+, CD38-] LICs in AML cases before and after induction chemotherapy as a predictor for relapse and to determine how CSF1R (Fms) and CD34 markers affect the growth and survival of human leukemic cells in the CD38- Thy1- population. Patients and methods: This study was carried out on 30 samples from the peripheral blood of adult patients with de-novo acute myeloid leukemia. The majority of the patients were monocytic AML Samples were sorted into four populations (Fms+CD34-, Fms+CD34+, Fms-CD34+ and Fms-CD34-) according to the surface markers of the cells. Cells were cultured on mouse stromal cells transfected with a plasmid containing human CSF-1. Samples were cultured using Iscove's modified Dulbecc's medium (IMDM).The cultures were assessed for survival of leukemic cells in days. Results: The mean survival in days of the cells was 13.9 before chemotherapy and 14.1 after chemotherapy. The difference in growth was insignificant (p>0.05). The Fms-CD34+ population in all but two samples tested had the longest survival time in culture. Conclusion: Our results suggest that leukemic stem cells may survive chemotherapy mainly due to their quiescence. Human CSF-1 was shown to increase the number of leukemic cells in co-culture with mouse stroma after 5 weeks. A novel leukemic stem cell (Fms-CD34+) has been identified and is the cell responsible for the growth and maintenance of the leukemic bulk. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
