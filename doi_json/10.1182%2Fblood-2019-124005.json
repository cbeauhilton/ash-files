    "abstract_text": "Recurrent mutations in the ER chaperone calreticulin (CALR) are found in ~30% of MPNs. All known CALR mutations result in a +1-frameshift of the CALR reading frame that retains the N-domain and P-arm of wild-type CALR and generates a novel mutant-specific C-terminal domain encoded by an alternative reading frame. Multiple groups have previously demonstrated that mutant CALR (CALR MUT ) physically binds to and activates the thrombopoietin receptor MPL and causes inappropriate receptor activation and downstream JAK-STAT signaling in a ligand-independent manner. These oncogenic activities of CALR MUT have been shown to be dependent on a threshold of basic amino acid residues in the mutant-specific C-terminus and on the lectin motif within the N-domain. In this study, we extended the analysis of the role of the N-domain in CALR MUT activity by performing a comprehensive alanine mutagenesis screen of all 177 non-alanine residues within the N-domain and assessed the ability of alanine-mutants to confer cytokine independent growth in Ba/F3-MPL cells. We identified two functional groups of residues as being important for CALR MUT activity: (i) Residues associated with CALR lectin motif. Consistent with previous work which had shown that Asp135 and Asp317 was essential for CALR MUT activity, we observed that loss of any of 4 residues within the lectin motif (Cys105, Lys111, Gly133 and Asp135) led to total impairment in the ability of CALR MUT to confer cytokine independence, bind MPL or elicit JAK-STAT signaling. Surprisingly, other residues implicated in lectin activity (Tyr109, Tyr128, Met131) had either only a partial effect or no effect on CALR MUT oncogenic activity, suggesting that different regions within the lectin motif of CALR have differential effects in facilitating MPL binding. (ii) Residues associated with zinc binding. We also identified a group of zinc-binding histidine residues (His99, His145 and His170) as being important for modulating CALR MUT activity. We observed that loss of any single histidine residue (1xHis) led to partial abrogation of cytokine independence in Ba/F3-MPL cells. Strikingly, combined loss of two (or more) histidines (2xHis) led to complete impairment in the capacity to confer cytokine independent growth or elicit JAK-STAT signaling, in conjunction with impaired ability to physically associate with Zn 2+ by affinity chromatography. In addition, 2xHis-CALR MUT failed to bind MPL in pulldown assays or colocalize with MPL in FRET-based immunocytochemical analysis. We next investigated in greater detail how the zinc binding capacity of CALR MUT regulates its oncogenic activity. Previous studies have shown that CALR MUT forms homomultimers (Araki, Leukemia, 33:122), and that zinc is able to increase homomultimerization of recombinant wild-type CALR in vitro (Li, Biochemistry, 40:11193). We therefore tested the multimerization capacity of lectin-deficient or zinc binding-deficient CALR MUT by assessing the ability of heterologously-expressed FLAG-tagged CALR MUT species to complex and co-immunoprecipitate with a V5-tagged CALR MUT species in 293T cells. We observed that lectin-deficient CALR MUT and 1xHis-CALR MUT retained the capacity to form homomultimers, but the 2xHis- CALR MUT could not, suggesting that zinc binding was required for homomultimer formation. Treatment with ZnCl 2 which increases free intracellular Zn 2+ resulted in increased CALR MUT homomultimerization in a dose-dependent manner, as well as increased binding to MPL within heteromeric complexes. Finally, treatment with the zinc chelator TPEN led to decreased CALR MUT homomultimer formation, decreased CALR MUT -MPL heteromultimeric complexes and attenuated JAK-STAT signaling. Cumulatively, our data suggest that zinc is required for homomultimerization of CALR MUT , and is a necessary prerequisite event to facilitate binding to and activation of MPL in CALR-mutated MPNs.
