    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3456 Megakaryocytes (MKs) are rare cells that generate about 10 10 platelets every day, which are necessary for vascular homeostasis via clot formation and contraction. Understanding MK differentiation and platelet production is of broad clinical importance and extends to a need to augment platelet numbers in patients. Our group has demonstrated that reversible but sustained inhibition of non-muscle myosin-II (NMM-II) increases MK polyploidization, proplatelet formation, and membrane flexibility, thereby increasing platelet generation (Shin, Spinler, et al., PNAS, 2011; 108:11458\u201363). The terminal steps of hematopoiesis involve the coordinated maturation and migration of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the bone marrow to the perivascular niche. Bulky, polyploid MKs do not easily transmigrate into blood, but do extend tubular membrane \u2018proplatelet\u2019 projections into the bloodstream. Visualization by others has shown that blood shear stress fragments the projections into circulating platelets, motivating a controlled study of shear effects on MKs in vitro . To recapitulate this environment in vitro , a cone and plate rheometer is used to impart physiologically relevant shear stress on MEG01s, a human MK cell line. These experiments reveal that platelet-like-particle (PLP) generation is sensitive to both biomechanical and pharmacological factors namely blebbistatin inhibition of NMM-II. We demonstrate that shear stress reduces phosphor-deactivation of NMM-II heavy chain at Ser1943 to approximately 30% of the unsheared level, which indicates a restoration of NMM-II activity necessary for proper platelet function. Stimulation of rheometer generated PLP cultures with collagen-I showed aggregation and phosphatidylserine exposure (with Annexin-V binding in the presence of Ca 2+ ). These data demonstrates that PLPs generated in this system retain some degree of functionality such that MKs exposed to shear stress and blebbistatin result in approximately 6.5 fold more PLPs than untreated MK cultures. Other groups have shown the transport and assembly of platelet organelles to be microtubule dependent and occur de novo along proplatelets (Italiano, et al, Blood, 2005; 106:4066\u201375). To assess partitioning and segregation of proteins from MKs in sheared membranes, we used fluorescence-imaged micro-deformation (FIMD) to monitor CD41 and NMM-IIA during micropipette aspiration. Studies of erythrocytes had already shown a rich variety of membrane component responses to membrane distension (Discher, et al, Science, 1994; 266:1032\u20135), but the methods have not yet been applied to MKs. Antibody labeling of MK surface CD41 shows a homogeneous intensity along the aspirated projection of membrane, but cell body shows approximately 3 fold higher intensity, suggesting an excess of CD41 in the MK. Pre-treatment with blebbistatin increases fragmentation frequency, and these fragments show a similar trend with CD41 expression. Nucleofection was used to introduce either GFP tagged WT NMM-IIA or phosphomemetic, myosin deactivating, GFP tagged NMM-IIA S1943D to assess whether pSer impacts partitioning of this cytoskeletal protein that is abundant in platelets. Both WT and S1943D NMM-IIA are seen in the aspirated cell projection, but WT NMM-IIA clearly accumulates at the leading edge of the aspirated projection and at sites of membrane fission and fragmentation, whereas S1943D remains uniformly dispersed. These findings thus underscore the central role that NMM-II heavy chain phosphorylation, and thus activity, in proplatelet formation and platelet fragmentation.
