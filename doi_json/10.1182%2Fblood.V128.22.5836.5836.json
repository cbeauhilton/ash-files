    "abstract_text": "Objective : To evaluate the efficacy and long-term outcome of the total treatment of induction therapy, ASCT and consolidation and maintenance therapy. Methods: A retrospective analysis was made on in multiple myeloma patients in our center between April 1, 2003 and February 1, 2016. The 157 patietns received autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and review the autologous transplantation of long-term follow-up results. Analysis of the effect of transplantation efficacy, the impact on survival remission of different transplantation depth, transplantation in first line or not, salvage transplantation, prognosis of different staging system and other factors. Results: The baseline characteristics of the patients were shown in table 1. Overall patient ASCT before total effective rate (ORR) was 93.6%, in which the complete remission (CR) ratio was 33.1%. After ASCT, the best treatment response rate of PR was 80.3%, and the rate of CR was 58.6%. 91.69 months of median follow-up, patients with an overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) respectively 91.69 and 50.76 months; in 2005 before the median OS and PFS 39.0m and 23.0m. In 2005 after respectively and 56.41m 120.90m, P = 0.000. The median OS and PFS in the first line transplantation group and salvage transplantation group were vs 54.21m 39.0m and vs 7.09m 119.0m (P value was 0). 136 cases of patients with R-ISS stage, I, II, III of the patients with the median survival time were 120.90m (n=46), 86.43m (n=69), 35.65m (n=21), there were significant differences between groups, p=0.000. Each period of PFS were 72.11m, 51.84m, 28.09m, I and II, III,, p=0.001 and p=0.03, while there was no significant difference between II and III, p=0.122. The received autologous transplantation as first-line and salvage treatment of patients with subgroup survival analysis, median OS of the R-ISS stage III patients and different 15.84m 35.65m, P = 0.031; two groups of patients the median PFS (phase I: 91.69m vs18.92m; II: vs 16.69m 53.42m; phase III: vs 5.91m 28.52m) have difference (P = 0.000). In the first-line transplantation group, transplantation is more than or equal to PR and did not get effective PR group between OS were significantly different; before transplantation achieved CR, PR but did not obtain Cr and did not get effective PR group between PFS were significantly different; after transplantation and achieved CR CR did not get the patients had a median PFS were 65.57m 48.13m, P = 0.039 and median OS no difference. Accept any kind of noval agent- based chemotherapy were significantly longer OS and PFS than traditional chemotherapy (P = 0.001, P = 0.004) .There was no obvious difference on median OS between based regimen (bortezomib group median OS: NR; thalidomide group:120.90m); PFS in thalidomide group (median PFS : NR vs 54.21m) significantly prolonged (P = 0.010). By comparing the baseline characteristics of the two groups, it was found that the PFS was significantly shorter in the bortezomib group with an extra medullary lesion. Multivariate analysis showed that only R-ISS and the depth of remission before transplantation had effect on OS (p=0.003) and PFS (p=0.036) respectively. Conclusion: The total treatment of novel agent-based chemotherapy and ASCT for transplantation-eligible multiple myeloma patients is effective, further improve the remission rate and remission depth, prolong PFS and OS, the overall median survival up to 120.9m. First line transplantation can significantly prolong the OS and PFS compared with salvage transplantation. R-ISS and pre-transplant remission depth are prognostic factors influencing survival of patients. The total treatment to thalidomide based without extramedullary perhaps makes patients get long-term survival. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
