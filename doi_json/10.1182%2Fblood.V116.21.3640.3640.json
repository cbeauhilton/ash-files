    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3640 Background & Aims: The hypothesis that cancer is driven by Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs or Cancer-Initiating Cell) has recently attracted a great deal of attention. Epigenetic mechanism such as DNA methylation and histone modification play an important role in cancer cells and also in normal stem cells. However, their role remains unclear in CSCs. We sought to determine if CSCs have distinct epigenetic patterns in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods: Peripheral blood samples in AML patients were separated to obtain stem cells (CD34+CD38-) and progenitor cells (CD34+CD38+) by magnetic cell sorting (MACS\u00ae, Myltenyi biotec). To study DNA methylation in CSCs in AML, we performed genome wide screening using methylated CpG island microarray (MCAM), which detects 7202 promoter CpG islands, 1348 non-promoter CpG islands, and 632 non-CpG island promoter methylation. MCAM was performed on 4 AML patient samples Next, we evaluated the methylation status of 7 genes which showed apparent higher DNA methylation in stem cells or progenitor cells in MCAM analysis, using a quantitative bisulfite-pyrosequencing for each population of stem cell, progenitor cell, and mature cells (CD34-) from peripheral blood samples in 6 AML patients. For histone modification analysis, we used Chromation immuprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) for stem cell and progenitor cell populations for H3K4me3 which is known to be a marker for activated genes. Results: By MCAM, we found minimal differences between stem cells and progenitor cells present in 2 out of 4 AML patients. Those few genes (<1%) which were shown to have higher DNA methylation in stem or progenitor cells by MCAM analysis were likely false positives, as no significant difference was found when analyzed by quantitative bisulfite-pyrosequencing. DNA methylation status for stem cell-related gene (OCT4, SOX2, MYC, HOXB4, and KLF4) also showed no significant difference. By ChIP-seq analysis, we found differences in 2362 genes between stem cells and progenitor cells. In stem cells, H3K4me3 was enriched in genes (Bmi1, Notch1, Wnt1, and etc) which are known to be important for stem cell function, but they were not enriched in the progenitor cell population. In pathway analysis of the H3K4me3 data, Hypoxia-Inducible Factor signaling, NFkB signaling, and p53 signaling are found to be enriched specifically in the stem cell population whereas Cellular Growth and Cell Cycle, and DNA Damage Response signaling are found in the progenitor cell population. Conclusions: There is no significant difference in DNA methylation between stem cell, progenitor cell or mature cell populations in AML. DNA methylation of promoter CpG islands is unlikely to explain tumor hierarchy in AML. Rather, histone modifications seem to have a greater significance in this regard.
