    "abstract_text": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the clonal amplification of CD5-expressing B cells that appear to develop and evolve based on signals from the microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) may be keys to this stimulation. Because clonal turnover can lead to the release of naked nuclear material into the cellular microenvironment, these remnants of dying/dead cells may contribute to disease progression by repeated low level T-independent activation of CLL cells through the combination of the BCR and TLRs. To test this hypothesis, we assessed TLR9-driven or BCR + TLR9-driven CLL B-cell activation, focusing on its impact on telomerase activation in CLL cells, which is known to be important in the disease and which we have shown to be selectively activated by BCR stimulation in Ig V -unmutated (U-CLL) clones but not in Ig V -mutated (M-CLL) clones. B cells, isolated by negative selection from peripheral blood of IgM + CLL patients and cryopreserved until use, were cultured for 16 hr without/ with TLR9 agonist, ODN 2006, alone and were assayed for apoptosis using Annexin V and flow cytometry. To study the relative contribution of simultaneous TLR9 activation and BCR activation, B cells were exposed to ODN2006 alone or HB57dex (monoclonal anti IgM Ab conjugated onto dextran) alone or a combination of the two reagents. Extracts from cells cultured for a period of 3 days were assayed for functional telomerase activity using TRAP. Parallel cultures of B cells exposed to the same stimuli were harvested at day 3 and assayed for cell activation and proliferation, which was assessed by 3 H thymidine incorporation. CLL cells cultured with ODN2006 exhibited significant apoptosis within 16 hours in 6/12 cases. However at day 3, the same stimulus elicited significant increases in percentages of CD69-expressing cells and densities of HLA-DR in all CLL cases studied. As compared to BCR activation, which upregulates telomerase activity in U-CLL only, TLR9-mediated activation of CLL induced telomerase activation in all CLL cases. Furthermore, ODN2006 elicited significantly higher induction of telomerase activity in M-CLL cases compared to U-CLL cases (p=0.01). In addition, in M-CLL cases, simultaneous activation via TLR9 and BCR significantly upregulated the telomerase activity (p=0.05) that was induced by TLR9 activation alone. IRAK-1/4 inhibitor down modulated both TLR9 mediated and TLR9 +BCR mediated telomerase activity to a greater extent in M-CLL cases than in U-CLL cases. TLR9 activation of CLL cells induced a 3.75 + 0.8 fold (range 1.1 to 19.6; n=32) increase in cell proliferation. When segregated by Ig V mutation, U-CLL cells (n=16) responded significantly better (6.0 + 1.6 fold) compared to M-CLL cells (2.1 + 0.3 fold, n=16; p=0.03). However, co-stimulation of cells via their BCR significantly increased TLR-mediated responses only in M-CLL cases (from 2.3 + 0.4 fold to 5.4 + 1.7 fold; p=0.05). IRAK-1/4 inhibitor did not exert a significant effect on TLR9 mediated cell proliferation in either the U-CLL or M-CLL cases. Co-culture of CLL cells with human stromal cells, HS5, further upregulated the concerted TLR9 + BCR induced proliferative responses in 70% of the cases studied. Together, these results indicate that simultaneous stimulation of CLL cells via both their TLR9 and BCR molecules positively impacts on telomerase activity in all patients studied. Since telomerase is crucial in maintaining longevity of repeatedly stimulated cells, this could represent a mechanism for worse clinical outcome in CLL. These studies stress the need for devising therapeutic agents or combinations thereof to effectively target multiple pathways downstream of these signaling receptors and to ultimately eradicate newly evolving CLL cells.
