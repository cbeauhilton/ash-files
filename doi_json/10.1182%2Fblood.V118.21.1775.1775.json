    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1775 Promising clinical responses have been observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients treated with lenalidomide as a single agent or in combination with other agents, The mechanisms of action of lenalidomide are under study; unlike most other anti-leukemia drugs, lenalidomide has no direct cytoxic effects in vitro on primary CLL cells, which typically are in G0/1 phase of the cell cycle. We examined the activity of lenalidomide on CLL cells that were induced to proliferate in vitro . To induce proliferation, CLL cells were cultured in media containing human interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 and with stromal cells (HeLa) made to express CD154. Labeling CLL cells with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), allowed us to monitor for several rounds of induced CLL-cell division via flow cytometry. We found that addition of 0.33\u201310 micro M lenalidomide to such cultures resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the number of leukemia cells induced to undergo cell-division. Moreover, we found that lenalidomide could significantly reduce the number of dividing CLL cells in each patient sample tested (n=4) by an average of 1.7 fold, reducing the fraction of dividing cells from 77% \u00b1 27% to 44% \u00b1 22% after 6 days of culture (mean +/\u2212 SD, P < 0.05). Evaluation of the DNA content of CLL cells using propidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry revealed that lenalidomide significantly decreased the percentage of CLL cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle from 9% \u00b1 2.7% to 5.1% \u00b1 2.1% (mean +/\u2212 SD, n=4; P< 0.05) in control versus lenalidomide-treated cultures, respectively. Furthermore, lenalidomide appeared also to reduce the percentages of CLL cells in S phase from 12% \u00b1 8% to 6.2% \u00b1 3.1%. We found that the capacity of lenalidomide to inhibit CLL cell-division was associated with lenalidomide-induced leukemia-cell expression of p21/WAF/Cip, which can directly inhibit the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases required for progression from G1 into the S phase of the cell cycle. Gene expression analysis of CLL cells (n=10) revealed that lenalidomide induced increased leukemia-cell expression of p21/WAF/Cip at 6h and at 24h, an effect that also was noted for leukemia cells in the blood of patients treated with single-agent lenalidomide. Lenalidomide-induced expression of p21/WAF/Cip was associated with induced expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, a downstream target of of p21/WAF/Cip. However, lenalidomide did not appear to induce leukemia-cell expression of TP53 , which can induce p21/WAF/Cip, suggesting that lenalidomide induces p21/WAF/Cip via a TP53 -independent mechanism. These results suggest that lenalidomide has effects on CLL cells that are distinct from those induced by CD40-ligation. Moreover, these studies reveal a potential mechanism for the anti-leukemia activity of lenalidomide, which might inhibit factors that potentially drive leukemia-cell proliferation in vivo .
