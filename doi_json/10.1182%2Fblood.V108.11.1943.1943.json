    "abstract_text": "Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, is involved in both, inhibition of apoptosis and regulation of cell division. It is expressed in embryonic and fetal tissues as well as in the majority of human leukemias, but is undetectable in normal differentiated adult tissue in vivo. The molecular mechanisms involved in the cancer-specific re-expression of survivin are unclear. In this study, we describe a novel mechanism for over-expression of survivin in AML. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), we show that the early growth response (Egr)-1 transcription factor binds to the sequence 5\u2032 GAGGGGGCG 3\u2032 within the human survivin promoter after induction by phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) in vitro. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis confirmed the specific binding of Egr-1 to the proximal survivin promoter in PMA treated entire leukemia cells. To further analyze the functionality of the Egr-1 site within the survivin promoter in entire cells, transient transfections of p53 wildtype and mutated cell lines with wildtype Egr-1 expression vector were performed. In these overexpression experiments, mRNA and protein levels of survivin but not of control protein were downregulated after exogenous expression of wildtype Egr-1. Using reporter-gene assays, basal survivin promoter activity was decreased significantly by wildtype Egr-1 transfection, whereas mutant Egr-1 did not change activity of the survivin promoter, implying that Egr-1 specifically blocks survivin expression at the transcriptional level. In addition, Egr-1 over-expression sensitized cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. To investigate the expression pattern of Egr-1 in different AML cell lines and control samples from healthy donors, we analyzed the expression of Egr-1 by RT-PCR. Fitting with the above shown data, Egr-1 was expressed at significantly lower levels in AML cell lines expressing high survivin levels than in healthy control samples with low survivin levels. Taken together, we show that the transcription factor Egr-1 binds to the human survivin promoter in vitro and in entire cells, downregulates survivin expression independently of p53 and sensitizes cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Since Survivin is often overexpressed in AML, downregulating Survivin expression by activating Egr-1 may be an interesting therapeutic option."
