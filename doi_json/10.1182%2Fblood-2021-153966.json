    "abstract_text": "Background Outcomes of COVID-19 infection among children with underlying malignancy remain unclear, with limited data available to date. Here we report clinical characteristics and outcomes following COVID-19 infection among children with underlying malignancy or a history of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) during the first year of the global COVID-19 pandemic, in Dallas, TX. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed children with a history of malignancy or prior HSCT and positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result between March 1, 2020 - March 31, 2021. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were reviewed, and analyzed according to underlying condition and disease severity. Results: Forty-six patients with underlying malignancy or HSCT met inclusion criteria. Median age was 9 years, with twenty (43%) female, and twenty-seven (59%) of Hispanic ethnicity. Underlying conditions included Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (67%), Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (9%), HSCT (11%), sarcoma (9%), solid tumors (9%), and Hodgkin's lymphoma (2%). Fifteen subjects (33%) were asymptomatic, with twenty-four children (52%) classified as having mild, five (11%) with severe, and two (4%) with critical COVID-19 disease. The most common symptoms at presentation were fever (46%), cough (39%), and gastroenteritis (19%). Thirty-four children (74%) were hospitalized, with seven (15%) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care. 17% of patients were admitted for treatment of COVID-19 alone, with other indications including neutropenic fever, relapse, and chemotherapy. Six (13%) patients required non-invasive ventilation, and two patients (4%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Median length of stay was 9 days (IQR 4.5-24.5), with median ICU stay of 3.5 days (IQR 2-26.7). Seven children (15%) received COVID-19 targeted therapy including steroids, remdesivir or convalescent plasma. Among severe and critically ill children, six (86%) had underlying hematologic malignancies (5 HR ALL, 1 AML), and two (28%) a prior history of HSCT. Two children (4%) died. Thirty-six patients (78%) achieved documented clearance of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, at median of 43.5 days (IQR 28.7-65.2). Conclusion: Among children with underlying malignancy or a history of HSCT, COVID-19 results in a spectrum of illness ranging from asymptomatic disease to death. Rates of hospitalization are high compared to the general pediatric population, and illness may be complicated by additional factors including co-infection, neutropenic fever, relapse of malignancy and need for chemotherapy. Children with hematologic malignancy or a history of HSCT may be at increased risk for severe disease. Additional studies are urgently needed to elucidate risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19 disease among children with underlying malignancy.
