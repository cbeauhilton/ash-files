    "abstract_text": "Background: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive type of non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and accounts for 6% of all NHL cases in Western countries (Thandra KC. Med Sci. 2021;9:5). First-line treatment options are not curative and most patients (pts) experience relapse (Wu H. Front Oncol. 2020:10:588314; Kumar A. Blood Cancer J . 2019;9:50). Targeted therapies, including Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, are used as second- and later-lines; however, treatment intolerance and failure are common with poor survival outcomes (Epperla N. Hematol Oncol. 2017;35:528-35; Jain P. Br J Haematol. 2018;182:404-11). Thus, novel therapies are needed for pts with relapsed or refractory (R/R) MCL. Parsaclisib is a potent, highly selective, next-generation inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) \u03b4. Here, we report results of the primary analysis of the cohort of BTK inhibitor-naive pts with R/R MCL treated with parsaclisib monotherapy in the open-label, phase 2 study CITADEL-205 (NCT03235544, EudraCT 2017-003148-19). Methods: Eligible pts were \u226518 years old, had pathologically confirmed MCL with documented cyclin D1 overexpression or t(11;14) translocation, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) \u22642. Pts must have received 1-3 prior systemic therapies and not had any prior treatment with a BTK and/or PI3K inhibitor. Pts were allocated to receive parsaclisib 20 mg once daily (QD) for 8 weeks followed by either 20 mg once weekly (weekly-dosing group [WG]) or 2.5 mg QD (daily-dosing group [DG]). Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia was required. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) as determined by an independent review committee (IRC); secondary endpoints included complete response rate (CRR), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety and tolerability. All radiology-based endpoints were confirmed by an IRC. Results: At data cutoff for the primary analysis (Jan 15, 2021), 108 pts naive to prior BTK inhibitor had been treated (WG, n=31; DG, n=77). Median (range) age was 72.0 (43-90) years, 79.6% of pts were male, 92.6% had ECOG PS \u22641, and median (range) time since initial diagnosis was 3.6 (0.1-20.9) years. Among all pts, 63.9% had received 1 line and 25.9% had received 2 lines of prior systemic therapy (median [range], 1 [1-3]); 31.5% of pts had prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and 50.0% had relapsed and 43.5% were refractory to their most recent prior therapy. 78 pts (72.2%) had discontinued treatment; primary reasons were progressive disease in 49 (45.4%) and adverse events in 25 (23.1%) pts. Median (range) treatment duration and follow-up from first dose to data cutoff were 8.3 (0.1-30.0) and 22.9 (11.6-35.9) months for all pts, and 7.9 (1.7-27.4) and 18.2 (11.6-35.9) months for DG, respectively. The ORR (95% CI) was 68.5% (58.9-77.1) for all pts and 70.1% (58.6-80.0) for the DG ( Table 1 ); CRR (95% CI) was 17.6% (10.9-26.1) for all pts and 15.6% (8.3-25.6) for the DG. Among all treated pts with complete or partial response, 89.2% of responses occurred at the first disease assessment. Median (95% CI) DOR was 13.7 (9.0-19.9) months for all pts and 12.1 (9.0-not estimable) months for the DG. Median (95% CI) PFS was 11.99 (8.3-16.9) months for all pts and 13.6 (10.0-16.9) months for the DG. Median OS was not reached. Among 108 treated pts, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 90.7% (n=98) pts (grade \u22653 in 62.0% [n=67]). The most common TEAEs were diarrhea (34.3%), pyrexia (17.6%), and constipation (13.0%); most common grade \u22653 TEAEs were diarrhea (13.9%) and neutropenia (8.3%). TEAEs leading to dose interruption or dose reduction occurred in 47.2% and 8.3% of all pts, respectively. TEAEs led to treatment discontinuation in 25.0% of all pts; the most common were diarrhea (11.1%), colitis (4.6%), and hypokalemia (2.8%). Serious TEAEs occurred in 42.6% (n=46) of all pts; the most common were diarrhea (9.3%) and colitis (4.6%). Six pts (5.6%) overall experienced fatal TEAEs. Conclusion: Parsaclisib monotherapy demonstrated a rapid and durable response, had an acceptable safety profile, and was generally well tolerated in BTK inhibitor-naive pts with R/R MCL. These data suggest that parsaclisib could be a potential treatment option for pts with R/R MCL.
