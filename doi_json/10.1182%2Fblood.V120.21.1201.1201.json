    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1201 In acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL), there is a failure of megakaryocytes to differentiate, become polyploid and stop dividing. We used an integrated screening approach that included chemical, proteomic and genetic screens to identify small molecules and their targets that control polyploidization and differentiation of normal and malignant megakaryocytes. We identified several small molecule inducers of polyploidy and used siRNA and proteomic target ID approaches to determine the cellular targets of the lead small molecule dimethylfasudil (diMF). Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) was identified as one of the top targets of diMF. AURKA is an attractive target in AMKL for several reasons. First, AURKA is overexpressed in AMKL cells. Second, at the biologically effective doses used in our cell-based assays, AURKA inhibition was selective for the megakaryocyte lineage. Third, AURKA inhibition by diMF or the selective AURKA inhibitor MLN8237 increased MK polyploidy, induced features of differentiation, blocked proliferation of AMKL blasts, and improved survival in an AMKL mouse model. AURKA is important in mitotic spindle assembly, mitosis, chromosomal alignment and segregation. Moreover, it is required for embryonic development, as Aurka \u2212/\u2212 embryos fail to grow beyond the blastocyst stage. However, the extent to which AURKA is necessary for steady state hematopoiesis in adults is unknown. To investigate the necessity of AURKA in hematopoiesis, we utilized a conditionally targeted strain of mice ( Aurka flox/flox ). To delete AURKA in megakaryocytes ex vivo, Aurka flox/flox bone marrow cells were expanded, transduced with a retrovirus expressing Cre and GFP, and then cultured in the presence of THPO for 72 hours. We found that deletion of AURKA resulted in increased CD41 and CD42 expression as well as increased DNA content. Assays for apoptosis by Annexin V staining of Aurka flox/flox cells infected with Cre also showed increased apoptosis in AURKA-deleted cells at 24 and 48 hours. To delete AURKA in vivo, we crossed Aurka flox/flox mice to MX1-Cre mice and injected wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous floxed mice expressing MX1-Cre with pIpC every other day for six days. We found that deletion of AURKA in hematopoietic progenitors leads to pancytopenia, profound bone marrow defects and death within two weeks. Colony formation assays showed significantly decreased myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocyte colony formation with AURKA deficiency. Bone marrow histology displayed markedly hypocellular marrow, but curiously, flow cytometry revealed a significant increase in the percentage of CD41 and CD42 positive cells. This observation suggests that AURKA normally acts to restrain terminal differentiation of megakaryocytes and is consistent with the CD41 and CD42 inducing ability of AURKA inhibitors. To confirm that AURKA is the key target of our recently identified polyploidy inducers, we assayed the effects of diMF and MLN8237 on Aurka +/+ , Aurka +/\u2212 and Aurka \u2212/\u2212 megakaryocytes. 300 nM diMF and 100 nM MLN8237, concentrations that strongly induce polyploidy, did not increase MK polyploidization in Aurka \u2212/\u2212 MKs. diMF and MLN8237 treatment increased polyploidy in Aurka +/\u2212 MKs with no significant difference in comparison to Aurka +/+ MKs. We also assayed the ability of wild-type or the T217D mutant of AURKA, which is resistant to inhibition by MLN8237, to reduce the induction of polyploidy caused by diMF and MLN8237 upon overexpression. CMK cells were infected with viruses harboring wild-type or T217D AURKA, treated with DMSO, 3 \u03bcM diMF or 30 nM MLN8237 for 72 hours, and then evaluated for DNA content. The increase in polyploidization induced by both compounds was significantly decreased in cells overexpressing the T217D mutant of AURKA. With overexpression of the wild-type AURKA, there was a trend towards reduction in polyploidy, but more variable effects and no significant difference. Thus, AURKA T217D overexpression reduced the ability of diMF and MLN8237 to induce polyploidization, consistent with our conclusion that diMF targets AURKA. Together, our data support a role of AURKA in megakaryocyte polyploidization and differentiation and show that AURKA is required for steady state hematopoiesis. The results also show that AURKA is the key target of diMF in the induction of polyploidization of megakaryocytes and support the development of Aurora A kinase inhibitors in clinical trials for AMKL.
