    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Despite progress in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) over the past few decades, long-term survival of children, adolescents and young adults remains poor. Most treatment failure is secondary to the development of chemotherapy resistance resulting in relapsed or refractory disease. Epigenetic changes in leukemia cells, such as DNA methylation and/or histone acetylation, can lead to alterations in gene expression thereby causing resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. These epigenetic changes are potentially reversible with agents that demethylate DNA and/or inhibit histone deacetylation which ultimately leads to restoration of normal gene expression and chemosensitivity. We are reporting an ongoing phase I trial of decitabine and vorinostat, two epigenetic modifying agents, followed by chemotherapy in children, adolescents and young adults with relapsed or refractory AML. Methods: T2016-003 is a phase I study that was developed and activated in the TACL consortium in July 2017 for patients 1 to 25 years of age with relapsed or refractory AML. The study followed a standard 3 + 3 phase I cohort escalation design. Three dose levels of decitabine were investigated: dose level 1 (7.5 mg/m 2 ); dose level 2 (10 mg/m 2 ); and dose level 3 (15 mg/m 2 ). Patients received decitabine (at assigned dose level) and vorinostat (age <18 years, 180 mg/m 2 once daily; >18 years, 200 mg twice daily) days 1 to 5 followed by fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 , days 6 to 10), cytarabine (2000 mg/m 2 , days 6 to 10) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (5 \u03bc/kg/dose, days 5 until neutrophil recovery) (FLAG). Intrathecal therapy was given up to 72 hours prior to the initial doses of decitabine/vorinostat, with additional intrathecal therapy for central nervous system disease. Patients could receive up to two cycles of therapy. End of course evaluation by bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD) testing using flow cytometry was performed between days 35 and 42 or upon adequate blood count recovery. Results: Twenty-five patients have enrolled to date with 24 evaluable for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and response. Median age was 7 (range, 1 to 20) years. Fourteen patients (58.3%) had relapsed after a prior bone marrow transplant and 7 (29.2%) had refractory disease at time of enrollment. There were no dose limiting toxicities at dose level 1 (n=3, 7.5 mg/m 2 ) or 2 (n=3, 10 mg/m 2 ) of decitabine. However, at dose level 3 (n=12, 15 mg/m 2 ), 3 subjects reported Grade 4 invasive fungal infection (A spergillus terreus , Candida parapsilosis and Rhizomucor pusillus ) leading to de-escalation of decitabine to dose level 2. The study continued dose expansion at dose level 2 without DLT, enrolling 7 additional patients. Twenty-two subjects have completed the study and are evaluable for response. Responses were noted at all dose levels. Eight subjects (36.4%) achieved a complete response (CR) or complete response with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi). Five of the 8 subjects who achieved a CR/CRi were also negative for MRD. Eight subjects had known epigenetic lesions (i.e. KMT2Ar, CEBP\u03b1, IDH2) with 6 (75%) achieving a CR, 4 of whom (66.7%) were also MRD negative. Conclusion: Overall, we identified decitabine (10 mg/m 2 ) in combination with vorinostat and followed by FLAG chemotherapy to be well-tolerated and an effective regimen in pediatric patients with relapsed AML, particularly in subjects with known epigenetic lesions. The study continues to enroll at dose level 2 of decitabine for a total accrual goal of 33 subjects. Correlative analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow investigating methylation, histone acetylation and gene expression is ongoing. Disclosures Burke: Amgen, Inc.: Consultancy, Speakers Bureau."
