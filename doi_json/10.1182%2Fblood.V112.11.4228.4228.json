    "abstract_text": "Objective: To evaluate the changes of the mTOR/S6 signal transduction pathway of CD33 + cell in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and the effect of imatinib and rapamycin on it. Since the RAPA could influenced the immunity of T cell, the changes of expression of IFN-\u03b3 in CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 \u2212 and CD3 + CD8 + T cell was evaluated after treating with RAPA. Methods: By flow cytometry, the contents of p-mTOR and p-S6 in CD33 + cells were detected in the new diagnosed CML, CML treated with imatinib or hydroxycarbamide and interferon (HU+IFN), CML resisted imatinib, and normal control, or after treated with RAPA in vitro, respectively. Then expression of IFN-\u03b3 in CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 \u2212 and CD3 + CD8 + T cell in patients with higher levels of p-mTOR/p-S6 was measured after RAPA. Results: The contents of p-mTOR and p-S6 in CD33 + cell in the primary CML were higher than that in the normal control m (9.53\u00b17.87)%vs(2.43\u00b12.54)% GP<0.05 ] [ (7.64\u00b13.17)%vs(1.21\u00b11.44)%; P<0.05 ], could be reduced by RAPA in vitro [ (9.53\u00b17. 87)%vs(3.64\u00b13.29)%, p<0.05 ], [ (7.64\u00b13.17)%vs(1.85\u00b12.51)%; P < 0.05 ]. The contents of p-mTOR in CD33 + cell in the patients treated with imatinib were higher than that of the group with HU+IFN [( 10.61\u00b113.70 ) % vs (3.67\u00b14.59 ) %; P<0.05 ], could be reduced by RAPA [( 10.61\u00b113.70)%vs(3.86\u00b18.99)% G P<0.05 ]. p-mTOR in CD33 + cell exceeded the 95% confidence interval of primary CML in 25.7% of patients treated with imatinib, and it was reduced by RAPA [ (29.89\u00b114.89)%vs(8.26\u00b115.45)% GP<0.05 ]. There were no difference in the contents of p-mTOR in CD33 + cell between HU+IFN group and the primary CML [ (3.67\u00b14.59)%vs(9.53\u00b17.87)%, P<0.05 ]. Compared to the primary CML, the contents of p-S6 in CD33 + cell of the patients treated with imatinib was not significant different [ (7.64\u00b13.17)%%vs(19.65\u00b130.19) G P>0.05 ], while it was lower in the patients treated with HU+IFN [ (7.64\u00b13.17)%%vs (2.95 \u00b12.70) GP<0.05 ]. p-S6 in CD33 + cell exceeded the 95% confidence interval of primary CML in 25.7% of patients treated with imatinib, and it was reduced by RAPA [ (44.48\u00b119.43)%vs(10.53\u00b112.39)%, P<0.05 ]. RAPA did not influence the expression of IFN-\u03b3 in CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 \u2212 and CD3 + CD8 + T cell in patients with higher levels of p-mTOR/p-S6 [( 24.69\u00b110.86)%vs(24.32\u00b112.08)% GP>0.05 ], [( 18.79\u00b18.72)%vs(17.0\u00b16.53)% GP>0.05 ], [( 31.59\u00b112.86)%vs(30.45\u00b114.99)% GP>0.05 ]. p-mTOR and p-S6 in CD33 + cell exceeded the 95% confidence interval of the primary CML group were found in 2 cases (20%) in imatinib resistant group, and could be reduced by RAPA in vitro. RAPA did not influence the expression of IFN-\u03b3 in CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 \u2212 and CD3 + CD8 + T cell in these 2 patients. Conclusion: The mTOR/S6 signal transduction pathway in CD33 + cell was activated in primary CML patients, and could be blocked by RAPA. In some patients treated with imatinib, the mTOR/S6 signal transduction pathway in CD33 + cell increased, also could be blocked by RAPA. In minority of patients resistant to imatinib, the mTOR/S6 signal transduction pathway in CD33 + cell was activated, and it might participate the resistance to imatinib. RAPA could block it. RAPA did not impact on the immunity of T cell of patients with CML."
