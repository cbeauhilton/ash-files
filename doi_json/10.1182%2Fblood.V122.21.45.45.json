    "abstract_text": "Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is an aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm of young children. The only current curative treatment is bone marrow transplantation. Yet even with this aggressive therapy, \u223c50% of children still die from their disease. Somatic mutations leading to constitutive activation of the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 (also called PTPN11) or of RAS signaling occur in \u223c90% cases of JMML. However, the transcription factors that act downstream of these aberrant signaling events have not been identified. We recently showed that RUNX1 is a direct interacting partner of Shp2 in megakaryocytic cells (Huang et al. 2012. Genes Dev 26: 1587-1601). Moreover, we showed that RUNX1 is normally negatively regulated by src-family kinase (SFK) mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in megakaryocytes and T-lymphocytes, and that Shp2 contributes to RUNX1 tyrosine dephosphorylation. We now show that overexpression of a mutant RUNX1 (RUNX1 Y260F, Y375F, Y378F, Y379F, Y386F , \u201cRUNX1-5F\u201d), which is expected to mimic constitutive dephosphorylation by Shp2 in murine Lin - Sca-1 + c-kit + (LSK) bone marrow cells is resistant to SFK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and leads to a dramatic expansion of CFU-M/CFU-GM and Gr1 + Mac1 + cells in vitro and in vivo . In contrast, these effects are not seen when wild type RUNX1 or RUNX1 Y260D, Y375D, Y378D, Y379D, Y386D (\u201cRUNX1-5D\u201d; mimicking constitutive RUNX1 tyrosine phosphorylation) are overexpressed. The RUNX1-5F expressing cells also have increased replating activity in serial colony forming assays, increased proliferation (BrdU incorporation), decreased apoptosis, and reduced cytokine dependence. This partially phenocopies conditional knock-in mice that express JMML associated activating Shp2 mutations. Flow sorted Gr1 + Mac1 + cells from the RUNX1-5F transduced cultures expressed higher levels of the direct RUNX1 target gene PU.1 , which plays a role in myelomonocytic growth, and Cyclin D1 . To test whether RUNX1 is required for the myelomonocytic hyperproliferation in JMML, CD34+ peripheral blood cells from a patient with JMML and known activating Shp2 mutation (Shp2 E76G ) were lentivirally transduced with doxycycline-inducible RUNX1-5D or RUNX1-5F expression constructs and cultured under myeloid growth conditions. Upon doxycycline induction, the RUNX1-5D overexpressing cells (resistant to Shp2) exhibited at 32% reduction in BrdU incorporation. In contrast, the control RUNX1-5F expressing cells had no significant reduction in proliferation. These results are consistent with RUNX1 acting as an essential downstream target of activated Shp2 in JMML. As ERK mediated phosphorylation (downstream of RAS/MEK) is also known to increase RUNX1 activity, we propose that RUNX1 may be a common downstream transcriptional target of both activated Shp2 and RAS signaling in the pathogenesis of JMML.
