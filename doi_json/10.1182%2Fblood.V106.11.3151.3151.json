    "abstract_text": "Notch activation has been suggested to promote T cell development at the expense of B cell commitment at the level of a common lymphoid progenitor prior to B cell commitment. Here, we explored the possibility that Notch activation might be able to switch the fate of already committed B cell progenitors towards T cell development upon Notch activation. To address this we overexpressed constitutively activated Notch-3 (N3IC) in B cell progenitors purified from transgenic mice in which human CD25 is expressed under control of the \u03bb5 promoter. Strikingly, whereas untransduced and control transduced B220 + \u03bb5 + CD3 \u2212 B cell progenitors gave rise exclusively to B cells, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells but no B cells were derived from N3IC-transduced cells when transplanted into sublethally irradiated NOD-SCID mice. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that untransduced B220 + \u03bb5 + CD3 \u2212 B cell progenitors expressed \u03bb5 and CD19 but not the T cell specific genes GATA-3, lck and pT\u03b1, whereas CD3 + T cells derived from N3IC-transduced B220 + \u03bb5 + CD3 \u2212 cells failed to express \u03bb5 and CD19, but were positive for GATA-3, lck and pT\u03b1 expression as well as a and b T cell rearrangement. Furthermore, DJ rearrangements were detected at very low levels in CD3 + cells isolated from normal non-transduced BM, but were more abundant in the N3IC-transduced CD3 + BM cells. Noteworthy, N3IC-transduced B220 + \u03bb5 + CD3 \u2212 CD19 + proB cell progenitors failed to generate B as well as T cells, whereas N3IC-transduced B220 + \u03bb5 + CD3 \u2212 CD19 \u2212 pre-proB cells produced exclusively T cells, even when evaluated at low cell numbers. In conclusion Notch activation can switch committed B cell progenitors from a B cell to a T cell fate, but this plasticity is lost at the Pro-B cell stage, upon upregulation of CD19 expression.",
