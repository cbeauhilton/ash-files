    "abstract_text": "Background: We reported that mutations in ASXL1 , EZH2 , IDH1/2 and SRSF2 are negative prognostic variables for survival in primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Patients harboring any one of these mutations comprise IPSS and DIPSS-plus independent high molecular risk (HMR) category. Conversely, prognostic variables in secondary myelofibrosis (sMF), including post-polycythemia vera (PPV) and post-essential thrombocythemia (PET) MF are not defined. Aims: The aim was to evaluate the correlations of HMR mutational status with hematologic characteristics and clinical presentation, and the role for outcome predition, in PPV- and PET-MF. Methods: PPV- and PET-MF were diagnosed by IWG-MRT criteria; all pts provided informed consent. Previously published methods were used to screen mutations involving JAK2, MPL, CALR, EZH2, ASXL1, IDH1/2 and SRSF2 . The prognostic value of the molecular variables with regard to OS was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression. Results: A series of 200 sMF pts from 3 Italian centres was collected: 108 were PPV-MF (54%), 92 PET-MF (46%). PPV-MF cohort: Median age was 65y. Median follow up from PPV-MF diagnosis 4.7y (0.2-25.9y) and median time from PV to PPV-MF 10y (1.08-30.7y). Death occurred in 34 pts (31.8%), 7 pts (6.5%) developed leukemia. Median OS from PPV-MF diagnosis was 9.5y (7.1-11.9y). Frequency of mutations was: JAK2 V617F 100% (median allele burden 77%, range 23-100), ASXL1 17.8%, EZH2 3.7%, IDH 5.6%, SRSF2 1%; 29 patients (26.9%) were classified as HMR cases. Hematologic characteristics: median leucocytes 13.0x10 9 /L, hemoglobin 13.3g/dL, platelets 328x10 9 /L, blasts \u22651% 23.4%. Constitutional symptoms in 45.8%, splenomegaly 94.1% (43.3% >10cm from LCM), pruritus 49%; median percentage of BM cellularity was 90% (25-100%) and grade 3 fibrosis in 16.8%. Overall 73 patients were evaluable for karyotype and abnormalities were detected in 42.5%. We did not find significant correlations between individual mutations or HMR category and hematologic and clinical characteristics. PET-MF cohort: Median age was 63.6y. Median follow up from the PET diagnosis 3.3y (0.2-14.5y), median time from ET to PET-MF 11.8y (0.9-30.6y). Death occurred in 30 pts (32.6%), 11 pts (12.0%) developed leukemia. Median OS from PET-MF diagnosis was 9.2y (4.9-13.6y). Frequency of mutations was: JAK 2V617F 48.9% (median allele burden 49%, range 0-100), CALR 40.2%, MPL 4.3% and triple negativity (TN) 6.5%; ASXL1 29.3%, EZH2 6.5%, IDH 1.1%, SRSF2 3.3%; 33 pts (35.9%) were HMR. Hematologic characteristics: median leucokytes 8.0x10 9 /L, hemoglobin 10.9 g/dL, platelets 375x10 9 /L, blasts \u22651% 26.4%. Constitutional symptoms 35.4% of pts, splenomegaly 82% (18.2% >10cm from LCM), pruritus i31%; median percentage of BM cellularity was 70% (15-90%) and grade 3 fibrosis was found in 31.7%. Overall 56 patients were evaluable for karyotype and abnormalities were detected in 25.0%. By correlating hematologic and clinical characteristics with unique mutations and HMR category, we found that HMR mutated pts presented greater leukocytosis (P=0.04) and higher JAK2 V617F allele burden (P=0.017) than pts in the low-molecular risk \u2013LMR- category (ie, wild-type for ASXL1, EZH2, SRSF2, IDH1/2 ). Comparison of PPV-MF and PET-MF: a comparison of hematologic and clinical characteristics according to the diagnosis sMF disclosed that PPV-MF pts presented more frequently splenomegaly (P=0.008; for >10cm from LCM P<0.001), pruritus (P=0.009), abnormal karyotype (P=0.009), increased leukocytes (P<0.001), higher hemoglobin (P<0.001) and BM cellularity (P<0.001) compared with PET-MF. Conversely, PET-MF pts presented higher incidence of grade 3 of BM fibrosis (P=0.04). The median JAK2 allele burden (P<0.001) was higher in PPV-MF pts, while PET-MF pts showed more frequent mutations of ASXL1 (29.3% vs 17.8%; P=0.03). Univariate analysis disclosed significant correlations between shortened survival and mutated ASXL1 (P=0.02, HR 2.2 95% CI, 1.02-4.8) or EZH2 (P=0.05, HR 5.0 95% CI, 1.0-40.7) in PPV-MF. A HMR category was associated with reduced survival in PPV-MF: median survival 6.1y versus 9.5yr LMR (HR 1.07, 95%CI 1.0-4.4; P=0.04). In PET-MF survival was 4.8y in HMR versus 10.9y in LMR (HR1.6, 95%CI 0.8-3.4; P=0.2). Conclusion: We conclude that a HMR status is associated with shorter survival in sMF, but the overal impact is narrower than in primary MF, even though the rate of mutations is similar (Table1).
