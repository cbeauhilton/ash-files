    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4537 Most of lymphoma patients are chemo- and radiosensitive. Using a conventional therapy we can cure about 50% of patients (pts). Unfortunately the rests achieved only partial remission or have a rapid relapse after treatment. These pts are a real challenge for nowadays hematology. Till now there is not a recommended scheme of therapy. Using high dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) is the most popular one. During the last year in our Department we have been started using BeEAM as the conditioning treatment, and the results of a single centre observation are presented now. Material and Methods Actually: between April, 2011 and February, 2012 we conducted AHCT using BeEAM as conditioning treatment in 23 pts with lymphoma (18 pts with Hodgkin Lymphoma (HLy), 2pts with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 2 pts with T cell lymphoma (TCL), 1 with follicular lymphoma (FL). There were 14 male and 9 female, with a median age of 37,6 (range 21\u201362 yrs). Ann Arbor staging at diagnosis was as follows: II-33%, III-50%, IV-17%; 83% of patients manifested B-symptoms. Clinical manifestation at diagnosis included: enlargement of the lymph nodes (n=18), bone marrow infiltration (n=2), lung infiltrates (n=3). Initially, all patients received at least 2 cycles of chemotherapy; in HLy all pts received ABVD, in non HLy- RCHOP. None of them achieved complete remission (CR). Partial response (PR), defined as the reduction of measurable disease by \u226550% without the appearance of any new lesions, achieved 11pts. The rests underwent high dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by AHCT without remission (NR). Stem cells were collected from peripheral blood after IVE chemotherapy (Ifosfamide 3g/m2 iv in 1\u20133d, Etoposide200mg/m2 iv in 1\u20133d, Epirubicine 50mg iv in1d) and subsequent administration of G-CSF at a dose of 10ug/kg/d, starting from +5 day after chemotherapy till the last day of collection. Collections were performed using Optia Spectra. All pts collected the sufficient number of CD34+ cells for AHCT procedure. Conditioning regimens before AHCT consisted of BeEAM (Bendamustine 200mg/m2 in -8-7d, Etoposide 200mg/m2 in -6-3d, Ara-C 400mg/m2 in -6-3d, Melphalan 140mg/m2 in -2d). A median number of transplanted CD34+ cells was 5,58 (2,05\u201317,8\u00d710 \u2227 6/kg). All except one pt successfully engrafted. 1 pt with Hly died within 8 day after transplantation due to infection. Hematopoietic recovery was as following: WBC count > 1,0\u00d710 \u2227 9/L after median of 12 days (range 9\u201315 days),ANC> 0,5\u00d710 \u2227 9/L after median of 13 days (range 9\u201316 days) and platelet count >20\u00d710 \u2227 9/L after median of 13days (range 7\u201320 days). Results 3 pts died after AHCT. Two of them due to progression of the disease within 5 and 16 months after AHCT. Both were without remission before AHSCT. 1 pt died due to heart insufficient after 3 months after AHCT. The complications after transplantation procedure were rare and included mainly: bacterial infection in the upper respiratory tract (n=3), viral skin infection (n=1), oral mucositis (n=2). At the last contact, 19 pts are alive and 9 of them achieved CR, and 3 \u2013 stable disease. One pt underwent sibling alloHCT and 2 others will undergo alloHCT within 2 months. 4 pts with Hly were treated with anty CD 30+. Conclusion Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation using IVE for mobilization and BeEAM as conditioning is effective treatment for lymphoma patients with refractory disease.
