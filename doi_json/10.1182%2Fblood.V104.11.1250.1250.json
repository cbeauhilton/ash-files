    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a potentially curative treatment of otherwise incurable malignant hematological disorders and severe immunodeficiency diseases. The post-SCT immunoincompetence can last for up to several years and might cause significant morbidity and mortality. Immune reconstitution after SCT has been studied extensively in adults, but only a few reports have been published on a paediatric population or have compared paediatric and adult population. This study was carried out in order to determine the influence of age on quantitative reconstitution of peripheral blood lymphoid subsets. A cohort of 69 adult and 109 paediatric patients received allogeneic SCT from related or unrelated fully HLA matched or 1 locus -mismatched donors for different malignant and non-malignant diseases. Analysis of lymphocyte subsets was performed at various time points: until day 30, between days 31\u201360, 61\u201390, 91\u2013180, 181\u2013365, between 1\u20132 years, between 2\u20135 years and more than 5 years post transplant (at the last time point only paediatric patients were analysed). Comparing the paediatric with adult patients, we observed statistically significant faster recovery of CD19 + , CD19 + CD5 + , CD4 + CD45RA + cells during the whole period of observation, and of total lymphocyte count (TLC) (< 60d and 1-2y), CD3 + (< 60d and 90d-2y), CD3 + HLA-DR + (31-60d), CD3 + CD4 + (< 60d and > 90d), CD4 + CD45R0 + (< 60d), CD3 + CD8 + (< 60d and 90d - 2 y) and CD56 + CD3 \u2212 cells (< 31d) in the paediatric group. Interestingly, the recovery of CD56 + CD3 \u2212 cells was faster from day 61-365 in the adult group (significant faster on day 91\u2013180). The paediatric patients were divided in two subgroups: 1) aged < 10 years; 2) aged > 10 years. The following lymphocyte subsets recovered significant faster in the younger group: TLC (31-60d, 91-365d and > 2y), CD3 + (91-180d and > 1y), CD3 + HLA-DR + (31-60d), CD3 + CD4 + (31-60d and > day 90), CD4 + CD45RA + (61-90d and > day 180), CD4 + CD45R0 + (91-180d and 2-5y), CD3 + CD8 + (91-180d and > 2y), CD19 + (31-60d, 91-180d and 2-5y), CD19 + CD5 + (31-60d, 181-365d and 2-5y) and CD56 + CD3 \u2212 cells (61-180d). The thymopoietic pathway of T helper cells is important throughout childhood; however, the thymus has a diminished capacity for the regeneration of these cells in adulthood. This can be the explanation of the faster recovery of T helper cells in the younger patients in this study. Besides, we found, that paediatric patients have a faster reconstitution of B cells and cytotoxic T cells. This might be because of the higher number of stem cells in the paediatric transplantation.",
