    "abstract_text": "Background CD19, a B cell-specific marker, is expressed in the majority of patients with B-lineage leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. SGN-CD19A is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody conjugated to the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) via a maleimidocaproyl linker. Methods This first-in-human, phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study is investigating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of SGN-CD19A in adult and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell leukemia or highly aggressive lymphoma (NCT 01786096). Eligible patients must have B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or lymphoma (B-LBL), Burkitt leukemia or lymphoma, and be relapsed or refractory to at least 1 prior systemic regimen. A modified continual reassessment method is used for dose allocation and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation for both pediatric and adult patients. The study is evaluating 2 schedules of IV SGN-CD19A administration: weekly (Days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles; 0.3-4.5 mg/kg) or every 3weeks (q3week; 0.5-6 mg/kg). Results To date, 49 patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia (n=40) or lymphoma (n=9) have been treated. Median age of adult (n=38) and pediatric patients (n=11) was 37 and 11 years (range, 18-74 and 1-16), respectively. Patients received a median of 2 prior therapies (range 1-9); 14 patients (29%) previously received an allogeneic stem cell transplant. On the weekly schedule, 39 patients (28 adult, 11 pediatric) have been treated, and the median number of cycles is 2.5 (adults; range, 1-12) or 1 (pediatric; range, 1-4). On the q3week schedule, 10 adult patients have been treated, and the median number of cycles is 2.5 (range, 1-4) to date. Six patients remain on study treatment (3 on each schedule), and enrollment is ongoing. The toxicity profiles were similar across both dosing schedules (0.3-2.3 mg/kg weekly and 4-5 mg/kg q3week) and across adult and pediatric patients. The most frequently reported drug-related AEs included pyrexia, nausea, chills, vomiting, blurred vision, and dry eye. Frequent infusion-related reactions were observed early in the study, and recommendation for premedication was instituted. Ocular events were also observed and treated with ophthalmic steroids; steroid eye drop prophylaxis was instituted with each dose. Corneal findings consistent with superficial microcystic keratopathy were observed in 13 adult patients (34%) and in 1 pediatric patient (9%). Grade 3/4 corneal AEs have been observed in 4 adult patients; the majority of these events have resolved or improved to Grade 1 or 2. Steroid eye drop prophylaxis has reduced the incidence of Grade 3/4 events at this interim analysis. Three DLTs were observed: acidosis in a pediatric patient at 1 mg/kg weekly, cytokine release syndrome in an adult patient at 2 mg/kg weekly, and asymptomatic Grade 4 AST elevation in an adult patient at 5 mg/kg q3week. MTD has not yet been determined. SGN-CD19A ADC pharmacokinetic profiles indicate target-mediated drug disposition in patients with leukemia. Plasma ADC exposures generally increased with doses and were lower than those in patients with lymphoma. To date, no objective responses were observed in 9 efficacy-evaluable pediatric patients or in 3 adult patients with Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia. However, in efficacy-evaluable adult patients with B-ALL/B-LBL, objective responses were observed in 6 of 25 patients treated on the weekly schedule (3 CR, 2 CRp, 1 PR), and in 4 of 8 patients treated on the q3week schedule (2 CR, 2 CRp). Of 8 B-ALL patients with CR/CRp, 6 were MRD negative. Conclusions MTDs have not yet been identified, and dose escalation continues on weekly and q3week schedules. SGN-CD19A has been generally well tolerated. At this interim analysis, objective responses were observed in 30% (10 of 33) of heavily pretreated adult B-ALL/B-LBL patients dosed weekly or q3week. Evidence of activity in relapsed/refractory patients and lack of overlapping toxicities suggest opportunities for combination with conventional anti-leukemic therapies in lymphoblastic malignancies.
