    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Although patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) typically respond to available front-line chemotherapy, the response is often temporary, and patients frequently undergo relapse. The authors report the beneficial clinical activity and tolerability of an immunochemotherapeutic regimen consisting of rituximab added to cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone (R-CVP), in patients with heavily pretreated CLL. Methods: The therapeutic regimen consisted of: cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 iv on day one, vincristine 1.4 mg/m 2 iv on day one and prednisolone 100 mg po for five consecutive days every 4 weeks, combined with rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m 2 on day 1 of each cycle. Patients were evaluated after three cycles, with responding patients receiving up to eight cycles. No infectious prophylaxis was administered. Results: Five patients have been treated with R-CVP: median age 65 years (range 52\u201368), advanced Binet stage (four stage C and one stage B) and heavily pretreated (range 1\u20133 prior therapies). All patients received at least three cycles of R-CVP. Clinical and hematological response was achieved in two patients. Three patients had stable disease. One patient was re-induced once after disease progression. Data from a median follow-up of 112 months (range 52\u2013128 months) showed that three patients remained free of disease progression 8 months after the first cycle of R-CVP (range 2\u201314 months). The principle treatment complication was pulmonary aspergillosis. Conclusion: These promising results suggest salvage therapy with R-CVP is beneficial in patients with heavily pretreated CLL.",
