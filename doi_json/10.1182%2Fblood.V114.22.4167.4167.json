    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4167 [Background] It is important for the progress of the support treatment for AML. It is possible for more than seventy years old patients to cure AML actively. [Purpose] We examined the CMV reactivation after chemotherapy of AML, MDS, and ALL. [Methods] The study design planned to enroll 195 patients. Diagnoses included AML (121), MDS (56), ALL (18). Patients received induction chemotherapy. Induction regimens consisted of IDA (12 mg/m2 per day, day 1, 3, 5 and 8) and BHAC (350 mg/ m2 per day, day 1-10)(= Ara-C 200 mg/ m2 per day, day 1-10). Patients received consolidation chemotherapy. Consolidation chemotherapy comprised of High-dose Ara-C Therapy-containing regimens. We examined the CMV reactivation when patients have fever but they were recovered from the leukocyte decrease term after chemotherapy. [Results] About 10% of patients experienced CMV reactivation. Thirteen of 121 AML patients experienced CMV reactivation. Three of 56 MDS patients experienced CMV reactivation. Four of 18 ALL patients experienced CMV reactivation. [Conclusion] It is important to be careful for CMV reactivation in patients receiving High-dose Ara-C Therapy. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
