    "abstract_text": "Introduction Pralatrexate is an anti-folate approved for relapsed/refractory peripheral Tcell lymphoma. \u00a0Pralatrexate also had high activity and acceptable toxicity when used as a single agent in a dose finding phase 1/II study of 54 patients with relapsed/refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).\u00a0 The response rate was 45% in 29 patients treated at an optimal dose of 15 mg/m 2 /week for 3 of 4 weeks. \u00a0In a second international multicenter Phase I/II dose finding trial, the optimal dose of praletrexate from the first trial was combined 150- 300 mg/m 2 bexarotene. \u00a0Eligibility was based on ECOG < 2 and MF stage > IB with \u2265 one prior systemic therapy.\u00a0 Pralatrexate was administered at 15 mg/m 2 weekly via intravenous push for 3 of 4\u00a0weeks each cycle.\u00a0 The MTD for bexarotene was 150 mg/m2 taken orally daily with food and supplemented with both levothyroxine and atovastatin.\u00a0 All patients on praletrexate received bi-monthly vitamin B 12 and daily folic acid supplementation.\u00a0\u00a0 Response to therapy was determined by a composite score consisting of the \u00a0modified skin assessment tool (mSWAT), lymph nodes by CT scan, and blood flow cytometry. Results The ORR for both trials at our site was 42% (11/26).\u00a0 The ORR in the Phase I dose finding trial of praletrexate alone was 4/12 (33%).\u00a0 The ORR in the pralatrexate plus bexarotene trial was 7/14 (50%).\u00a0 Ten of 26 patients enrolled in both trials received more than 9 cycles of praletrexate: 3 on pralatrexate and 7 on the pralatrexate/bexatotene combination ( Table 1 ). There were 4 females and 6 males with median age of 71 years (range 41-82 years). Their clinical stagies were 4 with IIB, 1 with IIIB, 4 with IVA, and 1 with IVB. \u00a0They received a median of 13 cycles (range 9-23).\u00a0 The median number of prior therapies was 4 (range, 2\u20135). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Median time to response was 15.75 weeks (range 4-24 weeks) and the median duration of response was 26.75 weeks (range 8.5-49.5 weeks). Because there are still 4 responding subjects in ongoing therapy, the mean duration of response underestimates the true duration. \u00a0Two patients (Table 1*) presented with lower leg tumors that responded to therapy leaving residual chronic leg ulcers and are on long term active treatment.

PR IVA 9 (15 mg/m 2 + 300 mg/m 2 ) PR IIB 9 (15 mg/m 2 + 150 mg/m 2 ) PR IVB 13 (15 mg/m 2 + 150 mg/m 2 ) PR IVA 13 (15 mg/m 2 + 150 mg/m 2 ) PR* IIB 13 (15 mg/m 2 + 150 mg/m 2 ) PR IVA 13 (15 mg/m 2 + 150 mg/m 2 ) PR IVA 13 (15 mg/m 2 + 150 mg/m 2 ) PR* IIB 23 (15 mg/m 2 ) PR IIIB 10 (15 mg/m 2 ) PR IIB 12 (15 mg/m 2 ) View Large The most common related adverse events of any grade were stomatitis (Grade 1-2) (n=8), neutropenia (n=5), headaches (n=3), dizziness (n=3), nausea (n=3), fatigue (n=2). \u00a0The dosing frequency of three out of four weeks was reduced to every other week at 10 mg/m2 in three of 10 long term responders. Summary/Conclusions Praletrexate alone or in combination with low dose oral bexarotene is active and capable of long term durable responses in CTCL patients with advanced age and stage.\u00a0 The combination of 150 mg/m2 of bexarotene with 15 mg/m2 of praletrexate was well tolerated and had a better profile than praletrexate alone at our center.
