    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2104 Mutations inactivating the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) cause impaired erythroid iron utilization and lead to the development of hypochromic microcytic anemia associated with ineffective erythropoiesis (IE). The anemia can be ameliorated with high-dose erythropoietin (EPO) therapy (Pospisilova D, et al. Blood. 2006. 108:404\u20135). In contrast to \u03b2-thalassemia mouse model with dramatically elevated EPO levels which were proposed to protect erythroid cells from apoptosis (Libani IV, et al. Blood. 2008. 112:875\u2013885), DMT1-mutant mice ( mk/mk ) have only 2.8-fold higher EPO levels when compared to the wild-type littermates. This corresponds to 2-fold elevation of serum EPO above the normal range for DMT-1-mutant patient before initiation of EPO therapy. Different mechanisms may therefore drive IE in anemia due to DMT1 mutation. In this study we analyzed the bases for the clinical success of high-dose EPO supplementation in a DMT1-mutant patient and mk/mk mice. EPO administration significantly increased hemoglobin levels (7.4 g/dL to 9.1 g/dL for the patient and 7.5\u00b10.6 to 9.5\u00b10.4 g/dL for mk/mk mice) and partially ameliorated IE. Colony forming assay using patient's cells showed significantly improved in vitro growth of post-treatment DMT1-mutant burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) progenitors when compared to pre-treatment BFU-Es. In addition, the reduced plating efficiency and colony-forming capacity of pre-treatment DMT1-mutant BFU-Es can be corrected by the addition of the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk to the cultures. This indicates involvement of caspase-dependent apoptosis in the defective survival of pre-treatment BFU-E progenitors and in their impaired capacity to form erythroid colonies. TUNEL assay on patient's bone marrow smears showed markedly decreased rate of apoptosis (from 4% to 1.5% of TUNEL-positive erythroblasts) after EPO supplementation. No profound changes in erythroblast maturation were noted in post-treatment bone marrow with the exception of additional expansion of polychromatophilic pool suggesting that inhibition of apoptosis rather than increased differentiation of DMT1-mutant erythroid cells predominantly accounts for amelioration of anemia and IE. In accordance with the patient's results, EPO administration to mk/mk mice did not alter the distribution of erythroblasts of different maturation stages. On the other hand, augmented STAT5 activation and enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-X L and MCL-1 was detected in EPO treated mice. This correlated with decreased number of erythroid Ter119+ precursors undergoing apoptosis in EPO treated mk/mk bone marrow (12.4\u00b12.3% to 5.4\u00b10.9%) and spleen (7.3\u00b10.7% to 3.1\u00b10.9%). EPO supplementation also significantly reduced susceptibility of mk/mk erythrocytes to undergo stress-induced death that could reflect increased eryptosis (apoptosis of DMT1-mutant erythrocytes) in vivo and protective effect of EPO. Low to undetectable expression of hepcidin in mk/mk liver could be attributed to 16-fold increase in GDF15 expression in the bone marrow; the expression of TWSG1 was comparable to wild-type littermates. Also patient's urinary hepcidin is low (55.3 ng/mg creatinine; normal range 71\u20131762), however, in contrast to mk/mk mice and \u03b2-thalassemia patients the suppression of hepcidin seems to be only partly mediated by GDF15 as patient's GDF15 plasma levels are only 1.9-fold higher (548.4 pg/mL) in comparison to gender- and age-matched controls (288.4\u00b156.9 pg/mL). These results indicate that mouse models may not fully mimic the human disease and suggest existence of additional bone marrow-derived regulator of hepcidin expression. In summary we present the bases for the clinically approved success of EPO treatment under condition of iron-deprived erythropoiesis. We conclude that EPO-driven signaling rescues the survival defect of DMT1-mutant erythroid cells.
