    "abstract_text": "Megakaryocyte endoreplication, maturation and platelet production have all been reported to be affected by developmental stage (Elagib, Exp Hematol 2018). Additionally, we have recently found that P-selectin expression and function are altered in fetal and neonatal murine platelets (Stolla, Blood Adv 2019), suggesting that both megakaryopoiesis and platelet function are developmentally regulated. The developmental regulation of megakaryopoiesis can have important implications regarding platelet production in premature and full-term neonates, platelet regeneration following cord blood transplantation, and the in vitro generation of platelets from iPS cells (Elagib, Exp Hematol 2018). To further explore differences between fetal and adult megakaryocytes, we analyzed primary murine megakaryocytes in the fetal liver and adult bone marrow, and found that fetal megakaryocytes have lower average ploidy as well as increased cell size and initial accumulation of surface GP1bbeta expression at 2N and 4N stages. These latter findings indicate that cytoplasmic maturation begins at lower ploidy stages in fetal versus adult murine megakaryocytes. Consistent with findings in cultured human cord blood versus adult blood-derived progenitors (Liu, Blood 2015), we found lower ploidy and earlier cytoplasmic maturation in cultures of fetal versus adult megakaryocytes. These findings suggest the existence of a cell intrinsic developmental program of megakaryocyte maturation. Global gene expression studies of cultured megakaryocytes derived from fetal liver versus adult bone marrow progenitors revealed differential expression of Gata1, Cyclin D1, Cyclin D2, and Igf2bp3, supporting their proposed roles in fetal versus adult megakaryopoiesis (Klusmann, Genes Dev 2010; Liu, Blood 2011; Elagib, J Clin Invest 2017). Igf1R transcripts were increased in fetal megakaryocytes consistent with their sensitivity to IGF signaling (Klusmann, Genes Dev 2010). In addition, we found increased expression of Lin28b, a negative regulator of Let7 miRNAs, as well as multiple downstream targets of Let7 miRNAs in fetal liver-derived megakaryocytes. Induction of Lin28b expression in adult mice (Zhu, Cell 2011) led to increased expression of Gata1, Cyclin D1, Igf2bp3 and IGF1R in bone marrow-derived megakaryocytes. Interestingly, adult megakaryocyte average ploidy was decreased and the sensitivity to IGF1R inhibition was increased by Lin28b induction, suggesting that the Lin28b axis regulates key aspects of fetal versus adult megakaryopoiesis. The largest category of upregulated genes in adult versus fetal megakaryocyte transcriptomes was immune-related genes, including PPBP, a neutrophil chemotactic cytokine, and beta2M, which we have recently shown to mediate platelet-monocyte interactions (Hilt, JCI Insight 2019). Consistent with the transcriptomic data, neonatal platelets express less MHCI on their surface (an indirect indication of less platelet beta2M protein expression) and release less PPBP post-activation when compared to adult platelets. Activated neonatal platelets induce less neutrophil migration and activation when compared to activated adult platelets. In addition, the releasates from activated neonatal versus adult platelets differentially altered the balance of proinflammatory versus proreparative signaling in monocytes. Finally, the induction of Lin28b expression in adult mice resulted in platelets that express less MHCI, release less PPBP, and induce less neutrophil chemotaxis. Taken together, our studies support the hypothesis that megakaryocyte maturation and resulting platelet-immune cell interactions are developmentally regulated, in part, through a Lin28b-mediated program.
