Apart from major bleeding, infection was a major risk of death of these patients. 1 However, infections after diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia are less addressed in the literature and its clinical impact on outcome of patients with ITP has not been well-addressed. This study aimed to characterize risk of infection events after diagnosis of ITP and its impact on outcome of these patients. We retrospectively evaluated 239 patients (109 men, 130 women; medium age: 63 yr) diagnosed between Jan 1, 1997 to Aug 31, 2011. Every patient received at least steroid treatment according to platelet count or bleeding symptoms after diagnosis. Infection event occurred in 59 patients (24.7%) within 6 months after diagnosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that age (>65 yr) was the most important risk factor regarding to infection (p=0.048, 95% CI 1.005 to 4.007). 1-year mortality rate after ITP diagnosis was significantly higher in those patients with infection after steroid treatment (p<0.001). We conclude that elderly patients with ITP are more prone to infections which have negative impact on post-diagnosis 1 year survival. Table 1.
