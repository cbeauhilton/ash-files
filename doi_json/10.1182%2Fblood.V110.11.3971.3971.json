    "abstract_text": "Nephrotic syndrome is a well known complication of the development of inhibitors in factor IX patients. Nephrotic syndrome has been treated with Rituxan as have factor IX inhibitors. We present a 4 year old male diagnosed with severe factor IX deficiency at 5 months of age after severe bruising. History: Between 11/05 and 5/06 we treated a 3 yo male with history of factor IX deficiency and inhibitor as well as nephrotic syndrome with Rituxan. The child received 4 weekly doses of Rituxan at 375 mg/M 2 , followed by monthly doses at 375 mg/M 2 , for six months. He received monthly doses of IVIG at 1 gram/M 2 . In the last 2 months of the course, he was reexposed to factor IX (Alphanine). Results: He has had no signs of an inhibitor and is on 3x per week dosing. He did redevelop nephrotic syndrome 17 months later but has since been placed in remission on a repeat course of Rituxan. Conclusions: This is the first report of the successful treatment of both a Factor IX inhibitor and Nephrotic syndrome with Rituxan therapy.",
