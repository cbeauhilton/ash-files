    "abstract_text": "Background : Natural killer T (NKT) cells are one of the primary effectors of the innate immune systems, and also have an important role to initiate and regulate adaptive immune responses. Previously, we reported that V\u03b124 + NKT cells proliferated more efficiently from granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) compared with steady-state blood cells. However, optimal culture conditions and characterization of ex vivo expanded NKT cells have not been fully evaluated. Object : We examined several different conditions including cell ratios, mediums, growth factors and incubation schedules to seek an optimal culture system for expansion of NKT cells. Methods : PBMC were collected from donors for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation before and after G-CSF administration, and were cultured in AIM-V medium supplemented with 10% auto-plasma, 100 ng/mL \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GalCer) and 100 U/mL recombinant human (rh) IL-2. IL-2 alone was repeatedly charged every 3 days to maintain its biological activity. After 12 days culture, we compared the expansion efficacy of V\u03b124 + CD3 + NKT cells derived from PBMC with or without G-CSF. For depletion analysis, we used a magnetic cell sorting (MACS) system with labeling magnetic beads-conjugated monoclonal antibody against CD14, 56, 34, and TCR V\u03b124 chain. Results : The expansion fold of V\u03b124 + CD3 + NKT cells were significantly higher with G-CSF (669 vs 182 fold, n=20). Among cell populations we tested, the proportion of CD14 + CD16 + cells before cultures were associated with the efficacy of V\u03b124 + CD3 + NKT cells expansion, and the proportion of CD34 + , V\u03b124 + , CD56 + and CD56 + CD161 + cells were not. The magnitude of expansion of V\u03b124 + CD3 + NKT cells was correlated with the percentage of CD14 + cells at the initiation of cultures. Proliferation of V\u03b124 + CD3 + NKT cells was abrogated by the depletion of V\u03b124 + cells, but notCD34 + cells. Depletion of CD56 + T cells induced higher expansion ratio of V\u03b124 + CD3 + NKT, which was abolished when CD56 + and CD56 \u2212 cells were cultured separately using a 3 \u03bcm pored-membrane filter. Furthermore, co-culture of enriched V\u03b124 + cells and purified CD56 + cells inhibited the proliferation of V\u03b124 + CD3 + NKT cells. It was hypothesized that the repeated IL-2 supplementation resulted in enhancement of CD56 + cells (NK cells) to suppress the proliferation of V\u03b124 + CD3 + NKT cells. We tested different administration schedule of IL-2 as follow: on day 0 only, day 0 & 3, day 0, 3 & 6, day 0, 3, 6 & 9 (that is every 3 days), and we found that V\u03b124 + CD3 + NKT cells expanded most effectively when IL-2 was supplemented on day 0 only. In order to modify the number of CD14 + cells in culture system, we added back CD14 + cells to CD14 \u2212 cells culture on day 0, 3, 6, 9 or every 3 days, but this did not result in significant enhancement of proliferation of V\u03b124 + CD3 + NKT cells. Conclusions : For efficient ex vivo culture of V\u03b124+ NKT cells, the presence of V\u03b124 + NKT cells and CD14 + cells are critical. The NK cells may interfere the interaction between antigen presenting cells (APC) and NKT cells by hindering a function of antigen presentation or yielding direct cytotoxicity against APC. These findings are helpful to develop an efficient expansion system of NKT cells in feature adaptive immunotherapy.",
