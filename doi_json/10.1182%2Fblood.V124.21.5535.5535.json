    "abstract_text": "Background: To explore a real incidence of dasatinib-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (D-PAH) in clinical practice, we investigated 82 imatinib or other 2G tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-failed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients who received dasatinib as a second-line therapy. Methods: Routine chest X-ray and Doppler echocardiography were regularly evaluated in all patients and additional tests were performed if dyspnea developed on treatment. Results: Median age at the time of starting dasatinib was 48 (16-82) years. Of 82 patients, 8 patients (9.8%) showed an elevation of right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP>35mmHg) by Doppler echocardiography. Among them, 7 patients (8.5%) were considered D-PAH with a median dasatinib treatment duration of 32.6 (10.3-108.7) months. They underwent follow-up Doppler echocardiography median 5 (2-9) times. Five patients showed severe D-PAH (RVSP >70mmHg), 1 was moderate (RVSP 46mmHg), and 1 was mild (RVSP 41mmHg). Advanced studies such as pulmonary angiographic catheterization (patient 1 and 2) or pulmonary arterial computed tomography (patient 3 and 4) were performed for confirming D-PAH or ruling out PAH due to pulmonary vascular abnormality. Six patients had bilateral pleural effusion and 1 had unilateral pleural effusion. With sildenafil (n=5) + dose reduction (n=1) + switch to other TKI (n=6), all of patients improved dyspnea, and RVSP level was completely resolved in 3 patients. In addition, previous nilotinib therapy and concomitant pleural effusion were significant contributing factors for D-PAH. Conclusion: Regardless of complete resolution of pleural effusion, a patient with sustained dyspnea on dasatinib treatment should be carefully evaluated by Doppler echocardiography and a regular monitoring will be needed for early intervention.
