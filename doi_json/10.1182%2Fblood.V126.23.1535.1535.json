    "abstract_text": "Background Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common lymphoma in adults. Although responsive to therapies it is still considered incurable. The introduction of the CD20 antibody rituximab is well known to have improved outcome. Rituximab acts through complement-mediated cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and direct induction of apoptosis. To enhance the efficacy of rituximab, different combination regimens have been used, mostly with chemotherapy but also with cytokines. Lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory agent commonly used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, has been shown to induce durable responses with manageable toxicity in indolent lymphomas and mantle cell lymphoma, especially in combination with rituximab. It acts on both the malignant cells and their microenvironment. The drug modulates signaling pathways, enhances the capacity of T cells and increases ADCC by natural killer (NK) cells, as well as suppresses angiogenesis. When combined with rituximab, the clinical effects seem to be synergistic (Fowler 2014). We aimed to investigate the dynamics of immune cell subsets in peripheral blood in patients given rituximab with or without lenalidomide. Patients and Methods FL patients included in a multicenter randomized phase II trial performed by the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) in collaboration with the Nordic Lymphoma Group (NLG) were randomized 1:1 to treatment either with rituximab alone or rituximab and lenalidomide. Inclusion criteria were histologically confirmed CD20+ FL grade 1, 2 or 3A in disease stage Ann Arbor III-IV (or II not suitable for radiotherapy). Patients had to be in need of systemic therapy because of clinical symptoms, cytopenia, bulky disease or significant disease progression. In both treatment arms rituximab was administered as 4 single infusions of 375 mg/m 2 weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4; in patients who showed at least a minor response 4 additional infusions were administered at weeks 12, 13, 14 and 15. In the combination arm, lenalidomide, 15 mg p.o. daily, was started 14 days before the first infusion and given continuously until 14 days after the last. Peripheral blood cells were sequentially sampled: at baseline, after 2 weeks' use of lenalidomide, 24 hours after first rituximab infusion and at follow-up at weeks 10 and 23. Analyses of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+CD3- (NK) cells were performed with flow cytometry. Results Immune cell activity was assessed on blood samples of 28 Norwegian and Swedish patients until July 2015. In all patients, irrespective of treatment arm, NK cell numbers markedly decreased at 24 hours after the first rituximab infusion compared to baseline counts (P=0.046), but returned to baseline levels by week 10 in most. However, patients in the combination arm exhibited a heterogeneous response with a diverse NK cell depletion/proliferation pattern, some showing a transient rise already after 14 days of lenalidomide use (Figure 1). CD3 levels were not affected at 24 hours after rituximab but increased over time in 15 of 18 patients (without differences between treatment arms). The increase at week 23 was statistically significant (P=0.004) with a median of 1.4 x 10 9 /L CD3+ cells compared to a baseline median of 0.88 x 10 9 /L. In all patients, independent of treatment arm, the CD4/CD8 ratio increased compared to baseline already 24 hours after rituximab (P=0.011) and persisted throughout the study (week 10, P=0,005; week 23, P=0.019). The increased ratio was due to a large rise in CD4 counts (week 10, P=0.014; week 23, P=0.003), and a less pronounced rise in CD8 counts (week 10, P=0.094; week 23, P=0.007; Figure 2). Conclusion We found changes in the composition of immune cell subsets in peripheral blood in rituximab treated FL patients, with a larger interindividual variation when combined with lenalidomide. Ongoing analyses will reveal whether these patterns of immune cell response correlate with clinical outcome and long-term treatment effects. Figure 1.
