    "abstract_text": "Agents targeting not only myeloma cells directly but also bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), endothelial cells, and osteoclasts (OCLs) that cause enhancement of tumor cell growth, angiogenesis, and MM bone disease, respectively, are promising new treatment modalities for multiple myeloma. Here we investigated the novel, orally available multi-kinase inhibitor BAY 73-4506 (BAY), currently in phase II clinical trials, for its therapeutic effect in MM. BAY is a potent inhibitor of angiogenic (VEGFR 1\u20133, PDGFR-\u03b2), as well as oncogenic, (cKIT, RET, FGFR, Raf) kinases We first tested the ability of BAY to suppress proliferation and survival in a wide array of MM cell lines, including those resistant to conventional chemotherapeutics. Our data show that BAY, in a low micromolar range that is well below concentrations achieved in patient plasma during the first clinical trial in solid tumors, induces apoptosis by caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation in all cell lines tested. Importantly, BAY also overcomes the growth advantage conferred in a BMSC-MM, as well as an endothelial cell-MM, co-culture system. BAY treatment abrogates growth factor-stimulated MEK, ERK and AKT phosphorylation at sub-micromolar concentrations. Since the VEGF signaling pathway is a potent inducer of angiogenesis and BAY targets VEGFR 1\u20133, we examined its anti-angiogenic properties. BAY inhibits endothelial cell growth and endothelial cell tubule formation in vitro at concentrations less than 1\u03bcM; moreover, it also markedly inhibited VEGF-induced cell migration on fibronectin. Activation of MAP kinase is a critical event during OCL differentiation, activation, and survival; and importantly, BAY also inhibits osteoclastogenesis, evidenced by blockade of M-CSF/RANKL-triggered differentiation of mononuclear cells to TRAP-positive osteoclasts. Finally, BAY significantly delays tumor growth and abrogates blood vessel formation in vivo in a xenograft mouse model of human MM. These in vitro and in vivo results provide the basis for further clinical evaluation of BAY to improve patient outcome in MM.",
