    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1875 Introduction: Carfilzomib (CFZ) is a next-generation proteasome inhibitor that has demonstrated durable single-agent antitumor activity in patients (pts) with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM). Previously we have shown that unfavorable cytogenetic features, defined as presence of any of del 13 or hypodiploidy by metaphase cytogenetic analysis and/or del 17p13, t(4;14), t (14;16) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), did not appreciably affect overall (\u2265PR) and clinical benefit (\u2265MR) response rates (ORR and CBR) in PX-171-003-A1, a large phase 2 study of single-agent CFZ in pts with R/R MM (Jakubowiak et al. Ann Oncol . 2011;22(S4): Abstract 117). The objectives of the present analysis were to evaluate the impact of specific cytogenetic abnormalities on efficacy and treatment outcomes. Methods: Pts with unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities (defined above) were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. All pts received CFZ at 20 mg/m 2 IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of 28-day cycles (C) and were dose-escalated to 27 mg/m 2 at C2. Pts were treated for up to 12 C. Responses were assessed by International Myeloma Working Group criteria, with minimal response (MR) by European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria. Assessments were confirmed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC). Results: A total of 234 pts were included in this analysis. Metaphase cytogenetic data were available for 203 pts (87%), and FISH data were available for 210 pts (90%); 178 pts had both (76%). Seventy-five of 234 pts (32%) had \u22651 abnormality and represented the unfavorable group in this analysis. Of these, 49 (65%) had abnormalities detected via metaphase cytogenetics, 47 (63%) by FISH, and 21 (28%) by both methods. Characteristics of pts in the unfavorable and normal/favorable groups were comparable overall, with the exception of a higher proportion of pts with International Staging System stage II/III in the unfavorable group (83% vs 64%). Response rates per the IRC, presented previously, included an ORR of 30% for pts with \u22651 abnormality compared with 23% for pts with none. The corresponding CBRs were 34% and 40%, respectively. Duration of response (DOR) and time to progression (TTP) values were 7 months (mo) (95% CI 4\u20139) and 4 mo (95% CI 3\u20136), respectively, for pts with \u22651 abnormality and 8 mo (95% CI 6\u201312) and 5 mo (95% CI 3\u20136), respectively, for pts with none. The ORRs, CBRs, and disease control rates (DCRs) according to specific cytogenetic abnormalities are presented below. Response rates were largely unaffected by the presence of specific unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities, with the possible exceptions of trends toward a higher response rate for t(4;14) and a lower rate for t(14;16), although the latter abnormality was only noted in 3 pts.  .

Data cutoff date 11 February 2011. View Large The trend for better response rates in pts with t(4;14) corresponded to a DOR of 5.6 mo (95% CI 2.8\u201310.2). In contrast, the DOR appeared shorter for the subgroup of pts with del 17p13 (4.6 mo, 95% CI: 3.7\u2013Not reached). Time-to-event endpoints including TTP are being analyzed for these and the other subpopulations, and data on these will be presented, along with overall survival stratified by cytogenetic abnormality. Conclusions: CFZ demonstrated comparable response rates in pts with relapsed/refractory MM in both the absence and presence of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities in the 003-A1 study. Similarly, in the phase 2 PX-171-004 study, no significant difference in response rates between unfavorable and normal/favorable groups has been observed in a population of less heavily-pretreated pts with relapsed or R/R MM. Taken together, the results of these and other analyses to date suggest that responses to single-agent CFZ can be achieved in heavily pretreated pts and that overall, these responses appear not to be significantly influenced by poor prognostic cytogenetic features. Further analyses from studies with CFZ in newly diagnosed MM and in less heavily-pretreated pts are needed to determine whether a trend toward lower response rates and DOR for pts with del 17p13 is consistently observed in other populations.
