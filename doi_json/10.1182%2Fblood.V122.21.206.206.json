    "abstract_text": "Introduction Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare bleeding disorder, resulting from auto-antibodies to human factor VIII (hFVIII). The challenges created by the management of AHA and the co-morbidities present in this typically elderly population, can be managed by a recombinant, highly pure, B-domain deleted, porcine sequence FVIII (OBI-1) that is not generally susceptible to the inhibitory activity of anti-human FVIII antibodies. Treatment with OBI-1 allows for monitoring of FVIII levels which provides a reproducible and objective surrogate predictor of hemostasis. Eradication of hFVIII inhibitors with immunosuppressive therapy is critical for disease management. During immunosuppression, the patient transitions from a bleeding state at initial presentation to a relative hypercoagulable state which can be an issue in patients who are susceptible to thromboembolic events due to their comorbidities. This transition period is of most concern especially when using traditionally utilized bypassing agents that cannot be monitored. OBI-1 enables measurement of FVIII levels, guiding dosing and enhancing treatment safety during this critical period. Methods This global, prospective, multi-center phase 2/3 open label clinical trial investigates the efficacy and safety of OBI-1 in the treatment of serious bleeds in adults with AHA conducted under ICH guidelines and local IRB/Ethics Committee oversight. Primary efficacy endpoint was assessed at 24 hours (eg. effective, partially effective). All subjects (N= 18) presented with a serious bleed and were treated with an initial dose of OBI-1 (200 U/kg), followed by additional doses based on the subject's target factor VIII levels, anti-OBI-1 titer, and clinical factors. Results In all 18 subjects, a positive response (14 effective/4 partially effective) to treatment was observed at 24 hours. This positive response to OBI-1 treatment was seen by 8 hours in 14/18 of the subjects and at 16 hours in 16/18 of the subjects. Median total exposure to OBI-1 per subject was 1782.5 U/kg. The median total first dose was 14,000 U. For subjects who received additional doses of OBI-1, the median dose was reduced from the initial dose, but did not differ considerably over subsequent doses (9180 to 13561 U; median 11000 U). The majority of subjects (17/18) received concomitant immunosuppressive therapies. No related serious adverse reactions occurred. Non-serious adverse events related to treatment were noted in 5/18 (27.8%) subjects. One subject had mild tachycardia, hypotension and constipation. One subject had 2 instances of mild PICC line occlusion. One subject had a mild hypofibrogenemia. All of these adverse effects completely resolved. Three subjects developed anti-porcine inhibitors after infusion of study drug (range 8-108 BU) and two were discontinued from treatment. Anti-porcine inhibitors were detected prior to infusion in 6/18 patients (range 0.8-29 BU). All of these subjects had a favorable clinical response at 24 hours post-OB-1 infusions. Conclusions Data from this prospective study demonstrate OBI-1 as a safe and effective treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with AHA, with the added advantage over other bypass therapies of allowing FVIII monitoring throughout treatment and healing phase.
