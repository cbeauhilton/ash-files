    "abstract_text": "Abstract 130 Multiple myeloma (MM) bone marrow (BM) provides a homing microenvironment, which is important for tumor development, growth, proliferation, migration and chemoresistance. Our previous research has shown that macrophages (M\u03a6) are associated with malignant BM and confer MM cell chemoresistance in vitro. Based on these findings, we designed mechanistic studies to elucidate M\u03a6-mediated MM chemoresistance. M\u03a6 protected MM cells from different chemotherapeutics, such as bortezomib, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, melphalan, or their combination-induced apoptosis. Cell-to-cell contact was crucial for such protection. Under a coculture condition, M\u03a6 protected MM cells with wide ranging MM/M\u03a6 ratio. Inhibition of phagocytosis did not affect the protection. An experiment examining MM patients' BM showed that M\u03a6 was a dominant accessory cell population in patients' BM. Patients PBMC-derived M\u03a6 or primary M\u03a6 isolated from patient BM had protective activity. Further mechanistic study showed that surface molecules, such as P/E selectins (on M\u03a6) and their ligand PSGL-1 (on MM cells), were important for M\u03a6-mediated MM chemoresistance. Blockade antibodies against either P/E selectins or PSGL-1 significantly repressed M\u03a6-mediated drug resistance. M\u03a6 had limited protection on PSGL-1-knocked down MM cells. Next, we examined intracellular signal transduction in MM cells, upon interaction with M\u03a6s. Src family kinase and Erk1/2 kinase were activated in MM cells, after coculture with M\u03a6s. Coculture also stimulated PSGL-1 and c-myc overexpression in MM cells. Inhibition of Src family kinase, Erk1/2 kinase, or c-myc by small molecule inhibitors impaired M\u03a6-mediated MM chemoresistance. The overexpression of PSGL-1, under coculture condition, could be repressed by IFN-\u03b1 neutralization antibody. More importantly, coculture with M\u03a6 could not stimulate Erk1/2 activation or c-myc overexpression in PSGL-1-knocked down MM cells, suggesting that Erk1/2 and c-myc were downstream of PSGL-1-initiated signal transduction. Finally, we established a NOD-SCID mouse model to test M\u03a6-mediated MM chemoresistance in vivo. MM tumors with M\u03a6 infiltration grew significantly faster than MM, only, tumors and were more resistant to melphalan treatment. Overall, our data demonstrated a mechanism of M\u03a6-mediated chemoresistance, both in vitro and in vivo. Based on our findings, M\u03a6-targeted therapy in MM treatment may be beneficial to improve the effectiveness of MM chemotherapy. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
