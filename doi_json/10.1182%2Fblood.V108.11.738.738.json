    "abstract_text": "We have shown that IC50 is predictive of molecular response in newly diagnosed CML patients treated with 600mg of imatinib (TIDEL). OCT-1 is an influx transporter for imatinib and key determinant of interpatient variation in the IC50 assay. Using 14 C imatinib we have performed an intracellular uptake and retention (IUR) assay and RQ-PCR for OCT-1 mRNA expression on blood cells from 42 patients at diagnosis, enrolled to TIDEL. Using the OCT-1 inhibitor Prazosin, we determined OCT-1 in-vitro activity to be the difference in IUR between assays performed with and without Prazosin. The median OCT-1 activity was 6.1ng (range of -3.6 to 27ng). Grouping patients about the median, into low and high OCT-1activity, we found a significant difference between the two groups in molecular response.

There was a significant difference in molecular response between the low and high OCT-1 activity groups on <600 mg ( p=0.004 at 24 months) but no difference in the 600mg cohort, further indicating dose sensitivity of low OCT-1 activity patients. The level of OCT-1 mRNA (n=30) as determined by RQ-PCR correlated with the in-vitro OCT-1 activity ( r=0.381 p=0.04 ). However, in this smaller cohort, OCT-1 mRNA level was not predictive of molecular response (low OCT-1 3.5 log(n=15); high OCT-1 3.9 log(n=16) p=0.169 ). The IC50 is predictive of molecular response to 12 months (low IC50 log reduction 3.0 (n=20) high IC50 2.5 (n=15) p=0.02 ), but not in this smaller cohort to 24 months ( p=0.15 ). TIDEL mandated dose increase to 800mg where tolerable. We assessed the log reduction from 12 to 24 months based on dose. Log reduction from 12 to 24 months.  Dose increase . Yes . No . p value .

We conclude that OCT-1 influx activity is an important determinant of molecular response to imatinib, but its predictive value is closely linked to the dose received. This functional assay of OCT-1 activity performed at diagnosis may identify patients most likely to benefit from higher doses of imatinib or second generation ABL kinase inhibitors, and a cohort who are likely to respond well to standard dose imatinib.",
