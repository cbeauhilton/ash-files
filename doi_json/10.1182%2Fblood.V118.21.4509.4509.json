    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4509 BACKGROUND: Once multiple myeloma (MM) relapses after a first autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), long-term disease control is challenging because of limited therapeutic options. A second autologous HSCT is one of the options although the choice of conditioning regimens has not been thoroughly investigated. Past studies demonstrated that adding oral busulfan (Bu) to melphalan for conditioning regimen prior to a first HSCT resulted in better disease control of MM than melphalan single administration [Lahuerta et al, Haematologica. 2010;95:1913]. Nonetheless, the risk of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) hinders the use of oral Bu as a part of the conditioning regimen. Intravenous (IV) Bu eliminates the unpredictable bioavailability of the oral drug, whereas pharmacokinetic (PK)-directed dose optimization reduces inter-individual variability in the metabolism of Bu, resulting in decreased incidence of VOD and improvement in the control of hematologic malignancies [Andersson et al, Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 2002;8:477]. In addition, a proteasome inhibitor like bortezomib may have synergy with an alkylating agent for conditioning prior to HSCT in myeloma [Lonial et al, Clin Cancer Res 2010; 16: 5079], but the safety of a combination with Bu has not been investigated to date. Here we report results from a multicenter, prospective Phase 2 study to examine the pharmacokinetics of IV Bu and safety with bortezomib as a conditioning regimen for a second autologous HSCT. METHODS: 30 patients with relapsed MM who had a first autologous HSCT \u22651 year prior to the planned HSCT were enrolled from eleven centers in the US and Canada. Patients received a test dose of IV Bu (0.8 mg/kg) over 2 hours between days 12 and 9 prior to HSCT. Serial blood samples were drawn up to 360 min after the start of the infusion. A central laboratory measured Bu concentrations, determined Bu exposure as area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) using WinNonlin software, and recommended individualized PK-directed dosing in order to achieve a total regimen AUC of 20,000 \u03bcM\u00b7min. Using the patient-specific PK-directed dose, IV Bu was administered over 3 hours once daily from Day -5 to Day -2. In all patients, a second PK analysis was conducted on Day -5 to confirm the PK-directed dose. Bu doses were adjusted on Day -3 and Day -2, if needed. Bortezomib (1.3 mg/m 2 QD) was administered as an IV bolus injection on Day -1. RESULTS: All 30 patients who enrolled in this study had been treated with high dose melphalan before a first HSCT. The median time from the first to second HSCT was 31.4 months (range 12.0 \u2013 119.2 months). Disease status prior to the second HSCT was VGPR (n=6), PR (n=12), SD (n=2), and PD (n=10). Test PK revealed that 40.0 % (n=12/30) of the patients had doses outside of target range (1,250 \u03bcM\u00b7min +/\u2212 20%), based on expected exposure using a fixed dose of 0.8 mg/kg. Specifically, infusion of the test dose resulted in 1,500 \u03bcM\u00b7min or higher AUC in 3.3% (n=1/30) and 1,000 \u03bcM\u00b7min or lower AUC in 36.7% (n=11/30) of patients. In order to achieve the target AUC, daily PK-directed dose of IV Bu when conditioning started on Day -5 ranged between 1.99 mg/kg and 4.73 mg/kg: lower than 3.2 mg/kg in 12 subjects and higher than 3.2 mg/kg in the remaining 18. Confirmatory PK on Day -5 demonstrated that mean Bu clearances were comparable to that from test PK: 3.03 ml/min/kg for test dose and 2.93 ml/min/kg for Day - 5. Consequently, using a test dose followed by PK-directed Bu dosing, 93.3% of patients (n=28/30) fell within the target range (AUC, 20,000 \u03bcM\u00b7min +/\u221220%). Only two patients (6.7%) needed subsequent daily dose adjustment on Day -3 and Day -2. No instances of VOD, seizure, or worsening neuropathy have been reported to date. One death was reported by Day 30 after transplant in a patient with Parkinsonism who died of pulmonary complications. CONCLUSION: This multicenter, prospective study reveals that a pre-transplant test dose PK allows accurate targeting of busulfan dosing. The conditioning regimen of bortezomib and IV busulfan with PK-directed dose optimization is well tolerated in patients with relapsed MM who undergo second autologous HSCT.
