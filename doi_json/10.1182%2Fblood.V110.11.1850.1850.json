    "abstract_text": "AVE9633/huMy9-6-DM4 is an immunoconjugate composed of a humanized monoclonal IgG 1 antibody, huMy9-6, which specifically targets the CD33 antigen, conjugated through a disulfide link to the maytansine derivative DM4, a potent tubulin inhibitor. The CD33 antigen is expressed on the surface of myeloid cells. After the conjugate is bound to the CD33 antigen it is internalized and the cytotoxic is released within the target cell. We report preliminary results of the ongoing phase I dose escalation study of AVE9633 in patients with refractory/relapsed CD33+ AML. The study regimen consists of AVE9633 IV infusion on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 28-day cycle. To date, dose levels of 30 (n=1), 50 (n=3), 75 (n=3), 105 (n=3) and 130 (n=3) mg/m 2 on Day 1 and Day 8 have been investigated. Patients received 1 (n=2), 2 (n=5), 3 (n=2) and 4 (n=4) cycles of AVE9633. No dose-limiting toxicity was noted so far. Nine patients experienced mild to moderate infusion reactions, mostly on Day1 of Cycle1. One patient at 130 mg/m 2 presented grade 3 ALT elevation of 3 days duration. Free DM4, measured by LC/MS/MS was detectable at 105 and 130 mg/m 2 in the range of 5 to 10 ng/mL. AVE9633/huMy9-6-DM4 exposure (measuring, by ELISA method, all antibodies containing at least one molecule of DM4) increased proportionally with the administered dose. Using Flow Cytometry Assay, saturation and down regulation of CD33 on peripheral and marrow blasts were observed from the dose of 50 mg/m 2 . There was one CRp in a 68-year old woman with refractory AML, achieved after 4 cycles of AVE9633 given at 105 mg/m 2 \u00d7 2, with a 4-month continuing CRp as of 7/07 (she is receiving AVE9633 105 mg/m 2 once monthly). One PR occurred in a 81-year old woman with refractory AML after one cycle at 130 mg/m 2 \u00d7 2, persistent after the second cycle (third cycle is ongoing). Two patients had >50% decrease in bone marrow blasts, at 105 mg/m 2 \u00d7 2 (from 25% to 8% after two cycles) and at 130 mg/m 2 \u00d7 2 (from 35% to 9% after one cycle). One additional patient at 75 mg/m 2 \u00d7 2 presented clearance of peripheral blasts by Day 10 of Cycle1. Mean DM4/IgG on the surface of peripheral blasts (available for one patient at 130 mg/m 2 ) progressively decreased after the infusion, from 3.09 on day 1 to 0.28 on Day 8, and then increased to 2.64 after the second infusion of AVE9633 on Day 8. These preliminary results show that AVE9633 is well tolerated, with manageable safety profile, allowing outpatient treatment. Evidence of anti-leukemia activity was observed in 5 patients. The study is continuing with the evaluation of 150 mg/m 2 \u00d7 2. Evaluation of closer drug administrations which might enhance efficacy appears warranted."
