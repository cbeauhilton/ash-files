    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1202 Objective: Curcumin (diferuloyl methane), an active component of the spice turmeric, has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities in addition to an anticartinogenic activity in vitro and in vivo . Furthermore, we reported that curcumin inhibited the induction of tissue factor (TF) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at 52nd ASH 2010. Therefore, curcumin may ameliorate hyper-coagulable state associated with inflammation or oxidative stress. On the other hand, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) which is expressed by endothelial cells plays a crucial role in hemostasis by regulating TF-induced initiation of coagulation. This study examined whether curcumin modulates the expression of TFPI in HUVECs. Methods: HUVECs were pretreated with curcumin at the concentration of 20 \u03bcM for 3h, washed and stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha, 10 ng/ml) for additional 12 or 24h. The mRNA and protein levels of TFPI in the cultured HUVECs were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting, respectively. To determine whether curcumin affects the MAPK signaling pathways, the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the HUVECs were analyzed with western blotting. Additionally, to determine whether curcumin affects nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathway, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were extracted and protein levels were determined by western blotting for NF- k B (p65), p-IkB and I k B. Results: After TNF-alpha stimulation, TFPI mRNA levels were approximately decreased by 40% compared to the control (p<0.05; Figure 1 B). Similarly to the mRNA expression, TFPI protein levels were decreased ( Figure 1 A). On the other hand, pretreatment of HUVECs with curcumin significantly suppresses TNF-alpha-induced TFPI mRNA and protein down-regulation (p<0.05; Figure 1 A, B). Curcumin inhibited TNF-alpha-induced activation of p38MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK. Moreover, curcumin inhibits TNF-alpha-induced IkB activation in HUVECs. And, translocation of NF- k B from the cytosol into the nucleus by TNF-alpha was inhibited by curcumin. Conclusions: These results indicate that curcumin may suppress the TNF-alpha-induced TFPI down-regulation via NF- k B pathways. Thus, curcumin may offer a novel antithrombotic option for treatment of the hypercoagulable state associated with inflammation.
