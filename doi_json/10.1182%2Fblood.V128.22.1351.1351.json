    "abstract_text": "Activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a critical component of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone (ALDO)-System (RAAS), has been shown to play an important role in inflammatory and vascular endothelial responses in addition to its well-described effects on sodium and water homeostasis . Activationof endothelial cells leads to, among other factors, increased endothelin-1 (ET-1) and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) release. PDI and ET-1 contribute to vascular inflammation and are increased in patients with SCD and sickle transgenic mouse models. The MR is a member of the steroid family of nuclear receptors and transcription factors that upon activation binds to hormone response elements of edn1 , the gene for ET-1, leading to increased ET-1 expression. In vivo , blockade of MR has been shown to reduce circulating ET-1 levels and ET-1 mRNA expression. However, the role of MR in SCD is unclear. We hypothesized that MR blockade in sickle transgenic mice would reduce PDI activity and improve hematological parameters and inflammation. We first studied EA.hy926 (EA) cells, a human endothelial cell line that expresses MR. We incubated EA cells with ALDO (10 -8 M), an MR agonist, for 24 hr and observed a rise in PDI mRNA levels by qRT-PCR ( P <0.01, n=5), an event that was blocked by pre-incubation of EA cells with 1 \u03bcM canrenoic acid (CA), an MR antagonist ( P <0.05, n=5). We then measured PDI activity in the supernatant of ALDO-stimulated EA cells using a Di-E-GSSH fluorescent marker and observed a rise in PDI activity following ALDO (10 -8 M) when compared to vehicle treatment ( P <0.05; n=5). To test the in vivo effects of MR activation, we studied Berkeley Sickle Transgenic (BERK) mice that were randomized to receive either normal rodent chow or chow containing eplerenone (156 mg/kg per day), an MR antagonist (MRA), for 14 days. We observed significantly lower plasma PDI activity in mice treated with MRA than those on regular chow (63.7 \u00b1 8.7 control diet to 47.9 \u00b1 2.4 eplerenone, Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU); P<0.005, n=6 and 9, respectively). Treatment with MRA was associated with reduced plasma ET-1 and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in BERK mice. We also studied RBC Gardos channel activity in these mice and observed a significant reduction in clotrimazole-sensitive K + efflux following MR blockade (2.49\u00b10.5 control and 1.37\u00b10.3 mmol/10 13 cells x hr; P<0.04 n= 5 and 7 respectively). Consistent with these results, MR blockade was associated with increases in both erythrocyte MCV (41.3\u00b12.5 vs 47.4\u00b11.1 fL, P<0.03, n=7) and reticulocyte MCV (53.6.3\u00b12.8 vs 60.1\u00b10.6 fL, P<0.02, n=7). We also studied gene expression by qRT-PCR in heart tissue from these mice and observed that MR blockade reduced mRNA expression of: ET-1 (0.654 \u00b1 0.233, P<0.05, n=5 and n=7); PDI (0.546 \u00b1 0.063, P<0.01, n=5 and n=7); and Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 1A mRNA (0.464 \u00b1 0.061, P<0.01, n=5 and n=7). Thus, our results suggest a novel role for RAAS and, in particular, MR activation in SCD. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
