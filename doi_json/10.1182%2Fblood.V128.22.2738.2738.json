    "abstract_text": "Background & Hypothesis: IFITM3 (Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3) was identified as interferon-inducible molecule in the context of viral infection. Endosomal membrane localized IFITM3 appear to prevent fusion events of intraluminal viral particles to the endosomal membrane through accumulation of cholesterol which makes membrane more rigid. We recently found that IFITM3 is a dual-pass transmembrane protein expressed on B cell lineage ALL cells. Thereby IFITM3 is associated with known B cell co-receptors including CD19, CD81 and CD21. While the significance of this association was unknown, we found that IFITM3 is required for surface expression of the B cell antigen CD19. Although immunotherapy approaches based on CD19-specific engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CART19) have achieved spectacular successes in eliminating pre-B ALL cells based on surface expression of CD19 (Grupp et al., 2013), in some cases, CD19-specific engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CART19) treatment was followed by ALL relapse developing from clones that lacked CD19 surface expression. Results: Studying IFITM3 mRNA levels in B cell lineage ALL cells at the time of diagnosis in clinical trials for childhood (COG P9906) and adult ALL (ECOG E2993), we found that higher than median expression levels of IFITM3 predicted shorter overall and relapse-free survival (P=0.014). In addition, higher than median IFITM3 mRNA levels at the time of diagnosis were associated with a higher risk of ALL relapse and positive MRD status at the end of induction chemotherapy. To study the function of Ifitm3 in a model for human pre-B ALL, pre-B cells from Ifitm3 -/- mice were transformed with BCR-ABL1 or oncogenic NRAS. Strikingly, deletion of IFITM3 resulted in loss of CD19 expression on the surface of normal and leukemic pre-B cells. Besides loss of surface expression, loss of Ifitm3 also caused impaired phosphorylation of CD19-Y513, which mediates downstream activation of PI3K signaling in both normal and malignant B cells. These changes were paralleled by G0/1 cell cycle arrest (P<0.001), loss of colony formation capacity (P=0.0004) and increased propensity to apoptosis. In vivo transplant setting, Ifitm3 -/- pre-B ALL cells failed to initiate fetal leukemia in transplant-recipient mice. In mechanistic study, we identified type II transmembrane topology for IFITM3 at plasma membrane with extracellular C and intracellular N terminus which interacted with CD19, LYN, SYK, PI3K and AKT. Disruption of endocytic motif ( 20 YEML 23 ) by substitution of Tyr 20 to Phe caused accumulation of IFITM3 at plasma membrane and led to constitutive activation of CD19/PI3K-AKT signaling. In addition to the gain-of-function mutants, extracellularly exposed C terminus was further stimulated by agonistic antibodies against IFITM3, which triggers CD19/PI3K-AKT signaling, intracellular calcium mobilization, homotypic cellular aggregation and massively increased proliferation of pre-B ALL cells. Through Filipin based cholesterol staining, we found Ifitm3 -/- pre-B cells have low levels of cholesterol at plasma membrane, which causes disruption of lipid rafts formation with decreased levels of ganglioside G M1 . Thereby, Inadequate CD19/BCR co-receptor signaling caused by disruption of lipid rafts homeostasis by Ifitm3 deficiency results in critical developmental defects of peritoneal B1 cell compartment in vivo . Conclusion: These findings identify novel role of the IFITM3 surface receptor maintaining lipid rafts and CD19 surface expression. IFITM3-dependent lipid raft stability and CD19 surface expression were essential for normal and oncogenic PI3K signaling. IFITM3 is a central mediator of CD19 surface trafficking and mediates the proliferation and survival signaling via PI3K in normal pre-B cells and various subtypes of human pre-B ALL.
