    "abstract_text": "Abstract 551 Normal hematopoiesis is maintained by long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) that are defined by their extensive self-renewal and multipotency. Self-renewal of LT-HSCs in turn is regulated by a complex network of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The transcription factor MEIS1 is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and also in several leukemias, suggesting that MEIS1 might be important in regulating self-renewal. However, the role of MEIS1 in normal hematopoiesis has not been defined. To determine the role of MEIS1 in hematopoiesis, we studied conditional knockout mice. We generated transgenic mice bearing loxp sites flanking the homeodomain of MEIS1. The MEIS1-floxed mice were then bred to Rosa26-CreERT2 mice, the latter expressing cre-recombinase ubiquitously, that can be activated by estrogen or its analog Tamoxifen (Tam). Efficient, complete recombination was achieved in vivo by treating MEIS1-f/f-Cre (homozygous for MEIS1-flox) mice with Tam and in vitro by treating bone marrow cells with 4-hydroxy tamoxifen. Loss of MEIS1 expression was detected by QRT-PCR and western blotting. To determine the role of MEIS1 in the maintenance of adult hematopoiesis, MEIS1-f/f-Cre and control mice were treated with Tam and MEIS1 deletion confirmed by PCR. At three weeks post deletion, bone marrow analysis showed a significant reduction in the number of LT-HSCs defined as lin-/c-Kit+/Sca1+/CD48\u2212/CD150+ in the MEIS1-depleted mice compared to controls (0.012% compared to 0.037%, N=6, p<0.05, t-test). However, the progenitor populations were unaffected by MEIS1 deletion. Over a period of 12 weeks of observation, the mice did not show any signs of distress and the peripheral blood counts of the experimental and control mice remained normal, indicating that short term hematopoiesis was not affected. Cell cycle analysis of LT-HSCs showed that MEIS1 deletion resulted in a significant shift of cells from G0 to G1 phase (G0 and G1 proportions respectively, 81.75\u00b13.25% and 9.40\u00b13% for control and 56.10\u00b10.873% and 31.17\u00b11.5% for MEIS1-deleted). To determine the effects of MEIS1 loss on intrinsic hematopoietic stem cell function, we performed competitive repopulation assays. Bone marrow cells harvested from MEIS1-f/f-Cre or MEIS1-f/+-Cre (control) mice were combined with equal numbers of bone marrow cells from BoyJ mice and transplanted via tail vein injection into lethally irradiated BoyJ mice. Four weeks after transplant, recipients were treated with Tam or vehicle for 5 days and deletion of MEIS1 confirmed by PCR on peripheral blood. Peripheral blood of recipient mice was analyzed at 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after treatment and relative chimerism assessed by flow cytometry. At 1 and 4 weeks after treatment, the chimerism in the MEIS1 deleted group (Tam treated MEIS1-f/f-CreER) and the control groups (Tam treated MEIS1-f/+-CReER and vehicle treated MEIS1-f/f-CreER) was comparable (41%, 40.5% and 41.5% respectively, average, N=5 to 8). However, by 8 weeks after treatment, the MEIS1 deleted group showed a significant decline in chimerism compared to controls (18.2% compared to 43.1% and 35.1% respectively, p<0.02, t-test) and at 16 weeks the chimerism in the MEIS1-deleted group declined further (11.1% compared to 40.2% and 35.0% respectively, p<0.001). Subpopulation analysis showed loss of chimerism in granulocytes and in B and T lymphocytes. The latency and breadth of the effect of MEIS1 loss suggested an effect on the hematopoietic stem cell population. Indeed, bone marrow analysis of transplant recipients showed near complete loss of LT-HSC chimerism (3% compared to 70.25% and 75.6% respectively, p<0.001). Finally, we performed gene expression profiling on lineage negative bone marrow cells with and without MEIS1 deletion. Results showed that loss of MEIS1 was associated with decreased expression of hypoxia-responsive genes. Collectively, these results indicate that MEIS1 is required for the maintenance of the pool of LT-HSCs. Loss of MEIS1 promotes cycling and exhaustion of LT-HSCs. Further, we propose that activation of the hypoxia-response pathway may be one of the mechanisms by which MEIS1 exerts its effects on hematopoietic stem cells.
