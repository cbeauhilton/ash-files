    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2915 Bortezomib is a reversible first-generation proteasome inhibitor that inhibits the \u03b25 and to a lesser extent the \u03b21 catalytic site of the proteasome. However, bortezomib does not inhibit the \u03b22 catalytic proteasomal site at clinically relevant concentrations, and bortezomib-resistance is accompanied by upregulation of the \u03b22 subunit, suggesting that increased \u03b22 activity may compensate for the loss of \u03b21/ \u03b25 activity during bortezomib-treatment. The second generation proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib, due to the chemistry of its epoxyketone warhead, has a higher substrate specificity and functions as an irreversible proteasome inhibitor, but is still a \u03b21/ \u03b25 inhibitor that does not affect the \u03b22 active site. We investigated the effect of \u03b22-specific proteasome inhibition on myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and tested the hypothesis that \u03b22-selective proteasome inhibition may overcome bortezomib-resistance. To this end we have developed a set of epoxyketone- and vinylsulfone-based, cell permeable proteasome inhibitors of which we selected the compounds PR523A and PR671A for further testing in cell-based assays. PR671A is a peptide-vinylsulfone that selectively inhibits the proteasome's \u03b22/ \u03b22i subunit in an irreversible fashion in human cell lines and primary cells at low micromolar concentrations without inhibition of other protease species. PR523A is a \u03b25-selective peptide-epoxyketone with otherwise similar properties. Treatment of myeloma and AML cell lines (AMO-1, U-266, HL-60, THP-1) with PR523A induced ER-stress mediated apoptosis, very similar to bortezomib. The combination of bortezomib with PR523A led to additive, but not synergistic induction of apoptosis, as expected. Selective \u03b22 inhibition by PR671A resulted in the induction of ER stress and the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated protein, however, this was not effectively translated into apoptotic cell death. This indicates that selective inhibition of the \u03b22 proteasome subunit alone has only a poor cytotoxic effect on myeloma and AML cell lines, suggesting that the function of \u03b22 is largely redundant and can be compensated when the remaining proteasome catalytic subunits (\u03b21 and \u03b25) remain active. However, when the \u03b22 inhibitor PR671A was combined with agents that target the proteasome's \u03b25 active site (PR523A) or the \u03b25 and the \u03b21 site (bortezomib), the combination of either inhibitor with the \u03b22 inhibitor PR671A was highly synergistic for both activation of ER stress and the induction of apoptotic death. Importantly, the bortezomib-resistance in bortezomib-adapted myeloma and AML cell lines could be overcome by combining PR671A with either bortezomib or PR523A, while \u03b22 inhibition by PR671A alone had no effect on the viability of bortezomib-adapted cells. We conclude that PR671A is a \u03b22 selective proteasome inhibitor. Selective Inhibition of the proteasome's \u03b22 subunit has little effect on viability or ER stress both in normal and bortezomib-resistant myeloma and leukemia cells, suggesting that the function of the \u03b22 catalytic site is largely redundant. However, when \u03b21/ \u03b25 proteasome activity is inhibited by drugs like bortezomib or carfilzomib, proper function of the \u03b22 proteasome active site is crucial for cell survival, also in bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells. The use of specific \u03b22 inhibitors like PR671A in combination with \u03b21/ \u03b25 inhibitors like bortezomib or carfilzomib is therefore a promising strategy to overcome resistance against \u03b21/ \u03b25-selective proteasome inhibitors.
