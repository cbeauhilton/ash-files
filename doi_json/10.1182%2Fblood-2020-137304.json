    "abstract_text": "Background . The majority of PV patients are iron deficient at diagnosis [Ginzburg Leukemia 2018]. PV patients are treated with periodic therapeutic phlebotomy (TP) in order to maintain hematocrit levels 70% within 12 hours and the effect persists for 3-7 days. In a phase 2 trial in \u03b2-thalassemia, PTG-300 also decreased serum iron and TSAT but did not demonstrate off-target effects. The current study aims to compare the iron status in frequent TP-requiring PV patients before, during, and after treatment with PTG-300. Methods . Polycythemia patients who met 2016 WHO criteria for diagnosis were enrolled in the 28-week dose finding part of a Phase 2 trial. All patients required \u22653 phlebotomies with or without concurrent cytoreductive therapy over 6 months prior to enrollment. Patients were given PTG-300 doses of 10, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg administered subcutaneously weekly in individualized adjustment to maintain hematocrit <45%. Body iron status was quantified by monitoring serum ferritin, serum iron, transferrin saturation (TSAT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). Results . Thirteen subjects were enrolled to date: 7/13 with low risk, mean age 57.4 years (range 31-74). Six receiving TP alone, 6 on concurrent hydroxyurea, 1 on concurrent interferon; TP in the 24 weeks prior to enrollment = 3-9; median time between TP = 42 days. All subjects-maintained hematocrit <45% after appropriate dose adjustment. Mean baseline values were serum ferritin = 14.2 ng/mL (5, 37); serum iron = 33.0 ug/dL (16.8, 107.8); and TSAT = 7.6% (4, 30). During treatment with PTG-300, serum ferritin levels increased progressively toward normal ( Figure 1a ) reflecting increase in iron stores. TSAT ( Figure 1b ) and serum iron values increased modestly but remained below normal ranges, reflecting PTG-300's pharmacodynamic effect of inhibiting iron release from intracellular stores. This was associated with increased MCV ( Figure 1c ) and MCH ( Figure 1d ) and decreased hematocrit and erythrocyte counts, together suggesting a normalization of iron distribution. Conclusions . The current results indicate that PTG-300 is an effective agent for the controlling hematocrit and reversing iron deficiency. The effect of PTG-300 on PV-related symptoms and those of iron deficiency, are also being evaluated. Continued patient enrollment will enable more definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of hepcidin mimetic PTG-300 in PV patients with high TP requirements.
