    "abstract_text": "The clinical course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is variable. DNA-microarray studies have shown that the gene-expression patterns of CLL cells with unmutated IgVH genes are similar to those of cells with mutated IgVH genes, but that the patterns of both are distinct from those of other leukemias and lymphomas. Nevertheless, the two subtypes of CLL can be distinguished by the differential expression of a small number of genes, one of which encodes ZAP-70, an intracellular tyrosine kinase with a critical role in T-cell receptor signaling. Further analysis of the mutation status of IgVH genes and ZAP-70 expression revealed that CLL patients with B cells expressing ZAP-70 and unmutated IgVH genes had a more aggressive disease. LAG-3 (CD223) is thought to play a role in immune responses mediated by T and NK cells. LAG-3, a CD4 homolog, is a ligand for MHC class II antigens. Similar to ZAP-70, LAG-3 is selectively expressed on activated T and NK cells and has recently been shown to be expressed on T-cell activated B cells. We compared the gene expression profiles of the B cells purified from 15 CLL patients using the Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0. This analysis revealed LAG-3 and parathymosin differentially expressed at higher levels by the CLL cells expressing ZAP-70 and unmutated IgVH genes. LAG-3 and parathymosin are located on chromosome 12p13 with head-to-tail orientation. To examine for surface expression of LAG-3, we performed flow cytometry on these same 15 CLL samples using an anti LAG-3 mAb (CD223). We found LAG-3 expressed at high levels by the CD5/CD19 B cells of 4/8 (50%) cases that expressed ZAP-70 and unmutated IgVH genes. Conversely, the samples with B cells lacking ZAP-70 and with mutated IgVH genes did not express LAG-3 (0/7). All samples (15/15) expressed high level of MHC class II antigens, as assessed by flow cytometry. LAG-3 may interact with MHC class II molecules expressed by CLL cells to form an autocrine loop that may further enhance the activation of ZAP-70-expressing CLL B cells. Further analysis is needed to delineate the role of LAG-3 in the pathogenesis and/or progression of this disease.",
