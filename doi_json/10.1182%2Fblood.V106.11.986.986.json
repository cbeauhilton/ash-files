    "abstract_text": "Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is an effective alternative for the analysis of cytogenetic abnormalities of low proliferative entities such as Waldenstro\u0308m macroglobulinemia (WM) but, to date, no studies have been carried out to explore the potential impact of molecular cytogenetics on disease evolution. Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q-) is the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality in WM. In this study we have analyzed the incidence of this aberration (using both conventional cytogenetics and FISH analysis) in 102 WM patients, and we have correlated it with disease characteristics. Deletion of 6q21 was detected in 6% of patients by conventional cytogenetics, while FISH studies increased this incidence up to 39%. Moreover, in those patients analyzed by cIgM-FISH, the incidence of 6q- was higher (54%). Interestingly, 6q- patients displayed features associated with adverse prognosis (higher levels of ESR, CRP and beta-2 microglobulin), and a greater tendency to display anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Other differentiating variables without reaching statistical significance were a tendency of displaying a higher bone marrow lymphoplasmacytoid infiltration and the amount of monoclonal component in 6q- patients (table). In addition, patients with 6q- displayed shorter survival from time of diagnose (log-rank; p =0.09). In summary, our results show that 6q deletion in WM patients is currently the most frequently found cytogenetic abnormality. Patients with this deletion also shows a trend towards an aggressive disease and poorer outcome in WM. Further studies should focus on possible tumor suppressor genes in the minimal area of deletion at 6q and to determine their role in disease progression. table  . del6q present . del6q absent . p-value . n  40 (39%) 62 (61%)  \u03b22M \u22654mg/dL 48% 16% 0.005 CRP \u22653.5 mg/dL 47% 11% 0.006 Albumin <4mg/dL 86% 55% 0.006 ESR \u2265100 mm/h 73% 44% 0.02 Hb <11 g/dL 63% 40% 0.02 serum IgM >20 g/L 86% 73% 0.10 BM infiltration >40% 44% 31% 0.20 . del6q present . del6q absent . p-value . n  40 (39%) 62 (61%)  \u03b22M \u22654mg/dL 48% 16% 0.005 CRP \u22653.5 mg/dL 47% 11% 0.006 Albumin <4mg/dL 86% 55% 0.006 ESR \u2265100 mm/h 73% 44% 0.02 Hb <11 g/dL 63% 40% 0.02 serum IgM >20 g/L 86% 73% 0.10 BM infiltration >40% 44% 31% 0.20 View Large",
