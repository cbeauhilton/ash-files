    "abstract_text": "Background : MPNs including Polycythemia Vera (PV), Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF), are clonal hematopoietic diseases in which the discovery of molecular driver mutations (JAK2, CALR, MPL) has deeply modified diagnostic approach in recent years. To date available data on epidemiology of MPNs and perspective analysis are rare. Our aim is to study the incidence of MPN Ph negative in a specific region of Italy named Latium and its variability across five years. Moreover we prospectively report the general features of our population. Method : We present here the prospective epidemiologic analysis of 1116 adult patients affected by MPNs (PV=289, ET=550, PMF=209) diagnosed according to 2008 WHO criteria, from January 2011 to December 2015 in 15 hematological Centers (5 academic and 10 community-based Hospitals) in Latium. A total of 289 PV, 550 ET and 209PMF were identified. The overall incidence rate of 289PV was 1.0/10 5 in 2011 and 2012, 1.1/10 5 in 2013, 0.9/10 5 in 2014 and 2015. The overall incidence rate of 550ET was 2.0/10 5 in 2011, 2.4/10 5 in 2012, 2.2/10 5 in 2013, 1.8/10 5 in 2014 and 1,2/10 5 in 2015 and the overall incidence rate of 209PMF was 0.7/10 5 in 2011 and 2012, 1.0/10 5 in 2013, 0.7/10 5 in 2014 and 0.5/10 5 in 2015. We have observed also 63 cases of MPNu (36M/32F) and the incidence rate was 0.3/10 5 in 2011 and 2012, 0.14/10 5 in 2013, 0.24/10 5 in 2014 and 0.22/10 5 in 2015. Baseline features of PV, ET and PMF patients are summarized in table 1. We have also analyzed the presence of comorbidities including obesity, arhythmia and neoplasia observed at the diagnosis in 1.6, 6.2 and 4% of all population, respectively; thirty-five percent of 1116 pts presented other comorbidities such as diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, renal and liver failure. As thrombotic risk factors we considered diabetes, dislipidemia, smoke, essential hypertension and thrombophilia observed in 11,8, 16,2, 13,2, 51,7 and 3% of total pts, respectively. Conclusions: We confirm in our prospective observational protocol the overall incidence of MPN Ph negative, previously reported in the literature and the major incidence of male gender in PV and PMF, female in of ET. The annual incidence from 2011-2015 in Latium is remained substantially the same during the observation period. The decreasing trend observed in 2015 is probably due to the different update of some Centers that was done in October 2015 not including patients diagnosed in the last two months.
