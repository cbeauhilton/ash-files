    "abstract_text": "Introduction: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy accounting for 15% of pediatric and 25% of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases. With current chemotherapies and transplantation therapy, there are still 25-50% T-ALL patients that suffer from relapse and have a poor outcome. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs (containing about 22 nucleotides in length). miRs function at posttranscriptional level as negative regulators of gene expression and exert their regulatory function through binding to target mRNAs and silencing gene expression. To better understand the pathogenesis and develop the new therapeutic targets of T-ALL, we have developed a Pten tumor suppressor knockout T-ALL mouse model and profiled miRs from the mouse Pten deficient T-ALL. miR-26b was one of the miRs that were found down-regulated in the mouse Pten deficient T-ALL. Recent studies showed that the aberrant expression of miR-26b is implicated in several types of cancer. The expression level of miR-26b and its role of in T-ALL, however, are unknown. We investigated if the expression level of miR-26b is aberrant in T-ALL and the effect of potentially altered expression on the growth of human T-ALL cells. Methods: We conducted miR array profiling to identify differentially expressed miRs in the mouse Pten deficient T-ALLs compared with preneoplastic thymocyte controls. We validated expression levels of several miRs, including miR-26b, that are differentially expressed in mouse and human T-ALL cells using quantitative RT-PCR. We also overexpressed miR-26b using a lentivirus based vector in human T-ALL cell lines to assess its effect on cell growth and apoptosis. Results: Employing miR array profiling, we identified a subset of miRs that exhibited marked altered expression in the mouse Pten deficient T-ALL cells. Quantitative RT-PCR validated that the expression level of miR-26b in the mouse Pten deficient T-ALL cells was markedly lower in comparison to that of preneoplastic thymocytes. To determine if miR-26b expression level is also altered in human T-ALL, we performed quantitative RT-PCR on a panel of human T-ALL cell lines. Indeed, the expression level of miR-26b is significantly lower in the human T-ALL cell lines when compared with that of normal thymocytes. To functionally assess if miR-26b plays a role in the cell growth of human T-ALL cells, we expressed exogenous miR-26b in a panel of human T-ALL cell lines. We demonstrated that the expression of exogenous miR-26b significantly reduced the proliferation and promoted apoptosis of several human T-ALL cell lines. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that miR-26b is down-regulated in T-ALL and the expression of exogenous miR-26b elicits deceased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis of human T-ALL. These results suggest that miR-26b may function as a tumor suppressor in the development of T-ALL and further characterization of the target and regulation of miR-26b may have therapeutic implications.
