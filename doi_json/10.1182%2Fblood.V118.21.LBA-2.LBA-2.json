    "abstract_text": "Abstract LBA-2 Background: CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs) protect cancers from the immune system. They express important functional molecules such as CTLA-4 and Ox40 on their surface. Anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) is the first drug to improve survival of refractory metastatic melanoma. Its recent approval by the FDA/EMEA inaugurates a paradigm shift in cancer therapy where the immune system is targeted rather than the tumor itself. Scientific question: Does local immunomodulation of tumor specific Tregs trigger a systemic anti-tumor immune response and cure disseminated lymphoma? Results: The Tregs that infiltrate the tumor site preferentially express CTLA4 and OX40 compared to their counterparts in the blood and other lymphoid organs, both in mice and in humans. Upon injection of low doses of anti-CTLA4 and anti-OX40 together with CpG, a TLR-9 agonist, directly into the tumor, tumor-specific Tregs are depleted from the tumor-infiltrate. This immunomodulatory combination therapy triggers an anti-tumor immune response able to cure mice with established disseminated disease. The triple combination is uniquely required as neither CpG alone nor mAbs without CpG are effective. The local Treg immunomodulation with anti-CTLA4+anti-OX40+CpG in a single sub-cutaneous tumor eradicates disease in mice with established CNS lymphoma, even with leptomeningeal and spinal cord metastases, whereas chemotherapies or mAb therapy directed against the tumor cells have little effect in the CNS site. Moreover, these cured mice have a long term intra-cranial anti-tumor immunity since they are protected against late intra-cranial re-challenge. Significance: Immunomodulatory antibodies are currently under clinical development for cancer treatment, and their major side effect is the triggering of auto-immune diseases. We show here that injecting very little doses of these antibodies in combination with CpG at one tumor site is sufficient to trigger a systemic anti-tumor response able to eradicate distant sites, including in the CNS which is usually considered a sanctuary site for conventional systemic therapies. Impact: We recently have published positive results of intra-tumoral CpG in patients with follicular Lymphoma (Brody,Levy, et al. JCO, 2010). Anti-CTLA4 has just been FDA approved in patients with metastatic melanoma, and anti-Ox40 antibodies are currently being tested in phase I/II clinical trials. Therefore, the combination described here can be tested in patients with injectable sites of lymphoma, even if they have CNS disease. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
