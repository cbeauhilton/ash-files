    "abstract_text": "Background : While several uncommon disorders (e.g., myeloproliferative diseases, connective tissue disease, etc.) have been suggested as potential risk factors for VTE, the independence and magnitude of any risk is uncertain. Objective : To test uncommon characteristics as potential independent risk factors for VTE, and estimate the magnitude of risk for each. Methods : Using the resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, we identified all incident cases of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism over the 6-year period, 1992\u20131997. For each objectively confirmed case (n=562), we identified up to two Olmsted County residents without VTE who most closely matched a case on age, gender, and medical record number (n=755). Because medical record numbers are assigned sequentially, such matching assures a similar duration of medical follow-up. For all cases and controls, we reviewed the complete medical records in the community for over 125 baseline characteristics which were tested for an association with VTE using conditional logistic regression. Results : The mean \u00b1 SD (range) ages for cases and controls were 65.71 \u00b1 18.85 (0\u2013102) and 64.90 \u00b1 18.66 (0\u2013102) years, respectively, and 55.5% were female. Novel univariate risk factors for incident VTE included former tobacco smoker, ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, chronic lung disease, all-cause pulmonary hypertension, chronic renal disease, myeloproliferative disorders, any infection, femoral artery catheterization (angiography or percutaneous intervention), ICU admission and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. Among infections, septicemia, pneumonia, and ENT, cardiovascular, GI, urinary tract and skin/soft tissue infections were univariately associated with VTE; reproductive tract infection was not. Diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, lipid-lowering drugs (including statins), inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, connective tissue disease, and influenza were not univariately associated with VTE, and beta-blocker therapy was not protective. A multivariate analysis will test these characteristics as potential independent VTE risk factors. Conclusions : Several novel characteristics are univariately associated with VTE. Such novel characteristics may provide new insights into VTE mechanisms if, upon further analysis, these characteristics are independent VTE risk factors.",
