    "abstract_text": "Inappropriate activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling confers hematopoietic progenitors the property of self-renewal that promotes malignant transformation in MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, it has been noted that activation of \u03b2-catenin is observed in tumors without clear mutations in the major components of the pathway or increase in Wnt signaling. This suggests that other developmental signaling pathways may be capable of inducing activation or downstream signaling of \u03b2-catenin. Recently, a number of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to activate \u03b2-catenin signaling to recruit the key downstream components of the canonical Wnt pathway in distinct cell types, including stem cells. GPCRs, the largest family of cell-surface molecules involved in signal transmission, have emerged as crucial players in tumor growth and metastasis, and represent one of the most important drug targets in pharmaceutical development. Given the close functional link with activation of \u03b2-catenin signaling, a GPCR signaling pathway may act as the upstream regulator of \u03b2-catenin signaling in the establishment of leukemic stem cells (LSC). In this study, our microarray analysis comparing genes differentially expressed between LSC and normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) identified GPR84, a proinflammatory GPCR, as a potential LSC-specific candidate target. An analysis of the comprehensive patient outcome database (Oncogenomics \u2013 maintained by the National Cancer Institute) showed that high levels of GPR84 were significantly associated with poor survival in patients with leukemia ( P =0.0048), implying its potential clinical relevance in predicting disease prognosis. Western blot and flow cytometric analyses confirmed the microarray results and revealed a positive correlation between GPR84 and \u03b2-catenin expression. We previously demonstrated that \u03b2-catenin was highly expressed in HSC transformed by MLL-AF9 (HSC-MLLAF9) and had lower expression in HSC transduced with leukemic oncogenes Hoxa9/Meis1 (HSC-Hoxa9/Meis1), while increased \u03b2-catenin expression was correlated with a poor survival rate in vivo. Herein, our results showed that forced expression of GPR84 induced a robust upregulation of \u03b2-catenin in HSC-Hoxa9/Meis1. Conversely, shRNA-mediated ablation of GPR84 in HSC-MLLAF9 led to highly significant downregulation of both GPR84 ( P =0.0003) and \u03b2-catenin ( P =0.0008). Further in vitro functional studies showed that GPR84 knockdown significantly reduced HSC-MLL-AF9 colony forming units ( P =0.0006), and induced a marked reduction of cells in S-phase ( P =0.0017). This deficient phenotype could be rescued by expression of a constitutively active form of \u03b2-catenin. Importantly, subsequent in vivo survival studies using leukemia transplantation mouse models showed that GPR84 knockdown significantly reduced LSC frequency and severely impaired maintenance ( P <0.0001; 11 mice per cohort) of HSC-MLL-AF9 induced leukemia, a highly aggressive and drug-resistant subtype of AML. The defect in disease phenotype resulted from inhibited expression of both GPR84 and \u03b2-catenin. Furthermore, forced overexpression of GPR84 alone was not sufficient for leukemic transformation of HSC but conferred a growth advantage in vivo to HSC-Hoxa9/Meis1 cells and significantly accelerated the onset of Hoxa9/Meis1-induced AML (P=0.0039), establishing a completely malignant phenotype similar to HSC-MLL-AF9 in vivo (P=0.9986). These data support an oncogenic role of GPR84 in MLL-AF9-induced leukemogenesis. In conclusion, our studies have identified a novel \u03b2-catenin regulator that contributes to leukemia maintenance by sustaining aberrant activation of a stem cell self-renewal pathway in LSC, and drugs targeting GPR84 may represent a novel and promising strategy for improving the therapy and outcome of AML patients.
