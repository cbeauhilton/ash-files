    "abstract_text": "CB has proven to be an acceptable alternative to BM for transplantation. However, it is unknown how CB mismatched at HLA 0\u20132 loci compares to HLA matched BM. Therefore, we compared results observed in 503 recipients of CB with those in 116 recipients of allele-matched BM (at HLA A, B, C, DRB1). Of CB recipients, 35 were matched at HLA A, B (antigen-level) and DRB1 (allele-level), 201 were mismatched at 1-locus and 267 were mismatched at 2-loci. All patients (aged 0.3 x 10 8 /kg) CB and higher in recipients of 1-locus mismatched/low cell dose (\u22640.3 x 10 8 /kg) and 2-loci mismatched CB (any cell dose) (p=0.005, p<0.001, respectively). Conversely, relapse rates were lower in recipients of CB mismatched at 1 or 2-loci (p=0.037, p=0.003, respectively). As previously observed, probability of neutrophil recovery (\u2265500/ul) at day 42 depended on graft type, HLA-match and cell dose (98% with BM; 85% with matched CB; 79% with 1 or 2-loci mismatched CB/high cell dose; 64% with 1 or 2-loci mismatched CB/low cell dose). Compared to allele-matched BM, risks of grade 2\u20134 and and grade 3\u20134 acute GVHD were lower after matched CB (relative risk [RR] 0.45, p=0.035, RR 0.51, p=0.035, respectively) and similar after mismatched CB. Risks of chronic GVHD were lower after matched or mismatched CB transplants (RR 0.66, p=0.036). The Table below shows the 5-year probabilities of TRM, relapse, LFS and OS by graft type. These results are the first to support the use of HLA matched or mismatched CB grafts with an adequate cell dose as first line transplant treatment regardless of the availability of a HLA allele-matched BM donor in the setting of actue leukemia in those <16 years.  .
