    "abstract_text": "Introduction Constitutive and immunoproteasome inhibitors (C&IPI) were thought to suppress nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway by preventing I\u03baB degradation, which prevents NF-\u03baB translocation into the nucleus. This mechanism of action has since been questioned by a number of studies. First, bortezomib promoted constitutive NF-\u03baB activity in endothelial cell carcinoma. Second, NF-\u03baB constitutive activity was resistant to bortezomib in multiple myeloma cell lines. Third, bortezomib increased I\u03baB mRNA but post-transcriptionally downregulated I\u03baB in normal cells and in multiple myeloma cell lines resulting in induced canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Lastly, bortezomib increased nuclear levels of I\u03baB as opposed to lowering cytoplasmic levels in cutaneous T cell lymphoma cell line suggesting that nuclear translocation of I\u03baB was possibly responsible for NF-\u03baB inhibition. The inhibitory activity of C&IPI on dendritic cells (DC) is of interest in the prevention of graft versus host disease (GvHD). It has been shown that different C&IPI impede DC maturation and T cell priming both in vitro and in vivo. Herein we sought to understand the mechanism of action of proteasome and immunoproteasome inhibitors on DC and to test their effect on I\u03baB and NF-I\u03baB expression. Materials and Methods We first performed RT PCR on lysates of DC obtained from the peripheral blood of 7 patients who received post-transplant cyclophosphamide and bortezomib as prevention of GvHD on a phase I clinical trial. Patients received allogeneic transplantation from matched-related or unrelated donors. Patients received no other immunosuppressive therapy except for rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin for those receiving graft from unrelated donor. Steroids were not allowed on the study. Samples were obtained on days +1, +4, and +7. The results were analyzed in comparison to samples obtained on day 0 before stem cell infusion. We then performed the same experiment on lysates of DC obtained from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteer donors. DC were untreated or incubated with bortezomib (10 nM for 4 h), carfilzomib (30 nM for 1 h), oprozomib (100 nM and 300 nM for 4 h), ONX 0914 (200 nM for 1 h), PR-825 (125 nM for 1 h), or PR-924 (1000 nM for 1 h). The drug concentration and duration of exposure were chosen based on the IC 50 on proteasome activity and to reproduce in vivo conditions. We also performed I\u03baB western blot on DC isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers, untreated or incubated with bortezomib (10 nM for 4 h) or oprozomib (300 nM for 4 h). Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate. Results We found that the combination of cyclophosphamide and bortezomib significantly and progressively increased I\u03baB mRNA while decreasing NF-\u03baB mRNA in DC studied ex vivo . We also found that all studied C&IPI increased I\u03baB mRNA to a variable degree while only oprozomib (300 nM) decreased NF-\u03baB mRNA in DC in vitro . Finally, both bortezomib and oprozomib increased I\u03baB protein level in DC in vitro ( figure ). Conclusion Our data suggest that C&IPI increase I\u03baB expression in DC. As opposed to the previously reported data in other cell types, the effect is not associated with post-transcriptional downregulation. Cyclophosphamide and bortezomib also decrease NF-\u03baB expression in DC in vivo while only oprozomib had the same effect in vitro . The effect of C&IPI on I\u03baB and NF-\u03baB expression may represent a new mechanism of action and suggests their effect may be cell-type dependent.
