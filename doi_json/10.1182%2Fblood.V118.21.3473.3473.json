    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3473 Background: Only a few studies have addressed the expression of cytokine/chemokine in T-cell lymphomas. The aim of this study was to analyze the cytokine/chemokine protein expression profiles and to correlate them with the pathological manifestation of T-cell lymphomas. Patients and methods: Samples at diagnosis from 19 patients were T-cell lymphoma (unspecified peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), 10 cases; angioimmunoblastic (AITL), 4; ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell (ALCL), 3 and ALK-positive ALCL, 2) and were studied by protein microarrays. The characteristics of the patients were as follows: 11/8 M/F; median age, 55 years. 50% of patients were stage IV, 69% had extranodal involvement, 79% high LDH and 66% high \u03b22 microglobulin. The high or high-intermediate risk IPI and PIT score were 62% and 61%, respectively. We have analyzed the expression of 174 cytokines by using a highly sensitive and specific antibody array containing single band specific primary antibodies duplicate. Chemolumiscence detection was performed by a HRP-conjugated streptavidin in an image analysis system. Densitometry analysis of unsaturated pixels was performed with Image Gauge software and an endogenous housekeeping gene was used to normalize results. Unsupervised clustering analysis was then performed. Results: Three clusters were obtained. Cluster 1 included 5 ALCL, 2 PTCL and 1 AITL, with a cytokine/chemokine profile that had high expression of IL21R, MIG, PDGF AA/AB, LIGHT, IL10, MIP1\u03b3, MIP3\u03b1 and IL13. Cluster 2 was composed by 5 PTCL and 1 AITL and exhibited a profile characterized by the high expression of L-SELECTIN, MMP1, IL1RII, SIGLEC 5, IL10R, IL1\u03b2, IL18BPA, FGF7, IL13RA\u03b12, GMCSF, SDF1\u03b2, LIF, IL1R\u03b1 and IL11. Finally, the analysis defined a cluster 3 constituted by 2 AITL and 3 PTCL with a cytokine/chemokine profile that showed the high expression of TIMP1, NT4, ITAC and IGBP6. Detailed initial features and outcome of the patients according to the clusters are detailed in the table . Cluster 1 had better survival than the other groups (p=0.01). Summary: T-cell lymphomas show three different cytokine/chemokine patterns as was determined by protein microarrays. Cluster 1 was well characterized with the presence of all ALCL and better survival.  Variables . Cluster 1 . Cluster 2 . Cluster 3 . . N=8* . N=6* . N=5* .
