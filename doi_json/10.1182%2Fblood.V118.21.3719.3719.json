    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3719 Introduction: Radio-immunotherapy (RIT) with 131 I-rituximab has demonstrated efficacy in relapsed and refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). 131 I-tositumomab has been shown to be an effective first-line agent in follicular NHL with durable response. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line 131 I-rituximab RIT and the duration of response in previously untreated patients with follicular NHL, given that this radiolabeled chimeric antibody treatment can be repeated upon relapse. Methods: Fifty consecutive patients with newly diagnosed, symptomatic, advanced follicular NHL received a prescribed therapy activity of 131 I-rituximab predicated upon a fixed, whole-body radiation dose of 0.75 Gy. All patients were treated as outpatients. All patients received a standard four-week course of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m 2 in conjunction with the radionuclide therapy, and subsequent rituximab maintenance at 3-monthly intervals for one year. Response was determined by 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans at baseline, and at 3 and 12 months post-treatment. Results: Overall response rate (ORR) at 3 months was 98%, with complete response (CR) seen in 38 patients (76%) and partial response (PR) in 11 patients (22%). Four patients (36%) assessed as having PR at 3 months converted to CR in the year following treatment, so that 84% of patients were in CR at one year. During median follow-up of 33 months (range 12\u201361 months) only one patient (2.6%) among those who had achieved CR has relapsed, while progressive disease has been seen in seven patients (64%) of those with PR at first post-treatment assessment. Only three of the seven patients with PD have so far required further treatment; one with local radiotherapy and two who have received combination chemotherapy. Median progression-free survival (PFS) has not yet been reached. Toxicity was limited to hematological Grade 4 neutropenia in 5 patients (10%) and thrombocytopenia in 5 patients (10%). One patient received a single platelet transfusion. There were no episodes of bleeding or infection. Three patients have died; one from transformed, aggressive NHL (the only non-responder) and the other two from non-hematological malignancies not apparent at study entry. Conclusion: First-line 131 I-rituximab RIT of advanced follicular NHL is effective and safe. Early response rates are similar to those observed with combination chemotherapy and rituximab regimens. Durable CR is present in 82% of patients over a median follow-up of 33 months and median PFS has not yet been reached. Of those with documented PR at 3 months, approximately one-third subsequently converted to CR, while the remaining two-thirds developed PD. Disclosures: Off Label Use: radiolabelled rituximab.",
