    "abstract_text": "Background: Ibrutinib (ibr), a first-in-class, once-daily, covalent, Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is approved in the US for treatment of patients (pts) with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), including pts with del(17p). The activity and safety of ibr in this early phase pivotal study was investigated in pts receiving first line ibr and pts with relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL/SLL. We report data on the longest follow up available, up to 7 y, for pts receiving single-agent ibr. Methods: Phase 1b/2 (PCYC-1102; NCT01105247) and extension study (PCYC-1103; NCT01109069) included pts receiving 420 mg (first line n=26; R/R n=67) or 840 mg QD ibr (first line n=5; R/R n=34) in the first line (\u226565 y) or R/R (\u22651 prior therapy) settings. Ibr was administered until disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. Efficacy was evaluated by investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR, including partial response with lymphocytosis [PR-L]) using consensus criteria for CLL and SLL, duration of response (DOR; PR-L or better), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Responses were assessed for D\u00f6hner hierarchical subgroups. Median (95% CI) survival outcomes are reported. Adverse event (AE) monitoring was from first ibr dose until 30 days after the last dose; generally only grade \u22653 AEs and other significant AEs were collected on PCYC-1103. Results: Of 132 pts, 31 received first line ibr and 101 had R/R disease. As of the cutoff, 17 (55%) first line and 21 (21%) R/R pts continued ibr, with median (range) follow-up of 67 mo (0.7+, 87). Median (range) age for all pts was 68 y (37\u201284); 43% of pts were \u226570 y (first line, 74%; R/R, 34%). Baseline genomic characteristics have been reported and included many high-risk features such as complex karyotype (first line, 13%; R/R, 37%) and unmutated IGHV (first line, 48%; R/R, 78%). R/R pts received a median (range) of 4 prior therapies (1\u201212). ORR was 89% for all pts (complete response [CR], 15%), with similar rates in first line (87% [CR, 32%]) and R/R pts (89% [CR, 10%]). Median DOR was not reached (NR; 95% CI: not estimable [NE], NE) for first line and was 57 mo (38, 80) for R/R pts. Median PFS was NR (95% CI: NE, NE) for first line and was 51 mo (37, 70) for R/R pts ( Fig 1 ); estimated 7 y PFS rates were 80% and 32%, respectively. Median OS was NR in first line (95% CI: 80, NE) or R/R pts (63, NE), with estimated 7 y OS rates of 75% and 52%, respectively. Median OS for pts with PD within 1, 3, and 5 y of treatment initiation was 13 (95% CI: 1, 25), 28 (17, 54), and 57 mo (28, NE), respectively. In R/R pts, median PFS was 26 mo (95% CI: 18, 37) in 34 pts with del(17p), 51 mo (31, 62) in 28 pts with del(11q), 82 mo (7, NE) in 5 pts with trisomy 12, and NR (63, NE) in 13 pts with del(13q). Median PFS was NR (95% CI: 40, NE) in 16 R/R pts with no abovementioned cytogenetic abnormalities. Among R/R pts, median PFS trended longer for 27 pts with 1\u20122 prior lines of therapy (66 [95% CI: 37, NE]) versus 14 pts with 3 (59 [22, NE]) or 60 pts with \u22654 prior lines of therapy (39 [26, 51]). The primary reason for treatment discontinuation in first line pts was AEs (23%), whereas in R/R CLL it was PD (35%). Most common AEs (\u22652 pts) leading to discontinuation were diarrhea, subdural hematoma, and sepsis (n=2 each). Grade \u22653 AEs were reported in 74% of first line and 89% of R/R pts, and serious AEs were reported in 61% of first line and 76% of R/R pts. Hypertension (first line, 32%; R/R, 26%) and pneumonia (first line, 10%; R/R, 27%) were among the most common grade \u22653 treatment-emergent AEs. A similar proportion of first line (10%) and R/R pts (9%) experienced major hemorrhage. Grade \u22653 atrial fibrillation (first line, 6%; R/R, 10%) and infection (first line, 23%; R/R, 55%) were more common in R/R pts. In all pts, grade \u22653 treatment-emergent AEs were highest during the first year of treatment and subsequently declined. Conclusions: With up to 7 y of follow-up, sustained activity of single-agent ibr was observed with first line ibr and for R/R pts with CLL/SLL, including those with high risk genomic factors. Responses were durable, with stable or improved CR rates, and sustained PFS and OS rates (estimated 7 y rates: 80% and 75% for first line pts and 32% and 52% in the highly pretreated R/R population, respectively). In R/R CLL, ibr administration in earlier lines of therapy resulted in improved PFS outcomes, with longer PFS after 1\u20122 versus \u22653 prior lines of therapy. Ibr was acceptably tolerated, and most grade \u22653 AEs declined over time.
