    "abstract_text": "Background: Current treatments for Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia (WM) are not curative, and a standard of care does not exist. MYD88 L265P , a mutation identified in patients (pts) with WM, signals through interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), leading to the constitutive activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway (Yang, 2013). Ibrutinib (ibr), an oral inhibitor of BTK, attenuates the interaction between MYD88 and BTK and blocks BTK-dependent downstream signaling, inducing apoptosis of WM cells (Treon, 2012). In a phase 2 trial of ibr in previously treated WM, durable responses were seen (overall response rate [ORR] of 90.5% and an estimated 24-month PFS of 69.1%; Treon, 2015) leading to FDA and EU approval of ibr in pts with WM. Single-agent ibr indicated favorable responses in pts with WM failing prior monoclonal antibody therapy (Treon, 2015). Here, we report on the efficacy and safety of single-agent ibr in pts with WM refractory to the last rituximab-containing therapy. Methods: Pts with centrally confirmed diagnosis of WM and symptomatic disease requiring treatment per 2 nd International Workshop on WM criteria were enrolled in this open-label, international, multicenter, phase 3 substudy (PCYC-1127 Arm C). Other key inclusion criteria included disease refractory to the last rituximab-containing therapy defined as either relapse after <12 months or failure to achieve at least a minor response. Pts received oral ibr 420 mg daily continuously until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. Main objectives include progression-free survival, ORR, improvement of hemoglobin, and overall survival. Results: Among the 31 pts treated, the median age was 67 years (range, 47-90); 19% had an ECOG performance status of 2, and 42% had a high International Prognostic Score System for WM (IPSSWM). The median number of prior therapies was 4 (range, 1-8; 68% with \u22653 prior therapies). In addition to rituximab, the most common prior treatments included corticosteroids and alkylating agents (Table). The initial ORR at a median follow-up of 7.7 months was 84%, with a major response rate (\u2265PR) of 65%. Five pts required plasmapheresis, with no additional need beyond Cycle 1 in 4 pts. Baseline median hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL increased to 11.4 g/dL after one cycle and baseline median IgM of 3830 mg/dL declined by >50% by end of Cycle 1 (Figure), with continued improvement over time. Any-grade adverse events (AEs) occurred in 29 pts (94%), and grade \u22653 AEs in 16 pts (52%). Most common any-grade AEs (>15%) included diarrhea (39%); hypertension (23%); neutropenia and upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs; 19% each); pyrexia; thrombocytopenia; and increased tendency to bruise (16% each). Common grade \u22653 AEs included neutropenia (13%); anemia, diarrhea, hypertension, and thrombocytopenia (6% each). Overall, 16 pts (52%) developed infections (10% grade \u22653). Serious AEs occurred in 6 pts (19%). All patients remain alive at data cut, with no events of IgM flare, atrial fibrillation or major bleeding. Dose reductions occurred in 4 pts (13%), with no dose reductions for hematologic toxicity. Two pts discontinued ibr-1 pt due to early PD ( MYD88 wild-type), and 1 pt discontinued after 8 days of treatment due to an AE of gastrointestinal AL amyloidosis. Overall, 29 pts (94%) continue on ibr therapy. Additional data will be provided. Conclusions: Single-agent ibr is highly active in this heavily pretreated rituximab-refractory WM population, with a high ORR. No new or unexpected AEs were observed, with a manageable safety profile consistent with previous studies of single-agent ibr. Table 1. Baseline characteristics  . N=31 .
