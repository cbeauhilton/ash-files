    "abstract_text": "We have previously demonstrated that allogeneic blood T cells stimulate cord blood (CB) CD34+ cell differentiation into professional antigen presenting cells (APC) in-vitro and in-vivo ( Abbasian J, Blood  2006 : 108 : 203 \u2013208 ). In this study we immunomagnetically selected human CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and showed that >80% of these cells were positive for FoxP3 intracellular expression. Then we tested whether Tregs may affect CB CD34+ cell clonogenic activity in-vitro an in-vivo, and if co-incubation of Tregs and CD34+ cells may modify the phenotype and function of Tregs. A colony-forming cells (CFU-C) assay performed with CD34+ cells mixed with allogeneic Tregs at 1:2 ratio resulted in comparable numbers of Granulocyte- Macrophage CFU (CFU-GM), burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and CFU-Mix as compared to cultures with CD34+ cells alone (p=0.2, p=0.5 and p=0.5, respectively)(n=3 exps). Human CD34+ cells were co-transplanted with human CD4+CD25+ allogeneic Tregs into NOD/SCID mice at 1:1 and 1:2 ratio. After 6 weeks mice marrow was harvested and showed a 1.3\u00b11.1% (n=3 mice) and 1.6\u00b10.8% (n=4 mice) engraftment of huCD45+ cells, respectively, which was comparable to the engraftment observed in control animals transplanted with CD34+ cells alone (1.4\u00b10.4). In addition, among the engrafted huCD45+ cells similar proportion of CD33+ myeloid cells, CD14+ monocytes and CD1c+ dendritic cells were observed in the three groups of animals. Mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) experiments showed that irradiated CD34+ cells stimulated brisk proliferative responses of CD4+CD25- cells (S:R=1:2), but did not induce any proliferation of Tregs (n=3 exps). After incubation with CD34+ cells in the presence of IL2, on average >80% CD4+CD25+ cells maintained the intracellular expression of FoxP3 and surface expression of CD62L and CD152 (n=3 exps). Then, Tregs autologous to CD34+ cells were isolated from the CB CD34- cell fraction while allogeneic Tregs were isolated from healthy individuals\u2019 peripheral blood. When 2.5 x 10 4 autologous or allogeneic Tregs were added to an MLC with 2.5 x 10 4 irradiated CD34+ stimulator cells and allogeneic responders at 1:2 ratio, they suppressed T cell alloreactivity to CD34+ cells on average by 68\u00b114% and 41\u00b116%, respectively (n=3 exps). Our findings suggest that co-transplantation of CD34+ cells and autologous or allogeneic Tregs may allow normal stem cell engraftment while limiting T cell alloreactivity. These results will prompt the design of new strategies in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, particularly in an HLA incompatible setting."
