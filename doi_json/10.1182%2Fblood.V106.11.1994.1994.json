    "abstract_text": "Resistance to imatinib is a growing concern in CML, particularly in advanced disease. The most common cause of resistance is mutations in BCR-ABL, but other mechanisms have also been identified, including over-expression of BCR-ABL, activation of SRC family kinases and the P-glycoprotein (PGP) efflux pump (via MDR1 over-expression). Dasatinib (BMS-354825) is a novel, oral, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets BCR-ABL and SRC kinases. Dasatinib has 325-fold greater potency versus imatinib in cell lines transduced with wild-type BCR-ABL and is active against 18 out of 19 BCR-ABL mutations tested that confer imatinib resistance ( Shah et al, Science  305 : 399 , 2004 ; O\u2019Hare et al, Cancer Res  65 : 4500 \u20135, 2005 ), and preliminary results from a Phase I study show that it is well tolerated and has significant activity in imatinib-resistant patients in all phases of CML ( Sawyers et al, J Clin Oncol  23 : 565s , 2005 ; Talpaz et al, J Clin Oncol  23 : 564s , 2005 ). We assessed the ability of dasatinib to overcome a variety of mechanisms of imatinib resistance. First, the leukemic-cell killing activity of dasatinib was tested in vitro in three human imatinib-resistant CML cell lines (K562/IM, MEG-01/IM and SUP-B15/IM). Based on IC 50 values, dasatinib had >1000-fold more potent leukemic-cell killing activity compared with imatinib versus all three cell lines. Furthermore, in mice bearing K562/IM xenografts, dasatinib was curative at doses >5 mg/kg, while imatinib had little or no impact at doses as high as 150 mg/kg, its maximum tolerated dose. We determined that the MEG-01/IM and SUP-B15/IM cell lines carried BCR-ABL mutations known to confer imatinib resistance to imatinib clinically (Q252H and F359V, respectively). In K562/IM cells, BCR-ABL mutations or BCR-ABL over-expression were not detected, but the SRC family member FYN was over-expressed. PP2, a known inhibitor of SRC family kinases but not BCR-ABL, could reverse the imatinib resistance in these cells. Together, these data suggest that activation of FYN may be a cause of imatinib resistance in K562/IM. Based on cell proliferation IC 50 , we found that the anti-leukemic activity of dasatinib in K562/IM cells was 29-fold more potent compared with AMN107 (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits BCR-ABL but not SRC family kinases). Given that the human serum protein binding of dasatinib, imatinib and AMN107 were 93, 92 and >99% respectively, the difference in potency between dasatinib and AMN107 in vivo may be far greater than the simple fold-difference in the in vitro IC 50 values. Finally, in K562 cells over-expressing PGP (K562/ADM), we found that dasatinib was only 6-fold less active than in parental K562 cells. Because of the extreme potency of dasatinib in K562 cells, this reduced potency still afforded an IC 50 of 3 nM, which is readily achievable in vivo . Indeed, in mice bearing K562/ADM xenografts, dasatinib was curative at 30 mg/kg, with significant anti-leukemic activity at 15 mg/kg. In conclusion, the rational design of dasatinib as a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor allows this agent to overcome a variety of mechanisms of resistance to imatinib in CML, including mechanisms that are not overcome by agents with a narrower spectrum of inhibition, such as AMN107. Dasatinib is currently in Phase II evaluation in imatinib-resistant/-intolerant patients in the \u2018START\u2019 program, and in Phase I evaluation in solid tumors."
