    "abstract_text": "Systemic administration of IL-2 may improve the expansion and persistence of adoptively transferred anti-tumor CTLs. However, significant toxicity and concomitant expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) limit the clinical value of this strategy. IL-7 plays a crucial role in maintaining T-cell homeostasis, and administration appears well tolerated and not to expand Tregs. Nonetheless, the value of IL-7 for promoting proliferation of tumor-specific CTLs after adoptive transfer remains questionable, due to the lack of expression of the IL-7 receptor (IL-7R\u03b1) on effector CTLs. Thus we have found IL-7R\u03b1 to be essentially undetectable in our model of EBV-specific CTL lines (EBV-CTLs) due to downregulation of IL-7R\u03b1 transcripts. To determine whether transgenic expression of IL-7R\u03b1 can restore the capacity of established EBV-CTLs to respond to IL-7, the full-length of IL-7R\u03b1 was cloned in the SFG retroviral vector (SFG/IL-7R\u03b1). We transduced EBV-CTLs generated from 5 healthy donors and evaluated their growth kinetics and antigen specificity. As control, EBV-CTLs were transduced with the SFG retroviral vector encoding for a truncated form of the CD34 molecule (SFG.\u0394CD34). After transduction with SFG/IL-7R\u03b1, IL-7R\u03b1 was detectable in 58% to 76% of EBV-CTLs. The transgenic IL-7R\u03b1 was functional since addition of IL-7 (2ng/mL) to transgenic cells induced phosphorylation of STAT5 within 10 min. To evaluate whether rhIL-7 sustained the expansion of EBV-CTLs/IL-7R\u03b1+, transduced CTLs were stimulated weekly with autologous EBV-LCLs in the presence of IL-2 (50U/mL) or IL-7 (2ng/mL). Control EBV-CTLs and EBV-CTLs/IL-7R\u03b1+ expanded equally well with IL-2. However, only EBV-CTL/IL-7R\u03b1+ significantly proliferated in the presence of IL-7 [from 1\u00d710 6 cells to 103\u00d710 6 cells (range, 38-286\u00d710 6 )] over a period of five weeks. CTL expansion remained antigen dependent, and antigen withdrawal led to cessation of CTL growth. EBV-CTLs/IL-7R\u03b1+ showed the expected growth advantage in the presence of IL-7, increasing from 55%\u00b115% to 79%\u00b15% of the total within 5 weeks. In contrast, the proportion of IL-7R\u03b1+ cells marginally declined when the cells were expanded with IL-2 (from 64%\u00b114% to 40%\u00b111%). Importantly, EBV-CTLs/IL7R\u03b1+ expanded with IL-7 retained their ability to respond to other common-\u03b3-chain cytokines. EBV-CTLs/IL7R\u03b1+ grown with IL-7 for more than 2 weeks, expanded further when exposed to both antigen and IL-2 or IL-15. Control CTLs grown with IL-2 and EBV-CTLs/IL-7R\u03b1+ grown with IL-7 both remained polyclonal, as assessed by V\u03b2TCR repertoire analysis, and were mostly CD3+/CD8+ (> 90\u00b18%) with an effector-memory profile. EBV-CTLs/IL-7R\u03b1+ also retained antigen specificity measured by tetramer staining, by IFN\u03b3 release in response to EBV-peptides and by MHC-restricted killing of autologous LCLs (52%\u00b118% at a ratio 20:1 vs 9\u00b117% of allogeneic LCL); this killing was comparable to the activity of control CTLs cultured in IL-2 (51%\u00b127%). Preliminary studies indicate that EBV-CTLs/IL-7R\u03b1+ also expand in vivo in response to IL-7 and maintain their anti-tumor activity in a SCID mouse xenograft model."
