    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Bortezomib (B) is the first proteasome inhibitor to be used in clinical practice and has been recently approved for second line treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) patients(pts). Several trials demonstrated that Bortezomib is relatively well tolerated; however, manageable non-hematologic and hematologic toxicity has been reported. The dose limiting toxicity is peripheral neuropathy (PN), reported up to 35% of the patient population. AIM: We evaluated the incidence and severity of PN in 179 MM patients that received B as single agent or in combination. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients characteristics were as follows: median age was 66.7 years (range: 32\u201382) with 52% male; 55 patients were at the onset of the disease, 124 were pre-treated. Median time from diagnosis to treatment with B was 25.4 months (range 0\u2013111), median value of \u03b22-microglobulin was 3.02 (0.2\u201320). Risk factors for PN included prior use of thalidomide in 68 patients (38%), vincristine in 75 patients (41.8%) and 15 patients (8.8%) had diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: Patients received bortezomib alone (?) or in combination with either dexamethasone (n=52), or chemotherapy (n=114) or thalidomide (n=38). Overall, the response rate (\u2265PR) was 86%. PN of grade \u22652 was observed in 73 pts (41%); grade 3\u20134 occurred in 32 (18%). Median time to the onset of bortezomib-related PN was 84 days (range, 10\u2013449) after bortezomib initiation. In most cases (93%), patients had sensory symptoms, while 5 patients (7%) experienced both sensory and motor symptoms. Bortezomib-related PN led to therapy discontinuation in 31 pts (17%). For PN treatment, pts received mostly supportive therapy (analgesics, gabapentin, pregabalin, amitriptyline and vitamin supplements). Of the 31 patients with bortezomib-related PN that required discontinuation, resolution or improvement occurred in 16 (51.6%), at a median time of 140 days (range, 27\u2013346) from B discontinuation. Data analysis of the PN risk factors (age, diabetes, sex, \u03b22M, neurotoxic pre-treatment) showed a significant association with age >75 years (p<0.013) and a trend with thalidomde pre-treatment (p=0.07); noteworthy, PN risk was not increased in pts treated with bortezomib and thalidomide in combination. Furthermore, responses were independent to PN. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, PN is a relatively frequent side effect of bortezomib treatment, generally manegeable by dose reduction or discontinuation and reversible in the majority of pts. Patients with advanced age can be considered at higher risk, while the combination of thalidomide and bortezomib did not increase the risk of PN. Further studies are needed to better define the PN pathogenesis and develop optimal strategies to improve the B related PN management.",
