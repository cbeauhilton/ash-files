    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Whether adolescent (alc) patients with HL represent a distinct patient group, requiring a therapy strategy separated from adults, is currently focussed in international debates. Most study groups are treating adult (ad) patients (pts) (age > 18 years) apart from younger patients (age < 18 years), considering a difference in treatment related toxicity and therapy outcome in both patient groups. Between 1988 and 1998, the GHSG trial generations 2 (G2) and 3 (G3) included younger patients from the age of 15 (G2), and 16 (G3), in identically therapy regimen with adults up to 65, and 75 years. The trials for early stages HD were comparing radiation therapy (RX) arms only (HD4, recruited 1988\u20131993), and, RX vs 2 cycles polychemotherapy plus RX (HD7, 1993\u20131998). Intermediate stages HD received 2 cycles of different chemotherapy regimen plus identically RX (HD5, 1988\u20131993), and, 2 identically cycles of chemotherapy plus different RX (HD8, 1993\u20131998). Advanced stages HL were treated with either 4 cycles conventional polychemotherapy plus EF, or, 4 cycles of a hybrid regimen plus EF RX (HD6, 1988\u20131993); the following trial (HD9, 1993\u20131998) compared 3 arms of different polychemotherapy followed by RX on bulky disease. Methods: In G2 and G3, a total of 573 adolescents (15\u201321 yrs) in early, intermediate, and advanced stages HL were compared with 4917 pts (15\u201375 yrs) for complete remission rate (CR), 5 yrs survival rate (SV), 5 yrs freedom from treatment failure (FFTF), and, secondary neoplasias (2nd NPL). (table 1) Conclusion: Based on this large analysis of HL patients treated in prospectively randomized trials, the prognosis of patients aged 15\u201321 years is rather similar to the prognosis of adult patients. A more detailed evaluation including age-adapted prognosis will be presented. Results: Adolescents /Adults  . . CR % . 5 yrs FFTF % . 5 yrs SV % . . . Alc . Ad . Alc . Ad . Alc . Ad .
