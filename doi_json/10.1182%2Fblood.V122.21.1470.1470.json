    "abstract_text": "Introduction The human organic cation transporter-1 (hOCT-1) is the primary active influx protein for imatinib in BCR-ABL positive cells. The functional activity of the OCT-1 protein (OCT-1 activity, OA) is predictive of molecular response in de-novo chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) patients. We have previously demonstrated that diclofenac, a competitive peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) antagonist, can significantly increase OA in CML cells 1 . However, the role of PPAR\u03b3 and its ligands in OA regulation remain unknown. Thus, the link between OA and PPAR\u03b3 in CML cells has been investigated in this study. Methods OA was determined by intracellular uptake and retention assay (IUR) in the presence and absence of the OCT-1 inhibitor, prazosin 2 . To assess the effect of PPAR\u03b3 ligands on OA, BCR-ABL positive cell lines (KU812, K562) were incubated with PPAR\u03b3 antagonist (GW9662, T0070907) or agonists (GW1929, rosiglitazone) respectively for 1 hour immediately prior to the IUR assays. The OA was also assessed in the mononuclear cells (MNCs) of 77 CP-CML patients enrolled to the TIDEL II trial. PPAR\u03b3 activity in CML MNC nuclear extracts was determined through the use of a PPAR\u03b3 Transcription Factor Assay Kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. To assess the effect of PPAR\u03b3 ligands on cell death, KU812 or K562 cells were stained with AnnexinV and 7-AAD for detection of apoptosis after the co-administration of imatinib and PPAR\u03b3 ligands for 72 hours. Results A significant increase in OA was observed in KU812 and K562 cells treated with PPAR\u03b3 antagonists. In contrast, PPAR\u03b3 agonists significantly decreased the OA in both cell lines ( Table 1 ). A negative link between OA and PPAR\u03b3 activity was observed in CML MNC samples (R=-0.585, p <0.001). PPAR\u03b3 activity was significantly elevated in CML patients who had a low OA at diagnosis (less than 4 ng/200,000 cells) compared with those who had higher OA ( p <0.001). After 72 hours co-administration with 0.1\u00b5M imatinib, KU812 cells treated with PPAR\u03b3 antagonists (GW9662 and T0070907) showed a significantly lower cell viability (40% and 18% respectively) compared with vehicle control (70%, p <0.001). Similar results were also observed in K562 cells after co-administration with 1.0\u00b5M imatinib for 72 hours. K562 cells treated with PPAR\u03b3 antagonists (GW9662: 51% and T0070907: 47%) showed a significantly lower cell viability (51% and 47% respectively) compared with vehicle control (61%, p <0.05).

Low PPAR\u03b3 activity may be the key driver for low OA and poor imatinib response observed in a subset of CML patients. Importantly, the enhanced OA as a result of PPAR\u03b3 antagonist treatment resulted in increased cell death following co-administration with imatinib. Ongoing studies relating to the upstream pathways involved in PPAR\u03b3 activation aim to reveal the possible mechanism of OA modulation by PPAR\u03b3. Enhancement of OA by PPARg antagonists is likely to provide an important axis for clinical application to improve the clinical efficacy of imatinib. This would be particularly important in patients with low OA who currently have inferior outcomes with imatinib therapy. 1. Wang J, Hughes TP, Kok CH, et al.
