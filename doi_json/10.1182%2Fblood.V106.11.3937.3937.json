    "abstract_text": "Human platelet PDE3A degrades cAMP, the major intracellular inhibitor of platelet function, and thus potentiates platelet activation. PDE3A is irreversibly inactivated by the affinity label Sp-cAMPS-BDB. The inactivation is prevented by Sp-cAMPS indicating that the affinity label is targeted at the cAMP binding site. We now use Sp-cAMPS-BDB with the aim of identifying nonconserved amino acids in substrate binding. After incubating Sp-cAMPS-BDB with PDE3A followed by reduction with [ 3 H]NaBH 4 , the incorporation was 1.1 mol/mol. HPLC analysis of the tryptic digest yielded a radioactive octapeptide T 806 YNVTDDK 813 in the 44-amino acid insert of PDE3A. Molecular modeling of PDE3A based on the PDE3B structure suggests the insert is a flexible loop. Incorporation of Sp-cAMPS-BDB indicates loop interaction with the substrate. Since Sp-cAMPS-BDB reacts with the nucleophilic residues, Y807, D811 and D812 were each mutated to alanine. Sp-cAMPS-BDB inactivates D811A and D812A but not Y807A, suggesting Y807 is the residue modified by Sp-cAMPS-BDB. Y807A affects the K m but not k cat , suggesting its involvement in cAMP binding. Kinetic analyses of 11 loop mutants reveal that H782A, T810A, Y814A and C816S each affects the k cat but not K m , indicating that catalysis is modulated. We conclude that binding of cAMP to the flexible loop of platelet PDE3A induces a conformational change which allows interaction with essential catalytic residues. These findings provide a new strategy for developing antiplatelet agents to treat patients with reocclusion of coronary arteries who are resistant to aspirin or whose chronic congestive heart failure prevents utilizing cilostazol.",
