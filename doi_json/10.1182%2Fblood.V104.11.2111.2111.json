    "abstract_text": "To study transplanted unperturbed and mobilized long-term hematopoiesis after selection with an alkylating agent, bone marrow (BM) from 5 C57BL/6J mice was pooled, repeatedly transduced with retroviruses encoding the alkylating agent resistance protein O 6 -Methylguanine-DNA and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) as an easily traceable marker. Between 1 to 9x10 5 transfected BM cells were transplanted into 15 myeloablatively irradiated sex-mismatched C57BL/6J mice. Subsequently, 3 to 4 selection rounds with BCNU/O 6 -BG were carried out, enriching eGFP marked hematopoiesis in these mice up to 70\u201390%. Between 1 and 7x10 7 BM cells of different mice were transplanted according to marrow location into groups of 5 sex-matched Bri44[ 1 ] mice. Two mice each received BM from the hind limbs, two from the pelvis and one received cells from the spleen, only, respectively. Altogether the study comprised 15 groups divided into 6 female and 9 male groups. Of these, 4 male and 3 female groups received 3 HSC-mobilization courses with G-CSF at intervals of 2 months starting 3 month after transplantation. Hematopoiesis in the other fraction remained unperturbed. During the observation period of 11\u201314 months in these tertiary recipients, repeated FACS analyses as well as linear amplification mediated (LAM) PCRs were carried out to track the clonal contributions. A decrease in the percentage of eGFP expressing marked hematopoiesis was observed in most cases. However, eGFP expression never disappeared altogether and could still be detected in the different hematopoietic lineages and successfully sorted for further analyses by MoFlo (Dako-Cytomation). Assessment of the clonal status of the Bri44 by LAM-PCR displayed interesting results. In some mice a decline in clone numbers was observed, whereas clone numbers remained stable in others. Tertiary transplantation with long-term follow-up indicates that this observation may be related to the transplantation of limited long-term repopulating clone numbers and progenitor cell exhaustion over time.",
