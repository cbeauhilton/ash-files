    "abstract_text": "Around 45% of adults with AML have NC and are included in an intermediate-risk group. However, their 5-year (yr) overall survival (OS) rates vary between 24 and 42%, likely due to the prognostic impact of submicroscopic genetic alterations, e.g., mutations in FLT3 , CEBPA , MLL and NPM genes and overexpression of BAALC . We recently showed that ERG , an ETS-Related Gene mapped to 21q22, is often overexpressed in AML with unfavorable complex karyotypes, and in a subset of NC AML ( PNAS  2004 ; 101 : 3915 ), suggesting that ERG overexpression contributes to an aggressive phenotype in AML. Here we analyzed ERG expression levels by real-time RT-PCR in pretreatment blood from 84 adults with NC AML, aged <60 yrs, treated on CALGB 9621 and characterized for BAALC expression ( Blood  2003 ; 102 : 1613 ). Patients (pts) were divided into quartiles according to ERG levels and dichotomized into 2 groups: the uppermost quartile of ERG expression values (Q4) and a group comprising 3 lower quartiles (Q1-3), as relapse risk was significantly different for Q4 compared with Q1 ( P =.024), Q2 ( P =.002) and Q3 ( P =.009). The complete remission rates were similar for the 2 groups (76% vs. 83%; P =.532). With a median follow-up of 5.7 yrs, Q4 pts had a worse cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR; P <.001) and OS ( P =.011) than Q1-3 pts. For Q4 pts, the estimated 5-yr CIR and OS rates were, respectively, 81% and 19% compared with 33% and 51% for Q1-3 pts. In multivariable models, high ERG expression (Q4) adversely impacted CIR ( P <.001), whereas an interaction between ERG and BAALC expression ( P =.013) was observed for OS, where Q4 predicted shorter survival only in low BAALC expressers ( P =.002; Table 1). Table 1. Multivariable analysis for pts divided into Q4 and Q1-3 groups according to ERG expression  Endpoint . Variable . Hazard ratio (95% CI) . P .

We also used Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 GeneChips to identify genes differentially expressed ( P \u2264 .001) between Q4 and Q1-3 pts. Q4 pts displayed a signature characterized by overexpression of 63 genes and 49 expressed-sequenced tags. Fourteen genes, including general ( GTF2H2 ) and lineage-specific ( BCL11A, HEMGN ) transcription regulators and genes involved in cell proliferation ( RAB10, GAS5 ) and apoptosis ( IKIP , DAPK ), had at least a two-fold difference in expression levels between the Q4 and Q1-3 groups. In conclusion, we show for the first time that ERG overexpression in NC AML constitutes an adverse prognostic factor and is associated with a distinct gene-expression signature."
