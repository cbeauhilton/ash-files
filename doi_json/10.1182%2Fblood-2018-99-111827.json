    "abstract_text": "Mutations within BCR-ABL1 , the oncogene giving rise to chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), can lead to resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and some are associated with clinically more aggressive disease and worse outcome (Branford et al., 2003). This phenomenon was faithfully recapitulated in our murine transduction/transplantation model of BCR-ABL1 + CML, in which recipients of bone marrow transduced with the imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL1 point mutant T315I (or Y253F) had shortened survival, compared to wild-type BCR-ABL1 . Consistent with the situation in humans we found an increase in the number of blast-like cells and alterations of the immunophenotypic composition of cells in the bone marrow of murine recipients of BCR-ABL1 T315I+ leukaemia-initiating cells (LIC). To understand the interaction between BCR-ABL1 + LIC and the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM), a complex entity of cellular and acellular constituents, which may influence the course of the disease, we used a combination of confocal and 2-photon intravital microscopy of the murine calvarium. BCR-ABL1 T315I + Lin - c-Kit + Sca-1 + (LKS) cells, which contain the leukaemic stem cell (LSC) fraction in this model, homed closer to osteoblastic cells thanLKS cells expressing native BCR-ABL1 which suggests a differential homing location of BCR-ABL1 T315I+ LSC. Indeed, in a transwell migration assay we demonstrated faster migration of BCR-ABL1 T315I+ compared toBCR-ABL1 + cells. Other experiments revealed an altered actin cytoskeleton and striking differences in focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a component of integrin mediated focal adhesion sites, in BCR-ABL1 T315I+ compared to wildtype BCR-ABL1+ cells. Additionally, in in vivo and ex vivo studies we showed that integrin \u03b23 was overexpressed in BCR-ABL1 T315I+ compared to wildtype BCR-ABL1 + cells, and that further overexpression of integrin \u03b23 significantly reduced the tumor load and prolonged the survival of mice with BCR-ABL1 + , but especially BCR-ABL1 T315I+ CML. Further, we found another component of the focal adhesion complex, namely integrin linked kinase (ILK) and its phosphorylated form (pS243) to be more highly expressed in BCR-ABL1 T315I+ compared to BCR-ABL1 + wildtype cells. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of ILK in BCR-ABL1 T315I+ LIC significantly reduced the tumor load and prolonged survival in recipient mice. Inhibition of ILK by the use of a commercially available (non clinical grade) inhibitor (Cpd22) in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor ponatinib prolonged the survival of mice compared to treatment with ponatinib alone, further confirming an important role of ILK in BCR-ABL1 T315I+ disease. Fibronectin is a known interaction partner of integrins in the extracellular matrix of the BMM and, as previously reported, its deposition in the extracellular matrix can be regulated by ILK. We found that the deposition of fibronectin in BCR-ABL1 T315I + disease was decreased compared to BCR-ABL1 + wildtypecells. Intrafemoral or intravenous administration of fibronectin, however, led to a significant prolongation of survival in 70% of mice with BCR-ABL1 T315I + CML, and knockdown of ILK in BCR-ABL1 T315I + LIC led to a replenishment of fibronectin levels in the BMM. In confirmation of these murine data, bone sections of patients with BCR-ABL1 T315I+ CML revealed decreased levels of fibronectin,and Western blot analysis of human BCR-ABL1 T315I+ CML cellsshowed increased levels of ILK and pS243ILK compared to the BCR-ABL1 + controls. In summary, these data suggest that interactions with the BMM via the integrin \u03b23/ILK-mediated signaling pathway may influence leukaemic progression and clinical outcome in BCR-ABL1 T315I+ imatinib-resistant CML. Targeting the interaction of BCR-ABL1 T315I+ leukemia cells with the BMM in the form of ILK inhibition or administration of fibronectin may offer a beneficial, innovative, adjunct treatment strategy for patients with BCR-ABL1 T315I+ CML and, as to be tested, possibly also other leukaemias.
