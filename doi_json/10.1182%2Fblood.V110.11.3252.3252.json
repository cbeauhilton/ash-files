    "abstract_text": "Background: CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cell has been found to play an important role in suppressing allogenetic immune response and controlling GVHD recently. Our study was to explore the reconstitution of CD4 + CD25 high regulatory T cells early after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT), and to evaluate its role in the development of acute Graft-versus- host disease(aGVHD) Methods : 27 patients undergoing allo-HSCT were enrolled. Detect the CD4 + CD25 high T cells subpopulation ratios in CD4 + T lymphocytes(CD4 + CD25 high /CD4 + )with Flow cytometry, and the expression of FOXP3 mRNA with Real-time PCR assays in the donor grafts and periperal blood frequently after transplantation(at 2 weeks,1 month,2 month,3 month post-transpant,at the onset of aGVHD,and when aGVHD was controlled.). Results: In without aGVHD group, the CD4 + CD25 high /CD4 + ratio increased significantly at 2 weeks post-transplant, and decreased later(P<0.05); the expression of FOXP3 increased significantly early after transplantation, but remained below the healthy-control level within 3 months after transplantation( P <0.05). In aGVHD-group, the CD4 + CD25 high /CD4 + ratio also increased significantly at 2 weeks post-transplant,but exhibited no decrease tendency later(P<0.05);moreover the expression of FOXP3 remained low( P <0.05),and was lower than the without-aGVHD-group at 1\u223c3month post-transplant( P <0.05). At the onset of aGVHD, the CD4 + CD25 + /CD4 + and the CD4 + CD25 high /CD4 + ratios were both higher than the healthy control and without-aGVHD group( P <0.05),but the expression of FOXP3 were lower than that of healthy control and without-aGVHD group( P <0.05);when aGVHD was controlled, the expression of FOXP3 raised compared with that at the onset of aGVHD( P =0.025), also the CD4 + CD25 high /CD4 + ratio exhibited an increase tendency( P =0.050). Conlusion : The CD4 + CD25 high regulatory T cells subpopulation undergo a significant expansion early after transplantation, but its complete reconstitution is a long-term process. The lower number of CD4 + CD25 high regulatory T cells and/or their lower expression of FOXP3 gene may be related with the development of aGVHD."
