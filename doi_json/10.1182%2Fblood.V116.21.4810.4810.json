    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4810 Introduction: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder where the red blood cells assume an abnormal, rigid, sickle shape, causing tissue hypoxia with subsequent increase of osteoclastic activity, originating osteopenia and osteoporosis. The prevalence of the osteoporosis in the SCD can vary from 25 a 50%, affecting more commonly the children. There are few data regarding the prevalence of bone mineral low density in adults. Our objective was to analyse the calcium profile and bone mineral density (BMD) of pacients with SCD and describe the prevalence of osteopenia in this group. Material and Methods: We have studied 49 patients with SCD analysing the serum and 24 hours urinary calcium, serum ferritin, LDH, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and BMD in the lombar vertebrae and proximal femoral. Results: From the 49 patients, 21(42.9%) were males and 28(57.1%) females, mean age of 27 years old (16-51 yr), 55.1% (27) of the patients presented osteopenia and 26.5% (13) osteoporosis, considering lombar vertebrae BMD. Only 18.4% (9) had normal BMD. Mean \u00b1 DP PTH was 85.3 \u00b1 79.32 and mean \u00b1 DP serum calcium of 8.9 \u00b1 0.44. Mean \u00b1 DP LDH was 970.8 \u00b1 492.36 and we have observed significant correlation between this variable and low BMD (p<0.02). Conclusion: The prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was extremely high (81.6%) in the studied patitents. The secondary hyperparatireoidism was present in many patients and we did not find hypoparathyroidism. The hemolysis appears as a factor that contributes for the low BMD.
