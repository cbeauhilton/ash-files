    "abstract_text": "Abstract 701 Diadenosine triphosphate (Ap3A) is a component of platelet dense granules, and is released into the extracellular space during the second wave of platelet aggregation following platelet activation by ADP and other agonists. Ap3A has long been thought to stimulate platelet aggregation after release into the extracellular space by providing a prolonged source of ADP via hydrolysis by a slow extracellular enzyme present in human plasma. Here, we identify NPP-4, a member of the nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase enzyme family present on endothelial cell surfaces, as a potent hydrolase of Ap3A capable of stimulating platelet aggregation and secretion at nanomolar concentrations. We performed lumiaggregometry with citrated platelet-rich plasma in the presence of Ap3A with or without increasing nanomolar concentrations of NPP-4. In these experiments we determined that Ap3A alone in concentrations up to 80 uM initiated a primary wave of platelet aggregation that was followed by rapid disaggregation. In the presence of nanomolar concentrations of NPP-4, however, the primary and secondary waves of platelet aggregation and dense granule release are strongly induced in an enzyme concentration-dependent fashion. In contrast, mutant NPP-4, catalytically inactivated by an active site threonine to alanine mutation, had no effect on platelet aggregation and dense granule release under identical conditions. In order to clarify the structural basis of the enzymatic mechanism, we determined the high-resolution structure of NPP4 in the presence and absence of the enzymatic product, AMP. In aggregate, our studies define the biological, enzymatic, and molecular basis for NPP-4 and Ap3A activity in platelet aggregation and secretion in vitro and suggest that NPP-4 may play a role in hemostasis in vivo by augmenting platelet aggregation and release of granule contents at the site of vascular injury. With these studies we have thus established the molecular foundation for the rational development of a new class of therapeutics capable of modulating vascular thrombosis.
