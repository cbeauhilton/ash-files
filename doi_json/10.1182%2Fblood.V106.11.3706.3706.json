    "abstract_text": "Hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) encompasses a family of inherited erythrocyte disorders characterized by red blood cells with an oval, elongated shape. Diagnosis is most commonly made upon peripheral smear examination. Although the disorder is usually clinically silent, these patients may have some degree of chronic hemolysis that may necessitate splenectomy on occasion. We report a consistent finding in HE common to most electronic cell counters. The red blood cell histogram reliably has a two to three millimeter elevation above baseline at the extreme left of the graph. This \u201cfoot\u201d on the histogram is predictive of possible red blood cell elliptocytes. Please see example. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure ",
