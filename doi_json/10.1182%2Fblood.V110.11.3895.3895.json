    "abstract_text": "The inhibition of platelet aggregation by aspirin (ASA) is fundamental in treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD). Several studies report findings of normal platelet aggregation despite ASA treatment in some individuals, referred to as ASA resistance (AR). It has been hypothesized that AR increases the risk of a future ischemic event. We evaluated a new impedance method for measurement of platelet aggregation, Multiplate\u00ae aggregometry (MA), and compared this method to light aggregometry ad modum Born (OPA), with reference to repeatability and detection of AR. Blood samples from 43 IHD patients and 21 healthy individuals treated with ASA 75 mg daily were analyzed in duplicate by MA and OPA on 4 consecutive days. An additional blood sample was obtained prior to ASA treatment in the group of healthy individuals. Compliance was confirmed by measurements of thromboxane B 2 in serum. MA was performed with arachidonic acid (AA) in concentrations of 0.25 mM, 0.50 mM and 0.75 mM, and with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in concentrations of 7.5 \u03bcM and 15 \u03bcM. OPA was performed with AA-concentrations of 0.5 mM, 1.0 mM and 1.5 mM, and with ADP-concentrations of 5 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM. Table 1.

The reduction of AUC was small and insignificant when using ADP (5\u201311%, p\u22650.06). There was a trend towards a higher median AUC measured in patients than in healthy individuals during ASA (p=0.07). Table 2.

The reference method was OPA with AA 1.0 mM and AR was defined as a residual platelet aggregation \u2265 20%. According to this definition 7 participants (16%) had AR. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis showed a sensitivity of MA using AA 0.75 mM of 100% at an AUC cut-point of 94 aggregation units (AU) \u00b7 min, 71% at 135 AU \u00b7 min and 29% at 212 AU \u00b7 min. The specificity was 60, 81 and 93%, respectively. The area under the ROC-curve was 0.79 (95% CI 0.66\u20130.92). In conclusion, the large ASA-induced reduction in AUC of healthy individuals indicated that MA measures the effect of ASA efficiently when using AA. ADP seems less suitable, as the AUC was only slightly reduced by ASA. The CV of MA was high during ASA treatment, indicating that platelet aggregation during ASA was low and difficult to measure precisely with MA. The area under the ROC-curve was moderately satisfying, but of uncertain correctness due to the rather small number of observations."
