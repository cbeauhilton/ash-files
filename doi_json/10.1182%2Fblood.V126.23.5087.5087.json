    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND Primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (PCMZL) are low-grade lymphomas with an indolent course, but with a high rate of skin relapses. Surgical excision, local radiotherapy, or combinations of both are the first-line treatment in solitary or localized disease. Therapeutic options in cases of multifocal disease or relapse, include steroids or intravenous Rituximab in monotherapy or in combination with intravenous or oral chemotherapy. The effectiveness of intralesional Rituximab (ILR) in primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas has been described in a small multicenter series of patients. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ILR in patients with PCMZL. METHODS In our center ILR is used since 2010 as fist-line treatment for patients with PCMZL with single facial lesions, multifocal disease that cannot be irradiated or in relapsed disease. The treatment regimen consist of a course of three injections of 10 mg ( days 1, 3 and 5) in a single week at monthly intervals. Oral paracetamol and dexclofeniramire were administrated 30 minutes before the procedure. Courses of ILR were monthly repeated until response or in cases of relapse. The primary outcome measure of the study was the rate of remissions (complete and partial remissions). RESULTS Eleven patients with PCMZL have been treated so far: 55% as first-line treatment and 45% in the relapse setting. The relapsed-group had previously received a median of 3 previous treatments (range, 1-6) including radiotherapy in 5 cases, surgery in 1 case, intravenous chemotherapy in 2 cases, and topic steroids in 2 cases. Clinical characteristics of the 11 patients are shown in the table below. A total of 40 courses or ILR have been completed. All patients responded, with 73% complete responses, without evidence of progression or relapse in the site of ILR treatment. Four patients experienced transitory mild perilesional erythema that did not require medication and resolved in less than 4 hours. No systemic toxicities or infections were observed; the tolerance was excellent in all cases. CONCLUSIONS In our preliminary experience, ILR is an effective and safe therapeutic approach for selected PCMZL patients with single facial lesion, multifocal disease than cannot be irradiated or in relapsed cases. Further controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings. View large Download slide View large Download slide  Disclosures Sureda: Takeda: Consultancy, Speakers Bureau."
