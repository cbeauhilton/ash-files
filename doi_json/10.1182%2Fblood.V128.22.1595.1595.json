    "abstract_text": "Background Methotrexate (MTX) is a key chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Nevertheless, MTX can cause severe adverse effects and toxicities. The aim of the present study was to identify genetic polymorphisms in candidate genes of the MTX pathway associated with MTX pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and outcome in ALL in China. Methods Three hundred and twenty-two Chinese children with ALL in the standard-risk and medium-risk treatment branches from the Beijing Children's Hospital-2003 and Chinese Childhood Leukemia Group-2008 protocols were enrolled in this study. Sequenom MassARRAY was used to genotype 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4 candidate genes of the MTX/folate pathway. A total of 1268 high-dose MTX (HD-MTX) courses were analyzed. The plasma MTX levels were evaluated at 48 h after the first dose of HD-MTX infusion. Oral mucositis during the consolidation therapy period was recorded. Results No polymorphism was associated with clinical features, prednisone response, and minimal residual disease (MRD) at day 33 and 78. Long-term outcome was better in SLCO1B1 rs4149056 T and TC allele carriers than patients with C allele (5-year RFS 92.3\u00b11.6% vs. 27.8\u00b123.2%, P <0.0001), in ABCB1 rs1128503 T and TC allele carriers than patients with C allele (92.7\u00b11.6% vs. 78.2\u00b16.9%, P =0.020), and in SCL19A1 rs2838958 AG and G allele carries than patients with A allele (93.9\u00b11.6% vs. 83.0\u00b14.2%, P =0.010). Multiple Cox regression analyses revealed an association of MRD at day 33 (hazard ratio 3.356; P =0.018), MRD at day 78 (hazard ratio 2.843; P =0.034), and SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (hazard ratio 8.073; P =0.002) with RFS in the study population. As to MTX pharmacokinetics, ABCB1 rs1128503 showed a significant association with serum MTX levels ( P =0.004). SNPs (rs3788200, rs1131596, rs1051266) of the SLC19A1 gene were also associated with the plasma levels of MTX ( P =0.003, 0.004, and 0.003, respectively). No association was found between oral mucositis with any polymorphism. Conclusions Genetic variations substantially influence the kinetics and response to HD-MTX therapy in childhood ALL. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
