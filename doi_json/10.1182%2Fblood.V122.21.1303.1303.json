    "abstract_text": "Background Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) is the largest and most heterogeneous cytogenetic AML subgroup. For the practicing clinician it is difficult to know how to use the prognostic information of the growing number of clinical and molecular markers. Our purpose was to develop a widely applicable prognostic model by combining well-established pre-treatment patient and molecular characteristics. Patients and methods Two p rognostic i ndices for C N - A ML, one with regard to o verall s urvival (PINA OS ) and the other regarding r elapse- f ree s urvival (PINA RFS ) were derived based on a cohort of 669 CN-AML patients treated within the AML Cooperative Group 99 (AMLCG99) study. Results Based on age (median: 60 years [range: 17-85 years]), performance status, white blood count, and presence or absence of NPM1 mutation, biallelic CEBPA mutation, and FLT 3-ITD, patients were classified into three risk groups according to PINA OS and PINA RFS : 29% of all and 32% of responding patients had low risk (5-year OS 72%; 5-year RFS 55%), 56% and 39% intermediate risk (5-year OS 28%; 5-year RFS 27%), and 15% and 29% high risk disease (5-year OS 3%; 5-year RFS 8%) ( Figure 1 ). PINA OS and PINA RFS further subdivided the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) favorable-genetic group as well as the ELN intermediate-I-genetic group. Both, PINA OS and PINA RFS were confirmed in a large, independent, and comparable CN-AML cohort of 529 patients from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB/Alliance) trials ( Figure 2 ).

Close modal Conclusions We have developed and validated the first prognostic indices specifically designed for CN-AML patients of all ages combining well-established molecular and clinical variables easily applicable in routine clinical care. The integration of both clinical and molecular markers could provide a basis for individualized patient care by risk-adapted therapy of CN-AML.
