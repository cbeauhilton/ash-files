    "abstract_text": "Imatinib (IM) at 400 mg daily is the first line therapy for newly diagnosed CML patients (pts); however, less than 50% of major molecular responses (MMR) are obtained at 12 months. To improve these results, we designed a phase III, multicenter, open-label, prospective randomized trial. The reference arm was IM 400 mg daily (n=159). The 3 experimental arms were IM 600 mg daily (n=160), IM 400mg daily in combination with Ara-C, (20 mg/m 2 /day, days 15\u201328 of 28-day cycles)(n=158) and IM 400mg in combination with Peg-IFN alfa-2a (Peg-IFN2a, 90 \u03bcg weekly) (n=159). Treatment was delivered at least 12 months or until treatment failure (disease progression) or major toxicity. The primary endpoint is the overall survival. Other endpoints are: rate and duration of hematologic and cytogenetic responses, major (MCyR) and complete (CCyR), molecular response (major molecular response ie MMR) and the tolerability. Using treatment allocation ratio 1.1.1.1 , randomization was stratified according to Sokal risk groups. The current interim analysis of the first 636 patients (\u03b1=0.85%, \u03b2=10%) at 1 year from randomization was planned in order to select the best experimental arm for further comparison with IM 400. The increased dose of IM or a combination regimen would be considered as promising if it increased the 4 log reduction response rate by at least 20 percentage points, e.g. from 15% to 35%, with an acceptable tolerability. Evaluation of molecular response up to 12 months was centralized, blinded and calculated according to International score (IS). Pts were recruited between 9/2003 and 10/2007.[median age 51 yrs (18\u201382), 62% of pts were male; Sokal distribution was low risk 33%, intermediate risk 41% and 27% high risk]. Median follow-up is 36 months (range 8\u201357) at the time of analysis. Overall, at 3 months 86 % of pts achieved complete hematologic response. The MCyR, CCyR and MMR rates at 6 and 12 months are:  . IM-400 . IM-600 . IM-Ara-c . IM-PegIFN . *p< 10 \u22122 (overall); ** p<10 \u22122 (overall) At 6 months (636 pts, ITT)     MCyR 74% 79% 68% 74% CCyR * 48%  67%  55%  56%  At 12months (562 evaluable pts)     MCyR 64% 76% 77% 74% CCyR  57%  65%  66%  71%  MMR at 6 months** 21% 33% 27% 39% MMR at 12 months 40% 52% 51% 61% . IM-400 . IM-600 . IM-Ara-c . IM-PegIFN . *p< 10 \u22122 (overall); ** p<10 \u22122 (overall) At 6 months (636 pts, ITT)     MCyR 74% 79% 68% 74% CCyR * 48%  67%  55%  56%  At 12months (562 evaluable pts)     MCyR 64% 76% 77% 74% CCyR  57%  65%  66%  71%  MMR at 6 months** 21% 33% 27% 39% MMR at 12 months 40% 52% 51% 61% View Large Interestingly the rate of MMR at 6 months was significantly higher for IM-PegIFN as compared with IM-400 (p<10 \u22123 ). The 4-log reduction rate in the BCR-ABL/ABL transcript were 18%, 21%, 22%, 34%, for the IM-400, IM-600, IM-Ara-c and IM-PegIFN arms respectively. The corresponding numbers of undetectable (complete molecular response) pts were 2%, 2%, 3% and 9% at 12 months respectively. Grade 3/4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia occurred in 8% of IM-400 pts, in 14% of IM-600 pts, in 41% of IMAra- c pts and in 40% of IM-PegIFN pts respectively. Grade 3/4 non hematological events were reported in 19% of IM-400 pts, in 30% of IM-600 pts, in 27% of IM Ara-c pts and in 31% of IM-PegIFN pts. Among them a relationship between treatment and event was suspected for 21 pts (13%) with IM-400 (7 liver toxicity; 7 oedema+muscle cramps), for 31 pts (19%) with IM-600 (7 liver toxicity, 11 oedema+ muscle cramps) for 36 pts (23%) with IM-Ara-c (2 liver toxicity; 10 gut side effect) and for 47 pts (29%) with IM-PegIFN (6 liver toxicity, 13 skin rash). Discontinuation of experimental treatment occurred within the first 6 and 12 months in 26% and 18% of IM-Ara-c pts and in 35% and 11% pts of IM-PegIFN pts respectively. Within the first 12 months 36% of 600-IM pts reduced their dosage. Although a substantial number of pts stopped PegIFN, this first analysis indicates the usefulness of a combination of IM-PegIFN for the initial treatment of pts with CML CP with a significant molecular response rate improvement. Complete analysis of the 636 pts with a follow-up of 12 months will be presented."
