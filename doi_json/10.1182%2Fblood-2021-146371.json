    "abstract_text": "Background: Pyruvate kinase muscle isoenzyme 2 (PKM2) is a key enzyme in aerobic glycolysis and thought to contribute to cancer cell metabolic reprogramming and regulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS). Doxorubicin has been showed to induced activated-B cell types diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) cells death by ROS accumulation. Our purpose was to evaluate whether PKM2 inhibition could enhance the sensitivity of doxorubicin in ABC-DLBCL. Methods: MTT assay was used to evaluate the proliferation of 2 ABC-DLBCL cell lines by treated with PKM2 inhibitor, PKM2 shRNA and doxorubicin. Apoptosis were detected by FCM after staining with Annexin V/SYTOX Green. Western Blot was used to evaluated the expression of PARP, Mcl1, Bcl2, Bax, Bim, p38 and JNK in ABC-DLBCL cells treated with PKM2 inhibition, PKM2 shRNA and doxorubicin. Results : PKM2 expression was found in both U2932 and SuDHL2 cell lines. Both PKM2 inhibitor and doxorubicin could inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis in ABC-DLBCL cell lines. PKM2 inhibitor could enhance the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. ShRNA was used to knock down the PKM2 expression in ABC-DLBCL cell lines and PKM2 KD cell lines were more sensitive to doxorubicin. PKM2 inhibition could increase the expression of cleaved PARP, Bax, Bim, p38 and JNK as well as decrease Mcl1 and Bcl2 expression Conclusions: PKM2 inhibition could sensitize ABC-DLBCL cell lines to the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin.
