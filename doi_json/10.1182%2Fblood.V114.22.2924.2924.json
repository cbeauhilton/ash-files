    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2924 Poster Board II-900 Introduction : Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is an enzyme that degrades the essential amino acid tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-g, induce IDO during the inflammatory response in many human cell types. The induction of IDO is synergistic in the presence of TNF-a, IL-1 or IL-6, and might be mediated by a signaling pathway from NF-\u03baB and/or MAPKs. Furthermore, some metabolites derived from tryptophan by IDO, such as L-kynurenine, block antigen-driven specific T-cell proliferation and induce T-cell death. Thus, IDO activity might play an important role in regulation of the immune response exerted by antigen presenting cells and also provide transformed cells with a potent tool to help escape from assault by the immune system. Indeed, we have previously reported that high serum L-kynurenine level is associated with poor prognosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (ASH 2008 abstract 2812). Here, we investigated the IDO expression of patients with DLBCL. Patients and methods : The study protocol comprised a prospective, consecutive entry design that was approved by our Institutional Review Board. We investigated 119 patients between December 2003 and June 2008 who were histologically diagnosed with DLBCL according to the WHO classification. We performed immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis for IDO expression by mouse anti-human IDO monoclonal antibody. Patients aged <70 y received 8 cycles of either R-CHOP or R-THP-COP therapy. Each regimen consisted of rituximab (R: 375 mg/m 2 ), cyclophosphamide (CPA: 750 mg/m 2 ), doxorubicin (DOX) or tetrahydropyranyl-adriamycin (THP; 50 mg/m 2 ), vincristine (VCR; 1.4 mg/m 2 , maximal dose 2.0 mg), and prednisolone (PSL; 100 mg daily). The R-THP-COP regimen included THP, an anthracycline derivative of DOX. Patients aged \u226570 y received 6 cycles of R-CHOP or R-THP-COP therapy. The chemotherapy cycles were repeated at 14-day intervals in patients aged <70 y, and at 21-day intervals in patients aged \u226570 y. Patients with bulky disease received radiotherapy ranging from 30 to 40 Gy. Responses to treatment were categorized as defined by Cheson et al. Results : The median age was 65.2 year (range, 24 - 88 y) and the median follow-up was 22.9 month (range, 0.60 \u2013 55.4 mo). The IDO expression patterns were classified into 3 categories; diffuse positive, focal positive and negative patterns. The diffuse positive IDO expression in tumor tissue was found in 38 cases (32%). The focal positive and negative expression of IDO was 16 cases (13.4%) and 65 cases (54.6%), respectively. The diffuse IDO positive cells were lymphoma cells and the focal IDO positive cells were dendritic cells (DC) confirmed by IHC analysis. The CR rates of patients with diffuse positive IDO expression, focal positive and negative were 55.3%, 62.5% and 83.1%, respectively (P<0.05). The 3-year overall survival rates for patients with diffuse positive, focal positive and negative were 49.8%, 66.3% and 81.4%, respectively (p=0.001). IDO expression was not significantly associated with the classification of germinal center (GC) type nor non-GC type. Discussion : A poor prognosis of patients with positive IDO expression might suggest that local immunity in tumor tissue is depressed by increasing L-kynurenine levels. Hence, IDO expression contributes to refractory to chemotherapy for DLBCL. Interestingly, expression pattern of IDO was significantly related with response to the treatment and prognosis of DLBCL. In conclusion, IDO activity might play an important role in DLBCL and the cells which express IDO are important for the response to treatment and prognosis of this malignancy. IDO, therefore, might be a candidate of therapeutic targets for DLBCL patients who are resistance to chemotherapy. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
