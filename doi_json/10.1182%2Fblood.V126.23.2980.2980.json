    "abstract_text": "The success of proteasome inhibition in multiple myeloma highlights the critical role for the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in this disease. However, there has been little progress in finding more specific targets within the UPS involved in myeloma pathogenesis. In an unbiased screen of de-ubiquitinase activity, we previously found the ubiquitin hydrolase UCH-L1 to be frequently over-expressed in B-cell malignancies, including myeloma. Using a transgenic mouse model, we also found that aberrant expression of UCH-L1 is sufficient to drive the development of spontaneous B-cell lymphomas and plasmacytomas, demonstrating its oncogenic activity. Whether and how UCH-L1 affects the clinical behavior of myeloma, however, is not known. Here we show that UCH-L1 is a potent negative prognostic factor that is essential for the dissemination and progression of myeloma. We found high levels of UCHL1 to predict early progression in newly diagnosed patients; a finding reversed in studies including bortezomib. We also found high UCHL1 levels to be a critical factor in the superiority of bortezomib over high-dose dexamethasone in relapsed patients. High UCHL1 partially overlaps with, but is distinct from, known genetic risks including 4p16 rearrangement and 1q21 amplification. Using an orthotopic mouse model, we found UCH-L1 depletion delays myeloma dissemination and causes regression of established disease. We conclude that UCH-L1 is a biomarker of aggressive myeloma that may be an important marker of bortezomib response, and may itself be an effective target in disseminated disease.
