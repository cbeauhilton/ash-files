    "abstract_text": "MERTK is a receptor tyrosine kinase of the TAM family (TYRO-3, AXL, MERTK) that is aberrantly expressed in 80-100% of pediatric and adult primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. MERTK inhibition mediated by small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), UNC2025 or MRX-2843, altered cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis in leukemia cell cultures. Moreover, treatment with these MERTK TKIs prolonged survival in mouse xenograft models of acute leukemia, but was not curative. In these models, treatment with the TKI effectively reduced peripheral disease burden but was less effective in the bone marrow, suggesting a role for the bone marrow microenvironment in therapeutic resistance. To evaluate the role of the bone marrow stromal niche in mediating resistance to MERTK inhibition by MRX-2843, AML cell lines were cultured in the presence of a fibroblast-like cell line (HS27) and induction of cell death and apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry after treatment with MRX-2843 or vehicle. Co-culture with the HS27 cell line significantly reduced cell death in Kasumi-1 AML cell cultures in response to treatment with 200nM MRX-2843 compared to leukemia cells alone (31.9% versus 61.2%, p<0.05). Similar results were observed in NOMO-1 and OCI-AML5 AML cell cultures. Additionally, cell cycle profiles were determined by flow cytometry in the presence or absence of stromal cells and MRX-2843. Treatment of Kasumi-1 cell cultures with 200nM MRX-2843 in the absence of stromal cells resulted in a significant accumulation of cells in G2 phase relative to vehicle-treated cultures (8.9% versus 14.8%, p<0.01) and was accompanied by an increase in \u03b3H2AX expression detected by immunoblot. In contrast, there was no change in cell cycle progression or \u03b3H2AX expression in cultures treated with MRX-2843 when co-cultured with the stromal cell line. NOMO-1 cells also accumulated in G2 phase in response to treatment with MRX-2843 and were protected from changes in cell cycle progression by co-culture with HS27 cells. Additionally, MERTK inhibition resulted in induction of polyploidy in NOMO-1 cell cultures, but this effect was abrogated in the presence of stromal cells. Collectively these results indicate abrogation of cell cycle progression in leukemia cells in response to treatment with MRX-2843 and demonstrate protection from this effect mediated by stromal cell interactions. The MERTK ligand, GAS6, mediates resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy in leukemia cells and is a poor prognostic marker in AML. To evaluate the role of the MERTK ligands GAS6 and PROS1 in resistance to MERTK inhibition, their expression in stromal cells was determined by immunoblot. GAS6, but not PROS1, was expressed in HS27 cells; however, MRX-2843 retained its ability to inhibit MERTK phosphorylation in stromal cell co-cultures. We hypothesized that upregulation of the other TAM kinases, AXL and/or TYRO3, may mediate resistance as they share common ligands. To test this hypothesis, Kasumi-1 cells were treated with UNC4241, a small molecule pan-TAM inhibitor, in the presence of stromal cells. While co-culture protected Kasumi-1 cells from MRX-2843 induced apoptosis, treatment with UNC4241 induced apoptosis in the presence of stromal cells (32.7% versus 20.4% in vehicle control, p<0.01). To further evaluate the interactions between stromal cells and leukemia cells, Kasumi-1 cells were cultured in HS27-conditioned medium in the presence or absence of MRX-2843. Conditioned medium was not sufficient to provide protection from MRX-2843 induced apoptosis (74.0% vs. 69.8% in unconditioned medium, p>0.05). Similarly, addition of 500nM exogenous GAS6 or PROS1 did not protect leukemia cells from apoptosis in the presence of MRX-2843. Together, these results suggest that direct cell-cell contact between leukemia and stromal cells is necessary to provide protection. Together these data support a model whereby direct cell-cell contact with stromal cells in the bone marrow niche protects leukemia cells from MRX-2843 induced apoptosis and cell cycle alterations and suggest that bone marrow mobilizing agents may be effective to overcome resistance to MERTK inhibitors.
