    "abstract_text": "Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes represent attractive therapeutic targets in multiple myeloma, but unfortunately non-selective HDAC inhibitors have led to dose-limiting toxicities in patients. ACY-1215 is a first generation, orally available HDAC inhibitor that is 11-fold selective for HDAC6, and synergizes in vitro and in vivo with bortezomib in preclinical models of MM without inducing unfavorable toxicities ( Blood , 20[210]: 4061). Ongoing Phase Ib clinical trials with ACY-1215 have thus far confirmed an exceptional safety and tolerability profile (Raje, et al , EHA, 2013). The IMiD class of drugs, including lenalidomide and pomalidomide, exhibit striking anti-myeloma properties in a variety of MM models, and have demonstrated significant clinical activity in MM patients. Prior studies have shown clinical activity of a combination of the non-selective HDAC inhibitor vorinostat with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in myeloma patients (Richter, et al , ASH, 2011). However, many patients experienced significant toxicities with this regimen that significantly limits its clinical utility. In support of our ongoing clinical development program for ACY-1215 in MM, we show here that combining ACY-1215 with either lenalidomide or pomalidomide leads to synergistic decreases in the viability of MM cells in vitro . The relevance of inhibition of HDAC6 to this synergistic effect was validated by demonstrating synergistic interactions of either IMiD molecule with ACY-775, which is more than 300-fold selective for HDAC6 over class I HDAC\u2019s. Further, the combination of ACY-1215, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone was well tolerated in vivo with no overt evidence of toxicity, and combination efficacy studies with this combination are now ongoing in models of MM. By demonstrating that a selective inhibitor of HDAC6 synergizes with IMiD\u2019s while maintaining an improved safety profile, these results provided a rational basis for the clinical development of the orally available combination of ACY-1215 and lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in an ongoing Phase Ib clinical trial (NCT01583283) for the treatment of MM.
