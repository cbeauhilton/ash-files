    "abstract_text": "Promising efficacy of bortezomib, the first therapeutic proteasome inhibitor, has been demonstrated in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). In this study, we evaluate the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions of bortezomib combination with epirubicin, dexamethasone and thalidomide (BADT) for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Using BADT regimen (bortezomib 1.0mg/m 2 on days 1, 4, 8 and 11; epirubicin 12mg/m 2 on days 1, 4, 8, 11; dexamethasone 20mg on days 1\u20132, 4\u20135, 8\u20139, 11\u201312; thalidomide 100mg/m 2 on days 1\u201328) for a maximum of eight 4-week cycles. 12 MM patients were treated, including 5 previously untreated patients and 7 previously treated patients. Each patient completed at least 2 cycles with a mean of 4.5 cycles. Of the 12 patients, 9 patients (75%) achieved complete remission (CR)and 2 patient (16.7%) achieved partial remission (PR), with an overall response (OR) of 91.5%. The mean number of cycles to CR was 2.8 (1\u20136), and the mean number of cycles to PR was 1.3 (1\u20133). 7 patients achieved PR after one cycle treatment, and 4 patients achieved CR after one cycle treatment. The main adverse reactions included peripheral neuropathy (4/12), thrombocytopenia (3/12), abnormal change of ECG (4/12), neutropenia (5/12), and liver function impairment (3/12), mainly grade \u00b1-II. Infection occurred in three patients with neutropenia, including sepsis in one patient and herpes zoster in another patient. One patient died of diseases progression, another patient died of secondly sarcoma after achievement CR. The median progression-free time was 14 months (2\u201326) months, including 2 patients who have been in CR for 15 months since discontinuation of the treatment. In Conclusion, the BADT regimen is highly effective with low toxicity in the treatment of MM. It is warranted to conduct further study on this regimen in more cases."
