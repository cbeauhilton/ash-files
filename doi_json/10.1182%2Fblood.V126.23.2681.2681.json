    "abstract_text": "Background: Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) comprise a heterogeneous group of relatively uncommon and generally aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Recent studies have begun to reveal their mutational landscape, such as the recurrent mutations affecting RHOA , IDH2 , and TET2 in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas (AITLs) and related PTCLs. Here, we studied the exomes of 63 PTCLs to address several unanswered questions: (1) How frequently do PTCLs have mutations with a strong rationale for being actionable using clinically available targeted therapies? (2) What pathways are enriched in PTCLs that could point to additional targeted therapies? (3) What additional recurrent mutations exist that may provide insight into PTCL pathogenesis and classification? Methods: We performed exome capture and sequencing in 63 frozen PTCL samples (with matched germline controls from 22), including 13 PTCLs, not otherwise specified; 6 AITLs; 37 anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs: 12 ALK+, 19 ALK-, and 6 cutaneous); 4 extranodal NK/T-cell lymphomas; 2 cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, and 1 enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma. Following primary variant calling, data were filtered by removing variants that were: outside the capture region, polymorphic (0.1% in ExAC), seen in paired germline or 50 healthy controls, within repetitive elements, or synonymous. Potentially actionable variants required published evidence for altering protein function and demonstrated in vivo or in vitro sensitivity to an available targeted agent (including open clinical trials). Mutated cancer genes (COSMIC) were examined for enrichment of KEGG canonical signaling pathways. A recurrent mutation encoding MSC E116K was validated in tumor DNA and MSC protein was examined by immunohistochemistry. Results: Of 25 unique variants with published evidence suggesting actionability (including ErbB, JAK/STAT, and RAS genes), at least one variant was present in 16/63 patients (25%). Variants in any COSMIC gene were seen in 55/63 samples (87%). Top genes were STAT3 , RHOA , ARID1A , MLL2 ( KMT2D ), PTPRB , TP53 , and TET2 . The KEGG ErbB pathway was most significantly enriched for mutated genes in our dataset ( EGFR , ERBB2 , ERBB3 , ERBB4 , and others; q=3.88x10 -3 ), followed by neurotrophin and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Among 25 recurrent non-synonymous variants, we identified MSC E116K with predicted gain-of-function exclusively in 3 ALK-ALCLs and 1 cutaneous ALCL. All mutated cases strongly expressed MSC protein. Among 96 cases, 13/18 ALK-ALCLs (72%) were positive for MSC, compared to 9/78 (12%) from other PTCL subtypes. Conclusions: Mutations that were potentially actionable based on published variant-specific data were identified in 25% of PTCLs, indicating promise for the role of sequencing in individualizing therapy. Additionally, remaining variants were enriched for several targetable pathways, most significantly ErbB. A novel recurrent mutation, MSC E116K, was seen exclusively in ALK-ALCLs (systemic and cutaneous). MSC protein, a repressor of E2A-mediated transcription of targets such as MYC , was expressed in most ALK- ALCLs and generally was absent in other PTCL subtypes. This finding extends evidence for a genetic relationship between systemic and cutaneous ALCLs and suggests MSC may help distinguish ALK- ALCLs from other PTCLs.
