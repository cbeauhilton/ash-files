    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable form of plasma cell cancer in which primary and secondary chromosomal translocations routinely juxtapose oncogenes to plasma cell-specific super-enhancers. Coincidentally, drugs which target super-enhancers have had success clinically. For example, immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs) degrade super-enhancer-binding pioneer factors IKAROS and AIOLOS, while glucocorticoids (Dexamethasone) and proteasome inhibitors (Bortezomib) have the ability to transrepress or block the processing of super-enhancer-forming NF-\u03baB proteins, respectively. Currently, alternative enhancer-targeting drugs are also in clinical development, like p300 inhibitors which target the acetyl-binding bromodomains and/or histone acetyl transferase activity of the chromatin-regulating coactivator homologs CBP and EP300. Despite showing therapeutic promise, our understanding of how these drugs function, alone or together, remains incomplete. Case in point, we find that IMiD-induced degradation of its target proteins IKAROS and AIOLOS does not guarantee a therapeutic response in vitro, and patients successfully treated with IMiDs eventually relapse; meanwhile, coactivator-targeting therapies like p300 inhibitors are often too toxic in vivo, and lack a therapeutic window. To improve the outcomes of MM patients we need to understand the heterogeneous genetics and transcription-factor milieus of the myeloma enhancer landscape, as well as how to increase the precision of enhancer-disrupting drugs. To accomplish this, our lab utilizes more than 60 human myeloma cell lines that have been extensively characterized at the genetic, proteomic, and drug-therapeutic-response levels. Additionally, we have generated a highly-predictive immunocompetent mouse model (Vk*MYC hCRBN+ ) that develops human-like MM and is sensitive to both IMiDs and a new class of therapeutics termed \"degronimids\" (normal mice do not respond to IMiDs or degronimids). Our central hypothesis is that combining a broad coactivator-targeting drug (e.g., the p300 inhibitor GNE-781), with a MM-specific transcription factor-targeting drug (e.g., IMiDs) restricts toxicities to myeloma cells and thus improves the therapeutic window. Currently, we are testing a variety of coactivator-targeting compounds alongside traditional IMiD therapies and other preclinical transcription factor-targeting drugs both in vivo and in vitro . We show that Vk*MYC hCRBN+ mice are exquisitely sensitive to GNE-781, requiring one fourth of the dose needed to treat other cancers and therefore avoiding the neutropenia and thrombocytopenia seen at higher doses. Second, we show that although IMiDs and GNE-781 induce an effective but transient response in vivo as single agents, the combination of the two drugs proved curative, with a progressive deepening of the anti-tumor response occurring even after therapy is discontinued. Ongoing experiments aim to determine how this drug combination, and other coactivator + transcription factor-targeting combinations, permanently disrupt myeloma-specific super-enhancers.
