    "abstract_text": "Introduction While core-binding factor acute myeloid leukaemia (CBF AML) as defined by t(8;21)(q22;q22) or inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22) has a favourable prognosis, 30-40% of patients still relapse after chemotherapy. Risk factors predictive for relapse include increasing age and white cell count (WCC), poor performance status and adverse-risk cytogenetics. Rising minimal residual disease (MRD) by molecular monitoring and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) mutations also predict higher risk of relapse (Yin et. al. , Blood 2012; Jourdan et. al. , Blood 2013). Aims 1. Identify prognostic markers for CBF AML 2. Determine significance of persistent molecular positivity in complete remission (CR) post-treatment Methods We undertook a retrospective audit from 2001-2012 at 4 tertiary-level hospitals. The inclusion criteria were adult patients >18 years with de novo CBF AML treated with at least intermediate dose cytarabine. Co-variates included in univariate analysis and then multivariate analysis if predictive of overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) included age, WCC, sex, cytogenetics, RTK mutations ( KIT and FLT3 ) and MRD ( RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or CBFB-MYH11 bone marrow (BM) qPCR post-induction (MRD1). Univariate analysis was also performed for BM MRD after each consolidation cycle 1-4 (MRD2-5 respectively). Results 70 patients were identified (Male=39, Female=31; inv(16)=30, t(8:21)=40). The median age at diagnosis was 43 years (range 17-73). There were 2 induction deaths and 68 achieved morphological CR. OS was 70.7% and RFS was 59.1% at a median follow-up of 31.4 months. There were 16 deaths (inv(16)=9, t(8;21)=7; median OS 14.8 months; 9 from relapsed AML, 4 treatment-related complications, 2 graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and 1 unrelated). 24 relapses (22 morphological, 2 molecular) occurred with a median RFS of 9 months (inv(16)=17, t(8;21)=7). RFS was significantly worse for inv(16) vs t(8;21) (39% vs 75%; p=0.0004). The inv(16) cohort had significantly higher median WCC of 33x10 9 /L vs 10.5x10 9 /L t(8;21). Univariate analysis identified age (p=0.032) and WCC>40 (p=0.002) as significant for inferior OS and RFS respectively. The impact of KIT (n=34, Pos=14, p=0.158) and FLT3 (n=27, Pos=2, p=0.152) mutations on OS/RFS were non-significant independent of CBF AML subtype. However, there were systematic differences in KIT and FLT3 data availability in the relapse vs non-relapse cohorts (Absent data: KIT 17/24(71%) vs 19/46(41%); FLT3 17/24(71%) vs 26/46(57%)). MRD analysis by qPCR at the different timepoints (MRD1=37, MRD2=24, MRD3=28, MRD4=23, MRD5=12) by < or \u22653 log reduction in comparison to pre-treatment values was not predictive of OS/RFS. On multivariate analysis excluding RTK mutations, age was the only significant predictor for OS (p=0.032) and WCC>40 for relapse (p=0.025). Standard vs intermediate/high-dose cytarabine in induction had no impact on OS/RFS but \u22653 consolidation cycles of intermediate-dose cytarabine improved OS vs \u22642 cycles (p=0.035). There was no significant difference in the median age of the cohorts receiving consolidation chemotherapy (\u22642: n=37, 47 years, \u22653: n=30, 35.5 years). Median BM qPCR values increased from 0 to 11% at relapse for inv(16) at a median duration of 4.3 months (range 1-8) and 0.05 to 178% for t(8;21) at 6 months (range 5-35) respectively. Of the 43 with durable CR, 28 maintained PB or BM qPCR values of 0-0.1% or 0.1% or >50 copy numbers; 5 were t(8;21) achieving PCR negativity at a range of 9-24 months post-completion of consolidation. Of the 24 who relapsed, 15 proceeded to stem cell transplant (13 allograft: inv(16)=8, t(8;21)=5; 2 autograft: inv(16)). There were 6 deaths in the allograft group (inv(16)=3, t(8;21)=3) and none in the autograft group. 3 deaths were related to relapsed disease post-allograft, 2 GVHD and 1 from non-GVHD complications. Conclusions Age is a significant predictor of OS in our CBF AML cohort while WCC is more predictive of relapse risk. The significance of RTK mutations and MRD is limited by data availability. \u22653 consolidation cycles of intermediate-dose cytarabine improved OS in comparison to fewer cycles. Stable low level MRD did not predict relapse. Regular monitoring of PB and BM qPCR values post-completion of treatment is necessary for prediction of subsequent relapse. Figure 1.
