    "abstract_text": "Background: In Swiss mountaineers, it was observed that they did not suffer from O 2 deficiency even in high altitude with diminished O 2 partial pressures, if they had taken gingko. In a pilot study with 11 metabolic syndrome patients, who received as therapy 2 \u00d7 120 mg/d Gingko biloba special extract EGb 761 (R\u00f6kan novo \u00d2 : Spitzner Arzneimittel, Ettlingen; Tebonin \u00d2 : Schwabe Pharmaceutical, Karlsruhe, Germany) over 2 months, it should be proven whether a change of the blood parameters MCH, MCHC, MCV and Hct could eventually supply a mechanistic explanation. Methods: Photometric methods, commercial ELISAs and EIAs, and clinical routine chemistry were applied. Results: MCH was increased from 27.7 \u00b1 0.9 to 28.6 \u00b1 1.0 pg ( p < 0.0003), a change of +3.2% ( p < 0.0044), MCHC from 317.7 \u00b1 2.5 to 333.0 \u00b1 3.1 g/L ( p < 0.0), a change of +4.8% ( p < 0.001), while Hct was decreased from 0.463 \u00b1 0.011 to 0.407 \u00b1 0.009 vol/vol ( p < 0.0), a change of -12.0% ( p < 0.001). Additionally, alterations in several biomarkers were measured: SOD +17.7% ( p < 0.009), oxLDL/LDL -21.0% ( p < 0.002), MPO -29.6% ( p < 0.013), hs-CRP -39.3% ( p < 0.004), HOMA-IR -14.0% ( p < 0.024), CREA -11.3% ( p < 0.001), ALT -16.0% ( p < 0.0208). The table demonstrates the results of a linear correlation analysis between these biomarker changes and the changes in Hct and MCHC showing calculated Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients r and error probabilities p . Discussion: Even though the additional load of the single erythrocyte with an increased hemoglobin concentration seems insignificant, it is, however, decisive for the O 2 -saturation of the blood. Decrease of the hematocrit from 46.3% to 40.7% signalizes a normalization of the initially elevated value in these metabolic syndrome patients. Possibly, this lowering by 12.0% would not have been so distinct in a normal person. Reduction of oxidative stress, inflammatory parameters as well as decrease in insulin resistance offer an explanation for the increase in MCH and MCHC. Conclusion: With the intake of ginkgo, a better O 2 -supply for organs and tissues is guaranteed not only through an increased blood perfusion but also through an improved load of the single erythrocyte with hemoglobin (MCHC) by 4.8% as well as through reduction of the hematocrit (Hct) by 12.0%.
