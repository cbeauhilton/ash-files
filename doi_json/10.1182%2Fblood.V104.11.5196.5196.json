    "abstract_text": "35 patients with acute myeloid leukemia have undergone transplantation at our institution over the past 12 years. Patient selection criteria included age less than 70 years, creatinine less than 2mg/ml, no active infection, cardiac ejection fraction >40%, DLCO > 50% of predicted and no other co-morbid conditions that would jeopardize survival. 31 patients were in first remission, 4 were in second or higher remission. 3 patients had favorable cytogenetics, 25 had intermediate or unfavorable cytogenetics. After achieving remission for at least 30 days, patients were consolidated with Etoposide and AraC, followed by G-CSF. Hematopoietic stem cells were collected when the WBC rebounded to at least 10,000/ml. The target dose of CD34 positive cells was 5x10 6 /kg. The minimum dose given was 2.3 x 10 6 /kg). The average age at transplantation was 41 years (range 22 to 61). Days of neutropenia (AGC<500/ml) ranged from 2 to 10 (average 5.1). The median length of follow up is 2.6 years. Currently 26 patients are alive, and 25 are free from progression. Overall survival is 63%, and progression-free survival is 47% at both 5 and ten years.
