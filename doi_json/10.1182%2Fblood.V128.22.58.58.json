    "abstract_text": "Introduction: CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor-modified (CAR) T cells have demonstrated considerable therapeutic efficacy in patients (pts) with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) B cell ALL (B-ALL), resulting in rapid and often durable complete responses (CR). In contrast, a smaller subset of pts with R/R CLL have achieved CR following CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy. Ibrutinib (IBR), which has considerable efficacy as a single agent in pts with R/R CLL, may modulate antitumor T cell immune responses. Others have observed enhanced ex vivo expansion of autologous T cells collected from pts with IBR exposure in response to CD3/CD28 bead stimulation, and improved CD19-targeted CAR T cell engraftment and antitumor efficacy in human xenograft models (Fraietta et al., Blood, 2016). Herein, we report on adults with CLL treated with IBR at the time of autologous T cell collection and/or around the time of CAR T cell infusion enrolled in our phase I clinical trial of CD19-targeted CAR T cells for adults with R/R CLL or B-cell NHL (NCT00466531). Methods: Eligible pts underwent leukapheresis and T cells were transduced with a retroviral vector encoding a CAR comprising a CD19-specific scFv and CD28 and CD3\u03b6 signaling domains (19-28z). The present analysis is limited to pts with CLL. We identified pts with CLL treated with IBR at the time of leukapheresis and/or around the time of conditioning chemotherapy (CCT) and CAR T cell infusion. As a control group, we additionally identified all evaluable IBR-na\u00efve pts with CLL treated on this study. Response was assessed by NCI-WG criteria. Cytokine levels were measured prospectively before and after CCT and CAR T cell infusion. Results: 5 pts (male, n=3), median age 58 at CAR T cell infusion (range, 43-66) with R/R CLL (TP53 loss, n=2) underwent therapy with IBR at leukapheresis (n=4) and/or immediately prior to or through CCT (cyclophosphamide [Cy], n=2; fludarabine [Flu]+Cy, n=3) and CAR T cell infusion (n=5). 6 additional evaluable pts with R/R CLL remained IBR-na\u00efve through CCT (Cy, n=4; bendamustine, n=2) and CAR T cell infusion. A non-significant trend toward greater median cumulative fold T cell expansion ex vivo was noted in the 4 pts on IBR (vs the 7 not on IBR) at leukapheresis (374 [171-1518] vs 160 [49-468], p=0.13), with similar median manufacturing time (13.5 vs 15 days). End of process (EOP) T cells in pts undergoing collection while on IBR (vs those not on IBR) demonstrated a greater fraction of CD8 + CAR + T cells with a CD62L + CD127 + (central memory) phenotype (mean 29.0 vs 4.3%, p=0.10) and decreased fraction of CD62L - T cells (effector/effector memory phenotype) across CD8 + CAR + (mean 26.5 vs 54.4%, p=0.06) and CD4 + CAR + (mean 24.0 vs 57.8%, p=0.03) T cell subsets ( Fig 1 ). IBR-treated pts received median 1x10 7 19-28z + CAR T cells/kg (3x10 6 -3x10 7 /kg) and IBR-na\u00efve pts received median 1x10 7 19-28z + CAR T cells/kg (6x10 6 -4x10 7 /kg). Fevers developed in all 11 pts and began on the first day of infusion in 4/5 IBR-treated pts (vs 2/6 IBR-na\u00efve pts); 2/5 IBR-treated pts (vs 0/6 IBR- na\u00efve pts) developed severe CRS and required vasopressors for hypotension in addition to tocilizumab. IBR-treated pts additionally exhibited greater median peak levels of multiple immunoregulatory cytokines associated with CRS, including IL-6, IL-10, IL-2, IL-5, IFN-\u03b3, FLT3L, fractalkine, and GM-CSF. In total, 5 of 11 enrolled pts with CLL (45%) treated with CCT and 19-28z CAR T cells achieved objective response (minimal residual disease [MRD]- CR, n=2; maintenance of MRD+ CR, n=1; PR, n=2); ORR was 4/5 among IBR-treated pts (1 MRD- CR, 1 MRD+ CR, 2 PR; p=0.08 for ORR between IBR-treated vs IBR-na\u00efve pts). 2 pts remain in MRD- CR at 16 and 50 months. Maximal CAR T cell persistence observed to date is 159 days; peak vector copy levels by qPCR were highest in the 2 pts attaining MRD-negative CR. Conclusions : Prior therapy with IBR may influence EOP CAR T cell phenotypes. Prior \u00b1 concurrent IBR may improve antitumor responses following 19-28z CAR T cell administration, though small numbers of pts and differences in CCT regimens limit firm conclusions based on these data. Additionally, prior \u00b1 concurrent IBR may amplify CRS, though more intensive CCT (e.g. Flu/Cy vs Cy) may also enhance CAR T cell expansion in vivo and intensify CRS. Further strategies to overcome the inhibitory microenvironment and enhance CAR T cell expansion and efficacy in pts with R/R CLL are in preparation.
