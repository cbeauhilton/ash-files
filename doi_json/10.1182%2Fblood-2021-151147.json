    "abstract_text": "Introduction: SETD2 is the only known histone methyltransferase (HMT) capable of catalyzing H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) in vivo. It plays an important role in several biological processes including B cell development and maturation, leading to the hypothesis that SETD2 inhibition in these settings could provide anti-tumor effects. The normal process of B cell development/maturation renders B cells susceptible to genetic vulnerabilities that can result in a dysregulated epigenome and tumorigenesis, including in multiple myeloma (MM) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). For example, 15%-20% of MM harbors the high risk (4;14) chromosomal translocation, resulting in high expression of the multiple myeloma SET domain (MMSET) gene. MMSET is an HMT that catalyzes H3K36me1 and H3K36me2 formation and extensive scientific work has established overexpressed MMSET as a key factor in t(4;14) myeloma pathogenesis. To the best of our knowledge MMSET has eluded drug discovery efforts, however, since t(4;14) results in high levels of the H3K36me2 substrate for SETD2, inhibiting SETD2 offers promise for targeting the underlying oncogenic mechanism driven by MMSET overexpression in t(4;14) MM patients. In addition, SETD2 loss of function mutations described to date in leukemia and DLBCL are always heterozygous, suggesting a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor role for SETD2. This observation points to a key role for SETD2 in leukemia and lymphoma biology and suggests that therapeutic potential of SETD2 inhibition may also exist in these or similar settings. EZM0414 is a first-in-class, potent, selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of SETD2. We explored the anti-tumor effects of SETD2 inhibition with EZM0414 in MM and DLBCL preclinical studies to validate its potential as a therapy in these tumor types. Methods: Cellular proliferation assays determined IC 50 values of EZM0414 in MM and DLBCL cell line panels. Cell line-derived xenograft preclinical models of MM and DLBCL were evaluated for tumor growth inhibition (TGI) in response to EZM0414. H3K36me3 levels were determined by western blot analysis to evaluate target engagement. Combinatorial potential of SETD2 inhibition with MM and DLBCL standard of care (SOC) agents was evaluated in 7-day cotreatment in vitro cellular assays. Results: Inhibition of SETD2 by EZM0414 results in potent anti-proliferative effects in a panel of MM and DLBCL cell lines. EZM0414 inhibited proliferation in both t(4;14) and non-t(4;14) MM cell lines, with higher anti-proliferative activity generally observed in the t(4;14) subset of MM cell lines. The median IC 50 value for EZM0414 in t(4;14) cell lines was 0.24 \u03bcM as compared to 1.2 \u03bcM for non-t(4;14) MM cell lines. Additionally, inhibitory growth effects on DLBCL cell lines demonstrated a wide range of sensitivity with IC 50 values from 0.023 \u03bcM to >10 \u03bcM. EZM0414 resulted in statistically significant potent antitumor activity compared to the vehicle control in three MM and four DLBCL cell line-derived xenograft models. In the t(4;14) MM cell line-derived xenograft model, KMS-11, robust tumor growth regressions were observed at the top two doses with maximal TGI of 95%. In addition, two non-t(4;14) MM (RPMI-8226, MM.1S) and two DLBCL xenograft models (TMD8, KARPAS422) demonstrated > 75% TGI; with two additional DLBCL models (WSU-DLCL2, SU-DHL-10) exhibiting > 50% TGI in response to EZM0414. In all models tested, the antitumor effects observed correlated with reductions in intratumoral H3K36me3 levels demonstrating on-target inhibition of SETD2 methyltransferase activity in vivo. In vitro synergistic antiproliferative activity was also observed when EZM0414 was combined with certain SOC agents for MM and DLBCL. Conclusions: Targeting SETD2 with a small molecule inhibitor results in significantly reduced growth of t(4;14) MM, as well as non-t(4;14) MM and DLBCL cell lines, in both in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies. In addition, in vitro synergy was observed with EZM0414 and certain SOC agents commonly used in MM and DLBCL, supporting the combination of SETD2 inhibition with current MM and DLBCL therapies. This work provides the rationale for targeting SETD2 in B cell malignancies such as MM, especially t(4;14) MM, as well as DLBCL, and forms the basis for conducting Phase 1/1b clinical studies to evaluate the safety and activity of EZM0414 in patients with R/R MM and DLBCL.
