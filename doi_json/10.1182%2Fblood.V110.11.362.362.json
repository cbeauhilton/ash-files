    "abstract_text": "The WT1 gene on chromosome 11p13 encodes a zinc-finger protein regulating gene transcription. A recent study conducted on 70 CN-AML patients (pts) found that 7 (10%) harbored WT1 mutations ( WT1 mut) and suggested that WT1 mut are associated with failure to achieve complete remission (CR) ( Summers et al., Leukemia  2007 ; 21 : 550 ). However, the prognostic impact of WT1 mut remains to be elucidated in a larger set of homogeneously treated adults with de novo CN-AML and in the context of established prognostic molecular markers. We studied the prevalence and prognostic impact of WT1 mut in 196 younger [<60 years (yrs)] adults with de novo CN-AML who were intensively treated on frontline CALGB protocols incorporating autologous stem cell transplantation for consolidation, i.e. 9621 or 19808. The median follow-up for pts alive was 4.2 yrs (range, 1.2\u20138.9 yrs). Diagnostic bone marrow and/or blood specimens were studied for WT1 mut by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and DNA direct sequencing. The samples were also analyzed for FLT3- ITD, FLT3 -TKD, MLL -PTD, NPM1 and CEBPA mutations, and ERG and BAALC expression levels. Twenty-one (11%) of the 196 pts had WT1 mut [15 had WT1 mut in exon 7 ( WT1 mut7), 5 WT1 mut in exon 9 ( WT1 mut9) and 1 WT1 mut in both exons]. WT1 mut7 were frameshift or nonsense mutations predicted to result in a truncated WT1 protein; WT1 mut9 were missense mutations leading to single amino-acid substitutions. At diagnosis, WT1 mut pts had higher white blood cell counts (WBC; P =0.01), more frequently harbored FLT3 -ITD (P=0.06) and were more often high ERG ( P =0.01) and high BAALC (P=0.006) expressers than unmutated WT1 ( WT1 wt) pts. While CR rates were not significantly different between WT1 mut and WT1 wt pts (76% vs 84%, P =0.36), WT1 mut pts had worse disease-free survival [(DFS); P <0.001; 3-yr DFS rates, 13% vs 50%; Figure A] and worse overall survival [(OS); P <0.001; 3-yr OS rates, 10% vs 56%; Figure B] than WT1 wt pts. In a multivariable analysis, WT1 mut independently predicted worse DFS ( P =0.009) when controlling for CEBPA ( CEBPA mut vs CEBPA wt, P =0.005) and FLT3 -ITD/ NPM1 risk status ( FLT3 -ITD-negative and NPM1 mut vs all other combinations of FLT3 -ITD and NPM1 mutation status, P <0.001). The risk of relapse was 2.9 times higher for WT1 mut pts than for WT1 wt pts (95% CI: 1.3\u20136.3). WT1 mut also independently predicted worse OS ( P <0.001), and conferred a 3.6 times higher risk of death compared with WT1 wt pts (95% CI: 1.8\u20137.2), when controlling for CEBPA ( P =0.02), FLT3 -ITD/ NPM1 risk status ( P <0.001), and WBC ( P =0.01). In conclusion, we show here for the first time, in a relatively large set of intensively treated younger CN-AML pts, that WT1 mut independently predicts very poor outcome. We propose that in future trials, WT1 mut analysis should be considered for molecularly-based risk assessment and risk-adapted treatment stratification of CN-AML pts.
