    "abstract_text": "Background : HL, independently of socio economic conditions, is often intrinsically more aggressive in developing countries, including in Tunisia (Tunis Med.1999 77:614). We evaluated clinical characteristics and outcome of HL pts included in a prospective multicenter Tunisian adult HL trial. Methods: Between 2002 and 2006, 251 consecutive eligible pts from 6 Tunisian departments with newly diagnosed HL were enrolled in a prospective trial (MDH 2002). Pts were staged using EORTC prognostic factors in early stages and the international prognostic scoring (IPS) in advanced stages. ABVD was used at 3 cycles for favorable (fav) early stages (G1), 6 cycles for unfavorable (unfav) early stages (G2) and stage IIIA (G3) and 8 cycles for fav advanced stages (IPS <3) (G5). Involved field RT was combined to chemotherapy (CT) for early stage and stage IIIA. Intensive CT (4 escalated BEACOPP + 4 standard BEACOPP) was used for unfav advanced stages (IPS 3 3): (G4). G-CSF was given after each escalated BEACOPP course Refractory and relapsed pts were proposed for intensive CT and autologous SCT. Closing date of the study was Dec 2007 Results: Median age at presentation was 31 years (range 15\u201370), with 140 M and 111 F. 50% patients had advanced disease (28% with stage IV) and 44% had unfav early stage (G2). 25% pts had Bulky mediastinal disease and 69% had B symptoms. 40% pts were treated in G2, 29% in G4, 17% in G5 and only 9% in G1. Eleven (4.3%) toxic deaths were observed during treatment, including 10 deaths in the 72 pts treated with escalated BEACOPP. Of the remaining pts, 83% had CR and 17% had primary failure at the end of the planned treatment (including 14 % with response 50 % to 75% response and with <50% response, respectively Conclusions: This study confirms the high incidence of aggressive forms of HD in Tunisia, therefore frequently requiring intensive treatment, sometimes difficult to apply in pts with relatively low socio economic condition Apart from escalated BEACOPP (which resulted in high toxicity that will have in the future to be better prevented), treatments could however generally be administered completely, which possibly contributed to the relatively few relapses. Bulky mediastinal disease and absence of CR at the end of treatment were, as in other countries, major issues requiring treatment intensification"
