    "abstract_text": "Introduction Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) transplantation is an established platform of immunotherapy for lymphoma due to the graft-vs.-lymphoma (GVLy) effect. The objective of this study was to determine if GVLy was associated with acute (aGVHD) or chronic GVHD (cGVHD) in B cell and T cell lymphomas, and to analyze whether this effect differs in myeloablative and RIC transplants. Methods Inclusion criteria were patients older than 18 years undergoing HLA-identical sibling or unrelated donor HSCT between 1997 and 2009, with diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), peripheral T cell lymphoma (T-NHL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Twin transplants, cord blood, and ex vivo T-cell depletion cases were excluded. The effect of aGVHD and cGVHD on relapse/progression in each subtype of lymphoma, and by conditioning regimen (myeloablative vs RIC) was analyzed in a multivariate analysis. Results 2611 cases were included (HL, n=466; DLBCL, n=579; FL, n=871; T-NHL, n=195; MCL, n=500). 56% of transplants were from unrelated donors (37% matched and 18% partially matched/mismatched). RIC conditioning regimen was used in 63% (n=1641), and the graft source was peripheral blood stem cells (PB) in 77% (n=2002). Some characteristics of the patients and results of the univariate analysis of clinical outcomes are shown in Table 1 . In multivariate analysis, aGVHD II-IV was associated with a lower risk of relapse/progression in FL (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.27-0.94; p=0.031), and cGVHD was associated with a lower risk of relapse/progression in MCL (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.18-0.61; p<0.001). There was no significant association of either aGVHD or cGVHD with risk of relapse/progression in HL, T-NHL and DLBCL. aGVHD was associated with a higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) in all disease subtypes and with a worse progression free survival (PFS) in MCL, FL, and DLBCL. cGVHD was associated with a higher NRM and inferior PFS in FL and DLBCL. When all myeloablative cases (n=954) were analyzed per lymphoma subtype in the multivariate analysis, neither aGVHD nor cGVHD were associated with a lower incidence of relapse/progression. In contrast, when RIC cases (n=1641) were analyzed together in the multivariate analysis, both aGVHD and cGVHD were associated with a lower incidence of relapse/progression in FL (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.14-0.75; p=0.01, and RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.15-0.90, respectively), and cGVHD was associated with a lower incidence of relapse/progression in MCL (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.16-0.62; p<0.001).

However, development of GVHD did not translate into an improvement of survival or PFS in these subtypes of lymphoma due to excess NRM. The relation of GVHD with a lower relapse/progression rate seems to be more prominent in RIC transplants than in myeloablative transplants.
