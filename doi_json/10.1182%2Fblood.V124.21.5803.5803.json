    "abstract_text": "Introduction Recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) such as filgrastin (Neupogen\u00d2) is widely used to mobilize peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in healthy donors prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (all-SCT). In comparison to the bone marrow harvest, the G-CSF mobilized graft has a higher content of donor-derived T cells, the primary mediators of acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD). However, the incidence of aGvHD is identical suggesting a modulatory effect of Neupogen on T cells. The differentiation of allo-T cells to a T-helper 1 (Th1) phenotype polarizes the cells to produce IFN-g and IL-2, and this in turn promotes the development of GvHD. Conversely, recent evidence suggests that T-helper 2 (Th2) cells that produce IL-4 and IL-10 protects against GvHD. In healthy donors, G-CSF (Neupogen\u00d2) has been shown to decrease IFN-g and increase IL-4 production. A finding that is also observed under specific stimulatory condition in vitro . The recent patent expiry on G-CSF (Neupogen\u00ae) has prompted the development of alternative forms of G-CSF \u2013 called biosimilars. These molecules are structurally equivalent but their biological mode of action is currently under review. However, biosimilar G-CSF has not been accepted for routine stem cell mobilization in healthy donors primarily due to a lack of data about their safety in this cohort. In addition, no data exists of their influence on T cell modulation, which will potentially have a significant effect on aGvHD in the recipient. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro effects of Nivestim\u00ae, a biosimilar G-CSF that has been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia, and compared to the reference product filgrastim (Neupogen\u00ae) on human CD4 + T cells obtained from healthy volunteers. Results PBMC from 10 healthy volunteers, were cultured in the presence of Nivestim\u00ae or Neupogen\u00ae (both at 100 ng/ml), and stimulated 24 hrs later with either (1) anti-CD3 MoAb; (2) Phytohaemagglutin (PHA) or (3) PMA plus Ionomycin. The effects of Nivestim\u00ae and Neupogen\u00ae were examined on Th1 and Th2 cytokine profiles (IFN-g and IL-4 respectively), Th-specific transcriptional regulators, and T cell proliferation and survival. Our findings showed that CD4 + T cells from PBMC cultures produced significant levels of IFN-g following T cell activation. However, in the presence of Nivestim\u00ae or Neupogen\u00ae, the production of IFN-g was notably reduced and IL-4 levels were increased. These findings were consistent regardless of whether the T cell receptor was stimulated directly, or by-passed through the activation of proximal signaling molecules. Conclusion Whilst this pattern of Th2 polarization was not observed for all healthy volunteers, the biological effects of Nivestim\u00ae was comparable to Neupogen\u00ae in all cases. These findings have established that Nivestim\u00ae has an immunomodulatory effect on Th1/Th2 polarization in vitro that is equivalent to the reference product Neupogen\u00ae. Our findings will assist in facilitating Nivestim\u2019s use for stem cell mobilization in healthy donors. Disclosures Mifsud: Hospira: Research Funding.
