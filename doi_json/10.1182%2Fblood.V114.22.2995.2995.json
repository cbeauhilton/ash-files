VWF conformational changes in response to high shear stress are thought to be critical for initiating platelet adhesion, there is increasing evidences indicate that the interactions of intraplatelet proteins 14-3-3\u03b6 and filamin A with the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbalpha also play key roles in the regulation of VWF binding function of GPIb-IX, whereas it is unclear whether their structural linkage has functional implication. This study was to explore the mechanism underlying the roles of 14-3-3\u03b6 and filamin A in the regulation of the VWF binding function of GPIb-IX. Methods and Results: A truncation mutant of GPIbalpha (at residue 565) deleting the C-terminal 14-3-3\u03b6 binding sites retains 14-3-3\u03b6 binding function, in contrast, deletion of the C-terminal residues 551-610 of GPIbalpha totally abolished 14-3-3\u03b6 binding, indicating that the residues 551-564 of GPIbalpha is important in the interaction between 14-3-3\u03b6 and GPIb-IX. An antibody recognizing phosphorylated R557GpSLP561 sequence reacted with GPIbalpha suggesting phosphorylation of a population of GPIbalpha molecules at Ser559, and a membrane permeable phosphopeptide (MP-P), M-R557GpSLP561 corresponding to residues 557-561 of GPIbalpha eliminated the association of 14-3-3\u03b6 with the truncation mutant of GPIbalpha . MP-P also promoted GPIb-IX association with the membrane skeleton, and inhibited ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination, VWF binding to platelets and platelet adhesion to immobilized VWF. Furthermore, a GPIb-IX mutant replacing Ser 559 of GPIbalpha with alanine showed an enhanced association with the membrane skeleton, reduced ristocetin-induced VWF binding and diminished ability to mediate cell adhesion to VWF under flow conditions. Conclusions: These data suggest a phosphorylation-dependent binding of 14-3-3\u03b6 to central filamin A binding site of GPIbalpha, and the dimeric 14-3-3\u03b6 binding to both the C-terminal site and central RGpSLP site inhibits GPIb-IX association with the membrane skeleton and promotes the VWF binding function of GPIb-IX.
