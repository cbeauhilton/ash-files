    "abstract_text": "Inducible costimulator (ICOS) is a member of the B7 family that is expressed on activated and memory T cells and is involved in the regulation of TH1 and TH2 effector cytokine production after CD3/TCR stimulation. Studies with ICOS inhibition or ICOS\u2212/\u2212 recipients have demonstrated prolonged allograft survival after heart or liver transplantation in animal models. To study the role of ICOS expression on alloreactive T cells in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), we used allogeneic MHC class I and II disparate hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) models. We first analyzed the expression of ICOS by transferring CFSE-labeled donor T cells into irradiated allogeneic recipients and observed an increased expression of ICOS on alloreactive T cells compared to non-alloreactive T cells. We then studied B6-ICOS\u2212/\u2212 alloreactive T cells and found intact proliferation in vivo (as determined by adoptive transfer of CFSE labeled T cells and donor T cell numbers in the spleen of allo-HSCT recipients), intact cytotoxicity, intact up regulation of activation markers, but decreased IFN-\u03b3 production in vitro. We then performed GVHD experiments in two models with full MHC class I and II disparity and observed significantly less GVHD morbidity and mortality in recipients of ICOS\u2212/\u2212 donor T cells. Furthermore, histopathological analysis demonstrated less GVHD in all target organs (skin, liver, small bowel and large bowel) of recipients of ICOS\u2212/\u2212 splenic T cells compared to recipients of wild type T cells. We harvested target organs (spleen, thymus, liver and gut) on days 7, 14, and 21 to examine donor T cell content (nai\u0308ve and activated T cells) and found no significant difference in the total T cell numbers and subpopulations. Interestingly, in GVHD/graft-versus-tumor (GVT) experiments, ICOS\u2212/\u2212 donor T cells displayed intact GVT activity, while their GVH activity was diminished. We then tested the levels of IFN-\u03b3 in the sera of mice undergoing GVHD and observed decreased serum levels in recipients of B6-ICOS\u2212/\u2212 T cells. In conclusion, alloreactive ICOS\u2212/\u2212 donor T cells display less GVHD morbidity and mortality due to decreased IFN-\u03b3 production, while proliferation, infiltration and GVT activity remain intact. These data suggests that strategies to inhibit ICOS could be useful for the prevention and/or treatment of GVHD in recipients of an allo-HSCT.",
