    "abstract_text": "The 1q21 amplification, which occurs in approximately 40% of de novo and 70% of relapsed MM, is among the most frequent chromosomal aberrations in multiple myeloma (MM) patients and is considered a very high-risk genetic feature that is especially correlated with disease progression and drug resistance. To uncover novel 1q21 MM-critical genes, we first identified a list of 78 potential 1q21 drivers, which were located in the minimal common region of amplification of 254 MM samples and showed copy number-driven expression. These 78 candidates were then subjected to an shRNA screen to identify those genes involved in selective death and/or growth inhibition of MM cells carrying the 1q21 amplification. Using this approach, we identified and functionally validated the Interleukin-2 enhancer binding factor 2 (ILF2) as one of key 1q21 amplification-specific genes. ILF2 downregulation in 1q21-amplified MM cells resulted in multinucleated phenotypes and abnormal nuclear morphologies, findings that are consistent with the DNA damage-induced genomic instability that is associated with DNA repair defects that occur during cellular replication. Correspondingly, ILF2 downregulation was associated with a significant increase in the activation of the ATM (but not ATR or DNA-PK) pathway and accumulation of gH2AX foci, which are indicative of double-strand DNA breaks, and resulted in caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, we sought to determine whether ILF2 is involved in the genome damage repair that occurs during cellular replication. To this end, we evaluated whether ILF2 depletion could affect the efficiency of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR), the two major repair pathways in mammalian cells. We observed a profound impairment of HR in ILF2 -depleted cells (p=0.038), whereas NHEJ was unaltered after ILF2 downregulation. Conversely, enforced ILF2 expression significantly enhanced HR efficiency in MM cells (p=0.008). To further support the role of ILF2 in the regulation of the DNA repair pathway in MM cells, we evaluated whether ILF2 downregulation increased MM sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents routinely used in the treatment of MM. Employing the interstrand crosslinker melphalan as an instigator of double-strand DNA breaks, we found that ILF2 -depleted MM cells subjected to continuous melphalan treatment showed increased accumulation of \u03b3H2AX and apoptosis. Consistent with these findings, elevated ILF2 expression significantly correlated with poor survival in MM patients treated with high-dose melphalan followed by tandem autologous transplantation (n=256, p=0.01). Mechanistically, mass spectrometry analysis showed that ILF2 interacted with numerous RNA binding proteins directly involved in the regulation of DNA damage response by modulating alternative splicing of specific pre-mRNAs. RNA-sequencing experiments confirmed that ILF2 depletion resulted in aberrant splicing of genes involved in the DNA repair pathway, including ERCC1, FANCD2, and EXO1. RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing experiments showed that ILF2 directly bound to transcripts involved in the regulation of the HR pathway, including components of BRCA1 protein complex. Furthermore, in an attempt to dissect the ILF2 protein interacting network involved in the DNA repair regulation in response to DNA damage activation, we found that ILF2 mediated drug resistance in a dose-dependent manner by modulating YB-1 nuclear localization and interaction with the splicing factor U2AF65 to promote mRNA processing and stabilization of DNA repair genes, including FANCD2 and EXO1, in response to DNA damage. In conclusion, our study reveals an intimate relationship among 1q21 amplification, mRNA splicing, and DNA repair in the control of DNA damage response in MM. Given that 1q21 amplification is one of the most frequent copy number alterations in cancer, synthetic lethality approaches based on targeting gain-of-functions associated with ILF2 may have a broad spectrum of applications to potentiate the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents.
