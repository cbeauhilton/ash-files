    "abstract_text": "Background: Prior studies have indicated that transfusion is unusual (2%) in pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia. Nonetheless, compliance with oral iron replacement can be an issue and physicians may wish to use IV iron therapy in markedly anemic pregnant women. Objectives: to evaluate the effectiveness of adding intravenous iron sucrose concentrate (ISC) to pregnant patients already taking oral iron in terms of effect on hemoglobin, effect on ferritin levels, rates of transfusion, and cost. Methods: We analyzed all referrals from Obstetrics to Hematology clinic and Obstetrics consultation (Internal medicine) clinic from January 2014 to June 2016. Of the 176 pregnant patients, 98 were referred for anemia, including 81 patients with Hgb < 12 g/dl and ferritin < 20 ug/L. All had previously been given oral ferrous sulfate prescriptions. Patients with hemoglobinopathy were excluded. All 81 patients were advised to continue on the oral iron, and 40 were given IV iron sucrose (ISC group). Results: The average cumulative dose of iron sucrose was 700 mg, a mean of 5.575 doses (initiated in the third trimester in 38 of 40 patients). The lowest antepartum Hgb was 8.18 g/dl in the ISC group and 9.58 in the oral only group; there was an average Hgb increase of 2.17 vs 1.76 g/dl respectively (p=.107 NS and the 0.41 g/dl difference was considered to be of no clinical consequence). 89% in the ISC group vs 30% in the oral achieved a ferritin >20 (p=0.000015). No adverse events in the IV iron group were reported. There was 1 transfusion in the oral iron group attributable to iron deficiency (2.4%) vs none in the IV iron group (p = 0.107 NS). Two patients were transfused in the antenatal period before IV iron was started and 1 transfused because of post-partum hemorrhage. The total cost of the IV iron therapy would add an average of $1,500 per patient. Thus, and additional cost of $60,000 in IV iron would be required to prevent 1 transfusion [40:1]. Conclusions: ISC corrects ferritin in more patients than oral iron replacement, but did not significantly increase Hgb levels or have a meaningful impact on the transfusion rate. The additional cost and lack of clinically improved outcomes with IV iron argue against its use and in favor of strategies to ensure compliance with oral iron.
