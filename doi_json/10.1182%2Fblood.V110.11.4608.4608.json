    "abstract_text": "Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) represents a heterogenous group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by abnormal differentiation and maturation of myeloid cells, bone marrow failure and genetic instability. The recent clinical and laboratory investigations suggest that MDS is closely related to diseases in which the bone marrow failure is mediated at least in part by the immune system. The are few studies concerning the of efficacy of treatment of MDS pts with cyclosporine A (CSA) but they are limited to the group of pts with bone marrow hypoplasia. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of CSA treatment in MDS pts as first line or second line therapy. 48 pts with different forms of MDS were included in study. The group of first line CSA treatment included 30 pts, male-18/female-12, RA-3, RARS-1, RCMD-18, RAEB-7, RAEBt-1, 20-normal karyotype, 10-different abberations including: 5q\u2212, 16q+, \u22127, 12q+, \u2212Y, [11p+,7q\u2212] and complex abb. Hypoplastic bone marrow was revealed in 15 pts, hyperplastic-8 pts, hypo/hyper-7 pts. Second line therapy group included 18 pts, male-9/female-9, RCMD-11, RARS-1, RAEB-5, RAEBt-1, normal karyotype-3, cytogenetic anomalies-13 (+8, 5q\u2212,\u22127, +8 and complex abb.). Hypoplastic bone marrow was revealed in 12 pts, hyperplastic-4 pts, hypo/hyper-4 pts. The first line therapy consited of splenectomy in 8 pts, low doses of Ara-C-3, interferon-\u03b1-3, chemotherapy-2 and ATG-2 pts. CSA was applied at 5\u201310 mg/kg/day initially and then adjusted according to blood levels and toxicity. The maintenance dose was 1\u20133 mg/kg/day. Minimum time to response evaluation was one month. Complete response (CR) was defined as normal PB counts, BM aspirate; partial response-improvement of PB counts to 50% of normal and freedom from transfusions; stabilization-decrease of transfusion requirements and stabilization of PB counts for more then 1 month. Total response rate in first group was 60% (18 pts) with median follow up of 10 months (2\u2013134). CR was estimated in 20% (6pts), median follow-up 72 months (44\u2013134). 2 pts with CR are in clonal remission. 2 pts from response group developed acute leukemia (AL). 40% of pts showed no response.58% of pts without response developed RAEB or AL. 42% of pts were in stable disease and were treated with another modalities. The response rate in second group was 61% (11 pts) with median follow-up of 7 months (1\u201378). 22% (4 pts) achieved CR, median follow-up 60 months (43\u201378). 39% of pts showed no response. 71% from these pts (5) transformed to RAEB or AL. 2 pts remained in stable disease. In both groups response was registrated from 1 to 4 months from treatment initiation (median 3 months). CR was achieved in the majority of pts after 1 year of treatment. Response was achieved in 77% of pts with hypo/hyper and hypoplastic bone marrow and in 12% of pts with hyperplastic bone marrow. Overall survival was decreased in pts with more the 5% blasts in bone marrow (p=0,02 for 1 st line group, p=0,075 for 2 nd line group), and increased for pts with hypo and hypo/hyper bone marrow cellularity (p=0,002 for 1 st line group). There was no impact of cytogenetics. We may conclude, that CSA demonstrates good efficacy in therapy of MDS pts, especially for pts with RA, RARS and RCMD with hypo and hypo/hypercellular bone marrow and reactive lymphoid nodules in bone marrow. It can be initiated as 1 st or 2 nd line therapy and should be continued at least for 3 months before evaluating of response.",
