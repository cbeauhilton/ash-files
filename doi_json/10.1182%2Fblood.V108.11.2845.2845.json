    "abstract_text": "Background: Flavopiridol induces p53-independent apoptosis in CLL cells in vitro . Clinical studies using 24\u201372-hr continuous IV infusion (CIVI) schedules showed little activity, due to increased drug binding to human plasma proteins and inadequate free drug concentrations in vivo . Pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling indicated that giving flavopiridol by IV bolus (IVB) followed by 4-hr CIVI would achieve the necessary concentration to induce apoptosis of CLL cells. Methods: We conducted a phase I study in relapsed CLL using this PK-derived dosing schedule. Patients (pts) received flavopiridol by 30-min IVB followed by 4-hr CIVI weekly for 4 doses, every 6 weeks for up to 6 cycles. Results: Fifty-eight pts (43 male) with relapsed CLL (n=48) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (n=10) were enrolled. Median age was 60 years (range, 38\u201384). Median number of prior therapies was 4 (range, 1\u201314); 57 pts had failed fludarabine, with 48 pts refractory to or intolerant of fludarabine. Pts had bulky Rai stage I/II (n=13) or III/IV (n=45) disease. In the initial 2 cohorts, pts received 30 mg/m 2 IVB + 30 mg/m 2 CIVI (cohort 1, n=20) or 40 mg/m 2 IVB + 40 mg/m 2 CIVI (cohort 2, n=3). DLT was acute tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) in 2 pts in cohort 2. The 0.5 and 4.5 hr C max were 2.08 \u03bcM and 0.96 \u03bcM. PK modeling indicated that increasing the 4-hr CIVI dose would attain the target 4.5 hr C max of 1.5 \u03bcM. Thus, 14 of 19 pts in cohort 3 underwent dose escalation to 30 mg/m 2 IVB + 50 mg/m 2 CIVI beginning with cycle 2. Five pts were not dose escalated due to severe TLS with dose 1. Increased anti-tumor activity was observed with dose escalation. Median LDH was 344 U/L (range, 147\u20135591) with dose 1, and 858 U/L (range, 215\u20132658) with dose 1 of cycle 2. Eleven of 19 pts (58%) in cohort 3 achieved PR, including 10 of 14 pts (71%) undergoing dose escalation. The 0.5 and 4.5 hr C max were 1.95 \u03bcM and 1.54 \u03bcM at the escalated dose. Five of 8 pts with WBC \u2265 200 x 10 9 /L in cohorts 1\u20133 required hemodialysis for severe TLS with dose 1, compared to 1 of 34 pts with WBC < 200 x 10 9 /L. To determine if dose escalation could be safely performed earlier in pts at lesser risk of TLS, cohort 4 enrolled 16 pts with WBC < 200 x 10 9 /L, with dose escalation at dose 2 of cycle 1. One 1 pt required dialysis, and 14 pts were dose escalated. Preliminary results of cohort 4 indicate modestly greater clinical activity at the escalated dose; median LDH was 280 U/L (range, 119\u20131616) with dose 1, and 377 U/L (range, 140\u20132547) with dose 2. Six of 16 pts in cohort 4 achieved PR, and 2 additional pts experienced > 50% reduction of disease without improvement in counts. PK data from cohort 4 is being analyzed. In total, 28 pts were dose escalated beginning at cycle 2 (n=14) or dose 2 of cycle 1 (n=14); 4 pts required transient dialysis with dose escalation but were able to receive additional doses of flavopiridol, and 15 pts attained PR (54%). Conclusions: Flavopiridol can be safely dose escalated to 30 mg/m 2 IVB + 50 mg/m 2 CIVI in pts with WBC < 200 x 10 9 /L if there is not severe TLS with dose 1. Increasing the 4-hr CIVI dose achieves the target 4.5 hr C max and translates into higher clinical activity. Multi-center phase II studies to further investigate the safety and clinical activity of this dose escalation schedule are underway.",
