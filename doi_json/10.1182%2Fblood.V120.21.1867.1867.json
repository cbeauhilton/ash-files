    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1867 Secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia (2\u00b0 MDS/AML) are well-known complications that can occur after alkylating agent therapy for multiple myeloma (MM) or other cancers. However, until recently, the survival of MM pts was relatively short, a feature which may have contributed to a relatively low reported incidence of this complication in MM. The introduction of novel agents has improved survival rates of MM pts; lenalidomide (len) + dexamethasone\u2013currently approved for MM after one prior therapy\u2013 is one of the main regimens that has contributed to this finding. Since alkylating agents, either given orally or as part of high-dose melphalan + ASCT, still remain an important component of MM therapy, more pts may survive to be at risk for 2\u00b0 MDS/AML. Using the MM database at PMH, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients with relapsed/refractory (rel/ref) MM treated with len-based regimens (>1 cycle) to determine the incidence and characteristics of 2\u00b0 MDS/AML that developed during this therapy. Between 06/2006 and 08/2012 we identified 230 patients having received len-based therapy: len + corticosteroids 222 patients, len alone 8 patients, cyclophosphamide + len + prednisone (CPR) 32 patients. 2\u00b0 MDS/AML developed in 9 patients (3.9%) at a median of 89.6 months (range 30\u2013188) from the time of diagnosis of MM and 22.4 (2\u201356.6) months from the time of initiation of len regimens. The median follow-up from start of len was 1.6 years, and from the start of diagnosis 7.5 years. The median duration of len treatment was 9.4 months. The MDS/AML cytogenetic changes were variable, but four patients had deletions of all or part of chromosome 5. None of the 2\u00b0 MDS/AML had translocation t(4;14), as compared to 5.9% in (\u2212) MDS/AML subgroup. The characteristics of patients at the time of starting len, in those who later developed (+) or did not develop (\u2212) 2\u00b0 MDS/AML during therapy, are shown in Table 1 . Cumulative incidence of 2\u00b0 AML/MDS from time of diagnosis to time of 2\u00b0 AML/MDS is 4.5% [95% CI 2.2\u20139.2%] at 15 years. Cumulative incidence of 2\u00b0 AML/MDS from starting time of len to time of AML/MDS is 5% [95% CI 2.4\u201310.4%] at 5 years. The incidence of 2\u00b0 MDS/AML among those who had prior oral alkylators (OA) and/or concomitant OA was 10.5% (2/19 patients), concomitant cyclophosphamide only 7.6% (1/13), prior OA only 1.9% (3/152), and 6.5% for those who did not receive prior/concomitant OA (3/46). Grade 3\u20134 neutropenia occurred during len in 44% versus 58% in those with and without 2\u00b0 MDS/AML, respectively. G-CSF was used in 56% of pts who developed MDS compared with 53% who did not. We conclude: 1) The cumulative incidence of MDS/AML from starting len to time of 2\u00b0 AML/MDS was 5% at 5 years; 2) patients who developed 2\u00b0 MDS/AML while on len regimens were slightly older, had slight male predominance, higher beta-2-microglobulin, creatinine and platelet count, less often received prior ASCT, thalidomide, and bortezomib, but had longer exposure to len; 3) the relationship with OA is not entirely certain, but it appears that those with prior and concomitant exposure to OA have the highest incidence of this complication, which is most often seen in prolonged len treatment.
