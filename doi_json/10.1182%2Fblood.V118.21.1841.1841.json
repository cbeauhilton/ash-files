    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1841 Introduction: The dimeric Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) transcription factor plays a key role during multiple myeloma (MM) cell adhesion-induced cytokine secretion in bone marrow stromal cells, which in turn triggers MM cell growth in a paracrine manner. NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is mediated via canonical (IKK-\u03b1/IKK-\u03b2/NEMO-P50/65 or NF-\u03baB1) and non-canonical (IKK-\u03b1/IKK-\u03b1/NIK-p52/RelB or NF-\u03baB2) components. Prior studies have also linked constitutive activation of non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway to genetic abnormalities/mutation, allowing for an autocrine growth of MM cells. Other recent studies showed that constitutive NF-\u03baB activity in tumor cells from MM patients renders these cells refractory to inhibition by bortezomib; and in fact, that bortezomib induces canonical NF-\u03baB activity. These reports provided the impetus for the development of an agent with ability to modulate canonical and/or non-canonical NF-\u03baB axis, allowing for a more robust and specific inhibition of NF-\u03baB. Recent research and development efforts at Nereus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., have identified a novel small molecule acanthoic acid analog NPI-1342 as a potent NF-\u03baB inhibitor. Here, we examined the effects of NPI-1342 on canonical versus non-canonical NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, as well as its anti-tumor activity against MM cells using both in vitro and in vivo model systems. Methods: We utilized MM.1S, MM.1R, RPMI-8226, U266, KMS12PE, NCI-H929, OCI-MY5, LR5, Dox-40, OPM1, and OPM2 human MM cell lines, as well as purified tumor cells from patients with MM. Cell viability assays were performed using MTT and Trypan blue exclusion assays. Signal transduction pathways were evaluated using immunoblot analysis, ELISA, and enzymology assays. Animal model studies were performed using the SCID-hu model, which recapitulates the human BM milieu in vivo . Results: We first examined the effects of NPI-1342 on lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced NF-\u03baB activity. Results showed that NPI-1342 inhibits LPS-stimulated NF-\u03baB activity in vitro , as measured by phosphorylation of IkBa. To determine whether NPI-1342 triggers a differential inhibitory effect on IKK\u03b2 versus IKK\u03b1, MM.1S MM cells were treated with NPI-1342 for 48 hours, and protein lysates were subjected to kinase activity assays. NPI-1342 blocked IKK\u03b1, but not IKK\u03b2 or IKK\u03b3 phosphorylation. We next assessed whether the inhibitory effect of NPI-1342 on NF-\u03baB activity is associated with cytotoxicity in MM cells. We utilized a panel of MM cell lines: at least five of these have mutations of TRAF3 (MM.1S, MM.1R, DOX40 and U266); one has no known NF-\u03baB mutations (OPM2), and one has amplification of NF-\u03baB1 (OCI-MY5). Treatment of MM cell lines and primary patient (CD138 positive) MM cells for 48 hours significantly decreased their viability (IC 50 range 15\u201320 \u03bcM) (P < 0.001; n=3) without affecting the viability of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting selective anti-MM activity and a favorable therapeutic index for NPI-1342. NPI-1342-induced a marked increase in Annexin V+ and PI- apoptotic cell population (P < 0.001, n=3). Mechanistic studies showed that NPI-1342-triggered apoptosis in MM cells is associated with activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP cleavage. We next examined the in vivo effects of NPI-1342 in human MM xenograft models. For these studies, we utilized the SCID-hu MM model, which recapitulates the human BM milieu in vivo . In this model, MM cells are injected directly into human bone chips implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice, and MM cell growth is assessed by serial measurements of circulating levels of soluble human IL-6R in mouse serum. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with NPI-1342 (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally, QD1-5 for 2 weeks), but not vehicle alone, significantly inhibits MM tumor growth in these mice (10 mice each group; P = 0.004). The doses of NPI-1342 were well tolerated by the mice, without significant weight loss. Finally, immunostaining of implanted human bone showed robust apoptosis and blockade of NF-\u03baB in mice treated with NPI-1342 versus vehicle alone. Conclusions: We demonstrate the efficacy of a novel small molecule inhibitor of NF-\u03baB NPI-1342 in MM using both in vitro and in vivo models. NPI-1342 blocks NF-\u03baB activity with a preferential inhibitory activity against IKK-\u03b1 component of NF-\u03baB signaling. Our preclinical studies support evaluation of NPI-1342 as a potential MM therapy. Disclosures: Hideshima: Acetylon: Consultancy.
