    "abstract_text": "Dysregulation of transcriptional control is a common phenomenon associated with oncogenesis. Inhibitors of DNA binding (ID) proteins are critical actors in lymphopoiesis, acting as regulators of transcription through a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain which enables heterodimerization with basic HLH (bHLH) proteins inhibiting their binding to DNA. ID proteins have been implicated in malignant transformation, but their role in multiple myeloma (MM) is unknown. Here, we evaluated the role of ID proteins in biology and transcriptional dysregulation in MM. We first evaluated the expression of the four ID proteins in normal and malignant plasma cells using RNA sequencing data from a cohort of 360 newly diagnosed MM patients and 16 normal plasma cells. We observed significant downregulation of ID2 in primary patient MM cells in comparison to normal plasma cells (p 0.0013). To study ID2 function in MM cells, we next overexpressed ID2 in 2 MM cell lines (MM1S and NCIH929) and observed a significant decrease in proliferation rate, together with G 0 /G 1 phase cell cycle arrest. We performed RNA-sequencing to evaluate the transcriptomic changes following ID2 overexpression. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed significant downregulation of genes involved in E2F pathway and significant changes in pathways related to immune response, regulation of cell death and cell proliferation. In addition, analysis of upstream cis-regulatory motifs of genes significantly dysregulated in both cell lines (>1.5 fold change) showed a highly significant enrichment for bHLH class I transcription factors (E proteins) binding motifs. Conversely, stable ID2 knockdown in 4 MM cell lines (MM1S, NCIH929, RPMI8226 and KMS11) expressing intermediate levels of ID2, showed an increased proliferation rate, assessed by cell counting, H 3 -thymidine incorporation and ATP production. RNA-sequencing after ID2 knockdown in MM1S and NCIH929 cells showed 600 common genes upregulated in both cell lines (>1.5 fold change). GSEA revealed upregulation of pathways involved in inflammatory response and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, while upstream cis regulatory motifs analysis showed a highly significant enrichment for binding motifs of bHLH class I transcription factors E proteins, in particular Tcf3 (p <0.0001). Next, we sought to investigate the mechanisms involved in ID2 downregulation in MM. Since the role of the microenvironment is critical in myelomagenesis, we evaluated the impact of BM microenvironment on ID2 expression in a co-culture system. Using bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) derived from MM patients and stromal cell line (HS5) in co-culture with various MM cell lines, we observed that both cell-cell interactions and soluble factors secreted by BMSC or HS5 were able to significantly downregulate ID2 expression at the RNA and protein level. Furthermore, ID2 overexpression in MM cell lines (MM1S and NCIH929) abrogated the impact of BMSC on MM cell proliferation. Next, we evaluated ID2 promoter methylation profile and binding motifs using Sequenom mass array and the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), respectively. While we didn't observe any increase in methylation of CpG islands located in ID2 promoter in co-culture, explaining ID2 downregulation, we identified several binding motifs corresponding to known driver transcription factors in MM. Especially, we identified SP1 binding motif and we confirmed SP1 binding to ID2 promoter by ChIP-sequencing in MM1S, NCIH929 and U266. These data demonstrate that in MM, ID2 acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting major transcriptomic changes and cell cycle arrest. Bone marrow stromal cells further induce significant downregulation of ID2 in myeloma cells suggesting that ID2/bHLH axis and other ID2 related pathways represent a potential new therapeutic target in myeloma.
