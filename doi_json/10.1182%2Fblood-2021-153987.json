    "abstract_text": "Background: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive sub-type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma(Liu, et al. Am J Hematol 2019). All three approved CD19-directed CAR-T therapies (axicabtagene ciloleucel, tisagenlecleucel, lisocabtagene maraleucel) are associated with toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) that can be severe, resulting in non-relapse mortality, ICU admission, and significant non-drug related health resource utilization which represent barriers to access and adoption (Nabhan, et al. J Clin. Pathway 2017). Studies have shown that early elevation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) levels 1-day post CAR-T infusion correlates with severe ICANS (Rossi, et al. EMA Workshop 2016), which is a negative prognostic factor for overall survival (Karschnia, et al. Blood 2019). It has been proposed that upon contact with the tumor, CAR-Ts produce GM-CSF, which serves as a communication conduit between the specific immune response of CAR-T and the off-target inflammatory cascade produced by myeloid lineage cells, causing myeloid cells to expand and promote the production of other downstream proinflammatory chemokines (MCP-1, IL-8, IP-10), cytokines (IL-1, IL-6), and other markers of systemic inflammation (CRP, Ferritin) (Sterner, et al. Blood 2019). Moreover, IL-6 is predominately released by tumor cells in a contact-independent manner (Barrett et al. Blood 2016), which helps explain why the prophylactic administration of tocilizumab is not effective in reducing the overall incidence of CRS or ICANS, as this cytokine is downstream in the inflammatory cascade. Further, the prophylactic use of tocilizumab has been shown to increase the incidence of all-grades and grade >3 ICANS (Locke, et al. Blood 2017). Lenzilumab is a novel Humaneered \u00ae monoclonal antibody that neutralizes GM-CSF and has demonstrated potential to reduce the hyper-immune mediated cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and significantly improve the likelihood of survival without ventilation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, as reported in the LIVE-AIR phase 3 study (Temesgen, et al. medRxiv 2021). Methods: Eligible patients are adults (\u2265 18 y) with relapsed or refractory DLBCL or are chemorefractory. Prior therapy must have included an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and an anthracycline-containing regimen. Patients will undergo leukapheresis and may receive optional corticosteroid bridging therapy. Patients will then receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy on Days \u20123 to \u20125 followed by infusion of lenzilumab on Day 0, 6-hrs prior to CAR-T infusion. Approximately 40 accredited sites across the U.S. certified to administer the three commercially available CAR-Ts have been engaged to participate in this 2-part study. In Part 1, all patients will receive lenzilumab 1800mg via a single 2-hour infusion prior to CAR-T administration. The objective of Part 1 is to evaluate the optimal regimen and assess whether a second dose of lenzilumab post-CAR-T infusion is required. A translational assessment of GM-CSF axis suppression, levels of CAR-T cells in blood, other inflammatory markers and lenzilumab PK/PD will be evaluated, along with the incidence and severity of CRS and ICANS, objective response rates (ORR) and rates of complete response (CR) by Day 28 to select the optimal regimen to carry forward into Part 2. The objective of Part 2 is to confirm whether lenzilumab can improve the toxicity and tolerance of CAR-T while maintaining or improving efficacy and durability of response. Up to 250 patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive lenzilumab or placebo with CAR-T per standard of care. The primary endpoint of the study is incidence of grade >2 CRS and/or ICANS by Day 28, with a key secondary endpoint of CR at 6-months in patients without grade \u2265 2 CRS and/or ICANS at Day 28 (Toxicity-free CR). This design and sample size yields 90% power to detect a 50% reduction in the primary outcome measure. Secondary endpoints include incidence of all grades and grade >3 CRS and/or ICANS, respectively; ORR and CR at 1, 3, 6, 12 months; durability of CR; progression-free survival, overall survival and health related quality of life using validated patient reported outcome measures. In addition, the study will explore the CRS and ICANS grading criteria that have been utilized with each of the approved CAR-Ts.
