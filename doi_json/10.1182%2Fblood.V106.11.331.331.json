    "abstract_text": "Background: Pre-treatment cytogenetics is a known predictor of outcome in haematological malignancies. However, its value in adult ALL is generally limited to the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation; mostly due to the low incidence of other recurrent chromosomal abnormalities. Methods: Since 1993, cytogenetic data from patients enrolled on a joint MRC/ECOG trial have been collated and reviewed centrally in the UK and US. Karyotype data from patients registered before the Imatinib amendment were pooled using standard cytogenetic definitions and classification criteria. Results: A successful cytogenetic result was achieved in 938/1235 (76%) cases; while 297 (24%) failed with <20 normal metaphases analyzed. Patients were classified into the following mutually exclusive groups: t(9;22)(q34;q11) n=193(21%); t(4;11)(q21;q23) n=50(5%); other MLL translocations n=11(1%), t(8;14)(q24;q32) and variants n=14(1%); t(1;19)(q23;p13) n=23(2%); T cell receptor translocations n=35(4%); low hypodiploidy (30\u201339 chromosomes) /near triploidy n=23(2%); high hyperdiploidy n=83(9%); tetraploidy n=12(1%); complex karyotype (>=5 aberrations) n=48(5%); other abnormal n=255(27%); normal n=191(20%). MRC and ECOG patients showed similar cytogenetic distributions, except for t(9;22), which was significantly more prevalent in the ECOG cohort (27% v 18%, p<0.001). However, the incidence of t(9;22) increased with age and ECOG patients were significantly older. Overall, the 5 year event free survival (EFS) was 32% (95% CI 30%\u201335%) with a median follow-up time of 5.1 years and did not differ between the two cohorts. The EFS of t(9;22) patients [15% (11%\u201321%)] was significantly inferior compared with all other cases [36% (32%\u201339%)] (p<0.001) and was independent of age and white cell count (WCC). Univariate logrank analyses identified t(4;11) and high hyperdiploidy as indicators of poor and good prognosis, respectively, compared with other Ph negative cases, but neither was independent of age and WCC. Three subgroups were shown to have a significantly worse EFS compared to other Ph negative cases by logrank analyses after adjusting for age and WCC: t(8;14) 14% (2%\u201337%) v 36% (32%\u201340%) (p=0.01); low hypodiploidy 22% (8%\u201340%) v 36% (32%\u201340%) (p=0.02); complex karyotype 21% (10%\u201333%) v 32% (29%\u201335%) (p=0.005). Neither of the latter two subgroups were associated with other poor risk features such as age, WCC or failure to achieve a remission within 4 weeks. Conclusions: This is the largest cytogenetic dataset of adult ALL reported to date and demonstrates the importance of combining cohorts to increase the number of cases available for analysis. The observation that low hypodiploidy and, for the first time, karyotype complexity confer a poor risk, demonstrates that cytogenetic subgroups other than the Ph translocation can and should be used to risk stratify adults with ALL to alternative treatments."
