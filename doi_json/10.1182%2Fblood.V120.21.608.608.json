    "abstract_text": "Abstract 608 Forward-genetic screens have become a powerful method to study the pathogenesis of human disease and gene function. Chemical mutagenesis in mice using the mutagen, N-ethyl N-nitrosourea (ENU), has shown to be highly successful in elucidating novel genes or alleles in a variety of biological pathways, describing new functions of existing genes, and establishing mouse models that accurately recapitulate human disease. Advances in mapping strategies and deep sequencing technologies has dramatically simplified mutation detection, making ENU mutagenesis screens a feasible tool to study specific organ systems. To identify novel alleles regulating erythropoiesis, our laboratory has undertaken a dominant ENU mutagenesis screen. In this screen, the G1 progeny were screened at seven weeks of age for abnormalities in red cell indices (MCV, MCH, and HCT) using an automated hematological analyser. Here, we describe the identification of mice with a missense mutation of the large GTPase Dynamin 2 (DNM2) leading to an amino acid substitution V235G, predicted to lie within the nucleotide binding pocket for GTP. Western blot analysis for DNM2 protein revealed 50% protein levels in heterozygotes, suggesting that the point mutation leads to loss of protein rather than a dominant negative effect. Inherited DNM2 mutations are associated with autosomal dominant Charcot Tooth Myopathy (CTM) and Centronuclear Myopathy (CNM), but no recognised blood disorders. Heterozygous DNM2 V235G displayed hypochromic, microcytic anemia \u2013 HGB (15 g/dl compared to 16.5 g/dl in wild type mice), MCV (41.3 fl compared to 45.6 fl in wild type mice) and MCH (12.7 pg compared to 14.5 pg in wild type mice), but no obvious neuropathy or myopathy. Homozygosity was lethal before embryonic (E) day 8.5. DNM2 is an essential component in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is required for uptake of transferrin into red cells for incorporation of heme. Accordingly, endocytosis assays for transferrin uptake by FACS and confocal microscopy revealed reduced uptake in heterozygotes, explaining the microcytic hypochromic anemia. Western blot analysis for ferritin demonstrated reduced cellular ferritin, indicating cellular iron deficiency. Thus, this mouse model provides the first in vivo evidence that haplo-insufficiency of DNM2 can lead to iron deficiency anemia. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
