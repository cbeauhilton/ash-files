    "abstract_text": "From a high throughput RNAi screen of the human druggable genome targeting the KMS11 cell line, we identified the suppression of the vacuolar H + - ATPase (V-ATPase) family as cytotoxic to myeloma cells. In the screen, two oligos against each gene for the V-ATPase subunits ATP6V1A and ATP6V1B1 resulted in suppression of cell growth (50% and 60% inhibition of cell viability respectively). We further confirmed this result using both lentiviral shRNA knockdown and two small molecule inhibitors specific for V-ATPase. Silencing of ATP6V1A by lentiviral shRNA knock-down in KMS11 and in OPM1 myeloma cell lines caused 75\u201380% reduction of cell viability at 5 days post infection (measured by MTT assay). Consistent with this result, the V-ATPase specific inhibitors, bafilomycin A1 and REATA 203, both inhibited the growth of a genetically heterogeneous and standardized panel of 14 human myeloma cell lines in vitro with an IC 50 ranging from 2.2 \u2013 8.9 nM (mean 5.25 nM) for bafilomycin A1 and 46\u20131594 nM (mean 542.5 nM)) for REATA 203. We further demonstrated that patient samples (n=10) were sensitive to 20nM bafilomycin A1 which induced a mean of 58% of MM cells to undergo apoptosis (range 10% to 93%) after 24 hours of treatment. Similar to bafilomycin A1, treatment of primary patient-derived MM cells with 500 nM REATA 203 for 72 hours resulted in a mean 69% apoptosis (range 24% to 97%). In contrast, non-myeloma cells (the CD138- fractions of the bone marrow samples) were less sensitive - mean 9% apoptosis (range from 0% to 34%) under the same treatment conditions. Of high interest, however, unlike most drugs we have studied in pre-clinical myeloma models, the cytotoxicity induced by bafilomycin A1 in MM cell lines is abrogated by co-culture with patient bone marrow stromal cells but is not affected by IL-6 or IGF-1 treatment. Dexamethasone- or melphalan-resistant MM cell lines were also highly sensitive to both bafilomycin A1 and REATA 203. In a xenographic JJN3 mouse model, bafilomycin A1 suppresses and delays growth of tumor in a dose-dependent fashion. Gene expression analysis of normal-donor bone marrow plasma cells ( n =19), primary tumor samples from MM patients ( n =107) and normal somatic tissues demonstrates ubiquitous expression of most subunits of V-ATPase, however, some subunits are preferentially expressed in myeloma cells compared with normal plasma cells, including ATP6V1F (84% vs. 11%), ATP6V1E1 (29% vs. 5%), ATP6V1G2 (17% vs. 0%) and ATP6V0E 2 (36% vs. 16%). In conclusion, our data indicate that vacuolar H + -ATPase inhibitors are of interest as potential therapeutics for MM."
