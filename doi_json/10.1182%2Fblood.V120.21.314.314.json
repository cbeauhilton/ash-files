    "abstract_text": "Abstract 314 Defects in the apoptosis program are a hallmark of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), characterized by high expression levels of bcl2 and Mcl1. Notably, this de-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins is not sufficient to maintain long-term survival of CLL cells, which remain highly dependent on pro-survival factors provided by the leukemia-microenvironment. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) play an important role for microenvironment mediated survival of CLL cells, based on the provision of soluble and membrane-bound factors. The stroma-CLL interactions not only protect CLL cells from spontaneous, but also from drug-induced apoptosis, clinically recognized as minimal-residual disease. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of CLL-stroma interactions may offer new therapeutic options and help in eradicating CLL cells from the bone-marrow niche. Here we describe that monoclonal B-cells from CLL patients impose morphological and genetic changes in stromal cells, which become reminiscent of cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). Comparative gene expression profiles indicate that contact with primary CLL cells induce the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in stromal cells. Further characterization of the underlying signaling pathways activated in stromal cells revealed that CLL cells induce the expression of protein-kinase C-\u03b2 in BMSCs. Blocking the up-regulation of PKC-\u03b2 by siRNA abrogated the pro-survival effects of stromal cells on CLL cells. Furthermore, following induction of PKC-\u03b2, BMSCs activate NF-kappaB through a Bcl10-independent, but NEMO/IKKgamma-dependent pathway. Gene expression profiling of NEMO-proficient and deficient BMSCs indicated that NF-kappaB regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules by stromal cells, required to promote survival of CLL. Interference with the NF-kappaB activation in BMSCs abrogated the pro-survival effects of stromal cells on CLL, similar to PKC-\u03b2 deficient stromal cells. To demonstrate that this pathway is also important in vivo, Tcl1-CLL was transplanted into syngeneic PKC-\u03b2 knock-out and wild-type mice. Notably, all PKC-\u03b2 wild-type mice died of a CLL-like disease, whereas PKC-\u03b2 kock-out animals were entirely resistant to CLL transplants. Immunofluorescence staining of PKC-\u03b2 in bone marrow trephine biopsies indicated that this pathway is also activated in mesenchymal stromal cells of CLL patients. Importantly, our data provide further evidence that the PKC-\u03b2 \u2013 NF-kappaB pathway is also activated in stomal cells by monoclonal B-cells from ALL and mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) patients. Conclusively, we describe a novel survival signaling pathway activated by monoclonal B-cells in BMSCs. Interference with the PKC-\u03b2-NF-kappaB pathway activated in the leukemia/lymphoma microenvironment may offer new therapeutic options to fully eradicate malignant B-cells from bone-marrow niches.
