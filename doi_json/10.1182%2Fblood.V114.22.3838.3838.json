    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3838 Poster Board III-774 Hypoxia is known to be linked to increased metastatic potential and a treatment-resistant phenotype leading to rapid progression and poor prognosis in solid tumors. We confirmed previous data[1] on hypoxia in human multiple myeloma (MM) in the 5T33MM syngeneic murine model of MM by using H&E staining and Hypoxyprobe (Pimonidazole) staining on consecutive serial sections from both naive mice and 5T33MMvv diseased mice. We observed a physiological hypoxic situation in MM diseased bone marrow. Given the contribution of hypoxia to tumor progression and drug resistance, a number of hypoxia-targeted therapeutics are under development. TH-302 is a new hypoxia-activated prodrug (HAP) that is currently being evaluated in the clinical trials as monotherapy and in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of solid tumors. The aims of the current study are (1) to demonstrate the effects of TH302 on MM cells in hypoxic conditions, focusing on apoptosis and cell cycle and associated signaling pathways and (2) to evaluate potential therapeutic effects when used in an experimental mouse MM model. We evaluated the effects of TH-302 in vitro on the murine 5T33MMvt cell line and the human LP-1, MMS-1, RPMI-8226, Karpas MM cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that TH-302 (0.5-50\u03bcM) can induce significant Go/G1 cell cycle phase arrest and apoptosis in hypoxic conditions (both 1% and 0% O2) in a concentration dependent manner, in contrast to normoxic conditions (20% O2) (p0.05). In conclusion, these results show that hypoxia-activated treatment with TH-302 activates apoptosis and induces cell cycle arrest in MM cells, under hypoxic conditions, both in vitro and in vivo and therefore represents a promising therapeutic approach for multiple myeloma.
