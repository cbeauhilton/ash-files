    "abstract_text": "Purpose: The International Prognostic Index (IPI) and Follicular Lymphoma Prognostic Index (FLIPI) are used as prognostic indices for NHL and indolent lymphoma. However, marginal zone B-cell Lymphoma (MZL) evidences a distinctive clinical presentation and a natural course; thus, in this study, we attempted to devise an adequate prognostic index for MZL. Patients and method: From 1990 to 2005, 205 patients diagnosed with MZL were retrospectively reviewed. After analysis of the prognostic factors, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), we constructed a prognostic index of MZL (MZLPI) via the summation of each factor. We then compared PFS and OS with IPI, FLIPI, and MZLPI. Results: According to our multivariate analysis of PFS and OS of MZL, nodal MZL, ECOG performance \u2265 2 and advanced stage were composed of MZLPI. MZLPI was grouped as follows: score 0 as a low risk group, score 1 as an intermediate risk group, and score \u22652 as a high risk group. The PFS curve, according to MZLPI results, evidenced a more discriminated pattern than IPI and FLIPI, and this was especially true in the intermediate risk group. In OS, MZLPI ( P =0.0007) evidenced a more discriminated pattern than IPI ( P =NS) or FLIPI ( P =0.0044). Conclusion: MZLPI, which is constructed of relatively simple factors, may represent a useful prognostic index for the prediction of PFS and OS in MZL, and may also be used as a substitute for IPI or FLIPI."
