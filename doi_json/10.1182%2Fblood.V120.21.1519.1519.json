    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1519 Background: The outcome of patients (pts) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and FLT3 -ITD mutation is poor, particularly in the relapse setting. Sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of FLT 3 kinase with reported clinical activity as a single agent (Metzelder S, Blood, 2009), and in combination with chemotherapy (Ravandi F, JCO, 2010). A potential mechanism of resistance to FLT3 kinase inhibitors is high levels of FLT3 ligand (FL) as seen after myelosuppressive chemotherapy. We hypothesized that combining sorafenib with a less myelosuppressive agent, such as 5-azacytidine (AZA), may lead to higher and more durable responses than cytotoxic chemotherapy. Furthermore, both drugs have demonstrated a potential for inducing differentiation in AML cells, thereby providing further rationale for the combination. Methods: Pts were eligible if they had relapsed or refractory AML, were 18 years of age or older, and had adequate performance status (ECOG \u2264 2) and organ function. Older pts without prior therapy were also eligible, if they were deemed unsuitable to receive chemotherapy. Presence of FLT3 -ITD was not a requirement but these pts were targeted for enrollment. Treatment regimen included AZA 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days together with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily for 28 days; cycles were repeated in approximately 4 to 5-week intervals. Overall responses were assessed after the completion of at least one cycle of therapy and at the time of the best peripheral blood and bone marrow response. Plasma samples were collected on approximately Day 1 and Day 10 of each cycle. To assess the degree of FLT3 inhibition, the plasma inhibitory activity (PIA) assay was performed using the Molm-14 cell line (Levis M, Blood, 2006). Plasma FL concentrations were measured using an ELISA kit (R&D Systems). Results: 43 pts with AML with a median age of 64 years (range, 24\u201387) were enrolled. They included 19 (44%) pts with diploid cytogenetics, 11 (26%) with chromosome 5/7 or complex cytogenetic abnormalities, and 13 (30%) with miscellaneous abnormalities. Prior to the initiation of treatment, FLT3 -ITD was detected in 40/43 (93%) pts with a median allelic ratio of 0.28 (range, 0 \u2013 0.93). They had received a median of 2 prior treatments (range, 0\u20137). 16 (37%) pts had received \u22653 prior regimens and 9 had failed therapy with FLT3 kinase inhibitors (5 with AC220, 1 with PKC412, and 6 with sorafenib, either as monotherapy or with chemotherapy or plerixafor); 3 had failed 2 prior FLT3 inhibitors. 6 pts were inevaluable as they discontinued therapy before response assessment at one month and 3 are too early for response assessment. The overall CR/CRi/PR rate among the 34 evaluable pts is 44%, including 10 (29%) with CRi and 4 (12%) with CR and 1 (3%) with PR (in this pt, bone marrow blast declined from 51% to 6% with normalization of blood counts). Overall, pts have received a median of 3 (range, 1\u20139) treatment cycles with the median number of cycles to response among the responders being 2 (range, 1 \u2013 4) and the median time to achieving response, 2.1 months (range, 0.9 \u2013 4.6 months). The median duration of CR/CRi Is 2.3 months (range, 1 \u2013 12.2 + months). Six pts have proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplant. The most common study drug-related adverse events were rash and fatigue with no deaths attributable to study medications. One pt developed grade 3 cardiomyopathy suspected to be related to the study regimen. Of the 34 pts included in the clinical analysis, there were 22 pts from whom plasma samples spanning at least one cycle of therapy were available. Among them, 64% achieved FLT3 inhibition to a targeted level of less than 15% of baseline during their first cycle of therapy. Median survival in pts who achieved this degree of inhibition was 238 days, while median survival in pts who did not reach this level was 154 days (p=0.13). Mean FL levels at cycle 1, day 1 and cycle 1, day 10 were 9 pg/mL and 17 pg/mL, respectively. Mean FL levels at cycle 2, day 0 and cycle 2, day 10 were 27 pg/mL and 54 pg/mL, respectively. Conclusions: Combination of AZA and Sorafenib is effective for the treatment of older pts and pts with relapsed and refractory AML and FLT3 -ITD mutation. While not statistically significant, there was a trend toward improved survival in pts with adequate FLT3 inhibition during cycle 1. FL levels did not rise to the levels seen in pts receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. Disclosures: Ravandi: Bayer/Onyx: Honoraria, Research Funding; Celgene: Honoraria, Research Funding.
