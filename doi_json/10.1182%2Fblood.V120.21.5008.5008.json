    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5008 A 48 year old man was referred to the Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland in April 2008 with anemia (Hemoglobin; 10. 4 g/dl) and mild renal impairment (eGFR; 75. 4 mL/min/1. 73m 2 ). An initial diagnostic monoclonal protein screen (serum protein electrophoresis (SPE), serum immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) and serum free light chain (FLC) analysis) revealed an IgA\u03bb monoclonal protein (0. 8g/dL) with monoclonal serum FLC and an abnormal serum FLC \u03ba/\u03bb ratio (0. 0001; RI, 0. 26\u20131. 65). A bone marrow biopsy at that time confirmed 60% involvement of monoclonal \u03bb - restricted plasma cells; a bone survey did not detect any osteolysis. The patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM) (ISS stage I, Durie and Salmon stage IA) and was initially treated with 6 cycles of vincristin, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (VAD). The patient responded well to the induction treatment and subsequently underwent a successful autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The patient was monitored for 3 years subsequent to the ASCT with both serum and urine electrophoresis, serum FLC analysis (Freelite) and heavy chain/light chain (HLC) immunoassays (Hevylite). Sixteen months following the ASCT the dFLC (involved \u03bb FLC\u2013 uninvolved \u03ba FLC) concentration began to increase, the FLC \u03ba/\u03bb ratio became abnormal with a trace of \u03bb Bence Jones protein (BJP) detected by urine IFE. However, both SPE and IFE were normal and the HLC ratio (IgA\u03bb/IgA\u03ba) was within the normal range. During the next 9 months the dFLC continued to increase and a \u03bb BJP could now be clearly detected on the urine IFE. 27 months following the ASCT the patient sustained a pathological fracture of the tibiae and was referred to our centre 4 months later. At this point, the dFLC concentration was highly elevated (3168 mg/L) with a \u03bb BJP detectable by both serum and urine IFE. However, there was no detectable monoclonal intact immunoglobulin by serum IFE or HLC analysis, indicating disease relapse by a separate FLC clone; referred to as light chain escape (LCE). A bone marrow biopsy revealed 15% involvement of \u03bb restricted plasma cells; this time a bone survey identified osteolysis. The patient was diagnosed with progression of multiple myeloma and received 6 cycles of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (VCD regimen). He responded well to treatment and 3 years following the ASCT achieved a CR as indicated by a normalized \u03ba/\u03bb FLC ratio, negative immunofixation with 1\u20133% bone marrow plasma cells. The patient is now well and able to continue with normal life. In this case study the increase in the dFLC levels was the first indication of disease progression and highlights the importance of monitoring intact immunoglobulin MM patients with serum FLC immunoassays for early detection of LCE.
