    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Outcomes of pts with lower-risk MDS is heterogeneous as shown by validated prognostic scales such as the MD Anderson lower risk prognostic scoring system (MDA-LRPSS) (Garcia-Manero, et al, Leukemia, 2008). We have previously shown that use of lower doses of HMA in lower-risk MDS is safe and can be effective (Jabbour, et al, Blood, 2017). Determining long-term benefit of early intervention with HMA in pts with lower-risk MDS is necessary. METHODS: We report the long-term follow up of a phase 2 study of azacitidine (AZA) or decitabine (DAC) for pts with MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) with low or intermediate-1 IPSS risk score. A Bayesian response-adaptive design was used to assign pts to either DAC 20mg/m 2 intravenously (i.v.) for 3 days or AZA 75mg/m 2 i.v. or subcutaneous for 3 days. Courses were repeated every 4 weeks. Response was evaluated following IWG 2006 criteria. Next-generation sequencing was performed using targeted PCR-based sequencing. Sanger sequencing for SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 and ZRSR2 was performed on a subset of pts. Kaplan-Meier product limit method was used to estimate survival outcomes for each clinical/demographic factor. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify any association with each of the variables and survival outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 113 pts were treated: 73 with decitabine and 40 with azacitidine. Pt characteristics are shown in Figure 1A. Median age was 70 years (44-88). By the MDA-LRPSS 13 (11%) pts had low risk, 52 (46%) intermediate and 48 high (42%). Identified mutations are detailed in Figure 1B. The median number of cycles was 15 (3-74) and the median number of cycles to best response was 2.2 months (1-19.5 months). Response outcomes are shown in Figure 1C. Overall, DAC-treated pts were more likely to show response than AZA-treated (OS = 2.24, 95% C.I. 0.95-5.35, p = 0.047). Median follow-up is 59 months (95% CI 55.7-62.3). Median overall survival (OS) was 33.4 months with no significant difference based on treatment arm (DAC 38 months vs AZA 31 months, p=0.435). A total of 13 (12%) pts suffered transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Based on the MDA-LRPSS, pts with intermediate risk had worse survival than low-risk, but this was not statistically significant (HR 2.5, p=0.09). High-risk pts had significantly worse survival than low-risk (HR 3.5, p = 0.017) (Figure 1D). To determine if survival outcomes were improved compared to expected based on the MDA-LRPSS, we compared observed outcomes (continues lines in Figure 1E) to reported outcomes in the original MDA-LRPSS cohort (dashed lines in Figure 1E). Median OS compared favorably with expected outcomes in pts with intermediate and high-risk with no significant differences in patients with low risk category. The number of mutations did not correlate with outcomes but DNMT3A (HR 4.1, p=0.003) , TP53 (HR 3.6, p=0.002) and U2AF1 (HR 2.1, p=0.018) mutations correlated with poor OS. U2AF1 mutations correlated with shorter transformation free survival (TFS) (HR 6.3, p=0.002). TP53 mutations correlated with shorter event-free survival and response duration (HR 3.9, p=0.006). On multivariate analysis, age, U2AF1, TP53 , and DNMT3A mutations all correlate with poor OS. By univariate analysis there were no differences in OS, TFS, or duration of response by HMA. Mutations had similar effects on OS regardless of HMA used. Pts with SF3B1 mutations had a median OS which was not reached at the time of follow up (Figure 1F). Treatment was overall well-tolerated in both arms with most adverse events being grade 1 or 2. CONCLUSIONS: Low-doses of HMA in pts with lower-risk MDS are safe and can improve outcomes compared to historical data in pts with intermediate or high risk features by the MDA-LRPSS.
