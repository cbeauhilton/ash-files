    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) are a backbone of multiple myeloma (MM) therapy. The proteasome harbors six proteolytically active subunits (\u03b21, \u03b22 and \u03b25 of the constitutive (c) and the immunoproteasome (i), respectively). They differ in substrate preferences and affinity for PIs. \u03b25c was identified as the rate-limiting proteolytic proteasome activity, while \u03b22 and \u03b21 activity received little attention. Consecutively, all proteasome-inhibiting drug candidates (bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib, oprozomib, delanzomib, marizomib) by design target \u03b25c, but differ in co-inhibition of non-\u03b25 activities. Current chemical biology tools allow highly selective inhibition and visualization of individual proteasome subunits in living cells. We lack data that identify the most effective pattern of \u03b25 and non-\u03b25 type of proteasome inhibition in MM cells, as well as a head to head comparison of PIs and drug candidates, and their proteasome subunit inhibition profile in relation to pharmacodynamic activity. Such data shall allow rational selection and positioning of proteasome-inhibiting drugs. Methods: Head to head comparison of bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib, oprozomib, delanzomib and marizomib was performed in MM cells. Non-commercial, highly subunit-selective PIs and activity-based fluorescent chemical probes (ABP) were used to assess the most effective pattern of inhibition of proteasome subunits, in conjunction with a fluorescent ubiquitin Ub- G67V- GFP construct, and related to the viability of MM. Results: All commercial PI tested target primarily \u03b25 activity and in higher concentrations co-targeted \u03b22 and/or \u03b21 (Table 1). In equimolar comparison, most effective PI was marizomib, followed by bortezomib, delanzomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib and oprozomib. MM cell viability inversely correlated with functional proteasome inhibition. Surprisingly, during short term, 1h pulse exposure mimicking the pharmacokinetics of i.v. proteasome inhibiting drugs, \u03b25-selective proteasome inhibition was not sufficient to functionally inhibit protein degradation or induce cytotoxicity, even in PI-sensitive MM cells. Only co-inhibition \u03b25 with either \u03b21 or \u03b22 resulted in accumulation of polyubiquitinated protein and decreased MM cell viability. Long time (48h) continuous \u03b25-selective inhibition likewise induced cell death in PI-sensitive MM, however, only co-inhibition of \u03b25 and \u03b22 activity induced cytotoxicity in PI-resistant MM. Conclusion: All commercial PIs by design target \u03b25c activity and differ in their co-targeting of non-\u03b25 activities. Co-inhibition of \u03b21 and \u03b22 determines cytotoxicity. Selective inhibition of \u03b25 by pulse exposure is not sufficient, but co-inhibition of \u03b25 and \u03b22 is the most effective combination to induce cytotoxicity, in particularly in PI resistant cells. This inhibition pattern is provided only by marizomib and high dose carfilzomib. By contrast, low dose of carfilzomib does not deliver co-inhibition of \u03b22 and therefore has no advantage over bortezomib. Together, these results give a rational basis to select individual proteasome inhibitors for the treatment of MM: cytotoxicity in PI-sensitive MM is achieved by co-targeting of \u03b25 together with \u03b21 or \u03b22 with a pulse treatment, or by prolonged \u03b25 inhibition (s.c. bortezomib, orally administered ixazomib). In PI-resistant MM only dual \u03b22/\u03b25 inhibition is able to achieve meaningful cytotoxicity, which is provided by carfilzomib or marizomib.
