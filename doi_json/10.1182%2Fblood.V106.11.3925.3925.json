    "abstract_text": "A large number of CD4 + T-cells from either aged mice or humans display surface markers associated with an activated/memory phenotype. In spite of these changes however, these T-cells have a markedly decreased ability to proliferate and produce IL-2 in response to antigen stimulation in vitro . The cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this age-related unresponsiveness of the CD4 + T-cell compartment remain poorly understood. Utilizing a well-established experimental system in which transgenic CD4 + T cells specific for a MHC class II restricted epitope of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) are adoptively transferred into non-transgenic recipients, we have previously elucidated important mechanisms involved in the induction and maintenance of CD4 + T-cell tolerance. Our studies were however limited to the analysis of T-cell function in lymphoma bearing young mice (4 to 10 weeks old). Here, we assessed the influence of the aged microenvironment in determining the phenotype and function of antigen-specific T-cells. CD4 + T-cells from young TCR transgenic mice (2 months old) were adoptively transferred into either old (20\u201324 months) or young (2 months old) non-transgenic mice. Two weeks later, clonotypic and non-clonotypic CD4 + T-cells were isolated from the spleens of these animals and their phenotype and function were determined in vitro. Reminiscent of the age-related changes observed within the normal CD4 + T-cell repertoire, young transgenic T-cells transferred into aged hosts have acquired an activated/memory phenotype but displayed a significant impairment in antigen-specific proliferation and IL-2 production in response to cognate antigen in vitro . These changes were not due to homeostatic proliferation of the transferred T-cells into the relatively lymphopenic aged host. To determine whether the changes observed in \u201caged\u201d T-cells were reversible or not, we adoptively transfer old T-cells back into young hosts or into control old mice. While old transgenic T-cells transferred into an old environment remained fully unresponsive, the adoptive transfer of the same old T-cells into a young host restored their ability to proliferate and produce IL-2. Surprisingly, these \u201cold\u201d T-cells were able to produce significantly higher levels of IFN-gamma indicative of their memory/effector phenotype. Furthermore, young animals adoptively transferred with \u201caged\u201d antigen-specific T-cells were now capable of rejecting A20 B-cell lymphomas expressing HA as a model tumor antigen (A20HA). Taking together, factor(s) present in the aged microenvironment are responsible for limiting the effector function of CD4 + T-cells that seem otherwise well equipped to become fully activated if the proper environment is provided (young microenvironment). The potential role of soluble suppressive factors as well as regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in the unresponsiveness observed in the T-cell compartment of aged hosts will be discussed.",
