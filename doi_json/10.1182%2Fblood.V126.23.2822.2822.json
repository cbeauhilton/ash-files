    "abstract_text": "Introduction : The discovery of JAK2, MPL, and CALR mutations has significantly improved the diagnostic approach to BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Approximately 60% of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) harbor a JAK2 or MPL mutation. CALR mutations account for the majority of the remaining cases, and are found in 50-70% of ET and 60-90% of PMF cases that are negative for JAK2 and MPL mutations. Most CALR mutations cause a 52-bp deletion (type 1) or a 5-bp insertion (type 2). These mutations are acquired early during disease evolution and activate JAK/STAT signaling. Prior studies have shown that CALR type 1 mutations are associated with a favorable impact on survival of PMF patients, but not those with ET. Some data also suggested that CALR type 2 mutations may be associated with unfavorable prognosis in PMF. To assess the clinicopathologic impacts of CALR mutation subtypes in ET and PMF, we evaluated a series of CALR-mutated cases and correlated subtypes of mutations with several clinical, laboratory, and genetic parameters. Methods : MPN cases positive for CALR mutations were retrieved from our database over a period of 14 months. CALR, JAK2, and MPL mutation analyses were performed by either fragment analysis with Sanger sequencing confirmation or Next-Generation sequencing. Chromosome analysis and FISH with probes for 5p15/5q31, 7p11/7q31, 8cen, 20q, and t(9;22) were performed in all cases. Other parameters obtained included age, gender, hemoglobin, WBC, platelet count, bone marrow blasts and histology, and JAK2/MPL mutation status. The data were analyzed with independent sample t-tests and a 2-tailed chi-square test. Results : A total of 100 consecutive cases of CALR mutated MPNs were identified, 86 of which had available marrow specimens for morphologic subclassification. We further studied the cohort of 86 cases, including 37 ET and 49 PMF patients. 49 were male and 37 female with a median age of 67 (range 31-88) years. 49 (57%) patients had type 1, 28 (33%) had type 2, and 9 (10%) exhibited other types of mutations. No JAK or MPL mutation was found in any cases. Among patients with type 1 mutations, 22 (46%) were ET and 27 (54%) were PMF. Type 2 mutations were seen in 9 (33%) ET and 19 (67%) PMF patients. Notably, 5 cases of ET with type 2 mutations displayed atypical megakaryocytic hyperplasia with variable size and tight aggregates. In contrast, ET with type 1 mutations generally exhibited large megakaryocytes with hyperlobated nuclei. Two cases of PMF with type 2 mutations had a remote history of ET and may represent myelofibrotic transformation. ET patients with type 2 mutations had lower marrow cellularity (mean: 40% vs. 57%; p=0.014) than those with type 1 mutations. There were no statistically significant differences in age, gender, average hemoglobin, WBC, platelet count, marrow blasts, or reticulin fibrosis between the two ET subgroups. While no significant differences in various parameters were observed between PMF patients with type 1 and type 2 mutations, type 2 mutations showed a trend toward a higher platelet count (mean: 714 K/uL vs. 513 K/uL; p=0.086). Chromosome abnormalities were seen in 12 cases (23%), including 11 cases of PMF and 1 case of ET. Among PMF cases, cytogenetic abnormalities were less frequently associated with type 1 mutation (3/27) than type 2 and other types of mutations (8/22) (6% vs. 36%; p=0.035). The number of cases with other types of CALR mutations was small (3 ET and 6 PMF); therefore, comparison of those cases with cases from type 1 or type 2 mutated groups was precluded. Conclusions : ET patients with type 2 mutations showed less marrow cellularity and more megakaryocytic abnormalities associated with PMF compared to those with type 1 mutations. Our observations may raise the question whether ET patients with type 2 CALR mutations are more likely to progress to post-ET myelofibrosis. Type 2 mutations were also associated with a higher platelet count and higher frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities in PMF. Thus, CALR type 2 mutations may have a greater impact on megakaryocytic hyperplasia and platelet count production. We hypothesize that CALR type 1 and type 2 mutations represent different disease subgroups with pathogenic and prognostic implications. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
