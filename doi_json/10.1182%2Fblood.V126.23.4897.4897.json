    "abstract_text": "Xiaomei Chen and Jianyu Weng contributed equally to this study. The outcomes ofrelapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (RR-AML) are poor and effective salvage regimens are urgently needed. We present a study of 14 patients with RR-AML (median age 42years, range 18-65years; male n=12, female n= 2) treated with CLAT regimen, which consisted of cladribine 5mg/m\u00b2 per day i.v. 2-3 hour on days 1-5, cytarabine 1.0g/m\u00b2 per day i.v. 4 hours after cladribine on days 1-5, topotecan 1.25mg/m\u00b2 per day i.v. 4 hours after cytarabine on days1-5 and G-CSF 300ug per day subcutaneous injection on days until neutrophile granulocyte recovery. Total of fourteen patients were included into the study from June 2013 to June 2015, Two (14.3%) patients were relapsed and twelve (85.7%) patients were refractory, 4 of 14 patients were relapsed or refractory after allogeneic-HSCT. Two patients died of invasive fungal infection before the assessment. Seven patients (58.3%) achieved complete remission (CR), and one patient (8.3%) achieved partial remission (PR), the rest patients (33.3%) did not respond (NR). The overall response rate was 66.7%. Following CLAT treatment, four patients with CR underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or microtransplantation. The median relapse-free survival (RFS) for RR-AML patients receiving CLAT regimen was 8.6 (range 2-16) months. Thirteen patients developed grade 4 granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, the median duration was 13(range 2 to 21) days and12 (range 2 to 21) days, respectively. The most common non-hematological side effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and were grade 1/2. The CLAT regimen seems promising for the treatment of patients, and it was well tolerated. This regimen offers an alternative treatment for those patients with RR-AML who have received severe intensive treatment, especially with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy.
