    "abstract_text": "Introduction Systemic mastocytosis (SM) represents a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by accumulation of neoplastic mast cells (MCs) in one or more organ systems. Patients with SM present with a broad range of symptoms resulting from excessive mast cell mediator release, especially histamine, that frequently overlap with those of allergic disease. Episodes of life-threatening anaphylaxis are a recognized feature of SM. Here at St. Michael's Hospital we currently follow more than 50 SM patients, the largest patient cohort in Canada. Omalizumab is a subcutaneously administered monoclonal antibody which acts on circulating IgE, reducing binding to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FC \u03b5 R1) on mast cells, thereby reducing the potential reactivity of these cells. At St. Michael's Hospital, omalizumab is used as an add-on, off-label therapy in SM patients at risk for recurrent anaphylaxis. The efficacy of omalizumab treatment for SM patients remains unclear. Typically, highly symptomatic patients who are refractory to all other medication are candidates for omalizumab therapy. Objectives Our primary objective was to describe the response to treatment by omalizumab in patients with SM in a tertiary care centre. Our secondary objective was to compare the markers of disease in SM patients between those who were non-responsive versus responsive to omalizumab. The clinical and biological markers to be studied are symptoms and tryptase levels. Methods This is an observational, retrospective study (n=6) of SM patients treated with omalizumab at St. Michael's Hospital between January, 2014 and June, 2018. Electronic medical records were reviewed for mastocytosis treatment, symptom progression and tryptase levels, if available. All patients included in the study were diagnosed with SM according to the 2016 WHO criteria by undergoing a bone marrow biopsy. A baseline was established 2-5 months pre omalizumab exposure, as well as two follow-ups, each ranging from 2-8 months post omalizumab exposure (av. 4.7 months). The Brown Anaphylaxis score was used to capture severity of anaphylaxis. Mild (1), moderate (2), and severe (3) scores were associated with cutaneous manifestations, systemic (GI, respiratory, cardiovascular) involvement and systemic (hypoxia, hypotension, neurological compromise) collapse, respectively. Results Our study consisted of 4 females and 2 males, with an average age of 49 years old [IQR 36-74]. All 6 patients were diagnosed with indolent SM, the more moderate of the six SM subtypes. In every system, except for respiratory, it appears that symptoms decreased once therapy began. From baseline to first follow-up: all three patients who were experiencing systemic symptoms, three of the six manifesting cutaneous symptoms, and two of the three with cardiovascular involvement, responded fully to treatment. At second follow-up, patient 1 presented to clinic asymptomatically. Overall, 100% of patients responded to treatment with responses ranging from 17% to 100% improvement of mastocytosis-related symptoms. The grading of anaphylaxis severity reported three of the six patients improving from scores of 3 (severe) to 1 (mild). The other three patients remained at scores of 2. Patients 1 and 2 (only patients with available tryptase levels at both baseline and follow-up) saw a decrease in tryptase level from 134 to 84.1 and 11.4 to 8.3, respectively. Conclusions Omalizumab appears to be an effective therapy for patients with SM with anaphylaxis and reduces tryptase levels. It should be readily considered in the management of this population. Next steps include following these patients prospectively to better capture the efficacy of omalizumab within this population.
