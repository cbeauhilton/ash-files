    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Platelet function and mechanisms of platelet-leukocyte interactions have been investigated in several vascular und inflammatory disorders. In most studies, platelet activation and an increase of platelet-leukocyte-aggregates (PLA) could be observed. We investigated platelet function in clinically stable patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Methods: In addition to routine markers of inflammation (e. g. CRP, IgG, ESR) parameters of platelet function were measured in 54 clinically stable CF patients and 55 healthy controls (age range 3 to 41 years): The percentage of P-selectin (CD62P) and PAC-1 (activated integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 ) positive resting and activated platelets (in-vitro activation with the thrombin receptor activating peptide 6) and the number of PLA were determined by flow cytometry. The plasma markers of platelet activation soluble P-selectin (sCD62P) and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) were measured by ELISA. Furthermore, 15 CF patients and 14 healthy controls were investigated to determine CD41a-expression (integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 ) on resting and activated platelets as well as leukocyte expression of P-selectin-glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1, receptor of CD62P) and integrin \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 . Results: Chronic inflammation leads to a decrease of PAC-1-binding to resting and activated platelets. The effects were stronger in patients with higher markers of inflammation. CD41a expression was reduced on in-vitro-activated CF platelets. In contrast, proinflammatory platelet functions remained unchanged (CD62P-expression on resting and activated platelets) or increased (sCD62P, sCD40L, PLA). Leukocyte integrin \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 expression was increased and PSGL-1 expression remained unchanged in CF. Discussion: Platelet function in clinically stable patients with CF is differentially regulated: Chronic inflammation leads to an upregulation of platelet proinflammatory function. In the presence of several procoagulatory mechanisms in inflammation there is a compensatory loss of platelet hemostatic function, shown by the decreased activation and exocytosis of the platelet major integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 ."
