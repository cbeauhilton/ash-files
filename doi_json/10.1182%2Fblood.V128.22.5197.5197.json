    "abstract_text": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive malignant disease that accounts for about 15% of pediatric and 25% of adult ALL. Although risk stratification has provided more tailored therapy and improved the overall survival of T-ALL patients, clinical challenges such as suboptimal drug responses, morbidity from drug toxicities, and drug resistance still exist. Plant polyphenols have therapeutic efficacy as pharmacological adjuvants to help overcome these challenges. They can be acylated with fatty acids to overcome issues concerning bioavailability, such as poor intestinal absorption and low metabolic stability. Phloridzin (PZ), a flavonoid found in apple peels, was acylated with an omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), to generate a novel ester called phloridzin docosahexaenoate (PZ-DHA). The cytotoxic effect of PZ-DHA was studied in the human Jurkat T-ALL cell line. PZ-DHA significantly reduced the viability and cellular ATP levels of treated cells. PZ-DHA was found to selectively induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells, while sparing normal murine T-cells. Apoptosis was further confirmed by demonstrating the ability of PZ-DHA to induce morphological alterations, DNA fragmentation, caspase activation, and the release of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase. PZ-DHA also significantly inhibited cell division in Jurkat cells. Furthermore, interferon-\u03b1-induced phosphorylation of the transcription factor, STAT3, was downregulated following PZ-DHA treatment. The in vitro efficacy of PZ-DHA was recapitulated in vivo in an established zebrafish xenograft model, where the proliferation of transplanted Jurkat cells was inhibited when PZ-DHA was added to the embryo water. Overall, these findings provide evidence for PZ-DHA as a novel therapeutic agent with activity in T-ALL. Studies examining the effect of PZ-DHA on patient-derived ALL cells engrafted in zebrafish are currently underway. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
