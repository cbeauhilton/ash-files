    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2894 Poster Board II-870 Recent studies have identified TET2 and ASXL1 mutations in myeloid malignancies, suggesting that acquisition of these mutant alleles might precede the acquisition of JAK2 in some myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients. Moreover, the observation that JAK2 mutations are observed in minority of patients with leukemic transformation of JAK2 -mutant MPNs suggests the possibility that JAK2 mutations are dispensable for leukemic transformation. However the role of TET2 and ASXL1 mutations in leukemic transformation has not been evaluated. We therefore investigated the mutational status of JAK2, TET2, and ASXL1 in 63 patients with leukemic transformation from a pre-existing MPN, including 49 unpaired secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) samples and 14 patients for whom paired MPN and sAML samples were available. Mutations of TET2 and ASXL1 were found at a higher frequency in sAML samples transformed from MPNs than reported for sporadic MPNs (9/46 (19.6%) and 7/46 (15.2%), respectively). This was also higher than the mutational frequency of TET2 and ASXL1 in de novo AML (6.4% (3/47) and 4.3% (2/47), respectively) but similar to that of AML transformed from MDS (12.8% (5/39) and 15.4% (6/39)). All possible genetic combinations of JAK2 , TET2 , and ASXL1 status were observed in sAML patients. Analysis of paired samples reveal that TET2 mutations are far more likely to occur at leukemic transformation of MPN than at MPN diagnosis (p=0.013, Fisher's exact test) whereas ASXL1 mutations were equally likely to occur at MPN or sAML. Although mutations in JAK2 and in TET2 may not be retained at leukemic transformation from MPN, mutations in ASXL1 at MPN diagnosis were consistently retained at leukemic transformation. In addition, individual cases were observed where TET2 and/or ASXL1 mutations were found before acquisition of JAK2 mutations or clinical evidence of MPN, as well as cases where TET2 and ASXL1 mutations were acquired during leukemic transformation of a JAK2V617F-positive clone. These data suggest the mutational order of events in MPN and sAML pathogenesis might vary in different patients, and that TET2 and ASXL1 mutations might contribute in different patients to the development of MPN and/or to leukemic transformation. In addition, the identification of transformed AML cases with no evidence of pre-existing JAK2 , TET2 , and ASXL1 mutations indicates the existence of other, not yet identified, mutations necessary for leukemic transformation of MPNs.
