    "abstract_text": "In order to establish an efficient gd T cell-mediated immunotherapy for hematological malignancies, we tried to clarify whether \u03b3\u03b4 T cells could be expanded from blood cells of patients with myeloma, lymphoma and acute leukemia by culture with zoledronate and a low dose of IL-2 and whether the expanded patients\u2019 \u03b3\u03b4 T cells could kill tumor cells including self tumor cells with sparing normal clone cells. In addition, we explored the methods to enhance the anti-tumor cytotoxicity of the expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells by activating them with type I IFN, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs), or ab T cells. Although \u03b3\u03b4 T cells could be expanded in patients with myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia as well as normal persons, the amplification rates of gd T cells before and after the culture were varied from patient to patient in the patients with hematological malignancies. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells generated in patients with myeloma and lymphoma showed a potent cytotoxic ability against myeloma/lymphoma cell lines (RPMI8226, Daudi) as shown in \u03b3\u03b4 T cells generated in normal persons. In addition, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells generated in a patient with myeloma and acute leukemia showed a cytotoxic ability against self myeloma or leukemia cells freshly prepared from bone marrow. However, the same \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were not cytotoxic to normal lymphocytes of the patients. Then the expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were stimulated with type I IFN, mo-DCs, or \u03b1\u03b2 T cells and the activation (CD69 expression) and cytotoxicity against tumor cells were examined. By the stimulation with type I IFN, the expression of CD69 and Trail of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was increased and the cytotoxic ability of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was enhanced at dose-dependent manner of type I IFN. CD69 expression on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was enhanced by co-culture with both immature and mature mo-DCs in a cell-number-dependent fashion. CD69 expression was enhanced after the addition of mo-DCs of either autologous or allogeneic origin. Activation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with mo-DCs enhanced anti-tumor cytotoxicity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells against RPMI8226 and CML blastic crisis cell line (C2F8) in an effector-to-target ratio-dependent manner. Although CD69 expression of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was enhanced by the co-culture with allogeneic ab T cells, autologous ab T cells couldn\u2019t activate \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. However, autologous ab T cells stimulated with IL-2 or PHA could induce the activation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. The activation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with stimulated \u03b1\u03b2 T cells required cell-to-cell interaction. These findings suggested that \u03b1\u03b2 T cells stimulated by allogeneic \u03b3\u03b4 T cells could activate the same allogeneic \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. The present data demonstrated that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, which could be expanded in vitro from blood cells of the patients with myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia by culture with zoledronate and IL-2, possess an enough cytotoxic ability against tumor cells including self tumor cells with sparing normal cells. These findings suggested that in vitro generated patients\u2019 \u03b3\u03b4 T cells could be applied to \u03b3\u03b4 T cell-mediated immunotherapy for hematological malignancies. Besides, potent \u03b3\u03b4 T cells activated by type I IFN, mo-DCs or activated \u03b1\u03b2 T cells were considered to be applicable for \u03b3\u03b4 T cell-mediated immunotherapy.",
