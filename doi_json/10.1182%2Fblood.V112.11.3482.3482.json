    "abstract_text": "IL-17-producing CD4 T cells (Th17) are a recently identified T helper subset that plays a role in mediating host defense to extracellular bacteria infections and is involved in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. In vitro induction of IL-17 in murine CD4 + T cells has been shown to be dependent on the presence of the proinflammatory cytokines TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 whereas IFN\u03b3 can suppress the development of Th17 cells. In the current study, we examined the roles of TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 on IL-17 production by purified T cells in vitro and in vivo after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We present findings that expression of TNF\u03b1 by the T cell itself is necessary for optimal development of Th17 under in vitro polarizing conditions. A novel role for T cell-derived TNF\u03b1 in Th17 induction was observed when in vitro polarization of Tnf \u2212/\u2212 CD4 + T cells resulted in marked reductions in IL-17 + CD4 + T cells compared to Tnf +/+ CD4 + T cells. In marked contrast, T cell-derived IFN\u03b3 markedly inhibited Th17 development as more IL-17 + CD4 + T cells were found in Ifn \u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 CD4 + T cells than in Ifn \u03b3 +/+ CD4 + T cells, and of particular interest was the dramatic increase in IL-17 + CD8 + cells from Ifn \u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 mice. To determine if T cell-derived TNF\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 can regulate Th17 development in vivo we examined the differentiation of alloreactive donor T cells following allogeneic BMT. We have found that donor-derived Th17 cells can be found in lymphoid tissues and GVHD-affected organs after allogeneic BMT. However, transfer of Tnf \u2212/\u2212 CD4 + T cells after allogeneic BMT resulted in marked reductions in Th17 cells in the spleen (18\u00d710 3 vs 7\u00d710 3 , P<0.05). In agreement with the in vitro data and in contrast to what was observed with transfer of Tnf \u2212/\u2212 CD4 + T cells, transfer of donor Ifn \u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 T cells resulted in marked increases in not only IL-17 + CD4 + but also IL-17 + CD8 + T cells infiltrating the liver (7\u00d710 3 vs 14\u00d710 3 , P<0.05; 4\u00d710 4 vs 12.5\u00d710 4 , P<0.05). These results suggest that the donor T cell-derived TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 opposingly regulate IL-17 induction of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in vitro and after allogeneic BMT which correlates with GVHD pathology."
