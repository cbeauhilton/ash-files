    "abstract_text": "Tolerance to oral iron and low percentage of absorption in the gut has provoked the Iron Deficiency Anemia patients (IDA) fail to treatment or they have symptoms of anemia even more than 12 weeks until recovery. Intravenous iron is an alternative to minimize risk and treatment-related adverse effects and maximize profits in the short and long term. The number of patients who have access to ferumoxytol is reduced in developing countries, therefore experience in the treatment with this type of iron is limited. Patients received ferumoxytol 1020mg (two 510mg 8 days apart) and the response at 4 weeks of treatment by raising hemoglobin and clinical response was evaluated without transfusion support. From a total of 30 patients 76.6% (19) were women of whom 36.8% (7) were postmenopausal. The average age was 45.3 years (range 21-76 years). Before starting treatment, the mean serum iron, ferritin and rate of transferrin saturation was 35.6 mcg (range 8\u2013174 mcg/dL), 13.8 ng/mL (range 1.6\u201360 ng/mL), 10.8% (range 2-58%) respectively. The mean initial hemoglobin was 10.5 g / dL (range 7.1-13.7g/dL), reaching an average of 13.03 g dL (range 9.4 - 16 _g/dL) at 4 weeks, raising 2.52 g dL (0.3 - 5.4g / _ g/dL) in 28 days. The percentage of patients who achieved an increase of > 2 g/dL of hemoglobin was 70% (21). The initial symptoms attributed to anemia disappeared in 66.6% within the first 2 weeks and the rest in 4-5 weeks. Adverse effects more frequently than 2%: fatigue 16.6% (5), headache 10% (3), nausea and dizziness 10% (3), peripheral edema 6.6% (2) and hypersensitivity 3.3% (1). All previous were easily controlled with medications. Despite the low number of patients treated due to the difficult accessibility of the drug in our population, ferumoxytol was shown to be an attractive option that rapidly improves symptoms with a satisfactory safety profile.
