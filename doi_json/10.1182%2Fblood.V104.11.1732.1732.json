    "abstract_text": "A number of clinical studies have demonstrated correlation between elevated levels of factor IX and the risk of coronary heart disease. Studies by different groups have shown that blocking procoagulant activity of factor IX a could reduce the risk of thrombosis. We propose to study the regulation of factor IX a by phosphatidylserine (PS) which further could open up possibilities to design drugs that might inhibit the up regulation of the procoagulant protein factor IX a . The activated form of factor IX, IX a , forms the Xase complex together with factor VIII a and Ca 2+ on an activated platelet membrane surface. We hypothesize that PS regulates factor IX a by binding to specific sites on factor IX a and thereby enhancing its catalytic activity. We used a soluble form of phosphatidylserine, 1,2-dicaproyl- sn- glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (C6PS) as a tool in order to address the role of PS in regulating factor IX a . Intrinsic fluorescence measurements demonstrate that C6PS binds tightly (K d ~1.3 \u03bcM) to and induces changes in conformation of factor IX a . We also monitored the amidolytic activity of 300 nM factor IX a in the presence of C6PS using synthetic substrate Leu-PHG-Arg-pNA. There is a reduction in the amidolytic activity of factor IX a with increasing addition of C6PS and the hyperbolic fit gives an apparent K d of 130 \u03bcM. Recent results show that calcium is required for both amidolytic and proteolytic activity of factor IX a in the presence of C6PS. Our data shows that amidolytic activity of factor IX a in the presence of 600 mM C6PS is saturated at a concentration of calcium near 3 mM. We have also demonstrated that both C6PS and calcium enhance proteolytic activation of factor X by factor IX a . The data shows that as the concentration of Ca 2+ increases, the proteolytic activation of factor X by factor IX a increases as well. Enhancement of factor X activation appears to saturate at a calcium concentration of 3 mM. Based on these results, we conclude, 1) C6PS induces a conformational change in factor IX a , 2) C6PS regulates the amidolytic and proteolytic activity of factor IX a , 3) Ca 2+ is needed for PS mediated regulation of factor IX a ."
