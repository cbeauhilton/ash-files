    "abstract_text": "PU.1 (Sfpi1) is an ets family transcription factor required for the proper generation of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Distinct nuclear levels of PU.1 are required for macrophage differentiation (DeKoter 2000). MicroRNAs are a novel class of 22nt long non-coding post-transcriptional regulators, associated with differentiation, development and carcinogenesis. To identify miRNAs involved in PU.1 dependent hematopoietic differentiation we used PU.1-null hematopoietic progenitor cells stably expressing PU.1 fused to the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain inducible by tamoxifen (PUER) (Walsh 2002). PU.1 affected expression approximately 100 mature miRNA. Among them, we have observed that PU.1 downregulates members of miR-17~92 cluster and its paralog miR-106b~25 previously associated with macrophage differentiation, apoptosis and hematologic and other malignancies (Ota 2004, Hayashita 2005, Fontana 2008). During macrophage differentiation miR-17~92 becomes downregulated and its sustained expression is associated with the differentiation block (Fontana 2007). In tamoxifen-stimulated PUER cells, PU.1 efficiently downregulates mature miRNAs of the miR-17~92 (-17.5p, -20a, -92) cluster and its paralog miR-106b~25 (but not miR-106a~363) within 96 hours and in dose dependent manner. PU.1 in the same cells activates expression of Egr2, myeloid transcription factor promoting macrophage transcriptional program a putative 8-mer-seed sequence-containing target of miR-17~92 cluster (predicted by TargetScan). We tested whether PU.1 represses expression of miR-17~92 cluster by inducing Egr2. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of Egr2 in unstimulated PUER cells inhibited expression of miR-17~92 cluster, both at the levels of mature miRs and pri-miRNAs, and induced expression of macrophage differentiation markers (Cd14, Csf1r) coupled with cell cycle arrest. Trichostatin-dependent derepression of miR-17~92 indicated that its expression is regulated at the chromatin level. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed specific Egr2 occupancy within the regulatory region upstream of the miR-17~92 cluster. Our data indicate that in differentiating cells, a mechanism exists involving direct repression of the miR-17~92 cluster that in turn has the potential to inhibit Egr2 expression. We have tested this mechanisms in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (N=9) where levels of PU.1 and Egr2 are significantly lower that in normal controls. 5 out of 9 AML patients significantly overexpressed miR- 17.5p, miR-20a, miR-92 coinciding with downregulation of its established targets p21 and BIM. Rescue of Egr2 in AML cells (N=2) led to downregulation of miR-17~92 cluster and upregulation of BIM mRNA levels coincident with induction of apoptosis. We conclude that PU.1 regulates transcription of the miR-17~92 cluster by inducing Egr2 and demonstrate this mechanism in differentiating macrophages and its disruption in AML cells.",
