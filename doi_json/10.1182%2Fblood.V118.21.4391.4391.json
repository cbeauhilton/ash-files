    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4391 Background: High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous transplantation of peripheral blood stem cells plays an important role in the management of intermediate- and advanced-stage multiple myeloma. In order for successful engraftment to occur, adequate numbers of high quality peripheral stem cells must be harvested prior to transplantation. Mobilization of PBSC in patients treated with lenalidomide has been associated with poor apheresis collections after G-CSF mobilization. The purpose of this study is to present our institution\u2019s experience utilizing an intermediate-dose cyclophosphamide-based mobilization regimen. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data for patients with multiple myeloma who underwent autologous stem cell transplant at UCLA between 2006 and 2010. Data were obtained from the database of the UCLA Heme Malignancy/Stem Cell Transplant Unit, the electronic health record system and stem cell processing laboratory. All patients underwent mobilization with a regimen of cyclophosphamide 2.5g/m 2 IVPB, G-CSF 10 mcg/kg/day for 4 days SQ, and prednisone 2mg/kg/day for 4 days po. The number of CD 34+ cells was used as a marker for the number of peripheral stem cells collected. Minimum dose collected to ensure adequate engraftment was 2\u00d710 6 /kg CD34+ cells. Patients were conditioned with melphalan 100mg/m 2 /d x2 (unless there was evidence of renal failure, in which case the dose was reduced to 100mg/m 2 ) with subsequent infusion of stem cells. Neutrophil engraftment was defined as the first day of absolute neutrophil count greater than 500\u00d710 6 /L \u2265 7 days after transplant. Results: Autologous stem cell transplant was performed in 103 patients with multiple myeloma at UCLA between 2006 and 2010. Median number of apheresis procedures was 1 (1\u201312) with a median of 4.4\u00d710 6 /kg (1.4\u201333.5) CD34+ cells collected. Median time to engraftment was 10 (8\u201318) days. Thirty-five patients received lenalidomide at some point in their pretransplant treatment. Median number of apheresis procedures was 1 in both lenalidomide and non lenalidomide treated groups. In the lenalidomide treated group 54% required only one collection versus 75% in the non lenalidomide treated group (p=0.033). In the lenalidomide treated group 31% required 3 more or more collections versus 10% in non lenalidomide treated group (p=0.0075). Three patients in the lenalidomide group had subsequent mobilization with plerixafor with one of these requiring bone marrow harvesting. Median CD34+ cells collected was 3.5\u00d710 6 /kg and 4.9\u00d710 6 /kg (p=0.246) in the lenalidomide and non-lenalidomide groups respectively. Both groups had a median time to neutrophil engraftment of 10 days with a similar range. Conclusion: Pre-transplant use of lenalidomide adversely affected the number of stem cell apheresis procedures required to procure adequate stem cell dose as evidenced by a greater percentage requiring 3 or more collections. However, despite prior lenalidomide exposure, the use of our mobilization regimen permitted adequate collection, with the majority of patients requiring only one apheresis procedure, and led to an equivalent time to neutrophil recovery. Disclosures: Off Label Use: Cyclophosphamide and G-CSF for mobilization of stem cells."
