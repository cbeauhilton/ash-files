    "abstract_text": "Panobinostat (LBH589) is a highly potent pan-deacetylase inhibitor (DACi), which induces cytotoxicity at 1500 post dose ECGs, 1 pt showed a Grade 2 prolongation of QTcF value above 480 ms, 2 pts had a QTcF increase of \u226560 ms compared to baseline, and 10 pts had a minimal 30\u201312 months is continuing to show clinical benefit after failing 10 prior lines of therapy (including Auto-SCT, bortezomib, lenalidomide, and thalidomide) and is maintaining MR. Stable disease observations of >3 months occurred in 3 pts. Single-agent, oral panobinostat at 20 mg/day thrice weekly was well tolerated and safe in this study. Evidence has since been obtained from clinical responses in patients with various hematological malignancies that higher doses of single-agent panobinostat can provide more optimal dosing schedules than the 20 mg dose. Thus, although the current study at the 20 mg schedule did not meet its objective, the observation of 1 durable VGPR and 1 durable and ongoing MR, in addition to transient disease stabilization in 3/38 patients, are encouraging results, especially at this low dose, warranting further clinical investigation of panobinostat. The analysis of final study results will be presented."
