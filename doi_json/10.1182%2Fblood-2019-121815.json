    "abstract_text": "Background: Some patients receiving a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for chronic phase (CP) Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) experience drug intolerance and require switching to an alternative TKI. Bosutinib, a TKI approved for newly diagnosed CP Ph+ CML and Ph+ CML resistant/intolerant to prior therapy, has a distinct adverse event (AE) profile vs other TKIs used to treat Ph+ CML. Methods: The ongoing phase 4 BYOND study (NCT02228382) is further evaluating efficacy and safety of bosutinib for CML resistant/intolerant to prior TKIs. Patients with Ph+ CP CML (n=156) previously treated with imatinib, dasatinib, and/or nilotinib received bosutinib (starting dose 500 mg once daily). Cross-intolerance (AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of both prior TKI and bosutinib), recurrent AEs (grades 1/2 or 3/4), and bosutinib dose modifications due to recurrent AEs were assessed across AEs and AE clusters. This analysis was based on \u22651 year after the last enrolled patient (median treatment duration 23.7 months [range 0.2-42.2]). Results: Of 141, 95, and 79 patients who received prior imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib, respectively, 63 (45%), 70 (74%), and 60 (76%) were intolerant and discontinued treatment due to an AE as the primary reason. 1 (2%) imatinib-intolerant and 5 (7%) dasatinib-intolerant patients had cross-intolerance with bosutinib; no cross-intolerance with bosutinib was reported for the 60 nilotinib-intolerant patients (Table). 15 patients discontinued >1 TKI due to the same AE. Of these, only 1 with prior imatinib and dasatinib intolerance due to anemia (below), was cross-intolerant to bosutinib. No deaths occurred due to cross-intolerance to bosutinib. Imatinib-intolerant: The most common cause of imatinib intolerance was musculoskeletal pain in 19 patients. Of these, 9 patients experienced grade 1/2 recurrence and 1 had a grade 3/4 AE. There was no cross-intolerance with bosutinib due to musculoskeletal pain. 6 patients were intolerant due to edema, which recurred as grade 1/2 in 3 bosutinib-treated patients. In 2 patients with intolerance due to diarrhea, both had grade 1/2 diarrhea with bosutinib. 2 patients were imatinib-intolerant due to neutropenia or thrombocytopenia (n=1 each) and experienced grade 3/4 recurrence with bosutinib. 1 patient was cross-intolerant to bosutinib due to anemia. Dasatinib-intolerant: The most common reason for prior dasatinib intolerance was pleural effusion. Of 36 patients, 10 (28%) had recurrence of grade 1/2 AE and 4 (11%) had grade 3/4 AE with bosutinib that caused dose delay and reduction in 6 (17%) and 4 (11%) patients, respectively. 1 patient had cross-intolerance with bosutinib due to pleural effusion. Of 8 patients dasatinib-intolerant due to dyspnea, 1 had cross-intolerance with bosutinib (this patient also developed pleural effusion with dasatinib). Of 2 patients with dasatinib intolerance due to pulmonary hypertension, 1 had grade 1/2 and 1 had grade 3/4 recurrence with bosutinib, leading to cross-intolerance in 1 patient. 2 other dasatinib-intolerant patients experienced cross-intolerance due to anemia and nausea (n=1 each). Grade 3/4 recurrence of thrombocytopenia was experienced in 1 of 3 patients with prior dasatinib-intolerance. 1 patient with dasatinib intolerance due to diarrhea had grade 3/4 diarrhea with bosutinib that was managed with dose delay/reduction. Nilotinib-intolerant: 6 patients discontinued nilotinib due to peripheral ischemia, of whom 1 experienced grade 3/4 recurrence with bosutinib. None of the 4 patients with nilotinib intolerance due to acute coronary syndrome had recurrence with bosutinib. Of 3 patients with prior intolerance due to pancreatitis, 1 had grade 3/4 recurrence with bosutinib. 2 patients had recurrent diarrhea with bosutinib, both grade 1/2. There were no bosutinib dose reductions, delays, or recurrence of AEs in patients with prior nilotinib intolerance due to rash, hematologic AEs, hepatotoxicity, or metabolic disorders. Conclusions: Incidence of cross-intolerance, dose delay, or dose reduction with bosutinib in patients intolerant to prior TKIs was low. Despite recurrence of certain same grade 1/2 or grade 3/4 AEs that caused prior TKI intolerance, these were manageable and patients were able to remain on bosutinib. These findings support the use of bosutinib in patients with CP Ph+ CML intolerant to prior TKI treatment.
