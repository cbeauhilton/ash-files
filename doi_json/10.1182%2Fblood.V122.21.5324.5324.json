    "abstract_text": "Introduction Renal impairment (RI) in patients with MM is detrimental organ damage. The estimation of glomerular filtration (eGFR) rates is based on using different equations such as CKD-EPI, MDRD or Cockcroft-Gault (CG). Methods: We enrolled 132 consecutive MM patients treated with lenalidomide for the approved indication in our department between 2006 and 2012. The GFR for quantifying RI was estimated by the CKD-EPI, MDRD- and CG-equations at baseline and after 3 months under lenalidomide therapy. We assessed hematological response by the EBMT criteria, and renal response according to recently proposed criteria (Dimopolous et al. Leukemia 2013) and by comparing the CKD-EPI, MDRD- and CG equations. Results Median patient age was 64 years (range 41-90; males 62%) with predominantly advanced stage II/III Durie & Salmon and International Staging System disease (96% vs. 65%, respectively). Fifty-four MM patients had received \u22652 therapy lines and 50% prior stem cell transplantation. The median lenalidomide dose was 25mg (D1-21/28 day cycle) given with dexamethasone (Rd) as published. The median serum creatinine was normal at 1.0mg/dl, whereas the median eGFR showed CKD stage 2, with substantially different median CKD-EPI, MDRD and CG equations of 77, 81 and 74ml/min/1.73m 2 , respectively ( Figure 1A ). For each equation, the number of patients with CKD stage 3\u20135 via CKD-EPI, MDRD and CG equation was 32%, 23% and 30%, respectively ( Table 1 ). In total, 26 (20%) MM patients with eGFR values by the MDRD equation were reclassified to higher CKD-stages according to CKD-EPI equation and 3 (2%) to lower CKD stages ( Figure 1B ). This demonstrates that the MDRD may substantially overestimate the GFR, especially in elderly patients with normal or less impaired renal function (GFR >60ml/min/1.73m 2 ). Best overall response (ORR=CR+PR) and clinical benefit rate (CR, PR, SD) in this advanced, substantially pretreated cohort was 48% and 93%, respectively. After 3 months, renal response (CR, PR, MR) according to CKD-EPI, MDRD and CG were 17%, 11% and 15%, respectively, and renal response defined as any eGFR improvement was 52%, 51% and 51%, respectively. For each eGFR equation, the number of patients with renal improvement according to CKD stage 1-2 was more pronounced with the CKD-EPI (68% \u2192 76%), less with the MDRD (77% \u2192 83%) and least with the CG equation (70% \u2192 75%; Table 1 ).

In these substantially pretreated MM patients, renal response under lenalidomide was seen via CKD-EPI in 17% and any eGFR improvements in 52%, indicating that Rd in these patients is effective and RI best defined via CKD-EPI. Our results enlarge the arsenal of available eGFR equations by the CKD-EPI formula. Disclosures: Kleber: Celgene: Educational grant Other. Engelhardt: Celgene: Educational grant Other.",
