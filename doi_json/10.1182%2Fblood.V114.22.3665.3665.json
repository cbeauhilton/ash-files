    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3665 Poster Board III-601 Introduction Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells are originated from germinal center B cells. Constitutive nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation is one of the molecular characteristic futures of H-RS cells. TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs) participate in a wide range of biological processes, such as adaptive and innate immunity, stress response, and bone metabolism, which are mediated by the induction of cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Among those, TRAF3 are reported as a negative regulator of the alternative NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in B cells. How TRAF3 functions in H-RS cells is currently unclear. Methods Electromobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed to examine the NF-\u03baB activity in B cell-derived Hodgkin's cells (L428 and KM-H2). An ELISA-based NF-\u03baB family transcription factor activity assay was performed to quantify NF-\u03baB DNA-binding in nuclear extracts from L428 cells. p100 processing, the expression of other NF-\u03baB family members in the cytoplasm, and TRAF3 expression were detected by Western blot analysis. The effects of TRAF3 in L428 cells were studied by transient expression of TRAF3 expression vector. Results In this study, we found that TRAF3 was minimally detected in B cell-derived Hodgkin's cell lines (L428 and KM-H2) either in mRNA or protein levels. Both the classical (p50-RelA) and the alternative (p52-RelB) NF-kB activity were consistently activated in L428 cells, measured by EMSA and TransAM NF-kB activity assay. The enhanced alternative NF-\u03baB activity, accompanied by increased p100 processing and RelB accumulation in the cytoplasm were detected in L428 cells. Transient transfection of TRAF3-expression vector enforced the expression of TRAF3 and blocked the p100 processing in L428 cells. The alternative NF-kB activity was partially decreased whereas the classical NF-kB activity remained intact. In addition, the increased TRAF3 expression did not affect the anti-apoptotic effects in L428 cells. Conclusions Not only the classical NF-\u03baB activity but also the alternative NF-\u03baB activity characterized by p100 processing and p52-RelB nuclear localization is constitutively activated in B cell-derived lymphoma cells. Lack of TRAF3 expression might be one of the reasons for the aberrant expression of alternative NF-\u03baB activity. TRAF3 is indeed an important molecule regulating the activation of the alternative NF-kB activity but not the classical NF-kB activity in H-RS cells.
