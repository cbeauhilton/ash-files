    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis (MF) are Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) leading to risk of vascular events, splenomegaly and cytopenias in advanced disease as well as disease-originating symptoms, including (but not limited to) fatigue, depressive symptoms, insomnia, inactivity, sexual problems, and pruritis. Current therapy with JAK inhibition has improved MPN symptom burden, yet even in responders, unmet needs remain for alleviating fatigue, mood related symptoms, and insomnia. Yoga used as non-pharmacologic therapy has been shown to be efficacious for improving anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and fatigue in other cancer populations, including hematological malignancies. Due to a lack of this type of research in MPN patients, we undertook the first yoga study in this population as a feasibility trial (i.e., acceptability, demand, practicality) of home-based, online-streamed yoga for improving MPN patient symptom burden. Methods: MPN patients were recruited nationally using social media. Participants were asked to complete 60 minutes of online-streamed yoga weekly for 12 weeks. The yoga video selection included MPN-specific videos as well as others chosen specifically with potential splenomegaly in mind. Additionally, participants were asked to complete online self-report surveys administered via Qualtrics. Survey measures included demographics, total symptom burden and fatigue (MPN Symptom Assessment Form [MPN SAF]) as well as NIH PROMIS measures of pain, anxiety, depression, sleep, and sexual function. Surveys were administered at baseline (week 0), mid-point (week 7), post-intervention (week 12), and follow-up (week 16). Weekly yoga minutes were collected through online self-report. Results : Patients: Two hundred and forty-four MPN patients completed the eligibility survey, 134 were eligible, 55 completed the informed consent, and 38 MPN patients completed the 12-week intervention. The majority of participants were diagnosed with either PV (n=16) or ET (n=16), with MF being less common (n=6). Additionally, the majority of participants were female (n=34), Caucasian (n=37), married (n=30) of a normal BMI category (n=26), and had attained a Bachelor's degree or higher (n=25). Median age of those participating was 56 years (range 29-72). Yoga Participation & Safety: Approximately 37% (n=14) of study participants averaged \u226560 min/week of yoga. Yoga participation averaged 50.8\u00b136.2 min/week. Additionally, 75% of participants felt safe from injury while participating in online yoga. Only one adverse event was reported (irritated enlarged spleen). Feasibility: Overall, 68% of participants were either satisfied or very satisfied with online yoga and 75% felt that is was helpful for coping with MPN-related symptoms (i.e., acceptability, practicality). However, only 43% of participants reported that they were likely or very likely to continue their online yoga practice (i.e., demand). Impact of Yoga Intervention: From baseline (week 0) to post-intervention (week 12, n=30), there were significant improvements in total symptom burden (effect size [ES] in standard deviation units=-0.36, p=0.004), anxiety (ES=-0.67, p=0.002), depression (ES=-0.41, p=0.049), sleep (ES=-0.58, p<0.001), and fatigue (ES=-0.33, p=0.04). These improvements remained significant at follow-up (week 16, n=28) for all outcome measures with a trend for maintained fatigue improvement (ES=-0.34, p=0.06). There were no significant differences in outcomes between those that averaged <60 min/week of yoga compared to those that averaged \u226560 min/week of yoga. Conclusions: A 12-week, home-based, online-streamed yoga intervention is feasible (i.e., accepted, practical) for MPN patients. Although the sample size was small and there was no control group, the results suggest that online yoga may be effective for improving MPN symptom burden, with statistically significant improvements observed in total symptom burden, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep. A randomized, controlled trial is warranted to evaluate home-based, online-streamed yoga on MPN patient outcomes. If effective, yoga may represent a unique non-pharmacologic complement to standard therapies in a population with a heterogeneous symptom profile and significant symptom burden.
