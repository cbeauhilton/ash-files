    "abstract_text": "Peripheral T- and NK-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are fatal in the majority of patients, and conventional chemotherapy is minimally effective. Targeted inhibition of tyrosine kinases (TKs) might be a useful treatment strategy, but TK overexpression by PTCLs has not been well characterized (except ALK). Recently a novel translocation t(5;9) fusing the ITK and SYK genes was reported in a subset of unspecified-type PTCLs, associated with high SYK gene expression and Syk protein positivity. Syk is a non-receptor TK important in immunoreceptor signal transduction, providing proliferation and survival signals in a variety of hematopoietic cells. Syk is absent or expressed at very low levels in most normal post-thymic T cells, where this signal transduction role is fulfilled by ZAP70. Since Syk TK inhibitors are now in clinical trials for other diseases, we sought to determine the incidence of t(5;9) and Syk overexpression in PTCL. Tissue microarrays were constructed using triplicate cores from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. Cases were studied using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Additional studies were performed using flow cytometry and Western blot. There were 141 PTCLs, including 35 angioimmunoblastic, 66 unspecified, 21 anaplastic large cell, 2 enteropathy-associated, 5 hepatosplenic, 5 extranodal NK/T, and 7 other. No evidence of t(5;9) was identified by FISH in 86 informative cases. Normal T-cell subsets from peripheral blood, spleen, and lymph node were negative for Syk by IHC, flow cytometry, and Western blot. Syk was positive by immunohistochemistry in 133 of 141 (94%) PTCLs. All 8 Syk negative cases were extranodal, cytotoxic PTCLs. Western blot on frozen tissue correlated with IHC results in paraffin. All 4 Syk-positive cases tested showed phosphorylation of tyrosine residues 525/526, known to be required for Syk activation. We conclude that Syk is overexpressed in most PTCLs, including the vast majority of nodal cases. Syk may substitute for ZAP70 in these tumors and provide ongoing proliferation and survival signaling. The overexpression of Syk and phosphorylation of its Y525/526 residues suggest Syk may be a suitable target for pharmacologic TK inhibition as a treatment option for patients with PTCL."
