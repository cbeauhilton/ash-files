    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4180 Oncogenic NRAS mutations are frequently identified in myeloid diseases involving monocyte lineage. However, its role in the genesis of these diseases remains elusive. We report a mouse bone marrow transplantation model harboring an oncogenic G12D mutation in the Nras locus. Approximately 95% of recipient mice develop a myeloproliferative disease resembling the myeloproliferative variant of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), with a prolonged latency and acquisition of multiple genetic alterations, including uniparental disomy of oncogenic Nras allele. Based on single-cell profiling of phospho-proteins, a novel population of CMML cells is identified to display aberrant GM-CSF signaling in both the ERK1/2 and Stat5 pathways. This abnormal signaling is acquired during CMML development. Further study suggests that aberrant Ras/ERK signaling leads to expansion of granulocytic/monocytic precursors, which are highly responsive to GM-CSF. Hyperactivation of Stat5 in CMML cells is mainly through expansion of these precursors rather than upregulation of surface expression of GM-CSF receptor. Our results provide insights into the aberrant cytokine signaling in oncogenic Nras-associated myeloid diseases. Our mouse model will serve as a powerful system to identify and validate cooperating mutations of oncogenic Nras in myeloid leukemias as well as assess the therapeutic efficacy of molecular agents in treating these leukemias.
