    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2876 Background: B-CLL follows a variable clinical course, with a subset of patients progressing quickly. The reasons for this outcome disparity are not fully understood; however, evidence suggests that B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is a driving event in disease onset and progression. B-CLL cells also receive survival signals through additional receptors. SCNP is a multiparametric flow cytometry-based assay that measures, quantitatively at the single cell level, changes in intracellular signaling proteins in response to extracellular modulators. This provides a functional measure of pathway activity and intraclonal signaling differences within the larger B-CLL cell population. In prior studies, we observed higher \u03b1IgM-induced (\u2192) p-ERK signaling in B-CLL samples from patients who had a shorter time to first treatment (TTFT) (Cesano et al. ASH 2011 Abstract 2834). Herein we examined the feasibility for SCNP to further define patient risk stratification. Objectives: The current study was designed to 1) map signaling profiles in early-stage B-CLL and to 2) identify signaling associations with clinical subgroups defining B-CLL prognosis ( IGHV mutational status, cytogenetic risk, CD38 / ZAP-70 expression). Methods: Between 2006 and 2007, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected and cryopreserved from a cohort of 39 untreated B-CLL patients, Rai stage 0 - II, at different time points during their clinical course. Of the 39 samples evaluated; 15 and 20 expressed CD38 (\u226530% of cells) and ZAP-70 (\u226520% of cells), respectively; 19 were IGHV unmutated (98% cutoff); and cytogenetic risk groups were evenly represented. SCNP analysis quantitatively measured 22 intracellular signaling proteins within CD19 + CD5 + B-CLL cells, using a panel of 14 disease-relevant modulators. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to identify signaling associations with CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, cytogenetic risk categories, del17p (includes p53 gene deletion) and IGHV mutational status. Results: Significant associations between patient risk categories and signaling are summarized in Table 1 . IGHV unmutated and ZAP-70 + samples showed (1) elevated \u03b1-IgM or \u03b1-IgD-induced BCR signaling, either alone or in combination, (2) decreased CpG\u03b2 \u2192 p-ERK induction and (3) increased thapsigargin-induced (Ca 2+ signaling) signaling. Of note, CD38 + samples did not show the same associations, but shared with unmutated IGHV samples a higher responsiveness to IFN\u03b1 and weaker induction of p21 in response to bendamustine. The unfavorable cytogenetic group samples showed increased \u03b1IgM\u2192p-ERK and had higher basal p-S6 that further increased with IgD crosslinking. Lack of p21 induction was also associated with unfavorable cytogenetics, which includes deletion of p53 (del17p), a regulator of p21 expression. Table 1.

View Large Conclusions: This is the second, independent SCNP analysis of B-CLL signaling showing decreased bendamustine\u2192p21 and increased \u03b1IgM\u2192p-ERK signaling in samples with unfavorable cytogenetics. Further associations with IGHV unmutated status included increased BCR signaling in multiple nodes, altered TLR9 responsiveness, and decreased drug-induced p21. These data support the potential utility of SCNP in: (1) identifying in one assay those patients with a more aggressive form of B-CLL, including both unmutated IGHV and p53 pathway alteration, and (2) identification of patients with signaling profiles that may be more likely to respond to targeted therapies.
