    "abstract_text": "Background: PIOL, now named \u201cprimary vitreo-retinal lymphoma\u201d, i s a very rare s ub s et of non Hodgkin lymphoma, usually arising in elderly patients and characterized by a high level of relapse, mainly in the first year, with more than 20% of ca s e s relap s ing in brain, and a short survival. There i s no con s en s u s on treatment procedure s , even in first line, and prospective comparative studies do not exist. Cla ss ical attitude s are s y s temic chemotherapy ( S C), often high dose methotrexate, radiotherapy or intraocular injection of methotrexate but publication on R/R PIOL are exceptional. New treatment s are nece ss ary, e s pecially with a good tolerance profile. As Temozolomide (Te) ha s s ome efficiency on primary-central-nervous-system lymphoma (PCNSL) we used this drug in R/R PIOL in our center. Methods: Inclu s ion criteria were R/R PIOL and/or PIOL not eligible for IV chemotherapy. Diagno s i s was e s tabli s hed on cytological and molecular analy s i s after vitrectomy, and the ab s ence of brain or meningeal localization verified by MRI and lumbar puncture. Treatment con s i s ted in Te at 150mg/m 2 orally 5 day s per month, without cortico s teroid u s e, in absence of any response, dosage was increased to 200mg/m\u00b2. A complete response was defined as a normalization of eye exam and intraocular interleukins 10 and 6 levels. Results: Sixteen patient s were analyzed, 3 male s and 13 females, mean age 75 years [35-90]. All but two received s y s temic chemotherapy with at lea s t high do s e methotrexate and high do s e cytarabin before Te, 8 were in second line, 4 in third, with 1 patient who relapsed after autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) conditioned by thiotepa, cyclophosphamide and busulfan, and 2 in forth. The 2 patients treated in first line where more than 80 years old. Median duration of treatment was 5 months. The median follow-up (fu) is 16 months. Overall response rate is 75%, with 10 CR (63%) and 2 PR (13%). At the last fu, 7 patients are still in CR, with a median DFS of 13 months. The patient treated after ASCT relapse is still in CR at 62 months. The two old patients treated in first line are in CR at last fu. Two patients where treated a second time by Te after relapse, obtaining 2 new CR, one of 4 months, one persistent at 14 months. Median OS is not reached. Only 3 patients experienced hematological grade 3/4 toxicity. Conclusion: This work represents the biggest study with an homogeneous treatment in R/R PIOL. Temozolomide appears as a s afe and efficient treatment of R/R PIOL or in first line in patients in bad condition, even after high dose chemotherapy and/or in elderly patients. Longer follow-up, prospective and larger s tudie s are nece ss ary to confirm the s e data Disclosures Leblond: Roche: Honoraria, Speakers Bureau.",
