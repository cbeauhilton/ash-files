    "abstract_text": "Emicizumab (also termed ACE910) is a humanized anti-factor (F)IXa/FX bispecific antibody with FVIIIa cofactor function. A clinical phase 3 study was initiated in 2015 for hemophilia A patients (HA-pts) with FVIII inhibitors. Since emicizumab, unlike FVIII, does not require activation by thrombin, its APTT-shortening effect is much greater than that of FVIII. Thus, APTT, a conventional assay to assess whole coagulation potency, would have limited utility in emicizumab-administered HA-pts, because emicizumab would mask the effect of residual FVIII or a FVIII agent on APTT. Clot waveform analysis (CWA) can provide multidimensional coagulation potencies by monitoring the process of plasma clot formation with an automated coagulation analyzer. We considered the possibility, therefore, that this assay system would overcome the above issue on APTT. In this study, we aimed to optimize concentrations of tissue factor (TF) and ellagic acid (Elg) in a trigger reagent for CWA as well as CWA parameters to provide precise evaluation of coagulation potency even in the presence of emicizumab with neither masking nor being masked by FVIII or bypassing agents. First, we determined an optimal concentration of TF/Elg trigger reagent. Various concentrations (10, 30, 100, and 300 \u03bcg/mL) of emicizumab were spiked into commercially available FVIII-deficient plasmas (George King) for testing. Recombinant (r)FVIII (Kogenate FS; Bayer)-spiked samples were also tested as a reference. PT reagent (under development; Sysmex) and APTT reagent (Thrombocheck APTT-SLA; Sysmex), used as a source of TF and Elg, respectively, were mixed in various ratios. The optimized mixture ratio (PT:APTT:buffer=1:15:135) was chosen to ensure that the maximum coagulation velocity (|min1|) in the presence of emicizumab would be in agreement with the animal study-based estimated conversion rate \"0.2-0.4 IU/dL of equivalent FVIII per 1 \u03bcg/mL of emicizumab\" (Muto. J Thromb Haemost. 2014). When evaluating several lots of FVIII-deficient plasmas, however, we observed large variations in transmittance depending on fibrinogen concentration of each plasma, which resulted in large variations of |min1| between donor plasmas. To decrease the bias due to fibrinogen concentration, % transmittance of clot waveform (CW) was adjusted to 100% and 0% at the pre- and post-coagulation phase, respectively. By using |min1| from the adjusted CW (adjusted-|min1|), we successfully reduced the inter-donor variations and chose it as a main parameter. Next, we evaluated adjusted-|min1| using plasmas from HA-pts without inhibitors (severe; n=2, moderate; n=2) and HA-pts with inhibitors (10 BU/mL; n=2) by adding emicizumab (30, 100, and 300 \u03bcg/mL) in vitro. After the addition of emicizumab, concentration-dependent increases in adjusted-|min1| were observed in all plasmas with rather small individual variations. Finally, we examined whether adjusted-|min1| reflected the effects of FVIII or bypassing agent that was added to plasmas containing emicizumab. Additive effects of a plasma-derived FVIII agent (CROSS EIGHT M; Japan Blood Products Organization), a rFVIII agent (ADVATE; Baxalta) and activated prothrombin complex concentrate (FEIBA; Baxalta) were confirmed by the increase of adjusted-|min1|. As for rFVIIa agent (NovoSeven; Novo Nordisk), its additive effect on adjusted-|min1| was not clear enough in this assay condition, but its additive effects were confirmed by the clot time. In conclusion, we established the Elg/TF-triggered CWA assay condition and parameters for measuring coagulation potency in plasmas from HA-pts even in the presence of emicizumab and a FVIII/bypassing agent without masking each other.
