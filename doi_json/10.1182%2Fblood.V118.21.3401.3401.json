    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3401 Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are responsible for the continual production of all mature blood cells during homeostasis and times of stress. These cells are known to be regulated in part by the bone marrow microenvironment in which they reside. We have previously reported that the microenvironmentally-produced factor Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) expands HSPCs when administered systemically in nai\u0308ve mice (Porter, Frisch et. al., Blood, 2009). However, the mechanism mediating this expansion remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that in vivo PGE2 treatment inhibits apoptosis of HSPCs in nai\u0308ve mice, as measured by Annexin V staining (p=0.0083, n=6\u20137 mice/group) and detection of active-Caspase 3 (p=0.01, n=6\u20137 mice/group). These data suggest that inhibition of apoptosis is at least one mechanism by which PGE2 expands HSPCs. Since PGE2 is a local mediator of injury and is known to play a protective role in other cell types, we hypothesized that it could be an important microenvironmental regulator of HSPCs during times of injury. Thus, these studies explored the role of PGE2 signaling in the bone marrow following myelosuppressive injury using a radiation injury model. Endogenous PGE2 levels in the bone marrow increased 2.9-fold in response to a sub-lethal dose of 6.5 Gy total body irradiation (TBI)(p=0.0004, n=3\u201311 mice/group). This increase in PGE2 correlated with up-regulation of microenvironmental Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) mRNA (p=0.0048) and protein levels at 24 and 72 hr post-TBI, respectively. Further augmentation of prostaglandin signaling following 6.5 Gy TBI by administration of exogenous 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 (dmPGE2) enhanced the survival of functional HSPCs acutely after injury. At 24 hr post-TBI, the bone marrow of dmPGE2-treated animals contained significantly more LSK cells (p=0.0037, n=13 mice/group) and colony forming unit-spleen cells (p=0.037, n=5 mice/group). Competitive transplantation assays at 72 hr post-TBI demonstrated that bone marrow cells from irradiated dmPGE2-treated mice exhibited increased repopulating activity compared with cells from vehicle-treated mice. Taken together, these results indicate that dmPGE2 treatment post-TBI increases survival of functional HSPCs. Since PGE2 can inhibit apoptosis of HSPCs in nai\u0308ve mice, the effect of dmPGE2 post-TBI on apoptosis was also investigated. HSPCs isolated from mice 24 hr post-TBI demonstrated statistically significant down-regulation of several pro-apoptotic genes and up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes in dmPGE2-treated animals (3 separate experiments with n=4\u20138 mice/group in each), suggesting that dmPGE2 initiates an anti-apoptotic program in HSPCs following injury. Notably, there was no significant change in expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Survivin, which has previously been reported to increase in response to ex vivo dmPGE2 treatment of bone marrow cells (Hoggatt et. al., Blood, 2009), suggesting differential effects of dmPGE2 in vivo and/or in an injury setting. Additionally, to ensure that this inhibition of apoptosis was not merely increasing survival of damaged and non-functional HSPCs, the effect of early treatment with dmPGE2 post-TBI on hematopoietic recovery was assayed by monitoring peripheral blood counts. Interestingly, dmPGE2 treatment in the first 72 hr post-TBI significantly accelerated recovery of platelet levels and hematocrit compared with injured vehicle-treated mice (n=12 mice/group). Immunohistochemical analysis of the bone marrow of dmPGE2-treated mice also exhibited a dramatic activation of Cox-2 in the bone marrow microenvironment. This suggests that the beneficial effect of dmPGE2 treatment following injury may occur, both through direct stimulation of hematopoietic cells and also via activation of the HSC niche. In summary, these data indicate that PGE2 is a critical microenvironmental regulator of hematopoietic cells in response to injury. Exploitation of the dmPGE2-induced initiation of an anti-apoptotic program in HSPCs may represent a useful method to increase survival of these cells after sub-lethal radiation injury. Further, amplification of prostaglandin signaling by treatment with PGE2 agonists may also represent a novel approach to meaningfully accelerate recovery of peripheral blood counts in patients with hematopoietic system injury during a vulnerable time when few therapeutic options are currently available.
