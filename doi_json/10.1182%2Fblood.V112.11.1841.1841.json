    "abstract_text": "Protein Kinase C\u03b4 (PKC\u03b4), a novel PKC isoform is expressed and activated in platelets downstream of PARs and GPVI receptors. In the current study, the role of PKC\u03b4 in regulating platelet functional responses was investigated using a pharmacological inhibitor, (\u03b4V1-1)TAT (a PKC\u03b4 inhibitor) in human platelets. These studies were further confirmed by a knockout approach using PKC\u03b4 +/+ and PKC\u03b4 \u2212/\u2212 mice. In both human and murine platelets, PAR4-mediated dense granule secretions were inhibited, whereas GPVI-mediated dense granule secretions were potentiated. Furthermore, \u03b1-granule secretions and thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ) generation were differentially regulated in murine platelets.. These data suggest a differential role for this isoform in regulating dense granule secretion, \u03b1-granule secretion and TXA 2 generation. Previous studies have shown that PAR-mediated fibrinogen receptor activation is regulated by a Calcium-dependent and a PKC-dependent pathway. The contribution of PKC\u03b4 to PAR-mediated fibrinogen receptor activation was studied by pretreating human and murine platelets with BAPTA. Our results showed a inhibition of AYPGKF-induced aggregation in human and murine platelets in the presence of BAPTA and fibrinogen. These results suggest a small contribution of PKC\u03b4 to PAR-4- mediated platelet aggregation and a IIb b 3 activation. The in vivo significance of PKC\u03b4 was tested using a FeCl 3 injury model. While the wildtype mice occluded in 7 minutes, PKC\u03b4 \u2212/\u2212 mice occluded after 4 minutes of injury with 10 % FeCl 3 . Therefore, we conclude that PKC\u03b4 regulates platelet functional responses such as dense, \u03b1-granule secretions, TXA 2 generation downstream of both PARs and GPVI receptors, contributes to PAR-4-mediated fibrinogen receptor activation ex vivo and plays a critical role in the thrombus formation in vivo .
