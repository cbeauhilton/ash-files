    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3204 Poster Board III-141 Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited congenital bone marrow failure syndrome, characterized by red blood cell aplasia, macrocytic anemia, and increased risk of malignancy. Although anemia is the most prominent feature of DBA, the disease is also characterized by growth retardation and congenital malformations, which occur in about 40% of patients. Approximately 90% of patients present during the first year of life or in early childhood. Recent studies have shown that the disease is associated with heterozygous mutations in the ribosomal protein (RP) genes RPS19 , RPS24 , and RPS17 , encoding small ribosomal subunit proteins, and in RPL5 , RPL11 and RPL35a , encoding large ribosomal subunit proteins, in about 50% of patients with DBA in Western countries. There have been no studies to determine the incidence of these mutations in Asian patients with DBA. In this study, 44 probands (46 patients) with DBA in Japan were screened for mutations of the 6 known DBA genes RPS19 , RPS24 , RPS17, RPL5 , RPL11, and RPL35a , in addition to RPS14 , which is implicated in the 5q- syndrome, a subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by a defect in erythroid differentiation. Mutations in RPS19 , which have been found in 25% of patients in Western countries, were detected in 6 probands (13.6%). Missense mutations were noted in 5 of these probands, and a frameshift mutation caused by a single-nucleotide insertion was found in 1 case. Three of 7 patients had multiple malformations. Novel mutations in RPL5 were identified in 3 probands (6.8%). Insertion of 2 nucleotides was found in 1 case, affecting the reading frame. Two cases had point mutations, which resulted in a loss of the first initiation codon. All 3 patients with RPL5 mutations had multiple physical anomalies. Remarkably, 2 of 3 patients with RPL5 mutations had cleft palate, whereas no other DBA patients presented with cleft palate. Mutations in RPL11 were identified in 2 patients (4.5%). Deletion of 1 or 2 nucleotides was found in each case, leading to a shift in the reading frame. In contrast to previous reports on patients with RPL11 mutations, thumb anomalies were not seen. Deletion of 1 nucleotide in RPS17 was identified in 1 patient (2.3%), resulting in introduction of a premature stop codon. RPS17 mutations are rare and have been only reported in 2 patients with DBA. Anomalies were not seen in our patient. In summary, RP gene mutations were identified in 27.3% of DBA index cases in Japan. No mutations were detected in RPS14 , RPS24 and RPL35a . In Japan, the frequency of mutations in the RP genes appears to be lower than in Western countries. Mutations in RPL5 are associated with multiple physical abnormalities, including cleft palate.
