    "abstract_text": "The leukocyte NADPH oxidase generates superoxide, the precursor to reactive oxygen species important for host defense and immunoregulation. Genetic defects in NADPH oxidase result in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), characterized by serious bacterial and fungal infections and aberrant inflammation. Aspergillus pneumonia is frequent, and associated with pyogranulomatous inflammation. Of note, even sterile fungal cell walls elicit increased neutrophilic inflammation in CGD mice, demonstrating that that NADPH oxidase can limit inflammation independent of its antimicrobial effects. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent inflammatory mediator, acting as a chemoattractant and activating other polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) functions. PMN themselves are prominent source of LTB4, and sense LTB4 through its receptor BLT1, which stimulates additional LTB4 synthesis by autocrine and paracrine routes. This leads to feed forward amplification of LTB4 production locally and formation of PMN clusters. Ca 2+ acts as an important second messenger in PMN, including regulation of LTB4 synthesis. Activated human CGD PMN have increased intracellular Ca 2+ levels compared to PMN from healthy donors due to electrogenic effects of the NADPH oxidase (Geiszt M. et al JBC 1997). Intracellular Ca 2+ overload in PMN is speculated to contribute to increased PMN pro-inflammatory activity, but specific pathways and in vivo relevance are not well defined. Therefore, we therefore investigated the production of LTB4 by murine CGD PMN and the role of LTB4 in PMN recruitment and lung hyperinflammation following pulmonary challenge with zymosan, a sterile fungal cell wall preparation. Zymosan-stimulated PMN from Cybb -null mice, a model for X-linked CGD, produced higher LTB4 in vitro compared to wild type (WT), even in the presence of SOD and catalase to counteract oxidative degradation. Higher LTB4 production correlated with higher levels of intracellular Ca 2+ in stimulated X-CGD PMN. The increased LTB4 produced by X-CGD PMN was dependent on cell density and the LTB4 receptor BLT1, consistent with a feed-forward loop that amplified LTB4 production. Zymosan-stimulated X-CGD PMN also formed larger and more numerous clusters in vitro compared to WT PMN. Cluster formation was abrogated by inhibiting LTB4 synthesis with the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) inhibitor zileuton or by the BLT1 receptor antagonist U75302, demonstrating that cluster formation was LTB4 and BLT1 dependent. We next examined whether LTB4 regulated the response to zymosan in the lung. Following intranasal administration of zymosan, X-CGD mice had higher PMN numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), larger PMN foci by lung histology, and increased lung LTB4 as compared to WT mice. These differences were evident by 8 hr and progressed over the first 24 hr post-challenge, in contrast to WT mice where inflammation plateaued at 8 hr. Treatment with zileuton or U75302 just prior to zymosan significantly reduced lung PMN numbers for both WT and X-CGD mice at 8 hr post challenge, and lung PMN remained substantially reduced in X-CGD mice at 24 hrs. Moreover, delaying administration of zileuton to 8 hr after zymosan challenge also significantly decreased PMN inflammation in X-CGD but not WT mice at 24 hrs, indicating that ongoing synthesis of LTB4 otherwise continued to promote PMN recruitment in CGD mice. These results demonstrate that PMN production of LTB4 in response to fungal cell walls is limited by NADPH oxidase via its effects on intracellular Ca 2+ . In oxidase-deficient CGD mice, LTB4 plays a major role in driving excessive PMN recruitment to the lung in the early response to zymosan. This study is the first to implicate LTB4 in promoting neutrophilic lung inflammation in response to fungal cell walls in CGD, likely by an amplified feed-forward loop involving increased production of LTB4 by CGD PMN. LTB4 could be a potential therapeutic target to ameliorate CGD hyperinflammation. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
