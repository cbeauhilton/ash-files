    "abstract_text": "Previously, we demonstrated that activation of Notch receptors by culture of murine lin \u2212 Sca-1 + c-kit + (LSK) hematopoietic progenitors with the Notch ligand Delta1 ext\u2212IgG , consisting of the extracellular domain of Delta1 fused to the Fc domain of human IgG, promoted early T cell differentiation and increased the number of progenitors capable of short-term lymphoid and myeloid reconstitution. Here we show accelerated thymic engraftment and T cell recovery after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in recipients of LSK cells cultured with Delta1 ext\u2212IgG compared to recipients of non-cultured LSK cells. Furthermore, data suggest that accelerated T cell recovery resulted from progenitor cells induced towards T cell differentiation. 10 3 LSK cells cultured with Delta1 ext\u2212IgG generated an 10 8 -fold increase in total number of cells compared to cutlure with control IgG. Using limiting dilution analysis we estimated the number of progenitors with T cell potential in 10 3 LSK cells was 2.3; after culture with Delta1 ext\u2212IgG , the number in the 10 11 expanded product was 1.9\u00d710 9 , representing a 5\u00d710 8 -fold increase. Lethally irradiated mice received 10 5 BM cells along with 10 3 LSK cells or 10 6 Delta1 ext\u2212IgG -cultured cells. At 3 and 5 wks after HCT, blood samples from recipients of Delta1 ext\u2212IgG -cultured cells contained 9- and 3-fold higher numbers of CD3 + cells compared to recipients of LSK cells (p<0.04 and p<0.05). At 1 wk after HCT, thymuses from recipients of Delta1 ext\u2212IgG -cultured cells showed a 10-and 9-fold increase, respectively, in the percentage of donor CD4 + and CD8 + cells compared to recipients of LSK cells (p<0.007 and p<0.007). Cultured cells were sorted into fractions containing either Sca-1 + c-kit + cells or Sca-1 + c-kit + depleted cells. Both fractions had T cell potential but at 7 wks after HCT, the Sca-1 + c-kit + -enriched fraction maintained 3-fold higher numbers of CD3 + cells compared to the other fraction (p<0.04). These data suggest that the Sca-1 + c-kit + fraction had the potential for more sustained T cell production and contained a more immature precursor compared to the other subsets. Most of the Sca-1 + c-kit + cells (98%) expressed the lymphoid-associated antigens B220, IL7R\u03b1, CD25 and/or Thy1 (SK-lymph + ). The SK-lymph \u2212 cells were rare, representing 1 in 100 cells in culture. We transplanted proportionate numbers of each population into irradiated mice with 10 5 BM cells. Recipients of 10 6 sorted SK-lymph + cells had 20-fold higher numbers of CD3 + cells compared to recipients of 10 4 sorted SK-lymph \u2212 cells (p<0.002). Despite injecting 100-fold fewer cells, the SK-lymph \u2212 cells generated similar number of B and myeloid reconstitution as SK-lymph + cells. The SK-lymph + cells are potent T cell progenitors and serve as more committed progenitors that preferentially reconstitute T cells, since B and myeloid reconstitution was not enhanced. Although, both undifferentiated Sca-1 + c-kit + cells and cells differentiated toward the lymphoid lineage (SK-lymph + ) were able to reconstitute the T cell lineage, the SK-lymph \u2212 was more efficient on a per cell basis. However, the SK-lymph + population was responsible for the majority of the repopulation as it was the largest population generated following culture with Delta1 ext\u2212IgG . This report describes a novel and clinically feasible ex-vivo culture system using Delta1 for the generation of T cell progenitors as a means to accelerate initial T-cell recovery after HCT."
