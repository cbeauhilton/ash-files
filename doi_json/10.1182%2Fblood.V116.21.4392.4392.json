    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4392 Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm disorder and an independent risk factor for stroke. It\u2032s prevalence in AF pts without oral anticoagulation (OA) is 1 to 12%. OA is recommended in all valvular AF pts and in non valvular AF pts associated with other risk factors for stroke (CHADS 2 score >1). Objective: to evaluate characteristics, evolution and incidence of thrombosis and bleeding in pts with AF under OA for at least 3 months. Methods: we retrospectively analyzed 850 pts between Jan 2003 and Jan 2010. Results: the mean follow-up was 25 months (range 3\u2013169). The features of the entire group are listed in the table below:  Mean age (years, range) 71 (22\u201397) Age >74 years 384 (45.1%) Male gender 476 (56%) Valvular AF 413/624 (66%) Previous thrombosis 109 (12.8%) Diabetes 118 (13.9%) Arterial Hypertension 401 (47.1%) Dilated cardiomyopathy 209/587 (35.6%) Ejection fraction <30 137/655 (20.9%) Mega atrium 172/609 (28.2%) Hypertiroidism 157 (18.5%) Coronary disease 173 (20.4%) Admissions to hospital 57 (6.7%) Creatinin \u2265 2 63 (7.4%) Median INR 2.42 Controls between INR 2-3 59.5% Mean age (years, range) 71 (22\u201397) Age >74 years 384 (45.1%) Male gender 476 (56%) Valvular AF 413/624 (66%) Previous thrombosis 109 (12.8%) Diabetes 118 (13.9%) Arterial Hypertension 401 (47.1%) Dilated cardiomyopathy 209/587 (35.6%) Ejection fraction <30 137/655 (20.9%) Mega atrium 172/609 (28.2%) Hypertiroidism 157 (18.5%) Coronary disease 173 (20.4%) Admissions to hospital 57 (6.7%) Creatinin \u2265 2 63 (7.4%) Median INR 2.42 Controls between INR 2-3 59.5% View Large Minor bleeding was observed in 32.7% of the entire group (278/850) and major bleeding in 2.7% (23/850). Most of the major bleedings occurred at the gastrointestinal tract, and 53% of those pts presented INR <2 (8/15). Fatal bleeding (located at CNS) developed in 0.2% (2/850). Ten pts developed thrombosis during the follow-up period (1.17%); 50% of them with INR < 2. Conclusion: 45% of the pts were older than 74 years and most of them disclosed valvular AF. Minor bleeding was 15.4%/year, major bleeding: 1%/year, and thrombosis: 0.42%/year, according to the current literature. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
