    "abstract_text": "Background: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are hematological disorders characterized by chronic anemia, and are often refractory to cytokine therapy. Two phase 2 studies evaluating lenalidomide in MDS (MDS-001 and MDS-003), demonstrated a high frequency of erythroid response in patients with a chromosome 5q31 deletion ( List AF et al., N Eng J Med  2005 ; 352 : 549 \u2013557 and List AF et al., in press). Herein we report on the durability of response with long term follow-up approaching 4 years. Methods: All enrolled subjects were evaluated for frequency and duration of red blood cell transfusion independence (RBC-TI), change in hemoglobin (Hgb), pathologic and cytogenetic response, and safety. Results: Ten 5q31- patients achieved a cytogenetic and/or major erythroid response in MDS-001. Four of these patients have maintained a major response for at least 2 years (range 2.2 to 3.7 years). In MDS-003, 99 (67%) of 148 enrolled patients achieved RBC-TI. Of the 99 responders 83 were Low/Int-1, 3 were Int-2/High and 13 were not classified. Median increase in Hgb from baseline to maximum achieved during RBC-TI was 5.4 g/dL (range 1.1, 11.4). The estimated median duration of response was 115.9 weeks, and 52 (53%) of 99 responders remain on study with ongoing RBC-TI response as of 30 June 2006. Duration of response was at least 52 weeks for 63 (64%), 78 weeks for 52 (53%), and 104 weeks for 36 (36%) of 99 responding patients. Variables (or co-variates) associated with longer duration of TI in multivariate analysis included low baseline transfusion requirement (10% of patients (15/148; 10%). Adverse events were manageable through supportive treatment and dose reduction. Conclusion: Lenalidomide is an effective treatment in MDS patients with an associated chromosome 5q31 deletion, with RBC-TI and major erythroid response maintained for median duration > 2 years.",
