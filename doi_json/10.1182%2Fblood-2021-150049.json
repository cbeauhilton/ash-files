    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: APTO-253 represses expression of the MYC oncogene by targeting a conserved G-quadruplex structure in its promoter, down-regulates MYC mRNA and protein levels and induces apoptosis in AML cell lines and marrow samples from patients with AML, MDS, and MPN in vitro . After injection, a large fraction of APTO-253 binds iron and transforms to the Fe(253) 3 complex which retains full activity. APTO-253 has been granted orphan drug designation for AML by the US FDA and is being studied in a Phase 1a/b clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory AML (R/R AML) or high-risk myelodysplasias (high-risk MDS) (NCT02267863). AIMS: Primary objectives are to determine the safety and tolerability of APTO-253, MTD, dose limiting toxicities (DLT), and the RP2D. Key secondary objectives are to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, pharmacodynamic (PD) activity, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity. METHODS: Eligible patients have R/R AML or high-risk MDS for which either standard treatment has failed, is no longer effective, or can no longer be administered safely. Treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and tumor responses are evaluated using International Working Group criteria. APTO-253 is administered by IV infusion once weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle; ascending dose cohorts were enrolled at a starting dose of 20 mg/m 2 with planned escalation to 403 mg/m 2 . RESULTS: As of June 7, 2021, a total of 18 patients (median age 64.0 years, 16 AML and 2 high-risk MDS) with a median of 2.5 prior treatments (range of 1 - 9) have been treated with APTO-253 at doses of 20 (n=1), 40 (n=1), 66 (n=4), 100 (n=4) and 150 mg/m 2 (n=8). Most patients were RBC (87.5% of AML and 100% of MDS) and/or platelet (75% of AML and 50% MDS) transfusion-dependent. No DLTs or drug-related serious adverse events have been reported. Only 1 patient had a drug-related TEAE of grade 3 or greater (fatigue, Grade 3, probably related). Preliminary PK analysis (Figure 1) showed that serum levels of APTO-253 were dose proportional. C max and AUC 0-72h for C1D1 dosing were 0.06, 0.02, 0.36 \u00b1 0.37, 0.44 \u00b1 0.41 and 0.72 \u00b1 0.70 \u00b5M and 0.11, 0.15, 3.98 \u00b1 1.77, 4.79 \u00b1 0.87 and 2.51 \u00b1 1.73 \u00b5M*h for dose levels of 20, 40, 66, 100 and 150 mg/m 2 , respectively. Plasma levels for Fe(253) 3 were significantly higher than those for the APTO-253 monomer. For example, C max and AUC 0-72h of Fe(253) 3 for C1D1 dosing of patients in Cohort 150 mg/m 2 were 2- and 20- fold higher than the ATPO-253 monomer at 15.09 \u00b1 0.42 \u00b5M and 51.52 \u00b1 28.26 \u00b5M*h, respectively. Following dosing at 150 mg/m 2 , serum concentrations of Fe(253) 3 were above 0.5 \u00b5M for > 48 h, which approaches the therapeutic range based on in vitro studies. CONCLUSIONS: APTO-253 has been well-tolerated at doses of 20, 40, 66, 100 and 150 mg/m 2 over multiple cycles and escalated to 210 mg/m 2 (Cohort 6). PK analysis revealed that APTO-253 is rapidly transformed to and co-exists with the Fe(253) 3 in serum from R/R AML and high-risk MDS patients. Enrollment of patients at the 210 mg/m 2 dose level is ongoing and updated clinical data will be presented at the meeting.
