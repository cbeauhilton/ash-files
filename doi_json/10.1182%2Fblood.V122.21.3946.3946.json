    "abstract_text": "Somatic point mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 have a gain-of-function neomorphic activity that converts alpha-ketoglutarate to the oncometabolite, R (-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Prospective studies of AML patients carrying IDH mutations have shown that intracellular concentrations of 2HG can range from 3-10 mM. This abnormal level of 2HG results in dysregulation of alpha-ketoglutarate dependent enzymes leading to alterations in the epigenetic state of hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells and functionally blocks their ability to fully differentiate. We have developed a potent and selective, orally available IDH1 mutant inhibitor AGI-14100, that is able to reduce intracellular 2HG concentrations to baseline levels found in wildtype cells. Ex vivo treatment of IDH1 mutant-containing primary human AML patient samples with AGI-14100 induced a proliferative burst followed by cellular differentiation as shown by flow cytometry and cytology. We next treated a primary human IDH1 (R132H)/FLT3-ITD mutant xenograft model with AGI-14100 either alone or in combination with Ara-c. In these studies, AGI-14100 alone significantly decreased tumor burden in the peripheral blood after 1 month of continuous BID treatment. In combination with a short-term, low-dose course of Ara-C, we also observed a decrease in the bone marrow tumor burden that was better than either treatment alone. Furthermore, this response was sustainable for >3 weeks even after dosing of both drugs had been terminated. Taken together, these data suggest that inhibition of mutant IDH1with AGI-14100 and low dose Ara-c could provide a combination benefit for patients with AML.
