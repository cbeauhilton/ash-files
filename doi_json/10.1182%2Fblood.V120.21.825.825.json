    "abstract_text": "Abstract 825 Epigenetics has emerged as a key regulator of the fetal to adult hemoglobin switch during development. Understanding the mechanisms of fetal \ud835\udec4-globin gene silencing offers the promise of effective targeted therapy of \u03b2- thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. Previous studies carried out by our group using adult erythroid cells from mice transgenic for a yeast artificial chromosome containing the entire human \u03b2-globin locus (\u03b2-YAC) and primary human erythroid cells have shown that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MBD2) is critical for full silencing of the fetal \ud835\udec4-globin gene. MBD2 binds to methylated CpG rich promoters and silences the associated target genes by recruiting the Nuclear Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) co-repressor complex. Absent or \u226575% decreased expression of MBD2 has been shown to have a 10\u201350 fold stimulatory effect on the expression of the \ud835\udec4-globin gene in adult \u03b2-YAC transgenic mice and a 5\u20136 fold effect in CD34+ progenitor derived human erythroid cells in culture. Mi2, a major component of the NuRD complex, is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler consisting of two isoforms, Mi2a (also known as CHD3) and Mi2\u03b2 (also known as CHD4). We have observed that 80% knockdown of Mi2\u03b2 leads to a significantly higher expression of the \ud835\udec4-globin gene in \u03b2YAC containing murine adult hematopoietic CID cells (\u223c100 fold) when compared to equivalent knockdown of other components of the MBD2/NuRD complex (\u223c5-10 fold), including MBD2. Remarkably, in CD34+ progenitor derived adult human erythroid cells, as little as 40% knockdown of Mi2\u03b2 resulted in a \u223c30 fold increase in \ud835\udec4/\ud835\udec4 + \u03b2 mRNA levels. Moreover, simultaneous knockdown of MBD2 and Mi2\u03b2 resulted in no greater \ud835\udec4-globin gene expression than Mi2\u03b2 knockdown alone. This suggests that Mi2\u03b2 is acting independently of as well as through its role in the MBD2-NuRD complex to exert its silencing effect on the \ud835\udec4-globin gene. Complete conditional knockout of Mi2\u03b2 in transgenic mouse hematopoietic cells has been shown by others to result in arrest of erythroid differentiation. We observed that in human CD34+ progenitor cells \u226580% Mi2\u03b2 knockdown also altered differentiation. In contrast, 40\u201350% knockdown of Mi2\u03b2 does not affect erythroid differentiation compared to scramble shRNA controls and resulted in 25 \u2013 40% \ud835\udec4/\ud835\udec4 + \u03b2 globin RNA expression versus 2\u20133% in scramble shRNA controls. To determine possible mechanisms of Mi2\u03b2-mediated silencing outside of its role in the MBD2-NuRD complex, we examined the effect of Mi2\u03b2 knockdown on two key mediators of \ud835\udec4-globin gene silencing, Bcl11A and KLF-1 (EKLF). Our results showed that RNA and protein levels of these proteins are diminished by 40% and 70% respectively in cells with 40\u201350% Mi2\u03b2 knockdown. Knockdown of MBD2 caused no decrease in either Bcl11A or KLF-1 levels. Thus at least part of the effect of Mi2\u03b2 on \ud835\udec4-globin gene silencing is through its positive effects on KLF-1 and Bcl11A expression. In summary, we have shown that less than a 50% decrease in Mi2\u03b2 expression in primary human adult erythroid cells resulted in high levels of \ud835\udec4/\ud835\udec4 + \u03b2 gene expression without altering erythroid differentiation. The silencing effects of Mi2\u03b2 occur both through the MBD2-NuRD repressor complex and through positive regulation of the KLF-1 and Bcl11A genes. These results also suggest that partial inhibition of Mi2\u03b2 function could be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of \u03b2- thalassemia and sickle cell anemia.
