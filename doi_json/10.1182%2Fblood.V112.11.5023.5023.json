    "abstract_text": "B cell receptor (BCR) signaling plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In a subset of patients with a poor clinical outcome, BCR ligation leads to increased cell metabolism and cell survival ( Cancer Research  66 , 7158 \u201366, 2006 ). Based on these findings, we tested whether targeting BCR signaling with dasatinib, an inhibitor of Src kinase, would interfere with the signaling cascade and cause death of CLL B cells. CLL leukemic cells were isolated from 34 patients and were incubated with or without dasatinib at a low dose of 128 nM. Among 34 cases, viability of leukemic cells was reduced by 2% to 90%, with an average of ~50% reduction on day 4 of ex vivo culture. Further study showed that CLL B cells undergo death by apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway which involves the generation of reactive oxygen species. Analysis of the Src family kinases showed that phosphorylation of Src, Lyn and Hck was inhibited by dasatinib not only in those cases that responded to dasatinib with apoptosis, but also in those that did not respond well (<20% apoptosis). Further analysis revealed that suppressed activity of two downstream molecules, Syk and PLC Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation between CLL dasatinib response and their IgV H mutation and ZAP70 status. Cases with worse prognoses by these criteria have a better response to the kinase inhibitor. Lastly, we have also found that ZAP70 positive cases showed a greater degree of PLC"
