    "abstract_text": "Additional copies of chromosome (chr) 21 are the most common chromosomal aneuploidy in childhood leukemia. Patients with DS have a markedly increased risk for both AML and ALL. Thus trisomy 21 is leukemogenic. DS-AML is uniquely characterized by an acquired mutation in the chr X gene GATA1. The existence of a similar unique collaborating mutation in DS-ALL has been postulated but remained elusive. To identify such mutations, we performed a large mutational screen in 81 diagnostic samples of B cell precursor DS-ALL, stored in central labs of 9 European childhood ALL protocols (representing more than 8000 samples of childhood ALL). Mutations in JAK2 were identified in 16 (19.7%) DS-ALL patients. The mutations are different from those observed in myeloproliferative disorders. In fifteen patients a point mutation resulted in substitution of the conserved Arginine at position 683. In one patient an in-frame insertion caused displacement of the same amino-acid. The mutations cause constitutive activation of JAK2 and are predicted to disrupt a critical interaction between the pseudokinase and the SH2 domains. The mutations are acquired as they do not exist in remission samples. The mutated RNA is expressed. They are unique to DS-ALL as screening of over 300 non DS-ALL, as well as DS-AMKL, has revealed only one instance with a similar mutation. Strikingly, that patient had an ALL with an iso21q abnormality! The clinical presentation and survival data of DS-ALL patients with and without JAK2 mutation is currently analyzed and will be presented in the meeting. Our data demonstrate that novel mutations of JAK2 cooperate with trisomy 21 in at least 20% of ALLs in Down Syndrome. Thus it seems that, like DS-AML, at least 20% of DS-ALLs are different from sporadic childhood leukemias and characterized by unique acquired mutations in genes located outside chr 21 (GATA1 on the chr X and JAK2 on chr 9). Beyond the obvious therapeutic implications, these observations raise the hypothesis that JAK2 is important in B cell development and that constitutive activation of JAK2 in B cell precursors provides a survival advantage in the presence of a germline trisomy 21.",
