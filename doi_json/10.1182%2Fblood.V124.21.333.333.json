    "abstract_text": "The hemoglobinopathies, such as \u03b2-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia (SCA), are characterized by mutations of the \u03b2-globin gene resulting in either decreased or functionally abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) production. As bone marrow transplant is the only curative option for these patients, there is a strong need for new therapeutic approaches. Both \u03b2-thalassemia and SCA represent ideal targets for gene therapy since introduction of a normal \u03b2-globin gene can ameliorate the phenotype, as we and others have shown previously. Overcoming the developmental silencing of the fetal \u03b3-globin gene represents an additional approach for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies. Here, we directly compare a recently established approach to activate the \u03b3-globin gene using forced chromatin looping with pharmacologic approaches to raise \u03b3-globin expression. The \u03b2-type globin genes are activated through dynamic interactions with a distal upstream enhancer, the locus control region (LCR). The LCR physically contacts the developmental stage appropriate globin gene via chromatin looping, a process partially dependent on the protein Ldb1. Previously, we have shown that tethering Ldb1 to the murine \u03b2-globin promoter with a custom designed zinc finger protein (ZF-Ldb1) can induce loop formation and \u03b2-globin transcription in an erythroid cell line (Deng et al., 2012). Further work showed that forced chromatin looping can be exploited to potently reactivate fetal globin gene expression in adult human erythroid cells (Deng et al., 2014). Here we compared the efficacy and toxicity of ZF-Ldb1 to pharmacologic compounds that induce HbF in cultured hematopoietic stem progenitor cell-derived erythroid cultures from normal and SCA donors. ZF-Ldb1 increased HbF synthesis in SCA erythroid cells (N=8) up to 86% and, concurrently, reduced sickle Hb (HbS) below 15%, consistent with previous studies of erythroid cells from normal probands. Preliminary results obtained from treating SCA specimens (N=3) show that the induction of HbF in cells treated with ZF-Ldb1 is twice as high (+35.55% \u00b1 8.34%, at a dose of ~ one ZF-Ldb1 transgene copy per cell) as that observed using pomalidomide (+16.50% \u00b1 14.57%, 20\u03bcM) and decitabine (+15.60% \u00b1 12.36%, 0.5\u03bcM). Tranylcypromine and hydroxyurea showed the lowest HbF increase (+9.67% \u00b1 3.26% and +5.06 \u00b1 2.82%, 1.5\u03bcM and 150\u03bcM respectively). Importantly, decitabine and pomalidomide treatment lowered cell viability to 39% and 26%, respectively, while ZF-Ldb1 expressing cells retained normal viability similar to control populations. In related experiments, we are comparing the expression of a battery of genes known to regulate HbF levels (BCL11A, SOX6, KLF1 and C-Myb) in normal and SCA derived erythroid cells treated with ZF-Ldb1 or HbF inducers and compared to controls. Preliminary analyses indicate altered expression of KLF1 in SCA versus normal cells, consistent with a superior response of SCA cells to HbF induction. In conclusion, lentiviral-mediated ZF-Ldb1 gene transfer appears superior to pharmacologic compounds in terms of efficacy and cell viability further supporting suitability for the reactivation of HbF in SCA erythroid cells.
