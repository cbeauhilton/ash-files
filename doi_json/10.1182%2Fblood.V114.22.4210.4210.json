    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4210 To detect the gene mutation of a pedigree with coagulation factor XII (FXII) deficiency. Methods The peripheral blood samples were collected from the proband and his parents, and the plasma FXII:C were determined. All the exons and exon-intron boundries of F12 gene were amplified with PCR and sequenced directly. Results The activity of FXII were 52.5%, 78.6% and 89% for the proband, his father and mother, respectively. Direct sequencing suggested that the proband was 46 T/T genotype in exon1, while both his parents were 46 C/T genotype in the same alle. No other base change was detected in F12 gene. Conclusion The 46 T/T polymorphism of F12 gene might be the cause of FXII:C deficiency for the propositus. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
