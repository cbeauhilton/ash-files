    "abstract_text": "We postulated that it is possible to safely extend the benefits of allografting to metastatic breast cancer by combining cytoreduction achieved with high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant (HDT/ASCT) and graft versus tumor effect mediated through transplanted donor immune cells with nonmyeloablative allografting (RICT). Seventeen patients, 41 years of age (range, 31\u201357), with heavily pretreated disease were given HDT/ASCT. No patient died after HDT/ASCT. Thirty-one to 92 days (median, 51 days) after HDT/ASCT the patients received fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 /day x 3 days and cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 /day x 3 days and donor PBPC from HLA-identical siblings. Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate. Donor lymphocyte infusions were given to 11 patients with stable mixed chimerism and/or progressive disease, who did not show signs of GVHD. Thirteen patients (76%) achieved sustained donor engraftment. Three patients achieved partial remission (PR) after HDT/ASCT and complete remission (CR) after RICT; another no-responsive patient achieved PR for an overall response rate of 4/17 (22%). The first signs of responsiveness in CR patients began at day +80, +90 and +110 and the maximal response was achieved on day +240, +300 and +390. The 3 remitters patients achieved full chimerism and developed GVHD before regression of the disease. Grade \u2265II aGVHD occurred in 5 patients (29%) and extensive cGVHD in 5 patients (29%). No transplant-related deaths (TRD) were observed during the first 100 days. Three patients died of extensive cGVHD in the first year. At April 2004, 5/17 patients (29%) are alive 90\u20132160 days (median, 1320) from RICT. In conclusion, this 2-step approach is a feasible procedure in metastatic breast cancer patients; the exploitation of graft versus tumor effect is a promising finding.",
