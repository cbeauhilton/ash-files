    "abstract_text": "[Background] Mixed lineage leukemia ( MLL also called KMT2A ) rearrangement-positive leukemia is one of the most aggressive types of leukemia. It is diagnosed predominantly in infants and typically shows a multi-lineage phenotype. Since current chemotherapy fails in more than 50% of infantile acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with MLL -rearrangement, a better understanding of biological features of the disease is important in order to develop more specific and successful treatment strategies. Despite the evident biological and clinical significance of MLL -rearrangement, it has also been shown in vitro and in vivo that MLL -rearrangement is not sufficient to induce full leukemic transformation, indicating additional hits are required for complete leukemogenesis. Recently, sequencing-based genome-wide studies have suggested collaborative involvement of RAS-PI3K pathway in infant leukemogenesis through identification of recurrent mutations affecting RAS-PI3K pathway genes, in infant ALL with or without MLL -rearrangement. However, genetic basis of infant ALL with MLL -rearrangement are not fully elucidated. [Materials and Methods] Here, we performed whole exome sequencing in leukemia samples with matched peripheral blood T lymphocyte from 46 cases of infant ALL including 3 cases with germline MLL . Our cohort included samples from the Infant Leukemia Sub-committee, Japan Children's Cancer Group. For mapping and mutation calling, we used publicly available \"Genomon Pipeline\". [Results] In total, 198 somatic non-silent mutations (4.3 mutations per case) were identified, including 125 missense, 4 nonsense, 8 splice site mutations, 49 frameshift indels, and 12 in-frame indels. Thirteen genes were recurrently affected, among which RAS-PI3K pathway mutations were the most frequent: KRAS (10/46 cases, 21.7%), NRAS (4/46 cases, 8.7%) and PTPN11 (3/46 cases, 6.5%). In addition, novel recurrent mutations were detected in HSP90AB1 (5/46 cases, 10.9%), MAPRE3 (2/46 cases, 4.3%) and SRCAP (2/46 cases, 4.3%), as well as known candidate driver mutations in FLT3 (7/46 cases, 15.2%), TP53 (3/46 cases, 6.5%), CHD4 (2/46 cases, 4.3%) and PAX5 (2/46 cases, 4.3%). HSP90AB1 is a member of Heat shock protein90 (Hsp90) family that encodes a group of molecular chaperones involved in stabilization and activation of multiple oncogenic proteins and pathways. Overexpression of Hsp90 is observed in ALL, chronic myeloid/lymphocytic leukemia and several non-hematological malignancies. Another recurrently mutated gene, SRCAP , encodes the core component of chromatin-remodeling Snf2-related CREBBP activator protein complex. Recurrent mutations in this gene have recently been reported in FLT3 -ITD positive acute myeloid leukemia with significantly high co-occurrence of MLL3 mutations. Overall, RAS-PI3K pathway mutations were detected in 19/46 cases of infant ALL (41.3%). In our cohort, none of 3 germline MLL cases contained RAS-PI3K pathway mutations; one case had a PAX5 mutation, another had a SRCAP mutation, and the other had no candidate driver mutations. In the germline MLL case without candidate drivers, G-banding had identified a structural abnormality, t(5;15)(p15;q11.2), that is rare but reported to be predominant in infant ALL rather than other hematological/non-hematological malignancies. [Conclusion] Our results demonstrated that aberrations of cell proliferation signaling, transcription factors, as well as cell cycle/epigenetic regulators are co-operative oncogenic events in MLL -rearrangement cases. The mutation spectrum is similar to myeloid malignancies rather than lymphoid cancers. Intriguingly, we identified novel recurrent mutations in the oncogenic proteins, such as HSP90AB1, MAPRE3, and SRCAP,suggesting that these are potentially targetable by small-molecule therapy. In addition, we also illustrated the genetic differences between MLL -rearrangement and germline MLL . Thus, our mutational landscape provides a novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of infant ALL and may contribute to improving the clinical outcome of infant patients suffering from the intractable ALL.
