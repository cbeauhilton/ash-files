    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3760 Lentiviral vectors (LV) assure stable transgene expression in vivo, allowing to investigate genes and their functions. In recent years, lentiviral gene transfer was considered to facilitate the generation of transgenic mice with a higher yield of transgenic offspring as compared to commonly used DNA microinjection. We applied LV to generate a mouse model transgenic for SETBP1 and eGFP. Murine zygotes were infected at dE0.5 with lentiviral particles directly injected into the perivitelline space. Specific PCRs for either the SETBP1 transgene or for the WPRE element of the lentiviral construct verified complete lentiviral integration in newborn pups (F0). Lentiviral integration sites were detected using highly sensitive LAM-PCR in 65% of 31 analyzed F0 mice. Germline transmission was shown in a total of 33% vector positive offspring from 5 out of 9 F0 mice. However, no ectopic transcription and overexpression of neither SETBP1 nor eGFP could be detected in transgenic mice. We therefore analyzed the methylation status of the internal SFFV promoter (SFFVp) by bisulfite sequencing. Extensive methylation (around 90%) could be assessed in 18 of 18 analyzed CpGs within the promoter region in F0 animals and in all progeny determined (n=12). We transduced mES cells with LV.SFFV.Setbp1.IRES.eGFP or the corresponding eGFP-expressing control vector to exclude transgene effects on epigenetic silencing of SFFVp sequences in self-inactivating LVs. Differentiation of ES cells infected with the transgene vector and SFFV driven control vector led to a 1.8 \u2013 3.5 fold decrease of eGFP expression. To analyze whether methylation of SFFVp sequences is a common event even in adult tissues, we analyzed the methylation status of peripheral blood in mice transplanted with bone marrow cells transduced with either gammaretroviral vectors (RV) or LV 3 months after transplantation (n=7). Interestingly, SFFVp sequences in peripheral blood of mice transplanted with LV transduced bone marrow were stronger methylated than CpGs of SFFVp in RV transplants. Our data demonstrate that the commonly used SFFV promotor is highly methylated with remarkable strength and frequency during development in vivo and differentiation in vitro . We conclude that lentiviral vectors using an internal SFFV promoter are not suitable for the generation of transgenic mice or constitutive expression studies in hematopoietic cells.
