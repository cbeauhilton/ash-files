    "abstract_text": "Since the adoption of rituximab as a mainstay of therapy in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, there has been growing debate on the importance of adriamycin and vincristine as treatment components used in the therapy of indolent non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, including Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia (WM). We therefore examined the outcome of symptomatic WM patients who required therapy based on consensus guidelines and received treatment at our Institution with CP-R (n=20), CVP-R (n=17), or CHOP-R (n=23). Baseline characteristics for all 3 cohorts were as follows:  . Median Age . Median Prior Therapies . Bone Marrow Involvement . sIgM (mg/dL) . Hct . PLT . B2M . CP-R 65 (range 42\u201374) 0 (range 0\u20132) 45% (range 5\u201395%) 2620 (range 551\u20136750) 33.4 270 2.3 CVP-R 60 (range 32\u201381) 1 (range 0\u20132) 50% (range 20\u201390%) 2220 (range 185\u20138430) 30.0 169 3.3 CHOP-R 54 (range 42\u201372) 0 (range 0\u20132) 50% (range 5\u201390%) 5150 (range 241\u201312400) 31.0 239 3.6 .

Importantly, significantly more toxicity was observed, particularly neutropenic fever and treatment related neuropathy among patients treated with CVP-R and CHOP-R versus CP-R. The results of this study suggest that in WM, the use of CPR may provide analogous treatment responses to more intense cyclophosphamide based regimens, while minimizing treatment related complications.",
