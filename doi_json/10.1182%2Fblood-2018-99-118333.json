    "abstract_text": "The targeted therapy ibrutinib inhibits B cell receptor signaling (BTK inhibitor) and has yielded high response rates and durable remissions in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, it is widely believed that the addition of immune therapies to targeted drugs will be required to activate anti-tumor immunity and work towards curative therapy. Identifying effective combinations of targeted drugs and/or standard chemotherapy with immunotherapy is a priority research area and particularly relevant for CLL, as patients' T cells have been shown to exhibit profound tolerance/exhaustion and notably, no activity was reported in a recent trial of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for relapsed disease. Ibrutinib has shown beneficial immunomodulatory activity in CLL by inhibiting IL-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK) as well BTK that is associated with increased effector CD4 + and CD8 + T cell numbers and decreased expression of inhibitory checkpoint receptors such as PD-1 on patient T cells. Here we have performed comparative immune bioassays from a randomized phase III trial comparing ibrutinib-based therapy to traditional FCR chemoimmunotherapy to assess the effects of treatments on anti-tumor T cell function. Viable peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples were collected serially (baseline, 6 months and 12 months) from CLL patients on the randomized phase III E1912 trial of ibrutinib and rituximab versus FCR for previously untreated disease to allow longitudinal batched immune analysis. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that highly purified CD3 + T cells from the FCR treated patients at 6 and 12-month time-points did not change their activated killing function against autologous baseline CD19 + CLL tumor B cells (acting as target antigen-presenting cells pulsed with superantigen, sAg) compared to pre-treatment/baseline exhausted T cells (n=22). In contrast, patients treated with ibrutinib-based therapy had a significant increase in activated anti-tumor T cell killing function ( P <.01, n=22) at both 6-month (66% increase) and 12-month (89% increase) time-points. Flow cytometric analysis of circulating immune subsets revealed that the percentage of PD-1 and PD-L1 positive cells among CD8 + and CD4 + T cells (particularly effector compartments) were reduced with ibrutinib-based therapy, whereas only a partial reduction was detected following FCR treatment. However, patients' T cells from both treatment arms responded normally to T cell receptor engagement by upregulating these checkpoint molecules. This led us to explore ex vivo treatment of highly purified CD3 + T cells and CD19 + CLL B cells from both treatment arms with anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 immunotherapy prior to cytotoxicity assays. Our functional data revealed that the T cells from both FCR time-points (6 and 12-months) were not sensitive to either anti-PD-L1 (n=14) or anti-PD-1 (n=14) treatment. In contrast, ibrutinib-based treatment sensitized anti-tumor T function (23% increase in killing) following anti-PD-L1 treatment (n=14) at the 6-month time-point only ( P <.01) but not with anti-PD-1. To investigate the mechanism underlying these effector function differences, we compared the ability of highly purified CD3 + T cells from each treatment arm (n=45) time-point to form F-actin immunological synapses with baseline autologous CLL tumor B cells. Quantitative confocal image analysis revealed that ibrutinib-based therapy significantly ( P <.01) enhanced polarization of F-actin, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and granzyme B at immune synapses with tumor cells at both 6 and 12-month time-points, whereas FCR treated patient T cells failed to mobilize these lytic synapse molecules. Importantly, our assays have revealed that T cells from both FCR treatment time-points formed \"non-polarized\" immune synapses with tumor cells, in keeping with cytotoxic dysfunction and insensitivity to additional checkpoint immunotherapy. In contrast, our functional correlative bioassays have revealed that ibrutinib-based therapy can reactivate exhausted cytolytic T cell function and suggest to us, a potential therapeutic window for anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy at the earlier 6-month time-point. We believe this data supports the concept of incorporating functional bioassays to immune-monitoring assays associated to clinical trials that should aid knowledge-led design of future combination immunotherapy.
