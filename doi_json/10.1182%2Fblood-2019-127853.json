    "abstract_text": "Introduction: BCR-ABL1 play a key role in the development of chronic myelogenous leukemia and a part of Ph1 positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). BCR-ABL1 functions as a tyrosine kinase. Whereas, BCR-ABL1 induces genomic instability by downregulation of BRCA1. An innate error of BRCA1, a molecule involved in the homologous recombination repair pathway, causes hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. PARP inhibitor (PARPi) induces synthetic lethality in BRCA defective cell. Therefore, PARP inhibitor is expected to induce efficient cell death with BCR-ABL1 positive cell. In addition, in some previous reports, reduction of PARP1 activity leads to the upregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway and BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase activates PI3K/AKT pathway. These findings suggest activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway leading to PARPi resistance in BCR-ABL1 positive leukemic cells. Here, we demonstrate that PARP inhibition attenuates BCR-ABL1 mediated leukemogenesis and aberration of factors associated with PARP inhibitor resistance induces cell death to fully transformed leukemic cells. Method: Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (MNC) from wild type mice and BCR-ABL1 transgenic (Tg) mice were exposed to PARPi in vivo, and cell death was analyzed Annexin-V positivity. PARPi sensitivity to BCR-ABL1 expressed cell was also investigated in vivo bone marrow transplantation model using mouse hematopoietic stem cell (HCS) infected with BCR-ABL1 expressing retrovirus. To evaluate more precisely the results obtained in vitro and in vivo transplantation model, the genetical approach was also performed. The Parp1 knockout (KO) mice were crossed with BCR-ABL1 Tg mice. Then, Leukemia development and subsequent mouse death were observed. In vitro, HR activity was examined using DR-GFP assay. Genomic instability was investigated using the breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) generation.Maintenance of HSC as a progenitor of the leukemic cell was analyzed by repopulation activity using colony assay. The growth-inhibitory effect was assessed using BCR-ABL positive cell lines with PARPi and PI3K inhibitor. Results: BCR-ABL1 Tg mice derived MNC showed more hypersensitivity to PARPi. Mouse HCS was infected with BCR-ABL1 expressing retrovirus and transplanted lethally Olaparib or vehicle was administrated intraperitoneal injection one day after transplantation. BCR-ABL1 mediated leukemic death was observed 1 month after transplantation in sham-treated mouse, whereas, Olaparib treated mouse did not develop BCR-ABL1 mediated leukemia. Parp1 KO BCR-ABL1 Tg mice attenuated leukemia development and extended their survival compared with BCR-ABL1 Tg mice. In vitro experiment revealed HR activity was down-regulated by BCR-ABL1 expression in DR-GFP assay. The number of BFB generation was increased in BCR-ABL1 Tg with Parp1 KO background. The colony-forming activity of BCR-ABL1 positive HSC was totally abolished by PARP inhibition after 3 times serial replating, whereas sham-treated HSC retained repopulation activity. However, the effect of PARPi on BCR-ABL positive leukemic cell lines was controversial. Therefore, leukemic cell lines were treated with the PARPi and inhibitors toward the molecules associated with PARPi resistance. As a result, a combination of PARPi with PI3K inhibitor effectively induce cell death in PARPi resistant BCR-ABL1 positive leukemic cell lines. Conclusion and discussion: Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is the gold standard of the therapeutic option of BCR-ABL1 positive leukemia. However, TKI monotherapy is not sufficient for complete eradication of leukemic cells. It is highly expected that molecules effectively induce cell death to leukemic cells combined with TKI. PARPi would be one of these candidates. However, PARPi could not induces efficient death in all of the cancer cells that carry the mutation of molecules associated with the HR defect. Comprehensive genetic analysis to reveal PARPi resistance is important for HRR defective cancer cells. Combination therapy of PARPi and inhibitorstoward the molecules associated with PARPi resistance would be a good therapeutic option for Ph1 positive leukemia.
