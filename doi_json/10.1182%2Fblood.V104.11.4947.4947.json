    "abstract_text": "Objective Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a very important cell system in bone marrow stromal and human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the most common complications following stem cells transplantation. Our studies were to investigate the CMV infection of MSCs as well as the apoptosis induction effects. Methods MSCs were infected by 100,10,1 TCID 50 of CMV. After 48h of culture with DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, MSCs shapes were observed. CMV particles and ultra structure in the cells were detected with transmission electron microscope. RT-PCR assay was used to detect the mRNA expression of CMV immediate early (IE) gene and GAPDH gene. Flow Cytometry was used to detect the apoptotic cells. Results After the infection of CMV, shape of MSCs changed, turning from thin shuttle shape to round and thick ball shape, even escaping from wall. Cell shape changed more dominantly as the CMV titer increased. With transmission electron microscope, CMV particles and typical cellular apoptotic character could be seen in the cells. MSCs infected by CMV could express IE mRNA compare with the uninfected and there were more apoptotic and necrosis cells in the cells infected by CMV. Conclusion CMV can not only infect MSCs and activate in the cells but also can induce apoptosis of the cells.",
