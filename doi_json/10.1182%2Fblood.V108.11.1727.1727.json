    "abstract_text": "Cytosine-guanine (CpG) motifs containing oligonucleotides (ODN) are commonly used for immunomodulatory purpose in cancer therapy and for the treatment of allergic diseases since they resemble bacterial DNA and serve as \u201cdanger signals\u201d. These CpG-ODNs promote predominately a T H 1-response with secretion of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3, In addition their broad potential includes activation of B-cell proliferation, monocyte stimulation and secretion of IgM and IL-6, and stimulation of plasmacytoid DC to produce IFN-\u03b1/-\u03b2 and thus \u03b3\u03b4T-cells and NK-cells to express CD69 and secrete IFN-\u03b3. Usually phosphorothioate (PS) modifications are to enhance the stability, but these are leading to several side-effects, like severe organ enlargements, morphological changes and immunosuppression in mice. We designed immunomodulatory molecules based on short covalently-closed dumbbell-like structures (dSLIM) to stabilize the DNA without the otherwise necessary PS-modification. To evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the dSLIM molecules we developed an in vitro anti-tumor assay. This assay uses supernatant from dSLIM-activated human PBMCs for incubation with tumor cells in vitro . We observed increased apoptosis and necrosis of the HT-29 tumor cell line after incubation with supernatant from dSLIM-treated PBMC which was significantly higher than the effect of supernatant from non-treated PBMC. In addition, supernatant from dSLIM-treated PBMC increased the expression of HLA-ABC on the tumor cells, a pre-requisite for tumor cell recognition by the immune system. These effects were confirmed with human HEK293 and murine Renca cell lines. Analyzing the effect with neutralizing antibodies to various apoptosis-related cytokines, we observed a crucial role of IFN-\u03b3 but not IFN-\u03b1 or TNF\u03b1. To investigate the anti-tumor effects of dSLIM in vivo , we employed a SKH1 murine model which is prone to spontaneous development of papillomas. Using chemicals for initiation and weekly promotion of de novo papilloma development we compared groups of weekly s.c. or i.p. dSLIM injections, respectively, with the PBS control group. The number of papilloma developing mice was significantly lower in the dSLIM groups and the total number of papillomas on all mice was reduced by approximately 50%. In conclusion, we showed that dSLIM immunomodulators exhibit potent anti-tumor effects in vitro and in vivo .",
