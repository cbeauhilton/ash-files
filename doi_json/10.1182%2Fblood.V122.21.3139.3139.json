    "abstract_text": "Background CRBN, a target of thalidomide and IMiDs \u00ae immunomodulatory agents lenalidomide (LEN) and pomalidomide (POM), is a component of the E3 ubiquitin cullin 4 ring ligase (CRL4) complex that also includes DDB1, Roc1, and Cul4. Two CRBN mutations have been reported in multiple myeloma (MM) patients: truncating mutation (Q99) and point mutation (R283K). One copy of the CRBN gene was shown to be deleted in the MM1S and MM1S.R cell lines. No DDB1 mutation has been described previously. Results We investigated the incidence of CRBN and DDB1 mutations by next-generation sequencing in 20 MM cell lines and MM subjects. Of 90 MM patients, 24 were newly diagnosed and 66 were relapsed and refractory of which 36 patients were LEN resistant. Out of the cell lines tested, 1 heterozygous CRBN mutation (D249Y) was found in the LEN-resistant ANBL6R cells, which is located in the putative DDB1 binding domain, and 2 single silent mutations were identified in the KMS-12-BM (rs17027638) and OPM-2 cells. One DDB1 heterozygous mutation (E303D) was identified in ANBL6 cells. In the cohort of patients assessed, no CRBN mutation was detected; however, 5 single nucleotide variations (SNV) were identified. Three of the 5 SNVs were at position 735 (Y245Y) and 1 each at position 219 (H73H) and 939 (C313C), respectively. The first 2 SNVs (rs17027638 and rs1045309) are described but not the last. We found a single SNV (P51P; rs2230356) in DDB1 gene the patient samples. Conclusion Mutations within the coding sequences of CRBN and DDB1 are rare in MM patients and cell lines. Most intrinsically LEN-resistant cells and cell lines made resistant to LEN or POM do not have CRBN or DDB1 mutations, suggesting the potential role of other sources, such as genetic or epigenetic pathways in developing resistance to IMiD drug\u2013based therapy.
