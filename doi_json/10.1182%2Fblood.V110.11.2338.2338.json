    "abstract_text": "GA101 is a novel humanized and glycoengineered CD20 antibody that was derived by humanization of the parental B-Ly1 mouse antibody and subsequent glycoengineering leading to the following characteristics: high affinity binding to the CD20 type II epitope; low complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity; high direct cell death induction; and high antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) potency. In vivo studies examined the consequences of GA101 on the growth of aggressive NHL xenograft models in SCID beige mice and the subsequent effects on survival. These studies demonstrated an outstanding dose-dependent anti-tumor activity of GA101. In particular, GA101 mediated superior anti-tumor efficacy in staged s.c. Z138 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and SU-DHL4 diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) xenograft models in direct comparison to rituximab. Weekly dosing of GA101 at 10 mg/kg (Z138 model) or 30 mg/kg (SU-DHL4) was able to induce complete tumor remission and long-term survival (cures) in all animals. Consistent anti-tumor efficacy against established tumors was also observed in a number of additional NHL models including Raji Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma or OCI-LY18 DLBCL models. In addition GA101 was evaluated in an orthotopic disseminated Z138 model. After i.v. injection of Z138 cells SCID beige mice developed large intraperitoneal lymphoid tumors in the ovary. Several experiments showed that GA101 mediated increased overall and median survival in this model in direct comparison to rituximab. All xenograft studies were performed in SCID beige mice that are incompetent for NK-mediated ADCC. Indeed, control experiments with non-glycoengineered GA101 in s.c. xenograft models suggest that the superiority of GA101 does not depend on enhanced interactions of the engineered Fc region with murine effector cells such as macrophages/monocytes or granulocytes. Thus, the anti-tumor effects of GA101 in s.c. xenograft models can be primarily attributed to non-effector cell mediated activities. Currently, experiments are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of GA101 in combination with classical chemotherapy regimens and novel targeted agents. First results from these studies will be presented during the 2007 ASH Annual Meeting. In summary it can be assumed that the combination of the recognition of a type II epitope together with improved ADCC potency might translate into superior efficacy in the clinical treatment of CD20 positive malignant diseases."
