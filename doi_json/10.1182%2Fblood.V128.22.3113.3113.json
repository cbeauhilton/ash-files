    "abstract_text": "Background Increased serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) typically accompany primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and might be linked to increased cell turnover from clonal myeloproliferation, including leukocytosis, low grade hemolysis and extra-medullary hematopoiesis in the liver. Despite the fact that serum LDH has been extensively utilized as a prognostic marker in both lymphoid neoplasms and solid tumors, there are limited studies in PMF that have systematically examined the clinical significance of the degree of serum LDH elevation in PMF. Methods Study patients fulfilled the 2016 WHO criteria for the diagnosis of PMF, including both pre-PMF and overt PMF ( Blood. 2016;127:2391 ). Additional selection criteria included the availability of serum LDH at time of referral. Marked elevation of serum LDH was defined as a value of \u22651000 U/L (i.e. over 4-fold increase from the upper limit of the normal range for our institution, which was 122-222 U/L), based on preliminary analysis of the threshold for prognostic effect. Targeted next generation sequencing was used to screen for prognostically-relevant mutations ( Blood 2015 126:354 ). Statistical analyses considered clinical and laboratory parameters obtained at time of initial referral to the Mayo Clinic. Results LDH values in overt PMF versus pre-PMF: The entire study population consisted of 357 patients, including 311 with overt PMF and 46 with pre-PMF. The median serum LDH level was 514 U/L (range 136-2263): overt PMF 532 U/L (range 136-2263); pre-PMF 401 U/L (range 180-1237) (p=0.0003). Accordingly, in order to avoid the confounding effect of the difference in serum LDH level between overt PMF and pre-PMF, and considering the small number of patients with pre-PMF, further analysis was limited to the 311 patients with overt PMF. Patient characteristics: The 311 patients (median age 64 years; 66% males) with overt PMF included 205 (66%) JAK2 , 49 (16%) type 1/like CALR , 13 (4%) type 2/like CALR , 16 (5%) MPL mutated cases and 28 (9%) were \"triple-negative\". DIPSS-plus risk distribution was 31% high, 43% intermediate-2, 15% intermediate-1 and 12% low; 30% displayed red cell transfusion-dependency and 37% abnormal karyotype, including 14% with unfavorable karyotype. 184 patients were screened for ASXL1 mutations with 42% mutated and 205 for SRSF2 mutations with 16% mutated. Clinical correlates of markedly elevated LDH (\u22651000 U/L): Among all 311 study patients with overt PMF, 37 (12%) displayed marked elevation of LDH (\u22651000/L). Patients with marked elevation of LDH displayed significantly higher leukocyte count (p=0.005; R-squared = 0.05), circulating blast percentage (p=0.03; R-squared = 0.07) and SRSF2 mutational frequency (44% vs 12%; p<0.0001). Survival analysis: After a median follow up of 3 years, 199 (64%) deaths and 31 (10%) leukemic transformations were documented. In univariate analysis, increased serum LDH level was associated with inferior survival, both as a continuous variable (p=0.002) and as a categorical variable with the cutoff level of 1000 U/L (HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.3-3.1; p=0.001); the survival effect LDH \u22651000/L was independent of DIPSS-plus (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.5). Other variables that were significantly associated with shortened survival, on univariate analysis, included all 8 DIPSS-plus variables (p\u22640.01 in all instances), absence of CALR type 1/type 1-like (p<0.0001) and presence of ASXL1 (p<0.0001) or SRSF2 (p=0.0006) mutations. In multivariable analysis that included only genetic risk factors, serum LDH retained its significance (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.6), along with absence of CALR type 1/type 1-like, or presence of ASXL1 or SRSF2 mutations or unfavorable karyotype. In multivariable analysis that included only clinical variables, serum LDH \u22651000/L was again independently predictive of poor survival (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6), along with age >65 years, hemoglobin 25 x 10(9)/L and constitutional symptoms. Patients with marked LDH elevation were also more likely to undergo leukemic transformation (HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2-7.6). Conclusion The current study suggests that marked elevation of serum LDH in PMF indicates aggressive tumor biology that is currently not accounted for by established clinical or genetic risk factors; the low R-squared values seen in relation to leukocyte count and circulating blasts are consistent with this assumption.
