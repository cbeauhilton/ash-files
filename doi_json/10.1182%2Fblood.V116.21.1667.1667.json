    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1667 Patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) have high risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we attempted to identify cell surface markers for leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) in FA AML patients. We found that interleukin-3 receptor alpha (IL-3R alpha) is a promising candidate as an LIC-specific antigen for FA AML. While IL-3R alpha expression is undetectable on normal CD34 + CD38 - hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), it is overexpressed on CD34 + CD38 - cells from FA patients with AML. We have examined whether the LIC activity of IL-3R alpha-positive FA AML cells in a \u201chumanized\u201d FA xenotransplant model, in which we separated AML cells into IL-3R alpha-positive and IL-3R alpha-negative CD34 fractions and transplanted them into irradiated recipient mice. In all three FA AML samples, only IL-3R alpha-positive cells showed significant levels of engraftment and developed leukemia in the recipient mice. The FA CD34 + IL-3R alpha + blasts isolated from leukemic mice exhibited hypersensitivity to IL-3 deprivation and JAK2-STAT5 overactivation following IL-3 treatment. Finally, pretreatment of FA CD34 + IL-3R alpha + blasts with the IL-3Ra neutrolizing antibody inhibits IL-3-mediated proliferation and STAT5 activation. These results demonstrate that IL-3Ra is a cell surface marker present on FA AML-LIC and may serve a valuable therapeutic target. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
