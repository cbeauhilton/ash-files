    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3221 Human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) play a central role in regulating adaptive T cell responses in the course of neoplastic, viral and autoimmune disorders. Recently, we demonstrated that apart from their pro-inflammatory effects, which are mainly mediated by secretion of interferon-alpha (IFN-a), pDC can also exhibit potent anti-inflammatory functions borne by active secretion of granzyme B (GrB), a serine protease classically known from CTL, NK cells and regulatory T cells. Here, we hypothesized, that commonly used anti-viral vaccines may affect pDC on several levels including their immunophenotype as well as their capacity to secrete either IFN-a or GrB. Using various methods including FACS, ELISpot, ELISA, spinning-disk confocal microscopy and RT-PCR, we could demonstrate that various anti-viral vaccines including vaccines against TBEV, yellow fever, polio, measles, rotavirus, varicella and hepatitis B were able to affect pDC by modulating expression of a series of surface molecules involved in cell adhesion, antigen-presentation and co-stimulation. In addition, major differences between the vaccines were found in terms of their effects on secretion of IFN-a and GrB. Interestingly, while only one vaccine, FSME Immun (TBEV) induced substantial IFN-a responses in pDC, all others tested did not. In contrast, virtually all vaccines tested induced more or less strong suppression of GrB secretion by maturing pDC. Of note, pDC that secreted high amounts of GrB induced by far lower allogeneic T cell proliferation as compared to pDC that secreted little or no GrB. Moreover, suppression of pDC-derived GrB by a substrate-specific GrB inhibitor resulted in significant enhancement of T cell proliferation in co-cultures of GrB-secreting pDC with allogeneic T cells. Our data demonstrate 1) that anti-viral vaccines may have distinct effects on both the immunophenotype and the secretory potential of pDC, and 2) that GrB is an important novel variable affecting the capacity of pDC to either trigger or dampen adaptive T cell responses. Our results may have implications for further study of the role pDC play in the regulation of adaptive immune responses, and for the potential application of this knowledge in the development of novel adjuvants admixed to anti-viral vaccines.
