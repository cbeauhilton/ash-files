    "abstract_text": "Background Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is known to have an aggressive clinical course and be associated with poor survival. The International Prognostic Index (IPI) score and the Prognostic Index for T-cell lymphoma (PIT) have been suggested as methods to predict the prognosis of PTCL. Ferritin, the iron storage protein, is associated with chronic inflammation. Although higher levels of serum ferritin are detected in many cancer patients, the significance of elevated serum ferritin as a prognostic factor for lymphoma has yet to be established. Thus, our retrospective study aimed to examine the prognostic value of serum ferritin levels in PTCL. Patients and Methods Serum ferritin levels were evaluated in 78 patients with PTCL, who were treated with anthracycline-containing regimens in 8 institutions affiliated to the Yokohama City University Hematology Group between 1998 and 2011. Fourteen patients received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP); 44 receivedpirarubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (THP-COP); 3 received THP-COP followed by radiotherapy; 3 received up-front autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation; and 14 received THP-COP at 2-week intervals in a clinical trial. Results The study population comprised 50 male and 28 female patients with a median age of 64 years at the time of diagnosis (range, 16\u201383 years). With regard to the PTCL subtype, 39 patients had PTCL, not otherwise specified, and 39 had angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Twelve patients had localized disease and 66 patients had advanced Ann Arbor stage lymphoma. Twenty-three patients had a poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) of 2\u20134. B symptoms were present in 34 patients. Risk stratification according to the IPI was as follows: low risk, 9 patients; low\u2013intermediate risk, 20 patients; high\u2013intermediate (HI) risk, 30 patients; and high (H) risk, 19 patients. According to the PIT, 4 patients were categorized into group 1, 25 into, group 2 , 28 into, group 3, 21 into, as group 4. The median observation period for the surviving patients was 50 months. The median serum ferritin level was 183 ng/ml (range, 5\u201314,622 ng/ml). Factors associated with a poor overall survival (OS) in univariate analysis were HI and H risk status with regard to IPI ( P = 0.024), assignment to group 3 or 4 with regard to PIT ( P = 0.017), poor performance status ( P < 0.001), and ferritin levels \u2265 300 ng/ml ( P < 0.001). The 4-year OS rate of all 78 patients was 54%. The 4-year OS rate was poorer in patients with serum ferritin levels \u2265300 ng/ml (n = 21) than in those with serum ferritin levels< 300ng/ml (n = 57; 22% vs. 65%; P < 0.001) (Figure). Multivariate analysis including each factor comprising the IPI (age, lactate dehydrogenase level, PS, Ann Arbor stage, and number of extranodal lesions), gender, bone marrow involvement, and serum ferritin level showed that poor PS ( P = 0.002, relative risk [RR] 3.6) and a serum ferritin level \u2265300 ng/ml ( P = 0.014, RR 2.7) were independent risk factors for poor OS.
