    "abstract_text": "Insights into the regulation of platelet adhesion have historically been aided by congenital bleeding disorders. Two clinically similar disorders, distinct at the molecular level, are platelet-type von Willebrand disease (Pt-vWD) and type 2B von Willebrand disease (vWD). In each case, the receptor (Pt-vWD) or ligand (type 2B vWD) has undergone a structural change supporting the binding of soluble von Willebrand factor (vWF) to platelets. The net result is an increased affinity between circulating vWF and the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX receptor leading to thrombocytopenia and the risk of a bleeding event. In the case of Pt-vWD several missense mutations within the glycoprotein (GP) Ib\u03b1 subunit of the GP Ib-IX complex have been described as the cause of Pt-vWD. The first described genetic mutation produces a Gly 233 to Val 233 (G233V) substitution within the GP Ib\u03b1 amino-terminus. Crystallographic studies of isolated recombinant domains of GP Ib\u03b1 have documented structural perturbations within the vWF binding site as a consequence of the G233V substitution. The hypothesis exists that these structural changes lead to an increased affinity between GP Ib-IX and vWF. We report the generation of mice expressing a human GP Ib\u03b1 subunit with a G233V substitution. The animals were generated by traditional transgenic techniques using the human GP Ib\u03b1 promoter sequence. Human Pt-vWD is autosomally dominant where both wild-type GP Ib\u03b1 and Pt-vWD variant alleles are present. Mice expressing the G233V transgene were bred to mice deficient in mouse GPIb\u03b1 producing a number of different genotypes for characterization. Mouse platelets were characterized from animals with ( i ) wild-type mouse GP Ib\u03b1 alleles (mGp1b+/+); ( ii ) devoid of murine GP Ib\u03b1 but expressing a wild-type human GPIb\u03b1 allele (mGp1b\u2212/\u2212;hGp1b+); ( iii ) a single mouse GPIb\u03b1 wild-type allele and the human G233V variant (mG1b+/\u2212;hGp1bG233V); and ( iv ) devoid of murine GP Ib\u03b1 and expressing the human G233V variant (mGp1b\u2212/\u2212;hGp1bG233V). In vivo, the effect of the Pt-vWD G233V human variant produces a mouse thrombocytopenia with increased bleeding as determined in tail bleeding time assays. The most severe phenotype was observed in mice with the mGp1b\u2212/\u2212;hGp1bG233V genotype. One of the diagnostic characteristics of human Pt-vWD is the agglutination of platelets with subthreshold levels of the agonist, ristocetin. Platelet-rich plasma from mice expressing the G233V variant (mGp1b-/-;hGp1bG233V) aggregate with ristocetin (0.25 mg/ml) unlike their counterparts expressing a wild-type human GP Ib\u03b1 sequence (mGp1b\u2212/\u2212;hGp1b+) that require at least 0.8 mg/ml ristocetin. To observe the ristocetin effect required supplementing mouse platelet-rich plasma with purified human vWF illustrating the species-specificity of ristocetin for human vWF. The characterization of this model documents an animal with hyperfunctional platelets owing to an increased vWF/GP Ib-IX interaction. The generation of a Pt-vWD murine model provides an in vivo setting to examine the role of platelets with increased adhesive potential in diseases where the platelet is gaining recognition as important mediators of inflammatory responses, tumor metastases and angiogenesis.",
