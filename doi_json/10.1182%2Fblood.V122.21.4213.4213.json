    "abstract_text": "Background Allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) is the only curative method for a number of monogenic blood disorders, including various forms of hemoglobinopathies and severe combined immunodeficiencies. Aside from the significant hurdle of finding an identical HLA-matched related donor, allogeneic BMT recipients require chronic immunosuppression to mitigate the significant risk of GVHD and are at greater risk for graft failure. Autologous gene modified HSPC potentially provide a much safer alternative to allogeneic BMT and abrogate the need for finding HLA-matched donors. Here, we report the development of a highly efficient process for generating gene modified human HSPC at clinical-scale (>150 x 10^6 cells for 2x10^6/kg) using clinical-grade equipment. Methods Healthy donors were administered Neupogen\u00ae (10mg/kg/day) for 4-5 consecutive days and then apheresed. Enrichment of CD34+ cells was performed with the Miltenyi CliniMACS\u00ae system. Genome editing was achieved via the introduction of mRNA encoding two engineered zinc finger nucleases (ZFN) using a scalable electroporation device. Cells were harvested and cryo-preserved with a controlled-rate freezer. Cell recovery and viability, gene modification efficiency, stem cell pluripotency and engraftment potential were evaluated by in vitro assays and in a humanized NSG mouse model. Results Enrichment of CD34+ cells from mobilized leukopak products was highly efficient with the Miltenyi CliniMACS\u00ae system (median recovery = 327 million CD34+ cells per 10L mobilized leukopak). The positively selected fractions were >98% CD34+ by FACS analysis. Two large scale electroporation devices (BTX AgilePulse Max\u00ae and MaxCyte GT\u00ae) were evaluated. Each device is capable of electroporating up to 300 million cells. The optimal transfection conditions for both devices were first identified by using a GFP mRNA to evaluate transfection efficiency by flow cytometry, which resulted in the identification of conditions (voltage and duration) that yielded gene transfer efficiencies of >90%. Compatibility of this protocol with driving endogenous gene modification was evaluated using mRNA encoding ZFNs that target various endogenous gene loci. Highly efficient levels of genome editing were observed in CD34+ HSPC each transfected with a different pair of ZFNs (median = 53%, 43%, 45% and 42% modified alleles at four distinct disease-relevant loci). At the optimal mRNA dose for each ZFN pair, cell viability post electroporation was >80%, comparable to untransfected controls. Process suitability was evaluated by in vitro colony forming cell assay. No significant differences in colony formation were observed between gene modified and untransfected control samples. The capacity of electroporated HSPC to engraft and support multi-lineage development of human hematopoietic cells was evaluated in NSG mice, and no differences were observed between the ZFN-treated and untransfected control cells. In addition, high levels of gene modification (19-28%) were detected in bulk human cells from the blood and tissues of engrafted mice, and in various sorted cell types (bone marrow CD34 and differentiated B and T cells). Conclusion We have developed a scalable process capable of deriving >300 million gene-modified CD34+ HSPC. This process supports high levels of ZFN-driven genome editing, is well tolerated, and causes no discernable defect in the hematopoietic potential of these cells to develop into multiple cell lineages, with high gene editing levels maintained in the differentiated progeny of the HSPC. These results support the use of gene modified autologus HSPC for the treatment of monogenic blood disorders. Disclosures: Lee: Sangamo BioSciences: Employment.
