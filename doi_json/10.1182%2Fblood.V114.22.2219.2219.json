    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2219 Poster Board II-196 Objective The \u03b3\u0394+ T cells can act as a vast functional setting of immune defense against pathogenic invaders in chronic inflammatory reactions, as well as in modulating systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases. Recently, it was reported that \u03b3\u0394+ T cells might play an important role in regulation of graft versus host disease (GVHD), mediation of graft versus leukemia effect, anti-virus infection, anti-cancer effect and so on. But the frequency of T cell receptor (TCR) V\u03b3 repertoire and the expression patterns of TCR V\u03b3 subfamilies in GVHD remain unknown. To further study on the characteristics of TCR V\u03b3 subfamilies in GVHD, we investigated the frequency of TCR V\u03b3 repertoire and the expression of TCR V\u03b3 I\u223cIII subfamilies genes in the patients with GVHD after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Methods The expression and cloanlity analysis of TCR V\u03b3 repertoire was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) from 25 patients with GVHD by RT-PCR and genescan technique. The TCR V\u03b3 I\u223cIII genes expression levels of PBMNCs from patients with GVHD were detected using the real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction with SYBR Green I technique and relative quantification method. Twelve healthy individuals served as normal controls. Results The RT-PCR results showed that in GVHD patients, the expression frequency of TCR V\u03b3 I was 88.0% (22/25), TCR V\u03b3 II was 72.0% (18/25), and TCR V\u03b3 III was 96.0% (24/25). All of the three TCR V\u03b3 subfamilies could be detected in PBMNCs from the normal controls. TCR V\u03b3 repertoires with polyclonal pattern were identified in normal controls. However, the skew expression pattern of TCR V\u03b3 repertoire could be detected in patients with GVHD even more than 4 year after allo-HSCT. Oligoclonal or monoclonal expanded T cells were identified in TCR V\u03b3 I\u223cIII subfamilies in GVHD patients. The expression level of TCR V\u03b3 II gene in the PBMNCs from patients with GVHD was significant lower than the normal controls ( P TCR V\u03b3 III> TCR V\u03b3 II, however, the expression pattern in normal controls was TCR V\u03b3 II> TCR V\u03b3 I > TCR V\u03b3 III. Conclusions The expression patterns of TCR V\u03b3 I\u223cIII subfamilies were changed in GVHD. The low expression of TCR V\u03b3 II subfamily might be related with the pathogenesis of GVHD.
