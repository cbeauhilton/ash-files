    "abstract_text": "Previously we have reported that over-expression of RNA-binding protein Pum2 supports self-renewal and severely attenuates mutilineage differentiation of murine HSC-like cell line EML. To analyze further the impact of Pum2 on maintenance and differentiation of EML cells, we examined the expression of c-kit, Sca-1, Flk-2 and CD34 HSC markers on wild type EML cells and EML cells over-expressing Pum2 (Pum2-EML cells). Almost all wt EML cells are Sca-1 + c-kit + Flk2 \u2212 , but exhibit heterogeneous expression of CD34, with 20\u201340% of cells being CD34 \u2212 , and 60\u201380% of cells being CD34 + . Similarly, almost all Pum2-EML cells are Sca-1 + c-kit + Flk2 \u2212 , but the vast majority of Pum2-EML cells are CD34 \u2212 (80\u201395%). To determine the functional significance of this change in CD34 expression, wt EML and Pum2-EML cells were sorted into CD34 + and CD34 \u2212 populations (>99% purity), and their differentiation capacity assessed using colony-forming assays. The wt EML and Pum2-EML CD34 + cell population repeatedly contained almost all of the cells capable of mutilineage differentiation in response to cytokines, and forming for example BFU-E, CFU-Meg and CFU-GM colonies. In contrast, the CD34 \u2212 subpopulation of wt EML and Pum2-EML cells differentiated poorly or not at all. Thus, in terms of the phenotype and cytokine-induced differentiation the CD34 \u2212 and CD34 + subpopulations of EML cells resemble CD34 \u2212 and CD34 + subpopulations of HSC-enriched Lin \u2212 Sca-1 + c-kit + Flk-2 \u2212 BM cells. Our results also raised the question of developmental relationship between CD34 \u2212 and CD34 + EML cells. Interestingly, several studies have shown that mouse CD34 \u2212 HSC become CD34 + after G-CSF mobilization or 5-FU treatment, and that after transplant these \u201cactivated\u201d CD34 + HSC revert back to CD34 \u2212 \u201cinactive\u201d state. These studies have uncovered a putative new link between HSC activation and CD34 expression. In view of these findings we tested whether CD34 \u2212 and CD34 + EML cell populations represent different developmental stages, where e.g. CD34 \u2212 cells give rise to CD34 + cells, or whether CD34 expression is linked to cell \u201cactivation\u201d, and EML cells can alternate between CD34 \u2212 inactive (differentiation inhibited) and CD34 + active (differentiation ready) state. For that purpose sorted CD34 \u2212 and CD34 + EML cells (>99% pure) were cultured separately for 3 weeks. An aliquot of cells from these cultures was taken each day and analyzed by flow cytometry for CD34 expression. These experiments have revealed that CD34 + cells started to appear in CD34 \u2212 cell cultures after 24 hours, and were maintained at different frequencies throughout the culture. Interestingly, we also observed initial slow appearance of CD34 \u2212 cells in CD34 + cell cultures, however their percentage subsequently increased and was maintained during the culture period. Taken together, our results suggest that Sca-1 + c-kit + Flk2 \u2212 CD34 \u2212 population of EML cells is in \u201cinactive\u201d self-renewal state and differentiates poorly or not at all, whereas the CD34 + population could represent \u201cactivated\u201d state at which the cells are ready to undergo differentiation. Furthermore, our results indicate that normally a balance is maintained between CD34 \u2212 inactive and CD34 + active state of EML cells, and that increased levels of Pum2 protein tip that balance and maintain the cells in the CD34 \u2212 inactive state, thus promoting proliferation and inhibiting differentiation, two critical components of self-renewal."
