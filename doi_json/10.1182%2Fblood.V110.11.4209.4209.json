    "abstract_text": "Thyroid hormone has been recently shown to induce tumor growth and angiogenesis. These angiogenesis modulating activities are initiated at endothelial cell plasma membrane receptor via the integrin \u03b1V\u03b23, at or near the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) recognition site on the integrin. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), a deaminated thyroid hormone analog that inhibits thyroid hormone-binding to the cell surface integrin, on angiogenesis and cancer cell resistance to doxorubicin both in vitro and in vivo. Two angiogenesis models were studied in which vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF165 or basic fibroblast growth factor, FGF2 (1\u20132 \u03bcg/ml) or thyroid hormone, thyroxin (L-T4 or T3) were used either to induce tube formation in the human dermal micro-vascular endothelial cells (HDMEC), or to stimulate new blood vessel branch formation in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) models. In both models, Tetrac (0.1\u201310 \u03bcM) inhibited the pro-angiogenesis activity of VEGF, FGF2, L-T4 or T3 by more than 50% at 1.0 uM RT-PCR revealed that tetrac (1\u20133 \u03bcM) decreased abundance of angiopoietin-2 mRNA but did not affect the mRNA levels of angiopoietin-1, in VEGF-exposed endothelial cells, suggesting that specific angiogenic pathways are targeted by this compound. Additionally, microarray was used to examine changes in expression of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP) and Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases (TIMP) following VEGF treatment with and without tetrac. HDMEC cells treated with VEGF exhibited 3\u20135-fold increase in MMP-15 and MMP-19 expression and tetrac (3\u03bcM), inhibited expression of MMP-15 and MMP-19 by 3\u20139-fold, respectively. Expression of TIMP-3 was increased 5.4-fold following VEGF and tetrac treatment when compared to treatment with VEGF alone. This finding suggests that part of the mechanism by which tetrac inhibits VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis involves inhibition of certain MMPs and increase in TIMP expression. Investigation of the anti-proliferative function of tetrac was carried out using the \u03b1V\u03b23 expressing breast cancer cells MC7 and their drug resistant counterparts. Interestingly, proliferation of both cell lines was inhibited similarly by tetrac suggesting that this analog may circumvent drug resistance. In fact, tetrac was able to reverse resistance to doxorubicin in vitro and to suppress growth of doxorubicin resistant tumors in nude mice. Inhibition of the drug transporter p-glycoprotein was found to play a key role in mediating the action of tetrac. Taken together, findings presented in this study provide evidence that the anticancer function of tetrac can be attributed to its anti-angiogenic and drug resistance reversal activities.",
