    "abstract_text": "Abstract 372 The regulation of erythropoiesis requires stem cell factor and erythropoietin (EPO) for the proliferation and survival of erythroid progenitor and early precursor cells. While recombinant EPO is widely used for treating various types of anemia, it often lacks efficacy in cases of anemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis in which immature erythroid precursors undergo apoptosis. Thus, there is an need for new therapies to treat the later stages of erythropoiesis. Members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) superfamily have been studied as potential regulators of erythropoiesis, iron regulation and globin expression. Sotatercept (ACE-011), a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of the human activin receptor IIA (ActRIIA) linked to the human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) Fc domain, is a ligand trap which binds a number of TGF\u03b2 superfamily ligands including activin A, activin B, growth differentiation factor-11 (GDF-11) and bone morphogenetic protein-10 (BMP-10). Administration of sotatercept led to substantial increases in red cell number and hemoglobin in human subjects, but the mechanism is not fully understood. We utilized both mouse in vivo and human in vitro models to investigate the mechanism of sotatercept in promoting erythropoiesis. In order to compare the effects of RAP-011 (the murine version of sotatercept) to EPO on red blood cell (RBC) parameters, C57/Bl mice were dosed with RAP-011, EPO or control vehicle. RAP-011-treated mice had a rapid and statistically significant increase in hematocrit, hemoglobin, and RBC number in less than 72-hours. As rapidly as 24 hours after treatment, RAP-011 induced a significant increase in RNA-negative, enucleated cells in the bone marrow (BM). RAP-011 also rapidly increased BM BFU-e and CFU-e erythroid progenitors, while EPO was more effective on spleen-derived progenitors. These data suggest that RAP-011 acts primarily on both bone marrow progenitor cells and late erythroblasts to promote erythropoiesis. In order to investigate the cellular mechanism by which RAP-011 increases red blood cell parameters, we conducted a series of in vitro experiments and found no evidence to support direct effects of RAP-011 on human CD34+ cells assessed in colony formation assays and in erythroid differentiation in liquid culture. As both clinical and pharmacological findings point to a clear role for RAP-011 in stimulating RBC parameters, we hypothesized that RAP-011 effects may be mediated by accessory cells in the BM microenvironment. Human CD36+ cells, which are highly enriched for erythroid progenitors, were co-cultured with long-term BM cultures and erythroid differentiation was assessed following 6 days of culture in EPO (2U/mL)-supplemented media. At day 6 the output of these cultures was predominantly characterized as EryA (\u223cbasophilic erythroblast) but with the addition of RAP-011 (50\u03bcM), a significant fraction of CD36+ cells matured into EryB/C cells (polychromatic/orthochromatic erythroblasts), suggesting that factors produced by BM accessory cells mediate RAP-011 erythropoietic effects and that, in contrast to EPO, RAP-011 may play a role in the latter stages of erythroblast maturation. To identify cytokines that may mediate RAP-011 effects, CD36+ cells were treated with several activin receptor IIA ligands. GDF-11 treatment significantly decreased proliferation of GPA+ cells during the differentiation process and RAP-011 effectively reversed this effect, but had no consequence on untreated cells. These data suggest that GDF-11 may mediate the erythroipoietic stimulatory effects of RAP-011. In summary, RAP-011 induced a rapid increase in RBC parameters in mice (reflected in the number of enucleated cells found in the bone marrow), likely mediated by BM accessory cells. Our data also suggest that effects of sotatercept may be mediated at least partly by GDF-11, acting as a potential negative regulator of the terminal stages of erythropoiesis. The ability of sotatercept to reverse this inhibition would lead to a rapid release of terminal erythroid cells into the circulation. These data support the rationale to develop sotatercept for the treatment of anemia and ineffective erythropoiesis, especially in patients who may not respond to EPO.
