    "abstract_text": "Antithrombin (AT) is a major physiological inhibitor of coagulation factors, primarily inhibiting thrombin and factor Xa (FXa). Binding of heparin and its related pentasaccharides, fondaparinux, to AT dramatically accelerates inhibition of thrombin and FXa. Entire AT-dependency of heparins may result in decreased anticoagulant effects in patients with inherited or acquired AT deficiencies. Objectives: We have developed an orally active direct (i.e. AT-independent) FXa inhibitor, DU-176b. The objectives of this study were to examine the anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects of DU-176b, fondaparinux, and heparin in heterozygous AT deficient ( AT+/ \u2212) mice (Refs 1 , 2 ), and to determine the impact of AT deficiency on the efficacies of these anticoagulants. Methods: [In vitro study] Plasma obtained from wild type ( AT+/+ , C57BL/6J) and AT+/ \u2212 mice were subjected to measurement of levels of AT antigen and activity. The anticoagulant effects on prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was measured and the drug concentrations were calculated required to double the clotting time (CT2). [In vivo study] Male AT+/+ and AT+/ \u2212 mice were fasted over night. Thrombosis was induced in the inferior vena cava by applying filter paper (1 x 5 mm) presoaked in 15% FeCl3 for 10 min. Thrombus was removed 60 min after FeCl3 treatment and its protein content was assessed by Bradford method. DU-176b was orally administered 60 min before, fondaparinux was given s.c. 30 min before, and heparin was injected into the jugular vein 3 min before thrombus induction. Relative potencies of antithrombotic effects in AT+/ \u2212 mice to those in AT+/+ mice were analyzed by parallel line assay. Results: [In vitro study] Plasma levels of AT antigen and activity in AT+/ \u2212 mice were deceased to 40% compared with AT+/+ plasma. PT-CT2 of DU-176b was 0.72 \u03bcM in AT+/+ plasma and 0.74 \u03bcM in AT+/ \u2212 plasma, respectively, indicating that anticoagulant activity of the direct FXa inhibitor was not affected by heterozygous AT deficiency. APTT-CT2 of fondaparinux and heparin in AT+/+ plasma was 3.8 \u03bcM and 14 mU/mL, respectively, whereas APTT-CT2 in AT+/ \u2212 plasma was 9.2 \u03bcM and 20 mU/mL, respectively. Therefore, anticoagulant activities of such AT-dependent inhibitors were attenuated in AT+/ \u2212 plasma. [In vivo study] All three anticoagulants inhibited venous thrombus formation of AT+/+ mice in dose-dependent manners. In AT+/ \u2212 mice, the antithrombotic effects of fondaparinux and heparin were less potent than those in AT+/+ mice. In contrast, DU-176b prevented thrombus formation equipotently in both mice. Relative potencies of DU-176b, fondaparinux and heparin were 0.84, 0.40, and 0.70, respectively. Conclusion: DU-176b exerts a comparable antithrombotic effect even in individuals with low plasma AT antigens and activities. Thus, DU-176b may be prioritized over AT-dependent agents for use at the fixed dose in patients with lower plasma AT concentrations.",
