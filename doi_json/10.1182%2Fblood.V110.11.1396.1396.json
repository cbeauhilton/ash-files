    "abstract_text": "Background : IFN-\u03b12 is indicated for the therapy of hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, follicular lymphoma, and malignant melanoma. As is the case for most cytokines, the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of IFN-\u03b12 are critical for dosing and efficacy. In vivo , the protein is quickly degraded, diffuses widely throughout the body, and has a rapid rate of renal clearance. Pegylation of IFN-\u03b12 significantly increases the serum half-life and reduces renal clearance, thus enhancing its efficacy. However, established pegylation of IFN-\u03b12 results in a mixture of positional isomers and reduced in vitro activity, as known for PEGASYS (Roche) and PEG-INTRON (Schering-Plough). Methods: To improve the PK properties and the potency, the DNL method (Rossi et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2006,103:6841 ) was used to generate novel agents having two copies of IFN-\u03b12b conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG). Results: A fusion protein (DDD2-IFN-\u03b12b) composed of IFN-\u03b12b with a dimerization-and-docking domain (DDD2) and a six-His tag was expressed both in myeloma cells and in E. coli . Two PEG-based modules, each composed of a fluorescent molecule, an anchor domain (AD) and either a 20-kDa PEG (IMP362) or a 30-kDa PEG (IMP413), were synthesized. Combining DDD2-IFN-\u03b12b and IMP362 or IMP413 under redox conditions resulted in the desirable DNL conjugates consisting of two copies of IFN-\u03b12b and one PEG linked site-specifically via the DDD and AD interaction. The cytotoxic activity of DDD2-IFN-\u03b12b on Daudi lymphoma cells was similar to that of commercially available recombinant IFN-\u03b12 (rhIFN-\u03b12). The purity and identity of the two DNL conjugates (\u03b12b-413 and \u03b12b-362) were demonstrated by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, and fluorescence imaging. Both also showed potent cytotoxic activity on Daudi cells in vitro and superior PK properties to PEG-INTRON. For example, the mean blood residence times for \u03b12b-362 (10.3 h) and \u03b12b-413 (21.7 h) were significantly longer than those of rhIFN-\u03b12 (0.7 h) and PEG-INTRON (5.1 h). Initial studies in mice bearing Daudi xenografts showed a significant therapeutic advantage over PEG-INTRON for both \u03b12b-362 and \u03b12b-413. Animals given 14,000 IU of PEG-INTRON had a median survival (MS) of 32 days compared to 21 days for saline control, whereas those receiving \u03b12b-362 at 14,000 IU, 7,000 IU and 3,500 IU resulted in MS of 45, 41 and 32 days, respectively. More remarkably, \u03b12b-413 was the most effective, achieving MS of 46, >53, and >53 days with 3,500 IU, 7,000 IU and 14,000 IU, respectively, all statistically significant improvements ( P< 0.0028 ) compared to PEG-INTRON given at each equivalent activity. Conclusions: The DNL method provides a novel pegylation strategy for generating a dimeric IFN-\u03b12b that is linked site-specifically to a single PEG at the predetermined location. Since the resulting conjugates exhibit improved PK and efficacy in a Burkitt lymphoma model, they may represent a new class of interferons for use in cancer and infectious disease therapy.",
