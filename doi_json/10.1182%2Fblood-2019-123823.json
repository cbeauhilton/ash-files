    "abstract_text": "Adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a rare and unique population of stem cells that reside in the bone marrow, where they undergo self-renewal and differentiation to maintain the blood system. The maintenance of a proper balance between HSC self-renewal and differentiation requires growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, most of which activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Protein Kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway. Pathologic activation of the AKT pathway is frequently observed in tumors, making it a desirable target for cancer treatment. Since several PI3K inhibitors are now in clinical use, it is critical to determine the roles of PI3K in adult HSCs. However, the specific roles of PI3K in HSC function are poorly understood. Hematopoietic cells express three Class IA catalytic PI3K isoforms (P110\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b4), which can all transduce growth factor and cytokine signals, and can compensate for one another in some cell types. Individual Class 1A PI3K isoforms have unique functions in mature hematopoietic lineages, but are dispensable for HSC function. To uncover the potentially redundant roles of PI3K isoforms in HSCs, we have generated a triple knockout (TKO) mouse model with conditional deletion of p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2 in hematopoietic cells using MX1-Cre, and germline deletion of p110\u03b4 . TKO mice develop pancytopenia, which is also observed upon transplantation of TKO bone marrow. Competitive repopulation assays reveal a defect in long-term multi-lineage chimerism. Surprisingly, loss of Class 1A PI3K causes significant expansion of donor-derived long-term (Lin - cKit + Flk2 - CD150 + CD48 - ) and short-term (Lin - cKit + Flk2 - CD150 - CD48 - ) HSCs in the bone marrow, but not committed progenitors. This phenotype could not be explained by alterations in HSC cell cycling or apoptosis in TKO HSCs. TKO transplant recipients also have dysplastic features in the bone marrow. Methylcellulose plating assays of TKO bone marrow revealed a relative increase in granulocyte erythroid macrophage megakaryocyte (GEMM) colonies and extended serial replating, suggesting increased self-renewal. Thus, our data are consistent with impaired HSC differentiation upon deletion of all Class IA PI3K isoforms, which leads to dysplastic changes. RNA sequencing of sorted long-term HSCs from the bone marrow of TKO transplant recipients revealed the enrichment of human and mouse HSC signatures, and the downregulation of DNA repair gene sets and RNA splicing gene sets in TKO HSCs. Interestingly, we also observed downregulation of autophagy gene sets in TKO HSCs. Macroautophagy has been shown to be essential for the maintenance of HSC metabolism and self-renewal. Analysis of the autophagosomal marker LC3-II in TKO HSCs revealed a decrease in autophagy upon growth factor deprivation. Surprisingly, we observed an increase in MTOR activation in TKO cKit + bone marrow cells via compensatory signaling through the MAPK pathway. Given that MTOR is a known negative regulator of autophagy, this is consistent with the observed autophagy decrease in TKO HSCs. Additionally, we found that autophagy can still be induced in TKO HSCs with the MTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Furthermore, rapamycin treatment impairs serial replating of TKO bone marrow cells. In conclusion, we found that inactivation of all Class 1A PI3 kinases leads to impaired HSC differentiation, likely due to a defect in autophagy induction in response to growth factor deprivation.
