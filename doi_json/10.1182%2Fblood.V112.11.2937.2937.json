    "abstract_text": "Background : The p53 protein is strongly regulated by the E3 ligase HDM-2, which specifically binds to p53 and causes proteosomal degradation. The p14 ARF protein activates p53 by binding to and inhibiting HDM-2. Design and methods : To further study the prognostic impact of p14 ARF in AML, leukemic cells from 57 adult patients with normal karyotype de novo AML were analysed for p14 ARF mRNA expression level using real-time PCR. We also measured the cytotoxicity against conventional cytostatics and PRIMA-1, a novel small molecule shown to activate mutated p53 ( Nature Medicine  2002 ; 8 : 282 \u2013288 ) using an ATP-assay. Intracellular p53 protein was measured by FACS after incubation with PRIMA-1 in combination with the HDM-2 blocking agent RITA ( Nature Medicine  2004 ; 10 : 1321 \u20131328 ) Results: Patients whose cells expressed more p14 ARF mRNA than the 75 th percentile (0.26) showed significantly better survival compared with those with lower levels, 61% vs. 30% 3-year survival ( p =0.033). The difference remained significant also when NPM1/FLT3 status was considered. The mean effects of all tested conventional antileukemic drugs were greater in leukemic cell samples expressing p14 ARF mRNA \u22650.26, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, PRIMA-1 had a significantly greater effect on leukemic cell samples with low levels of p14 ARF mRNA and PRIMA-1 and RITA significantly increased intracellular p53 levels. Conclusions: Low level of p14 ARF mRNA in leukemic cells from patients with normal karyotype AML is a strong marker for poor prognosis and decreased sensitivity to conventional cytostatics. Treatment with drugs targeting p53 can be a future possibility to improve the outcome for these patients."
