    "abstract_text": "Backgrounds : Monosomy of chromosome 7 (monosomy 7) is observed in about 9% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and related to resistance to conventional chemotherapy and poor prognosis. It is required to establish an effective treatment strategy based on the specific molecular pathogenesis associated with the chromosomal abnormality. In this study, we aimed to find a novel therapeutic target in AML with monosomy 7. Methods and Results : Chromosome 7 encodes multiple genes regulating histone methylation such as EZH2 , KTM2C and KTM2E . Although loss of these genes is considered to contribute to the development of AML with monosomy 7, it may also be required for some leukemia cell functions. We hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of the epigenetic modifiers in the chromosome 7 is compensated by other epigenetic molecules in different chromosomes, and the AML cells with monosomy 7 are vulnerable to inhibition of those molecules. Based on this notion, we performed an RNA-interference (RNAi)-based screening by targeting 53 genes encoding epigenetic enzymes regulating histone methylation by using AML cell lines with monosomy 7: KG-1 and F-36P cells. We found that the siRNA-mediated knockdown of EED , BRD4 or BRDT significantly decreased cell viability in AML cells with monosomy 7 compared to K562 cells as the control without monosomy 7. Stable knockdown of EED expression by retroviral transduction of shRNA markedly attenuated proliferation as well as increased apoptosis specifically in leukemia cells with monosomy 7. Surprisingly, pharmacologic inhibition of EED , which blocks the binding of EED to the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), was only marginally effective for the monosomy 7 leukemia cells. These results suggest that EED supports survival of the monosomy 7 leukemia cells in a PRC2-independent manner. Recent studies showed that EED is not only a component of PRC2 but also interacts with the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). In contrast to modest effects of PRC2 inhibition, inhibition of PRC1 activity showed marked efficacy specifically in leukemia cells with monosomy 7. Co-inhibition of PRC1 and PRC2 synergistically suppressed proliferation of the monosomy 7-AML cells. These results collectively suggest that while both PRC1 and PRC2 cooperatively function, the PRC1 rather than PRC2 has a predominant role in the survival of monosomy 7 leukemia cells. In addition to EED , we identified BRD4 as an essential survival factors in AML with monosomy 7. Although inhibition of BET bromodomain proteins have already shown to be effective for a variety of AML, we showed that blockade of bromodomain proteins preferentially affected cellular proliferation of AML cells with monosomy 7. We then explored whether the deletion of specific genes within the chromosome 7 was responsible for increased sensitivity to BET bromodomain protein inhibition. K562 cells were individually treated with the siRNAs against 22 genes in the presence of a BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1. We found that knockdown of MLL3 or MLL5 resulted in increased apoptosis of the JQ1-treated K562 cells. We also confirmed that pharmacological inhibition of histone methyltransferase activity of MLL3 and MLL5 showed synergistic effects with JQ1 treatment in the leukemia cells. Conclusion : We identified EED and BRD4 as novel promising therapeutic targets in AML with monosomy 7. Disclosures Kagoya: Kyowa Kirin: Speakers Bureau; Nihon Shinyaku: Research Funding.
