    "abstract_text": "Development of tissues during embryogenesis and their homeostasis after formation are highly regulated by expression of coding and non-coding RNAs. Deadenylation is a core mechanism that regulates RNA function and fate by controlling turnover, abundance and maturation of RNA. Factors that promote or inhibit deadenylation control hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis, and inhibition of deadenylation limits differentiation of the HSCs. Importantly, RNA biogenesis has emerged as a mechanism underlying several inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFSs), such as Diamond Blackfan anemia, dyskeratosis congenita (DC) and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease ( PARN ) is a major deadenylation factor and demonstrates high specificity for single-stranded poly (A) tails of various RNA species. We recently identified biallelic mutations in PARN as a cause of hematopoietic failure and profound hypomyelination, similar to the severe form of DC, Hoyeraal-Hreidersson syndrome. We developed a zebrafish model to characterize the hematopoietic phenotype of a patient identified to have severe inherited bone marrow failure resulting from a combined deletion of PARN on one allele and missense mutation in the other. Zebrafish posses a single parn ortholog. Zebrafish parn protein shares homology and high sequence identity (~64%) to its human counterpart. Embryos were injected with either translation start-site or splice-site-blocking morpholino at the one-cell stage. Both morpholino injections resulted in anemic embryos at 48 hours post fertilization (hpf), as evidenced by reduced o-dianisidine staining and gata1 expression by whole-mount in situ hybrization and GFP + red cell numbers by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Morphant embryos also demonstrated reduced expression of myeloid cell markers including l-plastin , myeloperoxidase , and macrophage expressed gene 1 and were leukopenic as evidenced by reduced number of GFP+ myeloid cells. FACS analysis revealed that fluorescently labeled HSCs were increased in parn morphants. Early hematopoietic markers, lmo2 and fli1 , expressed in hemogenic and vascular tissue respectively, were also overexpressed in parn morphants. Furthermore, there was reduced global cell proliferation in morphant embryos as determined by phosphohistone H3 antibody staining. These findings suggest that the absence of parn results in a developmental arrest at the HSC stage with an inability to differentiate into leukocyte or erythroid lineages. Similarly, human cell culture data from PARN-deficient HSC/progenitor cells demonstrated markedly reduced colony forming capacity. By modeling parn deficiency in the zebrafish, we validate for the first time an IBMFS that results from biallelic mutations in a major deadenylating protein. Moreover, our zebrafish studies provide insight into the role of parn in maintaining HSC homeostasis/differentiation as the origin of the pancytopenia observed in this patient. Permanent knockouts in the zebrafish using CRISPR/Cas9 technology are underway, which will enable tracking the hematopoietic phenotype into adulthood. These studies have set the stage for critical translational research in a rare form of bone marrow failure as well as new insight into HSC regulation.
