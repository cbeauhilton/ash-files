    "abstract_text": "Recent success in immunomodulation of cancer has targeted immune checkpoints such as CTLA-4, PD-1 and PDL-1 to enhance adaptive immunity by stimulating production of tumor-selective, cytotoxic T cells. Anti-CD47mAbs enhance innate immunity by increasing the phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages leading to processing and presentation of tumor antigens to prime the adaptive T cell response. Many cancers, including hematologic cancers, up-regulate the expression of CD47 presumably to avoid immune destruction. Increased CD47 expression protects cancer cells from phagocytosis by sending a \u201cdon't eat me\u201d signal to macrophages via SIRPalpha, an inhibitory receptor that prevents phagocytosis of CD47-bearing cells. CD47mAbs that block the CD47/SIRPalpha interaction (\u201cblocking-only\u201d mAbs) enhance phagocytosis of cancer cells in vitro. We have identified two CD47mAbs, Vx-1000 and Vx-1004, both of which block the CD47/SIRPalpha interaction and promote phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages equally well. However, Vx-1004 also has the unique property of killing cancer cells, but not normal blood cells, via a direct, cell-autonomous, cytotoxic mechanism. Therefore, Vx-1004 is a dual-function antibody. Vx-1004 selectively kills a variety of hematologic cancer cells in vitro, while Vx-1000, the blocking-only mAb, does not as assessed by annexin V staining and flow cytometry ( Figure 1 ). In dose-response studies, cell death in leukemia cells was induced in 2 hrs by To determine if the tumor-toxic activity of Vx-1004 confers enhanced efficacy in vivo compared to Vx-1000, we compared them in two mouse hematologic cancer models: murine acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and B cell lymphoma (BCL). Briefly, 1x106 GFP-labeled C57BL/6 APL cells were injected IV into wild-type C57BL/6 mice that were then treated IP with 0.4 mg/kg of either Vx-1000 or Vx-1004 on the day of tumor injection and on days 3 and 6 following tumor injection, a very low dose and limited dosing regimen. On day 25, the blood of these mice was analyzed for the number of circulating APL cells. As shown in Figure 2, Vx-1000 did not significantly reduce tumor burden compared to the control group. In contrast, Vx-1004 significantly reduced tumor burden compared to controls, demonstrating greater efficacy of the dual-function CD47mAb. In addition, enhanced efficacy of Vx-1004 compared to Vx-1000 was demonstrated in BCL (Figure 3). In this model, NSG mice were injected with 1x106 murine A20 lymphoma cells subcutaneously and then treated with 0.4mg/kg/day of the CD47mAbs IP for the first five days following tumor injection. In this model, Vx-1000 also failed to inhibit tumor growth compared to controls while Vx-1004 significantly reduced tumor burden at 35 days compared to both the control and Vx-1000 groups, nearly four weeks after treatment was stopped. These data demonstrate increased anti-cancer efficacy with a dual-function CD47mAb that not only blocks the CD47/SIRPalpha interaction to increase phagocytosis of cancer cells, but also selectively kills cancer cells. These studies indicate that dual-function CD47mAbs may have better anti-tumor activity in vivo and support their use in human clinical trials.
