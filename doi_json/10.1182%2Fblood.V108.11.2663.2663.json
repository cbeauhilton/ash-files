    "abstract_text": "Cardiac T2* Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been recently used to evaluate myocardial iron deposition in patients with transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia major. No comparable studies have been published for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes receiving chronic red blood cell transfusion. Therefore we measured cardiac-MRI T2* in 16 patients (10 male, 6 female) with myelodysplastic syndromes (aged 54 \u2013 82 years, median age 67). All of them were transfusion dependent having received a median number of 60 (range 16\u2013225) packed red blood cell transfusion equivalent to 3.2 \u2013 45 (median 12) grams of iron. Nine have been irregularly and sporadically chelated by deferoxamine, seven were unchelated. Serum ferritin levels ranged from 1163 to 6241 mg/dl (median value 2086). None of the patients presented signs or symptoms of cardiac dysfunction at the time of the study. Cardiac-MRI T2*values obtained ranged from 5.6 to 80 (median value 46.5) milliseconds (ms). Correlation between serum ferritin and cardiac T2* value was weak ( r= 0.43, r 2 =0.18). According to D. Pennel we considered as significant of myocardial iron deposition a relaxation time \u2264 20ms. Cardiac T2* was < 20ms in 3 patients who had never used iron chelators (5.6, 12.4 and 8.5 ms, respectively). They had received 39, 101 and 200 units of red blood cell transfusion, corresponding to 7.8, 20 and 40 grams of iron, respectively. Of relevance 2 of them died within few months after the end of the study and one showed early signs of left ventricular dysfunction. None of the patients with a cardiac T2* value >20 ms showed instrumental nor clinical signs of cardiac deterioration in six months follow up. No patient who had received less than 39 transfusions presented cardiac T2* value \u226420 ms. Evaluation of myocardial iron deposition by T2* cardiac MRI could be recommendable in myelodyplasia patients who had received more than 30 packed red blood cells transfusisions.",
