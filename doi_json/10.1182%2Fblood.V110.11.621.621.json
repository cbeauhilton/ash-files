    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: The toxicity of commonly used myeloablative regimens is the main factor limiting applicability and restricting upper age limit for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). However, reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) protocols are associated with high risk of relapse. Previous dose-escalation trials revealed high-dose treosulfan-based conditioning an alternative treatment with myeloablative as well as antileukemic potential, accompanied by low non-hematological toxicity. The goal of this multicenter phase II trial was to evaluate safety and efficacy of treosulfan/fludarabine conditioning in AML patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-five patients (median age 45 years, range 19\u201359) with AML in 1 st (80%), 2 nd (17%), or 3 rd (3%) complete remission were treated with alloHSCT from either matched related (MRD, 40%) or unrelated donors (MUD, 60%). Preparative regimen consisted of treosulfan 14 g/m 2 /day on days \u22126 to \u22124, fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 /day on days \u22126 to \u22122, and in case of MUD-HSCT additionally ATG (Fresenius) 10 mg/kg/day on days \u22124 to \u22122. Graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and short-course methotrexate. 25% of the patients had an increased risk of toxicity for standard myeloablative conditioning regimens because of higher age or co-morbidities. RESULTS: All patients engrafted after a period of absolute neutropenia with the median time to ANC >0.5 G/L and PLT >50 G/L of 21 (13\u201339) days and 19 (11\u201348) days, respectively. The cumulative incidence of complete donor chimerism was 72% on day +28 and 92% on day +100. Most frequent CTC grade 3 or 4 complications until day 28 after transplantation were febrile neutropenia (28%), infection in neutropenia (16%), and mucositis (5%). None of the patients experienced severe hepatic toxicity, including VOD. After a median follow up of 457 days (98\u2013988), the probabilities of overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 years equaled 67% resp. 58% (MRD-HSCT) and 58% resp. 45% (MUD-HSCT, p=NS). The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 34% for MRD-HSCT and 37% for MUD-HSCT, whereas non-relapse mortality was 8% and 17%, respectively. Outcome was not significantly influenced by disease status (CR1 vs. \u2265CR2) or age. CONCLUSIONS: Conditioning therapy based on treosulfan at a dose of 3x14 g/m 2 in combination with fludarabine is very well tolerated, resulting in a low NRM. The regimen demonstrated reliable efficacy in AML patients with confirmed first or subsequent remission. Further randomized studies are warranted to verify advantageous survival results."
