    "abstract_text": "Background: The bone marrow (BM) niche protects acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells from chemotherapy. BM homing of AML cells is dependent on CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12; high levels of CXCR4 expression correlate with poor survival in AML. It is postulated that blocking the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis with a potent CXCR4 antagonist will disrupt the interaction of the leukemic blasts with the BM and augment the anti-leukemic effect of chemotherapy. BL-8040 (BKT140) is a short synthetic peptide which inhibits the binding of CXCR4 to CXCL12, resulting in the mobilization of leukemic blasts from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood. BL-8040 also inhibits CXCR4/CXCL12 mediated pro-survival ERK/Akt signaling and alters balance of pro/anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. BL-8040 has strong affinity for the CXCR4 receptor with long receptor occupancy, and, in contrast to other CXCR4 inhibitors, as a single agent induces apoptosis of leukemia cells ex-vivo in clinical samples. A clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of BL-8040 in combination with cytarabine (Ara-C) for the treatment of adult relapsed/refractory AML patients is currently ongoing (NCT01838395). Objective: To assess the safety, efficacy and pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetic parameters of BL-8040 in combination with Ara-C in first or second relapse and refractory AML patients. Method: The study includes a dose escalation phase (3+3 design) followed by an expansion phase. Each patient receives a once daily SC dose of BL-8040 monotherapy on days 1-2 followed by the same dose of BL-8040 plus Ara-C (1.5 g/m 2 for patients \u226560; 3 g/m 2 for patients <60) on days 3-7. Five dose levels of BL-8040 (0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25 and 1.5 mg/kg) have been tested. Extensive pharmacodynamic parameters such as CXCR4 expression on the leukemic cells, receptor occupancy, mobilization of leukemic cells and induction of apoptosis are being assessed after monotherapy with BL-8040 using peripheral blood sampling (PB) and BM aspirates at baseline and on day 3 prior to Ara-C administration. Clinical response to treatment is evaluated by BM biopsy on day 30 (-/+ 2). Results: Twenty two patients (median age, 61 y; range, 43-74 y) with relapsed/refractory AML were treated during the escalation phase. BL-8040 was escalated up to 1.5 mg/kg (recommended phase 2 dose) without reaching the MTD. Combination of BL-8040 with Ara-C was safe and well tolerated at all doses tested. Only one SAE (Sweet Syndrome) was reported as possibly related to study drug. The primary treatment related AEs were transient injection site and systemic reactions. The composite complete remission including complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) rate was 38% in subjects receiving BL-8040 doses of 1 mg/kg and higher (n=16). Two days of BL-8040 monotherapy triggered an average 40.2-fold (range 1.0-350.9) mobilization of immature AML progenitors (CD45+Low/CD34+/CD117+/HLA-DR+) from the BM to the PB. Moreover, a significant apoptotic effect on the immature leukemia progenitors in the BM following 2 days of BL-8040 monotherapy was noted. Flow cytometric evidence of apoptosis by BL-8040 was corroborated by an increase in cleaved caspase 3 positive blasts in day 3 bone marrow biopsies. In addition, BL-8040 treatment resulted in a median decrease of 57.7% (range, -10.4% to -96.2%) in the number of BM Leukemia progenitor cells (CD45+Low/CD34+/CD117+/HLA-DR+ out of total CD45+/CD34+ normal/progenitor cells) compared with the baseline biopsy. This decrease was accompanied with a 3.1 fold increase in granulocytes in the day 3 BM biopsy supporting differentiation effect. Finally, long receptor occupancy (up to 24 hours post dosing) was confirmed by FACS analysis measuring surface CXCR4 staining. Pharmacokinetics analysis confirmed dose incremental BL-8040 exposure with a short plasma half-life. Conclusions: The current data demonstrate that sustained blockade of the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis with BL-8040 has potent anti leukemic activity and in combination with Ara-C may improve the response typically achieved in this advanced AML population. Mechanistically, BL-8040 was able to induce apoptosis of leukemic progenitor cells, overcoming the stroma protection, inducing mobilization and differentiation.
