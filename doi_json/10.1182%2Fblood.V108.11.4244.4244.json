    "abstract_text": "Background: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) -based metabolomics has been suggested to be useful for exhaustive analysis of metabolic pathways of cells or tissues. We report our study on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BSCs) and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) using NMR-based metabolomics. Materials and Methods: Five-week-old Wister rats were used for this study. BSCs were harvested from the femur, ASCs from inguinal fat pads, and control fibroblasts from the abdominal dermis. The cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and harvested after two passages of the subculture. Then, the cells were subjected to freezing in liquid nitrogen and crushed to extract the aqueous metabolites. 1H-NMR spectra was measured and analyzed by a computer software (Alice2 for metabolome\u2122 and ADMEWORKS/ModelbuilderTM). Results: BSCs, ASCs and fibroblasts were clearly separated into three groups on a principal component analysis (PCA) plot. Conclusion: ASCs, BSCs and fibroblasts were considered to have different metabolic activities, and NMR-based metabolomics will henceforth be useful for the detection, analysis, and characterization of various kinds of stem cells.",
