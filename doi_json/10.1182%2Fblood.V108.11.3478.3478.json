    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the expansion of malignant plasma cells within the bone marrow. Their growth, survival, and migration are mediated in part via cytokines. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is necessary for sustaining the in vitro growth of many MM cell lines and enhancing the proliferation of explanted human myeloma cells. The mitogen-activated protein kinase family member, p38, is activated by cytokines and growth factors and plays a significant role in inflammatory diseases. However, its role in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma is poorly understood. Specific p38 inhibitors inhibit paracrine MM cell growth which is associated with IL-6 and VEGF secretion from bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Furthermore, p38 inhibition blocks TNF-alpha-induced IL-6 secretion in BMSCs, thereby further inhibiting MM cell growth and survival. Although these data suggest an important role for p38 in MM, the direct effects of p38 inhibiton on MM has not been extensively explored. Therefore, we investigated the effects of p38 inhibition on in vitro and in vivo IL-6 production and MM cell growth in vivo after lipopolysaccaride (LPS) stimulation. LPS has been shown to induce various cytokines, including TNF-alpha and IL-6, via the p38 pathway. ARRY-797, an orally bioavailable, small molecule inhibitor of p38 directly inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 production from RPMI-8226 (IC 50 = 100 pM) in vitro . In SCID-beige mice, LPS (3 \u03bcg/kg) induced IL-6 (7897 \u00b1 827 pg/mL) and TNF-alpha (1922 \u00b1 282 pg/mL) after 2 hours and these cytokines were inhibited by oral administration of ARRY-797 (30 mg/kg) by 91% and 95%, respectively. In MM xenograft models, ARRY-797 (30 mg/kg, BID, PO) inhibited RPMI 8226 tumor growth by 72% as a single agent and by 56% when LPS was administered to stimulate growth in vivo . In addition, ARRY-797 inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 in RPMI-8226 xenografts. Together, these data support a role for p38 in IL-6-mediated growth of multiple myelomas. To our knowledge, ARRY-797 is the first small molecule p38 inhibitor to demonstrate single agent activity in a MM xenograft model and it has been advanced into preclinical development.",
