    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4827 Objective: A novel orally administered small-molecule thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) agonist, ONO-7746, was investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled single dose escalation study for its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) in healthy subjects. Methods: A total of 48 subjects were enrolled into 6 cohorts of 8 subjects each. For each cohort, subjects were randomly assigned to receive ONO-7746 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. After a single dose of study drug on Day 1 of each cohort, all subjects in a cohort were assessed on Day 21 for their overall safety, tolerability and changes in platelet count prior to proceeding to the next higher dose. The doses of ONO-7746 applied for each successive cohort were adjusted per Dose-Escalation and Stopping Rules, i.e. the successive dose was only a 1.5-fold increase from the previous dose if either of the following were observed: Two subjects had a platelet count increase greater than 400 \u00d7 10 9 /L, or had a platelet count doubling from Baseline. Further dose escalation was terminated if 50% of the subjects in a cohort (4 subjects) demonstrated a platelet count increase > 400 \u00d7 10 9 /L or doubling from Baseline. This study completed a total of 6 cohorts including 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 150 mg. Intensive safety, tolerability, PK, and PD assessments were made throughout the study. Safety assessments included 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis and adverse event (AE) reporting. Plasma samples for ONO-7746 concentration-time analysis were collected at several time points. PD parameters included platelet count, platelet activation, and aggregation. Results: Dose escalation was only increased 1.5-fold after the 100-mg cohort because of increases in platelet count, and dose escalation was ultimately terminated after the 150-mg cohort because 50% of subjects had a platelet count increase to > 400 \u00d7 10 9 /L or doubling from Baseline. The mean platelet counts in the ONO-7746 cohorts increased from Baseline beginning on Days 3 or 4, peaked between Days 9 and 11, decreased from Days 11 or 13, and returned to baseline levels by Day 28. Maximum platelet count, change from Baseline values increased with ascending ONO-7746 dose level. The largest percent change from Baseline in platelet count (117.0%) was observed in the 150-mg cohort, compared with 14.7% in the placebo cohort. Platelet function as measured by the exploratory platelet aggregation and activation tests was not affected by administration of ONO-7746. The PK profile of ONO-7746 showed that the plasma concentrations reached Cmax at a median Tmax of 3.0 to 4.0 hours. The mean T1/2 ranged from 22 to 27 hours. The PK of ONO-7746 was linear in the dose range of 5 to 100 mg. In the dose range of 100 to 150 mg, Cmax and AUCinf increased greater than dose proportionally. One subject in the 150-mg cohort had an adverse event of special interest (AESI) of increased platelet count > 500 \u00d7 10 9 /L that was considered mild in severity. There were no deaths, serious AEs, severe AEs, or AEs that led to study discontinuation. No treatment- or dose-related trends were observed in AEs, clinical laboratory results, vital sign measurements, 12-lead ECG and telemetry results. Conclusion: The above observations indicate that ONO-7746 could increase platelet count even with a single dose. ONO-7746 is a potent once-daily oral c-Mpl agonist with demonstrated thrombopoietic activity in human subjects, safe and well tolerated at all the tested dose levels (5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 150 mg).
