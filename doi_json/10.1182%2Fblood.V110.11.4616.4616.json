    "abstract_text": "Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a malignant disorder of hematopoietic progenitor cells and characterize by peripheral blood cytopenias with normo- to hyper-cellular bone marrow (BM) and morphologically dysplastic changes. Thrombocytopenia is observed in approximately 50% of MDS. The underlying pathophysiology is not fully understood. We analyzed the megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis state by several parameters, including % reticulated platelet (%RP), which indicated platelet production state, glycoalicine index (GCI), which indicated platelet destruction state, and serum thromopoietin (TPO) levels in 47 refractory anemia in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS-RCMD) patients with platelet counts less than 100 x 10 9 /L. Furthermore, apoptosis frequency of megakaryocyte progenitors was analyzed in several patients. In all patients, dysmegakaryocytopoiesis findings such as hypolobulated micromegakaryocyte, non-lobulated nuclei in all sizes, and multiple, widely-separated nuclei were observed. The megakaryocytes in BM was normal to decreased in number in 32 patients (70%). Plasma TPO levels were significantly higher (718.7\u00b1746.0 pg/ml, n=50) in MDS-RCMD, while they were less than 205.0 pg/ml in normal volunteers (68.3 \u00b165.3 pg/ml, n=32)(p< 0.01). The %RPs in MDS-RCMD and normal controls were similar (MDS-RCMD 1.7\u00b10.9% vs control 1.2\u00b10.6%), indicating that increased thrombocytopoiesis was not observed in MDS-RCMD, regardless of high TPO levels. GCI was similar to normal controls (MDS-RCMD, 1.5\u00b11.3% vs controls, 1.6\u00b10.3%), indicating no excess of platelet destruction. There was no correlation between %RP and GCI. These data strongly suggested that platelet life span be not shortend in MDS-RCMD. We have reported that excessive apoptosis of CD34(+) cells was observed in MDS patients in the previous ASH meetings. The three-color flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow mononuclear cells using PE labeled Annexin V, PerCP labeled anti-CD34 antibody and FITC labeled anti-CD41 antibody were carried out in 17 MDS-RCMD patients. Much higher frequency of apoptosis was observed in double positive cells for CD34 and CD41 (48.1%:13.4\u223c78.4%, median: range) in MDS-RCMD, compared to that in normal controls (7.7%: 4.4\u223c17.2%, median: range) (P<0.05). The frequency of apoptosis was not increased significantly in CD34(\u2212)CD41(+) cells in MDS-RCMD patients (median: 6.9% ; 1.3\u223c21.5%), n=12), compared to those in normal controls (3.3%: 1.5\u223c8.1%, n=10). These data strongly suggested that the main cause of thrombocytopenia in MDS-RCMD should be apoptosis in megakaryocytes progenitors, followed by the decreased megakaryocytopoiesis."
