    "abstract_text": "Copper ions appear important for the structural integrity and the function of factor VIII. Reconstitution studies have shown that Cu 2+ increases specific activity of factor VIII as well as increases affinity between heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC). Based on the ceruloplasmin homology, the existence of three Cu 2+ binding sites has been proposed. These include a type 1 site in HC (A1 domain) coordinated by C310, H315, H267, and M320, a type 1 site in LC (A3 domain) coordinated by C2000, H1954, H2005, and M2010, and type 2 site spanning A1 and A3 domains coordinated by H99 and H1957 with possible other additional residues. We rationalized that point mutations within a putative Cu 2+ coordination sites would diminish Cu 2+ binding at that site, as detected by changes in factor VIII specific activity and/or inter-subunit affinity. We produced several mutant factor VIII proteins bearing point mutation of C310S, H315A, C2000S, H1954A, H99A, or H1957A using a B-domainless human factor VIII vector. Each mutant was stably expressed and purified by SP-sepharose, which bound factor VIII primarily though LC. Western blotting indicated a reduction in the relative amount of HC in C310S and H99A factor VIII forms, suggesting that inter-chain affinity was reduced by these mutations. EDTA-treated factor VIII forms in the presence of Ca 2+ were titrated with Cu 2+ and activity was monitored using a factor Xa generation assay. The concentration of free Cu 2+ was controlled by the presence of EDTA and Ca 2+ based on the known values for Cu 2+ -EDTA and Ca 2+ -EDTA affinities. The activity regain observed for wild type factor VIII following titration with Cu 2+ yielded a Kd = 11.5 \u00b1 2.2 fM. All of the mutants tested retained a high affinity response to Cu 2+ , suggesting that single point mutations were not sufficient to eliminate Cu 2+ binding. However, while Kd values for H1957A (10.3 \u00b1 2.2 fM), H99A (2.1 \u00b1 1.9 fM), H315A (6.7 \u00b1 3.1 fM), and C310S (12.7 \u00b1 3.4 fM) retained similar or slightly reduced affinity for Cu 2+ , the Kd values for C2000S (304 \u00b1 105 fM) and H1954A (365 \u00b1 105 fM) showed a significant reduction in Cu 2+ affinity. When factor VIIIa subunits were titrated with Cu 2+ and monitored by intrinsic fluorescence, only purified A1 subunit showed a saturable effect of the signal (Kd = 11.9 \u00b1 4.9 fM), indicating that this subunit contained a high affinity Cu 2+ binding site. Taken together, these results suggest that occupancy of the type 1 Cu 2+ binding site in A3 contributes to the Cu 2+ -dependent increase in specific activity of factor VIII and that the type 1 site in A1 and/or the type 2 site contributes to HC-LC association.",
