    "abstract_text": "Natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity is reported to mediate strong graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect in patients after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. NKG2D receptors recognize human MHC class Ichain related A and B (MICA/B) and UL16-binding protein 1\u223c4(ULBP 1\u223c4) on target cells, thereby regulating NK cell activity. To examine the recovery of NKG2D, NKG2A and other receptors expression by NK cells, we used flow cytometry to evaluate samples from 11 chronic myeloid leukemia patients and their donors in the year following unmanipulated HLA completely matched peripheral blood stem cells plus bone marrow transplantation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients and their donors were tested in standard 51 Cr release assays against cultured K562 targets to determine the cytotoxicity of the NK cells in the same intervals. There is no mismatched immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) ligand in both GVH and HVG direction. The reconstitution of KIR2DL1 (CD158a) after this transplantation protocol was very slow and these receptors didn\u2019t reach normal value in the year and KIR2DL2 (CD158b) was much better. The NKG2D increased and the NKG2A decreased quickly at the same time after engraftment, and used linear regression analysis we demonstrated that NKG2A recovery was inversely correlated with NKG2D recovery in the year following transplantation. The ratio of NKG2D/NKG2A was directly associated with the capacity of NK-cell cytotoxicity. Thus, the reconstitution of NKG2D makes contribution to the recovery of the NK cytotoxicity. These results reveals that the NK cells generated after HLA matched blood plus bone morrow transplantation of CML patients are promoted at an immature state characterized by specific phenotypic features and enhanced functioning, having potential impact for immune responsiveness and transplantation outcome.",
