    "abstract_text": "Background: Outcomes of patients (pts) with Richter transformation (RT) remain dismal with a median survival of less than 1 year with chemoimmunotherapy (CIT). Dysfunction of T cells, NK cells and other immune subsets is common in pts with CLL. Checkpoint blockade is an emerging treatment approach for pts with RT (Ding et al. Blood 2017; Younes et al. ASH 2017). Methods: We designed an investigator-initiated phase II clinical trial combining nivolumab (anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody) with ibrutinib in pts with R/R CLL or RT (NCT02420912). We report data on the RT cohort. Nivolumab was given 3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks, starting cycle 1 day 1 for a total of 24 cycles. Ibrutinib was given 420 mg once daily starting cycle 2 day 1 (Ibrutinib could be added during cycle 1, in case of worsening disease) and continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. Each cycle was 4 weeks. Eligibility criteria included age \u226518 years, adequate organ function (total bilirubin \u22641.5 x ULN, ALT and AST \u22643 x ULN, creatinine \u22641.5 x ULN). Pts were included if they had received at least one therapy for CLL or RT (pts with del(17p) could be treatment-na\u00efve). Response assessments were done by PET scan and bone marrow after cycle 1, cycle 3, cycle 6, cycle 9, and cycle 12, cycle 18, and cycle 24. Results: A total of 23 pts with RT have been enrolled. The median age was 65 years (range, 49-88); 10 women, 13 men. The median number of prior therapies for CLL/RT was 3 (range, 0-10); one pt with previously untreated CLL who developed RT with del(17p) was enrolled. Prior therapies included CIT (n=18), ibrutinib (n=11), acalabrutinib (n=1), P13K inhibitor (n=4), venetoclax (n=3), allo-SCT (n=2). A total of 10 pts (43%) responded (complete metabolic response, n=8; partial metabolic response, n=2). The median duration of response (censored for allo-SCT) for the responding pts (n=10) is 9.3 months (Figure 1). Two pts previously treated with ibrutinib responded. A total of 4 pts underwent a subsequent allo-SCT after achieving a response to therapy. Four additional pts underwent allo-SCT after receiving a subsequent salvage therapy. The median overall survival for the entire group (n=23) is 13.8 months (Figure 1). One pt had G3 transaminitis and one pt had grade 4 lipase/amylase elevation. One pt developed grade 2 pneumonitis, and one pt had grade 2 uveitis. Correlative studies, including flow-cytometry and immunohistochemistry for PD1 and PDL1 are ongoing. Conclusions: The combination of nivolumab and ibrutinib has clinical activity in pts with RT with a 43% response rate.
