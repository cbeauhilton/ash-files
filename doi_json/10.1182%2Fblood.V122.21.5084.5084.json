    "abstract_text": "Background This study investigated the gene expression of TCR V\u03b2 subfamily T cells and clonality in peripheral blood from patients with DLBCL and discussed the relation between TCR VB subfamily and clinical characters, prognosis, T Cell Subgroup, et al. this study include 14 patients with DLBCL, to analyzed TCR V\u03b2clonality of their blood samples and to comprehend the CDR3 sequence. Methods The complementarity determining region 3(CDR3)of TCR V\u03b2 subfamily genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cels(PBMCs) from 14 DLBCL patients were amplified using RT-PCR, and the products of PCR were further analyzed by genescan technique for detection of the CDR3 size,to evaluate clonality of TCR V\u03b2 T cells. After that, analyzing the data with statistics software SPSS 17.0, to find out the relationshop between clonality of TCR V\u03b2(oligoclon, oligoclone trendenc, monoclonal bioclone or polyclon ) and laboratory features, immunophenotype, period, efficacy of chemotherapy, prognosis, et al. Result This study magnified samples and comprehensively analized characteristics of TCR V\u03b2 subfamily in patients with DLBCL patients, confirming the unbalance distribution and clonal expansion of TCR V\u03b2 subfamily. Several cases showed clonal proliferation in V\u03b23, V\u03b26, V\u03b27, V\u03b29, V\u03b214, V\u03b215 and V\u03b222, especially in V\u03b215 and V\u03b222.These clonal proliferation and deletion of V\u03b216, V\u03b218, V\u03b224 may be considered DLBCL related. Several TCR V\u03b2 subfamily appeared 3-polyclonal. Through number of clonal proliferation, gender, age, time since diagnosis, LDH, germinal center type or nongerminal center type, period, autologous transplantation or not, initial treatment / relapse of 14 cases were analized using two independent samples t-test. initial treatment / relapse was statistically significant (p = 0.027): number of clonal proliferation in patients with relapse-DLBCL compared to the number of untreated patients is high than patients with initial treatment. Pearson correlation analysis illustrated the number of clonal proliferation and ki-67 was negatively correlated, while CD3 + CD8 + lymphocytes showed a positive correlation. for the first time discriminant analysis was applied to gene scan results in the patients with DLBCL. Conclusion This study confirmed the unbalance distribution and clonal expansion of TCR V\u03b2 subfamily in patients with DLBCL. Further studies may pay attention to V\u03b215, V\u03b222 and 3-polyclonal which may relate to DLBCL. Several indicators of TCR V\u03b2 subfamily are closely linked with clinical data, that TCR V\u03b2 may be considered to use in clinical diagnosis and prognosis. It\u2019s the first time that Discriminant analysis was applied to gene scan results, so discriminant analysis may be considered to clinical application after perfecting.
