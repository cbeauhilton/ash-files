    "abstract_text": "We have investigated a child who presented with pre-B ALL and an acquired t(1;9)(p34;q34). BCR-ABL was not detected by RT-PCR or FISH analysis, however FISH did indicate that the ABL gene at 9q34 was disrupted. To identify the putative partner locus in this case, a modified 5\u2032RACE strategy was employed that selected against normal ABL transcripts. Several clones were recovered in which ABL was fused to SFPQ (also known as PSF), a gene mapping to 1p34 that encodes a polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing previously identified as a fusion partner of the helix-loop-helix transcription factor TFE3 in papillary renal cell carcinomas. Both SFPQ-ABL and reciprocal ABL-SFPQ transcripts were detectable by RT-PCR, and disruption of these two genes was further confirmed by amplification and sequencing of the forward genomic breakpoint. SFPQ-ABL, the likely oncogenic product, is predicted to encode a protein that retains the coiled coil domain of SFPQ and the entire tyrosine kinase domain and C-terminal sequences of ABL. The breakpoint in ABL was downstream of that seen for other ABL fusion genes and the chimeric protein is predicted to lack the ABL-encoded SH3 domain and part of the SH2 domain. The patient was treated according to the Children\u2019s Cancer Group Protocol 1961 and subsequently received augmented BFM therapy with doxorubicin and double delayed intensification. He achieved complete remission but suffered extramedullary testicular relapse at 4.5 years. Following orchiectomy and intensive chemotherapy he remains in complete remission more than 6 years after diagnosis. We conclude that SFPQ-ABL is a novel fusion gene associated with ALL. Although the patient here responded to conventional chemotherapy, SFPQ-ABL is likely to be sensitive to imatinib and use of this agent might be considered in further cases.",
