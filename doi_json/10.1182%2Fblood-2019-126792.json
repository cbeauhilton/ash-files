    "abstract_text": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by bone marrow failure and a propensity to progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A core component of the underlying pathogenesis in MDS is deregulation of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), which impact the function of immune cells and hence their capacity to mount anti-infective or anti-tumor responses. However, little is known about antigen-specific T cell function in patients with MDS. We hypothesized that virus-specific T cell (VST) function might be preserved in patients with MDS, and that the functional capacity of T cells reactive against tumor-associated antigens aberrantly overexpressed by clonal MDS cells such as Cyclin A1 (CCNA1) and Proteinase (PR3) might also be preserved and exploited for immunotherapeutic purposes. Following informed consent, we collected peripheral blood samples from 10 patients (pts) with MDS and 17 healthy donors. Most pts (9 out of 10) were transfusion dependent and 3 subsequently underwent an allogeneic HSCT. Table 1 summarizes the other clinical characteristics, karyotypic and mutational profile at the time of blood collection. Compared with T cells isolated from healthy donors, MDS patient-derived T cells had a similar CD4 to CD8 ratio (1.5-2.5:1 for healthy donors and 3:1 for MDS pts), but displayed a more exhausted profile at baseline (CD3+TIM3+: 1% in healthy donors and 5% in MDS pts) and produced higher levels of inflammatory cytokines [IFN\u03b3 (18\u00b13pg/ml vs 36\u00b116pg/ml, healthy donor vs MDS; p=0.12), and IL-8 (56\u00b132 vs 704\u00b1446 pg/ml, p=0.01)]. Next, to assess the capacity of MDS pts to mount ex vivo functional virus-directed responses, we stimulated patient-derived PBMCs (n=5) with overlapping peptide libraries (pepmixes) spanning immunogenic AdV, CMV, EBV, BK and HHV-6 antigens. Similar to healthy donor-derived T cell lines (n=5, 3 specific for 4 viruses and 2 for 5 viruses), all 5 MDS patient-derived lines demonstrated specificity for one or more of the target viruses (1 for 5 viruses, 1 for 4, 2 for 3 and 1 for 1 virus) as observed by IFN\u03b3 ELISpot assay with comparable magnitude (range Adv: 43-730 vs 384-941 in healthy donors, CMV: 0-1599 vs 0-3002, EBV: 0-1486 vs 0-541, BK: 0-839 vs 38-275 and HHV6: 0-794 vs 5-407 SFU/2x10 5 cells, respectively). We next examined the feasibility of expanding autologous MDS-antigen directed T cell products (n=10) to determine whether an adoptive immunotherapeutic approach might be applicable for MDS treatment. Thus, we exposed patient-derived PBMCs to autologous dendritic cells (DC) loaded with pepmixes spanning 6 MDS-associated antigens (CCNA1, survivin, WT1, PRAME, PR3 and NYESO1). After 3 rounds of stimulation, the products obtained were predominantly CD3+ T cells (mean 88\u00b11.3%) that were polyclonal (CD4: 46\u00b15% and CD8: 41\u00b14%) containing predominantly memory T cells (T EM: 36\u00b16% T CM : 37\u00b15% and T na\u00efve =13\u00b13%). Six lines (60%) showed specific recognition to at least one of the target antigens: 4 lines specific for PRAME, 1 for CCNA1, 1 for WT1 and 1 for NYESO1 (range 0-40, 0-184, 0-1386 and 0-179 SFU/2x10 5 cells, respectively by IFN\u03b3 ELIspot). T cell lines were capable of specifically secreting multiple effector cytokines in response to targets (TNF\u03b1: 12% and IFN\u03b3: 16% in response to PRAME in a representative patient-derived T cell line). Furthermore, this line was capable of killing PRAME+ targets in a 4hr 51 Cr release assay [60% specific lysis, E:T 20:1]. In conclusion, functional virus-directed T cell immunity in patients with MDS is preserved, potentially explaining the lower rates of viral reactivation seen in these patients compared with other infections. Moreover, T cells specific for MDS-expressed tumor antigens can also be successfully expanded ex vivo from patients. Taken together this raises the possibility of applying an adoptive immunotherapeutic approach for the treatment of MDS.
