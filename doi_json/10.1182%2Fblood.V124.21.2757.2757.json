    "abstract_text": "Background : Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a common drug reaction that causes arterial or venous thrombosis as a result of heparin therapy. Platelet-activating antibodies, against complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin, cause intense platelet activation, ultimately leading to an increased risk of thrombosis, limb-loss and even death. Most patients exposed to heparin will produce non-pathogenic anti-PF4/heparin antibodies while only a small number will produce platelet-activating and HIT-causing antibodies (pathogenic HIT antibodies). Among HIT tests, the functional assays, such as the serotonin release assay (SRA), correlate best with the disease because they can specifically identify the pathogenic HIT antibodies whereas the enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) cannot. We have previously shown that anti-PF4/heparin antibody production precedes thrombocytopenia in HIT patients ( Warkentin et al., Blood 2009 113: 4963-4969 ) possibly indicating the need for a threshold plasma level of pathogenic HIT antibody, among other factors, to cause the disease. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of low levels of pathogenic HIT antibodies in samples from patients suspected of HIT who had detectable anti-PF4/heparin antibodies in the EIA (EIA-positive), but who did not have platelet-activating antibodies in the standard SRA (SRA-negative). Methods : We used an in-house IgG-specific EIA to detect the presence of anti-PF4/heparin antibodies (EIA-positive: OD 405nm > 0.45) and the standard SRA to detect the presence of heparin-dependent platelet-activating antibodies (SRA-positive: release >20% with 0.1-0.3 IU/mL of unfractionated heparin). We developed an enhanced SRA (eSRA) by adding increasing concentrations of exogenous PF4 (0-100 \u03bcg/mL) to detect sub-threshold levels of platelet activating antibodies undetectable in the standard SRA (eSRA-positive: release >20%). Samples tested were referred for HIT testing by the McMaster Platelet Immunology Laboratory (Hamilton, Canada). Results : Sera from healthy individuals (n=10) and from suspected HIT patients with a negative anti-PF4/heparin EIA (n=15) did not demonstrate platelet activation in the eSRA at any dose of exogenous PF4 added. SRA-positive sera (n = 7), diluted sufficiently that they were non-reactive in the standard SRA, demonstrated PF4 dose-dependent platelet activation in the eSRA. This confirmed the increased sensitivity of the eSRA in detecting low-titre platelet-activating antibodies. Reactivity in the eSRA was inhibited by high heparin (100 U/mL) and by blocking the platelet FcgRIIa receptor with the monoclonal antibody IV.3. We then tested samples (n=24) referred for HIT testing that were positive in the anti-PF4/heparin EIA (optical densities OD 405nm 0.7 to 2.4) but negative in the standard SRA. Heparin-dependent platelet activation (20-99% release) was demonstrated in 11 of 24 (46%) in the eSRA. This reactivity directly correlated with the amount of PF4 added to the platelets (optimal concentration of PF4 12.5 - 100 \u03bcg/mL) but not with the strength (OD 405nm ) of the anti-PF4/heparin EIA. In further investigations, we concentrated (4-fold) 7 of the 11 eSRA-positive samples in an attempt to increase the concentration of the antibodies. Of those 7 samples, 5 (71%) became positive in the standard SRA upon testing of the concentrated sample. Conclusions : These data indicate that low-titre platelet-activating antibodies may be found in some patients suspected of having HIT that test negative in the standard SRA irrespective of the strength (OD 405nm ) of the anti-PF4/heparin EIA. The immune response during heparin therapy can produce both families of pathogenic and non-pathogenic anti-PF4/heparin antibodies but it is the titre of the pathogenic antibody that may be necessary for platelet activation. Perhaps under permissive clinical conditions and with patient-specific factors, the titre of the pathogenic HIT antibodies may increase and lead to HIT.
