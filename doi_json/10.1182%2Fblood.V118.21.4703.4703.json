    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4703 Background: Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a common late complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Corticosteroids are the standard initial treatment for cGVHD. A second-line treatment is not well defined. We prospectively evaluated the effectiveness and safety of low doses of alemtuzumab and low doses of rituximab as treatment steroid-refractory cGVHD. Materials and Methods: Ten men and 5 women with cGVHD refractory to steroids and CSA were included. All patients received subcutaneous Alemtuzumab 10 mg/day/3 days and intravenous Rituximab 100 mg on days +1, +7, +14 and +21. Results: The median age was 41 years. The main organ involved were oral mucosa (86.7%), eyes (66.7%), liver (60%), skin (53%), lungs (13.3%) and intestinal tract (6.7%). The overall response was 100% at 30-day evaluation; 10 patients (67%) had partial remission (PR), and 5 patients (33%) had complete remission (CR). At 90-day evaluation, 7 (50%) patients had PR, 4 (28%) had CR; three (21%) relapsed and 1 patient not reached evaluation. Currently, 5 patients have reached the 365-day follow-up evaluation, 2 (40%) had PR, 2 had CR and 1 showed progression. The adverse effects were mainly infectious and one patient died from pneumonia. Conclusion: This combination therapy appears to be an efficacious and safe as treatment for steroid-refractory cGVHD. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
