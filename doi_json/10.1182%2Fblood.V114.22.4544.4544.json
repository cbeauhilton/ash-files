Recently, a new FDA-cleared battery powered bone marrow biopsy system was developed to allow operators access to the bone marrow space quickly and efficiently. Aims The first aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of core specimens using the new powered device compared to specimens obtained using the traditional manual technique in a swine model. The second aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the device in patients presenting for outpatient hematology clinic visits. Materials and Methods For the pre-clinical evaluation of the device, three anesthetized pigs were used for the study. The powered device (OnControl, Vidacare Corporation, San Antonio, TX, USA) was comprised of a battery powered driver and needle set. The manual device used was a T-Handle Jamshidi bone marrow biopsy needle (Cardinal Health, Dublin, OH, USA). Core biopsy samples obtained were assessed for length and sample quality and then submitted for analysis to a pathologist blinded to the device used. The clinical evaluation of the device was conducted in accordance with practice guidelines and directions for use. Data collection included insertion success, time from insertion to removal, specimen quality, operator satisfaction with control/function of the device and overall operator satisfaction based on a scoring system (0-5; 0=totally unacceptable, 5=outstanding). Results Twenty six samples were collected from the swine model (19 samples using the powered device and 9 using the manual technique). No cellular artifact or thermal damage was reported in any of the samples obtained. The mean lengths for samples obtained using the powered and manual techniques were respectively 19.4mm\u00b11.6mm and 18.6mm\u00b15.3mm. For the clinical evaluation of the device, 16 patients were recruited from 2 centers. Mean insertion time was 11.25\u00b13.39 seconds and mean time from needle contact with skin to needle removal was 38.5\u00b113.94 seconds. No complications were reported. Five operators rated the overall use of the device as outstanding in 75% of cases. Conclusions In this study, the manual and powered samples were equivalent in specimen quality. The powered device however, captured longer biopsies when compared to the manual technique. In the patients evaluated, the device was easy to use as well as being safe and effective. The mean procedural time was significantly faster than previously reported with a manual technique. A randomized study of the powered device compared to the manual technique is underway.
