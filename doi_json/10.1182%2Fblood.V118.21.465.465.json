    "abstract_text": "Abstract 465 CLL is among the most heritable of all cancers. To understand the genetic basis of this heritability, we have undertaken a comprehensive genomic analysis of familial CLLs including copy number analysis, gene expression profiling (GEP) and whole exome sequencing (WES). First, we examined whether familial and sporadic cases differ in the spectrum of acquired somatic mutations by WES of tumor and germline DNA of 36 familial CLLs (from 31 affected families). Compared to 55 sporadic CLLs, we observed that the somatic mutation rate in the familial CLLs was similar (mean 0.89 mutations/Mb (range 0.29\u20133.06) for the sporadics vs mean 0.97/Mb (range 0.11\u20133.78) for the familials, p=0.40). We also examined the spectrum of somatic mutations by testing for enrichment of 9 recently identified putative tumor drivers in our large CLL sequencing study (reported elsewhere in this meeting). We observed a similar distribution of these recurrent CLL mutations among the 36 familial CLLs as the 55 sporadic CLLs. These results were further confirmed by genotyping of the CLL driver mutations in an additional 32 familial and 67 sporadic CLLs. Collectively, these studies suggest that while the predisposing germline events may differ between familial and sporadic CLL, the spectrum of mutations and pattern of mutagenesis appear similar in the established CLL tumors. We therefore proceeded to examine the genetic characterization of germline DNA to identify predisposing loci, which we hypothesized might be enriched in a familial disease context. We first examined germline copy number variations (CNVs), which have not been previously characterized in this disease. We used high resolution Affymetrix 6.0 SNP arrays to study both tumor and germline DNA of 58 individuals representing 44 different families with CLL and lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs). We identified two families (A and B) with autosomal dominant inheritance of CLL who carried distinct germline CNVs that affect genes previously implicated in CLL. Members of Family A carried a 525 kb germline deletion targeting DLEU7 at 13q14, but not affecting DLEU2 , miR-15a, or miR-16\u20131. Importantly, by examining the tumor genome from these family members, we observed a uniform loss of the second allele of DLEU7 in 2/2 available CLLs from this family, suggesting an acquired \u201csecond hit\u201d of a tumor suppressor gene. These findings underline the complexity of the most common somatically acquired copy number aberration (CNA) in CLL, 13q14 deletion, by demonstrating the role of additional regions other than the heavily investigated miRNA cluster. Members of Family B carried a 720 kb germline gain of 6p25 affecting the IRF4 gene, previously implicated in CLL through the identification of a GWAS risk allele located in the 3' UTR of IRF4 , as well as the recent description of a recurrent somatic mutation affecting 1.5% of CLL cases. In Family B, the coding regions of the four genes located in this 6p gain, namely IRF4 , DUSP22 , EXOC2 and HUS1B , were sequenced, and no somatic mutations or novel SNPs were identified. However, the 6p gain in Family B represents an allele-specific enrichment of the haplotype carrying the GWAS risk SNP and, as previously described for that allele, results in lower expression of IRF4 in the two CLLs tested in this family. GEP further identified a signature associated with 6p gain that preserved low expression of IRF4 and showed high expression of KLF6 . These results demonstrate that germline CNVs may facilitate the \u201cpath to cancer\u201d by providing either an allelic deletion of a tumor suppressor or an amplification of a risk allele. As most familial CLL cases have not been accounted for by known SNPs or germline CNVs, we have initiated an in depth analysis of the WES germline results from familial cases compared to both sporadic CLL patients and normal individuals. Candidate variants have been filtered to exclude all SNPs described in the 1000 Genomes project and to focus on highly conserved sites. Thus far we have found that rare germline variants in patients with familial CLL contain a rich source of loci with relevance to B cell biology. Studies in progress are focused on further analysis of informative families and functional analyses of candidate variants. These comprehensive genomic analyses are expected to identify multiple cooperating genetic mechanisms that contribute to CLL pathogenesis, including CNVs and somatic and germline mutations.
