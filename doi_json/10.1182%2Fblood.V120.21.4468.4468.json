    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4468 Introduction Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or non responsive myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who fail to achieve a complete remission, have unfavorable cytogenetics or are refractory to therapy have a poor prognosis. Allogeneic HSCT is frequently considered a salvage option for these patients although remissions are short-lived. New strategies are needed for maintaining remission in this extremely high risk patient group. We hypothesized hypomethylating agents post allogeneic HSCT would enable patients to remain in complete remission. Methods Eleven patients were treated. Patient characteristics: median age, 48 years (range, 18\u201370 years), PBSC (n=9) or bone marrow (n=2); Diagnoses AML= 10, Non- responsive MDS=1, CIBMTR disease risk category: High [n=8], Intermediate [n=1], Low [n=2]; 36% of the patients had primary induction failure, 54% had complex molecular abnormalities with 18% of the patients having deletion 11q 23 molecular abnormality. Donors were unrelated (36%) and related (64%). All but 1 donor-recipient pairs were fully matched. Preparative regimen- busulfan based (16mg/kg or equivalent) (82%), TBI \u2265 12 Gy (9%) based or reduced-intensity haplo-identical regimen (9%). The median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 2.5 (range, 2\u20136). Azacitidine (n=10) or decitabine (n=1) was selected at physician discretion as a planned prophylactic regimen post allogeneic HSCT engraftment. Initial starting doses were based on hematological conditions at the time of therapy initiation. Results Ten patients received azacitidine subcutaneously daily for seven days for a median of 5 cycles (range, 1\u201310 cycles) and one patient received decitabine 20mg/m 2 intravenously for 5 days for 3 cycles. Median initial Azacitidine dose of 50 mg/m 2 (range, 25\u201375mg/m 2 ) daily were given at a median of 40 days (range, 38\u2013101 days) post HSCT engraftment. Azacitidine doses were increased based on counts to a maximum dose of 75mg/m 2 . With a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 1.7\u201349 months) 6 patients are alive in complete remission. Twenty-four month progression free survival is 51% with overall survival of 76%. Conclusion Given the dismal results of progression free survival and overall survival following allogeneic HSCT in high risk AML or non responsive MDS, hypomethylating agents given post transplantation provide a valuable approach to prolonging remission.
