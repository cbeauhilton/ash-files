    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1652 Background: Activation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway contributes to mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) pathogenesis, but early phase studies of the p110\u03b4 selective inhibitor GS-1101 demonstrate inferior responses in MCL compared to CLL and indolent NHL. The relative importance of the class Ia PI3K isoforms - p110\u03b1, p110\u03b2 and p110\u03b4 in MCL is not clear. While p110\u03b4 is enriched in leucocytes, p110\u03b1 gene amplification has been reported in 68% of MCL. Loss of PTEN expression occurs in approximately 15% of MCL and evidence in solid tumors suggests an essential role for p110\u03b2 in PI3K signaling associated with PTEN loss. We previously reported significant up-regulation of p110\u03b1 expression in relapsed disease as well as significantly greater in vitro cytotoxicity with GDC0941, a predominantly p110\u03b1/\u03b4 inhibitor, compared to the p110\u03b4 selective inhibitor GS-1101 in MCL. To investigate this further, we used isoform selective inhibitors to study the relative contribution of class Ia isoforms to PI3K signaling in the context of B-cell receptor (BCR) activation, p110\u03b1 over-expression and PTEN deletion in this disease. We also screened tumor cells for activating mutations in PIK3CA and PIK3R1 , the genes encoding p110\u03b1 and p85\u03b1 respectively. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and lymph nodes from MCL patients were used in addition to two MCL cell lines Jeko1 and Granta519. Goat anti-human IgM f(a'b) fragments were used for BCR stimulation. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting were used to assess PTEN expression. In addition to GDC0941 and GS-1101, A66 was used for p110\u03b1-selective inhibition and TGX-221 for p110\u03b2 inhibition. GS-1101 was purchased from Active Biochem and all other inhibitors from Selleck Chem. Changes in downstream targets of PI3K (p-Akt t308, p-Akt s473 and p-S6 s235/236) were evaluated using western blotting. DNA was extracted from 10 primary samples and 2 cell lines. Exons 9, 10, 11, 13, 15 and 16 of PIK3R1 and exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA , were sequenced and screened for activating mutations. Results: p110\u03b4 is expressed at high levels in MCL and p110\u03b4 selective inhibition with GS-1101 was sufficient to block BCR-stimulated activation of the PI3K pathway in MCL cells. In order to investigate the relevance of increased p110\u03b1 in relapsed MCL, that we previously reported, we treated the Granta519 MCL cell line, which exhibits p110\u03b1 gene amplification and constitutive Akt phosphorylation, with GS-1101 and GDC0941. In GS-1101 treated cells, phosphorylation of Akt was still detectable at low levels after 2 hours of treatment while p-Akt was undetectable in cells treated with equimolar concentrations (1\u03bcM) of GDC0941. At 24 hours, GS-1101 treated cells showed an increase in Akt phosphorylation compared to 2 hour levels suggesting ongoing p110\u03b1 mediated signaling despite p110\u03b4 inhibition, whereas p-Akt remained undetectable in GDC-0941 treated cells. These changes were reflected in downstream phosphorylation of ribosomal S6. The addition of the highly selective p110\u03b2 inhibitor TGX221 to GS-1101 did not have any additional effect on p-Akt whereas adding a p110\u03b1 selective inhibitor (A66) mimicked the activity of GDC0941, further supporting the role of p110\u03b1 in p110\u03b4-independent PI3K signaling. We found loss of PTEN expression in 17% (25/147) of MCL biopsies by IHC. There was no change in the pattern of class Ia isoform expression in tumors with loss of PTEN and adding a p110\u03b2 inhibitor to GS-1101 did not increase cytotoxicity in MCL primaries that had loss of PTEN expression. No activating PIK3CA or PIK3R1 mutations were detected in 10 primary MCL samples and 2 cell lines. Conclusion: In healthy B-cells, p110\u03b4 is essential for BCR mediated PI3K signaling but both p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b4 contribute to tonic PI3K signaling. Our studies confirm a similar essential role for p110\u03b4 in MCL cells both by its expression and its role in BCR signaling. However, over-expression of p110\u03b1 in MCL, especially in relapsed disease, increases the contribution of this isoform to tonic PI3K signaling thereby limiting the efficacy of p110\u03b4-selective inhibition. The increased expression of p110\u03b1 with relapse may reflect reduced dependence of tumor cells on survival signals from their microenvironment. We conclude that whereas PI3K p110\u03b2 does not appear to play a significant role in MCL, inhibition of both p110\u03b1 and \u03b4 isoforms appears essential for effective PI3K inhibition in this disease.
