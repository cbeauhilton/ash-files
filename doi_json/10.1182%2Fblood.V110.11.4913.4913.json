    "abstract_text": "High-Dose myeloablative therapy in conjunction with Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (APBSC) transplantation is an effective first line treatment in patients with haematological malignancies including Multiple Myeloma (MM) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). With sufficient resources, APBSC\u2019s can be harvested in patients during remission or consolidation treatment for subsequent transplantation if required (\u2018Rainy Day\u2019 Collection). We investigated the eventual transplantation of \u2018Rainy Day\u2019 collections at our centre to assess the utilization of this strategy. We defined \u2018Rainy Day\u2019 collections as those that were not intended to be used as part of initial therapy and in general, patients were not planned to be transplanted within the 12 months following harvest. For collections that were transplanted within 12 months following harvest, \u2018Rainy Day\u2019 collections were differentiated based on the utilization intent at time of collection. Any collections infused within 3 months following harvest were excluded from the analysis. Over a 6 year period, we collected APBSC\u2019s from 365 patients with the intent of \u2018Rainy Day\u2019 storage. Primary disease indications included NHL (45%, n=166), MM (12%, n=44), Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) (8%, n=29) and Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) (7%, n=25). To date, 23% (n=84) of these \u2018Rainy Day\u2019 collections have been subsequently infused. NHL has been the most common disease requiring Rainy Day collections and has resulted in 41 subsequent transplants (24% utilization) with a median time between collection and infusion of 1.74 years (SD =1.60). Mean days until platelets > 20x10 9 /L=15 (SD=7.0) and days until ANC > 0.5x10 6 /L=10 (SD=1.7). Follicular Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (fNHL) has accounted for the majority of NHL transplants (37%, 5/15), with 5 of 15 patients exhibiting transformation of fNHL into Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma and an average time between collection and infusion of 2.07 years (SD 2.01). Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (T-NHL) has contributed to 15% (n=6/41) of transplanted NHL \u2018Rainy Day\u2019 collections with a mean time between collection and infusion being shorter at 1.53 years (SD=0.97). 23% of MM patients (n=44/202) have had APBSC\u2019s collected for potential \u2018Rainy Day\u2019 utilization compared with 53% of NHL (n=166/309), 86% of AML (n=29/34) and 100% of CML (25/25). MM has shown to have the highest \u2018Rainy Day\u2019 APBSC utilisation with 55% (n=23/44) of patients resulting in transplantation. The average time between collection and infusion has been 2.79 years (SD=1.65) with mean days until platelets > 20x10 9 /L=14 (SD =6.9) and days until ANC > 0.5x10 6 /L=10 (SD=1.7). We conclude that it is clinically feasible and safe to perform \u2018Rainy Day\u2019 collections although more stringent criteria would result in a more efficient use of this resource intensive strategy.",
