    "abstract_text": "Pediatric idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a bleeding disorder characterized by immune-mediated platelet destruction. Current evidence suggests that childhood ITP is associated with an imbalance within the T cell regulatory network following an external immune trigger resulting in an excessive or sustained proinflammatory T helper cytokine response. In order to understand why certain children are at risk for sustained thrombocytopenia or chronic ITP, we investigated cytokine responses to peptides from a common platelet membrane autoantigen, glycoprotein (GP) Ib, and the relationship to the genotype frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genes associated with immune regulation. Methods: PBMC and DNA were collected from 114 children with ITP, (80 acute, 34 chronic) and 25 controls. PBMC were stimulated with Phytohemaglutinin-P (PHA) or GP Ib peptides and the resulting Interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3), Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), and Interleukin 4 (IL-4) cytokine production was measured by ELISA. DNA was isolated and genotypes determined for inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b1 (\u2212889), Fc\u03b3 receptor Fc\u03b3RIIIA (F158V), and Complement C1qc (exon 1, codon 42). Results: Previously, we have shown a large shift in the allele frequencies of the Fc\u03b3RIIIA receptor SNP (F158V) in ITP patients (F=.36, V=.64 vs F=.70, V=.30; p<0.001) and IL-1\u03b1 \u2212889 SNP (C=.67, T=.33 vs C=.84, T=.16; p=0.005) compared to controls. Data from the current analysis is shown in table below. ITP patients produce significantly less IL-4 (54%; p=0.0001) and IL-1\u03b2 (80%; p=0.0041) than controls when stimulated with the mitogen PHA. Conversely, when stimulated with GP Ib peptides, ITP patients produce more IFN\u03b3 (252%; p=0.0272) than controls. In particular, ITP patients with genotype Fc\u03b3RIIIA V/V, or IL-1\u03b1 C/C, or C1qc C/T produce more IFN\u03b3 than controls when stimulated with autoantigenic peptides. In addition to increased IFN\u03b3 production, only ITP patients with Fc\u03b3RIIIA V/V genotype produce significantly more IL-1\u03b2 and IL-4 than controls. These same patients were shown to have 100% response rate to IVIG in a previous report. Differential Cytokine Production from ITP Patients\u2019 PBMC Compared to Controls  Cytokine Comparison . PHA .

This polarization of ITP patients towards a proinflammatory immune response may result in sustained stimulation of antigen primed B cells leading to platelet destruction. In addition, to fully understand the etiology of childhood ITP, robust statistical analysis of cytokine abnormalities should be performed in the context of immune receptor polymorphisms, as these genetic differences appear to modulate the impact of the proinflammatory trigger in these patients.",
