    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4828 Objective This study was aimed to investigate the reversible effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors(TKI)on Multidrug resistance cell line K562/A02. Methods The expression levels of mdr-1 mRNA and bcr-abl mRNA were assayed by RT-PCR. The protein levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and P 210 were detected by Western blot. The DNR accumulation of K562/A02 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). Results Analysis of the inhibition rate showed that 0.0625\u03bcmol/L Imatinib or 5nM Nilotinib alone had no effect on the inhibition of K562/A02 cells. The fluorescence intensity of intracellular DNR of Imatinib, Nilotinib in K562/A02 cells was 7.85%, 12.02% (respectively of that in K562 cells). Imatinib or Nilotonib alone could decrease the mdr-1 mRNA and bcr-abl mRNA expression levels (Imatinib 0.65\u00b10.02, 0.87\u00b10.02; Nilotinib 0.48\u00b10.04, 0.73 \u00b10.02) respectively, all these of which were significantly lower than the K562/A02 cells group 0.96\u00b10.01, 1.87\u00b10.04. The P-gp and P 210 protein expression levels were also down after treated with different drugs (Imatinib 0.74\u00b10.02, 0.68\u00b10.01; Nilotinib 0.61\u00b10.05, 0.60\u00b10.01; the K562/A02 cells group 0.93\u00b10.01, 1.25\u00b10.03). Conclusion It is concluded that multidrug resistance (MDR) can be partially reversed by Imatinib or Nilotinib. The effect of Nilotinib was greater than Imatinib.
