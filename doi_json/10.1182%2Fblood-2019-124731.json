    "abstract_text": "Background: APC has been suggested to contribute to a hyperfibrinolytic state in various acquired coagulation disorders, including coagulopathies induced by trauma and sepsis. However, in vivo evidence for the proposed underlying mechanism of proteolytic degradation of PAI-1 by APC remains inconclusive. Recently, we have shown increased APC generation in response to in vivo thrombin formation in carriers of the factor V Leiden mutation (FVL). In this approach of stimulated hemostasis activity pattern evaluation (SHAPE), in vivo thrombin formation was triggered by low-dose administration of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa). Aim of the present study was to investigate the resulting effects on the fibrinolytic system. Methods: The study population consisted of 30 FVL carriers (thereof 13 with a history of venous thromboembolism) and 15 healthy controls. Blood samples were collected immediately before and during a period of 8 hours following injection of 15 \u00b5g/kg rFVIIa. Plasma levels of APC were quantified using an oligonucleotide-based enzyme capture assay (OECA). Other monitored parameters included plasma levels of prothrombin activation fragment 1+2 (F1+2), tissue-type plasminogen (t-PA), PAI-1, plasminogen, \u03b12-antiplasmin, plasmin-\u03b12-antiplasmin complexes (PAP), soluble fibrin monomers, d-dimer, and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). Results: At baseline, FVL carriers showed higher median levels of APC in comparison to the controls (1.39 vs. 0.86 pmol/L, P =.001), higher PAI-1 levels (30.1 vs. 15.3 ng/mL, P =.002) and lower plasminogen levels (94.8 vs. 110.4%, P =6\u00b710 -4 ). The other baseline parameters did not differ significantly. In both cohorts a comparable increase of F1+2 was observed after administration of rFVIIa, whereas APC increased more ( P =.004) in FVL carriers (by 6.40 pmol/L) than in healthy controls (by 2.14 pmol/L), Concurrently, median PAI-1 levels decreased more ( P =.007) in FVL carriers (by 19.8 pmol/L) than in healthy controls (by 8.0 pmol/L) ( Figure 1 ). TAFI levels decreased temporarily, from 104.8 to 94.4% ( P =.007) in FVL carriers and from 105.0 to 92.1% ( P =2\u00b710 -4 ) in healthy controls. PAP levels increased from 164 to 209 ng/mL ( P <10 -4 ) in FVL carriers and from 154 to 189 ng/mL ( P =.023) in the control group. The extent of these changes did not differ between the two cohorts. D-dimer level increased only in FVL carriers, from 0.34 to 0.41 mg/L ( P =.008). t-PA and the other parameters did not show significant changes after rFVIIa administration. Conclusion: Increased APC formation rates in FVL carriers were associated with a greater decline of PAI-1 levels in the absence of interfering changes in t-PA levels. These data provide further in vivo evidence that APC down-regulates PAI-1. Overall, the SHAPE approach utilized here does not induce a significant profibrinolytic response, even in patients with thrombophilia.
