    "abstract_text": "Introduction Progress has been made in diagnosis and treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma who receive their treatment within prospective clinical trials. Due to necessary inclusion and exclusion criteria only a very limited number of patients are treated in studies. Therefore results from clinical trials can't be transferred into routine care. Little practice data are available how patients with follicular lymphoma are diagnosed and treated in routine care and whether improvements in survival are achieved. Methods A retrospective analysis of all patients with follicular lymphoma who were treated in an oncology group practice in Germany between 1995-2012. Relevant clinical data concerning diagnosis, treatment and survival were transferred from clinical files into a database and analyzed statistically using SPSS and SURVSOFT. Results 174 patients with a median age of 60 (27-87) were identified. 43.7% were male and 56.3% female. Stage distribution at initial diagnosis was as follows: Stage I 45 patients (25.9%), stage II 23 patients (13.2%), stage III 32 patients (18.4%), stage IV 62 patients (35.6%), in 12 patients (6.9%) initial stage could not be retrieved. 90.8% needed therapy with a median of 2 different therapies (1-12). Regimens most frequently applied were: Rituximab-containing (67.1%), Bendamustine-containig (41.8%), Bendamustine+Rituximab-combinations (39.9%) and R-CHOP (27.8%). 15 patients (9.5%) received radiotherapy only. 13.3% of patients were treated within a clinical trial. 5 and 10 year absolute overall survival was 88.9% and 73.9%. Relative survival after 5 and 10 years was 94.4% and 86.6%. Median overall survival according to stage was 28 years for stage I, median not reached for stage II, 21 years for stage III and 16 years for stage IV. Median relative survival was 17.4 years for stage IV and has not been reached for stages I-III. Conclusions Systemic treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma in routine care consisted mainly of Bendamustine+Rituximab-combinations and R-CHOP. Employment of the most active chemoimmunotherapies leads to a marked prolongation of survival compared to historical controls and registry data.
