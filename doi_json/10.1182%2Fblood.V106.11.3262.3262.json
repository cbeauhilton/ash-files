    "abstract_text": "Assessment of MRD in APL by Q-PCR analysis for the presence or absence of PML-RAR\u03b1 mRNA after the completion of consolidation therapy in treatment regimens employing all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy (CT) has provided a reasonably accurate but not infallible prognostic test for disease recurrence (DR). This assessment has been made at detection sensitivity levels up to 1 in 10 4 , which is considered to have optimal predictive value, since non-quantified lower levels of PML-RAR\u03b1 mRNA may not be relevant to clinical outcome. In the current study, we compared the results of Q-PCR (touchdown PCR for 40 cycles followed by post-PCR blot hybridization with a RAR\u03b1 chemiluminescent probe) to results from RQ-PCR in 15 patients on a Phase II clinical trial designed to eliminate CT (low-risk/LR patients, WBC 10K), using combined ATRA and arsenic trioxide therapy. All patients achieved complete remission (CR) and have been followed for a median of 1.2 years. DR occurred in 0/8 LR, 0/1 unclassified and 2/6 HR patients. At CR, all Q-PCR and RQ-PCR assays were positive. For RQ-PCR, the normalized quotient (NQ) value of PML-RAR\u03b1, i.e., the PML-RAR\u03b1 copy number divided by the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3\u2032-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) copy number, ranged widely from 1.5 x 10 \u22126 to 7.0 x 10 \u22123 . Post-CR follow-up data were:  Patient Group . Number . Q-PCR+ . RQ-PCR+ . NQ Range .

In overall comparisons to RQ-PCR results, all Q-PCR assays were positive for NQ >10 \u22125 , 3/4 were positive in the NQ 10 \u22126 to 10 \u22125 range, and all were negative for NQ <10 \u22126 . Additionally, dilution-reconstruction experiments confirmed the stochastic nature of PCR assays near the detection limit and indicated that RQ-PCR was about 10-fold more sensitive than Q-PCR. Although larger studies are needed, our results suggest that HR patients who are Q-PCR-negative but RQ-PCR-positive in the >10 \u22127 \u2013 <10 \u22125 range at a critical post-CR checkpoint may be at increased risk of DR and, more generally, they suggest that the results of RQ-PCR testing at a critical checkpoint can be used in combination with clinical risk assessment to stratify the intensity of subsequent MRD monitoring in individual patients.",
