    "abstract_text": "This study investigated Thiotepa (TT) and Fludarabine (Fluda) as a preparative regimen for allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute leukemia from MDS (MDS-AML) older than 50 or with comorbidities contraindicating standard conditioning. Patients were prepared with TT, given over 3 hours as an i.v. infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg over two days (day -8 and day -7) and Fluda at the dose of 125 mg/m 2 i.v. over five days ( from day -7 to day -3). Fresh or cryopreserved allogeneic peripheral stem cells were infused on day 0 or +1. Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A (CyA) at the dose of 1.5 mg/kg day as a continuous iv infusion from day -5 until engraftment. The CyA was then administered orally at the dose of 3 mg/kg twice a day. Doses were adjusted to maintain plasma level concentrations between 150\u2013350 mg/dL. From day +60, in the absence of acute GvHD, the CyA was tapered down by 20% every 2 weeks until withdrawal. In addition, patients received methotrexate 10 mg/m 2 on day +1, and 8 mg/m 2 on days + 3, +6 and +11 after transplantation. At the time of transplantation, patients were classified in two risk groups (low vs high risk) according to IPSS score (low/intermediate-1 vs. intermediate-2/high) for MDS patients, and disease status (CR vs. not CR) for MDS-AML. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was carried out to compare Overall Survival (OS), Transplant-Related Mortality (TRM) and probability of relapse. Fifty patients (29 males, 21 females) entered the study; the median age was 54 years (range 38\u201371). Sixteen MDS patients had a low/intermediate 1 score according to the International Prognostic Score System (IPSS), 16 had an intermediate 2/high IPSS score, 18 had MDS-AML. Thirty patients underwent transplantation as front-line therapy, 20 received one or more cycles of chemotherapy before transplant. Among the latter, nine with MDS-AML were in complete remission at the time of their transplant, while four were in a partial remission. The interval from diagnosis to transplantation ranged from 1 to 52 months (median value 11 months). Contraindications to a standard conditioning regimen were liver disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy secondary to hypertension or valvular stenosis, cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, previous CNS bleeding, and a history of sepsis. All but one patient achieved engraftment, with full donor chimerism by day +30. Patients were followed up for a median time of 21 months (range 0.2\u201387). TRM at 1 and 2 years after transplantation was 25% and 33%; the 5-year probability of relapse was 27%. Twenty-six patients are alive in complete remission, and the 5-year OS is 50%. The 5-year OS was 73% and 28% in low- and high-risk patients respectively (p=0.002). TRM at 1 and 2 years after transplantation was 13% and 21% in the low-risk group and 39% and 45% in the high-risk group (p=0.046); the 5-year probability of relapse was 10% and 50% in the low- and high-risk group respectively (p=0.015). In a multivariate Cox regression, risk group retained a borderline significance (HR=2.6, p=0.07) when adjusted by age at transplantation (p=0.03) and interval from diagnosis to transplant (n.s.). The combination of Thiotepa and Fludarabine is an effective and well-tolerated conditioning regimen in patients with MDS or MDS-AML who are poor candidates for standard myeloablative transplantation, particularly in MDS patients with low/intermediate-1 IPSS score and MDS-AML patients in CR.",
