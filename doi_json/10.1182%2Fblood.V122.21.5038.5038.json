    "abstract_text": "Multidrug resistance in cancer and adverse effects of chemotherapy are the major obstacles for cancer therapeutics. This study was aimed to investigate the efficiency of novel multifunctional Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles combined with chemotherapeutic agents and hyperthermia in order to reverse multidrug resistance and reduce side effects by concentrating chemotherapeutics on the target site in vivo leukemia models. K562 and K562/A02 xenograft tumor-bearing nude mice were randomly divided into 4 groups, a control group and the treatment groups were allocated to receive daunorubicin (DNR), Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4 -MNP), and Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles loaded with daunorubicin (DNR-Fe 3 O 4 -MNP). All groups were subjected to hyperthermia in an alternating magnetic field. Tumor volume was measured with a vernier caliper. Daunorubicin concentrations in plasma, tumor and non-tumor tissues were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Tumor and non-tumor tissues were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin for histopathological and microscopic examination. Locations of Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles in tumor tissues were stained with Prussian blue for microscope examination. In Fe 3 O 4 -MNP and DNR-Fe 3 O 4 -MNP treated groups of both K562 and K562/A02 xenograft models, tumor temperature obviously increased and tumor volume became significantly smaller. \u00a0Apoptosis was observed in tumor cells treated with \u00a0DNR-Fe 3 O 4 -MNP groups. \u00a0In all DNR-Fe 3 O 4 -MNP groups of K562 and K562/A02 xenograft tumor models, the tumor inhibition rate, daunorubicin concentration \u00a0were higher level and \u00a0daunorubicin clearance in kidney also was delayed when compared with DNR alone treated group. Location of Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles with Prussian blue staining showed that Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles could be seen in tumor tissues. No obvious histopathological damage was observed in other non-tumor tissues. \u00a0Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles played an important role in increasing tumor temperature during hyperthermia, and can be delivered successfully to tumor site in an alternating magnetic field. Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles loaded with daunorubicin with hyperthermia had the strongest inhibitory effect on tumor and would be potential approach for improving the efficacy of chemotherapeutics, reducing side effects and reversing multidrug resistance in the treatment of leukemia.
