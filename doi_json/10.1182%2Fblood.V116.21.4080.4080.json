    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4080 Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) plays a central role in cell metabolism. PI3K is activated by growth factors, cytokines, and other stimulatory factors in association with their receptors. Activated PI3K in turn initiates signaling transduction to Akt-mTOR and leads to regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of the pathway is widely seen in different types of human cancers, including multiple myeloma (MM). Therefore, PI3K-Akt inhibition is expected to exert broad anti-MM activity. Compound A (CA) is a novel pan-PI3K inhibitor, developed by Novartis Oncology. This compound has shown significant cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in a variety of tumor cell lines. CA is currently being investigated in Phase I clinical trials in solid tumor patients. In this study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo anti-MM activity of CA. Our findings showed that CA induces apoptosis in MM cell lines, ARP1, ARK, MM.1S, MM.1R, CAG and U266, and primary MM cells in both a time-dependent and a dose-dependent manner in vitro . Western blot analysis indicated activation of caspases after CA exposure. The presence of MM bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) or addition of IL-6, the growth cytokine for MM, did not attenuate CA-induced MM cell apoptosis. More importantly, CA only showed limited cytotoxicity toward normal lymphocytes or non-tumoric BMSCs. Results from mechanistic studies showed that CA treatment results in cell cycle arrest in G1 phase by upregulating cell cycle repressor p27 (Kip1) and downregulating cyclin D1. CA treatment also caused decreased anti-apoptotic XIAP expression, and increased cytotoxic small isoform of Bim, BimS expression, both of which may contribute to CA-induced cell apoptosis. In addition to its effect in vitro , CA showed potent anti-MM activity in vivo in an established MM model in SCID mice. CA treatment repressed tumor growth and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. To test the synergistic/addictive effect of CA with other MM chemotherapeutics, we combined CA with melphalan, dexamethasone, lenalidomide, or bortezomib to treat MM cells. Our results showed that low doses of CA and dexamethasone, either of which alone has only limited cytotoxicity, exhibited synergistic anti-MM activity in dexamethasone-sensitive cell lines ARP1 and MM.1S, but not in dexamethasone-resistant cell MM.1R. Western blot analysis suggested that CA and dexamethasone combined treatment in MM.1S results in accumulation of the cytotoxic BimS. Increased BimS expression may cause the synergistic effect of CA and dexamethasone. Thus, our findings suggest CA alone or together with dexamethasone may be a promising treatment for MM.
