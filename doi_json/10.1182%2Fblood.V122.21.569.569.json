    "abstract_text": "Introduction Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a bleeding disorder caused by IgG autoantibodies (AAbs) directed against platelets. The IgG effector functions of autoantibodies depend on their Fc-constant region which undergoes posttranslational glycosylation. We investigated the role of Asn279-linked N-glycan of AAbs in vitro and in vivo . Material and Methods AAbs were purified from ITP patients (n=15) and controls (n=10) and N-glycans were enzymatically cleaved by endoglycosidase F. The effects of native AAbs and deglycosylated AAbs (deAAbs) were compared in vitro on enhancement of phagocytosis of platelets by monocytes and complement fixation and activation applying flow cytometry, laser scanning microscopy, and a complement consumption assay . The capability of AAbs and deAAbs to eliminate human platelets in vivo was studied in a NOD/SCID mouse model in presence and absence of a complement source. Results AAb-induced platelet phagocytosis was inhibited by N-glycan cleavage (median phagocytic activity: 8% vs. 0.8%, p=0.004). Seven out of 15 native AAbs bound C1q and induced complement consumption. N-glycan cleavage significantly reduced C1q binding (MFI 16.4 vs. 4.9, p=0.017) and complement consumption. In vivo survival of human PLTs was assessed after cotransfusion with native or deAAbs in NOD/SCID mice. Injection of AAbs resulted in rapid clearance of human platelets compared to control (platelet clearance after 5h (CL 5h ) 75% vs. 30%, p<0.001). AAbs that were able to activate complement induced more pronounced platelet clearance in the presence of complement compared to the clearance in the absence of complement (CL 5h 82% vs. 62%, p=0.003). AAbs lost their ability to destroy platelets in vivo after deglycosylation (CL 5h 42%, p<0.001). Conclusion Removal of N-glycan from AAbs interferes with Fc-mediated phagocytosis and complement activation and thereby prolongs platelet survival in vivo . Our study provides tools for better characterizing ITP AAbs and sheds light on the heterogeneity of AAbs in ITP. Clinical studies should aim to assess such additional characteristics, since this could lead to the identification of ITP patient subgroups with increased responses to specific or new interventions such as, targetting complement factors.
