    "abstract_text": "Background: Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) offers significant improvements over previous treatments in terms of survival and toxicity yet has been associated with reduced health-related quality of life and very high cost. Discontinuing TKIs with regular monitoring is safe, but little is known about the impact of discontinuation on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). In the largest U.S. study to date, we evaluated molecular recurrence of CML and PROs after TKI discontinuation. Methods: The Life After Stopping TKIs (LAST) study was a prospective single-group longitudinal study. Key inclusion criteria were age > 18 years, patient on TKI therapy (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib) for > 3 years with documented BCR-ABL < 0.01% by PCR for > 2 years, and no previous TKI resistance. We monitored disease outcome (PCRs by central lab) and PROs (PROMIS computerized adaptive tests via REDCap) monthly for the first 6 months, every 2 months until 24 months, then every 3 months until 36 months. Molecular recurrence was defined as > 0.1% BCR-ABL IS by central lab (loss of major molecular response [MMR]). We considered 3 points to be clinically meaningful and hypothesized that by 6 months after TKI discontinuation, fatigue, depression, sleep disturbance, and diarrhea would improve by at least 3 points each, corresponding to a standardized effect size of 0.3. Given reports of a withdrawal syndrome of musculoskeletal pain in some patients after discontinuation, pain was an additional outcome of particular interest. For each PRO domain, we estimated a polynomial piecewise linear mixed effects model that specified one nonlinear trajectory after TKI discontinuation and, for those with molecular recurrence, another trajectory after TKI restart. The models included patient-level random effects for the intercepts and linear slopes. Results: From 12/2014 to 12/2016, 172 patients enrolled from 14 U.S. sites. Median age was 60 years (range 21-86) and 89 (52%) were female. The median time on TKI prior to enrollment was 81 months (IQR 54-123). With a minimum follow-up of 24 months, 107 (62%) patients remained in a treatment free remission (TFR). Reasons for restarting therapy were: loss of MMR by central (n=56) or local (n=2) lab, patient decision (n=4), and withdrawal syndrome (n=3). Missing PRO data was minimal (< 5%) with > 2000 assessments completed. For patients in TFR at 6 months, the average estimated improvement in fatigue was 2.6 points (95% CI 2.5-2.7), depression was 1.9 points (95% CI 1.8-1.9), sleep disturbance was 0.9 points (95% CI 0.8-1.0), and diarrhea was 2.7 points (95% CI 2.6-2.7). The average estimated worsening in pain interference (i.e., the extent to which pain affects daily life) was 0.4 points (95% CI 0.3-0.5). The figure shows the distribution of estimated change for each domain at 6 months. All patients showed improvements in depression, diarrhea, and fatigue. About 1 in 6 patients (17%) experienced a clinically meaningful (i.e., at least 3 points) improvement in fatigue and/or diarrhea at 6 months. Conclusion: The LAST study is the largest US TKI discontinuation study to date, and the first to include comprehensive PRO measurement. For patients in TFR at 6 months, TKI discontinuation conferred modest benefits in fatigue and diarrhea on average, with a negligible increase in pain interference. Some patients experienced more notable improvements in fatigue and diarrhea. Planned secondary analyses will include change over time up to 3 years and evaluation of additional PRO domains, including anxiety, physical function, social function, and sexual function. Our results provide important new evidence to support shared patient-provider clinical decision making regarding TKI discontinuation for patients with CML. Figure. View large Download slide Figure.
