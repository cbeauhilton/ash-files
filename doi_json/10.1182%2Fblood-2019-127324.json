    "abstract_text": "The vitamin K cycle supports blood coagulation, bone mineralization, and vascular calcium homeostasis. A key enzyme in this cycle, vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR), is the target of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Despite their extensive clinical use, the dose of VKAs (e.g., warfarin) is hard to regulate and overdose can lead to fatal bleeding. Improving the dose regulation requires understanding how VKAs inhibit VKOR, which is a membrane-embedded enzyme difficult to characterize with structural and biochemical studies. Here we achieve a long-standing goal of obtaining crystal structures of human VKOR with warfarin, which represents coumarin-based VKAs; with phenindione, which represents indandione-based VKAs; with superwarfarins, the most commonly used rodenticides; and with vitamin K epoxide in a reaction intermediate state. We have also solved structures of a VKOR-like homolog with warfarin, with vitamin K substrates, and without ligand. These structures show that human VKOR adopts an overall fold with four transmembrane helices (TM) and a large ER-luminal region. VKAs are bound at the active site of HsVKOR, which is formed by the surrounding four-TM bundle and a cap domain on top. The cap domain is stabilized by a linked anchor domain that interacts with the membrane surface. VKOR binds specifically to VKAs through hydrogen bonding to their diketone groups. Mutating VKOR residues recognizing the diketones render strong warfarin resistance. Except the hydrogen bonds, the binding pocket is largely hydrophobic. This pocket is incompatible with warfarin metabolite, explaining the inactivation of warfarin through CYP2C9 metabolism; CYP2C9 and VKOR genotypes can explain 30-50% of the patient variability in warfarin dose. In addition, the high potency of superwarfarins is due to the interaction of their side group with a tunnel where the isoprenyl chain of vitamin K is bound. For VKOR catalysis, the same residues affording the VKA-binding specificity also facilitate substrate reduction Initiation of the catalysis requires a reactive cysteine to form a substrate adduct. Interactions from this stably bound adduct induces a closed conformation, thereby triggering electron transfer to reduce the substrate. Importantly, the open to closed conformational change during catalysis similar to that induced by the binding of VKAs. Taken together, VKAs achieve inhibition through mimicking key interactions and conformational changes required for VKOR catalytic cycle. Understanding of these mechanisms will enable improved strategy to regulate warfarin dose and have a broad impact on thromboembolic diseases and bone disorders.
