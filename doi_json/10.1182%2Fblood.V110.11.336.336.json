    "abstract_text": "Background: Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from related and unrelated donors leads to improvement in longevity and quality of life due to replacement of missing enzyme and engraftment of donor-derived glial cells in patients with LSD. Recently, unrelated umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT) has yielded encouraging results but due to the rarity of LSDs, there has never been a large series of patients transplanted at a single center. Methods: Between 1995 and 2007, 159 consecutive LSD patients received unrelated UCBT at Duke after busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and antithymocyte globulin myeloablation. Cyclosporine+methylprednisolone (n=125) or cyclosporine+cellcept (n=34) was given for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. Cord blood units from 8 US public banks were screened and the unit with high-normal enzyme was selected. Engraftment, enzyme, organ function, neurodevelopmental, neuroimaging, and neurophysiologic studies were performed pre- and post-UCBT. The probabilities of engraftment, overall survival (OS) and GvHD were estimated. Multivariate models for graft and patient factors were analyzed. Results: Median patient age was 1.5 yrs (range 0.05\u201326.3); 19.5% were CMV seropositive; and 41.5% had a performance status2.1x105/kg, and infused CFU >5.7x104/kg. The probability of day+100 Grade III/IV acute GvHD was 10.3% (95%CI 5%\u201315%). Chronic GvHD developed in 25 (18%), 11 of whom were extensive. OS at 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 years was 79.0% (95%CI 73%\u201385%), 71.8% (95%CI 65%\u201379%), 62.7% (95%CI 55%\u201371%) and 58.2% (95%CI 50%\u201367%), respectively. In multivariate analysis, performance status 80\u2013100 (p5.7x104/kg (p=0.02) and matched ethnicity (p=0.05) were independently associated with higher OS. In median follow-up of 4.2 years (range 0.2\u201311.5), all but 3 engrafted patients maintained donor chimerism >90% and all but 4 normalized enzyme level. In patients with high performance status (80\u2013100), the OS at 1, 3 and 5 years was 88.4% (95%CI 79.6%\u201397.1%), 83.5% (95%CI 73.0%\u201394.1%) and 79.5% (95%CI 66.9%\u201392.1%), respectively. Conclusions: Unrelated Cord blood is an excellent graft source for treatment of patients with these fatal disorders, particularly when transplantation is performed in early stages. Pre-transplant performance status and post-thaw CFU dosing were highly predictive of overall survival."
