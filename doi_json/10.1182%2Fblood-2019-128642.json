    "abstract_text": "Aging is an inevitable process associated with eventual deterioration of normal physiological functions. Aged hematopoiesis is associated with increased numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), but with decreased HSC functional activity (e.g. decreased engrafting capability in lethally irradiated mice and a shift in the myeloid:lymphoid bias of the engrafting HSC of the old mice, such that there are more myeloid but fewer lymphoid cells generated from HSC of the old mice). Production of HSC and progenitor (HPC) cells ex vivo is more efficient when cells are cultured in a hypoxic environment of ~ 5% oxygen tension than when cells are grown at ambient air (~21% oxygen). The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment niche that nurtures the survival and production of HSC and HPC and hematopoiesis during adult life is a hypoxic environment (~1-5% oxygen tension) compared to that of ambient air. However, almost all results of studies of young and aged mouse hematopoiesis have been based on numbers and activity of HSC and HPC that have been collected and processed in ambient air. Our recent work evaluating hematopoiesis in BM cells of young adult mice and with human cord blood cells found, through a phenomenon we designated Extra Physiological Oxygen Shock/Stress (EPHOSS), that there is a large loss of HSC with an increase of HPC within minutes of the collection of these cells in ambient air (Mantel et al., Cell, 2015). This led us to reason that perhaps what we know about aging hematopoiesis might not be entirely accurate and that a re-evaluation of aged HSC, HPC, and hematopoiesis was in order. We hypothesized that hematopoiesis in aged (~20-27 months of age) mice may not be as dysregulated as reported but that collection and processing of BM from the aged mice is more sensitive than similar cells from young (~6-16 weeks) mice to EPHOSS-induced events generated by the collection of the cells in ambient air. We evaluated BM from three different mouse strains (CB6, BALB/c, and C57Bl/6) at 20-25 months vs. 6-16 weeks of age, collected/processed in ambient air or hypoxia (3% oxygen). BM from old mice collected/processed under hypoxic conditions exhibited phenotypically increased long-term HSC and common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) numbers and decreased common myeloid progenitor (CMP) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) numbers when compared to old BM collected/processed under ambient air conditions. BM collected from old C57Bl/6 mice under hypoxia had increased engrafting capability more closely matching that of young BM. This was associated with a 3.14-fold increase in the number of competitive repopulating units (representative of functional HSC) in old BM collected under hypoxic conditions compared to old BM collected in ambient air as determined through limiting dilution analysis. The myeloid:lymphoid ratio of old BM collected under hypoxia matched that of young BM collected under air. This was associated with decreased cycling of CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM in old BM collected/processed in hypoxia. Enhanced numbers/function of old BM HSCs collected in hypoxia is associated with changes in expression of CXCR4 (and HSC homing capability), CCR5, stress protein levels (e.g. HSP40 etc) and ROS (both total and mitochondrial). All of these noted changes demonstrated that the old BM collected/processed under hypoxic conditions more closely resemble functionally young BM. Thus, age-related differences between the HSC/HPC populations are not as drastic as previously reported and reflect the increased sensitivity of hematopoiesis from aged mice to an artificial ambient air collection procedure.
