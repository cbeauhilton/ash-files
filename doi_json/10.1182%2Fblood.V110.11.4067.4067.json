    "abstract_text": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from bone marrow cavity are multipotent cells. Their primary function is to support the growth and differentiation of hematologic progenitors. MSCs have been shown to differentiate into a variety of cell types including: bone, adipocytes, cartilage, neuron-like, and muscle-like cells. This project aimed to induce MSCs from rat bone marrow into mature dopamine secreting cells. MSCs were isolated from rat bone marrow, cultured and passaged. After propagating for three generations in vitro culture, MSCs were induced by epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor and retinoic acid. After induction, morphologic change was examined by light microscope. NSE,MAP-2a, b and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was examined by immunocytochemistry. The related genes of the differentiated neurons, such as Nurr-1, nestin, mash-1,DR2-L,AADC and TH were detected by RT-PCR. After MSCs were inducted for 7 days,14 days and 21 days, dopamine production and release in the extract and medium of dopaminergic-induced cultured cells was assayed by dopamine ELISA. After 14 days of induction, MSC showed neuron-like morphologic changes and expressed NSE, MAP-2a, b and TH. RT-PCR. showed that these induced cells expressed nerves stem cells gene Nestin,Nurr-1 and dopamine nerves gene mash-1,DR2-L,AADC,TH. Most importantly, dopamine ELISA analysis showed the evidence of dopamine release in the extract and medium of dopaminergic-induced clonal MSCs. The results suggest that bone marrow MSCs from rat can be induced to differentiate into dopaminergic neuron-like cells in vitro. Bone marrow MSCs will provide a promising source of neural progenitor cells and may be a favorable candidate for cellular therapy of Parkinson\u2019s disease."
