    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4508 Long-term follow-up data of the patients who underwent HSCT more than 2 years ago at a single institution in Japan was presented. The patients who received first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital between January, 1990 and December, 2007 under hematology division were included. Follow-up data were obtained annually from the medical records if the patients visited our institution regularly. If the patients were not followed in our institution, follow-up data were requested to the hospitals where the patients had been followed or questionnaires were sent directly to the patients unless their addresses are not known. These letters were sent annually. The most recent laboratory data and any kind of complications under treatment including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes including usage of insulin, renal failure, dialysis, and any kind of malignancies were requested to be reported. Survival was the most primitive data and the reason of death was defined by one of the authors, HA. Chronic GVHD was excluded from the independent etiology of death. Progression of the disease or complications of the treatment for the progressive disease were considered to be due to relapse. The incidence of each complication was calculated using the number of the patients whose data are available. In total, 622 patients had received transplantation and 370 patients survived more than 2 years. During last two years, 211 patients had been followed in our institution while 74 patients by the institutions outside. Letters were sent directly to rest of surviving patients. As the result, 6 patients could not be reached by any method. Letters had been received without response in 15 patients. 72 patients died later than 2 years after transplantation. Relapse was the most important reason of death even more than 2 years after the transplantation. Although the incidence declined annually, the latest relapse was observed in the patient with CML almost 15 years after the transplantation. Pulmonary complications including bronchiolitis obliterans and infections followed. Secondary malignancy was the reason of death in 7 patients. Chronic kidney disease was already observed in 27 % of the patients who survived 2 years after transplantation and one of the devastating complications. In total of 7 patients needed to start regular dialysis or kidney transplantation and another 2 patients showed eGFR level of less than 15 ml/min/m 2 . Nephrotic syndrome was another renal complication observed in 4 patients. Hypertension was reported on 46/244 (19%) of the patients. Diabetes was reported on 27/241 (11.2%) and 13 of them were on regular insulin treatment. Definitive diagnostic criteria of diabetes were not indicated on this analysis suggesting higher incidence of glucose intolerance in these patients. There were 14 patients developed secondary malignancies diagnosed later than 2 years after transplantation and oral mucosa, tongue, esophagus and colon were the main organs involved. Physicians taking care of those patients were recommended to check kidney function and gastrointestinal tract including head/neck, esophagus and colon for secondary malignancy, as well as hematological status.
