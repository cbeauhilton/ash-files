    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1794 Immune dysfunction is a hallmark of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) including suppressed humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide has shown effective clinical activity against CLL, but its mechanism of action is poorly understood. Previous work has demonstrated that the T cell immunological synapse and functional defects in CLL can be reversed following lenalidomide treatment (J Clin Invest. 2008; 118). Polymerization of F-actin at the NK cell immunological synapse with tumor cells is required for signaling molecules to assemble and regulate NK cell activation and effector function. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize and analyze F-actin polymerization at the immune synapse between NK cells and CLL cells. The impaired immune synapse defect identified in CLL could result from not only the defects of CLL B cells but also defects in the CLL NK cells or a combination of both factors. To investigate the contribution of each factor, we examined synapse formation in experiments using CLL B cells with autologous CLL NK cells or healthy allogeneic NK cells. Conjugates formed with healthy NK cells and CLL B cells exhibited a strong band of F-actin at the immune synapse. In contrast, significantly less actin polymerization at the synapse was observed in autologous CLL NK cells and CLL B cells ( P < 0.01). These results indicate CLL B cells, together with CLL NK cells contributed to the immune dysfunction in CLL. As autologous NK cell function in CLL is suppressed, we investigated the utility of CB as a potential functional source of NK cells for CLL immunotherapy. We examined the effect of lenalidomide on NK cell immune synapse function with CLL B cells acting as APCs. We demonstrated that ex vivo treatment of CLL cells with lenalidomide (500 ng/ml) for 48 hours caused a significant increase in the ability of autologous CLL NK cells to form F-actin immune synapses with CLL B cells. The same treatment of CLL B cells also significantly increased the ability of CB-NK cells to form F-actin immunological synapses with these treated CLL B cells compared to untreated CLL B cells (33.6% to 67.3%, P < 0.01, n=6). Our results also show that lenalidomide treatment of autologous NK cells from CLL patients enhanced synapse formation with treated CLL cells compared to experiments using untreated NK cells, but with reduced function compared to CB NK cells. Of note, lenalidomide treatment was shown to increase the recruitment of the signaling molecule Lck to NK cell:CLL cell synapse site, that is known to regulate lytic synapse function. Importantly, lenalidomide treatment significantly increased CB-NK killing of CLL B cells compared to untreated CLL B cells (20.5% versus 48.2%, E:T ratio of 10:1, n = 6, p < 0.001). These results provide insight into the potential mechanism of action of lenalidomide's anti-leukemic function \u2013 priming CLL tumor cells for enhanced NK cell lytic synapse formation and effector function. In addition, the data suggests that immunotherapeutic strategies utilizing a combination of CB-NK cells and lenalidomide has an enhanced clinical efficacy in CLL.
