    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel) was approved by US FDA for relapsed/refractory (R/R) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) on July 24, 2020 based on results from the pivotal ZUMA-2 (NCT02601313) study, in which an objective response rate (ORR) of 93% and a complete response (CR) rate of 67% were achieved among the 60 treated patients with at least 7 months of follow-up. The study had stringent eligibility criteria, including prior treatment with a BTK inhibitor (BTKi), and only allowed BTKi and/or corticosteroid for bridging therapy. We report here the safety and efficacy of brexu-cel in standard of care practice among centers in the US Lymphoma CAR-T Consortium. Methods: Fourteen centers participated in this retrospective study. Patients who underwent leukapheresis by 6/15/2021 with an intent to manufacture brexu-cel were included. Baseline clinical characteristics, bridging therapy, adverse events after brexu-cel infusion, and post-infusion outcome data were collected. Eligibility for ZUMA-2 was retrospectively determined based on characteristics at the time of leukapheresis. Duration of response (time from initial response to disease progression or death from any cause), progression-free survival (PFS; time from infusion to disease progression or death from any cause) and overall survival (OS; time from infusion to death from any cause) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: At the data cut-off date of 7/9/2021, 107 patients underwent leukapheresis, among whom 93 (87%) completed brexu-cel infusion, 2 (2%) were waiting for infusion, and 12 (11%) did not receive infusion (manufacture failure n=6, organ dysfunction n=1, death n=5). Baseline clinical characteristics of the 93 infused patients are shown in Table 1 . The median age was 67 years and 81% were male. 32% had high risk simplified MIPI, 77% had Ki-67\u226530%, 45% had blastoid or pleomorphic variant, 46% had TP53 alteration, 29% had complex karyotype, and 7% had CNS involvement. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 3. Eighty-two percent had prior BTKi treatment, and 44% had refractory disease to the last line of therapy. Sixty-eight (73%) patients would not have met ZUMA-2 eligibility criteria. Reasons for ineligibility included ECOG PS \u22652 (n=8), CNS involvement by lymphoma (n=6), prior therapies (n=33), cytopenia (n=11), renal or hepatic dysfunction (n=13), other medical conditions (n=18), and active infection (n=2). Sixty (65%) of the 93 patients received bridging therapy, which included BTKi (n=27), venetoclax (n=14), chemotherapy (n=19), CD20 antibody (n=26), lenalidomide (n=3), corticosteroid (n=9), and radiotherapy (n=13). Only 13 (14%) patients received BTKi or corticosteroid alone as in ZUMA-2. Among 93 infused patients, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) rate was 88% (8% grade \u22653), and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) rate was 58% (33% grade \u22653). No grade 5 CRS or ICANS occurred. Medications used to manage CRS and ICANS were 71 (76%) for tocilizumab, 64 (69%) for steroid, and 16 (17%) for anakinra. Twenty-four (26%) patients required ICU admission, 9 patients required vasopressors, and 4 patients required mechanical ventilation. With a median follow-up of 3.0 months (range 0.1-9.6), day 30 response was evaluable in 81 patients, and the ORR was 86%, with 64% CR ( Table 2 ). The ORR/CR rates were 94%/70% for blastoid or pleomorphic variants, 82%/50% for TP53 altered, 84%/61% for BTKi-exposed, 94%/76% for BTKi-na\u00efve, and 88%/67% for those not meeting ZUMA-2 eligibility criteria. The ORR/CR rates were 87%/69% for patients who received bridging therapy and 85%/56% for those who did not. For patients who achieved a response at day 30, the rate of continued response at 3-month was 83.7% (95% CI 68.3%-92.0%). The 3-month PFS rate was 80.6% (95% CI 68.6%-88.4%), and the 6-month OS rate was 82.1% (95% CI 67.7%-90.5%). Conclusions: This multicenter retrospective study demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy data of brexu-cel in R/R MCL in the real world practice. The CRS and ICANS incidences were comparable to those reported in ZUMA-2, but use of tocilizumab and steroid was more frequent than in ZUMA-2. Although 73% of the patients would have been ineligible for ZUMA-2, the ORR and CR rate were comparable to those reported in ZUMA-2. Longer follow-up is necessary to confirm long term safety and efficacy. YW, PJ and FLL are co-first authors, and YL, MW and MDJ are co-senior authors.
