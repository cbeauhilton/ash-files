    "abstract_text": "Mutations and deletions in ribosomal proteins are associated with a group of diseases termed ribosomopathies. Collectively, these diseases are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, bone marrow failure, and an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and subsequently acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This observation highlights the role of dysregulation of this class of proteins in the development and progression of myeloid neoplasms. Analysis of gene expression in CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from 183 MDS patients demonstrated that ribosomal protein L22 (Rpl22) was the most significantly reduced ribosomal protein gene in MDS. Interestingly, we observed that AML patients with lower expression of Rpl22 had a significant reduction in their survival (TCGA cohort, N=200, Log Rank P value <0.05). To assess the mechanism of reduced expression, we developed a FISH probe complementary to the RPL22 locus and assessed for deletion of this locus in an independent set of 104 MDS/AML bone marrow samples. Strikingly, we found that RPL22 deletion was enriched in high-risk MDS and secondary AML cases. We, therefore, sought to investigate whether reduced Rpl22 expression played a causal in leukemogenesis. Using Rpl22-/- mice, we found that Rpl22-deficiency resulted in a constellation of phenotypes resembling MDS. Indeed, Rpl22-deficiency causes a macrocytic reduction in red blood cells, dysplasia in the bone marrow, and an expansion of the early hematopoietic stem and progenitor compartment (HSPC). Since MDS has been described as a disease originating from the stem cell compartment, we next sought to determine if the hematopoietic defects were cell autonomous and resident in Rpl22-/- HSC. Competitive transplantation revealed that Rpl22-/- HSC exhibited pre-leukemic characteristics including effective engraftment, but a failure to give rise to downstream mature blood cell lineages. Importantly, there was a strong myeloid bias in those downstream progeny derived form Rpl22-/- HSC. Because human MDS frequently progresses to AML, we examined the potential for Rpl22-deficient HSC to be transformed upon ectopic expression of the MLL-AF9 oncogenic fusion. Indeed, Rpl22-deficient HSPC exhibited an increased predisposition to transformation both in vitro and in vivo, in MLL-AF9 knockin mice. To determine how Rpl22-deficiency increased the transformation potential of HSC, we performed whole transcriptome analysis on Rpl22-/- HSC. Interestingly, four expression signatures were observed that were consistent with the altered behavior exhibited by Rpl22-/- HSC. Rpl22-deficient HSC exhibited increased expression of: 1) genes associated with stem cell function, consistent with the basal expansion and effective engraftment of Rpl22-/- HSC upon adoptive transfer; 2) markers of the myeloid lineage, providing a potential explanation for the myeloid bias exhibited by Rpl22-/- HSC; 3) cell cycle regulators, consistent with the increased proliferation exhibited by Rpl22-/- HSC; and 4) components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, a metabolic program on which leukemic stem cell function depends. Together, these data suggest that Rpl22 controls a program of gene expression that regulates the predisposition of HSPC to myeloid transformation.
