    "abstract_text": "Objective: Joint damage due to recurrent joint bleeds remains the most common complication in hemophilia. The combination of cartilage degeneration and synovial inflammation ultimately lead to hemophilic arthropathy. Cartilage destruction is considered to result from both cartilage matrix-degrading proteases as well as cartilage-destructive pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1b. To unravel the role of IL1b in the pathogenesis of blood-induced cartilage damage, we investigated whether direct blocking of IL1b specifically prevents blood-induced cartilage damage in vitro . Moreover, we investigated whether blocking IL1b after the onset of a bleed can still avert cartilage damage. Methods : Full thickness healthy human articular cartilage explants, obtained post-mortem, were cultured for four days in presence or absence of 50% v/v whole blood. A recombinant human IL1b monoclonal antibody (IL1bmAb) was added at the moment of blood exposure in a concentration of 0, 1, 3, 10, 30, or 100ng/mL (n=8). Furthermore, 100ng/mL IL1bmAb was administered directly or after a delay of several hours up to two days (n=7). Cartilage matrix proteoglycan turnover was determined 12 days later to analyse long-term effects. To investigate the direct effects of IL1bmAb on cartilage, explants were cultured for four days in the presence of 10ng/mL IL1bmAb in the absence of blood (n=7). Results : Exposure to blood decreased the proteoglycan synthesis rate and -content, and increased the proteoglycan release (all p0.50). Conclusions : This study demonstrates that IL1b is a crucial factor in the development of blood-induced cartilage damage in vitro . Blocking this pro-inflammatory cytokine with a monoclonal antibody protects cartilage from the damaging effects of blood exposure in a dose-dependent way. Early administration after blood-exposure is most beneficial. Further research is warranted to investigate the in vivo capacity of IL1bmAb in prevention and its position as a treatment to limit joint damage upon joint bleeding.
