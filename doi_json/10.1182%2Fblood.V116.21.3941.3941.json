We developed an ADC that combines SN-38, the active component of irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, with the internalizing, humanized, anti-CD22 IgG, epratuzumab, and determined its activity alone and in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody therapy (veltuzumab). Methods: Epratuzumab was conjugated with SN-38 (E-SN-38) at a mole ratio of \u223c6:1. The conjugate is designed specifically to be released slowly in the presence of serum (50% released over \u223c1.5 days), allowing liberation of the drug when internalized, but also being released locally after being bound to the tumor. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to assess the activity of the conjugate against several subcutaneously- or intravenously-inoculated B-cell lymphoma cell lines. In vivo studies also examined combination therapy using E-SN-38 and the veltuzumab (V). Results: In vitro studies in 4 B-cell lymphoma cells lines (Daudi, Raji, Ramos, WSU-FSCCL) and 4 acute lymphoblastic lymphoma cell lines (697, REH, MN-60, and RS4;11) expressing varying amounts of CD22 showed an IC 50 for E-SN-38 in the nanomolar range, confirming potent activity. Nude mice bearing SC Ramos human lymphoma had significant selective anti-tumor activity compared to a control, non-targeting, IgG-SN-38 conjugate, at a dosing regimen of 75 to 250 \u03bcg of the conjugates given twice-weekly for 4 weeks. Significant anti-tumor activity was also found in several other cell lines. When combined with veltuzumab, significant improvement in therapeutic activity was observed. For example, median survival in a WSU-FSCCL human follicular B-cell lymphoma IV model with treatment initiated 5 days after implantation was 42 d (0/10 surviving at 160 d) and 91 d (2/10 surviving) for untreated and veltuzumab-treated animals, respectively; 63d (0/10 surviving after 160 d) and >160 d (with 6/10 surviving) for E-SN-38 and E-SN-38 + V, respectively; and 63 d (0/10) and 91 d (2/10) for non-targeting IgG-SN-38 conjugate alone and combined with V). The E-SN-38 conjugate combined with V was significantly better than all treatment or control groups ( P \u2264 0.05). Conclusion: E-SN-38 ADC is a potent therapeutic, even at non-toxic dose levels, and shows significantly enhanced efficacy when combined with anti-CD20 immunotherapy, representing an important new ADC treatment regimen.
