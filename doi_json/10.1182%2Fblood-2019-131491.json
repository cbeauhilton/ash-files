    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Our group has developed a novel vaccine using patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and autologous dendritic cells (DCs), capable of presenting a broad array of leukemia antigens. In a phase I/II clinical trial DC/AML vaccination led to an expansion of leukemia-specific T cells. We hypothesized that the fusion vaccine offered a unique platform for ex vivo expansion of functionally potent leukemia specific T cells with broad specificity targeting shared and tumor specific neoantigens. We postulated that incorporating 4-1BB (CD137) mediated co-stimulation would further enhance activation of antigen specific T cells and the development of a crucial memory response as well as promote survival and persistence. Here we describe therapeutic exploration of the use of 4-1BB to augment vaccine-educated T cells for adoptive cellular therapy in an immunocompetent murine model. Methods : DC/AML fusion vaccine was generated using DCs obtained from C57BL/6J mice and syngeneic C1498 AML cells as previously described. T cells were obtained from splenocytes after magnetic bead isolation and cultured with irradiated DC/AML fusion vaccine in the presence of IL-15 and IL-7. Following co-culture, 4-1BB positive T cells were ligated using agonistic 4-1BB antibody (3H3 clone, BioXCell) and further selected with RatIgG2a magnetic beads (Easy Sep). Subsequently T cells were expanded with anti-CD3/CD28 activation beads (Dynabeads). In vivo, mice underwent retro-orbital inoculation with C1498 and vaccination with irradiated fusion cells the following day. Agonistic mouse anti-4-1BB antibody was injected intraperitoneally on day 4 and day 7. In addition, C1498 cells were transduced with Mcherry/luciferase and a reproducible model of disease progression was established. Results: DC/fusion stimulated T cells showed increased immune activation as measured by multichannel flow cytometric analysis. Compared to unstimulated T cells, there was 5-fold increase in CD4+CD25+CD69+, and a 10-fold and 7-fold increase in 4-1BB and intracellular IFN\u0194 expression on CD8+ cells respectively. Following agonistic 4-1BB ligation and bead isolation, the proliferation rate was increased in the 4-1BB positive fraction as compared to both 4-1BB negative cells and unstimulated T cells. In addition, the 4-1BB positive fraction demonstrated increased cytotoxicity, as measured by a CTL assay detecting granzyme B with 1:10 tumor to effector cells. A shift from na\u00efve to memory T cell phenotype was also observed. Following DC/fusion stimulation, CD44+CD62L- cells comprised 67% of CD8+ cells versus 20% without stimulation, the latter reflecting the effect of cytokines alone. Following 4-1BB ligation and anti-CD3/CD28 bead expansion, this phenotype was retained with the CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory and central memory compartments comprising the majority of T cells. Such findings are significant as presence of memory T cell populations are a critical component for successful adoptive cell transfer. The effect of agonistic 4-1BB antibody following vaccination was evaluated in vivo in an aggressive immunocompetent murine AML model. The combination of DC/AML fusion vaccine with 4-1BB antibody was associated with increased long-term survival (>120 days) of 40% versus 20% of mice treated with vaccine alone while all controls required euthanasia by 40 days. Conclusion: In the current study we have demonstrated the ability of DC/AML fusion vaccine to stimulate T cells ex-vivo as demonstrated by both early-activation (CD25,CD69), upregulation of antigen-specific markers (CD137) and cytokine secretion. Further enhancement of the cellular product using agonistic 4-1BB ligation and isolation simultaneously enriches for antigen-activated cells, as demonstrated by more potent cytotoxicity, as well as promoting memory phenotype and survival. Use of 4-1BB ligation for antigen-specific selection while providing an agonistic co-stimulatory signal is a potentially novel approach for development of non-engineered T cells. Ongoing experiments evaluating the efficacy of 4-1BB selected vaccine educated T cells using bioluminescence monitoring will be reported as well as in vitro use of patient-derived T cells.
