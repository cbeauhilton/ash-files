    "abstract_text": "Background: Stem and progenitor cell populations sequentially accumulate and lead to cancer through various genetic/epigenetic alterations. The stemness and its association with the tumor microenvironment (TME) have not been studied in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Methods: Molecular data from Gene Expression Omnibus of 702 DLBCL patients who received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone combined with rituximab (R-CHOP) were analyzed. A one-class logistic regression (OCLR) machine-learning algorithm was applied to obtain a stemness index (mRNAsi) for each patient and to build molecular stemness-associated genetic signature. A novel stemness molecular signature was established via artificial intelligence to evaluate therapeutic response and prognosis in DLBCL. The significance between the stemness signature and TME cell-infiltrating characteristics was dissected. Results: mRNAsi was biologically significant among DLBCL subtypes and was associated with overall survival (OS). Based on refined 12 stemness-related genes, the stemness molecular signature was able to classify DLBCL patients into high- and low-risk groups. The signature could accurately predict OS and provide a clinically-significant risk stratification in distinguishing DLBCL patients who benefitted from R-CHOP therapy from those with poor outcomes. TME analysis revealed negative correlation between DLBCL stemness origin and features of infiltrating immune cells. Two additional immunotherapy cohorts validated above discoveries in which patients with low-risk score showed significant clinical benefits from PD1/PD-L1 blockade. Conclusions: mRNAsi and stemness molecular signature as new prognostic algorithm was valuable to quantify DLBCL stemness and therapeutic resistance. Such molecular signature and stemness prediction model represent a solid foundation of biologic features for cancer stem cell therapy and immunotherapy in DLBCL.
