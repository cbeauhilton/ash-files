    "abstract_text": "Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) is a distinct disease form with less aggressive phenotype mimicking chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). CNL sometimes has a unique p230BCR/ABL gene abnormality, as does Philadelphia-positive myeloproliferative disease (MPD) mimicking essential thrombocythemia (Ph+ET). The reason of the phenotypic difference between CNL and Ph+ET remains unclear. Recently, we have generated the p230BCR/ABL-transgenic mice, whose disease phenotype is MPD mimicking ET, to study the disease phenotype. In studies of human leukemia cells, loss of DCC (deleted colorectal carcinoma) gene expression is reported in about 20% of CML cases. To investigate whether loss of DCC expression plays a role in the disease phenotype of p230BCR/ABL-expressing MPD, we crossmated p230BCR/ABL-transgenic (BCR/ABL Tg/\u2212 ) mice with DCC-heterogenous (DCC +/\u2212 ) mice, thereby generating p230BCR/ABL-transgenic, DCC-heterogenous (BCR/ABL Tg/\u2212 DCC +/\u2212 ) mice. BCR/ABL Tg/\u2212 DCC +/\u2212 mice have a short latency (9 to 12 months) compared with BCR/ABL Tg/\u2212 DCC +/+ mice (17 to 20 months) for developing overt MPD. Less thrombocytosis (91\u2013140x10 4 /mm 3 ) was found in the BCR/ABL Tg/\u2212 DCC +/\u2212 transgenic littermates compared with the BCR/ABL Tg/\u2212 DCC +/+ transgenic littermates (115\u2013170 x 10 4 /mm 3 ). Leukocytosis and the percentage of granulocytes in BCR/ABL Tg/\u2212 DCC +/\u2212 mice were greatly increased compared with BCR/ABL Tg/\u2212 DCC +/+ transgenic littermates (6.1\u201313.5 x 10 3 /mm 3 vs 5.0\u201311.2 x 10 3 /mm 3; 42\u201368 % vs 23\u201349 %). However, blasts, which were detected in the blastic crisis, were not found in the peripheral blood of either mouse line. Thus, the DCC-heterozygote, in cooperation with p230BCR/ABL cDNA, shortened the latency period of overt MPD, and changed the disease phenotype from MPD mimicking ET to MPD mimicking CNL. However, pathological analysis of the bone marrow, spleen, liver, etc. did not reveal any difference between the BCR/ABL Tg/\u2212 DCC +/\u2212 transgenic littermates and the BCR/ABL Tg/\u2212 DCC +/+ transgenic littermates.",
