    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4389 Introduction: The W-x-x-W motif is commonly found in the thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) of various extra cellular proteins called TSR super family proteins, including thrombospondins, ADAMTSs, F-spondin and properdin. The W\u2013x\u2013x\u2013W motif is known to bind with heparin, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, collagen and transforming growth factor-\u03b2, suggesting functional significance in cell\u2013cell interaction and/or cellular signaling. However, the function of W-x-x-W in ADAMTS13 is unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of the W-x-x-W motif of ADAMTS13. Materials and Methods: We generated a W-x-x-W mutant (W387A) construct of ADAMTS13, and expressed the mutant and the wild-type constructs in HELA cells. Percentage of the protein secretion was defined as the concentration in the culture medium divided by the concentrations in the culture medium and cell lysates, multiplied by 100%. The binding affinity of the mutant or wild-type ADAMTS13 was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Measurement of ADAMTS13 proteolytic activity toward von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers was based on the generation of a dimeric 176-kDa fragment resulting from cleavage of VWF at the Y1605-M1606 bond, under denaturing condition and high shear stress condition, analyzed by Western blots. Results: SDS-PAGE gel analysis showed that the W387A mutant was secreted less efficiently relative to the wild-type construct. As for the binding affinity for the VWF multimer, there was no difference between the wild-type and mutant ADAMTS13. The W387A mutant was less active under denaturing condition; the same result was reproduced when FRETS-VWF73 was used as the substrate. However, under high shear stress condition, the mutant was as efficient as the wild-type ADAMTS13. Conclusions: The W\u2013x\u2013x\u2013W motif is necessary for efficient secretion of ADATMS13. Further studies are needed to determine the contribution of the motif to the VWF cleave activity of ADAMTS13. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
