    "abstract_text": "The rate of prothrombin to thrombin conversion by factor Xa (Xa) is enhanced when Xa is incorporated into the surface-bound prothrombinase complex. However, in comparison to the free state, Xa within the prothrombinase complex is afforded protection from antithrombin + heparin (AT+H) inactivation. We have shown that, unlike AT+H, a covalent conjugate of AT and H (ATH) can neutralize fibrin-bound thrombin. In this study, AT+H and ATH were compared in their reaction with Xa +/\u2212 prothrombinase complex. Mixtures of CaCl 2 , phospholipid vesicles, factor Va (Va) and prothrombin in TSP buffer, were combined with Xa. Following addition of either AT+H or ATH, time samples were neutralized with Na 2 EDTA + polybrene + substrate (S-2222) and residual Xa activity measured. Second order rate constants (k 2 ) were calculated from plots of activity versus time. Results were compared to corresponding experiments with Xa alone. AT+H inactivation of Xa in prothrombinase occurred at a k 2 (x 10 7 M \u22121 min \u22121 ) of 2.34 +/\u2212 0.09. In contrast, neutralization of free Xa by AT+H was significantly faster (k 2 = 8.34 +/\u2212 0.18, p = 0.03). Reaction with ATH showed no significant rate difference for Xa inhibition in either the complexed or free states (18.5 +/\u2212 3.3 and 16.3 +/\u2212 3.7, respectively). Intriguingly, the rates achieved for ATH inhibition of complexed and free Xa were significantly greater than that for AT+H with free Xa (p=0.03 and p=0.02, respectively). We conclude that covalent complexes of AT and H do not encounter resistance in the inhibition of Xa in prothrombinase, as seen for non-covalent AT+H mixtures. Thus, it is possible for ATH to effectively inhibit the propagation phase of thrombin generation and thus dampen thrombin production via neutralization of Xa in prothrombinase."
