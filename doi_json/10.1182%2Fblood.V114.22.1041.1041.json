So far, T cells and natural killer (NK) cells are the major immune effectors shown to be involved in AML control. The graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect following allogenic stem cell transplantation as well as donor lymphocyte infusions indicate that T lymphocytes can control and eliminate AML cells. Leukemia-specific antigenic peptides have been characterized (proteinase-3 and Wilms tumor 1 protein) and serve as targets for peptide-based vaccine trials in AML. Allogenic NK cells have anti-leukemic activity as shown by killer cell inhibitory receptor (KIR)-mismatched haplo-identical stem cell transplantation. Less is known regarding the role of gd T cells in the control of AML. Recently the reconstitution of Vd1 T lymphocytes post transplantation has been shown to correlate with a better prognosis. In the present study, we have analyzed gd T cells in patients with AML and in a mouse model of human AML and focused on (Vg9) Vd2 T cells, the main subset of circulating gd T cells with anti-neoplastic activity. Human Vg9Vd2 T lymphocytes can be activated by nonpeptidic antigens such as the mevalonate pathway-derived isopentenyl pyrophosphate or synthetic phosphoantigen such as bromohydrin pyrophosphate (BrHPP). This population may be suitable for the adoptive immunotherapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However little is known about the frequency, the function and the mechanisms underlying Vg9Vd2 T-cell recognition of AML. We have focused this study on AMoL which are targets of NK and ab T cells. OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY to describe Vg9Vd2 T cells in patients with AML and investigate their ability to induce an effective cytotoxic response against autologous AML blast in vitro and in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURe: We compared the phenotype and the absolute circulating Vg9Vd2 T cell levels in the blood and the bone marrow (BM) in 12 patients with AMoL (FAB AML-M4 and -M5) and 12 healthy volunteers (HV) using multi parametric flow cytometry. All patients and volunteers gave written informed consent. Vg9Vd2 T cells of AML patient were expanded ex vivo using BrHPP or Zoledronic acid plus IL2. The functions of expanded Vg9Vd2 T cells were assessed in vitro by their cytotoxicity against leukemic blasts (CD107a staining, 51Cr assay) and in vivo in immunodeficient mice transplanted with human AML cell line (U937). In these experiments, the ability of adoptively transferred Vg9Vd2 T cells to migrate into BM and improve mice survival was assessed after i.v. infusion of U937 cells into healthy female NOD-SCID, common _-chain knockout mice (NOG mice). Mice were then treated twice i.v. with 40.106 Vg9Vd2 T cells. RESULTs: Vg9Vd2 T lymphocytes are present in the blood as well as BM of AMoL patients at a lower frequency as compared to HV (median 2.07/\u03bcl vs 34/\u03bcL respectively P<0.001). Vg9Vd2 T lymphocytes from AML patients are endowed with in vitro proliferation in response to BrHPP or Zoledronic acid plus IL2 but lower than HV (fold increase median 33 versus 69, P=0.051). Expanded Vg9Vd2 express activation markers (CD69 and CCR5) and exhibit an effector/memory phenotype (CD45RA- CD27-). Their lytic potential toward autologous AML blast was equivalent to those of HV by 51Cr experiments and CD107a staining and involves the perforin-granzyme pathway. Their activity depends on both TCRVd2 and DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM-1) as demonstrated by antibody blockade. In vivo data show that, upon sacrifice, Vg9Vd2 were detected in BM, spleen and blood of mice. Preliminary Kaplan-Meier analysis of pooled cohorts of Vg9Vd2-treated and untreated mice reveals that mice receiving Vg9Vd2 T cells displayed superior survival compared with untreated controls (P=0.0047). CONCLUSIOn: Altogether, our data indicate that Vg9Vd2 T cells are decreased in AML patients and have a more limited expansion potential. However, they are able to kill autologous AML blast upon stimulation in a TCRVd2 as well as the DNAM-1 receptor dependent manner. These results provide a rationale for the clinical evaluation of adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded allogenic Vg9Vd2T cells or direct activation of Vg9Vd2T cells with IL2 + phosphoantigens in patients with AML.
