    "abstract_text": "Ectopic delivery of HOXB4 elicits the in vitro and in vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) although the mechanism is still unknown. We have previously shown that overexpression of HOXB4 attenuates the TNF\u03b1 signaling pathway at the transcriptional level (Schiedlmeier et al ., 2007, PNAS). TNF\u03b1 is expression is induced at high levels in vivo after irradiation used in bone marrow (BM) transplantation preparative regimens. Since HSC and progenitors (P) derived from Fanconi anemia (FA) knockout mice are hypersensitive to the action of inhibitory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, we chose the Fancc \u2212/\u2212 mouse as a model to study the physiologic effects of HOXB4 on TNF\u03b1 sensitivity of HSC/P and the relationship of these effects to the engraftment defect of FA HSC. Competitive repopulating assays were used to evaluate the effect of HOXB4 overexpression upon engraftment of Fancc \u2212/\u2212 BM. Control (CON, expressing eGFP only) transduced Fancc \u2212/\u2212 BM demonstrated 80-fold lower engraftment compared with wild type (WT) eGFP + BM at 26 weeks post-transplant (Table 1). In marked contrast, HOXB4 transduced (HOXB4 + ) Fancc \u2212/\u2212 BM showed a 26-fold higher level of engraftment compared with CON transduced Fancc \u2212/\u2212 BM and a 2-fold higher level of engraftment compared with Fancc \u2212/\u2212 cells corrected with a FANCC-expressing vector. Fancc \u2212/\u2212 BM co-transduced with both vectors (expressing HOXB4 and FANCC) further increased the level of engraftment to that of WT eGFP + BM suggesting a synergistic correction of the FA HSC engraftment defect. To determine the potential role of TNF\u03b1 signaling in these effects, we directly assessed the impact of HOXB4 expression on the response of Fancc \u2212/\u2212 BM to treatment with TNF\u03b1. Fancc \u2212/\u2212 BM cells transduced with the CON eGFP vector demonstrated >70% reduction in colony formation upon treatment with 10ng/ml TNF\u03b1 (Table 2), while Fancc \u2212/\u2212 BM overexpressing HOXB4 showed no significant inhibition of CFU at 10ng/ml TNF\u03b1 compared to either untreated cells or to treated WT BM transduced with eGFP CON vector. Additionally, in vitro treatment of eGFP CON transduced Fancc \u2212/\u2212 BM with 100ng/ml TNF\u03b1 resulted in a 21\u00b15% decrease in lineage-, Sca-1 + , c-Kit + (LSK) cells within 24 hrs. In contrast, similarly treated HOXB4 + Fancc \u2212/\u2212 demonstrated a 6\u00b19% increase in LSK cells (p<0.01 compared to Fancc \u2212/\u2212 eGFP CON). Hence HOXB4 completely protects Fancc \u2212/\u2212 HSC/P against the inhibitory effects of TNF\u03b1. In order to further define the mechanism through which HOXB4 attenuates TNF\u03b1 signaling, we determined the level of expression of the TNF\u03b1 receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, on transduced Fancc \u2212/\u2212 BM by flow analysis. Fancc \u2212/\u2212 LSK BM transduced with eGFP CON or FANCC expressing vectors had equivalent expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2 compared to WT eGFP CON transduced BM (Table 3). In contrast, Fancc \u2212/\u2212 LSK cells transduced HOXB4 demonstrated a >25% reduction in the number of cells that stained positive for either TNFR1 or TNFR2. In addition, there was a >35% decrease in the MFI of staining for TNFR1 in HOXB4 + Fancc \u2212/\u2212 LSK compared to other groups. In summary, ectopic HOXB4 protects Fancc \u2212/\u2212 and WT HSC/P from the inhibitory effects of TNF\u03b1. Since HOXB4 expression also protects WT cells from TNF\u03b1 treatment (data not shown), we propose that HOXB4 enhances engraftment by protecting HSC from the elevated TNF\u03b1 levels, which is a result of conditioning regimens applied to transplant recipients. We suggest that this mechanism reveals a novel target for the pharmacologic manipulation of HSC during engraftment, thus avoiding the potential adverse effects of constitutive HOXB4 overexpression.
