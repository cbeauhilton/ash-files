    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2002 In this study, we investigated the clinical characteristics of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients using sibling donors with HLA-B*5801-TNF\u03b1-308A haplotype (B5801-TNF2) for haploidentical or identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A total of 136 B-ALL cases and 29 T/NK-ALL cases were recruited. DNA samples from the patients and their siblings were assayed for genotyping of HLA and TNF\u03b1 at -308 (rs1800629). B5801-TNF2 haplotype in donors was determined by analyzing TNF\u03b1 -308 and HLA-B genotypes in patients and their family members. Outcomes within 2 years including overall mortality and non-relapse mortality, disease course and complications within 100 days were compared among patients using related donors with HLA-B*5801-TNF\u03b1-308A haplotype for haploidentical HSCT (B5801-TNF2+HID group), those using related donor without HLA-B*5801-TNF\u03b1-308A haplotype for haploidentical HSCT (B5801-TNF2-HID group), and those using related sibling either B5801-TNF2+ or B5801-TNF2- haplotype for identical HSCT (SID group). In the 165 sibling donors after HSCT, 35 were found to carry HLA-B*5801-TNF\u03b1-308A haplotype. There were 21 cases in B5801-TNF2+HID group, 100 cases in B5801-TNF2-HID group, and 44 cases in SID group. Compared patients in B5801-TNF2-HID and SID groups, patients in B5801-TNF2+HID group had higher overall mortality (adjusted P =0.039) and non-relapse mortality within 2 years (adjusted P =0.001), delayed platelet engraftment (adjusted P <0.0001), higher incidences of severe acute graft-versus-host disease ( P =0.007), severe late onset hemorrhagic cystitis ( P =0.002), blood stream infection ( P =0.017), and invasive fungal disease ( P =0.004) within 100 days. Therefore, sibling donors carrying HLA-B*5801-TNF\u03b1-308A haplotype for haploidentical HSCT caused higher mortality rate and higher frequency of severe complications in ALL recipients.
