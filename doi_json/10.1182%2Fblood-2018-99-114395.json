A subset of B lymphocytes expressing CD5 is found in patients with AIHA/Evans syndrome. Previous studies have shown that the number of CD5 + B lymphocytes is correlated with the severity of AIHA/Evans syndrome. IL-10 can be induced in various types of human B cells, including naive, memory, and CD5 + B cells, following B-cell activation by Th-cell-dependent and TLR-dependent signals. This study is to investigate the secretion function of CD5 + B lymphocytes in AIHA/Evans syndrome (ES) patients. Methods : 25 untreated AIHA/ES patients, 28 remission AIHA/ES patients and 25 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. The quantity of CD5 + B lymphocytes which produce interleukin-10 (IL-10) (CD5 + IL-10 + ) were detected by flow cytometry. CD5 + B lymphocytes were sorted from Peripheral blood (PB) by CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer. The expression of IL-10 mRNA in CD5 + B cells were measured by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). The concentrations of IL-10 in serum were detected by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The percentage of CD5 + IL-10 + B cells in CD5 + B lymphocytes in newly diagnosed patients was 82.18\u00b114.78%, which being significantly higher than that of remission AIHA/ES patients (56.68\u00b124.39%) and HC (51.90\u00b122.95%)(p<0.05). The percentage of CD5 + IL-10 + B cells in CD5 + B lymphocytes in newly diagnosed patients was negatively correlated with their serum level of hemoglobin, C3 (P<0.05) and positively correlated with their serum level of LDH, TBIL and IBIL (P<0.05). The expression level of CD5 + B lymphocytes IL-10 mRNA in newly diagnosed patients (49.34\u00b122.84) was higher than that of remission patients (3.97\u00b13.83) and HC (1.78\u00b11.66) (P<0.05). The concentration of IL-10 in serum in newly diagnosed patients (4.01\u00b11.54 pg/ml) was lower than that of remission patients (5.08\u00b11.72pg/ml) and HC (5.70\u00b11.60pg/ml) (P<0.05). Conclusions: Most CD5 + B lymphocytes secrete IL-10 in AIHA/Evans patients and are positively correlated with the severity of the disease. The increased quantity of CD5 + IL-10 + B cells and the decreased cytokines-secreted level maybe involved in the occurrence of AIHA/Evans syndrome.
