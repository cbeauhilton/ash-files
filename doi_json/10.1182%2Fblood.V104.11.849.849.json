    "abstract_text": "The metalloprotease ADAMTS-13 cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF) that is released from endothelial cells as a large multimeric protein. However, the specific physiological conditions required for the function of this von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease (VWF-CP) are not yet established. In this study we determined the optimal conditions for the VWF-CP activity using the Cone and Plate(let) Analyzer (CPA). Proteolysis of a soluble recombinant VWF by a recombinant VWF-CP in the absence or the presence of BaCl 2 (for induction of VWF-CP) was performed under static and flow (2050 s \u22121 ) conditions. The resulted fragments of the soluble VWF were immobilized on a polystyrene surface and non-adhering sites were blocked with 1% BSA. In parallel, polystyrene surface immobilized VWF was similarly treated by VWF-CP. The immobilized cleaved VWF fragments by the above protocols served as a substrate for citrated whole blood platelet adhesion under flow (2050 s \u22121 ). Reduction of platelet adhesion (surface coverage, SC) in BaCl 2 treated compared to untrerated sample reflects the degree of VWF-CP activity. Platelet adhesion (SC, %) to VWF proteolytic products generated under the indicated conditions:  . Static w/o BaCl2 . Static + BaCl2 . Flow w/o BaCl2 . Flow + BaCl2 . Soluble VWF 15.0 \u00b1 3.4 11.1 \u00b1 2.7 13.6 \u00b1 2.2 8.0 \u00b1 2.1 Immobil. VWF 19.1 \u00b1 3.0 12.0 \u00b1 4.1 6.5 \u00b1 1.1 1.0 \u00b1 0.6 . Static w/o BaCl2 . Static + BaCl2 . Flow w/o BaCl2 . Flow + BaCl2 . Soluble VWF 15.0 \u00b1 3.4 11.1 \u00b1 2.7 13.6 \u00b1 2.2 8.0 \u00b1 2.1 Immobil. VWF 19.1 \u00b1 3.0 12.0 \u00b1 4.1 6.5 \u00b1 1.1 1.0 \u00b1 0.6 View Large Maximal VWF-CP activity as reflected by maximal reduction (85%) of platelet adhesion was observed when immobilized VWF was treated by VWF-CP under flow. Minimal effect of VWF-CP activity was observed when soluble VWF was treated under static condition (26% reduction). Intermediate effect was observed with soluble VWF under flow (41%) and with immobilized VWF under static condition (37%). It should be noted that in the case of immobilized VWF application of flow alone (without BaCl 2 ) was sufficient to induce a remarkable decrease of platelet adhesion (66%). In conclusion, both immobilization of VWF and high shear stress are important conditions for VWF-CP function, suggesting that stretching of immobilized VWF under flow exposes the VWF-cleavage site and thereby may serve as a control mechanism of platelet adhesion at the site of thrombus formation.",
