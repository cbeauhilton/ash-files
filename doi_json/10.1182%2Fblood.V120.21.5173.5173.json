Methods: In a single blinded randomized placebo controlled study, thirty subjects with iron deficiency anemia (serum ferritin < 15 ug/dl) were randomized to intervention arm (vitamin D 6 lakh IU IM once) or placebo. In all subjects, iron deficiency was corrected with parental iron. All the causes other than iron deficiency were excluded with appropriate investigation. The primary end point was rise in hemoglobin concentration. Results: Baseline age, BMI, hemogram, levels of serum ferritin, 25(OH)D and PTH were similar in both the arms. Twelve weeks after vitamin D replacement, there was significant increase in 25 (OH) D levels and decrease in PTH levels in subjects with intervention arm compared to placebo arm (p<0. 01). The increment in serum ferritin in both the group was similar. There was no further increase in hemoglobin concentration in intervention arm compared to placebo arm. Conclusion: Vitamin D replacement in subjects with iron deficiency anemia after iron correction does not improve hemoglobin concentration further. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
