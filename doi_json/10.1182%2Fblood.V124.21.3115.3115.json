    "abstract_text": "Waldenstr\u00f6ms Macroglobulinemia (WM) is a unique form of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, in which the tumor compartment is comprised of B-lymphocytes, plasmacytoid lymphocytes and plasma cells. The majority of WM cases are immunophenotypically characterized by expression of surface antigens that are present on both B-cells (CD19/20) and plasma cells (CD38/138). However, in advanced stage disease, which has been treated with various chemoimmunotherapeutics the molecular profile of WM cells can drastically shift resulting in a majority of the WM tumor compartment exhibiting loss of CD20 and concurrent upregulation of atypical surface antigens ( Barakat et al, Am J Clin Pathol 2011; Morice et al Mod Pathol 2009 ). These external immunophenotypic changes are associated with underlying epigenetic and genomic alterations, whose integrated study may provide further insight into the biology of advanced stage WM. Moreover, such an analysis holds clinical potential by uncovering of therapeutic vulnerabilities, which can direct the selection of appropriate therapeutics for patients with CD20- WM. With this in mind, we conducted comprehensive molecular testing coupled with functional studies to understand if underlying genomic/epigenetic changes correlated with drug sensitivity using appropriate preclinical models of CD20+ WM (BCWM.1 cell line) and CD20- WM (RPCI-WM1 cell line). Importantly, the index patient from whom the CD20- cells were developed had received a total of 6 lines of treatment, two of which contained rituximab and was documented as being refractory to rituximab. Immunophenotyping of CD20- cells showed differential downregulation of 19 and upregulation of 7 CD antigens relative to CD20+ WM cells (cutoff at 1.5 fold; >20% gated expression). Upregulated antigens were associated with a phenotype reminiscent of a memory B-cell with plasmacytoid features. Next, we conducted RNA-Seq analysis (Illumina HiSeq), which revealed downregulation of 6,673 and upregulation of 4,594 genes (>1.5 fold cutoff) in CD20- WM cells compared with CD20+ cells. Gene pathway enrichment analysis (NextBio, Illumina Inc.) of mRNA differentially expressed in CD20- cells showed significant enrichment of upregulated genes corresponding to Protein Transport (p90% viability and demonstrated significantly less apoptosis in presence of ibrutinib (4uM) compared to CD20+ cells, suggesting decreased reliance on canonical BCR signaling for survival. In parallel and guided by pathway analysis results, we exposed both CD20- and CD20+ WM cells to a novel 19S proteasome inhibitor (VLX1570), which caused profound proteotoxicity and ER stress at concentrations ranging between 250 \u2013 500nM. We noted CD20- cells were significantly more sensitive (p<0.01) to 19S proteasome inhibition than CD20+ WM cells indicating the formers critical dependence on tightly regulated protein homeostasis. In summary we describe for the first time, a comprehensive molecular and immunophenotypic investigation of CD20- WM cells compared to CD20+ WM cells, using validated preclinical models of the two disease phenotypes. Overall our data suggests significant architectural differences between CD20+ and CD20- WM, which can potentially impact the behavior of the cells and their sensitivity towards novel therapeutics being developed for treatment of advanced stage WM.
