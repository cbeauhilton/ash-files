    "abstract_text": "KIT constitutive activation is thought to be necessary but not sufficient for the development of aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) and mast cell leukemia (MCL). The identification and dissection of cooperating pathogenetic pathways may set the basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. We have recently found that the HMC-1.1 and -1.2 MCL cell lines and ASM/MCL patients (pts) display histone H3 Lys36 trimethylation (H3K36Me3) deficiency as a result of non-genomic loss of function of the SETD2 methyltransferase. SETD2 plays a key role in the control of transcription and splicing fidelity, homologous recombination (HR), mismatch repair (MMR). Inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation by bortezomib restored SETD2 protein expression and H3K36Me3. Reversing the detrimental effects of SETD2 and H36K36Me3 deficiency may be a promising therapeutic strategy. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of SETD2 loss of function in ASM and MCL and to assess the in vitro efficacy of second-generation proteasome inhibitors as therapeutic agents. To investigate whether increased DNA damage and reduced HR proficiency can be observed in SETD2/H3K36Me3-deficient SM, we used western blotting and immunofluorescence to assess phosphorylated histone 2A.X (\u03b3H2AX), which marks ongoing DNA damage signaling and DNA double strand breaks and Rad51, which is a surrogate for active HR. Compared to cells from healthy controls, cells from SETD2- and H3K36Me3-deficient MCL pts had significantly higher levels of \u03b3H2AX and Rad51. To assess whether the increased DNA damage may translate into a greater number of submicroscopic genomic lesions, and whether the degree of SETD2 down-modulation may be inversely correlated with the degree of genomic complexity, SNP-array data from 13 pts were examined. Structural complexity score (SCS) and genome instability index (GII) were not significantly different (SCS, 387 vs 376; GII, 0.293 vs 0.337) between pts with > or <50% residual SETD2 and H3K36Me3 levels, suggesting that the activity of HR repair may counteract DNA damage events. Moreover, SETD2 down-modulation was not associated with reduced MMR proficiency, as assessed by lack of microsatellite instability. On the other hand, RNA-seq in SETD2-deficient pts showed evidence of transcription and splicing defects like transcription-induced chimeras and intron retention not observed in healthy donors. In renal cell carcinoma cell lines, SETD2 has been shown to bind and activate p53. After proteasome inhibition, SETD2 was indeed found to immunoprecipitate with p53 in HMC-1.1 and -1.2 cells. Rescuing the interaction between SETD2 and p53 with bortezomib stabilized p53 and upregulated the expression levels of p53 targets including p21, p27, Bax and Gadd45a. This restored inhibition of cell proliferation, block of the transition towards cell cycle checkpoints and consequent activation of apoptosis. The ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2 was also found to complex with SETD2 after proteasomal inhibition. Treatment with SP-141, a new class of MDM2 inhibitors that promote MDM2 auto-ubiquitination and degradation, also rescued SETD2 expression and H3K36Me3, suggesting that MDM2 may play a role in SETD2 degradation in ASM and MCL. Moreover, SP-141 treatment of HMC-1 cells at micromolar doses for 24-48-72-96 hours induced cytostatic but not cytotoxic effects as shown by cell growth curves. Cytostatic effects resulted from a G2/M block of cell cycle induced by Gadd45a overexpression. Clonogenic assays supported the cytostatic effects of SP141 in HMC-1.1 and -1.2 cells (LD50=0.133\u00b5M and 0.050\u00b5M respectively). Finally, treatment with the second-generation proteasome inhibitors carfilzomib and ixazomib potently induced apoptosis and reduced colony growth in HMC-1.1 (LD50=0.10nM and 0.66nM respectively) and -1.2 (LD50=0.13nM and 0.72nM respectively) cells. In conclusion: MDM2-mediated ubiquitination contributes to SETD2 non-genomic loss of function in ASM and MCL. Loss of SETD2 and H3K36Me3 is associated with increased DNA damage and transcription and splicing defects in ASM and MCL pts and is likely to afford an alternative mechanism for the inactivation of the p53-mediated checkpoint without the need for TP53 gene mutations. Approaches aimed to inhibit MDM2 activity or proteasome-mediated degradation are promising therapeutic strategies worth to be further explored.
