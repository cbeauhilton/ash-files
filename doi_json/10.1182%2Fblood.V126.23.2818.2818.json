    "abstract_text": "Background: Pegylated interferon alpha-2a (Peg INF2a) has been demonstrated to be active therapy for high-risk essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and early myelofibrosis (MF). We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of Peg INF2a therapy in myeloproliferative (MPN) patients treated outside the constraints of a clinical trial. Methods: Charts were analyzed for demographic and clinical data. Toxicity to therapy was assessed per CTCAE 3.0 criteria. Therapeutic responses for ET and PV were calculated by the revised ELN/IWG-MRT criteria including complete remission (CR), partial resmission (PR), no response (NR), or progressive disease (PD). Responses in MF were calculated by EUNMET: complete response (CR), major response (MR), moderate response (MoR), minor response (MiR) and NRand the revised IWG-MRT/ELN criteria : CR, PR, clinical improvement (CI), stable disease (SD) or PD. Results: Patients: 75 patients were identified overall. There were 36 PV patients (48%), 20 ET patients (26.7%), and 19 MF patients (25.6%). Thirteen MF patients were post-PV/ET MF. The median age at diagnosis was 51.5 yrs (range 28.8-75.1). JAK2 V617 mutation was present in 53 patients (70.7%). Median baseline hemoglobin (g/dL), leukocyte (x10 9 ), and platelet count (x10 9 ) for PV was 13.6, 8.6, 369, for ET was 12.5, 6.8, 517, and for MF was 11.4, 8.0, and 420, respectively. DIPSS risk category for the 19 MF patients: Low in 6 (31.5%) patients, Intermediate-1 in 3 (15.7%), Intermediate-2 in 8 (42%), and High in 2 (10.5%) patients. The majority of patients (82.2%) had received at least one prior cytoreductive therapy for their disease. Therapy: Median starting dose of Peg INF2a was 45 micrograms/week (range 45-90). The median peak dose was 90 micrograms/week (range 45-270). The median tolerated dose was 60 micrograms/week (range 5.6-180). The median duration of treatment was 24 months (range 3.6-85). Toxicity: Overall the Peg INF2a was well tolerated. Hematological toxicity included: leukopenia at grade 1 in 13 patients (17.3%), grade 2 in 5 patients (6.7%), and grade 3 in 1 patient (1.3%), anemia at grade 1 in 10 patients (13.3%) and grade 2 in 1 patient (1.3%), thrombocytopenia at grade 1 in 13 patients (17.3%) and grade 2 in 1 patient (1.3%). The most common non-hematologic toxicity included: fatigue at grade 1 in 14 patients (18.7%) and grade 2 in 4 patients (5.3%), transaminitis at grade 1 in 6 patients (8%) and grade 2 in 3 patients (4%), myalgias at grade 1 in 4 patients (5.3%). Response: See Table #1 PV/ET: 56 patients were evaluated by ELN/IWG-MRT criteria overall: A complete remission (CR) was seen in 8 patients (14.3%), a partial remission (PR) in 18 patients (32.1%), either a CR or PR in 18 patients (32.1%) when histologic remissions were unable to be documented due to lack of restaging bone marrow examination, no response in 11 patients (19.6%), and progressive disease in 1 patient (1.8%). Of the 12 patients receiving at least1 phlebotomy per month, 10 patients (83.3%) became phlebotomy independent with therapy. Of the 20 ET patients, 12 patients (60%) had platelet normalization (<400 x 10 9 ). MF: 19 patients were evaluated by IWG-ELN criteria: a PR was seen in 2 patients (10.5%), CI in 4 patients (21.1%), SD in 12 patients (63.2%), and PD in 1 patient (5.3%). Utilizing EUNMET critieria: 1 patient (5.3%) with a CR, 5 patients (26.3%) with a MR, 3 patients (15.8%) with MoR, 5 patients (26.3%) with MiR, and 5 patients (26.3%) with NR. Table 1.

Given the majority of patients had previously failed cytoreductive therapy these results substantiate prior reports of efficacy of Peg INF2a in MPNs.
