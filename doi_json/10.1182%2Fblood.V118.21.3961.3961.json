    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3961 Renal impairment (RI) is a frequent complication of multiple myeloma (MM). Proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) are used as frontline therapy for MM but their effect on renal function recovery has not been clearly defined. To address this issue we studied 112 patients with newly diagnosed MM and RI who were treated in the Department of Clinical Therapeutics of the University of Athens, over the last decade. RI was defined as an estimated glomelural filtration rate (eGFR) \u226460 ml/min, using the simplified MDRD formula. Patients were divided into three groups; group T included 53 patients who received thalidomide-based regimens (with dexamethasone alone, with dexamethasone and melphalan or cyclophosphamide, or with VAD); group B included 30 patients who received bortezomib-based regimens (with dexamethasone alone, with dexamethasone and thalidomide or with cyclophosphamide) and group L included 29 patients who received lenalidomide-based regimens (with dexamethasone or with melphalan and prednisone). Lenalidomide dose was adjusted for the degree of RI according to current recommendations. Renal complete response (CRrenal) was defined as a sustained increase of baseline eGFR to >60 ml/min, renal partial response (PRrenal) as an increase of eGFR from 30 ml/min (OR: 4.85, 95% CI: 1.9\u201312.5, p=0.001) and age \u226465 years (OR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.07\u201313.5, p=0.038). The median time to first renal response was longer for patients of group L compared to those of group T (5.5 months vs. 1.5 months, p=0.038) and it was significantly shorter for patients of group B (0.85 months, p=0.001). The median time to major renal response was 1.1 months for bortezomib-based and 2.7 months for thalidomide-based regimens, and exceeds 6 months for lenalidomide-based regimens (p=0.002). In multivariate analysis bortezomib-based regimens (OR: 3.12, 95% CI: 1.35\u20137.2, p=0.008) and baseline eGFR >30 ml/min (OR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.13\u20133.3, p=0.015) were independently associated with a shorter time to \u2265PRrenal. Myeloma response to treatment was 61%, 83% and 83% for the three treatment groups, respectively and was associated with any renal response (\u2265MRrenal; p=0.008) and with a major renal response (CRrenal+PRrenal; p=0.001). Among 8 patients who required dialysis (group T 4 patients, group B 4 patients), 4 patients (2 in each group) became independent of this procedure. This is the first analysis which compared the role of the three novel agents in MM patients presenting with RI. Our data indicate that novel agent-based regimens can improve renal function in the majority of patients with RI. However, bortezomib- and thalidomide-based regimens are more efficacious than lenalidomide-based regimens in this setting. Furthermore, bortezomib-based regimens act more rapidly than IMiD-based regimens even in patients with severe RI. We conclude that bortezomib-based regimens are the preferred therapy for newly diagnosed myeloma patients with RI.
