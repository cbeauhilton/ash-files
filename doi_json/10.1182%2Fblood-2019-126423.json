In this study we tried to find the incidence of this mutation in Indian Population. Aims and Objective: -To evaluate clinical parameters like age, sex, clinical presentation and duration of symptoms in atleast 60 de novo AML patients. -Perform bone marrow examination, FAB subtyping and cytogenetic analysis in these cases. -To estimate the prevalence of FLT3-ITD and FLT3-Asp835 mutations by DNA-PCR in these cases. -To compare the FLT3-ITD and FLT3-Asp835 mutations status with clinical parameters and cytogenetics data. Methods: We Included: -All cases of primary de novo Acute Myeloid Leukemia cases, who have not received any kind of chemotherapy for the same. -Cases in whom adequate representative sample was available for cytogenetic analysis and PCR studies. We excluded: -All secondary Acute myeloid leukemia cases. -Children less than 2 years of age. -Patients who have received any chemotherapy before. We did cytogenetics, Flowcytometry and RT-PCR based detection of FLT-3 as per standard protocol. Results and Discussion: In the time period between January 2015 to September 2016, a total of 68 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients were admitted to our Institute and included in the study. In the current study, the following observations were noted: -Around 30% of patients referred to us with a provisional diagnosis of AML are not affording any further workup or treatment. -The median age of occurrence of AML is much lower than in western countries. -De novo cases are much more frequent. -More than 80% of our patients presented with some form of bleeding with infections of variable severity in nearly 90% of patients. -According to FAB classification AML-M2 was the most prevalent subtype in our study. -Nearly 67% of our patients belong to Normal Karyotype followed by inv (16) and t(8:21) in around 10% of cases each. -FLT3-ITD was present in 24% of cases and FLT3-Asp835 mutations were present in 6% of cases in concordance with reported literature. -NPM 1 mutations were present in 24% of cases. -NPM 1 overlapped with FLT3-ITD in 8% of the cases with one case showing overlap of NPM 1 AND FLT3-Asp835 mutation. -At presentation FLT3-ITD positive patients reveal significantly high total count, low hemoglobin, low platelets and high Serum LDH values. -All t(8:21) positive were negative for FLT3 mutations in this study. -FLT3-ITD positivity correlated significantly with dim or no expression of immaturity markers namely CD34 and HLA-DR in Immunophenotyping. -In our study 65.7% of patients achieved complete remission following standard induction -Primary resistant disease was noted in 8% of cases (20% induction failure cases following one cycle of induction). -2% of patients succumbed to induction related mortality with neutropenic sepsis being the major contributor. -Induction failure significantly correlated with FLT-ITD positivity but no significant differences were noted in induction death. -A 42% relapse rate is noted in our patients with >70% of them occurring within a year of therapy completion. -4 % of our treated patients are alive during evaluation with median complete remission duration of 11 months. -Most patients who had a relapse did not undergo further therapy and were referred back to their primary physicians for supportive care only. Since a meaningful survival analysis was not possible with most of these patients being lost to follow up, the overall survival data has not been reported. -Only two patients underwent Allogeneic transplant and were alive during data analysis. -Midostaurin was not available during study period and 30% of patients were put on Sorafenib. Conclusion: In conclusion the prevalence of FLT3 mutations in our population is similar to reported literature. Since patients who harbour FLT3/ITD have dismal outcome with standard therapy and considering the fact in India most patients are unable to afford treatment, patients should be encouraged to be a part of a clinical trial wherever possible. Although the complete response rates in our study are comparable to published literature, even patients who did not have any mutations had a poorer disease free survival compared to patients reported previously who were treated on a similar protocol without stem cell transplantation. Hence there is a need to study the biology of these patients looking at a wider range of genes which can have an impact on the outcomes.
