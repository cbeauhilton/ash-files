    "abstract_text": "C/EBP transcription factors are crucial for the regulation of granulopoiesis in vitro and in vivo. C/EBPa is considered to be the master regulator of \u201csteady state\u201d granulopoiesis via upregulation of several myeloid genes (e.g. ELA2, CSFR3, etc.). The absence of C/ EBPa results in a complete loss of neutrophils. We were able to show that in patients with severe congenital neutropenia (CN) harbouring HAX-1 or ELA2 mutations C/EBPa is severely abrogated secondary to defective expression of LEF-1 ( Skokowa J, et al. Nat Med.  12 , 1191 \u20137 ( 2006 ) ). Therefore, we were interested, whether other transcription factors are capable of substituting C/EBPa, since these patients respond to G-CSF with slight increase in neutrophils from less than 200/ul to above 1500/ul depending on the dose of G-CSF. C/EBP\u03b2 has recently been shown to be required for cytokine induced \u201cemergency\u201d granulopoiesis ( Hirai H, et al. Nat Immunol.  7 , 732 -9 ( 2006 ) ). Therefore, we investigated the expression pattern of C/EBP\u03b2 during G-CSF treatment of CN patients. Indeed, C/EBP\u03b2 mRNA was upregulated 2.8-fold in CD33 + myeloid cells from CN patients by G-CSF treatment, as compared to healthy individuals. It was associated with upregulation of G-CSFR mRNA and \u2013protein expression as well as ligand binding to G-CSFR in myeloid cells, and elevated levels of biologically active G-CSF in serum from CN patients. To confirm C/EBP\u03b2-dependent activation of G-CSFR and G-CSF gene expression, we performed reporter gene assays in CD34 + bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells from two CN patients co-transfected with C/EBP\u03b2 and reporter constructs containing upstream regulatory regions of G-CSF or G-CSFR genes, \u22121470bp and \u2212670bp, respectively. Indeed, C/EBP\u03b2 activated G-CSFR promoter 3.2-fold and G-CSF promoter 5.4-fold. These data demonstrate that in CN patients, G-CSF induces C/EBPa independent granulopoiesis and that C/EBP\u03b2 is required for the response to G-CSF treatment in these patients. C/EBP\u03b2 leads in response to G-CSF to induction of differentiation of neutrophil precursors to mature neutrophils in vivo. Our hypothesis is that in CN the steady state granulopoiesis is abrogated whereas the emergency granulopoiesis still leads to sufficient numbers of neutrophils.",
