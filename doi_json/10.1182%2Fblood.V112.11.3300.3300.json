    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common form of leukemia in the Western hemisphere, is associated with severe innate, adaptive and humoral immune dysregulation. CLL remains essentially incurable, with the potential exception of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Natural killer (NK) cells are CD56(+), CD3(\u2212) large granular lymphocytes that comprise a key cellular subset of the innate immune system. Preliminary in vitro data suggest an NK cell versus CLL effect exists, similar to that observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other blood cancers. Novel immune therapies for CLL (e.g., rituximab, alemtuzumab) likely exert anti-tumor effect, in part, through NK cells, in fact. Although NK cells contribute to the graft-versus-tumor effect following ASCT for other blood cancers, little is known regarding the potential role NK cells may play in the clinical allogeneic transplant setting for CLL. Herein, we provide, to our knowledge, the first report regarding NK cell immune reconstitution following ASCT for CLL. Methods: 27 CLL patients underwent reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) with ASCT. Median age was 52 years (43\u201369), median number of prior therapies was 3 (2\u201311). 55% had chemotherapy-refractory disease, and 55% had \u201chigh-risk\u201d cytogenetics by FISH (deletion 17p or 11q22-23 abnormality). 14 patients had sibling donors, 15 had volunteerunrelated donors. Conditioning regimens included Fludarabine/TBI/Alemtuzumab (n=8), Fludarabine/Busulfan with (n=9) or without ATG (n=6), and Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide (n=4). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus/MMF (n=8) or tacrolimus/methotrexate (n=19). Patients underwent bone marrow assessment prior to day +75 following ASCT. Marrow was studied for engraftment, donor chimerism, and disease status as well as lymphoid immune reconstitution by percentage of total lymphocytes and absolute lymphocyte counts by multi-color flow cytometry. Results: NK cell immune reconstitution was predicted by disease status at transplantation. Patients in complete or partial remission at the time of ASCT had more robust NK cell recovery (mean = 45% of total lymphocytes +/\u2212 SEM 5%) as compared to patients entering transplant with refractory disease (16% +/\u2212 1, p < 0.01). No differences were observed in CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells and no lymphocyte subset recovery was associated with CD34(+) or CD3(+) cell dosage. Achieving complete donor chimerism by day +60 was associated with robust NK cell recovery (55% +/\u2212 1 versus 7% +/\u22121, p = 0.02), recovery of CD4 and CD8 T cells was not associated with chimerism status, however. Patients who went onto exhibit a complete response to ASCT had greater early NK cell reconstitution (31% +/\u2212 3) as compared to those who had no response (8% +/\u2212 1, p = 0.01). No differences in T cell subsets were associated with response. Patients who ultimately achieved complete remission following transplant had a lower CLL:NK cell ratio in marrow (0.35 +/\u2212 0.07) than those who did not (8.1 +/\u2212 1, p = 0.01). However, differences in CLL:CD4(+) and CLL:CD8(+) T cells were not predictive of response. Trends to improvement in progression free survival and overall survival were observed for patients with NK cell reconstitution above the median for the group as compared to those below; no such trends were observed regarding T cell subsets. Greater NK cell reconstitution trended towards ultimate eradication of minimal residual disease following ASCT, but no such trends were observed for T cell subsets. Conclusions: Early NK cell recovery predicts survival following autologous and allogeneic SCT in a number of hematologic malignancies; however, little is known regarding this phenomenon in CLL. To our knowledge, these are the first findings to implicate a potentially important therapeutic role for early NK cell compartment recovery in CLL following ASCT. Further research into restoring and augmenting NK cell function following RIC/ASCT for CLL is warranted.",
