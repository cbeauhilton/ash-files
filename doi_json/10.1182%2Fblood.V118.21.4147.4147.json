    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4147 Introduction: AML is one of the most common indications for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). A matched sibling donor (matched related donor, MRD) is generally considered preferable to an unrelated donor (UD). It has been reported before that donor age may influence outcome of allo-HSCT. Sibling donors of older patients will generally be old as well. How a young unrelated donor compares with an old sibling donor is unclear. In this retrospective study we evaluate the influence of donor age on outcome of MRD and UD allo-HSCT and compare the impact of young unrelated donors vs. old related donors on overall survival (OS). Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 298 consecutive patients transplanted for AML at our center between January 2000 and December 2009. Median follow-up was 56 months. The median age of donors and patients were 39 and 50 yrs. respectively. These two ages were used as cut-off points for young and old donors and patients respectively. Accordingly, four donor aged groups were assigned: UD ' 39 years, UD > 39 yrs, MRD \u2264 39 yrs and MRD > 39 yrs. Analyses were performed in the more homogeneous population of patients in CR at time of transplant (n = 170) as well for patients older than 50 years and in CR at time of transplant (n = 77). Patient characteristics for the 170 Patients in CR are summarized in table 1 . Table 1: Patients' characteristics for patients in CR at time of transplant (n = 170)  Characteristics .

Donor age (p = 0.08) and patient age (p = 0.063) tended to influence OS in this group. In the more homogenous group of 170 patients who were in CR at time of transplantation the Kaplan Meier estimated 5 yr OS was 66% (95% CI: 54%-78%) for patients transplanted from UD \u2264 39 yrs, 41% (95% CI: 25\u201357%) for UD >39 yrs, 61% (41\u201381%) for MRD \u2264 39 yrs and 33% (19\u201347%) for MRD > 39 yrs (p =0.002 comparing all 4 groups), fig. 1 . OS of patients with UD \u2264 39yrs was significantly better than for those with MRD > 39 yrs (66% vs. 33%, p = 0.001). In the multivariate cox-regression analysis (including donor age, patient age and cytogenetic risk) only donor age (p = 0.001) and cytogenetic risk (p = 0.011) significantly impacted OS whereby MRD > 39 yrs. was associated with poorer OS compared to UD \u2264 39 yrs (RR: 3.07, p< 0.001). Further subgroup analyses of patients > 50 years old and in CR at time of transplant (n = 77) revealed similar findings with 5 yr OS of 62% for UD \u2264 39 yrs and 25% for MRD >39 yrs (p = 0.016).

Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings and better define possible age limits for choosing young unrelated donors vs. older sibling donors.
