    "abstract_text": "Abstract 377 Impaired cell death program has been noted as one of the hallmarks of Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and contributes to its accumulation of malignant monoclonal B cells as well as to chemotherapy resistance. A cell can die through apoptosis or necrosis pathway. While apoptosis is known as a regulated cellular program, necrosis is known as an accidental event caused by overwhelming stress. However, accumulating evidence suggests that necrosis can also be executed by regulated mechanisms, especially in apoptotic-deficient conditions. Recently, the term necroptosis has been used to designate one particular form of programmed necrosis induced by stimulating death receptors with agonists such as TNF\u03b1, FasL, and TRAIL. Apoptosis suppression by caspase inhibitors such as zVAD may switch apoptotic response to necroptosis or enhance necroptosis. In contrast to well-characterized apoptotic pathway, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying necroptosis are still not fully understood. A genome wide siRNA screen revealed two members of the receptor interacting protein (RIP) kinase family, RIP1 and RIP3P, to be essential for necroptosis. Upon stimulation of death receptors, RIP3 is recruited to RIP1 to form a necroptosis-inducing complex which is essential for cell death execution. The deubiquitinase cylindromatosis (CYLD) is recruited to TNF\u03b1 receptor upon its activation and directly regulates RIP1 ubiquitination. In addition, by activating key enzymes of metabolic pathways, RIP3 regulates TNF\u03b1-inducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which partly accounts for its ability to potentiate necroptosis. Until now, much less is known about the significance of necroptosis in malignant disease. Here we demonstrate that primary CLL cells failed to undergo necroptosis upon stimulation of TNF\u03b1 combined with pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD. Upon TNF\u03b1+zVAD stimulation, normal CD19+ B cells increased ROS production > 8 fold, while same treatment only resulted in \u223c 2 fold induction in ROS generation in CLL samples. Two core components of necroptotic machine, RIP3 and CYLD, are markedly down-regulated in CLL compared with normal B cells, at both protein and transcription levels. Moreover, we identified LEF1, a downstream effector of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, as a transcription repressor of CYLD in CLL. LEF1 is highly expressed in CLL cells, whereas normal B cells have very low levels of LEF1 expression. Attenuation of LEF1 expression through RNAi technology resulted in a dramatic increase in CYLD levels in CLL cells, as determined by western blot and real time RT-PCR analysis. Dual-luciferase assays showed that forced expression of LEF1 markedly decreased CYLD promoter activity compared with controls. Mutation of LEF1 responsive elements (LERs) on CYLD promoter significantly abolished transcriptional repression of CYLD by LEF1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that LEF1 is recruited to LER region within the CYLD promoter in CLL cells. Additionally, Knocking down LEF1 sensitizes CLL cells to TNF\u03b1-induced necroptosis. The present investigation provides the first evidence that CLL cells have defects not only in apoptotic program but also in necroptotic signaling. Targeting the key regulators of necroptotic machine such as LEF1 to restore this pathway may represent a novel approach for CLL treatment. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
