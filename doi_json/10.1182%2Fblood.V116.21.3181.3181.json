    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3181 Introduction: Elevated levels of inflammatory markers and clotting factors have been related to the pathogenesis of DVT. Particularly, the balance between VWF and ADAMTS 13 activity has been previously described in patients with thrombosis. VWF levels are also described to be elevated during inflammatory processes and therefore could play a role linking the activation of inflammatory and coagulation systems in patients with DVT. Objective: To evaluate the activity of ADAMTS13 and VWF in patients with DVT and its association with inflammatory markers. Patients and Methods: Fifty-five patients with DVT, 6 months to five years after the acute episode, attended at the Hematology Center of UNIFESP were included in this study and 121 normal subjects were selected as controls. The activity of ADAMTS 13 was performed by binding of residual VWF to collagen; VWF antigen, IL-6, IL-8, F1+2 and MCP1 was determined by ELISA and D-dimer and CRP was performed by turbidimetry. Continuous variables were analyzed by Mann- Whitney test, categorical variables by the chi-square test and Spearman rank test was used for correlation analysis. Results: Thirty-tree patients had DVT caused by transient risk factor, especially the use of oral contraceptives, and 22 patients had spontaneous DVT. No patient had renal, hepatic or malignant disease. The median ADAMTS 13 activity was not statistically different between patients (median= 65.8%) and controls (median=78.5%, p= 0.3043). The plasma levels of VWF antigen, IL-6 and CRP were higher in patients than in controls (p= 0.008, p= 0.0003 and p= 0.008, respectively). The levels of IL-8 and MCP1 did not differ betwee n patients and controls (p= 0.65 and p= 0.07, respectively). The levels of VWF correlated significantly with CRP (r= 0.28, p= 0.005) and F1+2 (r= 0.3, p= 0,02) in patients. There was an inverse correlation between ADAMTS13 activity and F1+2 concentrations (r= -0,33, p= 0.01). Conclusion: This study suggests that, even after the acute episode of DVT, a chronic inflammatory state would contribute to increasing levels of VWF in patients' plasma and hypercoagulability. The downregulation of ADAMTS13 activity may also contribute to the activation of the coagulation. However the role of ADAMTS13 in the interaction between inflammatory and coagulation systems in patients with thrombosis is yet to be determined. These factors together may contribute to recurrent DVT, which affects over 25% of patients within 10 years from the first episode. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
