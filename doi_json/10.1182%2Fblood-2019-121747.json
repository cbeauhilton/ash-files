    "abstract_text": "In the evaluation of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) for hematologic malignancy, positive immunoglobulin heavy chain (IG) or T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement results may be detected despite unrevealing results from morphologic, flow cytometric, immunohistochemical (IHC), and/or cytogenetic studies. The significance of positive rearrangement studies in the context of otherwise normal ancillary findings is unknown, and as such, we hypothesized that gene rearrangement studies may be predictive of an emerging B- or T-cell clone in the absence of other abnormal laboratory tests. Data from all patients who underwent IG or TCR gene rearrangement testing at the authors' affiliated VA Hospital between January 1, 2013 and July 6, 2018 were extracted from the electronic medical record. Date of testing; specimen source; and morphologic, flow cytometric, IHC, and cytogenetic characterization of the tissue source were recorded from pathology reports. Gene rearrangement results were categorized as true positive, false positive, false negative, or true negative. Lastly, patient records were reviewed for subsequent diagnosis of hematologic malignancy in patients with positive gene rearrangement results with negative ancillary testing. A total of 136 patients, who had 203 gene rearrangement studies (50 PB and 153 BM), were analyzed. In TCR studies, there were 2 false positives and 1 false negative in 47 PB assays, as well as 7 false positives and 1 false negative in 54 BM assays. Regarding IG studies, 3 false positives and 12 false negatives in 99 BM studies were identified. Sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were calculated for PB TCR studies (94% and 93%), BM IG studies (71% and 95%), and BM TCR studies (92% and 83%). Analysis of PB IG gene rearrangement studies was not performed due to the small number of tests (3; all true negative). None of the 12 patients with false positive IG/TCR gene rearrangement studies later developed a lymphoproliferative disorder, although two patients were later diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. Of the 14 false negatives, 10 (71%) were related to a diagnosis of plasma cell neoplasms. Results from the present study suggest that positive IG/TCR gene rearrangement studies are not predictive of lymphoproliferative disorders in the context of otherwise negative BM or PB findings. As such, when faced with equivocal pathology reports, clinicians can be practically advised that isolated positive IG/TCR gene rearrangement results may not indicate the need for closer surveillance.
