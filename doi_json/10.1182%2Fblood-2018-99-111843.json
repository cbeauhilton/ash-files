    "abstract_text": "Background and Aims: In immunosuppressed individuals Aspergillus (A.) fumigatus is a frequent cause of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) which is highly associated with relevant morbidity and mortality. Moreover, it often occurs in patients suffering from leukocyte-adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD1) which is triggered by a functional loss of CD18 in \u00df2 integrin receptors as these receptors consist of an alpha subunit (CD11a-CD11d) and CD18 as the common beta subunit. \u00df2 integrin receptors are differentially expressed by leukocytes, and are required for cell-cell interaction, transendothelial migration, uptake of opsonized pathogens, and cell signaling processes. Here, we asked for the importance of CD11b/CD18 also termed MAC-1 which is required for phagocytosis of opsonized A. fumigatus conidia by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) for control of pulmonary A. fumigatus infection. Methods: We used a murine IPA model (C57BL/6) and challenged CD11b deficient (CD11b-/-) or wild type (WT) mice with A. fumigatus conidia intratracheally. Afterwards, some mice were sacrificed 24h after infection. In these mice PMN recruitment and cytokine patterns were examined by analyzing bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood (PB) using flow cytometry, cytospin analysis, and cytometric bead array. Additionally, pulmonary fungal clearance and inflammation in murine lungs were analyzed by fungal culture assays and histopathologic examination using a scoring system. Furthermore, survival was studied with neutropenic animals serving as positive controls. To determine PMNs phagocytic activity and fungal killing capacity ex vivo , PMN were purified from bone marrow of CD11b-/- or WT mice by magnetic cell sorting using Ly6G specific antibodies. Afterwards, isolated PMN were stimulated with pacific blue-labeled tomato red-fluorescent modified A. fumigatus conidia and analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: We found that lung homogenates from CD11b-/- mice obtained 24h after infection showed an enhanced fungal burden as compared to lungs from WT mice. In contrast, lung tissue from infected CD11b-/- mice displayed impaired pulmonary inflammation as assessed by Hematoxilin-Eosin (HE) staining. Furthermore, the number of mucus-producing cells in bronchi of A. fumigatus infected CD11b-/- mice was decreased compared to cells in bronchi of WT mice. However, we observed markedly higher numbers of PMN in BALF of infected CD11b-/- mice compared to corresponding WT mice samples. In contrast, BALF derived from infected CD11b-/- mice contained lower levels of three different proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) compared to BALF from WT mice while levels of other cytokines and chemokines (IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, GM-CSF, CXCL1, CCL2) were comparable. In contrast, we measured higher levels of the chemokine CCL5 known as a relevant chemoattractant in innate and adaptive immune cells in BALF obtained from CD11b-/- mice. Interestingly, numbers of PMN, lymphocytes, and monocytes in the peripheral blood of A. fumigatus infected mice did not differ in a genotype-dependent manner. However, CD11b-/- mice PMN showed lower phagocytic activity than WT PMN, indicating an impaired capability to clear A. fumigatus . Nevertheless, CD11b-/- mice were finally characterized by similar long-term survival as WT mice after IPA induction while the PMN-depleted control mice died as expected. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates, that CD11b deficiency on myeloid cells affects the early course of IPA. This may be due to the importance of MAC-1 for PMN effector functions, and their interplay with DC and other leukocytes. Further work is necessary to elucidate the long-term course of IPA in CD11b-/- mice with regard to the interplay of PMN with dendritic cells, the efficacy of adaptive immune responses, and the potential pulmonary overexpression of CCL5. Beyond patients with LAD1 syndrome, we suggest our findings as being clinically relevant in other immunocompromised patients suffering from severe opportunistic infections.
