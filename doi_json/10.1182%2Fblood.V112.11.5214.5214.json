    "abstract_text": "Serum levels of sIL-2R represents the total amount of activated T-lymphocytes in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes of cancer tissues and metastatic organ sites. Most malignant diseases overexpress sIL-2R in comparison to non-malignant controls. Immunomodulatory effect of IL-2 therapy on interferon (IFN), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) production, nuclear factor kappa\u2013b (NFkb) in vivo and in vitro and on the expression of sIL-2R in Human Immunodeficiency Virus \u2013 Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (HIV-WM) patients with IgM is not well defined. We present a 42 year old female with HIV, CD4-343/cu mm, viral load (VL) of >100K (persistently elevated VL), hypercoagulable state, serum viscosity >3 centpoises, IgM level of >1 gram with serum free light chain kappa/lambda ratio elevated as well as IgG and IgA on immunofixation studies. She was treated initially with BPD (Biaxin, Pentoxifylline, Dexamethasone) with partial response and with poor paraprotein parameter response. Her HAART regimen consisted of ritonavir base therapy. When dexamethasone was weaned off and prednisolone therapy started, greater than 50% reduction of paraprotein (IgM) occurred over 4\u20136 weeks. We measued serum sIL-2R, C-reactive protein (CRP), throughout treatment over 12 weeks. The serum sIL-2R level significantly decreased from 21,513.274 pg/ml to 5,424.779 pg/ml (normal 3,592.9 \u2013 9,734.5 pg/ml). The C-reactive protein normalized and IgM was now 0.211 gram and within normal limits as well as serum viscosity. CONCLUSIONS: The suppression and modulation therapy of CRP gene transcription with manipulation of NFkb/IKKb with ritonavir based HAART and BPD-Pred with normalization of sIL-2R, CRP, and IgM paraprotein in HIV-WM patients may have an independent effect on prognosis and maintenance therapy. Serum sIL-2R levels may serve as a useful marker in evaluating HIV-WM disease, stage for stage and monitoring disease progression.",
