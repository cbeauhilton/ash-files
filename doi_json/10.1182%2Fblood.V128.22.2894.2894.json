    "abstract_text": "The 90 kDa Ribosomal S6 Kinase (RSK), downstream of the ERK signaling pathway, has recently been implicated in a wide variety of cancers, ranging from lung cancer to medulloblastoma, as a driver of cancer cell proliferation and survival. However, its role in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) remains unknown. Thus, the goal of this study was to characterize RSK-dependent signaling pathways in AML, with the overall hypothesis that disruption of this pathway represents a potential strategy for the treatment of AML. The RSK family consists of four gene isoforms, RSK1-4 ( RPS6KA1 (RSK1) , RPS6KA2 (RSK3) , RPS6KA3 (RSK2) , RPS6KA4 (RSK4). Knockdown (KD) of RSK1 by shRNA in HL-60 and KG-1 cell lines resulted in reduced AML cell growth in vitro . NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ (NSG) mice were injected with 2x10 6 HL-60 or KG-1 RSK1KD cells and vector control transduced cells in order to investigate the effects of RSK1 KD on AML cell growth and survival in vivo. Mice injected with RSK1 KD cells exhibited prolonged survival by 17 and 21 days respectively for HL-60 and KG-1 cell induced disease (p=0.0023 and 0.0018 respectively). These data indicate that RSK1 knockdown inhibits leukemia progression, and RSK1 is required for maximal proliferation of AML cells in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of total RSK (RSK1-4) by the small molecule inhibitor BI-D1870 reduced AML cell growth and induced cell death in both AML cell lines and patient samples after treatment for 48 hours. The IC 50 for growth inhibition was 1.8 uM for MOLM-13, 1.6 uM for MV-4-11, and 1.9 uM for HL-60 cells. In methylcellulose colony assays, normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell proliferation was not affected by RSK inhibition up to a concentration of 15 uM, establishing an approximately 10-fold therapeutic index. To elucidate the mechanism by which RSK inhibition suppresses AML proliferation, we performed cell cycle analysis with HL-60 cells. RSK inhibition by BI-D1870 resulted in delayed S-phase progression and accumulation of cells in late S-phase with increased pH2AX, cPARP, and CDK2/Cyclin A expression, as measured by flow cytometry. These data indicate that inhibition of RSK leads to activation of DNA damage pathways and arrest in S-phase, resulting in apoptosis. Inhibition of CDK activity rescued S-phase arrest, demonstrating that activation and dysregulation of CDK are crucial mediators of RSK inhibitor-induced S-phase arrest. In summary, this is the first study to demonstrate that RSK plays an important role in maintaining AML cell survival and proliferation and to position RSK as a promising target for treatment of AML.
