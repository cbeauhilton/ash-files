    "abstract_text": "Inherited thrombophilia could increase susceptibility to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as fetal loss. We determined the G1691A mutation of the factor V gene (FVL), the G20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene, the C677T polymorphism of the methylentetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) gene, the HPA-1 polymorphism of the b subunit of the platelet integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 and the C807T polymorphism of the \u03b1 subunit of integrin \u03b1 2 \u03b2 1 in 104 women with fetal loss and 277 normal women. In a subgroup analysis of women with recurrent early fetal loss (n=34), the prevalence of the genetic markers did not differ significantly between the women with early fetal loss and the normal women. However, in this subgroup of patients, the onset of fetal loss was significantly earlier in women with the \u03b1 2 807TT genotype (7.1 \u00b1 1.9 vs. 8.8 \u00b1 1.5 weeks, p=0.001). No such significant difference was observed in carriers of the other genetic markers. In the subgroup analysis of women with late fetal loss (n=70), only the prevalence of heterozygous FVL was significantly associated with late fetal loss (odds ratio 3.2, p=0.002). There was no significant association of any genetic risk factor with premature fetal loss in the subgroup analysis of women with at least one late miscarriage. This study demonstrates a significant association of the \u03b1 2 807TT genotype of the platelet membrane integrin \u03b1 2 \u03b2 1 with premature onset of early fetal loss. Based on our results it appears that this risk factor does not induce the pathomechanism but modulates the course of fetal loss. Furthermore, our study confirms the association of FVL with late fetal loss.",
