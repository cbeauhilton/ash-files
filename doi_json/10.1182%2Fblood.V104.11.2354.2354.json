    "abstract_text": "Angiogenesis or formation of new blood vessels from existing blood vessels, in contrast to vasculogenesis or de novo formation of new vessels, plays an important role in the progression and spread of most cancers. Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by increased microvessel density (MVD), a quantitative estimate of angiogenesis, which correlates with stage of disease. MVD increases with progression from MGUS to smoldering MM to newly diagnosed MM and relapsed MM. It is a powerful prognostic factor, predicting for overall survival. To further elucidate the biological basis for the prognostic value of increased angiogenesis in MM, we studied the interactions of MM cells with endothelial cells using HUVECS as a model system. Co-culture of MM cells (MM1.S, OPM2, U266) with HUVECS induced tumor cell proliferation. Enhanced tumor cell proliferation correlated with the number of HUVECs and was greater than that triggered by co-culture with patient bone marrow stromal cells. When HUVECs were fixed prior to co-culture there was a significant decrease in the tumor cell proliferation. Addition of HUVEC conditioned media to the MM cell lines also induced proliferation. Importantly, HUVECS protected against anti-MM agents including conventional agents (Dexamethasone, Doxorubicin, Melphalan) and novel drugs (Revlimid\u2122). The protective effect afforded by co-culture was lost on HUVEC fixation. Intracellular signaling events following MM cell-endothelial cell contact were studied to understand the mechanisms of the proliferative and protective effects. Western blotting demonstrated activation of the JAK/STAT, PI3K/Akt and the MAPK pathways, mediating proliferation and survival. Ongoing studies focused on understanding cytokine as well as adhesion-mediated interactions between the endothelial cells and the MM cells will identify targets for new therapeutic approaches in MM."
