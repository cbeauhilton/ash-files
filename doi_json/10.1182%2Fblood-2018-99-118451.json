    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Patients with polycythemia vera (PV) have poor overall survival compared with the general population, with arterial and venous thrombotic events (TEs) representing a substantial source of morbidity and mortality. A subanalysis of the Cytoreductive Therapy in Polycythemia Vera (CYTO-PV) study demonstrated a significant correlation between white blood cell (WBC) count \u226511 \u00d7 10 9 /L and time-dependent risk of major thrombosis (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.24-12.3). The objective of this analysis was to describe the association between WBC levels and occurrence of TEs among patients with PV from a large, real-world population. Methods: This was a retrospective, observational study using Veterans Health Administration claims data collected between 10/1/05, and 9/30/12. Patients with \u22652 claims for PV ( ICD-9-CM code 238.4) \u226530 days apart during the identification period (10/1/06 to 9/30/07) were eligible for analysis. The earliest date for a PV claim within the identification period was designated as the index date. All patients were \u226518 years of age, had no TEs before the index date, and had continuous health plan enrollment with medical and pharmacy benefits \u226512 months pre-index. Patients were followed up until death, disenrollment, or end of study period, whichever occurred first. Patients with \u22653 WBC values per year on average during the follow-up period and, for patients with a TE, \u22651 WBC value before the TE were included in the analysis. Based on the last measurement before the TE or end of follow-up, patients were assigned to one of the following WBC categories: WBC <7.0, 7.0-8.4, 8.5-<11.0, and \u226511.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L. A univariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the risk of TEs between WBC categories using <7.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L as the reference group. Results: A total of 1565 US veterans with PV were included in the analysis (WBC [\u00d7 10 9 /L] <7.0, n=428 [27.3%]; 7.0-8.4, n=375 [24.0%]; 8.5-<11.0, n=284 [18.1%]; \u226511.0, n=478 [30.5%]). Patient demographics were similar across groups ( Table 1 ). The mean Charlson Comorbidity Index and Chronic Disease Scores were similar across groups and ranged from 1.11-1.45 and 6.15-6.76, respectively. Hypertension was the most common comorbid condition among patients across all WBC categories (65.1%-71.5%). Mean follow-up times across groups ranged from 3.6 to 4.5 years. Rates of cytoreductive treatment, including phlebotomy, were similar across WBC groups and ranged from 77.3% to 78.2% (any cytoreductive treatment) and 56.9% to 65.9% (phlebotomy). The mean number of phlebotomies per patient per year was 2.6, 2.6, 4.7, and 3.0 among patients with WBC counts <7.0, 7.0-8.4, 8.5-<11.0, and \u226511.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L, respectively. Overall, 390 patients (24.9%) experienced a TE during the study period, including 85 patients (19.9%) with WBC <7.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L, 91 patients (24.3%) with WBC 7.0-8.4 \u00d7 10 9 /L, 73 patients (25.7%) with WBC 8.5-<11.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and 141 patients (29.5%) with WBC \u226511.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L ( Figure 1 ). Compared with the WBC <7.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L reference group, the hazard ratios (95% CI) for TEs were 1.22 (0.91-1.64; P =0.1835), 1.39 (1.02-1.90; P =0.0401), and 1.81 (1.39-2.38; P <0.0001) among patients with WBC counts 7.0-8.4, 8.5-<11.0, and \u226511.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L, respectively ( Table 1 ). Conclusion: A significant, positive association between increased WBC counts and occurrence of TEs in patients with PV was observed in this study. Patients with WBC counts \u22658.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L had a significantly increased risk of TE, and those with counts \u226511.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L were at greatest risk. Effective control of WBC counts is an important component of disease management and may reduce risk of TEs in patients with PV.
