    "article_date": "November 16, 2004",

    "abstract_text": "Sustained complete remissions (CR) have been reached with allogeneic transplant in patients with poor prognosis B-CLL; however, mortality rates are high (20\u201350%); in order to reduced TRM, NM conditioning are widely used in haematological malignancies; however it is not clear if the use of NM regimens can maintain the efficacy reducing the toxicity. IN this report we performed a retrospective comparison between 30 patients (group A) who have received myeloablative conditioning consisted of TBI plus Cy in 23 pts (74%), TBI, Cy plus VP-16 in 6 pts (19%) and BuCy in 1 patient and 31 patients (Group B) who have received a NM transplant. Conditioning regimens in Group B included: Fludarabine plus Melphalan, 20 pts (64%), Fludarabine, Busulphan and ATG, 5 pts (16%), Fludarabine, TBI and ATG, 4 pts (13%) and Fludarabine plus TBI, 1 patient. All patients received peripheral blood stem cells from a HLA related identical donor. T-cell depletion was performed in 14 patients of the group A. Median age at transplant was significantly higher in the group B patients (53 versus 45, respectively) (p<0,005); no differences were observed in terms of status at transplant and n\u00b0 of previous chemotherapy lines as well in the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and transplant related mortality (TRM) (See Table, below). With a median follow-up of 71 and 36 months for groups A and B respectively,Overall Survival and Event Free Survival are similar for both groups (53% versus 64% and 60% versus 68%, respectively). Although patients in the NM transplant group were older toxicity was similar in both groups; moreover a similar efficacy has been observed suggesting the clear role of graft versus tumour effect in B-CLL probably more important that the type ofconditining.
