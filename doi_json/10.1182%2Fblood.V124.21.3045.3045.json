    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Multiday, highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimens are commonly used in the management of hematologic malignancies. Despite progress in prophylaxis, CINV, especially during the delayed phase, can remain a significant barrier to attaining planned chemotherapy dose on time for some patients. A granisetron transdermal system (GTS) has been shown to be as effective as oral granisetron in controlling CINV across multiple tumor types. This post-hoc analysis specifically examined the efficacy and safety of GTS in patients with hematologic malignancies. Methods : A randomized, phase 3 study has been published comparing GTS (7 day application) to oral granisetron (2 mg/day) in patients receiving either moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy for 3-5 days. Data for this analysis were limited to patients with a primary tumor diagnosis of lymphoma (n=51), leukemia (n=27), or multiple myeloma (n=5). The rates of complete control (CC; no vomiting, mild nausea, no rescue medication) and complete response (CR; no vomiting, no rescue medication) using either GTS or oral granisetron were compared during both the acute (first 24 hours) and delayed phase (days 2 to 5) following chemotherapy. Need for rescue medication and patient assessment of response to therapy with GTS were also compared. Results : 83 hematologic cancer patients (31 GTS, 52 oral granisetron) were included. The majority of patients received a non-cisplatin regimen with corticosteroids (59 patients; 71%). Patients received chemotherapy for 3 days (37; 45%) or 4 to 5 days (46 patients; 55%). During the acute phase of CINV, the CC rate of 94% and CR rate of 94% in the GTS group were similar to rates in the overall population (94% and 95%, respectively). There was no difference in CC and CR between GTS and oral granisetron in the acute phase ( P =0.90 and 0.59, respectively). In the delayed phase, GTS resulted in CC in 87% and CR in 90%; compared with CC in 77% and CR in 81% of patients given oral granisetron ( P =0.26 and 0.25, respectively). The use of rescue medication over the entire study period and patient assessment of overall response to therapy were not different between arms ( P =0.60 and 0.92, respectively). GTS was well tolerated; the only treatment related adverse event was one case of mild constipation. Conclusion : This retrospective analysis suggests GTS may be an appropriate option for prevention of CINV in hematologic cancer patients. A trend toward improved control in the delayed phase was observed and further investigation of a benefit in delayed CINV for hematologic malignancies may be warranted.
