    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: In sepsis, many red blood cell (RBC) defects are described: \u2191 oxygen (O 2 ) affinity, \u2193 deformability, \u2191 aggregation & adhesion, and dysregulated RBC-based vasoregulation. We suggest these comprise a unique class of organ (RBC) failure, which we term sepsis-induced RBC dysfunction (SiRD). We propose SiRD arises from RBC metabolic failure and depowered antioxidant systems - resulting in impaired RBC physiology that disables O 2 transport. We employed a murine cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis model to characterize SiRD features and explore mechanisms of SiRD initiation. METHODS: Mice underwent sham (G cont ), mild (G mild : D1 mortality 10%), or severe CLP (G sev : D1 mortality 50%); N=4-8/group. D1 RBCs were collected. SiRD phenotype was characterized by analyzing: (1) O 2 affinity (p50, Bohr effect), (2) deformability (LORRCA - elongation index, EI), (3) osmotic fragility (LORRCA - \u0394Osm resilience), (4) aggregation (LORRCA - syllectogram) and (5) vasoregulation (organ chamber bioassay - RBC hypoxic vasodilaton). Mechanistic explanation for the SiRD phenotype was explored by evaluating: (6) Ca + accumulation (flow cytometry), (7) caspase3 activation (flow cytometry), (8) cdB3 proteolysis (western blot), (9) RBC metabolomic analysis ( 13 C 1,2,3 -glucose based MS, +/- exogenous oxidant stress), (10) nitric oxide content (photolysis:chemiluminescence - total RBC NO, FeNO, and SNO content), and (11) eryptosis:phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure (flow cytometry). SiRD physiologic impact was evaluated by (12) quantifying tissue O 2 delivery impairment in vivo (HIF-1a bioluminescent mouse, IVIS). RESULTS: RBCs from septic mice demonstrated the following physiologic \u0394s: (1) \u2191 O 2 affinity (L-shifted HbO 2 dissociation) at 3 pHs (7.2, 7.4, and 7.6, with \u2193 Bohr effect), with \u2191 p50 (G sev vs G cont ) (pH7.2: 47.8\u00b11.2 * vs. 53.3\u00b10.9 Torr; pH7.4: 37.2\u00b11.1 ** vs. 42.9\u00b10.7 Torr; and pH7.6: 29.0\u00b10.6 *** vs. 34.2\u00b10.8 Torr); (2) \u2193 RBC deformability - with similar EI max , shear stress (SS) 1/2 was \u2191 in G sev vs G cont (0.92 vs. 0.65 Pa); (3) \u2191 osmotic fragility - min & max tolerated osmolality (O min & O max ): O min in G cont , G mild , and G sev were 166.1\u00b18.9, 158.8\u00b14.5, and 159.1\u00b12.8 mOsm/kg; and O max were 336.0\u00b121.5, 315.3\u00b19.1, and 314.0\u00b18.5 mOsm/kg, respectively; (4) \u2191 aggregation - syllectogram backscatter intensity (Isc): in G sev , Isc \u2193 from 32.5\u00b15.0 to 12.5\u00b12.8 Au; but in G cont , Isc only changed from 31.1\u00b13.4 to 23.6\u00b14.6 Au; (5) hypoxic vasodilation response \u2193 in G sev RBCs vs G cont (8.9\u00b14.2% vs 10.2\u00b14.0%*, respectively). Exploration of potential mechanisms for SiRD revealed: (6) \u2191 RBC Ca + (Fluo3-based flow cytometry): \u2191 mean florescence intensity (MFI) with sepsis severity (G cont : 61.3\u00b111.6; G mild : 73.4\u00b114.6, and G sev : 105\u00b136.0); (7) MIF of active caspase3 probe (CaspGlow-DEVD-FMK) did not change following CLP; however, after incubation with 0.1mM H 2 O 2 , MIF for G sev \u2191 significantly (G cont : 549.3\u00b128.8 vs. G sev : 3123\u00b1782.2 * ); (8) \u2191 cdB3 proteolysis was observed, G sev > G mild ; (9) principal component and pathway analysis of metabolomic data identified sepsis severity-based constraints in the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway & linked antioxidant systems (NADPH and GSH); (10) RBC SNOHb & membrane SNO \u2193 in G sev vs G cont (0.08 \u00b1 0.04 * & 0.04 \u00b1 0.02 * vs 0.22 \u00b1 0.08 & 0.17 \u00b1 0.07 SNOHb (SNO:Hb molar ratio) and membrane SNO mol/mg protein, respectively; (11) \u2191 %age of eryptotic RBCs after CLP (annexin V-based flow cytometry): G sev annexin V positive sub-population was 5.3\u00b12.9% ** , compared to G cont 1.3\u00b10.6% - following oxidative stress (0.1mM H 2 O 2 ), annexin V positive sub- population in G cont \u2191 further to 11.5\u00b14.1%; whilst G sev , \u2191 to 31.0\u00b19.2% *** . (12) O 2 delivery impairment was quantified by imaging (IVIS) HIF-bioluminescent mice (FVB/Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm2(HIF1A/luc)kael ): D1 normalized luciferase activity in G sev was \u2191 3.4\u00b10.8 * fold vs baseline; a similar difference was observed after washed RBC exchange from G sev \u2192 G cont mice. (NB: * P<0.05; ** P<0.01; *** P<0.001) CONCLUSIONS: In sepsis, RBCs undergo major biochemical & physiologic alterations that impair O 2 delivery, which we term SiRD. We propose SiRD arises from acquired RBC metabolic constraints, oxidative RBC injuries and impaired physiology, comprising a distinct form of organ (RBC) failure that may influence sepsis outcome. This well characterized model will allow further characterization, mechanistic study, and therapeutic exploration.
