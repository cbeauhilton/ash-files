    "abstract_text": "Transcription factor (TF) mutations are increasingly recognized to play a major role in inherited platelet abnormalities. RUNX1, a critical hematopoietic TF, acts in a combinatorial manner with other TFs to regulate numerous megakaryocyte (MK)/platelet genes. Human RUNX1 haplodeficiency is associated with thrombocytopenia, numerous platelet function defects, and increased leukemia risk. We have previously described a patient with a heterozygous RUNX1 nonsense mutation in the conserved runt domain necessary for DNA binding (Sun et al Blood 2004;103;948-54). The patient's platelet abnormalities included impaired aggregation and secretion in response to multiple agonists, granule deficiency, and decreased phosphorylation of myosin light chain and pleckstrin, activation of GPIIb-IIIa, 12-HETE production, and platelet protein kinase C-\u03b8. Transcript expression profiling of patient platelets (Sun et al, J Thromb Haemost 2007;5:146-54) showed numerous genes were significantly downregulated, including myosin light chain ( MYL9 ), platelet factor 4 ( PF4 ), protein kinase C-\u03b8 ( PRCKQ ), and 12-lipoxygenase ( ALOX12) ; these have been shown by us to be regulated by RUNX1. The profiling data also showed 10-fold downregulation of phosphatidylcholine transfer protein ( PCTP ) gene (fold change ratio 0.09, p=0.02) in the patient compared with normal controls. PCTP is a member of the START (Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein-Related Transfer) domain superfamily and is responsible for the intermembrane transfer of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major plasma membrane phospholipid. Several findings indicate that PCTP is important for platelet function. PC is the main fraction of platelet phospholipids and source of arachidonic acid (AA) upon activation. Release of free AA from PC is the rate-limiting step in thromboxane production. PC is also a substrate for phospholipase D, which yields phosphatidic acid that can generate the second messenger diacylglycerol. Importantly, platelet PCTP has recently been demonstrated to have a major role in the racial differences in platelet responses - increased PCTP expression has been linked to the higher platelet aggregation and calcium mobilization induced by thrombin receptor protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) in blacks as compared to whites (Edelstein et al Nat Med 2013;19:1609-16). Little is known regarding the regulation of PCTP in MKs/platelets. Based on the decreased platelet PCTP expression in our patient, we pursued the hypothesis that PCTP is regulated by RUNX1. Corrected total cellular immunofluorescence with anti-PCTP antibody showed significantly reduced platelet PCTP expression by 58% in our patient compared to a normal control. In silico analysis revealed 5 RUNX1 consensus binding sites up to 995 bp of the PCTP 5' upstream region from ATG. To assess for interaction of RUNX1 with the PCTP promoter, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay with anti-RUNX1 antibody was performed using human erythroid leukemia (HEL) cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 24 hours to induce megakaryocytic transformation. The ChIP studies showed RUNX1 binding to PCTP chromatin in the regions encompassing RUNX1 binding sites 1 (-232/-227) and 2 (-345/-340), at site 3 (-519/-514), and encompassing sites 4 and 5 (-861/-856, -884/-879). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using PMA-treated HEL cell nuclear extracts showed RUNX1 binding to DNA probes (28-37 bp) containing site 1 (-232/-227) and both sites 4 and 5 (-861/-856, -884/-879). To assess the effect of modulating RUNX1 expression on PCTP expression, PMA-treated HEL cells were transfected with RUNX1 overexpression plasmid or siRNA. PCTP mRNA and protein expression were increased with RUNX1 overexpression and reduced with RUNX1 knockdown, suggesting that PCTP is regulated by RUNX1. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that PCTP is a direct transcriptional target of and regulated by RUNX1, and a cogent molecular mechanism for downregulation of platelet PCTP in our patient with RUNX1 haplodeficiency. Regulation of PCTP by RUNX1 may be relevant to the platelet dysfunction in RUNX1 haplodeficiency as well as to racial differences in platelet responses linked to the differential platelet expression of PCTP.
