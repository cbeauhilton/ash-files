    "abstract_text": "There is increasing evidence that platelet and leukocyte activation plays an important role in the thrombotic complications of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), but the relationship of both thrombosis occurrence and JAK2 V617F mutation status with the levels of circulating tissue factor (TF) and of soluble markers of platelet and endothelial activation is not known. In 53 ET patients (26 of whom had a previous history of thrombosis), platelet TF expression and plasma levels of TF, soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag), soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), D-dimer, and prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), measured by ELISA, were compared with those in matched healthy individuals and correlated with thrombosis occurrence and JAK2 V617F mutation status. ET patients with thrombosis had significantly higher levels of sP-selectin than patients without thrombosis and the controls, whereas ET patients without thrombosis had significantly higher levels than the controls (99.8 \u00b1 47.1 ng/mL versus 70.6 \u00b1 37.8 ng/mL versus 32.4 \u00b1 11.9 ng/mL; p= 0.0001 for all comparisons). The same applied to sCD40L levels (226.7 \u00b1 104.7 pg/mL in patients with thrombosis, 186.4 \u00b1 92.1 pg/mL in patients without thrombosis, and 81.3 \u00b1 22.0 pg/mL in controls; p= 0.0001 for all comparisons). Circulating VWF:Ag and F1+2 levels were higher in ET patients than in controls, but no significant difference was observed between patients with and without thrombosis. No differences in TF platelet expression, TF and sTM plasma concentrations were found between patients and controls. A positive correlation was observed between sP-selectin and F1+2, a marker of thrombin generation (r= 0.378, p= 0.01). Patients with the JAK2 mutation (22 out of 52 assessable patients), as compared with those with the wild-type allele, had significantly higher levels of sP-selectin (p= 0.002), sCD40L (p= 0.03), TF (p= 0.016), VWF:Ag (p= 0.0001), and sTM (p= 0.032). These results support a role for soluble markers of platelet activation in the thrombosis of ET as well as their potential to identify ET patients at greater risk of thrombosis. The association between JAK2 mutation and increased levels of TF and soluble markers of platelet and endothelial activation would suggest that the mutation could promote an enhanced prethrombotic state in ET.",
