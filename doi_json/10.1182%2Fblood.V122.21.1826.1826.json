    "abstract_text": "Cutaneous lymphoma is a heterogeneous group of neoplasms of skin-homing malignant lymphocytes. Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) represents 70-80% of all cutaneous lymphoma and its pathogenesis is largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that interleukin (IL)-15 is a potent stimulant and growth factor for CTCL cells in vitro . In order to investigate the intrinsic levels of IL-15 in CTCL patients, malignant CD4+ T-cells were analyzed for expression of IL-15. Relative quantitation of IL-15 transcript in patient vs normal donor (ND) CD4+ cells showed overexpression of IL-15 in patients (fold increase mean \u00b1 SD = 5.36 \u00b1 4.39, N=13, P<0.001). Increase in IL-15 transcript was directly proportional to disease severity in patients i.e. fold increase mean \u00b1 SD in IL-15 in Stage I =3.28 \u00b1 1.42, N=3 each, P=0.0047 vs. Stage III patients = 7.42 \u00b1 1.30, N=3 each, P=0.0073. Further, cutaneous lesions in patients stained positive for IL-15 protein in atypical lymphoid cells and Pautrier's microabscess. We next investigated the role of IL-15 in CTCL development using IL-15 transgenic (tg) mice. Within 4-6 weeks of birth, IL-15 tg mice developed extensive patch/plaque skin lesions, progressive alopecia, and severe pruritus. Adult IL-15 tg mice developed extensive involvement with cutaneous lymphoma that was fatal in 100% of the mice (P=0.0003). Antibodies staining revealed that CD4+ skin resident T-cells in IL-15 tg mice were CD3+CD62L-CD44 hi CCR4+CLA+. Flow cytometric analysis of single cell suspension of skin showed \u223c25-fold increase in CD3+ T-cells in IL-15 tg compared to WT controls (Mean \u00b1 SD of absolute number of cells= 3.80 \u00b1 6.97, N=14 vs. 0.15 \u00b1 0.26, N=8 respectively, P<0.001). Lymphoma cells from IL-15 tg mouse skin engrafted and mimicked the primary disease in immune deficient SCID mice upon adoptive transfer. CD4+ T-cells from CTCL patients showed increased histone deacetylases (HDAC) 1, HDAC2 and HDAC6 transcripts over ND CD4+ T-cells and immunoblot analysis of ND CD4+ T-cells exposed to 100ng/ml IL-15 showed upregulation of HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC6 ex vivo . IL-15 stimulation of ND CD4+ T-cells resulted in loss of expression of the downstream HDAC1/2 target tumor suppressor, p21 in vitro , and knock down of HDAC6 in IL-15 stimulated ND CD4+ T-cells inhibited their migration in vitro ; suggesting that IL-15 mediated upregulation of HDAC6 is critical for T-cell migration. Considering these observations, we used specific novel HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) to target HDAC1/2 (JQ12) and/or HDAC6 (WT161) in IL-15 tg mice to determine if we could prevent CTCL in vivo . IL-15 tg mice were treated with 50mg/kg of either or both the inhibitors, 5 days/week for 4 weeks (n=4 each). While placebo treated IL-15 tg mice progressively developed lesions during the course of treatment, IL-15 tg mice treated with JQ12 and/or WT161 showed no clinical signs of disease. This was further corroborated by histopathology analysis of skin sections from treated mice ( Figure 1 ). Thus, our data suggest that inhibiting HDAC1, HDAC2 and/or HDAC6 pathways inhibits the development of CTCL in IL-15tg mice. In addition to the prevention study, we assessed the ability of a novel pan-HDACi, AR42, to treat active and progressive disease in our model. IL-15 tg mice with established CTCL were randomized to receive either AR42 or placebo feed (n=6 each) for 12 days. The IL-15 tg mice treated with AR42 showed remarkable improvement compared to the placebo mice whose disease progressed. Histopathology analysis of the AR42-treated IL-15 tg mice showed an impressive clearance of the CD3+ and CD4+ atypical lymphocytic infiltrate compared to placebo-treated mice ( Figure 2 ). In summary we provide evidence that IL-15 has a causal role in the pathogenesis of CTCL; that IL-15 tg mice provide a novel model for studying disease pathogenesis and for evaluating potential therapies; that HDACi targeting specific HDACs may be effective in preventing CTCL and a novel pan-HDACi can reverse severe dermatologic disease in this CTCL model.
