    "abstract_text": "Background: In November, 2013 obinutuzumab (obin) was approved in combination with chlorambucil (chlor), as 1 st line therapy (Rx) for patients (pts) with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In February, 2014, ibrutinib was approved in CLL for pts who had received > 1 prior therapy. In April, 2014 ofatumumab (ofa) + chlor was approved as 1 st line Rx for pts with CLL for whom fludarabine-based therapy is considered inappropriate. During 2014 we studied PPrefs of 180 U.S-based hematology-oncology physicians (HOPs) for 1 st line Rx across a range of clinical scenarios varying by age, co-morbidities, and selected laboratory features. Methods: PPrefs were assessed through a validated, proprietary, live, case-based market research tool (Challenging Cases\u00ae). Assessment dates were 3/08/14 and 4/26/14. Data were acquired using blinded, audience-response technology. A core scenario (CS) and 3 variant scenarios (VS) were utilized to evoke physician PPrefs. CS: 63-year-old male; 1-2 cm diffuse adenopathy, spleen 3 cm below costal margin. Presented with recent fatigue/ low grade fevers; no relevant co-morbidities; CD 38=12%. No FISH abnormalities. PS1. VS1: All equal except 17p deletion and CD 38 = 42%; VS2: CS (age 63; no abnormal FISH) plus co-morbidities (medication-controlled hypertension, type II diabetes, and mild COPD); VS3: VS2 BUT age 73 with same co-morbidities. Results: PPrefs by scenario shown below: Abstract 4676. Table 1  PPref . CS . VS1 . VS2 .

In VS1 (age 63; 17p deletion) ibrutinib based Rx is emerging despite lack of 1 st line indication. In VS 3 (age 73, multiple co-morbidities present, neither high risk FISH nor CD 38 positivity) 1 st line PPref for Chlor + Obin is emerging. Prior to ASH 2014, we will assess PPrefs of approximately 180 additional HOPs related to these scenarios (with ofatumumab + chlorambucil added as a treatment option) and have aggregate PPref data (N > 350) across all of 2014 for ASH.
