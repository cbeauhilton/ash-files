    "abstract_text": "Abstract 878 Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a human genomic instability disorder characterized by progressive bone marrow failure, congenital abnormalities and high predisposition to cancer. Bone marrow failure in FA children is attributed partly to the excessive apoptosis and subsequent failure of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment. Understanding the mechanisms of bone marrow failure may allow better diagnosis and treatment for FA and other aplastic anemia patients. There are fourteen known Fanconi Anemia genes (A, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G, I, J, L, M, N, O). The FA pathway, regulated by these FA gene products, mediates DNA repair and promotes normal cellular resistance to DNA crosslinking agents. Recent studies suggest that besides maintaining genomic stability, the FA pathway may also play a role in mitosis since FANCD2 and FANCI, the two key FA proteins, are localized to the extremities of ultra-fine DNA bridges (UFBs) linking sister chromatids during cell division (Chan et al, Nat Cell Biol, 11:753-760, 2009; Naim and Rosselli, Nat Cell Biol, 11:761-768, 2009). Whether FA proteins play a direct role in cell division is still unclear. To dissect the mechanisms of bone marrow failure in FA, we have investigated the requirement of FA pathway during mitosis. Initially, we investigated the number of DNA bridges occurring during mitosis in FA-deficient and proficient cells by immunofluorescence and Hoechst staining. FA-deficient patient cell lines (FANCG-deficient and FANCD1/BRCA2-deficient cells) as well as Hela cells with shRNA-mediated knockdown of the FA pathway, displayed an increase in UFBs compared to the FA proficient cells during mitosis. The UFBs were coated by BLM (the RecQ helicase mutated in Bloom syndrome) in early mitosis. In contrast, the FA protein, FANCM, was recruited to the bridges at a later stage. Since the DNA bridges occluding the cleavage furrow potentially induce cytokinesis failure, we assessed FA-deficient cells for multinucleation. The increased number of DNA bridges correlated with a higher rate of binucleated cells in FA deficient Hela cell lines and FA patient-derived fibroblast cells. Moreover, an increase in binucleated cells was also detectable in FA-deficient primary murine bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (Fancd2-/- cells and Fancg-/- cells) compared to the wild-type cells undergoing proliferation and in FA patient-derived bone marrow stroma cells compared to the stroma cells from normal human bone marrow. Interestingly, the increase in binucleated cells in FA-deficient murine hematopoietic stem cells correlated with the increase in apoptotic cells. Binuclearity, scored by immunostaining for microtubules and Hoechst staining for DNA, was the result of cytokinesis failure as observed by live cell imaging. Therefore, we investigated whether the FA-deficient cells are sensitive to the cytokinesis inhibitors. FA-deficient murine bone marrow lineage negative cells (Fancd2-/- cells) or FA human fibroblast cells were exposed to VX-680 (an inhibitor of Aurora kinases regulating cytokinesis) in culture for 72 hrs and cell survival was assessed. VX-680 caused increased toxicity (reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis) on FA-deficient cells in comparison to the wild-type cells. Enhanced inhibition of clonogenic growth of murine FA-deficient bone marrow cells (Fancd2-/- cells) compared to the wild-type cells was also observed by exposure to VX-680. These data indicated that FA pathway-deficient hematopoietic cells are hypersensitive to cytokinesis inhibitors. Collectively, our results underscore the importance of the FA pathway in mitosis and suggest that the cytokinesis failure observed in FA deficient hematopoietic cells could contribute to bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia patients.
