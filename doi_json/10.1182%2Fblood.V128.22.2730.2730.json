    "abstract_text": "Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are capable of limitless self-renewal and indefinitely propagating leukemia. Eradication of LSCs is the ultimate goal of treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using a mouse model of AML induced by the MLL-fusion protein MLL-AF9, we recently showed that the combined loss of Runx1/Cbfb inhibited the development of leukemia in vivo (Goyama S\u2026Mulloy JC. Transcription factor RUNX1 promotes survival of acute myeloid leukemia cells. Journal of Clinical Investigation 123(9): 3876-3888, 2013). However, LSC-enriched cells with immature surface phenotype (cKit + Gr1 - ) remained viable in Runx1/Cbfb -deleted MLL-AF9 cells, indicating that RUNX targeting may not eradicate the most immature LSCs. Gene expression analyses of Runx1/Cbfb -deleted MLL-AF9 cells revealed the upregulation of thrombin pathway genes including a thrombin-activatable receptor PAR-1. Interestingly, both overexpression and knockout of PAR-1 inhibit leukemogenesis but do so through distinct mechanisms. Similar to the effect of Runx1/Cbfb-depletion, PAR-1 overexpression induced p21 expression and attenuated proliferation in MLL-AF9 cells. To our surprise, PAR-1-deficiency also prevented leukemia development induced by a small number of MLL-AF9 LSCs in vivo . Re-expression of PAR-1 in PAR-1 -deficient cells combined with a limiting-dilution transplantation assay demonstrated the cell-dose dependent role of PAR-1 in MLL-AF9 leukemia: PAR-1 inhibited rapid leukemic proliferation when there are a large number of LSCs, while a small numbers of LSCs required PAR-1 for their growth. Mechanistically, PAR-1 increased adhering properties of MLL-AF9 cells and promoted their engraftment to bone marrow. PAR-1-deficiency also reduced leukemogenicity of AML1-ETO-induced leukemia. Together, these data reveal a multifaceted role for PAR-1 in leukemogenesis, and highlight this receptor as a potential target to eradicate primitive LSCs in AML.
