    "abstract_text": "While the use of rituximab in combination with chemotherapy resulted in an improved survival among various subtypes of B-cell lymphomas, a significant number of patients fail to respond or relapse as a consequence of intrinsic or acquired resistance. A change in CD20 antigen density expression is a potential mechanism to explain rituximab resistance. Moreover, several groups of investigators are focused in understanding the mechanisms that regulate CD20 expression and to develop therapeutic strategies to up-regulate CD20 expression (i.e. IL-4, GM-CSF or Bryostatin-1). Up-regulation of CD20 in DB and Ramos cells by Bryostatin-1 was found to be PKC and Erk dependent. In an attempt to characterize the mechanisms responsible for rituximab resistance we developed several RRCL derived from rituximab-sensitive RL and Raji cells. We have demonstrated a significant down-regulation of CD20mRNA and CD20 surface antigen in RRCL when compared to RSCL. In our present work we evaluated the mechanisms involved in the mRNA down-regulation of CD20 and the potential of IL-4 and Bryostatin-1 in modulating CD20 antigen expression among a panel of RRCL. To this end, RSCL and RRCL were treated with either 5ng/ml of IL-4 or 3 different doses of Bryostatin-1(1, 3 or 5ng/ml). Nuclear and cytosolic extract were also obtained from RSCL RL and RRCL RL-4RH after 24, 48 and 74 hrs exposure to IL-4 (5ng/ml) or control. Differences in the expression of key regulatory transcription factors for B-cell lymphocyte development (PU.1, Oct-2, Pax5, E2A and EBF) were studied by Western Blotting. Previously, we found a significant down-regulation of CD20 antigen in the RRCL. An up-regulation of cytosolic and surface CD20 was detected in RRCL exposed to either IL-4 or Bryostatin by western blotting and flow cytometric analysis. Besides, a higher expression of Pax5, PU.1, EBF was found in nuclear fractions of RRCL when compared to RSCL. In vitro exposure of RRCL to IL-4 decreases the expression of PU.1, Oct-2, Pax5 and EBF in nuclear extracts from RSCL or RRCL when compared with controls treated cells. Our data suggest that rituximab resistance is associated with the up-regulation of transcription factors PU.1, Oct-2, Pax5 and EBF and concomitant suppression of CD20 antigen. Future study of how these agents induce CD20 expression in RRCL will provide a potential means to reversing resistance towards rituximab treatment."
