    "abstract_text": "Precise spatial and temporal control of actin polymerization and depolymerization is essential for mediating various cellular processes such as migration, phagocytosis, vesicle trafficking and adhesion. In this study, we used a small-molecule functional screening approach to identify novel regulators of actin dynamics during neutrophil migration. Here we show that NADPH-oxidase dependent Reactive Oxygen Species act as negative regulators of actin polymerization. Neutrophils with pharmacologically inhibited oxidase or isolated from Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) patient and mice displayed enhanced F-actin polymerization, multiple pseudopods formation and impaired chemotaxis. ROS localized to pseudopodia and inhibited actin polymerization by driving actin glutathionylation at the leading edge of migrating cells. Consistent with these in vitro results, adoptively transferred CGD murine neutrophils also showed impaired in vivo recruitment to sites of inflammation. Together, these results present a novel physiological role for ROS in regulation of action polymerization and shed new light on the pathogenesis of CGD.",
