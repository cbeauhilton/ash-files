    "abstract_text": "We have characterized and reported the immunostimulating properties of a novel polysaccharide - (1,4)-\u03b1-D-glucan (RR1)- isolated from the medicinal plant Tinospora cordifolia [23]. This novel glucan is water soluble and having (1, 4)-\u03b1-D-glycosidic linkages in the main chain and (1, 6)-\u03b1-D-glycosidic linked side chains at an interval of 6, 7 glucose units. The signaling mechanism of the novel (1,4)-a-D-glucan (RR1) was investigated in macrophages to evaluate its immunostimulating properties. When RAW264.7 macrophages were incubated with RR1 at 4\u00b0C, the novel glucan inhibited the phagocytosis of unopsonized zymosan A bioparticles in a dose-dependent manner. RR1 also inhibited the binding and internalization of opsonized zymosan A bioparticles, although at a lower level than laminarin. Incubation of macrophages with anti-CD11b mAb followed by RR1 failed to show any inhibitory effect on RR1-induced TNF-\u03b1 synthesis confirming that complement receptor 3 (CR3) is not involved in the opsonic binding and internalization of RR1 in macrophages unlike zymosan A. The anti-CD11b mAb has significant inhibitory effect on the zymosan A-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 synthesis. RR1 induced TNF-\u03b1 synthesis in macrophages in a dose-dependent manner which can be completely inhibited by the NF-\u03baB inhibitor caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) or curcumin. RR1 activated NF-\u03baB in a time- and dose-dependent manner and this modulation of nuclear NF-\u03baB activity is associated with the degradation of I-\u03baB a thus facilitating the translocation of NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. RR1-induced NF-\u03baB activity peaks at 8 h of RR1 stimulation while I-\u03baB a degradation occurred within 1 h of stimulation. RR1-induced NF-\u03baB activation occurred through TLR6 signaling as evidenced by the synthesis of IL-8 in TLR6-transfected HEK293 cells. These results show that the novel (1,4)-\u03b1-D glucan from Tinospora cordifolia activates the immune system through the activation of macrophages that occurs through TLR6 signaling, NF-\u03baB translocation and cytokine production.
