We compared the outcomes of therapy-related AML (t-AML), AML following myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS-AML) and AML following myeloproliferative disorder (MPD-AML). We also intended to find prognostic factors in s-AML overall. Retrospective medical record review at Seoul National University Hospital was performed. We assessed response to induction chemotherapy and overall survival (OS). 95 s-AML patients (median age 56.4 years) were analyzed. 26, 57 and 12 patients had t-AML, MDS-AML and MPD-AML respectively. For patients receiving induction chemotherapy, complete remission (CR) rate was 47.5% and CR rate was different according to the type of the preceding disorders (p=0.004). Compared to t-AML (p=0.027) and MDS-AML (p=0.050), MPD-AML had shorter OS. In s-AML, presence of trisomy 8 had a prognostic impact (p=0.003) along with cytogenetic risk group (p=0.016). In multivariate analysis, the type of the preceding disorders (p=0.026), 5q deletion (p=0.015) and trisomy 8 (p=0.040) were independent prognostic factors. In conclusion, prognosis of s-AML was different according to the type of the preceding disorders with the worst prognosis in MPD-AML. Along with cytogenetic risk grouping, trisomy 8 had a prognostic impact in s-AML. Table 1 Characteristics of s-AML patients according to preceding disorders Characteristics . t-AML . AML-MDS .
