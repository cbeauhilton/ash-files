    "abstract_text": "Autoimmune phenomena, particularly directed against RBC, and alteration of apoptosis have been reported in MDS. We recently described a new method for the detection of anti-RBC antibodies in mitogen-stimulated whole blood cultures, named mitogen-stimulated-DAT (MS-DAT), which is able to disclose a latent anti-RBC autoimmunity in different diseases (autoimmune hemolytic anemia in clinical remission and in B-CLL). We investigated MS-DAT positivity and apoptosis in peripheral blood and bone marrow cultures from 14 patients with refractory anemia (RA) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), compared with controls (healthy volunteers and miscellaneous haematological conditions). MS-DAT was performed by stimulating whole blood and marrow cultures with PMA, and anti-RBC or anti-erythroblast antibodies were detected by competitive solid phase ELISA. As apoptotic markers we evaluated NF-kB and Caspase-3 activity by ELISA and enzymatic assay, respectively. As shown in table, the amount of anti-erythroblast antibodies was significantly greater in BM cultures of MDS versus controls, and the test was clearly positive in 8/14 patients (not shown). The anti-apoptotic marker NF-kB was significantly increased in MDS versus controls, and consistently, caspase-3 activity decreased, although not significantly. On the contrary, PB of MDS displayed no MS-DAT positivity and no significant alterations of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic markers investigated (not shown). These findings suggest the existence of an anti-erythroblast autoimmunity in bone marrow of early MDS patients. This could be related to the observed defective apoptosis, which in turn determines survival of auto-reactive marrow effectors.  . MDS . Controls . . Medium . PMA . Medium .
