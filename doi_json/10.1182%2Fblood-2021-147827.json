    "abstract_text": "Introduction CMML is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder with overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Current therapeutic options for patients (pts) with CMML are limited, leaving a significant unmet medical need. Pts classified to have the MPN subtype, compared with the MDS subtype, and those with high-risk genetic features tend to have a higher rate of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and median survival of 2-3 years. The seminal observation of increased expression of CD123 (interleukin-3R\u03b1) on leukemia stem cells and clonal plasmacytoid dendritic cells led to the clinical investigation of a novel CD123-targeted agent, tagraxofusp (TAG, SL-401), in CD123-positive hematologic malignancies, including blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), CMML, AML, and myelofibrosis. TAG demonstrated robust clinical activity in pts with BPDCN and is now approved in the US and EU for this indication. Data from an ongoing phase 1/2 study of TAG monotherapy for pts with relapsed/refractory (R/R) CMML (NCT02268253) also demonstrated clinical activity (Patnaik et al. J Clin Oncol 2019;37: abstr 7059). Herein, we present updated safety and efficacy results of this study in first-line (1L) high-risk and R/R pts. Methods A multicenter, multistage, phase 1/2 trial was designed initially to assess the safety and efficacy of TAG monotherapy in adult pts with R/R CMML (Stages 1 and 2), and subsequently expanded to include 1L high-risk and R/R pts (Stage 3A). Clinical responses were initially assessed by the International Working Group/MDS 2006 criteria, and subsequently amended to the MDS/MPN 2015 criteria. Splenomegaly was assessed by palpation in Stages 1 and 2, and by palpation and imaging in Stage 3A. TAG was administered as a daily IV infusion at 7, 9, or 12 mcg/kg on days (d)1-3 every 21 d (cycles [C]1-4), 28 d (C5-7), and 42 d (C8 and beyond) in Stage 1, and at 12 mcg/kg (recommended phase 2 dose defined in Stage 1) every 21 d (C1-4) and 28 d (C5 and beyond) in Stages 2-3A. Results As of July 2021, 36 pts have been enrolled, comprising 20 pts with CMML-1 and 16 with CMML-2; median age is 69 years (range 42-81); 75% are male. Twenty-three (64%) pts had either high- or intermediate-risk genetics based on CPSS, GFM, MMM, or ELN risk-stratification systems. Prior therapies included HMA in 16 (43%) pts, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in 3 (8%), and other in 12 (32%); 7 (19%) pts were high-risk and treatment naive. Overall, 16 (44%) pts had baseline palpable splenomegaly, of whom 12 pts' spleen size was \u22655 cm below left costal margin. The most common (in \u226520% of pts, n=34) treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were hypoalbuminemia (26%), thrombocytopenia (24%), nausea (24%), and capillary leak syndrome (CLS, 21%; grade 2, n=4; grade 3, n=3). Grade \u22653 TRAEs were thrombocytopenia (21%), CLS (9%), anemia (9%), and nausea (3%). Discontinuation rate due to TRAEs was low (n=1). Overall, 4 of 36 (11%) pts achieved bone marrow morphologic complete responses (BMCRs), of whom 1 pt was bridged to allo-SCT; all 4 pts had splenomegaly at baseline. Noteworthy, 2 of the 4 BMCRs were observed in pts with high-risk genetic features. Fifteen (42%) pts with baseline splenomegaly had spleen responses; 9 (60%) pts had a \u226550% reduction in spleen size, including 5 (42%) with splenomegaly \u22655 cm at baseline. Median follow-up was 11 weeks (range 1-163 weeks). In the Stage 3A cohort, 2 high-risk 1L pts had BM partial remissions, with 1 also having clinical benefit. Three pts had a spleen volume reduction by MRI scans following C1 (range 7%-36%) and 1 pt had a reduction of 57% after C4. While on study, none of the 7 pts (2 transfusion dependent at baseline) have required blood or platelet transfusions. Updated results on Stage 3A, including total symptom scores, will be presented. Conclusions Ongoing results in pts with CMML demonstrate TAG monotherapy has significant clinical activity in 1L pts with high-risk disease as well as those with R/R disease. The responses were particularly notable in those with baseline splenomegaly. As Stage 3A of the trial continues, mutational correlates and BM PDCs are being assessed. TAG treatment is well-tolerated, with a manageable and predictable safety profile. Overall, the data suggest that TAG may offer a novel targeted approach for pts with CMML. Stage 3A of the trial continues.
