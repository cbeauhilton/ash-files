Methods NK cells were isolated from PBMNC by using miniMACS (Magnetic cell-selection) and NK Cell Isolation Kit II(Miltenyi Biotec, Germany), then they were cultured in SCEM (Stemline Hematopoietic Stem Cell Expansion Medium, Sigma) supplemented with 10% human AB serum and different combinations of interleukin (IL)-2 and/or IL-12, IL-15 for 15 days. Cultures were fed with fresh media and cytokines every 3 days, and were evaluated for cell expansion, phenotype, perforin and granzyme B mRNA expressions, and IFN-\u03b3 secretion at the end of the culture period. Results In group IL2+IL15 and IL2+IL15+IL12, cells were expanded 50.46\u00b14.31 and 52.35\u00b16.72 fold, respectively, much more higher than others( P <0.01), but no significant difference between them ( P>0.05 ). And the purity of CD3 \u2212 CD56 + NK cells was over 94% in all groups except the control. The expressions of perforin and granzyme B mRNA of expanded NK cells cultured with cytokines was significantly higher than the starting population( P <0.01), although IL2+IL15+IL12 group was slightly higher than that of IL2+IL15 group, without significant difference ( P>0.05 ). There was great increase in IFN-\u03b3 levels in the supernatants of NK cells culture in the presence of cytokines; IL2+IL15+IL12 group and IL2+IL12 group was significantly higher than others( P <0.01). Conclusion High purity NK cells could be efficiently expanded in culture with IL2+IL15, and its biological functions were enhanced in this condition.
