    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2195 Platelet glycoprotein (GP)Ib-IX receptor complex contains three subunits, GPIb\u03b1, GPIb\u03b2 and GPIX, which assemble with a ratio of 1:2:1. Dysfunction in surface expression of the complex leads to Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS). We have crystallized the GPIb\u03b2 ectodomain (GPIb\u03b2 E ) and determined the structure to reveal a single leucine-rich repeat with N- and C-terminal disulfide bonded capping regions. The central region of the structure can be divided into concave parallel \u03b2-sheet and convex loops. The crystal structure of a GPIb\u03b2 E /GPIX E chimera that contains three non-continguous convex loops of GPIX and retains a GPIb\u03b2-binding site of GPIX (Mo et al. J. Thromb. Haemost. 7:1533\u201340, 2009) was also determined. The chimera, but not GPIb\u03b2 E , forms a homotetramer in the crystal, revealing a quaternary interface between GPIb\u03b2 and GPIX ectodomains. Central to this interface is residue Tyr106 from GPIb\u03b2 that inserts into a shallow and largely hydrophobic pocket generated by two convex loops from GPIX. Mutagenesis studies confirmed this interface as a valid representation of interactions between GPIb\u03b2 and GPIX in the full-length complex. Eight GPIb\u03b2 missense mutations identified from BSS patients were examined in transiently transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells for changes to the GPIb-IX complex surface expression. Six of the eight mutations lead to secretion defect and/or misfolding of GPIb\u03b2 E . In contrast, the other two mutations, A108P and P74R, were found to maintain normal secretion and folding of GPIb\u03b2 E but were unable to support GPIX surface expression. The close structural proximity of these mutations to Tyr106 and the GPIb\u03b2 E interface with GPIX indicates that residues Ala108 and Pro74 in GPIb\u03b2 are located at the GPIb\u03b2 E /GPIX E interfaces. Based on the tetrameric arrangement of the chimera structure, we propose a structural model for the GPIb-IX complex that embodies its organizing principles and helps to provide mechanistic insights on its assembly, function and regulation.
