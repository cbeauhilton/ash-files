    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2320 Poster Board II-297 In 1996, we initiated a multicenter prospective trial where patients aged under 56 with newly diagnosed symptomatic MM were randomly assigned up-front to receive either a single HDT (HDT1) or two sequential HDT (HDT2). In addition, all patients were independently randomized to be transplanted with unselected ABSC (unselected arm) or CD34-enriched ABSC (CD34 arm). We presented here updated data of this factorial 2*2 design trial, based on a median follow-up of 123 months.In all cases, patients first received one or 2 courses of high dose steroid containing regimens and ABSC were thereafter mobilized by cytoxan (CTX) (4 g/m2) and lenograstim (10 mg/kg/d). When appropriate (CD34 arm), part of collected ABSC were selected using the Isolex\u00ae300i system. The selection procedure resulted in a median purity of 95% (65-100) and in a more than two log tumor cell depletion. In the HDT1 arm, HDT was preceded by 3 monthly courses of a VAD-like regimen and combined a multi-drug regimen (carmustine, etoposide, melphalan 140 mg/m2 (MLP 140) and CTX 60 mg/kg) with a TBI (12 grays in 6 fractions). Patients treated in the HDT2 arm received MLP 140 alone (always supported by unselected ABSC) followed 2 to 3 months later by a second MLP 140 combined with etoposide (30 mg/kg) and 12-gray TBI. In both arms, TBI including HDT were supported with unselected or CD34 enriched ABSC. Two hundred and twenty-five patients were included in the study. Baseline characteristics of the four groups were close. All analyses were performed in intent to treat basis. In HDT groups, treatment completion rates were satisfactory, with 6/112 transplants not performed in the HDT1 group (allotransplant n=1, refusal n=1, mobilisation failure n=1, early death due to disease progression n=3) and 9/113 second transplant not performed in the HDT2 group (allotransplant n=2, mobilisation failure n=3, relapse post first transplant n=1, early death due to disease progression n=3). In the HDT1 and HDT2 groups, median time to TBI-including transplant was 4 months and 4.5 months, respectively.Present analysis did not show any significant difference in terms of early mortality, disease response and outcome of patients included in the two HDT groups. Early death rates (within 9 months post randomization, including toxic deaths and fatal progressive diseases) were 12% and 7% in the HDT1 and the HDT2 arms, respectively. At one year post-randomization, 32 (35 %) patients in the HDT1 and 32 (37 %) patients in the HDT2 groups were still in unmaintained CR or VGPR. The 2 OS curves were not statistically different (p= 0.60 by the log rank test), neither the EFS curves (p= 0.61). There was no significant interaction between selection CD34 and HDT in terms of outcomes. There was no evidence for benefit of CD34 selection as compared to the use of unselected ABSC. Of note, in the CD34 selected group, incidence of severe infections was increased. In conclusion, with a 10-years median follow-up, results of this randomized trial did not show any significant benefit of single HDT versus tandem HDT.
