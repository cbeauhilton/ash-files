    "abstract_text": "Between September 1998 and June 2004, 15 young infants, 50% donor chimerism. Two patients died 3 and 5 years post transplant from respiratory failure (1 patient with MPS II and incomplete chimerism) and progressive Tay Sachs Disease, respectively. Grafts were mismatched at 1 (n = 8) or 2 (n = 7) HLA loci and 8/15 donor/recipient pairs were ABO mismatched. Nine patients developed mild to moderate acute GvHD. Within 6\u201310 months of transplant, six of the 15 patients developed autoimmune cytopenias (autoimmune hemolytic anemia +/\u2212 ITP), diagnosed clinically by Coombs positivity and antiplatelet antibodies respectively. They required therapy with steroids, imuran, dacluzimab, rituximab, and in one patient, splenectomy. There was no correlation with ABO or HLA matching or GvHD and the incidence of autoimmune disease. All patients recovered within 3\u201324 months. Eight of the 15 newborns developed concentric cardiomyopathy while on solumedrol and either cyclosporine or FK506 for GvHD treatment and/or prophylaxis. One patient required intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation. The others remained relatively asymptomatic. Over time and with weaning of steroid therapy, their left ventricular hypertrophy resolved and heart function returned to normal. Both autoimmune cytopenias and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy occur in higher frequency in very young infants undergoing unrelated donor umbilical cord blood transplantation. The etiology of the autoimmune disease is not currently known while the cardiac disease is a result of therapies used to treat and prophylax against GvHD.",
