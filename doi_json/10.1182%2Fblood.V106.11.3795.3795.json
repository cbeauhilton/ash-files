    "abstract_text": "Aim: To study allosensitization in our sickle cell disease (SCD) patients before and after instituting the practice of transfusing C, E, K blood type negative (CEKneg) packed red blood cell (pRBC) units. Material and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed blood bank records of all SCD patients that were transfused pRBCs since 1990 to date. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi square test and Fischer\u2019s exact test. Results: See table 1. Table I: General data of various patient groups  Major patient groups .

Once allosensitized, there was an sustained \u2191 chance of developing a 2nd (& later) AB (50% Vs 31% for first timers) with fewer Tn (usually 30 pRBCs). Patients receiving CEK matched pRBCs developed non-CEK ABs at 2\u00bd times lower frequency than the corresponding group of patients. It was found that the technologist required 30 more minutes and $153 extra in reagent costs for this extended CEK match. Most Rh negative pRBC units were also CEKneg. 90% of our donors are Caucasian. Conclusions: This study showed that utilizing CEK negative pRBCs dramatically \u2193 alloAB(p<0.01) formation in our SCD patients, including C, E, and K and other minor blood group antigens. Patients transfused without C, E, K antigen match developed ABs to C, E, K, and other antigens. In some patients, allosensitization possibly activates the immune system into a hyperactive state leading to further, earlier, multiple and simultaneous alloAB and autoAB formation. Though unlikely, Rh negative and CEKneg pRBCs may also be negative for other minor antigens. Extended antigen matching made it easier to find proper blood units due to less formation of alloABs. However, it resulted in overuse of Rh negative pRBCs and effort to find CEKneg pRBCs for every transfusion.",
