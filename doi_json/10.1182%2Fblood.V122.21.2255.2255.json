    "abstract_text": "Introduction Left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) wall motion abnormalities can be detected through a qualitative analysis of cine magnetic resonance (MR) images. Moreover, MR is the gold standard technique for the evaluation of myocardial iron overload (MIO), biventricular global systolic function and myocardial fibrosis. We investigated the relationships between LV movement abnormalities and MIO, LV function and myocardial fibrosis as well as between RV motion and function in thalassemia major (TM) patients. Methods CMR was performed in 1092 TM patients (537 male; 30.6\u00b18.5 years) enrolled in the Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassemia Network. Cine images were acquired to evaluate wall motion and to quantify biventricular volumes and ejection fraction (EF). For MIO assessment, a T2* multislice approach was used. To detect myocardial fibrosis, late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) images were acquired. For the LV the 16-segment model of the AHA/ACC was taken into account during image analysis: wall motion, T2* value and presence/absence of enhancing area were evaluated for each segment. Results Abnormal motion of LV was found in 66 (6%) patients (60 hypokinetic and 6 dyskinetic). Table 1 shows the comparison between TM patients with normal and abnormal LV motion. Patients with abnormal LV motion were older and had significantly lower global T2* value and significantly higher number of segments with T2*<20 ms. Left volumes and mass indexed by body surface area were significantly higher in patients with abnormal LV motion while the EF was significantly lower. LGE areas were detected in 196 patients (18%) and were predominantly located in the mid-ventricular septum. There was a significant correlation between LGE and abnormal LV motion. Table 1  .

Table 2 shows the comparison between TM patients with normal and abnormal RV motion. Patients with abnormal RV motion were older and they were more frequently males.

Seventeen patients showed movement abnormalities in both ventricles. Conclusions Movement abnormalities in the left ventricle were not really frequent in TM patients but were associated with age, MIO, LV dilation and dysfunction, and myocardial fibrosis. Movement abnormalities in the right ventricle were less frequent compared to the left ventricle, but were associated with age, sex , RV dilation and dysfunction.
