    "abstract_text": "Background : Patients with systemic light-chain (AL) amyloidosis have a high symptom burden which can negatively impact their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, there is a lack of data on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in this population in the current era of effective plasma cell directed therapies. The primary objectives of our study were to assess baseline HRQoL using FACT-G (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General) and PROMIS-GH (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Global Health), evaluate the degree of correlation between FACT-G and PROMIS-GH, and compare HRQoL by hematologic response to first-line therapy in systemic AL amyloidosis. Method : This was an observational study using the Cleveland Clinic Knowledge Program database, which contains HRQoL data captured at outpatient visits. FACT-G was administered every 90 days since its implementation on September 2012. PROMIS-GH was implemented in October 2015, initially administered every 30 days and subsequently every 90 days since July 2017. Results : A total of 81 patients with systemic AL amyloidosis diagnosed between September 2012 and December 2017 and \u22651 HRQoL measurement were included in our analysis. The median age at diagnosis was 64 years. Cardiac involvement at diagnosis was present in 49% of patients. The most common induction therapy was Bortezomib-Cyclophosphamide-Dexamethasone (86%). Autologous stem cell transplantation was performed in 38% of patients. Data on HRQoL at baseline (\u22642 months from diagnosis) using FACT-G was available for 43 patients. The mean FACT-G total score at baseline was 74 (standard deviation [S.D.] \u00b115). In comparison, the mean FACT-G total score for general US population is 80.1 (\u00b118.1) and that of US cancer patients is 79.3 (\u00b117.0) [Normative data from Pearman et al; Cancer. 2014]. Maximal HRQoL deficit was seen in the functional well-being (FWB) domain of FACT-G, with the mean score being >0.5 S.D. below that of the general population (Table 1). Data on HRQoL at baseline using PROMIS-GH was available for 18 patients. There was a significant deficit in global physical health (GPH) compared to the general population, with a mean T-score of 37.7 (\u00b17.8) [Mean T-score in general US population being 50\u00b110]. The mean T-score for global mental health (GMH) was 44.4 (\u00b16.7). A total of 72 patients had 128 outpatient visits where FACT-G and PROMIS-GH were captured concurrently (range, 1-4 visits per patient). Using Cohen's criterion, GPH domain of PROMIS-GH had a large and statistically significant correlation with FACT-G total (r=0.66), physical well being (PWB) (r=0.77) and FWB (r=0.66) scores. PROMIS GMH domain also had a strong and statistically significant correlation with FACT-G total (r=0.73), PWB (r=0.60), emotional well-being (EWB) (r=0.64) and FWB (r=0.73) scores. The scatterplots for correlation between PROMIS-GH domains and FACT-G total score is shown in Figure I. At follow-up, a total of 50 patients had data on best hematologic response and HRQoL assessment. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) to first-line therapy had a significantly superior FACT-G score at all domains compared to those with less than CR or no response. Maximal benefit in complete responders was noted in the FWB domain of FACT-G (Mean score \u22652 S.D. higher than patients with less than CR or no response; P =0.002). Conclusion : Patients with AL amyloidosis have a worse HRQoL at diagnosis compared to US cancer and general adult population. Deficit in HRQoL was most prominent in the FWB domain of FACT-G and GPH domain of PROMIS-GH. Most domains of FACT-G and PROMIS-GH had strong and significant correlation. Patients achieving a CR to first-line therapy had significantly superior HRQoL at all FACT-G domains. Clinical trials in AL amyloidosis should include patient-reported HRQoL as a key endpoint and focus on the domains of physical health and functioning to assess meaningful benefit of novel therapies. Psychometric validation of FACT-G and PROMIS-GH in AL amyloidosis would be helpful in generating robust PRO data in future studies.
