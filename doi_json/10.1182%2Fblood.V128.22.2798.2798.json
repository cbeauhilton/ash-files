    "abstract_text": "Background: Myeloid sarcoma is a tumor mass consisting of myeloid blasts occurring at anatomical site other than the bone marrow ( Arber et al. Blood 2016;127(20):2391-2405 ). It is a subgroup of acute myeloid leukemia, which can be localized or disseminated and may involve multiple organs. It can present with or without a positive bone marrow. It may precede or follow bone marrow involvement. It may be identified at diagnosis or relapse, and is not uncommon after stem cell transplantation ( Koc et al. Cancer 1999;85(3):608-615; Yoshihara et al. Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant 2012;18(12):1800-1807 ). Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics, cytogenetics, prognosis and outcome of patients with myeloid sarcoma with or without bone marrow involvement. Methods: The Mayo Clinic database was interrogated using the ICD-9 codes 205.0, 205.2, 205.3, as well as terms \"myeloid sarcoma,\" \"chloroma,\" and \"extramedullary sarcoma\" in clinical notes and pathology reports. Patients' follow up information was collected until July 2016. Results: Ninety six patients with a diagnosis myeloid sarcoma were identified. The diagnosis was based on biopsy results and in some cases imaging studies in addition to bone marrow biopsy. The median age was 53 (range 17-83) years, and 64 (67%) patients were males. Myeloid sarcoma with de novo (primary) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (with antecedent hematologic malignancy and therapy related) accounted for 64% (61) and 36% of the cases respectively. The sites involved based on their frequency of occurrence included integumentary system (skin and soft tissues) in 37 (38%), lymphatic system in 17 (18%), the gastrointestinal and genitourinary system in 14 (15%), the nervous system in 9 (9%), the breast in 3 (3%) and multiple and other single sites in 16 (17 %). Bone marrow cytogenetics findings were documented in 74 (77%) patients; favorable, intermediate, and poor cytogenetic abnormalities account for 7 (9%), 45 (61%), and 22 (30%) cases respectively. After a median follow up of 135 weeks, 57 (59%) patients died. The median survival of primary and secondary acute myeloid leukemia with myeloid sarcoma was 52 and 11.5 months (P<0.0001); and that of favorable, intermediate and unfavorable cytogenetics abnormalities was 169, 52 and 17.5 months (P=0.04) respectively. Twenty six (27%) patients had no bone marrow involvement; and 18 (69%) of them were primary myeloid sarcoma (without antecedent malignancy or therapy). The median (range) age of those with and without bone marrow involvement was 53 (17-83) and 56 (17-81) years (P=0.6). At diagnosis patients with and without bone marrow involvement have a median (range) hemoglobin (gm/dL) (10.3 (6.2-15.4) vs 13.1 (9.9-15.2) P=0.0002), white blood cell count (X10 9 /L) (21.4 (1.1-182.5) vs 5.8 (2.4-23.2) P<0.0001), and platelet count (X10 9 /L) (71 (8-437) vs 250 (17-561) respectively. Aggressive chemotherapy therapy was given to 58 (83%) and 20 (77%) of patients with and without bone marrow involvement (P=0.6). The median survival was 17 and 20 months with and without bone marrow involvement (P=0.4). Of those with bone marrow involvement, 49 (70%) achieved complete remission, and 26 (53%) of those individuals subsequently relapsed. Conclusion: The treatment outcome of patients with myeloid sarcoma with or without bone marrow involvement seems the same. The conventional risk factors, antecedent hematological neoplasms and cytogenetic findings, have significant impact on survival.
