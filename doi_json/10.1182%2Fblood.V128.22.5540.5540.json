    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of disorders resulting in ineffective hematopoiesis primarily affecting older adults; median age of diagnosis is >70 years. Treatment decisions in MDS are largely based on a prognostic scoring system that has been incorporated into some drug labeling (NCCN 2016). The use of hypomethylating agents (HMAs) in patients with higher-risk (HR) MDS is supported by consensus guidelines, thus the purpose of this study was to examine factors influencing prescribing patterns in this subset of patients. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study using a large United States electronic medical record database. Newly diagnosed HR MDS patients initiating first-line therapy (1LT) between 1/2008 and 7/2015 were followed for 1 year prior to and \u2265 60 days after diagnosis. Included patients were \u226518 years old with evidence of HR MDS identified as follows: 1) \u22651 inpatient claim with an HR MDS diagnosis code (ICD-9 code: 238.73; ICD-10 codes: D46.20, D46.21, D46.22), or 2) \u22652 outpatient claims with an MDS diagnosis code, with the first one coded for HR MDS \u226560 days but 30 days after the initial chemotherapy agent(s) or a switch to another drug combination. Stem cell transplantation (SCT) was considered part of the LOT in which it occurred. All patients were followed until death or progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), loss to follow-up, or the end of study period (9/30/2015). Results: 345 patients newly diagnosed with HR MDS met the study criteria; 218 (63%) were treated with supportive care (including transfusions, hydroxyurea, colony-stimulating factors [CSFs], azole antifungals, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents [ESAs], or pain medications) or observation only and 127 (37%) were treated with MDS-directed therapy (HMAs, immunosuppressive therapy, induction-type therapy, SCT, or lenalidomide) \u00b1 supportive care (Table 1). Compared to untreated patients, a greater proportion of treated patients were male, had severe cytopenias (specifically, neutrophils 5%, hemoglobin <10 gm/dL, and platelets <50 K/L at baseline (Table 2). At end of follow-up, 27% (n=23) and 36% (n=30) of azacitidine-treated patients had progressed to AML or died whereas 28% (n=8) and 41% (n=12) of decitabine-treated patients progressed to AML or died, respectively. Conclusions: Despite the existence of treatment guidelines for HR MDS patients and given the limitations of a retrospective study, the majority of patients in a real-world setting are not treated with MDS-specific agents. Younger age (<75 years) and more severe cytopenias may be factors considered in the decision of whether or not to treat HR MDS. If treated, HMAs are the most utilized therapy in these patients, with azacitidine predominating. Cytopenias at baseline may also influence the choice between azacitidine and decitabine, although survival and progression to AML appear similar between groups.
