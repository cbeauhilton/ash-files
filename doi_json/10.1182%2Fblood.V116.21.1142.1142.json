    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1142 \u00df2GPI is a major antigen for autoantibodies associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, an autoimmune disease characterized by thrombosis and recurrent pregnancy loss. Only the dimeric form of \u00df2GPI generated by anti-\u00df2GPI antibodies is pathologically important, in contrast to monomeric \u00df2GPI which is abundant in plasma. Several cell-surface molecules including anionic phospholipids and ApoER2, a member of the lipoprotein receptor family, are implicated in the pathology of antiphospholipid syndrome. We created a dimeric inhibitor, A1-A1, to selectively target \u00df2GPI in \u00df2GPI/antibody complexes. This inhibitor consists of two ligand-binding A1 modules from ApoER2 connected by a flexible linker. A1-A1 disrupts the binding of \u00df2GPI/antibody complexes with anionic phospholipids and lipoprotein receptors. We compared the potency of A1-A1 to monomeric A1 for inhibition of the binding of \u00df2GPI/antibody complexes to anionic phospholipids. We tested the inhibition of \u00df2GPI present in human serum, \u00df2GPI purified from human plasma and domain V of \u00df2GPI. We demonstrated that when \u00df2GPI/antibody complexes are formed, A1-A1 is more effective than A1 in inhibition of the \u00df2GPI binding to cardiolipin, regardless of the source of \u00df2GPI. Half maximum inhibition of \u00df2GPI in human serum in the presence of anti-\u00df2GPI antibodies was achieved at 9 \u03bcM of A1-A1 and 218 \u03bcM of A1. Similarly, \u00df2GPI purified from plasma was inhibited to 50% by 26 \u03bcM of A1-A1 and 191 \u03bcM of A1. Also, A1-A1 strongly inhibited the binding of dimerized domain V of \u00df2GPI to cardiolipin compared to monomeric A1. Concentration of A1-A1 and A1 at half maximum inhibition of the binding of \u00df2GPI domain V to cardiolipin in the presence of dimerization antibodies was 29 \u03bcM and 204 \u03bcM, respectively. In the absence of anti-\u00df2GPI antibodies, A1-A1 and A1 were equally inefficient in the inhibition of the binding of monomeric \u00df2GPI to cardiolipin. The concentration of inhibitor at half-maximum inhibition of the binding of \u00df2GPI in human serum to cardiolipin was 189 \u03bcM for A1-A1 and 176 \u03bcM for A1. A novel inhibitor A1-A1 may be a starting point in the development of an effective therapeutic for antiphospholipid syndrome. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
