    "abstract_text": "Background: Microbial killing killing of by phagocytic cells by iron containing myeloperoxidase pathway is part of the immune system. We aimed to investigate the effects of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) on oxidative burst response of phagocytic cells and understand if the effect is reversible after iron supplementation. Material and methods: There were 57 IDA patients and 31 healthy children as the control group that were aged between 6 months-12 years with similar demographic status. IDA patients were classified according to the severity of their anemia as follows; group 1 (Hb10 gr/dl). Neutrophil and monocyte oxidative burst response of each three groups of IDA and control group were compared by flow cytometry. IDA group were given oral iron supplementation (3 mg/kg-Ferrosanol) therapy. On day 15 of iron supplementation therapy neutrophil and monocyte oxidative burst response of each three groups of IDA were rechecked and compared to the control group. In order to minimize the discrepancies observed in functional studies, the oxidative burst index was calculated as the proportion of oxidative burst response in IDA group to the simultaneous oxidative burst response in the control group. Results: The number of infection episodes observed in the last three months was significantly higher in the IDA group (0\u201313 episodes) than the control group (1\u20132 episodes) (p=0.05). Neutrophil (p=0.1) and monocyte (p=0.02) oxidative burst responses in IDA group were found to be less than the control group. On day 15 of iron supplementation therapy, these values were observed to increase to the control group\u2019s values. Evaluation of neutophil and monocyte burst indexes at the diagnosis of IDA revealed that the neutrophil burst indexes in the Hb \u226410 gr/dl group (p=0.006), and monocyte burst indexes in the Hb <8 gr/dl group (p=0.01) were significantly low. The initially observed significant differences in oxidative burst responses disappeared at day 15 of iron supplementation therapy in all hemoglobin groups. Conclusion: Correction of the differences in oxidative burst response after iron supplementation therapy implies the fact that IDA might be the reason for changes in neutophil and monocyte burst indexes.",
