    "abstract_text": "The efficacy of Pegfilgrastim (PF) in decreasing the duration of neutropenia has been proved after standard dose of chemotherapy. Results of PF after high dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous peripheral blood stem cells transplantation ASCT) are lacking. We studied the efficacy of PG in patients receiving HDC and ASCT for lymphoproliferative disease. Fifteen consecutive patients (8 males; 7 females) were onrolled in the study from September 2003 through March 2004. Median age of the patients was 56 years. Diseases were multiple myeloma in 5 patients, diffuse large cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) in 3 patients, follicular lymphoma in 4 patients, mantle cell lymphoma in one patient, and primary central nervous system lymphoma PCNSL) in 2 patients. All patients were eligible for HDC and ASCT per institutional criteria. Stem cells were collected with peripheral blood pheresis after high dose cyclophosphamide (7 cases); high dose Ara-c (5 cases); ifosfamide (1 case); CHOP-like chemotherapy (1 case); or in steady state (1 case). All the patients received daily G-CSF (5 to 10 mcg/kg). Three different conditioning regimens were used. Patients with multiple myeloma received high dose melphalan (200 mg/m\u00b2), patients with PCNSL received a combination of high dose Thiotepa (750 mg/m\u00b2), Busulfan (12 mg/kg), and Cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg), and patients with NHL received a BEAM chemotherapy. PF was administered as a single subcutaneous injection of 6 mg at day +3 after stem cell infusion, except for one patient whose injection was done on day 4. No adverse event attributable to PF was observed. There were no toxic death on study. All patients engrafted neutrophils and platelets. The median time to neutrophils engraftment (> 500/mm3) was 7 days (range, 4\u201312). Febrile neutropenia was almost constant (14/15) but never exceed OMS grade 2. Median number of days with IV antibiotics was 7 days (range 5\u201322). These preliminary data show that a fixed dose of 6 mg of PF given subcutaneously at day +3 after HDC and ASCT is safe and effective. A cost efficacy study is warranted to compare PF and daily dose of standard G-CSF after ASCT."
