    "abstract_text": "The CD40 antigen is involved in cell survival and differentiation of B-cells and is uniformly expressed on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. The CD40/CD40L interaction stimulates B-cells, dendritic cells and monocytes to proliferate, differentiate, up regulate co-stimulatory molecules and increase antigen presentation. While activation of CD40 can protect CLL cells against early fludarabine-induced apoptosis, these cells become sensitive to delayed death by extrinsic pathway apoptosis. ( Blood , 105 : 3193 \u20138, 2005 ). SGN-40 is a humanized anti-CD40 antibody entering clinical trials and has been reported to have weak agonistic properties following CD40 ligation. To pursue rational clinical development of SGN-40, we studied the effects of this antibody in fresh, non-cryopreserved primary CLL cells. These studies included classic antibody mediated killing mechanisms and evidence of both CLL cell activation and protection against early fludarabine-mediated apoptosis. CLL cells treated with SGN-40 (10 mcg/ml) for 2 hours (hrs) in the presence of human serum promoted no complement mediated cytoxicity (CDC) in 8 pts tested. Direct SGN-40 induced apoptosis of human CLL cells with or without anti-Fc IgG cross-linking at 24, 48 and 72 hrs was not increased over that observed with the isotype control antibody trastuzumab in 8 pts studied. In contrast, SGN-40 induced antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against CLL cells an average of 12% (\u00b111.39 SD, range 2\u201332%) killing at 4 hrs (effector to target cell ratio 25:1) in 6 pts tested. The SGN-40 induced ADCC against CLL cells were similar to that observed with alemtuzumab (average 19%, SD 6.9, range10\u201330%) or rituximab (average 18%, SD 12.48, range 8\u201342.5%). SGN-40 also mediated death in Raji and 697 lymphoblastic lymphoma cell lines via ADCC. Similar to reports by others with CD40 ligand, SGN-40 mediated activation was noted with modest up-regulation of CD80 and HLA-DR at 48hrs. When administered prior to fludarabine, SGN-40 also protected against death in 5 consecutive samples, although this was less than observed with CD40 ligand transfected HeLa cells, consistent with incomplete CD40 activation. Concurrent administration of SGN-40 and fludarabine did not protect from drug-mediated apoptosis. In conclusion, these findings suggest that SGN-40 has dual property of mediating cytotoxic effect by ADCC and partial CD40 activation. Development of SGN-40 as a therapeutic agent in CLL is justified and future studies by our group are focusing on enhancing SGN-40 mediated ADCC against CLL cells and potentially designing combination studies with SGN-40 to exploit this agent\u2019s ability to engage the CD40/CD40L network.",
