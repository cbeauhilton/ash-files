    "abstract_text": "Background: We have shown that administration of 90 Y-Zevalin to consolidate the therapeutic effects of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxatrone (FCM) \u00b1 rituximab (R) in the FCM \u00b1 R a\u0300 90 Y-Zevalin MCL trial from the Polish Lymphoma Research Group (PLRG) Multicenter Study resulted in PRs with FCM \u00b1 R becoming CRs after 90 Y-Zevalin. This finding could potentially benefit many MCL patients whose disease prognosis is poor. Our initial findings indicate that hematologic toxicity, as measured by duration of PMNs < 1000/ml and PLTs < 50,000/ml, is manageable, with recovery complete within 7\u201313 wks after 90 Y-Zevalin. Other researchers have reported that low dose rate radiation therapy is known to cause prolonged marrow damage to progenitors and stromal cells and reduce stem cell yields. Therefore, we specifically studied the hematologic toxicity of this consolidation regimen with 90 Y-Zevalin and the radiosensitizing drug fludarabine. Methods: We enrolled 10 histopathologically confirmed MCL patients (stage III-IV) who were ineligible for SCTs. Patients were treated with 3\u20136 cycles of FCM \u00b1 R. Patients were given 250 mg/m 2 of R followed 1 wk later with a second dose of R + 90 Y-Zevalin (11 or 15 MBq = 0.3 or 0.4 mCi/Kg based on PLT count; maximum dose = 32 mCi). Cytopenia was assessed with full blood counts every wk until recovery. Trephine biopsies were performed before 90 Y-Zevalin dosing and at 2 and 6 wks after 90 Y-Zevalin to assess marrow cellularity and stromal cells. At the same time points, mantle cell (CD19+CD20+CD5+CD23\u2212) infiltration of bone marrow (BM) was assessed by flow cytometry; myeloid clonogenic capacity (CFU-GM, BFU-E, CFU-GEMM, CFU-Meg) was evaluated by cell culture; and BM stroma function was measured by assaying 5 cytokines: GM-CSF, EPO, TPO, IL-3, and SCF. Results were compared with 7 historical follicular lymphoma (FL) patients who received 90 Y-Zevalin without fludarabine following relapse after chemoimmunotherapy (R-CHOP). Results: The level of neutro- and thrombocytopenia was greater in patients who received FCM \u00b1 R a\u0300 90 Y-Zevalin than in patients who received only 90 Y-Zevalin. A 2- to 4-fold greater degree of clonogenic capacity impairment was seen with FCM \u00b1 R 90 Y-Zevalin compared with only 90 Y-Zevalin, except for the CFU-Megs profiles, which were similar in both groups. A 7- to 10-fold \u2193 in myeloid stem and progenitor cells in response to FCM + R a\u0300 RIT was associated with a \u2193 in PMNs and PLTs. However, hematopoietic recovery was not prolonged in the fludarabine-pretreated group and did not correlate with the duration of CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM suppression. Stromal cells experienced minimal, transitory (fully reversible by 2 wks) impairment, suggesting a negligible adverse effect of 90 Y-Zevalin on BM stroma. Compared with pre- 90 Y-Zevalin values, GM-CSF levels \u2193 2-fold at wk 4, and TPO and IL-3 \u2193 30% and 3-fold, respectively, at wk 2. EPO levels \u2193 3-fold during the first 4 wks and paralleled decreases in BFU-Es. Conclusions: The consolidation of FCM \u00b1 R with 90 Y-Zevalin in MCL patients is a promising therapeutic approach. The FCM + R 90 Y-Zevalin treatment resulted in significant damage to myeloid stem and progenitor cells and increased neutro- and thrombocytopenia compared with 90 Y-Zevalin alone, but cytopenias are still manageable and hematopoietic recovery occurs within 9\u201312 wks after 90 Y-Zevalin. Clinicians must monitor the amount of BM infiltration and the BM hypocellularity after FCM + R before administering 90 Y-Zevalin.",
