    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2805 Background: Adequate expression and function of Jak2 in hematopoietic progenitors is critical for normal myelopoiesis. The JAK2 46/1 (GGCC) haplotype, a congenital particularity, predisposes to myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) both independently and through mutation of the JAK2 gene. The JAK2 V617F mutation and acquired homozygous status for JAK2 V617F are frequent in MPN. JAK2 V617F homozygosity is currently explained acquisition of the JAK2 V617F mutation followed by mitotic homologous recombination (HR) of JAK2 occurred between wild-type and mutant alleles, leading to uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 9p (9pUPD). Here we report the cases of 2 PV patients (Na1061 and Na1253) with acquired homozygous status for the JAK2 46/1 haplotype yet their granulocytes carried <20% JAK2 V617F. Aim: To determine whether HR of JAK2 can precede the V617F mutation in MPN. Methods: Granulocyte DNA and CD3+ lymphocyte DNA were examined in parallel with qPCR assays specific for the wild type and 46/1 haplotypes using rs12343867, a JAK2 intron 14 marker, as well as 4 other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) on chromosome 9p. 9pUPD clonality and length were determined using SNP array studies. Results: For both patients, lymphocytes were heterozygous for the 46/1 haplotype, confirming that granulocyte 46/1 homozygosity was acquired. Direct sequencing of the JAK2 and GNE genes and SNP array analyses revealed homologous recombination of part of the JAK2 gene (exons 6\u201319, patient Na1061) and of the complete 46/1 JAK2 haplotype (patient Na1253). Furthermore, for both patients, full length sequencing of JAK2 cDNA revealed no additional mutation. In both cases, HR of wild-type JAK2 was associated with growth advantage and high expression of recombined JAK2 . For both patients, further SNP array analyses revealed partial 9pUPD concerning <30% cells, which correlated with % JAK2 V617F and was consistent with 9pUPD having occurred after JAK2 V617F ( Figure 1 ).

Arrows indicate the chronology of events as deduced from the rs12343867 and V617F allelic ratios. Figure 1.

Arrows indicate the chronology of events as deduced from the rs12343867 and V617F allelic ratios.  Close modal The distortion of SNP allelic differences was higher at the telomeric end than in the centromeric region of chr. 9p. This indicated 2 distinct partial 9pUPDs for Na1061 and 1 partial 9pUPD for Na1253. Conclusion: Homologous recombination involving wild type JAK2 can precede JAK2 mutation and 9pUPD in MPN. Thus multiple paths and diverse alterations of the JAK2 gene can lead to MPN in individuals carrying the JAK2 GGCC haplotype. We propose a new model with JAK2 HR as early event, followed or not by JAK2 mutation, or/and JAK2 mutation(s) facilitating subsequent recombination resulting in 9pUPD and JAK2 V617F homozygosity.
