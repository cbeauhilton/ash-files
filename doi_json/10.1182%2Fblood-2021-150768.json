    "abstract_text": "Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is complicated by dysregulation of the blood coagulation system and high rates of thrombosis, but virus-intrinsic mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Increased intracellular calcium concentrations promote externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS), the membrane anionic phospholipid required for assembly and activation of the tenase and prothrombinase complexes to drive blood coagulation. TMEM16F is a ubiquitous phospholipid scramblase that mediates externalization of PS in a calcium-dependent manner. As SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a encodes a presumed cation channel with the ability to transport calcium, we hypothesized that ORF3a expression by infected host cells perturbs the cellular calcium rheostat, driving TMEM16F-dependent externalization of PS and enhancing procoagulant activity. Using a doxycycline-inducible system, synchronized expression of ORF3a in A549 pulmonary epithelial cells resulted in a time-dependent augmentation of tissue factor (TF) procoagulant activity exceeding 9-fold by 48 hours (p < 0.0001), with no change in TF cell-surface expression. This enhancement was dependent upon PS as determined by inhibition with the PS-binding protein lactadherin. Over 2-fold enhancement of prothrombinase activity (p < 0.0001) was also observed by 48 hours. ORF3a increased intracellular calcium levels by 18-fold at 48 hours (p < 0.0001), as determined by the intracellular calcium indicator fluo-4. After 16 hours of ORF3a expression, more than 60% of cells had externalized PS (p < 0.001) without increased cell death, as quantified by flow cytometry following annexin V binding. Immunofluorescence microscopy staining for ORF3a, annexin V, and nuclei confirmed ORF3a expression within internal and cell surface membranes and increased PS externalization. PS externalization was insensitive to the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK, and there was no evidence of apoptotic activation as determined by caspase-3 cleavage. By contrast, ORF3a expression did not augment coagulation in cells deficient in the calcium-dependent phospholipid scramblase TMEM16F. Similarly, ORF3a-enhanced TF procoagulant activity (p < 0.01) and prothrombinase activity (p<0.05) was completely abrogated using TMEM16 inhibitors, including the uricosuric agent benzbromarone that has been registered for human use in over 20 countries. Live SARS-CoV-2 infection of A549-ACE2 cells increased cell surface factor Xa generation at MOI 0.1 (p < 0.01) but not MOI 0.01 or following heat inactivation of the virus, and RNA sequencing confirmed ORF3a induction without increased F3 expression. RNA sequencing of human SARS-CoV-2 infected lung autopsy and control tissue (n= 53) confirmed these findings in vivo. Immunofluorescence staining for ORF3a and KRT8/18 and CD31 in SARS-CoV-2 infected human lung autopsy specimens demonstrated ORF3a expression in pulmonary epithelium and endothelial cells, highlighting the potential pathologic relevance of this mechanism. Here we demonstrate that expression of the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein ORF3a increases the intracellular calcium concentration and TMEM16F-dependent PS scrambling to augment procoagulant activity of the tenase and prothrombinase complexes. Our studies of human cells and tissues infected with SARS-CoV-2 support the pathologic relevance of this mechanism. We highlight the therapeutic potential to target the ORF3a-TMEM16F axis as with benzbromarone to mitigate dysregulation of coagulation and thrombosis during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.
