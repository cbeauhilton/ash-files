    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3070 Background: EZH2 and ASXL1 mutations were recently described in a spectrum of myeloid malignancies; mutational analysis of small patient cohorts has suggested the highest mutational frequency in myelofibrosis (MF) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The current study seeks to determine i) EZH2 and ASXL1 mutational frequencies in WHO-defined subcategories of MF, CMML and blast-phase myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), ii) if these mutations are mutually exclusive of TET2 , IDH , JAK2 and MPL mutations and iii) clinical correlates of ASXL1 and EZH2 mutations in primary MF (PMF) and CMML. Methods: The study population included 94 patients: 46 PMF, 22 post-polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia MF (post-PV/ET MF), 11 blast-phase MPN and 15 CMML (10 CMML-1 and 5 CMML-2). High throughput DNA resequencing was used to screen archived bone marrow for EZH2 , ASXL1 , TET2 , IDH , JAK2 and MPL mutations. Results: ASXL1 mutations were identified in all disease categories, including PMF (13%), post-PV/ET MF (23%), blast phase MPN (18%), and CMML (20%). We identified somatic mutations in TET2 in 15%, 14%, 18%, and 13% of PMF, post-PV/ET MF, blast phase MPN, and CMML, respectively. By contrast, mutations in EZH2 and IDH1/2 were less frequent. EZH2 mutations were seen in 3 out of 46 PMF patients (7%) and were not observed in patients with post-PV/ET MF or blast phase MPN. Mutations in IDH1/2 were restricted to blast-phase MPN (36%) and PMF (7%). No mutations in EZH2 or IDH1/2 were seen in CMML. Although we identified frequent TET2 and ASXL1 mutations, we only identified one patient with concurrent mutations in both genes. Three ASXL1 mutation-positive patients also had mutations in EZH2 or IDH and one patient had concurrent ASXL1 , TET2 and IDH mutations. In addition, 7 ASXL1 , 7 TET2 , and 1 IDH mutated patients were JAK2 V617F-positive. MPL mutations were also documented in all three mutation categories. All EZH2 - and ASXL1 -mutated PMF patients displayed normal karyotype and none underwent leukemic transformation during follow-up. Furthermore, mutated versus unmutated patients, in both instances, were not significantly different in age and sex distribution or clinical characteristics. The 3 EZH2 -mutated PMF patients died after 29, 48 and 67 months from the time of mutation analysis. In univariate analysis, the presence of mutant ASXL1 in PMF was associated with worse survival (p=0.06) but the borderline significance was lost during multivariable analysis that included risk stratification according to DIPSS ( Passamonti et al. Blood 2010; 115: 1703\u20131708 ). The 3 ASXL1 mutated CMML cases were alive after 40, 34 and 12 months from time of mutation analysis and none of them had progressed to acute leukemia; karyotype was normal in two of the patients and showed isolated trisomy 8 in one. Conclusions: ASXL1 mutations are as frequent as TET2 mutations in MF and CMML. In contrast, EZH2 mutations are infrequent and cluster with PMF. ASXL1 and EZH2 mutations are not mutually exclusive events, seem to be associated with normal karyotype and do not appear to be leukemogenic or prognostically detrimental in PMF or CMML.
