    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease in which malignant plasma cells engraft within the bone marrow (BM). It is postulated that components of the BM microenvironment provide pro-survival and pro-growth signals to MM cells thereby facilitating their survival and proliferation. Because the BM is known to be hypoxic, we hypothesized that low pO 2 activates an adaptive response mediated by hypoxia inducible transcriptional factors (HIFs) that protect MM cells from hypoxia-mediated apoptosis. We recently showed that targeting HIF activity with a polyamide compound (HIF-PA) that targets the hypoxic response element and blocks the ability of HIF to bind to its cognate DNA sequence both inhibits HIF-mediated gene expression and makes MM cells in culture MM xenografts engrafted in the BM of NOG mice sensitive to hypoxia-mediated killing in vitro and. In other tumors, hypoxia leads to acidification of the microenvironment that is a critical factor in their survival and spread. To examine if this is also the case for MM, we exposed a panel of cell lines to severe hypoxia (down to 0.2%) for 48 hrs. This produced a marked acidification of the microenvironment (decrease in pH from ~7.4 to ~6.4) as well as increase in the expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), a HIF-dependent enzyme important to pH regulation. Moreover, while MM cells are usually resistant to hypoxia-mediated apoptosis, exposure of 8226 MM cells to a specific CA9 inhibitor (acetazolamide) or Na + /H + transporter inhibitor (amiloride) increased hypoxia-mediated apoptosis by 3-4 fold. Tumor cells are able to sense changes in pO 2 levels through the activity of the Pryol-Hydroxylase (PHD1-3) sensing pathways. In particular, PHD3 is a known tumor suppressor gene that is frequently silenced in MM cells (including 8226), and confers resistance to hypoxia by constitutively activating HIF2a. We exogenously re-expressed PHD3 in MM cells and this concomitantly downregulated HIF2a expression in an oxygen-dependent manner and sensitized these cells to hypoxia-mediated apoptosis. Apoptosis was further increased with an acid pH. In addition, HIF-PA treatment of cells cultured under hypoxic and acidic pH (6.8) conditions showed a synergistic increase in apoptosis compared to control cells which was dependent on the PHD3 expression. Re-expression of PHD3 also resulted in an increased sensitivity to both acetazolamide and amiloride, suggesting that inhibiting HIF2a expression is critical for sensitizing MM cells to a low pH. Finally, exposure of MM cells to a low pO 2 and acidic pH (6.8) significantly enhanced MM migration as detected with the transwell migration assay; whereas the movement of the MM cells was almost totally inhibited (>80%) by treatment with low concentrations of acetazolamide. The results of these studies support our hypothesis that hypoxic conditions within the BM results in MM-mediated acidification of the tumor microenvironment that facilitates the survival and migration of malignant myeloma cells. Targeting the pathways that lead to acidification of the microenvironment might be a novel and effective primary or ancillary strategy for the treatment of MM.
