    "abstract_text": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCTs). Pre-HSCT conditioning typically consists of irradiation and drug administration resulting in the death of rapidly dividing cells. Damage to host tissues initiates a cytokine storm, promoting activation and expansion of donor anti-host alloreactive T cells. Cell death following conditioning has promoted the hypothesis that sensors of cytoplasmic DNA damage in GVHD target tissues contribute to cytokine production. We identified a role for Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), an innate immune sensor, in GVHD using pre-clinical MHC-matched (MUD) allo-HSCT models. Our studies show that the STING pathway rapidly regulates cytokine production in the intestinal tract and non-hematopoietic cells can contribute to these responses. Using mice expressing a human STING allele associated with decreased STING activity (Patel S, et al, J Immunol. 2016), we demonstrate its potential clinical importance. To assess STING involvement immediately post-HSCT, cytokine mRNA expression was examined 48 hrs after transplant of C3H.SW bone marrow (BM) + T cells into irradiated B6-WT or STING -/- recipients. Colonic tissue from STING -/- recipients had >2x reduction in IFN\u03b2, TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 mRNA vs. WT. On day 10 post-transplant, colons from STING -/- recipients exhibited reduced inflammation and overall pathology scores than WT. MHC-matched STING -/- HSCT recipients also experienced decreased weight loss, GVHD scores and skin pathology 6 weeks post-HSCT vs. WT. Chimeric studies demonstrated that the absence of STING in non-hematopoietic cells was responsible for the amelioration of GVHD. Therefore, to test STING signaling in non-hematopoietic intestinal cells, we generated intestinal organoid cultures. Intestinal organoids upregulated IFN\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and CXCL10 mRNA 6hrs after stimulation with the highly specific STING agonist DMXAA, supporting the notion that STING in intestinal tissues can contribute to inflammation in vivo . Interestingly, expression of these cytokines returned to baseline levels 24 hrs after stimulation ( Fig. 1A ). Next, we posited that if the absence of the STING pathway in recipients ameliorated GVHD after MHC-matched HSCT, pathway stimulation would exacerbate GVHD. B6-WT mice were injected with DMXAA immediately prior to HSCT with donor C3H.SW BM + T cells. Administration of a single dose of DMXAA increased expression of IFN\u03b2, TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 mRNA in colon tissue 48 hrs after transplant ( Fig. 1B ). Importantly, DMXAA treatment of WT - but not STING -/- - recipients significantly increased GVHD scores and lethality post-HSCT. To evaluate the potential impact of STING in the clinical setting, we evaluated recipients after transplant of C3H.SW BM + T cells into mice homozygous for a human allele associated with diminished STING activity (HAQ-MPYS knock-in mice, termed B6N-STING HAQ/HAQ here) and found that STING HAQ/HAQ mice contained a lower frequency of donor T cells expressing an activated phenotype (CD44 hi CD62L lo ) vs. WT recipients and the former also exhibited diminished GVHD ( Fig. 1C,D ). In contrast to STING knock-out recipients completely lacking protein, these results indicate that reduced STING activity can also affect GVHD. Interestingly, our findings that STING deficiency ameliorates GVHD in MHC-matched allo-HSCT contrast reported observations that STING activation can exacerbate GVHD after MHC-mismatched HSCT (Fischer J, et al, Sci. Transl. Med. 2017). We are currently investigating how the STING pathway regulates CD4 + and CD8 + T cell mediated GVHD and initial findings may provide insight into understanding the pathway's involvement in MHC-matched vs. mismatched allo-HSCT. In total, our studies demonstrate that STING plays an important role in regulating allo-HSCT and suggest this pathway can provide a target for new therapeutic strategies to ameliorate GVHD.
