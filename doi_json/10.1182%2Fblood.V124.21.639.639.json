    "abstract_text": "Background: IMiDs cytotoxicity in MM cells is mediated through their binding to CRBN within the cullin ring (CRL4) ligase. This binding triggers the ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of IKZF1/3. CRBN thalidmomide binding domain (TBD) was mapped to its C-terminus and the crystal structure of the CRBN-IMiDs bound complex identified several aa within exons 10 and 11 as essential for the IMiDs glutarimide ring binding to CRBN. Several groups including ours have reported that loss of CRBN is associated with resistance to IMiDs, however this does not appear to be the sole mechanism of resistance in primary MM cells. Furthermore, and while CRBN mutants (Y384A and W386A) are defective for IMiDs binding, acquisition of CRBN mutation is a rare event in MM patients suggesting alternative mechanisms of resistance. Thirteen splice variants of CRBN are reported (ensembl.org), however to date it is unclear whether these isoforms are expressed as proteins and their contribution to IMiDs resistance is yet to be defined. Methods and Results: In this study we investigated whether expression of full length CRBN (FL-CRBN) relative to its variants lacking the TBD and particularly the splice variant CRBN-005 (ENST00000424814) lacking exon 10, contribute to IMiDs resistance. RNA-seq analysis was performed on CD138 sorted cells in 15 paired patients samples obtained sequentially prior to lenalidomide treatment initiation and after development of resistance. Transcriptome sequence data was generated by RNA-seq with a minimum of 70x10 6 reads per sample. Filtered Fastq files were processed with the splice aligner TopHat against hg19. Of interest, splice isoforms of CRBN including isoforms lacking exon 10 and to a lesser extent exon 8 were identified in nearly all patients, albeit with at variable frequency. Splicing almost universally involved the full length of exon 10 including aa W382 and H378 that are now recognized to bind the 2 carbonyls residues on the IMiDs glutarimide ring and hence required for IMiDs binding to CRBN. Of note, mutation analysis of these 30 samples using the GATK RNAseq pipeline did not identify any mutations within CRBN exons 10 or 11. Furthermore, exome sequencing of CD138 cells from 10 additional lenalidomide resistant patients did not identify any CRBN SNVs or indels confirming the rarity of this event. In order to assess the contribution of FL-CRBN transcript and/or its splice variant (CRBN-005) to IMiDs sensitivity, we first confirmed by qRT-PCR (n=26, amplicons with 2 sets of primers overlapping exons 8-9 and exons 10-11) that low pre-treatment CRBN levels was significantly associated with shorter PFS (p=0.008) to lenalidomide. We next compared FL-CRBN (probe spanning exons 10-11) and CRBN-005 (Taqman probe spanning exons 9-11 junction) mRNA expression (qRT-PCR) in paired samples (n=21 patients - 42 pairs) collected immediately pre-treatment and at the time of progression post-lenalidomide. In 9/21 (42.8%), a significant reduction (2-\u0394\u0394CT < 0.75) in the FL-CRBN amplicon levels was observed between the paired pre- and post-treatment samples. The ratio of spliced CRBN-005 to full length CRBN (CRBN-005 / FL-CRBN) was significantly higher (1.3 to 54 fold) at the time of relapse in 11/21 (52.3%), including 5 patients where CRBN-FL transcript levels were unchanged. Lastly, to confirm whether CRBN-005 expresses a stable protein and to evaluate its role in IMiDs resistance, we cloned spliced CRBN-005 isoform (\u039410-CRBN) or full length CRBN (WT-CRBN) into pcDNA3 plasmid and transfected them in HEK293T cells. The \u039410-CRBN and WT-CRBN plasmids expressed a ~ 45 and 51 kDa proteins respectively that were detectable by western blotting with CRBN65 antibody (Celgene). Functionally, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with a lentiviral plasmid expressing Aiolos and the \u039410-CRBN or WT-CRBN plasmids. While treatment of WT-CRBN expressing cells with lenalidomide resulted in full loss of Aiolos, the expression of \u039410-CRBN significantly mitigated this effect. Conclusions: Study of the transcriptome of paired pre- and post-IMIDs in myeloma primary cells confirms the expression of CRBN-005 splice isoform lacking the IMiDs binding domain and reveals its enrichment in a subset of IMiDs resistance patients. Functionally we have demonstrated a novel mechanism of IMiDs resistance where the spliced isoform CRBN-005 acts as a dominant negative blocking IMiDs binding the CRL4 E3 ligase.
