    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) reside in a complex microenvironment (niche) within the bone marrow (BM), where multiple populations of microenvironmental stromal cells regulate and finely tune their proliferation, differentiation and trafficking. Recent studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are an essential component of the HSC niche. Intrinsic HSC CXCR4-SDF-1 signaling has been implicated in self-renewal and quiescence; however, the role of microenvironment CXCR4-SDF-1 signaling in supporting HSC function remains unclear. We previously demonstrated that microenvironmental stromal cell-derived CXCR4 is important for HSC recovery, as transplantation of wild-type HSC into CXCR4 deficient recipients showed reduced HSC engraftment. In this study, we now show that CXCR4-SDF-1 signaling in nestin + MSC regulates HSC maintenance under normal homeostatic conditions and promotes hematopoietic regeneration after irradiation. Multivariate flow cytometry analysis of marrow stroma cells revealed that mouse BM MSCs identified as CD45 - Ter119 - CD31 - Nestin + PDGFR + CD51 + express the CXCR4 receptor, which was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. To investigate the role of MSC CXCR4 signaling in niche maintenance and support of HSC function, we utilized genetic mouse models, in which CXCR4 could be deleted in specific stromal cell types. Selective deletion of CXCR4 from nestin + MSC in adult tamoxifen inducible nestin-cre CXCR4 flox/flox mice resulted in reduced total MSC in BM (Control vs. Deleted: 647\u00b1128 vs. 209\u00b151/femur, respectively, n=5, p<0.05), which was associated with a significant reduction in Lineage - Sca-1 + c-Kit + (LSK) cells (Control vs. Deleted: 18,033\u00b1439 vs. 4523\u00b1358/femur, respectively n=5, p2 fold. In contrast, deletion of CXCR4 from osteoblasts using osteocalcin cre CXCR4 flox/flox mice had no effect on HSC numbers in BM and blood.To investigate the role of nestin+ MSC CXCR4 signaling in BM niche reconstruction and hematopoietic recovery, we transplanted BM cells from wild-type mice into syngeneic wild-type or nestin+ MSC CXCR4 deleted recipients after lethal irradiation (950 rad) and analyzed HSC homing, niche recovery and hematopoietic reconstitution. Deletion of CXCR4 from nestin expressing MSC resulted in significantly reduced LSK cell homing at 16 hrs post transplantation (Control vs. Deleted: 8643\u00b11371 vs. 3004\u00b11044/ mouse, respectively, n=5, p<0.05). Robust apoptosis and senescence after total body irradiation was observed in nestin expressing MSCs lacking CXCR4 expression. At 15 days post-transplantation, chimeric mice with nestin+ MSC lacking CXCR4 expression displayed attenuated niche recovery and hematopoietic reconstitution compared to mice with wild-type stroma. In conclusion, our study suggests that CXCR4-SDF-1 signaling in nestin+ MSC is critical for the maintenance and retention of HSC in BM during homeostasis and promotes niche regeneration and hematopoietic recovery after transplantation. Furthermore, our data suggest the modulating CXCR4 signaling in the hematopoietic niche could be beneficial as a means to enhance HSC recovery following clinical hematopoietic transplantation or radiation/chemotherapy injury.
