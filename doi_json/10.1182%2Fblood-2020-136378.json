    "abstract_text": "Background: FXIa inhibition is a promising antithrombotic drug target. BMS-986177/JNJ-70033093 (BMS-177/JNJ-3093) is a novel small molecular inhibitor of FXIa currently in Phase II clinical trials with the potential for reduced bleeding risk as compared to the currently approved oral anticoagulantsHowever, reversal of anticoagulation may still be required in patients who have uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding or need an urgent surgical procedure. Aim: To evaluate the ability of nonspecific reversal agents (NSRAs) FEIBA \u00ae , NovoSeven \u00ae , Kcentra \u00ae , Profilnine \u00ae , BeneFix \u00ae , Novoeight \u00ae , and Cyklokapron \u00ae to neutralize the anticoagulation of BMS-177/JNJ-3093 in the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thromboelastography (TEG) and thrombin generation assay (TGA) in vitro using human plasma or whole blood. Method: aPTT and TEG were performed in human plasma and whole blood, respectively, using standard assay procedures. TGA was performed in human plasma using diluted kaolin aPTT reagent (1:10,000). JNJ-3093 was evaluated at different concentrations (0.3 -10 \u00b5M) to cover the anticipated exposures in the Phase II clinical trials. The NSRAs were evaluated at the anticipated concentrations according to the dosing information in their respective labels. Results: BMS-177/JNJ-3093 produced concentration dependent increases in aPTT (up to 4.4x at 10 \u03bcM); prolongations of lag time in TEG (2.6X); prolongations of lag time (3X) as well as reductions in peak thrombin generation (70%) in TGA. FEIBA \u00ae effectively neutralized the anticoagulant effects of JNJ-3093 in aPTT, TEG and TGA. NovoSeven \u00ae neutralized the BMS-177/JNJ-3093-induced prolongations in aPTT, prolongations in lag time in TEG and TGA assays and partially restored the peak thrombin generation in TGA. In contrast, all other NSRAs tested had negligible effects or did not show neutralization of anticoagulation induced by BMS-177/JNJ-3093 in the referenced assays Conclusion: These results demonstrate that FEIBA \u00ae and NovoSeven \u00ae can effectively neutralize the anticoagulant effects of BMS-177/JNJ-3093 in vitro. A clinical study is required to determine if these agents can reverse the anticoagulant effects of BMS-177/JNJ-3093 in patients.
