    "abstract_text": "Background: Antithrombotic medications are frequently used for the prevention of certain conditions such as venous thromboembolism (VTE). A major complication of treatment with antithrombotic is the risk of hemorrhage, especially after specific dental procedures. Objectives: This study was conducted to measure the knowledge of dentists and hygienists in Saudi Arabia about treating patients who are receiving new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and determining if dentists and hygienists are treating patients according to international guidelines. Methods: Study design: An English language questionnaire was piloted and then revised and distributed amongst various dental institutions within Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Study Subjects: 302 participants (Dentists 94.7% and dental hygienists 5.3%) working within Saudi Arabia, 58.3 were males, and 41.7% were females. 30.5% of the subjects' experience was between 5 and 10 years. Inclusion criteria: Dentists and hygienists who are practicing in Saudi Arabia during the defined study period and willing to participate. Results: It appears that there is still much confusion over-treating patients on antithrombotic medications, not only with the NOACs (i.e. Rivaroxaban, Dabigatran, Apixaban) but even with the more established medications, such as Warfarin and Aspirin; only approximately 30% of respondents were able to correctly respond to the appropriate method of treating patients receiving these medications. A large number of respondents stated that they did not know how to treat or would not treat patients on these antithrombotic medications (29.8% - 89.2%) which is very concerning, considering the large number of patients who are receiving antithrombotic medications. Conclusion: The familiarity of dentists and dental hygienists with the NOACs is very poor compared to the more established antithrombotic. Therefore, dental professionals need to be made more aware of the NOACs in order to facilitate proper and timely management.
