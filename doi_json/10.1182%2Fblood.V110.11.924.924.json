    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Aspirin usage before coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is associated with a lower risk of postoperative in-hospital mortality and appears to be safe ( 1 ). The aim of this study is to evaluate the biological effect of aspirin in these conditions. We evaluated thromboxane A 2 synthesis, indirect markers of platelet activation levels and inflammatory process in aspirin treated patients undergoing CABG surgery. Methods: Twenty aspirin treated (160 mg/day) patients were enrolled prospectively. We evaluated the association between aspirin usage for more than 1 month and urine 11-dehydro thromboxane B 2 (11DHTB 2 ) level, as well as soluble P-Selectin (sPsel) and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) serum levels during the 7 days following surgery. Considering the variation of platelet count following CABG surgery and the known relation between sCD40L level and platelet mass ( 2 ), we reported sPsel and sCD40L serum levels to the platelet count. Blood and urine samples were collected at H0 (before surgery) and at H36, 72, 168 post surgery. Inflammatory process was also investigated by C-reactive protein and fibrinogen level determinations. Results: Main data are expressed in table 1. 11DHTB 2 (metabolite of thromboxane A 2 ) increased at H36 following surgery and decreased progressively until day 7 without reaching the preoperative level. 11DHTB 2 didn\u2019t correlate with the inflammatory process (C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels). Only concomitant increase of leukocytes count and 11DHTB 2 level was observed. In the other hand, at H36 post surgery, sPsel and sCD40L levels slightly increased. Soluble P-selectin level progressively decreased until H168 while sCD40L level remain stable up to H168. At least, no correlation was found between sPsel, sCD40L and 11DHTB 2 . Conclusion: These data indicated that, under aspirin treatment, a slight and transitional platelet activation occurred after CABG surgery. According to the lake of correlation between sPsel, sCD40L levels and 11DHTB 2 level, we hypothesized that 11DHTB 2 is produced by an another source (i.e leukocytes) which occurred independently to platelet activation.
