    "abstract_text": "Over 15 distinct chromosomal translocations have been documented in human leukemias that involve rearrangement of the nucleoporin gene, NUP98. While most NUP98 fusion partners are HOX transcription factors, the remaining 7 have no obvious common unifying function or unique role in hematopoiesis. The translocation t(11;20) identified the novel NUP98 fusion partner Topoisomerase I (TOP1), a catalytic enzyme known for its role in relaxing supercoiled DNA. We recently demonstrated that over-expression of NUP98-TOP1 induces a lethal, transplantable AML in a murine bone marrow (BM) transplantation model (Gurevich et al , Blood 2004). To further explore the mechanistic process of leukemic transformation we sought to establish BM cell lines that retain the preleukemic-inducing properties of NUP98-TOP1. Murine BM was transduced with GFP-linked NUP98-TOP1 retrovirus. Following 4 weeks of culture, there was a striking out-growth of GFP + cells (expansion of 1% to >80% GFP + cells) and generation of poly-clonal cell lines (herein called NT 12.1 and NT 12.2) exhibiting features of primitive cells (blast-like morphology, lin \u2212/lo , increased levels of c-Kit, Sca-1 and CD34). NT cell lines had limited differentiation ability when plated in GM-CSF, G-CSF or M-CSF but in methylcellulose colony assays generated large granulo-monocytic colonies at high frequency (1 in 12) when plated in IL-3, IL-6, SCF and EPO. Strikingly, NT cell lines demonstrated significant levels of short-term in vivo repopulating ability when transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients. Transplant doses of 10 4 -10 6 cells yielded >50% engraftment at 1 month post transplant (tx) (54\u00b113% GFP + WBC; n=12) which diminished to levels of <20% by 2 months. The frequency of cells with repopulating potential was estimated at 1 in 1609 following limit dilution assay which yielded repopulation of 3 of 4 recipients 1 month post-tx (range; 5\u201346%). While the level of engraftment diminished in NT 12.1 mice, two NT 12.2 mice developed fatal MPD/AML after a latency of 103 and 166 days. Thus these NUP98-TOP1 cell lines demonstrate a differentiation block in vitro, high level short term repopulating capacity and the potential to give rise to AML with a long latency that is consistent with a preleukemic phenotype. These lines now provide a novel platform to test candidate genes for their ability to co-operate with NUP98-TOP1 to induce leukemia. As an initial candidate, we tested the collaborating potential of Meis1, a HOX co-factor known to co-operate with several NUP98-HOX fusions to induce a rapid leukemia and may thus represent a common collaborating gene in NUP98 associated leukemias. When a representative cell line (NT12.2) was infected with a YFP-linked Meis1 retrovirus and transplanted into mice, the mice contained only GFP + /YFP + circulating WBC by 1 months post-tx. However, despite co-expression of both genes in all transplanted mice, there was no apparent acceleration of induction of AML with 5 of 6 recipients succumbing to leukemia by 9 months post-tx, (median survival 164 days; range 101\u2013193). This long latency argues that Meis1 does not collaborate with NUP98-TOP1 to induce leukemia and that NUP98-TOP1 has distinct mechanisms of leukemogenesis compared to NUP98-HOX fusions. These novel pre-leukemic, transplantable cell lines generated by NUP98-TOP1 will facilitate further large scale screens for potential cooperative genes and delineation of the mechanistic basis of NUP98-TOP1 induced transformation.",
