Hematological and extra-hematological adverse events associated to Hydroxyurea (HU) treatment in patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are object of particular interest in the Ph-negative MPN since they can significantly limit the HU use. Objective. To evaluate the extra-hematological adverse events associated to HU treayment in a large cohort of Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) patients. Material and Methods. One thousand and seventy-five out of the 2005 ET patients registered in the RIT were treated with HU and are the object of this report. The patients, 641 females (59.6%) and 434 males (40.4%), diagnosed according to the PVSG or WHO criteria in 54 hematological centers of the RIT, started treatment with HU as first (92%) or second (8%) line, at median age of 65 years.The mean duration of HU treatment was 3.3 years. The HU treatment was withdrawn in 221 (20.5%) patients after a mean of 3.0 years.The administered dose of HU was 0.25\u20133.0 g/day (median 1), and a mean cumulative dose was 1113 g. The extra-hematological adverse events (EHAEs) observed during the HU treatment were distinguished in HU related AEs (HU-EHAEs), ET related AEs (ET-EHAEs) and HU or ET unrelated AEs (U-EHAEs).Results. During the HU treatment (3587 pt-y) 378 EHAEs were reported in 207 (19.3%) patients, being the HU-EHAEs 244 (6.8/100 pt-y) in 170 (15.8%) patients. In detail, the HU-EHAEs were: dermatological in 108 (48.3%) cases (38 hyperpigmentation, 26 leg ulcers, 22 maculo-papular rash, 10 lichenoid eruptions, 5 skin cancer, 4 alopecia); gastro-intestinal in 80 (32.8%) cases (37 nausea/vomiting, 30 diarrhea, 13 gastro-intestinal intolerance); systemic in 35 (14.3%) cases (28 fever, 7 fatigue); neurological in 19 (7.8%) cases (headache); miscellanea in 2 (0.8%) cases. Conclusion. This preliminary analysis in 1075 ET patients of the Registro Italiano Trombocitemia (RIT) treated with HU shows that the extra-hematological adverse events referred to the HU (HU-EHAEs) occurred with not negligible rate (6.8/100 pt-y) and need to be object of attention in the management of ET patients.
