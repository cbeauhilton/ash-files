    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1980 Myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPNs) are heterogeneous hematologic disorders represented by three main phenotypes: polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The major molecular lesion in these diseases is JAK2V617F, which occurs in over 95% patients with PV and in over 50% of patients with ET or PMF. The pathogenic effects of JAK2V617F have been demonstrated by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, transgenic, and knock-in mouse models, but the precise mode of JAK2V617F action is not clear. Interestingly, in the knock-in model, expression of JAK2V617F causes severe PV-like disease but not ET-like phenotype as seen in patients. To verify the pathogenic role of JAK2V617F, we further characterized the phenotypes of three lines of JAK2V617F transgenic mice generated by using the vav gene promoter which drives expression of transgenes in the hematopoietic system. These mice developed MPN-like phenotypes in a transgene dose- and age-dependent manner. Line A mice have a JAK2V617F gene copy number of 13; they develop MPN phenotype with marked increases in blood counts and enlarged spleens as early as 4\u20136 weeks after birth. In contrast, lines B and D mice have a transgene copy number of 2 and 1, respectively, and it takes nearly 70 weeks for these mice to show MPN-like phenotypes. The phenotype of line A mice is particularly noteworthy. Essentially all the hemizygous line A mice displayed an ET-like phenotype with marked elevations in platelet counts (usually over 4000\u00d710 9 /L by the age of 15 weeks), but only a slight increase in red cell and white cell counts. In contrast, all the homozygous mice exhibited a clear PV-like phenotype with elevations in all three types of blood cells, although their platelets hardly ever went over 4000\u00d710 9 /L. The hemizygous mice developed myelofibrosis after 30 weeks while the homozygous mice showed the symptom within only 10 weeks. As expected, the increased blood cell counts and formation of myelofibrosis are associated with mobilization of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to peripheral hematopoietic tissues (blood, spleen, and liver). By conducting stem cell transplant experiments, we further proved that JAK2V617F-induced ET and PV-like phenotypes are transplantable. Our study demonstrates that transgenic expression of JAK2V617F is capable of producing all three phenotypes of MPNs in a transgense dose- and age-dependent manner. Our transgenic mice thus represent an excellent model system to study MPNs. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
