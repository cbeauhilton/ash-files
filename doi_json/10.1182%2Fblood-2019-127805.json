    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Hematologic malignancies, including B cell lymphomas such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL), have increased demands for cholesterol and cholesteryl esters to maintain membrane anchored pro-proliferative and pro-survival signaling pathways, including B cell receptor signaling. Recent evidence suggests that certain cancer cell lines, including several anaplastic large T cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell lines, are auxotrophic for cholesterol and are sensitive to cholesterol reduction-induced ferroptosis (Garcia-Bermudez, Nature 2019), an iron dependent form of programmed cell death characterized by accumulation of lipid peroxides. We have developed a cholesterol depleting functional lipoprotein-like nanoparticle (Flip-NP) that specifically targets the high-affinity HDL receptor, scavenger receptor type B1 (SCARB1), which maintains cellular and cell membrane cholesterol homeostasis. Our prior data demonstrated that Flip-NPs induce B cell lymphoma cell death in vitro and in in vivo xenograft models. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the mechanism of cell death by Flip-NPs in B cell lymphomas is ferroptosis, and that Flip-NPs would be potent therapy for an expanded number of cholesterol-addicted malignancies, including ALCL. Methods: After informed consent, primary B cell lymphoma cells were isolated from excisional biopsies from patients with FL or DLBCL. The SUDHL4 [germinal center (GC) DLBCL], Ramos [Burkitt's lymphoma], SUDHL1 [ALCL] and SR-786 [ALCL] cell lines were used for in vitro experiments. SCARB1 expression was quantified using flow cytometry and western blot analysis. Cell viability was quantified using the MTS assay and flow cytometry. Ferroptosis was measured using the lipophilic antioxidant ferrostatin-1 or the iron chelator deferoxamine. Gene expression changes were quantified using RT-qPCR. Lipid peroxidation was measured using C11-BODIPY and flow cytometry. SUDHL1 and SUDHL4 flank tumor xenografts were initiated in SCID-beige mice, with Flip-NPs administered 3 times per week IV. Results: Primary B cell lymphoma cells were isolated from patients with FL (n=4) or DLBCL (n=2), and all samples expressed some level of SCARB1 by flow cytometry. Flip-NPs increased cell death in 3 of the 4 FL samples and 1 of 2 DLBCL samples. In Ramos and SUDHL4 cells, RT-qPCR data showed that Flip-NP-mediated cholesterol reduction led to up-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes and down-regulation of glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), a critical protein responsible for degradation of lipid peroxides. Correspondingly, as shown with C11-BODIPY, Flip-NP treatment increased lipid peroxide accumulation in Ramos and SUDHL4 cells. Addition of ferrostatin-1 or deferoxamine reduced Flip-NP induced cell death, demonstrating that the mechanism-of-action of Flip-NPs involves, at least in part, ferroptosis. Given the sensitivity of cholesterol auxotrophic cell lines to cholesterol reduction-induced ferroptosis, we tested the efficacy of the Flip-NPs against cholesterol auxotrophic ALK+ ALCL cell lines SUDHL1 and SR-786. SCARB1 was expressed in both cell lines. Flip-NPs potently induced cell death in both SUDHL1 and SR-786 cells in vitro . In vivo , systemic administration of Flip-NPs reduced tumor volumes in both SUDHL4 and SUDHL1 tumor xenograft models. Conclusions: Our data show that Flip-NPs reduce GPX4 expression and increase lipid peroxide accumulation in B cell lymphoma cell lines, resulting in ferroptosis. Expanding on these results, Flip-NP efficacy was also demonstrated in cholesterol auxotrophic ALK+ ALCL cell lines and primary patient-derived B cell lymphoma cells. These in vitro results translated to in vivo murine models, as systemic administration of Flip-NPs potently reduced DLBCL and ALK+ ALCL tumor xenograft burden. Flip-NPs are a molecularly targeted, first-in-class therapy that may be effective for malignancies reliant upon cellular cholesterol.
