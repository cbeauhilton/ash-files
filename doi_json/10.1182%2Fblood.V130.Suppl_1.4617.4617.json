    "abstract_text": "Substantial advances in genome engineering offer new therapies for hemoglobin (Hb) disorders including sickle cell disease. Fetal hemoglobin reactivation remains a viable strategy, as recently demonstrated in human erythroid cells with an artificial looping molecule ZF-Ldb1, tethering Ldb1 to the \u03b3-globin promoter by specific zinc finger proteins (Deng et al., 2014). Large animal preclinical testing can improve the therapeutic potential of such approaches by optimizing safety and efficacy issues before launching clinical trials in humans. A robust in vitro erythroid evaluation system, however, does not exist to determine if fetal hemoglobin reactivation can be modeled in the rhesus macaque. Therefore, in the current work, we aimed to develop an efficient in vitro erythroid differentiation model from rhesus hematopoietic progenitor cells with Hb production at detectable protein levels, and to evaluate rhesus fetal hemoglobin reactivation with ZF-Ldb1. To adapt a human erythroid differentiation method to rhesus cells, we used C3H or OP9 feeder cells to culture rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with HEMA differentiation media containing 10ng/ml stem cell factor (SCF), 1ng/ml interleukin-3 (IL3), 2U/ml erythropoietin (Epo), and 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Migliaccio et al., 2010). Two weeks after erythroid differentiation, robust Hb production evaluated by HB electrophoresis was obtained on both C3H and OP9 feeder cells but not in feeder-free conditions. Increased concentration of SCF (20x), IL3 (10x), and Epo (1.5x) allowed for Hb production even in feeder-free conditions; however, fetal Hb was predominant (due to 20x SCF). Both conditions provided similar levels of enucleation (39\u00b16.3% vs 29\u00b15.6%, ns), indicating efficient differentiation. We then compared HEMA media with serum-free StemSpan-based differentiation media to evaluate transduction with a GFP-encoding lentiviral vector at MOI 2.5 two days after initiating differentiation. Transduction was almost completely inhibited (0.4\u00b10.5%) in HEMA media, while StemSpan-based transduction media followed by HEMA differentiation media resulted in significant increase of transduction efficiency (41\u00b18.5%, p<0.01). These data demonstrate that feeder cells are required for rhesus erythroid differentiation in HEMA media, while FBS strongly interferes lentiviral transduction. Next, we sought to establish a reverse phase HPLC method to quantitatively analyze rhesus globins among differentiated erythroid cells. Peaks on the HPLC chromatogram were eluted and run in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for protein identification. We identified \u03b2-globin and \u03b3-globin (HBG1 and HBG2) peaks using both rhesus peripheral blood (99\u00b126% and 0.65\u00b10.28%) and in vitro differentiated rhesus erythroid cells (63\u00b113% and 37\u00b116%), which is essential for Hb switching analysis. In addition, human \u03b2-globin and T87Q \u03b2-globin (with anti-sickling mutation) proteins were also separated from rhesus globins in the HPLC chromatogram and were detectable for quantitation. Finally, we evaluated whether fetal Hb expression can be induced by the ZF-Ldb1 molecule in rhesus erythroid cells. We transduced differentiating rhesus CD34 + cells with ZF-Ldb1-encoding lentiviral vectors that are driven by an erythroid specific ankyrin-1 promoter, and contain GFP along with a \u03b2-globin locus control region (LCR) enhancer or YFP without the LCR. After erythroid differentiation, we obtained both LCR/ZF-Ldb1/GFP + (9.4%) and ZF-Ldb1/YFP + (1.3%) rhesus erythroid cells, and higher \u03b3-globin RNA expression was detected for GFP + and YFP + fractions (68.1\u00b11.5% and 59.8\u00b12.1%, respectively), as compared to GFP - and YFP - controls (28.1\u00b13.1% and 31.8\u00b11.9%, p<0.05). These data demonstrate successful \u03b3-globin induction with ZF-Ldb1 vectors in the rhesus macaque. In conclusion, we developed an efficient rhesus erythroid cell differentiation protocol from hematopoietic progenitor cells with robust Hb production detectable at protein levels, analyzed in a newly established HPLC method. The ZF-Ldb1 vector transduction allows for induction of \u03b3-globin expression in rhesus erythroid cells. Further studies are warranted to optimize gene modification and transplantation of rhesus hematopoietic progenitor cells. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
