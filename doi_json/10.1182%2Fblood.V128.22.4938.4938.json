    "abstract_text": "This study investigated the safety and efficacy of IV-Globulin SN, a 10% intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), in patients with severe ITP (platelet count \u00a1\u00c220 x 10 9 /L). Among 81 eligible patients, 31 patients were newly diagnosed, 7 patients had persistent ITP, and 43 patients had chronic ITP. Five patients had received splenectomy. Patients received IV-Globulin SN 1 g/kg/day on two consecutive days; infusion rate was initially 1 mg/kg/minute and then doubled every 30 minutes to a maximum of 8 mg/kg/minute. Fifty-eight patients (72%) attained the primary efficacy endpoint of clinical response (platelet count \u00a1\u00c3 50 x 10 9 /L within 7 days). Their median time to response was 2 days and the median duration of response was 10 days (range from 1 to 28 days). Complete response (platelet count \u00a1\u00c3 100 x 10 9 /L over 7 days) was obtained in 14 patients (17%). Response rates were not significantly different when compared the patients with newly diagnosed, persistent or chronic ITP; previous treatment with immunosuppressant or not; splenectomized or not. IV-Globulin SN 10% was well tolerated and the frequency of mucocutaneous bleeding was decreased during the study period ( figure 1 ). There was no unexpected adverse event. The mean half-life and Cmax of study drug were 28.9 days and 34.6 g/L in 25 tested patients. There were no unexpected adverse events. In conclusion, IV-Globulin SN was efficacious in adult ITP patients regardless of their disease status as well as safe given that the resolution of bleeding and minimal infusion-related adverse events.
