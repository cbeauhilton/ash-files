    "abstract_text": "Epigenetic program is a molecular basis of cellular identity and functions. We have shown the transcriptome ( Cancer Cell , 2012) and the underlying histone methylation patterns ( Blood , 2016) of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL). The epigenetic landscape of ATL is defined as \"genome-wide H3K27me3 accumulation\". Similar accumulation has been detected in multiple cancers, particularly in hematological malignancies. Relief of the cumulative methylation may restore the aberrant transcriptome to ideal expression signature, leading to a promising treatment. Due to variation characteristics, EZH2 is recognized as a druggable target. However, extrinsic regulation of methylation pattern is still challenging without knowledge of molecule(s) and their combination that needs to be targeted to reprogram the epigenome in anticipation of synthetic lethality. To redefine the conventional concept, we first examined expression and global occupancy patterns of H3K27 methyltransferases EZH1 and EZH2. EZH2 expression was low in CD4+ T cells and significantly high in ATL. In contrast, basal EZH1 was very high in mature lymphocytes compared with undifferentiated lineages and also high in ATL. ChIP-on-chip analysis revealed significant changes in distributions of both EZH1 and EZH2 in primary ATL cells, which caused abnormal H3K27me3 accumulation. Importantly, over 80% of H3K27me3 are specifically induced by either EZH1 (28.9%) or EZH2 (14.4%), or by both (39.3%). Moreover, they have differential functions by regulating specific targets; EZH2 suppresses various transcription regulators, establishing complex gene regulatory network. EZH1 would rather directly induce H3K27me3 at genes involving functional processes such as lymphocyte activation. We detected EZH1 and EZH2 in functional polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in ATL and DLBCL cells. Unexpectedly, EZH1/2 were co-localized with H3K4me3 at a small population of the lymphoma genome. The \"EZH1/2 + H3K4me3\" non-canonical targets such as cell cycle activators were highly expressed in ATL. We next compared functions of EZH1/2. Single depletion of EZH1 or EZH2 suppressed T- and B-lymphoma cell proliferation, which supports their unique functions. The broad reduction of H3K27me3 was achieved by EZH2 inhibition; however, genome-wide ChIP demonstrated that EZH2 inhibition or depletion triggered strong compensatory action of EZH1, followed by rebound accumulation of H3K27me3 at many functional genes in EZH1+ lymphoma cells. We found that a transcription factor YY1 affects PRC2 recruitment and EZH1 compensation after EZH2 inhibition. Double depletion of EZH1+EZH2 or YY1+EZH2 surmounted the epigenetic homeostasis. In addition, depletion of EZH1 significantly enhanced effects of EZH2 inhibitors in ATL and DLBCL cells (5.47~205-fold). These data indicate requirements for the aberrant epigenome, namely, fluctuating EZH2 (upregulation or mutation) and underlying stable EZH1. We have succeeded in developing an unprecedented EZH1/2 dual-inhibitor (IC50 9.0 nM (EZH1); 10 nM (EZH2)). The new drug successfully inhibited genome-wide EZH1/2 occupancies without compensation, resulting in effective H3K27me3 reduction and gene reactivation compared with the single inhibitor. Of note, the dual-inhibitor suppressed expression of the non-canonical EZH1/2 + H3K4me3 target genes. Besides H3K27me3 reprogramming, EZH1/2 inhibition could modulate genes through H3K4me3 regulation and indirect influence on the secondary regulatory network and signaling pathways such as NF-kB. The EZH1/2 dual-inhibitor significantly blocked primary ATL cell survival and in vivo tumor growth of ATL and DLBCL models. Furthermore, we evaluated drug efficacy in various models of hematological malignancies including ATL, DLBCL ( EZH2 WT and mutant), Burkitt lymphoma, and PTCL, which are all originated from EZH1+ differentiated lymphocytes. All of them showed higher sensitivity against the EZH1/2 inhibitor compared with the EZH2 solo inhibitor (5.2~200-fold). We did not detect strong adverse effects in normal T cells. These integrated molecular and phenotypic analyses provide a novel concept \"EZH1+EZH2 dual-targeting\" and demonstrate validity of the new drug in the treatment of malignant lymphomas. Taking these results, a Phase I clinical trial against T- and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas including ATL is now under way in Japan. Disclosures Yamagishi: Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.: Research Funding.
