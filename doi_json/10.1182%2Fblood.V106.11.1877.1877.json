    "abstract_text": "Inhibition of either coagulation factor Xa (FXa) or thrombin (FIIa) alters ex vivo biomarkers of coagulation and decreases thrombus size in animal models of experimental thrombosis. The objective of this study was to determine if combining FXa and FIIa inhibitors would synergistically reduce the magnitude of IIa generated without elevating markers of bleeding. A synergistic combination may translate into lower doses, more effective anticoagulation and better safety. To predict the FXa and FIIa inhibitor combinations with the maximum potential for synergy, PD 0313052, a potent, selective FXa inhibitor, and argatroban, a potent FIIa inhibitor, were each tested independently and in combination using an in vitro thrombin generation assay. Individually, PD 0313052 and argatroban reduced total thrombin generation (TG) in a concentration dependent manner with IC 50 \u2019s of 497\u00b1148 and 882\u00b1193 nM, respectively. Subsequently, PD 0313052 and argatroban were combined in 96 well plates at concentrations ranging from 0.125x to 8x their respective IC 50 concentrations. Analysis using the Bliss Independence Model identified statistically significant synergistic activity, with the greatest increase (33%) over simple additivity at 249 and 441 nM FXa to FIIa, respectively, both below their respective IC 50 concentrations. Furthermore, combinations of PD 0313052 and argatroban were evaluated in an assay measuring activated clotting time (ACT). Although both PD 0313052 and argatroban dose-dependently elongated the ACT, the combination of 0.5x the TG IC 50 concentrations, which demonstrated the greatest synergy in the TG assay, showed the smallest increase in the ACT, prolonging clotting time by only 15%. These data demonstrate that the combination of a specific factor Xa inhibitor and a specific IIa inhibitor can synergistically reduce thrombin generation without appreciable elevation of ACT, suggesting that dual inhibition of FXa and FIIa, using relatively low doses of each, may provide efficacious and safe treatment for thromboembolic diseases.",
