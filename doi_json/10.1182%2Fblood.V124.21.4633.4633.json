    "abstract_text": "Background : Most patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) are elderly and age >65 years is an adverse prognostic factor ( JCO 2013;31:2428 ). Our objective in the current study was to examine risk factors for survival and treatment outcome in younger patients (age \u226465 years), with emphasis on molecular and cytogenetic markers. Methods : DNA analysis for SRSF2, SF3B1, U2AF1 , ASXL1 and SETBP1 mutations was carried out on specimens obtained at time of diagnosis. We used both conventional and revised ( see accompanying ASH 2014 abstract ) cytogenetic risk models to query their application in the current study population. Treatment data included outcome of allogeneic stem cell transplant (HCT) and treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMA), including azacitidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC). Results: Survival: 259 patients (median age 59 years, range 18-65; 75% males) with WHO-defined CMML and age\u2264 65 years were included in the study: 108 from the French consortium, 81 Mayo Clinic, 47 Moffitt Cancer Center and 23 University of Milan; 217 (84%) patients had CMML-1 and the remainder CMML-2. At a median follow-up of 26 months, 124 (48%) deaths and 79 (31 %) leukemic transformations were documented. Mutational frequencies were 34% (61 / 178) for ASXL1 , 45% (74/165) for SRSF2 , and 4% (7/168) for SETBP1 . Cytogenetic data was available in 248 of 259 study patients; 56 (23%) patients displayed abnormal karyotype and the revised cytogenetic risk designations included 196 (80%) low, 29 (12%) intermediate, and 23 (9%) high. In univariate analysis, lower hemoglobin (p<0.0001), higher WBC (p=0.005), higher monocyte count (AMC) (P=0.004), lower platelet count (p=0.004), presence of circulating immature myeloid cells (IMC) (p=0.004), presence of circulating blasts (p<0.0001), bone marrow (BM) blasts \u226510% (p=0.005), WHO morphological subtype (p=0.0003), Spanish cytogenetic risk stratification (p=0.0002), revised Mayo cytogenetic risk stratification (p<0.0001), SRSF2 (p=0.03) and ASXL1 (p=0.03) mutational status predicted shortened survival. In multivariable analysis, lower hemoglobin (p<0.0002), presence of circulating blasts (p<0.0001), SRSF2 (p=0.03) and ASXL1 mutational status (p=0.04) retained their negative prognostic impact. A similar analysis identified circulating IMC (p<0.0001), presence of circulating blasts (p<0.0001), and BM blast % (p=0.0002) as predictors of blast transformation (BT). Response to hypomethylating agents: Seventy-two (28%) patients received HMA (AZA-46, DAC-26, both-6). In the AZA group, median number of cycles was 5 (range; 1-44), median duration of therapy 5 months (range;1-59) with 4 (6%) receiving DAC on progression and 26 (42%) proceeding with HCT. Over-all response rate (ORR) was 25% (6/24) and included complete response (CR) in 2 (8%) patients, partial response (PR) in 2 (8%) and hematological improvement in 2 (8%). In the DAC group, median number of cycles was 6 (2-25), median duration of therapy 5 months (range;1-49), with 2 (8%) receiving AZA on progression; ORR was 50% (7/14) and included CR in 4 (29%) patients, PR in 1 (7%) and HI in 2 (14%). ASXL1 (p=0.4), SRSF2 (p=0.7) mutational status or karyotype (p=0.5 for Spanish and 0.3 for revised Mayo) did not correlate with response to HMA. Allogeneic stem cell transplant: 50 patients underwent HCT. Conditioning regimen was reported in 41 patients and included myeloablative (MA) in 14 (34%) (median age 51 years, 27-62) and reduced intensity (RIC) in 27 (66%) (median age 48 years, 18-65). Donor source was documented in 40 patients and included matched related in 19 (48%), matched unrelated in 12 (30%), mismatched unrelated in 4, haploidentical in 2 and umbilical cord transplant in one. 27 (63%) patients had chronic GVHD (50% in MA group and 80% in the RIC group). Among 40 evaluable patients, 23 (57%) achieved CR, 8 (21%) relapsed and 8 (21%) died from transplant-related complications. ASXL1 (p=0.9), SRSF2 (p=0.5) mutational status or karyotype (p=0.2 for Spanish and 0.3 for revised Mayo) did not affect transplant outcome. Conclusions : Survival in young CMML patients is poor and even worse in the presence of SRSF2 or ASXL1 mutations, anemia or circulating blasts. Treatment outcome was more impressive with transplant than it was with HMA and neither was influenced by karyotype or ASXL1 / SRSF2 mutational status.
