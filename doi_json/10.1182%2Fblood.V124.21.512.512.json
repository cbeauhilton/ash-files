    "abstract_text": "Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase supports CML cell survival in part by regulating antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. Tyrosine kinase inhibition, the front-line therapy for patients with chronic phase CML, is less effective in blast crisis (BC) patients and inactive against quiescent CML stem/progenitor cells. We reported that ABT-737, a dual Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor, induces apoptosis in BC CML cells including CD34 + quiescent CML cells. ABT-199, a potent Bcl-2 specific inhibitor, has entered clinical trials for various hematological malignancies. We hypothesized that cooperative targeting of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins using a combination of ABT-199 and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) would exert enhanced activity against BC CML and CML stem/progenitor cells. Cells from patients (n=4) with TKI-resistant BC CML were treated with ABT-199, TKIs, and combinations. Although exerting low activity by itself, ABT-199 in combination with TKIs synergistically induced apoptosis (CI<0.1) in bulk and CD34 + 38 - cells from these patients regardless of their previous clinical responses to TKIs. The combinations had minimal activity against normal CD34 + cells (n=3). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that nilotinib inhibited the expression of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 mRNA and protein, even in cells from TKI (including nilotinib) resistant patients. Individual inhibition of Bcl-xL or Mcl-1, and even more so inhibition of both, by siRNAs increased the sensitivity of cells to ABT-199, suggesting that cooperative inhibition of Bcl-2 by ABT-199 and Bcl-xL/Mcl-1 by TKIs contributes to the synergy. To evaluate the effect of these combinations on TKI-insensitive quiescent stem/progenitor CML cells, BC CML patient cells were stained with the cell division-tracking dye carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and then co-cultured with human bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Once proliferating and quiescent cells were distinguishable by flow cytometry, cells were treated with ABT-199, TKIs, and their combinations for 48 hours with or without MSC co-culture. Apoptosis was measured in proliferating and quiescent progenitor cells, defined as the percentage of annexin V positivity in CD34 + CFSE dim and CD34 + CFSE bright cells, respectively. ABT-199 as a single agent decreased viability of CML cells cultured alone or co-cultured with MSCs in both proliferating (IC 50 =191\u00b1103nM and 194\u00b164nM, respectively) and quiescent (IC 50 =221\u00b175nM and 205\u00b1123nM, respectively) CD34 + CML cells. Combinations of ABT-199 with TKIs, including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, or ponatinib, synergistically induced death (CI<0.2) and decreased the number of viable cells in proliferating as well as quiescent CD34 + progenitor cell populations (n=6). All 6 patients were resistant to TKIs, and 4 had mutations in the BCR-ABL gene, including three with the T315I mutation. To further test the ability of ABT-199 and TKI combinations to eradicate CML stem cells, we used an inducible transgenic CML mouse model in which the BCR-ABL gene is expressed under control of a tet-regulated enhancer of the murine stem cell leukemia (Scl) gene, allowing targeted BCR-ABL expression in stem/progenitor cells. Once BM cells from transgenic Scl-tTa-BCR-ABL/GFP mice were engrafted in wild type recipient mice, the mice were treated with ABT-199, nilotinib, or both. At the end of a 3-week treatment period, each single agent alone, and even more so with the combinations, significantly decreased blood total GFP + WBC (12.9\u00b11.4, 5.2\u00b10.3, 6.1\u00b10.4, and 1.6\u00b10.3 x10 6 /ml in controls, ABT-199, nilotinib, and combination, respectively) and neutrophils (1.43\u00b10.03, 0.49\u00b10.06, 0.32\u00b10.03, and 0.25\u00b10.05 x10 6 /ml in the respective groups). ABT-199 ( P =0.02), and more so with the combination ( P <0.01) but not nilotinib alone ( P =0.29), significantly decreased BM GFP + LSK cells (12.0\u00b11.2, 6.8\u00b10.6, 9.5\u00b11.6, and 2.2\u00b10.2 x10 3 cells in the respective groups). The in vivo experiments are ongoing. Conclusions: ABT-199 and TKIs cooperatively target antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. This combination is highly effective in killing bulk and CD34 + 38 - CML cells and quiescent CD34 + CML stem/progenitor cells from BC CML patients in vitro and in suppressing leukemia and leukemia stem cells in vivo . This strategy has the potential to eradicate BC CML cells and CML stem/progenitor cells, neither of which are effectively targeted by TKIs alone. Disclosures Carter: AbbVie, Inc.: Research Funding.
