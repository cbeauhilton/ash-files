    "abstract_text": "Introduction: DARA is approved for NDMM and previously treated MM. In the primary analysis of the phase 2 GRIFFIN trial (NCT02874742) in autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)-eligible NDMM pts (median follow-up, 13.5 mo), DARA plus RVd (D-RVd) improved the rate of stringent complete response (sCR) by the end of post-ASCT consolidation versus RVd (42.4% vs 32.0%, 1-sided P =0.068) (Voorhees PM, et al. Blood. 2020). With longer follow-up (median, 27.4 mo), responses deepened and were improved for D-RVd versus RVd (sCR rate: 63.6% vs 47.4%, 2-sided P =0.0253), as did the MRD-negativity (10 - 5 ) rate (62.5% vs 27.2%, P <0.0001) (Kaufman JL, et al. Blood. 2020). Here, we present updated efficacy and safety results after 24 months of maintenance therapy or treatment discontinuation (median follow-up, 38.6 mo). Methods: Pts with NDMM eligible for high-dose therapy (HDT) and ASCT were randomized 1:1 to receive RVd or D-RVd, stratified by ISS disease stage (I, II, or III) and creatinine clearance (30-50 or >50 mL/min). Pts received 4 RVd or D-RVd induction cycles, HDT, ASCT, 2 RVd or D-RVd consolidation cycles, and maintenance with lenalidomide (R) alone or with DARA (D-R) for 24 months. During induction and consolidation (21-day cycles), pts received R (25 mg PO on Days 1-14), bortezomib (1.3 mg/m 2 SC on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11), and dexamethasone (40 mg PO QW) \u00b1 DARA (16 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1-4 and Day 1 of Cycles 5-6). During maintenance (Cycles 7-32; 28-day cycles), pts received R (10 mg PO on Days 1-21; if tolerated, 15 mg in Cycle 10+) \u00b1 DARA (16 mg/kg IV) Q8W (or Q4W per pt decision after protocol amendment 2) until disease progression or up to 24 months. The primary endpoint was sCR rate by the end of post-ASCT consolidation (tested at 1-sided \u03b1 of 0.10). Responses were assessed per IMWG criteria by a validated computer algorithm. Key secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and MRD negativity assessed by NGS at the minimum sensitivity threshold of 10 -5 , at suspected complete response or better (\u2265CR), at the end of induction and consolidation, and after 12 and 24 months of maintenance, regardless of response. Secondary analyses were evaluated using 2-sided \u03b1 of 0.05, not adjusted for multiplicity. Results: In total, 207 pts were randomized (D-RVd, n=104; RVd, n=103); baseline characteristics were well balanced. After 24 months of D-R or R maintenance therapy, the rate of sCR favored D-RVd versus RVd in the response-evaluable population (66.0% [66/100] vs 47.4% [46/97], 2-sided P =0.0096; Figure ). In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, MRD-negativity (10 -5 ) rates also remained higher for D-RVd versus RVd (64.4% [67/104] vs 30.1% [31/103], P <0.0001), as well as among pts who achieved \u2265CR (78.0% [64/82] vs 47.5% [28/59], P =0.0003). Similarly, MRD-negativity (10 -6 ) rates favored D-RVd versus RVd in the ITT population (35.6% vs 14.6%, P =0.0007; Figure ), as well as among pts who achieved \u2265CR (42.7% vs 22.0%, P =0.0121). The rate of sustained MRD negativity (10 -5 ) lasting \u226512 months in the ITT population was >3-fold higher for D-RVd versus RVd (44.2% vs 12.6%, P <0.0001). With 38.6 months follow-up, median PFS was not reached in either arm but trended towards favoring D-RVd versus RVd (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.21-1.01; Figure ). The estimated 36-month PFS rate was 88.9% for D-RVd and 81.2% for RVd. In total, 14 pts died (D-RVd, n=7; RVd, n=7), 9 from progressive disease (D-RVd, n=5; RVd, n=4). No new safety concerns were observed with extended follow-up. In total, 86.9% (86/99) of D-RVd pts and 79.4% (81/102) of RVd pts developed grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Serious TEAEs occurred in 46.5% of D-RVd pts and 52.0% of RVd pts. TEAEs led to discontinuation of study treatment at the same rate (D-RVd, 34.3%; RVd, 34.3%). One pt in each group died due to TEAEs, neither related to study treatment. Conclusion: After 24 months of maintenance therapy, the addition of DARA to RVd induction and consolidation in conjunction with ASCT, followed by DARA plus R maintenance, continued to demonstrate deep and durable responses in pts with transplant-eligible NDMM, including sCR and MRD-negativity (10 -5 and 10 -6 ) rates. While this study was not powered for PFS, there is a positive trend towards improved PFS in the D-RVd group. No new safety concerns were observed with longer follow-up. These results support the use of D-RVd induction/consolidation and D-R maintenance in transplant-eligible NDMM pts.
