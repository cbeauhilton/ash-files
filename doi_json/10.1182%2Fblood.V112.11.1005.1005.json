    "abstract_text": "Background: Panobinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that has shown promising results in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Objectives : An open-label, multicenter, Phase II study is being conducted with a primary objective of establishing the efficacy and safety of the pan-deacetylase inhibitor, panobinostat (LBH589), for patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory CTCL with Stage IB\u2013IVA mycosis fungoides (MF) or Se\u0301zary syndrome (SS). Methods: Inclusion criteria include adequate organ function, no clinically significant cardiovascular abnormalities (QTcF \u2264 450 ms, ECOG PS \u22642), failure of \u22652 prior systemic therapies, and no prior HDAC inhibitor treatment. Pts were grouped as having bexarotene therapy (Group [Gr] 1) or bexarotene nai\u0308ve (Gr 2). Panobinostat was administered at a dose of 20 mg orally on Days 1, 3, 5, weekly, every 28 days until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response was based on a composite score, including skin assessment with the modified Severity-Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) and systemic disease assessed by CT scan. Results: To date, 95 pts (Gr 1=62; Gr 2=33) have enrolled with median age of 58 yrs [range 25\u201388]: 58 male, 37 female; 70 MF, 25 SS. Median prior treatment regimens are 4 and 3 for Gr 1 and 2, respectively. Most pts were \u2265Stage IIB at study entry (Gr 1=42; Gr 2=26) and received 1\u201317+ (median=3) treatment cycles of panobinostat. In Gr 1, 11/62 pts have had confirmed skin responses by SWAT, including 2 complete skin responses. Confirmatory CT scans are pending for 2 patients. In Gr 2, 4/33 pts had confirmed skin and CT scan responses. Common AEs (>20%; all grades, regardless of causality) included diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, nausea, pruritus, fatigue, and asthenia, and Grade 3/4 AEs (>2%, regardless of causality) included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pruritus, diarrhea, and hypophosphatemia. Of 4,542 ECGs analyzed, 2 pts have had QTcF >480 ms; 4 had QTcF >60 ms increase from baseline. Conclusions: Panobinostat continues to demonstrate encouraging clinical activity with a manageable safety profile in pts with CTCL. Per predefined criteria, Group 2 enrollment to Stage 2 is open. Updated efficacy and safety data will be presented."
