    "abstract_text": "While different Pediatric ALL study groups have used varying definitions of early response (BM vs. PB, prophase vs. day 7 vs. day 14), all agree that it provides critical prognostic information. Bone Marrow aspiration and biopsy (BMA/B) is an invasive procedure requiring sedation or anesthesia, and an early/mid induction specimen may be difficult to interpret even by experienced hematopathologists. In this study we attempted to determine if there was a concordance between peripheral blood blast (PBB) clearance and the findings of the day 14 BMA/B, and whether day 7 PBB count could reliably replace a mid induction BMA/B. Clinical data for newly diagnosed pediatric (5% blasts in the D14 BMA/B. The D7 PBB count could positively and negatively predict the D14 BMA/B 71.9% and 89.4% of the times, respectively. In conclusion, when the D14 BMA/B is used as a measure of early response, an absence of D7 PBB can reliably predict a negative BM, however persistence of PBB does not necessarily predict a sub-optimal BM response to early therapy. Therefore, patients without PBB on D7 may not require BMA/B on D14, therefore avoiding an invasive procedure for this group of patients."
