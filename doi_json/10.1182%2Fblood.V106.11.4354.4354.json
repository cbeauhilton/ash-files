    "abstract_text": "The Ikaros transcription factor has been shown to play an important role in the differentiation of both the myeloid and lymphoid lineages. The ikaros gene encodes for a zinc finger protein containing seven exons that can be alternatively spliced generating several isoforms with differing functional properties. Isoforms with less than three DNA binding domains act as dominant negative (DN) by forming complexes with longer isoforms and interfering with their DNA binding and transcriptional activation ability. Mice heterozygous for a DN ikaros isoform develop T cell leukemia and lymphoma with 100% penetrance. Overexpression of DN Ikaros isoforms has been found in some forms of leukemias. We have previously reported overexpression of the DN Ikaros6 (Ik6) isoform in a subset of leukemia patients harboring t(4;11) translocations. In addition, we inducibly expressed Ik6 in BaF3 cells and found that Ik6 overexpression delayed cell death after IL-3 withdrawal. To further investigate the leukemogenic properties of Ik6 overexpression, we have transduced murine hematopoietic precursors with a retroviral Ik6 expression vector and have analysed the effects on proliferation and differentiation of these precursors by in vitro colony formation assays. We have found that Ik6 can immortalize murine hematopopietic precursors in these in vitro assays. We are currently analysing the leukemogenic potential of Ik6 in vivo by transplanting Ik6 expressing cell lines into NOD/SCID mice.",
