    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1692 Poster Board I-718 Transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a key regulator of NF-kB activation. TAK1 can be activated by a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and T and B cell receptors. Recent experiments demonstrated that deletion of TAK1 results in inactivation of both JNK and NF-kB signaling resulting in massive apoptotic death of hematopoietic cells in mice. In this study, we examined the expression pattern of TAK1 and its role as a potential therapeutic target for lymphoma. First, we examined TAK1 expression in a panel of lymphoid cell lines by western blot, and found it to be highly expressed in mantle cell lymphoma cell lines (Mino, SP53, and Jeko-1). These lines expressed relatively low levels of the tumor suppressor protein A20. Mino and SP53 expressed high level of p-p38. Subsequently, we investigated the in vitro activity of the novel TAK1 small molecule inhibitor AZ-Tak1 in these cell lines. AZ-Tak1 is a potent and a relatively selective inhibitor of TAK1 kinase activity, with an IC50 of 0.009 mM. It also inhibits Jak2 but at a much higher concentration (IC50=0.18 mM). AZ-Tak1 treatment decreased the level of p38 and ERK in mantle cell lymphoma cells, and induced apoptosis in a dose and time dependent manner, with an IC50 of 0.1-0.5 mM. Using the annexin-V and PI staining and FACS analysis, After 48 hours of incubation, AZ-Tak1 (0.1 mM) induced apoptosis in 28%, 34% and 86% of Mino, SP53, and Jeko cells, respectively, which was increased to 32%, 42%, and 86% when 0.5 mM concentration was used. Similar activity was also observed when primary mantle cell lymphoma cells were examined. Using pathway-specific protein arrays focusing on apoptosis, kinases, and transcription factors, AZ-Tak1 (0.5 mM) altered the level of several proteins that regulate cell growth and survival, especially members of the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family. Specifically, AZ-Tak1 decreased the level of SMAC/DIABOLO and cytochrome \u2013C in the mitochondria, which was associated with a decrease in the level of the anti-apoptotic protein X-linked IAP (XIAP) and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway as evident by activation of caspase 9, cleavage of caspase 3, and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, and consistant with its ability to inhibit Jak2 activity, AZ-Tak1 reduced STAT2 and STAT6 levels. AZ-Tak1 demonstrated no significant effect on bcl-2 family members. Finally, co-treatment with HDAC inhibitors demonstrated synergistic effect with low concentrations of AZ-Tak1. Collectively, our data demonstrate that targeting TAK1 by the small molecule inhibitor AZ-Tak1 induces cell death in mantle cell lymphoma by activating the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, suggesting that targeting TAK1 may have a therapeutic value for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma.
