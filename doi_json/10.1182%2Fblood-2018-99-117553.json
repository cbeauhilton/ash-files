    "abstract_text": "Studying gene expression and clinical outcome data from 136 clinical trials for patients with cancer (~21,000 patients with 26 cancer types), we found CD25 as one of the strongest predictors of poor clinical outcome in patients with B-cell malignancies, but not in other cancer types. This was unexpected because CD25 is known as one of three chains of the IL2 receptor on T-cells and NK-cells. Interleukin-2 (IL2) functions as essential T-cell growth factor. IL2 signals through \u03b2- and \u03b3-, but not \u03b1-chains (CD25) of its heterotrimeric receptor. CD25-deficiency causes lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity, however, its mechanistic role is unclear. Our experiments based on genetic mouse models and engineered patient-derived B-cell leukemia and lymphoma xenografts revealed that CD25 expressed on B-cells is not an IL2 receptor chain, but in fact binds the B-cell receptor (BCR) to regulate its activity. Suggesting IL2-independent functions, defects in CD25 - / - B-cells were not replicated in IL2-deficient mice. CD25 bound the BCR but not IL2R\u03b2- and IL2R\u03b3-chains. IL2R\u03b2- and IL2R\u03b3-chains can pair with other chains to form receptors for different cytokine-ligands. However, CD25 represents the first example of a cytokine receptor chain that binds to the BCR for negative feedback regulation. Likewise, in T-cells, CD25 had a bifunctional role and either functioned as IL2 receptor chain or as negative feedback regulator of T-cell receptor signaling. CD25-function was regulated by cell-membrane translocation, which required phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic tail at S268 ( see schematic, left ). In a family with monogenic autoimmunity, a mutation immediately preceding S268 compromised CD25-surface translocation, which was restored by homology-directed repair of the S268 motif. CD25-interactome analyses identified PKCd as critical effector molecule downstream of CD25 to mediate B-cell selection during normal B-cell development and calibrate oncogenic BCR signaling in B-cell tumors. In B-cell malignancies, BCR-dependent survival and proliferation signals are often substituted by oncogenic BCR-mimics (e.g. BCR-ABL1 , JAK2 , BRAF V600E , LMP2A, CD79B mutations; see schematic, right ). Accordingly, we identified CD25 surface-expression as biomarker of oncogenic BCR-signaling and predictor of poor clinical outcomes. CD25 - / - B-cell leukemia failed to initiate fatal disease in transplant recipients. Owing to imbalances of oncogenic BCR-signaling and p53-checkpoint activation, CD25 -/- B-cell leukemia failed to initiate fatal disease in transplant recipients. In patient-derived xenograft models of drug-resistant B-cell malignancies, treatment with a CD25-specific antibody drug-conjugate (ADCT-301) extended survival of transplant recipients or eradicated disease. These findings identified CD25 as previously unrecognized feedback regulator of oncogenic BCR-signaling and provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of CD25 in refractory B-cell malignancies.
