    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory AML have dismal outcomes with currently available chemotherapy regimens. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the use of hypomethylating agents such as decitabine prior to standard chemotherapy may be synergistic (Qin et al. Clin Can Res 2007; Scandura et al. Blood 2011; Clozel et al. Cancer Discov 2013). Methods: Pts aged \u226518 to 65 years with relapsed or refractory AML (up to salvage 2) were eligible. Prior therapy with hypomethylating agents was allowed. The chemotherapy regimen was as follows: Table  . Dose . Days . INDUCTION    Decitabine 20 mg/m 2 IV Days 1-5 Clofarabine 15 mg/m 2 IV Days 6-9 (Dose level 1) Days 6-10 (Dose level 2) Idarubicin 10 mg/m 2 IV Days 6-8 Cytarabine 1 gm/m 2 IV Days 6-10 CONSOLIDATION    Decitabine 20 mg/m 2 IV Days 1-5 Clofarabine 15 mg/m 2 IV Days 6-8 Idarubicin 8 mg/m 2 IV Days 6-7 Cytarabine 1 gm/m 2 IV Days 6-8 . Dose . Days . INDUCTION    Decitabine 20 mg/m 2 IV Days 1-5 Clofarabine 15 mg/m 2 IV Days 6-9 (Dose level 1) Days 6-10 (Dose level 2) Idarubicin 10 mg/m 2 IV Days 6-8 Cytarabine 1 gm/m 2 IV Days 6-10 CONSOLIDATION    Decitabine 20 mg/m 2 IV Days 1-5 Clofarabine 15 mg/m 2 IV Days 6-8 Idarubicin 8 mg/m 2 IV Days 6-7 Cytarabine 1 gm/m 2 IV Days 6-8 View Large Results: Eighteenpts (female, n=4) have been treated so far. Median age was 43 years (range 20-61). Majority of the pts (10/18, 56%) were in salvage 2. Four had a prior allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT). Cytogenetics were diploid (n=4), complex (n=11), 11q abnormality (n=2), trisomy 8 (n=1). Five pts had a TP53 mutation and 3 pts had an NRAS mutation. Median number of cycles administered was 1 (range 1-2). Grade 3-4 non-hematological toxicity included grade 3 mucositis (DLT) in 2 pts during the induction cycle. Due to mucositis and prolonged cytopenias (prolonged cytopenias didn\u2019t meet the DLT definition), dose level 2 was not pursued, and all patients were treated at dose level 1. Grade 3 transaminitis was seen in 4 pts. Fifteen pts had one or more infections. Six (33%) pts achieved CR, of whom 5 were able to proceed to SCT (one pt with CR opted not to pursue SCT). Median time to CR was 35 days. An additional 3 pts had a >50% decrease in bone marrow blast count (marrow response) and all three proceeded with SCT. All 4 patients with diploid cytogenetics achieved CR. Only 1/5 (20%) patients with mutated TP53 achieved a CR. Two patients have relapsed (one 3 months after SCT and the other after consolidation cycle 1). Six patients are alive (4 after stem cell transplant, 2 are receiving further salvage regimens after DAC-CIA failure). Median survival of the entire group is 7.2 months (see figure 1 ). Conclusions: The sequential treatment of decitabine followed by chemotherapy is safe and effective with a CR rate of 33% and with 8/18 patients able to proceed to an allogeneic SCT. The phase II part of the study is enrolling patients at this time.
