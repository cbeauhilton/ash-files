    "abstract_text": "Time- and tissue-specific expression of transgenes is essential for the accurate representation of human disease in in vivo models. To improve flexibility but also fidelity of ALK+ ALCL models, we developed new approaches enabling lineage specific expression of NPM-ALK cDNAs, as well as a novel system for CRISPR/Cas induced Npm-Alk recombination. First, we have designed a new system for lineage-restricted expression of transgenes based on a retroviral vector incorporating a translational stop-cassette flanked by loxP recombination sites. Conditional transgene expression in chimeric mice is rapidly achieved through retroviral infection and subsequent transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) derived from transgenic mice expressing Cre-recombinase from a lineage specific promoter. To validate the model, we directed expression of NPM-ALK, the fusion oncogene present in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), to T-cells by infecting hematopoietic stem cells from Lck-Cre transgenic mice with a retroviral construct containing the Npm-Alk cDNA preceded by a translational stop cassette. The approach efficiently induced T-cell lymphomas within 12-16 weeks closely resembling the human disease including the expression of the ALCL hallmark antigen CD30. Since NPM-ALK overexpressed from a cDNA acts as a very strong oncogene transforming a range of cell types, we were interested to develop a more physiologic model based on chromosomal recombination, enabling NPM-ALK expression from the endogenous Npm promoter. To achieve this, we have designed guide RNAs (gRNAs) directed to either the intron between exon 4 and 5 for Npm1 on mouse chr. 11, or the intron between exons 19 and 20 for Alk on mouse chr. 17., enabling targeted translocation between the two chromosomes. For further analysis, the IL-3 dependent murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 stably expressing the Cas9 recombinase was transduced with the respective gRNAs and subsequently grown in the absence of IL-3 to allow positive selection of cells transformed by productive t(11;17) NA recombination. A PCR reaction on genomic DNA using primers covering the translocation breakpoint resulted in a product and Sanger sequencing of the amplicon confirmed the intended recombination at the targeted genomic positions. The translocation was also detectable by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), and Western blot analysis demonstrated expression of a highly phosphorylated Npm-Alk fusion protein. To further probe for oncogene dependency, we treated Npm-Alk translocated cells and control cells with a specific Alk inhibitor, resulting in rapid cell depletion of the Npm-Alk translocated cells, but not controls. The described Cre/loxP-based system represents a versatile tool for the rapid functional analysis of gene function in a defined lineage or in a developmental stage in vivo , and faithfully recapitulates many features of ALCL. Furthermore, using Crispr/Cas to induce targeted double-strand breaks, we have been able to generate specific Npm-Alk translocations in murine cells, paving the way for novel models which may help to further define the initial pathogenetic event underlying lymphomagenesis in ALCL.
