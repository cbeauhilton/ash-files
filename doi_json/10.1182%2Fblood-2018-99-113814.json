    "abstract_text": "Background: Marginal zone Lymphoma (MZL) is the third most abundant lymphoma and it is subclassified into 3 entities: splenic, nodal and extranodal mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Positron emission tomography (PET) using 18 F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with computed tomography (CT) is increasingly used for staging and response assessment of FDG avid lymphomas, such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. The role of PET/CT in lymphomas with variable FDG avidity, such as MZL, is still under active research. Aims: The purpose of this study was to evaluate PET/CT as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in patients with MZL. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed MZL, treated with immunotherapy, chemotherapy regimen, surgery or eradication between 2008 and 2016 in a single tertiary center. Patients who did not undergo pre-treatment PET/CT (P-PET/CT) were excluded. Patients were identified through the hospital's computerized database. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected from patients' files until the latest follow-up available and for at least 12 months after completion of treatment administration. P-PET/CT, interim (I-PET/CT) and end-of-treatment PET/CT (E-PET/CT) studies were centrally reviewed by a nuclear specialist and reported using 3 methods of evaluation: visual assessment, maximal SUV reported and Deauville 5-point score (DS) evaluation (DS only for I-PET/CT and E-PET/CT). PET/CT was interpreted as positive if any of the three evaluation methods was positive. The primary outcome was to evaluate the prognostic role of P-PET/CT, I-PET/CT and E-PET/CT on progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Survival curve was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression. Models adjusted for age, sex, and stage were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used for the association between PET/CT positivity, PFS and OS. Results: Data of 196 patients with MZL were identified. 86 patients were excluded due to absence of P-PET/CT. Thus, 110 patients were included in this analysis. The most frequent histological type of MZL was MALT (51%). Median patients' age was 67 years (range: 18-93). The median follow-up period was 63 months (range: 3-278). 54/110 (73%) presented with bone marrow involvement and 100/110 (91%) had extranodal involvement. MZL transformed to an aggressive lymphoma in 3% of the patients. The median OS and PFS for the whole cohort were 63 months (interquartile range: 39-85) and 60 months (interquartile range: 37-76), respectively. 77/110 (71.3%) patients had positive P-PET/CT. Among 19 patients that had I-PET/CT, eight studies were positive and 11 negative. 63/110 patients underwent E-PET/CT: 12 studies were positive and 51 negative. P-PET/CT and I-PET/CT were not predictive of PFS or OS. Sub-group analysis of the different types of MZL did not show such a correlation as well. When adjusted for age, sex and stage, positive E-PET/CT was associated with reduced PFS with a hazard ratio (HR) of 4.16 (CI 1.55-11.2, p=0.005) (Figure 1). Conversely, positive E-PET/CT did not correlate with OS maybe due to the low death rate (3 patients). In a univariate analysis, beta 2 microglobulin was prognostic for PFS with and adjusted HR of 1.44 (CI 1.08-1.94, p-0.014). Conclusions: Our study shows that above 70% of MZL are FDG avid. P-PET/CT and I-PET/CT were not predictive of PFS; However, E- PET/CT was predictive of PFS with an adjusted HR of 4.2.
