    "abstract_text": "The cytokine interleukin-7 (IL-7) is required for B and T lymphocyte development, and for the survival and maintenance of both naive and memory T lymphocytes. The receptor for IL-7 (IL-7R) is heterodimeric, consisting of a common gamma chain (\u03b3c) and an alpha subunit (IL-7R\u03b1). The \u03b3c is expressed in most hematopoietic cell types, but the IL-7R\u03b1 gene is regulated in a cell type and developmental stage-specific manner. We have previously shown that the Ets-family transcription factor PU.1 is required to activate transcription of the IL-7R\u03b1 gene during fetal lymphocyte development. However, several questions remain unanswered. First, the IL-7R\u03b1 promoter is poorly characterized. Second, the IL-7R\u03b1 is expressed at high levels in the T cell lineage where PU.1 is not expressed. Third, the transcription factor early B cell factor (EBF) can activate IL-7R\u03b1 transcription in developing B cells in the absence of PU.1. To address these questions, we have characterized the IL-7R\u03b1 promoter region in detail. First, we determined that the major transcription start sites in the IL-7R\u03b1 gene are downstream of an Ets/PU.1 binding site. We found that the intact Ets site is required for IL-7R\u03b1 promoter activity, as well as to mediate enhancer action from a distance. IL-7R\u03b1 promoter activity depends on the proper orientation of the Ets site relative to functional initiator sequences. We found, using gel shift analysis, that both PU.1 and the Ets transcription factor GA binding protein (GABP) are expressed in developing B cells, and can interact with the Ets binding site in the IL-7R\u03b1 promoter. However, the function of PU.1 is distinct from GABP during B cell development. Retroviral transduction of PU.1 mutant progenitor cells with a PU.1 retrovirus robustly rescues IL-7R\u03b1 transcription and IL-7-dependent B cell development. In contrast, transduction with GABP\u03b1 and GABP\u03b21 subunits fails to activate IL-7R\u03b1 transcription in PU.1 mutant progenitor cells. We conclude that activation of the IL-7R\u03b1 gene requires PU.1 during the earliest stages of lymphocyte development, but is alternatively utilized by PU.1 and GABP after commitment to the B cell lineage.",
