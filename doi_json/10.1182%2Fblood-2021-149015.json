    "abstract_text": "Inappropriate expression of Ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) has been associated with dismal clinical outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), while EVI1 is indispensable for normal hematopoiesis. We have previously reported that EVI1 expression is restricted to hematopoietic stem cell fraction and EVI1-expressing cells show robust long-term reconstitution capacity using Evi1-IRES-GFP knock-in (EVI1-GFP) mice, which enable us to track Evi1 expression on a single cell basis. In this study, we tried to elucidate the functional implication of EVI1 expression in AML using these mice. We generated murine EVI1-GFP AML model by retrovirally transducing MLL-AF9 or -ENL fusion gene into Lineage- Sca-1+ c-kit+ (LSK) cells from EVI1-GFP mice followed by transplantation into lethally irradiated syngeneic mice. Clonogenic and leukemogenic potentials of AML cells, especially leukemic cells with a granulocyte-macrophage progenitor phenotype (L-GMPs) from these mice, were compared according to GFP expression. Remarkably, GFP-positive L-GMPs tended to show lower colony-forming activity in semi-solid media and lower leukemia-initiating potential than GFP-negative L-GMPs. GFP-positive L-GMPs, however, induced a more aggressive form of AML, characterized by shorter survival in the secondary transplantation model. When EVI1-GFP AML mice underwent cytotoxic chemotherapy with cytarabine, the GFP-positive fraction was enriched during myelosuppression, indicating the survival advantage of EVI1-positive cells. To investigate the downstream target of EVI1, we employed murine EVI1-AML model, where murine hematopoietic cells exogenously expressing 3\u00d7FLAG-tagged EVI1 were transplanted into syngeneic mice. Using EVI1-AML cells, we performed chromatin-immunoprecipitation coupled to next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) by anti-FLAG tag antibody. To identify leukemia-specific targets of EVI1, the result was compared with the result of ChIP-seq obtained from 32D-cl3 murine hematopoietic progenitor cells with 3\u00d7FLAG tag inserted into 3'-end of the coding region of the EVI1 gene. Gene ontology analysis revealed that genes involved in immune processes are explicitly enriched in the leukemia samples. Among the list of EVI1-bound genes, we tried to refine functional downstream targets of EVI1, which are upregulated in murine EVI1-AML cells and of which expressions are positively correlated with EVI1. By combining the ChIP-seq data with murine transcriptome data that compare hematopoietic progenitor cells expressing empty-vector and EVI1+ AML cells, and public gene expression datasets of human AML (Valk et al. NEJM 2004), we picked out 18 genes as candidate EVI1 downstream genes. Functional screening using EVI1-AML cells and shRNAs against these genes revealed that silencing of ETS transcription factor ERG (ETS-related gene) markedly suppressed proliferation and colony-forming activity of EVI1-AML cells, as well as rendered them vulnerable to cytotoxic agents. Normal c-kit+ hematopoietic progenitor cells were less affected by shRNAs against ERG. By comparing MLL-ENL immortalized murine hematopoietic cells with high and low EVI1 expression, EVI1-high MLL-ENL cells showed higher ERG dependency than EVI1-low MLL-ENL cells. Pharmacological inhibition of ERG also led to marked inhibition of EVI1-AML cells and EVI1-high MLL-ENL cells. Finally, knockdown of ERG remarkably delayed AML development in bone marrow transplantation model of EVI1-AML and EVI1-expressing MLL-ENL AML. Our data suggest that EVI1-positive AML cells are characterized by an aggressive nature and resistance to cytotoxic agents, as well as low leukemia stem cell capacity. ERG would be a novel downstream target of EVI1, on which survival of EVI1-expressing AML cells depends.
