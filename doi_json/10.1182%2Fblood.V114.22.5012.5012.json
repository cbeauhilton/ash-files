    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5012 Identical twins are an excellent model in which to study tumor-specific immune responses (Gitelson et al Br J Haem 2002) as it can be postulated that the immune systems are identical. Spontaneous remissions in FL occur but the immunologic mechanisms remain elusive. We investigated adaptive and innate immunologic phenotypes and responses in a 41-year old patient with untreated grade 1 FL, and her healthy identical twin sister. Patients and methods The patient has had a waxing and waning course of FL over 7 years and currently is in spontaneous partial remission (> 50% reduction of generalized lymphadenopathy) and her peripheral blood was negative for t(14:18) by PCR at the time of this analysis. Immunologic responses of her twin, as well as another set of healthy identical twin sisters, were investigated as controls. We studied peripheral blood using 8-color multiparametric flow cytometry for frequencies and phenotypes of NK and regulatory T cells (Tregs). FOXP3+ cells were further analyzed for nai\u0308ve, central memory and effector memory phenotype. Activation of NK cells and degranulation in response to tumor target cells as measured by Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1 (LAMP-1) surface expression were investigated. An erythroblastoid cell line (K562) and an EBV transformed MHC-I deficient lymphoblastoid cell line (721.221) were used as targets. Results NK studies revealed that activated CD69+ NK cells were increased in percentage in FL patient (4.43%) compared to her healthy twin (1.82%), and had increased mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 1057 vs 357, respectively. In contrast, almost identical frequencies and MFI of activated NK cells were found in the set of healthy twins (0.55% vs 0.54% and 153 vs 153, respectively). NK cells of FL patient exhibited elevated degranulation compared to the healthy twin in response to stimulation by either target cell: LAMP-1 staining MFI 1907 vs 1395, respectively for 721.221 target cells and 1394 vs 1122, respectively for K562 cells, whereas no difference was detected in non-stimulated NK cells (MFI 536 vs 506, respectively). In addition, Killer Cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIR) analysis revealed a deficit in the percentage of NK cells staining with an antibody recognizing KIR2DL1/S1 in the patient, but not in her healthy twin (7.0% vs 15.1% of NK cells, respectively), whereas no other differences in KIR receptor expression profiles were found for other KIR or in comparing the set of healthy twins. Analysis of frequencies of circulating Tregs revealed no difference between FL patient and her healthy twin: CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ cells represented 4.92% vs 5.78%, respectively of total CD4 cells and CD8+CD25+FOXP3+ cells represented 1.25% vs 1.37%, respectively of total CD8 cells. Analysis of T cell subsets revealed that Tregs in FL patient and in her twin were mainly of effector memory phenotype: CCR7-/CD45RA-/CD45RO+ (82.6% vs 74.4%, respectively) and central memory phenotype: CCR7+/CD45RA-/CD45RO+ (10.7 vs 14.3%, respectively). Conclusions NK cell studies of FL patient revealed increased numbers of activated CD69+ NK cells which correlated with increased degranulation response to tumor target cells and a deficit in the NK cell repertoire, as noted by the deficiency in NK cells expressing KIR2DL1/S1 in the patient compared to the healthy twin, while no differences in frequencies of circulating Tregs or Treg phenotypes were identified. Although the current results are based upon a single sampling, due to limited availability, the observed potentiation of NK cell activity in the patient with FL suggest a potentially important role of NK cells in tumor control during spontaneous partial remission. Follow-up studies of persisting remission, temporary flare-up or at disease progression will be of interest. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
