    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) are in daily demand worldwide because of their ability to replenish entire blood system. However, the in vitro expansion of HSPC is still a major challenge since the cues from bone marrow microenvironment remain largely elusive. Signals coming from the bone marrow niche, and specifically mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPC), orchestrate maintenance, trafficking and stage specific differentiation of HSPCs. Although, it is generally accepted that MSPCs are essential for hematopoietic homeostasis and generating multiple types of stromal cells, the exact transcriptional networks regulating MSPCs are not well established. Early B-cell factor 1 (Ebf1) has been discovered as lineage-specific transcription factor governing B lymphopoiesis. Additionally, it has been shown to play important role in differentiation of adipocytes, which are a niche component supporting hematopoietic regeneration. Thus, in this study we seek to examine if Ebf1 has an alternative function in non-hematopoietic compartment of bone marrow, specifically in mesenchymal stromal cells that maintain proper hematopoiesis. Here, we identified Ebf1 as new transcription regulator of MSPCs activity. Mesenchymal progenitors isolated from Ebf1 -/- mice show diminished capacity to form fibroblasticcolonies (CFU-F) indicating reduced self-renewal. Moreover, cells expanded from these colonies display impaired in vitro differentiation towards osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes. In order to test how this defective MSPCs influence maintenance of HSPCs, we performed long-term culture-initiating cell assay (LTC-IC). After 5 weeks of co-culture of Ebf1-deficient stromal cells with wild type HSPCs we could observe significantly decreased number of cobblestone and CFU colonies formed by primitive HSPCs, in comparison to co-cultures with control stromal cells. Furthermore, in vivo adoptive transfers of wild type HSPCs to Ebf1 +/- recipient mice showed a decrease in the absolute numbers of HSPCs in primary recipients and reduced donor chimerism within the HSCP compartment in competitive secondary transplant experiments. Additionally, Prx1-Cre-mediated deletion of Ebf1 specifically in MSPCs of mice leads to reduced frequency and numbers of HSPCs and myeloid cells in the bone marrow. These results confirm that mesenchymal stromal cells lacking Ebf1 render insufficient support for HSPCs to sustain proper hematopoiesis. Interestingly, we also observed a reduced ability of HSPCs sorted from Prx1 Cre Ebf1 fl/fl mice to form colonies in methylcellulose, suggesting not only impaired maintenance but also hindered function of these cells. Moreover, HSPCs exposed to Ebf1-deficient niche exhibit changes in chromatin accessibility with reduced occupancy of AP-1, ETS, Runx and IRF motifs, which is consistent with decreased myeloid output seen in Prx1 Cre Ebf1 fl/fl mice. These results support the hypothesis that defective niche can cause epigenetic reprograming of HSPCs. Finally, single cell and bulk transcriptome analysis of MSPCs lacking Ebf1 revealed differences in the niche composition and decreased expression of lineage-instructive signals for myeloid cells. Thus, our study establishes Ebf1 as a novel regulator of MSPCs playing a crucial role in the maintenance and differentiation of HSPCs. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
