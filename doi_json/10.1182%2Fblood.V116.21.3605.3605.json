    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3605 CLL is a malignant B-cell disorder characterized by the accumulation of small B lymphocytes with a mature appearance in blood, marrow and lymph nodes. Despite effective treatment options, all patients with CLL will eventually relapse after therapy. This could be due in part to the presence of subclones of the CLL cell population that harbor genetic abnormalities, which confer resistance to treatment. The aims of this study were to investigate the clonal evolution in longitudinal samples of CLL patients and to identify genetic alterations associated with disease progression and resistance to therapy. Sequential analyses were performed in 51 samples from 23 patients who were included in a previously reported clinical trial of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (PCR) given every 3 weeks for 6 cycles in previously untreated CLL (Blood 109:2007). In all cases the first sample analyzed was prior to therapy. In 5 of 23 patients, three time points were analyzed: >6 months prior to entry onto PCR trial ( time point A ), just before starting with the PCR regimen ( time point B ), and the time of relapse after PCR trial ( time point C ). Seven patients were analyzed at time points A and B; 9 at time points B and C and 2 at time points A and C. The median time between points A and B was 17.5 months (range 8\u201348 months) and between points B and C was 20.5 months (7\u201360 m). All samples were examined by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) using the Agilent Sureprint G3 (1 million probe) array. aCGH findings were confirmed by interphase FISH using probes for D13S319 ( MIR16\u20131 / MIR15A ), RB1 , MDM2 , CEP12, CEP6, MYB, TP53, NFKBIA, PERP and FGFR1 loci. Overall, we observed a small increase in the number of copy-number abnormalities (CNA) with disease progression. Twenty-two of the 23 patients with paired samples harbored at least one CNA that persisted in all samples, indicating clonal relationship between the sequential samples. In 15 of the 23 patients the tumor clone was stable and no CNA differences between time points were identified. Conversely, genomic evolution was found in 8 patients. In 3 cases the genetic differences were observed pre treatment (between time points A and B) and in the other 5 cases, the observed changes were found after therapy (between time points A and C or between B and C). One remarkable case with genome evolution exhibited two subclones sharing trisomies 12 and 19, but with several unique CNA confined to each subclone. The first subclone was characterized by deletions of 6q, RB1 , MIR16-1 / MIR15A and 3 other losses, while the second subclone showed homozygous deletion of MIR16\u20131 / MIR15A and 5 other monoallelic deletions. The first subclone was predominant at time points A and B (60\u201370% of cells), but was present in only 10\u201320% of cells at time point C as confirmed by FISH. Conversely, the second subclone was observed in ~20% of cells at time points A and B and became predominant after therapy, found in ~80% of cells at time point C. Another case was characterized by deletion 11q32 (including ATM and others) as the sole abnormality at time point B. Significant genomic complexity was observed at time point C, including deletions of 11q32, 9p21 ( CDKN2A ), 9q12-q33, 14q13.2 ( NFKBIA ) and 17p ( TP53 ), and gains of 2p16 ( REL ) and 9q34. Interestingly, the deletion 11q32 from both time points arose independently at each time point, as they exhibited different chromosomal breakpoints and copy number variants. Moreover, the other CNA found at relapse were not identified at diagnosis (confirmed by aCGH and FISH). For evolution of specific CNA, trisomy 12 was found in 5 cases at the first sample analyzed and was stable with no changes between time points. The frequency of deletions 13q14.3 ( MIR16-1/MIR15A ) and 17p increased at the later time points. Conversely, \u20136q decreased in frequency across time points (3 cases in time points A\u2013B and 1 case in time point C). In summary, at least 35% of CLL patients exhibited clonal evolution and at least 9% showed evidence of multiple subclones. This subgroup of CLL patients provides an exceptional framework for comprehensive analysis of genome evolution during disease progression before and after therapy. Our observations also support the hypothesis of a common CLL progenitor cell can give rise to clonally related, but genetically evolving subpopulations of tumor cells. Finally, this study may bring novel information regarding the drug resistance pathways utilized by CLL B cell clones post therapy.
