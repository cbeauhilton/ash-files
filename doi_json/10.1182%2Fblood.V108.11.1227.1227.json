    "abstract_text": "Gene therapy and stem cell transplantation are attractive potential therapies for sickle cell disease (SCD). Previous studies have shown that the sickle environment is highly enriched for reactive oxygen species (ROS), but have not addressed whether or not the increased ROS may alter the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment or affect stem cell function. Using the Berkeley sickle mouse model, we examined the effects of sickle cell disease on hematopoietic stem cell function and the bone marrow microenvironment. We transplanted C57BL/6 (control) BM into C57BL/6 and homozygous sickle mice. Recipients received 2 \u00d7 10 6 BM cells and a conditioning regimen consisting of busulfan, anti-asialo GM1, and co-stimulation blockade (anti-CD40L and CTLA4-Ig). Following transplantation, sickle mice demonstrated increased donor cell engraftment in the peripheral blood compared to normal mice (58.3% vs. 33.1%, respectively). Similarly, BMT in a fully allogeneic system also resulted in enhanced engraftment in sickle recipients. Next we analyzed whether or not engraftment defects exist within the BM stem cell population of sickle mice. In vitro colony forming assays showed a significant decrease in progenitor colony formation in sickle compared to control BM. By flow cytometry, we determined that there was a significant decrease in the KSL (c-Kit + , Sca-1 + , Lineage \u2212 ) progenitor population within the BM of sickle mice. Cell cycle analysis of the KSL population demonstrated that significantly fewer sickle KSL cells were in G 0 phase compared to control, suggesting that there are fewer quiescent stem cells in the BM of sickle mice. To assess the potential role of ROS and glutathione depletion in sickle mice, we tested the engraftment efficiency of KSL cells from untreated and n-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) treated control, hemizygous sickle (hemi), and sickle mice in a competitive repopulation experiment. Peripheral chimerism showed an engraftment defect from both hemizygous and homozygous sickle mice such that control KSL cells engrafted > hemi > sickle at a ratio of 1 : 0.4 : 0.25. Treatment with NAC for four months prior to transplantation partially restored KSL engraftment (control : hemi : sickle; 1 : 0.97 : 0.56 ). We have demonstrated that congenic and allogeneic BMT into sickle mice result in increased donor cell engraftment in the sickle recipients. Both the decreased number of KSL cells and the decreased percentage of quiescent KSL cells in the sickle mice indicate that more stem cells in the transgenic sickle mouse model are mobilized from the BM environment. The engraftment defect of sickle KSL cells that was partially ameliorated by NAC treatment suggests that an altered redox environment in sickle mice may contribute to the engraftment deficiencies that we observed."
