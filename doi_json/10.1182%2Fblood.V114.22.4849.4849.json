    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4849 Many patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) experience cytopenias that require blood product support. The extent to which MDS patients utilize blood products following diagnosis is unknown. The objective of this study was to characterize the use of blood products among recently diagnosed MDS patients in western Washington State. Records from the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry for western Washington State were searched for patients diagnosed with MDS between 2001 and 2007. These records were linked to Puget Sound Blood Center (PSBC) database records. The PBSC is the major supplier of blood products for the Washington SEER region. SEER identified a total of 781 newly diagnosed patients during 2001-2007. The average age was 72.84, 76% were over age 65 and 55% were over age 75. Fifty-eight percent were male and 88% were white race. The most common MDS subtypes included refractory anemia (24%) and refractory anemia with excess blasts (21%); 33% had no specified subtype. Three hundred seventy-six patients (48%) received at least one blood product within 12 months of diagnosis; packed red blood cells (RBCs) (n=361 persons) and platelets (n=222 persons) were most commonly transfused. Among those receiving at least one transfusion of RBCs or one transfusion of platelets respectively, patients received an average of 15.40 units of RBCs and 15.37 units of platelets over 12 months from diagnosis; of these patients, the highest quartile used an average of 39.84 RBCs and 33.81 platelets per person. The proportion of MDS patients receiving any RBCs within 12 months of diagnosis increased from 24% in 2001 to 54% in 2007. Platelet use within 12 months of diagnosis increased from 12% of patients in 2001 to 39% in 2007. Among those receiving at least one platelet transfusion or at least one red blood cell transfusion within 12 months of diagnosis the number of products transfused increased over time, from an average of 8.00 platelet units (SD 5.77) and 8.85 units of RBCs (SD 11.21) in 2001 to 14.12 platelet units (SD 20.31) and 15.98 units RBCs (SD 19.35) in 2007 (p<0.0001, p<0.0001, respectively). Approximately half of newly diagnosed MDS patients receive at least one blood product in the first 12 months following diagnosis. Blood product use has increased substantially from 2001 to 2007, in terms of both the proportion of patients receiving them and the number of transfusions per person. Further study is needed to determine the factors leading to more aggressive use of blood products in these patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
