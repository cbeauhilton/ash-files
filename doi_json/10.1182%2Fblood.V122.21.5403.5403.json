    "abstract_text": "Introduction The best induction regimen for first-line therapy in multiple myeloma patients who are eliglible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is still unknown. In 2009, we started to use CyBorD and gradually changed our first-line therapy from Vel-Dex to CyBorD based on published work from Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto. Here, we describe the first 10 patients to have received CyBorD and compare them to an historical cohort from the same institution. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of patient\u2019s charts and transplant database from 2009/10/02 to 2013/04/19. We collected information on blood labs, cytogenetics, immunofixation, response rates, adverse events and graft collection. Patients not receiving the anticipated protocol or less than 3 cycles of treatment arm were excluded from this review. Results All patients (100%) in both cohorts received an ASCT (CyBorD, n=10 and Vel-Dex, n=11). The 2 groups were comparable and there was 1 patient in each arm with unfavorable cytogenetics. The response rates pre ASCT were CR = 20%, >VGPR = 90% compared to CR = 0%, >VGPR = 81,8% in CyBorD and Vel-Dex patients respectively. Response rates at 100 days post-ASCT was CR = 60%, >VGPR = 100% compared to CR = 36.4%, >VGPR = 90.9% in CyBorD and Vel-Dex patients respectively. Patients in CyBorD had a median of 1 (1-2) day for graft collection and a median number of graft cells of 5,01 x 10 9 (2,06-6,48) compared to 1 (1-2) and 4,46 x 10 9 (3-6,82) in the Vel-Dex group. The rate of grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 0%(n=0) vs 9%(n=1) in CyborD and Vel-Dex patients respectively. No case of neuropathy grade 3 or 4 was observed in the CyBorD arm. Conclusion CyBorD is an effective and safe induction regimen for first-line therapy in ASCT eligible multiple myeloma patients. It produces less neuropathy and has an easier schedule to administer. It is now our standard protocol for these patients but dexamethasone has been reduced to once weekly for every cycle since then. NB: CyBorD (Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 PO days 1,8,15,22; Bortezomib 1,5 mg/m 2 SC days 1,8,15,22, Dexamethasone 20 mg PO bid days 1-4, 9-12, 17-20 for cycles 1-2, 20 mg PO bid once weekly for cycles 3-4.) Disclosures: Duquette: Janssen: Consultancy, Honoraria. Off Label Use: CyborD is a widely accepted regimen but has not been accepted by the FDA."
