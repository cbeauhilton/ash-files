    "abstract_text": "Background Minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity is a strong predictor for outcome in multiple myeloma. Next generation sequencing (NGS) for immunoglobulin heavy chain and kappa light chain VDJ rearrangements has become increasingly more common for MRD assessment. One of the known challenges with NGS for VDJ rearrangements is the vast diversity of sequences that are present, resulting in a need for a multiplex approach as common primers cannot be used to amplify all rearrangements. Also, somatic hypermutation may affect the annealing of primers and decrease the capture rate. The NGS VDJ assay developed by Adaptive Biotechnologies targets all theoretical combinations of VDJ sequences and has been used in several recent large randomized trials in multiple myeloma. The reported ~80% capture rate of the first version of the Sequenta/Adaptive 1.3 assay limited the ability to track MRD status post therapy. The assay has recently been updated and validated to increase resilience to somatic hypermutation. As there is no published reference data using this assay, we were motivated to assess VDJ capture in the clinical setting. Methods In total, 147 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM, n=101) or relapse/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM, n=46) seen at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center were identified and included in the study. At bone marrow collection, patient samples were sorted for mononuclear cells and a subset of samples were sorted for CD138+ plasma cells. Stored bone marrow samples from these patients underwent DNA extraction and were sequenced with the Adaptive NGS VDJ assay. The same samples were also sequenced for genomic events using our internal NGS panel myTYPE. myTYPE is a custom capture panel targeting the most frequent multiple myeloma associated-somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and IGH translocations. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of detection success in relation to clinical parameters such as age, gender, percent bone marrow plasma cells, as well as immunoglobulin heavy and light chain types, and myTYPE positivity. Results There overall capture rate for a unique VDJ sequence was 80%, 75% in NDMM samples and 89% in RRMM samples, respectively. The VDJ capture rate in samples that were myTYPE positive, e.g. samples with at least one genomic aberration detected by myTYPE, was 94%. In univariate analysis, the ORs of detecting a clonal VDJ sequence was 1.8 (95% CI 1.3-2.5) and 1.5 (1.2-1.9) for every 10% increase in plasma cells on bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, respectively. For every 1g/dL increase in M-spike, the OR of VDJ capture was 1.6 (1.2-2.2). Samples with at least one genomic aberration detected by myTYPE had a significantly higher detection rate of VDJ sequence, the OR of VDJ capture in myTYPE positive samples was 8.8 (3.2-31.3). Conversely, age, gender, type of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgG or IgA), or light chain type (kappa or lambda) had no significant effect on the VDJ detection rate (Table). In multivariate analysis, myTYPE positivity was found to be an independent predictor of VDJ capture, with an OR of 4.9 (1.6-18.4, p=0.009) for myTYPE positive samples. The ORs were 1.4 (1.1-2.2, p=0.052) for an increase in 10% plasma cells on bone marrow aspirate and 1.5 (0.97-2.3, p=0.083) every 1g/dL increase in M-spike. Conclusion The VDJ capture rate using the updated Adaptive NGS VDJ assay was 94% in multiple myeloma samples of high quality as indicated by myTYPE positivity. The capture success rate was higher in samples with a greater disease burden. As expected, the assay was less sensitive in samples with insufficient DNA content. Our results are supportive of the use of this NGS VDJ in multiple myeloma, but also illustrate the importance of optimal sample ascertainment and processing.
