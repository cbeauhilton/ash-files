    "abstract_text": "Introduction multiple myeloma (MM) is currently an incurable hematological malignancy. Discovering molecular therapeutic targets is a new approach to improve the outcome in the treatment of the malignant disease. As CD200 is a type \u2160membrane glycoprotein expressed on myeloma cells, we asked if the expression of CD200 could serve as a prognostic marker for MM patients. Our data indicated that the expression level of CD200 is indeed correlated with the prognosis of the MM patients. Methods bone marrow samples from 96 newly diagnosed MM patients from April 2011 to July 2013 were evaluated by flow cytometry, using PE-conjugated anti-CD200 mAb, FITC-conjugated anti-CD138 mAb, and PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD45 mAb. PE-or FITC-conjugated normal mouse IgG was used as isotype-matched controls. Results 96 MM patients were investigated in the present study, including 60 men and 36 women, with a median age of 63 years (range 34\u201386 years). 81/96(84%) MM patients were CD200 positive with a median Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of 127 as analyzed by flow cytometry, which was consistent with the previous studies. While in 15 of 96 patients, CD200 expression was undetectable. Among the CD200 positive ones 7.40% patients were classified as stage \u2160, 12.35% were stage \u2161, and 80.25% were stage \u2162 according to Durie\u2013Salmon staging criteria. 40.74% patients were stage\u2160, 22.22% were stage \u2161, and 37.04% were stage \u2162, according to the International Staging System (ISS). Analysis of the CD200 positive patients revealed the MFI<127 group had a better progression free survival (PFS) (p=0.046) ( Fig 1A ) and overall survival (OS) (p=0.069) compared to those with MFI\u2265127. In the patients with age \u226565 years old, PFS (p=0.023) ( Fig 1B ) and OS (p=0.044) ( Fig 1C ) were much shorter in the MFI\u2265127 group, compared to the MFI<127 ones.

The better PFS and OS were observed in the MFI<127 group compared to the patients with MFI\u2265127, especially in the patients with age\u226565 years old. Improved PFS in CD200 positive ones is likely due to the immune suppression mediated by CD200. Our study suggests that targeting therapy against CD200 may become a new approach to the treatment of MM in clinical practice. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
