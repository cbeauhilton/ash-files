    "abstract_text": "Abstract\u25a1F Objective To analyze the complete remission (CR) rate, disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients induced with HAD (Homoharringtonine-HHT, cytosine arabinoside-AraC, daunorubicin-DNR) regimen containing intermediate dose AraC (ID-AraC) and to explore the impact of cytogenetic abnormalities on the prognosis. Methods 87 AML patients were treated with HAD regimen containing ID-AraC as induction therapy. HAD regimen was as follow: HHT 2mg/m 2 .d, Day 1\u20137; Ara-C 100mg/m 2 , Day 1\u20134, 1\u20131.5g/m 2 /q12h, Day 5\u20137; DNR 40 mg/m 2 .d, Day 1\u20133. CR rate, DFS and OS were calculated.83 patients who had karyotype results were divided into 3 groups according to SWOG criteria respectively. Differences in CR rate, DFS and OS among different groups were evaluated. Results The CR rate of the 87 cases was 80/87 (92%). Median DFS of the 80 CR patients was NR (not reach). DFS rates at 1 and 3 years were 76.3% and 63.4% respectively. The median OS of the 87 patients was 16 (range from 2 to 67) months. OS rates at 1 and 3 years were 86.0% and 58.7% respectively. According to SWOG criteria, CR rate, median DFS and OS were 100%, NR for the favorable group\u201edG88.9%, NR and 16 months for the intermediate group\u201edG83.3%, 4.5 months and 7.5 months for the adverse group. The differences among the three groups were statistically significant excepting for CR rate between adverse and intermediate groups. Conclusions HAD regimen containing ID-AraC as induction chemotherapy regimen is very effective in de novo AML of adult patients, can achieve higher CR rate and longer survival time than standard dose HAD regimen. Most of the patients were able to endure therapy. Cytogenetics is the important prognostic factor for AML patients. The differences among the three groups were statistically significant."
