    "abstract_text": "The cellular origin of multiple myeloma (MM) has not yet been identified. Based on immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) gene analysis, myeloma cells are derived from mature B cells. Chromosomal aberrations such as trisomy and chromosomal translocation (cTr) play a critical role in the early tumorigenesis of MM. We hypothesized that the abnormal cells from which myeloma cells originate might be mature B lymphocytes with chromosomal or genetic changes in the reprogrammed state that enable them to acquire the potential to become tumors in the process of redifferentiation into B lymphocytes. We established induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSs) from normal B lymphocytes (BiPSCs: BiPSC13 & MIB2-6); these BiPSCs have the same VDJ rearrangement of IgH as the original B lymphocytes and differentiate into CD34 + /CD38 - hematopoietic progenitor cells co-culture with stromal cells, AGM-S3 (Sci Rep, 2017). We then established a method to induce reciprocal cTr t(11;14), which is a reciprocal cTr between IgH and CCND1 and the most frequent cTr in MM, using the CRISPR/Cas9 system; cTr was induced by infection of IgH-CCND1 lentiCRISPRv2 lentivirus, which targets the human IgH E\u00b5 region and 13kb upstream of the CCND1 coding sequence, to BiPSCs (Oncol Lett, 2019). Subsequently, we established cell lines carrying reciprocal cTr t(11;14) between CCND1 and either an allele in which VDJ rearrangement of IgH had been completed or an allele in which VDJ rearrangement had not been completed (stopped at DJ joining) in BiPSC13 t(11;14) (AZ & AX) and MIB2-6 t(11;14) (BC & BG), respectively. These BiPSCs differentiated into CD34 + /CD38 - /CD45 +/- /CD43 +/- hematopoietic progenitors cells in co-culture with AGM-S3 or in stem cell differentiation medium; this was subsequently confirmed by the differentiation into granulocytes, macrophages, and erythroblasts in a colony-formation assay. We are now trying to produce BiPSCs in which cTr t(11;14) is induced when they differentiate into mature B cells expressing CD27. First, we used the Cre-loxP recombination system to induce cTr t(11;14) in BiPSCs. BiPSCs were transfected with IgH loxP-Neo-loxP knock-in vector and IgH lentiCRISPRv2 vector. Subsequently, G418-resistant BiPSCs carrying loxP-Neo-loxP in IgH were transfected with iCre-EGFP. After removing the loxP-Neo site from EGFP-positive cells, BiPSCs carrying IgH-loxP were transfected with CCND1 loxP-FRT3-Neo-FRT3 knock-in vector and CCND1 lentiCRISPRv2 vector. Subsequently, G418-resistant BiPSCs carrying IgH-loxP in IgH and loxP-FRT3-Neo-FRT3 in CCND1 were transfected with Flpo-EGFP. After removing the FRT3-Neo site from EGFP-positive cells, BiPSCs carrying IgH-loxP in IgH and CCND1-loxP-FRT3 in CCND1 were transfected with iCre-HygR. Hygromycin B-resistant cells were picked, the reciprocal cTr t(11;14) was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, and we established BiPSCs with der(11)t(11;14) and BiPSCs with der(14)t(11;14). We also developed a system in which Cre is expressed along with CD27 expression in the B cell lymphoma cell line Raji. These BiPSCs could be useful for the study of myeloma-initiating cells, but whether they would be able to be redifferentiated into B lymphocyte is important.
