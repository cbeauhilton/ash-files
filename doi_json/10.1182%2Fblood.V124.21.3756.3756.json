    "abstract_text": "Background: EphA3 is a novel drug target involved in cell positioning in fetal development. In adults it is an oncofetal antigen, that is re-expressed in hematologic malignancies (blood and bone marrow, leukemic stem cells) and solid tumors. It is also upregulated in diseases characterized by abnormal proliferation and fibrosis, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and diabetic kidney disease. KB004 is a Humaneered\u00ae high affinity antibody (KD = 610 pM) targeting EphA3 with at least 3 possible mechanisms of action: direct apoptosis in tumor cells, activation of ADCC and disruption of tumor vasculature. Objectives: The primary objectives of the Phase I study component are to determine safety and MTD for KB004 in patients with hematologic malignancies, refractory to or unfit for chemotherapy. Secondary objectives are to characterize PK, immunogenicity, and preliminary clinical activity of KB004. Exploratory objectives include evaluation of EphA3 expression on tumor, stromal, and endothelial cells. Methods: Multicenter Phase I/II study. Key eligibility criteria: unsuitable for standard of care or relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancy, ECOG PS 0-1, adequate organ function, platelets \u2265 10,000/uL (untransfused for 7 days) and normal coagulation times. KB004 was administered as a 1-2 hr intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle, at incremental doses of 20, 40, 70, 100, 140, 190, 250 and 330 mg. At 70 mg and above infusion reaction prophylaxis included H1 and H2 blockers, acetaminophen and IV steroids. Safety and activity by IWG response criteria were assessed. Peripheral blood and bone marrow biopsies for PK analysis and EphA3 expression were also collected. Results: A total of 50 patients (AML 39, MDS 7, DLBCL 1, MF 3) received KB004 in the phase I/dose finding component of the study, which has been completed. The most common toxicities were transient grade 1 and grade 2 transient infusion reactions (IRs) in 79% of patients. IRs were characterized by chills, elevated temperature, fever, rigors, back pain, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypertension and transient hypoxia (in 2 cases). No other significant KB004 related toxicity was observed. Two patients discontinued KB004 due to an IR. One of these (grade 3) defined a DLT at the 330mg dose level. A second patient at 330mg had grade 2 infusion reactions associated with multiple infusion delays. These observations prompted expansion of the next lowest dose cohort, 250mg. Six evaluable patients were treated at this dose level. No clinically significant IRs or DLTs were observed. This is therefore the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). At all dose levels observed Cmax for KB004 was approximately dose proportional. Sustained exposure above the predicted effective concentration (1ug/mL) to cover the 7-day interval between doses was achieved above 190mg. Responses according to IWG criteria were observed in patients with AML, MF and MDS at the 20 mg, 140g and 250mg dose levels, respectively. At 20mg, a 78 yr-old patient with relapsed AML achieved CRp. Remission was sustained for over 18 months and relapse was preceded by a rise in EphA3 expression. Serial bone marrow biopsies with KB004 treatment show decreased reticulin and collagen fibrosis. At 140mg, a 67 yr old patient with JAK2 V617F mutant previously untreated myelofibrosis whose predominant clinical problem at diagnosis was anemia achieved Clinical Improvement [CI]. Transfusion independency (both RBC and platelets) has been sustained for 8+ months with improvement in constitutional symptoms and improved splenomegaly. At 250 mg an 84 yr-old patient with MDS/MPN (intermediate risk) achieved a Hematologic Improvement [HI, erythroid]. A > 50% reduction in marrow blast percentage was seen in 8 patients. Bone marrow biopsies positive for EphA3 expression with a cut-off of 10% of nucleated cells were obtained in greater than 70% of AML patients. Of 20 patients for whom EphA3 expression data exists with time, 7 (35%) had at least a 50% reduction in expression with treatment. Conclusion: KB004 is a novel agent targeted against EphA3 that is well tolerated when given as a weekly 2 hour infusion. The promising clinical activity profile is postulated to be consistent with the antifibrotic mechanism. The Phase II component of the study is ongoing in which the activity of KB004 will be characterized in disease specific cohorts including AML, MDS and MF at the RP2D of 250mg.
