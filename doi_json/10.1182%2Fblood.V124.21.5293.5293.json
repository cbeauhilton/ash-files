    "abstract_text": "Background: Lintuzumab, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody, targets myeloid leukemia cells but has only modest activity in AML. To increase the antibody\u2019s potency yet avoid nonspecific cytotoxicity of \u03b2-emitting isotopes, 225 Ac (t \u00bd =10 d), a radiometal that yields 4 \u03b1-particles, was conjugated to lintuzumab. A phase I trial showed that 225 Ac-lintuzumab is safe at doses \u2264 3 \u00b5Ci/kg and has anti-leukemic activity across all dose levels studied (Jurcic et al. ASH, 2011). We are conducting a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxicity, and biological activity of fractionated-dose 225 Ac-lintuzumab in combination with LDAC. Patients and Methods: Patients \u2265 60 yrs who had untreated AML with poor prognostic factors, e.g. , an antecedent hematologic disorder, unfavorable cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities, and significant comorbidities, were eligible. Patients received LDAC 20 mg twice daily for 10 d every 4-6 wks for up to 12 cycles. During Cycle 1, beginning 4-7 days after completion of LDAC, two doses of 225 Ac-lintuzumab were given approximately one week apart. To prevent radiation-induced nephrotoxicity, patients were given furosemide while receiving 225 Ac-lintuzumab and spironolactone for one year afterward. Results: Nine patients (median age, 76 yrs; range, 73-81 yrs) were treated. Seven patients (78%) had a history of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), for which five (56%) received prior therapy with hypomethylating agents (n=4) or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (n=1). One patient (11%) had chronic myeloid leukemia in a molecularly undetectable state at the time of AML diagnosis. Six patients (67%) had intermediate-risk cytogenetics, and three (33%) had unfavorable cytogenetics. The median CD33 expression was 76% (range, 45-100%). Patients received 225 Ac-lintuzumab at doses of 0.5 (n=3) or 1 (n=6) \u03bcCi/kg/fraction. Total administered activity ranged from 68-199 \u03bcCi. The median number of cycles administered was 2 (range, 1-4). Dose-limiting toxicity was seen in one patient receiving 1 \u00b5Ci/kg/fraction who had grade 4 thrombocytopenia with bone marrow aplasia persisting > 6 wks after receiving 225 Ac-lintuzumab. Hematologic toxicities included grade 4 neutropenia (n=1) and thrombocytopenia (n=3). Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities included febrile neutropenia (n=6), pneumonia (n=2), bacteremia (n=1), cellulitis (n=1), transient increase in creatinine (n=1), hypokalemia (n=1), and generalized weakness (n=1). Bone marrow blast reductions were seen in 5 of 7 patients (71%) evaluated after Cycle 1. Mean blast reduction was 61% (range, 34-100%). Three of the 7 patients (43%) had marrow blast reductions of \u2265 50%; however, no remissions were observed. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.5 mos (range, 1.7-15.7+ mos). Median overall survival (OS) from study entry was 5.4 mos (range, 2.2-24 mos). For the 7 patients with prior MDS, median OS was 9.1 mos (range 2.3-24 mos). Conclusions: Fractionated-dose 225 Ac-linutuzmab in combination with LDAC is feasible, safe, and has anti-leukemic activity. Dose escalation continues to define the MTD, with planned doses up to 2 \u00b5Ci/kg/fraction. Additional patients will be treated at the MTD in the phase II portion of this trial to determine response rate, PFS, and OS. Disclosures Ravandi: Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Research Funding.
