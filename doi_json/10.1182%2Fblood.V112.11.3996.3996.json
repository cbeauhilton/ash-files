    "abstract_text": "Background: Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a disease which largely affects older adults, for whom optimal therapy is unclear. Evidence based strategies are lacking to identify those older adults who may tolerate and benefit from standard therapies. Objective: Test the feasibility of pre-treatment, inpatient geriatric assessment (GA) in older adults hospitalized with newly diagnosed AML. Methods: Prospective evaluation of consecutive patients \u226560 years of age with newly diagnosed AML and planned induction chemotherapy admitted to a single institution from 6/2007\u20136/2008. Bedside GA was performed within 72 hours of diagnosis. In addition to demographics and routine labs, the GA measures obtained by a trained nurse included Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Vulnerable Elders Survey-13 (VES-13), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB, includes timed 4 meter walk, chair stands, standing balance), and grip strength. Measures to assess feasibility included: recruitment; time to complete the assessment, and proportion completing entire GA battery. Results: Among 22 eligible inpatients, 11 enrolled (50%). The median age was 71 (range 63\u201378) and 72.7% were female. Poor risk cytogenetics were present in 27.3%. Laboratory measures included white blood cell count (mean=24.6\u00d710 3 /mm 3 , SD 26.2\u00d710 3 ), hemoglobin (mean=8.5 g/dl, SD 1.6), platelet count (mean=60.3\u00d710 3 /mm 3 , SD=38.4\u00d710 3 ), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (mean=340.0 U/L, SD=235.1), and albumin (mean=3.2 g/dl, SD=0.36). 66.6% of participants completed the entire GA battery; the remainder completed only self-report measures. Mean time for completion of the GA was 36.8 minutes (SD 9.8). Mean scores for survey measures included: MMSE=26.1 (range 21\u201330, SD 3.2), CCI=1.6 (range 0\u20134, SD 1.1), CES-D=22.9 (range 8\u201337, SD 11.0), VES-13 survey=5.0 (range 1\u20138, SD 2.5). A wide range of objective physical performance was demonstrated including mean SPPB total score=7.4 (range 5\u201310; SD 2.1), mean timed 4 meter walk=12.9 seconds (range 6.6\u201322.1; SD 5.1), and mean grip strength=29.3 (range 12\u201362; SD 16.8). Conclusions: Inpatient GA including physical performance assessment is feasible in older adults hospitalized for AML and our preliminary findings demonstrate significant variability in cognitive, emotional and physical status. These measures may represent valuable candidate predictors of outcomes, and ongoing studies will identify which measures are most predictive of treatment morbidity and response."
