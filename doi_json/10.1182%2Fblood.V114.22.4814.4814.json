    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4814 Background and Aims We synthesized two phospha sugar derivatives, 2,3,4-tribromo-3-methyl-1-phenylphospholane 1-oxide (TMPP) by reacting 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-phospholene 1-oxide with bromine, and we has reported their potential as an antileukemic agent in cell lines. In this study, we have investigated that TMPP have antileukemic effects as shown in various leukemia cell lines as well as primary AML patient specimens. Moreover, we have identified the target molecules of TMPP by using docking simulation. Methods In human leukemia cell lines (HL60, NB4, U937, NOMO-1, CEM, MOLT4, SUP-B15, and YRK2 cells), the anti-leukemic effects were elevated by cell proliferation assay, Cell cycle analysis, Western blotting. In AML cells derived from AML patients and normal hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from healthy volunteers, the changes of viability by treatment with TMPP were evaluated. By using docking simulation, the target molecules were identified in leukemia cells treated with TMPP. Results TMPP showed inhibitory effects on leukemia cell proliferation, with mean IC 50 values of 10.2 nmol/L for TMPP, indicating that inhibition appeared to be dependent on the number of bromine atoms in the structure. Further, TMPP at 8.4 nmol/L induced G2/M cell cycle block in leukemia cells, and TMPP at 17.3 nmol/L induced apoptosis in these cells. TMPP treatment reduced cell cycle progression signals (FoxM1, KIS, Cdc25B, Cyclin D1, Cyclin A, and Aurora-B) and tumor cell survival (Bcl-2, p27 Kip1 and p21 Cip1 ). Further, treatment with TMPP significantly reduced the viability of AML specimens derived from AML patients, but only slightly reduced the viability of normal ALDH hi progenitor cells. We also found that TMPP showed the strong activity against Aurora kinase B and Bcl-2 by using docking simulation. Conclusion We demonstrate that TMPP inhibits Aurora kinase B and Bcl-2 and shows a dominant Aurora B kinase inhibition-related cell cycle arrest and the induction of mitochondrial potential catastrophe-related apoptosis in acute leukemia cells. Moreover, we identified Aurora kinase B and Bcl-2 as the target molecules of TMPP. We conclude that TMPP has great therapeutic potential in anticancer therapy in a wide range of cancers.
