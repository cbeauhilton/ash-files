    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2335 The TAL1/SCL gene, originally discovered from its involvement by a recurrent chromosomal translocation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, is important for hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor function and is essential for hematopoietic and vascular development. A member of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors, TAL1 binds a DNA sequence motif, CANNTG, termed the E box. We and others recently identified a novel TAL1-containing DNA-binding complex that includes an ETS protein, ELF2 (also known as NERF) in erythroid cells, and recognizes a bipartite sequence element containing an adjacent ETS binding site and E box. Our work showed this complex also contains proteins common to other TAL1 DNA-binding complexes described, including a LIM domain protein, LMO2 in erythroid cells, the LIM domain binding protein Ldb1, and putative single-stranded DNA-binding proteins SSBP2 and SSBP3. As both ELF2 and histone demethylase JARID1A, and later the related JARID1B, were identified using the same methodology (yeast two-hybrid analysis) to interact with LMO2, and multiple peptides derived from Jarid1b were identified by mass spectrometry analysis of highly purified Tal1-containing complexes from murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, we investigated whether JARID1B was present in the TAL1- and ELF2-containing complex. First, co-immunoprecipitation analysis identified Jarid1b in Tal1- or Elf2-containing immune precipitates and Tal1 in Jarid1b-containing immune precipitates from MEL cell extracts. Further, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and re-ChIP analysis showed that Elf2 and Jarid1b co-occupied a region in the fourth intron of the Ssbp3 gene in MEL cells, previously demonstrated to be a physiologic target of the Tal1/Elf2 complex. Finally, knockdown of Elf2 and Jarid1b in MEL cells produced the same phenotype, decreased cellular proliferation. These results suggest a role for the JARID type histone demethylase JARID1B, and by inference histone demethylation, in the function of the ETS-E box DNA-binding complex and in proliferation of late-stage murine erythroid progenitors.
