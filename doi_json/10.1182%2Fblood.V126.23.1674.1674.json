    "abstract_text": "Background: CMML is a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with distinct morphological and genetic features. Based on differences in blast count CMML is divided into CMML-1 (90% of patients harbor at least one molecular mutation. The most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities include abnormalities of chromosome 7, trisomy 8 and complex karyotype. The genes most frequently mutated in CMML are TET2 , ASXL1 and SRSF2 . Aims: 1. Evaluate the frequency of submicroscopic gains and losses of chromosomal material as well as copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) in CMML with normal karyotype in chromosome banding analysis (CBA). 2. Analyze the association of these lesions with molecular mutations and impact on survival. Patients and Methods: 69 patients with CMML-1 and 31 with CMML-2 and normal karyotype by CBA were evaluated by array CGH (SurePrint G3 ISCA CGH+SNP, Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). 32 patients were female, 68 male, median age was 75 years (range: 50-89 years). These were compared to 41 cases with aberrant karyotype by CBA. Patients were screened for mutations (mut) in ASXL1 , CBL , DNMT3A , EZH2 , JAK2 V617F, KITD 816, KRAS , NRAS , RUNX1 , SETBP1 , SF3B1 , SRSF2 , TET2 , and U2AF1 . Results: In 35 cases (35%) with normal karyotype by CBA 46 abnormalities were detected by array CGH (CGHpos). These were 6 gains, 17 losses and 23 CN-LOH. No recurrent gain was observed, while recurrent losses of 4q24 (n=2, including TET2 ) and of 13q14 (n=2) were identified. CN-LOH was recurrently observed on 4q (n=6, including TET2 ), 11q (n=5, including CBL ), 17q (n=4) and 7q (n=2). Mutations were identified at the following frequencies: TET2 : 77% (74/96), SRSF2 : 56% (54/97), ASXL1 : 48% (46/96), RUNX1 : 20% (20/98), CBL : 15% (15/97), KRAS : 12% (12/97), JAK2 V617F: 10% (10/98). The following genes were mutated in <10%: NRAS , SETBP1 , EZH2 , U2AF1 , KIT D816, SF3B1 , DNMT3A . 85 patients were analysed for all mutations. In median 3 mutations were identified per patient (range 0-6), while only in 1 patient no mutation was detected. 4/5 (80%) cases with 11q CN-LOH harbored a CBL mut and 7/8 (88%) cases with CN-LOH 4q or 4q24 deletion harbored a TET2 mut, indicating that these two gene mutations might contribute in homozygous manner to pathogenesis. NRAS mut were significantly less frequent in CMML CGHpos compared to CGHneg (0% vs 14.3%, p=0.024). Mutations in ASXL1 and RUNX1 frequently occurred together: 35% of ASXL1 mut cases also carried a RUNX1 mut as compared to 8% of ASXL1 wild-type cases (p=0.002). All 7 SETBP1 mut cases also carried an ASXL1 mut (p=0.04) Patients with CGHneg (n=65) and CGHpos (n=35) were compared to 41 cases with aberrant karyotype by CBA. While TET2 mut were detected at comparable frequencies in CGHneg and CGHpos patients (80% and 71%) they were significantly less frequent in CMML with aberrant karyotype (54%, p=0.021). On the other hand SETBP1 mut were more frequent in CMML with aberrant karyotype as compared to CGHpos and CGHneg (21%, 7%, 9%, p=0.08). A distinct mutation profile was identified in 9 patients with monosomy 7 who showed ASXL1 mut in 78%, SETBP1 mut in 75%, CBL mut in 33% and TET2 mut in only 22%. In CMML-2 RUNX1 mut were more frequent than in CMML-1 (33% vs 12%. p=0.008). No differences in overall survival (OS) were observed between patients with CGHneg, CGHpos and aberrant karyotype. However, Cox regression analyses revealed a negative impact on OS for ASXL1 mut (relative risk (RR): 2.4, p=0.027), RUNX 1mut (RR: 2.5, p=0.025) and CMML-2 (RR: 2.2, p=0.02). Conclusions: 1. 35% of CMML cases with normal karyotype based on chromosome banding analysis harbor abnormalities detectable by array CGH. 2. Prognosis in CMML is determined by the molecular mutation profile, cytogenetic abnormalities play a minor role. 3. Mutations in ASXL1 and RUNX1 are associated with a negative impact on survival. 4. The poor prognosis described for monosomy 7 seems to be due to a high frequency of ASXL1 und SETBP1 mutations. 5. Inferior outcome in CMML-2 might be due to a higher frequency of RUNX1 mutations. 6. In CMML a molecular work up including screening for mutations in ASXL1 and RUNX1 provides more relevant prognostic information than chromosome banding analysis and/or array CGH.
