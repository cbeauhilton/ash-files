    "abstract_text": "Objectives : Tisagenlecleucel (CTL019) is a chimeric antigen receptor T cell- therapy that reprograms autologous T cells to target CD19+ leukemia cells, approved in the US (2017) and in the EU (2018). This study reports the feasibility, safety and efficacy of CTL019 in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) treated in Robert-Debr\u00e9 and Saint-Louis University Hospitals (Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris/Universit\u00e9 de Paris). Methods : Patients (pts) with an apheresis performed between march 1, 2016 and june 15, 2019, included in sponsored-clinical trials or treated within the French compassionate program or with the commercial product, were analyzed. All infused pts received a fludarabine-cyclophosphamide based lymphodepletion before a single infusion of CAR-T cells (2 to 5 x 10 6 CTL019/kg if less than 50 kg; a fixed dose of 1 to 2.5 x 10 8 CTL019/kg if > 50 kg) Results : 55 pts were referred from 25 French centers. Forty-one pts with a median number of relapses of 2 (range, 1-5) were infused with CTL019 at a median age of 18.2 y (range, 1-29.2). Eight pts were not infused due to progressive disease (n=4), screen failure (n=3) or fatal septic shock (n=1). Six pts were waiting to be infused at time of analysis. Out of the 41 infused pts, 26 had a prior history of allogeneic SCT (63%), 11 had received blinatumomab (27%). Among the 40 pts evaluable at one month post-infusion, 38 were in CR/CRi (95%) (one progression at day 5 after infusion and one toxic death at D6), 35/38 (92.1%) being clone-specific Ig-TCR MRD negative. After 3 months 21 out of 26 evaluable pts (81%) had a negative MRD. The 5 remaining MRD positive pts did relapse. No pt underwent allogeneic HSCT while in CR after CTL019 infusion. Median event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were not reached with a median follow up of 7.2 months (range, 0.2-36.3). The 18-month OS probability was 80% (95%CI, 58%-92%). The 18-month EFS probability was 58 % (95%CI, 37%-74%). Ten pts relapsed after a median time of 3.4 months (range, 1.9-10): 3 relapses were CD19+ and 5 CD19- (4 out of these 5 pts had a preexposure to blinatumomab), 2 being of undetermined status. Loss of B-cell aplasia (BCA) occurred in 9 pts after a median time of 3 months (range, 2-12), followed by relapse for 2 pts (one concomitant with loss of BCA and one 7 months later). Three pts received a second infusion of CTL019 for loss of BCA with no further expansion of CAR-T cells. Prior treatment with blinatumomab was a significant predictive factor for relapse (HR=6.082, 95%CI, 1.2-30, p=0.0005) in a univariate analysis. There was a trend toward increased risk of relapse with increased disease burden (\u2265 5%) before lymphodepletion regimen (HR=2.4, 95%CI, 0.7-8, p=0.14). Twenty-two pts experienced a CRS (\u2265 grade 3: n=13, all \u2265 10 y). ICU was required for 14 pts (34%). One 29 year-old pt died of an uncontrollable CRS at day 6. Ten pts received tocilizumab, 4 pts siltuximab and 9 pts corticosteroids. Age \u2265 10 y (p=0.04) and a high disease burden just before lymphodepletion (marrow blasts \u2265 5%) (p=0.01) were associated with a higher risk of CRS \u2265 grade 3. Nine neurological events have been reported, being reversible except in 2 cases (one death in combination with grade 5 CRS-cf supra-, one HHV6-related encephalitis with neurological sequelae). Among the 9 pts who presented neurological events, 8 experienced CRS grade \u2265 3 (RR=17.2, 95%CI, 3.22-100.3, p=0.0001). By day 28, unresolved neutropenia grade \u2265 3 was reported for 13 pts. G-CSF treatment was required in 21 pts overall. Thrombocytopenia grade \u22653 was reported for 14 pts. Conclusion : CTL019 confirms its efficacy with a high response rate after infusion and very encouraging early outcomes in a cohort of pts heavily pretreated for refractory or multiply relapsed B-ALL. Persistent remissions with a potential for cure were observed without additional HSCT, relapses occurring within the first year after infusion of CTL019. Accurate assessment of a potentially deleterious effect of Blinatumomab preexposure notable on CD19 negative relapse will need more pts and a longer follow-up. Toxicity profile was tolerable and manageable thanks to collaboration between intensivists, neurologists and hematologists. The identification of severe CRS predictive risk factors (high disease burden just before lymphodepletion and age \u2265 10 y) points towards the reinforcement of toxicity monitoring and treatment anticipation in these cases.
