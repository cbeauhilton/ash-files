    "abstract_text": "Background: Sickle cell disease affects 100,000 people in the United States. Cancer does not appear to be more common in individuals with sickle cell disease however many presenting signs and symptoms of cancer overlap with signs and symptoms of sickle cell disease, complicating diagnosis. Furthermore, sickle cell disease can complicate surgical, chemo- and radio- therapies for malignancy. Methods: We reviewed the past 46 years experience of cancers in children with sickle cell at a large urban pediatric referral center. We identified 5 cases and reviewed the presentations, treatments, response to therapy, sickle cell complication and laboratory values, including transfusion needs and effect of chemotherapy on fetal hemoglobin levels. Results: We identified five cases of malignancies in children with sickle cell disease including cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkin's lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Wilms tumor and renal cell carcinoma. An additional patient with sickle cell trait was diagnosed with metastatic renal medullary carcinoma. The patients were ages 6-18 years old at diagnosis and 4 were female. All had delays in diagnosis as their initial signs and symptoms overlapped with sickle cell disease (abdominal mass mimicking splenomegaly, low blood counts, fever and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, hematuria). All five achieved complete remission with multi-modality therapy (excluding stem cell transplants) and are currently doing well 1- 20 years after treatment. Admissions for pain were reduced during and for some period after cancer therapy and 2 patients had marked, and in one case, prolonged elevation of fetal hemoglobin after therapy. Discussion: Children with sickle cell develop cancers that can be confused for sickle cell related complications. Cancer therapy can be well tolerated and successful in children with sickle cell. Sickle cell complications are decreased during cancer therapy likely secondary to frequent therapy related transfusion and therapy induced increases in fetal hemoglobin.
