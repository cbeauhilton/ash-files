    "abstract_text": "Rebound like recurrent thrombotic events are concerns about anticoagulant therapies. Withdrawal of heparins and a direct thrombin inhibitor is reported to be associated with evidence of rebound coagulation phenomenon in patients with coronary artery diseases ( Ref 1 ). Previously we have shown that low-dose administration of a direct thrombin inhibitor, melagatran, enhances coagulation induced by tissue factor (TF) in rats ( Ref 2 ). Objectives: To determine whether anticoagulants enhance thrombin generation in human plasma, and whether the negative-feedback system [thrombin-thrombomodulin (TM)-protein C] contributes to the enhancement. Methods: Thrombin generation in pooled human plasma was assayed by means of the calibrated automated thrombography (CAT) with the thrombinoscope software in vitro. Thrombin generation was induced by 2.5 pM tissue factor (TF) and 4 \u03bcM phospholipids. The effects of following anticoagulants were assessed: antithrombin (AT)-independent thrombin inhibitors [melagatran, recombinant hirudin (lepirudin), and active site blocked thrombin (IIai)], AT-dependent anticoagulants (heparin, dalteparin, and fondaparinux), and AT-independent FXa inhibitors (DU-176b and DX-9065a). Results: Melagatran, lepirudin, and IIai increased peak levels of thrombin generation in the presence of 8 nM recombinant human soluble TM. The effects reached maximal at 200 nM of melagatran (2.3-fold), 8.95 nM of lepirudin (1.6-fold), and 405 nM of IIai (2.2-fold). At higher concentrations, melagatran and lepirudin turned to suppress thrombin generation. Heparin, dalteparin, fondaparinux, DU-176b, and DX-9065a did not enhance thrombin generation, just exerted inhibitory effects. In the absence of TM, the enhancement by melagatran of peak thrombin generation was only 1.2-fold, suggesting the significant role of the negative-feedback system in this aggravation of thrombin generation. Since thrombin acts both the pro- and anti-coagulant, the inhibition of the negative-feedback system by these thrombin inhibitors may cause enhancement of thrombin generation. To test this hypothesis, we examined thrombin generation in protein C-deficient plasma. AT-independent thrombin inhibitors failed to enhance thrombin generation in protein C-deficient plasma. Conclusions: These results indicate that AT-independent thrombin inhibitors at low concentrations enhance thrombin generation probably due to suppression of the negative feedback system by inhibiting protein C activation. This in vitro aggravation of thrombin generation may be a possible explanation of hypercoagulation by melagatran in a rat model of TF-induced intravascular coagulation. Furthermore this phenomenon would contribute to clinical rebound like recurrent thrombotic events associated with anticoagulant therapies with these inhibitors. In contrast, AT-independent FXa inhibitors like DU-176b are less prone to induce the rebound because of lack of increase in thrombin generation.",
