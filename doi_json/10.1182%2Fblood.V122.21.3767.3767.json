    "abstract_text": "Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in hypoxic niches in the bone marrow (BM) and sustain long-life haematopoiesis. HSCs are largely quiescent, self-renew, undergo apoptosis and generate progenitor cells, which differentiate to multiple blood lineages. The strict regulation of the balance between these fate decisions is essential for haematopoiesis and their dysregulation in HSCs and progenitor cells can result in leukaemic transformation. HSCs and leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are suggested to share the same niche and are in need to adapt to hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia-inducible-factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) is a key mediator of cellular responses to hypoxia and is important for the maintenance of HSC functions under stressful conditions. Furthermore, in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) HIF-1\u03b1 is essential for LSC maintenance and ablation or knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 leads to exhaustion of established LSCs. The aim of this study was to investigate the requirement for HIF-1\u03b1 in the generation of pre-LSCs and the establishment of LSCs. To investigate the role of HIF-1\u03b1 in the generation of pre-LSCs we retrovirally transduced haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from either WT or HIF1-\u03b1 fl/fl Vav-iCre with MLL-ENL retroviruses. Next we performed serial re-plating assays under normoxic and hypoxic conditions to generate pre-LSCs. Surprisingly, WT and HIF-1\u03b1 deficient HSPCs generated comparable numbers of colonies in normoxia and hypoxia ( Fig. 1a ). In addition no significant difference was found in the immunophenotypic profile of colonies ( Figure 1b ). Furthermore, microscopic examination indicated that colonies of all genotypes were dense consistent with their transformed shape ( Fig. 1c ).

These results indicate that HIF-1\u03b1 is dispensable for the generation of pre-LSCs. View large Download slide View large Download slide To test the role of HIF-1\u03b1 in establishment of LSCs from pre-LSCs we transplanted pre-LSCs into lethally irradiated mice together with support BM and monitored the mice for disease development. No significant difference was found in disease latency ( Fig. 3a ) or frequency of LSCs in peripheral blood, bone marrow or spleens ( Fig. 3b ) indicating that pre-LSCs lacking HIF-1\u03b1 can efficiently generate LSCs that cause aggressive AML. View large Download slide View large Download slide In conclusion, we provide genetic evidence that HIF-1\u03b1 is dispensable for the generation of pre-LSCs and the establishment of LSCs from pre-LSCs. These surprising findings, together with published results indicating that HIF-1\u03b1 is essential for maintenance of LSCs, imply that HIF-1\u03b1 has different roles at different stages of leukaemic transformation. Further studies are required to explain the distinct roles of HIF-1\u03b1 in different stages of leukaemogenesis. Disclosures: Ratcliffe: RedOx: Founder Other.
