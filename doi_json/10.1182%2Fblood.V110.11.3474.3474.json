    "abstract_text": "Arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 ) is a drug used world-wide that selectively causes the death of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells by novel mechanisms and induces complete clinical remission in 90% of patients without significant toxicity. The outstanding success of As 2 O 3 therapy in relapsed APL patients has not been replicated by an equivalent success in other types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We have studied As 2 O 3 mechanism(s) of action and identified agents to use in combination to improve the use of As 2 O 3 as a treatment for other types of AML. As 2 O 3 produces higher levels of H 2 O 2 and apoptosis in APL NB4 cells than in other AML cells at therapeutic concentrations of 1-2 uM. As 2 O 3 does not induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells but is synergistic with ascorbic acid (AA) or epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Both AA and EGCG produce H 2 O 2 which is augmented by the addition of As 2 O 3 . Apoptosis induction by As 2 O 3 in combination with AA or EGCG is inhibited by catalase and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a major neutrophil enzyme, augments H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis by converting it into more potent reactive oxygen species. HL-60, NB4, SKNO-1 and PLB985 cells which express high level of MPO, but not U937 and K562 cells without expression of MPO, are responsive to As 2 O 3 plus AA or EGCG-induced apoptosis. HP-100 cells, a subclone of HL-60 cells without MPO expression, are resistant to both combination treatments. MPO stable transfection sensitizes K562 cells to apoptosis following treatment with As 2 O 3 and AA or EGCG. NADPH oxidase is an enzyme complex which generates O 2 \u2212 and H 2 O 2 in neutrophils. In APL NB4 cells, As 2 O 3 induces expression of NADPH oxidase members and is thought to participate in H 2 O 2 production required for As 2 O 3 response. X-CGD cells, a subclone of PLB-985 with targeted disruption of the gp91 phox gene ( Zhen et al, PNAS  90 : 9832 , 1993 ) and loss of NADPH oxidase activity but with high levels of MPO activity, are responsive to treatment with As 2 O 3 and AA or EGCG. These results suggest that AA and EGCG enhance As 2 O 3 -induced apoptosis through a synergistic production of H 2 O 2 which is independent NADPH oxidase activation in non-APL AML cells. MPO augments the apoptotic effect of H 2 O 2 produced by As 2 O 3 plus AA or EGCG and it could be used as a marker to predict the sensitivity of AML cells to both combination treatments."
