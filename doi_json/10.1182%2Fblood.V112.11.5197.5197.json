    "abstract_text": "We conducted a retrospective single institution analysis to evaluate the immediate and long-term efficacy, tolerance, survival and time to progression of MM patients (pts) who received VELCADE (Vel.) as induction and in those who relapsed or were refractory after standard therapies. A total of 92 pts were included, 62 (67%) males and 30 (33%) females. Median age at treatment was 60 years [35\u201379]. At diagnosis, there were 48 (52%) IgG, 24 (26%) IgA, 2 (2%) IgD, 15 (16%) light chains and 3 (4%) plasma cell leukaemias, 11pts (12%) were in stage I A, 12 (13%) stage IIA and 69 (75%) stage III (51 A and 18B). The median level of \u03b22 microglobulin was 3.28 mg/l (1.12\u201324). Among 42 evaluated del(13), 19 (45%) were + in which there was two t(4;14)+. We defined 3 groups: group1:16 (17%) pts who received Vel. as induction, group2:58 (63%) pts who received Vel. as 2 nd line n=41 or 3 rd line n=17, group 3:18 (12%) pts who received Vel. as \u2265 4 th line. Prior to Vel.(groups 2 and 3), 53 (70%) pts had received an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 13 (14%) allogeneic HSCT and 35 (46%) thalidomide (Thal.) (median dose of 200mg/day, median duration of 4 months). The median interval between diagnosis and Vel. initiation was 28.3 months (0.2\u2013125); 28 pts had an interval less than 12 months (16 in 1 st line), 27 pts between 12 and 36 months and 37 pts with more than 36 months. The median number of Vel. cycles in group 1, 2 and 3 were 4[2\u20139], 5[2\u201312] and 5[3\u201312] respectively with a standard dose of 1.3 mg/m 2 decreased to 1.0 mg/m 2 in case of toxicity (8: n=8). Fifty-two (57%) pts received an association of dexamethasone (40mg/day). There were 6 Vel. discontinuation (<3 Vel.cycles) and 25 (27%) dose reduction due to neuropathy [3cycles n=2 (17%), 4\u20136 cycles n=12 (23%), 7\u20138 cycles, n=7 (50%) and \u22659 n=4 (50%)]. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 61 pts (66%) [32 (52%)gr1, 18 (30%)gr2, 9 (15%)gr3 and 4 (3%)gr4], in which, 25 (41%) had previously received Thal. [12 (48%)gr1, 8 (32%)gr2, 5 (20%)gr3]. The most other common toxicities were, fatigue n=35 (38%), constipation n=18(20%), diarrhea n= 11(12%), nausea n=14(15%) and vomiting n=7(8%). The overall response rate was observed in 67 (73%) pts [13 (14%)CR, 22 (24%)VGPR and 32 (35%)PR]. With a median follow-up of 23.4 months, the median overall survival (OS) for the whole population and for group 1 and 2 was not reached, and was 17 months for group 3. The probability of OS at 3 years for the whole population was 61%[50\u201373.5] (Figure 1) and were: 80%[62\u2013100], 66%[54\u201381] and 45%[25\u201382.5] for groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively (Figure 2). The probability of OS at 5 years for the whole population from MM diagnosis was 72.5%[63\u201384]. The median time to progression (TTP) was 25.5 months for the whole population; it was not reached for group 1, were 25.5 and 13 months for group 2 and 3 respectively. The probability of progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years was 51%[40\u201364,5] for the whole population and 66%[45\u201396], 52%[39\u201370] and 29%[12\u201371] for group 1, 2 and 3 respectively. We showed no significant difference in term of OS (p=0,166) and PFS (p=0.495) between the patients with del(13) [51% (31\u201383) and 42(23\u201378)] and without del(13) [83%(68,5\u201399,6) and 58%(40\u201385,5)]. Finally we observed a better PFS at 2 years for pts receiving lenalidomide after Vel. versus those who did not, 64%[42\u201396] and 48%[36\u201363] respectively. The multivariate analysis (studying: age, sex, stage, beta2M, del(13), previous lines, allogeneic HSCT, Thal., and interval diag-Vel.) showed only a significant impact of thalidomide HR=3.06 (1.37\u20136.85) (p=0,006), and a trend for interval diag-Vel. In conclusion, this analysis showed a very good percentage of long-term OS with a median not reached for Vel. nai\u0308ve or 2 nd , 3 rd Vel line MM pts. Moreover, we showed a significant negative impact of previous Thal. treatment and no impact of del(13). Figure 1. View large Download slide Probability of OS for the whole population Figure 1.
