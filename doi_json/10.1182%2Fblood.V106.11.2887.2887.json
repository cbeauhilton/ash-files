In this study, we investigated the effects of physiological growth factors on cell survival and DNA damage response in Imatinib treated Bcr-Abl positive and Bcr-Abl negative cells from murine and human origin. To this end, we used 32D and 32D/bcr-abl, BaF3 and BaF3/bcr-abl, and M07 and M07bcr-abl cell lines. All bcr-abl positive cell lines were highly sensitive to Imatinib in the absence of growth factors. mIL3 protected Bcr-Abl transformed murine cell lines from Imatinib-induced cell death but was not capable to restore the Imatinib-dependent blockade of the p53 response to cisplatinum or gamma irradiation in Bcr-Abl positive cells. Despite prolonged pre-incubation with mIL3, Imatinib led to a transient inhibition of PI3K-, MAPK-, and STAT5-pathways selectively in Bcr-Abl positive murine cells. Importantly, this transient blockade of survival pathways by Imatinib was completely abolished after simultaneous siRNA-mediated suppression of Bcr-Abl synthesis. In contrast to the murine cell lines, Bcr-Abl positive human megakaryocytic M07 cells can not be rescued from Imatinib-induced cell death. Imatinib treated cells died even when pre-incubated simultaneously with a growth factor mix consisting of hGM-CSF, hSCF, and hIL3. Suppression of Bcr-Abl synthesis by RNAi using a breakpoint-specific siRNA selectively inhibited Bcr-Abl-dependent growth of M07/bcr-abl cells to an extent comparable to that observed with Imatinib. Importantly, growth factor stimulation enabled survival of M07/bcr-abl cells after suppression of Bcr-Abl synthesis by siRNA but not after Imatinib-mediated inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase activity. In summary, our results indicate a dominant negative effect of kinase-inactive Bcr-Abl both on survival and on DNA damage response pathways.",
