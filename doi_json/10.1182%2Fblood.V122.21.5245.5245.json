Splenomegaly was noted in 29 cases (32.22%) of cases and hepatomegaly in 13 cases (14.44%). Associated conditions included hypertension in 24 cases (26.67%), gastrointestinal symptoms in 16 cases(17.78%) Diabetes mellitus in 15 cases (16.67%),Hepatitis C virus infection in 6 cases ( 6.67%), Hepatitis B in 2 cases ( 2.26%), coronory heart disease in 5 cases (5 .56%) and renal problems in 3 cases ( 3.33%).

Familial MPN, Cancer prostate, intestinal Schistosomiasis \u00a0\u00a0and post-liver transplant done post- hepatitis C virus cirrhosis were reported in one case each. Twenty two cases(24.44%) were controlled on Hydroxyuria only,16 cases 17.78%) on venesection plus hydroxyuria,16 cases(17.78%) on venesection only. Progression \u00a0was noted in 13 cases (14.44%) with marrow fibrosis in five cases (5.56%) and 14 cases (15.56%) were lost to follow-up. Mortality was seen in 10% (nine cases). Conclusion PV among Egyptians may have distinct presentations regarding incidence, age and \u00a0presentation.Simpler methods of symptom severity assessments may be more suitable for Egyptian patients.
