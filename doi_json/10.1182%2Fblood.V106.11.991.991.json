    "abstract_text": "B-lymphocyte stimulator protein (BLYS) and a proliferation inducing ligand (APRIL) are members of the tumor necrosis family of ligands which play an important role in normal and malignant human B-cell homeostasis through their receptors BCMA, TACI (for BLYS and APRIL) and BAFF-R (for BLYS only). We previously demonstrated via multicolor flow cytometric and RT-PCR analysis the expression of BLYS and APRIL, along with BCMA, TACI and BAFF-R on lymphoplasmacytic cells (LPC) as well as mast cells, which provide LPC growth support in patients with Waldenstrom\u2019s Macroglobulinemia (WM) (Blood 104:917a). Based on these studies, we performed sequence analysis for BLYS, APRIL, BCMA, TACI and BAFF-R from DNA obtained from CD19 + selected bone marrow LPC from 15 patients with the consensus panel diagnosis of WM, who also demonstrated active disease. These studies demonstrated multiple variants in exons 3 and 5 of TACI in 5/15 patients, and exon 1 of BAFF-R in 2/15 patients. The finding of genetic variants in the TACI gene in WM patients is of particular interest given its recently described role as a potential tumor suppressor gene, and potential involvement in the generation of autoimmunity ( Immunity  2003 ; 8 : 279 \u201388 ), which is a common complication in patients with WM. Moreover, variants in TACI have been reported in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) ( Nat Genet  2005 ; 37 : 820 \u20138 ), a finding significant to patients with WM who chronically demonstrate IgA and IgG hypogammaglobulinemia, even following successful therapeutic intervention as we recently reported (Blood 104:306b). The results of these studies suggest that variants in TACI, and possibly BAFF-R may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of WM."
