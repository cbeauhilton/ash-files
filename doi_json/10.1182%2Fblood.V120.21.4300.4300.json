There are approximately 2400 new cases per year in the US; approximately 80% of these will be Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) negative. Despite remarkable success in treatment of childhood and adolescent ALL, adult ALL patients are underserved by existing treatment options as reflected by the poor survival rates and extremely poor outcomes in the relapsed setting. Complete response (CR) rates in the front-line setting range from 90% in patients 60 years old and 3-year disease free survival ranges from 47% to 12% respectively. The unmet medical need in adult ALL is most pronounced in those age 60 and older. VSLI was recently granted accelerated FDA approval as a single-agent for the treatment of adults with advanced, relapsed and refractory Ph-negative ALL and has successfully completed a Phase 2 trial as a component of multi-agent therapy. Trial Design: HALLMARQ ( NCT01439347 ) is a Phase 3, multi-national, randomized study to evaluate the substitution of VSLI for standard vincristine (VCR) in the induction, consolidation, and maintenance phases of combination chemotherapy in the treatment of patients \u2265 60 years old with newly diagnosed Ph-negative ALL. The chemotherapy \u201cbackbone\u201d utilized in this trial is modified from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 8811 protocol. Asparaginase product usage is optional. The total duration of protocol-specified therapy is up to 24 months. VCR is dosed at 1.4 mg/m 2 with a per dose cap at 2 mg. VSLI is dosed at 2.25 mg/m 2 without a dose cap. A protocol-specified dose reduction algorithm applicable to both VSLI and VCR will be used to minimize Grade 3 neurotoxicity while also facilitating continued dosing. Growth factors (e.g., granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) and bowel regimens (e.g., daily stool softener) are recommended and will be prescribed according to investigator preference and institutional guidelines. The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS) and the study is powered for superiority. Secondary endpoints include remission rate, overall response rate, event-free survival, and safety and tolerability. Minimal residual disease (MRD) at multiple time points and pharmacokinetic parameters are being assessed. Conclusion: The HALLMARQ Trial will provide new insights into the frontline treatment of ALL in adults \u226560 years old as well as confirm the clinical benefit of VSLI monotherapy demonstrated in the Phase 2 RALLY Study that supported the initial product approval. HALLMARQ is based on a Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA and is currently enrolling. *On behalf of the HALLMARQ investigators.
