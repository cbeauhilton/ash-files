    "abstract_text": "The clinical characteristics and prognosis remain unclear for nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma. The aim of this study is to determine the clinical features and outcome. 26 patients diagnosed as nasal-type NK/T cell lymphoma were included in the analysis. Immunophenotype was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining for LCA, CD79\u03b1, CD20, CD56, CD3, CD45RO, All the cases of nasal NK/T cell lymphoma were LCA, The positivity rates of CD45RO and CD56 were 89.8%, and 66%, respectively. Tumor cells didn\u2019t express antigens of B and histiocyte, According to Ann Arbor system, 2, 7, 12, and 5 patients had stage I, II, III, and IV. 24 patients received combined chemotherapy(CHOP plus Ara-c) and radiotherapy, and 2 patients received chemotherapy alone. The disease is characterized by predominant young males, a propensity for nodal involvement, frequent stage II\u2013III diseases, low frequency of elevated LDH, low-risk international prognostic index (IPI), high sensitivity to radiotherapy, and intermediate sensitivity to chemotherapy. The 3-year overall survival and progression-free survival for all patients were 88% and 71%, respectively The age, B symptoms, stage, and IPI were important prognostic factors. Combined chemotherapy(CHOP plus Ara-c) and radiotherapy tended to improve the survival for patients with stage and II or III diseases. The distant extranodal dissemination were the primary failure patterns. nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma appears to have distinct clinical characteristics and favorable outcomes.",
