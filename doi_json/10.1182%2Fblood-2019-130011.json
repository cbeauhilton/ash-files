    "abstract_text": "Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia (WM), a malignant B-cell lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma representing about 1% of all cases. To better understand the WM pathogenesis, we performed large-scale data-driven proteomic profile of WM tumor cells associated with tumor-driven immune changes in the tumor microenvironment of 66 bone marrow (BM) samples from WM patients compared to 10 age-matched healthy donors (HD) by time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) technology. Our workflow has been designed based on extensive 3 CyTOF antibody panels to evaluate WM tumor within B cell lymphopoiesis concurrently with immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment in WM by state-of-art technology CyTOF. To map B cell lymphomagenesis in WM, we defined whole spectrum of maturation of B cell development, from hematopoietic stem cells and B cell precursors through immature B cells, transitional B cells, and na\u00efve B cells together with memory un-switched and switched B cells, plasmablasts and plasma cells in BM samples of WM patients by positive and negative co-expression of 13 B cell-stage specific markers. Various immunophenotyping aberrancies within WM B lymphomagenesis were associated with WM clones characterized by significant increase of 11 B subset clusters from un-switched and switched memory B cells to plasma cells. Interestingly, WM clusters differ in intra-clonal expression of activation surface molecules (CD23, CD24, CD25, CD81, CD329, CD200, and CD319); transcriptional factors and regulators controlling B cell development (MYD88, Bcl-6, IRF-4, sXBP-1, and FGFR-3) and stemness-related markers (Oct3/4, Nanog, Sox-2, c-Myc, and Notch-1) in WM supporting the idea of sub-clonal heterogeneity insight of WM tumor. Moreover, decrease in cell frequency of B cell precursors (pro-B and pre-BI), naive B cells, and plasmablasts were observed in WM patients versus HD. To generate a comprehensive view of the tumor microenvironment, we observed significant upregulation of g/dT cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T effector cells, CD8+ T effector memory cells, monocytes, and neutrophils immune subsets and downregulation of immature T cells, CD8+ T na\u00efve cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, myelo/mono progenitor clusters. Ibrutinib (IBRU) treatment has been effective in relapsed/refractory WM patients; therefore highest numbers of WM patients were receiving IBRU therapy in our cohort. IBRU treated WM patients had decreased frequency of naive B, CD4+ T naive cells and specific clusters of un-switched and switched memory B cells. Moreover, responder versus non-responders to IBRU therapy revealed increase of CD8+T effector memory cells. In sum, correspondence analysis reflecting data of each patient and immune subsets revealed stratification of WM patients with reflection on their clinical outcome, therefore providing the rational for prediction of WM patient status.
