    "abstract_text": "Despite significant advancements in the treatment of paediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL), ALL remains one of the most challenging adult malignancies. Outcome of adult B-ALL is poor with only 40% 5-year event-free survival compared to >80% in children. B-ALL is characterised by the acquisition of chromosomal abnormalities and many are strong predictors of outcome. The difference in the prevalence of cytogenetic subtypes and specific genomic abnormalities observed between adult and childhood ALL suggests a difference in tumour biology that may contribute to the differences in patient outcome. Detailed analysis of the paediatric B-ALL genome have revealed a plethora of abnormalities targeting key pathways. Although specific alterations have been investigated in adult and adolescent B-ALL, studies of the genomic landscape remain scarce. In this study we set-out to define the genomic landscape of adolescent and adult relapsed B-ALL. Genomic backtracking analysis of sequential diagnostic and relapse samples revealed known and novel abnormalities that may play a role in chemoresistance and disease progression in these tumours. DNA was isolated from the diagnostic and relapse samples from 12 adolescents/adult patients (5 female and 7 male) diagnosed with B-ALL. Eight of the 12 patients had remission samples available. Known cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 7 patients: high hyperdiploid, t(1;19), t(8;14) and t(4;11) rearrangements. Two cases were positive for the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The mean age at diagnosis was 36.8 years (range 16-59 years) of which 10 relapsed early, within 2 years of initial diagnosis. DNA for the 12 diagnostic, 12 relapse and 8 remission sample were hybridised to the Affymetrix SNP6.0 array to determine copy number abnormalities (CNAs). The mutational landscape was captured for 4 cases using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V4+UTR kit and sequenced to depths of 200X. The incidences of the most prevalent abnormalities in paediatric B-ALL were determined in each adult/adolescent sample: CDKN2A/B 88% (21/24), IKZF1 20% (5/24), PAX5 8% (2/24), ETV6 0% (0/24), RB1 8% (2/24), BTG1 8% (2/24) and EBF1 17% (4/24). Deletions of CDKN2A/B were detected in all but one patient. In 9 cases the abnormality was seen at both diagnosis and relapse and one case had a de novo deletion at relapse. A further case had a sub-clone harbouring CDKN2A/B deletion at diagnosis that emerged as the dominant clone at relapse. Deletion of CDKN2A/B has been associated with poor overall survival and has been reported at high incidence in relapsed adult BCR-ABL1-ALL, but the association with prognosis and relapse in other subtypes has not been confirmed. Genomic backtracking analysis of the matched diagnostic and relapse samples identified, on average, 36 somatic mutations at relapse that were either not detected or were only detectable in a sub-clone at diagnosis. An average of 0.05 mutations per Mb were computationally predicted to be damaging to the function of the protein. Novel d e novo mutations seen at relapse were identified in cancer-related genes: FAT4 , CDCA7 and PVRL4 . Sequencing at depth of >200X demonstrates the ability to detect mutations in the resistant clone which could be involved in disease progression. Mutations in the ATP-binding cassette transporter gene, ABCC9, were identified in a sub-clone at diagnosis at a variant frequency of 5% (13/268 reads) and at 43% (113/260) in the relapse sample. ABCC9 is involved in drug resistance suggesting a potential role in chremoresistance in this patient. In conclusion, in-depth genomic analysis and whole-exome sequencing of matched diagnostic and relapse samples in adult/adolescent B-ALL has identified known and novel genomic abnormalities. Deletion of CDKN2A/B was prevalent in 11 of the 12 cases confirming the importance of this region in relapsed B-ALL. We have identified novel mutations in genes associated with chemoresistance and tumorigenesis: ABCC9, FAT4, CDCA7 and PVRL4 . Our study provides the most comprehensive genetic portrait of adult relapsed B-ALL to date and is a significant step to defining the genetic causes of disease progression and chemoresistance.
