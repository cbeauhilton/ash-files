    "abstract_text": "Deregulated expression of the proto-oncogenes BCL6 and c-MYC caused by chromosomal translocation or somatic hypermutation is common in non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma derived from germinal center (GC) B cells, including diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL). Normal GC B cells express BCL6, whereas, surprisingly, they do not express c-MYC, suggesting that the expression of this oncogene in BL and DLBCL (20% of cases) is ectopic ( Klein, U. et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A  100 , 2639 \u20132644, 2003 ). Here we report that c-MYC is absent in proliferating GC B cells because it is transcriptionally suppressed by BCL6, as demonstrated by the presence of specific BCL6 binding sites in the c-MYC promoter region and by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showing that BCL6 is bound to these sites in vivo. Thus, c-MYC escapes BCL6-mediated suppression in lymphoma leading to the co-expression of the two transcription factors, an event never observed in immunohistochemical and gene expression profile analysis of normal GC B cells. Surprisingly, co-immunoprecipitation experiments and in vitro binding experiments indicate that, when co-expressed, BCL6 and c-MYC are physically bound in a novel complex detectable in DLBCL and BL cell lines as well as in primary lymphoma cases. The formation of the BCL6/c-MYC complex has several significant functional consequences on the function of both c-MYC and BCL6: 1) a two fold, BCL6-binding dependent increase in c-MYC half-life, an event that has been shown to contribute to its oncogenic activation; 2) a synergistic increase in the ability of both BCL6 and c-MYC to suppress MIZ1-activated transcription of the p21CIP cell cycle arrest gene; 3) MYC-dependent inhibition of BCL6 acetylation by p300, an event that physiologically inactivates BCL6 via c-MYC-mediated recruitment of HDAC. Notably, the pathologic co-expression of c-MYC and BCL6 was shown to have pathologic consequences in vivo, since double transgenic BCL6/c-MYC mice display accelerated lymphoma development and the appearance of a novel GC-derived tumor phenotype not recognizable in single transgenic animals and containing the pathologic c-MYC/BCL6 complex. Thus, the pathologic co-expression and illegitimate physical interaction of BCL6 and c-MYC leads to an increase in the constitutive activity of both oncogenes. These results identify a novel mechanism of oncogenic function for BCL6 and c-MYC and a novel tumor-specific protein complex of potential therapeutic interest."
