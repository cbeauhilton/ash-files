    "abstract_text": "Prophylactic therapy with rFVIII has been shown to have a significant positive impact on the treatment of Hemophilia A. One of the impediments to effective prophylaxis is the requirement for frequent injections necessitated by the 12\u201314 hour circulating half-life of FVIII. We have evaluated a number of approaches to modify FVIII to reduce the need for frequent injections. In one approach, the active form of FVIII was stabilized by addition of a disulfide linkage between the A2 and A3 domains. As previously reported 1 , these molecules exhibited prolonged FVIII activity in a number of in vitro assays following activation. In vivo characterization of these molecules is in progress. Other approaches focused on increasing the circulating half-life of FVIII. In an attempt to reduce FVIII clearance by the liver receptor LRP, site-directed mutations in the reported LRP binding region of the FVIII A2 domain were generated. Twenty mutants, with single amino acid changes, were analyzed in mouse and rabbit recovery studies and no significant increase in recovery was observed. Since the point mutants may not have covered a large enough surface of the LRP binding domains, polyethlylene glygol (PEG) modification was used to disrupt a larger surface area. Previously, attachment of PEG moieties to FVIII had been shown to lead to an increase in plasma half-life in animal models; however, standard pegylation chemistries result in significant product heterogeneity and thus may not be suitable for commercial production. We have developed a novel method, based on protein engineering, to introduce PEG to specific cysteine residues on the surface of FVIII. Using this method, different molecular weight PEGs have been conjugated to sites in the A1, A2 or A3 domains of FVIII. Analysis of the pegylated proteins confirms that the attachment of PEG is highly specific to the engineered site. The pegylated products retain activity based on the two stage chromogenic assay, but exhibit reduced activity when analyzed by the one stage coagulation assay. Pharmacokinetic studies, performed in mouse and rabbit, show that pegylation increases half-life in a manner that is proportional to PEG molecular weight. Using a number of injury models in hemophilic mice, the pegylated molecules have been shown to be efficacious in stopping bleeds. The prospects for using site-specific pegylation of FVIII to produce a therapeutic for treatment of hemophilia A will be discussed.",
