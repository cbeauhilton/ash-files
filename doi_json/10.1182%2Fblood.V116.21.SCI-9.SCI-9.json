    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-9 The genes encoding factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX) were cloned 25 years ago. Since then, substantial translational application of this knowledge has been witnessed. First, genetic analysis of hemophilia has enabled a detailed understanding of the types and patterns of mutation responsible for these conditions. This knowledge has provided important biological insights into the mechanisms underlying mutation generation and has also formed the basis for precise molecular diagnosis for hemophilia carriers and potentially affected fetuses. In addition, the hemophilic genotype is the best-characterized and strongest predictor for the development of inhibitor generation in previously untreated patients. The second benefit deriving from the genetic characterization of the hemophilias has been the production of recombinant coagulation factor concentrates. Over the past 20 years, the use of recombinant factor concentrates has increased dramatically and we are currently witnessing a flurry of activity to develop second-generation, enhanced concentrates. The major objective of these projects is to facilitate clotting factor prophylaxis through the production of concentrates whose half-lives are extended, thus reducing the frequency of factor administration. These endeavors are utilizing a variety of approaches, but most are focused on either chemical modification of the factors through polymer conjugates or the generation of fusion proteins with immunoglobulin or albumin to take advantage of the recycling function of the neonatal Fc receptor. The first wave of these new products is now undergoing early phase clinical studies, and while substantial benefits for FIX half-life extension appear achievable, FVIII half-life modification may be more challenging. Finally, molecular genetic knowledge of the hemophilias has resulted in the pursuit of strategies to utilize genetic approaches to effect long-term \u201ccures\u201d of the disease. These initiatives have resulted in several small phase I/II trials of viral vector-based gene transfer but have also formed the basis of mutation-specific therapies such as a translational read-through approach being undertaken in patients with nonsense mutations. Currently, two phase I/II trials are in progress with liver-directed AAV FIX gene transfer in which two different AAV serotypes are being evaluated. These studies follow on from two previous AAV clinical trials in which the major obstacle to clinical benefit appears to have been the host immune response to the vector. There is considerable interest in the outcomes of these new studies. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
