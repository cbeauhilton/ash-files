    "abstract_text": "To analysis the cytomegalovirus\uff08CMV\uff09 infection rate and median time which the CMV-DNA was positive for the first time. Simultaneously, to demonstrete the risk factors associated with CMV infection and CMV disease distribution and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\uff08allo-HSCT).A retrospective study among 108 patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) was conducted during 1 st Jan 2004 and 31 st Mar 2014 in Zhongda hospital.The infection rate of CMV was 52.78%(57/108), the median time of CMV infection was 44d, especially during 30d~100d. The univariate analysis showed that CMV infection rate was associated with the HLA-identical situation between the donor and recipient, whether the use of Anti-human thymus globulin(ATG) conditioning regimen, neutropenic period after transplantation exceeded 10d and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Multivariate analysis showed that CMV infection rate was associated with neutropenic period after transplantation which exceeded 10d and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).The mortality of the patients who had CMV infection was 10/17 and the mortality of CMV interstitial pneumonia was higher. CMV infection was one of the most commonly happened infection after allo-HSCT. To reduce the incidence of CMV disease and mortality, the best choice of Allo-HSCT was HLA-identical donor, ATG should be used during the process, and neutropenic period should be reduced less than 10 days. Moreover, it is necessary to strengthen the treatment of CMV infection actively. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
