    "abstract_text": "Introduction Ruxolitinib (RUX) is an FDA-approved oral, selective inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea or intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF). Preclinical studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that RUX in combination with the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide (LEN) and dexamethasone shows marked anti-myeloma effects both in vitro and in vivo . Furthermore, MUC1 is responsible for LEN resistance in MM cells, and RUX blocks its expression in multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Thus, RUX may restore sensitivity to LEN. RUX also downregulates PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression on MM cells and reduces tumor stimulatory M2 macrophage polarization in MM bone marrow. Therefore, a phase 1 trial was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of RUX in combination with LEN and the steroid methylprednisolone (MP) for relapsed/refractory (RR) MM patients who had previously been treated with LEN/steroids and a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and showed progressive disease at study entry. Methods A traditional 3+3 dose escalation design was used to enroll subjects in four cohorts with expansion once a MTD was determined. Subjects received RUX twice daily continuously, LEN daily on d1-21 of a 28-d cycle and MP orally every other day. In DL0, patients received RUX 5 mg, LEN 5 mg, and MP 40 mg. In DL+1 and +2, both doses of LEN and MP remained unchanged and RUX was escalated to 10 and 15 mg, respectively. DL+3 escalated LEN to 10 mg with MP unchanged and RUX at 15 mg. Primary endpoints were safety, clinical benefit rate (CBR) and overall response rate (ORR). Results Thirty-four patients have been enrolled, and 31 were evaluable for response as of July 13, 2018. The median age was 68 years (range, 49-81), and 20 (59%) were male. Patients received a median of 6 prior treatments including lenalidomide and a PI. No DLTs occurred, and DL+3 was expanded (n=25). Among all 31 evaluable patients, the CBR and ORR were 48% and 39%, respectively (1 CR, 9 PR, 2 VGPR, and 3 MR), and 11 and 5 showed SD and PD, respectively. Notably, all 15 patients achieving \u2265 MR were refractory to LEN (i.e. progressed while on or within 8 weeks of last dosage). The median PFS for all evaluable patients was 7.4 months. Grade 3/4 adverse events included transient thrombocytopenia (11.1%), anemia (8.8%), neutropenia (6.7%), hypoxia (4.4%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (4.4%). Common serious adverse events included abdominal pain (6.7%), gastrointestinal bleeding (6.7%) and hypoxia (6.7 %). Conclusions This phase 1 trial demonstrates for the first time that a JAK inhibitor, RUX, can overcome refractoriness to LEN and steroids for RRMM patients. This all oral regimen was well tolerated, and reversible Grade 3/4 cytopenias occurred in only a small minority of patients. These promising results are leading to other clinical trials using immunomodulatory agents, steroids and RUX, for treating RRMM patients, and this may represent a new therapeutic approach for these patients.
