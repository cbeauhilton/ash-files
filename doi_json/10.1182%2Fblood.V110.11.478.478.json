    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic transplantation continues to have a role in the management of high risk CML. However the place of reduced intensity (RIC) versus myeloablative conditioning (MAC) is uncertain in younger patients. A total of 2331 first HSCT\u2019s performed from 1998\u20132005 were reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry, RIC was used in 276 and MAC in 2055. Overall survivals were similar for the first 9 months. After 9 months the survival curves separated (HR for RIC 1.8, 95% CI 1.2\u20132.8 p=0.01). All estimates were based on time dependent Cox models and landmark analyses at 9 months. EBMT score was higher in the RIC group (score 0\u20132, 27% vs 52% p9 months was worse in RIC patients with a low propensity score when treated in centres with 9 months was equal in centres treating \u22655 patients with RIC who had a high propensity score (HR 0.8 CI 0.4\u20131.6). The figures below illustrate this showing the cumulative risk of non-relapse mortality, relapse and death after relapse for these groups estimated in a competing risk setting. Conclusion: Transplant centre experience and patient selection impact on outcome. Survival with RIC HSCT is inferior to MAC except for the subgroup of patients with a high propensity score transplanted at centres with \u22655 RIC HSCT.
