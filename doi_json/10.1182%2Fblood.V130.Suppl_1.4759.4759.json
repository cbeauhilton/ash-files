    "abstract_text": "Endocrine complications may be seen in thalassemia major patients due to iron overload or deficient chelation regimens. IGF-1 and ferritin levels were evaluated in 68 beta-thalaasemia major patients in the ages of 2-29 years for growth retardation. The patients were composed of 43 males and 25 females. The man age of total population was 15.04\u00b16.57 years. The mean of ferritin was 1499.67\u00b11471.50ng/ml. The mean of IGF-1 was 130.90\u00b197.64. The correlation coefficient for ferritin and IGF-1 for Pearson was -2.47 (Figure 1). This finding shows us negative correlation between ferritin and IGF-1 levels. Most of the patients were in adolescent ages and it shows us scheduled follow-up visits for endocrine complications are very important. Among this patients , 2 patients were taking growth hormon.
