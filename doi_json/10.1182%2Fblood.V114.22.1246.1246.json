    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1246 Poster Board I-268 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is characterized by a variable clinical course. Genomic aberrations as detected by FISH analysis and the mutational status of the IgVH genes have been found to have prognostic clinical significance with unmutated IgVH genes associated with clinically more aggressive disease. Previous studies have suggested that unmutated IgVH B-CLL is associated with increased chromosomal instability and increased chromosomal aberrations leading to accelerated disease progression. We recently performed a high-throughput, high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in a cohort of B-CLL patients. Fifty-eight patients have been analyzed by using the Sureprint G3 microarray (one million probes, Agilent). Our working hypothesis was that we would see increased genomic aberrations and instability in the unmutated IgVH group. The total number of copy number aberrations and total megabases (Mb) deleted or gained per genome were used as a surrogate marker for genomic instability. Variations in chromosomal aberrations in various VH families were also evaluated. B-CLL with unmutated IgVH genes utilized members of the VH1, VH3, VH4 and VH5 families with VH1-69 the most prevalent. B-CLL with mutated IgVH genes utilized VH families VH1, VH2, VH3, VH4, and VH6. Considerable variation was seen in the number of genomic abnormalities between cases. Overall, 315 abnormalities have been identified (236 deletions and 79 gains), with a median of 4 copy-number abnormalities per patient (range 0-32). In patients with IgVH mutational status available the median number of chromosomal aberrations in the mutated group was 5 (range 1-17) and unmutated group was 4 (range 0-20). Copy number deletions were significantly more common than chromosomal gains for the total group and in both the unmutated and mutated IgVH gene groups. Mean number of megabases (Mb) of DNA deleted in the unmutated IgVH group was 17.80Mb (standard deviation 24.17 Mb, median 6.63 Mb, range 0 - 90.55Mb) and 40.65 Mb in the mutated IgVH group (standard deviation 86.04 Mb, median 15.35Mb, range 0 \u2013 307.57Mb). Mean number of Mb gained in the unmutated group was 37.74Mb (standard deviation 57.58Mb, median 0.44Mb, range 0 \u2013 132.47Mb) and 32.99Mb (standard deviation 59.76Mb, median 0.14Mb, range 0 \u2013 172.50Mb) in the mutated group. Nine patients had B-CLL with VH1-69 genes and 8 of them were unmutated. Median number of chromosomal deletions was 2 and gains also 2 (ranges 0 \u2013 8 deletions and 0 \u2013 4 gains) for this group. Similar findings were seen for the other VH families. These results initially suggest that total copy number variations do not account for the observed clinical differences between mutated and unmutated IgVH B-CLL. The catalogue of potentially clinically relevant chromosomal abnormalities found in this aCGH study is being currently evaluated.
