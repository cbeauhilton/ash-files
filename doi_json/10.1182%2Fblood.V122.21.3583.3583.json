    "abstract_text": "Congenital Hemophilia A and B treatment may be complicated by the development of inhibitors to the coagulation factors used in the replacement therapies. In such cases factor replacement becomes ineffective, and use of a bypassing agent is needed to treat or prevent bleedings. A recombinant form of activated Factor VII has been available for this purpose. In this study, a new recombinant human Factor VIIa (rhFVIIa, LR769) produced by LFB/rEVO Biologics was tested. The goal is to provide patients with Hemophilia A and B who develop inhibitors a cost-effective alternative treatment option. Recombinant Human Factor VII was activated during the purification process to yield a highly homogenous rhFVIIa product (LR769). Kinetic enzyme assays and binding studies were used to characterize LR769. Active site titration demonstrated approximately 1 mole of active site per mole of protein. The K m and k cat for activation of FX and FIX were determined using an assay containing recombinant human tissue factor and phospholipid. The K d for binding to soluble tissue factor was 22.3 \u00b1 1.7 nM as measured using a FX activation assay. The apparent second order rate constant for inactivation by human plasma antithrombin was 5.9 \u00b1 0.4 x10 3 M -1 sec -1 . In all kinetic assays, LR769 behaved as expected for rhFVIIa. Binding studies with isolated human platelets were performed by FACS and indicated that binding was dependent on Ca +2 . Activation of the platelets with thrombin and convulxin increased the binding of LR769. Binding of LR769 to Endothelial Protein C Receptor (EPCR) on the surface of cultured HEK 293 cells was determined by FACS analysis and confirmed that LR769 binds to EPCR. This was further demonstrated with a surface plasmon resonance assay using purified soluble EPCR. Binding to EPCR was dependent on Ca +2 , and could be stimulated by Mg +2 . Specificity of the binding was confirmed by the fact that it was inhibited by excess Protein C. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
