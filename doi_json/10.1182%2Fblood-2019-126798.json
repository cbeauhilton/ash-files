    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a rare disease entity characterized by selective growth of lymphoma cells in the lumina of small vessels. IVLBCL has been listed in the WHO classification, which improves recognition of the disease. However, no standard therapy has been established based on the results of prospective studies. We previously reported promising efficacy of rituximab (R)-containing chemotherapy for IVLBCL (JCO 2008) and a high incidence of central nervous system (CNS) recurrence (25% at 3 y) after R-chemotherapy (Lancet Oncol 2009, Cancer Sci 2010). To explore a more effective first-line treatment, we conducted a phase 2 trial of R-CHOP combined with CNS prophylaxis including R-high-dose methotrexate (R-HDMTX) and intrathecal chemotherapy with MTX, cytarabine (Ara-C), and prednisolone (PSL) (IT). Methods: Major inclusion criteria were untreated, histologically confirmed IVLBCL, age 20-79 y, ECOG PS 0-3, and no apparent CNS involvement at diagnosis. Patients received 3 cycles of R-CHOP followed by 2 cycles of R-HDMTX (3.5 g/m 2 ; 2 g/m 2 for \u226570 y) every 2 weeks, and 3 additional cycles of R-CHOP. IT (MTX 15 mg, Ara-C 40 mg, PSL 10 mg) was performed twice during the first 3 cycles of R-CHOP and twice during the final 3 cycles of R-CHOP (4 times in total). If patients achieved complete response (CR), they were observed without any therapy until relapse or disease progression. The primary endpoint was 2-y progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints included 2-y overall survival (OS), CR rate, cumulative incidence of CNS recurrence at 2 y, patterns of progression, and adverse events. The threshold 2-y PFS was estimated to be 35%, with expected 2-y PFS estimated to be 60%. With a statistical power of 90% and a one-sided, type I error of 5%, a projected sample size of 37 was calculated in anticipation of 10% ineligible patients. The trial was registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000005707). Results: 38 IVLBCL patients were enrolled between June 2011 and July 2016. One patient was found to be ineligible after completion of the protocol treatment due to a past history of lymphoma. The protocol treatment was completed in 34 (89%) of 38 patients. The diagnosis of IVLBCL was histologically confirmed by central pathological review in all enrolled patients. The baseline characteristics of the 37 eligible patients were: male sex, 16 (43%); median age, 66 (range 38-78) y; ECOG PS >1, 15 (41%); stage IV, 37 (100%); serum LDH >ULN, 36 (97%); WBC <4,000/\u03bcL, 11 (30%); Hgb <11g/dL, 30 (81%); PLT <10 5 /\u03bcL, 17 (46%); and IPI HI/H, 33 (89%) patients. The following clinical symptoms were observed before treatment initiation: B symptoms, 30 (81%); hypoxemia, 10 (27%); neurological symptoms, 3 (8%);exanthema, 4 (11%); hepatomegaly, 15 (40%); splenomegaly, 28 (76%); and hemophagocytosis, 8 (22%) patients. In the 37 eligible patients, the CR rate was 84% (95%CI: 68-94%). With a median follow-up of 3.9 (range, 2.0-6.6) y, 2-y PFS was 76% (95%CI: 59-87%), 2-y OS was 92% (95%CI: 77-97%), and the cumulative incidence of CNS recurrence at 2 y was 2.7% (95%CI: 0.2-12%) (Fig. 1). Only one patient had CNS relapse during follow-up. Of all 38 enrolled pts, there were no treatment-related deaths. G4 non-hematological adverse events were febrile neutropenia, hypokalemia, and low blood pressure in one patient each. Major G3 non-hematological toxicities were febrile neutropenia (32%) and hypokalemia (26%). G3 and G4 lymphocytopenia were observed in 95% and 50% and thrombocytopenia in 40% and 24% of patients, respectively. All toxicities were manageable. Conclusion: This phase 2 trial met its primary endpoint and showed favorable outcomes with a low cumulative incidence of CNS recurrence and acceptable toxicity profiles. These results indicate that R-CHOP combined with CNS prophylaxis including R-HDMTX and IT could be a reasonable treatment option for untreated IVLBCL without apparent CNS involvement at diagnosis.
