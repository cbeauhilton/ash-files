    "abstract_text": "The treatment options for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) under inferior performance status (i.e. senior patients, MDS transformed AML, and patients with proven invasive fungal disease) are limited. The conventional \"3+7\" (idarubicin plus cytarabine) induction for those patients can be either too toxic, which leads to higher mortality rate, or requires prolonged recovery time thus raise medical cost. And the delay of consolidation may compromise outcome thus cause early relapse in such patients. Giving the rationale from the designing art of CPX-351, the prolonged IV time requirement for cytarabine, as well as mini-transplantation for AML treatment, at least in part, reflects the philosophy of a longer exposure to the chemo agent can be a more effective treatment approach for leukemia. On the other hand, the D-CAG protocol, which indicated an encouraging result for elderly patients with AML, indicated effectiveness of the strategy with reduced intensity. However, the cyto-toxic effect of decitabine with standard dose (20mg/m2) could still lead to severe treatment adverse events (AEs) thus raise the need of optimization of D-CAG regimen for patients with inferior PS. When considering the low dose hypo-methylation agent (HMA) can trigger the innate immunity response, the unique effect of homoharringtonine, as well as the effectiveness of CAG, we designed this DHCAG protocol following the principle of \"longer exposure, lower intensity preceded by priming\" and observed an unexpected excellent outcome with high CR rate, low induction failure and treatment mortality, as well as a higher cost effective value for patients with AML, when compared to \"3+7\" protocol, whom under inferior PS. From March 2016 - January 2018, we initiated this pilot study and investigated the safety and efficiency of this DHCAG protocol in patients with AML under poor PS. We enrolled 25 patients and administer the regimen as followings: i) G-CSF: 5\u03bcg/kg used when WBC 1*10^9/L then increase the dosage of homoharringtonine to 2mg/m2); iv) Cytarabine:10mg/m2 q12h at day 1-14 subcutaneous injection (if WBC >20*10^9/L then increase to 100mg/m2 by 24h CIV, or 50mg/m2 q12h by subcutaneous injection). The primary end point was complete hematologic remission, defined as a bone marrow blast cells \u22645%, Neutrophils in peripheral blood \u22651.0X10 9 /L, hemoglobin\u226590g/L, and platelets \u2265100X10 9 /L and no any evidence of extramedullary leukemic infiltration; Secondary end points included numbers of adverse events, length of hospital stay, medical costs, and quality of life as measured with the use of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) questionnaire. Among the 25 patients in the study, 23 completed the induction therapy. And 21/25 patients had a hematologic complete remission after a median time of 19 days. Once complete remission had occurred, all 21 patients received post-remission treatment for another 5 cycles of DHCAG. Median follow-up was 14 months (range, 8 to 19) by June 2018. Interestingly, regardless of grade 3-4 myelo-suppression occurred all of our patients during induction, eight patients did not experienced grade 3-4 myelo-suppression during the following cycles. The median hospital stay is 22 days. The median of total medical costs for induction was $9,815 (range, $5,053 to $16,336) vs $14,705 for \"3+7\" induction protocol (history control. Data unpublished). Patients resumed their usual lifestyle during post-remission therapy, and their quality of life was rated as nearly normal on the FACT-G questionnaire. At the time of the last follow-up, seven patients had had a hematologic relapse. The results of our pilot study, in which we tested a priming based, low dose and longer exposure in 25 patients with AML under poor PS, showed that the treatment was safe, effective, and economical. A prospective multicenter, randomized trial comparing DHCAG with IA is now under way in China. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
