    "abstract_text": "Antitumor effects of metformin are widely known. Unfortunately their use in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia is limited. Study design The study consisted of two stages Phase 1 : Cell assay adding metformin (40mM) assessing the viability and cell cycle in the cell line molt 4 Phase 2 : Pilot study adding Metformin (850mg three time day) during the pre-treatment with steroids and the induction remission phase versus a control group (2:1 randomization) Statistical analysis Chi-square analysis was used to corroborate the hypothesis. The odds ratio was calculated for both, the absence of Good steroid response and refractory leukemia. Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves were used for the survival analysis Results Celular assay . Metformin inhibited cell viability at 120hours reducing the percentage of cells in phase S. Clinical assay . 151 patients were studied, 44 (29.1%) on Metformin arm, of these 59.1% ( n=26) archived a GSR compared with the control group (26.2%, n=28). A greater number of complete remission were presented in Metformin arm (81.8% versus 57.9%) shown to be a protective factor for GSR and complete remissions (odds ratio ; 0.2454 y 0.3062 respectively). In the Cox regression analysis, Metformin significantly impact in the global survival (p=0,012,95% IC) versus the other variables studied. Conclusions Metformin is useful both in vivo and in vitro treatment of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
