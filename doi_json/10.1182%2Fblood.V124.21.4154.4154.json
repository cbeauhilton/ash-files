    "abstract_text": "Proteins of the Bin-amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) and Fes-CIP4 homology BAR (F-BAR) families bind and deform membranes, promoting in cells tubular invaginations reminiscent of the platelet open canalicular system (OCS) and megakaryocyte (MK) demarcation membrane system (DMS). Here we investigated the role of the F-BAR protein PACSIN2 in platelets and MKs. Spinning disk laser fluorescence confocal microscopy showed that PACSIN2 co-localized with the von Willebrand factor receptor subunit GPIb\u03b1 at the openings of the OCS in platelets. Endogenous and over-expressed PACSIN2 associated with anastomosing tubular structures reminiscent of the pre-DMS in mouse bone marrow MKs. Pacsin2 -null mice had mild thrombocytopenia and polycythemia, MK hyperplasia and splenomegaly. Pacsin2 -null mice had a bleeding disorder, as evidenced by significantly prolonged tail bleeding and delayed in vivo thrombus formation following FeCl 3 vascular injury, which was normalized by injection of WT platelets. However, Pacsin2 -null platelets expressed P-selectin and activated the integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 normally in response to stimulation with thrombin and the GPVI-specific collagen-related peptide. In contrast, Pacsin2 -null platelets had abnormal flattened morphology, with more and narrower OCS channels on their surface, compared to WT platelets. Together, the data indicate that the F-BAR protein PACSIN2 orchestrates the intracellular membrane architecture of platelets, thereby regulating their in vivo hemostatic functions.
