    "abstract_text": "Loss of fertility is a major concern in young women undergoing high dose chemotherapy (HDT). Although it is generally accepted that therapy of the myeloabelative range is related with a high rate of fertility loss, we observed during the last years eight spontaneous pregnancies with normal deliveries in young women after bone marrow transplantation. Seven patients (pt\u2019s) were with lymphoma and MM and were conditioned with BEAM regimen (n=6) and melphalan 200mg/sm (n=1) prior to an autologous SCT, while one patient had a secondary AML and underwent BEAM primed autologous SCT and Busulfex/FA primed allogeneic BMT. The median age at transplant of this group was 28y and median time from transplant to pregnancy was 25 months. More than 100 women of 18\u201340y.o were transplanted in our center during this period; however, obviously the fertility rate cannot be calculated as it is related with additional parameters including survival, post transplant complications and mainly patient\u2019s preferences. Naturally we observed during the same period many young patients with ovarian failure post transplant, as well as one successful pregnancy from a cryopreserved embryo. Methods. We Therefore initiated in October 2000 a fertility preservation program in which all women of 18 \u2013 40y.o were offered a pretransplant IVF with embryo preservation, and/or ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC), according to their clinical status. 651 pt\u2019s were transplanted in our center in the last 44 months, of which 81 were women of 18\u201341y.o that were all enrolled in this program. Results. Seven pt\u2019s of this group (8.6%) underwent IVF. The major causes of denying IVF were the need to delay BMT for more than clinically accepted, prolonged preexisting ovarian failure, lack of a suitable partner and patient\u2019s preference. Seventeen pt\u2019s (21%) underwent OTC. The major causes of denying OTC were patient\u2019s preference (mainly due to no evidence of success with this method) and thrombocytopenia/neutropenia. During this period: One patient of this group was fertilized with her cryopreserved embryos 32 months after transplant and is at her 16 week of pregnancy. One patient underwent a successful transplantation of her cryopreserved ovarian tissue 2.5 years after HDC while in a documented ovarian failure, and gave birth to a healthy baby on June 2005. The OTC of this patient was performed after cis-platinum containing salvage therapy for relapsing NHL, prior to BEAM primed SCT, and immediately after a failure of hormonal stimulation for IVF. One patient underwent a cryopreserved ovarian tissue transplantation on July 2005 Conclusions : 1. Spontanous pregnancy after HDT, mainly at the younger age, is not a rare phenomenon. 2. Most young patients prior to HDT are not eligible for IVF. 3. Pretransplant ovarian tissue cryopreservation is a feasible tool in this set-up. The first success with this method is promising.",
