    "abstract_text": "We have previously reported an improved therapeutic index (TI) for JNJ-9375 vs apixaban in rat and cynomolgus monkey models of venous thrombosis and bleeding. We have also reported that JNJ-9375 preferentially inhibited the fibrin component of the thrombus without significant impact on the platelet component under low and high shear conditions in a human translational model of thrombosis (Badimon chamber model). We hypothesized that the novel mode of action of JNJ-9375 which by selectively inhibiting exosite 1 substrates from binding to thrombin (such as fibrinogen and PAR-1) may allow for other thrombin interactions at the active site and exosite 2 including platelet activation by PAR-4 and GP1b. In the present studies, we have compared the antithrombotic effects of JNJ-9375, the active site thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa inhibitor apixaban in well characterized and widely used rat AV-shunt and carotid ferric chloride models of venous and arterial thrombosis, respectively. JNJ-9375, dabigatran and apixaban all maximally inhibited thrombus formation in a dose dependent manner in the rat AV-shunt model of venous thrombosis. Significant inhibition of thrombus weights of 50%, 44% and 57% were observed at 0.3 mg/kg, i.v., 0.1 mg/kg, i.v. and 1 mg/kg, i.v. with JNJ-9375, dabigatran and apixaban respectively. Dose dependent prolongation in coagulation parameters were also observed ex-vivo with JNJ-9375 (TT, ECT, aPTT and PT), dabigatran (TT, ECT, aPTT) and apixaban (aPTT and PT). In addition, there were dose dependent increases in drug exposure. In the rat ferric chloride model of arterial thrombosis, JNJ-9375, dabigatran and apixaban administration also resulted in dose dependent inhibition of thrombus formation as assessed by the time to occlusion (TTO) of the carotid artery and area under the curve (AUC) for carotid blood flow. However, the dose required to inhibit arterial thrombosis Vs venous thrombosis varied substantially for the different agents. With JNJ-9375 we only observed a significant inhibition of arterial thrombosis (TTO and AUC) at a dose of 10 mg/kg, i.v. (Vs 0.3 mg/kg in the AV-shunt model) which represents a 33-fold shift in the dose required to inhibit arterial thrombosis (Vs venous thrombosis). In contrast, we observed a significant inhibition of arterial thrombosis with dabigatran (AUC) and apixaban (TTO and AUC) at doses of 0.3 mg/kg, i.v. and 3 mg/kg, i.v. (Vs 0.1 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg in the AV-shunt model) respectively. These doses of dabigatran and apixaban represent a 3-fold shift in the dose required to inhibit arterial thrombosis (Vs venous thrombosis). We have also documented dose dependent prolongations in coagulation parameters and drug exposure with all three agents in the these studies. In addition, we performed ex-vivo platelet aggregation in platelet rich plasma with various platelet agonists (ADP, collagen, AA, rat and human thrombin) in those animals dosed with JNJ-9375. As anticipated and consistent with its mechanism of action, JNJ-9375 only inhibited platelet aggregation to thrombin stimulation but not with other platelet agonists confirming the specificity of JNJ-9375. We observed about 50%, >95% and >95% inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation at 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg, i.v. with JNJ-9375 respectively. However, we only observed inhibition of arterial thrombosis at 10 mg/kg. In summary, we have demonstrated dose dependent inhibition of thrombosis with JNJ-9375, dabigatran and apixaban in venous and arterial model of thrombosis in rats. However, we have observed a larger difference in the dose required for inhibition of arterial Vs venous thrombosis with JNJ-9375 (33-fold) compared to a more modest 3-fold shift observed for dabigatran and apixaban. These findings with JNJ-9375 demonstrate an anticoagulant profile that preferentially inhibits fibrin mediated clot formation with a more modest impact on platelet driven thrombosis in the present models. This differential profile may account in part for the improved TI over apixaban we had reported earlier in animal models. This profile suggests JNJ-9375 which is currently in early clinical development may also be more amenable to dosing in combination with antiplatelet therapy for indications such as acute coronary syndromes and needs to be tested experimentally.
