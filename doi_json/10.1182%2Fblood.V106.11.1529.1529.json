    "abstract_text": "VEGF-C secreted by kinds of tumor cells play the key role in lymphangiogenesis via activating tyrosine kinase of VEGFR-3, which is one of most important pathway of infiltration and metastasis of tumor cells. In recent years, the effects of VEGF-C on hematological malignant cells are paid attention. In the current study, the recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1-VEGF-C) and the vacant pcDNA3.1 vector were introduced into the acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line- NB 4 cells (VEGFR-3 + /VEGFR-2 \u2212 ) by lipofectamine mediation and positive clones were screened by G418. The stable expression of VEGF-C was detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western blotting. The proliferation ability of NB 4 /VEGF-C cells is analysed by MTT assay. After NB 4 /VEGF-C cells were induced by ATRA (1\u03bcmol/L), the expression levels of C/EBP \u03b1 gene which can promote myelocytes differentiation and maturation, CD11b on cells surface and morphological variation were analysed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR), flow cytometry analysis (FCM), Wright-Giemsa staining respectively. Furthermore, after the NB 4 /VEGF-C cells were cultured together with Etoposide (200ng/ml) for 48 hours, the numbers of AnnexinV + /PI \u2212 cells (apoptotic cells) were determined by FCM to investigate the effect of VEGF-C on the cells apoptosis and expression levels of antiapoptotic bcl-2 gene in these cells were analysed by RT-QPCR. The NB 4 /pcDNA3.1 cells was used as control during the experiments. From these experiments, NB 4 /VEGF-C cells can stably secret active protein VEGF-C in the cell supernatants. The cell growth curve shows that the proliferation ability of NB 4 /VEGF-C cells is stronger compared with NB 4 /pcDNA3.1cells. The expression levels of C/EBP \u03b1 gene of NB 4 /VEGF-C cells after induced by ATRA is only 1/32 that of NB 4 /pcDNA3.1 cells. Morphological analysis shows that the degree of promyelocytes gradually maturing into myelocytes among NB 4 /VEGF-C cells is weaker compared with the controls after induced by ATRA. After induced by Etoposide, the percent of apoptotic cells of NB 4 /VEGF-C cells (7.20\u00b12.52%) is significantly lower than that of NB 4 /pcDNA3.1 cells (16.07\u00b13.58%)( P =0.005) and the bcl-2 gene expression level of NB 4 /VEGF-C cells is 2.28 times more than that of NB 4 /pcDNA3.1 cells. The results implied that the VEGF-C via VEGFR-3 signaling pathway could promote the proliferation of NB 4 cells by autocrine pathway and inhibit the NB 4 cells differentiation and maturation and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis via upregulating bcl-2 gene expression. Thus, VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signaling loops might play an important role in disease progression and be potential therapeutic target for the treatment of leukemias."
