    "abstract_text": "Rationale \u03b1\u03b2T- cell depleted allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantations (allo-SCT) have so far been reported in haploidentical stem cell transplantations. First results have been promising with a good engraftment and low incidence of GVHD. However, high rates of life-threatening GVHD are still observed within the context of matched related (MRD) and unrelated (MUD) donors. Therefore we aimed to assess the feasibility of \u03b1\u03b2T-cell depletion in the context of MUD and MRD and aimed to establish a transplantation regimen for patients with MRD and MUD undergoing an \u03b1\u03b2T- cell depleted allo-SCT. Objective To test feasibility of the generation of \u03b1\u03b2T- cell depleted grafts from MRD and MUD and assess the engraftment in the context of different conditioning regimens after allo-SCT in patients with poor risk leukemia. Method Initial proof runs for the generation of \u03b1\u03b2T-cell and CD19 depleted grafts have been performed in 4 healthy donors. Grafts for transplantation of the first 5 patients (cohort I) have been depleted with GMP-grade anti-\u03b1\u03b2TCR and anti-CD19 antibodies. The subsequent grafts for patients in cohort II (n=4) and III (n=2) have been selectively depleted with GMP-grade anti-\u03b1\u03b2TCRs antibodies. Three conditioning regimens have been investigated (I): fludarabine 120 mg/m2 + cyclophosfamide 4800 mg/m2, (II): fludarabine 120 mg/m2 + busilvex AUC=90 and (III): ATG (Genzyme\u00ae) 4 mg/m2 + fludarabine 120 mg/m2 + busilvex AUC=90 followed by \u03b1\u03b2T- cell depleted grafts from matched related or unrelated donors. No additional immune suppression was given after allo-SCT. Main study parameters/endpoints: (1) Feasibility to generate an \u03b1\u03b2T-cell depleted graft form MRD and MUD. (2) Engraftment and reconstitution of T-cells within the context of different transplantation regimens. Results Products for 11 patients have been successfully processed and used for \u03b1\u03b2T-cell depleted allo-SCT between 2011 and 2013. A \u223c4 log depletion of \u03b1\u03b2T-cells has been observed in the product with a recovery of \u223c75% of CD34+ cells. In cohort I, primary engraftment (chimerism > 95%) was 40%. Engrafted patients showed a rapid reconstitution of \u03b3\u03b4T-cells and \u03b1\u03b2T-cells with a broad \u03b1\u03b2T-cell repertoire as determined by spectratyping. Therefore the next cohort was dose-intensified and the CD19-depletion omitted (cohort II). 75% of cohort II showed a swift engraftment. Again a dominance of \u03b3\u03b4T-cells was observed which associated with a rapidly reconstituting \u03b1\u03b2T-cell repertoire. Omitting CD19-depletion did not result in severe EBV-reactivations. One patient had an EBV reactivation under a short course of prednisone; however EBV was rapidly cleared after tapering steroids. In order to further increase engraftment cohort III was additionally treated with an early application of ATG (day -10/-9) and no graft failure has been observed so far. Conclusion \u03b1\u03b2T-cell depletion is feasible in the context of MRD and MUD. An intensified conditioning with additional host T-cell depletion seems to be beneficial for a profound engraftment. \u03b1\u03b2T-cell depletion associates with a swift and dominant reconstitution of \u03b3\u03b4T-cells as well as a rapidly restoring \u03b1\u03b2T-cell repertoire which is able to control viral re-activations.
