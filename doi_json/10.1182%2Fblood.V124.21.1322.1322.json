    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presents a significant economic burden to patients, health care insurers and society, and is expected to remain so in the near future. There are few studies describing the costs of AML in the literature. However, the high cost of treating AML and the demographic evolution of the world population, indicate that such studies are needed to support ongoing efforts to allocate resources efficiently in health care. OBJECTIVE: To describe and compare the costs of AML therapies daily used at the Antwerp University Hospital in adult patients receiving chemotherapy with/without stem cell transplantation and in patients receiving immunotherapy using dendritic cell vaccination. DESIGN AND METHODS: This monocentric study compares direct hospital medical costs of treatment for AML between 2005 and 2010, allocated and charged according to the hospital analytic accounting system. Information on use of medical resources was collected from electronic medical records. Professional and facility charges associated with inpatient and outpatient management were collected using electronic billing information. Drug costs and drug administration costs were based on list prices published by the Belgian reimbursement authority (RIZIV/INAMI). The cost analysis distinguished between group 1, patients treated with induction and consolidation therapy alone; group 2, patients treated with induction and consolidation therapy plus allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and group 3, patients treated with induction and consolidation therapy plus immunotherapy using dendritic cells engineered to express the Wilms\u2019 tumor protein (Van Tendeloo et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2010;107(31):13824-9). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 51 adult patients who were treated for newly diagnosed AML were included. Costs on medical and nursing care at the hematology ward, pharmaceutical prescriptions, transfer episodes to the intensive care ward, laboratory tests and medical imaging were analyzed. The cost of dendritic cell vaccine preparation was \u20ac 20 450 per patient. The median cost in group 1 (15 patients) was \u20ac 32,648 (range: \u20ac 4,759 - \u20ac 140,383). Only 1 patient in group 1 went into remission after induction therapy and received consolidation therapy. All patients in group 1 died within 5 year after diagnosis, 13 patients died within 1 year and 5 died within 1 month. The median cost in group 2 (26 patients) was \u20ac 184,554 (range: \u20ac 87,932 - \u20ac 449,155). The median post-consolidation treatment cost in group 2 was \u20ac 110,430 (range: \u20ac 31,364 - \u20ac 255,948). Five-year survival in group 2 was 19%. Seventeen patients in group 2 died within 1 year after HSCT. The median cost in group 3 (10 patients) was \u20ac 88,635 (range: \u20ac 23,392 - \u20ac 215,119). The median post-consolidation treatment cost in group 3 was \u20ac 40,748 (range: \u20ac 26,907- \u20ac 156,870). Five-year survival in group 3 was 30%. Four patients in group 3 died within 1 year after vaccination. CONCLUSION: This study comparing different post-consolidation therapies confirmes the high cost of treating AML and suggests that savings to the healthcare system could be achieved by sustaining complete remission status for longer periods. Dendritic cell vaccination is one of the new therapeutic options to attain a long remission status. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
