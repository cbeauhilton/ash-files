    "abstract_text": "Background The prognosis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL) has been greatly improved in the modern era of imatinib. Nevertheless, relapse is still a major cause of treatment failure in human Ph + ALL. Leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) are presumed to be responsible for relapse in leukemia. Therefore, we conducted a study to identify the candidate LICs that are responsible for disease progression and its clinical significance in patients with Ph + ALL. Aims To investigate the leukemia-initiating and self-renewal capacities of CD34 + CD38 - CD58 - cells and determine the prognostic significance of CD34 + CD38 - CD58 - phenotype in patients with Ph + ALL treated in Peking University Institute of Hematology. Methods The leukemia-initiating potential and self-renewal capacity of the sorted CD34 + CD38 - CD58 - , CD34 + CD38 - CD58 + ,CD34 + CD38 + CD58 - and CD34 + CD38 + CD58 + compartments were investigated in vivo using sublethally irradiated and anti-mouse CD122 monoclonal antibody conditioned NOD/SCID mice by intra-bone marrow\u2013injection. Furthermore, we prospectively analyzed whether the identified CD34 + CD38 - CD58 - compartment at diagnosis correlates with minimal residual disease (MRD) after therapy and clinical outcomes in 63 adult patients (18-60 years) with de novo Ph + ALL. Results Xenotransplantation of the sorted CD34 + CD38 - CD58 - cells led to a repopulation of human B-ALL in primary and secondary recipient mice, which were phenotypically and clonally derived from the original Ph + ALL patients analyzed by flow cytometry, as well as quantitative real-time RT-PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization for leukemia-specific cytogenetic abnormalities. Furthermore, the candidate CD34 + CD38 - CD58 - LICs phenotype at diagnosis (n=16) significantly correlated with a lower complete remission rate and higher MRD frequency monitored by BCR-ABL mRNA levels in BM of Ph + ALL patients. Additionally, it directly correlated with higher cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR, 60% \u00b1 1.97% vs. 15.51% \u00b1 0.30%, P =0.002) and unfavorable disease-free survival (DFS, 33.75%\u00b112.64% vs. 71.31%\u00b17.17%, P =0.009) at 3-year. The CD34 + CD38 - CD58 - group exhibited a higher rate of BCR-ABL mutations conferring higher level imatinib resistance than the other group (43.75% vs. 17.02%, P =0.04). Multivariate analyses revealed that CD34 + CD38 - CD58 - phenotype at diagnosis was an independent risk factor for relapse (HR=4.35, P =0.009) and DFS (HR=3.38, P =0.008) in adult Ph + ALL. Summary/Conclusion Both the xenotransplantation data as well as the clinical correlation studies show that CD34 + CD38 - CD58 - compartment enrich for leukemia-initiating cells in adult Ph + ALL. CD34 + CD38 - CD58 - phenotype at diagnosis independently correlates with an adverse prognosis, which promises to be an efficient tool for relapse prediction and risk-stratification treatment in adult Ph + ALL patients.
