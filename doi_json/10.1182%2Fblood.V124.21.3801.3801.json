TP53 alteration in the context of telomere shortening (the hallmark of aging) results in telomere attrition and genomic instability with resultant overexpression of telomerase to overcome the genomic crisis. Objective To determine TP53 alteration frequency and its association with cytogenetic subgroups, key B cell differentiation/cell cycle genes abnormalities and induction therapy response in ALL patients aged \u226560 and its impact on leukemic telomere state Methods Patients enrolled in the UK NCRI UKALL14 and UKALL60+ trials aged \u226560 years were assessed at diagnosis for 17p deletions by cytogenetics, TP53 alterations by FISH and/or direct sequencing of hot spots exons 5-8. Data were correlated with IKZF1, CDKN2A/B, PAR1, BTG, RB1, ETV6, EBF and PAX5 gene copy number status, assessed by MLPA (P335-B1). MYC-rearrangement was an exclusion criterion. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) for Ig/TCR rearrangements or BCR-ABL1, where applicable. Leukemic DNA telomere length relative to that of remission DNA was assessed by monochrome multiplex (MM) qPCR and expressed as a log2 ratio. Using expectation maximization mixture model a log2 ratio >3.18 defined gain (reflecting telomerase overexpression) and values below this were defined as loss. Results The cohort included 63 patients; characteristics are presented in table 1. Median age was 63 years (range 60\u201383). TP53 state by cytogenetics and/or sequencing was available in all. Eleven had TP53 alteration (17%); TP53 mutation only, n=3; TP53 deletion only, n=6; TP53 deletion and mutation, n=2. Cytogenetics was available in 60 patients. Nine patients had HoTr (14%). Seven of 9 patients with HoTr had TP53 alteration (78%) versus 4/51 without HoTr (4%); p<0.001. MLPA was done in 57 patients. Those with TP53 alteration had more copy number alterations (CNA)(median 4 versus 1; p<0.01). Twelve (21%) had RB1 deletion; 3 were due to cytogenetically visible 13q abnormalities rather than \u0091true' intragenic aberration. Four of 9 patients with TP53 alteration had RB1 deletion versus 8/51 without TP53 alteration, p=0.07. All other microaberrations were not significantly associated with TP53 alteration. Sixty-two achieved complete remission after 2 cycles of induction. MRD state (n=32) was not impacted by TP53 (2/5 with TP53 alteration and 13/27 without were MRD positive after 2 cycles of induction; p=0.563). Fourteen of 59 (24%) patients relapsed; median of four months from diagnosis (range 2\u201321), three had TP53 alteration versus 11 without TP53 alteration; p=0.65. Relapse occurred significantly earlier in patients with TP53 alteration (median two months versus eight months; p=0.03). Leukemic telomere state was assessed in 28 patients. Three of 4 patients with telomere gain had TP53 alteration versus 3/24 without; p=0.02 Conclusions This is one of the largest reports of TP53 frequency in older patients with non-MYC-rearranged ALL. TP53 was deleted and/or mutated in 17%, with highest frequency in those with HoTr (7/9). RB1 deletion was the commonest associated microaberration, noted in over a third of patients. TP53 alteration was associated with earlier relapse but had no impact on induction response. TP53 alteration was notably associated with frequent CNA and telomere gain suggesting a putative potential role of TP53 in genomic instability though sample size for the latter limits assertion of this hypothesis. Mechanistic work to shed insight into this model is currently underway. Table 1: Patient characteristics  . TP53 deleted and/or mutated n=11 . TP53 wild type n=52 .
