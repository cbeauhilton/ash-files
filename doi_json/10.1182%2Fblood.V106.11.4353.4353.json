    "abstract_text": "Activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway by the HTLV-I oncoprotein Tax plays a mandatory role in the proliferation and transformation of infected T cells. We have previously demonstrated that Tax is ubiquitylated, mostly on lysine residues located in its carboxy-terminal half. In this study, we investigated the contribution of Tax ubiquitylation on its ability to transactivate the NF-\u03baB pathway. We show that the integrity of C-terminal lysines, and Tax ubiquitylation, are critical for Tax binding to IKK, IKK activation and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB. We also report that Tax is post-translationally modified by SUMO on lysine residues also targeted by ubiquitin and that Tax sumoylation occurs in the nucleus and is required for the terminal steps of NF-\u03baB activation. Conversely, Tax ubiquitylation and sumoylation are not involved in CREB activation. Thus, the differential ubiquitylation or sumoylation of the same lysines in Tax regulates essential events controlling the NF-\u03baB pathway, revealing how distinct cellular modifications enrich the functions of this versatile oncoprotein.",
