    "abstract_text": "Gene expression profiling has shown that diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) clusters into three major subtypes based on similarity in expression patterns to their cell of origin (COO): germinal center B-cell-like (GCB-DLBCL), activated B-cell-like DLBCL (ABC-DBLCL) and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). These subtypes of DLBCLs are associated with distinctly different overall survival rates after standard immunochemotherapy. However, clinical and prognostic heterogeneity remains within COO subsets and strategies are needed to further stratify patients to identify and target high-risk subsets. A comprehensive genomic analysis of COO on a clinically defined set of DLBCL cases has not been performed and the aim of this study was to use whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from 58 paired tumor-normal DLBCL samples to assess association of known DLBCL genomic alterations with cell COO as well as for identification of novel and relevant genetic biomarkers. To investigate genomic alterations associated with DLBCL subsets, we analyzed WES and genome wide copy number data from 58 paired tumor-normal DLBCL tumors. Gene expression profiling or Hans classification was performed to determine DLBCL COO subtype; 31 patients were classified as GCB and 27 as non-GCB. The WES data were used to 1) assess the association of known DLBCL genomic alterations with COO, and 2) identify novel alternations associated with COO. Statistical analysis was performed and the data were ranked by significance (p\u2264 0.05) within each DLBCL subtype. In total, 45 genomic abnormalities were analyzed for their association with either GCB, non-GCB or both. Mutations in CREBBP , EZH2 , MEF2B , FOXO1 and REL have also been reported as GCB driver mutations and we observed GCB patients with these mutations, but the mutation clustering was not wholly associated with GCB. MYC double-hits were exclusively found in the GCB-subtype group. For the non-GCB cases we found that mutations in MAP2K3 and MYD88 were significantly associated with this subtype( p < 0.05). In addition to mutational patterns, we identified several copy number alterations (CNA) across both groups. Chromosomal losses in GCB patients were found at chromosomes 10q11.21-10q24.23, 4q12-4q35.2, 3q12.1-3q29, 4p12-4p16.3, 10p11.21-10p15.3, and 14q11.2-14q24.3 whereas gains were localized to 7q11.1-7q36.3, 7p11.2-7p22.3, and 1q21-1q32.1 ( p < 0.05). No CNA was observed to directly associate with non-GCB patients, however, a loss at 9p21 and gains at 9q24.1 and 18q21.33 trended with the non-GCB subtype, supporting previous reports. Loss at 10q23.31 or a gain in 2p13-2p12 have been reported as being specific for GCB and our data confirmed the association of 10q23.31 with GCB while a gain at 2p13-2p12 ( REL) was found in both subtypes. To further understand genomic differences between DLBCL subtypes, we evaluated the relative percentage of each genomic feature. 18/45 (40%) were only observed in GCB patients whereas 2/45 (5%) were specific to the non-GCB subtype. The majority (25/45, 55%) overlapped between the two subtypes. Throughout our analysis we noted that 7 non-GCB cases lacked any of the driver mutations analyzed in the study. While all cases carried mutations, they consisted of low frequency mutations that were not specifically associated with COO. 2/7 cases had a gain at 9p24.1 that included CD274 and JAK2 . Because 9p24.1 gains have not been fully defined in DLBCL, we reviewed all cases and identified 4 (7%) with a 9p24.1 gain, 3 of which were non-GCB and 1 GCB. One non-GCB case was EBV+ and none of the cases showed evidence of PMBCL. Of the 9p24.1 cases, three had RNAseq data available and we found that PDL1 and JAK2 expression was elevated (12 fold p < 0.01 and 7 fold p < 0.01, respectively) when compared to the 9p24.1 normal cases (n=32). While outcome was not the focus of the study, we did note that 6/7 cases that lacked driver mutations achieved event free survival at 24 months (EFS24). Taken together, this analysis has further characterized the genetic profile of each COO subtype and has identified novel GCB CNAs which require independent replication. Additionally, we identify a subgroup of non-GCB DLBCL patients that do not harbor known driver mutations and require further genomic study to better resolve the biology of these tumors. Together, these data provide insight on the genetic heterogeneity of DLBCL and identify genetic variants that may inform subtype specific therapy.
