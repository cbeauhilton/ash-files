    "abstract_text": "Pharmacological or genetic induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, \u03b12\u03b32) in adult red blood cells is a proven strategy to ameliorate the clinical symptoms of sickle cell disease (SCD) and \u03b2-thalassemia. Therefore, efforts are underway to better understand mechanisms that mediate the perinatal switch from HbF to adult hemoglobin (HbA, \u03b12\u03b22). We performed a CRISPR-Cas9/guide (g) RNA screen to identify novel proteins that regulate HbF production in HUDEP-2 cells, a human erythroid line that normally expresses HbA. We identified UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains 1) as a repressor of HbF production. UHRF1 binds hemi-methylated DNA and recruit DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) to ensure faithful maintenance of DNA methylation during DNA replication. Numerous UHRF1-interacting proteins, including DNMT1, EHMT1/2 and HDAC2 are associated with \u03b3-globin repression. We used CRISPR/Cas9 and RNA interference to validate UHRF1 as a HbF regulator. Compared to non-targeting gRNA UHRF1 disruption using Cas9 + 2 separate gRNAs increased the \u03b3-globin/\u03b3+\u03b2-globin RNA ratio from 1.9 to 25.8/27.1% (P<0.01), increased the fraction of HbF immunostaining cells (\"F-cells\") from 7.5 to 25.1/35.4% and increased HbF protein from 2.10 to 16.3/15.0% (P<0.01) in HUDEP-2 cells. Compared to a control luciferase shRNA, 2 different UHRF1 shRNAs increased the\u03b3-globin/\u03b3+\u03b2-globin RNA ratio from 9.68% to 21.59/28.93% (P<0.01), increased the F-cell fraction from 37.9 to 49.8/55.6% and increased HbF protein from 9.1 to 16.18/18.5% (P<0.05) in erythroid cells derived from normal adult peripheral blood CD34 + cells. UHRF1 deficiency did not alter erythroid maturation or expression of key transcription factor genes that regulate HbF expression in HUDEP-2 or CD34 + cells ( BCL11A , ZBTB7A , MYB and KLF1) . UHRF1 mutant proteins defective in recognizing H3K9me2 (FW237/238AA), binding to hemi-methylated DNA (R491A) or ubiquitination of H3K23 to enhance DNMT1 recruitment (C741A), were unable to repress HBG1/HBG2 . These mutations have the most profound effects on maintaining DNA methylation, indicating that UHRF1 represses HBG1/HBG2 in HUDEP-2 cells through this mechanism. UHRF1 knockout induced genome-wide demethylation including 6 CpG sites located at positions -162, -53, -50, +6, +17, +50 positions relative to the \u03b3-globin ( HBG1 and HBG2) transcription start site. Demethylation of these sites is thought to be required for \u03b3-globin de-repression. However, forced demethylation of these cytosines in HUDEP-2 cells using specific gRNAs + dead (d) Cas9-TET1 was not sufficient to activate \u03b3-globin expression when UHRF1 was present. Additionally, dCas9-DNMT3a-mediated methylation of the HBG promoter CpG residues in UHRF1 knockdown HUDEP-2 cells did not inhibit \u03b3-globin expression in UHRF1 knockout HUDEP-2 cells. Based on these studies, we conclude that: 1) UHRF1 regulates \u03b3-globin transcription; 2) demethylation of CpG sites at the HBG gene promoters is neither necessary or sufficient for \u03b3-globin induction; 3) UHRF1 regulates \u03b3-to-\u03b2 globin gene switching either by methylating DNA regions other than those present around the HBG promoter or through non-canonical activities. Distinguishing these mechanisms will elucidate further our understanding of globin gene switching and could identify new pathways for pharmacological induction of HbF.
