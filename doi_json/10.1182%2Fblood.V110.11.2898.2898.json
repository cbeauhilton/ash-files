    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: In addition to the common ABO phenotypes, numerous phenotypes with a weak expression of the A or B antigens on red blood cells have been found. DNA genotyping on A 3 e A 3 B subgroups has been performed in small number of samples, mainly in family studies. To date, seven ABO alleles have been associated to A 3 and A 3 B subgroups ( ABO*A301 to ABO*A307 ) revealing molecular heterogeneity. Our purpose was to study molecular events on exon 7 of ABO gene in 100 A 3 and A 3 B blood donors samples. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: ABO serologic analyses of 12,283 blood donors of blood groups A and AB allowed the detection of 13 A 3 and 87 A 3 B samples. Initially, DNA amplification was performed using sequence specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP) to identify 467C>T, 829G>A, 871G>A and 1060delC polimorphisms of exon 7 of ABO gene, followed by direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: New ABO variants were detected in 5/13 (38.5%) of A 3 and in 38/87 (43.7%) of A 3 B samples. ABO* A302/ABO*A301 genotype was found in 30.7% A 3 and, ABO* A302/ABO*B104 in 17.1% of A 3 B samples. The 871G>A mutation previously reported only in A 3 B individuals was found in 9 blood samples tested as A 3 in our study. For the first time, mutations between 441\u2013450 nucleotides of exon 7 of ABO gene was detected in 39 samples (single nucleotide polimorphisms and deletions) of A 3 and A 3 B subgroups. CONCLUSION: This is the first large molecular study of A 3 and A 3 B samples. Sistematic analysis of A 3 and A 3 B samples reveals new ABO variants caused by different molecular events. Mutations between 441 and 450 nt. of exon 7 are critical for transferase A expression in individuals typed as A 3 and A 3 B.",
