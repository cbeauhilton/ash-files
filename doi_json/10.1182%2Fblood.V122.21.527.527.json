    "abstract_text": "Background Mutations in NOTCH1 ( NOTCH1 mut ) have been found in CLL with an incidence of about 10% and have been associated with unmutated IGHV , +12q, and poor outcome in previous studies. In the CLL8 trial (1 st line FCR vs. FC), NOTCH1 mut was identified as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for progression free survival (PFS) and a predictive factor for reduced benefit from the addition of Rituximab to FC. Methods We assessed the incidence and impact of NOTCH1 mut in the OMB110911 trial (1 st line Chl vs. O-Chl) in patients considered inappropriate for fludarabine-based therapy. Pretreatment samples were available from 376 patients (84.1%) and this cohort was representative for the full trial population. The mutation hotspot fragment (chr9:139,390,619-139,390,840) of exon 34 of NOTCH1 was analyzed by Sanger sequencing and by NGS using Illumina MiSeq. NGS was used to evaluate the sensitivity of Sanger sequencing to detect c.7541_7542delCT mutation and to determine the exact variant frequency of the mutant allele. Results The c.7541_7542delCT mutation was found by Sanger sequencing and by NGS in 45 (12.0%) of 376 patients (24 in O-Chl and 21 in Chl). When comparing baseline characteristics, there were significant associations of NOTCH1 mut with +12q (p=0.01), absence of 13q- (p=0.006) and unmutated IGHV (p=0.009), but not with gender, age , Binet stage, ECOG, CIRS, B symptoms, WBC, \u00df2-MG, 6q-, 11q-, and 17p-. Regarding response to treatment, there was no association between NOTCH1 mut and ORR or CR, neither in the whole group nor when analyzing the treatment arms separately. At a median follow-up of 29.0 months for PFS there were 249 events, at the medium follow-up of 31.7 months for OS 63 events in the 376 patient cohort. Similar to the full trial cohort, also in our cohort, O-Chl as compared to Chl resulted into significant improved PFS (median 22.4 vs. 13.1 months, HR=0.54, p<0.001). Of note, NOTCH1 mut was associated with shorter PFS in the O-Chl arm (17.7 vs. 23.3, HR 1.86 p=0.01) but did not affect PFS in the Chl arm (10.3 vs. 13.3 months, HR 1.20 p=0.49). Correspondingly, in cases without NOTCH1 mut a benefit from the addition of Ofatumumab was evident (HR 0.501 p<0.001) while for NOTCH1 mut patients a reduced benefit which did not meet statistical significance was observed (HR 0.734 p=0.35). To identify factors of independent clinical impact, we performed multivariable Cox regressions for PFS and OS including the following variables: treatment, gender, age, Binet stage, ECOG status, CIRS, B symptoms, WBC, \u00df2-MG, 11q, 17p, IGHV and NOTCH1 . For PFS, the following independent prognostic factors were identified: O-Chl (HR 0.39, p 50Gl/l (HR 2.66, p8 (HR 1.70 p<0.001), male gender (HR 1.39 p=0.04), unmutated IGHV (HR 1.38 p=0.04), 17p- (HR 3.19 p<0.001) and NOTCH1 mut (HR 1.47 p=0.05). Regarding OS, WBC > 50Gl/l (HR 2.58 p=0.01), \u00df2-MG > 5mg/l (HR 2.55 p=0.004), Binet Stage C (HR 2.13 p=0.01), 17p- (HR 4.97 p=0.001) and unmutated IGHV (HR 1.91 p=0.04) were identified as independent prognostic factors. Most likely due to the low frequency of NOTCH1 mut of 12%, an interaction term in the multivariable model failed to achieve significance (HR 1.49, p=0.27). When comparing NGS and Sanger sequencing, all cases with a mutant allele burden of >5% were detected by Sanger sequencing and in 34 of 45 NOTCH1 mut patients, the hotspot mutation could be identified in a fraction >20%. For this subgroup, the effect of NOTCH1 mut on PFS in the O-Chl treatment arm was even more pronounced (O-Chl: HR 2.459, p<0.01). Conclusion In the OMB110911 trial evaluating 1 st line O-Chl against Chl, NOTCH1 mut was associated with absence of 13q-, +12q, unmutated IGHV and a shorter PFS in multivariable analysis. Comparison of the impact of NOTCH1 mut in both treatment arms suggests NOTCH1 mut is a predictive marker for reduced benefit from the addition of Ofatumumab in the O-Chl treatment arm.
