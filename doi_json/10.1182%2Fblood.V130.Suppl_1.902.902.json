    "abstract_text": "Background There is increasing evidence for the clinical benefit of long-term, continuous therapy for NDMM pts. Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) form a backbone of therapy in MM; however, long-term therapy with some PIs may be limited due to toxicity and the need for regular parenteral administration, increasing the treatment burden. Ixazomib, the first oral PI, has been studied in NDMM pts in 4 phase 1/2 studies in which approximately 1 year of induction therapy with once- or twice-weekly ixazomib plus lenalidomide-dexamethasone (IRd), melphalan-prednisone (IMP), or cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone (ICd) was followed by single-agent ixazomib maintenance. Here we report an integrated analysis of pts from these studies who did not undergo autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and received ixazomib maintenance therapy. Methods Pts from 4 studies were included: 1) weekly IRd, 12x28-d cycles IRd (weekly ixazomib 1.68-3.95 mg/m\u00b2 in phase 1, recommended phase 2 dose [RP2D] 4.0 mg; C16005, NCT01217957; ASCT-eligible/-ineligible pts); 2) twice-weekly IRd, 16x21-d cycles IRd (twice-weekly ixazomib 3.0-3.7 mg in phase 1, RP2D 3.0 mg; C16008, NCT01383928; ASCT-eligible/-ineligible pts); 3) IMP, 9x42-d or 13x28-d cycles IMP (weekly/twice-weekly ixazomib 3.0-5.5/3.0-3.7 mg in phase 1, RP2D of weekly ixazomib 4.0 mg; C16006, NCT01335685; ASCT-ineligible pts); 4) ICd, 13x28-d cycles ICd (weekly ixazomib 4.0 mg; C16020, NCT02046070; ASCT-ineligible pts). In all 4 studies, pts completing induction without progressive disease (PD) and, in the IRd studies, not withdrawn for ASCT, could receive single-agent ixazomib maintenance at the last tolerated dose during induction until PD or unacceptable toxicity. Results 121 pts received ixazomib maintenance (25, 18, 35, and 43 in weekly IRd, twice-weekly IRd, IMP, and ICd studies, respectively). Median age was 72 yrs (range 34-90 yrs; 83% aged \u226565 yrs), 62% had IgG myeloma, 47/34/19% had ISS disease stage I/II/III, 40/49% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1. Combined median progression-free survival (PFS) was 33.8 months from time of study entry and 21.4 months from start of maintenance (Figure). Median PFS from the start of maintenance seemed to be longer for the two IRd studies than for IMP, while median PFS for ICd had not yet been reached. 4-yr OS from time of study entry/3-yr OS from the start of maintenance was 82%. Overall response rate was 93% after induction and 94% after maintenance. Best response rate of CR+VGPR after induction was 57% (22% CR), which increased to 63% (35% CR/sCR) after maintenance; 24 pts (20%) improved their response during maintenance (4 pts with CR improved to sCR; 14 VGPR to CR/sCR; 5 partial response [PR] to VGPR/CR; 1 stable disease to PR). Combined mean dose intensity during maintenance was 89.1%. At time of analysis, median duration of maintenance therapy was 2.2 yrs for weekly IRd, 1.0 yr for twice-weekly IRd, and 0.9 yr for IMP and ICd; maximum duration was 4.8, 3.8, 3.9, and 1.6 yrs respectively. 78% of pts had discontinued maintenance, primarily due to PD (55%), and only 7% due to adverse events (AEs). 15% of pts had ixazomib dose reductions during maintenance. Grade \u22653 AEs (48% vs 74%), drug-related grade \u22653 AEs (24% vs 62%), serious AEs (SAEs; 21% vs 43%), and drug-related SAEs (5% vs 19%) were less common during maintenance than during induction. Common grade \u22653 AEs are shown in the Table. Other AEs of clinical interest were also generally similar or less common during maintenance than during induction, including cardiac arrhythmias (13% vs 21%), pneumonia (12% vs 17%), acute renal failure (7% vs 8%), hypotension (4% vs 7%), myocardial infarction (0 vs <1%), and heart failure (2% vs 2%). Only 6 pts (5%) reported a new primary malignancy. There was only 1 on-study death during maintenance, which was not considered related to ixazomib; due to pulmonary edema in an 81-yr old pt with a history of cardiovascular co-morbidities. Conclusions In this integrated analysis, single-agent ixazomib maintenance therapy following an ixazomib-based induction regimen was associated with deepening of responses and good long-term outcomes in NDMM pts not undergoing ASCT. Single-agent ixazomib is feasible for long-term administration, with limited new-onset grade \u22653 AEs. These outcomes appear similar to other studies involving maintenance approaches in NDMM and support the ongoing phase 3 investigation of ixazomib maintenance therapy.
