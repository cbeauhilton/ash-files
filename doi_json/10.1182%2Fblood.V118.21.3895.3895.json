    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3895 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells depend on their microenvironment for proliferation and survival. Ectonucleotidase CD39 has anti-inflammatory properties as it hydrolyzes pro-inflammatory extra-cellular ATP, generates anti-inflammatory adenosine and also protects regulatory T cells from ATP-induced cell death. In this study we investigated the clinical significance of CD39 expression on CD4 + T-cells in 45 patients with CLL as well as its compartmental regulation and explored the possible mechanisms for its induction. Compared to healthy individuals, CD4 + CD39 + lymphocytes were increased in the peripheral blood of patients with CLL (4.6%\u00b12.28 vs. 17.3%\u00b112.49, respectively, p=0.004), and correlated with advanced stage of disease (9.72%\u00b15.76, 18.15%\u00b112.03 and 25.90%\u00b116.34, of CD4 + lymphocytes, in patients with Rai stages 0, 1+2 and 3+4, respectively, p=0.019). CD4 + CD39 + cells were also higher in patients with CLL who needed therapeutic intervention (untreated; 12.99%\u00b110.63 vs treated; 22.21%\u00b112.88, p=0.01) and in those who were ZAP70 + or had b2-microglobulin levels>3g/L. There were more CD4 + CD39 + lymphocytes in the bone marrow compartment (22.25%\u00b116.16) than in the peripheral blood (16.60%\u00b115.84, p=0.009). In-vitro studies showed that CD39 can be induced on CD4 + cells by exposure to ATP or indirectly, following B-cell receptor (BCR) engagement (CD4 + CD39 + lymphocytes increased by 1.56 fold, in the BCR engaged samples compared to their paired controls; 20.27%\u00b111.3 vs. 13%\u00b19.42, respectively, p=0.0006). Conclusions: Increased CD39 expression on CD4+ T-lymphocytes in CLL associates with an aggressive disease. This may reflect the ability of the leukemic cells to suppress the surrounding immune environment, and contribute to a poorer prognosis. CD39 + may also serve as a future target for the development of novel therapies with immune modulating anti\u2013tumor agents in CLL. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
