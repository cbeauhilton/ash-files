    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2954 Poster Board II-930 The deleted in liver cancer-1 (DLC-1) gene encodes a Rho GTPase activating protein (RhoGAP) with potential tumor-suppressor activity. Hypermethylation in the DLC-1 promoter is an aberrant epigenetic modification associated with transcriptional silencing of DLC-1 in various types of human cancers. To explore the epigenetic alteration of DLC-1 in Waldenstro\u0308m's macroglobulinemia (WM), we investigated the methylation status of the DLC-1 promoter and its correlation with DLC-1 mRNA expression in cell lines and primary WM patient samples. Initial analysis using methylation-specific PCR (MSP) showed that DLC-1 promoter was completely methylated in WM-WSU and partially methylated in BCWM.1. Using quantitative RT-PCR, DLC-1 mRNA expression was detectable in BCWM.1, but not WM-WSU. These results suggested a correlation between the DLC-1 methylation status and mRNA expression. Similarly, among multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines, we showed that RPMI and U266 exhibited complete methylation, whereas INA6 showed partial methylation, and no methylation was detectable in MM1S and MM1R cells. Similar in WM cells, DLC-1 methylation status was highly correlated with the mRNA expression in these MM cell lines. Of 37 WM patient samples examined, 24 (65%) exhibited methylation in the DLC-1 promoter. In contrast, no methylation of DLC-1 was observed in 4 healthy volunteers. The methylation status was further confirmed using bisulfite DNA sequencing in a subset of WM patients. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that DLC-1 mRNA expression was significantly lower in WM patients compared to healthy volunteers ( p =0.001). Treatment with demethylation agents azacytidine or 5-aza-deoxycytidine resulted in significant reactivation of DLC-1 transcription in the WM cell lines WM-WSU and BCWM.1. In addition, a synergistic induction of DLC-1 transcription was observed in the presence of azacytidine and the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat in BCWM.1 and primary WM patient cells. Moreover, functional studies showed that overexpression of DLC-1 induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis in BCWM.1. DLC-1 methylation status was also correlated with serum sCD27 levels in WM patients ( p =0.004), which is secreted by WM cells, serves as a marker of disease burden and facilitates CD40L directed paracrine stimulation by mast cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the down-regulation of DLC-1 via aberrant DNA methylation plays a role in the pathogenesis of WM, and represents a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of WM.
