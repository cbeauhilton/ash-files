    "abstract_text": "Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the accumulation of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow. D-type cyclins (CCNDs), an important family of cell cycle regulators, are thought to be implicated in multiple myeloma (MM) development because CCNDs are commonly expressed in myeloma cells. CCND is known to positively regulate the cell cycle from G1 to S-phase initiation by binding to cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6, resulting in potentiation of myeloma cell growth. These findings suggest a possible role for CDK4/6-targeting therapy in MM, yet the details remain incompletely understood. In this regard, we investigated the biological activity of abemaciclib, a potent, highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor, in myeloma cell lines, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the involvement of the CCND-CDK4/6 complex in cell cycle regulation and survival. Methods: The effects of abemaciclib on myeloma cells were investigated using three myeloma cell lines, KMS12-PE (CCND1-positive and CCND2-negative), RPMI8226 (CCND1-negative and CCND2-positive), and IM-9 (both CCND1- and CCND2-positive). Cell growth was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay. Cell cycle analysis was performed using propidium iodide (PI) and apoptosis was measured using annexin V/PI staining via flow cytometry. Cell cycle regulated proteins, including p21 and p27, and phosphorylated proteins, including STAT1, STAT3, ERK, JNK, p38, and AKT, were evaluated using a phospho-flow method. Autophagy was assessed using CYTO-ID via flow cytometry. PARP cleavage was investigated via western blotting. Clarithromycin, an antibiotic agent belonging to the macrolide class, was used as an autophagy inhibitor. Results: Abemaciclib inhibited myeloma cell growth in a dose-dependent manner in all the cell lines evaluated, with significant differences seen at a concentration of 320 nM. Annexin V/PI staining revealed that 1 \u03bcM abemaciclib showed little or no effect on apoptosis, but 3.2 \u03bcM abemaciclib induced apparent myeloma cell apoptosis, with an increase in both the early and late apoptotic fractions. Therefore, 1 and 3.2 \u03bcM of abemaciclib were used in subsequent experiments for the assessment of cell growth and apoptosis, respectively. Cell cycle analyses revealed that 1 \u03bcM abemaciclib increased the fraction of cells in G0/G1 phase and decreased the fraction in S-G2/M phase. Furthermore, this effect was associated with the upregulation of p21 and p27 in the evaluated myeloma cells. PARP cleavage was observed in KMS12-PE cells treated with 3.2 \u03bcM abemaciclib, but not 1 \u03bcM, suggesting a close connection between the degree of PARP cleavage and apoptosis in myeloma cells. Importantly, abemaciclib induced autophagy in a dose-dependent manner. However, no apparent inhibitory effect on the autophagy-related phosphorylated proteins STAT1 (Y701), STAT3 (Y705), ERK (T202/Y204), JNK (T183/Y185), p38 (T180/Y182), or AKT (Y315) was observed in myeloma cells treated with 3.2 \u03bcM abemaciclib. To investigate the role of abemaciclib-induced autophagy on myeloma cell apoptosis, we further assessed the apoptotic effect of 3.2 \u03bcM abemaciclib or 50 \u03bcg/mL clarithromycin, alone or in combination. Clarithromycin did not induce apoptosis of myeloma cells. Importantly, clarithromycin treatment in combination with abemaciclib attenuated the apoptotic effect of abemaciclib. Discussion & Conclusions: Although the underlying mechanisms conferring the level of CCND expression are known to differ greatly (e.g., CCND translocation, hyperdiploidy, or activation of upstream pathways of CCND transcription), the results of the current study indicate that the CCND-CDK4/6 complex is closely involved in myeloma cell growth and survival regardless of the CCND family member present. In addition, we demonstrate that abemaciclib exerts multiple effects, such as myeloma cell apoptosis, via the PARP pathway or autophagy, as well as cell cycle regulation. Because abemaciclib in combination with clarithromycin inhibits myeloma cell apoptosis, the autophagy induced by abemaciclib is considered to have a critical role in the induction of apoptosis, so-called \"autophagic cell death.\" These results provide novel insights into a possible therapeutic approach using abemaciclib to target CDK4/6 in patients with MM, and offer new possibilities for combination therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors and autophagy regulators.
