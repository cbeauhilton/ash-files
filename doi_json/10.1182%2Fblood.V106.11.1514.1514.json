    "abstract_text": "Patients with B-NHL respond initially to conventional chemotherapy and/or to immunotherapy with rituximab (alone or in combination with chemotherapy). However, patients develop resistance to these modalities and novel approaches are needed. TRAIL is a cytotoxic molecule that exerts selective anti-tumor cytotoxic activity with minimal toxicity to normal tissues. Further, TRAIL or agonist monoclonal antibody (mAb) to TRAIL receptors, DR4 and DR5, are currently being tested clinically. The present study investigated the sensitivity of B-NHL cell lines to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis using the AIDS-related NHL (ARL) B-cell line, 2F7, and the B-NHL cell lines, Ramos and Daudi. Also, to recapitulate various aspects of acquired rituximab-resistance, we have generated rituximab-resistant (RR) clones from the parental wild type (wt) cells. Rituximab failed to chemo-sensitize the RR clones and the clones exhibited higher resistance to various drugs (e.g., CDDP, VP-16, ADR, Vincristine, Taxol) and to TRAIL (1\u2013250 ng/ml-18 h) compared to the wt cells as analyzed by DNA fragment on assay. The findings demonstrate that the wild type and RR1 cells were resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis at a wide range of TRAIL concentrations. We then examined means to reverse TRAIL resistance. We and others have reported that inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity can sensitize TRAIL-resistant tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Hence, we examined the effect of the proteasome and NF-\u03baB inhibitor, Bortezomib (Velcade), Bay 11\u20137085 and the specific NF-\u03baB inhibitor DHMEQ ( Kikuchi et. al, Cancer Research  2003 ; 63 : 107 ). Pretreatment of the NHL tumor cells with Bortezomib, Bay 11\u20137085 or DHMEQ for 6 h followed by treatment with TRAIL for 18h resulted in significant augmentation of apoptosis and synergy was achieved. Both the rituximab-sensitive and rituximab-resistant tumor cells were sensitized by these inhibitors, though higher concentrations were required for sensitization of the RR clones. Interestingly, detailed analysis of the signaling pathways in the RR clones revealed constitutive hyper-activation of the NF-\u03baB survival pathway leading to over-expression of anti-apoptotic gene products Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. Based on the findings, we postulate that patients with resistant B-NHL can be treated with combination of TRAIL/anti-DR4 or DR5 mAb and NF-\u03baB inhibitors. Alternatively, these patients can be treated with agents that up-regulate TRAIL expression on host effectors (e.g., T cells, NK cells) in combination with NF-\u03baB inhibitors.",
