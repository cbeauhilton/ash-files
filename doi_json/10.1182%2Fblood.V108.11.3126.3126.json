    "abstract_text": "Regulatory cells may have a modulatory effect on alloreactive phenomena following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), although their role in this setting in patients remains controversial. We have analysed the effect of pre-conditioning peripheral blood levels of T-regs on the outcome of 89 adult patients undergoing HLA-identical (10/10) unrelated donor (UD)-HSCT. Allografts were T-cell depleted with Alemtuzumab, which has been described to spare T-regs from, and we found that higher proportion of CD4+CD25hi T-cells correlated with worse survival (p=0.002). This higher proportion also correlated with higher incidence of relapse (p=0.0274) and with higher incidence of chronic (c) GvHD (p=0.033) but not with the incidence of aGvHD. Regulatory T cells (T-regs) are a naturally occurring regulatory population of CD4 + CD25 hi T-cells known to express the transcription repressor FoxP3 and to produce anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF\u03b2 and may therefore affect patient survival. We analyse the profile of the CD4 + CD25 hi T cells in our cohort. In our healthy donor control group (n=30), CD4 + CD25 hi -expression associated with both, FoxP3 mRNA-levels (r=0.649; p=0.001) and TGF\u03b2 production (r=0.912; p<0.001), as previously described for T-regs. In preconditioning patient samples however, CD4+CD25hi-expression had a strong correlation with TGF\u03b2 regulatory cytokine production (r=0.863; p<0.001) as expected. However, FoxP3 mRNA-expression correlated neither with the CD4+CD25hi T-regs phenotype (r=0.280; p=0.040), nor with the production of TGF\u03b2 (r=0.229; p=0.156), and appeared not be an accurate marker for regulatory T-cell function in this patient setting. In addition, an inverse correlation with TNF\u03b1 expression (r=\u22120.458 p<0.001) was found that may argue that the CD4 + CD25 hi cells represent a true regulatory population and not activated cells. This suggests either that activated cells that are not expressing FOXP3 might be included in the CD4 + CD25 hi population or that CD4 + CD25 lo FOXP3 + cells have not acquire the regulatory function (i.e. they are not expressing TGF\u03b2). In summary, CD4 + CD25 hi Regulatory T cells may have an impact suppressing allo-responses against the tumour, decreasing the overall survival by increasing the rates of relapse. Although, in mice CD4 + CD25 hi population have been clearly identified by the expression of the FOXP3, which encodes a transcription repressor, in humans this remains controversial, where FOXP3 expression is not exclusive of the CD4 + CD25 hi population. Relying on the expression of CD4 + CD25 hi and FOXP3 in patients is insufficient to determine regulatory T cell numbers and suggests that other parameters of regulatory function should be taken in to account.",
