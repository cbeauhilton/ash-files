    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3854 Increasing age is a well-recognised risk factor for thrombotic events in patients with Essential Thrombocythemia (ET): however, few data exist on the role of other clinical and biological features in different age groups. To address this issue, we analysed retrospectively 1090 ET patients (M/F 403/687, median age 63 years, IR 17 \u2013 96) diagnosed at 11 Hematological Institutions in the Lazio region from 1980 to 2010 and with a median period of follow-up of 84 months (IR 1 \u2013 371). Based on the commonly adopted age threshold, 480 patients (44 %) were < 60 years (Group A) and 610 (56 %) were \u2265 60 years (Group B). Clinical and biological features as well as cardiovascular risk factors analyzed for the impact on the thrombotic risk in the two age groups are reported in the Table .  . Group A < 60 years .

In Group B, 63 patients (10.3%) had at least one thrombotic event during follow-up; there were 38 (69.4%) arterial thromboses and 25 (39.6%) venous thromboses. In group A univariate analysis for thrombosis-free survival performed by Kaplan-Meier method, disclosed a significant impact of male gender (p=0.0029, CI 1.03\u20136.94, HR 2.68), > 2 cardiovascular risk factors (p=0.0002, CI 1.87 \u2013 190, HR 18.94) and isolated hyperlipidemia (p=0.039, CI 0.917 \u2013 10.59, HR 3.11), while previous thrombotic events had no significant impact (p=0.27). By contrast, the presence of a previous thrombotic event was the only feature with a significant impact on thrombotic risk in Group B (p=0.0004, CI 1.38 \u2013 6.55, HR 3.01). WBC and PLTS values at different cut-off levels as well as JAK-2 mutational status did not have any impact on thrombosis in either age groups. However, in group B, we observed a trend (p=0.052, CI 0.28\u20130.99, HR 0.52) towards a protective effect of higher PLTS values (> 800 \u00d7 10 9 /l). In conclusion, our data seem to reinforce the need of a different thrombotic risk assessment in distinct age groups: in particular, younger patients could benefit from early recognition and treatment of well-known cardiovascular risk factors.
