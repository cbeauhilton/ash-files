    "abstract_text": "Increased levels of the alternatively spliced \u03b3\u2032 chain of fibrinogen have been measured in patients suffering from coronary artery disease ( Lovely et al. Thromb. Haemost.  2002 ; 88 : 26 \u201331 ). Others have suggested that the \u03b3\u2032 chain serves as a binding site for factor XIII ( Siebenlist et al. Biochemistry  1996 ; 35 : 10448 \u201310453 ), thus increasing the amount of cross-linking and therefore the stability of the \u03b3\u2032-containing clots ( Falls and Farrell JBC  1997 ; 272 : 14251 \u201314256 ). We have expressed recombinant \u03b3\u2032/\u03b3\u2032 homodimer and \u03b3/\u03b3\u2032 heterodimer fibrinogen variants in CHO cells and characterized their polymerization by turbidity. Compared to normal recombinant \u03b3/\u03b3 fibrinogen, \u03b3\u2032/\u03b3\u2032 fibrinogen displayed a slower rate of polymerization and a lower final absorbance. \u03b3/\u03b3\u2032 Heterodimer fibrinogen had both a polymerization rate and final absorbance that was intermediate between \u03b3/\u03b3 and \u03b3\u2032/\u03b3\u2032. These observations suggest that the presence of the \u03b3\u2032 chain slows lateral aggregation and leads to the formation of thinner fibers. These variants were then used to investigate the binding of factor XIII to fibrinogen. We designed an ELISA assay to measure this binding by immobilizing fibrinogen on a 96-well plate, incubating with factor XIII, and measuring bound factor XIII with an anti-factor XIII A-subunit antibody. Normal recombinant \u03b3/\u03b3 fibrinogen bound factor XIII zymogen (A 2 B 2 ) with a K D of 4.1 x 10 \u22128 M +/\u2212 1.3 x 10 \u22128 M, similar to previous data for plasma fibrinogen. Surprisingly, both \u03b3\u2032/\u03b3\u2032 and \u03b3/\u03b3\u2032 fibrinogen variants bound factor XIII zymogen with the same K D as did \u03b3/\u03b3 fibrinogen. As shown by ELISAs with antibodies specific for either \u03b3 or \u03b3\u2032, the C-termini of both the \u03b3 and the \u03b3\u2032 chains are accessible on this immobilized fibrinogen. These findings suggest that the C-terminus of the \u03b3\u2032 chain is not a critical element in the binding of factor XIII zymogen. Our findings differ from previously reported findings. Further studies are in progress to reconcile these differences."
