    "abstract_text": "We have previously described a patient with platelet phospholipase C (PLC)-\u03b22 deficiency characterized by impaired platelet responses to activation with multiple G-protein coupled receptor agonists. The PLC-\u03b22 coding sequence was normal and platelet PLC-\u03b22 mRNA levels were decreased in the patient ( Blood , 2002 , 99 : 905 ). Very little is currently known regarding the transcriptional regulation of PLC-\u03b22. PCR-amplification of patient leukocyte DNA and sequencing of the PLC-\u03b22 5\u2032-upstream region revealed a heterozygous 13-bp deletion (\u22121645 to \u22121633 bp from ATG) that encompasses a consensus binding site (GGGAATTCCC) for nuclear factor-\u03baB, NF-\u03baB. This deletion was present in the propositus and her affected son, but not in control subjects. PCR amplification of region \u22121791 to \u22121606 bp of genomic DNA revealed one band in 5 control subjects (size ~186 bp) on agarose gel electrophoresis but 2 bands in the patient and her son, consistent with a heterozygous defect. Luciferase reporter gene studies were performed in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 30 nM) to induce megakaryocytic transformation. Genomic fragment (\u22121648/\u221223 nt) of PLC-\u03b22 5\u2032-upstream sequence and its truncated form without the 13 nt region (\u22121633/\u221223 nt) were inserted upstream of luciferase gene in a promoterless expression vector PGL3-basic (Promega) and transiently transfected into HEL cells. Truncation of the wild-type \u22121648/\u221223 fragment at 1631 bp resulted in a consistent decrease in promoter activity by ~ 25% (6 experiments, p<0.05). Protein binding assay (EMSA) was performed using PMA-treated HEL cell nuclear extracts and oligonucleotide probes (\u22121652/\u22121628 bp) with wild-type and mutated NF-\u03baB consensus sites. Specific protein binding to the wild-type oligonucleotide was abolished when the NF-\u03baB consensus sequence was deleted or mutated. Protein binding to wild-type probe was not competed by the unlabeled mutant oligonucleotide lacking NF-\u03baB consensus sequence. In supershift assay, antibody targeted against the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB abolished protein binding, indicating a role for NF-\u03baB. In summary, our studies demonstrate in the 5\u2032-upstream region of PLC-\u03b22 gene of the patient a 13-bp deletion that has a consensus site for NF-\u03baB. Luciferase gene promoter assays demonstrate loss of activity when the 13-bp site is truncated. These studies provide evidence that impaired regulation of PLC-\u03b22 gene by NF-\u03baB may be the basis for the PLC-\u03b22 deficiency in our patient. They show for the first time that PLC-\u03b22, the most abundant \u03b2-PLC in platelets, is regulated by NF-\u03baB. These findings are highly relevant because of the important role of PLC-\u03b22 in platelet function, and of NF-\u03baB in megakaryocytic differentiation and atherosclerosis.",
