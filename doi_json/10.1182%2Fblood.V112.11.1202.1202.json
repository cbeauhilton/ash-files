    "abstract_text": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with characteristic genomic aberrations as defined by FISH and SNP arrays. CLL with del11q is characterized by a relatively aggressive clinical course, and about one third of cases carry mutations in ATM on the retained allele. Little information is available on additional molecular aberrations associated with del11q in CLL. We have analyzed del11q in a subset of 178 CLL cases using DNA from FACS-sorted CD19+ cells compared with buccal DNA using the Affymetrix 50k SNP array platform. Genomic copy number analysis using dChipSNP identified two non-overlapping minimal deleted regions on 11q, one of which spans ATM . We proceeded to use comparative expression array profiling of RNA derived from sorted CD19+ cells from 10 CLL cases with and nine cases without del11q using the Affymetrix U133 2.0 Plus platform. Analysis of normalized data identified ~85 probe sets with differential expression (del11q versus reference) that displayed a false discovery rate of 90% pure CLL cells from 10 cases with del11q and with high INSR expression versus cases without del11q and absent expression confirmed the accuracy of Q-PCR-based estimates of INSR expression. Work is in progress to measure effects of INSR expression on CLL survival and insulin-induced signaling in CLL in an effort to dissect functional consequences of INSR expression in CLL.",
