    "abstract_text": "Background Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an incurable indolent disease with a heterogeneous course. The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) is the most commonly used prognostic system to predict survival. Rituximab-based immunochemotherapy is now the standard choice for the first-line therapy of FL, followed by rituximab maintenance (RM) in patients with response, which prolongs the progression-free survival (PFS). However, the role of RM in different FLIPI risk groups has never been studied as we know. In this study, we aimed to illustrate the effect of RM in FLIPI risk groups. Methods Newly diagnosed FL patients at our center were enrolled in this analysis. All the patients received the rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy induction regimens. Response assessments were determined according to Lugano's 2014 criteria. Patients who didn't respond to induction were excluded. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Results From May 2003 to September 2020, 203 newly diagnosed FL were included. 192 patients (95.0%) achieved remission (complete response, CR/partial response, PR) after immunochemotherapy induction, of whom 96 patients continued rituximab maintenance therapies every 3 months for 1-2 years (RM group) (median 7 times\uff0crange 4 to 12). 96 patients received no maintenance or fewer than 4 times (control group) (median 0 times, range 0-3). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics other than the Ann Arbor stage and pathological grade. The RM group patients were more likely to be at low grade (71.8% vs 54.9%, P = 0.042) and advanced stage (90.6% vs 78.7% , P = 0.027) (Table 1). After a median follow-up of 36.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.2 to 40.6), median OS and PFS were not reached. The 5-year OS rates and PFS rates were 95.1% (95%CI, 90.2%-100%) and 83.0% (95%CI, 75%-91%)(Fig 1). And RM significantly prolonged the PFS, with 5-year PFS rates 92.2% (95%CI, 85.1%-99.3%) and 70.3%(95%CI, 55%-85.6%) ( P = 0.0003) (Fig 2). According to FLIPI risk stratification, patients were classified into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups. The 5-year PFS rates were 97.7% (95%CI, 93.2%-100%), 84.7% (95%CI, 70.4%-99%), and 67.8% (95%CI, 49%-86.6%), respectively (Fig 3). For low-risk patients, there was no significant difference in PFS for the RM group vs the control group. However, for both intermediate risk and high-risk patients, PFS was significantly longer in the RM group compared to the control group ( P < 0.0001). The PFS rates at 5 years in intermediate-risk patients were 100% and 77.8% (95%CI, 40.8%-92.6%), for the RM group vs control group, high risk 76.4% (95%CI, 54.3%-98.5%), and 54.9% (95%CI, 21.6%-88.2%), respectively (Fig 4). Conclusion Standard rituximab maintenance significantly prolongs progression-free survival in FLIPI intermediate risk and high-risk patients with FL, but not in the FLIPI low risk group.
