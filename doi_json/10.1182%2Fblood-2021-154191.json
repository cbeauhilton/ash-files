    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND GVHD and non-relapse mortality (NRM) remain frequent complications of HLA-matched HSCT despite the use of standard immunosuppression like tacrolimus and methotrexate. Alternative GVHD prophylaxis (PPX) strategies like T-cell depletion and post-transplant cyclophosphamide negatively impact relapse, infection, and organ toxicity, and no strategy has yet demonstrated a clear benefit for GVHD-free survival. Orca-T is an investigational cellular product comprising stem and immune cells that leverages highly purified donor regulatory T cells to control alloreactive immune responses. Unlike point-of-care graft engineering approaches, Orca-T is produced in a central GMP laboratory and has been successfully distributed to multiple centers across in the U.S. Early clinical trials using Orca-T showed a good safety profile, promising GVHD control, and potentially improved immune reconstitution. Here, we present trial results from both a single-institution Phase 1/2 trial that has completed enrollment and an ongoing multicenter Phase 1b trial. METHODS As of 28 July 2021, 113 patients aged 18-72 have received Orca-T for AML, ALL, MDS, lymphoma, or myelofibrosis. We present here data from 80 patients that have \u226590 days follow-up. 28 and 52 patients, respectively, received Orca-T followed by single-agent GVHD prophylaxis on a single-center Phase 2 study (NCT01660607) and a multicenter Phase Ib (NCT04013685). Orca-T products were derived from HLA-matched related (n=46) or unrelated (n=34) donors. Patients received a variety of myeloablative conditioning regimens (e.g., non-TBI, n=66; TBI-based, n=14) followed by single-agent PPX with either tacrolimus (n=73) or sirolimus (n=7). Median follow-up for these patients is 541 days (single-center) and 248 days (multicenter). We identified a contemporaneous SOC cohort, and we reported on their clinical outcomes at Stanford (n=95) with both matched related (n=52) and unrelated (n=43) transplant recipients who received unmanipulated PBSC products (median f/u 546) and methotrexate plus tacrolimus prophylaxis. RESULTS The Orca-T investigational cell therapy was manufactured reliably, delivered in less than 72 hours for all patients, and every patient enrolled received Orca-T. The Treg drug product was characterized by high Treg purity of 93.8% +/- 3.1% and a dose of 2.6 +/- 0.4 x 106 per kg (equivalent between trials). An Orca-T product was produced and infused for all patients, and there were no logistics failures or infusion reactions. All patients engrafted and Orca-T patients showed earlier neutrophil (median of 12 days vs. 14 days, p<0.0001 by Mann-Whitney U) and platelet engraftment (14 vs 17 days, p<0.0001) compared to SOC. On the single-center, Phase 2 clinical trial study at Stanford there is evidence of improved 1-year GVHD and relapse-free survival (GRFS) which was 77% (CI 51-88%) for Orca-T patients vs 34% (CI 25-44%) with SOC (Figure 1A). We observed improved rates of >grade 2 acute GVHD at Day +180 (aGVHD, 14% versus 33%), moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD at 1 year (4% versus 42%) and NRM at 1 year (0% versus 13%). Relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) trended upwards for Orca-T. Severe infectious complications were rare. Key clinical results from both Orca-T trials are summarized in Table 1; 23 of 80 patients had \u22651 year follow-up. Consistent with findings from the single-institution study, on the multicenter study, rates of moderate-to-severe cGVHD and non-relapse mortality were low at 1-year post-transplant at 3% and 4%, respectively. For all patients who received Orca-T across both studies, we observed GRFS of 72% (Figure 1B), RFS of 78%, and OS of 91% at 1 year. These survival rates compare favorably to the contemporaneous SOC control (33%, 71% and 78%, respectively). Immune reconstitution in Orca-T patients with single agent tacrolimus appears similar to SOC except for observable differences in the IL-2 pathway. CONCLUSIONS Manufacture of high precision Orca-T investigational cell therapy drug products was scaled in a central GMP with reliable distribution to centers. Patients that received Orca-T and single-agent PPX showed significantly reduced aGVHD, cGVHD and NRM. Orca-T shows promise to improve GRFS and other transplant outcomes. Orca-T has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy status by the FDA, and a phase 3 prospectively, randomized study is planned.
