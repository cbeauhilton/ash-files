    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4672 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) comprises 25% of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases, and its outcome is poorly understood. To improve the outcome of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), characterization of the biological features of T-ALL blast cells and the immune status of patients with T-ALL is needed to identify specific therapeutic strategies. Using a novel approach that is based on the combination of fine-tiling comparative genomic hybridization (FT-CGH) and ligation mediated PCR (LM-PCR), we molecularly identified a malignant \u00a6A\u0303\u00a6A\u0308+T cell clone with a V\u00a6A\u03085D\u00a6A\u03082J\u00a6A\u03081 rearrangement that was paired with a V\u00a6A\u0303I TCR and comprised a V\u00a6A\u03031V\u00a6A\u03085 T cell clone in relapse T-ALL patient. This malignant T cell clone was lost after chemotherapy, while the same malignant V\u00a6A\u03085 T cell clone revealed when disease relapse post allo-HSCT at 100 weeks ( Figure 1 ). Using PCR and genescan analyses, the distribution and clonality of the TCRV\u00a6A\u0303 and TCRV\u00a6A\u0308 subfamilies were examined before and after allo-HSCT in a patient with T-ALL. A reactive T cell clone with a V\u00a6A\u03084D\u00a6A\u03083J\u00a6A\u03081 rearrangement was identified in all samples taken at different time points (i.e., 4, 8, 68, 100 and 108 weeks after allo-HSCT) ( Figure 2 ). The expression of this V\u00a6A\u03084+ T cell clone was higher in the patient during complete remission post allo-SCT, and at disease relapse. In conclusion, the techniques used in this study established the sensitive detection of malignant and reactive T cell clones, and these identified T cell clones may serve not only as biomarkers for minimal residual disease detection but also as indicators for the anti-leukemia immune status in patients who achieve CR.

The monoclonal V\u00a6A\u03085 product size was 466 bp; B: pre-HSCT; C: 4 weeks post allo-HSCT; D: 8 weeks post allo-HSCT; E: 68 weeks post allo-HSCT. The clonal V\u00a6A\u03085 products were 459 and 477 bp. F: 100 weeks post allo-HSCT and disease relapse and G: 108 weeks post allo-HSCT and after one chemotherapy cycle. The same 466 bp monoclonal V\u00a6A\u03085 product is observed. The right figure demonstrates the expression level of the monoclonal V\u00a6A\u03085 gene at different time points. Fig. 1.
