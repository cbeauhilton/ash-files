    "abstract_text": "The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ that plays a critical role in the development of adaptive T cell immunity and central tolerance. Bone marrow-derived lymphoid progenitor cells migrate into the thymus and interact with thymic epithelial cells (TECs) through sequential positive and negative selection to mature. Thymus-educated mature T cells express a diverse, MHC-restricted and self-tolerant T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire that protects against infection and prevents autoimmunity. Patients born with congenital thymic aplasia, due to 22q11 Deletion Syndrome, or mutations in TBX1, FOXN1 or CHD7, present with complete absence of T cells and a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-like phenotype. Bone marrow transplantation does not cure the thymic defect in these patients and severe infections occur within the first year of life if left untreated. Allogenic thymus transplantation has provided proof of principle that HLA-unmatched pediatric donor thymic tissues can lead to successful immune reconstitution with the emergence of a diverse TCR V-beta repertoire. However, post-transplant organ-specific autoimmunity remains a major concern. Currently allogeneic thymus transplantation is no longer available in the US leaving a deadly therapeutic void for patients born without thymus. Patient-specific or histocompatible thymic tissues derived from pluripotent stem cells could address the critically unmet need, and also a broader range of clinical applications including immune reconstitution post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and tolerance induction for solid donor organs. The thymus contains two major non-hematological components: the thymic stromal cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). The thymic stromal layer is composed of thymic epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells. The thymic ECM forms a three-dimensional (3D) network to provide physical support and nutrition to thymic stromal cells. Methods: To address the need for histocompatible regenerative thymic tissues, we aim to differentiate fully functional thymic epithelial progenitor cells (TEPCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and further generate 3D transplantable organoids using engineered matrix proteins that mimic the native thymic microenvironment. Results: We have developed a novel platform to generate hPSC-derived TEPCs by dissecting the key signaling pathways that govern human thymic ontogeny. These hPSC-derived TEPCs express the defining markers of TEPC-fate, such as FoxN1, Cytokeratin 8, Cytokeratin 5, Delta-like Canonical Notch Ligand 4 (DLL4) and MHC class II. Previous studies have shown FoxN1 to be the master regulator controlling thymic development, however, little is known about its regulatory network. Elucidating and validating the factors that initiate and maintain FoxN1 expression is the key to successfully engineer sustainable thymic tissues. We have identified a combination of morphogens that can maintain the expression of FoxN1, DLL4 and AIRE of primary TECs in culture. To gain insight into the composition of primary thymic ECM proteins and adapt their characteristics beyond the features of commercially available 3D hydrogels, we analyzed a series of human fetal thymic tissues using whole transcriptome analysis. Our current work focuses on adapting our 2D culture protocol to sustain hPSC-TEPCs in 3D matrix-based organoids. Ongoing studies test the capacity of hPSC-TECPs to promote T cell maturation and the development of a diverse TCR repertoire in an athymic xenograft mouse model (NSG-FoxN1 null ). Conclusions: hPSC can be differentiated in vitro into TEPC-fate and developed into thymic organoids using custom-designed protein matrices. Studies to test sustainability and functionality of the engineered thymic organoids in vivo are currently under way. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
