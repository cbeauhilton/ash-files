    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Although advances in care have allowed individuals with SCD to live further into adulthood, treatment of adult SCD pts is challenging due to increased rates of comorbidities and complications. Here we present clinical outcomes and treatment patterns from a prospective registry of pediatric and adult pts with SCD at 3 y to better characterize disease and treatment patterns in adult pts. Methods: Pts \u22652 y old with HbSS, HbSC or HbS/\u03b2-thalassemia were enrolled from 57 US centers and assessed every 6 mo until 3 y. Differences between pediatric (<18 y) and adult pts at 3 y are reported. Results: Among 498 pts (317 pediatric; 181 adults) completing baseline visit, 74.1% had HbSS, 15.3% HbSC and 10.4% HbS/\u03b2-thalassemia; 61 pts discontinued the study. At baseline, pediatric pts had more asthma/airway reactive disease, dactylitis, and splenic sequestration (Table 1). Adults had significantly poorer performance status ( P <0.0001) and more avascular necrosis (AVN), gallbladder disease (GBD), leg ulcers, and pulmonary hypertension (PAH). The most common SCD crisis was pain, both in the 5 y prior to study (86.2% of adults, 72.2% of children) and during study (64.1% of adults, 69.4% of children; Table 2). During study, more pediatric pts had respiratory conditions, including acute chest syndrome (ACS). More than half of all pts were hospitalized; key reasons were pain, fever, and ACS. Significantly more pediatric pts were hospitalized due to fever ( P <0.0001) and significantly more adult pts were hospitalized for transfusion/chelation ( P =0.0336). Absenteeism from school/work was frequent prior to and during study. Conclusions: Patterns of disease and complications differed between children and adults. Adults had more hospitalizations due to transfusions/chelation and more classic chronic conditions (eg, AVN, GBD and PAH). Absenteeism from school/work was common in both groups. Limitations included the observational study design, variation in time from diagnosis, and lack of mandatory data collection. TABLE 1.
