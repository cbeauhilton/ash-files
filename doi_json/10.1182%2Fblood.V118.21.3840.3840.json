    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3840 Background: Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) harbor a multitude of somatic mutations involving JAK2 , MPL , LNK , CBL , TET2, ASXL1, IDH1 , IDH2 , EZH2, DNMT3A, IKZF1 and TP53 . None of these mutations have been consistently traced back to the ancestral clone and most of them are currently believed to represent secondary genetic events. The higher prevalence of IDH , LNK , IKZF1 and TP53 mutations in blast-phase MPN, as opposed to chronic-phase disease, suggests their pathogenetic contribution to leukemic transformation ( Harutyunyan A, et al. N Engl J Med. 2011;364:488 ). We examined this possibility for TP53 mutations or its SNPs in chronic-phase PMF; TP53 SNPs involving codon 72 have been associated with increased risk in the development of several cancers. Methods: Mayo Clinic MPN database was utilized to identify adult patients (>18 years) with chronic-phase PMF. Study eligibility criteria included availability of bone marrow histology and cytogenetic information at time of referral. In addition, all patients were annotated for IDH , MPL and JAK2 mutational status. Patients with blast-phase disease at the time of their referral were excluded from the study. DNA from bone marrow or peripheral blood was extracted using conventional methods and amplified with one set of primers covering TP53 exons 4 through 9. The amplification products were then sequenced with eight primers using the Big Dye Terminator sequencing kit v1.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer. Sequences were examined for mutations by the Sequencher software (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). Any mutation found was confirmed with a second PCR and sequencing reaction. A mutation was considered to be any sequence other than genomic reference sequence NC_000017 .10 or a well documented polymorphism such as the rs1042522 in exon 4. Mutations were compared with the IARC p53 Database ( http://www-p53.iarc.fr/ ) and/or the TP53 Mutation Database ( http://p53.free.fr/index.html ) to determine if the mutation had been reported before. Results I: Baseline characteristics and clinical course A total of 107 patients with chronic-phase PMF were studied. Median age at time of referral was 64 years (range 32\u201381) and 71% were males. DIPPS-plus risk assignment was low in 13%, intermediate-1 in 15%, intermediate-2 in 38% and high in 34%. Karyotype was normal in 70 (65%) patients, favorable in 26 (24%) and unfavorable in 11 (10%). JAK2 , MPL and IDH mutations were detected in 62 (58%), 7 (7%) and 6 (6%) cases, respectively. To date, 74% of patients had died and 15% had documented leukemic transformation. Results II: TP53 mutations/polymorphisms and their clinical relevance TP53 mutations were discovered in only 4 (4%) cases: i) E204E; GAG>GAA (silent exon 6); ii) G245D; GGC>GAC (exon 7); iii) R175H; CGC>CAC (exon 5); and iv) six base insert (GGCGAG) after bp13767 (exon 6). There was no significant difference in presenting features or survival between TP53 mutated and unmutated cases. None of the four patients with TP53 mutation incurred leukemic transformation. TP53 exon 4 SNPs data for codon 72 was available on 104 patients and included 58 (56%) patients with homozygous Arg72Arg, 34 (33%) patients with heterozygous Pro72Arg and 12 (11%) patients with homozygous Pro72Pro. Allele frequencies were 0.7 for G (corresponding to arginine) and 0.3 for C (corresponding to proline), which is similar to the general population (0.65 and 0.35 respectively). There were no significant differences among the three codon 72 genotypes in terms of presenting characteristics or survival. Conclusions: TP53 mutations are infrequent in chronic phase PMF. A higher number of informative cases are needed to accurately define their phenotypic or prognostic effects. We are currently analyzing more cases in this regard. On the other hand, TP53 polymorphisms at codon 72 do not appear to influence phenotype or prognosis in chronic-phase PMF. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
