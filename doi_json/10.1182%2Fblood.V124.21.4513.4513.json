    "abstract_text": "Molecularly defined clonal evolution has been identified as a key phenomenon in the biology of acute myeloid leukemia. Molecular aberrations may be markers of individual subclones of the disease, but also responsible for treatment resistance. In most patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) induces complete cytogenetic remissions (CCyR) characterized by polyclonal hematopoiesis. However, some CML patients show emergence of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities (CCA) in Philadelphia (Ph) negative cells during treatment indicating clonal hematopoiesis. We searched for BCR-ABL independent gene mutations in both Ph-negative and Ph-positive clones in 29 chronic phase CML patients (male, n=16; median age 58 years, range 29-73 years) using targeted deep next-generation sequencing of 25 genes frequently mutated in myeloid disorders: ASXL1, BRAF, CBL, DNMT3A, ETV6, EZH2, FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, KIT, KRAS, LNK, MPL, NPM1, NRAS, RUNX1, SF3B1, SRSF2, TP53, TET2, U2AF1, UTX, WT, and ZRSR2 . Ph-negative clones were analyzed in 14 CML patients who developed CCA in Ph-negative cells (trisomy 8, n=10; nonrecurrent reciprocal translocations, n=2; monosomy 7, n=2). At time of analysis, patients were in CCyR (n=7), partial CyR (n=6), or minimal CyR (n=1) after a median of 21 months (range 7-114 months) of TKI treatment with imatinib, and/or nilotinib, and/or dasatinib. After exclusion of known polymorphisms, mutations were detected in 6/14 patients (43%) affecting the genes DNMT3A, EZH2, RUNX1, TET2, TP53, U2AF1, and ZRSR2. These patients were in CCyR (n=2), partial CyR (n=3), or minimal CyR (n=1), respectively, indicating BCR-ABL independent mutations in both Ph-negative and Ph-positive subclones. In two patients, the mutations were also found in corresponding diagnostic samples at higher or lower mutation level. To further investigate BCR-ABL independent gene mutations in Ph-positive clones, 15 randomly selected CML patients at diagnosis were analyzed. Mutations additional to BCR-ABL were found in 5/15 CML patients (33%) affecting ASXL1, DNMT3A, RUNX1, and TET2 . None of the mutations were recognized in corresponding constitutional DNA specimens indicating that all mutations had been somatically acquired. Deep-sequencing of subsequent samples obtained in early CCyR after three months of TKI treatment revealed one DNMT3A mutation in Ph-negative cells which was also present in Ph-positive cells at diagnosis. Follow-up investigation showed that the mutation persisted in Ph-negative cells throughout CCyR and deep molecular remission (MR4.5) up to month 36 thereby not significantly changing its mutation level of approximately 15% implying a clonal hematopoiesis before the acquisition of the BCR - ABL rearrangement. In summary, BCR-ABL independent gene mutations were frequently found in Ph-negative and Ph-positive clones of CML patients and may be considered as important cofactors in the evolution of CML. Additional mutations acquired in the Ph-positive clone may impact on response to TKI treatment. Mutations preexisting to the occurrence of the BCR - ABL rearrangement may predispose patients to secondary hematological neoplasms. Our findings provide novel genetic information regarding CML biology and warrant further studies and impact on the design and performance of discontinuation trials.
