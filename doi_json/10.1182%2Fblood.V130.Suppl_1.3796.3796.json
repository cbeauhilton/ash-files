    "abstract_text": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) activate DNA damage response signaling pathways and multiple repair pathways depending on cell cycle stage and differentiation state. An array of recurrent, non-random chromosomal translocations are associated with hematologic malignancies, and we are interested in determining the role of specific DNA repair proteins or pathway choice in the etiology of these rearrangements. Classic non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) utilizes LIG4, XRCC4, and XLF during the final steps; LIG4 and XRCC4 deficiency is implicated in both leukemais and lymphomas but the role of XLF deficiency in leukemia etiology is not clear. Activation of alternative NHEJ (Alt-NHEJ) is largely dependent on CtIP that promotes the resection of DNA ends to uncover micro-homologies promoting the formation of large deletions and chromosomal translocations. Studies suggest that loss of efficient activity in one NHEJ repair pathway may promote use of the other more error-prone pathway. The topoisomerase II poison etoposide is a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent associated with therapy-related leukemias characterized by translocations involving the MLL gene at 11q23. Leukemias with MLL gene fusions have been detected in newborns indicating that these translocations can occur in utero, and additional evidence from our lab and others suggests maternal exposure to environmental topoisomerase II inhibitors such as bioflavonoids have the potential to promote these events. We are interested in understanding the crosstalk involved in bioflavonoid exposure, DNA damage response signaling, and repair pathway choice as a model system to understand the underlying mechanisms of oncogenic transformation in infant leukemias. Using established in vitro differentiation protocols, we expose embryonic stem (ES) cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) derived from them to a panel of bioflavonoids alone or in combination for one hour at increasing doses ranging from 0\u03bcM-200\u03bcM based on determined LD50 values. As a control, cells are exposed to etoposide at the same doses. Following exposure, cells recovered for a period of 0-24hrs, followed by protein extraction and Western blotting. Quantitation of increases in total gH2AX confirm DNA damage, presence of Ku70 and XLF to support classical NHEJ, and CtIP to support Alt-NHEJ. Cells exposed to bioflavonoids genistein and quercetin as well as etoposide show elevated \u03b3H2AX levels by 4 hrs post-treatment compared to untreated cells. Parallel studies show dose-dependent increase in the presence of \u03b3H2AX foci in these cells. These results confirm that although bioflavonoids have pleiotropic effects, they directly promote DSBs in a short period of time post-exposure. Protein levels of Ku70 and XLF in cells exposed to genistein, quercetin, and etoposide at doses of 25, 50, 75 and 100\u03bcM are not significantly different from untreated cells. However, CtIP levels are elevated in cells exposed to quercetin compared to all other groups suggesting a specific potential for this bioflavonoid to promote Alt-NHEJ repair and genome instability. To correlate the activity of these DNA repair protein activities with downstream repair products, we use a model cell system in which parental ES cells were engineered to contain two constructs: GFP exons inserted into MLL and AF9 bcr transgene fragments. Aberrant repair resulting in chromosomal translocations are scored by GFP+ fluorescence. In both ES and derived HSC populations from them translocations can be scored following exposure to bioflavonoids and etoposide. Ongoing experiments include downregulation of XLF or CtIP by siRNA in cells prior to exposure to these compounds. Results will be presented on impact of downregulation of these two NHEJ proteins on 1) amount and persistence of \u03b3H2AX; 2) protein levels of other DNA repair pathway proteins, and 3) frequency of generating chromosomal translocations. Understanding the integrated activity and role of these proteins in preventing or promoting translocations, particularly in the context of exposure to a wide range of environmental and dietary compounds, will be critical to understanding the potential for specific isoforms or mutants to increase leukemia risk.
