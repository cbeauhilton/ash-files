    "abstract_text": "Extramedullary tumors are a rare manifestation of multiple myeloma. Approximately half of these are present at initial diagnosis and the rest occur during the course of the disease. Pancreas is rarely involved by multiple myeloma and the diagnosis is often made postmortem. Lung lesions are also rarely encountered. We present a rare case of multiple myeloma with asymptomatic extraosseous soft tissue lesions in the form of multiple lung nodules and a pancreatic mass at the initial presentation. Despite his multiple extraosseous lesions, he responded well to chemotherapy and radiation therapy with resolution of pulmonary nodules, pancreatic mass and orbital mass.",
