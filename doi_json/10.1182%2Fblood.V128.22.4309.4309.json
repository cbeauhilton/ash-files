    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are hematological disorders at high risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although, next-generation sequencing has increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of these disorders, the dynamics of these changes and clonal evolution during progression have just begun to be understood. This study aimed to identify the genetic abnormalities and study the clonal evolution during the progression from MDS to AML. Methods: A combination of whole exome (WES) and targeted-deep sequencing was performed on 40 serial samples (20 MDS/CMML patients evolving to AML) collected at two time-points: at diagnosis (disease presentation) and at AML transformation (disease evolution). Patients were divided in two different groups: those who received no disease modifying treatment before they transformed into AML (n=13), and those treated with lenalidomide (Lena, n=2) and azacytidine (AZA, n=5) and then progressed. Initially, WES was performed on the whole cohort at the MDS stage and at the leukemic phase (after AML progression). Driver mutations were identified, after variant calling by a standardized bioinformatics pipeline, by using the novel tool \"Cancer Genome Interpreter\" (https://www.cancergenomeinterpreter.org). Secondly, to validate WES results, 30 paired samples of the initial cohort were analyzed with a custom capture enrichment panel of 117 genes, previously related to myeloid neoplasms. Results: A total of 121 mutations in 70 different genes were identified at the AML stage, with mostly all of them (120 mutations) already present at the MDS stage. Only 5 mutations were only detected at the MDS phase and disappeared during progression ( JAK2 , KRAS , RUNX1 , WT1 , PARN ). These results suggested that the majority of the molecular lesions occurring in MDS were already present at initial presentation of the disease, at clonal or subclonal levels, and were retained during AML evolution. To study the dynamics of these mutations during the evolution from MDS/CMML to AML, we compared the variant allele frequencies (VAFs) detected at the AML stage to that at the MDS stage in each patient. We identified different dynamics: mutations that were initially present but increased (clonal expansion; STAG2 ) or decreased (clonal reduction; TP53 ) during clinical course; mutations that were newly acquired ( BCOR ) or disappearing ( JAK2 , KRAS ) over time; and mutations that remained stable ( SRSF2 , SF3B1 ) during the evolution of the disease. It should be noted that mutational burden of STAG2 were found frequently increased (3/4 patients), with clonal sizes increasing more than three times at the AML transformation (26>80%, 12>93%, 23>86%). Similarly, in 4/8 patients with TET2 mutations, their VAFs were double increased (22>42%, 15>61%, 50>96%, 17>100%), in 2/8 were decreased (60>37%, 51>31%), while in the remaining 2 stayed stable (53>48%, 47>48%) at the AML stage. On the other hand, mutations in SRSF2 (n=3/4), IDH2 (n=2/3), ASXL1 (n=2/3), and SF3B1 (n=3/3) showed no changes during progression to AML. This could be explained somehow because, in leukemic phase, disappearing clones could be suppressed by the clonal expansion of other clones with other mutations. Furthermore we analyzed clonal dynamics in patients who received treatment with Lena or AZA and after that evolved to AML, and compared to non-treated patients. We observed that disappearing clones, initially present at diagnosis, were more frequent in the \"evolved after AZA\" group vs. non-treated (80% vs. 38%). By contrast, increasing mutations were similar between \"evolved after AZA\" and non-treated patients (60% vs. 61%). These mutations involved KRAS , DNMT1 , SMC3 , TP53 and TET2 among others. Therefore AZA treatment could remove some mutated clones. However, eventual transformation to AML would occur through persistent clones that acquire a growth advantage and expand during the course of the disease. By contrast, lenalidomide did not reduce the mutational burden in the two patients studied. Conclusions: Our study showed that the progression to AML could be explained by different mutational processes, as well as by the occurrence of unique and complex changes in the clonal architecture of the disease during the evolution. Mutations in STAG2 , a gene of the cohesin complex, could play an important role in the progression of the disease.
