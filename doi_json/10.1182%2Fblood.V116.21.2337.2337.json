    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2337 Viral infections remain a significant problem following haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Recovery of CD4+ T-cells only occurs with return of thymopoiesis 6\u201312 months after HCT. In an attempt to improve immune reconstitution and reduce viral infections following unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT), serotherapy was omitted from conditioning. 26 children, median age 19 months (range 1\u2013147) underwent unrelated CBT for immunodeficiency (13) or high risk/relapsed leukemia (13). Pre-transplant co-morbidities included lung aspergillosis (2), adenoviraemia (1), Paraflu3 respiratory tract infection (3). Conditioning was myeloablative in 25 patients. HLA matching was 6/6, 5/6 and 4/6 in 13, 14 and 3 cases respectively (4 double cords). GvHD prophylaxis was mostly cyclosporine/mycophenolate mofetil (24). The median number of nucleated, CD34+ and CD3+ cells infused was 8.12 \u00d7 10 7 /kg (range, 4.7\u201317.72), 3.5 \u00d7 10 5 /kg (range, 1.23\u201311.95) and 5.63 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (range, 1.9\u201324.45). Median time to myeloid and platelet engraftment was 22 (range, 13\u201338) and 39 (range, 21\u2013110) days. One patient died from conditioning related toxicity and 3 patients died after leukaemia relapse. 22 patients are alive and in remission with a median follow up of 12 months (range 3\u201366). 18 patients have full donor engraftment while 4 patients are mixed chimeras. Acute GvHD > grade I occurred in 16 patients (grade II n=11 ; grade III-IV n=5 ) but in general this responded to steroids and only 1 child developed cGvHD. There was no infection-related mortality, despite early adenoviraemia (4), CMV viraemia (4), HHV6 encephalitis (1) and RSV/Paraflu3 respiratory tract infections (3). The most striking finding was a rapid and sustained CD4+ T-cell expansion with conversion from naive to memory/effector phenotype. The median CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ counts at 2 months post CBT was 0.85 \u00d710 9 cells/L (range, 0.44\u20132.44), 0.55 \u00d710 9 cells/L (range, 0.06\u20131.89), and 0.21 \u00d710 9 cells/L (range, 0.01\u20131.21) respectively. As a comparison, the median CD4+ T-cell count at 2 months post a HCT from a matched sibling donor was 0.24 \u00d710 9 cells/L in 23 children evaluated in our institution. In 3 patients who developed adenoviral/CMV reactivation virus-specific T cells were detected by ELISPOT/IFN-g assays as early as 45 days post transplant, and viral infections resolved rapidly. Unrelated CBT without serotherapy results in rapid \u201cperipheral\u201d expansion of naive/memory CD4+ T-cells, and restores cell-mediated immunity in children faster than any other HCT donor source.
