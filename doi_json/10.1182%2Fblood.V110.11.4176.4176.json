    "abstract_text": "Objective This paper aims to investigate the reversal multiple of daunomycin(DNR) with different concentration of tetrandrine(tet) at different time, to study the variation of Soluble resistance related calcium binding protein (sorcin)\u2019s expression in the reversion of multidrug resistance of K562/A02 leukemic line with different concentration of tet at different time, and to provide new theoretic evidence for the clinical application of tet as resistence modifying agents. Method The reversal multiple of DNR with different concentration of tet at different time was assayed by MTT (concentration of tet is 0.5mg/l or1mg/l or 2mg/l, incubation time is 48h or 72h). The variation of the gene\u2019s expression of sorcin with different concentration of tet at different time wasassayed by RT-PCR(grouping like MTT). Result MTT analysis demonstrated that the reversal concentration was 1.81(0.5mg/l,48h),3.62(1.0mg/l,48h),6.14(2.0mg/l,48h),2.8(0.5mg/l,72h),(1.0mg/l,48h),7.12(2.0mg/l,72h) respectively. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that sorcin gene was lowly displayed in K562 cells and highly displayed in K562/A02 cells. The variation was first accentuation and then attenuation with the concentration accrescence of tet, this tendency had no obviously difference between 48h and 72h. Conclusion 1 The result of the experiment shows that tet may reverse multidrug resistance of K562/A02 cells by the down regulation of the expression of sorcin gene and proteinum; 2. It may have the concentration dependence and the time dependence in the reversion of multidrug resistance of K562/A02 cells with tet.",
