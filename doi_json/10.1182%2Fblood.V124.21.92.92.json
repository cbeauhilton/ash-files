    "abstract_text": "Platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury are key events in thrombosis and hemostasis. Platelet \u03b23 integrins and their ligands are essential in mediating these processes. Therefore the understanding of \u03b23 integrin-ligand interactions is crucial in elucidating mechanisms of thrombosis and hemostasis. In an effort to identify unknown ligands for \u03b23 integrin, we used immobilized human platelet \u03b23 integrin to capture proteins from human plasma. The isolated proteins were further analysed by 2D electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, and apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) was identified. ApoA-IV is an abundant plasma lipid binding protein secreted by the small intestine during dietary lipid absorption. Several studies in different ethnic populations have suggested that the level of apoA-IV is inversely correlated with cardiovascular diseases. However, the roles of apoA-IV in platelets and thrombosis are completely unknown. A single-molecule technique, biomembrane force probe (BFP), was employed to detect direct interactions between apoA-IV and platelet \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin. The BFP adhesion frequency assay demonstrated that apoA-IV bound to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin on ADP treated platelets. ApoA-IV also bound to purified activated \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin or the integrin expressed on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In comparison, apoA-IV did not significantly bind to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin on resting platelets, GPIb-complex expressed on CHO cells, \u03b1M\u03b22 integrin expressed on K562 cells, nor purified \u03b15\u03b21 and \u03b1v\u03b23 integrins. Importantly, apoA-IV-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 interactions in these experiments could be completely inhibited by a blocking monoclonal antibody (M1) against \u03b23 integrin. These data clearly demonstrated the specificity of apoA-IV for \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin. Furthermore, 2D kinetics measurements revealed that the effective 2D affinity of apoA-IV-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 is 43% of that between fibrinogen and \u03b1IIb\u03b23. The BFP competition assay showed that apoA-IV competitively inhibited fibrinogen-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 interactions at its physiological concentration. Platelet functional studies in vitro showed that recombinant apoA-IV significantly inhibited both mouse and human platelet aggregation following stimulation with various agonists. Consistently, platelet aggregation in platelet rich plasma of apoA-IV deficient mice (apoA-IV -/- ) was enhanced. Depletion of human plasma apoA-IV also enhanced ADP-induced human platelet aggregation. In ex vivo perfusion chambers, recombinant apoA-IV inhibited human and mouse thrombus growth and dissolved pre-formed thrombi, while absence of apoA-IV in blood enhanced ex vivo thrombus growth under both low and high shear stresses. Using two in vivo intravital microscopy thrombosis models and a carotid artery thrombosis model, we demonstrated that FeCl 3 - and laser-induced thrombosis were enhanced in apoA-IV -/- mice, while transfusion of recombinant apoA-IV markedly attenuated this process. In addition, we found recombinant apoA-IV significantly decreased platelet P-selectin expression, and consistently more P-selectin expression was observed on ADP treated platelets from apoA-IV -/- mice, suggesting that apoA-IV occupancy may inhibit fibrinogen or other prothrombotic ligands mediated \u03b1IIb\u03b23 outside-in signaling. We further found that the N-terminus of apoA-IV plays a key role in its inhibitory function and the exposure of N-terminus is negatively regulated by its C-terminus. Furthermore, mutation of the two aspartic acid (D) residues at apoA-IV N-terminal 5 and 13 abolished its binding for \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin as demonstrated by BFP adhesion frequency assay, resulting in the loss of these inhibitory effects.These findings suggest that D5 and D13 of apoA-IV are the potential binding sites for \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin. Thus, apoA-IV is identified as a novel endogenous inhibitor of thrombosis and represents a new link between lipoprotein metabolism and platelet function, both of which play critical roles in cardiovascular diseases. These findings may also contribute to hemostasis, P-selectin mediated postprandial platelet activation and inflammation. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
