    "abstract_text": "Chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell immunotherapy is a promising type of cancer therapy and substantial progress has been made in developing adoptive T cell approaches for B cell malignancies. B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is an attractive target for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) due to its high level of expression on tumor cells and restricted expression on normal tissues. Traditionally, the antigen-binding domain of a CAR is a single chain variable fragment (scFv) comprised of heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) variable fragments joined by a flexible linker that has been derived from a non-human monoclonal Ab (mAb). However, there are a number of disadvantages to scFv-based CARs including the limited availability of scFv, their potential to elicit antibody responses, and their association with tonic signaling due, in part, to inherent instability and flexibility of the structure and the potential for both HC/LC domain swapping and multimer formation through framework region interactions. Thus, replacement with alternative binding technologies may improve CAR-T efficacy in the clinic. Centyrins are alternative scaffold molecules that bind protein targets with high affinity and specificity, similar to scFv molecules. However, unlike scFv, Centyrins are smaller, derived from human consensus tenascin FN3 domains and are predicted to have decreased immunogenicity. Additionally, a monomeric Centryin in CAR format (i.e. CARTyrin molecule) is less likely to engage in domain swapping or interact with other Centyrins at the cell surface, thereby limiting the potential for the tonic signaling that drives the functional exhaustion of CAR T cells. Centyrins can be isolated against virtually any antigen through ex vivo panning of an extensive Centyrin library, yielding many distinct binders with a range of affinities and target epitopes. Panning with soluble BCMA protein yielded a large pool of BCMA-specific Centyrins, from which 11 distinct monomeric binders and 1 non-monomeric binder were selected for further study in CAR format. In addition, we tested numerous signal peptides, linkers, transmembrane domains and signaling domains to determine optimal configuration. We then created all CARTyrins by fusing each Centyrin with a CD8a leader peptide, spacer and transmembrane domain, as well as an intracellular signaling domain derived from both 4-1BB and CD3\u03b6. High quality mRNA of each CARTyrin construct was produced in order to rapidly screen CARTyrin cell surface expression and functionality in human pan T cells against BCMA + targets. We also constructed scFv-based CARs against CD19 and BCMA for comparison. Previously CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells were electroporated (EP) with mRNA encoding each of the 12 anti-BCMA CARTyrins and, the following day, analyzed for surface expression of CARTyrin and their ability to degranulate against BCMA + tumor cells. All 12 CARTyrins were detected on the cell surface and the 11 monomeric CARTyrins imparted BCMA-specific killing capacity to T cells. Notably, in these assays, CARTyrins were functionally comparable to scFv-based CARs against BCMA or to CD19-specific scFv-based CARs in a parallel assay with CD19 + tumor cells. The 11 functional anti-BCMA CARTyrins were further characterized for functional avidity by determining their activity against a panel of target cells with titrated levels of surface BCMA expression. To create this panel, various amounts of high quality BCMA mRNA were electroporated into BCMA - K562 tumor cells. After 4 hours of co-culture with the panel of BCMA expressing cells, CARTyrin + T cell activity was measured as a function of CD107a expression. We observed a range of activities by each CARTyrin and show that this assay can be utilized to determine the minimal effective dose of BCMA needed to induce killing by CARTyrin + cells. Furthermore, we establish that certain BCMA-specific CARTyrins are responsive to target cells with extremely low levels of surface BCMA expression. These results confirm that Centyrins are viable replacements for scFv in the construction of functional CARs and establish their potential utility in generating novel BCMA-specific CAR molecules, as well as other novel targetable tumor antigens.
