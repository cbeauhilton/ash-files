    "abstract_text": "Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC, also known as bone marrow-derived \u201cmesenchymal stem cells\u201d) have been used to treat acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and other complications following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We conducted a phase I trial using third party, early passage, BMSC for patients with steroid-refractory liver or gastrointestinal GVHD, tissue injury or marrow failure following SCT to investigate safety and clinical responses following BMSC infusion. To identify mechanisms of BMSC immunomodulation and tissue repair, patients were monitored for plasma GVHD biomarkers, cytokines, growth factors, and lymphocyte phenotype before and after BMSC infusion. BMSCs were prepared from marrow aspirates from healthy volunteers with the expansion of 3 passages. Ten subjects were infused a fixed dose of 2 x 10 6 BMSCs /kg weekly for 3 doses. There was no treatment related toxicity (primary endpoint). Eight subjects were evaluable for response assessment at 4 weeks after the last infusion. Five of the seven patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD achieved complete remission (CR), two of two patients with tissue injury (pneumomediastinum/ pneumothorax) achieved resolution but there was no response in two subjects with delayed marrow failure. Rapid reductions in inflammatory cytokines occurred after the first BMSC infusion (fig1). Clinical responses correlated with a fall in biomarkers (Reg 3\u03b1, CK18, and Elafin) relevant for the site of GVHD, or CK18 for tissue injury. The GVHD complete responders survived significantly longer (>300 days vs a median of 33 days), had higher baseline absolute lymphocyte and central memory CD4 and CD8 counts but there was no clear difference in natural or induced T regs . Cytokine changes also segregated with survival. These results confirm that BMSC are associated with rapid clinical responses and biomarker normalization in steroid-refractory GVHD and PM. However BMSC were ineffective in patients with more aggressive GVHD with lower lymphocyte counts, which suggest that effective GVHD control by BMSC, requires a relatively intact immune system. Early detection and BMSC treatment appear important in patients with refractory GVHD. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
