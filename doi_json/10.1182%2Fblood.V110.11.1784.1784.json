    "abstract_text": "Cooley\u2019s Anemia (CA) is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders all marked by the complete absence of adult \u03b2-globin chains in red blood cells (RBCs). Newborns with CA are healthy because of the high level of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) present at birth. As HbF levels decline during the first year of life, the absence of functional adult \u03b2-globin genes results in a severe anemia that necessitates the initiation of regular blood transfusions for the remainder of life. CA has been difficult to study in murine models due to the lack of a human fetal hemoglobin equivalent in the mouse. This study reports a novel preclinical animal model of CA that survives solely on human fetal hemoglobin at birth and is blood transfusion dependent for life upon completion of the hemoglobin switch after birth. These humanized CA mice were generated by targeted gene replacement in embryonic stem cells of the adult mouse \u03b1-globin genes with human \u03b1-globin and the adult mouse \u03b2-globin genes with a delayed switching \u03b3\u03b4\u03b2 0 -globin gene cassette. The nonfunctional human \u03b2 0 -globin knock-in allele contains a single G to A nucleotide mutation in the first base of intervening sequence 1. Both wild-type and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) promoter mutations were tested in the human \u03b3-globin knock-in allele. Heterozygous knock-in mice exhibit \u03b2 thalassemia intermedia. Newborn homozygous knock-in mice express 100% human hemoglobin in their RBCs, suffer from ineffective erythropoiesis, survive from one to ten days after birth, and are blood transfusion dependent for adult life. This is the first CA mouse model that recapitulates the temporal onset of the disease in human patients. This CA disease model is useful for the study of the regulation of globin gene expression, synthesis, and switching; development of transfusion and iron chelation therapies; induction of fetal hemoglobin synthesis; and the testing of novel genetic and cell-based therapies for the correction of thalassemia."
