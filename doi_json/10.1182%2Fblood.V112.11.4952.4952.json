    "abstract_text": "Background: The Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphomas (NHL) in childhood are usually high grade and diffuse histology. They require intensified short duration chemotherapy in contrast to adult NHL. The aim of our study was to observe the result of aggressive short duration chemotherapy in paediatric NHL. Materials & Methods: We included consecutive 160 paediatric NHL patients in paediatric haemato-oncology department of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Cancer Research Institute during period from June 1996 to December 2007. The inclusion criteria were patients less than 25 yrs of age with a diagnosis of NHL and Patients are clinically staged according to the St. Jude\u2019s (Murphy\u2019s) classification. Patients with > 25% blasts in the bone marrow were treated as leukemia and excluded from the study. Each patient received 3 cycles A and 3 cycles B of MCP842 protocol of INCTR. Response was assessed at the completion of 2cycles of chemotherapy (1 each of A and B). Result: A total of 160 previously untreated patients were entered in this study. The age range was 1 to 25 yrs (median 13.5). Fourty Eight (48) patients had Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (LL), 64 patients (40%) had Burkitt Lymphoma, 40 (25%) diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLCL) and 8 (5%) had Anaplastic Large Cell. The abdomen was the most common site (56%) of involvement followed by the mediastinum (15.62%). One hundred and Thirty four (134)(83.75%) patients achieved complete response after 2 cycles of therapy, 14 patients (8.75%) achieved partial response and 6 (3.75%) had no response, 6 (3.75%) were not evaluable. With median follow up of 4 & 1/2 yaers (range 7 months \u2013 10 years) a total of 38 (23.75%)patients (19 LL, 13 Burkitt Lymphoma, 5 DLCL and 1 ALCL) have died. The causes of death were progressive disease in 26 (16.25%), infection in 6 (3.75%), tumour lysis in 4 (2.5%), hepatitis in 1 (0.63%), and unknown 1 (0.63%). One hundred and twenty two (122) patients (76.25%) are alive and in complete remission. The patients tolerated chemotherapy well. Grade IV febrile Neutropenia was seen in 34 patients (21.25%). Conclusion: Result of MCP 842 was promising and we will continue the protocol in future.",
