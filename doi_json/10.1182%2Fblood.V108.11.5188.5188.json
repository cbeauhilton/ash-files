    "abstract_text": "Alternative splicing is a process that removes introns and alters exons to generate multiple isoforms from a single pre-mRNA transcript. Alternative splicing is the major mechanism by which a small number of human genes (6 \u00d7 10 4 ) can encode the larger complexity of the human proteome (1 \u00d7 10 6 proteins). Previously we demonstrated that alternative splicing of apoptosis-regulatory protein transcripts regulates immune responses by modulating lymphocyte survival ( Immunity, 1997; Mol. Immunol. 2002; J Exp Med , 2002; Oncogene 2005; Biochem J, 2005). To examine the hypothesis that alternative splicing plays a role in selection of nonmutated self-protein isoforms for tumor antigens and autoantigens, recently, we showed that alternative splicing is a major mechanism in regulation of the immunogenicity of tumor antigen CML66 ( J. Immunol . 2004). In addition, we found that alternative splicing occurs in 100% of the autoantigen transcripts. This is significantly higher than the approximately 42% rate of alternative splicing observed in the 10,000 randomly selected human gene transcripts ( p <0.001) [ J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. , 2004 (cover article)]. Here, we report that essential alternative splicing factor ASF/SF2 expression in samples from patients with chronic inflammation is lower than that of the healthy controls ( p <0.05). In addition, TNF-a significantly downregulates ASF/SF2 expression (7 folds) in cultured cells in comparison to the expression variations of b-actin control. These findings demonstrate that ASF/SF2, presumably affecting splicing of self-antigen transcripts, is downregulated in autoimmune inflammatory disease potentially via a TNF-a-mediated pathway. Collectively, we propose for the first time a novel model of \u201cstimulation-responsive splicing\u201d, which emphasizes that stimulation-responsive splicing plays a critical role in selection of nonmutated self-protein isoforms to become tumor antigens and autoantigens ( Clin. Immunol. Invited Review, in press, 2006). The new model for the definition of immunogenic isoforms of tumor antigens and autoantigens is significant in facilitating the development of: immunogenic antigen isoform microarrays for disease diagnosis and prognosis; autoantigen-tolerizing therapy and splicing-redirection therapy for autoimmune diseases; and immunogenic antigen isoforms-based immunotherapy for tumors.",
