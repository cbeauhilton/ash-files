    "abstract_text": "The major mechanism to adapt to ischemic conditions is the development of neovascularization, i.e. angiogenesis, a process driven by members of VEGF family of growth factors. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway is a critical component of the signaling network that regulates endothelial cell function related to angiogenesis. VEGF treatment of endothelial cells results in rapid phosphorylation of Akt. Our studies demonstrated that Akt kinase activity is necessary for VEGF-induced and integrin-mediated endothelial cell adhesion and migration. Moreover, cell transfection with a constitutive active form of Akt (myr-Akt) leads to increased function of integrin receptors. Using Akt-1 null mice we found that Akt-1 controls VEGF-induced and integrin-dependent endothelial cell responses in vitro. Impaired endothelial cell migration and adhesion to extracellular matrix and a reduced rate of cell proliferation were observed in Akt-1 (\u2212/\u2212) endothelial cells compared to WT. There are three Akt isoforms with different tissue distribution, however, it appears that Akt-1 is a predominant isoform in skin and in skin microvasculature. This observation prompted us to perform series of in vivo experiments designed to assess the angiogenic response in skin in the absence of Akt-1. Angiogenesis assay using matrigel plugs revealed that the weight and hemoglobin content of matrigel plugs is about two fold higher in Akt (\u2212/\u2212) mice compared to WT mice. Tumor angiogenesis also appears to be enhanced in Akt(\u2212/\u2212) mice, resulting in the significantly lower degree of tumor necrosis. Blood vessels in Akt (\u2212/\u2212) mice appear to be smaller in diameter and have reduced laminin content. Our analysis revealed significant changes in blood vessel wall matrix composition of Akt (\u2212/\u2212) mice as compared to WT animals. These changes resulted in increased vascular permeability in skin of Akt (\u2212/\u2212) mice. Akt-1 is known to target multiple cellular processes including adhesive properties, cell survival, transcription and translation. It appears that the phenotype of Akt-1 (\u2212/\u2212) mice depends on the equilibrium between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic roles of Akt-1 and reveals a central role for Akt-1 in the regulation of matrix production and maturation of blood vessels.",
