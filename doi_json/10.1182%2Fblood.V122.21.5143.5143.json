    "abstract_text": "Background Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) is a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma characterized by heterogeneous infiltration of bone marrow and IgM monoclonal gammopathy. WM constitutes 1-2% of haematological malignancies and patients exhibit diverse outcome. Given the current therapies WM remains incurable with high rate of relapse, therefore, the quest for finding a more effective drug continues. PRIMA-1 met is a small molecule with the ability to restore wild type conformation to mutant P53 and to activate wild type P53. PRIMA-1 met has shown significant anti-tumour activity both in vitro and in vivo by inducing apoptosis in several human cancers including haematological malignancies and is currently under phase I/II clinical trials. To date, the effects of PRIMA-1 met have not been explored in WM. Here we examined the antitumor activity of PRIMA-1 met alone and in combination with dexamethasone or bortezomib in WM. Design WM cell lines, BCWM-1(Wild type P53) and MWCL-1 (mutant P53), were used for these studies. Cellular proliferation, viability, migration and percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis in WM cells treated with PRIMA-1 met or DMSO control were evaluated using trypan blue, MTT assay, Boyden chamber assay and Annexin-V staining methods respectively. The status of key role players in apoptosis and cell cycle regulators were examined following treatment with PRIMA-1 met using qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Cell viability was also investigated by combining PRIMA-1 met with either dexamethasone or bortezomib in WM cells by MTT assay. Result Both BCWM-1 and MWCL-1 cells showed significant decrease in cell viability after exposure to escalating doses of PRIMA-1 met with observed IC 50 of 30 \u03bcM in BCWM-1 cells and 28 \u03bcM in MWCL-1 cells after 48 hours. Two primary WM patients\u2019 samples exposed to increasing concentration of PRIMA-1 met demonstrated significant decrease in cell viability with IC 50 of 30 and 10 \u03bcM after 48 hours. Importantly, peripheral and bone marrow mononuclear cells of 3 healthy donors were subjected to PRIMA-1 met and no significant cytotoxicity was observed. Both cell lines showed an increase in apoptosis after PRIMA-1 met treatment in a dose-dependent manner compared to control DMSO treatment. In BCWM-1, cell proliferation, measured by counting viable cells after 7 days, was significantly inhibited by PRIMA-1 met compared to DMSO control (\u223c54% fewer cells when treated with 25 \u03bcM PRIMA-1 met , p<0.05). Decrease in cell migration by as much as 28% at 25 \u03bcM compared to DMSO control (p<0.001) was also observed after 8 hours of treatment with PRIMA-1 met . Expressions of P53 and its downstream target p21 were elevated in PRIMA-1 met treated cells compared to DMSO control. In addition, qRT-PCR studies of 50 genes associated with apoptosis also demonstrated enhanced expression of pro-apoptotic markers such as PUMA, Noxa, caspase 8 and 9, BIM and BAD, which were further confirmed for their protein expressions by Western blot analysis. Finally, PRIMA-1 met (25 \u03bcM) was found to exert synergistic cytotoxic effect in combination with dexamethasone (2 \u03bcM) in MWCL-1 cells (Combination index (CI)=0.5). PRIMA-1 met (25 \u03bcM) also displayed synergism with bortezomib (3 \u03bcM) in its cytotoxicity toward BCWM-1 cells (CI=0.8). Conclusions Our results demonstrate that PRIMA-1 met induces apoptosis irrespective of P53 status in WM cells. It also provides the preclinical framework for evaluation of PRIMA-1 met either alone or in combination with bortezomib or dexamethasone as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of WM patients.
