    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2878 Primary plasma-cell leukemia (pPCL) is an aggressive, rare variant of plasma cell (PC) dyscrasia characterized by extra-medullary proliferation of PCs, high genomic instability and very poor prognosis. The present study was aimed at investigating global genomics in 17 pPCL recruited in an open-label, exploratory, single-arm, two-stage study from the GIMEMA myeloma network designed to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of lenalidomide in combination with low dose dexamethasone as first-line therapy in pPCL. All the samples were characterized for the main chromosomal aberrations by Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH). Specifically, 13q and 17p deletions have been identified in 13 (76.5%) and 6 (35.3%) cases, respectively; the presence of t(11;14) translocation was found in 7 patients (41.2%), t(4;14) in 2 (11.8%) and t(14;16) in 7 (41.2%). To better define the chromosomal alterations of this set of patients, we further investigated them by means of Human Mapping 250K Nsp SNP-array (Affymetrix). SNP-array data were fully concordant with FISH results as regards 13q and 17p deletions in the analyzed patients. Among the copy number alterations identified by mapping analysis the most frequently gained chromosomal region was represented by 1q (9 cases, 52.9%); 1p, 8p, 14q, and 16q arms were affected by loss of DNA material in more than 40% of cases. Moreover, four patients showed gain at 7q (23.5%), one case displayed a near tetraploid karyotype and another one had a hyperdiploid-like pattern. Most of the minimally altered regions identified on the different chromosomes encompassed genes that have been reported to be deregulated in PC dyscrasia, such as CDKN2C (mapped to 1p32.3), FAM46C (1p12), CKS1B (1q21.2), PARK2 (6q26), PPP2R2A (8p21.2), RB1 and MIR-15A/16-1 (13q14.2), TRAF3 (14q32.32), CYLD (16q12.1), WWOX (16q23.3-q24.1), and TP53 (17p13.1). The mutational analysis of the most frequently mutated exons (5\u20139) of TP53 gene revealed the presence of coding mutations in 4 patients (23.5%), three of which carried a monoallelic deletion including the gene locus. This supports the knowledge that the prevalence of TP53 mutations increases in more advanced disease and is strongly associated with hemizygosity. Genome-wide profiling data were then integrated with the transcriptional profiles generated on Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix). Our analysis (Wilcoxon rank-sum test at a P <0.001) identified 134 transcripts whose expression levels strongly correlated with the occurrence of allelic imbalances, all of them in the previously described altered regions; specifically, 42 mapped to gained regions on 1q (40/134=29.9%) and 7q (1.5%), and 92 mapped to deleted regions on 1p (10.4%), 6q (6.7%), 8p (10.4%), 13q (9.7%), 14q (18.7%), 16q (6.0%) and 17p (6.7%). Enriched categories in functional annotation analysis are protein metabolism, transport, catabolic processes as the proteasome ubiquitination pathway ( PSMC6 , PSMA3 , PSMB4 and PSMD4 ), and telomere organization and maintenance ( PINX1 , PARP1 and WRN ). Overall, our data highlighted a wide gene-dosage effect, suggesting that genomic structural abnormalities in pPCL closely reflect in expression imbalances.
