    "abstract_text": "MICA and MICB (MICA/B) are expressed by many human cancers due to cellular stress and tag cells for elimination by cytotoxic lymphocytes through NKG2D receptor activation. However, tumors evade this immune recognition pathway through proteolytic shedding of MICA/B proteins. We rationally designed antibodies targeting the MICA \u03b13 domain, the site of proteolytic shedding, and found that these antibodies prevented loss of cell surface MICA/B by human cancer cells. These antibodies inhibited tumor growth in multiple fully immunocompetent mouse models and also reduced human melanoma metastases in a humanized mouse model. Anti-tumor immunity was mediated mainly by NK cells through activation of NKG2D and CD16 Fc receptors. This novel approach prevents the loss of important immunostimulatory ligands by human cancers and reactivates antitumor immunity.
