    "abstract_text": "Short-term restimulation assays combined with the analysis of effector function, in particular the detection of cytokine production, are useful tools for the analysis and isolation of antigen-specific T cells. Until now, restimulations with soluble protein antigens failed to efficiently reactivate CD8 + T cells. We have developed a recombinant protein of the immunodominant cytomegalovirus (CMV) matrix protein pp65 for in vitro restimulation of pp65-specific CD4 + as well as CD8 + T cells. The efficiency of the CMV pp65 - Recombinant Protein to reactivate pp65-experienced CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and the specificity of the restimulated T cells were analysed. PBMC from CMV seropositive donors were restimulated with CMV pp65 - Recombinant Protein or a complete pool of overlapping pp65 peptides. Afterwards T cells were analysed for intracellular IFN-\u03b3 production by flow cytometry. Interestingly, we observed that stimulation with CMV pp65 - Recombinant Protein results in IFN-\u03b3 production in CD4 + as well as CD8 + T cells with frequencies comparable to that using the peptide pool as antigen (n=17). In contrast, upon stimulation of PBMC from CMV seronegative donors with CMV pp65 - Recombinant Protein neither IFN-\u03b3 nor TNF-\u03b1 were detectable in T cells (n=6). Furthermore, we tested the specificity of CMV pp65 - Recombinant Protein-reactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Therefore, IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells were magnetically isolated after short-term stimulation with pp65 using the IFN-\u03b3 cytokine secretion assay and expanded for 7 days. Subsequently, the isolated and expanded CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were restimulated with pp65 peptide pool. More than 80 % of the CD4 + and CD8 + T cells produced IFN-\u03b3 and more than 80 % of the CD8 + T cells were positively stained with MHC class I/pp65 tetramers. These results demonstrate that CMV pp65 - Recombinant Protein efficiently and specifically reactivates pp65-experienced CD4 + as well as CD8 + T cells. Therefore, CMV pp65 - Recombinant Protein is a useful antigen for the detection and isolation of pp65-experienced CD4 + and CD8 + effector/memory T cells.",
