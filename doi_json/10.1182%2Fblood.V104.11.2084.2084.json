    "abstract_text": "Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate (THF) required for the synthesis of thymidylate and purines. Methotrexate (MTX) acts as a tight-binding inhibitor of DHFR and remains an important chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of leukemias and lymphomas. Increased DHFR confers resistance to antifolates in target cells. A previously reported single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 829C/C\u2192829T/T (829C\u2192T) found in the 3\u2032- untranslated region of DHFR gene transcript (between the first and second polyadenylation site) was associated with higher expression of the DHFR transcript. The SNP was identified in 5.4% of the cases and 6.0% in the controls of Japanese patients with childhood leukemia/lymphomas (Goto et al. 2001, Clinical Cancer Research, Vol. 7, 1952-1956). The objective of the present study was to determine the role of the 3\u2032 UTR SNP 829C\u2192T in DHFR gene expression, DHFR protein level and resistance to MTX. The mutation 829C\u2192T in the 3\u2032 UTR of wild type DHFR was introduced by site directed mutagenesis and the mutant cDNA expressed in DHFR deficient CHO cells (DG-44), wild type DHFR and vector alone constructs were also transfected into DG44 as controls. After two weeks of selection in G418 containing media, several well-isolated surviving colonies were picked and expanded as cell lines in media containing G418. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to compare mRNA and genomic DNA level of the clones while Western blotting was used to compare the protein levels. MTX cytotoxicity assay was carried out in media lacking thymidine. Clones expressing the mutant 829C\u2192T showed greater than two fold enhanced expression of DHFR transcripts as compared to wild type clones. Corresponding to the high mRNA levels, an increase in DHFR protein level was observed in the mutant clones without an increase in DHFR gene copy number. Cytotoxicity studies showed that cell lines with increased levels of DHFR were significantly more resistant to MTX than cells with wild type 3\u2032 UTR. Of interest clonogenic efficiency of the mutants in medium lacking thymidine was greater than wild type and was directly proportional to the level of DHFR expressed in the clones. This study demonstrates that when SNP 829C\u2192T is introduced in the 3\u2032 UTR of wild type DHFR, the expression of the DHFR mRNA is enhanced with a corresponding increase in the protein level. The presence of a SNP 829C\u2192T in patients with ALL may contribute to treatment failure, as MTX is a key drug in curative regimen for this disease. Future studies are directed toward determining the abundance of this SNP in other populations, and the correlation between this SNP and clinical methotrexate resistance and or decreased MTX toxicity.",
