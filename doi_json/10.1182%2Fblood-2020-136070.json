Methods PRP is applied externally to the necrotizing fasciitis wound after activated with 10% calcium gluconate, then with dressing fixed. PRP is used once a day after the wound is cleaned. The wound area is measured once, wound tissue type and drainage is recorded. Granulation area and percentage are calculated. Results The case one patient underwent negative pressure drainage treatment before the treatment of PRP. The wound area was 49.41cm 2 , involving the entire skin layer, with little fluid exudation. The skin around the wound was dry and curving. After 6 times of PRP treatment, the wound was reduced to 15.4cm 2 without exudation, and the tissue type was fresh granulation, with 100% granulation proportion. The wound was kept clean after discharge, and reduced to 1.25cm 2 after 1 month without special treatment. The wound was fully healed after 2 months, and there was no wound or rupture after the follow up visit of 12 months. The case two patient underwent negative pressure drainage treatment on the wound surface. The wound area was 106.25cm 2 and the depth was 1.0cm. The whole skin was involved with stealth. After 21 times of PRP treatment, the wound was reduced to 64.35cm 2 , and the tissue type was carrion + granulation, which accounted for 85.73%. After autologous skin graft, 100% survived, and the wound was followed up without rupture 10 months later. Conclusion PRP is a safe and effective method for the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis and promotes wound healing through the release of various growth factors by \u03b1-particles in activated platelets. PRP provides a new and effective treatment method for the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis by creating conditions for skin graft, shortening the length of hospital stay, and even eliminating the need for skin graft treatment for some wounds.
