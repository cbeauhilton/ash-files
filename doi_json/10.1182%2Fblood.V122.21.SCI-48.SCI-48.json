    "abstract_text": "The initiation of blood-specific programs is orchestrated by key transcription factors. To generate a complete compendium of chromatin factors that establish the epigenetic code during developmental hematopoiesis, a large-scale reverse genetic screen was conducted targeting orthologs of 425 human chromatin factors in zebrafish. A set of chromatin regulators was identified that function at distinct steps of primitive and definitive blood formation, including factors not previously implicated in blood development. We identified 15 factors that regulate development of primitive erythroid progenitors and 29 factors that regulate development of definitive stem and progenitor cells. These chromatin factors are associated with SWI/SNF and ISWI chromatin remodeling, SET1/MLL methyltransferase, CBP/P300/HBO1/NuA4 acetyltransferase, Sin3A/NuRD deacetylase, and Polycomb repressive complexes. Knockdown of a class of chromatin factors led to an expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In collaboration with Nancy Speck\u2019s laboratory, we have investigated the activity of one of these chromatin factors, CHD7, that led to an expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the aorta. Using a T-cell line, a CBF\u03b2 protein pulldown, and a mass spectrometric sequencing approach led to the finding that CBF\u03b2 immunoprecipitated RUNX1 and CHD7 . By studying a conditional allele of murine Chd7 , inactivation does not have an effect on peripheral blood counts, but Chd7 -deleted HSCs purified based on phenotypic markers contain an increased number of functional HSCs. Our studies suggest that CHD7 suppresses hematopoiesis, and provides a novel control mechanism for the regulation of HSCs. Our work provides a comprehensive view of how specific chromatin factors and their associated complexes play a major role in the establishment of hematopoietic cells in vivo .
