    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4487 Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) remains a major cause of late death and morbidity after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, and the treatment of cGVHD remains challenging. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a potent vitamin A derivative, can regulate immune responses. Synthetic retinoid Am80, which shows biological activity approximately 10 times more potent than that of ATRA by binding to RAR\u03b1 and RAR\u03b2, but not RAR\u03b3, also reduces the severity and progression of immune disease models, including those for contact dermatitis, collagen-induced arthritis, allergic encephalomyelitis, and atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that the administration of ATRA or Am80 could modulate cGVHD. BALB/c (H-2 d ) mice were subjected to sublethal irradiation and injected with 8 \u00d7 10 6 T-cell-depleted bone marrow cells and 8 \u00d7 10 6 spleen cells from major histocompatibility complex-matched, multiple minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched B10.D2 (H-2 d ) mice. Then, the mice were given oral ATRA (200 \u03bcg/body), Am80 (1.0 mg/kg body weight), or vehicle daily, beginning from day 0. ATRA slightly decreased the clinical cGVHD score, whereas Am80 significantly reduced the score (Table). When administered daily, Am80 decreased the clinical score beginning from day 21, as in a treatment setting (data not shown). Histopathological examination of the skin showed significantly reduced GVHD pathology in recipients of Am80 (Table). Flow cytometry analysis of the peripheral draining lymph nodes on day 16 showed significant reductions in IFN-\u03b3 + , IL-17 + , and Foxp3 + cells in Am80-treated recipients compared to controls (Table), whereas no reduction in IL-13 + cells was observed. Cytometric bead arrays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) revealed decreased levels of the cytokines IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 in the supernatant of peripheral lymph nodes from Am80-administered recipients (data not shown). Real-time RT-PCR of ears from these recipients on day 21 showed that the administration of Am80 reduced the expression of Foxp3 and TGF-\u03b2 (Table and data not shown). Therefore, the administration of retinoids ameliorates cGVHD by reducing Th1 and Th17 inflammatory cytokines and the fibrosis factor TGF-\u03b2. Thus, treatment with retinoids may be effective for prophylaxis and treatment of cGVHD.  View large View Large Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
