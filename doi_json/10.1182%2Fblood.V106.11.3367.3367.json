    "abstract_text": "We have previously demonstrated constitutive activation of MAPK signaling in 70% of primary AML samples ( Millela et al, JCI  108 : 851 \u2013859, 2001 ), suggesting that upstream kinases (Raf and MEK) may play a role in the leukemic transformation of myeloid cells. BAY 43-9006 is a small molecule Raf kinase inhibitor that has demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity against solid human tumors in xenograft models. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that BAY 43-9006 inhibits leukemia cell growth and/or induces apoptosis by suppressing the activity of the MAPK pathway. In the in vitro kinase assay, BAY 43-9006 inhibited both Raf-1 and B-Raf-mediated MEK1 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, with Raf-1 kinase being more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of BAY 43-9006 (IC 50Raf-1 , 1.37 \u03bcM vs. IC 50B-Raf , 4.64 \u03bcM). BAY 43-9006 suppressed MEK1/2 and ERK phosphorylation in the AML cell lines OCI-AML3, HL-60, U937 and KG-1 in a dose-dependent manner after 24 hr treatment. Unexpectedly, BAY 43-9006 also inhibited AKT phosphorylation on Ser473 (after 4.5 hrs). BAY 43-9006 inhibited growth of AML cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of BAY 43-9006 was 0.39, 1.14, 2.86 and 2.80 \u03bcM, respectively in OCI-AML3, HL-60, U937 and KG-1 cells after 72 hrs. This growth-inhibitory effect was mediated by a dose-dependent induction of cell cycle arrest in G1 mediated by the down-regulation of the cell cycle-related proteins cyclin E, cdk2 and cdc2, followed by induction of apoptosis after 72 hrs. In primary AML patient samples, BAY 43-9006 not only inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis after 48\u201372 hrs in vitro , but also preferentially inhibited colony formation of AML progenitor cells compared to normal bone marrow cells [IC 50 : 2.33 \u03bcM vs . 9.34\u03bcM (CFU-GM), 5.69 \u03bcM (Erythroid) and 3.75 \u03bcM (Mixed), respectively]. Time-course analyses demonstrated that BAY 43-9006 suppressed phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim (at 4.5 hrs), caused loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release (at 6 hrs) followed by cleavage of caspases-3 and -9 but not of caspase-8, suggesting primary involvement of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Furthermore, the pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Bax were up-regulated after 48 hrs of BAY 43-9006 treatment, and the level of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein Survivin was down-regulated after 48 hrs. In summary, our data demonstrates that BAY 43-9006 inhibits Raf-MEK-ERK signaling and induces apoptosis in AML via Bim de-phosphorylation and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The potential of BAY 43-9006 in the therapy of AML patients will be tested in a Phase I clinical trial.",
