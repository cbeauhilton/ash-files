    "abstract_text": "New definitions of response for patients with AML have been suggested, e.g. CRp, marrow CR, hematologic improvement. Although the criteria for these are less demanding than those for CR, some have proposed that their attainment can convert AML to a \u201cchronic disease\u201d associated with long-term survival. To test this hypothesis, we used ECOG and MDA data to assess the effect of the achievement of CR rather than responses < CR following initial Rx on probabilities of survival 3 and 5 years after diagnosis. 2,061 pts treated on 6 ECOG trials 1976\u20131999 and 1,651 pts given various ara-C-containing regimens at M.D. Anderson 1980\u20131999 formed our database. We excluded from the survival analyses the 473 pts (11% ECOG,16% MDA)who died within 4 weeks of beginning treatment. CR rates were 62% and 60% for ECOG and MDA pts, respectively. 11% of ECOG and 54% of MDA pts were age \u2265 60. CR rates in these pts were 46% ECOG and 49% MDA. Survival probabilities according to site and response to initial Rx are as follows:  Group . Site/Response to Initial Rx . Patients . Probability Survival at 3 Years (%+/\u2212SE) . Probability Survival at 5 Years (%+/\u2212 SE) .

Nonetheless, our data indicate that in older pts given ara-C-containing regimens, long-term survival is essentially impossible without achievement of CR. Similarly, very few younger pts not achieving CR survive at 3\u20135 years. Therefore, it appears likely that newer \u201ctargeted agents\u201d will have to contribute more than producing responses < CR and must fundamentally change the biology of the disease to improve long-term survival in AML."
