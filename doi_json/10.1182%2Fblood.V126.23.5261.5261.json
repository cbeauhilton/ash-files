    "abstract_text": "The myelodysplastic syndromes are clonal hematological disorders of the stem Cell, and clinically characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and morphological dispoyesis. The affected patients have a high risk of leukemic transformation. In a total of (n=416) patients studied, (n=247) patients (59.3%) corresponded with a female gender, with an average age of = 59 years (limits 15-99 yrs), and (n=169) male patients (40.6%), with average age of =62 years (limits 09-89 yrs). In (n = 295) studied patients, 71% had normal karyotype 46, XX or 46, XY, where in 16% (n = 66) of the samples cell growth was not attained. In (n = 54) of patient samples, 13% showed karyotype changes, including those frequently reported for MDS; and 11.1% (n = 6) with -Y, 11q 1.8% (n = 1), del20q 3.7% (n = 2), +8 3.7% (n = 2), - 21 1.8% (n = 1), del 7q 1.8% (n = 1), inv3 1.8% (n = 1), complex karyotypes 12.9 % (n = 7) cases. Other alterations include, simple anomalies: +2 1.8% (n = 1), +13 5.5% (n = 3), del17q 1.8% (n = 1), del4p 1.8 %(n=1), del9q 3.7% (n = 2), der21q 3.7 %(n = 2), del17p3 3.7% (n = 2), t (1; 7) 1.8% (n = 1), t (4; 12) 1.8% (n = 1), rob13 1.8% (n = 1); 14, r2 1.8%(n = 1); double anomalies, delXq and del10q (n = 1), del18p and del13q (n = 1). Among other findings, polymorphisms in (n=15) patients (27.7%), such as 1qh + (n = 2), 9qh + (n = 4), 16qh + (n = 3), 14PS + (n = 1), 15ps + (n = 2) , 22ps + (n = 1), inv9 (n = 2). According with IPSS-R karyotypes, samples were classified as very favorable 12.9% (n = 7), pro 3.7% (n = 4), Intermediate 40.7% (n = 22), 1.8% unfavorable ( n = 1) and very favorable 18.5% (n = 12.9).
