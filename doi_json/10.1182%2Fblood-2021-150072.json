    "abstract_text": "Introduction-Aim: Chronic idiopathic neutropenia (CIN) is a neutrophil disorder characterized by the prolonged and unexplained reduction in the number of peripheral blood (PB) absolute neutrophil counts (ANC). The underlying pathogenesis in CIN implicates the production of proinflammatory cytokines by activated lymphocytes and monocytes that induce excessive apoptotic death of the bone marrow (BM) granulocytic progenitor cells. Clonal hematopoiesis identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) of myeloid genes is found in 11% of CIN patients conferring an increased risk for MDS/AML transformation whereas the non-clonal patients display usually a benign course. The basis for the immune cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine production in CIN remains obscure. Based on previously reported data showing increased frequency of mutations of the MEFV gene encoding pyrin in patients with idiopathic inflammatory conditions other than typical Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), we sought to investigate the common MEFV mutations in a cohort of well characterized CIN patients. Patients-Methods: We have studied 50 patients fulfilling the previously reported diagnostic criteria of CIN (median ANC 1.5x10 9 /L, range 0.2-1.7 x10 9 /L), 44 females and 6 males with a median age of 56 years (range 25-87 years) and a long-follow-up (median 132 months, range 8-336 months) in the Department of Hematology of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Nonisotopic RNase cleavage assay (NIRCA) analysis was used as first screening method to detect MEFV exons 10 and 2 mutations in DNA extracted from PB or BM samples from CIN patients, confirmed by direct NGS analysis. These sequences contain the main disease-related mutations and polymorphisms. Results: Genetics alterations of MEFV were detected in 22 out of 50 CIN patients (44%). Pathogenic mutations (variants associated with typical or \"atypical\" FMF phenotype in Greek population) were identified in 10/50 CIN patients (20%). The 20% frequency of MEFV mutations in exon 10 and/or exon 2 in CIN patients is significantly higher compared to the carrier rate of common MEFV mutations in the healthy Greek population (0.7%) according to our previously reported data (PATG; Ile>Met), two patients with heterozygous A744S (GCC>TCC; Ala>Ser) and one with homozygosity, one patient with heterozygous M694V (ATG>GTG; Met>Val), one with heterozygous K695R (AAG>AGG; Lys>Arg) and one with heterozygous M680I (ATG>ATC; Met>Ile), all in exon 10, and (b) four patients with homozygous R202Q mutation in exon 2 (one patient with homozygous A744S co-mutation in exon 10) and two patients with R202Q heterozygosity combined with heterozygosity of I720M and A744S of exons 10, respectively. None of the patients displayed any symptoms/signs of FMF or other systemic inflammatory disease. No statistically significant differences were identified between MEFV mutated and non-mutated CIN patients in the severity of neutropenia or in lymphocyte, monocyte, hemoglobin and platelet counts. A significant difference was identified between the two patient groups in serum IgG (1440\u00b1264 vs 1133\u00b1245 mg/dl; P = 0.0023, Mann-Whitney test) but not IgA or IgM levels. Discussion: This study reports for the first time that 20% of unselected, consecutive patients with CIN carry mutations of the MEFV gene without clinical manifestations of FMF. Whether these patients represent atypical cases of FMF or the identified MEFV genetic alterations have a pathogenetic/modifying effect in the inflammatory responses associated with CIN is an open/novel field of research. As a first step we are currently investigating the neutrophil autophagic status, IL-1\u03b2 production and the neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in CIN patients with mutations in MEFV to clarify their potential effect in the immune deregulation known to characterize CIN.
