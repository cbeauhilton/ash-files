    "abstract_text": "Introduction Deletion of chromosome 5q (del(5q)) defines a distinct clinical subtype of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and qualifies patients to specific treatment with Lenalidomide (LEN). Therefore, detection and monitoring of this deletion is an important element in routine clinical diagnostics for determining molecular response. Current methodologies for performing these analyses consist of cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or microarrays. All of these methods have downsides due to the high demands to the input material, i.e. viable cells or necessity for large amounts of high quality genomic DNA (gDNA). To perform quantitative assessment of cytogenetic lesions in low quantity or residual material we here present the establishment of a PCR-based assay for interrogation of del(5q) in MDS, based on the allelic loss at heterozygous short tandem repeat (STR) loci within deleted regions. Methods Genomic DNA was isolated from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) of n=86 MDS del(5q) patients. 49 non-del(5q) MDS patients were used as controls. Serial chronological BM samples (n=95) following treatment with LEN from n=40 del(5q) patients, who were enrolled in the LEMON-5 trial from the German MDS study group, were analysed. Using 10ng DNA, 12 fluorochrome-labelled PCR amplicons of STR loci located between chromosomal bands 5q21 and 5q31 were amplified in a single optimized multiplex-PCR reaction. Subsequently, amplicon fragment analysis was carried out via capillary electrophoresis and allele size quantification of heterozygous STR loci was performed. Finally, the degree of skewing in the allelic ratios of all informative STR markers was averaged and translated into an allelic burden of del(5q). Results Paired quantitative correlation of clone sizes using STR-PCR and interphase FISH was carried out in n=34 samples and revealed highly concordant results with r\u00b2=0.924. The diagnostic accuracy of the PCR assay was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and revealed an area under the curve of 0.989 (sensitivity and specificity of 0.977 and 0.948, respectively). Prior to treatment with LEN, clone sizes as determined by STR-PCR were heterogeneous (mean: 57%, range: 11-91%). During follow-up analysis, while cytogenetic analyses failed (e.g. metaphase failure) in 7/40 (18%) cases, our STR-PCR assay successfully generated estimates of del(5q) cell burden in all available samples. Upon LEN treatment, n=12 patients achieved major cytogenetic remission (absence of del(5q)-positive metaphases). The mean clone size carrying del(5q) determined by STR-PCR in that group was 7% (range 3 - 10%) and significantly increased compared with n=15 patients who reached minor cytogenetic response (defined as 50% reduced aberrant metaphases, mean 13%, range 5 - 39%, p=0.025). Intriguingly none of n=6 patients without cytogenetic response achieved a del(5q) clone size of less than 35% as determined by STR-PCR (mean 46%, range 35 - 66%), highlighting the correlation of PCR based follow-up analysis with currently used cytogenetic methods for response evaluation. Finally in n=93 matched PB and BM samples a correlation of del(5q)-frequency in BM versus PB showed r\u00b2=0.81. Moreover, in 96% of samples in which the BM still showed clone sizes >10%, we reliably detected del(5q) in corresponding PB cells with a robust sensitivity of 5% deleted cells. Discussion We present a highly adaptable tool for precise measurement of large chromosomal deletions, requiring only minute amounts of genomic DNA. It shows a very good quantitative correlation with established methods and good diagnostic accuracy. Most importantly, this PCR based assay does not require dividing cells so it can be performed from PB, which shows a sufficient correlation with clone sizes in BM and rarely involves the risk of underrepresentation of del(5q)-clones in PB, possibly allowing the use of PB as a regular specimen for clone size monitoring. Thus, especially in the context of serially monitored patients this assay represents an alternative method for less invasive tracking of cytogenetically aberrant clones.
