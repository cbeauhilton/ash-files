    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4532 Introduction: In an unicenter analysis we investigated the impact of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (RIC-HCT) after reduced intensity conditioning on the kinetics of engraftment and predictor of outcome in 50 patients with advanced CLL. Patient and Methods: Patients in advanced stage CLL (n=50) received Fludarabine 30mg/m 2 on day -4 to -2 and 2Gy TBI on day 0 followed by cyclosporine and MMF from unrelated (n=40) or related (n=10) donors between June 1999 and March 2010 at the University of Leipzig. The majority of patients (n= 35) were male, had Binet C (n=37, 74%) at RIC-HCT. The median age was 58 (range 44\u201369) years. Of 48 patients for whom cytogenetic analyses were available, 22 (46%) had unfavourable cytogenetics including del 17 or del 11q. Three (6%) patients had CR, 27 (54%) PR, 7 (14%) progressive disease, 12 (24%) stable disease and one (5%) relapse at RIC-HCT. Resistance to first line therapy was present in 25 (50%) patients, whereas 12 (24%) were resistant to Fludarabine. Richter\u2019s transformation was found in six patients (12%). Chimerism was detected in bone marrow and peripheral blood on T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocyte subpopulation after sorting at monthly intervals in the posttransplant period and than in 6 months interval. Results: Hematological toxicities after RIC-HCT were moderate. The majority of patients (96%) engrafted with neutrophiles >500/\u03bc L median at day 22 after HCT. Six (12%) and 15 (30%) patients maintained absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) >0,5 \u00d7 10 9 /L and platelet counts >50 \u00d7 10 9 /L, respectively. T-cell donor chimerism increased to >95% at day 56 and B-cell donor chimerism to 94% at day +360, respectively. B-CLL cells disappeared completely on day +360 (median 0%). Overall survival (OS) at 4 years was 51%, Non relapse related mortality (NRM) 30%, Progression-free survival 33% and progression/relapse 37%. The most common causes of NRM were GvHD (n= 7; 14%) and sepsis (n=3, 6%). Factors significantly associated with increased risk of relapse/progression were intermediate/advanced disease vs. CR/PR1 (p=0.022) and lymphocytes \u2265 5 \u00d7 10 9 /L vs. < 5 \u00d7 10 9 /L (18% vs. 58%, p= 0.00) at 12 months in univariate analysis. Conclusion: Full donor T-cell chimerism was reached early after HCT, while B-cell reconstitution was observed only 1.5 years after RIC-HCT despite the absence of evident disease by 360 days after RIC-HCT. Best predictor for Progression-free survival (PFS) was CR or PR1. Disclosures: Po\u0308nisch: Mundipharma: Honoraria, Research Funding."
