    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4347 Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that is characterized by a whole-body inflammatory state (called a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, SIRS). Long pentraxin PTX3 is an inflammatory mediator and a component of the humoral arm of innate immunity produced by neutrophils, macrophages, myeloid dendritic and endothelial cells. During sepsis a massive inflammatory activation and coagulation/fibrinolysis dysfunction occur. However, little is known about PTX3 in septic patients with DIC. Therefore, we measured PTX3s in the plasma from septic patients with DIC (n=20). Also, we investigated PTX3 in the plasma from septic patients without DIC (n=8) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-induced DIC (n=5). PTX3 in the plasma from human were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Perseus Proteomics Inc, Japan). The thrombin antithrombin complexes (TAT) levels were higher in both DIC patients as reported by others. We detected high levels of PTX3 in the plasma of all septic patients with DIC. Also, plasma levels of PTX3 were positive in septic patients without DIC. However, plasma levels of PTX3 were significantly higher in septic patients with DIC than in septic patients without DIC. Plasma levels of PTX3 ware significantly correlated with severity of septic DIC (platelet count and TAT level). We did not find any difference plasma levels of PTX3 in the APL patients with DIC. Moreover, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) concentrations in the human plasma were determined using ELISA kit (Shino-Test, Japan). Plasma levels of HMBG1 were positive for 14 cases in 20 septic patients with DIC. Also, we did not find any difference plasma levels of HMGB1 in the APL patients with DIC. These results suggest that assess of PTX3 and HMBG1 in the plasma may be helpful in the making the diagnosis in septic patients with DIC. However, PTX3 seemed to be a better biomarker than HMGB1. It appears that PTX3 may contribute to the severity of septic DIC. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
