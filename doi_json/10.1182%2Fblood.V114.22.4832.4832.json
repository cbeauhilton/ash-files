    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4832 To explore the expression level of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-IR) in malignant clone cells of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Method Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunochemistry (APAAP, alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase) were used together to detect the expression of IGF-IR in the bone marrow cells of 26 MDS patients with known abnormal karyotypes. Result The average IGF-IR expression level on the surface of clone cells from the 26 MDS cases was markedly elevated compared to the corresponding level in normal cells (78.2\u00b113.7% vs 14.1\u00b114.0%,P <0.0001). The percentages of malignant clone cells in all 26 MDS cases were significantly correlated with the respective percentages of IGF-IR positive nucleated cells (r = 0.909; P <0.0001). No significant difference in the IGF-IR expression level on the clone cells were observed either between high- and low-risk MDS patients or among MDS patients with different abnormal karyotypes. Conclusion IGF-IR might be taken as a marker of clone cells in MDS because of its propensity to cause malignant proliferation. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
