    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1386 Background: The CALM-AF10 fusion protein arises from the t(10;11) chromosomal translocation and is found in 8\u201310% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias and a smaller percentage of acute myeloid leukemias; these hematopoietic malignancies are associated with a poor clinical outcome. The precise contributions of the Clathrin Assembly Lymphoid Myeloid leukemia (CALM) protein to leukemogenesis remain uncertain. CALM plays a role in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, which mediates the entry of growth factor receptors and nutrients into cells and is essential for the internalization of iron-bound transferrin. We have previously shown that Calm -deficient ( Calm \u2212/\u2212 ) mouse fibroblasts derived from fit1 mice are iron deficient, and are more sensitive to treatment with iron chelators. Objective: Since CALM-AF10 leukemia cells are haploinsufficient for CALM , we hypothesize that reduced levels of CALM in CALM-AF10 leukemia cells cause a relative iron deficiency, and result in enhanced sensitivity to iron deprivation. Design/Methods: Fibroblasts and fetal liver hematopoietic progenitors (HP) were derived from Calm \u2212/\u2212 , Calm +/\u2212 or Calm +/+ E14 embryos. The proliferation rates of non-immortalized fibroblasts were compared in the presence and absence of supplemental iron (ferric ammonium citrate (FAC)) or treatment with an iron chelator (deferoxamine (DFO)). Surface transferrin receptor expression was quantified by flow cytometry. Primary HP cells were cultured in the presence or absence of DFO and viable cell numbers were determined. To examine the anti-leukemic effect of iron deprivation in vivo , C57BL/6J-Tyr c-2J mice were fed a low-iron diet, transplanted with CALM-AF10 -transduced Calm +/\u2212 leukemia cells and leukemia latency was determined. Results: Heterozygous Calm +/\u2212 fibroblasts exhibit CALM protein levels that are intermediate between their wildtype ( Calm +/+ ) and deficient ( Calm \u2212/\u2212 ) counterparts. Calm +/\u2212 cells display a slower rate of proliferation in vitro (50% reduction of viable cells) compared to their wildtype fibroblasts, and this growth deficiency can be corrected by iron supplementation with 50 mM FAC. The presence of reduced intracellular iron levels in Calm +/\u2212 fibroblasts was manifested by increased transferrin receptor expression relative to wildtype cells. In vitro, Calm +/\u2212 HP cells showed greater sensitivity to iron chelation by DFO (5 mM) than Calm +/+ controls: the relative number of viable cells in the presence of DFO was 20% lower in Calm +/\u2212 compared to Calm +/\u2212 HP cells. To assess the impact of iron deprivation in vivo , bone marrow cells from Calm +/\u2212 CALM-AF10 leukemic mice were injected into secondary recipient mice preconditioned by having received a low-iron diet for 8 weeks (n=9). The onset of leukemia in transplanted mice maintained on the iron-deficient diet was considerably delayed (median survival 93 days versus 63 days, p=0.013) relative to age- and gender-matched control mice fed a normal diet (n=9). Conclusions: We have shown that reduced CALM expression impairs iron import and consequently limits the rate of cell proliferation. Both in vitro and in vivo results suggest that CALM haploinsufficient CALM-AF10 leukemias are particularly sensitive to iron deprivation. This raises the possibility that iron chelation may be a previously unappreciated treatment option for patients with aggressive CALM -rearranged leukemias. We are currently studying the impact of iron chelation in murine CALM-AF10 in vivo leukemia models. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
