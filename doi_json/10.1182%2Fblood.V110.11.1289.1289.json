    "abstract_text": "Background: FL3 is a subcategory of follicular lymphomas that is challenging in that it behaves aggressively like large cell lymphomas. If treated with CHOP, however it has a clinical course of relapse and treatment failure similar to grade 1\u20132 follicular lymphoma. We looked at the outcome of FL3 patients treated with RCHOP, combining rituximab with CHOP. There are no large study reports of this regimen\u2019s results in FL3 to our knowledge. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 45 patients with follicular grade 3 lymphoma who were treated with rituximab and the combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC). Response rate (RR), failure-free survival (FFS), and overall survival (OS) were estimated and a historical comparison to 111 CHOP only treated patients was made. Results: The International Prognostic Index (IPI) distribution was: 47% Low, 36% Low-Intermediate, 13% High-intermediate, and 4% High-risk. The complete response rate was 96%. Forty-four out of 45 patients are still alive. Median follow-up is 3.5 years. The 3-year FFS rate according to IPI was 80% (95% CI: 64% to 100%) in low risk, 81% in low-intermediate (95% CI 64% to 100%), and was 50% (95% CI: 25% to 100%) in high-intermediate/high-risk patient group. The addition of rituximab to CHOP improved both 5-year FFS, 71% (95% CI: 58% to 87%) compared to 44% of CHOP alone (95% CI: 36% to 55%) with p-value of 0.019 and 5-year OS, 98% (95% CI: 93% to 100%) compared to 75% (95% CI: 67% to 84) with p-valule of 0.0034. The addition of rituximab to CHOP improve the FFS compared to CHOP alone when subgroups of IPI were analyzed and compared (p=.002) Conclusion: The addition of rituximab to CHOP provided a high response rate and excellent early survival. Poor risk patients continue to demonstrate a high rate of failure despite the use of rituximab.",
