    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Proteasome inhibitors (PI), immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) and the CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab (dara) have transformed the management of MM, yet eventual refractoriness to these agents seems inevitable. Relapsed and refractory MM (RRMM) which becomes triple class refractory (TCR, i.e. refractory to a PI, an IMiD and Dara) uncommonly responds to further lines of therapy and survival is dismal. Selinexor is a selective inhibitor of nuclear export compound targeting exportin 1 (XPO1) which is overexpressed in MM cells and essential for their survival. In the STORM study, selinexor in combination with low-dose dexamethasone (Sd) demonstrated promising efficacy in TCR, penta-exposed (TCR-PE, i.e. exposed to lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib and dara) MM. Establishing the natural history for outcomes in the TCR-PE population can help provide context to understand the outcomes observed with Sd in STORM. In the retrospective MAMMOTH study, we reported the outcomes of patients with RRMM after they became refractory to dara, including a subset of patients who were TCR. We further analyzed the MAMMOTH dataset to generate a cohort of patients similar to patients in STORM in order to compare conventional care vs. Sd. Methods: We included all patients in STORM who received Sd as the first line therapy after they achieved TCR-PE status (n=64). We extracted from the MAMMOTH dataset all patients who were not exposed to Sd in a subsequent line of therapy, became TCR-PE and who received subsequent MM-directed therapy (n=128). Overall response rate (ORR) was evaluated according to IMWG criteria. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the time of initiation of next line of therapy after TCR-PE status until death or last follow-up. We compared OS in STORM vs. MAMMOTH utilizing cox-regression analysis with adjustment for covariables potentially influencing the outcome. Results: Baseline patient characteristics and prior therapies are per table. The two cohorts were similar in terms of age, number of prior lines of therapy and presence of high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. STORM patients had longer time between MM diagnosis and post TCR-PE therapy with a higher proportion of refractoriness to carfilzomib. Patients in STORM had ORR to Sd of 32.8% vs 25.0% for patients receiving conventional care in MAMMOTH (P=0.078). In direct comparison, patients in STORM had better OS than patients in MAMMOTH (median 10.4 vs. 6.9 months) (P=0.043, figure). In multivariate analysis, STORM patients had lower risk of death in comparison with MAMMOTH patients (aHR=0.55, 95%C.I. 0.35-0.86, P=0.009). Refractoriness to carfilzomib (aHR=2.20, 95%C.I. 1.16-4.15, P=0.015) and high-risk cytogenetics (aHR-1.66, 95% C.I. 1.13-2.42, P=0.009) were also associated with inferior OS. Conclusion: Despite inherent limitations in comparison of trial enrollees vs. real world patients, this analysis suggests improved OS with Sd vs conventional care in patients with TCR-PE RRMM. Prognosis for these patients remains poor and underscores the need for therapeutic advancements.
