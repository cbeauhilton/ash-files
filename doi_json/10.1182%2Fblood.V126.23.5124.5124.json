    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is characterized by t(11;14) resulting in a constitutive cyclin D1 overexpression. The cyclin D1-CDK4/6 complex inactivates Rb through phosphorylation, leading to G1/S-phase transition. Therefore, inhibition of CDK4/6 is an efficient and rational approach to overcome cell cycle dysregulation in MCL. We evaluated the efficiency of the novel CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib in various MCL cell lines and in primary MCL cells in combination with cytarabine (AraC) and ibrutinib. Material & Methods : MCL cell lines (Granta 519, JeKo-1, Maver-1, Mino) and primary MCL cells were exposed to abemaciclib alone and combined with AraC or ibrutinib. Cells were pretreated with abemaciclib and exposed to AraC or ibrutinib with or without consecutive wash-out of the CDK4/6 inhibitor. Proliferation and viability were measured by tryptan blue staining and Cell Titer Glo assay. Flow cytometry was used for cell-cycle (PI-staining) and apoptosis analysis (Annexin V PE/7AAD-staining). Western Blot analysis showed protein expression and phosphorylation status of various downstream proteins. Results : Abemaciclib inhibited cell proliferation by induction of early G1-arrest. Western Blot analysis revealed reduced phosphorylation of Rb on serine 795 without changes in CDK 4 and cyclin D1 expression, in line with reversible cell cycle arrest. IC50-values of sensitive cell lines (JeKo-1, Maver-1, Mino) were <30 nM after 72 h. We observed an almost complete and reversible G1-arrest in all sensitive cell lines by FACS analysis (JeKo-1: G1-phase +51,7 %; S/G2-phase -51,7 % at 31,25 nM after 24 h; G1-phase +35,4 %; S/G2-phase -34,8 % after 72 h ), whereas cell viability was not reduced. Wash-out of abemaciclib after 24 h resulted in synchronized S-phase entry in all sensitive cell lines (e.g. Mino: G1-phase -20,4 %; S-phase +30,5 % ). The sequential combination of abemaciclib followed by AraC showed strong synergy in Mino cells ( CI=0,22 for 31,25 nM abemaciclib and 3,33 \u00b5M cytarabine). In contrast, simultaneous exposure to abemaciclib had a protective effect against AraC treatment in all sensitive cell lines, due to an ongoing G1-arrest (Mino: CI=-0,19 for 31,25 nM abemaciclib and 3,33 \u00b5M AraC). In primary MCL cells, 31,25 nM of abemaciclib had no impact on cell death. Moreover, no sensitization to AraC was observed as all cells were resting in G0-phase. The combination of abemaciclib induced G1 arrest and ibrutinib had additive or synergistic effects in sensitive cell lines (JeKo-1, Mino and Maver). Conclusion : The novel CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib causes reversible G1 cell cycle arrest without loss of viability at low nanomolar doses. Rationale drug combinations exploiting the sequential effect may achieve major benefits, but drug interactions are complex: Pretreatment with abemaciclib sensitizes MCL cell line cells to AraC whereas simultaneous application protects them from AraC treatment. Further analyses explore the interaction with other targeted approaches (inhibitors of the B-cell receptor pathway) to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms.
