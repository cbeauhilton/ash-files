    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Acute lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in elderly patients (50yrs or older) carries a poor prognosis. In survival studies using in variety of therapeutic regimens. This may be because of relatively high frequency of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). With the advent of dose intensive chemotherapy regimen such as hyper CVAD (Fractionated Cyclophosphamide, Vincristin, Doxorubicin, Dexamethasone) overall survival has not improved. The aim of our study was to see the effectiveness of Imatinib plus Vincristin & Prednisolone in Philadelphia Chromosome positive in elderly acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. Material & Methods: During period from January 2006 December 2006 we selected 10 consecutive elderly (more than 50yrs) Ph+ ALL patients in the haemato-oncology department Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Cancer Research Institute. There were 4 males & 6 females. The median age of the patient was 64years (range 51 to 77yrs). All patients were started with Imatinib mesylate (Natco pharma) 400mg daily. Prednisolone was given 40mg /m 2 over 6weeks & followed by 2weeks tapering dose. Vincristin was given 2mg/m 2 weekly for 6weeks. All patients were evaluated by bone marrow and molecular testing done every 3monthly for 1year then 6monthly. Result: All patients (100%) obtained complete haematological & partial molecular response at 3month. Three patient (30%) achieved complete molecular response at 9month. With median follow-up of 8months (range 6\u201315months) the disease free survival and overall survival were 80% & 90% respectively. Most of the induction treatment was done as OPD basis, no hospitalization required. The therapy was tolerated well. Conclusion: We concluded that Imatinib plus Vincristin & Prednisolone is a feasible, highly active protocol for elderly Philadelphia Chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. It is well tolerated & associated with good quality of life.",
