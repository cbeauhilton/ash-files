    "abstract_text": "The IRIS study compared IM and interferon+cytarabine (IFN/Ara-C) in patients (pts) with newly diagnosed CML-CP (n=553 per arm). IFN/Ara-C pts. could cross over to IM if they satisfied predetermined criteria for disease, either resistance/refractoriness (=resistance), or intolerance of or reluctance to continue the combination (=lack of resistance). Pts who received IM 1 st line or 2 nd line who achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) had BCR-ABL transcript levels measured serially by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). Results were expressed as log reduction in BCR-ABL/BCR from a standardized baseline value for untreated pts. Yearly rates of 3 log reduction (Major Molecular Response, MMR) from IM treatment starting date were estimated by multiplying the CCyR rate by the MMR rate in CCyR pts at each time point. Overall, of 553 pts who received 1 st line IM 82% achieved CCyR, an estimated 69% during the 1 st year (yr) of treatment. Of 359 pts who received 2 nd line IM, 80% achieved CCyR, 62% during the 1 st yr; rates were lower in pts with resistance than in those without resistance to prior IFN/Ara-C (75% vs 85% overall, p=0.025, 56% vs 68% within first yr, p<0.01). Best observed and estimated molecular responses for CCyR pts. are summarized in the table. The median follow-up for BCR-ABL evaluation on 1 st line vs 2 nd line IM was 45 and 35 months, respectively.

However, the number of RQ-PCR samples between 1 and 2 yrs of 2 nd line IM was limited as samples were not obtained routinely between Jan 2003 and Aug 2004. In pts who achieved CCyR, the estimated 5-yr progression rate to advanced CML phase was 3% for 1 st line IM and 4% for 2 nd line IM; using the broader definition of progression (including events such as CML-unrelated deaths and loss of MCyR/CHR) the progression rates were 9% and 8% respectively. In both 1 st and 2 nd line IM pts with CCyR who also achieved MMR, only an estimated 1% progressed to advanced phase within 5 yrs; the estimated broadly defined event rates were 5% and 4% respectively. In summary, for 1 st line IM patients with a RQ-PCR follow-up of up to 5 yrs, an estimated 85% achieved MMR at 5 yrs compared with 59% at 2 yrs. Cytogenetic and molecular response rates were similar for 1 st line and 2 nd line IM pts, primarily due to responses in pts who crossed over for reasons other than resistance or refractoriness. For IM pts the rate of progression to advanced CML phase at 5 yrs was low in those with CCyR and even lower in pts who also achieved MMR.",
