    "abstract_text": "Genetic forms of anemia caused by HBB gene mutations that impair beta globin production are extremely common worldwide. The resultant disorders, mainly sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia, cause substantial morbidity and early mortality. Treatments for these diseases include medical therapies and bone marrow transplantation (BMT), which can be curative. However, medical therapies are suboptimal and BMT is associated with serious toxicities, particularly because HLA-matched allogeneic sibling donors are not available for most patients. Thus, new therapies are urgently needed for millions of affected individuals. Gene therapy offers great promise to cure SCD and beta thalassemia and emerging genome editing technologies represent a new form of gene therapy. Approaches to cure SCD and beta-thalassemia via genome editing include: 1) Correction of HBB mutations by homology directed repair (HDR); 2) use of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to activate gamma globin production and raise fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels; 3) NHEJ to disrupt alpha-globin genes (HBA1 or HBA2) and thereby alleviate globin chain imbalance in intermediately severe forms of beta thalassemia. Challenges for these approaches include selection of the most effective genome editing tools, optimizing their delivery to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), improving specificity and better understanding potential off target effects, particularly those that are biologically relevant. Technologies for genome editing are advancing rapidly and being tested in preclinical models for HBB-mutated disorders. Ultimately, however, the best strategies can only be identified in clinical trials. This will require close collaborations between basic/translational researchers who study genome editing, clinical hematologists and collaboration between experts in academia and the bio-pharmaceutical industry.
