    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2817 Poster Board II-793 Abnormal plasma cells (PC) present in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and its precursor condition, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), characteristically possess multiple chromosomal abnormalities. Moreover, both stages of disease exhibit considerable intratumor heterogeneity, which often becomes even more complex during disease progression. The precise mechanism(s) underlying this process remains unknown. However, we hypothesize that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and compromised repair of these deleterious lesions may underlie intratumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution in the monoclonal gammopathies. In this regard, H2AX, a member of the H2A family of histones, plays a particularly important role in the DSB response and prevention of cancer. Immediately following DSB formation, one or more of the PI3K-like kinases become activated and rapidly phosphorylate H2AX on a conserved serine residue. Phosphorylated H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) is then rapidly recruited to the DSB site and is readily detectable as DNA damage foci by immunohistochemistry. The precise function of \u03b3H2AX has yet to be determined, however, it is hypothesized that \u03b3H2AX may recruit DNA repair proteins to the DSB site and may aid in keeping severed DNA ends in place in order to avoid erroneous end joining. Despite the functional uncertainty of \u03b3H2AX, the presence of \u03b3H2AX nuclear foci serves as an excellent indicator of DSBs. Therefore, the goal of our study was to assess MM cells for evidence of DSBs. We began our studies using a panel of 8 human MM cell lines. Of note, the number of foci was found to vary among the MM cell lines and to vary from cell to cell with the number of \u03b3H2AX foci per cell ranging from 0 to 28. The presence of \u03b3H2AX in these cells was also confirmed via flow cytometry and western blotting. We also wished to determine if primary MM and MGUS PCs displayed evidence of DSBs. Among primary patient samples, freshly isolated PCs from 13/18 MM patients and 1/3 MGUS patients exhibited evidence of \u03b3H2AX foci. Taken together with the MM cell line data, the number of \u03b3H2AX foci was found to increase across the disease spectrum of MGUS to MM patient sample to MM cell line. Endogenous \u03b3H2AX foci have previously been detected in a variety of tumor cell lines. Although these foci have been hypothesized to derive from multiple factors, the extent of phosphorylation has been shown to be associated with the number of chromosomal aberrations as well as the phase of the cell cycle. In general, S and G2/M phase cells tend to demonstrate higher levels of H2AX phosphorylation, which is most likely due to doubling of histone content during the cell cycle and the fact that chromatin condensation during DNA replication can also trigger H2AX phosphorylation. Thus, it remained possible that the \u03b3H2AX displayed by the cell lines simply reflected cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. To address this possibility, we labeled cells with BrdU and then measured levels of \u03b3H2AX in cells in the G1, S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. However, we observed nearly equal levels of \u03b3H2AX in G1 and S phase cells suggesting some level of \u03b3H2AX foci was independent of DNA replication. These results were also consistent with our observation that there is no correlation between the plasma cell labeling index and the number of \u03b3H2AX foci in CD138+ plasma cells isolated from 18 MM patients. Thus, endogenous \u03b3H2AX in MM cells does not appear to be primarily attributed to cycling cells and may be indeed reflective of DSBs. Finally, to further demonstrate that the \u03b3H2AX foci genuinely reflected sites of DSBs, we performed double staining for \u03b3H2AX foci and 53BP1, a protein that is known to be recruited to DSB sites following DNA damage. Results revealed clear colocalization of \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 in both MM cell lines and MM patient samples. Given that DSBs can lead to genomic instability and tumor progression, our observations that primary MGUS and MM PCs display evidence of DSBs at isolation are intriguing and suggest a mechanism whereby clonal evolution occurs in the monoclonal gammopathies. The presence of a higher frequency of \u03b3H2AX foci in MM cell lines is consistent with their derivation from MM patients with aggressive disease. Collectively, these studies suggest MGUS/MM PCs may display an impaired ability to repair DNA damage and studies designed to examine this possibility are underway.
