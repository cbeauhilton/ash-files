    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5077 Background: The incidence of BM fibrosis in MM is low and uncertain, and its causes are not known. Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in some MM patients reveals prognostically significant anomalies. Methods: Records of patients with MM seen at Kings County Hospital from 2004 through 2010 were reviewed, the histological sections of patients reported to have fibrosis we re-examined. The degree of fibrosis was graded according to the World Health Organization system. Results: Records of 113 patients were reviewed, 110 (97%) were African American (AA). Of these, 62 (55%) were female and 51 (45%) male. Their age ranged (median 65) from 38 to 89 years. Cytogenetic data (CGD) was available in 46 patients; and abnormal in 10 (22%) and normal in 36 (78%) of those. All patients with abnormalities of chromosomal number were hyperdiploid. Of 113 patients, 62 (55%) were female, 110 were African American. Ages ranged from 38\u201389 (median 65) years. Cytogenetic data was available for 46 patients and abnormal in 10 (22%). All patients with abnormal chromosome numbers were hyperdiploid. FISH studies to detect abnormalities in chromosomes 13, 14 and 17 were available in 25 and abnormal in 2 (8%). BM fibrosis had been initially noted in 27 of 113 patients (24%), and confirmed by another hematopathologist; 17 (63%) were women. The ages of the patients with fibrosis ranged from 4\u201379 years: median age was 67, 67 for the women and 62 for the men. Focal and grades 1, 2 and 3 fibrosis were noted in 2 (7%), 12 (44%), 7 (26%) and 6 (22%) of patients. Grade 3 fibrosis was found in 24% of the women and 20% of the men with fibrosis. CG data was available for 17 fibrosis patients and abnormal (hyperdipliod) in 2 (18%). FISH studies for chromosomes 13, 14 and 17 were normal in the 7 patients studied. CGD for all 8 of the female fibrosis patients studied were normal, and abnormal in 2 of the 9 men (22%). Conclusions: Of our 113 AA myeloma patients 25% had detectable BM fibrosis, but it was grade 3 in only 5%. Female preponderance was more marked in the patients with fibrosis than in the whole MM group. CG and FISH data did not distinguish patients with and without fibrosis.
