However till today clinical manifestation continues to be the key point in diagnostic procedure of these diseases and time from the first symptoms to define diagnosis and to start of anticancer treatment is often critical for pt's. prognosis. Methods Documentation of 1007 consecutive pts. referred to 3 hematological centers in Czech Republic with diagnosis of the 6 most frequent leukemias between 2004-3/2009 was analyzed. Special consideration was addressed to clinical and laboratory findings and pt's. complaints before defining the diagnosis in hematological center. Results In 1007 pts. \u2013 439 (44%) females/ 568 (56%) males \u2013 diagnosis of leukemia was established [ALL \u2013 106 (11%), AML - 369 (37%), APL - 74 (7%), HCL - 41 (4%), CML - 123 (12%), CLL - 294 (29%)]. Median age at time of diagnosis was 60 years (ALL - 47, AML - 62, APL - 46.5, HCL - 59, CML - 55, CLL \u2013 66). Leukemia was diagnosed in 599 (59%) after first symptoms occurred and pt. visited doctor and in 408 (41%) cases accidentally. However, this accidental diagnosis occurred only in 24% pts. with acute leukemia (ALL, AML, APL) and vice-versa in 60% of pts. with chronic leukemias.

Median time from the first symptoms to define diagnoses was 17 days (ALL \u2013 24, AML \u2013 20, APL \u2013 14, CLL \u2013 16, CML 14, HCL \u2013 31); median time from the first medical examination to define diagnosis was 8 days (ALL \u2013 9, AML \u2013 7, APL \u2013 6, CLL \u2013 12, CML - 6, HCL \u2013 20) and finally the median time from the first examination by hematologist to referring pt. to hematological center was 3 days (ALL \u2013 1, AML \u2013 2, APL \u2013 1, CLL \u2013 32, CML - 8, HCL \u2013 18). Decision procedure of the first visited doctor was stated as inadequate in 5.5% of pts. \u2013 especially in pts with AML (9.4%). Late diagnosis influenced character of treatment and pt's prognosis in 1.5% and 1.6% of pts. respectively \u2013 mostly in pts. with acute leukemias (2.9% and 2.8%). Conclusion Our analysis showed that the time from the first symptoms until define diagnosis is surprisingly long although pts. with acute leukemia are very often symptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Moreover in these patients with acute leukemias (especially with AML) the diagnostic process was most frequently found as a less adequate and this could influenced the pt's prognosis.
