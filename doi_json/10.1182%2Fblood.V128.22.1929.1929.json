    "abstract_text": "MAJIC is a phase II trial of Ruxolitinib (RUX) vs Best Available Therapy (BAT) in essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients with resistance/intolerance to Hydroxycarbamide (HC) per European LeukemiaNet (ELN) criteria. Primary outcome was rate of complete hematological response (CHR) within 1 year (ELN criteria); secondary outcomes included partial HR, safety, thrombosis, hemorrhage, progression free survival (including transformation), molecular response (MR), symptom & quality of life (QOL) assessment. We present new data concerning molecular, symptom & clinical responses. Patients were stratified by JAK2V617F status, patient-reported symptoms & QOL determined using EQ5D, MDASI & MPN Symptom Assessment Form (MPN10), & compared using linear mixed models of post-baseline scores through month 12 adjusting for baseline; response was defined as \u226550% reduction in MPN10 total symptom score (TSS). JAK2/CALR/MPL allele burdens were assessed at baseline & 4 monthly. 110 patients were eligible for the modified ITT analysis, 58 (52%) & 52 (48%) in RUX & BAT arms respectively, comprising 44 males, 66 females, mean age 64.2ys, & resistant (24.5%), intolerant (51.8%) or both (22.7%) to HC. CHR was achieved in 27 (46.6%) of RUX patients vs 23 (44.2%) BAT patients (\u03c7 2 test p= 0.81). PHR occurred in 26 (44.8%) & 27 (51.9%) of RUX & BAT treated respectively. Grade 3 or 4 anemia occurred in 19% & 0% for RUX arm vs 0% (both grades) for BAT arm, grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in 5.2% & 1.7% of RUX vs 0% (both grades) of BAT patients respectively. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 10.3% of RUX patients vs 3.6% BAT arm. 9 RUX treated patients had 10 thrombotic events & 1 RUX patient a hemorrhage; vs 5 thrombotic & 5 hemorrhagic events in BAT patients (adjusted following central review). Transformations to post-ET MF occurred in 8 RUX vs 3 BAT treated patients, 1 RUX patient developed AML. 2 non-treatment related deaths occurred in each arm. Mean MPN-10 TSS & individual symptoms of early satiety & itching during the first 12 months were all significantly lower for RUX vs BAT (all p<0.05). Patients who achieved CHR had significantly better TSS, fatigue, inactivity, concentration problems, & MDASI symptom interference (all p<0.05) at baseline vs those without; however, scores during treatment did not appear to differ between CHR & non CHR groups after adjusting for these baseline differences. Allele burden during study & MRs (per ELN-IWG criteria Barosi Blood 2013) are shown in Table 1. Assays for JAK2 V617F were performed independently in 3 centres using qPCR (Guy's), TSCA NGS (Oxford) & amplicon-based NGS (Salisbury) & revealed Mean (range): JAK2 (Guy's): 33.2 (0.1-94.6), N=52; JAK2 (Oxford): 38.0 (0.5-92.2), N=52; JAK2 (Sal): 38.3 (0-90.0), N=50 (limited to JAK2 positive only). With Interclass Correlation Coefficient as follows ICC (Guy's v Oxford): 0.92 (95% CI 0.86-0.95) ICC (Guy's v Sal): 0.92 (95% CI 0.86-0.95) ICC (Oxford v Sal): 0.997 (95% CI 0.994-0.998). Notably MRs (n=5) only occurred with RUX treatment. There was no pattern of MR or progression with C/PHR or transformation, but 1 patient who transformed to PET MF had a complete MR. In a separate analysis baseline symptoms & QOL were not associated with JAK2, CALR, nor MPL status. Within RUX, baseline symptoms & QOL did not predict MR; however, fatigue, early satiety & abdominal discomfort (all p<0.05, Table 1) were significantly lower among those with MR vs not during treatment with a descriptively higher symptom response rate (2/4 [50%] vs 9/30 [30%]). Three non pre-specified multivariate analyses were performed to assess baseline factors influencing CHR (modelled for: treatment received, HC resistance or intolerance, white cell count, platelets, Hb & JAK2/CALR status); occurrence of \u2265 grade 3 anemia or thrombocytopenia (modelled for: Hb (\u2265 100g/dl) JAK2/CALR status); & transformation to PET-MF (modelled for: treatment, Hb \u2264100g/dl). Only baseline Hb \u2264100g/dl was significant for grade 3+ anemia (OR [95% CI]=0.17 [0.04, 0.72]), & PET-MF only occurred in patients with baseline WBC <10x10 9 /L. This updated analysis shows that HC resistant/intolerant ET is clinically & molecularly diverse. We confirm that these patients are at high risk of thrombosis & transformation as suggested in prior retrospective studies. Molecular responses were limited to RUX & for the first time we demonstrate such responses may correlate with symptom improvement but not always with progression events.
