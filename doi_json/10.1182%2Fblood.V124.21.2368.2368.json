    "abstract_text": "ARG (ABL2) is a member of ABL family kinases and highly homologous to ABL (ABL1) except the C-terminal domain adjacent to the kinase domain. TEL/ARG that consists of ARG fused to TEL (ETV6) has been found in AML M3, M4 or T-ALL patients, with additional chromosomal abnormalities of t(15;17)(q12;q21), inv(16)(p13;q12) or t(1;10;12)(q25;q23;p13) translocation, respectively. The structure of TEL/ARG is similar to that of TEL/ABL, which has been found in patients with T-ALL, B-ALL, AML and CML. TEL mediates homo-oligomerization of these fusion proteins, TEL/ABL and TEL/ARG, resulting in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinases. Although ABL fusion proteins such as BCR/ABL and TEL/ABL have been intensively investigated, the involvement of TEL/ARG in leukemogenesis is not fully elucidated yet. We have recently reported that in vitro transforming activity of TEL/ARG was significantly lower than that of TEL/ABL although their kinase activities were almost identical. Interestingly, the in vitro transforming activities of C-terminus-swapped mutants, TEL/ABL with C-terminal domain of ARG [TEL-ABL (ARG-C)] or TEL/ARG with C-terminal domain of ABL [TEL/ARG (ABL-C)], were comparable to those of TEL/ARG or TEL/ABL, respectively, while kinase activities in the swapped mutants were not altered. These results suggest that C-termini of ABL family kinases contain some functional domain that defines their distinct transforming activities. The purpose of this study is to compare the in vivo leukemogenic activities of TEL/ABL and TEL/ARG, and evaluate the impact of the C-terminal domains. First, we investigated whether TEL/ABL or TEL/ARG caused leukemia in mice. Each fusion gene together with GFP gene was retrovirally transduced into the bone marrow cells harvested from C57BL/6 mice treated with 5-fluorouracil, and the transduced cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated mice. Similar to BCR/ABL, transplantation of TEL/ABL-transduced cells induced rapid myeloproliferative status accompanied by hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly, and all the recipient mice died within 33 days after transplantation, indicating the development of myeloid leukemia. In contrast, the recipient mice transplanted with TEL/ARG-transduced cells did not develop myeloid leukemia but infiltrative mastocytosis, and died around 200 days after transplantation ( Figure 1 ). Hemophagocytic mast cells accumulating in the bone marrow, and mast cells circulating in the peripheral blood were also observed in these mice. Next we investigated the roles of C-terminal domains of ABL and ARG in their in vivo leukemogenic activities. C-terminus-swapped mutants, TEL/ABL (ARG-C) and TEL/ARG (ABL-C) were retrovirally transduced into bone marrow cells and the transduced cells were transplanted as described above. Intriguingly, TEL/ABL (ARG-C) mutant failed to cause myeloproliferative status or leukemia at day 153 ( Figure 2 A). On the other hand, TEL/ARG (ABL-C) induced lethal myeloid leukemia in 4 out of 13 mice (30.8%) within 111 days after transplantation ( Figure 2 B). Collectively, the in vivo phenotypes induced by TEL/ABL (ARG-C) or TEL/ARG (ABL-C) resembled those induced by TEL/ARG or TEL/ABL, respectively. Mastocytosis, a characteristic of TEL-ARG-induced phenotype, has not been observed so far in any of the recipients of TEL/ABL (ARG-C) or TEL/ARG (ABL-C). In conclusion, these results indicate that C-terminal domain of ABL family kinases defines their distinct leukemogenic activities in vivo through modulating both proliferation and differentiation. Notably, C-terminus of ARG strongly suppressed the in vivo leukemogenic activity of TEL/ABL without impairing the tyrosine kinase activity. Further clarification of the molecular mechanisms underlying the suppressive activity of C-terminus of ARG will lead to development of a novel therapeutic strategy, especially for patients with CML harboring mutations, which are resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
