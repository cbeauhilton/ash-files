    "abstract_text": "Abstract 410 Collaborative genomic profiling efforts though the National Cancer Institute's TARGET Initiative and the Children's Oncology Group have identified CRLF2 and JAK mutations in a subset of children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but few biochemical studies have assessed the functional sequelae of these genetic alterations. CRLF2 encodes the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) receptor chain, which heterodimerizes with the IL-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7R\u03b1). Children with high CRLF2-expressing ALL detected by gene expression profiling have high rates of minimal residual disease at end-induction (Day 29), and approximately 70% of these patients ultimately relapse (Harvey et al ., Blood 2010). We hypothesize that characterization of aberrant signaling networks in these leukemias will facilitate identification of potential targets for small molecule inhibitor therapies. Using phosphoflow cytometry, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of key signaling molecules after stimulation with TSLP, IL-7, or pervanadate (an irreversible proximal membrane phosphatase inhibitor used as a positive control) in 2 human ALL cell lines with CRLF2 and JAK2 mutations and in 43 fresh or cryopreserved diagnostic primary patient samples, 27 of which overexpressed CRLF2 through P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion or CRLF2 - IgH translocation and 16 of which did not have CRLF2 or JAK mutations (controls). Cells were rested in serum-free media for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C, then stimulated with TSLP, IL-7, or pervanadate for 30 minutes to induce signaling. Cells were also exposed to the JAK inhibitor XL019 (Exelixis) for 60 minutes and/or subsequently stimulated with the aforementioned cytokines or pervanadate to determine the effects of JAK inhibition on signaling. Cells were then processed for phosphoflow cytometry according to our previously published methodologies (Kotecha et al ., Cancer Cell 2008). High CRLF2-expressing leukemias (n = 27) with or without concomitant JAK mutations demonstrated strong surface staining of the TSLP receptor, as well as CD10, CD19, and CD127 (IL-7R\u03b1). In vitro stimulation of leukemic blasts with TSLP elicited phosphorylation of STAT5 and S6, but not ERK 1/2, in leukemias with JAK and/or CRLF2 alterations. Control leukemias without CRLF2 and JAK mutations (n=16) did not stain for the TSLP receptor, and TSLP stimulation did not elicit phosphosignaling through the JAK/STAT, PI3K, or MAPK pathways. STAT5 and S6 phosphorylation in the high CRLF2-expressing leukemias was further abrogated by in vitro JAK inhibition with XL019. Surprisingly, despite flow cytometric staining for CD127, stimulation with IL-7 did not elicit phosphosignaling through these epitopes in high CRLF2-expressing or control leukemic blasts, although it did predictably phosphorylate STAT5 in control T and non-blast B cells contained within the primary patient leukemia samples. These results suggest that the JAK/STAT and PI3K pathways, but not the MAPK pathway, are involved in TSLP receptor signaling in high CRLF2-expressing ALL +/\u2212 JAK mutations and may represent druggable targets. Phosphoflow cytometry is an efficient method of interrogating intracellular signaling at a single-cell level in primary human samples and, furthermore, can be used for rapid identification of patients at time of leukemia diagnosis with high CRLF2-expressing ALL who exhibit the TSLP phosphosignature. Therapy for this subset of high-risk patients might be modified to include a targeted therapeutic (such as a JAK inhibitor) to improve initial treatment responses and, ultimately, to enhance long-term survival. To this end, we have developed a Children's Oncology Group Phase I clinical trial of JAK inhibition for patients with relapsed or refractory leukemias (including those with CRLF2 and JAK mutations) and will validate the use of phosphoflow cytometry and other biologic assays to assess in vivo target inhibition during therapy. We ultimately envision incorporation of JAK inhibitor therapy into a systemic chemotherapy backbone for patients with high CRLF2-expressing ALL.
