    "abstract_text": "Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML) is an aggressive pediatric myeloproliferative neoplasm. Mutations leading to constitutive activation of the non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 (PTPN11) and/or RAS signaling are driver events. Yet, the key downstream transcriptional effectors of this aberrant signaling have not been defined. We previously found that Shp2 dephosphorylates the hematopoietic transcription factor RUNX1, leading to its activation. Overexpression of a mutant RUNX1 molecule that mimics constitutive RUNX1 tyrosine dephosphorylation in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells led to massive expansion of myelomonocytic cells and growth under low cytokine conditions. Likewise, RUNX1 is known to be activated by extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) mediated phosphorylation, which is downstream of activated RAS. To further investigate the role of RUNX1 in JMML, we analyzed gene expression datasets derived from CD34+ cells from JMML patients versus healthy controls. Thirty-four genes were down regulated and 13 were up regulated in the JMML versus control CD34+ cells using a cut-off of a log2-fold change > 0 and false-discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value \u2264 0.1. H3K27Ac and K3K4Me1 peaks located between -50 kb 5' of the transcriptional start site (TSS) to +50 kb 3' of the transcriptional end site (TES) of the differentially expressed genes were used to identify putative enhancer elements. DNA-binding factor motif enrichment analysis was then performed at these regions. This revealed a significant enrichment for RUNX DNA consensus binding sequences in the putative enhancer elements (p-value 8.05e-03). There was also significant enrichment for ETS family transcription factors, including Spi1 (PU.1) (p-values 1.94e-06 to 1.21e-03) and for Serum Response Factor (SRF) (p-value 1.11e-04). ETS factors frequently physically and functionally cooperate with RUNX transcription factors. Analysis of the proximal promoters showed only enrichment for ETS factors (p-value 2.42e-04 to 4.02e-03) and BATF::JUN (4.64e-03). Examination of ChIP-seq datasets for RUNX1 and PU.1 in CD34+ cells from healthy controls demonstrated that many of these putative sites are occupied by RUNX1, and some with PU.1. Overall, this data supports a model in which RUNX1 (and likely ETS factors) are important transcriptional effectors of aberrant cell signaling in JMML.
