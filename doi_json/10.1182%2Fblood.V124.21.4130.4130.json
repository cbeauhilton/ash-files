    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Anamorsin (AM, also called CIAPIN1) was originally isolated as a molecule that conferred resistance to apoptosis caused by growth factor deprivation. AM deficient (AM KO) mice die during late gestation; AM KO embryos are anemic and small compared to wild type (WT) embryos. It suggests that AM is indispensable for embryo growth and hematopoiesis. To determine which signaling pathways AM utilizes for these functions, we analyzed murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells generated from E-14.5 AM KO or WT embryos. Proliferation of AM KO MEF cells was markedly retarded, and PKC\u03b8, PKC\u03b4, and p38MAPK were more highly phosphorylated in AM KO MEF cells. Expression of cyclinD1, the target molecule of p38MAPK, was down-regulated in AM KO MEF cells. P38MAPK inhibitor as well as PKC inhibitor restored expression of cyclinD1 and cell growth in AM KO MEF cells. These data suggested that PKC\u03b8, PKC\u03b4, and p38MAPK activation lead to cell cycle retardation in AM KO MEF cells. However, functions of AM still remain not fully understood. In order to elucidate functions of AM, we generated AM transgenic (Tg) mice under control of CAG promoter. Since our previous study showed AM overexpression in approximately 30% of B cell type malignant lymphoma (DLBCL and FL) cases, we focused on AM overexpressed B cells from AM Tg mice in this study. Methods and Results : At first, we compared the number of B cells in the peripheral blood and spleen size between AM Tg mice and WT mice and found no difference. Next, we analyzed the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated B cells. B cells were selected from spleen by using anti-B220 antibody. The purified B cells were exposed to LPS for three days and measured. Unexpectedly, LPS-stimulated proliferation of B cells from AM Tg mice was decreased compared to WT mice. Since we initially confirmed that AM overexpression did not affect TLR4 expression on B cells, we examined TLR4 signaling pathway activation status by detecting phosphorylation of the signal transduction molecules using Western-blotting, and found that phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and IKB\u03b1 were decreased in LPS-stimulated B cells from AM Tg mice. Next, we performed cDNA microarray analysis to reveal the mechanisms of inhibition of the LPS signaling pathways by comparing the differential gene expression profiles in B cells of AM Tg and WT mice with or without LPS stimulation. We extracted 2375 genes from the data sets that met the following criteria: genes with > 2.0 fold change between LPS- vs LPS+ in AM Tg or WT mice, and secondly with >1.5 fold difference in the rate of gene expression change with LPS stimulation between AM Tg and WT mice, and performed upstream regulator analysis to predict the upstream regulators on the cascade of LPS signaling pathway with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. The data suggested that Ras activation was decreased in LPS-stimulated AM Tg B cells compared to WT B cells. Then, we confirmed the impairment of LPS induced Ras activation in AM Tg B cells using Ras activation assay kit. Furthermore, we found that AM mRNA level was increased (1.8-4.0 fold) in WT B cells at 4 hours after LPS stimulation. From these data, it was shown that AM overexpression in AM Tg B cells inhibited Ras signaling pathways and retarded the cell proliferation of LPS-stimulated B cells. Conclusion and Discussion : In our previous study, we showed that AM negatively regulates novel PKCs and p38MAPK by using MEFcells generated from AM KO mice, while in this study it was shown that overexpressed AM negatively regulates Ras signaling pathways by using AM Tg B cells. Although there are no reports other than ours that show the relationships between the signaling molecules and AM, our present data showed the novel role of AM that regulates the signaling molecules in the different manner. LPS increased AM expression via Ras activation in B cells, and AM overexpression inhibited Ras, which suggested AM might induce a negative feedback loop that attenuates Ras activation in LPS stimulated B cells. Our previous data showed that low international prognostic index (IPI) DLBCL patients with AM overexpression had a poor prognosis, especially in the patients who received chemotherapy without rituximab. In those patients, AM overexpression might contribute at least in part to chemotherapy resistance possibly through negative regulation of Ras. In summary, we showed that overexpressed AM is one of negative regulators of LPS induced signaling pathways in B cells. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
