    "abstract_text": "HCV-associated B-cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas (NHL) show distinctive clinico-pathological features such as older age, liver damage, presence of monoclonal gammopathy, increased incidence of autoimmune disorders, extranodal localizations and restricted histological subtypes. As far as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is concerned, information dealing with either characteristics or outcome of HCV-associated CLL are limited. With this background we compared clinico-hematological features and outcome of 34 HCV-positive patients diagnosed at our institution as having immunologically typical B-cell CLL (i.e., CD5+/CD23+/CD79b-/SmIg dim) with 161 unselected CLL HCV-negative patients followed-up in the last 10 years. The two groups were alike with respect to main clinico-hematological features such as age (P=0.780), sex (P=0.650), absolute lymphocyte count (P=0.788), platelet count (P=0.362), haemoglobin level (P=0.704), \u03b22-microglobulin (P=0.192), Binet stage distribution (P=0.224) and lymphocyte doubling time (LDT)(P= 0.620). As expected either ALT or AST serum levels at the time of CLL diagnosis were significantly higher in HCV-positive patients in comparison to HCV-negative ones (P<0.0001 for both). In contrast, no difference was found in the incidence of monoclonal gammopathy between HCV-positive and HCV-negative patients (10.3% versus 7.7%; P=0.708). The same applied for autoimmune disorders which were homogeneously distributed in the two subgroups (P=0.711) and accounted, more frequently, for autoimmune emolytic anemia (AEA)(HCV-negative subgroup, 5.5%; HCV-positive subgroup, 9.0%). The proportion of severe infections registered did not reflect the HCV-status (HCV-negative subgroup, 9.6%; HCV-positive subgroup 6.4%; P= 0.510). Also second tumours were equally distributed among HCV-positive and HCV-negative subgroups (10% versus 6.8%; P=0.655). Survival curves projected at 10 years did not show any statistical in terms overall survival (Hazard Risk, 0.690; 95% CI: 0.216\u20131.304; P=0.167). Finally, the short term hepatic toxicity of chemotherapy did not increase among HCV-positive patients (P=0.671). In conclusion, HCV-positive patients with B-cell CLL do not differ from other patients both for presentation and clinical outcome. The need to activate specific protocols of antiviral therapy appears less urgent in comparison to NHL, however, younger CLL patients HCV-positive who are eligible for therapies at higher immunosuppressive potential (i.e., chemo-immunotherapy) should be taken in special consideration.",
