    "abstract_text": "Abstract 642 HSCs are rare immature cells capable of reconstituting all blood cell lineages throughout the life of an individual. We have previously shown that intermittent treatment with PTH is sufficient to increase the number of HSCs in the marrow of mice. This PTH effect is blocked in vitro with inhibition of gamma-secretase, the mediator of a required step in Notch signaling. Osteoblastic cells are a critical component of the HSC niche and are likely mediators of the PTH-induced increase in HSCs. Specifically the Notch ligand Jag 1 is expressed on osteoblasts and is therefore implicated as a mechanism through which PTH acts on HSCs. Therefore we investigated in vivo the role of osteoblastic Jag 1 in the PTH-dependent increase in HSCs. We utilized the 2.3kb collagen 1 promoter driven cre recombinase to specifically excise Jag 1 from osteoblastic cells in mice (OBJag1 mice). As we previously reported treatment of wild type (WT) controls with PTH 3 times daily for 10 days resulted in a significant increase in phenotypic HSC populations including Lin-Sca1+cKit+CD48-CD150- short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs) (VEH/PTH 0.0405\u00b10.001 vs 0.0650\u00b10.0038, p\u22640.0001) and Lin-Sca1+cKit+CD48-CD150+ long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) (VEH/PTH 0.0077\u00b10.0008 vs 0.0125\u00b10.00096, p\u22640.01) as determined by flow cytometric analysis. In contrast treatment of OBJag1 mice did not result in a phenotypic increase in these populations. Despite the lack of a phenotypic increase in HSCs in OBJag1 mice, when HSC function was assessed by competitive repopulation assay, OBJag1 marrow cells demonstrated the same increased repopulating ability as WT mice (WT: VEH/PTH 12.16\u00b12.7 vs 22.32\u00b12.4, p\u22640.01, OBJag1: VEH/PTH 13.6\u00b11.8 vs 31.6\u00b15.9, p\u22640.01). Upon secondary transplantation however, HSCs from OBJag1 donors treated with PTH resulted in a lower engraftment rate than VEH treated controls (VEH/PTH 14.61\u00b13.8 vs 4.38\u00b10.9, p\u22640.05). This result suggests that osteoblastic Jag 1 is necessary for the increase in phenotypic HSCs resulting from PTH treatment and is required to maintain LT-HSC self-renewal. However these data also suggest an osteoblastic Jag 1 independent mechanism that mediates a transient increase in repopulating ability. Decreased apoptosis is a potential mechanism by which PTH may functionally increase HSCs in the absence of increased self-renewal. To determine if PTH treatment decreases the apoptosis rate of HSCs, WT mice were treated intermittently with PTH once a day for 7 days. Despite a lack of increased HSCs by phenotypic analysis at 7 days, marrow from PTH treated mice displayed an increase in LT-HSC function as measured by competitive transplantation. We determined to measure the effect of PTH on apoptotic rates of HSCs using Annexin V membrane expression. By the 7th day of PTH treatment, LT-HSC apoptotic rates were decreased in the PTH treated group (VEH/PTH 10.482\u00b12.25 vs. 6.27\u00b11.93, p\u22640.01) suggesting that changes in apoptotic rate of LT-HSCs precedes the HSC increase. These results were confirmed by flow cytometric measurement of activated caspase 3. PTH treatment decreased the percentage of LT-HSCs that were positive for activated caspase 3 (VEH/PTH 4.3\u00b10.5 vs. 2.4\u00b10.3, p\u22640.01). PTH induced micro-architectural changes in trabecular bone at day 7 of treatment suggesting bone involvement despite the lack of an increase in bone volume. These results suggest for the first time that PTH may exert its beneficial effect on bone marrow reconstitution through both Jag 1 dependent and independent effects. Additionally, HSCs demonstrate decreased apoptotic rates and increased reconstitution ability prior to a demonstrable phenotypic increase, mimicking the effect seen in the absence of osteoblastic Jag 1. Together these results suggest that the decreased apoptotic rate may be mediated by an osteoblastic Jag 1 independent mechanism. Whether osteoblasts are required for the observed osteoblastic Jag 1 independent effects remains to be seen as these effects could be mediated by a Jag 1 independent osteoblastic mechanism or by an altogether different cellular component of the HSC niche. Further, since stressful manipulation of HSCs ex vivo is essential for their use in transplantation, defining factors regulating and decreasing their apoptosis may improve their engraftment efficiency, expanding their clinical use when their numbers are limited.
