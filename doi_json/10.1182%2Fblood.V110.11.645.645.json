    "abstract_text": "Background: Ocrelizumab is a new humanised anti-CD20 antibody with the potential for enhanced efficacy in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) compared with rituximab due to increased binding affinity for the low-affinity variants of the Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor. An open-label, multicentre, dose-escalation study was conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of ocrelizumab in patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory follicular NHL following prior rituximab-containing therapy. Methods: A total of 47 pts with a response (complete response [CR], unconfirmed CR [CRu], partial response [PR]) or stable disease (SD) of \u22656 months\u2019 duration following prior rituximab-containing treatment were enrolled into 3 sequential dose cohorts. Pts received infusions of ocrelizumab q3w at 200 mg/m 2 (cohort A), 375 mg/m 2 (cohort B) and 750 mg/m 2 (cohort C) for up to 8 doses. Response was assessed after 4 doses and after the end of treatment. Results: Fifteen pts were enrolled in cohort A, 16 in cohort B and 16 in cohort C; 60% were male; mean age was 57 years; 78% had stage III/IV disease. At study entry 30%, 50% and 67% had intermediate or high FLIPI score in cohorts A, B and C, respectively. Median number of prior therapies was 2 (range 1\u20137); time to progression after last rituximab-containing therapy of <12 months: 47% (cohort A), 31% (cohort B) and 62% (cohort C) of pts. The majority of pts reported \u22651 adverse event (AE) [80\u2013100%, cohorts A-C]; most of these were grade 1/2, with only 6 pts experiencing a grade 3 AE and no grade 4 AEs observed. The most common AEs were infusion-related reactions (IRR; 73%, 75% and 69% in cohorts A, B and C, respectively); only one was grade 3. Two pts discontinued treatment due to toxicity (dyspnoea, IRR). A total of 17 pts responded to ocrelizumab for a response rate (RR) of 36% (13% CR/CRu) across all cohorts. RR by cohort was 27% (13% CR/CRu) for A, 50% (25% CR/CRu) for B and 31% (no CR/CRu) for C. In pts relapsing after prior response (CR/PR) to rituximab-containing therapy (n=40), RRs were 23% (15% CR/CRu), 62% (31% CR/CRu) and 33% (no CR/CRu) in cohorts A, B and C, respectively. Of 6 pts with SD after prior rituximab-containing therapy, 1 pt had a PR, 4 pts had SD and 1 pt progressed. Conclusion: Ocrelizumab is well tolerated at doses up to 750 mg/m 2 given q3w; AEs consist mainly of grade 1/2 IRRs. Severe IRRs (grade 3/4) following ocrelizumab occur less frequently than with rituximab. In this heavily and rituximab-pretreated pt population, the RR of 36% is encouraging.",
