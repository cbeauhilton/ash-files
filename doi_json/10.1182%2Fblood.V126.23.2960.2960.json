    "abstract_text": "Introduction : In multiple myeloma, randomized trials of maintenance therapy using thalidomide or lenalidomide following autologous transplant (ASCT) demonstrated prolonged progression-free survival (PFS), but overall survival benefit was inconsistent. The MY.10 trial (n=332) demonstrated improved PFS with thalidomide-prednisone maintenance therapy, but quality of life was inferior and overall survival was not improved. As a randomized trial with a no-treatment control arm and biospecimen collection, MY.10 provides a unique opportunity to identify predictors of benefit from therapy that could be used to personalize treatment. Immunomodulatory drug action is mediated in part through binding to cereblon (CRBN) and downregulation of IRF4. Candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from the CRBN/IRF4 pathway and other genes previously associated with myeloma prognosis, drug response and toxicity from literature review. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between candidate SNPs and benefit from immunomodulatory compound-based maintenance therapy, as well as prognostic impact. Methods : Genomic DNA was extracted from samples preserved in Trizol\u00a8. SNPs were genotyped using TaqMan\u00a8 genotyping assays on the ViiA7 qPCR platform. Analysis was performed on 187 patients with available samples and clinical data (86 in treatment arm; 101 in observation arm). Cox regression models were performed using SAS clinical 2.0 for prognostic impact of a single SNP on PFS, assessed with and without adjusted covariates (age, stage, performance status and response to ASCT). In treatment benefit analysis, PFS was modeled with genotype, treatment assignment and their interaction term. Results : SNPs with significant prognostic impact for PFS in all 187 patients were found in CRBN (rs1672753) (HR 0.59, 95%CI 0.4-0.86; p=0.006) and the following SNPs which had been found to be prognostic in prior studies were validated: CYP1A1 (rs1048943) (HR 1.98, 95%CI 1.19-3.27; p=0.008), CYP1B1 (rs1056836) (HR 0.72, 95%CI 0.52-0.99; p=0.043), and trend toward significance for SNP in CYP1A2 (rs2069514) (HR 2.02, 95%CI 0.98-4.15; p=0.057). Of these, only the CYP1A1 SNP was found to be possibly predictive of greater benefit from maintenance therapy. A SNP in ABCA1 (rs363717), previously associated with thalidomide-induced neuropathy,\u200e was prognostic in this study (HR 1.44, 95%CI 1.03-2.02; p=0.033) but not predictive of treatment benefit. Table 1 lists SNPs associated with a differential level of benefit from maintenance therapy, including SNPs in FAM179a and ICAM1 that were possibly associated with harm from maintenance therapy.

The prognostic but not predictive significance of a SNP in CRBN suggests a possible role for CRBN in multiple myeloma disease biology independent of immunomodulatory therapy. SNPs predictive of differing degrees of benefit from immunomodulatory maintenance were found in genes involved in immunomodulatory activation, drug action and cell adhesion mediated drug resistance; SNPs in FAM179A and ICAM1 were possibly associated with harm from thalidomide maintenance and could potentially be used to identify patients unsuitable for immunomodulatory maintenance therapy. These results may be applicable to lenalidomide and pomalidomide, since immunomodulatory compounds exhibit similar chemical structures and mechanisms of action. Validation of these SNPs in prospective clinical trials involving other immunomodulatory can test this hypothesis. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.
