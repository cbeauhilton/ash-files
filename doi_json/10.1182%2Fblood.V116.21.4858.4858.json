    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4858 Objectives: In the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway signaling pathway, the STAT3 is one of the most prominent predictable factors for cancer and leukemia. STAT3 activation might promote cellular transformation and therefore have an important role in human tumors. This study was aimed to investigate the relationship between the STAT3 polymorphisms and the treatment responses of AML in the Chinese population. Methods: We tested three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with 130 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and assayed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Results: The results showed there were strong relationship between unfavorable cytogenetic, partial remission (even no remission) and the frequencies of GG genotype in rs9909659 ( P =0.01 and 0.03) and the patients less than 45 years old was significant association with GA/AA genotype ( P =0.01). But associations were not confirmed about event-free survival and leukemia-free survival in the Chinese population studied. Conclusions: It is clear that the AML patients with GG genotype in rs9909659 are not sensitive to standard chemotherapy method Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
