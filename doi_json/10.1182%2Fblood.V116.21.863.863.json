    "abstract_text": "Abstract 863 Background: Patients with MM who have progressed after multiple novel agents have limited treatment options. Pomalidomide (CC4047) is the newest immunomodulatory (IMiD) agent. Pom/dex using a dose of 2 mg/day has demonstrated response rates (\u2265PR) of 63% in relapsed MM (Lacy, JCO 2009, 27:5008-5014) and 32% in a lenalidomide-refractory cohort (Lacy, Leukemia, in press). The maximum tolerated dose has been determined to be 4 mg/day for 21 of 28 days (Richardson, ASH, 2009), We opened two sequential phase II trials using the Pom/dex regimen at differing doses to study the efficacy of this regimen in patients who have failed both lenalidomide and bortezomib. Methods: Patients refractory to both lenalidomide and bortezomib therapy; defined as relapsing on or within 60 days of stopping each regimen, were enrolled. Pomalidomide was given orally 2 mg daily (Cohort A) or 4mg daily (Cohort B) on days 1\u201328 of a 28-day cycle with oral dexamethasone given 40 mg daily on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Response was assessed by the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response criteria. All patients received aspirin 325 mg daily for DVT prophylaxis. Results: 35 patients with relapsed and resistant/refractory to both lenalidomide and bortezomib were enrolled in each cohort. The median age was 62 years (range, 39\u201377) in Cohort A and 61 (range, 45\u201377) years in Cohort B. The median time from diagnosis to enrollment was 57 months for Cohort A (range 12\u2013249) and 72 months(range, 13\u2013183) for Cohort B. 15 patients had high risk molecular markers in Cohort A and 16 in Cohort B. The median number of prior regimens was 6 in both groups. The median (range) duration on treatment was 5(1-13) and 2(0-6) cycles in cohorts A and B respectively. Toxicity at least possibly attributed to drug consisted primarily of myelosuppression: grade 3/4 neutropenia (37% Cohort A vs. 55% Cohort B); grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia (11% Cohort A vs. 13% Cohort B); and grade 3/4 anemia (9% Cohort A vs. 16% Cohort B). Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities occurred in 23% Cohort A vs. 13% Cohort B. Grade 1 or 2 fatigue was the most common non-hematologic toxicity seen in 43% Cohort A vs. 52% Cohort B. Grade 1 or 2 neuropathy occurred in 17% Cohort A vs. 16% Cohort B. Other non-hematologic toxicities occurring in <5% included pneumonitis, hyperglycemia, renal failure, thrombosis. One patient in cohort B had grade 4 hepatitis. Confirmed responses in Cohort A consisted of VGPR 14%, PR 11%, and MR 24% (ORR 49%, 95% CI: 31\u201366), and responses in Cohort B consisted of VGPR 9%, PR 20%, and MR 12% (ORR 40%, 95% CI: 23\u201358). The median follow-up on alive patients was 7.5 months, and 3 months in Cohorts A and B, respectively. The median PFS in cohorts A and B are respectively 6.4 months (95% CI: 4.7-NR) and 3.3 months (95% CI: 2.3-NR). Conclusions: Pom/dex is remarkably active and well tolerated in this heavily pre-treated population of dual bortezomib/lenalidomide-refractory MM patients. The majority of patients have not progressed and objective responses (MR or better) are seen in 40\u201349%. This study confirms therapeutic benefit for Pom/dex in patients relapsing after other novel therapies. These studies do not show an advantage for the 4 mg/day on days 1\u201328 of each 28 day cycle did not show an advantage over the 2 mg/day on days 1\u201328 of each 28 day cycle.
