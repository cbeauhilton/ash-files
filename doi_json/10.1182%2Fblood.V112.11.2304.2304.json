    "abstract_text": "Background: Bone marrow is a source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in which a high proportion of CD34 + cells co-express the B cell antigen CD19. Although the influence of CD34 cell dose and graft T lymphocyte subsets on the outcome after HSC transplantation have been extensively addressed, the potential role of infused B cell subset have not been yet studied. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed B lineage-specific Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells (CD34 + CD19 + ) and B cells (immature and mature B cells, CD34 \u2212 CD19 + ) doses on transplant outcome in 85 patients (51 male, 60%) who received a non manipulated marrow graft from an HLA-identical sibling donor from January 1997 and February 2000. Cell doses were categorized according to samples tertiles and their associations with outcomes were tested in a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Median age was 35 years (19\u201342); 73 patients (86%) had hematologic malignancies. All patients received a myeloablative regimen with total body irradiation for 30 patients (35%). Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted in cyclosporine associated with methotrexate in all patients. Median number of bone marrow nucleated cells and CD34 + cells infused were 2.6 10 8 /Kg and 5 10 6 /Kg, respectively. Median number of CD34 + 19 + and 34 \u2212 19 + infused were 0.5 10 6 /Kg and 8.4 10 6 /Kg, respectively. The cumulative incidence (CI) of acute GVHD grade II to IV was 48%. The incidence of acute GVHD was inversely associated to the number of infused CD34 + CD19 + . Among patients who received less than 0.32 10 6 CD34 + CD19 + /Kg (n=28), 19 experienced acute GVHD leading to a CI of 68%. For patients who received more than 0.32 10 6 but less than 0.91 10 6 CD34 + CD19 + /Kg (n=29), 17 presented acute GVHD (CI: 54%) compared to 7 patients (CI: 22%) who received more than 0.91 10 6 CD34 + CD19 + /Kg (p=0.004). Of note, a higher but not significant rate of Treatment Related Mortality (TRM) was observed for patients who received less CD34 + CD19 + /Kg cells. Among patients who received less than 0.32 10 6 CD34 + CD19 + /Kg (n=28), the CI of TRM was 50%. For patients who received more than 0.32 10 6 but less than 0.91 10 6 CD34 + CD19 + /Kg (n=29), the CI of TRM was 35% compared to 21% for patients who received more than 0.91 10 6 CD34 + CD19 + /Kg (p=0.1). There were no statistically significant associations between B cell subsets and chronic GVHD or survival. Finally, we run a multivariate analysis to ascertain the putative role of the CD34 + CD19 + marrow cell subset as risk factor for acute GvHD. After adjustment for recipient age, female to male sex-mismatch, irradiation-based conditioning regimen, this cell subset remained significantly associated with acute GvHD (More than 0.32 10 6 CD34 + CD19 + /Kg marrow cells; Relative risk= 0.32, 95%; CI: 0.11\u20130.92, p=0.035). Conclusions: A higher graft B lineage-specific Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells (CD34 + CD19 + ) is associated with a significant decrease incidence of acute GVHD. Further studies on the specific role of those cells are needed.",
