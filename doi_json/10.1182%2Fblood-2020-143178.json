    "abstract_text": "Background Pegfilgrastim is a pegylated long-acting recombinant form of G-CSF that extends the half-life and allows for once-per-cycle dosing, requiring less frequent dosing than nonpegylated G-CSF. Aims The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of pegfilgrastim in patients affected by heavily pretreated MM, treated with pomalidomide-dexamethasone, in order to determine whether a single subcutaneous injection of pegfilgrastim is as effective as daily injections of standard filgrastim, in terms of haematological toxicity, febrile neutropenic episodes, antibiotic usage and hospedalization duration. Methods 57 patients (31 M and 26 F) were enrolled, median age at diagnosis 69 years (r. 52-84), and median age at start of treatment 76 years (r.56-90) treated with several lines of treatments (median 7, r. 2-12), every refractory to all the drugs previously received, received Pomalidomide-Dexamethasone (P 4 mg for 21 days, D 40 mg days 1,8,15,22, pegfilgrastim day +8) every 28 days, until progression. Results Since first course, received in domestic setting, with a very good compliance, patients performed blood counts once weekly and received, from day +8 to day +19, prophylactic oral chinolonic antibiotics and anti-fungal drugs. During neutropenia after first cycle, Filgrastim (5 \u03bcgr/kg/day for 3 days) was given if neutrophils count was <1500 x 10^9 cells/L. Median number of filgrastim administrations was 4.6 (r. 3-6); nadir neutropenia was registered after a median of 10.4 days (r. 7-14); median of nadir neutrophil count was 1.13 x 10^9 cells/L (r.0.3 - 1.5), with maximum duration of 14 days. From the second course, all patients switched to prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim (6 mg), injected subcutaneously with a single administration on day +3 independently from the neutrophil count at that time. During pegfilgrastim, neutropenia was never longer than 8 days, with a consequent reduction of neutropenia-related infections. Median nadir neutrophil count, evaluated for every patients for at least three courses of therapy (r. 3-6) registered at day +11, was 1.28 (r.0.9-2.2). Only 4 patients needed a supplement of 3 administrations of filgrastim. Pegfilgrastim was well tolerated in all patients: main side effects in our patients were mild fever and bone pain (21.2%). Conclusions In patients affected by heavily pretreated MM treated with pomalidomide-dexamethasone, pegfilgrastim seems to reduce the incidence of severe neutropenia and infections and may increase the possibility to maintain the scheduled time of treatment.
