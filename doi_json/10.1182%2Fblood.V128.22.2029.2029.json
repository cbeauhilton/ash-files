    "abstract_text": "During cell cycle division Aurora kinases (AURKA and AURKB) participate in the formation and control of mitotic spindle fibers, while, protein isoforms (DIDO1, DIDO2 and DIDO3), derived by alternative splicing of the DIDO gene, assist at the junction of microtubules to kinetochores. Thus, both are relevant to cell cycle maintenance. Interestingly, overexpression (or gain of function) of AURKs or low expression (or loss of function of DIDO) are both associated with centrosomal amplification and chromosomal instability (CIN), leading to aneuploidy. Among hematological diseases with CIN records, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) can display centrosome amplification and changes in AURKs expression levels leading to aneuploidy. The Despite this, there are no studies evaluating the potential association of these genes with CIN in CLL. By evaluating their gene expression levels in CLL samples from patients with or without chromosomal aberrations, we show that increased levels of AURKA and AURKB and, conversely, reduced levels of DIDO variants, are both significantly associated with chromosomal gains and with increased white blood cell (WBC) counts. Clearly, CLL samples without any cytogenetic abnormality had expression levels similar to samples mostly harboring non-numerical aberrations. The finding that the expression levels of AURKs and DIDO variants are completely opposed, showing a discrete inter-related pattern, led us to investigate the potential regulatory mechanism behind this. Given that other have previously shown that the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster is significantly upregulated in purified CLL patient cells expressing unmutated IGHV genes (as compared to mutated patient cells), and that miR-17 is expressed at significantly higher levels in unmutated or ZAP-70 high cases (bad prognostic cases generally associated with chromosomal instability), we investigated the potential negative regulation of DIDO variants by microRNAs from this cluster. In addition, based on the already described regulatory mechanism by which AURKA overexpression induces the E2F1-mediated transcription upregulation of the miR-17-92 cluster (with an observed expression correlation of both proteins in cancer specimens); we decided to investigate this regulatory axis in CLL. Notably, we found that all DIDO variants are predicted to be heavily targeted by several miRs of this oncogenic cluster. We show that CLL samples with low DIDO expression, in addition to the already mentioned AURK high levels, displayed significant higher levels of the transcription factor E2F1 and of its transcriptional target, the miR-17-92 primary transcript (MIR17HG). Moreover, by using the NTERA-2 cell line as a model, we show that siRNA knockdown of AURKA (at the transcript and protein level, as confirmed by qPCR and western blot) is accompanied by a striking significant reduction of E2F1 and also of MIR17HG. Furthermore, transfection of NTERA-2 cells with synthetic mimics of the miR-17~92 cluster (namely, miR-19a, miR-20a and miR-92a) results in a clear and significant reduction in the transcript levels of all DIDO variants. Finally, specific siRNA inhibition of the DIDO3 variant (but not the others) led to a significant reduction in the transcript levels of all DIDO variants, indicating an additional mechanism contributing to the downregulation of DIDO transcripts. Altogether, our results demonstrate the existence of a potential interconnected regulatory mechanism between AURK and DIDO, associated with CIN and higher WBC counts in CLL. More importantly, the high expression levels of AURKs and the associated low levels of DIDO variants are specifically associated with cytogenetic abnormalities presenting chromosomal gains, highlighting the specific cellular mechanism underlying the CIN observed in this distinct CLL group. Given the central role of CIN in cancer genesis and progression, these findings will likely have an important impact on prognosis or treatment of CLL. Funded by: FAPESP, CNPq and CAPES.
