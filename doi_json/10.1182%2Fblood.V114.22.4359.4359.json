    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4359 Routine serial chimerism analysis after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT) has been used as a risk factor for post-Allo-SCT cancer relapse. In non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients treated with autologous peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (APHSCT), a specific predictor during routine follow-up that could be used to ascertain risk for post-APHSCT relapse has not been identified. Thus, we set out to investigate if absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) measured at post APHSCT follow-up could serve as a marker of post-APHSCT NHL relapse. ALC was obtained at the time of confirmed relapse at follow-up and at last no evidence of relapse follow-up. From 1993 until 2005, 269 patients treated with APHSCT for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), were included in this study. Patients at last follow-up with no relapse (N=137) had a higher ALC compared with those with confirmed relapsed at follow-up post-APHSCT (N= 132) [median ALC x 10 9 /L of 1.66 (range: 0.13-3.69) vs 0.71 (range: 0.03-4.75), p <0.0001, respectively]. ALC at follow-up was a strong predictor for relapse with an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.86 (p<0.0001). An ALC of 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L was identified as the optimal cut-off point. An ALC < 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L at the time of confirmed relapse had a positive predictive value of 89% and a positive likelihood ratio of 8.4 to predict relapse post-APHSCT. Patients with an ALC \u2265 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L (N = 147) had a cumulative incidence of relapse of 19% versus 92% for patients with an ALC < 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L (N = 122) (p<0.0001) at follow-up post-APHSCT. This study suggests that ALC at follow-up can be used as a marker to assess risk of DLBCL relapse during routine follow-up after APHSCT. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
