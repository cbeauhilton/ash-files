    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Patients with limited stage aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (LS-NHL) and at least one stage-modified adverse risk factor have an excessive relapse rate leading to a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 50-77% and 10-year OS of 0-50%. In SWOG S0014 we have shown that the addition of rituximab to 3 cycles of CHOP plus involved field radiation therapy (IFRT) resulted in an improved estimated 4-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 88% and OS of 92%. Relapses were largely systemic (5 of 6 evaluable) and continued to be seen with longer follow-up. Ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin \u00ae) is a radiolabeled anti-CD20 antibody that has excellent single agent activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and could prevent systemic relapse of disease. We now report long term results of SWOG S0313, a phase II study of ibritumomab tiuxetan consolidation after 3 cycles of CHOP plus IFRT in patients with LS-NHL. Methods: Patients with LS-NHL and at least one stage-modified adverse risk factor (non-bulky stage II, age > 60 years, elevated LDH, or WHO performance status of 2) were treated with CHOP on days 1, 22, and 43, followed 3 weeks later by 40-50 Gy of IFRT. Ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen was initiated 3 \u2013 6 weeks following IFRT. Results: Forty-six patients were registered and eligible, with median follow-up of 7.3 years. Median age was 61, 37% of patients had elevated LDH, and 20% had systemic symptoms. Grade 4 adverse events occurring more than once included neutropenia (8 patients), leukopenia (5), and lymphopenia (2). Febrile neutropenia was observed in 4 patients. No cases of treatment-related myeloid neoplasms were noted. Eleven patients progressed and 8 patients died. The PFS estimate is 89% at 2 years, 82% at 5 years, and 75% at 7 years. OS estimate is 91% at 2 years, 87% at 5 years, and 82% at 7 years. These outcomes compare favorably to matched cohorts on prior SWOG trials, with 7-year PFS estimate of 68% on S0014 and 65% on S8736 (original pre-Rituximab trial); and 7-year OS estimate of 80% on S0014 and 73% on S8736 cohorts. Conclusions: Patients with high-risk LS-NHL treated with 3 cycles of CHOP plus IFRT followed by ibritumomab tiuxetan consolidation had outcomes that compare favorably to our historical experience. A US cooperative group study of R-CHOP and response-adapted IFRT followed by consolidative ibritumomab tiuxetan is ongoing.
