    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3969 Introduction: Carfilzomib is a next-generation proteasome inhibitor that selectively and irreversibly binds to its target. Phase 1 and 2 studies with carfilzomib have demonstrated durable single-agent antitumor activity with a favorable safety profile in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Results from a phase 1 study of carfilzomib in patients with relapsed and/or refractory hematologic malignancies (Alsina et al . Blood . 2007;110: Abstract 411) as well as those from an independent study of carfilzomib in the frontline combination setting (Jakubowiak, et al . Haematologica . 2011;96(2): Abstract P-253) have suggested that initial responses occur rapidly and the depth of response improves with continued treatment. Based on these encouraging findings, we have performed an exploratory analysis to evaluate the time to initial response (or the speed of response) from the following 2 multicenter phase 2 clinical trials with carfilzomib: 1) PX-171-003-A1, an open-label, single-arm phase 2 trial that enrolled patients with relapsed and refractory MM following \u22652 prior regimens and 2) PX-171-004, an open-label phase 2 trial in bortezomib-nai\u0308ve and bortezomib-treated patients with relapsed or refractory MM following 1\u20133 prior regimens. Methods: Patients in study PX-171-003-A1 received carfilzomib 20 mg/m 2 in Cycle 1 on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28-day cycle and were dose escalated to 27 mg/m 2 on the same schedule thereafter for up to 12 cycles. Patients enrolled in PX-171-004 either received 20 mg/m 2 for all treatment cycles or a stepped-up, dose-escalating regimen of 20 mg/m 2 for Cycle 1 and 27 mg/m 2 for all treatment cycles thereafter. Responses and progression were determined according to the International Myeloma Working Group criteria modified to include minimal response (MR) per European Blood and Marrow Transplant Group criteria and were assessed and confirmed by an Independent Review Committee. Responses were assessed on Day 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 12 and at the end of study. Time to response, as presented here, is the time from the start of treatment to either 1) the first confirmed response of MR or better or 2) the first confirmed response of PR of better. Results: A total of 257 response-evaluable patients from PX-171-003-A1 and 162 response-evaluable patients from PX-171-004 were eligible for inclusion in this exploratory analysis. Patients from the 003-A1 study had received a median of 5 prior anti-MM regimens, while bortezomib-nai\u0308ve patients from the 004 study and bortezomib-treated patients had received a median of 2 and 3 prior regimens, respectively. Of these, 95 patients from 003-A1 and 78 bortezomib-nai\u0308ve (both dose cohorts combined) and 11 bortezomib-treated patients from 004 had minimal responses (MR) or better and were analyzed for time to response. The specific time to response data are presented in the table below and are separated by study and by prior bortezomib exposure (ie, BTZ-nai\u0308ve or BTZ-treated) for the 004 study. Table 1 Time to Response * (mo) in Response-evaluable Patients  . PX-171-003-A1 . PX-171-004 BTZ-nai\u0308ve . PX-171-004 BTZ-treated .

At the same time, the depth of responses improved with continued carfilzomib treatment. An analysis of time to best response will be presented. Conclusions: Based on this exploratory analysis, the speed of response to single-agent carfilzomib was rapid (within a median of 0.5\u20131.0 months to achieve responses of MR or better) in patients with relapsed and refractory MM in 2 multicenter clinical trials. This preliminary analysis represents the first focused evaluation of the dynamics of response to carfilzomib and the results merit additional evaluation in the setting of ongoing and future clinical trials.
