    "abstract_text": "Protein Kinase C (PKC) are family of serine threonine kinases, known to regulate various platelet functional responses. Among them novel class of PKC isoforms (nPKC) including delta(\u03b4), theta(\ud835\udec9), eta(\u03b7), and epsilon(\u03b5) are expressed in platelets. Although, the role of nPKC \u03b5 and \u03b7 in platelets is fairly understood, not much is known about nPKC \u03b5 and \u03b7 in platelets. In this study, we investigated the role of nPKC \u03b5 in platelet functional responses using ADP-induced signaling as our stereotype. ADP causes platelet activation via Gq-coupled P2Y1 receptor and Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor. Thus, we primarily studied the role of P2Y1 receptor in nPKC \u03b5 activation. ADP activated nPKC \u03b5 in time- and concentration- dependent manner. In the presence of P2Y1 receptor antagonist MRS-2179 and in P2Y1 knockout (KO) murine platelets ADP failed to activate nPKC \u03b5, suggesting that ADP activates nPKC \u03b5 via P2Y1 receptor. We further investigated the functional role of nPKC \u03b5 using specific nPKC \u03b5 inhibitory RACK peptide (\u03b5 V1-2). \u03b5 V1-2 is a peptide designed to compete with native nPKC \u03b5 to bind \u03b5-Receptors for activated C Kinase (\u03b5-RACK) and thereby inhibits nPKC \u03b5 catalytic activity due to decreased substrate accessibility. ADP-induced thromboxane generation in human platelets pretreated with \u03b5 V1-2 peptide was more compared to the platelets pretreated with control peptide. Similarly, ADP-induced thromboxane generation in platelets derived from nPKC \u03b5 KO mouse was more compared to the wild type (WT) littermates. However, ADP- induced alpha granule secretion and aggregation in aspirin treated platelets derived from PKC \u03b5 KO mice was not significantly different from platelets derived from wild type littermates. These data suggest that nPKC e regulates an unknown pathway, which primarily regulates thromboxane generation with minimal effects on aggregation and alpha granule secretion. Furthermore, we also investigated the role of nPKC \u03b5 in PAR- and GPVI- mediated platelet aggregation and dense granule secretion. Interestingly, in both aspirin-treated and non-aspirin-treated platelets PAR- and GPVI- mediated platelet aggregation and dense granule secretion were potentiated. Consistent with ex vivo studies, FeCl3-induced arterial thrombosis was enhanced in nPKC \u03b5 KO mice compared to WT littermates.",
