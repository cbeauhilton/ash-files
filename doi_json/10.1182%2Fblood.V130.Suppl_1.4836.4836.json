    "abstract_text": "The mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) drives many functions including cellular energetics and signaling being a major determinant and indicator of cell fate. Mitochondria are considered as promising therapeutic targets because they are involved as either a cause or consequence of many chronic diseases. Previously, we reported on two novel water-soluble polyol-methanofullerenes \u0421 60 [\u0421 9 H 10 O 4 ((OH) 4 ] 6 and \u0421 60 [C 13 H 18 O 4 ((OH) 4 ] 6 that concentraion-dependently dissipate \u0394\u03a8m in Yarrowia lipolytica yeast cells (Kalacheva et al., 2015). This observation justifies further studies of those fullerene derivatives as mitochondria-targeted biological response modifiers. Here, we proceed by exploring methanofullerenols-driven individual mitochondrial responses of human whole blood platelets, lymphocytes and granulocytes ex vivo . A cytofluorimetric JC-1-based ratiometric assay was used to quantify \u0394\u03a8m in human heparinized whole blood cells using \"no lyse-no wash\" protocol minimizing activation artifacts caused by cell isolation. Briefly, heparinized blood (50 \u00b5l) obtained from healthy volunteers (n= 5) was incubated with JC-1 (20 \u00b5M final concentration, Biotium, Inc) and either 5 \u00b5l anti-CD45-PerCP (BD Biosciences) or 5 \u00b5l anti-CD31-Alexa Fluor 647 (BD Biosciences) in the presence of methanofullerenols \u0421 60 [\u0421 9 H 10 O 4 ((OH) 4 ] 6 and \u0421 60 [C 13 H 18 O 4 ((OH) 4 ] 6 (4 \u00b5M and 40 \u00b5M) for 30 min at 37 C\u00b0, 5% CO 2 . Immediately after the end of incubation 5 \u00b5l whole blood aliquots were taken up from each sample, mixed with 1000 \u00b5l CellWash buffer (BD Biosciences) and run on a FACSCalibur cytometer with a CellQuest Pro software. CD45-negative events and CD31-negative events were excluded throughout acquisition by appropriate thresholds. The normalized mitochondrial potential \u0394\u03a8m was expressed in arbitrary units as the FL2/FL1 ratio of orange (JC-1 dimers, em 590 nm) to green (JC-1 monomers, em 529 nm) fluorescence signals calculated and plotted by the Weasel v2.2.3 analysis software. Both methanofullerenols applied at concentrations of 4 \u00b5M and 40 \u00b5M after 2 h incubation period did not change \u0394\u03a8m, cell size and granularity of SSC low CD45 high lymphocytes and SSC high CD45 med granulocytes. The \u0421 60 [C 9 H 10 O 4 ((OH) 4 ] 6 methanofullerenol at concentration of 4 \u00b5M hampered by 32,5 % (P<0.01) time-dependent proapoptotic transition from CD31 + \u0394\u03a8m high platelet subset(29,8 %) to CD31 + \u0394\u03a8m low platelet subset(20,1 %). An example representative graph is shown in Figure 1. However its more hydrophobic homologue \u0421 60 [C 13 H 18 O 4 ((OH) 4 ] 6 did not prevent platelet \u03a8m dissipation. We believe that different cytoprotective activity of methanofullerenols studied is attributed to diverse structure, antioxidant potential and target cell type. Conclusively, the provided \"no lyse-no wash\" proof-of-principle protocol offers a tool for personalized diagnostics and bioenergetic therapy monitoring of mitochondrial dysfunctions in clinical settings. The \u0421 60 [C 9 H 10 O 4 ((OH) 4 ] 6 methanofullerenol appears to be a promising candidate for mitochondria-targeted prevention of apoptosis of banked platelet concentrates.

(A) Gating of intact single platelets with physiological size (FSC med CD31 + events) to exclude platelet microparticles (FSC low ), platelet-WBC and platelet-RBC conjugates (FSC high ). (B) The C 60 [C 9 H 10 O 4 ((OH) 4 ] 6 methanofullerenol (F1) did not affect platelet size and CD31 expression. (C) The normalized \u0394\u03a8m expressed as FL2/FL1 ratio in : (1) control platelets, (2) C 60 [C 9 H 10 O 4 ((OH) 4 ] 6 -treated platelets (4 \u00b5M), (3) protonophore CCCP-treated platelets (1 mM). Note bimodal \u0394\u03a8m distributions and clear-cut differences in platelet \u0394\u03a8m low-subset size.
