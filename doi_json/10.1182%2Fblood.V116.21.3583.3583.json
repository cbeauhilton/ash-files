    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3583 RelA, a classical NF-\u03baB subunit, has been shown to function critically in cellular survival and drug-resistance of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). The significance of RelB, contributing to the alternative NF-\u03baB activity, has not been addressed in B-CLL yet. The protein expression levels of NF-\u03baB subunits in 60 B-CLL samples were examined in this study. According to the RelA and RelB expression status in the nuclear extracts of peripheral blood and bone marrow, the B-CLL samples were classified as RelA + /RelB \u2212 , RelA + /RelB + , and RelA \u2212 /RelB \u2212 subgroups. The frequencies of the individual group were 30%, 30%, and 40%. In RelA + /RelB + subgroup, both the RelA DNA-binding complex and the RelB DNA-binding complex were further detected in the nuclear extracts of B-CLL cells by electrophoretic mobility super-shift assay. Fresh CD19 + B-CLL cells from different subgroups were cultured for 48 hours ex vivo , the spontaneous apoptosis were quantified by Annexin-V/PI staining and the frequencies of apoptosis were 48\u00b14.5% (RelA + /RelB \u2212 ), 24\u00b18.6% (RelA + /RelB + ), and 65\u00b15.0% (RelA \u2212 /RelB \u2212 ) individually. In addition, when fresh B-CLL cells were incubated with MG-132, a proteosome inhibitor, a significant reduction of cellular survival in RelA + /RelB \u2212 and RelA + /RelB + group was observed in a dose and time-dependent manner. B-CLL cells from RelA + /RelB + group were cultured for 0, 6 and 24 hours in the presence of CD40L (250\u03bc g/ml), the cellular survival was not affected and the protein expression levels of NF-\u03baB family members stayed unchanged. While the CD19 + B-CLL cells from RelA + /RelB \u2212 group were cultured with CD40L, a modest decrease in apoptosis and a slightly increased RelB expression in cytoplasm and nucleus after 24-hour treatment were identified. The induction of RelA and RelB expression, companied by an evident decrease in apoptosis, was detected in cells from RelA \u2212 /RelB \u2212 group. The alternative NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, in terms of RelB/p52 nuclear translocation, functions specifically in lymphoid organogenesis and B-cell development. In this study, we show that RelB expression is detected in B-CLL cells and partially maintain the basal survival. CD40L triggers the expression of RelB, correlating with the enhanced survival. Taken together, not only RelA but also RelB subunit of NF-\u03baB family plays an important role in the cellular behavior of B-CLL cells. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
