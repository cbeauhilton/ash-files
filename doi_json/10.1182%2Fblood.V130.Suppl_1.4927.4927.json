    "abstract_text": "Background: We describe a new metric ( transfusion intensity or TI ) for assessing platelet transfusion (PT) in stem-cell transplant (SCT) patients. Using this, and conventional metrics, we compare PT in different types of SCT patients. Methods: We assessed PT use in autologous- or allogeneic-SCT (auto-SCT, allo-SCT) patients in Christchurch, New Zealand between 2011 and 2015 (n = 176). PT were mainly prophylactic (trigger platelet count < 10 x 10 9 /L). Conventional metrics for PT use included: Total dose (TD) : adult doses (AD) of platelets transfused between days 0 to +180 (those dying by day +180 were included). Duration : number of days between first and last PT. Crude transfusion rate ( CTR ): TD divided by duration . A new metric is described: TI : the product of CTR and TD . This allows differentiation between PT use with overlapping features - for instance, in patients needing similar TD over different durations e.g. (a) 5 AD over 5 days versus (b) 5 AD over 10 days different TD over similar durations e.g. (b) versus (c) 10 AD over 10 days. TD, duration, CTR, and TI , respectively, would be 5, 5, 1, and 5 in (a); 5, 10, 0.5, and 2.5 in (b); 10, 10, 1, and 10 in (c). Results: Complete data was available on 173/176 patients (except for CD34 dose for which data was available on 172). Males and females were 97 (56.1%) and 76 (43.9%) respectively. Ten (5.8%), 17 (9.8%), 84 (48.6%), and 62 (35.8%) patients were respectively in age groups \u2264 20, 21 - 40, 41 - 60, and \u2265 61 years. Auto-SCT and allo-SCT, respectively, were performed in 128 (74%) and 45 (26%) patients. Of the 45 who had an allo-SCT, 23 and 22 respectively (13% and 12% respectively of the total) had either graft-host-disease (GVHD) or no GVHD. CD34 doses (x 10 6 /kg) were as follows: range, 0.9-19.4; mean [SD], 5.3 [3.0]; median [IQR], 4.6 [3.5-6.3]. Thirty one (18%), 92 (53.5%), and 49 (28.5%) had CD34 doses (x 10 6 /kg) of \u2264 3.0, 3.1-6.0, and \u2265 6.1 respectively. Auto-SCT was performed for various conditions - myeloma (76), NHL (31), and Hodgkin's disease (10) were commonest. Allo-SCT was most often performed for AML (16), ALL (7), and myelofibrosis (5). For all patients together, range, mean [SD], median [IQR] for TD were 0-55, 4 [7], 2 [1-4]; for duration , 1-177, 17 [33.1] 4 [1-10.5]; for CTR , 0-2, 2.7 [6.5], 0.7 [0.4-1]; and for TI , 0-73.8, 2.7 [6.5], 1.3 [1-2.3]. TD, duration, TI in auto-SCT patients were significantly lower than in allo-SCT patients ( P = 0.001, 0.01, and 0.0006 respectively, Wilcoxon rank sum test) though CTR was essentially similar ( P = 0.7, Wilcoxon rank sum test). TD in auto-SCT patients were \u2264 4 in 93 (72.7%) and \u2265 5 in 35 (27.3%); corresponding figures for allo-SCT patients were 22 (48.9%) and 23 (51.1%) respectively ( P = 0.003, Chi-square test). TD , duration , CTR in myeloma patients undergoing auto-SCT were significantly lower than in non-myeloma patients undergoing auto-SCT ( P = 0.003, 0.001, and 0.002 respectively, Wilcoxon rank sum test) though TI was similar ( P = 0.8, Wilcoxon rank sum test). TD , duration , CTR in patients aged \u2265 41 years were significantly lower than in those aged \u2264 40 years ( P = 0.02, 0.002, and 0.01 respectively, Kruskall-Wallis test) though TI was similar ( P = 0.9, Kruskall-Wallis test). No significant differences in any metric of PT use was found based on sex, CD34 dose, conditioning regimen (reduced intensity/myeloablative), GVHD (presence/absence), or ABO- compatibility. Conclusions: There is surprisingly little information on PT in SCT patients. A new metric of PT ( TI ) is described which may prove useful in such patients. Lower PT use was expected in auto-, compared to allo-, SCT patients but lower use in older patients, and in myeloma, compared to non-myeloma, patients undergoing auto-SCT was unexpected. However there are confounding correlations between age, myeloma, and auto-SCT. Using any metric, no differences in PT use were found based on CD34 dose, conditioning, or ABO-compatibility. In our small study we were unable to consider factors such as graft source, graft manipulation, CD34 subsets, co-morbidities, HLA-matching, and platelet refractoriness. Re-evaluation PT use in SCT patients is required. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
