    "abstract_text": "Rituximab is a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody approved in the EU (MabThera\u00ae; Roche) and US (Rituxan\u00ae; Genentech) to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). In April 2017 the first biosimilar rituximab (Truxima\u00ae; NAPP) was approved in the UK for all indications of the reference biologic. Its adoption is expected to deliver a significant reduction in treatment costs. Administration of rituximab is associated with infusion-related reactions (IRRs). The incidence of IRRs is greatest with the first infusion and decreases significantly with subsequent infusions. To reduce the risk of IRRs, manufacturers recommend that the first dose is gradually increased every 30 minutes in 50mg/hour increments to a maximum of 400mg/hour. For subsequent infusions gradually increase every 30 minutes in 100mg/hour increments to a maximum of 400mg/hour, known as standard subsequent rate infusion. This means a typical rituximab infusion can take 4-6 hours. If the first infusion is well-tolerated, it is now widespread practice to administer subsequent MabThera\u00ae doses as a rapid infusion over 90 minutes, whereby 20% of the dose is given over the first 30 minutes, with the remaining 80% over the following 60 minutes (Sehn et al, Blood 2007). Reverting to slower infusion rates with the introduction of biosimilar rituximab could adversely impact daycare unit capacity, nursing resource, appointment length, and patient satisfaction. Aim The aim of our study was to assess the safety of rapid infusion of Truxima\u00ae by reviewing infusion related adverse events in patients 1) switching from MabThera\u00ae 2) with previous exposure to MabThera\u00ae but last dose received over 6 months ago and 3) rituximab na\u00efve patients. Method In May 2017 all patients were switched from MabThera\u00ae to Truxima\u00ae at UCLH, London. Truxima\u00ae doses given between 22 nd May and 26 th July 2017 were identified from the electronic prescribing system (Chemocare\u00ae). Infusion-related reactions were noted from nursing infusion records and graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. Patients who had been receiving MabThera\u00ae as a rapid infusion continued at this rate with Truxima\u00ae. Those patients who had received only one prior dose of MabThera\u00ae at the standard first dose infusion rate received their first Truxima\u00ae dose as a rapid infusion. Patients who had not received MabThera\u00ae for over 6 months or were MabThera\u00ae na\u00efve, received their first Truxima\u00ae dose at the standard first dose infusion rate. If well-tolerated, subsequent doses were given as a rapid infusion. All patients received premedication with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and antihistamine. Results Table 1 shows the patient characteristics, MabThera\u00ae and Truxima\u00ae infusion rates and infusion-related reactions. Discussion The results showed that rapid infusion of Truxima\u00ae was well-tolerated in all three groups of patients. Additionally, patients switching from MabThera\u00ae safely received their first Truxima\u00ae dose as a rapid infusion. One patient switching from MabThera\u00ae developed tachycardia during their first Truxima\u00ae dose at rapid infusion rate; however this patient was able to receive subsequent Truxima\u00ae doses with additional glucocorticoid pre-medication without IRRs. Grade 2 or 3 IRRs were observed with 8 first rate infusions (12%) and 4 of the patients have received further Truxima\u00ae doses so far. These patients received their next dose at standard subsequent infusion rate with glucocorticoid pre-medication without incident, and 2 of the patients have had further doses as a rapid infusion without an IRR. Updated results will be presented at the ASH meeting 2017. Conclusion This study is the first reported post-marketing experience of rapid infusion of biosimilar rituximab and showed that patients can be safely switched from MabThera\u00ae to Truxima\u00ae without reverting to slower infusion rates. In addition patients who tolerated their first infusion rate of Truxima\u00ae were able to tolerate a rapid infusion rate with subsequent doses. These findings will facilitate the introduction of Truxima\u00ae at centres prescribing rituximab without adversely impacting resource utilisation or patient experience.
