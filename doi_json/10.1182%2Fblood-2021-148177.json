    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Transfusion-dependent \u03b2-thalassemia (TDT) is a severe genetic disease requiring lifelong, regular packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions and iron chelation treatment. Betibeglogene autotemcel (beti-cel) is a one-time ex vivo gene therapy that addresses the underlying cause of TDT to potentially enable lifelong, stable production of modified adult hemoglobin (Hb) sufficient to achieve transfusion independence (TI). Patients (pts) with TDT (N=63) were treated with beti-cel in 2 completed phase 1/2 studies (HGB-204, HGB-205) and 2 ongoing phase 3 studies (HGB-207, HGB-212). After 2 y of follow-up, pts could enroll in a long-term follow-up study (LTF-303 [NCT02633943]) for up to an additional 13 y. We report results from LTF-303 in pts with up to 7 y of follow-up. Methods: Pts underwent single-agent, pharmacokinetic-adjusted busulfan myeloablation and were infused with autologous CD34+ cells transduced with BB305 lentiviral vector. The phase 3 studies used a refined transduction process compared with the phase 1/2 studies. LTF-303 assessments included transfusion status, Hb, iron overload, and safety. Around the time of beti-cel infusion, pts stopped iron chelation; however, chelation could be resumed post-infusion at the physician's discretion. A subanalysis was conducted to assess iron status in pts who restarted then stopped chelation. Pts who achieved TI and had a minimum of 9 mo of follow-up after discontinuation of chelation were included in the subanalysis to assess iron parameters while off chelation. Data are reported as median (min-max) unless otherwise stated. Results: As of March 9, 2021, LTF-303 enrolled 51 pts (phase 1/2: 22 pts; phase 3: 29 pts), of which 55% were female; the median age was 19 (7-35) y. Post-infusion follow-up was 44.2 (22.9-86.5 mo; 1 pt had their Month 24 visit at 22.9 mo). TI (weighted average Hb \u22659 g/dL without pRBC transfusions for \u226512 mo) was achieved in 15/22 (68%) pts treated in the phase 1/2 studies and in 25/29 (86%) pts treated in the phase 3 studies (all during parent study); at last follow-up, all pts had remained TI for 32.2 (13.1-84.1) mo. Median (Q1, Q3) gene therapy-derived Hb (HbA T87Q ) in pts treated in the phase 1/2 studies who achieved TI was stable over time: 7.3 (5.4-8.4) g/dL at Month 24 (n=15) and 7.6 (6.6-9.3) g/dL at Month 72 (n=7). Median (Q1, Q3) HbA T87Q in pts treated in the phase 3 studies was also stable: 9.1 (8.5-10.3) g/dL at Month 24 (n=24) and 9.9 (9.8-10.0) g/dL at Month 42 (n=2). HbA T87Q helped to sustain total Hb. Total Hb was a median (Q1, Q3) of 10.0 (9.7-11.8) g/dL at Month 24 and 10.5 (10.3-12.1) g/dL at Month 72 in phase 1/2 studies and 12.1 (10.8-13.1) g/dL at Month 24 and 12.2 (11.7-12.8) g/dL at Month 42 in phase 3 studies. Pts who achieved TI (n=40) experienced reductions in iron burden over time; all pts had normal cardiac T2* levels at last follow-up and liver iron concentration (LIC) and serum ferritin were positively and strongly correlated at Months 24, 36, and 48 ( Table ). The subanalysis showed iron reduction in response to chelation and stabilization of iron markers after chelation was discontinued ( Figure ). Of the 15 pts who achieved TI in phase 1/2 studies, 10 (67%) restarted and then stopped iron chelation 25 (12-56) mo after beti-cel infusion; the 5 remaining pts continued on chelation. Of the 25 pts who achieved TI in phase 3 studies, 18 (72%) stopped iron chelation 29 (6-47) mo after beti-cel infusion; 11 (44%) pts never restarted and 7 (28%) restarted and then stopped again. Two pts in the subanalysis treated in a phase 1/2 study also received phlebotomy for approximately 20 and 56 mo post-infusion. Serious AEs occurring after 2 y in LTF-303 were reported in 8 pts (diabetic ketoacidosis, gonadotropic insufficiency, ectopic pregnancy, fetal death, cholelithiasis, gallbladder wall thickening/polyp, bacteremia with neutropenia, pulmonary embolism, and major depression; each n=1). No beti-cel-related AEs were observed beyond 2 y post-infusion. No deaths, replication-competent lentivirus, insertional oncogenesis, or malignancies were reported. Insertion site analysis indicated sustained polyclonal hematopoiesis. Conclusions: Beti-cel is a potentially curative gene therapy for pts with TDT through the ability to achieve TI with near-normal Hb levels. Sustained levels of HbA T87Q and effective restoration of iron homeostasis over time reduced iron management burden in pts treated with beti-cel.
