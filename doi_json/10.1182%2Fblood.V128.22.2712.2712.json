    "abstract_text": "Heterotrimeric G-proteins transmit signals of G-protein coupled receptors and regulate many basic cellular functions. However, their role in normal and malignant hematopoietic stem cells remains obscure. Activating mutations in the heterotrimeric G-protein Gaq were found in various cancers and its expression is enhanced in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and T-ALL. Our previous data suggested the involvement of heterotrimeric G-proteins in Flt3-ITD-mediated leukemic transformation. FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 with internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) is a frequent oncoprotein in acute myeloid leukemia causing constitutive active STAT5 signaling. Here, we investigated a novel role of Gaq in Flt3-ITD-induced leukemic transformation. We could show that Gaq is indispensable for aberrant FLT3-ITD activation and oncogenic function as Gaq activity is necessary to maintain the autophosphorylation of FLT3-ITD. Gaq abrogation resulted in diminished cell proliferation and colony formation as well as delayed leukemogenesis in vivo of Flt3-ITD leukemic cells. Importantly, the growth inhibition could be rescued by addition of IL3 and did not occur in the presence of FLT3 ligand-activated FLT3 wildtype receptor, demonstrating the specificity of Gaq requirement for FLT3-ITD oncogenic signaling. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitations revealed a direct physical interaction between FLT3-ITD and Gaq which did not require phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase. Hence, FLT3-ITD hyperphosphorylation seems to be rather a consequence of the interaction than a prerequisite. Flt3-ITD-induced transformation of murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) strictly depended on the presence of Gaq, and the ablation of Gaq/11 in transplanted Flt3-ITD-transduced HSPCs from conditional Gaq/11 double knock-out mice delayed leukemic burden. These findings of an unexpected, yet critical, role of Gaq place the molecule as an important target for antileukemic strategies. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
