    "abstract_text": "Calreticulin ( CALR ) exon 9 mutations were reported in about two-thirds of JAK2 or MPL mutation negative ET and PMF patients. The mutations cause frameshifts that result in proteins with novel C-terminus.Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into cell lines and mouse bone marrow (BM) cells is a common technique, but the expression level is very high compared to the physiological expression.We investigated the effects of physiological expression of mutant CALR using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing techniques for cell lines, and as for the mouse model, we generated a transgenic mice (TG) expressing human CALR del52 mutant. We used two human cell lines expressing MPL: human acute megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line CMK11-5 which expressed endogenous MPL, and F-36P-MPL cell line which was generated by introducing MPL to GM-CSF-dependent erythroleukemia cell line F-36P. Plasmids coexpressing hCas9 and single-guide RNA were prepared by ligating oligonucleotides (5'-CACCGACAAGAAACGCAAAGAGGAGG-3', 5'-AAACCCTCCTCTTTGCGTTTCTTGTC-3') for the target sequence of human CALR exon 9 into pX330. The plasmids were introduced with a electroporator to each of the cell lines. After limiting dilution cloning, we identified cell lines which have indel mutation at the target site. We produced two types of CMK11-5 subline knocked in a CALR mutation, namely CALR del25 CMK cells and CALR del25/del17 CMK cells, respectively. The former lacks 25 bases in one CALR allele, causing a frameshift that results in a protein resembling human CALR mutant, while the latter lacks an additional 17 bases in another allele in CALR exon 9 and induces a frameshift that causes a deletion in CALR exon 9. Both kinds of CALR mutant CMK11-5 cells showed increased cell proliferation compared to WT cells. We also produced one type of F-36P-MPL subline, CALR del1/ins1 F-36P-MPL cells which had 1 base deletion in one CALR allele resembling human mutation and 1 base insertion in another allele. Though the growth of this subline in the presence of GM-CSF was comparable to WT cells, it showed GM-CSF independent autonomous cell growth. We generated TG mice expressing human CALR del52 mutant driven by the murine H2K b promoter. We compared the expression level of human CALR mRNA in TG BM cells with the expression of endogenous WT CALR in human cell lines (CMK11-5, F-36P-MPL, CHRF288) using Rn18s as an endogenous control. The expression of human CALR in TG BM was approximately 0.6 times that of endogenous WT CALR in human cell lines, and the physiological expression level was obtained. They exhibited thrombocytosis, with platelet (PLT) counts as high as 2,000 x 10 9 /L. Leukocyte number and the proportion of granulocytes and T and B lymphocytes, were comparable to WT mice. CALR mutation had no impact on Hb level or spleen weight. There was a striking difference in the number of megakaryocytes (Mgks), which was 2-fold higher in BM from TG mice than in WT mice. The TG Mgks were also more mature, with larger diameter, and contained higher number of alpha-granules compared to WT cells. In one year of observation, there is no fibrosis in BM. These observations showed that TG developed human ET-like disease. The survival of TG mice was comparable to that of WT mice. The disease phenotype was transplantable into WT recipient mice. To characterize in detail the impact of MPNs induced by the CALR del52 mutant, we evaluated the frequencies of HSCs and progenitors in BM. The frequency of both LT-HSC and ST-HSC in BM was higher inTG mice compared to WT mice. The frequencies of progenitors (CMP, MEP, and MKP) were also greater in BM from TG mice than from WT mice. However, BM cells did not have enhanced replating capacity. We next examined whether or not ruxolitinib (RUX) treatment ameliorated thrombocytosis in TG mice. Either 90 mg/kg bid of RUX or vehicle was administrated to TG mice for 4 weeks.TG mice treated with vehicle showed a mean 16% increase in PLT count during the treatment period, probably due to the disease progression. RUX treatment attenuated the increase in the number of PLTs in TG mice by a mean of 22%, but the overall count was still higher than that in WT mice. BM sections showed that RUX reduced the Mgks number in TG. In summary, physiological expression of CALR mutant increases cell growth and cytokine independency in human cell lines expressing MPL, and develops ET in mice. RUX therapy attenuated the increased numbers of peripheral blood PLTs and BM Mgks, and ameliorated CALR mutation-induced ET. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
