    "abstract_text": "We have reported that rituximab triggers and inhibits anti-apoptotic gene products in NHL B-cell lines resulting in sensitization to drug-induced apoptosis ( Alas et al., Clin. Cancer Res.  8 : 836 , 2001 ; Jazirehi et al., Mol. Cancer Therapy  2 : 1183 , 2003 ; Vega et al., Oncogene  23 : 3530 , 2004 ). This study investigated whether rituximab also modifies intracellular signaling pathways resulting in the sensitization of NHL cells to Fas-induced apoptosis. Treatment of the NHL cell lines (2F7, Ramos, and Raji) with rituximab (20 \u03bcg/ml) sensitized the cells to CH-11 (FasL agonist mAb) -induced apoptosis and synergy was achieved. Fas expression was up-regulated by rituximab as early as 6 h post treatment as determined by flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and Western. Rituximab inhibited both the expression and activity of the transcription repressor Yin-Yang 1 (YY1) that negatively regulates Fas transcription. Inhibition of YY1 resulted in upregulation of Fas expression and sensitization of the tumor cells to CH-11-induced apoptosis. Downregulation of YY1 expression was the result of rituximab-induced inhibition of both the p38MAPK signaling pathway and constitutive NF- \u03baB activity. The dual roles of NF-\u03baB and YY1 in the regulation of Fas expression were corroborated by the use of a dominant-active inhibitor of NF- \u03baB (Ramos I\u03baB-ER mutant) and YY1 siRNA, respectively. The role of rituximab-mediated inhibition of the p38MAPK/NF- \u03baB/YY1 pathways, which result in both Fas upregulation and sensitization to CH11-induced apoptosis, was corroborated by the use of specific chemical inhibitors directed at various targets of these pathways. Rituximab-mediated sensitization to CH-11-induced apoptosis was executed through the Type II mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Altogether, these findings provide a novel mechanism of rituximab-mediated signaling by inhibiting the p38MAPK/NF- \u03baB/YY1 pathways and resulting in the sensitization of B NHL to Fas-induced apoptosis. These findings may have significant clinical implications and suggest an additional mechanism of rituximab-mediated effect in vivo in addition to CDC and ADCC.",
