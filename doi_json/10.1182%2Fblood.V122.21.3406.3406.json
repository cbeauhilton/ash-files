    "abstract_text": "Introduction Allogeneic transplantation is the only curative option for patients with high risk hematologic malignancies. HAPLO-HSCT offers a therapeutic option to most of these patients with the advantages of quick availability, easy programation and logistics, and a committed donor. This procedure has shown promissing results in patients diagnosed with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin\u00b4s disease (Burroughs LM et al. Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 2008; 14:1279-1287). Patients and Methods We retrospectively evaluate the results of HAPLO-HSCT with RIC regimens (Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 x5 days (-6 to -2), Cyclophosphamide14,5 mg/kg x2 days (-6 to -5), Busulfan IV 3,2 mg/kg x 1-2 days (BUX, days -3 to -2) or 200 cGy TBI on day -1) and GVHD prophylaxis based on HD-CY (50 mg/kg on days +3 and +4) and a calcineurin inhibitor plus mycophenolate from day +5 performed in GETH centers to patients diagnosed with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin\u00b4s disease. Results From March-2009, 29 HAPLO-HSCT have been performed in patients diagnosed with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin\u00b4s disease in 11 GETH centers. Median age was 31 years (18-53), 19 were males and all were in advanced phases of their disease. Autologous HSCT was previously employed in 90% of them, and allogeneic HSCT in 10%. Disease status at HAPLO-HSCT evaluated by PET was complete remission in 8 (28%) and persistent disease in 21 (72%). Bone marrow was the stem cell source in 15 (52%) and peripheral blood in 14 (48%), without T-cell depletion in all cases. The haploidentical donor was the patient\u00b4s mother (13), father (2), brother (8), sister (5) or daughter (1). The RIC regimens employed included 1 dose BUX (11), 2 doses BUX (14) or 200cGy TBI (4). Median neutrophils engraftment was day +17 (11-44) and platelets >20K was day +26 (11-150). Main toxic complications were grade II-III muchositis in 50%, febrile neutropenia in 75% and CMV reactivations in 58% with a transplant related mortality rate of 7% (2/29) at day +100 and 17% (5/29) at 6 months post-transplant. Acute GVHD grade II-IV affected to 7/28 patients at risk (25%), with grade III-IV in 3/28 (11%). Chronic GVHD was present in 3/19 (16%), being extensive in 1/19 (5%). After a median follow-up of 9 months (0.3-49), 13/22 (59%) remain alive and in complete remission. Relapse or progression occured in 6/28 (21%). Immune reconstitution was fast and complete in those evaluated. Conclusions HAPLO-HSCT with HD-CY is a useful tool in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin\u00b4s disease, rendering long-lasting remissions with limited toxicity, low GVHD incidence and early immune reconstitution.
