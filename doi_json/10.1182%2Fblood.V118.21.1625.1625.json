    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1625 Background: In the previous study, we demonstrated the efficacy and safety of dose-intensified CHOP (Double-CHOP) followed by consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) for high-risk aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Yamazaki et al. Leuk Lymphoma 43: 2117\u201323, 2002). However, after the advent of rituximab, the role of intensive chemotherapy or consolidating HDC for patients with high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in primary treatment has been controversial. We therefore investigated the significance of combination chemotherapy consisting of rituximab and Double-CHOP (R-D-CHOP) followed by consolidating HDC for younger patients with advanced DLBCL. Patients and methods: 65 years or younger patients with newly diagnosed CD20-positive DLBCL who had 2 or more risk factors in the age adjusted International Prognostic Index (aaIPI = 2, 3) were enrolled in this study. To prevent tumor lysis syndrome, a standard dose of CHOP was given 3 weeks before initiating R-D-CHOP. R-D-CHOP consisted of rituximab (375 mg/m 2 on day\u22122), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m 2 on day 1, 2), doxorubicin (50 mg/m 2 on day 1, 2), vincristine (1.4 mg/m 2 [maximum 2.0 mg/body] on day 1) and prednisolone (50 mg/m 2 on day 1\u20135). For patients aged 61\u201365 years, dosage of cycrophosphamide was reduced. Treatment was given every 3 weeks up to a total of 3 courses with support of granulocyte colony stimulating factor. For responders with good performance status (PS), we planned peripheral stem cell collection after the third cycle of R-D-CHOP with in vivo purge using rituximab and consolidating HDC with cycrophosphamide (60 mg/kg on day\u22127,\u22126), etoposide (500 mg/m 2 on day\u22126,\u22125,\u22124) and ranimustine (250 mg/m 2 on day\u22123,\u22122) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). For poor mobilizers or patients with poor performance status, high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) (8 g/m 2 on day 1) with leukovolin rescue was alternatively given. Results: From January 2001 to November 2010, 51 patients with a median age of 54 years (range 19 \u2013 65) participated in this study. All the patients had Ann Arbor stage III (n = 13) or IV (n = 38) disease with an average 1,005 IU/l of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration (normal upper limit = 220), and 26 (51%) had bulky disease. Of these patients, 49 completed the intended 3 cycles of R-D-CHOP with a median 22 days (range 19 \u2013 62) of interval. The overall response (OR) and the complete response (CR) rate for R-D-CHOP regimen were 94% and 78%, respectively. Of the responders, a total of 30 patients successfully proceeded to HDC/ASCT with an average 4.57 \u00d7 10 6 /kg of harvested CD34-positive cells and a median 11 days to neutorophil engraftment (range 9 \u2013 15), whereas 16 received HDMTX. Throughout initial treatment, 17 patients who had residual or suspicious disease received additional irradiation therapy before or after consolidating chemotherapies. With a median 38 months (range 3\u2013119) of follow up, the 3-year overall survival (OS) and the event-free survival (EFS) for all patients were 78% and 61%, respectively. 3-year OS for patients treated with HDC/ASCT and HDMTX were 90% and 72% (p = 0.49), respectively. Overall, Grade 3 \u2013 4 hematological toxicities were common, but no treatment-related death was observed during the observation period. Conclusion: R-D-CHOP regimen, \u2013 followed by consolidating HDC/ASCT or HDMTX \u2013, is a safe and efficacious treatment for younger patients with advanced DLBCL. In addition, HDMTX seems to be a reasonable alternative for patients who are not candidates for HDC/ASCT. Although these results need further evaluation, our data suggest that up-front HDC remains to be a promising strategy for a highly unfavorable subgroup of patients with DLBCL in the rituximab-era.
