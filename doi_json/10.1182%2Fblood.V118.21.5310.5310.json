    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5310 Once dismissed as an inert byproduct of nitric oxide (NO) auto-oxidation, nitrite (NO 2 \u2212 ) is now accepted as an endocrine reserve of NO that elicits a number of fundamental biological responses in all major organ systems. While it is known that tissue nitrite is derived from both oxidation of NO and from dietary nitrite and nitrate, much less is known about how nitrite is metabolized by tissue or about the factors that influence this metabolism. Here we investigate the rates and mechanisms by which nitrite is metabolized by tissue over a range of oxygen tensions in rats and mice. We show that the rate of nitrite metabolism differs in heart, liver, lung and brain tissue. Further, oxygen regulates the rate and products of nitrite metabolism in each of these tissues. In hypoxic tissue, nitrite is predominantly reduced to NO, with significant formation of iron-nitrosyl heme proteins and S-nitrosothiols. Interestingly, this hypoxic nitrite metabolism is mediated by different sets of nitrite reductase enzymes in each tissue. In contrast, tissue consumption of nitrite is more rapid in normoxia and the major end product is nitrate. While cytochrome P450s and myoglobin contributed in the liver and heart respectively, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase played a significant role in this normoxic nitrite oxidation, which could be completely inhibited by cyanide in all tissues. We used cyanide-based nitrite preservation solution to measure the pharmacokinetics of oral and intraperitoneally administered nitrite in vivo . Using this methodology, we measured basal levels of nitrite in the major tissues and confirm that the heart contains the greatest concentration of nitrite, followed by the liver and finally the lung. We demonstrate that intraperitoneal administration of nitrite to mice increases nitrite levels most significantly in the liver and heart, where nitrite uptake is rapid (5\u201310 min) and steadily decreases thereafter, such that levels are back to baseline by 30 min. Little to no increase was observed in the lung. In these studies, changes in nitrate were difficult to detect due to the high levels of basal nitrate present in vivo and low concentration of nitrite administered. However, the rapid metabolism of nitrite in the tissue suggests that oxidation is at least partially responsible. In contrast to intraperitoneal nitrite, oral nitrite increased nitrite levels in all organs of mice, an effect which peaked in all organs except liver at 3 days. Collectively, these data provide insight into the fate of nitrite in tissue, the enzymes involved in hypoxic and normoxic nitrite metabolism and the role of oxygen in regulating these processes.
