    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1506 BACKGROUND: A wide range of neuropsychological sequelae, noted in long-term survivors of ALL, have been in part ascribed to cranial irradiation (CRT), especially in children who are more vulnerable than adults. We had attempted to abandon prophylactic CRT by intensifying systemic chemotherapy and protracted triple IT (TIT) in ALL-02 trial; whereas one third of patients received CRT for CNS directed therapy in the former study (ALL-97). We present here the results of JACLS ALL-02 trials especially about the effect of the CNS-directed therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2008, 1139 children with newly diagnosed non-T ALL with 1\u201318 years of age were enrolled to JACLS ALL-02 trial. Patients with Ph+ALL and T-ALL were registered to independent protocol. The criteria for diagnosis of CNS disease of the JACLS ALL-02 trial were defined as a CSF pleocytosis of > 5 cells /microL and the presence of recognizable blast cells on a well-stained cytospin preparation, or the presence of cranial-nerve palsies at a diagnosis of leukemia. Treatment group was divided into 3 groups according to the BFM-style initial prednisolone (PSL) response and the modified National Cancer Institute (NCI) workshop criteria. PSL good responders were divided into standard risk (SR) and high risk (HR) by WBC 10,000 and age 10. BCP-ALL with PSL poor responders and acute mixed lineage leukemia/ acute unclassified leukemias were treated in extremely high risk (ER). The SR patients with unequivocal CNS involvement (CNS3) at diagnosis were treated as an HR group. The patients in M1 marrow at day 33 with M2/M3 at the day 15 bone marrow (BM) were assigned to shift higher risk after induction therapy. Treatment of ALL-02 consists of early phase and maintenance phase. Early phase includes induction, consolidation, sanctuary (2 courses of high-dose MTX at a dose of 3g /m 2 ), and re-induction therapy for 15 to 26 weeks depending on risk group. Prophylactic CRT was replaced by protracted TIT (MTX, CA, HDC) in all except the patients with CNS3 at diagnosis in ALL-02 trial. The patients with CNS3 at diagnosis received CRT at a dose of 12 Gy. Depending on the risk group, protracted TIT was given during induction, intensification and maintenance in ALL-02 (12 doses in SR and 15 in HR/ER). Accumulative doses of DEX were 120 mg/m 2 in SR, whereas 170 mg/m 2 in HR and 670 mg/m 2 in ER. Treatment duration is 24 months for any risk. The patients assigned ER were candidate for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) by the end of early phase, provided HLA-matched siblings were available. The probability of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Events in the analysis of EFS included induction failure, death, relapse and secondary malignant neoplasm. All statistical analyses were done according to intent-to treat methods. RESULTS: The numbers of patients at each risk in ALL-02 were 457 (40%) for SR, 543 (48%) for HR, and 139 (12%) for ER. The number of patients with CNS3 at diagnosis was 31 (2.7%). Of 1139 patients, 16 patients (1.4%) had CNS relapses of the leukemia (an isolated CNS relapse: 10 pts, a combined CNS and BM relapse: 6 pts). The 5-year EFS rate ALL-02 was 83.7% (SE=1.1), slightly better than for ALL-97 (79.3%, SE=1.7, p =0.054). The 5-year cumulative risk of an isolated and total CNS relapse was lower in ALL-02 than in ALL-97 (isolated CNS relapse: 0.9% vs 2.7%, p=0.017, total CNS relapse: 4.5% vs 1.4%, p =0.01). The proportion of CRT and SCT were 2%, 8% in ALL-02 respectively, whereas 31%, 11% in ALL-97 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ALL-02 trial found that CRT was abolished successfully, in all except those with CNS3 at diagnosis, with substitution of more intensive systemic chemotherapy and protracted TIT.
