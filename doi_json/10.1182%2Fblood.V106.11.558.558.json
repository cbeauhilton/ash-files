    "abstract_text": "For more than 40 years, hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) caused by anti-Rh(D) antibody produced by a pregnant mother to her Rh(D) + baby has been prevented by Rh(D)-immune globulin prophylaxis. Surprisingly, although a number of theories have been proposed, the mechanism of action of this immunosuppressive treatment remains completely unknown ( Kumpel BM, Immunol Lett.  2002 ; 82 : 67 \u201373 ). One potential mechanism of action is the production of one or several strongly immunosuppressive cytokines capable of blocking a primary immune response. Thus, to begin to unravel the possible mechanism(s) of the immunosuppression induced by administration of Rh(D)-immune globulin, we have examined production of a number of immunomodulatory cytokines following administration of Rh(D)-immune globulin. After informed consent, we measured levels of 17 different cytokines pre- and 48 hours post-administration of 300 \u03bcg of anti-Rh(D)(WinRhoSDF) in 10 healthy women candidates for Rh(D)-immune globulin prophylaxis. We used platelet-poor plasma from citrated whole blood and quantitative ELISA having the most sensitive detection limits. We observed no striking changes in levels of the cytokines IL-1 sRII, IL-12 p40, IL-16, or MCP-1. Levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, MIP-1\u03b1, GM-CSF, TNF\u03b2, and IFN\u03b3 remained below detection levels both pre- and post-testing. However, IL-1ra levels showed a slight to moderate decrease in 7 of 10 women after Rh(D)-immune globulin administration. In contrast, levels of TGF\u03b2-1 increased, >1.3-fold in 7 of 10 women and >2-fold in 4 of 10 women. In one instance, the increase in TGF\u03b2-1 (42, 855 pg/mL) was >5-fold and this woman also had a significant increase in TGF\u03b2-2 (352 pg/mL). In addition to TGF\u03b2, 4 of 10 women had increases of >1.5-fold in PGE 2 . Statistical analyses using ANOVA, paired Student\u2019s t -test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank, for the combined results of all 10 women receiving Rh(D)-immune globulin indicated that only TGF\u03b2 and PGE 2 were significantly elevated post administration of Rh(D)-immune globulin. These results indicate that Rh(D)-immune prophylaxis can induce high levels of the strongly immunosuppressive cytokines TGF\u03b2 and PGE 2 . Both of these molecules have been shown to induce profound immunosuppression including prevention of primary immune responses ( Ludviksson BR, et al., Eur J Immunol.  2000 ; 30 : 2101 \u20132111 ; Zhou H, Lamont SJ, Int J Fertil.  1986 ; 31 : 305 \u2013310 ). Our findings represent the first clear evidence for a mechanism of action of Rh(D)-immune prophylaxis.",
