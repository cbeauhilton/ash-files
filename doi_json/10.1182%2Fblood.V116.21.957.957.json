    "abstract_text": "Abstract 957 Introduction: Various approaches to induce immunological rejection of tumors including transfer of autologous tumor infiltrating lymhocytes (TIL) after ex vivo clonal expansion or application of ex vivo transduced antigen specific T cell (TCR) transgenic T cells have been elaborated. In general, adoptive T cell transfer (ATC) has been combined with lympho-depleting agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide). However, the therapeutic efficacy of these cancer immunotherapy approaches is limited due to insufficient in vivo activation, expansion and survival of transferred effector immune cells, which is mainly due to suppressive mileu signals and immune evasion mechanisms induced by TGF-\u03b2. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b is a key regulator of T cell activation and is assumed to confer TGF-\u03b2 resistance. Thus we performed a proof-of-concept study evaluating Cbl-b targeting as \u201cintracellular adjuvant\u201d strategy to improve ATC for cancer immunotherapy. Material and Methods: We first tested the in vitro sensitivity of CTL towards TGF-\u03b2 mediated immuno-suppressive cues and then in vivo evaluated the anti-tumor reactivity of cblb- deficient cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in murine tumor models alone or in combination with a dendritic cell (DC) vaccine. Results: Cblb -deficient CTL are hyper-responsive to TCR/CD28-stimulation in vitro and protected from the negative cues induced by TGF-\u03b2 as determined by quantification fo IFN-g secretion and quantification of their proliferative capacity. Unexpectedly, adoptive transfer of polyclonal, non TCR-transgenic cblb -deficient CD8+ CTL, however, is not sufficient to reject B16ova or EG7 tumors in vivo , which is in clear contrast to previous reports using lymphopenic animals receiving adoptively transferred TCR-transgenic T cells. Thus, we next evaluated in vivo re-activation of adoptively transferred cblb -deficient T cells by a DC vaccine (i.e. SIINFEKL-pulsed DC). In strict contrast to ATC monotherapy, this approach now markedly delays tumor outgrowth and significantly increase survival rates, which is paralleled by an increased CTL infiltration rate to the tumor site and an enrichment of ova-specific and IFN-g-secreting CTL in the draining lymph nodes. Moreover, compared to wild-type CTL, cblb- deficient mice vaccinated with the DC vaccine show an increased cytolytic activity in vivo . Conclusions: In summary, we provide experimental evidence that genetic inactivation of cblb in polyclonal, non-TCR transgenic adoptively transferred CTL might serve as a novel \u201cadjuvant approach\u201d, suitable to augment the effectiveness of anti-cancer immunotherapies using ATC in immune-competent recipients.
