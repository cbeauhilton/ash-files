    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3098 Poster Board III-35 In a subset of AML with a normal karyotype, a frame-shift mutation in the extreme C-terminal of the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene results in the creation of a nuclear export signal, generating a mutant NPM protein (NPMc) that is permanently dislocated in the cytoplasm. In the present study, we have analyzed the interaction between NPMc and a cytoplasmic subcomplex of Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins. Sequence analysis of bone marrow samples from 46 FA patients shows that NPMc mutations were excluded from FA genome. NPMc was degraded more rapidly in AML bone marrow cells from FA patients ( t 1/2 < 30 min) than in AML cell line HL60 ( t 1/2 > 90 min). Further analysis revealed that inducible knockdown of FANCA or FANCC in leukemic OCI/AML3 cells carrying the NPMc mutation induced degradation of the cytoplasmic NPMc protein. Forced localization of FANCC to the nucleus also caused rapid NPMc degradation. We also show that NPMc degradation was mediated by the proteasome and that correction of mutant lymphoblasts from FA-A or FA-C patients with a functional FANCA or FANCC protein prevented NPMc ubiquitination and consequently degradation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic FANCA and FANCC interacted with NPMc in the cytosolic fractions of normal human lymphoblaststic cells and that the acidic domains of NPM were required for the cytoplasmic FA-NPMc complex formation. Finally, using patient-derived FANCC mutant, a nuclearized FANCC and a NOG/SGM3 xenotansplant model, we present evidence that the cytoplasmic FANCA-FANCC complex was essential for NPMc stability and biological function. Thus, these findings reveal the potential molecular mechanism involved in the cytoplasmic retention of the leukemic NPMc. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
