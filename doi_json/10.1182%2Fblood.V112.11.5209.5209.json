    "abstract_text": "The management of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients who have failed older conventional and more recent novel agents remains challenging. Patients typically have short response duration, develop prolonged cytopenias and are usually not eligible for clinical trials due to inadequate bone marrow reserve. Furthermore, these patients often have inadequate numbers of stem cells ( 2000 and platelets > 50,000/mcl. The median duration of response exceeded 2 months. All patients were able to proceed on to new clinical trials. We conclude that the combination of bortezomib and melphalan produces an effective salvage strategy, with hematopoietic reconstitution in RRMM. This non-myeloablative approach serves as a bridge for disease control and hematopoietic reconstitution to allow for subsequent eligibility on clinical trials. We recommend that during stem cell collection that sufficient hematopoietic stem cells be stored to support future myeloablative and similar non-myeloablative chemotherapy regimens.",
