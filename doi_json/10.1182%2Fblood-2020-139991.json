    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary disorder occurring due to a mutation in the \u03b2- globin gene resulting in hemoglobin polymerization and sickling of red blood cells that drives an array of severe pathophysiologies. SCD patients with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin mutations show amelioration of disease symptoms. HRI is a heme sensing eIF2\u03b1 kinase belonging to the integrated stress response pathway, primarily regulating the hemoglobin synthesis in RBCs. Under low levels of heme, HRI undergoes auto-phosphorylation and subsequently phosphorylates its substrate eIF2\u03b1. This impedes the global protein translation and selectively activates ATF4 translation thereby initiating a transcriptional stress response. HRI protein deletion has been shown to induce fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in vitro by reducing BCL11A levels (Grevet et al., 2018). It has also been shown that ATF4 binds to enhancer region of BCL11A promoting its expression, revealing a direct regulation of HRI from eIF2\u03b1 to ATF4 to BCL11A to \u03b3-globin (Huang P, 2020). As it is well-established that protein kinases can exert dual kinase and scaffold functions, we explored whether the regulation of HRI on HbF is driven by its catalytic or non-catalytic activity. We generated HRI kinase dead (KD) mutant HUDEP-2 cells, with a mutation (K196R) in HRI ATP binding site that is predicted to result in loss of its auto-phosphorylation (Bauer B. N., 2001). HRI KD mutant HUDEP-2 was created using CRISPR Cas9 and homologous recombination approach, followed by clonal selection that yielded two homozygous clones, referred as KD clones. To further compare the scaffold and kinase function of HRI, we created HRI knockout (KO) in HUDEP-2 cell line using CRISPR Cas9 approach. We isolated clonal populations with 3 clones each with heterozygous and homozygous editing. Western analysis of KD clones showed that HRI protein levels remain unchanged. About 50% and a 100% loss in HRI protein level was observed in heterozygous and homozygous KO clones respectively. To confirm the loss in kinase activity of HRI, we differentiated KD clones for 7 days in vitro and subjected them to iron depleted conditions. As expected, HRI WT cells under iron depleted conditions showed robust activation in the p-eIF2\u03b1 levels indicative of increase in HRI activity. KD clones lacked increase in p-eIF2\u03b1 levels under these conditions confirming the loss of kinase activity of HRI in KD clones. HRI KD and KO clones were characterized to evaluate the HbF regulation by differentiating in vitro for 7-8 days. KD clones showed 4-5-fold induction in HbF levels measured by flow cytometry. Heterozygous and homozygous KO clones showed an equally strong activation in HbF levels. KD and KO clones showed downregulation in BCL11A and ATF4 protein levels. These results indicate that HRI regulates HbF as a function of its catalytic activity. We further employed RNA-seq to study the global transcriptomics in HRI WT and KD mutant clones at day 0 and day 8, under steady state and iron depleted conditions. RNA-seq confirmed the strong activation of HBG1/2 levels and robust silencing of BCL11A levels in KD clones at day 8. A weaker induction in HBG1/2 levels and minor reduction on BCL11A levels were observed at day 0. These results indicate that HRI may play a role in HbF silencing in a stage specific manner. HRI WT cells under iron depleted condition showed activation of ATF4 pathway, indicative of activation of HRI stress pathway. As expected, HRI KD population showed no regulation of ATF4 pathway under iron depleted conditions. Interestingly, we did not observe any changes in the BCL11A gene expression in WT cells under iron depleted conditions. Further evaluation needs to be carried out in order to understand the regulation of BCL11A by ATF4 under low iron mediated stress. Fewer gene changes were observed in KD populations under iron depleted conditions indicative of HRI playing a vital role as a heme sensor. Overall, our results provide evidence to support that HRI regulates HbF though its catalytic activity and demonstrates its role as heme sensor in HUDEP-2 cells.
