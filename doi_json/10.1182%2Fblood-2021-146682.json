    "abstract_text": "Introduction Anemia, including Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), is a prevalent public health crisis around the world. In IDA, red blood cells are unable to oxygenate tissues in the body due to the lack of essential iron. India has had a particularly high consistent prevalence of IDA since the National Family Health Survey began in 1991. Other forms of anemia can arise due to a lack of vitamin B12, folic acid, and other micronutrients that make up hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying in red blood molecules. The villages of Dhank, Kolki, and Bhimora in the state of Gujarat, India have not been focused on in great depth for the prevalence and severity of anemia. Researchers sought to understand the prevalence of anemia in rural areas from a public health standpoint. Understanding the prevalence of anemia in specific regions in India is imperative to identifying where to focus therapies that target iron deficiency and other causes of anemia, such as through the administration of iron, folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin C, and deworming medications. Methods and Materials Blood samples were taken to measure hemoglobin levels (g/dl) utilizing the glucometer device from two samples: boys and girls ages 0-18, and women ages 18-45 in the villages of Dhank, Kolki, and Bhimora villages in the state of Gujarat. Sample sizes were n=17,111 children and n=9,151 women. Researchers at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine teamed up with the public health research team to statistically analyze hemoglobin level data, understanding prevalence of anemia in in the three villages. Researchers calculated the prevalence of anemia in both groups based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Results The results show levels of moderate and severe anemia within the states of Kolki, Bhimora, and Dhank for children aged 0-18 and women aged 18-45. In the children group, the highest level of \"moderate\" to \"severe anemia\" was in Bhimora. The lowest level of \"severe anemia\" and highest level of \"no anemia\" were in Kolki. Similar results were seen in the women's group. In the women's group, the highest level of \"moderate\" and \"severe anemia\" were in Bhimora. The lowest level of \"severe anemia\" and highest level of \"no anemia\" were in Kolki. Conclusion Anemia is a serious public health crisis within the state of Gujarat, specifically in the villages of Kolki, Bhimora, and Dhank for children 0-18 and women 18-45, as indicated by the high prevalence of moderate and severe anemia in these areas. These findings call for interventions to combat this public health issue. Future study of the data will show which specific socioeconomic factors (caste, class, working status, etc.) are associated with lower hemoglobin levels. These future studies, in turn, will guide the targeted deployment of iron, folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin C, and deworming tablets along with extensive educational intervention.
