    "abstract_text": "MF is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by abnormal megakaryocytes and elevated proinflammatory cytokines which results in bone marrow fibrosis, progressive hepatosplenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis, and debilitating constitutional symptoms. Current treatments, including ruxolitinib (the only approved drug for MF), provide symptomatic relief but have limited effects on the underlying disease. Effective therapies with potential MF disease course modification and second line therapies are urgently needed. CPI-0610 has been evaluated in 3 Phase 1 studies in > 140 patients with lymphoma, multiple myeloma and acute leukemias/myelodysplastic syndrome/MF. Although CPI-0610 was tested at doses as high as 400 mg PO QD, the maximum tolerated dose was 225 mg PO QD for 2 weeks on, 1 week off. Clear anti-tumor activity was observed in patients with lymphomas, particularly ABC-DLBCL (Blum et al. TAT conference 2018). Preclinical data on CPI-0610 demonstrated downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines through its effects on NF-\u03baB pathway as well as inhibition of megakaryocyte differentiation. Both of these features are thought to be important in the pathogenesis of MF. In addition, a recent preclinical publication using a mouse model of MF, suggests that BET inhibition reduces inflammatory cytokine production, platelet counts, spleen volume and bone marrow fibrosis, the effects of which were further magnified when combined with ruxolitinib (Kleppe et al. 2018). Taken together, these data suggest that BET inhibitors such as CPI-0610, administered with and without ruxolitinib, have the potential to affect the underlying MF disease and supports further clinical evaluation of CPI-0610 in patients with MF. Therefore, we have embarked on a Phase 2 trial of CPI-0610 as monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib. This Phase 2 study aims to evaluate CPI-0610 as a monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with MF who are not eligible to receive a JAK inhibitor or have had an inadequate response to ruxolitinib. The primary objectives are to evaluate spleen volume response by imaging after 24 weeks of therapy and to evaluate the effect on transfusion independence rate. Other key secondary objectives are to evaluate the change in patient reported outcomes and the duration of splenic response. Exploratory objectives include characterizing the effects of treatment on the bone marrow and blood biomarkers. The Phase 2 study has a 2-stage design to enroll up to 35 patients in each arm (monotherapy and combination therapy) if \u22652 responses are observed during stage 1. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02158858. Disclosures Kremyanskaya: Incyte: Research Funding.
