    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3326 In patients with von Willebrand's disease (VWD) replacement therapy with factor VIII/VWF concentrates is increasingly applied as prophylactic regimen. Since 2000, 82 consecutively enrolled patients with clinically relevant bleeding episodes were diagnosed with VWD. In all patients, decision for initiating prophylaxis was based on a bleeding score >2 prior to diagnosis, concomitant with recurrent bleedings associated with anemia in patients with on-demand therapy. We report results on secondary prophylactic VWF replacemment therapy applied 13 children, 7 adolescents and 4 adults (n=24) with VWD type 1 (n=4), 2 (n=12) and the severe type 3 (n=8). Based on individual 24h VWF:RCo recoveries [aim: 0.01 to 0.02 IU/ml > baseline] median dose was 40 [min. 20- max. 47] IU/kg, 15 patients were give substitution therapy semiweekly, 7 patients thrice weekly and 2 children four times per week. Within a 12-months-period hemoglobin conentrations returned to normal values. Median duration of prophylaxis was 3 years. Recurrent bleeding episodes stopped in 23/24 patients. One female type 3 patient additionally needed locally applied tranexamic acid [tooth bruising]. Following a 12-months observation period the monthly bleeding frequency and the bleeding score was significantly reduced [3 vs. 0.07; 3 vs. 0: p< 0.001], compared to the pre-prophylaxis/ pre-diagnostic values. Conclusion: The use of secondary prophylactic VWF replacement therapy with FVIII/VWF concentrate is an effective tolerated treatment modality, highly benefical for patients with VWD, who present recurrent bleeding events during an on-demand therapy.
