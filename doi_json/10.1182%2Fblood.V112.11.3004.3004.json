    "abstract_text": "[Study purpose] We have reported that overall results of cord blood transplantation (CBT) were inferior to those of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from unrelated donor in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) including transformed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML/MDS) (ASH 2007). Poor engraftment and higher incidence of relapse in CBT patients were serious problems. We now show here the impact of conditioning regimen and GVHD prophylaxis method on clinical outcomes of CBT, and then show the results when we looked for the appropriate graft selection in terms of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatibility and cell dose. [Patients and Methods] Clinical data of 333 patients with MDS including AML/MDS who received unrelated CBT without prior transplant history between 1998 and 2006 in Japan were collected by the Japan Cord Blood Bank Network (JCBBN). The median period of follow-up for survivors (n=148) after transplants was 13 (range, 1\u201399) months. We analyzed the hematopoietic recovery, incidences of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), risks of transplant-related mortality (TRM) and relapse, and disease-free survival (DFS) using competing risk regression models. [Results] Both myeloablative conditioning regimen including 8Gy or more dose of total body irradiation (TBI) and GVHD prophylaxis as calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporin or taclorimus) plus methotrexate (MTX) significantly (p15 years old), grafts had relatively high quantity with narrow range, which the median numbers of nucleated cells, CD34 positive cells and CFU-GM were 2.57 (74% patients in 2.0\u20133.5 dose range) \u00d710 7 /kg, 0.85 (76% in 0.5\u20132.0 dose range) \u00d710 5 /kg and 25.4 (77% in 10\u201350 dose range) \u00d710 3 /kg, respectively. [Conclusion] Myeloablative conditioning regimen with TBI and calcineurin inhibitors plus MTX for GVHD prophylaxis in CBT might be promising for MDS patients and HLA disparity possibly contributed on lower risk of relapse and better DFS in this setting."
