    "abstract_text": "Background: For patients (pts) with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), combination chemotherapy achieves complete remission rates of 80-90%; however, many pts ultimately relapse, leading to a cure rate of only 40-50%. Blinatumomab is highly effective in both the relapsed/refractory setting and for eradication of measurable residual disease (MRD). We hypothesized that early incorporation of blinatumomab in pts with newly diagnosed Ph-negative B-cell ALL would decrease the need for intensive chemotherapy, lead to deeper and more durable responses, and improve survival. Methods: Pts 14-59 years of age with newly diagnosed Ph-negative pre-B-cell ALL, including pts who had received no more than 1 prior cycle of chemotherapy, were eligible. Pts were required to have a performance status of \u22643, total bilirubin \u22642 mg/dl and creatinine \u22642 mg/dl. Pts received hyper-CVAD alternating with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine for up to 4 cycles, followed by 4 cycles of blinatumomab at standard doses. Pts with CD20+ disease (\u22651% cells) received 8 doses of ofatumumab (2000 mg) or rituximab (375 mg/m 2 ). Eight administrations of prophylactic IT chemotherapy were given in the first 4 cycles. Maintenance was with alternating blocks of POMP (given in maintenance cycles 1-3, 5-7, 9-11, and 13-15) and blinatumomab (given in maintenance cycles 4, 8, and 12). After 2 pts with high-risk features experienced early relapse prior to blinatumomab administration, for pts #10+ the protocol was amended so that pts with high-risk disease features (e.g. CRLF2+ by flow cytometry, complex karyotype, KMT2A rearranged, low-hypodiploidy/near triploidy, TP53 mutation, or persistent MRD) started blinatumomab after 2 cycles of hyper-CVAD. Results: 39 pts have been treated, 34 of whom are evaluable for efficacy (5 too early for assessment). 6 pts were in complete remission (CR) at enrollment and unevaluable for morphologic response. Pt characteristics of the 34 evaluable pts are summarized in Table 1 . Median age was 36 years (range, 17-59 years). At least one high-risk feature was present in 19 pts (56%), including TP53 mutation in 27%, CRLF2+ in 20%, and an adverse-risk karyotype in 26%. 82% of pts received ofatumumab or rituximab. Among 28 pts with active disease at study entry, 100% achieved CR, with 82% achieving CR after the first cycle. MRD negativity by 6-color flow cytometry was achieved in 20/23 responding pts (87%) after 1 cycle and 33/34 pts (97%) overall. There were no early deaths, and the 60-day mortality rate was 0%. With a median follow-up of 22 months (range, 1-40 months), the 2-year continuous remission and OS rates were 79% and 86%, respectively ( Figure 1 ). Overall, 5 pts (15%) relapsed, 12 (35%) underwent allogeneic SCT in first remission (including 1 additional pt who relapsed post-SCT), and 17 (50%) remain in continuous remission and are currently on treatment or have completed maintenance. All relapses occurred in pts with established poor-risk features, including 2 pts with KMT2A rearrangement, 2 pts with TP53 mutation (1 of whom was low hypodiploid), and 1 pt with baseline WBC count of 32 x 10 9 /L. Two of these relapses occurred during hyper-CVAD cycles before the amendment allowing for earlier integration of blinatumomab for pts with high-risk disease features. Treatment was overall well-tolerated. Four pts developed grade 2-3 cytokine release syndrome (grade 2, n=3; grade 3, n=1) which resolved with corticosteroids and interruption of blinatumomab. Overall, 14 (41%) pts had a neurological AE of any grade due to blinatumomab. Only one pt discontinued blinatumomab due to blinatumomab-related adverse event (grade 2 encephalopathy and dysphasia). Conclusion: Sequential combination of hyper-CVAD and blinatumomab is highly effective as frontline treatment of Ph-negative B-cell ALL, with a CR rate of 100% and 97% of pts achieving MRD negativity. Survival data are promising with an estimated 2-year OS of 86%, which compares favorably to historical controls. This study continues to accrue pts.
