    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Pseudo-thrombocytopenia (PTCP) is a benign artifact which generates anxiety in the patients and physicians resulting in unnecessary investigations. We report a case with profound artefactual thrombocytopenia. Case: A 31-years-old female in 38th week of gestation was referred to hematology clinic for evaluation of a platelet count of 48x10 9 /L. A month ago platelet count was 102x10 9 /L. She denied any symptoms. Examination was normal with no ecchymosis or petechiae. Laboratory work showed a white cell count of 11.2x10 9 /L, hemoglobin 10.3g/L, platelet count 8x10 9 /L and no hemolysis. Peripheral blood smear showed numerous platelet clumps (Figure 1). Estimated manual platelet count was 200x10 9 /L. To our surprise clumps and low machine count were seen in samples drawn in sodium citrate and heparin tubes as well. Discussion: Ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) dependent PTCP is a rare phenomenon with incidence of 0.09%-0.21% in general population (1). It is present in healthy subjects (2), severely ill patients with sepsis (3), autoimmune, neoplastic and liver diseases (4). PTCP may persist for 15-20 years without any clinical manifestations (5). Platelet aggregation in PTCP is due to anti-platelet antibody mediated in-vitro activation via GPIIb receptors (6). Antibodies may be IgG, IgA or IgM (5). It may be seen in samples drawn in citrate (5) heparin (7) and sodium-oxalate (8). One should suspect PTCP when there is fall in platelet count (usually <100x10 9 /L), time-dependent spurious elevation of white cells(9), a normal mean platelet volume (4) or microscopic detection of platelet aggregates (1) in a patient without clinical manifestations. There is a rare report that addition of amikacin could inhibit and dissociate pseudo platelet aggregation in multianticoagulant-dependent pseudo-thrombocytopenia and EDTA-induced pseudo-thrombocytopenia (10). Early identifications is extremely essential when therapeutic decision making hinges on platelet count viz. management of acute myocardial infarction (11).Use of samples at 37\u00b0C (2), ammonium oxalate (5, 7), addition of amikacin and peripheral smear review may help in complicated cases.
