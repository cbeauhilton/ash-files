    "abstract_text": "Introduction: It is generally known that horse antithymocytic globulin (ATGAM) are more effective for treatment of pts with acquired AA than rabbit ATG. There is no doubt, that dose regime 160 mg/kg ATGAM Improves response for young pts after 1 st course. Optimal ATGAM dose is important unsettled issue to achieve as soon as possible remission in adult pts and reduce time to allo-BMT in refractory cases. Aim of this study is to evaluateeffectiveness and response rate on ATGAM*100 and ATGAM*160 dose in adult pts with AA. Material and methods: Twenty-eight patients with acquired AA (NSAA/SAA) required in combined IST with ATGAM and cyclosporin A were included into the prospective study. We are presenting a single-center experience. The median of observation time was 29 (3-47) months. All pts were randomized before IST into 2 groups: ATGAM*100 (ATGAM 20 mg/kg/day 1-5 days, n=14) and ATGAM*160 (ATGAM 40 mg/kg/day 1-4 days, n=14). There were no significant differences between two groups in such parameters as: m\u0435diane age (26 vs 25 years); gender (M/W: 8/6 vs 9/5); severity (NSAA/SAA: 9/5 vs 7/7); median of Grans (0,68 vs 0,51x10 9 /l) and Ret (30,9 vs 17,04x10 9 /l); presence of PNH-clone ( 9 vs 12 pts); median time to the start of IST after diagnosis were 29 vs 24 months respectively. Results : The frequency of reaction to drug administration, serum sickness and infections complications were comparable in both groups. Cumulative rate of overall response was higher in ATGAM*100 group (86,6 %) vs ATGAM*160 group (76.1 %). The second course of ATGAM*100 were effective in 3 of 4 pts who did not achieve response after 1 st course, however, the second course of ATGAM*160 were not effective in 2 of 2 pts. Complete response rate after the first course of ATGAM*160 was 64%, but in group ATGAM*100 it was 36% (p>0,05) even after 2nd course. It is important to note, that median time to achieve response was less in ATGAM*160 (2,7 vs 6,2 months respectively). Conclusion: In conclusion we propose that Low-dose of ATGAM for treatment of adult AA patients were effective but not sufficient to reduce timing before allo-BMT Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
