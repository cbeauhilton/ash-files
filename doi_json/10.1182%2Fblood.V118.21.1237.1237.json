    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1237 Introduction: Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation represents a complex multi-factorial pathophysiological process in which protease disregulation along with other pathologic processes play an important role. The uncontrolled protease activities result in generation of several mediators which are not fully characterized. Biomarker profiling using protein chip array technology has been used in the identification of unique mediators in various diseases. Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption Ionisation(SELDI) is an ionization method in mass spectrometry that is used for the analysis of protein mixtures and correspondingly in the profiling of biomarkers in various diseases. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to profile and identify unique biomarkers in hospitalized patients with sepsis associated coagulopathy. Study design: There were 385 plasma samples included in this study. Baseline protein chip array profile in Molecular weight range of 0\u2013200 kDa was carried out using SELDI technique employing gold chips. Plasma samples from normal humans (n=100) and pooled preparation from both the normal (NHP) and suspect liver disease/coagulopathy were utilized as controls. Results: Of the 385 baseline samples analyzed 371 patients (96.86%) exhibited the presence of a unique biomarker at 11.6 kDa. In addition down regulation of a biomarker at 56.4 kDa was also noted in 218 of patients (56.74%) In the normal human pooled plasma the 11.6 kDa peak was nearly absent. However in Pathological pooled plasma a distinct biomarker at 11.6 kDa with a much lower intensity was noted. Additional markers in baseline samples in 1\u201310 kDa range were also noted. Conclusions: These observations suggest that sepsis associated coagulopathy results in the generation of specific unique biomarker at 11.6kDa which requires further characterization. The downregulation of biomarker at 56.4 kDa and the apparent reduction levels during hospitalization require further investigations. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
