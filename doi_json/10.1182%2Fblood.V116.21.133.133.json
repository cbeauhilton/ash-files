    "abstract_text": "Abstract 133 Introduction: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a downstream serine/threonine kinase of the PI3K/Akt pathway that integrates signals from the tumor microenvironment such as cytokines and growth factors, nutrients and stresses to regulate multiple cellular processes, including translation, autophagy, metabolism, growth, motility and survival. Mechanistically, mTOR operates in two distinct multi-protein complexes, TORC1 and TORC2. Activation of TORC1 leads to the phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase and 4E-BP1, while activation of TORC2 regulates phosphorylation of Akt and other AGC kinases. In multiple myeloma (MM), PI3K/Akt plays an essential role enhancing cell growth and survival and is activated by the loss of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN and by the bone marrow microenvironment. Rapamycin analogues such as RAD001 and CCI-779 have been tested in clinical trials in MM. Their efficacy as single agents is modest, but when used in combination, they show higher responses. However, total inhibition of Akt and 4E-BP1 signaling requires inactivation of both complexes TORC1 and TORC2. Consequently, there is a need for novel inhibitors that can target mTOR in both signaling complexes. In this study we have evaluated the role of TORC1 and TORC2 in MM and the activity and mechanism of action of INK128, a novel, potent, selective and orally active small molecule TORC1/2 kinase inhibitor. Methods: Nine different MM cell lines and BM samples from MM patients were used in the study. The mechanism of action was investigated by MTT, Annexin V, cell cycle analysis, Western-blotting and siRNA assays. For the in vivo analyses, Luc + /GFP + MM.1S cells (2 \u00d7 10 6 /mouse) were injected into the tail vein of 30 SCID mice and tumor progression was detected by bioluminescence imaging. Nanofluidic proteomic immunoassays were performed in selected tumors. Results: To examine activation of the mTOR pathway in MM, we performed kinase activity assays and protein analyses of mTOR complexes and its downstream targets in nine MM cell lines. We found mTOR, Akt, pS6R and 4E-BP1 are constitutively activated in all cell lines tested independently of the status of Deptor, PTEN, and PI3K. All cell lines expressed either Raptor, Rictor or both; excepting H929 and U266LR7 which were negative for both of them. Moreover, primary plasma cells from several MM patients highly expressed pS6R while normal cells were negative for this protein. We found that INK128 and rapamycin effectively suppressed phosphorylation of p6SR, but only INK128 was able to decrease phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. We observed that INK128 fully suppressed cell viability in a dose and time dependent manner, but rapamycin reached a plateau in efficacy at \u00b1 60%. The IC 50 of INK128 was in the range of 7.5\u201330 nM in the eight cell lines tested. Similar results were observed in freshly isolated plasma cells from MM patients. Besides the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, INK128 was more potent than rapamycin to induce autophagy, and only INK128 was able to induce PARP and Caspases 3, 8 and 9 cleavage. In the bone marrow microenvironment context, INK128 inhibited the proliferation of MM cells and decreased the p4E-BP1 induction. Importantly, treatment with rapamycin under such conditions did not affect cell proliferation. INK128 also showed a significantly greater effect inhibiting cell adhesion to fibronectin OPM2 MM1S, BMSCs and HUVECs compared to rapamycin. These results were confirmed in vivo . Oral daily treatment of NK128 (1.0 mg/kg) decreased tumor growth and improved survival of mice implanted with MM1S. Conclusion: Dual inhibition of TORC1 and TORC2 represent a new and promising approach in the treatment of MM and its microenvironment. The ability of INK128 to inhibit both TORC1 and TORC2 strongly supports the potential use of this compound in MM patients.
