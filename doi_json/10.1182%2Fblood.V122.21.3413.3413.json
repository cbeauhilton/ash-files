    "abstract_text": "Spatio-temporal regulation of switches in alternative pre-mRNA splicing modulate exon usage, critically remodeling the transcriptome during development and differentiation of many tissues, while aberrant regulation of alternative splicing disrupts these processes and plays a role in numerous human diseases. Recently, the discovery of splicing factor mutations in myelodysplasia has increased interest in splicing regulation in hematology. Previously, a functionally critical erythroid splicing switch in protein 4.1 pre-mRNA has been reported, in which activation of alternative exon 16 splicing in late erythroblasts is required for assembly of a mechanically stable red cell membrane. To explore globally the landscape of important alternative splicing events in the erythroid lineage, we applied RNA-seq analysis to five highly FACS-purified populations of human erythroblasts, cultured from CD34 + cord blood progenitors, representing proerythroblasts, early and late basophilic erythroblasts, polychromatophilic erythroblasts, and orthochromatophilic erythroblasts. Alternative splicing events predicted by computational analysis were filtered to remove low expression genes and low frequency splicing events, to derive a list of >3000 \u2018major\u2019 alternative splicing events of potential importance in erythroid biology. Many of these were validated by inspection of RNA-seq reads mapped on the human genome, and/or by RT-PCR analysis. In this unique differentiation system we found an extensive and dynamic alternative splicing program enriched in genes that function in cell cycle regulation, organelle organization, chromatin structure and function, and RNA processing. For example, we identified alternative splicing events in \u223c25 genes encoding chromatin modifying enzymes that methylate, demethylate, or acetylate specific lysine or arginine residues in histones; in transcription modulators such as ATRX and BCL11A that regulate normal globin gene expression; and in \u223c50 RNA binding proteins with various roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Comparison of PSI (percent spliced in) values across the differentiation series revealed that dozens of alternative exons exhibit substantial switches in splicing efficiency during terminal erythropoiesis. The majority of splicing switches occur in late-stage polychromatophilic and orthochromatophilic erythroblasts, temporally correlated with changes in transcript abundance for many splicing factors and with substantial cell remodeling prior to enucleation. One of the biggest switches in late erythroblasts involves inclusion of a 35nt exon in the NDEL1 (nuclear distribution factor E-homolog-like1) gene, which alters C-terminal structure of a protein that functions in nuclear migration and nucleokinesis in nonerythroid cells and may have a role in erythroblast enucleation. Most of the regulated splicing events insert or delete sequences predicted to modulate protein structure and function in late erythroblasts. However, a subset of altered splicing events have a different effect on gene expression by introducing premature translation termination codons (PTCs), leading us to hypothesize that alternative splicing-coupled nonsense-mediated-decay (AS-NMD) contributes to stage-specific down-regulation of numerous erythroid transcripts. Consistent with such a model, most genes that up-regulate PTC exons in late erythroblasts exhibit reduction in overall expression levels, and inhibition of NMD increases the apparent expression of PTC isoforms. In contrast, genes that up-regulate coding exons are not preferentially down-regulated in late erythroblasts. We conclude that a dynamically regulated alternative splicing program in terminally differentiating erythroblasts plays a major post-transcriptional role in shaping gene expression as the cells transition from proliferation to differentiation, ensuring synthesis of the appropriate constellation of proteins as the cells prepare for enucleation and production of mature red cells.
