    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3877 Members of the nuclear transport receptor family of importins and exportins regulate the passage of proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Although evolutionarily conserved across several species, Exportin 7 (Xpo7 or RanBP16) and its cargo are not well understood. In our study, we find that Xpo7 is highly erythroid-specific, as all other exportins are downregulated during terminal erythroid differentiation, a process including the induction of a highly specialized erythroid expression program, a set number of 3\u20135 terminal cell divisions, and chromatin condensation and eventual enucleation. Xpo7, in contrast, is highly induced during terminal erythropoiesis. Using retroviral shRNA knockdown of Xpo7 in in vitro fetal liver erythroid cell cultures, we demonstrate that exportin 7 is necessary for normal cellular proliferation and terminal erythroid differentiation, specifically for normal enucleation. Through microarray and biocomputational analysis of mRNA isolated from the knockdown cultures, we have found that the promoters of genes that are dysregulated after Xpo7 knockdown are enriched for binding sites for the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Given that the erythroid phenotype of the ATF4 knockout mouse is very similar to the specific erythroid defects we observe in our in vitro knockdown analysis, our data suggests that either ATF4 or its binding protein may be Xpo7's cargo during terminal erythroid differentiation. Ongoing studies aimed at confirming this mechanism, the interaction between ATF4 and Xpo7, and the role and cargo of Xpo7 in terminal erythroid differentiation, are underway.
