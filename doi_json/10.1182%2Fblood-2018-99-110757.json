    "abstract_text": "The pathogenesis of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and many other immunodeficiencies is elusive, and no cure for these diseases exists. The characteristic features of CVID are immunoglobulin deficiency and recurrent infections, but autoimmunity co-manifests in 30% and lymphoproliferation in 50% of CVID cases. The failure to produce sufficient quantities of immunoglobulins is attributed to B cells, but as T cells are critical players in adaptive immune response and autoimmune disease, they have also suggested to play a role in CVID. As monogenic germline mutations account only for 2-10% of CVID cases, the etiology of CVID remains unknown in most cases. To study if somatic mutations in T cells contribute to immunodeficiencies, we recruited patients with broad immune dysregulation: 8 patients with late-onset CVID, and 9 patients with other type of immunodeficiency and/or severe autoimmunity. All patients signed informed consent and the declaration of Helsinki principles were followed. Study design and key patient characteristics are depicted in the Figure. To discover somatic mutations in T cells, we sequenced both CD4+ and CD8+ cells with a custom gene panel comprising of 2500 immune-related genes with an average coverage of 500x. Somatic variants were identified using the GATK MuTect2 toolset by using a panel of 21 healthy controls' CD4+ and CD8+ cells as a background. Variants were called using paired samples (CD4+ vs CD8+ and vice versa ). This approach identifies variants that have occurred in mature T cells. To complement this approach, we performed variant calling also in single-sample mode to identify variants originating from hematopoietic progenitors. Paired-sample analyses revealed 44 somatic mutations in mature T cells in 10/17 (59%) patients: 30 (68%) in CD8+ and 14 (32%) in CD4+ cells. The mutations included 2 frameshift-, 37 missense-, and 5 nonsense variants. In silico tools (both Polyphen-2 and SIFT) predicted 19 (51%) of the missense mutations to be damaging. The Catalogue Of Somatic mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) database included 9/44 (20%) of all mutations. Also, pathway analysis annotated 20% of the mutated genes to be involved in inflammatory response regulation, 27.5% in protein phosphorylation regulation, and 22.5% in positive regulation of cell proliferation. Interesting mutation findings included two patients with STAT5B mutations (N418K and T628S) with a low variant-allele (VAF) frequencies (3.2-3.6% in CD4+ cells), one patient with a KRAS T58I mutation (VAF 7.9% in CD8+), and two patients with distinct C5AR1 mutations (R197W and T62M). Complementing the paired-sample variant calling strategy, single-sample analyses revealed mutations associated with clonal hematopoiesis with low VAFs (2.2-5.5%) in T cells in 4 (23.5%) patients. Three patients had DNMT3A mutations and one patient 4 distinct TET2 mutations (2 nonsense-, 1 frameshift-, and 1 missense mutations). CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires were profiled with deep TCR beta chain (TCRB) sequencing. Healthy controls' CD4+ and CD8+ cells (n=27) were used as comparators. Although some CVID patients harbor major (17-20% of CD8+) T-cell clones, overall CD4+ or CD8+ clonality did not significantly differ from age-matched healthy controls. As a marker of selective pressure, CVID patients' CD4+ and CD8+ cells harbored more clones that shared a CDR3 amino-acid but had distinct nucleotide CDR3 sequences than healthy controls (7.0% vs 3.3% of all amino-acid rearrangements, p=0.021 for CD8+; 4.3% vs 3.5% p=0.013 for CD4+). These TCRs were not enriched with pathogen-specific (such as cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus) TCRs. Moreover, high CD4+ clonality was associated with a lower frequency of switched-memory-B cells. In conclusion, somatic mutations in T cells occurred in 59% of patients with immunodeficiency in this study, and some of the mutated genes (such as STAT5B ) have previously been implicated for the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation. Also, clonal hematopoiesis in T cells was discovered in 23.5% of patients. The overall T-cell clonality was not increased, but CVID patients showed slight selective pressure in the TCR repertoire. Our results demonstrate that further research on somatic mutations in immunodeficiencies is needed, as they may contribute to disease pathogenesis in a subset of immunodeficiency patients.
