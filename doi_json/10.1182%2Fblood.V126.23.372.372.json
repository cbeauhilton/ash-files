    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Next generation sequencing of over 800 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) cases has established the mutational landscape and key cancer driver pathways. The mutational basis of relapse has not been systematically studied. Two previous studies (Keats et al.; Bolli et al.) identified 4 patterns of clonal evolution. Neither study included uniformly treated patients and looked at the impact of therapy on clonal structure at relapse. Understanding the mutational patterns underlying relapse and how they relate to specific therapies is crucial in order to improve MM outcomes, especially for high-risk (HR) MM. In this study we compare the clonal structure at presentation (PRES) and at relapse (REL), after exposure to Total Therapy (TT). Materials and Methods: We studied 33 pairs of tumor samples collected at PRES and REL. 9 patients were treated on TT2, 13 on TT3, 10 on TT4 and 1 on TT5-like regimen. Eleven patients had HR disease at PRES. DNA was extracted from CD138+ selected cells from random bone marrow aspirates. Germline controls were obtained from leukapheresis products. Whole exome sequencing libraries were prepared using the Agilent qXT kit and the Agilent SureSelect Clinical Research Exome kit with additional baits covering the Ig and MYC loci. All samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 to a median depth of 120x. Sequencing data were aligned to the Ensembl GRCh37/hg19 human reference using BWA. Somatic variants were called using MuTect. Translocations were identified using MANTA. Copy number variations were inferred using TITAN. Gene expression profiles (GEP), generated using the Affymetrix U133plus2 microarray, were available for all tumor samples. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) was used to define mutation signatures. Results: The median time to progression was 30 months with a median follow up of 9.5 years. 22 cases achieved a complete remission (CR) or near CR. There were 11 cases of HR at PRES. Of the 22 cases with low risk (LR) MM, 7 relapsed with HR disease. There were on average 478 SNVs per sample at PRES and 422 at REL. All but 2 cases had evidence of new mutations at REL. There were no consistent patterns or number of mutation associated with REL or GEP-defined risk. Patients of the MF molecular subgroup had more mutations compared to other molecular subgroups (657 vs. 379) and were enriched for mutations with an APOBEC signature. We did not detect any mutation signature consistent with chemotherapy-induced alterations, providing evidence that TT itself does not cause additional mutations. Primary recurrent IgH translocations called by MANTA were confirmed by GEP data. A number of new translocations were identified , several only at REL. In particular we demonstrate a case with a newly acquired MYC translocation at relapse, indicating that it contributed to progression. We identified 5 patterns of clonal evolution (Figure 1): A) genetically distinct relapse in 3 patients, B) linear evolution in 8 patients, C) clonal selection in 9 patients, D) branching evolution in 11 patients, and E) stable clone(s) in 2 patients. Patterns A (distinct) and B (linear) were associated with low risk and longer survival, whereas patterns D (branching) and E (stable) were associated with high risk and shorter time to relapse and overall survival (Table 1). Conclusion: This is the first study to systematically analyze the pattern of clonal evolution using NGS in patients treated with combination chemotherapy and tandem ASCT. We identified 5 patterns of evolution, which correlate with survival. We identified 3 cases with a loss of the original clone and emergence of a new clone, suggesting high effectiveness of Total Therapy for those patients. The persistence of major clones despite multi agent chemotherapy in most other cases supports a concept of a tumor-initiating cell population that persist in a protective niche, for which new therapies are needed.
