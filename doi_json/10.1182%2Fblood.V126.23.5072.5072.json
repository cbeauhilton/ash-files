    "abstract_text": "Background Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most frequent NHL subtype and the risk for it increases with age. At the same time, in advanced countries, the population over 65 years old is increasing because of the continuous increase in life expectancy and as a result the incidence of DLBCL is increasing as well. Increasing age is a major determinant of therapeutic decisions since it is associated with the presence of concomitant diseases, however elderly (over 65 years old) and very elderly (>80 years old) patients are not often included in clinical trials. Consequently, the optimal management of patients in the very elderly has not been identified. We conducted a single-center retrospective study with the objective to compare the comorbidity profiles, chemotherapy offered and tolerance, as well as outcome between elderly and very elderly DLBCL patients. Method A chart review of patients diagnosed with DLBCL in our center from January 2008 to January 2014 identified 33 patients aged between 60 to 79 years (elderly group, EG) and 30 patients aged 80 or more (very elderly group, VEG). We analyzed the clinical and laboratory characteristics (gender, extranodal disease presence, International Prognostic Index (IPI) factors, ECOG performance status (PS), Charlson comorbidity index, B-symptoms, hemoglobin, serum albumin), Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in comparison between the two groups. Furthermore, we studied the percentage of patients that were offered chemotherapy in each group, the regimen that was offered and the completion of chemotherapy as planned. Results: Median age for the EG was 72 years and for the VEG was 84 years (80 - 93). Significant differences between EG and VEG were found in mean serum albumin concentration at diagnosis (3.48 vs. 2.77, p=0.008), ECOG PS (0.91 vs. 2.36, p=0.000), and International Prognostic Index (IPI) (1.76 vs. 2.54, p=0.023) between EG and VEG. Compared to EG, VEG patients were more likely to have comorbidities (100 vs. 81.8%, p=0.025) and extra-nodal disease (93.3% vs. 66.7%, p=0.012). Though there was no statistically significant difference in percent of patients receiving chemotherapy, greater percent of EG (60.6) received R-CHOP regimen compared to VEG (20.0, p=0.001). There was no significant difference in therapy related toxicity, but fewer patients in the VEG (60 vs. 90.5%, p=0.039) were able to complete the course of chemotherapy planned and fewer achieved CR (35.7% vs. 68.2, p=0.036). Median overall survival was 762 vs. 650 days (p=0.793) and median progression free survival was 704 vs. 331 days (p= 0.180) for EG versus VEG. Conclusion: Very elderly DLBCL patients may differ from elderly patients in ECOG PS, comorbidity profile and chemotherapy regimen. These patients were less likely to complete the course of chemotherapy and fewer achieved complete response compared to the elderly group. There were no statistically significant differences in outcomes between the two groups. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
