    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3842 Poster Board III-778 Background and Rationale Vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) act via selectively disrupting established tumor vasculature and have shown remarkable clinical success as anti-cancer therapies. NPI-2358 is a novel VDA with a distinct structure and mechanism of action from other available VDAs. NPI-2358 binds to the colchicine-binding site of beta-tubulin preventing polymerization and disrupting the cytoplasmic microtubule network, thereby causing loss of vascular endothelial cytoskeletal function, and inducing cytotoxicity in cancer cells. Here, we examined the anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity of NPI-2358 in multiple myeloma (MM) cells using both in vitro and in vivo model systems. Material and Methods We utilized MM.1S, MM.1R, RPMI-8226, U266, and INA-6 human MM cell lines, as well as purified tumor cells from MM patients relapsing after prior anti-MM therapies. Cell viability/apoptosis assays were performed using MTT, trypan blue exclusion, and Annexin V/PI staining. Angiogenesis was measured in vitro using Matrigel capillary-like tube structure formation assays: Since human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) plated onto Matrigel differentiate and form capillary-like tube structures similar to in vivo neovascularization, this assay measures anti-angiogenic effects of drugs/agents. Migration assays were performed using transwell insert assays. Immunoblot analysis was performed using antibodies to caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, PARP, Bcl-2, Bax, pJNK and GAPDH. Statistical significance was determined using a Student t test. Results Treatment of MM.1S, RPMI-8226, MM.1R, INA-6, and KMS-12BM with NPI-2358 for 24h induces a dose-dependent significant (P < 0.005) decrease in viability of all cell lines (IC 50 range: 5-8 nM; n=3). To determine whether NPI-2358-induced decrease in viability is due to apoptosis, MM cell lines were treated with NPI-2358 for 24h; harvested, and analyzed for apoptosis using Annexin V/PI staining. A significant increase in NPI-2358-induced apoptosis was observed in all MM cell lines (% Annexin V+/PI- apoptotic cells: MM.1S, 48 \u00b1 2.3%; MM.1R, 46.6 \u00b1 3.1%; RPMI-8226, 61.7 \u00b1 4.5%; and INA-6, 59.9 \u00b1 3.2%; P < 0.05; n=3). Importantly, NPI-2358 decreased viability of freshly isolated MM cells from patients (IC 50 range: 3-7 nM; P < 0.005), without affecting the viability of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting specific anti-MM activity and a favorable therapeutic index for NPI-2358. Examination of in vitro angiogenesis using capillary-like tube structure formation assay showed that even low doses of NPI-2358 (7 nM treatment for 12h; IC 50 : 20 nM at 24h) significantly decreased tubule formation in HUVECs (70-80% decrease; P < 0.05). Transwell insert assays showed a marked reduction in serum-dependent migration of NPI-2358-treated MM cells (42 \u00b1 2.1% inhibition in NPI-2358-treated vs . control; P < 0.05). NPI-2358 at the concentrations tested (5 nM for 12h) in the migration assays did not affect survival of MM cells (> 95% viable cells). A similar anti-migration activity of NPI-2358 was noted against HUVEC cells (48 \u00b1 1.7% decrease in migration; P < 0.05). Mechanistic studies showed that NPI-2358-induced apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP. Importantly, treatment of MM.1S cells with NPI-2358 (5 nM) triggered phosphorylation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), a classical stress response protein, without affecting Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bcl-2. Blockade of JNK using dominant negative strategy markedly abrogated NPI-2358-induced apoptosis. Conclusion Our preclinical data provide evidence for remarkable anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity of NPI-2358 against MM cells, without significant toxicity in normal cells. Ongoing studies are examining in vivo anti-MM activity of NPI-2358 in animal models. Importantly, a Phase-1 study of NPI-2358 as a single agent in patients with advanced malignancies (lung, prostrate and colon cancer) has already established a favorable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety profile; and, a Phase-2 study of the combination of NPI-2358 and docetaxel in non-small cell lung cancer showed encouraging safety, pharmacokinetic and activity data. These findings, coupled with our preclinical studies, provide the framework for the development of NPI-2358-based novel therapies to improve patient outcome in MM.
