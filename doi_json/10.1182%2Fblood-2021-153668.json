    "abstract_text": "Background: Cyclic neutropenia is a rare hematologic disorder affecting neutrophils. It is classified by recurrent neutropenia (typically every three weeks) with associated symptoms including fever, malaise, and recurrent mucosal and skin infections. Pathogenic variants of ELANE, the gene that encodes neutrophil elastase, are thought to cause these findings, however, other pathogenic variants of different genes have also been noted. The estimated frequency of cyclic neutropenia is 1/10 6 in the general population. It is most commonly diagnosed in children but may rarely be diagnosed in adulthood. There is no known increased prevalence in women as compared to men. Whole Exome Sequencing can be used for diagnosis when genetic concerns are present. Objective: This case report aims to describe a novel pathogenic variant in a pediatric patient with cyclic neutropenia. Design/Method: Single subject case report Results: This is a single case report of a 7-year-old female with past medical history of cyclic neutropenia, anemia, recurrent skin and buccal infections, speech delay, and behavioral problems. The patient initially presented at age 1 with high fevers and skin infections and was found to have decreased neutrophil counts. Work up at that time was consistent with cyclic neutropenia. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy performed at 1 and 7 years of age showed decreased neutrophil count with normal maturation without any evidence of MDS. Her peripheral blood for bone marrow failure evaluation was non-contributory. Due to persistent neutropenia, normal bone marrow findings, and being on weekly chronic G-CSF administration Whole Exome Sequencing was evaluated. Results of which showed a novel compound heterozygous pattern for two variant copies of the G6PC3 gene, with our patient inheriting a copy from each parent. Discussion : The G6PC3 gene encodes the expressed glucose-6-phosphate enzyme which catalyzes the final step in glycogenolysis. It is hypothesized that this deficiency causes unregulated levels of glucose, resulting in increased stress of the endoplasmic reticulum leading to apoptosis of neutrophils. Pathogenic variants of G6PC3 cause autosomal recessive G6PC3 deficiency and this can be clinically characterized as severe congenital neutropenia. Classic G6PC3 deficiency includes severe congenital neutropenia as well as cardiovascular abnormalities, urogenital abnormalities, and pulmonary hypertension. This novel pathogenic variant is likely responsible for the cyclic neutropenia observed in our patient. G6PC3 variants are an important differential diagnosis in the work-up of other causes of neutropenia. Whole Exome Sequencing is a cost-effective method for diagnosis and a valuable tool in evaluation and management of complex hematologic disorders.
