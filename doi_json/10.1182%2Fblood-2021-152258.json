    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Molecular diagnostic testing for lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) includes detection of clonal immunoglobulin (IG) and/or T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements, translocations, copy number alterations (CNA) and somatic mutations. To date, laboratories still rely on subjective and labour-intensive technologies, e.g. karyotyping/FISH to detect complex genomic alterations. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) can detect all genomic alterations, but factors such as cost, computation/storage, DNA requirements and poor detection of clinically relevant subclonal mutations limits the routine implementation of WGS in clinical diagnostics. We have developed \"KaryoSequencing\" (KS), a novel approach that combines targeted deep-sequencing, using a targeted hybridisation capture NGS panel, for rare mutation and translocation detection with shallow WGS (sWGS) for genome wide copy number analysis, in a single test. Methods: KS was validated using 138 clinical samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (n=46), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (n=46) and plasma cell myeloma (PCM) (n=46) samples from 3 UK laboratories. Samples underwent library preparation and hybridisation using the EuroClonality-NDC assay. A KS library for each sample was prepared by combining the pre-capture and post-capture libraries at an optimised ratio to enable high coverage (>500 x) at regions covered by the targeted panel while providing 0.5-1x coverage genome-wide. Forty-six KS libraries were pooled and sequenced per NovaSeq 6000 run, using a 200-cycle SP flow cell and a 100bp paired-end strategy. For analysis of targeted regions, somatic mutation calling was performed using VarDict and structural variants (rearrangements and translocations) were detected using ARResT/Interrogate. For analysis of large chromosomal copy number variation using sWGS, a modified version of QDNASeq/ACE with a window size of 50kb was performed. For sWGS analysis, bioinformatic exclusion of all target capture regions and panel-specific off-target regions was performed using a panel of 48 DNA samples from healthy individuals ran on the same KS protocol. Results: Analysis of genome-wide copy number by sWGS was concordant in 477 of 503 (95%) evaluable FISH tests, including precise detection of hyper and hypo-diploidy and other complex karyotypes. The performance of the targeted deep-sequencing component of the KS approach was assessed to ensure comparable performance to previously validated results for the EuroClonality-NDC. The EuroClonality-NDC detected a clonal IG rearrangement in 46/46 (100%) CLL cases and in 42/46 (91.3%) PCM cases. Clonality was detected in 43/46 (93.5%) and 44/46 (95.7%) cases at an IG and TCR locus respectively in ALL, a disease entity known to exhibit cross-lineage rearrangements. Overall, 44 translocations were detected in the 138 samples by the EuroClonality-NDC. FISH results were available for 32 of the 44 translocations detected by NGS and were concordant in 29/32 (91%). In two PCM samples NGS and FISH reported a different translocation; in the ALL sample, the FISH pattern showed an additional copy but not a split signal. Across the entire cohort of 138 samples, KaryoSequencing detected 190 mutations with a variant allele frequency ranging from 4.0 - 97.6%. Of the detected mutations, 69/190 (36.3%) had a VAF <20% which can be difficult to detect reliably with typical coverage depths observed with conventional WGS. The most frequently mutated genes were KRAS [30.4%], NRAS [13.0%], KMT2D [10.9%] in ALL ; SF3B1 [23.9%], NOTCH1 [19.6%], ATM [15.2%] and TP53 [13.0%] in CLL and KRAS [19.6%], NRAS [15.2%] and TP53 [10.9%] in PCM, consistent with expected frequencies in each entity. Conclusions: KaryoSequencing demonstrated >95% sensitivity and specificity for detection of gross genome-wide copy number alterations while retaining the analytical performance for detection of rearrangements, translocations, and mutations for the lymphoid-specific targeted regions of the EuroClonality-NDC assay. KS is a cost-effective and high-throughput integrated alternative to current diagnostic strategies in haematological malignancies and can be implemented in routine clinical practice.
