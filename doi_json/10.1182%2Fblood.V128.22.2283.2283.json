    "abstract_text": "[Background] FMS like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations occur in about 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients with FLT3-mutated AML have a poor prognosis and are referred for early allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in first complete remission (CR1). So far, there is still limited data available on allo-HSCT for FLT3-mutated AML in non-remission status. [Objective and method] To assess the clinical features and outcome of allo-HSCT for FLT3-mutated AML, we retrospectively analyzed patients underwent first allo-HSCT for FLT3-mutated AML excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia (FAB M3) from January 2011 to March 2016. [Result] During the study period, 332 patients received first allo-HSCT for AML in our institute. One hundred and thirty-eight were tested for the presence of FLT3-mutation and 35 showed positive results and were subjected to the analysis. The median follow-up day of survivors was 602 (101-1867). The median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 21-72). Twenty-one patients had de novo AML, 12 had AML with myelodysplasia related changes, and 2 had therapy related AML. Eighteen had normal karyotype, 4 had complex, and 13 had others. Seven were in remission (5 in CR1, and 2 in CR2), and 28 were in non-remission (8 in primary induction failure, 13 in relapse 1, and 7 in chemo na\u00efve status). Twenty-nine patients used unrelated cord blood, 2 did unrelated bone marrow, and 4 did related peripheral blood stem cell as grafts. All but 1 received myeloablative pretransplant conditionings. At 2 years after transplantation, overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), relapse rate (RR), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) of whole studied population were 65.9%, 50.2%, 28.4%, and 21.4%, respectively. Among those in non-remission before transplantation, OS, DFS, RR, and NRM at 2 years post-transplant were 62.2% (Figure 1A), 49.9%(Figure 1B), 24.3%, and 25.8%, respectively. Only younger age (<55 years) was the factor associated with better OS with statistical significance in multivariate analysis. [Conclusion] Our data indicated that allo-HSCT could overcome the poor prognosis of FLT3-mutated AML even for those in non-remission status, despite the profound chemo-resistant character of FLT3-mutated AML.
