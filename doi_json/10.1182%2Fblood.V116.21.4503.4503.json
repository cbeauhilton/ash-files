Therapeutic options may include donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), withdrawal of immunosuppression, rituximab, chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy and experimental treatments, but response and survival are uncertain. Result: We analyzed 72 patients with relapsed or progressive lymphoma after allogeneic HCT (1991-2007); 44 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (7 mantle cell, 5 indolent, 19 diffuse large B [DLBCL], and 13 T/NK cell) and 28 Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). At HCT, 62 patients (86%) were in remission (22 CR, 40 PR); nine (13%) had progressive disease and one had stable disease. Conditioning was myeloablative (n=17) or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) (n=55). Relapse or progression occurred at a median of 99 days (0-1898 days; 25\u201375% 43\u2013194 days). At relapse, 41 (57%) had extensive nodal disease and 56 (78%) had extranodal organ involvement. Management of relapse included: no therapy (n=5, 7%), reduction of immunosuppression (RIS) (n=58, 81%), chemotherapy alone (n=14, 19%), immunotherapy alone (n=20, 28%), combined chemo-immunotherapy (n=7, 10%) donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) (n=7, 10%), second allogeneic HCT (n=2, 3%), radiation (n=23, 32%) and other therapy (n=7, 8%). Twenty-four patients achieved a remission (15 CR, 9 PR) to the initial salvage therapy: RIS (n=13), combined chemo-immunotherapy(n=5), chemotherapy alone (n=2), radiation (n=3) or DLI (n=1). Overall, 40 (56%) patients responded (30 CR, 8 PR, 2 stable disease) with a median post-relapse overall survival of 28 months (range 0\u2013147 months). At 3 years following relapse, 44% (95% CI, 32\u201356%) survive. Favorable prognostic factors for improved 3-year survival after relapse include stage I-III at relapse, single site of relapse and most importantly, later relapse (>100 days after HCT [3 year survival 53% vs. 36%, p =0.02]). Conclusion: The overall prognosis of relapsed lymphoma after allogeneic HCT differs based upon extent of disease at relapse and time of relapse. Appropriate therapeutic approaches (RIS, combined chemo-immunotherapy, radiation or DLI) in these high risk, post transplant relapsed patients can yield promising outcome. Prospective study of post-relapse therapy to determine the most effective management strategies are warranted. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
