    "abstract_text": "Abstract 449 Dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4 and CDK6 is common in human cancer and precedes unrestrained proliferation of tumor cells in multiple myeloma (MM) patients, especially during refractory relapse. MM remains incurable due to the eventual development of drug resistance despite initial response to two main lines of therapy with proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs. Therapeutic strategies that both control the cell cycle and enhance cytotoxic killing are thus urgently needed in MM. Although targeting the cell cycle in cancer therapy has only been modestly successful because broad-spectrum CDK inhibitors lack specificity and are highly toxic, we have recently developed such a therapy by selective inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 in sequential combination with proteasome inhibitors. Using PD 0332991, the only known selective inhibitor of CDK4/CDK6 that is also potent, reversible and bioavailable, we have demonstrated that 1) induction of prolonged early G1 arrest by inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 markedly enhances the killing of primary BM myeloma cells by proteasome inhibitors despite stromal protection, and 2) release from the G1 block upon PD 0332991 withdraw leads to synchronous progression to S phase, which further augments cytotoxic killing of MM cells. To optimize targeting CDK4/CDK6 in MM, we have investigated lenalidomide as an alternative cytotoxic partner by first determining its cell cycle targeting specificity, taking advantage of the exceptional precision and efficiency with which PD 0332991 induces early G1 arrest and cell cycle synchronization. We show by simultaneous analyses of BrdU pulse labeling and DNA content per cell that lenalidomide preferentially targets MM cells following prolonged early G1 arrest by PD 0332991 pretreatment for 24 hours (twice the time needed to induce G1 arrest in MM cells), but not those synchronized into S phase after release from the G1 block. This is distinct from proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib and ONX-0921), which preferentially target MM cells synchronized into S phase over those arrested in G1. MM cells in G2/M appear to be less sensitive to both proteasome inhibitors and lenalidomide. However, these cells are rendered sensitive to these compounds upon cell cycle reentry through inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 and induction of early G1 arrest. Time course studies of DNA replication further reveal that lenalidomide alone (3 uM, daily) induces G1 arrest by 48 hours, which precedes evidence of apoptosis and reduction of viable cells at 72 hours. While the magnitude of G1 arrest induced by lenalidomide is dose-dependent (1-50 uM), the timing of cytotoxic killing does not vary. Prior induction of prolonged early G1 arrest by PD 0332991 (24 hours) enhances (> 5-fold) and also accelerates lenalidomide killing by at least 24 hours, leading to eradication of some MM cell lines. This acceleration and enhancement of lenalidomide killing appears to be mediated by synergistic reduction of IRF-4, as we have found in cell cycle enhancement of proteasome inhibitor killing. Most importantly, acceleration of early G1 arrest by inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 in primary bone marrow myeloma cells enhances lenalidomide killing in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells. Thus, the immunomodulatory compound lenalidomide induces G1 arrest and is cytotoxic for myeloma cells directly and preferentially in G1, in contrast to proteasome inhibitors, which preferentially target MM cells in S phase. Induction of prolonged early G1 arrest accelerates and enhances subsequent lenalidomide killing, which appears to be mediated by loss of IRF-4 in common with cell cycle enhancement of proteasome inhibitor killing. To implement targeting CDK4/CDK6 in combination therapy, a multi-center phase 1/2 clinical trial targeting CDK4/6 with PD 0332991 in sequential combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in relapsed refractory MM is in progress. Data from the phase 1 portion indicate that PD 0332991 is well tolerated, and directly and completely inhibits CDK4/CDK6 and the cell cycle in tumor cells in MM patients with promising clinical efficacy. Given the known clinical efficacy of lenalidomide in MM, our findings suggest lenalidomide as an attractive cytotoxic partner for targeting CDK4/CDK6 in sequential combination therapy to both control tumor expansion and enhance tumor killing in the treatment of MM.
