This study investigates pharmacogenetic risk factors for BMD and body composition in pediatric ALL. Methods We determined the influence of SNPs in 4 genes ( vitamin-D receptor (VDR: BsmI/ ApaI/ TaqI and Cdx-2/ GATA), collagen type I alpha 1 (SpI), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1: PvuII/ XbaI) and the glucocorticoid receptor (BclI) ) on body composition, BMD and fracture risk during dexamethasone-based pediatric ALL treatment. Anthropometry data of 69 patients (mean age 7.4 (range: 1.6-16.8) year) treated according to the DCOG-ALL9 protocol were evaluated. In patients aged >4 years body composition and BMD of the total body (BMD-TB) and the lumbar spine (BMD-LS) were measured repeatedly using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. To correct for bone size we calculated bone mineral apparent density of the lumbar spine (BMAD-LS) with the model BMAD-LS = BMD-LS x (4/ (n \u00d7 width)). All values were expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS). Repeated measurements analysis (ANOVA) was used. Results Non-carriers of VDR 5'-end ( Cdx-2/ GATA ) haplotype 3 revealed a significant larger fat gain than carriers (\u0394%fat: non-carriers: +1.76 SDS, carriers: +0.77 SDS, p<0.001). At diagnosis and during therapy, BMD-LS was significant higher in non-carriers of VDR 5'-end ( Cdx-2/ GATA ) haplotype 3 than in carriers. The other SNPs did not influence BMD or fracture risk during or after treatment. The year after treatment discontinuation, lean body mass increased in non-carriers of ESR1 ( PvuII/ XbaI ) haplotype 3 and decreased in carriers (\u0394 lean body mass: non-carriers: +0.28 SDS, carriers: -0.55 SDS, p<0.01). Conclusion This is the first study investigating the influence of genetic variation of the VDR , COLIA1 , ESR1 and GR on body composition, BMD and fracture risk in pediatric ALL. We found the VDR 5'-end ( Cdx-2/GATA) haplotype 3 as a protective factor for excessive fat gain during therapy. Moreover, this haplotype 3 of the VDR 5'-promoter was determined as risk factor for a lower BM(A)D-LS at diagnosis that remained during ALL treatment. Carriage of ESR1 ( PvuII/XbaI ) haplotype 3 negatively influenced recovery of lean body mass after treatment discontinuation. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
