    "abstract_text": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) stem/progenitor cells and BCR-ABL + acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blast cells are insensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) monotherapies. These cells rapidly generate therapy-resistant clones in vitro and in vivo and are often responsible for disease relapse. Therefore, identification of predictive biomarkers and novel treatments that target key molecular events active in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are needed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small molecules that regulate the gene expression network and are highly deregulated in many cancers. Through global transcriptome profiling, we have recently identified 66 differentially expressed miRNAs in pre-treatment CD34 + stem/progenitor cells from CML patients (n=6) compared to healthy bone marrow (NBM) controls (n=3, adjusted P<0.05); 26 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between subsequent IM-nonresponders and IM-responders (P<0.05). 21 differentially expressed miRNAs were successfully validated in additional IM-responders (n=11), IM-nonresponders (n=11) and NBM (n=11). Interestingly, miR-185 was discovered to be one of the most highly deregulated miRNAs, with significant reduction in CD34 + cells from IM-nonresponders compared to IM-responders (p=0.0006). This significant change was further demonstrated in CD34 + cells from CML patients (n=60) before and after 3-month TKI nilotinib treatment in a clinical trial (p<0.05). We further demonstrated that miR-185 functions as a tumor suppressor; its restored expression by lentiviral transduction in CD34 + IM-nonresponder cells significantly impaired survival of these cells and sensitized them to TKI treatment in vitro . Restored miR-185 expression in BCR-ABL + ALL blasts led to a profound decrease in leukemia burden and significantly enhanced survival compared to controls in vivo (median survival 65 vs. 47 days, P=0.0005). Strikingly, mice injected with miR-185-transduced cells and treated with dasatinib (DA) survived much longer than recipients of control cells treated with DA (median survival 83 vs. 60 days, P=0.0018). Moreover, restoration of miR-185 expression combined with DA treatment greatly reduced in vivo long-term regenerative activity of LSCs from IM-nonresponders as compared to control cells treated with DA in NRG mice (<0.2% vs. 5% GFP + patient cells in the BM, 25 weeks post-transplantation). We observed not only a marked reduction in GFP + CD34 + cells, but also a near elimination of GFP + CD34 + CD38 - LSCs that were transduced with miR-185 and treated with DA compared to control cells treated with DA, indicating that restored miR-185 expression combined with DA preferentially prevents the growth of patient-derived long-term leukemia-initiating cells in vivo . Several miRNA target genes were further identified by integrating miRNA expression profiles with gene expression profiles from the same patient samples using strand-specific RNA-seq. Based on three out of six prediction algorithms ( mirBase , TargetScan , miRanda , tarBase , mirTarget2 , and PicTar ), PAK6, a serine/threonine-protein kinase, was found to be highly expressed in CD34 + IM-nonresponder cells compared to IM-responders (p<0.003), which correlated with reduced expression of miR-185 in these cells (p=0.0002). PAK6 was confirmed as a target gene of miR-185 by a luciferase reporter assay. Western blot analysis showed that restored miR-185 expression caused a marked decrease in protein levels of PAK6 in miR-185-transduced cells and suppression of PAK6 reduced viability of these cells. These results indicate that PAK6 is a critical target of miR-185, and that loss of miR-185 expression in CML may lead to up-regulation of PAK6, which in turn contributes to disease progression and drug resistance. Indeed, the use of a pre-clinically validated pan PAK inhibitor (PF-3758309) significantly inhibited the growth of IM-resistant cells and CD34 + IM-nonresponder cells and these effects could be enhanced by TKIs (p<0.05). Mechanistically, we observed that p-ERK and p-AKT were significantly reduced in PAK6 knockdown or miR185-restored IM-resistant cells in response to IM treatment. Thus, we infer that downregulation of PAK6 may sensitize TKI-resistant cells to TKI therapy through inhibition of the RAS/MAPK pathway. Taken together, PAK6, a novel target of miR-185, emerges as an attractive druggable target for combination therapy of TKI-resistant patients.
