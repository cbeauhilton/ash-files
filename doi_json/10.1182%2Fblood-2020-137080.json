    "abstract_text": "Introduction: No standard of care exists for patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (rrPMBCL). As such, pts typically receive therapies recommended for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with poor prognosis. Similar to classical Hodgkin lymphoma, rrPMBCL tumors often overexpress the programmed death 1 (PD-1) ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Data from the first full analysis of the phase 2 KEYNOTE (KN)-170 (NCT02576990) study showed that pembrolizumab provided effective and durable antitumor activity with a manageable safety profile in patients with rrPMBCL. These data led to the FDA approval of pembrolizumab for pts with rrPMBCL after \u22652 prior therapies. In this aggressive malignancy with few salvage options, duration of remission with PD-1 blockade remains a critical question. Here we present data from KN170 with an additional 24 months of follow-up in patients with rrPMBCL. Methods: Pts with rrPMBCL who had relapsed after or were ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant with \u22652 lines of prior therapy were enrolled in KN170 to receive 200 mg pembrolizumab IV Q3W until disease progression or toxicity, for up to 2 years. Tumor response was assessed Q12W with PET/CT scans by IWG 2007 criteria. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Exploratory endpoints included response by Lugano 2014 criteria. The data cutoff date for this analysis was May 7, 2020. Results: At the data cutoff date, among all treated pts (N=53), 13 had completed 2 years of treatment and 40 had discontinued largely due to progression (n=30). The ORR was 45% (24/53; 95% CI 32-60) with a CR rate of 19% (10/53; 13/53 [25%] by Lugano criteria). No patient who achieved CR by BICR had received consolidation therapy or had progressed at data cutoff. After a median study follow-up of 43.1 months (range, 35.6-50.7) the median DOR was not reached (range, 1.1+ to 46.9+ mo); 76% of pts had a response duration \u226536 mo. Median PFS was 5.5 mo (95% CI, 2.7-15.1), with 36-mo PFS rate of 34%. The median OS was 22.3 mo (95% CI, 7.3 to not reached) with 36-mo OS rate of 45%. At data cutoff, 50 (94%) pts had at least one adverse event (AE), with 30 (57%) having a treatment-related AE. The most common treatment-related AEs were neutropenia (19%), asthenia (9%), hypothyroidism (8%), fatigue (6%), and pyrexia (6%). Grade \u22653 treatment-related AEs occurred in 12 (23%) pts. Six (11%) pts had an immune-mediated AE. There were no treatment-related grade 5 events. Conclusion: Results from the longer-term follow-up of KN170, the largest prospective clinical trial in rrPMBCL, shows that pembrolizumab provides robust and durable antitumor activity with a manageable safety profile in patients with rrPMBCL.
