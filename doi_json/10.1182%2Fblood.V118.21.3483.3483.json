    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3483 Activated Hedgehog (HH) signaling was identified in our laboratory to contribute to cell survival, proliferation and chemotolerance of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (Leukemia 2010;24:1025 & Oncogene 2011, in press). The HH receptor complex is integrated by two main proteins, smoothened (SMO) and patched-1 (PTCH1). SMO is a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor that transduces HH signal to the cytoplasm and has glioma-associated oncogene homologue (GLI) proteins as major signaling transcription effectors. PTCH1 is a 12 transmembrane protein that inhibits SMO in the absence of HH ligands. Here, we investigated potential cross talk between SMO with the activation status of PI3K/AKT and NF-kB, two relevant oncogenic pathways in DLBCL. Using a small interfering (si)RNA approach and DLBCL cell lines of germinal center (GC) and activated B-cell (ABC) type we found that the expression levels of SMO modulate the activation status of AKT and canonical NF-KB pathways in DLBCL cells of GC type and mainly AKT in those of ABC type. In DLBCL cells of GC cell type, silencing SMO resulted in decrease of the phosphorylation levels of ser473 p-AKT and ser536 p-P65 and silencing PTCH1 resulted in increase of the phosphorylation levels of both proteins. The same silencing experimental approach in DLBCL cells of ABC type resulted in similar modulation in the activation status of the AKT but not, or to less extent, in the activation of NF-kB pathway. The modulation of the activation status of the NF-KB pathway was also confirmed using protein nuclear extracts and DNA binding ELISA assays. In cells of both DLBCL subtypes, silencing of the SMO transcriptional effector GLI1 showed no changes in the activation status of both pathways. The modulation in the activation status of AKT and NF-KB was also detected using SMO inhibitors, cyclopamine-KAAD and HhAntag (Genentech Inc) or activators, purmorphamine and recombinant HH protein. Combinatorial treatments with increasing concentrations of SMO inhibitors (cyclopamine and HhAntag [1.6, 3.2 and 4.8 \u03bcM]) with minimal lethal doses of Ly294002 (PI3K inhibitor) or BAY-11 (NF-KB inhibitor) were also performed. Using cell viability, and apoptosis (Annexin-V) assays, we found that combined treatments of PI3K or NF-KB inhibitors with a SMO inhibitor resulted in an additive/synergistic decrease of cell viability and increase of apoptosis in comparison to the treatments with SMO inhibitors alone. Taken together, our data shed novel light on the contribution of SMO on the activation of PI3K/AKT and NF-kB pathways in DLBCL. Our data also provide a rationale to use SMO inhibitors in combination with inhibitors of other oncogenic pathways such as PI3K/AKT and/or NF-KB for the treatment of patients with DLBCL.
