    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1738 Introduction: Hydroxycarbamide (HC) is an antimetabolite used as first-line therapy in high risk essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV). In treatment-naive patients, HC achieves complete hematological and partial molecular response in 80% and 50% of patients, respectively. Genetic factors involved in the pharmacokinetics of HC, as well as in the acquisition of the JAK2 V617F mutation, could play a role in the variability among these patients in achieving a molecular response. Objective: To assess the influence of 46/1 JAK2 haplotype and urea transporters polymorphisms on the molecular response in JAK2 V617F-positive PV and ET patients treated with HC. Methods: JAK2 V617F allele burden was measured by quantitative PCR at diagnosis and every 6 months during follow-up in 53 PV patients and in 41 ET patients receiving HC therapy. Molecular response to HC treatment was defined according to European LeukemiaNet (ELN) criteria. SNPs rs12340895 and rs12343867 were used to determine 46/1 haplotype status and SNPs rs2298720 (SLC14A1), rs9960464 (SLC14A2), were used to genotype urea transporters. The rate of molecular response was compared according to 46/1 JAK2 haplotype status (negative, heterozygous, homozygous), and genotype of 2 urea transporters: SLC14A1 (GG, GA, AA) and SLC14A2 (GG, GA, AA). The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Results: Overall, molecular response (CR or PR) was achieved in 48 patients (51%), corresponding to 46% and 57% in PV and ET patients, respectively (p=0.3). In ET patients, there were no significant differences in the proportion of patients achieving a molecular response according to 46/1 JAK2 haplotype or to the different transporter genotypes. PV patients with the GG genotype in transporter SLC14A2 obtained more frequently a molecular response than those with AA or GA genotype (71% versus 36%, p=0.03). No significant differences in molecular response were observed in PV patients according to transporter SLC14A1 and 46/1 JAK2 haplotype. Conclusion: 46/1 JAK2 haplotype status did not influence molecular response in PV or ET patients treated with HC. Polymorphisms in urea transporters showed a minimal effect on the rate of molecular response in these patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
