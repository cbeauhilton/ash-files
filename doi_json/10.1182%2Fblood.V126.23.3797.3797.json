    "abstract_text": "Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is an aggressive acute leukemia/lymphoma recently classified as a malignant transformation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). BPDCN has no standard treatment and a poor prognosis, with median survival <1 year. A significant roadblock to better understanding BPDCN is a lack of adequate model systems. We generated patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of BPDCN in NOD/Scid/IL2rg null (NSG) mice. Bone marrow or peripheral blood cells involved by BPDCN blasts (CD45 low, CD123 high, HLA-DR high, CD3 neg) were transplanted into irradiated NSG recipients. Nine of 16 BPDCNs caused lethal leukemia involving blood, spleen, and bone marrow 2-6 months after transplantation. All nine BPDCN PDXs were serially transplantable. Flow characterization of each patient's BPDCN and corresponding xenograft revealed no major differences in BDCA2, BDCA4, FCeR1, ILT7, or cytoplasmic TCL1 staining. All samples maintained high expression of the human interleukin-3 (IL3) receptor (IL3Ralpha/CD123), a hallmark feature of BPDCN. To further characterize BPDCN pathogenesis we performed whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) on sorted blasts from 11 patients and on normal pDCs isolated from 4 healthy donors. These were compared to RNA-seq in six PDXs. The spectrum of mutations in BPDCN transcriptomes overlapped with that seen in other hematologic malignancies, particularly myeloid disorders, and was similar to reported DNA mutations in BPDCN, including in ASXL1, CTCF, IDH2, NRAS, RUNX1, STAG2, TET2, and TP53. Particularly striking was the presence of a canonical mutation in an RNA splicing factor in 7 of 11 cases (SRSF2 P95H/L/R in four, ZRSR2 R295* and gene locus deletion in two, and SF3B1 K666N in one). Known oncogenic mutations in the original disease were retained in the PDXs, including all splicing factor mutations, with the exception of an IDH2 R140Q that was lost in one PDX. BPDCN PDXs grouped together in unsupervised clustering of expression profiles, distinct from AML and ALL PDXs in an analysis of 134 models from the DFCI Public Repository of Xenografts (http://PRoXe.org). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of KEGG and REACTOME pathways associated with differentially expressed genes between primary BPDCNs and non-malignant pDCs revealed signatures related to dendritic cell activation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. In addition, 3 of the top 11 sets were genes involved in mRNA processing, mRNA splicing, and processing capped intron-containing pre-mRNAs (all FDR<1e-6). To test the efficacy of BPDCN-targeted therapy using primary human leukemias in vivo , we performed a pre-clinical trial in NSG mice using SL-401, a recombinant biologic consisting of a fusion protein of IL3 and diphtheria toxin. Three independent BPDCN xenografts were injected into 20 NSG mice each, and followed by weekly peripheral blood monitoring for human CD45 and CD123. When leukemia burden reached >0.5% in at least half of the mice in the cohort, animals were randomized to receive SL-401 at 100 ug/kg or vehicle intraperitoneally daily for 5 days. Two mice in each group were sacrificed at day 7 for response assessment, and peripheral blood was followed weekly in the remaining mice for evidence of progression (>5% human CD45/CD123-positive cells). 7 days after treatment, mice receiving SL-401 had dramatic reductions in BPDCN in the peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow (0.31% vs 37.6% in marrow of SL-401 vs vehicle). SL-401 prolonged progression-free survival in all BPDCNs tested (12 vs 48 days, P<0.0001 by log-rank test). At the time of progression after SL-401, relapsing mice were re-randomized to receive a 2 nd and in some cases 3 rd cycle of SL-401 or vehicle. Repeated treatment in mice that progressed after SL-401 resulted in second and third peripheral blood remissions. All PDXs responded to SL-401 including those with and without splicing factor and TP53 mutations. CD123 expression was maintained at high levels on all SL-401 treated BPDCNs even after repeated cycles. Primary xenografts of BPDCN are faithful models of the human disease, maintain genetic and transcriptomic characteristics of the original tumor, and respond to multiple courses of IL3-DT in vivo, suggesting that they provide a valuable resource to study disease biology and response/resistance to targeted therapy.
