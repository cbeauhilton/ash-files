    "abstract_text": "In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a rare subset of leukemic stem cells (LSC) persists in patients responding to conventional tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. The failure to eradicate these LSCs results in indefinite therapy dependence and a risk of leukemic relapse. However, the conventional LSC compartment (Lin-CD34+CD38-) is highly heterogeneous where only a subpopulation is believed to be functional, TKI-insensitive LSCs. Previously, using single-cell gene expression analysis we characterized the heterogeneity within the LSC population (Lin-CD34+CD38-) in CML patients using a selected panel of 96 primers. Interestingly, by comparing LSC heterogeneity at diagnosis with the heterogeneity following 3 months of TKI therapy we uncovered a therapy-insensitive, quiescent subpopulation, which could be isolated at high-purity using a combination of the surface markers: Lin-CD34+CD38-CD45RA-cKIT-CD26+ (Warfvinge, Geironson, Sommarin et al., 2017). Here, we expand the single-cell analysis of CML LSC populations to include combined immunophenotype-/RNA sequencing analysis (CITE-seq). CITE-seq allows for unbiased, further in-depth transcriptome analysis as wells as immunophenotypic characterization by pre-staining cells with a panel of DNA-barcoded antibodies prior to sequencing. DNA-barcoded antibodies convert the protein expression into readable sequences through unique oligo-conjugates as identifiers. Using CITE-seq with a panel of 44 distinct surface markers designed to immunophenotypically differentiate between stem/progenitors cells and leukemic clones we simultaneously characterize the molecular and immunophenotypic heterogeneity within Lin-CD34+/Lin-CD34+CD38- CML stem/progenitor compartment at diagnosis. Additionally by comparing the LSCs transcriptome from patients with different therapeutic outcome after 12 months of therapy we describe how differences in heterogeneity and the presence of immunophenotypic therapy-insensitive LSCs at diagnosis (Lin-CD34+CD38-CD45RA-cKIT-CD26+) contribute to therapy response.
