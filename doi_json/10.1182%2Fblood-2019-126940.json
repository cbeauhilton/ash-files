    "abstract_text": "Background: Ino showed significant activity in phase II trials in pts with R/R ALL, that was subsequently confirmed in Phase III trial where Ino demonstrated higher response rates and superior overall survival vs standard of care chemotherapy (SOC) in adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R ALL).Ph-like or BCR-ABL1-like ALL possesses a gene expression profile similar to that of BCR-ABL1 ALL but lacks the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. It is characterized by increased expression of hematopoietic stem-cell genes, deletion of B-cell lineage genes and kinase-activating alterations. Ph-like ALL is associated with refractoriness to standard induction/consolidation chemotherapy and poor prognosis. Aim: To evaluate the outcomes of pts with R/R Ph-like ALL treated in phase II trial with Ino monotherapy. Methods: We performed an integrated analysis of whole genome sequencing (to identify sequence mutations, structural variations and DNA copy number alterations), and transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq; to quantify gene expression, determine Ph-like gene expression profile and identify fusions) on 53 patients' samples treated with Ino between June 2010 and September 2012. Results: Fifty-three evaluable pts with R/R ALL with stored baseline samples were analyzed. Pts characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Median age was 50 years. Ino was given as Salvage 1, Salvage 2, and Salvage 3 and beyond in 20 (38%), 18 (34%), and 15 (28%) pts, respectively. Figure 1 reflects the different genomic subgroups identified among 53 evaluable pts. Ph-like gene signature was found in 12 pts (22.6%). Among these 12 pts, 6 had IGH-CRLF2, 2 IGH - EPOR, 1 SNX2-ABL1, and 3 had no fusions identified. The overall response rates (ORR) were 54% [complete remission (CR) 20%, CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) 32%, and marrow CR (CRi) 2%]. Among pts with morphologic remission, 46% and 82% achieved minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity at CR and at any time, respectively. The ORR for pts with Ph-like ALL, Ph-positive ALL, ALL with KMT2A, and others were 58% (CR=25%; CRh=33%), 42% (CR=8%; CRh=33%), 57% (CR=14%; CRh=29%; CRi=14%), and 56% (CR=26%; CRh=30%), respectively. The respective overall MRD negativity rates were 71%, 100%, 75%, and 83% (Table 1). The median follow-up was 60 months. The median event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.3 and 5.4 months, respectively. There was no difference in EFS and OS between the subgroups analyzed (P=0.464; P=0.824). The median EFS and OS were 4.5 and 4.5 months for pts with Ph-like, 3.1 and 7.2 months for those with Ph-positive ALL, 2.8 and 4.4 months for those with KMT2A, and 2.2 and 4.6 months for others (Table 1). 21 (40%) pts had subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplant; 6 (50%), 3 (25%), 4 (57%), and 8 (36%) in each subgroup, respectively. The rate of VOD was 3 (6%) with no difference among different subgroups. Conclusion: The current analysis suggest that Ino therapy may overcome the impact of Ph-like phenotype in pts with ALL. Confirmation of these findings in a larger cohort and in frontline ALL patients is needed.
