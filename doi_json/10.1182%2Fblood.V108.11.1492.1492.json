    "abstract_text": "Dengue virus causes febrile illnesses: Dengue Fever (DF) and less frequently a life-threatening illness, Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF). The pathophysiology of hemostatic defect in dengue infection is thought to relate to the direct effect of virus or cytokines on endothelial activation. To study the state of endothelial activation during dengue infection, we measured plasma levels of von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag), vWF-collagen binding assay (vWF:CBA), and ADAMTS 13 activity in 42 children (20 with DF and 22 with DHF) during 3 phases of illness: febrile, toxic, and convalescent phase. 38 healthy children comprised as controls. Our data shows that both VWF:Ag and vWF:CBA levels were significantly higher in dengue patients (p \u2264 0.001 in both DF and DHF patients) versus controls. DHF patients had significantly higher of VWF: Ag (p = 0.01, versus DF). ADAMTS 13 activity levels were significantly decreased only in DHF patients during 3 phases of the illness (febrile; mean 78%; p = 0.016, toxic; mean 68%; p<0.001 and convalescent; mean 69%; p<0.001 compared to mean 104% of the controls). Compared to DF patients, DHF patients had significantly lower plasma concentrations of ADAMTS 13 activity during the febrile, toxic and convalescent phase (p = 0.039, p = 0.002 and p =0.003, respectively). Endothelial cell activation is a hallmark of dengue infection especially in DHF patients; indicated by a significant rise in VWF:Ag and vWF:CBA and a reciprocal decline in ADAMTS 13 activity.",
