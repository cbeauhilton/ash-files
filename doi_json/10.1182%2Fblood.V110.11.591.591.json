    "abstract_text": "Our previous study has demonstrated that tetra-arsenic tetra-sulfide (As 4 S 4 ) treatment alone is highly effective and safe in both induction and maintenance therapy in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients ( Lu DP et al, Blood  2002 ; 99 : 3136 ). In current clinical study, we explored whether As 4 S 4 combined sequentially or simultaneously with all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA) and cytotoxic agents according to specific clinical condition as the first line therapy could expedite complete remission (CR) but in a safer way and further improve disease-free survival (DFS). The treatment-related toxicities were also studied. From April 2001 to May 2007, 114 patients with APL in a median age of 32.5 years (10\u201373 years) were enrolled including consecutive 68 newly diagnosed cases and 46 patients in hematological remission. For induction therapy, both As 4 S 4 (60 mg/kg) and, if leukocytosis or retinoid acid syndrome was not a risk, ATRA (25mg/m 2 ) were taken orally per day till CR. Cytotoxic agents such as mitoxantrone and/or hydroxyurea were added when WBC counts were more than 4 \u00d7 10 9 /L. After hematological remission, 4 to 6 cycles of combined chemotherapy were given, and followed by alternatively oral use of As 4 S 4 (3 cycles) and ATRA (1 cycle) in outpatient base for maintenance therapy until 4 years after diagnosis. PML/RARa transcript was monitored quantitatively by real-time PCR. Arsenic levels in blood and urine were also monitored with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Consecutive 68 newly diagnosed patients all achieved complete hematological remission in a median time of 29.5 days (14 \u2013 62 days) without early death. The median time to achieve molecular remission was 61.5 days (34 \u2013 120 days). Four out of 114 patients relapsed. One of them had obtained CR again. One patient died from leukemia relapse. Treatment with As 4 S 4 containing regimen was well tolerated. Mild gastrointestinal discomfort, transient elevation in liver enzyme, rash, and edema were noted in a few cases. Estimated DFS rate for 4 years was 94%, with a median follow-up time of 36.5 months (3\u201376 months). Our encouraging results show that faster consecutive CR, higher DFS rate and better quality of life have been achieved with the above regimen as the first line therapy for APL patients.",
