Since specific genetic alterations have not yet been defined, this myeloid neoplasm (MN) remains clinicopathologically assigned. The WHO classification addresses the difficulties concerning the differential diagnosis between APMF, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with excess of blasts and concomitant fibrosis (RAEB-F) and acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AMGL). Methods Our files were searched for patients with rapid-onset MN without a prior history of a myeloproliferative neoplasm or a MDS fulfilling the 2008 WHO criteria of APMF. An age- and gender-matched control group of RAEB-F cases with multilineage dysplasia was retrieved for comparison. Our approach included: i) the careful review of morphological, clinical and laboratory data with special regard to the proportion of immature CD34 + precursors/blasts in bone marrow (BM) biopsies; ii) the grading of BM fibrosis according to the European consensus guidelines; iii) the analysis of the JAK2-V617F , the MPL W515L and the GATA1 mutational status, the cytoplasmic localization of nucleophosphamin1 (NPM1) in BM blasts, and the expression the inhibitor of differentiation protein-2 (Id2) in hematopoietic and stroma cells; iv) the evaluation of the prognostic relevance of these parameters. Results Fifty-four patients (32 males, 22 females) with a median age of 66, 9 years from our institutions were diagnosed APMF. Sufficient DNA for allele specific PCR for JAK2 genotyping was obtained from paraffin-embedded EDTA-decalcified BMB specimens from 22 APMF and 14 RAEB-F patients. In addition, an analysis of MPL W515L and GATA1 mutations was performed on 15 APMF cases. The relevant clinicopathological and molecular data are summarized in the table.  . . APMF . RAEB-F .

GATA1 + (%)  0 n.d. * CI: 95% confidence interval View Large Semiquantitative evaluation revealed a decreased expression level of Id2 in erythropoiesis of the APMF samples, while Id2 was increased in the stromal compartment. Within the total APMF cohort, patients aged \u226460 years had a longer OS (p=0,013). A comparison between the Kaplan-Meier curves of the APMF patients who underwent hematopietic cell transplantation (HCT) with those treated by conventional chemotherapy clearly showed that HCT significantly improved OS (median survival 6,1 vs. 11,1 months, p=0,005). Within the non-transplanted group, a bone marrow blast count \u226425% was associated with a longer OS (p=0,006). Conclusions Our results point to significant differences between APMF and RAEB-F with regard to OS, MCV, LDH, BM fibrosis and BM blast cells. We detected a higher frequency of mutated JAK2 V616F in the MB samples than generally reported in the literature for other categories of AML or MDS. However, the JAK2 V617F mutation status or an aberrant cytoplasmic NPM1 localization were both not predictive of outcome. In contrast to data published for AMGL, no association between a MPL W515L mutation and APMF was observed. Survival was significantly worse in APMF than in RAEB-F. A rapid diagnosis based on a multiparameter approach and a proper management including the option of HCT even in elderly patients seems mandatory for APMF patients. Targeting the fibrotic BM microenvironment which is characterized by an increased Id2 expression may be considered for future therapeutic strategies. Disclosures Skoda: Genentech Inc.: Consultancy."
