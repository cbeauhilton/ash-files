    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Determining the optimal post-remission management for elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a challenge. AML is primarily a disease of the elderly with >60% of newly diagnosed patients aged 60 years and older. For younger AML patients, post-remission therapy in the form of high-dose cytarabine (HIDAC) consolidation or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is critical in maintaining durable disease control and improving survival. However, post-remission HIDAC in elderly AML patients is associated with higher rates of neurotoxicity and decreased survival benefit compared to younger patients. The optimal post-remission therapy for elderly AML patients remains undefined. The objective of this study is to determine the outcomes of using varying doses (0.25-3 g/m 2 ) of cytarabine as post-remission consolidation therapy in an elderly AML population. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of AML patients aged 60 years and older treated with cytarabine as consolidation therapy at UPMC Hillman Cancer Center between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2014. Patients were excluded if they were not in complete morphologic remission prior to proceeding with cytarabine consolidation or if they proceeded directly to HSCT after consolidation therapy. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was measured from the time of post-induction bone marrow biopsy confirming remission to the date of relapse or death. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the duration from diagnostic bone marrow biopsy confirming AML diagnosis to the date of death. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the survival distributions and log-rank test was used to compare survival functions from groups. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazard regression to determine the relationship of RFS and OS to patient's age, cytogenetic risk group, AML type (de novo vs secondary AML), transplant status, cytarabine dosage and number of cycles. All data was analyzed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Results: Out of 156 identified patients, 121 were eligible for analysis. Median age at diagnosis was 66 years (range 59-78) with 77 (64%) male patients. Thirty-six patients (30%) had secondary AML. Cytogenetic abnormalities were favorable in 7 (6%), intermediate in 86 (71%), unfavorable in 24 (20%), and unknown in 4 (3%) patients. Cytarabine was administered at a mean dose of 1.44 g/m 2 (range 0.25-3.0, SD 0.84) and a median number of cycles of 4 (range 1-4). One patient (0.8%) developed reversible grade 3 neurotoxicity during cycle 2 at a dose of 2 g/m 2 with ataxia, dysmetria, and tremors. For all patients, the median RFS was 12.5 months (95% CI 9.7-15.6). Median RFS was significantly different among the cytogenetic risk groups (p=0.0008 via log-rank test): favorable-risk RFS had not been reached because most subjects were in remission and alive at time of analysis, intermediate-risk RFS 13.6 months (95% CI 11.0-17.3), unfavorable-risk RFS 8.3 months (95% CI 3.5-8.9). In this study population, the median OS was 20.5 months (95% CI 16.4-27.1). Median OS was significantly different among the cytogenetic risk groups (p=0.003 via log-rank test): favorable-risk OS 131.3 months (95% CI 12.9-upper limit not reached), intermediate-risk OS 25.1 months (95% CI 18.9-39.4), and unfavorable-risk OS 10.8 months (95% CI 10.4-15.8). Average cytarabine dose did not significantly correlate with RFS or OS in the model. Multivariate analysis revealed a 27% decreased rate of relapse (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.92, p=0.008), and 24% decreased mortality rate (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.96, p=0.024) with each additional cytarabine cycle given. Conclusions: Our study supports the use of cytarabine as a tolerable and effective option for post-remission therapy in elderly AML patients, particularly those with favorable-risk cytogenetics. Each additional cycle administered was associated with improved RFS and OS rates in this study population. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
