    "abstract_text": "Conventional therapies to multiple myeloma (MM) are not aimed at specific molecular targets leading ultimately to treatment resistance. Recent reports have shown that iron is instrumental in cancer development and progression and that high intracellular iron levels are associated with poor prognosis. We have demonstrated that MM cells exhibit dysregulated iron homeostasis and that limitation of cytosolic iron inhibits MM cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. The potential therapeutic role of iron should be further investigated to better understand how targeting high-iron MM cells could prevent or delay MM development and recurrence. Our study will provide crucial insights into the iron biology of MM pathogenesis and may lead to novel MM therapy. In this study, two mouse models, young Vk*MYC and old KaLwRij mice, were injected with iron dextran (1.25 mg/kg, IP, once a week). Tumor burden was monitored by serial Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP) tests, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry. In vitro co-culturing of ARP1 MM cells with macrophages was employed to determine iron transfer. To determine iron's roles in MM evolution, we injected iron dextran into Vk*MYC mice at 8-week age. Vk*MYC mice develop MGUS around 40-50 weeks with plasma cell (PC) bone marrow infiltration and kidney damage etc. Iron-dextran was used because it is primarily taken up by macrophages. After 14-16 weeks of iron injection, M spike was detected in the injected Vk*MYC mice. The percentage of bone marrow plasma cells (CD138 + ) were significantly increased to 9% in the Vk*MYC mice injected with iron compared to control mice injected with vehicle by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. The acceleration of disease progression via iron injection was also tested in KaLwRij mice, which also spontaneously develops MGUS in old age. M protein was detected in 12 of 15 mice (80%) injected with iron dextran for 10 weeks and 1 of 5 KaLwRij (20%) control mice at 18-months of age. CD138 + B220 - plasma cells were determined by flow cytometry. A significant increase of CD138 + B220 - plasma cells in iron treated mice (4% versus 2%) was observed compared to vehicle control mice. Deparaffined sections of bone marrow from the above mice were stained with Prussian blue and confirmed positive staining of macrophages from iron administrated mice. These results indicate that iron accelerates MGUS development in vivo . We next evaluated whether MM cells accumulate iron from the microenvironment. ARP1 MM cells were co-cultured with primary macrophages derived from mouse bone marrow to mimic disease environment in vitro . Under these conditions, MM cells induced macrophage polarization from M0 to M1 and M2. Furthermore, increased macrophage polarization was confirmed in vivo from the KaLwRij mice injected with 5TGM1 MM cells. To confirm that MM cells uptake iron from macrophages, increased intracellular ferritin levels were observed by western blot in ARP1 MM cells following co-culture with iron-loaded macrophages. We observed that this increase in intracellular ferritin was mediated via the transferrin receptor. This iron mobilization was prevented by iron chelation. Additionally, we confirmed that ferritin levels were higher in CD138 + primary human MM cells compared to CD138 - non-MM cells by western blot. Our data indicate that MM cells promote macrophage polarization resulting in the transferring of iron into MM cells. The blockade of iron trafficking between MM cells and macrophages might hold a promise for the prevention and therapy in MM.
