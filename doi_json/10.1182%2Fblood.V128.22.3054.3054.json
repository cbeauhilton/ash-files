    "abstract_text": "Background : Post Transplant Lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) represents a distinct and rare complication following solid organ transplantation (SOT). Insight into the biology of this disorder is limited to retrospective reviews and case series. In one of the first reports for post-transplant Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (PT-DLBCL) cases, we demonstrated a higher incidence and improved outcomes in PT-DLBCL non-germinal center B-cell (non-GCB) subtype compared to PT-DLBCL germinal center B-cell (GCB) Subtype. Published data suggests immunocompetent DLBCL non-GCB subtypes are less common and fare worse than immunocompetent GCB DLBCL. The reason for this unexpected finding in our PT-DLBCL pts is not fully understood. Recently Kiyasu and colleagues demonstrated that PD-L1 overexpression was significantly associated with non-GCB DLBCL, EBV virus positivity and poor prognosis in immunocompetent DLBCL samples. Therefore based on this we hypothesized that PT-DLBCL non-GCB subtype may have negative PD-L1 overexpression thus possibly accounting for improved outcomes compared to their immunocompetent counterparts. Hence we sought to test PD-L1 expression in our samples with PT-DLBCL. Methods : With IRB approval, we retrospectively identified PT- DLBCL patients treated at the University of Colorado between Jan 1989 to April 2015. We retrieved formalin fixed paraffin embedded PT-DLBCL tissue specimens and determined cell of origin by the Hans Algorithm. We assessed PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry. PD-L1 positive PT-DLBCL was defined as 30% of more of the lymphoma cells showing distinct membranous and or cytoplasmic staining. In addition EBER-ISH was performed to assess EBV status. Results: 86 adult SOT pts with PTLD were treated at our institution. 75 of 86 pts (87%) had monomorphic histology. Among monomorphic PTLD, 64% (48 of 75) had DLBCL. The median age at transplantation was 49.5 yrs (5-74 yrs). Median time from SOT to PTLD was 37 mos (1.4-499). The most common transplanted organ included kidney (40%), liver (38%), lung (13%) and heart (9%). 31% had early PTLD (12mos of SOT). 60% were EBV positive. 77% with early PTLD and 49% with late PTLD were EBV positive. Due to a paucity of archived tissue blocks, IHC staining was applied to 32/48 samples with DLBCL. Non-GCB subtype was identified in 75% (24/32) samples and GCB subtype in 25% (8/32) samples. Of the 48 pts with PT-DLBCL histology, PD-L1 stain was performed on 18 samples. Of the 18 PT-DLBCL samples, 77% (14/18) had non-GCB subtype and 16% (3/18) had GCB subtype. PD-L1 expression was negative in 78% (11/14) and positive in 22% (3/14) of non-GCB DLBCL samples. PD-L1 expression was negative in 100% (3/3) of GCB DLBCL samples. The sample size was too small to effectively describe the survival experience of pt subsets. Using Fisher's exact test we found no evidence to support an association between EBV Status and PDL1 expression (p-value 0.316). Conclusions : We previously reported in our consecutive series of PTLD after SOT an increased incidence and improved survival in pts with PT-DLBCL non-GCB subtype (ASH 2015) compared to PT-DLBCL GCB subtype. The reason for this is not fully understood. However, our limited series reveals that a majority of pts with PT- DLBCL non-GCB subtype was negative for PD-L1 overexpression. This might explain the improved outcomes in the PT-DLBCL non-GCB population. Despite a small sample size it is also interesting to note that 100% pts with PT-DLBCL GCB subtype were negative for PD-L1 overexpression. In the era of immunotherapy further studies in larger patient cohorts are warranted in order to understand the unique biology and outcomes of PT-DLBCL since it may have therapeutic implications.
