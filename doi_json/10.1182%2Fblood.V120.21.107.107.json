    "abstract_text": "Abstract 107 The considerable genetic predisposition to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is only partially accounted for by known genetic risk variants. Genome-wide association studies investigating hundreds of thousands of common single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified a number of associations, but missing heritability remains. Rare (i.e. minor allele frequency below 1%) and low-frequency (i.e. minor allele frequency below 5%) SNVs of the coding area may be responsible for at least part of this missing heritability. In order to investigate this, we sequenced 700,000 base pairs of genomic DNA including the protein coding exons and intron-exon boundaries of 186 hemostatic/pro-inflammatory genes. Indexed genomic DNA libraries were co-captured on NimbleGen HD2 2.1M-probe chips and capture products were sequenced on SOLiD 4 platforms. More than 70 billion base-pairs of raw sequence data were produced to sequence the target area with a median redundancy of 45X in 94 thrombophilia-negative patients with DVT and 98 controls. Most of the 4366 SNVs identified were rare, novel and nonsynonymous indicating pathogenetic potential. We tested the association of coding SNVs in the ADAMTS13 and VWF genes, encoding two interconnected proteins with fundamental roles in hemostasis. Sequencing of the two genes yielded 109 variants, 108 SNVs and a c.8241_8442del frameshift deletion in exon 51 of VWF. Being a carrier of rare coding (prevalence in DVT: 17% [n=16]; prevalence in controls 4% [n=4]; odds ratio [OR]: 4.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6\u201315.0), rare nonsynonymous (prevalence in DVT: 11% [n=10]; prevalence in controls 3% [n=3]; OR: 3.8; 95% CI: 1.0\u201314.2) or low-frequency coding (prevalence in DVT: 36% [n=34]; prevalence in controls 23% [n=23]; OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.0\u20133.5) SNVs of ADAMTS13 was associated with DVT. Carrying rare or low-frequency SNVs of VWF was not associated with DVT. The 11 different rare missense variants of ADAMTS13 found in DVT patients had never been described in association with congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Patients carrying at least one ADAMTS13 mutation of the categories associated with DVT had lower plasmatic levels of ADAMTS13 activity compared to patients without mutations. The change in ADAMTS13 activity was \u22127% (95% CI: \u221224 to 10%) for patients with rare coding ADAMTS13 mutations, \u221212% (95% CI: \u221230 to 6%) for patients with rare nonsynonymous mutations and \u221229% (95% CI: \u221252 to \u22126%) for patients with missense mutations predicted to be damaging for protein function by SIFT. Our results uncover for the first time a link between ADAMTS13, an important regulator of hemostasis implicated in microvascular thrombosis, and DVT.
