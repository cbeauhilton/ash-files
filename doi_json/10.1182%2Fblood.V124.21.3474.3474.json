    "abstract_text": "The CD38 molecule, with its high expression on Multiple Myeloma (MM), is considered a suitable target for antibody therapy of MM. We developed daratumumab (DARA), a human CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAb) with direct and Fc-mediated cell killing activity. DARA induces killing of tumor cells, mainly via complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (de Weers M. J Immunol 2011), and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) by macrophages (both murine and human). In addition, DARA induces apoptosis upon secondary cross-linking and modulates CD38 enzymatic function. DARA is currently in phase I, II and III clinical evaluation in patients with MM. Besides DARA, several other anti-CD38 mAb are in development; SAR650894 (SAR; clone 38SB19; Sanofi-Aventis) for MM and other CD38+ hematological malignancies, MOR03087 (MOR; Morphosys) for relapsed/refractory MM and Ab79 (Millenium/Takeda) which is in preclinical development. Similar mechanisms of action (MoA) are described for these mAb; nevertheless direct comparison studies would be critical for differentiation among these antibodies. . In this study, the efficacy of these anti-CD38 mAb was directly compared to DARA with respect to binding, apoptosis, CD38 ectoenzyme activity, and the induction of ADCC, ADCP and CDC. Surrogate antibodies of MOR, SAR and Ab79 were generated on the basis of protein sequences, as published in their corresponding patents families, and were attached to the backbone of DARA. Binding to CD38 expressing Daudi tumor cells was assessed by flow cytomery. All CD38 antibodies showed similar EC50 (~0.1 \u00b5g/mL) and maximal binding, except MOR which showed a lower apparent affinity (~0.3 \u00b5g/mL). Previously, CD38 amino acid residues Q272 and S274 were reported as critical for DARA binding. ELISA analyses using CD38 point mutants revealed MOR, SAR and Ab79 not to be affected by mutation of these residues. All CD38 mAb were equally potent in inducing ADCC of Daudi cells (40-60% lysis, 0.02 \u00b5g/mL), in classic Cr 51 -release ADCC assay using human PBMC effector cells (E:T ratio 100:1). Important differences were observed with respect to induction of CDC. SAR was unable to induce CDC in Daudi cells at concentrations up to 30 \u00b5g/mL, while DARA induced more than 80% lysis at concentrations above 1 \u00b5g/mL. Ab79 and MOR induced CDC, yet maximum lysis was 50% and 20%, respectively. Evaluation of Annexin V/propidium iodide (AnnV/PI) staining and activation of caspase-3 showed that only SAR induced AnnV/PI+ in Ramos cells (~40%) after 48 h exposure without Fc crosslinking, but did not activate caspase-3. In the presence of Fc crosslinking antibodies, all anti-CD38 mAb induced AnnV/PI+, caspase-3 mediated apoptosis. In enzyme activity assays using purified CD38 protein, SAR inhibited generation of cGDPR (indicative of the combined CD38 cyclase activity generating fluorescent cGDPR and hydrolase activity converting cGDPR into GDPR)more effectively than DARA (~70% vs. ~20% inhibition at 30 \u00b5g/mL). Ab79 had a modest effect on CD38 enzyme activity (~10% inhibition). MOR did not affect CD38 enzyme activity at all. The capacity to induce ADCP was only tested for DARA, MOR and Ab79 using mouse macrophages (m\u03c6) as effector cells and Daudi target cells. m\u03c6, isolated and matured from bone marrow cells, and calcein-AM labelled target cells (E:T ratio 1:1) were cultured in the presence of 0.0006-5 \u00b5g/mL antibody for 4 h. Non-phagocytosed target cells and m\u03c6 were collected and ADCP was evaluated by flow cytometry. All CD38 mAb induced m\u03c6-mediated phagocytosis, as observed by a concentration dependent increase in the number of double positive m\u03c6 and killing of target cells. Ab79 was as effective as DARA (EC50 ~0.01 \u00b5g/mL) in ADCP induction, whereas MOR was less effective (EC50 0.04 \u00b5g/mL). In summary, DARA and surrogate mAb of MOR, SAR and Ab79 showed similar binding to cells and induced similar amounts of ADCC. Differences between these mAb involved the ability to directly induce apoptosis, to inhibit the enzymatic activity of CD38 and to induce ADCP. The most striking difference was observed for the ability to induce CDC, the MoA which is currently believed the most important mechanism of MM cell killing in the clinic. DARA efficiently induced high levels of CDC at low concentrations, whereas the other CD38 mAb were unable or less capable to induce CDC.
