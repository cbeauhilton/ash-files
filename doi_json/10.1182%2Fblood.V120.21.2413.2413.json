    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2413 Somatic mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 are common in normal karyotype AML as well as in other clonal myeloid disorders and several solid tumors. Mutant IDH overproduces the R -enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate, ( R )-2HG (Dang, et al Nature 462: 739, 2009), which is hypothesized to alter the epigenetic landscape of cancer cells by inhibiting the activity of \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes, including the TET family of 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases and the jumonji-domain-containing family of histone demethylases. There is considerable interest in developing inhibitors of mutant IDH in the hope that, by decreasing ( R )-2HG production in cancer cells, their epigenetic regulation can be restored. However, there is, to date, no evidence that transformation by mutant IDH is reversible or that inhibiting production of ( R )-2HG has any effect on cancers harboring IDH mutations. Herein we report that in two different myeloid transformation assays, transformation by ( R )-2HG and mutant IDH1 is reversible by removal of ( R )-2HG. We previously reported that stable expression of a tumor-derived mutant IDH1 (IDH1R132H) induces growth factor independence and blocks EPO-induced differentiation in the human TF-1 erythroleukemia cell line, and that treatment of TF-1 cells with a cell-permeable form of ( R )-2HG, TFMB-( R )-2HG, is sufficient to recapitulate this phenotype (Late Breaking Abstract #LBA-4, ASH 2011). We have extended these studies and found that transformation by TFMB-( R )-2HG is reversible and that this reversibility is influenced by the duration and intensity (dose) of ( R )-2HG exposure. We developed a second myeloid transformation assay using a murine myeloid leukemia cell line that is transformed by expression of a HoxB8-ER fusion protein when cultured in the presence of estrogen. Upon estrogen withdrawal, the cells undergo monocytic differentiation and apoptosis. We expressed wild-type IDH1 or IDH1R132H in the cells and found that cells expressing wild-type IDH1 differentiate normally, but cells expressing IDH1R132H do not upregulate monocytic markers CD11b/Mac1 and Gr1 upon estrogen withdrawal. Furthermore, treatment of the IDH1R132H-expressing cells with an inhibitor of mutant IDH1 restores their ability to undergo monocytic differentiation upon estrogen withdrawal. Our findings suggest that continued exposure to ( R )-2HG is required to maintain the cellular changes induced by mutant IDH, and further suggest that targeting ( R )-2HG production may have therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of cancers harboring IDH mutations.
