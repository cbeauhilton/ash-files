    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2963 Background: The immunomodulatory agents thalidomide (THAL), lenalidomide (LEN), and pomalidomide (POM) have significant activity in a wide range of hematologic cancers. THAL is primarily a potent anti-angiogenic agent with minimal immunomodulatory activity. LEN and POM both demonstrate significant immunomodulatory activity. Additionally, POM displays anti-myeloma activity in patients with LEN-resistant multiple myeloma (MM). Recently, modulation of cereblon (CRBN)-bound E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes has been implicated in the mechanisms of action of THAL, LEN, and POM. This has enabled rational development of a next generation of compounds. CC-122 is a non-phthalimide analog of the immunomodulatory drugs and a first in class PPM\u2122 pleiotropic pathway modulator that binds the CRBN-DDB1-Cul4-Roc1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This study investigated the anti-proliferative, immunomodulatory, and anti-angiogenic activity of CC-122 in MM and lymphoma cells. Results: CC-122 inhibited proliferation of H929 MM cells in a CRBN-dependent and dose-dependent manner (IC 50 = 43 nM). CC-122 induced cell cycle arrest at G 0 /G 1 stage, which was associated with reduced retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation, and increased CDK inhibitor p27 protein expression. CC-122 also inhibited the growth of LEN-resistant H929 cells, although the proliferation IC 50 for CC-122 was relatively higher in LEN-resistant cells vs H929 control cells (Table). CC-122 has significant anti-myeloma activity, and has greater activity in LEN-resistant H929 cells vs LEN and POM. Compared with LEN, CC-122 had a greater anti-proliferative effect in diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Furthermore, CC-122 had greater anti-proliferative effects in ABC- and PBML-subtypes compared with GCB subtype lines. In ABC-subtype U2932 and OCI-Ly10-DLBCL cell lines, 10 \u03bcM CC-122 treatment significantly inhibited DNA-binding of NF-\u03baB p65 ( P < .001), p50 subunits ( P < .05), and IRF4 in a CRBN-dependent manner. In vivo anticancer activity of CC-122 was demonstrated in xenograft models of human lymphoma and MM. CC-122 exhibits potent immunomodulatory activity in whole blood, T, and natural killer (NK) cells. Additionally, CC-122 enhanced the anti-CD3 mAb-stimulated T-cell production of IL-5, IL-13, GM-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, RANTES, and TNF-\u03b1. The immunomodulatory activity of CC-122 was 10-fold more potent vs LEN. We investigated the anti-angiogenic properties of CC-122. In a human umbilical artery sprout outgrowth assay, CC-122 inhibited new vessel growth as well as endothelial cell migration and invasion. It also inhibited endothelial cell sprout formation and migration in a growth factor-induced endothelial cell migration and invasion assay. CC-122 has significantly greater anti-angiogenic activity compared with the LEN and POM in human angiogenesis assays (Table). In contrast, it has less of an anti-platelet effect as measured by megakaryocyte proliferation vs LEN and POM. CRBN binding competition assays were conducted with THAL-binding beads. As demonstrated by the higher IC 50 concentration, CC-122 has less potency with regard to CRBN binding compared with LEN or POM. Conclusion: Together, these data demonstrate that the first-in-class PPM\u2122 CC-122 has anti-proliferative, immunomodulatory, and anti-angiogenic properties that may have clinical significance in the treatment of advanced refractory lymphoproliferative disorders and is currently in Phase I studies. Furthermore the data suggest that the potency of binding to CRBN per se does not explain the broad pleiotropic activity of CC-122. Table: Activities of LEN, POM, and CC-122  Activity .
