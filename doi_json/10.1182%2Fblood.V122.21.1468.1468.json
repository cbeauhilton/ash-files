    "abstract_text": "Since residual chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) stem cells may be a cause of relapse after Imatinib (IM) cessation, targeting these IM-resistant stem cells is mandatory for complete cure of this disease. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP\u03b2), a leucine zipper transcription factor, promotes both cell cycle progression and differentiation toward granulocytes in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells under stress conditions such as infection. We have recently reported that C/EBP\u03b2 was upregulated in leukemic stem/progenitor cells derived from patients in chronic phase of CML (CP-CML) through STAT5, a major downstream target of BCR-ABL. In CML mouse model, C/EBP\u03b2 enhanced exhaustion of CML stem cells through promoting their differentiation (Hayashi Y et al, Leukemia 2013). In spite of the upregulation of C/EBP\u03b2 by BCR-ABL, CML stem cells will not be exhausted spontaneously in patients with CP-CMP. Therefore, we hypothesized that quiescent CML stem cells maintain their immature status in the bone marrow niche by suppressing C/EBP\u03b2 expression or function induced by BCR-ABL and that induction of C/EBP\u03b2 expression in CML stem cells through BCR-ABL-independent pathways may be a novel therapeutic strategy targeting CML stem cells. The aim of this study is to propose a novel therapeutic strategy that can stimulate quiescent CML stem cells with cytokine-STATs signalings and induce their exhaustion through C/EBP\u03b2-mediated differentiation. STATs are family members of molecules which convey signals from various kinds of cytokine receptors to nucleus. In order to investigate whether STAT molecules can induce C/EBP\u03b2 expression, we first examined the effects of constitutive active (CA) form of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 on C/EBP\u03b2 expression in a murine hematopoietic stem cell line, EML cells. Retroviral transduction of CA-STAT5 significantly upregulated C/EBP\u03b2 mRNA and protein in EML cells. EML cells begun to differentiate toward CD11b+ myeloid lineage upon introduction of CA-STAT5. CA-STAT1 and CA-STAT3 also upregulated C/EBP\u03b2 mRNA when they were retrovirally transduced into EML cells ( Figure 1 ). These results suggest that signaling mediated by various kinds of STATs can upregulate C/EBP\u03b2. Consensus binding sites for STATs were not found in the proximal (\u223c 4 kb) promoter region of C/EBP\u03b2 and we are currently identifying the cis-regulatory elements responsible for the STATs-dependent activation of C/EBP\u03b2.

Therefore we investigated the possible involvement of C/EBP\u03b2 in efficacy of IFN\u03b1 in CML treatments. Stimulation of EML cells with 500 U/ml IFN\u03b1 upregulated C/EBP\u03b2 mRNA ( Figure 2 ). Higher levels of phosphorylation of STAT1 than those of STAT3 or STAT5 were observed after stimulation with IFN\u03b1, suggesting that STAT1 mediated activation of C/EBP\u03b2 was induced by IFN\u03b1. As previously reported, C/EBP\u03b2 was upregulated in EML cells transduced with BCR-ABL (EML BCR-ABL ). Treatment of EML BCR-ABL cells with IFN\u03b1 augmented this effect significantly. IM effectively inhibited phosphorylation of STAT5 and blunted the upregulation of C/EBP\u03b2 in EML BCR-ABL cells. Simultaneous treatment of EML BCR-ABL cells with IFN\u03b1 and IM resulted in maintained upregulation of C/EBP\u03b2 with increased phosphorylation of STAT1 and decreased phosphorylation of STAT5. These data suggested that IFN\u03b1 treatment can upregulate C/EBP\u03b2 independently of signals mediated by BCR-ABL.

Stimulations of dormant CML stem cells with cytokines might be a novel treatment strategy to eliminate these populations, leading to complete cure of CML. We are currently evaluating the in vivo effects of IFN\u03b1 treatment on CML stem cells in mice models. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
