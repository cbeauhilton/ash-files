    "abstract_text": "Autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cryopreserved from a leukapheresis collection comprise the starting cellular source for the Wave \u00ae Bioreactor-based Xcellerate III Process [ Hami et al, Bioprocessing Journal  2003 : 2 ; 23 \u201332 ] used for the GMP manufacture of Xcellerated T Cells. For an ongoing clinical trial, n=13 patients have been infused with products manufactured from PBMC cryopreserved and stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen (LN 2 ) for 2\u20139 days before use in the Xcellerate III Process. This clinical protocol was recently amended to allow patients to receive a 2 nd infusion of Xcellerated T Cells. To date, 2 nd products have been manufactured for 11 of the CLL patients using the original PBMC that had been stored cryopreserved for up to 7 months from collection. Comparison of the processes for the manufacture of 1 st (n=13) and 2 nd (n=11) infusion products shows: \u2022 No significant difference in the in-process T cell activation as determined by increase in cell size, up-regulation of CD25 & up-regulation of CD154 expression (refer to Figure 1). View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure  \u2022 The total cell yield for 2 nd infusion products is within one (1) standard deviation of the average for the manufacture of the 1 st infusion product (refer to Table 1). \u2022 No significant difference in cell viability, CD3 + purity, or CD4:CD8 ratio for the final Xcellerated T Cells product (refer to Table 1).

In addition, these data demonstrate that cryopreserved PBMC can be stored for many months prior to their use as the starting material in the Xcellerate III Process.
