    "abstract_text": "T-helper 17 (Th17) cells constitute a subset of T cells that characteristically secrete IL-17. In addition to their normal adaptive immune functions, Th17 cells also play roles in supporting dysfunctional immune responses found in autoimmunity and cancer. Several studies suggest that Th17 cells play a protective role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). For example, CLL patients exhibit varied levels of circulating Th17 cells, and elevated levels positively correlate with better clinical outcome regardless of IGHV -mutation status. To understand this relationship and elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of Th17 generation in CLL, in particular the role of microRNAs known to affect Th17 development, we investigated cross-talk between na\u00efve CD4 + T cells and CLL B cells. Moreover, since intraclonal leukemic B-cell subpopulations differing in time since cell birth/division can exhibit different functional effects on antigen presentation, we explored the effect of B-cell activation on this T - leukemic B-cell dialogue and how it affects the generation of Th17 cells. To determine potential candidates differentially expressed in CLL, we conducted genome-wide single-cell expression analysis comparing fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified mature Th17 cells (CD3 + /CD4 + /CD45 + /CD161 + /CCR6 + / CCR4 + /CXCR3 - ) from CLL patients and healthy donors. Selected candidate genes met the criteria of >7-fold increase in expression in CLL, adjusted p-value <1.5 x 10 -6 , and link to lymphocyte biology. Among selected candidates, microRNA-155 (miR-155), a critical regulator of Th17 differentiation, was found. Follow-up real time, quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses indicated a significant increase (P < 0.01) in miR-155 expression in CLL Th17 cells as compared to Th17 cells from healthy controls. Since there was no difference in expression between na\u00efve T cells (CD3 + /CD4 + /CD62L + /CD45RO - ) cells, this suggested a CLL-unique mechanism of miR-155 modulation. To determine whether CLL cells directly influence miR-155 levels in na\u00efve CD4 + T cells, co-culture experiments using autologous leukemic or healthy B cells were carried out. FACS-purified peripheral blood na\u00efve CD4 + T cells and B cells from CLL patients and from age-matched healthy controls were co-cultured for 3 days, and expression of T-cell miR-155 was determined by RT-qPCR. In the presence of unstimulated CLL or healthy B cells, miR-155 expression in na\u00efve T cells remained unchanged across all co-cultures. However, upon activation, healthy and leukemic B cells exerted differential effects on miR-155 expression in autologous na\u00efve T cells. In the presence of autologous healthy B cells pre-activated with CpG-ODN2006 and IL-15, miR-155 expression in healthy na\u00efve T cells was significantly increased (P = 0.0313) across all samples. Conversely, CLL na\u00efve T cells co-cultured with autologous, pre-activated leukemic B cells showed heterogeneous modulation of miR-155. Of interest, the magnitude and direction of miR-155 changes in the autologous CLL co-cultures positively correlated not only with circulating Th17 levels (P = 0.019), as determined by flow cytometry, but also with patient time to first treatment (P = 0.0003). Moreover, when samples were divided into 2 groups based on an increase or decrease in miR-155 levels after exposure to activated compared to resting CLL B cells, a significant difference was seen with median survival of 237 months and 67 months, respectively (P = 0.005). Consistent with previous observations from our lab, this correlation was independent of various prognostic markers, including IGHV -mutation status. Our results suggest the existence of a miR-155 modulatory mechanism mediated by CLL B cells that differs based on leukemic B-cell activation state and the degree of change occurring when na\u00efve T cells are exposed to resting vs. activated B cells. Moreover, this variable effect in CLL patients differs from that in normal individuals, and the effect influences number of Th17 cells and patient outcome. Studies are underway to determine the effects that leukemic B cells, unstimulated or CpG-ODN2006 + IL-15 stimulated, have on autologous na\u00efve T-cell maturation into Th17 cells, and the extent that this process depends on the variable miR-155 modulatory capacity of leukemic B cells.
