    "abstract_text": "Context: TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms are involved in the toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of thiopurine drugs (6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)). The frequencies of polymorphisms of these genes are different across diverse populations. The role of TPMT and NUDT15 genes in adult patients (pts) with Ph-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Russia is still unclear. Objective: Evaluation of frequency and significance of TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms in the cohort of adult Ph-negative ALL pts treated by the RALL-2016 protocol. Design and Patients: Since April 2017 till July 2020 56 adult Ph-negative ALL patients treated by RALL-2016 protocol were included in the research of TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms. Median age was 32 \u0443 (range, 18-54), m/f: 39 (70%) / 17 (30%). B-ALL/LBL were diagnosed in 26 (46,4%) pts, T-ALL- in 26 (46,4%) and MPAL- in 4 (7,2%). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of given pts. Genetic polymorphisms in NUDT15 (*2, *3) and TPMT (*2, *3A, *3B, *3C) genes were detected using the allele-specific RT-PCR. The dose of 6-MP was calculated only for 54 pts from 56 (one of these pts stopped the therapy and another received the 1 st phase of induction by RALL-2016 without 6-MP). According to the RALL-2016 protocol 6-MP dose correction imply: if the level leukocytes<2,0*10 9 /l, thrombocytes <100*10 9 /l pts got 50% from the required dose. The therapy of 6-MP was stopped, if the level leukocytes <1,0*10 9 /l, thrombocytes <50*10 9 /l. On the 2 induction therapy by the protocol, the doses of 6-MP were calculated only for 47 pts with CR. The group of pts who didn't have remission on the 36 day by the protocol took the drug without corrections. Results: From 54 pts CR rate was 87 % (n=47) and resistance - 13% (n=7). One patient died in CR. The frequency of TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms in study group was 17,8 % (n=10): 6 (23%) of 26 pts with B-ALL, 3 (11,5 %) of 26 pts -T-ALL and 1 (25%) of 4 pts - MPAL. In our cohort these polymorphisms were found significantly more frequently in pts with B-ALL (p<0.001). These polymorphisms were detected in 8 (80%) men and 2 (20%) women (p=0.432). All detected polymorphisms were presented as heterozygous variants: NUDT15 * 3 was in 2 (20%) pts, TPMT*2 -1(10%), TPMT*3A -6 (60%), TPMT*3C -1 (10%). The doses of 6-MP in 5 pts with TPMT and NUDT15 and 42 pts with WT were 54% (27-89%) vs 71% (25-100%), respectively. Statistics analysis didn't show correlation between the 6-MP toxicity (difference of the fact dose of 6-MP therapy) and the polymorphisms in our cohort (fig.1). The frequency of resistance cases didn't different in cohort with/without TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms in 3 (37, 5%) from 8 pts and 4 (10, 5%) from 42 pts, respectively. Only 1 patient with heterozygous TPMT*2 died in CR due to toxicity and infection. Two-years overall survival (OS) in pts with the genetic polymorphisms was worse 75 % than in pts without them - 83,6% (p=0,67) (fig.2). Conclusions: In our study the frequency of TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms in adult pts with Ph-negative ALL was 17,8%. The statistical analysis showed that polymorphisms of these genes were detected more frequently in pts with \u0412-ALL. Only one patient with TPMT*2 had significant toxicity on the therapy of 6-MP and died in CR. However, we don't know whether this is due to deficient 6-MP metabolism. We didn't find a correlation between the 6-MP toxicity and the polymorphisms in our pts. There is a tendency that OS within 2-years in pts without TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms is better than in the group of pts with them. But our cohorts are small and require further study.
