    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is often accompanied with the aberrant expression of transcription factors. In t(8;21) AML, the AML1-ETO fusion protein executes its critical role in leukemogenesis through the interference with hematopoietic transcription factors (TFs) including AML1, C/EBP\u03b1, PU.1 and c-Myb. These transcription factors cooperate to modulate hematopoiesis by regulating their differentiation-related target genes. In our previous work, we have identified that AML1-ETO suppresses the AML1-dependent transactivation of the gene encoding the neutrophil granule protease, cathepsin G (CTSG). However, the detailed mechanisms of AML1-ETO mediated transrepression, especially coordinated regulation of hematopoietic transcription factors, have not been characterized yet. To investigate the regulatory pattern of CTSG by hematopoietic specific transcription factors, we constructed a luciferase reporter containing the CTSG promoter and co-transfect it with AML1, c-Myb, C/EBP\u03b1 or PU.1 to 293T cells. The results of luciferase assays showed that these TFs individually activated the CTSG promoter, and synergistic transactivation occurred between AML1 and c-Myb, C/EBP\u03b1 and PU.1, and PU.1 and c-Myb on the CTSG promoter. Furthermore, AML1/ETO effectively suppressed the transcription factor-dependent transactivation and synergistic transactivation of the CTSG promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrated that AML1-ETO coexisted with these TFs on the CTSG promoter in AML1/ETO-positive Kasumi-1 cell line, indicating AML1-ETO was tethered to the chromatin bound by these TFs. The data suggested that AML1-ETO might act as a negative regulator by interfering the normal function of hematopoietic TFs instead of competing for their binding. In addition, to reveal the underlying mechanism of AML1/ETO-mediated transcription repression at the epigenetic level, we examined the epigenetic status of the CTSG promoter in AML1-ETO negative and positive cells, and found the level of histone H3 Lys9 acetylation on the CTSG promoter was obviously lower in AML1-ETO positive cells than that in AML1-ETO negative cells. The data suggested that AML1-ETO might repress the gene transcription by changing the H3 acetylation status of its target gene. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that AML1-ETO represses the transactivation of the CTSG promoter mediated by multiple hematopoietic transcription factors through a decrease of H3 acetylation.
