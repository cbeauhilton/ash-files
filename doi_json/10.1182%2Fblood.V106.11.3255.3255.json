    "abstract_text": "Background: Loss of p53 is detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in interphase nuclei in 8\u201310% of patients with B-CLL and has been associated with aggressive disease and poor response to therapy. Results of chromosome studies suggest loss of p53 is often due to structural anomalies of chromosome 17 rather than monosomy 17. To characterize chromosome 17 anomalies in B-CLL, we used interphase and metaphase FISH to study a series of patients with this disorder. Methods: We studied 16 patients with B-CLL who had chromosome 17 anomalies detected by conventional chromosome studies or interphase FISH. The study cohort consisted of 8 females and 8 males (age 54 \u2013 73 years). Clinical data was available for 15 patients: Rai stages were I, II, III and IV for 1, 2, 6 and 6 patients, respectively; 14 patients received treatment and 10 have died. Metaphase and interphase FISH studies were performed using left-over fixed bone marrow or peripheral blood cell pellets from conventional cytogenetic studies. To identify recurrent chromosome 17 breakpoint cluster regions, patients were first studied with p53(17p13.1) and D17Z1(centromere17), and then with FISH probes for SMS(17p11.2) and RARA(17q21). For patients retaining the SMS probe site, we did FISH for HNPP(17p11.2\u201312) and D17Z1(centromere17). A total of 200 interphase nuclei and up to 20 metaphases were analyzed by each probe set. Results: The karyotype was normal for 3 patients and complex involving various abnormalities of chromosome 17 for the remaining 13. All patients showed loss of one p53 probe site with retention of both chromosome 17 centromeres. The SMS locus was absent in 13 patients indicating a breakpoint cluster region between the centromere and SMS probe site. In the remaining 3 patients, HNPP was absent, but the SMS probe site was retained indicating chromosome breakage between the SMS and HNPP probe sites. Metaphase FISH results indicate loss of p53 was due to an isochromosome 17p11.2 in 4 patients and an unbalanced translocation involving 17p11.2 in 12 patients. Conclusions: This study shows that loss of p53 in B-CLL cells is due to isochromosome formation or unbalanced translocations that involve a ~6,400 kb breakpoint cluster region adjacent to the centromere on the short arm of chromosome 17. Importantly, our findings indicate that loss of p53 is not due to loss of chromosome 17, simple deletions of p53, or chromosome breakage near the p53 locus. The region between the centromere and HNPP on chromosome 17 is known to be rich in low copy repeats and homologous DNA sequences are dispersed throughout the genome. In somatic cells, these repeats can result in pairing of the same or different chromosomes; crossing over within these homologous regions can result in translocations or isochromosomes. Undoubtedly, this genetic mechanism plays an important role in the origin of structural anomalies of chromosome 17 in B-CLL.",
