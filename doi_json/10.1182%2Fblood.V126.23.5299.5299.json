    "abstract_text": "Background: Lenalidomide (Len) is clinically active in CLL patients (pts). Robust anti-leukemic immune response from Len is truncated by dysfunctional immune system in CLL and anti-apoptotic bcl-2 protein. We hypothesized that therapeutic downregulation of Bcl-2 may help enhance the killing potential of immune effector cells that are activated by Len. AT-101 is a novel, orally active BH3-mimetic that binds to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL) and induces CLL cell death ex vivo (Masood et al British Journal of Haematology 2012). Encouraging efficacy and safety results of AT-101 alone or in combination with rituximab in CLL have been reported in Phase I/II studies. We have previously demonstrated that bcl-2 downregulation in CLL cells enhanced the killing potential of Len-activated immune cells. Conversely, pretreatment of CLL cells with Len enhanced AT-101 cytotoxicity in an immune cell independent manner (Masood et al British Journal of Haematology 2012). These preclinical findings formed the basis of a phase I/II clinical trial testing the combination of AT-101 and lenalidomide in relapsed B-CLL patients. Methods: The phase I portion of this study (NCT 01003769) utilizes a standard cohort of three design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination regimen. The MTD is defined as the dose level below the lowest dose that induces dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in at least one-third of patients. Following the MTD determination, the phase 2 portion will assess the efficacy of this combination using a one-stage design with an interim analysis. Key inclusion criteria include adult CLL pts with relapsed disease who have received 1-4 prior lines of treatment (Rx) (phase I) or 1-2 lines of Rx (phase II), last dose > 4 weeks from enrollment, ECOG performance status 0-2, good renal/liver function, acceptable blood counts. Patients with known hypersensitivity to thalidomide/Len or prior use of gossypol/AT-101 were excluded. Cycle 1 Rx includes Len alone and cycles 2-12 includes Len and AT-101. Starting doses of Len and AT-101 are 5mg oral daily on days 1-21 and 40 mg oral twice daily (b.i.d) on days 1-3 of a 28-day cycle. Planned dose escalation is shown in Table 1. Three pts will be treated at each dose level and observed during the first cycle of the combination Rx. Dose limiting toxicity is defined as grade 4 anemia unrelated to disease, thrombocytopenia-grade 4 or grade 3 with bleeding/requiring platelets, ANC 14 days, febrile neutropenia , Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity. Dose from Phase II will be based on MTD from phase I. Peripheral blood and bone marrow will be collected and analyzed for immune cellular microenvironment and effect of Len and AT-101 on molecular targets. Optional lymph node biopsy will be done at baseline and if tumor-flare reaction occurs. This study is expected to accrue a maximum of 26 pts in phase I and 34 pts in phase II, overall maximum sample size of 60 pts. Five pts in phase I have been accrued to date.
