    "abstract_text": "B7-H1 (CD274) is a costimulatory/coinhibitory molecule that plays a crucial role in T cell regulation in various immune responses. B7-H1 expression is detected not only on professional antigen-presenting cells but also on some tumor cells. It has been reported that B7-H1 molecules on tumor cells are associated with poor prognosis in patients with some tumors such as renal cancer and breast cancer. We reported previously that B7-H1 expression on blasts is rare in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Clin Cancer Res, 2003). In this study, we investigated whether functional B7-H1 molecules are expressed on blasts from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Using flow cytometry (FCM), we analyzed B7-H1 expression in MDS cell lines (OIH-1, SKM-1, and F36P) and on blasts in bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood samples. These samples were obtained from 40 MDS patients and 19 patients with AML transformed from MDS (AL-MDS). Among the cell lines, F36P cells showed a high level of B7-H1 expression. In patient samples, the percentage of B7-H1 + blasts tended to be the highest in patients with AL-MDS, followed by refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) in transformation (RAEB-t) and RA/RAEB (P<0.1). B7-H1 + cases, defined as samples in which more than 5% of blasts expressed B7-H1 (5% was the highest value of B7-H1 expression in normal CD34 + cells in our study), were observed in 0/13, 5/15 (33.3%), and 6/12 (50%) patients in the RA, RAEB, and RAEB-t categories, respectively. B7-H1 expression in MDS cell lines and on MDS patient blasts was induced or enhanced by cultivating cells with interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) or tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), which may be involved in the pathogenesis of MDS. The positive effect of the cytokines on B7-H1 expression was also observed in normal CD34 + cells. The combination of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 synergistically enhanced B7-H1 expression not only in MDS cell lines and on MDS patient blasts but also in normal CD34 + cells. Next, to investigate the features of B7-H1 + MDS blasts, cell cycle was determined using FCM. The percentages of cells in G0/G1 phase were lower and those in G2/M phase were higher in B7-H1 + F36P cells compared with B7-H1 \u2212 F36P cells. The data were essentially the same for B7-H1+ and B7-H1 \u2212 SKM-1 cells. To investigate the immunomodulatory effect of B7-H1 + blasts on T cells, we examined the proliferation and apoptosis of T cells cultured with irradiated B7-H1 + F36P cells. The addition of blocking antibodies to B7-H1 and its receptor PD-1 in this coculture increased the proliferation and decreased the apoptosis of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, suggesting that B7-H1 on MDS blasts induces T-cell apoptosis. Taking the results together, in MDS: B7-H1 expression on blasts occurs more often in the advanced than in the early stage; B7-H1 expression on blasts may be induced by cytokines derived from the BM environment; B7-H1 + blasts cycle more actively than B7-H1 \u2212 blasts; and B7-H1 molecules on blasts suppress T cells. These findings indicate that B7-H1 molecules on blasts may contribute to disease progression in MDS."
