    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for about one third of all leukemias, with half of all leukemia deaths. The low 5-year survival rate and manifestation of this deadly disease in old age reinforce the need for new safe and effective AML therapies. Considering the exceptional role of immune cells in the recognition and elimination of tumor cells, one of these methods is immunotherapy. However, for the development of immunotherapeutic approaches, it is necessary to clearly understand the role of certain effector cells in the pathogenesis of the disease, as well as to have the knowledge about the phenotypic characteristics of these cells. Natural killer (NK) cells play important roles in innate cancer immunosurveillance, and some published data indicate that the antitumor function of NK cells is reduced in AML patients. To expand upon previous work, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the phenotypic and functional characteristics of NK cells in previously untreated AML patients that took into account a wide variety of biomarkers. The goals of this study were to define the phenotypic and functional differences in NK cells from AML patients and healthy donors and determine how these parameters affect outcome of the disease. We used 14-color flow cytometry to assess more than 30 measurable markers on NK cells from the peripheral blood of 33 untreated AML patients and age-matched healthy controls. In addition, NK cells were tested for interferon-\u03b3 responses under antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity conditions. Results in AML patients were then compared to healthy donors. We found that the NK cells of patients with AML have a significantly lower capacity to secrete IFN-\u03b3 and showed numerous signs of an exhausted phenotype, as compared to healthy controls. These included increased surface expression of CD39, PD-1, and LILRB1 on NK cells from AML patients. Interestingly, surface expression of the TIGIT checkpoint receptor did not differ between AML patients and healthy donors, but surface expression of the activating receptor DNAM-1, which shares the same ligands on tumor cells, was decreased. All of these data confirm that the NK cells of AML patients are functionally impaired. We also noted that the frequency of CD57 + NKG2C + KIR + memory-like \"adaptive\" NK cells was greater in the blood of AML patients. The proportion of adaptive NK cells did not correlate with the age of donors. Phenotypic features of this cell subpopulation from the AML patients included significantly increased expression levels of CD56 and significantly lower expression of the activating receptor DNAM-1.
