    "abstract_text": "The peripheral blood white cell compartment is well characterised in adults but relatively little is known in neonates. T cell function has been reported to be very different between neonates and adults. This is significant because the newborn faces the most precipitous encounter with environmental challenges. To further understand the neonatal T cell compartment, we have focussed on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells which are known to make essential contributions to the immunoprotection of very young mice. We compared \u03b3\u03b4 cells and \u03b1\u03b2 T cells from human cord and neonatal blood from term and preterm babies, and compared them with adults. We investigated T cell cultures ex vivo and derived clones. Several findings were evident. First, we confirmed that fresh neonatal \u03b1\u03b2 cells and clones are profoundly deficient in IFN\u03b3 production. Second, we showed that this is not so pronounced for \u03b3\u03b4 cells and we note that IFN\u03b3 production was higher in preterm babies than in term neonates, perhaps reflective of stress in utero . Neonatal \u03b3\u03b4 clones also made adult quantities of GM-CSF and TRAIL. We note thirdly that neonatal \u03b3\u03b4 clones make IL-4 and IL-5 (Th2 cytokines) and the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10, which is not produced at all by adult V\u03b39 + clones. Fourth, these pleiotropic activities of human neonatal \u03b3\u03b4 clones appears to be determined by the type of T cell receptor expressed. V\u03b41-expressing clones have broad functional potentials whereas V\u03b39-expressing clones polarise to either a Th1 or Th2 like profile. Fifth, particularly high Th1 cytokine production is observed in V\u03b39-V\u03b41 (DP) cells which are more common and therefore more easily cloned from neonatal versus adult blood. We conclude that the neonatal \u03b3\u03b4 cells are highly active and broader in their cytokine production than either their adult \u03b3\u03b4 cell or their neonatal \u03b1\u03b2 T cell counterparts. Thus, \u03b3\u03b4 cells should be better understood vis-a\u0300-vis perinatal vaccination regimens and the development of childhood allergies.",
