    "abstract_text": "Background: Health-Related Quality of life (HRQoL) is diminished in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We have previously shown that HRQoL remains stable over time and low hemoglobin, transfusion dependence (TD) and age > 65 years impact QoL1. Here, we present an updated larger data set with longer follow up and consider the impact of baseline characteristics and treatments received on patient-related outcomes. Methods: MDS-CAN is a prospective database active in 15 centers across Canada, enrolling patients since April 2012. In addition to disease and patient-related characteristics, we measure HRQoL at baseline and every 6 months using the EORTC-QLQ-C30, EQ-5D, and a global fatigue scale (GFS). We examined the impact of disease related factors (IPSS, IPSS-R, karyotype, TD), patient factors (ECOG, age, gender, co-morbidity (Charlson index), frailty (Rockwood scale), disability (Lawton-Brody Independent Activities of Daily Living), and treatments received at any time (azacitidine (AZA), lenalidomide, erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESA), iron chelation) on QoL scores. AZA-treated patients were divided into responders (where documented) or deriving benefit (if > 6 cycles) vs. non-responders. Wilcoxon rank-sum or Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric tests were used to compare scores among subgroups. Changes in QoL were assessed with a linear mixed model to account for time- dependent covariates such as TD, risk scores and treatment. Results: 594 patients were enrolled a median of 2.2 months post diagnosis (IQR: 0.8, 4.8) with a median age of 73 years , 63% male gender and performance status (ECOG) of 0-1 in 90%. IPSS scores were low/int-1 in 73% and IPSS-R scores were very low (9%), low (30%), intermediate (27%), high (20%) and very high (14% of patients). 31% were transfusion dependent at enrolment. Treatments received at any time included AZA (38%), lenalidomide (9.8%), ESA (35%) and iron chelation (12%). At a median follow up of 17 months, 329 patients (55%) died with cause of death reported as AML in 22%. Baseline assessment: Mean EQ-5D global score for the cohort was 0.75 \u00b1 0.25 and did not significantly change over time (Figure 1). Patients with high IPSS, high/very high IPSS-R, TD, lower hemoglobin, higher ECOG, increased comorbidity, frailty and disability were more likely to have lower EQ-5D/QLQ C30 scores (inferior QoL) and higher fatigue (GFS). Age was not significantly related to QoL. Interestingly, female gender was associated with inferior QoL by EQ-5D and GFS (Figure 2). Patients scoring in the lowest quartiles for physical performance tests (grip, 4 metre walk and 10x chair sit-stand tests) also had inferior QoL scores. QoL over time: By linear mixed modelling, we did not find significant differences in QoL over time in patients treated with or without AZA, lenalidomide, or ESAs measured by the EQ-5D instrument. Iron chelation was associated with lower scores ( p =0.003) although this may simply be a surrogate for transfusion dependence which is associated with inferior QoL. AZA responding/deriving benefit patients had higher QoL scores from baseline and decreased fatigue compared with those not responding or not deriving benefit (Figure 3) measured by the QLQ-C30 and GFS instruments. Patients with the highest IPSS/IPSS-R risk groups had significantly inferior QoL over time. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that HRQoL remains fairly stable over time in MDS and implementation of treatment is not at the detriment of patient related outcomes. Patients treated with AZA who respond or remain on drug for > 6 months maintain higher QoL scores over time. Disease (IPSS, IPSS-R, hemoglobin, transfusion dependence) and patient-related factors (ECOG, gender, comorbidities, disability, frailty) are associated with reduced HRQoL. The prospective assessment of QoL using a validated MDS-specific QoL instrument (QUALMS) and disease course is underway. 1 Buckstein, R., Alibhai, S.M., Lam, A., et al.
