    "abstract_text": "Active immunization of follicular lymphoma patients with idiotypic vaccines elicits antigen-specific antibody responses, T-cell responses, and antitumor effects ( Bendandi, M. et al., Nat Med  5 , 1171 ). We hypothesized that these vaccinated patients could generate tumor specific immune responses, not only against idiotype, but also against other tumor associated antigens (TAA) by a mechanism of epitope spreading. We further hypothesize that these antigens may represent tumor rejection targets for immunotherapy. To identify potential antigens, a phage surface expressed cDNA library derived from primary tumor cells was screened with sera from idiotype-vaccinated patients. Consistent with our hypothesis, we identified two immunogenic peptides (FL-aa-7 and 18), unrelated to idiotype, which were recognized by postvaccine sera but not by prevaccine or normal human sera. These peptide sequences derived from the 5\u2032-untranslated regions of the human GTPase, IMAP family member 7 gene (FL-aa-7) and an alternative reading frame of U1-snRNP 70 (FL-aa-18), respectively, suggesting that epitope spreading had occurred. To further determine the specificity of these patients\u2019 post vaccine sera, the corresponding FL-aa-7 and FL-aa-18 peptides were synthesized and tested for serum binding. As expected, post-vaccine but not pre-vaccine or normal, specifically bound the FL-aa-7 and FL-aa-18 peptides, respectively. Furthermore, both peptides specifically inhibited the binding of post-vaccine sera to the respective FL-aa-7 and FL-aa-18 phage clones in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that Id vaccinated patients generated specific antibodies to novel peptides FL-aa-7 and FL-aa-18, unrelated to Id. Overall, these data indicate that Id-vaccinated B cell lymphoma patients mounted antibody responses specifically for FL-aa-7-1 and FL-aa-18 peptides, which may represent a potential immunotherapeutic tumor antigen. The clinical and biological relevance of the response is to be elucidated.",
