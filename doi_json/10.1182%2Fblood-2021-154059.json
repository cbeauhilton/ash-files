    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Mutated Nucleophosmin 1 ( NPM1 mut ) is the most common genetic alteration in AML, seen in 30-35% of newly diagnosed cases. NPM1 mut is associated with a favorable prognosis in newly diagnosed AML. However, the prognostic impact of NPM1 mut in R/R AML has not been defined. We conducted an analysis to characterize the impact of NPM1 mut on outcomes of patients (pts) with R/R AML and the impact of specific therapies in R/R NPM1 mut AML. Methods: We identified 1722 pts with R/R AML treated at our institution between Sept 2012 and Dec 2020 and classified them based on their NPM1 mutational status. Pts were treated with either intensive chemotherapy (IC) including combinations of cytarabine (>2gm/m 2 /d) and idarubicin with or without a nucleoside analog, or low intensity chemotherapy (LIC) which included either hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine, with or without the addition of venetoclax or targeted therapies. Responses were defined according to the ELN 2017 criteria. Mutational analysis was performed using validated institutional next-generation sequencing panels including panels of genes frequently involved in AML. Results: Among 1722 pts with R/R AML, 204 (12%) had NPM1 mut (Table1), with 58% being women ( P < 0.0001). In R/R AML, compared to pts with NPM1 wt , those with NPM1 mut had higher white blood cell count on presentation ( P < 0.0001) and were less likely to have secondary or therapy-related AML ( P < 0.05). Akin to the newly diagnosed setting, pts with NPM1 mut R/R AML frequently harbored a diploid karyotype (61%, P < 0.0001) and FLT3- ITD mutations (49%, P < 0.0001) of which 40% had an allele ratio >0.5. As expected, the probability of achieving a response decreased with each sequential line of salvage therapy in patients with R/R NPM1 mut AML. Following the 1 st , 2 nd , or \u22653 rd line of salvage therapy, rates of complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) (CR/CRi) were 64%, 54% and 39%, (P>0.05), respectively. However, overall pts with R/R NPM1 mut AML had higher CR/CRi rates compared to those with NPM1 wt within each line of salvage therapy ( CR/CRi rate: 1 st salvage: 64% vs 44%, P =0.0001; \u22652 nd salvage: 39%% vs 26%, P =0.02). In the entire cohort, R/R NPM1 mut pts treated with LIC with venetoclax, IC without venetoclax, and LIC without venetoclax demonstrated a CR/CRi of 85%, 75%, and 54% (vs CR/CRi rates 40%, 32% and 50%in NPM1 wt pts for the respective therapies, all P <0.05). This difference in CR/CRi rates between NPM1 mut and NPM1 wt was also noted when analyzing salvage 1 and salvage \u22652 patients separately(Table 2). Despite higher response rates associated with R/R NPM1 mut AML in each salvage setting, there was no difference in in the entire cohort for relapse-free survival (RFS: 5.4 vs 5.4m, 1-year RFS rate: 33% vs 28%, P=0.36) and overall survival (OS: 6.1 vs 5.5m, 1-yr OS rate: 29% vs 24%,P=0.06) between NPM1 mut and NPM1 wt . Among pts receiving 1 st salvage treatment, those with R/R NPM1 mut had a significantly improved OS compared with NPM1 wt (7.9m vs 5.9m; 1-yr OS 36% vs 28%, P =0.04) (Fig 1A) In contrast ,there was no difference in OS in pts with R/R NPM1 mut and NPM1 wt AML receiving 2 nd salvage (6.9m vs 5.3m, 1-yr OS 19% vs 19%, P =0.71) or \u22653 rd salvage (4.0m vs 4.3m; 1-yr OS 20% vs 17%, P =0.84 ) (Figure 1B and 1C) . The median RFS did not differ between pts with R/R NPM1 mut and NPM1 wt AML in 1 st salvage (7.5m vs 5.5m, 1-year RFS rate: 39% vs 31%, P =0.10), 2 nd salvage (2.1m vs 4.6m, 1-year RFS rate: 7% vs 19%, P =0.06), or \u22653 rd salvage (5.7m vs 5.3m, 1-year RFS rate: 25% vs 18%, P =0.85). Among pts with R/R NPM1 mut , there was no difference in CR/CRi rates (53% vs 59%, P=0.55) or OS (5.8m vs 7.7m; 1-yr OS 24% vs 37%, P =0.07) between those with FLT3 mut and FLT3 wt . Conclusion : Despite having higher response rates in the R/R setting, patients with NPM1 mut had similar survival outcomes compared with those with NPM1 wt AML, especially in salvage 2 and beyond. Therefore, unlike its impact in ND AML, NPM1 mutational status does not confer a favorable prognostic impact in pts with advanced R/R AML. This establishes contemporary baseline CR/CRi and OS expectations for NPM1 mut R/R AML in various salvage settings. Updated co-mutation data and impact of specific therapies on survival and co-mutational groups will be presented at the meeting.
