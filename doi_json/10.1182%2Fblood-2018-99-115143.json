    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN) patients encounter debilitating pain syndromes as a result of their disorder. Opioids are frequently employed in cancer-related pain but have been increasingly recognized for their risk profiles including accidental overdose, addiction and death. With many MPN patients facing near-normal life expectancies, chronicity of opioid use may increase the risk of adverse events. In this survey, we evaluated the prevalence of MPN opioid use, risk factors for negative outcomes and compared the features of this population to MPN patients not receiving opioid therapy. Methods: This study was performed by the MPN Quality of Life Study Group. A survey was designed by a team of MPN investigators experienced with MPN symptomatology. Patients completed the MPN-10, a 10 item survey of MPN symptoms completed on a 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable) scale (Blood. 2011 Jul 14;118(2):401-8). Other surveyed tools included the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) as well as DSMV criteria for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). The survey was posted on high-traffic MPN-related webpages focused on patient education and advocacy ( MPN Forum , MPN Net , MPN Research Foundation , MPN Voice) for a total of 28 days. Patients currently receiving opioids were compared to patients not receiving opioids and statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. Results Demographics A total of 416 patients completed the survey and were compared by active opioids use (n=69) vs. no active opioid use (n=347). Patients described a history of myelofibrosis (MF, 28.8%), polycythemia vera (PV, 44.2%) and essential thrombocythemia (ET, 26.9%). Most MPNs were diagnosed between 1-3 years ago (22.2%), 3-10 years ago (35.0%) or >10 years ago (30.4%). Patients were furthermore of expected mean age (60.7), primarily female (75.0%) and from the United States (66.6%). Few patients had a history of transformation to acute leukemia (0.5%), severe bleeding (12.3%) or blood clot (26.5%). Mean individual symptom scores and prevalences were 3.0 and 65.6% for abdominal discomfort and 3.3 and 59.4% for bone pain, respectively, indicating a low to moderate symptom burden. Patients Receiving Opioid Therapy Patients on opioid therapy (n=69) displayed a number of high risk features for adverse outcomes including a personal history of substance abuse (20.2%), respiratory disease (33%) and mental health disorders (60.1%). By DSMV criteria, 5.9% of opioid patients scored 'mild' and 2.9% scored 'moderate' for OUD (total 8.8%), consistent with prevalence in the general population. Approximately 24.6% of opioid-using patients scored moderate to high risk on the ORT but despite this, did not appear more likely to meet criteria for OUD (p=0.81). Palliative care and pain management were involved in only 34.3% of patients and side effects of opioids were discussed in only 70.1% of all cases. Opioid vs. Non-Opioid Patients Compared to patients not receiving opioid therapy, patients currently on opioid treatment were more likely to describe more frequent and/or more severe abdominal discomfort (88.4% vs. 61.0%, p<0.001; mean 5.0 vs. 2.6, p<0.001), bone pain (87.0% vs. 53.9%, p<0.001; mean 5.6 vs. 2.4, p<0.001), unintentional weight loss (41.2% vs. 21.4%, p=0.001), inactivity (94.2% vs. 71.5%, p<0.001), early satiety (84.1% vs. 58.2%, p<0.001), and impaired quality of life (mean 4.9 vs. 6.6, p<0.001). They were also more likely to describe regularly taking pain medications (85.5% vs. 34.5%, p<0.001) as well as attempt non-pharmacological treatments to manage symptoms (Figure 1). Despite more aggressive pain treatment approaches, only 42% of opioid patients reported satisfaction with their current pain plan vs. 62.2% of patients not receiving opioid therapy. Conclusions: MPN patients face significant symptom burden despite often limited reduction in life expectancy. Patients furthermore demonstrate a high prevalence of risk factors for opioid-related complications including overdose and substance misuse. Despite aggressive pain regimens, opioid patients are less likely to voice adequate symptom control or satisfaction with their pain treatment plans. Providers should be cognizant of opioid-related complications and consider subspecialty pain management referrals or adaptation of the JCO Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of Chronic Pain in Survivors of Adult Cancers (J Clin Oncol. 2016 Sep 20;34(27):3325-45).
