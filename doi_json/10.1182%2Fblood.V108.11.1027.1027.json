    "abstract_text": "About 30% of patients with severe hemophilia A develop neutralizing antibodies against FVIII (FVIII inhibitors) following replacement therapy. The type of FVIII gene mutation as well as other predisposing genetic factors contribute to the inhibitor phenotype. Based on these findings, we asked if the genetic background modulates the long-term persistence of anti-FVIII antibodies and anti-FVIII antibody secreting plasma cells in the E17 murine hemophilia model. Furthermore, we asked if the recently described inhibition of memory-B-cell re-stimulation by high doses of FVIII is influenced by the genetic background of the murine model. E17 mice on two different genetic backgrounds (C57Bl/6J and Balb/c) were treated with four doses of 200 ng human FVIII at weekly intervals. Anti-FVIII antibodies and anti-FVIII antibody secreting plasma cells were followed up to 12 months after the last dose of FVIII. Antibody titers and subclasses of antibodies (IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3) were measured by ELISA. Antibody secreting plasma cells in spleen and bone marrow were detected by ELISPOT as described (Hausl et al., Thromb Haemost 2002). The re-stimulation of FVIII-specific memory B cells was studied as described recently (Hausl et al., Blood 2005). Anti-FVIII antibodies and anti-FVIII antibody secreting plasma cells were first detectable in E17 Balb/c mice. IgM antibodies in the circulation and IgM secreting plasma cells in the spleen were observed after the first dose of FVIII, IgG antibodies and IgG secreting plasma cells after the second dose. No anti-FVIII antibodies after the first dose of FVIII were observed in E17 C57BL/6J mice but both IgM and IgG antibodies as well as IgM and IgG producing plasma cells were detectable after the second dose of FVIII. The antibody response involved all IgG subclasses in both mouse strains. However, IgG1 was dominant in E17 Balb/c mice whereas IgG2a was dominant in E17 C57BL/6J mice. When the in vitro restimulation of FVIII-specific memory B cells was examined, similar patterns were observed for both mouse strains. Low concentrations of FVIII between 10 and 100 ng/ml FVIII restimulated memory B cells and induced their differentiation into antibody secreting plasma cells whereas high concentrations of FVIII between 1,000 and 20,000 ng/ml FVIII inhibited memory-B-cell-restimulation. These results indicate that the dose-dependent effect of FVIII on the restimulation of FVIII-specific memory B cells does not depend on the genetic background. The major difference between both hemophilic mouse strains was the amplitude of the anti-FVIII immune response. Peak titers of anti-FVIII antibodies and peak concentrations of anti-FVIII antibody secreting plasma cells in spleen and bone marrow were significantly higher in E17 C57BL/6J mice than in E17 Balb/c mice. Whether or not higher ELISA titers correlate with higher Bethesda titers of neutralizing antibodies is currently being investigated. Despite the substantial differences in the amplitude of the immune response, anti-FVIII antibodies and anti-FVIII antibody secreting plasma cells persisted for the whole observation period of 12 months after the last dose of FVIII in both mouse strains. We conclude that the amplitude of the anti-FVIII immune response in hemophilic mice is significantly different between E17 C57BL/6J and E17 Balb/c mice. However, the persistence of the immune response is comparable.",
