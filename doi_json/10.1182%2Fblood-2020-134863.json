    "abstract_text": "We previously reported that by flow cytometry study of mononuclear cells (peripheral blood) of IGF-1 R (insulin growth factor -1 receptor) can help in differentiating polycythemia vera (PV) from secondary erythrocytosis (PLoS ONE 11(11): e016529), in patients negative for JAK2V617F mutation who requires frequent phlebotomy. EEC (Endogenous erythroid colony formation) formation which was shown to be related to IGF-1 signaling was employed as a minor criteria of PV prior to 2016 WHO criteria for the diagnosis of PV. IRS-2, an IGF-1 activation downstream signaling protein was found to be a docking protein, specific for erythropoietin-induced erythropoiesis. Current studies were designed to correlation between IGF-1R over-expression to EEC (Endogenous erythroid colony formation) formation and IRS-2 over expression in those patients who required frequent phlebotomy with elevated IGF-1R and JAK2 mutation negative patients. Materials and Methods: Patients: 8 patients withsecondary polycythemia (JAK2V617F mutation negative), and 12 MPN patients (6 ET, 3 PV and 3 MF) were studied. Of the 12 MPN patients, 11 were JAK2 mutation positive and 1 was CALR mutation positive. All 20 patients had elevated IGF-1 R. Methods: 1) IGF-1R expression: 10 6 cells blood mononuclear cells were incubated with 10 \u03bcL of PE\u2010conjugated control or anti\u2010IGF1R IgG (R&D Systems) for 30 minutes. Fluorescent intensity was detected by a flow cytometry. 2) EEC formation: Erythroid colony cultures using Methyl cellulose based medium without (MethoCult H4230) or with pre-inclusion of cytokines (MethoCult H4230, including erythropoitin) from StemCell Technologies Inc. were used. On day 10-12, colonies were scored for Burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-e), Colony forming unit-erythroid (CFU-e), and Colony forming unit cells (CFU-c) according to the manufacturer's graphic guide. 3) IRS-2 Expression: RT-PCR Predesigned primers for IRS-2 and internal control genes were ordered from Qiagen (Germantown, MD). Real-time PCR blood mononuclear cells was performed using SsoAdvanced\u2122 Universal SYBR \u00ae Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) on Bio-Rad iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System. At least three house-keeping genes (ribosomal protein L4, TATA box binding protein, and tubulin-\u03b1 1b) were used as normalization controls. The expression of IRS-2 was compared with each internal control and the final patient to normal control ratio was the average of the three. Results: 7 out of 8 patients with secondary PV, were found to have EEC formation. 12 MPN patients had increased expression of IRS-2 (Fig 1). 2 patients with secondary PV, so far studied also were found to have increased expression of IRS-2. Conclusion: 1) In patients with secondary PV (JAK2 mutation negative and increased IGF-1 and requiring frequent phlebotomy0, 7 out of 8 (87%) were found to have EEC formation. This suggests that IGF-1 by Flow cytometry can replace EEC as a supplement to the diagnosis of PV. 2) In JAK2 or CALR mutation positive patients , IGF-1R over-expression were found to have to have IRS-2 over-expression , 2 patients with secondary PV so far studied were also found to have elevated IRS-2 signaling. This suggests that the etiology of erythrocytosis in these secondary PV is likely through IRS-2 pathway. Further studies on this is still in progress.
