    "abstract_text": "Previous studies have identified broad cytogenetic risk groups in AML, by comparing outcome of pts with different recurring abnormalities, using cytogenetically normal pts as the reference group. Pts with better survival were considered as \u201cfavorable\u201d, and those with worse outcome as \u201cunfavorable\u201d risk. To identify prognostic cytogenetic groups for complete remission (CR) and overall survival (OS), without the selection of a reference group, we used classification trees and tree-structured survival analysis (TSSA). We analyzed the outcome of 600 AML pts \u226560 years (yrs), enrolled in the prospective CALGB cytogenetic study 8461 and treated on CALGB front-line AML protocols. Analysis was restricted to cytogenetic aberrations occuring in \u22655 pts. Once prognostic cytogenetic abnormalities for CR and OS were identified, multivariable models were constructed. Median age was 68 (range, 60\u201386) yrs, and 98% had de novo AML. The most common karyotypes were normal (46%), complex with \u22653 abnormalities (complex \u22653, 19%), and \u22655 abnormalities (complex \u22655, 14%). Core binding factor ( CBF ) abnormalities, ie, inv(16) and t(8;21), occurred in 5%. Overall, 49.5% of pts achieved CR with only 7% (95%CI: 5%\u20139%) alive at 5 yrs. Table 1 shows prognostic cytogenetic risk groups identified by classification trees and TSSA for CR and OS, respectively. Table 1: Prognostic Cytogenetic Groups by Tree Analysis  CR . OS .

Only lower % circulating blasts ( P =0.0002) and cytogenetic risk groups ( P <0.0001) predicted CR. Compared to CBF pts, the odds of CR were significantly lower for pts with complex \u22653 and abnormal, non-CBF karyotypes, whereas the odds of CR for cytogenetically normal pts was not significantly different from CBF pts. For OS, cytogenetic risk groups ( P <0.0001), older age ( P =0.03), and higher WBC at diagnosis ( P =0.02) predicted shorter survival. Compared to CBF pts, the risk of death was significantly higher for those with complex \u22655 karyotype, \u22127, and <5 abnormalities without CBF or \u22127. Table 2: Multivariable Analyses  CR .

Such pts may be better suited for investigational therapy or only supportive care.",
