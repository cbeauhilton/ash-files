    "abstract_text": "Background: HIT is an antibody-mediated adverse effect of heparin associated with a high frequency of thromboembolic complications (TEC). Objectives/Setting: To assess institutional progress in 6 quality improvement HIT outcome metrics. In 2001, a multi-disciplinary HIT Task Force was formed at the Charleston Area Medical Center, a tertiary-care medical center. Quality initiatives included a reduction of heparin exposures, development of standardized guidelines/order sets for diagnosis/treatment accessible via a HIT intranet website and the establishment of an IRB-approved HIT patient registry to be used for research and quality improvement ( Blood. 102 : 750a , 2003 ). Six outcome measures were selected by the HIT Task Force to evaluate progress in the quality initiatives (Table). Methods: Retrospective review of registry data of patients treated for clinical HIT at this institution 1999\u20132004. Yrs. 1999\u20132002 were considered baseline during the era of increasing HIT awareness/Task Force establishment, 2003\u20132004 were considered the initial reassessment period. Patients: 436 patients, mean age 67 yrs (26\u201392), female 215/436 (49%), admission type: cardiac surgery 294/436 (67%), non-cardiac surgery 38/436 (9%), non-surgical 104/436 (24%). Results: The frequency of new thrombotic/new ischemic events after HIT diagnosis, frequency of amputation and warfarin initiation upon adequate platelet recovery showed statistically significant improvement (Table). The frequency of presentation with thrombosis was trending toward a significant change. All cause mortality and frequency of patients receiving treatment with a direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) or heparinoid therapy within one day of \u201cHIT suspected\u201d improved, but not at a statistically significant level. Conclusions: The results of these analyses establish the value of a multi-disciplinary HIT Task Force in leading hospital-based improvements for strategically-defined outcomes relevant to HIT patient care. Specifically, these efforts resulted in a statistically significant 87% relative reduction in amputations, a 46% relative reduction in the development of a new TEC/new ischemic event after HIT diagnosis and a 10% relative increase in instituting warfarin therapy upon platelet count recovery. A statistically non-significant 21% relative reduction in all-cause mortality, an 18% relative reduction in HIT patients presenting with a TEC and a 4% relative increase in the frequency of instituting a DTI within 1 day of first suspecting HIT were also observed. These findings are being used by the HIT Task Force to guide their activities for 2005. Outcome Metrics  . 1999\u20132002 . 2003\u20132004 . P-value .
