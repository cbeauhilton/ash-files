    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4098 Introduction. The ability to achieve rapid and sustained myeloid and platelet engraftment is a major determinant for outcome in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The CXCR4 chemokine receptor , present in hematopoietic progenitors (HPs), and its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) play a pivotal role in retaining HPs within the bone marrow microenvironment in the adult. Recently, the intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2680880 in CXCR4 located close to a region implicated in alternative splicing that generates 2 variants, has been associated with peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) mobilization success among healthy donors (Haematologica 2011; 96: 102\u2013109). Aim. To evaluate the influence of rs2680880 polymorphism in CXCR4 on engraftment of PBPC in patients undergoing ASCT. Patients and Methods. A total of 144 ASCT patients were included (60 lymphoma, 60 multiple myeloma, 24 acute leukemia). The median dose of PBPC infused was 2.6 x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg. Myeloid and platelet recovery after transplant were evaluated by daily CBC. The rs2680880 polymorphism was genotyped by allelic discrimination polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays using TaqMan\u00aeGenotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems). Results. Allelic frequencies were 0.64 for A allele and 0.36 for T allele, being 13% of patient TT homozygous. Notably, when analyzing the subgroup of 136 patients that had been infused with a yield of CD34+ cells below the 95th percentile (<6.8\u00d710 6 /kg CD34+ cells) the presence of the T variant in homocygosis was related with a significant delayed myeloid and platelet engraftment compared to AA+AT genotypes. Thus, TT homozygotes exhibited slower leukocyte recovery, (neutrophils >0.5\u00d710 9 /L [15 vs. 12 days, p=0.022], neutrophils >1\u00d710 9 /L [16 vs. 13 days, p=0.023). Platelet engraftment was similarly delayed (>20 \u00d7 10 9 /L and >50 \u00d7 10 9 /L [18 vs. 13 days, p=0.038; 23 vs. 17 days, p=0.016, respectively]). The T allele in heterozygosity did not have any influence on these variables. A multivariate analysis considering age, disease, low platelet/leukocyte count before mobilization, rs2680880 polymorphism in CXCR4 and number of CD34+ cells infused, showed that the best predictive factors for delayed platelet recovery were the number of infused CD34+ cells and the presence of the T variant in homozygosis. Remarkably, homozygosis for T allele in CXCR4 was found to be the main and only predictive factor for neutrophil engraftment. Discussion. Some patients exhibit delayed recoveries after ASCT despite a sufficient number of CD34+ cells administered in a clinically stable situation. We find that a homozygous common variant (rs2680880[T]) that could modulate the alternative splicing in CXCR4 to produce shorter transcripts, is a strong predictor of engraftment. A high number of CD34+ infused cells probably disguise or lessen the effect of the TT allelic variant of CXCR4 gene on PBPC homing. Because the migration of hematopoietic stem cells is a complex process that involves the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis, we speculate that this genetic marker could be associated to poorer mobilization responses to plerixafor. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to describe a genetic variable as a potential predictive factor in the hematological recovery after ASCT. Funding.
