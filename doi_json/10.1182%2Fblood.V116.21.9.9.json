    "abstract_text": "Abstract 9 To identify novel oncogenic pathways in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we combined expression profiling of 117 pediatric patient samples and detailed molecular cytogenetic analyses. Using unsupervised and supervised analyses, we identified a T-ALL cluster that was associated with an immature immunophenotype (CD1 \u2212 , CD4 \u2212 , CD8 \u2212 ), frequent expression of CD34 and co-expression of the myeloid markers CD13/CD33. Patients in this cluster lacked any of the known oncogenic rearrangements, but ectopically expressed MEF2C , which was recently demonstrated as an important transcription factor for T-cell development 1 . Molecular-cytogenetic analyses including the Chromatine Conformation Capture on Chip (4C) method revealed novel rearrangements of the MEF2C locus at 5q14, rearrangement of transcription factors that target MEF2C ( PU.1 , NKX2-5, RUNX1 ) or MEF2C-associated cofactors ( NCOA2/GRIP1 ) in about half of the patients in this cluster. Four out of the 6 rearrangements identified have never been observed before in human cancer. Nearly all of these patients in this cluster could be predicted by the early T-cell precursor (ETP) signature 2 using PAM statistics. This indicates that MEF2C may represent the oncogene for ETP T-ALL, an entity that has been associated with poor outcome 2 . Inhibition of MEF2C in a cell line model system provoked relieve of developmental arrest, indicating that ectopic MEF2C expression blocks T-cell development at an early stage. We demonstrated that MEF2C is a transcriptional regulator for many differentially expressed genes that were associated with the immature cluster including LYL1 and LMO2 . Although LYL1 has been suggested as potential oncogene for immature T-ALL cases 3 , oncogenic rearrangements were never identified in T-ALL cases with immature immunophenotype. Our data therefore imply that high expression of LYL1 (and LMO2 ) is part of a pathogenic pathway for immature T-ALL that is regulated by the MEF2C oncogene. 1 Stehling-Sun, S., Dade, J., Nutt, S.
