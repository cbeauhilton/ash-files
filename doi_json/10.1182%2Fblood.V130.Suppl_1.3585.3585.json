    "abstract_text": "Introduction Interleukin-15 (IL-15) and IL-2 are important cytokines that drive the progression of many T-cell malignancies such as T-cell Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia (T-LGLL) and HTLV-1 derived Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL). T-LGLL is characterized by clonal expansion of cytotoxic T cells and is associated with a constitutively active JAK/STAT pathway controlled by cytokines including IL-15 and IL-2. A computational systems approach identified IL-15 as a master regulator of T-LGLL survival and patients have increased IL-15/IL-15Ra serum levels. Cytokine signaling leads to increased phosphorylation and activation of STAT proteins. T-LGLL cells exhibit STAT3 or STAT5 mutational activation in some cases and constitutive activation in all patients. T-LGLL treatments are not selective or curative, and the commonly utilized immunosuppressive agents are not effective in all patients. ATL is an aggressive T-cell disorder that also exhibits aberrant IL-2 and IL-15 cytokine signaling. Tax, identified as an essential oncogene in the disease, is associated with increased cytokine and cytokine receptor expression. ATL patients have high IL-2Ra gene expression and PBMCs from chronic/smoldering ATL patients can depend on autocrine production of cytokines for proliferation. Patients with ATL have poor prognosis and current cytokine-targeting therapies have not proven to be efficacious. The gc receptor is shared by the gc-family cytokines including IL-2, -4, -7, -9, -15 and -21. BNZ-1 (formerly known as BNZ132-1-40) is a pegylated peptide designed to specifically bind the gc receptor to block IL-2, IL-15 and, to a lesser extent, IL-9 cytokine signaling. Because these cytokines are vital to the survival of T cells in T-LGLL and ATL, these diseases represent ideal models to test the hypothesis that treatment of leukemic cells with BNZ-1 will result in reduced proliferation and viability. Methods These studies utilized a human T-LGL cell line (TL1), PBMCs from T-LGLL patients and ATL patients, and human IL-15 transgenic NSG mice injected with the ED40515(+) ATL cell line expressing luciferase. In vitro assays were performed after an overnight cytokine withdrawal and 20-minute pretreatment with BNZ-1 prior to addition of cytokine. Leukemic mice were divided into 3 treatment groups; BNZ-1 (40 mg/kg i.v. 2x per week for 4 weeks), JAK1/2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib (Ruxo) (50 mg/kg/day s.c. by pump for 28 days) and PBS control. Tumor burden was measured through bioluminescence imaging (Xenogen IVIS). Results Our results demonstrate that in vitro treatment of TL1 cells with BNZ-1 inhibits IL-2 and IL-15 mediated expansion and viability. BNZ-1 impaired the growth of these cytokine-dependent cells to the level observed in cells without exogenous cytokine supplementation. In addition, BNZ-1 was able to drastically block IL-15 and IL-2 induced phosphorylation events, specifically STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, ERK and Akt. The compound blocked IL-15 mediated viability and signaling more effectively than that mediated by IL-2. The BNZ-1 mediated decreased viability of PBMCs from T-LGLL patients was observed in the presence of either IL-2 or IL-15 stimulation and regardless of STAT3 mutational status. A potent reduction of IL-2 and IL-15 mediated STAT1, STAT3, STAT5 and ERK phosphorylation was also observed in T-LGLL PBMCs with BNZ-1 treatment. Proliferation of PBMCs from ATL patients was inhibited by 58 to 80 percent by the addition of either the antiIL-2Ra antibody daclizumab or and the combination treatment of daclizumab, anti-IL-15 and anti-IL-9. BNZ-1 at 10 \u00b5M inhibitedproliferation by 60 to 80 percent. Leukemic burden in the ATL tumor bearing mice was reduced by both BNZ-1 and Ruxo when compared to controls. The BNZ-1 treatment group showed comparable efficacy to that observed in the Ruxo group. Furthermore, BNZ-1 therapy was associated with lower levels of IL-2Ra, which reflects reduced tumor burden at 4 and 7 weeks when compared to that observed with the PBS group. In summary, BNZ-1 shows promise as a potential therapy for T-LGLL and ATL. Results from this study support its advancement in clinical trials in the treatment of T-LGLL and ATL patients.
