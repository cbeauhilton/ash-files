    "abstract_text": "Background. Patients with aggressive hematologic malignancies failing at least two lines of therapy are without further standard treatment options and have a poor prognosis. Identifying effective therapies with genomic-based precision medicine is hampered by intratumor heterogeneity and incomplete understanding of the contribution of various mutations within specific cancer phenotypes. Next-generation functional drug screening (ngFDS) in patient samples promises to overcome these challenges, however, proof of its clinical utility is limited. Methods. We investigated the feasibility and clinical impact of ngFDS measured at single-cell resolution using high-throughput automated microscopy in blood, bone marrow, pleural effusions, or excised lymph node biopsies (Figure 1A and Valdimer G et al. Nat Chem Biol. 2017). First, the accuracy of ngFDS to predict clinical outcome was evaluated in a retrospective cohort of 20 previously untreated patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Then, 48 patients with aggressive hematologic malignancies failing at least two lines of treatment were prospectively evaluated for ngFDS guided therapy, of which 17 could receive ngFDS-guided treatment. Individual ngFDS-guided treatment regimens were selected by a committee (EXALT-board) of hemato-oncologists, pathologist, and pharmacists based on top-candidate treatments identified by ngFDS, considering drug availability as well as safety profiles of single agents and previously reported combinations (Figure 1B). The majority of these patients (12/17) presented with aggressive lymphoma and had seen in median three (2-7) prior treatment lines (Figure 2A). Overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) of ngFDS-guided treatment were compared with ORR and PFS for the most recent regimen (MRR) on which patients had previously progressed. Results. ngFDS accurately predicted individual clinical response of AML patients to initial therapy. From prospectively analyzed patients receiving ngFDS guided treatment the ORR-ngFDS was 88% (15/17) compared to ORR-MRR of 24% (4/17; P<0.0004). Twelve (70%) of 17 patients had a PFS ratio of \u22651.3 and the mean PFS increased 3.9-fold, from 5.7 weeks to 22.6 weeks (P<0.007) (Figure 2B). Furthermore, analysis of an independent cohort revealed that ngFDS could positively and negatively predict patients' outcome to drug treatment. Conclusions. Automatedmicroscopy-based ngFDS is feasible and accurately predicts clinical response. It can successfully guide personalized treatment of aggressive refractory hematological malignancies.
