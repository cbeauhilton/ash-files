    "abstract_text": "Objective To analyze Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene internal- tandem duplications(ITD) mutation in various kinds of hematologic malignancy. Methods Polymerase chain reaction(PCR)was used to detect FLT3/ITD gene mutation in 103 AML cases, 63 ALL cases, 53 CML in chronic phase(CML-CP), 34 CML cases in blast crisis(CML-BC), 11 CLL cases, 36 MDS cases, 9 MM cases and 13 NHL cases with marrow infiltration. Results The mutation of FLT3/ITD gene was detected in 22.3% AML cases, in 6.5% CML -BC cases, in 5.6% MDS cases and in 2.6% ALL cases, This two ALL cases with FLT3/ITD mutation were both with myeloid antigen expression and were diagnosed as acute mixed-lineage leukemia after immunology examination. FLT3/ITD gene mutation were not detected in CML-CP, MM, NHL and CLL cases. FLT3/ITD+ AML shew high white blood cell count and high percentage of bone marrow blast cells and had a unfavourable cumulative relapse rates. Conclusion FLT3/ITD gene mutation was majority in AML cases and FLT3/ITD+ AML had a poor prognosis. Detection of FLT3/ITD gene mutation may be valuable in genotyping of leukemia, differential diagnosis between AML and ALL and estimate the prognosis of leukemia."
