    "abstract_text": "A prompt distinction of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) versus diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has important clinical implications. We analyzed 74 adult grey zone lymphomas (BL/DLBCL) and 10 reference pediatric BL using immunohistochemistry for Ki-67, CD10, bcl2 and bcl6, and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) for MYC , BCL2 and BCL6 breakpoints. Four hematopathologists reached a final (consensus) diagnosis independently in 80% of the reference BL, 24% of the test BL and 69% of the DLBCL. A MYC breakpoint was detected in all reference BL, 95% of the test BL and 35% of the DLBCL. BCL2 and BCL6 breakpoints were infrequent in BL (5 and 6%) and DLBCL (13% and 16%). Three BL and 5 DLBCL contained double breakpoints. A phenotypic shift to BL in the DLBCL group was indicated by the expression of CD10 and bcl6 in 67% and 91% of the cases, respectively. One third of all lymphomas showed a classical genotype and expression pattern of BL ( MYC breakpoint+, Ki-67>90%, CD10+, bcl6+, bcl2-) but only 63% of these cases were classified as BL. Our data indicate that a subgroup of DLBCL shares markers with BL, which is probably due to an overlapping histogenesis of both tumors.
