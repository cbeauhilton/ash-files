    "abstract_text": "Introduction Outcomes have improved in treating lymphoid malignancies but relapse remains an ongoing issue. The mTOR inhibitor, everolimus (RAD) and lenalidomide (LEN) have both shown clinically significant activity as single agents in patients with relapsed and refractory (R/R) Hodgkin (HL) and non-Hodgkin (NHL) lymphomas. The low toxicity and differing mechanisms of action were explored further by combining these active agents. A phase I/II clinical trial of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (RAD) and lenalidomide (LEN) was designed to explore the tolerability, toxicity and to determine the MTD of this combination for Phase II study. The phase I data is reported here. Methods This Phase I/II trial for patients with R/R lymphoid malignancy opened at Mayo Clinic between January 2011 and May 2013 and utilized a standard cohort of 3+3 design to determine the MTD of the combination. Eligibility required age\u226518, biopsy proven relapsed or refractory NHL or HL, ECOG PS 0, 1 or 2, measurable disease, Hb >9g/dl, ANC \u22651200/uL, platelet \u2265 50,000/uL, creatinine \u22641.5xULN and willingness to sign informed consent. Women of child bearing potential had pregnancy testing and all patients followed recommendations for contraception. Dose limiting toxicity was defined in cycle 1 as Gr 4 neutropenia \u22657days or platelets \u2264 25,000 \u22657days, grade 4 infection or grade \u22653 non-Heme toxicity at least possibly related to treatment per CTCAE v4.0. The starting dose (level 0) was RAD 5mg daily + LEN 10 mg/d X 21d in a 28-day cycle. Results Twenty-five patients were enrolled on the phase I portion and 23 are evaluable for analysis. The median age was 63 years (23-82) and 18 (78%) were male. Sixty-five percent had stage IV disease and 43% had 4 or more prior treatments (1- \u22655) including stem cell transplantation in 39%. Histologies included HL (n=3) and NHL (n=20)(DLBCL = 11, FL-III = 2, LPL = 3, MCL = 1, MF = 1, and other = 2). Two DLTs (rash, Gr4 neutropenia) were reported at the starting dose (level 0) and the protocol was amended for DLT definition change. At dose level -1 (RAD 5mg daily + LEN 5mg/d X 21d) a DLT (Gr4 neutropenia) was seen in only 1 of 6 patients so the study was re-opened to dose level 0 and 3 additional patients were treated without developing a DLT. At dose level +1 (RAD 5 mg daily + LEN 15mg/d X 21d) 1 Gr3 rash occurred and 2 patients experienced Gr4 neutropenia. Therefore the MTD was determined to be RAD 5mgdaily + LEN 10 mg/d X 21d. At least 1 Gr\u22653 adverse event was seen in 91% of patients. The most common Gr\u22653 toxicities were neutropenia (57%), leucopenia (52%), thrombocytopenia (39%), fatigue (22%), and anemia (13%). Eight of 23 patients (35%) had Gr\u22653 infection. Five patients discontinued study due to adverse events. One death on study occurred due to disease progression. Three patients continue on therapy. Responses have been seen in 4 patients and 10 patients have stable disease, encouraging signs in this heavily pretreated population. Conclusions This phase I/II trial of everolimus and lenalidomide in malignant lymphoma shows the combination to be tolerable with neutropenia as the main dose limiting toxicity. The MTD of this combination is RAD 5mg daily and LEN 10 mg/d X 21 d. Encouraging responses were seen. The phase II study has opened with 2 patients accrued to date. Updated results will be presented.
