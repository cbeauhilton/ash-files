Patients&Method: Between Nov 2009 and Feb 2011, we retrospectively analyzed IP features by flow cytometry (FCM) in 51 pts (46M;17F) with new diagnosed AML. Median age was 46 years (range: 14\u201371 ys). The mutations of NMP1 and FLT-3 TKD&ITD were determined by the methods of RQ-PCR or RFLP, respectively in the samples of bone marrow (n=31) or periheral blood (n=20) at the diagnosis. Antigenic expression of leukemic cells was analyzed by four-color FCM (FITC, PE, PerCP&APC) based by Nomdedeu et al researh (Leuk res 2011; 35:163) ( Table-1 ). Results: We detected NMP1+ mutation in 16 patients. Of these, three were associated with mutations of FLT3-ITD (n=2) or -TKD (n=1). Twelve patients had FLT3+ (9 ITD or 3 TKD). More than half of the patients without any mutation were CD15+/CD34+/HLA-DR+ and 11.5% for CD34 negative. Similarly, the patients with FLT-3 positive were mostly CD34+ as the pts w/o any mutations. Contrary, most of the pts with NMP1+ were CD34 negative (56.3%) ( Table 1 ). When evaluated the complete IP in leukemic cells, the expression of CD123 was significantly marked in the patients with NPM1+ and/or FLT3+ than those w/o mutations (p=0.008). While the co-expression of CD7 and CD117 was found in 67% of the pts w/o any mutations, 30% of the pts with NMP1 and/or FLT-3 ITD (p=0.01). CD56 expression was detected in more pts with NMP1+ than those with FLT-3+ (40% vs 8%, p=0.04). Besides, CD36 expression was positive in the all pts with FLT3-ITD than TKD+ (p=0.005). More intensive CD33 expression was seen in NMP1+ pts. The expression of CD64 was similar in all three mutations. Conclusion: Though NMP1 mutation was associated more CD34+ cells, more FLT3+ pts had CD34 positivity. The expression of CD123 was especially associated with the mutations. Aberrant expression of CD56 was in more pts with NPM1+, but CD36 for FLT3-ITD. These data might be a step for a study aiming to show a correlation between the type of mutations combined with IP features of leukemic cells and clinical characteristics or disease course of AML pts.
