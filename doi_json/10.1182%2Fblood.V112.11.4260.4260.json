    "abstract_text": "Dasatinib was approved for use in the treatment of patients (pts) with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and resistance to Imatinib. We applied a rescue treatment based on Dasatinib therapy to achieve a pharmacological immunomodulation in a setting of CML-relapsed allogenic stem cell transplantated (A-HSCT) pts. Patients were required to have both resistance to Imatinib and unresponsiveness to cellular therapy such as Donor Lymphocyte Induction (DLI). We hypothesized that Dasatinib could potentially improove the disease by immunomodulatory action. Primary aim of this therapeutic design was to address, in single institution trial, therapeutic force of a innovative pharmacologic strategy to induce the cytogenetic response followed by DLI. Therefore, we investigated Dasatinib ability to achieve immuno-effects by targeting key mediators of Th1, Th2, and Treg response. Biological effects were examined on conventional diagnostic parameters such as haematological chimerism, cariotype and Bcr-Abl gene transcript. Herein, we present interim results of a pilot group of 3pts. Patients received dasatinib 70 mg twice daily(140 mg total daily dose). Dose modifications were allowed for the management of toxicity. Treatment was performed until complete cytogenetic, molecular response and haematological full donor chimerism. Materials and Methods : To investigate the immunological changes, we used a TaqMan\u00ae Low Density Array, based on comparative C Tdd C T method on Applied Biosystems 7900HT, to perform relative quantification of cDNA derived from peripheral venous blood specimens harvested after DLI, before and after starting dasatinib therapy. Assumed that normal control values of all transcripts were = 1, we evaluated over or down regulation of gene expression profile (GEP) of a panel of 48 genes involved in immune response. Results: clinical changes after third month of dasatinib therapy. Case 1: responsive patient, maintained a mixed haematologic chimerism, but showed a complete cytogenetic and molecular remission. Following, patient restarted with DLI therapy. Case 2: responsive patient, showed nearly full-donor haematologic chimerism with complete cytogenetic and molecular remission. Case 3 : patient no evalutable because brief treatment (only 1 month). Dasatinib caused early haematological toxicity. Patient maintained a low level of donor T cells with presence of Philadelphia chromosome associated to elevated p210 molecular signal. Gene expression profiles post-dasatinib therapy: According to in vitro experiments (Blood October 25, 2007), in all cases we observed a down regulation of IL-2 and IL-12B (Th1), IL-6 and IL- 18, IL-10 (Th2) cytokines and mediators of apoptosis such as EGR2, EGR1. By contrast, multiple pro-inflammatory factors were up-expressed: IFN-g, IL-17, IL-7. Only in case number 1, TNF-a and IFN-g molecular pathways were not influenced by the drug. In fact their elevated expression was preserved as compared to pre-dasatinib levels. Noterworthy among cases number 2 and 3 (with mixed chimerism), Dasatinib improved a marked inhibition of Th1 effectors in addition to down-regulation of several important molecular transcripts: SERPIN B3\u2013B4, BCL2A1, SELP, PIAS 1, IRF8, IRF1, CCL7, CCL5, CXCL9, CCR4, ICAM. Regards to T regulatory cells, Foxp3 was strongly up-regulated in case number 1 and down-regulated in case2and 3. Conclusion: We think that Dasatinib represent a possibility of cure for for CML pts relapsed after A-HSCT and unresponsive to alternative treatments. For imatinib-resistant CML patients, such as in this study, there are few currently available effective options. The present results strongly emphasize the importance of immune response control to achieve the desired clinical effects."
