    "abstract_text": "The JAK2V617F mutation has been recently reported in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and a proportion of patients with ET and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. This acquired point mutation constitutively activates JAK2 tyrosine kinase and is believed to underlie growth factor hypersensitivity displayed by hematopoietic progenitors in these disorders. Identification of this genetic abnormality may be useful for diagnostic purposes although its prognostic implication remains to be determined. The prevalence of this mutation in granulocytes from ET patients ranges from 23 to 57% depending on the detection technique used. ET is characterized by predominant involvement of the megakaryocytic lineage and increased platelet production. In order to evaluate whether the frequency of the V617FJAK2 mutation in platelets from ET patients differs from that previously reported in granulocytes, we amplified a fragment of JAK2 cDNA from leukocyte-depleted platelets by RT-PCR followed by digestion with Bsa XI restriction endonuclease (PCR-RFLP). The JAK2V617F mutation abolishes a Bsa XI restriction site present in the wild-type sequence and generates a different band pattern. In addition, allele-specific RT-PCR (ASPCR) was performed with a primer pair common to both wild-type and mutant alleles and a third primer complementary to the mutant allele. Forty four patients with ET diagnosed according to the PVSG criteria were included, median age 39 years old (14\u201381), 10 were men; 21 were studied before treatment, 10 during treatment with anagrelide or hydroxyurea and 13 both before and during treatment. Twenty-two (50%) patients were found to harbour the JAK2V617F mutation by both PCR-RFLP and ASPCR, 3 were homozygous. No change in genotype was found in repeated samples from patients studied both before and during treatment. Hemoblobin levels and the frequency of thrombosis were significantly higher in patients with the mutation respect to those without (141 \u00b114 g/L vs. 129 \u00b1 11 g/L, p=0.009, and 41% vs. 4.5%, p=0.004, respectively). In addition, patients carrying the mutation were significantly older (51 vs. 33 years old, p=0.002) and had lower platelet counts at diagnosis (1.070 x 10 9 /L vs. 1.500 x 10 9 /L, p=0.02). Interestingly, 2 patients harbouring the mutation developed PV on follow-up. In conclusion, the prevalence of the JAK2V617F mutation in platelets from ET patients did not differ from that previously reported in granulocytes. The increase in the frequency of thrombosis found in patients carrying the mutation should be confirmed in a larger study. Besides, the finding of higher hemoglobin levels in this group of patients is of interest since JAK2V617F-positive ET patients have been reported to display PV markers such as endogenous erythroid colony growth and PRV-1 overexpression, suggesting they may have larger involvement of the erythroid lineage. Further studies will help clarify whether the risk of developing PV is higher in this subset of patients."
