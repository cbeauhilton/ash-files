    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma that if not cured with aggressive chemoimmunotherapy and stem cell transplant is usually fatal. The intravenous proteasome inhibitor bortezomib produces an overall response rate (ORR) of 33% in patients with relapsed MCL ( J Clin Oncol  2006 ; 24 (30): 4867 \u201374 ). Unfortunately, most patients eventually relapse and new agents are needed for this disease. Two recently conducted phase II trials (NHL-002 and NHL-003) tested single-agent lenalidomide for patients with relapsed MCL. Fifty-four patients with MCL were enrolled into the two studies; 26% (14/54) had received prior bortezomib and they are the subject of this report. Methods: Patients with relapsed or refractory MCL and measurable disease 2 cm after at least one prior treatment regimen including prior bortezomib were eligible. Patients received 25 mg of lenalidomide orally once daily on days 1\u201321 of every 28-day cycle. Therapy was continued as tolerated or until disease progression. The 1999 IWLRC methodology was used to assess response and progression. Results: The 14 patients in this study were heavily pretreated with a median of 4 (2\u20136) prior treatments (including bortezomib) and 50% were bortezomib-refractory. Median age was 66 (45\u201384) years and 6 (43%) patients were female. Median time from diagnosis to lenalidomide treatment was 3.3 (0.7\u20137.6) years. The ORR with lenalidomide was 57% (8/14), including 21% (3/14) complete response (CR)/unconfirmed CR and 36% (5/14) partial responses. One (7%) patient had stable disease. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (50%), thrombocytopenia (43%), anemia (21%), fatigue (21%), and leukopenia (21%). Neutropenic fever occurred in 7% of patients. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that lenalidomide oral monotherapy is very effective with manageable side effects in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL who had received prior treatment with bortezomib.",
