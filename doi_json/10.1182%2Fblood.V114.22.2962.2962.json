    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2962 Poster Board II-938 HOX homeobox genes are important regulators of normal and malignant hematopoiesis and abdominal-type HOXA -cluster genes, in particular HOXA7 to HOXA10 , are highly leukemogenic. However, little is known about the transforming abilities of anterior HOXA genes HOXA1 to HOXA6 despite a high prevalence of anterior HOX -expression in acute leukemia. Here we performed a comprehensive assessment of the oncogenic potential of every HOXA gene in primary hematopoietic cells. With exception of HOXA2 and HOXA5 all other HOXA genes caused a block or delay of hematopoietic differentiation in serial replating assays and all HOX genes also cooperated with Meis1 . No evidence for the alleged tumor-suppressor function of HOXA5 could be found. Whereas all other active HOXA genes induced the outgrowth of mixed granulocytic/monocytic cells, HOXA13 preferentially specified the development of monocytes/macrophages. Albeit more weakly than HOXA9 also the anterior HOXA genes HOXA1 , HOXA4 , and HOXA6 transformed cells and generated permanent myelomonocytic cell lines arrested at various stages of differentiation. HOX -RNA profiling revealed that each of these lines also transcribed HOXA9 . However, kinetic studies with inducible HOX -derivatives showed that HOXA9 expression was not under control by anterior HOXA proteins. Cellular differentiation was induced immediately after loss of anterior HOX activity and HOXA9 down regulation was a secondary event during maturation. This proves that anterior HOX proteins are able to transform hematopoetic cells through an individual contribution independent of HOXA9 . In summary our results explain how HOXA9 can predominate in hematologic malignancies while simultaneously it is not necessarily required for transformation.
