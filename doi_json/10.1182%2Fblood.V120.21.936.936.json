    "abstract_text": "Abstract 936 Demonstration of bone marrow (BM) infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is essential to the diagnosis of WM, and a trephine biopsy is considered mandatory for this assessment. Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) has demonstrated its clinical relevance in MGUS and myeloma; however, immunophenotypic studies on IgM monoclonal gammopathies are scanty, and focus only in patients with WM. Herein, MFC immunophenotyping was performed on BM samples from 244 patients, including 67 IgM MGUS, 77 smoldering, and 100 symptomatic WM newly diagnosed patients according to the Second International Workshop. A four color panel that systematically allowed the identification of B cells and plasma cells (PC), and their phenotypic characterization for a total of 24 antigens was used. We first analyzed the percentage of B cells and PC in BM and the percentage of light chain restricted cells in both compartments. Our results show a progressive increment of B cells from IgM MGUS to smoldering and symptomatic WM (medians of 2%, 9% and 12%; P10% B cells, in contrast to 34% and 55% of smoldering and symptomatic WM (P10% vs \u226410%: median TTP of 47m vs 145m; P=.016) and light chain restricted B cells (100% vs 10% B cells showed a trend for inferior OS (P=.080), and significant differences emerged when comparing patients with 100% vs <100% light chain restricted B cells (median OS 44m vs 78m; P=.001). The later marker was independent (HR: 2.6; P=.004) of the International Prognostic Scoring System (HR: 2.2; P=.006). Focusing on the antigenic profiles of B cells and PC, we noted that within the B-cell compartment there was a progressive increment of CD22dim (69%, 92% and 88%; P50% of WM patients, which raises the possibility that the WM clone may arise, at least in some cases, before antigenic stimulation; subsequent maturation of the clone into PC would explain the typical presence of somatic hypermutations. On the other hand, B-cells from IgM MGUS and WM patients were negative in \u226590% of cases for CD5, CD10, CD11c and CD103, which can be useful to differentiate between WM and other B-NHL. Finally, the antigenic profile of PC in IgM MGUS and WM was similar to that of normal PC, and different from myeloma PC by consistently showing a CD27+ and CD56- phenotype, in addition to sIgM+ expression in \u226587% of all cases. Similarly to B-cells, we also noted that within the PC compartment there was a progressive increment of CD19+, CD45+ and sIgM+ CD20+ PC from IgM MGUS to smoldering and symptomatic WM. This underlies that this transition is asssociated with an accumulation of light chain restricted clonal PC displaying an immature/plasmablastic phenotype. In summary, our results highlight the potential value of MFC immunophenotyping for the characterization of the Waldenstro\u0308m's clone, as well as for the differential diagnosis, risk of progression and survival in WM.
