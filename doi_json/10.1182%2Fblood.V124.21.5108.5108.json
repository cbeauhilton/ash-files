    "abstract_text": "Introduction Recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven\u00ae Copenhagen, Denmark) is used in the management of bleeding in patients with hemophilia. A generic biosimilar version of NovoSeven\u00ae is also developed for same indication (AryoSeven\u2122, AryoGen, Tehran-Iran). The two products exhibit comparable compositional and biochemical profile. To compare the activation profile of NovoSeven\u00ae and AryoSeven\u2122, two commercially available protein complex concentrates (PCCs) were used. The activation profiles were studied utilizing SDS- gel electrophoresis profile and immunoblotting using anti-rabbit recombinant thrombin antibody. Materials & Methods NovoSeven\u00ae, AryoSeven\u2122, Profilnine\u00ae SD (Grifols Biologicals Inc. USA), and Beriplex\u00ae (CSL Behring Canada, Inc.) were obtained commercially. Recombinant human thrombin antibodies were generated in rabbits. Recothrom\u00ae was commercially obtained (Zymogenetic, Seatle,Wa- USA and Medicine Company ,Parsippany, NJ \u2013USA). Tissue factor RecombiPlasTin 2G was obtained from Instrumentation Laboratory Company (Bedford- USA). NovoSeven\u00ae and AryoSeven\u2122 were diluted with saline to make working solution of 1mg/ml. Further dilutions were made with saline to obtain 0.5 \u00b5g/ml, 1.25\u00b5g/ml, and 2.5\u00b5g/ml rFVIIa preparations. To make working solution of PCCs, PCCs were diluted to 10 U/ml in saline. The sample mixtures contain 2U/ml PCCs, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 \u00b5g/ml rFVIIa, and with RecombiPlasTin 2G at 1:5 ratio. The samples mixtures incubated in 5, 15, and 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 c . SDS-PAGE (Pierce Biotechnology) and immunoblotting carried against Recothrom\u00ae. Results Profilnine\u00ae SD activated by RecombiPlasTin 2G resulted in conversions of prothrombin to prethrombin and thrombin at 5 to 30 minutes incubation time as evident by the generation of distinct bands at 50kDa and 36 kDa. However, addition of rFVIIa at final concentration range of 0.25 and 0.5\u00b5g/ml to the same mixture resulted in total conversion of prothrombin to thrombin at 30 minutes with a doublet bands at 36 kDa. Recombinant FVIIa alone failed to generate thrombin in native Profilnine\u00ae SD at 5 to 30 minutes as evident by the absence of 36 kDa band in the SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting studies. Further studies comparing NovoSeven\u00ae and AryoSeven\u2122 (FC: 0.1\u00b5g/ml) in the activated Profilnine\u00ae SD resulted in a comparable and progressive generation of thrombin at 5 and 15 minutes incubation time. At 5 and 15 minutes residual prethrombin bands were noted which was less intense at 15 minute incubation time in both rFVIIa preparations. Although rFVIIa alone unable to generate thrombin in native Beriplex\u00ae, the presence of rFVIIa in activated Beriplex did not change the activation profile. Activated Beriplex\u00ae by RecombiPlasTin 2G resulted in complete conversion of prothrombin to thrombin at 30 minutes incubation time. A complete generation of thrombin was noted in both activated PCCs in the presence of rFVIIa at final concentrations of 0.25\u00b5g/ml and 0.5\u00b5g/ml. At 5 minutes residual prothrombin and prethrombin bands were noted in the presence of rFVIIa at final concentration of 0.1\u00b5g/ml. However, at 15 minutes prothrombin bands were completely disappeared and prethrombin bands were less intense at same concentration of 0.1\u00b5g/ml of rFVIIa. The results obtained by Western blot analysis confirmed the differential activation of Profilnine\u00ae SD and Beriplex\u00ae. However, both the NovoSeven\u00ae and AryoSeven\u2122 exhibited similar activation profiles. Conclusions These results indicate that the activation of PCCs by both AryoSeven\u2122 and NovoSeven\u00ae result in comparable generation of thrombin. Furthermore, while both rFVIIa produced similar activation profile, PCCs based differences in the activation profile were noted. These studies provide an in vitro profiling of the effects of activated FVIIa on the generation of thrombin and related enzymes to demonstrate biosimilarity of the branded and generic versions of these haemostatic products.
