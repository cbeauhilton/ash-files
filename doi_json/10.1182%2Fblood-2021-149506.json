    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are a heterogeneous group of lymphomas classically treated with CHOP or CHOP-like regimens, with poor outcomes. CD30 is universally expressed and is pathognomonic in systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL), with variable expression among non-sALCL PTCL subtypes (40-60%). Recent data of frontline treatment with Brentuximab Vedotin (BV), an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody, plus CHOP has demonstrated significant improvement in survival (ECHELON-2 clinical trial), becoming the new standard of care for sALCL in Europe. PATIENT AND METHODS: From February 2019 to April 2021, 21 patients with de novo newly diagnosed CD30+ PTCL have been treated with the combination of BV-CHP, in the centers of the Catalan Institute of Oncology in Spain. Survival curves were plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Clinical characteristics at diagnosis are shown in the table. Of interest, 5 of the 11 ALK negative ALCL patients were diagnosed of breast implant associated ALCL (BIA-ALCL) with extracapsular involvement. The number of cycles administrated were 108, with a median of 6 cycles per patient (range 1-6), all of them with G-CSF primary prophylaxis. At the time of this report, 1 patient was still on treatment and 2 patients without the final evaluation. Seven cycles (6%) were delayed (3 due to infection, 2 due to neutropenia grade 2, and 2 due to causes not related with chemotherapy).An adverse event was reported in 45 (44%) cycles, being the most frequent peripheral neuropathy in 14, nausea/vomiting in 9 and anemia in 8; all of them grade 1-2. Treatment was discontinued after 1 cycle in 1 patient due to progression. Of the 18 evaluable patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was of 83%, with 72% complete responses and 11% partial responses. Consolidative autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) was performed in 5 patients. With a median follow-up of 14 months (limits: 1-24), 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 68.2% (95% CI 44.6-91.7) and 82.2% (95% CI 63.9-100), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Brentuximab Vedotin plus CHP is an effective regimen for CD30 positive PTCL, with a high rate of response. This combination presents a manageable safety profile, with the majority of patients completing the planned treatment. The incidence and severity of side effects are low, being peripheral neuropathy and neutropenia the most frequent.
