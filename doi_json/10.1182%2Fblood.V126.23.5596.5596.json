    "abstract_text": "Background: Mantle cell lymphoma is a B cell lymphoma (CD5 +) which represents 5-10 % of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Most patients have advanced disease at presentation and thus carry a poor prognosis. This type of uncommon malignant lymphoma has a distinct and recurring cytogenetic abnormality involving t(11, 14) q(13, 32). Although extra nodal involvement is common, not many cases of MCL having concomitant other malignancies are reported. We hypothesized that patients with MCL have chronic immunosuppression, comparable to chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, and therefore are at risk for developing secondary malignancies similar to CLL patients. The aim of our study is to report the retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with MCL and the associated secondary malignancies before or after the diagnosis of MCL. Patients and methods: The records of 41 patients who presented with MCL to \"The David Lee Cancer Center\" at CAMC, WVU with MCL from 2000 - 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The number of other malignancies presenting before or after the diagnosis of MCL were analyzed. Results: The population with MCL was represented by 41, all Caucasian patients, which were 75.6% male (n = 31) and had an average age of 68.6 \u00b1 11.3 years. Mean follow up for all patients was 23.9 \u00b1 32.43 months. A total of 14.6% (n=6), 83.3% males, experienced a second primary. Within the second primaries 50.0% were GI cancers which included pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma while 16.7% were prostate cancer, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or adenocarcinoma of lungs. The time to second primaries varied with 50% of the cases being diagnosed simultaneously with MCL, while 33.3% were diagnosed prior to MCL at an average time of 34.5 months, and 16.7% were diagnosed post MCL diagnosis at an average time of 18 months. Conclusion: Patients with MCL are typically CD5 positive, CD10 negative, and CD23 negative which make it different from other lymphomas like small cell lymphoma, B-cell CLL that are CD 23 positive. Rare cases of MCL may be CD5 negative or CD23 Positive. We hypothesized that MCL patients have an increased risk for developing secondary cancers due to their disease biology and from underlying chronic immunosuppression. Patients with MCL have twice the risk of developing secondary malignancies and an increased frequency of certain types of cancers such as cholangiocarcinoma & pancreatic cancer.
