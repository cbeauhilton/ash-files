    "abstract_text": "Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the leading drugs in the treatment of leukemia, but extensive metabolism to 7-hydroxymethotrexate (7-OHMTX) can limit its therapeutic efficacy. In this study we investigated whether 7-OHMTX itself can provoke antifolate resistance that may further disrupt MTX efficacy. For this purpose we developed resistance to 7-OHMTX as well as MTX in two human leukemia cell lines (CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4) by stepwise exposure to increasing concentrations of 7-OHMTX and MTX. Consequently, both leukemia cell lines displayed marked levels of resistance to 7-OHMTX (>10 fold) and MTX (>75 fold), respectively. The underlying mechanism of resistance in the MTX-exposed cells was a marked decrease (>10-fold) in reduced folate carrier (RFC)-mediated cellular uptake of MTX. This was associated with transcriptional silencing of the RFC gene in MTX-resistant CCRF-CEM cells. In contrast, the molecular basis for the resistance to 7-OHMTX was solely due to a marked decreased (> 95%) in folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity which conferred >100-fold MTX resistance upon a short term exposure to this drug. This is the first demonstration that 7-OHMTX can provoke distinct modalities of antifolate resistance as compared to the parent drug MTX.",
