    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is currently the only curative treatment for the bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia (FA) patients. However, recent advances in lentiviral-mediated gene therapy have shown that corrected FA HSCs develop an in vivo proliferation advantage, facilitating the engraftment of corrected HSCs in non-conditioned FA patients. Based on these observations, we proposed that gene editing might constitute a promising alternative to correct patients' hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in this disorder. Since non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the most frequent repair pathway in HSCs, particularly in FA-HSCs, we aimed at exploiting this DNA repair mechanism to remove/compensate specific mutations in different FANC genes by the use of CRISPR/Cas9 system, thus mimicking spontaneous genetic reversions observed in FA mosaic patients. Our results in lymphoblastic cell lines from five different complementation groups (FANCA, FANCB , FANCC , FANCD2 and FANCD1 / BRCA2 ) demonstrated the efficiency of this approach to generate potentially corrective events in all the different complementation groups studied. Importantly, corrected cells showed a marked proliferative advantage after in vitro culture and the analysis by next generation sequencing confirmed the expansion of cells harboring therapeutic events. Functional studies showing the reversion of mitomycin C sensitivity, FANCD2 foci formation and chromosomal instability supported the phenotypic correction of different mutations by NHEJ-mediated gene editing. Moving towards the clinical application of NHEJ-mediated repair we focused on improving the gene editing efficiency in HSCs. To this aim, chemically modified small guide RNAs (MS-sgRNAs) enabled us to increase the editing efficacy 8-fold compared to efficacies obtained with in vitro transcribed sgRNAs, reaching up to 89% indels in healthy donor hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Moreover, the CRISPR/Cas9 system demonstrated high editing capacity in the primitive HSCs capable of engrafting immunodeficient NSG mice, confirming the efficacy of NHEJ-editing to correct the phenotype of long-term repopulating HSCs. Finally, studies conducted in mobilized peripheral blood and bone marrow CD34 + cells from FA patients demonstrated the feasibility to correct FA HSCs by NHEJ-mediated gene editing and confirmed the proliferative advantage of NHEJ-mediated corrected cells both in vitro and in vivo . Our results suggest that NHEJ-mediated gene editing should constitute a versatile and simple therapeutic approach to efficiently correct specific mutations in FA and other monogenic disorders of the hematopoietic system.
