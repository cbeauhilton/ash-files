    "abstract_text": "Abstract 141 Introduction: T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) arises from clonal expansion of a lymphoid progenitor that has undergone stepwise alteration at distinct stages of differentiation. It is suggested that a set of cooperative mutations that affect different pathways are required before thymocytes become fully malignant. Despite major improvements in our understanding of the molecular genetics of T-ALL, the underlying mechanisms that lead to the abnormal proliferation and enhanced survival of the leukemic cells remain largely unknown. Results: Array CGH analysis revealed an acquired homozygous microdeletion at chromosome 18p11 in 6 % of T-ALL cases. The deleted region was only 125 kb in size and restricted to the PTPN2 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 2) locus. PTPN2 encodes an intracellular non-transmembrane tyrosine-specific phosphatase that functions as a negative regulator of a variety of signaling proteins including several members of the janus kinase (JAK) and of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) families, growth factor receptors and SRC family kinases. Homozygous deletion of PTPN2 was specifically found in cases with aberrant expression of the TLX1 transcription factor, with two cases also harboring the NUP214-ABL1 fusion. Analysis of additional TLX1 positive cases by quantitative PCR identified loss of one copy of PTPN2 in 5 out of 20 cases. No mutations were detected in the coding region of PTPN2 . To determine the effect of loss of PTPN2 in T-cells, we downregulated the expression of PTPN2 using RNAi technology. siRNA mediated knock-down of PTPN2 affected activation of JAK1 associated cytokine receptors implicated in T-cell development. Ligand stimulation of IL7 and interferon gamma receptor resulted in an augmented and prolonged phosphorylation of JAK1 as well as downstream targets STAT1 and STAT5 in T-ALL cell lines with knock-down of PTPN2. In addition, knock- down of Ptpn2 sensitized the pro B-cell line Ba/F3 to transformation by wild type JAK1 confirming a clear relationship between loss of PTPN2 and JAK1 activation. Knock-down of PTPN2 expression also provided a proliferative advantage and reduced sensitivity to kinase inhibitors in lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines HSB-2 and ALL-SIL. Conclusion: In conclusion, our data provide genetic and functional evidence for a tumor suppressor role of PTPN2 in T-ALL and warrant testing of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of this specific subset of T-ALLs as well as further analysis of a potential negative impact of loss of PTPN2 on responsiveness to anti-cancer treatments.
