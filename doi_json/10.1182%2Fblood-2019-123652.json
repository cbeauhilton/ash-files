    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Immune checkpoint inhibition targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is insufficient to induce clinical response in relapsed or refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM). We postulated that combining atezolizumab (A; anti-PD-L1) with daratumumab (D; anti-CD38), which targets myeloma cells and has immunomodulatory activity, may alter the tumor microenvironment (TME) to favor cytotoxic T-cell activation and clinical activity. To assess the immunologic efficacy of this combination, we studied changes in CD8+ T cells in D-na\u00efve and D-refractory pts from a Phase Ib study (GO29695; NCT02431208). Methods: Flow cytometry was performed using longitudinal peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow aspirates (BMA) to characterize CD8+ cytotoxic T cells using 8 color flow panels. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and dual-plex immunohistochemistry (IHC) (CD138/CD8, CD8/Ki-67, CD138/osteoclast) were performed using longitudinal CD138+ fraction and bone biopsies, respectively. For IHC, CD138+ cell masses of >5000\u03bcm 2 were defined as tumor clusters. Osteoclasts were enumerated based on TRAP positivity and morphology. Table 1 shows on-treatment changes in Cohorts D1-D3. Table 2 shows baseline data in Cohorts A, B, D1-D3, and E. The median (bootstrap 95% CI) is used to describe the data. Results: 9/36 (25%) pts in cohorts D1-3 showed clinical efficacy (partial response or better); all were D-na\u00efve. We studied CD8+ T-cell activation and proliferation (%CD8+HLA-DR+Ki-67+), the pharmacodynamic marker for A (Herbst et al. Nature 2014), in PB. All D-naive pts showed on-treatment increase in %CD8+HLA-DR+Ki-67+ cells in the periphery (C1D15-C2D1) compared to baseline, which was not observed in D-refractory pts ( Table 1 ). In BMA, the increase in %CD8+HLA-DR+Ki-67+ (C2D15-C4D1) was observed in D-na\u00efve pts with clinical response to A-D (sensitive), but not in non-responders (resistant) or D-refractory pts (all resistant), suggesting that sensitive pts have an immune-supportive TME. Preliminary IHC staining also showed an increase in CD8+Ki-67+ T cells in two responders after treatment. Gene enrichment analysis (RNAseq data, n=20) showed upregulation of an innate immune response signature, which appeared to be driven by a 'macrophage activation' gene signature post-treatment, in the CD138+ fraction of responders. To understand the mechanisms regulating sensitivity to treatment, we studied the spatial localization of CD8+ T cells with respect to CD138+ tumor cells by IHC. A higher density of CD8+ T cells within tumor clusters was seen at baseline in sensitive versus resistant pts, but this was not observed outside of tumor clusters ( Table 1 ). In addition, the number of osteoclasts in the tumor region was higher in resistant pts, suggesting that these cells may contribute to the inhibition of T-cell function as reported(An et al. Blood 2016). This hypothesis was further supported by higher osteoclast numbers in D-refractory pts at baseline ( Table 2 ), for whom an on-treatment increase in %CD8+HLA-DR+Ki-67+ cells was not observed in PB or BMA. Interestingly, higher median fluorescence intensity of PD-1 on CD8+ T-effector cells and on CD8+ T-effector memory cells was observed at baseline in D-na\u00efve relative to D-refractory pts, while the level of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells was similar. An increase in activated proliferating T cells (%CD8+HLA-DR+Ki-67+) observed after treatment in D-na\u00efve responders suggests that high PD-1 expression in this subset is not a marker of CD8+ T-cell exhaustion, but of functional capability. Conclusions: Clinical efficacy of A-D therapy in R/R MM pts is associated with higher CD8+ cell density in tumor clusters and lower osteoclast numbers in the tumor region at baseline, and an on-treatment increase in activated CD8+ T-cell populations in the bone marrow. The lack of a D-monotherapy arm in this study makes it difficult to assess the individual contribution of A to T-cell activation. The data presented, albeit a small number of samples from a Phase Ib study, support the hypothesis that the TME, including CD8+ T cells, tumor cells, and cells of myeloid lineage such as osteoclasts, has significant impact on the immunologic and clinical efficacy of combination therapy. A better understanding of the complex interplay between myeloma cells and their immune environment should pave the way for designing better immunotherapies with the potential for long-term disease control.

In the United States, atezo is approved for treatment of pts with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy (chemo) and whose tumors express PD\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u0161\u00e2'\u00ac\u00c3'\u00c2L1, or are not eligible for any platinum\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u0161\u00e2'\u00ac\u00c3'\u00c2containing chemo regardless of PD\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u0161\u00e2'\u00ac\u00c3'\u00c2L1 status, or have disease progression during or following any platinum-containing chemo, or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemo. Atezo is also approved: in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin for first-line treatment of pts with metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and for pts with metastatic NSCLC who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemo; in combination with paclitaxel protein-bound for the treatment of adults with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer whose tumors express PD-L1; and in combination with carboplatin and etoposide, for the first-line treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Atezo is not approved for treatment of pts with multiple myeloma."
