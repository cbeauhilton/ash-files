    "abstract_text": "Human megakaryocytes (MKs) release trillions of platelets each day into the circulation to maintain normal homeostatic platelet levels. However, the signals that control platelet biogenesis in vivo remain incompletely understood. We have recently identified that extracellular sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) plays a key role in thrombopoiesis. Using conditional mutants and intravital multiphoton microscopy, we demonstrate that the lipid mediator S1P serves as a critical directional cue guiding the elongation of megakaryocytic proplatelet (PP) extensions from the interstitium into bone marrow sinusoids and triggering the subsequent shedding of PPs into the blood. Correspondingly, mice lacking the S1P receptor S1pr1 develop severe thrombocytopenia caused by both formation of aberrant extravascular PPs and defective intravascular PP shedding. In contrast, activation of S1pr1 signaling leads to the prompt release of new platelets into the circulating blood. In addition to its role as an extracellular mediator, S1P can also function as a second messenger within the intracellular compartment. Correspondingly, we have demonstrated that MKs express the S1P-generating enzyme sphingosine kinase 2 (Sphk2). Sphk2 predominantly localizes to the nucleus and is the major source of intracellular S1P in MKs. Loss of Sphk2 significantly reduced intracellular S1P in MKs and downregulated the expression and activity of Src family kinases (SFKs). At the same time, loss of Sphk2 and inhibition of SFK activity resulted in defective intravascular PP shedding, the final stage of thrombopoiesis. Correspondingly, mice lacking Sphk2 in the hematopoietic system display thrombocytopenia. Collectively, our findings uncover a novel function of S1P as master regulator of efficient thrombopoiesis and might raise new therapeutic options for patients with thrombocytopenia.
