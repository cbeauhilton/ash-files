    "abstract_text": "Background: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) accounts for approximately 5-7% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, eg ibrutinib, are indicated for treatment of adults with MCL who have received \u22651 prior therapy. Primary and acquired resistance to ibrutinib is common and linked with poor outcomes, and remains an unmet medical need. Parsaclisib, a potent, highly-selective, next-generation PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor, demonstrated clinical activity in patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory (R/R) NHL. We report preliminary results for parsaclisib monotherapy in a cohort of pts with R/R MCL who were previously treated with ibrutinib in the open-label, phase 2 study CITADEL-205 (NCT03235544). Methods: Pts must be \u226518 years of age with pathologically confirmed MCL, R/R disease to the most recent treatment, documented cyclin D1 overexpression or t(11;14) translocation, have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) \u22642, and received 1 to 3 prior systemic treatments (including ibrutinib). Prior treatment with PI3Ki was prohibited. Pts were allocated to receive parsaclisib 20 mg once daily (QD) for 8 weeks followed by either 20 mg once weekly (weekly-dosing group [WG]) or 2.5 mg QD (daily-dosing group [DG]). Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) was required. Objective response rate (ORR) was the primary endpoint; complete response rate (CRR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety and tolerability were secondary endpoints. All radiology-based endpoints were based on independent review. Results: From October 2017 to January 17, 2020 (data cut-off), 47 pts were treated (WG, n = 12; DG, n = 35). Enrollment is ongoing. At cut-off, 70% of pts had discontinued treatment, most commonly due to progressive disease (62%). Median exposure (range) was 2.2 (0.1-18.0) months. Median age was 70 years and 79% of pts were men. Median time since initial diagnosis was 4.7 years. Most pts (85%) had ECOG PS \u22641 and 51% had high-risk MCL International Prognostic Index. The median number of prior systemic therapies was 3; 38% of pts had prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and 38% were refractory to most recent systemic therapy. At data cut-off, 46 pts were evaluable for efficacy, including 12 in WG and 34 in DG (Table) . Median follow-up (range) for this population was 10.2 months (1.5-25.9) overall and 7.6 months (1.5-25.9) for DG. ORR (95% confidence interval [CI]) and CRR were 28.3% (16.0-43.5) and 2.2%, respectively in all evaluable pts, and 35.3% (19.7-53.5) and 2.9%, respectively in DG. Median time to complete or partial response was 7.6 weeks. Median DOR (95% CI) was 7.3 months (0.2-not estimable) among all responders and 3.7 months (0.2-7.3) for DG. Median PFS (95% CI) was 3.65 months (1.9-3.9) overall and 3.65 months (1.9-5.5) for DG. Among 47 safety-evaluable pts, most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in >10% of pts were anemia (19.1%), diarrhea (19.1%), neutropenia (14.9%), asthenia and cough (12.8% each), decreased appetite, dyspnea, fatigue, pyrexia and rash (10.6% each). Most common grade \u22653 TEAEs reported in \u22655% of pts included anemia (12.8%), neutropenia (10.6%), thrombocytopenia and rash (6.4% each). TEAEs leading to dose interruption or reduction occurred in 31.9% and 2.1% of pts, respectively. TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 2 (4.3%) pts (diarrhea and colitis). Serious TEAEs reported in \u22652 pts were diarrhea, dyspnea, peripheral swelling and pneumonia (4.3% each). Two pts experienced fatal TEAEs (one pt had general physical health deterioration and respiratory tract infection, deemed not related to treatment; one pt had pneumonia, neutropenia, and septic shock, deemed related to treatment and disease progression). New or worsening grade \u22653 laboratory test values of clinical interest occurring in \u22655% of pts included decreased neutrophils (14.9%), platelets (10.6%), and hemoglobin (8.5%); there were no grade \u22653 increases in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase. Conclusion: Preliminary efficacy data indicate that parsaclisib monotherapy is clinically active in this difficult-to-treat patient population. Treatment with parsaclisib had an acceptable safety profile and was generally well tolerated. Updated study results will be presented.
