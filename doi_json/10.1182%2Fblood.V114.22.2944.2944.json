    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2944 Poster Board II-920 Introduction: The chromosomal translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32) represents a specific tumor marker in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). This chromosomal aberration involves the MYC oncogene on chromosome 8 and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) locus on chromosome 14. We have previously demonstrated that this genetic abnormality can be used as a marker of Minimal Disseminated Disease (MDD) in BL (Mussolin et al, JCO, 2007). The aim of the study was to assess of the prevalence of MDD in BL at diagnosis in children enrolled in the AIEOP LNH-97 clinical protocol and the evaluation of its impact on prognosis. Patients and Methods: We established a simplified long-distance PCR (LD-PCR) assay which can amplify up to 15-20 Kb DNA sequence making it possible to detect the t(8;14) at the genomic level with the sensitivity of 10 -4 . The assay was based on 4 separate PCR reactions in which one primer complementary to the first exon of the MYC gene is used with one of four primers for the IgH locus (1 for the JH region and 1 for each of the 3 constant regions). Results: LD-PCR was applied to prospectively study 124 BL biopsies and detected a specific PCR product in 88 of them (71%). Of the 88 positive BL patients we studied both the tumor and the bone marrow (BM) at diagnosis in 76: BM was positive by LD-PCR in 25 patients (33%), whereas only 10 (13%) were positive at the standard morphological and/or immunophenotypical analyses. Most of the MDD positive patients (88%) belonged to the R4 Risk Group according to BFM definition (stage III or stage IV according to St. Jude staging classification and LDH\u22651000 U/l). The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 68% (SE 10%) in MDD positive R4 patients compared with 96% (SE 4%) in MDD negative R4 patients (p= 0.02), whereas there was no difference in PFS between children with morphological involvement of BM at diagnosis versus those who had negative BM (PFS=62.5% (SE 17%) vs. PFS= 87% (SE 6%), respectively, p= 0.09). By multivariate analysis (including MDD, gender, LDH, CNS involvement) MDD was predictive of higher risk of failure (Hazard Ratio: 8.4 , p= 0.04). Conclusions: We demonstrated that MDD identifies a poor prognosis subgroup among high risk Burkitt's lymphoma patients. We suggest that a more effective risk-adapted therapy, possibly including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, should be considered in these patients.
