    "abstract_text": "Introduction Myelofibrosis (MF), a BCR-ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), has an annual incidence of 1 in 100000 for the primary MF and 0.3-0.7 in 100000 for secondary MF in the USA. MF patients have a median survival of 6.5 years. The primary mutation, JAK2V617F, occurs in 40-60% of MF cases. Ruxolotinib, a JAK inhibitor, has been the mainstay in treating high risk, debilitating MF but largely clinical needs are unmet. Methods A comprehensive literature research was performed using PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, Web of Science and Clinicaltrials.gov. We included all trials that were under development in phase I/II/III trials. Our search identified 1642 full-length manuscripts or abstracts with published results in the last decade ( Jan 2007 till Dec 2017) were screened for relevant studies. After screening by 2 independent reviewers, 212 articles were finalized for our final analyses. We have reviewed the mechanism of action, safety and efficacy of 2 nd generation JAK inhibitors in this review. Results JAK1 inhibitor: Itacitinib reduced total symptom score (TSS) \u2265 50% in 15/42 (36%) patients. Mild gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances and some grade 3-4 myelosuppression (anemia: 33%, thrombocytopenia: 29%) were reported. JAK2 inhibitors: In PERSIST-1, pacritinib when compared to best available therapy (BAT) showed SVR \u2265 35% in 19.1% vs. 4.7% patients, with lower rates of myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia: 17%, anemia: 11%). In PERSIST-2, a phase III trial of pacritinb vs. BAT in patients with baseline cytopenias, similar efficacy was demonstrated (SVR \u2265 35%: 18% vs. 3%). Increasing rates of heart failure and intracranial hemorrhages led to a temporary hold which was lifted in August 2017. Lestaurtinib showed CI in 7 (44%) patients in a phase I trial (n=16) and 6 (27%) patients in a phase II trial (n=22). Most notable toxicities were G 1/2 GI disturbances, anemia occurred in 14% and thrombocytopenia in 23% of patients. In a phase III trial (n=193), fedratinib showed a SVR \u2265 35% and a TSS \u2265 50% in 40% and 36% patients, respectively. However, incidence of significant neurotoxicity and Wernicke's encephalopathy led to its suspension. Similarly, a trial of XL019 was terminated due to emergence of central and peripheral neurotoxicity. In a phase I trial (n=48), NS-018 exhibited a spleen length reduction (SLR) \u2265 50% in 20 (56%) patients along with prompt improvement in bone marrow fibrosis (37%). Anemia and thrombocytopenia were reported in 15% and 27% of patients, respectively. Dizziness (23%) and nausea (19%) were also reported. Gandotinib demonstrated SLR \u226550% in 62% patients, in a phase I trial (n=38). G1 diarrhea (55.3%) and nausea (42.1%) were the most common toxicities. JAK 1/2 inhibitors: SIMPLIFY-1 (S1), a phase III clinical trial (n=432) of momelotinib vs. ruxolotinib in JAK inhibitor-na\u00efve patients, demonstrated non-inferiority for momelotinib, in spleen volume reduction (SVR) \u2265 35% (26.5% vs. 29%; p=0.01). However, SIMPLIFY-2 trial (S2), that compared these two drugs in JAK inhibitor exposed patients did not achieve similar responses with momelotinib (6.7% vs. 5.8%; p=0.90). Interestingly, momelotinib excelled at achieving transfusion independency in both trials (S1: 66.5% vs. 49.3%; p=0.001, S2: 43.3% vs 21.2%; p=0.001). Grade \u2265 3 infections and peripheral neuropathy were the major toxicities noted. These trials were suspended after 89% of patients failed to achieve the primary endpoint of SVR. AZD1480 demonstrated clinical improvement (CI) in four (11%) patients in a phase I trial (n=35). Most common adverse events included grade (G) 1-2 dizziness and anemia. Conclusion Novel JAK pathway inhibitors have shown promising efficacy in MF but safety concerns regarding the hematological (cytopenias) and non-hematological adverse effects needs to be addressed until their use in clinical practice is established. Momelotinib success in achieving anemia related endpoints is note-worthy and should be further explored in this regard. A phase II study [NCT03165734] evaluating pacritinib monotherapy as a second line treatment in patients with baseline thrombocytopenia is ongoing.
