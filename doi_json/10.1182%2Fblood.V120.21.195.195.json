    "abstract_text": "Abstract 195 GEP analysis is a robust method to distinguish low- and high-risk multiple myeloma (MM), pertaining to 85% and 15% of newly diagnosed patients, respectively (Shaughnessy et al., Blood, 2007; 109:2276\u201384). As developed in TT2 and validated in TT3A and TT3B, we are now examining, similar to previous work in high-risk MM, whether we can define outliers among low-risk MM, i.e., patients not living up to the low-risk prediction model. Toward this end, we scrutinized early relapses in TT3A and TT3B within three years of protocol entry. Using logistic regression analysis, we identified baseline parameters including GEP, en route for distinguishing this high-risk subset among low-risk MM. Also examined was whether a new model could be built within low-risk disease that allowed for the identification of a high-risk subset. Our database was interrogated for patients known to have GEP-defined low-risk in the GEP-70 model. Table 1 summarizes the 3-year events among GEP-70 low-risk subjects per protocol. An optimal cut-point at +0.146 distinguished, among the combined TT2 and TT3 patients, inferior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) ( Figure 1 a). Next, we examined outcomes among all TT2 and TT3 patients with GEP data, including those with traditionally-defined high-risk (>=0.66). Here, we were able to distinguish three subgroups with distinctly different PFS and OS ( Figure 1 b). Utilizing logistic regression analysis, limited to traditionally-defined GEP-70 low-risk MM (=0.146 (HR=2.61, p=0.0005), the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities (CA) (HR=1.93, p=0.018), B2M >5.5mg/L (HR=1.95, p=0.04) and LDH >190U/L (HR=1.93, 0.02). These are all reported in Table 2 . In conclusion, we have identified, within GEP-70 low-risk patients, a new cut-point. This allows a better categorization of patients having truly low risk disease. Also, above which a prognosis intermediate to the traditional high-risk prognostic group (>=0.66) could be identified. GEP >0.146 dominated a multivariate logistic regression model. Further efforts will be presented on unique genes characterizing this intermediate risk group in relationship to low and high-risk subsets. Table 1.
