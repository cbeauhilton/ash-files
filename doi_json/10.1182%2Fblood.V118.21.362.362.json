    "abstract_text": "Abstract 362 Circulating platelets contain a high concentration of the multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) in their \u03b1-granules and release it as an inactive (latent) complex upon platelet adhesion and/or activation. We recently demonstrated that shear force can activate latent TGF-\u03b21 in vitro , and this mechanism may contribute to the activation of TGF-\u03b21 that we observed in vivo in the carotid arteries following injury and thrombus formation. TGF-\u03b21 is reported to be involved in the development of cardiac fibrosis in both humans and mouse models, but the cellular source(s) of TGF-\u03b21 and its activation mechanism in vivo have not been clearly established. To test the hypothesis that platelet TGF-\u03b21 contributes to cardiac fibrosis, we performed comparative studies of WT mice and gene-targeted animals with a megakaryocyte-specific deletion of TGF-\u03b21 [PF4-Cre/ Tgfb1 flox ( Tgfb1 flox )] using the transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model in male C57Bl/6 mice. Both groups also underwent sham surgery as controls. We obtained blood by percutaneous puncture of the LV under ultrasound guidance and plasma samples were prepared by immediate centrifugation at 12,000 g for 5 min. This technique consistently results in plasma TGF-\u03b21 levels in the range of \u223c1.0 ng/ml, which are below those previously reported by most investigators. Tgfb1 flox mice had 45% lower levels of plasma total TGF-\u03b21 than WT animals, with a median total TGF-\u03b21 level in WT of 1.37 ng/ml (IQR, interquartile range, 1.2\u20131.6; n=45) compared to 0.76 ng/ml (IQR 0.6\u20130.9; n=25)] in Tgfb1 flox mice (p<0.001 ). Heart weight/body weight ratios were 42% higher in TAC- (n=15) than in sham- (n=16) operated WT mice ( p<0.001 ) after 4 weeks, but only 11% higher in TAC- (n=13) than sham- (n=12) operated Tgfb1 flox mice ( p=0.02 ). The heart weight/body weight ratios correlated with total TGF-\u03b21 levels in WT mice undergoing both sham and TAC surgery (r=0.66; p<0.001 ), but not in Tgfb1 flox mice. Cardiac fibrosis was scored 4 weeks after surgery by an expert veterinary pathologist as 0 for no fibrosis, and 1+, 2+, or 3+ for mild, moderate, and severe fibrosis, respectively. 96% (22/23) of WT mice developed interstitial fibrosis after TAC, with 65% (15/23) developing mild and 30% (7/23) developing moderate (6/23) or severe (1/23) fibrosis. In contrast, only 54% (7/13) of Tgfb1 flox mice developed interstitial fibrosis, with 31% (4/13) developing mild and 15% (2/13) developing moderate fibrosis; none developed severe fibrosis ( p<0.01 ). The Tgfb1 flox mice also had significantly less perivascular fibrosis than did the WT mice, although the differences were less evident ( p=0.03 ). Cardiac function measured by echocardiography one week after TAC surgery demonstrated that Tgfb1 flox mice had better systolic function than WT mice ( Table ).

Data are reported as median [IQR] \u2020Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test. Presurgery values for EF, SV, and FS were similar in WT and Tgfb1 flox mice View Large We conclude that platelet TGF-\u03b21 contributes to the development of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and systolic dysfunction induced by a high shear, TAC model. These data have important implications for understanding TGF-\u03b21 biology and assessing the role of TGF-\u03b21 in murine models of human diseases. Since shear can dramatically activate TGF-\u03b21 in vitro , it is possible that increased shear force in the TAC mice generates active TGF-\u03b21, which may contribute to the development of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and systolic dysfunction.
