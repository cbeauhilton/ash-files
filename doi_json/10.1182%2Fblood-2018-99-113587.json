    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The full primary analysis of the international, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized controlled phase 3 study (20090482) that assessed the efficacy and safety of denosumab vs zoledronic acid for preventing skeletal-related events (SREs) in newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma (NDMM) met the primary noninferiority endpoint of time to first on-study SRE (Raje N, et al. Lancet Oncol . 2018). Overall survival, a secondary endpoint, was similar in both arms; however, this result was based on a limited number of events having occurred (denosumab 14.1% vs zoledronic acid 15.0%), which might have affected the ability to detect a difference and also may have been further diluted by multiple subsequent lines of therapy. In addition, results from an exploratory endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS), demonstrated a clinically meaningful 10.7 months median PFS benefit (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-0.99; descriptive P =0.036; Table 1 ) of denosumab versus zoledronic acid on top of standard of care first-line anti-myeloma treatment. This result provided suggestive clinical evidence of a potential anti-myeloma effect based on RANKL inhibition. Here we present further analysis of PFS according to prespecified subgroups of patients from the 20090482 study. Methods: Adult NDMM patients with \u22651 documented lytic bone lesion were included in this study. Patients received subcutaneous denosumab (120 mg) plus intravenous placebo or intravenous zoledronic acid (4 mg) plus subcutaneous placebo every 4 weeks. Both groups also received investigators' choice of first-line anti-myeloma therapy. The exploratory endpoint PFS (time from randomization to date of first overall disease progression or death due to any cause, investigator identified) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by randomization stratification factors and adjusted for baseline covariates. PFS subgroup analyses were conducted according to the novel first-line therapy use (proteasome inhibitor [PI] use, immunomodulatory drug [IMiD] use, PI and IMiD use) and the intent to receive an autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT; yes, no). Results: Overall, 1718 patients (denosumab, n=859; zoledronic acid, n=859) were included in the primary analysis. By the time of the primary analysis cut-off, 219 patients (25.5%) in the denosumab group and 260 patients (30.3%) in the zoledronic acid group had a PFS event. The percentages of patients receiving novel first-line therapy were balanced between the two groups (see Table 1 ). For patients who had received first-line PI-based therapy, PFS favored denosumab vs zoledronic acid (median, 40.0 vs 35.4 months; HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58-0.95; descriptive P =0.019; Table 1 ). For patients who had received first-line IMiD only-based therapy, median PFS was not reached with denosumab therapy and was 34.3 months with zoledronic acid therapy (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.53-1.35; descriptive P =0.49). Median PFS was also not reached for either denosumab or zoledronic acid for patients who had received first-line PI plus IMiD therapy (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.62-1.46; descriptive P =0.82). For patients with the intent at baseline to receive an ASCT (54% in each treatment group; Table 1 ), PFS favored denosumab vs zoledronic acid (median, 46.1 vs 35.7 months; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.49-0.85; descriptive P =0.002). Conclusion: Overall results from this subanalysis indicated PFS impact and benefit of denosumab on top of anti-myeloma therapy, independent from first-line novel therapy which was balanced among treatment arms, mainly in the subgroup of patients receiving PI only-based first-line therapy. In addition, benefit was observed in patients with the intent to receive ASCT, described with an impressive HR of 0.65.
