    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2047 Anemia is both a highly prevalent and clinically important condition that causes significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly population. While anemia in the elderly can be attributed to a number of causes, approximately 30% of elderly subjects with anemia have no overt etiology and fall under the category of unexplained anemia of the elderly (UA). There is increasing evidence to suggest that changes in the frequency and/or function of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells may contribute to the onset and pathophysiology of age-associated hematological conditions, such as UA. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) reside at the top of the hematopoietic hierarchy and can differentiate, via increasingly committed downstream progenitors, into all the mature cells of the hematopoietic system. Human myelo-erythroid development proceeds through a set of oligopotent progenitors: HSC give rise to multipotent progenitors (MPP), which give rise to common myeloid progenitors (CMP), which in turn give rise to granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP) and megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEP). We use flow cytometry and in vitro culture of sorted human HSC (Lin-CD34+CD38-CD90+CD45RA-), MPP (Lin-CD34+CD38-CD90-CD45RA-), CMP (Lin-CD34+CD38+CD123+CD45RA-), GMP (Lin-CD34+CD38+CD123+CD45RA+), and MEP (Lin-CD34+CD38+CD123-CD45RA-) from hematologically normal young (23 samples; age 20\u201335) and elderly (11 samples; age 65+) and UA (5 samples; age 65+) bone marrow samples in order to characterize the changes in the distribution and function of hematopoietic stem and progenitor populations during the aging process and, in particular, in the development of UA. We found that UA patients contain higher frequencies of HSC compared to both elderly normal (1.5-fold; p<0.03) and young normal samples (2.8-fold; p<10 -5 ). We also found increased frequencies of MPP from UA patients compared to MPP from elderly normal (2.6-fold; p<0.002) and young normal samples (5.8-fold; p<0.04). While we observed similar frequencies of CMP among the three groups, we found a notable trend suggesting decreased frequencies of GMP and corresponding increased frequencies of MEP in UA patients. Functionally, HSC from the three groups exhibit statistically insignificant differences in the efficiency of colony formation under the myeloid differentiation-promoting methylcellulose-based in vitro culture conditions; however, on average, HSC from elderly bone marrow samples, regardless of the presence or absence of anemia, tend to form fewer colonies in methylcellulose. Interestingly, HSC from UA patients produce more granulocyte-monocyte (CFU-GM) colonies and fewer erythroid (CFU-E and BFU-E) colonies, compared to HSC from normal samples (p<0.001). Similarly, CMP from UA patients, compared to normal CMP, yield skewed distributions of myeloid-erythroid colonies when plated in methylcellulose, significantly favoring production of CFU-GM colonies over CFU-E and BFU-E colonies (p<0.003). Additionally, MEP from UA patients form both CFU-E and BFU-E colonies in methylcellulose albeit at a significantly lower efficiency than MEP from normal bone marrow samples (p<0.01). This is the first study to examine the changes in hematopoietic stem and progenitor populations in UA patients. The changes in the distribution of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in UA patients indicate that the HSC and MPP populations, and possibly also the MEP population, expand in the context of anemia, potentially in response to homeostatic feedback mechanisms. Nevertheless, these expanded populations are functionally impaired in their ability to differentiate towards the erythroid lineage. Our data suggest that there are intrinsic defects in the HSC population of UA patients that lead to poor erythroid differentiation, which can be readily observed even in the earliest committed myelo-erythroid progenitors. We have generated gene expression profiling data from these purified hematopoietic stem and progenitor populations from UA patients to try to identify biological pathways and markers relevant to disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.
