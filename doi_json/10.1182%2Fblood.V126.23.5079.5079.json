    "abstract_text": "Background: FL is one of the most frequent types of lymphomas: it consists about 22% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas in Russia. 20 % of pts have an aggressive tumor after standard therapy. In FL pts with unfavorable prognosis (FLIPI-1 III-IV, fast growth of tumor mass, B-symptoms, third cytological grade of tumor, bulky, absence of tumor response after first line R-CHOP-21 therapy) autoSCT allows to increase the overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Aim: To estimate an efficacy of HDT (high dose therapy) with following autoSCT in front-line therapy of FL pts with factors of poor prognosis. Patients and Methods: Since 2000 to 2015 years in National Research Center for Hematology were treated 39 FL pts with poor prognosis. All pts received R-CHOP-21 induction therapy. In 24 patients (62%) who hadn't partial response or poor prognosis patients with partial response after 4-6 courses autoSCT was performed. This group consists of 17 males and 7 females with median age 46 years old (31-68). Majority of pts (23/24) had IV stage of disease according to Ann Arbor. In 16/24 (66%) cases pts had bulky disease. 3/24 pts had phenomenon of leukaemization. Basing on FLIPI-1 criteria all pts were divided into 3 groups: low risk - 5/24, intermediate - 3/24, high - 16/24. B-symptoms were in majority of cases (18/24). 18/24 pts were diagnosed with I-II cytological grade of FL, 6/24 - III A/B. Basing on tumor growth pattern there was following ratio: nodular tumor growth revealed in 6/24 pts, nodular-diffuse tumor growth - in 15/24, diffuse tumor growth - in 3/24. Immunochemical analysis of serum and urine proteins was performed in 20/24 cases, among them increased level of serum \u03b22-microglobulin was diagnosed in 10/20 pts. Increased activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was revealed in 16/24 pts. Bone marrow involvement at the time of disease onset was diagnosed in 18/24 pts. Results: After induction R-CHOP-21 chemotherapy pts underwent HDT which included two courses R-DHAP, following high-dose cyclophosphamide with rituximab, then high dose etoposide with rituximab. As condition regimen R-BEAM was performed. All 24 FL pts, who underwent autoSCT, continue to be in complete remission. Median follow-up was 31 months (7-178). Conclusions: Preliminary results of the first prospective study of intensive therapy of FL in Russia demonstrate that autoSCT in front line therapy provides to achieve a complete remission in pts with poor prognosis and allows to increase an overall and disease-free survival.
