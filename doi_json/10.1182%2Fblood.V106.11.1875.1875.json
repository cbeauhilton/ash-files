    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Bleeding risk accompanied with anti-platelet drugs is an ultimate dilemma in the treatment of thrombosis patient. Under high shear condition of blood flow, vWF- and collagen-induced signaling pathways are likely to trigger the platelet adhesion to the injured endothelium, which leads to the activation of platelets and arterial thrombus formation. Thus, the recent studies suggest that the selective inhibitor of these pathways is a new target of anti-platelet drugs with lower bleeding risk. We report here a pharmacological profile of DZ-697b, which selectively inhibits platelet aggregation evoked by ristocetin and collagen in vitro and ex vivo . Materials and methods: Human volunteers blood was processed platelet rich plasma (PRP) or washed platelets. PRP aggregation was induced by ristocetin and collagen. To reveal the selectivity, effect of DZ-697b on U46619 (TXA 2 analogue), ADP, thrombin and TRAP induced aggregation in the washed platelets were examined. In guinea pigs and cynomolgus monkeys, effects of DZ-697b given orally were also examined on ex vivo PRP aggregation induced by collagen. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of DZ-697b, changes in phosphorylation of FcR \u03b3 chain, a common signaling pathway of both vWF- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation, were studied. Results: DZ-697b potently inhibited both ristocetin- and collagen-induced human PRP aggregation, the IC50 being 0.74 \u03bcM and 0.55 \u03bcM, respectively. In contrast, DZ-697b even at 50 \u03bcM did not show any influences on U46619, ADP, thrombin and TRAP induced platelet aggregation. DZ-697b did not affect ovine COX-1 and COX-2 activities at up to 300 \u03bcM. The bioavailability of this compound was more than 80% in monkeys. Oral administration of DZ-697b at 1\u20133 mg/kg significantly and persistently inhibited collagen induced PRP aggregation in monkeys and guinea pigs. Application of ristocetin, vWF, and collagen significantly increased the intensity of phosphorylation of FcR \u03b3 chain in washed platelets, which were inhibited by DZ-697b. Conclusion: DZ-697b is an orally active compound which selectively inhibits ristocetin- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation and seems to be promising as novel anti-platelet drug.",
