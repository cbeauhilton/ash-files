    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4798 Blinatumomab is a single-chain bispecific antibody construct with specificity for CD19 and CD3 belonging to the class of bispecific T cell engager (BiTE\u00ae). It has shown high response rates as single agent after treatment of patients with indolent and mantle cell lymphoma and B-precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia. We here report from an ongoing phase 1 trial in non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients on transient laboratory findings seen upon start of continuous i.v. infusion of blinatumomab. The vast majority of adverse events (AEs) during 4-8 weeks of infusion occurred within the first two days of treatment. Lymphopenia (up to CTCAE grade 4) was the most frequent early laboratory AE, and can be explained by rapid B cell depletion and initial redistribution of T cells. Except for B cell decline, all laboratory parameters were transient and normalized within days during continued treatment. Dose-dependent increases were seen for AST and ALT (maximally grade 1/2), CRP, and D-dimer during the first days of treatment. Dose-dependent declines during the first days of treatment were observed for platelets and hemoglobin, which normalized after a few days. Of note, no drug-related thromboembolic events were observed. Serum levels of cytokines IL-6, IL-2, IFN\u03b3, and IL-10 showed small dose-dependent increases, which reversed to baseline within hours. No association between cytokine levels and thrombocytopenia was found. Moreover, there was no evident correlation between any laboratory abnormality and clinical adverse event observed during the first days of treatment. The laboratory AEs induced by blinatumomab appear to reflect consequences of the onset of redirected target cell lysis, T cell activation and bystander effects. In conclusion, blinatumomab causes characteristic laboratory findings during the first days of treatment, which are transient, not associated with clinically relevant AEs and do not require treatment interruption. Compared to AEs caused by chemotherapy regimens, the laboratory findings observed after start of blinatumomab treatment are considered rather mild.
