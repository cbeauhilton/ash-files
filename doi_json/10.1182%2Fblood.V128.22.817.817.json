    "abstract_text": "Blood transfusion is widely used for various clinical therapies. Ex vivo production of red blood cells (RBCs) in a large-scale from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has been considered as a potential way to overcome the shortage of blood supply. Here, we report that functional human RBCs can be efficiently produced by using a bottle-turning device culture system from cord blood (CB) CD34 + cells. A procedure of four-stage ex vivo expansion and differentiation was developed in a modified IMDM basal medium supplemented with transferrin, insulin, folic acid, fetal bovine serum, and some other nutrients with selected cytokine combinations that contained stem cell factor (SCF), Flt-3 ligand (FL), and thrombopoietin (TPO) in stage I (days 0~5); SCF, FL, erythropoietin(EPO), interleukin 3 (IL-3), and GM-CSF in stage II (days 6~12); SCF, FL, IL-3, and EPO in stage III (days 13~18); SCF and EPO in stage IV (days 19~21). Enriched CD34 + cells were firstly cultured and expanded in 25-T flasks. After 5 day-culture, the cells were transferred to a 2-L bottle with 600 ml of medium in the bottle-turning device system. During the differentiation process, erythroid markers (CD71 and CD235a) and enucleation efficiency (LDS- percentage) of cultured cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. Erythroid progenitor cells were confirmed by clonogenic capacity by colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. Hemoglobin (HGB) content of the cells were determined quantitatively, and RT-qPCR analysis was performed to examine the expression of erythroid-specific genes and the status of proto-oncogenes. Furthermore, generated RBCs were CFSE-labeled and injected into irradiated NOD/SCID mice to monitor the viability and maturation in vivo . For stage I, the proliferation folds of CD34 + cells reached 20 \u00b1 2.4 while CD34 + rate was maintained at 80% \u00b1 4.3%. Subsequently, CFU assay on Day9 and Day12 showed that over 90% of the total colonies were erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) or erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E), suggesting that these expanded cells were induced toward the erythroid lineage. For 21-day induction, approximate 2\u00d710 8 erythrocytes were produced from one CD34 + cell with a purity of CD235a + and CD71 + cells at 90% \u00b1 6.2% and 54 % \u00b1 7.2%, respectively. Furthermore, the results from flow cytometry of LDS-stained cells showed that 50% \u00b1 5.7% of induced erythrocytes were enucleated. At various time points of the cell culture process, RT-qPCR analysis showed that expressions of erythroid-specific genes were normal and the proto-oncogenes (c-myc, c-myb, Bmi-1, k-ras, cyclinB, and HETRT) were not activated. From days 9 to 21, HGB contents of the cultured cells increased from 12.3 \u00b1 1.5 pg/cell to 31.5 \u00b1 2.4 pg/cell, which was similar to the contents of normal human RBCs (range: 27 - 33 pg/cell). In addition, the induced RBCs, after storing at 4\u2103 for more than 4 weeks, had normal HGB content, and showed normal expression of both CD235a and CD71. In mouse studies, the CD71 + marker on the 21-day cultured cells was diminished or undetectable in CFSE + cells 3-day after transplantation. In contrast, LDS - cells among the CFSE + population increased to 97.1% \u00b1 2.3% 3-day post injection, indicating that the 21-day cultured RBCs could be further enucleated and matured in vivo . Taken together, we have established a pilot-scale culture system to produce functional human RBCs ex vivo . Considering that one blood transfusion unit contains 0.8\u00d710 12 RBCs, the CD34 + cells from one CB unit (80 ml with 2\u00d710 6 CD34 + cells) would generate 4\u00d710 14 RBCs, which are equivalent to 500 blood transfusion units in the clinical application.
