    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5311 Dysregulation of angiogenesis is implicated in many diseases. Von Willebrand factor (VWF), a large plasma glycoprotein essential for normal haemostasis is synthesized by endothelial cells (EC) and megakaryocytes. Raised VWF plasma levels are a risk factor for arterial thrombosis, whilst deficiency of VWF causes Von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common congenital bleeding disorder in man. VWD can be associated with angiodysplasia, vascular malformations linked to defective angiogenesis which are responsible for intractable bleeding. We recently showed that VWF is involved in angiogenesis. Inhibition of VWF expression in human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) with specific siRNA resulted in increased in vitro angiogenesis on Matrigel, proliferation and migration. Mechanism studies implicated the endothelial VWF receptor, integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and the angiogenesis regulator angiopoietin-2. The findings were confirmed in EC from VWD patients and in VWF-deficient mice. Blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC) isolated from peripheral blood of patients with VWD showed decreased VWF release, compared to control BOEC, and increased in vitro angiogenesis, migration and proliferation, similar to what observed with VWF siRNA-treated HUVEC. In vivo studies using the matrigel model and imaging of blood vessels in the ear showed increased angiogenesis and vascular network in VWF-deficient mice compared to controls. Recent studies in patients BOEC and in VWF deficient mice provide new insight into the complexity of this phenotype. We have used the mouse model of post-natal angiogenesis in the retina to carry out detailed analysis of angiogenic networks in the VWF-deficient mouse, and found increased vascular density and defective vascular network. Moreover, using BOEC from patients with type I and type II VWD, we have studied VWF intracellular distribution by immunofluorescence confocal analysis and found patterns of expression that point to a variety of defects in synthesis, storage and secretion. These studies define a new function for VWF, which may have clinical implications for VWD and for patients at risk of CV disease. Moreover, studies with BOEC from VWF patients provide a novel understanding of the physiopathology of this disease. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
