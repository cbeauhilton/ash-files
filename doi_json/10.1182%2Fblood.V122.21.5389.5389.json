    "abstract_text": "CS1 is an ideal target for multiple myeloma (MM) therapy as it is highly expressed on MM while having a very limited expression profile in normal tissues.\u00a0 Elotuzumab (elo), a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting CS1, has an acceptable safety profile and clinical activity in relapsed/refractory MM when combined with the immune modulator lenalidomide (len) and low dose dexamethasone (dex).\u00a0 The primary mechanism of action for elo is NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.\u00a0 Here we report on a patient who was given elo/len via a single patient IND 6 months after receiving therapy with ex vivo activated auto-ENK cells and low dose IL2 as previously described (Szmania et al, Blood ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts 2012;120:1912). \u00a0The patient had relapsing GEP70 high-risk MM with cytogenetic abnormalities and had failed multiple lines of prior therapy including 3 auto-PBSC transplants and further salvage treatments including len, bortezomib, pomalidomide and carfilzomib.\u00a0 \u00a0Although ENK cell therapy did not induce a response, subsequent disease progression was slow.\u00a0 IV elo was started 187 days after ENK cell infusion, and given every 14 days at the currently studied dose of 10mg/kg. \u00a0Len at 15mg/day was given on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle. \u00a0Dex premedication (p.o. 38mg; IV, 10mg) was added after a grade 2 infusion reaction was observed to elo dose #1. While on the ENK cell protocol this patient had a dramatic increase in circulating NK cell counts peaking 9 days after infusion (6300 NK/\u00b5L, a 48-fold increase from baseline). Although still in the high range, NK cell levels at the time of elo treatment had normalized somewhat (539 NK/ml), and the cell surface expression of key activating receptors was consistent with a resting phenotype.\u00a0 NK cell count remained stable after the first dose of elo (530 NK/ml) but subsequently dipped to 179 NK/\u00b5L after elo dose #2.\u00a0\u00a0 Since dex has been reported to affect NK cell counts, it is important to note that an additional dose was taken prior to elo dose #2 due to a travel delay (in total 66 mg of dex was taken on this occasion).\u00a0 Circulating NK cells (collected pre-elo and 11, 25, and 57 days after elo dose #1) had similar low activity against auto-MM collected prior to elo treatment (effector:target ratio 10:1, 0-5% specific lysis) and killing against MM collected after 5 elo doses was only modestly increased (3-12%).\u00a0 However, the same circulating NK cells exhibited significantly increased cytolytic ability when additional elo (10\u00b5g/mL) was added during the in vitro E:T co-incubation (3-11 fold increase in killing over isotype control, p=0.0008) suggesting that the MM targets were not saturated with mAb. Bound mAb may have been reduced in part during target cell isolation and freeze/thaw.\u00a0 Freshly prepared auto-ENK cells exhibited an activated immunophenotype and induced significantly higher killing of pre-elo MM (45%) compared to non-expanded NK.\u00a0 ENK killing was higher still against MM collected after 5 doses of elo (61%).\u00a0 When elo was present during the assay, ENK demonstrated the most effective killing of auto-MM, reaching levels\u00a0 equivalent to that of the NK sensitive target K562 (85% vs. 82% lysis).\u00a0 Successful mAb therapy for MM is now moving forward as target antigens with selective, high and homogeneous expression, such as CS1, are identified.\u00a0 However, the activity of responding effector cells is a critical issue to consider.\u00a0 Inadequate NK cell count and activity level has been reported in MM and steroids typically given to debulk and preempt mAb-induced infusion reactions may exacerbate this problem.\u00a0 Immunomodulatory agents given to enhance immune cell activity are not sufficient to reverse the negative effect of steroids.\u00a0 We have previously shown that large doses of highly activated auto-ENK cells can be safely infused and that these cells expand further after infusion.\u00a0 In this study we show that ENK cells have significant activity in vitro against auto-MM and that elo further enhances this activity.\u00a0 Combination therapy incorporating saturating doses of mAb followed by infusion of NK effector cells with optimized activity against auto-MM is an innovative approach that warrants investigation.\u00a0 Infusing highly activated effector cells after dex/elo may be one way to reap the benefits of combining these modalities while circumventing steroid-induced immune suppression.
