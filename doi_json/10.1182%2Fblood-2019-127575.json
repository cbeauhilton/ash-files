    "abstract_text": "Introduction:Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors are highly active in relapsed and refractory (RR) classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), however their role as part of second-line therapy (SLT) for cHL is largely unexplored. The standard approach following front-line treatment failure is SLT, aimed to achieve complete response (CR), followed by consolidation with high dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant (HDT/ASCT). There is no one standard SLT and options include platinum-containing regimens, gemcitabine-containing regimens and more recently brentuximab vedotin (BV)-containing regimens. Due to the increasing use of BV in the front-line setting, development of SLT regimens that are both highly effective and BV-sparing are needed. In this phase II study, we aimed to establish the safety and efficacy of SLT with the PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab, combined with the outpatient-administered salvage regimen, GVD (gemcitabine, vinorelbine, liposomal doxorubicin). Methods: Transplant eligible patients (pts) with RR cHL following failure of 1-line of therapy are eligible. Treatment consists of 2 to 4 cycles of pembrolizumab (200mg IV, day 1), gemcitabine (1000mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8), vinorelbine (20mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8) and liposomal doxorubicin (15mg/m2, days 1 and 8), given on 21-day cycles. Response is assessed by PET after 2 and 4 cycles. Pts who achieve CR by PET (Deauville \u22643) after 2 or 4 cycles proceed to HDT/ASCT. An initial safety assessment for the first 6 treated pts was completed before continuing further enrollment. We report here the results of the safety assessment and the first stage of a Simon 2-stage design. Results:To date, 18 out of a planned 39 pts enrolled; 14 completed the first 2 cycles of treatment and underwent the first response assessment. Characteristics for the 14 evaluable pts are shown in the table. In brief, median age is 36 (range 21-43), 4 (29%) have primary refractory disease and 9 (64%) relapsed within the first year of initial treatment. No dose limiting toxicities were observed during the safety assessment and no significant adverse events were observed to date. Of the 30 cycles administered, 5 (17%) cycles were delayed due to treatment related adverse events which included grade 3 rash (3%) and grade 3 liver function test abnormalities (13%). Among the 14 evaluable pts, 13 (93%) achieved CR after 2 cycles of treatment and 1 achieved partial response. To date, 3 pts are proceeding to HDT/ASCT and 11 pts completed HDT/ASCT following 2 (n=10) or 4 (n=1) cycles of treatment. Median follow-up post HDT/ASCT is 4 mos (range 0.3-8.8 mos) and all pts remain in remission to date. Conclusion:Early trial results suggest that pembrolizumab-GVD is a highly effective and well-tolerated regimen that can efficiently bridge pts with RR cHL to HDT/ASCT. Efficacy criteria for stage one of the Simon 2-stage design was met and enrollment continues to better characterize CR rate and tolerability.
