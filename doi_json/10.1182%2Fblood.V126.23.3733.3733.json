    "abstract_text": "Objective: The present study was conducted to investigate the impact of breastfeeding on the risk of development of acute leukemia among children Admitted to Alexandria University Children's Hospital. METHODS: A case control study included 134 ALL&AML cases & 134 matched controls for age & sex from the same family relatives to evaluate socioeconomic & genetic causes of the disease. The mothers were interviewed for the completion of interview format that included: duration & patterns of breastfeeding. RESULTS: lower proportion of acute leukemia cases 59.7% were exclusively breast-fed babies as compared to 89.6% of the control subjects. However, higher proportions of index children were either predominant breast-fed 19.4% or complementary-fed 10.4%. Nearly 10.4% were bottle-fed babies as compared to none of their controls. The differences between cases & controls as regards pattern of breast feeding were statistically significant where p<0.001. As regards duration of breastfeeding 75.4% of index children were breast-fed for more than 6 months as compared to vast majority of their controls (97.8%). The difference between cases & controls was statistically significant where p <0.001. The association also was statistically significant when 2 groups (standard & high risk) were considered as regards pattern of breastfeeding where x 2 =13.055, p =0.004. The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that bottle feeding had the odds of 7.76 of being at high risk level for acute leukemia (OR=7.76, 95% CI 1.9-33.8). CONCLUSION: Exclusive breast-feeding and breast-feeding for one year are protective against acute childhood leukemia. Table 1.
