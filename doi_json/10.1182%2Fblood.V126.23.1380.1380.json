    "abstract_text": "Background Several molecular markers, such as FLT3- internal tandem duplication (ITD), NPM1 , CEBPA are well known to correlate with mortality in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently, a number of gene mutations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AML, including mutations of DNMT3A , IDH1/2 , TET2 and EZH2 in addition to RAS , KIT and FLT3 . However, DNMT3A , IDH1/2 , and TET2 are rare in pediatric patients with AML, thus accurate risk evaluation remained challenging even after incorporating these molecular markers. On the other hand, overexpression of the EVI1 gene is reported to be associated with adverse outcome in pediatric AML. Moreover, we have previously reported that measuring of PRDM16 gene expression was a powerful tool to predict the prognosis of pediatric AML. PRDM16 gene is highly homologous to the MDS1/EVI1 gene, which is an alternatively spliced transcript of the EVI1 gene. In this study, we investigated EVI1 gene expression to verify the prognosis of EVI1 gene expression and the relationship between EVI1 and PRDM16 gene expression. Methods Between 2006 and 2010, 485 de novo pediatric AML patients participated in the Japanese AML-05 study conducted by the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG). Among them, 116 patients were excluded from the study because of misdiagnosis and unavailability of their RNA samples. Therefore, 369 patients were analyzed. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed in these patients using the 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR System with TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix and TaqMan Gene Expression Assay. In addition to EVI1 and PRDM16 , ABL1 was also evaluated as a control gene. We investigated the correlations between these gene expressions and other genetic alterations, and clarified the prognostic impact of EVI1 and association between EVI1 and PRDM16 genes. Results A total of 58 of 369 patients (15.7%) showed high expression of EVI1 gene. Overexpression of EVI1 gene was strongly associated with dismal prognosis; low risk (LR; 1 of 123 patients, or 0.8%); intermediate risk (IR; 38 of 147 patients, or 25.9%); high risk (HR; 6 of 50 patients, or 12%); and non-complete remission (Non-CR; 13 of 49 patients, or 26.5%), ( P < 0.001). Overexpression of EVI1 correlated with the following characteristics: younger age at diagnosis; M4, M5, and M7 subtype; higher coincidence of MLL -rearrangement; and lower coincidence of t(8;21), and inv(16). EVI1 overexpression was very frequent among patients with de novo pediatric AML and IR/non-CR groups. Furthermore, more than half of patients in M6 (5 of 8 patients, or 62.5%) were EVI1 high expression. Interestingly, no patients with EVI1 high expression in M7 had a fusion of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 . Patients with EVI1 overexpression also more frequently harbored a complex karyotype and monosomy 7. The frequencies of patients with high or low EVI1 expression differed widely with respect to each genetic alteration, as follows: t(8;21), 1% vs 99%, P < 0.001; inv(16), 0% vs 100%, P < 0.001; NUP98 - JARID1A , 83% vs 17%, P < 0.001; OTT-MAL , 100% vs 0%, P = 0.02; and KIT , 5% vs 95%, P = 0.003. The overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) among patients with EVI1 high expressions were significantly lower than that among patients without such gene aberrant expression (3-year OS 54% vs. 77%, P=0.008G3-year EFS: 34% vs 58%, P<0.001), respectively. On the other hand, a total of 84 of 369 patients (22.8%) showed high expression of PRDM16 gene. The OS and EFS among PRDM16 overexpressing patients were significantly worse than those among low expression group (3-year OS: 51% vs 81%, P<0.001; 3-year EFS: 32% vs 64%, P<0.001), respectively. Remarkably, concerning 125 patients with high EVI1 and/or PRDM16 expression, their prognosis was much worse than that of patients without these high expression (3-year OS: 54% vs 84%, P<0.001; 3-year EFS: 32% vs 68%, P<0.001) , respectively. Conclusions We investigated EVI1 and PRDM16 gene expression in de novo pediatric AML patients, and their high expression was associated with inferior survival, respectively. We suggest that high EVI1 and/or PRDM16 expression is useful marker for adverse outcome. On the other hand, low EVI1 and PRDM16 expressions are useful to elucidate low risk patients.
