    "abstract_text": "Abstract 358 FN2 Dendritic cells (DCs) are important regulators of the human immune response. By means of direct intercellular interactions and secretion of cytokines, they can induce a stimulatory or a regulatory response, depending on the environment in which they developed. In vitro , it is possible to imitate this process by addition of various cytokines. The aim of this study was to evaluate DCs matured by different cytokine cocktails for expression of immunostimulatory and -inhibitory molecules and correspondent activation of T helper 1 (Th1) and natural killer (NK) cells. The selection of these cocktails was guided by potential clinical application and usage in a GMP setting. We compared three different ways of DC generation from peripheral blood monocytes of healthy donors: 1) maturation by a cocktail including the TLR7/8 agonist R848 (TLR-mDCs), 2) DC generation by the standard combination of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-4, GM-CSF, IL-1\u03b2, PGE 2 , TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6) applied in many clinical studies so far (cc-mDCs), and 3) addition of IL-10 in order to induce a more regulatory phenotype (IL10-mDCs). The expression of a broad range of costimulatory and coinhibitory molecules (CD80, CD86, CD273, CD274, CD275, CD276, B7-H4, HVEM, CD30L, CD70, CD134L = OX40L, CD137L = 4-1BBL) on the surface of these DC populations was analyzed by FACS. Secretion of various cytokines crucial for interaction with other immune cells (IL-12p70, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and TGF-\u03b2) was measured by cytometric bead array after stimulation with CD40 ligand. In order to assess the functional importance of these signals, we performed in vitro polarization assays for T helper cells after co-culture with DCs and measured the in vitro stimulatory potential of the DCs for natural killer (NK) cells by CD69 upregulation and intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining. We could show that TLR-mDCs were characterized by a predominance of costimulatory (e.g. CD80, CD86) relative to coinhibitory molecules (e.g. CD273, CD274, HVEM). When stimulated by CD40L, they displayed a cytokine profile with very high IL-12p70 and TNF-\u03b1, but little if any IL-10 production. In a co-culture with autologous T cells, the combination of these signals resulted in a strong polarization toward IFN-\u03b3 secreting Th1 cells, with little or no stimulation of Th2 and Th17 cells. The costimulatory profile of cc-mDCs, in comparison, was shifted toward a lower expression of costimulatory molecules and similar or higher expression of coinhibitory molecules (ratio of CD86 to CD273 expression around 40 compared to > 60 for TLR-mDCs, p < 0.005). No IL-12p70 and low levels of IL-10 were secreted. These signals were reflected in a less pronounced type 1 polarization of T helper cells. IL10-mDCs expressed very low levels of CD80 and CD86 and displayed a coinhibitory molecule pattern similar to cc-mDCs. Additionally, they secreted the immunoregulatory molecule IL-10 in higher amounts and did not activate T helper cells at all. As IL-12p70 is an important factor for NK cell activation, only TLR-mDCs were capable of upregulating the activation marker CD69 on NK cells and inducing significant secretion of IFN-\u03b3. Both Th1 and NK cells play an important role in tumor defense. With this set of data, we clearly showed that TLR-mDCs, in consequence of their positive costimulatory profile and their high IL-12p70 secretion, are superior with respect to type 1 polarization of T cells and activation of NK cells. They are therefore highly suitable for application in cancer immunotherapy. This DC type will be used in a phase I/II trial for postremission therapy in patients with non-favorable AML, which will start in our clinic in 2012.
