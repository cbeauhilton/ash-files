    "abstract_text": "We have recently demonstrated that Pax5 promotes B-lymphomagenesis by upregulating key components of B-cell receptor signaling [Cozma et al, J Clin Inv, 117 (8), 2007]. Gene regulation by Pax5 often involves complex formation with other oncogenic transcription factors of the Ets family, namely Myb and Ets1. We determined that expression of these proteins themselves depends on the presence of Pax5, as seen in human diffuse large B-cell lymphomas with Pax5 knockdown and murine lymphomas with epigenetic silencing of Pax5 [ Yu et al, Blood , 101 : 1950 \u20131955, 2003 ; Johnson et al, Nat Immunol , 5 : 853 \u2013861, 2004 ]. Upon reconstitution with the Pax5 gene, Myb and Ets1 levels increase sharply. This occurs with little increase in steady-state mRNA levels, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation, possibly by microRNAs. To test this hypothesis, we compared miRNA profiles of Pax5-deficieint and sufficient cells and discovered that several miRNAs are indeed repressed by Pax5. Among them is the miR-15a/16-1 cluster whose predicted targets include both Myb and Ets1. Consistent with this prediction, forced expression of miR-15a/16 brings down Myb and Ets1 protein levels. This is accompanied by impaired Pax5 function and overall suppression of B-lymphomagenesis. Thus, Ets family members (along with previously identified bcl-2) are key targets of the miR-15a/16 locus, a tumor suppressor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
