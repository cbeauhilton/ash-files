    "abstract_text": "Background: Overall survival (OS) in older patients (pts) with AML and poor-risk cytogenetics is only ~2-3 months (mos) (Burnett, Cancer , 2007). Often these pts receive only palliative treatment (Tx) with best supportive care (BSC). Low-dose Ara-C (LDAC) provides no OS benefit in pts with poor cytogenetics (D\u00f6hner, Blood , 2010). Typically, intensive chemotherapy (IC) is either not suitable for older AML pts with poor cytogenetics or, when it is used, provides no OS benefit (Kantarjian, Blood , 2010). The phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label AZA-AML-001 trial showed azacitidine (AZA) Tx in older pts with newly diagnosed AML (>30% bone marrow [BM] blasts) prolonged median OS by ~4 mos vs conventional care regimens (CCR) (10.4 vs 6.5 mos; p=0.1009) and improved 1-year survival (46.5% vs 34.2%) (Dombret, EHA , 2014). Cytogenetic risk is a prognostic indicator in elderly AML and a frequent determinant of Tx approach and outcomes. Objective: To determine the effect of Tx with AZA vs CCR on OS and 1-year survival in AZA-AML-001 pt subgroups based on cytogenetic risk classification. Methods: Pts aged \u226565 years with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary AML who were ineligible for transplant, with intermediate- or poor-risk cytogenetics (pts with favorable cytogenetics were excluded from study), ECOG performance status 0-2, and WBC count \u226415x10 9 /L, were eligible. Before randomization, each pt was preselected to receive 1 of 3 commonly used CCR for older pts with AML, per investigator choice: IC (standard 7+3 regimen), LDAC (20 mg SC BID x 10 days/28-day cycle), or BSC only. Pts were then randomized to AZA (75 mg/m 2 /day SC x 7 days/28-day cycle) or to CCR, in which case they received their preselected Tx. The primary endpoint was OS. Cytogenetic risk groups were assessed per NCCN criteria by central review: intermediate (INT; all cases), intermediate with normal karyotype (cytogenetic normal [CN]), and poor. Survival at 1 year was compared between Tx. Median OS for AZA vs CCR was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods, hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined by unstratified Cox proportional hazards model, and p values by log-rank test. Results: In all, 488 pts were randomized, 241 to AZA and 247 to CCR. Cytogenetic risk was balanced between Tx groups: 315 pts had INT-risk cytogenetics (AZA n=155 [64%], CCR n=160 [65%]), including 218 who were CN (AZA n=113 [73%], CCR n=105 [66%]), and 170 pts had poor-risk cytogenetics (AZA n=85 [35%], CCR n=85 [34%]). Within each of the 3 cytogenetic risk subgroups, the distribution of pts receiving individual CCR was very consistent: ~18% of each cytogenetic risk subgroup received BSC, ~64% received LDAC, and ~18% received IC. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced among the AZA and CCR Tx arms and the 3 cytogenetic risk groups ( Table ). At baseline, proportionately more pts with poor-risk cytogenetics in the AZA group were aged \u226575 years (57.6% vs 47.1% with CCR) and more pts in the CCR group had AML with myelodysplastic changes (45.9% vs 37.6% with AZA). Median OS (95%CI) in poor-risk pts was significantly prolonged with AZA vs CCR: 6.4 mos (4.2, 8.1) vs 3.2 mos (2.2, 4.7), respectively; HR=0.68 (0.50, 0.94), p=0.019 ( Figure ). Median OS in INT-risk pts was 13.0 mos (11.2, 16.3) vs 10.1 mos (7.1, 13.3) with AZA vs CCR; HR=0.90 (0.70, 1.16), p=0.41. Median OS in the CN subgroup was 14.1 mos (12.6, 19.5) vs 10.0 mos (6.4, 13.3); HR=0.81 (0.59, 1.10), p=0.18. Estimated 1-year survival was higher with AZA vs CCR in all cytogenetic risk subgroups. Twice the proportion of AZA-treated pts in the poor-risk subgroup were alive at 1 year vs. CCR pts (30.9% vs 14.0%, respectively), a clinically meaningful difference of 16.9% (95%CI 4.4, 29.5). Similarly, in the CN subgroup, 60.7% vs 44.1% of pts were alive at 1 year in the AZA and CCR groups, a difference of 16.5% (3.2, 29.8). AZA effect on 1-year survival in the INT-risk subgroup was also favorable (55.2% vs 45.5% with CCR) (difference 9.7% [-1.4, 20.8]). Grade 3-4 hematologic adverse event rates with AZA were consistent with previous reports (Santini, Eur J Haematol, 2010), with no meaningful differences among all cytogenetic risk groups. Conclusions: Median OS in older pts with AML and poor-risk cytogenetics was meaningfully improved with AZA compared with the CCR currently used for AML, with those pts receiving AZA twice as likely to be alive at 1 year as those treated with CCR.
