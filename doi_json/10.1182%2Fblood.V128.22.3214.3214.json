    "abstract_text": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is preceded by monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL), characterized by the presence of monoclonal CLL-like B cells in the peripheral blood, yet at lower numbers than those required for the diagnosis of CLL. MBL is distinguished into low-count (LC-MBL) and high-count (HC-MBL), based on the number of circulating CLL-like cells. While the former does not virtually progress into a clinically relevant disease, the latter may evolve into CLL at a rate of 1% per year. In CLL, genomic studies have led to the discovery of recurrent gene mutations that drive disease progression. These driver mutations may be detected in HC-MBL and even in multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells from CLL patients, suggesting that they may be essential for CLL onset. Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) we profiled LC-MBL and HC-MBL cases but also CLL patients with stable lymphocytosis (range: 39.8-81.8*10 9 CLL cells/l) for >10 years (hereafter termed indolent CLL). This would refine our understanding of the type of genetic aberrations that may be involved in the initial transformation rather than linked to clinical progression as is the case for most, if not all, CLL driver mutations. To this end, we whole-genome sequenced CD19 + CD5 + CD20 dim cells from 6 LC-MBL, 5 HC-MBL and 5 indolent CLL cases; buccal control DNA and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells were analysed in all cases. We also performed targeted deep-sequencing on 11 known driver genes ( ATM , BIRC3 , MYD88 , NOTCH1 , SF3B1 , TP53 , EGR2 , POT1 , NFKBIE , XPO1 , FBXW7 ) in 8 LC-MBL, 13 HC-MBL and 7 indolent CLL cases and paired PMN samples. Overall similar mutation signatures/frequencies were observed for LC/HC-MBL and CLL concerning i) the entire genome; with an average of 2040 somatic mutations observed for LC-MBL, 2558 for HC-MBL and 2400 for CLL (186 for PMN samples), as well as ii) in the exome; with an average of non-synonymous mutations of 8.9 for LC-MBL, 14.6 for HC-MBL, 11.6 for indolent CLL (0.9 for PMN samples). Regarding putative CLL driver genes, WGS analysis revealed only 2 somatic mutations within NOTCH1, and FBXW7 in one HC-MBL case each. After stringent filtering, 106 non-coding variants (NCVs) of potential relevance to CLL were identified in all MBL/CLL samples and 4 NCVs in 2/24 PMN samples. Seventy-two of 110 NCVs (65.5%) caused a potential breaking event in transcription factor binding motifs (TFBM). Of these, 29 concerned cancer-associated genes, including BTG2 , BCL6 and BIRC3 (4, 2 and 2 samples, respectively), while 16 concerned genes implicated in pathways critical for CLL e.g. the NF-\u03baB and spliceosome pathways. Shared mutations between MBL/CLL and their paired PMN samples were identified in all cases: 2 mutations were located within exons, whereas an average of 15.8 mutations/case for LC-MBL, 8.2 for HC-MBL and 9 for CLL, respectively, concerned the non-coding part. Finally, 16 sCNAs were identified in 9 MBL/CLL samples; of the D\u00f6hner model aberrations, only del(13q) was detected in 7/9 cases bearing sCNAs (2 LC-MBL, 3 HC-MBL, 2 indolent CLL). Targeted deep-sequencing analysis (coverage 3000x) confirmed the 2 variants detected by WGS, i.e. in NOTCH1 (n=1) and FBXW7 (n=1), while 4 subclonal likely damaging variants were detected with a VAF <10% in POT1 (n=2), TP53 (n=1), and SF3B1 (n=1) in 4 HC-MBL samples. In conclusion, LC-MBL and CLL with stable lymphocytosis for >10 years display similar low genomic complexity and absence of exonic driver mutations, assessed both with WGS and deep-sequencing, underscoring their common low propensity to progress. On the other hand, HC-MBL comprising cases that may ultimately evolve into clinically relevant CLL can acquire exonic driver mutations associated with more dismal prognosis, as exemplified by subclonal driver mutations detected by deep-sequenicng. The existence of NCVs in TFBMs targeting pathways critical for CLL prompts further investigation into their actual relevance to the clinical behavior. Shared mutations between CLL and PMN cells indicate that some somatic mutations may occur before CLL onset, likely at the hematopoietic stem-cell level. Their potential oncogenic role likely depends on the cellular context and/or microenvironmental stimuli to which the affected cells are exposed.
