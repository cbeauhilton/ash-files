    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) causes great impact in quality of life (Q/L), since patients become dependant of others even for routine activity execution and personal care. Objectives: To characterize the impact of MM in the Q/L of patients treated in two public institutions of Sao Paulo State, Brazil, using a generic (SF-36) and a specific questionnaire for oncologic patient (QLQ-C30), applied in three different moments: at diagnosis, after the end of clinical treatment and at day +100 after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT). Patients and methods: From March 2006 to August 2007 we evaluated 49 patients with MM, using the two questionnaires. Analysis was made through ANOVA, Post hoc and T-paired test comparing the three groups. Results: 88.6% of included patients have family budget lower than US$ 600.00/month (Economic Class C, D or E). The generic questionnaire SF-36 demonstrated that Physical Functioning , Role-Physical and Bodily Pain were statistically different in all three groups, favoring the day +100 post-ASCT group (ANOVA). SF-36 still demonstrated improvement in Role-Emotional when MM post treatment group was compared with the day + 100 post-ASCT group (T-paired Test). The QLQ-C30 questionnaire confirmed what had been demonstrated by the SF-36 in relation to the Physical Functioning and Bodily Pain plus improvement in the following aspects: Role Functioning, Fatigue , Lack of Appetite and Constipation , favoring the day + 100 post-ASCT group (ANOVA). QLQ-C30 also detected a significant improvement in Social Aspect in patients with MM after day +100 of ASCT. Conclusion: The specific questionnaire for cancer patients QLQ-C30 seems to be more informative than the generic questionnaire SF-36 and reflects the real benefit of ASCT in Q/L of MM patients from two public Brazilian institutions, which provide assistance for economically challenged population.",
