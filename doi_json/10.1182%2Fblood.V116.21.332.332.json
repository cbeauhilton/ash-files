    "abstract_text": "Abstract 332 Background: Older patients (pts, \u226560 years [yrs]) with AML have a dismal prognosis; the majority are not treated with any type of chemotherapy. Many have antecedent myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and 20\u201330% harbor chromosome 5 abnormalities. Lenalidomide (LEN) yields hematologic responses in 67% of lower-risk MDS pts with the del(5q) cytogenetic lesion, and complete responses (CRs) in 20% of higher-risk del(5q) MDS pts, all with isolated lesions. This Phase II study explores the safety and efficacy of single agent LEN in previously untreated older pts with AML and the del(5q) abnormality. Method: Untreated older pts with AML defined by 2001 World Health Organization criteria (without t(15;17)) who harbored a del(5q) cytogenetic abnormality (alone or in combination with other abnormalities) and who declined or were felt to be poor candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy were eligible. Pts were treated with LEN 50mg daily for up to 28 days as induction therapy. Concomitant cytotoxic or growth factor therapies were not allowed. Pts achieving stable disease or better per day 28 bone marrow assessment received post-remission LEN 10mg daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. Enrollment from October 2006 through June 2010 was in 2 stages: 20 pts were registered; if at least 1 CR/CRi was observed using International Working Group response criteria, another 20 pts were to be enrolled. The study was designed with a critical level of 4.7% (erroneously concluding the regimen warrants further study if the true response rate is 5% or less) and power of 92% (probability of concluding that a response rate of 20% warrants further study). Result: Of 41 patients enrolled, 4 were excluded (2 without AML, 1 without del(5q), and 1 died prior to receiving therapy), leaving 37 for toxicity and efficacy analyses. Median age was 74 yrs (range, 60\u201394), 21 (57%) were female, 33 (89%) white, and 19 (51%) had prior MDS. Median presenting white blood cell count was 2,600 mcl (range, 600\u2013658,000), and 30 (81%) had a performance status of 1. Of the 37 evaluable pts, 29 had pretreatment cytogenetic studies evaluated centrally. Two pts displayed no demonstrable abnormalities (but had del(5q) by fluorescence in situ hybridization); 5 had isolated del (5q); and 22 (76%) had complex karyotypes (\u22653 abnormalities). Seven patients were removed from protocol therapy due to toxicities (infection, renal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and rash), and 4 deaths occurred that were at least possibly related to therapy: 2 respiratory, 1 cardiac, and 1 febrile neutropenia. Five additional patients had grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities: hypocalcemia (2), fatigue (2), infection (1). Fourteen pts (38%) completed protocol induction therapy. Four pts (11%) of the 37 evaluable pts achieved CR/CRi following induction therapy, all of whom had complex karyotypes; 3 of the 4 relapsed after 1, 2, and 4 months, and the 4 th died 13 months after CR without a report of relapse. Thirteen (35%) pts had stable disease following induction therapy; 8 went on to protocol post-remission therapy. Thirty-three of the 37 pts have died and the median overall survival was 2 months (95% CI, 1 to 4 months). The follow-up time of the 4 survivors was between 6 and 23 months. Conclusion: LEN as a single agent has modest activity and expected toxicity in older del(5q) AML pts, particularly when compared to other single-agent molecularly-targeted approaches, such as FLT3 inhibitors. Future trials will combine LEN with cytoxic or hypomethylator therapies in older del(5q) AML pts. Disclosures: Sekeres: Celgene: Honoraria. Off Label Use: Lenalidomide in (del)5q AML.
