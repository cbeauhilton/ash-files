    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains a curative treatment for patients with advanced lymphomas. Haploidentical donors (HID) have recently extended transplantation for patients without HLA matched donors. Fludarabine (F) with melphalan (M) 140mg/m2 is the current standard of care conditioning regimen for ASCT. We hypothesized that progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with HID is comparable to that of HLA matched transplants, and that lower doses of melphalan (100mg/m2) are equally effective for these patients. Here, we analyzed outcomes of all lymphoma patients who received ASCT from different donors with FM conditioning at our institution between 09/2009-01/2018. Methods: A total of 186 pts (63 matched related, MRD, 98 matched unrelated, MUD and 25 HID) were included. 30 patients had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 54 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and 77 Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The median follow-up was 57 (range 3-101) months. Patients received F160mg/m2 with M140mg/m2 (FM140) or 100mg/m2 (FM100). FM100 regimen was used in older patients/significant comorbidities. Thiotepa 5mg/kg or TBI 200cGy was added to HID transplants. All matched transplants received standard graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis (tacrolimus + methotrexate +/-ATG for MUDs), while HID group received PTCy-based GVHD prophylaxis. The cumulative incidence (CI) of non-relapse mortality (NRM), disease progression, and GVHD was estimated accounting for competing events. Regression analysis accounting for competing events was used to evaluate predictors of outcomes. Results: Patients' characteristics were well balanced in donor groups except for advanced stage 3-4 disease (HID 77% vs MRD 51%, p=0.03), use of FM100 regimen (HID 64% vs. MUD 11% vs. MRD 10%, p3 chemotherapy regimens (HR=1.8, p=0.01) received prior to transplant. Including donor type and melphalan dose in MV analysis did not alter these results. Conclusions: HID transplants have lower relapse rates and higher NRM comparing with MRDs, while no significant differences were seen comparing with MUDs, and similar survival compared with HLA matched transplants in patients with lymphoma receiving FM-based conditioning regimen. Our results suggest that FM100-based conditioning, which was used primarily in older individuals, is equivalent to FM140 and could be used as prefered standard conditioning regimen for ASCT for patients with lymphoma. Controlled studies are need to compare FM100 with FM140 conditioning and to evaluate PTCY-based GVHD prophylaxis in HLA matched transplants.
