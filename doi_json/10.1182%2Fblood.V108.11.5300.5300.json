    "abstract_text": "RATIONALE OF STUDY: Despite significant advances in prevention and therapy, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection still represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The standard pre-emptive treatment is based on intravenous administration of Ganciclovir (GCV). Valganciclovir (VGC), the pro-drug formulation of GCV is characterised by an excellent bio availability, making this drug suitable for oral administration. PATIENTS: Since March 2003 all patients treated with reduced (27 patients) or fully ablative (3 patients) conditioning regimens followed by sibling HSCT, were monitored with bi-weekly CMV/PCR and pp65/assays. Overall 15 episodes of CMV positivity were detected in seven patients. Patients resulted positive (3 cells pp65+ or 1000/100000 PCR +) started oral treatment with VGC 900 mg bid, for the first fourteen days, followed by 900 mg q.d. up to at least seven days after assays normalization. The median duration of therapy was 21 days (range 10\u201321 days). No significant toxicity was observed. All patients had a normalization of CMV/PCR and pp65/assays within fourteen days, with a response rate (RR) of 100%. In two patients the oral VGC therapy was changed to the intravenous administration of Foscavir, because of concomitant neutropenia and acute GvHD. CONCLUSION: Pre-emptive treatment of CMV infection with VGC is safe, feasible and effective. Furthermore, the oral administration of this drug in an outpatient setting, reduces significantly the costs compared with a therapy that needs hospitalization as intravenous Ganciclovir.",
