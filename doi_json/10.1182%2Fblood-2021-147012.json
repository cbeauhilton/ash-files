    "abstract_text": "Introduction: While previous studies propose pesticide exposure to be a risk factor for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) development, results are inconclusive. In addition, the impact of pesticide exposure on NHL survival is not well-established. Therefore, we identified NHL patients from the California Cancer Registry and linked these patients with the statewide pesticide use reporting database to determine the impact of pesticide exposure on NHL-related incidence and outcomes. Methods: Using the California Cancer Registry, we identified patients with a first primary diagnosis of NHL from 2010-2016 and linked these patients with CalEnviroScreen 3.0 to obtain production agriculture pesticide exposure to 70 chemicals from the state mandated Pesticide Use Reporting (PUR) by census tract from 2012-2014. In addition, data from PUR was integrated into a geographic information system that employs land use data to estimate cumulative exposure to specific pesticides previously associated with NHL (glyphosate, organophosphorus, carbamate, phenoxyherbicide and 2,4-dimethylamine salt) between 10 years prior up to 1 year after NHL diagnosis. SEER*Stat software was used to calculate NHL subtype incidence rates by census tract pesticide use level. Multivariable cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the impact of total pesticide exposure from CalEnviroScreen 3.0 and individual pesticide exposure from geographic land use data on lymphoma-specific and overall survival. Results: Among 35,808 NHL patients identified, 44.2% were exposed to pesticide in their census tract of residence. Pesticide exposure was higher in Hispanic/Latino (46.5%) and non-Hispanic white (45.6%) then Asian/Pacific Islander (37.2%) and African American (34.9%) patients with NHL. Glyphosate, organophosphorus, carbamate, phenoxyherbicide and 2,4-dimethylamine salt exposure was reported in 34.1%, 26.0%, 10.6%, 14.0% and 12.8% of NHL patients, respectively. Pesticide exposure was not associated with increased NHL incidence by NHL subtype or subgroups defined by sociodemographic factors. Total pesticide exposure at time of diagnosis was not associated with lymphoma-specific or overall survival. In addition, no association was consistently found between glyphosate, organophosphorus, carbamate, phenoxyherbicide and 2,4 dimethylamine salt exposure and lymphoma-specific or overall survival. Conclusion: In this large population-based study of neighborhood agricultural pesticide exposure, pesticide exposure was noted to be prevalent among patients diagnosed with NHL, with high pesticide exposure particularly observed in Hispanics/Latinos and non-Hispanic whites. However, pesticide exposure was not consistently associated with increased NHL incidence or worse NHL lymphoma-specific or overall survival.
