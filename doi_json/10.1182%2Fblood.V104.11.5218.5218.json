    "abstract_text": "Aim: To make clear the feasibility of Ifosfamide/Etoposide (IE) regimen combined with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for the collection of autologous peripheral blood stem cells (APBSC), we evaluated the number of the collected CD34 positive cells, and the regimen-related toxicities. Patients\u2019 characteristics and Methods: 19 Patients (male 12, female 7) were received APBSC harvest in our hospitals during Aug. 2000 to Dec. 2003 with age of 54.3 years on average (30\u201366). Diagnoses were included HD (n=2), NHL (n=13), MM (n=3), and malignant synovioma (n=1). IE regimen was included with Ifomide 2000 mg/m2 (day 1), and Etoposide 200 mg/m2 (day 1\u20133) (4cases) or 500 mg/m2 (day 1,2) (15 cases). For the prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis patients were administered with Mesna, and NaHCO3 during and after 1 day of the administration of Ifosfamide. G-CSF was administered at the dose of 10 ug/kg (lenograstim) or 300 ug/m2 (filgrastim) when blood absolute neutrophil count came down to 1000/mm3. When the suppression of bone marrow was recovered and blood WBC count came up to 5000/m3, CD34-positive cells were counted in blood, and APBSC was harvested when blood CD34-positive cells were determined above 0.1 %. APBSC was harvested with CS-3000 plus (Fenwall). Result: The median duration from the start of the administration of G-CSF to the finish of APBSC harvest was 6.5 days (4\u201311). The median number of CD34-positive cells of the harvested was 4.32 x 106/kg (1.10\u201313.50). All cases were harvested. The toxicities during from the conditioning to the harvest were included with grade 1 headache (2 cases), grade 2 nausea (6 cases), grade 1 bleeding (1 case), grade 1 constipation (1 case), grade 1 fever (1 case), and grade 1 thrombocytopenia (1 case). Conclusion: IE regimen combined with G-CSF was feasible to harvest APBSC on the yield of the collection of the transplantable stem cells, and on the regimen-related toxicities."
