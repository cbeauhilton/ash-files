    "abstract_text": "Few clinical studies have investigated the role of salvaged unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT) for progressive hematologic malignancies. The aim of this report is to identify the potential benefits of unrelated CBT in progressive hematologic malignancies.19 consecutive patients with progressive myeloid and lymphoid malignancies who received salvaged CBT following myeloablative conditioning regimens (12 TBI/CY/Ara-C, 6 Bu / CY / Ara-C, and 1 Bu /CY) from July 2005 to December 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. Of the 19 patients, 6 suffered from acute myeloid leukemia(AML), 5 acute lymphoid leukemia(ALL),\uff1a1 acute mixed lineage leukemia (AMLL), 1 myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia with excess blasts(MDS-RAEB), 2 acute myeloid leukemia transformed from myelodysplastic syndrome, and 4 lymphoma, all of them in non-remission (NR) before transplantation. Median age of them were 13\uff08range 6-32\uff09years and median body weight were 45 (range 18\u201373 ) kg. All patients received 1 CBT unit \u22642 loci HLA-mismatched with the recipient. Infused TNC was 4.07\uff08range 2.76-6.02\uff09\u00d710 7 /kg and CD34+ stem cell 2.08\uff08range 0.99-8.65\uff09\u00d710 5 /kg. All patients were engrafted with neutrophil exceeded 0.5\u00d710 9 /L on median day +17\uff08range 14-37d\uff09and plt counts of\uff1e20\u00d710 9 /L on median day +35 (range 17-70d). 10 patients (52.6%) experienced pre-engraftment syndrome (PES) and 3 (15.8%) patients progressed to acute GVHD. The incidence of \u2161-\u2163 aGVHD and cGVHD were 10.5% and 21.1%. With a median follow up of 10(range 1-58) months\uff0c10 cases survived and 2 relapsed\uff0eThe estimated 2 year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) rate was 45.6%, 34.2% and 39.8%. Salvaged CBT might be a promising modality for treatment of progressive hematologic malignancies, even with high leukemia burden. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
