    "abstract_text": "Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and leukemic relapse are the most serious complications of allogeneic (allo) stem cell transplantation (SCT), and separating desirable graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects from GVHD remains the ultimate challenge to successful outcomes. The recruitment of activated T cells to host target tissues (GVHD) or sites of leukemic infiltration (GVL) is likely mediated by chemokine receptor:ligand interactions. CCR1 is a chemokine receptor that binds to CC chemokines including RANTES (CCL5), and is expressed on a variety of cells including activated T cells, monocytes, and macrophages. We have previously shown that mRNA expression of both CCR1 and RANTES is increased in GVHD target tissues following allo-SCT. Using a well established murine SCT model (B6->B6D2F1) and mice deficient in CCR1, we examined the contribution of CCR1 expression to allo T cell responses in vitro and to GVH and GVL effects in vivo. Lethally (1100cGy) irradiated B6D2F1 mice received SCT either from syngeneic (B6D2F1) or allogeneic (B6) CCR1+/+ or CCR1\u2212/\u2212 donors. The severity of GVHD was assessed by survival and a well described clinical scoring system. Syngeneic SCT recipients all survived and were indistinguishable from nai\u0308ve, untransplanted controls, whereas animals receiving allo-SCT from CCR1+/+ donors developed significant GVHD. By contrast, allo-SCT with CCR1\u2212/\u2212 donor cells resulted in significantly improved survival (92% vs. 50%) and less severe clinical GVHD (p<0.01) by day 35 compared to allo-CCR1+/+ controls. GVL effects were next assessed by adding 500 P815 tumor cells (H-2 d and syngeneic to host) to the bone marrow inoculum on day 0. F1 recipients of syngeneic BMT all died from tumor infiltration by day +15. Although all allo-SCT recipients effectively rejected their tumor, mice receiving CCR1-/\u2212 SCT had significantly improved leukemia free survival (45% vs. 5%) by day 60 compared to allo controls. At higher tumor doses, significant GVL activity remained in CCR1\u2212/\u2212 SCT recipients, but the survival advantage was lost. Further examination of allo T cell responses in vivo revealed that day 7 splenic T cell expansion and serum IFN\u03b3 levels were significantly lower following CCR1\u2212/\u2212 SCT (p < 0.01). Surprisingly, proliferation and IFN\u03b3 secretion were also reduced by ~70% when CCR1\u2212/\u2212 T cells were stimulated with host antigens in vitro, whereas CTL activity remained equivalent to CCR1+/+ controls. The reduction in proliferation was not secondary to a migration defect, but was dependent on interactions between CCR1 and RANTES; neutralization of RANTES with a monoclonal antibody significantly reduced proliferation of CCR1+/+ T cells in a dose dependent manner. Finally, we found that GVHD mortality was also less when RANTES\u2212/\u2212 mice were used as recipients in a second, MHC-disparate, SCT model (p = 0.03). Collectively these data demonstrate a critical role for CCR1 in donor T cell alloreactivity following SCT. These responses contribute to both GVHD and GVL effects in vivo and are likely dependent upon interactions between CCR1 and the chemokine ligand RANTES.",
