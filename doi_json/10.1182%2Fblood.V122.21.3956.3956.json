    "abstract_text": "Background The DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) 5-azacitidine (Aza) and decitabine (Dac) are a standard of care for patients with myelodysplatic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Many hypotheses exist for the mechanism of these agents, including re-expression of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes and direct cytotoxicity. We and others have shown hypermethylation of WNT/\u03b2-catenin inhibitory genes in primary MDS and AML samples. Activation of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling has furthermore been shown to play a role in the development and relapse of AML. Inhibition of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling is proposed to be clinically beneficial in AML. Based on published and preliminary data demonstrating that AML cell lines exposed to Aza and Dac re-express WNT/b-catenin inhibitors and down-regulate WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling, we hypothesized that patients with AML receiving Dac would demonstrate suppression of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling in circulating blasts. Methods We obtained serial peripheral blood samples from 5 patients with AML during their first cycle of Dac therapy (20 mg/m 2 per day for 10 days). These patients were ineligible for high-dose induction chemotherapy based on age, performance status or comorbid illness and were of intermediate or poor risk karyotype. All patients had circulating blasts at presentation, which remained stable or declined over time. Blast populations were identified using flow cytometric selection based upon the characteristics of the diagnostic sample. Global methylation was assessed (using LINE-1 as a surrogate) by bisulfite pyrosequencing of mononuclear cell DNA extracted from the peripheral blood. To determine whether reduced methylation was associated with decreases in WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling, we performed imaging flow cytometry (ImageStream, Amnis Corporation) on viable blasts harvested pre-treatment and on days 5-9 of the first Dac cycle (at the methylation nadir). ImageStream was used to assess nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin, a biochemical hallmark of active WNT signaling, in CD34+ blasts. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin was quantified using a similarity score: a log-transformed Pearson's correlation coefficient between the digitized images of immunostained \u03b2-catenin and a nuclear stain (DAPI). A resolution metric (Fishers discriminant ratio, R d ) was calculated to determine shifts in the population distributions of this similarity score between CD34+ blasts at diagnosis versus after Dac therapy; a negative R d value indicates decreased similarity scores between \u03b2-catenin and DAPI in treated versus diagnostic samples and thus decreased nuclear \u03b2-catenin. To determine whether changes in nuclear \u03b2-catenin were associated with changes in gene transcription, we performed whole genome analysis of RNA extracted from diagnostic and follow up samples (n = 5 paired samples, Illumina Human-HT12v4 Expression BeadChip). Results As expected, Dac treatment significantly reduced global DNA methylation (LINE-1 methylation) from 77.0 \u00b1 1.6% pre-treatment to a nadir of 60.9 \u00b1 6.8% (p< 0.01, n = 6). During the methylation nadir (days 5 to 9), the cellular distribution of \u03b2-catenin in CD34+ blasts shifted from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as indicated by an average R d value of -0.22 (n = 5). This R d value is similar to that observed after treating U937 cells with 0.5 \u00b5M Dac. The total amount of \u03b2-catenin in CD34+ blasts from treated patients did not change compared to their pre-treatment levels (0.98 \u00b1 0.40 fold, n = 5) indicating that the shift in the cellular distribution of \u03b2-catenin from the nucleus towards the cytoplasm was not accompanied by decreased protein level. Comparison of samples from day 5-9 of Dac treatment to pre-treatment samples revealed 128 genes with a \u2265 1.2-fold change (75 up, 53 down, p< 0.05) in mRNA levels. We did not observe changes in expression of WNT regulatory genes, suggesting that alternative mechanisms may explain the reduction in nuclear \u03b2-catenin following Dac therapy. Of the 10 genes up-regulated more than 1.5-fold, 4 ( FOS, EGR1, CLEC12A, RNASE2 ) are associated with myeloid differentiation. Of these, FOS and EGR1 are negatively regulated by WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Conclusions Given that activation of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling can suppress hematopoietic differentiation, these data suggest a model in which Dac exposure reduces nuclear \u03b2-catenin, leading to increased expression of pro-differentiation genes.
