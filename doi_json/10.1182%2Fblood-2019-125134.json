    "abstract_text": "Background : 18F-FDG-PET/CT is currently the standard technique to define minimal residual disease (MRD) status outside the bone marrow (BM) in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. A joined analysis of two prospective randomized trials in newly diagnosed transplant-eligible MM (NDTEMM) patients applied for the first time the Deauville Scores (DS) to focal lesions (FS) and bone marrow uptake (BMS) and showed the liver background (DS < 4) to be the best cut-off to define PET negativity after therapy (Zamagni et al, ASH 2018). Multiparameter Flow cytometry (MFC) at the sensitivity level of 10 -5 is one of the standardized methods to assess MRD in the BM (Kumar SK, Lancet Oncol 2016). In this analysis, we aimed at comparing MRD data by PET/TC assessment and MFC in the multicenter phase II randomized FORTE trial for NDTEMM patients. Methods : NDTEMM patients \u226465 years were randomized to receive carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone (KRD) induction - autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) intensification-KRd consolidation (arm A); KRd12 (arm B) and carfilzomib, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone (KCd) induction-ASCT intensification-KCd consolidation (arm C). Thereafter, patients were randomized to maintenance with lenalidomide alone or lenalidomide plus carfilzomib. MRD evaluation was performed by 8-color second-generation flow cytometry (sensitivity 10 -5 ) in patients who achieved at least VGPR before maintenance (Gay F, ASCO 2019). PET/CT scans were performed locally at baseline (B) and prior to the start of maintenance (PM) and the DS were applied both in the BM and FLs as previously described. Cram\u00e9r's V coefficient was used to measure the concordance between PET/TC and MFC; Fisher or X 2 tests were adopted, where appropriate, to evaluate the statistical significance, at the level of 0.05. Results: 182 out of the 474 global patients enrolled in the trial had a matched PET/CT and MFC evaluation available and were included in the present analysis. Baseline characteristics of the patients were as follows: median age 57 years, ISS and R-ISS stage III 18% and 10%, respectively, high-risk cytogenetics (t(4;14) \u00b1 del(17p) \u00b1 t(14;16), detected by FISH) 26%, reflecting baseline clinical features of the entire FORTE population. At B, 92% of the patients had FLs, with a median maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 5.7 [IQR: 4.1-8.1], 11% presented extra-medullary lesions and nearly all the patients had increased BM uptake, with a median SUVmax of 3.3 [IQR: 2.8-4.3]. FS and BMS \u22654 were present in 87% and 59% of the patients, respectively. A higher FS at B was significantly correlated with ISS stage III (P= 0.04), while higher BMS with lower hemoglobin level (P= 0.002) and higher free light chain ratio (P= 0.004). At PM, PET/TC negativity according to DS < 4, was present in 78% in the FLs and 85% in the BM, respectively. No significant correlations between PET/CT negativity after therapy and baseline prognostic factors or PET/CT characteristics were found. 95% and 67.5% of the patients achieved \u2265 VGPR and CR as best response, respectively, while 75% of them achieved MFC MRD negativity. The achievement of a best CR significantly correlated with BMS < 4 at PM (P= 0.013). We analyzed the concordance between MRD results by the two techniques and Cram\u00e9r's V coefficient measured a strong association, with a value of 0.76 (p<0.001). In particular, concordance between PET/CT BMS and MFC was 94% (80% both negative, 14% both positive) while 6% were PET/CT negative and MFC positive. FS and MFC were concordant in 63% of the cases (57% both negative, 6% both positive) while 20% were PET/CT negative and MFC positive and 17% showed residual FLs in the context of MFC negativity. The persistence of MFC positivity at PM was significantly related to a higher BMS and SUVmax at the same time-point. Conclusion : In conclusion, the present analysis confirms the applicability and validity of DS criteria for the definition of PET/CT MRD outside the BM in an independent prospective series of NDTEMM patients. PET/CT negativity significantly correlated with the achievement of best CR. PET/CT and MFC at the sensitivity level of 10 -5 showed a good concordance in the BM, while were also confirmed to be complementary outside (FLs). Future analyses will show the impact of PET/CT in comparison with BM MRD techniques on patient's outcomes.
