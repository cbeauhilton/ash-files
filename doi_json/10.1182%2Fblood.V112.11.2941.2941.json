    "abstract_text": "The expression of CXCR4 (CD184) has been associated with poor prognosis in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and it has also been suggested that the CXCL12(SDF-1a)/CXCR4 interaction contributes to the resistance of leukemia cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of CXCR4 was found to enhance chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in a subset of leukemic myeloblasts that carry Flt3 mutations and to overcome chemoresistance associated with stromal activity. NPM variants with a cytoplasmic localization represent the most common mutation detected in myeloid malignancies and are associated with a favourable clinical outcome. A recent study provides biological evidence for a novel role for NPM as a negative regulator of CXCR4 signalling induced by CXCL12: suppression of NPM expression enhanced chemotactic responses to CXCL12, and conversely, over-expression of a cytosolic NPM mutant reduced chemotaxis induced by CXCL12. We investigated whether CD184 expression is a negative predictor factor for response to chemotherapy and if there is clinical evidence that NPM mutations could overcome chemoresistance to induction therapy in this subset of patients. The expression of CD184 was analyzed by flow cytometric methods in a group of 70 cases of adult AML at onset of disease, diagnosed at our Institution since January 2006. The diagnosis was performed according to FAB/WHO criteria; all patients received intensive chemotherapy according to institutional protocols. There were 34 males and 36 females and median age was 46 years (range 18\u201365). AML cells were gated based upon their CD45 expression and samples were considered positive if CD184 was expressed by more than 20% of blasts. CD184 was positive in 45 and negative in 25 cases. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of sex, age, Hb level, WBC and Plt counts, percentage of blasts, and occurrence of the NPM mutation. The CR rate was 45% in CD184+ and 82% in CD184- (p=0.03); among CD184+ cases, the CR rate was significantly higher in NPMc+ cases, (p=0.03). Our results show that CD184 expression is associated with a lower rate of CR after induction therapy and this association is stronger in NPM unmutated cases, suggesting that CD184 expression is a negative predictive factor for response to chemotherapy. Further data are needed to verify if the biological role of the cytosolic NPM mutant as a negative regulator of CXCR4 signalling induced by CXCL12 could have a clinical role contributing to overcome the resistance of leukemic cells to induction chemotherapy.",
