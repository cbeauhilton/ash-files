    "abstract_text": "Introduction The majority of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cases are characterized by PML-RAR\u03b1 fusion gene. Although PML-RAR\u03b1 fusion gene can be detected in more than 98% of APL cases, RAR\u03b1 is also found to be fused with other partner genes, which are also related to ATRA-dependent transcriptional activity and cell differentiation. In this study, we identified a novel RAR\u03b1 fusion gene, TBLR1-RAR\u03b1, in a rare case of APL with a t(3;17)(q26;q21),t(7;17)(q12;q21) complex chromosomal rearrangement. The structure, pathogenesis and response to drug therapy of the novel fusion gene were investigated to illustrate the characteristics, pathogenesis and the therapeutic effect in this variant APL. Methods To identify and amplify the novel chimeric fusion transcript, 5\u2019 RACE and RT-PCR was performed. The TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 expression vector was constructed and transfected into 293T cell line by Lipofectamine2000 reagent. When the transfected 293T cell line was treated with or without ATRA, the expression level and the subcellular localization of TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 were investigated by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis, and then coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analysis were performed to investigate the formation of homodimer and the recruitment of the corepressors by TBLR1-RAR\u03b1. Dual-luciferase assay was used to clarify the transcriptional activity of TBLR1-RAR\u03b1. Then, a lentiviral vector of TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 was constructed and infected the HL-60 cell line. The HL-60 cells which highly expressed TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 were sorted by flow cytometry. Colony formation assay and flow cytometry analysis were performed to detect the differentiation status in the TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 highly expressed HL-60 cells. Results In our study, the novel TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 fusion gene was cloned from an APL patient who demonstrated the typical clinical features of APL, such as bleeding tendency, leukocytosis, hypergranular promyelocytes accumulated in the bone marrow, coagulopathy. However, RT-PCR analysis and FISH studies failed to detect PML-RAR\u03b1 fusion gene in this case, while karyotype analysis revealed a rare complex translocation, t(3;17)(q26;q21),t(7;17)(q12;q21). When treated with ATRA, As 2 O 3 and chemotherapeutic drugs, this patient achieved complete remission. After three courses of consolidation therapies, the patient relapsed with leukocytosis and the bone marrow karyotype analysis displayed a recurring chromosomal rearrangement, 46,xy,t(3;17)(q26;q21),t(7;17)(q12;q21),5q+,6q-,10q+,11p-, which was more complex in comparison with the karyotype at diagnosis. There have been nine RAR\u03b1 fusion genes reported so far. Like other RAR\u03b1 fusion genes, TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 contains the exon 3 and the 3\u2019 sequence of RAR\u03b1. TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 oncoprotein contains the LisH domain from TBLR1 and the B-F domains from RAR\u03b1. TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 diffusely locates in nucleus and cytoplasm. Like other RAR\u03b1 fusion protein, TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 can form homodimer and recruit corepressors to inhibit the transcription of the RAR\u03b1 target gene. TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 inhibits the RAR\u03b1 transcriptional activation in a dominant-negative manner and the transcriptional inhibition can be rescued by overexpression of wild-type RAR\u03b1. In the presence of pharmacological doses of ATRA, TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 could be degraded and its homodimerization was abrogated. Moreover, when treated with ATRA, TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 could mediate the dissociation and degradation of transcriptional corepressors and consequently transactivated transcription of RAR\u03b1 target genes and induced cell differentiation in a dose- and time- dependent manner. Finally, TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 was also detected in another two cases of APL with t(3;17) chromosomal translocation. Conclusions In this study, we discovered a novel RAR\u03b1 fusion gene TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 from a APL patient with t(3;17) chromosomal translocation, and investigated its function, pathogenesis and response to drug treatment. Unlike wild-type RAR\u03b1, TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 can form homodimer, recruit more corepressors to inhibit the transcription of RAR\u03b1 target gene and play a role in APL pathogenesis. The transcriptional inhibition of TBLR1-RAR\u03b1 can be rescued by overexpression of RAR\u03b1 and ATRA treatment and finally leads to cell differentiation.
