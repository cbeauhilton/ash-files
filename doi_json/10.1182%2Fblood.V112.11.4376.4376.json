    "abstract_text": "Objective: To investigate the incidence, risk factor and management of CMV reactivation in patients revived hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT). Methods: 374 patients including 275 consecutive allogeneic and 99 autologous patients after bone marrow/stem cell transplantation from May 2001 to December 2007 were studied at our institution with nest-PCR and pp65 antigen assay. Anticoagulant blood samples were obtained from the recipients once weekly after days 14. After three months the CMV monitoring was performed every one month or every three months. If the patients catch CMV again after three year, the CMV monitoring was performed again. Results: The incidence of CMV positive in autologous patients was 3.03% and was 54.91% in allogeneic patients with a median onset of 48 days post transplants during 1 to 81 months. The difference between them is significant; The infection rate in the nonmyeloablative allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation (NST) group was 61.76%, in the group of HLA\u2014identical sibling donor HSCT(sib-HSCT) was 47.10%, in haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Hi-HSCT) group was 75.00% and in the group of unrelated bone marrow transplantation (UR-BMT) was 57.45%. The infection rate of CMV in the Hi-HSCT group was higher than that in the group of sib-HSCT with significant difference (P<0.05); The incidence rate of CMV infection in patients with regimen including ATG was higher than that without ATG ((65%&47.1%, P<0.05); The incidence rate of CMV infection in patients with III\u2013IV grade aGVHD and patients without III\u2013IV aGVHD had not significant difference (P>0.05). There was not significant difference in the occurance of aGVHD between the patients with and without CMV infection (P>0.05).5.87.8% patients are effective on antiviral therapy, incidence of CMV disease is very low, 0.65% patients catch CMV more than once. Conclusion FCMV infection is common in our study, Minoriting CMV for long time is necessary, which benefit to antiviral therapy and judging of prognosis.",
