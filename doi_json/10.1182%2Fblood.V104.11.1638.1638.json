    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can cure adults with hematologic malignancies, but results in significant morbidity and mortality. Graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication; attempts to reduce the risk of GVHD include selecting donors based on several characteristics, including parity, a criterion which has been controversial. This retrospective cohort study using data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) is the first multi-center analysis of the effects of donor and recipient parity on outcomes of HSCT in the modern transplant era. Methods : We studied patients at least 18 years old who received a non-T-cell-depleted, myeloablative HLA-identical sibling HSCT between 1995 and 1999, for acute lymphoblastic or myelogenous leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia. The study endpoints included acute and chronic GVHD, overall survival, and relapse. There were 2,626 patients who met inclusion criteria and had complete information on both donor and recipient pregnancy status. Donors and recipients were categorized as: males, nulliparous females, or parous (one or more pregnancies) females. Analysis : We compared all possible combinations of donor and recipient pregnancy status (9 groups in total); the reference group was male donor/male recipient pairs. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for other prognostic factors. Because multiple groups were compared, significant p-values were considered to be less than or equal to 0.006. Results : After controlling for important patient-, disease-, and transplant-related covariates, the risk of chronic GVHD was significantly increased in parous female donor/male recipient pairs (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.23 \u2013 1.94, p < 0.0001). Neither donor nor recipient parity had an impact on overall survival, acute GVHD, or relapse risk. Conclusions : This multi-center retrospective registry study showed that parous female donors resulted in a significantly increased risk of chronic GVHD in male recipients, but without concomitant reduction in relapse. Thus, H-Y antigens may be important targets of GVHD, but not of a graft-versus-leukemia effect. As when selecting unrelated donors, avoidance of parous female donors, particularly for male patients, in HLA-identical sibling transplants is recommended when possible.",
