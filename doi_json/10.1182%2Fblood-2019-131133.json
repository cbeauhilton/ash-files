    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Although high rates of emergency department (ED) visits by sickle cell disease patient population is a significant health-care system burden, there are limited studies available that explore outpatient/ED visit patterns. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pattern of medical care utilization including clinic visits and hospital admission in adults with sickle cell disease in a large urban academic center with a dedicated 24 hour/7 day a week sickle cell emergency room. Methods: Patients seen in the Acute Care at Grady Memorial Hospital Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center (GMHSCC) over a three years from January 2015 to December 2017 where analyzed. The Acute Care center at GRMHSCC is a unique 24 hour 7 day a week dedicated emergency room for sickle cell patients. Patient demographics, specialized sickle cell clinic visits and hospital admissions were analyzed descriptively. Independent samples t-test was used for comparison of hospitalization and acute care visits between males/females and phenotype groups. Results: The total of 1,277 patients were included in analysis representing 12,129 acute care visits. 683 (53.5%) females and 593 males (46.5%). Mean age was 32.9 years. Genotypes where similar to known expected distributions, 878 patients had Hb SS (68.8%), 301 had SC (23.6%), 23 had SB0TH (1.8%) and 74 had SB+TH (5.8%). The mean number of acute care visits over 3 years for SS phenotype was 9.71, SC phenotype 9.74, SB+Th phenotype 5.73 and SB0TH phenotype 10.48. Overall admission rate was 16%. There was a significant statistical difference between the mean number of admissions among SS and SC phenotype patients (p=0.009). Rate of hospitalization per clinic visit for SS phenotype was 18.19% , for SC phenotype 10.78% , SB+TH phenotype was 15.58% and SB0TH phenotype 9.55%; Conclusions and future objectives: We have demonstrated that a dedicated Sickle Cell emergency room is able to achieve a significantly lower admission rate than standard Emergency rooms. Preliminary analysis shows that the distribution of acute care visits is distributed across the genotypes at the known distribution. In addition there is no difference in mean number of sickle cell acute visits between patients with SS and SC phenotype. This is interesting as Hgb SC is considered a less severe form of the disease. There was a statistically significant higher admission rate for SS patients compared to SC patients. Future analyses will look at additional parameters associated with acute care visits and admission. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
