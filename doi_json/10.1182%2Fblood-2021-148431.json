    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Immune checkpoint blockade of programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligand (PD-L1) has contributed to efficacy in many tumor types, with clinical responses observed in a proportion of patients (pts) with Hodgkin lymphoma and rare non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes. A recent study demonstrated that combination treatment with anti-PD-L1 and anti-CD38 agents contributed to a stronger anti-tumor immune response compared with anti-PD-L1 monotherapy. Isatuximab, an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, is approved for use in multiple myeloma. Cemiplimab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, is approved for use in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. Methods: This Phase 1/2 open-label study (NCT03769181) was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of isatuximab in combination with cemiplimab (Isa+Cemi) in pts with relapsed and refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). The primary objectives of Phase 1 were to characterize the safety and tolerability of Isa+Cemi and to confirm the recommended Phase 2 dose. Phase 2 used a Simon's 2-stage design to assess the complete response rate in Cohort A1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1 na\u00efve cHL; n=18; median age, 36 years; 55.6% male; \u22652 prior regimens, 100%) and to assess the objective response rate in Cohorts A2 (cHL progressing after PD-1/PD-L1 therapy; n=12; median age, 33 years; 58.3% male; \u22652 prior regimens, 100%), B (DLBCL; n=17; median age, 64 years; 70.6% male; \u22652 prior regimens, 100%), and C (PTCL; n=11; median age, 69 years; 63.6% male; \u22652 prior regimens, 9.1%). Pts received Isa+Cemi for up to 96 weeks. In Phase 1, the isatuximab dose was 10 mg/kg every week (Cycle 1), every 2 weeks (Cycle 2-6), or every 3 weeks (Cycle 7+). The cemiplimab dose was 250 mg every 2 weeks (Cycle 1-6) or 350 mg every 3 weeks (Cycle 7+). An interim analysis was performed when the last pt in Phase 2 was followed up for 24 weeks. The efficacy evaluation was based on Simon's 2-stage design with 85% power at a 5% 1-sided alpha level for each cohort. At least 8 (44.4%) and 3 (30.0%) responses were required in Cohorts B and C, respectively, in Phase 2 Stage 1 to advance to Phase 2 Stage 2. Results: Isa+Cemi demonstrated a manageable safety profile with no new safety signals. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed, confirming the recommended Phase 2 dose. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 83.3% (Cohort A1) and 100% (Cohorts A2, B, C) of pts. Grade \u22653 TEAEs occurred in 5.6%, 8.3%, 70.6%, and 81.8% of pts in Cohorts A1, A2, B, and C, respectively. There were no pts in Cohorts A1 or A2 who reported TEAEs leading to definitive discontinuation; 5.9% and 27.3% of pts in Cohorts B and C experienced TEAEs leading to definitive discontinuation. No Grade 5 TEAEs with fatal outcome were reported in Cohorts A1 or A2. There were 4 deaths reported during the on-treatment period in Cohort B (progressive disease, n=2; intestinal perforation, n=1; urinary tract infection, n=1) and 2 in Cohort C (unknown, n=1; progressive disease, n=1). Infusion reactions were reported in 38.9%, 75.0%, 52.9%, and 72.7% of pts in Cohorts A1, A2, B, and C, respectively; there was 1 (9.1%) Grade \u22653 infusion reaction reported in Cohort C. Pharmacokinetics (PK) analyses suggested no effect of cemiplimab on isatuximab PK, and vice versa. Based on Lugano 2014 criteria, 55.6% (Cohort A1), 33.3% (Cohort A2), 5.9% (Cohort B), and 9.1% (Cohort C) of pts in the all-treated population achieved a complete or partial response. Median progression-free survival was 8.38 months (95% CI: 2.72-not calculable [NC]), 8.28 months (95% CI: 2.6-NC), 2.37 months (95% CI: 0.46-2.69), and 2.66 months (95% CI: 0.43-2.99) in Cohorts A1, A2, B, and C, respectively. Conclusion: In this study, Isa+Cemi had a manageable safety profile. Clinical efficacy was observed in pts with cHL, with increased responses observed in pts who had not previously received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy compared with those who progressed on anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. For Cohorts B (DLBCL) and C (PTCL), results of the interim efficacy analysis did not meet prespecified criteria to continue enrollment in Phase 2 Stage 2. Most pts with DLBCL were primary refractory/bulky and discontinued rapidly, which may have contributed to the lack of activity with this combination.

OffLabel Disclosure: Based on the Phase III ICARIA-MM study, isatuximab (Sarclisa) is approved in a number of countries in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Based on the Phase III IKEMA study, isatuximab in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone is approved in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy, and in the European Union for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. Cemiplimab (Libtayo) is an anti-PD-1 antibody approved for the treatment of the following: 1) patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation; 2) patients with locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma previously treated with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor or for whom a hedgehog pathway inhibitor is not appropriate; and 3) patients with NSCLC and high tumor PD-L1 expression as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 aberrations, and is locally advanced where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation or metastatic.",
