    "abstract_text": "Background Recently published data suggest that high doses of imatinib mesylate (IHD) (800 mg/daily) may be more effective than standard dose (400 mg/daily) in newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic phase CML. Furthermore escalating the dose of imatinib to 800 mg per day can overcome some cases of resistance to imatinib but tolerability of high-dose imatinib continues to be an issue. Aims To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin dosed twice daily (BID) for relief of musculoskletal and neuropathic pain associated with IHD. Methods 13 patients in chronic phase (CP) were enrolled because complained of severe, persistent pain, requiring nonoppioid analgesics. Patients were asked to quantify their pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS) (numeric range 0\u201310). QoL assessment was based on Therapy Impact Questionnaire. At baseline, the median pain-rate was 5 (range 3\u20138). Pts received pregabalin in doses ranging from 75 to 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. Results Despite a short study duration, a significant reduction was seen in weekly pain score (p < 0.0001), as well as VAS score (p < 0.0001) allowed pts to receive the scheduled dose of imatinib. Pregabalin was well tolerated, and the most common adverse event was only somnolence. The short study duration precluded the assessment of longer term safety issues such as weight gain. Conclusions Pregabalin was safe and effective in decreasing pain associated with high dose of imatinib, and also improved mood, sleep disturbance, and quality of life.",
