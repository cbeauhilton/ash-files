    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate the acetylation state of nucleosomal histones and represent a novel target in haematological malignancies. Inhibition of HDACs results in the induction of apoptosis in multiple myeloma (MM) and lymphoma (NHL) cells, associated with the down-regulation of signaling pathways involving IL-6 and IGF-1 and the inactivation of BCL-6. We have therefore investigated the activity of a novel hydroxamic acid HDAC inhibitor ( UCL67022 ) in comparsion with SAHA, alone and in combination with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Methods: HDAC activity in partially purified rat liver homogenate and intact CEM cells was determined using a fluorescent HDAC substrate. The human MM cell lines RPMI 8226/S and U266, and the NHL cell lines SUD-4, CRL, DOHH2, DHL-4, 5, 6, 7, GRANTA-519 and JEKO-1 were used to investigate effects on viable cell number using an ATP-dependent bioluminescence method. Activity against primary malignant cells from patients with MM, DLBCL, FL or CLL was also studied. Western blot analysis was used to investigate changes in acetylated histone-H3 and a-tubulin. Results: UCL67022 showed more potent HDAC inhibitory activity in liver extracts and whole CEM cells than SAHA (IC 50 0.05 vs 0.39uM in liver and 0.11 vs 0.33uM in CEM cells). UCL67022 was more potent than SAHA in reducing viable cell number in U266 (EC 50 0.14 vs 1.8 uM) and RPMI 8226/S (0.05 vs 0.78 uM) cells. Similarly NHL cell lines were 10\u201320 fold more sensitive to UCL67022 , with median EC 50 values of 0.05uM (range 0.03\u20130.10uM) vs 0.81uM, (range 0.68\u20131.28uM). In 2 primary MM samples UCL67022 showed increased activity with EC 50 values of 0.7uM and 0.11uM vs 12.2uM and 1.1uM for SAHA. 3 FL patient samples and 1 CLL sample were 3.7-fold more sensitive to UCL67022 than SAHA (median EC 50 4.7uM vs 17.5uM respectively). Western blot analysis showed a 10-fold difference in histone H3 acetylation between the two compounds, with acetylation returning to pre-treatment levels by 24hr with 3uM SAHA but remaining elevated out to 48hr with 0.3uM UCL67022 . Increased acetylation of a-tubulin confirmed the inhibition of HDAC6. Combination with bortezomib at 1, 2 and 4nM in MM cells showed increased antiproliferative activity with both SAHA and UCL67022 , with synergistic responses observed in the U226 cell line and in 1 primary sample and additive effects in the others. Conclusions: These data demonstrate the activity of the highly potent, novel HDAC inhibitor UCL67022 in MM and NHL cell lines and primary patient cells. Activity was increased in co-exposures with bortezomib possibly due to inhibition of HDAC6 and subsequent aggresome formation, suggesting a therapeutic advantage with the combination."
