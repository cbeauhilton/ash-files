    "abstract_text": "Background Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been a part of the standard therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and several studies showed double ASCT improved the outcome in comparison with single ASCT, especially the patients who failed to achieve very good partial remission (VGPR). Recently, the introduction of novel agents significantly improved the response rate of the treatment for the multiple myeloma. Although ASCT is still crucial for newly diagnosed myeloma patients, the role of the double ASCT is unclear in the era of novel agents. We performed a single institution-based retrospective study. Methods We reviewed the medical records of patients who treated with ASCT for multiple myeloma between January 2001 and April 2013 in National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. The regimen of the remission induction therapy, number of stem cell transplantations, survival after the first ASCT, progression free survival, the response after the induction therapy and the first ASCT were analyzed. Results Since 2001, we performed ASCT for 167 patients. Ninety-three patients were treated with double ASCT, and 2 patients were treated with tandem ASCT\u2013allogeneic SCT. In 127 patients were treated with vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone (VAD) as an induction therapy, and 40 patients were treated with bortezomib and dexamethasone (BD). Very-good-partial-remission (VGPR) or complete remission (CR) was obtained in 25.2%, 34.6% of the patients treated with VAD, and in 45.7%, 54.3% with BD regimen before and after the transplantation respectively. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) did not differ significantly between VAD and BD induction, the estimated 2 year-OS was 89.8% vs. 79.5%, and the 2 year-PFS was 43.2% vs. 63.5% respectively. Double transplantation improved PFS and OS in VAD induction than single transplantation (p=0.000, p=0.002). In BD induction, patients who failed to achieve VGPR or better after the first ASCT, double transplantation improved OS (p=0.010) but not PFS. In both VAD induction and BD, there was no significant survival benefit in double transplantation in patients who achieved VGPR or better. Conclusion The achievement of VGPR or better after the ASCT resulted in significantly better PFS. The role of double transplantation is still crucial for patients with inadequate response after the first ASCT even in the era of novel agents.
