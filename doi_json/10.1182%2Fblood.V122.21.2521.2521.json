    "abstract_text": "The Wilms\u2019 tumor oncogene protein (WT1) is an intracellular, oncogenic transcription factor that is over-expressed in a wide range of leukemias and solid cancers. RMFPNAPYL (RMF), a WT1-derived CD8 T cell HLA-A0201epitope, is a validated target for T cell-based immunotherapy. We generated a high affinity, fully human IgG1 mAb specific for the RMF/HLA-A0201 complex. The mAb shows potent anti-leukemia activity both in vitro and in vivo in mouse models. Bi-specific T cell engaging antibodies (BiTE) have been used effectively to target cell surface proteins and kill cancers. We have developed a new, potent form of the ESK mAb that is a bi-specific T cell engaging antibody (BiTE) specific for tumor cells coexpressing the intracellular oncoprotein, WT-1 and HLA A0201. ESK-BiTE and an irrelevant control BiTE were constructed with ESK1 scFv or irrelevant ScFv on one arm, and anti-CD3 ScFv fragment as the other arm. The BiTE constructs were expressed in CHO cells. Both the ESK-BiTE and the control BiTE bind human CD3 T cells. The ESK-BiTE selectively bind to leukemia cells that express both WT1 and HLA-A0201. The ESK-BiTE activated human resting T cells and EBV-specific T cells retargeting potent cytotoxicity against WT-1 + HLA A0201 + human leukemia cells in vitro. In an NSG mouse xenograft model, injection of ESK-BiTE (20 ug/ml) twice a week, following I.V. administration of 2x10 7 human EBV-specific T cells, once a week, significantly inhibited the growth of a previously established disseminated HLA A0201 + , WT-1 + human Ph + ALL, BV173 expressing luciferase, as measured by bioluminescence imaging. In a second NSG mouse model mice injected I.V. with an aggressive human AML, SET-2, on day 0, were treated on day 4 with ESK-Bite for 6 days consecutively at 20 ug/day together with EBV-specific T cells given twice a week. In this setting, the ESK-BiTE and T cells resulted in undetectable leukemic growth for 14 days post-leukemia inoculation, with a minimal tumor burden detected by day 18, while all control groups showed massive increases in leukemia burden by day 14. Mice bearing SET-2 leukemia, that received ESK-BiTE and T cells also showed longer survival and delayed limb paralysis. As expected, the human T cells, which were EBV-specific, did not induce signs of GVHD in mice. Our data provide evidence that ESK-BiTE is a potent and specific therapeutic agent against aggressive human leukemias expressing WT1 and HLA-A0201. This is the first study showing efficacy of a TCR-like BiTE antibody targeting an intracellular tumor antigen expressed at low density.
