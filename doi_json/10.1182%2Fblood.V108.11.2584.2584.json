    "abstract_text": "GX15-070 is a novel cycloprodigiosin derived small molecule BH3 inhibitor that binds with moderate affinity to all antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, including Mcl-1, and is currently undergoing Phase I clinical trials in leukemias. In this study, we investigated the activity of GX15-070 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary AML samples. GX15-070 inhibited cell growth of HL-60, U937, OCI-AML3 and KG-1 cell lines at IC 50\u2019s of 0.1, 0.5, 0.5 and 2.5\u03bcM, respectively, at 72 hours. Neither overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-X L nor loss of expression of Bax conferred resistance to GX15-070. GX15-070 inhibited Bim/Bcl-2 heterodimerization and induced association of activated Bak with Bax in OCI-AML3 cells, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation studies using CHAPS buffer. This was associated with cytosolic release of cytochrome c followed by an increase in annexin positivity, caspase activation and a decrease in mitochondrial inner membrane potential. Notably, GX15-070 induced cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria of leukemic cells. GX15-070 synergized with both AraC and the novel BH3 mimetic ABT-737 to induce apoptosis in OCI-AML3 cells, a notoriously chemoresistant cell line (GX15-070 and ABT-737 average CI value 0.3; GX15-070 and AraC average CI value 0.36). In 6/7 primary AML samples, GX15-070 induced apoptosis in CD34+ progenitor cells at an average IC 50 of 3.6\u00b11.2\u03bcM at 24 hours. GX15-070 potently inhibited clonogenic ability of AML blasts at sub-micromolar doses (58.5\u00b110.6% CFU-Blast at 0.1\u03bcM and 38.1\u00b110.5% at 0.25\u03bcM, n=7). In summary, BH3 inhibitor GX15-070 induces apoptosis in AML cells via inhibition of association of pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins and BH3-only proteins, followed by Bax/Bak activation and initiation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Hence, GX15-070 alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents may have utility in AML therapy."
