    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4314 Background: Emerging evidence demonstrates that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may originate from the bone marrow and are capable of being recruited to sites of ischemic injury and contribute to neovascularization. However, the identities of these bone marrow cells and the signaling pathways that regulate their differentiation into functional EPCs remain poorly understood. Methods and Results: We previously identified that among hematopoietic progenitor stem cells, common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) can preferentially differentiate into EPCs and possess high angiogenic activity under ischemic conditions compared to megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs). Herein, we identify that a TGF-\u03b21-responsive Kruppel-like Factor, KLF10, is robustly expressed in EPCs derived from CMPs and GMPs, compared to progenitors lacking EPC markers. KLF10\u2013/\u2013 mice have marked defects in circulating EPCs (\u201323.6% vs. WT, P <0.004). In addition, EPC differentiation and TGF-\u03b2 induced KDR responsiveness is markedly impaired (CMPs: WT 22.3% vs. KO 8.64%, P<0.0001; GMPs: WT 32.8% vs. KO 8.97%, P<0.00001). Functionally, KLF10\u2013/\u2013 EPCs derived from CMPs and GMPs adhered less to fibronectin-coated plates (CMPs: WT 285 vs. KO 144.25, P< 0.0004; GMPs: WT 275.25 vs. KO 108.75, P <0.0003) and had decreased rates of migration in transwell Boyden chambers (CMPs: WT 692 vs. KO 298.66, P<0.00004; GMPs: WT 635.66 vs. KO 263.66, P<0.00001). KLF10\u2013/\u2013 mice displayed impaired blood flow recovery after hindlimb ischemia (day 14, WT 0.827 vs. KO 0.640, P <0.009), an effect completely rescued by WT EPCs, but not KLF10\u2013/\u2013 EPCs. Matrigel plug implantation studies demonstrated impaired angiogenesis in KLF10\u2013/\u2013 mice compared to WT mice (WT 158 vs. KO 39.83, P<0.00000004). Overexpression studies revealed that KLF10 rescued EPC formation from TGF-\u03b21+/\u2013 CMPs and GMPs. Mechanistically, TGF-\u03b21 and KLF10 target the VEGFR2 promoter in EPCs which may underlie these effects. Background: Collectively, these observations identify that TGF-\u03b21 signaling and KLF10 are part of a key signaling pathway that regulates EPC differentiation from CMPs and GMPs and may provide a therapeutic target during cardiovascular ischemic states.
