    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2861 CD27, a lymphoid cell-specific TNFR superfamily member, is constitutively expressed on the majority of T cells, some NK cells and memory B cells. Through interaction with its ligand CD70, CD27 transduces a co-stimulatory signal promoting T cell and NK cell activation and cytotoxicity. In addition, CD27 is also expressed on many lymphoid-originated hematological neoplastic cells, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, thus being a potential direct target for antibody therapy. To generate potential antibodies for clinical development, we immunized human Ig transgenic mice and developed a panel of CD27 specific human mAbs. Clone 1F5 was identified as a lead based on its high affinity to both human and monkey CD27, enhanced co-stimulation of T cells, and ADCC of CD27-expressing lymphoblastic cell lines. Using SCID mice challenged with CD27-expressing human lymphoid cell lines, we demonstrated that 1F5 mediates conventional antibody effector function. Compared to human IgG1 isotype control (huIgG1), 1F5 at doses ranging 33 \u03bcg \u2013 500 \u03bcg (x 6) significantly delayed the growth of Burkitt's lymphoma Raji even when administration was initiated 1 week after tumor inoculation. Similar anti-tumor activity was observed against other CD27-expressing tumor lines including, Daudi and T-originated acute lymphoblastic leukemia CCRF-CEM. In order to investigate 1F5 in vivo agonistic activities and T cell-mediated tumor eradication, a human CD27 transgenic mouse model (hCD27-Tg) was generated and backcrossed onto C57BL/6 and BALB/c backgrounds. The expression profile and regulation of the human CD27 transgene driven by its own promoter were similar to that observed with endogenous mouse CD27. In addition to enhancing T cell responses when combined with vaccination, 1F5 treatment was highly effective against syngeneic mouse tumors including lymphoma BCL1 (BALB/c) and thymoma EL4-derived E.G7 (C57BL/6). For the BCL1 model, various dose levels of 1F5 mAb were delivered to mice intraperitoneally on days 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 after i.v. administration of 10 7 BCL 1 cells to huCD27 Tg and control animals. Controls including hCD27-Tg mice treated with saline or isotype control, or WT mice treated with 1F5 all performed consistently, leading to 50% survival approximately 23 days after tumor challenge. Treatment of mice with mAb, 1F5 substantially improved the 50% survival in a dose dependent fashion to >70 days post tumor challenge at the higher dose levels. Based on the promising efficacy data with anti-CD27 mAb 1F5 in immunocompromised and immunocompetent lymphoma models, a clinical grade product, referred to as CDX-1127 was manufactured and tested for safety. To assess the potential for 1F5 to mediate lymphocyte activation, we investigated its ability to induce proliferation and cytokine release from human PBMC or purified T cell cultures. Consistent with the known biology of CD27 we demonstrated the 1F5 mAb does not lead to direct activation of lymphocytes in the absence of additional signals. However, combining 1F5 with suboptimal levels of T cell receptor stimulation using anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3) was shown to enhance proliferation of human T cells. Two studies were performed using cynomolgus macaques. There were no CDX-1127 related mortalities or changes noted in the clinical condition, food appetence, body weights and body temperature, ophthalmic, electrocardiographic and clinical pathology assessments, organ weights and bone marrow assessments. In addition, there were no major differences in the percentage of lymphocyte populations between control and CDX-1127 treated animals at the end of the study demonstrating that the antibody did not significantly deplete normal CD27-expresssing cells. Based on the pre-clinical studies we are planning a Phase 1 clinical trial of CDX-1127 in patients with hematological malignancies and selected solid tumors. The trial is designed with separate arms to independently assess the safety and activity of CDX-1127 in hematologic malignancies, in which the antibody may act through multiple mechanisms, and in solid tumors where it would be fully dependent on indirect immune mechanisms.
