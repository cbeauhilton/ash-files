    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4660 Objectives: Menorrhagia is a common presentation of bleeding disorders, especially VWD in women. We decided to determine the frequency of these disorders in women with menstruation problems. Materials and Methods: 208 patients in reproductive age with menorrhagia were investigated for bleeding disorders in two steps. Step one includes CBC, PT, PTT and BT, which performed for all patients, and for patients who had an abnormality in step one, step two was considered. Step two includes VWAg, RCO, factors level, RIPA and platelet aggregometry. Results: Among 208 patients who investigated for bleeding disorders 53 patients (25%) had abnormalities in coagulation tests or platelet count. In our survey frequencies of bleeding disorder was VWD=14(6.73%), thrombocytopenia=13(6.25%), deficiency of factor II= 2(0.96%), factor V=1(0.48%), factor VII=3(1.44%), factor VIII=2(0.96%), Factor XI =4(1.92%), factor XII=4(1.92%), Bernard Soulier=2(0.96%). Furthermore, we found 18 patients (8.65%) who had abnormal PT, PTT or BT with no definite diagnosis. Conclusion: In this study, the most common bleeding disorder was VWD and thrombocytopenia ranked second disorders. Although other bleeding disorders are rare, in our study a number of them were found. So, we recomment the above coagulation test for women with menorrhagia.
