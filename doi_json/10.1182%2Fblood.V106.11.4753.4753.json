    "abstract_text": "Objective: We performed this prospective, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fludarabine-based regimes in the treatment of previously untreated and refractory, or relapsed, indolent non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL). Methods: Two fludarabine-based regimens were used in the clinical study. The FC regimen which consisted of fludarabine 50 mg/day, and cyclophosphamide 200 mg/day, intravenously, for 3 consecutive days, was given to the previously untreated patients. The FMD regimen which consisted of fludarabine 50 mg/day, intravenously, for 3 consecutive days, mitoxantrone 10 mg/m 2 , intravenously, on the first day, and dexamethasone 20 mg/m 2 /day, intravenously, for 5 consecutive days, was given to the relapsed and refractory patients. Results: Forty-seven indolent NHL patients (29 male and 18 female) were enrolled in this study from February 2003 to May 2005. The main disease subtypes were: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL; n = 25), follicular lymphoma (FL; n = 18), lymphoplasmic lymphoma (LPL; n = 3), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL; n =1). Overall response (OR) rate was 93.62%, and 44 of 47 patients achieved a response. The complete response (CR) rate was 63.83%, and 30 of 47 patients achieved a response. In the 16 previously untreated patients, the CR rate was 75.0% (n =12); the OR rate was 93.8% (n = 15). In the 31 relapsed and refractory patients, the CR rate was 61.3% (n =19) and OR rate was 93.5% (n =29). Median patient follow-up was 12 months (range, 1\u201327 months). The 12-month progression free survival (PFS) rates of previously untreated patients and relapsed or refractory patients were 93.3\u00b16.4% and 91.04\u00b16.1%, respectively; and the 18-month overall survival (OS) rates were 90.9\u00b18.67% and 90.32\u00b16.90%, respectively. Both regimens were well tolerated and the major toxicities were bone marrow suppression and gastrointestinal response. Conclusion: The FC and FMD regimens are effective and safe for indolent NHL patients.",
