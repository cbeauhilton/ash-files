    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3391 Introduction The anti-platelet factor 4(PF4)/heparin antibodies, arising as a result of previous heparin exposure, are causally related to the procoagulant state due to platelet and monocyte activation. Formation of these antibodies with subsequent thrombocytopenia or thrombosis has also been described in patients, who have not been previously exposed to heparin. The presence of anti-PF4/heparin antibodies in individuals correlates with the severity of periodontal disease, implying that their occurrence may be triggered by periodontal pathogens. In this study, we determined the presence of anti-PF4/heparin antibodies in gram-negative bacteremic patients in a hospital setting and propose a pathophysiologic mechanism of their presence. Method We developed an in house ELISA for quantifying anti-PF4/heparin antibodies using therapeutic heparin and PF4 isolated from platelets. We used serum from a patient with high optical density as a standard and assigned an unit of 100 arbitrarily to construct a standard curve. We tested the sera from gram negative bacteremic patients (n= 34) in the quantitative ELISA along with normal controls (n=10). We also developed an in house ELISA for studying cross reactivity between anti-PF4/heparin antibodies and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/PF4. We tested the sera from patients (n=5) with heparin induced thrombocytopenia in this cross reactivity ELISA. To test the interaction of LPS with PF4, we labeled PF4 with Alexa488 and measured its binding to LPS by monitoring the changes in fluorescence emission spectrum following excitation at \u03bb480. Results Patients with bacteremia had higher titers of antiPF4/heparin antibodies compared to normal controls (26.4 \u00b1 SD 33 units, N=34 versus 6.3 \u00b1 SD 2.38 units, N=10, P=0.032). Bacterial LPS interacted with alexa488-labeled PF4 in a concentration-dependent manner, as measured by the quenching of the excitation spectrum. Patients with ant-PF4/heparin antibodies also reacted with LPS/PF4 complex in ELISA. Prior absorption of serum with PF4/heparin complex coated on ELISA plates decreased the reactivity of the serum towards PF4/LPS complex (19\u201346%) in two out of the five patients tested suggesting some were cross-reaction between PF4/Heparin and PF4/LPS complex. Conclusions PF4 forms a complex with lipopolysaccharide and this complex is immunogenic. Antibodies to PF4/LPS complex can cross-react with PF4/heparin complex raising the possibility that these antibodies may be responsible for the detection of PF4/heparin in individuals never been exposed to heparin previously. These antibodies may also be at least partly responsible for increased thrombosis associated with infection. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
