    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3323 Background: YM150 is a potent oral direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor that is rapidly and extensively metabolized into YM-222714 after oral administration. YM-222714 predominantly determines the antithrombotic effect of YM150. Three studies were undertaken to assess the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profiles of YM150 and YM-222714 in healthy male subjects (aged 18\u201355 yrs) after single and multiple doses over a wide dose range. Methods: Study 1a was a sequential-group, double-blind (DB), randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation study (3, 10, 20 and 30 mg; n=6 per dose group, except for 30 mg, where n=5). Study 1b was an open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study to explore the effect of food on PK (n=10). Study 2 was a sequential-group, DB, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose escalation study (3, 10, 20 and 30 mg twice daily; n=6 per dose group); subjects received a single dose of YM150 (Day 1) followed by a washout period (48 h) and, thereafter, repeated dosing (Days 3\u201310). Study 3 was a sequential-group, DB, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose escalation study (60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 480 and 720 mg once daily; n=12 per dose group, except for 720 mg, where n=6); subjects received a single dose of YM150 (Day 1) followed by a washout period (48 h) and, thereafter, repeated dosing (Days 3\u20139). In all studies, blood samples were collected for PK/PD analysis up to 48, 72 or 96 hrs post-dose for 3\u2013120, 180\u2013480 and 720 mg dosages, respectively. All doses were tested separately in each study. Data are presented as arithmetic means. Results: YM-222714 maximum concentration (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) inf generally increased proportionally with dose in all studies. After single dosing across the studies (3\u2013720 mg), YM-222714 C max and AUC inf ranged from 103\u201313,550 ng/mL and 404\u201314,0793 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively; at steady state (SS), similar ranges were observed (C max : 116\u201318,680 ng/mL; AUC tau : 630\u201316,6009 ng\u00b7h/mL). The time to maximum concentration (t max ) of YM-222714 was 0.75\u20131.08 h after single dosing and at SS in Studies 1 and 2; in Study 3, t max slightly increased with dose (range for 60\u2013720 mg; single dose, 0.92\u20132.10 h; SS, 1.00\u20132.20 h). YM-222714 elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) was 14.3\u201320.0 h after single dosing and 14.3\u201320.5 h at SS. YM150 plasma concentrations were generally below the lower limit of quantification in Studies 1 and 2. In Study 3, YM150 C max and AUC inf increased proportionally with dose after single dosing (4.5\u201365.4 ng/mL and 197\u2013590 ng\u00b7h/mL), with a t 1/2 range of 12.5\u201317.9 h; consistent with this, YM150 C max and AUC tau also increased proportionally with dose at SS (6.8\u201390.0 ng/mL and 43.7\u2013723 ng\u00b7h/mL), with a t 1/2 of 16.2\u201322.3 h. Administration of YM150 10 mg in fed vs fasted state led to an increase in YM-222714 t max (1.7 vs 0.8 h) and decrease in C max (253 vs 310 ng/mL); other parameters were similar in both states. Small amounts of YM150 (<0.65%) were excreted unchanged in urine after single dosing and at SS; 20\u201340% and 25\u201339% of dose was excreted as YM-222714 after single dosing and at SS, respectively. Across the studies, renal clearance (CL R ) ranged from 1.60\u20132.91 L/h after single dosing; a similar range was observed at SS (1.37\u20132.57 L/h). Across studies (YM150 3\u2013720 mg) maximum prothrombin time (PT max ; INR) increased with dose and was similar under single dosing (1.42\u201314.1) and at SS (1.48\u201314.3), as was maximum activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT max ; single dose, 37.0\u201381.6 s; SS, 38.0\u201392.4 s). A dose-dependent decrease in FXa activity was observed that was similar after single dosing and at SS (60\u2013720 mg; 58.0\u201328.1% and 50.7\u201322.3%, respectively). Treatment with YM150 was generally safe and well tolerated across all studies. Conclusions: YM150 is rapidly and extensively converted to YM-222714 after oral administration. YM-222714 demonstrated a predictable, dose-proportional PK profile that was similar under single dosing and SS conditions, including a linear increase in C max and AUC, consistent t 1/2 and no dose effect on CL R ; no relevant food effect was observed, with administration of YM150 in fasted or fed state, having minimal effects on YM-222714 PK. Additionally, YM150 exhibited dose-dependent antithrombotic activity, as shown by increasing PT and aPTT and decreasing FXa activity with dose.
