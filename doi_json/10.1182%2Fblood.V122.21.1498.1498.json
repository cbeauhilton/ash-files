    "abstract_text": "Background The efficacy and safety of subsequent TKIs in pts who have experienced failure of dasatinib is not fully known. Ponatinib, a pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor, was evaluated in a phase 2, international, open-label clinical trial (PACE). This post-hoc analysis explored the efficacy and safety of ponatinib following failure of dasatinib in CP-CML pts in the PACE trial. Methods The PACE trial enrolled 449 pts, including 270 with CP-CML. Pts had to be resistant or intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib, or they had to have the T315I mutation at baseline. The primary endpoint in CP-CML was major cytogenetic response (MCyR) at any time within 12 months after treatment initiation. The trial is ongoing. Data as of 1 April 2013 are reported, with a minimum follow-up of 18 months for pts remaining on study. The efficacy and safety of ponatinib (45 mg QD) in 107 CP-CML pts following failure of dasatinib as the most recent prior therapy, irrespective of other TKI therapy, is presented (Group D). Eighteen pts who experienced failure of dasatinib but received \u22651 anticancer therapy, other than hydroxyurea or anagrelide, prior to ponatinib treatment were excluded from the analyses. Data are also presented for 2 subsets of Group D: 52 pts whose only TKI therapy was imatinib followed by dasatinib (Group I-D), and 46 pts whose only TKI therapy was imatinib, then nilotinib, and then dasatinib (Group I-N-D). An analysis of cross-intolerance was also conducted in 69 pts with prior dasatinib treatment at any time who discontinued dasatinib due to intolerance. Results Baseline characteristics are shown in the table. Group I-D tended to be younger, with less time since diagnosis versus Group I-N-D. At the time of analysis, 60%, 65%, and 54% of pts in Groups D, I-D, and I-N-D remained on study. The most common reasons for discontinuation were adverse events (AEs; 16%, 15%, 17%) and progressive disease (9%, 6%, 11%) in Groups D, I-D, and I-N-D. Efficacy end points are shown in the table. In Group D, MCyR was seen in pts with the following dasatinib-resistant mutations at baseline: V299L, 3/4 (75%); T315I, 17/23 (74%); F317L, 3/10 (30%). The most common treatment-related AEs were thrombocytopenia (44%, 37%, 57%), rash (39%, 39%, 39%), and dry skin (39%, 29%, 52%) in Groups D, I-D, and I-N-D. Serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular AEs occurred in 6%, 3%, and 3% of pts in Group D (treatment-related: 3%, 1%, 0%). Seventy-three of 217 pts receiving prior dasatinib at any time discontinued dasatinib due to intolerance. Of these 73 pts, 27 experienced the same AE(s) with ponatinib that led to dasatinib intolerance; 12 pts had grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, 6 pts had other grade 3/4 AEs (3 with neutropenia, 1 each with pleural effusion, dyspnea, pulmonary hypertension), 8 pts had grade 1/2 AEs. Six of these 27 pts discontinued ponatinib due to the same AE that led to dasatinib intolerance. Thrombocytopenia was the primary AE involved in cross-intolerance (4 pts); congestive cardiac failure (grade 5) and pleural effusion each occurred once. Conclusions Ponatinib has substantial activity in pts with CP-CML following failure of dasatinib, with a safety profile reflective of this heavily pretreated population. Cross-intolerance between dasatinib and ponatinib was infrequent. Table  . Group D N=107 . Group I-D n=52 . Group I-N-D n=46 .
