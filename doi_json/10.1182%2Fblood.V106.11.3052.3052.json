    "abstract_text": "Chimeric receptors (chRecs) combining extracellular recognition domains with the T cell receptor \u03b6 an redirect the cellular immune response of primary T-cells to tumor cells. T cell activation by chRec induces efficient cytokine release and cytotoxicity, however, it fails to mediate proliferative responses, limiting the usefulness of chRec-gene-modified T cells for adoptive immunotherapy of cancer. Inclusion of a CD28 costimulatory signaling component in the chRec endodomain enhances antigen-specific proliferation. Whereas the signal mediated by ligation of CD28 is of crucial importance for the activation of resting CD4+ T cells, further molecules with costimulatory functions have contributory roles. NKG2D is a stimulatory receptor that was first identified in NK cells, but is also expressed in cytotoxic T cells and positively modulates CD8+ T cell immune responses. We hypothesized that inclusion of the NKG2D-associated signaling domain DAP10 would enhance the capacity of chRecs to induce tumor-specific activation and proliferation of in vitro expanded effector T cells. Based on a G D2 -specific scFv, we generated chRecs containing either the DAP10 signaling chain alone (14.G2a-DAP10) or combined with TCR\u03b6 14.G2a-DAP10\u03b6), and expressed them in nonspecifically activated human peripheral blood T cells of three individual donors by retroviral gene transfer. As controls, T cells were transduced with 14.G2a-\u03b6 and -CD28\u03b6 chRec. High chRec surface expression was obtained with all four constructs (55\u00b111%, \u03b6; 85\u00b13, CD28\u03b6; 68\u00b15%, DAP10; 78\u00b11%; DAP10\u03b6). Immunophenotypes were dominated by a CD3+CD8+ population in all cell cultures. Whereas DAP10 alone failed to mediate specific tumor cell lysis, 51 Cr release assays revealed efficient and comparable lysis of G D2 + tumor targets by T cells transduced with all \u03b6-containing constructs, with 49\u00b18% (\u03b6), 52\u00b17% (CD28\u03b6), and 52\u00b118% (DAP10\u03b6) cytolysis at an effector-to-target ratio of 40:1. Intracellular cytokine secretion by chRec+ T cells was induced in response to tumor targets by 14.G2a-\u03b6 (up to 37% IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells), CD28\u03b6, and DAP\u03b6 (both up to 22%), but not by DAP10 alone (0,2%). Weekly stimulation with tumor cells for 6 weeks induced only limited expansion of T cells transduced with 14.G2a-\u03b6 (7\u201345fold) or with 14.G2a-DAP10 (14\u201326-fold). Adding CD28 or DAP10 domains significantly enhanced expansion by a comparable degree (270\u2013483-fold and 126\u2013436-fold, respectively). Thus, while neither CD28 nor DAP10 enhances antigen-specific cytokine secretion and cytolysis, DAP10 signaling can completely replace CD28 signaling in costimulating antigen-specific proliferation of peripheral blood T cells. DAP10-containing chRec may be a powerful new tool for adoptive immunotherapy of cancer.",
