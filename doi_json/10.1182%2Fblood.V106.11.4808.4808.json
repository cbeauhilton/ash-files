    "abstract_text": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) is a key player in cell growth signaling in a number of lymphoid malignancies including myeloma and primary effusion lymphoma. However, its role in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has not been elucidated. Therefore, we have studied the PI3-kinase pathway and apoptosis in a panel of DLBCL cell lines (SUDHL4, SUDHL8, SUDHL10 and OCI-LY19). Our data show that inhibition of PI3-kinase by a specific inhibitor, LY294002, induced apoptosis as detected by Annexin V/Propidium Iodide dual staining in the majority of DLBCL cell lines. We then dissected the PI3-kinase pathway by analyzing the downstream targets of phosphorylation by Western blot. We found that AKT/PKB was constitutively phosphorylated, and thus activated, in all DLBCL cell lines. The downstream elements of AKT, ForkHead (FKHR) and GSK3 were also constitutively phosphorylated in all DLBCL cell lines. Similarly, treatment with LY294002 prevented this phenomenon in all the cell lines regardless of their final apoptotic endpoint. Inhibition of PI3-kinase activity further downstream induced cleavage of Bid in all DLBCL cells and subsequently loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in all DLBCL cell lines. The release of cytochrome C led to activation of Caspases 9 and 3 and cleavage of PARP. Finally expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis, XIAP, which is also a downstream target of AKT, was compromised in the all cell lines following LY294002 treatment. Our data demonstrate that the PI3-kinase pathway plays a major role in the survival and growth of DLBCL cells. Altogether, these results suggest that blocking the PI3-kinase pathway may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.",
