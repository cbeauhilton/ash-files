    "abstract_text": "Germline mutations in the RNA Helicase gene DDX41 cause inherited susceptibility to Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). These mutations are always heterozygous and are typically frameshifts, causing loss of protein expression. We recently reported that at least one functional copy of DDX41 is essential for hematopoiesis, and that DDX41 is required for ribosome biogenesis. While biallelic DDX41 mutations cause dramatic defects in hematopoiesis, the role of heterozygous mutations in Myelodysplastic Syndrome pathogenesis is not yet understood. Recent clinical studies have pointed out that some patients bearing germline DDX41 mutations have idiopathic cytopenias of unknown significance (ICUS) prior to MDS onset, suggesting that underlying hematopoietic defects precede and potentially contribute to the onset of MDS/AML (Choi et al., Haemotologica 2021). It has also been noted that the majority of DDX41-mutant MDS patients have refractory anemia, indicating that the erythroid lineage is particularly effected in these patients (Sebert et al., Blood 2019). Since ribosome defects are a common cause of inherited anemias and also contribute to MDS pathogenesis, we characterized the effect of heterozygous DDX41 mutations on erythropoiesis in murine and human models. Mice that have been transplanted with Ddx41 +/- bone marrow develop anemia at 12-15 months post-transplant, indicating that detection of erythroid defects in vivo is aging-dependent. We characterized the effect of heterozygosity of Ddx41 on erythroid progenitor function in vitro and found that Ddx41 +/- bone marrow from young mice yields fewer BFU-E in colony assays but comparable numbers of myeloid colonies. Liquid culture erythroid differentiation of Ddx41 +/- bone marrow produces fewer CD71+ Ter119+ progenitors than controls. To characterize the effect of heterozygous DDX41 mutations on human erythropoiesis, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells bearing heterozygous frameshift mutations in DDX41 using CRISPR. We found that these DDX41 +/- iPSC lines produced CD43+/CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) with equal efficiency as unmodified control iPSC. However, once these HPC were induced to differentiate down the erythroid lineage in liquid culture, they made fewer CD71+ GLYA+ erythroid progenitors and fewer hemoglobinized cells. The DDX41 +/- HPC also produced fewer BFU-E in colony assays. Mechanistically, we found that the in vitro-derived erythroid progenitors from both mice and human iPSC had decreased protein translation, suggesting that ribosome defects underlie the observed erythroid differentiation defects. In diseases such as Diamond Blackfan Anemia and Dyskeratosis Congenita, ribosome defects lead to p53 activation which reduces cell cycle progression in erythroid progenitors. To test the role of p53 in the erythroid defects caused by Ddx41 heterozygosity, we crossed Ddx41 +/- mice with p53-knockout mice and found that loss of p53 fully rescued the BFU-E colony formation of Ddx41 +/- bone marrow HPC. We confirmed this finding using CRISPR-mediated knockout of p53 in Ddx41 +/- BM HPC. Collectively, these results suggest that a mild ribosome defect in DDX41 +/- HPC causes a deficit in erythropoiesis that results in anemia with aging. It is likely that this anemia causes stress in the bone marrow and a selective environment in which malignant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells arise, leading to MDS and AML.
