    "abstract_text": "Autologous HCT (autoHCT) salvages many patients (pts) with relapsed lymphomas but few relapsing after an autoHCT are cured. We determined feasibility of stem cell collection, engraftment kinetics, treatment-related mortality (TRM), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) for a second autoHCT (HCT2) for lymphoma relapsing after prior HCT (HCT1). We studied 35 pts, 20 with HL and 15 with diffuse or follicular large cell and immunoblastic NHL, receiving a HCT2 for relapse between 1986 and 2003 and reported to the CIBMTR. Median (range) age at HCT2 was 36 yrs (16\u201361); 61% had a performance score less than 90. HCT2 was performed >1 year after HCT1 in 80%. Median (range) time from diagnosis to HCT1 was 20 mo (4\u2013162 mo), from HCT1 to relapse, 17 mo (3\u201368 mo), and from relapse to HCT2, 5 mo (1\u201340 mo). 83% underwent a 2 nd stem cell / marrow harvest prior to HCT2. Median time to ANC >0.5 x 10 9 /L was 11d. CBV or BEAM were the conditioning regimens for HCT1 in 80% and for HCT2 in 60%. The best response to HCT2 was complete remission in 22 pts and partial remission in 5; 8 pts had either no response or progressive disease. At a median follow up of 92 mo (32\u2013124 mo) after HCT2, 26 pts (74%) have died with 17 (65%) dying of relapsed lymphoma. Two (6%) patients developed therapy-related MDS. The probability of TRM at day 100 was 12% (95% CI, 3\u201325%). The 1, 3 and 5 yr probability of PFS were 45% (95% CI, 29\u201362%), 33% (95% CI, 18\u201350%) and 30% (95% CI, 15\u201346%), respectively. The 1, 3 and 5 yr probability of OS were 63% (95% CI, 46\u201378%), 34% (95% CI, 19\u201350%) and 31% (95% CI, 17\u201347%), respectively. There were no differences in outcomes between HL or NHL. Pts relapsing >6mo after HCT1 appeared to have better OS (fig 1 and 2). In summary, HCT2 is feasible in pts with lymphoma after relapsing an HCT1. Stem cells harvested prior to HCT2 resulted in rapid engraftment with a day 100 TRM (12%) lower than that reported for alloHCT in this setting. Relapse is the primary reason for failure, but approximately one-third of pts enjoy long-term disease free survival. HCT2 should be considered for young pts with relapsed HL or NHL post-HCT1 without alternative transplant options. . HCT1 (%) . HCT2 (%) .
