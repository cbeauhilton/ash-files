    "abstract_text": "Background : Tumor-intrinsic molecular features informing risk and resistance mechanisms in large-B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) treated with CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) are lacking. TP53 has been implicated in aberrant apoptosis signaling and immune evasion. We hypothesized that TP53 -alterations are detrimental in LBCL treated with CD19-CAR-T. Methods : Patients with relapsed/refractory LBCL treated with CD19-CAR-T were included. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) encompassing protein-coding exons of over 400 genes (MSK-IMPACT) was performed on pre-CAR-T tumor samples in a subset of patients. Response and survival rates by tumor-intrinsic histological, cytogenetic, and molecular markers were assessed. Interactions between genomic aberrations and cellular pathways that could contribute to CAR-T resistance were studied using publicly available datasets with genomic and transcriptomic profiling. Results: We included 136 adults with LBCL treated with CD19-CAR-T. (axicabtagene-ciloleucel [70, 51%], tisagenlecleucel [38, 28%], lisocabtagene-maraleucel [28. 21%]). Patients were heavily pre-treated (\u22654 treatment lines [58%]) and primarily categorized as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)-NOS (79%) followed by double/triple hit high-grade lymphoma (12%). DLBCL transformed from follicular lymphoma, high KI67-index, germinal center B-cell cell of origin, and double expressor phenotype were highly represented (43%, 47%, 50%, and 40%, respectively). Outcomes in the complete cohort echoed pivotal trials: best overall response rate 78% (Fig. A), median overall survival (OS) 22.7 months (95%CI 14.8-NR), median progression-free survival 6.2 months (3.3-12.3). A subset of 76 patients had tumor NGS profiling. Clinical features and CR and OS rates were similar across patients with and without NGS. TP53 genomic alterations were common (28, 37%). A total of 26 TP53 mutations (22 missense; 2 in-frame deletions; 2 splice sites) were identified in 23 patients. An additional five patients had TP53 homozygous deletions (i.e., copy number alterations). Two patients had concurrent TP53 mutations and homozygous deletions. Among tumor-intrinsic factors, only TP53 -alterations were predictive of complete response (CR) in univariable and multivariable logistic regression; no association was observed with histological and cytogenetic features (Fig. B). TP53-alterations were also predictive of OS in univariable and multivariable Cox regression (Fig. C-D; 1-year OS in TP53 -altered (48% [95% CI 32 - 71]) vs. wild-type (75% [64 - 89]), p = 0.039). Notably, in TP53 -altered LBCL, axicabtagene-ciloleucel therapy was associated with superior OS compared to aggregated 41BB products (HR 3.40 [1.19-9.66]) in multivariable Cox regression adjusted for age, performance status, and primary refractory disease (Fig. E). Transcriptomic analysis of publicly available samples from newly diagnosed LBCL patients (n=562) demonstrated that TP53 -alterations are associated with dysregulation of pathways related to CAR-T cell cytotoxicity, including downregulation of interferon and death receptor pathway genes, and reduced CD8 T-cell tumor infiltration (Fig. F-H). Conclusions : We show, for the first time, that TP53 alterations are a valuable prognostic and potentially predictive marker in LGBL CD19-CAR-T recipients. Gene expression profiling suggests that TP53 alterations result in an immunosuppressive tumor-microenvironment and impaired apoptosis signaling, which could lead to decreased CAR-T efficacy.
