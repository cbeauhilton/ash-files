    "abstract_text": "Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) have been implicated in platelet activation downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ITAM-bearing receptors, as well as integrins. Among the multiple PI3K isoforms expressed in platelets, PI3K\u03b3 and PI3K\u03b2 are considered to be involved in GPCRs-mediated signaling leading to Rap1b activation and cell aggregation. However, a definitive genetic analysis of the relative contribution of PI3K\u03b2 versus PI3K\u03b3 in the different contexts of platelet activation has not been provided yet. PI3K\u03b3 knockout mice have been widely investigated, but PI3K\u03b3 has been recognized to mediate also kinase-independent effects. Moreover, deletion of p110\u03b2 is embryonic lethal, and thus PI3K\u03b2 knockout platelets have not been previously available for analysis. Knockin mice carrying a kinase dead form of either PI3K\u03b2 or PI3K\u03b3 have been recently generated by introducing K833R mutation in p110\u03b3, or K805R mutation in p110\u03b2, respectively ( Patrucco et al, Cell  2004 : 118 , 375 ; Ciraolo et al, 2008, in press). In this study, we have compared platelet activation in mice homozygous for the kinase dead forms of PI3K\u03b2 (PI3K\u03b2 KD ) or PI3K\u03b3 (PI3K\u03b3 KD ). Platelet count and tail bleeding time were not altered in either PI3K\u03b3 KD or PI3K\u03b2 KD mice. Platelet aggregation induced by the thromboxane A 2 analogue U46619, which stimulates GPCRs, was only slightly reduced in PI3K\u03b3 KD platelets, and was not further inhibited by treatment with the selective PI3K\u03b2 inhibitor TGX221. Accordingly, catalytic inactivation of PI3K\u03b2 caused only a modest reduction of platelet aggregation induced by U46619. Similar results were also obtained upon stimulation of GPCRs for ADP or thrombin. ADP- and U46619-induced activation of the small GTPase Rap1b, a key regulator of platelet aggregation, was only reduced in PI3K\u03b3 KD , but was almost completely suppressed in PI3K\u03b2 KD , pointing to a major role for this isoform in the GPCRs-mediated regulation of the GTPase. Rap1b was normally activated upon stimulation of PI3K\u03b3 KD platelets with the GPVI ligand convulxin (CVX), both in the absence and presence of the ADP scavenger apyrase. Moreover, CVX-induced aggregation of PI3K\u03b3 KD platelets was only slightly reduced. By contrast, PI3K\u03b2 KD platelets completely failed to aggregate in response to a wide range of concentrations of CVX, and accumulation of active GTP-bound Rap1b was almost undetectable. Accordingly, the PI3K\u03b2 inhibitor TGX221 completely suppressed both Rap1b activation and aggregation induced by GPVI stimulation in either wild type or PI3K\u03b3 KD platelets, both in the presence and absence of apyrase. PI3K\u03b3 KD platelets adhered normally to immobilize type I collagen or fibrinogen, and displayed only a small defect of spreading on fibrinogen. Similarly, adhesion to collagen was comparable in PI3K\u03b2 KD and wild type platelets. However, PI3K\u03b2 KD revealed a severely impaired adhesion to fibrinogen. In addition, adherent cells completely failed to spread, and virtually no lamellipodia-forming platelets were observed. Altogether these results indicate both PI3K\u03b3 and PI3K\u03b2 are both involved in Rap1b activation and platelet aggregation upon stimulation of GPCRs, but provide the first genetic evidence that PI3K\u03b2, rather than PI3K\u03b3, plays an essential role in platelet activation downstream of the ITAM-bearing receptor GPVI, as well as in integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 outside-in signaling."
