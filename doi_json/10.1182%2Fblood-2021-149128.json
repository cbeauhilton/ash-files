    "abstract_text": "Background: Despite the changing landscape of treatment of chronic lymphoma leukemia (CLL) and in contrast to the large number of quality of life (QoL) and psychosocial studies in patients with solid tumors, relatively few studies have reported QoL in patients with CLL. This study aims to assess depression, anxiety, stress and QoL in a Chinese CLL cohort. Patients and Methods: Taking advantage of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 accompanying CLL-specific module QLQ-CLL17 questionnaire and DASS-21 questionnaire, a total of 50 Chinese patients with CLL completed self-reported questionnaires from December 2019 to July 2021, assessing the level of depression, anxiety, stress and QoL. Results: Among the 50 CLL patients, 34 patients were male. The median age was 57 (22-77) years old. 66% of the patients were uncertain about the staging of the disease. 36% of the patients were uncertain about therapeutic implications of CLL. According to EORTC QLQ-C30, patients had low level of physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning and social functioning were 80%, 32%, 68%, 66%, 64%, respectively. Patients in active-treatment group had significantly lower level of physical function than \"watch and wait\" group (90% vs. 65%, P=0.03). The proportion of patients with cognitive problems was significantly higher in female patients than in male patients (93.8% vs. 52.9%, P=0.004). According to QLQ-CLL17, patients with symptom burden, physical condition and worries about health were 94% (47/50), 86% (43/50), 98% (48/50). Patients under 60 years old had higher scores for worries about health than patients older than 60. According to DASS-21 questionnaire, 86% of the patients had depression symptomatic scores (mild grade: 2%, medium grade: 52%, severe grade: 20%, very severe grade: 12%). 84% of the patients had anxiety symptomatic scores ( mild grade: 6%, medium grade: 14%, severe grade: 30%, very severe grade: 34%). 64% of the patients had stress symptomatic scores ( mild grade: 18%, medium grade: 22%, severe grade: 16%, very severe grade: 8%). And these psychosocial issues had no significant correlation with gender, age, household income and treatment . The same questionnaires were completed by 5 patients for the second time after median 8\uff082-18\uff09months. Compared to the initial assessment, they scored significantly worse on the emotional scales (P=0.0237). No significant difference regarding physical functioning, role functioning, cognitive functioning and social functioning were observed between the former and the latter. Conclusions: The majority of CLL patients had impaired QoL and psychosocial issues. Active-treatment patients had worse physical condition than \"watch and wait\" patients. Male patients had better cognitive functioning. Younger patients had more worries about health than the elderly. Greater efforts should be made in management of CLL patients.
