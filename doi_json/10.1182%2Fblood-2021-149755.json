    "abstract_text": "Introduction Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder caused by \"antiphospholipid\" antibodies (aPL) directed against \u03b22-glycoprotein I (\u03b22GPI). Although \u03b22GPI is proposed to have both anti- and procoagulant properties in vitro, its physiological role in coagulation in vivo is not well understood. Previous studies have shown that \u03b22GPI deficient mice display impaired thrombin generation but failed to demonstrate an anticoagulant role in vivo. Recent findings from our laboratory demonstrated that \u03b22GPI-deficient mice ( APOH -/- ) developed by CRISPR/Cas9 had shown delayed time to thrombosis as evidenced by prolonged clotting times in carotid artery occlusion models. However, no mechanism was identified for the delayed time to thrombosis phenotype. Methods Venous thrombosis by complete occlusion of the IVC was performed as described previously (Wrobleski et al., 2011). In brief, an abdominal incision was made on anesthetized mice to visualize IVC. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT); prothrombin time (PT) and Tissue factor-induced thrombin generation time (TGT) were performed as described previously (Stavrou et al., 2014). Protein C activity was performed according to manufacturer's recommendations (Chromogenix Coamatic\u00ae Protein C, Diapharma). To assess platelet activation, platelets were isolated under resting conditions using retro-orbital blood and the final washed platelet pellet was resuspended in Tyrodes solution. Platelets were stimulated with 0.25 U/ml thrombin and incubated with 1 \u00b5L of CD62P-FITC or Oregon Green conjugated-fibrinogen for 30 minutes. Platelets were fixed with 100 \u03bcL 2% formalin, and quantification of platelet surface P-selectin and fibrinogen binding to activated platelet GPIIb/IIIa was performed by flow cytometry (Accuri Flow Cytometer, BD Biosciences). For mouse tail vein bleeding time assays, mice were anesthetized and the tail transected approximately 5 mm from the tip. The tail was then placed in a 50 ml falcon tube containing saline pre-warmed to 37\u00b0C. The time to cessation of bleeding was determined visually. All experiments were performed on 8-12 week old mice. Results aPTT and PT results for APOH +/+ and APOH -/- mice were 41.82 \u00b1 1.174 and 41.38 \u00b1 2.026 seconds, and 14.55 \u00b1 2.262 and 11.30 \u00b1 0.578 seconds, respectively (NS). After IVC ligation, thrombi in APOH -/- mice had a mean weight of 16.94 \u00b1 1.782 mg compared to 27.69 \u00b1 1.725 mg in APOH +/+ mice littermates (P = 0.0002, Figure A). Thrombin generation induced by either tissue factor or aPPT reagent showed peak thrombin generation at 15 min with no difference between APOH +/+ and APOH -/- mice. Likewise, no significant differences were observed in percent Protein C activity levels between APOH +/+ (8.058 \u00b1 1.433) and APOH -/- (6.453 \u00b1 0.924). Stimulation with 0.25 U/ml thrombin resulted in significantly greater expression of P-selectin) on platelets of APOH +/+ (161.3 \u00b1 30.62 MFI) compared to those from APOH -/- mice (54.47 \u00b1 9.721 MFI) (P= 0.0101;Figure 1B). Likewise, there was significantly greater fibrinogen binding to stimulated platelets from APOH +/+ (129.7 \u00b1 32.21 MFI) compared to APOH-/- mice (35.30 \u00b1 2.144 MFI) with P = 0.0111 (Figure 1C). Finally, consistent with platelet activation studies, tail vein bleeding times were mildly, but significantly prolonged in APOH -/- mice (192.3 \u00b1 45.86 sec) compared to APOH+/+ mice (95.14 \u00b1 9.582 sec) with P = 0.. Conclusion The effects of \u03b22GPI, if any, on coagulation processes is controversial, and has not been thoroughly studied in \u03b22GPI deficient animals. The results presented here suggest that the smaller thrombi that form in mice deficient in \u03b22GPI following IVC occlusion may reflect a mild platelet function defect. This hypothesis is supported by diminished P-selectin expression and fibrinogen binding in response to 0.25 U/ml thrombin by platelets from \u03b22GPI deficient mice compared to wild-type littermates. Moreover, tail vein bleeding times were mildly prolonged in \u03b22GPI deficient mice. Taken together, these studies suggest that \u03b22GPI may actually contribute to hemostasis by supporting platelet responses to low concentrations of thrombin. Additional studies are needed to characterize these effects in detail.
