    "abstract_text": "Waldenstr\u00f6m Macroglobulinemia (WM) is a proliferative disorder of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the lymph nodes and bone marrow. Phenotypically, WM cells are CD19+, CD20+, CD22+, CD38+, CD138+/- and are lymphoid or plasmacytic in morphology. The disease is characterized by abundant secretion of monoclonal, IgM which causes much of morbidity associated with WM. The disease carries a high prevalence of activating somatic mutations in MyD88 (91%) and CXCR4 (28%), which have been shown to contribute to poor prognosis. These mutations involve signaling cascades that activate pathways known to enhance survival signaling including Bcl-x L . Generally, upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins is observed as cancer cells break differentiation and proliferation checkpoints. To counter this, it becomes necessary for the cell to increase expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins making it dependent on a particular protein or set of proteins for survival. However, we have previously shown data that Bcl-2 family expression in WM is characterized by low expression of both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. To investigate a mechanism for this regulation, we examined the Bcl-2 family expression in three WM cell lines and observed that in two lines, BCWM.1 and MWCL-1, the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bim was expressed at very low levels or absent, respectively, which corresponded with low sensitivity to inducers of Bim-dependent intrinsic apoptosis including ABT-737 and dexamethasone. These cell lines were sensitive to bortezomib which can induce apoptosis independent of Bim via a tBid-dependent mechanism. In the third WM cell line, RPCI-WM1, Bim was expressed at moderate levels but the pro-apoptotic proteins Bak and Bax were underexpressed and absent, respectively, which rendered the cell line completely apoptosis-deficient. Having ruled out genomic copy number variation at the loci corresponding to these genes and finding no evidence of epigenetic silencing by methylation, we examined the expression of microRNAs targeting these genes. We first examined the predicted targets of seven commonly dysregulated microRNAs in WM. Of these only one, miR-494, was found to have a moderately conserved target site in the 3\u2019 UTR of Bim. However, the expression pattern of miR-494 did not correlate with the pattern of Bim expression in the WM cell lines. None of these microRNAs were predicted to target Bax or Bak. Therefore, we examined the expression of the remaining commonly dysregulated microRNAs and found that miR-155 was expressed at much higher levels in BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 than in RPCI-WM1 or the multiple myeloma (MM) cell line MM1.s. miR-155 is known to both directly and indirectly regulate FOXO3a, a transcription factor important in the induction of Bim. Confirming this, we observed low protein expression of FOXO3a in both BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 cells. To test this mechanism we stably expressed an anti-miR that targets miR-155 or a control anti-miR in all three WM cell lines and observed an increase in mRNA for FOXO3a and Bim as well as an increase in Bim protein in BWCM.1 and MWCL-1 cells expressing anti-miR-155, while no effect on Bim was observed in the RPCI-WM1 line that does not express miR-155 at high levels. This corresponded with a two-fold increase in ABT-737-induced apoptosis in both BWCM.1 and MWCL-1 in the absence of any additional death signal. As expected, miR-155 antagonism did not significantly increase bortezomib-induced apoptosis. These data indicate that miR-155 expression raises the apoptotic threshold in WM by limiting FOXO3a-mediated Bim expression. Cancer therapy relies on the ability to kill malignant cells at a lower dose than would kill healthy cells. This therapeutic index relies heavily on what is termed mitochondrial priming which is a measure of the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins in a cell. The malignant cell remains alive due to sequestration of these proteins by anti-apoptotic proteins, yet requires less death signaling to cause release of sufficient quantities of pro-apoptotic proteins to activate apoptosis. The data presented here indicate that increased expression of miR-155 raises the apoptotic threshold of WM cells by inhibiting Bim expression and thereby compromises the therapeutic index of many agents. Therefore, the sensitivity to a variety of apoptosis-inducing therapies would be increased by targeting miR-155 in combination as part of the treatment modality.
