    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1134 Ligand binding to integrins mediates cell adhesion and transmits \u201coutside in\u201d signals that lead to cell spreading, migration, and proliferation. In platelets, the prototype integrin aIIbb3-mediated outside-in signaling is required for platelet spreading and retraction, and greatly amplifies platelet activation. Previous studies suggest that phosphoinositide 3-Kinases (PI3K) are activated upon binding of integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 to its ligand fibrinogen, and is important in outside-in signaling leading to platelet spreading. However, the mechanism by which PI3K transmits outside-in signals has been unclear. A major known downstream effector of PI3K is the Akt (protein kinase B) family of serine/threonine kinases, including Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3. We have recently shown that platelets not only express Akt1 and Akt2 as previously reported, but also express a substantial amount of Akt3. To investigate whether Akt3 is a downstream effector mediating PI3K-dependent integrin outside-in signaling, platelets from Akt3 knockout mice were compared with wild type platelets for their spreading on fibrinogen. Platelets from Akt3 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed partially, but significantly reduced spreading on fibrinogen, indicating that Akt3 is important in integrin-mediated outside-in signaling leading to platelet spreading. Consistent with the results of Akt3 knockout, treatment of platelets with a pan Akt inhibitor also significantly inhibited spreading of human and mouse platelets on fibrinogen. Akt becomes phosphorylated upon platelet spreading on fibrinogen, which is significantly reduced in Akt3 knockout platelets, and is abolished by PI3 Kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, or Src Family Kinase (SFK) Inhibitor, PP2, suggesting that Akt activation is downstream from PI3K, and SFK during integrin outside-in signaling. Thus, our data reveals that Akt3 is an important downstream effector of PI3K-dependent integrin outside-in signaling promoting platelet spreading.
