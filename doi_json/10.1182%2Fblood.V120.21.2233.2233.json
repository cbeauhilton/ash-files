    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2233 Baxter has developed a new recombinant factor IX (rFIX) product (BAX 326) for treating patients with hemophilia B. The aim of the presented studies was to evaluate the function, safety and efficacy of BAX 326 compared to a commercially available rFIX regarding differences in activated FIX (FIXa) content. The FIXa concentration of BAX 326 was about 10 fold less than that of a commercial rFIX product. To address the influence of FIXa on functional FIX in vitro assays, the FIXa concentration of BAX 326 was increased. Samples were analyzed by one-stage clotting assay, non-activated partial thromboplastin time assay and thrombin generation assay. In all three assays, FIXa affected the potency determination for FIX, indicating that rFIX products should preferentially contain a low FIXa content. The thrombogenic potential of BAX 326 was assessed in rabbits using a modified Wessler Test at 750 IU/kg (10-fold human clinical dose). No thrombogenic potential was observed with BAX 326 (individual scores of 0), whereas the mean score for the commercially available rFIX was 0.5. After increasing the FIXa concentration of BAX 326 to equalize it with the commercially available rFIX, a mean score of 0.42 (individual scores 0 \u2013 0.5) was determined. These data strongly suggest that the differences in preclinical thrombogenicity were caused by the higher FIXa content of the commercially available rFIX, thereby confirming earlier findings [1]. Efficacy of the rFIX products was studied in hemophilia B (FIX ko) mice that received prophylactic treatment with 75 IU/kg of BAX 326 or the commercially available rFIX. Treated animals were analyzed in two primary pharmacodynamic models: a carotid occlusion model and one using thrombelastography. In both models, results for the two groups were similar, demonstrating that despite its lower FIXa content, BAX 326 was as efficacious as a commercially available rFIX at 75 IU/kg (p<0.0076).
