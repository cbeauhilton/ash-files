    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3120 Poster Board III-57 Recently we reported that cobalt chloride-simulated hypoxia and mild hypoxia could induce the differentiation of human acute myeloid leukemic (AML) cells probably through hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1a) independent of its transcription activity. In this study, we used differential gel electrophoresis to compare the HIF-1\u03b1a regulated proteins between conditional induction and absence of HIF-1\u03b1a protein in U937T cells. Among all the up-regulated proteins indentified, the mRNA and protein level of galectin-1 was most remarkably changed. Knockdown of galectin-1 partially blocked the differentiation induced by HIF-1\u03b1a overexpression in U937T cells as assessed by morphological criteria and differentiation associated-antigens. Notably, reduced expression of C/EBP\u03b1a, a critical transcription factor for granulocyte differentiation, could inhibit the up-regulation of galectin-1 induced by HIF-1\u03b1a, and inducible expression of C/EBP\u03b1a in U937T cells also increased galectin-1 expression. Furthermore, by using the luciferase assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation we localized the binding site of C/EBP\u03b1a in the promoter of galectin-1. Finally the role of galectin-1 during chloride-simulated hypoxia and mild hypoxia was addressed by decreasing the expression of galectin-1 with small interfering RNA. Taken together, these results conclude that galectin-1 is required for hypoxia triggered C/EBP\u03b1a dependent AML cell differentiation. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
