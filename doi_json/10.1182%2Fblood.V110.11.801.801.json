    "abstract_text": "CD37 is a lineage-specific B-cell antigen highly expressed on both normal and transformed B-cells. The significant B-cell selective CD37 expression makes it a valuable target for therapy against B cell malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and non-Hodgkins lymphoma (B-NHL). A novel CD37-specific small modular immunopharmaceutical (CD37 SMIP ) was engineered to contain a single chain variable region (scFv) linked to a human IgG 1 hinge, CH 2 and CH 3 domains. CD37 SMIP induces potent apoptosis in the presence of a crosslinker and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against primary CLL cells. Significant in vivo therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated in a SCID mouse xenograft leukemia/lymphoma model that is dependent upon NK cell function. The induced cytotoxicity in primary CLL cells was independent of activation of caspase cascade, and consistent with this, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk failed to rescue CD37 SMIP drug induced cytotoxicity. In an attempt to define the CD37 mediated early signaling events and their role in cytotoxicity, we investigated protein tyrosine phosphorylation as a potential early activation event responsible for CD37 SMIP drug mediated cytotoxicity. Primary B CLL cells were stimulated with increasing concentration of CD37 SMIP with or without crosslinker. Western blot analysis of cellular lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed several tyrosine phosphorylated proteins including a predominant \u223c65KDa protein in response to the cross-linking of CD37 SMIP within 10 minutes. Further, pre-treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of the predominant 65KDa protein and inhibited CD37 SMIP induced apoptosis in a dose dependent manner. Attempts to identify the tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and to define the potential role of these target proteins in the apoptotic pathway are ongoing. To further examine the molecular mechanism whereby CD37 SMIP triggers cell death, we investigated the involvement of mitochondrial pathways including changes in mitochondrial potential (\u0394\u03c8m) and generation of reactive oxygen species. Treatment with CD37 SMIP induces a time dependent mitochondrial membrane depolarization and increased production of ROS. Further, primary B CLL cells cultured with CD37 SMIP induced cleavage and mitochondrial translocation of Bax and upregulation of Bim in a time dependent manner indicating a potential role for Bim and Bax pro apoptotic proteins in CD37 induced apoptosis. These findings provide strong justification for CD37 as a therapeutic target aimed at modulation of pro apoptotic proteins and introduce small modular immunopharmaceuticals as a novel class of targeted therapies for B-cell malignancies.
