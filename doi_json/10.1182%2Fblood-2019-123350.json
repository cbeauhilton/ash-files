    "abstract_text": "Intro - Agents targeting the apoptosis pathway, like the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax, are highly effective in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, not all patients experience deep responses and acquired resistance has already been described. T cell mediated lysis is another tool currently exploited in hematologic malignancies. In contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) however, efficacy of autologous based T cell therapy, such as CAR T cells, in CLL has been low. This is linked to a CLL mediated acquired T cell dysfunction. Bispecific T cell engagers targeting CD19 are successfully applied in ALL, but whether it overcomes the acquired T cell dysfunction in CLL is unknown. We therefore tested efficacy of a CD3xCD19 Dual Affinity Re-Targeting molecule (DART) in CLL. Since it has been observed that bispecific antibodies can overcome deficient synapse formation in CLL (Robinson et al, 2018) and based on our assumption that T cell mediated lysis differs from venetoclax-mediated killing, we hypothesized that usage of a CD3xCD19 DART in CLL overcomes T cell dysfunction and will be effective against venetoclax resistant CLL. Methods - Co-culture of CLL derived or aged-matched healthy donor (HD) CD4 + and/or CD8 + T cells with (CD40 activated) primary CLL or CD19 + cell lines JeKo-1 or Ramos in presence of CD3xCD19 (JNJ-64052781), CD3xFITC, anti-CD3/28 antibodies was performed. R esults - JeKo-1 cells were highly sensitive to CD3xCD19 mediated HD T cell killing with close to 70% of lysis in a concentration of 10ng/mL using an E:T ratio of 4:1. In the same conditions, primary CLL cells proved sensitive for CD3xCD19 mediated HD T cell killing with 50% of lysis. Killing was observed irrespective of IGHV mutation or chemorefractory status. We next compared HD with CLL-derived T cells by measuring activation levels between direct TCR (anti-CD3/CD28) and CD3xCD19 stimulation. As described, TCR stimulation resulted in impaired CLL CD4 + and CD8 + T cell activation and proliferation when compared to HD. In contrast, treatment of CLL derived PBMCs with CD3xCD19 did not resulted in dysfunctional CLL-derived T cell responses (Fig 1A-C). Consistently, co-culture of CLL derived CD4 + , CD8 + or a combination with either JeKo-1 or allogeneic CLL cells in the presence of CD3xCD19 resulted in significant cytotoxicity (Fig. 1D). In the allogeneic setting, cytotoxic capacity of CD4 + T cells was similar to their CD8 + counterparts. When targeting autologous CLL, a benefit was observed when both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were present (Fig. 1D). We then studied whether venetoclax resistant CLL cells could be targeted by CD3xCD19 mediated T cell killing. Bcl-2 overexpressing Ramos were equally lysed in presence of the CD3xCD19 DART as their wildtype counterpart, indicating that Bcl-2 expression does not inhibit CD3xCD19 mediated cell death. Following CLL cell stimulation by CD40 ligation, anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL, Bfl-1 and Mcl-1 are highly induced (Thijssen et al., 2015) resulting in venetoclax resistance (Fig 1E). Nevertheless, CD40L stimulated CLL cells were as efficiently lysed upon CD3xCD19 treatment as unstimulated CLL. (Fig 1F). This indicates that an augmented apoptotic threshold does not impact efficacy of CD3xCD19. Further examination of the mechanism of CD3xCD19 mediated killing showed that lysis depended on granzymes, as blocking granule exocytosis prevented cell death. Independence of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was shown by equal sensitivity to CD3xCD19 mediated T cell lysis comparing BAX/BAK knockout Jeko-1 cells to the parental cell line. Also, caspase blockage did not inhibit cell death, pointing to apoptosis independent killing. In concordance, PARP cleavage could only be detected when caspase activity was not blocked. Conclusion - This is the first report describing reversal of CLL mediated T cell dysfunction by applying a CD3xCD19 DART. Furthermore, it shows that venetoclax resistant CLL can still be efficiently targeted by T cells, in a non-apoptotic fashion. These results imply that T cell mediated therapy could be used alongside venetoclax.
