    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1430 Background. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) degrades tryptophan (TRP) into kynurenine (KYN) and other immune suppressive molecules. The IDO1-driven production of KYN promotes the development, stabilization and activation of regulatory T cells (Treg), while suppressing effector T cells, all of which may contribute to immune system impairment in cancer-bearing individuals. It has been previously shown that IDO1 mRNA and protein are detectable in blast cells from 52% of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in correlation with expanded Treg cells. Importantly, high copy numbers of IDO mRNA may be a negative independent predicting variable for overall and relapse-free survival in adult AML. Patients and methods. We investigated IDO1 expression and function in 21 children with acute leukemia [10 AML (median age 13 years, range 6\u201316), 9 B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL, 1 infant acute leukemia with MLL rearrangement and 1 T-cell ALL] and in 1 patient with Ph + chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Amongst patients with AML, 3 children had secondary AML, 3 patients had core-binding factor (CBF) + AML, 3 patients had FLT3-ITD + AML and 1 patient had AML with t(6;9). TRP and KYN levels were measured with reverse phase (RP)-HPLC. Results. Cells from either BCP-ALL or T-cell ALL expressed IDO1 neither constitutively nor after challenge with 100 ng/ml interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, a prototypical inducer of IDO, whereas they up-regulated both phosphorylated STAT-3 and surface programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), an IFN-\u03b3-inducible co-inhibitory receptor also implicated in tumor-induced immune evasion. By contrast, leukemia blast cells from 5 out of 10 AML and from Ph + CML up-regulated IDO1 protein expression after in vitro challenge with IFN-\u03b3 (median 20-fold increase, range 11.9\u2013120, compared with unstimulated AML cells). KYN levels significantly increased in supernatants of AML cells treated with IFN-\u03b3 for 72h (10.8 \u03bcM/L, range 8.15\u201320.5) compared with unstimulated cultures (1.4 \u03bcM/L, range 1.1\u20132.2), in parallel with TRP consumption (6.3 \u03bcM/L, range 3.0\u201314.1, after challenge with IFN-\u03b3 compared with 18.2 \u03bcM, range 13.7\u201320.9, in unstimulated cultures). The IFN-\u03b3-induced increase of IDO expression was significantly inhibited by pre-treatment of leukemia cells with STAT3 inhibitors (median 1.95-fold compared with unstimulated AML cells, range 0.9\u201327.7), but not with STAT5 inhibitors. In line with these results, STAT3 inhibition prevented the IFN-\u03b3-induced release of KYN in culture supernatants. Western blot runs of immuno-precipitated proteins with specific antibodies suggested a physical interaction between IDO and STAT3 in IFN-\u03b3-challenged leukemia blasts, but not in unstimulated samples. In a mixed tumor cell lymphocyte culture (MTLC), AML blasts primed with IFN-\u03b3 significantly inhibited Th1 cytokine production by allogeneic CD8 + T cells, while enhancing IL-4 release by CD4 + T cells. These effects were potentiated by the supplementation of MTLCs with exogenous KYN. The intracellular levels of IL-17A were unaffected by the exposure of allogeneic T cells to AML blasts. The addition of D,L-1-methyl-tryptophan (1MT), an IDO inhibitor, to the co-cultures of T cells and AML blasts incompletely restored IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8 + T cells. By contrast, STAT3 inhibitors fully reverted the AML-induced skewing of IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 secretion. Conclusions. Blast cells from a subset of childhood AML, but not those from BCP-ALL or T-cell ALL, express functional IDO1 and restrain IFN-\u03b3 secretion by CD8 + T cells, while enhancing IL-4 production by CD4 + T cells. From a therapeutic standpoint, STAT3 inhibitors may effectively interfere with IDO1 expression by AML cells, thus tipping the Th1/Th2 balance in favor of anti-leukemia immune responses.
