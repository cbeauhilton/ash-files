    "abstract_text": "All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is one of the first line agents in differentiation therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, drug resistance becomes a major problem which influences the efficacy of ATRA. Mechanisms of ATRA resistance are ugly needed to be identified. Here we found that expression of C/EBP\u03b1, an important transcription factor for myeloid differentiation, was significantly suppressed in ATRA resistant APL cell line NB4-R1 compared with ATRA sensitive NB4 cells. Moreover, two forms of C/EBP\u03b1 were unequally suppressed in NB4-R1 cells. Suppression of the full-length form P42 was more pronounced than the truncated form P30. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was also observed in NB4-R1 cells. Meanwhile, C/EBP\u03b1 expression was reduced by PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and mTOR inhibitor RAD001 in NB4 cell, suggesting that inactivation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was responsible for C/EBP\u03b1 suppression in APL cells. Then, we restored C/EBP\u03b1 P42 and P30 by lentivirus vectors in NB4-R1 cells respectively, and found C/EBP\u03b1 P42, but not P30, could increase CD11b, CD14, G-CSFR and GM-CSFR expression, which indicated the occurrence myeloid differentiation. Moreover, further upregulating of CD11b expression and differential morphological changes were found in NB4-R1 cells with restored C/EBP\u03b1 P42 after ATRA treatment. However, CD11b expression and differential morphological changes could not be induced by ATRA in NB4-R1 cells infected with P30 expressing or control vector. Thus, we inferred that ATRA sensibility of NB4-R1 cells was enhanced by restoration of C/EBP\u03b1 P42. In addition, we used histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin (TSA) to restore C/EBP\u03b1 expression in NB4-R1 cells. Similar enhancement of myeloid differentiation and cell growth arrest were detected. Together, this study demonstrated that suppression of C/EBP\u03b1 P42 induced by PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition impaired the differentiation and ATRA sensibility of APL cells. Restoring C/EBP\u03b1 P42 is an attractive approach for differentiation therapy in ATRA resistant APL. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
