    "abstract_text": "The 6 nucleotide insertion-deletion polymorphism (-6526N del) in the CASP8 promoter has been demonstrated to destroy an Sp1 binding site, resulting in reduced caspase-8 activity and expression and a reduced susceptibility of 652 6N del/del T-lymphocytes to undergo apoptosis in response to anti-FAS and to tumour infiltrating lymphocytes. As the susceptibility of T-lymphocytes to undergo apoptosis could affect outcome following allogeneic HSCT we have investigated the impact of the CASP8-652 6N del polymorphism in both donors and recipients on the outcomes of patients undergoing unrelated donor HSCT. Genotyping was performed on 186 donor/recipient pairs who underwent an HSCT from a donor from the Anthony Nolan Trust in one of 25 transplant centres in the United Kingdom between 1997 and 2006. All patients were transplanted for a haematological malignancy and had long term clinical data collated. Diagnoses were CML: 40.3%; MDS: 4.3%, ALL: 16.6%; AML: 23.6 %, lymphoproliferative disorders: 10.4 %, multiple myeloma: 4.8%. The frequency of the 3 genotypes in the Caspase 8 promoter region was as follows: RECIPIENTS: WT/WT=0.26; WT/del=0.49; del/del=0.24 and DONORS: WT/WT=0.33; WT/del=0.40; del/del=0.25. Frequencies in both the donor and recipient populations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Our findings show that the overall survival (OS) in recipients who received a transplant from a donor with a WT/WT genotype was significantly better as compared to donors with WT/del or del/del genotype (52% v 34% at 5 years; p=0.03). The disease free survival (DFS) at 3 years was also significantly better (39% v 18%; p=0.03). In addition, we found a significant reduction in grade II-IV acute GVHD (17% v 30%; p=0.04) and a trend towards lower incidence of chronic GVHD (42% v 63%; p=0.06) and transplant related mortality (TRM) (19% v 35%; p=0.06) in these patients. No significant difference in disease relapse was seen. The results were particularly striking in the subgroup of recipients where one or two deletions were present (WT/del or del/del genotype). The OS was 62% in those who received a graft from a donor with WT/WT genotype compared to 36% with other donors (p=0.01). This remained significant in multivariate analysis (HR 0.53; CI 0.29, 0.98; p=0.04). This subgroup also had a lower risk of relapse (p=0.02). In this cohort, the majority (156/186) of recipients had in-vivo T-cell depletion using Alemtuzumab. As Alemtuzumab depletes T-cells in part by apoptosis induced via a caspase 8 dependent pathway, we hypothesize that recipients who receive a transplant from a donor with WT/WT genotype are likely to get more effective T-cell depletion and hence less acute GVHD and reduced TRM resulting in improved survival. The mechanism of interaction between donor and recipient genotypes remains to be explored. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure "
