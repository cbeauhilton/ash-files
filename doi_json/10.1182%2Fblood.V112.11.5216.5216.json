    "abstract_text": "Purpose: This study assessed the safety, tolerability, and response rate of bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone and/or doxorubibcin in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Methods: Botezomib was administered 1.3mg/m 2 on days 1, 4, 8, 11 of a 28-day cycle. Intravenous dexamethasone was administered 20\u201340mg/d on day 1\u20132, 4\u20135, 8\u20139,11\u201312, and 5 patients were also given 20mg/d doxorubibcin on day 1\u20134. Results: Thirty relapsed or refractory myeloma patients (table 1) were enrolled; two patients could not be evaluated because they were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining patients 19 are male, 9 are female. Median age of the patients were 61(49\u201378). Median number of prior therapies was 4 (1\u201311). 22 of 28 patients who had been evaluated were assessable for response according to the EBMT criteria (European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria). One CR(3.6%), twelve immunofixation-positive CRs[nCR] (42.9%), six PRs(21.4%), and three MR (10.7%) were observed. All patients who had an objective response were alive as of this analysis. Nine patients died during follow-up. Mean response time (time to best response)for the 28 patients was 25 days. Most common Grade \u22653 toxicities (table 2) were peripheral neuropathy(3/28), thrombocytopenia (3/28), rash(one in 28 patients). Six patients(21.4%) suffered herpes after one or two cycles.
