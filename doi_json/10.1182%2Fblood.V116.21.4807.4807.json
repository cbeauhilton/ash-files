Association of pica and sickle cell disease (SCD) are poorly documented. Alerted by parents, we decided to verify systematically a) the occurrence of pica in SCD children b) to determine its duration, c) to identify the substances commonly ingested and d) to determine the characteristics among children and adolescents with SCD who reported practicing pica. Methods: SCD patients were seen in the outpatient clinic at the University Children's Hospital Queen Fabiola at Brussels between May 1, 2010 and July 30, 2010 as part of their regular follow-up. Data on sex, age, weight, height, body mass index, sickle cell phenotype, G6PD deficiency as well as biological data such as hematocrit mean corpuscular volume, fetal hemoglobin, plasma iron, zinc, copper, lead levels were recorded from their medical chart. Parents and patients were interviewed for the presence of eating disorders. Children and care givers completed questionnaires assessing symptoms of pica. Patients with acute illness, pregnancy, developmental delay, cognitive impairment or age younger than 3 years were excluded. Student t-test was used for difference in mean values groups by pica presence or absence. Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical variable. Difference in means values were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Results: Fifty-Five patients (24 males and 31 females) with a median age of 8. 9 years (6. 7\u2013 11. 3) were evaluated during the study period. Forty-five patients (81.8%) originate from Central Africa, 10.9% (6/55) from West Africa, 1.8 %(1/55) from respectively East Africa, Italy and 3.6% (2/55) have mixed origin. Fifty \u2013two (94.5%) patients are homozygous for Hb S (Hb SS), 3 are SC and 1 has S\u03b2\u00b0 thalassemia. Thirty-one patients (56.4%) reported an history of pica and during the study period 29.1% (16/55) reported practicing pica regularly. The mean age of patient with pica was 7. 4 years significantly lower than non-pica patients (p  0.05) ( Table 1 ). Iron status was identical. Lead overload was absent in the entire cohort. Hemolytic phenotype assessed by LDH was identical in both group and mild zinc deficiency was present in both groups. We did not observe difference due to hydroxyure\u0301e intake (p>0.05) Conclusion: In our study, pica appeared to have a very high prevalence in SCD children and adolescents. However, its etiology is still unknown. Except lower age and significant lower hematocrit value in pica patients when compared to non-pica ones, no differences in iron status, zinc deficiency or hematological parameters was found. The general health status evaluated by BMI was identical in both groups and the trend to more boys in the pica group is not significant. Further studies are necessary to establish the etiology of pica and its possible consequences on SCD. Table 1 Clinical and biological characteristics of patients  VARIABLES . NON PICA (n = 16) .
