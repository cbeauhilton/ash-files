    "abstract_text": "Carcinoembryonic antigen associated cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM-1) belongs to a family of carcinoembryonic antigen-associated glycoproteins. It is expressed on leukocytes, endothelium, and epithelium. Microarray analysis showed that CEACAM-1 mRNA is increased in the small bowel during gut graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). Using CEACAM-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice as recipients or sources of donor bone marrow or T cells caused significantly worse GVHD mortality (p<0.05) compared to wildtype (WT) controls. Histopathological analysis of GVHD target organs from CEACAM-1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients of WT T cells or WT recipients of CEACAM-1 \u2212/\u2212 T cells revealed increased GVHD of the large bowel (p<0.05) but not liver or small bowel compared to WT control. Alloreactive splenic CD8 CEACAM-1 \u2212/\u2212 T cells from recipients with GVHD had increased levels of \u03b14\u03b27 integrin compared to WT controls. We also found increased numbers of small bowel intraepithelial lymphocytes and mesenteric lymph node cellularity in CEACAM-1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients of WT T cells and WT recipients of CEACAM-1 \u2212/\u2212 T cells, with a corresponding decrease of cellularity in peripheral lymph nodes and the liver. Adoptive transfer of CFSE hi CEACAM-1 \u2212/\u2212 T cells into WT hosts, or of WT T cells into CEACAM 1 \u2212/\u2212 hosts revealed more profound activation of T cells in CEACAM-1 deficient settings, shown by increased early CD25 expression and CD62L down-regulation on splenic CFSE dim alloreactive T cells. We found no significant differences in serum levels of TNF or IFN\u03b3, T cell proliferation kinetics upon adoptive transfer, percentages of alloactivated CD4 or CD8 cells, intracellular levels of T-bet or IFN\u03b3, CD8 T cell cytolytic efficiency, percentages of splenic regulatory T cells, or levels of T cell apoptosis in WT recipients of CEACAM-1 \u2212/\u2212 T cells or CEACAM-1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients of WT T cells with GVHD as compared with controls. Finally, irradiation of non-transplanted CEACAM-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice revealed increased radiation sensitivity, shown by earlier and greater lethality and increased small bowel crypt apoptosis, suggesting a role for CEACAM-1 in conditioning-related toxicity and subsequent GVHD amplification. We conclude that CEACAM-1 deficiency on donor T cells or transplant recipients results in increased gut and systemic GVHD due to increased T cell activation and elevated expression of the gut homing integrin \u03b14\u03b27. This suggests that the use of CEACAM-1 agonists could be a novel theraputic strategy for ameliorating acute intestinal and systemic graft-versus-host-disease."
