    "abstract_text": "RNA-guided Cas9 nucleases based on the prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas systems provide an unprecedented ease in being able to edit the genomes of diverse organisms. As a single unifying factor capable of co-localizing RNA, DNA, and protein, I believe tools and techniques based on Cas9 will grant exquisite control over cellular organization, regulation, and behavior. Here I will describe work on development of the CRISPR-Cas9 targeting methodology, and detail current and prospective genome-engineering methodologies.
