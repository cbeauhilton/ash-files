    "abstract_text": "Imatinib mesylate (IM) is an inhibitor of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein associated with human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). IM therapy has shown remarkable effects in initial clinical trials, but both clinical and laboratory studies increasingly suggest that, on its own, IM may have limited curative potential, due to a reduced IM sensitivity of the more primitive, slowly proliferating CD34 + CML cells thought to be responsible for sustaining the disease in vivo. To investigate the basis of this unresponsiveness, we compared the IM sensitivity and BCR-ABL expression of FACS-purified subsets of lin \u2212 CD34 + cells from 4 CML chronic phase patients. None of these had been treated with IM and their cells at all stages of differentiation were exclusively leukemic; i.e., >95% of the lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 \u2212 , lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 + and lin + CD34 \u2212 cells were BCR-ABL + (by direct FISH) and all longterm culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) -derived CFCs were Ph + . In the absence of IM, suspension cultures initiated with these lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 \u2212 CML cells (0.5\u20135% of the lin \u2212 CD34 + cells) showed a net expansion of viable cells after 3 weeks; 100x with and 10x without added growth factors (GFs). Addition of 0.1\u201310 \u03bcM/ml IM reduced the yield of viable cells in a dose-dependent fashion, particularly when GFs were not added (100-fold decrease with 10 \u03bcM/ml IM). Parallel cultures of the corresponding lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 + CML cells showed these did not expanded as much (~8x +GFs, 2x -GFs) and were more sensitive to IM (1000-fold decrease after 3 weeks in 10 \u03bcM/ml IM -GFs). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed BCR-ABL transcripts to be present in the most primitive, freshly isolated lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 \u2212 cells (n=12) at >300-fold higher levels than in the terminally differentiating lin + CD34 \u2212 CML cells (n=21), at >10-fold higher levels than the normal BCR transcripts in the same lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 \u2212 cells, and at 40-fold higher levels than in the less primitive lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 + cells (n=12), indicating a correlation between decreasing BCR-ABL transcripts and increasing IM sensitivity during CML stem cell differentiation in vivo. Interestingly, maintenance of the lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 \u2212 CML cells for 3 weeks in vitro with 10 \u03bcM/ml IM (\u00b1GFs) consistently selected for a subset of leukemic cells (80\u2013100% BCR-ABL + by FISH) that showed complete resistance to 5 \u03bcM/ml IM in CFC assays, in marked contrast to the CFCs in the starting lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 \u2212 cells that were inhibited 5\u201310-fold by 5 \u03bcM/ml IM. Moreover, although the Ph was the sole abnormality present in all direct metaphases, initial CFCs and LTC-IC-derived CFCs from all samples, a 17p+ abnormality was seen in 4/4 metaphases obtained from one colony generated from the cells present in one of the 3-week IM-containing cultures, suggesting the selective survival of differentiating progeny of rare, pre-existing, IM-resistant stem cells. Consistent with this possibility was the finding that BCR-ABL transcript levels in the cells present in the 3 week cultures were reduced 50-fold relative to the input lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 \u2212 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest a previously undescribed epigenetic mechanism of IM unresponsiveness characteristic of chronic phase CML stem cells, in addition to the silent accumulation of genetically-determined IM-resistant members as the CML stem cell population expands during the development of the chronic phase of the disease.",
