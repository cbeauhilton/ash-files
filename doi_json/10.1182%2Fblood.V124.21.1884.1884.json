    "abstract_text": "Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) including myelofibrosis (MF) are characterized by chronic hyperactivation of a signaling axis downstream of the JAK2 kinase. Pharmacologic inhibitors of JAK2 ameliorate constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly in MF patients. However, these agents do not appear to be capable of eradicating the malignant clone, nor have they have been shown to prevent transformation to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). These findings suggest that aberrant activation of additional signaling pathways, either downstream of JAK2, or via alternative mechanisms, may contribute to MPN pathogenesis. To develop more effective therapeutic strategies, a fuller understanding of these altered signaling pathways in MPNs is needed. Mass cytometry is an innovative technology that enables the characterization of dysregulated signaling networks at the single cell level. We utilized this approach to examine intracellular signaling phenotypes of seven MF patients, five sAML patients, and five normal controls across two independent experiments. Patient CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) frequently exhibited basal (unstimulated) signaling abnormalities suggestive of chronic hyperactivation of the JAK-STAT, MAP kinase/PI3 kinase, and NF\u03baB signaling pathways. HSPCs from individual patients also exhibited hypersensitive responses to stimulation by the cytokines thrombopoietin (TPO), G-CSF, and/or TNF\u03b1. Elevated phosphorylation of the signaling molecules AKT, ERK, CREB, and S6 suggests an extensive network of hyperactivated signaling in MF and sAML HSPCs. Evidence of NF\u03baB signaling hyperactivation was identified as indicated by (1) elevated phosphorylation of the NF\u03baB subunit p65/RELA and supranormal abundance of I\u03baB\u03b1 in unstimulated cells; and (2) hypersensitive responses to TNF\u03b1, in the form of TNF\u03b1 stimulated p65/RELA phosphorylation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. Pronounced NF\u03baB signaling hyperactivation was observed in a subset of MF and sAML patients from these experiments. Elevated NF\u03baB signaling was predominantly insensitive to ex vivo exposure to the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, but was partly sensitive to the I\u03baB kinase inhibitor IKKiVII. The relevance of NF\u03baB signaling to myeloproliferation was tested by colony-forming unit (CFU) assays with MF patient HSPCs. IKKiVII inhibited myeloid colony formation from MF CD34+ cells with a potency similar to that observed for ruxolitinib. Inhibition of colony formation by IKKiVII was enhanced in combination with ruxolitinib. Similarly, growth of the JAK2 mutant HEL cell line was inhibited by IKKiVII with a potency similar to that observed for ruxolitinib, and the combination of IKKiVII and ruxolitinib gave substantially greater inhibition than either inhibitor alone. This suggests that NF\u03baB signaling may be an important component of myeloproliferation, particularly in the context of hyperactive JAK2. These findings suggest that co-targeting of JAK2 and NF\u03baB could be beneficial therapeutically. Ongoing experiments are focused on further characterizing the extent of dysregulated signaling in MPNs, as well as the prevalence of hyperactive NF\u03baB signaling in MF and sAML. These experiments will identify components of myeloproliferative signaling which are abnormally active in MF and sAML, and may represent targets for improved therapeutic intervention.
