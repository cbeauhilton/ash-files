    "abstract_text": "Antithrombotic therapy by thrombomodulin-dependent activation of endogenous protein C might be safer than currently used therapies, since endogenous activated protein C (APC) is generated and probably concentrated on the endothelial surface and not in blood that escapes the blood vessels during injury. We compared the antithrombotic and antihemostatic activities of a protein C selective recombinant double mutant human thrombin (W215A/E217A; WE) that activates endogenous protein C on the endothelial surface, in vivo, with a low molecular weight heparin, enoxaparin in awake non anticoagulated baboons. Thrombosis was initiated by interposing a two part device consisting of a 2cm, 4mm ID, polyethylene terephthalate vascular graft (DVG) followed by a 2cm silicone tubing chamber, 9mm ID, into a chronic femoral arteriovenous shunt in baboons. Upon initiation of blood flow at 100mL/min, wall shear rate of 265sec \u22121 in the 4mm ID segment (arterial type flow) and 29sec \u22121 in the expansion chamber (venous type flow), platelet thrombus growth was monitored by gamma camera imaging of autologous 111 In-labeled platelets for 1 hour. Fibrin accumulation was quantified by homologous 125 I-labeled fibrinogen. Bleeding time and aPTT were monitored. WE was administered as a loading IV bolus (1/3 dose) 10 minutes before thrombus initiation followed by maintenance infusion (2/3 dose) for the duration of the study at 3 dose levels: 1.8 \u03bcg/kg (dose-1), 3.75 \u03bcg/kg (dose-2) and 7.5 \u03bcg/kg (dose-3). Results were compared to controls given normal saline and to 3 doses of IV enoxaparin (1/2 dose loading + 1/2 dose maintenance): 0.3 mg/kg (dose-1), 0.6 mg/kg (dose-2) and 1.2mg/kg (dose-3) (3\u20135 animals in each study group). WE inhibition of platelet deposition in the chamber was dose dependent and reduced by 57%, 76% and 95% for dose 1, 2 and 3 respectively, compared to controls (p < 0.05 each). Enoxaparin likewise reduced thrombosis in the chamber by 49%, 83% and 91% (p< 0.05 each) respectively at the 3 doses tested. Fibrin accumulation paralleled the platelet deposition data in the chamber. Thrombus growth on DVG was only reduced at dose level 3 for both WE and enoxaparin by 18% and 47%, respectively as determined by platelet deposition. Fibrin accumulation was reduced by 35% by WE and 51% for enoxaparin at dose 3 on the arterial thrombosis segment. Bleeding times did not increase significantly with any of the treatments except for dose-3 of enoxaparin which prolonged the bleeding time from 3.5\u00b11.3 minutes to 5.3 \u00b1 1.4 minutes. Prolongation of APTT was 1.14, 1.33, and 2.04 fold for WE doses 1, 2 and 3, respectively and enoxaparin prolonged the APTT by 1.25, 1.6 and 1.9 fold at dose 1, 2 and 3, respectively. We conclude that low dose WE infusion is safe and about two orders of magnitude more antithrombotic than enoxaparin infusion in the baboon model of thrombosis."
