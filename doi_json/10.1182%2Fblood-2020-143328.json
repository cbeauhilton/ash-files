    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) is a disease of a neoplastic nature characterized by proliferation in lymphoid tissues, classified as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of B lymphocytes (NHBL). The nomenclature derives from the specific pathophysiology of this disease, that proliferates in the marginal area of the mantle of the germinal center of the lymph nodes. Objective: Carry out a detailed assessment of the immunophenotypic profile using the flow cytometry (CF) technique in 26 patients, NHBL to confirm mantle lymphoma. Materials and Methods: Biological samples from 26 patients, these being from peripheral blood (SP) or bone marrow (MO), of patients with suspected MCL were marked with monoclonal antibodies conjugated to fluorochromes and subsequently analyzed by FC. Results: all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of LCM were positive for pan-B antigens CD19, CD20 (strong) and CD22 (strong), CD19+/CD5+ and ciclin-D1 in 100% of cases. In addition to these, CD23, CD56, CD38, CD79b, Ki-67, Bcl-2, FMC-7 and HLA-Dr also obtained positive staining, as well as the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) in all cases, and isotypes of immunoglobulins, IgD, IgG and IgM in most cases, with a predominance of the heavy chain of the lambda light chain in 79% of cases. Antigens related to T lymphocytes such as CD1a, CD2, CD3, CD7, TCR alpha/beta, TCR gamma/delta, CD4 and CD8, as well as antigens related to NK cells (CD16-56) and lymphoid progenitor cells (CD10 and Terminal- deoxynucleotidyl-transferase) were negative, as were CD200, antigens related to hairy cell leukemia (CD103, CD11c and CD123) and multiple myeloma (CD138). Discussion: According to the expression of the antigens, the antibodies were positive for: Cyclin D, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD38, Ki-67, Bcl-2, FMC-7 and CD79b, which are relevant to the diagnosis of this disease. Conclusion: Flow cytometry immunophenotyping is the technique currently used to confirm the diagnosis of neoplasms, such as LCM, which, due to its specific phenotype, helps in the correct selection of treatment.
