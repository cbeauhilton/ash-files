    "abstract_text": "Introduction Long-term treatment with LMWH is the recommended standard for patients with cancer-associated VTE [1, 2]. Data on the long-term prescription of LMWH and treatment follow-up in clinical practice, and particularly the patient\u2019s view on the treatment, are scarce. The main objective of TROPIQUE was to document the prescription and use of LMWH in these patients. A sub-study aimed to assess patients\u2019 perception of long-term anticoagulant treatment with LMWH based on the validated Perception AntiCoagulant Treatment Questionnaire (PACT-Q) [2]. Methods Adult cancer patients with recent symptomatic VTE from the TROPIQUE study were asked to fill-in a PACT-Q at inclusion and at 6 months or study end. PACT-Q1 administered at study start included \u201cTreatment Expectations\u201d (7 items) measured by separate scores expressed on a 5-point Likert scale. PACT-Q2 performed at 6 months or at the end of the study included \u201cConvenience\u201d and \u201cAnticoagulant Treatment Satisfaction\u201d (13 and 7 items, respectively) measured by global scores on a 0-to-100 scale. Results A total of 409 patients (49.9% female), aged 65\u00b112.1 years, were consecutively included from November 2012 to August 2013. Most of cancers were solid tumors; 81% of patients received chemotherapy and 60.9% of cancers were metastatic. Mean treatment duration was 5.28 \u00b1 2.07 months and 98.0% of patients were treated for 3 months or more. PACT-Q1 and PACT-Q2 were collected on a voluntarily basis from 269 (67.8%) and 139 (34.0%) patients, respectively. At study start patients\u2019 treatment expectations were high, particularly regarding the confidence in the treatment to prevent blood clots (mean 3.94 \u00b1 0.75), the expectations of symptom relief (mean 3.98 \u00b1 1.04) and the importance of ease of use (mean 4.22 \u00b1 0.9) while 54.3% of patients had low or no expectations of treatment-related side effects (bruise, bleeding) (mean 2.45\u00b11.1). The treatment was considered convenient (global score 79.7 \u00b1 17.1), with the majority of patients reporting small or no difficulties with taking the treatment (subcutaneous injections) and with regards to impact on daily life. The impact of treatment-related side effects on activities was reported as low. A proportion of 69.1% of patients were overall satisfied or very satisfied with their anticoagulant treatment whereas the experience with treatment-related side effects was worse or much worse than expected for only 12.9% of patients. The \u201cAnticoagulant Treatment Satisfaction\u201d global score was 62.9 \u00b1 16.7. Abstract 4272.

These results suggest that cancer patient\u2019s capability to accept long-term injectable anticoagulant treatment is probably underestimated. These encouraging observations of patient perception of the anticoagulant therapy are essential in view of improving health professional\u2019s adherence to established treatment recommendations on cancer-associated VTE [3]. 1- Farge D, J Thromb Haemost. 2013 Jan;11(1):56-70. 2- Prins MH, Health Qual Life Outcomes, 2009. 7: p. 9. 3- Debourdeau P, Support Care Cancer. 2008 Dec;16(12):1333-41 Disclosures Farge: Pfizer: Research Funding; LEO Pharma: Research Funding.
