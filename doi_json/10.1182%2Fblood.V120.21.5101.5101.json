    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5101 Introduction: Enteropathy associated T-cell Lymphoma(EATL) is a distinctive clinicopathological entity but knowledge about potential prognostic factors in this disease is very limited. Aim: Clinicopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of single center EATL cohort focusing especially on stromal components, activation molecules and potential loss of TCR receptors. Methods: Detailed clinical analysis of a cohort of 21 patients from the southern-west Germany was performed. Additionally broad panel of immunohistochemical staining including MUM1IRF4, Blimp-1, FoxP3, TCR \u03b3, TCR\u03b2, CD11c was done. Univariate statistical analysis of survival was performed. Results: The study group comprised of 12 males and 9 females, aged 37\u201386, with the median survival time of 5 months after the initial diagnosis. Following clinical factors turned out to be connected with longer overall survival (OS): age \u2264 60years (p=0, 007), Ann Arbor Stadium I+II (p =0, 048), good general condition (p = 0, 0068), IPI 1\u20133 (p=0, 004), usage of anthracycline in the chemotherapy regimen (p=0, 0504). Longer event free survival(EFS) was connected with good general condition (p=0, 023) usage of anthracycline (p=0, 047). There was 17 Type I cases (81%) and 4 Type II (19%). EATL type, histological variants of neoplastic cells, perivascular and angiocentric growth pattern as well as tissue eosinophilia did not influence survival. There was a strikingly strong infiltration of the neoplastic infiltrate by CD11c+ dendritic cells in 9/21 cases, but it was prognostically irrelevant. MUM1/IRF4 expression was observed in 8/19(42, 1%), Blimp-1 in 5/14 (35, 7%) and FoxP3 in 7/20 (35%), but only FoxP3 positivity was connected with longer EFS. There was a trend toward worse OS (p=0, 18) and EFS (p=0, 12) in Blimp-1 positive cases. Expression of TCR\u03b2 was observed in 4/21(19%), of TCR\u03b3 in 3/21(14, 3%) while the majority of cases (14/21), showed loss of expression of both proteins. There was a trend toward longer OS (p=0, 19) and EFS (p=0, 16) in TCR \u03b2+ than in TCR\u03b3+ and TCR \u03b3-\u03b2- cases. TCR\u03b2 expression was statistically significant more frequent in patients that achieved complete remission (3/7) than in group that did not achieve CR (1/14, p=0, 049). Conclusions: In EATL several clinical factors can provide relevant prognostic information. Immunohistochemical expression of FoxP3, Blimp-1 and TCR\u03b2 seems also to be prognostically usefull. TCR\u03b2 is the only marker that can predict response to the chemotherapy in this very aggressive neoplasm. Disclosures: Finke: Fresenius Biotech GmbH: Honoraria, Research Funding."
