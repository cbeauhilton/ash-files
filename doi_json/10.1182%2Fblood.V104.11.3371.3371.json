    "abstract_text": "Activating mutations of FLT3 are frequent in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Two distinct types of FLT3 mutations are most common: Internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain-coding sequence in approximately 30% of patients with AML and point mutations within the second tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) in about 7% of AML patients. Patients carrying the FLT3 ITD mutation seem to have a significantly worse prognosis, whereas the impact of TKD mutations on clinical outcome has not yet been determined. Recently, point mutations within the activation loop of FLT3 were also found in a significant percentage of infant and childhood acute lymhoblastic leukemia (ALL). Previous studies demonstrate that mice receiving transplants of bone marrow retrovirally infected with FLT3 ITD develop a myeloproliferative disease. The effect of FLT3 TKD mutations in vivo has not yet been investigated. To examine the transforming properties of FLT3 TKD mutants in primary hematopoietic cells, we used a bone marrow transplant model (BMT). Therefore we transduced bone marrow with retrovirus expressing either FLT3 D835Y or FLT3 I836M+R and transplanted it to lethally irradiated syngeneic recipient mice. As control we also transplanted mice with FLT3 WT and ITD infected bone marrow, respectively. We found that mice transplanted with FLT3 ITD developed a myeloproliferative disorder in mice, as previously described. In contrast, mice transplanted with FLT3 TKD mutants developed a lymphoid disease with distinct hematologic manifestation. Most recipients of FLT3 TKD transduced bone marrow developed T lymphoma syndrome, characterized by massive enlargement of thymus and lymph nodes. Some mice developed a B lymphoid leukemia with splenomegaly and enlarged lymph nodes. Interestingly, the disease latency of 53 to 183 days (median 102 days) of FLT3 TKD mutants contrasted with FLT3 ITD mice, which succumbed myeloproliferative disease within 53 to 70 days (median 58 days). The lymphoid manifestation and longer latency of FLT3 TKD in a murine BMT model together with the absent influence of FLT3 TKD mutations on clinical outcome of AML patients suggest differences in cell signaling between FLT3 TKD mutants and FLT3 ITD. The TKD mutants seem to require lymphoid cell context for full malignant transformation, whereas FLT3 ITDs transform myeloid cells.",
