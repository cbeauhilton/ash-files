    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5190 Limited data is available concerning feasibility and efficacy of high dose therapy (HDT) supported by autologous PBSCT in elderly patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In young patients with poor prognostic features intensification supported by PBSCT as a part of first-line treatment suggests survival benefit. It is not clear if the same strategy is applicable to the older patients. The Institute Paoli-Calmettes database was reviewed for all DLBCL patients who received BEAM followed by PBSCT in patients >=60 years old between January 1998 and January 2010 (13 years). All patients were HIV-negative and received BEAM intensification as a part of front-line treatment. All of them were in a complete response after CHOP or R-CHOP induction prior to autograft. Thirty six auto-transplanted patients were identified (median age 63 y, range 60\u201368). This cohort was compared with closely matched group of 43 patients of same age range, who received first-line CHOP or R-CHOP regimen without intensification in the same 13-year interval. Only patients in a complete response after first line were included. As frontline autoPBSCT was performed in high-risk patients, the group without HDT was naturally privileged in the terms of Ann-Arbor stage and aaIPI index. There was significant difference in the localised vs disseminated disease (stage I-II: 53,4% in no-HDT vs 14% in HDT group, p=0,00025) and aaIPI (0-1: 72% in no-HDT vs 28% in HDT, p=0,000086) between the two groups. Factors evaluated included treatment-related mortality (TRM), overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). There were no transplant-related deaths in the HDT group. The estimated 5-year OS was 81,3% (95% CI 62,5-91,9 %) and 10-year OS was 65% (95%CI 34,2-86,9%) for HDT group compared to 91,5% (95% CI 77,5-97,1%) and 58,4% (95% CI 20\u201388,8%) in the no-HDT group (p=NS). There were 8 events (6 relapses and 2 secondary malignancy deaths) in the HDT group and 11 events (9 relapses and 2 secondary malignancy deaths) in no-HDT (5-year EFS 77,6% (95% CI 60,3-88,8%) vs 78,3% (95%CI 62,3-88,8%), p=NS)). We conclude that front-line autologous PBSCT with BEAM conditioning can be safely performed in patients aged 60 years or above with DLBCL after CHOP of R-CHOP induction. There was no difference in OS and EFS between cohorts with and without intensification even if the auto-transplantation procedure was reserved for the high risk patients only. The first-line HDT with autologous PBSCT in older patients with high-risk IPI score might improve survival in this group and produce results similar to those in the low-risk group.
