    "abstract_text": "Clozapine is a highly efficacious drug for the treatment of schizophrenia, but its use is limited, in part due to the side effect of agranulocytosis. In order to reduce the incidence of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA), patients are required to submit to a blood monitoring program. There is evidence that there is a genetic component to CIA, with previously published associations in a number of genes, including HLA-DQB1 ( Dettling et. al., Arch Gen Psychiatry  2001 : 59 , 93 \u201394 ) and HLA-C ( Dettling et. al., Pharmacogenetics  2001 : 11 , 135 \u2013141 ). If a genetic test for CIA were developed, it is possible that clozapine could become a safer drug and more patients could benefit from its use. As a first step in developing such a test, we have conducted a case-control study to discover genetic markers associated with CIA. Cases were patients with an ANC5000 and ANC<1500 at least one year. For each case, we attempted to enroll 2 age-, gender- and ethnicity-matched controls. We were successful in collecting blood, medical histories and informed consent from 33 CIA cases and 54 controls. Near complete matching was achieved between the cases and controls and ethnicity was balanced by self report and by genomic control. The table below provides clinical and demographic information about the patients. Characteristics of the Discovery  . . Cases n=33 . Controls n=54 .

Single nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertion/deletions were scored and a haplotype analysis conducted, comparing the frequency of haplotypes in cases to those in controls using logistic regression with covariates of age, gender and race. Permutation tests were done within each gene and a genetic marker was considered significant with an adjusted p value<0.05. Using these criterian, we have discovered associations between genetic markers in 5 different genes and CIA. Each of the genetic markers is a haplotype with at least 3 polymorphisms. Two of the genes, HLA-C and HLA-DQB1 have been previously reported to be associated with CIA. A combination of genetic markers from 2 genes has 80% sensitivity and specificity for CIA in this discovery population. These findings are sufficient to continue development for a diagnostic test, which will include attempting to replicate the findings in an independently collected cohort. These findings may be applicable to agranulocytosis induced by other drugs.",
