    "abstract_text": "CML blast crisis is characterized by the continued presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, which expresses the P210 BCR-ABL fusion protein, and the acquisition of additional molecular and chromosomal alterations. Evolution from CML chronic phase to blast crisis is associated with loss of heterozygosity at chromosome region 1p36, which contains the putative tumor suppressor RIZ1. We found that RIZ1 expression decreases during progression from CML chronic phase to myeloid blast crisis and that forced RIZ1 expression in CML blast crisis (CML-BC) cell lines decreases proliferation, increases apoptosis, and enhances differentiation. Furthermore, we found that RIZ1 represses IGF-1 autocrine production and blocks the activation of the IGF-1 receptor, AKT, and ERK signaling pathways in CML-BC cell lines thereby implicating RIZ1 control of the IGF-1 pathway in the regulation of these phenotypes. As BCR-ABL induces a growth factor independent phenotype due to the activation of autocrine growth factor production, we analyzed IGF-1 expression in CML-BC cell lines following exposure to imatinib. We found that imatinib treatment reduced IGF-1 mRNA and extracellular IGF-1 suggesting that RIZ1 may suppress blast crisis by counteracting the ability of BCR-ABL activate RIZ1 regulated genes. We characterized the signaling pathways used by BCR-ABL to activate IGF-1 expression and found that the HCK inhibitor PP2 and STAT5b shRNA reduced IGF-1 expression whereas the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 increased IGF-1 expression. These results suggest that BCR-ABL activates HCK, which in turn activates STAT5b and induces IGF-1 expression. To confirm the importance of BCR-ABL induced IGF-1 signaling to CML-BC cell line viability, proliferation and apoptosis, we characterized these cellular phenotypes in the presence of IGF-1 receptor blocking antibody and the IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1024. Blockage of autocrine IGF-1 signaling in CML-BC cell lines using an anti-IGF-1 receptor blocking antibody reduced cell viability and decreased proliferation. AG1024 treatment of CML-BC cell lines decreased proliferation and induced apoptosis. Together these results demonstrate that RIZ1 counteracts the ability of BCR-ABL to induce IGF-1 signaling in CML-BC cell lines, which influences cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Our findings highlight RIZ-1 and IGF-1 signaling pathways as potential therapeutic targets for treating CML blast crisis.",
