    "abstract_text": "Anti-Lepore hemoglobins are rare \u03b2\u03b4 fusion variants that arise from nonhomologous crossover during meiosis, resulting in a \u03b4-\u03b2\u03b4-\u03b2 configuration in the \u03b2 globin cluster on the short arm of chromosome 11. No such variant has previously been reported in Chinese. We studied 2 unrelated Chinese families with anti-Lepore due to a novel \u03b2\u03b4 fusion. A moderate increase of Hb A 2 to between 16.8 and 19.2% of total Hb was seen in 4 clinically and hematologically normal carriers, while in 1 patient with concurrent \u03b2 thalassemia allele and mild thalassemia intermedia phenotype, the Hb A 2 was markedly raised to 42.2%. Potential \u03b2\u03b4 fusion gene was amplified using PCR with primer 5\u2032 to \u03b2 globin gene Cap site and 3\u2032 to \u03b4 globin gene poly A region in these 5 subjects. Direct sequencing of the PCR products revealed a crossover between the \u03b2 and \u03b4 globin gene within a 54 bp region spanning the junction of CAP and exon 1 in all 5 subjects. Active transcription of this novel \u03b2\u03b4 fusion gene was studied in 2 subjects (1 normal carrier and the patient with thalassemia intermedia). Using primer pair 5\u2032 to \u03b2 globin gene Cap site and at the 3\u2032 end of \u03b4 globin gene exon 3, a 655 bp PCR product was obtained from cDNA in both subjects. Direct sequencing confirmed the presence of a \u03b2\u03b4 fusion mRNA. The predicted protein product of this fusion gene was identical to \u03b4 globin, since only the 5\u2032 untranslated region was \u03b2 specific. Determination of \u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA ratios by quantitative real-time PCR was performed in 2 normal carriers (ratio 3.28 and 3.95) and the patient with thalassemia intermedia (ratio 25.59). These were compared with ratios \u00b1 standard deviation from 20 normal controls (1.92\u00b10.55), 5 unrelated patients with \u03b2 thalassaemia minor (17.23\u00b15.38) and 3 unrelated patients with \u03b2 thalassemia major (139.21\u00b139.50). Mild down-regulation of the \u03b2 gene in cis due to this interposed \u03b2\u03b4 fusion gene was demonstrated. Although heterozygotes of this novel anti-Lepore Hb had normal red cell indices and were clinically silent, compound heterozygotes with \u03b2 0 mutation in trans produced a mild thalassemia intermedia phenotype with a markedly raised Hb A 2 level that might mimic clinically mild Hb E-\u03b2 + thalassemia. Awareness of this new anti-Lepore Hb will help to resolve diagnostic problems in regions with significant prevalence of globin disorders.",
