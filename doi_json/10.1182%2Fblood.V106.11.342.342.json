    "abstract_text": "Engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) by antigen/major histocompatibility complex initiates a signaling cascade involving activation and recruitment of multiple key intracellular proteins, including the zeta-chain-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70). ZAP-70-deficient mice show thymocyte developmental arrest and mutations of ZAP-70 are associated with severe combined immunodeficiency in humans. However, regulation of these early biochemical processes is not completely understood. RhoH, first identified as a hypermutable gene in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas, belongs to the family of Rho guanosine triphosphatases (Rho GTPases), which are recognized as critical mediators of signaling pathways regulating cell growth, differentiation and function (Gu et al., Science 302: 445-9). The expression of RhoH is restricted to hematopoietic cells, and using in vitro protein-binding and immunoprecipitation assays, we found that RhoH interacts with ZAP-70 in the TCR complex. Therefore, to understand the role of this highly expressed protein in T cell development and function, we have generated RhoH-deficient mice using homologous recombination. RhoH-/- mice are viable and normal in body size. However, the thymuses of 4\u20136 week-old RhoH-/- mice are significantly smaller and show a 3-fold decrease in cellularity compared with those from WT littermates. RhoH-/- thymocyte development is severely blocked at the CD4 + CD8 + double positive (DP) stage, resulting in markedly fewer CD4 or CD8 single positive (SP) T cells in RhoH-/- thymus (CD4 SP: 10.5+/\u2212 1.6 vs. 1.1+/\u22120.2; CD8 SP: 6.8+/\u22120.7 vs. 0.8+/\u22120.1, cell number x10 6 , WT vs. RhoH\u2212/\u2212, n\u226515 mice, p<0.001). Numbers of peripheral T cells are also significantly reduced in RhoH\u2212/\u2212 mice. RhoH DP thymocytes exhibit reduced surface expression of TCRb, but normal levels of TCRb mRNA. Further, the few circulating T cells in RhoH\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit normal expression of TCRb. These data suggest that reduced TCRb surface expression is a result, rather than a cause of the developmental arrest. In addition, expression of the activation marker, CD5, is severely reduced on RhoH\u2212/\u2212 DP thymocytes (mean fluorescence intensity: 65.3+/\u22124.7 vs. 7.2+/\u22120.9, WT vs. RhoH\u2212/\u2212, n\u22659 mice, p<0.01). These phenotypes are similar to ZAP-70-deficient mice and suggest that the thymocyte developmental arrest is due to defective TCR signaling pathway in RhoH\u2212/\u2212 mice. To determine the potential role of RhoH in TCR signaling, we studied proliferative responses to anti-CD3 antibody cross-linking of RhoH\u2212/\u2212 spleen T cells. RhoH\u2212/\u2212 cells show significantly defective proliferation ( 3 H-thymidine incorporation: 10.5+/\u22120.9 vs. 2.1+/\u22120.2, cpm x10 3 , WT vs. RhoH\u2212/\u2212, n=6, p<0.01) as well as impaired survival (% viable cells: 27+/\u22122 vs. 6+/\u22121, WT vs. RhoH\u2212/\u2212, n=3, p<0.01). Additionally, activation of Rac GTPases and p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases, known downstream effectors of the TCR-ZAP70 complex, is significantly reduced in response to TCR stimulation in RhoH\u2212/\u2212 T cells as compared with WT cells. Finally, we show that retrovirus-mediated re-expression of RhoH into RhoH\u2212/\u2212 bone marrow is sufficient to restore normal thymic development in Rag2\u2212/\u2212 recipient mice, demonstrating the specific role of RhoH in thymic development. Together, our studies demonstrate that RhoH is essential for proper thymocyte development and function, and also implicate RhoH as a novel, critical regulator of T cell signaling possibly through its interaction with ZAP-70 in the TCR complex.",
