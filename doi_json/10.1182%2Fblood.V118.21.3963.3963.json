    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3963 Background: Pomalidomide at doses of 2 or 4 mg/d has demonstrated excellent activity in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM). Between November 2007 and November 2010, we opened 5 sequential phase 2 trials using the pomalidomide at differing doses with weekly dexamethasone (Pom/dex) regimen to study the efficacy of this regimen. Methods: The five cohorts consisted of: Cohort 1 (N=60): relapsed MM with 1\u20133 prior regimens, 2 mg dose; Cohort 2 (N=34): lenalidomide refractory, 2 mg dose; Cohort 3 (N=35): bortezomib/lenalidomide refractory, 2 mg dose; Cohort 4 (N=35): bortezomib/lenalidomide refractory, 4 mg dose; and Cohort 5 (N=60) lenalidomide refractory, 1\u20133 prior regimens, 4 mg dose. Pomalidomide was given orally 2 mg daily or 4mg daily on days 1\u201328 of a 28-day cycle with oral dexamethasone given 40 mg daily on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Response was assessed by the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response criteria. All patients received aspirin 325 mg daily for DVT prophylaxis or full dose anticoagulation. Results: A total of 225 patients were enrolled across all 5 cohorts. One patient was ineligible and excluded from analysis. The median age was 63 years (32.0\u201388.0). The median time since diagnosis was 53 months. Forty percent had high-risk molecular markers. Eighty-nine percent had received previous IMIDs including thalidomide (53%) and lenalidomide (81%). Sixty-two percent had previous bortezomib and 73% had prior transplant. The median follow-up is 12.6 months, but varies from 9.4 months for the most recent cohort to 30 months for the first cohort. Sixty-nine percent are alive and 30% remain progression free. Toxicities \u2265 grade 3 are shown in table 1 and patient outcomes are shown in Table 2 . Table 1.

Responses are durable. Response rates and toxicity are similar between the 2 mg and 4 mg doses. Disclosures: Lacy: Celgene: Research Funding.
