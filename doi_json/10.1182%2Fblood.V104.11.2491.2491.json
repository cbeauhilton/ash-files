    "abstract_text": "The profound suppression of T-cell immunity seen in patients with an inherited PNP deficiency supports the potential application of inhibitors of this purine salvage enzyme in the therapy of T-cell malignancies. Forodesine is an especially promising candidate for such a use since it is a potent and selective transition-state analog inhibitor of human PNP that has demonstrated clinical activity and a good safety profile in patients with advanced T-cell malignancies. A multi-center phase I/II dose-escalation study was conducted in which 9 doses of forodesine were administered to patients with refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) via a 30-minute intravenous infusion (day 1) followed 24 hours later by doses every 12 hours (days 2\u20135); three courses were given at 16-day intervals. To-date 13 patients with CTCL or Sezary syndrome, a prototype of CTCL, have been enrolled and treated with at least one course of forodesine. 9/13 patients had an improvement in skin and/or a pharmacodynamic response as measured by a decrease in the absolute Sezary cell numbers and/or the CD4/CD8 ratio (Table 1), although the percentage of Sezary cells did not change except for patient 03 (eg, 63.4% pre-course 3 diminished to 17.6% post-course 3). There was one complete response and two partial responses. The plasma 2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (dGuo) concentration was elevated in all 13 patients (range: 1.7 \u2013 12.8 \u03bcM) (Table 1). Forodesine was generally safe and well tolerated in this population; hyperuricemia was considered dose-limiting in only one patient. Table 1.

Additional clinical and pharmacodynamic data will be presented. These encouraging findings have led to the initiation of a phase I/II study of an oral formulation of forodesine in CTCL/Sezary patients.",
