    "abstract_text": "Expression of a constitutively active mutant of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with poor survival. Most mutations occur in the activation loop, at Asp 816 or Asn 822, resulting in ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation and resistance to many of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors currently in use. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) also is upregulated and/or constitutively activated in many malignancies, including AML. Stat3 is activated by both wild-type c-Kit, which is expressed on most AML blasts, and by mutant c-Kit. Like mutant c-Kit, increased Stat3 activity has been associated with poor outcome in patients with AML. Stat3 exists in two isoforms \u2013 full length Stat3\u03b1 (p92) and C-terminally truncated Stat3\u03b2 (p83) \u2013 and the contribution of each isoform to c-Kitmediated leukemogenesis is not known. To begin to address this issue, we generated IL-3-dependent 32D murine myeloid cells that inducibly overexpress Stat3\u03b1 when treated with dexamethasone and doxycycline (induced: Stat3\u03b1 HI ; uninduced: Stat3\u03b1 LO ). We further transfected these cells with wild-type c-Kit (c-Kit WT ), c-Kit D816H or c-Kit N822K . First, we established by immunoblotting that c-Kit and Stat3\u03b1 were tyrosine-phosphorylated only after stem cell factor (SCF) stimulation in cells expressing c-Kit WT , but were constitutively phosphorylated in c-Kit D816H and c-Kit N822K cells. To test the effects of increased Stat3\u03b1 on survival and proliferation, we withdrew cells from IL-3 and stimulated with SCF (100 ng/ml) for 3 days; control cells remained unstimulated. We measured the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis at day 3 by FACS using annexin V-PE labeling. In cells expressing c-Kit WT , apoptosis was significantly reduced in SCF-stimulated Stat3\u03b1 HI cells compared to SCF-stimulated Stat3\u03b1 LO cells (8.4 \u00b1 5.0% v. 40.8 \u00b1 19.9%; p <0.05). In cells expressing c-Kit D816H or c-Kit N822K , apoptosis was significantly reduced in Stat3\u03b1 HI cells compared to Stat3\u03b1 LO cells (c-Kit D816H : 30.2 \u00b1 10.2% v. 66.7 \u00b1 8.1%, p <0.05; c-Kit N822K : 25.1 \u00b1 17.4% v. 61.4 \u00b1 19.8%, p <0.05). SCF treatment had no detectable effect on apoptosis in cells expressing mutant c-Kit. Next, we measured the rate of proliferation using the membrane tracking dye PKH26. Fluorescence histograms, with gating on live cells, were modeled using ModFit LT, and the proliferation index (PI; total number of cells/calculated number of cells in parental generation) at day 3 was calculated. Cells expressing c-Kit WT did not proliferate well in the absence of SCF-stimulation, with PIs 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 and 2.1 \u00b1 0.3 for Stat3\u03b1 LO and Stat3\u03b1 HI , respectively. The PI for SCF-stimulated Stat3\u03b1 HI cells was significantly higher than the PI for SCF-stimulated Stat3\u03b1 LO cells (5.4 \u00b1 0.7 v. 3.7 \u00b1 1.1, p <0.05). Surprisingly, cells expressing mutant c-Kit showed only low levels of proliferation, regardless of Stat3\u03b1 level or SCF stimulation. The PI was 2.0 \u00b1 0.5 in unstimulated Stat3\u03b1 HI c-Kit D816H cells and 2.4 \u00b1 0.3 in Stat3\u03b1 HI c-Kit N822K cells. Thus, both wild-type and mutant c-Kit activate Stat3\u03b1, which results in marked resistance to apoptosis. Wild-type c-Kit also activates a distinct signaling pathway that drives proliferation, and this process is augmented by Stat3\u03b1 activation. These findings suggest that the critical role for Stat3\u03b1 in myeloid leukemogenesis is apoptosis prevention and that targeting Stat3\u03b1 is likely to be an effective therapeutic approach for leukemias with wild-type or mutant c-Kit."
