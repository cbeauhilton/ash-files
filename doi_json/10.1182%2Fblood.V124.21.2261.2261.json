    "abstract_text": "Background: Body mass index (BMI: kg/m2) and change in BMI during treatment might influence treatment outcome of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, previous studies in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia reported contradictory results. Therefore, we studiedthe influence of (change in) BMI on treatment outcome in pediatric ALL patients who were treated according to a dexamethasone-based protocol (Dutch Childhood Oncology Group [DCOG] ALL-9). Patients and Methods: Data on body composition were prospectively collected from a cohort of newly diagnosed Dutch pediatric ALL patients ( N =762, age 2-17 years), treated from 1997-2004. BMI at diagnosis was expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS) and categorized into underweight (\u2264\u20131.8 SDS ), or normal weight and overweight (>\u20131.8 SDS ). BMI loss was defined after 32 weeks of treatment. Dual X-ray absorptiometry scans were performed in a nested single center cohort (n=106) to assess the contribution of %fat and lean body mass to BMI. Multivariate analyses were corrected for age at diagnosis and risk treatment grpup. Results: Multivariate analyses showed that patients with underweight (8%) had an increased risk of relapse (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.79, 95% CI: [1.04-3.10], and a similar overall survival (HR 1.10 [0.57-2.10]). BMI loss during the first 32 weeks of treatment was associated with a decreased overall survival (HR 2.10 [1.14-3.87]), and a similar risk of relapse (HR 1.27 [0.70-2.30]) compared to patients without BMI loss. Dual X-ray absorptiometry revealed that BMI loss mainly consisted of a loss of lean body mass and gain in %fat. Conclusion: Underweight at diagnosis is associated with an increased risk of relapse and a BMI loss early during treatment is associated with an increased mortality. This suggests that these patients might benefit from exercise interventions and a high-quality nutrient diet during therapy. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
