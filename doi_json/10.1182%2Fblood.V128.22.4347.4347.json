    "abstract_text": "The bone marrow and lymph node microenvironments are important in promoting cell proliferation, survival and protection from drug induced apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Chemokine networks, such as the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis, in combination with selectins, such as CD62L and integrins allow the migration of CLL cells to these protective niches. The B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling pathway is the most important pathway involved in micro-environmental crosstalk and CLL cell survival. Further, it has been shown to interact with the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling pathway. The role of the STAT3 in CLL pathogenesis is unclear; however, it is constitutively phosphorylated on serine residue 727 (serine pSTAT3) in CLL cells. Here, we investigate the role of STAT3 in CLL cell survival and migration, using pharmacological inhibition and siRNA knockdown. Phospho-tyrosine and phospho-serine STAT3 were assessed by flow cytometry and western blotting. Apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V/Propidium Iodide staining by flow cytometry. The expression of cell surface markers involved in cell adhesion and homing was determined by multicolour flow cytometry. Stimulation of the BCR using immunoglobulin F(ab\u00b4)2 fragments induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in CLL cells with unmutated immunoglobulin (IgVH) genes (n=7) but not mutated IgVH genes (n=5). This induced tyrosine phosphorylation was abrogated by pre-treatment with the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor Ruxolitinib and the BCR inhibitors Ibrutinib and Idelalisib (p<0.05, n=5). Gene expression studies using Taqman Assays showed BCR stimulation resulted in an upregulation of STAT3 regulated genes in CLL cells with unmutated IgVH genes. Interestingly, stimulation of BCR resulted in a significant increase in CD62L expression, which was inhibited by pre-treatment with Ibrutinib and Ruxolitinib (p<0.05, n=5). STAT3 inhibition was shown to have a divergent effect on CLL cell survival: In patient samples with >70% positive serine pSTAT3 cells, the STAT3 inhibitor cucurbitacin I induced apoptosis with a concurrent downregulation in serine phosphorylation (n=3); while in patient samples with <70% positive serine pSTAT3 cells, treatment with cucurbitacin I resulted in a decrease in apoptosis and a concurrent increase in serine phosphorylation (n=3). The STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 had a similar effect but the upstream JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib had no effect on serine phosphorylation and no effect on the apoptosis of CLL cells. In addition, siRNA mediated STAT3 knockdown and treatment with cucurbitacin I and S31-201, resulted in a significant decrease in CD62L positive CLL cells (p<0.0001, n=29). The role of STAT3 in CLL cell adhesion under shear flow conditions was investigated using a microfluidics system including a neMESYS Low Pressure syringe pump system and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) coated biochips. Treatment of CLL cells with cucurbitacin I resulted in a significant decrease in adhesion to endothelial cells (p<0.001, n=4). The effect of STAT3 inhibition on the chemotaxis of CLL cells was investigated using Neuroprobe 96-well ChemoTx plates. Treatment with cucurbitacin I resulted in a significant decrease in CLL cells migrated in response to the chemokine CXCL12 compared to control (p=0.0001, n=8). In addition, treatment of CLL cells with CXCL12 resulted in an increase in serine pSTAT3 that was downregulated by pretreatment with cucurbitacin I. This study has shown: 1. Activation of STAT3 by BCR stimulation occurs in poor prognostic unmutated IgVH genes 2. Serine pSTAT3 has a role in cell survival in response to STAT3 inhibition 3. A role for STAT3 in CLL cell adhesion and migration, in particular in the regulation of the expression of CD62L. In conclusion, this study shows a role for the STAT3 pathway in cell survival and CLL cell-microenvironment crosstalk, suggesting therapeutic potential by interfering with the migration and homing of CLL cells to the lymph node and bone marrow microenvironments.
