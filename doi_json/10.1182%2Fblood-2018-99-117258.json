    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most aggressive hematological malignancy that originates in the bone marrow (BM). Despite advances in the molecular characterization of AML, factors regulating its progression are still not known. Among several BM niches that support AML growth in the BM, the osteogenic niche has gained attention in recent years owing to its potential role in leukemogenesis. Genetic alterations in osteoprogenitor cells have been shown to induce myeloid leukemia in mouse models. We reported recently that AML cells induce osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the BM to facilitate faster AML engraftment in mice (Battula et al., JCI Insight, 2017). However specifics of this osteogenic niche generated by AML are not known. Here we hypothesize that AML expands osteo-progenitor rich niche in the BM, but that the mature bone is reduced. To determine the type of AML-induced osteo-lineage differentiation in the BM, we generated transgenic reporter mice by crossing Osx-CreERt2 mice with Ocn-GFP; ROSA-tdTomato mice. The resulting triple transgenic mice has the genotype of Osx-CreERt2;Ocn-GFP;ROSA-tdTomato. In these mice the tdTomato (red) positive cells represents osteo-lineage cells that originate from Osterix expressing (Osx+) cells, whereas a GFP + cell represents an osteocalcin - expressing (Ocn + ) mature osteoblast. Seven day old triple transgenic mice were injected with tamoxifen to activate Osx-CreERT2 to mark the Osx + cells with tomato reporter. To investigate the osteogenic cell type that is induced by AML cells in the bone marrow, we implanted murine AML cells with MLL-ENL fusion proteins into Osx-CreERt2;Ocn-GFP;ROSA-tdTomato mice. Three weeks after implantation of AML cells, the femurs and tibia of these mice were dissected and subjected to histological evaluation using fluorescence microscopy. In control BM without AML, the GFP + (Ocn + ) cells were found in the trabecular bone surface as well as the periosteum of the bone, whereas the tdTomato + (Osx + )cells were found in the marrow and the bone matrix; this suggests that some of the osteocytes originated from tamoxifen-induced Osx + osteoprogenitor cells. Interestigly, in mice implanted with AML cells, we found a 3-4 fold increase in Osx + cells in the marrow compared to normal BM (Fig 1A). However, the number of GFP + cells on the endosteum and trabecular bone surface was reduced, suggesting that AML cells might expand osteoprogenitor cells but not fully differentiated mature osteoblasts. Next, to investigate whether AML cells affect the mature bone, AML PDX cells developed in our laboratory were implanted into NSG mice. The PDX models usually take 12-14 weeks to achieve >90% engraftment in the peripheral blood which provides ample time to observe alterations in bone composition. At this stage, the mice were subjected to computed tomography imaging to measure bone architecture, volume (BV), mineral density (BMD) and bone volume fraction (BVF). Interestingly, we observed large bone cavities close to epiphysis and metaphysis areas in the femur and tibia of mice with AML (Fig 1B). In addtion, BMD and BVF in these mice were reduced by 20-30% compared to control mice without leukemia. To validate the bone resorption in these mice, bone histomorphometric analysis was performed on femurs and tibias from mice with and without AML. Masson-Goldner's Trichrome staining revealed a 5- to 10-fold decrease in the trabecular and cortical bone thickness in AML femurs compared to normal femurs. Moreover, measurements of osteoclast activation by tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase (TRAP) revealed positive staining for osteoclasts on the endosteal surface and massive bone resorption in AML bone compared to normal bone. Mechanistic studies showed that AML cells inhibit osteoprotegerin (OPG) ~10 fold in MSCs, a factor that inhibits the RNAK ligand which in turn activates osteoclasts that breakdown the bone. In conclusion, our data suggest that bone homeostasis is dysregulated in AML by induction of osteogenic and osteolytic activities simultaneously. AML cells induce an osteoprogenitor niche but also activate osteoclasts resulting in osteopenia/osteoporosis in mouse models. In-depth analysis of bone remodeling in AML patients could result in new insights into the pathobiology of the disease and provide therapeutic avenues for AML.
