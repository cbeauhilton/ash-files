    "abstract_text": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is effectively treated with imatinib (imatinib mesylate, IM), a small molecule inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase that is expressed in the entire hematopoietic compartment including stem cells (HSC) and progenitors. However, it is still unclear whether IM-therapy is able to eradicate BCR-ABL-positive HSC and progenitors. By transforming murine E2A-deficient pluripotent hematopoietic cells (Ikawa, et al ., Immunity 04) with p210 BCR-ABL , we determined that as few as 50 granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMP)-like cells were sufficient to induce a transplantable CML-like disease in congenic mice, and that the leukemogenic GMP displayed higher levels of \u03b2-catenin activity than either the non-transformed GMP or the transformed nonGMP (most of which were myeloid differentiated cells), both in culture and in transplanted mouse bone marrow ( Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 08, in press ). The initiation of transformation required BCR-ABL kinase activity; however, whereas transformed nonGMP were sensitive to IM-treatment, expansion and survival of the leukemogenic progenitors in ex vivo -culture or in mice were not completely inhibited by IM-treatment. The drug resistance did not correlate with higher levels of BCR-ABL, mutations at ABL-kinase domain, induction of quiescence, stromal support or drug efflux. Additionally, the differential responses between the transformed progenitors and differentiated cells to IM-treatment were not affected by the restoration of E2A-function. These results imply that leukemic progenitors possess innate resistance to IM and that eradication of these cells with other drugs is required to cure CML. We are also investigating BCR-ABL-positive residual disease in HSC and progenitors of chronic phase CML patients on IM-therapy."
