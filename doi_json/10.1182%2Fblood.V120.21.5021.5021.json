    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5021 Background: A distinguishing characteristic of myeloma plasma cells is the large quantity of paraprotein that they synthesize and secrete, rendering them especially sensitive to the effects of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Consistent with this notion, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib disrupts protein equilibrium in the ER by preventing misfolded proteins from being properly degraded. Given the clinically validated importance of targeting ER stress mediated pathways in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), we sought to identify natural products that modulate pathways known to be an effective therapeutic target for MM for potential use to inhibit progression of asymptomatic MM to symptomatic MM without the limiting side effects of current targeted therapies. Methods: Using decreased protein processing in the secretory pathway as a measurable hallmark of ER stress, our screen employed the naturally secreted Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) as a reporter that can be easily monitored through extracellular release of luciferase activity in real time. KMS11 and ARP-1 MM cells expressing Gluc were exposed to compounds in our natural products library in order to identify those which potentially induce ER stress as measured by inhibition of Gluc secretion. The growth inhibitory activity of theaflavin-3, 3'\u2013digallate (TF3) was further characterized by MTS assay. Mechanistic studies of ER stress related pathways including the unfolded protein response (UPR) and apoptotic cascades were analyzed by standard Western blotting techniques. Results: Our screen identified the black tea polyphenol TF3 as a significant inhibitor of GLUC secretion in ARP-1 and KMS-11 cells. TF3 at 0. 5 \u03bcM inhibits GLUC secretion by 73 and 68% in ARP-1 and KMS-11 cells, respectively. This inhibition observed is on par with that observed for bortezomib and tunacamycin (a well known inducer of ER stress). TF-3 effectively inhibits cellular proliferation and induces apoptosis in a panel of MM cell lines at physiologically achievable concentrations. Apoptotic induction is at least partially mediated by ER stress mediated pathways as upregulation of the protein chaperone HSP90 and phosphorylation of eIF2-a, a key mediator of the UPR pathway, occurs prior to caspase and PARP cleavage. Conclusions: Our results suggest that TF-3 inhibits protein secretion and MM cell growth through promotion of ER stress generating mechanisms. Based upon these promising results, further mechanistic evaluation and characterization of this safe, natural product as a prophylactic agent in the treatment of asymptomatic conditions like monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is warranted.
