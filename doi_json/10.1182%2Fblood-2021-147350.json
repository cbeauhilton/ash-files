    "abstract_text": "Background: Autologous T cells engineered to express a CD19 or BCMA-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) have shown high overall response rates in treatment-refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and BCMA + multiple myeloma (MM), respectively. However, most patients will eventually relapse, and thus strategies are needed to further improve the efficacy and durability of CAR-T cell products. NKTR-255 is an investigational polyethylene glycol-modified recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15) receptor agonist designed to engage the IL-15 pathway to stimulate and expand natural killer (NK) cells and promote the survival and expansion of memory CD8 + T cells. Preclinical data in B-cell lymphoma xenograft models have shown that NKTR-255 enhanced expansion, survival, and anti-tumor activity of human CD19 CAR-T cells. Furthermore, clinical studies have validated that IL-15 augments anti-tumor activity and promotes a stem-cell memory subset in tumor-specific T cells. Here we report pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis of CAR-T cells from relapsed/refractory (R/R) NHL or MM patients who had prior CAR-T therapy and were subsequently enrolled in an ongoing Phase 1 study of NKTR-255. Methods: Patients with R/R NHL or MM who progressed following prior CAR-T therapy were enrolled in a Phase 1 open-label trial evaluating safety, tolerability, and PD after treatment with NKTR-255 (NCT04136756). Patients received single-agent NKTR-255 IV administered every 3 weeks. Peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cell samples were obtained before and at intervals following NKTR-255 infusion. CAR-T cells were identified by flow cytometry (FCM) using proprietary reagents to detect the CD19-CAR and BCMA-CAR in combination with antibodies to identify CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells. PD data were analyzed for patients with measurable CAR-T cells at baseline; fold change was calculated as treatment with NKTR-255 over baseline (baseline=1). Results: Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. A total of 6 patients with prior CAR-T/CAR-NK treatment were evaluated for T/ CAR-T cell counts and Ki67 expression to assess proliferation before and after NKTR-255 administration. A total of 3 patients who received NKTR-255, at 1.5 \u00b5g/kg (n=1), 4.5 \u00b5g/kg (n=1), and 6.0 \u00b5g/kg (n=1), had detectable CAR-T cells at baseline. Following NKTR-255 administration, CD3+ CAR-T cell numbers in PB demonstrated a peak average increase of ~1.7-fold (~70% increase) compared to baseline (range 1.4 to 1.8-fold); Table 1. Three patients had low CAR-T/CAR-NK cell counts at baseline and/or post-NKTR-255 treatment. NKTR-255 treatment led to a reversal of the CD4 + :CD8 + CAR-T ratio in 1 patient, with a ~2-fold increase in CD8 + compared with CD4 + CAR-T cells. FCM in PBMC demonstrated an average of ~1.6-fold increase in total CD8 + T-cell with an average 9-fold increase in the percentage of Ki67 + CD8 + T cells in all CAR-T patients following 1 dose of NKTR-255. Among the 6 patients with prior CAR-T/CAR-NK therapy, NKTR-255 was generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation, change of dose, or death. Conclusions: Following treatment with NKTR-255, there was an increase in CAR-T-cells as well as a reversal of the CD4 + :CD8 + ratio in 1 patient. Additionally, NKTR-255 induced expansion of total CD8 + cell fraction with an increase of proliferation index of Ki67 in all reported patients, supporting its role in enhancing the expansion and proliferative ability of cytotoxic T cells. Low baseline CAR-T/CAR-NK cell counts observed in patients may be due to longer time intervals between CAR-T infusion and the first dose of NKTR-255. Although preliminary, these data provide promising evidence of CAR-T cell rescue with NKTR-255 administration and represent a potentially novel means of CAR-T augmentation through enhancement of CD8 + T-cells and supports the further evaluation of NKTR-255 and CAR-T therapy as a potential strategy to enhancing the persistence of CAR-T therapy. Additional CAR-T cell patients are being evaluated following NKTR-255 treatment. Ethics approval The study was approved by the institutional review board of each participating site.
