    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4839 Introduction. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) observed in more than 90% of patients with CML as a result of t(9;22)(q34;q11), leading to the formation of chimeric gene BCR/ABL encoding for proteins with abnormal tyrosine kinase activity. Cytogenetic variants of Ph chromosome can be identifed in 5 to 10% of CML patients, involving additional chromosomes other than 9 and 22. To explain the formation of variant translocations one-step, two-step and multi-step mechanisms have been proposed. Rarely, the variant Ph chromosome results from a BCR insertion on the ABL region and form a BCR/ABL fusion gene, generally mapping to 9q34, instead of the usual location at 22q11. In very few variant Ph cases, the insertion of the BCR/ABL product in a third chromosome was demonstrated. Case Report 28 year-old man, with bilateral central scotoma and gingivorragia. Physical examination: Grade 4 splenomegaly. Peripheral blood count showed hemoglobin concentration 11.5 g/dl, platelet count: 300.000/mm 3 , and white blood cell count 590.000/mm 3 . Blood smear: myelemia exhibiting 30% of myeloid blasts. Bone marrow biopsy: panmyelosis showing 20% of myeloid blasts. Cytogenetic analysis by G-banding performed in peripheral blood verified the following karyotype: 46, XY, t(9;22;10)(q34;q11;q24)[20] The analysis of the BCR-ABL fusion gene according to standard protocols detected the presence of the b3a2 isoform. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using dual color dual fusion probes in metaphases showed a signal pattern 1F2G1R. The fusion signal mapped to 10q24, the red signal to 9q34, and the normal green signal to chromosome 22, while a second low intensity green signal mapped to the Ph chromosome. No signal was observed in der(9). Interphase FISH analysis in nuclei (n=200) presented the same signal pattern. Instead of using whole chromosome probes for 9 and 22, we hybridised probes used to detect DiGiorge syndrome. These probes detect gene control ARSA (spectrum green) localized at 22q13 and Tuple1 at 22q11 (spectrum orange). Two signals, green and orange were identified in normal chromosome 22. Ph chromosome showed the orange signal, whereas the green signal mapped to der(10). Discussion. The localization of the hybrid BCR/ABL gene on chromosomes other than 22q is a rare event wich can only be detected by FISH techniques. When these unusual translocation occurs, the hypothesis most often put forward is that several consecutive chromosome rearrangements have taken place. In the present case the interpretation of karyotypes, FISH data and molecular evidence lead to the following hypothesis: Insertion of the BCR sequence from chromosome 22 to chromosome 9 may have ocurred, producing a BCR/ABL fusion in der(9). The Ph chromosome detected by G-banding showed a different green fluorescence intensity in the metaphase FISH signal pattern with BCR/ABL dual color dual fusion probes, as a result of an insertion on chromosome 9. This first event was followed by the translocation between the derivative 9 and chromosome 10, being the final localization of the BCR/ABL gene in 10q24. FISH analysis using a DiGeorge syndrome probe, supports the hypothesis of a multistep mechanism underlying insertion and translocations events in the present case. The relocation of BCR/ABL fusion sequence on sites other than chromosme 22q11 represent a rare type of variant Ph translocation. At least 21 cases described in the literature, showed fusion gene BCR/ABL located at 9q24. Only 12 patients with variant Ph were reported bearing BCR/ABL on a third chromosome. All of them involved a masked Ph chromosome. To our best knowledge this is the first report showing a variant Ph chromosome detected by G-banding in a CML patient due to a BCR insertion on ABL sequences and exhibiting the fusion signal in a third chromosome.
