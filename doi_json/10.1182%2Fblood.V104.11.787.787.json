    "abstract_text": "The objective of this study was to analyze molecular changes that occur at the protein level in WM and IgM-MGUS in order to identify proteins dysregulated at disease progression and design new therapies. We employed antibody protein microarrays (BD Clonetech, CA) to measure changes in the patterns of protein expression between WM, IgM-MGUS and normal lymphoplasmacytic cells as control. The antibody array is a novel technique that assays protein differences directly by hybridizing fluorescently labeled protein mixtures from cell extracts onto a glass slide spotted with 512 different monoclonal antibodies specific for human proteins. CD 19+ and CD138+ purified lymphoplasmacytic cells were obtained from cryopreserved bone marrow samples of 5 newly diagnosed patients with WM and 5 patients with IgM-MGUS. Control plasma cells were obtained from 3 pooled CD19+ and CD138+ purified normal donor bone marrow cells. To assess differential expression, the mean of the ratios of Cy5/Cy3 for each sample were analyzed using the Clontech software to calculate an internally normalized ratio. The normalized data were analyzed by the Genespring software and changes of protein expression \u22652 fold in 60% of the samples as compared to normal control were identified in both WM and MGUS groups. There were 20 proteins upregulated in WM and 21 proteins in MGUS as compared to normal control cells These included proteins from the small GTPases such as the Ras, Rho and Ran families (Rab 4, MONA, RCC1, and CDC42GAP), Kinases/signaling proteins (ROK alpha, p62 dok, JAK, 14-3-3e), cyclin dependent kinase (CDK2), fatty acid synthase (HDAC3), NFkB pathway (IKKalpha, IKBe), and histone deacetylase. The WM and IgM MGUS differed in only 3 proteins using the 2-fold threshold. The WM samples showed overexpression of the heat shock protein Hsp90, the Ras family protein CDC25C, and the chemotaxis protein p43/EMAPII as compared to the MGUS samples. This is the first proteomic study of WM and MGUS patients. It identifies novel proteins dysregulated in WM that may serve in future clinical trials as targets for therapy such as Hsp90, NFkB, HDAC and fatty acid synthase. In addition, it identifies 3 proteins that identify disease progression from MGUS to WM, which could be useful for monitoring MGUS patients and designing targeted therapies to prevent progression to WM.",
