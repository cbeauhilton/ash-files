    "abstract_text": "Abstract 988 The treatment of patients with systemic AL amyloidosis remains challenging. Cyclical combination chemotherapy is used in majority of patients but a report that I.V. melphalan-dexamethasone may not overcome the poor prognosis for cardiac amyloidosis ( Deitrich S et al, Blood, 116, 2010 ) has fuelled the controversy about best front line treatment. We report outcomes of 428 patients treated with oral cyclophosphamide thalidomide dexamethasone (CTD), oral melphalan dexamethasone (M-dex), bortezomib dexamethasone with or without an alkylator (BD), cyclophosphamide-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (CLD) or stem cell transplant (ASCT) as first line treatment for systemic AL amyloidosis assessed at three large European amyloid centres in London (UK), Pavia (Italy) and Athens (Greece) between 2003\u20132010. Patients with a full baseline data set were included in the study. Clonal and organ responses were defined according to the international amyloidosis consensus statement ( Gertz et al 2005 ) and responses were assessed at 6 months or at the end of treatment. dFLC (difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC)) was used to assess the absolute FLC change after treatment. 204 (48%) received M-dex, 155 (36%) received CTD, 13 (3%) received ASCT, 28 (7%) received BD and 25 (6%) received CLD. The median number of cycles received was 5 for all regimens. 257 (60%) had cardiac involvement, 325 (76%) had renal and 59 (14%) had liver involvement. Cardiac involvement by regime was: BD 75%, CLD 68%, M-dex 65%, CTD 45% and ASCT 23%. 30 (7%) died within six months of diagnosis. The median number of organ involved was 2 (range 1\u20135) with ECOG performance status \u22652 in 123 (28%). 98 (23%) patients achieved a complete response (CR), 175 (41%) achieved a partial response (PR) and 125 (29%) did not respond to treatment. A haematological CR/PR was seen, respectively, in 22%/41% treated with CTD, 26%/44% with M-dex, 23%/46% with ASCT, 39%/42% with BD and 4%/44% with CLD. There was significantly greater reduction in dFLC after BD (median reduction 91% over starting value) compared to CTD (median 81%; p = 0.006), M-Dex (median 83%; p = 0.004) and CLD (median 72%; p = 0.03). There was no significant difference in the median dFLC reduction between patients treated with CTD and M-Dex. 100/325 (30%) had a renal organ response, 17/59 (29%) had a hepatic response and 24/257 (9%) had a cardiac response, and 61 (16%) had a cardiac response by NT-proBNP criteria. The organ and NT-proBNP responses respectively were highest in the cohort treated with BD (53% and 32%) followed by CTD (38% and 12%), ASCT (30%), M-dex (23% and 19%) and CLD (12% and nil). CTD achieved significantly better organ responses compared to M-dex (p=0.0024). At median follow up of 29 months, median overall survival (OS) for the whole cohort has not been reached with 2, 3 and 4 year estimated survival of 75%, 65% and 61%, respectively. When patients with cardiac involvement were considered, those achieving a CR have not reached median OS with an estimated 3 year survival of 89%, those with PR had an estimated median OS of 50 months and the non-responders had a median OS of 21 months. Detailed comparison by Mayo stage will be presented. There was no significant difference in the OS of patients treated with CTD or M-Dex (as compared directly or by centre). In summary, outcome of patients with AL amyloidosis across three major European centres appears comparable. BD treatment achieves significantly lower end of treatment dFLC values compared to CTD, M-dex, ASCT or CLD \u2013 which importantly translates into an organ response in over half of all patients receiving BD compared to a third of those treated with CTD and quarter of those with M-dex and further follow up may yet reveal survival differences. Organ responses appear significantly better with CTD compared to M-dex \u2013 possibly due to more rapid response to CTD since the end of treatment dFLC values are not significantly different - although this does not translate into a survival advantage. Depth of clonal response appears to be directly linked to improvement in survival of patients with cardiac amyloidosis (including in patients treated with CTD and M-dex) and organ response in general. This study supports the rational for doing urgent phase III studies confirming benefits of bortezomib combination chemotherapy for upfront treatment in AL amyloidosis and the benefit of rapid deep clonal responses in cardiac amyloidosis irrespective of the regimen.
