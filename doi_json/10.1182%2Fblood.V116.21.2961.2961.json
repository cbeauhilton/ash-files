    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2961 Reduced osteoblast activity contributes to the development of multiple myeloma-bone disease. Wingless-type (Wnt) signalling pathway is critical in osteoblastogenesis, and it is negatively regulated by molecules such as frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs), Dickkopf proteins (DKKs) and sclerostin. Myeloma cells are known to induce inhibition of osteoblastogenesis through Wnt antagonists such as DKK-1 and sFRP-2 and -3 whereas the role of sclerostin, an osteocyte-expressed negative regulator of bone formation, has not been yet investigated. We provide novel evidence showing sclerostin expression by myeloma cells from patients with multiple myeloma-bone disease and human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs). By means of a co-culture system of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and HMCLs, we demonstrated that sclerostin expression by myeloma cells and HMCLs is responsible for reduced expression of major osteoblastic specific proteins namely bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, collagen-type I, bone sialoprotein II and osteocalcin as well as decreased mineralized nodule formation and attenuated expression of member of the AP-1 transcription factor family ( i.e. Fra-1, Fra-2 and Jun-D). The addition of a neutralizing anti-sclerostin antibody to our co-culture system can restore the above parameters, through the intranuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in BMSCs. On the other hand, we demonstrated that sclerostin is also involved in inducing increased receptor activator of nuclear factor-k B ligand (RANKL) and decreased osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression in osteoblasts, contributing to the enhanced osteoclast activity occurring in patients with multiple myeloma-bone disease. Our data suggest that myeloma cells contribute to the suppression of bone formation through sclerostin secretion. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
