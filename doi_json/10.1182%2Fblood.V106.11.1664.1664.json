    "abstract_text": "The protein 4.1R gene is regulated by complex pre-mRNA processing events that facilitate the synthesis of protein isoforms with different structure, function, and subcellular localization in red cells and various nucleated cell types. One of these events involves the stage-specific activation of exon 16 inclusion in erythroblasts, which mechanically stabilizes the membrane skeleton by increasing the protein\u2019s affinity for spectrin and actin. Some of the splicing factor proteins and RNA regulatory elements responsible for this tissue-specific alternative splicing event have been defined. Here we focus on another RNA processing event, in the 5\u2032 end of the transcript that can affect the structure and function of the membrane binding domain of protein 4.1R. We have shown that 4.1R transcripts originating at three far upstream alternative promoters/first exons splice differentially to alternative acceptor sites in exon 2\u2032/2 in a manner that suggests strict coupling between transcription and alternative splicing events. A precisely analogous gene organization and RNA processing pattern has also been shown to occur in the paralogous 4.1B gene. Now we demonstrate that this coupling is evolutionarily conserved among several vertebrate classes from fish to mammals. The 4.1R and 4.1B genes from fish, bird, amphibian, and mammal genomes exhibit shared features including alternative first exons and differential splice acceptors in exon 2. In all cases, the 5\u2032-most exon (exon 1A) splices exclusively to a weaker internal acceptor site in exon 2, skipping a short sequence designated as exon 2\u2032 (17-33nt). Conversely, alternative first exons 1B and/or 1C always splice to the stronger first acceptor site, retaining exon 2\u2032. These correlations are independent of tissue type or species of origin. Since exon 2\u2032 contains a translation initiation site, this regulated splicing event generate protein isoforms with distinct N-termini. We propose that these 4.1 genes represent a physiologically relevant model system for mechanistic analysis of transcription-coupled alternative splicing. We have recently constructed a 9kb \u201cminigene\u201d that successfully reproduces the differential splicing patterns of exons 1A and 1B to exon 2\u2032/2 in transfected cells. This minigene will facilitate identification of the determinants that guide coupling. Current experiments are testing the importance for proper splicing of the transcriptional promoter, first exon sequences, length and sequence of the intron, and sequence of a conserved element within exon 2\u2032. Ultimately these studies should provide new insights into the mechanisms of coupling between far upstream, transcription-related processes and downstream alternative splicing."
