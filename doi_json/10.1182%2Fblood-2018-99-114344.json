    "abstract_text": "PARP-1 plays a critical role in DNA damage repair and contributes to progression of cancer. To address the role of PARP-1 in AML, we analyzed the expression of PARP-1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using RT-PCR. We found high expressers had higher levels of blast cells in bone marrow ( P =0.003) and WBC in peripheral blood ( P =0.008) and were associated with a more frequent FLT3 -ITD mutation (28.2% vs 17.3%, P = 0.031). The overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) of the high expression group were significantly shorter than those of the low expression group ( P =0.005 and P =0.004, respectively). High PARP-1 expression predicts poor survival in AML patients. Then, we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of PARP inhibitor BMN673 (Talazoparib) combined with, NL101, a novel SAHA-bendamustine hybrid in vitro and in vivo . The combination significantly enhanced apoptosis of AML cells and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest. Mechanistically, BMN673 and NL101 combinatorial treatment promoted DNA damage. In vivo , the combination effectively delayed the development of AML and prolonged survival.The synergistic effects of PARP inhibitor BMN673 in combination with SAHA-bendamustine hybrid, NL101, provide a new therapeutic strategy against AML.
