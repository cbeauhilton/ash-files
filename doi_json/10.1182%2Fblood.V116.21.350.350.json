    "abstract_text": "Abstract 350 Introduction: Leukapheresis is a widely utilized modality for collecting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). While collection of CD34+ cells with stem-cell activity is the primary goal of most mobilization and leukapheresis procedures, these cells only represent \u223c1% of most leukapheresis products. The profile of the non-CD34+ cells is likely influenced by the choice of mobilization strategy, and has the potential to profoundly impact the post-transplant immune milieu of the transplant recipient. Two of the most critical of the CD34-negative cell populations that are collected during leukapheresis include effector and regulatory T cells. Thus, in evaluating mobilization regimens, the impact on these regimens on the mobilization of each of these T cell populations into the peripheral blood should be rigorously evaluated. Methods: We used a rhesus macaque model to determine the impact that mobilization with AMD3100 (a.k.a., Plerixafor or Mozobil\u00ae)+ G-CSF (\u201cA+G\u201d) had on peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cell populations as well as on FoxP3+/CD4+ T cells. Three rhesus macaques were mobilized with 10ug/kg SQ of G-CSF for five consecutive days prior to leukapheresis. AMD3100 was administered at 1mg/kg SQ in combination with the last dose of G-CSF two hours prior to leukapheresis. Leukapheresis procedures were performed for two hours using a modified CS3000 Plus cell separator. A peripheral blood sample was taken before cytokine therapy, just prior to leukapheresis following mobilization, one hour during leukapheresis, and at the end of the procedure. These samples were analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry using a BD LSRII flow cytometer. Results: Bulk, effector, and regulatory T cell subpopulations were analyzed flow cytometrically. The proportion of total CD3+ T cells remained stable during mobilization and apheresis: Thus, CD3+ T cells represented 77% of peripheral blood lymphocytes prior to mobilization, and 69% post-apheresis). The balance of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells was also relatively stable. Thus, for one of the three animals tested, the CD4+ and CD8+ proportions remained unchanged after apheresis. For two animals, the average CD4+ % decreased from 67% prior to mobilization to 52% post-apheresis. In these two animals, there was a reciprocal increase in the % of CD3+ T cells that were CD8+ (28% pre-G+A to 40% post-apheresis). The CD28+/CD95- nai\u0308ve (Tn), CD28+/CD95+ central memory (Tcm) and CD28-/CD95+ effector memory (Tem) subpopulation balance of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was also determined, by comparing the relative percentages of each subpopulation post-apheresis with their relative percentages prior to mobilization. Compared to their pre-G+A percentages, the post-apheresis CD4+ percentages of Tn, Tcm and Tem were 92%, 93% and 160%, respectively. Thus, the relative proportions of Tn and Tcm CD4+ cells decreased post-apheresis, while the relative proportion of CD4+ Tem increased compared to cytokine administration. For CD8+ T cell subpopulations, the post-apheresis proportions of Tn, Tcm, and Tem compared to their pre-G-CSF proportions were 99%, 70% and 130%, respectively\u2013thus demonstrating the same direction of change as observed for CD4+ T cells. The most striking change in T cell subpopulations occurred in the CD4+/FoxP3+ compartment. The proportion of CD4+ T cells expressing FoxP3 increased by an average of 600% when post-apheresis samples were compared to pre-mobilization samples (FoxP3+ cells were 9.6% of CD4+ T cells post-apheresis versus 1.5% pre-GCSF). An average of 32% of these FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells expressed high levels of CXCR4. CXCR4 expression has been previously documented on human FoxP3+ T cells (Zou et al., Cancer Res, 2004), but this is the first observation of high level expression of CXCR4 on macaque FoxP3+ CD4 T cells, or of their ability to be efficiently mobilized with AMD3100. Discussion: These results suggest that treatment with AMD3100 and G-CSF may mobilize T cell subsets into the peripheral blood that could have beneficial effects during allo-transplantation. The combination of an increase in Tem cells, which have been observed to have decreased ability to cause GvHD (Zheng et al., Blood 2008), along with FoxP3+/CD4+ T cells, which may have regulatory functions, suggests that A+G mobilization could produce an apheresis product with a beneficial CD34-negative cell profile for allogeneic transplantation.
