    "abstract_text": "Different from acute myeloblastic leukemia, the prognostic significance of complex karyotype (CK) is not well known in adults with ALL. A recent study showed that CK (\u22655 chromosomal abnormalities) confer an increased risk of treatment failure and poor survival (Moorman, 2007). The aim of study was to analyze the possible prognostic influence of CK in Ph- adult (\u226515yr) ALL patients treated with risk-adapted protocols from the Spanish PETHEMA Group. The cytogenetic studies were reviewed following the ISCN criteria (2005). CK was defined as the finding of 3 or more structural chromosomal abnormalities. Patients were included in three different trials: ALL-96 for standard-risk (SR) ALL, and ALL-93 or ALL-AR03 for high-risk (HR) ALL. Patients with Burkitt\u2019s ALL were not included in these trials. Patients included: 237. SR: n=44, 25 males, WBC count 12x10 9 /L (SD: 14), 5 patients with CK (11.4%), 39 non-complex karyotype and normal karyotype (non- CK) (88.6%). HR: n= 193, 107 males, WBC count 58x10 9 /L (SD: 77), 25 patients with CK (13%), 168 non- CK (87%). Complete remision (CR), disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) according to karyotype group and trial are showed in Table: When CK was defined as the finding of \u2265 5 structural chromosomal abnormalities (n=11, SR=3, HR=8), DFS and OS were also significantly shortened in patients with SR ALL and CK (p=0.007 and p=0.001, respectively), but not in patients with HR ALL. Complex karyotype (defined as \u2265 3 or \u22655 structural chromosomal abnormalities) did not have any prognostic relevance in adults with high-risk Ph- ALL, whereas a significant short survival observed in standard-risk patients with complex karyotype.
