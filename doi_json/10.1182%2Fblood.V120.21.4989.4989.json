    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4989 Background: The proto-oncogene c-MYC encodes a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, growth, and apoptosis. c-MYC is mapped to the 8q24. 1 on the long arm of chromosome 8 and its rearrangement has been reported in 15% of myeloma patients independent of the disease stage (Avet-Loiseau et al. Blood 2001). However, the clinical significance of c-MYC rearrangement is not well described. Here we report the characteristics and outcome of myeloma patients with c-MYC rearrangements that were treated at our institution. Methods: We identified 18 patients (11 males, 7 females) with c-MYC rearrangements either on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses or conventional cytogenetics, who were treated at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The primary objective was to describe the patient characteristics, response to therapy, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). Results: Median age at diagnosis was 56. 5 years (21\u201372). Overall, 8 patients (44%) presented with or progressed to either plasma cell leukemia (PCL: 6) or plasmablastic myeloma (PBM: 2). Abnormalities involving chromosome 8q24. 1, the c-MYC locus, were detected on conventional cytogenetics in all 18 patients, including t(8;14)(q24. 1;q32) in 6 cases, t(2;8)(p12;q24. 1) in 3 cases, t(8;22) (q24. 1;q11. 2) in 4 cases, t(8;20)(q24. 1;q13. 3) in one case, and an abnormal chromosome 8 with unknown material attached to the 8q24. 1 region in 4 cases. Five patients (27%) had a del(13)(q14. 1)/ RB1 , one of whom had a del(17)(p13)/ TP53 , while 3 other patients had t(11;14)(q13;q32) involving CCND1-XT/IGH rearrangements. Twelve patents (66%) received induction with a novel agent: bortezomib-based = 8 (44%) and thalidomide- based = 4 (22%). Six patients (33%) received induction with conventional chemotherapy regimens: CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone) = 2, pulsed steroids only = 2, EPOCH (Etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide) = 1 and melphalan + prednisone =1. Nine patients achieved a partial response (PR, 50%) and 4 patients achieved a very good partial remission (VGPR, 22%), with an overall response rate of 72% to induction. Thirteen patients (72%) went on to receive high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HCT). Four patients died of disease progression before auto-HCT while one patient opted for stem cell harvest and cryopreservation only. Median time to auto-HCT was 7. 1 months (3. 6\u201312. 7). Median follow up in all patients was 13 months (range 3. 4\u2013105). Fifteen patients had progressed, with a median TTP of 7. 1 months and a median OS of 20. 2 months. Patients with PCL or PBM had significantly shorter OS (p=0. 04). Conclusion: This is the first report describing clinical characteristics of myeloma patients with c-MYC rearrangements. c-MYC rearrangement is associated with a higher incidence of plasma cell leukemia or plasmablastic myeloma, short TTP and OS.
