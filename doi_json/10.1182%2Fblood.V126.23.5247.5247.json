    "abstract_text": "Objective: To analyse systematically the clinical and biological characteristics of 2080 myelodysplastic syndrome patients in our laboratory from 1984 to 2013 and to reveal the unique features of MDS patient in our area. Methods: 1. Conventional cytogenetics were performed to investigated the cytogenetics changes in 2080 MDS patients. All patients were classified according to the FAB criterion, in which, 1493 cases were reclassified according to the WHO (2008) criterion; and 550 patients' outcomes were evaluated according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, WHO classification-based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) and the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). 2. We analysed the clinical, cytogenetic characteristics and survival of 2080 MDS patients by statistical methods. Results: 1. According to the FAB criterion: 1040 (50.0%) patients with RA, 135 (6.5%) patients with RARS, 691 (33.2%) patients with RAEB, 145 (7.0%) patients with RAEB-t, and 69 (3.3%) patients with CMML. The median age was 51 years old (range, 5-93 years old). The ratio of male and female was 1.54. 40.3%(839/2080) patients had clonal chromosome abnormalities, in which 277 (13.3%) patients with complexed karyotype. The rate of karyotype abnormalities was higher in RAEB than that in other subtypes. Survival analysis show that the subgroup with RA had a longer median survival duration than the subgroup with RAS, RAEB, RAEB-t, their median survival duration was 50 months, 32 months, 13months and 16 months, respectively. 2. According to the WHO (2008) criterion: 220 patients (14.7%) with RA/RN/RT/RCUD, 75 patients (5.0%) with RARS, 385 patient (25.8%) with RCMD, 14 patient (0.9%) with 5q- syndrome, 282 patients (18.9%) with RAEB-1, 306 patients (20.5%) with RAEB-2, 211 patients (14.1%) with MDS-U. The ratio of male and female was 1.51 (898/595) and the median age was 54 years old (range, 6-93 years old). In all patients, the median hemoglobin level was 70g/L (11~167 g/L), the median platelet count was 51.5\u00d710 9 /L (2~1045 \u00d710 9 /L) and the median WBC count was 2.65\u00d7109/L (0.11~52\u00d710 9 /L). The rate of clonal chromosome abnormalities was 42.1% (628/1493), in which 216 (14.5%) patients with complexed karyotype. There was statistically significant difference in the rate of chromosomal abnormalities among different subtypes (P<0.01). RA/RN/RT/RCUD had a longer median survival duration than other subgroups, in order of MDS-U, RCMD, RARS, RAEB-1 and RAEB-2. 3. Among 2080 patients, 839 patients with clonal chromosome abnormalities. chromosome aberration types mainly uneven anomalies, the most common trisomies or monomer. The most common abnormity was +8. Other aberrations in frequent order was -7/del(7q), del(20q), del(5q), and so on. 4. Stastistics for survival, 550 patients' outcomes were evaluated according to the IPSS, WPSS and IPSS-R. The results show the IPSS, WPSS and IPSS-R score were significantly affected OS (P<0.001). When comparing the prognostic value of the IPSS, WPSS, and IPSS-R, using the Cox regression model, a significantly higher predictive power for OS became evident for the IPSS-R, compared with the IPSS and WPSS. Conclusion: 1. In our study, the MDS patients showed the unique clinical and biological features. We found that the characteristics of cytogenetics has significant differences from western MDS patients. The most common abnormity was +8. Other aberrations in frequent order was -7/del(7q), del(20q), del(5q), and so on. 2. IPSS-R is a powerful tool in MDS survival analysis. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
