JCO 2009)). There were no dose limiting toxicities (DLT) observed. No other MF-features (splenomegaly, fibrosis) were identified/improved even at the highest dose. We performed a subsequent dose-escalation trial to determine whether higher doses of POM are effective and well tolerated. METHODS: The trial was classic 3 \u00d7 3 design on pts with symptomatic MF (anemia and/or symptomatic splenomegaly). POM was started at dose of 2.5 mg/days (d) for 21 d every 28 d. Dose increased in cohorts by 0.5 mg/d were done if no subject had a DLT (\u2265grade-4 hematologic toxicity, \u2265grade-3 febrile neutropenia or \u2265grade-3 non-hematologic toxicity) in cycle-1. Subsequent cohorts were enrolled until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached (dose level before that resulting in DLT in >1 of 6 subjects). In the phase 2 portion, subjects were treated at the MTD, those without response at the MTD after 3 cycles were lowered to the minimal effective dose (MED) of 0.5mg/d. RESULTS: Subjects: 19 subjects with MF were enrolled 06/2008-03/2009. 14 had primary MF, 3 post-polycythemia vera MF, and 2 post-essential thrombocythemia MF. Median age was 67 y (range, 43-83 y), 11 were female (58%). 16 had a JAK2-V617F mutation. 11 were RBC-transfusion\u2013dependent (58%). 16 subjects had palpable splenomegaly, median 12.5 cm below the LCM (range, 1-26 cm). Median time since diagnosis was 24 mo (range, 1-173 mo). 15 were considered intermediate-high risk by IWG-MRT IPSS (Cervantes et al, Blood, 2009). Phase-1: 3 subjects each were enrolled at the 2.5 mg/d, 3.0 g/d, and 3.5 g/d mg dose cohorts. A DLT (bone marrow suppression) was seen at the 3.5 mg/d level. 3 additional subjects received 3.0 mg/d level cohort confirming this dose as the MTD. Phase-2: 10 additional subjects were enrolled at the MTD of 3.0mg/d. No improvement in anemia was seen, possibly because of bone marrow suppression. Consequently, the dose was decreased to 0.5mg/d in 7 subjects (2 remain on 3.0mg). 9 subjects remain on POM (all but 2 at 0.5mg/d. 104 cycles have been given (median, 4/ subject; range, 2-11). 10 subjects, all at \u22652.5mg/d discontinued because of lack of response/ withdrawal of consent (N=5), progression (N=4) or unrelated worsening co-morbidities (N=1). Toxicity: Dose-related bone marrow suppression was the main toxicity. 10/19 subjects had grade-3/-4 neutropenia (N=8) and/or thrombocytopenia (=3) and was only observed at doses \u22652.5mg/d. No substantial bone marrow suppression at 0.5m/d. Non-hematologic toxicity was uncommon at any dose level with grade-3 fatigue at 3.0mg/d in 1 subject. Efficacy: There was clinical benefit in 9 subjects. 7 subjects achieved an IWG-MRT response (Tefferi et al, Blood, 2006) including clinical improvement (CI) in anemia (N=6; rbc-transfusion-independence or hemoglobin increase >2g/dL for \u22652 mo) and/or splenomegaly (N=2; \u226550% reduction of palpable component for \u22652 months). 2 subjects had improved anemia below the IWG-MRT CI-threshold. Clinical benefit occurred after a median of 3.8 mo (range, 2.1-9.2 mo), and only after reduction to 0.5mg/d in 7 responders including both with spleen responses. There were 2 responses amongst 11 subjects receiving \u22652.5 mg/d compared to 7 of 8 subjects receiving '1.0mg/d. These responses occurred a median of 1 cycle after dose reduction (1-3 months). Responses were durable: 8 of 9 responders continue on-study. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with myelofibrosis, POM doses \u22652 mg/d are associated with moderate to severe bone marrow suppression. Response occurred at doses \u22652 mg/d primarily after dose reduction to 0.5 mg/d where bone marrow suppression was infrequent. The authors suggest 0.5 mg/d as the preferred doses for a phase-3 trial. Disclosures: Litzow: Enzon: Honoraria, Research Funding.",
