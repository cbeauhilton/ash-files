Arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 ) is a standard medication in the management algorithm of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). With the advent of oral As 2 O 3, outpatient treatment, convenient dosing and long-term post-remission maintenance therapy have become possible. The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety profile of short-term oral As 2 O 3 therapy are well-defined. With prolonged oral-As 2 O 3 therapy, possible accumulation of elemental arsenic and its possible long-term side effects must be determined. Materials and methods. Paired peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) (aspirate and trephine biopsy) specimens were prospectively collected as part of an oral-As 2 O 3 treatment protocol of patients. The samples were separated into plasma (P), white blood cell (WBC) and red blood cell (RBC) fractions. Elemental arsenic was measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, ELAN DRC plus 6100, PerkinElmer-SCIEX, Canada) after dilution with 2% nitric acid +/\u2013 3% methanol. Bone marrow trephine biopsies were dried at 65\u00b0C overnight, completely digested with acid, and diluted to appropriate concentrations. Results. There were 15 male and 11 female APL patients. Seven WBC specimens could not be analyzed due to inadequate material. Specimens were collected at 1 month (Group 1), 2\u201312 months (Group 2) and 24\u201341 months (Group 3) after cessation of oral-As 2 O 3 treatment. The median cumulative dose of oral-As 2 O 3 was 1980 (560\u20133680) mg. As control, samples were obtained from 12 anonymous individuals, whose specimens were collected as part of their diagnostic evaluations. These controls had no known medicinal exposure to arsenic. The mean elemental arsenic levels in the specimens were shown below.  Total dose . Mean elemental arsenic concentrations (nM/L) . Groups . As 2 O 3 . PB\u2013P . PB\u2013WBC . PB\u2013RBC .

However, groups 2 and 3 were comparable to controls, indicating that arsenic was rapidly excreted once oral-As 2 O 3 treatment was stopped. In group 1 patients, all specimens tested showed comparable arsenic levels. In group 2 patients, arsenic levels were significantly higher in BM\u2013WBC (but not PB-WBC) as compared with PB-P and BM-P (p=0.043 for both). In group 3 patients, all cellular specimens tested showed comparable arsenic levels to plasma levels. Conclusion. Immediately after cessation of treatment when plasma arsenic level was still high, elemental arsenic was distributed comparably in different compartments. However, when plasma arsenic levels started to decline, preferential concentration of arsenic occurred in the cellular compartments. This could be related to transfer of arsenic in bones to the developing hematopoietic cells in the marrow milieu. Finally, two or more years after cessation of As 2 O 3 therapy, elemental arsenic levels returned to control levels; a reassuring observation that long-term arsenic accumulation did not take place when oral-As 2 O 3 was used therapeutically during a finite period of time.
