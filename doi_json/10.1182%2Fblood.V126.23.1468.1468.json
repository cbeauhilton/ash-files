    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The standard treatment of B-NHL consists of rituximab in combination with CHOP (RCHOP) and results in a significant clinical response. Rituximab inhibits cell-proliferation and inhibits cell survival/anti-apoptic signaling pathways. A subset of patients does not initially respond and a subset of responding patients develops resistance to RCHOP. The genetic engineering of a fusion protein, \u03b1-CD20-hIFN-\u03b1, was found to be active in the rituximab-resistant B-NHL cell lines. Objective: To investigate the underlying mechanism by which \u03b1-CD20-hIFN-\u03b1 signals in the resistant lines. Hypothesis : We hypothesized that the treatment with the \u03b1-CD20-hIFN-\u03b1 may result in the cooperation of both \u03b1-CD20 and hIFN-\u03b1 and their interactions with corresponding receptors that will result in overriding \u03b1-CD20 blocked cell signaling. Methods : Rituximab-resistant cell lines, R-2F7 and R-Ramos, were used as models. Cell signaling was determined by western. Sensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis was done by activation of caspase 3 by flow cytometry. Results : Treatment of the R lines with \u03b1-CD20-hIFN-\u03b1 resulted in the inhibition of cell growth and sensitization to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Treatment with single agents alone or combination was not effective. Treatment with the \u03b1-CD20-hIFN-\u03b1 resulted in the inhibition of the NF\u03baB and the p38 MAPK pathways. In addition, the hIFN-mediated signaling pathway, namely, PKC-d, was also inhibited by the \u03b1-CD20-hIFN-\u03b1.The role of PKC-d in drug sensitization was corroborated by the use of the specific inhibitor, Rotterin, which reversed the drug sensitization by \u03b1-CD20-hIFN-\u03b1 and doxorubicin Conclusion : The ability of the \u03b1-CD20-hIFN-\u03b1 to inhibit cell survival and anti-apoptotic pathways, that was not achieved with single agents or combination, suggested that there may be a crosslinking of the CD20 and hIFN-\u03b1 receptors by \u03b1-CD20-hIFN-\u03b1 and results in triggering the cells via both receptors and inhibiting intracellular survival pathways and sensitization to drug apoptosis. Clinical Implication: The findings also suggest the potential therapeutic application of the combination of \u03b1-CD20-hIFN-\u03b1 and drugs for the treatment of patients resistant to RCHOP.
