    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2447 Poster Board II-424 Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) represents the most effective treatment for patients with high risk and relapsed hematologic malignancies. One of the major complications of allogeneic BMT is graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), which is caused by donor T cells reacting against host antigens. These same alloreactive donor T cells can provide a beneficial \u00a1\u00b0graft-versus-leukemia\u00a1\u00b1 (GvL) effect as well resulting in reduction in leukemia relapse. Because regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been shown to suppress GvHD while preserving GvL, their use in the allogeneic transplant setting provides a promising strategy to treat GvHD. However, three major obstacles prevent their routine use in human clinical trials: 1) the low circulating numbers of Tregs in peripheral blood, 2) loss of suppressor activity following ex vivo expansion and 3) the lack of Treg-specific markers to purify ex vivo expanded Tregs. Foxp3 is a forkhead transcription factor which is both exclusively expressed in Tregs and, when overexpressed in conventional effector T cells (Teff), can convert these Teff into functionally suppressive Treg-like T cells. The Foxp3 locus is unmethylated in Tregs while highly methylated and silenced in all other T cells. Several groups have shown that the hypomethylating agent azacitidine (AzaC) induces FOXP3 expression in non-Tregs. Furthermore, we have shown that treatment of anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-coated bead-activated CD4+CD25- T cells with AzaC results in robust and prolonged (>7 days) expression of FOXP3. AzaC-induced FOXP3 expression is also associated with a potent Treg-like suppressive phenotype in vitro . Thus, we hypothesize that AzaC treatment of mice after allogeneic BMT will dramatically mitigate GvHD while preserving GvL via transcriptional regulation of Foxp3 in alloreactive Tconv. In murine T-cell depleted BMT model (B6\u00a1\u00e6Balb/c; 900 cGy TBI) with delayed infusion of conventional T cells (Tconv) (2 \u00d710 6 ) at day 11 post BMT, followed by subcutaneous treatment of AzaC (2 mg/kg at days 15, 17, 19, and 21 post BMT), we found that AzaC dramatically suppressed GvHD caused by allogeneic donor T cells while maintaining donor (H2K b ) engraftment of all lineages. We found that the AzaC group had significantly higher FOXP3+ Tregs than in PBS control group and that these Tregs were derived from donor T cells, suggesting that the suppression of GvHD was mediated by AzaC-induced Tregs. We further tested whether AzaC treatment of mice transplanted with allogeneic T cells preserve GvL while mitigating GvHD. Using the same murine allogeneic BMT model, Click Beetle Red luciferase-expressing A20 leukemia cells (BALB/C derived) were injected with T-cell depleted BM and 10 \u00d7 10 6 Tconv and in vivo bioluminescence imaging was performed to assess tumor burden in vivo post transplant. We found that AzaC treatment mitigated GvHD without abrogating GvL ( Fig. 1 ) or donor engraftment. Thus, the adminstration of hypomethlating agents like AzaC in vivo after allogeneic stem cell transplant dramatically reduces GvHD while maintaining both donor engraftment and a potent GvL effect providing the foundations for future clinical trials.
