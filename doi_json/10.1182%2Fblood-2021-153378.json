    "abstract_text": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) often has an adverse prognosis and despite aggressive multimodal treatment with conventional and targeted therapies, the median survival of MCL patients remains approximately 4 years. Thus, there is a significant unmet need to find novel targets and rational combination treatments. Targeting lineage vulnerabilities driven by specific transcription factors has been broadly confirmed as an effective intervention in many human cancers. To identify the transcription program dependency of MCL cells, we conducted an unbiased domain-focused CRISPR-Cas9 screening against a library of 8,750 sgRNAs targeting 1,434 transcription factors in MCL cell lines (JEKO1, MAVER1, UPN1, and CCMCL1). We identified Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1), EBF1, PAX5, and IRF4 as 4 transcription factors that are specifically required for MCL survival and growth. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analysis further revealed that the four transcription factors act together to orchestrate B cell lineage transcriptional program and MCL cell survival. Despite its well-recognized role as a tumor suppressor, FOXO1 has been implicated as a lineage specific transcription factor involved in mature B cell development. Genetic studies revealed a critical role of FOXO1 in germinal center dark zone formation and lymphomagenesis, raising the possibility that FOXO1 acts as a master transcription factor for lineage survival transcription program of MCL. Indeed, hierarchical interaction analysis revealed that FOXO1 functions as a pioneer factor that facilitate the chromatin access of other B cell lineage transcription factors. We demonstrated that interaction of FOXO1 to its cognate motif stabilizes B cell transcription factor complex and supports MCL progression. Along this line, we show that enforced expression of FOXO1 in myeloid leukemia cells induces transdifferentiation and B-cell specific gene expression. Mechanistically, we demonstrate through tiling CRISPR scanning screen that forkhead DNA binding and c-terminal transactivation domains of FOXO1 are specifically required for the viability of MCL cells. Given our finding of FOXO1 as a lineage-specific oncogene in MCL, we next explored the possibility of developing FOXO1-tageted inhibitors. We screened a library of potential small molecule inhibitors of FOXO1 (Forkhead BioTherapeutics) and identified cpd10 as one of the most potent and selective FOXO1 inhibitors (IC 50 =76 \u00d7/\u00f7 1.7. nM) Through the CCMCL1 MCL-NSG preclinical model, we found that cpd10 (100 mg/kg/daily) was well tolerated without overt toxicities. Importantly, prolonged treatment induced a robust cytotoxic response of MCL cells and suppressed MCL progression in vivo. Altogether, our findings identified FOXO1 as a MCL lineage-survival oncogene that can be exploited as a therapeutic target of future drug development.
