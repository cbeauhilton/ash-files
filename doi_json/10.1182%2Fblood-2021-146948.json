    "abstract_text": "Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) such as the thrombin inhibitor Dabigatran and the coagulation factor Xa inhibitors Apixaban and Rivaroxaban have been in clinical use for the past 5-6 years. Familiarity with their use in the general pediatric population with thrombosis secondary to inflammatory disorders and rheumatologic disease is currently not as prevalent due to the widespread more conventional anticoagulation practice with the fractionated heparins in particular Lovenox. In this report we would like to summarize our experience in a pediatric patient population ranging from 3- 17 years with thrombotic disease. Of 55 patients with various thrombotic events 16 patients were treated with DOAC. There were 5 patients who had underlying inflammatory disease including COVID. Thrombotic complications included arterial as well as venous thrombotic events. All patients had elevated D-Dimer levels ranging from 360-4000 mcg/ml on diagnosis and normalized with successful anticoagulation. All patients had resolution of thrombosis. Thrombelastogram (TEG) were obtained on isolated patients during therapy and were useful to balance anticoagulation to prevent hemorrhagic complications. In conclusion, DOAC are a safe and effective alternative to LMW Heparin in pediatric patients with arterial or venous thrombosis. Monitoring should include determination of D-Dimer levels for efficacy of treatment and TEG in cases with arterial disease where bleeding may be a secondary complication of therapy.
