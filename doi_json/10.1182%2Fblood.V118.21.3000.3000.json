    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3000 Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains the standard upfront therapy of younger patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Identifying a prognostic threshold amount of mobilized CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (SC) may become an important modifiable parameter in the era of novel stem cell mobilization strategies. While poor mobilization of CD34+ cells has been shown to cause delays in hematopoietic recovery, the data on long-term clinical outcomes of patients with inferior CD34+ SC collection (\u2018under mobilizers\u2019) are limited. We analyzed prospectively collected data on 239 adult patients with MM who underwent ASCT at our institution from 01/1996 to 12/2009. Fifty-one patients (21.3%) who collected less than 4 \u00d7 10 6 /kg CD34+ SC were classified as \u2018under mobilizers\u2019 and were compared to the rest of the study population (n=188) who collected \u2265 4 \u00d7 10 6 /kg CD34+ SC. Even though under mobilizers were slightly older (median 59 vs. 54 years, p =0.01), had longer time from diagnosis to ASCT (11 vs. 8 months, p =0.05), and required more days of leukapheresis (5 vs. 3 days, p <0.001), they did not differ from the other group according to the number of prior treatment regimens, mobilization method (only 2 patients received plerixafor), performance status, or disease remission status at transplant (all p >0.2). Median time-to-recovery for both neutrophils (11 vs. 10 days, p <0.001) and platelets (13 vs. 12 days, p <0.001) was delayed among under mobilizers. Under mobilizers had worse relapse-free survival (RFS) (hazard ratio [HR]=1.49, 95% CI, 1.03\u20132.16, p =0.03) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) (HR=3.59, 95% CI, 1.51\u20138.56, p <0.01) in multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis. Even though the association between poor CD34+ SC collection and inferior overall survival did not reach statistical significance (HR=1.42, 95% CI, 0.94\u20132.16, p =0.1), under mobilizers were found to have significantly higher rates of 100-day post-transplant mortality ( p =0.02). We conclude that in the context of ASCT for MM, failure to collect \u2265 4 \u00d7 10 6 /kg CD34+ SC is independently associated with worse RFS and NRM.
