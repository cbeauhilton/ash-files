    "abstract_text": "Background Recently, direct thrombin inhibitors such as Hirudin, Bivalirudin, Melagatran and Argatroban have been introduced in the armamentarium of an antithrombotic drugs. Danaparoid, an anti-Xa - anti IIa agent is also used especially in Heparin induced thrombocytopenia. Objective Thrombin generation test (TGT) has been recently automated and could be useful for the evaluation of the inhibitory activity of these drugs and the measurement of their anticoagulant effects at established therapeutic concentrations. Moreover, TGT can elucidate some information about their mechanism of action. The aim was to compare Hirudin, Argatroban, Melagatran and Danaparoid while Bivalirudin was not available. Methods and results Pools of normal human plasma were spiked with increasing concentrations of the four studied drugs and TGT was determined by studying the lag time (LT) and time to peak TTP as well as the peak (P), the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and the mean rate of thrombin generation (velocity TG) and its inhibition once a maximal concentration has been reached (velocity TI). The mechanism of action on TGT was heterogeneous. At therapeutic concentrations, Hirudin delays dramatically thrombin generation without affecting significantly its velocity and the amount of thrombin formed. Argatroban and Melagatran induce a far less marked prolongation of LT and TTP than hirudin but they both reduce the velocity of the reaction and the amount of thrombin generated in this in vitro study. Melagatran was found more active than Argatroban but the patterns of the thrombograms were similar. Danaparoid exerts a minimal effect on LT and TTP which is associated with a very significant influence on the parameters related to the reaction of thrombin formation (velocity index, peak and ETP). In total ETP generally considered as the most informative parameter of the thrombogram was not found as relevant as predicted. Schematically, 3 different patterns for the thrombogram have been observed indicating different mechanisms of anticoagulation, all of them, clearly associated with an antithrombotic activity in vivo. Conclusion The mechanism of action of hirudin on thrombin generation is clearly different from that of Argatroban, Melagatran and Danaparoid. This work demonstrates that antithrombotic activity is associated with different alterations of TGT. The results could help to determine the blood concentrations required for an effective anticoagulation or reciprocally the alterations of the thrombogram which are associated with therapeutic efficacy. Moreover they could be useful when laboratory monitoring of the treatment with these different drugs is considered.",
