    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Impaired or inappropriate immune reconstitution after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) can lead to infection, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and leukemia relapse. We have previously reported that BM contains two populations of dendritic cell (DC) subsets, CD11b + DC and CD11b \u2212 DC, and that CD11b depleted donor BM promoted increased donor T-cell chimerism and increased graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) activity in C57BL/6 \u2192 B10BR transplants [BBMT, 2004, 10: 540]. To explore the mechanism by which CD11b-depletion improved allo-reactivity, we performed allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants using defined populations of donor stem cells, DCs, and T-cells in a MHC mis-matched BMT model. Methods: We transplanted FACS purified populations of 50,000 GFP + CD11b - DC or CD11b + DC in combination with 5,000 FACS purified Lin - Sca-1 + c-kit + hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and 300,000 or 1,000,000 congenic spleen T-cells from C57BL/6 donors into C57BL/6[H-2K b ], B10BR[H-2K k ] and PL/J[H-2K u ] recipients. Proliferation of CFSE stained donor T-cells was measured at 72 hours post-transplant. FACS cytometric bead array and intracellular cytokine staining measured serum and intracellular cytokines in donor T-cells. Results: The initial proliferation and Ki-67 expression of CFSE labeled donor T-cells in allogeneic recipients were much higher than in syngeneic recipients (homeostatic proliferation). Confocal microscopy showed co-localization of donor DC subsets with donor T-cells in the recipient spleens at 3 and 10 days post-transplant. In the allogeneic transplant settings, donor T-cells co-transplanted with CD11b - DC showed increased IFN-\u03b3 synthesis at 3 and 10 days post-transplant compared to donor T-cells co-transplanted with HSC plus CD11b + DC or HSC alone. Increased proliferation of donor T-cells led to increased donor T-cell chimerism at day 10, 30, 60, and day105 post-transplant among recipients of CD11b - DC compared to recipients of HSC alone or HSC plus CD11b + DC (Figure 1). Transplantation of spleen T-cells and CD11b - DC did not increase GvHD, but was associated with full donor chimerism. In contrast, transplantation of allogeneic CD11b + DC led to persistence and expansion of residual host T-cells (Figure 2), increased numbers of donor CD4 + CD25 ++ Foxp3 + T-cells, and higher serum level of IL-10 supporting early post-transplant expansion of donor T regulatory cells (Treg). Conclusions: Donor CD11b - DC promoted immune reconstitution by polarizing donor T-cells to Th1 immune responses associated with increased IFN-\u03b3 synthesis and donor T-cell proliferation, while donor CD11b + DC suppressed immune reconstitution by inhibiting donor T-cell allogeneic immune responses. These data support a novel paradigm for the regulation of post-transplant immunity and suggest clinical methods to test the hypothesis that manipulation of the DC content of a hematopoietic cell allograft regulates post transplant immunity in the clinical setting.
