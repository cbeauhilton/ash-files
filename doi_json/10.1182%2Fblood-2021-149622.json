    "abstract_text": "Background: RNA N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and determining cell fate. The dysregulation of m 6 A modulators, including \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), has been reported to promote tumor development through their enzymatic function. However, the functions of mRNA m 6 A and its modulators in multiple myeloma (MM) are largely unknown. Methods: We queried publicly available MM datasets to study the expression profile of m 6 A modulators (METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, FTO, and ALKBH5) in MM and their relationships with clinical outcomes in patients with MM. Both gain- and loss-of-function studies were performed to investigate the role of ALKBH5 in MM. The cell proliferation assay, colony formation assay, Annexin V apoptosis analysis, and 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay were performed to evaluate the functions of ALKBH5 in MM in vitro . Human MM cell line xenograft models were constructed to examine the effects of ALKBH5 knockdown or overexpression on MM growth in vivo . The rescue assay using catalytically inactive mutant ALKBH5-H204A was conducted to determine whether demethylation activity was required for the function of ALKBH5 in MM. Then, we performed RNA sequencing and m 6 A sequencing to explore the key targets that mediated ALKBH5 function in MM. We investigated the gene regulatory mechanism of ALKBH5 in MM by m 6 A immunoprecipitation assay, RNA immunoprecipitation assay, RNA decay assay, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and so forth. Gene set enrichment analysis and Western blotting were employed to determine the downstream signaling pathways regulated by ALKBH5 and the recognized target. Results: ALKBH5 was overexpressed in MM and associated with a poor prognosis in patients with MM. The increased ALKBH5 expression was required for the survival and growth of MM cells in vitro and in vivo . Mechanistically, m 6 A demethylation activity was required for ALKBH5 to exert tumorigenic effects in MM. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) was identified as a functionally important target of ALKBH5. ALKBH5 regulated TRAF1 expression via affecting mRNA stability of TRAF1 in an m 6 A- and YTHDF2-dependent manner. ALKBH5 promoted MM cell growth and survival partly through TRAF1-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways. Conclusion: Our findings showed that ALKBH5 played an oncogenic role in MM and highlighted that ALKBH5 could potentially be a novel therapeutic target in MM.
