    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3007 Background and Rationale: SIRT1 belongs to the silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) family of proteins and functions as NAD+-dependent deacetylase. Previous studies showed that resveratrol, a polyphenolic SIRT1 activator, inhibits tumorigenesis in various solid tumor and hematologic malignancies, including human multiple myeloma (MM) cells. This notion led to the discovery and development of more potent and selective pharmacological activators of SIRT1 as potential anti-cancer therapeutics. In this context, a recent medicinal chemistry research using high-throughput screening, and mass spectrometry identified SRT1720, a small molecule activator of SIRT1 that is structurally distinct from resveratrol. Here, we examined the anti-tumor activity of SRT1720 in MM cells using in vitro and in vivo model systems. Methods and Model: We utilized MM.1S, MM.1R, RPMI-8226, U266, KMS12BM, H929, and INA-6 (an IL-6 dependent) human MM cell lines, as well as purified tumor cells from patients with MM relapsing after prior therapies including lenalidomide or bortezomib. Cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis assays were performed using trypan blue, MTT, thymidine incorporation, and Annexin V staining. Signal transduction pathways were evaluated using immunoblot analysis, ELISA, and enzymology assays. Results: We first confirmed the functional specificity of SRT1720 against SIRT1 using different experimental strategies. First, we utilized Fluor de Lys Deacetylase Assay to measure whether SRT1720 affects the SIRT1 deacetylase enzymatic activity. Treatment of MM.1R and RPMI-8226 MM cells with SRT1720 markedly increased the deacetylating activity; conversely, pre-treatment of cells with nicotinamide (NAM) - an inhibitor of SIRT1 \u2013 significantly blocked SRT1720-triggered deacetylating activity. Second, immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific against acetylated p53 (a known substrate of SIRT1) showed a marked decrease in acetylated state of p53 in SRT1720-treated MM cells. These findings in MM cells confirm SIRT1 as a selective target of SRT1720. We next examined the efficacyof SRT1720 in MM cells. Treatment of MM cell lines and primary patient cells for 24h significantly decreased their viability (IC50 range 3\u20137 uM) (P < 0.005; n=3) without markedly affecting the viability of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting specific anti-MM activity and a favorable therapeutic index for SRT1720. SRT1720-triggered apoptosis was confirmed in MM.1R and RPMI-8226 cells, evidenced by a marked increase in Annexin V+ and PI- cell population (P < 0.001, n=3). Importantly, SRT1720 induced apoptosis in MM cells even in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells. Mechanistic studies showed that SRT1720-triggered apoptosis in MM cells is associated with 1) activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP; 2) activation of pATM, CHK2, endoplasmic reticulum stress molecules pEIF2, and BIP; as well as an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS); 3) inhibition of MM cell growth and survival pathway via NF-kB; and 4) inhibition of VEGF-induced migration of MM cells and associated angiogenesis. Importantly, blockade of pATM using a biochemical inhibitor KU-5593 significantly attenuated SRT1720-induced MM cell death (P value < 0.002; n=2). These data suggest that SRT1720-induced MM cell apoptosis is predominantly mediated by an ATM-dependent apoptotic pathway. We next examined the in vivo efficacy of SRT1720 using a human plasmacytoma xenograft mouse model. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with SRT1720 (200 mg/kg, 5 days a week for three weeks), but not vehicle alone, significantly (P < 0.008) inhibits MM tumor growth in these mice. Finally, the combination of SRT1720 with bortezomib or dexamethasone triggered synergistic anti-MM activity. Conclusions: These preclinical studies provide the rationale for novel therapeutics targeting SIRT1 to improve patient outcome in MM.
