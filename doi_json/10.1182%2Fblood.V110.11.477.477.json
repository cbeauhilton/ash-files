    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Filgrastim is widely used for mobilizing CD34 + cells into the peripheral blood that are easily collected by apheresis for allogeneic transplantation. With case reports documenting splenomegaly with life-threatening complications in normal donors, we prospectively evaluated spleen size using ultrasonography and clinical examination during PBPC mobilization and collection in a single-arm trial. Methods : Subjects \u226518 yrs eligible to be PBPC donors per institutional guidelines enrolled. Splenic assessments were done before, during, and after PBPC mobilization. Filgrastim dose and schedule and leukapheresis (LK) procedures were per institutional practice. The primary endpoint was fold change from baseline in splenic volume in post-baseline measurements during mobilization (measured by ultrasound [US]). Spleen size by US was measured in 3 dimensions similarly by all centers: longitudinal (craniocaudal), transverse, and diagonal (perpendicular to transverse in transverse image) diameters. Splenic volume was estimated by taking the cross-product of 3 dimensions and multiplying by 0.52, approximating the volume of an ellipse. Physical examination was performed on US days, assessing spleen palpability. US and palpation results were blinded from each other at assessment times. Timepoints included baseline (before first filgrastim dose), first LK (done before LK, typically day 4 or 5 of filgrastim), 2 and 4 days after first LK, and 7 days after last LK. Timepoints in the post-amendment cohort (n=219) were reduced to facilitate enrollment and were baseline and day of first LK (before LK). Results : 309 donors enrolled, median age 44yrs (range 18 to 74), 56% male. Mean daily filgrastim dose was 11.4mcg/kg (SD=3.0). Median number of LK was 1.5 (range 1 to 4). In all donors, the median increase in each measured dimension on first LK day was 1.4cm, 1.4cm, and 0.6cm (12.8%, 12.6%, and 15.0%), and the median fold volume increase from baseline to first LK was 1.47, resolving to near baseline 1 week after last LK. There was no apparent relationship between volume fold change and filgrastim dose, ANC, or CD34 + yield. Of 861 splenic palpation assessments reported in all donors, 98% were reported as nonpalpable (842 assessments), and 2% were palpable (19 assessments, 2 at baseline). Reporting of palpable spleens did not correlate with increased spleen size. Tenderness or guarding upon splenic palpation was reported in 2 donors with a spleen considered palpable and in 6 donors with nonpalpable spleens. No donor experienced a splenic rupture. Adverse events related to filgrastim were generally mild to moderate. Conclusion : During PBPC mobilization with filgrastim in normal donors, the spleen increased a median of approximately 50% from baseline to day of first LK and returned to near baseline 1 week after last LK. Size change was not associated with significant clinical sequelae.  Timepoint .
