    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a tumor of isotype-switched plasma cells that accumulate in the bone marrow, replacing normal plasma cells and leading to bone destruction and marrow failure. It is often preceded by a stable monoclonal gammopathy (MG) with limited (80%) than in those that express CCND1 (~30%). Although with largely redundant functions, CCND1 has additional ability to antagonize RB not shared by CCND2, suggesting that CCND2 tumors may be more critically dependent on the absolute level of RB protein. A variety of secondary genetic events associated with disease progression occur with a similar frequency in hyperdiploid and non-hyperdiploid tumors (17p loss or p53 mutations, RAS mutations, secondary Ig translocations, MYC translocations, and inactivation of p18INK4c or RB1). In contrast, a promiscuous array of mutations that activate the NFKB pathway are less common in hyperdiploid MM, which, nonetheless, has high levels of presumably ligand-dependent NFKB activity and appears particularly dependent on the bone marrow microenvironment. Both some of the primary (MAF, MMSET) and secondary (17p deletion) genetic events are associated with a poor prognosis with melphalan-based regimens and appear to benefit from the early introduction of bortezomib.",
