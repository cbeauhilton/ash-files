    "abstract_text": "Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks the autophosphorylation and activation of a number of kinases including the FLT3 tyrosine kinase with an internal tandem duplication mutation ( FLT3 -ITD). Sorafenib has activity against AML with FLT3 -ITD mutations as a single agent in the setting of post-transplant relapse and in combination with chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML. Historical Cancer and Leukemia Group B results using standard chemotherapy for older patients (pts) with FLT3 -ITD have demonstrated a complete remission (CR) rate of 67%, median survival of 0.8 yrs, and 1-yr overall survival (OS) of 30% (Whitman et al., Blood 2010). More recently, sorafenib was demonstrated to significantly prolong event-free (EFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of younger adults irrespective of FLT3 mutation status (Rollig, et al., ASH 2014). We hypothesized that the addition of sorafenib to induction and post-remission therapy would improve the overall survival of older pts with FLT3 -mutated AML. The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology conducted a multicenter, single-arm phase 2 study in pts \u2265 60 years old with AML and either a FLT3 -ITD or a point mutation in the activation loop of the kinase domain ( FLT3 -TKD). Subjects with PML-RARA, core-binding factor AML or who had received prior treatment for AML were excluded. Induction chemotherapy consisted of cytarabine 100 mg/m 2 CIVI on days 1-7 and daunorubicin 60 mg/m 2 IV on days 1-3 (7+3) with oral sorafenib 400 mg bid on days 1-7. Those not achieving a hypoplastic bone marrow on day 14 were to receive a second cycle of cytarabine and daunorubicin (5+2) plus sorafenib 400 mg bid on days 1-7. Post-remission therapy consisted of intermediate-dose cytarabine 2 g/m 2 on days 1-5 with sorafenib 400 mg bid on days 1-28 for 2 cycles followed by maintenance sorafenib 400 mg bid for 12 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint of the study was 1-yr OS. With a sample size of 39 FLT3 -ITD patients and type I error rate of 10%, this design provided 90% power to distinguish between true 1-yr OS rate of 50% compared to our historical rate of 30% for the FLT3 -ITD pts. A total of 474 pts were screened for FLT3 mutations though a central laboratory. FLT3 mutations were identified in 83 subjects (17.5%). Fifty-four pts with a median age of 67 years (60.3-82.7) were enrolled, including 39 with FLT3 -ITD (71%) and 15 with FLT3 -TKD (29%). All pts have now completed protocol treatment. Of the 54 pts, 37 achieved a CR or CRi (69%). The 30-day induction mortality was 9% with no additional deaths occurring between days 30-60. With a median follow up of 28.3 months, the observed 1-yr OS (95% CI) was 62% (45-78) for the FLT3 -ITD pts and 71% (42-92) for the FLT3 -TKD pts. The median DFS and OS was 12.5 mo (7.7-17.4) and 15.0 mo (10.4-20.1) respectively in the FLT3 -ITD group and 9.0 (1.6-NA) and 16.2 mo (5.0-NA) for the FLT3 -TKD group. For all subjects, the 2-yr OS was 28% (17-43) and DFS was 27% (15-46). There were no treatment-related deaths during consolidation or maintenance. For pts receiving sorafenib maintenance, the most commonly reported related adverse events were Grade 1 diarrhea, fatigue, transaminitis, and Grade 2 palmar-plantar erythodyesthesia. The mean plasma inhibitory activity (PIA) for FLT3 was 94% (n=25) on day 6 of induction, 93% (n=15) on day 15 of consolidation and 99.2% (n=6) on day 15 of maintenance demonstrating robust inhibition of FLT3 in vivo. This study represents the first prospective clinical trial for older adults with AML targeting a specific mutational profile within the US cooperative group setting. The study met the primary endpoint demonstrating that the addition of sorafenib to chemotherapy for FLT3 -ITD AML improves the survival of older adults more than doubling the 1-yr OS compared to historical controls (62% vs 30%, p <0.0001).
