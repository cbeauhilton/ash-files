During the pivotal trial in adult and adolescent previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A (guardian\u21221), subjects in need of surgery were able to participate in a subtrial to document efficacy and safety of turoctocog alfa in prevention of surgical bleeding. Pediatric (<12 years of age) previously treated patients in the guardian\u21223 trial were allowed to undergo minor surgery if needed during the trial. In addition, after completing these initial trials subjects were allowed to continue treatment with turoctocog alfa in the extension trial (guardian\u21222) which also includes a subtrial to document efficacy and safety of turoctocog alfa in prevention of surgical bleeding. Methods: We here describe surgeries performed within the guardian trials. For the ongoing guardian\u21222 extension trial, only cases included in the interim analysis (data cut-off 21NOV2011) are included. Results: In all, results from 10 major and 3 minor surgeries are included. Surgery indication was related to hemophilia joint disease in 8/13 cases. The hemostatic efficacy during and after surgery was rated on a 4-point scale (excellent, good, moderate and none) by the Investigator and/or Surgeon. Details and outcome of the individual surgeries performed are presented in Table 1 . In addition, there were no safety concerns. Table 1.

In the present 13 surgeries, including all surgeries performed with turoctocog alfa in the phase 3 guardian\u2122 trials, hemostatic efficacy during and after was rated as either excellent or good in each case. The results support that turoctocog alfa has an excellent safety and efficacy profile for use in hemophilia A.
