    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4990 Background: Although there have been improvements in 5-year overall survival (OS) rates among patients with AL amyloidosis over the past decades, OS is still poor, and death rates within the first 3\u20136 months after diagnosis have not changed significantly. This retrospective study was performed to identify risk factors for and causes of death during the first 90 days following diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. Method: From July 2002 to April 2009, 301 patients with a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis who were seen at Mayo Clinic within 30 days of diagnosis were identified from the dysproteinemia database. The 100 who died within 90 days were the focus of our study. The other 201 who were alive beyond 90 days were used as a comparator group. Outside physician offices were contacted to obtain further information pertaining to treatment and cause of death for our study group. Results: Of the 100 patients with early death, median age at diagnosis was 63.7 years (range: 34.7\u201389.4). 25 patients were diagnosed with concurrent multiple myeloma (MM) based on MM-specific end-organ damage. Overall, the number of patients with 2, 3 and 4 organs (cardiac, renal, nerve or liver) involved with amyloidosis was 37, 15 and 4, respectively. Using the cardiac biomarker staging system, 78% of 46 evaluable patients were stage III at diagnosis followed by 22% stage II and no stage I. Table 1 describes the characteristics of the studied population. Amyloid-related deaths were identified in 61 patients with the most common cause being cardiac arrest or sudden death (33%) followed by end-organ failure (24%). Treatment was started in 50% of patients; 34% received no treatment; and no treatment information was available for the remainder. OS was 54.5 days in patients who received treatment as compared to 7.5 days in those who received no treatment (p<0.0001); outcomes were similar in the group in whom no treatment information was available and those patients who were known to have received treatment. Melphalan with dexamethasone was the most common treatment (21%) and was associated with improved OS compared to other treatments including novel agents (57 vs. 26 days, p=0.003). Outcomes were no different if the patients had received novel therapies, but numbers were small. When compared to patients who lived for more than 90 days from their diagnosis, patients with early mortality had higher median intraventricular septum (IVS) (15 vs. 13 mm, p<0.0001), lower ejection fraction (EF) (50 vs. 64%, p<0.0001), and higher troponin-T (0.125 vs. 0.01 ng/ml, p<0.0001) and NT-proBNP (9020 vs. 1292 pg/ml, p<0.0001). We also found that patients who died within 90 days of their diagnosis had significantly higher plasma cell labeling index (PCLI), uric acid, beta-2 microglobulin, involved free light chain (FLC) and creatinine. Conclusion: This study highlights the characteristics of patients who died within 90 days of diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. The majority of patients died from arrhythmia and organ failure. This implies that other interventions aside from treatment of the underlying plasma cell (PC) disorder will likely be required to change the early outcomes of this disease.
