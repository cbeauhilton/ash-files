    "abstract_text": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma B cells (NHL-B), a lymphoma with increasing incidence over the last few decades. MCLs are classified into at least two subgroups, \u201cclassic\u201d type of MCL and \u201cblastoid-variant\u201d- an even more aggressive type of MCL. Both subgroups are incurable, unusually refractory to standard chemotherapy combinations and associated with poor prognosis. New therapeutic agents with greater efficacy and less toxicity are necessary in MCL. We have shown previously that in MCL cells, the key transcription factor NF-kB, is constitutively active and maintains lymphoma cells survival. We also demonstrated that treating the MCL cells with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) inhibits constitutive NF-kB activation, leading to G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Recently, a novel small molecular weight compound called WP-1066, a derivative of AG490, was synthesized by screening a synthetic library for agents that block stat3 activation. WP-1066 has shown to have anti-tumor activity in MCL cells through the inhibition of IL-6 mediated stat3 activation and NF-kB inhibition. A more effective compound called WP-1130, a derivative of WP-1066, was synthesized and is shown to be more potent than WP-1066 in MCL cell lines. Single agents are rarely effective in treating a disease like MCL; therefore, we hypothesized that the combination of bortezomib and WP-1130 would likely be more effective in MCL. We showed that MCL cells, both \u201cclassic\u201d and \u201cblastoid-variant\u201d, treated in-vitro with bortezomib in conjunction with WP-1130 resulted in a synergistic growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. The drug concentrations use for bortezomib and WP-1130 that produce the synergistic effects were in the low nanomolar (nM) and micromolar (uM) ranges, respectively. Bortezomib at a concentration of 10 nM induces approximately 15% MCL apoptosis after 48 hr treatment when compare to untreated controls, while WP-1130 at a concentration of 1 uM induces 5% apoptosis. The combination of bortezomib and WP-1130 at the same concentrations induces 60% of MCL cell apoptosis. Bortezomib and WP-1130 showed efficacy in both classic and blastoid-variant MCL cell lines. The apoptotic effects in these cells were correlated with the down-regulation of bcl-2 and the up-regulation of bax proteins. The status of constitutive NF-kB was also examined after drug treatments. While a single agent treatment with low drug concentrations had only minimal effect on NF-kB inhibition, the combination of the two drugs dramatically inhibits NF-kB activation. These two drugs also synergize to inhibit cyclin D1 (a molecular signature of MCL), and c-myc (an oncogene commonly over-expressed in lymphoma B cells). Agents such as bortezomib and WP-1130, that can pharmacologically modulate key intracellular targets such as constitutively expressed NF-kB and cyclin D1 in MCL cells, may be more effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of MCL."
