    "abstract_text": "Human myeloma cells from about 10% of cases with multiple myeloma expressed CD33 and have monocytoid morphology with convoluted nuclei, and all these patients had no increase in serum CRP values. In CD33(+) myeloma cells as well as myeloma cell lines, CD33 expression levels were correlated with the increased expression levels of CEBPA (C/EBP \u03b1 ) gene. This correlation was confirmed by the finding that transfection with the CEBPA gene induced CD33 expression in a CD33(\u2212) myeloma cell line. As suggested by the lack of an increase in serum CRP values in CD33(+) myelomas, IL-6 down-regulated the expression of CD33 in CD33(+) myeloma cell lines along with the down-regulation of CEBPA gene expression. Cucurbitacin I (STAT3 inhibitor) but not U0126 (MAPK inhibitor) could abolish the effect of IL-6. Furthermore, IL-6 up-regulated the expression of MYC via STAT3 phosphorylation and MYC bound to the promoter region of CEBPA gene followed by the down-regulation of the CEBPA expression. It was confirmed that introduction of shRNA for MYC into a CD33(+) myeloma cell line blocked the IL6-induced down-regulation of CD33 and CEBP A expression. Therefore, these results indicate that IL-6 can reverse the expression level of CD33 by up-regulating MYC followed by the down-regulation of CEBP A expression."
