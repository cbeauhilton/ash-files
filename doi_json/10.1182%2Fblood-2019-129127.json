    "abstract_text": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer and relapsed ALL is a leading cause of cancer-related death in children. While advances in frontline therapy have led to an 85% cure rate, relapsed ALL patients face a dismal prognosis necessitating identification of novel targets and development of alternative therapies. Amongst the two sub types of ALL, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) occurs less frequently but T-ALL patients have worse prognosis and higher rate of relapse. Our group discovered that the transcription factor KLF4 is heavily repressed via DNA methylation coinciding with aberrant activation of MAP2K7 and the MAP2K7 pathway ( Shen et al. Leukemia, 2017 ). Additionally, we demonstrated, as a proof of principle, that pharmacological inhibition of JNK, the only downstream target of MAP2K7, possesses anti-leukemic properties against T-ALL but presented obstacles in terms of low potency and off-target effects. In order to overcome these limitations, we hypothesize that direct pharmacological inhibition of MAP2K7 improve specificity for targeted approach to T-ALL therapeutics. To examine this hypothesis, we explore the anti-leukemic effects of the MAP2K7 pathway inhibitor, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, against T-ALL cells because it has been shown to covalently react with a unique cysteine-218 in the ATP binding pocket of MAP2K7. We found that T-ALL cell lines exhibit increased cytotoxic sensitivity to 5Z-7-oxozeaenol (IC50 ranging 0.2-1.1 \u00b5M) compared to a non-leukemic control (1.5 \u00b5M), and more potent than JNK inhibitor IC50 of 5\u00b5M. Additionally, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol reduces the amount of phospho-JNK, in a dose dependent manner, indicative of MAP2K7 pathway inhibition. We purified MAP2K7 protein to directly address specificity of kinase inhibition and found that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol inhibits enzymatic activity in vitro of MAP2K7. In addition, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol also inhibited TAK1, which is the MAP3K upstream of MAP2K7. In a panel of T-ALL cell lines, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol treatment induced apoptosis in MOLT3, Jurkat, and KOPTK1 T-ALL cell lines. Although P12-Ichikawa, RPMI-8402, DND-41, and ALL-SIL T-ALL cell lines underwent cell cycle arrest evidenced by a reduction in percentage of S/G2/M phase cells and increase in percentage of G0 phase cells, further increasing 5Z-7-oxozeaenol dosage proved sufficient for induction of apoptosis based on increase of caspase-3 and caspase-7 cleavage. Through reverse-phase protein array analysis we identified reduced expression of several cell cycle regulator proteins, including CDC25C, Cyclin B1, Cyclin D3, and CDC2 resulting from 5Z-7-oxozeaenol treatment. Conversely, we detected increased expression of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-7, particularly in MOLT3 and Jurkat cell lines treated with MAP2K7 inhibitor. Immunoblot analysis revealed that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol inhibits the MAP2K7 signaling pathway and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in T-ALL cells. Based on these findings, we demonstrated that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in T-ALL cells through inhibition of the MAP2K7 pathway, suggesting that MAP2K7 represents a novel pharmacological target for the development of targeted therapy for high-risk patients with T-ALL.
