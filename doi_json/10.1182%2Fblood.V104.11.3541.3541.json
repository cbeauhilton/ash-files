    "abstract_text": "Protein kinase C (PKC)-\u03b4 is a novel PKC that has been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated upon stimulation with agonists in platelets. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4 has been shown to occur in a Fyn-dependent manner downstream of glycoprotein VI (GPVI) signaling in platelets. Although thrombin causes tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4 in platelets, the mechanism of this event is not elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether G-protein signaling pathways utilize similar pathways as GPVI in tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4. Protease activated receptor (PAR) -1 selective peptide, SFLLRN and PAR - 4 selective peptide, AYPGKF caused a time- and concentration-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4 in human platelets. However, AYPGKF failed to cause tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4 in Gq-deficient mouse platelets. Both U73122, a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, and dimethyl-BAPTA, an intracellular calcium chelator, inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4 downstream of the PAR activation suggesting a role for Gq/PLC pathways and intracellular calcium in mediating this event. Inhibition of PKC isoforms using GF109203X potentiated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4. The Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PP1 and PP2 inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4 suggesting a role for Src family tyrosine kinase members in this event. We also found that both Lyn and Src are physically associated with PKC\u03b4 in a constitutive manner in platelets. Finally we found that there was a time-dependent activation of Src following activation of platelets with thrombin. Thus, the precomplexed Src and Lyn tyrosine kinases get activated following PAR stimulation resulting in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4. All these data indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4 downstream of thrombin occurs in a calcium- and Src-family kinase dependent manner in human platelets."
