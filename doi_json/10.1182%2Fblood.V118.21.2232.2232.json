    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2232 Introduction: Thrombocytopenia (TCP) is a common complication of cirrhosis in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections (Louie et al 2011); the presence of TCP impairs the ability to initiate peginterferon alpha (PEG) therapy and necessitates PEG dose reduction or discontinuation, thus reducing the potential for sustained virologic response (SVR). Eltrombopag, an oral, nonpeptide thrombopoietin receptor agonist approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, increases platelet counts in patients with TCP due to HCV-related cirrhosis (McHutchison et al 2007). ENABLE 1 was a phase 3, multicenter, two-part study of eltrombopag for the treatment of HCV-associated TCP. Part 1 involved open-label, pre-antiviral treatment with eltrombopag. Patients achieving platelet counts \u226590,000/\u03bcL were randomized in Part 2 to receive eltrombopag or placebo in combination with antiviral therapy (PEG-2a plus ribavirin). Aim : To assess the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag during the open-label, pre-antiviral treatment phase (Part 1) of ENABLE 1 in patients with cirrhosis. Methods : Patients with chronic HCV and a baseline platelet count <75,000/\u03bcL were enrolled. In Part 1, all patients received open-label oral eltrombopag (25 mg daily with dose escalations every 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 100 mg) for up to 9 weeks or until platelet counts reached \u226590,000/\u03bcL. Patients who failed to achieve platelet counts \u226590,000/\u03bcL following 3 weeks of eltrombopag 100 mg daily did not enter Part 2 and attended scheduled follow-up visits. Patients achieving these counts were randomized 2:1 to eltrombopag or placebo (Part 2) at the final dose received in Part 1, in combination with antiviral therapy for up to 48 weeks. Results : A total of 716 patients were enrolled; 1 patient withdrew due to a protocol deviation, and 715 entered the open-label pre-antiviral phase. At study entry, most patients were male (62%) and Caucasian (72%); 17% were of Japanese/East Asian heritage. The median age was 52 years (range, 19\u201376). 488 patients (68%) had cirrhosis (FibroSURE\u2122 score equivalent to METAVIR F4). The median duration of treatment during Part 1 was 20 days and the median of the mean daily dose was 25 mg (range, 0.8\u201375 mg). Median baseline platelets were 59,000/\u03bcL; these increased to 89,000/\u03bcL by week 2 and remained consistently elevated throughout open-label treatment (Figure). Following a median of 2 weeks of treatment (range, 0.1\u20139.6 weeks), 691 patients (97%) achieved platelet counts \u226590,000/\u03bcL. Treatment was discontinued during Part 1 for 33 patients (5%): platelets 200,000/\u03bcL. No thromboembolic events were observed during open-label treatment. Conclusions: Eltrombopag was generally well-tolerated and resulted in sustained increase in platelet counts during the open-label, pre-antiviral treatment phase. Platelet count increases were seen as early as 2 weeks following initiation of treatment. The vast majority of patients (97%) achieved platelet count increases to \u226590,000/\u03bcL, the threshold for initiating PEG-2a plus ribavirin therapy, and most did so within 4 weeks of initiating eltrombopag treatment.
