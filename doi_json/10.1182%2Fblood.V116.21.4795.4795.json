    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4795 We recently reported that the vascular reparative ability of diabetic CD34+ cells can be restored by transient inhibition of transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-b1) using antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (TGF-\u03b21-PMO) (Bhatwadekar 2010). TGF-\u03b21 mediates its action by binding to TGF-\u03b2-R2 receptor homodimers, which then form heterotetrameric complexes with two TGF-\u03b2R1 subunits. We investigated whether healthy or diabetic CD34+ cells differentially express TGF\u03b2R2 receptor and whether inhibition or knock-out of endogenous TGF-\u03b21 expression would affect the surface expression of TGF-\u03b2R2. TGF-\u03b2R2 expression of murine bone marrow (BM) lin - Sca-1+/\u2212 cells from TGF-\u03b21 knockout mice or wild type mice was studied using flow cytometry. Unexpectedly, TGF-\u03b2-R2 expression was essentially absent in BM lin - Sca-1 +and - cells from TGF-\u03b21 knockout mice compared to wild type cells. Because the absence of endogenous and exogenous TGF-\u03b21 resulted in complete down regulation of TGF-\u03b2R2 in primitive murine hematopoietic cells, we explored the relationship of endogenous TGF-\u03b21in human mature and immature CD34+ cells in blood, bone marrow and cord blood. Human CD34+CD45+ CD38+ or - cells from healthy and diabetic individuals were FACS sorted based on surface expression the analysed for TGF-\u03b2R2 expression. At the same time, TGF-\u03b2R2 and TGF-\u03b21 mRNA expression was determined for sorted populations using quantitative real time RT-PCR. A comparison of TGF-\u03b2R2 surface expression between mature progenitors (lin - CD34 + CD45 + CD38 + ) from diabetic and healthy cord blood revealed that TGF-\u03b2R2 expression did not differ between these groups. In contrast, TGF-\u03b2R2 surface expression in immature cells (CD34 + CD45 + CD38 - ) was very low in diabetic patients compared to healthy controls ( p = 0.001). Next, we inhibited endogenous TGF-\u03b2 1 in healthy CD34+ cells which resulted in a significant (p <0.01) reduction in TGF-\u03b2- R2 mRNA expression. However, in diabetic CD34 cells, TGF \u03b2 1 -PMO treatment abolished TGF\u03b2 R2 expression. Our study suggests that healthy and diabetic CD34+ cells differentially regulate TGF-\u03b2R2 expression which may be the result of the elevated intracellular and extracellular levels of TGFb1 in diabetic individuals. A reduction in TGF-\u03b2R2 expression in diabetic CD34 + CD38- cells may physiologically enhance proliferation of the primitive CD34+ CD38- cell compartment, an outcome that may be necessary to keep up with increased demand for CD34+ cells in the diabetic individual.
