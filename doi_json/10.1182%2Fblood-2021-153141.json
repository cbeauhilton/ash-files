    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Outcomes of patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remain dismal, with 5-year survival 90% of pts with B-ALL and is an established therapeutic target. ADCT-602 is an antibody drug conjugate composed of a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD22 and conjugated to SG3199, a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin. In preclinical studies, ADCT-602 demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in mouse models of B-cell malignancies. We present here interim data from an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial evaluating ADCT-602 in pts with R/R B-ALL (NCT03698552). Methods: This is an investigator-initiated Phase 1/2 trial of ADCT-602 monotherapy in pts with R/R B-ALL. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part is to assess the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ADCT-602. The primary objective of Phase 2 is to evaluate efficacy (CR/CRi rate). Secondary objectives include duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ADCT-602. Eligible pts must be \u226518 years of age with R/R B-ALL with bone marrow blasts \u22655%. CD22 must be expressed in \u226520% blasts. Pts must have adequate organ function (creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL; ALT and AST \u22642 times upper limit of normal (ULN), \u22645 times ULN if there is liver or bone involvement; total bilirubin \u22641.5 times ULN; LVEF \u226545%). In part 1, pts were assigned to treatment according to a 3+3 dose-escalation design. ADCT-602 was initially given IV once every 3 weeks; recently, based on the PK data, the administration schedule was amended to weekly infusions. Results: From November 2018 to June 2021, 14 pts (8 male, 6 female) with B-ALL have been treated with ADCT-602. The median age was 39.5 years (range, 22-82) and pts had received a median of 5 (range, 2-7) prior therapies [inotuzumab ozogamicin 10/14 (71%); blinatumomab 13/14 (93%); venetoclax 10/14 (71%); CD19 CAR 5/14 (36%)]. Seven (7/14, 50%) pts had a prior allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT), including 3 pts with 2 prior allo-SCT. The median pretreatment bone marrow blasts were 70.5% (range, 16-95). The median CD22 expression on blasts was 90.5% (range, 33.6-99.9). A total of 11 pts were treated in the Q3week schedule [30\u00b5g/kg, n=3; 60\u00b5g/kg, n=4; 90\u00b5g/kg, n=4]. As the PK data (shown below) indicated rapid clearance of the antibody, the trial was amended to allow for weekly dosing and 3 pts have been treated at 30\u00b5g/kg weekly dose level. No pt had a DLT. Two pts (one each at 60\u00b5g/kg and 90\u00b5g/kg every 3 weeks schedule) did not complete the DLT window due to rapid disease progression and were taken off treatment prior to day 28. One pt (in the weekly schedule) had grade 4 thrombocytopenia possibly related to ADCT-602. No pt had veno-occlusive disease. Two pts achieved MRD-negative remission. One pt was 35-year-old with R/R B-ALL (complex karyotype, NRAS mutation) with several prior lines of therapy (HCVAD, pegasparaginase-based therapy, allo-SCT, inotuzumab, POMP). Baseline bone marrow blasts were 87% with 99.9% CD22 expression. Pt received ADCT-602 at 30\u00b5g/kg Q3week schedule and achieved MRD negative CRp after Cycle 1 which improved to MRD negative CR after Cycle 2. He received a total of 6 cycles of ADCT-602 before transitioning to second allo-SCT. Another pt was 22-year-old with R/R B-ALL (complex karyotype) with multiple prior therapies (including 2 prior allo-SCT, CD19 CAR-T, inotuzumab, blinatumomab, pegasparaginase, venetoclax) received ADCT-602 at 30\u00b5g/kg weekly schedule. Baseline bone marrow blasts were 24% with 97% CD22 expression. Pt achieved MRD negative CRp after Cycle 1 and is currently receiving Cycle 2. PK data, available for 9 pts treated at every 3-week schedule [30 mcg/kg, n=3; 60 mcg/kg, n=4; 90 mcg/kg, n=2] showed rapid clearance of antibody with mean apparent half-life of <1 day during Cycle 1. This supported transitioning ADCT-602 administration to the weekly dosing. Conclusions: In this Phase 1 study in pts with very heavily pretreated R/R B-ALL with a median of 5 prior lines of therapy and high baseline bone marrow tumor burden, single-agent ADCT-602 was well tolerated with no DLTs noted. Two pts achieved MRD-negative remission. Dose escalation in the weekly schedule continues and 2 additional dose levels (40\u00b5g/kg weekly and 50\u00b5g/kg weekly) are planned.
