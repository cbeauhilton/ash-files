    "abstract_text": "Abstract 160 Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV-8), a member of the \u03b3-herpesvirus family of human DNA viruses, is the etiologic agent of several malignancies in immune-compromised individuals, such as Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). Activated NF-\u03baB is a critical mechanism by which lymphoma cells infected by KSHV are protected from apoptotic stress. vFLIP is the viral protein largely responsible for the constitutive NF-\u03baB activity, and is essential for PEL cell survival. Using a subclone of the BC3 PEL cell line that stably expresses firefly luciferase under the control of an NF-\u03baB promoter (BC3/NF\u03baB-luc), we performed high throughput screening (HTS) of compound libraries to identify inhibitors of vFLIP/NF-\u03baB in PEL cells. Assay optimization was done using the NCI Training set, following which screening of the NIH diversity set at 5\u03bcM picked up 60 hits (with >50% inhibition) from a total of \u223c2000 compounds. To further test these compounds, we introduced a renilla luciferase controlled by a constitutive promoter (retroviral LTR) to obtain a double reporter cell line (BC3-REN#3). Three compounds showed preferential inhibition of firefly luciferase in the double-reporter cell line, and/or preferential inhibition of the BC3/NF\u03baB-luc cell line when compared to a control non-lymphoid cell line with constitutive luciferase expression (U251-pGL3). Analogs of these three compounds were further tested in BC3-REN#3 cells, and three analogs were identified with increased activity/specificity for NF-\u03baB. One of the compounds identified so far, here designated NSC-E, has shown dose-dependent inhibition of NF-\u03baB in PEL cells, as evaluated independently by reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Nuclear translocation of the NF-\u03baB active subunit p65, but not inactive p50 is inhibited by this compound, although it does not alter upstream events in the NF-\u03baB pathway, such as IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 phosphorylation or I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. Studies are ongoing to elucidate the direct molecular target of NSC-E. Inhibition of NF-\u03baB by NSC-E occurs only in PEL cell lines, and not in other lymphoma cell types. In addition, this compound preferentially inhibits viability of KSHV-infected lymphoma cells, at LC 50 s ranging from 18nM to \u223c200nM in various PEL cell lines tested. In contrast, an effect on EBV-infected lymphoma cell viability is only apparent at much higher doses (LC 50 s in the 20\u201380\u03bcM range). Hence, \u223c300X the KSHV-effective dose of NSC-E would be required to achieve inhibition in EBV-associated or virus-negative lymphomas, suggesting this inhibitor is very KSHV-specific. Finally, NSC-E was evaluated in a traceable reporter xenograft mouse model of KSHV-associated PEL using in vivo imaging, and found to be highly efficacious against both incipient and well-established tumors, with 100% tumor responses and no apparent toxicity. Thus, we have identified a novel, specific, and highly effective inhibitor of KSHV-associated lymphoma that demonstrates clear pre-clinical promise for therapeutic applications.
