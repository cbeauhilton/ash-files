    "abstract_text": "Background: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an immune-mediated disease that is characterized by excessive platelet destruction and decreased platelet production. Although antiplatelet antibodies are considered as the primary immunologic defect in ITP, dysfunctional cellular immunity is also important in the pathophysiology of ITP. The current publications have observed excessive activation and proliferation of platelet auto-antigen-reactive CTLs, production abnormal Th cells, abnormal numbers and function of Tregs in peripheral blood of ITP, but no one focus on the bone marrow (BM) micro-environment in ITP patients. Many cell types including osteoblastic, perivascular, endothelial cells, and various mature immune cells contribute to the BM micro-environment. We have recently reported that the impaired BM vascular micro-environment may affect the thrombopoiesis of CD34 + cells by disrupting the interaction between megakaryocytes and BM endothelial cells (BMECs), resulting in the delayed platelet engraftment in allotransplant patients with prolonged isolated thrombocytopenia (Kong Y, et al. Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2014; 20:1190-1197). In mice model, the cross-talk between megakaryocytes and BMECs in BM vascular micro-environment regulates the megakaryocyte maturation and thrombopoiesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that the abnormal BM vascular micro-environment and immune micro-environment may operate in the occurrence of ITP. Aims: To investigate whether abnormal BM vascular and immune micro-environment are involved in ITP patients. Methods: The compartments of BM immune micro-environment were analyzed by flow cytometry in 26 untreated ITP patients and 26 healthy donors (HD). The fractions of T cells, including Th1, Tc1,Th2, Tc2 ,Th17 and Treg were identified as CD3 + CD8 - IFN-gama + , CD3 + CD8 - IFN-gama + , CD3 + CD8 + IL4 + , CD3 + CD8 + IL-4 + , CD3 + CD8 - IL17A + and CD3 + CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + , respectively. The BMECs and perivascular cells, acting as key elements of vascular micro-environment, were identified as CD45 - CD34 + VEGFR2 + and CD45 - CD34 - CD146 + , respectively. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using rabbit anti-human CD34 and CD146 primary antibodies were performed on each BM trephine biopsies (BMB) derived from the patients and controls. Results: The proportion of Th1 cells and Tc1 cells among the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) was significantly increased in ITP patients compared to HD (27.7% \u00b1 11.6% vs. 16.3% \u00b1 7.7%, P <0.001; 39.8%\u00b117.7% vs. 24.1%\u00b111.8%, P <0.005), whereas there was no significant difference in the percentages of Th2 and Tc2 cells. In addition, the proportion of Th17 cells in ITP patients was remarkable higher than HD (3.2%\u00b10.51%1.5%vs 1.7%\u00b11.0%, P <0.0001). We also found the significantly decreased percentage of Treg in ITP patients compared to HD (2.5%\u00b12.0% vs 3.7%\u00b12.6%, P <0.001). However, the frequency of CD34 + cells as well as BMECs and perivascular cells were similar in BM between the ITP patients and HD. Consistent with our flow cytometry data, histological analysis of the recipient BMBs in situ showed no significant differences in CD34-positive BMECs and CD146-positive perivascular cells between ITP patients and HD. Summary/Conclusion: The BM CD34+ cells and vascular micro-environment were normal in ITP patients. However, the abnormal BM immune micro-environment, including the excessive polarization of Th1, Tc1 and Th17 cells and a remarkable decrease of Treg cells were observed in ITP patients. Our data indicated that the desregulated T cells responses in BM may abrogate the thrombopoiesis through the impaired megakaryocytes maturation and decreased platelet production, and eventually contributing to the occurrence of ITP.
