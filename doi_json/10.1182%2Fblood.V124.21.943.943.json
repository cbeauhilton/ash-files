    "abstract_text": "Background The prognosis of patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following intensive chemotherapy (IC) is poor; furthermore, treatment options for these patients are limited. Few studies have assessed outcomes of azacitidine (AZA) in a relapsed/refractory setting. 1\u20133 Response rates and survival in these studies have been variable. Methods The Austrian AZA Registry was initiated to gain a comprehensive view of the use, safety and efficacy of AZA in a broad range of \u2018real-life\u2019 AML patients. The sole inclusion criteria were the diagnosis of AML according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria and treatment with \u22651 dose of AZA. Here, we assess clinical outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed AML (AZA 1 st line) vs patients with relapsed/refractory AML following IC and/or low-dose chemotherapy/other disease-modifying therapy (AZA \u22652 nd line). Results Baseline characteristics were generally comparable between patients treated with AZA 1 st line (n=170) and AZA after IC (n=127), or AZA \u22652 nd line (n=176), respectively ( Figure 1 ). However, pre-treated patients had a significantly lower proportion of patients younger than 75 years (18.9 and 29.0 vs 59.4% for AZA after IC [p<0.001] and AZA \u22652 nd line vs AZA 1 st line [p=0.001], respectively; Figure 1 ), as well as a lower proportion of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-related features (48.0 and 54.6 vs 71.2% for AZA after IC [p=0.003] and AZA \u22652 nd line vs AZA 1 st line [p=0.048], respectively; Figure 1 ) than patients treated with AZA 1 st line. Median time from initial diagnosis to AZA treatment was shorter for patients treated with AZA 1 st line than AZA after IC or \u22652 nd line (0.5, 9.2 and 7.8 months, respectively). Median number of cycles was higher for patients who received AZA 1 st line than AZA after IC or \u22652 nd line (6 [range 1\u201346], 3 [range 1\u201327] and 3 [range 1\u201335], respectively). Time from AZA stop to death was 1.8 months for the AZA 1 st line and \u22652 nd line cohorts, and 2.1 months for patients receiving AZA after IC. There was no significant difference in overall response rate (ORR) according to International Working Group (IWG) 2003 criteria 4 (complete response [CR] + CR with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi] + partial response [PR]) in patients treated with AZA 1 st line compared with pre-treated patients (24.4 and 22.2 vs 35.9% for AZA after IC [p=0.139] and AZA \u22652 nd line vs AZA 1 st line [p=0.072], respectively; Figure 1 ). Furthermore, rates of hematologic improvement (HI) according to IWG 2006 criteria 5 were also similar (53.2 and 51.0 vs 63.3% for AZA after IC [p=0.349] and AZA \u22652 nd line vs AZA 1 st line [p=0.250], respectively; p=0.463; Figure 1 ). When ORR and rate of HI were combined, the difference remained non-significant ( Figure 1 ). Median overall survival (OS) was significantly higher with AZA 1 st line than AZA after IC (12.8 vs 7.6 months, p=0.005) or \u22652 nd line (12.8 vs 6.0 months, p<0.001; Figures 1, 2a and 2b). Relapse-free survival was 8.9, 9.1 and 9.0 months for AZA 1 st line, AZA after IC and \u22652 nd line, respectively. In univariate analyses, baseline factors that significantly affected OS in patients who received AZA as \u22652 nd line therapy were peripheral blood blast count >0% (p=0.01), lactate dehydrogenase >225IU/L (p=0.012), and poor-risk cytogenetics (according Medical Research Council [MRC] criteria; p=0.011). Conclusion This study represents the largest cohort of relapsed/refractory AML patients treated with AZA, comprising almost four times as many patients (n=176) than the largest cohorts reported to date (n=47). Despite a shorter OS than patients treated with AZA 1st line, response rates in patients who received AZA as a \u22652 nd line therapy were encouragingly high and similar to response rates of AZA 1 st line patients. Median OS of 7.6 months in relapsed patients or those who are refractory to IC, which generally confers a dismal prognosis (median OS: ~3 months), 6,7 is promising. Thus, salvage therapy with AZA is a treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory AML, which should be further pursued in clinical trials. <1. Maurillo L, et al.
