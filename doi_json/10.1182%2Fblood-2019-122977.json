    "abstract_text": "Introduction)Somatic mutations in multiple myeloma (MM) are strongly related to the clinical outcome and clonal evolution over the clinical course, and are a major problem. From a clinical viewpoint, although numerous novel drugs have been utilized, achieving long-lasting and complete remission remains difficult. Recent studies have elucidated the mutated genes using next-generation sequencing, and have examined how clonal change can be acquired in myeloma. In this study, we traced the transition of the somatic mutations of bone marrow tumor cells in patients with MM over a long-term follow-up. Furthermore, we compared the somatic mutations found in serum cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and mutated genes obtained from bone marrow myeloma cells. Material and Methods)Patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma who provided written informed consent to participate in the study were enrolled. Patients were treated by immuno-chemotherapy with or without radiation between 2000 and 2017 at our institute. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed at the time of diagnosis and upon disease progression. Around the time of bone marrow aspiration, serum was obtained from a peripheral blood sample for cfDNA analysis. Myeloma cells were separated from bone marrow samples with MicroBeads of CD138 antibody and genomic DNA was extracted. The peripheral blood samples derived from myeloma patients. The cfDNA was extracted from the serum using a Maxwell RSC cfDNA Plasma kit. Using genomic DNA derived from cfDNA and bone marrow, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed, and a sequence library was then constructed with an Ion Custom Amplicon panel. The panel for the sequence library was designed using an Ion AmpliSeq Designer TM . 126 targeted genes were selected. The genomes were sequenced using the Ion Proton TM System. This protocol was approved by the institutional review board and the Genomic Review Board of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research. Result)We followed 7 patients' long term-clinical course and the transition of mutations (8.5 year average). The expression of myeloma driver genes, such as RAS, BRAF, and MYC, were not critical. We did, however, detect a relationship between an increase in the dominant mutated gene, such as TP53, DIS3, FAM46C, KDM6B, and EGR1 and poor prognosis in patients with myeloma. Next, we calculated the cfDNA concentrations from 34 cases. The cfDNA concentrations were significantly higher than 10 control cases (average 62.0 ng/mL (0-200 ng/mL) and 8.18 ng/mL (4.3-14.1 ng/mL), P =0.0046). The 2.5 year-progression free survival (PFS) during the first treatment of MM were tend to be poorer in the group with cfDNA>50 ng/mL (72.9%) than the group with cfDNA<50 ng/mL(25.9%), however there are no statistical significance ( P = 0.15).We caluculated concordance rate of derived mutations from bone marrow MM cells and cfDNA in 7 cases. The somatic mutations found in serum cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and bone marrow MM cells were determined the correlation coefficients. However, there are few difference expression pattern in each source. In cfDNA assay, CREEP, EGR1, HDAC4, HDAC6, and JMJD1C were highly expressed as 57.1% (4/7) - 85.7% (6/7), and these results were almost the same as those for bone marrow MM cells. On the other hand, KDM1A (85.7%), PI3KCD (71.4%), and KDM3B (57.1%) were highly detected in cfDNA, although those were not frequently expressed in bone marrow. Discussion)Our data demonstrate the importance of the long-term follow-up of somatic mutations during the clinical course of myeloma. Serum cfDNA is a useful alternative source for detecting somatic mutations in MM patients during long-term follow-up. Disclosures Mishima: Chugai-Roche Pharmaceuticals Co.,Ltd.: Consultancy.
