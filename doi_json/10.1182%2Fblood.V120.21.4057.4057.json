    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4057 Combinations of older drugs and novel agents are constantly improving the outcome of chemotherapy in AL amyloidosis. Bendamustine has demonstrated activity in multiple myeloma and Waldenstro\u0308m macroglobulinemia. In the present study we evaluated the safety and efficacy of Bendamustine and prednisone (BeP) in 36 patients with AL amyloidosis from two European referral centers, the Amyloidosis Center (Heidelberg, Germany) and the Amyloidosis Research and Treatment Center (Pavia, Italy). The databases of the two centers were systematically searched for patients with AL amyloidosis treated with BeP. Nineteen patients were treated in Heidelberg and 17 in Pavia. The patients received 28-day cycles of bendamustine (60\u2013100 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 2) and prednisone (100 mg on days 1\u20134). The target dose of bendamustine was 100 mg/m 2 , and lower doses were used in 20 patients (55%) who had baseline cytopenia. Ten patients (28%) had IgM clones. Of them, 8 received rituximab associated with BeP. Response was evaluated according to the novel criteria of the International Society of Amyloidosis. Patients' characteristics are reported in Table 1 . Severe (grade 3 or 4) adverse events (SAE) were observed in 33% of subjects, most common being cytopenia (17%). Other SAEs were fever (6%), portal vein thrombosis, skin rash, renal failure, and weight loss, in 1 patient each. By intention to treat, 17 patients (47%) achieved hematologic response, with complete remission (CR) in 1 case (3%), and very good partial response in 2 (6%). The median time to response was 3 months. The dose of bendamustine administered in each cycle was not associated with response. Three out of 5 treatment-nai\u0308ve patients responded. Interestingly, amongst the 8 subjects with IgM clones receiving BeP combined with rituximab, 6 (75%) responded (1 CR), including 1 out of 3 subjects who were refractory to previous rituximab. Amongst 10 patients who were refractory to melphalan, bortezomib and lenalidomide, 4 responded to BeP. Cardiac responses were observed in 3 patients (12%), two of whom also had liver response and one improvement of peripheral neuropathy. Overall, 12 patients (33%) died, and 65% of patients are alive after 3 years. Two subjects died within 3 months from treatment initiation due to advanced cardiac amyloidosis. A troponin I concentration >0.1 ng/mL or a high-sensitivity troponin T level >77 ng/L negatively affected survival (median 5 vs. 45 months, P =0.003). In a 3-month landmark analysis, response to BeP conferred a significant survival advantage ( Figure 1 ). Treatment with bendamustine is effective and well tolerated, representing an additional treatment option in AL amyloidosis, particularly as salvage therapy. Its use in combination with rituximab in IgM patients is very promising, and warrants further studies in prospective international trials. Table 1. Patients' characteristics  Variable .
