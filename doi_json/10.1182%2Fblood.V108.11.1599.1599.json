    "abstract_text": "Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate \u03b3-globin gene expression is essential for development of new therapeutic strategies for individuals with sickle cell disease and \u03b2-thalassemia. We have previously identified a tissue- and developmentally- specific multiprotein transacting factor complex, the human stage selector protein (SSP), which facilitates the interaction of the g-globin gene promoters with the upstream locus control region enhancer in fetal erythoid cells. This complex interacts with the stage selector element (SSE) in the proximal g-globin promoter, a regulatory motif phylogenetically conserved in primate species with a distinct fetal stage of \u03b2-globin like gene expression. Given these observations, we hypothesized that a similar complex modulates \u03b3-globin in the rhesus macaque, a non-human primate model that has been utilized to study \u03b2-globin like gene expression. We focused our efforts on NF-E4, given that a human isoform of this factor confers erythroid and fetal specificity to the SSP complex. Fetal liver erythroblasts were obtained from rhesus embryos and analyzed by reverse transcriptase(RT)-PCR analysis for NF-E4 expression. NF-E4 like transcripts were identified in day 60, 80 and 120 embryonic erythroblasts, but not other rhesus tissues, demonstrating an erythroid-specific pattern of expression. Utilizing 5\u2032 RACE, we cloned a full length NF-E4 transcript, identifying an open reading frame encoding a 131 amino acid polypeptide. This 20kD polypeptide shares a high degree of homology with human NF-E4, especially in its carboxy-terminal domain. Like human NF-E4, GST pulldown chromatography confirmed the ability of the rhesus factor to interact directly with CP2 and ALY, the other core components of the SSP. To evaluate rNF-E4 function in vivo , we utilized retrovirally mediated gene transfer to enforce expression of this factor in K562 cells, a model of human fetal erythropoiesis. Initial co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed the in vivo interaction of rNF-E4 with other components of the SSP. Interestingly, we observed a specific 3-fold induction of \u03b3-globin gene expression in rNF-E4 expressing cells when compared to controls. Moreover, we demonstrated that, like enforced expression of human NF-E4, rNF-E4 induced a significant increase in \u03b5-globin gene expression. Taken together, our results suggest a conservation of NF-E4 expression and function in species with a fetal stage of globin gene expression. Moreover, the identification of rNF-E4 provides a platform for the pre-clinical development of therapeutic agents that induce high levels of NF-E4 in adult erythroblasts.",
