    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Peripheral lymphocytosis encountered after myeloablative (MAC) or reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is an ill-defined feature. Most reports in the literature deal with large granular lymphocytes (LGL) expansions and only seldom of B-cell increases (Bellucci, Blood, 2002). With an incidence of 3 to 18%, LGL proliferations occur generally late after allo-SCT with a median onset of 9 to 16 months. Such expansions can be polyclonal, oligoclonal or monoclonal, arising from either CD3 + T-cells or CD3 - NK cells or both. LGL expansion has been frequently linked to CMV reactivation, indolent clinical course and a usually favorable outcome. Most available data were mainly described in the setting of allo-SCT using bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PBSC) as stem cell source. Here, we report data regarding the incidence and features of lymphocyte expansions after unrelated cord blood (UCB) transplantation. Patients and Methods : Ninety-nine UCB allo-SCT performed in adults between October 2005 and October 2014 were considered for the purpose of this study. Most patients received double CB units (n=94) and a RIC regimen (n=89), for various hematological diseases. Whenever detected, we collected the date of onset and termination of peripheral blood lymphocyte expansions (4x10 9 /L) among the 86 UCB-SCT patients alive at 3 months post-transplant. LGL expansion was defined as sustained LGL above 0.5x10 9 /L and/or >40% of LGL in peripheral blood (Zambello, Haematologica, 1998). Concomitant immunophenotypic results, allowed to discriminate expansions of cytotoxic T-cells (CD3+CD8+CD56+), NK-cells (CD3-CD16+/CD56+) and B-cells (CD19+). LGL expansion data were also analyzed with respect to viral reactivation episodes, acute or chronic graft vs host disease, relapse and survival. Results : Lymphocytosis was observed in 21 cases (24%; 10 females and 11 males; median age: 58 y., range: 32-69). Most patients had a myeloid-lineage disease (67%) and were in complete remission at time of UCB-SCT (76%). The median onset of lymphocyte expansion after UCB-SCT was 12.6 months (range, 1.4-49). The median initial lymphocyte count was 4.76x10 9 /L at time of expansion diagnosis. The median duration of expansion was 12 months (range: 1-52). Twenty patients could be further analyzed phenotypically, showing 8 CD8+ T, 1 NK and 1 T-NK LGL expansions. Interestingly, 7 cases of polyclonal B-lymphocytes expansions were also documented while 3 patients presented both T CD8+ and B expansions. Of note, B-cell expansions were CD5+. For 6 patients with T-cell expansion, concomitant DNA from CD3+ sorted cells is available to test clonality. Lymphocyte expansion were from donor origin for 12/14 tested patients. Acute and chronic GVHD developed respectively in 31% and 68% of lymphocytosis patients, and in 57 and 45% of the 65 patients without lymphocyte expansion (P=NS). Comparing these two groups for viral reactivations, the rates were 86% and 76% for HHV-6 (P=NS) and 23% and 39% for EBV (P=NS) respectively. CMV reactivation was significantly more frequent in the group of lymphocytosis patients (76% vs. 29%, P=0.0001). Interestingly, CMV reactivation was significantly higher in the 10 patients of the T or NK group compared to the 7 patients with B cell expansion (100% vs 57%, P=0.05). At time of analysis, 1 patient had relapsed and 4 had died, the causes of death being disease in 1 case and transplant-related mortality in 3. These events were significantly lower than in the group of patients without lymphocytosis (p=0.003 for relapses and p=0.04 for death). Two-year disease-free survival (Fig A) and overall survival (Fig B) were significantly different at respectively 85% vs. 55% (p=0.01) and 85% vs. 63%. (p=0.03). Conclusion : Lymphocyte expansion, at 24%, is not a rare event in adults receiving UCB allo-SCT. These expansions involve equally the T or B-lineages. The latter are often CD5+ suggesting a proliferation of innate B1 cells from the UCB. Lymphocyte expansions are significantly associated with previous reactivation of CMV, but not HHV-6 or EBV. Because these cells were of donor origin, it can be postulated that they represent primo-activation upon encounter with CMV. Finally, both types of lymphocyte expansions are associated with a significant favorable outcome, suggesting a possibly bystander anti-GVL effect. Figure 1. View large Download slide Figure 1.
