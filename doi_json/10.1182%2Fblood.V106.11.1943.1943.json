    "abstract_text": "Coagulation and platelet activation are involved in tumor growth and dissemination, and recent trials have demonstrated promising efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in cancer treatment. It is unclear, however, which subgroup of patients benefits most from anticoagulant therapy, although LMWH may be most effective in limited-stage malignancy. About 15\u201320% of patients with localized prostate cancer (PC) experience recurrent local and/or metastatic disease after radical prostatectomy. We conducted a prospective study to identify laboratory markers of hypercoagulability in early-stage PC, providing a potential rational for adjuvant anticoagulant treatment strategies in this tumor entity. In 98 consecutive patients with clinically localized PC (62\u00b16 years), we found significantly higher preoperative plasma levels of TF (median, 95 vs. 0 pg/ml), prothrombin fragment F1+2 (1.6 vs. 1.1 nmol/l), plasmin-antiplasmin complex (339 vs. 238 ng/ml), and D-dimer (0.27 vs. 0.17 mg/l) than in 42 sex- and age-matched controls (P200 pg/ml (high-TF, n=18). Compared to controls, median PMP numbers were increased 2-fold in low-TF (P<0.05) and 5-fold in high-TF patients (P<0.001). PMP numbers but not whole blood platelet counts were significantly different between patient groups (P<0.05). Compared to low-TF patients, high-TF patients also had elevated plasma levels of sP-selectin (37\u00b115 ng/ml vs. 23\u00b17, P<0.01) and sCD40L (361\u00b1817 vs. 47\u00b195 pg/ml, P=0.26), two markers of in vivo platelet activation. LMP were barely detectable in controls, and their numbers were only slightly increased in patients, representing not more than 5\u201310% of PMP counts. Using immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded specimens, TF was localized predominantly to tissue macrophages and adventitial fibroblasts but not to tumor cells, showing a similar staining pattern in both patient groups. In summary, laboratory evidence of coagulation and platelet activation is already present in early-stage PC. Although TF has been associated with a poor clinical outcome in various types of malignancy, its plasma antigen levels may not reflect tumor cell TF expression in localized PC.",
