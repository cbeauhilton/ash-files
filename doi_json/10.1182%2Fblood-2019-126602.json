    "abstract_text": "Objectives Chromosomal rearrangements of the human MLL/KMT2A gene are associated with infant, pediatric and adult acute leukemias. Such rearrangements are more frequent in infants, in whom they are found in 60% - 80% of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). KMT2A- r group itself is genetically heterogeneous. KMT2A -r can occur with at least 94 partner genes previously described in \u00abTHE MLL RECOMBINOME  IN 2017\u00bb. Detection of KMT2A-r is an essential part of AL initial diagnostics. Also, the accurate detection of all KMT2A-r types is crucial in order to perform minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring, as it is clear now that MRD-based therapy adjustment has a very strong impact on outcome. Here we report a case of novel KMT2A partner in pediatric ALL - NUT family member 2A ( NUTM2A ). Methods The patient is 8 y.o. girl with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with pleural effusion. Bone marrow and pleural fluid aspirates were analyzed by G-banded karyotyping and FISH with KMT2A breakapart probe. Pleural fluid aspirates were also analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for 8 most common KMT2A rearrangements screening, long-distance inversed PCR and targeted RNA-seq with FusionPlex Myeloid kit (ArcherDX, CO, USA). Sanger sequencing was used for validation. Results Conventional cytogenetics and FISH showed 47,XX,t(10;11)(q22;q23),+mar[5] karyotype with 100% KMT2A -rearranged nuclei. Gene fusion analysis identified novel fusion KMT2A-NUTM2A with exon 11 - exon 1 breakpoint junction. NUTM2A is a gene at 10q23.2. This gene is not fully described in the literature. Rearrangements of this gene were identified in endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS) (Cheng-Han Lee et al. 2012) and small round cell sarcoma (SRCS) (Sugita et al. 2017). In case of ESS, this rearrangement results in an in-frame fusion between YWHAE and NUTM2A (or highly homologous gene NUTM2B ), and in case of SRCS it results in an in-frame fusion between NUTM2A and CIC . To our knowledge, KMT2A-NUTM2A fusion in our study is the first case demonstrating NUTM2A rearrangement in hematological malignancies. Conclusions Here we for the first time show the novel KMT2A-NUTM2A fusion transcript, which was found in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Anchored multiplex PCR is one of the most sensitive way to detect rare variants of KMT2A rearrangements. It also allows selecting patient-specific primers for further PCR detection of MRD.
