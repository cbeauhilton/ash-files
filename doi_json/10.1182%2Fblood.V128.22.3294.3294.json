    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) remains largely incurable due to the emergence of therapeutic resistance. We therefore set out in this study to identify druggable molecular mechanisms that convey resistance to proteasome inhibitors (PIs; e.g., bortezomib/VELCADE, carfilzomib/KYPROLIS), which are cornerstone agents in the treatment of MM. In comparing isogenic pairs of PI sensitive and resistant cells, we observed stark differences in cellular bioenergetics between the divergent phenotypes. While glycolysis rates between cell lines were similar, PI resistant cells exhibited increased mitochondrial respiration characterized by higher basal oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and overall respiratory capacity. Additionally, PI resistant cells were found to have lower activation of the AMP kinase (AMPK) energy stress pathway and increased levels of NAD(P)H, which serve as electron carriers in the mitochondrial process of oxidative phosphorylation. We determined that glutamine was the principle source of fuel driving mitochondrial respiration as removal of glutamine completely inhibited OCR as well as cell proliferation, whereas glucose and pyruvate were dispensable. Given the propensity for mitochondrial respiration in PI resistant cells and the dependence on glutamine for this process, we hypothesized that targeting glutamine utilization by PI resistant cells would restore their sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of PIs. To test this possibility, we inhibited glutamine metabolism using the small molecule GLS1 inhibitor CB-839. CB-839 repressed basal OCR and total respiratory capacity and reduced cell viability to varying degrees in a panel of PI sensitive and resistant MM cell lines. Most notably, we found that CB-839 synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic activity of multiple PIs, including bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib, and oprozomib, in a genetically diverse panel of 15 PI sensitive and resistant MM cell lines. The effects of CB-839 were the most apparent in combination with carfilzomib (Crflz), where it enhanced Crflz-induced death by >4-fold. CB-839 enhanced Crflz-induced apoptosis as measured by the activation of caspase 3, 7, 8 and the cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate PARP. Mechanistically, the combination of CB-839 and Crflz induces a strong and synergistic ER stress response, characterized by the induction of ATF4 and CHOP. Our findings suggest that the acquisition of PI resistance may involve adaptations in cellular bioenergetics that may be exploited therapeutically by targeting glutamine metabolism. Furthermore, our results support the combination of clinical stage compound CB-839 with PIs, particularly Crflz, for the treatment of refractory MM.
