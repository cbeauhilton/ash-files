    "abstract_text": "Cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent production of prostaglandins (PGs) is known to play important roles in tumorigenesis. PGD 2 has recently emerged as a key regulator of tumor- and inflammation-associated functions. We previously reported that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) overexpressed COX-2 and secreted high levels of PGs including PGD 2 . Since little is known about the role of PGD 2 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis, we prioritized this mesenchymal source of PG for further investigation. We observed that AML MSCs or normal MSCs overexpressing COX-2 promotes proliferation of co-cultured hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), which can be prevented by treatment with COX-2 knockdown or TM30089, a specific antagonist of the PGD 2 receptor CRTH2. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PGD 2 -CRTH2 signaling acts directly on type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), potentiating their expansion and driving them to produce Interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13. We further show that IL-5 but not IL-13 expands CD25 + Foxp3 + IL5Ra + T regulatory cells (Tregs) and promotes HSCP proliferation. Disruption of the PGD 2 -activated ILC2-Treg axis by specifically blocking the PGD 2 receptor CRTH2 or IL-5 impedes proliferation of normal and malignant HSPCs. Conversely, co-transfer of Lin - CD127 + CRTH2 + ILC2s and CD4 + CD25 + IL5Ra + Tregs promotes malignant HSCP proliferation and accelerates leukemia development in xenotransplanted mice. Collectively, these results indicate that the mesenchymal source of PGD 2 promotes proliferation of normal and malignant HSPCs through activation of the ILC2-Treg axis. These findings also suggest that this PGD 2 -activated ILC2-Treg axis may be a valuable therapeutic target for cancer and inflammation-associated diseases.
