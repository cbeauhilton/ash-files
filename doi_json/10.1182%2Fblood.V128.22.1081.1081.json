    "abstract_text": "Despite superior outcome and survival of patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), relapse occurs in 10-20% and is associated with poor outcome, clearly indicating future challenges including reduction of relapse rates and effective treatment of reoccurred leukemia. Deficiencies in cell death and survival pathways have been implicated in therapy failure and treatment resistance in BCP-ALL. Members of the BCL-2 family are key regulators of these pathways and are therefore of interest as therapeutic targets. The small molecule ABT-199 binds selectively to BCL-2, inhibits its anti-apoptotic function and leads to release of pro-apoptotic molecules. Recently, ABT-199 has demonstrated clinical activity, particularly in poor prognosis CLL. However, insensitivity and resistance in different cases clearly emphasize the need of predictive markers for upfront identification of ABT-199 responsive leukemias. Here, we analyzed sensitivity for ABT-199 in a series of individual BCP-ALL samples, addressed mechanisms of resistance and evaluated markers indicating response to ABT-199. Anti-leukemic activities of ABT-199 were investigated in BCP-ALL cell lines (n=6) and patient-derived BCP-ALL primograft samples (n=17), which were established by transplantation of primary patient ALL cells obtained at diagnosis onto NOD/SCID mice. Half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for ABT-199 were analyzed for each sample. Expression of apoptosis regulating molecules was investigated by western blot analysis and associated with ABT-199 responsiveness. Two MCL-1 deficient ALL cell lines were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Leukemia free-survival of ALL bearing animals was analyzed after in vivo ABT-199 treatment. The majority of BCP-ALL samples showed sensitivity for ABT-199 induced cell death in the nanomolar range, both in cell lines (n=4, IC50: 29 - 422 nM) and patient-derived primograft samples (n=10, IC50: 1.7 - 74 nM), while 2 cell lines and 7 primograft leukemias showed insensitivity with IC50 values above 1 \u00b5M. ABT-199 binds directly to BCL-2 and upon binding, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family molecules like Bim are dislocated from BCL-2 and induce apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family member MCL-1 is not bound by ABT-199, but sequesters pro-apoptotic molecules dislocated from BCL-2 leading to interruption of apoptosis induction. Therefore, we addressed expression levels of BCL-2 and MCL-1. We found high BCL-2 levels in ABT-199 sensitive and low BCL-2 levels in resistant leukemia samples and an opposite pattern for MCL-1 (high in resistant and low MCL-1 in sensitive ALL), in line with previous reports. Most interestingly, a high ratio of MCL-1 to BCL-2 expression (high MCL-1, low BCL-2) was significantly associated with high IC50 values/resistance (Spearman Rho correlation, p= .01), whereas a low MCL-1/BCL-2 ratio indicated ABT-199 sensitivity. Two of the 6 cell lines showed ABT-199 resistance (IC50 > 1 \u00b5M) and high Mcl-1 expression. Effective MCL-1 knock-out in both cell lines led to a clear sensitization for ABT-199 with up to 40-fold reduced IC50 values, clearly indicating MCL-1 as a key mediator of ABT-199 resistance in BCP-ALL. Finally, we also evaluated the anti-leukemia activity of ABT-199 in a preclinical setting in vivo . Two patient-derived leukemias, one with a low MCL-1/BCL-2 ratio of 0.9 and the other with a high ratio of 16.1, indicative of ABT-199 sensitivity or resistance, were transplanted onto NOD/SCID mice and treated with ABT-199 for 10 days after ALL engraftment. Most interestingly, a significantly increased leukemia free survival was observed in ABT-199 as compared to vehicle treated recipients (p<0.001) of the leukemia with the low MCL-1/BCL-2 ratio, in contrast to similar survival times of vehicle or ABT-199 treated animals bearing the high MCL-1/BCL-2 ratio ALL, clearly showing the predictive value of BCL-2 and MCL-1 levels in BCP-ALL. Taken together, ABT-199 shows anti-leukemia activity in the majority of BCP-ALL samples, with a strong association of high BCL-2 and low MCL-1 levels with ABT-199 sensitivity. Silencing of MCL-1 clearly revealed a crucial role for MCL-1 as mediator of ABT-199 resistance. Importantly, in vivo evaluation of ABT-199 in a preclinical setting highlighted the predictive value of BCL-2/MCL-1 expression for the identification of patients who would benefit from future BCL-2 directed therapies.
