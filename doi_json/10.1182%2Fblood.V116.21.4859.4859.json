The constitutive STATs activation has been especially showed in transformation by fusion genes in leukemias. Methods: In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the genetic polymorphisms in the STAT5 gene are associated with the treatment outcomes of Ara-C-based chemotherapy regimens in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients. 152 AML patients in a Chinese sample were enrolled in our study. Peripheral blood samples were analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Results: The results showed that the frequencies of the T/T genotype in rs2293157 and rs1135669 were higher in unfavorable and intermediate group respectively ( P =0.023 and P =0.033). The frequency of patients with T/T genotype of rs1135669 was significantly higher in complete remission (CR) group. Conclusions: We concluded that the T/T genotype of rs1135669 might be an important marker for therapeutic efficiency of Ara-C-based chemotherapy in AML patients, especially in Chinese population.
