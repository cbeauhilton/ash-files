    "abstract_text": "Taliglucerase alfa, an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) approved in several countries for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease, is the first FDA-approved plant cell-expressed recombinant therapeutic protein for humans. PB-06-004 (NCT00962260) was a multicenter, open-label, expanded access study designed to follow the safety of taliglucerase alfa in patients with Gaucher disease who required ERT and who were previously treated with imiglucerase but had a dose reduction or discontinued due to a shortage of imiglucerase. Eligible patients (aged \u226518 years) with Type 1 Gaucher disease received taliglucerase alfa every 2 weeks for \u00b39 months at a dose equivalent to their previous imiglucerase dose, before it was reduced or discontinued (Part A), and had the option of continuing treatment for up to 33 months (Part B); a later amendment allowed treatment-na\u00efve patients. Fifty-eight patients received treatment (55.2% male, mean age 46.1 years, mean bi-weekly dose 35.2 U/kg, mean duration 17.8 months); 51 patients previously received ERT, 7 were treatment-na\u00efve. Thirty-six patients completed the study. Hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts were also explored. Most adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate in severity and not related to taliglucerase alfa; treatment-related AEs were mild and transient in nature. In previously treated patients, mean (SE) hemoglobin concentration was 13.0 (0.3) g/dL at baseline, 13.4 (0.2) g/dL at 9 months, and 13.4 (0.2) g/dL at last follow-up; mean (SE) platelet count was 179,242 (15,344)/mm 3 at baseline, 209,727 (17,157)/mm 3 at 9 months, and 215,242 (17,867)/mm 3 at last follow-up. In treatment-na\u00efve patients, mean hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts increased. In conclusion, taliglucerase alfa was well tolerated for up to 33 months of treatment and demonstrated a durable therapeutic effect, as evidenced by stable or improved hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts in this expanded access study.
