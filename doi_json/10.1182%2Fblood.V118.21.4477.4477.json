    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4477 Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkins lymphoma and they have shown the shorter survival compared with B cell lymphoma. High-dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT) for PTCLs has a potential meaning of consolidating remission for PTCLs. However, the effectiveness of ASCT on distinct conditioning regimens, the optimal transplant timing in the frontline or relapsed are still unclear. We investigated the clinical outcomes of HDT/ASCT as frontline intensification in 46 patients with newly diagnosed PTCLs except ALK(+) anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Patients underwent ASCT with a uniform conditioning regimen (busulfex, cyclophosphamide and etoposide). The median age was 47 years (17\u201365). The histological subtypes were 47.9% PTCL-NOS (n=23), 18.8% anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n=9), 4.2% angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (n=2), 25% extranodal NK/T cell, nasal type (n=12), 2.1% hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma (n=1) and 2.1% enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma. Thirty patients (62.6%) presented with advanced stage disease (III/IV) and 16 (33.3%) had B symptoms. At diagnosis, 21 patients (43.8%) were classified as high-intermediate/high risk by the age-adjusted IPI (aaIPI) and 10 (20.9%) were classified as high-risk (more than 2 factors) by the prognostic index for PTCL (PIT). Thirty-one patients (67%) could undergo HDT/HSCT and disease status at pretransplant consisted of 23 patients (50 %) with CR and 8 patients (17.4%) with PR. 6 out of 8 patients with PR at pretransplantation improved the response to CR after HDT/ASCT. There was no significant difference of the response rate between CHOP alone or CHOP-like chemotherapy and non-anthracycline-based chemotherapeutic regimen. At a median follow-up of 32.9 months, 23 patients (50%) are alive. The 5-year probability of overall and progression-free survival (PFS) was 48.2 \u00b1 8.1 % and 47.4 \u00b1 8.1%, respectively. However, the 5-year OS and PFS rate in transplanted patients was 57.3\u00b1 10.2 % and 55.3 \u00b1 11.3 %, respectively. Conclusion: Frontline HDT/ASCT in patients with PTCL could be performed with a high response rates and a substantial impact on improving outcome for PFS. Our findings also indicate that busulfex, cyclophosphamide and etoposide is a feasible conditioning regimen in ASCT for PTCLs. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
