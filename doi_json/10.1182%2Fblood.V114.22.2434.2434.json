CD3/CD19 depleted graft has been used in order to decrease the incidence of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, in the unrelated transplantation setting. Donor-derived NK cell alloreactivity has been reported to mediate early graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. NK cells are components of the innate immunity playing an important role in the surveillance of human tumors. NK cell recognition of malignant cells depends on a dynamic balance between activating and inhibitory receptors. NK cell alloreactivity can be predicted by donor Killer Immunoglobulin like Receptors (KIRs), Natural Killer Receptors (NCRs), C-type Lectin receptors (NKG2D), Toll Like Receptors (TLRs) and recipient human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles as ligands. Reduced risk of relapsed has been described in malignant cancer after haploidentical stem cell transplantation when HLA ligands against the inhibitory KIRs present in the donor were absent in the recipient (KIR\u2013HLA receptor\u2013ligand mismatch). We prospectively investigated NK function and NK reconstitution in 18 CD3/CD19 depleted graft unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (7 MUD and 11 HSCT) using fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning regimen. Results: NK cells peaked around day 30 after transplantation. The median number of NK cells on day +30 was 403\u00b188/\u03bcL . On day 100 after transplantation the median number of NK cells/\u03bcL was 221\u00b158. While the CD56bright NK cell subset was above normal during the first 100 days post-transplant, the \u201ceffector\u201d NK cell subset, CD56dim CD16bright, was significantly reduced early after transplantation. The median percentage of CD56bright cells among NK cells in peripheral blood was 25.8\u00b14.6% at day +30, and it was 24.5\u00b15.7 at day +100. The decreased in CD56dim CD16bright NK cell subset was correlated with the decreased of the inhibitory KIR receptors (KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2, KIR3DL1) expression. We also observed a lower expression than donors of the activating receptors NKG2D, TLR4 at day +30, NKp46, TLR 9 at day 60 and NKp46, NKp30 at day +100. Although absolute NK-cell counts rapidly increased after transplant, their cytotoxicity against K562 was much lower compared to that of their donors. At day 100 after transplantation, patients NK cytotoxicity was lower than donor values. These results suggest that the low NK cell cytotoxicity could be related to an \u201cimmature\u201d NK phenotype during the early period after HSCT. As other authors have published, activating receptors can be significantly upregulated in cytokine-stimulated NK cells. In our experience, overnight incubation with IL-15 overcomes this limitation, enhancing three times NK cytotoxicity, in vitro. Conclusion: The phenotype of NK cells and NK cytotoxicity ability are significantly altered early after allogeneic transplantation from unrelated donors using CD3/CD19-depleted graft. NK repertoire observed in patients was associated with the imbalance between CD56bright and CD56dim NK subsets and the expression of KIRs and NCRs. These data suggest a pattern consistent with an ongoing NK maturation after MUD and HSCT transplantation. In our experience, the phenotype and functional pattern of NK cells observed is suggestive of a cytokine-driven process. IL-15 stimulated NK cells could be helpful to optimize adoptive antitumor NK immunotherapy to enhance GvL effect as early as possible after transplantation.
