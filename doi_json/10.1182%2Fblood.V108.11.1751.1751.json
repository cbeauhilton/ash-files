    "abstract_text": "High doses of recombinant factor VIIa (FVIIa) have been found to bypass factor IX or factor VIII deficiency and ameliorate the bleeding problems associated with hemophilia patients with inhibitors. Recent studies show that FVIIa also acts as an effective hemostatic agent in other categories of patients, and thus has become a promising candidate for prevention and treatment of excessive bleeding associated with many other diseases/injuries. Although recombinant FVIIa has proven to be a very effective and safe drug in the treatment of bleeding episodes in hemophilia patients with inhibitors and other indications, a small fraction of patients may be refractory to FVIIa treatment. The reason for this is unclear at present, but it is possible that administration of very high pharmacological doses of FVIIa or use of genetically modified FVIIa molecules with increased potencies may circumvent the problem. The most dramatic effect on the activity (a 40-fold increase in proteolytic activity) of FVIIa was obtained by occupying the corresponding positions in thrombin/factor IXa for those positions 158, 296 and 298 of FVIIa (FVIIa DVQ ). A FVIIa mutant in which the hydrophobic residue Met 298 was replaced with Gln (FVIIa Q ) has 7-fold higher proteolytic activity. In the present study, we investigated the interactions of FVIIa Q and FVIIa DVQ with plasma inhibitors, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and antithrombin (AT) in solution and at the vascular endothelium. Both TFPI and AT/heparin inhibited the FVIIa variants more rapidly than the wild-type FVIIa in the absence of TF. In the presence of TF, TFPI, TFPI-Xa and AT/heparin inhibited FVIIa and FVIIa variants at similar rates. Although the wild-type FVIIa failed to generate significant amounts of factor Xa on unperturbed endothelial cells, FVIIa variants, particularly FVIIa DVQ , generated a substantial amount of factor Xa on unperturbed endothelium (1 nM of factor VIIa generated 0.3 \u00b1 0.15 nM factor Xa/h whereas FVIIa Q and FVIIa DVQ generated 1.26 \u00b1 0.1 nM/h and 9.48 \u00b1 1.32 nM/h, respectively). Annexin V fully attenuated the FVIIa-mediated activation of factor X on unperturbed endothelial cells whereas anti-TF IgG had no effect. On stimulated HUVEC, FVIIa and FVIIa variants activated factor X at similar rates (30\u201340 nM/h). AT/heparin and TFPI-Xa inhibited the activity of FVIIa and FVIIa variants bound to endothelial cell TF in a similar fashion. AT inhibition of FVIIa bound to stimulated endothelial cells requires exogenous heparin. Interestingly, TFPI-Xa was found to inhibit the activities of both FVIIa and FVIIa analogs bound to unperturbed endothelial cells. Despite significant differences observed in factor Xa generation on native endothelium exposed to FVIIa and FVIIa analogs, no differences were found in thrombin generation when cells were exposed to FVIIa or FVIIa analogs under plasma mimicking conditions, probably due to limited availability of anionic phospholipids and/or putative factor Xa and Va binding sites on their cell surface. Over all, our present data suggest that although FVIIa variants may generate factor Xa on native endothelium, the resultant factor Xa does not lead to enhanced thrombin generation on native endothelium compared to FVIIa. These data should reduce potential concerns about whether the use of FVIIa variants triggers unwanted coagulation on native endothelium, and may facilitate the development of FVIIa analogs as effective therapeutic agents in near future for treatment of patients with bleeding disorders.",
