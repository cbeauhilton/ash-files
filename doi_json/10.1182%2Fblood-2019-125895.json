    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The GCLLSG has demonstrated the efficacy of a sequential therapy with bendamustine followed by obinutuzumab (or GA101; G) and ibrutinib (I) according to a \"sequential triple-T\" concept [Hallek M., Blood 2013] using a t ailored and t argeted treatment aiming at t otal eradication of minimal residual disease (MRD) in CLL [von Tresckow J, Leukemia 2019]. Here we present the results of the final analysis of the CLL2-BIG trial after the end of maintenance therapy. Methods : This phase-II trial investigated the efficacy and safety of a novel regimen for physically fit and unfit CLL patients (pts) requiring treatment, irrespective of high-risk genetics. 62 pts were to be recruited according to a predefined allocation for the two strata of first-line (1L) and relapse/refractory (RR) treatment. Six cycles of induction therapy with G and I were administered followed by maintenance therapy with continuous I and G every three months until achievement of an MRD-negative complete remission or up to 24 months. Pts with an absolute lymphocyte count \u2265 25.000/\u00b5l and/or lymph nodes \u2265 5cm were scheduled to receive two cycles of bendamustine before start of induction. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate 3 months after the start of last induction cycle administered; secondary endpoints included the best response rate, MRD evaluations as well as survival and safety parameters (graded per the NCI CTCAE v.4 criteria). Results: 66 pts were enrolled. Five pts completed less than two cycles of induction therapy and were therefore excluded from the full analysis set as defined by study protocol. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Of note, half of the pts had received prior therapies and two thirds had a high/very-high CLL-IPI. At the end of induction, ORR was 100% and 29 pts (47.5%) achieved MRD-negativity (<10 -4 by 4-color-flow cytometry) in peripheral blood (PB), as previously published. 59 of 61 pts (96.7%) started maintenance therapy. Response is shown in Figure 1 and was improved in 16 pts, with 6 pts (9.8%) achieving a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete recovery of the bone marrow (CRi) and 55 pts (90.2%) a PR by iwCLL criteria, including 54.1% patients who were lacking a bone marrow biopsy or CT scan but fulfilled all other criteria for CR/CRi (clinical CR). 42 pts (71.2%) were MRD negative in PB at the last staging during maintenance therapy. 11 pts discontinued maintenance therapy early due to AE (6 pts (10.2%)), progressive disease (PD), refusal of further treatment (2 pts (3.4%) each) or physician\u00b4s decision (1 pt (1.7%)). 15 pts (25.4%) completed 24 months and 33 pts (55.9%) stopped due to MRD negativity after a median time of 15.6 months on study. PFS and OS are shown in Figures 2 and 3. In 1L pts 4 PD (13.3%) and no deaths occurred while among RR pts 8 PD (25.8%) and 7 deaths were reported (3 due to infections, 2 due to progression of CLL, 1 due to comorbidity and 1 due to infection and unknown cause). Among pts who stopped treatment due to MRD negativity, 5 pts relapsed after a median duration of 16.4 months off treatment and 1 pt died after 8.7 months, respectively. During maintenance therapy, no grade 5 AE occurred. 151 (45.5%) of 332 CTC grades 1 - 4 AE were deemed as related to study drugs. Due to AE, I was dose modified in 26 pts (44.1%), G in 1 pt (1.7%). All grade 3-4 toxicities observed are shown in Table 2. Conclusion: The depth of response of the BIG regimen can be improved by maintenance therapy with I and G, leading to a rate of undetectable MRD in the PB in 71.2% of pts. Among 33 pts who discontinued treatment due to MRD negativity only 5 pts relapsed and 1 pt died so far. The data demonstrate that the BIG protocol using an MRD guided concept for treatment discontinuation yields very good results, in particular in 1L CLL pts.
