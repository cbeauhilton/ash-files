    "abstract_text": "Background Ponatinib is a potent oral pan\u2013BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with activity against native and mutant BCR-ABL. The efficacy and safety of ponatinib (45 mg once daily) in pts with CP-CML were evaluated in the phase 2 PACE trial. Objectives To review the management of treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) that emerged during therapy with ponatinib in the PACE trial. Methods A total of 270 CP-CML pts (267 in efficacy population) resistant or intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib or with the T315I mutation were enrolled in this ongoing, phase 2, international, open-label clinical trial. The primary endpoint was major cytogenetic response (MCyR) at any time within 12 mos. Safety monitoring included collection of AEs, and the following variables were evaluated: incidence, severity, time to onset, duration, and management. Select TRAEs are discussed. Data as of 01 Apr 2013 are reported, with a median follow-up of 20 (0.1\u201328) mos. Minimum follow-up for pts remaining on study was 18 mos. Results Median age was 60 (18-94) yrs; median time from diagnosis to first dose was 7 (0.5-27) yrs; 93% had \u22652 prior TKIs, 60% \u22653. Ponatinib demonstrated significant activity in CP-CML pts: 56% MCyR, 46% CCyR, and 36% MMR. At the time of analysis, 60% of pts remained on study. The most frequent reasons for discontinuation were AEs (14%) and progression (8%). The most common hematologic TRAE was thrombocytopenia (41% any grade, 32% grade 3/4). The incidence by time to initial onset is shown below ( Figure ). Pts experienced thrombocytopenia for a median total duration of 166 days (64% of whom had >1 event) and typically required dose modification: 13% drug withdrawn, 40% dose reduced, 29% dose interrupted only, 17% no dose modification. Among pts with thrombocytopenia, 27% required a platelet transfusion. Thirteen percent of CP-CML pts experienced treatment-related neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Figure. View large Download slide Incidence a of Select TRAEs by Time to Initial Onset in CP-CML Figure. View large Download slide Incidence a of Select TRAEs by Time to Initial Onset in CP-CML  The most common nonhematologic TRAE was rash (39% any grade, 4% grade 3/4), which includes erythematous, macular, and papular rash. Pts experienced rash for a median total duration of 65 days (46% of whom had >1 event) and most did not require dose modification: 0% drug withdrawn, 15% dose reduced, 11% dose interrupted only, 73% no dose modification. One additional pt discontinued due to grade 2 treatment-related exfoliative rash. Pancreatitis was observed (7% any grade, 6% grade 3/4). Median duration was 5 days. Pts were typically managed with dose modification: 5% drug withdrawn, 58% dose reduced, 32% dose interrupted only, 5% no dose modification. Treatment-emergent cardiovascular events were observed in 8% of pts and treatment-emergent cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular events in 11%. Cardiovascular events were considered treatment-related in 4%; cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular events were also considered treatment-related in 4%. The median time to initial onset was 9 mos for cardiovascular and 11 mos for cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular events. The median duration was 6 and 97 days, respectively. Management of pts with cardiovascular AEs: 20% drug withdrawn, 10% dose reduced, 40% dose interrupted only, 30% no dose modification. Management of pts with cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular AEs: 8% drug withdrawn; 8% dose reduced; 17% dose interrupted only; 67% no dose modification. Conclusions Ponatinib has robust antileukemic activity in heavily pretreated CP-CML pts (93% of whom received \u22652 prior TKIs). Treatment-related thrombocytopenia and pancreatitis generally occurred early in therapy and were manageable with dose modification. Treatment-related rash generally occurred early in therapy, was mild-to-moderate in severity, managed without the need for dose modification, and rarely led to discontinuation. Management of treatment-related arterial thrombotic events varied; pts with predisposing cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored closely and managed accordingly.
