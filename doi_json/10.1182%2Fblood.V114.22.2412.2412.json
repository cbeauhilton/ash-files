    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2412 Poster Board II-387 Acquired idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare form of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) resulting from excessive von Willebrand factor (VWF)-mediated platelet clumping and capillary occlusion in relation with an autoantibody-mediated defect in the VWF-cleaving protease ADAMTS13. So far, the mechanisms leading to the loss of tolerance of the immune system against ADAMTS13 remain unknown. The usually switched isotype of the secreted anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies implies a cooperation between T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes and thus a recognition by T cell receptors of ADAMTS13 epitopes bound to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. We therefore hypothesized that particular HLA alleles may be involved in the process leading to a loss of tolerance of the immune system against ADAMTS13. Particularly, alleles within class I A and B loci and class II DRB1 and DQB1 loci are those most frequently associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. We have compared medium resolution typing of HLA class I (HLA-A, B) and II (HLA-DRB1, DQB1) loci in 61 Caucasian patients with idiopathic TTP and a documented severe (<5%) acquired, autoantibody-mediated, ADAMTS13 deficiency to 132 healthy Caucasian volunteer donors Caucasian individuals and to 42 Caucasian patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) who displayed a detectable ADAMTS13 activity. The frequency of HLA-A, -B and -DQB1 alleles was comparable between patients with acquired idiopathic TTP, healthy individuals and patients with other forms of TMA. By contrast, the HLA DRB1*11 allele was observed in 62% of patients with acquired idiopathic TTP, whereas the usually reported incidence of this allele ranges from 13.5% to 24.5%, with the lower incidence in Asian/Pacific Islanders and Caucasians and the greater incidence in Afro-Caribbeans ( http://www.allelefrequencies.net ). Comparison to our group of healthy individuals confirmed this striking difference, which was statistically significant (20%, P = 10 -7 , odd ratio [OR] = 6.43, CI95% =2.3-12.7). The increased incidence of DRB1*11 in acquired idiopathic TTP was also significant when compared to patients with a diagnosis of atypical HUS (17%, P= 6\u00d710 -5 ). By contrast, DRB1*11 frequency in this latter group was comparable to this observed in healthy individuals (P = n.s). All patients were heterozygous for this allele. We also observed a decreased incidence of the DRB1*04 allele in acquired idiopathic TTP when compared to healthy individuals (10% versus 30%, respectively, P corr = 0.025). DRB1*04, resulting in the DR53 antigen when associated with DRB4, could thus be involved as a protective allele in acquired idiopathic TTP, as suggested in a previous work. We found no association between DRB1*11 and clinical features of autoimmunity, central nervous system involvement, antinuclear antibodies, anti-ADAMTS13 inhibitors, flare-up and relapse episodes and survival. Of note, the association between DRB1*11 with acquired idiopathic TTP was not observed in Afro-Caribbeans (3/12, 25%, p=0.04). High resolution typing of DRB1*11 allele revealed that both DRB1*1101 and DRB1*1104 alleles were significantly over-represented, suggesting that the generic DRB1*11 (and not the DRB1*11 alleles) is the predisposing factor. The DRB1*11 was reported to be a risk factor for systemic sclerosis, early-onset juvenile chronic arthritis and sarcoidosis, and protective against multiple sclerosis and pemphigus vulgaris. Accordingly, we found no patient with one of those 2 latter diseases in our French National TTP registry, whereas a past history of systemic sclerosis, sarcoidosis and juvenile chronic arthritis was observed in 1 case each. Our findings propose DRB1*11 as a strong risk factor for acquired idiopathic TTP in Caucasians. Indeed, the autoimmune response in acquired idiopathic TTP may involve the recognition by T cells of a class II region of DRB1*11, bound to a peptide fragment of ADAMTS13. We also suggest that acquired idiopathic TTP represents a subset of TMA with specific genetic risk factors, distinguishing it from the other forms of idiopathic TMA. The incomplete rate of concordance may be explained by other yet unexplored mechanisms, including additional predisposing genes and environmental triggers. Forthcoming genomewide association studies should lead to the identification of additional alleles associated with the risk of acquired idiopathic TTP.
