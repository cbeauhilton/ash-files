    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3671 Poster Board III-607 For effective elimination of malignant cells by specific T cells a co-activation of CD4- and CD8-positive T cells might be important. We performed two RHAMM-R3 peptide vaccination trials using 300\u03bcg and 1000\u03bcg for patients with AML, MDS and multiple myeloma overexpressing RHAMM. Similar mild toxicity of both cohorts was found, only mild drug-related adverse events were observed such as erythema and induration of the skin. In the 300\u03bcg cohort we detected in 7/10 (70 %) patients specific immune responses and also positive clinical effects in 5/10 (50 %) patients. In the high dose peptide vaccination trial (1000\u03bcg peptide) 4/9 (44 %) patients showed positive immune responses. These patients showed an increase of CD8+RHAMM-R3 tetramer+/CD45RA+/CCR7-/CD27-/CD28- effector T cells and an increase of R3-specific CD8+ T cells. In the higher peptide dose cohort three patients showed positive clinical effects. However, higher doses of peptide do not improve the frequency and intensity of immune responses in this clinical trial and might induce immune tolerance. In this work, we investigated the co-existence of serological immune responses against RHAMM detected by a RHAMM-specific ELISA of patients with AML, MDS and multiple myeloma treated in these two peptide vaccination trials. We correlated these results to specific T cell responses of CD8-positive T cells measured by ELISpot assays for interferon gamma and Granzyme B, tetramer staining and chromium release assays. Moreover, these results were compared to the frequency of regulatory T cells. 4/19 patients have a positive serological immune response in ELISA assay, all of these patients developed also strong specific CD8-positive T cell responses during peptide vaccination detected by ELISpot assays and tetramer staining. As expected, peptide vaccination did not result in the induction of humoral immune responses. In further ELISA assays we measured IL-2 and IL-10 levels in the sera of the patients before and three weeks after four vaccinations. While IL-10 levels remained at a rather low level over the time of vaccination, we detected an increase of IL-2 up to the five-fold of the initial levels in four of ten patients. Moreover, we performed a proteome array to detect cytokine and chemokine regulation in sera of patients vaccinated in these two trials during and after RHAMM-R3 peptide vaccination. 36 cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins were measured and both cohorts vaccinated with different peptide doses were compared. Taken together, RHAMM-R3 peptide vaccination induced both immunological and clinical responses. Co-existence of immune responses of CD4-positive T cells against the target RHAMM seems to be important for an induction of strong immune responses of CD8-positive T cells.
