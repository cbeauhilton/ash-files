    "abstract_text": "Background/Aims Placenta is a specialized organ which has a property of fetal and adult tissues simultaneously. Mesenchymal stem cell and hematopoietic stem cells have been founded in the parenchyma of placenta tissue contributed by fetal side. Recently, it was reported that placenta is a major hematopoietic organ contributing to both generation and expansion of multipotent hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We hypothesized that hematopoietic stem cells in placenta might be originated from another placental stem cells which has been so-called \u201cplacenta mesenchymal stem cells\u201d. To prove this hypothesis, this study is designed to induce in vitro differentiation of placental stem cells into the hematopoietic stem cells without genetic transduction. Methods Placental stem cells was obtained from surgically isolated placental chorionic plates from healthy women who had undergone abortion at 6-8 weeks of gestation. To prevent the contamination of hematopoietic stem cells, CD34 - CD44 + cells were purified by flowcytometric isolation. After mesenchymal differentiation potential was identified in these cells by induction of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, they were cultured in vitro with serum-free media including cytokine cocktail which was known to induce differentiation of embryonic stem cells into hematopoietic lineage (erythropoietin, Flt-3/Flk-2 ligand, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6/7/15, stem cell factor, and thrombopoietin). In vitro differentiation was performed in conventional cell culture dish (group 1) and Ultra-low attachment dish (group2) for 3 weeks, respectively ( Figure 1 ). Expression of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell markers were analyzed at every 1 week.

In group 2 (Ultra-low attachment dish), expression of pan-hematopoietic markers, CD34 and CD45 was also not observed. However, after 2 weeks of differentiation induction, red cells aggregates and expression of erythroid-lineage markers (CD235a and CD38) were detected in cells cultured using high concentration cytokines (Media 3 in Figure 1 ). The proportion of cells expressing erythroid-lineage markers became increased during in vitro differentiation ( Figure 2 ).

Therefore, placenta-derived stem cells which have been so-called \u201cplacenta mesenchymal stem cells\u201d is considered to be a distinct stem cell population including property of erythroid progenitor cells.
