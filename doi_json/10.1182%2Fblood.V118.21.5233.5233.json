    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5233 Introduction In Activated B-Cell like Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas (ABC DLBCLs) the most commonly affected gene is TNFAIP3 , which encodes A20, an ubiquitin modifying enzyme involved in the negative regulation of NF-\u03baB signaling. A20 is itself a target gene of NF-\u03baB and needs to be induced in order to exert its negative feedback effect on NF-\u03baB. Mutations resulting in the inactivation of A20 have been found in a significant proportion of ABC DLBCL cases (Compagno M et al, Nature 2009). The tumor suppressor role of A20 was established by the reintroduction of wild-type A20 in some mutant A20 lymphoma B-cell lines promoting apoptosis, supposedly due to the loss of the ability to inactivate NF-\u03baB. However, a protective effect of A20 against apoptotic stimuli was demonstrated in some cell types. In endothelial cells, A20 protects from TNF- and Fas-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-8 activation (Daniel S et al, Blood 2004). We thus wanted to understand the relationship between A20 expression, NF-\u03baB activation and protection against apoptosis in B-cells. Methods We have cloned cDNAs coding for wild-type A20 (A20wt), for I\u03baB\u03b1 S32,36A (constitutively active form of I\u03baB\u03b1), and for luciferase (as a control) into a doxycycline double-inducible episomal vector pRT-1, and stably transfected these vectors into an EBV positive lymphoblastoid B-cells line. Induction of p53 mediated apoptosis was performed by treatment of cells with Fludarabine*, whereas induction of caspase-8 dependant was performed with agonist antibodies against Fas (CD95). Results Both A20 and I\u03baB\u03b1 S32,36A overexpression suppressed NF-\u03baB activity with downregulation of NF-\u03baB target genes. Loss of NF-\u03baB activation by induction of I\u03baB\u03b1 S32,36A led to increase of spontaneous apoptosis. Oppositely, loss of NF-\u03baB activation by induction of A20 led to decrease of spontaneous apoptosis. Compared with luciferase transfected cells, no effect of A20 overexpression was seen after treatment of cells with anti-CD95 antibodies. Caspase-9 cleavage was significantly decreased and increase of TP53 protein levels was lower in A20 overexpressing cells after Fludarabine* treatment. By contrast, Fludarabine* treatment of I\u03baB\u03b1 S32,36A expressing cells led to an increase of both TP53 protein levels and caspase-9 cleavage. Therefore, A20 negatively modulated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway despite NF-\u03baB downregulation. Conclusions These results suggest that A20 may exert an anti-apoptotic effect on its own independently of NF-\u03baB activation. We are now looking after the functional properties of A20 natural mutants. Indeed, we can hypothesize that A20 mutants described in ABC DLBCLs have lost their negative feedback effect on NF-\u03baB, but not their protective effect against apoptosis. So, A20 mutants may actively contribute to oncogenesis through their own protective effect on tumor cells. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
