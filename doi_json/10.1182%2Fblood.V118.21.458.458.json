    "abstract_text": "Abstract 458 MDS and related disorders comprise a group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by deregulated blood cell production and a predisposition to AML. Although currently, a number of gene alterations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS, they do not fully explain the pathogenesis of MDS, because many of them are also found in other myeloid malignancies and roughly 20% of MDS cases have no known genetic changes. So, in order to clarify a complete registry of gene mutations in MDS and identify those discriminate MDS from other myeloid neoplasms, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 29 cases showing myelodysplasia. A total of 268 somatic mutations or 9.2 mutations per sample were identified. Among these 41 occurred in recurrent gene targets, which not only included a spectrum of known gene targets in MDS, such as TET2 , EZH2 , NRAS/KRAS , RUNX1 , TP53 and DNMT3A , but also affected previously unknown genes that are commonly mapped to the RNA splicing pathway, including U2AF35, SRSF2 and ZRSR2 . Together with additional three (SF3A1, SF3B1 and PRPF40B) found in single cases, 16 (55.2%) of the 29 discovery cases carried a mutation affecting the component of the splicing machinery. To confirm the observation, we examined 9 spliceosome genes for mutations in a large set of myeloid neoplasms (N=582) using a high-throughput mutation screen of pooled DNA followed by confirmation/identification of candidate mutations. In total, 219 mutations were identified in 209 out of the 582 specimens of myeloid neoplasms. Mutations of the splicing machinery were highly specific to diseases showing myelodysplastic features, including 19 of 23 (83%) cases with RARS, 43 of 50 (86%) RCMD-RS, 68 of 155 (44%) other MDS, 48 of 88 (55%) CMML, and 16 of 62 (26%) secondary AML with MDS features with a string preference of SF3B1 mutations to RARS and RCMD-RS and of SRSF2 to CMML, while they were rare in cases with de novo AML (N=151) and MPD (N=53). The mutations among 4 genes, U2AF35 (N = 37), SRSF2 (N = 56), SF3B1 (N = 79) and ZRSR2 (N = 23), explained most of the mutations with a much lower mutational rate for SF3A1 (N = 8), PRPF40B (N = 7), U2AF65 (N = 4) and SF1 (N = 5). Interestingly, mutations in the former three genes showed clear hot spots, indicating a gain-of-function nature of these mutations. On the other hand, two thirds of the ZRSR2 mutations are nonsense or frameshift changes causing premature truncation of the protein. Significantly, these mutations occurred in an almost completely mutually exclusive manner among mutated cases, and commonly affected those components of the splicing complex that are engaged in the 3' splice site recognition during RNA splicing, strongly indicating production of unspliced or aberrantly spliced RNA species are incriminated for the pathogenesis of MDS. In fact, when transduced into HeLa cells, the recurrent S34F U2AF35 mutant induced the increase in the production of unspliced RNA species and elicited the activation of the nonsense mediated decay pathway. Functionally, the U2AF35 mutants seemed to cause deregulated stem cell functions, because CD34(\u2212) KSL cells transduced with various U2AF35 mutants invariably showed reduced chimerism in competitive reconstitution assay. In accordance with this, the S34F U2AF35 mutant lead to suppression of cell growth in a variety of cell types, including HeLa cells, in which expression of the mutant induced a G2/M cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. In conclusion, whole-exome sequencing unexpectedly revealed the high frequency of the splicing pathway mutations in MDS and related myeloid neoplasms, providing the first evidence indicating that compromised RNA splicing by gene mutations are responsible for human pathogenesis.
