    "abstract_text": "Abstract 50623 Background: Bone marrow karyotype in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is essential to define the prognosis and to guide treatment decisions, including targeted therapies. Due to the lack of an extensive national MDS registry in Italy, epidemiological data on MDS, including cytogenetics, throughout the territory is unknown. Objective: We evaluated the incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities amongst newly diagnosed MDS patients in in 2 southern Italian regions (Calabria and Puglia). Methods: A pilot project, denominated ANDROMEDA (ANalysis of cytOgenetics alteRatiOn in the MyEloDysplAstic syndromes) was developed in 17 centers to offer a service of conventional cytogenetic analysis for all consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic evaluation for cytopenia and suspected MDS between January 1 and December 31, 2011. The study conformed to the ethical standards set out in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by institutional review boards at each participating center. Patients were required to provide their written informed consent. Clinical characteristics of patients and bone marrow morphology, iron staining and histology were registered. Bone marrow samples were centralized for standard cytogenetic studies and fluorescence in situ hybridization to two dedicated genetics laboratories (one for each region), blind to patients' data. Results: Two hundred and thirty-five patients were evaluated and MDS diagnosis was confirmed in 220 cases (88. 3%), according to WHO criteria. The overall incidence of clonal chromosome abnormalities detected by conventional analysis was 36. 9%. Single abnormalities included +8 (13 cases, 5. 8%), del(5q) (12 cases, 5. 4%), \u2013Y (11 cases, 5. 0%) and del(7)/-7 (4 cases, 1. 8%). Complex karyotypes were detected in 18 (8. 1%) cases. Among all cases only 10 (4. 5%) bone marrow samples were not evaluable for cytogenetic analysis. FISH revealed additional abnormalities not identified by conventional analysis only in 3 (1. 3%) out of 72 cases. Patients were classified in WHO subtypes: 39. 2% refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia (RCUD), 1. 5% refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), 32. 5% refractory cytopenia with multilineage (RCMD), 10. 8% refractory anemia with excess of blast-1 (RAEB-1), 9. 3% refractory anemia with excess of blast-2 (RAEB-2), 4. 1% MDS with deletion 5q (MDS 5q-) and 2. 6% MDS unclassifiable (MDS-U). Conclusions: These preliminary results demonstrate that the incidence of abnormal karyotype patterns and WHO subgroups in MDS patients in Southern Italy is comparable with that described in other geographical areas. It is confirmed that conventional cytogenetic analysis is a standard in the diagnostic workup of MDS of patients with a suspected myeloid malignancy in order to identify primary abnormalities and prognostic models.
