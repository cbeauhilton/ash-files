In this study, we evaluated the precision and agreement of both analyzers in normal and pathological samples and correlation of IPF or rPLT with clinical situations. Methods: Anonymized blood samples of cancer patients after chemotherapy, patients with PLT destruction (immune thrombocytopenia, ITP, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, HIT), and normal controls were analyzed with double measurements with both, the Abbott CD-Sapphire and Sysmex XE-5000. Furthermore, longitudinal evaluations after chemotherapy were performed and effects of PLT transfusions were analyzed. Precision and agreement were assessed with Bland-Altman analyses and Pearson correlation. Results: In a first set of experiments, a total of 220 blood samples were analyzed. We studied patients after chemotherapy with beginning thrombocytopenia (30 samples, median PLT count 23/nl) or recovering PLT counts (64 samples, PLT 48/nl), patients with PLT destruction (16 samples, PLT 84/nl) and normal controls (110 samples, PLT 249/nl). Both analyzers demonstrated acceptable overall precision (reproducibility) with lower precision in thrombocytopenia and a non-significant trend towards a better precision with XE-5000. Inter-instrument comparison showed a moderate correlation (Pearson r 2 =0.38) and a systematic bias of 1.04 towards higher IPF-values with the XE-5000 in the Bland-Altman analysis. Regarding different patient groups, the reference range (percentile 5 \u2013 95) of normal controls was much narrower with the CD-Sapphire, leading to a clear separation of patients with recovering platelet counts after chemotherapy and IPT/HIT, both with increased rPLT as expected (figure). The same trend was visible for the XE-5000, however, with a much broader overlap to the normal range. In longitudinal studies, increased IPF or rPLT were frequently observed already during early thrombocytopenia with a decrease following platelet transfusions. Conclusion: Correlation between both analyzers for measurement of IPF and rPLT, respectively, was moderate. Precision of measurements was low in thrombocytopenic samples. Samples with abnormally increased IPF/rPLT could be indentified with both analyzers, however, separation from normal was better with the CD-Sapphire. Prediction of PLT recovery after intensive chemotherapy by the measurement of IPF/rPLT is questionable. Figure.
