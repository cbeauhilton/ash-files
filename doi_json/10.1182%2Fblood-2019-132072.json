    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Cancer patients appear to have a higher risk of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) related complications than non-cancer patients; yet data on the performance of conventional diagnostic tools for HIT in cancer is limited. Our aim was to determine among cancer patients with a 4T score \u2265 4, the performance of the conventional cut-off for HIT antibody testing (IgG anti PF4) to discriminate between serotonin release assay (SRA) positive and negative cases. Methods: Retrospective and prospective analysis of cases (2002-2019) was performed of the electronic medical records of adult cancer patients at MD Anderson Cancer Center with suspected HIT. Cases were included in the analysis if the 4T score was \u2265 4 and investigated with IgG anti-PF4 optical density (HIT OD) and SRA. Logistic regression model and the receiver operating characteristic curves were conducted to identify the sensitivity and specificity of different cut-off points for the HIT OD to discriminate HIT cases based on the SRA status. Results: Among 50 cases, 18 were SRA positive. Median HIT OD was 1.03. At a cut-off point of 0.4, the HIT OD performed with a sensitivity of 0.89 and a specificity of 0.50 to discriminate the cases of SRA positive HIT. When the cut-off HIT OD was 1.0, the sensitivity was 0.78 with a specificity of 0.66. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that in cancer patients the performance of IgG anti-PF4 is similar to that of non-cancer patients for the identification of HIT cases.
