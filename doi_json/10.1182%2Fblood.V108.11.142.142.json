    "abstract_text": "Zebrafish are a powerful vertebrate model system for the study of human disease as they share many molecular pathways with mammals. Of note, nearly all of the mammalian coagulation factors are also highly conserved in fish. As part of a whole genome ENU mutagenesis screen, we identified a mutant zebrafish which displayed intraventricular hemorrhage between 2\u20133 days post fertilization (dpf), which we named redhead . Using an F2 intercross strategy, we mapped this recessive mutant to a 100 kilobase interval on chromosome 2 and identified a splice site mutation in the gene for an ortholog of the p21-activated kinase Pak2. This IVS9 T+2A mutation renders greater than 90% of transcripts nonfunctional, resulting in a hypomorphic allele. Surveying zebrafish expressed sequence tag databases, we identified two Pak2 orthologs in zebrafish, designated Pak2a and Pak2b, with the redhead mutation in pak2a . Central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage in redhead embryos was rescued by injection of wild type pak2a mRNA. Morpholino knockdown of pak2a in wild type fish phenocopies the redhead mutant, but with an increase in penetrance and severity, including hydrocephalus and pericardial edema secondary to severe hemorrhage. Injection of either pak2a or pak2b mRNA was able to rescue this phenotype. In addition, pak2b knockdown worsened the bleeding phenotype in redhead embryos, with no effect on wild type fish. These results suggest a partial overlap in function between Pak2a and Pak2b. Confocal microscopy was performed at 2.5 dpf in pak2a knockdown embryos transgenic for Gata1-dsRED and Flk1-eGFP, distinctively labeling erythrocytes and endothelial cells, respectively. The sites and magnitude of hemorrhage were variable between individual embryos, but there were no obvious abnormalities in vessel patterning. In summary, we have identified a critical role for Pak2 in maintaining CNS vessel integrity in zebrafish, without apparent effects on other vascular beds. Further analysis of this signaling pathway in the vessel wall may provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying vascular heterogeneity in mammals, and the tissue specific function of Pak2 in the CNS vasculature."
