    "abstract_text": "Inflammatory responses are complex and comprise multiple mediators including cytokines such as TNF-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and IL-1beta. These cytokines are synthesized and secreted in response to signaling by plasma membrane receptors of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. A central downstream element of TLR-dependent signaling is the transcription factor NF-kappaB (NF-\u03baB), which plays a pivotal role in controlling the proper sequence of events during an inflammatory response. In unstimulated cells, NF-\u03baB is bound to inhibitory IkappaB (I\u03baB) proteins and remains sequestered in the cytoplasm. Stimulation of TLRs triggers a signaling cascade that leads to phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of I\u03baB, resulting in the translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional activator of target genes. To keep the innate immune system under control, the TLR signaling cascade is under a tight control of many positive and negative regulators. We have previously shown that the transcription factor Growth Factor Independence 1 (Gfi1) represents a novel factor limiting the inflammatory immune response including TNF-\u03b1. Gfi1-deficient (Gfi1 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice show a very strong systemic response to the TLR4 ligand and endotoxin LPS and die rapidly within 36 h with symptoms of septic shock. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of this exaggerated TNF-\u03b1 production in the absence of Gfi1. It is known that endotoxin stimulation results in the activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB through TLR4, leading to TNF-\u03b1 production. This activation also resulted in rapid and de novo expression of Gfi1 in the nucleus in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The expression of Gfi1 was not due to feedback regulation from secreted TNF, since TNF-deficient macrophages were also able to upregulate Gfi1 mRNA following LPS stimulation. As expected, LPS stimulation of Gfi1 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages resulted in significantly higher levels of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA, and secreted TNF-\u03b1 cytokine. Strikingly and in contrast to most known negative regulators of TLRs, Gfi1 did not affect the activity or the expression levels of the cytoplasmic components of TLR signaling pathway. Additionally, NF-\u03baB phosphorylation and nuclear translocation post- LPS treatment were intact in both Gfi1 \u2212/\u2212 and Gfi1 +/+ macrophages. Immunoprecipitation analysis from cells endogenously expressing Gfi1 and NF-\u03baB or over-expressing these two proteins post transfection, clearly revealed a direct interaction between Gfi1 and the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB. Immunofluorescence staining of macrophages post-LPS treatment confirmed direct interaction of these two proteins in the nucleus at the endogenous level. Gfi1 represses transcription by binding to DNA recognition sequences in target gene promoters. Thus, aiming to investigate the effect of Gfi1 expression on NF-\u03baB nuclear signaling, we found that LPS treatment enhances NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity in Gfi1 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages as compared to Gfi1 +/+ cells. Furthermore, over expression of Gfi1 protein resulted in negative regulation of NF-\u03baB mediated gene activation in a dose-dependent manner. Chromatin immune precipitation with anti-p65 antibodies from LPS stimulated Gfi1 +/+ and Gfi1 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages revealed enhanced NF-\u03baB promoter occupancy at the TNF gene in Gfi1 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages as compared to Gfi1 +/+ cells. In conclusion, our findings reveal a novel function for Gfi1 in the innate immune response by directly antagonizing NF-\u03baB function. This molecular perceptive of TNF-\u03b1 regulation during inflammation may provide an attractive strategy for therapeutic intervention in chronic inflammatory diseases and certain cancers."
