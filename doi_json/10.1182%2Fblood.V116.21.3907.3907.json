    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3907 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy. Although the vast majority of patients initially respond to up-front chemotherapy, relapses occur in approximately 20% of cases and have a poor prognosis. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are required to treat minimal residual disease and improve long-term survival. B cell precursor (BCP)-ALL cells express low levels of costimulatory and antigen-presenting molecules and therefore are poorly recognized by the immune system. Previous reports show that CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG) can induce immunogenicity of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas including B-CLL, and that CpG may decrease BCP-ALL tumor burden in a murine xenograft model. In the present study we investigated the effect of various combinations of known potent B cell stimulators including CpG, Interleukin (IL)-2 family cytokines and CD40 ligand (CD40L) on the immunogenicity of both primary BCP-ALL cells and a series of established BCP-ALL cell lines. Using combinations of CpG, IL-4 and CD40L we were able to enhance expression of CD40, CD54, CD86 and MHC class II on BCP-ALL cells, resulting in an increased capacity of BCP-ALL cells to induce proliferative T cell responses and to generate cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). Of note, these CTLs exhibited significantly enhanced anti-leukemic cytotoxicity not only towards treated but also towards untreated BCP-ALL cells, with similar effects found in both allogeneic and syngeneic settings. The strongest effects were observed after exposure of BCP-ALL cells to a combination of CpG, IL-4 and CD40L, whereas untreated control BCP-ALL cells induced minimal T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity only. Importantly, CpG in combination with IL-4 and CD40L was significantly more effective than CpG alone. Our results demonstrate that combined treatment with CpG, IL-2 family cytokines and CD40L is more efficient than CpG alone in inducing an immunogenic phenotype in BCP-ALL cells. Further studies using a humanized leukemia mouse model may open novel therapeutic approaches in the management of BCP-ALL, for example by using adoptive T cell transfer after in-vitro stimulation of autologous T cells with activated BCP-ALL cells.
