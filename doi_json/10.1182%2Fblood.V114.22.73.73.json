    "abstract_text": "Abstract 73 In different culture models, conflicting results have been obtained with respect to the role of the ERK/MAPK pathway and the ERK kinases on erythropoiesis. There is no in vivo experimental data on the role of these kinases in adult erythropoeisis. The existence of two ERK isoforms (ERK1 and ERK2) suggests that they could play specific role, based on their expression, their activation level and/or the ratio between both of them. The ERK1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were used to study this hypothesis. Increased number of circulating erythrocytes, increased hemoglobin level and hematocrit were found in these mice. The deletion of ERK1 leads to an uncontrolled splenic erythropoiesis while the bone marrow erythropoiesis remains normal. The ERK1 \u2212/\u2212 mice display splenomegaly characterized by a marked expansion of the red pulp and an increased number in basophilic (Ery.A) and late basophilic (Ery.B) erythroblasts. This impaired erythropoiesis in ERK1 \u2212/\u2212 mice is cell autonomous as shown by bone marrow transplantation experiments. This splenic erythropoiesis is not due to an overexpression or overactivation of the ERK2 isoform in erythroblasts. It has been shown that Fas-mediated apoptosis of erythroblasts would limit the basal erythropoietic rate. In ERK1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, Ery.A expansion is associated with a decrease in cell surface expression of both Fas and FasL as compared with wild-type mice. This fall in Fas/FasL expression is correlated with a decrease in Annexin V binding on splenic Ery.A and Ery.B. In addition, cell cycle analysis revealed an increased S-phase in ERK1 \u2212/\u2212 Ery.A cells compared with wild-type Ery.A. In conclusion, these data demonstrate for the first time the in vivo involvement of the ERK/MAPK pathway in adult splenic erythropoiesis and underlies the specific role of ERK1 in this function. By regulating the cell surface expression of Fas and FasL on splenic erythroblasts, ERK1 acts as a sensor of the basal erythropoietic rate.
