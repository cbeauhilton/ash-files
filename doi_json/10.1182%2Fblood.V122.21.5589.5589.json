    "abstract_text": "Background Clinical diagnosis of IFI is difficult ,due to lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic tools. An assessment of trends concerning the prevalence of IFI is a challenge and postmortem data may be useful to monitor the local epidemiology ,the frequency and the disease patterns. Aim The aim of this retrospective analysis is to determinate the local epidemiology and the prevalence at autopsy of IFI, occurring in hematological malignancies at a single center\u00a0 over a eleven years period. Methods We have retrospectively reviewed 161 patients \u2013 median age\u00a0 62,5 yrs, range 22 -83 - with hematological malignancies, who underwent autopsy between 2002 -2012. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were 77, Acute Lymphoid\u00a0 Leukemia (ALL) 11,\u00a0 Lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) 56 and other disorders 17. Acute leukemia pts received systemic antifungal\u00a0 prophilaxis, whereas the others not absorbable prophilaxis. None patients received transplant procedures. An experienced pathologist evaluated the organ involvement and the IFI pathologic pattern. Fisher\u2019s Exact test was used to recognize the IFI prevalence, the main occurring pathogens and the involved site; a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The analysis of 161 consecutive autopsies identified 40\u00a0 pts.(25%)resulting to have IFI; of these, 22 were AML (55%) ,6 ALL (15%),11LPD (28%) and 1 other. Aspergillus\u00a0 spp. infection was detected in 20 cases (50%), Mucor spp in 8 (20%) and Candida spp. in 12 (30%). Moulds\u00a0 were prevalent in acute leukemia pts. and Aspergillus spp. is the leading pathogen with respect to Candida and Mucor spp. (p 0,0396),with a statistically significant prevalence in ALL (p 0,0186).The site more involved resulted lung (p 0.0002). Whereas the standardized EORTC/MSG criteria applied in vivo were conclusive for\u00a0 IFI in 6\u00a0 pts ( 15%) only, the postmortem findings revealed fungal infections in further 34\u00a0 pts (85%). Conclusion This analysis confirms that the IFI diagnosis is still an unresolved issue in hematological malignancies. Acute leukemias remain the subset with the higher prevalence of mould infections. As in other largest studies, in our experience Aspergillus spp and lung proved to be the most recurrent pathogen and site of involvement. At now, the diagnostic methods are not still completely able to identify the underlying IFI, thus\u00a0 the autopsy rate should be increased to achieve a better knowledge of epidemiology and to critically review previous misdiagnosis.
