    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is one of the best ways to cure acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, patients with AML undergoing allo-HSCT are at risk of relapse, the mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated the significant decrease of nature killer (NK) cells, and the declined proportion of multi-functional effector NK cells in bone marrow from patients who had a relapse in 3 months after allo-HSCT. Furthermore, we verified the levels of activated Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), not the total TGF-\u03b21, increased in bone marrow of these patients. This high level activated TGF-\u03b21 was correlated with reduced cytotoxicity of NK cell, and contributed to immune escape of tumor cells. Moreover, the expression of glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP), which is critical to TGF-\u03b21 activation, high expressed in CD4 + T cells of patients who had a relapse. These data reveal a mechanism of immune escape and proposes approaches for therapeutic administration of NK cells in order to reverse suppression of activated TGF-\u03b21 during early allo-HSCT.
