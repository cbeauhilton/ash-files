    "abstract_text": "Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and A proper conditioning regimen is vital to stop the development of aGVHD. To provide a platform for the study of aGVHD and evaluate the impact of different conditioning regimens, we established a murine aGVHD model that simulates the clinical situation and can be conditioned with Busulfan-Cyclophosphamide (BU-Cy) and Fludarabine-BU (Flu-BU). In our study, BALB/c mice were conditioned with BU-Cy or Flu-BU and transplanted with 2\u00d710 7 bone marrow cells and 2\u00d710 7 splenocytes from either allogeneic (C57BL/6) or syngeneic (BALB/c) donors. The allogeneic recipients conditioned with BU-Cy had shorter survival (P<0.05) and more severe hepatic and intestinal clinical manifestations and pathological changes associated with increased INF-\u03b3 expression and diminished IL-4 expression in serum compared to allogeneic recipients conditioned with Flu-BU. Meanwhile increased donor-derived T-cell infiltration and impaired bone marrow B-cell development could be seen in the aGVHD mice conditioned with Flu-BU. Our study showed that the conditioning regimen with BU-Cy resulted in more severe peripheral aGVHD, while the Flu-BU regimen was associated with aGVHD with wide bone marrow involvement.
