    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous, aggressive hematological malignancy with dismal prognosis where limited targeted therapies are currently available. Poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) inhibition has emerged as an important therapeutic arsenal to target homologous recombination-deficient tumors. However, molecular understanding of PARP blockade in the context of epigenetic derangements and transcriptional plasticity in human elderly AML pathogenesis remains unexplored. KDM6 proteins are H3K27 demethylases that critically regulate chromatin architecture in multi-cellularity and tumorigenesis (Tran, Mol Cell Biol 2020). KDM6A escapes X-chr inactivation, and Utx -/- female mice spontaneously develop aging associated myeloid leukemia (Gozdecka, Nat Genet 2018; Sera, Blood 2021). In addition, KDM6A  loss of function mutation is implicated in AML relapse (Stief, Leukemia 2020). In contrast, KDM6B primarily exerts an oncogenic function in heme-malignancies. Together, KDM6A and KDM6B play cell type-specific function in leukemia, and KDM6 proteins and associated signaling emerge as important focal point for developing molecular targeted therapy. We identify that KDM6 demethylase activity critically regulates DNA damage repair (DDR) gene expression program in AML. Transcriptome analysis indicated a significant downregulation of expression of DDR genesets in both KDM6A deficient human AML and Utx -/- pre-leukemic cells. Lentiviral shRNA screening performed in response to low-dose \u03b3-irradiation in AML stem cells, revealed a radioprotective function of KDM6A. Expression of KDM6s is regulated by genotoxic stress in a time-dependent manner, and deficiency of JmjC catalytic function impaired DDR transcriptional activation and compromised repair potential. Mechanistically, quantitative ChIP experiments also revealed co-operation between KDM6A and SWI/SNF facilitating dynamic chromatin remodeling at TSS/promoter to induce DDR gene expression. To interrogate changes in chromatin accessibility we performed ATAC-seq analysis in KDM6 deficient AML. Motif enrichment highlighted that while KDM6A depletion led to reduced chromatin access to 140 transcription factors (TFs), only 56 TF binding sites showed increased accessibility. Overall, changes in chromatin accessibility, associated with a reduced binding of DDR regulatory TFs in KDM6 deficient AML, account for a compromised DDR function. In agreement with these findings an array of KDM6 deficient AML cells were more sensitive to PARP inhibition, and pre-clinical mice models xenotransplanted with KDM6A loss of function AML line showed an increased susceptibility to PARP blockade in vivo . FLT3-ITD positive AML with a lower KDM6A expression was more sensitive to olaparib. In addition, olaparib administration significantly reduced bone marrow engraftment of patient-derived xenografts of KDM6A -mutant primary AML. Interestingly, KDM6A expression is upregulated in venetoclax-resistant monocytic-AML compared to venet-sensitive primitive-AML. Using venet responsive isogenic lines we demonstrated that attenuation of KDM6 function increased mitochondrial activity, intracellular ROS levels, de-repressed BCL2 expression, and sensitized AML cells to venetoclax. Additionally, KDM6 loss resulted in transcriptional repression of BCL2A1, commonly associated with venet resistance (Zhang, Nat Cancer 2020). Corroborating these results, dual targeting of PARP with BCL2 was superior to PARP or BCL2 inhibitor monotherapy in inducing primary AML apoptosis, and KDM6A loss further enhanced this synergism. In sum, our study illustrates a molecular mechanistic rationale in support for a novel combination targeted therapy for AML, and posit KDM6A as a molecular determinant for therapeutic efficacy. Intriguingly, KDM6A functions as a gatekeeper of BCL2 and BCL2A1 expression. Similar to TET2 although bi-allelic Utx loss causes evolution to myeloid neoplasms, minimal KDM6 activity is important for survival of human AML cells. KDM6s have been implicated in solid tumors, and both PARP and BCL2 inhibitors are being tested in cancer patients, underscoring a wider scope of application. To conclude, KDM6A unfolds to be a central regulator for susceptibility of AML to both PARP and BCL2 inhibition, expanding the possibility to characterize effective combination targeted therapy for AML in clinical settings.
