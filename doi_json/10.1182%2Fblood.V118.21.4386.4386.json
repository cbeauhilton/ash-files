    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4386 Seizures are rare during infusion of autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). We retrospectively analyzed 159 adult patients (pts.) collected consecutively between January 2006 and July 2009. Pts. were collected on either COBE Spectra (COBE) (n=85) or Fresenius AS 104 (Fresenius) (n=74) cell separators and mobilized with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone (n=47), G-CSF and Plerixafor (n=26), or G-CSF and chemotherapy (n=66). Pts. characteristics did not differ between the COBE and Fresenius cohorts, but there were differences in PBSC product (Table). Pts. collected with COBE had higher white blood cell (WBC) and total nucleated count (TNC) but lower mononuclear cell (MNC) percentage and cell viability than pts. collected with the Fresenius. Absolute CD34+ cells in the PBSC product, CD34+ cells / kg and total CD34+ cells / kg infused at transplant were not significantly different. CD34+ yields (calculated as the ratio of CD34+ cells /\u03bcl of the PBSC product to the patient's peripheral blood CD34+ cells / \u03bcl taken on the day of collection) were significantly higher on the COBE than Fresenius. No serious adverse events occurred during PBSC infusion except 3 of 159 pts. developed seizures during infusion of PBSC; all collected on the COBE and all three had product WBC > 590 \u00d7 10 3 / \u03bcl (compared to a median of 163.3 \u00d7 10 3 / \u03bcl for all other products)( Figure ). Evaluation of pts. did not identify abnormalities in imaging studies, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electrolytes, or past history which might explain etiology of seizures. No significant difference in WBC or platelet engraftment was observed in pts. collected with COBE or Fresenius. We then prospectively correlated WBC counts midway and at the end of PBSC collections. Fourteen pts. had 15 apheresis using the Fresenius. Mid- and post-WBC concentrations were 64 +/\u2212 23 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcl and 69 +/\u2212 20 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcl, respectively. Fifty-one pts. had 66 apheresis using COBE, with WBC counts obtained midway and at the end of collection of 287 +/\u2212 150 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcl and 273 +/\u2212 144 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcl, respectively. Mid-WBC accurately correlated with WBC at the end of the collection in both the COBE and Fresenius cohorts (r 2 = 0.940 and r 2 = 0.904, respectively). Using this information, we prospectively evaluated 65 pts. who underwent 80 PBSC collections in anticipation of an autologous (n=44) or allogeneic (n=7) stem cell transplant between June 2009 and January 2010. Collections for these pts. were performed using the COBE (n=66) or the Fresenius (n=15). Mid-WBC were obtained and products with mid-collection WBC concentration > 450 \u00d7 10 3 /uL (n=29) had additional autologous plasma collected at the time of collection for final product dilution to < 450 \u00d7 10 3 /uL prior to cryopreservation. Pts weight, volume of PBSC product and CD34+ cells/kg infused did not differ between the pts who received diluted PBSC product and those who did not. There were also no differences in either ANC (12 \u00b1 1.3 days vs. 11.5 \u00b1 1.3 days, dilution vs. non-dilution, p = 0.760) or in platelet engraftment (18 \u00b1 3.7 days vs. 16 \u00b1 2.7 days, dilution vs. non-dilution, p = 0.561). No serious adverse infusion effects were observed in either group. In conclusion, high number of WBC in COBE collections is a possible cause of PBSC infusion related seizures. No seizures were observed after dilution of PBSC with high WBC concentration. TIENT AND PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS  . COBE (\u00b1SD) . Fresenius (\u00b1SD) .
