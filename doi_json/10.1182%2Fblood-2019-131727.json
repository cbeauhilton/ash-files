    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients with the X-linked bleeding disorder hemophilia A have impaired blood clotting due to deficient or absent factor VIII (FVIII) coagulant activity. Bleeding can be managed by infusions of any of several plasma-derived (pd) or recombinant (r) therapeutic FVIII proteins (tFVIIIs). The efficacy of tFVIIIs can be eliminated, however, if neutralizing anti-tFVIII-antibodies called \"inhibitors\" develop. Since the development of inhibitors is T-helper-cell dependent, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-class-II (HLAcII) molecules comprise an important early determinant. Accumulating evidence suggests that the presence of the FVIII chaperon protein, von Willebrand factor (VWF), in either pdFVIII or rFVIII concentrates, decreases the immunogenicity of these tFVIIIs by reducing their uptake by antigen presenting cells, especially dendritic cells (DCs). Objectives: Use a native (i.e., non-engineered) full-length (FL) tFVIII without ((\u2212)) or with ((+)) pdVWF in DC-protein processing and presentation assays (PPPAs) followed by mass-spectrometric and peptide-proteomic analyses to identify and quantify the DP-, DQ-, and DR-bound/tFVIII-derived-peptides in individual HLAcII repertoires. Compare the number of peptides in the subset from any of the five globular domains (A1, A2, A3, C1 and C2) or three acidic-residue-rich connecting segments (a1, a2 and a3), which we collectively refer to as the non-B-domain (NBD) portion of a tFVIII, with the number of peptides from its non-globular \"outrigger like\" B-domain (BD) that contains ~80% of the N-linked glycans of a FL-FVIII molecule despite containing only 908 amino acid residues, i.e. slightly less than 40% of its 2,332 total residues. Methods: DC-PPPAs were performed using monocyte-derived (Mo)DCs obtained from 12 healthy blood donors. The tFVIII tested was a FL-rFVIII (Advate\u00ae) used (\u2212) or (+) pdVWF (i.e., FL-rFVIII \u2212 pdVWF and FL-rFVIII + pdVWF) and the resulting data consists of counts of tFVIII-derived peptides presented on and extracted from HLAcII molecules. Difference of proportion tests were used to compare the effect of pdVWF as well as the NBD- and BD-regions of the FL tFVIII on the peptide counts. Results : FL-rFVIII \u2212 pdVWF yielded significantly more peptides (p<0.05) than FL-rFVIII + pdVWF from the NBD portions but not the BD. Interestingly, for the FL-rFVIII \u2212 pdVWF preparation, the NBD portions yielded significantly more peptides (p<0.05) than the BD, but this pattern was reversed for the FL-rFVIII + pdVWF preparation in that the NBD portions yielded significantly less peptides (p<0.05) than the BD. Conclusions: The Outrigger Hypothesis posits that in the presence of VWF the heavily glycosylated BD acts as an \"outrigger\" and renders this portion of a FL tFVIII relatively more likely to be internalized, proteolytically processed and HLAcII-presented. However, in the absence of VWF, the N-linked glycans individually act to protect the amide bonds in the underlying peptide bond backbone of a tFVIII from proteolytic processing, as posited by the GUMB Hypothesis. Our results support both hypotheses as important determinants in the pathogenesis of inhibitor development.
