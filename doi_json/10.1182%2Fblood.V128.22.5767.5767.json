    "abstract_text": "Introduction: In the HSCT, msucle mass and visceral fat are associated to comorbidities, mortality, length of stay, duration of use of immunosupressive drugs, the development of graft-versus host disease(GVHD) and survival. A recent study in patients undergone allogenic HSCT showed an inverse association between areas of visceral and peripherical fat with disease-free interval. In allogenic HSCT, decreased muscle mass is associated to higher prevalence of chronic GVHD and low performance. Objectives: To evaluate the muscle thickness(MT), visceral fat(VF) and muscle stregth(MS), correlating them with engraftment(EN). Methods: We studied 14 HSCT patients, adults(>=18 years), from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil. In the first day of hospitalization, before HSCT, we evaluated MT of right femoral quadriceps, 6 cm from the top edge of the patela; VF was measured in the abdominal area, and was characterized by the distance between the linea alba and the anterior wall of aorta artery. This measuments were evaluated by ultrasound in B-mode. In addition, all patients had their dominant upper limb strength evaluated by hand grip. Results: Most patients were women (57%) and the mean age was 50 years(+-16 years). We had haploidentical(57%), autologus(36%) and allogenic(7%). Most of our patients were overweight, mean 27 kg/m2(+-4 kg/m2). The EN average time was 16 days (+-6days). MT mean was 1,5 cm(+-0,3cm), VF 5,3 cm(+-1,4 cm) and MS 31 kgf(+-7,0 kgf). There was a negative and significant correlation between EN and MT(rs-0,8,p<0,05). We didn`t find any correlation with VF, MS and EN. Conclusion: The MT evaluated by ultrasound showed a strong correlation with EN. The ultrasound is pratical, low cost, no risk inHSCT, it could be more used for these patients.
