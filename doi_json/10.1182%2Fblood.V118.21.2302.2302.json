    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2302 Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a polypathologic syndrome which involves blood, endothelial and target organ dysfunction resulting in the generation of various mediators of vascular dysfunction, hemostatic aberrations and hemodynamic disturbances. In addition, various disorders of target organs such as kidney, liver, heart and brain are observed. Uncontrolled protease generation results in the formation of various mediators of inflammation such as neuron specific enolase (NSE), neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGal) and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF R1). Endothelial damage results in the generation of thrombomodulin (TM) and endogenous coagulation/fibrinolysis results in D- Dimer formation. In order to study the circulating levels of these mediators, a Biochip array method (Randox, Oceanside, CA) was utilized with samples obtained from clinically diagnosed DIC (n=100) and normal individuals (n=10). The results are summarized in the following table. Circulating levels of these mediators were markedly increased in DIC patients in comparison to normals. The most striking increase was noted in NGal (4\u20136 fold) and TNF R1 (10 fold). Other mediators were also increased in the DIC group, however the data was broadly scattered. These results indicate that beside the aberration in the hemostatic system NGal and TNF R1 along with other inflammatory mediators may play a major role in the pathophysiology of DIC.  Marker .
