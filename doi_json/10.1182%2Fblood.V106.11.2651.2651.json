    "abstract_text": "It has been documented that fibrinogen (Fg) is required for platelet aggregation. However, we recently found that platelet rich thrombi still formed in mice lacking either Fg (Fg\u2212/\u2212) or both Fg and vWF (Fg/vWF\u2212/\u2212) ( Ni et al, JCI  106 : 385 \u2013392, 2000 ). To explore the potential mechanisms of Fg/vWF-independent platelet aggregation, we studied platelet aggregation in vitro in platelet rich plasma (PRP). We found no platelet aggregation in Fg\u2212/\u2212 or Fg/vWF\u2212/\u2212 PRP induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in the presence of anticoagulant reagents including divalent cation chelators (ACD, sodium citrate, and EDTA), and thrombin inhibitors (heparin, hirudin, PPACK). Since no fibrin formation occurs in Fg/vWF\u2212/\u2212 plasma, we then induced Fg/vWF\u2212/\u2212 platelet aggregation in non-anticoagulated platelet poor plasma (PPP). Surprisingly, robust aggregation occurred after ADP treatment. We further demonstrated that directly triggering the thrombin receptor PAR4 with thrombin receptor activation peptide (TRAP, AYPGKF-NH 2 ) induced platelet aggregation in thrombin-inhibitor treated Fg/vWF\u2212/\u2212 PRP and gel-filtered Fg/vWF-platelets in 1mM Ca2+ PIPES buffer. Thus Fg/vWF-independent aggregation can be induced in vitro and both divalent cations and thrombin are required for this novel platelet aggregation pathway. It is likely that ADP induced thrombin generation in Fg/vWF-/- PRP. Considering platelet aggregation has been observed in type I Glanzmann Thrombasthenic patients lacking \u03b1IIb\u03b23 protein, we hypothesized that Fg/vWF\u2212/\u2212 platelet aggregation may occur in either a \u03b23 integrin-dependent or \u03b23 integrin independent manners. To test this hypothesis, \u03b23 integrin deficient (\u03b23\u2212/\u2212) platelets were added into the same non-anticoagulated Fg/vWF\u2212/\u2212 plasma and no aggregation was observed after ADP treatment. \u03b23\u2212/\u2212 platelets also did not co-aggregate with Fg/vWF\u2212/\u2212 platelets in vitro in aggregation assays, which were analyzed by flow cytometry with an anti-CD61 (anti-\u03b23 integrin) antibody. Furthermore, when fluorescently labeled \u03b23\u2212/\u2212 platelets were injected into Fg/vWF\u2212/\u2212 mice, \u03b23\u2212/\u2212 platelets did not significantly incorporate into Fg/vWF\u2212/\u2212 thrombi under confocal intravital microscopy. The inability of \u03b23\u2212/\u2212 platelets to aggregate is not due to a deficiency in other adhesive receptors, since no reduction of GPIb\u03b1, \u03b21 integrins, and P-selectin was observed on \u03b23\u2212/\u2212 platelets. Thus, although the GPIb complex, P-selectin, and \u03b21 integrins may be involved in platelet aggregation, \u03b23 integrin is essential for this Fg/vWF-independent platelet aggregation pathway. This also indicates that other alternative ligands of \u03b23 integrin from either the plasma or platelet granules are capable of mediating platelet aggregation independent of both Fg and vWF under more physiologically relevant conditions (i.e. non anti-coagulated blood) where divalent cations and thrombin are present.",
