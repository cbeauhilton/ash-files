    "abstract_text": "The interaction between CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor super family, and its ligand CD154 is essential for the development of humoral and cellular immune responses. Selective inhibition or activation of this pathway forms the basis for the development of new therapeutics against immunologically-based diseases and malignancies. CD40 is expressed primarily on dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells. Engagement of CD40-CD154 induces activation and proliferation of B lymphocytes and triggers apoptosis of carcinoma and B lymphoma cells. Agonist CD40 antibodies mimic the signal of CD154-CD40 ligation on the surface of many tumors and mediate a direct cytotoxic effect in the absence of immune accessory molecules. CD40 expression is found on nearly all B cell malignancies. Engagement of CD40 in vivo inhibits B cell lymphoma xenografts in immune compromised mice. Several clinical trials have been reported targeting CD40 in cancer patients using recombinant CD154, mAbs and gene therapy, which were well tolerated and resulted in objective tumor responses. In addition to these therapies, CD54 mimetics have been considered with the objective to augment and potentiate the direct cytotoxic anti-tumor activity and for better accessibility to tumor sites. This approach was developed by us and we hypothesized that the genetic engineering of a fusion protein containing a CD154 peptide mimetic may be advantageous in that it may have a better affinity to CD40 on B cell malignancies and trigger cell death and the partner may be a carrier targeting other surface molecules expressed on the malignant cells. This hypothesis was tested by the development of a gene fusion of Salmonella typhi OmpC protein expressing the CD154 Trp140-Ser149 amino acid strand ( Vega et al., Immunology  2003 ; 110 : 206 \u2013216 ). This OmpC-CD154 p fusion protein binds CD40 and triggers the CD40 expressing B cells. In this study, we demonstrate that OmpC-CD154 p treatment inhibits cell growth and proliferation of the B-NHL cell lines Raji and Ramos. In addition, significant apoptosis was achieved and the extent of apoptosis was a function of the concentration used and time of incubation. The anti-tumor effect was specific as treatment with OmpC alone had no effect. These findings establish the basis of the development of new fusion proteins with dual specificity (targeting the tumor cells directly or targeting the tumor cells and immune cells). The advantages of this approach over conventional CD40-targeted therapies as well as the mechanism of OmpC-CD154 p -induced cell signaling and cell death will be presented."
