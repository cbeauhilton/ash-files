    "abstract_text": "High hyperdiploid (HeH) B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP ALL) is characterized by a very specific nonrandom gain of chromosomes; a feature distinct from other types of aneuploid tumor types that usually display very heterogeneous gains and losses of chromosomes. Gains of chromosomes X, 4, 6, 10, 14, 17, and 18 are seen in more than 75% of cases of HeH childhood ALL, and of chromosome 21 in 100% of cases. In contrast to many aneuploid malignancies, there has been little evidence of chromosomal instability (CIN) in HeH ALL and the mechanisms leading to these chromosomal gains remain unknown. The aim of this project was to determine the level of genomic heterogeneity in HeH ALL. In order to do this, we performed low-pass whole genome sequencing (WGS) of single cells isolated from diagnostic bone marrow samples from HeH ALL patients to investigate cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Single nuclei in G 1 phase from nine diagnostic childhood HeH ALL samples were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and DNA libraries were constructed for low-pass WGS. Copy number analysis for each individual cell was performed in-house using the software programs AneuFinder and Ginkgo. Homolog inheritance of chromosomes gained or lost was determined by screening for heterozygous variants and calculation of the variant allele frequencies (VAF). Sequencing 2,572 single cells showed that the nine HeH ALL patients were all relatively homogenous at the trunk of their evolution tree and that the bulk of chromosomal gains were stable and unchanging. Structural aberrations, visible as partial chromosome copy number changes, were detected at diagnosis in most cases, with a greater number of structural aberrations detected in patients with greater numbers of sub-clones (defined as three or more cells presenting with the same numerical and structural aberrations). Unique numerical chromosomal aberrations detected in two or fewer cells were relatively random and therefore indicative of nondisjunction events in recent cell divisions rather than being part of the clonal evolution of the leukemia. These results indicate very low heterogeneity in HeH ALL and suggests that the genome of these leukemias is relatively stable. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
