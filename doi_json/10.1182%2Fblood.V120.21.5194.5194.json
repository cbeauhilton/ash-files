    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5194 Objective: To investigate the in vivo antithrombotic efficacy of an anti-VWF monoclonal antibody SZ-123, and its potential underlying mechanism. Methods and Results: Cyclic flow reductions (CFRs) were measured in the femoral artery of monkeys before and after intravenous administration of SZ-123. Ex vivo VWF binding to collagen, platelet aggregation, platelet count and template bleeding time were performed as measurements of antithrombotic activity. In addition, plasma VWF, SZ-123 levels, and VWF occupancy were measured by ELISA. Administration of 0. 1, 0. 3, and 0. 6 mg/kg SZ-123 resulted in 45. 3%, 78. 2%, and 100% reduction in CFRs, respectively. When 0. 3 and 0. 6 mg/kg SZ-123 were administrated, 100% of VWF was occupied by the antibody. Moreover, 100% ex vivo inhibition of VWF-collagen binding and 60\u201395% inhibition of platelet aggregation were observed from 15 min to 1h. None of the doses resulted in significant prolongation of bleeding time. In vitro experiment also revealed that SZ-123 not only blocks collagen-VWF A3 interaction but also inhibits indirectly VWF A1 binding to GPIba induced by ristocetin. Conclusions: SZ-123 prevents in vivo arterial thrombus formation under high shear conditions by inhibiting VWF A3\u2013collagen and VWF A1-platelet interactions and does not prolong bleeding time.
