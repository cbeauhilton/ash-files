    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1660 Recently, we have found that HDAC6 is overexpressed in MCL cell lines and in primary human MCL cells. Knocking-down HDAC6 in MCL cells with a shRNA lentiviral system resulted in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. Interestingly, MCL cells lacking HDAC6 displayed a significantly decreased STAT3 phosphorylation and abrogation of IL-10 gene transcriptional activity. ACY1215 is a novel, selective, orally bioavailable HDAC6 inhibitor. Treatment of MCL cell lines with this agent resulted in decreased cell viability and proliferation. In addition, ACY1215 inhibits IL-10 production in a dose dependent manner. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of Tec family of kinases with a very distinct role in B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling. The selective BTK-inhibitor PCI-32765 has shown promising pre-clinical and clinical activity in MCL. In addition to their direct anti-lymphoma effects, disruption of BTK also induces positive immunological changes such as inhibition of the immunosuppressive STAT3/IL-10 signaling pathway 1 . The above observations led us to determine whether the direct antitumor effects and the immunological properties of ACY1215 and PCI-32765 could be potentiated when these agents are used in combination. First, the viability of MCL cells was decreased when they were treated in vitro with either PCI-32765 or ACY1215. However, combination of these two agents resulted in a 3-fold increase in apoptosis induction, pointing to a synergistic effect of BTK and HDAC6 inhibition in MCL. The additional findings that this approach can increase the immunogenicity of MCL cells and anti-MCL immune responses has provided the proper framework for combining the selective HDAC6 inhibitor ACY1215 with BTK inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy in MCL.
