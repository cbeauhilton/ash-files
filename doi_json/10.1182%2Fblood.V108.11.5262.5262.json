    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Patients undergoing ASCT for CML are increasingly likely to have received a NTKI after failing imatinib mesylate. It is unknown whether the use of these NTKIs prior to ASCT increases transplant-related toxicity. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 12 patients with CML (1 in chronic phase, 6 in accelerated phase, and 5 in blastic phase) who received dasatinib (n=2), nilotinib (n=7), or both (n=3) prior to ASCT. Results: Median age was 41 years (range, 18\u201359 years). The median time on treatment was 134 days (range, 30\u2013285 days), and the median time from the end of NTKI therapy to ASCT was 34 days (range, 7\u2013130 days). Preparative regimen was ablative in 8 patients and non-ablative in 4. Stem cell source was a matched related donor in 7 patients, a matched unrelated donor in 3, a haplo-identical donor in 1, and unrelated cord blood in 1. All patients engrafted within 13 days. There was no significant early transplant-related toxicity: gastro-intestinal toxicities of grade 3 were encountered in 2 patients. One patient had secondary graft failure 6 months after the first ASCT that required a second ASCT. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of grade 2 was observed in 7 patients (58%) and chronic GVHD in 6 (50%). Nine patients achieved a molecular response: four complete and five major (Q-PCR< 0.05%). Three patients had disease progression by day 30 post ASCT. Two patients have relapsed after 6 and 18 months. After a median follow-up of 10 months (range, 3\u201322 months), 7 patients are alive in molecular response and 5 patients died, 4 of disease progression and one of extensive chronic GVHD. Conclusion: Previous treatment with NTKI did not increase transplant-related toxicity in this preliminary experience. Further follow-up and larger number of patients will be necessary to confirm these observations.",
