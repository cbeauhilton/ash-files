    "abstract_text": "Between 1995 and 2005, we performed 329 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 286 autoulogous and 43 allogeneic. Long term results of treatment and outcome of ASCT in 100 Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) were analyzed. Median age was 47 years (range18 \u2013 64) and the histology was: Follicular Lymphoma 15%, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 47%, T lymphoma 27% and 11% others. At diagnosis 66% had advanced stage (III/IV), 40% had B symptoms, and 34% had extranodal involvement. Disease status at HSCT was: 5 % primary induction failure, 41% CR1, 20% CR2 +, 7% CRU, 12% relapsed. Number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 47% 2 lines, 20% 3 lines and 3% 4 lines; 27% had received prior induction or consolidation radiotherapy. Condition regimens consisted of BEAC (81%), BEAM (15%), others (4%). Stem cell source: 39% received BM + PBSC and 61% PBSC. Sixty nine are alive with a median survival of 3448 days (9.5 years). Median overall survival was similar in DLBCL (59%) and peripheral T lymphoma (60%). The best overall survival was observed in CR1 (77%) versus 52% in CR2 and 66% in PR1. Primary cause of death was relapsed or progression (24/31). We concluded that high dose therapy and autologous HSCT is an effective therapy for patients with poor risk NHL however relapse continues to be the most common cause of treatment failure. Newer strategies such as monoclonal antibody, require further investigation but early reports appear promising in reducing relapses in autologous HSCT."
