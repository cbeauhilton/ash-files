    "abstract_text": "Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are chronic hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by overproduction of mature myeloid cells. Recently, somatic mutation of calreticulin (CALR) was frequently found in MPN patients who do not have JAK2 mutation. The CALR mutation in MPN patients usually resulted in loss-of-function of CALR, which may induce impairment of physiological phagocytotic pathway, because surface CALR plays a critical role for macrophages in recognition of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) on the targets, mediating pro-phagocytic signals. We hypothesized that the non-functional CALR mutation renders cells resistant to phagocytosis, and impairs the \u201cprogrammed cell removal\u201d of progenitors or mature blood cells, resulting in accumulation of hematopoietic cells in MPNs. In 135 Japanese MPNs patients enrolled in this study, including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF), 34 patients (25.2%) had CALR mutations, and 80 (59.3%) patients had JAK2 V617F mutation, respectively. CALR mutations were heterozygous in all 34 patients (27 patients with ET, 7 with PMF). On the other hand, JAK2 V617F mutations were found in 26 patients with PV, 39 with ET, and 15 with PMF. The expression levels of pro-phagocytotic CALR were normal in these MPN patients. We then performed in vitro phagocytosis assay to test whether the heterozygous CALR mutation affects engulfment of blood cells by macrophages. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), progenitor cell populations such as common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (MEPs) and granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMPs), and mature myeloid cells were isolated and opsonized, and were co-cultured with activated macrophages for 2 hours. After the culture, we enumerate macrophages and engulfed cells to analyze phagocytosis index (number of engulfed cells/number of macrophages) (Kuriyama et al. Blood 2012). However, the phagocytosis index was not changed in any of purified hematopoietic cells, irrespective of the presence of CALR or JAK2 mutation. These results strongly suggest that heterozygous, non-functional CALR mutation, and gain-of-function JAK2 mutations should not affect the engulfment process for hematopoietic cells by macrophages. We then investigated the effect of CALR or JAK2 mutations on differentiation and proliferation of stem or progenitor cells in MPNs. We performed colony-forming cell assay of multipotent cells, such as HSCs and CMPs, and evaluated clonal burden of CALR and JAK2 mutations in colonies derived from these stem and progenitor cells. In vitro culture showed that HSCs and CMPs with CALR and JAK2 mutations gave rise to granulocyte/monocyte (GM) or megakaryocyte/erythroid (MegE)-related colonies, whose frequencies were almost identical to those in wild-type controls, suggesting that these mutations do not affect myelo-erythroid lineage commitment at the multipotent stem or progenitor stages. In contrast, when we cultured GMPs and MEPs, frequencies of colonies with CALR or JAK2 mutations were significantly higher as compared to those in HSCs or CMPs (P<0.05); In patients with CALR mutation, 32.5% of HSC-derived colonies had CALR mutations, whereas in MEPs and GMPs, CALR mutations were found in 51.0% and 70%, respectively. In JAK2 mutated MPNs, 17.2% of HSC-derived colonies had JAK2 mutation, whereas 64.7% of MEP- and 87.9% of GMP-derived colonies had this mutation. These results indicate that clones with CALR or JAK2 mutations could contribute more robustly to maintain MEPs and GMPs, and these committed progenitors with mutations might produce higher amounts of mature myelo-erythroid cells, leading to progression of MPNs. Thus, CALR mutation contributes to progression of MPN, not through inhibition of phagocytic clearance, but presumably through enhanced production of myelo-erythroid lineage cells, as JAK2 mutation does. It is important to investigate the mechanism on which the CALR mutation causes overproduction of myelo-erythroid cells in future study. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
