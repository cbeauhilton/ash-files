    "abstract_text": "Introduction JAK2V617F (JAK2VF) is the most frequent mutation in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and its role has been demonstrated in mouse models. Actually, JAK2VF transgenic (JAK2VF Tg) mice generated by us induce lethal MPN (Shide et al. Leukemia 2008). Recently, mutations of epigenetic regulator such as TET2 are also frequently identified in MPN, and several TET2 knock out or knock down (TET2KD) mouse models are generated. We previously analyzed TET2KD mice (Ayu17-449) (Shide et al. Leukemia 2012). TET2KD fetal liver (FL) or bone marrow (BM) cells showed a growth advantage over Wt BM cells, with increased self-renewal capacity of hematopoietic stem cells; however TET2KD mice didn\u2019t develop MPN, and its role in MPN remained unclear. To explore the role of TET2 deficiency in MPN harboring JAK2VF, we examined the cooperative effect, using these mutant mice. Materials and methods (1) Mice and collection of test cells. JAK2VF Tg mice (C57BL/6, Ly5.2) and TET2KD mice (Ayu17-449, C57BL/6, Ly5.2) were used. We crossed them, and collected JAK2Wt-TET2Wt (Wt-Wt), JAK2Wt-TET2KD (Wt-KD), JAK2VF-TET2Wt (VF-Wt), and JAK2VF-TET2KD (VF-KD) FL cells. (2) Non-competitive repopulation assay (NCRA). FL cells (Ly5.2, 1x106 cells) were transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients (Ly5.1) without competitor cells. Recipients were analyzed by complete blood counts, flow cytometry, colony-forming assay, colony-replating assay, pathology at 20-28 weeks post-transplantation, and overall survival. (3) Competitive repopulation assay (CRA) and serial BM transplantation (sBMT). FL cells (Ly5.2, 1x106 cells) were transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients (Ly5.1) with competitor Wt BM cells (Ly5.1, 5x106 cells), and sBMT was performed by 1x106 BM cells of the recipients at every 12 weeks post-transplantation. Recipients which were not selected as the donors were analyzed. (4) Analyses of adult mutant mice. Mice were bred in BDF1 background and analyzed at 20 or more weeks of age, as well as the recipients in NCRA. (5) Statistical analysis. Results were presented as means\u00b1S.D. Two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test and log-rank test were used. Result In NCRA, both recipients transplanted with VF-Wt cells and VF-KD cells developed MPN with increase in WBC and Plt, decrease in Hb, fibrosis in BM and spleen, and extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) of lung and liver; and the latter developed more severe MPN and died earlier: VF-Wt (n=10) vs. VF-KD (n=10); WBC (x104/\u00b5l), 4.2\u00b11.6 vs. 7.3\u00b13.3 (p<0.05); peripheral blood (PB) myeloid cells (%), 59.6\u00b19.7 vs. 71.9\u00b18.2 (p<0.05); liver weight (g), 1.15\u00b10.22 vs. 1.48\u00b10.22 (p<0.01); spleen weight (g), 0.26\u00b10.11 vs. 0.52\u00b10.19 (p<0.01): VF-Wt (n=36) vs. VF-KD (n=30); mean survival time (weeks), 36 vs. 39 (p<0.05). In colony-forming assay, number of CFU-GM was more increased in VF-KD cells than VF-Wt cells: VF-Wt (n=9) vs. VF-KD (n=9); colonies/2x104 BM cells, 107\u00b137 vs. 157\u00b146 (p<0.05). In colony-replating assay, VF-Wt BM cells lost replating capacity by 3rd to 5th passage; VF-KD BM cells retained replating capacity beyond 5th passage: VF-Wt (n=9) vs. VF-KD (n=6); number of colonies in 4th passage, 5.9\u00b16.8 vs. 896\u00b1613 (p<0.01). In CRA, all recipients transplanted with VF-Wt cells (n=9) or VF-KD cells (n=9) showed \u2265 70% test cell-derived PB chimerism, and developed MPN with fibrosis and EMH at 12 weeks. In 2nd BMT, 4/9 recipients transplanted with VF-Wt cells showed \u2265 35% PB chimerism at 12 weeks. Six recipients were analyzed at 12-16weeks, and no one (0/6) showed pathological findings of MPN. Whereas, 7/9 recipients transplanted with VF-KD cells showed \u2265 35% PB chimerism. Five recipients were analyzed, and 3/5 developed MPN with fibrosis and EMH: VF-Wt (n=6) vs. VF-KD (n=5); liver weight (g), 1.00\u00b10.12 vs. 1.39\u00b10.15 (p<0.002); spleen weight (g), 0.069\u00b10.019 vs. 0.20\u00b10.097 (p<0.05). In analyses of adult mutant mice, both VF-Wt mice and VF-KD mice developed MPN, and disease severities or colony-replating capacities are similar tendencies as those in transplantation model. Conclusion TET2 deficiency increases severity of MPN harboring JAK2VF. TET2 deficiency enhances disease initiating potential of JAK2VF-MPN stem cells. TET2 deficiency is considered to be critical for both onset and progression of MPN harboring JAK2V617F. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
