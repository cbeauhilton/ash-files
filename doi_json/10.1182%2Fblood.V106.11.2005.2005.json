    "abstract_text": "Imatinib is an effective therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a myeloproliferative syndrome characterised by the expression of the recombinant oncoprotein Bcr-Abl. Imatinib inhibits Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity leading to apoptosis of leukemic cells sparing normal hematopoiesis. Several mechanisms of resistance to imatinib have been identified both in vitro and in vivo: Bcr-Abl mutations, an over-expression of the Bcr-Abl kinase itself or other tyrosine kinase bypass. To identify unknown mechanism, we used an imatinib resistant cell line (K562-R) generated from the erythroblastic cell line K562 (K562-S) ( Blood , 2000 ; 93 : 1070 \u20131079 ) for which all described mechanisms of resistance have been previously invalidated. Previous results from a proteomic study identified some chaperon proteins such as heat shock proteins with an increased expression level in K562-R. One of them, the heat shock protein 70, Hsp70, has a 3 fold increase expression level in K562-R cells, results which have been confirmed by western-blot analysis. To characterise the role of Hsp 70 in imatinib resistance, we inhibit Hsp 70 expression by RNA silencing (siRNA) in K562-R cells and over-express it in K562-S cells. Inhibition of Hsp70 protein expression by siRNA decrease Hsp70 expression rapidly over 90% at day 4 which is associated with a significant reduction of viability (66 \u00b1 6%, n = 5, p < 0.03). Over expression of Hsp 70 in K562-S cells induced a significant increase of resistance to imatinib since the addition of imatinib only increases mortality by 27 \u00b1 5 % in comparison to 52 \u00b1 4 % for K562-S cells (n = 4, p < 0.001). Detection of HSF-1 phosphorylation, the major transcription factor involved in Hsp 70 expression, did not show significant differences between K562-S and K562-R cells although over a 3 fold increase is detected in the mRNA level of Hsp 70 in K562-R cells by quantitative PCR. Furthermore, the comparison of Hsp70 expression in mononuclear cells of 7 CML patients before imatinib treatment and at the relapse time shows that Hsp 70 is increased in imatinib resistant patients suggesting it could also play a role in resistance in vivo. Present study confirmed that over expression of Hsp 70 in the cell line K562-R is involved in the mechanism of imatinib resistance in vitro. Moreover, the correlation between the increase of Hsp 70 in CML patient cells and resistance suggests it could be an interesting marker and potentially a therapeutic target.",
