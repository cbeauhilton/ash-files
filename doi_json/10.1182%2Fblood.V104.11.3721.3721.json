    "abstract_text": "R is an anti-CD20 MoAb developed to treat B-cell malignancies. While R has been used to treat various autoimmune disorders including AIHA, a systematic review of reports of R to treat AIHA in adults has not been performed. We describe the clinical features and response to R in patients (pts)18 yrs or > with AIHA from PubMed English language citations and manufacturer (Genentech, Inc.) provided reports from 1998\u20132004. 39 reports (34 case reports, 5 case series) identified 92 pts (M 47, F 44, NS 1) with a mean age of 60.7 yr (range, 18\u201391). 1\u00b0/2\u00b0 Warm ( W ) Ab, Cold ( C ) Ab (\u00b1 associated disease), and mixed ( C/W ) AIHA was observed in 11/33, 46, and 2 pts, respectively. Associated disease included: lymphoproliferative (LPD)-( W : NHL 4, CLL 20; C : NHL 26, CLL 1, other 6; C/W : other 1), rheumatologic-( W :6), infectious-( W :2, C :1 with EBV); and other ( W :3; C :2) disorders. Other baseline pre-R features included: mean Hgb 7.5 g/dl (range, 2.8\u201312); >45 pts with a Hgb < 10 g/dl; DAT (+): all W -AIHA; Cold Ab or agglutinin (+): all C -AIHA; both DAT/ C Ab(+): C/W -AIHA; previously untreated 17%; prior splenectomy >11 patients; transfusion dependent 21%; and a mean of 2.6 (range, 1\u20138) prior immunosuppressive regimens. R was administered as 375 mg/m 2 IV weekly X 4 in 83% and in other schedules (15%) for a mean of 3 doses (range, 2\u20138); cycle no. was not stated in 2% pts. R was administered alone in 52 pts and with IVIG 3, chemotherapy 13, or corticosteroids 27. The criteria for response to R included: CR [stable\u2191 Hgb by 2 or > g/dl or Hgb 12 or > g/dl and (\u2212) W or C Ab or agglutinin, resolution of symptoms of anemia, transfusion independent]; PR (\u2191 Hgb by 2 or > g/dl or Hgb 10 or > g/dl but < 12 g/dl, and 50% \u2193 in C Ab/agglutinin titers, + warm Ab, improvement in symptoms of anemia, transfusion independent); NR (failure to meet CR/PR). 83% were eligible for response determination: R monotherapy -CR 10, PR 22, NR 14; R+other regimen- CR 12, PR 10, NR 8. Pt. response by type of AIHA included: 1\u00b0 W -Ab (CR 3, PR 1, NR 3), 2\u00b0 W -Ab (CR 7, PR 14, NR 7), C -Ab \u00b1 associated disease (CR 11, PR 17, NR 12) and C/W (CR 1). In the total group, the Hgb increased a mean of 3.8 g/dl (range, \u22121.4\u201310.5). Hgb increased in CRs by 5.6 (range, 2.9\u201310.5), in PRs by 4.0 (0.7\u20138.1), and in NRs by 2.1(\u22121.4\u20139.5). The mean time to response/response duration among CR+PRs was 22 days (range, 5\u2013120)/10.5 mo. (range, 1.5\u201342). Response duration was recorded as last f/u if the pt did not relapse. Re-treatment with R was reported in 17 pts after initial best reported response (1 st cycle PR 14, NR 3) with R alone (9) or in combination with CTX + DEX (5), or IFN (3) achieving 12 PRs (R 5, R+C+D 5, R+IFN 2) and 5 NRs (R 4, R+IFN 1). Reported R toxicity (n): infusion-related (7), myalgia (1), pruritis (2) rash (1) Gr.4 WBC (2) hypotension (1) and headache (2). One pt died from a fungal infection 3 mo.after R therapy. In this report, R \u00b1 other agents was effective and well-tolerated producing a 71% response rate with clinically meaningful response durations. LPDs were reported in 63% of pts. Studies of R to prospectively assess treatment and response variables, particularly among pts with with W -Ab AIHA, are warranted.",
