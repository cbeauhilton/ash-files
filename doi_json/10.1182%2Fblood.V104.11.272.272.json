    "abstract_text": "Most patients (pts) with CML in chronic phase treated with imatinib achieve a major cytogenetic (CG) remission, and increasing numbers of pts are achieving molecular responses. To determine the clinical significance of molecular responses in these pts, we analyzed the results of quantitative PCR monitoring among 280 pts with CML in CP who achieved a complete CG remission with imatinib therapy (117 after IFN-\u03b1 failure, 163 previously untreated). Pts have been followed for a median of 31.2 mo (range, 3 to 52 mo). The median BCR-ABL/ABL ratio before the start of therapy was 37.43 (range, 0.004 to 170.53). A major molecular response (i.e., BCR-ABL/ABL ratio 1.0 (p=0.0001). The probability of cytogenetic relapse is particularly high for patients who never achieved a major molecular remission. We conclude that achieving a major molecular response, particularly within the first year of therapy with imatinib, is predictive of a durable cytogenetic remission and should be the goal of therapy with imatinib. Increasing transcript levels after achieving a complete CG response predict for a relapse in patients who did not achieve a major molecular response.",
