    "abstract_text": "Biphosphonates (zoledronate, pamidronate and clodronate) are frequently used for bone disease prevention and treatment in patients with multiple myeloma. Monthly biphosphonate therapy improves quality of life and in some reports survival. However, biphosponates are associated with adverse effects such as renal impairment and osteonecrosis of the jaws. We have recently described 3 myeloma patients who developed oseomyelitis of the jaw during chronic biphosphonate therapy. In a national survey we found 11 patients from 6 centers in Israel with osteomyelitis of the jaws probably due to prolonged therapy with intravenous biphosphonates. Nine were female. Median age at the time of diagnosis of myeloma was 67 years (range 59\u201386). nine patients suffered from IgG myeloma, and 2 had light chain disease. In five patients MGUS was known during 4 to 9 years before development of overt myeloma. All patients had received chemotherapy, and 2 underwent ABMT. Median time from diagnosis of myeloma to diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the jaw was 30 months (range 15\u201348). In six cases osteomyelitis was provoked by dental procedure. In all cases the diagnosis of osteomyelitis was confirmed by bone biopsy and in 7 colonies of Actinomyces Israeli were demonstrated. In one patient Pseudomonas Aeruginosa was also found. All patients had been treated with biphosphonates before diagnosis of osteomyelitis (13 to 48 months): eight with pamidronate, and 3 with zoledronate. The mean total dose of pamidronate was 3190 mg (range 1690\u20134680), and zoledronate- 72mg (range 16\u201396). Therapy for osteomyelitis included prolonged antibacterial treatment, surgical debridment, and hyperbaric oxygenation. Acute, and chronic, osteomyelitis of the jaws secondary to biphosphonate therapy, is frequently encountered among myeloma patients and should be reported separately from another complication of biphosphonates, osteonecrosis of the jaws.",
