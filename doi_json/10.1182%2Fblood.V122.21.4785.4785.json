    "abstract_text": "Introduction Von Willebrand disease is the most common bleeding disorder with a prevalence of 1-2% of the population. Nevertheless diagnosis of a von Willebrand Syndrom Typ 1 is still challenging. In a newer publication (1), 30 studies about the haemostatic variables during the menstrual cycle were compared. 11 studies were focused on the von Willebrand parameters but only in one study these parameters in patients with von Willebrand disease were observed. We investigated possible cyclic variations in women with menorrhagia, which can lead to a diagnosis of a coagulation disorder. Samples and Methods We conducted a laboratory workup in 122 women sent to our lab for menorrhagia. The following tests were conducted: Blood count, VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, VWF:CB, Fibrinogen (Clauss), activities of FII, FV, FVII, FVIII (clotting and chromogenic), FIX, FX, FXI, FXII, FXIII during the menstrual cycle on predefined time points (day 1-6, day 7-11, day 12-18, day 19-23, day 24-28). Results In 51 (40%) patients a von Willebrand disease could be detected, 37% hat other coagulation disorders like p. e. factor-VII-deficieny and factor-XIII-deficiency. 11.5% had an iron deficiency. In 11.5% no coagulation disorder could be found. In patients with von Willebrand disease we found cyclic variations especially in the VWF:Ag (p = 0.02). They showed the lowest level during the ovulation. For other coagulation parameters no significance for variations during the menstrual cycle were found. Conclusion There are cyclic variations in von Willebrand antigen. To investigate women on predefined time points during the menstrual cycle can be useful to diagnose a von Willebrand disease particularly in mild cases in which no other suspicious bleeding symptoms exists.
