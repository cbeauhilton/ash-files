    "abstract_text": "Primitive megakaryocytes (PMs) have been first observed in murine embroynal yolk sac [ Xu et al. Blood . 2001 Apr 1; 97 (7): 2016 \u201322 .]. The biological characteristics and functional aspects of human primitive megakaryocytes are not well established even though they can be transiently observed by bone marrow stromal cell (OP9) co-culture methodology [ Gaur, M et al J Thromb Haemost.  2006 Feb; 4 (2): 436 \u201342. ; Eto K et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.  2002 Oct 1; 99 (20): 12819 \u201324. ]. The goal of this study is to charaterize PMs\u2019 unique biological and functional features. To obtain a pure population of human primitive megakaryocytes, human embryonic stem (hES) cells were cultured to form embryoid bodies. CD34+/CD31+/VE-Cadherin+/Flk-1+ hemangioblasts on day 12 were isolated and further cultured for 10\u201312 days in media containing thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin 3 (IL3), stem cell factor (SCF). 30% of the non-adherent cells were strongly positive for CD31/CD41/CD61/CD42b, and weakly positive for CD42a/CD45/beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) but negative for CD117 or HLA-DR. The DNA ploidies are exclusively 2N\u20138N confirming the primitive status of PMs. Morphologically when compared to bone marrow derived megakaryocytes, PMs readily produce long processes with chains of \u201cproplatelet\u201d like structures. By live videomicroscopy, these \u201cproplatelet\u201d structures can actively recruit mitochondria. Interestingly, \u201cplatelet-like\u201d fragment shedding from megakaryocytes is significantly stimulated in the presence of nitric oxide and human plasma. The \u201cplatelet-like\u201d fragments and megakaryocytes respond to strong agonists, including thrombin and TRAP, with aggregation, alpha granule release and increased affinity for fibrinogen. In contrast, weaker agonists such as ADP only generate minimal response. This study provides preliminary evidence that primitive megakaryocytes have acquired some basic machinery of hemostasis even when the blood flow, liver function and coagulation factors are not present at the early phase of embryonal development.
