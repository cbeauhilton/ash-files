    "abstract_text": "Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) undergo self-renewing cell divisions and maintain blood production for their lifetime. Appropriate control of HSC self-renewal is critical for maintenance of haematopoietic homeostasis. Here we show that activation of p38 MAPK limits lifespan of HSCs in response to increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo . Although normal quiescent HSCs maintain a low level of oxidative stress, an increase in ROS was observed in HSCs after transplantation as well as in aged mice. In vitro treatment with BSO (Buthionine sulfoximine), which depletes intra-cellular glutathion, increased ROS (H 2 O 2 ) level in immature hematopoietic cell population, c-kit + Sca1 + Lin - (KSL) cells, in a dose-dependent manner. Low dose concentration of BSO suppressed reconstitution capacity of HSCs, whereas higher concentration did not affect progenitors. These data indicate that HSCs are much more sensitive to increased ROS than progenitors and are consistent with our previous results from Atm \u2212/\u2212 mice in which ROS level is elevated in vivo . Here we focused on MAPKs for the stem cell dysfunction since it has been shown that several MAPKs are activated in response to ROS. We evaluated effects of MAPK inhibitors for p38, JNK or ERK in incubation of KSL cell with BSO. p38 inhibitor (SB203580), neither JNK nor ERK inhibitor, restored reconstitution capacity of HSCs after transplantation, suggesting that activation of p38 may contributes to defect of stem cell function in vivo . To address the question, we evaluated p38 activation in Atm \u2212/\u2212 BM cells by immunohistochemistry. Surprisingly, p38 protein was phosphorylated only in KSL cells, but not other more differentiated cell populations, despite that the ROS levels were comparable among the cell population of mice. In response to activation of p38, p16 INK4a was up-regulated only in KSL cells. The data indicates a possibility that stem cell-specific p38 activation negatively regulates self-renewal of HSCs. We then investigated a role of p38 activation on self-renewal of HSCs in vivo . When p38 inhibitor was intraperitoneally administered both before and after BMT, the level of repopulation achieved was comparable to that of the wild-type. Furthermore, Atm \u2212/\u2212 mice that received long-term p38 inhibitor treatment did not show either anemia, a decrease in progenitor colony-forming capacity, or reduced frequencies of stem cell subsets. These data demonstrate that the activation of p38 present in HSCs promotes the exhaustion of stem cell pool in response to elevation of ROS. It has been proposed that aging is driven in part by a gradual depletion of stem cell functional capacity. There are evidences that inappropriate production of oxidants is connected to aging and life span. We propose a possibility that p38 activation in response to ROS plays a critical role for limit of stem cell capacity.",
