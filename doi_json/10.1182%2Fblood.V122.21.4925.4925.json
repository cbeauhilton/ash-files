    "abstract_text": "Currently, serious toxicity and poor antitumor efficacy resulting from the induction of multidrug resistance (MDR) in hematological malignancies and solid tumors are common hindrances to successful systemic chemotherapy. One of the important mechanisms of tumorigenesis and resistance to anticancer drugs was blockade of the apoptosis-inducing pathway. In order to overcome tumor MDR while maintaining good antitumor activity, biomaterial combine with gene therapy provides a novel strategy for the treatment of MDR.The aim of this study was to explore the induction of apoptosis by magnetic nanoparticle of Fe 3 O 4 (MNPs-Fe 3 O 4 ), a novel delivery system for chemotherapeutic regimen that is chemically stable, environmentally friendly, and noncytotoxic, copolymerizating JNK1shRNA expression vector with DNR, which could overcome siRNA technique instability and enhance DNR chemotherapeutic efficiency and provide a new field to reverse tumor MDR. JNK1shRNA expression vector was constructed and screened the most effective plasmid and transfected the cells. Typical apoptotic characteristics and apoptosis effect of MNPs-Fe 3 O 4 and PGM-3 with DNR were investigated by DAPI staining and FCM assay, respectively. Additionally, drug accumulation and apoptosis relative-genes were evaluated in K562/AO2 leukemia cells.The results showed that PGCsilencer-U6-neo-GFP-GV102 shRNA/JNK1 was successfully constructed, which was confirmed by sequencing that expression of JNK1 gene in mRNA and protein level that had the less in PGM-3 than that of PGM-1 or PGM-2. Meanwhile, MNPs-Fe 3 O 4 and PGM-3 with DNR (DNR/PGM-3/MNPs-Fe 3 O 4 ) could synergistically induced typical apoptotic characteristics of chromatin condensation and apoptotic body with DAPI staining, and a higher rate of apoptosis were detected in K562/A02 cells treated with DNR/PGM-3/MNPs-Fe 3 O 4 . Intracellular DNR was higher in K562/A02 cells treated with DNR/PGM-3/MNPs-Fe 3 O 4 than that of DNR/MNPs-Fe 3 O 4 by FCM analysis.\u00a0 Further study demonstrated that both DNR/PGM-3/MNPs-Fe 3 O 4 and DNR/PGM-3 reduced the gene transcriptions and protein expressions of bcl-2, enhanced that of bax and caspase-3, decreased survivin in protein level, and has no different change in mRNA level by qRT-PCR and Western blotting analyses, respectively. These findings showed that the combination of MNPs-Fe 3 O 4 with JNK1 shRNA expression vector and DNR could induce apoptosis of K562/A02 cells through elevating the ratio of bax/bcl-2, activating caspase-3, and decreasing survivin in protein level.
