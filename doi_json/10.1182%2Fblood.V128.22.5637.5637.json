    "abstract_text": "\u3010Abstract\u3011 Objective Multiple myeloma (MM) is a kind of plasma cell malignancy tumor with larger heterogeneity. Patient's survival varies greatly. This study retrospectively analyzed serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in 107 cases of elderly MM patients, to discuss its correlation with other clinical indicators of MM and the prognostic significance. Methods 107 cases of elderly MM patients were selected from our hospital from July 2008 to January 2016 as the research objects, all of whom were above 60 years and were newly diagnosed. OLIPAS AU5400 fully automatic biochemical analyzer was used to assay serum LDH concentration, and prognosis analysis was carried out combined with patients' clinical data. On this basis, 73 cases of MM patients were given R-ISS staging. Results At primary diagnosis, about 9.4% patients had increased LDH (10/107), with the median follow-up time of 15 (1-88.5) months. Median overall survival (OS) was 52.5\u00b16.9 months in normal LDH group, while 15.5\u00b15.2 (months) in elevated LDH group, and there were statistically significant differences (p<0.001); Median progression free survival (PFS) was 24.0\u00b13.5 months in normal LDH group, while 12.0\u00b110.5 monthsin elevated LDH group, and there were statistically significant differences (p=0.008). Multiple factors analysis showed that LDH was an independent prognosis factor of elderly MM. Median OS of patients was 44 and 72 months (p=0.820) with stage II and stage III of ISS staging, while median PFS was 23 and 22 months (p=0.963); Median OS of patients was 44 and 22.5 months (p=0.308) with stage II and stage III of R-ISS staging, while median PFS was 24 and 14 months (p=0.105). Conclusions LDH is one of the important indicators for prognostic judgment of elderly MM patients. R-ISS staging based on LDH level is superior to the ISS staging system in prognostic judgment.
