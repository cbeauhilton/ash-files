    "abstract_text": "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a disease of hematopoietic stem cell membrane defects due to acquired PIG-A mutation. Our previous study found some secondary gene mutations in PNH patients by WES. However, it is not clear exactly which mutations are associated with the disease. So, 97 target genes were selected as a target gene panel and tested in 23 PNH patients by DNA sequencing of specific target regions. We found that all PNH patients had other gene mutations except PIG-A mutations, including TTN, NCOR2, CPS1, MUC4, SUZ12, LFNG, CELSR2, JAK2, SETBP1 and KMT2D (Figure1A). Through harmful analysis, KEGG enrichment, GO enrichment analysis and protein interaction analysis, we screened out the secondary mutant gene SUZ12 that may be involved in the cloning proliferation of PNH. We detected the mRNA and protein expression levels of SUZ12 and H3K27me3 methylation in PNH patients and health volunteers, the results showed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of SUZ12 and H3K27me3 methylation in peripheral blood CD59 - cells of PNH patients were higher than those in CD59 + cells of PNH patients and healthy controls (Figure1B). The relative expression level of SUZ12 in peripheral blood CD59 - cells of PNH patients was correlated with ( r =0.4162, p =0.0385), CD59 - erythrocyte ratio ( r =0.4636, p =0.0196), CD59 - monocyte ratio ( r =0.4052, p =0.0495), Flaer - monocyte ratio ( r =0.6769, p =0.0004) and Flaer - granulocytic ratio ( r =0.6146, p =0.0018), indicating that SUZ12 may be involved in abnormal PNH cloning and proliferation by regulating H3K27me3. To verify the role of SUZ12 in the proliferation of PNH cloning, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knockdown PIG-A expression in THP-1 cells to construct A PNH cell model, the expression level of PIG-A protein in the cell model was significantly decreased, and the proportion of CD59 - cells accounted was stable at 95%. Then lentivirus transfection was used to knockdown the expression of SUZ12 in PNH cell model. The results showed when the SUZ12 expression was knockdown, the methylation level of histone H3K27me3 was decreased, the cell proliferation activity was decreased, apoptosis was increased, and the cell cycle was arrested at G0/G1 phase. The proportion of CD59 + cells increased gradually from 3 weeks after transfection, and significantly increased at 4 weeks after transfection, while no changes were observed in the empty virus group and control group (Figure1C). Four weeks after lentivirus transfection, the expression of PIG-A protein recovered in SUZ12 knockdown group compared with empty virus group and control group (Figure1D). In conclusion, SUZ12 mutation leads to the overexpression of SUZ12, which can affect cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle by regulating the methylation level of histone H3K27me3, thereby promoting the proliferation of PNH abnormal cloning and participating in the pathogenesis of PNH.
