    "abstract_text": "NIMA (Never In Mitosis Gene A)-Related Kinase 2 (Nek2), a centrosomal Serine/Threonine kinase, is a key player in numerous malignancies. Overexpression of Nek2 has been related to many cancers including Multiple Myeloma (MM). In MM, Nek2 is one of the chromosomal instability genes associated with drug resistance and disease relapse. However, very little is known about the mechanisms that lead to these Nek2-driven disparities. Here, we show that the Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 7 (USP7) stabilizes Nek2 leading to activation of NF-kb pathway. Using gene expression profile (GEP) data from patients and cell lines we discovered that Nek2 overexpression leads to increases of several targets of the NF-kb pathway. We, thus, hypothesize that Nek2 is activating NF-kb. To address this, we overexpressed Nek2 and tested the classic canonical NF-kb hallmarks proteins by western blotting. Nek2 overexpression led to an increase in phosphorylation of IKK, activator of NF-kb, and to decrease levels of IKb-alpha, a negative regulator of the pathway. Nek2 overexpression also increased nuclear and phosphorylated p65 on residue S536, known as active transcriptional site. To further confirm that Nek2 is activating canonical NF-kb luciferase assay was performed. The luciferase reporter is driven by a p65 promoter and in cells overexpressing Nek2 luciferase levels were increased. To characterize Nek2 interacting partners a tandem affinity purification/mass spectrometry (TAP/MS) approach was performed. We found that Nek2 binds to Usp7, a deubiquitinase overexpressed in numerous cancers. This led to hypothesize that that Nek2, a known target of the ubiquitin proteasome system, is being stabilized by the Usp7 contributing to its overexpression and the increased activation of the NF-kb pathway. To test our hypothesis, we treated different cancer cell lines with the commercially available Usp7 inhibitor, P5091, or silenced the protein using shRNA. In both case, we found a reduction in Nek2 protein level. Additionally, we overexpressed Usp7 and Nek2 increased confirming that Usp7 stabilizes Nek2. To further show that Usp7 stabilizes Nek2 by de-ubiquitination, we overexpressed Usp7 and analyzed Nek2 ubiquitination after immunoprecipitation. When Usp7 was overexpressed no ubiquitination of Nek2 was detected. Finally, by using GEP data from MM patients, we found that individuals who overexpressed Nek2 along with an active NF-kb signature have worst event free survival as well as overall survival, indicating Nek2 overexpression leading to increased NF-kb signature has clinical significance.
