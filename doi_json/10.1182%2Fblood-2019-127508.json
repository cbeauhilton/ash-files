    "abstract_text": "Background : CAR T cell therapies have demonstrated high response rates in patients (pts) with R/R B cell NHL. Liso-cel is an investigational anti-CD19, defined composition, 4-1BB CAR T cell product administered at target doses of CD4+ and CD8+ CAR T cells. The seamless phase 1 TRANSCEND NHL 001 study evaluated liso-cel in pts with R/R large B cell NHL (NCT02631044). We present data with long-term follow-up from pts treated in the DLBCL cohort. Methods: Pts aged \u226518 yrs in the DLBCL cohort had R/R DLBCL not otherwise specified (NOS; including transformed from any indolent lymphoma), high-grade B cell lymphoma (HGBCL) with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements, primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), or follicular lymphoma grade 3B (FL3B). Pts had R/R disease after \u22652 lines of therapy and ECOG PS 0\u20122. Pts with grade 3/4 cytopenias, mild-moderate organ dysfunction, and secondary CNS lymphoma were eligible. Bridging therapy was allowed, but pts had to have PET-positive disease before lymphodepletion (LD) with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Liso-cel was administered at 1 of 3 target dose levels (DLs) of 50\u00d710 6 (DL1), 100\u00d710 6 (DL2), or150\u00d710 6 (DL3) viable CAR+ T cells in the dose-finding cohorts. All dose levels were expanded, and DL2 was chosen as the target DL for dose confirmation. Primary endpoints were treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included CR rate, DOR, PFS, PFS ratio, and OS. TEAEs, including investigator-identified neurological events (NE) related to liso-cel, were graded using CTCAE criteria; CRS was graded per the Lee criteria (2014). ORR was assessed by independent review using the Lugano criteria. Data from all liso-cel-treated pts in the DLBCL cohort were analyzed across DLs. Results: A total of 342 pts were leukapheresed; 268 pts received liso-cel (DL1, n=51; DL2, n=176; DL3, n=41). Twenty-four pts received nonconforming product; product could not be manufactured for 2 pts. Pts did not receive liso-cel primarily due to death (n=33). In the optimized manufacturing process, median time from leukapheresis to liso-cel availability was 24 days. Median age was 63 (range, 18\u201286) yrs, including older subpopulations (\u226565 yrs, 41%; \u226575 yrs, 10%); 65% of pts were male. At screening, 58% had ECOG PS 1. Pts were heavily pretreated and had aggressive disease: 26% had \u22654 prior lines of systemic therapy (median of 3; range, 1\u20128); 34% underwent prior auto-HSCT and 3% prior allo-HSCT; 67% were chemorefractory; and 44% had never achieved CR. 59% required bridging therapy. 22% had LDH \u2265500 U/L and 28% had SPD \u226550 cm 2 before LD. Outcomes were similar between DLs; therefore, data were pooled. Twenty-five pts were treated in the outpatient setting. Safety analysis showed 79% of pts had grade \u22653 TEAEs, primarily cytopenias (neutropenia, 60%; anemia, 37%; thrombocytopenia, 27%). CRS or NE occurred in 47% of pts. Any grade CRS occurred in 42% of pts at a median onset of 5 days; only 2% had grade \u22653 CRS. NEs occurred in 30% of pts (grade \u22653, 10%) at a median onset of 9 days (Table). 19% of pts received tocilizumab and 21% received corticosteroids for CRS and/or NEs. Four grade 5 TEAEs related to liso-cel and LD occurred (diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary hemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, cardiomyopathy). Prolonged grade \u22653 cytopenia (based on laboratory assessment at Day 29) was reported in 37% of pts. Safety was similar between age groups, histologies, and pts with organ dysfunction. The study met all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. Among pts evaluable for efficacy (n=255), ORR was 73% (95% CI, 67\u201278); the CR rate was 53% (95% CI, 47\u201259). Responses were similar across all pt subgroups (Table). Median DOR was 13.3 mo (95% CI, 8.2\u2012not reached [NR]) with 10.8 mo of median follow-up; median DOR for pts in CR was NR (13.3\u2012NR). Median PFS was 6.8 mo (95% CI, 3.3\u201211.8). Median OS was 19.9 mo (95% CI, 10.9\u2012NR). Overall, PFS after liso-cel infusion was substantially longer than PFS from the immediate prior therapy. Conclusions: Liso-cel demonstrated durable clinical activity with a favorable safety profile in this large study of CAR T cell therapy in R/R large B cell NHL. Low incidence and late onset of CRS and NE allowed for outpatient administration. Clinically meaningful efficacy was observed across histologic subgroups and those with poor prognosis, including pts who were refractory, elderly, comorbid, and/or had high tumor burden.
