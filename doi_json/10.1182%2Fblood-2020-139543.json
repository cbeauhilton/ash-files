    "abstract_text": "Multiorgan thromboses and subsequent organ failure are among the more devastating consequences of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). APS poses a relatively unique risk to patients by virtue of its propensity to cause thrombi of both the arterial and venous vascular systems. While recent studies have explored mechanisms of thrombosis in singular vascular beds, there remains a dearth of targetable effectors of arteriovenous thrombosis in APS. Here, we examine the potential of neutrophils as key players of both arterial and venous thrombosis in APS. From this and previous studies, we have also identified a critical transcriptional regulator in neutrophils whose loss mimics arterial and venous thrombosis susceptibility seen in APS. This factor, Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), is down regulated in APS patients as well as in cells treated with antiphospholipid antibody (APLA) ex vivo . Loss of KLF2 in neutrophils contributes to classic neutrophil activation phenotypes including NETosis, increased tissue factor release, and heightened chemotaxis; remarkably, blocking each of these functions greatly abrogates the thrombotic phenotype. Utilizing the myeloid KLF2 knockout (K2KO) system as a model for aberrant neutrophil activation seen in APS, we have identified clustering of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) secondary to actin rearrangement to be operative in neutrophil-mediated thrombosis in arterial and venous systems. While neutralizing antibodies against PSGL-1 have been explored as therapeutic options in APS, there remains a challenge in establishing local specificity to activated immune cells in order to increase efficacy. To circumvent this, we have designed a nanoparticle (NP) based approach that utilizes NPs decorated with anti-PSGL-1 immunoglobulins to better target clustered PSGL-1 on activated neutrophils. PSGL-1 NPs are more effective at inhibiting neutrophil rolling and adhesion in in vitro assays while, incubating activated neutrophils in PSGL-1 NPs prior to infusion attenuates their ability to contribute to both arterial and venous thrombosis. Further, injection of PSGL-1 NPs directly into K2KO mice reduces their extensive thrombotic phenotype. Importantly, this effect occurs at a substantially lower dose of PSGL-1 NPs than that which would be needed of PSGL-1 antibody alone. Finally, PSGL-1 NPs greatly reduce thrombotic burden in mice injected with APLA, diminishing clotting in both arteries and veins. Together, this work identifies key molecular and cellular players in APLA-induced arteriovenous thrombosis. Furthermore, it provides early pre-clinical evidence at specifically targeting clustered PSGL-1 on neutrophils as a viable option in combatting thrombosis in this particularly vulnerable patient population.
