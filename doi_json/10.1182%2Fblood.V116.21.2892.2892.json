    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2892 Activating mutations of FLT3 are frequent in patients with AML. Two types of mutations are most common: Internal tandem duplications (ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain in approximately 30% of patients and point mutations within the second tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) in about 7% of AML patients. Patients carrying the FLT3-ITD mutation have a significantly worse prognosis whereas FLT3-TKD mutations do not appear to influence the clinical outcome. Studies have shown that mice receiving a transplant of bone marrow expressing FLT3 ITD develop a myeloproliferative disease. In contrast, mice which were transplanted with FLT3 TKD infected bone marrow, suffer from a lymphoid disease. Thus, both FLT3 mutations seem to exert different biological functions. Interestingly, FLT3-ITD but not FLT3-TKD or FLT3-WT leads to a strong activation of the STAT5 signaling pathway. Recently we have shown that c-SRC is the crucial signaling mediator of FLT3 ITD to activate STAT5. Based on these findings we investigated the effect of FLT3 inhibitors (Midostaurin, Sorafenib and Sunitinib) in combination with c-SRC inhibitors (Dasatinib and PD166-326) on FLT3 ITD and FLT3 TKD murine and human cell lines as well as on primary patient material. In FLT3 ITD expressing murine myeloid 32D cells c-SRC inhibitors in combination with FLT3 inhibitors showed clear additive effects on growth inhibition, apoptosis and activation of STAT5. In contrast, c-SRC inhibitors had no additional effects in FLT3 TKD expressing cells. Accordingly, a strong additive effect of c-SRC and FLT3 inhibitors could also be demonstrated in the FLT3 ITD positive human AML cell line MV4-11. Finally FLT3 ITD and FLT3 TKD positive primary human AML cells were investigated. We were able to detect a significant additional growth inhibition of FLT3 ITD positive human cells by combining c-SRC and FLT3 inhibitors. In contrast, no further growth inhibition was observed by c-SRC inhibition in primary AML cells expressing the FLT3 TKD mutation. Together our results confirm c-SRC as a crucial signaling mediator in FLT3-ITD but not FLT3-TKD positive AML. The combination of FLT3 and c-SRC inhibitors warrants further investigation in FLT3 ITD positive AML. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
