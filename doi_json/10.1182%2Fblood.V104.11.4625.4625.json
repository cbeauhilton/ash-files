    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Rituximab combined with chemotherapy has been recommended as first-line or second-line standard regimen in most subtypes of B-cell lymphoma in China by the 2004 National Comprehensive Cancer Network lymphoma therapy guideline. We have conducted a multicenter trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab in combination with standard chemotherapy (CHOP) in patients with previously untreated or relapsed indolent and aggressive NHL. Methods: Patients received 4\u20138 cycles of rituximab plus CHOP every 21 days. For each cycle, rituximab (375mg/m 2 ) was given on day 1 and CHOP started on day 3. CHOP consisted of cyclophosphamide 750mg/m 2 , doxorubicin 50mg/m 2 , and vincristine 1.4mg/m 2 (maximum 2mg/dose) given intravenously on day 3, and oral prednisone 100mg on days 3\u20137. Results: A total of 221 patients were enrolled on the trial, 128 males and 93 females with a mean age of 49 years (range 10\u201383 years). The main lymphoma subtypes were small lymphocytic (15 patients, 7%), follicular (27 patients, 12%), and diffuse large B-cell (160 patients, 72%). In total, 56 patients had indolent NHL and 165 aggressive NHL. The overall response rate for all patients was 86% with 57% complete responses. In patients with indolent NHL the overall and complete response rates were 95% and 55% respectively. After a median 12 months follow up, progression-free survival in patients with indolent NHL was 88%\u00b15% at 1 year and 83%\u00b16% at 2 years. In the 160 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the overall response rate was 88% with 61% complete responses, and after a mean follow-up of 6 months, predicted 1-year and 2-year progression-free survival were 88%\u00b15% and 83%\u00b17% respectively. Infusion-related adverse events occurred in 4% of patients, associated with the first infusion of rituximab. Subanalyses according to subtype, stage, IPI and other factors will be presented. Conclusion: Rituximab plus chemotherapy is an effective, well-tolerated treatment that achieves high response rates and long progression-free survival in both indolent and aggressive NHL."
