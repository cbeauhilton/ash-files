    "abstract_text": "Cell-mediated immunity is essential for control of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. We utilized a pool of 138 synthetic overlapping pentadecapeptides over-spanning the entire pp65 protein to generate polyclonal CMV-specific T-cell lines from 12 CMV-seropositive donors inheriting different HLA genotypes. Autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with this complete pool consistently induced highly specific T-cells and in analyses of T-cell lines from 5 separate HLA-A*0201 + individuals demonstrate that this pp65-derived pentadecapeptide-pool selectively induced T-cells specifically reactive against sub-pools of pentadecapeptides which contained the HLA-A*0201 binding epitope NLVPMVATV. The specificity of these T-cells for this immunodominant nonapeptide was confirmed by MHC-tetramer staining and intracellular interferon-\u03b3 production, demonstrating that 38 \u2013 60% of the CD8 + cell population were specific for this A*2-restricted peptide after 3 weeks of culture. These T cells also killed both nonapeptide-pulsed and CMV-infected target cells. In subsequent experiments using auotlogous monocyte-derived DC\u2019s pulsed with the pentadecapeptide pool for the stimulation of CMV-specific T-cell lines in individuals other than HLA-A*2, the generated T cells selectively recognized 1\u20133 pentadecapeptides identified by secondary responses to a mapping grid of pentadecapeptide subpools with single overlaps. Responses against peptide loaded targets sharing single HLA class I or II alleles permitted the identification the restricting HLA alleles. Those T-cell lines from HLA-A*2 neg. donors contained high frequencies of CD4 and/or CD8 T-cells selectively reactive against peptides presented by other HLA alleles including known epitopes such as aa 341\u2013350 QYDPVAALF (HLA-A*2402) as well as unreported epitopes such as aa 267\u2013275 HERNGFTVL (HLA-B*4001 and B* 4002). In some donors, the peptide-specific IFN-g + T-cells generated have been predominantly CD4 + T-cells. Like the peptide-specific CD8 + T-cells, we could determine both epitope and HLA-class II restricting element, e.g. aa513\u2013523 FFWDANDIYRI (HLA-DRB1* 1301). These CD4 + T-cells also consistently exhibited cytotoxic activity against infected targets as well as peptide-loaded cells expressing the restricting HLA class II allele. Thus, synthetic overlapping pentadecapeptides spanning the sequence of the immunodominant protein of CMV-pp65, when loaded on DCs can consistently stimulate the in vitro generation of CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell lines from seropositive donors of diverse HLA genotypes. These cell lines are selectively enriched for T-cells specific for a limited number of immunodominant epitopes each presented by a single HLA class I or class II allele. This approach fosters expansion and selection of HLA-restricted CMV-pp65-reactive T-cell lines of high specificity which also lyse CMV-infected targets and may have advantages for generating virus-specific T-cells for adoptive immunotherapy.",
