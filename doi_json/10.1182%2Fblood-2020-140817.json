    "abstract_text": "Splicing is a fundamental process by which introns are removed from primary RNA transcripts. Alternative splicing is a major mechanism of gene regulation by which eukaryotic cells expand their transcriptional repertoire. By contrast, aberrant splicing generates novel transcripts not found in normal cells. Heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in a core U2 spliceosome factor SF3B1 are present in ~25% of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Strikingly, SF3B1 mutations are present in ~80% of MDS with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS) patients suggesting a causal connection between mutant SF3B1 and ring sideroblasts (RS), erythroid precursors with iron-laden mitochondria (Yoshida et al. Nature 2011, Papaemmanuil et al. NEJM 2011). However, the mechanism by which SF3B1 mutations cause RS formation remains poorly understood since existing models of SF3B1-mutant MDS do not recapitulate RS formation in vitro . We have established an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model of MDS-RS that recapitulates mutant SF3B1-mediated mis-splicing and in vitro ring sideroblast formation. We reprogrammed SF3B1-mutant and SF3B1-wild-type iPSCs from individual MDS-RS patients enabling internal normalization to the isogenic normal clone (Hsu et al. Blood 2019). We established expandable multipotential HPC lines by conditional expression of five transcription factors (5F-HPC), followed by an 18-day erythroid differentiation. We monitored RS formation during the erythroid differentiation of 5F-HPCs using Prussian blue histological staining. RS formation increased during terminal erythropoiesis and peaked at 25-40% on day 18 in SF3B1-mutant lines, whereas SF3B1-wild-type lines showed no detectable RS formation. The frequency of RS was similar in isogenic SF3B1-only and SF3B1/EZH2 co-mutant cells suggesting that the mutant SF3B1 is sufficient to drive RS formation. To identify mis-splicing events that contribute to RS formation, we performed RNA-sequencing and splicing analysis of SF3B1-mutant and SF3B1-wild-type iPSCs at three stages of erythroid differentiation: CD34+ progenitor, CD71+ early erythroblast, and CD71+Glycophorin A+ erythroblast. Global isoform usage was dramatically altered during erythropoiesis, but was more similar in stage-matched SF3B1-mutant and SF3B1-wild-type cells suggesting that mutant SF3B1 selectively mis-splices a subset of transcripts. We identified 2300 transcripts with >10% mis-splicing in SF3B1-mutant lines, and only 120 transcripts with more significant >40% mis-splicing. Of these, TMEM14C and PPOX , inner mitochondrial membrane components of the heme synthesis pathway were strongly mis-spliced throughout erythroid differentiation, consistent with previous studies (Conte et al. BJHaem 2015, Shiozawa et al. Nat Commun 2018). The transcript levels of PPOX but not TMEM14C were reduced in SF3B1-mutant lines as a result of mis-splicing. The expression of ABCB7 , a mitochondrial iron sulfur cluster biogenesis component mutated in inherited X-linked sideroblastic anemia (Allikmets et al. Hum Mol Genet 1999), was also reduced in SF3B1-mutant cells as expected (Shiozawa et al. Nat Commun 2018, Dolatshad et al. Leukemia 2016). To investigate the role of these mis-splicing events in ring sideroblast formation, we performed lentiviral overexpression of TMEM14C , PPOX , and ABCB7 , in SF3B1-mutant 5F-HPCs and quantified RS formation during late stages of erythroid differentiation. Overexpression of TMEM14C and ABCB7 in SF3B1-mutant cells partially but not completely rescued RS formation compared to luciferase control. These findings confirm the long-standing hypothesis that mis-splicing of mitochondrial iron metabolism genes causes RS formation. Furthermore, these findings suggest that RS formation in MDS is a multigenic event caused by coordinated but incomplete mis-splicing of several critical iron metabolism genes.
