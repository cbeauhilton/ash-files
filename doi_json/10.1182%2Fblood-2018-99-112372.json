    "abstract_text": "The leukemogenic AML1-ETO fusion protein is produced by the t(8;21) translocation, which is one of the most common chromosomal abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In leukemic cells, AML1-ETO resides in and functions through a stable protein complex, AETFC, that contains multiple transcription factors and cofactors. Among these AETFC components, E2A (also known as TCF3) and HEB (also known as TCF12), two members of the ubiquitously expressed E proteins, directly interact with AML1-ETO, confer new DNA (E-box) binding capacity to AETFC, and are functionally essential for leukemogenesis. However, we find that the third E protein, E2-2 (also known as TCF4), is specifically silenced in AML1-ETO-expressing leukemic cells, suggesting E2-2 as a negative factor of leukemogenesis. Indeed, ectopic expression of E2-2 selectively inhibits the growth of AML1-ETO-expressing leukemic cells, and this inhibition requires the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) DNA-binding domain of E2-2. Gene expression profiling and ChIP-seq analysis reveal that, despite some overlap, the three E proteins differentially regulate many target genes. In particular, consistent with the fact that E2-2 is a critical transcription factor in dendritic cell (DC) development, our studies show that E2-2 both redistributes AETFC to, and activates, some genes associated with DC differentiation, and that restoration of E2-2 triggers a partial differentiation of the AML1-ETO-expressing leukemic cells into the DC lineage. Meanwhile, E2-2, but not E2A or HEB, represses MYC target genes, which may also contribute to leukemic cell differentiation and apoptosis. In AML patients, the expression of E2-2 is relatively lower in the t(8;21) subtype, and an E2-2 target gene, THPO, is identified as a potential predictor of relapse. In a mouse model of human t(8;21) leukemia, E2-2 suppression accelerates the development of leukemia. Taken together, these results reveal that, in contrast to HEB and E2A, which facilitate AML1-ETO-mediated leukemogenesis, E2-2 compromises the function of AETFC and negatively regulates leukemogenesis. The three E proteins thus define a molecular heterogeneity of AETFC, which merits further study in different t(8;21) AML patients, as well as in its potential regulation of cellular heterogeneity of AML. These studies should improve our understanding of the precise mechanism of leukemogenesis and assist development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
