    "abstract_text": "We recently reported that Swedish V H 3-21-utilizing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients showed restricted immunoglobulin gene features and poor prognosis despite V H mutation status. To investigate whether V H 3-21 + CLLs have similar characteristics in different parts of the world, we analyzed the V H and V L gene rearrangements in 90 patients from Sweden, Germany, Italy, USA, Finland and Australia and correlated these data with survival. Sixty-three percent of cases exhibited mutated V H genes and 37% had unmutated V H genes. Fifty patients (56%) displayed a short and homologous heavy-chain CDR3, many of these with the amino acid motif, DANGMDV. Also, a highly biased V \u03bb 2-14 usage was evident in 73% of patients with a restricted light-chain CDR3, QVWDS(S/G)SDHPWV. Combined restricted heavy- and light-chain CDR3s were found in patients from all included countries. Although V H 3-21 + CLLs have a remarkably predominant \u03bb-expression, analyses of kappa deleting element showed a conserved rearrangement order of the light-chain loci. The overall survival was poor in the V H 3-21 + cohort (median survival 88 months) with no significant difference in relation to mutation status or homologous/non-homologous CDR3. In summary, highly restricted B-cell receptors and worse outcome characterize V H 3-21 + CLLs independent of geographical origin and mutation status. V H 3-21 usage should now be included in prognostic stratification of CLL when assessing mutation status.",
