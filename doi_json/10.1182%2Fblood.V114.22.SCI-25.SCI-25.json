    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-25 Systemic iron balance is regulated by the key iron regulatory hormone hepcidin. Secreted by the liver, hepcidin inhibits iron absorption from the diet and iron mobilization from body stores by decreasing cell surface expression of the iron export protein ferroportin. Iron administration increases hepcidin expression, thereby providing a feedback mechanism to limit further iron absorption, while anemia and hypoxia inhibit hepcidin expression, thereby increasing iron availability for erythropoiesis. Hepcidin excess is thought to have a role in the anemia of inflammation, while hepcidin deficiency is thought to be the common pathogenic mechanism underlying the iron overload disorder hereditary hemochromatosis, due to mutations in the genes encoding hepcidin itself (HAMP), HFE, transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2), or hemojuvelin (HFE2). Notably the precise molecular mechanisms by which iron levels are \u201csensed\u201d and how this iron \u201csignal\u201d is transduced to modulate hepcidin expression have remained elusive. We have recently discovered that hemojuvelin is a co-receptor for the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, and that hemojuvelin-mediated BMP signals increase hepcidin expression at the transcriptional level. In addition to patients with HFE2 mutations and Hfe2 knockout mice, other genetic mouse models associated with impaired hepatic BMP signaling through a global knockout of the ligand Bmp6, or selective hepatic knockout of an intracellular mediator of BMP signaling, Smad4, also cause inappropriately low hepcidin expression and iron overload. Exogenous BMP6 administration in mice increases hepatic hepcidin expression and reduces serum iron, while BMP6 antagonists inhibit hepatic hepcidin expression, mobilize reticuloendothelial cell iron stores and increase serum iron. Not only does the BMP6-hemojuvelin-SMAD pathway regulate hepcidin expression and thereby systemic iron homeostasis, but also the BMP6-SMAD pathway itself is regulated by iron. Acute iron administration in mice increases phosphorylation of Smad proteins in the liver, and chronic changes in dietary iron modulate hepatic Bmp6 mRNA expression and phosphorylation of Smad proteins concordantly with Hamp mRNA expression. Together, these data support the paramount role of the BMP6-hemojuvelin-SMAD signaling pathway in the iron-mediated regulation of hepcidin expression and systemic iron homeostasis, and suggest that modulators of this pathway may be an alternative therapeutic strategy for treating disorders of iron homeostasis. Recent work elucidating the role of the BMP signaling pathway in hepcidin regulation and systemic iron homeostasis will be presented.
