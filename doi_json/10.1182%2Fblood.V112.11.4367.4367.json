    "abstract_text": "Background: GM-CSF is thought to be beneficial in SCT patients with IFI. The impact of GM-CSF in SCT recipients with GVHD and IFI was evaluated Methods: A retrospective case-matched (GM-CSF [n = 12] vs. no GM-CSF [n = 27]) study was undertaken to compare outcomes if IFIs diagnosed >100 days following transplantation during 2000\u20132006. A response was defined as complete or partial response (CR/PR) and considered 3 months after IFI diagnosis or earlier in patients with earlier response. All value are given as median \u00b1 s.d. The systemic antifungal therapy in > 60% of patients included echinocandin and anti-mold triazole, or polyene agent. Results: Please refer to the table below. Patients who received GM-CSF were younger (age 36 \u00b1 17 vs. 51 \u00b1 13 years); neutropenic (<500 cells/uL) at onset of infection (50% vs. 11%; P = 0.014); had lower monocyte counts (10 \u00b1 236 vs. 220 \u00b1 575 cells/uL; P = 0.021) and frequently required intensive care unit stay (50% vs 15%; P = 0.043). A 50% response was observed in the GM-CSF treated SCT recipients with GVHD and IFIs, whereas, 41% response occurred in the group who received no concurrent Gm-CSF (P = 0.6). Similarly, IFI-associated deaths were less frequently observed in GM-CSF treated patients (41%) compared with 55% seen in patients who had not received GM-CSF (P = 0.7). There was a slight increase in survival among SCT recipients treated with GM-CSF (48 \u00b1 21 days vs. 34 \u00b1 19 days in no GM-CSF group P = 0.05) Conclusions: Late fungal infections in SCT recipients with GVHD, when treated with GM-CSF-based therapy had comparable outcomes despite having significantly more neutropenia, severe monocytopenia and ICU stay.
