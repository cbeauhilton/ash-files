    "abstract_text": "Megakaryopoiesis is controlled by a variety of hematopoietic growth factors in order to maintain a physiological level of circulating platelets. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the main regulator of megakaryopoiesis modulating megakaryocyte differentiation, promoting endomitosis and proplatelet formation and as such supports the self-renewal and survival of hematopoietic stem cells. To allow proper proliferation and differentiation of different hematopoetic lineages, TPO signal transduction must be tightly regulated. Several mechanisms negatively modulating hematopoiesis and differentiation of the megakaryocytic lineage have previously been identified. Among those are suppressors cytokine signaling, protein phosphatases as well as a multitude of negative regulatory signaling pathways. However, one of the most effective mechanisms to permanently disable activated signaling proteins is by targeted degradation via lysosomes or proteasomes. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms that regulate TPO-mediated MPL degradation in primary mouse cells. Previous studies have identified CBL as an E3 ligase responsible for the ubiquitination of MPL in cell lines. In order to determine the potential role of c-CBL in murine thrombopoiesis, we used Cre/loxP technology to specifically delete c-CBL in the megakaryocytic lineage. Mice expressing two floxed c-CBL alleles were crossed to mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the platelet factor 4 (PF4) promoter. This yielded progeny with the desired genotype of c-CBL fl/fl PF4-Cre (CBL ko) after two generations of breeding. The desired cohort exhibited a quantitative absence of c-CBL in megakaryocytes and platelets as assessed by western blotting compared with wild type C57/BL6 mice. The expression of CBL in other hematopoietic cells such as B cells, T cells, neutrophils, monocytes and dendritic cells remained unaffected in this conditional ko strain. The experimental cohort showed significantly higher numbers of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and of platelets in the peripheral blood as compared to wild type mice (1.2 mio vs. 1.8 mio cells/\u00b5l, p<0.0001). In addition, the platelets from the mutant mouse strain were of significantly smaller size (43 vs. 38 fL, p=0.0022). To evaluate the role of c-CBL in mature megakaryocytes, total bone marrow was collected from 12 wk old CBL ko mice and grown in TPO-containing culture medium for 72 h. Megakaryocytes derived from the bone marrow of wild type mice served as controls. Mature megakaryocytes were eventually isolated on a BSA-density gradient. Subsequent Western Blot analysis revealed a significant reduction of MPL ubiquitination in the CBL ko mice as compared to wild type mice, thereby identifying c-CBL as a critical negative regulator of megakaryopoesis. Taken together, we have successfully ablated c-CBL specifically from the megakaryocyte lineage and could demonstrate that this has profound effects on platelet counts and platelet size. In addition, we were able to show that c-CBL ablation leads to reduced ubiquitination of MPL and a consecutively longer half life of this protein culminating in substantially increased megakaryopoiesis in the c-CBL ko cohort. In summary, these data enhance our understanding of the regulation of TPO signaling and the physiological role of CBL in the megakaryocytic lineage.
