    "abstract_text": "Gene transfer for hemophilia A offers the potential for a one-time disease altering treatment, eliminating the risk of bleeds while freeing patients from the burden of lifelong chronic therapy. SPK-8011 consists of a bioengineered AAV capsid expressing B domain-deleted factor VIII (FVIII) under the control of a liver-specific promoter. In pre-clinical studies, we showed a dose-dependent increase in circulating FVIII levels in non-human primates infused with SPK-8011 . We conducted a Phase I/II study of SPK-8011 in 12 men (ages 18-52 years) with severe (n=11) or moderately severe (n=1) hemophilia A. Prior to gene therapy, 8/12 subjects were on prophylaxis, and 4/12 received on-demand treatment. Subjects were enrolled in 1 of 3 dose cohorts, 5E11 vg/kg (n=2), 1E12(n=3), or 2E12(N=7). Safety analysis showed no inhibitor formation. A single serious adverse event (SAE) was reported, associated with an immune response to AAV capsid characterized by simultaneous decline in FVIII, transaminase elevation peaking at Grade 2, and development of positive IFN-g ELISPOTs to capsid was observed beginning at week 6.5 after vector infusion. The asymptomatic transaminase elevation did not respond promptly to initiation of oral steroids and the subject received two infusions of IV methylprednisolone in hospital, thereby fulfilling SAE criteria. The SAE has resolved. All vector doses led to expression of FVIII levels adequate to prevent bleeding and allow cessation of prophylaxis. Across the 12 subjects at 3 doses, there was a 97% reduction in annualized bleeding rate (ABR), and a 97% reduction in annualized infusion rate (AIR). In the 5E11 dose cohort, mean FVIII levels beginning 12 weeks post vector infusion are 13%, with no bleeding events, no elevated transaminase levels, no use of steroids, and stable FVIII expression out to 66 weeks (ongoing). In the 1E12 dose cohort, mean FVIII levels are 15% beginning at 12 weeks post-infusion and stable out to 46 weeks (ongoing). The first subject in the 1E12 dose infused a single dose of factor concentrate for a spontaneous joint bleed at day 159, and the second received multiple infusions for a traumatic bleed beginning at day 195. Declining FVIII levels triggered initiation of a course of tapering steroids in both subjects, at 12 and 7 weeks post vector infusion respectively, which led to stabilization of FVIII levels. The third subject has had no bleeding and did not receive factor infusions or steroids. In the 2E12 (highest) dose cohort, 5/7 subjects currently have FVIII levels 16-49%; their mean FVIII level beginning 12 weeks post-infusion is 30%. No bleeds have been reported among these subjects beginning 4 weeks post vector infusion. Additionally, 5/7 subjects in the 2E12 dose cohort received a course of steroids, initiated at 6-11 weeks post vector infusion, for one or more of the following: declining FVIII levels, rise in ALT above subject baseline, or elevated IFN-g ELISPOTs to AAV capsid. Steroid initiation normalized ALT levels and extinguished the ELISPOT signal in all cases; 2 subjects showed limited stabilization of FVIII levels, which fell to <6% likely due to the immune response. For one of these, no bleeds have been reported through 12 weeks of follow up; the other has had 4 bleeds through 37 weeks of observation. Our data indicate that the kinetics of SPK-8011 expression are similar to those observed with investigational SPK-9001 for hemophilia B. All subjects demonstrated durable transgene expression for up to 66 weeks post vector administration (data cutoff 7/13/18). On cumulative follow up of 345 weeks, SPK-8011 demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no evidence of FVIII inhibitor formation, a single SAE, and 2/12 subjects who experienced ALT elevation above the upper limit of normal that resolved with steroid initiation. Data from the 5E11 (lowest) dose cohort are consistent with published natural history data indicating FVIII:C 12% is adequate to prevent spontaneous bleeding events. Given that 2 subjects in the 2E12 dose cohort lost some FVIII expression, which then stabilized on steroids, and 5/7 subjects in this cohort required steroids, prophylactic steroids may be warranted. We conclude that infusion of SPK-8011 in 12 subjects with severe or moderately severe hemophilia A resulted in safe, durable, dose-dependent FVIII expression resulting in an excellent preliminary efficacy profile with an overall 97% reduction in ABR and AIR.
