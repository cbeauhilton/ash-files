    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4682 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of lower dose rituximab by adding fresh frozen plasma in the treatment of patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). METHODS: A prospective study was performed at Subei People , Hospital Affiliated to Yang Zhou University involving the use of lower dose rituximab combining fresh frozen plasma in 15 patients who had previously been treated with steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or splenectomy. Fifteen patients with refractory ITP which were unresponsive to or relapse after the above said treatment were treated with two hundreds millilitre of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) followed with rituximab (100 mg/m 2 per week for four weeks) and oral Medrol (24mg per day). Whole blood cell count in all cases and B cells of CD19 (+)/CD20 (+) were detected in eight cases before and after rituximab therapy. RESULTS: Complete response (CR) was achieved in 7 patients (46.67%), response (R) in 13(86.67%), and non-response (NR) in 2 (13.33%). The median follow-up time was 4 weeks. The median response and CR time were 7 and 14 days, respectively. CD19 (+) CD20 (+) B cells significantly decreased (P < 0.01). There were no severe adverse effects during rituximab therapy. CONCLUSION: Lower dose rituximab by adding fresh frozen plasma is effective and safe for ITP. Our therapeutic regimen is superior to other relative studies; however, a randomized control trial is needed to confirm the results of our study. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
