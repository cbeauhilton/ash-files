    "abstract_text": "Background Rituximab (R) maintenance therapy bimonthly until progression has been shown in a recent randomized study to prolong duration of remission (with median follow-up of 37 months) and overall survival in elderly patients (pts) with MCL after R-CHOP, but not after R-FC, induction therapy (Kluin-Nelemans et al, N Engl J Med 2012; 367:520-31). We have previously reported initial results of 60 elderly pts with MCL treated with induction therapy consisting of 10 cycles of alternating standard CHOP and intermediate-dose AraC (combining fludarabine in 3 cycles) with 8 doses of R, followed by bimonthly R maintenance for 2 years (yrs) (R\u00e4ty et al. Leuk Lymphoma 2012; 53:1920-8). High response rate to induction therapy with ORR of 95% (CR/CRu 87%) was seen. PFS was 70% and OS 72% at 4 yrs with the median follow-up of 40 months. Herein, we update our results of this prospective study with completed maintenance therapy in all pts with a median follow-up time of 6 yrs for surviving pts. Methods The pts were recruited at 10 Finnish centres during Dec 2004 and Aug 2010. Eligible pts were > 65 yrs old with histologically confirmed newly diagnosed (WHO criteria, CD5+, CD19/20+, Cyclin D1+) and previously untreated stage II-IV MCL with adequate organ functions and performance status (WHO) <4. Induction: standard dose R-CHOP (cycles 1, 3, 5), R-AraC (R 375 mg/m 2 x1, AraC 1 g/ m 2 4 doses with 12 hrs intervals; cycles 2, 4), R-AraC with fludarabine (F) (F 25 mg/m 2 2 doses, cycles 6-8), CHOP (cycles 9, 10). Maintenance for pts in CR/PR: R 375 mg/m 2 bimonthly x 12. Response was evaluated according to Cheson\u2019s criteria after 5 th , 8 th and 10 th cycle, every 6 months during maintenance and 1 year follow-up, and clinically for later follow-up every 6 months. Median follow-up time at the time of this analysis was 70 months (range 41 \u2013 113 months) for living pts. Results At the time of diagnosis the median age of 60 recruited pts was 74 yrs (range 65-83), 62% were males, 97% had advanced disease (stage III-IV), 77% had good performance status (PS 0-1). Most (87%) had a history of some other notable illness, most typically cardiovascular disease. Another cancer had been diagnosed earlier in 9 pts (prostate n=3, breast n=3, other n=3). The MIPI risk was low in 2%, intermediate in 45% and high in 53% of the pts, respectively. ORR was 95% (CR/CRu n= 52, PR n=5, PD n=2). One patient could not be evaluated for response due to withdrawal of consent after the first cycle. Seven pts did not receive R maintenance (died/progressed/relapsed during induction n=5, withdrawal of consents n= 2). All 12 doses were given to 34 of 53 pts (64%, CR/CRu n=32, PR n=2). Four pts discontinued maintenance due to recurrent infections / neutropenia,10 pts due to relapse and 5 due to other reasons (secondary MDS n=1, general fatigue n=2, unknown n=2). A transient grade 4 neutropenia was seen in 20 pts during maintenance with no serious infections. HZV or VZV infections were recorded in 9 pts. Altogether 22 of responding pts have progressed/relapsed (during induction n=2, during maintenance n=10, during follow-up n=10), 6 of them with isolated CNS relapse. Twenty-one pts have died (sudden cardiac death during induction n=1, progressive MCL n=17, secondary MDS/AML n=1, unknown n=2). At 6 yrs (intention to treat) PFS was 64% (median 97 months, 95% CI 75 \u2013 120 months), EFS 59% (median 95 months, 95% CI 75 \u2013 114 months) and OS 62% (median not reached), respectively. DFS was 72% at 6 yrs (median 91 months, 95% CI 89 \u2013 93 months) for 52 pts in CR/CRu. Two pts have developed secondary MDS (at 27 and 67 months). Eight new cancers (prostate n=3, breast n=1 and skin n=4) have been recorded in 6 patients during maintenance or follow-up. Conclusions Long PFS and OS over 60% at 6 yrs with median DFS of more than 7 yrs can be achieved with prolonged cytarabine-containing immunochemotherapy followed by 2 yrs R maintenance in elderly pts with MCL. Maintenance therapy was well tolerated in general. Transient neutropenia during maintenance was not uncommon, but serious infections were not seen and only 4 pts discontinued maintenance therapy because of recurrent neutropenia or infections. Attention for second malignancies is requested as 9 pts had cancer before MCL diagnosis, MDS/AML was developed in 2 pts and 6 pts showed carcinomas during follow-up in this elderly patient population.
