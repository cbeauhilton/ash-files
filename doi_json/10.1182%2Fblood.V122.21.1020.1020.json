    "abstract_text": "Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), caused by mutation of the adult \u03b2-globin gene, are phenotypically normal if they carry compensatory mutations that result in continued expression of the fetal \u03b3-globin genes, a condition termed hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Thus, a logical clinical goal for treatment of SCD is to up-regulate \u03b3-globin synthesis using compounds that are specific for increasing fetal hemoglobin (HbF) without pleiotropic effects on cellular homeostasis. Developmental regulation of the \u03b3-globin genes is complex and normal silencing during the adult stage of erythropoiesis likely results from a combination of the loss of transcriptional activators and the gain of transcriptional repressor complexes. One mode of \u03b3-globin silencing occurs at the GATA binding sites located at -566 or -567 relative to the A \u03b3-globin or G \u03b3-globin CAP sites respectively, and is mediated through the DNA binding moiety of GATA-1 and its recruitment of co-repressor partners, FOG-1 and Mi-2 (NuRD complex). Modifications of repressor complexes can regulate gene transcription; one such modification is O-GlcNAcylation. The O-GlcNAc post-translational modification is the attachment of a single N-acetyl-glucosamine moiety to either a serine or threonine residue on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. O-GlcNAc is added to proteins by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and removed by O-GlcNAcase (OGA) in response to changes in extracellular signals and nutrients. A dynamic balance in protein levels also exists between these two enzymes; an increase or decrease of one results in a like compensatory change in the other. Thus, the rate of O-GlcNAc addition and removal is a dynamic cycling event that is exquisitely controlled for a given target molecule, which may offer a point of intervention in the turning off or on of gene expression. O-GlcNAcylation is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes such as stress response, cell cycle progression, and transcription. Potentially, O-GlcNAc plays a pivotal role in regulating transcription of the human \u03b3-globin genes. We induced human erythroleukemia cell line K562 with sodium butyrate to differentiate toward the erythroid lineage and observed the expected increase of \u03b3-globin gene expression. A robust increase of \u03b3-globin gene expression was measured after pharmacological inhibition of OGA using Thiamet-G (TMG). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we demonstrated that OGT and OGA are recruited to the -566 region of the A \u03b3-globin promoter, the same region occupied by the GATA-1-FOG-1-Mi-2 (NuRD) repressor complex. However, OGT recruitment to this region was decreased when O-GlcNAc levels were artificially elevated by OGA inhibition with TMG. When \u03b3-globin expression was not induced, Mi-2 was modified with O-GlcNAc and interacted with both OGT and OGA. After induction, O-GlcNAcylation of Mi-2 was reduced and Mi2 no longer interacted with OGT. Stable K562 cells were generated in which OGA was knocked down using shRNA. Following induction of these cells with sodium butyrate, \u03b3-globin gene expression was higher compared to control cells. These data suggest that the dynamic cycling of O-GlcNAc on the Mi-2 (NuRD) moiety contributes towards regulation of \u03b3-globin transcription. Concurrent ChIP experiments in human \u03b2-globin locus yeast artificial chromosome (\u03b2-YAC) transgenic mice demonstrated that GATA-1, Mi2 and OGT were recruited to the -566 A \u03b3-globin GATA silencer site in day E18 fetal liver when \u03b3-globin is repressed, but not in day E12 fetal liver when \u03b3-globin is expressed. These data demonstrate that O-GlcNAc cycling is a novel mechanism regulating \u03b3-globin gene expression and will provide new avenues to explore in how alterations in gene regulation lead to the onset, progression, and severity of hematological disease.
