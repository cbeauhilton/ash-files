    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4951 Background Primary Plasma Cell Leukemia (PPCL) is an aggressive, rare variant of multiple myeloma, with clinical, molecular and phenotypic peculiarities, which accounts approximately for 2% to 4% of all myeloma diagnoses. The prognosis of PPCL patients is usually poor, with less than half of patients responding to conventional chemotherapy and a median survival of 7 months. Even by using autologous or allogeneic transplant procedures, survival generally does not exceed three years. Bortezomib has recently provided some promising results in this setting, but, given all the above, new treatments for PPCL are greatly awaited. Lenalidomide is a new immunomodulating agent with great efficacy in multiple myeloma, especially when associated with dexamethasone or other drugs. There are, indeed, some sporadic case reports of PPCL patients treated with lenalidomide as salvage therapy, but no data are currently available on the use of this drug as first line therapy in this disease. Patients and Methods On March, 2009, we started an open label, prospective, multicenter, exploratory, single arm, two-stage study aiming to evaluate safety and antitumor activity of the lenalidomide/low dose dexamethasone combination (Rd), as first line therapy in patients with PPCL. The primary endpoint was early response rate according to International Uniform Criteria. The secondary endpoints were TTP, PFS, OS, percentage of eligible PPCL patients able to collect peripheral blood stem cells and to undergo autologous or allogeneic stem cells transplantation after Rd, serious and severe adverse event rate. According to this study protocol, all eligible, newly diagnosed adult patients with PPCL receive Lenalidomide at a dose of 25 mg daily for 21 days every 28 days. Oral dexamethasone is administered at a dose of 40 mg daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for each 28-day cycle. After 4 cycles, patients who achieve at least PR and not eligible for autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, continue with Rd until clinically appropriate (disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient's decision to leave the protocol). In these patients, a maintenance dose of lenalidomide alone equal to 10 mg/die days 1-21 every month is considered after at least 8 full dose Rd cycles. Patients responding after 4 Rd cycles and eligible for transplant procedures, proceed according to single Centre transplant policy. Patients not responding after 4 cycles or progressing under Rd treatment are considered off-study. Appropriate contraception methods and anti-thrombotic prophylaxis are planned. Results Four enrolled patients (1 male, 3 female, mean age 65 years, range 58-69) are currently evaluable for early response. All had unfavourable cytogenetics, including del13, t(4;14), t (14;16), or a complex karyotype. Circulating plasma cells ranged from 4.4 to 9.2 \u00d710e9/l. One patient had at baseline a moderate degree of renal failure (serum creatinine levels 2 mg/dl). After at least 2 Rd cycles (range 2-4), two PR and two VGPR were achieved (overall response rate 100%), with disappearance or near complete reduction of circulating plasma cells in all cases. The most relevant toxicities were grade 3 neutropenia and pneumonia, occurring in one patient and resolved by appropriate lenalidomide dose reduction, introduction of G-CSF and antibiotic therapy. One patient died in PR, due to causes unrelated to PPCL or treatment. As, according to the Simon, two-stage design adopted, more than two responses occurred within the first ten patients enrolled (stage 1), a total of 22 PPCL subjects will be accrued to complete the stage 2 of the trial. Conclusions These findings, though very preliminary, suggest that the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone may be a safe and promising initial therapy for PPCL patients, which can rapidly control the disease and could permit to perform following single patient-adapted therapeutic strategies. An update of this study, including molecular data, a larger number of patients and a longer follow-up, will be presented at the Meeting.
