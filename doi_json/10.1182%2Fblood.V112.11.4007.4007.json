    "abstract_text": "Background: The results of salvage chemotherapy for patient with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia(AML) have been generally disappointing with low response rates and occasional long-term survivors in most studies. Since therapeutic failure seems to be inevitable in the great majority of these patients, development of more effective salvage therapy is warranted. Recent approaches to the treatment of previously treated AML generally involved the use of cytarabine in intermediate or high-dose alone or in association with new intercalating agents, such as amsacrine, mitoxantrone or idarubicin, etoposide, or asparaginase. Methods: A single course of mitoxantrone 6 mg/m 2 intravenous (IV) bolus, etoposide 80 mg/m 2 IV for 1 hour, and cytarabine (Ara-C) 1g/m 2 IV for 6 hours daily for 6 days (MEC), has been proposed as a salvage regimen. Between October 1998 and May 2005, thirty refractory/relapsed AML patients have been treated by MEC salvage chemotherapy. Twenty two patients were in relapse and eight patients were refractory after conventional induction chemotherapy including cytarabine and idarubicin or mitoxantrone. Two patient were in relapse after allogenous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(SCT). Results: Complete remission(CR) was obtained in 12 of 30 patients(40%) and 3 of 30(10%) died during salvage treatment: 2 due to intracranial hemorrhage and 1 due to fungemia sepsis. After CR achievement, 5 patients received consolidation chemotherapy. Two patients with an HLA-identical sibling donor underwent allogeneic SCT, and one patient received autologous SCT. Severe myelosuppression was observed in all patients resulting in fever or documented infections in 90% of patients. Nonhematologic toxicity was minimal. At the time of analysis, 9 of 11 patients who achieved CR have relapsed. Median disease-free survival was 12 months. Median overall survival was 13.5 months. There were only two longterm remitters. Several clinicolaboratory and treatment-related variables were analyzed to determine their prognostic significance for CR achievement, duration of CR, overall survival. Conclusions: Our results suggest that MEC combination chemotherapy might induce CR in a patient with refractory or relapsed AML, although new agents or new therapeutic strategies should be required for long term remission.",
