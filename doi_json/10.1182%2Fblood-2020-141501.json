    "abstract_text": "Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired hemolytic disorder of the multipotent myeloid stem cells, due to underexpression of surface complement inhibitory proteins CD55 and CD59, affecting 0.13/100,000 patients per year. Besides anemia and thrombosis, PNH can also cause smooth muscle dystonias owing to various mechanisms in the body. Studies have described smooth muscle dystonias presenting as recurrent abdominal pain, lethargy and erectile dysfunction, but intermittent dysphagia is rare with PNH. We describe a case of dysphagia with negative work up as initial presentation of PNH. 16-year-old female with no significant past medical history presented to the clinic with 1 week of ongoing fatigue and difficulty swallowing. She never had any similar complaints in the past nor in her family. The dysphagia was progressively worsening, initially for solid, then with liquids, accompanied by nausea, vomiting and globus sensation in the middle chest. No prior psychiatric history, binging-purging behavior, chest pain, shortness of breath, heat/cold intolerance, weight changes, bladder or bowel dysfunction. She also denied any recent travels, allergies, transfusions, sick contacts, or over-the-counter medication use. Initial labwork showed Hb 11.2 g/dL, MCV 80 fL, WBC 9 x10 3 K/uL, and platelet 219,000 K/uL. Metabolic panel, troponin, BNP, ANA, rheumatoid factor, lyme serology, vitamin B12, folate and iron studies were within normal limits. Mentzer index <13, serum protein electrophoresis ruled out Thalassemia. LDH was elevated and Haptoglobin decreased. Direct and indirect Coomb's antibody test were negative. Peripheral smear showed normocytic normochromic anemia with normal morphology of RBCs. Flow cytometry showed lack of CD55 and CD59. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, done for dysphagia, to rule out luminal obstruction was unremarkable. CT chest with contrast ruled out external compression on esophagus. Videofluoroscopic swallow study revealed segmental, dynamic obstruction to both solids and liquids in the lower third of the esophagus. Dysphagia was attributed to PNH and patient was started on eculizumab. She responded to the medication in 3 weeks, during which outpatient symptomatic therapy was given for her anemia along with soft semisolid diet. In PNH, the RBCs may have varying degree of CD59 and glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor protein deficiency, with unaffected cells described as type I, partially affected cells called type II, and complete lack of the proteins deemed type III red cells. PNH red cell type III and type II red cells are 15 to 25 times and 3 to 5 times more sensitive to complement-mediated lysis than the type I normal red cells. This variability in the severity of the deficiency, as well as in the proportion of the cell population affected, defines the extent of the clinical manifestations of the disease. Approximately 40% of patients have a combination of types I, II and III PNH cells With hemolysis, after exceeding haptoglobin's binding capacity, the free hemoglobin binds any available nitrous oxide (NO) in the blood. Hemolysis also reduces endogenous NO generation by conversion of l\u2010arginine, which is a component in NO generation, to ornithine, thereby further reducing the systemic availability of NO. NO is endogenous smooth muscle relaxor via activation of cGMP. Decreases in NO levels are hypothesized to cause smooth muscle contraction, manifesting as abdominal pain, erectile dysfunction and rarely, dysphagia in the lower two-third of the esophagus which is predominantly smooth muscle. These symptoms occur more commonly in patients with large PNH clone sizes and, therefore, higher hemolytic rates. In this case study, our focus was to recognize PNH among differentials for new onset dysphagia due to complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis causing gastrointestinal dysmotility. In doing so, invasive investigations may be avoided. Advance studies may be needed to completely understand the causes and correlate between PNH, intravascular hemolysis and dysphagia.
