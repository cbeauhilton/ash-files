    "abstract_text": "Background Acute renal failure or injury is a common complication of treatment of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or high risk MDS, but the effect of renal function of patients who have acute myeloid leukemia/high risk MDS is not clearly highlighted as a predictor of survival, to the best of our knowledge this issue has not been studied in depth before. Aim study the effect of chronic kidney disease on the survival of patient with acute myeloid leukemia/High Risk MDS. Methods A retrospective study of all AML & high risk MDS patients treated at AGMC, Ohio, USA during 2001-2010. After IRB approval of the project, patients\u2019 charts were reviewed to gather information on demographics, diagnosis types/subtypes, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), treatment, and cytogenetics. Patients were classified as low-intermediate risk or high risk according to cytogenetic background using WHO criteria. Also according to GFR patients were classified to GFR  60. Overall survival (OS) rates were determined by Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis. Prognostic factors were evaluated by Log Rank analysis. Result Out of 130 patients we were able to classify 99 patients (75%). Patient were grouped into 59 Pts with GFR>60, 37 Pts with GFR 30-60 and 3 Pts with GFR<30. Time to event survival analysis was done. Table 1. Summary  Group . Number failed . Number censored . Mean .
