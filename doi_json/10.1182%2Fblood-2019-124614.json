    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia (WM) is a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in which bone marrow is infiltrated by immunoglobulin M (IgM)-producing clonal lymphoplasmacytic cells. Tirabrutinib (ONO/GS-4059) is a second-generation Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor with greater selectivity than ibrutinib. We performed a prospective, multicenter phase 2 study of tirabrutinib in patients with treatment-na\u00efve (TN) or relapsed/refractory (R/R) WM. METHODS Patients with TN or R/R WM, serum IgM \u2265500 mg/dL, ECOG performance status \u22651, and normal end-organ function were treated with tirabrutinib 480 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was major response rate (MRR, \u2265 partial response [PR]) assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) according to the criteria of the VIth International Workshop on Waldenstr\u00f6m Macroglobulinemia (IWWM) (Owen RG et al. Br J Haematol . 2013). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR, \u2265 minor response [MR]), time to major response (TTMR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS Twenty seven patients (18 TN and 9 R/R) were treated as of July 3, 2019, and the median follow-up duration was 6 months. The median age of patients was 71 years (range 50-83), and 20 patients (74.1%) had ECOG performance status 0. Median serum IgM was 3600 mg/dL (range 730-6930). Median number of prior therapies among R/R patients was 2 (range 1-7), and 8 patients had received prior rituximab monotherapy or rituximab-containing chemotherapy. IRC-assessed MRR was 77.8% (95%CI: 52.4-93.6) in TN and 88.9% (95%CI: 51.8-99.7) in R/R. IRC-assessed ORR was 94.4% (95%CI: 72.7-99.9) in TN and 100% (95%CI: 66.4-100.0) in R/R. Median TTMR was 1.9 months (range 1.0-5.7) in TN and 2.1 months (range 1.0-3.7) in R/R. Median DOR, PFS, and OS were not reached. The most common adverse events (AEs) at any grade were rash (41%), neutropenia (22%), and leukopenia (15%), of which most were grade 1 or 2. Grade \u22653 AEs were neutropenia (7.4%), leukopenia, lymphopenia, atypical mycobacterial infection, rash erythematous, and erythema multiforme (3.7% each); there was no grade 4 or 5 AE. There were 4 bleeding events and all events were grade 1: mouth hemorrhage, petechiae, anal hemorrhage, and hematoma (3.7% each). Rash-related events occurred in 56% of patients and 2 events were grade 3: erythema multiforme and rash erythematous (3.7% each) which were manageable. CONCLUSION Although the follow-up time was relatively short, the results of this phase 2 study showed that tirabrutinib monotherapy is a highly effective treatment option for patients with TN and R/R WM, with a manageable safety profile.
