    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1959 Background: Kinesin Spindle Protein (KSP) is required for cell cycle progression through mitosis. Inhibition of KSP induces mitotic arrest and cell death. ARRY-520 is a potent, selective KSP inhibitor. Cancers such as multiple myeloma (MM) which depend on the short-lived survival protein MCL-1 are highly sensitive to treatment with ARRY-520. ARRY-520 shows potent activity in preclinical MM models, providing a strong rationale for its clinical investigation in this disease. Methods: This Phase 1 study was designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ARRY-520 administered intravenously (IV) on Day 1 and Day 2 q 2 weeks without/with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (RR) MM with 2 prior lines of therapy (including both bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent, unless ineligible for or refusing to receive this therapy) were eligible. Cohorts of at least 3 pts were enrolled in a classical 3 + 3 dose escalation design. Pts were treated for 2 cycles (4 weeks) to evaluate safety prior to dose escalation. Results: Twenty five pts have been treated to date, with a median age of 60 years (range 44\u201379) and a median of 5 prior regimens (range 2\u201316). All pts received prior bortezomib or carfilzomib, 21 pts received prior lenalidomide, 17 pts prior thalidomide, and 18 pts had a prior stem cell transplant. Pts received ARRY-520 without G-CSF at 1 mg/m 2 /day (n = 3), and at 1.25 mg/m 2 /day (n = 7, 6 evaluable). A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of Grade 4 neutropenia was observed at 1.25 mg/m 2 /day, and this was considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) without G-CSF. As neutropenia was the DLT, dose escalation with prophylactic G-CSF support was initiated, at doses of 1.5 mg/m 2 /day (n = 7, 6 evaluable), 2.0 mg/m 2 /day (n = 6) and 2.25 mg/m 2 /day (n = 2) with G-CSF. Both the 2.0 mg/m 2 /day and 2.25 mg/m 2 /day dose levels were determined to be non-tolerated, with DLTs of febrile neutropenia (FN) (2 pts at 2.0 mg/m 2 /day and both pts at 2.25 mg/m 2 /day) and Grade 3 mucositis (both pts at 2.25 mg/m 2 /day). One out of 6 evaluable pts at 1.5 mg/m 2 /day also developed a DLT of FN. In an attempt to optimize the Phase 2 dose, an intermediate dose level of 1.75 mg/m 2 /day with G-CSF is currently being evaluated. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events (AEs) include those observed with other KSP inhibitors, such as hematological AEs (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, leukopenia), fatigue, mucositis and other gastro-intestinal AEs. Pts displayed linear PK, a low clearance and a moderate volume of distribution, with moderate-to-high inter-individual variability in PK parameters. The median terminal elimination half life is 65 hours. The preliminary efficacy signal as a single agent is encouraging with 2 partial responses (PR) observed to date per IMWG and EBMT criteria in a heavily pretreated population (23 evaluable pts). A bortezomib-refractory pt with 8 prior lines of therapy, including a tandem transplant, treated at 1 mg/m 2 /day of ARRY-520 obtained a PR after Cycle 6, with urine protein and kappa light chain levels continuing to decline over time. He remains on-study after 15 months of ARRY-520 treatment. A pt with 2 prior lines of therapy, including prior carfilzomib, has obtained a PR after Cycle 8 at 2 mg/m 2 /day of ARRY-520, and she is currently ongoing after 4.5 months on therapy. Fifteen pts had a best response of stable disease (SD), including 1 pt with a thus far unconfirmed minimal response, and 6 had progressive disease. A total of 10 pts (43%) achieved a PR or SD lasting > 12 weeks. Several additional pts have shown other evidence of clinical activity, with decrease in paraproteins, increase in hemoglobin levels and regression of plasmacytomas. The median number of cycles is 4 (range 1\u201328+). Treatment activity has not correlated with any baseline characteristics or disease parameters to date. Conclusions: : The selective KSP inhibitor ARRY-520 has been well tolerated, and shows promising signs of single agent clinical activity in heavily pretreated pts with RR MM. Prophylactic G-CSF has enabled higher doses to be tolerated. No cardiovascular or liver enzyme toxicity has been reported. Enrollment is ongoing at 1.75 mg/m 2 /day with G-CSF support, and a planned Phase 2 part of the study will be initiated as soon as the MTD is determined. Complete Phase 1 data will be disclosed at the time of the meeting.
