    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3413 Introduction Imatinib mesylate is highly effective in inducing rapid hematologic and cytogenetic responses in the vast majority of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Yet, discontinuation of treatment is associated with disease relapse probably due to the persistence of resistant leukemic stem cells representing a reservoir of the disease. On this regard it has been reported that BCR-ABL positive progenitor cells can still be detected in patients in complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) after short term of imatinib treatment ( Bhatia R, et al. Blood. 2003;101:4701-4707 ) but also after a stable long lasting CCyR ( Bocchia M, et al. Leukemia. 2008;22:426-428 ). Compared to imatinib, the second generation Tyrosin Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) nilotinib appears to eradicate more rapidly the bulk of CML cells, inducing high rate of CCyR and major molecular response (MMolR) after a very short period of treatment (78% CCyR and 52% MMolR at 3 months) ( Rosti G, et al. Blood. 2009;114(24):4933-8 ). Despite nilotinib is a more potent TKI, it didn't appear to be more effective in eliminating in vitro CML progenitors than imatinib ( Konig H, et al Leukemia. 2008;22:748-755 ). Up to date no data evaluating the persistence of Ph+ stem cells in early chronic phase CML patients during first line treatment with nilotinib have been reported. Patients, materials and methods We investigated the presence of residual CD34+/Ph+ cells in 24 CML patients in CCyR during first line nilotinib treatment. Patients were enrolled in 2 clinical trials (GIMEMA CML0307 and CAMN107A2303) and evaluation of residual leukemic stem cells was performed during a routine bone marrow aspirate after receiving specific patients informed consent. Bone marrow purified CD34+ cells were evaluated for BCR-ABL fusion gene by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. A minimum of 100 interphase nuclei of purified CD34+ cells was considered optimal for FISH analysis. Results All 24 patients have been treated exclusively with nilotinib since diagnosis (17/24 at 400mg bid; 5/24 at 300mg bid; 2/24 at 400mg/day). At the time of analysis all 24 patients were in CCyR for a median time of 27 months (range 6\u201329) after being treated for a median time of 30 months (range 9\u201330) with this second generation TKI. Regarding molecular response 20/24 (83%) were in MMolR while only 1/24 (4%) was in CMolR. Harvest, purification and subsequent FISH analysis of bone marrow CD34+ cells was optimal in 15/24 (63%) patients, suboptimal in 5/24 (21%) patients (less than 100 interphase nuclei analyzed) and not adequate in 4/24 (16%) patients (less than 50 interphase nuclei). With respect to leukemic stem cells, residual CD34+/Ph+ cells were found only in 1/20 (5%) evaluable patients. Of note, in this patient 140 CD34+ interphase nuclei were analyzed and only 1 was found bcr-abl positive (0.7%). Conclusion Our study shows for the first time that in patients in CCyR during front line Nilotinib treatment residual CD34+/Ph+ stem cells are very rarely detected. These results quite differ from what was previously found in imatinib treated patients ( Bocchia M, et al. Leukemia. 2008;22:426-428 ). In fact in the present series, only 1/20 (5%) patients treated with nilotinib in CCyR for a median time of 27 months showed residual CD34+/Ph+ cells, while in our prior study residual leukemic CD34+ cells were still detectable in 14/31 (45%) imatinib treated patients in stable CCyR (median of 39 months). Despite the limited number of patients studied, this novel evidence may support the better short term clinical results observed with nilotinib as first line treatment in CML.
