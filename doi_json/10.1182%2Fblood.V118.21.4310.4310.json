The aim of this study is to assess the anti-myeloma effect of lenalidomide followed by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) as adoptive immunotherapy after transplantation. Patients and methods: Twelve patients with refractory and high risk myeloma were analyzed. Median age at transplantation was 56 years (46\u201364); 6 patients (50%) received lenalidomide before Allo-SCT. All patients received a RIC including Fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 5 days, ATG 2,5 mg/kg for 2 days and Busilvex 3.2 mg/kg/day (3 days in 6 patients and 2 days in 6 patients). All but one received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). Donor was HLA id in 6 patients and matched unrelated in 6 patients. It is our standard long term practice to consider post-transplant DLI in patients with progressive or persistent disease after day 100 if no GVHD signs were evident. In 2010, we introduced the use of lenalidomide after day 100 in patients with MM presenting the same characteristics. Doses ranged from 10 to 25 mg/day. Lenalodomide treatment could be completed with DLI, administered afterward, at least after 2 cycles. Results: The median time between Allo-SCT and lenalidomide was 10 months (3\u201338). The median initial dose of lenalidomide was 15 mg (10\u201325). Patients received a median of 6 cycles (1\u201310). Nine patients (60%) received an escalating dose of DLI; 1 \u00d7 10 7 /Kg of CD3 + cells for the first DLI and 1 \u00d7 10 8 /Kg of CD3 + cells for the second DLI. One patient with GVHD (after tapering of the cyclosporine A and only after 10 days of lenalidomide) and two patients with progressive disease after lenalidomide did not receive DLI. The toxicity related to lenalidomide was mainly haematological (grade II in 4 patients (33%) and grade I in 3 patients (25%); 7 patients (58%) had moderate asthenia. One patient developed a reversible renal insufficiency after 10 cycles of lenalidomide, none of our patients developed thrombo-embolism under treatment. At the last follow up, 9 patients are alive and all of them are under ongoing treatment. Four patients achieved complete remission (CR) and five patients partial remission at last evaluation. The 1 and 2 years probability of the progression-free survival (PFS) was 75% and 50% and overall survival (OS) was 83 % and 69% respectively. The median OS was not reached and the median PFS was 23 months. Conclusions: These data show that lenalidomide has an acceptable toxicity. Combination with DLI should be further evaluated in a larger cohort of patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
