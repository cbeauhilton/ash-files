    "abstract_text": "Murine bone marrow (BM) contains a mobile population of CXCR4 + SSEA-1 + Sca-1 + lin \u2212 CD45 \u2212 very small embryonic like (VSEL) stem cells ( Leukemia  2006 : 20 ; 857 ) that are mobilized into peripheral blood (PB) in SDF-1 dependent manner e.g., after pharmacological mobilization with G-CSF or in murine model of stroke ( Leukemia  2006 : 20 ; 18 ). We proposed that VSEL could be potentially employed in regeneration of damaged brain or spinal cord. Since a similar population of CXCR4 + CD133 + CD34 + SSEA-4 + Oct-4 + lin \u2212 CD45 \u2212 cells resides also in human BM ( Leukemia  2007 : 21 ; 297 ), we asked whether in humans, similarly as in mice, the stroke-related stress may trigger mobilization of these cells from BM into PB. To address this question, we evaluated a number of VSEL in 60 stroke patients and similar number of age-matched controls. The PB samples were harvested during first 24 h, day +3 and day + 7 after stroke, and compared to normal controls. The circulating VSEL in PB were evaluated by employing RQ-PCR, FACS and direct immunofluorescence analysis. To perform these studies, first the mRNA was extracted from circulating PB mononuclear cells (MNC) and the expression of pluripotent (e.g., Oct-4, Nanog) and neural specific markers (GFAP, Nestin, \u03b2-III-tubulin, Olig1, Olig) was evaluated by RQ-PCR. Next, the circulating PB MNC were analyzed by FACS for the presence of cells that express CXCR4 +, CD133 + and CD34 + antigens. Finally, we measured the serum concentration of SDF-1 by ELISA. We found in stroke patients an increase in total number of circulating CXCR4 + D133 + CD34 + cells, \u223c \u00d7 8 increase in expression of mRNA for Oct-4 and Nanog in circulating PB MNC that was subsequently confirmed by immunofluorescence staining for a presence of CXCR4 + Oct-4 + cells, and increase in serum concentration of SDF-1. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the extensiveness of a stroke and the number of CXCR4 + VSEL circulating in PB. We conclude that the stroke triggers the mobilization of CXCR4 + VSEL. We hypothesize that these cells could have a prognostic value in stroke patients as well as use for regeneration of neural tissues. Currently, we are testing this hypothesis in the murine model of stroke.",
