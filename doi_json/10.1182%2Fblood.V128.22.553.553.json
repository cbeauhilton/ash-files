    "abstract_text": "Blood glycoprotein von Willebrand Factor (VWF) is constantly circulating in the blood vessel, with its platelet GPIb-IX recognizing unit-the A1 domain-being masked to avoid its adventitious binding and activating platelets. This \"self-mask\" mechanism, however, remains poorly understood. The impediment in identifying the self-mask ligand is to have the right pair of VWF fragments with opposite binding behavior for comparison. Here we characterize using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spec a pair of VWF fragments containing the A1 domain with opposite association to platelets. The results suggest that the short N-terminal region (1238-1260) in front of the A1 domain might involve in protecting the VWF A1 domain by masking a critical region near the binding site for GPIb. We expressed and purified using baby hamster kidney cells two C-terminally His-tagged proteins: both contain the entire A1 domain (1273-1453), with one has more extra N-terminal residues (1238-1472, named l A1) than the other (1261-1472, named s A1). Both proteins seem to be glycosylated and stable without obvious deformation for over one week when stored at 4\u00b0C. The analytical ultracentrifugation analysis determined that both proteins are primarily in the monomeric form: the sedimentation coefficient (S) and the derived apparent molecular weight for l A1 are 2.50 S and 36.6 kDa, and those for s A1 are 1.37 S and 27.4 kDa. Interaction of l A1 and s A1 to GPIb, as determined by flow cytometry, is surprisingly opposite: only s A1, but not l A1, efficiently binds washed platelets at the concentration similar to the physiological concentration of vWF in the blood vessel. Increasing l A1 concentration 10 times did not improve its binding. Replacing the platelets with CHO cells that express human GPIb-IX complex exhibited similar result. Implied in these results are that either l A1 adopt a different conformation that disadvantages its binding or the binding site on A1 is masked by the extra amino acids in l A1 compared to s A1. Protein hydrogen-deuterium exchange is a sensitive assay to determine the local conformational change and the existence of the masked region. We acquired hydrogen-deuterium exchange data for both proteins and got nearly 100% sequences coverage from over 150 overlaid peptides for each protein, with on average over 10 redundancy per residue, which allows us to compare the hydrogen-deuterium exchange rate/extent of the A1 domain in l A1 and s A1 in good resolution. The results show that the global hydrogen-deuterium exchange pattern is the same between the two, indicating that the tertiary structures of the two proteins are similar. However, a contiguous region in l A1 is clearly protected from hydrogen-deuterium exchange compared to that in s A1 (indicated by the colorful region in figure 1). The protected region is located at the bottom of the globular A1 domain, including three loop regions (1272-1276; 1304-1310; and 1332-1340) and a part of the a1 helix (1289-1300). Compared to s A1, in this protected region of l A1 the deuterium exchange extents are reduced by 20-60% even after 3-hour incubation. Furthermore, 11 of out of 15 identified \"gain-of-function\" mutation sites of type 2B VWD are located in this masked region (P1266, H1268, C1272, M1304, R1306, R1308, I1309, S1310, W1313, P1337, R1341); the other 4 are located adjacently (V1314, V1316, L1460, A1461). This good alignment implies that the \"gain-of-function\" might associate with the detachment of the identified masking ligand in this region. Based on our findings, we propose that this short region in front of the A1 domain may involve in masking the A1 domain from interacting with platelet GPIb-IX. If confirmed, this internal masking ligand might offer new clues on how the mutations on A1 domain affect its role -as \"gain-of-function\" in type 2B VWD and \"loss-of-function\" in type 2M VWD.
