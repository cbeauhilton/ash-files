    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5024 Background The DNA-targeted hypomethylating agent, decitabine, has made a real impact on response rate in Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) patients, and may improve overall survival in high-risk patients. Aim: To describe overall survival by prognosis score in decitabine-treated MDS patients. Methods: From May 2007 to January 2011, MDS patients who received decitabine were followed at centers in Argentina and South Korea. Patients \u226518 years of age with de novo MDS (all WHO Subtypes and CMML type-1 and type-2) were included, provided they had received \u22654 cycles of decitabine (recommended dose, 20 mg/m 2 IV over 1 hour \u00d7 5 days every 4 weeks) and had stable disease or better by IWG 2006 criteria. Median life expectancy was determined according different categories of the MD Anderson and International Prognostic Scoring Systems (MDAPSS and IPSS). Decitabine treatment was effective when the patient outlived the median life expectancy. Results: Sixty-one patients received \u22654 cycles of decitabine and had stable disease or better. Median age was 61 years and 69% were male. All patients had de novo MDS with ECOG \u22642. Median time from MDS diagnosis was 24 months. Baseline WHO classification was: RA (0%); RARS (2%); RCMD (18%); RCMDRS (3%); RAEB-1 (13%); RAEB-2 (30%); MDS/MPD (2%); AML/MDS (5%); CMML type-1 (21%); and CMML type-2 (6%). Forty one percent had comorbidities. Patients received a median of 8 cycles of decitabine (range, 4\u201318). Forty four percent died during the study and 31% progressed to AML. Median overall survival was higher than life expectancy among patients with high-risk MDS by MDAPSS (Kantarjian H. et al. Cancer 2008; 113: 1351) and by IPSS (Greenberg P. et al. Blood 1997; 89: 2079). Survival exceeded life expectancy for 90%, 100%, and 86% of patients with MDAPSS 7\u20138, MDAPSS \u22659, and IPSS Int-2 + High, respectively. Conclusion: High-risk MDS patients who received \u22654 cycles of decitabine and had stable disease or better showed improvement in survival compared with predicted life expectancy published in literature.  .
