    "abstract_text": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most frequent lymphoproliferative disease is characterized by the insidious accumulation of mature-appearing lymphocytes predominantely in bone marrow, blood and lymphatic tissues. Despite a generally indolent course the vast majority of subjects diagnosed with CLL eventually require treatment. Apart from cytostatic drugs recently antibodies have been added to the therapeutic armamentarium. However, only a minority of patients will enjoy long-term disease-free intervals thus making further intervention of therapy highly desirable. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) constitute a new class of epigenetic anti-cancer agents that inhibit growth, induce differentiation and, as recently shown, apoptosis in neoplastic cells. Antitumor acitivity of 1st generation compounds such as SAHA/Zolinza\u2122 is encouraging, yet approval has been limited to treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma so far, a hematologic niche indication. Novel compounds are investigated to assess for more potent antitumor activity, hopefully allowing to broaden the therapeutic spectrum of HDACi. Therefore, we investigated the apoptosis-inducing capacity of JNJ-26481585, a novel \u201csecond generation\u201d hydroxamic acid-based oral pan-HDACi in a CLL cell line and primary, patient-derived CLL cells. In the MEC1 cell line JNJ-26481585 induced apoptosis very effectively within 72hrs at an EC50 of approx. 0,01 \u03bcM. In comparison, SAHA exhibited an EC50 of approx. 3 \u03bcM in the same cell line and the EC50 for Fludarabine is approx. 4 \u03bcM. In primary, patient derived CLL samples [n= 12 pts] the mean EC50 for JNJ-26481585 was 0,005 \u03bcM [range: 0.14 nM to 25 nM; 5 days of incubation] compared to SAHA which had an EC50 of around 7 \u03bcM in primary CLL cells. Strong histone H3 acetylation and HSP70 upregulation was observed as assessed by Western blot, potentially related to HSP90 acetylation. The induction of apoptosis was paralleled by a down-regulation of the bcl-2 protein in western blot. Initial combination therapy explorations showed strong synergism with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade\u2122) shifting the EC50 to the sub nM range both in MEC1 cells as well as in primary CLL samples. In summary, the 2nd generation HDACi JNJ-26481585 induces potent histone acetylation as well as HSP70 upregulation and bcl-2 downregulation in MEC1 cells and primary, patient-derived CLL cells, resulting in an apoptosis-inducing capacity at low nano-molar ranges, far superior to the 1st generation HDACi SAHA/Zolinza\u2122.",
