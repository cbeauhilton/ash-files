    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is associated with an increased hypoxic response from anemia and vaso-occlusion-impaired tissue perfusion. The effects of hypoxia are mediated by hypoxia transcription factors (HIFs). Chuvash erythrocytosis (CE) is an inherited condition due to homozygosity for the missense mutation in VHL gene (VHL R200W ) that impairs interactions of VHL with HIF-\u03b1 subunits, thereby augmenting transcription of HIF-regulated genes. CE and SCA share increased expression of erythropoietin ( EPO ) and other HIF target genes. As HIF-regulation of transcription is tissue and differentiation-stage specific, in this study we used reticulocytes, which are easily accessible and purified peripheral blood erythroid cells. We compared the transcriptomes of SCA and CE reticulocytes to differentiate HIF-mediated dysregulation from non-hypoxic dysregulation of SCA transcripts. Our study revealed reticulocyte gene expression changes that are common to both diseases as well as SCA-specific changes. The reticulocytes were purified from 5 HbSS and 5 age- and gender-matched HbAA African-American individuals, and from 17 VHL R200W homozygotes from Chuvashia and 13 wild type Chuvash individuals. Total RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA and globin transcripts, and reverse transcribed. Strand-specific libraries were constructed for 100 or 125 bp paired-end sequencing to 30-45 million reads using Illumina HiSeq 2500 or 4000 platform. The sequencing data were mapped to human reference genome version GRCh37 using the splice-aware aligner STAR and analyzed using DESeq2. In separate analyses of the two diseases, we identified 1435 genes differentially expressed in SCA among 6965 analyzed genes, 848 increased and 587 decreased in SCA relative to control individuals. We also identified 1498 genes differentially expressed in CE among 8989 analyzed genes, 862 increased and 636 decreased in CE relative to control individuals. Across all analyzed genes, there was a moderate correlation (r=0.30) of expression changes between the two diseases. Among genes differentially expressed, 258 up-regulated and 155 down-regulated genes overlapped between the two diseases, representing a 1.4-fold enrichment. In a combined analysis of the two diseases, we identified 1228 genes among 6924 analyzed genes that shared altered regulation in both diseases. The 693 genes increased in both diseases were enriched (adjusted P < 0.05) in multiple metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative pathways. The 535 genes decreased in both diseases were enriched in a cell cycle pathway. Among the commonly increased genes, the expression level of ERFE encoding erythroferrone was increased by 9.4-fold in CE and by 4.3-fold in SCA, suggesting markedly altered iron regulation in CE and SCA. This would be expected as both SCA and CE share upregulated erythropoiesis that is associated with augmented erythroferrone. Among the commonly decreased genes, RPL3L encoding Ribosomal Protein L3 Like was decreased by 68% in CE and by 93% in SCA. These common expression changes reflect hypoxic regulation related to chronic anemia in SCA. To assess disease-specific gene expression change, we tested the disease (SCA versus CE) by genotype (mutation versus wildtype) interaction effect. We identified 822 genes that showed disease-specific expression changes among 6924 analyzed genes. Of these disease-specific genes, 304 were increased and 153 decreased in SCA (adjusted P 0.05). For example, SLC16A1 , encoding Solute Carrier Family 16 Member 1 and associated with an erythrocyte lactate transporter defect, was increased in SCA by 11-fold whereas PPBP encoding Pro-Platelet Basic Protein was decreased in SCA by 92%; both genes showing no change in CE. The 304 genes with SCA-specific increased expression were enriched in \"Thyroid hormone signaling\" (5.1 fold) and \"Glioma\" (7.0-fold) pathways. The 153 genes with SCA-specific decreased expression were enriched in \"Ribosome\" (12-fold) pathway. Among the disease-specific genes, only 34 increased and 28 decreased in CE but not in SCA. Our study demonstrates high HIF transcriptional activity in both CE and SCA reticulocytes but also reveals hypoxia-independent gene expression changes in SCA reticulocytes. These results suggest that HIF might be a therapeutic target of SCA. These data also shed light on the different molecular mechanisms underlying SCA complications.
