    "abstract_text": "The major limitation of allogeneic stem cell transplantatiopn (SCT) in patients (pts) with myelofibrosis is the high treatment related mortality. We performed a prospective multicenter trial of a dose-reduced conditioning regimen, consisting of busulfan (10 mg/kg orally or 8mg/kg i.v), fludarabine (180 mg/m 2 ) and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG Fresenius: 30\u201360 mg/kg) followed by allogeneic SCT in pts with myelofibrosis. From 2002 to 2006, 104 pts with a median age of 55 years (range: 32\u201368) andlow risk with constitutional symptoms (18%) or intermediate risk (n= 58%) and high risk (n=19%) were included. Cytogenetic abnormalities and JAK2 mutation were noted in 22% and 48%, respectively. Bone marrow histology showed advanced fibrosis (MF 2 and 3) in all pts. All but 3 pts received peripheral blood stem cells as graft source either from related (n=33) or unrelated donor (n=71). All but one (1%) pts showed leukocyte and platelet engraftment after a median of 18 and 21 days, respectively. The median duration of leukocyte aplasia was 9 days (range: 3\u201321). Acute GvHD grade II to IV occurred in 19% and severe aGvHD III/IV in 7%, while chronic GvHD was seen in 32% of the pts. Non-relapse mortality at 1 year was 19% (95% CI: 11\u201327%) and significantly lower for pts younger than 50 years of age (0% vs 27%, p=0.004) and for pts with low risk vs intermediate/high risk disease (0% vs 27%, p= 0.02). The cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years was 29% (95%CI: 15\u201343%). The 3 year overall (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) was 70% (95% CI 60\u201380%) and 55% (95% CI 42\u201368%). Significant factors for improved 3 year OS and EFS were age less than 50 years (92% vs 62%, p=0.003 and 79% vs 46%, p= 0,004) and low vs intermediate/high risk (100% vs 62%, p=0.01 and 72% vs 48%, p= 0.02), while no impact on survival was seen for cytogenetic abnormalities, JAK2 mutation status and donor (related vs unrelated). These prospective multicenter study show excellent outcome of an busulafan/fludarabine based reduced conditioning regimen followed by allogeneic SCT in pts with myelofibrosis."
