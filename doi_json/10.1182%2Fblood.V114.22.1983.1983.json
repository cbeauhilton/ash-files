    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1983 Poster Board I-1005 Introduction: In mouse, acute anemia leads to the rapid expansion and differentiation of stress erythroid progenitors in the spleen. It has been shown that these progenitors respond to BMP4, Stem Cell Factor and hypoxia and differentiate into stress BFU-E. These are sensitive to high levels of erythropoietin (EPO) and rapidly expand in the spleen, allowing rapid recovery from the anemia (JM Perry et al., Blood 2009, 113:911-918). Inflammation is known to inhibit growth and differentiation of erythroid progenitors and to suppress EPO synthesis in the kidney. However, the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on this stress erythropoiesis response is not known. We have recently developed a mouse model of zymosan-induced generalized inflammation and shown that stimulation of erythropoiesis by repeated blood withdrawal or injections of erythropoietin favours iron mobilization from tissue iron stores (S. Lasocki et al., CCM 2008, 36:2388-2394), suggesting that EPO treatment may be beneficial provided effective erythropoiesis can be elicited. Objectives: The aim of our study was to assess the impact of EPO injections on the stress erythropoietic response in this mouse model of chronic inflammation. Methods: Mice (C57BL/6) received a single intraperitoneal injection of zymosan at day 1 (Z1) followed by four consecutive daily injections of EPO at day 5, 6, 7 and 8. Mice were analyzed one day (Z9EPO1), four days (Z12EPO4) or nine days (Z17EPO9) after the final injection and compared to controls, Z alone or EPO alone. Double Ter119/CD71 labelling was used to analyze the different stages of erythroblast differentiation by FACS, in bone marrow and spleen in the different conditions. Spleen BMP4 expression was followed by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Serum EPO levels were measured by ELISA and haematological parameters were recorded. Results: In the inflammatory condition, bone marrow erythropoiesis is suppressed and does not respond to EPO injections. There is a concomitant increased in the percentage of apoptotic Ter119+ cells. In the spleen, inflammation increases spleen size but only moderately stimulates the percentage of erythroblasts. However, EPO injections lead to a 10-fold increase in the percentage of immature erythroblasts at Z9EPO1, followed three days later (Z12EPO4) by a similar increase in the proportion of mature erythroblasts. This finally results in increased reticulocytes and haemoglobin concentration. In the spleen, BMP4 mRNAs are not stimulated by inflammation but significantly increased by EPO injections, both in normal mice and mice with Zymosan-induced inflammation. The protein BMP4 is expressed by erythroid precursors and stromal cells. Double labelling with F4/80 and BMP4 clearly shows that spleen macrophages are the BMP4-expressing cells following EPO injections in mice with a generalized inflammation. Conclusion: In mouse, bone marrow erythropoiesis is repressed by inflammation as it has been shown for human erythropoiesis and it does not respond to EPO injections. By contrast, spleen stress erythropoiesis is strongly stimulated by injections of EPO despite the presence of inflammation. This results from a strong increase in BMP4 synthesis by spleen macrophages. BMP4 is known to be stimulated by acute anemia but our study is the first report of a direct effect of EPO injections on BMP4 expression in the spleen and of the identification of macrophages as the stromal cells producing BMP4. It will be of interest to find out if bone marrow macrophages in humans can synthesize BMP4 and also contribute to a medullar stress erythropoietic response.
