    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Fibromodulin (FMOD), a collagen binding protein, was shown to be highly overexpressed in CLL cells compared to normal B lymphocytes by gene expression profiling. Therefore FMOD might serve as potential tumor associated antigen (TAA) in CLL, enabling expansion of FMOD-specific T cells. FMOD is physiologically expressed in articular cartilage, tendon and ligament. Furthermore, interactions of FMOD with the growth factor TGF-b were described and it may be a biologically relevant modulator of TGF-b activity. Methods: Unpulsed native CLL cells and CD40 ligand (CD40L)-stimulated CLL cells as antigen presenting cells (APC) were used to expand autologous T cells from 13 patients. RESULTS: In CLL samples derived from 16 patients, high expression of FMOD by real-time RT-PCR was detectable in contrast to normal B lymphocytes. The number of T cells during four weeks of in vitro culture increased 2-fold with native CLL cells as APC and 3.5-fold with CD40L-stimulated CLL cells as APC. The amount of T cells recognizing HLA-A0201 binding FMOD-derived peptides detected by HLA-A2-dimer/peptide staining increased 10-fold during in vitro culture. The T cells expanded were also able to secrete IFN-g upon recognition of the antigen demonstrated by IFN-g-ELISPOT assays. T cells not only recognized HLA-A0201 binding FMOD peptides presented by TAP-deficient T2 cells, but also FMOD overexpressing autologous CLL cells in an HLA-A0201 restricted manner. Neither HLA-A0201 negative CLL cells nor non-malignant cells, i.e. PBMC from healthy donors or tonsilar B cells, were specifically recognized by T cells. When CD40L-stimulated CLL cells were used as APC, which were pulsed with FMOD peptides prior to coincubation with the T cells, significant higher amounts of T cells specifically recognized autologous CLL cells in IFN-g-ELISPOT assays P < 0.018). CONCLUSION: FMOD was shown for the first time to be naturally processed and ( presented as TAA in primary CLL cells. This enables the expansion of autologous tumor-specific T cells which might be applicable in clinical vaccination trials or as a tool for a CLL-specific immune monitoring in the context of vaccination approaches including CD40L-gene modified autologous leukemic cells.",
