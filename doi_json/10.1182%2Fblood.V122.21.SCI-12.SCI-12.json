    "abstract_text": "Expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, \u03b12\u03b32) greatly ameliorates the severity of the major hemoglobin disorders, sickle cell disease (SCD), and the \u03b2-thalassemias. Efforts to reactivate HbF in adults with these disorders have relied on empirical observations or therapeutic modalities that are indirect. A major goal for the field is the development of targeted reactivation of HbF through relief of \u03b3-globin gene silencing. The regulatory factors that participate in the switch from HbF to HbA in ontogeny and in \u03b3-gene silencing in the adult have been elusive, therefore precluding mechanism-based reactivation of HbF. Recent findings, largely derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have transformed the current understanding of globin switching. This presentation will review recent evidence supporting direct involvement of the zinc-finger repressor protein BCL11A in both developmental switching of globins and HbF silencing in the adult. These studies include the impact of naturally occurring genetic variation at the BCL11A locus on HbF levels, proof-of-principle experiments in genetically engineered mice suggesting that interference with BCL11A action alone may be sufficient to provide therapeutic elevation of HbF, and the nature of protein partners of BCL11A that may mediate some aspects of BCL11A function. Recent findings on the manner in which genetic variation within the BCL11A locus influences BCL11A expression provide special insight into quantitative aspects of HbF regulation and raise the possibility of new strategies to cripple BCL11A. The opportunities and challenges for the development of mechanism-based reactivation of HbF will be discussed in the context of ongoing efforts to exploit small molecule and genetic approaches. The tools are in hand to translate an improved understanding of globin gene regulation for the benefit of patients with the major hemoglobin disorders.
