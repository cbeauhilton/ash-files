    "abstract_text": "Background : Isatuximab (ISA) is an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody with multiple modes of action for killing tumor cells through immune cell engagement and direct tumor targeting. In preclinical studies, pomalidomide (Pom) enhanced both the direct and indirect anti-tumor activity of ISA to a greater degree than lenalidomide (Len) (Jiang et al. Leukemia 2016). Here, we report the preliminary results of an ongoing Phase Ib dose-escalation study of ISA plus Pom and dexamethasone (Dex) in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) (NCT02283775). Methods : Patients with RRMM (\u22652 prior MM therapies, including Len and a proteasome inhibitor) with adequate bone marrow reserve/organ function were sequentially enrolled to receive ISA 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg (weekly \u00d7 4 doses, then every 2 weeks until disease progression or intolerable toxicity) in combination with Pom 4 mg (days 1-21) and Dex 40 mg (days 1, 8, 15, and 22; 20 mg if \u226575 years old), in 28-day cycles. Pom or Dex dose reductions were permitted after Cycle 1, or during Cycle 1 in response to dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dose, based on the occurrence of treatment-related DLTs. Secondary objectives included evaluation of efficacy (by objective response assessment according to IMWG criteria), safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK). Results : At data cut-off (May 11, 2016), 14 patients had been treated in the first 2 dose-escalation cohorts: 8 patients at 5 mg/kg and 6 patients at 10 mg/kg. Overall, median age was 65.5 (range, 42-77) years and median time from diagnosis was 4.25 (1.0-12.5) years. Half of the patients (7/14) had received at least 5 prior regimens (median 4.5 [2-11]; prior carfilzomib in 50% of patients). Ten patients (71%) had received at least one prior stem cell transplant. Median duration of dosing was 21.2 (4-42) and 8.1 (4-12) weeks in the 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg cohorts, respectively, with the latter cohort also having the shortest follow-up. Three patients discontinued treatment, all in the 5 mg/kg cohort: 2 due to confirmed disease progression (discontinuation after 2 and 4 treatment cycles, respectively) and 1 due to patient withdrawal (discontinuation in Cycle 1 and patient not evaluable for response). There were no discontinuations due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in either cohort. Two DLTs were reported: one in the 5 mg/kg cohort (prolonged grade [Gr] 4 neutropenia), and the other in the 10 mg/kg cohort (Gr 4 neutropenic infection); both DLTs resolved with Pom dose delay/reduction. MTD has not yet been reached; the 20 mg/kg dose level is under enrollment. Overall, Gr 3/4 TEAEs were reported in 10 (71%) patients; serious TEAEs in 6 (43%) patients. The most frequent TEAEs were fatigue (64%), upper respiratory tract infection, tremor, dyspnea, and cough (29% each). The most common Gr 3/4 hematologic abnormality (laboratory assessment) was neutropenia (Gr 1, 0%; Gr 2, 7%; Gr 3, 43%; Gr 4, 43%). Gr 3/4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 4 (29%) patients (Gr 3, n=2; Gr 4, n=2). Infusion-associated reactions (IARs) occurred in 8 (57%) patients, with all cases Gr 1/2 in severity. IARs occurred during the first infusion in most patients; 3/14 (21%) patients experienced IARs at a subsequent infusion, of whom only one had IARs after Cycle 1. Of the patients evaluable for confirmed response, 8/13 (62%) achieved at least partial response (PR), and 10/13 (77%) at least minimal response (MR). At 5 mg/kg, 1 patient achieved complete response (CR), 2 very good partial response (VGPR) and 2 PR. At 10 mg/kg, 2 patients achieved VGPR, 1 PR, and 2 MR. Of the eight patients who achieved at least PR, all continued to respond without confirmed disease progression at data cut-off. The PK parameters of ISA were not affected by co-administration with Pom/Dex. Conclusions : These preliminary data suggest that the combination of ISA and Pom/Dex is generally well tolerated and clinically active in patients with heavily pre-treated RRMM. Enrollment continues and longer term follow-up from this study, including data from the 20 mg/kg cohort, will be presented. A Phase III trial to evaluate ISA plus Pom/Dex is planned.
