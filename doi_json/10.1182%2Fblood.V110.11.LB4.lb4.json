    "abstract_text": "Life-threatening sequelae in \u03b2-thalassemia major patients (TM), result from transfusion iron overload (Fe load). Combined chelation with desferrioxamine (DFO) and deferiprone (DFP) is well tolerated and produces a synergistic effect superior to either drug alone. Combination can place all TMp in negative net iron balance and effect significant reduction in Fe load. 50 TM (24 males, 26 females) aged 8\u201348 yrs, were switched from monotherapy with DFO, to an individually tailored regimen (DFO 40\u201360 mg/kg/day- DFP 75\u2013100 mg/kg/day) for 5\u20136yrs. Fe load was evaluated by mean ferritin levels (MEIA) and non-invasive heart &hepatic iron quantification, by annual Signa-MRI 1.5 Tesla, multi-echo T2 sequences. The heart was evaluated by Echo Doppler. Endocrine function was assessed by:- thyroid: FT4, FT3 &TSH in TRH-test, - Gonads: estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, Free-testosterone levels &LHRH stimulation- Glucose tolerance: OGGT with glucose &insulin measurements at each time and area under the curve (AUC). Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function were assessed by indices of homeostasis model assessment (ISIHOMA &SCHOMA). Subsequently, all patients survived, even though with DFO alone in the previous decade, mortality ranged from 13.3\u201314.3%. In patients who accepted the treatment well, a trend analysis (PROC MIXED in SAS), revealed a negative trend of ferritin over time (p126 mg/dl, 2h>200mg/dl), 16/50 had Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT: glucose 2h>140100<126 mg/dl). Following intensive combined chelation, 9/14 (64%), 10/16 (67%) and 3/3 (100%) respectively, normalised their glucose metabolism (p <0.001). An improvement in the glucose AUC was also noted (ANOVA-GENERAL LINEAR MODEL: p<0.002) despite BMI increase (p<0,001). Additionally, insulin secretion increased (SCHOMA: p<0,05 and Friedman/Wilcoxon p<0,004) and insulin sensitivity reduced, (ISIHOMA: p<0,742). These results indicate that in our patient cohort, intensive combination dramatically improved survival and led to reversal of secondary iron overload sequelae.",
