    "abstract_text": "Background and Methods: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) bearing the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene is known to be one of the core-binding factor AML (CBF-AML) which exerts relatively good prognosis. The RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene are present in approximately 3.5% of patients with AML (data from cBioPortal). However, the real-world epidemiology of this mutation and co-existing gene alterations have not been fully investigated in Japan. We launched an actionable mutation profiling multicenter study named Hematologic Malignancies (HM)-SCREEN-Japan 01 (UMIN000035233), in which a comprehensive genomic assay was performed by Foundation One Heme (F1H) panel for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML as well as patients with newly-diagnosed (ND) AML who were ineligible for standard chemotherapy. Paraffin-embedded bone marrow samples were gathered from 17 Japanese faculties and the F1H reports were returned to the patients. Results: We found 12 patients (6.8%) with the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene out of 177 patients who joined this study and the F1H report was successfully retuned. Eight of these patients were enrolled as R/R AML and four were enrolled as ND AML who are ineligible for standard chemotherapy. Four (50%) of R/R patients were received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Among the 12 patients with the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene, eight (66.7%) had KIT mutation. The major amino acid alteration of KIT was D816V/Y and two patients had two different point-mutations of KIT (one with D816Y plus D816V and the other with D816V plus N822K). No particular mutations, other than KIT, were predominantly co-occurred with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene. Especially in R/R patients, 75 % of them had the KIT mutation. Two R/R patients without the KIT mutation had JAK2 V617F and FLT3 D835Y respectively. Conclusions: AML with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene is currently not indicated for transplantation in the first remission. Previous studies have demonstrated that approximately 30% of patients with CBF-AML harbored the KIT mutations at diagnosis, which might be an indicator of poor prognosis. In our study, the KIT mutations were detected much more frequently than in previously studies of newly-diagnosed CBF-AML. This result may suggest that patients with the KIT mutations were concentrated because our study targeted AML patients who were R/R to prior therapy or ineligible for standard chemotherapy. In addition, no specific mutations highly related to the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene were detected other than the KIT mutation, suggesting the KIT mutation might be a suitable molecular marker to predict poor prognosis in AML with the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene. Our study revealed the importance of KIT mutations in patients with R/R AML with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene, and that the KIT mutations may be a promising therapeutic target for this population. Furthermore, it is interesting that driver mutations such as JAK2 and FLT3 mutation were detected in R/R patients without KIT mutation, although further investigation is needed. This suggests that comprehensive genomic assays are highly useful in establishing precision medicine, even in this type of AML, which is generally considered to have a good prognosis. Since most of R/R patients need allo-SCT, precision medicine targeting KIT may be considered for post-recurrence treatment in AML with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene, such as bridge therapy to transplantation, in the future.
