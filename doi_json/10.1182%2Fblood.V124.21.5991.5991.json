    "abstract_text": "Benzene is an established cause of adult leukemia but its association with childhood leukemia remains unclear. We performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature on benzene and childhood leukemia, and used meta-analysis to explore causal inference, evaluate bias, and identify sources of heterogeneity. The summary relative risk estimate (RR) for childhood leukemia for all studies combined was 1.84 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.43, 2.37; n=23). In studies of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the RR was 2.22 (95%CI: 1.65, 2.99; n=8). For studies of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), the RR was lower (RR=1.62; 95%CI: 1.28, 2.04; n=16). Summary relative risks were higher for studies examining maternal (RR=1.96; 95%CI: 1.39, 2.78; n=13) versus paternal exposure (RR=1.23; 95%CI: 1.07, 1.41; n=14), and in studies assessing benzene exposure based on maternal occupation (RR=1.71; 95%CI: 0.91, 3.24; n=6) compared to paternal occupation (RR=1.18; 95%CI: 0.94, 1.50; n=6) or traffic density (RR=0.97; 95%CI: 0.75, 1.25; n=6). Summary relative risks were also higher for exposure during gestation (RR=1.91; 95%CI: 1.32, 2.75; n=12) compared to other periods, and remained elevated in studies adjusted for smoking or socioeconomic status. Overall, these findings suggest that benzene is associated with increased risk of childhood leukemia. Disclosures Smith: University of California: Consultancy."
