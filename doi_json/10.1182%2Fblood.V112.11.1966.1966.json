    "abstract_text": "In the German Multicenter ALL studies (GMALL) patients aged >55 years with high risk (B-lineage ALL with WBC at diagnosis >30000, late CR, t (4; 11), complex aberrant karyotype or prae-T or mature T-ALL) or very high risk (Ph+/BCR-ABL+) ALL are increasingly candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allogeneic SCT with a HLA identical sibling donor, MRD or a matched unrelated donor, MUD) or autologous SCT. Here, we report on 31 elderly patients transplanted within the GMALL studies 06/99 and 07/03. Median age of the patients was 61 years (56\u201365). 22 patients belonged to the very high risk group (VHR), 8 patients to the high risk group (HR) and 1 patient from the standard risk group (SR) was transplanted because of detection of minimal residual disease.17/31 patients were transplanted from a matched unrelated donor, 9/31 patients from a HLA identical sibling donor and 5/31 patients underwent autologous SCT. Conditioning regimens for MRD SCT were myeloablative (MAC) in 6 patients (TBI 12 Gy and chemotherapy n=2, radioimmunotherapy + chemotherapy n=2, chemotherapy only n=2) and 3 patients received reduced intensity conditioning (RIC).Conditioning regimens for MUD SCT changed over time with an increasing number of RIC in the study 07/03. In total, 7/17 patients received MAC (TBI 12 Gy and chemotherapy n=5, chemotherapy only n=2) and 10/17 patients received RIC. Conditioning regimens in autologous SCT were myeloablative (MAC) in 5/5 patients. Results: After allogeneic MRD SCT 4/9 patients (44%) are alive in CCR (d+ 24, d+ 611, d+ 1721, d+ 2321), 3/9 patients died due to leukemia, 2/9 due to transplant related mortality (TRM). After allogeneic MUD SCT 8/17 patients (46%) are alive in CCR (from d+ 165 to d+ 2176). 1 further patient is alive after re- SCT for treatment of relapse. 7/17 patients died due to TRM and 1 patient died due to relapse. After autologous SCT 2/5 patients are alive in CCR (d+ 1703, d+ 1731), 3/5 died due to relapse. Risk factors for TRM: In allo SCT and MAC 8/13 patients died due to TRM in contrast to 1/13 patients with RIC. In auto SCT none of the patients died due to TRM. Risk factors for relapse: In allogeneic MRD SCT 3/9 patients died due to relapse and 2/17 patients relapsed after MUD SCT. Due to the small number of patients, no difference between MAC and RIC could be found. In autologous SCT 3/5 patients died due to relapse. In conclusion: The study shows that allo MRD but also MUD SCT is very effective in a selected population of elderly ALL patients. Since the survival of elderly patients with chemotherapy only is about 25%, more patients should be encouraged to have a MRD or MUD SCT.",
