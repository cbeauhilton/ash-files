    "abstract_text": "Abstract 40 Introduction: This independent trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of bortezomib (B) during induction and maintenance on progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic MM, who were candidates for high-dose therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to 3 cycles of standard VAD (arm A) or PAD (Arm B); PAD was dosed as B 1.3 mg/m2, days 1,4,8,11, doxorubicin 9 mg/m2, days 1\u20134, dexamethasone 40 mg, days 1\u20134, 9\u201312, 17\u201320). Patients received one (HOVON) or two (GMMG) high-dose melphalan (HDM) 200 mg/m2 with ASCT. Maintenance consisted of thalidomide (T) 50 mg daily (arm A) or B 1.3 mg/m2, 2-weekly (arm B) for 2 years. Primary endpoint was PFS, other endpoints were complete response (CR) (EBMT), immunofixation positive CR (nCR), VGPR pre-and post HDM and survival (OS). The protocol specified analysis was intention-to-treat and censored for patients who received allo-SCT after HDM1 (n=46). We report the analysis of the first 626 randomized patients. The final analysis of all patients will be presented at the meeting. Results: 13 patients were excluded (7 not eligible, 6 not evaluable). The two arms (A:n=305;B:n=308) were well balanced for age, Salmon/Durie stage II/III, renal failure (11%), and serum B2M. Medium follow-up is 40 months. 89% of patients completed induction and HDM1. In GMMG after HDM1 80% of patients received 2nd HDM. Full dose B could be administered in 82% of patients. Polyneuropathy (PNP) WHO gr 3+4 occurred in 7% (arm A) and 16% (arm B). 204 (67%, arm A) and 174 (57%, arm B) patients started maintenance. 64% of patients tolerated full dose B and 27% reduced dose. 47% of patients on B maintenance went off protocol because of toxicity (9%), progression (29%) or other (9%). In contrast 64 % on T maintenance went off protocol because of toxicity (31%), progression (31%) or other (2%). nCR/CR rates were 7/9% (arm A) vs 9/21% (arm B) at 3 months after HDM-1 and 12/26% (arm A) vs 12/38% (arm B) on protocol. \u2265VGPR in arm-A vs arm-B were 40% vs 60% after HDM-1 and 61% vs 75% on protocol. PFS was superior in arm B (HR 0.81, p=0.047; adjusted for ISS: HR 0.81, p=0.056). PFS at 36 months was 42% (arm A) vs 46% (arm B). Multivariate Cox regression showed treatment arm (p=0.037), IgA (p=0.007), ISS stage (p=0.007), WHO Performance Status (p<0.0001), del13/13q- (p=0.015) and study group (2nd HDM) (p=0.015) as significant PFS variables. Patients treated with bortezomib had a better OS (HR 0.74, p=0.048), with study arm, WHO, IgA, ISS stage and del13/13q- as significant variables. Subgroup analysis of response at 12 months showed no impact on PFS and an impact of VGPR/nCR/CR on OS only in arm A. Adverse cytogenetic markers (p<0.05) in the combined group were 13q14, 17p-, t(4;14) for PFS and OS. Detailed FISH data are reported separately. The response and survival data of the subgroup analysis are given below. We conclude that B achieves high nCR/CR during induction, that B maintenance is well tolerated and is associated with additional responses. Bortezomib achieves superior PFS and results in an improvement of survival. Table: PFS, OS, minimal response achieved on protocol and subgroup analysis  . VAD/HDM/thalidomide . PAD/HDM/bortezomib .
