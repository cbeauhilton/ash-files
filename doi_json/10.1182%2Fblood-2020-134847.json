    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Daratumumab (DARA) is a human, CD38-targeting, IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody approved as monotherapy in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) and in combination with standard of care for RRMM and NDMM. The addition of DARA to standard-of-care regimens in phase 3 studies has consistently improved progression-free survival (PFS) and led to deep and durable responses, including higher rates of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity compared with standard of care. In the primary analysis of the phase 3 MAIA study (median follow-up, 28.0 mo), D-Rd vs Rd significantly improved PFS and MRD-negativity rates in transplant-ineligible NDMM (Facon T, N Engl J Med 2019). With longer follow-up (36.4 mo), D-Rd maintained a PFS benefit and deeper and more durable responses vs Rd alone (Bahlis N, Blood 2019. 134[Suppl 1]:1875). Here, we report updated efficacy and safety findings from MAIA after approximately 4 years of follow-up. Methods : Patients with NDMM ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation due to age \u226565 years or comorbidities were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive Rd \u00b1 DARA. Stratification factors included International Staging System stage (ISS [I vs II vs III]), region (North America vs other), and age (<75 vs \u226575 years). All patients received 28-day cycles of Rd (R: 25 mg orally once daily on Days 1-21; d: 40 mg orally on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22). In the D-Rd arm, DARA (16 mg/kg intravenously) was given weekly for Cycles 1-2, every 2 weeks in Cycles 3-6, and every 4 weeks thereafter. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in both treatment arms. The primary endpoint was PFS. Key secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), MRD-negativity rate (10 \u20125 sensitivity, clonoSEQ \u00ae version 2.0), and safety. PFS on the next line of therapy (PFS2), defined as the time from randomization to progression on the next subsequent line of therapy or death, was also measured. Results : A total of 737 patients were randomized (D-Rd, n = 368; Rd, n = 369). Patient baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment arms. Median (range) age was 73 (45-90) years, with 44% of patients \u226575 years of age. 27%, 43%, and 29% of all patients were ISS stage I, II, and III, respectively. Among 642 patients evaluable for FISH/karyotyping analysis, 86% had standard and 14% had high cytogenetic risk. After a median follow-up of 47.9 months, 176 (48%) and 273 (75%) patients discontinued study treatment in the D-Rd vs Rd groups, respectively, with 85 (23%) and 113 (31%) patients discontinuing treatment due to progressive disease. PFS remained improved for D-Rd vs Rd (median, not reached [NR] vs 34 mo; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.43-0.67; P< 0.0001; Figure ). The estimated 48-month PFS rate was 60% with D-Rd vs 38% with Rd. The PFS benefit of D-Rd in prespecified subgroups, including patients with high cytogenetic risk, was generally consistent with overall results. Adding DARA to Rd continued to result in deeper responses with higher rates of \u2265CR and \u2265very good partial response (VGPR; Table ). Median duration of response among responders was NR with D-Rd vs 44 months with Rd. Median PFS2 was NR vs 51 months with D-Rd vs Rd, respectively (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52-0.83; P =0.0005); follow up is ongoing. 107 (29%) patients in the D-Rd group and 132 (36%) in the Rd group have discontinued the study due to death. Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; D-Rd/Rd) occurring in \u226510% of patients were neutropenia (53%/37%), pneumonia (18%/11%), anemia (16%/21%), lymphopenia (16%/11%), hypokalemia (12%/10%), leukopenia (11%/6%), and cataract (11%/10%); grade 3/4 infection rates were 40%/29%. The most common serious TEAE was pneumonia (17%/11%). 11% of patients in the D-Rd arm and 22% in the Rd arm discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. The complete updated data set will be presented at the meeting with additional efficacy endpoints, including MRD-negativity rate. Conclusion : After 48 months follow up, the addition of DARA to Rd continues to demonstrate a superior PFS benefit. More patients continued to have deeper and more durable responses with D-Rd vs Rd alone. No new safety concerns were observed with longer follow-up. These results continue to support the use of D-Rd in the first line of treatment for patients with transplant-ineligible NDMM.
