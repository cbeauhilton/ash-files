    "abstract_text": "Aims: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) have the potential to improve hematopoietic transplantation by supporting hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion as well as by promoting HSPC engraftment to the BM. However, culture expanded MSCs becomes a mixture of progenitor cells committed to different cell lineages, each with different potencies for any one desired application. Clinically, the accumulation of adipogenic MSCs in the BM is believed to contribute towards age-related impairment of regeneration and hematopoiesis; this observation, together with our understanding of the inverse relationship between MSC osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation prompted a more in depth study of the ability of these different MSC lineages to support hematopoietic clinical applications. Clinically relevant methods for engineering a pure cell population from heterogeneous MSC culture will also be discussed. Methods: MSCs were derived from the healthy BM of patients aged 30-50 years. At various stages of osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation in vitro , cultures were evaluated for their ability to support cord blood (CB) CD34 + HSC expansion and stimulate regenerative processes such as angiogenesis and cell proliferation. qPCR, coupled with secretome analysis was performed to discover gene expression markers for MSCs with potent hematopoietic supportive capabilities. Finally, due to the lack of unique surface markers for identification of MSC subpopulations, we utilized multivariate biophysical analysis (microfluidic sorting, atomic force microscopy, etc.), correlating these quantitative measures with biomolecular markers as well as in vitro and in vivo functionality. Novel label-free cell separation strategies that take advantage of unique biophysical traits in a potent MSC subpopulation for HSPC transplantation was also developed to enable clinical translation. Results: Differentiated osteoblasts (OB) as well as pre-OB demonstrated a higher ability to support CB CD34 + HSC expansion compared to undifferentiated MSCs or MSCs in the adipogenic state. Over a period of 10 days, the total HSPC fold expansion was 44.4 \u00b1 4.83, 57.8 \u00b1 10.67, 40.2 \u00b1 4.65, 34.2 \u00b1 6.18 and 13.8 \u00b1 5.50 for OB, pre-OB, MSCs, pre-AD and AD, respectively (n = 5). Absolute expanded CD34 + HSCs was highest with pre-OB cultures (~1.7 fold, n = 5) compared to undifferentiated MSCs. Adipogenic MSCs had much reduced capabilities for supporting HSPC expansion. In vitro angiogenic and proliferation assays showed the greatest degree of HUVEC sprouting and proliferation (~ 2.6 fold greater than undifferentiated MSCs) when exposed to a pre-OB secretome. Pre-OBs are distinct in their transcriptome (up-regulated osteopontin, runx2, angiopoietin-1, FGF1, etc) but no surface marker reliably distinguishes them from other MSCs. We subsequently found a minimal set of three biophysical markers: cell diameter, membrane stiffness and nuclear membrane fluctuations, which collectively are predictive of MSC subpopulations (multipotent vs committed progenitors). We hypothesized and experimentally verified that a biophysically derived pre-OB subpopulation, defined biophysically as MSCs with >20 \u03bcm diameter, >375Pa stiffness and <1.2 % nuclear fluctuation, exhibits significantly greater efficacy over other MSC subpopulations for promoting bone marrow repair (~2-3 fold improvements in medial survival following BM injury) and expansion of HSPCs (~1.5-2 fold increase in HSPC numbers). Following co-transplantation with HSPCs, biophysically derived pre-OB promoted faster engraftment of donor cells in the peripheral blood by week 4 (~ 9% vs < 5% in other MSC groups, P<0.05). Conclusion: These results demonstrate a correlation between MSCs with high osteogenic activity and the capabilities for BM repair as well as hematopoietic support, making such cells ideal for augmentation of HSC transplantations. In the absence of reliable surface markers for isolation of these pre-OBs, we developed a clinically relevant biophysical isolation strategy for derivation of pre-OBs that can markedly improve the efficacy of MSC-based approaches for augmentation of hematopoietic transplants.
