    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3694 Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma comprises approximately 8% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas and is the most common lymphoma in the gastrointestinal tract. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) overexpression and nuclear expression has been associated with high-grade MALT lymphomas unresponsive to H. pylori eradication treatment. To explore the molecular mechanism of BCL10 overexpression on the pathogenesis and malignant phenotype of MALT lymphoma, we generated E\u03bcSR-BCL10 transgenic mice. Results in our previous report showed that predisposition to marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZL) development was enhanced in these transgenic mice. MALT lymphoma precursor cells - marginal zone (MZ) B cells - are expanded in BCL10 transgenic mice. Constitutive activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-\u03baB pathways was identified in these MZ B cells. Elevated expression of BAFF, a NF-\u03baB downstream gene, may be in part responsible for increased tumor cell survival in MALT lymphomas. In this continuing study, quantitative analysis of BCL10 protein levels and the extent of MZ B cell expansion in heterozygous (Tg/+) and homozygous (Tg/Tg) E\u03bcSR-BCL10 transgenic mice demonstrated a direct pathogenic effect of BCL10 protein on MALT lymphomagenesis. The activities of caspase-8 and caspase-3, but not caspase-9, were inhibited with increasing BCL10 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Apoptosis induced by anti-IgM was selectively inhibited in MZ B cells from transgenic mice, but no differences were observed following treatment with dexamethasone, \u03b3-irradiation or anti-CD95, implying that overexpressed BCL10 exerts anti-apoptotic effects through the B-cell antigen receptor pathway. Expression of API2, another NF-\u03baB downstream gene, was also elevated in a dose-dependent manner with BCL10 protein level in the MZ B cells. Overexpressed BCL10 protein co-immunoprecipitated with caspase-8 and API2, suggesting an in vivo interaction leading to inhibition of caspase-8 activity. Our current data suggests a novel effect of overexpressed BCL10 in the pathogenesis of high-grade MALT lymphoma by increasing expression of API2 and recruitment of API2 and caspase-8 to form a protein complex leading to the suppression of caspase-8 activity in MZ B cells.
