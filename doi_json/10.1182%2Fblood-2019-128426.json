    "abstract_text": "Platelet activation by ITAM receptors contributes to hemostasis, thrombosis, vascular integrity and host defense. In the course of our studies of Fc\u03b3RIIA-mediated platelet activation, we became interested in those mechanisms that require neither full Syk activation nor changes in intracellular calcium. Calcium-independent phospholipase family member iPLA2\u03b2 has been observed to modulate phospholipid remodeling and second messenger generation in human platelets (Beckett, Thromb Res 2007; Duvernay, Biochem 2015), while iPLA2\u03b3 has been studied in knockout mouse platelets (Yoda, JTH 2014) with modest effects noted on thrombosis and hemostasis. These enzymes do not require increased cytoplasmic calcium for their activity in cleaving the acyl group from the sn2 position of phospholipids to yield a free fatty acid and a lysophospholipid. However, the precise role of iPLA2\u03b2 in human and mouse platelet activation has not been elucidated. Neither has the contribution of iPLA2\u03b2 in the response to Fc\u03b3RIIA-mediated activation been reported. We identified the presence of iPLA2\u03b2 protein in western blots of human and Fc\u03b3RIIA transgenic mouse platelets. Of interest, multiple isoforms arising from proteolytic cleavage were detected. We treated washed human and Fc\u03b3RIIA transgenic mouse platelets with agonists to Fc\u03b3RIIA (IV.3 + GAM) and to GPVI (collagen or collagen-related peptide) in the absence and presence of pharmacologic inhibitors of iPLA2\u03b2. At a range of agonist doses up to 3X threshold, we observed significant inhibition of aggregation, dense granule secretion and alpha granule secretion (p<0.05 vs. vehicle only, n = 3 to 4 each). Inhibition occurred with either S-BEL (bromo-enolactone) or with FKGK18 (a fluoroketone), two chemically distinct iPLA2\u03b2 inhibitor molecules with different modes of action. The IC50 for S-BEL was found to be 1.02 uM for human Fc\u03b3RIIA, 2.04 uM for human GPVI, and 2.76 uM for transgenic mouse Fc\u03b3RIIA activated platelets. FKGK18 was less potent, with IC50s at 7.88 uM for human Fc\u03b3RIIA. In contrast, iPLA2\u03b3 inhibitor R-BEL was able to inhibit Fc\u03b3RIIA -mediated activation, but at an IC50 of 2.62 uM. Notably, iPLA2\u03b2 inhibition could eliminate ATP secretion from dense granules downstream of Fc\u03b3RIIA and GPVI activation. When we added ADP to Fc\u03b3RIIA stimulation in the presence of inhibitory doses of S-BEL, we overcame the inhibition. We have identified for the first time that iPLA2\u03b2 contributes to aggregation and secretion of both human and Fc\u03b3RIIA transgenic mouse platelets. The platelets were slightly more sensitive to Fc\u03b3RIIA than to GPVI inhibition. In other activatable secretory cells, iPLA2\u03b2 plays both a homeostatic and signaling role. The mechanisms of iPLA2\u03b2 action in platelets merit further study. Studies are in progress with genetic knockdown and knockout of the enzyme, to complement the findings with inhibitors.
