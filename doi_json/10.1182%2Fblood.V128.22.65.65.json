    "abstract_text": "Background: Delayed platelet (plt) recovery and secondary thrombocytopenia occur in 5-25% of patients (pts) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and is of adverse prognostic significance. Plt transfusion to prevent bleeding remains a mainstay of therapy and role of thrombopoietic agents is not known. In this phase I/II multicenter open trial, we investigated the safety and efficacy of romiplostim (Nplate; Amgen, thousand Oaks, CA) for (pts) with transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia after allogeneic HSCT (NCT01980030). Patients and methods: Adult pts undergoing standard of care allogeneic HSCT for any disease except myelodysplastic syndrome were eligible for this study 45 days or more after transplantation if they had plt count \u00b2 20 x 10 9 /L sustained for 7 days (\u00b2 50 x 10 9 /L with a history of bleeding) or if they were plt transfusion dependent. Pts were excluded if they had abnormal liver function tests, serum creatinine \u00b3 176.8 \u03bcmol/L or had prior venous thrombosis. Pts were given weekly romiplostim for 12 weeks with intra-pt weekly dose escalation from 1\u00b5g/Kg to a maximum dose of 10 \u00b5g/Kg (with a dose reduction schema in case of plt overshoot). The study was composed of a 12-week treatment period. The primarysafety endpoint was the incidence of any grade 3 or 4 adverse events after HSCT, excluding those expected from the HSCT, as well as clinically significant bleeding events. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to reach a plt count above 50 x 10 9 /L free of plt transfusion. Secondary endpoints were the durable plt response defined as a plt count above 50 x 10 9 /L during 8 consecutive weeks independent of plts transfusions, the 1-year cumulative incidence (CumI) after HSCT of Graft versus host disease (GvHD), relapse and non-relapse mortality rates. All pts had a bone marrow biopsy before treatment and at one year. This study was approved by the research review board of the Hospital Saint-Louis (Paris, France). Statistical analysis was based on a modified intent-to-treat basis, excluding pts who did not fulfill the inclusion criteria. CumI were estimated using nonparametric methods, where deaths prior to the event of interest defined competing risks. Results: 25 pts were included in 4 different HSCT French units between April 2013 and November 2015. The analysis was restricted to 24 pts (one pt with plt count > 20x10 9 /L after inclusion). All but one pt have malignant disease (13/24 acute leukemia). Donor type was related for 12 pts. Stem cell source was peripheral blood in 15 pts and bone marrow in 9 pts, myeloablative conditioning regimen was used in 17 pts. Median time between HSCT and romiplostim initiation was 85 days (interquartile range, IQR 63 - 117). Nineteen pts completed the 12 investigational injections of romiplostim, while five did not due to 3 deaths (1 post transplantation EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorder, 1 relapse and 1 septic shock), 1 boost of donor stem cells and one pt with plt count above 50 Giga/L after 8 injections. A total of 21 adverse events (grade 3, n=10; grade 4 n=11) considered possibly related to romiplostim were reported in 6 pts. Hematological complications appeared in 4 pts (2 neutropenia, 1 anemia and 1 pancytopenia) and liver dysfunction was present in 2 pts (mild cytolysis). Overall, romiplostim was well tolerated with a 6 months adverse events CI of 25.2% (95%IC 7.3 - 43.2). No bleeding event as well as no thrombotic complications appeared. None of the pts developed fibrosis 1 year post treatment (2 pts not yet at 1 year). After romiplostim initiation, 20 pts received a plt transfusion. The median time to reach a plt count above 50 x 10 9 /L free of plt transfusion was 36 days (Figure 1) , with required doses of 4 mg/Kg (IQR, 3-6). Fifteen pts obtained a durable plt response. A total of 17 and 12 pts experienced aGVHD and cGVHD, respectively, with 100 days CumI of aGVHD of 67% (95%CI, 47-87) and 1-year CumI of cGvHD of 55% (95%CI, 32-78), respectively. Six pts died during the study (1 PTLD, 1 relapse, 1 septic shock, 1 lung aspergillosis and 2 acute distress respiratory syndrome of unknown origin). CumI of non-relapse mortality was thus of 21% (95%CI, 7-42%). Conclusion: Romiplostim can be safely administered and improves plt count in pts with thrombocytopenia after allogeneic HSCT. The required dose to reach plt count above 50 x 10 9 /L is 4 mg/Kg with a median time of 36 days. Research support was provided in part by Amgen.
