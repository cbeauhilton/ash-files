    "abstract_text": "Context The molecular characteristics of this disease remain widely unknown in Lebanon. Cytogenetics and molecular testing in AML are becoming routine practice for disease classification and prognosis. In Lebanon, a nationwide study showed an incidence of 1.1% among all cancers in 2003, slightly more predominant in males. Objective The aim of this study was to describe patient's characteristics and outcome in Lebanese patients. Design 80 patients from a single Lebanese center were included. We reviewed disease characteristics of patients diagnosed with AML between January 2008 and December 2020. Medical files were reviewed and SPSS software was used for statistical analysis. Results 48.1 % of patients were males, with a median age of 61 years at diagnosis. Cytopenia was present at 30% of patients. Diagnosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspirate in 95% of the patients. Karyotype was missing in 48% of patients. When available, 13%, 54% and 33% were respectively in the low, intermediate, and high risk group. FLT3 was positive in 47.4% of tested cases and NPM1 in 16.7%. No patient was found to have t (16;16) and 5.4% have inversion 16. PML-RARA was positive in 2% of patients. Idarubicin-cytosar was given as induction treatment for 82% of patients. 58% achieved complete remission, 2% were in partial remission and 40% were primary refractory. 51.7% relapsed after remission. PFS was 11 months with a median OS of 17 months. No significant statistical correlation was found between Karyotype on diagnosis and survival [P = 0.3]. Conclusion Our study is the first to describe AML characteristics in Lebanon. Multicenter studies are needed to elaborate a clinical and epidemiological data register for leukemia patients in Lebanon. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
