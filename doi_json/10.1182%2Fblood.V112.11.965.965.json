    "abstract_text": "Patients in need of an allogenetic hematopoietic cell transplant but who lack an HLA genotypically identical sibling donor, are faced with the decision to consider a single HLA antigen mismatched related donor, or a search for a suitable 8/8 matched unrelated donor. We compared the outcomes of adult patients (\u226518 years old) receiving a transplant for the treatment of AML or ALL in first or second remission from either a one-antigen mismatched related donor (MMRD group, N=89) reported to the CIBMTR or an 8/8 HLA-A, B, C and DRB1 allele matched unrelated donor (UD group, N=700) facilitated by the NMDP between 1995\u20132005. MMRD group was typed by serological or DNA-based methods for HLA-A, -B and \u2013DR with all results verified by lab report review. The UD group was retrospectively typed for HLA-A, B, C and DRB1 by high resolution typing methods. Most received myeloablative conditioning regimens (77%), calcineurin inhibitor-based GVHD prophylaxis (100%) and T cell replete grafts (100%). 13% received ATG with the conditioning regimen. Median follow-up was 54 and 38 months in the MMRD and UD groups, respectively. The MMRD group was younger (median age 35 vs 43, p=0.002), had more ALL patients with low-risk cytogenetics (43% vs 18%, p=0.005), had older donors (median age: 38 vs 34, p=0.047), were more likely to receive methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis (89% vs 77%, p=0.014) and were more likely to be transplanted prior to 2001 (62% vs 24%; p<0.001). There were no differences in patient or donor gender, diagnosis, disease-status, cytogenetic-risk of AML, time from diagnosis to transplant, stem cell source, conditioning regimen, use of ATG and Karnofsky index. Univariate comparisons (MMRD vs. UD) showed: 3-year OS (42% vs 44%, p=0.647), 3-year DFS (41% vs 41%, p=0.931), 3-year TRM (39% vs 31%, p=0.136), 3-year incidence of relapse (20% vs 28%, p=0.094), grade III\u2013IV acute GVHD by 100 days (22% vs. 15%, p=0.147), chronic GVHD by 1 year (35% vs 47%, p=0.029). All multivariate analyses were adjusted for patient and transplant characteristics and are shown in the table below. In summary, transplants utilizing one-antigen mismatched related and 8/8 allele-matched unrelated donors did not significantly differ in overall survival or disease free survival, but chronic GVHD was more frequent after UD transplantation.
