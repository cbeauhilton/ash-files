    "abstract_text": "Background: Estimates of the incidence of DVT in patients with osteomyelitis range widely from 5%-30%, however risk factors and outcomes of DVT in this cohort have not been thoroughly established. Objective: This study aims to estimate the incidence of DVT in patients with osteomyelitis, and to assess risk factors and outcomes of DVT. Design/Method: After IRB approval, a retrospective chart review was conducted for patients aged 0-18 years seen at Phoenix Children's Hospital between 2012-2016 with ICD 9/10 codes for osteomyelitis. Exclusion criteria included chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, and chronic DVT. Demographics, clinical factors and outcomes were compared between osteomyelitis patients with and without DVT using the Fisher-exact and Wilcoxon-rank sum tests, as appropriate for the data distribution. Results: A total of 179 study subjects with osteomyelitis had a mean (standard deviation) age of 8.4 (5.7) years. DVT was present in 14 (8% of 179) patients, and 4 (28%), 5 (36%) and 5 (36%) patients received anticoagulation for < 6, 6-12 and \u226512 weeks, respectively. Patients with vs without DVT were more likely to be male (86% vs 59%; p-value=0.05), and had significantly higher rates of bacteremia (64% vs 24%; p-value=0.003). Rates of central lines were comparable between DVT and non-DVT patients (71% vs 68%; p-value=1.00); however patients with DVT vs without DVT had significantly longer mean length of stay (18 vs 9 days; p-value <0.0001) and higher rates of ICU admission (71% vs 16%; p-value <0.0001). Conclusion: The incidence of DVT among osteomyelitis pediatric patients was estimated at 8%, with risk increased by male sex and bacteremia. Patients with DVT had significantly higher rates of ICU admission and longer length of hospital stay. Many of these patients had standard practice management of their DVT with 6-12 weeks of anticoagulation underscoring the need for future efforts targeting DVT prophylaxis.
