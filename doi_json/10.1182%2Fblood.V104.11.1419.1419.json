    "abstract_text": "Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a fatal malignancy of B-cell origin characterized by the accumulation of plasma cells within the bone marrow. The expression of the pro-survival members of the Bcl-2 family has been shown to be a key process in the survival of myeloma cells. More particularly, Mcl-1 expression turned out to be critical for their survival. Indeed, knockdown of Mcl-1 by antisenses induces apoptosis in myeloma cells. Finally, Mcl-1 was found to be the only anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member which level of expression was modified by cytokine treatment of myeloma cells. For these reasons, we have evaluated the expression of Mcl-1 in vivo in normal, reactive and malignant plasma cells (PC) i.e., myeloma cells from 55 patients with MM and 20 human myeloma cell lines using flow cytometry. We show that Mcl-1 is overexpressed in MM in comparison with normal bone marrow PC. Forty-seven percent of patients with MM at diagnosis (p=.017) and 80% at relapse (p=.014 for comparison with diagnosis) overexpress Mcl-1. Of note, only myeloma cell lines but not reactive plasmocytoses have abnormal Mcl-1 expression, although both plasmocyte expansion entities share similar high proliferation rates (>20%). Of interest, Bcl-2 as opposed to Mcl-1, does not discriminate malignant from normal PC. This shows that the overexpression of Mcl-1 is clearly related to malignancy rather than to proliferation. It will be important to know whether the overexpression of Mcl-1 is related to an abnormal response to cytokines like Interleukin-6 or to mutations of the promoter of the Mcl-1 gene as already described in B chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Finally, level of Mcl-1 expression is related to disease severity, the highest values being correlated with the shortest event-free survival (p=.01). In conclusion, Mcl-1 which has been shown to be essential for the survival of human myeloma cells in vitro is overexpressed in vivo in MM and correlates with disease severity. Mcl-1 represents a major therapeutical target in MM."
