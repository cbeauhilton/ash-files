    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3271 Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) is a disulfide-bonded, 25 kD homodimeric protein produced by most cell types, including platelets, that functions as a cytokine in many physiologic and pathologic processes. Platelets contain 40\u2013100 times more TGF-\u03b21 than other cells and release it as an inactive large latent complex (LLC) comprised of TGF-\u03b21 non-covalently associated with its latency-associated peptide (LAP), which is, in turn, disulfide-bonded to latent TGF-\u03b2 binding protein 1 (LTBP-1). Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), proteases, and reactive oxygen species have all been shown to activate TGF-\u03b21 in vitro and a role for integrins in vivo has been inferred from studies of transgenic mice. Recently, we discovered that shear force can activate latent TGF-\u03b21 released from platelets in vitro and that thiol-disulfide exchange contributes to shear-dependent TGF-\u03b21 activation. A number of thiol isomerase enzymes that can catalyze thiol-disulfide exchange have been identified in platelets, including protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), ERp5, ERp57, ERp72, ERp44, ERp29, and TMX3. As shear-induced activation of TGF-\u03b21 is partially thiol-dependent, we investigated if thiol isomerases can affect this process. Mastoparan is a non-thiol-containing wasp venom peptide known to inhibit the chaperone activity of PDI, ERp5, and perhaps other thiol isomerases. We recently showed that mastoparan, (INLKALAALAKKIL), inhibits stirring-induced TGF-\u03b21 activation by more than 90% (100 \u03bcM; n=3, p=0.03), whereas no inhibition was observed with an inactive mastoparan-like control peptide (INLKAKAALAKKLL) at 100 \u03bcM (n=3, p=0.66). To identify the proteins that bind to mastoparan, either directly or indirectly, platelet releasates were chromatographed on a mastoparan affinity column prepared from N-hydroxysuccinimide Sepharose. Two control columns were employed: 1. unconjugated Sepharose, and 2. Sepharose conjugated with the mastoparan-like control peptide. Elution of bound proteins was achieved by increasing the NaCl concentration. Proteins identified by mass spectrometry as specifically binding to the mastoparan peptide column included LTBP-1, TGF-\u03b21 precursor, clusterin, coagulation Factor V, multimerin-1, 14-3-3 protein zeta/delta, and \u03b1-actinin 4. These results were confirmed by immunoblotting. Furthermore, the thiol isomerases PDI, ERp5, ERp57, and ERp72 were all found to bind specifically to mastoparan as confirmed by immunoblotting. We conclude that mastoparan affinity chromatography identified a number of proteins in platelet releasates that may contribute to shear-induced TGF-\u03b21 activation.
