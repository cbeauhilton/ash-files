    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4005 The CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 is progressively replacing cyclophosphamide as adjuvant to G-CSF to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) for autologous transplants in patients who failed prior mobilization with G-CSF alone. We and others have recently demonstrated that G-CSF-induced mobilization and the associated response of HSC niches and bone formation depend on bone marrow (BM) macrophages 1\u20133 . Moreover medullar B lymphopoiesis is dependent on bone-forming osteoblasts in vivo. We therefore compared the effects of these three mobilizing agents (6 day course of G-CSF, versus a single injection of cyclophosphamide, versus 6 day course of AMD3100) on endosteal osteoblasts, bone formation, BM macrophages, expression of HSC-supportive cytokines and B lymphopoiesis in the mouse. G-CSF administration significantly reduced the number of endosteal osteoblasts and niche-supporting macrophages. G-CSF also inhibited expression of chemokines and cytokines such as CXCL12, Kit-ligand, angiopoietin-1 and IL-7 in the endosteal region resulting in a profound inhibition of medullar B lymphopoiesis with suppression of pre-pro-B, pro-B, pre-B cells and mature sIgM+ B cells as long as G-CSF was administered and HSC mobilization persisted. Cyclophosphamide also suppressed osteoblasts, niche-supportive macrophages and inhibited endosteal expression of CXCL12 and angiopoietin-1 but did not inhibit KIT-ligand expression. Of note, the down-regulation of CXL12 was more pronounced in response to cyclophosphamide than G-CSF. This could explain the higher mobilizing effect of cyclophosphamide. In contrast to G-CSF, medullar B lymphopoiesis rebounded in synchrony with endosteal IL-7 expression during cyclophosphamide-induced mobilization despite persistent suppression of osteoblasts and bone formation. Despite a marked rebound in the number of immature B cell progenitors in cyclophosphamide-mobilized BM, B cell progenitors could not mature into sIgM+ B cells which remained very depressed in BM, spleen and blood even 10 days after a single cyclophosphamide injection. Finally, while AMD3100 was effective at mobilizing HSC, it did not suppress osteoblasts, cytokine expression at the endosteum or B lymphopoiesis. In conclusion, although G-CSF, cyclophosphamide and AMD3100 efficiently mobilize HSC into the blood, their effects on HSC niches, bone formation and B lymphopoiesis are distinct. Furthermore the contrasted effects of G-CSF, cyclophosphamide and AMD3100 on medullar B lymphopoiesis indicates that grafts mobilized with these three agents may have different immune properties.
