    "abstract_text": "In hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (HAA), bone marrow failure follows an acute attack of seronegative hepatitis. Aplastic anemia (AA) is also associated with orthotopic liver transplantation for non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis in young patients. Although the etiology of HAA is unknown, a clinical response to immunosuppressive therapy is observed in most clinical cases. The liver is the potential initial target organ of the immune response. We have previously determined the T-cell repertoire in the liver and peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients with HAA (Lu et al. Blood. 2004 Jun 15;103(12):4588\u201393). An antigen-driven T-cell expansion was implicated in the acute stage before bone marrow failure. In the present study, we measured serum cytokine levels in 22 HAA serum samples. Only interleukin (IL)-10 levels showed a significant increase compared to healthy controls (p0.05), confirming the important role of cellular immunity in HAA. IFN-\u03b3 transcripts were significantly overexpressed in both HAA and FH samples compared to hepatitis B/C samples (p0.05). In summary, our data confirm that enhanced cellular immunity (increased IFN-\u03b3 level) is implicated in the pathogenesis of HAA, similar to that observed in the bone marrow of idiopathic AA, and in contrast to other liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis B/C. Quantitation of IFN-\u03b3 levels in acute hepatitis samples might be a predictive marker for the development of bone marrow failure after liver transplantation following seronegative hepatitis and FH."
