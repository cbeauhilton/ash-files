    "abstract_text": "Abstract 669 Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the Western world but its pathogenesis remains largely unknown. More recently, a widely prevalent premalignant condition termed monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) has been defined and similarly involves expansion of a CD19+CD5+ population of B cells. MBL has been the focus of a wide number of recent studies in hopes it can provide insight into the early pathological events that lead to clonal expansion of a pre-leukemic CLL-like clone. Previously, we and others identified the transcription factor lymphocyte enhancer-binding factor-1 ( LEF-1 ) as one of several genes significantly over expressed in CLL B cells relative to blood CD19+ B cells from healthy adults. LEF-1 is crucial for the proliferation and survival of pro-B cells during B cell development and deregulated LEF-1 activation has been directly linked with leukemogenesis in a transgenic murine model. In the present study, we addressed three critical questions concerning LEF-1 and CLL: 1) do CD5+ normal B cells express LEF-1; 2) at what stage of transformation does LEF-1 expression first appear; and 3) what mechanism(s) underlies LEF-1 expression in leukemic B cells. Methodology: The goals of our study were to: 1) determine the LEF-1 expression status of normal CD 19+/CD5+ human B cells; 2) determine the expression status of LEF-1 in clonal B cells present in patients with MBL; and 3) identify regulatory mechanisms that control aberrant expression of LEF-1 in CLL B cells. In order to achieve the first two goals, a 3-color flow cytometry assay for CD19, CD5, and intracellular LEF-1 was developed. To achieve the third goal, we performed in silico analysis of the LEF-1 locus and correlated this with publicly available genome wide methylated CpG island recovery assay (MIRA) data describing the methylome of normal human B cells (Rauch, T. A. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A . 2009; 106(3): 671-8). Results: Analysis of human umbilical cord blood B cells, a rich source of the CD19+/CD5+ B cell subset, revealed that all normal CD 19+/CD5+ human B cells are negative for LEF-1 protein expression. These data demonstrate LEF-1 expression by CLL B cells is truly aberrant and does not simply reflect the phenotype of CD5+ lineage B cells. We next tested if the CD19+/CD5+ cells obtained from patients with MBL express LEF-1 protein. In these analyses, we restricted our study to MBL patients with absolute B cell counts of less than 2.5 \u00d710\u20029 cells/(L) (range: 0.756 - 2.44 \u00d7 10\u20029 cells/(L)), which is significantly below the upper limit that defines the MBL to CLL transition. Of interest, each MBL sample analyzed (n=6) revealed the presence of two populations of cells: 1) CD19+/CD5+ B cells expressing LEF-1; and 2) CD19+/CD5- B cells lacking expression of LEF-1. To confirm the clonal nature of the CD19+/CD5+ cells from MBL patients we demonstrated that the cells were light chain restricted. These data clearly indicated that LEF-1 expression becomes deregulated in the premalignant state of MBL and may therefore represent an early event in CLL leukemogenesis. In order to identify differential pathways of LEF-1 regulation that may be altered in CLL and MBL B cells, in silico promoter analysis of LEF-1 was performed. We identified a number of potential transcription factor binding sites as well as a putative CpG island in the 5' promoter region of LEF-1. Using data from a human B cell genome wide methylation array, we were able to determine that this same putative LEF-1 promoter CpG island was highly methylated in normal human B cells. Methylation of promoter region CpG islands is known to play an important role in developmental regulation of gene expression and may be the operative mechanism underlying silencing of LEF-1 expression in normal B cells. Conclusions: LEF-1 expression is deregulated in MBL and appears to be an early and possibly key event in the transition of normal B cells into a premalignant/malignant state. Our data suggest that loss of epigenetic regulation of this developmentally important locus may play a role in aberrant LEF-1 expression in MBL and CLL B cells. Ongoing studies are aimed at determining the methylation status of the LEF-1 promoter in CLL B cells and the functional role of this protein in transcriptional regulation and survival of CLL and MBL cells.
