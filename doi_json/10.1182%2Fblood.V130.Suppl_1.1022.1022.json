    "abstract_text": "The integrins \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23 on circulating platelets are maintained in inactive states by an intra-molecular clasp involving the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and extracellular stalk domains of their \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. Following platelet stimulation, \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23 rapidly undergo global rearrangements in which their clasps are disrupted and their headpieces open to expose a ligand binding site. Protein-protein interfaces, such as those of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23 clasps, are usually large complementary surfaces in which specific amino acids, termed energetic \"hot spots\", contribute disproportionately to the binding free energy. Previously, we scanned the \u03b23 EGF-3, EGF-4, and \u03b2TD domains computationally with alanine residues and identified a limited number of interface residues that stabilized the extracellular clasps of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23. Here, we have used computational alanine scanning to identify corresponding \"hot spots\" in the Calf-1 and Calf-2 domains of the \u03b1IIb and \u03b1v components of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23 clasps. The identified alanine substitutions were predicted to destabilize the respective stalk heterodimers. We identified 10 \u03b1IIb substitutions and 11 \u03b1v substitutions that would destabilize the stalk interfaces by a change in binding free energy (\u0394\u0394G) of >0.3 kcal/mol. To confirm that a \u0394\u0394G as small as 0.3 kcal/mol is sufficient to destabilize the \u03b23 integrin stalk interfaces, we introduced 8 of the 10 \u03b1IIb substitutions into full-length \u03b1IIb, co-expressed the mutated \u03b1IIb with wild type \u03b23 in CHO cells, and measured spontaneous binding of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled fibrinogen to the cells by flow cytometry. \u03b1IIbR751A\u03b23 did not express, implying that R751 is important for correct \u03b1IIb folding and/or \u03b1IIb\u03b23 assembly. Each of the other mutations expressed and caused constitutive \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation. Importantly, \u03b1IIb\u03b23 containing alanine substitutions whose effect on \u0394\u0394G was <0.3 kcal/mol was inactive. Nonetheless, while the alanine scanning algorithm correctly identified destabilizing alanine substitutions, it did not correctly rank their functional effects. Hot spots could occur because they bury specific side chains in the protein-protein interface. While we found a modest correlation between \u0394\u0394G and the buried surface area of specific \u03b1IIb side chains (R 2 =0.7), there was no correlation with \u03b1v (R 2 =0.1), a result consistent with an analysis of a compiled database of 2325 similar alanine mutants (Bogan and Thorn, J Mol Biol 280:1-9,1998). This suggests that other mechanisms, such as inter-subunit hydrogen bonds, are involved. Previously, in studies of the growth hormone-growth hormone receptor complex, Clackson and Wells ( Science 267:383-86,1995) found that functionally important residues in the interface of the complex were in direct contact. To determine if this is the case for \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23, we mapped the mutation-sensitive positions onto the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23 crystal structures to localize the \u03b1IIb, \u03b1v, and \u03b23 hot spots in models of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23 stalks. The energetic hot spots we identified in \u03b1IIb and \u03b1v were located in a strip along one face of the Calf-1 and Calf-2 domains. Similarly, the \u03b23 hot spots were located in a strip along on one face of the EGF-3, EGF-4, and \u03b2TD domains. However, the hot spots were not contiguous and there was only partial overlap of the \u03b23 side chains that interacted with \u03b1IIb versus \u03b1v. On the other hand, in models of the assembled stalk heterodimers, there was remarkable complementarity of the computationally identified hot spots in the \u03b1IIb and \u03b1v stalks with those in \u03b23, indicating that only a limited number of specific inter-subunit interactions actually make significant contributions to stalk assembly. These results confirm the utility of computational alanine scanning for identifying and localizing functionally important interaction sites in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b23. They also demonstrate that although the same surface of \u03b23 interacts with the \u03b1IIb and \u03b1v stalks, unique, as well as overlapping, side chain interactions are responsible for maintaining the inactive state of the respective integrins. They also suggest that stabilizing the extracellular stalk heterodimers may be a way to attenuate \u03b23 integrin activation. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
