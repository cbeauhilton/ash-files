    "article_date": "November 16, 2004",
    "session_type": "Poster Sessions",
    "abstract_text": "In this study, Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) were obtained from bone marrow of 10 patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), six M0/1 two M2, and two M5 (according to the FAB classification), 8 out of 10 in post-chemotherapy complete remission. These cells differentiated into adipocytes or osteoblasts under appropriate culture conditions. MSC were CD44+, CD73a+ CD73b+ CD105+, beta1 integrin+, ICAM1+, HLA-I+, HLA-II+ (variable proportions), CD45\u2212, CD31\u2212, CD34\u2212 and they constitutively expressed the stress-inducible MHC-related molecules MIC-A and the UL16 (induced at the surface of cells infected by cytomegalovirus) binding protein ULBP3. These molecules are reported ligands for the NKG2D receptor expressed by natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T lymphocytes, effector cells that are thought to play a role in host defence against tumors. NK cells have also been shown to regulate normal differentiation of hemopoietic precursor into the myeloid or lymphoid cell lineage. Moreover, it has been stated that NK cells are not able to damage autologous cells, as they receive negative signals through inhibitory receptors, including killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) or C-type lectin inhibitory receptors (CLIR), which bind to HLA-I discrete alleles. Surprisingly, we found that autologous IL2-activated, but not freshly isolated, NK cells lysed MSC, while T lymphocytes did not kill self or non-self MSC. Binding of ICAM-1 expressed by MSC to its receptor, the integrin LFA-1, expressed by NK cells plays a key role in MSC/NK interaction. More importantly, NKG2D/MICA and/or NKG2D/ULBP3 engagement is responsible for the delivery of lethal hit. Conversely, it appears that HLA-I molecules do not protect MSC from NK cell-mediated injury. Taken together, these data suggest that NK cells, when activated as it may occur during the first response to viral infections, are able to eliminate MSC, thus altering the normal interactions with hemopoietic precursors and possibly affecting their differentiation. This mechanism might also contribute to the development of aberrant precursors as observed in acute leukaemias.",
