    "abstract_text": "Introduction: MYC rearrangement in high-grade B-cell NHL(non-burkitt), either as single hit or double hit, has significant prognostic and therapeutic implications. There is remarkable paucity of data on frequency and clinico-pathological features of MYC-rearranged large B-cell lymphomas from developing world. Method: This study included de-novo high grade B-cell NHL cases (>15 years of age) registered at Tata Memorial Centre between January 2013- December 2014. Demography details, clinical features (stage at presentation, bone marrow involvement, presence and extent of extranodal involvement, B-symptoms, international prognostic index),original histopathological diagnosis, chemotherapy and radiotherapy details were recorded from electronic medical or paper case records. Response to therapy, relapses or death if any, status at last follow up, dates of relapse and/or death and last follow up were recorded. All cases were reviewed by expert hematopathologists to categorize the high grade B-cell NHL as per the WHO-2008 classification of hematopoietic malignancies. All cases with adequate formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks were evaluated by FISH for c-MYC , BCl-2 and BCl-6 using Vysis dual colour break apart probes. Cases which showed >10% cells with split signal were considered to harbor rearrangement. Result: A total of 114 cases of de-novo high-grade B-cell NHL with adequate FFPE blocks were evaluated. Based on WHO 2008 classification, 112 cases were classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL)) and 1 each as Burkitt's (BL) and B- cell lymphoma unclassifiable -intermediate between DLBL and BL(BCLU). A total of 9/112 (8%) cases of DLBL showed MYC rearrangement. One of these 9 cases had both MYC and BCl-2 rearrangement. BCLU did not demonstrate MYC or BCl-2 rearrangement. The Ki-67 index was variable (40-95%)in MYC rearranged cases. The median age of the c-MYC rearranged cases was 55 year (range-23-79 years). 88% were males. Advanced stage disease, bulky mass and extranodal disease was seen in 67%, 44% and 55% of cases respectively. All but one patient had high LDH, however none of the patients had elevation more than 2XULN. These patients received rituximab based chemoimmunotherapy (RCHOP-4,RCEOP-4, REPOCH-1) and 77% achieved complete response. At median follow up of 5 months, 1 year-overall survival and progression free survivals were 80% and 75% respectively. There were no significant differences in clinical features (except higher proportion of males in the c-MYC rearranged subset), LDH levels, ki-67 index , response to therapy and survival between DLBL with or without c-MYC rearrangement Conclusion: In our study 8% of all DLBL cases showed c-MYC rearrangement. The frequency of double hit lymphoma was less than 1% (0.8%). Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
