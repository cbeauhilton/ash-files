    "abstract_text": "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) seems to result in activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. We characterised the outcome of SCT and graft versus host disease (GvHD) in association with the adaptive mechanisms of coagulation and fibrinolysis. 30 patients given myeloablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation underwent allogeneic SCT for a hematological malignancy. 19 patients received the transplant from a sibling and 11 from an unrelated donor. GvHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate, and in addition methylprednisolone in case of a sibling donor. Eight patients developed GvHD during the 3-month follow-up. Several coagulation and fibrinolysis activities were serially assessed: antithrombin, protein C (PC), FVIII, prothrombin fragments 1+2 (F1+2), D-dimer, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). During the conditioning therapy as an early sign of thrombin generation, F1+2 increased 3-fold and D-dimer 4-fold, compatible with enhanced fibrin turnover. The activity of tPA reached its maximum already before the engraftment and that of PAI-1 diminished accordingly. FVIII increased steadily from normal to reach maximum (up to 273% \u00b1104%, median \u00b1SD, p10 U/ml) predicted the non-relapse mortality (p=0.013). In conclusion, early activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis is followed by increased FVIII and PC activities in SCT. Early marked thrombin generation and elevated PAI-1 associated with the non-relapse mortality and low PC activity with the appearance of acute GvHD.",
