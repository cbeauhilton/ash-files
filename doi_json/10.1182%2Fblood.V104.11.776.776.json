    "abstract_text": "GABP is an ets transcription factor that regulates transcription of key myeloid genes, including CD18 (beta2 leukocyte integrin), neutrophil elastase, lysozyme, and other key mediators of the inflammatory response; it is also known to regulate important cell cycle control genes. GABP consists of two distinct and unrelated proteins that, together, form a functional transcription factor complex. GABPalpha (GABPa) is an ets protein that binds to DNA; it forms a tetrameric complex by recruiting its partner, GABPbeta (GABPb), which contains the transactivation domain. GABPa is a single copy gene in both the human and murine genomes and it is the only protein that can recruit GABPb to DNA. We cloned GABPa from a murine genomic BAC library and prepared a targeting vector in which exon 9 (which encodes the GABPa ets domain) was flanked by loxP (floxed) recombination sites. The targeting construct was electroporated into embryonic stem cells, homologous recombinants were implanted into pseudopregnant mice, heterozygous floxed GABPa mice were identified, and intercrossing yielded expected Mendelian ratios of wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous floxed GABPa mice. Breeding of heterozygous floxed GABPa mice to CMV-Cre mice (which express Cre recombinase in all tissues) yielded expected numbers of hemizygous mice (only one intact GABPa allele), but no nullizygous (GABPa\u2212/\u2212) mice among 64 pups; we conclude that homozygous deletion of GABPa causes an embryonic lethal defect. To determine the effect of GABPa deletion on myeloid cell development, we bred heterozygous and homozygous floxed mice to LysMCre mice, which express Cre only in myeloid cells. These mice had a normal complement of myeloid cells but, unexpectedly, PCR indicated that their Gr1+ myeloid cells retained an intact (undeleted) floxed GABPa allele. We detected similar numbers of in vitro myeloid colonies from bone marrow of wild type, heterozygous floxed, and homozygous floxed progeny of LysMCre matings. However, PCR of twenty individual in vitro colonies from homozygous floxed mice indicated that they all retained an intact floxed allele. Breeding of floxed GABPa/LysMCre mice with hemizygous mice indicated that retention of a floxed allele was not due to incomplete deletion by LysMCre; rather, it appears that only myeloid cells that retain an intact GABPa allele can survive to mature in vitro or in vivo. We prepared murine embryonic fibroblasts from homozygous floxed mice and efficiently deleted GABPa in vitro. We found striking abnormalities in proliferation and G1/S phase arrest. We used quantitative RT-PCR to identify mechanisms that account for the altered growth of GABPa null cells. We found dramatically reduced expression of known GABP target genes that regulate DNA synthesis and cell cycle that appear to account for the proliferative defect. We conclude that GABPa is required for growth and maturation of myeloid cells and we identified downstream targets that may account for their failure to proliferate and mature in vitro and in vivo.",
