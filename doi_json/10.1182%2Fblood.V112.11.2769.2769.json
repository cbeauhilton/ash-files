    "abstract_text": "Melphalan (M), Prednisone (P) and Lenalidomide (R) are active in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). We evaluated the toxicity and efficacy of MPR in a phase I/II trial. Results of phase I part were previously reported ( Blood  2006 , 108 (11) abst 3558 ). M 5 mg/m 2 on days (d) 1\u20134, 60 mg/m 2 d 1\u20134 and R 10 mg d 1\u201321 of a 28 day cycle was determined as MTD for the phase II study. Methods : Patients with previously untreated MM who were not candidates for stem cell transplantation, age \u226518 yr, ECOG PS 0\u20133, evaluable or measurable disease, ANC >1500, platelets > 100,000 and creatinine \u2264 3.0 mg/dL were eligible. All patients received aspirin 325 mg/d as DVT prophylaxis. Routine antibacterial prophylaxis was not used. G/GM-CSF was used at the discretion of the treating physician for neutropenia. Response rate (RR), confirmed on two consecutive determinations was the primary end-point. The study had 90% power to detect a RR of at least 45%. Results : Twenty-six patients were accrued between July \u201906 and Feb \u201908. The median age was 74 y (64 \u2013 87y), 17 (65%) were men. Six, 13, 6, 1 (23%, 50%, 23%, and 4%) patients had ECOG PS 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Three (12%), 11 (42%) and 10 (38%) patients were ISS stage 1, 2 and 3. A total of 106 cycles were administered; median 4.5 (1\u201313). Seventy-seven % patients experienced at least 1 grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Neutropenia (42%/8%) and thrombocytopenia (20%/8%) were the most common grade 3/4 adverse events followed by anemia (16%/0%), fatigue (8%/4%), rash (11%/0%), and hyperglycemia (4%/0%). There were 20 treatment delays in 9 patients, and 18 dose reductions (9 in R, 11 in M and 1 P) occurred in 7 patients, most commonly because of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Eleven patients (42%) required G-CSF treatment. Eleven patients are currently receiving treatment; 15 have gone off study (4 completed per protocol, 3 refused, 3 adverse effects, 3 unrelated illnesses, 2 other). Median follow up of survivors is 8 m (0 \u2013 22m). Eighteen (69 %; 95%CI 48\u201386) patients had a PR or better according to International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response criteria; 3 (12 %) CR, 5 (19 %) VGPR and 10 (38%) PR. Median number of cycles before achieving a response was 2 (1 \u2013 11). Median Progression Free and Overall Survival is 16.7m (95% CI 11.2\u201323.0), and 23 m (95% CI: 22 \u2013 23), respectively. Conclusions : MPR combination is feasible with a manageable toxicity profile and has significant activity in the treatment of patients with MM who are not candidates for stem cell transplant, with an overall response rate of 69%, and a CR plus VGPR rate of 31%. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was the most common toxicity, seen in up to 50% of patients in this cohort of predominantly elderly patients. Dose reduction in R and/or M was required in 27% patients. No patient developed neuropathy or thromboembolic complications.",
