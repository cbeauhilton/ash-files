    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4910 The Kindlin family of intracellular proteins has recently emerged as key regulators of cellular functions and cell-matrix interactions. They comprise of three evolutionarily conserved members, kindlin-1, kindlin-2 and kindlin-3, they share considerable sequence and structural similarities. A few of study revealed that Kindlin-2 influences solid tumor cell invasion and resistance. With regard to AML, the influence of Kindlins is still unknown. To evaluate the clinical significance of Kindlin-2 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we investigated the expression of Kindlin-2, kindling-3 in AML cells. 1. Materials and methods K562, KG-1a, HL60, U937, Jurkat cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Bone marrow (BM) samples were obtained from 88 patients with de novo AML from Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC). Samples of 9 normal donors and ITP were used as the control group. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were prepared by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. Expressions of Kindlin-2, Kindlin-3 were detected by RQ-PCR. The following primers for real-time PCR were used: (a) Kindlin-2 sense primer, 5'-CCGCTCGAGCTATGCGTATCCCCGTAG-3'; (b) Kindlin-2 antisense primer, 5'-CGACGCGTCTAGCGAGGGGTTGTC-3'; (c) Kindlin-3 sense primer, 5'-CCGCTCGAGCTATGCGTATCCCCGTAG-3'; (d) Kindlin-3 antisense primer, 5'-CGACGCGTCTAGCGAGGGGTTGTC-3'; (e) GAPDH sense primer, 5'-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3'; (f) GAPDH antisense primer, 5'-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3'. Analysis was performed using ABI 7500 Sequence Detection software (Applied Biosystems). The expression of Kindlin-2 and Kindlin-3 were showed as RQ value calculated through \u0394\u0394Ct method [\u0394\u0394Ct = (Ct Kindlin \u25a1 Ct GAPDH )sample \u25a1 (Ct Kindlin \u25a1 Ct GAPDH )calibrator]. The \u0394Ct (Ct Kindlin \u25a1 Ct GAPDH ) of K562 was defined as calibrator, and the RQ of calibrator was 1.000. Relationships between Kindlin-2, Kindlin-3 and the patients' clinical data were analyzed. 2. Results Expression of Kindlins in newly diagnosis AML Table 1.

No significant difference was found between the AML and controls in levels of Kindlin-3 ( p =0.216). Out of the 79 patients who accepted treatment, 61 patients achieved complete remission (CR) and 18 patients were NR. Patients with higher expression of Kindlin-2 had a higher CR rate (86.8% vs 68.3%) ( p =0.050). Expression of kindling 3 was unrelated to CR rate. Both of kindling-2 and kindling-3 increased after CR. This finding implicates Kindlin-2 as a potential prognostic factor of AML. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
