    "abstract_text": "Results to date argue compellingly that disruption of FA/BRCA gene expression plays a pivotal role in human somatic carcinogenesis. Melphalan, a DNA cross-linker, is one of the most widely used and effective drugs in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Although most patients respond to standard and high dose melphalan, eventually patients acquire resistance and develop progressive disease. In 1991, our laboratory reported that acquired resistance in a human myeloma cell line was associated with reduced DNA crosslinks, elevated glutathione levels, and increased radiation survival ( Cancer Res. 5:993; 1991 ). Most recently, we reported that the melphalan-resistant myeloma cell lines, 8226/LR5 and U266/LR6, showed a significant increase in several FA/BRCA genes compared to drug-sensitive cells, and that enhanced interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair via this signaling pathway contributes to acquired drug resistance in melphalan resistant cell lines ( Blood 10:698; 2005 ). Here, we report that IKKa is constitutively phosphorylated in unstimulated 8226/LR5 cells, but not in melphalan-sensitive control cells. The specific phosphorylation of IKKa leads to an increase in basal NF-kB DNA binding activity, and 8226/LR5 cells are found to be markedly sensitive to BMS-345541 (a highly selective inhibitor of IkB) relative to control cells. Importantly, a cytotoxic dose of BMS-345541 induces a dramatic decrease in FA/BRCA gene expression, and a concomitant inhibition of NF-kB DNA binding activity in both 8226/S and 8226/LR5 cells. Furthermore, we show that 8226/LR5 cells experience the highest degree of direct binding between FANCD2 promoter and NF-kB/Rel family members, which, in turn, leads to an increase in basal FANCD2-specific NF-kB activity. Small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of RelB and p50, but not other NF-kB subunits, in 8226 cells results in impaired NF-kB binding activity, and visible decrease in FANCD2 protein expression. Studies designed to dissect the role of NF-kB in acquired melphalan resistance are in progress, and the results will be presented. Our findings suggest that NF-kB functions as a regulator of FA/BRCA expression, and that this pathway represents a new target for preventing acquired drug resistance in myeloma patients.",
