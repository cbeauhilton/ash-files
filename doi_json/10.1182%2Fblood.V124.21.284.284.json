    "abstract_text": "Background and hypothesis: Like mature B cell lymphoma, pre-B ALL originates from B cell precursors that critically depend on survival signals emanating from a functional (pre-) B cell receptor (BCR). While recent work successfully introduced BCR signaling inhibitors into patient care for various subtypes of mature B cell lymphoma, it is not known whether pre-BCR signaling represents a therapeutic target in pre-B ALL and in which cytogenetic subsets targeting of pre-BCR signaling will be effective. In this study we demonstrated that ALL can be subdivided into two groups that fundamentally differ with respect to pre-BCR signalling. We identified a novel mechanism of self-enforcing feedback activation between the transcription factor BCL6 and tonic pre-BCR signaling in pre-BCR + ALL and proposed a dual targeting strategy of both BCL6 and pre-BCR related tyrosine kinases for the treatment of patients with pre-BCR + ALL. Results: Flow cytometry analysis of surface pre-BCR expression ( \u03bb 5, VpreB), cytoplasmic \u03bc heavy chain (\u03bcHC) expression and intracellular Ca 2+ signal in 29 patient-derived pre-B ALL xenograft samples and cell lines showed pre-BCR expression and activity in a subset of pre-B ALL, including all TCF3-PBX1 cases studied (n=4) and two cases with deletions at 6q21. Studying 830 pre-B ALL cases from four clinical trials (MDACC, St. Jude, COG P9906 and ECOG E2993), tonic pre-BCR signaling and constitutive PI3K-AKT activation was found in 112 cases (13.5%), including 93% TCF3-PBX1 (53 of 57), del (6)(q21) (7 of 7), PBX1 (1q23) duplication (4 of 4), MLL -rearrangement (3 of 86), hyperdiploid (2 of 43) and other (43 of 406) pre-B ALL cases. In other major ALL subtypes, we found no evidence for pre-BCR expression and activity, including BCR-ABL1 (0 of 196) and ETV6-RUNX1 (0 of 31). We found frequent 1q23 ( PBX1 ) duplication, TCF3-PBX1 or other PBX1 -rearrangement, 6q21 ( PRDM1 ) deletion in ALL cells with tonic pre-BCR signaling. Development of a genetic mouse model for inducible ablation of Bcl6 . Pre-BCR-induced activation of BCL6 relieves PRDM1-mediated repression of pre-BCR signaling components and positively regulates pre-BCR signaling output at the transcriptional level. The clinical data (COG P9906, ECOG E2993) revealed that high mRNA levels of BCL6 at the time of diagnosis is predictive of poor clinical outcome specifically in patients with pre-BCR + ALL but not ALL cells lacking pre-BCR expression. These findings suggest an important role of BCL6 as a cofactor of pre-BCR signaling in a large subset of ALL. To directly test the role of Bcl6- and pre-BCR interactions, we generated a novel mouse model for inducible Cre-mediated deletion of Bcl6 exons 5-10, flanked by loxP sites. For lineage-specific deletion in vivo, we crossed these mice with an Mb1 -Cre deleter strain, in which Bcl6 was deleted in pro-B cells, resulting in a differentiation block at the pre-B cell stage. Deletion of Bcl6 in mouse pre-BCR + ALL and expression of a dominate-negative form of BCL6 in human primary pre-BCR + ALL cells, both rapidly induced cell death, indicating BCL6 cooperates with the pre-BCR in leukemic transformation. Cooperation between pre-BCR and BCL6 signaling. Inhibition of BCL6 via the specific BCL6 inhibitor RI-BPI showed compromised colony formation and induced cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, constitutive BCL6 expression was sensitive to inhibition of SYK and SRC tyrosine kinases downstream of the pre-BCR. Treating 6 pre-BCR + and 8 pre-BCR- patient-derived ALL samples with the SYK inhibitor (PRT06207), BTK inhibitor (Ibrutinib) or a broader SRC and BTK inhibitor Dasatinib, we observed remarkably decreased BCL6 expression and increased apoptosis in pre-BCR + but not pre-BCR - ALL cells. In vivo treatments with Dasatinib prevented leukemia initiation and significantly prolonged survival of the recipient mice that were injected with primary pre-BCR + ALL cells, compared to non-treatment or Nilotinib-treatment. These data demonstrate that both inhibition of BCL6 and pre-BCR signaling selectively killed patient-derived pre-BCR + ALL cells. Conclusions : Our study identified two distinct subtypes of pre-B ALL that fundamentally differ with respect to pre-BCR signaling. Tonic pre-BCR signaling engages a BCL6-dependent, self-enforcing amplification loop. Based on these findings, we propose a dual targeting strategy of BCL6 and pre-BCR tyrosine kinases for the treatment of patients with pre-BCR + ALL.
