    "abstract_text": "Background: The entrance of microbes into blood stream results in rapid spreading of infection through circulation system progressing to sepsis with accompanying fever, leukocytosis and circulatory collapse necessitating prompt recognition and treatment. We calculated the difference between white blood cell counts measured in myeloperoxidase and basophil channel, designated as \u201cdelta neutrophil\u201d, and found that the value correlates the progression of sepsis. Methods: We categorized patients who were referred for automatic blood cell analysis according to the calculated value of delta neutrophil and analyzed positive rate of blood culture, mortality and laboratory data including hemoglobin, platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, fibrinogen degradation product, D-dimer, ESR, CRP. Delta neutrophil values were calculated as above mentioned from measured values from automatic blood cell analyzer, ADVIA \u00ae 120 automated Hematology System (Bayer Diagnostics, New York, USA). Among 1781 patients selected, those with delta neutrophil value less then 5 were categorized as group I, 5 to 10 as group II, 10 to 20 group III, 20 to 30 group IV, 30 to 40 group V, 40 to 50 group VI and greater than 50 as group VII, arbitrarily. Patients with hematologic malignancy or with Gynecologic malignancy were excluded in this study. Results: The mortality and blood culture rate in group VII were 75.0% and 57.1% and in group VI 76% and 46.7%, group V 46.2% and 37.9%, respectively. On the contrary for group I the mortality and isolation rate were 3.3% and 17.1%. (The means of hemoglobin concentration for group I and II were 13.2 g/dL and 12.1 g/dL compared with 10.5 g/dL and 10.2 g/dL in group VI and VII.) With regard to consumptive coagulopathy, the means of platelet count were 263,700/mL and 259,200/mL in group I and II while those for group VI and VII were 107,200/mL and 112,600/mL. Antithrombin activities were 5.20 % and 7.98% in group VII and VI in contrast to 66.6% and 75.8% for group I and II. Conclusion: The categorization by delta neutrophil value correlated with the isolation rate of bacteria from blood culture and mortality. The delta neutrophil value is expected to provide useful information for following up progression of sepsis."
