    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3289 In this study we assess platelet receptor expression and shedding in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) before and during treatment. The aim is to evaluate the potential value of quantitative measurement of platelet receptors for diagnosis and/or monitoring treatment in thrombocytopenia due to immune or other causes. The platelet-specific collagen receptor, glycoprotein (GP)VI, is associated with the Fc receptor \u03b3-chain (FcR\u03b3). GPVI/FcR\u03b3 is coassociated on platelet surface with the GPIb-IX-V complex; GPIb\u03b1 of GPIb-IX-V binds von Willebrand factor and other ligands. Our previous studies showed engagement of platelet Fc\u03b3RIIa by antiplatelet antibodies induced ectodomain shedding of GPVI, generating soluble ectodomain (sGPVI) in plasma. However, apart from one individual with an anti-GPVI antibody, whether anti-platelet antibodies associated with ITP affect GPVI/GPIb expression/shedding has not been addressed. In this study we used flow cytometry and a sGPVI ELISA to assess 1) whether patients with ITP had dysregulated expression/shedding of GPVI or GPIb\u03b1, and 2) whether platelet receptor expression changes prior to recovery of platelet count in individuals undergoing treatment for ITP. In 9 ITP patients (mean age=48.6, range 29\u201379; 6 female) with platelet count 61\u00b19 \u00d7 10 9 /L (range, 33\u2013122 \u00d7 10 9 /L), GPVI surface expression (GeoMean\u00b1SE, 137\u00b117) was lower than healthy controls (274\u00b126; n =17; platelet count 247\u00b113), and sGPVI in patient plasma was significantly higher (39\u00b14 ng/mL) compared to 17 healthy donors (19\u00b13 ng/mL) ( P =0.0006). In longitudinal samples analysed at weekly intervals during 2-month treatment with steroids, decreased GPVI surface expression and increased sGPVI in plasma remained essentially unchanged as the platelet count normalized, consistent with persistent anti-platelet antibody. However, while levels of intact platelet GPIb\u03b1 were significantly reduced in ITP compared to healthy donors ( P =0.0053), they approached healthy levels within 1 week of treatment, preceding improvement in platelet count or other measures. GPIb\u03b1 expression/cleavage has been previously implicated in platelet clearance in experimental models, and our analysis suggests the proteolytic status of human GPIb\u03b1 may be a novel early marker for evaluating response to treatment in ITP.
