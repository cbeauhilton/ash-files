    "abstract_text": "Autoimmune disorders (AIDs) are commonly observed in up to 30% of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients. Clinical manifestations such as acute neutrophilic febrile dermatosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, pulmonary infiltrates and peripheral polyneuropathy, precede or accompany the diagnosis of MDS. In fact, large-scale epidemiologic studies have suggested that patients with AIDs have an elevated risk of developing MDS. To gain more insight into the association of MDS and AIDs, bone marrow mononuclear cells available from 202 patients were sequenced for 'inflammsome' pathway genes NLRP3 and MYD88, which have been shown to carry mutations in various AIDs. According to WHO classification, the patient cohort included 49% RA/RARS/RCMD, 24% RAEB, 6% 5q syndrome, 10% AML, 6% MPD/MDS and 5% tMDS. Median age of the cohort was 62 years (IQR 54.8-62.3). Autoimmune data was available on 129 patients and 49/129 patients had evidence of AID. 31 patients were diagnosed with MDS-associated 'Sweets Syndrome' AID. Myeloid neoplasm-related 22 gene panel mutation data was available for 171 patients. Initially all protein coding exons of NLRP3 and MYD88 genes were sequenced in 31 cases diagnosed with MDS-Sweets syndrome. Targeted sequencing (Miseq, Illumina) revealed NLRP3 variants in 6/31 cases. NLRP3 heterozygous variants detected were V200M (n=1/31, 3%), Q705K (n=4/31, 13%) and T954M (n=1/31, 3%). Two of these variants (V200M and Q705K) have been previously described as pathogenic and linked with various autoimmune disorders 1,2 . Variant T954M is reported in COSMIC v73 database as a confirmed somatic mutation. The frequency of these variants in general European population (NHLBI ESP 2015) varies in-between 0.6% to 5% (V200, rs121908147 MAF= 0.7%; Q705, rs35829419 MAF= 5% and T954, MAF= <0.1%). None of the patients sequenced in our study had MYD88 gene mutations. Therefore, we decided to perform targeted amplicon sequencing on three codons (V200, Q705 and T954) of the NLRP3 gene in remainder of the 171 cases. NLRP3 heterozygous variants V200M and Q705K were observed in 2.3% (n=4/171) and 12% (n= 20/171), of the patients screened, respectively. T954M variant was not detected in the follow-up cohort. Sequencing of the paired constitutional DNA (CD3 + lymphocytes/ Skin biopsy), where available (n=10), confirmed that V200M and Q705K are inherited SNPs. The frequency of these NLRP3 variants observed among our study population is marginally higher than previously described in the general European population (Pearson chi-square test, P >0.05) In order to detect the effects of the NLRP3 variant on the inflammasome pathway, we quantified the serum cytokine (IL1\u03b2, IL18, TNF\u03b1 and INF\u03b3) levels using ProcartaPlex Human Cytokine & Chemokine Panel 1A (34 plex, eBioscience) kit in patients with NLRP3 variants (MDS/sweets syndrome, n =3) vs NLRP3 wildtype (MDS-Sweets syndrome, n=5; MDS/non-sweets syndrome, n=2). No difference was observed in the serum cytokine levels between two patient groups. Next, we investigated the mRNA levels of the NLRP3 and other genes that lie downstream of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway (IL1\u03b2, IL18, TNF\u03b1, CASPASE-1 and ING\u03b3). 34 patients ( NLRP3 variant, n= 22 and NLRP3 Wildtype, n= 12) were included in this analysis. An increased trend in the IL18 mRNA levels was observed in patients with NLRP3 variant vs NLRP3 wildtype. In conclusion, our study shows that the NLRP3 variants are enriched in MDS patients with AIDs compared to historical data on the general population. Patients with NLRP3 variants have an increased levels of IL18 mRNA levels. A larger study to explore the inflammasome pathway is needed to define the molecular pathogenesis of the autoimmunity associated with MDS. Identifying the casual genomic variants of AIDs in MDS may provide relevance to development of novel therapeutic strategies. References 1. Verma D, Sarndahl E, Andersson H, et al.
