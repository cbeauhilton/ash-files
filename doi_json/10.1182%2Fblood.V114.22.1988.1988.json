    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1988 Poster Board I-1010 The NF-E2 transcription factor is a heterodimer composed of a large hematopoietic-specific subunit called p45 and widely expressed 18 to 20-kDa small Maf subunits. In MEL (mouse erythroleukemia) cells, a model of erythroid differentiatin, the absence of p45 is inhibiting chemically induced differentiation, including induction of globin genes. In vivo, p45 knockout mice were reported to show splenomegaly, severe thrompocytopenia and mild erythroid abnormalities. Most of the mice die shortly after birth due to haemorrhages. The animals that survive display increased bone, especially in bony sites of hematopoiesis. We confirmed that femurs of p45 deficient mice are filled with bone, thus limiting the space for cells. Hence, we observed a decrease in the number of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow of 3 months old mice. In order to analyze erythroid progenitor populations we performed flow cytometry using the markers Ter119 and CD71. We found that p45 deficient mice have an increased proportion of early erythroid progenitors (proerythroblasts) and a decreased proportion of late stage differentiated red blood cells (orthochromatic erythroblasts and reticulocytes) in the spleen, when compared to wild-type mice. We showed that the liver of p45 knockout adult mice is also becoming a site of red blood cell production. The use of secondary sites, such as the spleen and liver, suggests stress erythropoiesis, likely compensating for the decreased production of red blood cells in bone marrow. In accordance with those observations, we observed about 2 fold increased levels of erythropoietin in the serum of p45 knockout mice.Overall, our data suggest that p45 NF-E2 is required for proper functioning of the erythroid compartment in vivo .
