    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5222 Introduction: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive and rare B-cell lymphoma entity representing around 5\u20138% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in adults. To our knowledge no data is available on the epidemiology of MCL in France. We aimed to describe incidence, survival and main clinical characteristics of MCL in a French population. Methods: Patients diagnosed with MCL were identified in three administrative areas covered by an haematological malignancies registry: the Co\u0302te d'Or (from 1988 to 2008), the Basse-Normandie (from 1997 to 2006) and the Gironde (from 2002 to 2006). Main clinical features and management characteristics were collected. World age-standardised incidence rates, observed survival and relative survival were estimated for the period 2002\u20132006. Results: Mantle cell lymphoma was diagnosed in 213 patients over the whole period. Seventy percent of patients were males. Over the period 2002\u20132006, the age-standardised incidence rate of MCL (per 100,000) was 0.72 in men (n=100) and 0.17 in women (n=35). The median age at diagnosis was 72 years (range: 30\u201392). Late-stage (III-IV) MCL was diagnosed in 81.5% of patients. MCL international prognostic index (MIPI) was lower or equal to intermediate risk in 36% of patients. The median relative survival time was 41 months (95% confidence interval: 38\u201362) and was significantly higher in patients with a low or intermediate MIPI (74 months, CI95%: 53\u201391) than in patients with a high risk (38 months, CI95%: 30\u201349). Treatment included frontline chemotherapy in 85% patients and 54% patients received rituximab. Ten percent of patients participated in a clinical trial. Conclusion: Epidemiological characteristics of MCL in France were quite similar to epidemiological data reported in other industrialized countries. Incidence rates were characterized by a male-to-female ratio of 4:1. Median overall survival was less than 4 years. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
