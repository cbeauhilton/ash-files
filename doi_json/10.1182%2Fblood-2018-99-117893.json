    "abstract_text": "Stem cell self-renewal and lineage specification are highly dynamic and tightly controlled processes that are essential for normal haematopoiesis and are dysregulated in cancer. The X-linked BCL6 Corepressor ( BCOR ) gene encodes a protein that is widely expressed across adult human tissues and is a component of a non-canonical Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). The BCOR gene is recurrently mutated in various malignant and non-malignant blood disorders, and we and others have recently provided experimental evidence that BCOR has cell-context dependent functions in regulating the proliferation, differentiation and survival of haematopoietic cells. To comprehensively examine the role of BCOR in haematopoiesis in vivo we used a conditional mouse model that mimics the truncating mutations observed in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Using stem and progenitor populations isolated ex vivo we comprehensively analysed the role of BCOR in regulating gene expression, modifying chromatin and altering genome architecture. We demonstrate that BCOR has a pivotal role in down-regulating haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) associated transcriptional networks during the transition from multi-potent stem cells to lineage-committed myeloid progenitors. Inactivation of Bcor in HSCs results in expansion of myeloid progenitors and co-operates with oncogenic KrasG12D in the initiation of an aggressive and fully transplantable acute leukaemia. Mechanistically, Bcor regulates a subset of PRC1-target genes including key HSC super-enhancer-linked transcription factors that are normally down-regulated during myeloid differentiation. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to explore the function of Bcor target genes and identified those that are necessary for the proliferation of Bcor mutant leukaemic cells. This study provides a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how BCOR regulates cell fate decisions and contributes to the development of leukaemia.
