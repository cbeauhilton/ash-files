    "abstract_text": "Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is associated with anemia, congenital abnormalities, and cancer. The disease typically presents within the first year of life. Approximately 70% of DBA patients possess a mutations in one of at least 12 ribosomal proteins, with RPS19 and RPL11 being the most prevalent, accounting for over 25% and 5% of cases respectively. Current therapies for DBA have undesirable side effects, including iron overload from repeated transfusions or infections from immunosuppressive drugs and stem cell transplantation. Nemo-like Kinase (NLK) is chronically hyper-activated in RPS19- and RPL11-haploinsufficient murine and human models of DBA, as well as erythroid progenitors from DBA patients. In an RPS19-insufficient human model, genetic silencing of NLK (shRNA) increased erythroid expansion by 2.2 fold, indicating aberrant NLK activation contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease. In an independent, high-throughput kinase inhibitor screen examining progenitor expansion in RPS19-insufficient Kit+ murine cells, a number of compounds were identified that increased progenitor expansion. SB431542 and SD208 are recognized TGF\u03b2 inhibitor compounds, but were the only TGF\u03b2 inhibitors of a panel of 11 that increased progenitor expansion. Both active compounds robustly inhibited NLK activity in vitro and in vivo while the remaining 9 inhibitors had no significant impact on NLK. Both compounds increased erythroid expansion in murine (3.1 and 5.4 fold) and human (3.2 and 6.3 fold) models of DBA with no effect on wild type erythropoiesis (EC50 5 \u00b5M and 0.7 \u00b5M). No further increase in erythroid expansion was observed when NLK expression was silenced by shRNA. Virtually identical results were observed in CD34+ progenitors from 3 DBA patient bone marrow aspirates with 2.3, 1.9 and 2.1 fold increases in CD235+ erythroblast generation compared to untreated. NLK hyperactivation was limited to differentiating committed erythroid progenitors and was not detected in megakaryocytic, other myeloid progenitors or lymphoblastoid cells lines from DBA patients. During differentiation, non-erythroid lineages upregulate miR181, which results in NLK transcript degradation and loss of NLK expression. The absence of NLK in non-erythroid progenitors prevents NLK activation during ribosomal insufficiency. CRISPR/Cas9 mutation of the miR181 binding site in the NLK 3'UTR in RPS19-insufficient CD34+ HSPCs prevented NLK downregulation, increased NLK activity, and sensitized megakaryocyte and other myeloid lineages (80.5% and 76% reduction relative to controls). This is comparable to the erythroid expansion defect in RPS19-insufficiency (80.7% reduction). In differentiating erythroid progenitors, RPS19 insufficiency increased phosphorylation of the mTORC1 component Raptor (5.3 fold), reducing mTOR activity by 82%. This was restored to basal levels upon pharmacological or genetic inhibition of NLK. To compensate for a reduction in ribosomes, stimulating mTORC1 activity with leucine has been proposed to increase translational efficiency in DBA patients. Probably due to NLK phosphorylation of raptor, DBA patients did not respond as anticipated. While leucine treatment did increase mTOR activity in both control (100% to 188%) and RPS19-insufficiency (27 % to 42% of control), the combined treatment of leucine with NLK inhibition resulted in increased mTOR activity to 142% of control and significantly improved erythroid expansion. Identification of aberrantly activated enzymes, such as NLK, that are specifically expressed in erythroid progenitors, offer therapeutic promise as potential druggable targets in the clinical management of DBA that can be used in combination with existing therapies.
