    "abstract_text": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessive DNA repair disorder characterized by bone marrow (BM) failure, genomic instability, and a predisposition to malignancies. Natural gene therapy due to molecular self-correction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has been reported in a minority of FA patients, suggesting that due to the in vivo selection advantage of the corrected cells, FA is an excellent model disease for stem cell gene therapy. However, the scarcity of autologous HSCs from FA patients for research purposes is one of the major road blocks to preclinical studies with human cells. Here, we developed a lentiviral vector with EGFP as marker gene that co-expresses two distinct shRNA sequences against FANCA under two different human promoters (H1 and U6). In vitro analysis in primary human fibroblasts showed that stable integration of this construct was highly efficient to induce the typical FA cellular phenotypes as assessed by (1) FANCD2 ubiquitination deficiency and (2) a characteristic G2/M arrest upon DNA damage induced by DNA crosslinking reagent Mitomycin C (MMC). We then transduced human cord blood (CB) CD34+ cells with this lentiviral vector and demonstrated a reduced survival of clonogenic cells in progenitor assays at 20nM MMC: 70% (scrambled control shRNA) vs. 23% ( FANCA shRNA). This vector pseudotyped with a foamyviral envelope was then used to transduce CD34+ CB cells on fibronectin CH296. The next day, genetically modified cells were transplanted into NOD.Cg--- Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl /SzJ (NSG) mice. When analyzing the percentage of EGFP+ cells in the human graft (hCD45+ cells), we noticed a progressive decline of EGFP+ cells from 29% on day 5 to 5% at 4 months after transplantation in the peripheral blood of the recipient mice, mimicking the progressive BM failure in FA patients. In contrast, engraftment over time was stable in CD34+ cells transduced with scrambled control shRNA vector (33% on day 5 vs. 34% at 4 months). The human progenitors isolated from the BM of NSG recipient mice at sacrifice 4 months after initial transduction and transplantation are still hypersensitive to MMC, with a much lower survival rate of 34% at 20nM MMC in the FANCA shRNA group as compared to 78% in the scrambled control shRNA group, thus confirming the knockdown by the lentiviral shRNA construct is stable. In summary, the novel double shRNA lentiviral vector is capable of inducing all major hallmarks of FA cells in normal human CB CD34+ cells, thus providing unlimited FA-like cellular materials including NSG mice-repopulating HSCs for preclinical gene therapy and basic stem cell biology research in FA.
