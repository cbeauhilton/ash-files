    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4880 Invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the penis overexpress Cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), Microsomal Prostaglandin E Synthase-1 and Alpha V Beta Integrins. Trace minerals selenium (selenomethionine) is deficient in many neoplasia conditions especially SCC of the penis in HIV-1 patients. Selenium, an essential trace element, has been shown to inhibit tumorigenesis. Hence, selenium and arachidonic acid metabolism may be linked to SCC. Penile cancer (SCC histology) displays elevated COX-2 and PGE2 can be regulated by selenium supplementation. We present a 47 We present a 47 yo male with HIV-1, CD4-133/cumm, VL of 95,000 copies/ml with T4 advanced stage SCC of the penis post XRT, surgical skin graft with extensive lymphedema, pain and KPS score of 40\u201350%. CT scan of Abdomen/Pelvis was c/w extensive disease of his right inguinal region, bladder compressed and displaced into left pelvis and tissue massof the right and left groin with ill defined nodular densities within RLL and left hepatic lobe. Bone marrow was hypocellular, M:E ratio of 8:1 with foamy macrophages. When treated for selenium deficient level and pain with selenomethionine and COX-2 inhibitor, acute tumor lysis syndrome developed with hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia and hypocalcemia defervesing with aggressive therapy with hydration, alkalinization and allopurinol. Conclusion: Overexpression of COX-2, mPEGS-1, alpha V beta integrin leads to phenotypic changes in epithelial cells that could enhance tumorigenesis. Selenium supplementation and COX-2 inhibition may help regulate COX-2 alternating cellular adhesion and promote apoptosis in SCC of the penis and upon treatment of these HIV-1 patients, with heavy tumor burden, tumor lysis syndrome along with disease Invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the penis overexpress Cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), Microsomal Prostaglandin E Synthase-1 and Alpha V Beta Integrins. Trace minerals selenium (selenomethionine) is deficient in many neoplasia conditions and PGE2 can be regulated by selenium supplementation. especially SCC of the penis in HIV-1 patients. Selenium, an essential trace element, has been shown to inhibit tumorigenesis. Hence, selenium and arachidonic acid metabolism may be linked to SCC.
