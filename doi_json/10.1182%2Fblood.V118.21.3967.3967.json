    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3967 Background Triple combinations utilizing dexamethasone, at least one of the \u201cnovel drugs\u201d and either an alkylating agent or an anthracycline are currently considered standard induction regimens in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). In patients (pts) deemed medically fit, subsequent autologous (auto) stem cell transplantation (SCT) yet is a mainstay of care. Whether allogeneic (allo) SCT in first line treatment of MM further improves prognosis remains, however, a matter of debate. We have shown the RAD regimen to be highly effective and well tolerated in relapsed and refractory MM. Therefore, we decided to integrate this combination as a means of induction into the up-front management. Patients and methods The current phase-II trial (DSMM XII) was designed to include pts up to the age of 65 years with newly diagnosed, symptomatic MM. We chose four cycles of RAD induction (lenalidomide 25 mg/day d 1\u201321; infusional adriamycin 9 mg/m 2 and day d1-4; dex 40 mg d1-4 and 17\u201320; pegfilgrastim 6 mg d 6) every 4 weeks followed by chemomobilization (cyclophosphamide, etoposide) of peripheral blood stem cells. Thromboprophylaxis by low molecular weight heparin is mandatory. All pts are scheduled to receive two transplants, the first of which being an auto SCT following standard high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m 2 ). A subsequent allo SCT after preparation with treosulfan/fludarabin is scheduled for pts featuring at least one cytogenetic or serologic risk factor (RF). Those without any RF (\u201cvery favourable risk\u201d) are to proceed to a second auto SCT. All patients will receive 12 months of lenalidomide maintenance. The primary end point of this trial is response to risk-adapted transplant as assessed after second SCT. This is the first planned efficacy interim analysis after 50 pts having terminated induction treatment. Results 148 pts with a median age of 55.5 (range, 30\u201366) years have been enrolled by 16 German centers between 9/2009 and 7/2011. In addition to the intended sample size, 2 pts had progressive disease for a total of 52 pts being evaluable for post-induction response according to the IMWG criteria. 32 pts (62%) had ISS stage II and III disease and all except three were evaluable for cytogenetic analysis based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Incidences of chromosomal abnormalities were as follows: deletion of 13q, 31%; translocation (4;14), 15%; and deletion of 17p, 12%. Overall response rate was 79% including a 52% rate of at least very good partial response (VGPR). Seven pts (13%) achieved confirmed complete response (CR) and stringent CR. 18/52 pts (35%) experienced severe treatment-emergent adverse events (t-SAEs) with an incidence of hematologic events of 4%. Incidences of infections and venous thromboembolism were 8% and 6%, respectively. Conclusions Results from this interim analysis indicate RAD to be a very effective and well tolerated induction protocol in newly diagnosed MM. High-quality response (VGPR or better) to induction is known to be a major prognosticator for long-term prognosis in a given patient. Thus, combination of RAD with risk-adjusted SCT may contribute to enhanced disease control in a substantial proportion of pts. Disclosures: Knop: Celgene Germany GmbH: Consultancy.
