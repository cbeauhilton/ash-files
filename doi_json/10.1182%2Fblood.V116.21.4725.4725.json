    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4725 In the last twenty years enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with imiglucerase has been a clinically effective for Gaucher disease (GD). The recombinant glucocerebrosidase administered intravenously - usually at biweekly intervals by lifelong has improved the quality of life of patients, avoided spleen removal and bone complications. In the last months an acute shortage of imiglucerase manufactured by the Genzyme Corporation (MA, USA) has occurred as a result of viral contamination firstly and other deficiencies in the production facility. In September 2009 a position statement based on the findings of the European Working Group for Gaucher Disease and European Gaucher Alliance, established a set of key recommendations about identification and monitoring of at-risk patients threatened. In Spain the follow-up of patients and the strict complementation of rules of therapy have permitted to obtain a profile of the situation in a group of patients with restricted ERT. Patients and Methods: A total of 50 GD1 patients have been analyzed before and after 6 and 12 months of imiglucerase shortage. Have been excluded for analysis children in order to dose reduction has been minimal as well as patients who have switched to another ERT or miglustat therapy. Results: Gender: 25 males/25 females. Mean age of group: 45.3\u00b115.3 (range:18-84) SSI at diagnosis(Dx): 8.7\u00b13.8 (range:3-19) Chitotriosidase (CT) activity at Dx:13,383\u00b112,783 nM/mL.h; CCL18/PARC at Dx: 767\u00b11,198 ng/mL. 20% of patients were splenectomized and 78% had bone disease at Dx. During shortage 23 patients (46%) discontinued therapy, in this period only one patient suffered a bone crisis and other anaemia as complications. Mean reduction of haemoglobin level: 2.7% (NS), platelet counts: 5.4% (NS). CT activity was increased 135% (p<0.03) and CCL18/PARC 8.2% (p<0.08). In 17 patients (34%) imiglucerase was reduced at 50%, in this period seven patients (41.0%) suffered a bone pain and four patients (23.5%) required support therapy. Mean reduction of haemoglobin level 2.9% (NS), no changes in platelet counts. CT activity increase 48.2% (p<0.03) and not changes in CCL18/PARC concentration was observed. In addition in 3 patients (6%) the reduction was 75% and 7 patients (14%) switched to another ERT (4 patients) or miglustat (3 patients). Conclusions: In our experience, the shortage of imiglucerase in the last months has produced a incidence in bone pain of 20% and one case with anaemia and significant increase of CT activity and no significant changes in blood counts and CCL concentration, 14 % patients has required switch another therapy.
