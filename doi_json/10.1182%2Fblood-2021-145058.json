    "abstract_text": "Background The outcome of infants with KMT2A-germline ALL is much better than of infants with KMT2A-rearranged ALL, but still worse than of non-infant ALL patients. Here, we describe the outcome and prognostic factors for infants with KMT2A -germline ALL treated on Interfant-06 protocol. Methods 167 infants with KMT2A-germline ALL were enrolled in Interfant-06. Univariate analysis on prognostic factors (age, WBC at diagnosis, prednisolone response and CD10 expression) was performed on KMT2A-germline infants in complete remission at the end of induction (EOI) (n=163). Bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD) was measured in 73 patients, by real-time quantitative PCR of immunoglobulin genes and/or T-cell receptor genes, at various time points (EOI, n= 68, end of consolidation (EOC) n= 56, and before OCTADAD (n=57)). MRD results were classified as negative, intermediate (< 5*10 -4 ), and high (\u22655*10 -4 ). Genetic data on NUTM1 rearrangements and MRD were available in 53 patients. Results The 6-year event free survival [SE] and overall survival [ SE] was 73.9% (3,6) and 87.2% (2.7). 28 of 31 (90%) relapses occurred early, within 2 years of diagnosis. Treatment related mortality was 3.6%. Age 6 months of age (p=0.04). Of the MRD timepoints, MRD at end of induction (EOI) was most prognostic for outcome. At EOI, 76.5% (n=52/68) of patients were either MRD negative (41.2%, n=28) or intermediate MRD (35.3%, n=24). 23.5% (n=16) had high EOI MRD, which was associated with significantly lower 6-year DFS (SE), compared to patients with intermediate or negative EOI MRD (61.4% (12.4), 76.4% (11.3) and 87.9% (6.6), respectively; p=0.02, Figure 1a). At EOC, 55.4% (n=31/56) of patients were MRD negative. Outcome by MRD levels at EOC was not significantly different (p=0.24); the 6-year DFS (SE) of negative and intermediate EOC MRD patients was 89.0% (6.0) and 72.7 % (10.6), respectively, while only one of the 5 patients with high EOC MRD relapsed in BM and CNS (Figure 1b). MRD data for both EOI and EOC were available for 55 patients. Of these patients, 18 were MRD negative at EOI and EOC, with a 6-year DFS 93.3% (SE, 6.4). Five patients had negative EOI MRD, but showed intermediate EOC MRD levels; none of these patients relapsed. There were 12 of 55 patients who were MRD positive at EOI and became MRD negative at EOC. These patients had a 6-year DFS of 82.5 % (SE, 11.3). Patients with detectable disease at both timepoints had a 6-year DFS of 68.3% (SE,10.8) (n=20, Figure 1c). At the end of MARMA (TP5), 77.2% (n=44/57) of patients were MRD negative. MRD at TP5 was significantly related to DFS (Figure 1d); the 6-year DFS was 89.6% (SE, 5.0) for MRD negative patients, compared to 65.6% (SE, 14.0) for patients with intermediate MRD levels (p= 0.039). In the current study, NUTM1 status was known in 53 patients with MRD data. Of them, 13 harbored a NUTM1 -rearrangement. Seven out of 11 (63.6%) were aged< 6 months and 6 out of 42 (14.3%) were older. None of them relapsed, despite positive EOI MRD detected in 8 cases. Conclusion We conclude that young age at diagnosis and low EOI MRD are favorable prognostic factors in infants with KMT2A -germline ALL. However, the prognostic value of MRD is not as strong as in infants with KMT2A-rearranged ALL or older children with ALL. This can partly be explained by the differences in genetic makeup of infants with KMT2A -germline ALL, thus supporting the hypothesis that in the future a combined MRD- and genetic-based stratification of KMT2A-g infants might be considered Figure 1 View large Download slide Figure 1 View large Download slide  Close modal Disclosures Biondi:  Colmmune: Honoraria; Bluebird: Other: Advisory Board; Novartis: Honoraria; Incyte: Consultancy, Other: Advisory Board; Amgen: Honoraria.
