    "abstract_text": "Objectives: The mobilization chemotherapy should be directed toward the dual objectives of good antilymphoma activity and adequate PBSC mobilization. Previously, we reported the ESHAP plus G-CSF is an effective mobilization regimen in patients with relapsed and high risk NHL. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and feasibility of autologous stem cell collection after mobilization with Rituximab plus ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin) combination therapy in B-cell Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Patients and Methods: CD20 + B-cell NHL patients with either high risk, relapsed or refractory patients were eligible for the study. The regimen consisted of: Rituximab 375mg/m2 given on day 1, standard ESHAP therapy (etoposide 40mg/m 2 IV/2hr day 2\u20135, methylprednisolone 500mg/m 2 days 2\u20136, cytarabine 2g/m 2 IV/3hr on day 5 and cisplatin 25mg/m 2 CIV days 2\u20135). In all patients, the collection of PBSC was performed during recovery after giving G-CSF (10\u03bc/kg/day) started on day 7. The first harvest was started only if the peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) count exceeded 5/\u03bcl. Results: Fifty-five mobilization procedures performed on 20 patients with a median of three apheresis (range 2\u20135) per patient. Median age was 37 years (range 15\u201365). At the time of PBSC mobilization, Seventeen patients were considered to be responsive (CR, PR and sensitive relapse). Aphereses were started on day 16 (range 13\u201318). The number of total MNCs (\u00d710 6 /kg) collected was 5.4 (range, 1.4\u201314.5) and the number of CD34+cells (\u00d7 10 6 /kg) was 10.6 (range, 4.9\u201352.6). The median days of G-CSF usage was 11(range 9\u201315). Most non-hematologic adverse events were mild and reversible. Nineteen patients (95%) were achieved optimal response, which was defined as \u2265 5 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 cells/kg. In all, sixteen of the patients underwent high-dose chemotherapy. The median time to ANC \u2265 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L was 10 days (range, 8\u201317). The median days to platelets \u2265 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L was 12 (range, 7\u201327). Conclusion: Addition of Rituximab to ESHAP chemotherpy does not show any adverse effect in autologous stem cell mobilization and collection. R-ESHAP regimen is effective as a combined mobilization and second-line regimen for patients with pretreated B-cell lymphoma. Figure 1.
