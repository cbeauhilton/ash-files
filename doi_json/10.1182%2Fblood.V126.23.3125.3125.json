    "abstract_text": "Backgroud: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection/reactivation and associated diseases remain common complications in recipients of HSCT, leading to severe end-organ diseases and malignance. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in cytokine genes is considered to be related with EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) in solid-organ transplantation recipients. In this study, we analyzed the association between cytokine gene polymorphisms and EBV infection/reactivation or diseases in recipients undergoing allo-HSCT. Methods: A total of 233 patients who received allo-HSCT between March 2012 to December 2014 were enrolled in this study. Ten SNPs, including IL-1\u03b2 -511 rs16944, IL-1RN +11100 rs315952, IL-2 -330 rs2069762, IL-4 -590 rs2243250, IL-10 -592 rs1800872, IL-12 +1188 rs3212227, TNF-\u03b1 -308 rs1800629, TGF-\u03b21-509 rs1800469, TGF-\u03b21 +869 rs1800470, IFN-\u03b3 +874 rs2430561, were tested. The SNPs genotypes in patients with or without EBV infection/reactivation and associated diseases were compared. Besides, the risk factors for EBV infection/reactivation were studied. Results: Seventy-four patients developed EBV infection/reactivation. The patients with EBV infection/reactivation had higher frequencies of donor IL-1\u03b2 -511 TT genotype, donor IL-4 -590 TT genotype and recipient TNF-\u03b1 -308 GG genotype than those without (p=0.021, p=0.004, p=0.020, respectively) while the frequencies of donor IL-1\u03b2 -511 CC genotype, donor IL-1RN +11100 TT genotype, donor IL-2 -330 TT genotype, donor IL-4 -590 CC genotype and recipient TNF-\u03b1-308 GA genotype in patients with EBV infection/reactivation were lower than those without (p=0.041, p=0.029, p=0.005, p=0.011, p=0.042, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed donor IL-4 -590TT genotype (p=0.016, HR=1.907, 95% CI =1.130-3.218) and recipient TNF-\u03b1 -308GG genotype (p=0.002, HR=3.550, 95% CI=1.613-7.812) were risk factors for post-transplant EBV infection/reactivation while donor IL-1RN +11100TT genotype (p=0.001, HR=0.382, 95% CI=0.218-0.670) was protective factors for post-transplant EBV infection/reactivation. Twenty-one patients developed EBV-associated diseases. The patients who developed EBV-associated diseases had higher frequency of donor IFN-\u03b3 +874 AT genotype than those did not (p=0.027). On the contrary, the frequencies of donor IL-1\u03b2-511 CC genotype, donor IL-10 -592 AA genotype, donor IL-12 +1188 AA genotype and donor IFN-\u03b3 +874 AA genotype in patients with EBV-associated diseases were lower than those without (p=0.019, p=0.018, p=0.018, p=0.010, respectively). Conclusion: Several SNPs in cytokine genes might be associated with EBV infection/reactivation and the development of EBV-associated diseases in recipients of allo-HSCT. However, these association should be studied further. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
