    "abstract_text": "Abstract 887 Background. Stomal-cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) is known to be involved in bone marrow (BM) engrafment for malignant tumor cells, including CXCR4 expressing multiple myeloma (MM) cells. We hypothesized that de-adhesion of MM cells from the surrounding BM milieu through SDF-1 inhibition will enhance MM sensitivity to therapeutic agents. We therefore tested NOX-A12, a high affinity l-oligonucleotide (Spiegelmer) binder to SDF-1in MM, looking at its ability to modulate MM cell tumor growth and MM cell homing to the BM in vivo and in vitro . Methods. Bone marrow (BM) co-localization of MM tumor cells with SDF-1 expressing BM niches has been tested in vivo by using immunoimaging and in vivo confocal microscopy. MM.1S/GFP+ cells and AlexaFluor633-conjugated anti-SDF-1 monoclonal antibody were used. Detection of mobilized MM-GFP+ cells ex vivo has been performed by flow cytometry. In vivo homing and in vivo tumor growth of MM cells (MM.1S-GFP+/luc+) were assessed by using in vivo confocal microscopy and in vivo bioluminescence detection, in SCID mice treated with 1) vehicle; 2) NOX-A12; 3) bortezomib; 4) NOX-A12 followed by bortezomib. DNA synthesis and adhesion of MM cells in the context of NOX-A12 (50\u2013200nM) treated primary MM BM stromal cells (BMSCs), in presence or absence of bortezomib (2.5\u20135nM), were tested by thymidine uptake and adhesion in vitro assay, respectively. Synergism was calculated by using CalcuSyn software (combination index: C.I. according to Chou-Talalay method). Results. We first showed that SDF-1 co-localizes in the same bone marrow niches of growth of MM tumor cells in vivo . NOX-A12 induced a dose-dependent de-adhesion of MM cells from the BM stromal cells in vitro . These findings were corroborated and validated in vivo : NOX-A12 induced MM cell mobilization from the BM to the peripheral blood (PB) as shown ex vivo , by reduced percentage of MM cells in the BM and increased number of MM cells within the PB of mice treated with NOX-A12 vs. control (BM: 57% vs. 45%; PB: 2.7% vs. 15%). We next showed that NOX-A12-dependent de-adhesion of MM cells from BMSCs lead to enhanced MM cell sensitivity to bortezomib, as shown in vitro , where a synergistic effect between NOX-A12 (50\u2013100 nM) and bortezomib (2.5\u20135 nM) was observed (C.I.: all between 0.57 and 0.76). These findings were validated in vivo : tumor burden detected by BLI was similar between NOX-A12- and control mice whereas bortezomib-treated mice showed significant reduction in tumor progression compared to the control ( P <.05); importantly significant reduction of tumor burden in those mice treated with sequential administration of NOX-A12 followed by bortezomib was observed as compared to bortezomib alone treated mice ( P <.05). Similarly, NOX-A12 + bortezomib combination induced significant inhibition of MM cell homing in vivo , as shown by in vivo confocal microscopy, as compared to bortezomib used as single agent. Conclusion. Our data demonstrate that the SDF-1 inhibiting Spiegelmer NOX-A12 disrupts the interaction of MM cells with the BM milieu both in vitro and in vivo , thus resulting in enhanced sensitivity to bortezomib.
