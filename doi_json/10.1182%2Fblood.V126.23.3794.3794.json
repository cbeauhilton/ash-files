    "abstract_text": "Background: The use of short-ranged (50-80 \u00b5m), high-energy (~100 keV/\u00b5m) \u03b1 particle-emitting isotopes for radioimmunotherapy may result in more specific tumor cell kill and less damage to normal tissues than \u03b2-emitters. 225 Ac-lintuzumab consists of a radiometal that emits four \u03b1-particles linked to an anti-CD33 antibody. A phase I trial showed that 225 Ac-lintuzumab is safe at doses \u2264 3 \u00b5Ci/kg and has anti-tumor activity against relapsed/refractory AML across all dose levels studied (Jurcic et al. ASH, 2011). We are conducting a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxicity, and biological activity of fractionated-dose 225 Ac-lintuzumab in combination with LDAC. Patients and Methods: Patients \u2265 60 years with untreated AML not suitable for standard induction chemotherapy ( e.g. , antecedent hematologic disorder, unfavorable cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities, and significant comorbidities) were eligible. Patients received LDAC 20 mg twice daily for 10 days every 4-6 weeks for up to 12 cycles. During Cycle 1, two fractions of 225 Ac-lintuzumab were given one week apart, beginning 4-7 days following completion of LDAC. To prevent radiation-induced nephrotoxicity, patients were given furosemide while receiving 225 Ac-lintuzumab and spironolactone for one year afterward. 225 Ac doses were escalated using a 3+3 design. Four dose levels were studied with a total accrual of up to 24 patients. In planned analyses, dose escalation proceeded if < 33% of patients in a cohort experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Results: Fourteen patients (median age, 77 years; range, 68-87 years) completed therapy. An additional patient received only one of two planned fractions of 225 Ac-lintuzumab due to technical issues and is excluded from analysis. Nine (64%) had prior myelodysplastic syndrome, for which seven received prior therapy with hypomethylating agents (n=6) or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (n=1). One patient (7%) had chronic myeloid leukemia in molecular remission prior to development of AML. Nine patients (64%) had intermediate-risk and five (36%) had unfavorable cytogenetics. Median CD33 expression was 81% (range, 45-100%). 225 Ac-lintuzumab was given at 0.5 (n=3), 1 (n=6), 1.5 (n=3), or 2 (n=2) \u03bcCi/kg/fraction. Up to 4 cycles of LDAC were administered. DLT was seen in one patient at 1 \u00b5Ci/kg/fraction who had grade 4 thrombocytopenia with marrow aplasia for more than 6 weeks following therapy. Hematologic toxicities included grade 4 neutropenia (n=4) and thrombocytopenia (n=6). Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities included febrile neutropenia (n=7), pneumonia (n=4), bacteremia (n=1), cellulitis (n=1), transient creatinine increase (n=1), hypokalemia (n=1), rectal hemorrhage (n=1), and generalized weakness (n=2). Eight of 11 patients (73%) evaluated after Cycle 1 had bone marrow blast reductions (mean reduction, 72%; range, 34-100%). Seven (64%) had blast reductions of at least 50%. Objective responses (1 CR, 1 CRp, 2 CRi) were seen in four of the 14 patients (29%) after one cycle of therapy (Table 1). Responses were seen only at doses \u2265 1 \u00b5Ci/kg/fraction (4 of 11 patients, 36%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.7 months (range, 1.7-16.9 months). Median overall survival (OS) was 5.5 months (range, 2.2-24 months). Conclusions: Fractionated-dose 225 Ac-linutuzmab can be safely combined with LDAC and produce remission in older patients with untreated AML. Dose escalation continues to define the MTD. Additional patients will be treated at the MTD in the phase II portion of this trial to determine response rate, PFS, and OS. Table 1. Objective Responses  Response .
