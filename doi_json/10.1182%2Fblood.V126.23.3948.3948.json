    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Traditional platinum-based salvage regimens like DHAP, ICE are effective in relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), but are more toxic. Gemcitabine based regimens are equally effective in salvage of lymphomas, but are less toxic and allow better stem cell collection for subsequent high dose therapy (HDT). There is limited data on the usefulness of gemcitabine based salvage regimens after the failure of salvage therapies like DHAP and ICE. At our center, we used a combination of gemcitabine, vinorelbine and dexamethasone (GVDexa), a non-platinum containing regimen in those patients who failed DHAP/ ICE based salvage treatment. METHODS: The records of patients with relapsed and refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma, who were treated with GVDexa, were reviewed. The regimen consisted of Gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV (D1,8), Vinorelbine 25mg/m2 IV (D1,8) Dexamethasone 40mg oral (D1-4) given as outpatient. It was given for 2-3 cycles until best response or till the patient underwent HDT. RESULTS: Between July 2010 to Jun 2015, 25 patients received GVDexa. The median age was 23 years (Range: 11 to 45 yrs) and 64% were males. Baseline characteristics are summarised in Table 1. Twenty-one patients (84%) had previous exposure to salvage therapy with DHAP/ ICE and GVDexa was given as third line treatment. The overall response rate was 48% (12/25) with complete response in 20% (5/25) and partial response in 28% (7/25). Toxicity: A total of 61 cycles [Median: 2 (Range: 1-6)] were delivered among 25 patients. Grade 3/4 haematological toxicities (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) occurred in 9/61 (14.7%) cycles and febrile neutropenia occurred in 2 (3.2%) cycles. Grade 3/4 non-haematological toxicities were rare (paralytic ileus in 1 patient). There were no toxic deaths. Stem cell collection: Stem cell harvesting for HDT was attempted in 12 patients and was successful (> 2 million CD34 positive cells/kg) in 8 (67%) patients. Seven of these patients successfully completed HDT. Two patients who failed stem cell collection underwent reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic transplant. CONCLUSIONS: GVDexa, when used as third line therapy in relapsed and refractory HL shows promising response rates, with minimal toxicity. The high response rates achieved despite failure of first line platinum based salvage, points to the potential usefulness of this regimen as first line salvage therapy in refractory HL. GVDexa could emerge as a safe and effective non-platinum containing alternative regimen for second-line therapy in HL. Table 1. Baseline characteristics (N=25)  PARAMETER .
