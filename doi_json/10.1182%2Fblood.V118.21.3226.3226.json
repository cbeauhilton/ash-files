Methods 12 primary myelofibrosis and 19 chronic aplastic anemia patients who had all accepted routine therapy more than 6 months,because of pathogenetic condition, they needed infusing constituent blood such as at least condensed red blood cells 6 units and platelet 4 units per months, and despite this, whole blood cells counts were very lower. Those patients all had intermittent dizzy, fatigue, bad appetite and purpura. Because of age, complication, and psychological reasons, they refused Allogenic stem cell transplantation. So besides routine therapy, they received umbilical MSCs 1\u00d710 7 , every two weeks one time, those cells were injected directly into medullary cavity of ilium. Results 28 recipients showed hematopoietic reconstitution when PLT was up to 20\u00d710 9 /L and granulocytes was up to 2.0\u00d710 9 /L on day 28 post MSCs infusion. Bone marrow biopsy showed hyperplasia from hypoplasia to evident hyperplasia. On day 28, Th cells ascended from 23.0 to 36.2, Ts cells descended from 24.2 to 14.6, Th .. MTs from 0.95 to 2.47:1, IgG from 6.6 to 13.3, NK cells from 2.40 to 13.5, indicating earlier immune recorrect. At the last follow-up of 12 months, 17 patients showed normal hemoglobin and platelet counts, immune globulin was in the normal level, indicating the hematopoietisis and immune persistent reconstitution. 5 patients still needed infusing constituent blood cells, although, the interval of platelet and red blood cells infusion obviously prolonged, and the times to see doctor decreased and life quality elevated greatly. Conclusion This is a novel clinical research of successful treatment of refractory CAA and MF, it tell us infusion HLA-mismatched allogenic MSCs directly into medullary cavity of ilium is efficiency and security.
