    "abstract_text": "Background: Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas with marked clinical, pathological, and molecular heterogeneity. Outcomes following standard therapy generally are poor; however, few candidate therapeutic targets have been identified for precision medicine approaches. Retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) is a transcription factor that modulates cell growth and differentiation in response to natural or synthetic retinoids. Retinoids have been used successfully to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia and some cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs). However, the function of RARA and the action of retinoids in PTCL have not been defined. Methods: Based on identification of a PTCL patient with a non-synonymous point mutation, RARA R394Q, identified in the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine, we sought to characterize the role of RARA in PTCL cells. To investigate the role of wild-type and mutant RARA, we constructed expression vectors containing either wild-type RARA or RARA R394Q coding sequences, and also used siRNAs targeting RARA to study the role of native RARA expression. Cell lines derived from post-thymic T-cell malignancies were used for in vitro studies, including HuT78 and Mac-1 (both derived from circulating tumor cells from CTCL patients) and Karpas 299 (from an ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma). Following RARA overexpression or knockdown, we measured cell growth, cell cycle regulation, and sensitivity to synthetic retinoids. In addition, RNA sequencing and pathway analysis were performed to profile the transcriptomic response to retinoids in malignant T cells. Results: In two RARA low cell lines, Karpas 299 and HuT78, overexpression of wild-type RARA or RARA R394Q significantly increased cell growth (p<0.001), with a greater increase observed from mutant versus wild-type RARA in Karpas 299 (136% of control versus 122%; p=0.04). Accordingly, knockdown of wild-type RARA in the RARA high cell line, Mac-1, resulted in a 22% inhibition of cell growth (p=0.0002). This inhibition specifically was associated with G 1 cell cycle arrest (120% of control; p=0.004) and decreased protein expression of the G 1 -S-associated cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. These kinases were up-regulated by overexpression of RARA in RARA low HuT78 cells. The relatively RARA-specific retinoid, AM80 (tamibarotene), and the less specific retinoid, all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA), resulted in RARA protein degradation, cell growth inhibition that was both dose-dependent and proportional to baseline RARA expression, G 1 arrest, and CDK protein up-regulation. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of transcriptome data confirmed that genes down-regulated by AM80 were highly enriched for regulators of cell cycle and particularly G1-S transition. Finally, overexpressing RARA in RARA low Karpas 299 and HuT78 cell lines significantly increased the ability of AM80 to inhibit CDK2/4/6 expression and cell growth (16% to 23% greater growth inhibition than control; p<0.05). Conclusions: RARA drives cyclin-dependent kinase expression and G 1 -S transition in malignant T cells, and promotes cell growth. These functions may be enhanced by specific RARA gene mutations. Synthetic retinoids inhibit these functions in a dose-dependent fashion, and are most effective in cells with high RARA expression. These data suggest RARA as a candidate therapeutic target in some PTCL patients.
