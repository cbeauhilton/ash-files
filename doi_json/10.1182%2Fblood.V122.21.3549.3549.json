    "abstract_text": "Background Platelet dense granule (DG) deficiencies, including Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, are relatively common and frequently under-diagnosed hereditary platelet hypofunctional disorders. Among various laboratory tests, platelet whole mount (WM) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is considered the gold standard method for diagnosing DG deficiencies. Nevertheless, platelet DG TEM testing is still largely a research tool and has not been thoroughly validated and standardized as a clinical test. Furthermore, reference ranges (RR) of DG count/platelet (DGC) have not been adequately established. Aim Our goals were to validate and standardize platelet WM TEM testing and establish reference ranges for platelet DGC. Methods Based on previously established methods (Blood, 33:598-606), we first optimized and standardized various pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical procedures including sample matrix, sample stability, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) preparation, platelet mounting procedure and DG counting criteria. Then whole blood samples in ACD-B tubes were collected from a total of 128 healthy donors (64 males and 64 females). Platelet DGC, percentage of platelets without any DG (empty platelets), platelet count (PC), mean platelet volume (MPV) and immature platelet fraction (IPF) were measured. In addition, platelet aggregometry analyses were performed on citrated PRP samples from the same donors. Standard statistical analyses were employed in this study. Results DGC and platelet ultra-structure were stable when whole blood samples were stored at room temperature (RT) for up to 4 days. Reproducible DGC and adequate preservation of platelet ultrastructure depended on an optimized mounting method. The DG counting criteria were developed based on previous publications and guidance from Dr. James G. White. Using the same WM TEM images and DG counting criteria, agreements among different technologists (n=5) improved from 60% to 95%. Finally, DGC reference range study using 128 healthy donor samples (age range 18, 72 years) and scoring 100-200 platelets from each donor showed that the DGC distribution of each donor sample was left-skewed with a median of 15% of empty platelets (range: 3, 40). The median DGC was 2.6 with a range of 1.0\u20145.1. Reference ranges established at the lower 95 th percentile for DGC empty platelets is \u2264 31% (95% CI 28, 34) and for the mid-95 th percentiles of DGCs between 1.5 and 4.0. DGCs were weakly associated with MPV and IPF (\u03c1 between 0.22 and 0.28); and inversely associated with the percentage of empty platelets (\u03c1 between -0.26 and -0.25). DGC showed no significant association with PC, platelet maximum aggregation or primary slope of aggregation, nor age or gender. Conclusion We validated platelet WM TEM procedures and for the first time established an adult reference range for platelet DGC. The results of association analyses implied that immature platelets may have slightly more DGs. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
