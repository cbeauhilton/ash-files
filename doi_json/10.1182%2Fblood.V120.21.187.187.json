    "abstract_text": "Abstract 187 CLL patients with high-risk disease features have shorter remissions and a poor outcome with conventional chemo-immunotherapy, particularly in the relapsed disease setting. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, ibrutinib, thwarts B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and is a promising new targeted therapy for patients with mature B cell malignancies, particularly patients with CLL. Data from the Phase 1/2 trials demonstrated that high-risk CLL patients responded equally as well as low-risk patients to ibrutinib. Single-agent ibrutinib-treated CLL patients characteristically have delayed responses or stable disease due to persistent lymphocytosis, caused by re-distribution of tissue-resident CLL cells into the peripheral blood. To accelerate and improve responses and to expand upon the ibrutinib experience in high-risk CLL patients, we conducted a Phase 2 single-center clinical trial of ibrutinib plus rituximab, which accrued 40 patients between February and July, 2012. Methods: Patients were treated with ibrutinib 420 mg PO daily, in combination with weekly rituximab (375 mg/m2) for weeks 1\u20134 (cycle 1), then daily ibrutinib plus monthly rituximab until cycle 6, followed by daily single-agent ibrutinib. Study inclusion required high-risk disease (del17p or TP53 mutation [treated or untreated], patients with PFS < 36 months after frontline chemo-immunotherapy, or relapsed CLL with del11q. Results: Patient characteristics include a median age of 65 (range 35\u201382); median of 2 prior therapies, 14 female and 26 male patients. Median Rai stage was 4 (range 1\u20134), \u03b22 microglobulin 4.2 mg/L (2.2 \u2013 12.3), 31 patients had unmutated IGHV , only one patient mutated IGHV, the remaining patients had inconclusive IGHV results. 19 patients had del17p or TP53 mutation (4 without prior therapy), and 13 patients had del11q. At a median follow up of 4 months, 38 of 40 patients continue on therapy without disease progression. 1 patient died from an unrelated infectious complication, and one patient withdrew consent before starting therapy. Out of 20 patients evaluable for early response assessment at 3 months, 17 patients achieved a partial remission (PR) for an ORR of 85%, and three achieved a PR with persistent lymphocytosis. Interestingly, on this combination trial, the re-distribution lymphocytosis peaked earlier and the duration was shorter (see Figure) than with single-agent ibrutinib, presumably due to the addition of rituximab. Treatment was well tolerated, with only 13 cases of grade 3 (n=11) or grade 4 (n=2) toxicities, which were largely unrelated and transient, such as neutropenia, fatigue, pneumonia (n=1), insomnia, and bone aches. Questionnaires revealed an improved overall health and quality of life after 3 cycles of treatment in the evaluable patients (n=21). Conclusion: Ibrutinib in combination with rituximab is a safe, well tolerated regimen for high-risk CLL patients, which induces very high early response rates. These encouraging data, together with the Phase 1/2 data, emphasize the need for rapid further development of ibrutinib for high-risk CLL patients, given that current alternative treatment options for this patient population are not satisfactory.
