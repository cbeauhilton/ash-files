    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4914 Background: Acute lympoblastic leukemia (ALL) with complex chromosomal aberrations (CCAs) which patients harboring three or more acquired chromosomal aberrations always have a poor outcome. Philadelphia chromosome\u2013positive (Ph+) ALL is the largest genetically defined subtype in adult ALL with the most unfavorable prognosis. It is necessary to investigate the clinical and laboratory features of ALL patients with CCAs, analyze the distribution of Ph+ in these patients and assess the prognosis. Methods: In a retrospective follow-up study from 2005.1\u223c2011.6, 38 ALL patients with CCAs were investigated. All cases were diagnosed with morphological,immunological,cytogenetic classification and molecular biology. The karyotypes were interpreted according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN). Clinical characteristics, laboratory features, treatment response and prognosis of ALL patients with CCAs were analyzed. Results: The study included 17 Ph+ ALL patients with an age range of 12 to 81 years (mean, 34.5 years) and a male to female ratio of 1:1. Ph+ ALL patients with CCAs were older than Ph- cases (P=0.096). The median survival time was 9.5 months (range, 1\u201344 months). The complete remission (CR) rate after two cycles of systemic chemotherapy was 53.6% (15/28) and the relapse rate was 53.3% (8/15). Ph+ ALL patients with CCAs showed a lower CR rate than Ph- cases. Eleven patients died during the follow-up period, six of them died within 2 months from the initial ALL diagnosis, and nine patients were failure to achieve CR. Three patients underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT): two of them presented Ph+ relapsed after 2 and 10 months, respectively. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we found the survival outcome of Ph+ ALL patients with CCAs is inferior to Ph- cases. Conclusion: Treatment outcomes of ALL patients with CCAs receiving chemotherapy or BMT are very poor. Ph+ as an unfavorable parameter influences on the CR rate and survival outcome. It is necessary to accumulate more clinical data to find innovative treatments that can improve the prognosis of this refractory leukemia. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
