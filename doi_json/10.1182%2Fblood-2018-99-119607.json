    "abstract_text": "Introduction Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) represents 20-30% of acute leukemia in adults. Higher incidence and inferior outcomes in Hispanic population have been described. In Latin Americans induction mortality (IM) is a major cause of death representing 20-50% vs. 7-11% in developed countries. Our aim was to determine risk factors (RF) related to IM in ALL Hispanic adult patients. Methods We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of \u226518yo patients with ALL diagnosed and treated at our institution within 2009 and 2016. Results A total of 170 patients were included. Median age was 29 years (16-70), 64% were AYA, 96.8% had B-cell ALL, and 62.3% received Hyper-CVAD. IM rate was 13.4%. In 64.1% IM was related to an infectious cause. The most frequent infection was pneumonia (39.8%). Gram-negative etiology was more prevalent (35.5% vs. 10.2%), however, IM rate was higher in gram-positive infections (26.3% vs . 13.6%; p =.028). RF related to IM in univariate analysis were: CNS involvement (OR4.6,95%IC2.8-9.5; p =<.001), tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.2-14.1; p =<.001), need for dialysis (OR 28.9, 95% CI 5.3-157.1; p =<.001), primary hypertension (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.0-12.7; p =.052), shock status (OR 10.3, 95% CI 3.9-27.3; p =<.001), ECOG\u00b32 (OR 1.9, 95% IC 1.1-3.4; p =.022), T-ALL (OR 2.2, 95% IC 1.1-4.3; p =.026), Hyper-CVAD (OR 1.9, 95% IC 1.1-3.8; p =0.51), ventilation assistance (OR 7.7, 95% IC 2.8-21; p =<.001), and vasopressor use (OR 7.6, 95% IC 2.8-20.6; p =<.001). In multivariate analysis TLS, need for dialysis and shock, kept statistical significance. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the largest study that evaluates the impact over IM of biological, social, and economic factors in Hispanic adult patients with ALL. We identified factors not previously described such as hypertension and need for dialysis. Multicenter prospective studies most be urged to asses and validate these RF, and design a bedside prognostic score that can predict an increased risk of IM at ALL diagnosis.
