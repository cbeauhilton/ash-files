    "abstract_text": "Introduction: F based regimen have become the standard treatment in CLL at least in younger pts. However, in elderly pts chlorambucil is still frequently used since it is easy to administer and has less side effects. Here we compare the efficacy and toxicity of F administered to younger pts and elderly pts treated between 1999 and 2004 within two phase III trials of GCLLSG. Patients: 362 pts (median age 59 [range 37\u201365] years) were randomized to F (n=182) or F plus cyclophosphamide (n=180) within the CLL4 trial. 191 elderly pts (median age 71 [range 65\u201379] years) were treated with F (92 pts) or chlorambucil (99 pts) within the CLL5 protocol. Inclusion criteria were identical in both trials except for age limits. All pts were previously untreated and in advanced stage Binet C or Binet B with symptoms which require therapy or Binet A with severe B-symptoms. In both studies the F regimen consisted of 30 mg/m 2 /day (d) IV for 5 consecutive days, every 28 d for up to 6 cycles. Anti-infective prophylaxis and growth factors were not given routinely in both trials. Results: Most of patients in both age groups were in Binet stage B (54% of the younger pts and 52% of the elderly), 35% in each age group were in Binet stage C, 11% and 13% respectively in Binet stage A. No significant difference in the main clinical features was observed except for a higher incidence of concomitant disease in the elderly (61% versus 36%, p=0.001). A mean number of 5.2 F courses was administered in the CLL4 trial and 4.9 courses in the CLL5 trial. The mean administered cumulative dose of F per pt was lower in the elderly pts (1076 mg vs. 1194 mg, p= 0.05). Overall response rates were similar in both arms, with 82.9% in the younger group and 85.7% in the elderly. The complete remission rate was 6.7% in the younger patients and 10.4% in the elderly (p= 0.3). After a follow up time of 24 months (mo) the progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly shorter in the elderly group with 18.7 mo compared to 19.8 mo in the younger group after 22 mo observation time (p=0.03). The overall survival (OS) was significantly impaired in elderly pts as well (29 mo versus median not reached, p<0.001). Progressive disease was the main cause of death in both age groups. In each group 3 treatment related deaths occurred due to infection or hemolysis. The incidence of side effects was similar in both age groups. Severe, CTC grade 3 and 4, myelosuppression occurred in 39% of the younger and 41% of the elderly pts. No difference in the rate of leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia or anemia was oberved as well. The incidence rate and severity of infections was similar in both groups (24% vs. 32% all and 8.7% vs. 6.9% CTC grade 3 and 4). The incidence of second neoplasia was significantly higher in the elderly pts (2.2% vs. 12.2%, p=0.001). In comparison the prevalence rate of neoplasia in the U.S. population peaks at 11% in the age group of 70\u201379 (SEER cancer statistic review: 1972\u20132002). Conclusion: F is a well tolerated treatment regimen in first line therapy of elderly pts with CLL. Response rates were similar in both age groups. PFS and OS were significantly shorter in the elderly population. The incidence of second neoplasia was significantly higher in the elderly pts, but is only slightly increased in comparison to the normal population.",
