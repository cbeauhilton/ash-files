    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2766 Background: Lenalidomide plus rituximab therapy is a highly effective and well-tolerated therapy in patients (pts) with follicular lymphoma (FL). In a Phase II trial, this combination induced a complete remission rate of 87% in pts with advanced stage untreated FL (Fowler et al, Ann Oncol, 2011; 22; suppl 4:137). A randomized Phase III trial was recently initiated to compare this combination with current standard of care therapies in pts with FL. Although lenalidomide is known to be an immunomodulatory drug with effects on a variety of immune cells in vitro, its effects have not been well studied in vivo in humans. Understanding the in vivo effects of lenalidomide could lead to novel combination strategies to enhance the efficacy and improve clinical outcome in FL and other malignancies. Methods: Pts received lenalidomide 20 mg/day on days 1\u201321 of each 28-day cycle and rituximab was given at 375 mg/m 2 on day 1 of each cycle. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were phenotyped by multiparametric flow cytometry at baseline, on cycle 2 day 15 (C2D15), and at the end of cycle 6. In addition, peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes at baseline and on C2D15 for whole genome gene expression profiling (GEP). Results: Immunophenotyping of baseline and end of cycle 6 PBMC (n=17) showed that the percentages and absolute numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, TCRgd, and Foxp3+ regulatory T cells; and NK, NKT, and myeloid dendritic cells were not significantly different between the two time points. However, a significant increase in CD4+CD45RO+ (p<0.01) and CD8+CD45RO+ (p=0.04) memory T cells was observed post-therapy. Further characterization of CD4+ T cells showed a significant increase in central memory T cells (p<0.001) and a decrease in nai\u0308ve (p<0.01) and terminally differentiated (p<0.01) T cells, but no change in effector memory T cells. The increase in CD8+ central memory T cells was marginally significant (p=0.06). Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) were also significantly increased (p=0.02). In contrast, no such changes in T cell subsets or PDC were observed in FL pts (n=9) treated with 6 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy that received equal number of rituximab doses and analyzed at similar time points (baseline and end of cycle 6). To understand lenalidomide-induced changes on a molecular level, we compared GEP data at C2D15 vs. baseline for 7 pairs of PB samples. The paired significance analysis of microarrays method, based on Student's t test, identified 1,748 differentially expressed genes (DEG; 713 up, 1035 down), without a fold-change threshold, in C2D15 samples vs. baseline. Results were influenced by rituximab-induced depletion of B cells in C2D15 samples, but there were many changes that suggested altered PBMC physiology. Noteworthy up-regulated genes (>1.5 fold) included genes associated with T and NK cell activation including BATF, CCR2, CD1B, CD2, CD160, CTLA4, CXCR3, ICOS, and LAG3; and CD163 and CD209, phagocytic receptors expressed on monocytes/macrophages. Down-regulated genes (>1.5 fold) included CXCR5, which mediates B cell migration into follicles; and IL1B and TNFSF13B (BAFF), which are produced by activated macrophages and induce B cell proliferation. Gene set enrichment analysis of all GEP results, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of DEGs, indicated up regulation of multiple pathways and processes including ribosomal and mitochondrial components involved in translation and oxidative phosphorylation, CTLA4 signaling in cytotoxic T cells, and differentiation and signaling by ICOS and CD28 in T helper cells. We confirmed up regulation of CTLA4, ICOS, and LAG3 at the protein level in C2D15 PBMC by flow cytometry. Furthermore, treatment of PBMC derived from untreated FL pts with lenalidomide in vitro resulted in up regulation of these molecules in T and/or NK cells consistent with our in vivo results. Conclusions: In FL pts, lenalidomide induced multiple changes in the immune system including increases in PDC and memory T cell subsets, activation of T and NK cells, and down-regulation of certain genes mediating B cell migration and proliferation. These results provide insights into the mechanism of action of lenalidomide and suggest that it can be combined with other immunostimulatory agents such as therapeutic vaccines, adoptive T cell therapy strategies, and immune checkpoint inhibitors to further enhance its efficacy in FL and other malignancies.
