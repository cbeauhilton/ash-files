    "abstract_text": "Background Inherited thrombocytopenia is associated with bleeding tendency and no association with thrombotic tendency has been reported. We found a Japanese family with autosomal dominant form of thrombocytopenia associated with arterial and venous thrombosis. Aims To identify a causative gene for hereditary thrombocytopenia with thrombosis. Methods A propositus was a 42-year-old Japanese woman with thrombocytopenia and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She had normal activities of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S, and negative results for lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin antibodies. She has suffered from thrombocytopenia (20 - 50 x 10 9 /L) for at least 20 years. Six members among her family pedigree had thrombocytopenia, and also suffered from thrombosis including mesenteric artery thrombosis, young-onset myocardial infarction, femoral artery thrombosis, repeated cerebral infarction, DVT, and pulmonary embolism. Importantly, the family members with these thrombotic disorders had exclusively thrombocytopenia. Whole exome sequencing was performed with venous blood from the 6 affected and 6 non-affected family members to identify a causative gene for thrombocytopenia. Results We identified a heterozygous change (c.764G>T:p.G255V) in GPR25 gene, an uncharacterized G protein-coupled receptor. The mutation was completely linked with thrombocytopenia. The mutated residue was located at the transmembrane domain of GPR25. We generated anti-GPR25 monoclonal antibodies and confirmed that GPR25 was expressed on the platelet surface. The patient's platelets showed the same level of PAC1 (a monoclonal antibody recognizing the active conformation of integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23) binding and P-selectin expression as platelets from healthy subjects. However, ADP-induced aggregation of patient's washed platelets was enhanced as compared with normal washed platelets. Moreover, the patient's platelets had an increase in thrombin + collagen-induced and A23187-induced Annexin V binding compared with platelets from healthy subjects. Conclusion We identified a novel gene mutation responsible for inherited thrombocytopenia and thrombosis that may induce platelet hyper-reactivity.
