    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4648 Background. PIM-2 is a proto-oncogene that encodes for serine/threonine kinase which interacts with various signalling molecules. PIM-2 is highly expressed in neoplastic tissues and in leukaemic and lymphoma cell lines which is consistent with a its role during oncogenic transformation. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway appears to be deregulated in variety of tumors, with sustained activity of NF-\u03baB leading to apoptotic resistance in tumor cells The aim. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the PIM-2 and NF-\u03baB expression is altered in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Patients and methods. One hundred fourty-three patients were included: 91 with AML and 52 with ALL (42 with B-ALL and 10 with T-ALL), aged 18\u201384 (median=41). Seventy-five patients reached complete remission (CR): 50 in AML and 25 in ALL. Bone marrow samples were collected at the time of diagnosis. Control samples were obtained from 24 healthy donors. We analysed PIM-2 and NF-\u03baB expression by RQ-PCR analysis. Results. Expression of both PIM-2 and NF-\u03baB in all leukaemic patients and in subgroups: AML and ALL was significantly higher than in controls. In AML group patients who reached CR expressed PIM-2 and NF-\u03baB at significantly lower levels than patients with primary resistance to chemotherapy (with no CR, NCR). Moreover in AML, we have found the correlation between PIM-2, NF-\u03baB expression and blasts in myelogram and PIM-2 and patients\u2018 age. Summary. Our data indicate that PIM-2 and NF-\u03baB genes expression is increased in patients with AML and ALL and correlates with CR rate in AML patients.
