    "abstract_text": "The transcriptional co-activator CITED2 has a conserved role in the maintenance of normal adult hematopoiesis. We have shown before that CD34 + cells from a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients display enhanced CITED2 expression and that interfering with this expression is detrimental for leukemia maintenance. Ectopic expression of CITED2 in normal CD34 + stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) resulted in increased proliferation and skewed myelo-erythroid differentiation in vitro . Long-Term Culture-Initiating Cell assays (LTC-IC) revealed a 5-fold increase in the number of Cobblestone Area Forming Cells (CAFCs), as a result of an increase in the number of phenotypically defined CD34 + CD38 - HSCs. CFC frequencies were also enhanced 5-fold upon CITED2 overexpression. To further substantiate these observations in vivo, we transplanted CITED2-transduced CD34 + cells into NSG mice. CD34 + cells with increased CITED2 expression displayed a >10x higher engraftment at week 12, as compared to control cells, confirming the higher frequency of CD34 + CD38 - HSCs, while myelo-lymphoid differentiation of these cells was comparable to control transplanted cells. Till date we have not observed leukemia development in these transplanted mice, suggesting that CITED2 as a single hit is not sufficient to transform human CB CD34 + cells. We recently identified the myeloid transcription factor PU.1 as a strong negative regulator of CITED2 and enhanced CITED2 expression in AML samples correlates with low PU.1 expression. We therefore investigated whether high CITED2 and low PU.1 expression would collaborate in maintaining self-renewal of HSCs. We combined lentiviral downregulation of PU.1 with overexpression of CITED2 (PU.1 Low -CITED2 High ) and performed LTC-IC cultures on MS5 stroma. These experiments revealed that combined loss of PU.1 and enhanced CITED2 expression was sufficient to induce a strong proliferative advantage compared to control cells. Furthermore, a 3-fold increase of progenitor numbers was observed in CFC assays. While overexpression of CITED2 alone was not sufficient to allow 2 nd CFC formation, additional downregulation of PU.1 now led to colony formation upon serial replating. This replating capacity of PU.1 Low -CITED2 High cells was limited to CD34 + CD38 - HSCs, as replating of CD34 + CD38 + progenitor cells did not yield CFCs. This suggests that the combined loss of PU.1 and enhanced CITED2 expression is sufficient to maintain self-renewal properties of HSC, but this combination is not sufficient to reinforce self-renewal in committed progenitor cells. To more stringently assess self-renewal, cells were first cultured for 4 weeks on MS5 under myeloid differentiating conditions (G-CSF, IL3 and TPO) and subsequently plated into CFC assays, followed by secondary and tertiary replating experiments. Only PU.1 Low -CITED2 High cells were able to form CFCs after 10 weeks of culture, indicating that this combination indeed preserves self-renewal. Current experiments focus on the in vivo engraftment and self-renewal properties of these PU.1 Low -CITED2 High cells. Preliminary data indicate that these PU.1 Low -CITED2 High cells contribute \u223c3-fold more to the myeloid lineage at week 12, compared to control and CITED2 only cells, and AML development is currently being investigated in these mice. Together, these data suggest that CITED2 is sufficient to increase LTC-IC and CFC frequencies, to skew myeloid differentiation, and to enhance engraftment of CB CD34 + cells in xenograft mice. Furthermore, CITED2 overexpression together with reduced PU.1 levels is necessary to maintain stem cell self-renewal. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
