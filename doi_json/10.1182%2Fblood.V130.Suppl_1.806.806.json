    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Published studies of CD19 CAR T cells have shown unprecedented response rates in ALL but with a 23-27% incidence of severe Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and 27-50% incidence of severe neurotoxicity which may limit broader application. We developed a novel second generation CD19CAR (CAT-41BBz CAR) with a lower affinity and faster off-rate but equivalent on-rate than the FMC63-41BBz CAR (Kd 116 nM vs 0.9 nM, T 1/2 10s vs 1260s) utilised in CTL019 currently under consideration by the FDA. Pre-clinical studies indicated T-cells transduced with CAT-41BBz mediate enhanced tumor clearance and show increased expansion in an NSG-NALM6 stress test model (Kramer et al. , submitted). We here report interim results from a multi-centre, Phase I clinical study of autologous CAT-41BBz CAR T cells as therapy for high risk/relapsed paediatric ALL, CARPALL (NCT02443831) demonstrating efficacy with an excellent safety profile. Methods: Autologous T cells were activated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads, transduced with a SIN lentiviral vector encoding CAT-41BBz CAR and expanded for 4 days prior to magnetic bead removal and cryopreservation. Transduction efficiency was assessed using an anti-idiotype antibody. Serum levels of cytokines associated with CRS were measured using cytometric bead array. All patients received lymphodepletion with fludarabine 150 mg/m 2 + cyclophosphamide 1.5g/m 2 followed by a single infusion of CAR T cells at a dose of 1x10 6 CAR + T cells. Patients were monitored for the presence of CAR T cells in the blood by flow cytometry and by qPCR for the 41BBz junctional region, as well as circulating B cell count monthly for 6 months and then 6 weekly to 1 year. Disease status was assessed in the bone marrow morphologically, by IgH qPCR, as well as by flow cytometric assessment of MRD at the same time-points to establish durability of responses as a stand-alone therapy. The primary end-points were incidence of grade 3-5 toxicity related to CAR T cells within 30 days and the proportion of patients achieving molecular remission. Results: We have enrolled 10 patients and treated 8 to date. Six of 8 had relapsed post myeloablative SCT. The median disease burden prior to lymphodepletion was 9% blasts (ranging from molecular CR to 74% blasts, Table 1). It was possible to generate a product meeting release criteria in all but 1 patient (90% feasibility). Median transduction efficiency was 18.1% (range 6.7 to 76.3%). All treated patients received the anticipated dose of 1x10 6 CAR T cells/kg. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in all patients (grade 1 n=4 , grade 2 n=4 ), but to date none have developed \u2265 grade 3 CRS, required ICU admission or therapy with Tocilizumab. CRS was associated with modest elevations of IL-6, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 and resolved spontaneously in all. Grade 2 neurotoxicity was observed in 3 patients and resolved spontaneously, but no severe (\u2265grade 3) neurotoxicity was seen. Five patients had prolonged grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 30 days but this resolved in all by 2 months. Only 1 patient experienced significant infective complications in the context of pre-existing poor marrow reserve following allogeneic SCT. 6/7 (86%) evaluable patients achieved molecular remission at a median of 30 days post infusion (range 30-60 days, Table 1). One patient did not respond and died of CD19 + disease progression. At a median follow-up of 5.9 months (range 28-328 days), 4/7 evaluable patients remain in flow MRD negative remission of whom 3 show no evidence of molecular MRD at 1, 7.5 and 9 months. Two patients relapsed with CD19 - disease at 3 and 4 months post infusion: 1 of these remains alive with disease at 11 months and the other died of disease progression. Reflecting our pre-clinical data with CAT-41BBz CAR, we have seen excellent CAR T cell expansion (median 65459 copies/\u00b5g DNA at 1 month, range 609 to 230112) and persistence at up to 11 months post-infusion (Figure 1). All 7 evaluable patients have ongoing CAR T cell persistence detectable by both flow and qPCR as well as ongoing B cell aplasia at last follow-up. Conclusions: These interim results with a novel low affinity CD19 CAR show similar remission rates to those reported by US studies in paediatric ALL with an improved safety profile. No severe (grade \u22653) CRS or neurotoxicity has occurred to date despite high tumour burden in 4 patients. Excellent CAR T cell expansion has been documented, as well as long duration of CAR T cell persistence and associated B cell aplasia.
