    "abstract_text": "Background Anemia is common in patients (pts) with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-associated myelofibrosis (MF). Furthermore, anemia is an on-target effect of therapeutic Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibition, and may be the most frequent cause of ruxolitinib (rux) discontinuation (d/c) in clinical practice (Kuykendall, Ann Hematol 2018). Current therapies for anemia of MF (erythropoietin and analogs, danazol, IMiDs\u00ae) are unsatisfactory. Sotatercept (ACE-011) is a first-in-class, activin receptor type IIA ligand trap that may improve anemia by sequestering stromal transforming growth factor beta superfamily ligands that suppress terminal erythropoiesis (Iancu-Rubin, Exp Hematol 2013). Methods This is a phase 2, investigator-initiated, open-label, single institution study of sotatercept, administered subcutaneously every 3 weeks, in 2 cohorts of anemic pts (Hgb <10 g/dl on every determination for 12 weeks (wks) or transfusion-dependent (TD) per IWG-MRT criteria (Tefferi, Blood 2013)) with MF: as a single agent, and in combination with a stable dose of rux. Pts on rux must have been on rux for \u22656 months with a stable dose for \u22658 weeks, and receive sotatercept at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg. Monotherapy pts receive either 0.75 or 1 mg/kg of sotatercept. In both cohorts, anemia response is defined as achievement of transfusion independence (TI) in TD pts, and an increase in Hgb level from baseline of \u22651.5 g/dl sustained for \u226512 wks in non-TD pts (Gale, Leuk Res 2011). Pts must have received \u22655 cycles of sotatercept to be response-evaluable. Results A total of 53 pts have been treated; one pt received only 0.3 mg/kg of sotatercept and is not considered further. Thirty one pts received sotatercept alone and 21 in combination with rux. Baseline characteristics appear in Table 1, panel A. Sixteen TD and 15 non-TD pts received sotatercept alone for a median of 5 (1-67) cycles. Thirteen pts received 0.75 mg/kg and 18, 1 mg/kg. Seven of 24 (29%) evaluable pts responded. Of these, 4 were anemia responses; 3 TD pts achieved TI. Five responses occurred at the 0.75 mg/kg dose, and 2 at the 1 mg/kg dose. Median time to response (TTR) was 21 (1-22) days and median duration of response (DOR) 13 (3.9-56.4) months. Seven pts (22.6%) received <5 cycles and were not response-evaluable: 2 proceeded to stem cell transplant (SCT), 2 had logistical (travel) issues, and 1 each d/ced sotatercept because of hypertension (HTN), unrelated medical problems and pt decision. Three pts continue on study. Reasons for d/c included no response (11), progressive MF (6), SCT (3), travel logistics (3), patient decision (2), hypertension (1), unrelated medical complications (1) and transformation to AML (1). The combination cohort comprised 15 non-TD pts and 6 TD pts. The median number of cycles was 8 (2-43). Five of 17 (29%) evaluable pts in the combination cohort responded, all non-TD pts. Median TTR was 14 (7-147) days and median DOR 34.6 (3.1-47.9) months. Four pts (19%) received <5 cycles and were not response-evaluable, 1 each due to MF progression, loss of insurance, SCT and pt decision. Five pts remain on study. Reasons for d/c included no response (6), SCT (4), progressive MF (2), travel logistics (2), loss of insurance (1) and pt decision (1). Several non-response-evaluable pts in both cohorts achieved \u22651.5 g/dl increments in Hgb from baseline that were not sustained for \u226512 wks because of early d/c of sotatercept. An additional pt in the combination cohort required a rux dose increase, leading to failure to sustain a \u22651.5 g/dl Hgb improvement. Across both cohorts, several responding pts required multiple protocol-specified drug holidays because of Hgb levels \u226511.5 g/dl, with resumption of sotatercept once Hgb was <11 g/dl. Sotatercept was well-tolerated (Table 1, panel B). Grade 3 adverse events possibly related to sotatercept were HTN (n=7), limb (bone/muscle/joint) pain (n=3) and headache (1). Conclusions Sotatercept is safe and effective against anemia of MPN-associated MF, both in non-TD and TD pts, with a response rate of 29% both when used alone and in conjunction with a stable dose of rux. A total of 60 pts are planned to be treated on this trial (NCT01712308).
