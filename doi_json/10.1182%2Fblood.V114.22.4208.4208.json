    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4208 Severe congenital factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease of with a low prevalence in the general population (3-5 cases per million), associated with generally severe hemorrhagic diathesis, where the presence of intracraneal hemorrhage (ICH) is much higher than in other coagulopathologies such as hemophilia A or B. However, the basic coagulation tests are normal, which could delay the diagnosis. We present three cases of severe congenital FXIII deficiency (not diagnosed when referred to our center) with severe hemorrhagic pathology. These patients had normal basic coagulation tests and did not have a family bleeding history. The table show the results. Table  . Patient 1 . Patient 2 . Patient 3 .

View Large COMMENTS Congenital Factor XIII deficiency, although infrequent, should be included in the differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic processes with normal coagulation tests, especially if triggered spontaneously or in a disproportionate manner (in quantity and/or duration). Bleeding of the umbilical cord in the first days or weeks after birth is characteristic of this deficiency (present in 80% of cases). The prophylactic administration of Factor XIII is fundamental due to the frequency of intracranial hemorrhaging. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
