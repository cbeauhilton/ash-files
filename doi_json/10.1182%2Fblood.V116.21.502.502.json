    "abstract_text": "Abstract 502 Natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is significantly decreased relative to that in normal controls (NC). TGF-\u03b21 is a potent inhibitor of NK cell cytotoxicity. We considered the possibility that suppression of NK cell activity in AML patients is mediated by leukemia blast-derived microvesicles (MV) via TGF-\u03b21. Sera of 19 patients newly diagnosed with AML prior to any treatment were used to isolate MV by ultracentrifugation. MV from AML patients were positive for the blast-associated markers (CD33, CD34, CD117) by flow cytometry and for membrane-associated TGFb-1 in Western blots, whereas neither these markers nor TGFb-1 were detected in MV from NC. The protein content of blast-derived MV was higher (p<0.001) than that of MV isolated from sera of 25 NC (75\u03bc g\u00b112/mL vs 1.2\u03bc g\u00b10.4/mL). To evaluate MV-mediated NK cell suppression, NK cells obtained from NC were co-incubated with MV isolated from patients' sera. A significant decrease (p<0.002) in NK cell cytotoxicity (2412 LU pre- vs 1640 LU post co-incubation) was accompanied by a concomitant decrease (p<0.004) in the NK-cell activating receptor, NKG2DR, expression levels. To determine whether MV-associated TGF-\u03b21 was responsible for these adverse effects of MV on NK cells, neutralizing anti-TGF-\u03b21 mAb was added to the co-cultures. This mAb significantly abrogated MV-mediated inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity and down-regulation of the NKG2DR expression level. We next measured the plasma concentrations of TGF-\u03b21 in AML patients and NC. The mean \u00b1 SD plasma concentration of TGF-\u03b21 was 2,600 pg/mL \u00b1 2,500 in patients vs. 101 pg/mL \u00b1 55 in NC (p<0.0001). The use of urea, which disassociated membrane-bound TGF-\u03b21 in MV, resulted in a significant increase of the measured TGF-\u03b21 levels (mean 13,700 pg/mL \u00b1 9,800) only in the sera of AML patients but not in the sera of NC. To determine whether the SMAD pathway used by the TGF-\u03b2 family members is involved in the MV-NK cell interactions, we co-incubated NK cells with MV isolated from sera of AML patients. These MV induced SMAD phosphorylation in NK cells. The addition of anti-TGF-\u03b21 mAbs to the co-culture inhibited SMAD phosphorylation but did not alter expression of the SMAD protein itself. These data provide evidence for a novel mechanism responsible for down-regulation of NK cell activity and NKG2DR expression levels by TGF-\u03b21 associated with leukemia blast-derived MV in AML patients.
