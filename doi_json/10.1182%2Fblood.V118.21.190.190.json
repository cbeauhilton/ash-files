    "abstract_text": "Abstract 190 Signal transduction mediated by the kinases and phosphatases are critical for platelet activation at the site of vascular injury. Compared to the kinases, a role for phosphatases in platelet activation is less understood. Our previous studies have focused on the roles of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) in regulating integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 functions. However, platelets also express protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) and its role in platelet function is unexplored. PP2B-A\u03b1 and PP2B-A\u03b2 constitute two ubiquitous isoforms of the PP2B catalytic subunit. Due to the general concerns regarding the specificity of the PP2B inhibitors, we have utilized mice deficient in the \u03b2 isoform of the catalytic subunit of PP2B (PP2B-A\u03b2) to explore the role of PP2B in platelet functions. Mice lacking PP2B-A\u03b1 are short lived and are not considered in this study. Loss of PP2B-A\u03b2 did not cause any compensatory increase in the PP2B-A\u03b1 levels in platelets. Compared to the wild type (WT) platelets, PP2B-A\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 platelets displayed increased aggregation in response to low doses of protease-activated receptor 4-activating peptide (PAR4-AP), ADP, collagen and collagen related peptide (CRP). Enhanced \u03b1 granule secretion in response to the low doses of PAR4-AP and CRP was noticed in PP2B-A\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 platelets, relative to the WT platelets. Functions regulated by the outside-in \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 integrin signaling like adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen and fibrin clot retraction were enhanced in the PP2B-A\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 platelets. These studies indicate that PP2B-A\u03b2 negatively regulate platelet functions in vitro . Consistent with these observations, PP2B-A\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited a shorter tail bleeding time compared to the WT mice. In a FeCl 3 induced endothelial denudation injury model, PP2B-A\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed decreased time to occlusion in the carotid artery, and reduced number of emboli compared to the WT mice. These studies indicate that PP2B-A\u03b2 suppress multiple murine platelet functions that contribute to an occlusive thrombi. Unlike a positive thrombus promoting role for the PP1c\u03b3 that was noticed in our previous study, PP2B-A\u03b2 suppressed murine platelet activation, suggesting that different subtypes of Ser/Thr phosphatases have distinct roles in murine platelet activation.
