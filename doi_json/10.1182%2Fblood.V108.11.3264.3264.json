    "abstract_text": "CIK cells are ex-vivo expanded cells with MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity against several tumors, except B-lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Transduction of an anti-CD19-\u03b6 chimeric receptor (cTCR) in CIK cells renders them efficient killers of ALL cells. However, in order to be fully effective for ALL immunotherapy, CIK cells should be able to exert a prolonged anti-leukemic activity after infusion, proliferating and secreting cytokines which amplify the anti-tumoral immune response following ALL encounter. Since it has been shown that incorporation of costimulatory molecules into cTCRs markedly enhances target-cell stimulated proliferation and cytotoxicity in T lymphocytes and NK cells, our aim was to identify costimulatory molecules able to increase the anti-leukemic properties of anti-CD19-\u03b6 cTCR transduced CIK cells. CIK cells were efficiently transduced with the retroviral vectors carrying different types of cTCRs: anti-CD19-\u03b6, anti-CD19-DAP10, anti-CD19-4-1BB-\u03b6 and anti-CD19-CD28-\u03b6 (average expression of GFP and cTCR, 55% for all vectors tested; n=5 each). CIK cells expressing anti-CD19-\u03b6, anti-CD19-DAP10, anti-CD19-4-1BB-\u03b6 and anti-CD19-CD28-\u03b6 cTCRs were all strongly cytotoxic against OP-1 cells after 4 hours of incubation (>60% of lysis at E: T ratio 2:1 for all receptors tested). The benefit of adding the costimulatory molecules 4-1BB or CD28 to the cTCR was evident in long-term co-coltures (6days) on a mesenchimal cells layer, with low percentages of CIK cells (E:T ratio 0.01:1). In these assays, CIK cells expressing anti-CD19-4-1BB-\u03b6 or anti-CD19-CD28-\u03b6 cTCRs had more potent cytotoxicity than cells expressing the anti-CD19-\u03b6 cTCR: average cell killing was 93% (range, 89\u201398%), 93% (87\u201397%), and 14% (3\u201324%), respectively (n=4, each; p=0.001). By contrast, addition of DAP10 to the cTCR did not improve cytotoxicity (average cell killing, 2%). Notably, CIK cells transduced with the anti-CD19-4-1BB-\u03b6 cTCR had higher proliferative capacity in cocultures with irradiated OP1 cells and low dose IL-2. The average fold increase after 2 weeks of colture was 2.6 (range, 2.4\u20133.0) for these cells, while expansion of cells transduced with anti-CD19-\u03b6 or anti-CD19-CD28-\u03b6 was 1.4 (1.3\u20131.5) and 1.7 (1.2\u20132.7), respectively (p=0.01). Moreover, inclusion of 4-1BB or CD28 in the cTCR caused a significant increase in cytokines release (Multiplex Flow Cytomix assay) from transduced CIK cells after 48h stimulation with irradiated OP-1 cells: in 3 different experiments, CIK cells expressing anti-CD19-4-1BB-\u03b6 or anti-CD19-CD28-\u03b6 cTCR, secreted respectively, 2- and 3-fold more IL-2 (2040 and 2980 pg/ml, p=0.05), 3- and 4-fold more TNF-\u03b1 (2000 and 2555 pg/ml, p=0.05), 4- and 3-fold more TNF-\u03b2 (813 and 578 pg/ml, p=0.005), 4- and 3-fold more IL-6 (325 and 230 pg/ml, p=0.05), 3- and 4-fold more IL-8 (1962 and 2480 pg/ml, p=0.05) compared to cells expressing anti-CD19-\u03b6 cTCR. However, OP-1 stimulation of anti-CD19-CD28-\u03b6 cTCR transduced CIK cells resulted in the release of significant higher amount of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 than CIK cells expressing the anti-CD19-4-1BB-\u03b6 cTCR (880 and 85 pg/ml, p=0.05). In conclusion, our results suggest that anti-CD19-4-1BB-\u03b6 cTCR represents the best tool to improve anti-leukemic activity of CIK cells for ALL immunotherapy, as it strenghtens their cytotoxicity against leukemic cells and notably, it induces transduced cell proliferation and secretion of immuno-stimulatory cytokines."
