    "abstract_text": "Background: Anti-CD20 B cell depleting agents are amongst the most commonly used immunotherapeutics employed in the treatment of haematological malignancy and autoimmune diseases. By inducing peripheral B cell aplasia, anti-CD20 depleting agents are hypothesised to significantly impair serological responses to neoantigens, including the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein within SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Seropositivity following SARS-CoV-2 is the strongest, measurable correlate of protection from severe COVID-19. Understanding the kinetics of B cell reconstitution and vaccine responsiveness following exposure to B cell depleting agents is essential to maximise vaccine efficacy in patients vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Methods: 80 patients with underlying haematological malignancy and 38 patients with underlying rheumatological disease previously treated with anti-CD20 B cell depleting agents were studied following their second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (median time to sampling: 46.5d, IQR: 33.8-63.3). Lymphocyte subset (CD4, CD8, CD19, CD56/16) enumeration was performed using 6 colour flow cytometry (BD Trucount). Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (The Binding Site, Human Anti-IgG/A/M SARS-CoV-2-ELISA). The relationship between immune reconstitution following B cell depletion and vaccine responsiveness was explored. Results: In the haematology cohort (median age 70y, IQR 60.3-76.0, 62.5% male), overall seropositivity following vaccination was 60.0%. Individuals on active chemotherapy had significantly lower seroprevalence than those vaccinated following the completion of chemotherapy (22.7% vs 74.1%, p<0.0001). In the rheumatology cohort (median age 65y, IQR 58.3-70.8, 39.9% male), overall seropositivity was 69.4%. In both cohorts, vaccine non-responders had significantly smaller populations of peripheral CD19+ B cells (haematology: 0.20 vs 0.02 x10 9 /L, p=0.004, rheumatology: 0.07 vs 0.01 x10 9 /L, p=0.03). The magnitude of the antibody response following vaccination did not differ between recipients of Tozinameran and Vaxzeveria in either cohort. Vaccine responsiveness was lower in the first 6 months following B cell depletion therapy; 42.9% in the haematology cohort and 33.3% in the rheumatology cohort, increasing to 100% and 75% respectively in individuals receiving their second dose 6-12 months following B cell depletion ( Figure 1 ). B cell reconstitution in the 7-12 month window following B cell depletion was faster in haematology compared to rheumatology patients (77.8% v 22.2% achieving normal B cell count, p=0.005) and associated with improved vaccine responsiveness. However, persistent immunodeficiency occurred in some haematology patients following completion of treatment: 25% of patients who had completed therapy at least 36 months previously failed to respond to vaccination. In this cohort of vaccine non-responders, 83.3% of individuals had B cell numbers within the normal range. These patients had all previously been treated for follicular lymphoma suggesting a specific mechanism for long-range secondary immunodeficiency in these patients. Conclusions: Serological responsiveness to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is poor during active chemotherapy for haematological malignancy and in the first 6 months following B cell depletion, regardless of underlying disease. Vaccine responsiveness significantly improves in the 7-12 month window following B cell depletion. Compared to haematology patients, B cell reconstitution is slower in rheumatology patients and associated with reduced vaccine responsiveness, possibly due to the use of additional concurrent disease-modifying anti-rheumatic therapies. Furthermore, long-term secondary immunodeficiency occurs in a minority of haematology patients. To maximise the efficacy from SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination and optimal utilisation of available vaccine doses, immunisations should be delivered at least 6 months following the administration of anti-CD20 depleting drugs.
