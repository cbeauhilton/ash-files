    "abstract_text": "Objective Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been used in preventing and treating acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), but the mechanism is not fully understood. Apoptotic bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) were showed could induce vivo recipient-mediated immunomodulation in mice GVHD model. We had demonstrated that, similar to BM-MSCs, human amniontic mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMSCs) exhibit potent immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activities but possess a higher proliferation activity and clearer stem cell properties in vitro. This study focuses on the immunoregulatory properties of apoptotic human amniontic mesenchymal stromal cells (apo-hAMSCs) in an inflammatory microenvironment. Methods hAMSCs from human amniotic membrane were cultured with tissue mass cell culture. The cell phenotype of the 3rd passage were detected by flow cytometry. Transwell co-culture experiments and cell-cell contact co-culture experiments were conducted, consisting of hAMSCs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA-PBMCs), as the positive control group. While other groups were PBMCs without PHA and hAMSCs(PBMCs+hAMSCs), PBMCs and PHA (PHA-PBMCs), hAMSCs and PBMCs. For apoptosis evalution, the morphological features of hAMSCs were recorded in different groups, and apo-hAMSCs were analyzed by flow cytometry at 24 hours. The production of Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), soluble human leukocyte antigen G (sHLA-G), Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1(TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in the co-culture supernatant was detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and kynurenine were dectected by spectrophotometer. CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) in PBMC were analyaed by flow cytometry. Result hAMSCs expressed CD105, CD73, CD90, while not CD19, CD34, CD45, CD11b, HLA-DR. In the group of hAMSCs and PHA-PBMCs, the number of hAMSCs reduced. The morphological features were that cells shrinked, turned round, separated from the bottle and suspended in supernatant. However, hAMSCs in the groups of hAMSCs+PBMCs and hAMSCs stayed the same. Apoptosis in hAMSCs cultivated with PHA-PBMCs via transwell or cell-cell contact experiment increased compared with the group of hAMSCs+PBMCs (P0.05). Evident difference of CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + Tregs was shown between hAMSCs with PHA-PBMCs and PHA-PBMCs (P<0.05). Conclusion Activated, but not resting, PBMCs induce extensive early apoptosis in hAMSCs. And apoptosis in hAMSCs need inflammatory microenvirenment. Apoptotic hAMSCs still have immunoregulatory effects in cytokines and immune cells.
