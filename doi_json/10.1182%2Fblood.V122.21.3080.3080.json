    "abstract_text": "Background Ibrutinib, a Bruton\u2019s Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor, is clinically effective in relapsed MCL and CLL, but responses are often partial and resistance eventually develops. To identify agents that synergize with ibrutinib, we performed an in vitro combinatorial drug screen and evaluated the most promising combinations in additional models. Methods Drug screens were performed in JVM2 and Z138 MCL cell lines, combining ibrutinib with a diverse panel of secondary agents inhibiting targets within the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway (SC514, PD325901, enzastaurin, R788, temsirolimus, dasatinib, idelalisib) and agents inhibiting targets outside the BCR pathway (ABT-199, bendamustine, carfilzomib, bortezomib, geldanamycin, panobinostat, PD0332991). Three doses (IC10, IC20, IC 30) for each drug were chosen and combined in a 3x3 format. Bliss Model of Additivity was used to quantitate synergistic cytotoxicity. Levels of cleaved PARP or Annexin V/PI staining were assessed for cell lines exposed to ibrutinib and synergistic agents, including bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ABT-199. The Ibrutinib + carfilzomib combination was further tested in MCL cell lines Rec1 and Jeko, in primary MCL and CLL patient (pt) samples, and in a MCL-SCID-hu mouse. Molecular analysis of the mechanistic interactions of the agents has been initiated using forward-phase antibody arrays (R and D Systems). Results Inhibitors of targets within the BCR pathway were ineffective at potentiating the effects of ibrutinib (magnitude of synergy ranging -12%-9% in Z138, -25%-8% in JVM2). However, substantial synergistic cytotoxicity was seen with some agents that target outside the BCR pathway (magnitude of synergy ranging -5%-37% in Z138, -17%-48% in JVM2). Notably, we observed robust and reproducible synergistic cytotoxicity by combining ibrutinib with proteasome inhibitors carfilzomib and bortezomib as well as BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199. The degree of synergyof ibrutinib + ABT-199 in MCL cell lines was durable across all 9 dosing combinations, (23-32% in Z-138, 10-26% in JVM-2). In CLL pt samples, ibrutinib + ABT-199 conferred modest synergy (10-20%) and near-complete cytotoxicity (61-70%). Flow cytometry for cleaved PARP demonstrated a high degree of apoptosis when combining ibrutinib with ABT-199 (94.5% in Z-138, 82.1% in Z-138). At optimal dosing, bortezomib conferred 19% synergy with ibrutinib in Z138 and 27% in JVM2. The best synergistic effect of carfilzomib and ibrutinib was 50% in Z138 and 65% in JVM2. The synergistic effect between carfilzomib and ibrutinib was maintained in Rec1 and Jeko MCL cell lines and in primary MCL pt samples. In CLL pt samples, ibrutinib + proteasome inhibition also conferred high degrees of total cytotoxicity (58-71% for carfilzomib, 42-62% for bortezomib). Flow cytometry for cleaved PARP or Annexin V/PI demonstrated increased apoptosis for ibrutinib +carfilzomib (92.3% in Z138, 61.2% in JVM2, 95% in Rec1, 90% in Jeko). The combination treatment increased the percent survival of MCL-SCID-hu mice in three-fold over single agent treatment in a 125-day trial. Preliminary analysis of proteomic changes induced by ibrutinib+ carfilzomib indicates synergistic alterations in cell cycle proteins and in apoptosis-regulating proteins, although the specific alterations differ between Z138 and JVM2 cell lines. Discussion While agents within the BCR pathway did not display synergistic cytotoxicity with ibrutinib in our drug screen, several agents outside the BCR pathway did synergize with ibrutinib, notably ABT-199, bortezomib, and carfilzomib in two MCL cell lines. For all three drug combinations, this effect appeared to be mediated via apoptosis. The synergistic effect of ibrutinib + carfilzomib was further studied in 2 additional MCL cell lines, 3 MCL pt samples, and CLL pt samples. MCL-SCID-hu mice demonstrated three-fold increased survival when treated in combination over animals treated with either agent alone. The identification of unexpected synergistic cytotoxic interactions between inhibitors of apparently unrelated pathways is a benefit of our combinatorial screening approach, although the molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The combination of ibrutinib with either proteasome or BCL-2 inhibition is proposed as promising novel treatments for MCL and CLL. A phase I/II clinical trial has been designed to test ibrutinib + carfilzomib in relapsed or refractory MCL and CLL.
