    "abstract_text": "Abstract 31 We reported that complement cascade (CC) is activated in bone marrow (BM) during mobilization of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and that CC clevage fragments direct egress of HSPCs from BM into peripheral blood (PB) ( Blood 2003;101,3784; Blood 2004;103,2071; Blood 2005;105,40 ). We also reported that C5 cleavage fragments play a crucial role in the mobilization process by: i) inducing proteolytic activity in the BM environment; ii) directing BM egress of granulocytes that \u201cpave a road\u201d for HSPCs; and iii) inducing secretion of cationic peptides from activated granulocytes that prime HSPC egress ( Leukemia 2009; in press ). In this study, we sought to determine which major chemottractant is present in PB that is responsible for egress of HSPCs and whether activation of CC plays some role in its level/expression. We noticed that plasma derived from normal and mobilized PB strongly chemoattracts murine and human HSPCs. This chemotactic effect was not dependent on plasma SDF-1 levels because: i) it occurs unaffectedly in the presence of CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100; ii) it was still robust to heat-inactivated sera; and iii) ELISA studies revealed negligible concentrations of SDF-1, which did not correlate with good or poor mobilizer status. However, to our surprise, we noticed that plasma isolated from G-CSF-mobilized mice and patients contains traces of free hemoglobin, which suggests some level of hemolysis occurs in mobilized PB. As such, we performed chemotactic assays in the presence of different concentrations of lysed erythrocytes and noticed that such diluted lysates are potent chemoattractants for HSPCs. The chemotactic activities of these lysates were resistant to heat inactivation similarly as patient sera. Based on this, we focused on S1P, a thermo-resistant lipid that, as reported, chemoattracts HSPCs and whose major reservoirs are erythrocytes ( FASEB J 2007:21;1202 ). In fact we found by ELISA that S1P level increases during mobilization in PB and that SP1 is the most potent chemoattractant for BM-residing HSPCs, much stronger than SDF-1 - if both compounds are compared in physiologically relevant concentrations. Furthermore, activation of S1P receptors on BM-derived HSPCs augmented responsiveness to SDF-1 gradient up to 50%. However, these chemotactic effects of S1P were not visible for previously mobilized PB or umbilical cord blood HSPCs, which we explain by a fact that these mobilized cells are already desensitized to S1P gradient. Therefore, we propose the following scenario. First, a mobilizing agent (e.g., G-CSF) induces activation of CC in BM that subsequently contributes to the release of protelolytic enzymes from granulocytes that perturb SDF-1-CXCR4/VLA-4-VCAM1 interactions and stimulate egress of activated granulocytes from BM that \u201cpave a road\u201d for egress of HSPCs. Simultaneously, the final product of CC activation (C5b-C9), the membrane attack complex (MAC), induces in BM sinusoids the release of S1P from erythrocytes. S1P accumulating in BM sinusoids and cationic peptides released from activated granulocytes, but not changes in plasma SDF-1 levels, are crucial executors of HSPCs egress from BM into PB . Thus, our results provide novel evidence that CC activation/membrane attack complex (MAC)-induced elevated plasma S1P level is essential for egress/mobilization of HSPCs.
