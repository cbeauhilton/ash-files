    "abstract_text": "Emp, e rythroblast m acrophage p rotein, was originally detected in erythroblasts and macrophages, which form erythroblastic islands during erythropoiesis in the human bone marrow. The physical contact between erythroblasts and macrophages was suggested to promote the terminal maturation of erythroblasts, leading to their enucleation in vitro . To evaluate the function of Emp in vivo , we employed gene targeting studies to develop an Emp(\u2212/\u2212) mouse model. Mouse embryonic stem cells containing a gene-trap insertion in Emp were obtained from BayGenomics. Insertion of the gene-trap vector into Emp was verified by direct sequencing of cDNA obtained by 5\u2032RACE. Chimeric mice generated by blastocyst microinjection were intercrossed, and the offspring were genotyped by PCR and Southern hybridization. The Emp (+/\u2212) mice were healthy and fertile. However, no live Emp (\u2212/\u2212) mice were found among the progeny of the Emp (+/\u2212) intercrosses. Analysis of timed pregnancies revealed that Emp (\u2212/\u2212) embryos were present at a frequency roughly consistent with Mendelian inheritance throughout the embryonal stages. Homozygous Emp (\u2212/\u2212) embryos were small and pale compared to their littermates, and they survived embryonic development but died at birth. To determine the effect, if any, of Emp gene deletion on definitive hematopoiesis, livers of +/+, +/\u2212, and \u2212/\u2212 embryos at E15.5 were examined after H&E and Giemsa staining of paraffin-embedded serial sections, and cytospins. We found few mature erythroid cells in the sinusoids of homozygotes, in contrast to those of either wild-type or heterozygotes, where abundant enucleated red blood cells were observed. Although nucleated erythrocytes were found in both wild-type and mutant embryos, their relative proportions were very different: the less mature forms (proerythroblasts) predominated in the \u2212/\u2212 embryos whereas the more mature forms (polychromatophilic/orthochromatic and enucleated erythrocytes) were most common in +/+ and +/\u2212 embryos. Furthermore, erythroblastic islands consisting of a central macrophage surrounded by developing erythroblasts were seen in the cytospin preparations of wild-type and heterozygote livers but not in those of homozygous null livers. Since fetal liver macrophages (FLMs) are indispensable for definitive erythropoiesis, we investigated the effect that Emp\u2019s absence might have on development of FLMs. The E15.5 fetal liver sections were stained with the macrophage-specific F4/80 antigen. Numerous F4/80-positive macrophages were present throughout the liver of normal embryos whereas, the number was substantially reduced in Emp (\u2212/\u2212) liver. In summary, in the absence of Emp, FLMs are significantly reduced and terminal maturation of erythroid cells is negatively affected. Thus, the availability of Emp(\u2212/\u2212) embryos will provide a unique experimental model to study the function of macrophages in definitive erythropoiesis.",
