However, no reports have addressed whether ALC at the time of first relapse (ALC-R) has a prognostic significance in the patients with relapsed T-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). We retrospectively studied the prognostic significance of ALC-R in these patients. Patients and Methods: We identified 63 patients who had a documented relapsed disease after having reached a complete response, including at least an unconfirmed complete response between 1993 and 2007 and we analyzed their ALC-R and following variables at the time of first relapse; age, gender, the number of extranodal sites, lactate dehydrogenase, ECOG performance status, stage and international prognostic index. Results: Out of the 63 patients, 23 (36.5%) had a peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise characterized, while 15 (23.8%) had an extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, 6 (9.5%) anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, 5 (7.9%) angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, 2 (3.2%) primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma and 12 (19%) other types. Among them, 32 (50.8%) had an ALC-R \u2265 1.25 \u00d7 10 9 /L, 47 (74.6%) had an ECOG PS 0 or 1 and by IPI at relapse, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 20.6%, 25.4%, 23.8%, 23.8%, 4.8%, and 1.6%, respectively. Univariate analyses showed that good ECOG PS (HR, 0.408; 95% CI 0.190-0.876; p =0.022) and high ALC at relapse (HR, 0.394; 95% CI 0.210-0.740; p =0.004) were associated with longer survival from relapse ( Table 1 ). Multivariate analysis also showed that high ALC at relapse (HR, 0.369; 95% CI 0.187-0.726; p =0.004) and good ECOG PS (HR, 0.295; 95% CI 0.131-0.666; p =0.003) were still associated with longer survival outcome ( Table 2 ). Conclusions: The high ALC-R predicted a better prognosis in patients with relapsed T-cell NHL, suggesting that the host immune system might have a crucial role. Table 1.
