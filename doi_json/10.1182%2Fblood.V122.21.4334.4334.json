    "abstract_text": "Programmed death 1 (PD-1) is a T cell co-inhibitory receptor with two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. In B-cell malignancies, this pathway plays a major role in immune resistance in the tumor environment by promoting the differentiation of regulatory T-cells and inducing T-cell exhaustion. Recent data have shown that blockade of this pathway can enhance antitumor immune responses. While interactions between PD-1 and its ligands have been studied in various lymphoid tissues, little data exist regarding these interactions in the bone marrow, particularly in patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM). The goal of this study was therefore to determine the expression of PD-1 and its ligands in the bone marrow of patients with WM and to assess the functional role of PD-1 signaling in this disease. Using immunohistochemistry, the expression of PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 in bone marrow (BM) specimens from patients with WM (n=6) was compared to normal control BM. PD-1 expression was modest and the pattern of staining in WM was similar to normal BM. In contrast however, intense staining for PD-L1 and PD-L2 was seen in WM compared to controls. When analyzed by flow cytometry, PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression was seen on malignant B-cells and also on dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages isolated from the bone marrow. To determine the functional effect of PD-1 signaling in WM, we stably transfected PD-L1 and PD-L2 into the HEK-293 cell line. The WM cell lines, MWCL-1, BCWM.1 and RPCI-WM1 as well as patient specimens, were then cocultured with either the PD-L1 or PD-L2 expressing HEK-293 cells. When compared to cells expressing an empty vector control, proliferation and viability of WM cells was increased when they were cocultured with cells expressing PD-L1 or PD-L2. Addition of blocking antibodies abrogated the increase in proliferation. These results show that PD-L1 and PD-L2 are highly expressed on both malignant B-cells and non-malignant cells within the BM microenvironment in WM and promote malignant B-cell growth. Inhibition of PD-1 signaling may therefore be a promising therapeutic strategy in patients with WM. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
