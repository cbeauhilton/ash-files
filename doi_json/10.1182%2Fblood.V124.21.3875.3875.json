    "abstract_text": "Introduction Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for older individuals with hematologic malignancies has been performed with a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen due to lower treatment-related mortality (TRM) associated with this approach; however, the optimal conditioning regimen for these individuals remains unclear. Methods We analyzed 163 patients, 55 years or older with hematologic malignancies (127 AML/MDS, 19 lymphoma, 11 ALL, 6 other) who underwent 1 st allo-HSCT with fludarabine-melphalan-based conditioning between 01/2000-04/2014. All patients achieved complete remission (CR) at the time of transplant (13 patients were beyond 2 nd CR). Donors were HLA matched related (MRD), matched unrelated (MUD), and mismatched (related and unrelated) (MMD) in 56 (34.3%), 65 (39.8%) and 42 (25.7%) patients respectively. Patients received fludarabine 120 mg/m 2 plus either melphalan 100 mg/m 2 (FM100; 61 patients) or melphalan 140 mg/m 2 (FM140; 102 patients). Patients who received mismatched transplants received also thiotepa 5-10 mg/kg or 2 Gy TBI. There was no statistical difference between characteristics of the two groups except more patients in the FM100 group received marrow stem cells (62.3% vs 33.3%, p<0.001). Results Median age was 62 years (range 55-76 years) (63 years in FM100 vs 62 years in FM140 group, p=0.458). Median follow-up for 82 survivors was 36.5 months. Of 163, 155 patients engrafted (98.4% in FM100, 93.1% in FM140, p=0.385) with median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment of 12 days and 15 days, respectively. All of these 155 patients remained in continuous CR at 3 months post-transplant. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) at day 100 and 1 year of the entire cohort was 11.3% and 25.9%, respectively. Comparing the FM100 with the FM140 group, TRM at 1 year was 20.4% vs 26.9% (p=0.046); cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse at 3 years was 29.4% vs 35.4% (p=0.491); 3-year OS was 59.5% vs 42.3% (p=0.012); 3-year PFS was 54.6% vs 38.9% (p=0.024) (Figure1); CI of acute GVHD all grades was 23.2% vs 35.7% (p=0.039) while CI of acute GVHD grade2-4 was 15.3% vs 22.8% (p=0.024). There was no significant difference in chronic GVHD (40.1% vs 43.7%, p=0.745) or chronic extensive GVHD (20.5% vs 25.1%, p=0.356). In subgroup analysis of 46 patients with high-risk cytogenetics AML/MDS, FM140 was associated with better PFS compared with FM100; 3-year PFS was 32.9% vs 16.3% (p=0.046) (Figure2). The better PFS resulted from lower relapse rate (3-year CI of relapse was 29.2% in FM140 vs 53.8% in FM100 group, p=0.039) while TRM was not different (1-year TRM 20.5% in FM140 vs 21.7% in FM140 group, p=0.876). Factors associated with poor PFS in univariate analysis were high-risk cytogenetics, transplant in beyond 1 st CR, and grade 2-4 acute GVHD while using FM100 and MRD associated with a better PFS. However, only high-risk cytogenetics (HR 1.69, 95%CI 1.04-2.74, p=0.031), FM100 (HR 0.74, 95%CI 0.53-0.91, p=0.048), and acute GVHD grade 2-4 (HR 1.57, 95%CI 1.01-2.46, p=0.048) retained their statistical significance in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Allo-HSCT with reduced doses of melphalan (FM100) is associated with improved survival in elderly patients with hematologic malignancies due to lower TRM in this group. Patients with high-risk cytogenetics AML/MDS appear to have better survival with more intense conditioning (FM140) due to lower relapse rate. These results suggest that a differential approach should be applied to transplant conditioning, not only based on age but also based on disease type, and provide the basis for a future personalized approach for transplant conditioning in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
