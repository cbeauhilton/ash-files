    "abstract_text": "Introduction: A recent phase I/II study of blinatumomab in children with relapsed/refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL), found 39-51% achieved complete, often MRD negative, remission after two cycles of therapy. Higher responses were observed in patients with less than 50% bone marrow blasts, compared to greater than 50% (55.6% vs 32.7% (95% CI 30.8-78.5 and 20.3-47.1 respectively) 1 . Furthermore, an adult study showed complete minimal residual disease (MRD) response rates of 78% when blinatumomab was used to treat MRD-positive ALL in haematological remission 2 . Hence response rates (and toxicity) to blinatumomab are highly correlated with pre-treatment disease burden. We present preliminary data showing an excellent response to blinatumomab in children and young adults with resistant B-ALL who had persistent MRD, or after debulking chemotherapy to achieve a partial remission. Methods: Eleven patients were identified through a national survey. The mean age of patients was 10 years (range 0.7-22 years, 3 infants and 1 Down syndrome ALL). All patients had B-lineage ALL which was CD19 positive. None had active CNS disease at the point of receiving blinatumomab. Prior to administration of blinatumomab, all patients either had persistent MRD following several courses of intensive chemotherapy or received debulking chemotherapy for heavier marrow infiltrates. Pre-blinatumomab chemotherapy to which the patients had failed to obtain an adequate MRD response included UKALL 2011 Regimens A or C, UKALL R3, Interfant 06 or NOPHO high risk blocks. Patients received 5-15 \u00b5g/m2 of blinatumomab for 1-2 cycles prior to definitive therapy. Results: Pre-blinatumomab, all patients except one were in morphological remission with MRD measurable by PCR (0.003-1%), the remaining patient had 9% marrow disease by morphology. After 1-2 cycles of blinatumomab all patients had negative MRD when measured by flow cytometry and/or by PCR, giving a 100% response rate. This was followed by Haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in nine patients and the remaining two are awaiting transplant. Further data on patient characteristics, CNS status, relapse and survival outcome are being collected and will be presented at the meeting. Minimal toxicity was observed; of the seven patients in whom toxicity data were available, three had grade 1 CRS, which resolved spontaneously without interruption of therapy or treatment with corticosteroids or Tocilizumab. One patient reported grade 1 neurotoxicity. This preliminary UK experience demonstrates that excellent MRD response is observed with minimal toxicity in children and young adults who receive blinatumomab for persistent MRD or after debulking chemotherapy. This provided a bridge to transplant in patients who would otherwise not have benefited from the procedure because of persistent MRD. We are planning to extend these observations by undertaking a study of this strategy in first high-risk B-ALL relapse. Stackelberg Av, Locatelli F, Zugmaier G, et al.
