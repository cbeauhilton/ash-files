    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4201 Graft versus Host Disease (G v HD) is a potentially devastating complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) initiated in part due to donor-recipient disparities in immunoreactive proteins, or minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAgs). There are no established prognostic tools to predict which patients will get acute or chronic G v HD. Analysis of mHAg mismatch is a potential predictive tool for G v HD; however, previous studies attempting to establish a relationship between mHAg mismatch and G v HD have been largely equivocal. Here we tested the hypothesis that analysis of an expanded set of mHAgs for mismatch in the G v H direction can be predictive of acute or chronic G v HD by NIH criteria. We additionally analyzed event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in the mHAg matched and mismatched subgroups. Recipient/donor pairs from 45 HLA-A, -B, -C, and DRB1 matched unrelated donor transplants from 2007\u20132011 were retrospectively typed for 19 mHAgs using an SSP-PCR typing kit (Minor Histocompatibility Antigen Typing Kit; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. EFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The relationship between mismatch and acute or chronic G v HD was described using Fischer's Exact Test. Cumulative incidence of treatment related mortality (TRM) was calculated using the Gooley Method. Two patients expired of early TRM and were excluded from the G v HD analyses. The rate of acute G v HD grades II-IV was 6 of 14 in those without a mHAg mismatch and 21 of 29 in those with a mismatch (43% versus 72%, P = 0.062). The rate of chronic G v HD was 8 of 14 in those without a mismatch and 10 of 29 in those with a mismatch (53% versus 34%, P = 0.140). The presence of a mismatch did not significantly impact EFS (P = 0.42) or OS (P = 0.26). The cumulative incidence of TRM at 24 months post transplantation was greater in patients with a mismatch (36% versus 13%). Two year OS was superior in patients who were conditioned with alemtuzumab (N = 24) and had a lower degree of mismatch (0\u20131 mismatch = 72% versus 2+ mismatches = 38%, P = 0.038). This study suggests the possibility of a relationship between mHAg mismatch and acute G v HD and TRM. Further study using this expanded mHAg analysis on a larger cohort of individuals would more adequately define the potential benefit of mHAg mismatch analysis in the context of unrelated donor HCT.
