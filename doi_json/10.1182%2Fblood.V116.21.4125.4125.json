    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4125 Background: With the exception of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas, which are thought to derive from follicular helper T cells, little is known about the cell of origin for the most common peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), PTCL-unspecified (PTCL-U). Following appropriate antigenic stimulation, nai\u0308ve CD4 + T helper (T H ) cells differentiate into effector cells that secrete T H cytokines under the transcriptional regulation of subset-specific transcription factors. Methods: PTCL-U patients (n=53) from a single institution were retrospectively identified and immunohistochemical analysis of Foxp3, T-bet and GATA-3 expression performed on diagnostic biopsy specimens. Immunohistochemical staining was reviewed in a blinded fashion by a hematopathologist and all specimens with greater than 10% staining were scored as positive. Transcription factor expression was correlated with patient characteristics and clinical outcomes. Results: GATA-3 expression was observed in 22 (42%) patients, T-bet expression in 17 (32%) patients and Foxp3 expression in 4 (7%) patients. In order to determine the prognostic significance of GATA-3 or T-bet expression, overall survival was compared between patients with GATA-3 (or T-bet) positive or negative tumors. The median overall survival (OS) was 2 years (95% confidence interval 0.7\u201312.8 years) for patients with GATA-3 negative tumors, compared with a median OS of 0.9 years (95% confidence interval 0.5\u20131.2 years, p=0.02) for GATA-3 positive cases. The median overall survival was 1.6 years (95% confidence interval 1.0\u20136.8 years) for patients with T-bet negative tumors, compared with a median overall survival of 0.7 years (95% confidence interval 0.3\u20130.9 years, p=0.005) for T-bet positive cases. As a subset of tumors coexpressed GATA-3 and T-bet, both of which are adverse prognostic factors, we examined survival outcomes between those patients with tumors expressing either GATA-3 or T-bet (n=29) and those with tumors which do not express either transcription factor (n=24). The median OS and PFS observed for patients with positive tumors was 0.7 years (95% confidence interval 0.6\u20131.1 years) and 0.7 years (95% confidence interval 0.5\u20130.9 years), respectively. In contrast, patients with GATA-3/T-bet negative tumors experienced markedly superior survival, with a median OS and PFS of 3.8 years (95% confidence interval 1.6\u201312.9 years, p60 years), poor performance status (ECOG performance status >1), and stage III/IV disease were also associated with inferior overall survival on univariate analysis. However, when adjusting for these latter adverse prognostic factors on multivariate analysis, GATA-3/T-bet expression remained an independent predictor of poor overall survival in PTCL-U (adjusted hazard ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 1.4\u20138.5, p=0.008). Similarly, when adjusting only for high-risk features (>2 adverse prognostic factors), as defined by the Prognostic Index in PTCL-U (PIT), GATA-3/T-bet expression remained an independent predictor of inferior overall survival on multivariate analysis (adjusted hazard ratio 4.9, 95% confidence interval 2.2\u201311.5, p<0.0001). Conclusions: GATA-3 and T-bet expression identify subsets of high-risk PTCL-U patients who may benefit from alternative treatment strategies.
