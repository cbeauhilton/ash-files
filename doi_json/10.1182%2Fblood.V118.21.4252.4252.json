    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4252 L-asparaginase has been a mainstay of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment since decades and its efficacy has been demonstrated in a broad range of patient's profiles. However its use is hampered by frequent and/or significant toxicities. L-asparaginase loaded in homologous red blood cells (GRASPA\u00ae) is a new pharmaceutical formulation of the enzyme. This cell-based medicinal product allows a better safety profile and an improvement of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the enzyme. As demonstrated by several teams performing different technologies of entrapment (Alpar-HO, 1985; Updike-SJ, 1985; Naqi-A 1988; Kravtzoff-R, 1996; Kwon-YM, 2010; Domenech-C, 2010), L-asparaginase remains active entrapped inside the red blood cell (RBC), while asparagine is constently and actively \u201cpumped\u201d through the membrane of the red cells thanks to N+ channel system. Thus, L-asparaginase loaded RBCs act as \u201ccellular bioreactors\u201d. Indeed, plasmatic asparagine diffuses through the RBC membrane to the intra cellular compartment where it is cleaved by the entrapped L-asparaginase. Thanks to the RBC membrane, the enzyme is protected from body reaction thus reducing the side effects. L-asparaginase loaded red blood cells is a cell-based medicinal product for personalized medicine. The physician prescribes the drug, then the hospital orders the product to the company. The patient weight, the ABO blood type and a valid irregular antibody screening (IAS) have to be joined with this order. The qualified person on the manufacturing site, orders immediately to a blood bank a leukocytes reduced packed RBC unit compatible with the patient. The product is manufactured under cGMP using a 3-hours automated process: (1) a washing step removes the preservative solution from the packed RBC, (2) L-asparaginase is mixed to the RBC washed suspension, (3) the mixture is dialyzed against a hypotonic solution and resealed, (4) a final washing step allows to purify the product, finally (5) the preservative solution is added. According to the prescribed dosage (IU/Kg), the volume of GRASPA\u00ae is adjusted in the final product PVC bag. Indeed, the product release specifications are constant and reproducible from batch to batch such as the corpuscular concentration of L-asparaginase (117\u00b119, IU/ml), extracellular hemoglobin (0.11\u00b10.03 g/dL), osmotic fragility (<3.5 g/L of NaCl), extracellular L-asparaginase (0.4\u00b10.2 IU/ml ie <1% of the total activity). Based on these specifications, the qualified person releases the product and ships it (kept at 2\u20138\u00b0C) to the prescriber, meaning the delay between order and delivery is less than 2 days. Currently a 72h shelf-life for the final product is considered. The traceability system assures the linkage between the blood bank and patient's hospital.

In ALL patients, hypersensitive reaction, coagulation disorders, hepatic disorders are significantly reduced. The dose of 150IU/kg is currently used in a phase II/III pivotal trial in children and adults with ALL relapse. The dose of 100 IU/kg is optimal (efficacy/tolerance) in newly diagnosed patients over 55yo. Indeed this frail subpopulation of patients can difficultly receive current forms of L-asparaginase due to the known side effects. A phase I clinical trial in pancreatic carcinoma confirmed the good safety profile (also at 150IU/kg) of this form of L-asparaginase even in solid tumors, offering new perspectives in patients where asparagine synthetase in tumor cells is down.
