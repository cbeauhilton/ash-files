    "abstract_text": "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been long regarded as being important in determining variation and disease predisposition. Recently, chromosomal structural variation in the form of deletions, insertions and duplifications have been identified frequently in the genome of the general population. Such copy number variations (CNVs) have been shown to contribute to a range of human diseases. In recent studies we have utilized Affymetrix 50K and 500K arrays to identify acquired copy number change in myeloma tumor samples. In those studies we had access to paired constitutional DNA and in the present study have been able to report for the first time a CNV map of the constitutional genome of myeloma patients. Affymetrix 500K mapping arrays were used to identify copy number changes in 63 paired samples using DNA from peripheral blood and CD138 selected plasma cells. Tumor samples were analyzed in CNAG using both a paired and unpaired analysis to distinguish between inherited and acquired copy number change. Constitutional DNA was analyzed by both CNAG and GEMCA using 90 Caucasian samples from the Hapmap database as a reference set. For maximum calling accuracy, only those regions identified by both algorithms were called as CNVs. As with similar studies, overlapping CNVs identified using this approach were merged to generate a list of CNV regions (CNVRs) characteristic of the constitutional DNA of these myeloma cases. Using this approach, we identified 292 CNVs across 63 cases, with a median of 4 regions per sample. There were 155 discrete CNVRs, of which 46 were recurrent. The recurrent CNVRs were found most frequently in the pericentric regions of chromosome 14 and 15 in keeping with other studies. We then compared these recurrent CNVRs with a comparable dataset of normal individuals generated using Affymetrix 500K arrays. In this analysis, 25/46 recurrent CNVRs in the myeloma cases were novel. The two most frequent novel CNVRs in the myeloma cases were gains on chromosome 21 and 15. We also compared the characteristics of the constitutional CNVs with the acquired copy number changes in the corresponding tumor samples and identified that the constitutional CNVs were generally considerably smaller. However, using unpaired analysis it was possible to determine the presence of the constitutional CNV in the tumor sample, providing validation of the CNVs. We were also able to demonstrate that acquired copy number change in the tumor cells can either exaggerate or ameliorate the effect of the inherited CNV in the tumor genome, such as cases with acquired trisomy 15 and deletion or gain of regions of 15q in the constitutional DNA. These findings also reinforce the need for paired non-tumor DNA when undertaking copy number analysis of tumor DNA using SNP arrays. In this study we have been able to identify for the first time the presence of CNVs in the constitutional genome of individuals with myeloma. We have been able to systematically catalogue these CNVRs. These results provide the basis for future studies aimed at identifying how this type of genomic variation may influence the development of and outcome of myeloma and a broad range of other hematological conditions."
