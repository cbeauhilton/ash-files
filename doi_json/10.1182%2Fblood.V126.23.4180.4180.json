    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Previous studies have shown that cPC can be detected in PB by conventional flow cytometry (FC) in around 70% of multiple myeloma (MM) and 37% of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) patients at diagnosis. Its presence in MGUS has been associated with a higher risk of malignant transformation. We here investigated the utility and sensitivity of the EuroFlow-IMF NGF-MM minimal residual disease (MRD) approach for detecting circulating cPC in PB of patients with PCN. Methods : A total of 137 samples (including 71 PB and 66 bone marrow -BM- paired samples) from 71 newly-diagnosed PCN patients (37 MGUS; 21 MM; 5 SMM and 8 solitary plasmacytomas -SP-), plus 6 PB samples from healthy controls, were studied. Samples were processed following the EuroFlow Bulk Lysis Standard Operating Protocol (SOP) and stained with the EuroFlow-IMF MM MRD panel (Tube 1:CD138 BV421 /CD27 BV510 /CD38 FITC /CD56 PE /CD45 PerCP-Cy5.5 /CD19 PE-Cy7 /CD117 APC /CD81 APC-C750 , and; Tube 2: identical to Tube 1 except for CyKappa APC/ CyLambda APC-C750 ). A median of 10.6 x10 6 events (range: 1.7 x10 6 - 15.7x10 6 ) were measured for PB samples using a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA) instrument. Data were analyzed using the Infinicyt software (version 1.8.0RC6; Cytognos SL, Salamanca, Spain). Risk stratification of MGUS patients was established by the Mayo Clinic index. ROC analysis was used to define a cut-off to distinguish between MM and MGUS cases according to the percentage and absolute number of circulating PB cPC. Results: Overall, cPC were detected in the PB of all MM and SMM cases studied (100%) and more than half of MGUS patients (60%; p=0.005), while constantly absent in the eight patients with SP. Upon classifying MGUS patients according to the Mayo Clinic Index (n=32), positive PB samples were found in 25%, 62% and 73% of cases with scores of 0, 1 and 2, respectively. Median (range) percentage and absolute cPC numbers (per \u00b5L) were of 13 to 16 and 10 to 200 times lower (p60% of cPCs within the PC BM compartment (R 2 = 0.75; n=66). The cut-off obtained to distinguish between MM and MGUS cases according to the percentage and absolute number of cPCs circulating in PB was of 0.0009% and 0.055 cPC/\u00b5L with a sensitivity of 93% and 86%, and a specificity of 75% and 75% for relative and absolute numbers, respectively. Conclusions: The EuroFlow-IMF NGF-MM MRD panel and approach are well-suited for high sensitive detection of circulating cPC in the PB of virtually every newly-diagnosed MM and SMM patient and the majority of MGUS cases, particularly among MGUS at higher risk of malignant progression; interestingly in both patients groups, the presence of PB involvement and its levels were closely associated with the degree of involvement of the BM PC compartment by cPC. * Both authors have contributed similarly to this work and they should both be considered as first author.
