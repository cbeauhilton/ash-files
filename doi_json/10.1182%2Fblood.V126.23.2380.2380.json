    "abstract_text": "Intron retention (IR), the least studied form of alternative splicing, has recently been shown to have important biological roles in a variety of cell types. While it can alter a gene's protein-coding sequence, it is becoming particularly well-known for its potential to impact gene expression by destabilizing mRNAs through the nonsense-mediated decay pathway or by promoting their retention in the nucleus. A complex, dynamic, and biologically important IR program has been described in maturing mammalian granulocytes, but it is unknown whether IR occurs broadly in other hematopoietic lineages. We therefore globally assessed IR in the mammalian erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages. Intron Retention Finder, a bioinformatics tool that measures IR in RNA-seq datasets, was used to analyze IR in primary cells of the erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages as well as their common progenitor cells. Both lineages exhibit an extensive differential IR program involving hundreds of introns and genes. Complex IR patterns were seen in murine erythropoiesis from the megakaryocytic-erythroid branch point throughout the terminal maturation stages. Within the terminally differentiating proerythroblast to orthochromatic erythroblast stages, hundreds of introns saw their retention level increase as cells differentiate while a smaller set exhibited an opposing trend. Similarly complex patterns including a dramatic IR increase in orthochromatic erythroblasts were observed during human terminal erythroid differentiation, but not involving the murine orthologous introns or genes. Despite the common origin of erythroid cells and megakaryocytes and their overlapping gene expression patterns, the megakaryocytic IR program is entirely distinct from that of the erythroid lineage with regards to introns, genes, and affected gene ontologies. This suggests that the dynamic IR patterns are not simply the result of general maturational changes, but rather may arise via lineage-specific mechanisms. Importantly, we observed an inverse relationship between IR and gene expression changes, supporting the hypothesis that IR serves to regulate mRNA levels. Our findings add a new dimension to the megakaryocyte and erythroid transcription programs by expanding the mechanisms of gene control to include this understudied form of alternative splicing.
