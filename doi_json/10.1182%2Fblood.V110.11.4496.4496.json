    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: mTOR inhibitors have been associated with responses in Mantle cell lymphoma and other lymphomas ( J Clin Oncol  23 ; 5347 , 2005 ). Phase I and II trials with the oral everolimus (RAD001, Novartis Pharmaceuticals) have demonstrated a favorable side effect profile. This phase II study tested everolimus in patients with relapsed/refractory Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM). METHODS: Patients who had at least one previous therapy for WM and who had relapsed or refractory disease were eligible. Other eligibility criteria included symptomatic disease, > 2 weeks from last therapeutic agent used, >10% involvement with lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow, IgM paraprotein > 2x upper limit of normal, absolute neutrophil count >1000/mm3 and platelet count >75,000/mm3, serum creatinine of < 2 x upper limit of normal. NCI CTCAE v3.0 was used for toxicity assessment. Response was assessed by criteria established at the second consensus panel for WM. All patients received 10mg RAD001 daily for 28 days per cycle for 6 cycles; response was assessed after 2 cycles. RESULTS: 10pts (8 men and 2 women, median age is 62 years, range 52\u201371) have been treated to date. The median number of lines of prior treatment was 3 (range 1 \u2013 5). The median IgM at baseline was 3970 mg/dL (range 3120\u2013 7410); median M-spike at baseline was 2.07 gm/dL (range 1.41 \u2013 4.02); and median hemoglobin was 11.3 g/dL (9.4\u201313.3). The median follow up was 4 months (range 1 \u2013 7 months). Prior therapy included rituximab, nucleoside analogues (fludarabine and 2-CDA), combination chemotherapy (e.g CHOP, CVP), chlorambucil. and bortezomib. Seven patients are currently evaluable for response. The best response to single agent RAD001 after 2 cycles is presented in Table 1. Median duration of response has not been reached. Patients tolerated RAD001 well without significant toxicities. The main toxicities observed were apthous ulcers in 4 patients. One patient required dose reduction due to mucositis. One patient stopped therapy within the first month of treatment and went on to hospice care before succumbing to his disease after one month. Attributable toxicities otherwise proved manageable with appropriate supportive care and RAD001 was generally well tolerated, with no peripheral neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Oral RAD001 as monotherapy has been well tolerated and demonstrates exciting activity achieving PR + MR in 57%, and/or stabilization of disease in 43% of evaluable patients with relapsed WM. Accrual of a total of 30 patients is rapidly ongoing. Updated data will be presented at the meeting. Table 1  Response . N=7; ORR (CR+PR+MR)= 57% . Median time to best response (months) .
