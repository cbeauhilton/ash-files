    "abstract_text": "The use of bortezomib (B), a first-in-class proteasome inhibitor, administered with or without dexamethasone (D) for treatment of systemic AL amyloidosis, was reported in two small preliminary series to result in high rates of hematologic (HR) and organ (OR) response. We report here the efficacy and toxicity of bortezomib among 94 patients with AL amyloidosis attending three European amyloidosis centers. Consensus criteria were used for assessment of amyloidotic organ involvement and treatment response. Ninety-four patients treated with B\u00b1D were identified in the three centers\u2019 databases. Median age at start of treatment was 62 years. Eighty-one percent had received prior chemotherapy (median 2 lines, range 1\u20136), including high dose melphalan in 12% and a thalidomide combination in 55%; 69% had clonal disease that had been completely refractory. The median number of amyloidotic organs was 2 (range 1\u20135); the heart was involved in 73% (62% had symptomatic CHF) and the kidneys in 75% of cases. Median serum creatinine was 1.3 mg/dL (range 0.4\u20138.9), and 12% were dialysis-dependent. The median serum concentration of amyloidogenic free light chains (FLC) was 183 mg/L (range 9\u20139464); serum NT-proBNP was >332 ng/L and >1266 ng/L in 81% and 64% patients respectively. B was administered according to standard schedule in 80% and weekly in 20%. Median dose of D per cycle was 80 mg; 10% of patients received B without D. Median number of treatment cycles was 4 (range 1\u20138). HR was achieved in 71% of patients, including CR in 25%; 67% of responding patients did so by the 3 rd month of treatment. HR was not related to prior treatment response although in untreated patients CR rates were higher (47% vs. 20%, p=0.074). In multivariate analysis HR was independently associated with age 30% following B treatment was associated with survival benefit.",
