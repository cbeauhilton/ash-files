    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1979 Poster Board I-1001 The X-borne transcription factor GATA-1 is essential for erythroid and megakaryocyte development. In 1986, Norman et al. (Vox Sang 51:49) described a large family in which the rare Lu(a-b-) blood group phenotype is inherited as the result of an X-borne gene. Serologic and flow cytometric analyses confirmed the suppression of Lutheran blood group antigens on the red blood cells from the original male propositus. Analysis of DNA from the propositus revealed a mutation (1240T>C) in the termination codon of GATA1 converting TGA to a codon for arginine (CGA). The mutation predicts a translated GATA-1 protein containing an additional 41 amino acids at the carboxy terminus. DNA from an unaffected sister of the propositus had a wild-type GATA1 sequence. The GATA1 mutation was not present in 78 random blood donors as determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis using BspHI. The propositus, who is now 64, has an Hb of 122 g/l, a low platelet count (86 \u00d7 10 9 /l) with occasional macrothrombocytes (diameter 4-5 um) and a history of bruising easily. Several mutations in the amino terminal zinc finger domain of GATA-1 have been linked with thrombocytopenia and thalassemia or dsyerythropoietic anemia and the presence of macrothrombocytes. Our data provide evidence that mutations outside the zinc finger domain can affect GATA-1 functions in erythroid and megakaryocyte differentiation. In this case, the predicted extended carboxy terminus may interfere with GATA-1 interactions involving other DNA-binding proteins. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
