    "abstract_text": "Some studies have suggested that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) offers a similar efficacy in terms of GVHD prophylaxis as compared to methotrexate (MTX) but a faster engraftment and a lower incidence of mucositis. We have analyzed the results of fludarabine (150 mg/m2) and melphalan (140 mg/m2) or busulphan (10 mg/m2) plus Cyclosporine (CsA) and MMF instead of MTX as GVHD prophylaxis in a series of 30 patients undergoing unrelated allogeneic transplantation. Median age was 44 years (18\u201360). Patients younger than 40 were required to have a previous comorbid condition (8 had a previous autologous transplant; 2 had proven fungal infection; 1 had severe altered lung capacity). Twelve patients were diagnosed with AML, 4 had ALL, 4 MDS, 2 CML, 3 CLL, 3 NHL, 2 MM/WM. Disease status at transplant was 1st or 2nd CR in 12 patients, >2nd CR or PR in 11 patients while the remaining patients had active disease at the time of transplant (relapse, refractory, untreated diasease). Median day to reach > 0,5 x 109 granulocytes / L was +17 and to reach > 20 x 109 platelets / L was +13. At a median follow up of 445 days among patients alive, projected overall survival (OS) and event free survival at 3 years are 47% and 30%, respectively. Overall TRM was 32%. Cumulative incidence of grades 2\u20134 and 3\u20134 aGVHD was 67% and 33%, respectively while cumulative incidence of extensive cGVHD was 70%. Gut was the organ most severely involved in aGVHD in 10 out of 16 patients while liver was involved in only 3 cases. Interestingly, among patients who developed aGVHD, incidence of skin (80%) and liver (22%) involvement were similar to that observed in a similar series of patients receiving related donor transplant using the same RIC plus CsA and MTX instead of MMF while the incidence of gut involvement was significantly higher (64% vs 42%). In conclusion, the RIC used in the current study plus CsA and MMF offers promising results in high risk patients. In terms of GVHD prophylaxis, MMF shows a good efficacy at skin and liver but poor at the gastrointestinal tract.",
