    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND Internal tandem duplication in the fms -like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor tyrosine kinase (FLT3-ITD) is present in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 30% of patients, associated with poor treatment outcomes due to rapid relapse. FLT3 inhibitors are used in the clinic, but with incomplete efficacy and development of resistance. Further treatment options are needed. The serine/threonine kinase proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (Pim-1) is upregulated downstream of FLT3-ITD; it directly stimulates cell growth and inhibits apoptosis, and also phosphorylates and stabilizes FLT3 in a positive feedback loop in cells with FLT3-ITD. Dual targeting of Pim-1 and FLT3 is a promising treatment strategy. The c-Myc transcription factor contributes to dysregulation of cell growth and apoptosis in cancers, including AML. In addition to transcriptional regulation, c-Myc is regulated post-translationally by T58 phosphorylation by the serine/threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3- \u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2). Here we show that concurrent treatment of cells with FLT3-ITD with Pim and FLT3 inhibitors activates GSK-3\u03b2, which phosphorylates and post-translationally downregulates c-Myc. METHODS Ba/F3-ITD and MV4-11 cells, with FLT3-ITD, and FLT3-ITD AML patient blasts were cultured with the pan-Pim inhibitor AZD1208 (1 \u03bcM) and/or the FLT3 inhibitors gilteritinib or quizartinib (15 nM, 1 nM), with and without the GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor TCG-24 (20 \u03bcM). c-Myc, p-GSK3-\u03b1/\u03b2 (S21/9) and GSK3-\u03b1/\u03b2 protein expression was measured by immunoblotting. c-Myc mRNA was measured by qPCR. Cells were also cultured with cycloheximide (100 \u03bcg/mL) with and without the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (20 \u03bcM) to measure protein half-life and proteasomal degradation. To study the role of c-Myc overexpression and activation, Ba/F3-ITD cells were infected with retroviral estrogen receptor (ER)-Myc plasmid, causing c-Myc nuclear translocation when activated by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT; 300 nM). To study the role of c-Myc phosphorylation at T58, Ba/F3-ITD cells were infected with MycT58A plasmid, preventing c-Myc phosphorylation at T58. Apoptosis was detected by Annexin V and propidium iodide staining, measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS Treatment with Pim inhibitor AZD1208 and FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib or quizartinib combination rapidly downregulated c-Myc protein expression in Ba/F3-ITD and MV4-11 cells, with FLT3-ITD, and in primary FLT3-ITD AML patient blasts, compared to quizartinib or gilteritinib alone. Pim inhibitor and FLT3 inhibitor combination treatment did not decrease c-Myc mRNA levels, but markedly decreased c-Myc protein half-life, from 36 mins without drugs and 24 mins with gilteritinib to 18 mins with combination. Half-life did not decrease when cells were pre-treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, consistent with post-translational downregulation through proteasomal degradation. Apoptosis induction by Pim inhibitor and FLT3 inhibitor combination decreased by more than 50% in Ba/F3-ITD cells infected with ER-Myc plasmid and treated with 4-OHT, demonstrating the major role of c-Myc downregulation in apoptosis induction by combination treatment. GSK-3b is inactivated by phosphorylation, and combination treatment rapidly decreased p-GSK-3b levels, while total GSK-3b levels were unchanged, indicating activation of GSK-3b. Treatment of cells with FLT3-ITD with the GSK-3b inhibitor TCG-24 in addition to Pim and FLT3 inhibitors abrogated c-Myc protein downregulation, demonstrating that Pim and FLT3 inhibitor combination downregulates c-Myc through activation of GSK-3b. Finally, Pim and FLT3 inhibitor combination treatment did not downregulate c-Myc in Ba/F3-ITD cells transfected with c-Myc T58A, preventing c-Myc phosphorylation at T58, showing that c-Myc phosphorylation at T58 is necessary for its downregulation by combination treatment. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent treatment of cells with FLT3-ITD with Pim kinase inhibitor enhances the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors through activation of GSK-3\u03b2 and GSK-3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation of c-Myc at T58, with resulting c-Myc downregulation through increased proteasomal degradation. This work and previous work in our laboratory on PP2A activating drugs and FLT3 inhibitor combination (Mol Cancer Ther 20:676, 2021) support GSK-3\u03b2 activation as a mechanism for enhancing efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in AML with FLT3-ITD.
