    "abstract_text": "Mammalian genomes encode tens of thousands of long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs). Accumulated evidence suggests that many of lincRNAs are expressed in a development- or tissue-specific manner. However, it remains largely unknown how lincRNAs reprogram lineage-specific gene expression and regulate lineage-specific differentiation processes during early embryonic development. It is also important to identify specific lincRNA(s) that is involved in early hematopoietic lineage formation and differentiation. Here, we reported a HoxB locus-associated lincRNA HOTSET that is conservatively expressed in both mouse and human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HS/PCs). During embryonic development, HOTSET RNA is dramatically induced upon embryoid body (EB) hematopoietic differentiation. Expression of HOTSET RNA is required for development of the mesoderm-derived Flk1 + bipotential precursors of blood and endothelium lineages and CD41 + /c-Kit + hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We demonstrated that HOTSET RNA directly interacts with the SET domains of Setd1a and MLL1 histone methyltransferases in a sense-strand dependent manner. HOTSET RNA directly binds to the HoxB1-6 gene promoters and recruits the Setd1a/MLL1 complexes to the anterior HoxB locus upon differentiation. Furthermore, HOTSET RNA mediated H3K4 methylation is essential for long-range chromatin loops that bring anterior HoxB genes into a close proximity with HOTSET RNA locus and for subsequent activation of anterior HoxB gene expression. In addition, knockdown of HOTSET RNA disrupts the recruitment of the Setd1a/MLL1 complexes, H3K4me3 levels, the three-dimensional chromatin architecture, and HoxB gene transcription at the HoxB gene cluster. Depletion of HOTSET RNA also impairs differentiation of the CD41 + /c-Kit + HS/PC population and hematopoietic transcription factor and signaling networks required for early hematopoietic differentiation. Importantly, re-expression of HoxB2-4 genes in the HOTSET -depleted embryoid bodies rescues the expression of core hematopoietic transcription factors as well as the Flk1 + mesoderm-derived precursors and CD41 + /c-Kit + HS/PCs that undergo hematopoietic differentiation. Thus, HOTSET plays an important role in early hematopoietic lineage commitment by shaping the three-dimensional chromatin landscape in the HoxB locus to activate anterior HoxB genes that subsequently modulate lineage-specific transcription networks during hematopoietic development.
