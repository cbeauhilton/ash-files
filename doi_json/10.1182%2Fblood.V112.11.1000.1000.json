    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: SGN-40 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD40. Upon binding to CD40, SGN-40 triggers pro-apoptotic signal transduction pathways and mediates effector cell functions (ADCC and ADCP). SGN-40 demonstrated preliminary anti-tumor activity in a phase 1 study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients (ASH 2006, Abstract 695). METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, phase 2, open-label study to determine the overall response rate and toxicity profile of SGN-40 in patients with relapsed DLBCL. Tumor samples were assessed by a central lab for pathology confirmation and CD40 expression. Eligible patients had de novo or transformed DLBCL at diagnosis and were excluded if previously treated for indolent lymphoma. Required prior therapy consisted of combination chemotherapy with rituximab and, if eligible, autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients received 6 intravenous infusions of SGN-40 over 5 weeks (Cycle 1) with intra-patient dose loading (1 mg/kg on Day 1; 2 mg/kg on Day 4; 4 mg/kg on Day 8) and 8 mg/kg/wk thereafter. Responding patients and those with stable disease were eligible to continue therapy until disease progression or a maximum of 12 cycles. RESULTS: Forty-six patients (28 M, 18 F), with a median age of 72 years (range 17\u201385), were enrolled at 10 centers in the US. Patients were heavily pre-treated, with a median of 4 prior systemic chemotherapy regimens (range 1\u201310). Immunohistochemistry analysis of patient tumor samples demonstrated high expression of CD40 in all patients with the exception of 1 patient who was negative. Thirty-eight of the 46 patients met predefined criteria for evaluation (completed dose loading and had no major protocol violations). Best responses seen were CR (n=2, 5%) and PR (n=2, 5%), yielding an ORR of 10%. Furthermore, 9 (24%) patients had SD as best response. Reductions in tumor size were seen in approximately one-third of patients. Twenty (53%) patients had PD and 5 (13%) patients have yet to be assessed. Treatment with SGN-40 was generally well tolerated. Grade 3/4 events that occurred in more than 1 patient in the intent-to-treat population (N=46), regardless of drug attribution were thrombocytopenia (n=5); neutropenia (n=4); and anemia, fatigue, pneumonia, hyponatremia, DVT, and disease progression (n=2 pts each). Of these events, only fatigue (n=2) and neutropenia (n=2) were considered drug related by the investigator. CONCLUSION: Monotherapy with SGN-40 in DLBCL patients is well tolerated and resulted in objective responses consistent with the previous phase 1 experience. These data support further evaluation of SGN-40 in combination with chemotherapy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma; 3 combination clinical trials are ongoing. Retrospective correlation of clinical outcome and a gene signature that includes baseline CD40 activation status are planned."
