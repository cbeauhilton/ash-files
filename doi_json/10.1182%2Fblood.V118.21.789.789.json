    "abstract_text": "Abstract 789 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a disorder of ineffective hematopoiesis presumed to originate from self-renewing clonal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Previous work has shown that immunophenotypic HSC from MDS patients harbor characteristic clonal cytogenetic abnormalities such as del(5q) at high levels, strongly suggesting that the HSC is the MDS-initiating cell (Tehranchi R., et al., NEJM, 363:11;1025-37, 2010); however, these studies did not examine other cytogenetic subtypes of MDS, nor did they functionally evaluate the HSC from these patients for their ability to initiate disease. We began a molecular and functional evaluation of FACS-purified HSC (Lin-CD34+CD38\u2212CD90+CD45RA-) from MDS patients. These studies showed that the frequency of HSC in MDS bone marrow is not expanded when compared to normal, age-matched control samples. Annexin V staining also demonstrated no difference in apoptosis levels in MDS HSC compared to normal HSC; however, MDS committed myeloid progenitors (Lin-CD34+CD38+) exhibited increased apoptosis compared with normal progenitors (18% vs 39%, respectively, p 12 weeks) was achieved with 50% of MDS samples tested (4/8), and resulted predominantly in myeloid engraftment with 0.8\u20135% total hCD45+ chimerism in the bone marrow. For each MDS HSC engrafted mouse, engraftment of the MDS clone was verified by FISH by detecting previously characterized cytogenetic abnormalities in FACS-sorted hCD45+ cells. The frequency of FISH positive cells was similar to that seen in the primary samples, suggesting no competitive disadvantage of MDS HSC in the xenotransplantation assay. Interestingly, methylcellulose colony and clonal liquid culture assays initiated from FACS-purified MDS HSC consistently grew poorly, suggesting that in vitro assays of hematopoietic potential may not accurately reflect MDS HSC biology. Together, these studies indicate that while MDS HSC are molecularly and functionally different from normal HSC, they are capable of engrafting immunodeficient NSG pups. Moreover, these data formally demonstrate that the HSC is the disease-initiating cell in MDS. This finding has significant implications for MDS research, as it provides a potential in vivo preclinical model for testing MDS therapeutics \u2013 an experimental model previously not available to investigators.
