    "abstract_text": "Myelofibrosis (MF) is the most aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) with the highest degree of morbidity and mortality, including progressive bone marrow fibrosis resulting into bone marrow failure. JAK2 kinase inhibitors have been successfully used for a few years in MPN and more particularly for MF treatment. Despite their beneficial effects on spleen size and symptoms, JAK2 inhibitors induce low molecular and survival responses underscoring the urgent need for other therapeutic approaches. Recently, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) - known to stabilize JAK2 - has been reported as a promising therapeutic target in MPN. However HSP90 inhibitors show toxicity and induce the expression of stress-inducible proteins like HSP70 and, most likely HSP27 as previously shown in other cancers. In addition, we and others have shown that HSP27, was strongly expressed in patients with idiopathic pulmonary, lung or kidney tubulointerstitial fibrosis, underlying a relevant role of HSP27 in fibrotic processes. Taking into account both the beneficial effects of HSP inhibitors in leukemia and in MPN, and the possible implication of HSP27 in fibrosis, we have evaluated in this work, the status of HSP27 in MF patient's samples and assess the effectiveness of an HSP27 oligonucleotide inhibitor called OGX-427. In this study, we first assessed the extracellular and intracellular level of HSPs from MF patients by ELISA, flow cytometry and by immunohistochemistry. We observed for the first time a specific increase in both intracellular and extracellular HSP27 in CD34 + circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells (n=9-16; P =0.0097) and in the sera of patients (n=24-27; P <0.0001) with MF compared with healthy donors, respectively. Moreover, we identified the presence of HSP27 in the bone marrow's MF patients. We then investigated the in vivo impact of OGX-427, a specific inhibitor of HSP27, or an oligonucleotide control in a murine TPO-induced MF mouse model. The use of OGX-427 limited the progression of the disease in our MF mouse model (n=9). In particular, OGX-427 was associated with a marked reduction in both the spleen weight and size. Also, we noted a decrease of megakaryocyte hyperplasia in the bone marrow accompanied by a visible restoration of spleen structure and lymphoid white pulp territories with OGX-427. Taking altogether, our results support a key role of HSP27 in the pathophysiology in MF and highlight the potential therapeutic benefit of HSP27 inhibitors in this disorder.
