    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4271 The achievement of Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) (Ph+ cells 0%) with Imatinib treatment still remains the most important objective in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) patients. According to The European Leukemia NET guidelines, CCyR should be achieved within the 12 th month of treatment while at 3 months of treatment the goal should be complete haematological response. To address the prognostic role of the early achievement of CCyR, we revised 108 chronic phase CML patients [M/F 57/51, median age 54.9 years, interquartile range (IR) 40.8 \u2013 68.1] treated with front-line Imatinib at our Institution from June 2002 to June 2008 who had evaluable karyotype after 3 months of treatment. At onset, median WBC and PLT counts were 78.4 \u00d7 10 9 /l (IR 34.0 \u2013 135.9) and 399 \u00d7 10 9 /l (IR 282 \u2013 585), respectively. Sokal risk score was low in 52 patients (48.1%), intermediate in 49 (45.4%) and high in 7 (6.5%); a short pre-treatment phase (< 3 months) with Hydroxyurea was administered to 94/108 patients (87%). After 3 months of Imatinib treatment, 84 patients (77.7%) achieved CCyR while 24 patients (22.3%) still presented Ph+ metaphases (median value 40%, IR 20 - 80) at cytogenetic analysis. At univariate analysis, factors with a negative prognostic impact on achievement of CCyR at 3 months were palpable spleen enlargement (p=0.002), WBC count at onset > 100.0 \u00d7 10 9 /l (p=0.01) and pre-treatment with Hydroxyurea (p=0.032); on the contrary, sex, age, Sokal risk score and PLT value did not appear to affect early CCyR achievement. Among the 84 patients in CCyR after 3 months, there were 10 failures during follow-up (6 cytogenetic relapses, 2 molecular relapses and 2 evolution to blastic phase); among the 24 patients who did not achieve early CCyR, there were 12 failures during follow-up (9 primary resistances and 3 cytogenetic relapses). The difference in the incidence of failures during follow-up in the 2 groups was highly significant (p<0.001). In conclusion, the achievement of CCyR at 3 months seems unrelated to traditional prognostic factors (Sokal); furthermore, in our experience it appears to have an important prognostic role, as patients not achieving it showed a significantly higher rate of failures during the follow-up.
