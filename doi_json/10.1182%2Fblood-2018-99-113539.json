    "abstract_text": "The HbF to HbA developmental globin switch is recapitulated during adult erythroid differentiation and involves the acquisition of repressive epigenetic marks at the \u03b3-globin promoter catalyzed by \"druggable\" enzymes such as histone deacetylases (HDACs), DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1), LSD1 (KDM1A), and G9A (EHMT2) that are functional components of multiprotein co-repressors recruited to the \u03b3-globin gene promoter by the trans-acting repressors TR2/TR4, BCL11A, and ZBTB7A. A logical approach to increase HbF that has been successfully pursued by our laboratory is to intervene with the epigenetic repression mechanism that executes the switch from HbF to HbA using pharmacological inhibitors of these enzymes. Simian primates such as the baboon are widely acknowledged as the best animal models for testing the ability of new drugs to increase \u03b3-globin expression because results in baboons are predictive of effects in man due to conservation of the structure and developmental stage-specific regulation of the \u03b2-like globin genes in simian primates.Our laboratory has developed and utilized an in vivo baboon model for over thirty years to investigate globin gene regulation and the ability of pharmacological inhibitors of enzymes that catalyze repressive epigenetic modifications to increase HbF, generating results with DNMT inhibitors that were extended and confirmed in a number of clinical studies in patients with SCD and \u03b2-thalassemia. Following studies that identified LSD1 as an additional therapeutic target (Shi et al, Nat Med 19:291, 2013), we showed that the LSD1 inhibitor RN-1 dramatically increased HbF, F cells and F retics in baboons (Rivers et al, Haematol 101:698, 2015) and that these effects were sustained upon long-term treatment (>265d; Ibanez et al, Blood 129:260, 2017). ChIP analysis showed increased levels of Histone H3 di and tri-methyl K4 at the \u03b3-globin gene, consistent with LSD1 inhibition. This current investigation seeks to identify the stage in the erythroid differentiation pathway targeted by LSD1 inhibitors to increase HbF and also to characterize additional effects of these drugs on erythroid differentiation that potentially impact mechanism of action. Subpopulations of bone marrow (BM) cells highly enriched in BFUe (CD105+CD34+CD117+bRBC-), CFUe (CD105+CD34+CD117+bRBC+), proerythroblasts (CD105+CD34-CD117+bRBC+) were purified from RN-1 treated (0.25mg/kg/d; 3d) and untreated baboons by immunomagnetic column separation combined with FACS. RT-PCR analysis of \u03b3-globin expression within purified BM erythroid subpopulations showed that relative levels of \u03b3-globin mRNA (\u03b3/\u03b3+\u03b2) in untreated baboons were 4 fold higher in BFUe than in CFUe and 11 fold higher in BFUe than in proerythroblasts consistent with repression of the \u03b3-globin gene during the BFUe to CFUe transition. RN-1 treatment increased relative \u03b3-globin expression (\u03b3/\u03b3+\u03b2) 4 fold in BFUe, 25 fold in CFUe, and >100 fold in proerythroblasts compared to untreated controls and thus partially prevented repression of the \u03b3-globin expression at early stages of differentiation. Additional effects of the LSD1 inhibitor RN-1 on erythroid differentiation were measured by flow cytometry in baboon BM aspirates following RN-1 administration. RN-1 treatment (0.25mg/kg/d; 3d) increased the proportion of CD105+CD117+bRBC+BM cells (proerythroblasts) (24.2% pre-treatment; 48.4% post-treatment; p265d) identified a common set of 41 genes whose expression was increased while the expression of 6 genes was decreased. RT-PCR assays confirmed increased expression of \u03b3-globin, GATA-2, GFi-1B, DAP, IFI6, and Lyn in proerythroblasts of RN-1-treated baboons. We conclude that the LSD1 inhibitor RN-1 administered to baboons 1) restrains erythroid differentiation by modulating the expression of genes such as GATA-1 and GFi-1B that regulate erythroid differentiation, and 2) targets an early event responsible for \u03b3-globin repression to increase \u03b3-globin expression.
