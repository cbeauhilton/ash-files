    "abstract_text": "Rationale: In a previous randomized trial (AML HD98B) in elderly (>60 yrs) patients with AML (excluding APL), we could demonstrate that all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) given as adjunct to intensive induction therapy with idarubicin, cytarabine and etoposide significantly improved outcome; this beneficial effect appeared to be restricted to patients having NPM1 mutation without concomitant FLT3 -ITD ( NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD neg ). In our subsequent trial in elderly patients (AMLSG 06-04), all patients received ATRA with a similar backbone of chemotherapy, except that for induction therapy idarubicin was intensified and etoposide was omitted. NPM1 mut AML is associated with myelomonocytic/monocytic differentiation, and etoposide is believed to have a particular effect in these morphologic subtypes of AML. Aims: To evaluate the impact of etoposide in combination with ATRA in elderly patients with AML exhibiting NPM1 mutation enrolled into two consecutive AMLSG protocols. Methods: 171 patients with NPM1 mut AML were included in this retrospective analysis; 78 patients from trial AML HD98B (trial A; accrual from 1998 to 2004); and 95 patients from trial AMLSG 06-04 (trial B, 2004\u20132008). Twenty-nine of 78 (37%) patients and 87 of 93 (94%) received ATRA in trials A and B, respectively. Results: Initial patient characteristics, such as median age (67.8 and 67.9 years for trial A and B, respectively), type of AML ( de novo , secondary or therapy-associated), white blood cell count (WBC), LDH, and FLT3 -ITD mutation status (41% and 47%), were not significantly different between the two cohorts. The rates of complete remission (CR) were 68% and 71% for NPM1 mut patients in trial A and B, respectively. Lower age and lower WBC counts were significantly associated with achievement of CR; study, treatment with ATRA, type of AML, and FLT3 -ITD mutation status had no impact. Univariable survival analyses revealed no significant difference for the end points event-free (EFS), relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between the two patient cohorts from trial A and B. However, when restricting the analysis to patients who had received ATRA, a significant better EFS (p=0.05) and RFS (p=0.03) was found for patients with the genotype NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD neg in trial A (that included etoposide) compared to trial B (in which etoposide was omitted); there was no difference in EFS (p=0.18) and RFS (p=0.09) for patients with the genotype NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD pos . In addition, no difference was seen either in patients with the genotype NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD pos or in patients with the genotype NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD neg in terms of OS mainly due to a high second CR rate in patients with the genotype NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD neg . Conclusion: The data from this retrospective subgroup analysis suggest that etoposide in combination with ATRA may exert a beneficial synergistic effect in elderly patients with AML having NPM1 mutation without concurrent FLT3 -ITD."
