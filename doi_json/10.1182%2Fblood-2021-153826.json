    "abstract_text": "Background: The oral Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax (Ven) has preclinical activity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and has shown encouraging response rates in combination with the Bcl-xL inhibitor navitoclax in patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (R/R) ALL. We hypothesized that the addition of Ven to low-intensity chemotherapy with mini-hyper-CVD may improve outcomes in pts with ALL. Methods: Pts \u226560 years of age with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative B- or T-cell ALL/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) or \u226518 years of age with R/R Ph-negative B- or T-cell ALL/LBL were eligible. Pts were required to have a PS of \u22643, total bilirubin \u22641.5 mg/dl, AST/ALT \u22643 x ULN and creatinine \u22642 mg/dl. Pts received mini-hyper-CVD alternating with methotrexate and cytarabine (cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone at 50% dose reduction, no anthracycline, methotrexate at 75% dose reduction, cytarabine at 0.5 g/m 2 x 4 doses) for up to 8 cycles. Ven was given at a dose of 400 mg daily on days 1-14 of cycle 1 and on days 1-7 of cycles 2-8. Rituximab (if CD20+ B-cell ALL) and prophylactic IT chemotherapy x 8 doses were given for the first 4 cycles. Pts with T-cell ALL received an additional 2 cycles of nelarabine (650 mg/m 2 daily on days 1-5) and peg-asparaginase (1,500 IU/m 2 [capped at 3750 IU] on day 5), without Ven, during consolidation and another 2 cycles of nelarabine plus peg-asparaginase during maintenance. Responding pts received vincristine and prednisone maintenance with venetoclax daily on days 1-14 of each 28-day cycle for up to 2 years. Results: Between 6/2019 and 12/2020, 23 pts have been treated (4 frontline and 19 R/R). Pt characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . The median age in the frontline cohort was 63 yrs (range, 26-64) and in the R/R cohort was 45 (range, 21-70). In the frontline cohort 1 pt had B-ALL, 2 pts had T-cell ALL and 1 pt had T-cell LBL. In the R/R cohort, 14 had B-cell ALL, 4 had T-cell ALL, and 1 had T-cell LBL, including 2 pts with ETP ALL. Among the 19 R/R pts, the median number of prior therapies was 1 (range, 1-5) and 10 (53%) had undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT). Among the 14 R/R B-cell pts, 12 (86%) had received prior blinatumomab and 5 (36%) had received prior inotuzumab ozogamicin. Among the 4 frontline pts, 3 (75%) achieved CR. The 4 th pt achieved brief PR as best response. All responders achieved their best response after cycle 1. One pt achieved MRD negativity after cycle 1, and all 3 responders achieved MRD negativity at some point during therapy. Among the 19 R/R pts, 2 were in CR at enrollment and 17 were evaluable for morphologic response. 11 pts (65%) responded to the regimen (CR, n=8; CRp, n=2; CRi, n=1). An additional pt achieved PR. Among the 11 responders, 8 achieved best response after 1 cycle and 3 after cycle 2. 2 pts achieved MRD negativity after cycle 1, and 3 pts achieved MRD negativity at some point during therapy. Responses were similar among pts with B-cell ALL (64%) and T-cell ALL/LBL (66%) and among pts with adverse-risk karyotype (40%) and non-adverse risk karyotype (60%) [P=0.46]. The median duration of follow-up is 12.2 months (range, 2-18 months). Among the 3 frontline pts who achieved remission, 1 underwent alloSCT and is still in remission and the other 2 remain on therapy in remission. Among the 13 R/R pts who achieved remission, 6 (55%) relapsed, 4 (31%) underwent alloSCT (2 are still alive without relapse and 2 subsequently relapsed), 2 (18%) died in remission, and 1 (9%) is in remission without alloSCT or relapse. In the R/R cohort, the median PFS and OS were 6.2 and 7.1 months, respectively, and the estimated 1-year PFS and OS rates were 14% and 30%, respectively (Figure 1) . Outcomes were inferior for those with adverse-risk karyotype versus others (median OS 6.0 vs 10.7 months; 1-yr OS rate: 17% vs 45%; P=0.04). Treatment was overall well-tolerated. In cycle 1, the median time to platelet recovery was 27 days (range, 0-81 days) and neutrophil recovery was 20 days (range, 0-36); in cycle, median times to recovery were 26 days (range, 17-41) and 19 days (range, 0-26), respectively. In the entire cohort, the 30-day and 60-day mortality rates were 0% and 4%, respectively. One pt in the R/R cohort died from refractory disease and sepsis on day 43. Conclusion: Low-intensity chemotherapy with hyper-CVD plus venetoclax was safe and effective in pts with Ph-negative ALL. Continued evaluation of venetoclax-based regimens in ALL, including in the frontline setting, are warranted.
