    "abstract_text": "Background Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common hematologic malignancies affecting both children and adults. Targeted therapy represents a promising approach in AML with the potential for increased efficacy and reduced toxicity. However, the molecular abnormalities in AML are extraordinarily heterogeneous. Numerous genetic changes are reported which require careful functional analyses to distinguish \u201cdriver mutations\u201d from \u201cpassengers.\u201d Because cytokine/growth factor receptors contribute to cancer pathogenesis by regulating growth, differentiation, senescence and survival, we designed a functional screen focusing on these molecules. This RNAi-based screen was designed to reveal the functional and prognostic relevance of cytokine/growth factor receptors in leukemia. Using this approach, we identified several interleukin receptors that play critical roles in promoting leukemia cell growth. Importantly, we show the novel roles of two interleukin receptors, IL2R\u03b3 and IL1R1, in promoting AML cell growth. Methods and Results We designed an siRNA-based functional screen targeting 188 growth factor receptors that were found highly expressed in mononuclear cells of 140 primary leukemia samples by gene expression microarray analysis. We tested 72 leukemia patient samples with AML, ALL and MPN and 10 cell lines for dependence on these receptors. Cells were electroporated with siRNAs and cell viability was quantified after 72 hrs. Novel candidate targets found in AML patient samples include IL17R, IL9R, IL4R IL1R1, IL2R\u03b3, IL2R\u03b1 and IL15R\u03b1. We found a variety of genetic abnormalities in these target genes, including splice variation (IL2R\u03b1) and intron retention (IL15R\u03b1). We found that IL2R\u03b3 is a potential target in a JAK3 A572V mutation positive AML cell line (CMK). Validation experiments demonstrated that knockdown of IL2R\u03b3 significantly reduces the viability of CMK cells (90% decrease) and abrogates phosphorylation of JAK3 and downstream signaling molecules, JAK1, STAT5, MAPK and pS6 ribosomal protein. Intriguingly, the absence of IL2R\u03b3 in murine bone marrow completely abrogated the clonogenic potential of JAK3 A572V as compared to IL2R\u03b3 wild-type marrow. These effects were rescued by co-expressing IL2R\u03b3 with JAK3 A572V but not by co-expressing IL2R\u03b3 with JAK3 Y100C , an inactivating mutation. Additionally, we found that IL2R\u03b3 contributes to constitutive JAK3 mutant signaling by increasing JAK3 protein levels and phosphorylation. Conversely, mutant but not wild type JAK3 increased the expression of IL2R\u03b3, indicating IL2R\u03b3 contributes to constitutive JAK3 signaling through a feedback mechanism. Similarly, IL2R\u03b3 receptor is critical for transforming potential of additional JAK3 activating mutations such as JAK3 M511I and JAK3 A573V . Overall these results demonstrate an oncogenic potentiating role of IL2R\u03b3. Additionally, we found that silencing IL1R1 reduces the viability of 25% of AML primary samples. Most IL1R1 knockdown-sensitive AML samples exhibit monocytic and myelomonocytic features; however, no correlation with particular somatic mutations has thus far been observed. Confirming the importance of IL1R1 using a genetic model, we found that the absence of IL1R1 in murine bone marrow leads to the significant ablation of clonogenic potential (80% reduction) induced with AML1-ETO9a, NRAS G12D and MLL-ENL oncogenes as compared to wild-type marrow in a ligand-dependent manner. Similarly knocking down IL1R1 in CD34+ AML cells reduces cell growth and phosphorylation of p38. Conversely, the presence of exogenous IL1 promotes AML cell survival by increasing p38 phosphorylation, which is significantly inhibited with p38 inhibitors such as Doramapimod. These results support a novel role for IL1R1-mediated signaling in promoting AML cell growth and targeting of this pathway in AML. Conclusions RNAi-based functional screening for leukemia cell dependence on cytokine/growth factor receptors led to the identification of novel oncogenic pathophysiological mechanisms. Specifically, (A) IL2R\u03b3 is essential for the growth of leukemia cells harboring activating JAK3 mutations and (B) IL1R1 is involved in regulating growth and survival of AML cells, particularly with monocytic differentiation. These findings underscore the importance of interleukin receptors in leukemia pathogenesis and suggest that targeting these pathways in AML will be beneficial.
