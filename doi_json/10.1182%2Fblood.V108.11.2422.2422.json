    "abstract_text": "Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is an indolent B cell malignancy whose diagnosis is based on lymphocyte morphology, immunophenotype and marrow and/or splenic histology. Unlike other lymphomas, there is not a common chromosomal translocation specific for SMZL, and genetic prognostic factors are poorly defined. To investigate the pattern of genomic aberrations in SMZL, we applied comparative genomic hybridization to BAC microarrays (array CGH) to a well characterized series of 75 SMZL specimens. We applied two different 1 Mb-resolution BAC arrays: UCSF HumArray 3.2 and a novel array CGH platform developed at Univ. of Salamanca. These arrays allowed us to detect DNA copy number changes across the genome with high accuracy in 67 of 75 patient samples. Data were compared with our previous array CGH studies of 170 samples from different B-cell lymphoma subgroups. FISH studies for IGH, IGK and IGL translocations and 7q deletion were performed on tissue microarrays in 24 cases. Of the 67 samples, 19 (28%) showed a normal genomic profile. The median number of genomic aberrations per tumor was 2.2 (1.3 gains and 0.9 losses), which was lower than the rates detected in other lymphoma subgroups (diffuse large cell lymphoma, 6.4; mantle cell lymphoma, 6; follicular lymphoma, 4.5) and comparable to MALT lymphomas (2 abnormalities per tumor). SMZL cells showed a genomic pattern characterized by gain of chromosomes 3q24-q29 (18%), 6p (9%), 12q (9%), and 18q (4%) and loss of 7q32 (34%), 8p21-p23 (13%), 17p13 (10%) at P53 locus and 6q21-q27 (9%). Notably, no alterations of the P16/ARF (9p21) or MYC loci (8q24) were detected. Correlation of array CGH data with conventional cytogenetics, FISH and LOH studies revealed a high concordance. Detailed mapping of 7q deletions delineated a consensus region of loss of 3 Mb in 7q32. This 7q deletion was almost exclusive to SMZL, being observed in only 5 of 170 non-SMZL B-cell lymphomas (p=0.0000001). Four cases presented IG-translocation. Mutation of IGH was observed in 62% and correlated with a complex karyotype (61 vs. 13%; p=0,0008) whereas unmutated IGH correlated with the deletion of 7q (56 vs. 23%; p=0,01). Among the various genomic abnormalities, only the deletion of 8p or the presence of a complex karyotype correlated with inferior overall survival (OS) (median OS, 58 vs. 110 months, p=0,004; and 60 vs. 105 months, p=0,01; respectively). In summary, array CGH has defined a pattern of genomic aberrations in SMZL that differs from other B-cell lymphoma subgroups and that may predict overall survival. Because the deletion of 7q32 is the most distinctive genetic marker in SMZL, the identification of a putative tumor suppressor gene inactivated within the region of deletion seems mandatory.",
