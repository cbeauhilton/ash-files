    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2998 Background: Multiple myeloma remains incurable with current therapies and novel approaches based on disease biology are needed. Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) proteins represent a conserved group of proteins that are important regulators of apoptosis. X-linked IAP (XIAP) is the best studied IAP and inhibits pro-apoptotic caspases 3, 7 and 9. Multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines express high levels of XIAP and levels are further increased when stimulated by cytokines IL6 and IGF-1, both secreted in copious amounts in the myeloma microenvironment. IL6 and IGF1 up-regulate XIAP by activating the NF-\u03baB, MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways that are commonly aberrant in MM and other tumors. XIAP mRNA contains an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) sequence in the 5` untranslated region. IRES sequences enable direct ribosome recruitment and aid in translation that is independent of cap-mediated translation. Thus, molecules like mTOR inhibitors might not lead to XIAP downregulation. This was observed when rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, was used on MM cell lines. XIAP protein levels were not reduced due to the IRES sequence which leads to translation that is independent of the 5` cap and 4EBP1. Thus XIAP inhibitors might be able to overcome resistance associated with rapamycin treatment. Methods: LC161 was synthesized by Novartis Inc. (Basel, Switzerland). Stock solutions were made in DMSO, and subsequently diluted in RPMI-1640 medium for use. MM cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (20% serum for primary patient cells) supplemented with L-Glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cytotoxicity was measured using the MTT viability assay and proliferation using thymidine uptake. Apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry upon cell staining with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI). Immunoblotting was done on cell extracts at various time points following incubation with the drug in order to study the cell signaling pathways. Results: LC161 treatment resulted in a dose and time dependent inhibition of cell growth in the MM cell lines tested. Most of the cytotoxicity was evident by 72 hours, with minimal increase seen up to 96 hours of incubation. At 72 hours of incubation, the median inhibitory concentration varied considerably between various cell lines with an IC50 range of 2.5\u201325\u03bc M. The IC 50 s were maintained when the cells were treated in co-culture with stromal cells or in the presence of IL6, IGF or VEGF. Dose-dependent decrease in proliferation of the cell lines was evidenced by decreased thymidine incorporation. Apoptotic changes in cells following drug treatment was confirmed by flow cytometry for Annexin and PI. Cleavage of caspases 3, 8 and 9 were confirmed on flow cytometry. Primary myeloma cells from patients were treated with increasing doses of the drug and dose dependent increase in apoptosis was observed. Immunoblotting studies demonstrated dose dependent significant down regulation of Xiap, cIAP1, cIAP2 and surviving and up-regulation of activated caspases 3, 8 and 9 and PARP. Furthermore, LC161 resulted in down regulation of pAkt, canonical and non-canonical NF-\u03baB, pJNK, p-p38MAPK, c-Myc, Bcl-xL and Mcl1 and up-regulation of pErk and Bcl-2. We are currently examining basal levels of expression of the IAP proteins (Xiap, cIAP1 and cIAP2), pAkt and pErk in various MM cell lines to identify marker proteins that might predict response to this class of drug. In addition, our initial studies of LC161 in combination with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib demonstrated synergy in killing MM cells in vitro. Additional combinations including inhibitors of the Akt/mTOR pathway and MEK/Erk pathway are currently been done. Conclusion: These studies demonstrate significant in vitro activity of LC161 in MM. Our results suggest the presence of two populations one very sensitive to IAP inhibition and one relatively less sensitive. Our current studies will help identify marker proteins that might predict response to LC161 treatment. We are currently testing LC261 in combination with known inhibitors of the other important signaling pathways implicated in MM disease biology as well as in-vivo experiments in mouse models. Performing these experiments will further validate the efficacy of LC161 as an anti-MM agent and form the basis for it to be taken up for clinical evaluation either as a single agent or in combination with other agent(s).
