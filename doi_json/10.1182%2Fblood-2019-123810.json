    "abstract_text": "Background: The Antibody-Coupled T-cell Receptor (ACTR) platform is an autologous engineered T-cell therapy that combines the cell-killing ability of T cells and the tumor-targeting ability of co-administered antibodies to exert potent antitumor immune responses. ACTR087 comprises the extracellular domain of CD16 linked to a CD3\u03b6-signaling domain and a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain. Here we present the clinical experience from Study ATTCK-20-2 (NCT02776813), a multicenter, phase 1 study of ACTR087 in combination with rituximab in subjects with relapsed or refractory (R/R) CD20 + NHL. Methods: The main objectives of this first-in-human study were to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of ACTR087+rituximab. Other objectives included evaluating ACTR T-cell persistence and other correlative biomarkers. Subjects must have had CD20 + NHL that was R/R after prior treatments, which must have included anti-CD20 antibody-containing chemotherapy. Subjects received lymphodepleting chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) for 3 days, followed by rituximab and a single dose of ACTR087. Additional doses of rituximab were administered q3w until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or Investigator decision. The study included a dose escalation phase (increasing doses of ACTR087) and an expansion phase (ACTR087 at the preliminary recommended phase 2 dose [RP2D]); all subjects received rituximab at a fixed dose of 375 mg/m 2 q3w. Results: Two dose levels (DL) of ACTR087 were evaluated during dose escalation (n=17). The MTD was exceeded at DL2, with severe cases of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Statistical analysis of the relationship between non-hematologic toxicity and ACTR + T-cell doses was retrospectively performed (two-parameter Bayesian logistic regression model) to estimate an RP2D of 35\u00d710 6 ACTR + T cells. Nine subjects enrolled in an expansion cohort and received ACTR087 at this RP2D in combination with rituximab. Among all subjects treated (n=26), the majority (69%) were diagnosed with DLBCL. Subjects had received a median of 3 (range 1-9) prior lines of therapy, with 77% having received \u22653 prior lines. ACTR087 showed dose-dependent expansion with peak levels generally observed 7 to 14 days post administration. In subjects with ongoing clinical response (CR), ACTR remained detectable through the last timepoint evaluated. Across all cohorts, Grade \u22653 TEAEs reported in >3 subjects regardless of causality were limited to hematologic events. Potential T cell-mediated toxicities were observed, including 4 serious cases of CRS (Gr 4 in 2 subjects, both with fatal sepsis) and 2 serious cases of neurotoxicity (1 Gr 5, 1 Gr 4 in a subject with fatal septic shock). Elevated baseline inflammatory markers (eg, ferritin, CRP) were observed in patients who developed Gr \u22653 CRS and neurotoxicity post ACTR087. Of note, severe CRS presented without fever and events occurred >7 days post ACTR087. Clinical activity was reported with an ORR of 50% in all dose levels tested, including durable complete responses, with one subject in CR for 869+ days ( Table 1 ). Conclusions: ACTR087+rituximab demonstrated antitumor activity, with observed safety events that are expected with other autologous T-cell products. The time to onset and clinical presentation of severe CRS and neurotoxicity events in this study informed the safety monitoring and adverse reaction management guidance across clinical studies of ACTR T-cell products. Data from this first-in-human study of ACTR087+rituximab confirm the proof of concept and will be used to guide further development for the ACTR platform. Updated clinical data, as well as expanded biomarker correlations to efficacy and safety, will be presented.
