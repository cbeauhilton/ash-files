Methods: Retrospective study covering more than 20 years after a first venous thromboembolic event in a group of 1,440 patients with VTE. Results: In the subgroup of patients (n=515) with a first spontaneous VTE, the yearly incidence of a recurrent spontaneous VTE was 8% for the time period 0-2 years and 4-6% in the following 8 years, after a first VTE, triggered by a transient risk factor (oral contraceptives, surgery or immobilization, pregnancy), the yearly incidence of a recurrent spontaneous VTE was 2% (first 2 years) and 1.3-3% (following 8 years). The hazard ratio for recurrent spontaneous VTE in patients with a first spontaneous VTE for specific predictors were as follows: prothrombin mutation heterozygous 1.2 (95% CI 0.9-1.7), FVL heterozygous 1.3 (95% CI 0.92-1.8), male sex 1.9 (95% CI 1.4-2.7), D-Dimer 2.3 (0.9-6.4), protein C (<60% activity) 2.6 (95% CI 1.2-5.7), FVL homozygous 3.0 (1.3-7.7), AT (<60% activity) 3.0 (95% CI 0.96-9.6). In Conclusion , in patients with a first spontaneous VTE the yearly recurrence rate of 5% is more than doubled in the presence of relevant thrombophilic risk factors supporting the need of long-term oral anticoagulant therapy after a first idiopathic VTE. In contrast to current ACCP recommendations, thrombophilic risk factors are of clinical relevance. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
