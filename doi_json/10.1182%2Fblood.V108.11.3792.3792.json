    "abstract_text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are capable of decreasing cardiac remodelling in patients with cardiac dysfunction, however their effects on sickle cell disease (SCD) are unknown. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the cardiac effects of enalapril on SCD patients. Thirteen adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and microalbuminuria (3M/10F); 11 sickle cell anemia patients (SCA), 1 S\u03b2 thalassemia patient (S\u03b2) and 1 patient with hemoglobin SC (SC) were treated with enalapril. Thirteen other SCD patients (4M/9F) without microalbuminuria, matched according to age, diagnosis (11 SCA, 1 S\u03b2 and 1 SC), and levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit and fetal hemoglobin, did not receive enalapril and were followed up as the control group in the same period of study. In the treated group, enalapril (5mg) was administered to 9 SCD patients during the entire study period. One patient did not complete follow-up, and higher doses (7.5mg to 20mg) were administered to 3 patients who developed systolic BP over 120 mmHg during the study period. Median age (28.5 vs 29.0; P= 0.580), baseline values of hemoglobin (8.5 vs 8.4g/dL, P= 0.600), hematocrit (25.0 vs 23.5%, P= 0.500), fetal hemoglobin (4.4 vs 4.1%, P=0.720) and mean blood pressure (MBP; 80 vs 93mmHg, P= 0.13) were similar in treated and untreated patients Echocardiograms were performed before the study entry and once a year in patients and controls. Comparisons of groups were performed at the beginning of the study and after 36 months of follow-up using the Wilcoxon-signed rank test and Spearman coefficient. At 36 months of follow-up, MBP was lower than the baseline value (93 mmHg vs 87 mmHg, P= 0.018) in the treated group. Significant increases in left ventricular mass (192 vs 231g, P= 0.005), posterior left ventricular wall thickness in end-diastole (8.5 vs 10.0mm, P= 0.013), left ventricular mass index (114.4 vs 131g/m2, P= 0.043), interventricular septal wall thickness in end-diastole (9.0 vs 9.5mm, P= 0.036) and aortic root dimension (28 vs 32mm, P= 0.009) values were seen in untreated, but not in enalapril treated patients. No major changes were seen in left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular systolic diameter, left ventricular diastolic dimension and left atrial diameter, in both groups, along the observational period. No significant correlation was detected between the data here presented. At the end of the study, no symptoms or signals related to cardiac failure were found in any of the enrolled patients. These results indicate a trend toward cardiac and aortic root remodeling in untreated SCD patients and suggest that long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors has beneficial effects on the cardiac remodeling of SCD patients and could be indicated for adult patients, if an increase in baseline blood pressure occurs.",
