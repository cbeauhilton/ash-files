    "abstract_text": "Red blood cell disorders like Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and \u03b2-thalassemias are caused by alterations within the gene for the hemoglobin \u03b2 (HB\u03b2) subunit. An anti-sickling fetal ortholog of HB\u03b2, hemoglobin \u03b3 (HB\u03b3) can reverse disease-related pathophysiology in these disorders by also forming complexes with the required hemoglobin \u03b1 subunit. Because \u03b2-like globin expression is developmentally regulated, with a reduction in the fetal ortholog (\u03b3) occurring shortly after birth concomitantly with an increase in the adult ortholog (\u03b2), it has been postulated that maintaining expression of the anti-sickling \u03b3 ortholog may be of therapeutic benefit. Previously, inhibitors of a chromatin modifying enzyme G9a/GLP (G9a-i) have been shown to upregulate \u03b3 expression relative to \u03b2 expression and therefore G9a/GLP has been proposed as a reasonable molecular target for maintenance of the anti-sickling \u03b3 ortholog. However, we have found that the reactivation of \u03b3 occurs in a narrow concentration range of G9a-i with higher concentrations reducing the levels of \u03b3. Moreover, the enhanced \u03b3 / \u03b2 expression ratio occurs simultaneously with a reduction in expression of the critical hemoglobin \u03b1 subunit. We therefore set out to identify novel modulators and targets of HB\u03b3 expression. We have demonstrated that targeting different components of the globin regulatory network can have profoundly different effects on globin expression. Importantly, we are utilizing a newly developed in vitro SCD cellular model to investigate how these globin gene regulators impact SCD pathophysiology.
