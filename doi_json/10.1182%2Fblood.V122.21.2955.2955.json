    "abstract_text": "Background Patients with cancer may face a significant knowledge deficit as they battle their illness. We developed a first of its kind comprehensive patient symposia (Living with Cancer (LWC): A Mayo Clinic Symposia for Patients and Loved Ones) with 8 hours of general sessions (covering nutrition, exercise, cancer inheritance, financial and legal challenges, communication, survivorship, and cancer therapy) and a 4-hour disease specific breakout (myeloid diseases, myeloma, lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, breast cancer, lung cancer, cutaneous malignancy, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer). Through voluntary questionnaires, we studied the impact of this cancer symposium on quality of life, cancer specific knowledge, and symptom management among cancer patients. Methods LWC meeting attendees were provided surveys prior to and 3 months following the convention. Surveys included 1) EORTC-QLQ-C30; 2) new disease understanding tool developed specifically for this conference; 3) distress thermometer and problems checklist; 4) validated disease-specific questionnaires. Changes over time were assessed using McNemar\u2019s tests and paired t-tests for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Results Patients: 158 attendees completed the pre-convention survey. The median age was 67.5 (range 30-86), 49% males, 76% over 1 year from diagnosis. Cancer type included 37% hematologic malignancies, 23% breast cancer, 23% prostate cancer, and 17% other. The hematologic malignancies were comprised of 34% leukemia, 31% CLL/lymphoma, 25% amyloid/multiple myeloma, and 9.3% myeloproliferative neoplasms. Baseline Disease Understanding, Symptoms, QOL: Most attendees endorsed understanding their disease quite a bit (54%) or very much (29%). Most respondents reported at least \u201cquite a bit\u201d of understanding regarding treatment options (84%), screening modalities (83%), symptomatology (74%), and cancer-related side effects (71%). Attendees endorsed the least understanding of disease-related stress (49%), risk factors (49%), management of disease related fatigue (41%), and legal issues related to disease/treatment (27%) Mean QLQ-C30 scores were 84.4 for physical functioning, 83 for role functioning, 80.7 for social functioning, and 72.7 for global health status. The symptoms with highest mean scores were insomnia, fatigue, and pain. Knowledge Improvement Durable at 3 Months: 115 (73%) patients completed the post-symposium survey. There was improvement in 12 of 14 areas of self-reported knowledge ( Table 1 ) especially in areas of nutrition, and management of disease related stress and fatigue (all p<0.001).

Conclusions This first evaluation of a patient centered cancer symposium as an education intervention suggests patients selecting to participate in such an event seek to improve an already solid knowledge base regarding their malignant disease. Participating in the event improved disease specific knowledge in numerous areas. However, as a single intervention, function and symptoms tended not to improve with participation. Future efforts on 1) improving participation with disease knowledge \u201cna\u00efve\u201d patients and 2) targeted efforts aimed at specific symptom management (i.e. insomnia, stress) are planned. This study serves as an avenue to empower patients and inform physicians to improve the experience of living with cancer. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
