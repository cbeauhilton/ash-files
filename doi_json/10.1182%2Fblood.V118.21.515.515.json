    "abstract_text": "Abstract 515 Background: Recent studies indicate that the disease-specific mortality In sickle cell anemia is about 6% in children up to 18 years and 15% in the 18\u201330 year age group, yielding a cumulative mortality of 21% by age 30 years. It is important to identify children at high risk so that early interventions can be developed to reduce this high mortality. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 505 children and adolescents with sickle cell disease in 2005\u20132010, 380 with hemoglobin SS and 130 with other genotypes. The median age at enrollment was 12 years with a range of 3 to 20 years. Baseline clinical features, echocardiography, six-minute walk test and pulmonary function testing were performed at steady-state. Follow-up for mortality has been performed in 470 of the participants at a median of 37 months after enrollment, range of 1 to 59 months. Results: Six of 470 patients (1.3%) died during the follow-up period, five with hemoglobin SS and one with hemoglobin SC. The median age at the time of death in these six participants was 20 years, range of 15 to 23 years. Death occurred during the follow-up period in 2.7% of participants over 12 years of age at enrollment and 3.7% of those over 15 years of age. The causes of death were stroke in 4, multiorgan failure in 1 and unknown in 1. Death occurred in 5.9% of 51 participants with a history of stroke versus 0.7% of 416 without stroke history; in 3.5% of 113 participants with a history of asthma versus 0.6% of 354 without asthma history; in 4.9% of 103 participants with 10 or more blood transfusions lifetime versus 0.3% of 359 with less than 10 blood transfusions; in 3.3% of 90 participants with two or more severe pain episodes in the past year versus 0.8% of 380 participants with less than two severe pain episodes in the past year. In age-adjusted analyses, the hazards ratio (95% CI) of death was 6.1 (1.2-30.5) for history of stroke (P=0.029), 10.2 (1.2-89.5) for history of frequent blood transfusions (P=0.036), 5.8 (1.1-31.8) for history of asthma (P=0.044) and 1.07 (1.00-1.14) for frequent severe pain episodes (P=0.047). Clinical findings associated with these risk factors included higher concentrations of markers of hemolysis for history of stroke and history of frequent blood transfusions, decreased FEV1/FVC and increased total lung capacity for history of asthma, and lower concentrations of markers of hemolysis and high ECHO-determined tricuspid regurgitation velocity for history of frequent severe pain episodes. Conclusions: Over a median of three years of observation of this cohort, no deaths occurred among 248 sickle cell disease children 12 years of age or younger at enrollment but there were 6 deaths among 222 participants 13\u201320 years of age at enrollment. In bi-variate age-adjusted analyses, histories of stroke, asthma, frequent blood transfusions and frequent pain episodes were associated with an increased risk of death. Strikingly, four of the five deaths in which the cause was known were due to stroke. The present data on mortality in the PUSH study suggest that prevention of stroke is critical in improving the survival in adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease.
