    "abstract_text": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) leukemic cells express B-cell receptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG) whose signaling is of paramount importance throughout the natural history of the disease. Indeed, signaling pathways downstream of the BcR are constitutively active in all cases of CLL and inhibitors of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase BTK (Ibrutinib) or PI3K\u03b4 (Idelalisib), two downstream signaling effectors, are clinically effective. This functional evidence complements earlier molecular observations supporting antigen drive in CLL ontogeny, including the distinction of CLL into cases with somatically hypermutated BcR IG (M-CLL) that have a significantly better outcome compared to those with unmutated, germline-like receptors (U-CLL). CLL also displays a remarkably skewed BcR IG gene repertoire, culminating in the existence of highly homologous, stereotyped BcR IG in >30% of cases, indicating selection by a limited set of antigenis. A number of potential antigenic elements have been described, being recognized by the monoclonal receptors and able to deliver intracellular signals. More recently, it has been reported that CLL cells are endowed with the apparently unique property of autonomous signaling, since individual CLL-derived BcR IG can promote Ca 2 + influx and NF-\u03baB target gene transcription in a reconstituted B cell system upon self-recognition of common BcR-intrinsic epitopes. However, the precise molecular details of such process are unknown. In order to gain insight into the molecular interactions, particularly to further understand the role played by autonomous signaling, we determined the crystal structures of two BcR IG of CLL cases assigned to subset #4. This is a CLL subset expressing stereotyped, G(\u03ba)-switched BcR IG encoded by the IGHV4-34/IGKV2-30 gene combination. Subset #4 accounts for ~1% of all CLL and is the largest within M-CLL, distinctive for a particularly indolent clinical course. BcR IG derived from two subset #4 cases were found to bind autologously via their VH CDR3 loops to a composite surface spanning the variable and constant regions of the heavy chain; the relevant epitope is conserved in all cases belonging to subset #4 and differs from other non-subset #4 BcR IG. This specific self-recognition was identified as dependent on the individual IG gene usage in the BcR, and is functionally relevant as it occurs in solution and leads to intracellular signalling in B cells. Analysis of epitope and paratope mutants revealed that the interactions observed in the crystal structures are mediated by a few critical amino acid residues. Indeed, the distinctively conserved amino acid residues in the VH CDR3 loop of the BcR IG both dictate a specific VH-VK pairing and shape the combining site for autologous recognition. Moreover, the epitope comprises specific amino acids from the CH1 domain that restrict the autologous recognition to IgG molecules. Finally, we found persisting long-lived interaction occurring between subset #4 BcR IGs, thus recalling high affinity receptor-cognate antigen interactions associated with the induction of anergy. This scenario well fits with the anergic phenotype of the subset #4 leukemic cells, and thus provides a biochemical explanation for the indolent clinical course of this subset. In conclusion, though focusing on a particular CLL subset, the structural and biochemical analysis here presented describes a general model for autologous recognition that may epitomize the molecular events leading to the expansion of CLL B lymphocytes at large. It is conceivable that CLL-associated BcR IGs can each bind to a distinct internal epitope with the specific nature of the interaction dictated by diverse factors e.g. VDJ recombination, heavy and light chain pairing, SHM, and isotype switch. The strength and persistence of the autologous recognition can then lead to a specific outcome in the intracellular signaling process, ranging from proliferation to anergy. The structural diversity thus produced in the BcR IG development may be linked to and underlie the heterogeneity characterizing CLL at the biological and clinical level.
