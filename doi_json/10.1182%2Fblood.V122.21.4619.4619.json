    "abstract_text": "Introduction Graft versus host disease (GvHD) is the main cause of morbimortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in in the promoter region of cytokine genes have shown to alter their expression and are therefore associated with donor-recipient alloreactivity and, ultimately, with SCT outcome. Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is secreted by CD4+ T-cells and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases but its importance in SCT is not well-known. Objective To analyse the influence of IL-17A SNP genotypes on the risk and severity of GvHD and other complications after HLA-identical allo-SCT. Patients and Methods Genomic DNA obtained from peripheral blood samples belonging to 546 patients and their HLA-identical sibling donors (Table 1) included in the DNA Bank of the Spanish Group for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (GETH). Genotyping of the polymorphisms of interest, rs8193036 (-737C>T), rs2275913 (-197G>A), rs3819024 (-444A>G), rs4711998 (-877A>G), were performed by multiplex primer extension followed by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF; Sequenom MassArray). Results Genotype frequencies are shown in Table 2 and the association between IL-17A genotypes and complications after allo-SCT are shown in Table 3. Patients transplanted from donors harboring genotype CC for the SNP rs8193036 show increased risk of grade III-IV acute GvHD (7/26 vs 47/397, p=0.035) and of grade II-IV acute GvHD (13/26 vs 133/409, p=0.048). Patients transplanted from donors harboring allele A in the SNP rs4711998 show increased risk of extensive chronic GvHD (53/161 vs 43/177, p=0.045). Relapse rate was not related with IL-17A SNP genotypes. Finally a higher risk of toxicity-related mortality (TRM) was observed in patients transplanted from donors harboring allele A for SNP rs2275913 (78/293 vs 46/227, p=0.048), donors harboring allele G for SNP rs3819024 (78/279 vs 46/242, p=0.011) and donors harboring allele A for SNP rs4711998 (68/250 vs 55/229, p=0.044). Conclusions IL-17A SNP genotyping might be useful to anticipate complications after sibling HLA-identical allo-SCT and, therefore, to improve the clinical management of transplanted patients. This results further support the idea of a genetic predisposition to certain complications after allo-SCT.
