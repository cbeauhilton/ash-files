    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1783 Background CLL follows a highly variable clinical course. Evidence suggests that BCR signaling is a driving event in disease onset and progression. SCNP is a multiparametric flow cytometry-based assay that measures changes in intracellular signaling proteins in response to modulators, providing a functional measure of pathway activity. In prior studies using samples collected from patients with Binet Stage A CLL but at different time points in the natural history of their disease, an association between elevated BCR signaling and shorter TTFT was observed (Cesano et al. ASH 2011 Abstract 2834). In order to assess the correlation of CLL biology (measured by SCNP) and clinical course in a clinically more homogeneous population, samples collected as part of a clinical trial from elderly patients with previously untreated CLL prior to therapy initiation were assessed. Objectives 1) To confirm the association between \u03b1IgM-induced (\u2192) p-ERK signaling and TTFT in an independent CLL patient cohort, and 2) to identify additional associations between signaling and prognostic, molecularly defined clinical subgroups (i.e. IGHV and p53 mutational status). Methods: 29 evaluable cryopreserved CLL peripheral blood patient samples were collected between November 2008 and January 2010 as part of a Phase II trial. These studies were not part of the trial. Of the 29 samples, 20 were IGHV unmutated and 12 had unfavorable cytogenetics (del11q22.3 and/or del17p13) with 2 carrying p53 mutations. SCNP analysis was performed to quantitatively measure 18 intracellular signaling proteins within CD19 + CD5 + CLL cells using a panel of 14 disease-relevant modulators. Cox Proportional Hazards regression was performed and Kaplan\u2013Meier curves were used to assess signaling associations with TTFT in the 24 Binet A/B samples, as the prior TTFT association with BCR signaling was identified in Binet A samples. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and logistic regression were used to identify signaling associations with p53 and IGHV mutational status. Results: Consistent with prior studies, \u03b1IgM\u2192p-ERK signaling was associated with TTFT (p=0.05, likelihood ratio (LR) test). Notably, the combination of SDF1\u03b1 and \u03b1IgM modulation induced greater p-ERK signaling than observed with either agent alone and displayed a stronger association with TTFT (p=0.02) ( Figure 1 A). For this cohort, only the IGHV mutational status (p=0.01) ( Figure 1 B) and not cytogenetic risk categories, CD38, or ZAP-70 showed a significant association with TTFT. In addition, combining IGHV with \u03b1IgM\u2192p-ERK did not improve predictive power. Significant associations to IGHV unmutated status ( Figure 2 A) included multiple nodes modulated by \u03b1IgM (p-ERK, p-PLC\u03b32, p-SYK). The strength of this relationship was greater using concurrent stimulation with \u03b1IgM+SDF1\u03b1. R848 (TLR7/8 agonist) and thapsigargin (Ca 2+ influx) signaling were also increased in the unmutated samples. Finally, since the induction of p21 is in part regulated by p53 we tested the hypothesis that the lack of p21 induction by the DNA damaging agent, bendamustine, will be associated with p53 mutations. Samples with high spontaneous apoptosis in the absence of drug were removed prior to unblinding. Of the 13 evaluable samples, there was a significant association to p53 mutational status and p21 induction by bendamustine (p=0.0125, LR test, Figure 2 B). Conclusions: These data confirm the association of BCR and BCR+SDF1\u03b1 signaling with disease progression in CLL, and the potential for SCNP to identify patients more likely to require early treatment. These data support the potential utility of SCNP to: (1) identify in one assay those patients with a more aggressive form of CLL, including both unmutated IGHV and p53 pathway alterations, and (2) identify patients with signaling profiles who may be more likely to respond to targeted therapies.
