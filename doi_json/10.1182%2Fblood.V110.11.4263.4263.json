    "abstract_text": "Background: Tissue necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 is a naturally occurring cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of several hematologic malignancies, but an independent prognostic role for TNF-\u03b1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has not been established. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between TNF-\u03b1 levels and pretreatment characteristics and clinical outcomes in these diseases. Methods: From 9/94 through 1/01, serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 were prospectively measured in 198 patients with AML or high-risk MDS. Serum TNF-\u03b1 was quantified using commercially available ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (lower limits of sensitivity were 4.4 pg/mL). The appropriate recombinant cytokine was used to create a standard curve for each cytokine, and serum level was ascertained using the appropriate standard curve. All values represent the means of 3 sets of duplicate experiments. Results: The median patient age of the 198 patients with serum TNF-\u03b1 measurements was 65 years (range, 21\u201384 years); 62% were \u2265 60 years. Cytogenetics were favorable in 6% of patients, intermediate in 53%, poor-risk in 38%, and 3% of patients had insufficient metaphases or unknown cytogenetics. Zubrod performance status (PS) was 0\u20131 in 66% of patients, 2 in 25%, and 3\u20134 in 9%. Forty-nine percent had a history of an antecedent hematologic disorder (AHD), and 93% received ara-C-based therapy. High TNF-\u03b1 levels were associated with poor Zubrod PS (cor= .28); high levels of \u03b2 2 microglobulin (cor=.50), creatinine (cor=.35), uric acid (p=.35), or LDH (p=.32); low albumin levels (cor=\u2212.22); and longer duration of AHD (cor=.74) (p<.0001 for all variables). High TNF-\u03b1 levels were more common in patients with AML (vs. MDS, p=.026) and M4-M5 subtypes according to the French-American-British classification (p=.02). The median follow-up of surviving patients was 5.6 years. Clinical outcomes by TNF-\u03b1 are shown in the Table:  TNF-\u03b1 (pg/mL_ . TNF-\u03b1 <10pg/mL . TNF-\u03b1 \u226510 pg/mL . p-value .

Factors independently prognostic of longer survival were younger age (p=.0008), better-risk cytogenetics (p=.049), lower TNF-\u03b1 levels (p=.049), lower leukocyte counts (p=.003), higher hemoglobin levels (p=.03), lower \u03b2 2 -microglobulin levels (p=.03), female gender (p=.02), no history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy (p=.02), and race other than African American (p=.02). Factors independently prognostic of longer event-free survival (EFS) were better-risk cytogenetics (p=.002), lower \u03b2 2 -microglobulin levels (p=.008), lower leukocyte counts (p=.03), and younger age (p=.04). Conclusions: These data indicate that an elevated serum TNF-\u03b1 level is associated among others with poorer Zubrod PS and higher levels of \u03b2 2 microglobulin and it is an independent adverse prognostic factor for response and survival in the context of established prognostic factors for AML.",
