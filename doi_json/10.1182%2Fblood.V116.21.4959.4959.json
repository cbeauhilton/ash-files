    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4959 During the last few years (yrs) remarkable improvements have been made in the treatment of patients (pts) with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, there are only few analyses available on daily clinical practice, in particular on how pts are managed in the era of hypomethylating agents. For the first time, this analysis offers a comprehensive insight into diagnosis and management of MDS in Germany. Prior to patient documentation, 117 of 886 centers contacted provided information on patient load in a structural evaluation; the data collection period was scheduled accordingly. The data for this retrospective, non-interventional analysis were gathered during the 3 rd and 4 th quarter of 2009. 57 representative institutions documented 303 pts (41% from private-based offices [PBO], 59% from hospitals), 269 of which met the inclusion criteria (treatment decision, i.e. start, change or discontinuation, during data collection period; pts fully documented; positive plausibility check of data) of this analysis. Median age at the time of first diagnosis was 70 yrs. 78% had a Karnofsky Index (KI) \u2265 80%. The most common symptoms leading to diagnosis included cytopenia (e.g. anemia 79%), fatigue (38%), and deteriorating performance (36%). Distribution among MDS types according to the FAB classification at the time of first diagnosis was: 32% RA, 16% RARS, 20% RAEB, 4% RAEB-T, 7% CMML (21% \u201cnot documented\u201d). According to WHO classification (2008), the distribution was: 17% RCUD, 12% RARS, 23% RCMD, 13% RAEB-I, 15% RAEB-II, 1% MDS-U, 5% MDS with del5q, 14% unknown/not classified as MDS. Cytogenetic analysis was performed in 67% of pts at initial diagnosis, but much less frequently (44%) in pts > 75 yrs (p 70 yrs). However, length of transfusion history and frequency of RBCT were higher in older pts. The IPSS score was calculated in 61% of all pts at diagnosis. IPSS score calculation depended on several factors, e.g. RBCT dependence prior to diagnosis, age, and WHO MDS type. On bivariate analysis, IPSS scoring at first diagnosis was done significantly less frequently in pts > 75yrs (p=0.014; see table) and significantly more frequently in pts belonging to WHO types RCUD, MDS del(5q) and RAEB I-II (p<0.001). The IPSS score was more regularly used in university hospitals than other institutions (p=0.001). On multivariate analysis, the WHO type of MDS was confirmed to be the most relevant predictor of physicians using the IPSS (p<0.001). When trying to identify factors driving active treatment (defined as chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation (SCT), immunosuppressants, hypomethylating or other novel agents) in this survey, bivariate analysis showed a significant correlation with age \u2264 75 yrs (p=0.007) and the WHO types of RCUD, MDS del(5q), and RAEB I-II (p=0.0019); multivariate analysis revealed age as the most important factor (p=0.006; see table). MDS initial treatment was as follows: Supportive care only (34%), G-CSF/ESA only (16%), azacitidine (19%), any other active treatment (27%), and allogeneic SCT (5%). Azacitidine was the active treatment most frequently used (44 % overall) in MDS pts. Table: Impact of age on MDS diagnosis and treatment  . Pts \u2264 75yrs . Pts >75yrs . Significance . % of pts with cytogenetic analysis performed at first diagnosis 72.9% 43.7% p<0.001 % of pts with assessment of IPSS score 65.4% 51.0% p=0.014 % of pts receiving active treatment 39.7% 22.2% p=0.006 .

Proper risk assessment, however, is important for correct and consistent therapeutic decision-making, particularly with the availability of treatment options that offer a significant survival benefit to defined groups of patients.
