    "abstract_text": "Abstract 288 Introduction: Recent genomic analyses of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients have provided new information on mutations contributing to the disease onset and progression. However, the genomic changes are often complex and highly diverse from one patient to another and often not actionable in clinical care. To rapidly identify novel patient-specific therapies, we developed a high-throughput drug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT) platform to experimentally validate therapeutic options for individual patients with relapsed AML. By integrating the results with exome and transcriptome sequencing plus proteomic analysis, we were able to define specific drug-sensitive subgroups of patients and explore predictive biomarkers. Methods: Ex vivo DSRT was implemented for 29 samples from 16 adult AML patients at the time of relapse and chemoresistance and from 5 healthy donors. Fresh mononuclear cells from bone marrow aspirates (>50% blast count) were screened against a comprehensive collection of cytotoxic chemotherapy agents (n=103) and targeted preclinical and clinical drugs (n=100, later 170). The drugs were tested over a 10,000-fold concentration range resulting in a dose-response curve for each compound and each leukemia sample. A leukemia-specific drug sensitivity score (sDSS) was derived from the area under each dose response curve in relation to the total area, and comparing leukemia samples with normal bone marrow results. The turnaround time for the DSRT assay was 4 days. All samples also underwent deep exome (40\u2013100\u00d7) and transcriptome sequencing to identify somatic mutations and fusion transcripts, as well as phosphoproteomic array analysis to uncover active cell signaling pathways. Results: The drug sensitivity profiles of AML patient samples differed markedly from healthy bone marrow controls, with leukemia-specific responses mostly observed for molecularly targeted drugs. Individual AML patient samples clustered into distinct subgroups based on their chemoresponse profiles, thus suggesting that the subgroups were driven by distinct signaling pathways. Similarly, compounds clustered based on the response across the samples revealing functional groups of compounds of both expected and unexpected composition. Furthermore, subsets of patient samples stood out as highly sensitive to different compounds. Specifically, dasatinib, rapalogs, MEK inhibitors, ruxolitinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, ponatinib, foretinib and quizartinib were found to be selectively active in 5 (31%), 5 (31%), 4 (25%), 4 (25%), 3 (19%), 3 (19%), 2 (13%), 2 (13%), and 1 (6%) of the AML patients ex vivo , respectively. DSRT assays of serial samples from the same patient at different stages of leukemia progression revealed patterns of resistance to the clinically applied drugs, in conjunction with evidence of dynamic changes in the clonal genomic architecture. Emergence of vulnerabilities to novel pathway inhibitors was seen at the time of drug resistance, suggesting potential combinatorial or successive cycles of drugs to achieve remissions in an increasingly chemorefractory disease. Genomic and molecular profiling of the same patient samples not only highlighted potential biomarkers reflecting the ex vivo DSRT response patterns, but also made it possible to follow in parallel the drug sensitivities and the clonal progression of the disease in serial samples from the same patients. Summary: The comprehensive analysis of drug responses by DSRT in samples from human chemorefractory AML patients revealed a complex pattern of sensitivities to distinct inhibitors. Thus, these results suggest tremendous heterogeneity in drug response patterns and underline the relevance of individual ex vivo drug testing in selecting optimal therapies for patients (personalized medicine). Together with genomic and molecular profiling, the DSRT analysis resulted in a comprehensive view of the drug response landscape and the underlying molecular changes in relapsed AML. These data can readily be translated into the clinic via biomarker-driven stratified clinical trials. Figures. View large Download slide A.
