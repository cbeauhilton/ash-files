    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3701 Background: Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is an indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) characterized by production of a monoclonal IgM paraprotein and variable CD20 expression due to the downregulation of CD20 as B cells differentiate into plasma cells. Rituximab monotherapy (R) achieves an overall response rate (ORR) of 25\u201350% in therapy nai\u0308ve and relapsed WM and is associated with IgM flares in 25\u201375% of patients (pts) that potentially lead to hyperviscosity due to a rapid rise in IgM. Ofatumumab (OFA) is a fully human monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody approved for the treatment of fludarabine and alemtuzumab-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and has demonstrated activity in indolent B-NHL. Since OFA is active in CLL, with its low CD20 expression, we initiated a phase II single-arm trial of OFA in pts with WM. We report primary endpoint data from this study. Methods: Pts (age \u2265 18 years) with WM requiring therapy by 2 nd International Workshop on WM (IWWM) criteria were eligible. Cycle 1 (C1) of therapy consisted of OFA 300 mg week 1 and 1000 mg weeks 2\u20134 (Treatment Group A [TGA]) or OFA 300 mg week 1 and 2000 mg weeks 2\u20135 (TGB). Premedication included acetaminophen and antihistamine (all infusions) and glucocorticoid (infusions 1 and 2). Pts with grade 3\u20134 infusion-related adverse events (AEs) during weeks 1 and 2 also received glucocorticoid during weeks 3\u20135. Pts with stable disease (SD) or a minor response (MR) at week 16 of cycle 1 were eligible to receive a re-dosing cycle (C2) consisting of OFA 300 mg week 1 and 2000 mg weeks 2\u20135. The primary endpoint was ORR assessed by 3 rd IWWM criteria. Toxicity was assessed according to NCI-CTCAE, v 3.0. Results: Thirty-seven pts were enrolled between March 2009 and February 2011. Median age was 63 years (range 43\u201385); 22 pts were male. Median IgM level was 3.11 g/dL (range 0.81\u20138.64); median hemoglobin (hgb) was 9.8 g/dL (range 5.3\u201313.2). Nine pts were treatment nai\u0308ve; 28 pts had received a median of 3 prior therapies (range 1\u20135) including R (25 pts) and purine analog (14 pts). The first 15 pts were enrolled in TGA and the next 22 pts in TGB; pt characteristics were similar in both groups. Thirty-four pts completed C1; 1 pt withdrew after 1 dose and 2 pts received only 3 doses due to serious AEs (SAEs). Eleven pts achieved partial response (PR) and 7 achieved MR after C1 (ORR=49%; 95% CI [32%, 66%]). Twelve pts received C2, after which 4 pts improved their response (1 MR to PR, 1 SD to PR, 2 SD to MR) and 1 nonevaluable pt attained MR. After C1 and C2, the ORR was 59% (13 PR, 9 MR; 95% CI [42%, 75%]). Responses were seen in 67% (6/9) of therapy nai\u0308ve pts, 57% (16/28) of relapsed pts, 52% (13/25) of pts who had prior R, 75% (9/12) of R-nai\u0308ve pts, 64% (16/25) of pts with IgM < 4 g/dL and 50% (6/12) of pts with IgM \u2265 4 g/dL. ORR was 47% (7/15) in TGA and 68% (15/22) in TGB. ORR in TGA was negatively affected by prior R exposure and IgM \u2265 4 g/dL, whereas ORR in TGB was not affected by prior therapy, prior R or IgM level. Fifteen of 26 (58%) pts with hgb < 11.0 g/dL experienced \u2265 3.0 g/dL increase in hgb (range 3.0\u20137.1). Infusion-related events occurred with dose 1 in 30 (81%) pts and with dose 2 in 21 (57%) pts; all infusion events were grade 1\u20132 except 4 grade 3 events (1 rash, 1 chest pain, 1 chest discomfort, 1 back pain). Fifteen pts developed 22 infections including 8 upper respiratory tract, 4 urinary tract (UTI) and 4 sinus infections; all infections were grade 1\u20132 except 1 grade 3 UTI. One pt developed grade 3 febrile neutropenia. In total, there were 14 grade 3\u20134 AEs (all grade 3). Five pts developed 8 SAEs possibly related to OFA. One pt withdrew due to grade 3 hemolytic anemia. Two pts with baseline IgM of 6.63 and 4.75 g/dL required plasmapheresis for grade 3 renal insufficiency and hyperviscosity symptoms, respectively, with resolution of symptoms and were able to complete C1. Two pts developed IgM flare, defined as > 25% rise in IgM followed by subsequent MR or PR. Conclusions: OFA is clinically active in pts with WM, with an acceptable toxicity profile and a lower incidence (5%) of IgM flare. The ORR to OFA was 59% (TGA 47%, TGB 68%) including a 50% ORR (TGA 17%, TGB 83%) in pts with IgM \u2265 4.0 g/dL. Pts' anemia responded to OFA with 58% of pts with baseline hgb < 11.0 g/dL experiencing \u2265 3.0 g/dL increase in hgb. TGB achieved ORR > 60% in all pt groups regardless of prior therapy or baseline IgM level. A higher dose of OFA appeared to be more effective in pts previously exposed to R or with baseline IgM \u2265 4.0 g/dL. Further study of OFA in WM is warranted.
