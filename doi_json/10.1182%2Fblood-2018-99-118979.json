    "abstract_text": "Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) is an NIH/NHGRI-funded effort dedicated to building an authoritative central resource that defines the clinical relevance of genes and variants for use in precision medicine and research. ClinGen has developed both gene and variant expert panels to adapt the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines for consistent and accurate variant classification of specific genes and diseases. Here, we describe a new effort initiated in 2018 and supported by the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in collaboration with ClinGen to develop expert panels. This effort was motivated by the increasing use of genomics in clinical hematology and the lack of resources containing expert interpretation of germline variation. This panel, named the ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel is focused on the curation and annotation of variants in genes associated with familial/inherited risk for myeloid malignancies. Our team consists of expert clinicians, clinical laboratory diagnosticians, and researchers interested in developing and implementing standardized protocols for sequence variant specific annotations of genes in inherited myeloid malignancies. The optimization of the ACMG/AMP guidelines encompasses disease-/gene-informed specifications or strength adjustments of existing rules, including defining gene-specific population frequency cutoffs, and specifying recommendations for the use of computational/predictive data, as supported by published functional and clinical data in addition to guidance on ACMG/AMP variant interpretation provided by the ClinGen effort. Our initial focus has been to organize sub-groups of teams to develop approaches for evaluating ACMG/AMP codes to interpret germline variants of the RUNX1 gene. Once the curation of RUNX1 variants is underway, we will extend our focus to include CEBPA, DDX41, ETV6 , and GATA2 . These efforts will be bolstered by encouraging submission of existing variant interpretations to ClinVar or other public variant databases by the Hematology community. In summary, the ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel aims to develop recommendations to optimize ACMG/AMP criteria for standardization of variant interpretation in myeloid leukemia genes and make expert-reviewed and interpreted variants available to the hematology community through ClinVar and the ClinGen website (www.clinicalgenome.org) to support patient care and research.
