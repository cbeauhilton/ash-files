    "abstract_text": "Since the identification of the JAK family of intracellular tyrosine kinases and their downstream signaling partners, the STATs (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription), evidence has accumulated that activation of JAK signaling pathways can contribute to proliferation and survival of cancer cells. A direct link to oncogenesis was made when an activated form of JAK2 (JAK2 V617F) was identified in the majority of patients with myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) including approximately half of patients with myelofibrosis (MF). Introduction of this JAK2 mutation into the bone marrow of mice induced erythrocytosis [ Wernig et al. ( 2006 ) Blood  107 : 4274 ] supporting JAK2 as a relevant target for treatment of myeloproliferative disorders. We have identified a novel small molecule inhibitor of JAK2, XL019, which may prove to have utility in treating MPDs. XL019 is a potent and reversible inhibitor of the JAK2 enzyme, with a K i of 2 nM, and shows excellent selectivity (minimum of 50-fold selectivity against >120 protein kinases tested including other JAK family members). XL019 downregulates STAT signaling in cell lines expressing both wild type and activated forms of JAK2. IC50s for inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation by XL019 ranged from 623 nM (HEL92.1.7) to 3398 nM (KG-1) in tumor cell lines. XL019 showed increased potency in primary human erythroid cells in vitro , where the IC50 for inhibition of EPO-stimulated phospho-STAT5 was 64 nM. XL019 inhibits proliferation in cell lines harboring activated or overexpressed JAK2, including certain lines derived from patients with Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (L-1236, 928 nM IC50), AML (MV4-11, 992 nM IC50), essential thrombocythemia (SET-2, 386 nM IC50), and erythroleukemia (HEL92.1.7, 6777 nM IC50). Preclinical single-dose pharmacodynamic studies demonstrate a potent effect of XL019 on JAK-STAT signaling in HEL92.1.7, CFPAC-1 and DU 145 xenograft tumors. Twice daily dosing (bid) led to substantial tumor growth inhibition in the DU145 and HEL models (maximum tumor growth inhibition of 86% and 60%, respectively), accompanied by increases in tumor cell apoptosis (4 \u2013 4.4 fold increase) and decreases in tumor microvasculature (44% reduction in DU 145 xenograft tumors). Based on these encouraging data, XL019 is being evaluated in subjects with primary or post PV/ET MF in a Phase I dose escalation study, which has completed enrollment of the first cohort. The primary objectives of this study are to determine the safety and tolerability of XL019 when administered orally once daily for 21 days in 28 day cycles. Secondary objectives include determination of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of XL019, and to evaluate response using the International Working Group for MF consensus response criteria. We have developed a flow-based mechanistic assay for JAK2 activity, which measures GM-CSF-stimulated phospho-STAT5 in peripheral granulocytes in whole blood samples. Additional pharmacodynamic assessments for this study include JAK2 V617F allele burden, erythropoietin-independent colony formation, cytokine levels, and changes in bone marrow histology. Our initial findings regarding the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, tolerability and efficacy of XL019 in MF patients will be presented.",
