    "abstract_text": "SGN-30 is a chimeric monoclonal antibody which recognizes the CD30 antigen found on tumor cells from patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease (HD) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Preclinical studies with this agent have demonstrated anti-lymphoma effects in both in vitro cell line assays and in vivo murine model systems. The results of a multi-dose phase I study showed minimal toxicity associated with doses from 2 to 12 mg/kg administered as six weekly IV infusions over 120 minutes each. Of the 21 patients with Hodgkin\u2019s Disease accrued to the phase I study, four patients had stable disease (SD). A phase II multi-dose study is currently underway to further evaluate the safety, antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics of six weekly IV infusions of 6 mg/kg of SGN-30 in patients with relapsed or refractory HD or systemic ALCL (sALCL). Fifteen subjects (6M, 9F) with HD have been enrolled, with baseline data as follows: median age 34 (range 20\u201365), median number of prior therapies 3 (range 1\u20135), and 11 patients (73%) have disease which progressed after prior high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. Multiple doses of SGN-30 have been well tolerated in all subjects. Drug-related adverse events have been typically mild and consistent with monoclonal antibody administration. The most common drug-related adverse event has been fatigue. No grade 3/4 events have occurred. Twelve patients are currently evaluable for response, with 6 having had stabilization of their disease. Assessment of duration of disease stabilization and response is continuing. While the acceptable safety profile and frequency of stable disease following therapy in this heavily pretreated patient population are encouraging, a 12 mg/kg/dose regimen is now being tested in subsequent subjects to further explore the dose-response relationship of SGN-30 in Hodgkin\u2019s Disease. Further evaluation of this novel immunotherapy in additional HD patients is ongoing."
