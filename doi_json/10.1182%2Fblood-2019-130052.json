    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Genomic studies of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have uncovered >80 potential driver mutations. The vast majority of these mutations affect coding regions, and just two potential drivers have been identified in non-coding elements. Aim: To describe the biological and clinical impact of a recurrent A>C mutation at the third base of the small nuclear RNA U1, the non-coding component of the spliceosome involved in the recognition of the 5' splice site (5'SS). Methods: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA-seq from 318 CLL patients were used to identify and characterize a highly recurrent A>C point mutation occurring at position 3 of the U1 snRNA gene (g.3A>C mutation). The U1 wild-type and mutant forms were introduced into three CLL cell lines (JVM3, HG3, MEC1) to validate in vitro the predicted effect of this alteration. We screened two independent cohorts including a total of 1,314 CLL patients for the presence of the mutation using the rhAmp SNP genotyping assay, and integrated the U1 mutational status with well-known driver alterations, IGHV and epigenetic subgroups, and clinical parameters. Results: The U1 mutation was found in 8/78 (10.3%) CLL cases analyzed by WGS. Given its role in 5'SS recognition by base-pairing, we reasoned that this mutation was likely to alter the splicing and expression patterns of CLL. We were able to confirm widespread specific alterations in the transcriptome by comparing RNA-seq data between wild-type and g.3A>C mutated samples. Applying this knowledge to an algorithm aimed to infer the U1 mutational status from expression data, we were able to identify 4 mutated cases among 240 additional cases that had RNA-seq but no WGS. In total, 12/318 (3.8%) CLL patients analyzed by WGS and/or RNA-seq harbored this mutation. This g.3A>C U1 mutation changes the preferential A-U base-pairing between U1 and 5'SS to C-G base-pairing, creating novel splice junctions and altering the splicing pattern of 3,193 introns in 1,519 genes. In addition to altered splicing, 869 genes were differentially expressed between mutated and wild-type cases. We identified specific cancer genes (e.g. MSI2 , POLD1 , or CD44 ) and pathways (B-cell receptor signaling, promotion of apoptosis, telomere maintenance, among others) altered by the U1 mutation. To confirm a causal link between this mutation and splicing changes, we introduced exogenous U1 genes with or without the mutation into three cell lines. Subsequent RNA-seq of these cell lines recapitulated the altered splicing and expression patterns observed in CLL patients. We next screened for the presence of the U1 mutation 1,057 patients (cohort 1) using the rhAmp assay and it was found in 30 (2.8%) cases. The distribution of the mutation was similar in Binet stages and CLL vs monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. However, the U1 mutation was almost always found in IGHV unmutated CLL (29/30, p=9.0e-11) and within the na\u00efve-like CLL epigenetic subgroup (p=3.7e-7). None of the U1 mutated cases had mutations in the SF3B1 splicing factor. Considering only pre-treatment CLL samples, U1 mutation was associated with a shorter time to first treatment independently of the Binet stage, IGHV mutational status, epigenetic subgroups, and mutations in the well-known CLL drivers SF3B1 , NOTCH1 , ATM or TP53 . In cohort 2 (n=257), this mutation was found in 13 (5.1%) patients, confirming its enrichment in IGHV unmutated cases, na\u00efve-like epigenetic subgroup, and splicing modulation. Despite the relatively small number of pre-treatment samples carrying the U1 mutation (7/178) and short follow-up of the patients (median 2.6 years), the effect of this mutation on time to first treatment in cohort 2 was compatible with the one observed in cohort 1. Finally, we screened for the U1 mutation a cohort of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=108), mantle cell lymphoma (n=101), follicular lymphoma (n=87), splenic marginal zone lymphoma (n=12), acute myeloid leukemia (n=52), and myelodysplastic syndrome (n=67). The mutation was not present in any of the samples analyzed. Conclusions: Here we have reported that the third base of the small nuclear RNA U1 is recurrently mutated in CLL, proved its effect in splicing and gene expression, and shown that this mutation is independently associated with faster disease progression. The g.3A>C U1 mutation represents a novel non-coding driver alteration in CLL with potential clinical and therapeutic implications. Disclosures Ramirez Payer: GILEAD SCIENCES: Research Funding.
