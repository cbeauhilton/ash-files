    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1754 Introduction: The development of the escalated BEACOPP regimen let to an improved outcome in patients with advanced Hodgkin\u2018s lymphoma (HD9 study of the GHSG). However, the application of high dose etoposide (cumulative 4,8 g/m 2 per 8 cycles) seems to be associated with an increased incidence of secondary MDS and AML, respectively. Therefore, the aim of our multicenter pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the etoposide-free as well as dose-intensified BACOPP-D protocol. Methods: From May 2000 until August 2008 a total of 139 untreated patients with Hodgkin\u2018s lymphoma (HL) stage IIB, III, and IV were treated with BACOPP-D which included cyclophosphamide 1250 mg/m 2 (d1), adriamycin 25 mg/m 2 (d1+2), dacarbazine 250 mg/m 2 (d1-3), procarbazine 100 mg/m 2 (d1-7), prednisolone 40 mg/m 2 (d1-14), bleomycin 10 mg/m 2 (d8) and vincristine 1,4 mg/m 2 (maximum 2 mg, d8) at three-weekly intervals with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). A consolidating involved field radiation (30 Gy) was performed only in patients who achieved less than CR following chemotherapy. Post-treatment follow-up included PET imaging. Results: All patients (median age 34 years, range 16\u201365; 86 male, 53 female) are assessable for toxicity and treatment outcome. We analyzed the acute toxicity for 1060 cycles of BACOPP-D. CTC grade III/IV haematological toxicities per patient were observed as follows: leukopenia 92%, anemia 40%, and thrombocytopenia 35%. CTC grade III/IV non-haematological side effects included documented infection (8%) and lung toxicity (one patient). Consolidation radiotherapy was given in 73 patients (52,5%). A total of 125 patients (89,9%) achieved complete remission, 9 patients (6,5%) achieved partial remission, five patients (3,6%) had progressive disease. At a median observation time of 46 months (5-109 months), 9 patients (6,5%) have relapsed, and 11 deaths were documented (4 HL-specific and 4 treatment related deaths, 1 death due to ruptured Meckel diverticulum with peritonitis, one 65 year-old woman died in CR following myocardial infarction and 1 death due to secondary malignancy). Only two patients developed a second neoplasia (hypopharyngeal carcinoma in an alcoholic; melanoma). The overall survival and progression free survival rates at 46 months were 89,7% and 85,9%, respectively. Discussion: BACOPP-D regimen appears as a feasible and effective treatment which induced a complete morphologic remission in a high proportion of patients with advanced HL. The treatment was associated with moderate acute toxicity. No secondary AML or MDS occurred so far. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
