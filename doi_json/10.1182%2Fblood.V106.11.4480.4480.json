    "abstract_text": "Current classification of childhood leukemia relies on morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular characteristics. aBL is rare and poorly understood. We retrospectively evaluated 7 patients diagnosed with aBL according to European Group for Immunological Classification of Leukemias (EGIL) criteria(2 or more lineages with a score greater than 2).  View large View Large Among 269 leukemia patients diagnosed in 2001\u20132004, 7 (2.6%) were classified as having aBL.

Induction treatment consisted of AML-type therapy (CCG 2891 /COG AAML03P1) in 2 patients who achieved CR by day 28. Two patients received ALL-type therapy (CCG 1961) and entered CR by Day 28. Three patients required dose intensification due to induction failure: 2 switched from ALL to AML-type therapy. Post induction chemotherapy was given in 4 cases; allogeneic HSCT in 3 cases (2 in CR1; 1 in 2nd relapse). 2/4 and 2/3, respectively, remain alive in 1st CR after chemotherapy or HSCT. All 3 deaths were from relapse of aBL within 2 yrs from diagnosis & occured in adolescents with complex karyotypes. In our experience, pediatric aBL represents a high risk population, especially in adolescents. Intensive induction chemotherapy is necessary in the majority of cases to achieve CR, although it is unclear whether ALL or AML-type therapy is superior. MLL & t(9;22) may not be as common in pediatric aBL as previously described. Collaborative trials and biologic studies are clearly needed for better understanding and outcomes.",
