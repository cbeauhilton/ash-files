    "abstract_text": "Background Ruxolitinib is a potent JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor that has demonstrated rapid and durable reductions in splenomegaly, improved MF-related symptoms and quality of life (QoL), and prolonged survival in 2 phase 3 studies comparing ruxolitinib with placebo (COMFORT-I) and best available therapy (COMFORT-II). However, no clinical trial in pts with MF had been conducted in Asian countries, and only a limited number of Asian pts or healthy volunteers had been enrolled in any ruxolitinib study. Methods This study was an open-label phase 2 study evaluating ruxolitinib in Asian pts with PMF, PPV-MF, or PET-MF who had palpable splenomegaly \u2265 5 cm below the costal margin and intermediate-2\u2013 or high-risk MF by the International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) criteria. Pts received starting doses of ruxolitinib 15 or 20 mg twice daily (bid) based on baseline platelet count (100-200 or > 200 \u00d7 10 9 /L, respectively); dose adjustments balancing safety and efficacy were allowed to titrate each pt to their most appropriate dose. The primary endpoint was met if the proportion of pts achieving \u2265 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline at week 24 was \u2265 27.5% as measured by MRI/CT. Symptomatic response was assessed as a secondary endpoint using the 7-day modified MF Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) v2.0 total symptom score (TSS) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). The study was conducted in China (n = 63), Japan (n = 30), Korea (n = 17), and Taiwan (n = 10). The data cutoff date for this analysis was 7 June 2013. Results Overall, 120 pts were enrolled (PMF, n = 80; PPV-MF, n = 21; PET-MF, n = 19), and their baseline characteristics were as follows: median age, 61 years (range, 25-80 years); 51.7% female; 69.2% intermediate-2 and 30.8% high risk by IWG-MRT criteria; median palpable spleen size, 15 cm (range, 5-45 cm); median spleen volume, 2159 cm 3 ; 55.8% of pts had prior exposure to hydroxyurea. The median follow-up was 8.44 months; 22.5% of pts discontinued treatment, primarily for adverse events (AEs; 9.2%) and disease progression (7.5%). The median duration of treatment was 8.44 months (range, 0.5-21.7 months), and the median daily dose was 20.64 mg/day in the 15 mg bid group (n = 46) and 36.11 mg/day in the 20 mg bid group (n = 74). All pts were evaluable for achievement of the primary endpoint, 101 pts remained on study and were evaluable at week 24, and 96 pts had nonzero scores on the MFSAF-TSS and were evaluable for a reduction from baseline. Most pts who had assessments at week 24 (91% [92/101]) had a reduction from baseline in spleen volume ( Figure ). The study met the primary endpoint, with 31.7% (38/120) of all pts achieving \u2265 35% reduction from baseline at week 24. Overall, 38.3% (46/120) of pts achieved \u2265 35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume at any time on study. As measured by the 7-day MFSAF, 49% (47/96) of pts achieved \u2265 50% reduction from baseline in TSS (median reduction, 47.2%). Pts experienced an improvement from baseline at week 24 in EORTC global health status/QoL (mean change, 5.2).

Serious AEs were reported for 24.2% of pts, and 65.8% of all pts had grade 3/4 AEs. The most common new or worsening laboratory abnormalities were low hemoglobin (all grade 3, 55.7%), low lymphocyte (grade 3/4, 19.5%), low platelet (grade 3/4, 15.3%), and low ANC (grade 3/4, 7.6%) levels. AEs observed in this study were consistent with those observed in the 2 large phase 3 COMFORT studies. Six pts (5%) died on treatment or within 30 days of discontinuation. Summary/conclusions Findings from this study demonstrated that ruxolitinib was relatively well tolerated in Asian pts with MF and provided substantial reductions in splenomegaly and modest improvements in MF-associated symptoms. The AEs observed with ruxolitinib treatment in this study are consistent with those observed in the large phase 3 COMFORT studies, and there were no new AEs associated with ruxolitinib in Asian pts with MF.
