    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2365 Large lymph node size or chemo-refractoriness limited the success of nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT in eradicating CLL or lymphoma. We explored an approach of combining the cyto-reductive effect of high dose chemo/radiation therapy and autologous HCT with the graft-versus-tumor effect of nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT for pts with rapidly progressive/refractory CLL or lymphoma. Between 4/2000 and 3/2010, 45 pts with advanced indolent (16%) or aggressive (54%) non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL, 18%), or CLL (11%) ineligible for myeloablative allogeneic HCT due to age and/or comorbidities were treated with the sequential approach. Autologous HCT alone was thought to be insufficient for disease control. Pts received high-dose therapy and autologous HCT followed [at a median of 65 (range 39\u2013128) days] by nonmyeloablative conditioning and related (n=28) or unrelated donors (n=17) allogeneic HCT. Median pt age was 49 (range 20\u201371) years and number of prior regimens was 4 (range 1\u201312). Thirty-four percent of pts had disease responsive to the last chemotherapy before autografting [30% partial (PR) and 4% complete remission (CR)] while 44% and 22% had refractory and progressive disease, respectively. Most pts had aggressive disease (72%). Conditioning for autografts consisted of BEAM (49%) or Cyclophosphamide/12 Gy TBI\u00b1VP16 (51%). After auto-grafting, 58% of pts had CR/PR (29%/29%), 36% had responses <PR, 3% had relapse, and 3% had refractory disease. Conditioning for allografts consisted of 2 Gy TBI alone (53%) or combined with FLU (47%), 90 mg/m 2 . Pts received G-CSF mobilized allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells. All 45 pts had sustained donor engraftment. Incidences of grades II, III, and IV acute and of chronic GVHD were 46%, 16%, 0%, and 52% respectively. With median follow up of 51 (range 5\u2013116) months, the overall response rate was 60% (46% CR). Eighteen pts died, 12 from progression/relapse, 3 from pulmonary complications, 1 from GVHD, 1 from sepsis, and 1 from multi-focal leuko-encephalopathy. Estimated 5-year rates of non-relapse mortality, relapse, overall, and progression-free survivals from the time of autografting were 15%, 44%, 55%, and 42% respectively. Pts with CLL or indolent NHL had rates of relapse and PFS of 11% and 68% compared to 47% and 37% for those with aggressive NHL and 69% and 31% for those with HL, respectively. No statistical significant differences in outcomes were detected for lymph node size ( Figure ), disease status at allografting, donor type, conditioning regimens for autografts or allografts, HCT-comorbidity index scores, or time between autologous and allogeneic grafting ( Table ). Sequential Auto-Allo HCT resulted in relatively low NRM with median survival not yet reached among pts with rapidly progressive lymphoma/CLL. This sequential transplant approach overcame the previously reported high relapse risk of bulky lymphadenopathy.
