    "abstract_text": "Chemical modifications of imatinib mesylate made with the guidance of molecular modeling yielded several promising compounds. Among them, we selected a compound denoted NS-187 (elsewhere described as CNS-9) on the basis of its affinity to Abl, and also to Lyn, which may be involved in imatinib-resistance (Figure). The most striking structural characteristic of NS-187 is its trifluoromethyl (CF 3 ) group at position 3 of the benzamide ring. The presence of the CF 3 group strengthened the hydrophobic interactionss of the molecule with the hydrophobic pocket of Abl. Another possible merit of the CF 3 group is that it may fix the conformation of the drug by hindering its rotation at the 4-position of the benzamide ring; as a result, a CF 3 -bearing molecule may be more potent than more flexible compounds such as imatinib. In fact, NS-187 was 25\u201355 times more potent than imatinib in vitro and and at least 10 times more potent than in vivo . NS-187 also inhibited the phosphorylation and growth of all Bcr-Abl mutants tested except T315I at physiological concentrations. Another special feature of NS-187, in addition to its increased affinity to Abl is its unique spectrum of inhibitory activity against protein kinases. At a concentration of 0.1 \u03bcM, NS-187 inhibited only four of 79 tyrosine kinases, that is, Abl, Arg, Fyn, and Lyn. Notably, at 0.1 \u03bcM NS-187 did not inhibit PDGFR, Blk, Src or Yes. The IC 50 values of NS-187 for Abl, Src and Lyn were 5.8 nM, 1700 nM and 19 nM, respectively, and those of imatinib were 106 nM, >10,000 nM and 352 nM, respectively. These findings indicate that NS-187 acts as a Bcr-Abl/Lyn inhibitor. In this respect, NS-187 may stand out among other novel Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors, because BMS-354825 inhibits all members of the Src family, while AMN-107 inhibits none of the Src-family kinases. Our proposed docking models of the NS-187/Abl complex support the notion that NS-187 is more specific for Lyn than for Src. The amino acid at position 252 is either Gln or Cys in Src-family proteins. NS-187 inhibited the Gln252-bearing proteins Abl, Fyn and Lyn but had lower activity against the Cys252-bearing Src and Yes. This is probably because Gln, unlike Cys, readily forms hydrogen bonds. The distinguishing characteristic of NS-187, its high affinity for and specific inhibition of Abl and Lyn, may be useful in the treatment of Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia patients.
