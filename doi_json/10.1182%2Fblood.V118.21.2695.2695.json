    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2695 Purpose: To evaluate potential differences in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) according to PET and CT disease status at completion of chemotherapy for patients with Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma. Patients and Methods: Subjects were 303 patients with histologically confirmed DLBCL treated between January 2001 and December 2007; no patient received radiation therapy. We evaluated: age, sex, Ann Arbor stage, bulky disease, International Prognostic Index score, Ki-67 expression, PET standardized uptake values (SUVs), disease status after chemotherapy and at last follow-up. Results: Median age was 61 years; 149 men; 81 (27%) had stage I-II, 242 (73%) stage III-IV. A total of 248 patients (82%) completed 6\u20138 cycles of doxorubicin-based therapy. On multivariate analysis, both OS and PFS were significantly influenced by: the presence of PET negative residual mass on CT at completion of therapy ( P < 0.001 for OS and P < 0.001 for PFS) ( Figure 1 ); number of cycles and type of chemotherapy ( P < 0.001 for OS and P < 0.001 for PFS); Combined presence (p=0.01 for OS and P=0.003 for PFS) of high Ki 67, high PET SUV, and bulky disease; and IPI score ( P = 0.001 for OS and P < 0.001 for PFS). Same factors remained significant when replacing response to therapy with size of the residual mass on CT ( Figure 2 ), or number of residual sites ( Figure 3 ) (p<0.0001 OS and p<0.0001 PFS).

These patients should be considered for biopsy and further consolidative therapy. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
