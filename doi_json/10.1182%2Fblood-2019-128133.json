    "abstract_text": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical parasitic disease caused by Leishmania parasites and only second to malaria in terms of worldwide morbidity and mortality. According to recent WHO report, there are 500,000 cases of VL worldwide leading to ~30,000 deaths per year. VL is endemic in 98 countries but the major disease burden is contributed by Brazil, India and Sudan. Disease manifestations include fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, immune dysregulations and extensive hematological complications. We have shown previously using experimental models of infection that the infiltration of CD4 + T cells results in disruption to the bone marrow environment, resulting in dysfunctional hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells self-renewal (Pinto et al, PLOS Pathogens, 2017) and aberrant medullary erythropoiesis causing pathological anemia (Preham et al, Frontiers in Immunology, 2018). Thrombocytopenia is also dominant hematological feature seen in both human and experimental models that may reflect either reduced platelet production or enhanced clearance. However, the mechanisms of VL-driven thrombocytopenia remain poorly understood. The aim of this study is to explore the possible underlying mechanisms from platelet production to phagocytic cells dependent clearance. Using a murine experimental model of VL, we demonstrate a steady decrease in the platelet count from d14 onwards in infected mice culminating in severe thrombocytopenia on d28 of infection (infected: 225.9 \u00b135.7 vs na\u00efve: 1005 \u00b190.6, x 10 6 /\u00b5l). Critically, thrombocytopenia is completely reversible after a single dose of liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome @ 8mg/kg bodyweight, IV) which clears parasites by delivering the drug directly to parasite harbouring tissue macrophages, thereby improving parasite clearance and reducing toxicity. Despite significant thrombocytopenia, the number and gross morphology of bone marrow megakaryocytes (MKs) were not altered, but MK ultrastructure studies using transmission electron microscopy identified significantly reduced demarcation membranes in infected mice compared to na\u00efve. Levels of plasma thrombopoietin (TPO), the key regulator of MK differentiation and platelet production, were decreased in infected vs na\u00efve mice (1254 \u00b1 95.49 vs 3249 \u00b1 125.1 pg/ml) and administration of exogenous TPO resulted in complete recovery of platelet counts. Given that the majority of TPO is produced by the liver, reduction in the levels of circulating TPO during infection is likely due to destruction of liver architecture by parasite loaded hepatic granulomas. Together, these data suggest that despite some changes in MK cytoplasmic maturation, the bone marrow microenvironment remains supportive of MK differentiation capacity during VL. As platelet production is not significantly altered by VL, we next determined effects on platelet clearance. Large number of highly active splenic macrophages are common in VL and are known for their phagocytic properties. Experiments conducted on VL-infected splenectomised mice demonstrated a reduction in thrombocytopenia compared to sham-operated infected mice (685 \u00b132 vs 297\u00b1 16, x 10 6 /\u00b5l) and showed a great response to exogenous TPO, implying splenic clearance may be involved in thrombocytopenia. Partial depletion of splenic macrophages in infected mice using clodronate liposomes did not alter platelet count, whereas neutrophil deletion (anti-Gr1 mAb @ 250ug/g IP) in infected mice resulted in a near 2-fold increase in platelet counts. Furthermore, circulating platelets in VL infected mice were IgG coated compared to naive which is likely to further enhance autoimmune platelet clearance. Severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding are important clinical manifestations of VL. Our findings clearly demonstrate that the mechanisms of thrombocytopenia in VL are multifactorial but do not cause permanent long term damage to the BM microenvironment. Critically, these changes could be reversed rapidly by clearing parasitemia, using TPO agonists to increase numbers of circulating platelets and/or by reducing platelet clearance. This highlights the possibility of re-evaluating the current treatment regimen in VL endemic countries by including therapeutic interventions aimed at reversing severe thrombocytopenia.
