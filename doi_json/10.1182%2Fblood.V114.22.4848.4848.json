    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4848 Background Myelodysplastic syndrome(MDS) belong to the most common hematological diseases however epidemiological data on MDS are sparse. Until 2008 there were no data about epidemiology of MDS in Poland. Methods From 03.2008-05.2009 we have registered 966 patients in Polish MDS Registry. We have included only alive patients of various time of diagnosis. Patients from 22 centers were diagnosed according to WHO 2001 criteria. Results There were 508(53%)males and 458(47%) females. Median age at diagnosis was 70(range 19-99). Under 50 were 83(9%) cases with preponderance of females- 51 cases( males 32cases), between 50-70 there were 353(41%) cases, half of the patients-432(50%) were above 70( 247 males and 185 females).Prior chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy had 37((3,8%) patients. Distribution of MDS subtypes was as follows: RA-170(20%) cases, RARS-58(7%), RCMD-244(28%), RCMD-RS-18(2%), RAEB-1-120(14%), RAEB-2-169(19,5%), 5q- -40(4,6%), MDS-U-44(5%).In 103(10%) subtype was not done. Karyotype was available in 276(28%) cases. Cytogenetic risk groups were: low risk-182(68%), intermediate-52(20%) and high risk-33(12%). The most frequent cytogenetic results were: normal karyotype 44%, isolated 5q deletion 19%, complex karyotype 6%, 5q deletion + another one change 3% and 5q deletion with at least 2 changes 3%. According to IPSS risk groups low risk was found in 61( 22%) of cases, intermediate-1 -130(48%), intermediate-2-47(17%) and high risk in 31(11,5%). Median values of Hb was 9,1 g/dL, plts 129 G/L, ANC 1,7 G/L. RBC transfusion dependent were 429(44%) patients and platelet transfusion dependent were 100( 11%) pts. At least 2 U/month RBC transfusion requirement was 140(14%) patients. Serum ferritin level was assessed in 530 cases-171 of them( 32%) had higher than 1000\u03bcg/L level. Conclusions We have observed predominance of females among MDS patients under 50. Half of the patients had RA or RCMD subtype. Isolated 5 q deletion was the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality. Forty four percentage of patients was RBC transfusion dependant. Serum ferritin level was significantly elevated in 32% of assessed patients at the moment of MDS diagnosis.
