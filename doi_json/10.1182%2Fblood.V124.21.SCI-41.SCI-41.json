    "abstract_text": "Stem cells (SCs) have the ability to self-renew long term and differentiate into one or more tissues. Typically, SCs are used sparingly to replenish cells during normal homeostasis. However, even SCs that are quiescent must be able to respond quickly to injury in order to fuel rapid tissue regeneration. How SCs balance self-renewal and differentiation is of fundamental importance to our understanding of normal tissue maintenance and wound repair. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory circuitry governing this balancing act is at the root of some types of tumors both in mice and in humans. The skin is an excellent model system to understand how SCs function in normal tissue generation and how this process goes awry in cancer. Many of the principles we have unearthed by studying skin stem cells have parallels to the hematopoietic system. We have identified quiescent and \u201cprimed\u201d/active SCs within the skin and shown that primed SCs have a lower threshold for activation to enter tissue regeneration. We have learned that during normal homeostasis, SC behavior is controlled not only through cues received from their microenvironment but also through signals emanating from their differentiating lineages. We have been dissecting how extrinsic signaling to SCs trigger a cascade of transcriptional changes that govern SC activation during tissue development, homeostasis and hair regeneration. Our findings provide new insights into our understanding of the process of SC activation, and in so doing have revealed mechanisms which are also deregulated in a variety of different human cancers. Our goal is to understand how SCs start and stop making tissue, and how this changes in cancer. Our recent discoveries on this topic have led us to the realm of identifying and characterizing cancer SCs (tumor-initiating cells) of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the skin. We developed a new method to knockdown genes specifically in skin and oral progenitors, enabling us to screen not only the differences between cancer and normal SCs, but also the myriad of gene alterations surfacing from the Human Cancer Sequencing project. Our screens have illuminated new oncogenes and tumor suppressors for SCCs, among the most prevalent and life-threating cancers world-wide that include cancers of lung, esophagus, breast, cervix, prostate, throat and oral tissues. Our findings are unearthing new targets for cancer therapeutics. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
