    "abstract_text": "This randomized phase III clinical trial was designed to evaluate the potential benefit and toxicity of giving two 25-day courses of arsenic trioxide as a first consolidation (0.15 mg/kg/d for 5d each wk for 5 wk) to half of newly diagnosed patients with APL who achieved remission (CR or PR) after induction with oral tretinoin (ATRA; 45 mg/m 2 /d), daunorubicin (50 mg/m 2 IV \u00d7 4d), and cytarabine (200 mg/m 2 CIV \u00d7 7d). Subsequent consolidation included 2 courses of ATRA (45 mg/m 2 \u00d7 7d) + daunorubicin (50 mg/m 2 \u00d7 3d; 2d for age < 15 yr) on both arms. CR patients were then randomized to 1 yr of maintenance with ATRA (7d repeated every other wk) with or without 6-mercaptopurine (daily) + methotrexate (wkly). 518 adults (15\u201379 yr) and 64 children (<15 yr; 11%) with untreated APL were enrolled by one of 5 cooperative groups (CALGB, ECOG, SWOG, COG, NCIC-CTG). Eligibility required demonstration of PML-RARA in one of 3 central labs. 52% were male; 73% were 15\u201360 yr old and 16% >60 yr old; 81% were white, 7% African American, 4% Hispanic, and 3% Asian. Performance status (PS) was 0 in 48%, 1 in 37%, 2 in 9%, and 3/4 in 6%. Body surface area (BSA) ranged from 0.37 to 3.19 m 2 . Results by treatment arm have not yet been released by the DSMB. There were 10 lethal adverse events among adults during induction that were either possibly, probably or definitely due to treatment; there were no lethal induction events among children. Maximum hematologic adverse events due to induction treatment were 7% grade (gr) 3 and 78% gr 4; maximum non-hematologic events due to treatment were 62% gr 3 and 23% gr 4. During consolidation therapy, there were no lethal events. Maximum hematologic adverse events due to treatment were 21% gr 3 and 58% gr 4 on the control arm, and 22% gr 3 and 54% gr 4 on the arsenic trioxide containing arm. Maximum non-hematologic adverse events due to consolidation treatment were 28% gr 3 and 5% gr 4 for the control arm and 43% gr 3 and 5% gr 4 for the arsenic trioxide containing arm. No gr 3/4 cardiac QTc prolongation was observed on the arsenic trioxide arm. Overall results confirm the validity of the European risk stratification scheme: Low (WBC \u226410,000 and platelets > 40,000); Intermediate (WBC \u2264 10,000 and platelets \u226440,000); High (WBC >10,000). Death during induction occurred in 2%, 4%, and 16%, respectively, in the 3 risk groups (p10,000 require better therapy to reduce both induction mortality and early relapses. Reporting on differences between treatment arms on this trial must await more events and further follow-up.",
