    "abstract_text": "Systemic PTCL, with the exception of alk-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), have a poor prognosis. ASCT has been shown to have a favourable impact on relapsed PTCL. Therefore, the NLG designed a prospective multicenter phase II study to evaluate the impact of a dose-intensified induction schedule (6 courses of two-weekly CHOEP) consolidated in 1st PR/CR with high-dose therapy (BEAM) followed by ASCT in previously untreated systemic PTCL. This is the largest prospective PTCL-specific trial published so far. Newly diagnosed non-primary cutaneous PTCL cases aged 18\u201367 yrs were eligible for enrollment. Cases of alk-positive ALCL were excluded. From Oct 2001 to Feb 2006, 99 histologically confirmed PTCL cases were included in the study: PTCL unspecified (n=41), alk-neg ALCL (n=24), AILT (n=15), enteropathy-type (n=12), panniculitis-like (n=3), T/NK nasal-type (n=2), hepatosplenic (n=2). The M/F ratio was 1.8 and the median age 55 yrs (range 20\u201367 yrs). Although almost 2/3 of the cases presented with advanced-stage disease (62%), B-symptoms (61%) and/or elevated s-LDH (63%), the majority of them (65%) had a good performance score (WHO 0\u20131) at diagnosis. Of the 77 patients, where information was available for all 6 induction courses, 68 (88%) were in CR (31) or PR (37) after the 3rd and 66 (86%) after the 6th course. A total of 58 patients (75%) went through ASCT indicating that at least a fourth of this younger patient cohort has a primary refractory disease and fails therapy before reaching the transplant. Treatment-related toxicity after both induction and high-dose treatment was manageable. Of the 58 transplanted patients, 50 (86%) were still in remission at re-evaluation short after transplant. In 39 patients follow-up data one year post-transplant were available: 30 are still in CR and 9 have relapsed, suggesting that post-transplant relapses probably account for another 25% of the original patient cohort. In conclusion, the present data indicate that a time- and dose-intensified schedule is feasible and effective in previously untreated systemic PTCL. Continuous remissions are not uncommon, but a longer follow-up is needed to further characterize long-term remission rates and evaluate their impact on time-to-treatment failure and overall survival.",
