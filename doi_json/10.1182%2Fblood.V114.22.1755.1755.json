The phase III AZA-001 study ( Lancet Oncol , 2009) showed azacitidine (AZA) prolonged overall survival (OS) regardless of IPSS cytogenetic risk category. This analysis assessed the effects of specific cytogenetic abnormalities on OS in patient (pt) subgroups treated with AZA or a conventional care regimen (CCR). Methods Pts with higher-risk MDS (FAB RAEB, RAEB-t, or CMML and IPSS Int-2 or High) were enrolled and randomized to receive AZA or CCR. CCR comprised 3 treatments: best supportive care only, low-dose ara-C, or induction chemotherapy. Erythropoietins were prohibited. OS was determined in subgroups of pts with del 5/5q-, del 7/7q-, or trisomy 8, each as part of a non-complex karyotype (<3 cytogenetic abnormalities) or as part of a complex karyotype (\u22653 cytogenetic abnormalities). OS was also analyzed in pts with combinations of del 5/5q- and/or del 7/7q- as part of non-complex or complex karyotypes ( Table ). Pt karyotype was determined at baseline. OS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods. A stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results A total of 358 pts were enrolled (AZA 179, CCR 179). Of them, 153 had normal karyotypes (AZA 77, CCR 76). Median OS in pts with normal karyotypes was not reached at 21.1 months with AZA vs 17.2 months (95%CI: 15.2 \u2013 24.1 months) with CCR; HR = 0.63 (95%CI: 0.39 \u2013 1.03). Of remaining pts, 136 had del 5/5q-, del 7/7q-, and/or trisomy 8 as part of a non-complex or complex karyotype. AZA was associated with longer OS vs CCR in all subgroups of pts with non-complex cytogenetics, with HRs ranging from 0.20 (95%CI: 0.06 \u2013 0.65) to 0.51 (95%CI: 0.05 \u2013 4.74) ( Table ). In both the AZA and CCR treatment groups, pts in all subgroups with non-complex karyotypes had substantially longer OS than pts with complex karyotypes. Pts with complex karyotypes in some subgroups had longer OS with AZA vs CCR: median OS in pts with del 5/5q-, del 5/5q- WITHOUT del 7/7q-, or trisomy 8 as part of a complex karyotype treated with AZA survived 5.1, 8.0, and 12.4 months longer, respectively, than their counterparts who received CCR. HRs with AZA vs CCR in pts with complex cytogenetics ranged from 0.42 (95%CI: 0.10 \u2013 1.69) to 0.55 (95%CI: 0.29 \u2013 1.05). Conclusions These findings support earlier data showing effectiveness of AZA in higher-risk MDS pts with complex or non-complex karyotypes. Major gains in OS were obtained with AZA vs CCR (12-18 months longer OS with AZA) for the following categories: del 7/7q- (non-complex), del 7/7q- WITHOUT del 5/5q- (non-complex), and trisomy 8 (non-complex and complex). Pts with trisomy 8 treated with AZA experienced a 3-fold increase in median OS compared with similar pts who received CCR. Longer OS (AZA 15.3 vs CCR 7.3 months) was also obtained for pts with del5/5q- WITHOUT del7/7q- as part of a complex karyotype. The worse cytogenetic categories, del 7/7q- and del 5/5q- AND del 7/7q-, both with complex karyotype, were associated with the poorest OS regardless of treatment. Pt subgroups in this post hoc analysis were small and heterogeneous; confirmation of these findings in larger pt samples is warranted.
