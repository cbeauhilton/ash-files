    "abstract_text": "The chimeric anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (Rituxan, IDEC-C2B8) is widely used in the clinical treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL). Rituximab sensitizes NHL B-cell lines to drug-induced apoptosis via selective down-regulation of Bcl- xL expression (Jazirehi et al., Mol. Cancer Therapeutics 2:1183, 2003). We hypothesized that rituximab-mediated down-regulation of Bcl- xL expression may be due, in part, to inhibition of constitutive NF- \u03baB activity that regulates Bcl- xL expression. This hypothesis was tested following treatment with rituximab of CD20+ drug-resistant Ramos (Bcl-2 \u2212 / Bcl- xL + ) and Daudi (Bcl-2 + / Bcl- xL + ) cell lines. Rituximab decreased the phosphorylation of NIK, IKK and \u03baB-I\u03b1, diminished IKK kinase activity and decreased NF- \u03baB DNA-binding activity. These events and down-regulation of Bcl- xL expression occurred with similar kinetics and were observed 3\u20136 h post rituximab treatment. The role of NF- \u03baB in the regulation of Bcl- xL transcription in both Ramos and Daudi cells was demonstrated by using 1) promoter reporter assays in which deletion of the two tandem NF- \u03baB binding sites in the upstream promoter region significantly reduced the luciferase activity 2) I\u03baB super-repressor expressing cells and 3) by NF- \u03baB specific inhibitors. The underlying mechanism of the inhibition of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by rituximab was shown to be due, in part, to upregulation of Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) expression, thus, interrupting the NF- \u03baB signaling pathway through the physical association between NIK and RKIP, which was concomitant with Bcl- xL down-regulation. The direct role of Bcl- xL in drug-resistance was evaluated by using Bcl- xL over-expressing Ramos cells, which exhibited higher resistance to drugs that was partially reversed by rituximab. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of action of rituximab-mediated signaling by inducing RKIP expression that negatively regulates the constitutive NF- \u03baB pathway resulting in Bcl- xL down-regulation and chemo-sensitization of the NHL B-cells. Furthermore, these findings identify several targets, namely RKIP, Bcl- xL and the components of the NF- \u03baB signaling pathway, for therapeutic intervention in combination with cytotoxic agents to reverse adaptive and acquired resistance of B-NHL.",
