    "abstract_text": "Pediatric-based therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been proposed as superior treatment for teen-agers and young adults with ALL. Several trials report improved survival rates in young adult ALL patients (pts) when treated with pediatric-based regimens. Augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (ABFM) treatment is effective treatment for ALL in adolescents up to age 21. In an attempt to improve cure rates in AYA pts with ALL, we administered ABFM therapy to pts age 12 to 40 in a prospective, single institution trial. Results were then retrospectively compared to the HYPER CVAD regimen, the historical adult ALL regimen used at our institution. 85 pts with de novo Philadelphia chromosome negative ALL have completed at least 6 months of therapy. There are 69 (81%) pts with pre-B ALL and 16 (18%) pts with T-cell ALL/lymphoma. The age range is 13-39 with a median of 21. The median WBC at diagnosis is WBC=14 thousand/microliter (range 0.4-494). 80/85 (94%) pts entered remission ( or </= 21 years, for presenting WBC over 50 thousand, and for MRD at the end of induction. In our hands, pediatric based therapy has significant though tolerable toxicity. Outcomes in AYA pts are similar but not superior to results obtained with historical ALL therapy.
