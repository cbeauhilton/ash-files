    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) remains incurable due to the development of a drug-resistant phenotype after prolonged therapy. Myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) is a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate that plays an important role in cell adhesion, spreading and invasion. Our previous studies found that overexpression of phospho-MARCKS ( p MARCKS) was detected in developed drug resistant MM cell lines (RPMI-8226 R5, MM.1R) relative to their parental drug sensitive cell lines (RPMI-8226S, MM.1S). We hypothesized that p MARCKS is involved in chemo- and novel drug resistance in MM. To further evaluate the drug resistance, we exposed both RPMI-8226 R5 and MM.1R cell lines to varying dosages of bortezomib, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, and lenalidomide. By MTT assay, both resistant cell lines were found to have significantly higher viability to all 4 drugs compared to their respective non-resistant lines. In addition, Western blot analysis showed increased p MARCKS expressions in all 3 bortezomib resistant cell lines 8226.BR, OPM2.BR, and ANBL-6.BR as compared to their respective bortezomib sensitive cell lines. We next acquired MM patient samples collected at diagnosis and at relapse after bortezomib treatment, and investigated their p MARCKS expression with immunoblotting analyses. The patient samples collected from relapse after bortezomib treatment had higher p MARCKS expression than those collected at diagnosis. Furthermore, we studied additional 3 primary MM patient samples with high p MARCKS expressions and 3 with low expressions for their vaibility after a 36 hour bortezomib treatment, and found that the samples with high p MARCKS expressions were more resistant to bortezomib than those with low p MARCKS expressions (mean IC 50 of 7.1 nM and mean IC 50 of 4.8 nM, respectively; p = 0.042). Importantly, combination of a low dosage of bortezomib (5.0 nM) with either 2.5 uM or 5.0 uM of enzastaurin (an inhibitor of phospho-PKC), displayed a synergistic cytotoxicity on myeloma cells with high pMARCKS expressions. To further elucidate the role of p MARCKS in drug resistance, we knocked down p MARCKS expression by transfecting siMARCKS into 8226 R5 and MM.1R cells. Following the knockdown, both cell lines had significantly lower viability after treatment with either bortezomib, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, or lenolidomide, in comparison to empty vector controls. FACS analysis and annexin V assay of the knockdown cells and the control cells from both cell lines showed significantly induction of G1/S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the knockdown cells. The immunoprecipitation (IP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) DNA-qPCR analysis further demonstrated that p MARCKS regulates SKP2 expression through binding with E2F1, mediating SKP2/p27 Kip1 cell cycle pathway. Finally, we investigated the effect of inhibition of p MARCKS in a 8226 R5 xenograft model of SCID mice. Mice injected with shMARCKS-transfected 8226 R5 cells and received bortezomib showed significant retardation of tumor growth and prolonged survival compared to the control groups. Taken together, our data indicate that pMARCKS is constitutively activated in resistant and relapsed MM cells and contributes to drug resistance by regulating E2F1 mediated SKP2/p27 Kip1 cell cycle pathway, thus providing a preclinical rationale for targeting p MARCKS as a promising approach in patients with refractory/relapsed MM.
