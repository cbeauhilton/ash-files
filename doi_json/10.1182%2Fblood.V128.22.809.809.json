    "abstract_text": "Allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is an established therapy for the treatment of malignant diseases such as leukemia or lymphoma. Unfortunately, this often leads to an immunological complication, termed graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), in which donor T cells attack host tissues. Patients with acute GvHD can be efficiently treated with immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin A and tacrolimus. These agents inhibit the phosphatase calcineurin, which leads to suppression of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). However, inhibition of calcineurin causes severe side effects and impairs the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect. Therefore, we evaluate new therapeutic options. Previously, we have demonstrated that posttranslational modification of NFATc1 by SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier) modulates its transcriptional activity in vitro (Nayak et al. 2009. J Biol Chem 284:10935-46). To elucidate the importance of NFATc1 SUMOylation in vivo , we generated an NFAT mutant mouse with lysine to arginine exchanges within the C-terminal SUMOylation motifs, Nfatc1 K702/914R , encoding NFATc1 \u0394 Sumo . NFATc1 \u0394 Sumo mice were healthy and developed a normal lymphoid compartment. In line with our former in vitro studies, however, NFATc1 \u0394 Sumo CD4 + T cells produced more IL-2 and less effector lymphokines like IFN-\u03b3 when challenged ex vivo . Since enhanced IL-2 levels can protect from GvHD, we compared NFATc1 \u0394 Sumo vs WT T cells in an murine MHC major mismatch allo-HSCT model (C57BL/6, H-2 b into BALB/c, H-2 d ), leading to acute GvHD. For noninvasive bioluminescence imaging of transplanted T cells, we crossed NFATc1 \u0394 Sumo mice with firefly luciferase-expressing mice. Recipients of NFATc1 \u0394 Sumo T cells survived much longer than WT T-cell recipients, correlating with a significant reduction of in vivo expansion and GvHD target organ infiltration. Surface expression of \u03b14\u03b27-integrin, which guides T cells into the intestine, was slightly decreased on CD4 + T cells of NFATc1 \u0394 Sumo mice. Accordingly, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed reduced NFATc1 SUMOylation-deficient CD4 + T cells infiltrating the gastrointestinal tract. Importantly, intracellular TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 levels were significantly decreased in alloreactive NFATc1 \u0394 Sumo T cells. In contrast, CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + regulatory T (Treg) cells increased in mice with transplanted NFATc1 \u0394 Sumo T cells. To evaluate whether higher IL-2 production from conventional T cells (Tcons) would enhance Treg frequency, we transplanted NFATc1 \u0394 Sumo or WT Tcons, always in combination with WT Tregs to suppress GvHD in vivo . Indeed, WT Tregs frequencies were 2-fold higher in the presence of Tcons from NFATc1 \u0394 Sumo mice as compared to WT Tcons. Consequently, expansion of NFATc1 \u0394 Sumo alloreactive Tcons was inhibited. Accordingly, an in vitro suppression assay demonstrated that NFATc1 \u0394 Sumo regulatory T cells (Tregs) exhibit similar suppressive capacities as WT Tregs and, thus, may mainly benefit from the beneficial condition provided by NFAT1 \u0394 Sumo Tcons. Conclusively, NFATc1 SUMOylation in T cells is critical for balancing inflammation and tolerance by regulating the ratio of Tcons vs Tregs. We postulate that averted NFATc1 SUMOylation ameliorates inflammatory diseases due to higher IL-2 production, which supports Treg proliferation. Blocking NFATc1 SUMOylation in T cells before allo-HSCT poses a potential therapeutic option similar to IL-2 treatment against GvHD. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
