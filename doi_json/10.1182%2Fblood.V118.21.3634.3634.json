    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3634 PARP is activated in response to DNA single strand (SS) breaks and is pivotal to the base excisional repair pathway for chemotherapy-damaged DNA. The orally bioavailable PARP inhibitor V delays DNA repair and potentiates the cytotoxicity of multiple classes of chemotherapy drugs including topoisomerase I inhibitors and platinating agents in leukemia cell lines. A previous clinical trial of T+C yielded promising results in adults with refractory acute leukemia at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of T 1.6 mg/m 2 /d + C 150 mg/m 2 /d by intravenous continuous infusion (IVCI) \u00d7 120 hrs. We are conducting a Phase I dose-escalation trial of V given orally twice daily Days 1\u20138 with T+C given by 120 hr IVCI Days 3\u20137. Deaths due to myocardial infarct and splenic infarcts with ascites occurred in one pt each when C 150 mg/m 2 was added to V 10 mg BID and T 1.3 mg/m 2 , resulting in adjustment of the dose escalation schema for C and T.

Overall response rate is 27% (8CR, 4 CRi, 3 PR), with 7 in relapsed AML, 7 in refractory AML and 1 refractory ALL. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in pt plasma, marrow supernatant, and marrow blasts demonstrated that V is detectable in marrow supernatant and cells, does not accumulate with multiple dose administrations in plasma but does in marrow, and is not altered by T or C administration. Nuclear staining for phosphorylated histone H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) demonstrated that V 10 mg BID increased DNA damage by > 2-fold in 11/22 (50%) on Day 1 and 13/18 (72 %) on Day 4 after 24 hrs of T+C. A PAR ELISA demonstrated that V suppresses PAR levels to <50% of pretreatment values in 30/41 (73%) blood and 3/4 patients at V 40mg per day dose level had greater than 80% suppression of PAR. The MTD has not been reached and dose escalation is ongoing. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
