    "abstract_text": "IL-21, a member of the IL-2 cytokine family, is reported to have an immune-mediated anti-tumor activity against renal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma and Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (NHL) cell lines in xenograph animal models. Whether IL-21 exhibits direct anti-tumor activity against NHL cell lines and primary tumors is presently unknown. We analyzed seven DLBCL and two Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma cell lines for IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) expression. IL-21R was expressed at high levels in the two Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma cell lines (RAJI and RAMOS). Out of the seven DLBCL lines, four expressed high levels of the receptor (OCI-LY-3, OCI-LY-7, OCI-LY-19, and RCK-8) while three had low receptor expression levels (OCI-LY-10, SU-DHL-4, and SU-DHL-6). IL-21 stimulation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1, -3, and -5 as early as fifteen minutes post treatment in DLBCL lines expressing either high (OCI-LY-3 and RCK-8) or low (SU-DHL-6 and OCI-LY-10) levels of IL-21R. In six of the seven DLBCL lines tested, IL-21 dramatically inhibited or completely abolished cellular proliferation at 25 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL concentrations, respectively. In contrast, one DLBCL cell line (OCI-LY-3) exhibited a threefold increase in cellular proliferation after stimulation with 25 ng/mL IL-21, but proliferation was effectively inhibited by 100 ng/mL IL-21. Marked apoptosis and cell death were observed by flow cytometry at 72 hours post IL-21 exposure in all nine NHL cell lines tested with the exception of OCI-LY-3 which exhibited no significant change in cell viability. The IL-21-induced apoptosis was associated with an activation of caspases 3/7, 8, and 9, detected as early as 12 hours post IL-21 exposure. IL-21 also induced an increase in the levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim in all the cell lines exhibiting marked apoptosis. In contrast, Bim protein levels decreased in response to the IL-21 stimulation in the resistant OCI-LY-3 DLBCL cell line. IL-21 treatment led to a decrease in the protein levels of Bcl-2 in all the analyzed cell lines except OCI-LY-3. An increase in expression of Bcl-6 protein in three of the four tested DLBCL cell lines was observed in response to IL-21 exposure. In primary tumors, IL-21 induced apoptosis in two of two DLBCLs, two of three follicular lymphomas, and two of six chronic lymphocytic leukemias. No apoptosis or cell death was induced in normal peripheral B-lymphocytes or in the HeLa or 293T control cells. These results suggest that IL-21 exhibits a direct anti-tumor effect on the DLBCL cell lines and primary tumors and point to a potential applicability of IL-21 in anti-DLBCL therapy. Further work interrogating the molecular mechanism of the IL-21-induced apoptosis of DLBCL cells in vitro and in animal models is in progress.",
