    "abstract_text": "In patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), kinase domain mutations account for imatinib resistance in the majority of cases. Mutations cause either a direct steric hindrance to drug binding or a conformational change that favors kinase activation, which therefore precludes imatinib binding. We have previously characterized the dual Src-Abl kinase inhibitor AP23464 and found it to effectively suppress the growth of cells expressing native and essentially all imatinib-resistant variants of BCR-ABL, with the notable exception of the gatekeeper T315I mutant ( Azam et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA , 103 : 9244 , 2006 ). Following this work, we have used mutant panel screening and integrated structural analysis to further characterize key analogs designed to overcome T315I resistance, as exemplified by AP23846 and AP24163. Both molecules effectively inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of wild type (WT) and T315I variants of BCR-ABL, and inhibit the proliferation of BaF3-derived cell lines expressing these enzymes (see Table below). AP24163 was further characterized against a broader panel of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL-expressing cell lines and showed a promising profile of proliferation inhibition. Comparison of these data with structural models of the mutants provides insights into the basis for the ability of AP24163 to overcome imatinib resistance. Refinement of small-molecule kinase inhibitors by the integration of sequential screening of panels of mutants coupled with structural analysis is a powerful drug discovery paradigm that is applicable to an increasing number of targeted therapeutic agents.
