    "abstract_text": "Accelerated osteoclastogenesis is the major event promoting the skeletal impairment in multiple myeloma (MM). Osteoclasts (OC) are directly activated by myeloma cells (MC), although these cells themselves may apparently undergo to OC-like morphologic transformation and produce bone erosion in vitro. Since OCs exert their function and promote osteoclastogenesis through activation of several adhesion molecules, including a v b 3 , we investigated the role of this integrin expressed by MCs in their OC-like activity in vitro. Bone marrow MCs were purified from eight patients with severe skeletal disease (group A) and from two patients without bone lesions (group B). U266 and RPMI-8226 MC lines were the controls. Semi-nested PCR assessed the CDR3 immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement, whereas OC markers including TRAcP, cathepsin-k, calcitonin-receptor, carbonic anhydrase and vATPase were evaluated by RT-PCR. The cytoskeletal rearrangement of F-actin was analyzed by immunofluorescence. a v and b 3 expression on MCs was evaluated by flow-cytometry, whereas bone erosion on calcium phosphate discs and number of pits was measured by dedicated software. The effect of a v b 3 stimulation on the activation of osteoclastogenic function was investigated by exploring the phosphorilation of transcriptional kinases and downstream molecules, as ERK1/2 and cFos, respectively. The primary role of a v b 3 in OC-like functional transdifferentiation was explored in MCs by siRNA silencing for both chains. Ontogenetic derivation from the B-cell lineage was confirmed by the monoclonal CDR3 rearrangement, CD138/CD38 and Pax-5 expression. Cells from patients of group A expressed OC markers, in contrast with those of group B or U266 and RPMI-8226. Formation of the F-actin ring confirmed the differentiation of MCs toward the OC-like phenotype. Cells from group A expressed a v and b 3 (80\u00b17% and 75\u00b19%) similarly to U266 and RPMI-8226 (>90% in both instances), whereas a minimal expression was demonstrated in group B (a v :6\u00b12%; b 3 :8\u00b13%). a v b 3 + cells produced a high number of erosive pits, at variance from a v b 3 \u2212 cells (35\u00b18 vs. 4\u00b11 pits/cm 2 ). The highest phosphorilation of ERK1/2 and expression of cFos was revealed in patients of group A as compared to B (840\u00b1110 OD and 905\u00b1210 OD vs. 270\u00b135 OD and 315\u00b180 OD, p<0.0001 in both instances). Finally, the silencing of a v and/or b 3 chain inhibited the erosion by a v b 3 + cells, resulting in a reduced number of pits (7\u00b12 pits/cm 2 ) similar to the pattern obtained with a v b 3 \u2212 cells. Similarly, an inhibition of both ERK1/2 and cFos was demonstrated in silenced cells from group A with values similar to those of group B. Since a v b 3 drives both adhesion of Ocs to extracellular matrix and activation of osteoclastogenesis, it is conceivable that a v b 3 + MCs may functionally transdifferentiate to OCs in response to integrin activation induced by the contact with stromal cells within the marrow environment, thus resulting in a typical OC-like behaviour. In addition, our data suggest that MCs induce this effect by a v b 3 , since its silencing reduces the OC-like activity in vitro.",
