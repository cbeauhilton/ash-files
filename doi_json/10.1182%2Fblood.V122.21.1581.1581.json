    "abstract_text": "Introduction Patients with masked polycythemia vera (mPV) present with hemoglobin (HB) values borderline inferior to those required by the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria (HB >16.5g% and >18.5 g% in female and male respectively) but are suspected to have PV for presenting clinico-hematological features. The diagnostic HB values required by the WHO guidelines have been considered surrogate of increased red cell mass (RCM). However, in both males and females HB values are not always equal to an absolute erythrocytosis and conversely a HB concentration below the required cut off level could be associated with an increased red cell mass. We believe that bone marrow (BM) morphology may play an important role in differentiating PV from other MPN entities and reactive changes. In this study we investigated JAK2V617/Exon12-positive patients showing BM features characteristic for PV and classified as mPV or overt PV according to their hemoglobin levels and evaluated their respective outcomes including thrombosis, progression to myelofibrosis (MF), acute leukemia (AL) and overall survival with the purpose to support the diagnosis of PV also in patients presenting with lower HB levels than required by WHO criteria. Materials and Methods A clinicopathological database of patients who were diagnosed and treated for PV was created by clinicians and hematopathologists from seven international centers of excellence for MPNs. Eligibility criteria for entry included the presence of JAK2V617F (or Exon12) mutation, EPO measurement, no evidence of subnormal ferritin levels and the availability of representative, treatment-naive BM biopsies (hematoxylin-eosin staining and silver impregnation after Gomori or Gordon-Sweet). All BM biopsies were centrally re-reviewed by one of the authors (J.T.) who was completely blinded to outcome data. In both mPV and overt PV patients, phlebotomy and cytoreductive therapy were used with the same frequency (p=0.101). Results and Discussion Among 397 mutated patients, with PV BM morphology as defined by WHO, 257 (65%) met the full WHO-2008 criteria. The remaining 140 patients (35%) were classified as mPV for levels of HB at diagnosis, ranging from 16.5 to 18.5 g/dL in men and from 15.0 to 16.5 g/dL in women, and frequent presence of subnormal EPO levels (65%). At baseline, mPV patients were more males, had more previous arterial thrombosis and presented more frequently with platelet counts exceeding the required level of WHO-defined ET (450 x 10 9 /L), often mimicking clinically this entity at onset. After a median follow-up of 3.8 (0-29.8) and 4.5 (0-21.1) years in mPV and overt PV, respectively, time to the first thrombotic event was superimposable in the two groups while time to progression to MF and AL was significantly different .These combined events were recorded in 10% of mPV and 5.8% of overt PV, corresponding to an annual rate of 1.60 % pts/year in mPV and 0.97 % pts/year in overt PV, respectively (p=0.010). In addition, an inferior overall survival was documented in mPV patients in comparison with overt PV (p=0.011). The annual rate of death in mPV was almost twice that of overt PV, mainly due to an excess of hematological transformation (overt MF and AL). Multivariable analysis identified age older than 65 years (hazard ratio (HR) 6.63, P10 x10 9 /L (HR 2.99, P=.005) and diagnosis of mPV (HR 2.38, P=.036) as independent risk factors for survival in these patients. These results show that in JAK2 mutated patients with borderline HB levels, BM features may be a valid support to confirm the suspicion of PV diagnosis. Of interest, recent data demonstrated that all patients with increased RCM also had BM morphology typical of PV. It is tempting to speculate that the clinico-hematologic phenotype of mPV may represent an early stage of a JAK2 mutated MPN, presenting as a variant of PV, with a more rapid progression to MF and AL. The recognition of these early PV patients has an important clinical impact since, in spite of not meeting the full WHO criteria, mPV share the same vascular risk as overt PV. In conclusion, these data suggest that mPV is not necessarily only an early form of classical PV but a distinct entity with disease outcomes akin to primary myelofibrosis.
