    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2168 Poster Board II-145 The deregulated tyrosine kinase associated with t(9;22) fusion protein BCR-ABL is efficiently targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Imatinib, Nilotinib and Dasatinib). It is generally believed that most patients have residual disease. The inability to eliminate the refractory leukemia stem cell in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is not well understood. The refractory stem cell is present despite effective inhibition of the BCR-ABL kinase in these cells, and dissociation between kinase inhibition and cell death implies lack of dependency on BCR-ABL aberrant kinase activity, unlike the one seen in more mature CML cells. Thus the oncogene addictive dependency of these leukemia stem cells may be overcome by intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors/pathways. One such pathway involved in hematopoeitic stem cell maintenance is the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. BCR-ABL signaling is known to directly activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. The loss of function of a negative regulator of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, known as GSK3\u03b2 is associated with CML progression from chronic phase to the blast phase. Lastly, the loss of \u03b2-catenin in murine models impairs the self renewal capacity of both the normal and the BCR-ABL+ leukemia stem cell. Thus this pathway is important during various stages of the disease. We explored the effect of Wnt inhibition using a novel Wnt pathway inhibitor (AG-214, University of Michigan). AG-214 is structurally related to a previously reported Wnt-inhibitor. AG-214 is able to antagonize \u03b2-catenin/TCF in luciferase reporter assays, and expression of Wnt targets in colon cancer cell lines. We utilized a serum free culture system with 5 added cytokines and treated both CML blast crisis CD34+ as well as chronic phase CD34+ cells with AG-214. Our in vitro experiments show that primary blast crisis CD34+ cells are induced to undergo apoptosis at an IC-50 of approximately 2 \u03bcM. Furthermore, combination of 1.25 \u03bcM of AG-214 with 2 \u03bcM Imatinib achieved greater than 50% apoptosis. Analysis of chronic phase CML CD34+ cells showed that targeting of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway requires higher concentration of the Wnt-inhibitor (>2.5 \u03bcM), and that the addition of Imatinib can cooperate to enhance the apoptotic response. Furthermore, chronic phase progenitors (Lin-CD38+/CD34+) are more sensitive to lower concentrations of AG-214 whereas 5 \u03bcM is required to induce significant apoptosis of \u223c70% in the primitive leukemia stem cell (Lin-/CD38-/CD34+) population, and addition of 2 \u03bcM Imatinib increased their apoptotic response to \u223c84%. Normal CD34+ cells do not undergo significant apoptosis with 5 \u03bcM of AG-214 (\u223c10%) even when combined with 2 \u03bcM Imatinib (\u223c20%). Targeting of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway enhances apoptosis in both blast crisis and chronic phase CML progenitors and leukemia stem cells.
