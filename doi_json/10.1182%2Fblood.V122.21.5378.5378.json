    "abstract_text": "Introduction Primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL) is an uncommon, highly aggressive plasma cell dyscrasia with a poor prognosis.\u00a0 A limited number of small retrospective studies have reported promising results in treating PCL using the novel agent bortezomib (btz).\u00a0 We therefore undertook a retrospective study of our cohort of patients (pts)\u00a0with newly diagnosed pPCL treated with cyclophosphamide, btz, and dexamethasone (CyBorD) as front-line therapy. Methods Between August 2008 and June 2013, 10 newly diagnosed pts with pPCL (\u226520% PCs in peripheral blood and/or absolute PCs \u2265 2.0x10 9 /L) were referred to Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.\u00a0 Pts received a median of 4 (range 4-8) 28-day cycles of CyBorD induction consisting of weekly cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 po, weekly btz 1.5 mg/m 2 IV or SQ, and dexamethasone in pulse fashion for cycles 1 and 2 and then weekly as well. Hematologic responses were assessed using IMWG consensus criteria for serological, and, if available, bone marrow, criteria. Survival times were measured from the time of first treatment. Results The median age was 54 yrs (range 45-68); 6 were male. Median (range) hemoglobin was 85 g/L (27-135), creatinine\u00a0212 umol/L (57-404), albumin 37g/L (25-47), LDH 215 U/L (163-537) and \u03b22-microglobulin 441 nmol/L (295-1136); median WBC was 10.6 (4.8-32.2), ANC 2.0 (1.4-3.3), and platelet count\u00a094 (36-159) x 10 9 /L.\u00a0 Abnormal cytogenetics were common; of 9 pts with FISH results available, 4 pts had\u00a0deletion 13q (44.4%), 3 had deletion 17p\u00a0(33.3%),\u00a03 had\u00a0t(14;16) (33.3%), 4 had t(11;14) (44.4%) and 2 had other changes (22.2%).\u00a0 The overall response rate (ORR defined as \u2265 PR) after CyBorD induction was 100% and included\u00a0PR in 3 pts (33.3%),\u00a0VGPR in 5 pts (50%), and CR in 2 pt (20%).\u00a0 Nine pts underwent successful stem cell (SC) mobilization with cyclophosphamide + G-CSF (median CD 34+ cells 3.42 x 10 6 /kg [range 2.16-7.31]); 1 pt, who has been given 8 cycles to date, is awaiting a second attempt at SC collection.\u00a0 Two other patients relapsed after completion of planned induction while awaiting transplant; these required additional therapy to control the disease before ASCT. In total, 9 pts have undergone subsequent ASCT, including tandem ASCT in 4 pts. After ASCT, 1 pt received maintenance therapy with thalidomide, while 6 more recently treated pts were given lenalidomide maintenance. Best responses post-ASCT were as follows: \u2265 PR in all 9 pts (100%, specifically PR in 1 (11.1%), VGPR in 4 (44.4%), and CR in 4 (44.4%, including 1 pt with nonsecretory disease in documented CR pre-ASCT who was not formally reassessed but clinically remained in CR after ASCT).\u00a0 Five patients have relapsed post-ASCT with time to relapse from ASCT of 13.5 mos (range 3-38), including both pts who had progressed and required additional therapy before ASCT (time to relapse 3 and 4 months). The median PFS for all pts from the start of therapy was 18 mos (range 4-44 mos). Currently, 7 pts (70%) are alive after a median follow-up of 25 mos (range 8-58); 5 of these pts are alive without relapse after a median of 25 mos (range 8-28) while 2 pts (20%) are alive after \u2265 1 relapse at a median of 49 mos (range 39-58).\u00a0 Three pts (30%) have died from disease a median of 20 mos (range 7-24) after commencing therapy. During CyBorD induction,\u00a05 pts required hospitalization for a median of 10 days (range 6-53); heme toxicity was generally mild, with only 1\u00a0grade 4 neutropenia and no grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. Other toxicities included: mild peripheral neuropathy in\u00a05 pts (50%) (grade 1 in 4; grade 2 in 1) in addition to grade 1 shingles (10%), grade 2 drug fever attributed to btz (10%), and anemia requiring transfusion (10%). Conclusions Although compromised by the small sample size, our study suggests that induction with CyBorD for pts with pPCL produces a high initial ORR with a favorable toxicity profile.\u00a0 However, disease progression is common in this entity and can occur\u00a0early, while waiting for ASCT; these pts have a particularly poor outcome even after reinduction and subsequent ASCT. Although CyBorD is an effective initial regimen for patients with pPCL, innovative therapies will be needed to maintain long-term disease control.
