    "abstract_text": "Introduction Immunotherapy represents a new weapon in the fight against multiple myeloma. Current clinical outcomes using CAR-T cell therapy against multiple myeloma show promise in the eradication of the disease. However, these CARs observe relapse as a common phenomenon after treatment due to the reemergence of neoantigens or negative cells. CARs can also be targeted using non-antibody approaches, including the use of receptors, as NKG2D with a wider range of ligands, and ligands to provide target specificity. Different cell types have been used to improve CAR cell therapy. CAR-T cells are the most commonly used. However, despite its effectiveness, there are still problems to face. The toxicity of the cytokine release syndrome is well known, that is why memory CD45RA - T cells are used to avoid collateral effects, although having lower efficacy. However, CAR-NK cells may have less toxicity and provide a method to redirect these cells specifically to refractory cancer. The objective of this work was to compare the anti-tumor activity of CAR-T, NKAEs and CAR-NK cells from multiple myeloma patients. Methods The activated and expanded NK cells (NKAE) were generated by coculture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the previously irradiated CSTX002 cell line. The CD45RA - T cells were obtained by depletion with CD45RA magnetic beads and subsequent culture. The NKAE and T were transduced with an NKG2D-CAR with signaling domains of 4-1BB and CD3z. The expansion of NKAE and the expression of NKG2D-CAR were evaluated by flow cytometry based on the percentage of NK cell population and transduction efficiency by the expression of NKG2D. Europium-TDA release assays (2-4 hours) were performed to evaluate in vitro cytotoxic activity. The antitumor activity of the NKAE (n=4) and CD45RA- (n=4) cells against MM U-266 cells was studied. Methylcellulose cultures were performed to assess the activity against the clonogenic tumor cell. In vivo studies were carried out in NSG mice receiving 5.10 6 of U266-luc MM cells i.v. injected at day 1. At day 4, mice received 15.10 6 i.v. injected of either CAR-NKAE or untransduced NKAE cells. Results In vitro. The killing activity of primary NKAE cells (n=4) was 86.6% (\u00b1 13.9%), considerably higher than that of CD45RA - lymphocytes (16.7% \u00b1 13.6%) from the same patient (n=4). Even CD45RA - T cells from healthy donors (n=4) exhibit lower anti tumoral capacity (28.2% \u00b1 9.7%) than NKAE cells. The transduction with an NKG2D CAR (MOI=5) improved the activity of autologous NKAE cells by 10% (96.4% \u00b1 19%) leading to a nearly complete destruction of U-266 MM cells, and that of CD45RA- allogenic healthy cells in 19% (47.4% \u00b1 12.6%). Nevertheless, CD45RA - autologous T cells transduced with NKG2D-CAR minimally improved their activity by 5.8% (22.5% \u00b1 10.6%). Additionally, the CAR-NKAE cells were able to destroy the clonogenic tumor cell responsible for the progression of the MM from RPMI-8226 cell line. At an 8:1 ratio the CAR-NKAE cells were able to destroy 71.2% \u00b1 2.5% of the clonogenic tumor cells, while the NKAE reached 56.5% \u00b1 2.6% at a maximum ratio of 32: 1. The toxicity of the CAR-NKAE cells on healthy tissue from the same patient was assessed, and no activity against autologous PBMCs was observed, 1,8% at a maximun ratio of 32:1 (effector:target). In vivo . NKAE cells and CAR-NKAE cells were efficient in abrogating MM growth. However, CAR-NKAE cells treatment showed higher efficiency 14 days after tumor cells injection. Forty-two days after tumor cells injection, only animals receiving CAR-NKAE cells treatment remain free of disease (Figure 1). Conclusions It is feasible to modify primary NKAE cells and CD45RA - T cells from primary MM cells to safely express an NKG2D-CAR. Our data show that CD45RA - T cells from patients are not effective in vitro against MM even once transduced with our CAR. The resulting CAR-NKG2D NKAE cells are the most appropriate strategy for the destruction of MM in vitro and in vivo in our model. These results form the basis for the development of an NKG2D-CAR NK cell therapy in MM.
