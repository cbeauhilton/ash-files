    "abstract_text": "Activating mutations in the NOTCH1 gene have been found in about 60% of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In order to study the molecular mechanisms by which altered Notch signaling induces leukemia, a zebrafish model of NOTCH1-induced T-cell leukemia was generated using TAN-1, the NOTCH1 oncogene generated by the t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) chromosome translocation associated with human T-ALL. Seven of sixteen mosaic fish developed a T cell lymphoproliferative disease at about 5 months. These neoplastic cells extensively invaded tissues throughout the fish and caused an aggressive and lethal leukemia when transplanted into irradiated recipient fish. A stable transgenic fish line was then generated, which also develops leukemia, but with a longer latency for leukemia onset. This longer latency allowed crosses to be done to evaluate potential genetic interactions between NOTCH1 and other T-ALL oncogenes. Interestingly, LMO2 did not cooperate with NOTCH1 to induce T-ALL, while bcl2 had dramatic effects on latency and progression of T-ALL in this zebrafish model. These results suggest that the transforming functions of NOTCH1 and LMO2 may be redundant, while the functions of NOTCH1 and bcl2 are highly complementary. The ability of this model to detect a strong interaction between NOTCH1 and bcl2 suggests that genetic modifier screens have a high likelihood of revealing other genes that can cooperate with NOTCH1 to induce T-ALL."
