    "abstract_text": "Background: A first report of the PETHEMA LPA99 trial in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) showed that a risk-adapted treatment strategy combining ATRA and anthracycline alone for induction and consolidation results in high antileukemic efficacy and low toxicity. We report here an updated analysis of this trial including a significantly higher number of patients and longer follow-up. Methods: From November 1999 to July 2005, 564 patients (median age 40 years, range 2\u201383) with APL received induction with ATRA (45 mg/m2/d) until CR and idarubicin (12 mg/m 2 /d) on days 2, 4, 6 and 8. Patients in CR received 3 monthly courses of risk-adapted consolidation therapy as follows: \u201clow-risk\u201d patients (WBC <10\u00d710 9 /l and platelets >40\u00d710 9 /l), idarubicin 5 mg/m 2 /d \u00d7 4 (course #1), mitoxantrone 10 mg/m 2 /d \u00d7 5 (course #2), and idarubicin 12 mg/m 2 /d \u00d7 1 (course #3); \u201cintermediate-risk \u201c (WBC <10\u00d710 9 /l and platelet <40\u00d710 9 /l) and \u201chigh-risk\u201d (WBC >10\u00d710 9 /l) patients received ATRA (45 mg/m 2 /d \u00d7 15) in combination with reinforced chemotherapy (Idarubicin 7 mg/m 2 /d in the course #1 and two days instead of one in the course #3). Maintenance therapy consisted of 50 mg/m 2 /d mercaptopurine orally, 15 mg/m 2 /week methotrexate intramuscularly, and 45 mg/m2/d ATRA for 15 days every 3 months. Results: CR was achieved in 511 patients (91%). Except for three cases labelled as resistant, of the remaining 50 patients 56%, 24%, 16% and 4% died due to hemorrhage, infection, retinoic acid syndrome, and acute myocardial infarction, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that WBC >10\u00d710 9 /l, age >60 years, male gender, and serum creatinine >1.4 mg/dl at presentation had independent predictive value of death during induction. The median follow-up of the cohort was 57 months (range 20\u201394 months). Thirteen patients (median age 72 years, range 4\u201381) died in remission and 99% of patients completed the entire assigned therapy. Thirty-six patients presented haematological relapse, 16 molecular relapse, and 8 secondary myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Overall, the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), disease-free survival, and overall survival were 11%, 85%, and 84%, respectively. The 5-year CIR for low-, intermediate- and high-risk patients were 4%, 7% and 28%, respectively. Conclusions: A risk-adapted strategy combining ATRA and anthracycline monochemotherapy for induction and consolidation therapy results in high antileukemic efficacy, low toxicity and a high degree of compliance in newly diagnosed APL.",
