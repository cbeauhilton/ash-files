Additionally we have demonstrated that hypocholesterolemia in MPN patients is associated with decreased survival (Blood 2007;110:a2548). Given that current JAK2 inhibitor trials are demonstrating the ability to reverse MPN associated splenomegaly (Haematologica 2009;94(Suppl 2)439 a1088) and cachexia (Blood 2008;112(11):a1760) we sought to determine the baseline natural history for these variables in patients treated prior to the JAK2 inhibitor era. METHODS We analyzed the Mayo MPN database for patients (not treated with JAK2 inhibitors) with information on disease prognosis, presentation, therapies, height and weight at diagnosis, and outcomes. Additionally, when available, we analyzed additional weights during the clinical course, the body mass index (BMI- (weight/(height*height)), spleen size, and peripheral blood studies including lipids. Results: Patients 783 patients with MPNs (followed for a median of 51 months (range 1-871 months); 60% having expired) were identified for the analysis (PV=158, ET=255, PMF=370) with 541 (69%) having a weight at the time of diagnosis, the remainder had a weight obtained a median of 7.8 months after diagnosis. Additionally, 508 patients (65%) had a weight value available from 1\u20133 additional time points during the course of their disease. Corresponding measurements of splenomegaly, or absence thereof, were noted in 766 cases (98%). Lipid panels (obtained within 18 months of diagnosis) were available in 264 patients. Results by MPN disease type are listed in the Table. Table Serial changes in weight, splenomegaly and cholesterol in 783 MPN Patients  . PV(N=158) . ET(N=255) . PMF(N=370) . P = .

The IWG-MRT International Prognostic Score (IPSS - Cervantes et. al. Blood 2009) was the only variable prognostically relevant in multivariate analysis (P<0.001). Conclusions Progressive splenomegaly, weight loss, and hypocholesterolemia are common across all MPNs but are most prognostically detrimental in PMF. Ongoing and future trials of JAK2 inhibitors will answer whether reversal of these latter hypercatabolic and proliferative manifestations of disease will improve outcomes for MPN patients.
