    "abstract_text": "Melphalan-Prednisone + bortezomib (MPV) is one of the standard of care for the frontline treatment of patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma non eligible for high-dose therapy. In the pivotal VISTA trial for approval of MPV, the main toxicity was grade 3-4 peripheral neuropathy (PN) described in 14% of the cases. Carfilzomib (CFZ), the second-in-class proteasome inhibitor has shown promising activity and a favorable toxicity profile with low PN rates. Therefore, the option of combining CFZ with MP (CMP) is an attractive one. Therefore we designed a phase I/II study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CMP and to assess safety and efficacy. In the phase I portion of the trial, CFZ was started at 20mg/m 2 , then escalated to 27, 36, and 45mg/m 2 , administered IV over 30 minutes in 42-day cycles on D1/2/8/9/22/23/29/30 for 9 cycles. Melphalan 9mg/m 2 and prednisone 60mg/m 2 were given PO D1\u20134 of every 42-day cycle. MTD was based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in cycle 1 defined as any grade 4 (G4) hematologic adverse event (AE), any hematologic AE preventing aministration of \u2265 2 CFZ doses except G4 thrombocytopenia without bleeding or G4 neutropenia \u2264 7days, \u2265 G3 febrile neutropenia, or any \u2265G3 nonhematologic AE. As of July 6, 2013, 24 pts have been enrolled in phase I: 6 for each dose level. There were 2 DLTs at 45mg/m 2 (fever plus hypotension) resulting in a MTD of 36mg/m 2 . In Phase II, 44 additional patients received CMP at 36mg/m 2 CFZ for N=68 total PhI/II patients (50 patients overall treated at the dose pf 36mg/m 2 ). The median age of the series was 72 years, with 36% of the patients presenting with ISS3. Overall response rate was 89.5% including 56% \u2265 very good partial response. With a median follow-up of 12 months, the projected 2y OS was 87%, and the median event-free survival was 22 months. CMP was well tolerated and only 1 patient developed grade 3 PN. These promising results compare favorably to those of MPV, MP+Thalidomide, MP+lenalidomide (R), and R+dex in similar pts. CFZ 36mg/m 2 + MP is tolerable and effective in elderly patients with symptomatic newly diagnosed MM. Treatment is ongoing, 20% of the patients are receiving their last cycles of CMP. Final safety and efficacy data will be presented during the meeting. Disclosures: Moreau: CELGENE: Honoraria, Speakers Bureau; JANSSEN: Honoraria, Speakers Bureau.
