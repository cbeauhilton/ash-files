    "abstract_text": "Abstract 84 New therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to improve clinical outcomes for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is an extremely aggressive disease with very few long-term survivors. The sirtuin deacetylases (SIRTs) are critical regulators of genes that are essential for longevity, cell growth, tumor suppression, and apoptosis. Elevated SIRT expression has been reported in several types of cancer and may promote pathogenesis and drug resistance by increasing the lifespan and survival capacity of malignant cells. Our preliminary analysis of SIRT expression indicated that SIRT1 was consistently expressed at significantly higher levels in AML cell lines and primary AML blasts as compared with normal controls. In order to investigate the potential role of SIRT1 as a regulator of AML pathogenesis, we utilized shRNA to stably knockdown its expression in MV4-11 and KG-1 AML cells. Cells with targeted SIRT1 knockdown displayed an altered gene expression profile as compared with non-targeted controls. Moreover, antagonizing SIRT1 expression significantly impeded the progression of AML in a xenograft mouse model. A number of deacetylase inhibitors have been clinically evaluated for cancer therapy. However, disrupting SIRT function as an anticancer strategy remains to be rigorously investigated as none of these previously studied drugs significantly inhibit the activity of this class of NAD+-dependent deacteylases. Tenovin-6 is a novel small molecule SIRT inhibitor. We investigated the efficacy and pharmacodynamic effects of tenovin-6 in AML cell lines, primary blasts from patients with AML, and mouse models. Treatment with tenovin-6 induced apoptosis and dramatically diminished AML clonogenic survival. Tenovin-6 promoted a dose-dependent increase in the acetylated levels of the SIRT-regulated gene p53 in AML cells and triggered the induction of several p53 transcriptional targets including p21 and PUMA. Targeted knockdown of PUMA with shRNA significantly reduced the pro-apoptotic effects of tenovin-6, indicating that it is a critical mediator of its anti-leukemic activity. Notably, administration of tenovin-6 to mice implanted with AML cells was well-tolerated and led to a highly significant reduction in disease burden and increase in overall survival. Our collective findings demonstrate that SIRT1 is a promising novel therapeutic target in AML. Further investigation aimed to elucidate the safety, efficacy, and mechanism of action of tenovin-6 is warranted. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
