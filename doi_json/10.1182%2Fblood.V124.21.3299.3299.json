    "abstract_text": "The B cell receptor (BCR) is critical for survival and proliferation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and is activated following antigen/autoantigen engagement. BCR engagement in vivo triggers a partial receptor down modulation, phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in CD79A and CD79B, signalosome formation and subsequent calcium mobilization and ERK phosphorylation (ERK-P). Interestingly CLL cells incubated in vitro recover surface(s)IgM receptor expression and subsequently their ability to signal (calcium flux and ERK-P). During this recovery of sIgM, expression of a fully glycosylated \u201cmature\u201d form of sIgM increases. Interestingly, sIgD is not downregulated in vivo and expression does not increase in vitro . Downregulation by antigen engagement therefore appears only to affect sIgM. IL-4 appears to be present in CLL tissue sites and has a known role in protecting CLL cells from apoptosis however its effect on BCR expression and subsequent downstream signalling has not previously been demonstrated. Therefore we investigated the effects of IL-4 on BCR signalling and on the expression of surface receptors including chemokine receptors CXCR4 and MHC-class II (MHCII). CLL cells were pretreated with and without IL-4 for 24h and sIgM and sIgD expression measured by flow cytometry. sIgM naturally recovers with time and this is significantly enhanced further by IL-4 (p=0.006, n=33), whereas sIgD does not (p=0.48, n=30). The same CLL samples pre-treated with IL-4 for 24 hours followed by treatment with anti-IgM (n=22) for 15 minutes showed enhanced calcium flux in 77% (p=0.0005) of samples compared to the control. The increase in sIgM expression correlated strongly with the ability to induce calcium mobilization in IL-4 treated samples (p=0.0007, r=0.7). The fold increase in sIgM expression following pre-treatment with IL-4 was significantly greater in U-CLL compared with M-CLL (p=0.012) and in ZAP70+ve samples (p=0.02). However, analysis of IL-4R expression did not show a significant difference between M-CLL and U-CLL samples (p=0.18, n=20). The increase in sIgM expression by IL-4 coincided with an increase in CD79b protein expression (p<0.0001, n=26). Futhermore IL-4 pretreatment significantly augmented expression of the fully glycosylated \u00b5-chain of sIgM on the surface of the CLL cells (p=0.005), as confirmed by resistance to EndoH cleavage, indicating a role of IL-4 in IgM assembly and transport to the cytoplasmic membrane. These IL-4-specific effects were blocked with either a JAK3 or STAT6 inhibitor (Tofacitinib or Axon 1992, respectively) which specifically inhibit IL-4 signalling. We next identified whether the effects observed with IL-4 was limited to sIgM. Interestingly, in contrast to the spontaneous recovery of CXCR4 expression which occurs in vitro and parallels the recovery of sIgM expression, IL-4 significantly inhibited CXCR4 recovery in vitro (p<0.0001, n=21) and prevented migration towards CXCL12 in transwell migration assays (p=0.03, n=6). This indicates that IL-4 is not simply amplifying the natural process of recovery of these receptors but is having a differential effect. For other molecules, a significant increase in MHCII expression in IL-4 pre-treated samples (p=0.0011, n=12) was observed mimicking the changes with sIgM, whilst other negative or positive BCR regulator such as CD5 (p=0.47, n=25) and CD19 (p=0.93, n=20) respectively, remained unchanged. Indicating the effect of IL-4 on receptor expression was receptor dependent. These data suggest a role for IL-4 in augmenting sIgM expression and subsequent downstream signalling, increasing MHCII expression, whilst down modulating chemokine receptors to retain CLL cells within the lymph node. Thus IL-4 may play an important biological role when CLL cells encounter antigen/autoantigen and therefore inhibition of this pathway with JAK3 inhibitors may be a potential clinical target for the treatment of CLL.
