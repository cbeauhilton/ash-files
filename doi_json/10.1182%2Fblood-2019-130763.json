    "abstract_text": "Introduction: We have demonstrated that sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization in low oxygen (O 2 ) is the main driver of sickle cell trait (AS) resistance to P. falciparum malaria. This suggests that homozygous sickle cell disease (SS) individuals should have even greater resistance to malaria. Instead SS individuals infected by P. falciparum often have increased malaria morbidity and mortality compared to individuals with normal hemoglobin (AA) or AS. The reasons for this paradox are poorly understood. We propose that fetal hemoglobin (HbF) inhibits polymerization thereby allowing parasite proliferation. To test this hypothesis the following experiments were performed. Methods: AA and SS erythrocytes were collected within two weeks of the assay date. P. falciparum 3D7 parasites were used for growth assays. Growth assays were performed at 1, 3, 5, 7.5, 10 and 16% O 2 using synchronized schizonts obtained by magnet purification via the MACS system. Staging was performed via light microscopy analysis of May-Gr\u00fcnwald-Giemsa-stained cytospins. Parasite Multiplication Rate (PMR) was determined via flow cytometry using parasitemia at 64 and 16 hours post infection (hpi) as previously described. Results: In contrast to AS erythrocytes, SS RBCs contain varying amounts of HbF that differ by cell and by individual. In hypoxic SS RBCs with low (3.8%) HbF, P. falciparum parasites remain immature (early trophozoites) in 1, 3, and 5% O 2 (Fig. 1) at 36 hpi, when they should have matured into schizonts. However, in SS RBCs with high (22.6%) HbF, 12, 16 and 27% of parasites matured into schizonts in 1, 3 and 5% O 2 respectively compared to 0, 0, and 1% in the SS RBCs with 3.8% HbF. Preliminary data also demonstrate that the parasite multiplication rate (PMR), a surrogate of proliferation, in SS RBCs improves with increasing O 2 and HbF. Using SS/Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin RBCs with 42% HbF, proliferation in 5% O 2 or higher is exponential with a PMR of 2.6 or greater (Fig. 2). In RBCs isolated from SS patients treated with hydroxyurea with HbF of 26.4 or 21%, PMR is 2 or more in 7.5% O 2 or greater. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that HbF promotes P. falciparum growth in SS erythrocytes. In addition, the data initiates a resolution of the malaria paradox. HbS in both hypoxic AS and SS surely inhibits P. falciparum growth due to HbS polymerization at low O 2 . But high levels of anti-sickling HbF observed in erythrocytes from many individuals with SS reverses this inhibition despite the increased content of HbS in SS individuals. Even small increases in P. falciparum proliferation within the broadly compromised SS host may enhance the malaria associated morbidity and mortality seen in this population. These data further suggest the importance of anti-malarial prophylaxis in patients with SS especially those treated with hydroxyurea or anti-sickling agents.
