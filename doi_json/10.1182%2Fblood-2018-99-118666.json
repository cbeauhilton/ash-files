    "abstract_text": "Background: The black fly, Simulium Vittatum , has an anticoagulant protein in its saliva that allows it to feed on mammalian blood (black fly protease inhibitor; BFPI). Remarkably, BFPI is similar to the human anticoagulant tissue factor pathway inhibitor alpha (TFPI\u03b1). TFPI\u03b1 contains three Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domains (K1, K2, K3), which inhibit factor VIIa (FVIIa) and factor Xa (FXa) and bind the co-factor protein S (PS), respectively; BFPI contains a single Kunitz domain that inhibits FXa. In addition, TFPI\u03b1 and BFPI contain homologous basic regions (BRs) near their C-termini ( 252 LIKTKRKRKK 261 in human TFPI\u03b1, LIKTRKRKPKK in BFPI). The TFPI\u03b1 BR binds a regulatory acidic region (AR) in factor Va (FVa). The AR is present in forms of FVa released by collagen-activated platelets and generated through limited proteolysis by FXa (FVa Xa ), and is removed by thrombin (FVa IIa ). We hypothesized that BFPI, through its Kunitz domain and basic C-terminus, inhibits early forms of the prothrombinase complex, but does not possess the other inhibitory functions of TFPI\u03b1: (1) K1-dependent inhibition of the tissue factor (TF)-FVIIa complex; and (2) PS/K3-dependent FXa inhibition. Results: Recombinant BFPI inhibited FXa in an amidolytic activity assay, and PS did not promote this inhibition. BFPI did not inhibit TF-FVIIa-mediated FX activation. As described with TFPI\u03b1, FV promoted FXa inhibition by BFPI but FVa IIa did not, suggesting that the BFPI BR is capable of binding the FVa AR. In a purified protein assay, BFPI inhibited prothrombinase assembled with FVa Xa (IC50=4.9nM), but not FVa IIa . Similarly, 5nM BFPI increased the lag time for FXa-initiated plasma thrombin generation by 10.4\u00b11.5%. We next used BFPI as a backbone to evaluate a reported human mutation in the TFPI\u03b1 BR, K254E. Every mammalian, avian, or reptilian TFPI\u03b1 sequence available contains either a Lys or Arg residue at this position, suggesting that this residue is functionally important. In purified protein assays, BFPI-K254E inhibited FXa amidolytic activity identically to BFPI, but FV did not promote this inhibition, suggesting that BFPI-K254E has a specific defect in its interaction with FV. Consistent with this, BFPI-K254E was a weaker inhibitor of prothrombinase assembled with FVa Xa (IC50 = 15.8nM) and FXa-initiated plasma thrombin generation. The results obtained with BFPI-K254E were confirmed using peptides and full-length TFPI\u03b1 proteins. First, a peptide mimicking the wild type TFPI\u03b1 BR (LIKTKRKRKK) inhibited prothrombinase assembled with FVa Xa (IC50 = 1.0 \u00b5M), while the substituted peptide (LIETKRKRKK) was substantially weaker (20% inhibition observed with 340 \u00b5M peptide). Second, full-length TFPI\u03b1-K254E was a weaker inhibitor of prothrombinase containing FXa-activated FVa (IC50 = 14.8 nM, vs. 1.8 nM for TFPI\u03b1) and had greatly reduced anticoagulant activity in plasma-based thrombin generation assays. Conclusions: In summary, the anticoagulant effect of BFPI is mediated through inhibition of early forms of prothrombinase, independent of TF-FVIIa inhibition or PS-dependent FXa inhibition. The natural mutation TFPI\u03b1 K254E disrupts prothrombinase inhibition, despite the presence of six other conserved basic residues, and is thus procoagulant in human plasma. The absolute conservation of the TFPI\u03b1 BR, and its usurpation to allow feeding by black flies, point to formation of the initial prothrombinase complex as a key regulatory step in blood coagulation.
