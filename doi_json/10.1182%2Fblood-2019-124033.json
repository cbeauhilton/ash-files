    "abstract_text": "Background: Relapse remains the main cause of treatment failure post transplantation. Relapse prevention is an important strategy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. M ethods: We retrospectively analyzed the results of21 high risk AML patients who received a median number of 3 courses (range, 2 - 8) of decitabine (DAC) maintenance treatment (20mg/m 2 /d \u00d75d every 3 months for 1 year). Meanwhile, another 63 high risk AML patients without any prophylactic treatment after transplantation were included as a control group for 1:3 pair matched study. Results: With median follow-up of 23 months, 20 out of 21 (95.2%) patients maintained complete molecular remission (CMR) in DAC group, while 35 out of 63 (55.6%) patients maintained CMR in control group. Comparing with control group, the patients of DAC group had higher 3-year overall survival (OS) rates and 3-year leukemia free survival (LFS) rates (92.9% vs 51.8%, P =0.003; 94.1% vs 54.7%, P=0.002 respectively). Moreover, DAC maintenance was well tolerated in all patients and grade 3/4 or 4/4 hematological toxicities were observed in 11 of 21 (52.4%) patients. Conclusion: Our results suggested that DAC maintenance therapy was an effective and safe treatment option to prevent relapse after transplantation for high risk AML patients.
