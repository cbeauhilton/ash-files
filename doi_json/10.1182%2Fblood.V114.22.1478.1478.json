Progenitor cell division and differentiation must be carefully balanced in order to supply the proper numbers and proportions of mature cells. The mechanisms that control the choice between continued cell division and terminal differentiation are incompletely understood. The unstable regulatory protein Geminin is thought to maintain cells in an undifferentiated state while they proliferate. Geminin is a bi-functional protein. It limits the extent of DNA replication to one round per cell cycle by binding and inhibiting the essential replication factor Cdt1. Loss of Geminin leads to replication abnormalities that activate the DNA replication checkpoint and the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway. Geminin also influences patterns of cell differentiation by interacting with Homeobox (Hox) transcription factors and chromatin remodeling proteins. To examine how Geminin affects the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, we created a mouse strain in which Geminin is deleted from the proliferating cells of the bone marrow. Geminin deletion has profound effects on all three hematopoietic lineages. The production of mature erythrocytes and leukocytes is drastically reduced and the animals become anemic and neutropenic. In contrast, the population of megakaryocytes is dramatically expanded and the animals develop thrombocytosis. Interestingly, the number of c-Kit+ Sca1+ Lin- (KSL) stem cells is maintained, at least in the short term. Myeloid colony forming cells are also preserved, but the colonies that grow are smaller. We conclude that Geminin deletion causes a maturation arrest in some lineages and directs cells down some differentiation pathways at the expense of others. We are now testing how Geminin loss affects cell cycle checkpoint pathways, whether Geminin regulates hematopoietic transcription factors, and whether Geminin deficient cells give rise to leukemias or lymphomas.
