We have previously shown the SDF1/CXCR4 axis plays a major role in homing and trafficking of multiple myeloma (MM) to the bone marrow (BM), and disruption of the interaction of tumor cells with the BM leads to enhanced sensitivity to therapeutic agents. We hypothesize that the novel anti-CXCR4 antibody, BMS936564/MDX-1338, may prevent the homing and adhesion of MM cells to the BM and will sensitize them to therapeutic agents. Methods. Primary MM cells (CD138+); MM cell lines (MM.1S, RPMI.8226); and primary MM bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were used. Migration towards SDF-1 and BMSCs has been evaluated. Cytotoxicity and DNA synthesis were measured by MTT and thymidine uptake, respectively. Cell signaling and apoptotic pathways were studied by Western Blot. Synergism was calculated using the Chou-Talalay method. In vivo MM tumor growth was evaluated with xenograft mouse models. Results. MDX-1338 inhibited migration of MM cells toward SDF-1a and primary MM BMSCs, in a dose-dependent manner. Adhesion of primary MM cells to BMSCs was also inhibited by BMS936564/MDX-1338 in a dose-dependent manner, while also inducing cytotoxicity on primary BM-derived CD138+ cells. BMS936564/MDX-1338 targeted MM cells in the context of BM milieu by overcoming BMSC-induced proliferation of tumor cells. In addition, BMS936564/MDX-1338 synergistically enhanced bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity in MM cells. BMS936564/MDX-1338-dependent activation of apoptotic pathways in MM cells was documented, as shown by cleavage of caspase-9 and PARP. SDF-1a-induced ERK-, Akt-, and Src-phosphorilation was inhibited by BMS936564/MDX-1338 in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, BMS936564/MDX-1338 inhibited MM cell proliferation in vivo in xenograft mouse models. Conclusion. These studies therefore show that targeting CXCR-4 in MM by using BMS936564/MDX-1338 represents a valid therapeutic strategy in this disease. Disclosures: Roccaro: Roche: . Kuhne: BMS: Employment.
