    "abstract_text": "Background: MCL is an aggressive and prognostically unfavorable subtype of B-cell NHL, with a 5-yr survival rate <20%. Standard chemotherapy for MCL includes fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxatrone (FCM). Addition of rituximab (R) to FCM increases overall response rate (ORR) from 46% to 58%. Conventional non-myeloablative RIT has been unsuccessful in MCL patients because tumor burdens were large and because of the \u201csink phenomenon.\u201d It was hypothesized that fludarabine sensitizes MCL to the radiotoxic effects of RIT, and RIT applied after appropriate tumor size reduction would consolidate the FCM effect and prolong PFS. The Polish Lymphoma Research Group Trial (PLRG MCL1) assessed whether 90 Y-Zevalin consolidates the response achieved from FCM\u00b1R and provide better ORRs and longer TTP. Methods: Eighteen MCL pts (stage III-IV) not suitable for SCTs were enrolled in 8 PLRG centers: 9 pts had MCL at diagnosis, 6 pts had a PR after 1st-line therapy of MCL, and 3 MCL pts were in 1st relapse. Tumor burden was reduced by treating all pts with a minimum of 3, and a maximum of 6, 3-wk cycles of FCM\u00b1R (375 mg/m 2 ) and staged after the 3rd and subsequent cycles to assess tumor regression. Pts with a CR or PR, 1500/ml, PLTs >100,000/ml, and no BM hypoplasia were in the 90 Y-Zevalin consolidation step. These pts received 250 mg/m 2 of R and 1 wk later a 2nd dose of R+ 90 Y-Zevalin (11 or 15 MBq=0.3 or 0.4 mCi/Kg, based on initial PLT count; max dose=32 mCi). ORR (CR+PR) and hematologic toxicity were determined. Therapeutic response is being monitored at 6 wks, 3 mo, and 3-mo intervals for up to 2 yrs to assess TTP. Another 7 pts have been enrolled; 4 pts will receive 90 Y-Zevalin, but 3 will not due to inadequate response (1) or cytopenias (2) after FCM\u00b1R. Results: Following 90 Y-Zevalin consolidation, 13 of the 15 pts achieved a CR (no palpable lymph nodes or measurable masses on CT scans) and 12 of the 13 shifted from a PR after FCM\u00b1R to a CR. One pt achieved a greater PR after 90 Y-Zevalin. Of these 12 PRa\u0300CR pts, 10 are in CR 3-6 mo after receiving 90 Y-Zevalin, 1 pt progressed at 3 mo, and another progressed immediately despite 90 Y-Zevalin. Response and toxicity data of all pts and preliminary TTP results will be reported at ASH. In most pts, WBC and PLT values \u2193 4\u20135 wks after 90 Y-Zevalin and cytopenias lasted 5\u20137 wks (2 wks longer compared to follicular pts given 90 Y-Zevalin w/o fludarabine; P =NS). In 3 of 15 pts, the time for PMN >1000/ml was 7\u201312 wks and for PLT levels >50,000/ml was >20 wks and were transfusion dependent. No pt developed serious infections. Conclusions: 90 Y-Zevalin consolidated the therapeutic benefit of FCM\u00b1R in 13 MCL pts. Fludarabine, a known radiosensitizer, can reduce tumor burden before RIT and enhance the therapeutic benefit of non-myeloablative doses of 90 Y-Zevalin, but may also \u2191 the toxicity from RIT. Although we have shown 90 Y-Zevalin has negative effects on stem and early progenitor cells, 90 Y-Zevalin can be safely given after fludarabine-based therapy to MCL pts.",
