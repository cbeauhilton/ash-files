    "abstract_text": "Introduction The molecular categorisation of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) has changed the landscape of diagnosis and treatment. Polycythaemia vera (PV) is characterised by red blood cell proliferation and JAK2 V617F or Exon 12 mutations in up to 98% of patients 1 . However, some patients without such mutations have an arduous diagnostic course with varying management and prognostic outcomes 2 . We present our experience in managing this challenging cohort and aim to illuminate a potential diagnostic pathway for patients. Method We searched electronic records of patients attending haematology clinics over the last 20 years at University College Hospital with a prior diagnosis of PV / erythrocytosis (presenting with raised Haemoglobin (Hb) &/ Haematocrit (Hct)) with no evidence of JAK2 exon 12 or 14 mutations on bone marrow or peripheral blood molecular analysis (multiplex PCR sensitivity 0.1%). We reviewed their diagnostic workup, which included full blood count & where available, bone marrow myeloid (Illumina TruSight Myeloid) & erythroid next generation sequencing (NGS) panels. Results 37 patients with JAK2 V617F & Exon 12 mutation negative erythrocytosis were identified. Patients were categorised in to 3 groups 2 ; idiopathic erythrocytosis (IE), secondary polycythaemia (SP) & high affinity haemoglobinopathies (HAH); patient characteristics are summarised in Table 1. The median age of IE & HAH was younger, their presenting Hb/Hct levels was higher compared to SP, with a male predominance. Constitutional symptoms were only reported in the IE cohort. Erythropoietin (EPO) was elevated in HAH & IE patients but within normal range in SP. Thrombotic events occurred in all cohorts, most frequently in IE. Splenomegaly was reported in 4/21 IE, 1/13 SP, but was not a feature in HAH patients. When performed, IE red cell mass (RCM) studies were raised but within normal range in SP patients. Table 2 details IE cohort erythroid mutations. Myeloid NGS only identified MPL and BCOR mutations of pathogenic significance and multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms of no known significance. No abnormalities were demonstrated in 15% of SP patients that underwent bone marrow myeloid mutational analysis. Venesections (VS) were instigated in 95% of the IE cohort, antiplatelets (AP) in 52%, anticoagulation (AC) in 14% and cytoreductive therapy (CT) in 19% due to intolerance/failure of VS. VS programme was instigated in 46% of SP patients, AP in 7% and AC in 47%. Discussion The median age of our IE cohort was 48 yrs with a 19% incidence of thrombosis. Where performed, bone marrow histology demonstrated hypercellularity but was not consistent with MPN diagnostic criteria. Myeloid NGS panel mutations such as BCOR may represent clonal haematopoieis of indeterminate potential. Heterozygous VHL C598T & C376A mutations, in keeping with Chuvash polycythaemia, were demonstrated. Mutations in EGLN1 & BPGM ,were detected in our patients, however there was an absence of correlating haematological parameters or family history to support a diagnosis of congenital erythrocytosis (2) . Variants of unknown significance were also detected in SH2B3 , BMP6 & EGLN3 gene duplication. SP patients were older (median age 68 years) and where performed had normal RCM and no myeloid mutations identified. The initial approach adopted at our centre for diagnosing and managing JAK2 V617F & Exon 12 negative erythocytosis begins with clinical evaluation for secondary causes. This is followed by assessment of EPO level, RCM study, extended molecular mutational analysis involving screening for high affinity haemoglobins, congenital erythrocytosis and bone marrow histology. Where patients are symptomatic or considered at high risk for thrombosis, we venesect to a personalised target and patients are offered AP and/or AC. CT is instigated where VS is not tolerated or ineffective, however this approach is not corroborated in the literature. Our experience highlights the clinical heterogeneity of JAK2 negative erythrocytosis and the need to develop a robust and systematic diagnostic and treatment algorithm with further clarification of the role of molecular profiling. 1.
