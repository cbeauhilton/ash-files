    "abstract_text": "Aim: To explore the role of thalidomide in pre-transplant induction treatment in multiple myeloma. Patients and methods: Between Sept 2002 and March 2005, 37 patients with advanced, de-novo multiple myeloma (mean age 56 years, mean Serum. albumin 33g/L, and median b -2-microglobulin 4.0mg/L) were entered into a multicentre, phase 2 study of pre transplant induction treatment. The regimen included TDx3 (thalidomide 400mg/d, pulse dexamethasone 32mg TDS x 5d every 3 weeks PO), followed by DT-PACEx2 (thalidomide 400mg/d, dexamethasone 40mg/d x 4 PO and cisplatin 10mg/m 2 /d, doxorubicin 10mg/m 2 /d, cyclophosphamide 400mg/m 2 /day, etoposide 40mg/m 2 /d as 4 day infusion administered 4 weeks apart, supported with G-CSF 10m g/Kg/d). Thromboprophylaxis was warfarin (target INR 1.5\u20132.0) during TD and enoxaparin 40mg/day (adjusted according to platelet count) during DT-PACE. Stem cells were harvested at recovery from the second cycle of DT-PACE in the first 27 patients, but after review of the harvest results the remaining patients were harvested after first cycle of DT-PACE with an option to re-harvest after the second if the initial harvest was insufficient. Paraprotein and BJP responses and stem cell collections were compared to a historical cohort of 58 patients treated with VAD and mobilised with cyclophosphamide 5G/m 2 and G-CSF 5m g/Kg. Results: 23/37 patients completed study treatment, 21 had successful stem cell harvests. There were 2 deaths (1 sepsis, 1 haemorrhage) and 2 failed stem cell harvests. After TD x 3 and VAD x3 the mean levels of paraprotein (or BJP) were 21% and 34% of pre-treatment levels, respectively (p=0.02). After DT-PACE x 2 and HD cyclophosphamide the mean levels of paraprotein (or BJP) were 14% and 31 % respectively (p=0.014). At the completion of TDx3 42% of patients had achieved VGPR and 50% PR, whereas after VAD x 3 there was 12% CR, 17% VGPR and 45% PR (p=0.231). Following DT-PACEx2 there was 22% CR, 39% VGPR and 26% PR and after HD cyclophosphamide there was 9% CR, 19% VGPR and 45% PR (p=0.039). The median number of CD34+ cells/kgBW harvested was 4.7 x 10 6 after DT-PACE and 11.6 x 10 6 after HD cyclophosphamide (p=0.001). The median number of aphereses procedures required was 2 for both study patients and historical controls. 58 serious adverse events included 20 episodes of infection (9 during TD and 11 during DT-PACE), 3 episodes of haemorrhage, 1 pulmonary embolus and 2 deaths. Conclusion: Thalidomide dexamethasone combination appears to be as efficacious as VAD in reducing tumour burden in de-novo multiple myeloma. The addition of DT-PACE improves the pre-transplant CR and VGPR rate. In most patients adequate stem cell harvest can be obtained, but yields appear to be less than after VAD/HD cyclophosphamide. Thalidomide dexamethasone followed by DT-PACE is associated with tolerable but not insignificant toxicity.",
