    "abstract_text": "Hematologic side effects of cancer chemotherapy like myelosuppression are frequently dose-limiting. Lentiviral gene therapy with cytostatic drug resistance gene transfer to human hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+) is a promising approach to overcome this problem. In this context it is of interest if chemotherapy mediated selection has an impact on lentiviral integration site patterns of transduced hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+). Concerning this issue, human CD34+ cells transduced with a lentiviral self-inactivating (SIN) vector encoding MGMT P140K (the O6-BG resistant mutant of O6-methylguanine- DNA methyltransferase) were in vitro treated with the alkylating agent BCNU. For integration site analysis LM-PCR was performed and integration patterns of the treated and untreated CD34+ cells were analyzed and compared with an in silico set of 10 6 random integrations. We found different integration preferences of the lentiviral vector between either the treated (82 integrations) or the untreated (30 integrations) CD34+ cells and the in silico set: both groups showed chromosomal preferences, a significant bias for integrations in genes (74,4% in the treated, respectively 70% in the untreated to 40% in the in silico group), especially by favouring introns, a random integration distribution regarding transcription start sites (TSS), and most importantly no significant differences concerning the number of integrations in or near cancer genes. Concerning all integration characteristics we could not find significant differences when comparing the untreated with the treated group. In conclusion, the general distribution of lentiviral integrations in either untreated or treated human CD34+ cells showed no distinct differences between both groups but significant differences compared to the in silico integration set. These results suggest that chemoselection of cells lentivirally overexpressing a specific chemoresistence gene might not influence the integration pattern. Therefore chemotherapy pressure seems not to hamper the safety of lentiviral vectors in gene transfer studies.",
