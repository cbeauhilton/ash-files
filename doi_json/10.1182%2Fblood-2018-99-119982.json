    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous malignancy with high relapse rates and mortality due to the outgrowth of chemotherapy-resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Thus, the development of novel therapeutic strategies capable of eradicating human AML represents a major area of unmet medical need. The RNA binding protein, LIN28, is a known driver of many cancer stem cells, AML included, wherein overexpression of LIN28 correlates with reduced patient survival. LIN28 blocks the function of the let-7 microRNA family, which exert tumor suppressive effects by repressing oncogenes and cell cycle regulators including MYC , RAS and CyclinD . Thus, LIN28 is an attractive mechanistic target for the purpose of inhibiting AML LSCs. Using a targeted high-throughput screen, we identified a class of small molecules which selectively block the LIN28/let-7 interaction (Roos et al., ACS Chem Biol, 2016). Preliminary studies demonstrate that a lead small molecule markedly impairs the proliferation and clonogenic capacity of human AML cell lines and primary patient AML samples. In vivo , systemic administration of a lead small molecule LIN28/let-7 inhibitor decreases leukemic tumor burden, reduces LSC numbers and significantly improves animal survival. Mechanistic studies revealed that targeted inhibition of the LIN28/let-7 axis restores let-7 microRNA levels in AML LSCs and subsequently inhibits a panoply of key oncogenic driver genes, including the NF-\u0138B pathway, a hallmark for LSC proliferation. Furthermore, AML cell lines and primary patient cells treated with the LIN28/let-7 small molecule inhibitor showed a block at the G1/S phase interface and significantly decreased cell cycle progression. Consequently, LIN28/let-7 inhibition leads to LSC differentiation and ultimately leukemic cell death. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time the drugability of the LIN28/let-7 axis in vivo and reveal a novel pharmacological means to suppress a multitude of oncogenic driver genes in human AML. These results suggest that small molecule inhibition of LIN28/let-7 has high therapeutic potential as a new class of targeted therapies for AML.
