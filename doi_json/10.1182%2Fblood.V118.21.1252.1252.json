    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1252 Introduction: Edoxaban is an oral, direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor currently in phase 3 clinical development for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Guidance for the emergency management of serious bleeding and strategies for reversing the anticoagulant effects edoxaban are needed. Both recombinant human FVIIa (rhFVIIa; NovoSeven \u00ae ) and a human plasma fraction containing nonactivated forms of FII, FIX, and FX/proteins C and S and activated FVII (FEIBA; factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity) have been identified as potential reversal agents for edoxaban. The minimum effective doses and the time course required for either rhFVIIa or FEIBA to reverse supratherapeutic concentrations of edoxaban in an anticoagulated patient have yet to be established. This ex vivo study was conducted to assess the effects and establish the time course of various concentrations of rhFVIIa and FEIBA on the reversal of edoxaban's anticoagulant effects. Methods: Edoxaban at supratherapeutic concentrations of 500 and 1000 ng/mL (therapeutic level is \u223c250 ng/mL for C max of a 60-mg dose) was added to fresh blood drawn from healthy subjects; control samples were diluent alone. After 60 min of incubation, rhFVIIa, FEIBA, or control was added to the samples. rhFVIIa was added to produce final concentrations of 0.8 and 1.8 \u03bcg/mL, which correspond to known maximal observed human plasma concentrations at doses of 40 and 90 \u03bcg/kg. FEIBA was added to produce concentrations of 0.75 and 1.4 U/mL, which correspond to human plasma concentrations at the therapeutic doses of FEIBA of 50 to 100 U/kg. In order to determine reversal of anticoagulant effects over time, coagulation assays (PT, aPTT, anti-Xa, intrinsic FXa activity, thrombin generation assay [TGA], D-dimer, and FVIIa activity) were measured at times 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2, and 4 h after incubation with rhFVIIa, FEIBA, or control. Results: In edoxaban alone and control samples, PT, aPTT, and anti-Xa results reflected previously established anticoagulant activity. Both 500 and 1000 ng/mL of edoxaban completely inhibited intrinsic FXa and thrombin generation as measured by TGA (peak). Measures of FVIIa activity indicated that the concentrations of rhFVIIa utilized were consistent with previously reported responses. With the exception of thrombin levels, reversal of edoxaban anticoagulant activity by both rhFVIIa and FEIBA was observed for PT, aPTT, and anti-Xa beginning at 0.25 h and was maintained across the experimental period. At 1000 ng/mL edoxaban, the observed decrease at 0.25 h post-reversal of anticoagulant activity was 82% for anti-Xa, 72% for PT, and 58% for aPTT. Compared with baseline, the maximum reversal of intrinsic FXa activity for edoxaban 500 ng/mL was \u223c30% and for 1000 ng/mL was 15% across all concentrations of rhFVIIa and FEIBA. The TGA assay indicated both rhFVIIa and FEIBA reversed \u223c45% and 20% of the effect of edoxaban at 500 ng/mL and 1000 ng/mL, respectively, 4 h after adding the reversal agents. With the exception of 1 baseline sample, levels of D-dimer did not show significant changes with the addition of edoxaban or with its subsequent reversal by either rhFVIIa or FEIBA. Conclusion: Low therapeutic concentrations of rhFVIIa and FEIBA showed significant and rapid reversal of supratherapeutic concentrations of the anticoagulant activity induced by edoxaban based on PT, aPTT, and anti-Xa activity.
