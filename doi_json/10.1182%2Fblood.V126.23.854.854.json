    "abstract_text": "Acute Graft-vs.-Host Disease (aGVHD) is the major cause of mortality and morbidity following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT). Steroids are the standard initial therapy yet only ~50-60% will achieve a response. Strategies to improve response and minimize steroid-exposure are needed. We report the results of a randomized trial of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) plus steroids vs. steroids- alone as initial therapy for aGVHD. Methods: This was a Phase II, randomized, adaptive Bayesian design. Patients with histologically confirmed aGVHD and who received  0.80, that arm would be declared the preferred treatment. Pts and Results: Between 2008 and 2014 eighty-one (81) pts were randomized to ECP + MP (51 pts) or MP-alone (30 pts). Median age was 54 yrs (range, 17-75); 42% had AML/MDS and 62% were male. HCT was performed with myeloablative conditioning in 69% and 63% had an unrelated donor. At enrollment, 90% of patients had aGVHD grade II, 10% had grade III/IV. Organ Involvement was: skin (86%), upper GI (22%), lower GI (22%) and liver (10%). The treatment arms were balanced for all baseline characteristics. The probability that ECP+MP had a higher success rate than MP-alone was 0.815 which exceeded the protocol-specified threshold of 80%, declaring ECP-arm the preferred treatment. The ECP-arm was more beneficial in pts with skin-only aGVHD (72% vs. 57% response rate) whereas visceral-organ involvement response rates were similar (47% vs. 43%). By day 56, 43% of the evaluable patients randomized to the ECP were on physiologic doses of steroids (\u22640.1mg/kg) versus 30% for MP-alone arm (p=0.34). To study the immunologic effects of ECP, we examined the recovery of T-cell subsets by multi-parameter flow cytometry in a subset of pts randomized to the ECP+MP and MP-alone arm at enrollment and study conclusion. ECP+MP was associated with more robust recovery of CD4+ and CD8+ cells and significantly higher absolute number of regulatory T-cells (p=0.043), figure 1. Conclusions: The results of this randomized, phase II trial indicate that the addition of ECP to steroids results in higher GVHD response and facilitates steroid-tapering in pts with newly diagnosed aGVHD. This combination appears most efficacious for pts with skin-involvement. Correlative studies implicate expansion of regulatory T-cells as a possible mechanism of action through which ECP exerts its immunologic effect. Figure 1.
