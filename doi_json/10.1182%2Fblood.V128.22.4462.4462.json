    "abstract_text": "In Multiple Myeloma (MM), the t(4;14) translocation is associated with a poor outcome. However, beside this translocation, the genetic events which determine the adverse evolution of the disease and the resistance to treatments remain elusive. In this study we performed whole exome or RNA sequencing analysis of samples from 65 newly diagnosed t(4;14) MM. We found that NRAS, KRAS, MAPK and FGFR3 are frequently mutated (12%, 9%, 13.8%, and 20% respectively). Overall, the FGFR3/RAS/BRAF/MAPK genes were mutated in 36 cases (54%). There was a negative correlation between mutations in FGFR3 and those occurring in NRAS, KRAS and BRAF as expected from the mutually exclusive occurrence of mutations in these genes. In addition to alterations in TP53 and DIS3, we found marked elevated frequency of mutations in PRKD2 (10.7%), ATM/ATR (10.7%) and MYCBP2 (7.6%), reduced frequency in FAM46C (1.5%) and no mutation in TRAF3 and CCND1. Mutations in ATM/ATR were strongly associated with the MB4-2 breakpoint (Bp) ( p = 1.62 10 -4 ) and significantly correlated with mutations affecting genes coding for members of the MAPK family. We observed a positive correlation between non-silent mutations in PRKD2 and the MB4-1 or MB4-3 Bp ( p = 1.3 10 -2 ). Of note, PRKD2 mutations are exclusively found in 3 t(4;14) MM cell lines and among the 84 MM sequenced by Bolli et al. (1), none of the non t(4;14) patient were mutated in PRKD2, indicating that this genetic lesion is associated with t(4;14) MM. In the NCI-H929 t(4;14) MM cell line, which is mutated for PRKD2, encoding the PKD2 serine/threonine kinase, we observed elevated levels of phosphorylated PKD2. Furthermore, inhibition of PKD, decreased PKD2 phosphorylation and triggered reduced proliferation and apoptosis of MM cell lines and fresh plasma cells from patients in vitro . These results define a specific mutational landscape for t(4;14) MM and identify PKD2 as a potential therapeutic target in MM patients. Altogether, these results define a specific mutational landscape for t(4;14) MM and identify PKD2 as a potential therapeutic target in MM patients. Reference 1.
