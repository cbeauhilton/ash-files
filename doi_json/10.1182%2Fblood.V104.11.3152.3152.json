    "abstract_text": "There are relatively few reports in the medical literature describing psychosocial assessment of bone marrow transplant patients; what data exists primarily focuses on allogeneic transplant recipients. We have begun to prospectively assess psychosocial parameters of patients undergoing autologous transplantation using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-BMT (FACT-BMT) tool. The general questions consist of four subscales developed and normed in cancer patients that measure; physical well-being; social/family well-being; emotional well-being; functional well-being; and a specific module to address BMT-specific concerns. Each subscale is positively scored, with higher scores indicating better functioning. A baseline survey is collected by the social worker pre-transplant and a follow-up survey is administered and collected approximately 6 weeks post-transplant by the Transplant Coordinator. 56 consecutive patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplant have FACT-BMT data both pre-transplant and approximately one month post-discharge. Median age was 50. 52% are male; underlying diagnoses include NHL (45%), Hodgkin\u2019s disease (32%), myeloma (16%), AML (5%), testicular cancer (2%). 93% had chemosensitive disease at the time of transplant. All patients received peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs), and all received a chemotherapy-only preparative regimen. All patients were hospitalized for approximately three weeks for the transplant. For most of the variables measured by the FACT-BMT tool, there was no significant difference in pre-transplant and post-transplant scores. The one variable that did change was emotional well-being: patients scored statistically significantly higher post-transplant as compared to the pre-transplant score (p<0.001). We also have collected baseline FACT-BMT data on 42 consecutive allogeneic BMT recipients, as well as 12 recipients of non-myeloablative allogeneic BMT transplants. There is no significant difference in any pre-transplant variables measured by the FACT-BMT score between autologous recipients, ablative allogeneic recipients, and non-myeloablative allogeneic recipients. We conclude that patients undergoing an autologous stem cell transplant have a higher sense of emotional well-being after engraftment and hospital discharge. Presumably this reflects positive feelings about accomplishing this intensive treatment for their underlying malignancy, and suggests that emotional and physical recovery after auto-BMT is reasonably rapid. A larger dataset will hopefully allow a more detailed comparison of allo and auto BMT recipients.",
