    "abstract_text": "Red blood cell disorders like Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and \u03b2-thalassemias are caused by mutations within the gene for the hemoglobin \u03b2 (HB\u03b2) subunit. A fetal ortholog of HB\u03b2, hemoglobin \u03b3 (HB\u03b3) can prevent or reduce disease-related pathophysiology in these disorders by forming nonpathogenic complexes with the required hemoglobin \u03b1-subunit. Globin expression is developmentally regulated, with a reduction in production of the fetal ortholog (\u03b3)occurring shortly after birth and a concomitant increase in the levels of the adult ortholog (\u03b2). It has been postulated that maintaining expression of the anti-sickling \u03b3 ortholog may be of therapeutic benefit in children and adults with SCD. Indeed, individuals with the SCD mutation who also have genetic variants that maintain HB\u03b3 expression at clinically meaningful levels do not present with SCD-related symptoms. Parallel target identification efforts using CRISPR and the Fulcrum proprietary, annotated chemical probe screening set in HUDEP2 cells identified a protein complex as a key regulator of HbF expression. Structure-guided medicinal chemistry optimization led to the design of FTX-6058, a novel, potent and selective small molecule with desirable DMPK properties suitable for clinical testing. FTX-6058 treatment of differentiated primary CD34 + cells from multiple healthy donors demonstrated target engagement and potent upregulation of HBG1/2 mRNA and HbF protein. Across multiple healthy and SCD donors, FTX-6058 treatment resulted in a clinically desirable globin profile (e.g., up to 30% absolute HbF) accompanied by pancellular HbF expression, resembling the phenotype of SCD mutation carriers with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. FTX-6058 demonstrated a superior pharmacological profile relative to hydroxyurea and other small molecule compounds whose putative mechanism of action is to induce HbF. FTX-6058 treatment resulted in robust target engagement and subsequent elevation of the endogenous mouse Hbb-bh1 mRNA in wildtype CD-1 mice and, importantly, also elevation of the human HBG1 mRNA and HbF protein in the Townes SCD mouse model. Preclinical studies using a variety of in vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated the potential of FTX-6058 as a novel HbF-inducing small molecule that could be beneficial to patients with SCD and \u03b2-thalassemias. FTX-6058 was shown to be potent and selective in vitro, was well tolerated and elicited a desirable exposure-response relationship in multiple preclinical rodent models with once-a-day oral dosing and at plasma concentrations predicted to be achievable in patients. IND enabling studies for FTX-6058 have been completed. Disclosures Rahl: Fulcrum Therapeutics: Ended employment in the past 24 months.
