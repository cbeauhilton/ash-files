    "abstract_text": "Background: MEL is an effective and safe AT regimen for MM, usually administered as a single dose at 200mg/m 2 ; mucositis is dose-limiting. There is recent pre-clinical and clinical evidence of synergistic interaction of MEL with both immuno-modulatory agents (thalidomide, MPT [Palumbo, Lancet, 2006], lenalidomide, RMP [Palumbo, ASCO, 2006]) and with the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib (Velcade R ) (VMP, Mateos, ASCO, 2006). We previously reported on the marked activity of VTD in AR-MM, even in a setting of resistance to single agent thalidomide and bortezomib (Blood, January, 2004). In a clinical setting of AR-MM, we administered IV MEL after bortezomib (V) on days 1, 4, 7 +/\u2212 d 10, along with daily thalidomide (T) and dexamethasone (D), in order to achieve maximum pharmacological synergy of all 4 drugs. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of 22 patients with AR-MM, who were treated with the F-MEL-VTD regimen with the following MEL fractions: 3-F at 50\u201380mg/m2 for total doses of 150\u2013240 mg/m 2 , 18 patients; 4-F at 50\u201360mg/m 2 for total doses of 200\u2013240 mg/m 2 , 4 patients; 5-F at 15\u201350 mg/m 2 for total doses of 150\u2013250 mg/m 2 , 2 patients. V was given at doses of 1.0\u20131.3 mg/m2 immediately preceding each MEL fraction; T was dosed at 100\u2013200 mg/d from day 1 until the last day of MEL; D was given at 20\u201340 mg on the day of and after V and MEL. Two patients received 2 cycles of F-MEL-VTD, so that 24 courses could be evaluated. Results: Patient characteristics included a median age of 61yr (range, 46\u201375yr), median creatinine of 0.85mg/dL (range, 0.6\u20131.9mg/dL); abnormal cytogenetics (CA) were present in 15/22 (68%) - typifying the high-risk nature of their disease; the median number of prior regimens was 6 (range, 1\u201314); prior AT: 0 in 3 patients, 1 in 11, 2 in 8 and 3 in 1 patients. F-MEL-VTD was initiated in the outpatient setting in 15, only 3 of whom required subsequent hospital admission. Toxicities included grade 3\u20134 diarrhea mainly due to C. difficile in 8 (33%) and oral mucositis > grade 2 in only 1; grade 3 fever in 3 (12%) with Aspergillus pneumonia in 2 patients; no transplant-related mortality. Hematopoietic recovery was excellent with median times to ANC>500/microL of 10 days (range, 8\u201319d) and platelets > 50.000/microL of 17 days (range, 10\u201324d); 2 patients receiving 1.88 and 1.95 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg failed to recover platelet counts to >50.000/microL. Response rates were measured at 6 weeks, using Blade criteria: CR, 11 (46%) with an additional 3 achieving near-CR (>=n-CR, 59%); PR, 4 (17%); the remainder 24% had transient or no response. Conclusion: F-MEL-VTD was remarkably well tolerated, permitting total MEL dose escalation to > 200mg/m 2 in 13 of 22 patients, without incurring grade >2 stomatitis in the majority of patients. Due to the protracted administration involved in this regimen, the median duration of neutropenia was 10 d (range, 8 to 19d) with life-threatening infections observed in only 2 patients. These encouraging data form the basis for a randomized trial of VTD followed by standard 1-F MEL versus 3-F MEL with VTD preceding each MEL dose."
