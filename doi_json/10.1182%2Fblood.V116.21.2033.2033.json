    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2033 Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a congenital form of pure red cell aplasia characterized by a hypoproliferative, macrocytic anemia, congenital anomalies, and a predisposition to cancer. DBA, along with a growing number of human diseases, is linked to defects in ribosome biogenesis. Mutations in at least 10 ribosomal protein genes of both the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits have now been identified in over 50% of patients with DBA (Narla A, et al. Blood 2010; 115) resulting in ribosomal protein haploinsufficency and in turn a defect in ribosome biogenesis. It remains, however, unknown how these events culminate in erythroid marrow failure. The study of this pathophysiology has been hindered by a lack of animal models. We became aware of the Rps6- deleted mouse as a potential murine model of DBA (Volarevic S, et al. Science 2000; 288). RPS6 is another 40S ribosomal subunit protein required for ribosomal subunit assembly. Haploinsufficiency of RPS6 causes a phenotype reminiscent of DBA during embryogenesis (Panic L, et al. Mol Cell Biol 2006; 26), however, the erythropoietic phenotype of the conditionally-deleted Rps6 heterozygous mouse was unknown. The purpose of these studies is to fully characterize the erythroid phenotype of this mouse as a model of DBA. We demonstrate that deletion of one Rps6 allele in mice results in a macrocytic anemia and leukopenia (an absolute neutropenia and lymphocytopenia, Table 1 ). Though this finding is not typical, neutropenia has been described in DBA. Like DBA, the anemia is hypoproliferative (corrected reticulocyte counts were equivalent in rpS6 heterozygous and control mice: 3.3% \u00b1 0.21, n= 3 vs. 3.6 \u00b1 0.33, n=3; two-tailed Student's t-test, p= 0.08, which is an inappropriately low value given the deleted animals\u2019 anemia).

Hematopoietic colony assays confirm this early defect. These data suggest that haploinsufficiency of rpS6 impacts both erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis, and since the mice are not thrombocytopenic, the effect appears lineage specific, rather than occurring in a common progenitor cell. Polysome profiles to confirm a defect in ribosome biogenesis are pending. Since heterozygous mice recapitulate the erythroid phenotype of DBA, we treated the mice with standard and potential DBA therapies. Specifically, mice received 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone for 12 weeks. There was no improvement in the hemoglobin or MCV in treated animals. As DBA and 5q- syndrome myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) share an erythroid phenotype and both result from a haploinsufficiency of a ribosomal protein, we also tested whether the macrocytic anemia in rpS6 heterozygous mice responds to lenalidomide (Revlimid\u00ae, gift from Celgene Corporation, San Diego, CA). Mice received 3 mg/kg/day of lenalidomide by oral gavage for 12 weeks. The hemoglobin increased in control mice and markedly increased in rpS6 heterozygous mice after 12 weeks of therapy (13.5 \u00b1 0.4 to 14.9 \u00b1 0.2, p= 0.0 and 7.9 g/dL \u00b1 0.9 to 10.3 \u00b1 0.8, p= 0.01, respectively; mean \u00b1 SEM, Student's t-test, paired). Additionally, the MCV decreased with therapy in both groups (49.1 fL \u00b1 1.4 to 41.1 \u00b1 0.2, p=0.005 and 57.4 \u00b1 1.1 to 53.77 \u00b1 1.4, p=0.08). With the caveat that we did not monitor drug levels achieved in vivo, these data suggest that lenalidomide improves hemoglobinization and deserves further study in DBA.
