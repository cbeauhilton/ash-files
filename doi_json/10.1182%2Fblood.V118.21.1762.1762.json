    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1762 INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Efficacy of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies depends to a large extent on the induction of effective antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity and phagocytosis (ADCC/ADCP) by CD16A+ immune effector cells. Chao et al. have recently unraveled the role of antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity and phagocytosis (ADCP) in rituximab (RTX)-induced tumor cell clearance using murine models of NHL [Chao M, 2010]. Nurse-like cells (NLC) provide pro-survival signals by direct contact and/or secretion of soluble factors while remaining M2-macrophages by nature [Ysebaert L, 2011]. M2 macrophages rapidly clear multiple opsonized targets [Leidi M, 2009], infiltrate lymph nodes and bone marrow, and are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs thereby acting as important mediators of anti-CD20 mediated ADCP in CLL. We used an in vitro culture system to assess NLC-mediated ADCP mediated by RTX and obinutuzumab (GA101), a type II, glyco-engineered CD20 antibody with enhanced ADCC/ADCP through improved CD16A binding. METHODS: Antibody-mediated B cell depletion was determined by flow cytometry after antibody treatment. PBMCs from CLL patients were cultured for 14 days to allow outgrowth of NLC [Tsukada N, 2002]. Cells were collected and either (i) put in 6-well plates in the same medium without NLC (w/o NLC), or (ii) seeded back onto NLC (CLL+NLC), before anti-CD20 antibodies were added at 10\u03bcg/ml for 7d. For CD47 blocking experiments, cells were incubated for 15 min with blocking antibodies before being seeded back onto NLC. An Affymetrix Uplus2.0 chip was used for gene expression profiling (GEP) of 19 NLC and 5 normal CD14+ monocytes samples. For phenotype studies, CLL cells in suspension were thoroughly harvested with medium, and remaining adherent CLL cells were discarded from NLC by vigorous pipetting, before staining with CD47-FITC/LFA-1-PE antibodies. RESULTS: NLC phagocytic activity: GEP indicated NLCs are enriched in genes associated with phagocytic machinery compared to normal monocytes. Confocal microscopy experiments showed that NLCs are able to phagocytose CLL cells (though at a low baseline level). This phagocytic activity was significantly increased with the addition of anti-CD47 blocking antibody. NLC-ADCP is induced by anti-CD20 antibodies: When comparing B-cell depletion induced by RTX and GA101 against CLL cells with or without NLC, a significant ADCP activity was measured with RTX (15%-NLC vs 36%+NLC, two-sided p=0.028), while GA101 already had significant levels of ADCP at baseline without NLCs that was only marginally increased with the addition of NLC (45%-NLC vs 53%+NLC). Phenotype of NLC-adherent versus suspension CLL cells (n=50) in vitro : 44% and 61% of patients had an increase of CD47 and LFA-1 levels respectively (defined by an MFI increase>20% between adherent and suspension CLL cells in the same well). Mean RTX-induced B-cell depletion mediated by NLC was significantly decreased in LFA-1hi versus LFA-1lo pts (25.05% vs 45.46%, n=32, p=0.048), but GA101-induced ADCP was not inhibited (45.5% vs 53%). On the other hand, RTX (20.8% vs 48.3%, p=0.005) and GA101 (33% vs 66%, n=37, p=0.002) induced B-cell depletion was significantly reduced in CD47hi versus CD47lo patients. Anti-CD47 blocking antibody could restore both RTX and GA101-induced mean B-cell depletion (n=13, p=0.003 for RTX, p=0.025 for GA101). The combination of anti-CD47 with anti-CD20 antibodies suggest both FcR-dependent (anti-CD20) and FcR-independent (anti-CD47) mechanisms promote the observed depletion effect. NLC gene expression profiles were compared between CD47hi (n=3) versus CD47lo (n=8). Among the 15 most down-regulated genes (fold-change>2) in CD47hi samples were FCGR3A/B (fc \u22124.6, p=0.048) and FCGR1 (fc \u22122.15, p=0.01), encoding for the ADCC/ADCP receptors CD16 and CD64, respectively. This phenomenon may explain the decreased ADCP activity with RTX and GA101. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that NLC may be therapeutically exploited through mediators of ADCP, especially in lymphoid organs. For that purpose, the combination of CD47 and CD20 antibodies may be considered. Due to its efficacy even in LFA-1hi patients, GA101 is considered a better mediator of NLC-ADCP. Exploring the regulation of CD47 in CLL cells is important because it may interfere with strategies targeting surface antigens through FcgammaR-dependent mechanisms.
