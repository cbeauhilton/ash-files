    "abstract_text": "Background: Several mutation classes e.g. epigenetic (e.g. ASXL2 ), kinase (e.g. KIT, JAK2 or 3 ), cohesion etc. have been implicated with poorer outcome of patients with core binding factor acute myelogenous leukemia (CBF-AML). Most of these patients have been treated with a cytarabine and anthracycline '3+7' based induction and high dose cytarabine based consolidations. Fludarabine, high dose cytarabine and G-CSF (FLAG) based regimens have shown better relapse free survivals indicating deeper remissions. Presence of unique transcripts render CBF-AML amenable to be monitored by quantitative reduction of transcripts. Limited information is available about correlation of optimal transcript reduction with baseline mutation classes among CBF-AML patients treated with a highly effective regimen. We reported RTPCR values of \u22640.1 at end of induction and \u22640.01 at 2-3 months of remission as optimal transcript reduction in bone marrow for our patients treated with FLAG based regimen. Method: We analyzed 88 consecutive patients with CBF-AML treated with a FLAG based regimen who also had baseline mutation analysis of a minimum of 24 gene myeloid leukemia relevant next generation sequencing based panel and serial CBF-AML specific fusion transcript monitoring by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR). Mutation classes analyzed were epigenetic ( TET2, IDH1 and 2, DNMT3A, ASXL1 and 2, EZH2 ), transcription factor ( RUNX1, CEBPA, NPM1, MLL, NOTCH1 ), signal transduction ( FLT3, NRAS, KRAS, KIT, JAK2, PTPN11 ). Cohesin mutation data was available from 30 most recently treated patients. Results: Median age was 51 years (range, 22-78 years), 80 patients had idarubicin added to the FLAG regimen (FLAG-Ida) and 8 patients had gemtuzumab ozogamicin added to FLAG (FLAG-GO) after reapproval of GO in the US. With a median follow up of 4+ years, median overall survival (OS) is not reached (NR), with a 3 year OS of 75%. Median remission duration (68% at 3 years) and relapse free survival (RFS) (60% at 3 years) has not been reached. Mutations in signal transduction pathways were seen in 61%, epigenetic regulators in 41% and transcription factors in 22%. Presence of signal transduction (p=0.4), epigenetic (p= 0.8) and transcription factor (p=1) did not predict for optimal CBF-AML specific transcript reduction either at end of cycle 1 of treatment or at 2-3 months of remission. While signal transduction mutations did not predict for RFS, presence of RAS mutations trended for better RFS (p=0.06, median NR versus 43 mos) and KIT mutations (p=0.4) did not impact RFS. Conclusions: Impact of adverse mutations on outcomes in CBF-AML can potentially be overcome with effective treatment regimen.
