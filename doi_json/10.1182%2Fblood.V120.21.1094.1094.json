    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1094 Introduction With the availability of multiple new agents, management of patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has changed substantially since the initial practice guideline for ITP was developed by the American Society of Hematology (ASH). To document current practice and to determine how current practice is related to recommendations of 2 recent guidelines for ITP, an International Consensus report (ICR), 2010, and an updated ASH guideline, 2011, we surveyed practicing hematologists-oncologists in Oklahoma. Methods Separate surveys were developed for children and adults. Each survey had 3 clinical scenarios; each scenario had 5\u20137 management choices. Hematologists-oncologists were instructed to select 1 management choice. Questions were adapted from the clinical scenarios of the ASH guideline. Additionally, data were collected for [1] number of years in practice; [2] site of practice, (either University of Oklahoma Medical Center or community); and [3] the estimated number of patients with ITP seen each year. Oklahoma hematologists-oncologists were identified by searching the Oklahoma Board of Medical Licensure and the Oklahoma Osteopathic Association websites for all active physicians certified in adult/pediatric hematology/oncology as of 12/31/2011. Exclusion criteria were: physicians whose careers were devoted to full-time research/administration. Data was collected between 1/31/2012\u20133/15/2012. Only the stronger grades of recommendations by the ICR and ASH guidelines were used for comparison to the hematologists-oncologists' responses. Comparison of treatment responses to the number of years in practice was selected a priori , because it was hypothesized that hematologists-oncologists with fewer years in practice may more readily accept newer treatments while hematologists-oncologists with more years in practice may prefer more traditional management. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used to determine if treatment responses differed by number of years in practice. SAS version 9.2 was used; alpha was set at 0.05. Results All 13 (100%) Oklahoma pediatric hematologists-oncologists responded. For a child with a new diagnosis of ITP, a platelet count of 8,000/\u03bcL, and minor bleeding, 5 (38%) pediatric hematologists-oncologists selected observation without drug treatment (recommended by both guidelines). Because of the small number of pediatric hematologists-oncologists, no comparison of their responses to years in practice was performed. Eighty-three (82%) adult hematologists-oncologists responded. For an adult with a platelet count of 9,000/\u03bcL who had failed to respond to initial treatment with corticosteroids and IVIg, 32 (39%) selected splenectomy (recommended by ASH guideline); 31 (37%) selected rituximab and 13 (16%) selected thrombopoietin (TPO)-receptor agonists (both recommended by ICR). There was not a statistically significant difference between the number of years in practice for those who selected splenectomy versus all other treatment options (p = 0.07). Discussion Although both recent guidelines recommended that children with no/mild bleeding may be managed with observation regardless of the platelet count, only 5 (38%) pediatric hematologists-oncologists selected observation in this scenario. The practice guidelines have different recommendations for second-line treatment in adults: the ICR recommends TPO-receptor agonists and rituximab but not splenectomy; the ASH guideline recommends splenectomy but not TPO-receptor agonists or rituximab. For this clinical scenario, 39% of hematologists-oncologists selected splenectomy, 37% selected rituximab and 16% selected TPO-agents. These different choices and recommendations reflect the changing clinical practice. Although not statistically significant, the hematologists-oncologists who had been in practice for >20 years appeared to be more likely to select splenectomy (p=0.07), consistent with greater acceptance of newer treatments by younger hematologists-oncologists. Although these data may not be generalizable, the high survey response rate provides confidence that these data accurately reflect the judgment, if not the actual practice, of Oklahoma hematologists-oncologists. Conclusion These observations provide an estimate of actual current clinical practice for management of patients with ITP.
