    "abstract_text": "Background Single-agent studies of lenalidomide in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) have demonstrated significant activity. Recent studies reported that the combination of lenalidomide and rituximab yields high response rates in patients with FL. Three recent phase 1 studies have shown that lenalidomide administered on 10 to 14 days of 21-day cycle of R-CHOP could be safe in the initial treatment of aggressive or indolent B-cell lymphomas. Two of these studies determined 25 mg of lenalidomide as the recommended daily dose. This multicenter, open label, phase 2 trial (NCT01393756) investigated the combination of lenalidomide with R-CHOP in patients (pts) with high burden FL. Methods Pts with previously untreated FL grade 1, 2 or 3a and a high tumor burden according to GELF criteria were eligible. Pts received an induction therapy with 6 cycles of R2-CHOP given every 3 weeks (25 mg oral lenalidomide on days 1-14) followed by two additional rituximab infusions. Pegfilgrastim was administered on day 4 and oral aspirin prophylaxis (100 mg) was given daily during the cycles. Lenalidomide dose was adapted to toxicities. Pts responding to induction therapy received rituximab maintenance every 8 weeks for 2 years. The primary endpoint was the complete remission (CR/CRu) rate, according to IWRC 99, at the end of induction treatment. Secondary endpoints were safety, progression free survival, duration of response and overall survival. Results Eighty pts were enrolled from 16 LYSA centres between December 2010 and January 2012. Median age was 57 y (range 29-71); 50% were male; 92% Ann Arbor stage III-IV; 28% B symptoms, 69% ECOG performance status = 0; 25% mass >10cm; 53% bone marrow involved; 40% LDH elevated; 63% FLIPI 3-5. Sixty-eight pts (85%) received the complete induction regimen. Median interval between R2-CHOP cycles remained 21 days during treatment. Thirty-three pts (41%) experienced at least one dose reduction of lenalidomide. The complete remission (CR/CRu) rate was 74% (CI 95%: 63%-83%) and ORR was 94% (CI95%: 86%-98%).Current median follow-up is 13 months. So far, 9 pts (11%) experienced a progression/relapse. Hematologic toxicity was in the range of that observed with R-CHOP regimen with 65% grade 4 neutropenia; 12.5% grade 4 thrombocytopenia; 7.5% febrile neutropenia and no toxic death. Grade 1-2 sensory neuropathy was observed in 28 pts (36%), one pt had a grade 3 neuropathy. Twenty-nine pts (36%; grade 1-2: 27; grade 3: 2) had reversible skin toxicity, usually during the course of the first cycle. Five episodes of thrombosis occurred during treatment or follow-up, 3 were related to venous access devices and only one required discontinuation of lenalidomide. Three cases of neoplasm were observed during follow-up. Conclusion The combination of 25mg of lenalidomide for 14 days with 21-day R-CHOP cycles is well tolerated and yields a high rate of complete remission in patients with high tumor burden follicular lymphoma.
