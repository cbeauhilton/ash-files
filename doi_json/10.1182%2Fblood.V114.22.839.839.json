    "abstract_text": "Abstract 839 Although most children with ALL are cured, treatment is associated with multiple toxicities and outcome after relapse is poor. New therapies are needed to overcome drug resistance and reduce non-specific toxicities of chemotherapy. CD22 is a B-lineage differentiation antigen expressed on most B-lineage ALL blasts. The anti-CD22 immunotoxin RFB4(dsFv)-PE38 CAT-3888 (BL22) was recently shown to have clinical activity with an acceptable safety profile in children with ALL ( Blood 2007;110:262a ). We undertook a Phase I trial of a modified agent with higher CD22 binding affinity (CAT-8015 or HA22). Methods: Patients 6 months to 24 years of age with relapsed or refractory CD22 + B-lineage ALL or non-Hodgkin lymphoma were eligible for enrollment into this Phase I trial. CAT-8015 was administered at doses of 5, 10, 20, or 30 mcg/kg every-other-day for 6 doses every 21 days for up to 6 cycles. One patient was enrolled at each of the first 3 dose levels (5, 10, 20 mcg/kg) with standard 3+3 dose escalation commencing at 30 mcg/kg. All patients received acetaminophen, ranitidine and diphenhydramine to mitigate infusion-related symptoms, and prophylaxis for central-nervous-system leukemia with intrathecal hydrocortisone, cytarabine and methotrexate. Patients at high risk for tumor lysis syndrome received standard prophylaxis. Results: Seven patients with ALL (6 precursor-B, 1 mature B-cell) 5 to 17 years of age (median, 10) were treated on the clinical trial. All patients had been heavily pre-treated and had baseline cytopenias due to active malignancy and thus were not evaluable for hematologic toxicities. The most common adverse events observed to date have been hyperbilirubinemia, transaminase elevations, hypoalbuminemia, elevated creatinine, febrile neutropenia, abdominal pain, pyrexia, hypertension, microscopic proteinuria, hemoglobinuria, hypoxia and pleural effusion. Two of 4 patients treated at 30 mcg/kg experienced Grade 3 or greater toxicity consistent with capillary leak: 1 with Grade 3 pleural effusion and hypoxia and 1 with Grade 4 vascular leak syndrome. All toxicities attributed to CAT-8015 were reversible. Clinical activity was demonstrated in 4 of 7 subjects. One patient treated at 10 mcg/kg had a complete remission by morphology and flow cytometry. Three patients met the protocol definition for hematologic activity (blood count improvement). One of these patients developed high-titer neutralizing antibodies. Two patients met the protocol definition for stable disease. The patient treated at the lowest dose level had progressive disease. Conclusions: CAT-8015 appears to be active against chemotherapy-refractory ALL. Strategies to predict and/or prevent vascular leak syndrome are currently being developed.
