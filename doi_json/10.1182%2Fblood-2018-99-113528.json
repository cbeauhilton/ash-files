In current study, we aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of TCP regimen (thalidomide, cyclophosphamide and prednisone) in newly diagnosed iMCD patients. \u3010Methods\u3011From Jun, 2015 to Jun, 2018, thirty-six newly diagnosed iMCD patients were enrolled. TCP regimen (thalidomide 100mg qn for 1 year and maintained with 100mg qn for the second year; cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2 weekly on d1, 8, 15, 22 out of a 28-day cycle; prednisone 1mg/kg twice a week on d1-2, d8-9, d15-16, d22-23 out of a 28-day cycle) was administrated until death or 'treatment failure'. Data from twenty-five patients whose were followed for at least 24 weeks were extracted and analyzed. \u3010Results\u3011Among these 25 patients, the median age was 40 years (range 20-63 years), with a male : female ratio of 2.1:1. Two patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of TAFRO syndrome. After TCP treatment, 48.0% (n=12) patients achieved 'durable tumor and symptomatic response' for at least 24 weeks; 40.0% (n=10) patients were evaluated as 'treatment failure'; 12.0% (n=3) patients were considered as stable disease. The median symptom score was reduced from 14 (range 6-41) to 3 (range 0-20); the median Interleukin-6 level decreased from 21.3 pg/ml (range 7.4-865) to 9.15pg/ml (range 2.0-36.2). As for safety issues, one patient died from pulmonary infection and one patient suffered from Grade 3 rash. No other patients suffered from Grade 3 or above adverse events. With a median follow-up of 14 months (range 6-36), 8.0% (n=2) patients died: one patient died from progression of disease (severe anemia) and the other died from pulmonary infection after TCP administration. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were not reached, with the estimated 3-year PFS and OS of 60.0% and 88.0%, respectively (Figure 1). \u3010Conclusions\u3011TCP regimen, an inexpensive oral therapy, is an effective and safe first-line treatment option for newly diagnosed iMCD patients.
