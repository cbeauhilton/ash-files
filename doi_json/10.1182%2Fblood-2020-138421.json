    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph-like ALL) is a high-risk ALL subtype characterized by an inferior survival rate and chemotherapeutic drug resistance (Tasian et al , Blood 130: 2064-2072, 2017). Around 50% of Ph-like ALL cases harbour gene rearrangements leading to the overexpression of cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) (Loh et al , Blood 121: 485-488, 2013). CRLF2 (also known as thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor, TSLPR) heterodimerizes with the interleukin-7 receptor alpha (IL-7R\u03b1) subunit to form the functional TSLPR. Upon TSLP binding, CRLF2 activates the JAK/STAT signalling pathway, leading to enhanced proliferation and survival of leukemia cells resulting in poor outcomes in patients (Harvey et a l, Blood 115: 5312-5321, 2010). The extracellular overexpression of CRLF2 and association with poor prognosis suggest the translational value of designing precision-based therapeutics targeting CRLF2 in Ph-like ALL. Although conventional immunotherapy using full-sized antibodies is a promising treatment strategy that can improve treatment efficiency and minimize off-target toxicity, their clinical translation is challenging due to the high production cost and large size affecting targeting efficiency (Holliger et al , Nat Biotech 23: 1126-1136, 2005). Herein, we validated a novel single-chain variable fragment against CRLF2 (CRLF2-ScFv) for targeting Ph-like ALL cells. Methods: A CRLF2-rearranged Ph-like ALL cell line (MHH-CALL-4) was lentivirally transduced with a CRLF2-targeting shRNA driven by an inducible promoter, enabling the inducible knockdown of CRLF2. CRLF2 expression in MHH-CALL-4 cells after shRNA induction (KD-CALL-4) was evaluated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The cellular association of the CRLF2-ScFv was determined in MHH-CALL-4 and KD-CALL-4 at 4\u00b0 and 37\u00b0C using an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to visualize and compare the cellular association of CRLF2-ScFv in MHH-CALL-4 and KD-CALL-4. The cellular association of CRLF2-ScFv was also investigated ex vivo using a small panel of Ph-like and non-Ph-like ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), representing similar immunophenotype and genetic characteristics to their original disease subtypes (Liem et al , Blood 103: 3905-3914, 2004), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to investigate the non-selective association. CRLF2 expression in MHH-CALL-4 and Ph-like ALL PDX cells was quantified using indirect immunofluorescence assay. The downstream impact of CRLF2-ScFv on STAT5 phosphorylation (pSTAT5) was determined by FACS either with or without TSLP stimulation. The statistical significance was tested using Unpaired unequal variances t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons test. Statistical significance was considered when P \u2264 0.05. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Results: KD-CALL-4 showed a 75% reduction in CRLF2 expression compared with MHH-CALL-4 cells ( P = 0.0009). CRLF2-ScFv exhibited a 94% higher association with MHH-CALL-4 compared with KD-CALL-4 cells at 37\u00b0C ( P = 0.0013). The association of CRLF2-ScFv with MHH-CALL-4 cells was reduced by 75% at the non-proliferating state of cells at 4\u00b0C compared to 37\u00b0C ( P = 0.006). Orthogonally viewed confocal microscopy images showed 82% higher intracellular uptake of CRLF2-ScFv in MHH-CALL-4 compared to KD-CALL-4 cells ( P = 0.0003). CRLF2-ScFv showed >80% higher association with a Ph-like PDX sample compared with a control CRLF2 low PDX and PBMCs ( P < 0.001). Of note, a Ph-like ALL PDX exhibited only one-third of the association with CRLF2-ScFv compared with MHH-CALL-4 cells ( P = 0.04), corresponding to the significant difference in CRLF2 surface expression ( P = 0.01). CRLF2-ScFv significantly reduced pSTAT5 expression in MHH-CALL-4 cells ( P = 0.05) and prevented TSLP-induced STAT5 phosphorylation ( P = 0.01), suggesting competition with the TSLP binding site. Conclusion: CRLF2-ScFv is a selective targeting moiety for CRLF2 with a significant internalization potential and receptor antagonistic effect, highlighting the therapeutic implications for targeting Ph-like ALL.
