    "abstract_text": "Subsets of pediatric acute leukemias are refractory to frontline therapy or relapse with standard treatment. Pediatric leukemias are associated with distinct molecular and genomic alterations. Clinical genomic profiling has been used effectively to improve the diagnosis of adult leukemias. However, its use and utility for pediatric leukemias are not well defined. Here, we used FoundationOne Heme, a clinical grade, high-throughput, hybridization capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay for targeted sequencing of all exons of 405 genes as well as RNA sequencing of 265 genes. We analyzed the results of samples from 71 patients sequenced on the FoundationOne\u00ae Heme assay from children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n= 34); early T cell precursor ALL (ETP) (n=3); acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (n= 19); ambiguous lineage leukemia (n=3); and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n=12) who were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the Department of Pediatrics over a 26 month period (January 2014-March2016). Age of patients ranged from 1-24 years of age (median =10 years). 42 samples were from patients who had yet to receive cytotoxic therapy (newly diagnosed) and 29 samples were from patients who had relapsed (n=24) or had refractory disease (n=5). The current average turnaround time for FoundationOne\u00ae Heme is 12-14 days. Overall 99% (70/71) of specimens were successfully profiled. We identified 230 genomic alterations, including 59.1% (136/230) missense or nonsense mutations of genes, 15.6% (36/230) copy number alterations, and 25.6% (59/230) gene fusions or rearrangements. Molecular aberrations were detected in 81% (9/11) of patients with normal karyotypes; 55% (5/9) of these were cytogenetically cryptic genomic rearrangements including NUP98-NSD1 (n=2) and 1 MLL-PTD (n=1). We identified one novel translocation involving SATB1-PDGFRB in a sample from a patient with pre B ALL. Another patient with pre B ALL was found to have a unique combination of genomic alterations including an MLL-PTD and SSBP2-JAK2 . Two patients with MDS were identified as harboring germline GATA2 mutations, indicating the likely benefit of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Three patients had therapy modifications based on findings with the addition of dasatinib ( ZMIZ1-ABL1 ), ruxolitinib ( PCM1-JAK2 ) and trametinib ( PTPN11 mutation), and two patients had risk stratification altered based on MLL rearrangements which were not identifiable by conventional cytogenetics. Overall, the use of comprehensive genomic profiling led to improved accuracy of diagnosis or alteration of therapy in 10% (7/71) cases, including molecular based therapy selection (n=3), escalation of conventional chemotherapy due to high-risk features (n=2), and inclusion of stem cell transplantation (n=2). Thus, clinical genomic profiling of pediatric acute leukemia led to discovery of new pathobiology, improved accuracy of clinical diagnosis, and inclusion of targeted molecular therapies.
