    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Direct oral anticoagulants are as effective as vitamin K antagonists for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and are associated with less bleeding. We have reported that a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban exerts a thrombus resolution effect in a rat model of venous thrombosis and enhances tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA)-induced clot lysis in human plasma. However, the mechanism underlying the thrombus resolution effect and fibrinolysis enhancement by edoxaban remains to be determined. Purposes: To evaluate the effect of edoxaban on plasmin generation during clot lysis in human plasma in vitro. To determine the role of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) in the enhancement of fibrinolysis by edoxaban. Methods: Pooled human normal plasma or TAFI-deficient plasma (both containing 180 ng/mL t-PA and 0.1 nM thrombomodulin) was mixed with edoxaban, an activated TAFI (TAFIa) inhibitor (a fibrinolysis enhancer) potato tuber carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI), or vehicle. Clot was induced by adding 2.5 pM tissue factor and 4 \u00b5M phospholipids. To monitor the clot formation and lysis, the absorbance of plasma at 405 nm was measured every 30 sec. Clot lysis time was defined as the interval between the time of the midpoint of the clear to maximum turbidity transition and the midpoint of the maximum turbidity to clear transition. Plasmin-\u03b12 antiplasmin complex (PAP) concentration was measured by ELISA as an indicator of plasmin generation. Results: In normal plasma, PCI accelerated clot lysis and increased plasma PAP concentration. There was a correlation between plasma PAP concentration and percent of clot lysis, indicating that plasma PAP concentration is an appropriate marker of fibrinolysis. Edoxaban at clinically relevant concentrations (75, 150, and 300 ng/mL) significantly shortened clot lysis time and elevated plasma PAP concentration. The additive combined effect of edoxaban and PCI was observed. In TAFI-deficient plasma, clot lysis time was shortened and plasma PAP concentration increased compared with normal plasma. In these samples, the effects of edoxaban and PCI on clot lysis and plasma PAP concentration were markedly diminished as compared with normal plasma. Conclusions: Edoxaban at clinically relevant concentrations enhanced t-PA-induced clot lysis with increasing plasma PAP concentration in human plasma. The effects of edoxaban on clot lysis and plasmin generation were diminished in TAFI-deficient plasma. A TAFIa inhibitor PCI exerted similar effects. These data suggest that edoxaban enhanced fibrinolysis via inhibition of TAFI activation and enhancement of plasmin generation. Disclosures Morishima: Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.: Employment.
