    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4919 Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is characterized by the presence of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow and the secretion of IgM monoclonal antibody in the serum. Several conventional therapies are available but the disease remains incurable. Recently, bortezomib (a proteasomal inhibitor) has shown promising anti-WM activity with enhanced responses when combined with traditional therapies. Resistance to bortezomib therapy is an important event that is associated with continued treatment. In order to understand the mechanism of bortezomib resistance in WM we exposed BCWM.1 (a known WM cell line) in vitro to increasing concentrations of bortezomib over prolonged periods of time and isolated the bortezomib resistant clone (BCWM.1/BR). This clone was compared with its parent wild type cell line (BCWM.1/WT). Investigation to understand the susceptibility of BCWM.1/Br cells to various therapeutic agents showed that these cells are resistant to many of the agents such as melaphalan, fludarabine or doxorubicin. Interestingly, verapamil, a broad spectrum inhibitor of multidrug resistance, failed to reverse the resistance induced by bortezomib indicating that bortezomib resistance is not because of an activation of multidrug resistance in these cells. While BCWM.1/WT cells showed an IC 50 of 7.8nM when treated for 72h with bortezomib, the BCWM.1/BR cells were not inhibited at any concentration of the compound up to 100nM. Furthermore, the cells with the acquired resistance showed a 4 fold increase in the proteasomal activity as measured by the release of a fluorescent product (7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC)) from its peptide substrate, suc-LLVY-AMC. Biochemical analysis further revealed that many of the proteasomal components are altered in BCWM.1/BR cells as compared to their parental control cells. Interestingly, protein levels of two of the proteasomal catalytic subunits, PSMB5 and PSMB9 are upregulated in resistant cells suggesting a reason for the enhanced proteasomal activity of these cells. The resistant cells showed an altered gene expression profile that indicates a transformation of the parental wild type cell line to acquire resistance. A comparative analysis of the signal transduction pathways operated in these cells showed that many of the activation and cell survival pathways that are present in BCWM.1 cells are inhibited in the resistant cells. For example, BCWM.1 cells show a constitutive activation of AKT and ERK1/2 which are inhibited in the resistant cells thus making them insensitive to the inhibitors of these pathways. Similarly, HSP27 which was earlier shown to contribute to bortezomib induced resistance was completely inhibited in BCWM.1 resistant cells. Interestingly, there is an increase in Bcl-2 protein in BCWM.1/BR cells as compared to WT cells indicating that the resistant cells might be dependent on Bcl-2 family for their survival. Inhibition of Bcl-2 induced potent apoptosis in BCWM.1/BR cells. Thus the results presented here indicate that acquired bortezomib resistance in BCWM.1 cells alters their proteasomal activity, cellular signaling pathways to make them resistant to many of the known therapies but these cells retain the Bcl-2 mediated pathway for targeting thus inhibitors of Bcl-2 may be used in therapy against bortezomib-resistant WM.
