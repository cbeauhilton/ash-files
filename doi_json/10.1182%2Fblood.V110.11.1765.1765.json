    "abstract_text": "Factor V (FV) circulates as procofactor with little or no procoagulant activity and is activated upon proteolytic removal of a central B-domain. Recently, we have shown that discrete B-domain sequences stabilize the inactive procofactor state and that their deletion drives the expression of procoagulant function without the need for proteolytic processing ( JBC  2007 ; 282 : 15033 ). While the B-domain length is highly conserved in most mammals (\u223c800 aa), recent genomic data indicates that in some vertebrates the FV B-domain is dramatically shortened. The most striking example is found in an Australian snake family ( P. textilis and O. scutellatus ). These snakes, which are among the most venomous in Australia, have a powerful prothrombin activating complex in their venoms consisting of FXa-like and FVa-like components. Remarkably, both plasma FV and venom FV sequences of these snakes predict a B-domain of only 45 and 46 residues, suggesting that snake FV may have lost B-domain sequences that maintain the protein as procofactor. Alternatively, snake FV could use a different strategy to preserve the procofactor state. To gain insight into this, we expressed and purified venom-derived P. textilis FV (pt-FV) in BHK cells. Pt-FV expressed very well (4mg protein/L media), and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that it migrated as a single-chain protein with a molecular mass of \u223c180 kDa. Upon incubation with thrombin (IIa), pt-FV was completely processed to pt-FVa, yielding fragments similar to the human FVa heavy and light chains. Surprisingly, pt-FVa migrated as a single band on a non-reducing gel, indicating that the heavy and light chains are held together by a disulfide bond. Sequence analysis suggests that this disulfide bond is located between the A2 and A3 domains. Functional analysis using a PT-based clotting assay with human FV-deficient plasma demonstrated that pt-FV has low activity compared to human FVa. This is consistent with previous studies which showed that venom FV is a relatively ineffective cofactor when using bovine factor Xa (FXa), suggesting that it needs snake-derived FXa to optimally function. Despite the low reactivity towards human plasma, we were able to demonstrate that processing of pt-FV to pt-FVa did not significantly increase cofactor activity (activation quotient of 2 compared to 10\u201315 for human FV). This suggests that unlike all nonhuman FV variants characterized so far, pt-FV is expressed as a constitutively active cofactor. Consistent with this, assessment of cofactor activity using a purified prothrombinase assay with either human FXa or transiently expressed O. scutellatus FXa revealed that the initial rates of prothrombin activation were equivalent for pt-FV or pt-FVa. To further confirm these results we expressed and purified pt-FV in which IIa cleavage sites Arg709 and Arg1545 were eliminated (pt-FV-QQ). SDS-PAGE analysis showed that pt-FV-QQ was not cleaved by IIa, yet functional measurements revealed that its activity was similar to pt-FV or pt-FVa. These data indicate that pt-FV has constitutive cofactor activity and thus bypasses the normal proteolytic processing step to function within prothrombinase. This is in agreement with our previous findings that discrete sequences within the FV B-domain are necessary to maintain FV as procofactor. Thus, venom-derived P. textilis FV represents the first example of a naturally occurring FV variant that does not require proteolytic processing to be active.",
