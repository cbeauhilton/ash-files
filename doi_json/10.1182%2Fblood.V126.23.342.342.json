    "abstract_text": "Background: Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive B-cell lymphoma that is largely curable with intensive therapy. Previously, a single-center study of 30 patients demonstrated that DA-EPOCH-R based therapy was highly effective in adults with BL (N Engl J Med 2013; 369:1915-1925). We set out to validate these results in a multi-center study and assess if a risk-adapted approach using DA-EPOCH-R is effective. Methods: Patients had newly diagnosed BL, age 18 years or older and HIV negative or positive. Low-risk (LR) patients (normal LDH, ECOG P.S. 0-1, stage I or II disease and a maximum tumor size < 7cm) received 3 cycles of DA-EPOCH-R (with no intrathecal prophylaxis) and all other patients (classified as high risk (HR)) received 6 cycles (with IT prophylaxis days 1 and 5 on cycles 3-6). Results: 77 patients were enrolled. Characteristics include median (range) age 45 (19-78) years; male sex 63 (82%); stage III or IV disease 49 (64%); elevated LDH 41 (53%); CNS involvement 7 (10%); HIV positive 20 (26%). Eleven (14%) and 66 (86%) were classified as LR and HR respectively. There were 2 deaths on treatment in the HR arm secondary to infection. Other toxicities were similar to previous reports of DA-EPOCH-R. At a median follow-up time of 25 months, time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 92% (95% CI: 82.9-96.8%), 87% (95% CI: 76.2-93%) and 88% (95% CI: 77.1-93.8%) respectively for all patients. TTP, PFS and OS were not significantly different for HR versus LR disease, HIV positive versus negative and age over versus under 40y. Conclusions: In a multicenter setting, both LR and HR patients have excellent outcomes with 3 and 6 cycles of therapy respectively. Risk group, HIV status and age are not associated with outcome (see table). Accrual to this study continues (NCT01092182). Table.  . . TTP . PFS . OS .
