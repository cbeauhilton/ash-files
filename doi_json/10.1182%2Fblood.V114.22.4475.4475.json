    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4475 Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is frequently complicated by life-threatening graft versus host disease (GVHD). Previous studies demonstrated that T cell depletion (TCD) of the graft significantly decreases the incidence and severity of GVHD, and is associated with a higher percentage of patients with mixed chimerism (MC). In most studies chimerism analysis is performed on the total bone marrow (BM) leukocyte fraction, and changes in chimerism are related to engraftment. In this study we investigated whether MC in the total BM leukocyte fraction truly reflects engraftment or if it is influenced by survival and expansion of donor and recipient residual mature T cells, and whether hematopoietic lineage specific chimerism analysis is therefore a better method to determine engraftment. It is likely that chimerism analysis of the stem cell compartment is best reflected in peripheral blood (PB) in those cells that are continuously produced and short lived, such as monocytes and granulocytes, and therefore PB myeloid chimerism primarily reflects engraftment. In contrast, previous studies have shown by T cell receptor excision circle analysis that T cell neogenesis is virtually absent in the first 6 months after alloSCT, and that predominantly memory T cells are present in PB and BM. Therefore, we hypothesize that MC of these long lived T cells merely reflects survival and expansion of recipient and donor residual T cells. Since the life span of B and NK cells is longer than myeloid cells, but shorter than T cells, we anticipate that in the first 6 months after alloSCT, B and NK cell chimerism reflects a combination of survival and neogenesis. To analyze these hypotheses we performed hematopoietic lineage specific chimerism analysis on PB cells of 22 patients (median age 52 years, range 23-73, 11 males) receiving a TCD alloSCT between June and November 2008 after a myeloablative (n=11) or non myeloablative conditioning regimen (n=11) for AML, ALL, high risk MDS, multiple myeloma, CML, CLL or NHL. At intervals of 6 weeks PB was collected, and monocytes, granulocytes, B and NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were sorted. The total leukocyte fraction was obtained by erythrocyte lysis of BM. DNA was isolated to perform chimerism analysis using short tandem repeats - PCR. Our results show that in the BM leukocyte fraction 47% of the patients were MC at 3 months after alloSCT, with a median frequency of patient cells of 4%. However, of the patients with MC in the total leukocyte fraction, 67% was complete chimeric in the myeloid subsets and MC in the T cell compartment. In the PB myeloid subsets (monocytes and granulocytes) less than 28% of the patients were MC during the first 6 months after alloSCT with a median frequency of patient cells less than 5%. In the B and NK cell subsets, at most time points more patients were MC (7-43%) with higher frequencies of patient cells (2-14%) compared to the myeloid subsets. The CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets showed the highest frequencies of MC in numbers of patients (31-61%) as well as the highest MC frequencies of patient cells (13-80%). Phenotypic analysis of the T cell compartment showed that 98% of the CD4 and CD8 T cells were memory cells during the first 6 months after alloSCT. Preliminary data indicate that the median percentage of donor derived T cells increased during the first 6 months after alloSCT, correlating with development of mild GVHD, suggesting that T cell chimerism is influenced by immunogenic triggers. In conclusion, these results illustrate that for engraftment and neogenesis of donor hematopoiesis, myeloid chimerism analysis provides more accurate information than total BM leukocyte chimerism analysis, since the results are greatly influenced by T cell chimerism. Since almost all T cells were memory cells within the first 6 months after alloSCT, T cell chimerism analysis reflects survival and expansion of mature donor as well as recipient T cells, and can therefore not be used to measure engraftment.
