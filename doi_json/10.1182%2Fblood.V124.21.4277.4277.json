    "abstract_text": "Introduction. The optimal duration of Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) after cancer associated deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is unknown; current guidelines suggest to prolong anticoagulation until cancer is active. We have recently demonstrated, in a randomized trial, that detection of Residual Vein Thrombosis (RVT) after 6 months of LMWH identify patients who require or not extension of therapy with anticoagulants (JCO in press). Now we present data of a prospective study evaluating a RVT-based management of patients with cancer-associated DVT, in whom LMWH has been extended up to 2 years in patients considered at high-risk for recurrent DVT because of persistence of RVT. Material and Methods. Patients were included at the time of a first diagnosis of cancer-associated DVT of the lower limbs. All received LMWH at therapeutic dosage for the first month (approximately 100 UI anti-FXa b.i.d.) then reduced at 75% for the following months. After 6 months of heparin, the presence of RVT was detected: those without RVT (no-RVT group) suspended treatment, while those with RVT (RVT group) continued LMWH for up to 2 years. Recurrent thrombosis and/or bleeding events were recorded during treatment and one year after LMWH withdrawal. Baseline differences between groups were assessed by the chi-square test (Yates\u2019 correction) for categorical variables and ANOVA test or Kruskal-Wallis test for parametric and nonparametric analyses. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated. Results. Between January 2009 and April 2011, 211 cancer patients were enrolled; RVT was detected in 129 patients (61.1%). Recurrent VTE occurred in 19 (14.7%); 4 episodes (3.1%) occurred while on heparin. Among patients without RVT (82), 3 (3.6%) developed recurrent VTE (after LMWH therapy). Adjusted HR for RVT vs no-RVT group was 5.8 (95% CI, 1.9 to 19.2; p 0.0003). Three major bleeding events occurred in RVT group and one in no-RVT group (during LMWH administration). The HR for major bleeding (RVT vs no-RVT group) was 2.58 (95% CI, 0.66 to 12.43;p 0.103). Overall, 44 patients (20.8%) died during follow-up as a result of cancer progression. Conclusions. These results indicate that in patients without RVT, a short period of treatment with a LMWH is sufficient; in those with persistent RVT, treatment extended to 2 years substantially reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of recurrent thrombosis. However, when still on LMWH, the risk for recurrent VTE is low. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
