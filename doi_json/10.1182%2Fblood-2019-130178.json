    "abstract_text": "Background: The CALM-AF10 translocation is detected in ~10% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs), and in some acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). CALM-AF10 leukemias are characterized by high expression of proleukemic HOXA genes, which serve a critical role in hematopoiesis. We hypothesized that identification of novel CALM-AF10 effector genes may yield new therapeutic targets in this difficult to treat leukemia. We took advantage of our prior observation that the nuclear export factor CRM1/XPO1 tethers CALM-AF10 to HOXA genes by interacting with a nuclear export signal (NES) in CALM. Using next generation sequencing, we determined that, SIX1, similar to HOXA genes, is increased in CALM-AF10 leukemias and decreased in response to CRM1 inhibition with Leptomycin B (LMB). Design/Methods: RT-qPCR and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation were performed using both bone marrow progenitors and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) transduced with CALM-AF10 or an empty vector, with and without LMB. The ability of SIX1 to enhance self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitors was examined by measuring the colony-forming ability of transduced fetal liver hematopoietic progenitor cells. CRISPR-Cas9 was used to silence SIX1 in Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Results: RT-qPCR confirmed overexpression of SIX1 in both CALM-AF10 transduced MEFs and CALM-AF10 leukemias, with decreased SIX1 expression observed in the presence of LMB. ChIP analysis showed that CALM-AF10 binds to the SIX1 gene locus. Overexpression of SIX1 in fetal liver cells was sufficient to increase the self-renewal potential of colony-forming progenitors. SIX1 was successfully knocked out in HEK293 cells without a significant effect on HEK293 proliferation. Conclusions: The SIX1 homeobox gene is highly expressed during development and its expression is silenced post-embryogenesis. Increased SIX1 expression has been reported in numerous solid tumors. We have determined that SIX1 is upregulated in CALM-AF10 leukemias, and increases the self-renewal potential of hematopoietic progenitors. Using CRISPR-Cas9 to silence SIX1 , we have demonstrated that SIX1 is not essential for cell survival, and that its inhibition may impair CALM-AF10 leukemia cell proliferation. Thus, SIX1 may play a pathogenic role in leukemogenesis and is a potential therapeutic target in CALM-AF10 leukemias. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
