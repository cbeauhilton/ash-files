Recent evidence suggests a correlation between CD34+ cell yield on Day 1 of collection and total CD34+ cell yield as well as post-transplant outcomes. This analysis was designed to: 1) compare Day 1 collection between patients with NHL or MM mobilized with plerixafor plus G-CSF or placebo plus G-CSF; and 2) determine whether Day 1 CD34+ cell yields correlated with the total mobilization yield and number of apheresis days. Methods Data were obtained from two prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trials that compared the safety and efficacy of plerixafor (0.24 mg/kg/day SQ) plus G-CSF (10 \u03bcg/kg/day) with placebo plus G-CSF for mobilization of HSC for auto-HSCT in patients with NHL (3101 Study) or MM (3102 Study). Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the association of day 1 CD34+ cell collection with total CD34+ cell yield and the number of days of apheresis. Results In the NHL trial, 150 patients were mobilized with plerixafor plus G-CSF and 148 patients underwent mobilization with placebo plus G-CSF. More than half the patients (55.3%) in the plerixafor group collected \u22652 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg on Day 1 of apheresis ( Figure 1 A). In contrast, 19.6% patients in the placebo group collected \u2265 2 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg on Day 1 of apheresis (p< 0.001). In the MM study, 148 patients were mobilized with plerixafor plus G-CSF and 154 patients were mobilized with placebo plus G-CSF. More than half the patients (52.7%) in the plerixafor group collected \u22656 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg on the first day of collection compared to only 16.9% patients in the placebo group (p<0.001; Figure 1 B). There was a strong positive correlation between day 1 collection and the total CD34+ cell yield in patients with NHL (r= 0.86, p-value= <0.0001) or MM (r= 0.87, p-value= <0.0001) in both the plerixafor and placebo groups. For NHL patients, the median Day 1 collection was higher in the plerixafor group compared to the placebo group: 2.66 \u00d7 10 6 vs. 0.77 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg (p<0.001) and this translated into higher total CD34+ cell yields in the two groups respectively: 5.69 \u00d7 10 6 vs. 1.98 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg (p<0.001). Similarly, for MM patients, the median CD34+ cells/kg collected on Day 1 was higher in the plerixafor group compared to the placebo group: 7.01 \u00d7 10 6 vs. 2.29 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg (p<0.001) and this translated into better overall collection in the plerixafor vs. placebo groups: 10.96 \u00d7 10 6 vs. 6.18 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg (p<0.001). A negative correlation was observed between CD34+ cells collected on Day 1 and the number of days of apheresis performed in patients with NHL (r= -0.67, p-value=<0.0001) or MM (r= -0.50, p-value= <0.0001) in both the plerixafor and placebo groups. Consequently, better Day 1 collection in plerixafor-treated NHL or MM patients translated into significantly fewer apheresis days to achieve the target collection compared to placebo treated patients. Conclusions These data support previous reports demonstrating a strong correlation between day 1 CD34+ cell collection and total CD34+ cell yield and apheresis days. These data also demonstrate that addition of plerixafor to G-CSF allows significantly more patients to achieve the target cell collection within 1 day of apheresis compared to G-CSF alone. These findings support the observation that mobilization with plerixafor plus G-CSF reduces the number of apheresis days required to achieve the minimal or optimal cell dose to proceed to transplantation.
