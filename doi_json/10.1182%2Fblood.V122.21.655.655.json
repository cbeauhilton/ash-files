    "abstract_text": "Familial MDS is rare and usually associated with early presentation in childhood. We encountered identical twins presenting with concordant MDS (RCMD-subtype) and a strong family history of leukemia. Their diseases demonstrated several unifying features, including a clinical response to lenalidomide despite neither twin expressing the del(5q) abnormality, resulting in transfusion-independence and restoration of normal counts. Whole exome sequencing (WES) for confirmatory deep targeted sequencing identified the same somatic heterozygous missense mutation of DDX41 , c.G1574A (p.R525H) in both cases. In addition, we found diversifying accessory somatic mutations; in case 1 the clonal architecture consisted of DDX41 , PHF6 (c.59delG, p.C20fs) and DNMT3A (c.T1180C, p.C394R) in 45%, 14%, and 15% reads, respectively, while in the 2 nd case the clone consisted of 37% DDX41 and 50% JAK2 (c.G1849T, p.V617F) mutant reads. We also found a rare non-synonymous alteration of DDX41, c.T1187C (p.I396T) present in the germline DNA in both twins (the prevalence of this germline minor allele in the general population is <.05%). DDX41 is a member of the DEAD-box helicase family, the largest of the helicase families. RNA helicases are involved in RNA metabolism, spliceosomal function, ribosome biogenesis, pre-mRNA splicing and translation initiation. To assess the clinical importance of DDX41 and other RNA helicase mutations, we screened a cohort of 763 patients (pts) with myeloid neoplasms and also analyzed the TCGA AML cohort. We found 1.04% (N=10/960) of DDX41 mutations among MDS/AML pts and other RNA helicases mutations including DDX23 as follows : 0.47% (N=2/419), DDX4 : 0.24% (N=1/419), DDX54 : 0.1% (N=1/960) and DHX33 : 0.48%(N=2/419) were demonstrated. We also found 2 rare germline events of DHX29 : c.G1627A, p.V543M and c.G1561A, p.E521K. We further focused on the most prevalent DDX41 lesions located on the long arm of chromosome 5. SNP-array identified deletions of 5q involving the DDX41 locus (5q35.3) in 16% of cases. Expression analysis found that DDX41 mRNA levels were significantly lower in cases with del(5q) affecting the DDX41 locus than in those without deletions (P=.0004). The majority of cases with the DDX41 defect showed advanced disease (higher-risk MDS and sAML). Cases with lower expression of DDX41 showed a significantly worse OS than those with higher expression (HR=1.6, 95%CI=1.04-2.19). As both twins showed a remarkable responsiveness to lenalidomide despite lack of del(5q), we analyzed an additional 94 pts (MDS,MPN,MDS/MPN) who received lenalidomide for the presence of DDX41 . In lower-risk group pts, those who demonstrated DDX41 locus deletions/ DDX41 mutations showed a significantly higher sensitivity to lenalidomide than those who did not (P=.024). When we compared expression levels of DDX41 in responders (n=10) and refractory patients (n=9), lenalidomide responders showed significantly lower expression of DDX41 (P=.048), indicating a relationship between DDX41 and lenalidomide sensitivity. To study the biological consequences of DDX41 low expression, we knocked down DDX41 expression in leukemic cell lines (HL-60 and K562 cell lines) via lentiviral transduced shRNA. Significantly higher proliferation rates were observed in both DDX41 knockdown cell lines compared to control. Based on a synthetic lethal approach, we used the DDX41 knockdown cells to test the effects of helicase inhibitors (C 14 H 15 N 3 O): DDX41 low expressing cells showed differential sensitivity to helicase inhibitors as compared with control cells. In sum, DDX41 mutant or haploinsuffcient cases are associated with MDS (as a secondary driver) and may signal lenalidomide responsiveness. DDX41 and other helicases represent a novel class of genes found to carry mutations in MDS. DDX41 and possibly other helicases may be targeted by RNA helicase inhibitors.
