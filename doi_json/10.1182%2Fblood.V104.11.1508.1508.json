    "abstract_text": "Background : Thirty to 50% of patients with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia display detectable bone marrow cytogenetic abnormalities at diagnosis with some( Demory et al. Blood  1988 ; 72 : 855 , Dupriez et al. Blood  1996 ; 88 : 1013 , Reilly et al. BJH  1997 ; 98 : 96 ) but not other studies ( Cervantes et al. BJH  1998 ; 102 : 684 , Okamura et al. Int J Hematol  2001 ; 73 : 194 ) suggesting a detrimental effect on survival. Methods : The current prospective study was conducted as a follow-up of the observations from an antecedent retrospective study that identified sole abnormalities of either 13q- or 20q- as \u2018favorable\u2019 to survival ( Tefferi et al. BJH  2001 ; 113 : 763 ). All clinical and laboratory measurements, including bone marrow examination and karyotype analysis, were performed concurrently in consecutive cases of histologically confirmed MMM regardless of either duration of disease or presence of active therapy. Survival, leukemic transformation rate, and clinical progression were determined from the time of cytogenetic analysis. Results : Karyotypic analysis was successfully performed in a total of 88 patients (median age 61 years; 31 females) and the results were normal in 49 (56%) and abnormal in the remaining 39 patients with 9 (10%) displaying \u2018favorable\u2019, and 30 (34%) \u2018other\u2019 clonal abnormalities. At the time of study entry, 57 patients were not recieving any form of therapy, 18 were newly diagnosed, and the Dupriez prognostic score distributions were \u20180\u2019 in 33 patients, \u20181\u2019 in 35 and \u20182\u2019 in 20 ( Dupriez et al. Blood  1996 ; 88 : 1013 ). All patients were followed for a minimum of 3 years and a median of 42 months. The 3 cytogenetic categories were similar in age and gender distribution. Survival in the favorable cytogenetic group was similar to that of the normal group and significantly better than the group with other cytogenetic abnormalities (p=0.02).

In a Cox regression analysis, cytogenetic lesions other than the \u2018favorable\u2019 kind, hemoglobin below 10 g/dL, leukocytosis, hypercatabolic symptoms, increased blood blast %, blood CD 34 count above 100 x 10 6 /L were individually associated with shortened survival. In a multivariate analysis, only hemoglobin level and leukocyte count retained their significance. Conclusion : Single chromosomal abnormalities of either 13q- or 20q- should be considered as \u2018favorable\u2019 cytogenetic lesions in MMM while other abnormalities are associated with an adverse prognosis. The current observation explains the discrepancy in the literature regarding the prognostic relevance of cytogenetic findings in MMM and warrants additional studies to determine the value of incorporating the specific information in prognostic scoring systems."
