    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1150 During plasma coagulation the protease \u03b1-thrombin (\u03b1IIa) cleaves fibrinogen to form a fibrin clot. Conversion of prothrombin to \u03b1IIa is catalyzed by factor (f) Xa, and results in expression of two electropositive regions on \u03b1IIa designated anion binding exosites (ABE) I and II. ABE I is involved in fibrinogen binding. In the presence of fVa and phospholipid, fXa cleaves prothrombin preferentially after Arg320, generating the intermediate meizothrombin (MzIIa), which also expresses ABE I. MzIIa is rapidly converted to \u03b1IIa. \u03b1IIa can be converted to \u03b2-thrombin (\u03b2IIa) and \u03b3-thrombin (\u03b3IIa), both of which are cleaved within ABE I, and have greatly reduced capacity to convert fibrinogen to fibrin. Physiologic functions for \u03b2IIa or \u03b3IIa are not established; however, both have been identified in clotting blood. \u03b1IIa up-regulates its own generation in plasma by converting fXI to the protease fXIa. Yun et al. (J Biol Chem 2003;278:48112) showed that amino acids in ABE I are required for optimal fXI activation in the presence of the polyanion dextran sulfate (DS). MzIIa also activates fXI, consistent with a role for ABE I in protease binding to fXI. Given the absence of ABE I in \u03b2IIa and \u03b3IIa, it seems reasonable to postulate these proteases would interact poorly with fXI. In a clotting assay in which thrombin is added to plasma anticoagulated with citrate (low calcium), \u03b2IIa (12.5 nM) and \u03b3IIa (50 nM) did not induce clot formation, consistent with their low capacity to cleave fibrinogen. However, when plasma was recalcified to allow thrombin to form from endogenous prothrombin, both \u03b2IIa and \u03b3IIa induced clot formation. Recalcified plasma in the absence of \u03b2IIa or \u03b3IIa did not clot (800 sec observation period), indicating fibrin formation was \u03b2IIa/\u03b3IIa-dependent. Addition of an antibody to fXI prolonged the clotting time with \u03b2IIa, and prevented clotting with \u03b3IIa, suggesting \u03b2IIa and \u03b3IIa were activating fXI. In addition, with \u03b3IIa, a fXIIa inhibitor modestly prolonged clotting time, indicating the plasma contact phase was activated. We studied fXI activation by thrombin using western blot. \u03b2IIa and \u03b3IIa activated fXI at approximately half the rate of \u03b1IIa, while MzIIa activated fXI \u223c4 fold faster than \u03b1IIa. FXI activation by \u03b1IIa is greatly enhanced by DS. In the presence of DS, \u03b1IIa and \u03b2IIa activated fXI comparably, while results with \u03b3IIa were not informative because the protease does not interact well with DS. Importantly, fXI activation by \u03b1IIa was not affected by the ABE I blocking peptide hirugen, indicating ABE I is not required for fXI activation by thrombin. While \u03b2IIa and \u03b3IIa were less effective fXI activators than \u03b1IIa and MzIIa in solution, significantly different results were obtained in a plasma thrombin generation assay. Here coagulation is initiated in fXII deficient plasma with thrombin (10 nM), and subsequent thrombin generation from endogenous prothrombin is monitored. The system is fXI-dependent, as a fXI antibody blocks thrombin generation. Prior work with this system indicates fXI is probably converted to fXIa by the thrombin added to initiate the process. Initiation of coagulation with \u03b1IIa and MzIIa resulted in comparable thrombin generation (\u223c250 nM). \u03b2IIa and \u03b3IIa, as well as recombinant \u03b1IIa with mutations in amino acids in ABE I induced thrombin generation \u223c2-fold greater than for \u03b1IIa and MzIIa. We hypothesized this was due to the inability of fibrinogen to compete with fXI for binding to thrombin species lacking ABE I. Consistent with this, hirugen peptide enhanced \u03b1IIa initiated thrombin generation \u223c4-fold. Finally, we followed up on the observation that a fXIIa inhibitor prolonged time to \u03b3IIa-induced clot formation in recalcified plasma. In solution, \u03b3IIa, but not \u03b1IIa, \u03b2IIa, or MzIIa cleaves the contact factors fXII and PK. The cleaved proteases, in turn, are capable of cleaving chromogenic substrates, and have activity in a reciprocal fXII-PK activation assay. Our studies show that ABE I is not required for thrombin-mediated activation of fXI, that thrombin species not fully expressing ABE I may be better than \u03b1IIa and MzIIa as initiators of fXI-dependent thrombin generation in plasma, and that \u03b3IIa can activate the plasma contact proteases. Taken as a whole, the data indicate forms of thrombin other than \u03b1IIa may contribute directly to feedback activation of fXI, and may represent a previously unrecognized link between coagulation and the contact system.
