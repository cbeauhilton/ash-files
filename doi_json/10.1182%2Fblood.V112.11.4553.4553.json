    "abstract_text": "A severe functional deficiency in the ADAMTS13 protease, characteristic for patients suffering from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), results in persisting prothrombotic ultra-large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) multimers, which can lead to systemic microvascular thrombosis. The congenital form of TTP is attributed to the presence of homozygous or double heterozygous mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene leading to impaired secretion and/or a functional defect of the protease. Decreased ADAMTS13 activity has been also described for several physiological and pathological conditions. Emerging evidence indicates mild ADAMTS13 deficiency might also increase risk for arterial thrombosis such as for ischemic stroke. We therefore investigated a possible causal relation between moderate ADAMTS13 deficiency and ischemic stroke in one patient selected with the lowest ADAMTS13 activity amongst a cohort of 70 patients with ischemic stroke. At age 34 and 46 years the patient had suffered from idiopathic ischemic strokes with negative common prothrombotic risk factors. We found slightly elevated VWF antigen (161%), ULVWF multimers and reduced ADAMTS13 activity (17%). Genetic analysis identified five nucleotide exchanges in the ADAMTS13 gene leading to one heterozygous missense mutation P353L and four homozygous amino acid polymorphisms (R7W, Q448E, P618A, A732V). Her asymptomatic son presented with normal VWF antigen (99%) and an ADAMTS13 activity of 58% transmitted by a mutant maternal allele and a paternal allele harboring the single Q448E polymorphism. Recombinant expression studies indicated P353L alone causes an impact on ADAMTS13 secretion that is further pronounced in the context of the four polymorphisms. Secreted ADAMTS13 containing P353L or P353L combined with the four polymorphisms presented with similar binding interaction in a binding assay with immobilized multimeric VWF, however, the binding affinity was slightly less than that of wild-type ADAMTS13 or polymorphic rADAMTS13 proteins containing either Q448E alone or all four polymorphisms combined. ADAMTS13 activity analysis suggested that mainly the secretion process or the protein stability rather than the proteolytic activity was affected by the mutations. Co-transfections mimicking the patient\u2019s genotype indicated homozygosity of the four polymorphisms in the patient led to an attenuation of the adverse effect of the heterozygous P353L point mutation resulting in the moderate ADAMTS13 deficiency in the patient. Our results suggest moderate familial ADAMTS13 deficiency might be causally involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke."
