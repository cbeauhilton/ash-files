    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a complex hematological malignancy with the heterogenous immune bone marrow (BM) environment contributing to tumor growth, drug resistance, and immune escape. T-Cells play a critical role in the clearance of malignant plasma cells from the tumor environment. However, T-Cells in multiple myeloma demonstrate impaired cytotoxicity, proliferation, and cytokine production due to the activation of immune inhibitory receptors from ligands produced by the myeloma cells. In this study, we investigate the behavior of T-Cells in MM patients by using single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) to compare the transcriptomic profiles of BM T-Cells of patients with rapid progressing (FP; PFS < 18mo) and non-progressing (NP; PFS > 4yrs) disease. Methods: Newly diagnosed MM patients (n=18) from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) CoMMpass study (NCT01454297) were identified as either rapid progressors or non-progressors based on their progression free survival since diagnosis. To capture transcriptomic data, scRNA-Seq was performed on 48 aliquots of frozen CD138-negative BM cells at three medical centers/universities (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Washington University in St. Louis, and Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NYC). Samples were collected at diagnosis prior to treatment. Surface marker expression for 29 proteins was captured for at least one sample per patient using CITE-Seq. After integration and batch correction, clustering was performed to identify cells of T or NK lineage. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and differential expression were used to identify T-Lymphoid subtypes, and differences in NP and FP samples. Results: In this study, single cell transcriptomic profiles were identified for ~102,207 cells from 48 samples of 18 MM patients. 40,328 T ( CD3 +) and NK ( CD3 -, NKG7 +) cells were isolated, and subclustered for further analysis (Fig 1A). Using differentially expressed markers for each cluster, the T-Lymphoid subset was refined into seven subtypes, consisting of various CD4+ T-Cells, CD8+ T-Cells, and NK cells (Fig 1B). The CD8+ cells were divided into three distinct phenotypes, namely a GZMK-, GZMB- CD8+ T-Cell cluster, a GZMK+ CD8+ Exhausted T-Cell cluster enriched in TIGIT and multiple chemokines ( CCL3 , CCL4 , XCL2 ), and a GZMB+ NkT cluster enriched in cytolytic markers ( PRF1 , GNLY , NKG7 ) (Fig 1C). Differential expression between NP and FP samples in this CD8+ subset showed enrichment of the NkT cytotoxic markers in NP samples, while FP samples were enriched in the CD8+ Exhausted chemokine markers (Fig 1D). Furthermore, the proportion of CD8+ Exhausted T-Cells was enriched in FP samples (p.val < 0.05) (Fig 1E). Exhaustion markers were measured through both RNA and surface marker levels. In RNA, TIGIT was uniquely associated with the FP-enriched CD8+ Exhausted T-Cell cluster, and CD160 was uniquely expressed in FP samples (Fig 1F). CITE-Seq surface marker expression confirms enrichment of both TIGIT and PD1 in the CD8+ Exhausted T-Cell cluster, and along with more exhaustion in FP samples (p.val < 0.01). Conclusion: In this study, we have identified significant differences in T-Cell activity in patients with non-progressing and rapid-progressing multiple myeloma. T-Cells in rapid progressing patients appear to be in a suppressed state, with low cytolytic activity and enriched exhaustion markers. This GZMK+ T-Cell population shows strong similarities with an aging-associated subtype of effector memory T-Cells found to be enriched in older populations (Mogilenko et al, Immunity 54, 2021). These findings will be further validated in an expanded study, consisting both of a larger number of samples, and multiple samples at different timepoints from the same patient.
