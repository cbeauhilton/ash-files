    "abstract_text": "Objective To analysis the risk factors for affected patients the long-term persistent survival in 96 patients undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, in order to take active prevention and cure measure, and improve trans- plantation curative effect preferably. Methods We retrospectively analysis 96 cases of patients subject to allo- HSCT. The 11 clinical parameters were selected for univariat -e analysis using a Cox regression:age, sex, morbid state, HLA locus, donor type, donor -recipient blood type, conditioning regimen, aGVHD, HC, VOD, IP. Factors that were significant at the 0.1 level on univariate analysis were evaluated by multivariate an- alysis using a Cox regression. The cumulative incidence of aGVHD and patients survival rate were calculated by the method of Kaplan and Meier. Results ninty-five patients achieved sustained donor engraftment except one patients not. The median time of leukocyte engraftment was 13 days. The incidence rates of grades I~IV acute GVHD was 43.75%. grades III~\u2021WaGVHD was 12.50%. Ten patients relapsed and 38 dead, the overall survival at 5 years was 60.42%. The COX method analysis showed that aGVHD and diease states at transplant were significantly risk factors to improved overall survivals(OS), with relative risk [RR] 2.996 and 2.619, respectively. Conclusion aGVHD and diease states at transplant had significantly improved OS, the key to improvement the outcome 0f allo- HSCT is to reduce the incidence and severity of aGVHD, meanwhile selecting the suitable opportunity for transplantation. We had better do HSCT in CR 1 to treat that patients with advance refractory and recurrence."
