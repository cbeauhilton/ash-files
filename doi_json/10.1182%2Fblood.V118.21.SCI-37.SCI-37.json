    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-37 Stem and progenitor cells reside in specialized microenvironments that regulate their function. While some stem/progenitor cells are perivascular, others clearly occupy hypoxic niches and may be regulated by O 2 gradients. We are currently evaluating underlying mechanisms for the impact of O 2 levels on stem and progenitor cells within distinct microenvironments. We have previously shown that neural stem cells within the adult hippocampus are closely associated with low O 2 regions and that hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), a principle mediator of hypoxic adaptations, modulates Wnt-\u03b2 catenin signaling to maintain stem cell proliferation, differentiation, and neuronal maturation. We have extended these findings to other stem cell populations, such as those of adult muscle and bone marrow. Our findings will be presented at this meeting.
