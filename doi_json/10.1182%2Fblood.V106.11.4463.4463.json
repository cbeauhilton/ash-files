    "abstract_text": "The treatment of AML in the elderly population is difficult given the inherent resistant disease, the toxic effects of therapy and the presence of co-morbid conditions. We proposed preclinical studies to investigate the potential synergy of bortezomib with melphalan against AML cells, with the anticipation of developing a clinical trial. To test the killing potential of bortezomib or melphalan, limiting dilution experiments were performed with subsequent analysis using the MTT assay. Two human AML cell lines, GDM-1 and Kasumi-1, were used as targets. Tumor cells (7.5 x 10 3 cells/well) were plated on 96-well tissue culture plates and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . At 24 hrs, varying concentrations of melphalan (doses: 100 uM to 1 uM) or bortezomib (doses: 100 nM to 1 nM) were added to each well. After 48 hrs of culture, the MTT assay was performed. Each test was run in triplicate. When using the GDM-1 cell line, the addition of melphalan alone (1 uM) resulted in 80% viability (+/\u2212 1.7%), while bortezomib alone (1 nM) yielded 86% viability (+/\u2212 3.6%). An increased dose of each medication decreased the viability of the GDM-1 cells. An increased dose of Melphalan (3 uM) reduced the viability to 23% (+/\u2212 4.2 %). The viability dropped to 62% (+/\u2212 4.9 %) with an increased dose of Bortezomib (3 nM). After combining the medications, the inhibitory activity against the GDM-1 cells required lower doses then either drug alone. For example, melphalan (1uM) with bortezomib (1 nM) reduced the viability of GDM-1 cells to 20% (+/\u2212 2.8%); While melphalan (3 uM) and bortezomib (3 nM) further suppressed the viability to 3.7 % (+/\u22122.5 %). Similar results were found using the Kasumi-1 AML cell line. These results demonstrate the potential synergy of the combination of bortezomib with melphalan against AML cells. These preclinical results are currently being tested in a clinical trial using low dose melphalan with bortuzimab in elderly AML and MDS patients.",
