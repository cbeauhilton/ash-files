    "abstract_text": "Objectives The objective of the present study was two fold: first, to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the plasma-derived FIX concentrate AlphaNine\u00ae in patients with congenital severe haemophilia B (FIX:C 2%). To do this, two PK studies were carried out one six months after the first. The second objective was a comparison of the Alphanine\u00ae PK profile with the recombinant Factor IX, BeneFIX\u00ae. Patients and methods The first study was a prospective, five-center, open-label, comparative, PK study carried out in 25 severe hemophilia B patients who received 2 single doses of 65\u201375 IU/kg of AlphaNine\u00ae within 6 months (t=0 and t=6). The following parameters were assessed: in vivo recovery, half-life, AUC, mean residence time and clearance. As an extension of the study, a single dose of 65\u201375 IU/kg of BeneFIX\u00ae was administered in 9 out of 25 patients, after a wash-out period of 7\u201315 days. Results Table 1 summarizes the results obtained when comparing AlphaNine\u00ae within a period of time of 6 months (PK1 vs PK2) in 25 patients. Table 2 shows the results obtained when comparing the in vivo recovery of AlphaNine \u00ae vs BeneFIX \u00ae in the 9 patients studied. Conclusions These results confirm that AlphaNine\u00ae PK has similar profile as other plasma derived FIX products presently available to treat Hemophilia B patients. In addition, our results show that the recombinant FIX studied, BeneFIX\u00ae has a reduced in vivo recovery when is compared to AlphaNine\u00ae. Table 1  Parameter . AlphaNine\u00ae (PK1) t=0 m .
