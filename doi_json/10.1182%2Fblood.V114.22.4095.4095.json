    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4095 Poster Board III-1030 The clinical outcomes of refractory/recurrent leukemia that salvaged by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is usually poor. It is crucial for the management of those high-risk patients with appropriate conditioning regimens that balance the efficacy and safety well and with enhanced anti-leukemia effect post-HCT. Our previous study has shown that donor's dendritic cell-primed cytokine-induced killer cells (DC-CIK) is a safe and effective therapy in the management of early leukemia recurrence after allogeneic HCT, which fail to or ineligible for current standard treatment. Objective In present clinical study, we examine the efficacy of refractory/recurrent myelogenous leukemia salvaged by allogeneic HCT and prophylactic immunotherapy. Methods From September 2006 to May 2008, 30 patients with refractory/recurrent myelogenous leukemia (AML 29, CML-BC 1) were enrolled. The median age was 32 (12 to 55) years old. The median blasts in bone marrow were 36% (20% to 87%) prior to conditioning. The grafts were from HLA identical siblings ( 5), unrelated donors (7), and haploidentical family members (18). Conditioning regiments were individualized according to patients' status as following. Generally, the regimen with high-dose cytarabine plus BUCY2 was used (13 cases). The patients with impaired organ function received above regimen except with fludarabine instead of cyclophosphamide (11 cases). For the recipients with > 40% blasts in bone marrow, melphalan (2 cases) or aclarubicin (1 case) was added into the regimen or FLAG followed by reduced-intensified BUCY2 (3 cases) was employed in order to reduce leukemia burden. Cyclosporine A, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil were administrated for GVHD prophylaxis. To prevent leukemia relapse, immunosuppressants were tapered off early post-HCT. Prophylactic immunotherapy including cellular (DLI, DC-CIK, NK cells), and humoral (IL-2, IFN-a, thymosin) was used selectively in the patients who had no GVHD 120 days after HCT. Results The median mononuclear cells in the graft were 7.36 (3.49 to 11.5) \u00d710 8 /kg. The median CD34 + cells were 4.06 (1.57 to 11.4) \u00d710 6 /kg. The median CD3 + cells were 1.42 (0.75 to 3.61) \u00d710 8 /kg. Twenty-nine patients attained sustained engraftment. One died of multi-organ failure before hematopoietic reconstitution. The median time for white blood cells > 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and platelets > 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L was 14 (10 to 21) days, 15 (12 to 26) days, respectively. Thirteen patients developed acute GVHD (grade I in 5, grade II in 7, and grade III in 1). Thirteen patients developed chronic GVHD after immunosuppressants' reduction or withdrawal. In addition, 13 patients received prophylactic immunotherapy due to lack of chronic GVHD 120 days post-HCT, then 7 of 13 developed chronic GVHD. With the median follow-up of 15 (3 to 35) months, two (6.7%) patients with AML had hematological recurrence. One patient attained durable complete remission again after treatment with chemotherapy followed by immunotherapy with DLI, DC-CIK, and NK cells. Five (16.7%) patients died (infections in 2, hematological relapse in 1, chronic GVHD in 1, and multi-organ failure in 1). 25 of 30 (83.3%) patients have been in continuous complete remission since salvaged HCT. Conclusion Our preliminary clinical results have shown that the combination of salvaged allogeneic HCT and prophylactic immunotherapy is a promising modality for the treatment of myelogenous leukemia in refractory/recurrent status, even with high leukemia burden.
