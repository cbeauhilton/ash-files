    "abstract_text": "B cell development in bone marrow is followed by specification into spleen subsets, including marginal zone (MZ) cells. MZ require elaboration of distinct gene expression programs for development. Given their role in gene regulation, its not surprising that microRNAs (miRNAs) influence cell development. Recent work demonstrated that deficiency of NF-\u03baB feedback regulator, Mir146 (miR-146a), led to a range of hematopoietic phenotypes, but B cells have not been extensively characterized. Here, we found miR-146a deficient mice demonstrate a reduction in MZ B cells, likely from a T cell independent developmental block. Utilizing comparative analysis of developmental stage-specific transcriptomes, we show MZ cell differentiation was impaired due to decreases in Notch2 signaling. Further, we discovered that the cell-fate regulatory protein, Numb, is a direct target of miR-146a, and its derepression in miR-146a deficient B cells underlies the decreases in Notch2. Our studies reveal miR-146a-dependent B cell phenotypes regulated by the Numb-Notch2 pathway. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
