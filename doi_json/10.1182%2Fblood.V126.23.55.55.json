    "abstract_text": "Background Imetelstat is a 13-mer lipid-conjugated oligonucleotide that targets the RNA template of human telomerase reverse transcriptase. A pilot study of imetelstat therapy in myelofibrosis showed the induction of complete (CR) or partial remissions, as well as molecular remissions, in a subset of patients ( Blood. 2014;124:634). In the particular study, CR was significantly higher in patients with SF3B1 or U2AF1 spliceosome mutations, which provided the rationale for the current study; spliceosome mutations are closely associated with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts with (RARS-T) or without (RARS) thrombocytosis ( Leukemia. 2013;27:1826). Methods Diagnosis of RARS and RARS-T was according to WHO criteria ( Blood. 2009;114:937). Study patients were treated with a 2-hour intravenous infusion of 7.5 mg/kg imetelstat (Janssen Biotech Inc., Horsham, PA, USA) every 4 weeks. Drug activity was monitored by both formal response criteria ( Blood. 2006;108:419) and effect on spleen size, thrombocytosis and leukocytosis. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (Version 4.03). Laboratory correlative studies included analysis of mutations. Results Accrual to this signal study is now complete and median time from study registration, as of 5/10/2015, was 17.1 months (range 16.1-20.1). Among the 9 study patients, 5 had RARS-T, 3 had RARS and one had \"MDS/MPN overlap\". Median age was 70 years (78% males). 8 (89%) patients were transfusion-dependent. One patient (RARS-T) had marked splenomegaly (palpable at 16 cm). Three patients each had leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. Seven (78%) patients had received prior treatments, including erythropoiesis stimulating agents in 6 (67%). Baseline international MDS prognostic scoring system scores were intermediate-1 ( n =7) and intermediate-2 ( n =2). Karyotype was normal in all but one patient with loss of Y chromosome. Drug activity Median duration of treatment with imetelstat was 13.7 months (range 6.6-17.9). Three (38%) patients achieved transfusion-independence (TI) during treatment, defined as not requiring transfusions for at least 8 weeks; 2 had RARS and one RARS-T. The median time to TI was 11 weeks (range 9-14) and the median TI duration was 28 weeks (range 9-37). One of the 3 \"TI\" patients also had resolution of leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. A 4 th patient experienced >50% decrease in palpable spleen size as well as a decrease in transfusion need. In addition, imetelstat induced normalization of counts in two additional patients with thrombocytosis and leukocytosis. As of 5/10/2015, 4 (44%) patients remain on active treatment and one death had been recorded (deemed unrelated to imetelstat). The 5 treatment discontinuations were: death during active therapy, discovery of second malignancy, progression into acute leukemia and insufficient response ( n =2). Safety Treatment-emergent grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were seen in 2 (22%) and 1 (11%) patients, respectively; neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were seen in 4 (44%), and 2 (22%) patients. Grade 3 anemia was seen in 6 (67%) of the patients, however baseline grade 2 anemia was noted in 2 (22%) and grade 3 in 3 (30%) patients. None of the grade \u22653 hematologic toxicities lasted \u22654 weeks.. The following grade 3 non-hematologic events occurred in 1 subject: aspiration, fatigue, and lipase increase and a patient with pre-existing cardiovascular disease history experienced a grade 5 heart failure. Treatment-emergent liver function test abnormalities affected: ALT (grade 1 56%/grade 2 11%), AST (grade 1 56%/grade 2 11%), ALP (grade 1 33%), and total bilirubin (grade 2 11%). For patients that discontinued treatment with imetelstat, these events were mostly reversible. Mutation studies Patients were screened for mutations involving JAK2 , SF3B1 , U2AF1 and SRSF2 . Three patients were mutated for JAK2 , 7 for SF3B1 (4 K700E, 2 H662Q, one K666N) and one for U2AF1 (Q157P). All three patients with \"TI\" (H662Q, K700E, K666N) and the 4 th patient with spleen response (K700E) were SF3B1 mutated. Post-treatment analysis showed no effect of imetelstat on mutations. Conclusions Treatment with imetelstat may offer clinical benefit in patients with RARS or RARS-T with generally acceptable safety profile and warrants further clinical investigation.
