    "abstract_text": "Background : Expression of ZAP-70 protein has been shown to be correlated with mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IgVH) genes, a major prognostic factor in CLL. We investigated whether the detection of ZAP-70 protein by flow cytometric analysis using unconjugated and conjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could be applied securely in the workup of patients with CLL. Methods: Flow cytometric analysis of ZAP-70 protein was performed using the method described by Crespo et al ( N Engl J Med  2003 ; 348 : 1764 ) with minor modifications. Both fresh and cryopreserved mononuclear cells from CLL patients and healthy donors were fixed and permeabilized using Fix and Perm kit (Caltag Laboratories), incubated with anti-ZAP-70 mAb (clone 2F3.2, Upstate Biotechnology) and then revealed with goat antimouse FITC mAb (Immunotech). Finally cells were incubated with CD3-APC, CD56-APC and CD19-PC5. We also tested 3 mAbs conjugated to various fluorochromes: 2F3.2-FITC (Upstate), 1E7.2-PE (eBioscience), 1E7.2-PE or -Alexa 488 (Caltag). ZAP-70 protein detection in B-cells was expressed either as a percentage of its expression in the T and NK-cells or as a ratio (R) of T-cell mean cell fluorescence (MCF) to B-cell MCF. Western blotting of protein lysates from purified B-cells was carried out to control results obtained by cytometry in 55 samples. Mutational status was defined using a cutoff of 98%. Results: In 13 healthy donors, the mean percentage of ZAP-70 protein expression obtained by flow cytometry with unconjugated mAb (clone 2F3.2) was 4.69% \u00b1 1.93 [range 2\u20139%] and the R ratio was 6.64 \u00b1 1.54 and > 4.8. In 83 B-CLL samples, ZAP-70 expression was determined using the same method and compared to IgVH mutational status. Results in table below show a 75% concordance between gene mutations and ZAP-70 expression when considering a percentage of positive B-cells > 20%. A better concordance (81%) is obtained with a threshold T-cell MCF/ B-cell MCF at 4 determined by Youden\u2019s index. To note the high concordance (90%) between unmutated status and ZAP-70 + expression (19/21). Comparison with at least 1 of the 3 conjugated mAbs has been performed for 63 samples, with discordant results in our laboratories.  . 62 mutated IgVH samples . 21 unmutated IgVH samples . ZAP-70 B-Cells + \u2264 20 % : 43 > 20% : 19 T-cell MCF/B-cell MCF \u2265 4 : 48 < 4 : 19 . 62 mutated IgVH samples . 21 unmutated IgVH samples . ZAP-70 B-Cells + \u2264 20 % : 43 > 20% : 19 T-cell MCF/B-cell MCF \u2265 4 : 48 < 4 : 19 View Large Conclusions: Our data document the concordance between IgVH gene mutational status and ZAP-70 protein expression measured by flow cytometry, particularly in ZAP-70 negative samples. We found that the indirect method of labelling with unconjugated anti-ZAP-70 mAb remains until now, in our hands, the gold standard method compared to the available dyes conjugate mAbs."
