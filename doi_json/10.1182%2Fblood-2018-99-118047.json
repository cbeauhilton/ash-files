    "abstract_text": "Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) often achieve remission but subsequently die of relapse driven by chemotherapy resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs). To initiate and maintain cancer, LSCs must also escape immunosurveillance. However, in vivo studies on human LSCs largely disregard lymphocyte mediated anti-tumor immunity due to the use of immunocompromised mice. Here we investigate the immunosurveillance mediated by NKG2D, a danger detector expressed by cytotoxic lymphocytes such as natural killer (NK) cells that recognizes stress-induced ligands (NKG2DL) of the MIC and ULBP protein families on AML cells. Staining of n=175 de novo AML with antibodies against MICA, MICB and ULB2/5/6 or an NKG2D-Fc chimeric protein recognizing pan-NKG2DL expression revealed NKG2DL to heterogeneously express among leukemic cells of the same patient ( Fig. 1a ). As expected, NKG2DL pos AML cells were efficiently cleared by natural killer (NK) cells, while NKG2DL neg leukemic cells escaped NK cell lysis. Interestingly, these NKG2DL neg AML cells also showed immature morphology, enhanced in vitro clonogenicity (39\u00b147 colonies vs. 1\u00b14, p<0.001, n=32 AML cases) and selective abilities to initiate leukemia in NSG mice devoid of functional NK cells (NKG2DL neg , 33/35, 94%; NKG2DL pos , 0/35, 0%; p<0.001, n=13 AML cases, Fig. 1b ) and to survive chemotherapy in vivo . In mice, NKG2DL neg AML cells generated both NKG2DL pos and NKG2DL neg progeny of which again only latter induced leukemia in re-transplant assays. Even though similar leukemia-specific mutations were retrieved in NKG2DL neg and NKG2DL pos AML cells derived from the same patient (n=12 analysed patients), published LSC, HSC and 17-genes stemness score signatures were specifically enriched in NKG2DL neg fractions. Mechanistically, expression of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) was identified as enriched in NKG2DL neg compared to NKG2DL pos leukemic subpopulations, and PARP1 inhibition (PARPi) using either siRNAs or pharmacological inhibitors such as AG-14361, veliparib, talazoparib or olaparib, increased NKG2DL mRNA transcripts between 6 and >50 fold. PARP1 binding sites were identified by in silico analysis in NKG2DL promoters and binding was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation in the promoters of MICA and MICB. Importantly, treatment with PARPi induced NKG2DL surface expression on LSCs in vitro and in vivo and co-treatment with PARPi and NK cells efficiently suppressed leukemogenesis in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models ( Fig. 1c ). These data suggest that PARP1 inhibition sensitizes LSCs to NK cell mediated elimination. Finally, NKG2DL surface expression was found to inversely correlate with favorable molecular AML characteristics (favorable ELN risk group vs. other: p=0.034; inv(16) versus other: p=0.023), complete remission rates after induction chemotherapy (all patients: p=0.002, patients <65 years: p=0.004) and patient overall survival (patients <65 years: p=0.028). Enhanced PARP1 expression in leukemic cells furthermore associated with poor clinical outcome (TCGA data set, p=0.0038). In summary, our data link the concept of LSCs to immune escape in human AML and propose the absence of immunostimulatory NKG2DL as a novel method to identify LSCs across genetic AML subtypes (including CD34 negative AMLs). This LSC specific mechanism of immune evasion could be overcome by treatment with PARP1 inhibitors, which in conjunction with functional NK cells holds promise to eradicate LSCs and promote immune-mediated cure of AML. Fig. 1: Human AML contain NKG2DL pos as well as NKG2DL neg subpopulations but only latter display leukemia initiation capacity (a: left, analysis of n=175 AML cases using NKG2D-Fc staining, right: exemplary flow cytometry plots; b: leukemic infiltration and survival in mice transplanted with NKG2DL neg or NKG2DL pos AML cells sorted from the same AML cases). PARP1 inhibition with AG-14361 up-regulates NKG2DL on CD34 + LSCs, and in vivo co-treatment with AG-14361 and polyclonal allogeneic NK cells suppresses leukemogenesis in PDX models (c). Figure.
