    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4444 Background: Dasatinib is highly potent BCR-ABL inhibitor, with 325-fold higher potency than imatinib and a 16-fold higher potency than nilotinib in vitro . Across a series of phase II and III trials with more than 2 years of follow-up, dasatinib has demonstrated durable efficacy in patients with CML following resistance or intolerance to imatinib. We conducted a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dasatinib in patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance in the Japanese population. Methods: 54 CML- CP patients (median age 63.5 years) with resistance, intolerance or a suboptimal response to imatinib were submitted to dasatinib 100mg once daily. Efficacy and safety were assessed using rates of major molecular response (MMR)/ complete molecular response (CMR) or drug-related adverse events (AEs) respectively. All analyses were based on the intension-treat principle. Results: Until now, the results of 32 patients, who passed more than 12 months, have been analysed. The median time since of prior imatinib therapy was 19.2 months with 57.4 % being imatinib-resistant and 42.6 % imatinib-intolerant. The incidence of MMR (primary endopoint) and complete molecular response at 12 months was 59.3 % (95% confidence interval, 45.0 \u2013 72.4 %), and 24.1 % patients, respectively. Progression to the accelerated or blastic phase had not been observed. All patients with baseline samples tested for mutations, and different mutations were not observed. Non-hematological AEs were mostly grade 1/2. Grade 3/4 non-hematological AEs were infrequent, including increased AST (1.9%), and increased creatinine (1.9%), respectively. Grade 1/2 fluid retention adverse events were shown in 10 patients, including 2 patients with edema, and 9 patients with pleural effusion. Grade 3/4 hematological toxicities including anemia (1.9%), neutropenia (14.8%), and thrombocytopenia (9.3 %) were shown, and 13 patients have permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse effects. Conclusions: Dasatinib treatment results in high rate of molecular response in CML-CP patients with resistance or intolerance to imatinib, and approximately 60% of evaluated patients who switched to dasatinib achieved MMR at 12 months. Importantly, among all patients who achieved molecular response, 24.1 % patients achieved CMR. Dasatinib at a dose of 100 mg once daily was generally well-tolerated, and had better efficacy for patients with CML-CP post imatinib failure.
