Information on CML treatment adherence and impact on quality of life (QoL) has been captured in the context of clinical trials with QoL being measured using generic measures. Very little is known about patient experience of CML and CML treatment in the real-world setting. Objective: To assess the impact of CML and CML treatment on daily productivity, quality of life and treatment adherence, from the patienta\u0302|CE\u2122s perspective. Method: In a pilot survey, twenty patients diagnosed with CML described their experiences in single 45 minute interviews conducted via telephone. Eligible patients included adults (>18 years) diagnosed with chronic phase CML and either currently on oral treatment for their CML or on drug holiday. Questions included in the pilot survey addressed overall treatment satisfaction, ease/burden of daily treatments and impact of treatment on daily activities. A preliminary analysis of 16 patients included in the pilot study was conducted. Results: Mean patient age was 52.9 years (SD = 12.6), 56.3% were male, averaged 3.1 years since diagnosis (SD = 3.1). Patientsa\u0302|CE\u2122 satisfaction with their oral CML treatment was high (mean 9.3 on a scale of 1 \u2013 10, where 1 = not at all satisfied and 10 = very satisfied, SD = 1.3) among the 14 patients who provided a score. Perception of having a favorable response to treatment was also high (14/16). While patients reported good adherence to their treatment regimens, 9/16 patients mentioned missing doses of their CML treatment. Constitutional symptoms of treatment were reported as a daily occurrence by 50% of patients (8/16). Conclusion: In this pilot survey of the CML patienta\u0302|CE\u2122s perspective, high patient satisfaction with oral CML treatments was primarily attributable to a high overall response to treatment. Willingness to adapt to certain aspects of CML treatment was high given that treatment was perceived as being life-saving. Understanding factors which could minimize the impact on daily activities is important as new treatment options become available. Results from this pilot survey will inform the content of a self-administered questionnaire to include an expanded cohort of CML patients (n=300) within the US and Europe.
