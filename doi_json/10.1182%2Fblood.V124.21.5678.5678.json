    "abstract_text": "While multiple myeloma (MM) is almost invariably preceded by asymptomatic monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and/or smoldering MM (SMM), the alterations of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment that establish progression to symptomatic disease are circumstantial. Our aim was to identify changes in the BM microenvironment eliciting angiogenesis in MM. We have found that in Vk*MYC mice harboring oncogene-driven plasma cell proliferative disorder, the progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic MM was characterized by substantial modifications of the BM microenvironment, including a switch from a T helper type 1 (Th1) to a Th2 response, and accumulation of CD206 + Tie2 + macrophages, which eventually favored angiogenesis and increased in microvessel density (MVD). Notably, MVD was also increased at diagnosis in the BM of MGUS and SMM patients that subsequently progressed to MM when compared with MGUS and SMM that remained quiescent. These findings suggest a multistep pathogenic process in MM, in which the immune system may contribute to angiogenesis and disease progression. They also suggest investigating MVD in asymptomatic patients as prognostic factor for the progression and outcome of this disease. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
