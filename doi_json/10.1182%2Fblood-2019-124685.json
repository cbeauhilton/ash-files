    "abstract_text": "Genetic mutations in FLT3 (fms-like tyrosine kinase-3) play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FLT3 internal tandem duplications ( FLT3 -ITD) occur in approximately 25% of all AML cases and various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting FLT3 -ITD such as quizartinib, crenolanib, and gilteritinib have been developed. Although these selective FLT3 inhibitors were thought to be promising, their effects turned out to be temporary due to the rapid development of resistance associated with clonal switching. Acquired FLT3 point mutations at D835 in the activation loop of tyrosine kinase domain are often accountable for clonal switching at least for Type II TKIs. In addition, adjunct mutations in other genes are also found to be associated with TKI resistance. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of this secondary, mutation-driven acquired resistance, we first analyzed co-occurring mutations in the leukemia cells obtained from 26 AML patients with FLT3 -ITD (n=14) or FLT3 -ITD/D835 dual (n=12) mutations, and performed cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) sequencing, which identifies and quantifies the 5' ends of capped mRNA transcripts (transcription start sites) and allows investigating promoter structures necessary for gene expression. Patients with FLT3 -ITD/D835 harbored a higher number of co-mutations such as ASXL1 and RUNX1 compared to AML with FLT3 -ITD ( FLT3 -ITD/D835: 2.83 \u00b1 0.52, FLT3 -ITD: 0.49 \u00b1 0.13, p<0.0001). Intriguingly, CAGE detected significantly higher expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family genes BCL2 and BCL2A1 in FLT3 -ITD/D835 compared to FLT3 -ITD mutant primary samples. Specifically, the CAGE peak of BCL2 was highest in samples with FLT3 -ITD/D835 alone (p<0.01), while the CAGE peak of BCLA1 was highest in samples with FLT3 -ITD/D835 and co-mutations compared with the other samples (p=0.01). To recapitulate the observations obtained with primary human AML samples, we generated MV4;11 cells with acquired FLT3 -ITD/D835 mutations (MV4;11-QR cells) by culturing FLT3 -ITD MV4;11 leukemia cells in the presence of quizartinib (1.5 nM), a selective FLT3 inhibitor, for 6 months. While quizartinib (0.2 nM) suppressed the proliferation of 50% of the parental MV4;11 at 72 hours, much higher concentrations of quizartinib (10 nM) was required to suppress the proliferation of MV4;11-QR cells. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis revealed that MV4;11-QR cells expressed higher transcript and protein levels of BCL2A1 than MV4;11 parental cells, while BCL2 levels were similar in both cells and MCL1 and BCLxL expression were lower in the MV4;11-QR than in the parental cells. Next, to investigate the molecular properties of AML cells bearing FLT3 -ITD or FLT3 -ITD/D835 without other co-mutations, we created Ba/F3 cells stably expressing FLT3 -ITD or FLT3 -ITD/D835. Of notes, the FLT3 -ITD/D835 Ba/F3 cells expressed markedly higher BCL2 transcript and protein levels with lower expression of BCLxL than in FLT3 -ITD Ba/F3 cells. No significant difference of MCL1 expression was observed. The sensitivity to quizartinib was massively decreased in the FLT3 -ITD/D835 Ba/F3 cells (IC50: FLT3 -ITD/D835 >1000nM vs. FLT3 -ITD, 0.8nM, at 48h). Finally, we examined the efficacy of the BCL-2 specific inhibitor venetoclax in FLT3 -ITD/D835 dual mutated cells with or without upregulation of BCL2 or BCL2A1, the latter shown to confer resistance to venetoclax by sequestering released BIM (Esteve-Arenys, Oncogene. 2018). As expected, venetoclax caused more profound cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in BCL2 upregulated FLT3 -ITD/D835 Ba/F3 compared to FLT3 -ITD Ba/F3 cells (IC50: FLT3 -ITD/D835 301nM vs. FLT3 -ITD >1000 nM, 96 h). However, FLT3 -ITD/D835 bearing MV4;11-QR cells with upregulated BCL2A1 were less sensitive to venetoclax than MV4;11 parental cells (IC50: MV4;11-QR, 149nM vs. MV4;11, 33 nM, 72 h). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that acquisition of D835 mutation in FLT3 -ITD mutated AML is often accompanied with multiple co-occurring genetic mutations, and depends on anti-apoptotic BCL-2 associated pro-survival mechanisms. BCL2A1 upregulation might be involved in pathogenesis of acquired drug resistance of FLT3 -ITD/D835 dual mutant AML cells, and is a promising new target in FLT3 -ITD/D835 refractory AML with complex mutations.
