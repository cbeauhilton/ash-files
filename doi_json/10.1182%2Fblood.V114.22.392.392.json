    "abstract_text": "Abstract 392 DNA methylation is essential for development and plays crucial roles in a variety of biological processes. The DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 serves to maintain parental cell methylation patterns on daughter DNA strands in mitotic cells, however, the precise role of Dnmt1 in regulation of quiescent adult stem cells is not known. To examine the role of Dnmt1 in adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we crossed Dnmt1 fl/fl mice with Mx1 -Cre transgenic mice, and by injection of poly(I)-poly(C) we selectively deleted Dnmt1 in the hematopoietic system (Dnmt1 \u0394/\u0394 ). In Dnmt1 \u0394/\u0394 mice, peripheral blood counts and mature multilineage composition of the bone marrow was found to be normal. Interestingly, specific defects were observed in Dnmt1 \u0394/\u0394 HSC self-renewal as assessed by long-term and secondary competitive transplantation, in retention of Dnmt1 \u0394/\u0394 HSCs within the bone marrow niche, and in the ability of Dnmt1 \u0394/\u0394 HSCs to give rise to multilineage hematopoiesis. Loss of Dnmt1 also had unique impact on myeloid progenitor cells (including common myeloid progenitors, granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, and megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors), regulating their cycling and transcriptional lineage fidelity. To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these defects, we performed global gene expression microarray analysis and bisulfite sequencing of select loci ( IAP , Car1 , and Gata1 ) in purified populations of control and Dnmt1 \u0394/\u0394 long-term HSCs, short-term HSCs/multipotent progenitor cells, and myeloid restricted progenitor cells. Through this approach, we demonstrate that loss of Dnmt1 has cell type-specific molecular consequences. For example, demethylation of the Car1 and Gata1 loci in Dnmt1 \u0394/\u0394 long-term HSCs is not sufficient to activate gene transcription, whereas demethylation of these genes in Dnmt1 \u0394/\u0394 short-term HSCs is associated with activation of transcription. In Dnmt1 \u0394/\u0394 myeloid restricted progenitor cells, we observed increases in DNA methylation at specific gene loci such as Car1 , indicating that methylation can be established by other methyltransferases in the absence of Dnmt1. Our global gene expression microarray analysis clearly demonstrates that Dnmt1 regulates expression of distinct gene families in these closely related, primitive hematopoietic populations. We were unable to attribute specific functional defects in Dnmt1 \u0394/\u0394 hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to alterations in expression of previously characterized genes, supporting the existence of novel, uncharacterized regulators of HSC and progenitor cell function to be explored from candidates in our data set. We conclude that maintenance methylation induced by Dnmt1 appears to be especially important for HSC and progenitor cell state transitions, such as the stepwise differentiation of long-term HSCs to multipotent progenitors, multipotent progenitors to myeloid restricted progenitors, stem cell mobilization, and regulating cell cycle entry. These findings establish a unique and critical role for Dnmt1 in the primitive hematopoietic compartment. Furthermore, our evidence suggests that epigenetic regulation, at least with respect to DNA methylation, of adult stem cells is distinct from embryonic stem cells and other somatic cell types.
