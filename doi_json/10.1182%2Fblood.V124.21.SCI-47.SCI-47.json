    "abstract_text": "Progenitor (pro-) and precursor (pre-) B cells express the recombination-activating gene (RAG1/RAG2) endonuclease, which initiates the V(D)J recombination reaction that assembles Immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and light (IgL) chain variable region exons from germline gene segments. Expression of productively assembled IgH \u03bc chains and IgL (Ig\u03ba or Ig\u03bb) chains generates IgM molecules that form the B-cell antigen binding receptor (BCR) with a diverse primary repertoire of binding specificities. As the newly assembled and expressed IgM interacts with local antigens, RAG expression can continue, allowing continued Ig\u03ba V(D)J recombination that can replace the previously assembled V\u03baJ\u03ba exon with one that generates a new specificity. This \"receptor editing\" process provides an antigen-mediated regulatory checkpoint that helps shape the pre-immune BCR repertoire. As the principal location of early B-cell development, the bone marrow antigenic environment is the main force affecting receptor editing. However, the extent to which self-antigens outside of the bone marrow \u2014 as well as environmental antigens \u2014 may shape the primary Ig repertoire is not known. Here we show that early B-cell development takes place in peripheral sites, including the small intestinal mucosa, in young mice. Cells in these sites co-express RAG with cytoplasmic Ig\u03ba and Ig\u03bc, indicating active receptor editing; and, correspondingly, they have significant differences in V\u03ba usage compared to RAG2-expressing bone marrow B-lineage cells and other RAG2-expressing B-lineage cells from other peripheral sites. In addition, the luminal microbial environment appears to also affect Ig\u03bb/Ig\u03ba ratios. We conclude that early B-cell development can occur in the periphery, including the intestinal mucosa, where commensal microbes may influence BCR diversification and gut pre-immune Ig repertoires.
