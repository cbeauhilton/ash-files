    "abstract_text": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate diverse cellular processes in development, differentiation and malignancy. In human cells, over 80% of the lncRNAs contain retrotransposon sequences transcribed from Alu, L1 and LTR retrotransposons, which comprise ~40% of the human genome. The functional significance of the retrotransposon lncRNAs is largely unknown. The human genome contains ~4000 copies of the ERV-9 LTR retrotransposon, which exhibits strong enhancer activity and initiates synthesis of ERV-9 lncRNAs in erythroid progenitor cells. Recently, we discovered that depletion of the ERV-9 lncRNAs in human erythroid progenitor cells cultured ex vivo from peripheral blood CD34+ cells inhibited ex vivo erythropoiesis. Whole genome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) found that depletion of ERV-9 lncRNAs significantly suppressed transcription of 608 genes including ~50 key erythroid genes. We hypothesize that the ERV-9 lncRNAs together with the ERV-9 LTR act in cis to regulate transcription of these key erythroid genes and other genes to set up a transcriptional network that promotes erythropoiesis. In the human b-globin gene locus, we showed previously that the ERV-9 LTR retrotransposon performs a beneficial biological function: The ERV-9 LTR enhancer binds NF-Y and GATA-1 and -2 to assemble an LTR-pol II transcription complex, which transcribes long, noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) from the LTR R-U5 regions through the downstream locus control region (LCR) and intergenic DNAs to reach and activate transcription of b-globin gene 70 kb away. In this tracking and transcription (T&T) mechanism of long-range LTR enhancer function, the ERV-9 lncRNAs could be merely by-products of the tracking and transcribing process of the LTR complex without any functional significance. However, we found recently that depletion of the ERV-9 lncRNAs suppressed transcription of the entire human globin gene locus, diminished occupancies of NF-Y, GATA-1 and -2 and pol II at the ERV-9 LTR and reduced the looping frequency of the ERV-9 LTR with the globin gene locus in erythroid progenitor cells. Thus, the ERV-9 lncRNAs acted in cis to facilitate assembly of the LTR-pol II complex and modulate long-range LTR enhancer function in transcriptional activation of b-globin gene. Genome-wide, whether the ERV-9 lncRNAs transcribed from other gene loci perform similar biological function is under investigation. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
