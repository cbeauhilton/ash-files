    "abstract_text": "Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) and remains incurable. Retinoid is a collective term for compounds, which bind to and activate retinoic acid receptors (RAR\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and RXR\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), members of nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. It is involved in cell differentiation, morphogenesis, proliferation, and anti-neoplastic processes. The most important endogenous retinoid is all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), which is an RAR\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 ligand. ATRA and its mimics have been in clinical use for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Many synthetic retinoids have been developed and attempts to improve their medicinal properties have been made. Among them, a novel synthetic retinoid, Am80 (Tamibarotene) is an RAR\u03b1- and RAR\u03b2-specific (but RAR\u03b3- and RXRs-nonbinding) synthetic retinoid that is expected to overcome ATRA resistance, because of several times more potent differentiation activity than ATRA and sustained plasma level during continuous administration due to a lower affinity for cellular retinoic acid binding protein. On this background, we examined the inhibitory effect of Am80 on HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells. Am80 showed little growth inhibition of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but it markedly inhibited the growth of both HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells. Am 80 could arrest cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and induced apoptosis in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines. The NF-\u03baB pathway is critical for the immortalization and survival of HTLV-I-infected T cells. Therefore, NF-\u03baB pathway was examined as potential targets of Am80 signaling. Am80 significantly inhibited phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB-DNA binding, in conjunction with the reduction of expression of proteins involved in the G1-S cell cycle transition and apoptosis. Furthermore, in animal studies, treatment with Am80 produced partial inhibition of growth of tumors of an HTLV-I-infected T-cell line transplanted subcutaneously in severe combined immunodeficient mice. These findings clearly demonstrate that Am80 is a potential inhibitor of NF-\u03baB in ATL cells, and might be a useful therapeutic agent against ATL.",
