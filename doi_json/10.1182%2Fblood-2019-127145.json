    "abstract_text": "Background: Decreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is associated with R/R large B cell lymphoma. TRANSCEND NHL 001 is an open-label, multicenter, multicohort, seamless design phase 1 study in adult pts with R/R B cell NHL receiving liso-cel, an investigational, anti-CD19, defined composition, 4-1BB, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell product administered at a target dose of CD4+ and CD8+ CAR T cells (NCT02631044). In the diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cohort of TRANSCEND NHL 001, patient-reported outcomes were evaluated using the validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), which assesses HRQoL and symptom burden, and the EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L; health state index score comprising the EQ-5D and EQ-visual analog scale [VAS]), which assesses health utility impact of liso-cel. Methods: Eligible pts in the DLBCL cohort with R/R DLBCL not otherwise specified (including transformed from any indolent lymphoma), high-grade B cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (double/triple hit), primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, or follicular lymphoma grade 3B (aged \u226518 years, \u22652 prior therapy lines) received lymphodepletion followed by liso-cel infusion. The EORTC QLQ-C30 (scored from 1-100; higher scores indicate improved HRQoL or higher symptom burden) and EQ-5D-5L (EQ-5D, scored from 0 to 1, and EQ-VAS, scored from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate improved health) questionnaires were completed at baseline (BL; prior to liso-cel infusion), Day 29 (Month 1), and Months 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 postinfusion. HRQoL was evaluated using prespecified EORTC QLQ-C30 domains of interest: global health status, physical functioning, fatigue, and pain. The remaining EORTC QLQ-C30 domains were analyzed as exploratory. A change of \u226510 points (increase for functional/health status and decrease for symptoms) on the scale score from BL was considered clinically meaningful (ie, a change that a patient would identify as important). The proportions of pts with clinically meaningful change (ie, 10-point improvement or worsening) in prespecified domains of the EORTC QLQ-C30 were calculated based on change scores from BL to Months 6 and 12. Additionally, mean change from BL was calculated for the health state index score (EQ-5D) and EQ-VAS from the EQ-5D-5L. Results: At data cut-off, 181 of 268 pts (mean age, 60 years) were evaluable for the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire and 186 pts (mean age, 60 years) were evaluable for the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. For prespecified domains of interest in the EORTC QLQ-C30, mean scores in global health status showed improvement from Months 1 to 12 compared to BL, while physical functioning declined at Month 1, followed by improvements compared to BL at Months 2 to 12. Reported fatigue symptom burden remained similar at Month 1 followed by improvement from Months 2 to 12 postinfusion compared to BL ( Table ). Although mean pain symptoms were consistently lower from Months 1 to 12 compared to BL, mean symptom burden fluctuated. The mean change from BL score ranged between 4.3 to 16.9 in global health status, \u22124.8 to 6.5 in physical functioning, \u221215.5 to 0.0 for fatigue, and \u22128.8 to \u22121.8 in pain scores through Month 12. Compared to the US general population, based on the EORTC QLQ-C30 reference values, pts in the study had comparable mean EORTC QLQ-C30 scores for most of the domains at BL, which were maintained or improved through Month 12. A notable proportion of pts demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement at Months 6 and 12 in global health status (52% and 61%), physical functioning (30% and 37%), fatigue (53% and 61%), and pain (35% and 47%), respectively. Mean EQ-5D-5L US-based health utility index scores decreased 1 month after liso-cel infusion, which was followed by fluctuations in scores between Months 2 and 3 then an improvement from Months 6 to 12 compared to BL. Mean EQ-VAS scores improved from Months 1 to 12 compared to BL. Conclusions: In TRANSCEND NHL 001, pts in the DLBCL cohort experienced an improvement in HRQoL and health utility through Month 12, though some reported a detriment at Month 1. Reduced fatigue and pain symptom burden through Month 12 after liso-cel infusion was also reported. Overall, in spite of the limitations inherent in the study, a notable proportion of pts demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements at Months 6 and 12.
