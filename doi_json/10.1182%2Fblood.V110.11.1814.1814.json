    "abstract_text": "Overactivity of eukaryotic initiation factor-alpha (eIF2\u03b1) has been shown to be oncogenic and induces malignant transformation. Here we investigated the regulation and the role of eIF2\u03b1 in the terminal differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. We found that all- trans -retinoic acid (ATRA) and other granulocytic differentiation inducers, such as dimethylsulfoxide and arsenic trioxide inhibited activity of eIF2\u03b1 by inducing serine 51 phosphorylation in promyelocytic leukemia cells (NB4). In contrast, activity of eIF2\u03b1 was unaffected during ATRA-induced monocytic differentiation of U937 and THP-1 myelomonocytic cells and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced monocytic/macrophagic differentiation of NB4 cells. Knockdown of eIF2\u03b1 by RNA interference (siRNA) significantly inhibited (p<0.05) ATRA-induced differentiation, indicating that eIF2\u03b1 is critical for the induction of granulocytic differentiation. ATRA-induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was correlated with the expression and activity/phosphorylation (Thr505 and Ser643) of protein kinase C\u03b4 (PKC\u03b4) and eIF2a kinase PKR (Thr446). The specific PKC\u03b4 inhibitor Rottlerin significantly reduced phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, activity of PKR and blocked ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation of NB4 cells (p<0.05). Knockdown of PKC\u03b4 by siRNA decreased PKR activity and increased eIF2\u03b1 activity while knockdown of PKR increased eIF2\u03b1 activity. We also observed that PKC\u03b4 regulates eIF2a activity in normal CD34+ bone marrow progenitor cells and breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we found that eIF2\u03b1 regulated the expression and activity of important targets of ATRA, including c-myc, p21 Waf1/Cip1 , DAP5, GADD153, ATF-2, TG2, and p-P70S6K. In conclusion, our findings indicate that ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells is regulated by PKC\u03b4 through the activity of eIF2\u03b1, revealing a novel mechanism of granulocytic cell differentiation.
