    "abstract_text": "Antiplasmin cleaving enzyme (APCE) is a proteinase that specifically, but slowly cleaves the Pro-Asn bond in long-form \u03b1 2 -antiplasmin (Met-\u03b1 2 AP) in human plasma. This slow cleavage produces a steady-state plasma mixture of Met-\u03b1 2 AP and an N-terminally shortened form of antiplasmin, Asn-\u03b1 2 AP. The Asn-\u03b1 2 AP form crosslinks to fibrin ~13-fold faster than Met-\u03b1 2 AP. A faster crosslink rate causes a greater number of antiplasmin molecules to become bound during fibrin formation, thereby enhancing resistance to fibrinolysis. Inhibition of plasma APCE may decrease the number of antiplasmin molecules crosslinked and result in clots that are more easily removed during fibrinolysis. Therefore, an inhibitor specific for APCE could potentially be used to regulate fibrinolysis. Human Met-\u03b1 2 AP exists in two polymorphic forms at position six in the mature sequence, with arginine predominant, and tryptophan accounting for a lesser percentage. We have determined the relative cleavage rates of synthetic peptides from a peptide library that span the cleavage site. The peptides contained all common amino acids except cysteine in the polymorphic position (P7 position). Arg was the optimal amino acid in this position with a relative cleavage rate ~5\u201310-fold faster than other amino acids except Lys, which was ~70% of the Arg rate. The P7 position Arg enhancement was also observed when Arg was in the P6 or P5 position, but no enhancement was observed when Arg was moved to positions P8, P4, P3 or P2. It was also determined that APCE is preferentially an endoproteinase rather than an aminodipeptidase, with a 10-fold greater rate of hydrolysis of the internal Pro-Asn bond in the Met-\u03b1 2 AP 1\u201317 peptide sequence MEPLGRQLTSGP-NQEQV over the Pro-Asn bond penultimate to the amino-terminal bond in the Met-\u03b1 2 AP 11\u201327 peptide sequence GP-NQEQVSPLTLLKLGN in peptide hydrolysis experiments. We conclude that APCE inhibitors designed with a positive charge placed upstream of the Pro-X scissile bond equivalent to five to seven amino acid residues may prove to be highly potent and specific. In addition, such inhibitors should also prove useful for blocking the activity of the closely related enzyme fibroblast activation protein. This work was supported by NIH grant HL072995."
