    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disorder characterized by a proliferation of malignant monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM) and / or in extramedullary sites. Despite recent progress in OS rates, MM remains an incurable disease and most patients will relapse and require treatment. Deptor is a component of mTOR complexes and a constitutive inhibitor of their activities. It is known that the inhibition of Deptor results in the inhibition of the proliferation and induction of apoptosis in MM cells. In addition, high levels of Deptor are predictive of a poor response to conventional therapies, indicating that Deptor expression are important as a prognostic marker for patients with myeloma and is a possible therapeutic target. Our group previously identified a drug which prevents mTOR-Deptor binding (NSC126405) and induces cellular cytotoxicity in MM (Shi Y, et al 2016). In this study, we developed a new related chemical inhibitor (43 M) capable of inducing the inhibition of the mTOR / Deptor interaction and results in the negative regulation of Deptor that leads to the inhibition of proliferation and induces apoptosis in several MM cell lines. The cytotoxic effect of 43 M is not dependent of caspase activation and induces the activation of p70 and AKT (T308). This leads to the induction of apoptosis in MM cell lines and tumor cells derived from MM patients. The degradation of Deptor induced by 43 M is dependent on the proteasome complex since it was prevented in the presence of MG132. In vivo, 43 M prevents the expression of Deptor in a xenograft tumor, and delayed tumor growth and interestingly, induces the eradication of tumors in 40% of mice in a murine model of MM, without significant toxic implications. Recent studies show that Deptor expression protects MM cells against Bortezomib treatment, suggesting that anti-Deptor drugs can synergize with proteasome inhibitors (PIs). However, the combination of 43 M + Bortezomib was not synergistic, and was antagonistic in vitro. These results are probably due to the prevention of the proteasomal degradation of Deptor, suggesting a possible use of the 43 M inhibitor in MM in the absence of the current PIs. This study describes for the first time the possible role of Deptor as a therapeutic target using a chemical inhibitor capable of degrading and inducing a cytotoxic effect in MM cell lines. In addition, Deptor is reported as an important therapeutic target in an in vivo MM model.
