    "abstract_text": "Introduction: CA 15-3 is a glycoprotein expressed in several adenocarcinomas, especially of the breast. It is used to detect recurrent or metastatic disease. Elevated levels can also be found in adenocarcinomas of the ovary, lung, pancreas, and colon, and are also related to benign breast or ovarian disease, endometriosis, hepatitis, pregnancy and lactation. To our knowledge with the exception of multiple myeloma, there are no references for the significance of the CA 15-3 in hematological malignancies. Aim of our study was to evaluate the levels of CA 15-3 in patients with various hematological malignancies. Material and Methods: 84 patients with hematological malignancies were tested: MDS 27 pts, non Hodgkin lymphoma 12 pts, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma 3 pts, chronic lymphocytic leukemia 13 pts, acute leukemia: 7 pts, multiple myeloma 8 pts, chronic myeloid leukemia 3 pts and other chronic myeloproliferative disorders 11 pts. 55% of the patients were men with average age of 55 (17\u201387) and 45% were women with average age of 52 (35\u201364). A group of 45 healthy volunteers\u2019 blood donors was also tested. Immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) has been used to determine the circulating levels of the CA 15-3 marker. Results: None of the healthy volunteers had elevated Ca 15-3 levels. Among the 84 patients, 31 (36,9%) had elevated levels of CA 15-3. In MDS 10/27 pts, in Non Hodgkin Lymphoma 5/12 pts, in Hodgkin Lymphoma 1/3 pts, in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 5/13 pts, in Multiple Myeloma 4/8 pts, in acute leukemia 1/7 pts and in other myeloproliferative disorders 4/11 pts. The CA 15-3 levels in hematological patients were higher than the ones in the healthy group. The difference was statistically significant (p <0.0001), (Table 1). 31 patients who where either untreated or had recurrent disease (subgroup a), had elevated CA 15-3 levels (36,8 \u00b1 8,9 U/ml) while the rest 53 patients who were under therapy or were in remission (subgroup b) had normal levels (14,3 \u00b1 5,2 U/ml). A statistically significant difference between the two subgroups was observed, (p <0.0001), (Table 2). The low risk MDS patients (RA, RARS) had normal level of CA 15-3, while the high risk MDS patients (RAEB, RAEB-t, CMML) had high levels of CA 15-3. Conclusions: CA 15-3 can be an indicative marker of the activity of a hematological malignancy. Also, it might be of value in monitoring hematological diseases and response to therapy. Table 1  .
