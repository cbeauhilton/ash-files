    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION: Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive peripheral T-cell neoplasm caused by the Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 (HTLV-1). HTLV-1 infects up to 10 million people worldwide and is most endemic in Southwestern Japan, Western Africa, the Caribbean basin and South America. Cutaneous signs of ATLL are varied and may consist of macules (M), plaques (P), multiple papules (MP), tumoral nodules (TN), erythroderma (E) or mixed-lesions (\u22652 predominant lesions, ML). M and P forms are believed to carry a better prognosis. However, data on cutaneous presentation of ATLL remains scarce. Herein, we report cases of ATLL with cutaneous involvement diagnosed in 4 Latin American countries over the last 3 decades. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients (pts) diagnosed with ATLL between January 1995 and December 2019. ATLL subtypes were classified according to the Shimoyama criteria into acute, lymphomatous, chronic and smoldering. Primary cutaneous tumoral (PCT) variant was classified according to the 2019 International Revised ATLL Consensus. We designed 2 cohorts: the first, ATLL pts with cutaneous involvement, and the second, matched cases without cutaneous involvement. We determined the type of skin lesion as well as the survival associated with the various types of skin lesions. We compared the frequency of clinical features using Fisher's exact test. Treatment response was assessed according to Tsukasaki et al. (JCO 2009) criteria. To be classified as complete response (CR), partial response, and stable disease, these had to persist for a period of at least 4 weeks. We analyzed survival data according to ATLL subtype, cutaneous involvement status, and type of skin lesion using the Kaplan-Meier method and Log rank test. RESULTS: A total of 169 pts with ATLL were identified; 63 had cutaneous involvement and 106 did not. Clinical features are shown in Table 1. In both groups the median age was 57 years with a female predominance. Cutaneous involvement was most frequently found in acute (41%) and lymphomatous (37%) ATLL pts. The E (24%) and P (22 %) types were the most frequent skin lesions. Disease stage, presence of B symptoms, hypercalcemia, ECOG \u22652, elevated LDH, and IPI/ PIT score were not different among groups. Table 2 and Table 3 summarize the first-line therapy used and response rates. The use of first-line zidovudine plus interferon alpha (AZT-IFN), regardless of the type of skin lesion, resulted in relatively high response rates [overall response (OR) 100%, n=8; CR 62.5%] as compared to multi agent-chemotherapy (OR 33.3%, n=12). Overall, the presence of cutaneous involvement was associated with better overall survival (OS) compared to non-cutaneous involvement (aHR 0.55 [95% CI: 0.37-0.82], p<0.01; 1-year OS 53% vs. 27%, respectively, p=0.012) (Figure 1). PCT pts had better outcome compared to acute and lymphomatous ATLL forms (1-year OS 75% vs. 39% vs. 25%, respectively, p=0.002). The presence of P and MP skin lesions was associated with better OS compared to other subtypes (1-year OS: P/MP 65% vs. others 41%, respectively, p=0.027) (Figure 2, supplemental figure 1). In a multivariate analysis, hypercalcemia was an independent poor prognostic factor for survival among ATLL pts with cutaneous involvement (aHR 3.99 [95% CI: 139-11.45], p=0.01) (supplemental figure 2). One patient with lymphomatous ATLL and plaque lesions underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant with high-dose chemotherapy after achieving CR with AZT-IFN; patient remains alive and progression-free for 17 months. Illustrative cases of cutaneous ATLL are shown in Figure 3. CONCLUSION: In Latin American pts with aggressive ATLL, cutaneous involvement appears to be associated with better survival compared to non-cutaneous involvement. PCT subtype, an ATLL variant characterized by isolated skin lesions with no organ involvement and poor outcome, appeared to have a better prognosis compared to acute and lymphomatous ATLL forms. P and MP skin lesions were both associated with better survival. Hypercalcemia was found as an independent prognostic factor for survival in pts with cutaneous involvement. Finally, AZT-IFN appears to be reasonable first-line option for aggressive ATLL subtypes with cutaneous involvement regardless of the type of skin lesion at diagnosis, based on the relatively high response rates observed in this subset; further investigation in randomized clinical trials is needed.
