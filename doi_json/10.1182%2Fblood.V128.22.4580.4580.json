    "abstract_text": "Background Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is the major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It is characterized by an imbalance between the effector and regulatory arms of the immune system which results in the over production of inflammatory cytokines. Regulatory T (T regs) cells and T helper 17 (Th17) cells are two recently described lymphocyte subsets with opposing actions. Both can develop from na\u00efve CD4 + T cell precursors under the influence of TGF\u03b21. Th17 lymphocytes, are key effector cells in rodent models of human diseases including GVHD. The other subset, T regs, is essential for dominant immunologic tolerance. At our institution, patients transplanted using G-CSF primed bone marrow (G-BM), have a lower incidence of acute and chronic GVHD when compared to those transplanted with peripheral blood and not primed bone marrow. Some microenvironment characteristics of this hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) source remain unknown, as well as the difference between Tregs, Th17 and cytokine levels in patients who develop GVHD and those who do not. Objective To analyze the characteristics of thirty-eight G-BM donor samples, identifying lymphocytes subsets and associated cytokines, and comparing patients who developed chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and those who did not. Materials and Methods A prospective analysis was performed in 38 G-BM samples from donors from 1999 to 2016. Mononuclear cells were defrosted, counted, and viability was evaluated. A 24 hour resting with RPMI, and posterior activation with PMA (50 ng/ml) for 48 hours was performed. Cells were harvested and cytokines were evaluated by flow cytometry (CBA assay). From each sample, one million mononuclear cells were permeabilized, fixed, and stained with CD4-FITC, IL17A-PE, IFN -\u03b3 APC, and IL-4 PECy7, for their posterior phenotipication by flow cytometry. The samples were obtained in a BD LSR Fortessa cytometry, and analyzed with the Flow-Jo software. Patients (recipients) information was analyzed using SPSS v.21. Results GVHD incidence was reported as following: Three (8%) patients developed acute GVHD (2 grade II, and 1 grade IV), 11 patients (29%) developed chronic GVHD (9% extensive, and 91% limited), and 24 patients did not present either. Mononuclear cells from G-BM from donors of patients who developed cGVHD showed a pro inflammatory response, characterized by an increased concentration of IL-17A (15.5 vs 0.71 pg/mL, p=0.013), TNF-\u03b1 (80.27 vs 0.13 pg/mL, p=0.001), and IL-6 (4953.6 vs 11.75 pg/mL, p=0.025), after a mitogenic stimulation, compared to cells from donors of patients who did not developed GVHD. On the other hand, a decreased IL-10 production (2.62 vs 52.81 pg/mL, p=0.001) was documented in mononuclear cells from donors of patients who developed chronic GVHD, compared to donor cells of patients who did not. No significant difference in the production of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN -\u03b3 was observed. There was no difference in Th1 and Th2 between both groups, but mononuclear cells from donors of patients who developed chronic GVHD had a higher percentage of Th17 (1.02% vs 0.46%, p<0.001), and less Tregs (0.88% vs 1.95%, p<0.001), compared to those who did not developed GVHD. Conclusions Patients who develop cGVHD (29%) are characterized by a pro inflammatory response with an increased production of IL-17A, IL-6, and IFN -\u03b3, and also a major percentage of Th17 cells. Also, a decreased suppressive response was documented with reduced IL-10 and Tregs levels. The low incidence of cGVHD show that G-CSF primed bone marrow is an excellent source for allogeneic HSC transplantations, and would be useful to compare these results with other HSC sources.
