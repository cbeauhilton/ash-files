    "abstract_text": "Background: CD4 + T helper cells play critical roles in the regulation of pathogen-specific immune responses and immune tolerance. The formation of each individual T helper cell subset is dictated by the expression of a unique gene program. These gene programs are regulated by both the cytokine environment and cell-intrinsic, cytokine-responsive \"lineage-defining\" transcription factors, which imprint the conserved gene expression programs characteristic of a given T helper cell lineage. The transcriptional repressor Bcl-6 is one such factor, and has been identified as the lineage-defining transcription factor for the T follicular helper (T FH ) cell subset. T FH cells participate in the generation of humoral immunity by providing help to B cells, which are responsible for the production of pathogen-neutralizing antibodies. Interestingly, Bcl-6 expression has also been implicated in the formation of CD4 + central memory T (T CM ) cells, which play a critical role in long-term cell-mediated immunity. Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that Bcl-6 expression can be induced in effector T helper 1 (T H 1) cells in response to decreased interleukin 2 (IL-2) signaling. Consequently, T H 1 cells are capable of upregulating Bcl-6-dependent T FH - and T CM -like gene programs, suggesting that these cells may be able to contribute to aspects of long-term humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Despite these insights, the upstream factor(s) that directly control the expression of Bcl-6 remain largely unknown. Preliminary RNAseq analysis indicated that the expression of members of the Ikaros family of zinc-finger transcription factors, which have been shown to play important roles in regulating gene expression during hematopoiesis, correlated with that of Bcl-6 in T H 1 and T FH /T CM -like cells. As such, we hypothesized that Ikaros-family proteins may contribute to the regulation of Bcl-6 expression. Methods: Na\u00efve CD4 + T cells isolated from the spleens and lymph nodes of 5-8 week old C57BL/6 mice were stimulated with \u03b1-CD3 and \u03b1-CD28 in T H 1 polarizing conditions. Following the generation of T H 1 cells, these cells were split into either high IL-2 conditions to maintain the T H 1 phenotype or into low IL-2 conditions to induce the T FH /T CM -like phenotype. Total cellular RNA, total cellular protein, and chromatin samples were isolated for analysis. Results: In this study, we demonstrate that the Ikaros family members, Ikaros and Aiolos, are preferentially expressed in T FH /T CM -like cells when compared to T H 1 cells. siRNA knockdown demonstrates that the expression of Bcl-6 correlates with that of Ikaros and/or Aiolos. To define the molecular mechanisms that lead to the aforementioned findings, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to show that Ikaros and Aiolos directly bind to the Bcl-6 promoter region. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that Ikaros and Aiolos physically interact, suggesting that they may act cooperatively to promote Bcl-6 expression. Finally, Ikaros and Aiolos siRNA experiments show that reduced expression of these transcription factors correlates with a reduction in the expression of a number of canonical T FH and T CM genes. Conclusion: Collectively, these results demonstrate that the Ikaros family members Ikaros and Aiolos are IL-2-sensitive transcription factors that positively regulate Bcl-6 expression and that of key T FH and T CM genes. These data support the possibility that Ikaros and Aiolos may be critical factors in the induction of the T FH and T CM cell types and thus, potentially, in the regulation of long-term humoral and cell-mediated immunity.
