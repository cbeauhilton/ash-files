    "abstract_text": "Therapy resistance is still a major obstacle to successful treatment in a significant number of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients. It has been previously demonstrated that children with ALL whose leukemia cells exhibit in vitro resistance to single or a combination of drugs have a significantly worse prognosis compared to patients with sensitive leukemic cells ( Ramakers-van Woerden N, et al Leukemia  18 (3): 521 \u20139 2004 ). Ion channels are becoming one of the potential targets for cancer therapy and putative biochemical modulators of conventional chemotherapy ( Conti M, J Exp Ther Oncol . 4 (2): 161 \u20136, 2004 ). In particular, K + channels belonging to the hERG1 family are attracting most attention, since they are over-expressed in a broad range of primary acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) as well as in both myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cell lines ( Pillozzi S, et al Leukemia  16 : 1791 \u20131798, 2002 ; Smith GA, et al, JBC  227 : 18528 \u201318534, 2002 ). hERG1 channel expression confers a greater capacity to engraft the bone marrow and invade the bloodstream in NOD/SCID mice injected with AML cells. This fact corresponds to a greater malignancy (shorter overall survival and higher probability to relapse) in hERG1 positive AML patients ( Pillozzi S, et al Blood  110 : 1238 \u20131250, 2007 ). It was also recently shown that the expression of hERG1 is related to the chemosensitivity of cancer cells to vincristine, paclitaxel, and hydroxy-camptothecin ( Chen SZ, et al Cancer Chemother Pharmacol  56 (2): 212 \u201320, 2005 ). We studied the expression and role of hERG1 channels in various B lymphoid leukaemia cell lines and primary childhood B lymphoid leukaemia samples. It emerged that: hERG1 K + channels are expressed in both all the leukaemia cell lines and primary childhood B leukaemia samples; the N-terminus deleted, herg1b isoform was preferentially expressed in both cell lines and primary samples; in childhood leukaemia patients, the level of herg1b expression correlated with response to therapy. B lymphoid leukaemia cell lines were co-cultured on human bone marrow stromal cells, a system known to enhance leukaemia cell survival and escape from drug-induced apoptosis. In these cultures, the addition of a specific hERG1 inhibitor, E4031, induced a significant apoptosis in leukaemia cells, bypassing the protective effect of the bone marrow microenvironment. We hypothesise that hERG1 channels can represent a novel molecular device regulating drug sensitivity in childhood acute leukaemia cells, and that targeting of hERG1 channels can restore a proper pro-apoptotic response to chemotherapy in resistant B lymphoid leukemic cells.",
