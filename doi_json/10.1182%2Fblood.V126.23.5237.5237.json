    "abstract_text": "Intro:Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematology neoplasms ranging from indolent to very aggressive conditions. The reported incidence is of 5/100,000/year in the whole population changing up to 50/100,000/year after the age of 60 and up to 165 after 65. Due to the heterogeneity of MDS, patients are stratified into subgroups according to prognostic score systems (IPSS) to identify the best risk-adapted treatment strategy. These therapeutic strategies are not univocally agreed, creating differences among groups. Moreover data on economic aspects are partial and sometimes controversial, owing to different healthcare resources considered (transfusions, medications, procedures, hospitalization, treatment of comorbidities, first of all infectious complications). The adoption of Regional Hemato-Oncology Registries of Diagnostic Service Registries can allow for better quality in diagnostic procedures and treatment as well as improving the evaluation of healthcare costs in these patients. Methods: In the Italian Lazio Region the Rome and Lazio Group of Myelodysplasias (GROM-L) is presently active as a registry of MDS in adults, exploiting the collaboration of all Hematology Centers in the Region: diagnostic procedures and therapeutic protocols of patients included into this registry are harmonized. In the present study we report the results of the evaluation of costs of the healthcare resources supplied to 659 patients with MDS in the Lazio Region during the period 2002-2009, adopting the \u200e third party payer viewpoint (.e. the Healthy Service of the Lazio Region -SSR Lazio). In Table 1 is reported the distribution of the MDS diagnostic categories in our cohort of patients. The following healthcare resources are included: Red Blood Cell (RBC) and Platelet (Plt) transfusions, Erythropoietic Stimulating Agents, antineoplastic and immunomodulatory drugs, hospitalization and treatment of infectious (bacterial, viral and fungal) complications (Table 2). Healthcare resources are valued according to published \u200esources. Costs are expressed in Euros (\u20ac) 2013. Costs occurred after 2002 are discounted at 3% real social rate. Results:The overall cost for the 659 patients of the GROM-L Registry is \u20ac22.05 millions (US$24.21 millions), with an average cost per patient of \u20ac33.455,65 (US$ 36.727) (Table 3). The estimated annual cost for the SSR Lazio for the management of all the resident patients with adult MDS (around 183 per year) reaches \u20ac1.23millions (US$ 1.35millions). Data on costs related with MDS diagnostic subgroups are available too. In particular our data confirm that the transfusion dependency do represent one of the more valid predictor index of the healthcare costs in patients with MDS (Frytak et al., 2009, Drummond et al. 2005, Goldberg et al. 2012). The reduction of transfusion dependency in these patients do represent a new challenge for improving not simply the healthcare costs but the Health-Related Quality of Life- HRQoL) in these patients (Drummond et al. 2005; Brazier et al. 2007, Szende et al. 2009).
