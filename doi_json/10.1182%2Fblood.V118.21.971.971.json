    "abstract_text": "Abstract 971 Unlike the case in acute myeloid leukemia, there is limited information on the prognostic impact of IDH mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In the current study of 277 patients with MDS, IDH mutations were detected in 34 (12%) cases: 26 IDH2 (all R140Q) and 8 IDH1 (six R132S and two R132C). Mutational frequency was 4% (2 of 56) in refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), 12% (16 of 130) in refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, 14% (2 of 14) in MDS-unclassifiable, 14% (6 of 42) in refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB)-1, and 23% (8 of 35) in RAEB-2. Normal karyotype was noted in all but one IDH1 -mutated cases and 13 IDH2 -mutated cases. Multivariable analysis identified presence of mutant IDH1 (p=0.0004; HR 4.0, 95% CI 1.9\u20138.8), revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) risk category (p<0.0001), and red cell transfusion need (p=0.002) as independent predictors of inferior survival (Figure 1). In a similar multivariable analysis, mutant IDH1 was the only variable associated with shortened leukemia-free survival (p=0.001; HR 7.0, 95% CI 2.3\u201320.8). The presence of IDH2 R140Q did not affect overall (p=0.54) or leukemia-free (p=0.81) survival (Figure 2). The current study suggests a powerful adverse prognostic effect for mutant IDH1 in MDS.
