    "abstract_text": "Objective To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of decitabine (DAC) in combination with HAAG regimen [homoharringtonine (HHT), cytarabine (Ara-C), doxorubicin (Acla) and recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)] for advanced patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods Thirty-six patients with advanced AML receiving DAC combined with HAAG chemotherapy in our center from December 2012 to August 2015 were enrolled in this study. Eighteen of them were refractory or relapsed AML, and another 18 patients were those who didn't achieve complete remission (CR) after a course of induction chemotherapy. The therapeutic responses, side effects and long-time survival were retrospectively analyzed. Results After a course of treatment, the rate of CR and partial response (PR) was 58.3% (21/36) and 22.2% (8/36) respectively, while the overall response rate (ORR) was 80.6% (29/36) in the cohort. For the patients with refractory or relapse AML, CR was 61.0% (11/18), PR was 22.2% (4/18), and ORR was 83.3% (15/18). While for the other not getting CR after a course of induction chemotherapy, CR was 55.6% (10/18), PR was 22.2% (4/18), and ORR was 77.8% (14/18). Grade 4 hematological toxicities were observed in all patients, and 72.2% cases experienced infection. And all non hematological side effects were mild and well-tolerated. With a median follow-up of 7.5 (0.5~33.3) months, the 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 43.3%, 24.2% for the refractory or relapsed AML patients, and 61.6% for those not achieving CR after a course of induction chemotherapy. The difference was significantly ( P =0.01). Conclusion DAC combined with HAAG regimen is safe and effective salvage treatment for advanced stage AML patients.
