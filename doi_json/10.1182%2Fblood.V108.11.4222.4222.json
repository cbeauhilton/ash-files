    "abstract_text": "PBI-1402 is a non-toxic, well-defined low molecular weight synthetic hematopoietic growth stimulant. PBI-1402 promotes the proliferation and maturation of hematopoietic progenitors (myeloid and erythroid populations) yielding a biological efficacy comparable to G-CSF, GM-CSF and EPO in in vitro human bone marrow cell proliferation and colony formation assays. An additive effect is observed when PBI-1402 is combined with G-CSF, GM-CSF and EPO. In human bone marrow colony assay, PBI-1402 enhances the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells: CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM with a predominant effect on BFU-E. Furthermore, PBI-1402 exerts its activity via a different mechanism of action than EPO and stem cell factor (SCF) and at an earlier stage on more immature hematopoietic progenitors. PBI-1402 is targeted as an adjunct to cancer chemo/radiotherapy, bone marrow transplantation and diseases involving neutropenia and anemia."
