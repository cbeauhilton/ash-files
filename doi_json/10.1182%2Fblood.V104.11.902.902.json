    "abstract_text": "Background : The beneficial effect of adding rituximab to CHOP has been shown for elderly patients with DLBCL (Coiffier et al , N.E.J.M 2002). We have shown that HDT with autologous stem cell transplantation is superior to CHOP in young adults with DLCL ( Milpied et al GOELAMS 072 trial, N.E.J.M 2004). The feasibility of adding rituximab to front-line HDT remains to be established. Methods : A prospective pilot trial was proposed to patients with DLBCL, with intermediate-high or high adjusted IPI, up to the age of 60 y.o. This program consisted of 2 courses of high-dose CHOP-like regimen, 15 days apart, with rituximab (375/mg/m 2 ) on day 1 of each course, followed by rituximab on d 22, harvest of G-CSF mobilised peripheral blood stem cells on d 28,29, then rituximab on d 36 followed by a course of high-dose methotrexate with cytarabin. For patients who achieved at least a PR after these 3 courses, a BEAM regimen started on d 66 to 80 followed by the infusion of stem cells. Results : Between 04/2002 and 05/2003, 42 pts gave their informed consent and were included in that trial. Median age was 50 y.o (18\u201360 y.o), 23 had WHO PS \u2265 2, the LDH level was >N in 41 pts and 38 had stage III or IV disease. The age-adjusted IPI was intermediate-high in 23 and high in 19 pts. The program was completed in 30 pts (71%), 3 pts died of toxicity before the BEAM regimen, 8 pts failed to achieve at least a PR after the first 3 courses and 1 refused the autologous transplant. On an intent-to-treat basis, the response rate at the end of the treatment was CR/Cru=64%, PR=7%, less than PR or progression= 22% and toxic death=7%. No toxic death was directly attributable to the addition of rituximab. With a median FU of 19 m, the KM 2y probability of OS and EFS are 79% and 59% respectively, these figures compare to those achieved without rituximab in the previous trial as shown on the table: Conclusion : The addition of 4 doses of rituximab to this HDT program is feasible with no unexpected toxicity, allows the harvesting of sufficient numbers of stem cells to support an autologous transplant with a BEAM regimen in responding patients. This treatment is now being randomly prospectively compared with CHOP-14-rituximab in youg adults with DLBCL (Goelams 075 trial).Supported in part by Roche which kindly provided rituximab for that trial and by DRC Nantes programme N\u00b0:02/2N 2002.  .
