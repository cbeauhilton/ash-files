We herein present evidence that the hypercoagulable state in \u03b2-Thalassemia disease patients is to a significant extent the result of prior splenectomy. Patients and Methods: One hundred and ten clinically stable hemoglobin E/\u03b2-Thalassemia outpatients, on no medication aside from folic acid and who received no blood transfusion in the preceding 4 weeks were studied. All gave written informed consent, and study protocol was approved by the institution ethics committee on studies in humans (#0774/2548). Echocardiogram was used to estimate systolic PA pressure (SPAP). Clinical features and laboratory data were stratified according to the presence or absence of the spleen, and statistical analysis was done by STATA version 10 (Stata Corp, Texas), considering a P value <0.05 as statistically significant. Results: Of the 110 patients, 61 were asplenic and females comprised 51% in both groups. Selected statistically significant results are shown in the table .  Results . Asplenic (61 Patients) .

Splenectomy should be more judiciously applied than heretofore, and if performed, measures to blunt or prevent a subsequent hypercoagulable and inflammatory state, which could lead to PAH should be initiated.
