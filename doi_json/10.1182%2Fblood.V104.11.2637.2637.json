    "abstract_text": "SGN-30 is a chimeric mAb which recognizes the CD30 antigen found on tumor cells from patients (pts) with Hodgkin\u2019s disease (HD) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). In preclinical experiments, SGN-30 was shown to have antitumor activity in both in vitro and in vivo models of HD and ALCL. The results of a multi-dose phase I study showed minimal toxicity associated with doses of 2\u201312 mg/kg as six weekly IV infusions. One complete response (CR) was seen in the three non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma patients (2 ALCL, 1 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) accrued to the study and two patients demonstrated stable disease (SD) over time. A phase II multi-dose study was initiated to further evaluate the safety, antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics of six weekly IV infusions of 6 mg/kg of SGN-30 in pts with relapsed or refractory HD or systemic ALCL (sALCL). Five patients (2M, 3F) with ALCL have been enrolled, with a median age of 52 (range 33\u201375) and 3 median prior therapies (range 2\u20135). Multiple doses of SGN-30 have been well tolerated in all of the pts. Drug-related adverse events have been typically mild and consistent with mAb administration. No drug-related grade 3/4 events have been observed. Two patients have had objective responses with one patient achieving a CR. The patient\u2019s baseline CT scan showed a 5.1 x 2.0 cm chest wall mass in the lower left anterior lateral chest wall representing local lymphoma recurrence. After six doses of SGN-30 the mass disappeared completely with some edema in the chest wall but no obvious residual mass. The duration of response is pending at this time, and it will be presented in the meeting. Another patient experienced a partial response. The patient, who entered the study with constitutional symptoms and extensive cutaneous and nodal disease, had resolution of all skin lesions, significant reduction in adenopathy and improvement in constitutional symptoms after completion of her SGN-30 therapy. The patient progressed after discontinuation of therapy. Of the other three patients, one had SD and two progressed. These early results are promising and accrual to the trial continues.",
