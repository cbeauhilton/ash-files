    "abstract_text": "The bone marrow (BM) has an important function as primary lymphoid organ through the process of hematopoiesis. This process is sustained by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their life-long production of new blood cells, which is made possible by their unique ability to self-renew. Next to this, BM also functions as a secondary lymphoid organ, as it can mediate primary T cell responses against invading pathogens. We and others have shown that activated T cells can influence the hematopoietic process through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This indicates that adaptive immune responses and hematopoiesis are intertwined in the BM, though most of the cellular and molecular interactions that occur during this crosstalk are yet unknown. Based on previous observations that T cell deficient mice have altered hematopoiesis and that depletion of T cells from allogeneic BM grafts compromises HSC engraftment, we questioned to what extent BM T cells can directly affect the function of HSCs. To test this, we sorted and co-cultured murine BM T cells with HSCs (Lin - Sca-1 + c-Kit + CD48 - CD150 + ). We found that particularly BM CD8 + central memory (CD44 + CD62L + ) T cells (T cm ) enhance the capacity of HSCs to self-renew. Furthermore, we found that TCR-transgenic mice, which do not have memory T cells, have lower numbers of HSCs, which could subsequently be increased by transferring BM CD8 + T cm . Remarkably, an increase in HSC numbers was also observed when HSCs were cultured with only supernatant derived from BM CD8 + T cm . Moreover, HSCs cultured with supernatant from BM CD8 + T cm and later transplanted in myeloablated hosts displayed a strongly enhanced ability to restore hematopoiesis. Importantly, the strong impact of BM T cells on HSCs was not only apparent in the steady state situation, but also following a viral infection with either acute or chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). We could establish that both acute and chronic LCMV-specific CD8 + T cells or supernatant from these cells could increase the HSC self-renewal capacity . In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that BM memory CD8 + T cells can positively influence the function of HSC through soluble mediators. We postulate that this process is particularly relevant after immune activation, in order to protect and/or restore the HSC pool and the subsequent hematopoietic recovery. We are currently using a proteomics approach to identify these soluble mediator produced by CD8 + T cells. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
