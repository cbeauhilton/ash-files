This included estimation of typical population pharmacokinetic parameters and inter-individual and residual variability and identification of covariates that are significant predictors of variability in a pooled population of children and adults. Patients and Methods Plasma FVIII activity PK data were collected for 3 ADVATE\u00ae clinical trials in previously treated patients: 184 full PK data sets for 100 adults/adolescents, aged 10 to 65 years, and from 52 reduced sample PK data sets for 52 children, aged 1 to 6 years. Population PK analysis was conducted using non-linear mixed effects modeling with the first-order integral approximation method in SAS\u00ae software (NLMIXED procedure). A two-compartment model was used as the base model and the influence of age and weight were explored. Results Two-compartment PK models with additive plus proportional residual variability model and exponential inter-individual variability model adequately described the data. Clearance (CL) is significantly correlated with age and body weight and central volume of distribution (V1) is also related with body weight. The estimated population PK parameters were (mean parameter, (inter-individual variability %)): CL (2.92 mL/kg\u00b7h, 22%), V1 (0.46 dL/kg, 5.2%), peripheral volume V2 (0.09 dL/kg) and inter-compartmental clearance Q (2.07 mL/ kg\u00b7h). Conclusions A population PK model that describes the combined PK data from adults and pediatric studies has been constructed. A significant portion of inter-individual variability in both volume and clearance can be explained by subject weight. An additional smaller effect of age on clearance but not volume was observed. A population PK model for Factor VIII could provide the clinician with advantages in designing a patient specific treatment regimen. It could provide more relevant guidance in individual patient pharmacokinetics than just incremental recovery without the burden of a full PK assessment of the patient.
