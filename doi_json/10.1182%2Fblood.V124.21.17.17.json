    "abstract_text": "The evolution of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been previously described either in studies of large patient cohorts with focus on only a restricted number of AML-associated genes or in smaller series of relapsed patients studied by genome-wide techniques. We set out to comprehensively characterize the genetic evolution in a large AML cohort in order to understand molecular mechanisms of relapse and therapy-resistance. We performed exome-sequencing of matched bone marrow or peripheral blood samples taken at diagnosis, complete remission and relapse from 47 patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). Samples were collected within the German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) at the partner sites in Berlin and Munich. The median age at diagnosis was 65y (range: 21-89y). FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) and NPM1 mutation status at diagnosis was available for all but one patient ( FLT3 -ITD - / NPM1 - , n=5; FLT3 -ITD + / NPM1 - , n=9; FLT3 -ITD - / NPM1 + , n=16; FLT3 -ITD + / NPM1 + , n=16). On average, 96% of the target sequence was covered at least 10-fold (minimum coverage defined for variant calling). The following criteria were applied for identification of somatic mutations: Variant allele frequency (VAF) \u00b320% either at diagnosis or at relapse and VAF<5% at remission. We filtered for mutations with translational consequences, excluded known error-prone genes and dismissed common germline polymorphisms (dbSNP 138; MAF\u00b31%). Thereby, we identified a total of 777 genes to be somatically mutated, of which 104 were recurrently affected. Mutation frequencies of 18 genes found mutated both in our cohort and in 86 CN-AML patients reported by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, NEJM 2013) are shown in Figure 1 A. Seven genes were recurrently altered only at diagnosis (e.g. CBL ) and 16 genes were recurrently altered only at relapse in our cohort (e.g. KDM6A, SF3B1 and SRSF2 ). At diagnosis, the number of somatic mutations per patient varied between 5 and 34 (median: 17). At relapse, the number of mutations ranged from 2 to 57 (median: 17). Mutations in several AML-associated genes (e.g. DNMT3A, RUNX1, IDH1 and IDH2 ) showed similar VAFs at diagnosis and relapse in the vast majority of cases. In contrast, WT1 mutations were gained at relapse in 4/6 (67%) patients and FLT3 point mutations were below 5% VAF at relapse in 7/12 (58%) patients initially positive for these variants. In total, 92 mutations present at diagnosis were lost at relapse (VAF <5%) while 116 mutations were acquired during disease progression. Based on cytogenetics and copy number alteration (CNA) analysis of exome data, we detected partial or complete gain/loss of chromosomes. Five patients (11%) acquired chromosomal alterations during disease progression. Trisomy 8 was the only recurrent chromosomal abnormality gained in 3 patients (6%) at relapse. To detect pre-leukemic lesions, we evaluated our exome data for the persistence of mutations in 40 AML-associated driver genes during remission. We limited our analysis to mutations previously reported as confirmed somatic (COSMIC annotation) to avoid confounding with private germline variants. Strikingly, 25/47 (53%) of patients carried non-silent mutations in these genes with VAF>5% (median: 31%, range: 9-75%) at remission (30 mutations in total). In contrast, other mutations (e.g. in FLT3 or NRAS ) found in these patients could not be detected at remission, consistent with therapy response. Based on VAF, 23/30 (77%) persistent mutations showed a dynamic pattern over the course of disease with a relative change of >20%, likely due to partial eradication/expansion of leukemic or pre-leukemic clones. Persistent mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, RUNX1 and IDH2 were observed in 28%, 11%, 6% and 4% of patients in our cohort, respectively ( Figure 1 B). Among patients with DNMT3A mutation at diagnosis, those with persistent mutations tended to relapse earlier (n=13; median time to relapse 270 days; range: 81-586) than patients without detectable DNMT3A mutations at remission (n=7; median time to relapse 508 days; range: 235-1697; p=0.111). Our findings provide insights into the genetic evolution during the course of disease in a large cohort of relapsed CN-AML. Information about the dynamics of genetic lesions (e.g. persistent or relapse-specific mutations) may have prognostic significance and allow for tailored approaches to treat or to prevent relapse of AML.
