    "abstract_text": "Background: MicroRNAs are small RNA species that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and are aberrantly expressed in many cancers including hematological malignancies. Some reports suggested that aberrations in the miR-22-TET2 regulatory network are common in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemia, and its aberrant expression correlates with poor survival. We attempted to identify the clinical role of miR-22 and TET-2 in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Materials and Methods: A total of 41 MDS patients who treated with hypomethylating agents were recruited. Real time RT-PCR was performed to assess the expression levels of miR-22 and TET-2 mutation in bone marrow samples at the time of diagnosis. And we investigated the relationship between its results and clinical outcomes. Results: TET2 mutation frequency in the higher risk group based the IPSS and IPSS-R was lower than that of lower risk group (11.1% vs 38.1%). miR22 expression was also down-regulated in higher risk group (higher risk: 1.70 \u00b1 0.96 vs lower risk: 3.14 \u00b1 1.38, p=0.006). TET2 mutation seemed to be different according to the responsiveness to hypomethylating agents. TET2 mutation, IPSS, and IPSS-R were significantly associated with the risk of leukemic transformation. Patients with an decreased value in the consecutive assessment of miR-22 at the time of diagnosis and 3 months after initial treatment tended to be associated with poor survival outcome (survival rate at 3 years: 18.2% vs 35.1% for patients with an increase, p=0.168). Prognostic factors for survival included TET-2 mutation, cytogenetics, IPSS or IPSS-R, and leukemic transformation. Conclusion: miR-22 expression and TET2 mutation had a clinical impact on outcomes in MDS patients treated with hypomethylating agents. And these biomarkers might have a potential as a prognostic factor for MDS patients.
