    "abstract_text": "Background : Fibrin, the end product of the coagulation cascade, consolidates the platelet plug at site of thrombosis: polymerized fibrin supports platelet adhesion under low and high shear rate conditions (Hantgan RR et al., Thromb Haemost 1992) and triggers platelet procoagulant activity (Beguin S et al., Blood 1999). These responses are largely independent of the integrin \u03b1II\u03b23 and are carried by a yet ill-defined receptor. Platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI) has a well-established key role in the initiation of thrombosis since it supports collagen-mediated platelet activation but it has recently been recognized to interact with other macromolecules such as fibronectin, vitronectin and laminins. We hypothesized GPVI could be the \u201cmissing\u201d platelet receptor of fibrin. Aim of the study : to challenge the hypothesis that glycoprotein VI (GPVI) could be a functional fibrin receptor Methods : Thrombin generation was measured using calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT) in PRP from healthy volunteers, four GPVI-deficient patients and one patient with a fibrinogen deficiency. CAT was also performed on washed platelets mixed with prothrombin complex (FII, FVII, FIX, FX), antithrombin and fibrinogen. GPVI was blocked using the Fab of the monoclonal antibody 9O12. Fibrin polymerization was blocked using the GPRP peptide. GPVI binding to fibrin was measured in vitro using recombinant soluble GPVI (GPVI-Fc). Flow based adhesion assays were performed in capillary chambers coated with polymerized fibrin at variable shear rates and platelet morphological changes analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The formation of fibrin-platelet thrombi was visualized by perfusing recalcified blood containing A647 fibrinogen in flow chambers (Vena8 Fluoro+ Cellix) coated with collagen and tissue factor. In a second step, the perfusion of hirudinated blood in which platelets were stained by A488-RAM1 allowed to visualize platelet recruitment by fibrin rich clots. Results : Thrombin generation triggered by tissue factor was impaired in the PRP of patients with a GPVI deficiency or in the presence of the Fab 9O12 as indicated by a respective decrease in the peak height of 45 and 25% as compared to controls. This effect was observed regardless the trigger of thrombin generation and required platelet activation. Measuring thrombin generation in a purified system showed that fibrinogen dose-dependently increased the thrombin peak by up to 150% at 3 mg/mL but the Fab 9O12 blunted this effect. Moreover, the Fab 9O12 had no effect on thrombin generation in the PRP of a fibrinogen-deficient patient confirming a GPVI/fibrin(ogen)interplay. Blocking fibrin polymerization by GPRP reduced the thrombin peak in normal PRP, in fibrinogen-supplemented PRP of the fibrinogen-deficient patient and in purified conditions. In contrast GPRP had no effect on the thrombin peak in normal PRP containing the Fab 9O12 and in the PRP of GPVI-deficient patients. The proof that GPVI specifically interacts with fibrin was obtained in a binding assay showing a dose-dependent binding of GPVI-Fc to fibrin polymers that was reversed by the Fab 9O12. Platelets adhered to polymerized fibrin resulting in platelet shape change and exposure of phosphatidylserine. Platelet adhesion on a fibrin network was observed at low (300 s -1 ) and high (1500 s -1 ) shear rates with the formation of small contractile thrombi. Adhesion was decreased by 62% for 9O12-treated platelets and by 43% with the blood of GPVI-deficient mice as compared to controls. Importantly, lack of GPVI or its blockade decreased stationary adhesion indicating that GPVI is required to stabilize the interactions between platelets and fibrin. Finally when hirudinated blood was perfused at a shear rate of 1500 s -1 onto preformed fibrin-rich clots, the Fab 9O12 decreased the recruitment of platelets by up to 93%. Conclusions : Here we show for the first time that GPVI acts as a receptor for polymerized fibrin with two major functions: GPVI interaction with polymerized fibrin triggers (i) a new loop amplifying thrombin generation and (ii) platelet recruitment at the clot surface. These, so far, unrecognized properties of GPVI confer it a key role in the maturation of the thrombus by facilitating its growth and stabilization in addition to its well-known effect in the initiation of thrombus formation.
