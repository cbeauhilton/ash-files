Individual variability in pharmacokinetics (PK) has resulted in dosing ranges, rather than fixed doses. N8-GP (ESPEROCT \u00ae ) is an extended half-life recombinant FVIII product. The pathfinder trials evaluated routine prophylaxis and bleed treatment in previously treated adolescents/adults (pathfinder 2) and children (pathfinder 5) with severe hemophilia A and perioperative management of major surgery (pathfinder 3). Methods: Adolescents/adults (aged \u226512 y) were administered 50 IU/kg N8-GP every 4 days (Q4D) as routine prophylaxis in the main phase; alternative weekly dosing was explored in 2 extension phases. For the on-demand treatment arm, patients were to be given 20 to 70 IU/kg, depending on bleed severity and desired FVIII levels. Children (aged <12 y) on prophylaxis were administered a target of 60 (50-75) IU/kg N8-GP twice weekly. For surgery, a pre-trial test dose of 50 IU/kg was administered with PK assessment and then dosing in the study was to achieve desired FVIII suggested by World Federation of Hemophilia guidelines. Results: Pathfinder 2 enrolled 186 patients (46 from the US) with 128 (69%) completing the second extension phase encompassing 785 patient-years (66,577 exposure days) with 2,758 treated bleeds. On-demand patients (n=12) treated for a total of 37 patient-years of exposure reported 1,270 (46%) bleeds. In the main phase, 105 of 175 adolescents/adults on prophylaxis (50 IU/kg Q4D) experienced 436 bleeds with a median annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of 1.2. Through the study (mean 3.5 years), 177 adolescents/adults on doses of ~52 IU/kg Q4D had a median ABR of 0.99 and mean (95% CI) FVIII trough levels of 3.1 (2.6-3.4) IU/dL. Treatment of bleeding through extension 1 is described in Table; the median dose for mild/moderate bleeds was 42 IU/kg. For participants who were in the on-demand arm, the median initial dose was 28 IU/kg, with 88.4% of bleeds treated with a single dose. In subjects receiving prophylaxis, the median initial dose matched the prophylaxis dose (52 IU/kg), and 76% of bleeds received a single dose. For 15 severe bleeds, the median total dose was 111 IU/kg per episode. Pathfinder 5 enrolled 68 children (34 aged 0-5 y, 34 aged 6-11 y), 95% previously on prophylaxis; 62 completed the extension, amounting to 306 patient-years (32,138 exposure days) with mean exposure of 4.5 years. Overall, 55 patients (81%) reported 330 bleeds; most were traumatic (67%). Median ABR in the main phase (0.48 years) was 2.0 and through the entire study was 0.8 with mean (95% CI) FVIII trough activity of 1.9 (1.6-2.5) IU/dL. The mean prophylaxis dose was 64.7 IU/kg at a mean interval of 3.5 days, likely reflecting rounding the targeted 60 IU/kg twice weekly dose. For 70 bleeds in the main phase, 88% of bleeds were treated with 1 to 2 injections; median utilization for bleeds was 68 IU/kg ( Table ). Pathfinder 3 evaluated 45 surgeries in 33 adolescents/adults; 96% were reported as excellent/good efficacy. Median preoperative dose mirrored test dose (52 IU/kg) with median total dose per surgery of 702 IU/kg (until 14 days post-surgery). Postoperative dosing was at ~24-hour intervals with the number of doses and treatment duration dependent on procedure ( Table ). Conclusion: The pathfinder trials demonstrate effective prophylaxis was achieved with very consistent prophylaxis dosing for both adolescents/adults (~50 IU/kg Q4D) and children (~65 IU/kg twice weekly). Bleeds were generally treated for patients on prophylaxis with a single prophylactic dose (~50 or ~65 IU/kg). Dosing intervals in severe bleeding and surgery were ~24 hours, including in children.
