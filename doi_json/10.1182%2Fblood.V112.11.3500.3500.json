    "abstract_text": "KRN7000 is a potent synthetic derivative of alpha-galactosylceramide and ligand for CD1d molecules expressed on antigen-presenting cells. Subsequent presentation of KRN7000 by CD1d to invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, a subset of natural killer T cells expressing invariant T cell receptor alpha, results in the rapid release of Th1, Th2, or immune regulatory cytokines and initiation of multiple downstream cellular events such as T cell polarization and expansion of dendritic cell subsets. Previously we have demonstrated that liposomal formulation of KRN7000 containing a model antigen induces antigen specific immune tolerance by way of regulatory dendritic cells and induction of Foxp3 + regulatory T (Treg) cells. In this study, we examined the ability of KRN7000 embedded in a liposomal bilayer (RGI-2001) to prevent acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), as Tregs have been shown to have a pivotal role in regulating immune responses to alloantigens. RGI-2001 demonstrated potent activity in reducing GvHD lethality in mice that received fully mismatched bone marrow cells (BMC) and whole spleen cells (WSC). A single intravenous administration of RGI-2001 given on day 0 reproducibly demonstrated efficacy in prolonging the survival of mice relative to untreated mice in a total of 16 independent experiments using lethally-irradiated (9 Gys) Balb/c (H-2d) recipients transplanted with 5\u00d710e6 C57BL/6 (H-2b) T cell depleted BMC with 5\u00d710e6 or 2.5\u00d710e6 WSC. Statistically significant prolongation by Log-rank test was observed at the doses > 1 ng/kg in mice that received 2.5\u00d710e6 WSC, and at the doses > 10 ng/kg in those that received 5\u00d710e6 WSC. Investigation of mice that survived greater than 100 days demonstrated multi-lineage hematopoietic reconstitution by donor derived cells. Next, we investigated the kinetics of Treg expansion following BMT using the model receiving 2.5\u00d710e6 WSC. The results revealed significantly accelerated expansion of donor-derived Tregs in RGI-2001 treated animals as compared with untreated animals. In a representative experiment, 3\u20134 fold higher percentages of Foxp3 + cells were found in H-2b + CD4 + cells in RGI-2001 treated animals on day 15 post BMT as follows: untreated (n=5) vs RGI-2001 (n=5), 4.5\u00b10.7 % vs 20.7\u00b16.0% (spleen), 2.4\u00b11.3% vs 10.6\u00b15.0% (mesenteric lymph nodes) and 5.4\u00b12.8% vs 15.7\u00b16.0% (peripheral lymph nodes). Furthermore, allo-responses of RGI-2001 treated spleen cells were suppressed in an antigen-specific manner. Proliferation of RGI-2001 treated spleen cells was significantly reduced when stimulated with host (Balb/c) antigen presenting cells (APCs) in vitro while responsiveness to a third party (C3H) APCs remained. Based on these findings, we investigated if the second injection of RGI-2001 on day 15 could further support the expansion/maintenance of Tregs post BMT. Results demonstrated further improvement in the survival as well as clinical score of mice that received RGI-2001 treatment on both day 0 and day 15 as compared to those received the treatment only on day 0. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that RGI-2001 promotes the expansion of donor-derived Tregs which specifically suppress T-cell responses against host alloantigens, thereby reducing the GvHD lethality.",
