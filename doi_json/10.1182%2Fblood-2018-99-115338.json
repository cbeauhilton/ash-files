    "abstract_text": "Mutations in GATA1 are seen in rare cases of dyserythropoietic anemia and in a subset of patients with Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA). Of note the truncation mutations in DBA, known as GATA1s, closely resemble those that are more commonly associated with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in children with Down syndrome (DS). Studies with a mouse model of the Gata1s mutation revealed that replacement of the full-length protein by the shortened isoform led to a marked yet transient enhancement in megakaryopoiesis, similar in some respects to transient myeloproliferative disorder in DS. Furthermore, these mutant mice displayed impaired embryonic erythropoiesis but ostensibly no defects in adult hematopoiesis. In our efforts to better understand the connection between GATA1s and DBA, we comprehensively studied erythropoiesis in the Gata1s mouse strain. We observed a striking impairment in erythropoiesis in fetuses at E10.5 though E12.5, but saw improvement as the animals progressed through E14.5 and beyond. Defects included impaired terminal maturation and reduced numbers of erythroid progenitors, likely at the expense of expanded megakaryopoiesis. RNA-sequencing revealed that both erythroid genes and megakaryocytic genes were altered by the Gata1s mutation. Epiproteomic histone modification analysis further revealed there was an accumulation of H3K27 methylation in the R3 (CD71 hi Ter119 hi ) erythroid progenitor population, which suggests that GATA1 has a link to the epigenetic machinery that is altered in Gata1s mutant cells. Despite a global increase in H3K27me3, critical Gata2 regulatory elements in Gata1s mutant erythroid progenitors were marked by substantially less H3K27me3 than in wild-type littermates. Given that overexpression of GATA2 has been reported to impair erythropoiesis, we investigated whether reducing the GATA2 levels would ameliorate the phenotype. Indeed, we observed that haploinsufficiency for Gata2 rescued the erythroid defects of Gata1s fetuses. Next, to comprehensively study the effect of absence of the GATA1 N-terminus genome-wide, we performed Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) with H3K27me3, GATA1 or GATA1s antibodies on wild-type versus Gata1s expressing fetal erythroid cells. Our data indicated that there is a substantial reduction in H3K27me3 along regulatory elements of the Runx1 gene at the late stage (R3) of fetal erythropoiesis in Gata1s mice. Along with an increase in Runx1 expression we observed strong downregulation of Klf1 , a repressive target of RUNX1. Thus, failure of GATA1s to facilitate trimethylation of Runx1 and Gata2 regulatory elements appears to cause the defects in erythroid cell and megakaryocyte development. In parallel, we performed an in-depth analysis of the phenotype of adult Gata1s mice and discovered that they have reduced red cell counts, lower hemoglobin and hematocrit, increased extramedullary hematopoiesis and impaired stress erythropoiesis compared to control littermates. Although there were significantly more megakaryocyte erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs, Lin-c-Kit + Sca-1 - CD34 - FcgR - ) in Gata1s mouse bone marrow, there were fewer pre-colony-forming unit erythroid cells (preCFU-E, Lin - c-Kit + Sca-1 - CD41 - FcgR - CD150 hi CD105 hi ), likely at the expense of expanded megakaryocyte progenitors (MkP, Lin - c-Kit + Sca-1 - CD41 + CD150 hi ). Gata1s mice also developed an MDS-like disease with age. Together, our integrated genomic analysis of transcriptome, GATA1/GATA1s chromatin binding profile and chromatin signature reveal that, although Gata1s mice do not precisely model DBA, they provide novel insights into the role of the N-terminus of GATA1 in gene transcriptional regulation, lineage determination and red blood cell maturation.
