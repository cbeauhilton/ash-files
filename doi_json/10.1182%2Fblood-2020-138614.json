    "abstract_text": "Introduction To further improve efficacy and duration of response of CAR-T therapy for Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (R/R MM), we have designed a dual FasT CAR-T targeting both B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a well-established MM target, and CD19, which is expressed on MM cells and their progenitors. Here we report early results from the first-in-human multicenter clinical study (NCT04236011; NCT04182581) to determine safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of BCMA-CD19-directed FasT CAR-T (GC012F) in patients with R/R MM. Methods The BCMA-CD19 dual CAR was constructed by linking BCMA and CD19 scFv, joined by a CD8 hinge, transmembrane domain, co-stimulatory domain and CD3z. Peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells were obtained by leukapheresis, T cells were isolated and CAR-T cells were manufactured (FasT CAR platform). From September 2019 to April 2020, we enrolled 16 heavily pretreated R/R MM patients (Age range 27-71), with a median of 5 prior lines of therapies (range 2-7), 93.8% (15/16) of these patients were high risk as defined by mSMART criteria, 5 had extramedullary disease. 4 out of 16 patients had received prior anti CD38 therapy, 93.8% (15/16) patients had received prior IMiD, all patients received at least 1 prior PI and corticosteroids with 3 patients being primary refractory to last therapy. Prior to CAR-T infusion patients received a conditioning regimen over 3 days of 30 mg/m 2 /d fludarabine and 300 mg/m 2 /d cyclophosphamide. CAR-T cells were administered in a single infusion at 3 dose levels 1x10 5 /Kg (DL1) (1 patients), 2x10 5 /Kg (DL2) (9 patients) and 3x10 5 /Kg (DL3) (6 patients). Results As of July 17 th 2020, all 16 patients were evaluable for response assessment, 15 out of 16 patients responded to treatment (ORR 93.8%) in all dose levels with the earliest response observed at day 28. Best response to date is MRD- CR/sCR in 9/16 patients (56.3%). In DL3 100% (6/6) of patients achieved sCR, 3 at data cut off had been confirmed by PET-CT. In all response evaluable patients, 78.6% (11/14) were MRD- by flow at month 1, and 100% at month 3 (11/11) and 6 (10/10) (sensitivity by flow cytometry measured at 10 -4 in 7 patients, and at 10 -6 in 9 patients tested by EuroFlow with at least 1.08x10 7 cells analyzed). At data cut off, the median follow up time was 7.3 months, the longest follow up was 10 months post infusion. CAR-T PK in PB was monitored by qPCR and flow cytometry. The CAR-T median proliferation peak was reached on Day10 (Day8-Day14), and the median peak copy number was 140,982 (16,011-374,346) copies /ug DNA. GC012F showed an acceptable safety profile with 14 out of 16 patients experiencing a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) grade 1-2 (n=14, 87.5%) and 2 grade 3 (n=2, 12.5%). The median duration of CRS was 4 days (1-8 days). No neurotoxicity of any grade was observed. One patient (DL2) presented with fever and died shortly after Day 78 of unknown cause during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Two patients had progression of extramedullary disease while achieving MRD negativity at month 1 and 3, respectively. At landmark analysis at 6 months, all patients in DL3 had achieved and maintained MRD- sCR including patients heavily pretreated including Daratumumab - among them 83.3% (5/6) patients in DL3 had high risk features according to mSMART criteria, and 5 out of 6 patients in DL3 were assessed by 10 -6 Euroflow for MRD. The study is still enrolling patients and we will continue to be monitoring safety and efficacy including duration of response. Conclusion The data of BCMA-CD19 dual FasT CAR-T showed an early and high response rate with 93.8% ORR to date with a promising early high MRD-sCR rate in the highest dose level DL3 (100%) which was sustained with a median duration of follow up of 7.3 months at cut off. The data shows very promising activity of the BCMA-CD19 dual FasT CAR-T with a favorable safety profile in R/R MM patients. 93.8% (15/16) of the treated patients exhibited high risk features - a specifically difficult to treat patient population which remains a high unmet medical need in Multiple Myeloma. This data indicates that BCMA-CD19 dual FasT CAR-T (GC012F) may present an effective new treatment option for patients with R/R MM including those with high-risk features who failed multiple prior therapies including anti-CD38. The study is still ongoing and enrolling patients, we will update the results as they become available. Disclosures Zhao: Gracell Biotechnologies Ltd: Current Employment.
