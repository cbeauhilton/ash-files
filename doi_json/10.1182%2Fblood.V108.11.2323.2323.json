    "abstract_text": "C-1311 (Symadex\u2122) is the lead compound in clinical development from a new series of agents, the imidazoacridinones. It was previously reported that C-1311 was solely a topoisomerase II (TOP2) cleavable complex inhibitor and DNA damaging agent. However, contemporary analyses of C-1311 point to alternative structural parallelisms with the molecular scaffolds now seen as common motifs in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors. To investigate this mechanism of action, a kinase inhibitor screening program was initiated, first in silico by molecular similarity matching, and then in vitro against recombinant RTKs. C-1311 was identified to cluster with RTK inhibitors, especially when sunitinib is used as a molecular \u201cseed\u201d for pattern recognition. The statistical similarity coefficients fall in the 0.7\u20130.8 positive probability range, compared to 0.2\u20130.4 for the classical TOP2 inhibitors. C-1311 was found to selectively inhibit wild-type (WT) FLT3 and its D835Y mutant at nanomolar concentrations of 8\u201315 nM IC 50 . FGFR2 was also targeted at approximately 100-fold greater IC 50 value of 1.2 \u03bcM. Inhibition of PDGFR, FGFR1, and KIT was observed at about 3\u20134 \u03bcM IC 50 ; other prominent kinases had values of greater than 10 \u03bcM. As a part of the dual mechanism reexamination, TOP2 decatenation of kDNA, DNA relaxation, and competition assays were performed to assess C-1311 interaction with TOP2. Results confirmed that C-1311 is not a cleavable complex inhibitor when compared to etoposide, suggesting that it may not be an inducer of the MLL cleavage. Additionally, the IC 50 of C-1311 from the decatenation assay is 44 \u03bcM compared to 3, 12, and 149 \u03bcM for mitoxantrone, daunorubicin, and merbarone, respectively. Cellular screens were performed to assess the potency of C-1311 in myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cell lines. C-1311 was equally effective in both WT FLT3 expressing (RS4;11) and mutant FLT3 expressing (MV-4\u201311) cell lines. The dual function of C-1311 may contribute to the potency in these cell lines. These findings warrant further investigation of C-1311 in yet unexplored indications, including other hematological malignancies."
