    "abstract_text": "Background: Chronic red cell transfusions in patients with MDS result in iron overload, potentially causing hepatic, cardiac and endocrine dysfunction if untreated. DFX, a once-daily, oral iron chelator, has demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in SF and LIC in a variety of iron-overloaded patients. This study, CICL670AUS02, is the first prospective study evaluating the effects of DFX on LIC, SF and LPI in lower-risk patients with MDS. Methods: The study evaluated efficacy and safety of DFX in patients with IPSS Low- and Int-1-risk MDS at three US centers. Initial DFX dose was 20 mg/kg/day with adjustments to 10 or 30 mg/kg/day based on safety and efficacy. LIC was assessed by R2 MRI at baseline (BL), 6 and 12 months (mos). SF, safety analyses and trough LPI levels were also assessed. Baseline characteristics (n=24): Male/female ratio: 16/8; all Caucasian; mean age: 68 years (range 55\u201381); IPSS Low: 10; Int-1: 14. Time from initial diagnosis: 0.5 \u03bcmol/L). 6-month values: 15/24 patients completed 6 mos. Mean SF (\u00b1SEM): 3650\u00b1384 \u03bcg/L at BL, 3638\u00b1870 \u03bcg/L at 6 mos (n=13); mean decrease of 12.2 \u03bcg/L ( P =0.685). Mean LIC (\u00b1SEM): 23.10\u00b12.40 mg Fe/g dw at BL, 16.87\u00b11.88 mg Fe/g dw at 6 mos (n=14); mean decrease of 6.2 mg Fe/g dw ( P =0.013). Mean LPI (\u00b1SEM): 0.82\u00b10.16 \u03bcmol/L at BL, 0.12 \u00b1 0.05 \u03bcmol/L at 6 mos (n=15); mean decrease of 0.70 \u03bcmol/L ( P =0.170). 12-month values (n=9): Nine patients completed 12 mos of treatment. Mean dose in the nine completers was 20.1 mg/kg/day; three patients increased to 30 mg/kg/day and two decreased to 10 mg/kg/day. Mean SF (\u00b1SEM): 4416\u00b11269 \u03bcg/L at BL, 2685\u00b1316 \u03bcg/L at 12 mos; mean decrease of 1730 \u03bcg/L ( P =0.301; Figure). Mean LIC (\u00b1SEM): 23.72\u00b13.82 mg Fe/g dw at BL, 16.79\u00b13.80 mg Fe/g dw at 12 mos; mean decrease of 6.93 mg Fe/g dw ( P =0.203). 78% of the nine completers achieved decreases in SF of \u2265500 \u03bcg/L and >20% from BL. Mean LPI (\u00b1SEM; n=8): 0.82\u00b10.19 \u03bcmol/L at BL, 0.13\u00b10.10 \u03bcmol/L at 12 mos; mean decrease of 0.76 \u03bcmol/L ( P =0.023) Safety Analysis (n=24): Increases in serum creatinine (SCr) to >33% above BL on \u22652 occasions (highest value 1.7 mg/dL) were seen in seven patients (29%) while on study. New cases of thrombocytopenia (worst value 39\u00d710 9 /L) and neutropenia (worst value 0.50\u00d710 9 /L) developed in one patient each during the study; these were assessed as unrelated to study drug. There were 15 discontinuations (63%): three due to unrelated deaths (two congestive cardiac failure, one subdural hemorrhage); four patients withdrew consent for unknown reasons; two from MDS progression; five because of adverse events (AEs), four of which were related to study drug (one diarrhea, two increased SCr, one increased liver enzymes) and one unrelated (splenic infarct); and one from unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. There were 14 serious AEs reported in 11 patients; 13/14 were considered unrelated to study drug; 1/14 (severe diarrhea/lower abdominal cramping) was related to study drug and the patient completely recovered within 1 day. Conclusions: Sequential LIC measurements in this MDS cohort demonstrated a significant decrease by month 6 and further decreases by month 12 in patients who completed 1 year of treatment. LPI normalized in 80% of the patients. Two thirds of this heavily transfused population discontinued the trial mainly due to disease-related complications; four patients discontinued due to drug-related AEs. Larger studies are continuing to evaluate the clinical benefit of DFX in patients with MDS. View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure "
