    "abstract_text": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is one of most common leukemia, although target therapy with imatinib is significant improved the survival rate, disease relapse and drug resistant with abl gene mutant are still the major clinical problem, improvement strategy to reverse the outcome of CML is the key point for the researchers. T-cell immunodeficiency was suggested in tumor patients for many years, understanding T cell immune status in leukemia patients might suggest treatment strategies to enhance immune competence in all. In order to investigate the clonal expansion and the feature of CDR3 sequence of T cells in patients with CML, the CDR3 of TCR V\u03b1 29 and TCR V\u03b2 24 subfamily genes were amplified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from two case with CML using RT-PCR, the PCR products were further analyzed by genescan technique to evaluate clonality of the detectable TCR V\u03b1 and V\u03b2 subfamilies. The oligoclonal PCR products were analyzed by sequencing to define the sequence of CDR3. Oligoclonal V\u03b221 T cells could be identified in both CML cases , which might partner with different oligoclonal V\u03b1 subfamilies, including V\u03b17, V\u03b113 or V\u03b118. The CDR3 sequences from two V\u03b221 and three V\u03b1 oligoclonal TCR genes were identified in V\u03b221ND\u03b2NJ\u03b21.1, V\u03b221ND\u03b2NJ\u03b22.7, V\u03b17NJ\u03b123, V\u03b113NJ\u03b149, V\u03b118NJ\u03b15 respectively. The length and motifs of CDR3 seem different in all five TCR genes, however, the motifs in both V\u03b221 genes (GAV or LRV) share the valine as last residue of CDR3 motif, and all of three V\u03b1 gene (V\u03b17:G; V\u03b113:GDEAD or V\u03b118:GG ) share the Glycine as first residue in the CDR3 motif. All of five TCR sequences were already submitted to the Genbank (Accession No: EU395806 , EU379940 , FJ009444 , EU589347 or EU770971 respectively). The results indicated that oligoclonal V\u03b221 genes with different V\u03b1 partners which share part of CDR3 motifs might recognize the similar CML associated antigen epitope in CML patients. Farther investigation will be constructed the recombination vector containing the antigen specific TCRs for gene transfer to establish TCR modified-T cells, which was expected to employ for specific immunotherapy in CML."
