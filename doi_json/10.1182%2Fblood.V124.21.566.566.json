    "abstract_text": "Background . Serine-threonine protein kinase CK2 has been recently involved in the pathogenesis of B-cell tumors, such as B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma. CK2 acts through a \u201cnon-oncogene\u201d addiction mechanism to propel tumor growth, protecting from apoptosis by a phosphorylation-dependent \u201cshielding\u201d mechanism of pro-survival molecules and stimulating oncogenic kinases by helping folding and enzymatic activity. In addition, CK2 has been shown to enhance the transactivation potential of several transcription factors, such as STAT3, NF-\u03baB and c-Myc. The existing data on CK2 function in B cell tumors suggest that this kinase might act as a \u201chub\u201d downstream signals from surface membrane molecules, like the B-cell (BCR), growth factor and cytokine receptors, as well as from cell-intrinsic pathways \u2013 like proteotoxic and DNA-damage-related stress cascades. Aims and methods . To gain insights into the role of CK2 in B-lymphopoiesis and, consequently, in B-cell tumors, we generated CK2\u03b2 conditional knockout (KO) mice in B-cells by crossing Csnk2\u03b2-Flox/Flox mice with CD19-CRE transgenic mice. Results . CK2 kinase activity was decreased in Csnk2\u03b2 KO B cells. In the bone marrow (BM), Csnk2\u03b2 KO mice displayed a reduction of B-cells, especially of the B220 high IgM int-high recirculating population of transitional and follicular (FO) B cells. Pro-B and pre-B-cell progenitors were slightly reduced in number. In peripheral blood, lymph-nodes, spleen and peritoneal cavity the number of B-cells was markedly reduced. Csnk2\u03b2 KO mice had lower levels of all the immunoglobulin classes in the serum. The splenic IgD low IgM high B-cell subset was increased whereas the IgD high IgM int-low population was decreased. An imbalance between the amount of FO and marginal zone (MZ) B-cells was found with an absolute reduction of FO B cells by approximately 2-folds and an increase of MZ B-cells and MZB cell precursors by up to three folds, on average. Histological and immunofluorescence (IF) analysis revealed a change of size/shape of spleen follicles and a significant expansion of the inter-follicular, marginal zone areas, which appeared to invade the follicle with larger cells. In vitro class-switch recombination assays demonstrated impairment in IgG 1 and IgG 3 class-switch and a marked reduction of the generation of antibody-producing cells . Anti-IgM stimulation was uncoupled to Ca++ mobilization, indicating a disrupted transmission of the signal from the BCR to the release of Ca++ stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. In vivo sheep red blood cells (SRBC) treatment (T-cell dependent response) showed a conserved up-regulation of GC markers, such as CD38, GL7 and PNA. Nonetheless, the architecture of the reactive follicles was found markedly changed. The analysis of FO, GC and MZ-associated genes showed normal levels of Bcl6, elevated levels of Lrf mRNA and, more significantly, a marked up-regulation of Notch2 target genes, such as Hes1 and Deltex1, in Csnk2\u03b2 KO B cells. In vivo Notch2 blockage with neutralizing antibodies markedly reduced the MZB cell number in Csnk2\u03b2 KO mice, indicating a Notch2-dependent MZB expansion associated with Csnk2\u03b2 loss. High throughput RNAseq analysis was also performed and revealed significant alteration in FOB and MZB-regulating pathways. Conclusions . Here, we found that the \u03b2 subunit of protein kinase CK2 is a novel regulator of peripheral B cell differentiation. CK2\u03b2 sustains a proper BCR signal, controls the GC reaction and negatively regulates Notch2 signaling, acting as a master regulator of follicular/marginal zone architecture and terminal homeostasis of FOB and MZB cells. On one side our data enrich the knowledge on the mechanisms regulating B cell development, on the other side they inform about the potential mechanisms altered by CK2 during B-cell tumorigenesis.
