    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2834 Background: A phase 2 study of flavopiridol administered according to a pharmacokinetically- (PK-) derived schedule has demonstrated significant activity in CLL, irrespective of high-risk genomic features. In combination with fludarabine and rituximab, flavopiridol has further shown promising activity in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). However, the safety and efficacy of single-agent flavopiridol administered on this schedule has not yet been characterized in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL. Methods: We conducted a standard cohorts-of-3 phase 1 trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of single-agent flavopiridol in each of 4 groups: indolent B-NHL, aggressive B-NHL, MCL, and T-NHL. Adult patients (age >18y) with previously-treated (T-NHL '1 prior; B-NHL \u22652 prior), preserved end-organ function, adequate hematologic parameters (unless attributable to disease), and preserved performance status (\u2264ECOG 2) were eligible. Further, pts were only eligible if they had exhausted all other therapeutic options. All pts signed informed consent. Flavopiridol was given as a 30 min loading dose followed by a 4 hr infusion weekly for 4 weeks of a 6 week cycle (max 6 cycles). Dose levels (DL) 1, 2, and 3 were 30 mg/m 2 + 30 mg/m 2 , 30 mg/m 2 + 50 mg/m 2 , and 50 mg/m 2 + 50 mg/m 2 , respectively. The first infusion was administered in hospital, but treatment could continue outpatient thereafter. Pts received allopurinol, phosphate binders, and Kayexalate (if pre-treatment K + >4.5) prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Steroid pre-medication and/or treatment for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was given at the discretion of the treating clinician. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was generally defined as any grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity not resolving to \u2264grade 2 within 2 wks or any grade 4 hematologic toxicity (except leukopenia/neutropenia) resulting in >1 wk treatment delay. Results: 28 pts evaluable for toxicity have thus far completed cycle 1, which was used to define DLT: median age 66 years (range 34\u201384), 13 female (46%), median prior therapies 3 (range 1\u20138). All B-NHL patients received prior rituximab. Subsequent dose evaluation continues in the MCL and T-NHL arms. Across all pt groups, there were 11 pts at DL 1, 11 pts at DL 2, and 6 pts at DL 3. No DLTs have been observed to date. Median number of cycles received was 2. Seven pts completed all 6 cycles: 4 pts 30+30, 2 pts 30+50, 1 pt 50+50. Although no DLTs were observed, grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity was seen in 26 pts: neutropenia (23 pts), thrombocytopenia (3 pts), and anemia (7 pts). Grade 3 neutropenic fever and infection, however, were only observed in 2 and 5 pts, respectively. Common grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities included diarrhea (15 pts), fatigue (8 pts) and elevated transaminases (3 pts). Grade 3 CRS and TLS occurred in only 2 pts, both during cycle 1. Only 2 grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities (elevated transaminases, elevated lipase) were observed, both of which resolved without sequelae. Among pts completing \u22651 cycle, the most common reason for discontinuing treatment was disease progression (17 pts). One pt withdrew after diagnosis of a second cancer, 2 pts proceeded to transplant, and 2 pts withdrew for toxicity (1 persistent fatigue, 1 persistently elevated transaminases/malaise). Four pts expired on study: 3 progression, 1 sudden cardiac death unrelated to flavopiridol. Of 26 pts evaluable for response, 6 pts (21%) had partial responses: 2 follicular (30+30, 30+50), 1 SLL (50+50), 2 MCL (30+30, 30+50), and 1 DLBCL (50+50). Seven pts had stable disease for \u22651 cycle: 1 follicular (30+50), 1 MCL (30+30), 1 Richter's CLL (30+30), 1 DLBCL (50+50), and 3 PTCL (2 pts 30+30, 1 pt 30+50). Conclusions: Administered according to a PK-derived schedule, single-agent flavopiridol can be successfully delivered to multiply relapsed and/or refractory NHL pts with acceptable hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity. Both the promising activity and relative safety observed in these heavily pre-treated NHL pts warrant further investigation of this agent earlier in the course of disease and/or in combination with other agents, particularly in indolent B-cell and mantle cell NHL.
