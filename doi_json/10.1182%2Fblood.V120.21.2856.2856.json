    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2856 Germline and somatic mutations (heterozygous) in Ptpn11 (Shp2), a protein tyrosine phosphatase implicated in multiple cell signaling processes, have been identified in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), a childhood myeloproliferative disease (MPD), and pediatric acute leukemias. These mutations cause hyperactivation of Shp2 catalytic activity and enhance the binding of mutant Shp2 to signaling partners. Ptpn11 mutations are sufficient to drive the development of JMML-like MPD and acute leukemias in mice, suggesting that they play a causal role in the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies. However, the mechanisms by which Ptpn11 mutations induce these malignancies are not completely understood and the signaling partners that mediate the pathogenic effects of Ptpn11 mutations have not been explored. We previously generated a line of conditional knock-in mice with Ptpn11 E76K mutation, the most common and most active Ptpn11 mutation found in JMML and acute leukemias. Induced knock-in of this mutation in hematopoietic cells resulted in MPD with full penetrance as a result of aberrant activation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid progenitors (J. Exp. Med., 2011). Recently, we discovered that the interaction between Shp2 E76K and Gab2, a prominent interacting protein of Shp2 and a scaffolding protein important for cytokine-induced PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, was greatly enhanced, and that mTOR was highly activated in Ptpn11 E76K/ + MPD cells. To address the role of Gab2 and mTOR in the pathogenesis of Ptpn11 E76K/ + mutation-induced MPD, Ptpn11 E76K/ + /Gab2 -/- double mutant mice were generated and their phenotypes were compared with those of Ptpn11 E76K/ + single mutant mice. MPD phenotypes were markedly attenuated in Ptpn11 E76K/ + / Gab2 -/- double mutant mice. Overproduction of myeloid cells in the bone marrow was alleviated, and splenomegaly was diminished in the double mutants. Myeloid cell infiltration in the liver also decreased. Cytokine (IL-3 and GM-CSF) sensitivity of myeloid progenitors was significantly decreased in Ptpn11 E76K/ + /Gab2 \u2212/\u2212 mice as compared to that in Ptpn11 E76K/ + mice. Hyperactivation of HSCs and excessive myeloid differentiation caused by Ptpn11 E76K mutation were largely corrected by deletion of Gab2. Furthermore, we treated Ptpn11 E76K/ + mice with Rapmycin, a specific and potent mTOR inhibitor, which substantially diminished MPD phenotypes. Collectively, this study reveals the essential role of the Gab2/PI3K/mTOR pathway in mediating the pathogenic effects of Ptpn11 E76K/ + mutation and suggests that Gab2 and mTOR are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of Ptpn11 -associated hematological malignancies.
