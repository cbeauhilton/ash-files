    "abstract_text": "We have found that CLL B cells spontaneously secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and that a VEGF autocrine pathway can induce apoptosis resistance in these cells. Recently, we also found that hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) is highly expressed in CLL B cells. Since this protein is a potent transcription factor for the induction of VEGF, we were interested in further definition of HIF-1\u03b1 regulation and its function in CLL B cells. CLL blood B cells overexpress HIF-1\u03b1 protein but not mRNA for HIF-1\u03b1 compared to normal blood and splenic B cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that circulating blood CLL B cells and a subset of CLL marrow cells uniformly express HIF. Hypoxic conditions (i.e., 1% O 2 ) did not increase the protein levels of HIF-1\u03b1 nor mRNA for HIF-1\u03b1 in CLL B cells, indicating that the high HIF-1\u03b1 protein level is due to post-translation modification. Blockade of signaling pathways known to increase HIF-1\u03b1 levels also did not alter the high levels of HIF-1\u03b1 in CLL B cells. IHC and nuclear extraction assay demonstrated that HIF-1\u03b1 was predominantly located in the CLL B cell nucleus. In addition, the nuclear extract when immunoprecipitated for HIF-1\u03b1 was shown to be complexed with the co-activator p300, indicating that HIF-1\u03b1 is transcriptionally active. Co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that HIF-1\u03b1 from CLL B cells does not associate and form a complex with von Hippel-Landau protein tumor suppressor (pVHL), indicating that the proteasome dependent degradation pathway for HIF-1\u03b1 protein in CLL B cells is dysfunctional. Using immunoblot or IHC methods, we were unable to detect pVHL protein in CLL B cells; however, we were able to use immunoprecipitation of CLL B cell lysates to demonstrate there is pVHL in CLL B cells. Prolyl hydroxylases (PHD 1, 2, and 3) are negative regulators for HIF-1\u03b1 via hydroxylation of amino acid prolines in the oxygen degradation domain (ODD) which permits interaction with pVHL. RT-PCR results revealed that there is a subset of CLL patients who had \u2265 50% reduction of PHD 1 and 3 mRNA levels. However using a hydroxylation specific polyclonal antibody we found that HIF-1\u03b1 from CLL B cells is indeed hydroxylated. Finally, silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 by RNA interference in CLL B cells was associated with a selective decrease in VEGF mRNA levels but not VEGF-R1, Mcl-1 and prolyl hydroxylases (PHD 1\u20133) other downstream target genes of HIF-1\u03b1. These data show that the high endogenous HIF-1\u03b1 levels in CLL B cells are due to a defect in HIF-1\u03b1 degradation via the proteosomal pathway. We believe that this abnormality is linked to the autocrine VEGF pathway in CLL B cells and ultimately results in increases in their apoptotic resistance. Inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 levels may be of therapeutic benefit to CLL patients."
