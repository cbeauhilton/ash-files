    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4429 DNA hypermethylation has important implications in the tumorigenesis and prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To identify relevant methylated genes in AML, we have compared several expression and methylation profilings. With expression analysis, we identified that TRPC6, DBC1, DCC and SOX9 have decreased expression levels in the most analyzed AML cell lines. Among these candidates, DBC1 (deleted bladder cancer 1), a putative tumor suppressor, drew our attention because it is frequently methylated not only in hematological malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but also in epithelial cancers. DBC1 may play an important role in the regulation of cell growth and programmed cell death. But the mechanisms of transcriptional control and function role in the hematological malignancies, especially on acute myeloid leukemia, are not well known. In this study, we analyzed the DBC1 expression pattern in 9 AML cell lines with RT-PCR analysis. DBC1 mRNA expression was observed in normal bone-marrow but diminished expression in all of 9 AML cell lines. DBC1 methylation was frequently observed in AML cells (9 of 9, 100%) and inversely correlated with DBC1 mRNA expression in a COBRA analysis (Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis). We also detected a frequent methylation of DBC1 in primary AML patient samples (9 of 9, 100%). These findings indicate that DBC1 is frequently silenced by hypermethylation in AML. We are in the process of investigation the functional role of DBC1 in the pathogenesis. In addition, diagnostic and prognostic values of DBC1 in AML are being pursued.* Chen Zhao and Aili Dai contributed equally to the presented work.
