    "abstract_text": "Macrophages (M\u03a6) are professional phagocytes in the innate immune system. They are not only involved in regulation of various immune functions and inflammation, but also exhibit plasticity in modulation of tissue regeneration and repair after being polarized into M1 and M2 M\u03a6 by different inflammatory cytokines. In addition, several recent studies show that M\u03a6 are a new constituent of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) niche and play a role in regulation of HSCs maintenance and mobilization in bone marrow (BM). However, it is not known whether M\u03a6 can regulate HSCs self-renewal and whether the effects of M\u03a6 on HSCs can be influenced by differential M\u03a6 polarization. This was investigated using an ex vivo HSCs expansion model consisting of mouse bone marrow LSK (Lin - sca-1 + c-Kit + ) cells cultured with or without M\u03a6 in a mouse HSCs expansion medium (StemSpan TM serum-free medium supplemented with 20ng/ml of stem cell factor [SCF] and thrombopoietin [TPO]). We found that LSK cells were expanded about 20-, 15-, and 30-fold after 6 days of co-culture with M\u03a6 harvested from mouse BM, spleen, and peritoneal cavity, respectively, whereas there was no significant expansion after culture without M\u03a6 or with BM Gr-1 high or Gr-1 low monocytes. In addition, we found that M1-M\u03a6 polarized by INF\u03b3 were more effective than IL4-polarized M2-M\u03a6 in promoting LSK cells expansion ex vivo (45-fold vs. 15-fold). However, the promotion of LSK cells expansion by M1-M\u03a6 resulted in about 88% reduction in HSCs as judged by 5-week cobblestone area forming cell (CAFC) assay. In contrast, M2-M\u03a6 significantly promoted HSCs expansion. A greater expansion of HSCs was achieved after LSK cells were co-cultured with M2-M\u03a6 for 9 days than for 6 days (20-fold vs. 6-fold). These findings suggest that M1-M\u03a6 are more effective than M2-M\u03a6 in promoting LSK cells or hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) expansion, at the expense of HSCs self-renewal, whereas M2-M\u03a6 can promote HPCs expansion as well as HSCs self-renewal. This suggestion is supported by results of serial transplantation and competitive repopulation unit (CRU) assays. CRU assay showed that LT-HSCs (e.g. 4-month CRU) were increased about 13 folds relative to the starting numbers of CRU in the input after LSK cells were co-cultured with M2-M\u03a6 for 9 days, but were barely detectable after the cells were cultured without M\u03a6 or with M1-M\u03a6. The inhibitory effect of M1-M\u03a6 on HSCs self-renewal and expansion was attenuated by inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity with an inhibitor or knockout iNOS. Inhibition of arginase and/or cyclooxygenase activities with an inhibitor attenuated the promotion of HSCs self-renewal and expansion by M2-M\u03a6. More importantly, we found that human CD34 + cells, 8-week CAFC, and SCID mice repopulating cells (SRCs) were increased 42\u00b114, 8\u00b12.1, and 4 folds over the input values, respectively, after human cord blood CD34 + cells were co-cultured with M2-M\u03a6 generated from human cord blood CD34 - cells for 7 days in a human HSCs expansion medium (StemSpan TM serum-free medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml of SCF, TPO, and FLT-3 ligand). These findings demonstrate that M1-M\u03a6 and M2-M\u03a6 have opposite effects on HSCs self-renewal, which may be important for regulation of hematopoiesis under various pathological conditions in which M\u03a6 are differentially polarized to M1 or M2 by diverse inflammatory cytokines. In addition, M2-M\u03a6 may be used to promote human cord blood HSCs ex vivo expansion to make human cord blood transplantation available to more patients.
