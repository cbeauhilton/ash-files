    "abstract_text": "Purpose The study is conducted in 29 sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients, who are in ischemic attacks (in vasoocclusive crises period) and in steady state; the level of T helper cells, cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells were determined and the effect of ischemic attack on clinical prognosis and the immune functions. Materials and Methods In the study, 29 patients with sickle cell anemia in ischemic attacks with painful crises and in steady state and 24 healthy children were chosen in the same age group for control group. These groups were examined with complete blood cells count, Hb electrophoreses and the blood biochemistry. The study was performed by flowcytometric method to find the level of CD3 monoclonal antibody for total T lymphocyte, CD4 monoclonal antibody for T helper cells, CD8 monoclonal antibody for cytotoxic T cells and CD16+56 monoclonal antibodies for natural killer cells in the mentioned groups to compare the statistical data. Findings The average of HbS in ischemic periods in SCA patients are to be found 83\u00b16,6 %. There were decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in SCA versus control group (p0,05). Results As a result of the study, in the patients with sickle cell anemia whom associated with chronic hemolysis and tissue hypoxia during the ischemic attack, the levels of total T lymphocyte (CD3) was found significantly lower than the control groupp<0.001. The levels of T helper cells (CD4) and cytotoxic T cells (CD8) did not differ between SCA patients and control group. The levels of natural killer cells (CD16+56) was found higher in crises period and steady state than control group. To find the T cell subset levels in clinical and prognostic effects in SCA, it is necessary to do study with bigger groups of patients and wide range of study.
