    "abstract_text": "Conventional immunoglobulin (Ig) markers have been used to define multiple myeloma (MM) responses, but assessment of marrow for minimal residual disease (MRD) may provide better information on disease status/prognosis (Paiva B, et al. Blood 2008; 112: 4017). We therefore initiated a national multi-center ASCT trial with the goal of producing a high rate of MRD-negativity by using bortezomib (btz)-based induction, enhancing the conditioning regimen and utilizing post-ASCT maintenance. This phase 2 open label-trial was conducted in 10 Canadian centers. After btz-based induction (usually CyBorD) in the absence of disease progression, patients (pts) received BuMel conditioning (IV busulfan 3.2 mg/kg days -5 to -3 or days -6 to -4 + melphalan 140 mg/m 2 day -2 or day -3), followed by ASCT on day 0. On day 100 post-ASCT, lenalidomide (len) 10 mg/day was commenced, escalated to 15 mg/day after 3 cycles if appropriate, and continued until disease progression. Bone marrow aspirate (BMA) samples were shipped centrally for MRD analysis by 15-color multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) before any therapy, prior to ASCT, on day 100 post-ASCT, every 3 mos for the 1 st year and every 6 mos thereafter until progression. Between 03/2013 - 07/2014, 99 newly diagnosed MM pts provided untreated BMA samples for MRD analysis. To date, 42 of a planned target of 78 pts have completed induction therapy have undergone ASCT and 39 are evaluable so far. 25 of the 99 (25%) who provided initial marrow samples did not meet criteria for enrollment: 3 (3%) had poor BMA samples; 3 (3%) did not have confirmed MM; 6 (6%) did not proceed with ASCT (1 due to progression); 1 (1%) had received dexamethasone prior to MRD analysis; 1 (1%) died during induction and 11 (11%) withdrew consent/opted for standard conditioning. Median age of the 39 evaluable pts is 53 (39-67); 64% are male. Median serum \u03b22-microglobulin level is 3.64 mg/L (1.7-20) and albumin 37 g/L (2.8-48.1); 17 pts have ISS stage I; 9 have stage II; 9 have stage III MM and 4 have missing data. Ig subtype includes IgG\u03ba in 16 (40%), IgG\u03bb in 4 (10%), IgA\u03ba in 5 (13%), IgA\u03bb in 8 (21%), IgM\u03bb in 1 (3%), \u03ba in 1 (3%); non-secretory in 2 (5%) and no data in 2 pts (5%). Post-ASCT, only 4 SAEs have occurred: atrial fibrillation (2), acute kidney injury (1) and sepsis (1). There have been no ASCT-related deaths, and no pt has progressed at a median follow-up of 7.8 mos (range: 4.8-10.1). The best Ig response post-induction in the 31 pts with available restaging data is CR in 5 (16%), VGPR in 9 (29%), PR in 13 (42%), and SD in 1 (3%). 27 pts have reached day 100 post-ASCT and 8 pts have been formally evaluated. In these 8, the Ig response is CR in 2 (25%), VGPR in 5 (63%) and PR in 1 (12%). Table 1 summarizes MRD results to date. Table 1.
