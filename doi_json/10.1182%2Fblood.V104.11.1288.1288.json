    "abstract_text": "Mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are multipotent stem cells that have the capacity to differentiate into various lineages. These cells provide stromal support and can be utilized as a feeder layer for expansion of hematopoitic stem cells and embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, allo-transplanted MSCs are not rejected and have been shown to mediate immuno-modulatory functions in vitro . Also, MSCs have been found at the wound site at extended times. The mechanisms underlying MSC migration and immuno-modulation are still under investigation. Aim : To understand the factors involved in human MSC (hMSC) migration and their interaction with various immune cell types. Methods : Human MSCs were examined for the presence of cell surface receptors that may play a role in migration using quantitative RT-PCR. Next, hMSCs were co-cultured with purified immune cell types including dendritic cells (DCs), nai\u0308ve T cells and NK cells. Following the co-culture, changes in the phenotype of the immune cells under activating conditions were analyzed using ELISA and functional assays. Results : Human MSCs express Toll receptors, especially TLR4, on their cell surface. The TLR4 on hMSCs is functional as seen by a several-fold increase in IL-6 and chemokine IL-8 upon incubation with TLR4 exogenous ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the endogenous ligand, soluble hyaluronic acid (sHA). When hMSCs were incubated with activated dendritic cells, there was a >50% decrease in TNF-\u03b1 secretion and a >50% increase in IL-10 secretion. When hMSCs were incubated with nai\u0308ve T cells, hMSCs decreased IFN-\u03b3 secretion and increased IL-4 secretion. Decreased IFN-\u03b3 was also seen when MSCs were incubated with NK cells. Conclusion : These results suggest that (i) hMSCs may respond to the signals generated by breakdown products of extracellular matrix (e.g. sHA) via TLR4 and assist in wound healing (ii) hMSCs immuno-modulatory effects are mediated by interacting with various immune cell types and altering their phenotypic response to a more tolerant and anti-inflammatory response.",
