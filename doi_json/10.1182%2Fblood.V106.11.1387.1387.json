    "abstract_text": "Homing of transplanted hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the bone marrow (BM) is a prerequisite for establishment of hematopoiesis following transplantation. However, although multiple adhesive interactions of HSCs with BM microenviroment are thought to critically influence their homing and subsequently their engraftment, the molecular pathways that control the homing of transplanted HSCs, in particular, of fetal HSCs are still not well understood. In experimental mouse stem cell transplantation models, several integrins have been shown to be involved in the homing and engraftment of both adult and fetal stem and progenitor cells in BM. We have previously found that integrin a6 mediates human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell adhesion to and migration on its specific ligands, laminin-8 and laminin-10/11 in vitro ( Gu et al, Blood , 2003 ; 101 : 877 ). Furthermore, integrin a6 is required for adult mouse HSC homing to BM in vivo (Qian et al., Abstract American Society of Hematology, Blood 2004 ). We have now found that the integrin a6 chain like in adult HSC is ubiquitously (>99%) expressed also in fetal liver hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (lin \u2212 Sca-1 + c-Kit + , LSK ). In vitro, fetal liver LSK cells adhere to laminin-10/11 and laminin-8 in an integrin a6b1 receptor-dependent manner, as shown by function blocking monoclonal antibodies. We have now used a function blocking monoclonal antibody (GoH3) against integrin a6 to analyse the role of the integrin a6 receptor for the in vivo homing of fetal liver hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to BM. The integrin a6 antibody inhibited homing of fetal liver progenitors (CFU-C) into BM of lethally irradiated recipients. The number of homed CFU-C in BM was reduced by about 40% as compared to the cells incubated with an isotype matched control antibody. To study homing of long-term repopulating stem cells, BM cells were first incubated with anti-integrin alpha 6 or anti-integrin alpha 4 or control antibody, and then injected intravenously into lethally irradiated primary recipients. After three hours, BM cells of the primary recipients were analysed by competitive repopulation assay in secondary recipients. Blood analysis up to 16 weeks after transplantation showed that no reduction of stem cell reconstitution from integrin a6 antibody treated cells as compared to cells treated with control antibody. In accordance with this, fetal liver HSC from integrin a6 gene deleted embryos did not show any impairment of homing and engraftment in BM as compared to normal littermates. These results suggest that integrin a6 plays an important developmentally regulated role for homing of distinct hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell populations in vivo.",
