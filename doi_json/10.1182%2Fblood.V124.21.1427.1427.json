    "abstract_text": "Cord blood (CB) T cells are known to be na\u00efve cells, but can be activated to respond similar to adult peripheral blood (PB) T cells. Reports indicate that culture with aminobisphosphonate (NBP) stimulates CB gamma delta T cell proliferation ex vivo, specifically the TCR\u03b39\u03b42 subset, which has been extensively studied in PB gamma delta T cells. As CB gamma delta T cells are not well described, we compared CB gamma delta T cell proliferation, phenotype and genotype to PB gamma delta T cells when culturing cells with the NBP, Zometa (zoledronic acid), and IL-2. Fourteen days in culture resulted in significant fold increase in the proliferation of gamma delta T cells and in the percent of lymphocytes in both sample types. PB gamma delta T cells proliferated more robustly than CB with a 288.60 versus 21.32 fold increase, respectively. Additionally, in freshly isolated samples, CB gamma delta T cells comprised an average of 1.404% of the lymphocyte population, which was similar to PB gamma delta T cells, with an average of 2.319%. However, by day 14, PB gamma delta T cells increased to 70.15% of lymphocytes whereas CB gamma delta T cells increased to 12.49%. Phenotypically, both CB and PB had similar percent of CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ gamma delta T cell memory subsets in freshly isolated samples. Following culture, PB gamma delta T cells were mostly CD45RO+ memory cells, with significantly fewer CD45RA+ na\u00efve cells, whereas more CB gamma delta T cells were of the intermediate CD45RA+CD45RO+ subset. Further phenotypic analysis of the memory subsets indicated that cultured PB gamma delta T cells were either effector memory cells (CD27-CD45RA-) or central memory cells (CD27+CD45RA-), while CB gamma delta T cells were mostly na\u00efve (CD27+CD45RA+). The cytokines secreted by these cells were also assessed and the culture of PB and CB gamma delta T cells resulted in differing cytokine secretion profiles. After 14 days of culture, PB gamma delta T cells secreted more IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1, while CB gamma delta T cells secreted more IL-10 and RANTES. We also examined TCR\u03b39 and TCR\u03b42 phenotypic expression and found that the TCR\u03b39\u03b42 was a common clone in freshly isolated PB gamma delta T cells, which predominated after 14 days in culture. However, while the TCR\u03b39\u03b42 variant was expressed in CB gamma delta T cells, it was low before and after culture, suggesting that Zometa may not stimulate gamma delta T cells in CB the same as PB. As limited TCR\u03b3\u03b4 phenotypic reagents are available, we developed a single cell PCR assay for genotypic analysis of the TCR\u03b3\u03b4 repertoire. PCR analysis suggests that the TCR\u03b3\u03b4 repertoire is diverse in both samples, yet TCR\u03b39\u03b42 is most prevalent. Further analysis of the variant subsets is warranted and may give insight into how each of these receptor pairings affects function. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
