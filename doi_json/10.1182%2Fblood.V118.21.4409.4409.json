    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4409 Chromosomal translocations occur frequently in hematological malignancies, which might involve in cell transformation and initiation of malignancy. In T-cell malignancies, the chromosomal aberrations are more complex due to the TCR gene rearrangements during T-cell differentiation, which provide different breakpoints for the gene recombination. The chromosomal translocations that occur in the cases of T-cell acute lymphocatic leukemia (T-ALL) frequently involve the juxtaposition of enhancer elements and strong promoter from T-cell receptor (TCR) genes on chromosome 14 ( TCRA and TCRD ) and chromosome 7 ( TCRB and TCRG ) with transcription factors genes. Using a novel rapid approach of fine-tiling array comparative genomic hybridization (fine-tiling aCGH) with the array coving the TCR&brkbar;A\u0301&brkbar;A\u0308, TCR&brkbar;A\u0303 and TCR&brkbar;A\u0302 loci, chromosomal alterations were analyzed and the breakpoints and their position in the chromosomes in genomic DNA were identified from patients with T-ALL. Combining with ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) and sequencing techniques, we clarified at the molecular level novel chromosomal translocation t(X;14)(q11.2;q11), inv(14)(q11;q11), t(1;14)(p32;q11), inv(14)(q11;q32) and t(7;14)(q34;q32) in 4 cases with T-ALL. which caused a V&brkbar;A\u030137 segment fused to ZFRP1 gene locus, J&brkbar;A\u030161 segment fused to RPSAP4 gene locus, V&brkbar;A\u030220 segment rearranged to Ig&brkbar;E\u0302 gene segment and so on. The biological function of the novel fusion genes is needed further research.
