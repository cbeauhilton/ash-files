    "abstract_text": "Background: Traditionally, pre-transplant conditioning regimen is given over 4-6 days before hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Delivering higher dose chemotherapy preparative regimen over a longer time period has not been tested previously. We hypothesized that the delivery of myeloablative dose of busulfan over a 3-week period may reduce toxicity and non-relapse mortality (NRM), without affecting relapse, and tested this in a prospective phase II study. Methods: Patients between 18 and 70 years of age with hematological malignancies and adequate organ function, with 8/8-HLA matched related or unrelated donor were eligible. They received a fixed dose of busulfan 80mg/m2 as outpatient on days -20 and -13. Then, fludarabine 40mg/m2 was given on days -6 to -2 followed by busulfan dosed to achieve target area under the curve (AUC) of 20,000 mol/min for the whole course based on pharmacokinetic studies. GVHD prophylaxis was cyclophosphamide (PTCy) 50mg/kg on days 3 and 4 and tacrolimus. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was added to later unrelated donor recipients. All patients received standard supportive care. The primary endpoint was day 100 NRM. Results: We enrolled 52 patients with a median age of 62 (range, 39-69) years. Almost half (n=25, 48%) had AML or MDS and the other half (n=26, 50%) had had CML or MPD; 1 (2%) had multiple myeloma. Low, intermediate, high and very-high disease risk index (DRI) was present in 3 (6%), 34 (65%), 14 (27%) and 1 (2%). HCT-comorbidity index was >3 in 23 (44%) and 1-2 (n=23, 44%). A majority (n=32, 62%) had an unrelated donor. With a median follow up of 14 months (range, 3-23), NRM at day 100 was 1.9% (n=1) and 8% (95% CI, 0-15) at 1 year. Overall survival, progression-free survival and relapse at 1-year were 83% (95% CI, 73-95%), 78% (95% CI, 67-91%), and 14% (95% CI, 4-24%), respectively [Table]. There were no graft failures. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 17 days (range, 13-33) and that of platelets (> 20K/\u00b5L, n=45) was 24 days (range, 9-266). Day 100 grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD rates were 37% (95% CI, 23-50%) and 6% (95% CI, 0-12%), respectively; 1-year chronic GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD rates were 9% (95% CI, 0-17%) and 7% (95% CI, 0-14%), respectively. Overall survival at 1-year differed significantly among patients with low/intermediate DRI (94%; 87-100%) and those with high/very high DRI (53%; 31-91%), P=0.001. Conclusion: Myeloablative fractionated busulfan regimen with PTCy GVHD prophylaxis is feasible in older patients, has low incidence of severe acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, and NRM and results in promising overall survival.
