    "abstract_text": "Abstract 455 Functional B cell and plasma cell immune responses are dependent upon an exquisitely controlled process integrating signals from activating and inhibitory receptors present on the surface of these cells. These activating and inhibitory signaling pathways regulate both the quality and quantity of immunoglobulin (Ig) production. These signaling motifs, termed immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) and ITIM provide the basis for two opposed signaling modules that duel for control of plasma cellular activation within the immune system. The inhibitory Fc receptor Fc\u03b3RIIb is expressed on plasma cells and controls their persistence in the bone marrow and their ability to produce most serum Ig. Activation of Fc\u03b3RIIb leads to the phosphorylation of ITIM and recruitment of SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) SHP-2 and the SH2-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP) in plasma cells. Fc\u03b3RIIb-mediated SHIP phosphorylation results in enhanced degradation of PtdIns (3,4,5)P, which is required for B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)-induced recruitment and activation of downstream ITAM signaling molecules. The inhibitory IgG Fc receptor Fc\u03b3RIIB was the first discovered and remains the best studied example of an ITIM-containing receptor. In this study, we first investigated the IgG-binding ability of 18 MM patients and 10 normal donors to Fc\u03b3RIIb using flow cytometric analysis. Each serum sample was incubated with MHC1 cells that only express Fc\u03b3RIIb but do not express Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RIIa. After washing three times with 1 \u00d7 PBS, anti-human IgG antibody conjugated with FITC was added to the cells for another 30 minutes. The results showed MM patients' serum IgG have much lower Fc\u03b3RIIb-binding ability than normal human IgG (P<0.05). Immunohistochemical staining also demonstrated MM patients' sera showed obviously less binding to the Fc\u03b3RIIb on MHC1 cells compared to serum samples from normal human donors. We further analyzed the Fc\u03b3RIIb-SHIP signaling pathway in normal B-cells following exposure to MM and normal human sera. Fresh human B-cells were isolated using anti-CD20 antibodies with magnetic bead selection and the cells were washed in an acidic solution (pH 4) for 1 minute to remove any bound antigen from the cell surface. Raji B-cells were also acid-treated. First, these cells were exposed to MM patients' or normal human sera for 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes to determine the maximum time point of SHIP phosphorylation. Using a standard Western blot protocol, phosphorylated SHIP and total SHIP protein expression were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. The maximum time point of SHIP phosphorylation was 15 minutes. The results showed that both normal human B-cells and Raji B-cells showed markedly lower SHIP phosphorylation/total SHIP following exposure to MM patient serum compared to normal human serum which is consistent with the lack of binding of human Ig to Fc\u03b3RIIb. Our findings suggest that the monoclonal protein produced by MM patients has very low Fc\u03b3RIIb-binding ability and is incapable of signaling through inhibitory ITIM pathway. Most importantly, Fc\u03b3RIIb is expressed on plasma cells and controls their persistence in the bone marrow in addition to Ig production. Cross-linking of Fc\u03b3RIIb induces apoptosis of plasma cells (Xiang Z et al Nat Immunol 8: 419-29, 2007). Thus, it is possible that this effect prevents the induction of apoptosis in MM cells. Previous studies have reported that normal Ig is capable of inducing B-cell apoptosis. Thus, it is possible that exposure of MM cells to normal immunoglobulin may be capable of inducing apoptosis of these cells and reducing their production of M-protein. We are currently evaluating the ITIM signal transduction pathway, M-protein production and apoptosis in MM and normal B-cells following exposure to normal and MM M-protein IgG.
