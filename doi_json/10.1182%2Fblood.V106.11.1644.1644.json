    "abstract_text": "We have previously demonstrated that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) associates constitutively with the integrin \u03b1 IIb subunit and regulates myosin light chain phosphorylation. In this study, we considered whether other member of the serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) phosphatase family namely, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) associates with the integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 . Co-immunoprecipitation assays using lysates from resting human platelets revealed the presence of a catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) in the \u03b1 IIb immunoprecipitates, and in a reciprocal experiment, \u03b1 IIb was detected in the PP2Ac immunoprecipitates. In contrast, another platelet abundant Ser/Thr phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) was not detected in the \u03b1 IIb immunoprecipitates. Furthermore, the association of PP2Ac with integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 was also observed in 293 cells overexpressing \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 . These results indicate a constitutive and specific interaction of PP2Ac with the integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 . Polystyrene beads coated with purified PP2Ac but not BSA supported the binding of purified integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 in a dose dependent manner, suggesting that the interaction of PP2Ac with \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 was direct. Furthermore, purified PP2Ac as well as PP2Ac in lysates obtained from the resting platelets bound specifically to a biotinylated \u03b1 IIb cytoplasmic peptide encompassing residues 985\u2013995 but not to a scrambled peptide, suggesting that the integrin \u03b1 IIb is sufficient to mediate the interaction of PP2Ac in vitro. The association of PP2Ac with the platelet integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 was not altered during platelet adhesion to fibrinogen (\u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 outside-in signaling) or during thrombin or ADP stimulation (inside-out signaling to \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 ). In contrast, we have previously shown that integrin-bound PP1 dissociated from the \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 complex upon platelet adhesion and thrombin-induced platelet activation. The association of PP2Ac with the integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 correlates well with the dephosphorylation of a PP2A substrate, extracellular-signal regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) during thrombin-induced platelet aggregation that we and others have previously demonstrated. More importantly, ERK2 dephosphorylation was not observed in platelets from Glanzmann thrombasthenic patients or in normal platelets pretreated with RGDS or integrilin, suggesting a critical role for integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 in the dephosphorylation of ERK2. To ascertain a physiological relevance for the PP2A-\u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 association, we used short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to knock down the expression of PP2Ac in the 293/\u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 cells. Knock down was maximal (~55\u201370%) and specific to PP2Ac because PP1 and actin protein levels were not different between the control and PP2Ac siRNA treated cells. Consistent with the reduction in the PP2Ac protein level in the PP2Ac knock down cells there was ~70% reduction in the PP2Ac phosphatase activity, and a concomitant increased basal ERK2 phosphorylation. PP2Ac knock down significantly (P\u22640.006) increased the adhesion of 293/\u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 cells to fibrinogen. The adhesion was \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 specific because it could be abolished with an \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 function blocking antibody (10E5). These findings supports a mechanism whereby the integrin associated Ser/Thr phosphatases might regulate \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 adhesive functions via dephosphorylation of key cytoskeletal proteins.",
