    "abstract_text": "Background Recently, HIV-1 infection was shown to be efficiently inhibited in macrophages and T-cells treated with hemin that was added extracellularly 1,2 . Hemin administration to humanized transgenic mice significantly reduced HIV-1 viral load 1 . Suppression of HIV-1 by hemin was mediated through the induction of (HO-1) 1 , via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway 2 . The inhibitory effect of hemin could be reversed by protoporphyrin, an HO-1 inhibitor 2 . Induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by hemin was shown to inhibit HIV-1. We recently analyzed the role of HO-1 in protecting LPS-treated human macrophages against HIV-1 infection 3 . LPS-treated macrophages were negative for mature virions, expressed HO-1 and produced MIP1\u03b1, MIP1\u03b2 and LD78\u03b2 chemokines which led to a decreased CCR5 expression. Treatment with HO-1 inhibitor SnPP IX (tin protoporphyrin IX) increased HIV-1 replication and decreased secretion of MIP1\u03b1, MIP1\u03b2, and LD78\u03b2 chemokines. HO-1 also affects several proteins involved in cell cycle progression, and cell cycle is critical for HIV-1 progression. Hypoxia leads to induction and stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 and is inhibitory to HIV-1 replication. NF-kB is important for basal and Tat-activated HIV-1 transcription. Here we analyzed factors involved in HIV-1 transcription affected by HO-1 expression. Results HIV-1 replication was reduced in THP1 cells treated with hemin. Subsequent treatment with hepcidin restored HIV-1 replication, suggesting that ferroportin plays a key role in the HIV-1 inhibition. Stable ferroportin knock down in THP1 cells led to the inability of hemin to inhibit HIV-1, again suggesting that ferroportin plays a key role in this process. In hemin-treated THP-1 cells, expression of p21, HIF-1\u03b1 and IKB\u03b1 mRNA was induced. The expression of IKB\u03b1, an inhibitor of NF-kB, reduced the level of p65 subunit of NF-kB. We obtained similar results in THP-1 cell treated with iron chelators, which also induced the expression of IKB\u03b1, HIF-1 and p21. THP-1 cells treated with hemin or iron chelators were arrested in G1 phase of cell cycle. Stable HIF-1a knockdown in promonocytic THP-1 cells increased HIV replication suggesting that HIF-1 might be a restriction factor for HIV-1. In contrast to iron chelators that inhibited enzymatic activity of CDK2 without affecting its protein level, hemin treatment reduced CDK2 expression at mRNA and protein levels. Conclusions Induction of HIF-1 regulatory pathway and iron export by ferroportin might protect hemin-treated THP-1 cells from HIV-1 infection. Additional molecular mechanisms of heme-mediated HIV-1 inhibition might also include NF-kB inhibition by IKB\u03b1 and CDK2 inhibition leading to the inhibition of HIV-1 transcription. Our results point to novel therapeutics, such as the use of hemin and iron chelators, both of which are FDA approved for treatment for acute porphyries and iron overload.
