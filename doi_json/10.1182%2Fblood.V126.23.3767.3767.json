    "abstract_text": "T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is a rare form of leukaemia that accounts for approximately 15% of paediatric ALL cases. Unfortunately, approximately 20% of patients do not achieve long term remission as a result of failure of therapy to eradicate the disease. T-ALL is a highly heterogeneous disease that displays a spectrum of immunophenotypes, chromosomal aberrations and gene expression profiles. This heterogeneity has prompted research into more targeted therapies, with the aim of overcoming drug resistance often found with standard chemotherapeutic regimens. Here, we build upon use of the drug Parthenolide (PTL), which has shown promise in treatment of T-ALL and other leukaemias such as BCP-ALL and AML, in combination with ABT-263, a BCL-2 family antagonising agent. Bone marrow samples from 10 T-ALL cases, taken at diagnosis, were treated with PTL in vitro for 24 hours then viability was assessed using the annexin V / PI flow cytometric assay. Variable cytotoxic effects were observed in samples treated with PTL (1-10\u00b5M), with half maximal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 2.6-10 \u00b5M. At the highest dose tested, the proportion of surviving cells ranged from 5.79-56% (median 35.33%). BM from 5 of these samples was used for whole genome microarray (WGA) analysis. We compared gene expression in bulk ALL and in specific subpopulations, known to have leukaemia initiating capacity in vivo; CD34 + /CD7 + , CD34 + /CD7 - , CD34 - /CD7 + and CD34 - /CD7 - cells. WGA data demonstrated that CD34 + /CD7 - was the only subpopulation to express significantly lower levels (5.38 fold) of the pro-apoptotic gene Bcl-2L11 (BIM) compared to the unsorted bulk T-ALL cells, p=0.006. Interestingly, we have previously shown that CD34 + /CD7 - cells from a few patients were resistant to PTL treatment in vivo compared to unsorted cells. To validate these results, mRNA and relative protein quantification was performed by qPCR and western blotting in bulk material from 8 of the 10 samples, 3 of which had been analysed by microarray for BIM expression. We found that the gene and protein expression levels of BIM were negatively correlated with PTL resistance in vitro, p\u22640.0001 and p=0.049 respectively. This suggests that reduced BIM expression is related to PTL resistance. We next evaluated the effects of combining PTL and ABT-263 on T-ALL cells in vitro. ABT-263 is a BH3 protein mimetic, like BIM it promotes apoptosis by blocking the inhibitory effects that BCL-2 anti-apoptotic proteins have on pro-apoptotic proteins. The effects of combining the drugs were assessed in 7 of the original 10 samples. Unsorted ALL cells were incubated with PTL and ABT-263 for 24 hours, before viability was analysed by flow cytometry and drug synergy was calculated via the Chou Talalay method. This drug combination showed enhanced cytotoxicity to T-ALL cells compared to PTL (p=0.0282) or ABT-263 (p=0.0358) alone. Moreover, the highest combined dose tested (2.5\u00b5M PTL with 0.25\u00b5M ABT-263) killed 86.1\u00b19% cells cf 71.8\u00b118% with ABT-263 alone and only 21.7\u00b111% with PTL alone. The combination also showed synergism with a combination index value below 1 in all doses tested. Previous findings in our laboratory have shown that in vivo PTL treatment eliminated childhood leukaemia in NOD/LtSz-scid IL-2R\u03b3 c null (NSG) mice, in most cases tested. It may be possible to further enhance this toxicity using ABT-263 alone or in combination with PTL. NSG mice were inoculated with unsorted T-ALL cells and leukaemia was allowed to establish until levels in peripheral blood (PB) exceeded 0.1%. NSG mice were subsequently treated orally for 21 days with 100mg/kg of ABT-263 or placebo and leukaemia burden was monitored weekly in PB aspirates. Twenty-eight days following commencement of treatment, leukaemia burden in the placebo treated group was 80.73\u00b12.94% and the animals were electively culled. In contrast, disease burden was significantly lower in the treated animals at this stage (35.2\u00b12.1%, p=0.004). ABT-263 treatment has significantly improved survival of all xenografts to date, (P<0.014). In summary, we have shown that PTL resistance is related to the expression of BIM. By combining PTL with ABT-263, which mimics the pro-apoptotic action of BIM, the drugs work synergistically to enhance T-ALL cytotoxicity in vitro. Ongoing in vivo studies will assess the full potential of this combination therapy for paediatric T-ALL. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
