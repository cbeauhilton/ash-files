    "abstract_text": "Genetic hemochromatosis (HH) is a common inherited disorder in populations of European origin in which different types of genetic hemochromatosis (type 1\u20134) have been characterized. Most hemochromatosis-type 1 patients are homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for two HFE mutations C282Y and H63D. Studies of several non- HFE iron overload families led to identification of mutations in hemojuvelin and hepcidin (juvenile form-HFE2A and B), transferrin receptor 2 (HFE3) and ferroportin (HFE4) as a cause of different forms of hemochromatosis. In the Far East, inherited hemochromatosis has rarely been reported and may have been misdiagnosed due to the high prevalence of secondary iron loading from hemoglobin disorders. This report describes, for the first time, non- HFE iron overload in patients from Southeast Asia. The affected Thai family presented with a distinctive clinical phenotype including macrocytosis and elevated transferrin saturation (>95%), increased non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) as well as raised serum ferritin and marked hepatic hemochromatosis. Our patients tolerated therapeutic phlebotomy well. DNAs from peripheral blood leukocytes were firstly analyzed for three common HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D and IVS5+1 G\u2192A). Subsequently, we screened all coding sequences, promoters and exon/intron boundaries of the HFE , HAMP, TfR2, HJV and SLC40A1 genes using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). The entire coding region and splice sites of these genes were amplified and directly sequenced. We identified a novel mutation (C326Y) in ferroportin ( SLC40A1 , IREG-1, MTP-1 ), a membrane iron transport protein due to a G\u2192A substitution at nucleotide 1281 in exon 7. This mutation was confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis using Sfa NI. Six hundred Thai and two hundred Vietnamese chromosomes were analyzed for the C326Y mutation by RFLP analysis and it was not detected in any of the healthy controls studied. This result suggested that the G\u2192A substitution is not a common polymorphism and is likely to be the causative mutation for the phenotype in this family. Previous reported mutations of ferroportin, including A77D and V162del, which lead to type IV hemochromatosis, were characterized by increased serum ferritin despite normal transferrin saturation, in contrast to our patients\u2019 phenotype. These autosomal dominant mutants are postulated to lead to disease due to loss of iron exporting function. Preliminary in vivo assay using transient transfection of wild-type and ferroportin mutants in HeLa or 293T cells revealed, as expected, a loss of function and diminished surface membrane localisation in A77D and V162del mutants. Surprisingly, the C326Y mutant was indistinguishable from wt ferroportin in both iron status of the cell and protein localization suggesting different pathophysiology leading to iron overload in our patients.",
