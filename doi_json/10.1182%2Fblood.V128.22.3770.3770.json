    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND . Cell derived microparticles (MP), are small vesicle (<1um) released in cell activation or apoptosis. Depending on stimulus, MPs can be heterogeneous in phenotype and functional activities such as hemostatic vs thrombogenic vs proinflammatory. In this study, we compared RMP produced in three ways: (1) induced by calcium ionophore (RMP-CaI), (2) released from packed cells (PC) during storage up to 42 days (RMP-Stor) and (3) by high-pressure extrusion of washed RBC (RMP-HPE). The aim of the study was to elucidate how the functional property of these species vary with mode of production. METHODS . For RMP-Stor, samples were taken at intervals up to 42 days of PC stored at 4 o C, then centrifuged to recover the RMP released. For RMP-CaI, supernatants of fresh RBC exposed to Ca 2+ /ionophore (A23187) for 30 min were centrifuged. For RMP-HPE, washed RBC were subjected to high-pressure extrusion, and the resulting RMP were collected by centrifugation and washed. Flow cytometric counts were by CD235a (glycophorin A) and annexinV (AnV) binding. Thromboelastography (TEG) compared equal counts of each sample type, based on CD235a, diluted as needed with particle-free pooled plasma (PFP). RESULTS : (1) Yield per mL of initial packed RBC: The highest yield of RMP was seen in RMP-HPE, as expected since \u2248100% of RBC convert to RMP-HPE. This was followed by RMP-CaI, which was about 3x more than RMP-Stor at 42 days. The RMP-Stor increased linearly from day 21 to 42. (2) AnV binding was expressed as ratio AnV+/CD235+, and is a marker of procoagulant phospholipid. This ratio was least in RMP-HPE (0.38) and more than doubled in both RMP-Stor (0.92) and RMP-CaI (1.0). (3) Size of RMP by forward scatter (FS) increased steadily with time in RMP-Stor, from day 21 (0.56 um) to day 42 (0.79 um). These values are somewhat larger than RMP-CaI (0.47 um) or RMP-HPE (0.52 um). The side-scatter signal correlated with the FS values. (4) Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was by far highest in RMP-Stor (56 nM/min, per 10 6 particles) vs . 4.5 for RMP-CaI, and 1.5 for RMP-HPE. (5) Procoagulant activity: In TEG, the increase in MA (maximum amplitude) by addition of RMP-Stor was 64 mm, but was not increased by RMP-HPE or RMP-CaI. The R-time (lag) showed greatest shortening with RMP-Stor (10.2 min), followed by RMP-CaI (6.7 min), and RMP-HPE (3.6 min) (6) Anti-fibrinolytic activity: In presence of 0.4 ug/mL of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), for the purpose of making fibrinolytic activity more detectable in a short time, all 3 species of RMP effectively inhibit t-PA-mediated fibrinolysis measured by TEG parameters, including MA, Ly30, and TTG (total thrombus formation). The RMP-HPE was most effective followed by RMP-Stor, and RMP-CaI. CONCLUSION / DISCUSSION . Results demonstrate clear and distinctive differences in functional and phenotypic properties of the 3 species compared. RMP-Stor and RMP-CaI are lager in size, higher in PS and AChE expression, and higher in procoagulant activity, compared to RMP-HPE. On the other hand, RMP-HPE are higher in number generated per mL packed RBC and exhibit stronger inhibition of tPA-mediated fibrinolysis. It is well known that RMP generated by storage and calcium ionophore are enriched in lipid rafts. In contrast, the RMP-HPE are not enriched in lipid rafts, as reflected in low AChE. We conjecture that the contents of lipid raft on RMP may play an important role in determining the functional properties of RMP. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
