    "abstract_text": "PURPOSE Pain for sickle cell patients occurs on a daily basis, but this becomes magnified during a sickle cell crisis (SCC). The mainstay of treatment during hospitalization is intravenous fluids and opiates however this can be a nidus for an opiate addiction long term, especially in the ongoing opiate epidemic. Marijuana has been used in a variety of chronic pain disorders including those from cancer. It is known that within the sickle cell population, smoking tobacco increases the risk of acute chest syndrome. Marijuana use or its derivatives used to treat pain has not been studied on a large scale within the sickle cell population. We propose the question of whether marijuana use affects SCC admissions as well as acute chest syndrome (ACS). METHODS The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) dataset was queried from 2005 to 2014 to identify the primary diagnosis of SCC with the International Classification of Disease (ICD) Code 282.42, 282.62, 282.64 and 282.69, as has been done in the literature. We then identified those with marijuana use, excluding those used in the past and not currently with the ICD code 304.30, 304.31 and 304.32. Additionally we identified those with ACS with the ICD code of 517.3. We then used multivariate analysis along with Chi-square for non-continuous variables using the statistical software SAS. RESULTS Between the years of 2005 and the 2014, there were a total of 798,313 hospitalizations for sickle cell crisis in the United States. Around 0.08 % of these patients had marijuana use. When stratified by race marijuana use was predominantly documented among African Americans (95.2%) followed by Hispanics (3.8%). Length of stay was statistically the same among marijuana users at 4.65 vs 5.28 days without use (p = 0.11) when compared to non-users. Total charges at the end of hospitalization were also the same at $23134.2 vs $24662.7 (p=0.60) with marijuana users and non-users respectively. Marijuana patients did that lower proportions of ACS at 5.46% vs 8.48% without (p= 0.004) and a relative risk of 0.64. Proportion of death was the same with marijuana users of 0% and non-users 0.28% (p=0.16). The age at admission was higher at 30.77 when compared to 27.25 among non-users (p=0.0009). CONCLUSIONS: Marijuana use was associated with lower instances of ACS with a relative risk of 0.64. Additionally patients presented on average 3 years later than non-users. The fact that mortality, length of stay and total charges were the same amongst the two groups may indicate that during a crisis, the disease process is the same, however outside of having a crisis, marijuana use may help with pain control given later presentation. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Further research should be done to look at marijuana use as an alternative to pain control for sickle cell patients in the community setting.
