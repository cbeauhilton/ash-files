    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4431 The European Treatment Outcome Study (EUTOS) is register based international investigation started in June 2007. [1] The aim is to study the epidemiology of CML and to gain insight into the \u2018real world\u2019 treatment of patients with CML. Population base section (EUTOS-PBS) is the prospective study directed mostly to epidemiology aims. Russian part of the EUTOS-PBS registry collect data of newly diagnosed patients lived in 7 large regions of about 10 millions of population totally. EUTOS-PBS inclusion criteria are following: newly diagnosed CML (Ph +/BCR-ABL) started form 1st October 2009, age: older than 18. Russian CML group includes additional protocol for collection data for patients with clinical symptoms of CML. These patients are included into the roster table and after laboratory confirmation are enrolled into the main phase of the study. Thus, 174 patients were included in pre-phase, 142 (82%) had the diagnosis of CML which was confirmed by cytogenetic/molecular-genetic tests (Ph +/BCR-ABL +), 32 (18%) was not confirmed as CML. Among them 87% (n = 20) - have other Ph\u2013negative chronic myeloproliferative diseases, and also acute leukemia (n = 1), cancer (n = 1), chronic inflammatory processes (n = 1). 142 patients with CML are 73 men, 69 women have the age from 18 to 82 (Me 49) years. 136 (96%) of patients are in the chronic phase, 6 (4%) -in the phase of acceleration, nobody in a blast n\u0303risis. The standard frequency analysis with adjustment to the standard population of WHO was carried out to estimate distribution. The results was presented in the table 1. As shown registered morbidity in 6 regions is not varied so much: source incidence is 0,58 (0,44\u20130,69); standardized on WHO incidence is: 0,7 (0,57 \u2013 0,85); per 100 thousands per year. Estimated registered morbidity of CML in Russian regions are in 1.5\u20132 times less, than published morbidity in western countries. The analysis of the incidence in age stratums (table 2) shows that there is no much growth of age morbidity as expected. It obviously points to low detectability of new CML incidents in senior age categories (are more senior 60 years). This fact is probably the main reason of low total registered morbidity. Tabl.1. Incidence rate of new CML cases in 6 regions of Russia Region population (mln.) N CML for 100000. in year Standard of WHO Mordovia Republic 0.87 14 0.69 0.85 Kirov region 1.46 18 0.53 0.6 Perm territory 2.77 45 0.68 0.8 Bryansk region 1.35 17 0.53 0.65 Irkutsk region 2.55 36 0.56 0.68 Zabaikal's territory 1.36 12 0.44 0.57 Total 10.13 142 0.58 0.7 Table 2.CML incidence in age groups Age groups Male Female Maleandfemale 18\u201329 0.65 0.57 0.61 30\u201339 0.86 0.39 0.62 40\u201349 0.50 0.57 0.54 Conclusion: The CML incidence in Russia regions is underestimated. The main reason is an insufficient CML diagnostic screening in the senior age groups of population.
