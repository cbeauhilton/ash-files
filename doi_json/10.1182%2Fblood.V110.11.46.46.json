    "abstract_text": "The use of GSCF-mobilised Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSC) for unrelated donor (UD) transplantation has increased dramatically since 2000. The association of PBSC with more rapid engraftment and with an increase in chronic Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD), compared to bone marrow (BM) has been reported in a number of studies. More recently the use of PBSC has been associated with an increase in transplant related mortality (TRM) and decrease in survival (OS) in T-cell replete transplants. We sought to analyse the impact of PBSC compared to BM in a cohort of UD transplant recipients, where T-cell depleting agents (in-vivo campath in >90%) were included in the transplant conditioning. The study included 145 patients transplanted between January 2000 and March 2006: CML- 35 in 1CP; acute leukaemia (AML in 61, ALL in 49)-110 in CR1 or 2. All had myeloablative conditioning regimens and received grafts with 9\u201310/10 matched HLA alleles. 86 patients received BM and 59 PBSC. There were no associations between the stem cell source and any transplant variable (including disease and stage). There was a trend to an increased use of PBSC in patients with a single antigen mismatch (p=0.052). All evaluable patients achieved neutrophil engraftment, with a significantly faster time to engraft in recipients of PBSC compared to BM (16 vs 20 days; p=0.0003). The incidence of acute GvHD was 46% (grade I in 50%, II in 41%, III in 8%, IV in 2%). This was significantly higher in recipients of PBSC (60%) compared to BM (36%; p=0.006), however there was no increase in either II/IV (p=0.69) or III/IV (p=0.18) disease in PBSC recipients. In univariate analysis, the presence of a single HLA mismatch (p=0.026) was the only other variable to be associated with an increase in acute GvHD. In a logistic regression model including both these variables, the use of PBSC remained significantly associated with an increase in aGvHD (OR=2.3; 95% CI 1.1,4.7;p=0.020). The TRM was 14%, 27% and 39% at 100 days, 1 and 5 years respectively. At none of these time points was the stem cell source associated with a significant difference in TRM. The 5-year incidence of chronic GvHD was 58% (BM 55%, PBSC 60%; NS), extensive disease in one third, and of relapse was 61% (BM 60%, PBSC 62%; NS). The 5-years OS was 41% with a median follow-up of 3.4 years (0.5\u20137.1). This was 44% using PBSC and 40% using BM (NS). In conclusion, although we observed an increase in acute GVHD with PBSC this was only of grade 1 disease. We found no association between the use of PBSC and an increased risk of chronic GVHD or of a worse transplant outcome, when compared to BM, in recipients of T-cell depleted myeloablative transplants for leukaemia.",
