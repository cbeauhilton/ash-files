    "abstract_text": "Background Multiple groups of pts, including elderly/frail pts and those with comorbidities, are typically under-represented in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A recent study found an average of 16 eligibility criteria per cancer trial, 60% of which were related to comorbidity or performance status (PS; Unger, JNCI 2014). Phase 3 RCTs in MM have similar extensive eligibility criteria, resulting in populations that are not reflective of RW MM pts. Data from CONNECT-MM (Shah, CLML, 2017) and CoMMpass (Fiala, IMW 2017) suggest that 22-40% of RW pts are ineligible for MM RCTs, and an analysis of US RW relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM) pts showed that only 25-47% of pts would have been eligible for the phase 3 ASPIRE, TOURMALINE-MM1, ELOQUENT-2, and POLLUX studies, based on their differing eligibility criteria (Chari, EHA 2018). Further, data from CONNECT MM show that clinical trial ineligibility is associated with poorer long-term outcome (Shah, CLML, 2017). Thus, it is important to characterize RW MM pts and understand the discrepancies vs RCT populations. INSIGHT MM (NCT02761187) is the largest prospective, observational study in MM to date, following ~4,200 pts from 15 countries. Here we analyze RCT eligibility in INSIGHT MM pts, with a focus on the treatment of frail MM pts in the real world. Methods INSIGHT MM is following newly diagnosed (\u22643 mos since treatment initiation) MM (NDMM) and RRMM (\u22643 prior lines) pts. Demographics and disease characteristics, including medical history, comorbidities, PS, and frailty status (per IMWG Frailty Index criteria, Palumbo, JCO 2015), are collected using electronic case report forms at study baseline visit. For this analysis, pt data were reviewed vs 20 standard RCT eligibility criteria, using a conservative approach of classifying 'not available' data as 'eligible'; laboratory/PS and medical history exclusion criteria are summarized in the Table. Presence of hypertension was reviewed but omitted, as INSIGHT MM only collected data on 'hypertension requiring treatment' vs the standard RCT exclusion criterion of 'uncontrolled hypertension'. Results Data from 3,201 pts (1,761 NDMM, 1,440 RRMM) were analyzed. The proportions of pts who would be ineligible for RCTs based on each individual parameter, and the overall rate of ineligible pts, are shown in the Table. Overall, 39.2% of pts would have been ineligible for RCTs based on not meeting at least one of the 20 standard eligibility criteria included in this analysis, including 38.8% of NDMM and 39.7% of RRMM pts. The most common criteria excluding pts overall were another prior malignancy (7.5%), CrCl \u226430 mL/min (6.4%), cardiac arrhythmias (5.4%), platelets \u226475,000/mm 3 (5.1%), and hemoglobin <8.0 g/dL (4.8%). Common criteria were similar in NDMM and RRMM pts, except for higher rates of CrCl \u226430 mL/min (7.3%) and hemoglobin <8.0 g/dL (5.9%) in NDMM pts, and higher rates of platelets \u226475,000/mm 3 (7.4%) in RRMM pts. Frail pts are particularly likely to be ineligible for RCTs based on these standard criteria. Per study team evaluation applying the IMWG Frailty Index parameters, 320/1,685 evaluable pts (19%) were determined to be frail in INSIGHT MM. Of these 320 frail pts, applying the 20 standard eligibility criteria used in this analysis, 74.7% would have been ineligible for RCTs. Of 126 evaluable frail 1 st line pts, 30 (24%) and 83 (66%) received doublet and triplet therapy, respectively, with median duration of treatment (DoT; Kaplan-Meier analysis) of 5.4 and 6.2 mos. Of 48 evaluable 2 nd to 4 th line pts, 26 (54%) and 21 (44%) received doublet and triplet therapy, respectively, with median DoT of 4.4 and 5.3 mos. Additional analyses of treatments received, reasons for treatment discontinuation, and DoT by frailty status and RCT eligibility will be presented. Conclusions A high proportion of INSIGHT MM pts (39.2%) were RCT-ineligible, consistent with or higher than previous reports. Common reasons for ineligibility included prior history of malignancy, low CrCl, and cardiac arrhythmias; more RRMM vs NDMM pts were excluded due to low platelet count. Analysis of frail pts suggests that these pts are particularly under-represented in RCTs using standard eligibility criteria. These findings emphasize the discrepancy between RW and RCT pt populations and the importance of RW data for evaluating effectiveness of treatment options. Initiatives are also ongoing to broaden oncology clinical trial eligibility criteria.
