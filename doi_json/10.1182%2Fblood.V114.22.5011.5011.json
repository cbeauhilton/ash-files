    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5011 Introduction Lymphomatous and leukemic meningitis (LM), although a well known and relatively frequent complication of aggressive lymphoma and leukemia, are still difficult to detect. With cytomorphology, neoplastic lyphocytes are difficult to distinguish from inflammatory lymphocytes. We evaluated here if specific morphological criteria can improve this differentiation. Moreover, we assessed the sensitivity of MRI and protein analysis for the detection of LM in comparison with CSF-cytology. Patients and Methods To establish cytomorphological criteria, 42 cytospin preparations of CSF from patients with confirmed CSF involvement by aggressive lymphoma or acute leukemia were compared with 26 samples of inflammatory diseases. CSF cytology was analyzed morphologically for pre-selected parameters of cell, cytoplasm and nucleic appearance and the presence of mitoses or apoptoses. For the comparison of cytology and MRI, 38 patients with leukemic or lymphomatous meningitis were evaluated retrospectively for MRI-signs of neoplastic meningitis and for CSF-protein abnormalities (total protein, oligoclonal bands, lactate, ferritine). Results as expected, none of the cytomorphological parameters sharply discerns neoplastic and inflammatory transformation. However, neoplastic cells were significantly larger than inflammatory lymphocytes with a mean of 3.0 as opposed to 1.8 times the size of normal small lymphocytes (p=0.0001). Moreover, irregular shape, pointed borders of the cytoplasm, and deep notches in the nucleus were significantly more often found with neoplastic than with inflammatory lymphocytes. The total cell count was elevated in 68% of cases of lymphomatous meningitis. While cytomorphology could achieve approx. 90% sensitivity for the detection of LM, spinal and/or cranial MRI only detected 71% of cases with normal and 52% with elevated cell counts. Total protein was elevated in 77% of cases, lactate in 55% and ferritine in 48%. Oligoclonal IgG was found in 11% isolated in the CSF and in 18% in CSF and serum identically. Only 3/38 patients (8%) had completely normal CSF cell count and proteins. Conclusions CSF cytology is more sensitive than MRI for the detection of LM, but application of both methods clearly enhances the sensitivity by approx. 10%. No single cytomorphological parameter is sufficient to detect neoplastic lymphocytes. Considering a combination of cell size and irregular shape of cell and nucleus may improve the diagnostic accuracy of CSF dissemination by aggressive hematological malignancies.
