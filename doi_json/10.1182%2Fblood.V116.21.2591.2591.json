    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2591 Adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) reside in dedicated niches in the bone marrow (BM). Within this specialized microenvironment, the various interactions of HSC with adhesion molecules on neighbouring cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) components are critical for the maintenance of the HSC population and the concomitant development of the distinct blood cell lineages. Comparative gene-expression profiling of purified HSC identified ECM proteins that are differentially expressed in homeostatic and regenerative conditions. The ECM protein \u03b2ig-h3 was one of the proteins upregulated in regenerative conditions. Therefore, we characterized the role of \u03b2ig-h3 in the regulation of HSC self-renewal and differentiation. A comparison between human CD34 + hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) isolated from BM, mobilized peripheral blood (MPB) and umbilical cord blood (UCB), revealed the highest \u03b2ig-h3 expression in BM-HSPC (3.9-fold increased compared to MPB, 1.7-fold increased compared to CB), which may implie a role for \u03b2ig-h3 in retaining HSC in the BM. To examine the functional relevance of \u03b2ig-h3 in HSC, we first increased \u03b2ig-h3 expression by transducing human HSPC with a lentiviral \u03b2ig-h3-SIN-GFP expression vector or a control SIN-GFP vector. Over-expression of \u03b2ig-h3 (80-fold) in HSPC decreased colony-forming-unit-granulocyte-monocyte (CFU-GM) formation from 130 (SEM=47) to 73 (SEM=19, n=3) CFU-GM per 500 plated CD34 + cells, while megakaryopoiesis was accelerated and the number of mature megakaryocytic cells increased from 16% (SEM=6%) to 30% (SEM=7%, n=4) at day 14 of culture. Ectopic expression of \u03b2ig-h3 did not affect differentiation along the erythroid or granulopoietic lineage. The development of megakaryocytes at the cost of pluripotent CFU-GM suggests that \u03b2ig-h3 drives differentiation. In addition, \u03b2ig-h3 expression in HSPC was reduced by two different short-hairpin-RNAs (shRNA) expressed from lentiviral vectors, which resulted in decreased proliferation (from 19.6- to 5.8-fold per input cell at day 13) and increased apoptosis (from 13.5% to 25.3% at day 13) in liquid HSPC cultures, as analyzed by Annexin V staining. Similarly, knock-down of \u03b2ig-h3 in various cell lines also resulted in a decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Knock-down of \u03b2ig-h3 in primary HSPC dramatically reduced CFU-GM from 73 (SEM=8.7) to 31 (SEM=14.4, n=6) CFU-GM per 500 CD34 + cells plated, and reduced colony-forming-unit-erythrocyte (CFU-E) formation from 30 (SEM=6.5) to 9 (SEM=1.6, n=4) CFU-E per 500 CD34 + cells plated. This can be explained by increased apoptosis of \u03b2ig-h3 knock-down cells. Notably, co-culture of \u03b2ig-h3 knock-down HSPC with stromal feeder cells, known to express high levels of \u03b2ig-h3, showed no difference compared to control HSPC in cobblestone area formation within two weeks, indicating that stromal cells can counteract apoptosis in \u03b2ig-h3 knock-down cells. Remarkably, long-term-culture CFU-GM (LTC-CFU) formation of HSPC that were co-cultured with stromal cells during two weeks, was even significantly increased (1.9-fold, n=2) in \u03b2ig-h3 knock-down cells, indicating that decreased endogenous levels of \u03b2ig-h3 stimulates the maintenance or expansion of HSPC on stroma. In conclusion, ectopic expression of \u03b2ig-h3 decreased CFU-GM in HSPC and accelerated differentiation towards megakaryocytes, suggesting that \u03b2ig-h3 might drive lineage commitment of HSC. Conversely, knock-down of \u03b2ig-h3 in HSPC stimulated LTC-CFU formation, indicating that decreased \u03b2ig-h3 levels in HSPC maintain their undifferentiated state. In absence of stroma, however, knock-down of \u03b2ig-h3 induces apoptosis, indicating \u03b2ig-h3 as an essential survival factor, which expression levels regulate differentiation and maintenance of HSC.
