    "abstract_text": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) revolutionized the treatment of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase - positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). However, it is unlikely that TKIs will \"cure\" the disease in majority of patients because CML-CP cells are elusive targets even for the most advanced therapies employing second and third generation of TKIs. Therefore, new treatment modalities are necessary to improve therapeutic outcomes. We showed before that class I p21-activated serine/threonine kinases (PAKs) remained active in TKI-naive and TKI-treated CML-CP leukemia stem and early progenitor cells. The aim of the study was to test whether simultaneous inhibition of signaling pathways activated by BCR-ABL1 and PAK kinases may improve the treatment of CML. Special attention was focused on PAK1 and PAK2, which are expressed in hematopoietic cells and can play an important role in the promotion of CML cells proliferation and survival. PAK kinases were targeted by small molecule inhibitor IPA-3 (inhibitor of PAK1) and shRNA construct for PAK2, BCR-ABL1 kinase was inhibited by imatinib. The studies were carried out using (i) primary CML-CP stem/early progenitor cells and normal hematopoietic counterparts isolated from the bone marrow of newly diagnosed CML-CP patients and healthy donors, respectively, (ii) CML-blast phase cell lines (K562 and KCL-22), and (iii) BCR-ABL1-transformed 32Dcl3 cell line cells. We show here that inhibition of PAK1 or/and PAK2 kinases activity enhanced the effect of IM against CML cells without affecting normal counterparts. We observed that the combined use of IM with IPA-3 increased growth inhibition and apoptosis of leukemia cells. To evaluate the type of drugs interaction median effect analysis method was used. The studies revealed that the type and strength of drug interaction depend on drug concentration. Generally, combination of IM with IPA-3 at the 50% of the cell kill level (EC50) generated synergistic effect. Altogether, we postulate that BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitor should be combined with PAK1/2 inhibitor to facilitate eradication of CML cells. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
