    "abstract_text": "Integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 exists in a low-affinity state and requires activation for high-affinity binding with soluble ligands. \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation is linked to rearrangements of the \u03b23 I-like domain structure and the largest movement in the \u03b23 I-like domain following ligand binding occurs in the \u03b26-\u03b17 loop. Although this loop does not comprise a ligand binding site, a recent mutational study has shown that introduction of disulfide bonds into the \u03b26/\u03b17 region to lock the \u03b23 I-like domain in the open or closed conformation renders \u03b1IIb\u03b23 constitutively active or inactive, suggesting the regulatory role of this region in integrin activation. However, it remains to be determined which residues of the \u03b26-\u03b17 loop in the \u03b2 I-like domain are critical for integrin activation. We therefore conducted alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the \u03b26-\u03b17 loop residues in the \u03b23 I-like domain and tested for ligand binding to mutant \u03b23 integrins. The \u03b26-\u03b17 loop is composed of residues from S334 to N339, and the region between L333 and V340 was targeted for mutagenesis. The mutant \u03b23 cDNA was transfected into CHO cells together with wild-type \u03b1IIb cDNA. The expression of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mutants on the cell surface was 56\u2013116% that of the wild-type \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Then binding of an activation-dependent antibody. PAC1, to the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mutants was examined in the presence or absence of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23-activating antibody PT25-2. As expected, wild-type \u03b1IIb\u03b23 showed PAC1 binding only after activation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 by PT25-2. The L333A, S334A, M335A and V340A mutations had no effect on PAC1 binding. In contrast, the S337A and N339A mutations induced significant PAC1 binding in the absence of PT25-2, indicating a constitutively active state. Although the D336A and S338A mutations retained \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in an inactive state in the absence of PT25-2, they induced 3- and 4.5-fold as much PAC1 binding as wild-type \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in response to PT25-2, respectively. The S337A and N339A mutations, which rendered \u03b1IIb\u03b23 constitutively active, induced further PAC1 binding in the presence of PT25-2 (2.7~5.1-fold as much PAC1 binding as wild-type \u03b1IIb\u03b23). When soluble fibrinogen was used instead of PAC1, similar results were obtained. None of the mutations tested had any effect on PT25-2 binding. We next quantified adhesion of CHO cells stably expressing mutant or wild-type \u03b1IIb\u03b23 to immobilized fibrinogen. The S337A and N339A mutations enhanced cell adhesion to fibrinogen and the extent of adhesion of the mutants was comparable to that of wild-type \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activated by Mn 2+ . To determine whether the mutations of the \u03b23 subunit responsible for \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation also induce constitutive activation of \u03b1V\u03b23, CHO cells expressing \u03b1V\u03b23 mutants were tested for soluble fibrinogen binding. The surface expression of mutant \u03b1V\u03b23 was comparable to that of wild-type \u03b1V\u03b23. The \u03b1V\u03b23S337A and N339A mutants bound significantly more fibrinogen than wild-type \u03b1V\u03b23 without any stimulation, indicating that the S337A and N339A mutations also rendered another \u03b23 integrin, \u03b1V\u03b23, constitutively active. These results suggest that the S337 and N339 residues in the \u03b23 I-like domain are essential for constraining \u03b23 integrins in a default low-affinity state and that structural rearrangement in the 336 DSSN sequence of the \u03b26-\u03b17 loop alters the affinity state of \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Since the DSSN sequence is highly conserved among integrin \u03b2 subunits, this motif may be a common regulatory component of integrin activation.",
