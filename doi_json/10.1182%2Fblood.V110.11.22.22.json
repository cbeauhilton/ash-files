    "article_date": "November 16, 2007",
    "session_type": "Clinical Results - Autologous Transplantation",
    "abstract_text": "Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is widely used in relapsed or refractory low grade lymphoma with conditioning regimen including chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation (TBI). Radiolabelled immunotherapy 90Yttrium ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) is effective in B-cell lymphoma and delivers targeted radiation without TBI toxicity. To take advantage of this antilymphoma effect, conventional dose of 90Yttrium ibritumomab tiuxetan 15 MBq/kg (maximum 1200 MBq, total dose) was given without dosimetry day -14 before ASCT and combined to standard BEAM regimen starting at day -7. The goal of this phase II study was to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of Z BEAM. Patients < 65 years with CD20+ low grade B cell Lymphoma in 1st or 2nd relapses, or not achieving complete remission after first line treatment were included in the trial. They had to be chemosensitive to last salvage therapy, no more than three lines of treatment and eligible for ASCT. The primary end point was to detect a 2 yrs EFS at least 80%. Hematological reconstitution was evaluated after transplant and during the first year follow up. From 3/2005 to 8/2006, 77 patients were included. Patients characteristics at inclusion: 90% follicular lymphoma, median age 53 yr. (31\u201364), FLIPI  1G/L 12 days (9\u201335), time to platelets >20 G/L 12 days (3\u201342). Median number of platelets transfusions 4; red blood cell transfusions 2. Grade 3-4 toxicities were: infection 83%, mucositis 47%, pulmonary 4%. Safety data indicated 35 serious adverse events in 24 patients that did not appear to significantly differ from those usually seen after ASCT. No toxic death was observed. At week 12 and 42 after ASCT, median haemoglobin level were 11.6 g/dl and 11.3 g/dl, median platelets counts was 111G/L and 148 G/L, leucocytes counts 3.48 G/L and 4.80 G/L respectively. Only 5 events were reported. After a minimum follow up of one year for all patients, estimated 2 years EFS is 93%. Updated results on survival will be reported. Conclusion: Z BEAM is a safe conditioning regimen which can be used for B cell lymphoma. Longer follow up is necessary to evaluate long term toxicity and efficacy. Further randomized study are warranted.",
