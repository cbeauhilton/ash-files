    "abstract_text": "P-BCMA-101 is a novel chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell product targeting B Cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA). P-BCMA-101 is produced using the piggyBac\u00ae (PB) DNA Modification System instead of the viral vector that is used with most CAR-T cells, requiring only plasmid DNA and mRNA. This makes it less costly and produces cells with a high percentage of the favorable T stem cell memory phenotype (T SCM ). The higher cargo capacity of PB permits the incorporation of multiple genes in addition to CAR(s), including a safety switch allowing for rapid CAR-T cell elimination with a small molecule drug infusion in patients if desired, and a selection gene allowing for enrichment of CAR+ cells. Rather than using a traditional antibody-based binder, P-BCMA-101 has a Centyrin\u2122 fused to a CD3\u03b6/4-1BB signaling domain. Centyrins are fully human proteins with high specificity and a large range of binding affinities, but are smaller, more stable and potentially less immunogenic than traditional scFv. Cumulatively, these features are predicted to result in a greater therapeutic index. A Phase 1, 3+3 dose escalation from 0.75 to 15 x 10 6 P-BCMA-101 CAR-T cells/kg (RP2D 6-15 x 10 6 cells/kg) was conducted in patients with r/r MM (Blood 2018 132:1012) demonstrating excellent efficacy and safety of P-BCMA-101, including notably low rates and grades of CRS and neurotoxicity (maximum Grade 2 without necessitating ICU admission, safety switch activation or other aggressive measures). These results supported FDA RMAT designation and initiation of a pivotal Phase 2 study. A Phase 2 pivotal portion of this study has recently been designed and initiated (PRIME; NCT03288493) in r/r MM patients who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy. Their therapy must have contained a proteasome inhibitor, an IMiD, and CD38 targeted therapy with at least 2 of the prior lines in the form of triplet combinations. They must also have undergone \u22652 cycles of each line unless PD was the best response, refractory to the most recent line of therapy, and undergone autologous stem cell transplant or not be a candidate. Patients are required to be >=18 years old, have measurable disease by International Myeloma Working Group criteria (IMWG; Kumar 2016), adequate vital organ function and lack significant autoimmune, CNS and infectious diseases. No pre-specified level of BCMA expression is required, as this has not been demonstrated to correlate with clinical outcomes for P-BCMA-101 and other BCMA-targeted CAR-T products. Interestingly, unlike most CAR-T products patients may receive P-BCMA-101 after prior CAR-T cells or BCMA targeted agents, and may be multiply infused with P-BCMA-101. Patients are apheresed to harvest T cells, P-BCMA-101 is then manufactured and administered to patients as a single intravenous (IV) dose (6-15 x 10 6 P-BCMA-101 CAR-T cells/kg) after a standard 3-day cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m 2 /day) / fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 /day) conditioning regimen. One hundred patients are planned to be treated with P-BCMA-101. Uniquely, given the safety profile demonstrated during Phase 1, no hospital admission is required and patients may be administered P-BCMA-101 in an outpatient setting. The primary endpoints are safety and response rate by IMWG criteria. With a 100-subject sample, the Phase 2 part of the trial will have 90% power to detect a 15-percentage point improvement over a 30% response rate (based on that of the recently approved anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab), using an exact test for a binomial proportion with a 1-sided 0.05 significance level. Multiple biomarkers are being assessed including BCMA and cytokine levels, CAR-T cell kinetics, immunogenicity, T cell receptor diversity, CAR-T cell and patient gene expression (e.g. Nanostring) and others. Overall, the PRIME study is the first pivotal study of the unique P-BCMA-101 CAR-T product, and utilizes a number of novel design features. Studies are being initiated in combination with approved therapeutics and earlier lines of therapy with the intent of conducting Phase 3 trials.
