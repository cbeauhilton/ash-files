    "abstract_text": "Although psychological and social factors are recognized as being important in the evaluation of patients for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), no standard approach to psychosocial assessment currently exists. In solid organ transplantation, psychosocial assessments have been integrated into the selection of appropriate candidates, and certain psychosocial variables, such as active substance abuse, have been shown to negatively impact outcomes in solid organ transplant patients. To determine whether similar factors impact outcomes in patients undergoing HSCT, we prospectively conducted psychosocial assessments on 221 consecutive patients (155 autologous, 66 allogeneic) undergoing HSCT. The relationship between psychosocial variables, such as those assessed on the Transplant Evaluation Rating Scale (TERS), and objective outcomes, such as length of hospitalization and survival was evaluated. Based on the patient\u2019s TERS score, each patient was stratified into one of two groups (low/moderate risk (n=187) vs. high risk (n=34)) based on their predicted psychosocial risk for problems during transplant. Although the two groups were similar in regards to known pre-transplant prognostic factors such as age, performance status, disease risk, and transplant type, there was a significant difference in the median length of hospitalization between patients who score low/moderate (10 days) and those who scored high (21.5 days) on the TERS. This difference was significant both for patients receiving autologous (9 vs. 15 days, p<.02) and allogeneic transplants (16 vs. 45 days, p<.001). Furthermore, 2-year overall survival was significantly improved in allogeneic transplant patients who score low/moderate vs. those that scored high on the TERS (72% vs. 46%; p<=.02). These findings suggest a strong correlation between pre-transplant psychosocial risk factors, resource utilization and patient outcome in HSCT. Figure 1.
