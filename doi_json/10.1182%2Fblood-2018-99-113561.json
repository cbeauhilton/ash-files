    "abstract_text": "Objective This analysis was conducted to understand the clinical practice on FL treatment in patients with MM across EU5 countries. Methods Real world data were collected through Adelphi's Disease-Specific Programme TM - a point in time survey administered to physicians (n=241) in EU5 countries between Nov 2017 - Feb 2018. Stem Cell Transplant eligibility and treatments, including number of cycles and dosage, were collected from patient record forms (n=1952). Summary statistics were reported and analysed descriptively. Results Data on FL treatment was collected for 1952 patients; 988 (51%) were still on FL treatment at the time of data collection. Bortezomib-based regimens were used in more than 70% of patients - in both transplanted/transplant eligible (TE, n=572) and non-transplanted/transplant ineligible patients (TIE, n= 1380). In TIE patients, bortezomib, melphalan and dexamethasone (VMP) was the most commonly used regimen, covering almost one third of the patients (31%), followed by bortezomib, either in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (VCD, 10%) or thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTD, 10%). The other two FL regimens currently approved in Europe - thalidomide, melphalan and dexamethasone (MPT) and lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) have patient shares of 9% each. When analyzing the TIE patients undergoing FL treatment at time of data collection (n=606), VMP remained the most used regimen (29%) and Rd the second (15%), with VTD and MPT being used in 8% of patients. In TE patients, VTD was the most commonly used induction regimen, being used in 50% of patients, followed by VCD (21%). The numbers remained the same when analyzing the TE patients in FL treatment at time of data collection (n=382), with 54% and 22% using VTD and VCD, respectively. Conclusions Collectively these results indicate that bortezomib-based regimens remain the standard of care in FL treatment of MM in EU5, in both transplant and non-transplant settings.
