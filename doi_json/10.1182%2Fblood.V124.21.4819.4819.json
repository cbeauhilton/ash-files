    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Complement factor D, a serine protease, plays an essential role in the activation of the alternative complement pathway and provides important amplification of the classical and lectin complement pathways. Cleavage of factor B by factor D generates C3 convertase that leads to opsonization of targeted surfaces with complement activation fragments and to the formation of the terminal complement complex (TCC); both events lead to cell lysis. Complement dysregulation underlies multiple hematological disorders including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which is characterized by complement-mediated lysis of clonal populations of erythrocytes that lack glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored complement regulators. The current treatment for PNH is intravenous infusion of the anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab. Although eculizumab lessens intravascular hemolysis, it does not prevent opsonization of erythrocytes and subsequent extravascular hemolysis by immune cells. In contrast, factor D inhibitors are expected to inhibit both terminal complement pathway activation as well as opsonization and should, therefore, be well-positioned to potentially serve this unmet medical need. Herein, we present the preclinical evaluation of our small-molecule inhibitors of factor D including potency, off-target activities, metabolism, and pharmacokinetic properties. METHODS & RESULTS: Initial inhibitors were discovered through laboratory and virtual screening efforts. A high-resolution (1.5 \u00c5) X-ray structure of an early proprietary inhibitor co-crystallized with factor D aided our optimization campaign that culminated in compounds with IC 50 values below 100 nM in biochemical protease assays using natural and non-specific substrates. The potent inhibitory effect of the compounds on factor D protease activity translated to inhibition of cell lysis in an alternative pathway hemolytic assay with EC 50 values as low as single-digit nM. These small molecules are highly selective for factor D and displayed no significant inhibitory effect on a panel of human serine proteases. In accordance with the high selectivity, the inhibitors showed minimal cellular toxicity, no effect on multiple human receptor-ligand interactions, and no inhibition of hERG potassium channel current. Finally, oral and intravenous administration of selected lead compounds to preclinical animal species showed pharmacokinetic properties that suggest their suitability for oral dosing in humans. CONCLUSIONS: We have discovered highly active small-molecule inhibitors of factor D that demonstrate oral bioavailability and low off-target activities. These key attributes, and the potential to inhibit both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis through inhibition of both terminal complement pathway and opsonization, position these inhibitors as promising development candidates for the oral treatment of PNH.
