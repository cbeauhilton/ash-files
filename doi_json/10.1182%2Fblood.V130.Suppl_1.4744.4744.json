    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is characterized by production of auto-antibodies that bind to antigen on the erythrocyte surface that leads to its premature destruction and removal from the circulation by macrophages. Occurrence of AIHA in children and adolescents is rare, exact incidence unknown. Objective of this retrospective study was to assess clinical and laboratory characteristics, and management outcome of patients diagnosed with AIHA seen at Pediatric Hematology/Oncology department of King Faisal specialist Hospital and Research Center ,Riyadh from 2005 to 2014. Method: Retrospective chart review of patients (1-14 yrs.) diagnosed with AIHA was conducted. Children were excluded if they have congenital hemolytic anemia, such as hemoglobinopathies, congenital membranopathy and erythrocyte enzyme deficiencies. Result: Thirty-one patients identified, 19(61%) female and 12(39%) male with a median age at diagnosis of 6 years (0.1-12.4). The direct Coombs test was positive in 23 (74%) patients. Underlying diseases observed as cause of AIHA in 14 (45%) patients: majority secondary to viral infections followed by severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome post bone marrow transplant GVHD complication, while systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, Hyper IgE syndrome, post-liver transplant, diabetes was observed in individual cases. Remaining 17 (55%) patients diagnosed as primary AIHA .Corticosteroids and/or immunoglobulin was given as first line of treatment to 64.5% (20) patients while 35.5% (11) required Rituximab and/or splenectomy as second line of treatment, of which 73%(8) were diagnosed as primary AIHA. Five-year overall survival (Kaplan-Meir) rate of 89% was observed with twenty-seven alive patients showing partial or complete response ,while four patients died due to underlying diseases. Conclusion : Our results demonstrates patients responding to first line of treatment, however serious cases required management through second line of treatment. Further, a regional multicenter observational study will enable better understanding of differences in disease presentation and treatment outcomes.
