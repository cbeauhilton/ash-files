    "abstract_text": "The C-terminal segment of the fibrinogen \u03b3 chain plays a crucial role in platelet aggregation via its interaction with the platelet receptor \u03b1IIb\u03b23. It is well established that the last four amino acids of the \u03b3 chain (408 to 411) are critical for this function, as mutations or deletions of this region abrogate fibrinogen\u2019s ability to bind \u03b1IIb\u03b23. We describe here the first naturally occurring fibrinogen mutation affecting the C-terminal region of the \u03b3 chain and investigate its effects on platelet interactions. The proband, a 49-year-old woman, was diagnosed with dysfibrinogenemia based on a prolonged thrombin time and low fibrinogen activity (55 mg/dL). Her bleeding history was significant for menorrhagia and one episode of post-operative hemorrhage. DNA sequencing of the fibrinogen genes demonstrated heterozygosity for two mutations, \u03b3 R275C and \u03b3 V411I. The latter \u03b3 V411I mutation represents a novel mutation affecting the C-terminal amino acid of the \u03b3 chain. We hypothesized that this mutation would decrease fibrinogen\u2019s affinity for the platelet receptor \u03b1IIb\u03b23. In order to isolate the effects of this mutation on fibrinogen-platelet binding, \u03b3 400-411 dodecapeptides were synthesized to mimic the C-terminal \u03b3 chain sequence. One peptide contained the wild-type sequence ending in valine (\u03b3 400-V411), and the second peptide incorporated the isoleucine mutation (\u03b3 400-I411). Previous studies have demonstrated that the wild type \u03b3 400-V411 dodecapeptide inhibits platelet aggregation by competing for fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23. We performed platelet aggregation studies comparing inhibition of aggregation with the wild-type \u03b3 400-V411 and the mutant \u03b3 400-I411 peptides. Washed platelets were obtained from a normal donor, and platelet aggregation monitored using the agonist ADP. The IC 50 for the initial rate of aggregation with the \u03b3 400-I411 peptide was 214 \u03bcM, compared to 133 \u03bcM with the wild-type peptide. We then examined the extent of aggregation in the presence of either wild-type or mutant peptide. Consistent with the previous results, total aggregation was lower with the wild-type peptide compared to the mutant peptide. The IC 50 for the \u03b3 400-I411 peptide was 450 \u03bcM compared to 250 \u03bcM with the \u03b3 400-V411 peptide. Overall, these findings suggest that the \u03b3 I411 mutation results in a decreased ability to bind platelets. In the heterozygous state, however, the available amount of wild-type fibrinogen may be sufficient to support platelet aggregation. The bleeding diathesis observed for the proband could therefore reflect other factors, especially the \u03b3 R275C mutation.",
