    "abstract_text": "The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BZ) has significant antineoplastic activity in multiple myeloma, lymphoma and acute leukemia. Recently, it has been shown that BZ can potentiate the activity of other antitumor agents in vitro. Topoisomerase II\u03b1 (topo II\u03b1) is known to be regulated by proteasomal degradation, suggesting that proteasomal inhibition might increase intracellular topo II\u03b1 levels and thereby enhance sensitivity to topo II\u03b1-targeted agents, including etoposide, daunorubicin and mitoxantrone. Incubation with sublethal concentrations of BZ led to rapid upregulation of topo II\u03b1 protein levels in the human TF-1 AML cell line, the human 8226 myeloma cell line and the 8226-derived, topo II\u03b1-deficient, anthracycline-resistant Dox 1 V line (kindly provided by William S. Dalton), as measured by Western blot assay. Enhanced topo II\u03b1 expression was evident at 3 hrs, peaked at 6 hrs and fell off markedly 24 hrs after BZ addition. Maximal upregulation was 25\u201390 fold as measured by optical densitometry. BZ induced a shift in the apparent molecular weight of topo II\u03b1, suggesting that upregulation resulted, at least in part, from the stabilization of the ubiquitinated form(s) of the enzyme following proteasomal inhibition. The kinetics of topo II\u03b1 upregulation inversely correlated with measured 20S proteasomal activity, further supporting a post-translational mechanism. Nuclear extracts prepared from BZ-treated cells showed a corresponding 36-fold increase in topo II\u03b1 enzymatic activity. The cytotoxicity of BZ in combination with other antineoplastic agents was evaluated by MTT assay. Synergistic cytotoxicity was observed for BZ plus mitoxantrone, etoposide or daunorubicin, but no significant augmentation was observed in this system for BZ plus cytarabine, melphalan, camptothecin, dexamethasone, vincristine or fludarabine. In TF-1 AML cells, sublethal doses of BZ reduced the IC 50 for daunorubicin, mitoxantrone and etoposide 16-, 52- and 22-fold, respectively. In 8226 myeloma cells, BZ enhanced sensitivity to daunorubicin and etoposide 11- and 4-fold, respectively. Importantly, BZ treatment overcame chemoresistance in topo II\u03b1-deficient Dox 1 V myeloma cells, enhancing the sensitivity to daunorubicin and etoposide 110- and 7- fold, respectively. The observed synergy was sequence-dependent and correlated with BZ-induced upregulation of topo II\u03b1. Maximal synergy occurred within 3\u20136 hrs of BZ pretreatment and diminished after 24 hrs. Minimal synergy occurred when topo II\u03b1-targeted agents preceded BZ by \u2265 6 hrs. These findings demonstrate that BZ has synergistic cytotoxic effects with topo II\u03b1-targeted agents in AML and myeloma cell lines, which correlate with BZ-induced upregulation of topo II\u03b1 protein and nuclear enzymatic activity. Furthermore, these data provide a rationale for timed-sequential cytotoxic therapy in patients with hematologic malignancies.",
