    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1296 Understanding the transcriptional mechanisms that control hematopoiesis and the interaction between hematopoietic stem cells and the bone marrow microenvironment in vivo is of considerable interest. We have previously shown that aged mice lacking the transcription factor NFATc2 develop bone marrow hypoplasia, anemia, and extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen and liver. The proliferation and differentiation of NFATc2-deficient hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) ex vivo , however, was found to be intact. It remained therefore unclear whether the disturbed hematopoiesis in NFATc2-deficient mice was caused by the hematopoietic or the stroma component of the bone marrow hematopoietic niche. In the current study we dissected the relative contribution of hematopoietic and stroma cells to the phenotype of the NFATc2-deficent mice by transplanting immunomagnetically purified NFATc2-deficient (ko) HPCs to lethally irradiated wildtype (wt) mice, and vice versa. After a posttransplantation period of 6\u20138 months, peripheral blood, bone marrow as well as spleen and liver of the transplanted animals were analyzed and compared to wt and ko mice transplanted with control cells. Transplantation of NFATc2-deficient HPCs into wt recipients (ko \u2192 wt) induced similar hematological abnormalities as those occurring in non-transplanted ko mice or in ko mice transplanted with ko cells (ko \u2192 ko). Compared to wt mice transplanted with wt cells (wt \u2192 wt), ko \u2192 wt mice showed evidence of anemia, thrombocytopenia and a significantly reduced number of hematopoietic cells in their bone marrow. Likewise, ko \u2192 wt mice developped clear signs of extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen and liver, which was not the case in wt \u2192 wt control animals. Our data demonstrate for the first time, that NFAT transcription factors directly regulate the intrinsic function of hematopoietic progenitor cells in vivo . The transcriptional targets for NFAT in these cells are yet unknown and are the focus of further investigations. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
