    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Pro-inflammatory cytokines play an essential role as activators of the hemostatic system and in the regulation of physiological antithrombotic mechanisms. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) influences platelet production and platelet activation. It was associated with accelerated clotting and intravascular coagulation in tissue factor (TF)-driven murine thrombosis models. However, the precise role of myeloid cell-derived IL-6 on thrombosis formation and the hemostatic system is still unknown. Methods and Results: To better understand the role of IL-6 in thrombosis and the hemostatic system, we developed a new mouse strain with Cre-recombinase driven constitutive IL-6 expression specifically in myeloid cells (LysM-IL-6 OE , Control mice: IL-6 OE ). LysM-IL-6 OE mice had a prolonged tail bleeding time and lacked venous thrombus formation induced by inferior vena cava (IVC) stenosis. There were no differences in D-Dimer levels in LysM-IL-6 OE mice neither on baseline level nor after IVC ligation. However, we found unstoppable post-operative bleedings in LysM-IL-6 OE . They showed a prolonged aPTT, a significantly increased INR and a prolonged thrombin converting time. The Factor V and IX expression were reduced, but von Willebrand factor, antithrombin and fibrinogen expression were up-regulated and could not explain the missing thrombus formation. We found significantly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation in line with erythrocytes aggregates, which seemed to be mediated by IL-6 and \u03b12M. Most importantly, hepatic levels of thrombin inhibitor \u03b12 macroglobulin (\u03b12M) mRNA and protein were increased in LysM-IL-6 OE/+ mice compared to control mice. In parallel, Platelet erythrocyte interaction seemed to be essential in the development of the bleeding phenotype. Conclusions: These findings show the role of chronically elevated IL-6 in driving the accumulation of A2m on the surface of erythrocytes, thereby mediating a phenotype of increased bleeding complications.
