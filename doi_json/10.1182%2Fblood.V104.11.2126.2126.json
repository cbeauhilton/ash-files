    "abstract_text": "We hypothesize that immune tolerance after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is maintained by an active cellular mechanism that includes T reg CD4 + CD25 + cells. In the dog model of mixed hematopoietic chimerism, adoptive immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) that successfully converted recipients to all-donor chimerism required the breaking of immune tolerance to target antigens. We reasoned that depletion of T reg cells might break tolerance and could improve the therapeutic efficacy of subsequent DLI. Denileukin diftitox (DAB 389 IL-2, Ontak) is a fusion protein consisting of the translocation and ADP-ribosylase domains of diphtheria toxin and interleukin 2. DAB 389 IL-2 binds to the high affinity IL-2 receptor (CD25, CD122 and CD132) expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells. Some T reg cells express the high affinity IL-2 receptor. Although DAB 389 IL-2 has been shown to deplete alloreactive T cells, we asked if DAB 389 IL-2 could deplete T reg cells without depleting alloreactive T cells in dog mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC). First we asked if DAB 389 IL-2 could induce specific cell death of activated T cells. Five days after initiation of a one-way, dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-mismatched MLC, DAB 389 IL-2 was added to the MLC for 24 hours and cells were pulsed with 3 H-thymidine. At 10 \u221211 and 10 \u221210 M [DAB 389 IL-2] there was 34% and 92% inhibition of cell proliferation, respectively. To determine if DAB 389 IL-2 could deplete T reg cells, we established DLA-mismatched MLC (n=5) with cyclosporine (CSP) 400ng/mL (Martin, PJ et al. BBMT, 2004) and added DAB 389 IL-2 in half-log increments from 10 \u221211 to 10 \u22129.5 M on day 4 of MLC. On day 5, culture medium was changed to remove DAB 389 IL-2 and cells were analyzed for expression of CD4 and CD25. Flow cytometric analysis showed that CSP treated MLC had reduced CD4 + CD25 bright and CD4 + CD25 dim by 90 \u00b1 3.3% and 64 \u00b1 10%, respectively, compared to no CSP. DAB 389 IL-2 [10 \u221211 M] treatment of MLC with CSP decreased CD4 + CD25 bright and dim populations 31 \u00b1 12% and 30 \u00b1 4%, respectively, compared to no DAB 389 IL-2. On day 10 of the culture, cells were tested in secondary (2\u00b0) MLC to determine the effect of depleting CD4 + CD25 + cells with DAB 389 IL-2. 2\u00b0 MLC was performed without the addition CSP or DAB 389 IL-2. After 3 days of 2\u00b0 MLC, cells were assayed for proliferation. Compared to controls with no CSP or DAB 389 IL-2 treatment during 1\u00b0 MLC, depletion of CD4 + CD25 + cells with DAB 389 IL-2 increased 2\u00b0 allo-specific proliferation 36.2 \u00b1 26%. When CSP was present in the 1\u00b0 MLC, DAB 389 IL-2 treatment on day 4 increased subsequent 2\u00b0 MLC allo-specific T cell proliferation 86 \u00b1 22%. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that DAB 389 IL-2 can efficiently eliminate T reg (CD4 + CD25 + ) cells, particularly when T reg cells are generated in the presence of CSP.",
