    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4784 Background Patients with classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) have a relatively high risk of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE); reported incidence 4.6\u20137% in adults and up to 11.5% in children and adolescents. Most VTE episodes are peripheral or related to central venous catheters, with very limited data on central or life-threatening thromboses in adolescents. There is only 1 reported case series on cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) in adolescents. We report 4 cases of CVT from our centre, all treated with chemo-radiotherapy. Chemotherapy comprised OEPA (vincristine, prednisolone, doxorubicin, etoposide) and COPP/COPDAC (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone, procarbazine/dacarbazine respectively).

All were female, aged 12\u201323. All received norethisterone contraception. All had indwelling central venous catheters (PICC). Patient 4 alone had a raised body mass index. All were exposed to steroids; Patient 4 completed steroid therapy several weeks before developing CVT symptoms. Patients 2 and 4 received treatment dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for 6 weeks after diagnosis of PICC-associated thrombosis, and were not on anticoagulation or thromboprophylaxis when CVT was diagnosed. Regarding other risk factors, 3/4 had no documented prothrombotic tendency. Patient 4 was found to have a moderately positive IgM anti beta 2 glycoprotein antibody present 12 weeks apart, consistent with antiphospholipid syndrome. Table 2: Clinical Details  Patient .

LMWH of choice at our centre was dalteparin. Patient 1 was switched to warfarin upon completion of chemo-radiotherapy, and Patient 4 was commenced on warfarin with dalteparin cover at diagnosis of CVT as she had completed treatment. Patients 1 and 2 had raised intracranial pressure on lumbar puncture, and required therapeutic lumbar punctures and acetazolamide. Patients 2 and 3 both required anticonvulsant therapy for 1 year. Patient 2 was initially treated with phenytoin, and switched to carbamazepine. Patient 3 was also initially managed with phenytoin, and switched to levetiracetam. Neither patient had any subsequent seizures. All 4 patients have recovered completely from CVT with no residual neurological deficits or further thromboses. Conclusion CVT is a rare and potentially life threatening complication in adolescents and young adults with cHL with paucity of data. The risk factors are unclear however all patients in our series were female, received steroids and were on norethisterone. Only 1 patient had a prothrombotic tendency detected on thrombophila screening. CVT is treatable, and complete resolution of signs and symptoms can be expected. More studies are required to elucidate risk factors which may help develop thromboprophylaxis guidance in this group of patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
