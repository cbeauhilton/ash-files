    "abstract_text": "Internal tandem duplication (ITD) of FLT3 (fms-like tyrosine kinase 3) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with inferior clinical outcome. Sorafenib is effective in targeting chemo-refractory FLT3 -ITD + AML. However, leukemia progresses invariably. Mechanisms of drug resistance are not completely understood. We hypothesized that a gene encoding tescalcin ( TESC ), which activate a sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1) and known to be up-regulated at leukemia progression during continuous sorafenib treatment, may underlie TKI resistance. TESC was over-expressed in FLT3 -ITD + AML lines MOLM-13 and MV4-11. Knocking down TESC by siRNA lowered intracellular pH and induced apoptosis. The results were recapitulated by treatment with a NHE1 inhibitor, 5-(N,N-Hexamethylene) amiloride (HMA). Sorafenib resistant MOLM-13 cell line (M13-RE) was generated by long term culture of sorafenib. M13-RE significantly increased its sensitivity to HMA. HMA also enhanced suppression of FLT3 signaling by sorafenib in otherwise resistant cell lines. Treating MOLM-13, MV4-11 and primary FLT3 -ITD + AML cells with HMA significantly reduced leukemia initiation in NOD/SCID mouse xenotransplantation. These observations provided novel information about the pathogenetic role of the TESC-NHE1-pH i axis in mediating sorafenib resistance in AML.
