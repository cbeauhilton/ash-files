    "abstract_text": "We developed a new HCT-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI) as a sensitive tool to capture pretransplant comorbidities among pts given allogeneic HCT ( Sorror et al. Blood.  2005 ; 106 , 2912 \u20132919 ). Here, we retrospectively analyzed whether the HCT-CI was useful in assessing how pts with B cell malignancies tolerated NM vs M-HCT. Results among consecutive pts (n=125) given NM-conditioning with 2Gy total body irradiation (TBI) (19%) or 2 Gy TBI combined with 90 mg/kg of fludarabine (81%) were compared to those among concurrent M-pts (n=55) conditioned with cyclophosphamide plus busulfan (15%) or 12Gy TBI (85%). Diagnoses were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, 80% vs 52%), Hodgkin disease (HD, 5% vs 20%), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, 15% vs 28%), respectively. At HCT, NM-pts differed substantially from M-pts with respect to age (median 52 vs 40 years,), prior treatment regimens (median 5 vs 3), prior failed high-dose HCT (45% vs 9%), unrelated donors (43% vs 18%), and G-PBMC as stem cell source (99% vs 78%). Smaller differences existed for disease chemo-sensitivity (58% vs 69%) and aggressive disease (56% vs 64%). HCT-CI scores >0 were found among 70% and 58% of NM and M-pts, respectively. After HCT, 2-year NRM and survival were 26% and 59% vs 29% and 51% among NM and M-pts, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in NRM (19% vs 4%, p =0.3) and survival (70% vs 70%, p =0.7) between NM and M-pts with HCT-CI scores of 0; however, this comparison was limited by the small numbers of non-relapse deaths. NM-pts with HCT-CI scores of \u2265 1 had statistically significantly lower NRM (29% vs 47%, HR=0.50, p =0.03, Figure) and better survival (54% vs 37%, HR=0.60 p =0.05) compared to M-pts. These differences remained after adjusting for pretransplant differences (NRM, HR=0.3, p =0.006; survival, HR=0.33, p =0.002). In a further analysis which included all pts, increasing HCT-CI scores and M-conditioning were important risk factors for NRM and survival (Table). We concluded that pts with B cell malignancies and HCT-CI scores of \u22651 tolerated NM-HCT better than M-HCT, and prospective randomized trials may be warranted to confirm this result. Additional data are needed to clarify possible differences between M and NM-conditioning for patients without comorbidities. Table: Multivariate risk factors for HCT outcomes  . . NRM .
