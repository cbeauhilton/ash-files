    "abstract_text": "Abstract 909 Genomic instability is a hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) resulting in the appearance of clones carrying BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations encoding resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and/or those harboring additional chromosomal aberrations, eventually leading to disease relapse and/or malignant progression to blast phase (CML-BP) [Skorski, T., Leukemia and Lymphoma, 2011]. We found that Lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 \u2212 human leukemia stem cells (huLSCs), including the quiescent sub-population, and Lin \u2212 CD34 + CD38 + human leukemia progenitor cells (huLPCs) accumulate high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in numerous oxidative DNA lesions such as 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) [Nieborowska-Skorska, Blood, 2012]. huLSCs and huLPCs treated with TKIs continue to exhibit ROS-induced oxidative DNA damage suggesting the persistence of genomic instability in TKI-treated patients. Furthermore, genomic instability in TKI-refractory huLSCs and TKI-sensitive huLPCs may have a varying impact on disease progression and determining novel treatment modalities. To determine if TKI-refractory huLSCs are a source of genomic instability we employed a tetracycline-inducible murine model of CML-CP: SCLtTA/p210BCR-ABL1. Mice exhibiting CML-CP -like disease demonstrated splenomegaly, leukocytosis, and expansion of mature Gr1 + /CD11b + cells. ROS were elevated in Lin \u2212 c-Kit + Sca-1 + cells (muLSCs), but not Lin \u2212 c-Kit + Sca-1 \u2212 cells (muLPCs), which was associated with higher mRNA expression of BCR-ABL1 in muLSCs. In addition, ROS levels were directly proportional to BCR-ABL1 kinase expression in transduced CD34 + human hematopoietic cells, thus confirming the \u201cdosage-dependent\u201d effect of BCR-ABL1 on ROS. Among the Lin \u2212 c-Kit + Sca-1 + cells, enhanced ROS were detected in TKI-refractory quiescent muLSCs, in CD34 \u2212 Flt3 \u2212 long-term and CD34 + Flt3 \u2212 short-term muLSCs, and also in CD34 + Flt3 + multipotent progenitors. High levels of ROS in muLSCs were accompanied by aberrant expression of genes regulating ROS metabolism (mitochondrial electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation, hydrogen peroxide synthesis, and detoxification). In addition, muLSCs, including the quiescent sub-population, displayed high levels of oxidative DNA lesions (8-oxoG, and DSBs). ROS-induced oxidative DNA damage in muLSCs was accompanied by genomic instability in CML-CP \u2013like mice, which accumulated a broad range of genetic aberrations recapitulating the heterogeneity of sporadic mutations detected in TKI-naive CML-CP patients. These aberrations include TKI-resistant BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations, deletions in Ikzf1 and Trp53 and additions in Zfp423 and Idh1 genes, which have been associated with CML-CP relapse and progression to CML-BP. Imatinib caused only modest inhibition of ROS and oxidative DNA damage in TKI-refractory muLSCs. In concordance, CML-CP \u2013like mice treated with imatinib continued to accumulate genomic aberrations. Since BCR-ABL1(K1172R) kinase-dead mutant expressed in CD34 + human hematopoietic cells did not enhance ROS, it suggests that BCR-ABL1 kinase-independent mechanisms contribute to genomic instability. In summary, we postulate that ROS-induced oxidative DNA damage resulting in genetic instability may originate in the most primitive TKI-refractory huLSCs in TKI-naive and TKI-treated patients.
