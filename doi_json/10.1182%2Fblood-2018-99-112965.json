    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma is characterized by the production of monoclonal protein by clonal plasma cells and is a malignancy inherently susceptible to agents that disrupt protein homeostasis. We have previously demonstrated that targeting the geranylgeranylation of Rab GTPases is a novel mechanism by which to induce myeloma cell apoptosis via disruption of intracellular monoclonal protein trafficking and induction of the unfolded protein response pathway. Our previous efforts have focused on the development of novel triazole isoprenoid bisphosphonates as inhibitors of the enzyme geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGDPS). GGDPS is responsible for the synthesis of the 20-carbon isoprenoid (GGDP) that is utilized in protein geranylgeranylation reactions. Extensive structure-function analysis of the triazole-based inhibitors has revealed that both chain length and olefin stereochemistry have significant impact on inhibitor potency. Previous reports have utilized triazoles as bioisoteres of amides and we hypothesized that the converse might be true as well; namely that amides analogous to the triazoles would have efficacy as GGDPS inhibitors. To this end, we have prepared a number of novel isoprenoid amide bisphosphonates as potential GGDPS inhibitors. These new compounds were prepared from bisphosphonate 1 through a short reaction sequence including chain extension by conjugate addition of nitromethane, reduction to the amine 2 , amide formation through reaction with a variety of carboxylic acids, and final hydrolysis of the phosphonate esters to obtain the salts 3 . These analogues differed with respect to chain length (ranging from bishomoprenyl- to bishomogeranyl-length), olefin stereochemistry ( E vs Z ), absence of the proximal olefin (i.e., citronellyl) as well as the stereochemistry of the citronellyl derivatives ( R vs S ). All of the novel compounds were subjected to in vitro enzyme assays with GGDPS as well as for the related enzymes farnesyl diphosphate synthase, farnesyl transferase and geranylgeranyl transferase I, and IC 50 's were determined. Cellular activity in human myeloma cell lines (RPMI-8226, MM.1S) was assessed via immunoblot analysis of representative prenylated proteins. In addition, ELISA of intracellular levels of lambda light chain (a marker of disruption of Rab geranylgeranylation) was performed. These studies reveal that similar to the previously reported triazoles, both chain length and olefin stereochemistry have significant effects on GGDPS inhibitory activity. Extending the chain length from the bishomoprenyl length to the bishomogeranyl length increased cellular activity 50-fold: the lowest effective concentration (LEC) is 50 \u03bcM for the bishomoprenyl compound and 1 \u03bcM for the bishomogeranyl compound. Furthermore, changing the olefin stereochemistry to the bishomoneryl form (i.e., the Z -configuration), further enhanced the potency to an LEC of 0.5 \u03bcM. Interestingly, the stereochemistry of the citronellyl derivatives were found to have a significant impact on activity with the R -enantiomer being 10-fold more potent than the S -enantiomer (LEC of 5 \u03bcM vs 50 \u03bcM respectively). Enzyme assay studies confirmed the specificity of these agents as GGDPS inhibitors. In conclusion, these studies establish a novel family of amide isoprenoid bisphosphonates as GGDPS inhibitors with activity against myeloma cells. Further structure-function analysis will better define the optimal chain length and stereochemistry to maximize potency and enable future in vivo studies assessing efficacy as anti-myeloma therapy.
