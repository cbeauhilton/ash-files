    "abstract_text": "A 88 year-old woman was referred to our center for 3 weeks of gastrointestinal bleeding and a spontaneous right rectus femoris hematoma. The prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT) and reptilase time (RT) were markedly prolonged ( Table 1 ). Assays for coagulation factors V, VIII, IX and X were normal. A fibrinogen concentration of < 50 mg/dl was measured by Clauss method while fibrinogen concentration measured by radial immunodiffusion was 180 mg/dl. Following infusions of cryoprecipitate there was accelerated clearance of fibrinogen as measured by the Clauss method. An inhibitor of fibrinogen function was suspected. Table 1 Test .

The IgG antibody was polyclonal comprising of both kappa and lambda subtypes. View large Download slide View large Download slide The IgG fraction was purified on a Protein A column and the isolated IgG fraction prolonged the thrombin time of normal plasma in a concentration dependent manner. The effect of the isolated IgG fraction on fibrin polymerization was measured by monitoring the absorbance at \u03bb390 in a spectrophotometer. The IgG inhibited fibrin polymerization in a concentration dependent manner. Control IgGs had no significant effect on polymerization under these conditions ( Figure 2 ). View large Download slide View large Download slide The immunologic specificity of antibody was tested in immunoblots of fibrinogen subjected to SDS-PAGE. The patients IgG reacted with fibrinogen in unreduced buffers. Under reducing conditions, the IgG reacted with B\u03b2 and \u03b3 chains of fibrinogen while the control IgG did not ( Figure 3 ). View large Download slide View large Download slide The patient was treated with rituximab and steroids. After four, weekly doses of rituximab, fibrinogen levels by Clauss method normalized (450 mg/dl). There was no detectable antibody to fibrinogen and no further bleeding was noted. Conclusion This is a description of a rare case of a polyclonal autoantibody to B\u03b2 and \u03b3 chains of fibrinogen that inhibited fibrin polymerization leading to a severe bleeding diathesis.
