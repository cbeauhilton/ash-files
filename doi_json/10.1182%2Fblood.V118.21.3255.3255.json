    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3255 The platelet \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin receptor plays a central role in hemostasis and thrombosis. Small molecule inhibitors of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 based on the RGD cell recognition sequence block ligand binding by interacting with \u03b1IIb D224 via their positively-charged (R-like) group and coordinating the Mg 2+ ion in the metal ion adhesion site (MIDAS) via their carboxyl (D-like) group. We recently reported a novel inhibitor of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 (RUC-1) that binds exclusively to \u03b1IIb and we now report the structure-based design and synthesis of RUC-2 [2-amino-N-(3-(5-oxo-7-(piperazin-1-yl)-5H-[1,3,4]thiadiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-2-yl)phenyl)acetamide; MW 385], a RUC-1 derivative with \u223c100-fold higher affinity and an IC 50 = \u223c90 nM for ADP-induced platelet aggregation. RUC-2, like RUC-1 shows specificity for \u03b1IIb\u03b23 compared to \u03b1V\u03b23 and produces much less exposure of the \u03b23 LIBS1 epitope than does eptifibatide (eptifibatide=100%, untreated platelets=22\u00b13 %; RUC-2=21\u00b13%). RUC-2 also produces less of a global conformational change in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 compared to eptifibatide as measured by dynamic light scattering, gel permeation chromatography, and electron microscopic imaging of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in nanodiscs. X-ray crystallography of RUC-2 soaked into the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 headpiece in 1 mM Ca 2+ and 5 mM Mg 2+ at 2.6 A\u030a revealed that RUC-2 binds to \u03b1IIb much the way RUC-1 does, but in addition it binds to one of the sidechain carboxyl oxygens of the \u03b23 MIDAS residue Glu-220, thus displacing Mg 2+ from the MIDAS. When RUC-2 was soaked into the crystal in the presence of 20 mM Mg 2+ , however, the Mg 2+ was identified in the MIDAS and RUC-2 was absent from the pocket. Molecular dynamics simulations were in accord with the X-ray crystallographic data. Support for competition between RUC-2 and Mg 2+ for binding to the MIDAS came from studies showing that increasing the Mg 2+ concentration significantly decreased RUC-2's ability to inhibit PAC-1 binding to CHO cells expressing \u03b1IIb\u03b23, platelet adhesion to fibrinogen, and thrombin receptor activating peptide-induced platelet aggregation. We conclude that RUC-2 inhibits ligand binding with high affinity and specificity by a novel mechanism in which it competes with Mg 2+ for Glu-220, and as such may offer advantages as a therapeutic agent.

Ca 2+ ions of SyMBS or ADMIDAS (yellow) are shown as spheres. RUC-2 and selected \u03b1IIb\u03b23 sidechain and backbone atoms are shown as sticks with green (RUC-2), light blue (\u03b1IIb), or wheat carbons (\u03b23), red oxygens, blue nitrogens, and yellow sulphurs. Water molecules are small red spheres. Hydrogen and metal coordination bonds are shown as dashed blue lines.
