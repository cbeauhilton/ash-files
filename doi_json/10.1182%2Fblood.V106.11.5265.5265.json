    "abstract_text": "Introduction: At moment PBSC collections can be performed using semiautomated or automated cell separator devices. The collection with semiautomated methods implies an augmented working load for the dedicated personnel and is strongly influenced by the operator. On the contrary, the automated methods offer the advantages of a diminuished working load for the dedicated personnel and an high standardization of the collection procedure. Herein we report our experience on 60 PBSC collections employing the new automated COM.TEC Fresenius autoMNC program that provides the possibility to predict the total number of CD34+ cells collected basing on the CD34+ cell count (x \u03bcL) pre-leukapheresis (LKF) collection in peripheral blood. Materials and Methods: 39 patients affected with various onchohematological diseases and10 healty donors were mobilized with chemotherapy + G-CSF or G-CSF alone, respectively, and subsequently underwent LKF collection for auto or allotransplant. According to our internal protocol 60 LKF collections were performed starting with a CD34+ cell count in peripheral blood at least of 20/\u03bcL. Net weight of the final LKF product and its CD34+ cell content were evaluated at the end of each PBSC collection procedure and then compared to the expected data calculated by the cell separator device. Moreover a post collection peripheral blood Plt count was evaluated for each patient/donor. Results: The mean starting WBC count was 25.86x10 3 /\u03bcL (range: 4\u201382.3), Plt count was 151.38x10 3 /\u03bcL (20\u2013395), CD34+ cells was 96.63/\u03bcL (20\u2013332). The mean WBC and CD34+ cells in the LKF collection were 224.78x10 3 /\u03bcL (20.71\u2013425.3) and 565.45x10 6 (59.3\u20131609.3), respectively. The mean volume of the LKF collection was 237.28 ml (120\u2013503). The mean estimated CD34+ cell content was 498.37x10 6 while the real mean CD34+ LKF cell content was 623.32x10 6 . The mean CD34+ cell collection efficiency was 91% (66\u2013126). Finally, the mean post procedure Plt count in patient/donor was 77.91x10 3 /\u03bcL (12\u2013164). Conclusions: The automatized PBSC collection with the new program COM.TEC Fresenius autoMNC demonstrated a very high CD34+ cell collection efficiency. Moreover the possibility to predict the CD34+ cell yield permits an optimal management of the LKF collection, reducing the number of procedures per patient/donor. The difference observed between the mean estimated CD34+ cells and the real CD34+ cell content may be due to the intra-procedure stem cell mobilization phenomenon. Finally, this new automatized collection system demonstrated to limit the collection related thrombocytopenia either in patient or in donor.",
