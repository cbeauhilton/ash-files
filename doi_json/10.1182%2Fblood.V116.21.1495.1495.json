    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1495 Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a heterogenous group of disorders characterized by an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. Recently, our discovery of G6PC3 deficiency in 12 patients with SCN and various developmental features highlighted the role of glucose metabolism in the viability of neutrophil granulocytes. To further delineate the molecular and clinical phenotype of this complex syndrome, we analyzed a second cohort of 23 SCN patients referred to us for molecular analysis of G6PC3 mutations. All patients had at least one syndromic feature in addition to congenital neutropenia such as such as congenital heart defects, urogenital malformations or increased venous marking. Among these 23 patients, we identified 14 patients with biallelic mutations in G6PC3 . 10 patients had novel mutations in G6PC3 . A comprehensive review of the clinical characteristics of these patients underlined the phenotypic variability of G6PC3 deficiency. In addition to known manifestations including cardiac (14/14) and urogenital malformations such as cryptorchidism (3/14), novel features such as facial dysmorphy (11/14) or malformation of the outer genitalia (4/14) were found. No obvious genotype-phenotype correlations could be established. All patients except one had a good response to treatment with G-CSF characterized by increased peripheral neutrophil counts and decreased frequency and severity of infections. To assess the risk of leukemogenesis, we performed a meta-analysis comparing the 14 G6PC3-deficient SCN patients combined with the 12 patients in the original publication with a cohort of 374 patients SCN patients bearing mutations in ELANE or HAX1 , in which 61 developed MDS or AML. The rate of MDS/AML was found to be significantly lower in G6PC3-deficient patients (p=0.02). Our analysis suggests that the risk of transition to MDS/AML may be lower in G6PC3-deficient SCN compared with other genetically defined SCN subgroups.
