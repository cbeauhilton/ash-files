    "abstract_text": "The successful development of stem cell-based therapies requires a thorough understanding of human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations. Human CD34 \u2212 cells engraft NOD/SCID mice with low efficiency by intravenous (IV) transplant. However, intra-femoral injection into immune deficient mice has identified potent human repopulating cells from CD34 + and CD34 \u2212 subfractions. We recently described a novel strategy to purify reconstituting HSC from human umbilical cord blood (UCB) by lineage depletion (Lin \u2212 ) followed by selection of cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. Hematopoietic progenitor function and in vivo reconstituting ability were exclusively maintained within the ALDH hi Lin \u2212 population, which demonstrated variable expression of CD34. Here, we compared the repopulating ability of purified CD34 + ALDH hi Lin \u2212 and CD34 \u2212 ALDH hi Lin \u2212 populations to traditionally isolated CD34 + Lin \u2212 and CD34 \u2212 Lin \u2212 cells. Sorting of Lin \u2212 cells from human UCB isolated CD34 \u2212 ALDH hi and CD34 + ALDH hi cells (>96% purity) at an overall frequency of 4.4\u00b11.3% or 29.1\u00b13.5%, respectively. In contrast to CD34 \u2212 Lin \u2212 cells, ALDH hi CD34 \u2212 Lin \u2212 cells demonstrated robust clonogenic progenitor function in vitro (1 CFU in 9 cells, n=3), and total colony production was further increased in ALDH hi CD34 + Lin \u2212 cells (1 CFU in 4.5 cells, n=4) (p<0.05). Human hematopoietic repopulation was consistently observed in the bone marrow (17.2\u00b14.2%), spleen (0.8\u00b10.2%), and peripheral blood (0.7\u00b10.3%) of NOD/SCID \u03b22M null mice 6\u20138 weeks after IV transplant with 10 3 \u201310 4 purified ALDH hi CD34 + Lin \u2212 cells (n=14). Similarly, intra-femoral injection (IF) of ALDH hi CD34 + Lin \u2212 cells resulted in robust human repopulation (n=5). IV injection of equivalent doses of either ALDH hi CD34 + Lin \u2212 or CD34 + Lin \u2212 cells showed similar levels and frequencies of human hematopoietic engraftment. Repopulating ALDH hi CD34 + Lin \u2212 cells also differentiated into cells expressing markers for mature myeloid (CD33, CD14), B-lymphoid (CD19, CD20) cells and primitive repopulating cells (CD34 + CD38 \u2212 ) at similar frequencies as CD34 + Lin \u2212 cells (n=5). IV injection of 2x10 4 \u20131x10 5 ALDH hi CD34 \u2212 Lin \u2212 cells engrafted at 0.2\u20130.3% in the BM of 3 of 4 NOD/SCID \u03b22M null mice, whereas IV injection of up to 4x10 5 CD34 \u2212 Lin \u2212 cells produced no detectable human engraftment (n=6). IF-injected ALDH hi CD34 \u2212 Lin \u2212 cells engrafted the injected bone in 2 of 3 NOD/SCID mice at low levels and did not efficiently migrate to the non-injected femur or tibiae. In summary, the human UCB ALDH hi Lin \u2212 population includes both CD34 + and CD34 \u2212 cells capable of bone marrow homing and hematopoietic reconstitution. Therefore, isolation of CD34 \u2212 cells based on high ALDH activity may reveal a novel population of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.",
