    "abstract_text": "MLL rearranged Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) represents an unfavorable and difficult to treat type of leukemia that often is highly resistant to glucocorticoids like prednisone and dexamethasone. As the response to prednisone largely determines the clinical outcome of pediatric ALL patients, overcoming resistance to these drugs may be an important step towards improved prognosis. Here we compared gene expression profiles between prednisone-resistant and prednisone-sensitive pediatric ALL patients to obtain gene expression signatures associated with prednisone resistance for both childhood (>1 year of age) and MLL rearranged infant (<1 year of age) ALL. Merging both signatures in search for overlapping genes associated with prednisone resistance in both patient groups we, found that elevated expression of MCL-1 (an anti-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 protein family) appeared to be characteristic for both prednisone-resistant ALL samples. To validate this observation, we determined MCL-1 expression using quantitative RT-PCR in a cohort of MLL rearranged infant ALL samples (n=23), and confirm that high-level MCL-1 expression significantly confers glucocorticoid resistance both in vitro and in vivo . Finally, down-regulation of MCL-1 in prednisone resistant MLL rearranged ALL cells by RNA interference (RNAi) markedly sensitized these cells to prednisone. Therefore we conclude that MCL-1 plays an important role in glucocorticoid resistance and that MCL- 1 suppressing agents co-administered during glucocorticoid treatment may be beneficial especially for MLL rearranged infant ALL patients.",
