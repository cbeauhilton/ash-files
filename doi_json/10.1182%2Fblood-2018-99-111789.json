Methods: We retrospectively collected and analyzed 115 patients initially diagnosed wih myelodysplastic syndromes from January, 2010 to July, 2017 in West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Both bone marrow biopsy specimens and clinical data of the patients enrolled were collected. All patients were assessed prognosis by international prognostic scoring system (IPSS). We quantified the involvement of macrophage (M\u03a6), alternatively activated macrophage (M2 M\u03a6) and classic activated macrophage (M1 M\u03a6) in bone marrow specimen by staining with anti-CD68 monoclonal antibody, anti-CD163 monoclonal antibody, and anti-iNOS monoclonal antibody respectively. Log-rank test was used to evaluate the difference of overall survival (OS) among different subgroups. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of clinical parameters on patients' OS. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the independent risk factors influencing the prognosis of patients. Results: 1 In the high risk group of MDS, the composition of CD163+M\u03a6 was higher than that of the low risk group(p < 0.001). In the low risk group of MDS, the composition of iNOS+ M\u03a6 was higher than that of the group with high risk(p < 0.001). 2 The median survival time and 3-year survival rate in the high CD163+M\u03a6infiltration group were significantly lower than those in the low infiltration group (13 months vs 43 months, 27% vs 64%, Log-rank test, P<0.001). The median survival time and 3-year survival rate in high iNOS+M\u03a6 infiltration group were significantly higher than those in low infiltration group (42. 5 months vs 11 months, 65% vs 27% Log-rank test, P< 0.001). 3 According to the infiltration degree of iNOS+M\u03a6 and CD163+M\u03a6, the M1 (iNOS high /CD 163 low )and M2 TA(iNOS low /CD163 high ) M\u03a6 were further distinguished (The median OS were 53m and 15m respectively, p< 0.001). 4 In multivariate analysis, high infiltration of CD163+M\u03a6 and CD68+M\u03a6, low infiltration of iNOS+M\u03a6 and low PLT level were independent risk factors for patients' OS . Conclusion and Discuss: The degree of bone marrow TAMs subtype infiltration in MDS patients was associated with disease risk group. CD163+M \u03a6 was the main TAMs in the high risk group of MDS,while iNOS+M \u03a6 was the main TAMs in the low risk group. There was a positive correlation between the infiltration of M1-TAMs and OS. On the contrary, there was a negative correlation between the infiltration of M2-TAMs and OS. Analyzing TAMs subsets in bone marrow of patients with MDS is helpful to evaluate disease risk and prognosis.
