    "abstract_text": "Introduction Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), is an important therapeutic strategy in many hematologic malignancies. High-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation might have significant effects on cardiac functions. Cardiac functions might be effected acutely or chronically after chemotherapy. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the echocardiographic features assessed before and within the first 100 days after HSCT. Material and Method We retrospectively analyzed clinical records of patients who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation for Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma from 2005 to 2017 at Hacettepe University Section of Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit. Echocardiography was routinely performed in all patients as pre-transplant workup. Echocardiographies were performed by the cardiologists at our hospital. All measurements were made based on international standards outlined by the European College of Cardiologist (ref.). For each case, the following echocardiographic indices were measured and recorded: the left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD); the left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD); thickness of the septal and posterior walls; and the ejection fraction (EF). Results 28 patients (16 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 12 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma) who had undergone autologous hematopoetic stem cell transplantation were included. 16 patients (57%) were male and median age was 45 (range 20-68). 16 patients (57%) were given anthracyclin based therapy as conditioning regimen. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. EF significantly lower after transplantation: (61,4+/-6,3 % vs 56,9+/-12 %, p:0,03) (Figure 1). There was marginal significance in the change in EF in the anthracyclin group and no significant change in the others, when analyzed separately: EF of those treated with anthracyclin based regimens; 61,5+/-6,4% vs 55,9+/-13,9% (before vs after HSCT, p:0,06). Other patients who did not receive anthracyclin based regimens; 61,25+/-6,4 % vs 58,25+/-9,4 %, p: 0,2) Conclusion Results of the study suggest that conditioning regimens may have deleterious affects on the cardiac functions in patients with hodgkin and non-hodgkin's lymphoma who undergo hematopoetic stem cell transplantation; especially with anthracyline-based regimens.
