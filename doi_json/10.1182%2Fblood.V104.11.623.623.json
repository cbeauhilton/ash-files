    "abstract_text": "The regulated ability of the platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 to bind fibrinogen plays a crucial role in platelet aggregation and primary hemostasis. We have developed a model system based on laser tweezers that enables us to measure directly the mechanical forces needed to separate single receptor-ligand complexes. In this system, a ligand-coated bead can be trapped by the laser and repeatedly brought into contact with a receptor-coated pedestal so that the forces required to separate the two can be measured and displayed as \u201crupture force\u201d histograms. We have applied this system to the interaction of fibrinogen and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 by measuring the rupture force required to separate a laser-trapped bead coated with fibrinogen from an immobilized pedestal coated with purified \u03b1IIb\u03b23. These measurements revealed that bimolecular \u03b1IIb\u03b23-fibrinogen interactions are characterized by rupture forces ranging from 20 pN to 150 pN. We found that the yield strength of \u03b1IIb\u03b23-fibrinogen interactions was independent of the rate at which force was applied over a range of 160 to 16,000 pN/s, but the frequency of fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 during repeated contacts correlated strongly with the duration of contact between the \u03b1IIb\u03b23- and fibrinogen-coated surfaces. The observed rupture forces could be segregated into small (20\u201340 pN), intermediate (40\u201360 pN), and high (>60 pN) force regimes, each of which displayed unique kinetic behavior. Thus, the contact time needed to reach half maximal fibrinogen binding at a constant loading rate of 1,600 pN/s was ~ 1 ms for the 20\u201340 pN, 20 ms for the 40\u201360 pN, and 70 ms for the >60 pN force regimes. Increasing the surface density of immobilized fibrinogen changed the probability of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 binding to fibrinogen >3.5-fold, but did not affect the yield strength profile, implying that these measurements represent interactions between individual molecules. Each force regime also differed in its susceptibility to the inhibitory effect of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 antagonists and to the activating effect of Mn 2+ . Thus, the low molecular weight \u03b1IIb\u03b23 antagonists H12 peptide, tirofiban, and RGDS were most effective in inhibiting weak interactions, whereas the monoclonal antibodies A2A9 and abciximab were most effective in inhibiting the stronger ones. In the presence of Mn 2+ , the strongest component of the yield force distribution increased more than 2.5-fold while the moderate force component increased only 1.5-fold. In addition, rupture forces in the range of 60 to 150 pN disappeared gradually when \u03b1IIb\u03b23 preparations were stored at 4\u00b0C for 7 d, suggesting that the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 conformation corresponding to these rupture forces is labile. Taken together, these data suggest that fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is a complex, time-dependent multi-step process during which the strength of the bond between \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and fibrinogen appears to progressively increase."
