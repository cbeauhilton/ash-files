    "abstract_text": "Immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion by terminally differentiated B-cells is important in the immune response to pathogens. Its over production is a defining characteristic of many B-cell malignancies, including Waldenstr\u00f6m Macroglobulinemia (WM), where elevated IgM is associated with significant morbidity and poor prognosis. Thus, the identification and characterization of the mechanisms controlling Ig secretion are of great importance for the development of future therapeutic approaches for these diseases. Here, we define a novel pathway involving the oncogenic transcription factor, GLI2, modulating IgM secretion via regulation of IL-6 receptor alpha subunit (IL6R\u03b1) expression in WM cells. We have previously identified components of the Hedgehog (HH)-GLI pathway as modulators of Ig secretion. Pharmacological (GANT61) and genetic (shRNA) inhibition of GLI proteins resulted in no significant effect on cell proliferation or viability, while there was a significant reduction in IgM secretion (60%) in BCWM.1 (p<0.0001), (55%) in MWCL-1 (p<0.0001) and (50%) in RPCI-WM1 (p<0.0001) cells. Interestingly, this occurred independent of HH signaling as manipulation of HH had no effect on IgM secretion, cell growth or viability. Screening for a mechanism identified IL6R\u03b1 as a downstream direct target of GLI activity. GANT61 treatment significantly reduces IL6R\u03b1 promoter activity in BCWM.1 (p=0.0002), MWCL-1 (P=0.0003) and RPCI-WM1 (p<0.0001) cells. GLI2 knockdown using two independent shGLI2 constructs resulted in reduced IL6R\u03b1 mRNA expression (p<0.0001) determined by qPCR, and IL6R\u03b1 protein expression examined by FACS analysis. Similarly, GLI2 knockdown diminished IL6R\u03b1 promoter activity in BCWM.1 (p=0.0218), MWCL-1 (p=0.0008) and RPCI-WM1 (p=0.0002) cells. Using bioinformatics analysis, we identified three candidate GLI2 binding sites in the IL6R\u03b1 promoter region. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) followed by qPCR, we confirmed that GLI2 directly binds to the IL6R\u03b1 promoter region (-1294 / -1065). Finally, we were able to rescue the reduction in IgM secretion in GLI2 knockdown group by overexpressing IL6R\u03b1 (p=0.0142). Taken together, these data reveal a novel mechanism where GLI2 modulates IgM secretion in WM through the regulation of IL6R\u03b1 expression. Given the poor prognosis associated with elevated IgM in WM patients, components of this new signaling axis could be important therapeutic targets.
