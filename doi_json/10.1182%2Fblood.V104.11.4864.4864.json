    "abstract_text": "In the new staging system of multiple myeloma (MM) by South West Oncology Group (SWOG), the concentration of serum \u03b22 microglobulin (\u03b22m) and serum albumin were focused as the most important prognostic factors for survival. However, serum concentration of \u03b22m has been known as an indicator of glomerular filtration rate. The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic value of the level of \u03b22m with that of creatinine clearance (Ccr) in patients with multiple myeloma. Retrospectively, from January 1, 1996 to November 30, 2003, we reviewed 176 MM patients (M: F 110:66 mean age: 58.5\u00b111.0) whose 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance was available at the time of diagnosis. We collected clinical data such as hemoglobin, serum creatinine, calcium, albumin, \u03b22m, creatinine clearance before chemotherapies, and patients\u2019 survival time. Pretreatment \u03b22m was inversely related to Ccr (Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient = \u22120.781, P <0.01). In univariate analysis, relative risk (RR) of death was 1.047 (p< 0.001) for \u03b22m and 0.985 (p< 0.001) for Ccr. But multivariate analysis using Cox\u2019s proportional hazard model showed \u03b22m was not significant prognostic factor in patients\u2019 survival after adjustment for Ccr (RR 1.025, p=0.054) but Ccr was an independent risk factor of death after adjustment for \u03b22m (RR 0.990, p=0.013). And univariate analysis identified that RR for \u03b22m is not significant in 88 MM patients (66 patients with \u03b22m \u2265 2.5mg/l) with relatively normal renal function (Ccr \u2265 50 ml/min) (RR = 1.110, p=0.306) We could propose another new staging system with \u03b22m replaced by Ccr in SWOG staging system. The stages were defined as: stage 1, Ccr \u2265 80ml/min; stage 2, 50< Ccr <80; stage 3, Ccr < 50 and albumin \u2265 3.0g/dl; and stage 4 Ccr < 50 ml/min and albumin< 3.0 g/dl. According to this proposed staging system, median survival time of each stage from 1 to 4 is 1475, 887, 513, and 196 days, respectively. (Log Rank test < 0.0001) In conclusion, Ccr could be more important prognostic factor than the level of \u03b22m in patients of MM and we propose that Ccr should be reassessed as the component of staging system of MM."
