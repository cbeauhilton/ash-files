    "abstract_text": "Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells are a rare cell population in humans (TCR\u03b1 V\u03b124-J\u03b118) and mice (TCR\u03b1 V\u03b114-J\u03b118) that are characterized by a rapid release of immunoregulatory cytokines upon stimulation. The tolerogenic impact of host iNKT cells on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after conditioning with total lymphoid irradiation and anti-thymocyte globulin (TLI/ATG) has been shown previously (Lan et al. , BBMT 2003). Moreover, we recently described a subset of CD49b+ NKT cells overlapping with iNKT cells and providing protection from acute GVHD mainly via an IL-4-dependent mechanism (Leveson-Gower et al. , Blood 2011). Here, we investigated the role of highly purified adoptively transferred donor-derived CD4+ iNKT cells. Balb/c recipient mice were transplanted with T cell-depleted bone marrow together with 1x10 6 CD4/CD8 T lymphocytes (Tcon) from C57Bl/6 donor mice after irradiation with 8 Gy. Mice co-injected with as low as 5x10 4 freshly isolated and highly purified (>99%) CD4+ iNKT cells showed a significant survival benefit compared to mice receiving Tcon alone ( p =.0015). Consistently, weight and GVHD score improved in mice that received CD4+ iNKT cells. Signal intensity derived from expanding luciferase expressing alloreactive Tcon was significantly lower in animals treated with CD4+ iNKT cells demonstrating inhibition of proliferation of alloreactive Tcon through CD4+ iNKT cells ( p <.0001). In vivo CFSE proliferation assay confirmed decreased Tcon proliferation in peripheral lymph nodes ( p <.0001), mesenteric lymph nodes ( p =.0277) and spleen ( p =.0005). CD4+ iNKT cells showed a Th2-biased cytokine profile with high levels of IL-4 and IL-13 in the presence of alloreactive Tcon challenged with irradiated allogeneic stimulators. Co-injection of CD4+ iNKT cells that were expanded 5-fold in vitro with \u03b1-GalCer and IL-2 had the same protective effect from lethal acute GVHD compared to freshly isolated CD4+ iNKT cells (p =.7987). Interestingly, CD4+ iNKT cells derived from NKG2D -/- animals were significantly less effective in preventing acute GVHD lethality (WT vs. NKG2D -/- p =.0027). In conclusion, low numbers of highly purified freshly isolated and cultured CD4+ iNKT cells protect from lethal acute GVHD in mice and require NKG2D. Despite the fact that iNKT cells are a rare cell population, the feasibility of in vitro expansion with retained functionality of CD4+ iNKT cells provide the basis for clinical translation.
