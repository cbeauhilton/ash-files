    "abstract_text": "Large numbers of T cells bearing \u03b3d T cell receptors are present in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) target tissues. We investigated the potential role of host \u03b3d T cells during acute GVHD in a well-characterized GVHD model following full intensity conditioning (11 Gy TBI). BM and spleen T cells from BALB/c (H2 d ) donors were transplanted into wild type (wt) B6, a\u00df T cell deficient B6 (a\u00df \u2212/\u2212) or \u03b3d T cell deficient B6 (\u03b3d \u2212/\u2212) hosts. \u03b3d \u2212/\u2212 hosts demonstrated significantly better day 35 survival (85%) than wt (40%) or a\u00df\u2212/\u2212 hosts (18%) (P<0.05). Reconstitution of \u03b3d \u2212/\u2212 B6 hosts with B6 type \u03b3d T cells 24 hr prior to BMT restored lethal GVHD (50 % day 35 survival). In vivo, \u03b3d \u2212/\u2212 B6 hosts demonstrated at least a five fold reduction in donor T cell expansion and cytokine production. In vitro, T cells proliferated less when co-cultured with allogeneic \u03b3d \u2212/\u2212 dendritic cells (DCs) than with wt DCs (40,127 \u00b1 1634 vs. 72,503 \u00b1 1296, P<0.05). BM-derived DCs cultured with \u03b3d T cells caused greater proliferation of allogeneic T cells than DCs cultured with a\u00df T cells (15.1 \u00b1 21 x 10 4 vs. 5.1 \u00b1 1.2 x 10 4 , P<0.05). We next tested the effect of \u03b3d T cells on host DCs in vivo using a model system in which only the DCs injected prior to BMT expressed the alloantigen that stimulated the GVHD reaction. MHC Class II \u2212/\u2212 B6 mice that had been depleted of \u03b3d T cells were given 11 Gy TBI and injected one day prior to BMT with B6 DCs that had been co-cultured either with \u03b3d T cells or with medium. On day 0 both groups of recipient mice were injected with BM plus splenic T cells from allogeneic bm12 donors. On day +5, CD4 + donor T cells expanded four times more in recipients of DCs co-cultured with \u03b3d T cells than in recipients of control DCs and serum levels of TNF-a were significantly higher (36.7 + 6.8 vs. 21.3 + 3.7 pg/ml, P<0.05). Together these data demonstrate that \u03b3d T cells amplify the stimulatory function of host DCs and increase the severity of GVHD, suggesting that a new therapeutic target for the prevention of the major BMT toxicity."
