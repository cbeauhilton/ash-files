    "abstract_text": "Factors controlling hemoglobin F production beyond the neonatal period are poorly understood; however, unraveling the mechanisms underlying hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) could lead to therapies for \u03b2-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. We identified a non-anemic 5 year old girl with Hbs S, F, and A. Investigation revealed elevated HbF in the mother and paternal sickle trait. More than 90% of the gamma globin chains in the daughter were G\u03b3. Mother and daughter share the common -29 \u03b2 thalassemia mutation , but have normal MCVs.  . Mother . Father . Child . HbA 77.6% 54% 8.7% HbA2 3.6% 3% 2.7% HbF 18.8% 0% 32.4% HbS 0% 43% 56.2% Hemoglobin 11.4 15.3 13.3 MCV 85.7 82.4 78.2 . Mother . Father . Child . HbA 77.6% 54% 8.7% HbA2 3.6% 3% 2.7% HbF 18.8% 0% 32.4% HbS 0% 43% 56.2% Hemoglobin 11.4 15.3 13.3 MCV 85.7 82.4 78.2 View Large We set out to determine: Whether a thalassemia trait explains the MCVs in the mother and child. Whether increased HbF is due to \u03b3 globin promoter mutations linked to the \u2212 29 \u03b2 thalassemia mutation. A duplex PCR strategy was used to genotype family members for the common African \u22123.7 kb \u03b1-thalassemia deletion. Our studies show that the mother is heterozygous for the a globin \u2212 3.7 kb deletion while the father and child are homozygous for the wild type \u03b1 globin locus. The upstream region (\u2212627 to \u22125) of the G\u03b3 -globin genes of each family member were amplified and the PCR products were digested with the Xmn1 restriction enzyme to determine whether the Xmn1 polymorphism ( C\u2192T at position \u2212158) contributed to the increased fetal hemoglobin. None of the family members had this polymorphism. Sequencing of the upstream region of the G\u03b3 gene revealed that the patient is homozygous for a novel mutation (A \u2192G) at position \u2212309 for which both parents are heterozygous. In summary we describe a novel G\u03b3 gene \u2212 309 A \u2192 G mutation in association with elevated HbF; further research is in progress to determine if this polymorphism contributes to the patient\u2019s elevated fetal hemoglobin.",
