    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4396 Available manual apheresis systems generally produce stem cell yields of consistently high quality that can be safely used for autologous transplantation. However, manual apheresis needs continuous interface monitoring/adjustement, suffers from interface instability in poor mobilizers, high collection variability, high platelet loss and failure to electronically document parameters. A new advanced apheresis system, Spectra Optia v5.0, featuring optical sensors, which provide real time automatic interface and product line control, was designed to override these disadvantages. In our study, we evaluated data of 10 stem cell leukaphereses performed in 8 patients with various malignancies using Spectra Optia during 2011 to test its feasibility and effectiveness. We compared our data with those obtained from 225 patients that had undergone a stem cell collection for autologous transplantation in our Department between 2004 and 2011, using the COBE Spectra machine. The use and function of automatic interface control of Spectra were satisfactory. Due to the application of lower inlet volumes/min, as compared to corresponding volumes with the COBE Spectra machine, our apheresis with Spectra Optia usually took a longer time (median 447 min versus 317 min, p<0.005). Regarding other collection parameters, such as the percentage of CD34+ cells in the final leukapheresis product, total yield of CD34+ cells, and product volume data were comparable for both devices (0.74% versus 0.97% CD34+, p=0.103; 6.85 versus 7.1 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+/kg, p=0.752; and 403.5 versus 353 ml graft volume, p=0.094, respectively). Time to engraftment was also comparable for both apheresis devices. More specifically, time interval to neutrophil counts >500/\u03bcl, neutrophil counts >1500/\u03bcl did not significantly differ (10 days versus 9 days, p=0.386 and 11 days versus 10 days, p=0.229, respectively). However a delay in platelet recovery with Optia device need to be confirmed with additional data from apheresis procedures (median time to platelet counts >25000/\u03bcl was 12 days versus 11 days for COBE Spectra, respectively; p=0.037). Platelet loss with Optia was less than with COBE Spectra (1278 versus 2415 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcl, p=0.014). No significant differences were observed for product hematocrit between Optia and COBE Spectra (5.7% versus 6.6%, p=0.392). In conclusion, the automatic Spectra Optia aphereses were associated with similar and equally variable stem cell collections as aphereses with COBE Spectra. Further data are needed to clarify the potential benefit of lower platelet loss using Optia. We continue to use this procedure in our center and updated results will be presented in the meeting.
