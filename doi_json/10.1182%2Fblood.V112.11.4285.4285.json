    "abstract_text": "Objective F To investigate the clinical characteristics of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) and characterize the aCML. Methods F From 2003 to 2007, the consecutive samples of 54 MDS/MPD patients in Sino-US Shanghai Leukemia Cooperative Group were collected by prospective methods and diagnosed with WHO classification. We identified 9 aCML cases and analyzed the clinical and laboratory data of these cases. Results F The median age of 9 cases was 66 years old(range 38~78y). The ratio of male and female is 1:1.25. Median hemoglobin concentration was 76.5g/L(range 43.3~116), median white blood cell count 27.5\u00d710 9 /L(range 7.55 ~317.2), median neutrophil percentage 66.4%(range 43.3~83.5), median basophil percentage 2.86%(range 0.24~5.79), median monocyte percentage 7.59%(range 0.92~16.3), median platelet 77.6\u00d710 9 /L(range 20.7 ~504)and median marrow blast percentage 2.5 %(range 0.5~6). Abnormal karyotype occurred in 20% of all patients. Median survival was 11.5 months(2.5 `44months). Conclusions F aCML occurs rarely and is associated with a poor prognosis. The major distinguishing features of aCML are Ph(\u2212)or BCR/ABL(\u2212)and severe dysgranulopoiesis. In addition, hepatosplenomegaly and leukocytosis are less prominent in aCML than chronic myeloid leukemia(CML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Anemia is much severe than CML and CMML.",
