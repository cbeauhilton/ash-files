    "abstract_text": "Cardiac events, including heart failure and arrhythmias, are the major cause of death in patients with b-thalassemia. Although cardiac arrhythmias in humans are believed to result from iron overload, excluding confounding factors in the human population is difficult. The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the development of cardiac arrhythmias using the guinea pig model of secondary iron overload. Electrocardiograms were recorded via surgically implanted telemetry devices in guinea pigs loaded intraperitoneally with iron dextran and controls. Cardiac and liver iron concentrations were significantly elevated in the iron loaded animals when compared to control, and were in the range of those reported for humans with thalassemia. Arrhythmias were noted infrequently in both iron loaded and control guinea pigs. No life threatening arrhythmias were detected in either group. These data suggest that iron alone may be insufficient to cause cardiac arrhythmias, and that arrhythmias detected in individuals with iron overload may be the result of a complex interplay of factors."
