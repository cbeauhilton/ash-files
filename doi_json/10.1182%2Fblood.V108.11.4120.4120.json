    "abstract_text": "Background: The management HIT in pts. with renal and/or hepatic impairment is problematic. Of the two DTI\u2019s approved for HIT therapy in non-PCI settings, the utility of lepirudin is limited by renal impairment and argatroban is limited by hepatic impairment. In these settings, bivalirudin (BV), a hirudin analog primarily cleared by serum proteolysis and to a lesser extent, renally, has potential therapeutic advantages. Objective: To describe the clinical/laboratory features, infusion parameters, and outcomes in BV-treated HIT pts. Design: Retrospective case study. Setting: Tertiary-care medical center, IRB-approved HIT Registry. Participants: Twenty-five persons, 45\u201388 years of age with or at high-risk for HIT accrued from 2.1.03 to 4.30.06. Baseline features: HIT developed in the following pt. cohorts: open heart surgery (n=21), medical (n=3), & vascular surgery (n=1). At HIT presentation, 10 had thrombocytopenia and 3 had active thromboembolic complications (TEC\u2019s) (12 had both). The median platelet ct. was 82,500/mm 3 (60% baseline decline). A (+) test for heparin-PF4 antibodies by ELISA (GTI) or HIPA was present in 24 (96%); 1 pt. (-) by both assays had a 32% platelet decline after 5 days on UFH. Prior DTI\u2019s were administered in 11 (44%) with argatroban (n=9) or lepirudin (n=2) for a mean of 3.8 (0\u201310) days and 2.5 (1\u20134) days. Results: At BV initiation, organ dysfunction by objective criteria was present in 16 (64%) pts.: hepatic insufficiency alone (6) or failure (8; 4 with renal failure); renal insufficiency or failure alone (1 each). The mean serum creatinine, total bilirubin and AST was 1.8 (0.8\u20134.1) mg/dl, 3.74 (0.3\u201312.1) mg/dl, and 309 (25\u20131102) U/L, respectively. Nine pts. required mechanical ventilation (4 with dialysis) and 19 pts. initiated BV in an ICU setting. BV was begun at a mean IV dose of 0.21 (0.05\u20130.50) mg/kg/h, adjusted to achieve an APTT 1.5\u20132.5\u00d7 baseline, and maintained (n=24) at a mean IV dose of 0.20 (0.04\u20130.43) mg/kg/h. BV alone was continued for a mean of 8.5 (0\u201339) days. Seventeen pts. transitioned to warfarin after a mean BV overlap of 6.2 (1\u201338) days. The mean time to an initial therapeutic APTT was 15 (1.8\u201347) hours (46% with initial dose); mean dose adjustments: 1.4 (0\u20135) in 24 pts. The mean APTT and INR on BV alone was 65 sec and 1.46 (0.9\u20132.4); mean pre-BV INR: 1.27. The mean % of APTT\u2019s/pt. (range; no. of APTT\u2019s) within, below and above the therapeutic range were 60 (6\u2013100; n=235) %, 10 (0\u201341; n=58) %, and 30 (0\u201394; n=100) %. Among 10/13 pts. with platelets <100,000/mm 3 at BV initiation, the mean time to recovery \u2265100,000/mm 3 and \u2265150,000/mm 3 was 2.9 (1\u20136) days and 7.8 (3\u201318) days. Among 3/4 pts. with platelets \u2265100,000/mm 3 but <150,000/mm 3 , the mean time to recovery >150,000/mm 3 was 2.7 (2\u20134) days. New TEC\u2019s on BV developed in 3 pts. BV was discontinued in 8 pts. after a mean of 4.9 (1\u201310) days for evolving organ failure (n=4), bleeding (GI: n=2; open chest: n=1) and concern for drug half-life (n=1). Minor bleeding occurred in 3 pts. and 1 pt. required limb amputation prior to BV. Five pts. (20%) died from progressive HIT-related organ failure: 4 were off BV and received comfort care; 1 on BV with a therapeutic APTT unrelated to BV. The average length of hospitalization was 27 days (mean ICU stay: 17 days). Conclusion: In this HIT patient cohort with predominantly hepatic and/or renal dysfunction, the administration of bivalirudin was effective in achieving an 80% survival rate with an acceptable safety profile.",
