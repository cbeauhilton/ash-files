    "abstract_text": "Childhood Leukemia treatment is one of the most common malignancies seen across the globe in the pediatric age group. Severe Hemophilia A is still considered a rare bleeding disorder. Only 13 patients with hemophilia A or B have been reported in literature to also be diagnosed with acute leukemia in childhood . This rarity appeared again in a 13 year boy with severe hemophilia A who presented with worsening bone pain and joint swelling, weight loss and leukocytosis. Morphology and molecular diagnostics confirmed Acute Pre B Lymphoblastic Leukemia . The patient happens to be the first case of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in a patient with severe Hemophilia with Inhibitors. Severe hemophilia with inhibitors pose challenge in clinical management given their propensity of bleeding and poor response to traditional therapies due to a neutralizing antibody as is. Treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia requires an intensive treatment with systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy. Medications are commonly administered through a central line, in many cases an implantable catheter. Coexistence of both these life threatening disorders posed a unique practical challenge in providing standard care and our discussion aims at highlighting strategies in management of Severe Hemophilia in challenging clinical scenarios.
