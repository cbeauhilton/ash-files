    "abstract_text": "Background PI3K-delta (\u03b4) is critical for activation, proliferation and survival of B cells and plays a role in homing and retention in lymphoid tissues. PI3K\u03b4 signaling is hyperactive in many B-cell malignancies. Idelalisib (IDELA) is a potent and selective orally administered inhibitor of PI3K\u03b4 with demonstrated activity in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) CLL either as a single agent (Brown, ASCO 2013) or in combination (Barrientos et al, ASCO 2013; Coutre et al, EHA 2013; Barrientos et al, EHA 2013), and in previously untreated patients in combination with rituximab (R) (O'Brien et al, ASCO 2013). This report describes the effect of established high risk prognostic markers on the clinical activity of idelalisib based therapy in CLL patients enrolled in 3 clinical trials. Methods Subjects were enrolled into one of three trials: 1) phase 1 monotherapy dose escalation, dosing from 50 mg bid to 350 mg bid (N=54, R/R); 2) phase 1 combination with either R, ofatumumab, bendamustine \u00b1 R, fludarabine or chlorambucil\u00b1R (N= 114, R/R) ; 3) phase 2 combination with R (N=64, age\u2265 65 yrs, previously untreated). Response was assessed by investigators per IWCLL 2008. Genetic markers were assessed in a central lab using archived DNA obtained at study enrollment. Results ORR and CR results are shown in the table below, with data grouped per either R/R or previously untreated patients.  .

Thus, patients can be considered for idelalisib-based treatment in clinical trials regardless of these high-risk features. Disclosures: Coutre: Gilead Sciences: Research Funding.
