    "abstract_text": "The receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) is required for hemostasis and collagen-induced platelet aggregation. GPVI and FcR\u03b3-chain form a noncovalent signaling complex. Genetic ablation of murine FcR\u03b3-chain prevents expression of GPVI, and immunodepletion of GPVI removes FcR\u03b3 chain from platelet membranes. The GPVI/FcR\u03b3-chain relationship has confounded elucidation of the individual role(s) of GPVI and FcR\u03b3-chain in signal transduction. For example, botrocetin (bt)/von Willebrand factor (vWf) and \u03b3-thrombin induced aggregation of washed platelets each appear to be FcR\u03b3-chain-dependent. However, since FcR\u03b3-chain\u2212/\u2212 platelets also lack GPVI, the independent role(s), if any, of these signaling molecules in this aggregation could not be established. But, genetic ablation of murine GPVI does not exclude expression of the FcR\u03b3-chain. Therefore, based on analyses of genetically deficient GPVI platelets that express FcR\u03b3-chain, we demonstrate here that bt/vWf and thrombin-induced aggregation of washed platelets are each dependent on FcR\u03b3-chain thereby demonstrating that FcR\u03b3-chain can function in the absence of GPVI. Presumably, another receptor or receptors is/are able to activate FcR\u03b3-chain in GPVI \u2212/\u2212 and GPVI +/+ platelets. GPIb may not directly activate FcR\u03b3-chain because GPIb elicited activation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is not FcR\u03b3-chain dependent. The integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 appears to be common to the signaling described here because both the non-agglutination elicited bt/vWf-induced, and the \u03b3-thrombin-induced TxA2 production and ATP secretion were \u03b23-dependent. Therefore, \u03b1IIb\u03b23 may have activated this FcR\u03b3-chain-dependent signaling. This hypothesis was tested by investigating the role of FcR\u03b3-chain in \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated outside-in signaling induced by a palmitoylated derivative of the peptide KVGFFKR, a peptide which directly activates \u03b1IIb\u03b23 causing \u03b23-dependent signaling that elicits TxA2 production, ATP secretion and platelet aggregation. As with \u03b3-thrombin-treated FcR\u03b3-chain\u2212/\u2212 platelets, pKVGFFKR-treated FcR\u03b3-chain\u2212/\u2212 platelets did not produce TxA2, secrete ATP or aggregate. But, pKVGFFKR-treated GPVI\u2212/\u2212 platelets produced the wild type level of TxA2, secreted the wild type level of ATP, and aggregated normally demonstrating that pKVGFFKR-induced \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated outside-in signaling is FcR\u03b3-chain dependent. These results support the hypothesis that activation of FcR\u03b3-chain is \u03b1IIb\u03b23-dependent in the signaling described here. The results of ELISA studies support this conclusion.",
