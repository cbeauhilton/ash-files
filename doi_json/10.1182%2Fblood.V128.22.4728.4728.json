    "abstract_text": "Introduction: No method of venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk stratification exists for hospitalized cancer patients. The Khorana score is a validated tool in outpatients with cancer. The objective of this study was to assess the Khorana score for predicting development of VTE in cancer patients during admission to hospital. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data collected from healthcare records of consecutive, medically-ill cancer patients hospitalized between January and June 2010 in 3 academic medical centers in Canada. Objectively diagnosed symptomatic VTE during hospitalization, anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis (TP), and Khorana score variables were collected for every patient. Patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation at admission, and those with incomplete data were excluded. The risk of VTE based on Khorana score category was evaluated using logistic regression. Continuous data were compared using a Student's t-test and expressed using the means and standard deviations. Categorical data were compared using the Pearson Chi-square test and were expressed as percentages. Statistical significance was defined as alpha less than 0.05. Results: 1398 patients were included. Mean age was 61.6 years, 51.2% were male, and mean BMI was 25.9 kg/m 2 . The most frequent tumor types were non-small cell lung carcinoma (12.7%) followed by lymphoma (10.9%). The median length of stay was 6 days (range 0-114 days). The most frequent reasons for hospitalization were chemotherapy (22.3%) followed by pain and palliation (21.4%). 34.5% received anticoagulant TP (n = 483/1398). The incidence of VTE was 2.9% (41/1398) overall, 5.4% (9/166) in high, 3.2% (26/817) in moderate, and 1.4% (6/415) in low Khorana score risk groups. High risk patients were significantly more likely than low risk patients to have VTE (p=0.016; OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.4-11.2). There was no difference in VTE incidence between patients who received anticoagulant TP and those who did not (3.5% vs 2.6%, p = 0.345). Patients with high risk Khorana score were more likely to receive anticoagulant TP than those with low risk Khorana score (46.4% vs. 23.9%, p <0.001, OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.9-4.0). Total incidence of major bleeding was 1.8% (25/1398). There was no difference in major bleeding between patients who received anticoagulant TP and those who did not (1.7% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.787). Conclusion: The Khorana score is predictive of VTE development in cancer patients who are hospitalized for medical illness and may be a useful tool for tailoring inpatient anticoagulant prophylaxis.
