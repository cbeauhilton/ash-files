    "abstract_text": "Background: The impact of time from diagnosis to chemotherapy initiation (time to treatment, TTT) for AML has been a topic of ongoing debate. A prior study reported that TTT \u22655 days adversely impacted overall survival in younger (10 days) and older patients (>5 days). Prior data also showed no impact of TTT on early mortality. Given these conflicting findings, consensus on the impact of TTT on survival is lacking and warrants further study. Using prospectively collected population-based data, we analyzed a large cohort of adult AML patients to examine the effect of TTT on overall survival. Methods: Using data from the California Cancer Registry and Patient Discharge Dataset between 1999-2012, patients\u226515years diagnosed with de novo AML and who received inpatient treatment between 1-90 days from diagnosis were identified (n=5337). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with TTT>5 days vs 1-5 days with data presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The effect of TTT on overall and 60-day survival was estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with TTT (1-5, 6-10,>10 days)considered as a time-dependent variable. Patients were stratified by age group (<60,\u226560 years) for all analyses.Multivariable models accounted for age, race/ethnicity, sex, number of comorbidities, marital status, neighborhood socioeconomic status, health insurance type, treatment at National Cancer Institute designated (NCI) vs non-NCI designated facility, use ofleukapheresis, and year of diagnosis. Results: Of the 2659 patients 5 days increased with age in both younger and older patients. Across both age groups, patients requiringleukapheresis(age5 days. Younger (age5 days (OR 1.43, CI 1.04-1.97). Delaying chemotherapy >10 days (vs 1-5 days) adversely impacted overall survival in both age groups (age10 days (vs 1-5 days) (Table). Conclusions: In a large cohort of patients with de novo AML, TTT of up to 10 days did not have a negative impact on overall survival in patients over the age of 60. In younger patients (5 days was associated with decreased overall survival. Delaying chemotherapy over 5 days adversely impacted 60-day survival in both age groups. Our observation that patients were more likely to have a shorter TTT at non-NCI designated hospitals may relate to delays associated with transfer to or clinical trial enrollment at NCI centers. Our results suggest that waiting to get results of ancillary testing, such as cytogenetic and molecular mutation analyses, in order to inform treatment decisions for AML patients, may be feasible in some patients with AML. In an era of rapidly evolving prognostic and treatment landscapes for AML, our findings may have implications for personalized therapy, including novel targeted therapies, and clinical trial design for patients withAML.
