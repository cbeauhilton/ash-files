    "abstract_text": "Natural sources of radiation in space include galactic cosmic rays (GCR), solar energetic particles (SPE) and trapped energetic particles in a planetary magnetic field. These different sources of space radiation consist of protons of various energies, particle nuclei of high energy and charge (HZE) and neutrons of different energies. These sources are difficult to shield because of their high energies and dense ionization patterns, thus posing significant health risks to astronauts on long term inter-planetary missions. Efforts to protect astronauts from harmful cosmic radiation require a deeper understanding of the effects of GCR on human health. In particular, very little is known about the effects of GCR exposure on the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population and whether disruptions in genetic stability in HSCs could result in the development of hematopoietic malignancies in astronauts on deep space missions. The average age of shuttle crew has risen above 46 years, and our work and others have shown that HSCs display diminished function with age. Recent data from our group has demonstrated that middle-aged individuals show frequent defects in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in HSCs. MMR corrects DNA mismatches generated by DNA polymerase during replication which prevents mutations from becoming permanent in dividing cells. Thus, MMR plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response pathway to prevent short-term mutagenesis and long-term tumorigenesis. Several human MMR proteins have been identified as MutS and MutL homologues consisting of MSH2 and MLH1 heterodimers that functions in DNA mismatch/damage recognition, endonuclease activity and termination of mismatch-provoked excision. Our group has shown that humans accumulate microsatellite instability (MSI) with acquired loss of MLH1 protein in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as a function of age. Therefore, we employed a DNA mismatch repair deficient mouse model (MLH1 +/- and MLH1 -/- ) to study the effects of different radiation sources including 56 Fe, 28 Si, 4 He, 1 H and \u1d5e-rays on HSCs to examine HSCs of potential astronaut population under GCR conditions. The complete blood count (CBC) data after 5 months and 9 months of whole body irradiation with different ions showed a slight dose-dependent decrease in all blood counts but absence of any significant difference in CBC of MLH1 +/+ vs MLH1 +/- mice. In addition, CFU and competitive repopulation data demonstrated a radiation quality effects on HSC function, but not an MLH1 effect. These results demonstrate that hematopoietic stem cell function is normal and that a MLH1 defect does not differentiate progenitor and mature effector cells following HZE radiation. To study long term effects of different ions on the potential for disease progression in a MLH1 dependent manner, we performed whole body irradiation with 56 Fe, 28 Si, 1 H and \u1d5e-rays on MLH1 +/+ and MLH1 +/- mice and followed them up to 18 months post exposure. We observed that MLH1 +/- mice show dramatic increases in lymphomagenesis 10-12 months after 56 Fe irradiation compared to wild type mice, with greater than 60 % of MLH1 +/- mice developed lymphomas at doses 10 cGy and 100 cGy compared to less than 10 % of wild type. For comparison, roughly 10 % of MLH1 +/- mice developed lymphomas when mice were treated with whole body sparsely ionizing \u1d5e-rays at 100 cGy compared to none of the control. Thus the date show that MMR defects in HSCs lead to sensitization to radiation induced hematopoietic malignancy and that radiation quality effects exacerbate the sensitivity. The findings could have profound effects on astronaut screening, as well as lead to important questions regarding safety of ion therapy and development of second malignancies for cancer patients who remain on Earth.
