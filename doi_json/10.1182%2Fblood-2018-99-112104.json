    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) is a rare cell population that sits atop a hierarchy of progenitors that become progressively restricted to several or a single blood lineage. HSCs are capable of self-renewal and multipotent differentiation to all blood cell lineages. HSCs are crucial in the maintenance of lifelong production of all blood cells. HSCs are highly regulated to maintain homeostasis through a delicate balance between quiescence, self-renewal and differentiation. However, this balance is altered during the hematopoietic recovery after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). HSCT is routinely used to reconstitute hematopoiesis after myeloablation, being the most commonly-used cell therapy. HSCT efficacy and multilineage reconstitution can be limited by inadequate HSC number, poor homing, engraftment, or limited self-renewal. Recent evidence indicates that estrogens are involved in regulating the hematopoietic system homeostasis. Estrogens are the primary female sex hormones and are responsible for controlling many cellular processes including growth, differentiation and function of the reproductive system. However, estrogens have also been proposed to regulate HSCs. b-Estradiol (E2) was shown to promote the cell cycle of HSCs and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) and increase erythroid differentiation in females ( 1 ). On the other hand, tamoxifen reduces the number of MPPs and short-term HSCs but activates proliferation of long-term HSCs ( 2 ). The potential clinical application of estrogens in HSCT mainly derives from the possibility that these drugs may enhance the engraftment of transplanted HSCs, thus reducing side effects associated to myeloablative conditioning. Here, we show that a short-term treatment of immunodeficient mice transplanted with hCD34 + cells with estrogens such as E2 and estetrol (E4) improves human hematopoietic engraftment. Fifty-thousand cord blood CD34 + cells (CB-CD34 + ) were transplanted into sublethally irradiated immunodeficient NSG mice. Three days after transplantation, mice were treated for four days with daily subcutaneous doses of E2, E4 or vehicle. Human hematopoietic engraftment was evaluated in the BM of transplanted mice at four months later. E2 and E4 estrogens increased the proportion of hCD45+ cells 1.8-fold and 2.4-fold as compared to values determined in control mice, without modifying the proportion of myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Significantly, animals treated with either estrogen had significantly higher levels of human hematopoietic progenitors (hCD45 + CD34 + ). To study the engraftment of long-term engraftment HSCs in transplanted mice, human CD45 + cells from primary recipients were sorted and transplanted in secondary NSG recipients. Three months after transplants, the proportion of human hematopoietic cells in secondary recipients was also higher when primary recipients were treated with E2 or E4 than in vehicle-treated animals. Improved engraftments associated to the administration of E2 or E4 estrogens were confirmed when very low doses of CB-CD34 + cells were transplanted (5x10 3 hCD34 + /mouse) in recipients of either sex. Collectively, our data support a new application of estrogens to improve the hematopoietic recovery after HSCT. This application may have particular relevance to enhance the hematopoietic recovery after myeloablative conditioning and when limiting numbers of HSCs are available.
