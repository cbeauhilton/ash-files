    "abstract_text": "Platelets play an important role in the processes of hemostasis and thrombosis. Platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mediates bi-directional signaling during these processes. Agonist-dependent activation of integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 through inside-out signaling results in high-affinity binding of soluble ligands, such as fibrinogen. Fibrinogen binding induces a cascade of signaling through the integrin, termed outside-in signaling that results in platelet aggregation and clot retraction. Previously, we have characterized CIB1, a calcium- and integrin-binding protein that specifically interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of \u03b1IIb. Previous reports using in vitro and ex vivo studies implicated that CIB1 is involved in maintaining \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in its resting state, agonist-induced activation of the integrin, and outside-in signaling resulting in platelet spreading. Here, we show that platelet filopodia formation induced by fibrinogen binding to integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 needs Ca2+, but is independent of the Ca2+-dependent interaction of CIB1 with \u03b1IIb. Additionally, dynamic rearrangement of the cytoskeleton is required for the recruitment of FAK to the CIB1-\u03b1IIb complex at the filopodia and FAK activation. Moreover, disruption of the association of CIB1 and \u03b1IIb by incorporation of \u03b1IIb peptide or CIB1 antibody inhibited FAK activation. Furthermore, Cib1 null platelets acquired a spiky morphology and failed to fully spread on immobilized fibrinogen. Interestingly, FAK activation was significantly reduced in Cib1 null platelets exposed to immobilized fibrinogen. Our results suggest that during outside-in signaling, a rise in the intracellular Ca2+ level and filopodia formation occurs prior to the interaction of CIB1 with \u03b1IIb. Additionally, Ca2+ bound CIB1 recruits FAK to the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 complex at the filopodia, where FAK is activated, resulting in platelet spreading. Thus, our results have provided a mechanism through which CIB1 regulates outside-in signaling through integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23.",
