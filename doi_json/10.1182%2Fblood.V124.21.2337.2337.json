    "abstract_text": "Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is a key regulator of cell growth and survival. We have previously reported the pro-survival role of TGF-\u03b21 and the anti-leukemic efficacy of TGF-\u03b2 neutralizing antibody in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment ( Xu et al., Br J Haematol.2008, Tabe et al. PLoS One. 2013) . FLI-1 is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of extracellular matrix genes under negative regulation by TGF-\u03b21\u2013dependent acetylation. We reported that patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) expressing a low level of FLI-1 achieved high rates of remission, but their remission duration and survival were curtailed (Kornblau et al., Blood, 2011) . Moreover, treatment with rhTGF-\u03b21 induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 ( MMP-1 ) mRNA in AML cells, which inversely correlated with FLI-1 expression (Tabe et al. ASH 2012) , concordant with a previous report that FLI-1 downregulates the expression of MMP-1 promoter activity. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which TGF-\u03b2 induces AML cell survival. In AML cell lines NB4, U937, and OCI-AML3, rhTGF-\u03b21 (2ng/mL) induced the TGF-\u03b2 downstream targets plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 , mRNA) and Smad2 phosphorylation (p-Smad2). These effects were reversed by anti\u2013TGF-\u03b2 neutralizing antibody 1D11 but not by the isotype control antibody 13C4. Treatment with rhTGF-\u03b21 significantly inhibited serum starvation\u2013induced apoptosis and promoted G 0 /G 1 cell cycle arrest in NB4 and U937 cells but not in OCI-AML3 cells (subG 1 % vs controls at 72 h: NB4, 18.9 \u00b1 1.7 vs 12.8 \u00b1 1.3; U937, 51.9 \u00b1 2.8 vs 29.1 \u00b1 2.4; OCI-AML3, 8.8 \u00b1 0.5 vs 7.7 \u00b1 0.5; G 0 /G 1 % vs controls at 72 h: , NB4, 39.2 \u00b1 3.5 vs 55.6 \u00b1 5.6; U937, 16.0 \u00b1 1.8 vs 37.6 \u00b1 2.1; OCI-AML3, 68.0 \u00b1 4.2 vs 55.1 \u00b1 9.9). These changes were effectively reversed by 1D11, indicating that rhTGF-\u03b21 facilitated pro-survival effects along with transition into a quiescent G 0 state in NB4 and U937 cells but not in OCI-AML3 cells. To investigate the differences in TGF-\u03b2 downstream signaling activation in these cells, we focused on ERK phosphorylation and FLI-1 expression. TGF-\u03b2 is known to activate ERK downstream of the Ras pathway, which cross-talks with Smad signaling and associates with FLI-1 activation. In U937 and NB4 cells, after rhTGF-\u03b21 treatment, ERK phosphorylation was upregulated in the early phase (0.5-3 h) and then downregulated (24 h), and FLI-1 expression was downregulated (mRNA and protein, 24 h). Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a modulator of TGF-\u03b2 and a negative regulator of p-ERK, was downregulated by rhTGF-\u03b21. ERK is known to participate in multiple feedback loops that include its upstream regulator Ras, which is important for the reduction of ERK activity at a late stage after stimulation. Indeed, p-Raf, a direct upstream regulator of p-ERK, demonstrated concordant expression changes with p-ERK after rhTGF-\u03b21 treatment. No changes in p-ERK and FLI-1 expression were detected in OCI-AML3 cells. rhTGF-\u03b21 induced significant upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in NB4 and U937 but not in OCI-AML3 cells. We next investigated the rhTGF-\u03b21\u2013induced expression of CD44 and its variant CD44v. CD44 is recognized as a marker of cancer stem cells, and CD44v regulates redox status in stem-like cancer cells. In several types of cancer cells, CD44 is known to mediate cell migration via interaction with TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor and close association with ERK signaling. Treatment with rhTGF-\u03b21 increased both total and variant CD44 mRNA in NB4 cells but caused no change in OCI-AML cells (fold change of CD44 / CD44v mRNA compared to controls: NB4, 3.0/3.7; OCI-AML3, 1.2/0.9). These changes were inversely correlated with FLI-1 expression in NB4 cells. Taken together, these results show that TGF-\u03b2\u2013induced ERK activation and its subsequent negative feedback on the Ras/Raf pathway are associated with FLI-1 downregulation and other responses, including CD44 upregulation, in AML in a cell-dependent manner ( Figure 1 ). These molecular changes might contribute to maintenance of the stem cell\u2013like properties, support survival of AML cells, and play pathologic roles in the TGF-\u03b2\u2013abundant BM microenvironment.
