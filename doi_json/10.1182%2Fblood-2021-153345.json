    "abstract_text": "Background: In a previous study, we reported the strong expression of Inducible T-cell costimulatory (ICOS) by S\u00e9zary cells, and presented the excellent preclinical efficacy results of anti-ICOS antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) in both S\u00e9zary syndrome (SS) and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Although exerting a potent direct action on the tumor cell, ADCs have the disadvantage of being associated with a cumulative toxicity, related to the conjugated drug. The development of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity/phagocytosis (ADCC/ADCP)-inducing anti-ICOS monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is therefore of great importance to ensure long-term maintenance therapy. Methods: We first determined which anti-ICOS clone was the best candidate to induce an ADCC effect on ICOS + cell lines (MyLa, MJ and HUT78), using Mouse Fc\u03b3RIII ADCC Bioassay (Promega\u00ae). The selected mAb was then chimerized and afucosylated (GlymaxX\u00ae technology, Evitria\u00ae). Secondly, we evaluated in vitro ADCC and ADCP effect of the chimeric anti-ICOS mAb against ICOS + CTCL cell lines, compared to both positive controls (mogamulizumab (moga) and alemtuzumab) and negative controls (IgG1 isotype control, and rituximab). To perform ADCC experiments, we co-incubated target cells with mAbs and allogenic NK lymphocytes from healthy volunteers (HV). Cellular apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using the Caspase 3/7 assay (Promega\u00ae). For ADCP, monocytes were sorted from HV blood samples and treated with M-CSF. Target cells were labeled with PKH67 (Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae) and after co-incubation, CD14 + CD11b + PKH67 + monocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Finally, we verified the ADCC/ADCP potency of anti-ICOS mAbs on primary S\u00e9zary cells isolated from 16 moga-na\u00efve SS patients, and 6 patients who had developed resistance to moga. We also questioned whether anti-ICOS mAbs were able to promote the autologous apoptosis of S\u00e9zary cells and T regulatory cells (Tregs) when directly incubated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with SS. Results: Among 7 different anti-ICOS clones, 314.8, 92.17 and 293.1 clones had the higher ADCC activity against MyLa, MJ and HUT78. Of these 3 clones, 314.8 had the best affinity to the receptor, and the best ability to inhibit binding between ICOS receptor and a recombinant ICOS ligand protein. Anti-ICOS 314.8 mAb was then chosen to be chimerized and glyco-engineered. ICOS and CCR4 were strong and similarly expressed on MyLa and MJ. HUT78 had only mild expression of ICOS and CD52. Anti-ICOS mediated potent ADCC of cell lines (respectively 39.1\u00b15% and 52.6\u00b12.4% for MyLa and MJ cells), without significant difference when compared to mogamulizumab. In HUT78 cells, anti-ICOS induced a specific apoptosis of 35.7\u00b15% versus 15.6\u00b15.6% with alemtuzumab ( p =0.02; CI95%: 4.1-36.1). Moreover, phagocytosis induced by anti-ICOS was significantly increased than that induced by negative controls. On MyLa cells, anti-ICOS had a greater phagocytosis activity than moga (59.4\u00b15.2% vs 39.4\u00b15.1%, p =0.031). Expression of ICOS by circulating tumor cells was found in all the 16 moga-na\u00efve patients. The expression was strong, as 61\u00b16% of tumor cells expressed ICOS vs 20\u00b18% of non-tumoral CD4 + cells. CCR4 was more expressed than ICOS on both S\u00e9zary cells and non-tumoral CD4 + cells (91\u00b16%, and 44\u00b19% respectively). Anti-ICOS induced the apoptosis of 57.1\u00b14.7% S\u00e9zary cells, compared to 16.9\u00b12.2% with rituximab ( p <0.01; CI95%:-53--27). The efficacy was better than with alemtuzumab, but there was no significant difference with moga. The ADCP effect induced by anti-ICOS did not differ with moga. Interestingly, anti-ICOS were effective in 6 moga-resistant patient, as they induced 38.9\u00b15.9% of apoptosis, compared to 12.4\u00b14.7% with moga ( p <0.001). Ex vivo , anti-ICOS allowed 39.4\u00b119.9% and 70.1\u00b120.1% lysis of S\u00e9zary cells and Tregs respectively, with no difference with moga and alemtuzumab. However, the depletion of non-tumoral CD4 + and total PBMCs was significantly lower with anti-ICOS mAbs than with moga and alemtuzumab. Discussion: In a recent study, we showed that Treg cells of patients with SS have a high expression of ICOS. Here, we demonstrate that anti-ICOS mAbs induce Tregs depletion, which may improve immune profiles and emphasize S\u00e9zary cells killing. Our data suggest robust anti-tumor activity of anti-ICOS mAbs in SS, and xenograft experiments are underway to confirm these findings.
