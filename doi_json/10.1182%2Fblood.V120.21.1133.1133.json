    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1133 Introduction: Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. VWD and other autosomal inherited bleeding disorders equally affect women and men. Menorrhagia or severe menstrual bleeding (HMB) is the most common symptom of women with bleeding disorders. HMB is defined as bleeding that lasts for more than seven days or as the loss of more than 80 mL of blood per menstrual cycle. The menstrual blood loss can be quantified by the use of a pictorial bleeding assessement chart (PBAC). Samples and methods: In 195 women with menorrhagia and in 45 controls menstrual blood loss was quantified using pictorial blood assesment charts (PBAC) and results were compared. Results: In 169 of 195 women (86%) a bleeding disorder could be detected. In those with a bleeding disorder, the distribution was as followed: 62% had a von Willebrand disease, 14,4% had a factor-VII-deficiency (F7D), 5% had a factor-XIII-deficiency (F13D) and the remaining 18,6% had other beedling disorders (e. g. hypofibrinogenaemia and other mild factor deficiencies). The median PBAC-Score of all patients was 268 (range: 10\u20134212). In our controi group of 45 women the median PBAC-Score was 46,5 (3- 137).ROC-Analysation shows that the PBAC (AUC=0.977) is much more useful than the number of bleeding days (AUC=0.855) in order to distingish controls from patients suffering from menorrhagia due to a coagulation disorder. We found that the best cutoff for the PBAC is 100 with an sensitifity of 88% and a specifity of 97%. Discussion: Attempts to measure the quantity of menstrual blood loss can be useful in clinic practice. One study found that variables predicting a blood loss higher than 80ml per menses were clots greater than one inch, low ferritin levels, or changing a pad or tampon more than hourly (flooding). A prospective method of quantifying menstrual blood loss includes the use of a pictorial bleeding assessement calendar (PBAC). We are of the opinion, that we would have detected more bleeding disorder also in the patients, where we did not find any diagnosis until now, if we would have controlled them more than one time during the cycle period. Conclusions: Women with hyermenorrhagia frequently suffer from a bleeding disorder, in 86% of our patients an abnormal coagulation was found. The PBAC-Score is an easy tool to quantify menstrual blood loss in women. In our study a PBAC-Score above 100 was suspicious of having a bleeding disorder. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
