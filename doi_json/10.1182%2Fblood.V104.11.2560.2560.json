    "abstract_text": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), encoded by the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, is one of the most common autosomal dominant genetic disorders. Neurofibromin, the protein product of NF1 , functions as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for p21 Ras (Ras); however, its specific GAP activity towards the different Ras isoforms is not fully understood. We have previously established that Nf1 haploinsufficiency alters mast cell fates both in vitro and in vivo , and modulates the recruitment of mast cells to Nf1-/ - Schwann cells, the tumor initiating cell type in neurofibromas (Yang, JCI 2003). We have also found high expression of both K-ras and N-ras , but undetectable levels of H-ras , in mast cells. We examined the role of Nf1 as a GAP for K-ras utilizing fetal liver-derived mast cells. Consistent with previous studies, haploinsufficency of Nf1 results in a two-fold increase in proliferation of mast cells associated with an increase in ERK activity as compared to WT controls. However, genetic inactivation of K-ras rescues the proliferative gain in function of Nf1 +/ \u2212 mast cells, associated with lower biochemical activation of ERK as compared to WT levels. Additionally, utilizing Boyden chamber assays, as well as videomicroscopy, Nf1 +/ \u2212 mast cells exhibits increased migration to kit-L, while genetic inactivation of K-ras abrogates this gain in function. Further, degranulation in response to crosslinking the high affinity Fc receptor on the surface of mast cells is markedly reduced in Nf1+/ \u2212 ; K-ras-/- cells as compared to Nf1 +/ \u2212 mast cells. A key gain in function observed in Nf1+/ \u2212 and Nf1 -/- hematopoietic cells is increased survival associated with an increase in PI3-K activity. While H-ras has been shown to differentially activate the PI3-K pathway compared to K-ras in other cell systems, we have found that genetic inactivation of K-ras reduces Akt activity, a sensitive measure of PI3-K activity, in Nf1+/ \u2212 mast cells. This decrease in activity is associated with a two- to three-fold reduction in survival as compared to Nf1 +/ \u2212 mast cells and is comparable to WT mast cells. Additionally, an intermediate in vitro phenotype is observed in cells that are heterozygous at both the Nf1 and K-ras loci ( Nf1 +/ \u2212 ; K-ras +/ \u2212). To evaluate the interaction between Nf1 and K-ras in vivo , two model systems were utilized. Since K-ras-/- embryos die in utero , adult K-ras heterozygotes were utilized to examine the in vivo mast cell response to kit-L using microsmotic pumps placed subcutaneously in the dorsal side of the animals. Consistent with previous studies, Nf1 +/ \u2212 mice have increased mast cell numbers in response to kit-L as compared to WT controls. However, genetic disruption of a single allele of K-ras restores mast cell numbers to WT levels. As a second model system, we are currently evaluating the role of genetic disruption of both alleles of K-ras in mast cells in vivo by adoptively transferring hematopoietic cells of the respective genotypes into lethally irradiated mice that are genetically deficient in the c-kit receptor and lack mast cells (W/Wv mice). Collectively, these findings suggest that Nf1 acts as a GAP for K-ras in mast cells and that K-ras is integral to a range of mast cell functions. Further, these data suggest that K-ras may be a useful molecular target for the treatment of neurofibromas as well as other disorders that involve mast cells in disease pathogenesis."
