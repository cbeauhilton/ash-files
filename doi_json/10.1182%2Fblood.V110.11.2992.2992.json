    "abstract_text": "Background: Viral infections are the leading cause of non-relapse mortality after unrelated umbilical cord blood transplants (UCBT). Post-transplant lymphopenia, lack of established antiviral memory, and lack of cytotoxic function among infused UCB lymphocytes are jointly responsible for ineffective immunity. We have previously demonstrated ex vivo T cell expansion and maturation starting from a very small fraction (10%) has hindered T cell expansion. We hypothesized that the presence of cytokines essential for T cell homeostasis, in particular IL-7 may aid expansion and survival, beads with different densities of CD3/CD28 antibodies may impact UCB T cell expansion. Research Design: From frozen/thawed specimens we tested 2 different sources of CD3/CD28 artificial beads (historical control beads vs ClinExVivo\u00ae, (Invitrogen Corporation), \u00b1 IL-7. Methods: Thawed UCB samples were centrifuged over Ficoll gradient. T cells were positively selected with EasySep\u00ae, (StemCell Technologies) and were incubated in gas permeable bags with CD3/CD28 beads in 5% serum replete media + 100u/ml IL-2 \u00b1 10ng/ml of IL7. Media & cytokines were replenished to maintain a concentration of \u223c0.75 \u00d710 6 cells/ ml. Automated cell count, trypan blue viability assessed overall cell growth and viability at each feeding . \u2018Lyse no wash\u2019 FACS staining with Trucount\u00ae beads quantified viable CD3+ T cells. 4-color FACS was employed to characterize the evolution of surface and intracellular immunophenotype. Cytotoxicity profile of the day 0 and D12-14 progeny was tested by Europium release assay (Delfia\u00ae assay) against a Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma cell line (IM9). Two-tailed paired Student t-tests analyzed the impact of the experimental variables. Results: At the end of 12\u201314 day expansion periods, analyzing all cytokine conditions, we could demonstrate an average of 43-fold viable CD3+ T cell expansion using control APC beads (n=8), while T cells on ClinExVivo\u00ae beads expanded on average 94-fold ( p=0.11, n=11) . Addition of IL7 to the culture media afforded significantly better expansion with the control bead condition (mean 43 vs 26 fold, p=0.02 ). IL7 also enhanced T cell expansion with ClinExVivo\u00ae beads (mean 147 fold vs 49 fold, though statistically NS). There were significantly more viable T cells generated with ClinExVivo\u00ae beads when all timepoints were analyzed, irrespective of the absence ( p=0.017 ) or presence ( p=0.05 ) of IL7. We also analyzed the mechanism how IL7 may potentiate overall T cell expansion. T cells entering cell cycle was enhanced (though not significantly) as demonstrated with intracellular Ki-67 staining (65% T cells in cycle with IL7 versus 52% without, p=0.2 ). IL7\u2019s overall salutary effect on total expansion may be best explained by simultaneously reduced T cell apoptosis as quantified by activated ic Caspase-3 detection (9.3% versus 7.6% without vs with IL7, respectively, p=0.08 ) regardless of the source of beads. Granzyme A, B, perforin expression was enhanced comparably, while cytotoxicity was absent against IM9 cells regardless of \u00b1 IL-7. Conclusions: These results demonstrate significant expansion of UCB T cell that is further improved by utilizing ClinExVivo\u00ae clinical grade APC beads and IL7. These results pave the way to donor-derived UCB T cell expansion suitable for DLI to boost immunity."
