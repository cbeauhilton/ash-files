    "abstract_text": "Objective s: To exam the outcomes of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated on Berlin-Frankf\u00fcrt-M\u00fcnster (BFM) International ALL- based protocol, GD 2008ALL protocol. Method s : In total, 274 patients with newly diagnosed ALL age 1 to 16 years were enrolled onto GD2008ALL protocol from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2016. Five-year overall survival (OS) rates and even-free survival (EFS) rates were examined with additional analyses of causes of relapse and death. Results: The 5-year probabilities of OS and EFS were 90.8% and 86.9%. The 5-year EFS were 91.7% in SR group, 86.5% in IR group and 82.6% in HR group, respectively. Twenty-five patients were died. Reasons for mortality included 8 cases due to relapse of leukemia, seven cases due to severe infection, one case due to hepatic failure, one case due to intracranial hemorrhage from accident, eight cases abandoned after relapse. There were 29 cases relapsed, including 22 cases (75%) relapsed of the bone marrow alone, 1 case (3.6%) CNS relapsed alone, 2 cases (7.1%) testicular relapsed and 4 cases (14.3%) relapsed of bone marrow and extramedullary. Eleven patients survived after therapy for relapse, of which 7 had received HSCT, two out of the 7 had relapsed after HSCT, and continued on CART therapy. Four out of the 11 relapsed patients received relapsed ALLR3 protocol for treatment. All 11 patients remained in remission status. Conclusion: Our single institutional review of pediatric ALL treated on GD 2008ALL Protocol was tolerated and has good long term outcomes. Although relapse is a major factor affecting long term survival, there are still have options such as HSCT or immunotherapy available for these patients.
