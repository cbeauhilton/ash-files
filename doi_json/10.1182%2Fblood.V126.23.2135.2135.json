    "abstract_text": "Cushing's disease (CD) is a rare endocrine disorder (1.2-2.4/million/year) characterized by chronic excess endogenous glucocorticoids (GC) due to an adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. Untreated CD results in increased mortality and multiple morbidities (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease) and, in one case report, erythrocytosis (Gursoy et al, J End Invest . 2006;29:742). The effects of chronic GC exposure on erythropoiesis in a CD cohort have not yet been studied. We prospectively quantified hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb) and platelets (ptl) values in CD patients before ( v1 ) and after surgical remission ( v2 , mean time since surgery=14.5 months) and in matched healthy controls ( HC ). Frequency, antigenic profiling and erythroid (Ery) expansion potential of circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) in the three cohorts were also evaluated. The subjects analyzed included 28 v1 [6 males, 22 females, mean age=41 years; body mass index (BMI)=33.3 kg/m 2 ] and 13 HC [2 males, 11 females, mean age=41 years; BMI=30.7 kg/m 2 (range 26.7-34.7, p=0.073). Eleven patients were analyzed over time in both v1 and v2 . Mean cortisol in v1 (22.2\u00b16.3 ug/dL) was higher than in HC (8.5\u00b13.8 ug/dL, p=3.4E-07) and decreased in v2 (17.6\u00b15.1% vs. 8.7\u00b13.9%, N= 11, p=0.0006). Hct was higher in v1 than in HC (39.8\u00b14.7%, vs. 38.8\u00b12.7%, p = 0.045). In the 11 patients analyzed over time, hct decreased in v2 vs. v1 (39.2\u00b14.7% vs. 42.3\u00b14.4%, p=0.011). Hb in v1 was not different than in HC (13.10\u00b11.6 vs. 13.12\u00b13.8 g/dL, p =0.225) but decreased in patients studied both in v1 and V2 (14.1\u00b11.5 g/dL vs. 13.2\u00b11.8 g/dL, p=0.009). Similarly, plts were not different in v1 and HC (272.3\u00b181.4 vs. 240.8\u00b176.0 K/uL, p=0.274) but decreased in v2 (307.7\u00b1112.1 vs. 270.6\u00b174.5 K/uL, p=0.021). In v1 , Hct did not correlate with serum (R = 0.34, p = 0.33) or 24h urine (R = 0.072, p = 0.73) cortisol concentrations. There was no difference in frequency of HPC among v1 , v2 and HC [2.6\u00b13.0, 0.34\u00b10.28 and 1.26\u00b10.67% of CD34 + cells and 30.2\u00b127.2, 23.7\u00b113.2 and 16.5\u00b111.5 CFC/10 5 mononuclear cells (MNC) in v1 , v2 and HC ]. CD34 pos cells from all groups expressed similar levels of cKIT, IL-3R\u03b2 and prominin1, but a greater proportion of those from v1 and v2 expressed thrombospondin and thrombopoietin (Mpl) receptors than those from HC (2 vs 0.4%), suggesting that CD HPC are biased toward erythro-megakaryocytopoiesis. Consistently, in cultures without the synthetic GC dexamethasone (Dex), MNC from v1 (12\u00b16 %) and v2 (19%) generated in 10 days a greater proportion of Erys than MNC from HC (2\u00b11% ). However, in cultures with Dex, MNC from v1 (48\u00b125), but not those from v2 (70\u00b123), generated less Erys than MNC from HC (83\u00b126 , p=0.03), suggesting that Erys from v1 HPC respond poorly to Dex. This was tested by comparing the ability of Dex to induce biochemical (GR\u03b1 phosphorylation at S211 and cell-surface expression of CXCR4/calreticulin) and biological (proliferation in synergy with growth factors, GFs) responses in Erys from CD and HC . Erys from v1, v2 and HC expressed equivalent levels of GR\u03b1 but those from v1 Erys contained lower levels of pGR\u03b1S211/S203 than those from v2 or HC ( Fig 1A ). In contrast with HC Erys, Dex decreased GR\u03b1 and did not induce pGR\u03b1S211 in v1 Erys ( Fig 1B ). Moreover, Dex increased cell-surface expression of CXCR4 (MFI from 580 to 700) and calreticulin (MFI from 300 to 700) and proliferation (by 30%) in HC Erys but not in those from v1 s (CXCR4 MFI from 278 to 154, calreticulin MFI from 136 to 152; proliferation increases by 6%). These results indicate that chronic GC excess increases Hct values but may also activate a post-transcriptional mechanism that reduces GR\u03b1 expression inducing desensitization of erythroid cells to GC.
