    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3849 Poster Board III-785 Introduction The first-in-class proteasome inhibitor VELCADE\u0308 (bortezomib) is a critical component of chemotherapeutic strategy in treating multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell malignancy characterized by monoclonal gammopathy and osteolytic lesions. However, patients eventually develop bortezomib resistance, highlighting the continuous challenge to further improve myeloma therapy. We have recently identified a novel proteasome inhibitor MLN9708 that shows greater antitumor activity than bortezomib in a number of preclinical xenograft models. Here we describe antitumor activity of MLN9708 in a genetically engineered mouse model of human MM. In this model, neoplastic plasma cell development is driven by deregulated expression of Myc (c- myc , myelocytomatosis oncogene) and Bcl-x (official gene name: Bcl2l1 ; encodes the anti-apoptotic Bcl-X L oncoprotein). This is the first preclinical in vivo study of proteasome inhibitors employing a transgenic mouse model of human MM in which plasma cell neoplasms develop de novo . Materials Upon exposure to aqueous solutions or plasma, MLN9708 immediately hydrolyzes to MLN2238, the biologically active form. MLN2238 was used for all preclinical studies described below. Methods We have previously demonstrated that intercrossing C57BL/6 mice carrying the iMyc Ca transgene (insertion of Myc in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus, Igh ) with FVB/N mice carrying the 3'KE-Bcl-X L transgene (enforced expression of Bcl-x driven by the immunoglobulin light-chain 3' k enhancer and Vk21 promoter) produces double transgenic F1 hybrid iMyc Ca /Bcl-X L mice that develop plasma cell malignances with short onset (135 days on average) and full penetrance (100% tumor incidence; J. Clin. Invest. 113:1763-1773, 2004). These double transgenic iMyc Ca /Bcl-X L mice develop hypergammaglobulinemia and tissue plasmacytosis by 6-8 weeks of age and rapidly succumb to malignant plasma cell tumors by less than 200 days of age. Preliminary studies based on 11 tumor-bearing iMyc Ca /Bcl-X L mice showed this form of plasma cell malignancy recapitulates important features of human MM, including serum paraproteins, infiltration of bone marrow with malignant plasma cells, osteolytic lesions and myeloma-like global gene expression profiles ( Cancer Res. 67:4069-4078, 2007). Here we used the iMyc Ca /Bcl-X L mouse model of human MM to assess the antitumor activity of bortezomib and MLN9708 in a preclinical setting. Results Untreated double transgenic iMyc Ca /Bcl-X L mice (n=30) invariably developed plasma cell tumors with short onset (median tumor-free survival = 112 days) and showed marked elevations in plasma immunoglobulin IgM, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b levels. To assess antitumor activity of bortezomib and MLN2238, 9-week-old iMyc Ca /Bcl-X L mice were treated intravenously (IV) twice per week (BIW) with bortezomib (1.2 mg/kg) or MLN2238 (18 mg/kg) for 6 consecutive weeks. These doses represent the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for each drug as previously determined in normal C57BL/6 x FVB/N F1 hybrid mice. Treatment of iMyc Ca /Bcl-X L mice with bortezomib (n=30) significantly prolonged tumor-free survival compared to untreated controls (median tumor-fee survival = 139 days; hazard ratio = 0.116; 95% CI = 0.057 to 0.235; p <0.0001). Importantly, treatment of iMyc Ca /Bcl-X L mice with MLN2238 (n=30) also significantly prolonged tumor-free survival relative to untreated controls (median tumor-free survival = 148 days; hazard ratio = 0.144; 95% CI = 0.071 to 0.289; p <0.0001). Immunoglobulin levels, overall tumor burden, osteolytic lesions (mCT) and biochemical parameters of myeloma bone disease after treatment with bortezomib and MLN2238 will be presented. Conclusion The novel proteasome inhibitor MLN9708 demonstrates striking antitumor activity in a genetically engineered mouse model of human MM, significantly prolonging tumor-free survival of double transgenic iMyc Ca /Bcl-X L mice. MLN9708 is currently in human clinical development for both hematological and solid tumor indications. Disclosures: Janz: Millennium \u2013 The Takeda Oncology Company: Research Funding.
