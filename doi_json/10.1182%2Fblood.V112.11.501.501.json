    "abstract_text": "Resistance to apoptosis is a hallmark of leukemia, representing a major therapeutic obstacle. We previously showed that CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1) and its AML mutants inhibit apoptosis in hematopoietic cells dependent upon induction of bcl-2 in cooperation with NF-\u03baB p50. We now identify the genes encoding mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic bcl-2 member and FLIP, an inhibitor of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, as additional direct genetic targets of the C/EBP\u03b1:NF-\u03baB complex. In particular, C/EBP\u03b1 binds to the BCL2, FLIP or MCL1 promoters, as detected by ChIP assay in both Ba/F3 cells and normal murine marrow or spleen cells. In contrast, C/EBP\u03b1 does not bind to the promoters of these genes in marrow or spleen cells obtained from nfkb1 (\u2212/\u2212) mice that lack NF-\u03baB p50. In addition, induction of C/EBP\u03b1 from the zinc-responsive MT promoter in Ba/F3 cells leads to induction of BCL2, FLIP, and MCL1 mRNAs. Furthermore, C/EBP\u03b1(\u0394K312), an AML derived leucine zipper (LZ) mutant that does not bind DNA but can interact with NF-\u03baB p50, retains the ability to localize to the BCL2, FLIP , and MCL1 promoters and to induce their corresponding mRNAs. The promoters for each of these genes also bind endogenous NF-\u03baB p50 as assessed by ChIP assay. We previously demonstrated that the ability of C/EBP\u03b1 to block the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and protect cells from radiation- or cytokine withdrawal-induced apoptosis is dependent upon induction of bcl-2. We now show that in C/EBP\u03b1 transgenic splenocytes bcl-2 protein is induced only in the presence of NF-\u03baB p50. As expected from the induction of FLIP by C/EBP\u03b1, we now also find that transgenic C/EBP\u03b1 protects wild-type but not nfkb1 (\u2212/\u2212) splenocytes from apoptosis induced by FasL activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. In addition, we now demonstrate direct interaction of C/EBP\u03b1 with NF-\u03baB p50 using highly purified proteins isolated from E. coli . Together these data indicate that BCL2, MCL1, or FLIP are induced cooperatively by C/EBP\u03b1 or C/EBP\u03b1(\u0394K312) proteins that tether to the corresponding promoters via bound NF-\u03baB p50. Additionally, we found that C/EBP\u03b1 or C/EBP\u03b1(\u0394K312) bind to the nfkb1 promoter and induce its mRNA expression. Conversely, we also demonstrate that immature, lineage-negative marrow cells isolated from nfkb1 (\u2212/\u2212) mice have an approximately 3-fold reduced level of C/EBP\u03b1 and that NF-\u03baB p50 binds the endogenous CEBPA promoter in normal murine marrow cells in the ChIP assay, indicating cross-regulation and a potential positive feedback loop between C/EBP\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB p50. Indeed, induction of exogenous C/EBP\u03b1 in Ba/F3 cells increases nuclear localization of NF-\u03baB as assessed by gel shift assay. In summary, C/EBP\u03b1 and its AML mutants interact directly with NF-\u03baB p50 via their basic regions; through binding to a DNA \u03baB site the complex activates several anti-apoptotic genes including BCL2 , MCL1 and FLIP , thereby inhibiting both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. In addition, through positive feedback NF-\u03baB p50 induces C/EBP\u03b1 expression, and C/EBP\u03b1 induces NF-\u03baB p50. These effects are retained by the C/EBP\u03b1 AML mutants and do not depend on DNA binding, contributing to NF-\u03baB deregulation in malignant blasts. As C/EBP\u03b1 or mutant C/EBP\u03b1 variants and activated NF-\u03baB are commonly expressed together in AML stem cells, targeting the C/EBP\u03b1:NF-\u03baB p50 interaction with small molecules may provide a novel therapeutic approach to this and other malignancies.",
