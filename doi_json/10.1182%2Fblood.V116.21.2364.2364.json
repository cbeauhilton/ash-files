    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2364 Allogeneic HCT using nonmyeloablative regimens may provide long-term remission in high-risk relapsed CLL. Here, we investigated the impact of histology, disease status, lymph node (LN) size, genomic aberrations, donor type, and prior alemtuzumab on outcomes. Pts (n=136) were conditioned with 2Gy TBI alone (12%) or 2Gy TBI plus 90 mg/m 2 fludarabine (88%). Median age was 56 (range 42\u201372) years and median number of prior regimens was 4. Ninety percent of pts had fludarabine-refractory CLL. Incidences of grades II, III, and IV acute GVHD were 39%, 14%, and 2% respectively, and chronic extensive GVHD was 51%. Complete (CR) and partial remissions (PR) were seen in 55% and 15% of pts, respectively. Estimated 5-years rates of non-relapse mortality (NRM), progression/relapse, OS, and progression-free survival (PFS) were 32%, 36%, 41%, and 32%, respectively. Overall, 58 pts are alive; 45 in CR, 5 in PR, 5 with stable disease, and 3 with progression (PD)/relapse. Univariate outcomes ( Table 1 ) were not statistically significantly different between donor types for NRM ( p =0.37), relapse ( p =0.17), or PFS ( p =0.88). Pts with CLL and SLL had comparable rates of relapse and PFS. Disease status at HCT had no impact on NRM ( p =0.75), relapse ( p =0.31), or PFS ( p =0.27). Relapse ( p =0.51) and PFS ( p =0.45) were not statistically significantly different among the 6 groups of cytogenetic abnormalities ( Table 1 ). Both alemtuzumab within 12 months before HCT (53% vs. 31%, p =0.007, Figure ) and LN size \u22655 cm (59% vs. 28%, p =0.003) were associated with increased rates of relapse. In Cox regression model for outcomes, prior alemtuzumab (HR: 2.20, p =0.02) and LN size \u22655 cm (HR: 2.21, p =0.02) were independently associated with increased relapse; while donor type, cytogenetic abnormalities, and disease status were not. PFS was also worse for pts with prior alemtuzumab (HR: 1.55, p =0.09) and LN size \u22655 cm (HR: 1.64, p =0.06). In multivariate models, pts who had alemtuzumab within 3 months prior to HCT appeared to have the highest relapse risk ( Table 2 ). Prior alemtuzumab had no impact on CD3 donor chimerism following HCT. Further studies are warranted to explore whether the negative impact of alemtuzumab on relapse was due to unrecognized high-risk disease features or hampering the quality of graft-versus-tumor effects such as by deletion of host dendritic cells (Blood. 2002; 99: 2586). Allogeneic nonmyeloablative HCT is associated with graft-versus-leukemia effects even against chemo-refractory and high cytogenetic-risk diseases. We currently are studying novel approaches to better debulk disease before HCT and/or to augment graft-versus-leukemia effects after HCT for CLL pts with large LN size.
