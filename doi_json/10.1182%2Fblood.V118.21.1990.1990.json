    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1990 Introduction: Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a standard of care for younger multiple myeloma patients (pts). However, nearly all pts undergoing ASCT will relapse and require salvage therapy. Several investigators have reported 2 nd ASCT might be a feasible and effective treatment modality in some pts. However, these studies contained small number of pts with 2 nd ASCT and did not compare with outcomes of salvage therapy using novel agents. Thus, the aims of this study are to investigate outcomes of 2 nd ASCT in pts relapsed after front-line ASCT and identify the impact of 2 nd ASCT compared to modern systemic therapy in the novel agent era. To minimize the heterogeneity between the 2 groups, matched-pair design was chosen. Methods: The data of 48 pts between 1998 and 2010 with 2 nd ASCT after relapse of front-line ASCT identified from web-based registry ( www.myeloma.or.kr ) were analyzed. Pts with tandem ASCT or salvage allo-SCT were excluded. The goal of this study was to perform a matched-pair analysis, each patient with 2 nd ASCT was matched to three pts from a cohort of 517 pts treated with systemic chemotherapy after relapse of prior ASCT. The pts were matched for 9 potential prognostic factors: age at relapse (MEL140), response to front-line ASCT (\u2265VGPR vs <VGPR), and time to progression (TTP) since first ASCT (<18months vs \u226518months). At least 8 of these factors should be matched between the four matched pts. Finally, 48 pts with 2 nd ASCT were matched to 144 pts with systemic chemotherapy. Results: The median age at relapse was 55.5 (range, 33.4\u201368.5) years and 106 pts (55%) were male. The ISS was I(54, 28%)/II(84, 44%)/III(54, 28%). Serum LDH level was elevated in 133 (69%) and sCr \u22652mg/dL was in 35 (18%). The data of conventional cytogenetic analysis was available in 156 pts (79%). Thirty-three (21%) were abnormal. Of these, 26 pts (79%) had complex chromosomal abnormalities, 15 (45%) del(13q), and 6 (18%) hypodiploidy. One hundred sixty (83%) received VAD as induction therapy for first ASCT. Conditioning regimen for first ASCT was MEL 140\u2013200 mg/m 2 in 187 (97%). Fifty-six (29%) received maintenance therapy after first ASCT. Response to front-line ASCT was 67 CR (35%), 39 VGPR (20%), 68 PR (35%), 13 MR/SD (7%), 5 PD (3%). The median TTP after first ASCT was 12.0 (range, 1.1\u201383.8) months, and pts with \u226518 months of TTP after first ASCT were 57 (30%). After matching process, we identified it was successful because the distribution of 9 matching variables and unmatched other variables (ECOG performance status, hypercalcemia, bone lesions) was balanced between 2 groups. 2 nd ASCT conditioning consisted of MEL alone in 45 (94%), the remaining 3 had MEL with busulfan or bortezomib. Only one transplant-related death occurred following 2 nd ASCT. Novel agents used as salvage therapy in their course of disease were bortezomib in 151 (79%), thalidomide in 138 (72%), and lenalidomide in 6 (3%). Thalidomide was less frequently used in the 2 nd ASCT group than the systemic chemotherapy group (58% vs 80%, p=0.016). With a median follow-up of 55.3 (range, 3.4\u2013140.0) months, the 2 nd ASCT group revealed significantly better progression-free survival (median, 18.0 [95% CI, 15.2\u201320.8] months vs 9.1 [6.7-11.5] months, p=0.017, respectively) and overall survival (OS; median, 55.5 [46.2-64.8] months vs 25.4 [16.7-34.1] months, p=0.035, respectively) than the systemic chemotherapy group. In multivariate analysis for OS, <18 months of TTP after first ASCT (HR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.49\u20135.14), ISS III (HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.09\u20133.82), and salvage systemic chemotherapy (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.09\u20133.22) were independent prognostic factors for worse OS. Conclusion: The outcomes of salvage 2 nd ASCT appear superior to those of systemic chemotherapy, even fewer pts in the 2 nd ASCT group received thalidomide. Additionally, 2 nd ASCT was an independent prognostic factor for better OS. Considering current low mortality of 2 nd ASCT, our results might provide a substantial evidence for performing 2 nd ASCT in relapsed myeloma pts and suggest the value of performing a prospective randomized trial comparing 2 nd ASCT and systemic chemotherapy in pts relapsed after front-line ASCT.
