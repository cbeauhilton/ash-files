    "abstract_text": "Background: Romidepsin is a bicyclic peptide that inhibits Class I and II HDACs. Piekarz et al noted responses to romidepsin in CTCL (ASCO, 2004). This pivotal phase II study sought to confirm the activity. Methods: This single arm, open label study enrolled CTCL (Stages 1B\u20131VA), including MF and Se\u0301zary syndrome (SS) patients (pts) from \u223c40 sites in Europe, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia and the US. Pts with biopsy-proven CTCL (centrally reviewed) who failed \u22651 prior systemic therapy received romidepsin at 14 mg/m2 as a 4-hour IV infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 q 28 days for up to 6 cycles but could continue if deriving benefit. Eligibility criteria included adequate organ function and ECOG PS \u2264 1. Exclusions included significant CV abnormality or treatment with QTc-prolonging or CYP3A4-inhibiting drugs. The primary endpoint is response rate measured by a combination of imaging, circulating malignant T-cell counts and a weighted scoring instrument to determine skin involvement (confirmed by photography). Target accrual of 64 evaluable pts (i.e. received 2 courses) has been reached and the study will close. Results: 92 pts were eligible with 68 evaluable for efficacy per protocol. Responses in evaluable pts are 1 CR, 3 CCRs, 20 PRs, 40 SD and 4 PD for an ORR of 35% (duration 2\u201321 months). Of pts who received \u22651 dose, the ORR is 26% (24/92) but includes 5 too early to be assessed. Median time to response is 8 weeks (range 4 \u2013 20). Responses by stage at entry in evaluable pts, as available: Stage IB-IIA 7/23 (30%); Stage IIB-IVA 15/37 (41%). In pts with pruritus at baseline i.e. score of \u2265 30 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), relief of \u2265 30 mm from baseline or a VAS score of 0 (no itching) for at least 2 cycles, was seen in 18/38 pts (47%). In those pts with severe pruritus (VAS score \u226570 mm), 14/24 (58%) experienced relief of itching. Adverse event (AE) data are available for 75 pts. AEs were reported in 54/75 (72%) of dosed pts but Grade (G) 3/4 events in only 12/75 (16%). Most frequent AEs are nausea/vomiting (G2) fatigue (G2/3), myelosuppression (G2/3), and asymptomatic ECG changes (transient mild QTc prolongation and nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities). Thirteen pts withdrew due to AEs but there were no treatment-related deaths although 4 pts died of PD and 1 from right ventricular failure. Serious AEs considered possibly, probably or likely related to treatment were reported in 12 pts. Of these, 8 had \u2265G3 events: tumor lysis, cardiac tamponade, sepsis, constipation, oral candidiasis, dermatitis, hyperglycemia/vomiting/nausea and bradyarrhythmia/atrial fibrillation. Conclusions: This study confirms the efficacy of romidepsin in treatment-refractory CTCL including relief of pruritus and an encouraging response rate with 4 CCR (1 pathology-confirmed). The low rate of discontinuation due to AEs and prolonged treatment duration of some patients illustrate that toxicity has been manageable."
