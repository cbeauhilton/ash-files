    "abstract_text": "Introduction : High total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) measured on 18F-FDG PET/CT before R-CHOP has been shown to be significantly associated with worse progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; Cottereau et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2016;22:3801-9) . The REMARC study (NCT01122472) is an international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized phase III trial that assessed lenalidomide (LEN) maintenance therapy versus placebo (PBO) in 650 patients responding to R-CHOP. With a median follow-up of ~40 months, independent review demonstrated that 2 years of LEN maintenance therapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS); median was not reached in the LEN arm vs 58.9 months in the PBO arm (HR=0.71 [95% CI, 0.54-0.93]; p=0.0135; Thieblemont et al. J Clin Oncol. 2017;35:2473-81). Methods: For these analyses, patients enrolled in the REMARC trial who had baseline PET/CT before R-CHOP (not mandatory per study protocol) with available fused images and end of treatment PET/CT were included. Total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV, defined as the sum of the regions of the local tumors with FDG uptake) was measured on baseline PET/CT with the 41% SUV max thresholding method using the free semiautomatic software Beth Israel Fiji20 (http://petctviewer.org). The optimal TMTV cut-off to PFS (per FDA censoring rule) and overall survival (OS) was determined by Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) curves and X-tile analyses. Survival was estimated using Kaplan Meier (KM) curves. Multivariable analysis were performed with descending Cox model including TMTV, IPIaa, treatment arm and PET/CT response evaluated by Deauville criteria. Analyses were performed on the evaluable population and separate arms Results: 228 of 650 REMARC patients had TMTV data available for analysis, including n=108 in the PBO arm and n=120 in the LEN arm. Clinical characteristics were similar to the overall population. The median baseline TMTV was 295 cm3 (Q1-Q3, 99-702). After a median follow-up of 51.6 mo, 4y-PFS was 73% and 4y-OS was 85%. The optimal TMTV cut-off determined by ROC was 300 cm 3 for PFS and OS. Patients with TMTV >300 vs \u2264300 cm3 presented with worse ECOG performance status (ECOG \u22652: 19% vs 9%, p=0.034), higher Ann Arbor stage (stage III-IV: 95% vs 86%, p=0.042), more extra-nodal sites (>1: 65% vs 38%, p<0.001), more frequently elevated LDH (76% vs 43%, p<0.001), higher IPI (IPI 3-5: 87% vs 51%, p<0.001), and higher aaIPI (aaIPI 2-3: 76% vs 34%, p<0.001). In all evaluated patients, a significant impact of TMTV for cut-offs of >300 vs \u2264300 cm3 was observed for PFS (HR=2.09; 95% CI, 1.22-3.69) and OS (HR=2.99; 95% CI, 1.44-6.18). Patients with high TMTV >300 cm3 vs low TMTV \u2264300 cm3, respectively, had a 4-year PFS of 57% vs 73% and OS of 70% vs 88%. These results were more disparate when a higher TMTV cut-off of >1000 was applied. In multivariate analysis, only TMTV maintained an independent prognostic value. The prognostic impact of TMTV >300 vs \u2264300 cm3 on PFS (HR=2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.22) and OS (HR=5.0; 95% CI, 1.4-17.) was maintained in the PBO arm (Figure 1A). In contrast, when the analysis was focused on patients in LEN arm, TMTV >300 vs \u2264300 cm3 lost its prognostic impact on PFS and OS. In the LEN arm, 4-year PFS and OS did not differ significantly between patients with high and low TMTV (Figure 1B). Conclusion: TMTV measured on baseline PET/CT is a strong prognosticator of outcome in DLBCL, even in patients in response after R-CHOP. High TMTV at baseline was significantly associated with worse PFS and OS in patients receiving PBO following a response to R-CHOP in the REMARC study. Interestingly, LEN maintenance reduces the negative impact of high baseline TMTV on survival in patients with DLBCL View large Download slide View large Download slide  Close modal Disclosures Casasnovas: takeda: Consultancy; merck: Consultancy; MSD: Consultancy; Roche: Consultancy; Gilead Sciences: Research Funding; Roche: Honoraria; Takeda: Honoraria; Merck: Honoraria; Gilead Sciences: Honoraria; Janssen: Honoraria; Celgene: Honoraria; MSD: Honoraria; Roche: Research Funding; Gilead Sciences: Consultancy; Janssen: Consultancy.
