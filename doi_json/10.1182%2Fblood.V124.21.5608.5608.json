    "abstract_text": "Introduction The hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine (AZA) has been the standard of care for higher risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) for the last few years. Its efficacy has been proven in large clinical trials, and its safety has been shown to be superior to that of conventional treatments. We have conducted a retrospective study about the efficacy and safety of 5-azacytidine, as reported and analyzed in our center. Patients and Methods Forty four consecutive patients with MDS or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) with 20-30% bone marrow blasts that were treated with AZA during the last 63 months were included in the study. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients were recorded, and the efficacy and safety data were analyzed. Results The epidemiologic and hematologic characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. The median overall survival was 13 months (1-101) and there was no primary treatment failure (Table 2). Serious adverse events consisted mostly of neutropenic infections (blood stream and pneumonia) (Table 3). Discussion Treatment with AZA offered a favorable (complete and partial) response in 34.1% of the patients, and an overall survival of 13 months, with generally predictable toxicities, although hospitalization was frequently inevitable during the first treatment cycles, when supportive treatment was a significant part of the management. A valuable observation is that there was a considerable decrease in the patients\u2019 transfusion needs following treatment (p<0.0001). Our results are consistent with the results of other clinical trials and point out the need for investigational 5-azacytidine combinations. Table 1. Epidemiologic and hematologic characteristics.
