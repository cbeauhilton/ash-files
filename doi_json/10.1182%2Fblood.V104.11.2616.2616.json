    "abstract_text": "Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and venous thrombosis. In animal models, hyperhomocysteinemia produces endothelial dysfunction due to decreased bioavailability of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). Because NO has antithrombotic properties, we tested the hypothesis that hyperhomocysteinemia accelerates photochemically-induced carotid artery thrombosis induced in mice. Mice heterozygous for a targeted disruption of the cystathionine \u03b2-synthase ( Cbs ) gene ( Cbs +/\u2212) and wild type littermates ( Cbs +/+) were fed either a control diet or a high methionine/low folate (HM/LF) diet for 8 months. Plasma total homocysteine was elevated by the HM/LF diet compared with the control diet in both Cbs +/+ (11.6\u00b11.2 vs. 3.7\u00b10.5 \u03bcmol/L; p<0.05) and Cbs +/\u2212 mice (26.4\u00b13.8 vs. 6.2\u00b10.6 \u03bcmol/L; p<0.001). The time to stable occlusion after photochemical injury (rose bengal and green laser) of the carotid artery was 50% shorter in mice fed the HM/HF diet (17.5\u00b12.3 and 18.2\u00b14.0 minutes for Cbs+/+ and Cbs+/ \u2212 mice, respectively) compared with mice fed the control diet (44.0\u00b19.1 and 31.4\u00b14.7 minutes for Cbs+/+ and Cbs +/\u2212 mice, respectively; p<0.001). Using the oxidative dye, dihydroethidium (DHE), increased production of superoxide was detected in Cbs+/+ and Cbs+/ \u2212 mice fed the HF/HM diet compared with the control diet. To determine whether lack of endothelium-derived NO may accelerate carotid artery thrombosis, mice deficient in endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( Nos3 \u2212/ \u2212) were also studied. Time to occlusion did not differ between Nos3 \u2212/ \u2212 mice and wild type mice (55.0\u00b110.2 vs. 42.1\u00b17.1 minutes, p=0.31). We conclude that hyperhomcysteinemia increases susceptibility to experimental thrombosis through a mechanism that is independent of endothelium-derived NO, but may involve oxidative stress."
