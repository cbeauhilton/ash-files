    "abstract_text": "In multiple myeloma, the neoplastic plasma cells are either dispersed throughout the red marrow spaces of the axial and proximal appendicular skeleton or concentrated in discrete, well vascularlized plasmacytomas that stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption and erode into cortical bone. Interactions between bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and myeloma cells are clearly important in the pathogenesis of myeloma that diffusely infiltrates the bone marrow and where plasmacytomas are in contact with the bone marrow space. However, these interactions cannot be of major relevance at the centers of expanding plasmacytomas since these sites are devoid of osteoclasts, osteoblasts and other BMSC. Histological sections of skeletal plasmacytomas from 22 patients with multiple myeloma were therefore examined after immunostaining with anti-macrophage antibodies. Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections showed sheets of plasma cells interspersed with numerous small blood vessels. Immunostained sections revealed abundant CD68+, CD163+ macrophage infiltrates in all tumors, and scattered collections of CD3+ T lymphocytes. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) accounted for 2 to 12 percent of nucleated cells in these plasmacytomas and were evenly distributed through the parenchyma or clustered around CD34+ blood vessels. In general the TAM had dendritic morphology, and each dendrite was in close contact with multiple plasma cells. In a small percentage of cases, there was a subpopulation of TAM strikingly clustered around CD34+ positive blood vessels. However, vascular mimicry was not seen. Abundant murine CD68+ TAM were also found in subcutaneous KAS6/1 and MM1 myeloma xenografts in SCID mice. To determine whether cells of the monocytic lineage might be exploitable as carriers for systemic delivery of therapeutic agents to plasmacytomas, monocyte-derived dendritic cells were infected with oncolytic measles viruses and administered intravenously to SCID mice bearing subcutaneous KAS6/1 xenografts. Immunostaining for human MHC II antigen revealed that the infused DCs could localize to the KAS6/1 tumors where they heterofused with and transferred MV infection to the myeloma cells. This is the first report of TAM in skeletal plasmacytomas of myeloma patients. Further research into the role of TAM in supporting myeloma growth is warranted since they may offer many potential opportunities for the development of novel approaches to myeloma therapy.",
