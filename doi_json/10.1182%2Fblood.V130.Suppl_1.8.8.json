    "abstract_text": "Several members of the Ras-GTPases have been shown to play major roles as molecular switches in various signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells. The roles of Ras/MAPKs/ERK signaling pathways in EPO-induced erythroid differentiation have been explored in the past on animal models. Recently, the Ras/RalGEFs/Ral pathway has been a focus of research in oncology given its roles in tumorigenesis. However, its role in normal human erythropoiesis is poorly understood. The seven RalGEF family members are guanine nucleotide exchange factors with unique as well as overlapping roles. They bridge activated Ras to activation of RalA and RalB while they have also been shown to promote Akt activation. Recently, we identified and characterized a homozygous splicing variant (c.1580+4T>A) in RGL2 (Ral Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Stimulator-Like 2) gene, one of the RalGEFs, in a 16 month-old female patient with a recessive form of familial syndromic pancytopenia, more severe in the erythroid lineage with transfusion-dependent anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, liver fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction. We verified by RT-PCR that this splicing variant was associated by a decrease in the RGL2 expression levels by 70-96% in the white blood cells and reticulocytes of the patient. We hypothesized that decreased RGL2 expression leads to defective human erythropoiesis by altering terminal erythroid differentiation, erythroblast cell cycle progression and/or apoptosis. To test our hypothesis, we transduced human bone marrow derived CD34+ cells (donated by healthy volunteers under an IRB-approved research protocol in our institution) with lentivirus encoding shRNA targeting RGL2 mRNA and then cultured them in a previously validated 3-phase culture system that recapitulates erythropoiesis ex vivo. A scrambled shRNA sequence was used as control. The efficiency of the shRNAs used to knock-down (KD) RGL2 expression was initially validated by qRT-PCR after transduction of K562 cells. Our study demonstrated that knockdown of RGL2 expression resulted in decreased erythroid cell growth in ex vivo erythropoiesis accompanied by increased apoptosis. We further showed that knockdown of RGL2 expression also led to delayed terminal erythroid differentiation by flow cytometric analysis using glycophorin A (GPA), band 3, and \u03b14-integrin as markers of maturing erythroblasts. This finding was corroborated by morphology studies using Wright staining in cytospins from RGL2-KD cultures and control. Together, our studies indicate an essential role for RGL2 and the Ras/RGL2/Ral pathway in human erythropoiesis, affecting both terminal erythroid differentiation and apoptosis. Our findings not only provide insights into regulation of normal erythropoiesis but also indicate that RGL2 may be a novel candidate gene associated with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes.
