    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2741 Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the best and most successful disease model for tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The mechanism of BCR-ABL leading transformation and signaling transduction networks have been intensively characterized over decades. However, resistance to TKIs remains a challenge in management of patients with CML. A better understanding BCR-ABL signaling network will lead to a better therapy. Here we report the discovery of a novel downstream target of BCR-ABL signalling, PRL-3 ( PTP4A3 ), an oncogenic tyrosine phosphatase. Analysis of CML cancer cell lines and CML patient samples reveals the upregulation of PRL-3. A search of Gene Expression Atlas ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/gene/ENSG00000184489 ) identified the expression level of PRL-3 was highest in CML among 950 human cancer cell lines crossing 32 different types of cancers (Dataset code: E-MTAB-37), suggesting a potential role of PRL-3 in CML pathogenesis. Inhibition of BCR-ABL signalling either by Imatinib or by RNAi silencing BRC-ABL in CML cell line K562, KCL-22 and primary patient samples reduces PRL-3, in parallel with suppression of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway activities and increased cleavage of PARP, a hallmark of apoptosis. In contrast, the amount of PRL-3 protein remains constant or even increased in response to Imatinib treatment in drug resistant cells expressing BaF3-P210 T315I. Finally, analysis with specific shRNA demonstrated K562-shPRL-3 (shP) cells proliferated as much as 2-time lesser than K562-shControl (shC) at day 8 (p < 0.001). Colony-forming efficiency is an indicator of self-renewal capacity of leukemic cell. K562-shP cells also showed significantly impaired colony generating capacity by 3-fold compared to K562-shC (p < 0.001). These results indicate a critical role for PRL-3 in CML cell expansion and self-renewal. In summary, the present study demonstrates that PRL-3 is remarkably upregulated in human CML cell lines, BCR-ABL transformed cell lines and primary CML patient samples. Our results highlight that PRL-3 is a novel downstream target of BCR-ABL pathway, which is crucial for BRC-ABL-mediated cell survival and self-renewal. These data support a functionally important role of PRL-3 in CML biology downstream of BCR-ABL and maybe a viable therapeutic target in BCR-ABL positive cells even in those with Imatinib resistant mutations.
