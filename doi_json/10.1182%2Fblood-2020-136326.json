    "abstract_text": "Objective: To explore the significance of the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes (NLR), monocytes to lymphocytes (MLR), and platelets to lymphocytes (PLR) in the prognosis of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data for 60 multiple myeloma patients who were diagnosed in Jiangning Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University from August 2011 to March 2020. According to NLR\u3001MLR\u3001PLR, the patients were divided into the low NLR group (NLR<3.61) or high NLR group (NLR\u22653.61), low MLR group (MLR<0.33) or high MLR group (MLR \u22650.33), low PLR group (PLR< 129.78) and high PLR group (PLR \u2265129.78). Overall survival time (OS) was used as the prognostic evaluation criteria, and Kaplan-Meier survival curve, Log-rank test and Cox regression model were used to carry out univariate and multivariate analysis on clinical and laboratory parameters. Results: Among the 60 patients, 33 were male and 27 were female, the median age of onset was 65 years old, 19 were in the high NLR group, 41 were in the low NLR group, 24 were in the high MLR group, 36 were in the low MLR group, 26 were in the high PLR group, and 34 were in the low PLR group. The univariate analysis showed the prognosis was influenced by factors including NLR, PLR, age, ISS stages, hemoglobin (HGB), albumin (ALT). MLR, type of immunoglobulin, white globulin ratio (A/G), gender, \u03b22-microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine were not correlated with the total survival time of patients. The multivariate analysis showed that ISS III stages, PLR\u2265129.78\u3001HGB<100g/L were independent risk factors influencing the prognosis of MM patients. Conclusion: ISS III stages, PLR\u2265129.78\u3001HGB<100g/L are independent prognostic risk factors in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, which can be used as an economical and effective method for early evaluation of patient prognosis.
