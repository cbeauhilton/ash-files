    "abstract_text": "Objective: To study the pathology transform of liver, spleen, intestinal tract and skin with acute graft-versus-host disease after myeloablative MHC mismatched BMT in mice. Methods: The murine model of MHC mismatched BMT was established by using (BALB/c H-2d mouse as the recipient, and C57BL/6 H-2b mouse as the donor. 30 recipient mouse were divided into 3 groups (n=10) after irradiation (TBI 60 Co 9.0Gy). simple-irradiation group, MHC mismatched GVHD group: the BALB/c H-2d mice were conditioned with 9.0Gy, after a interval of four hours followed by infusion of C57BL/6 H-2b mice bone marrow cells (1\u00d710 7 /one) and spleen cells (3\u00d710 7 /one). syngeneic BMT group: C57BL/6 H-2b mice were conditioned with 9.0Gy, after a interval of four hours followed by infusion of C57BL/6 H-2b mice bone marrow cells (1\u00d710 7 /one). The effect was assessed by hemotopoietic reconstruction, survival time, body weight, histopathology in the recipients. Rasults: Life span: survival time was (5.23\u00b10.78) days for the simple-irradiation group, survival time was (14.67\u00b12.34)days for MHC mismatched GVHD group, beyond 30 days for syngeneic BMT group. Pathology results: GVHD pathology manifestation were found in MHC mismatched GVHD group. The severity of GVHD pathology transform in mice were based on the occurrence time of GVHD. The GVHD pathology transform of liver, spleen, intestinal tract and skin in the same mouse were not parallel which GVHD pathology transform of spleen was the severest, the nest were intestinal tract and skin, GVHD pathology transform of liver was the trivial, even more normal. 3 of 10 in GVHD group had skin III-IV GVHD, but normal liver. Conclusion: The result have shown that the onset time of liver GVHD in four organs was the last in myeloablative MHC mismatched BMT in mice.",
