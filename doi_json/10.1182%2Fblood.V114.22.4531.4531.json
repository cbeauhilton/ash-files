    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4531 Introduction According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database 12,810 patients will be diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 2009 with an incidence rate of 3.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States. The SEER data estimates that 55% of those diagnosed are 65 years or older. Standard first line therapy for the treatment of AML consists of at least one round of chemotherapy commonly referred to as induction. A significant portion of those patients who receive standard induction chemotherapy will have leukemia that fails to show a complete response as defined by less than 5% leukemia blasts in the bone marrow with normal tri-lineage hematopoiesis and peripheral blood count recovery (Mueller S, et al. BMC Cancer 2006, 6:143). Age, patient performance status, the presence of secondary AML, cytogenetics, and molecular markers are prognostic for particular cohorts of patients, however, there is currently no means to predict whether an individual's leukemia will or will not undergo a complete response (CR) after the administration of standard AML induction chemotherapy. Methods A budget impact model was designed to assess the incremental societal cost and incremental cost to a typical national health plan of treating patients who will fail induction therapy. The analysis only evaluated elderly patients over the age of sixty five. Data were gathered from the peer reviewed literature. All costs have been updated to 2009 dollars using the medical care component of the consumer price index. The patient population was determined to be 6,981 patients in 2009 with 30% receiving induction therapy (Menzin J, et al. Arch Intern Med. 2002; 162:1597-1603) and only 38% demonstrating a CR (Appelbaum FR, et al. Blood 2006 107:3481-5) resulting in 1,303 patients failing during induction therapy. The costs were taken from Menzin et al., which used Medicare claims data to determine the associated costs of AML patients during the first two years post diagnosis. In the model Medicare payments are used as a proxy for direct costs to society and a national health plan. These reimbursements are able to capture the costs of the initial hospital visit, lab/diagnostic/radiology, supportive care, drugs, and adverse events through the observation of payments across all appropriate settings of care (inpatient hospitalization, skilled nursing facility, outpatient hospital/clinical, physician's office, home health, and hospice). A patient undergoing chemotherapy incurred costs of $120,468 over two years, while a patient avoiding chemotherapy only incurred costs of $40,720. Results The incremental cost of a patient receiving induction therapy was calculated to be $79,748. For a national health care plan with an assumed average of one million members results in a cost of $283,856 to treat patients whose leukemia would not respond to induction chemotherapy. The overall societal impact of treating this patient population with ineffective therapy is $104 million. Conclusions Patients who are subjected to ineffective chemotherapy face the cytotoxic effects of the treatment, none of the benefits of treatment response, and impose a significant cost burden to themselves and the healthcare payment system. Diagnostics currently in development that can identify patients at the time of diagnosis with disease unresponsive to therapy may have the ability to alleviate unnecessary costs, while steering patients to better tailored and more effective therapies.
