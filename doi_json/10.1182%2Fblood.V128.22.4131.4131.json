    "abstract_text": "Background: XPO1 (exportin-1/CRM1) mediates nuclear export of proteins containing leucine-rich amino-acid consensus sequences. XPO1 cargo proteins include many of the major tumor suppressor proteins (p53, IkB, pRB, FOXOs) and their export leads to the inactivation of cell cycle checkpoints. Overexpression of XPO1 has been reported to correlate with poor cancer prognosis. The Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compound, selinexor, binds covalently to the cargo pocket on XPO1, inhibits nuclear export which leads to cell cycle arrest and specific cancer cell death. Selinexor is currently in advanced clinical trials for patients with solid and hematological malignancies including patients with relapsed/refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) (NCT02227251). Using preclinical models, we recently demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors (PI) can re-sensitize multiple myeloma that acquired resistance to selinexor. Here, we aimed to find if treatment with selinexor and bortezomib is beneficial for the treatment of DLBCL. Methods: DLBCLcell lines were treated with selinexor in combination with bortezomib. Cell viability was examined using standard viability assays after 72 hours of treatment. Whole cell protein lysates were evaluated by immunoblotting. NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity was analyzed using an ELISA assay. WSU-DLCL2 cells were grown as sub-cutaneous tumors in ICR SCID mice. Tumor bearing mice were divided into 4 groups and were administered either vehicle, sub-maximum tolerated doses of selinexor (10 mg/kg p.o. twice a week, M, Th), bortezomib (1 mg/kg i.v. twice a week, M, TH) and the combination of selinexor (10 mg/kg p.o. twice a week) plus bortezomib (1 mg/kg i.v. twice a week). Results: The combination treatment of selinexor with bortezomib synergistically killed DLBCL cells compared to the single agents alone. Co-treatment with bortezomib enhanced selinexor mediated nuclear retention of I\u03baB-\u03b1. Selinexor plus bortezomib treatment decreased NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity. Finally, the combination of selinexor with bortezomib showed superior anti-tumor efficacy in the combination group compared to single agent treatments in WSU-DLCL2 xenograft model. Conclusions: Based on our results, inhibition of NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity through forced nuclear retention of I\u03baB appears to be an important mechanism underlying the synergistic effects of selinexor plus bortezomib in many different cell lines including DLBCL. The superior efficacy of selinexor plus bortezomib combination both in vitro and in vivo when compared to single agents along provides a rational for conducting clinical trials with these combinations in DLBCL patients.
