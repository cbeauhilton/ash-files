    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1667 MicroRNAs are key regulators of gene expression that regulate normal differentiation and contribute to malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells. Using microRNA microarrays we identified increased expression of miR-486 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) compared to normal CD34+ cells. In both normal and CML cells, miR-486 expression level was significantly higher in MEP compared to HSC, GMP and CMP populations. Treatment with Imatinib resulted in reduced expression of miR-486-5p in CML CD34+ cells, suggesting that upregulation of miR-486-5p expression was at least in part BCR-ABL kinase dependent. Consistent with this ectopic expression of BCR-ABL in cord blood CD34+ cells using retroviral vectors resulted in 4.2 fold increase in miR-486-5p expression. miR-486-5p is located within the last intron of the Ankyrin-1 gene on chromosome 8 and is enriched in muscle cells. However, the role of miR-486-5p in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis has not been evaluated. To explore the role of miR-486-5p in growth and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HSPC), we first overexpressed hsa-miR-486-5p pre-microRNA in normal CD34+ cells using lentiviral vectors. CB CD34+ cells overexpressing miRNA-486-5p generated modestly increased numbers of cells (1.22 fold) in culture with SCF, IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF and EPO for 6 days compared to cells expressing control vectors, with increased numbers of erythroid cells and reduced numbers of myeloid cells. We further investigated the role of miR-486-5p on growth and differentiation of normal and leukemic HSPC by inhibiting miR-486-5p expression using a modified pmiRZip lentivirus vector expressing an anti-miR-486-5p sequence and comparing to cells expressing a control scrambled anti-miRNA sequence. Expression of anti-miR-486-5p resulted in reduced proliferation of normal CD34+ cells (32\u00b110% inhibition) and BCR-ABL transformed CD34+ cells (38\u00b17 % inhibition) with significantly greater inhibition of erythroid compared to myeloid cells. Anti-miR486-5p expression resulted in significantly increased apoptosis of BCR-ABL-transformed CD34+ cells but not normal CD34+ cells (CML CD34+ cells: scramble 11.1\u00b12.4%, anti-miR-486-5p 14.7\u00b11.7 % p=0.02; Normal CD34+ cells: scramble 9.7\u00b15.4%, anti-486-5p 13.4\u00b17.9% p=0.15). Importantly, anti-miR-486-5p significantly enhanced the sensitivity of BCR-ABL transformed CD34+ cells to imatinib-mediated apoptosis [combination of scramble with IM: 17.7\u00b18.1%; anti-miR-486-5p with IM: 26.4\u00b113%]. A search for conserved miR-486-5p target genes in the TargetScan database identified the important hematopoietic negative regulatory factors Foxo1 and Pten amongst the highest ranking targets. Using pMIR-REPORT constructs containing miR-486-5p seed sites within the Foxo1 and Pten 3'-UTR we showed that Foxo1 and Pten are direct targets of miR-486-5p. Expression of anti-miR-486-5p increased Foxo1 and Pten protein expression and decreased active Akt in normal and CML CD34+ cells. Knockdown of Foxo1 using shRNA partly blocked the suppressive effects of anti-miR486-5p on the growth of CD34+ cells. In summary, we have shown that miR-486-5p expression is modulated during hematopoietic differentiation and plays an important role in regulating hematopoietic progenitor growth and differentiation towards the erythroid lineage. We further show that miR-486-5p expression is enhanced in CML CD34+ cells, related at least in part to BCR-ABL kinase activity, and contributes to enhanced progenitor growth and survival. Inhibition of miR-486-5p results in enhanced sensitivity of CML CD34+ cells to IM-induced apoptosis. miR-486-5p effects are mediated at least in part through inhibition of Foxo1 and Pten expression. We conclude that miR-486-5p represents a novel regulatory mechanism that promotes erythroid differentiation in normal hematopoiesis and modulates Bcr-Abl-mediated transformation and tyrosine kinase inhibitor sensitivity in CML progenitors.
