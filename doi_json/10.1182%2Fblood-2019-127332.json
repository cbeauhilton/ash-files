    "abstract_text": "Background B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a transmembrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily involved in the regulation of B cell proliferation and survival as well as maturation/differentiation into plasma cells. In multiple myeloma cells, overexpression of BCMA has been shown to activate mitogen activated protein kinase pathways (AKT, ERK1/2, and NF-\u03baB) and upregulates anti-apoptotic proteins (MCL1, BCL2, BCL-xL) resulting in cellular proliferation. Immunotherapeutic strategies targeting BCMA are showing great promise in heavily pre-treated refractory multiple myeloma. Light Chain Amyloidosis (AL) is a multisystem disorder of clonal plasma cells that results in the production of an abnormal light chain which misfolds and deposits in the organs leading to disruption of tissue architecture, cellular stress, dysfunction and eventually, death. The smaller burden and lower proliferative potential of the offending clonal plasma cells in amyloidosis may potentially lend itself favorably to immunotherapeutic strategies targeting BCMA. Given the efficacy of this approach in MM, the evaluation of BCMA expression on the surface of amyloidogenic plasma cells is warranted. Methods All patients diagnosed with Light chain Amyloidosis at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, NY between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2018, who had unstained bone marrow samples were identified. These unstained BM biopsy samples were prospectively stained for BCMA expression using Immunohistochemistry (IHC). We utilized a clinical-grade assay (clone D6; catalog sc-390147; company Santa-Cruz; monoclonal antibody; dilution 1:400) in a CLIA compliant setting. We scored the biopsies for BCMA expression, intensity, and site of staining. We also obtained their demographic details, staging, and cytogenetic information for the patients with available samples. Results During the queried period, 28 unstained samples were available for testing from the time of disease diagnosis. The median age of the population was 63 years (range 41-73). 64% of patients were male and consistent with the literature; a majority of patients (75%) had lambda-typic clonal plasma cells. Cytogenetic abnormalities using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were reviewed, t(11;14) was seen in 36% patients, and chromosome 1q and del 13q were each seen in 32% of patients. No patient had t(4;14) or del 17p. The median clonal PC burden in BM at diagnosis was 10% (range2-80%) and 36% had > 10% plasma cells. In clonal PCs, the median BCMA expression was 80% (range 20-100%). Only one patient had a staining intensity under 50% (20%). Membranous staining was noted in 82% of patients and a Golgi pattern in 11%. The median staining intensity was 2 (range 1-3). Of the patients with baseline diagnostic samples available for testing, six patients had additional unstained bone marrow samples for staining at the time of relapse. The majority of patients (83%) who relapsed had >10% plasma cells with a higher median plasma cell burden of 35% (range 10-80). The median BCMA expression was 65% (range 50-80) with no patient having <50% expression. The staining pattern was membranous in 50%, Golgi in 17%, and Golgi-membranous in 33%. At the time of relapse, the median clonal PC burden was 13% (range 5-30). BCMA expression continued to be present at the time of relapse with a median 75% (range 50-100) with predominantly membranous staining (83%). The median staining intensity in both diagnostic and relapsed tissue within the six samples studied was 1. Conclusions Our study represents the first description of BCMA expression on the surface of amyloidogenic plasma cells to our knowledge. BCMA is uniformly expressed by pathologic PCs in AL amyloidosis both at the time of diagnosis and relapse. Given the efficacy of BCMA directed therapy in multiple myeloma, further investigation of these agents in light-chain amyloidosis are warranted and may provide an effective therapeutic strategy in this devastating disease.
