    "abstract_text": "TFPI is an important inhibitor of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. It efficiently inhibits TF-FVIIa and FXa by quaternary complex formation. Plasma contains various truncated forms of TFPI which are poor inhibitors, and full length (fl)TFPI (0.3 \u2013 0.5 nM) which is the most active TFPI in plasma. flTFPI is released from platelets upon activation, and increases flTFPI concentrations locally up to 30-fold. Most intravascular TFPI (\u223c80%) is associated with endothelial cells. Both endothelial forms, TFPIa and TFPIb, are similarily effective inhibitors of FX activation on the endothelial cell surface. Inhibition of TFPI in hemophilia models with blocking antibodies, aptamers or peptide inhibitors improves hemostasis and may become an option to treat hemophilia. Recently, we presented peptide inhibitors of TFPI that enhance coagulation in hemophilia models. Two optimized peptides, JBT-A7 and JBT-B5, efficiently blocked inhibitory activity of TFPI and bound to distinct binding sites. We demonstrated the crystal structure of JBT-A7, a linear TFPI inhibitory peptide composed of 20 amino acids, bound to NtermK1 (TFPI 1-83). JBT-B5, a cyclic TFPI inhibitory peptide of 23 amino acids, co-crystallized with TFPI KD1-KD2 (TFPI 22-150). Overlaying the KD1 structure in the KD1-KD2/JBT-B5 and the NTermK1/JBT-A7 complex provided atomic details for linking the two peptide entities. Binding of peptides to TFPI and TFPI fragments was studied by BioCore. The TFPI inhibitory potential of the resulting fusion peptide was tested in model systems (FXa inhibition and TF-FVIIa catalyzed FX activation) and global hemostatic assays (TF-triggered thrombin generation) using hemophilia plasma. To model situations of increased TFPI concentration, both model and plasma assays were carried out at TFPI concentrations up to 10 nM, which is 40-50-fold higher than the physiological flTFPI plasma concentration. To characterize the inhibition of platelet TFPI, we used platelets isolated from blood samples and platelet rich plasma from different donors. Binding of a biotinylated fusion peptide on living HUVE cells was assessed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and fluorescence microscopy. Inhibition of cell surface TFPI was analyzed on cultivated HUVECs stimulated with TNFa for TF expression. We monitored FXa generation by the TFPI-dependent cell surface FX activation complex by conversion of an FXa-specific fluorogenic substrate. The overlay of the crystal structures of KD1-KD2/JBT-B5 and the NTermKD1/JBT-A7 complexes revealed non-overlapping epitopes and close proximity of the termini of both peptides. The distance could be bridged by an approximately ten amino acid linker. A fusion peptide with a 10-serine-linker was synthesized and showed highly improved dissociation in Biacore experiments and most efficiently inhibited TFPI activity in the model assays. In contrast, single peptides only partially inhibit TFPI especially at high TFPI concentrations. In thrombin generation assays using hemophilia plasma, the fusion peptide showed a substantially higher ability than the single peptides to increase the thrombin peak even at elevated TFPI. The fusion peptide efficiently inhibited TFPI released from platelets and improved thrombin generation in TFPI deficient plasma reconstituted with platelets as the only source of TFPI released upon platelet activation. The fusion peptide was also shown to bind TFPI on the surface of living HUVECs. This is consistent with its binding epitopes on KD1 and KD2 which result in inhibition of cell surface TFPI in a cell based FX activation assay. Thus, we demonstrate that a molecular fusion peptide most efficiently inhibits all physiologic forms of TFPI. X-ray structures of binary and ternary peptide TFPI complexes provided atomic details for linking two single peptides to generate a fusion peptide that most efficiently blocks TFPI in plasma, released from platelets and associated with endothelial cells. It most efficiently neutralizes TFPI even at substantially elevated concentrations occurring at sites of platelet activation. Our observations support the notion that targeting TFPI with TFPI inhibitors is a promising novel strategy to mitigate the bleeding risk in hemophilia patients.
