    "abstract_text": "Azacytidine (AZA), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in some cancer cells. We determined the impact of AZA on a panel of human myeloma cell lines (HMCL); KMS 12PE, KMS 18, LP-1, NCI-H929, OPM-2, RPMI-8226 and U266 and in an in vivo murine model of multiple myeloma (5T33 model). Dose responsiveness to AZA was determined via MTS assays with a range of AZA doses (1\u201310mM) for 72 hours. FACS and cell cycle analysis were used to evaluate the profile of the cells after exposure to AZA for 72 hours. MTS assays demonstrated a dose and time dependent AZA-induced inhibition of HMCL viability with effective concentrations of AZA ranging from 1\u201310 mM. This was associated with accumulation of cells in the G o /G 1 phase with decreasing number of cells in the S and G2/M phases. Western Blot analysis using antibodies against caspases 3,8,10, PARP, phospho-ERK, ERK, Stat3 and phospho -Stat3 were performed to help characterize the mechanism(s) of cell killing. Cleavage of caspases 3,8,10 and PARP within 24 hours of AZA treatment confirmed early AZA-induced HMCL apoptosis. phospho-ERK which was absent in untreated U266 appeared after 48 hours exposure to 5mM AZA. Similarly inhibitors of caspases 3,8 and 9 were used to determine which apoptotic pathway was being preferentially activated by AZA. Inhibitors of both caspase 3 and 9 effectively abrogated AZA-induced apoptosis in U266 and NCI-H929. In contrast caspase 8 inhibitor was less effective which is consistent with AZA acting via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Reactivation of p16 gene by AZA-induced hypomethylation was assessed with methylation specific PCR. MSP-PCR of the p16 gene indicated a loss of methylation and up-regulated transcription after 48 hours treatment with 5 mM AZA. The level of IL-6 in conditioned media from U266 cells treated with AZA was determined by ELISA assay and demonstrated a rapid fall in autocrine IL-6 production. RT-PCR demonstrated rapid AZA-induced cessation of IL-6 transcription temporarily associated with the disappearance of upstream phospho -Stat3. Addition of exogenous IL-6 did not rescue U266 from AZA-induced apoptosis. AZA was also administered to a 5T33 murine model of multiple myeloma at increasing concentrations (1, 3, 10 mg/kg). At 10 mg/kg the median survival of vehicle versus AZA treated mice was 28 days versus 30+ days (p=0.003). These findings justify further evaluation of AZA as a potential therapeutic agent for multiple myeloma.",
