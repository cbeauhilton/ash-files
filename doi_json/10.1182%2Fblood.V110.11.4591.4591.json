    "abstract_text": "The somatic mutation JAK2 V617F has been identified as a pathogenic factor in typical chronic myeloproliferative diseases (MPD) such as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMF). In typical forms of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), JAK2 V617F mutation is rarely present (2\u20135%); on the contrary, it has been found with higher prevalence in patients with RARS-T (i.e. MDS/MPD-U with platelet count >600\u00d710 9 /L and ringed sideroblasts more than 15%) and in a subgroup of MDS patients with isolated 5q deletion and a proliferative bone marrow. In this study we analysed the JAK2 V617F mutational status in 53 MDS patients (26 males, 27 females; median age at the time of the study 76 years, range 45\u201391). Patients were classified as follows: 4 cases 5q- syndrome, 3 RCMD, 5 MDS/MPD, 1 MDS-U, 23 RA, 12 RARS, 5 RAEB. DNA was extracted from purified granulocytes; all samples were analyzed by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), according to Baxter el al (2005). DNA samples were further subjected to direct sequencing for confirmatory testing. The JAK2 V617F mutation was present in 3 cases, with an overall frequency of 5%. With respect to MDS subtype, 1 patient had RA and 2 RARS. Among the 12 RARS patients, the two V617F postive displayed thrombocytosis (680\u00d710 9 /L and 649\u00d710 9 /L), whereas none of the 10 RARS V617F negative patients showed high platelet counts (median Plt 157\u00d710 9 /L, range 5\u2013422\u00d710 9 /L). In one JAK2 mutant case, thrombocytosis required treatment with hydroxyurea. Moreover, the two V617F positive RARS patients displayed higher WBC count (6.2\u00d710 9 /L and 8.5\u00d710 9 /L) than the V617F negatives (median WBC 4.05\u00d710 9 /L); no difference was observed in Hb levels. The JAK2 positive RA patient had 10% of sideroblasts in bone marrow, normal platelet and WBC count and no proliferative characteristics; since the occurrence of the mutation may be an early event and preceed the classical manifestations of MDS/MPD, a longer follow-up is necessary to determine its possible prognostic significance. Considering the V617F negative MDS cases, only one patient, diagnosed as MDS/MPD, showed a platelet count >600\u00d710 9 /L. In conclusion, we confirmed recent reports showing that JAK2 V617F is present with low prevalence (about 5%) in MDS; in particular, the JAK2 mutation identifies a subset of MDS patients with and \u201coverlap\u201d syndrome, characterised by proliferative bone marrow morphology and frequent thrombocytosis and leucocytosis, who may benefit from JAK2 specifically targeted therapies.",
