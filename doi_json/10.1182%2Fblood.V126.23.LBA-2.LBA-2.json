    "abstract_text": "Immunosuppressive treatment (IST) with horse antithymocyte globulin (hATG) and cyclosporine (CsA) for severe aplastic anemia (SAA) has a 60-65% rate of overall hematologic response (OR) and approximately 10% complete response (CR). These rates have remained stable over the last three decades despite efforts to improve upon this regimen (Scheinberg Blood 2012). Eltrombopag (EPAG), an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist has activity in refractory SAA producing hematologic responses, the majority multilineage, in about 40% of patients when administered as a single agent (Olnes NEJM 2012; Desmond Blood 2014). We conducted an investigator-initiated, phase II, single-center trial to test the efficacy of adding EPAG to h-ATG/CsA ( clinicaltrials.gov , NCT01623167), using a triple cohort design to optimize the regimen. Eighty-eight patients with treatment-naive SAA have been enrolled from July 2012 to October 2015. All received standard h-ATG and CsA. EPAG was administered at 150 mg daily to three consecutive cohorts: in the first (n=30) and second (n=31) cohorts, EPAG was introduced after hATG, from day 14 until 6 months (cohort 1) or 3 months (cohort 2), due to initial concern of hepatotoxicity. In the third cohort, EPAG was concurrent with hATG on day 1 and continued for 6 months (n=27). As analysis of our previous IST trials suggested that CR correlates with better survival and less evolution to MDS/AML, the primary endpoint in the current protocol was CR at 6 months. Baseline enrollment characteristics were similar across cohorts: median age was 31 years (range 3 \u2013 82; 20% were 1%. EPAG was well tolerated when combined with CsA and hATG; 2 patients discontinued EPAG for severe cutaneous reactions, and 6 patients withdrew before 6 months due to refractoriness (n=4) or evolution to MDS (n=2). OR and CR were higher at 3 months and 6 months for all cohorts compared to historic rates (Table): OR at 6 months was 80%, 87% and 92%, respectively for the three cohorts; CR at 6 months was 33%, 26%, and 54%, respectively. For all patients evaluable to date, OR at 3 and 6 months of 80% and 85% and CR rates of 28 and 34% were higher when compared to our historical rates (p<0.001 for both 3 and 6 months). Improvements in blood counts among partial responders were robust by 3 months in all cohorts: median ANC 1790/ul; hemoglobin 10 gm/dL; and platelets 60,500/ul. For patients with very severe neutropenia (ANC500/uL was 47 days for all cohorts (n=23), and 35 days for cohort 3 (n=7). Among responders, median time to transfusion-independence for platelets was 32 days and for red cells 42 days. Serial BM biopsies showed improved cellularity in 80% without increased fibrosis. Median increase from baseline in BM CD34+ cells, as measured by flow cytometry, was 17-fold and 4-fold at 3 months for cohorts 1 and 2 respectively (p<0.001). Pharmacokinetics at 3 months showed a trend toward higher drug bioavailability with older age and female sex. Previously established baseline predictors for response such as telomere length, reticulocyte count, lymphocyte count, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, were not predictive of outcome. Twelve patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) due to relapse (n=3), refractoriness (n=6) or evolution to MDS (n=3). Death occurred in 3 subjects. At median follow up 15 months (range 1 \u2013 42 m), cytogenetic abnormalities have occurred in 7 patients: 4 monosomy or partial deletion of chromosome 7, 1 complex (t(3;3)(q21;q26), -7), 1 deletion 13q that later normalized, and 1 subject with trisomy 6 and trisomy 15 in 2 metaphases. We sequenced 54 candidate genes, recurrently mutated in MDS/AML: somatic mutations were not identified in 4 of 7 subjects prior to treatment or at the time of cytogenetic evolution. Clonal evolution to MDS occurred at a similar frequency compared to our historic experience with standard IST. Addition of EPAG to IST markedly increases overall and complete hematologic response rates in treatment-naive SAA. These results suggest that immediate institution of EPAG with IST may salvage and expand residual hematopoietic stem cells in aplastic anemia, accelerating the rate and quality of hematopoietic recovery. Rapid blood count improvement and reduced transfusion burden support early use of EPAG for patients with newly diagnosed severe aplastic anemia.
