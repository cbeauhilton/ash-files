    "abstract_text": "Drug resistance is the most common reason for treatment failure in multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell cancer of the bone marrow (BM). Our previous studies have shown that macrophage (M\u03a6) infiltration is increased in MM BM, and these MM-associated M\u03a6s induce MM drug resistance by protecting MM cells from chemotherapeutic-induced cell death. A recently published clinical study also suggests that the number of BM M\u03a6s negatively correlates with MM drug response and patient survival. Why MM BM harbors more M\u03a6 is not well understood. In general, M\u03a6s are derived from circulating monocytes, and monocytes are recruited to tissues by chemokines and differentiate into M\u03a6s. In this study, we examined monocyte/M\u03a6 chemokine expression in MM BM and determined that CCL14 and CCL3 were functional chemokines that regulated monocyte/M\u03a6 infiltration in MM BM. To identify chemokines that regulate monocyte/M\u03a6 infiltration in the MM tumor bed, we examined a panel of chemokines expressed in MM patient BM cells. Specifically, total BM cells (both CD138 + and CD138 - cells) from MM patients were assayed by qPCR for target gene expression analysis. MM BM cells highly expressed CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1\u03b1), CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2), CCL5 (RANTES), and CCL14 (HCC-1), but not CCL8 (MCP-2), CCL7 (MCP-3) or CCL13 (MCP-4). Next, we compared expression of those chemokines in MM BM vs. healthy BM aspirates by ELISA. MIP-1 \u03b1 and HCC-1 were highly expressed in MM BM aspirates (n=11), but not in BM from healthy donors (n=7; P <0.05). Immunohistochemistry staining also confirmed that MM BM (n=5 patients) highly expressed MIP-1 \u03b1 and HCC-1. Based on our findings, we hypothesized that elevated M\u03a6 infiltration in MM BM might be due to MM BM overexpression of MIP-1\u03b1 and HCC-1. To test this hypothesis, we first examined MIP-1\u03b1 and HCC-1 function in monocyte migration. In vitro chemotactic assay showed that adding MIP-1\u03b1 or HCC-1 neutralizing antibody inhibited monocyte migration to cocultured BM stromal cells (BMSCs) and MM cells ( P <0.05). The antibodies also inhibited monocyte migration to ex vivo cultured BM cells from MM patients ( P <0.05). In a murine MM mouse model, C57BL/KawRij mice inoculated with 5TGM1, a murine MM cell line, developed tumors in hind leg bones. Both flow cytometry analysis and immunohistochemistry staining suggested that the tumor-bearing mice had an increased number of M\u03a6s in the BM, compared with healthy mice ( P <0.05). Because HCC-1 does not have murine homology but it has the highest amino acid sequence similarity to MIP-1\u03b1, we treated the mice with MIP-1\u03b1 neutralization antibody. Intra-peritoneal injection of mouse MIP-1\u03b1 antibody decreased the M\u03a6 number in BM ( P <0.05). Such in vivo findings strongly suggest that MIP-1\u03b1 regulates M\u03a6 infiltration in MM BM. We also examined the source cells that contributed to high MIP-1 \u03b1 and HCC-1 expression in MM BM. Primary MM cells (CD138 + ) and non-malignant BM cells (CD138 - ) were isolated from patient (n=5) BM aspirates. qPCR analysis showed that both CD138 + and CD138 - cells had high MIP-1\u03b1 and HCC-1 expression. Further, BMSC/MM coculture stimulated MIP-1\u03b1 overexpression in BMSCs. Finally, we examined the association between MIP-1\u03b1 or HCC-1 expression and the number of BM M\u03a6 in MM patients. The chemokine expression in BM aspirates was determined by ELISA, and the number of M\u03a6 was measured by flow cytometry analysis for CD14 + /CD68 + cells. We found that MIP-1\u03b1 expression was positively associated with the number of BM M\u03a6s ( P <0.05). To summarize, our findings suggest that CCL14 and CCL3 facilitate monocyte/M\u03a6 infiltration in MM BM. Inhibiting these 2 chemokines may decrease the number of MM-associated M\u03a6s, therefore increasing MM cell vulnerability to chemotherapy. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
