    "abstract_text": "B cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (B-NHL) consists of different pathological entities that are frequently characterized by distinct genetic alterations. However, the knowledge on these genetic lesions in B-NHL is still limited. In order to obtain a more comprehensive view of genetic lesions in B-NHL, we performed genome-wide analysis of copy number (CN) alterations as well as allelic imbalances using Affymetrix SNP arrays in 190 B-NHL cases, including 64 samples of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 62 of follicular lymphoma (FL), 64 of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALT-L). SNP array data were analyzed with CNAG/AsCNAR software, which enabled sensitive detection of CN alterations in allele-specific manner, and thus allelic imbalances, without depending on availability of paired normal controls. Most frequent numerical abnormalities in B-NHL were gains of chromosomes 3 and 18, although gains of chromosome 3 were less prominent in FL. Chromosomal deletions that lead to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) were commonly found in 1p, 6q and 10q. However, the more chracteristic feature of B-NHL genomes was high frequency of CN netural LOH or uniparental disomy (UPD), which was found in 35 cases of DLBCL (55%), 32 cases of FL (52%) and 18 cases of MALT-L (28%). It is widely distributed in the genome, but more frequently found in 1p, 1q, 6p, 6q and 12q. High-grade amplifications and homozygous deletions frequently provide a clue to identify relevant gene targets. In our series, 12 loci of high-grade amplifications and 14 loci of homozygous deletions were identified, and helped to specify the candidate genes. These regions included, FCGR2 B amplified in 5 cases of DLBCL, RERE amplified in 2 cases of FL and CDKN2A/CDKN2B deleted in 9 cases of DLBCL. The most notable finding in the current study was, however, the identification of common genomic alterations in genes that regulate activation of NFkB pathway in more than 50% of B-NHL cases. Eight lymphoma cases harbored high-grade amplification of cREL gene, and gain including cREL was detected in 28 samples (14.7%). Fourteen cases had gains or amplification of TRAF6 , and another 16 cases had deletion at 10q including PTEN . These abnormalities were supposed to cause dysregulation of NFkB. Aberrant NFkB activity has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of B-NHL, and our study confirmed that dysregulation of NFkB pathway was main mechanism of lymphomagenesis, providing further rationale that he treatment against malignant lymphoma with inhibitor of NF kappa B pathway.",
