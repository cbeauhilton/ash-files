    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Severe COVID-19 pneumonia is characterised by respiratory and multi-organ failure in the context of marked systemic inflammation. This hyperinflammatory syndrome is reflected by the elevation of several inflammatory molecules, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, IL-6, troponin, and D-dimer. In a subset of patients, early intervention with signal inhibitors may treat the Covid-19 hyperinflammatory syndrome before the development of acute lung injury and organ failure. We present a summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled, multi-arm trial with two novel inflammatory signal inhibitors; Ruxolitinib (RUX) and Fostamatinib (FOS) for the treatment of Covid-19 pneumonia. RUX is an oral Janus Associated Kinase (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitor approved for the treatment of splenomegaly, myelofibrosis and polycythaemia vera. Inhibition of STAT3 downregulates IL-6 and IL-23, which are important for the inflammatory effects of Th17 cells. Further, JAK2 inhibition has been shown to reduce levels of TNFa and CRP, as well as reducing viral cellular entry and assembly. FOS is an oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia. Studies of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) suggest that the pathogenesis relies on a series of SYK events leading to cytokine and chemokine release. FOS acts by inhibiting SYK activity, blocking the production and release of cytokines induced via C-lectin receptors and Fc receptor activation, ameliorating the cytokine storm which precedes ARDS. Primary Objective: The primary objective of MATIS is to determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS compared to standard of care (SOC) to reduce the proportion of hospitalised patients progressing from mild or moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia at 14 days from baseline. Secondary objectives at 7, 14 and 28 days: - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce mortality - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the need for invasive ventilation or ECMO - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the need for non-invasive ventilation - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the proportion of patients suffering significant oxygen desaturation - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the need for renal replacement therapy - Determine the efficacy of RUX and FOS to reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism COVID-19 pneumonia - Determine the efficacy of RUX and FOS to reduce the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia [graded by a modified WHO Ordinal Scale] - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the level of inflammatory biomarkers - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the duration of hospital admission - Evaluate the safety of RUX and FOS for COVID-19 pneumonia Study Design : This is a multi-arm, two-stage, open-label, randomised (1:1:1) controlled trial. Participants will be recruited during hospitalisation for COVID-19 in multiple centres in the UK. Eligible participants (table 1) are randomised to one of the three interventions (RUX, FOS, SOC) by a central web-based randomisation service. This uses randomisation sequences with random block sizes, stratified by age (<65 and \u226565 years) and site. The treatment duration is 14 days from baseline. Patients receiving RUX will be administered 10mg BD for Day 1-7 and 5mg BD for Day 8-14. FOS will be administered as 150mg BD day 1-7 and 100mg BD day 8-14. Participants receive follow up assessments on days 7, 14 and 28 after the first dose. Outcomes: Primary endpoints will be assessed with a pairwise comparison (FOS vs SOC and RUX vs SOC) of the proportion of participants diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia within 14 days. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia is defined by a modified WHO COVID-19 Ordinal Score 5, comprising the following indicators of disease severity: - Death - Requirement for invasive ventilation - Requirement for non-invasive ventilation including CPAP or high flow oxygen - O2 saturation < 90% on 60% inspired oxygen Samples size : In stage 1 of this multi-arm study, 171 participants will be randomised (57 per arm). Following an interim analysis, if either intervention shows a signal of efficacy, stage 2 will recruit a further 95 participants per arm (Fig 1). Trial Status : Recruitment is ongoing and commenced 2nd October 2020. Currently 127 patients are recruited and stage 1 is projected to be completed by 1st September 2021.

OffLabel Disclosure: Fostamatanib - is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK). In the context of treating COVID-19, Fostamatanib acts by inhibiting SYK activist, blocking the production and release of cytokines induced via C-lectin receptors and Fc receptor activation, ameliorating the cytokine storm which precedes ARDS. Studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome induced by coronavirus, suggest that pathogenesis relies on a series of SYK events. SYK medicates ctuokine and chemokine release, induced by the activation of C-lectin receptors and immunoglobulin Fc receptors, resulting in neutrophil and monocyte lung ingress, sequential activation of neutrophil extracellular traps and activation of lung epithelium and multiple myeloid cell. This is followed by inflammation and tissue destruction that contribute to ARDS. Ruxolitinib - A JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor. JAK and STAT molecules are proteins that trance extracellular stimulation into intracellular signalling, leading to expression of host inflammatory cytokines and a variety of immune cells. In the context of MATIS, we use low dose ruxolitinib to treat COVID-19 by targeting key signalling pathways implicated in the hyper-inflammatory response of patients with COVID-19 infection. The mechanisms of Ruxolitinib to act in COVID-19 is through inhibition of STAT3 activation, down regulating IL-6 and IL-23, signalling important for the inflammatory effects of Th17 cells. Furthermore it leads to reductions of TNFa and CRP.",
