    "abstract_text": "Double hit lymphoma (DHL), defined as B cell lymphoma with a c-MYC rearrangement plus a IGH/BCL2 rearrangement, confers a poor prognosis. Outcomes with R-CHOP are dismal with reported 2 year EFS <30% in multiple series. To improve upon these results, Burkitt type regimens such as R-HyperCVAD and dose adjusted (DA) R-EPOCH have been attempted, but 2 year EFS remains < 50% in early reports. In addition, the SWOG-9704 study found a benefit for consolidative autologous stem cell transplant (autoSCT) in high risk DLBCL, likely including some DHL, although this reported benefit has not been confirmed in three other randomized European studies. Since 2010 the treatment algorithm at Oregon Health & Science University for fit patients with DHL has been DA-R-EPOCH followed by consolidative autoSCT in responding patients. Here we report the first 16 patients treated with consolidative autoSCT. At diagnosis, the median age was 58, and the median IPI was 3. All patients had rearrangements of c-MYC and IGH/BCL2. One of the c-MYC rearrangements was a classical t(8;14); the translocation partners in the other cases were unknown. Three patients also had a \u2018triple hit\u2019 with an additional BCL6 rearrangement. Fourteen patients received DA-R-EPOCH with intrathecal prophylaxis for induction. One received R-CHOP at another institution, and one received R-HyperCVAD. 15 of 16 patients were in CR after induction. Stem cell mobilization was performed with G-CSF +/- plerixafor, and BEAM was utilized as the high dose conditioning regimen. With a median follow-up of 18 months, the estimated 2 year PFS is 91 %, and the 2 year OS is 91 % in the 16 patients who underwent consolidative autoSCT. There were no deaths from non-relapse mortality, and the only relapse was 6 months post-transplant. All other patients undergoing autoSCT remain alive and in remission. An additional 15 patients also underwent induction with DA-R-EPOCH but did not proceed to autoSCT. Four patients who had intended to undergo autoSCT were refractory to induction. Of the remaining 11 patients, 9 did not pursue autoSCT because of age and/or comorbidities, and 1 each declined out of personal preference or insurance denial. Four of these 11 have relapsed or died. Our results suggest that consolidative autoSCT, especially after DA-R-EPOCH induction, is an effective treatment strategy for DHL in fit patients and should be explored in prospective studies.
