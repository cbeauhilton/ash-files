    "abstract_text": "Abstract 860 Background: PD 0332991, the only known selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6, is reversible and orally bioavailable. Inhibition of CDK4/6 phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) induces prolonged early G1 cell cycle arrest and synchronous progression to S phase upon withdrawal, which sensitizes human multiple myeloma (MM) cells to killing by bortezomib (B) or dexamethasone (D) in vitro and in animal models. This multicenter phase I trial is investigating the combination of PD 0332991 with these agents in MM during prolonged G1 arrest alone (Schedule A) or together with synchronization into S phase (Schedule B). The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of PD 0332991 and the schedule for combination. Methods: Adults with Rb protein-positive, symptomatic, relapsed and/or refractory MM (International Myeloma Working Group [IMWG] definition) after \u22651 prior treatment were eligible. Patients (pts) received oral PD 0332991 once daily on Days 1\u201321 of a 28-day cycle (Schedule A) or Days 1\u201312 of a 21-day cycle (Schedule B) for a maximum of 10 cycles. The starting dose of PD 0332991 was 100 mg, with planned escalation to 125 mg or de-escalation to 75 mg. Intravenous B 1.0 mg/m 2 (with planned escalation to 1.3 mg/m 2 ) and oral D 20 mg were administered on Days 8, 11, 15, and 18 on both schedules. A 3+3 dose-escalation scheme was used. The MTD was defined as the dose level at which \u22641/6 pts experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), with the next higher dose level having \u22652/3 or \u22652/6 pts with DLTs. The RP2D was determined based on the MTD and overall safety and tolerability. The primary endpoint was first-cycle DLTs; tumor response (per IMWGURC) and PD 0332991-mediated inhibition of CDK4/6 activity and cell proliferation by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of CDK4/6-specific phosphorylation of Rb (pSRb) and Ki67, respectively, in bone marrow MM cells were secondary endpoints. The effects of B and D on PD 0332991 pharmacokinetics were also evaluated. Results: Twenty-one pts were enrolled: 9 on Schedule A (3 on PD 0332991 100 mg and 6 on 75 mg); 12 on Schedule B (7 on 100 mg and 5 on 125 mg). Sixty-seven percent of pts had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1. At baseline, median \u03b2 2 microglobulin was 3.9 (range 1.6\u201314.8), median hemoglobin was 10.9 (7.3\u201313.4), and median calcium was 9.1 (6.6\u201311.5). The median number of prior therapies was 4 (range 1\u20139); 86% had received prior B. Eighteen pts have discontinued (14 due to progressive disease; 4 due to an adverse event [AE]). On Schedule A, 2/3 pts on PD 0332991 100 mg and 2/6 pts on 75 mg experienced DLTs (inability to receive \u226580% of PD 0332991 or B doses due to treatment-related toxicity), thus the MTD was not determined. On Schedule B, 1/6 DLT-evaluable pts on 100 mg and 2/4 on 125 mg experienced DLTs, and the MTD was determined to be PD 0332991 100 mg plus B 1.0 mg/m 2 and D 20 mg. The most common treatment-related AEs were grade \u22653 thrombocytopenia (n=13) and neutropenia (n=7). There were no pts with QTc intervals >500 msec observed on study. The mean plasma AUC (0\u201312) of PD 0332991 was 539 ng \u00b7 h/mL in the absence and 555 ng \u00b7 h/mL in the presence of B and D (n=6). IHC showed preferential and complete (13/16 pts) or >80% (3/16 pts) inhibition of both pSRb and Ki67 in bone marrow MM cells before initiation of B and D treatment on Day 8, and cell cycle progression following PD 0332991 withdrawal on Day 18 of Schedule B (7/7 pts). One pt achieved a very good partial response (VGPR), 1 achieved a PR, and 3 had stable disease \u22653 months. Conclusions: In this first phase I trial of PD 0332991 in combination therapy, the MTD and RP2D have been determined to be PD 0332991 100 mg plus B 1.0 mg/m 2 and D 20 mg on Schedule B in MM. The most commonly reported AEs were cytopenias, consistent with the known safety profiles of PD 0332991 and B. B and D had no apparent impact on the plasma AUC (0\u201312) of PD 0332991. Regardless of treatment history, PD 0332991 preferentially and completely inhibited CDK4/6 and cell cycle progression in MM cells, and this was reversible. Encouraging antitumor activity was observed in this heavily pretreated MM population, including VGPR in a pt with t(4:14) who had relapsed on lenalidomide, bortezomib, and carfilzomib therapies and a stem cell transplant. The phase II portion of the trial to evaluate the antitumor activity of targeting CDK4/6 with PD 0332991 using the Schedule B combination is underway.
