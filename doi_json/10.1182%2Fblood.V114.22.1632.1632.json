    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1632 Poster Board I-658 c-Myc, the product of an oncogene, is a common target of most leukemic oncoproteins. Deregulation of c-Myc is commonly found in human leukemic blasts. Transgenic over-expression of c-Myc induces myeloid, erythroid, and lymphocytic leukemia in mice, however whether c-Myc is absolutely required for leukemogenesis has not yet been addressed. Pten, a tumor-suppressing phosphatase, inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptotic cell death through repression of PI3K-Akt signaling. Inactivating mutations of Pten and deregulation of PI3K/Akt signaling are both involved in the development of both chronic and acute hematopoietic malignances. Mice with Pten deletions in h ematopoietic s tem c ells (HSCs) develop myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) followed by acute T lymphocytic or myeloid leukemia, reminiscent of disease progression in human chronic myelogenous leukemia. Mice with Pten deletions in lymphocytes develop lymphadenopathy (due to a chronic polyclonal lymphoproliferative disorder) as well as CD4 + T lymphocytic lymphoma. The appearance of these diseases in one animal model provides an opportunity to study the pathogenesis of multiple diseases simultaneously. To study whether c-Myc is required for the development of these hematopoietic disorders in Pten -mutant mice, we generated inducible Pten and c-Myc double-knockout mice ( Pten -/- c-Myc -/- ). By comparing the hematopoietic phenotypes of the Pten -/- c-Myc -/- mice with those of Pten -mutant ( Pten -/- ) mice, we found that both sets of mice developed MPD and lymphadenopathy, however none of the compound-mutant mice developed acute leukemia or lymphoma. Interestingly, in contrast to the MPD which developed in Pten -/- mice, which is dominated by granulocytes, megakaryocytes predominate in the MPD of Pten -/- c-Myc -/- mice. We have concluded that c-Myc is required for the development of both T lymphocytic lymphoma and the acute leukemic transformation of Pten -/- MPD, but is not essential for the development of chronic myeloid or lymphoid proliferative disorders. Our study suggests that deregulation of PI3K/Akt signaling in Pten -mutant hematopoietic cells protects these cells from apoptotic cell death, which results in chronic proliferative disorders, while the deregulation of c-Myc resulting from additional mutations promotes hematopoietic cell proliferation and blockage of maturation, and is absolutely required for the development of acute hematopoietic malignances.
