    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Selinexor is a first-in-class Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) that blocks XPO1, forcing the nuclear retention and re-activation of tumor suppressor proteins including p53, p73, FOXO, I\u25a1B and Rb. The phase 2b SADAL study included 134 patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL with single agent oral selinexor twice weekly. The overall response rate (ORR) was 29.1%, median duration of response (DOR) was 9.3 months and the median overall survival (OS) was 9 months. Based on these data, selinexor was recently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL, de novo or transformed from follicular lymphoma. Patients with DLBCL tend to be older (over the age of 65) and have a number of comorbidities, which limits the use of aggressive and multi-agent combination therapies. We performed post-hoc analyses of the SADAL study to determine the effects of age on the efficacy and safety of selinexor in this population. Methods: The SADAL study is multi-center, open-label Phase 2b study that enrolled patients with DLBCL previously treated with 2-5 lines of therapy. Patients may have progressed post-stem cell therapy (SCT) or were not candidates for SCT. In this study, 60 mg of selinexor was administered twice weekly until disease progression. The primary endpoint was ORR, and other endpoints included DOR, OS, and safety assessments. For the current analysis, outcomes were assessed in patients <65 versus those \u226565 years old. Results: Of the 134 patients enrolled in the study, 52 (39%) were 65 (3.8% vs. 11.0%). Conclusions: Patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL who were \u226565 years had a similar clinical benefit to those <65 when treated with selinexor, with comparable ORR, CR, PFS, DOR, and safety profile. As expected, younger patients (<65 years old) had a longer overall survival than those \u226565 years old, most likely due to comorbid medical conditions in the patients \u226565 years. These results indicate that selinexor can induce durable responses in younger and older patients with heavily pretreated DLBCL with similar tolerability.
