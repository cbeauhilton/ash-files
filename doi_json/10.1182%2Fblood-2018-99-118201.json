    "abstract_text": "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) may express different inhibitory receptors (IRs) on the cell surface that are exploited by cancer cells to evade the immune attack. Thus, exhausted T cells display an unresponsive functional profile and fail to kill tumor cells. TIM-3 and LAG-3 represent highly expressed inhibitory receptors in exhausted T cells infiltrating solid tumors. We recently showed that a large fraction of bone marrow infiltrating CD8 + cells co-express multiple inhibitory receptors, including TIM-3, in patients with acute myeloid leukemia relapsing after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These observations advocate for strategies to generate innovative tumor-specific T cell products resistant to inhibitory signals and able to persist long-term in treated patients. To reach these objectives we developed a strategy to simultaneously redirect T cell specificity by TCR gene transfer and permanently disrupt IRs by CRISPR/Cas9 system in long-living memory stem T cells (T SCM ) for adoptive cell therapy. Primary T cells were activated with CD3/CD28-conjugated beads and cultured with low doses of IL7 and IL15, to preserve their T SCM phenotype, and electroporated with Cas9/gRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) targeting a coding sequence of TIM-3, LAG3 , 2B4 and of the TCR \u03b1 and \u03b2 chain constant region ( TRAC and TRBC1/2 ) genes. Each gene was edited alone or in combination in a multiplex approach. The efficiencies of NHEJ-mediated inactivation of each gene were assessed by cytofluorimetric analysis and confirmed at molecular level by surveyor assay or ddPCR. In order to avoid mispairing between the endogenous TCR and the tumor-specific TCR, we simultaneously inactivated the constant regions of \u03b1 and \u03b2 chain of the endogenous TCR genes. Efficiency of TRAC and/or TRBC1/2 gene disruption was 98%, when measured as % of CD3 neg cells. TCR knocked-out cells could be efficiently (70-85%) transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding for TCR specific for an HLA-A2 restricted peptide from NY-ESO1. We then focused on IR gene inactivation. Single gene editing produced up to 98%, 93% and 63% genetic knock-out of the TIM-3 , the LAG-3 and the 2B4 genes, respectively. We finally combined one IR inactivation with TCR gene editing in a single protocol. We obtained an average of 68% and 69% of TIM3 neg and LAG3 neg NY-ESO1-TCR redirected T cells, respectively, and more than 90% of edited cells showed a T SCM phenotype. When tested in functional assays, TCR-IR-edited T SCM cells proved highly effective and specific in killing HLA-A2 + NY-ESO1 + multiple myeloma cells. Of notice, TIM-3 neg and LAG-3 neg cells proved more effective in producing IFNg, TNFa and CD107a, once challenged with tumor cells. In conclusion, by combining the versatility of multiplex gene editing by CRISPR/Cas9 with culture conditions designed to engineer T SCM cells, we can generate innovative tumor-specific cellular products redirected against tumor antigens and resistant to inhibitory signals. Ongoing in vivo evaluation of tumor-specific IR disrupted memory stem T cells will be reported and discussed. Disclosures Bonini: Intellia Therapeutics: Research Funding."
