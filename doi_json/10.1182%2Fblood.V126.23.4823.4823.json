    "abstract_text": "The single most frequent chromosomal translocation associated with childhood ALL is the t(12;21) rearrangement that creates a fusion gene between TEL (ETV6) and AML1 (RUNX1) . Although TEL-AML1 + patients have very good prognoses, relapses occur in up to 20% of patients and many patients face long-term side effects of chemotherapy. Recent data has shown that TEL-AML1 has a direct role in inducing signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation in human t(12;21) leukemia. This activation has been shown to transcriptionally induce MYC and is critical for survival of TEL-AML + leukemia cells. Here, we demonstrate that STAT3 also regulates SMAD7 gene expression. SMAD7 is an antagonist of TGF-\u03b2 signaling, functioning through a negative feedback mechanism, but is also known to function in other biological pathways. Interestingly, SMAD7 has also been shown to play a role in promoting self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells. We show that both pharmacological and mechanistic inhibition of STAT3 results in down regulation of SMAD7 gene expression in TEL-AML1 + cell lines. This result was specific to TEL-AML1 + cells and not found in cells of other ALL subtypes. To understand the role played by SMAD7 in TEL-AML1 + cells, we used lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA targeting SMAD7. Interestingly, SMAD7 silencing was found to inhibit proliferation of TEL-AML1 + cell lines, eventually leading to growth arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, we have established that this effect is not mediated through TGF-\u03b2 signalling. This poster highlights the results of RNA-seq performed on TEL-AML1 + cells with SMAD7 knockdown and in vivo xenograft model of SMAD7 shRNA in TEL-AML + ALL.
