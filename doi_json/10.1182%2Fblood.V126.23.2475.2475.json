    "abstract_text": "Introduction Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug (IMID) used to treat Multiple Myeloma (MM). Although a role for cereblon (CRBN)-mediated degradation of Ikaros proteins (IKZF1 and IKZF3) has been shown, the complete molecular and biochemical mechanisms responsible for lenalidomide-mediated anti-MM activity and/or resistance are undiscovered. Therefore, we aimed to analyze whether IMIDs (thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide) are inducing oxidative stress in MM and what determines these drugs varying sensitivity and/or resistance. Methodology Amplex Red Assay has been performed to analyze IMIDs-mediated inhibition of H 2 O 2 decomposition in both, in-vitro and in-vivo assays. Lentiviruses were prepared in 293T cells for CRBN, IgL-\u03bb & IgL-k, and Bim knockdown experiment. Quantification of MM cellular anti-oxidative capacity for determining IMID sensitivity was standardized with H 2 O 2 -mediated oxidation of FADH2 and NAD(P)H. To measure apoptosis and gene expression analysis 10 6 cells were incubated with lenalidomide for 24 to 96 hours before they were examined by annexin-PI and FACS analysis. Gene and protein expression were measured by RT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Results We discovered that IMIDs inhibit peroxidase-mediated decomposition of H 2 O 2 in both, in vitro horseradish peroxidase (HRP) assays and in human MM cell lines (HMCLs). Of the IMIDs analyzed, pomalidomide was the more potent inhibitor. H 2 O 2 treatment effectively degraded IKZF1 and IKZF3 in HMCLs. To confirm the central role of CRBN in IKZF1 and IKZF3 degradation by H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress, we used CRBN knockdown OPM2 isogeneic cells and the CRBN-overexpressing OCIMY-5 cell line. We treated both sets of isogenic cell lines with lenalidomide and H 2 O 2 for 3 hours, and we showed that H2O2 similarly mediates IKZF1 and IKZF3 degradation in a CRBN-dependent fashion. Next, we tested viability of CRBN present and absent cell lines with increasing concentrations of lenalidomide and H2O2 for 3 days. Lenalidomide-induced cytotoxicity was CRBN dependent, but H 2 O 2 was not after 3 days, as shown by MTT assays. The capacity of MM cells to decompose H 2 O 2 was measured via a biochemical test that quantitatively measured cellular anti-oxidative capacity. IMID sensitivity was well correlated with cellular anti-oxidative capacity, likely, cells more efficiently decompose H 2 O 2 was resistant and cells were not sensitive to IMID. This result shows that antioxidant capacity determines lenalidomide sensitivity among HMCLs with similar CRBN protein expression. We discovered that lenalidomide-mediated cytotoxicity in MM was attributable to oxidative damage of intracellular immunoglobulin proteins. By using several sets of isogenic cells lines with and without CRBN expression, we confirmed that lenalidomide treatment caused accumulation of IgL dimers only in CRBN-positive cells. Lenalidomide-induced IgL dimerization lead to decreased secretion and consequent intracellular accumulation of IgL, as evidenced by unchanged IgL mRNA expression, increased total intracellular IgL protein, and decreased secretion of IgL. After 72 hours of lenalidomide treatment we found decreased XBP-1u, increased XBP-1s, and over-expressed GRP78/BiP endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) marker proteins in CRBN positive cells but not in CRBN knock-down cells. We observed Bim requirement, especially BimEL, after lenalidomide treatment in CRBN-positive lenalidomide-sensitive cells. Our data reveals that lenalidomide-mediated; progressive ERS can positively enhance bortezomib-induced apoptosis in an in-vitro MM model. We pretreated MM cells with lenalidomide and then treated them with bortezomib. OPM2 cells pretreated with lenalidomide for 2 days clearly showed increased sensitivity to bortezomib-induced apoptosis compared with cells that were not pretreated. Conclusion IMIDs inhibit H 2 O 2 decomposition. Ikaros protein degradation is a consequence of H 2 O 2 mediated oxidative stress. Therefore, cells producing high H 2 O 2 and with less antioxidative capacity are more sensitive to IMIDs. On the basis of this discovery, we would be able to predict which patients will benefit from IMIDs-mediated therapy and develop new drugs other than IMIDs that can inhibit intracellular H 2 O 2 decomposition in MM. At present, CRBN may be required for IMIDs to effectively inhibit H 2 O 2 decomposition.
