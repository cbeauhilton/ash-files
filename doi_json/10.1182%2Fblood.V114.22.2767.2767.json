This has been achieved in part by the 2008 WHO classification. FC is now included as a co-criterion for diagnosis in the MDS consensus statement (Leuk Res 2007). Our aim was to explore the role of FC as a sensitive and objective tool for assessment of therapeutic efficacy. Patients and Methods: We prospectively and sequentially assessed the utility of FC during therapy, as part of two phase-II clinical trials incorporating 5-Azacytidine/Thalidomide and Lenalidomide/Stem-cell factor, respectively. Four-color FC analysis was performed on bone marrow samples using a defined antibody panel assessing blast and myelomonocytic populations. Antigen maturation patterns were evaluated by two independent assessors, comparing to healthy volunteers and normal patient controls (n=30), and assigned both a Wells FC score (wFCS) from 0\u20138 (Blood 2003) and Stachurski-FC score (sFCS) \u2013 denoted as positive, intermediate or negative for the presence of antigenic aberrancy and/or asynchrony (Leuk Res 2008). Results: 31 patients, 20 males, median age 66 (range: 43\u201389) were included in the analysis. Within this cohort, there have been 112 FC assessments (incorporating both scores for each). There was good correlation of scoring between the 2 independent assessors with concordance of both FCS in 67/112 (61%) of evaluations. With regards to wFCS there was a discrepancy of 1 point between assessors in 38/112 (34%) of evaluations and 2 points in 2 evaluations (1.7%). For sFCS, there was a discrepancy in only 8/112 (7%) assays. WHO categories comprised: RA (n=1), RCMD (7), RAEB-I/II (13), CMML-I/II (4), 5q- (3), MDS-U (1), AML (2). IPSS cytogenetic risk categories: good \u2013 21, intermediate - 4, poor - 4 and 2 non-assessable. According to WHO-Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS), no patient was at very low risk, 8 were low risk, and the majority classified with at least intermediate (n=6), high (n=12) and very high risk (n=6) disease. 30/31 (97%) were transfusion requiring at enrolment (29 red cell, 1 platelet), with median hemoglobin 92g/L (range 61\u2013118), neutrophil count 2.13 (range 0.23\u201342), platelet count 195 (range 7\u2013606) and marrow blasts 6% (range 1\u201328). Pre-treatment median wFCS was 6 (range: 3\u20139); and by sFCS, 24 were positive, 6 intermediate and 1 negative. At trial entry, the WFCS correlated with the percentage of marrow blasts (r=0.483, p=0.006) and the WPSS (r=0.35, p=0.055). 30 patients (97%) have been re-evaluated on therapy; median time to best clinical response (IWG-2008 criteria) was 77 days (range: 27\u2013511), consistent with previous observations (Fenaux et al, Lancet Oncol 2009). Twenty (65%) achieved at least a PR by conventional criteria. Of these, 15 (75%) showed a concordant improvement in FCS (defined as a reduction in points allocated) in either or both of the wFCS and sFCS. Of these 11/15 showed a reduction in the wFCS (median reduction in score 2, range 1\u20133); 4 showed a concordant improvement in the assigned sFCS (from positive to intermediate, n=2; or intermediate to negative, n=2). Of those who achieved a response by conventional criteria, 2 patients showed no change in either FCS's and 3 patients (CR=1; PR=2) showed an increase in both FCS's, suggestive of early progression, 2 of whom have subsequently progressed clinically by conventional criteria. Of the 20 that achieved a response 18 (90%) have had further assessments. 5/18 (28%) have since progressed, with 80% showing concordant FCS deterioration. Of those who maintained stable disease by conventional criteria (10/31), 7 showed improvement in the either or both of the FCS. Two have since progressed and both showed a concordant deterioration in FCS. Conclusions: These data indicate that FC may offer a more subtle and dynamic objective assessment for sequential disease monitoring, and may aid MDS treatment response evaluation. Further large prospective clinical trials utilising immunophenotyping as a co-criterion to measure response are required to validate these findings.
