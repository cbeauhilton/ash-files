    "abstract_text": "Background: The acute and lymphoma subtypes Human T-lymphotropic virus 1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (HTLV-1 ATLL) are frequently characterized by chemo-refractoriness, a generally aggressive clinical course, and poor outcomes. Despite progress in characterizing the disease biology and the development and implementation of newer agents such as mogamulizumab, survival remains poor, especially for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Furthermore, besides these many challenges, there is a paucity of comprehensive published data in Western (i.e. non-Japanese) patients. Methods: In a retrospective analysis, we identified 109 patients with pathologically-confirmed ATLL evaluated at our institution since 2001. 11 were excluded due to lack of clinical follow-up. Patient, disease, and treatment information was extracted for analysis. The International Prognostic Index (IPI) and Prognostic Index for PTCL-U (PIT) were calculated at time of diagnosis. Response rate was calculated based on the best response (CR/PR) during induction, with response retrospectively assessed based on available data using Lugano criteria. Median survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and follow-up using a reverse Kaplan-Meier method, with survival and follow-up as of July 2019 Results: Ninety eight patients were included in our cohort (Table 1); 46 patients (47%) received initial treatment at another institution. The most common ATLL subtypes were lymphoma (n=43, 44%) acute (n=39, 40%), and smoldering/chronic (n=16, 16%). The median age at diagnosis was 53 years (range 30-92) and the median duration of follow-up from diagnosis was 65 months (95% CI: 41 to 178). With a median follow-up in survivors of 41.2 months, 21 patients are alive. The most common cause of death was disease (69/77 patients, 90%). The median overall survival (OS) among all patients was 13.2 months (Figure 1; range 1.3-240). For acute/lymphoma subtype disease, most patients initially received EPOCH/CHOEP (54 patients), CHOP (18 patients), or BV-CHP (3 patients); practice patterns evolved since the late 2000's to include more etoposide and BV-CHP rather than CHOP. Among 76 patients with lymphoma/acute with reviewable restaging information, 30 (40%) achieved CR. For patients with active disease following induction, a variety of subsequent therapies were used, most commonly romidepsin and pralatrexate, each utilized in 15 patients. Of 68 patients considered for transplant (55 saw a transplant physician, 13 had HLA typing sent), 23 patients ultimately underwent transplant, including 5 autologous and 18 alloSCT. Among patients referred who did not undergo transplant (N = 30), the most common reason was disease-related (24 patients, 80%) followed by patient preference (4 patients, 13%). Since 2010, only two patients underwent autoSCT at our center: one experienced primary graft failure necessitating autologous reconstitution and another lacked suitable allograft donor. Most patients, 13/18 (72%), were in CR at time of alloSCT; 11 patients underwent transplant in first remission, 7 at subsequent timepoints. Donor and graft sources included matched related (n=6), one identical twin, matched unrelated (n=2), mismatched related (n=1), mismatched unrelated (n=2), cord blood (n=4) and haploidentical (n=2). Four patients relapsed after autoSCT, 6 patients following alloSCT, and 2 treatment-related deaths occurred post alloSCT. Progression-free and OS at median follow-up of 39.2 months among alloSCT recipients was 60.6% and 64.1%, respectively (Figure 2). Conclusions: We describe the treatment patterns and outcomes for a large series of non-Japanese patients at our center with ATLL. We confirm the poor outcomes with conventional therapy seen in other studies, with only 40% of lymphoma/leukemia subtype patients achieving CR with first-line therapy, and a median OS of 13.2 months among all patients. AlloSCT offers promise as an effective option that achieved durable long-term responses in many patients, yet its applicability is limited by chemorefractory disease. Larger studies are needed to confirm our findings and to identify effective salvage therapies to attain remission and bridge patients to alloSCT. For patients ineligible for alloSCT due to age/comorbidity, lack of suitable donor, or disease refractoriness, novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to improve outcomes.
