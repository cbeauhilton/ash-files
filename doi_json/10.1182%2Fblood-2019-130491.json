    "abstract_text": "Among transplant related complications, graft versus host disease (GvHD) significantly affects survival among patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT). There is limited data on GvHD and its impact on outcomes of aHSCT in patients with thalassemia major (TM). We have reviewed the incidence and outcome of GVHD among patients with TM who underwent aHSCT at our center. All patients with TM undergoing their first aHSCT between January 2007 and December 2017 were included in this analysis. Till 2009, all patients received conditioning with busulfan (16mg/kg over 4 days) with cyclophosphamide (200mg/kg over 4 days). From 2010, most patients received treosulfan (42 G/m 2 over 3 days) with thiotepa (8mg/Kg for one day) and fludarabine (160mg/m 2 over 4 days) based conditioning regimen. All patients receiving busulfan conditioning received bone marrow (BM) as the graft while most patients receiving treosulfan conditioning received mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). GvHD prophylaxis was with short-course methotrexate (10mg/m 2 on day +1, and 7mg/m 2 on days 3, 6 and 11) with cyclosporine. Thymoglobulin was added for matched unrelated donors (MUD). GvHD was prospectively recorded and graded according to the Glucksberg classification. Between January 2007 and December 2017, 363 first transplants were done for patients with TM with HLA identical donors. There were 12(3.3%) class 1, 105(28.9%) class 2 and 246(67.8%) class 3 (Pesaro risk stratification), with 115(46.7%) of the latter being high risk (Vellore risk stratification - BBMT, 2007; 13: 889). The median age was 8 years (range: 1-25) with a male predominance (60%). 331 (91.2%) patients had matched related donors (MRD) and 32 (8.8%) had MUDs. Donor gender was mismatched in 207 (57%) of which 129 (35.5%) were female to male transplants. The graft was obtained from the bone marrow in 137 (37.7%) of whom 53 (38.7%) were class III, and from mobilized peripheral blood in 226 (62.3%) of whom 193 (85.4% were class III. 149 (41%) patients developed GvHD - acute GvHD (aGvHD) in 115 (31.7%) and chronic GvHD (cGvHD) in 80 (22%). aGvHD was grade I in 32 patients (27.8%), grade II in 36patients (31.3%), grade III in 16 patients (13.9%) and grade IV in 25 patients (21.7%), while 6 patients (5.2%) had features of overlap GvHD only (oral lichen planus). First line treatment was with steroids in all patients with grade II and above aGvHD (n=83) with 43 (51.8%) of them responding adequately. There were 37 patients (44.5%) who required various second line agents for aGvHD with 20 (24%) receiving more than one immunosuppressive agent. 20 patients (24%) with persistent aGvHD went on to develop cGvHD. Out of the total of 80 patients with cGvHD, 13 (16.3%) had limited and 67 (83.7%) had extensive cGvHD. 26 patients (32.5%) developed de novo cGvHD, 8 (10%) of them after donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) for potential rejection. The other 46 patients (57.5%) had chronic overlap GvHD following previous aGvHD. Among the different variables evaluated for association with aGvHD (patient/donor age, gender mismatch, MUD vs MRD), none were significant. Among those with MRD, aGVHd occurred in 36/135 patients (26.7%) of patients receiving BM grafts compared to 65/196 patients (33.2%) who received PBSC grafts (p=ns). cGvHD occurred in 23/106 patients (21.7%) in those receiving BM grafts vs 52/171 patients (30.4%) receiving PBSC (p=ns). 30 patients (8.3%) persisted to have cGvHD at last follow-up but only 20 (5.2%) required treatment. Mortality of the whole cohort was 66 (18.2%), out of which 32 (8.8%) were related to GvHD - 24 (6.6%) due to aGvHD and 8 (2.2%) due to cGvHD. At a median follow up of 41 months (range: 0-148), the 5-year and 10-year overall survival (OS) was 81.1\u00b12.1% each for the whole cohort. The 5-year OS of those with grade 2-4 aGvHD was significantly lower than those with grade 0/1 aGvHD (65.7\u00b15.3% vs 85.7\u00b12.2%, p=0.000) [figure 1]. The 5 year OS of those with cGvHD was 88.9% \u00b1 3.8% as compared to those without cGVHD was 96.9% \u00b1 1.2% (P=0.009) [figure 2]. There was no significant difference in OS among those with limited and extensive cGvHD (90.9\u00b13.6% vs 88.4\u00b14.2% (p=ns). Our data shows that, as expected, severe aGvHD and extensive cGvHD significantly lowers survival in patients with TM undergoing aHSCT. However, PBSC graft did not result in higher acute or chronic GVHD compared to BM.
