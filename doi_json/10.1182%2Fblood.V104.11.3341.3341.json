    "abstract_text": "Cytokine mobilized peripheral blood (MPB) has become the preferred allograft source for patients with advanced hematological malignancies. Procurement of MPB currently requires from 5 to 6 days of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration and is associated with some donor morbidity and high cost. Recent studies suggest G-CSF induces mobilization by indirectly targeting the interaction between the chemokine stromal derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and its receptor CXCR-4. Here we report preliminary results using a direct antagonist of the SDF-1/CXCR-4 interaction, AMD3100, as a single agent to procure MPB from allogeneic donors. Two HLA-identical siblings, both males aged 55 and 58, received one or two doses of AMD3100 at 240mcg/kg followed 4 hours later by leukapheresis (LP). After successful collection and a one week washout period, the same donors were re-mobilized using G-CSF at 10mcg/kg/day followed by LP commencing day 5. The target CD34+ cell dose following each agent was >2.0x10e6/kg recipient weight. The results of the mobilizations and allograft composition are presented in the table.

Both donors experienced grade 2 bone pain during G-CSF mobilization. The AMD3100 mobilized cells from donor 1 were transplanted into a 51 year old woman with AML following conditioning with cyclophosphamide (120mg/kg) and total body irradiation (single dose at 550cGy). Single agent cyclosporine was used for GVHD prophylaxis. She engrafted neutrophils >500/ul promptly on day +11 and platelets > 20,000/ul on day +14. A bone marrow biopsy performed on day +30 revealed an overall cellularity of 50% with normal trilineage hematopoiesis and full donor chimerism. By day 30, the peripheral blood CD3 count had reached 531/ul, CD4 count 305/ul, and CD8 count 211/ul. The CD4/8 ratio was 1.4. She is currently being followed as an outpatient and by day +39 is without evidence of GVHD. The allograft from the second donor was not given as the recipient\u2019s disease progressed. This is the first demonstration that a chemokine antagonist can induce the rapid mobilization of a functionally competent hematopoietic allograft without causing significant toxicity. Accrual is ongoing and additional donor/recipient pairs will be presented.",
