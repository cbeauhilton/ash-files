    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Therapeutic intervention aimed at inducing fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression is an effective approach for ameliorating the clinical severity of sickle cell disease (SCD). Hydroxyurea (HU) is the only FDA-approved drug with proven efficacy for inducing HbF in SCD. Recently, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors were shown to reactivate \u03b3-globin gene expression via DNA hypomethylation. However, alternate approaches involve development of small non-coding microRNAs (miR) to silence major repressors of \u03b3-globin transcription. Previous studies from our group showed that miR-29b inhibits DNA methylation by binding the 3' untranslated region of DNMT3A/B (Starlard-Davenport A et al., J Carcinog 12:15; 2013). Subsequent, studies demonstrated that increased levels of miR-29b are associated with high HbF levels in patients with SCD. To gain insights into mechanisms, studies performed in KU812 cells demonstrated DNMT3A/B silencing with \u04af-globin gene activation. Moreover, miR29b increased HbF expression in erythroid progenitors generated from normal adult CD34 + stem cells (Starlard-Davenport A et al., Br J Haematol 186:91-100; 2019). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that miR-29b activates \u03b3-globin transcription via DNA hypomethylation in normal and sickle erythroid progenitors and Townes SCD mouse model. Methods: Normal CD34 + cells (n=3) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n=2) isolated from SCD patients, were cultured using a two-phase erythroid culturing system. Cells were electroporated with miR-29b mimic (50nM and 100nM) or negative Scrambled (Scr) control on day 8 and collected after 24 h. Erythroid differentiation was assessed using Giemsa staining, and flow cytometry was used to measure the % HbF positive cells (F-cells). Real-time PCR was used to quantify expression of miR-29b, \u03b3-globin, and \u03b2-globin genes, and Western blot was performed to measure DNMT, HbF and HbS protein levels. In vivo studies were performed in Townes SCD mice (3 per group) treated for 28 days by continuous infusion with subcutaneous mini-osmotic pumps. The treatment groups included miR-29b (2mg/kg/day and 3mg/kg/day) and corresponding doses of Scr control mimics. Results: We observed erythroid differentiation of untreated normal and SCD erythroid progenitors at day 7, 12, and 14 of culture assessed by Giemsa stain. Treatment with miR-29b increased the \u04af/\u04af+\u03b2 mRNA ratio by 2.5\u2010fold (p85% increase in %F-cells compared to Scr cells. Subsequent miR-29b treatment was conducted for 28 days in Townes SCD mice, which was well tolerated documented by good weight gain and no deaths. There were minimal effects on hematopoiesis with a decrease in total white blood count and an increase in neutrophils. Total hemoglobin, reticulocyte and platelet counts remained stable. By week 4, we observed a 0.5 fold and 2.3-fold (p<0.005) increase in %F-cells at the 2mg/kg and 3 mg/kg miR-29b doses respectively compared to corresponding Scr controls. By week 4, miR29b increased HbF levels 2.1-fold by Western blot, and sickle cell levels under hypoxic conditions decreased 32% (p<0.01). Conclusions: Our findings support the ability of miR-29b to induce HbF in normal and sickle erythroid progenitors without significant toxicity in vitro and in SCD mice in vivo . This research highlights a novel miRNA-based epigenetic approach to induce HbF supporting discovery of new drugs to expand treatment options for SCD. Disclosures Pace:  Imara Inc.: Consultancy.",
