Methods: The real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RQ-PCR)technique was used to detect the mRAN expression levels of HGF, SDF-1, CCL2 and IL-8 in bone marrow MSC from 20 newly diagnosed MM patients compared with 9 controls. Results: The results indicated that the mean mRNA expression level of HGF was up-regulated in MM patients, as compared with control (P < 0.01). However, the mean mRNA expression level of SDF-1 mRNA was down-regulated in MM patients, as compared with control (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the mRNA expression levels of CCL2 and IL-8 between MM and control cohorts (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The research suggests that multiple chemotaxis-related factors expression of bone marrow microenvironment cellular component are dysrelugulated in MM patients, which might result from the interplay between MM cell and MSC.
