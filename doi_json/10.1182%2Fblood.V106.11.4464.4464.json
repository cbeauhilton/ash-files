    "abstract_text": "Proteasome inhibitors block degradation of the NF-\u03baB regulator, I\u03baB, resulting in inhibition of NF-\u03baB nuclear localization. Proteasome inhibitors have been tested in the setting of refractory acute leukemia, with proteasome inhibition demonstrated within leukemic blasts. Arsenic trioxide (AsO 3 ) has also been shown to inhibit NF-\u03baB in leukemia. Since NF-\u03baB is constitutively activated in primitive AML cells and serves as a regulator of many genes which encode proliferative and survival responses, we have begun to explore the effects of AsO 3 and bortezomib (PS-341, Velcade TM ), on AML cell lines and primary cells. The farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) also inhibit AML proliferation, and their effects in combination with bortezomib have also been explored. Because FTIs may inhibit signal transduction pathways independent of those affected by NF-\u03baB inhibition, and because FTIs may indirectly inhibit NF-\u03baB function via Akt inhibition, the effects of combining these agents with other NF-\u03baB agents on AML cells in vitro have also been explored. Bortezomib, at concentrations of 4nM or greater, inhibited NF-\u03baB in AML cell lines and primary cells as did AsO 3 at concentrations of 1 nM or greater. NF-kappa B was measured by ELISA for p65 NF-\u03baB activity. The nonpeptidomimetic FTI, R115777 (J&J), did not inhibit NF-\u03baB at concentrations up to 100 nM, concentrations which effectively inhibit farnesylation of target proteins, whereas the FTI, L-744832 (Merck), was able to inhibit NF-\u03baB expression at 1 \u03bcM from 24 to 72 hours of exposure. In the HL60 cell line, inhibited by FTI and bortezomib independently, the combination did not appear to have additive or synergistic effects. Furthermore, the effects of combined exposure to FTI and bortezomib on expression of activated caspase 3 or activated PARP cleavage were no greater than with bortezomib alone. Likewise, combination effects on expression of phosphorylated AKT or ERK were not observed. In contrast, the combination of bortezomib and AsO 3 resulted in decreased phospho-ERK expression and increased expression of cleaved PARP, suggesting increased apoptosis. When cytarabine, 100 nM was combined with bortezomib at 1 to 4 nM, no effect on timing of administration was noted, and apoptosis was increased with the combination as evidenced by an increase in cleaved PARP expression. Greater inhibition of proliferation was seen with this combination than with individual agents as demonstrated in MTT assays with combination index calculations suggesting synergism. With this combination, co-culture with an endothelial monolayer did not prevent the increased apoptosis noted with combined cytarabine and bortezomib. These studies suggest that future studies combining proteasome inhibition with standard chemotherapeutic agents or with other inhibitors of NF-\u03baB like Arsenic trioxide may have greater antileukemic activity by inducing apoptosis in AML cells in vivo as well as in vitro, without obvious limitations of other targeted agents and drugs that are extruded by multridrug resistance transporters.",
