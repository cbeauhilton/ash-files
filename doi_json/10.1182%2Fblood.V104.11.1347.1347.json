    "abstract_text": "Bisphosphonates (BPs), widely used to treat bone diseases, have recently been attracted much interest for their antitumor activity and have been reported to exert direct antitumor effects on several cancer cell lines via the inactivation of Ras proteins. BPs inhibit farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthetase in the mevalonate pathway and deplete cellular pools of PPs such as farnesyl PP and geranylgeranyl PP which are indispensable for the activation of Ras proteins. In addition to their direct antitumor activity, BPs expand \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells which are potent effector cells and also induce the accumulation of isopentenyl PP as a tumor antigen in target cancer cells. The purpose of this study was to clarify the cytotoxic activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells expanded ex vivo by the potent third generation BP zoledronate (ZOL). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of five healthy donors were incubated with different concentrations of ZOL and interleukin-2. After 14 days incubation, 1 \u03bcM ZOL increased the absolute number of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells 500\u2013800 fold. Expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells were of the V\u03b39V\u03b42 subset and cytokine levels of IL-2, -4, -5, -10, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 were not elevated at resting i.e. before contact to target cancer cells. In vitro cytotoxic activities of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells against the luciferase-labeled small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line SBC-5 were examined by a newly developed cytotoxic assay using an in vivo imaging system (Xenogen, Alameda, CA) and video microscopy, Leica AS MDW (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL). \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells killed SBC-5 cells pre-treated with 5 \u03bcM ZOL for 12 h after 1.5\u20133.0 h contact with the target cells whereas untreated SBC-5 were rarely killed. SBC-5 cells pretreated with 5 \u03bcM ZOL showed a marked increase in their sensitivity to lysis by \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells, percentages of specific lysis were 42% and 55% at effector/target (E/T) ratios of 5:1 and 10:1, respectively, while those of untreated SBC-5 cells were 8% and 13% at E/T ratios of 5:1 and 10:1, respectively. In vivo efficacy of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells was investigated in mice xenografted subcutaneously with SBC-5 cells. Pretreatment with 80 \u03bcg/kg ZOL enhanced significantly antitumor activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells also in vivo . These findings showed that ZOL stimulated the proliferation of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells significantly and that the cytotoxic activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells required pre-treatment of target cells with ZOL, indicating the potential use of autologous ex vivo expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells for cancer immunotherapy."
