    "abstract_text": "Idiopathic autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction. The major platelet antigens that autoantibodies are directed against in ITP are GPIIbIIIa and GPIb\u03b1. Intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) is a treatment used in ITP; however, some patients are refractory to this treatment and the mechanisms of action of IVIG in this disease are not fully understood. We tested the hypothesis that IVIG may not be equally effective in preventing ITP caused by GPIIbIIIa versus GPIb\u03b1 anti-platelet antibodies. Thrombocytopenia was induced in Balb/c mice using three monoclonal antibodies against either mouse platelet GPIIbIIIa (JON1, 2, \u22123) or against GPIb\u03b1 (p0p 3, 4, \u22125). Mouse platelet counts were performed daily from day one (pre-treatment) until day five using a flow cytometric assay. The efficacy of IVIG in inhibiting monoclonal antibody-induced platelet destruction in mice was assessed by intraperitoneal injection of IVIG (2 g/kg) 24-hours before anti-platelet antibody injections (7 mg/mouse, i.v.) on day two. We found that pre-treatment with IVIG resulted in a significantly higher platelet count on day three in all groups of anti-GPIIbIIIa-injected animals (n=3/antibody; for JON1, P=0.002; JON2, P=0.015; JON3, P=0.002) as compared to albumin-treated controls. In contrast, IVIG failed to prevent platelet clearance and thrombocytopenia on day three in two anti-GPIb\u03b1 antibody-treated groups (p0p3 and p0p5, n=3/antibody), but did inhibit platelet destruction in mice that were injected with p0p4 antibody (P=0.0003). Our results indicate that the efficacy of IVIG treatment in preventing ITP induced by these anti-platelet antibodies is affected by their antigen specificities. These data also suggest that patients with ITP mediated by GPIb\u03b1 may be less responsive to IVIG treatment than those with ITP mediated by GPIIbIIIa antibodies.",
