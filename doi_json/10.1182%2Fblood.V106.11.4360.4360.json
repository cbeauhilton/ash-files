    "abstract_text": "Objective: to explore genes related to the prognosis of AML (M 2a ). Methods: 6 newly diagnosed AML were involved in this experiment and were divided into 2 groups. Group A: 3 AML (M 2a ) patients with continuous complete remission (CCR 1 ) less than 6 months; Group B: 3 AML (M 2a ) patients with CCR 1 more than 12 months. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were separated and mRNA was purified and labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 respectively, which were used to hybridize against the Agilent human 1B 60mer oligonucleotide microarrays. Results: in the 20173 genes tested, 22 genes were found to be expressed differently between these two groups, among them 10 genes were up-regulated in group A, and 12 genes were up-regulated in group B. Conclusion: with microarray assay, 22 genes including APP were found to be differently expressed in AML (M 2a ) treated with standard chemotherapy. These genes may be early indicators for the diagnosis as well as prognosis of the refractory AML.",
