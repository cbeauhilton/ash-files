    "abstract_text": "Over the last three decades there has been improvement in survival in children with sickle cell disease. Overall survival from birth to age 18 of 86% and 95% has been reported in children with sickle cell anemia (HbSS) and sickle hemoglobin C (Hb SC) disease respectively. These encouraging results are secondary to initiation of preventive measures like newborn screening, penicillin prophylaxis, immunization and stroke prevention and other supportive therapies. Ballas ( Blood  2004 ; 104 supl:Abstr 3743 ) reported high death rate for young adults with the disease. To determine the death rates and cause of death in our population, we did a retrospective review of our patients who had recently transitioned into adult care. Mortality rate and circumstances of death in a 10 year period of transition from pediatric to adult program in Georgia Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center at Grady Memorial Hospital between 1996 and 2006 were determined. Total number of deaths was obtained from the clinical database. Death, autopsy and medical records were reviewed to determine the cause and circumstances of death. Between 1996 and 2006, 387 young adults with sickle cell disease (HbSS, HbSC, HbS beta thalassemia) transitioned to the adult program at age 18. Twenty two (5.8%) patients died during their first 10 years of transition. Mean age at death was 23.4 (range 21.6\u201326) and male to female ratio was 1.2 to 1. Ten patients (45%) died due to chronic organ failure all due to chronic iron overload (end stage liver disease in 8 and congestive heart failure in 2). Eight patients (36%) died due to complications of acute vaso-occlusive crisis (sudden death in 4, acute chest/multi-organ failure in 4) while 4 patients (18%) died of non-sickle related causes. Three of four who died of sudden death has documented pulmonary hypertension. Our mortality rate is lower than those reported by Ballas with the most common cause of death being complications of iron overload in chronically transfused patients. Specific interventions targeted at improving management of iron overload need to be developed for the increasing numbers of patients on chronic transfusion transitioning into adult care."
