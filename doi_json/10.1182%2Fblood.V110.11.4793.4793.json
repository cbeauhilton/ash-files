    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma is an incurable malignancy of plasma cells homing to the bone marrow. Myeloma cells are dependent on factors in their microenvironment for survival and expansion. HGF may be produced both by myeloma cells and the bone marrow microenvironment and serum levels of HGF are known to be a prognostic factor in multiple myeloma. Both IL-6 and IGF-1 are known growth factors for myeloma cells. In the human myeloma cell line (HMCL) INA-6, HGF alone had low effect, but together with IL-6 and IGF-1 it became a potent growth factor increasing thymidin incorporation two- to three-fold above the levels obtained with IL-6 or IGF-1 alone. Similar results were obtained for the myeloma cell line OH-2. The ANBL-6 cell line harbours an autocrine growth promoting HGF-loop. When inhibiting this autocrine HGF loop with a specific c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (PHA-665752), IL-6- and IGF-1-induced proliferation was reduced by 80% and 50% respectively. Thus, in the prescence of HGF, both IL-6 and IGF-1 are dependent on the HGF-receptor c-Met for full effect on cell proliferation. There seems to be two interconnected explanations for the synergy between HGF- and either IL-6- or IGF-1-signalling in myeloma cells. IL-6 and IGF-1 treatment increased the expression of c-Met in INA-6 cells Secondly, we found that HGF was unique among the three growth factors in activating both Ras and p44/42 MAPK in INA-6 cells. Also in ANBL-6 cells, IGF and IL-6 was dependent on functional c-Met signalling to fully activate this pathway. Thus, the reason for synergy between HGF and IL-6 or IGF-1 seemed to be that full activation of the Ras-Mapk pathway through Gab1 and SHP-2 by these cytokines was dependent on operating c-Met signalling. Taken together, HGF and c-Met signalling would be attractive targets for therapy of multiple myeloma.",
