    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1601 Objective: The dysfunction of human diabetic CD34 + endothelial progenitor cells limits their utility in autologous cell therapy for vascular complications. Previously, we showed that transient inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) enhances vascular reparative function of human CD34 + cells isolated from diabetics (Bhatwadekar et al, 2010). Expression of PAI-1, the major gene product of TGF-\u03b21 activation, is increased by high glucose and insulin exposure in endothelial cells and PAI-1 has been shown to be increased in the serum of diabetics. We asked whether the beneficial effects of TGF-\u03b21 blockade on CD34 + cells function were mediated by inhibition of PAI-1 and whether blocking of PAI-1 could correct diabetes associated dysfunction of these cells. Research Design and Methods: Plasma determinations of PAI-1 and TGF-\u03b21 (both measured by ELISA) were compared in type 2 (n=17) and type 1 (n=7) diabetic patients. CD34 + cells from these individuals were isolated and analyzed for cell survival (in the presence and absence of growth factors), cell proliferation, cell cycle analysis and migration. The effect of TGF-\u03b21 phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) treatment on PAI-1 level was determined in CD34 + cells. In CD34 + cells, PAI-1 was blocked using either lentivirus expressing PAI-1 shRNA or PAI-1 siRNA. In vivo homing ability of PAI-1 inhibited CD34 + cells was assessed using an ocular model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) Injury. Results: Plasma PAI-1 level was increased in type 2 diabetic patients compared to type 1 (p<0.05) and directly correlated with TGF-\u03b21 plasma levels (r= 0.44). TGF-\u03b21 PMO treatment resulted in a reduction of PAI-1 mRNA expression (p=0.0018 in diabetic, p=0.05 in non-diabetic). PAI-1 blockade promoted EPC proliferation in vitro and bypassed the inhibitory effect of TGF-\u03b21 on cell survival (p<0.001) even in the absence of growth factors. PAI-1 blockade enhanced the migration of these cells in response to SDF-1\u03b1 in (p<0.01) compared to cells treated with scrambled siRNA and improved the in vivo re-endothelialization by CD34 + cells in the I/R model. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the cytostatic activity of TGF-\u03b21 in CD34 + cells is mediated largely through PAI-1. Blocking PAI-1 corrects multiple defects in CD34 + cells from type 2 diabetic patients. This approach may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for restoring vascular reparative function in diabetic cells and facilitate their use in autologous cell therapy.
