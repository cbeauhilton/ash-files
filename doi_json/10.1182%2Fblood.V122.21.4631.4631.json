    "abstract_text": "Background Palifermin has been shown to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in hematological stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. A follow-up study was performed to rule out a potential long-term safety risk of palifermin use. Objectives to compare long-term disease outcome (overall survival, disease progression and incidence of secondary malignancies) between palifermin and placebo. Methods This is a long-term follow-up study of patients with hematological malignancies undergoing HSCT and treated with palifermin or placebo to prevent oral mucositis. The aim of the study was to detail any potential late complications due to palifermin exposure. Patients were enrolled between 1997-2003 into four randomized, placebo-controlled phase II/III studies conducted at 31 sites in Australia, Europe and the US. The survival outcomes were compared using hazard ratios (HRs) estimated with Cox model including the treatment group, baseline age, disease type (Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, leukemia), ECOG performance status, country and presence of prior radiotherapy as covariates. The incidence of secondary malignancies was compared with chi-squared test. Results A total of 672 patients were randomized to the parent studies (429 palifermin, 243 placebo) and 543 (345, 198) were enrolled to the long-term follow-up. The median follow-up time for subjects alive was 7.9 years (range 0.1-14.9) for palifermin and 8.8 (0.1-14.8) for placebo. No significant differences were seen for either overall survival (HR = 1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-1.31; p=0.921) or progression-free survival (HR=1.04; 95% CI 0.83-1.31; p=0.733). Secondary malignancies were reported by 13% (palifermin) vs. 11% (placebo) of the patients (p=0.477). The most common secondary malignancies were acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (5% vs. 5%) and skin cancers (2% vs. 2%). Conclusion The overall survival, progression-free survival, and the incidence of secondary malignancies were comparable between palifermin and placebo in patients undergoing HSCT. After a follow-up of up to 15 years, no negative effect of palifermin on long-term outcomes was observed. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
