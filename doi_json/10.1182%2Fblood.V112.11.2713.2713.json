    "abstract_text": "The long term generation of protective antibodies (Abs) requires the continuous survival of long-lived plasma cells that are maintained within specialized bone marrow niches by complex interactions that remain largely uncharacterized. Previous studies have shown that the T cell costimulatory receptor CD28 is expressed on normal and transformed (murine plasmacytoma, human multiple myeloma) plasma cells \u2013 however, its role in the B cell lineage remained unclear. We have recently shown that CD28 expressed on transformed human plasma cells (multiple myeloma cells) directly delivers pro-survival signals to the myeloma cells and protects them against intrinsically and extrinsically induced death (Bahlis et al , 2007). Furthermore, myeloma cells directly interact with dendritic cells (DC, both in vitro and in patient bone marrow biopsies), and the DC provide the ligands (i.e. CD80 and CD86) for myeloma-CD28. Others studies utilizing competitive bone marrow reconstitution have indirectly suggest a role for CD28 in the function and/or survival of normal murine plasma cells (Delogu et al , 2006). These observations led us to directly investigate the role of CD28 in normal plasma cell survival as well as cell-cell interactions with CD80/CD86 + bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC). In vitro serum starvation experiments, direct activation of CD28 by an agonistic anti-CD28 mAb increased survival of serum-starved PC by 63% (p<0.001). Addition of BMDC improved the survival of PC by 20% over that seen with media alone, and resulted in a significant increase in IgG production (p<0.01). We and others have shown that CD28 binding to CD80/CD86 on DC also \u201cbacksignals\u201d to the DC to produce the PC survival factor IL-6. We found that co-culture with the murine plasmacytoma cell line S194 induced 155 pg/ml of IL-6 from BMDC (p<0.01 vs. BMDC alone and S194 alone), and primary plasma cells isolated from bone marrow induced 290 pg/ml of IL-6 from BMDC (p<0.001 vs. BMDC alone). Induction of BMDC production of IL-6 by both primary and transformed PC was significantly inhibited (p<0.05) by antibody blockade of CD80 and CD86. Our data demonstrates that signaling through CD28 directly supports the survival of normal bone marrow plasma cells, and that \u201cbacksignaling\u201d through PC-CD28 engagement of DC-CD80/CD86 induces DC to secrete the pro-survival cytokine IL-6. These findings suggest that CD28 is a key molecular bridge that connect normal plasma cells to the supportive microenvironment.",
