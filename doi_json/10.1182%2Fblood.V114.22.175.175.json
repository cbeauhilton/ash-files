    "abstract_text": "Abstract 175 Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by anemia usually presenting during infancy or in early childhood, birth defects, and increased risk of cancer. Although anemia is the most prominent feature of DBA, the disease is also characterized by growth retardation and congenital malformations, in particular craniofacial, upper limb, heart and urinary system defects, that are present in \u223c30\u201350% of patients. To date, DBA has been associated with mutations in seven ribosomal protein (RP) genes, S19, S24, S17, L35A, L5, L11, and S7 in about \u223c43% of patients. To complete our large scale screen of RP genes in a DBA population, we sequenced 49 ribosomal protein genes in our DBA patient cohort of 117 probands. Together with our previous efforts of screening 29 RP genes, this completes the analysis of all known RP genes (excluding RPS4Y on the Y chromosome). Here we report probable mutations in four more RP genes, RPS10, RPS26, RPL19 , and RPL26 , and variants of unknown significance in six more, RPL9, RPL14, RPL23A, RPL7, RPL35 , and RPL3 . RPS10 and RPS26 are now confirmed DBA genes as we identified five mutations in RPS10 in five probands and nine mutations in RPS26 in 12 probands. We found single small frameshifting deletions in RPL19 and RPL26 in single DBA families. Pre-rRNA analysis in lymphoblastoid cells from patients bearing mutations in RPS10 and RPS26 showed elevated levels of 18S-E pre-rRNA. This accumulation is consistent with the phenotype observed in HeLa cells after knock-down of RPS10 or RPS26 expression with siRNAs, which indicate that mutations in the RPS10 and RPS26 genes in DBA patients affect the function of the proteins. This brings to 11, the total number of RP genes mutated in \u223c54% of patients with DBA, with nine more genes harboring variants of unknown significance requiring further study.
