    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3637 The NF-\u03baB transcription factors are involved in inflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The p50:p65 heterodimer, the most common transcription activating form of NF-\u03baB, is retained in the cytosol and translocates into the nucleus only upon stimulation. In contrast, the p50 homodimer is the primary nuclear NF-\u03baB species in unstimulated cells, and recruit HDACs to repress NF-\u03baB-target gene expression. Dysregulation of NF-\u03baB frequently occurs in AML and lymphoma. C/EBP\u03b1 is mutated in approximately 10% of patients with AML, resulting in expression of C/EBP\u03b1p30 or C/EBP\u03b1LZ oncoproteins. We showed that C/EBP\u03b1 or its oncoproteins, including leucine zipper variants (C/EBP\u03b1LZ) that cannot bind DNA directly, protects hematopoietic cells from apoptosis. Through interaction with NF-\u03baB p50, C/EBP\u03b1 or its AML mutants activate several anti-apoptotic genes including BCL2 and FLIP . C/EBP\u03b2 or its truncated LIP isoform are over-expressed in Hodgkin lymphoma and breast cancer. Using Ba/F3 cell lines carrying an estrogen receptor fusion of C/EBP\u03b1 or C/EBP\u03b1LZ, we now show that activation of C/EBP\u03b1 isoforms results in a significant 90% reduction in the association of endogenous HDAC1 or HDAC3 with the FLIP promoter, within 5 hours. In contrast, activation of the basic region mutant C/EBP\u03b1BR that cannot bind p50 did not have an effect. Accordingly, ChIP analysis demonstrated that on the FLIP promoter, the expression of C/EBP\u03b1 or C/EBP\u03b1LZ resulted in a 2.5 or 4-fold increase in histone H3 or H4 acetylation, respectively. To study the specific displacement of HDACs from p50 we used E\u03bc-C/EBP\u03b1 transgenic mice which express C/EBP\u03b1 in splenic lymphoid cells, in contrast to control littermates. The ectopic presence of C/EBP\u03b1 resulted in a significant reduction of endogenous HDAC1 or HDAC3 on the FLIP promoter to 17 or 4% of the expression in wild type mice. In contrast, in p50-/- mice, the C/EBP\u03b1 transgene had a minimal effect on HDAC1 or a modest reduction of HDAC3 occupancy on the FLIP promoter, to 90 or 50% of levels seen in p50-/- controls. These findings suggest that on the FLIP promoter C/EBP\u03b1 displaces primarily p50-bound HDACs. HDAC1 or HDAC3 co-ip with p50 in transiently transfected 293T cells. The co-expression of C/EBP\u03b1, its C/EBP\u03b1LZ or C/EBP\u03b1p30 AML mutants, or C/EBP\u03b2 interrupted interaction of p50 with HDAC1 and to a lesser extent with HDAC3. In striking correlation to our previous findings, the basic region mutant C/EBP\u03b1BR does not interrupt this interaction. As a control, we confirmed that C/EBP\u03b1 or C/EBP\u03b2 do not disrupt the NF-\u03baB p50:p65 co-ip. We have shown that interaction with p50 is required for induction of bcl-2 and FLIP by C/EBP\u03b1 and that p50 binds and induces the CEBPA gene. Using ChIP analysis, we now show that in U937 AML cells endogenous C/EBP\u03b1, C/EBP\u03b2 and p50 specifically bind the proximal segment of the nfkb1 (p50) promoter. In addition, C/EBP\u03b1LZ expressed from the metallothionein promoter in Ba/F3 cells binds a proximal site in the nfkb1 promoter. C/EBP\u03b1 or C/EBP\u03b1LZ induced p50 RNA expression 3.5-fold, while C/EBP\u03b1BR was not effective. Treating the cells with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide did not change p50 induction, suggesting direct activation. C/EBP\u03b1, C/EBP\u03b1LZ but not C/EBP\u03b1BR activated to a similar degree luciferase reporters containing 1800 or 250 bp fragments of the nfkb1 promoter. In addition, C/EBP\u03b2 or its truncated LIP isoform activated these reporters, although LIP cannot activate a (CEBP) 2 TK-Luc reporter. The murine nfkb1 promoter contains 2 proximal \u03baB sites that are 100% conserved between mouse and human. p50 but not C/EBP avidly binds either of these sites in a gel shift assay. Disruption of either \u03baB site abrogated 65 to 80% of reporter activation, and mutating both resulted in activation of less than 10% by either C/EBP\u03b1 or C/EBP\u03b1LZ. In summary, we show that C/EBPs displace HDAC from NF-\u03baB p50, providing a mechanism whereby C/EBP\u03b1 or its AML mutants can derepress NF-\u03baB target genes and contribute to their dysregulated expression. In addition, C/EBP\u03b1, a C/EBP\u03b1LZ AML variant that cannot bind DNA directly, or C/EBP\u03b2 bind and activate the nfkb1 promoter through interaction with NF-\u03baB bound to two proximal, highly conserved \u03baB sites. Together these findings lend support to the idea that disrupting the C/EBP:NF-\u03baB p50 complex may offer a complementary approach for targeting NF-\u03baB activity in the nucleus to favor apoptosis in AML or other malignancies in which C/EBP family members are expressed.
