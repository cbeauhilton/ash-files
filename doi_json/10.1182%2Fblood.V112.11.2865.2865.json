    "abstract_text": "When platelets are chilled for short times (48 h-refrigerated) (Wandall et al. Blood, 2008). Investigating the clearance mechanism of 48 h-refrigerated platelets, we now demonstrate macrophage-independent hepatic removal, that is mediated by the Ashwell-Morell asialoglycoprotein receptor (AMR). This conclusion is based on the following evidence: macrophage depletion in mice using clodronate encapsulated liposomes, a procedure that dramatically improves the circulation of 4 h chilled platelets, does not prevent the clearance of 48 h chilled platelets; streptavidin-POD staining reveals abundant long-term refrigerated and biotinylated platelets in hepatocytes; 48 h-refrigeration increases by ~1.7-fold the binding of the \u03b2galactose-recognizing lectin RCA, but not of the \u03b2GlcNAc recognizing lectin sWGA lectin to platelets; KO mice lacking Asgr-1 or Asgr-2 subunits of the AMR support 48 h-refrigerated platelet circulation times comparable to room temperature stored platelets; Co-injection of asialofetuin, a competitive inhibitor of the asialoglycoprotein-receptors, restore the survival of 48 h-refrigerated platelets in WT mice; and hepatocyte HepG2 cells ingest fluorescently labeled long-term refrigerated platelets in culture, and asialofetuin prevents this ingestion. Regarding the platelet target of the Asgr-1/Asgr-2 receptors, circulation of 48 h-refrigerated platelets is markedly improved by removal of GPIb\u03b1\u2019s N-T domain using O-sialopeptidase. We conclude that longterm refrigeration exposes galactose residues on GPIb\u03b1 subunits of platelets to generate ligands recognized by hepatocyte Ashwell-Morell receptors."
