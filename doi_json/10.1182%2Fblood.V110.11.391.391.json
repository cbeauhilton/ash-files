    "abstract_text": "We have conducted systematic small interfering RNA (siRNA) lethality screening of the kinome and \u201cdruggable genome\u201d in human myeloma cell lines (HMCL) to functionally generate a comprehensive map of critical genes and vulnerabilities in human myeloma tumors. KMS11 human myeloma cells were screened with both an 1800 oligo (639 gene) siRNA library targeting the kinome and with a 13,984 oligo (6,791 gene) library targeting the druggable genome in duplicate using optimized conditions that resulted in >95% transfection efficiency and 50 somatic tissues in which they are absent or only weakly expressed. The extent to which the kinome vulnerabilities identified in KMS11 occur in other HMCL was assessed by tertiary siRNA screening and by lentiviral shRNA techniques. More than 75% of kinases vulnerable in KMS11 cells are recurrently vulnerable in other myeloma tumor lines. Secondary validation studies of all genomic vulnerabilities identified from the much larger siRNA lethality screen of the druggable genome in myeloma cells is ongoing, however, to date 134 genes have been validated as essential myeloma survival factors during primary screening by concordant lethality of 2/2 independent siRNA (compared with an expected rate due to chance of n<1 genes). Significantly, proteosome subunits and specific ubiquitin ligases number amongst the most potently lethal genomic vulnerabilities in KMS11. Overall, this attempt to systematically and functionally document all genetic vulnerabilities in myeloma provides a strong rational impetus for the development of novel therapies that optimally target susceptibilities inherent within myeloma tumors."
