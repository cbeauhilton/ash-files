    "abstract_text": "Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) type II is the most frequent type of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia; it is transmitted in an autosomal recessive fashion and is characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, peripheral hemolysis, bi-multinuclearity in the erythroblasts, and hypoglycosylation of red blood cell (RBC) membrane proteins such as band 3. The disease is generally caused by biallelic mutations in the SEC23B gene. However, there are a small portion of patients with clinical and hematologic features of CDA II that are negative for mutations in SEC23B , suggesting that alternative etiologies for such disturbed erythropoiesis exist. We identified two siblings of Italian origin who had dyserythropoiesis with a chronic macrocytic anemia. Their parents were healthy with normal hematologic parameters. No history of consanguinity for at least three generations was noted. The affected siblings had anisopoikylocytosis on peripheral blood smear with stomatocytes (8-9%), spherocytes (4-5%), rare ovalocytes, and dacryocytes. RBCs osmotic fragility was increased but the red cells had normal eosin-5-maleimide (EMA)-binding. Serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were increased in only one sibling. Bone marrow morphology revealed erythroid hyperplasia (myeloid: erythroid ratio = 0.6) with binuclearity and megaloblastic changes, as well as occasional cytoplasmic bridging between cells at different stage of maturation; electron microscopy of bone marrow erythroblasts showed multiple membranes that ran parallel to the plasma membrane or that were grouped in stacked segments, possibly attributable to residual endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisternae. SDS-PAGE analysis of RBC ghosts from both siblings demonstrated hypoglycosylation of band 3 and GLUT1, as well as residual residual Protein Disulphide Isomerase (PDI) positive ER remnants, as observed in classical CDA II cases. However, in contrast to CDAII, the Ham's test performed with 15 normal serum samples was negative, and no mutations were detected in the SEC23B gene. To uncover the underlying etiologies, whole-exome sequencing was conducted on all available family members. After filtering for common variants, only a single gene had biallelic mutations in the affected siblings, which were transmitted from the unaffected heterozygous parents. The identified mutations resided in the PARP4 gene, which encodes a poly-ADP ribose polymerase enzyme, and were predicted to be deleterious. We demonstrate that knockdown of PARP4 using shRNA in primary human erythroid progenitors results in impaired erythroid differentiation and increased apoptosis. In addition, morpholino-mediated knockdown of the PARP4 orthologue in the zebrafish resulted in dyserythropoiesis and anemia in developing embryos. Sequencing of PARP4 in additional rare cases of CDA II without an identified molecular basis will help to uncover the frequency and spectrum of PARP4 mutations leading to dyserythropoiesis. The finding of a new gene implicated in a similar type of CDA with features such as redundant ER membranes offers the potential for more mechanistic dissection of the role of both SEC23B and PARP4 in erythroid development and suggests that new insight can be gained into the underlying pathophysiology of both normal and disordered erythropoiesis through the study of such rare cases.
