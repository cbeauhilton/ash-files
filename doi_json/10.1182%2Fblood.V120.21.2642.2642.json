    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2642 Introduction With the aging of the population clinicians are increasingly confronted with elderly, often frail, patients with a DLBCL. While the very elderly patients, defined by the age of \u226575 year, are often excluded from clinical trials, only few prospective data in the rituximab-era are available on the outcome in this patient cohort. To asses efficacy, tolerability and safety of standard intensive rituximab-containing therapy in those patients, a descriptive population-based, cohort study was performed. Detailed information on treatment, toxicity and outcome in all patients aged \u226575 year, diagnosed with DLBCL in the Dutch province Friesland was prospectively gathered and analyzed. Methods Since 2005 all patients diagnosed with a haematological malignancy in Friesland, a province with 600.000 inhabitants, are prospectively registered and followed in a population-based registry, the Hemobase R . For this analysis data of all patients aged \u2265 75 years with a newly diagnosed DLBCL over a period of six years were retrieved from the Hemobase R . Data of clinical characteristics, treatment and its adaptations, treatment-related toxicity and outcome were obtained. Treatment modality was divided in four groups: R-CHOP chemotherapy, other rituximab-containing therapy, palliative radiotherapy and only supportive care. Follow-up was completed until 31 December 2011. Cox Proportional hazards model was used for identifying significant prognostic risk factors. Kaplan-Meier curves for each group were evaluated by a logrank test. Results From 2005 until the end of 2011 103 patients aged \u2265 75 years were diagnosed with a DLBCL. The median age was 81 years (range 75 \u2013 96) with a slight female predominance (57%). The median observation period was 13 months (range 1 \u2013 78) and 31 months for those still alive at time of evaluation.19 patients (19%) had stage 1 disease; in 74 patients (71%) advanced disease (stage 2\u20134) was reported and in 10 patients (10%) staging was incomplete. In 84 patients (81%) an age adjusted International Prognostic Index was calculated, 43% of them had an aaIPI of 2 or 3. Of the patients with stage 1 disease, 13 (68%) received three courses of R-CHOP and radiotherapy with a curative intent. Eight (62%) of them did complete this therapy. Of the other 84 patients 57 (68%) received R-CHOP chemotherapy with a curative intent. 31 (54%) of them completed at least six cycles. Ultimately 39 patients (56%), who did start with a standard therapy regimen, completed their treatment. A complete remission was achieved in 30 patients (77%). In the remaining group 10 patients (10%) received alternative, suboptimal, rituximab-based chemotherapy, 9 (9%) of patients was treated with radiotherapy. In 12 patients (11%) only supportive care was given. Severe toxicity (grade 3\u20134), occurred in 66% of all patients treated with rituximab-containing chemotherapy. Toxicity grade 3\u20134 was the main reason for receiving less then six cycles of chemotherapy (44%). Ten toxicity-related deaths (13%) were observed in patients treated with R-CHOP, with eight deaths due to infectious complications. The two-year survival was 67% for the elderly who completed chemotherapy, 25% for those treated with incomplete or inferior chemotherapy regimens and 20% for those receiving palliative radiotherapy or supportive care. In a multivariate analysis completing therapy and not age was significantly associated with a better survival (p<0.001). Conclusion Over a period of six years the majority of patients in Friesland with a DLBCL and aged \u2265 75 years was treated with a R-CHOP and 56% could complete this treatment. The ability to complete such an intensive treatment was significantly associated with a better 2-years survival (67%) compared to suboptimal chemotherapy (25%) or either palliative radiotherapy or supportive care (20%). Severe treatment-related toxicity was also observed in 66% patients, with 13% toxicity-related deaths. Age only is a poor indicator to differentiate the fit elderly patient, who will benefit from intensive therapy, from the frail. Other strategies for patient selection, such as the implication of a comprehensive geriatric assessment, should be further evaluated in very elderly patients with DLBCL.
