    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3742 CD4 + T helper (Th) cells play a critical role in the development of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD). The relative contributions of particular Th subsets to GVHD pathogenesis, however, are incompletely understood. In order to clarify the contribution of the Th17 subset to GVHD induction, we made use of mice knocked out at the RORgt locus (RORgt \u2212/\u2212 ), a transcription factor crucial for Th17 polarization. Methods: Haplotype matched and complete MHC mismatched murine HSCT models were used. For the haploidentical model C57BL/6 (H-2 b , B6) mice served as donors while C57BL/6 \u00d7 DBA2 F1 (H-2 bxd , B6D2) mice functioned as recipients. Effector T cells (T effs ) were isolated from the spleens of wild type (WT) B6 and RORgt knockout mice backcrossed 7\u20138 generations onto a B6 background. B6D2 mice were lethally irradiated with 900 rads on day -1 and injected intravenously with 4 \u00d7 10 6 T effs from WT or RORgt \u2212/\u2212 mice supplemented with 3 \u00d7 10 6 WT T cell depleted bone marrow cells (TCD BM) on day 0. For the completely MHC mismatched model, BALB/c mice (H-2 d ) were lethally irradiated with 800 rads on day -1 and administered 5 \u00d7 10 5 WT or RORgt \u2212/\u2212 T effs supplemented with 5 \u00d7 10 6 B6 TCD BM on day 0. Results: B6D2 mice that received RORgt \u2212/\u2212 T effs displayed significantly attenuated GvHD, recovering from weight loss by day +31 and demonstrating 100% survival on day +60. Conversely, mice that received WT T effs showed intense disease progression with 100% mortality by day +31 ( Figure A , p<0.0001 for survival comparison between WT and RORgt \u2212/\u2212 recipients using Fisher's exact test). Similar results were seen using the completely MHC mismatched model, with superior overall survival noted in those animals receiving RORgt \u2212/\u2212 T effs (put in p value here). Recipients of RORgt \u2212/\u2212 T cells demonstrated statistically significant decreased TNF in serum compared to WT recipients ( Figure B , p=0.001 comparing WT and RORgt \u2212/\u2212 recipients using student's t test). Interestingly, despite the decreased severity of GvHD, serum concentrations of IFN-g were increased in recipients transplanted with RORgt \u2212/\u2212 T cells. Chimerism studies post-transplant revealed complete donor reconstitution in recipients of both RORgt \u2212/\u2212 and WT T effs . Donor T effs isolated from recipient livers post-transplant consistently demonstrated an activated phenotype, with low L selectin and high CD25 expression.

GvHD attenuation in the absence of RORgt is not the result of an inability for donor T cells to undergo activation or to engraft in vivo . Interestingly, the absence of RORgt from donor T cells led to enhanced IFN-g in serum. Thus, in vivo, the Th17 pathway is critical for the induction of GvHD.
