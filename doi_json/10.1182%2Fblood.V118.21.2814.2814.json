    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2814 Background: The majority of primary and secondary MF, PV, and ET neoplasms are characterized by gain-of-function activation of JAK2 V617F/STAT5 signaling. Given that wild-type JAK2 plays a pivotal role in multiple stages of hematopoiesis it is desirable to treat JAK2 V617F-positive cases by selectively inhibiting JAK2 V617F while minimizing inhibition of wild-type JAK2 in order not to impede normal marrow function. In murine MPN models and in vitro cell based assays, a novel JAK2 inhibitor, LY2784544, demonstrates selective inhibition of JAK2 V617F/STAT5 signaling and mutant cell proliferation (Ma et al. Abstract 4087 ASH 2010). These results provided the basis for the LY2784544 Phase I trial in MF, PV, and ET patients (I3X-MC-JHTA, NCT01134120 ). Methods: The primary objectives are to determine the safety and tolerability of LY2784544 and define a recommended oral daily dose for further study in patients with JAK2 V617F-positive MF, ET, or PV. Secondary objectives include determination of pharmacokinetics and evaluation of response using the IWG-MRT response criteria, European Leukemia Net response criteria for PV and ET (EULN), and symptom burden using the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) (Scherber et. al. Blood 2011). The study has a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The study was recently amended to allow cohort expansions at lower than MTD doses demonstrating potential clinical merit. Results: To date, 19 patients have been treated: 1 PV, 1 post-ET MF, and 17 MF patients. Four patients discontinued therapy, 1 for each of the following: Adverse Event, progressive disease, investigator decision, and subject's decision. Reported drug-related serious adverse events were seen in 4 patients, and include: creatinine increase (n=4 grade 2), hyperuricemia (2 grade 4), and hyperkalemia (1 grade 1). All resolved within 14 days with temporary treatment interruption. Analysis of collected laboratory studies using the definitions of Cairo and Bishop (BJH 2004, 2010) demonstrated that 1 instance of laboratory tumor lysis syndrome (LTLS) and 3 instances of Grade 2 clinical tumor lysis syndrome (CTLS) occurred. Hyperuricemia and creatinine increases in cases of TLS were reported as dose-limiting toxicities at 240 and 200 mg with 1 and 3 instances at each respective dose. The most frequently reported drug-related AEs across all grades were diarrhea (3 grade 2, 5 grade 1), nausea (3 grade 2, 4 grade 1), transient increased creatinine (4 grade 2), anemia (3 grade 2, 1 grade 1), and hyperuricemia (2 grade 4). A palpable spleen length reduction of at least 35% was seen in 13 of 17 evaluable patients (76% including 16 MF and 1PV). A partial response by EULN for PV involving 100% reduction in spleen size was observed for >10 months. In MF, 7 patients had a \u226550% reduction, including 4 with sufficient stability or duration of follow-up to qualify as a clinical improvement by IWG-MRT. After 5 cycles of therapy, a reduction in bone marrow fibrosis grade was observed in 3 of the 5 MF patients for whom follow-up biopsy results are available. Using the MPN-SAF questionnaire, patients reported improvements in symptom burden within the first 2 cycles of therapy. Fifty-nine percent (59%) reported a \u226550% improvement in the Key MPN Related Symptoms, and 47% reported a \u226550% improvement in the categories of Fatigue-Enjoyment of Life, Fatigue-Walking Ability, itching, and early satiety. A similar level of improvement was reported by 65% of patients for inactivity, while 35% had improvements in bone pain and night sweats. At tested doses, a reduction in mutant allele burden has not been observed. Conclusions: An MTD for daily dosing of LY2784544 was identified as 120 mg. Based on PK analysis, exposure from doses associated with TLS appear to overlap the lower boundary of the predicted biologically efficacious dose (BED) range established in murine JAK2 V617F models. To allow testing of doses within the BED, the dosing regimen has been amended to include a lower dose lead-in period, intended to reduce tumor burden, prior to further testing of dose escalation. This trial amendment will also further evaluate the bone marrow fibrosis response. Disclosures: Verstovsek: Eli Lilly: Research Funding.
