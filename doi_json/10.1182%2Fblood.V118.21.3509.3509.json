    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3509 Non-cytotoxic DNA methyl-transferase 1 (DNMT1) depletion by decitabine induces p53-independent differentiation mediated cell cycle exit in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and spares normal hematopoietic stem cells, providing a potentially important alternative to conventional apoptosis-based therapy. However, there are pharmacologic barriers that impede optimal clinical translation of pre-clinical observations. One major barrier is the enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDA), which drastically reduces the half-life of decitabine from many hours in vitro to a few minutes in vivo . This problem is significant since decitabine is S-phase specific in its mechanism of action, and for effective DNMT1 depletion, low peak levels but extended half-life are optimal. Furthermore, CDA is highly expressed in the liver and intestines, generating potential sanctuary sites from the effects of decitabine. Finally, upregulation of CDA expression is a potential mechanism by which AML cells may resist decitabine at the cellular level. To overcome the multiple CDA-mediated barriers to effective therapy, we evaluated the combination of very low dose decitabine with the CDA inhibitor tetrahydrouridine (THU) in a murine xenotransplantation model of aggressive human AML (THP1 AML cells \u2013 p53 and p16-null). Treatment groups (n=5 per group) received equal volume vehicle (PBS), low dose cytarabine (0.1 mg/kg subcutaneous [SC]) with (THU) (4mg/kg intraperitoneal [IP]), decitabine (0.1 mg/kg SC) with THU (4mg/kg IP), and decitabine alone (0.2 mg/kg SC). Median survival in decitabine (61 days) and THU-decitabine (70 days) treated mice was significantly extended compared to the PBS (38 days) and THU-cytarabine (50 days) treatment groups (Log Rank p=0.00156 (figure 1). In decitabine treated mice, eventual emergence of disease was concentrated in the liver, consistent with a sanctuary function of this organ. Combination of THU with decitabine largely eliminated liver infiltration by AML, reducing liver tumor load from average 5.2g in PBS treated mice to 0.8g in THU-Decitabine treated mice (t-test p<0.001, livers were harvested at different time-points corresponding to the Kaplan-Meier curve). In separate experiments without AML cell xenotransplantation, the non-cytotoxic, DNMT1 depleting character of the decitabine therapy was confirmed by hematologic and bone marrow evaluation for DNA damage by phospho-H2AX staining. In conclusion, combining THU with decitabine can address malignant cell sanctuary in the liver, an organ that expresses high levels of cytidine deaminase. The ability of this combination to address other aspects of CDA-mediated resistance to therapy is also being evaluated. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
