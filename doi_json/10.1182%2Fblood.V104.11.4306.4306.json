    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the accumulation of clonal malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. One of the hallmarks of plasma cells is the expression of the heparan-sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1. In epithelial cells, syndecan-1 plays a major role as a coreceptor for heparin-binding growth factors and chemokines. This stresses that heparin-binding growth factors may play a major role in the biology of MM cells. Recently we have demonstrated that heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), one of the ten members of the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) family, is produced by the tumor microenvironment and is able to trigger myeloma cell growth. As amphiregulin (AREG) is another member of the EGF family that also binds heparan-sulphate chains, we investigated its role in MM. We looked for AREG expression on a panel of 7 normal plasmablastic cells (PPCs), 7 normal bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs), purified MM cells from 65 patients and 20 myeloma cell lines (HMCLs), with Affymetrix U133A+B microarrays. We showed that primary MM cells overexpress AREG compared to normal BMPCs and PPCs. We then investigated the expression of the ErbB receptors with real-time RT-PCR. Myeloma cells variably expressed the 4 ErbB receptors. Normal BMPCs also expressed ErbB1 and ErbB2 unlike PPCs that did not express any ErbB receptors. We demonstrated that the high AREG expression by primary myeloma cells may have a dual effect. On the one hand, AREG stimulated IL-6 production and growth of bone-marrow stromal cells that highly express the AREG ErbB1 receptor. On the other hand, AREG could promote HMCL proliferation, suggesting that a functional autocrine loop involving AREG and ErbB receptors is involved in MM cell growth. Finally, we looked for the effect of ErbB inhibitors on MM cells of 14 patients cultured for 6 days together with their bone marrow environment. A pan-ErbB inhibitor (PD-169540, Pfizer) and an ErbB1-inhibitor (IRESSA, Astrazeneca) induced strong MM cell apoptosis in respectively 71% of patients (10 of 14) and 29% of patients (4 of 14). Of major interest, when PD169540 or IRESSA were combined with dexamethasone, they induced a dramatic myeloma cell death (respectively 92% and 69% inhibition of MM cell survival), while non-myeloma cells were unaffected. Thus ErbB activation is critical to trigger MM-cell survival in short-term culture. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence for a major role of AREG and HB-EGF in the biology of multiple myeloma and identify ErbB receptors as putative therapeutic targets. These data emphasize the interest of clinical evaluation of specific-ErbB-inhibitors in patients with MM, either used alone or in combination with dexamethasone."
