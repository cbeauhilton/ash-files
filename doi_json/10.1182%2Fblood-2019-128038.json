    "abstract_text": "Background: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare clonogenic disease of hematopoietic stem cells. LncRNA has a wide range of biological functions, including regulation of gene expression, cell differentiation, cell proliferation and substance metabolism.LncRNA maybe contribute to the proliferation of PNH clone. Methods: PNH clone (CD59-cells) and (CD59+cells) from PNH patients were sorted and analyzed by RNA sequencing in 5 PNH patients. The results were analyzed by KEGG, we focus on the proliferation relative pathway-NF-kB pathway. The mRNA(TAB2, TLR4, LYN,CFLAR, TNFAIP3, PTGS2, TRIM25, CXCL8) which FPKM>10 and over 3 pathients were chosen to search out the upstream regulation LncRNA. MALAT1 and LINC01002 were screened by Co-expression. Then the expression of MALAT1 and LINC01002 in 30 PNH patients were detected by qRT-PCR to vertify the LncRNA sequencing results. Results: Transcription analysis revealed that 742 upregulation LncRNA and 3276 upregulation mRNA were identified in CD59 - cells. The highly expressed NF-kB pathway mRNA (TAB2, TLR4, LYN,CFLAR, TNFAIP3, PTGS2, TRIM25, CXCL8) were analysed by LncRNA co-expression, after that MALAT1and LINC01002 were concerned with the 8 mRNA. The results of PNH primary cells (CD59 - cells) showed that the level of MALAT1and LINC01002 expression was significantly higher than that of the CD59 + cell in 30 PNH patients (p<0.05). Conclusion: MALAT1and LINC01002 seems to be involved in the proliferation of PNH clones. Its mechanism of action in patients with PNH needs further study.
