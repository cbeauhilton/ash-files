    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2384 Introduction: Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been used to treat malignant hematological diseases. For patients who do not have a matched sibling donor or a matched unrelated donor (MUD) for transplantation, an eligible HLA-haploidentical donor can be identified rapidly in nearly all cases. However, HLA-haploidentical BMT has been associated with significant risks of complication, such as graft rejection and severe GVHD and infection. Materials and Methods: Thirty eight consecutive patients with malignant hematological diseases received HLA-haploidentical stem cell transplant from April 2008 to June 2010. Eligible patients were 9\u2013 48 years of age with acute myeloid leukemia (n=10),acute lymphocytic leukemia (n=17), myelodysplastic syndrome(n=5), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=4), non Hodgkin lymphoma (n=2). Transplantation conditioning consisted of Ara-C (4 g/m2/d, i.v.) on day -10 and -9, Bu (9.6mg/kg i.v. in 12 doses) on day -8, -7 and -6, Cy (1.8 g/m2/d, i.v.) on day -5 and -4, Me-CCNU (250 mg/kg, i.v.) on day -3, and ATG (2.5 mg/kg/d i.v.) on day -5 to -2. The prophylaxis of aGVHD consisted of cyclosporine A (CsA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and short-term methotrexate. Donors were primed with rhG-CSF (7.5 mg/kg per day) injected subcutaneous (s.c.). Bone marrow cells and peripheral blood stem cells(PBSC) were harvested in nineteen donors, and only PBSC were harvested in the other 19 donors. Results: Primary engraftment was achieved in all patients. All the patients achieved complete donor chimerism in the peripheral blood before day +28. Seven patients (18.4%) had grade I aGVHD, ten (26.3%) had grade II aGVHD, four(10.5%) had grade III aGVHD and four (10.5%) had grade IV aGVHD. II-IV aGVHD occurred in nine patients treated with bone marrow cells and PBSCs, the same number patients suffered from II-IV aGVHD treated with only PBSCs. Transplant related mortality within 100 days after transplantation was 15.8%. At a median follow-up of 10 months (range 2\u201328months), the overall survival was 68.4%. Conclusion: Haploidentical stem cell transplantation is relatively safe and efficient for the patients who have no HLA matched donors.The results require to confirm and show that G-BM combined with PBSC or G-PBSC from haploidentical family donors have equal effect.
