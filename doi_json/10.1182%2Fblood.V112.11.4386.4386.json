    "abstract_text": "130 patients who were unsuitable for conventional-intensity conditioning underwent RI-HSCT after 100 mg/m 2 melphalan (+ 50 mg/kg cyclophosphamide if no prior autograft). GVHD prophylaxis comprised cyclosporine (HLA-matched siblings) or tacrolimus (all others) and MMF. Table 1: Patient characteristics Age (y) . 19\u201371 (median 55) .

Bone Marrow Transplant 2006) \u2013with the additional emergence of HLA mismatch and thrombocytopenia which were significant in univariate but not multivariate analysis then. These data suggest that RI-HSCT is useful for some patients with hematologic malignancies who are ineligible for conventional-intensity HSCT. However, alternative HSCT techniques or non-HSCT options are needed for high-risk patients.
