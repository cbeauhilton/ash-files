    "abstract_text": "Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u03b2, a serine/threonine kinase, reportedly regulates the canonical Wnt and Hedgehog pathways. Evidence indicates that thrombopoietin, a major regulator of thrombopoiesis, induces several signaling pathways, such as MAPK, PI3K, and JAK/STAT. Here, we present data showing a novel role of GSK-3\u03b2 in megakaryocyte (MK) and platelet production in an in vitro hematopoietic cell culture system. Primary human low-density bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) were grown in serum-free media containing thrombopoietin and several inhibitors: PD98059, SB202190, LY294002 or TWS119 was used to inhibit MAPK, p38MAPK, PI3K, or GSK-3\u03b2, respectively. The MK or platelet cell count was examined by flow cytometry on day 12 using the relative value of CD41 (+)/propidium iodide (+) cells or platelet size CD41 (+) cells, respectively, versus 10 6 BMMNCs on day 0. When the cells were treated with PD98059, SB202190, or LY294002, the MKs and platelets decreased in number compared with the non-treated control cells. In contrast, MK and platelet production was increased by the presence of TWS119 in the cell culture [TWS119 (+)] as compared with its absence in the cell culture [TWS119 (\u2212)]: MKs, 24965.3\u00b15437.7 vs 5763.7\u00b1874.0, p=0.0038, platelets, 6645.8\u00b1792.0 vs 3276.0\u00b1298.1, p=0.0023. In addition, human CD34 (+) cells were obtained from BMMNCs and grown in the liquid culture system, and each small interference RNA (siRNA) for GSK-3\u03b2 or negative control was transfected into the cells on day 3. The frequency of CD41 (+)/propidium iodide (+) cells in siRNA-GSK3\u03b2 transfected-cells was 2-fold higher than that in siRNA-negative control transfected cells. The transcriptional profiling was then compared between BMMNCs in TWS119 (+/\u2212) to study the mechanism underlying the effect of GSK-3\u03b2 on MK and platelet production. This analysis using the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 Gene Chip array, which covers approximately 50000 transcripts, demonstrated genes with significantly increased or decreased expression in TWS119 (+) relative to TWS119 (\u2212) at day 8. Of those genes, some factors associated with cytoskeletal organization, such as Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor and \u03b2 tubulin cofactor A, had increased expression, while others, such as supervillin and \u03b1 tubulin, had decreased expression. The BMMNC-derived MKs and platelets in TWS119 (+/\u2212) were morphologically analyzed with electron microscopy. The size of MKs in TW119 (+) was larger in diameter than that of MKs in TWS119 (\u2212). Also, there was abundant mature MKs in TWS119 (+) whereas most MKs in TWS119 (\u2212) were immature at day 8. However, there was no difference in the ultrastructure of platelets obtained from the MKs in TWS119 (+) or TWS119 (\u2212). The findings of the present study demonstrated that GSK-3\u03b2 negatively regulates MK and platelet production. Alterations in the MK morphology and/or maturation time might contribute to this regulation.",
