    "abstract_text": "Background Mutations (mut) in the WT1 gene belong to the first genetic aberrations described in AML. In contrast to recurrent fusion genes or NPM1 mut WT1mut do not seem to be disease defining. Also in contrast to other mutations in AML, for most of which a certain prognostic value has been established, the impact of WT1 mut still is discussed controversially. Aim Analyze the frequency and prognostic impact of WT1 mutations in comparison to other genetic aberrations. Patients and Methods 3,157 unselected AML patients (pts) were analyzed (de novo: n=2,699, s-AML: n=234, t-AML: n=224). 1,708 pts were male and 1,449 female. Median age was 67.1 years (y) (range: 17.8-100.4 y) with 1,108 pts <60 y and 2,049 \u226560 y. The mutational hot spot regions of WT1 (exons 7 and 9) were analyzed by direct Sanger sequencing with a sensitivity of \u223c10%. Karyotype and WT1 mutation status was available in all cases. Other mutations were assessed in subsets: ASXL1 (n=1,951), CEBPA (n=2,670), DNMT3A (n=1,293), FLT3 -ITD (n=3,149), FLT3 -TKD (n=3,004), IDH1 R132 (n=2,431), IDH2 R140 (n=2,380), IDH2 R172 (n=2,412), KRAS (n=1,409), NRAS (n=1,780), NPM1 (n=3,003), MLL -PTD (n=2,961), RUNX1 (n=2,390), TET2 (n=1,016) and TP53 (n=1,215). Results A total of 189 WT1 mutations were detected (exon 7: n=151, exon 9: n=38). The total frequency of WT1mut pts was 175/3,157 (5.5%). 11 pts were double to quadruple mutated. The frequency was heterogeneous with respect to AML subtypes. Compared to all others, significantly higher frequencies were detected in biallelic CEBPA mut (15/110; 13.6%; p=0.001), followed by t(15;17)/ PML-RARA (18/164; 11.0%, p=0.004), and FLT3 -ITD (58/682; 8.5%, p<0.001). Lower frequencies were observed in DNMT3A mut (18/412; 4.3%, p=0.014, ASXL1 mut (6/355; 1.7%, p<0.001), IDH2 R140 (5/286; 1.7%, p=0.001), and IDH1 R132 (2/222; 0.9%, p<0.001). WT1 mut were never detected in pts with complex karyotypes (0/175; p=0.047) or those with IDH2 R172 (0/68; p=0.020). Further, WT1 mut were more frequent in females (95/1,449, 6.6%) than in males (80/1,708, 4.7%) (p=0.014) and in younger pts (<60 y: 102/1,108, 9.2% vs \u2265 60 y: 73/2,049, 3.6%; p<0.001). Median age of pts with WT1 mut was 55.5 y compared to 63.6 in WT1 wt (p<0.001). Further, WT1 mut were associated with lower platelet count (58.4 vs 84.7 x10 9 /L; p<0.001) and lower hemoglobin level (8.8 vs 9.3 g/dL, p=0.001). There was no association to the history of the disease or white blood cell count. Stability of WT1 mut was analyzed in 35 paired diagnostic and relapse samples (median time of relapse after diagnoses: 11.1 months (m); range: 2.6-60.6 m). In 23 cases (65.7%) the WT1 mut was retained at relapse and in 12 cases (34.3%) it was lost. In 5 cases a sample at 2nd relapse was available (median time from 1st relapse: 8.5 m, range: 6.0-18.0 m). 3 of these cases retained and 2 lost the WT1 mut. Analysis of prognostic impact was restricted to intensively treated pts (n=1,936, WT1 mut: n=132, 6.8%). In the total cohort, there was no impact of WT1 mut on prognosis. In pts \u226560 y there was a trend to shorter event free survival (EFS) for WT1 mut (9.3 vs 12.3 m, p=0.052). In the two prognostically favorable groups with high WT1 mut incidences (biallelic CEBPA mut and PML-RARA ) no effect on outcome was seen. When restricting the analysis to normal karyotype AML ( WT1 mut: n=85, WT1 wt: n=1,093) WT1 mut pts had shorter EFS (10.8 vs 17.9 m, p=0.008). This was true for the younger (12.2 vs 29.0 m, p=0.007) as well as for the older pts (9.3 vs 13.9 m, p=0.016). In a multivariate analysis all parameters with significant impact on EFS in univariate analysis were included: age (p<0.001, HR: 1.24), ASXL1 mut (p<0.001, HR: 1.36), FLT3 -ITD (p<0.001, HR: 1.55), NPM1 mut/ FLT3 -ITD wild-type (p<0.001, HR:1.55), RUNX1 (p=0.019, HR: 1.23, and WT1 mut (p=0.009, HR: 1.64). In multivariate analysis WT1 mut was found to have independent adverse impact on EFS (p=0.002, HR: 1.64) besides FLT3 -ITD status (p<0.001, HR: 1.71) and age (p<0.001, HR: 1.28). Conclusions WT1 mutations are 1) more frequent in females and younger AML, 2) more frequent in t(15;17)/ PML-RARA , biallelic CEBPA mut, FLT3 -ITD mutated AML, and nearly mutually exclusive of ASXL1, IDH1, IDH2 and complex karyotype. 3) The distribution pattern in different genetic subtypes and the instability during follow-up as shown by paired sample analyses clearly emphasize a secondary character of this mutation. 4) For AML with normal karyotype an independent adverse impact of WT1 mut on EFS was shown.
