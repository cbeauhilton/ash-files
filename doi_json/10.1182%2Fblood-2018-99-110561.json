    "abstract_text": "Introduction Autologous T cells expressing a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) have produced impressive minimal residual disease-negative complete remission (MRD-neg CR) rates in relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients (pts). Factors associated with durable remission in pts achieving MRD-neg CR after immunotherapy with T cells engineered with a CD19 CAR (FMC63.41bb.3\u03b6) have not been elucidated. Methods We studied factors impacting disease-free survival (DFS) of adults with B-ALL treated with lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CD19 CAR-T cells in a phase I/II clinical trial (NCT01865617). Pts were eligible for this analysis if they had bone marrow leukemia identified by flow cytometry and/or extramedullary disease before CAR-T cell therapy, and received CAR-T cells at or below the previously determined maximum tolerated dose (MTD; Turtle, JCI 2016). Anti-tumor response after CAR-T cell infusion was assessed by bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, with PET-CT performed in pts with extramedullary disease. High resolution (1:10,000) flow cytometry was used to identify marrow MRD, and marrow from pts in MRD-neg CR was evaluated by high throughput sequencing (HTS) of IGH , IGK, TRB, TRD , and TRG genes. Cox regression univariate and stepwise multivariable modeling were performed to identify factors associated with DFS. Results Of 57 pts who received lymphodepletion and CD19 CAR-T cells, 53 were evaluable for response and 4 were not evaluable (one MRD-neg CR before CAR-T cell infusion; 2 received CAR-T cells above the MTD; one fatal neurotoxicity prior to restaging). Forty-five of 53 restaged pts (85%) achieved MRD-neg CR after CAR-T cell therapy. With a median follow-up of 30.9 months, DFS and overall survival (OS) were longer in pts who achieved MRD-neg CR compared to those who did not (Fig 1A; median DFS, 7.6 vs 0.8 months, P < .0001; median OS, 20.0 vs 5.0 months, P = .014). Twenty-eight of the 45 pts who achieved MRD-neg CR had a leukemic clone identified by HTS prior to CAR-T cell infusion, and in 20 of these pts (71%), the leukemic clone was not detected in marrow 3 weeks after CAR-T cell infusion. DFS was better in MRD-neg CR pts with no detected malignant clone compared to those with a persistent clone by HTS (Fig 1B; median DFS, 8.4 vs 3.6 months, P = .036). We then used stepwise multivariable modeling to determine factors impacting DFS in the pts who achieved MRD-neg CR (n = 45). Better DFS was seen in pts with a higher pre-lymphodepletion platelet count (hazard ratio, HR 0.65 [95% CI; 0.47-0.88] per 50,000/\u03bcL increment P = .006), lower pre-lymphodepletion LDH (HR 1.39 [1.12-1.74] per 100 U/L increment, P = .003), and with incorporation of fludarabine into the cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion (Cy/Flu; HR 0.34 [0.15-0.78], P = .011). Similar findings were noted in analysis of MRD-neg CR pts who had no malignant clone by HTS after CAR-T cells. Pts with platelets \u2265100,000/\u03bcL and normal LDH before lymphodepletion who received Cy/Flu (good risk, n = 15) had 2-year point estimates of DFS and OS of 78% and 86%, respectively. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is standard of care in suitable R/R adult B-ALL pts after achieving MRD-neg CR. Eighteen pts in MRD-neg CR after CAR-T cells underwent HCT a median of 2.3 months after CAR-T cell infusion. We analyzed the effect on DFS of HCT after CAR-T cell therapy by treating HCT as a time-dependent covariate. After adjusting for LDH, platelets, and Cy/Flu lymphodepletion, pts undergoing HCT after CAR-T cell therapy had lower risk of failure for DFS compared to those who did not undergo HCT (Table 1). No significant interaction effect was seen between HCT and risk group ( P = .51). With a median follow-up of 28.4 months after HCT, 2-year point estimates of DFS and OS were 61% and 72% respectively. The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 17% and non-relapse mortality was 23%. Conclusion A high rate of MRD-neg CR was seen following CD19 CAR-T cell therapy in adult B-ALL pts and is associated with improved DFS and OS. Absence of the index clone by HTS after CAR-T cells was associated with better DFS, suggesting deeper responses are associated with improved outcomes. Stepwise multivariable modeling identifies better DFS in pts with higher pre-lymphodepletion platelet count and lower LDH, and with use of Cy/Flu lymphodepletion. After adjusting for these factors, HCT after CD19 CAR-T cells may also be associated with better DFS.
