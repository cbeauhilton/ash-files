    "abstract_text": "Background We have previously reported on the high prevalence and severity of challenges with intimacy and sexuality amongst a large international cohort of MPN patients (Emanuel JCO 2012). We sought to further analyze the relationships between issues of intimacy (sexual desire and function), their relationships to MPN disease features, individual MPN symptom prevalence and severity, language, and overall quality of life. Methods Data was collected among an international cohort of patients with MPNs. Subjects completed the BFI, MPN-SAF, and EORTC QLQ-C30 instruments. Surveyed symptoms on the MPN-SAF included the patient\u2019s perceptions of common MPN-related symptoms and overall quality of life (QOL) on a 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable) scale. Specifically, the MPN-SAF sexuality item asked about \u201cproblems with sexual desire or function\u201d. Total symptom score (TSS) was computed based on 10 symptom items using the published scoring algorithm on a 0 (all reported symptoms absent) to 100 (all reported symptoms worst imaginable) scale. Pairwise associations between the MPN-SAF sexuality item and continuous and categorical covariates were investigated using Pearson correlations and analysis of variance/t-tests, respectively. Multivariate regression models were used to investigate impact of groups of covariates on the sexuality item with the final multivariate model selected using forward regression. Results Demographics A total of 1908 MPN patients (essential thrombocythemia=799, polycythemia vera=671, myelofibrosis=432, missing=6) completed the sexuality item. Participants were of typical age (median=60, range 15-94) and gender (female=53%). Overall, 1218 subjects described sexuality related complaints (score >0) with an overall mean symptom score of 3.5 (median=2.0, SD=3.7, range 0-10); 725/1908 (38%) patients had severe sexuality related complaints (score >4). Univariate Analysis Among the QLQ-C30 functioning scales, all domains had similar statistically significant correlations (r=-.26 to -.32, all p<0.001). Among QLQ-C30 symptom scales, all QLQ-C30 symptoms displayed correlations ranging between .08 and .29 (all p<0.001). Among MPN-SAF items, the MPN-SAF sexuality item correlated most significantly with the TSS (r=.41, p<0.001), along with MPN-SAF symptoms (r=.16 to .39; all p<0.001). MPN-SAF sexuality measure significantly differed by anemia (means: absent 3.3, present 4.5; p<0.001), leukopenia (means: absent 3.4, present 4.4; p=0.01), thrombocytopenia (means: absent 3.3, present 4.5; p<0.001), red cell transfusion (means: no 3.5, yes 5.0; p<0.001), MPN subtype (ET mean 3.1, PV mean=3.6, MF mean=4.4; p<0.001) and language (means ranged from 2.4 [Swedish] to 4.6 [Chinese]; p<0.001). MPN-SAF sexuality did not significantly differ by age, gender, prior thrombosis or prior hemorrhage. Multivariate Analysis In a multivariate model of MPN-SAF sexuality containing all QLQ-C30 functioning scales, physical (p=0.001), emotional (p=0.01), cognitive (p=0.005) and social (p=0.002) functioning were all statistically significant. Numerous symptoms were also significant in a multivariate model of MPN-SAF sexuality containing all other MPN-SAF symptoms (all p<0.05; abdominal pain, inactivity, dizziness/vertigo/lightheadedness, insomnia, depression/sad mood, cough, night sweats and overall QOL). The final multivariate model based on forward regression starting with all demographics, clinical variables, and patient-reported QLQ-C30 scales and MPN-SAF items found age, language, QLQ-C30 role functioning and MPN-SAF items (insomnia, depression/sad mood, night sweats and QOL) to be significant (p<0.05). Conclusions Sexuality related complaints have been linked to both physiologic and psychologic origins and are highly prevalent within the MPN population. The results of this study congruently identified close associations between sexuality and function within emotional, cognitive and social domains. Additionally, the correlations of sexuality issues with MPN symptoms and disease features further suggest this item is a key correlate of overall functionality and quality of life. Future investigations into the causative factors and biological correlates of this complaint may assist in addressing this ongoing challenge.
