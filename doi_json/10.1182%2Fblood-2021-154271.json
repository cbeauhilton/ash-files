    "abstract_text": "Genetic deletions of IKZF1 are associated with poor prognosis in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Here we investigated the effect of IKZF1 deletions (IKZF1 del ) plus with immunotype in adult B-ALL in PDT-ALL-2016 cohort. This cohort study involved 161 patients with B-ALL from 2016 to 2019, with detailed information about IKZF1 del and CD20 expression. Validation cohort consists N= patients from TARGET cohort. IKZF1 del was detected in 36.0% of patients with 3-year event-free survival (EFS) of 37.2\u00b16.7% and overall survival (OS) of 51.1\u00b17.3%, compared to IKZF1 wild-type (IKZF1 wt ) with EFS 55.4\u00b15.1% ( P <0.01) and OS 74.6\u00b14.5% ( P <0.05), respectively. CD20 expression was also associated with inferior EFS than CD20-negative group ( P <0.05). Furthermore, IKZF1 del coupled with CD20 expression, termed as IKZF1 del/CD20 + , comprised 12.4% of patients with 3-year EFS of 25.0\u00b19.7% compared with IKZF1 w t ( P<0.05 ) and IKZF1 del/CD20- ( P<0.05 ) groups, respectively. Multivariable analyses demonstrated independence of IKZF1 del/CD20+ with highest hazard ratio for EFS and OS. Furthermore, the prognostic strength of IKZF1 del/CD20+ was confirmed in TARGET validation cohort. Eighty-one patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Notably, neither IKZF1 del ( P =0.6288), CD20 ( P =0.0705) or IKZF1 del/CD 20 ( P =0.3410) groups were identified as poor outcome in allo-HSCT cohort. Collectively, our data demonstrate that IKZF1 del/CD20 + represents a very high-risk subtype in adult B-ALL; and particularly, allo-HSCT could overcome the poor outcome of IKZF1 del and IKZF1 del/CD20+ .
