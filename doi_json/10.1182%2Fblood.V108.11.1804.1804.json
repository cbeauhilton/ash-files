    "abstract_text": "Atherosclerosis has been described as a \u201cself-perpetuating\u201d inflammatory disease which progresses in discrete stages and involves a number of cell types and effector molecules. Lipid metabolic disorders are heavily involved in the genesis and progression of atherosclerosis in humans, and thrombotic complications substantially contribute to the coronary artery disease that frequently accompanies atherosclerosis. A relevant mouse model of human atherosclerosis with elevated LDL-cholesterol (C) is one in which both the Ldlr and Apobec1 genes are deleted ( Ldlr \u2212 / \u2212 /Apobec1 \u2212 / \u2212 ), since these mice lack the ability to convert apoB-100 to apoB-48 in liver and also are defective in LDL clearance. We have generated Ldlr \u2212 / \u2212 /Apobec1 \u2212 / \u2212 / PAI-1 \u2212 / \u2212 and characterized atherosclerosis progression in these mice. VLDL, LDL, HDL, and total C levels were identical between Ldlr \u2212 / \u2212 /Apobec1 \u2212 / \u2212 and Ldlr \u2212 / \u2212 /Apobec1 \u2212 / \u2212 / PAI-1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice (VLDL-C; 30.3\u00b11.8 vs 26.0\u00b11.7 (mg/dl), LDL-C; 268.7\u00b16.3 vs 274.1\u00b113.1 (mg/dl), HDL-C; Total-C; 353.8\u00b18.1 vs 356.8\u00b114.5 (mg/dl), respectively). However, both the plaque size in the aortic sinus and the extent of plaque area in aorta were significantly smaller in Ldlr \u2212 / \u2212 /Apobec1 \u2212 / \u2212 / PAI-1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice relative to Ldlr \u2212 / \u2212 /Apobec1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice (plaque in aortic sinus; 158792.9\u00b111958.2 vs 227243.5\u00b115291.1 (\u03bcm 2 ), plaque area in aorta; 3.90\u00b10.34 vs 5.10\u00b10.27 (%), respectively). To elucidate the cellular functions, especially macrophages, in the plaque, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were isolated and utilized for Dil-oxidized (Ox) LDL uptake assays and migration assays using 8 \u03bcm pore culture inserts. There were no significant differences in Dil-OxLDL uptake by BMMs between the two genotypes. The kinetics of migration of BMMs was more rapid in Ldlr \u2212 / \u2212 /Apobec1 \u2212 / \u2212 / PAI-1 \u2212 / \u2212 cells than Ldlr \u2212 / \u2212 /Apobec1 \u2212 / \u2212 cells. Furthermore, thioglycollate-induced intraperitoneal migration of macrophages was increased in Ldlr \u2212 / \u2212 /Apobec1 \u2212 / \u2212 / PAI-1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice vs Ldlr \u2212 / \u2212 /Apobec1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice. Results from these studies indicate that cell migratory differences may contribute to attenuating atheroma formation in a PAI-1 deficient state."
