    "abstract_text": "Background: Increased plasma-soluble von Willebrand factor (vWF) level, a marker of vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, is a predictor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the general population. We compared associations between vWF level and markers of inflammation as well as the effects of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in obese as compared to healthy human subjects. Methods: Plasma samples were obtained from healthy volunteers (n = 32) and obese subjects (n = 12) before and after administration of a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of tinzaparin, given at a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis dose of 75 IU/kg once a day. These samples were analyzed for vWF and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) by ELISA. Also examined was the effect of different LMWH on the release of vWF from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in response to various stimuli, such as oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) or endotoxin. Results: Obese subjects showed higher plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1 compared with normal-weight subjects. Regression analysis showed plasma vWF levels to be directly associated with the presence of higher plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1 in these obese subjects. Tinzaparin, given at a prophylaxis dose for DVT (75 IU/kg, SC, QD), significantly reduced elevated plasma levels of endothelial dysfunction marker vWF associated with higher inflammatory TNF-\u03b1 levels ( P <0.01). HUVEC, when treated with oxidized LDL or endotoxin, demonstrated a significant elevation of vWF release into the medium in a time-dependent manner. Tinzaparin and enoxaparin significantly reduced this increased vWF release from HUVEC in the media. Conclusion: Plasma values of vWF and TNF-\u03b1 are higher in obese than in normal-weight individuals. Treatment with tinzaparin lowers plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1 in both obese and normal-weight subjects. The levels of vWF were higher in obese subjects than in normal-weight ones because of the higher levels of circulating TNF-\u03b1. Tinzaparin reduced vWF levels in these obese subjects. Table 1.
