    "abstract_text": "POG 9405, a randomized phase III study for children with standard risk ALL, opened in 1994. The primary objectives were to determine effects on event-free survival (EFS) of: 1) higher (2.5g/m 2 ) vs. standard (1g/m 2 ) dose methotrexate (MTX) infusions during consolidation (in an attempt to obtain a plasma MTX target of 12 \u03bcmol) and (2) once vs. twice daily 6- mercaptopurine (MP) dosing during continuation (to improve the efficacy of MP based on its short half-life and S-phase dependence). Following remission induction, patients were randomized to: Regimens (Reg) A/B (MTX 1 g/m 2 IV) or C/D (MTX 2.5 g/m 2 ), all with MP 1g/m 2 IV, q2 weeks (wk) x 12. Leucovorin 5 mg/m 2 q6h x 5 began at hour 48 and continued until MTX level was <0.3\u03bcmol. MTX 20 mg/m 2 /wk IM and MP 75 mg/m 2 /day p.o. were given on alternate wks. Continuation was MTX 20 mg/m 2 /wk IM for all patients and MP 75 mg/m 2 daily p.o. for A/C and 37.5 mg/m 2 p.o. b.i.d for B/D. CNS prophylaxis was age-adjusted triple intrathecal therapy (TIT) for a total of 14\u201319 doses due to protocol modifications made because of concerns about neurotoxicity. Total treatment duration was 130 wks. 295 patients entered consolidation therapy. Reg A: 77, Reg B: 77, Reg C: 70, Reg D: 71. The overall 6 year EFS for the study was 80% \u00b12.4% (s.e.). The study closed prematurely in 1996 due to issues pertaining to neurotoxicity. There was no significant difference in EFS between the two 6-MP dosing regimens [once-daily 78% vs. twice-daily 83%; p = 0.222]. Only 36% of patients on Reg C/D received the full 12 courses of higher dose MTX due to above noted protocol modifications. Neither the efficacy nor the toxicity of higher dose MTX can be fully evaluated for this study. 57 Patients (19%) reported one or more grade 2\u20134 neurotoxicity event using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 2.0. These events included: cortical toxicity 37 events (including 33 seizures), cerebellar 15, cognitive dysfunction 6, headaches 4, motor 3, and significant fatigue in 3 children. Preliminary review indicates no difference in neurotoxicity incidence based on MTX dose. This antimetabolite based study highlights the importance of monitoring for neurotoxicity, as well as other unexpected adverse events on subsequent leukemia treatment protocols.",
