    "abstract_text": "Expression of the constitutively activated TEL/PDGF\u03b2R fusion protein is associated with the t(5;12)(q33;p13) chromosomal translocation found in a subset of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). TEL/PDGF\u03b2R activates multiple signal transduction pathways in cell culture systems and induces myeloproliferative disease (MPD) in a murine bone marrow transduction/transplantation model of disease. Two TEL-PDGF\u03b2R juxtamembrane tyrosines, corresponding to tyrosines activating Stat5 and Src signaling molecules in native PDGF\u03b2R, are required for TEL-PDGFRB mediated MPD in mice. We used gene-targeted mice as donors in bone marrow transduction/transplantation experiments to characterize the contribution of Stat and Src genes in the development of TEL-PDGFRB disease. Mice transplanted with cells harboring targeted deletions of both Stat5a and Stat5b genes ( TP i GFP \u2192 Stat5ab \u2212/\u2212) were protected from rapidly fatal MPD (median survival >125 vs. 25 days in TP i GFP \u2192 Stat5ab +/+mice, P<0.0001). In contrast, TP i GFP \u2192 Lyn \u2212 / \u2212 Hck \u2212 / \u2212 Fgr \u2212 / \u2212 mice developed rapidly fatal MPD characterized by splenomegaly and leukocytosis. Similarly, TEL-PDGFRB induced MPD in TP i GFP \u2192 Stat1 \u2212/\u2212 mice and TP i GFP \u2192 Stat1 +/+ strain-matched mice alike (median survival 45 vs. 53 days). These data suggest that Stat5, but not Src family kinases Lyn, Hck and Fgr nor Stat family member Stat1, is functionally relevant in the development of TEL-PDGFRB mediated disease. To assess the relative contribution of the Stat5a gene in TEL-PDGFRB mediated disease, we used mice harboring either homozygous ( Stat5a \u2212/\u2212) or heterozygous ( Stat5a +/\u2212) deletion as donors in bone marrow transduction/transplantation experiments with TEL-PDGFRB . Surprisingly, survival was significantly prolonged in TP i GFP \u2192 Stat5a \u2212/\u2212 mice (144 vs. TP i GFP \u2192Stat5a+/+ 31 days, P <0.0001) and TP i GFP \u2192 Stat5a +/\u2212 mice (145 versus TP i GFP \u2192Stat5a+/+ 31 days, P <0.001), demonstrating significant sensitivity of TEL-PDGFRB -induced MPD to loss of even a single Stat5a allele. TEL-PDGFRB induced severe leukocytosis in TP i GFP \u2192 Stat5a +/+ mice (median WBC 547K/\u03bcL), but disease was attenuated in TP i GFP \u2192 Stat5a +/\u2212 mice mice (median WBC 56K/\u03bcL) and undetectable in TP i GFP \u2192 Stat5a \u2212/\u2212mice (median WBC 5K/\u03bcL), suggesting that TEL-PDGFRB disease is exquisitely sensitive to Stat5a gene dosage. On the other hand, TP i GFP \u2192 Stat5b \u2212/\u2212 mice developed robust MPD with similar latency to wild-type mice. However, 4 of 13 TP i GFP \u2192 Stat5b \u2212/\u2212 mice failed to develop MPD and were longer-lived, suggesting a role for Stat5b in TEL-PDGFRB disease penetrance. To address the possibility that Stat5a and Stat5b were distinct in their ability to transmit myeloproliferative signals in TEL-PDGFRB mediated MPD, we designed add-back constructs to co-express TEL-PDGFRB with either Stat5a ( TP i Stat5a ) or Stat5b ( TP i Stat5b ). Addback Stat5 restored MPD with similar disease latency in TP i Stat5a \u2192 Stat5a \u2212/\u2212 and TP i Stat5b \u2192 Stat5a \u2212/\u2212 mice (median survival 96 and 97 days, respectively). TP i Stat5a \u2192 Stat5a +/\u2212 mice developed MPD with shorter disease latency (28 days), again correlating with Stat5a gene dosage. These data provide functional evidence for the importance of the Stat5 pathway in a model of TEL-PDGFRB -induced CMML and suggest that Stat5a and Stat5b play unique roles in the development of disease in this model.",
