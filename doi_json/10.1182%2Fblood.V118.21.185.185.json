    "abstract_text": "Abstract 185 The immune system plays a key role in preventing and controlling tumor growth and metastasis. In overcoming endogenous anti-tumor immunity, cancers elicit a number of immunosuppressive networks.One key network is the blockade of myeloid progenitor - to - dendritic cell (DC) differentiation, resulting in loss of mature DC (critical in the induction of T cell mediated immune responses) and accumulation of immature, actively immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in cancer patients, thus compromising the ability to maintain existing and initiate novel anti-tumor immune responses. This is mediated by tumor derived factors (e.g. VEGF, IL-6) that inhibit DC differentiation by driving STAT3 hyperactivation. The downstream target(s) of this STAT3 signaling, however, have not been defined. Previous work in our lab has identified protein kinase C \u03b2II (PKC\u03b2II) as being essential in myeloid progenitor to DC differentiation and demonstrated that PKC\u03b2II inhibition prevents DC differentiation. These observations and others lead us to hypothesize that tumor driven activation of STAT3 inhibits DC differentiation by down regulating PKC\u03b2II expression. To determine if PKC\u03b2II expression in DC-progenitors is decreased by cancer, myeloid cells were enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (by lymphoid cell depletion) from stage III/IV breast cancer patients (known to have reduced numbers of DCs) and \u201cnormal\u201d age-matched donors and gene expression analyzed by qPCR. PKC\u03b2II levels in myeloid cells from cancer patients were significantly reduced versus \u201cnormal\u201d donors (on average reduced 62%, p < 0.05). This comports with previous in vitro work demonstrating that culture in tumor conditioned media (TCM) decreases PKC\u03b2II protein levels and significantly decreases PKC\u03b2II mRNA levels and promoter activity, and that this decrease in PKC\u03b2II expression was accompanied by significant impairments in DC differentiation in myeloid progenitor-like cell lines long used to model DC differentiation. We've previously shown that TCM drives STAT3 activation and that genetically activated STAT3 (courtesy of a constitutively active STAT3 mutant, CA-STAT3) significantly decreases PKC\u03b2II expression. To determine if STAT3 was acting directly on the PKC\u03b2 promoter to impair its activity, the promoter was analyzed in silico for STAT3 binding sites. This analysis uncovered 4 putative STAT3 binding sites in close proximity to one another and the start site of PKC\u03b2 transcription. To determine if STAT3 binds to any of these sites in response to TCM, quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation was conducted. TCM rapidly (within 15 minutes) drove >4-fold greater STAT3 binding to the PKC\u03b2 promoter (p < 0.05). To determine if this STAT3 binding was responsible for decreased PKC\u03b2 promoter activity, we generated reporter constructs containing site-specific mutations designed to ablate the putative STAT3 binding sites identified above. Elimination of site #4 (widely conserved among mammalian species) almost completely abrogated the ability of TCM or IL-6 or CA-STAT3 (see below) to inhibit PKC\u03b2 promoter activity, demonstrating that STAT3 binding to the PKC\u03b2 promoter negatively regulates PKC\u03b2 promoter activity and PKC\u03b2II expression. TCM contains many factors known to drive STAT3 activation, including high amounts of IL-6 (commonly greater than 100 ng/ml in our model). To determine if these effects are dependent on these high IL-6 levels, a myeloid progenitor cell line was cultured in TCM that had been pre-incubated with an IL-6 depleting antibody (TCM-\u03b1IL-6) or isotype control (TCM-iso). Cells grown in TCM-iso had decreased (approximately 50%) PKC\u03b2II levels compared both to cells grown in normal media and to cells grown in TCM-\u03b1IL-6, demonstrating that TCM driven PKC\u03b2II down regulation is IL-6 dependent (in this model). Furthermore, high levels of IL-6 significantly reduced PKC\u03b2 promoter activity (comparable to the affects seen with TCM;) in the dual luciferase reporter assay system (p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that tumors down regulate myeloid PKC\u03b2II expression by driving hyperactive STAT3 signaling, resulting in STAT3 binding to and negatively regulating the PKC\u03b2 promoter, resulting in impaired DC differentiation. These effects are mediated, at least in part, by IL-6. This work identifies several potential avenues to block or reverse tumor mediated suppression of DC differentiation in cancer.
