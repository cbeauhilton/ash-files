    "abstract_text": "A single somatic mutation, V617F, in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is one of the causes of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), including primary myelofibrosis, and the mutant kinase JAK2V617F is a therapeutic target in MPN. However, inhibition of wild-type JAK2 (JAK2WT) can decrease the red blood cell (RBC) or platelet count. Therefore, a JAK2 inhibitor that produces a smaller reduction in the RBC and platelet counts in the therapeutic window would have clinical benefit. NS-018 is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK2 and Src-family kinases which is currently in an early-phase clinical trial for MPN. To compare the inhibitory effect of NS-018 on JAK2WT and JAK2V617F in the cell, we assessed the antiproliferative activity of NS-018 against Ba/F3 cells expressing murine JAK2WT or JAK2V617F. NS-018 suppressed the growth of Ba/F3-JAK2V617F cells with an IC 50 value of 470 nM, whereas it suppressed the growth of Ba/F3-JAK2WT cells stimulated with IL-3 with an IC 50 value of 2000 nM. Thus, NS-018 showed 4.3-fold selectivity for Ba/F3-JAK2V617F over Ba/F3-JAK2WT cells (V617F/WT ratio). Other JAK2 inhibitors also showed selectivity for Ba/F3-JAK2V617F over Ba/F3-JAK2WT cells, though their selectivity was lower. For example, INCB018424 (ruxolitinib) and TG101348 showed V617F/WT ratios of 2.0 and 1.5, respectively. Among the eight JAK2 inhibitors tested, NS-018 showed the highest selectivity for JAK2V617F cells. NS-018 also inhibited erythroid colony formation in JAK2V617F transgenic mice at significantly lower concentrations than in wild-type mice. To assess the ability of NS-018 to selectively inhibit JAK2V617F-harboring cells in vivo , we established a JAK2V617F bone marrow transplantation (BMT) mouse model. NS-018 was administered by oral gavage twice a day for 40 days at a dose of 50 mg/kg. When assessment was carried out 50 days after the start of the study, NS-018 was found to have significantly prolonged the survival of JAK2V617F BMT mice, decreased their splenomegaly and restored their disrupted splenic architecture. NS-018 also partially suppressed bone marrow fibrosis in JAK2V617F BMT mice. All vehicle-treated mice that had survived to the study endpoint had mild-to-moderate reticulin fibrosis, whereas all mice treated with NS-018 had slight-to-little reticulin fibrosis, except for one mouse with mild fibrosis. Although vehicle-treated JAK2V617F BMT mice showed marked leukocytosis, NS-018 treatment achieved a 95% suppression of this increase. In spite of the marked effects of NS-018 in JAK2V617F BMT mice described above, NS-018 treatment had not decreased the RBC or reticulocyte count after 50 days of administration. JAK2V617F BMT mice showed a 78% decrease in the platelet count compared with control mice, and NS-018 treatment did not further decrease the count. To better understand the ability of NS-018 to preferentially inhibit the mutated form of JAK2, we explored the X-ray co-crystal structure of NS-018 bound to activated JAK2 and focused on the flipped carbonyl group of Gly933, which is located immediately N-terminal to the DFG (Asp-Phe-Gly) motif in the activation loop of JAK2. We identified two kinds of hydrogen-bonding interactions between NS-018 and the carbonyl group of Gly993: water-mediated hydrogen bonding involving a nitrogen atom of NS-018 and a CH\u2022\u2022\u2022O hydrogen bond involving an aromatic CH of NS-018. The unique mode of binding of NS-018 to activated JAK2 provides a plausible explanation for its JAK2V617F selectivity. In summary, NS-018 preferentially inhibited the growth of JAK2V617F-harboring cells over JAK2WT-harboring cells. NS-018 was also effective against leukocytosis, splenomegaly, and bone marrow fibrosis, and prolonged survival in JAK2V617F BMT mice with no reduction in the RBC or platelet counts. These characteristics of NS-018 may be explained at least in part by its unique mode of binding to the activated form of JAK2. NS-018 may have therapeutic benefit for MPN patients in virtue of its simultaneous satisfaction of the two requirements of efficacy and reduced hematologic adverse effects.
