    "abstract_text": "The assessment and management of pain and anxiety related to a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy (BM asp/bx) has received little attention, despite the frequent use of this procedure, and the availability of safe and rapid-acting IV anesthetics. We sought to quantify the severity of pain and anxiety associated with BM asp/bx and to test a protocol using anesthesiologist-administered IV Propofol to prevent procedure-related pain and anxiety. After signing an informed consent, 82 adult patients (pts) participated in the study. The first 45 pts received a BM asp/bx performed in the routine fashion (control cohort). The next 37 pts participated in the Pain-Free Bone Marrow Protocol and received IV Propofol during their procedure (intervention cohort). Each patient completed pre- and post- BM asp/bx surveys. Visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to measure pain and anxiety/concern. Analysis was performed on the total number of patients for whom complete data was available (Table 1 N=65; Table 2 N=70). A multi-departmental study team was necessary to support the Hematology practice change to incorporate the pain-free BM asp/bx option.

Patients in the intervention cohort had less concern regarding possible future BM asp/bx. A meaningful majority of patients would elect a pain-free BM asp/bx in the future if given the option. Our data demonstrate that BM asp/bx performed in the routine fashion is moderately painful and is associated with moderate pre-procedure anxiety. Our protocol using propofol anesthesia successfully reduced expected and experienced BM asp/bx-related pain for the current procedure and potential future procedures. In our sample, the majority of adult hematology patients would elect a pain-free bone marrow aspiration and biopsy procedure if given the option.",
