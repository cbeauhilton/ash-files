    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4981 Background. In the two International Prognostic Scoring Systems of Myelodysplastic Syndrom (MDS), the percentage of BLAST cells in the Bone Marrow is the most important parameter implicated in score: either directly in the IPSS (International Prognostic Scoring System) (1) or indirectly in the WPSS (Who classification-based prognostic scoring system) (2). In these two systems, as in the recommendations of the WHO 2001 (3), the morphological criteria defining blasts cells compared to promyelocyte cells are not specified. In 2005, the IWGM-MDS (International Working Group on Morphology of myelodysplastic syndrome) (4-6) has established morphological criteria defining Blasts cells. PURPOSE OF THE WORK. Our objective in this study is to evaluate the reproducibility, among five observers of our laboratory, of the counting of the marrow blasts of 73 myelodysplasia. Materials and Methods. This study was conducted in several stages. 1st step was to test the implementation of the MDS-Foundation ( http://www.mds- foundation.org/virtualmicroscopy ) by 5 observers. The 2nd step was to perform correlation test of the selected cells from RAEB (selected and stained in our laboratory conditions), for the 5 observers. Finally Step 3 was to assess the correlation of blast percentage of 73 bone marrow smears from MDS patients, selected due to the presence of an excess of blast cells in the first reading on the bone aspiration. Results. Our results show that the correlation on counting blasts is generally satisfactory (percentage agreement: Test 1 = 86% and test 2 = 94%), while the concordance on the counting blasts of bone marow smears of 73 MDS patients and concordance on the WHO classification seems less satisfactory (agreement 3/5 observers. = 95% but agreed to 4\u20135/5 observers = 64%). These results can be explained partly by the inter-observer variability and by the variability of some parameters specific to smear marrow (poor quality smears, the staining and/or poverty of smears). Conclusion. The evaluation of the blasts in the MDS must be achieved: (i) at least 500 cells counted (ii) by at least two different observers (iii) by a third observer in discordant case. Despite these recommendations, the assessment of the blasts in myelodysplasia is difficult to achieve in many cases. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
