    "abstract_text": "Background. The predictive value of assessment of minimal residual disease after induction treatment in follicular lymphoma (FL) is still controversial. Last year we published the results of a prospective randomized phase III intergroup trial evaluating the role of rituximab (R) both in remission induction and maintenance treatment of 465 relapsed /resistant FL patients. Major conclusions were that addition of R to CHOP induction yielded an increased ORR and CR rate, and that R maintenance strongly improved median progression free survival (PFS; both after induction with CHOP and R-CHOP) and overall survival when compared to observation ( van Oers et al Blood  2006 ; 108 : 3295 ). We now report on the Bcl-2/IgH PCR analysis in this study. Study design . Peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples where obtained before the start of the induction therapy, at the end of the induction therapy and at the end of the 2 years maintenance/ observation period. The percentage of Bcl-2/IgH MBR+ cells was quantified by genomic qPCR with a sensitivity of at least one Bcl-2/IgH MBR+ cell among 10,000 normal cells (primer and probe sequences are available on request. The main question of our analysis was whether the primary endpoints of the study (response rate /quality for the induction phase and PFS for the maintenance phase) were correlated with results of the Bcl-2/IgH PCR in PB or BM. Results. Molecular biology data were available from 250 patients, evenly distributed amongst the therapeutic arms, both for induction and maintenance. Before treatment 48.5% and 42.0% of assessable patients had a positive Bcl-2/IgH PCR in BM and PB respectively. At the end of induction this had decreased to 28.6% and 17.3% respectively, and at the end of maintenance/observation to 10.5% and 10.6%. Conversion of positive to negative values were more frequent with R-CHOP induction (BM: P=0.026 and PB: P=0.003), and with R maintenance (BM: P=0.005). Percentages and levels of Bcl-2/IgH positivity in PB and BM correlated well at the three sampling time points. Bcl-2/IgH PCR results at diagnosis did not predict for overall response or complete remission rates after induction treatment, but BM results predicted PFS (P=0.04). Rather surprisingly, Bcl-2/IgH PCR results of BM and PB at the end of induction treatment were not predictive for PFS: 3 years PFS was 46% and 38% in the BM\u2212 and BM+ group respectively (p=0.4), and 51% and 42% in the PB-and PB+ group respectively (p=0.4).The highly significant improvement of PFS by R maintenance versus observation was observed in both Bcl-2/IgH PCR PB/BM positive and negative groups. Finally, patients who still had a positive Bcl-2/IgH PCR in PB or BM at the end of the 2 years of R maintenance/observation had a significantly shorter PFS (from end of maintenance/observation) than those who were Bcl-2/IgH PCR negative. Conclusion: Bcl-2/IgH PCR results in BM or PB at the end of CHOP or R-CHOP induction treatment are not useful for decisions on subsequent therapy in patients with relapsed/resistant follicular lymphoma.",
