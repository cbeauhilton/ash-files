    "abstract_text": "Background: Acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)/ lymphoma (T-LBL) are immature T-cell malignancies with very poor outcomes. In patients with relapsed disease, survival is often < 12 months (Marks et al, Blood, 2009). Prognostic correlates and treatment outcomes after relapse remain largely unknown. Aims: To evaluate prognostic correlates and treatment outcomes in patients with relapsed T-ALL/LBL. Methods: After IRB approval, 92 consecutive patients with T-cell ALL/LBL were identified. 41 patients with relapsed disease after achieving a first complete remission (CR1) were included in the study group. Features at the time of relapse were retrospectively abstracted and analyzed. Survival time after relapse was calculated from the time of relapse until death or last follow-up. Conventional methods were used for statistical analysis. Results: A. Baseline characteristics of all patients 92 patients were identified [41 LBL, 51 ALL]. Median age was 33 years (range; 18-88) and 66 (72%) were males. Median follow-up was 25 months (range 0.9-260). 13(14%) received palliative care or were lost to follow-up before treatment initiation. At last follow-up, there were 41 (52%, n = 79) relapses and 42 (46%, n = 92) deaths. Of 79 patients, 71 (90%) achieved a CR1 and 8 (10%) had primary refractory disease. Comparisons between ALL and LBL revealed expected differences in presenting features such as frequency of primary mediastinal mass at presentation in LBL and high leukocyte count in ALL. Significant differences in treatment were seen. Asparaginase-based and ALL-directed therapy were more common in the ALL group (71% vs. 45%, p = 0.009; 88% vs. 71%, p = 0.04). 13 (81%) LBL and 14 (27%) ALL underwent allogeneic SCT. The remaining three in each group underwent autologous SCT in CR1. B. Characteristics of relapsed patients 41 relapsed after achieving CR1 [23 LBL, 18 ALL]. Median time to relapse was 8.0 months (range 2.3-130), with no difference between ALL and LBL groups. Median age was 34 years (range 19-71) and 29 (71%) were males. Median follow-up after relapse was 7.2 months (range 0.3-207). At time of last follow-up, there were 30 (73%) deaths, 25 (61%) achieved a second complete remission (CR2) and 14 (34%) had persistent disease. 12 (48%) had relapse following CR2. 34 (83%) relapsed following CR1 after induction chemotherapy alone. 6 (15%) and 1 (2%) relapsed following allogeneic and autologous SCT respectively. 27 (66%) had BM involvement, 5 (12%) had CNS involvement, 13 (32%) had mediastinal involvement, and 3 (7%) had isolated extramedullary relapse. Ten (43%) patients with LBL relapsed with ALL. Of 27 patients with available data, 9 (33%) had high-risk cytogenetics at relapse, defined as \u2265 5 chromosomal abnormalities and/or markers known to confer an unfavorable prognosis. 16 of these 27 patients had follow-up cytogenetic studies performed, of which 8 (50%) had evidence of clonal evolution. Patients were treated with up to five regimens. 12 (31%) received asparaginase-based therapy and 13 (33%) received nelarabine with CR2 rates of 75% and 25% respectively. Median number of regimens needed to achieve CR2 was one. 18 (46%) went onto SCT following CR2: 14 (allogeneic), 3 (autologous), and 1 (donor lymphocyte infusion). The majority received myeloablative conditioning (92%). C. Outcomes and prognostic correlates for survival after relapse Median survival following relapse was 8.2 months (IQR 4.1-21.3) and did not differ between LBL and ALL. Nine (36%) who achieved CR2 are alive at time of last follow-up. 25 (61%) achieved CR2, but 12 (48%) relapsed following CR2, with median time to second relapse of 7.6 months (IQR 4.7-14). Nine of 18 who underwent SCT following CR2 had disease relapse (8 allogeneic, 1 autologous). Only BM involvement at relapse significantly correlated with post-relapse survival (HR 2.4 [1.1, 5.1], p = 0.03). Clonal evolution, high-risk cytogenetics, nelarabine therapy, achieving CR2, and SCT were not independent predictors of survival in our small subset of patients. Conclusion: Patients with relapsed T-ALL/LBL have dismal outcomes, in spite of advances in therapy with newer agents such as nelarabine and the use of allogeneic SCT. Regardless of T-ALL/LBL subtype, BM involvement at relapse appears to be a significant factor negatively impacting post-relapse survival. Further studies are needed to validate these findings.
