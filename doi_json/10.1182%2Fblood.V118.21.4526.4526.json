    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4526 Introduction: Prolonged and persistent neutropenia (white blood cell (WBC) \u22641000/\u03bcL) after chemotherapy is associated with increased risk for infection in cancer patients and is often an indication for a diagnostic bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. A test that predicts WBC recovery \u2265 1000/\u03bcL and that obviates the need for marrow sampling would be of clinical value. The immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) reflects erythroid production and hence a recovering marrow. Materials and Methods: We identified 17 myeloma patients with prolonged pancytopenia after either myeloablative or non-myeloablative chemotherapy between March 2010 and February 2011, and compared the time of occurrence of IRF doubling (IRF-D) to the findings on bone marrow examination. Results: The time to IRF doubling preceded increase of WBC \u2265 1000/\u03bcL in 15 of 17 patients by a mean of 4.5 days (range 0\u201318 days). In two patients, the IRF-D coincided with WBC \u2265 1000/\u03bcL. The IRF doubled 2\u20134 days before the bone marrow examination in four patients and at a mean of 3.7 days (range 1\u201313 days) after the marrow examination in the remaining 13. Conclusion: We conclude that the IRF-D is a simple, inexpensive and widely available test that can precede marrow recovery by several days and may therefore obviate the need for a diagnostic bone marrow aspirate and biopsy in patients with prolonged and persistent neutropenia.
