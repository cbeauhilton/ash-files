    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4553 High dose (HD) therapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHCT) has been the mainstay of treatment in patients diagnosed with advanced neuroblastoma (NBL). Busulfan and Melphalan (Bu/Mel) was demonstrated to be superior to other HD regimens and is widely considered as standard treatment. (Ladenstein, Bone Marrow Transplant. 2008 Jun;41 Suppl 2:S118-27), Topotecan (Topo) with or without cyclophosphamide has demonstrated efficacy in treatment of advanced NBL (Kushner, Cancer 116: 3054, 2010). We hypothesize that adding Topo to Bu/Mel as HD therapy followed by AHCT is well tolerated and will result in favorable outcomes. Patients and Methods: Patients with NBL, stage III or IV were eligible and consented to participate in the study. Seven patients were enrolled, the median age was 2.65 yrs (range 2.3 \u2013 4.x yrs), and there were 4 males (57%). All patients were initially treated on COG protocols and in all cases a complete response was documented prior to proceeding with AHCT. Autologous hematopoietic cells were collected, following mobilization with G-CSF, after 2 (n=6) or 3 (n=1) cycles of chemotherapy. All patients were given post transplant radiation therapy to the primary tumor bed and cis-retinoic acid, 3 patients were also given monoclonal antibodies. Data on engraftment, toxicities, event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Results: The median cell dose was 6.62 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+/kg (5.57\u00d710 6 \u22127.33 \u00d7 10 7 ). Engraftment occurred promptly in all patients. Myeloid and platelet recovery occurred at a median of 12 (8\u201317 days) and 22 (17\u201341 days), respectively. The treatment was well tolerated with no grade 4 or higher toxicities. Grade 3 toxicities included; mucositis (n=7, 100%), electrolyte imbalance (n=3), diarrhea (n=3), autoimmune hemolysis (n=1) and epistaxis (n=1). Three patients suffered disease recurrence, 156, 821 and 899 days post AHCT. One patient is dead and two continue salvage therapy 55 and 52 months, post transplant, respectively. The 4-year OS and EFS were 87% to 57%, respectively. Conclusion: This novel regimen of Topo/Bu/Mel appears to be well tolerated with low TRM and promising EFS and OS. Further and larger studies are required to establish its role as HD therapy prior to AHCT in patients with advanced NBL. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
