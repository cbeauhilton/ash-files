    "abstract_text": "Modern flow cytometry techniques using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane proteins have revealed an increase in the proportion of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)-type cells in a varying (30 to 50) percentage of acquired aplastic anemia (AA) patients who do not manifest any signs of hemolysis. However, the clinical significance of such a small proportion of PNH-type cells remains uncertain because previous studies have used a variety of flow cytometric assays with different mAbs and different definitions of an abnormal increase in the proportion of PNH-type cells, and also, few studies have focused on the correlation of presence of increased PNH-type cells with response to immunosuppressive therapy (IST) based on a large number of newly diagnosed AA patients. We previously demonstrated, using two-color flow cytometry capable of precisely determining the proportion of PNH-type cells less than 0.1%, that such a minor population of PNH-type cells represents a reliable marker for presence of immune pathophysiology in refractory anemia patients ( Blood , 100 : 3897 \u20133902, 2002 ; Blood , 102 : 1211 \u20131216, 2003 ). To determine if the PNH-type cells serve as a marker for immune pathogenesis in AA as well, we examined peripheral blood in 99 newly diagnosed AA patients (67 severe AA and 32 moderate AA) for presence of CD55 \u2212 59 \u2212 CD11b + granulocytes and CD55 \u2212 59 \u2212 glycophorin A + RBCs and studied correlation of response to ATG + cyclosporine (CsA) therapy with presence of increased PNH-type cells. When the influence of time from blood collection until treatments of cells with mAbs on the outcome of PNH-type-cell detection were examined, the percentages of PNH-type cells remained unchanged for 2 days for granulocytes and for 6 days for RBCs from the time of blood collection. Minor (>0.003% for CD11b + granulocytes and >0.005% for glycophorin A + RBCs) population of PNH-type cells were detected in 66 (66.7%) patients. The proportions of PNH-type cells in patients with increased PNH-type cells (PNH + patients) were 0.005\u20130.01% in 10 (15.2%) patients, 0.01\u20130.1% in 20 (30.3%), 0.1\u20131.0% in 25 (37.9%), and 1.0\u20138.67% in 10 (15.2%). When clinical characteristics of PNH + patients were compared with that of PNH \u2212 patients, PNH + patients (mean, 54 year-old) were significantly older than PNH \u2212 patients (mean, 42 year-old, [Italic]P[/Italic]=0.042). 55 of 66 (83.3%) PNH + patients improved with IST and achieved PR or CR whereas 17 of 33 (52.9%) PNH \u2212 patients responded. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that PNH + patients had a significantly better chance of response to IST than PNH- patients ( Figure ). These results indicate that a minor population of PNH-type cells defined by the two-color flow cytometry represents a good marker for response to IST in AA patients. Since CD55 \u2212 59 \u2212 glycophorin A + RBCs less than 0.1% remain constant and detectable in blood stored at 4 ?C for up to 6 days, testing blood cells, particularly RBCs, using this sensitive flow cytometry is useful in identifying high responders to IST in AA patients.
