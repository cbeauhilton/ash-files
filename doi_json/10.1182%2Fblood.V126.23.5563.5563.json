    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Unfractionated heparin (UFH), or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), is commonly used with mechanical prophylaxis as an anticoagulant to reduce the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, overuse of these prophylaxes can increase the risk of bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and associated medical cost. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of DVT prophylaxis among hospitalized nonsurgical patients in a community medical center. To evaluate the use of the prophylaxes as described above, the investigators collected data on medical inpatients and addressed how to avoid overuse. Method: A retrospective inpatient chart review of 100 general internal medicine patients analyzed data using Padua Prediction Score as the risk estimate for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). High risk for VTE was defined by a cumulative score >=4 and low risk was a score <4. Only patients at increased risk for DVT but not at high risk for bleeding qualified for heparin treatment. Results : A total of 100 patients were surveyed. 54/100 (54%) patients had low risk of DVT with score < 4, and of those 29/54 (53.7%) patients received DVT prophylaxis with SCDs and/or heparin, and 17/54 (31.5%) patients were treated with heparin. All 46 patients with score >= 4 were treated with DVT prophylaxis of which 10 patients were only treated with heparin and 36 patients were given both mechanical and chemical prophylaxis. Collectively, 53.7% of the patients received treatment with DVT prophylaxis ( p < 0.001, Chi-Square test). Discussion: In hospital settings, physicians want to avoid DVT or PE so they tend to consider patients as being at moderate risk for DVT without using any method of DVT risk assessment. This leads to unnecessary overuse of DVT prophylaxis on patients and may increase the risk of bleeding and injury. Conclusion : Our data suggests that there DVT prophylaxis including UFH and LMWH was over prescribed among patients with who had marginal risk for DVT in hospitalized nonsurgical patients in a community medical center. Clinical implications: To avoid the overuse of DVT prophylaxis, physicians need to follow guidelines. Education and inclusion of the guidelines in EHRs of information on VTE risk assessment for hospitalized medical patients upon admission may reduce unneeded DVT prophylaxis and the risk of bleeding and costs associated with additional care needs.
