    "abstract_text": "Introduction : T cell lymphomas are a relatively rare and heterogeneous group of disease. Because of its rarity and diversity, most published data have been based on small, and single-center retrospective studies. Methods : Here, we conducted a multi-center, prospective registry study of non-Hodgkin T cell lymphoma. From April 2016 to Aug 2017, a total of 244 patients who were diagnosed as mature T cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma based on the World Health Organization Classification 2008 were enrolled (Korea, n=139; China, n=64; Taiwan, n=17; Indonesia, n=12; Singapore, n=5; Indonesia, n=12; Malaysia, n=7). Among them, data from 48 patients were only used in this interim analysis due to incomplete e-CRF or patients still on follow up. Results : The median age was 56 years (range, 31-79), and male and female patients were 33 (68.8%) and 15 (31.3%). Among the patients enrolled, extranodal NK T cell lymphoma was the most common disease accounting for 35.4% (n=17), and AITL (25.0%, n=12), PTCL (22.9%, n=11), ALCL (10.4%, n=5), EATL (4.2%, n=2) and Cutaneous T cell lymphoma (2.1%, n=1). At the time of diagnosis, disease of stage 1, 2, 3, and 4 were comprised 18.8% (n=9), 27.1% (n=13), 20.8% (n=10) and 33.3% (n=16), respectively. CHOP based regimen (CHOP or CHOEP) was most commonly used as 1 st line treatment, which comprised 75% of all regimens used except in the case of extranodal NK T cell lymphoma. Enrolled patients of extranodal NK T cell lymphoma with available treatment information (n=15), were treated with VIDL (+/- CCRT) (n=11, 73.3%), COEPL/LOP (n=2, 13.3%), DEVIC (n=1, 6.7%), and SMILE (n=1, 6.7%), respectively. Except patients whose treatment response to 1 st line therapy was unknown (n=9) or not evaluable (n=6), complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease were reported in 17 (43.6%), 3 (7.7%), 3 (7.7%) and 10 patients (25.6%). Overall, 10 patients proceeded autologous transplantation (20.8%), and 7 of whom underwent transplantation as an upfront treatment. At the data cut off time of Dec 2016, 38 patients were alive, 5 were dead and 5 were lost to follow-up. Median overall survival was not reached due to a short period of follow up (median 6.6 months). Conclusion : This study shows interim results of clinical response and patient outcome of non-Hodgkin T cell lymphoma in real world treatment practice. The study is still ongoing, and further data collection is needed to provide information useful for establishing effective treatment strategies (NCT 02691351). * Abbreviation: AITL, angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma; PTCL, peripheral T cell lymphoma; ALCL, anaplastic large cell lymphoma; EATL, Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma; T-LBL, T-lymphoblastic lymphoma; CCRT, concurrent chemo-radiotherapy * Treatment regimen: CHOP [cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone], CHOEP [cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide and prednisone], VIDL [etoposide, ifosfamide, dexamethasone, L-asparaginase], DEVIC [dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide and carboplatin], SMILE [Steroid (dexamethasone), Methotrexate, Ifosfamide, L-asparaginase and etoposide] Disclosures Kim: Kyowa-Kirin: Research Funding; Takeda: Research Funding; Donga: Research Funding; Celltrion, Inc: Consultancy, Honoraria; Novartis: Research Funding; J&J: Research Funding; Mundipharma: Research Funding; Roche: Research Funding.",
