    "abstract_text": "Twenty five patients have been enrolled on this trial to date. There were 14 males and 11 females aged 0.6\u201354 years. Patients\u2019 diagnoses and stage included: NHL in CR2 or refractory (n=2), AML (n=7), including 5 pts with secondary AML, ALL > CR3 (n=4), CML in CP2 (N=1) and high risk MDS (n=11) including 5 pts with secondary MDS. Eight pts had a matched related donor, 14 pts an unrelated donor and 3 pts a mismatched related donor. Cytoreduction consisted of busulfan (Bu) (0.8\u20131 mg/Kg/dose x 10 doses), melphalan (Mel) (70 mg/Kg/day x 2) and fludarabine (Flu) (25 mg/m2/day x 5). Graft rejection prophylaxis included rabbit ATG (Thymoglobulin) (2.5 mg/Kg/day x 2). Four pts tolerated only one of two doses of the ATG, 2 pts received equine ATG and one pt Alemtuzumab. Twenty one pts received G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cell transplants that were T-cell depleted by CD34 selection and E-rosetting while the other four pts received Soybean agglutinin E-rosette depleted marrow grafts. Cell doses were 1.3\u201320.5 x 10 6 CD34 cells/Kg. and 0 -100 x 10 3 CD3 cells/Kg. Engraftment occurred in 24 pts. One pt suffered a graft failure; This pt had initial low busulfan levels, and received bone marrow derived stem cells with a low cell dose from a 5/6 HLA-matched unrelated donor. Acute graft-versus-host disease occurred in four pts: grade 1 (n=2) and grade 2 (n=2) and no pts developed any grade 3-4 severe GvHD. Two patients were diagnosed with chronic GvHD: localized (n=1) and extensive (n=1). Two patients developed sepsis early post BMT, with secondary multi organ failure and early mortality, while for the rest of the patients, regimen-related toxicity was acceptable. Relapse occurred in 9 pts. Mortality included 7 pts from relapse, two pts from sepsis and multi-organ failure, 3 pts from infections, and one pt from unknown causes. The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 yrs for the entire patient cohort were respectively 44% and 42 %; The DFS was 50% for patients with secondary MDS or AML. In summary, the cytoreduction with Bu Mel and Flu allowed consistent engraftment of T-cell depleted grafts and was associated with acceptable outcome for patients with secondary MDS or AML."
