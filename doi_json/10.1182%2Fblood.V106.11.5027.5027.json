    "abstract_text": "Bortezomib (PS-341/Velcade\u2122) is a reversible inhibitor of the proteasome that has shown promising activity in clinical trials in several malignancies including multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, including those with refractory disease. However, results have been less encouraging in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and we have, therefore, sought to determine the barriers to effective therapy with bortezomib in this disease. Patients with CLL were eligible but were required to have received no therapy in the six months prior to the study. In a panel of 26 patients with CLL, both purified mononuclear cells and whole blood were tested for their apoptotic response to bortezomib (1\u2013100 nM) up to 24 h by flow cytometry and western blotting. In all cases, purified CLL cells were sensitive to bortezomib-induced apoptosis in a concentration and time-dependent fashion, irrespective of stage of disease, resistance to prior therapy, IGHV mutational status or the presence of TP53 mutations. Apoptosis was induced at low (>10 nM) nanomolar concentrations of bortezomib by activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Bortezomib-induced apoptosis correlated with levels of ubiquitination, Bax activation, and caspase cleavage. Apoptosis of CLL cells was obtained at drug levels readily obtained in vivo using currently-used dosing protocols. However, in vitro, it was necessary to maintain these concentrations for 16\u201324 hours to obtain maximal apoptosis. Apoptosis measured in a whole blood apoptosis assay was markedly less than in isolated lymphocytes at comparable time points and concentrations. Activity of bortezomib in purified cells was not diminished by addition of exogenous plasma but was abrogated by addition of autologous red blood cells (RBC), suggesting preferential active uptake of the drug by these cells. These data were confirmed in animal models showing preferential distribution of bortezomib to the RBC fraction. RBC uptake may therefore account for the low serum levels of bortezomib attained in vivo during terminal half-life and thus the lack of activity against cells in the peripheral blood. Together with pharmacokinetic and in vivo data, these studies suggest that different dosing schedules of bortezomib other than bolus injections may be more effective in patients with CLL.",
