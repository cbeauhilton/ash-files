    "abstract_text": "Objective To explore the regimen related toxicity (RRT) and the effects of super-intensified conditioning regimen combined with inducing graft versus leukemia (GVL) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for refractory leukemia which can\u2019t obtain complete remission (CR) pre- transplantation. Methods 18 patients who did not obtain CR before transplantation received super-intensity conditioning regimen protocol(experimental group), and 62 patients with acute leukemia who obtained CR or chronic myeloid leukemian (CML) who were in the chronic phase before transplantation received total body irradiation (TBI) plus cyclophosphamide (CTX) or modified BuCY (hydroxyurea, busulfan, Ara-C, CTX) protocol (control group). Cyclosporin A was reduced rapidly and gradually or donor lymphocytic infusion (DLI) was used to induced GVL if acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) did not happened in patients with refractory leukemia at 30 days post-transplantation. The incidence and mortality of RRT during transplantation, and the rate of CR, GVHD and leukemia relapse after transplantation was investigated. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis model was used to estimate the disease-free survival (DSF) rate at 3 years post-transplantation. Results Except one patient in experimental group and two patients in control group died of transplant-related complications, all the other patients obtained hematopoietic reconstitution.\u2019 the total RRT incidence were both 100% in two groups. The RRT of stomach intestine were most common in all the organs and the RRT incidence of experimental group and control group was 83.3% and 85.5%, respectively, in stomach intestine. The RRT incidence was 44.4% and 62.9% in oral cavity and 16.7% and 33.9% in bladder, respectively, in the experimental group and control group. There was no significance and P value was 0.823, 0.172 and 0.244, respectively, in the RRT incidence of stomach intestine, oral cavity and bladder between the two groups. The RRT mortality was 0 and 5%, respectively, and was not different (P=0.341) in the experimental and control group. Except one patient died of infection, all the other patients obtained CR in patients who were treated with supper-intensified conditioning regimen. The incidences of acute or chronic GVHD were 58.8% and 40.0% or 92.6% and 55.8%, respectively, in the experimental and control group. The incidence of leukemia relapse was 11.8% and 18.3%, respectively, in the two groups. The DSF at 3 years after transplantation was 61.2\u00b112.3% and 65.0\u00b17.4% (P=0.6311), respectively, in the two groups. Conclusion The consecutive super-intensified conditioning regimen combined with inducing GVL post transplantation protocol can increase the rate of CR and DFS, and dose not increase RRT incidence and mortality in allo-HSCT for the refractory leukemia which can\u2019t obtain CR pre- transplantation.",
