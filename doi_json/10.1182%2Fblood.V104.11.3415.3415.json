    "abstract_text": "NO induces differentiation and apoptosis in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) cells. Glutathione S-Transferases (GST) play an important role in multidrug resistance and are upregulated in 90% of AML cells. We have designed a novel prodrug class that releases NO on metabolism by GST. O 2 -(2,4-Dinitrophenyl) 1-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (JS-K, a member of this class) has potent antileukemic activity. We have previously shown that JS-K induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells by a caspase dependent mechanism ( Molecular Cancer Therapeutics  2 : 409 -417, 2003 ). The purpose of this study was to determine the pathway through which JS-K induces apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that treatment of HL-60 cells with JS-K (0 \u2013 1 \u03bcM) for 6 hours results in release of Cytochrome c from mitochondria in a dose dependent fashion. Treatment with JS-K resulted in a dose dependent activation of Caspase 9. Sixteen and 24 hours after exposure to 1 \u03bcM JS-K, Caspase 9 activity was induced by 393 \u00b1 93% and 237 \u00b1 13% of control, respectively (p = 0.03 at the 24 hours time point). Treatment with JS-K resulted in a dose dependent activation of Caspase 3. Twenty four hours after exposure to 1 \u03bcM JS-K, Caspase 3 activity was 208 \u00b1 3.4 % of control (p = 0.02). Treatment with JS-K also resulted in a dose dependent activation of Caspase 8, but to a lesser extent than Caspase 9 and 3. Twenty four hours after exposure to 1 \u03bcM JS-K, Caspase 8 activity was 144 \u00b1 5.3 % of control (p = 0.04). We conclude that JS-K activates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in leukemia cells by inducing the release of Cytochrome c from mitochondria. (NO1-CO-12400).",
