    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Fanconi anemia (FA) is the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndrome. FA patients develop bone marrow failure during the first decade of life, and frequently require an allogeneic or unrelated donor bone marrow transplant. FA patients also develop other hematologic manifestations, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) due to clonal evolution. FA is caused by biallelic mutation in one of eighteen FANC genes, the products of which cooperate in the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway and regulate cellular resistance to DNA cross-linking agents. Bone marrow failure in FA is attributable to an impaired hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) pool. HSPCs in FA patients and FA mice exhibit reduced cell number and compromised stem cell function. Recent studies suggest that bone marrow failure in FA and impaired HSPC function result from the genotoxicity of endogenous cross-linking agents or from physiological stress. A greater understanding of the mechanisms of impairment of HSPC function could improve the therapeutic options for FA patients. Using a whole genome-wide shRNA screen, we have recently identified that the canonical transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) pathway plays an important growth suppressive role in FA and targeting this pathway can reduce the genotoxic stress-induced growth inhibition of FA cells. Here, we investigated the possible suppressive function of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway in HSPCs derived from patients with FA. Methods: We performed in vitro colony-forming assays using primary FA patient- derived bone marrow CD34+ cells which were either transduced with shRNA targeting SMAD3 or treated with the anti-human TGF-\u03b2 neutralizing antibody GC1008. FA-like HSPCs were generated by stably knocking down FANCD2 with lentivirus encoded shRNA in primary human cord blood CD34 + cells. An in vivo engraftment assay was performed by transplanting the FA-like HSPCs into irradiated NSG mice. Results: The primary human FA bone marrow cells displayed elevated mRNA expression of multiple TGF-\u03b2 pathway components. The TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibition, by knockdown of SMAD3 or anti-human TGF-\u03b2 neutralizing antibody GC1008, rescued the in vitro clonogenic defects of primary CD34+ cells from bone marrow of five different FA patients. Similarly, the TGF-\u03b2 pathway disruption by depletion of SMAD3 or GC1008 antibody in primary FA-like HSPCs, also rescued their clonogenic defect, and partially restored genotoxic stress-induced growth inhibition. Further, as the very low number of CD34+ cells in FA patients did not allow efficient xenograft assay to analyze in vivo clonogenicity, we performed a surrogate in vivo xenograft assay using FA-like primary CD34+ cells. Importantly, blockade of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway by GC1008 antibody treatment enhanced the engraftment potential of primary FA-like CD34+ cells in vivo . Collectively, these results demonstrated that increased TGF-\u03b2 pathway signaling impairs the hematopoietic function of primary human FA HSPCs. Conclusions: The TGF-\u03b2 pathway signaling is increased in primary FA patient-derived hematopoietic cells and blockade of this pathway can restore the function of human FA-deficient primary HSPCs. The TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway-mediated growth suppression may account, at least in part, for bone marrow failure in FA. This work suggests that the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway provides a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of bone marrow failure in FA.
