    "abstract_text": "Background: Blood products transfusion is universally the most executed procedure in hospitals around the world. Still there is a general lack of interest among the physicians in training, both at undergraduate and postgraduate level. A lot more enthusiasm development is needed to motivate medical students to get interested in making TM their future career. In fact medical students are not taught enough during undergraduate courses. International studies have indicated that there is often little exposure to TM beyond 1-2 lectures in undergraduate medical training. Our regional anecdotal observations at undergraduate level had indicated that the students, inducted with different educational background (bachelor in biochemistry, pharmacy, dental health, radiology and medical laboratory) were not motivated enough to get involved on-the-bench and in the donation area, eventually reflecting in a poor performance in the examinations when it comes to TM questions. Methods: In this prospective study involving 22 volunteering year 4 medical students, we investigated that if motivational didactic lectures by senior faculty members at undergraduate level can enhance enthusiasm level for TM related training among our students. During motivational talk, emphasis was placed on wide scope and opportunities in TM field. We also tested the basic essential knowledge related to transfusion medicine focused on pre-transfusion testing, blood donation and informed consent procedure in Results: Among 22 medical students, median pre-test score was 6.75 (Range 3-9), median post-test score was 9.75 (Range 6.5-10) & the median percentage positive change in the score was 22.5% (Range 0-60 %). Detailed analysis revealed that students with medical laboratory background at the time of admission to medical school had the least change in the score. In post-talk assessment all of the respondents indicated that they were motivated to do a proactive rotation in blood bank. All respondents also showed their enthusiasm to work on the bench (blood grouping, cross-matching, antibody screen and DAT), participate in donor history questionnaire assessment of responses, and attending complete blood donation process. Conclusion: We demonstrate effectiveness of motivational didactic multi-media teaching by senior faculty member in enhancing enthusiasm level for TM related training among the students at our place. We recommend that transfusion medicine specialists should gain expertise in medical education and collaborate with colleagues who are experts in medical education. We like to disseminate our results to make changes in standardized curriculum and to improve teaching strategies. TM leaders should come forward to enhance enthusiasm level for TM related training among medical students to prevent extreme shortages of TM specialists in future.
