    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1999 Recurrent chromosomal translocations involving the IGH locus are characteristic of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and MALT lymphoma in particular has been pathologically characterized by specific IGH translocations. However, these translocations are present in only a subset of cases, suggesting that additional uncharacterized translocations might exist. In previous studies we characterized the novel t(X;14)(p11.4;q32) translocation in a patient with MALT lymphoma and found that GPR34 , an orphan G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), was highly expressed due to its juxtaposition to the IGHSA2 switch region. Although the t(X;14)(p11;q32) translocation was only identified in one patient, we wanted to determine its expression across a spectrum or normal and malignant lymphoma tissue, as other mechanisms may contribute to overexpression of genes. We measured GPR34 mRNA expression by quantitative PCR in tissue biopsies from a panel of lymphomas. As controls, we also measured GPR34 mRNA expression in normal resting or activated CD19 + B cells, resting and activated CD3 + T cells, and CD14 + monocytes. Expression of GPR34 was significantly increased in MALT (37-fold, n=35), LPL (23-fold, n=23), nodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma (18-fold, n=21), and splenic marginal zone B cell lymphoma (21 fold, n=33) compared to resting CD19 + B cells (n=11). In a gastric MALT lymphoma specimen we detected GPR34 expression at levels similar to the t(X;14)(p11;q32) patient and interphase FISH studies showed an extra intact GPR34 signal, but no translocation involving IGH or GPR34 , suggesting that other mechanisms, including gene dosage effect, can upregulate GPR34 . The receptor encoded by GPR34 is most similar to the PY2 receptor subfamily of GPCRs and signaling studies suggest that overexpression of GPR34 results in an accumulation of inositol phosphates and MAP-kinase activation. To further characterize the impact of GPR34 overexpression on cell signaling, HeLa cells were transduced with WT GPR34, a signaling deficient GPR34 (GPR34 DRY), or a vector control. To determine if MAPK activity was upregulated, the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 in GPR34 WT, GPR34 DRY, and vector control cells was analyzed and we found that ERK1/2 was constitutively phosphorylated at higher levels (1.6-fold) in GRP34 WT cells compared to GRR34 DRY or vector control cells. To further explore which signaling pathways were affected by GPR34 overexpression, GPR34 WT or vector control cells were transfected with an AP-1, CRE, NF-kB, E2F, SRE, NFAT, or ISRE- luciferase reporter plasmid. GPR34 expressing cells had increased luciferase activity driven by AP-1 (5.35-fold), CRE (4.7-fold), NF-kB (2.6-fold), and E2F (2.1) when compared to vector control cells. GPR34 DRY was unable to activate these pathways. AP-1 and CRE have been implicated in a large variety of cellular processes, including transformation, and both AP-1 and CRE activity is induced upon activation of MAP kinases. In untreated cells, both AP-1 and CRE activity were significantly higher in GPR34 WT cells compared to GPR34 DRY cells and both AP-1 and CRE luciferase activity was inhibited by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, suggesting that activation of these pathways is MAP-kinase dependent. To determine the biologic impact of GRP34 overexpression, the proliferation rates of vector control, GPR34 WT, and GPR34 DRY cells were compared and we found that proliferation of GPR34 WT cells was significantly higher (5.6-fold) than that seen in GPR34 DRY cells. We next tested the effect of the MEK inhibitor on proliferation and saw a dose dependent decrease in proliferation of GPR34 WT expressing cells. These results suggest that GPR34-mediated proliferation is dependent on MAPK. The presence of elevated GPR34 expression in tumors and the increased proliferation mediated by GPR34 suggests that it may have oncogenic potential. We therefore tested the ability of GPR34 WT cells to generate tumors in a tumor colony-forming assay. Only the GRP34 WT cells had the ability to form tumors in soft agar suggesting that overexpression of GPR34 can result in tumor formation. Taken together, our results identify a novel translocation in MALT lymphoma, emphasize a novel role for GPR34 in tumor cell growth, and suggest that MEK inhibitors may be useful in a subset of translocation-harboring or GRP34 high-expressing tumors.
