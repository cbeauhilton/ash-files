    "abstract_text": "The cyclic AMP Response Element Binding Protein, CREB, is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that induces genes that regulate cell proliferation and survival. CREB is a downstream target of GM-CSF signaling pathways in myeloid cells, resulting in transactivation of critical target genes. We previously demonstrated that both CREB protein and mRNA levels are increased in the bone marrow cells of patients with AML at diagnosis. In contrast, CREB is expressed at low levels in normal bone marrow cells. To examine the expression of CREB in specific bone marrow and leukemia stem cell populations, we performed quantitative real-time PCR. AML blast cells were sorted and were shown to have increased CREB mRNA expression in CD34+CD33+ and CD34-CD33+ population compared to normal bone marrow progenitor cells. To understand the role of CREB in normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis, we created transgenic mice in which the myeloid specific hMRP8 promoter controls CREB expression. Within months, these mice developed increased monocytes and neutrophils in the peripheral blood. The increased cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow were Gr1+Mac1+. We did not observe increases in other cell lineages using FACS analysis and the markers, B220, CD3, and Ter119. Bone marrow cells from CREB transgenic mice displayed increased colony size, greater numbers of colonies, and immortalization in colony replating assays with methylcellulose containing IL-3, IL-6, and Stem Cell Factor, compared to age-matched littermate controls. Bone marrow from CREB transgenic mice grew in the absence of cytokines, demonstrating factor-independent growth. Increased numbers of CFU-M was observed with CREB transgenic mouse bone marrow in colony assays with methylcellulose containing M-CSF. Although the mice did not develop acute leukemia, 7 out of 8 CREB transgenic mice compared to 0 out of 13 control mice developed enlarged spleens and myeloproliferative disease (MPD) after 12 months of age. Histology of the spleens showed destruction of the normal architecture with aberrant myeloid cells, suggestive of a myeloproliferative disease/myelodysplastic syndrome. Both the indolent course and phenotype of our mice were similar to Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) observed in humans. Interestingly, myeloid cells from patients with CML in chronic phase also express higher levels of CREB. Studies are underway to characterize CREB expression in peripheral blood or bone marrow cells from patients with MPD/MDS, including CML, CMML, and transient myeloproliferative disease of Down Syndrome. We are also analyzing the spleens from CREB transgenic mice that develop MPD/MDS. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of CREB is sufficient to induce myeloid cell transformation to a preleukemic state in vivo. Therefore, the CREB transgenic mouse provides a useful model to test novel therapies to treat MPD/MDS.",
