    "abstract_text": "Background: The painful crises of sickle cell disease (SCD) are characteristically localized to the skeleton. Various lines of evidence suggest that bone and bone marrow (BM) infarction contribute to the pathophysiology of such pain in which sickled red blood cells (SRBC) are believed to play a part. However, there is little information about the morphological characteristics and role of SRBC in BM during the crises or indeed, in the \u201csteady state\u201d. Occasional light microscopic observations in the BM of SCD patients show numerous markedly distorted cells, presumed to be SRBC, types of which have not been previously reported from this site or the peripheral blood (PB). We therefore studied a series of BM biopsies from SCD patients to determine whether such changes are consistently present. Methods: We microscopically reviewed archival BM biopsies from SCD patients for abnormally shaped RBC and compared the findings with SRBC on Wright-stained smears of PB collected simultaneously with the biopsies. The material consisted of Wright-Giemsa stained smears of aspirated BM and hematoxylin-eosin stained histological sections of clotted aspirate and / or trephine biopsies. We also examined fresh BM RBC by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (EM). We determined the relationship between the percentage of SRBC in BM and PB on the one hand, and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels on the other. Results: We studied the BM of 43 SCD patients. By LM, we observed markedly distorted RBC in the BM of the majority of patients who also had BM SRBC that were more typical forms. The distorted forms included vastly elongated erythrocytes, measuring up to 40 microns in length and less than 1 micron in width, some fixed into rod like structures, but others as sinuous, snake-like forms that have not been previously described. Scanning EM appearances also confirmed the features observed by LM. By contrast, none of PB samples showed similarly distorted SRBC. Although the percentage of typical SRBC in BM was concordant with that in the PB (p<0.001) SRBC numbers in both PB and BM were inversely proportional to the level of HbF.(Table 1) Conclusion: We conclude that the proportions of markedly distorted SRBC present in the BM of SCD patients are inversely proportional to HbF level and may thus play a pathogenetic role in the localization of severe pain to the skeleton during painful crises.
