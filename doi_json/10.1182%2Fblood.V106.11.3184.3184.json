    "abstract_text": "There is a paucity of pharmacokinetic (PK) data about hydroxyurea (HU) in persons with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and none in very young children. HU clearance is predominantly renal. The kidney may be damaged during infancy in SCA, but the first abnormality is usually hyperfiltration which may lead to enhanced HU clearance. Following a 15 mg/kg oral dose of commercially available HU capsules, PKs in 7 adults with SCA and normal renal function have been reported to be a mean\u00b1SD half-life (T1/2) of 3.14\u00b10.9 hrs, a maximal concentration (Cmax) of 28.32\u00b111.0 ug/mL, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 81.66\u00b115.5 ug\u2022hr/mL. The Phase II Study of HU in adults concluded that initial 2 hour clearance of HU was not associated with either the maximum tolerated dose or fetal hemoglobin response to treatment. However, the AUC did predict HU toxicity and, in another study, the need for dose adjustment in adults with SCA and renal insufficiency. BABY HUG is an NHLBI-NICHD sponsored Pediatric Phase III Clinical Trial designed to critically assess the efficacy of a novel liquid HU preparation in preventing organ damage in young children with SCA. Forty-five African-American infants, 12 to 18 months (mo) of age (mean 14.7 mo) were recruited without regard to disease severity to the just completed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled BABY HUG Feasibility and Safety Pilot Trial. First dose PKs were obtained 0, 1, 2, and 4 hours after oral administration of 20 mg/kg of HU in 22 consecutive patients (mean age 14.5 mo), coincident with measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by nuclear medicine DTPA clearance. An additional PK sample was obtained between 4 and 8 hours in 15 of the 22 (68%). Samples were frozen at \u221270\u00b0C, shipped, and assayed by high resolution gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (limit of detection 0.5 ug/mL). The T1/2 (2.36\u00b10.99 hrs), Cmax (19.81\u00b15.8 ug/mL; 0.26\u00b10.8 uM/L), and AUC (68.82\u00b111.5 ug\u2022hr/mL) were somewhat lower in BABY HUG patients than in the small group of adults with SCA from the literature. There were no apparent relationships between PKs and baseline GFR measured by DTPA or calculated from the Schwartz equation. Younger patients \u226415 mo (n=15) had a trend toward a shorter T1/2 (2.1 vs 2.8 hours; p=0.118) and a lower predicted measurable HU concentration at 8 hours (1.2 vs 2.1 ug/mL; p=0.056) than those 16\u201318 mo (n=7). There were no age related differences in AUC (67.4 vs 71.8 ug\u2022hr/mL; p=0.421) or Cmax (20.5 vs 18.2 ug/mL; p=0.409). PKs of this novel liquid preparation of HU in young children with SCA may be different than that of adults with the standard capsule formulation. The BABY HUG Trial will continue to refine the PK model by additional evaluations including samples from patients as young as 9 mo of age, the new lower age of eligibility for the open study currently accruing patients.",
