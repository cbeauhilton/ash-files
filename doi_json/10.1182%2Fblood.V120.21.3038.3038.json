    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3038 Background: After allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is highly prevalent in recipients. Although the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) genes are mainly regarded as pivotal negative feedback regulators for signaling of cytokines, the expression pattern of SOCS genes in CMV infections remains largely unexplored. To understand the molecular mechanism of cytokine cascades associated with CMV infection, we investigated the expression of SOCS genes from various types of hematologic malignancies after allogeneic HSCT. Methods: In the present study, we investigated SOCS1 and SOCS3 gene expressions, in order to examine the feasibility of SOCS genes as a promising therapeutic target as well as a prognostic predictor in CMV infection. A total of 99 recipients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; n=64), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n=23), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n=12), who received allogeneic HSCT and 55 normal donors were included. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) was used and all sample analyses were performed in triplicate. Results: The expression levels of the SOCS3 gene were clearly decreased in recipients compared to normal donors, including in the Pre-HSCT, Post-HSCT No CMV, and Post-HSCT CMV subgroups ( P =0.0007, P =0.0009, and P =0.0014, respectively). Meanwhile, expressions of SOCS1 gene were significantly decreased in the Pre-HSCT, Post-HSCT No CMV, and normal donors, when compared to Post-HSCT CMV subgroup ( P =0.026, P =0.0129, and P <0.0001, respectively), suggesting a correlation between expression of SOCS genes and CMV reactivation. In addition, expression of SOCS1 gene was remarkably increased in patients who received allogeneic HSCT with myeloablative conditioning (MAC), compared to reduced-intensity conditioning transplantation (RIST) and normal donors ( P =0.0119, P =0.0002, respectively), while, both regimen with MAC and RIST showed a decreasing pattern with statistical significance compared to normal donors ( P =0.0037, P =0.0024, respectively). Notably, SOCS1 gene expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome recipients were higher than acute myelogenous leukemia, when compare to normal donors ( P =0.0239). Furthermore, high expression of SOCS1 gene unarguably showed high mortality ( P =0.0068). In AML patients, decreased SOCS3 gene was detected ( P =0.0007) and overall high expression of SOCS3 gene was displayed high mortality, but there is no statistical significance. Conclusions: We firstly report that the SOCS genes are differently expressed in human CMV infection after allogeneic HSCT, suggesting a correlation between cytokines by modulation of SOCS genes associated with CMV reactivation. This result provides a new platform for studying CMV immunobiology and these genes may be a potential of diagnostic and therapeutic targets in post-allogeneic HSCT associated with CMV infection.
