    "abstract_text": "Abstract 40 Treatment of Hemophilia A patients with inhibitors is challenging, as correlation between inhibitor level and hemostatic response to therapy may be limited. Thrombin generation (TG) assays may be used to monitor hemostasis and/or predict patients' response to various bypass agents. Since combination of excess FVIII and bypassing agents may potentiate improved TG in inhibitor plasma tested in-vitro, we aimed to define the therapeutic feasibility of co-administration of rFVIIa and FVIII in hemophilia A patients with inhibitors. Patients and Methods: Following consent, blood was sampled from 15 hemophilia patients (age: 0.5\u201346y) with inhibitor (0.5\u2013668 BU). Platelet poor plasma (PPP) was prepared, spiked and incubated with excess FVIII. Ex-vivo kinetics of FVIII neutralization over time was evaluated by sequential measurements of residual FVIII activity. We then used recalcification induced-TG (performed in PPP supplemented with 4\u03bcM phospholipids), to measure the ex-vivo response to increasing concentrations of FVIII (0\u2013200%) and rFVIIa (0\u20136.8\u03bcg/ml), alone or in combination. Based upon these ex-vivo studies, an individually tailored therapeutic regimen of concomitant bolus doses of rFVIIa and FVIII was applied to nine hemophilia patients with inhibitors. Results: FVIII ex- vivo measurements post incubation detected either rapid or slow neutralization- not correlating with inhibitor level. Flat baseline TG curves were recorded for all inhibitor patients, with variable responses to FVIII and/or rFVIIa. Combined spiking with FVIII and rFVIIa dramatically increased rFVIIa induced ETP (762.7 \u00b1305.7 as compared to 339.3\u00b1179.9 nM/min with rFVIIa only) and peak height (48.7\u00b123.6 vs 23.7\u00b116.6) in all patients' plasma samples. Based upon individual ex vivo assays, concomitant bolus doses of rFVIIa (120\u2013200 mcg/kg) and FVIII (50\u2013100 U/Kg), were applied to 9 patients, for a total of 333 episodes during study period (February 2010-Septemeber 2012). Patients during immune tolerance received rFVIIa prophylaxis with combined rFVIIa/FVIII dosing applied 3 times weekly. For most mild- moderate joint bleeds hemostasis was defined as satisfactory following a single combined dose. Severe bleeding episodes or target joint bleeds responded to 2\u20138 (median:3) combined doses, applied every 12 hours. During study period the median number of spontaneous joint bleeds decreased from 4 to 1 per month. Neither thrombosis nor any other complications evolved. Conclusions: Prediction of individual therapy response may be achieved by pre-analytical studies, assessing FVIII neutralization kinetics as well as ex-vivo TG responses to combined bypass/FVIII therapy. Such studies enabled treatment of inhibitor patients according to individually tailored regimens. We confirmed for the first time that the in- vitro advantage of combining FVIII and rFVIIa, indeed accounts for improved hemostasis and may safely be applied to inhibitor patients.
