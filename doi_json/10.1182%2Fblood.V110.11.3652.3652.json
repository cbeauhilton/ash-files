    "abstract_text": "Recent studies have shown that Src-family kinases (SFKs) play an important role in mediating integrin signaling. \u03b1IIb\u03b23 has been shown to interact with multiple SFK members. We analyzed the role of Fyn in \u03b1IIb\u03b23-signaling and hemostasis. Fyn associated with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in resting as well as thrombin aggregated platelets. In contrast, the interaction between \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and another SFK member, cSrc, was seen predominantly in resting but not in thrombin aggregated platelets. Based on this difference, we explored if the Fyn \u2212 / \u2212 mice exhibit any abnormalities in hemostasis and platelet function. Fyn \u2212 / \u2212 mice had significantly prolonged second bleeding times compared to wild-type (WT) controls (3.61 min for Fyn \u2212 / \u2212 compared to 1.04 min for WT mice, n=11). Platelets from Fyn\u2212/\u2212 mice also exhibited delayed spreading on fibrinogen coated surfaces. Fyn, but not cSrc, localized to focal adhesions in CHO cells adherent to fibrinogen via \u03b1IIb\u03b23, and association of Fyn and cSrc depends on different segments of the cytoplasmic tail of the \u03b23 subunit in this model cell system In the CHO cell system, Fyn mediated \u03b1IIb\u03b23-dependent cell spreading in the absence of Rho-GTPase recruitment. Using mutant forms of Fyn, we found that its kinase activity is required for its localization to focal adhesions and to mediate \u03b1IIb\u03b23-dependent cell spreading. These results show previously unidentified roles for Fyn in \u03b1IIb\u03b23-signaling and hemostasis.",
