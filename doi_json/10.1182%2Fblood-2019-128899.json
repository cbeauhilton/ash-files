    "abstract_text": "The circulating tumor cells of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are characterized by variably low surface IgM (sIgM) levels and signaling capacity, consequent to stimulation by tissue-based antigen. The variability is evident in both CLL subsets with unmutated and mutated immunoglobulin genes and affects tumor cell survival and proliferation. This appears clinically important because CLL with relatively higher sIgM levels/signaling capacity progress more rapidly than those with lower sIgM levels/signaling capacity ( D'Avola, Blood 2016 ), likely due to a larger proliferative component at tissue sites. B-cell receptor (BCR)-signaling inhibitor ibrutinib exerts its therapeutic activity in CLL by irreversibly binding the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) at Cys481 in the active site. This leads to redistribution of CLL cells from tissue sites into peripheral blood and to a selective recovery of sIgM levels and function, consequent to release from antigen drive at tissue sites ( Drennan, Clin Cancer Res 2019 ). We have now investigated the hypothesis that sIgM levels on the CLL cells affect duration of response to ibrutinib therapy possibly consequent to circumvention of the pharmacological BTK inhibition. Seventy CLL patients participating in the \"real-world\" observational study at the University of Southampton (NIHR/UKCRN ID: 31076) were investigated for phenotypic, molecular and functional characteristics associated with response to single-agent ibrutinib. Time to progression requiring a new treatment from ibrutinib start (TTNT) was used as primary endpoint to measure duration of response. The levels of sIgM were measured by flow cytometry. Anti-IgM induced signaling was determined by immunoblotting or iCa 2+ mobilization. BTK and PLC\u03b32 mutations were determined using the Illumina NexteraXT kit and a MiSeq at the University of Southampton and validated independently at Karolinska Institutet. Our previous cut-offs of 50 (MFI) or 5 (iCa 2+ % mobilization) were used to distinguish patients with high/low sIgM levels or signaling capacity, respectively. Median follow-up from ibrutinib start was 42 months (range 12-70). Pre-ibrutinib sIgM levels (range 7-618, median 65; high sIgM MFI 46/70, 66%) and sIgM signaling capacity (range 1-98; median 45; high sIgM signalers 56/70, 80%) were broadly heterogeneous. However, median values were significantly higher than the general CLL population at diagnosis, as expected in progressive CLL. By univariate analyses of clinical, phenotypic, FISH and immunogenetic characteristics for TTNT, high sIgM was the only parameter predicting shorter duration of response to ibrutinib (p=0.02). Only 2/24 CLL with low sIgM levels (CLL IgM_lo ) had progressed (median TTNT not reached) compared to 15/46 CLL with high sIgM (CLL IgM_hi , 14% at 12 months, 18% at 24 months, 34% at 36 months, 44% at 42 months) during therapy. The levels of sIgM correlated significantly with sIgM signaling capacity prior to treatment ( r= 0.68; p <0.0001) and were selectively maintained during ibrutinib therapy. From in vitro analysis of 13 therapy-naive CLL samples, the degree of inhibition by ibrutinib of anti-IgM induced signals downstream to BTK correlated negatively with sIgM levels (r=-0.68,p=0.01) and signaling (r=-0.71,p=0.009). Anti-IgM induced signals were then measured in 12 patients (7 CLL IgM_hi , 5 CLL IgM_lo ) after 1, 4 and 12 weeks of ibrutinib therapy. These patients had not acquired BTK or PLC\u03b32 mutations and BTK phosphorylation appeared completely inhibited at all time-points. Mean anti-IgM induced iCa 2+ mobilization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were significantly reduced but not abolished during therapy and degree of inhibition was variable between individuals. Remarkably, degree of inhibition of anti-IgM-induced iCa 2+ mobilization and pERK1/2 was significantly lower in CLL IgM_hi than in CLL IgM_lo (p<0.05 at all time-points). These results confirm that sIgM signaling is dependent on sIgM levels and that it can circumvent BTK blockade when sIgM levels are high. They suggest that high sIgM signaling can drive ibrutinib resistance despite ability of ibrutinib to fully occupy the BTK phosphorylation pocket. A possibility is that those CLL cells with high sIgM represent a potentially dangerous subpopulation equipped to migrate to tissue and to receive proliferative stimuli. These cells might be targeted by a combinatorial therapeutic approach with ibrutinib.
