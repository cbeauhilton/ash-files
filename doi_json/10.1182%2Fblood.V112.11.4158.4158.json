    "abstract_text": "We analyzed the correlation between well-established biological parameters of prognostic relevance in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] (i.e, mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region [IgV H ], ZAP-70\u2212 and CD38\u2212 expression) and serum levels of BAFF (B-cell activating factor of the TNF family) by evaluating the impact of these variables on the time to first treatment [TFT] in a series of 125 previously untreated Binet stage A B-cell CLL patients. By using a commercial ELISA (R & D Systems, USA) we found that higher levels of BAFF characterized more frequently females (P=0.01), patients with Rai stage 0 (P=0.03), mutated IgV H disease (P=0.008) and low ZAP-70 expression (P=0.04). In contrast, age (P=0.35), peripheral blood lymphocytosis (PBL)(P=0.09), hemoglobin (Hb) level (P=0.64), platelet (PLT) count (P=0.12), serum \u03b2 2 -m (P=0.49), LDH (P=0.85) and percentage of CD38-positive B-CLL cells (P=0.63) did not reflect circulating levels of BAFF. We used an optimal cut-point search to determine how to best split soluble BAFF data. Maximally selected log-rank statistics plots identified a BAFF serum concentration of 311 ng/mL as the best cut-off (P 20% (P=0.02) and absence of mutation of IgV H (P<0.0001) as predictor of shorter TFT. In multivariate analysis only soluble BAFF (Hazard ratio [HR], 6.13; CI 95%, 2.31\u201316.25) and mutational status of IgV H, (HR= 2.99; CI 95% 1.33\u20136.76, P=0.008) maintained their discriminating power. The effects of BAFF on TFT were masked by mutational status of IgV H in patients with unmutated IgV H . However, serum levels of BAFF and mutational status of IgV H had a joint effect on TFT in patients with mutated IgV H which translates into a segregation of patients with mutated IgV H in two groups with different TFT according to BAFF levels (HR= 8.9; P<0.0001). Our results indicate that in early B-cell CLL biological profile including among other parameters soluble BAFF may provide a useful insight into the complex interrelationship of prognostic variables. Furthermore, BAFF along with mutational status of IgV H can be adequately used to predict clinical behaviour of patients with low biological risk.",
