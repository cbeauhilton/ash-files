    "abstract_text": "PTLD is a life threatening complication developing in 1\u20135% of transplant (Tx) recipients. Epstein Barr (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and immunosuppression (IS) were identified as risk factors. Aggressive evolution and therapy related toxicity generate poor prognosis. We retrospectively analyzed data from 18 PTLD patients (pts) diagnosed at our hospital between March 1994- June 2007. All of them were at least one graft recipient and were under IS. RESULTS: Out of 1206 adult Tx recipients, 18 (1,5%) developed PTLD. Ninety-four percent were men, mean age 42,9 years (range: 18\u201372). Our study comprises 10 heart, 2 kidney, 2 lung, 1 heart-lung, 1 liver and 2 non related allogeneic bone marrow (BM) recipients. IS protocols included Cyclosporin A (16 pts), Azathioprine (8), Mycophenolate mofetil (7), Tacrolimus (4) and antitymocyte globulin (2). Pretx recipients serology for EBV and CMV were positive in 87 and 94% respectively. Sixty-six percent (12/18) disclosed late onset PTLD (median 49 months), all of them were solid organ (SO) recipients. BM recipients developed the disease within the first 6 months after Tx. Fifty percent presented extranodal involvement, 3/18 with BM infiltration and 3/18 showed lymphoma in the graft. Histologycal findings: 15/18 B cell lymphoma (8/15 large cell lymphoma), 1 peripheral T cell lymphoma, 1 early lesion infectious mononucleosis-like PTLD, 1 polymorphic hyperplasia PTLD. Immunophenotype: 89% were CD20+. Fifty percent of the group achieved response, 7/9 with complete response(CR). Three/9 pts obtained CR with reduction of IS alone.Treatment included Rituximab (63% pts), CHOP (56%) and radiotherapy (25%). Eleven/18 pts died, 4 due to disease progression, 6 by sepsis and 1 because of underlying hematological disease relapse. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, PTLD was an uncommon complication. The late onset of the disease was the most frequent form of presentation among SO recipients. B cell lymphoma was the main diagnosis (83%). Fifty percent (9/18) achieved response and 78% of them showed CR. Disease progression and sepsis were the most important causes of death.",
