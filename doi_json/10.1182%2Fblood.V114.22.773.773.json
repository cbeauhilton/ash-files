    "abstract_text": "Abstract 773 Thrombin activates platelets by binding and cleaving protease activated receptors 1 and 4 (PAR1 and PAR4). PAR1 and PAR4 communicate with each other to lower the concentration of thrombin required for PAR4 activation (Nieman Biochemistry, 2008). In addition, PAR1 and PAR4 form homo and heterodimers. However, where these receptors interact has not been defined and it is not known if dimerization influences receptor activation, downstream signaling, or both. Since PAR4 activation is important on human and mouse platelets, we sought to characterize the interaction site between PAR4 homodimers. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), we mapped the PAR4 homodimer interface. The PAR4 homodimers show a specific interaction as indicated by a hyperbolic BRET signal in response to increasing PAR4-GFP expression with a fixed concentration of PAR4-Rluc. The threshold maximum BRET signal was disrupted in a concentration-dependent manner by unlabeled PAR4. In contrast, the unrelated G-protein coupled receptor, rhodopsin, was unable to disrupt the BRET signal indicating that the disruption of the PAR4 homodimer is a specific interaction. We have mapped the region required for PAR4 homodimer formation using chimeras between rhodopsin and PAR4. PAR4 does not interact with rhodopsin in BRET assays. Using a library of rho-PAR4 chimeras that have the junction at the beginning of transmembrane (TM) 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7, we determined where dimer formation is restored. When the junction is placed at the beginning of TM4 or TM5, the chimera does not interact with PAR4-WT. In contrast, when the junction is moved to the end of TM2, the BRET signal is restored. These results indicate that the region on PAR4 required for homodimer formation encompasses a 63 amino acid region that includes the first extracellular loop, TM3 and the second intracellular loop. These studies establish techniques that may be used to define the interactions between other GPCRs found on the platelet surface. These receptor-receptor interactions may be another level of regulation of agonist activity and platelet function in vivo and may provide novel targets for anti-platelet therapies.
