    "abstract_text": "Background: Autonomic nerve function can be affected by various factors such as patient activity of daily living, disease status, treatment history and/or comorbidity. Indeed, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, as indexed by heart rate variability (HRV), has shown prognostic value for various disease outcomes, but its influence on outcomes following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is unclear. We therefore conducted a prospective observational study to determine the impact of autonomic nervous system dysfunction on outcomes following allo-HCT. Methods: From July 2011 to July 2013, we prospectively registered patients who had received allo-HCT in our institute. We also applied well-established examination of HRV as a surrogate maker of the autonomic nervous system. HRV data were collected from 24-hour ambulatory ECG recordings within 28 days of the starting day of the conditioning regimen for allo-HCT. Obtained data were analyzed with RR data analysis software (MemCalc/CHIRAM version 3, GMS Co., LTD., Tokyo, Japan). The following parameters were employed as markers of HRV: standard deviation of NN interval (SDNN) and the squares of the differences between adjacent normal-to-normal RR intervals (r-MSSD) in time domain analysis, and low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) power in frequency domain analysis. \u0394 Akaike's information criterion (\u0394 AIC) was used to compare the HRV components-added model to the basic model by the Pre-transplantation Assessment of Mortality (PAM) score, HCT-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI), or disease risk index (DRI) in a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: We registered 112 consecutive allo-HCTs (103 patients) who agreed to participate in this study. The median age of the patients was 45.5 years (range: 18-66) and the median follow-up period for survivors (76 patients) was 961 days (range: 159-1654). Diagnoses included acute myeloid leukemia (n=55, 49%), acute lymphoid leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma (n=13, 12%), mixed phenotype acute leukemia (n=3, 3%), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=15, 13%), adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (n=7, 6%), aggressive lymphomas (n=6, 5%), indolent lymphoma/chronic lymphoid leukemia (n=3, 3%), chronic myeloid leukemia/other myeloproliferative neoplasms (n=5, 4%), aplastic anemia (n=2, 2%), and others (n=3, 3%). Stem cell sources consisted of HLA-matched related donors for 18 transplants (16%), mismatched related donors for 24 transplants (22%), matched unrelated donors for 32 transplants (29%), mismatched unrelated donors for 8 transplants (7%), and cord blood for 30 transplants (27%). Myeloablative conditioning was employed for 84 transplants (75%). Median value of LF, HF, SDNN, and r-MSSD was 409 msec 2 (range: 27-1279), 103 msec 2 (range: 5-1309), 122 msec (range: 48-231), and 20 msec (range: 4-95), respectively.From univariate analysis, the reduction of LF, HF, SDNN, or r-MSSD was significantly associated with decreased probability of OS (hazard ratio (HR): 0.7 for LF per 100 msec 2 (p<0001), 0.5 for HF per 100 msec 2 (p=0.001), 0.2 for SDNN per 100 msec (p=0.004), and 0.6 for r-MSSD per 10 msec(p=0.01), respectively). Of these four HRV components, the LF-added model for PAM, HCT-CI, and DRI had the highest values of \u0394 AIC (16.5, 22.2 and 11.4, respectively). From the analysis with stratification into four LF groups divided equally by the number of transplants (n=28), two-year OS was 92.9, 84.5, 59.7, and 33.2%, respectively ( p <0.0001). LF solely represented a better discriminating variable for the prediction of survival. Additionally, from bivariate analysis for OS on each LF-added model to PAM, HCT-CI, or DRI, decreased LF was found to be an independent predictor for lower OS (adjusted HR for LF per 100 msec 2 : 0.7 (p=0.0003), 0.7 (p<0.0001), or 0.7 (p=0.001), respectively). Conclusions: Pre-transplant autonomic nervous system dysfunction is a powerful predictor of survival likely because it reflects the comprehensive physiological or pathological status of the patient. Of note, LF was a powerful predictor for survival and statistically independent from well-known prognostic indexes or scoring systems such as PAM, HCT-CI, and DRI.
