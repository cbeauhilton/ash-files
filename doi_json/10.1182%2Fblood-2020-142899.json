    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukaemia is a disease of the haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells distinguished by an impairment of proliferation, propagation and differentiation of the haematopoietic lineage[1]. AML is a heterogenous disease, where patient stratification and personalised therapeutic strategies are of importance[2]. The transmembrane protein CD37 has been associated with regulation of cell to cell interaction and proliferation in both B and T cells. Mice knockout studies have suggested that CD37 is not crucial for B cell development, however, it is highly expressed in malignant and suboptimal conditions and thus represent a good target for B-cell malignancies[3]. Pereira et al. reported that their anti-CD37 antibody-drug conjugate was a potential therapeutic in AML[4]. Their study revealed anti-leukemic effect in primary AML material and cell lines both in vivo and in vitro . An investigation of CD37 expression in AML patients is needed to understand the relevance of CD37 immunotherapy. To investigate the relevance of targeted therapy of CD37 the chimeric mAb NNV003 anti-CD37 antibody was evaluated in AML samples. Single-cell time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF), an established tool to analyse the immune signalling in bone marrow and peripheral blood, was used to investigate CD37 expression in 59 AML patient samples. A panel was designed to categorise hierarchical landscape of AML and the leukemic stem cell population (LSCs). CyTOF identified CD37 expression exclusively in the B-cell population of our 59 patients, whereas the AML blast population was negative for CD37 expression. Flow cytometry, however; identified 5/59 patients with CD37 expression in the leukemic blast population. Although previous studies show that an anti-CD37 drug conjugate showed anti-leukemic effect in vivo and in vitro , our results do not support that it is a promising therapeutic biomarker. We have uncovered that malignant expression of CD37 is not a feature of the AML patients investigated. We do not consider CD37 to be a promising and good target for precision therapy of AML.
