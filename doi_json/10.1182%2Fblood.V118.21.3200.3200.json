    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3200 Background: Phosphatidylinositol-phosphate-kinase type II alpha (PIP4KII\u03b1) belongs to a family of lipid kinases responsible for the production of a variety of lipid second messengers, such as PI4,5P 2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate), and appears to be implicated in the regulation of gene expression, pre-mRNA processing and mRNA export. In a previous study, two transcripts, PIP4KII\u03b1 and \u03b2-globin, were found to be overexpressed in reticulocytes from two siblings with Hb H disease, suggesting a possible relationship between this enzyme and the production of globins, particularly \u03b2-globin. Recently, we established a gene expression pattern for PIP4KII\u03b1 in healthy individuals during in vitro erythropoiesis and observed a gradual increase in the expression of this gene during erythroid differentiation similar to that observed for globin genes, reinforcing the hypothesis of a relationship between PIP4KII\u03b1 and globin expression. Aim: To investigate the effects of PIP4KII\u03b1 gene silencing on the expression of \u03b1- and \u03b3-globin genes in human K562 cells. Methods: Two different human K562 cells cultures were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding PIP4KII\u03b1-specific shRNA or non-relevant control shRNA. After transduction the positive cells were selected by adding puromycin to the culture and collected 2, 6, 8 and 10 days later to analyze gene and protein expression. PIP4KII\u03b1 and \u03b1- and \u03b3-globin gene expression was assessed by qRT-PCR and quantified using the equation RQ=2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct . Western blot analysis was performed to determine PIP4KII\u03b1 protein expression. \u03b2-actin and GAPDH were used as endogenous controls in the qRT-PCR, and \u03b2-actin in the Western blot. Results: Analysis of the results showed that there was a statistically significant reduction in PIP4KII\u03b1 mRNA levels in knockdown cells (79%) (0.208 \u00b1 0.048; p<0.0001) compared with the control culture. Western blot analysis corroborated these findings. PIP4KII\u03b1 silencing resulted in an 18% (0.927 \u00b1 0.244; p=0.09) and 44% (0.625 \u00b1 0.124; p=0.03) reduction in the expression of \u03b1- and \u03b3-globin genes, respectively, compared with the control. Conclusion: Although the reduction in \u03b1-globin gene expression did not achieve statistical significance, our results revealed alterations in \u03b1- and \u03b3-globin gene expression in PIP4KII\u03b1 knockdown cells, suggesting a parallelism between the expression of PIP4KII\u03b1 and globin genes and reinforcing the hypothesis that the former may be involved in regulation of the latter.
