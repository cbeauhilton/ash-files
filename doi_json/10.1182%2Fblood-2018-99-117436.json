    "abstract_text": "Increasing fetal hemoglobin (HbF) provides significant clinical benefit for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and is a critical goal that is being pursued with a variety of pharmacologic strategies. Hydroxyurea (HU) is currently the only FDA-approved drug aimed at raising HbF for SCD patients but is limited in its efficacy. Recent work in our laboratory utilizing a protein kinase-domain focused CRISPR-Cas9 based genetic screen identified heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), an erythroid-specific protein kinase, as a novel HbF regulator (Grevet et al., Science 361:6399, 285-290). Depleting HRI in a human erythroid cell line and primary human erythroid cultures significantly raised HbF levels. Besides HU, several compounds have been recently identified as in vitro HbF inducers, including pomalidomide, a third-generation imide, and UNC0638, an EHMT 1/2 histone methyltransferase inhibitor. While all these approaches induce HbF in vitro, it remains to be seen whether these would achieve sufficient levels of HbF induction in patients when used as single agents. Although the specific mechanisms by which HRI, HU, pomalidomide and UNC0638 regulate HbF remain to be fully resolved, we hypothesized that they might work in distinct pathways, and that by combining them might improve effect size and diminish potential adverse effects on erythroid cell maturation and viability. We utilized a three-stage in vitro culture system that recapitulates normal erythropoiesis by terminal differentiation of adult CD34+ hematopoietic cells. Primary human CD34+ cells were treated with select pharmacologic inducers of HbF, including hydroxyurea, pomalidomide, or UNC0638, in combination with shRNA lentiviral knockdown of HRI. HbF levels were assessed by RT-qPCR, Western blot, flow cytometry, and cation-exchange HPLC. We find that knockdown of HRI leads to significant HbF induction as expected. We further observed an inverse correlation between remaining HRI levels and HbF induction with maximal effect size requiring 85%-90% HRI depletion. HU displayed comparatively little activity and failed to increase the effects of HRI knockdown. However, treatment with pharmacologic levels of pomalidomide or UNC0638 combined with HRI depletion each showed greater than additive effects in HbF with levels reaching 25-30% HbF for UNC0638-treated and 30-40% HbF for pomalidomide-treated combinations, suggesting underlying cooperativity of HbF induction. RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses suggest that the diminished expression of the HbF repressor BCL11A accounts in large part for HbF induction in HRI knockdown samples, particularly when combined with pomalidomide treatment in which Bcl11A depletion was greater than 90%, while other HbF repressors such as LRF were unchanged. To determine whether HbF induction results in reduced sickle cell formation, we performed combination HRI depletion and HbF pharmacologic induction in primary CD34+ cells derived from sickle cell patients. HRI depletion in primary SCD cells showed a marked increase in HbF from baseline levels; in addition, significant cooperativity with pomalidomide and UNC0638 was observed, achieving 45-50% HbF for UNC0638-treated and 50-60% HbF for pomalidomide-treated drug combinations with no apparent detrimental effects on erythroid differentiation or maturation. Importantly, combination of HRI knockdown and HbF pharmacologic treatments markedly reduced in vitro sickling as measured by low-oxygen sickling assays, suggesting significant amelioration of the sickle cell phenotype in vitro. Overall, we find that the combination of HbF pharmacologic induction and shRNA-mediated HRI inhibition results in significant cooperative upregulation of HbF levels in both normal and sickle cell-derived primary human cells without impairing red cell maturation. We are currently exploring additional potential synergies with HbF regulators to determine the optimal modalities to maximize HbF induction. While no effective and specific HRI inhibitors are currently available, our work suggests that future small molecule inhibition of HRI may be combined with other pharmacotherapies to achieve significant, clinically meaningful HbF induction for the treatment of SCD and other hemoglobinopathies.
