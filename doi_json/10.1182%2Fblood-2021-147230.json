    "abstract_text": "Background In the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) is essential for early intensification and maintenance therapy. Recently, it has been reported that a gene polymorphism of nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X-type motif 15 (NUDT15) rs116855232 is associated with the 6-MP induced severe myelotoxicity. Since the NUDT15 rs116855232 polymorphism is relatively common in East Asian and Hispanic populations, it is important to evaluate the association between the polymorphism and 6-MP for determining the dose of effective therapy and avoiding the side effect in Japan. However, there are few reports on the association between NUDT15 polymorphisms and the therapeutic efficacy or side effects of 6-MP in the early intensification; most previous reports focused on the maintenance therapy so far. The purpose of this study is to clarify the association between NUDT15 polymorphism and the actual treatment status with 6-MP or its side effects, therefore to contribute to the effective and safe treatment of childhood ALL in Japan. Methods Twenty-four patients with ALL who received early intensification therapy according to the JPLSG ALL-B12 or JPLSG ALL-T11 protocol at the Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Hospital, between April 2013 and May 2021 were included in the study. We retrospectively collected the clinical and laboratory data from the clinical records. And we also performed the sequence analysis of the exon 1 and 3 in NUDT15 gene Results Genetic analysis of NUDT15 showed no nucleotide changes other than rs116855232. Twenty patients were CC (wild-type), 4 patients were CT (heterozygous-variant), and 0 patients were TT (homozygous-variant). Of the 4 patients with heterozygous-variant, one patient received a reduced dose of 6-MP because of early onset myelotoxicity during early intensification therapy. In this patient, the total dose of 6-MP was 70% of the standard dose. All the 24 patients showed myelotoxicity and hepatotoxicity during early intensification therapy. Correlations between NUDT15 haplotype and side effects as myelotoxicity and hepatotoxicity were not significant. Discussion In the heterozygous-variant of NUDT15 rs116855232, the incidence and degree of myelotoxicity and hepatotoxicity during early intensification therapy did not differ from the wild-type. The international consortium (Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium Guideline, 2018) recommends that the dose of 6-MP should be reduced to 10mg/m2/day in patients with homozygous variant of NUDT15, however, the reduction of the starting dose of 6-MP in those with heterozygous variant is not recommended. Of note, these recommendations were made based on the data in the maintenance therapy. Our study suggests that the reduction of the starting dose may not be necessary in children with heterozygous variant. The NUDT15 rs116855232 polymorphism is common in Japan, with 10% of heterozygotes and 1.1% of homozygotes. In future study, a larger study on the association between NUDT15 polymorphism and treatment outcome including side effects in the early intensification is needed in East Asia to confirm the results of our study.
