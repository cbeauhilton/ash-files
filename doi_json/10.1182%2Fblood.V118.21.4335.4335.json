    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4335 Background: Supratherapeutic INRs are common with warfarin therapy, and increase serious bleeding risk. Octaplex is a prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) that is recommended for urgent warfarin reversal. However, disagreement exists regarding proper dosing strategies (fixed versus weight-based). Objectives: We sought to measure the in vitro effect of Octaplex on INR and factor levels, and to characterize this relationship. Methods: Plasma samples from eligible patients on warfarin with stable INRs for \u22654 weeks were collected. Plasma volumes were calculated to approximate 1000, 2000 and 3000IU doses of Octaplex and these were added to the samples. INR and factor levels were measured pre- and post-Octaplex. Results: Twenty-three of the 30 subjects enrolled had complete data for analysis. INRs corrected 0.50IU for II, VII and X (0.96\u20131.52, 0.51\u20131.45 and 0.81\u20131.38, respectively). Factor IX did not uniformly correct >0.50IU (0.31\u20131.31). Conclusion: We confirmed in vitro that 1000IU of Octaplex was able to correct INR to 0.50IU until 2000IU, and >1.00IU not until 3000IU. Our study suggests that INR correction alone may not appropriately reflect sufficient factor activity, and lends support for weight-based PCC dosing.
