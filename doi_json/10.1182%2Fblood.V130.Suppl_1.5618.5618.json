    "abstract_text": "Background: Bendamustine (B), often administered in combination with rituximab (BR), and ibrutinib monotherapy are approved front-line therapies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). BR is standardly administered on days 1-2 of every 28-day cycle, for up to 6 cycles. Ibrutinib is an oral inhibitor of BTK and is administered continuously until intolerance or progression. Interruption in ibrutinib treatment of \u2265 8 consecutive days has been related to inferior outcomes in CLL (Barr PM, et al. Blood 2017;129:2612-2615). The objective of this study was to examine hospitalizations of CLL patients receiving front-line treatment with bendamustine or ibrutinib in a real-world setting, Methods: CLL patients with no prior treatment between November 2013 and December 2015 who had at least one claim for ibrutinib or bendamustine were identified from MarketScan\u00ae Commercial Claims and Medicare Supplemental databases. The index date was the first prescription for ibrutinib or bendamustine. Inclusion criteria were \u2265 18 years of age with continuous enrollment for a minimum of 6 months before and at least 30 days after the index date. Patients had variable follow-up until either the end of continuous enrollment or the end of the study period. Ibrutinib patients were stratified by number of consecutive gap days (eg, 0, 1-7, 8+). Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the rate of all-cause and CLL-specific inpatient admissions. The average length of stay for the first hospitalization occurring during the line of therapy was also modeled. Results: This study included 1192 CLL patients receiving ibrutinib (mean 68 years of age; 66% male) or bendamustine (mean 66 years of age; 67% male) treatment; 622 patients (52.2%) had ibrutinib and 570 (47.8%) had bendamustine as front-line treatment (Table). Over 92% of the bendamustine patients received BR. Among patients with two or more prescriptions for ibrutinib (n = 560), about 48% had treatment gaps of 8 days or longer based on days' supply and fill dates on the prescription claim. The rate of hospital admissions was similar between the two groups (all cause: ibrutinib 0.57 per person years, bendamustine 0.58 per person years, P = .89; CLL related: 0.51 both groups, P = .98). Among hospitalized patients, all-cause (4.35 days longer) and CLL-related inpatient admissions (4.36 days longer) were significantly longer for ibrutinib compared with bendamustine patients ( P < .0001). This effect was most pronounced in hospitalized ibrutinib patients with 8 or more gap days (all cause: 6.02 days longer, P < .0001; CLL related: 6.09 days longer, P < .0001) and to a lesser extent in the ibrutinib patients with 0-7 gap days (all cause: 2.1 days longer, P < .05; CLL related: 1.96 days longer, P = .08) compared with bendamustine patients. The analysis of ibrutinib compared with the subset of the patients with BR yielded similar results Conclusions: Although there was no statistical difference in hospital admissions among patients receiving ibrutinib or bendamustine, ibrutinib-treated patients had significantly longer hospital stays compared with bendamustine-treated patients. In addition, nearly 50% of ibrutinib patients had gaps in treatment of 8 or more days. Nonadherence has previously been shown to be associated with clinical outcomes. More studies are needed to evaluate the consequences of treatment adherence and clinical outcomes.
