[1, 2] Hypothesis : We hypothesized that (a) patient-derived AML-specific PB auto CTLs could be generated with immune-stimulatory culture condition (b) Resistant AML samples would possess gene expression profiles similar to MDSCs (myeloid-derived suppressor cells) (c) Frequency of T regs (CD4 + CD25 bright FoxP3 + ) and T-cell co-signaling molecules gene expression will be different between effective and ineffective CTLs. Methods: AML & auto T-cells were purified from cryopreserved PBMC of AML patients admitted with acute blast crisis (n=8). AML blasts were sustained in StemSpan\u2122 Serum-Free media [STEMCELL Technologies] with MSC support + cytokine cocktail (IL-3, SCF, FLT3L, GMCSF, IL-4). T-cells were expanded in culture for 2 weeks as reported [1, 2] and subsequently primed with \u03b3-irradiated auto AML weekly X 3 with IL15 + CD28ab [BD Biosciences]. At the end of week 3 (EOW3), cytotoxicity was assessed against AML and irrelevant targets - IM9 (lymphoid) and U937 (myeloid) cell lines, loaded with BATDA at an E:T ratio of 40:1, 20:1, 10:1 and 5:1 using DELFIA\u00ae EuTDA assay.[2] IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay against same targets was also done.[2] RT-qPCR analysis was performed on AML & T-cells before and after priming, using Power SYBR\u00ae Green master mix ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and StepOne Plus system [Life Technologies]. Two-tailed student t-test compared experimental groups. Results \u00b7 T-cells expanded in all samples (n=8) with a median expansion of 155-fold (range 11-489), at EOW3. \u00b7 ELISPOT assay was positive in 4/8 samples. [ Fig 1 ] \u00b7 CTL assay was difficult to standardize for primary AML blasts due to high degree of spontaneous apoptosis (>30% spontaneous release [SR]). \u00b7 2/8 samples were deemed evaluable (SR<30%). \u00b7 Both samples showed AML-specific lysis. [ Fig 2 ] \u00b7 Overall, AML-specific autologous CTL could be generated from 5 of 8 samples based on ELISPOT & CTL assays, regardless of original FAB immunophenotype, not shown. \u00b7 T regs proportion declined significantly in effective CTLs post-priming as compared to pre-priming (56% to 24%, p-value 0.046, n=4). [ Fig 3 ] \u00b7 T-cell gene expression profiling showed significant differences in effective vs ineffective CTLs. [ Table 1 ] \u00b7 Resistant AML (n=3) had up-regulated downstream markers associated with MDSC generation compared to \u201cnon-resistant\u201d AML (n=5). [ Table 2 ] Conclusions (a) AML-specific auto CTLs can be generated (b) T regs decreased with priming in effective CTLs (c) differential T-cell gene expression profile exists between effective and ineffective CTLs (d) AML gene expression suggests MDSC-like profile in resistant samples.
