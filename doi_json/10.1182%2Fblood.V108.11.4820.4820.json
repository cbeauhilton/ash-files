    "abstract_text": "OBJECTIVES: Imatinib (IM) has demonstrated durable clinical efficacy in the majority of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Optimal response may be influenced by multiple innate and external factors, some of which may be controlled by monitoring plasma concentrations of the drug. This abstract reports 6 cases where analyzing plasma IM trough concentrations (Cmin) in patients treated with three commonly used IM doses (400, 600, and 800 mg daily) influenced clinical decision making. METHODS: IM trough blood samples were collected at a time before that day\u2019s IM dosing. Plasma concentrations of IM were determined by a validated LC/MS/MS method. RESULTS: In large population studies of CML patients enrolled in Phase I, II, and III clinical trials, the mean Cmin levels of IM at 400 mg qd, 600 mg qd, and 400 mg bid doses were: 981 (\u00b1543, 55%, n=394), 1572 (\u00b11032, 66%, n=14), and 3479 (\u00b11264, 36%, n=14) ng/mL, respectively. Large inter-patient variability was shown at all three doses. Of the 6 cases detailed in the table below, 4 (ID 1, 3, 4, and 5) had dose reduction due to tolerability concerns with subsequent improvement of symptoms following dose adjustment. One patient (ID 2) had a dose increase because of a poor qRT-PCR response. Another (ID 6) had a dose increase due to low plasma IM exposure resulting from drug-drug interaction with phenytoin, a known inducer of CYP3A4 (the major metabolizing isozyme for IM). After dose adjustment, all six patients showed good clinical response to IM treatment. The new mean Cmin value in these patients was 2000 (\u00b1471) ng/mL, representing a 24% coefficient of variability. CONCLUSIONS: Although the data is limited, IM drug monitoring proved useful in managing tolerability, lack of efficacy, adherence or potential drug interactions that modulate imatinib drug concentrations. More prospective studies are needed to demonstrate the value of IM drug monitoring in routine clinical practice.  Patient ID . Age, Sex . CML Stage . IM Daily Dose . 1st Cmin (ng/mL) .
