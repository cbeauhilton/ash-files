    "abstract_text": "Congenital dysfibrinogenemia is a rare disease characterized by inherited abnormality in the fibrinogen molecule, resulting in functional defects. Two patients, both with history of thrombotic events, had abnormal coagulation test results. DNA sequencing showed the heterozygous \u03b3 Y363N mutation and the heterozygous A\u03b1 N106D mutation, respectively. Fibrin polymerization, after addition of either thrombin or reptilase, showed remarkably delayed polymerization in both cases. Fibrinolysis experiments showed slower tPA initiated lysis of clots. Both mutations had a significant effect on platelet aggregation. Aggregation initiated by ADP and TRAP were significantly different. After initiation with ADP (weak activator), the aggregation of platelets from a healthy donor in the presence of fibrinogen with A\u03b1 N106D mutation was markedly decreased. The aggregation in the presence of abnormal fibrinogen \u03b3 Y363N was significantly decreased at the level of significance P =0.05. Average aggregation response after the addition of ADP was (42 \u00b1 7) % for abnormal fibrinogen \u03b3 Y363N, (20 \u00b1 4) % for abnormal fibrinogen A\u03b1 N106D, and (55 \u00b1 8) % for normal fibrinogen, respectively. After initiation with TRAP (strong activator), the aggregation of platelets from a healthy donor in the presence of both fibrinogens was significantly decreased at the level of significance P =0.05. Average aggregation response after the addition of TRAP was (60 \u00b1 4) % for abnormal fibrinogen \u03b3 Y363N, (63 \u00b1 11) % for abnormal fibrinogen A\u03b1 N106D, and (89 \u00b1 10) % for normal fibrinogen, respectively. SEM revealed abnormal clot morphology, with a large number of free ends and narrower fibers. In conclusion, we identified novel mutations in the fibrinogen polymerization pocket \"a\" ( \u03b3 Y363N) and in the fibrinogen coiled-coil region (A\u03b1 N106D) causing congenital dysfibrinogenemia associated with thromboses.
