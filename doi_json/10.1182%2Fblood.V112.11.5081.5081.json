    "abstract_text": "Background : Epigenetic therapy with hypomethylating agents has recently been approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in Argentina. Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) is a hybrid disorder characterized by myeloid proliferation and erythroid-megakaryocytic dysplasia. Subgroup analyses ( Kantarjian H, Cancer  2006 ; 106 : 1794 ; Steensma DP, ASCO  2008 :Abstr 7032 ) and open-label studies ( Aribi A, Cancer  2007 ; 109 : 713 ; Wijermans PW, Leuk Res  2008 ; 32 : 587 ) have reported that decitabine (DACOGEN, Janssen Cilag Farmaceutica S.A. and Eisai Inc.) is effective in the management of CMML. Study objective : To compare the clinical and hematological improvement with decitabine among patients with CMML to those with other MDS subtypes. Methods : We enrolled patients with MDS who received decitabine between July 2007 and June 2008 at 17 centers in our country. Inclusion criteria were \u226518 years of age, de novo or secondary MDS and an International Prognosis Scoring System (IPSS) score \u22650.5. Exclusion criteria were diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or other progressive malignant disease. Patients with prior therapy for MDS/CMML were not excluded. Patients were categorized as having CMML or another sub-type of MDS according to FAB/WHO criteria. All pts received decitabine 20 mg/m 2 IV over 1 hour once daily for 5 consecutive days repeating every 4 weeks. Overall improvement rate (complete response + marrow complete response + partial response + hematologic improvement) was compared between cohorts with chi-square and Fisher\u2019s tests. Results : There were 11 patients with CMML and 27 patients with other subtypes of MDS. Demographic characteristics are summarized in the table. All CMML patients were BCR/ABL negative. Three patients had CMML type II (WHO classification, Blasts \u226510% in marrow and/or \u22655% in peripheral blood) and 8 had CMML type I. Four patients with CMML had proliferative features with WBC >13000/mm 3 and splenomegaly at the time of diagnosis. The overall response was 73% in patients with CMML and 33% in patients with other MDS sub-types (p=0.003). Median time to first response in CMML pts was 2 cycles. Tolerability was acceptable in both groups with no significant differences. Conclusion : Although our study group is small, decitabine demonstrated marked activity in CMML. Additional study of decitabine therapy in CMML is warranted.  Variable . CMML (N=11) .
