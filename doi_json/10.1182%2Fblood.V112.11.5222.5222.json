    "abstract_text": "Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES) or chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) comprise a spectrum of indolent to aggressive diseases characterized by persistent hypereosinophilia. Hypereosinophilia can result from the presence of a defect in the hematopoietic stem cell giving rise to eosinophilia, it can present in many myeloproliferative disorders or alternatively it may be a reactive form, secondary to many clinical conditions. The fusion gene FIP1L1-PDGFR alpha was identified in a subset of patients presenting with HES/CEL. In spite of this, the majority of HES/CEL patients do not present detectable molecular lesions and for many of them the diagnosis is based on exclusion criteria and sometimes it remains doubt. CD34-positive progenitor cells from bone marrow (BM) express BAALC and WT1. Overexpression of BAALC and WT1 were seen in patients with AML and ALL. In a subset of AML it marked poor prognosis, suggesting a role for BAALC or WT1 overexpression in acute leukemia. To explored the possibility to distinguish between HES/CEL and reactive hypereosinophilia based on the measurement of BAALC and WT1 transcript amount. Twenty-two patients with hypereosinophilia were characterized at the molecular level and analyzed for BAALC and WT1 expression. The transcription of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion gene was detected by nested RT-PCR. The relative transcript amount of BAALC and WT1 were determined by real time PCR analyses. The FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion gene expressed has been identified in bone marrow mononuclear cells of 4 cases. The relative expression level of BAALC and WT1 in these 4 cases with positive FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion gene expression were 2.27(0.27\u20136.8) and 0.39(0.002\u20130.90), respectively. Whereas the relative amount of transcripts of BAALC and WT1 in 18 patients with negative FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion gene were 0.069(0.015\u20130.11) and 0.054(0\u20130.34) respectively. The relative amount of transcripts of BAALC and WT1 in patients with HES/CEL were 32 times and 7 times than that in those with negative FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion gene, respectively. These results clearly demonstrates that BAALC and WT1 quantitative assessment allows to discriminate between HES/CEL and reactive eosinophilia and represents a useful tool for disease monitoring especially in the patients lacking a marker of clonality.",
