    "abstract_text": "Background Experimental data are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of the PDGF receptor (PDGFR) is characteristic of scleroderma (SSc) fibroblasts and may contribute to their activation. We have recently demonstrated that fibroblasts from SSc patients contain high Ha Ras and ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) levels and constitutive activation of ERK1/2 (Svegliati et al: JBC in press). Furthermore, SSc patients have circulating auto-antibodies against the PDGFR which induce type I collagen gene expression in normal human fibroblasts through the Ha Ras -ERK1/2- ROS pathway (Svegliati et al: Submitted). These findings suggest that anti PDGFR auto-antibodies play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of scleroderma. Clinical chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) can show manifestations that are very similar to those of SSc. Although it is conceivable that the two diseases can share a similar pathophysiological mechanism there are no data supporting this assumption. In view of these considerations we tested the hypothesis that patients with cGVHD have serum auto-antibodies that stimulate PDGFR and activate collagen gene expression in fibroblasts. Methods Serum from 7 patients with extensive cGVHD showing scleroderma-like features either in the skin or in the lung was analyzed for the presence of stimulatory autoantibodies to PDGFR. Patients receiving allogeneic transplantation, but without any signs of cGVHD were used as controls. The median F-U after transplant was 23 months (range 16\u201336) in patients with cGVH and 42 (range 9\u201351) in the control group. The assay was carried by incubating purified IgG of the patients with mouse embryo fibroblasts carrying inactive copies of PDGFR \u03b1 or \u03b2 chains (PDGFR \u2212/\u2212) or the same cells expressing PDGFR \u03b1 or \u03b2, respectively. Production of reactive oxygen species was assayed in the presence or absence of specific PDGFR inhibitors. The antibodies were characterized by immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting and absorption experiments in primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Result Stimulatory antibodies to the PDGFR were selectively found in all patients with cGVHD and fibrotic lesions. The antibodies specifically recognized PDGFR, induced tyrosine phosphorylation and ROS accumulation. Their activity was completely and selectively abolished by pre-incubation with cells expressing PDGFR \u03b1 or \u03b2 chains or by PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Anti-PDGFR antibodies induced selectively Ha- Ras -ERK1/2 and ROS cascade and stimulated the expression of type I collagen gene and myofibroblast phenotype conversion in normal human primary fibroblasts. Antibodies were absent in all controls. Conclusions Stimulatory auto-antibodies against PDGFR represent a specific hallmark of patients with cGVHD. Their biological activity on fibroblasts strongly argues for a causal role in the pathogenesis of the disease."
