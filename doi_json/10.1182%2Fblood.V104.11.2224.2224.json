    "abstract_text": "CMV reactivation after allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains problematic and is increasing in frequency with the use of reduced intensity conditioning regimens. A functional immune response is critical to control viral replication and hence disease. In this study, 19 allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients at risk for CMV reactivation were followed for a median of 185 days. Six patients received myeloablative conditioning and thirteen patients received reduced intensity conditioning therapy. Functional CMV specific immune responses were monitored by flow cytometry, measuring CD4 and CD8 specific intracellular interferon gamma production in response to stimulation with peptide pools of 15 mer overlapping peptides spanning the entire length of the immunodominant PP65 and IE1 proteins. In addition the CD4 response to whole CMV antigen, which is capable of presenting multiple viral antigens, was also determined. 53% of patients experienced a CMV reactivation with a median time to 1 st reactivation of 53.5 days (range 20\u2013134). In comparison with the CMV reactivation group, the mean day 50 CD4 whole CMV antigen response was approximately 2 logs lower in the reactivated group (0.065X10 6 /L) than the non-reactivated group (3.620X10 6 /L) suggesting that CMV specific CD4 function is an important predictor of patients at risk of CMV reactivation. The incidence of CMV reactivation in patients receiving Campath-1H was 71% (10 out of 14 patients) while none of the 5 patients in the non-Campath-1H group reactivated. The use of Campath-1H as part of the conditioning regimen was associated with a significantly lower day 50 CD4 whole CMV antigen response (0.06X10 6 /L) vs (4.53X10 6 /L) for the non-Campath-1H group, suggesting a mechanism for the observed increased frequency of CMV reactivation with the use of this agent. The relative contribution of the CD4 and CD8 responses to IE1 and PP65 has also been determined in this patient group. In summary, the absolute functional helper T cell response to CMV was predictive of viral reactivation following transplant.",
