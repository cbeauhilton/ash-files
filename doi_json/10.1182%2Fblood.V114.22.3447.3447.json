    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3447 Poster Board III-335 B-CLL is characterized by the accumulation of mature B lymphocytes incapable of undergoing apoptosis. Although several mechanisms have been implicated in the apoptotic defects in B-CLL cells, the signal transduction pathways underlying these defects remain unresolved. Lyn kinase is known to be a negative regulator of apoptosis, and is linked to chemo-resistance. Our preliminary study indicated that Lyn activity was 4- to 7-fold higher in primary B cells from six randomly-selected B-CLL patients than in normal B cells from healthy donors. Treatment of the B-CLL cells for 4 h with 10 \u03bcM concentration of a Lyn-specific inhibitor peptide targeting a unique interaction site within Lyn (Cancer Res. 2004;64:1058) resulted in 40 to 50% inhibition of Lyn kinase activity compared to negligible inhibition with control peptide. Further, treatment of the B-CLL cells for 16 to 20 h with the Lyn inhibitor peptide at 5 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM concentrations, decreased the cell viability by \u223c25% and \u223c50%, respectively, compared with no peptide or the control peptide. Fludarabine is one of the key chemotherapeutic agents for B-CLL and is known to induce cell death by apoptosis. The combined treatment with Lyn inhibitor peptide (5 \u03bcM) and fludarabine (2 \u03bcg/ml), decreased cell viability by \u223c50% compared to \u223c25% decrease with fludarabine or Lyn inhibitor peptide alone. In addition, the combined treatment showed \u223c75% increase in caspase-3/7 activity compared to \u223c25% increase with the Lyn inhibitor peptide or fludarabine alone. Because, overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins is correlated with apoptotic resistance of B-CLL cells, we examined the effect of Lyn inhibitor peptide on the changes in the expression of antiapoptotic genes, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). Treatment of B-CLL cells with 10 \u03bcM Lyn inhibitor peptide for 16 to 20 h resulted in more than 50% decreases in the expression of all the three antiapoptotic genes. Further, the Lyn inhibitor peptide markedly inhibited NF-\u03baB activation (\u223c60%) and VEGF production (\u223c80%), both strongly implicated in the apoptotic resistance of B-CLL cells. Collectively, our results suggest that targeting Lyn kinase pathway with a clinically relevant Lyn kinase inhibitor may have a therapeutic potential for B-CLL.
