    "abstract_text": "Increased expression of fetal globin ( HBG ) has been shown to reduce clinical severity of beta-globin disorders and increase survival in sickle cell disease (SCD), through improved globin chain balance in beta thalassemia and reduced HbS polymerization. Pharmacologic approaches are considered most feasible for a majority of patients. Both proportions of F-cells and quantity of hemoglobin F (HbF)/cell are important for therapeutic effects. PB-04 was identified in a high-throughput screen of US and EU-approved drugs to activate HBG gene transcription, without cytotoxicity, to induce fetal globin expression (gamma globin mRNA, F-cells, HbF/cell, HbF), and to suppress or displace 4 repressors of the fetal globin gene promoter ( BCL11A,  LSD-1, KLF-1 , and HDAC-3 ) in hemoglobinopathy patients' erythroid progenitors. PB-04 enhanced HbF in progenitors from hydroxyurea (HU)-treated patients with sickle cell disease. In in vivo studies, PB-04 induced fetal globin expression >20-fold with oral dosing in anemic baboons, and by 3.5-fold in mice transgenic for 2 copies of the human \u03b2-globin gene locus. This agent has been approved and in broad use for Parkinson's Disease treatment for 5 decades in Europe and Canada, to enhance the PK of an active Parkinson's agent, solely in a combination formulation. Because of its safety with chronic dosing up to 1300 mg/day, PB-04 is therefore of interest for repurposing in the treatment of thalassemia and SCD. This Ph1b trial (NCT004432623) will evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy (fetal globin expression) with at least 3 escalating dose cohorts in up to 24 beta thalassemia intermedia (BTI) patients and 12 patients with sickle cell disease, > 18 years, both genders, with 12 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks of follow-up. Doses to be explored were selected from safe and active human equivalent doses in preclinical toxicology and efficacy studies in 2 species. Primary inclusion criteria include clinical diagnosis of BTI, including HbE beta thalassemia, with at least one beta globin gene mutation, or diagnosis of HbSS or HbSb thalassemia (after dose selection); total Hb levels 6-10 gm/dL. Exclusion criteria include red blood cell (RBC) transfusion within 2 months prior to administration of study medication, receiving regular transfusions, and hepatic or renal function > 3 x institutional ULN. Primary endpoints include occurrence, severity, and duration of adverse events by CTCAE v5.0 criteria and PK parameters. Secondary endpoints include change from baseline in assays of HbF expression, total Hb, markers of hemolysis . Exploratory endpoints include select polymorphisms associated with basal fetal globin expression and in vitro responses to the study drug. Statistical analysis will assess the rate of adverse events, PK parameters by dose, and changes in F-cells, F-reticulocytes, HbF/cell, HbF (% and total), compared to 2 averaged baseline values using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Changes will be analyzed by mixed effect models during the 12-week dosing and 4-week follow-up period. Currently 3 dose cohorts with BTI are enrolled. This study, if successful, will provide a rational basis for definitive trials of an established safe oral therapeutic, with no overlapping toxicities with other experimental or approved agents, for combined use with HU and other therapeutics which enhance red cell viability in the globin disorders.
