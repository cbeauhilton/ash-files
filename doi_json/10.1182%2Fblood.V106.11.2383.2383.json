    "abstract_text": "Immune competent cells which possess both abilities to present tumor antigens to effector \u03b1\u03b2 T cells and to act by themselves as effector cells of anti-tumor immune reaction, if they would exist, are thought to be useful cells for establishing an efficient anti-tumor cellular immunotherapy. We identified human V\u03b32V\u03b42 T cells to be the multi-functional cells with the abilities of antigen presentation for antigen-specific immune reaction and anti-tumor cytotoxicity using non-peptides as antigens. Human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were expanded from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by the culture with zoledronate or isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and a low concentration of IL-2 for 1\u20132 weeks. Immature dendritic cells were generated from blood non-adherent cells or anti-CD14 microbead-separated monocytes by the culture with GM-CSF and IL-4 for 6\u20138 days and mature dendritic cells were induced from immature dendritic cells by the additional 2 days-culture with TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6 and PGE 2 . Cultured \u03b3\u03b4 T cell-containing cells were analyzed for the expression of surface phenotypes and cytoplasmic molecules by flow cytometry. The supernatant of the culture of anti-\u03b3\u03b4 TCR microbead-separated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were assayed for the concentration of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-2 by cytometric bead array. The uptake ability of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were investigated by flow cytometry using FITC-dextran and Lucifer yellow. Antigen presenting ability of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was evaluated by mixed lymphocyte culture by using purified \u03b3\u03b4 T cells as stimulator cells and blood non-adherent cells or nai\u0308ve \u03b1\u03b2 T cells as responder cells in both autologous and allogeneic settings. In autologous settings, KLH or PPD were added as exogenous antigens to \u03b3\u03b4 T cells or dendritic cells for the whole duration of the culture. Anti-tumor cytotoxicity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was evaluated by 51 Cr-release assay by using purified \u03b3\u03b4 T cells as effector cells and leukemia/myeloma cell lines or fresh acute leukemia leukemia cells as target cells. Seventy to eighty percent of the cultured cells generated from blood mononuclear cells were positive for \u03b3\u03b4 TCR and almost all of the \u03b3\u03b4 TCR + cells possessed V\u03b42 TCR. Ten to twenty percient of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were positive for CD40/CD80 and most of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were positive for CD86/CD54/CD58/HLA-DR. The expanded \u03b3\u03b4T cells were shown to produce a remarkable amount of IFN-\u03b3 and a considerable amount of TNF-\u03b1 and the cytokine production was much increased by the addition of a low dose of IL-2. Cultured \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were shown to be able to uptake FITC-Dextran and lucifer yellow at a comparable level of immature dendritic cells. Purified and cultured \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were demonstrated to possess an allogeneic and antigen-specific autologous antigen presenting ability at a similar level of mature dendritic cells. Zoledronate/IL-2-expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were demonstrated to be cytotoxic against leukemia or myeloma cell lines and fresh acute leukemia leukemia cells at effector to target ratio dependent. The present study revealed that human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, which could be markedly expanded by the culture with zoledronate or IPP and IL-2, possess both functions of antigen presentation and anti-tumor cytotoxicity and might be efficiently applied to anti-tumor cellular immunotherapy."
