    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5188 Background: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and H 2 O 2 have roles signaling for molecules on angiogenesis. NADPH oxidase Nox2 (gp91phox) is a major source of ROS. Previous, we had found that Nox2-based NADPH oxidase (gp91 phox )-induced ROS may play important roles on EPCs migration and proliferation by VEGF (Blood. 2009;114:Abstract 1445). In the present study, we studied the impact of down-regulation of Nox2 on intracellular ROS level, proliferation, transmigration, and in vitro tube formation of HCB derived EPCs via Nox2 siRNA transfection. Methods: Outgrowing endothelial progenitor cells were established from mononuclear cells of human cord blood (Yoo et al , Stem cells. 2003;21:228-235) using EGM-2 media in a fibronectin-coated dish. EPCs were transfected with HiPerFection transfection reagent plus Nox2 siRNA or non-targeting control siRNA and cultured for 5 hours. 100ng/ml of VEGF was added to the transfected cells and cultured for overnight. Expression of Nox2 and pERK in the Nox2 siRNA transfected EPCs were detected by western blot analysis. Intracellular ROS level was analyzed by staining with 2, 7-dichlrodihydro-fluorescein-diacetate (H2DCF-DA) and flow cytometry. Transmigration against VEGF was performed using transwell system (Costar) and in vitro tube formation was assayed using In vitro angiogenesis kit (Chemicon). Results: Intracellular ROS level was increased during endothelial progenitor cell culture which were derived from HCB by VEGF treatment. Proliferation, in vitro tube formation matrigel assay and migration assay on endothelial progenitor cells using VEGF were decreased with Nox2 siRNA transfection when compared with that of control group. In western blot data, Nox2-based NADPH oxidase (gp91 phox ) was increased by VEGF and decreased by Nox2 siRNA transfection. VEGF induced pERK expression was also decreased by Nox2 siRNA transfection as well. Conclusions: Based on our studies, Nox2-based NADPH oxidase (gp91 phox )-induced ROS may have important roles on proliferation in HCB induced EPCs by VEGF stimulation. Furthermore, Nox2 siRNA transfection into HCB derived EPC down-regulated intracellular ROS production and pERK expression. Our data may be useful finding the new therapeutic targets for ischemic heart and ischemic limb diseases by manipulating the level of intracellular ROS via Nox2.
