    "abstract_text": "Imatinib effectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl, the molecular driver of CML. Emergence of imatinib resistance due to mutations within the Bcr-Abl kinase domain (KD) has prompted the development of new Abl kinase inhibitors. A particularly important target is Bcr-Abl(T315I), which accounts for 15\u201320% of patients with resistance. To address this unresolved need, we profiled the novel Abl kinase inhibitor SGX70393 against native and mutant Bcr-Abl. Methods: We assessed the efficacy of SGX70393 in cellular and biochemical assays against a panel of KD mutants. Cell proliferation assays and Bcr-Abl tyrosine phosphorylation immunoblot analyses were performed for parental Ba/F3 cells, Ba/F3 cells expressing unmutated Bcr-Abl, or Ba/F3 cells expressing a single Bcr-Abl KD mutation (M244V, G250E, Q252H, Y253F, Y253H, E255K, E255V, F311L, T315I, F317L, M351T, F359V, V379I, L387M, H396P, or H396R). The resistance profile of SGX70393 was also evaluated using a recently developed accelerated, cell-based mutagenesis assay (Bradeen, et al. Blood, June 2006; doi:10.1182). Results: SGX70393 inhibited growth of cells expressing Bcr-Abl(T315I) (IC50: 7.3 nM) or unmutated Bcr-Abl (IC50: 12 nM). Sensitivity of Bcr-Abl mutants to SGX70393 partitioned into three categories: high (IC50500 nM: G250E, Y253F, E255V, and F317L). A cell-based mutagenesis screen for Bcr-Abl kinase domain escape mutants emerging in the presence of SGX70393 revealed a concentration-dependent reduction in surviving clones, with five previously reported Bcr-Abl mutations (L248M; G250E; Y253F; E255V; F317V) accounting for almost all resistance. Conclusions: (a) SGX70393 is a potent inhibitor of native and T315I mutant Bcr-Abl. (b) SGX70393 coverage extends to most clinically relevant mutants except mutations of the p-loop and F317."
