    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2136 Imatinib has shown clinical efficacy against Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive leukemia cells and it is now the standard care for initial therapy. However, recent studies reported imatinib are not effective in quiescent primitive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) stem cells. Moreover, many Ph-positive leukemia patients develop resistance or fail to respond to imatinib by mutation in the ABL kinase domain in clinically. These results indicated that alternative combination therapy such as BCR-ABL targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and nontoxic agents are required to cure the Ph positive leukemia patients. Hedgehog (Hh)- Glioma-associated oncogene homolog (Gli) signaling regulates self-renewal of stem cells and implicates in a large number of human cancers. One of the Hh inhibitor, GDC-0449 is a potent small molecule inhibitor of Hedgehog-Gli pathway. It has been reported GDC-0449 showed high target specificity and demonstrated antiproliferative activity against tumors and it is now in clinical trial. Therefore, combination therapy using a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors and a Hedgehog-Gli inhibitor, GDC-0449 may help prevent CML relapse and these approaches may be expected to improve the outcomes of Ph-positive leukemia patients. In this study, we investigated the GDC-0449 efficacy by using the BCR-ABL positive cell lines, OM9;22, K562 and primary samples when leukemic cells were protected by the feeder cell line, S9 cells. We examined a comprehensive drug combination experiment using GDC-0449 and dual Src/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib. Gli proteins (Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3) were existed in Ph-positive cell lines. We found the cell numbers of OM9;22 were significantly increased with the feeder cell line, S9 cells compared to without S9 cells. The treatment of dasatinib exhibits cell growth inhibition partially against OM9;22 cells in the presence of feeder cell line, S9 cells. Caspase-3 activity by 100 nM dasatinib treatment was also reduced in the presence of S9 cells. 72 h of combined treatment of Ph-positive leukemia cells with 10 \u03bcM of GDC-0449 and 100 nM of dasatinib in the presence of feeder cell line, caused significantly more cytotoxicity than each drug alone. We next investigated the efficacy and intracellular signaling of GDC-0449. The treatment of GDC-0449 exhibits cell growth inhibition and induced apoptosis against OM9;22 cells in a dose and time dependent manner. Expression of Gli1 and Gli2 proteins were reduced after GDC-0449 treatment. 10 \u03bcM of GDC-0449 also inhibited the growth of Ph-positive primary samples by colony assay. Another Hh inhibitor, SANT-2 also exhibits cell growth inhibition against OM9;22 cells in a dose dependent manner. Data from this study suggested that administration of the Hh inhibitor, GDC-0449 may be a powerful strategy against Ph-positive leukemia cells and enhance cytotoxic effects of dasatinib in the presence of feeder cell.
