    "abstract_text": "Abstract 445 Background: Carfilzomib is a proteasome inhibitor that irreversibly binds its target and has a favorable toxicity profile that has shown significant activity in relapsed multiple myeloma (MM), leading to recent FDA accelerated approval. To achieve rapid and deep response in patients eligible for stem cell transplant, we combined carfilzomib with the regimen of cyclophosphamide-thalidomide-dexamethasone (CTD). We recently reported the results of the Phase I component of the trial (in which no MTD was reached) followed by the initial Phase II trial; however, with increasing evidence for the safe and effective use of higher doses of carfilzomib, we now report results from dose escalation extension of the Phase II trial. Methods: Newly diagnosed myeloma patients intended for stem cell transplant were eligible. All patients were treated on a 28 day cycle with Carfilzomib IV Days 1,2,8,9,15,16 (see Table 1 below for dosing per cohort) along with Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 PO Days 1,8,15, Thalidomide 100 mg PO Days 1\u201328 and Dexamethasone 40 mg PO Days 1,8,15,22. We initially conducted a Phase I run in trial of 6 patients with no DLT observed before expanding to the Phase II portion of the study. The initial phase II regimen is shown below \u2013 as no DLTs were observed, we have now fully accrued to the Phase II dose level +1. Treatment was for 4 cycles with expected SCT post induction. The primary endpoint of the trial is the proportion of patients who have \u2265very good partial response (VGPR) to treatment. All patients received herpes zoster prophylaxis and ASA daily.

View Large Results: A total of 38 patients have been accrued to the trial, 6 in the initial Phase 1, 21 in the initial Phase II, and the remaining at dose escalated cohorts. We are reporting the 27 patients who have completed therapy and will update with the dose escalated cohorts. Median age was 65 (range 27\u201374) and 52% were female. ISS Stage was advanced (II-III) in 56%. Best overall response rate during 4 cycles of CYCLONE at dose level 0 is 96%: CR 29%, VGPR 46%, PR 21% (1 pt achieved MR). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher at least possibly related to CYCLONE occurred in 12 (44%). Most commonly reported non hematological toxicities (all grades) included fatigue (67%), constipation (56%), lethargy (41%) somnolence (37%), malaise (30%) depressed level of consciousness (22%); however, grade 3/4 toxicities occurring in >5% were uncommon: thromboembolic event 11%) and muscle weakness (7%). Two cases of pneumonia required hospitalization. Eight patients (30%) developed grade 1 sensory neuropathy; no higher grade or painful neuropathy was evident. There were no cardiac events seen in greater than 5% of patients. Grade 3/4 hematological toxicities included neutropenia (15%) and lymphopenia (7%). All patients advancing to SCT successfully collected stem cells. One patient died on study from pneumonia. Conclusion: The 4 drug CYCLONE regimen is highly efficaceous with a response rate after only 4 cycles of 96% (75% \u2265VGPR, 29% CR) at the current dosing level of carfilzomib IV 20/27 mg/m 2 in newly diagnosed myeloma. Toxicities are manageable, with only grade 1 neuropathy and minimal cardiac or pulmonary toxicity. Increasing the dose of carfilzomib is feasible and updated results of dose escalated cohorts will be reported at 20/36 and 20/45 mg/m 2 .
