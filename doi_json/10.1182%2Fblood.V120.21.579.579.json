    "abstract_text": "Abstract 579 Stimulation of NK cells with the HLA-deficient cell line K562 genetically modified to express 41BB-ligand and interleukin (IL) 15 allows for the production of large numbers of highly activated NK cells for therapy (Fujisaki et al, Cancer Res. 2009;69:4010\u20134017). We tested the safety, persistence and anti-MM activity of these ex-vivo expanded NK cells (ENK) in patients with high-risk MM relapsing after AUTO-PBSCT. Apheresis products were obtained from MM patients (AUTO-ENK) or from killer immunoglobulin-like receptor-ligand (KIR-L) mismatched haplo-identical family donors (ALLO-ENK). The preparative regimen comprised bortezomib only (Bor, days \u22129, \u22126, and \u22122) or Bor and immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide (Cy, day \u22127) and fludarabine (Flu, days \u22125 to \u22122), see Table 1 . ENK cells were produced at the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy (CAGT) in Houston, shipped to UAMS either cryopreserved or fresh (see separate abstract), infused on day 0 and followed by daily administrations of 3\u00d710 6 units of IL2 (13 doses total) to support ENK cell persistence in vivo . Flow cytometry was used to determine immunophenotype and the absolute number of NK and T cells in blood. Chimerism was assessed by PCR for donor specific short tandem repeats. Standard 4h chromium release assays were used to assess potency of ENK against MM cells. Of 6 patients treated, ENK cell doses of 2\u20138\u00d710 7 /kg (with T cell doses in ALLO-ENK products limited to <5\u00d710 5 /kg) were safely infused. IL2 therapy-induced rigors and grade II fever were the most common adverse events. No in vivo expansion was observed in the 3 patients receiving cryopreserved ENK products. One patient had stable disease for 3 months followed by slow disease progression. The other two patients experienced early progression, with one succumbing to MM. The 3 subsequent patients received fresh ENK products and transient expansion in vivo was observed in all 3, peaking at day 7 (absolute number of NK cells/\u03bcl blood: 512, 547, 153; NK cell percentage of lymphocytes: 49%, 92%, 64%). For the fresh ALLO-ENK cell recipient we confirmed that the in vivo expanded cells ( Figure 1 A) were derived from the donor (> 92\u201395% donor chimerism on days 5, 7 and 9). Furthermore, NK cells isolated from the blood on days 5 and 7 avidly killed recipient MM cells ( Figure 1 B). Unfortunately, this patient died of septic shock 11 days post-infusion and clinical response could not be evaluated. While non-expanded NK cells expressed low levels of CD26 and CD70, these molecules were highly expressed on ENK cells and NK cells in the PB post-ENK cell infusion, suggesting that CD26 and CD70 can be used to track the infused cells. AUTO-ENK cells failed to kill recipient MM in vitro but significant killing of third party MM cells (43%, 63%) and K562 (80%, 78%) was observed (effector: target ratio of 10:1). In keeping with this, the two patients who received fresh AUTO-ENK had progressive disease. Patients receiving Cy/Flu had increased serum levels of the NK cell growth factor IL15 (median 34 vs. 4pg/ml, respectively). High frequencies of CD25+/Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (24%, 44%, 47% of the CD3+/4+ lymphocytes) were observed 14 days after ENK infusion in 3/4 patients studied and we are investigating whether these cells were involved in ENK cell suppression. In conclusion, this study has established the safety and feasibility of infusing up to 8\u00d710 7 /kg ENK cells. We only observed dramatic in vivo expansion of fresh ENK suggesting that infusing fresh rather than freeze-thawed ENK cells is critical. ALLO-ENK cells isolated from the PB post-infusion killed recipient MM cells. In contrast, this was not observed with AUTO-ENK cells suggesting that further optimization of the AUTO-ENK cell approach may be required to overcome KIR-L induced inhibition. In addition, studies are under way to determine whether suppression by T regulatory cells, soluble factors, or suboptimal IL15 surge may prove important in modulating ENK activity and in vivo persistence.
