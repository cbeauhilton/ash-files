    "abstract_text": "CD4 + CD25 + T reg cells may be important immune regulators for the maintenance of immune tolerance after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In the well-established canine model of nonmyeloablative HCT, stable mixed donor/host hematopoietic chimerism persists for the lifespan of the recipient following 2 Gray total body irradiation, dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-identical bone marrow transplantation and combined postgrafting immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine for 4 and 5 weeks, respectively. We hypothesized that CD4 + CD25 + T reg are an important component of the active cellular mechanism of peripheral tolerance that maintains stable mixed chimerism in this HCT model. Previously, we showed that depletion of CD4 + CD25 + T reg cells from mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) significantly increased allo-specific proliferation in the DLA-mismatched setting. In the current study, we asked if depletion of CD4 + CD25 + T reg from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from dogs with stable mixed chimerism 1 to 4 years after nonmyeloablative HCT could generate minor histocompatibility antigen (mHAg)-specific, host anti-donor cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Responder PBMC from mixed chimeric dogs were cultured in a modified MLC with irradiated, CD34 + derived dendritic cells (DC) from the respective DLA-identical HCT donor at a 10:1 responder: stimulator ratio. On day 4 of MLC, CD4 + CD25 + T cells were depleted by either immunomagnetic selection (Miltenyi) using the anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (ACT-1) or the addition of 10 \u221211 M denileukin diftitox (DAB 389 IL-2, Ontak) for 18 hours. DAB 389 IL-2 is a fusion protein consisting of the ADP-ribosyltransferase domain of diphtheria toxin and IL-2. By flow cytometry analysis, depletion of CD4 + CD25 bright+ was 60%\u201366% with immunomagnetic selection and 70%\u201377% with DAB 389 IL-2. On day 5, culture media was changed to remove residual DAB 389 IL-2 in the respective flasks. A secondary MLC was established with CD4 + CD25 + depleted responder cells and irradiated DC from the respective DLA-identical HCT donor. Peak proliferation of responder cells measured by 3 H-thymidine incorporation was on day 4 of secondary MLC. There was a 54%\u201395% increase in proliferation of cells depleted of CD4 + CD25 + T cells with immunomagnetic selection and a 121%\u2013133% increase in proliferation of DAB 389 IL-2 treated cells compared with non-depleted responder cells. We evaluated mHAg-specific cytotoxic activity of the CD4 + CD25 + depleted responder T cells by 51 Cr release assay following 3 rd MLC stimulation with respective DC. At a 10:1 effector: target ratio, there was 74%\u201382% specific lysis of the respective HCT donor cells by the CD4 + CD25 + depleted responder T cells, while the non-depleted control responder cells had 4%\u20136% specific lysis. PCR analysis with informative microsatellite markers confirmed the alloreactive CTL were of host origin. In summary, depletion of CD4 + CD25 + T reg from PBMC of mixed chimeras permitted the emergence of host anti-donor mHAg-specific CTL. These data suggest that mHAg-specific host anti-donor T cells persist in the peripheral blood of stable mixed chimeric dogs and that peripheral CD4 + CD25 + T reg prevent alloreactive immune responses and maintain mixed chimerism. These results support the hypothesis that mixed hematopoietic chimerism established without T cell depletion relies on peripheral immune tolerance mechanisms.",
