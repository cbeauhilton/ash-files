    "abstract_text": "Introduction . Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare chronic B cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by massive infiltration of the spleen by cells displaying a unique \u201chairy\u201d morphology and surface phenotype. The ontogeny of hairy cells (HCs) and the mechanism underlying their accumulation in the spleen remain elusive. Growing evidence indicates that B cell-activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) play important roles in malignant B cells. BAFF and APRIL are usually produced by myeloid cells and engage three receptors on B cells known as transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophylin ligand interactor (TACI), B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), and BAFF receptor (BAFF-R). APRIL binding to TACI and BCMA is reinforced by cell-anchored and matrix-associated heparan-sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs). In this study we verified the role of BAFF and APRIL in HCL. Methods . Splenic tissue sections and B cells from 5 healthy donors and 5 HCL patients were analyzed for expression of BAFF, APRIL, TACI, BCMA, BAFF-R and other molecules through immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, immunoblotting and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. HCs were also cultured with umbilical vein or splenic endothelial cells in the presence or absence of BAFF and APRIL inhibitors, including soluble TACI-Ig decoy receptor, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and HSPG-modifying agents, such as heparinitase. HC proliferation, survival and signaling as induced by recombinant BAFF or APRIL were evaluated through standard assays. Results . We found that splenic sinusoids surrounding HCs were comprised of endothelial cells expressing APRIL and, to a lesser extent, BAFF. Endothelial cells up-regulated BAFF and APRIL upon exposure to HC-derived cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1. Unlike nai\u0308ve, germinal center, memory and plasmacytoid B cells but similar to splenic marginal zone B cells, HCs expressed high levels of TACI, BCMA, BAFF-R and HSPGs together with CD1c, CD11c, CD27, CD83, CD123, endocytic receptors, and carbohydrate receptors. Preliminary data indicated that endothelial cells stimulated HCs through a mechanism involving BAFF, APRIL and HSPGs as pretreatment of endothelial cells with BAFF and APRIL small interfering RNAs or heparinitase attenuated the growth and survival of HCs in co-cultures. TACI-Ig, which binds to and neutralizes BAFF and APRIL, had a similar inhibitory effect. Conversely, BAFF, APRIL as well as TACI, BCMA or BAFF-R cross-linking stimulated HC growth. This stimulation was associated with NF-\u03baB activation as well as up-regulation of various pro-survival and growth-inducing intracellular proteins. Conclusions . The present findings suggest that HCs may derive from a splenic marginal zone B cell precursor. In addition, our studies indicate that splenic sinusoids form a BAFF-APRIL-HSPG-rich niche that promotes HC expansion via TACI, BCMA and BAFF-R. Finally, our data suggest that blocking BAFF and APRIL through TACI-Ig, siRNAs and HSPG-modifying agents could have therapeutic value in HCL."
