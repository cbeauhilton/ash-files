    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3472 Background: The JAK2V617F gene mutation is a common feature of Essential Thrombocythemia (ET), Polycythemia Vera (PV) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF); however the disease can occur without the JAK2 mutation suggesting that ET, PV and PMF share a common molecular mechanisms which is still unknown. In addition, in patients with the JAK2V617F mutation a substantial proportion of progenitor cells do not bear the JAK2V617F mutation and it is still unclear whether this population is normal or not. Methods: 64 patients affected by MPNs and 12 healthy subjects were included in the study. Twenty three patients were affected by ET, 25 by PV and 22 by PMF. We analyzed the expression, of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-xL, both at mRNA and protein level by qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence assay with specific antibodies. Erythroblasts, CD34+ and CD34+CD38-cell populations were selected and analyzed. Moreover, we designed specific PNA (Peptide Nucleic Acid) for JAK2V617F and for Bcl-xL isoform to identify their presence/expression at single CD34+ cell level. Results: Bcl-xL protein and mRNA were found progressively over-expressed in erythroblasts, in CD34+ and in CD34+ CD38- cells from ET, PV and PMF patients without any differences between JAK2V617F and wild type (WT) patients. The median protein level in erythroblasts increased from 22 Relative Units (RU) in ET, to 68,5 in PV and to 85 in PMF. Similarly, in CD34+ Bcl-xL increased from 30 RU in ET, to 89 RU in PV, and to 135 RU in PMF. Finally, CD34+CD38-increased from 17.4 RU in ET, to 45.5 RU in PV, to 101.7 RU in PMF. In addition, analysis by PNA identified distinct progenitor cells population. In patients bearing the JAK2 mutation, three CD34+ cell sub-populations were found: (a) one JAK2 positive and with high levels of Bcl-xL; (b) one JAK2 negative and with high levels of Bcl-xL. Thus, the cell population showing high levels of Bcl-xL is always greater than the JAK2 positive one; (c) one double negative population. In patients without JAK2 mutation, two CD34+ cell populations are identified: (a) one characterized by high levels of Bcl-xL and (b) one double negative. The distribution of these cell subpopulations is different in the distinct MPN. Conclusions: We have identified a previously undisclosed CD34+ cell population which is characterized by high level of Bcl-xL expression and represents the majority of CD34+ cells both in wild type and mutated samples. Interestingly, in mutated samples, this population encompasses the JAK2 mutated one. These findings suggest that Bcl-xL plays an important role in MPN, although it remains undisclosed whether this activation is dependent from an upstream oncogenetic signal. Finally, with this technique we can now identify a putative residual normal CD34+ cells in MPN which may be useful for monitoring patients undergoing targeted therapy with inhibitors. Altogether, these findings disclose unfolded aspects of pathophysiology of MPN and may contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of MPN.
