    "abstract_text": "Platelets play prominent and unique roles in the kinetics of the coagulation process. Modulated by the flow conditions, they control coagulation in various ways: (1) by integrin activation and ensuing clot retraction; (2) via exposure of the procoagulant phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS), which causes binding of a specific set of coagulation factors at the platelet surface with as a result tenase activation and thrombin generation; (3) by initiating fibrin fiber formation at the platelet surface, a process specifically catalyzed by coated platelets. Recent evidence points to fibrin as an active structural network, which provides binding sides for plasma factors and platelets and, thereby, provides an important feedback mechanism for the stimulation of platelet activation. This overview will focus on novel insights into the signaling and activation processes in platelets that regulate these distinct procoagulant functions. One key mechanism is the activation and secondary closure of integrin alphaIIb-beta3. Another key mechanism concerns the calcium-dependent exposure of PS, which is accompanied by swelling of the platelets. Together, these processes control not only platelet adhesion, but also the accessibility for coagulation factors. Major distortions in these procoagulant functions are seen in platelets from a patient with the Scott syndrome, a rare bleeding disorder associated with mutations in the calcium-dependent ion channel protein anoctamin-6 (gene ANO6 , previously TMEM16A ). These platelets are deficient in calcium-induced PS exposure, swelling, integrin inactivation and in the formation of thrombin and fibrin at the platelet surface. These dysfunctions are precisely phenocopied in mice lacking anoctamin-6 expression. Advanced platelet proteomics analysis indicated that the deficiency in anoctamin-6 was accompanied by decreased calpain-dependent cleavage of a whole spectrum of intracellular proteins, and an increased phosphorylation state of many signaling and cytoskeletal proteins. However, calcium signaling in the Scott platelets was unchanged. In contrast, reports on patients with a gain in platelet procoagulant function, the Stormorken syndrome, indicate a link with genetic mutation in the calcium signaling protein STIM1. The possible consequences of these novel insights for our understanding of haemorrhagic and thrombotic deseases will be discussed. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
