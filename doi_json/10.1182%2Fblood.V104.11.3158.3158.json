    "abstract_text": "CMV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who have undergone ASCT. We previously evaluated the efficacy of ODG (5mg/kg/day) for 21 days as pre-emptive treatment for CMV viremia and found it to be effective and better tolerated than twice daily doses. We now report data evaluating ODG and PT using a quantitative CMV PCR strategy. At our institution, the detection limit of whole blood CMV PCR (WBP) is 200 copies/ml and the lower limit of quantitation 2000 copies/ml. No criteria for a standard treatment threshold currently exist for quantitative CMV PCR in plasma or whole blood. We elected to initiate treatment with ODG using a threshold WBP \u226510,000 copies/ml in clinically stable patients. Dose escalation was permitted for increasing WBP on ODG treatment. From 4/03 to 3/04, 98 patients underwent ASCT (44 related donors and 54 unrelated donors). 69/98 patients were at risk for CMV reactivation (donor/recipient CMV seropositive). Median follow-up was 318 (120\u2013478) days post transplant. 48/69 (69.6%) patients had 1 or more episodes of CMV viremia (WBP >200 copies/ml). In 5/48 (10.4%) patients the WBP remained 200 copies/ml) and 51.7 (27\u2013196) days (\u226510,000 copies/ml) post transplant. 10/28 patients increased ganciclovir to 5mg/kg/BID a mean of 12 (4\u201319) days after initiation of therapy due to increasing WBP (30,200\u2013231,000 copies/ml). One patient developed neutropenia and was changed to foscarnet. In patients for whom WBP were available for the time points indicated, time to clearance of viremia (\u22642000 copies/ml) for the 28 patients was 1/21 (5%) week 1, 8/25 (32%) week 2, 14/26 (54%) week 3, 22/27 (82%) week 4 and 26/28 (93%) week 5. Two patients did not clear their viremia at 5 weeks. One developed CMV colitis which was successfully treated. 17/28 patients remained on ODG for the 21 day treatment period. Time to clearance of viremia in this group was 1/10 (10%) week 1, 8/14 (57%) week 2, 12/15 (80%) week 3, 15/16 (94%) week 4, and 17/17 (100%) week 5. Recurrent viremia (WBP \u226510,000 copies/ml) occurred in 12/28 (43%) patients a mean of 109 (54\u2013247) days post transplant. 2/28 (7%) patients developed CMV disease (colitis), 1 during the initial episode of viremia and 1 during a recurrence. Both were successfully treated. There were no deaths due to CMV disease in patients initiating therapy with ODG. Conclusion: Delaying treatment with ODG as initial PT until WBP \u226510,000 copies/ml is a safe and effective treatment strategy for CMV viremia post ASCT. This strategy reduces over treatment of patients and neutropenia.",
