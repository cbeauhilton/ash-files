    "abstract_text": "Purpose: Generic dasatinib, a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), was approved as a second-line treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in chronic phase (CP) in china. We initiated a prospective, multi-center and single-arm clinical trial (NCT04925141) from May 2016 to October 2018 to evaluate efficacy and safety of generic dasatinib as first-line treatment in China. The primary endpoint was achieved, here we reported the 2 years follow-up results to see its long-term clinical benefit in Chinese patients. Methods: The study included the newly diagnosed CML-CP patients who was diagnosed by the presence of Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and/or presence of BCR-ABL fusion gene. Key inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) Age \u2265 18 years; 2) The CML subjects in chronic phase with the Ph+ definitive diagnosis were within 6 months before the onset of administration of the study drug; 3) The ECOG performance grades of 0-2; 4) Sufficient main organ functions. All newly diagnosed patients were given 100mg/d (initial dose) of the generic dasatinib. The primary endpoint was molecular major response (MMR) calculated based on the BCR-ABL1 \u2264 0.1% at the 12th month. Secondary endpoints were proportion of subjects who achieved and maintained MMR at 3, 6, and 18 months; Cumulative MMR rates at 6, 12, and 24 months were determined. All patients were followed up through the hospital outpatient departments at second, fourth and eighth weeks, and third, sixth, ninth, twelfth, eighteenth, and twenty-fourth months. The follow-up ended on December 6, 2019. The SAS 9.2 software was utilized for all statistical analyses in this study, and the two-sided test was performed to see variances. Results: A total of 59 patients were included in this trail, with median age of 44 (19 - 70), and 7% of the subjects were at high risk based on the Sokal index for the disease prognosis. The primary endpoint MMR rate at the 12th month was 80.8% which had been published. At 12 months, the cumulative response rate (CCyR) was 85.5% (47/55) and the cumulative MMR was 76.4% (42/55). Here we are reporting the 2 years follow ups. At 24 months, the complete hematological response (CHR) was 88.4%, the cumulative MMR rate was 73.7%, the cumulative MR4.0 rate was 63.6%, the cumulative MR4.5 rate was 58.2%, and the cumulative complete molecular response (CMR) rate was 58.2%. The most common adverse events (AEs) was thrombocytopenia (42.4%) in hematology and pleural effusion (20.3%) in non-hematology, only 11.9% and 1.7% of whom were grade III~IV respectively. Conclusion: This was the first report on domestic dasatinib as the first-line treatment for CML-CP patients received a clinical benefit with 24 months in China. Safety was similar with that of the original study data. Figure 1 View large Download slide Figure 1 View large Download slide  Close modal Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
