    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Several studies reported combined contraceptives influence in hemostatic and lipid profile besides the concern about the thromboembolism and cardiovascular risks due to the steroids hormones use. As women with hemoglobin (Hb) variants have a pre-existing inflammatory condition and c onsidering the high frequency of hemoglobin variant worldwide, this study aims to evaluate the association of hematological, lipid, glicemic, inflammatory and hemostatic profiles in women using combined oral contraceptives and carriers of hemoglobin variants. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study including 591 women in reproductive-age. We investigated their hemoglobin profile and COCs use. Of them, we included 60 women with HbAA, 21 with HbAC, 25 with HbAS and 7 with HbSC profiles, all of them combined oral contraceptives users. Among those combined oral contraceptives nonusers, 9 were HbAC and 19 HbSC. We evaluated fasting serum glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, D-dimer and hematological profile among the studied groups. This study was conducted in accordance and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz - FIOCRUZ, Brazil; and also with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, and its revisions. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare two groups of values within the same variable. Results: We observed significant differences in some hematological and cardiometabolic parameters in women carriers of different Hb variants and using COCs. We found relevant increases in CRP levels in HbSC and HbAC women that seem to be associated with different types of progestins present in combined oral contraceptives formulations. Also, combined oral contraceptives use seems to be associated with decreased HDL-c levels in HbAC women. Otherwise, D-dimer levels were increased in all women with Hb variants, independently of the contraceptive use. Conclusions: Although combined oral contraceptive remains an important method to prevent unintended pregnancy, our data suggest that contraception in women carriers of Hb variants, including those in heterozygosis, should be carefully evaluated, especially, considering the pre-existent inflammatory and pro-thrombotic conditions that together with combined oral contraceptive use may result in additional health problems, such as cardiovascular and thromboembolic diseases.
