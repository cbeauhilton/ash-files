    "abstract_text": "Childhood leukaemia which is refractory to chemotherapy or which relapses early following stem cell transplantation (SCT) has a very poor prognosis, with few patients becoming long-term survivors. Establishing limited graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in an attempt to exert a graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) response in these patients remains the only curative option. Second SCT procedures and/or donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) have achieved some success but the pace of acute leukaemia is often too fast and the occurrence of GVHD/GVL too unpredictable to achieve this goal. We postulated that the addition of alpha interferon (alphaIFN) might induce/augment and control GVHD/GVL in this group of patients and so improve outcome. Thirteen patients underwent initial SCT, for cALL CR2 (n=1), Philadelphia positive ALL CR1 (5), MDS/AML (2), refractory AML (2), and CML (3), with unrelated (9) or sibling donors (4). Eight patients subsequently had a frank haematological relapse and 4 patients a molecular relapse of their leukaemia at a median of 10 months (2\u201318 months) from 1st SCT. Six patients underwent a 2nd SCT from the same donor, all with reduced intensity conditioned regimes; all received alphaIFN when GVHD did not occur after early withdrawal of immunosuppression. One (ALL CR2) received DLI 2 months after 2nd SCT for mixed chimerism. A further six patients received DLI plus alphaIFN, 3/6 together with low dose DLI (<106/kg); 3/6 had previously received108/kg DLI alone without response. One patient with refractory AML received alphaIFN in conjunction with the initial transplant. The dose of alphaIFN was escalated from 3\u20135 megaunits/m2 subcutaneously 3\u20135 days per week as tolerated and continued in the absence of GVHD for up to one year. 3 patients (CML) received concomitant therapy with Glivec, which has now been stopped. Following therapy, 9/13 (69%) patients developed aGVHD: Grade I (1), grade II (4), grade III (4); and 7/11 evaluable patients cGVHD: limited (4), extensive (3). 8 of 13 (62%) remain well and in remission, a median of 23 months (range 12 to 100) from alphaIFN therapy. Five have died: 2 from relapse, one from lung GVHD, one from idiopathic pneumonitis and one from aspergillus infection. Two of 8 surviving patients have ongoing cGVHD requiring immunosuppressive therapy. This data shows promising results for the use of alphaIFN to augment GVL responses in patients with high-risk leukaemia not cured with standard transplant procedures with 62% disease free survival and minimal residual symptoms. Further analysis is warranted."
