    "abstract_text": "Background: Studying gene expression and clinical outcome data from 136 clinical trials for patients with cancer (~21,000 patients with 26 cancer types), we found CD25 as one of the strongest predictors of poor clinical outcome in patients with B-cell malignancies, but not in other cancer types. This was unexpected because CD25 is known as one of three chains of the IL2 receptor on T-cells and NK-cells. Interleukin-2 (IL2) functions as essential T-cell growth factor. IL2 signals through b- and g-, but not a-chains (CD25) of its heterotrimeric receptor. CD25-deficiency causes lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity, however, its mechanistic role is unclear. Results: Our experiments based on genetic mouse models and engineered patient-derived B-cell leukemia and lymphoma xenografts revealed that CD25 expressed on B-cells is not an IL2 receptor chain, but in fact binds downstream signaling molecules of the B-cell receptor (BCR). Through these interactions, CD25 mediates negative feedback to BCR signaling in response to antigen-encounter in normal B-cells. Defects in CD25 - / - B-cells were not replicated in mice that express CD25 but lack expression of the IL2 cytokine. These findings demonstrate IL2-independent functions of CD25 in B-cells and B-cell derived leukemia and lymphoma. To comprehensively study the interactome of the short cytoplasmic tail of CD25, we performed proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID). This analysis revealed that the CD25 tail exerts negative feedback control through recruitment of the PKC\u03b2-scaffold RACK1 and the inhibitory phosphatase SHIP1 ( see schematic, left ). Interestingly, the cytoplasmic tail of CD25 harbors a PKC\u03b2-substrate motif and mutation of a central serine residue (S268) to A268 compromised interactions with PKC\u03b2, its scaffold RACK1 and SHIP1, demonstrating that feedback control was dependent on PKC\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation of CD25-S268. A genetic observation in a family with monogenic autoimmunity confirmed the functional importance of the cytoplasmic CD25-tail motif: a mutation immediately preceding S268 compromised CD25-surface translocation, which was restored by homology-directed repair of the S268. In vitro kinase assay with 62 candidate kinases against recombinant cytoplasmic tail of CD25-S268 or -A268 identified PKC\u03b2 as top-ranking kinase hit for CD25-S268 but not CD25-A268. Our genetic studies revealed that PKC\u03b2 is required for cell-membrane translocation of CD25, but also transcriptional expression of CD25 via NF-\u03baB activation. Therefore, PKC\u03b2 act as critical effector molecule downstream of CD25 to mediate B-cell selection during normal B-cell development and calibrate oncogenic BCR signaling in B-cell tumors. In B-cell malignancies, BCR-dependent survival and proliferation signals are often substituted by oncogenic BCR-mimics (e.g. BCR-ABL1 , JAK2 , BRAF V600E , LMP2A, CD79B mutations; see schematic, right ). Accordingly, we identified CD25 surface-expression as biomarker of oncogenic BCR-signaling and predictor of poor clinical outcomes. CD25 - / - B-cell leukemia failed to initiate fatal disease in transplant recipients. Owing to imbalances of oncogenic BCR-signaling and p53-checkpoint activation, CD25 -/- B-cell leukemia failed to initiate fatal disease in transplant recipients. In patient-derived xenograft models of drug-resistant B-cell malignancies, treatment with a CD25-specific antibody drug-conjugate (ADCT-301) extended survival of transplant recipients or eradicated disease. These findings identified CD25 as previously unrecognized feedback regulator of oncogenic BCR-signaling and provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of CD25 in refractory B-cell malignancies.
