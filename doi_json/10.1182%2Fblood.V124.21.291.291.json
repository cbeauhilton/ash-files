    "abstract_text": "Introduction Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint receptor that inhibits T cell activation upon interaction with its ligands PD-L1 or PD-L2 . Increased PD-L1 expression has been reported in various lymphoid malignancies, and may allow these tumors to circumvent host anti-tumor immunity. Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 monoclonal PD-1 receptor blocking antibody, potentiates T cell activity, and has clinical efficacy in various solid tumors. We hypothesized that nivolumab might also have clinically important anti-tumor activity in patients with lymphoid malignancies. Methods This open-label study enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoid malignancies including B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), T-cell NHL (T-NHL), multiple myeloma (MM), and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Patients were treated using a dose escalation design (1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg) of nivolumab administered every two weeks for up to two years. Responses were assessed using standard criteria. The primary endpoint was safety; key secondary endpoints included anti-tumor activity and expression of immunomodulatory proteins in tumor biopsies. The preliminary results for the cHL patients will be reported separately. Results Twenty-nine patients with B-NHL, 2 patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma; 23 patients with T-NHL; 27 patients with MM; and 1 with chronic myelogenous leukemia were enrolled. Patients were heavily pretreated with 67%, 69%, and 78% of MM, B-NHL, and T-NHL patients, respectively, having received \u2265 3 prior treatment regimens. Previous autologous stem cell transplantation was reported for 56% of MM, 14% of B-NHL, and 9% of T-NHL patients. Prior brentuximab treatment was reported in 7% of B-NHL and 26% of T-NHL patients. When this pre-planned interim analysis was performed, six patients had been treated at the 1 mg/kg dose with 2 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurring in the same patient: grade 3 pneumonia and pneumonitis. At the 3mg/kg dose, seven patients were treated with one patient experiencing two DLTs: grade 3 eosinophilia and diplopia. Additional patients were enrolled in the cohort expansion at 3 mg/kg. Drug-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 72%, 65%, and 52% of B-NHL, T-NHL, and MM patients, respectively. Serious AEs in B-NHL patients were pneumonitis (7%), acute respiratory distress syndrome, dermatitis, diplopia, enteritis, eosinophilia, mucosal inflammation, pyrexia and vomiting, each occurring in 3%. In the T-NHL patients, serious AEs were pneumonitis, rash, and sepsis, each occurring in 4%, and in MM patients, serious AEs were pneumonitis, myositis, and increased creatine phosphokinase, each occurring in 4%. The incidence and severity of drug related AEs were similar across tumor types. Efficacy results are shown for each tumor type in the table. The overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) rate in patients with B-NHL were 28% and 7%, respectively, including an ORR of 36% in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and 40% in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). In patients with T-NHL, ORR was 17% (no CR), including an ORR of 40% in the 5 patients with peripheral T cell lymphoma. No objective responses were observed in MM. Analysis of PD-L1 expression and correlation to clinical outcome is being performed and will be presented. Conclusions Nivolumab administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg every two weeks was tolerable and the safety profile was similar to that of the agent in solid tumors. Objective responses were observed in DLBCL, FL, mycosis fungoides (MF), and peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). Durable stable disease was observed in relapsed MM. The results of this phase 1 study have led to phase 2 studies in DLBCL and FL, which are ongoing. Table: Efficacy Results  Tumor . N . Complete Response n (%) . Partial Response n (%) .
