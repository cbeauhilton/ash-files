    "abstract_text": "Leg ulcers are the most common clinical manifestations of sickle cell anemia (SCA), a monogenic disease with huge clinical diversity among patients. They affect 8% to 10% of SCA patients, reaching a percentage greater than 50% in patients residing in tropical areas. These ulcers occur due to vascular occlusion, tissue hypoxia, hemolysis and genetic factors, presenting a slow healing, high recurrence rate and huge susceptibility to infection. Recently, some studies have shown a positive relationship between the complement system and the development of some vascular diseases and injuries such as leg ulcers in non-SCA patients. Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is an important component of the humoral innate immune system, and MBL possesses several characteristics indicating that it may play an essential role in wound healing; modulating inflammation and contributing to the clearance of microorganisms and apoptotic cells. In a recent study of chronic leg and foot ulcer patients, serum MBL levels were significantly different between wounds of different etiologies, with chronic venous leg ulcers patients having a higher frequency of MBL deficiency. Polymorphisms in the MBL2 are associated with a reduction in the MBL protein serum levels, increasing risk of developing leg ulcers and also the maintenance of these wounds, compromising the integrity of the immune defence and its response to potential invading pathogens. Here, we aimed to determine the frequency of polymorphisms in the promoter region -221 (Y / X) and -550 (H / L) and exon 1 of the MBL2 and assess the clinical impact of these variants in a northeastern Brazilian SCA population who presented leg ulcers. Two-hundred seventy-five unrelated SCA patients were included. According the leg ulcers presence, the total cohort was classified in patients presenting current or prior history of leg ulcers (n=100) and SCA patients above 18 years with no history of leg ulcers (n=175). Molecular analysis was performed by qPCR. Our population was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The allelic frequency of haplotypes associated with high MBL production (HYA, LYA) was 54.5% for cases and 62.9% in controls. The genotypes related to low MBL production (HYO, LYO) in cases and controls was 27.5% and 18.6%, respectively. The frequency of genotype related to intermediate MBL production (LXA) was 18% in cases and 18.5% in controls. We had no statistically significant results when we analyzed only the polymorphisms ( P >0.05). However, the phenotypic analysis between high and low MBL production revealed that patients with leg ulcers have lower MBL protein levels ( P =0.019). We focused specifically on a possible role of MBL deficiency on healing complications, based on the facts that MBL deficiency is the most common immune disorder, and that a common causality for prolonged healing of these ulcers is infection or colonization by bacteria. In our study, MBL deficiency appears to increase the risk of developing leg ulcers in SCA patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
