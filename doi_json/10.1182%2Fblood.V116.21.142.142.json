The Eph receptors represent the largest family of RTKs, which are used extensively throughout embryogenesis and development but detected in adult normal tissues. Elevated levels of expression of Eph receptors was found in a wide range of cancers and correlated with aggressive disease and metastasis. This is, triggered by a wide array of cellular responses, including cell boundary formation, motility, adhesion, and repulsion. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) is characterized by widespread involvement of the bone marrow, indicating homing and adhesion of the malignant cells to specific niches in the bone marrow, which provides a protective environment for the survival and proliferation of these cells. Direct adhesion to endothelial cells and several growth factors and cytokines secreted by endothelial cells in the BM were shown to regulate tumor proliferation. In this study we aimed to characterize the role of RTKs, specifically Eph-B2 receptor, in the interaction of WM cells with the BM microenvironment including cell adhesion, proliferation, and cell-cycle. Methods and Results: We first examined the expression and activation (phosphorylation) of different RTKs in primary WM samples and cell lines using an antibody-based RTK-array. Eph-B2 receptor was activated in all patient samples compared to control, with a 5-fold increase in CD19+ WM cells, and we further confirmed that Eph-B2 was phosphorylated in WM cell lines, BCWM.1, and in IgM secreting cell lines RL, MEC-1. We next examined the activity of Ephrin-B2/Eph-B2 on adhesion and migration of WM cells. Treating starved WM cells with recombinant ephrin-B2 (the ligand of Eph-B2) activated cell-adhesion signaling, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, p130, paxilin and cofilin, but had no effect on WM cell chemotaxis. Moreover, we found that ephrin-B2 was highly expressed on endothelial cells isolated from the BM of WM patients and on HUVEC cells. Inhibition of ephrin-B2 on the endothelial cells or Eph-B2 on the WM cells with blocking antibodies inhibited the adhesion of the WM cells to endothelial cells, as well as the cytoskeletal signaling in WM cells induced by co-culture with endothelial cells. Consequently, inhibition of the ephrin-B2/Eph-B2 interaction reversed the proliferative and cell cycle effect in WM cell which was induced by co-culture with endothelial cells. This was confirmed using BrdU proliferation assay, flow cytometry for cell cycle, and by immuno-blotting to confirm the effect on proliferative signaling pathways including PI3K kinase and cell cycle related proteins including Cyclin-D, Cyclin-E and p-Rb. Conclusion: This study examines the interaction of Eph-B2 receptor in WM and shows that ephrin- B2/Eph-B2 axis regulates adhesion, activation of downstream signaling of integrin-related molecules, survival and cell cycle progression through the interaction of tumor cells with endothelial cells. This provides the basis for further studies to explore Eph-B2 as a novel therapeutic target in WM.
