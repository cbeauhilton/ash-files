    "abstract_text": "Introduction : CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is FDA approved in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphomas. While 35-40% of patients may achieve a durable complete response (CR), the toxicity incurred with CAR-T therapy could impact the ability to receive subsequent treatment in those who progress after CAR-T infusion. Our prior data suggested that patients who experienced early progression had inferior overall survival. We now update our results and evaluate the impact of laboratory abnormalities and comorbidities at the time of progression on overall survival. Methods: Adults with large B-cell lymphomas who received CD19-specific CAR T-cells at the University of Washington/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance were included. Patients who received CAR T-cell therapy with additional concurrent protocol-specified therapy were excluded. Those who exhibited progressive disease (PD) or persistent lymphoma after CAR T-cell therapy were the focus of this study. We defined patients who progressed or received additional lymphoma directed therapy after last CAR-T cell infusion as early PD, with all other patients defined as late PD. We collected laboratory data closest to the date of progression. We defined an absolute neutrophil count < 1000, platelet count < 75K, Creatinine > upper limit of normal (ULN), INR > ULN, AST/ALT > 2.5x ULN, total bilirubin > ULN, and LDH > ULN as abnormal. Primary endpoint of this analysis was overall survival (OS) landmarked to date of progression. Secondary endpoints include sub-group analyses based on early PD as well as lab abnormalities at the time of progression. A multi-variate analysis with select baseline and progression variables was also performed. Results: We identified 66 patients who met the above criteria. Median follow up for the entire cohort is 30.4 months (range 0.1-64 months) by reverse KM method. Median time from last planned CAR infusion to progression was 43.5 days (range 11-658). Median OS of the entire cohort was 5.43 months (95% CI 3.75-12.2). 25 (38%) patients experienced early PD, which was associated with inferior OS (median 3.75 vs. 10.4 months, P=0.02). LDH > ULN at the time of progression defined a group with inferior outcomes (median OS 3.16 vs. 17.5 months, P1 indicator of hematologic and/or organ dysfunction (excluding LDH) at the time of progression had worse outcomes compared to those with one or fewer abnormalities (median OS 1.74 vs. 7.14 months, P=0.001). Multivariate analysis identified pre-CAR IPI score 4-5 (HR 6.33, 95% CI 1.97-20.36), LDH > ULN at progression (7.01, 95% CI 2.89-17.013), and abnormal creatinine at progression (5.32, 95% CI 1.71-16.53), as factors associated with increased risk of death. Conclusions: Patients with PD post CD19-specific CAR T-cell therapy, particularly those with early PD, elevated LDH, or renal failure experience extremely poor outcomes. These data can inform discussion of prognosis for patients who progress after CAR T-cell therapy and may predict which patients may benefit from additional anti-lymphoma therapy.
