    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2490 Acute monocytic leukemia, the M5 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M5), is a distinct group with characteristic clinical features and has been reported to have a poor prognosis. A subset of AML-M5 is associated with various chromosomal translocations involving the MLL locus at 11q23, while mutations are also reported in genes such as NPM1 , FLT3 , NRAS at different frequencies in this disease. However, these genetic changes occur only in a part of AML-M5 patients and some of them lack specificity due to the presence in other AML subtypes. To address the important genetic and molecular factors for the pathogenesis of M5 in a comprehensive manner, we sequenced exomes from nine AML-M5 initial bone marrow (BM) samples and matched control samples. We identified 64 somatic mutations within the coding sequences of 61 genes including 57 point mutations and 7 insertions or deletions (indels), among which 17 genes had at least 2 cases of mutations in 100 validated AML-M5 BM samples. We tested a part of these gene mutations in different subtypes of AML and found that some mutations are restricted to AML-M5 and AML-M4 (acute myelomonocytic leukemia) with more than 15% and 10% frequency, respectively. Thus, by systemic sequencing of exomes from a group of AML-M5 cases, we discovered recurring mutations that may play an essential role in the pathogenesis of AML with monocytic features.The prognostic significance of the mutations will be present in details.
