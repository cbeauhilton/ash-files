    "abstract_text": "DLBCL is a curable subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, although a significant number of patients do not achieve a remission or they relapse with conventional chemotherapy. While clinical variables (e.g., IPI), tumor (somatic) genetic alterations, and gene expression profiling have all been shown to predict outcome, there remains a need for additional prognostic biomarkers. One understudied class of biomarkers is host genetic background. We evaluated the hypothesis that germline variability in 73 SNPs from 44 candidate immune genes was associated with overall survival in DLBCL. We addressed this hypothesis in 365 DLBCL patients aged 20\u201370 years who participated in a population-based case-control study conducted from 1998\u20132000 (prior to the use of R-CHOP) through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registries in Detroit, Seattle, Iowa, and Los Angeles. Germline DNA was extracted from a venous blood sample or mouthwash buccal cell sample, which was collected a median of 4.8 months after diagnosis in this population-based study. All genotyping was conducted at the National Cancer Institute Core Genotyping Facility using the Taqman platform, and was successful in over 95% of the DNA samples for the SNPs evaluated. Histology, stage, presence of B-symptoms, first course of therapy, date of last follow-up, and vital status were derived from linkage to registry databases at each study site in the spring of 2005. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to evaluate the association between individual SNPs, adjusted for age, demographic and clinical factors. Parallel modeling strategies were used to identify the best summary multi-SNP risk score to predict survival. At a median follow-up of 56 months (range, 27-78 months) for surviving patients, there were 96 deaths in 365 patients (26%). In multivariate modeling, SNPs in IL1A (rs1800587; HR CT/TT =1.90, 1.26\u20132.87), IL6 (rs1800795; HR GG =1.48, 0.99\u20132.23), IL-10 (rs1800896; HR AG/GG =1.48, 0.91\u20132.38), and IFNGR2 (rs2070385; HR AG/GG =1.35, 0.86\u20132.11) were the strongest and most robust predictors of overall survival. A summary score of the number of deleterious genotypes from these four genes in combination with clinical and demographic variables was strongly associated with survival ( p =9.3 x 10 \u221212 ); Kaplan-Meier 5-year survival estimates for low, intermediate, and high risk patients were 89%, 68%, and 47% respectively. In conclusion, host genetic background as measured by germline polymorphisms in immune genes including IL1A , IL6 , IL10 , and IFNGR2 were associated with overall survival in DLBCL after accounting for clinical and demographic factors. These promising results require confirmation and need further evaluation in patients treated with R-CHOP in conjunction with tumor and other prognostic biomarkers.",
