    "abstract_text": "Abstract 647 The mammalian \u03b2-globin locus is under the coordinated control of multiple transcription factors to ensure the correct expression of the globin genes during development. The distal \u03b2-globin locus control region (LCR) physically interacts with \u03b2-like globin promoters to form developmentally dynamic chromatin loops. The hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 and its associated cofactor Ldb1 bind to the LCR and the \u03b2-globin promoter and are essential for loop formation and \u03b2-globin expression. However, the molecular basis of chromatin looping and its cause-effect relationship with transcriptional activation are unclear. Here, we examined whether Ldb1 is an effector of GATA-1 during loop formation. Specifically, we tested whether artificial tethering of Ldb1 to the endogenous \u03b2-globin promoter and LCR can substitute for GATA-1 function. Ldb1 was fused to artificial zinc finger proteins (ZFP) designed to bind to the LCR and \u03b2-globin promoter. Ldb1-ZFPs were introduced pairwise into murine GATA-1 null erythroid cells in which the \u03b2-globin locus is relaxed and transcriptionally silent. In vivo binding of the Ldb1-ZFPs to their targets was verified by ChIP assay. Strikingly, expression of Ldb1-ZFPs but not Ldb1 or ZFPs alone led to substantial activation of \u03b2-globin transcription in the absence of GATA-1. Moreover, chromosome conformation capture experiments showed that Ldb1-ZFPs triggered physical association between the LCR and the \u03b2-globin promoter. Recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and its phosphorylation at serine 5 are critical LCR-dependent regulatory steps in \u03b2-globin transcription. We found that Ldb1-ZFP expression facilitated Pol II recruitment at the \u03b2-globin promoter and serine 5 phosphorylation to the same level as GATA-1-expressing erythroid cells. This is consistent with an Ldb1-ZFP-induced LCR-\u03b2-globin promoter chromatin loop. In concert, these results indicate that Ldb1 is a critical effector for GATA-1 by mediating enhancer-promoter loops. In broader terms, our results suggest that chromatin loop formation can be sufficient for gene activation in the absence of an essential transcription factor. We are currently in the process of examining whether targeting of the LCR to embryonic and fetal globin genes can be used to activate them in adult cells. Targeted chromatin loop formation may provide a method to activate fetal or adult hemoglobin expression in individuals with \u03b2-thalassemia or sickle cell anemia.
