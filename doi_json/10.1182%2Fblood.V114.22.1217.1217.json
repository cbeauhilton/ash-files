However, it is not curative and virtually all patients will ultimately relapse. As more options are available to treat relapsed disease, the role of a second ASCT as salvage therapy is unclear. Method Retrospective review of all MM pts who received a 2 nd ASCT as salvage therapy at Princess Margaret Hospital. Results Between February 1997 and July 2009, 79 MM pts received a second ASCT for relapsed MM at our institution. Median age was 60 yrs (range 39-72) at second transplant. 48 pts (61%) were male. Immunoglobulin subtype included IgG (42), IgA (21), light chain (11), nonsecretory (3), IgM(1) and IgD (1). Transplant conditioning regimen for first transplant was high dose melphalan (MEL) 140-200 mg/m 2 in 67, busulphan and cyclophosphamide in 1, and combinations of MEL with etoposide (E) or TBI in the rest. 2 nd ASCT conditioning consisted of MEL alone in 76, the remaining 3 had MEL with either TBI or E. The median time to relapse after the first transplant was 2.72 years (0.81-8.26), with a median interval between transplants of 3.61 years (1.63-9.59). Response to first transplant in 78 evaluable patients was 13 CR/nCR (17%), 56 PR/VGPR (72%), 9 MR/SD (12%). Nineteen pts received maintenance therapy between transplants. Two transplant-related deaths occurred following 2 nd ASCT. In 73 evaluable patients, response to second transplant was 11 CR/nCR (15%), 57 PR (78%), 6 MR/SD (8%). After 2 nd ASCT, with median follow up 5.92 years (71 months), median progression-free survival (PFS) was 18.5 months and median overall survival (OS) was 4.4 years. Long term progression-free status based on the progression-free interval after 1 st ASCT is summarized Table 1 . PFS based on progression free interval after 1 st ASCT is outlined in Figure 1 . Conclusions 2 nd ASCT is a feasible and safe salvage therapy in relapsed MM patients. It is effective in providing a median progression free survival of 18.5 months and median overall survival of 4.4 years (52.8 months) after 2 nd ASCT. This is comparable if not better than modern salvage chemotherapies. The longer the disease free interval after 1 st ASCT the more effective 2nd ASCT is at extending both progression free survival and overall survival. It is reasonable, therefore, to consider a 2 nd ASCT if the time to progression is greater than 2 years after first ASCT.
