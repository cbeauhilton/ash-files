    "abstract_text": "Uproleselan (GMI-1271) is a novel antagonist of E-selectin, an adhesion molecule expressed on endothelial cells. E-selectin is expressed transiently in the normal vasculature during an inflammatory response and constitutively in the bone marrow (BM). Binding of E-selectin (E-sel) to sialyl Le x , the E-sel ligand (E-sel-L), on the leukemic cell surface activates cell survival pathways and promotes chemotherapy resistance in AML. In preclinical models, blockade of E-selectin with uproleselan disrupts the activation of cell survival pathways and enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy across multiple AML tumor models. Furthermore, uproleselan protected against chemotherapy-induced mucositis by regulating macrophage trafficking to the site of injury in the gut lining. A previous phase I/II study of uproleselan added to chemotherapy in patients with untreated AML (older adults \u226560 yrs) and relapsed/refractory AML (\u2265 18yrs) showed promising remission rates (CR/CRi) and survival outcomes, and reduced rates of mucositis. In the newly diagnosed older patients, high remission rates were achieved overall (CR/CRi 72%) and for the high risk subgroup with sAML (CR/CRi 69%). In this phase 2/3 study, we will test the addition of uproleselan to a standard daunorubicin/cytarabine regimen in older adults with previously untreated AML. The study will enroll patients age \u2265 60 yrs with untreated acute myeloid leukemia. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, activating mutations in FLT3, or evidence of central nervous system involvement are excluded. Subjects are randomized to 7+3 induction (cytarabine + daunorubicin) +/- uproleselan. Subjects achieving a CR/CRi may receive up to 3 cycles of consolidation with intermediate dose cytarabine 2 gm/m 2 IV d1-5 +/- uproleselan. The primary phase II objective is to compare the event-free survival (EFS). A sample size of 262 patients was selected for the phase II to detect an improvement in median EFS from 7 months to 11 months (HR= 0.64) with > 95% power, using a log rank test. The phase III primary objective will compare overall survival (OS). For the phase III, a sample size of 335 evaluable patients per arm (670 total inclusive of patients enrolled in phase II) will provide >90% power to detect an improvement in median OS from 12 months to 16 months (HR= 0.75), using a log-rank test. Correlative studies will measure E-selectin ligand on AML blasts and soluble E-selectin and will also measure minimal residual disease after remission induction by multiparameter flow cytometry. A comprehensive geriatric assessment will identify baseline measures associated with EFS and develop a risk model to predict OS among older adults receiving intensive AML therapy. The study is endorsed by SWOG and ECOG-ACRIN and opened to enrollment on 1/16/2019.
