    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1535 Background: Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a disease which largely affects older adults, for whom optimal therapy is unclear. Evidence-based strategies to identify those older adults who may tolerate and benefit from standard therapies are lacking. Objective: Evaluate the predictive value of bedside geriatric assessment (GA) on overall survival (OS) for older adults receiving induction therapy for AML. Methods: Ongoing prospective study of patients \u226560 years of age with newly diagnosed AML and planned induction chemotherapy admitted to Wake Forest University. Bedside GA was performed during inpatient work-up for AML. GA measures included the Modified Mini-Mental Status Exam (3MS), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Distress thermometer, Pepper Assessment Tool for Disability ([PAT-D], includes self- reported activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and mobility questions), Short Physical Performance Battery ([SPPB], includes timed 4-meter walk, chair stands, standing balance), and grip strength. Cox proportional hazards models were fit for each GA measure as a predictor of OS, controlling for age, gender, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) score, and cytogenetic risk group. The median follow-up was 4.7 months. Results: Among 53 consecutive patients the mean age was 69 (SD 11.5) years, 59.3% were female, and 46.3% had significant comorbidity (HCT-CI score >1). The majority had intermediate (72.6%) or poor risk (23.6%) cytogenetics. Approximately two thirds (64.7%) received standard induction therapy with anthracycline, cytarabine \u00b1 etoposide. Mean baseline GA scores included: 3MS 82.4 (SD 9.6), CES-D 13.5 (SD 11.3), Distress 4.2 (SD 3.3), PAT-D 1.6 (SD 0.6), SPPB 6.4 (SD 4.2), grip strength 32.0 kilograms (SD 8.5). In adjusted analyses, better performance on the cognitive screen (3MS) was associated with improved OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89\u20130.99). There was a trend towards worse OS among individuals who screened positive for depression at baseline (CES-D>16) (HR 2.3, 95% CI 0.75\u20136.80) and among those with a slower gait speed (< 1 meter/second) (HR 5.9, 95% CI 0.80\u201345.3). Additional baseline GA measures were not associated with OS in this analysis. Conclusions: Geriatric assessment measures may independently predict OS among older adults receiving induction therapy for AML. If validated in future studies, these screening measures may improve risk stratification and inform interventions to improve outcomes for older adults with AML.
