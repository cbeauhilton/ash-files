    "abstract_text": "Non-coding RNAs have long been viewed as non-functional genomic relicts of evolution, but recetn findings have implicated their importance in physiology and disease. Recently, in vitro experiments demonstrated that the pseudogenes of PTEN and KRAS operate as natural miRNA decoys (competitive endogenous RNAs or ceRNAs) that regulate the expression of their parental genes. However, in vivo evidence for a causal role of pseudogenes in cancer development is lacking. To investigate whether the BRAF pseudogene (BRAFps) possesses oncogenic properties we generated transgenic mice carrying a Tet-inducible BRAF pseudogene allele. Global BRAFps overexpression resulted in the development of aggressive B-cell lymphoma after 6-12 months. These tumors were characterized by a profound expansion of B-lymphocytes in the spleen, as well as splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and infiltration of the kidneys, lungs, and liver by neoplastic cells. The BRAFps-induced lymphoma was polyclonal, transplantable, dependent on continuous BRAFps expression, and cooperated with heterozygous loss of PTEN to accelerate disease onset. Mechanistically, we propose that BRAFps functions as a ceRNA that sequesters miRNAs from BRAF and possibly other targets. Indeed, overexpression of BRAFps results in elevated levels of BRAF in a Dicer-dependent manner. This, in turn, increased BRAF-dependent MAPK signaling and proliferation. To further validate the ceRNA activity of BRAFps, we engineered mice to express only the 3\u2019UTR or CDS of BRAFps as each portion of the pseudogene may individually engage in miRNA-mediated crosstalk with BRAF. Notably, both BRAFps-CDS and BRAFps-3\u2019UTR increased spleen and lymph node weights 6 months after induction. Interestingly, BRAFps-3\u2019UTR elicited a lymphoma phenotype similar to full length BRAFps, while mice expressing BRAFps-CDS developed a more indolent form of this phenotype, suggesting that lymphomagenesis is primarily mediated by the BRAFps 3\u2019UTR. BRAFps transcript was undetectable in primary human B-cells, but was aberrantly expressed in primary human DLBCL and human DLBCL cell lines. Expression of BRAF and BRAFps was positively correlated in human primary DLBCL and human DLBCL cell lines. In addition, gains or amplifications of the genomic locus containing BRAFps were found in various human cancer types. Overexpression of BRAFps in human lymphoma cells elevated BRAF levels, MAPK activation, proliferation and growth in xenografts. Our results demonstrate for the first time the oncogenic potential of a pseudogene in an engineered mouse model and indicate that ceRNA- mediated regulation is an important regulatory mechanism of gene expression in vivo.
