    "abstract_text": "112 patients with senile acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), refractory or relapsed AML, and MDS-RAEBt entered this study to receive aclarubicin and low dose Arabinoside Cytosine (Ara-C) in combination with Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) for evaluation of efficacy and tolerance of this CGA regimen. Low dose Ara-C was given at the dosage of 10mg/m 2 /12h, subcutaneously, D1-14 and aclarubicin 14mg/m 2 /d, intravenously, D1-4 (regimen A) or 7mg/m 2 D1-8 (regimen B). Recombinant G-CSF was given at the dosage of 200\u03bcg/m 2 /d, subcutaneously, D1-14. We proved that overall response rate was 19/26 (73.1%) in senile AML, 48/62 (77.4%) in refractory AML, 12/18 (66.7%) in relapsed AML and 10/13 (76.9%) in MDS-RAEBt; and CR rate was at 8/26 (30.8%) in senile patients, 30/62 (48.4%) in refractory AML, 8/18 (44.4%) in relapsed AML and 5/13 (38.5%) in MDS-RAEBt, which were comparable in four groups of patients. 52 patients were followed up. Median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 9.0\u00b12.2 months and 11.0\u00b11.6 months, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimated PFS and OS rate at 12 months were 40.73\u00b18.15% and 42.85\u00b18.23%, respectively. 1 year OS and PFS rate of the patients with CR were 60%\u00b110.8% and 51.3%\u00b113.7%, respectively, compared with the patients with PR, 17.7%\u00b19.3% and 6.4%\u00b16.1%, respectively. The toxic effects were very rare, mainly manifested as hematological changes, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia due to myelosuppression, which was around 70\u201380% exceeding NCI grade II. And non-hematological toxicities were not observed in this study. CAG regimen seems to be promising for the treatment of various categories of poor-prognosis AML or MDS-RAEBt, with acceptable toxicity.",
