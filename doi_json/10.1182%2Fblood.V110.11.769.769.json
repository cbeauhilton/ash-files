    "abstract_text": "Retrospective studies suggest that rapid lymphocyte recovery following autologous stem cell transplants (SCT) may be associated with better outcomes. Previously we showed that adoptive transfer of in-vivo vaccine-primed and ex-vivo (anti-CD3/anti-CD28) costimulated autologous T cells (ex-T) at about day 14 post-transplant increased CD4 and CD8 T cell counts at day 42 post-transplant and induced pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-directed T and B-cell responses [Rapoport et al, Nature Medicine, 2005]. In 2 current studies, we are further investigating the impact of ex-vivo costimulated autologous T cells on vaccine responses after SCT. In the first study, we are investigating whether a similar strategy of pre- and post-transplant immunizations along with an early infusion of vaccine-primed ex-T can induce responses to a putative tumor vaccine composed of 4 HLA-A2-restricted peptides derived from survivin and hTERT in pts undergoing SCT for myeloma. In the second (randomized) trial, the impact of early ex-T on immune recovery and vaccine reponses is being tested in pediatric neuroblastoma pts. Compared to the previous study, two methodologic changes were made: The target number of T cells infused was raised 5-fold to 5 x 10 10 (10 9 /kg) T cells were infused on day + 2 to take greater advantage of homeostatic expansion mechanisms. Patients were monitored for delayed hematopoietic recovery because of this switch to early ex-T and the fact that survivin and hTERT are also expressed in hematopoietic stem cells. At the time of submission, 16 adult and 30 pediatric patients have been enrolled on these trials of whom 11 and 21, respectively, are evaluable for post-transplant hematopoietic and T-cell recovery. On the myeloma trial, the mean # of T cells infused was 3.95 x 10 10 with 96% viability and a CD4/CD8 ratio of 1.8:1. At day 14 post-transplant, the median CD4 count was 1951/mcl (range 651\u20137668) and the median CD8 count was 4117/mcl (range 1499\u201339,354). The median # days to achieve an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 500 was 12 (range 11\u201314) and the median # days to achieve a PLT count >20,000/mcl was 13 days (range 0\u201328). Similarly, in the pediatric cohort, median CD4 and CD8 counts at day 30 were 1500 and 2100/mcl, respectively, compared to 22 and 14 in a group of pts who did not receive d+2 ex-T, with no impact on engraftment. 1 adult and 3 pediatric pts also developed an \u201cengraftment syndrome\u201d characterized by GHVD-like features with or without fever. The adult pt with day 14 CD4 and CD8 counts of 2,724 and 11,571 cells/mcl had clinical and histologic features of (autologous) gut GVHD. 3 pediatric pts developed pruritic rashes clinically and pathologically indistiguishable from GVHD within 14 d of ex-T infusion, with fever seen in 1. In the adult and 1 pediatric pt, steroid treatment led to complete resolution of symptoms. These combined data sets demonstrate that robust CD4 and CD8 T cells counts can be achieved as early as day 14 post-SCT when adults or children receive ex-T at day +2 post-SCT without exogenous IL-2 or other cytokine support. It appears that a subset of patients develop a T cell \u201cengraftment syndrome\u201d similar to autologous GVHD. The mechanisms responsible for this rapid immune cell recovery are currently under investigation."
