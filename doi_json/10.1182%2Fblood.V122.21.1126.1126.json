    "abstract_text": "Background Acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is associated with leg pain and discomfort. Elastic compression stockings (ECS) have the potential to improve DVT-related leg pain by reducing the diameter of distended veins, increasing venous blood flow and reducing venous hypertension. To date, however, the effect of ECS on DVT-related leg pain has not been studied. In the SOX Trial, a randomized trial of active ECS vs. placebo ECS to prevent the post-thrombotic syndrome, we measured leg pain intensity at baseline and at several time-points during follow-up. Objective In a secondary, non-prespecified analysis of the SOX Trial, to determine whether active ECS, compared with placebo (sham) stockings, are effective to reduce leg pain associated with acute proximal DVT. Methods We did a multicenter (24 centres in Canada and U.S.) randomized placebo controlled trial of active ECS vs. placebo ECS after a first, symptomatic proximal DVT. Active ECS were knee length, 30-40 mm Hg (Class II) graduated ECS. Placebo ECS were manufactured to appear identical to active ECS but lacked therapeutic compression. Study stockings were worn on the DVT-affected leg daily and continued for up to 2 years. Exclusion criteria were >10 days since DVT diagnosis, not planned to be treated with anticoagulants, known peripheral arterial disease or limb phlegmasia, anticipated lifespan < 6 months, inability of patient or caregiver to apply ECS, thrombolysis to treat DVT, geographically inaccessible for follow-up visits or unable to give informed consent. Leg pain intensity was assessed on a 10-point Visual Analog Scale (0, no pain; 10, worst possible pain) via patient self-report at baseline, 14 days, 1 month and 60 days after randomization. We compared mean pain scores at each time point in the active ECS vs. placebo ECS groups using t-tests. We repeated this analysis, restricted to patients who reported daily stockings use at the 1 month visit (the first visit at which frequency of stocking use was assessed). We conducted pre-specified subgroup analyses by age, sex, and extent of DVT. Results are presented as mean difference (95% confidence interval [CI]) in pain intensity score between groups. All statistical tests were 2-sided and significance was set at P<0.05. Results 410 patients were randomized to active ECS and 396 to placebo ECS. One and 2 patients, respectively, were found to be ineligible soon after randomization and excluded from the analysis. Mean time from DVT diagnosis to randomization was 4.7 days. Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups (60% male, mean age 55.1 years, highest proximal extent of DVT was iliac or femoral vein in 70% and popliteal vein in 30%, 87% were out-patients). Pain scores diminished over time in both groups. There were no differences between groups in pain scores at any time-point ( Table ), and no evidence for subgroup interaction by age category, sex or anatomical extent of DVT (not shown).

As our first follow-up assessment was 14 days after DVT, we were unable to evaluate if active ECS had a beneficial or detrimental effect on pain scores during the first 2 weeks after DVT.
