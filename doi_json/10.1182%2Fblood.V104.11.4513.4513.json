    "abstract_text": "Background: Although complete remission rates for AML are near 70% with combination induction and consolidation chemotherapy, most patients will relapse and die from the disease or treatment complications. New agents with unique mechanisms are needed. One such class of therapeutics are fusion proteins consisting of protein synthesis inactivating peptide toxins fused to tumor cell selective ligands. DT388-IL3 is one such fusion protein. Rationale: In preclinical studies, DT388-IL3 was cytotoxic to the IL3 receptor expressing leukemia cell lines but not toxic to IL3 receptor negative cell lines. This agent was less toxic to normal progenitors and not toxic to early hematopoietic stem cells. The majority of AML progenitors overexpress IL3 receptors. Animal model work in mice bearing human leukemia cells has demonstrated anti-leukemia efficacy which is dose dependent with this agent. Toxicities in monkeys include vascular leak syndrome and pancytopenia observed only at the highest doses. The MTD in monkeys was estimated at 60mcg/kg/day. We report preliminary data on the use of DT388-IL3 fusion protein in humans from an ongoing phase I trial. Pharmacokinetics; clinical and immune response to this novel fusion protein are also being followed. Patients and Methods: Patients with refractory AML were eligible. The first dose level was qd M-W-F X six doses of DT388-IL3 at 4mcg/kg/day with dose escalation planned for subsequent patients. Patients with progression of disease or unacceptable study drug toxicity were to be removed from the study. Toxicity was graded according to NCI CTCAE version 3.0. Three patients have been treated with DT388-IL3. Serum samples were collected and will be assayed for anti-DT388-IL3 antibodies prior to and after treatment. Blood samples were obtained to measure circulating levels of active DT388-IL3 and its half life. Patient blasts were also collected prior to treatment for later analysis of expression of IL3 receptors. Result: Two patients tolerated the treatment schedule(of six doses) without any significant toxicities. Mild fever, headaches, nausea were noted. Both of these patients had progression of disease-one during treatment and one on day 15 bone marrow biospy. The above mentioned patients died secondary to disease complications at 2 weeks and 18 weeks after their last dose of the study agent respectively. DT388-IL3 levels on these two patients post infusion were below the the reliable detectable limits of the assay. The third patient became febrile and hypotensive after the first dose. The hypotension persisted and she did not receive any further doses. This patient is alive 5 weeks later with supportive care alone. DT388-IL3 levels following this patient\u2019s dose are as follows: 2min post infusion 34.3ng/ml, 30min post infusion 1.9ng/ml, 60min post infusion 0.075ng/ml, 120min post infusion 0.003ng/ml, 240min post infusion undetectable. Conclusion: Preclinical/animal studies suggest that DT388-IL3 has anti-leukemia efficacy. Preliminary data from our ongoing phase I trial reveals minimal study agent related toxicity and no life threatening complications at this first dose level. Dose escalation is planned as per protocol.",
