    "abstract_text": "Background: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of heterogeneous disorders of hematopoietic stem cells, characterized by defective hematopoiesis and dysplasia of multiple blood lineages. Patients with MDS could achieve complete remission only by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, because of its high mortality and morbidity, long-term survival is accomplished only in the half of the patients, underscoring the importance of accurate prognostication before the therapeutic choice. For this purpose, several systems, such as the International Prognostic Scoring System, are being successfully applied to predicting patients' clinical outcomes. Advanced molecular diagnostics of recent years might further improve the prediction. Nevertheless, originally established based on the data from patients who are untreated or only supportively treated, existing systems may not always be applied properly to the prediction of outcomes of the patients who are treated by HSCT. Methods: We enrolled 790 patients with MDS who were treated by unrelated bone marrow transplantation between 2006 and 2013 through the Japan Marrow Donor Program. Oncogenic variants and copy number alterations were identified by targeted-capture sequencing of peripheral blood-derived DNA using RNA baits designed for 69 known or putative driver genes in myeloid neoplasms and 1,674 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Results: The median age at HSCT and observation period were 51 years old (16-66) and 1106 days (48-6018), respectively. At the time of transplant, 29%, 34%, 24%, and 5.2% of the cases were diagnosed as low-risk MDS, high-risk MDS, secondary acute myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic / myeloproliferative neoplasms, respectively, while the disease subtype was unknown for the remaining 8.2% of the cases. Mutations were observed in 73% of the patients, where U2AF1 was most frequently mutated (13.8%), followed by RUNX1 (12.9%), ASXL1 (12.8%), TP53 (12.4%), and NRAS (7.1%). The mean number of mutations was 2.0 per patient with a mean allelic burden of 43.8%. Sequencing data were successfully used for sensitive detection of CNVs and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) (or uniparental disomy; UPD). Among the most frequent lesions were 7q LOH, complex karyotype-like CNVs as defined by 3 or more CNVs excluding UPD in targeted sequencing), 5q LOH, trisomy 8, and 17p LOH, observed in 15.5%, 12.9%, 10.1%, 7.0%, and 6.8% of the patients, respectively. Mutations in TP53 , CBL , and EZH2 significantly co-occurred with LOH in 17p, 11q, and 7q, with odds ratios of 190, 75.5, and 11.7, respectively. On the basis of these findings, we combined frequently identified LOH lesions with associated mutations for further analyses of survival. In univariate analysis of overall survival (OS), 9 lesions were significantly associated with shorter OS; TP53 mutation and/or 17p LOH ( TP53 / 17p LOH) (HR 2.76, P = 1.6 x 10 -14 ), CSNK1A1 / 5q LOH (HR 2.66, P = 2.13 x 10 -12 ), CBL / 11q LOH (HR 2.42, P = 3.88 x 10 -7 ), EZH2 / 7q LOH (HR 2.29, P = 1.46 x 10 -12 ), NRAS mutations (HR 1.86, P = 2.0 x10 -4 ), ETV6 / 12p LOH (HR 1.83, P = 2.84 x 10 -5 ), 1q gain (HR 1.73, P = 0.0037), 20p LOH (HR 1.57, P = 0.030), and FLT3 mutations (HR 1.53, P = 0.027). The number of these unfavorable lesions significantly correlated with OS (P=8.9 x 10 -16 ). Specifically, those with at least one mutation showed a significantly shorter OS, compared to those with none of these mutations (HR 2.54, P<2.0 x 10 -16 ). TP53 / 17p LOH was the most unfavorable among the 9 lesions by multivariate analysis (HR 1.97, P=1.6 x 10 -14 ). Multivariate analysis with clinical factors revealed that the presence of at least 1 of the 9 lesions was independently associated with poor OS (HR 2.05, P<2.0 x 10 -16 ), together with well-known clinical factors negatively affecting OS, including red blood cell transfusion before HSCT (HR 1.93, P=0.0036), 3 or more grade of the performance status at HSCT (HR 1.92, P=1.6 x 10 -4 ), and older age (HR 1.69, P=2.0 x 10 -4 ). The presence of at least one lesion negatively affected OS irrespective of the presence of complex karyotype-like CNVs. Conclusions: The present study highlights the clinical significance of somatic mutations and CNVs in MDS cases treated by HSCT. Our findings suggest that the novel set of lesions identified in this study could be successfully used for the prediction of outcome in MDS in the setting of stem cell transplantation.
