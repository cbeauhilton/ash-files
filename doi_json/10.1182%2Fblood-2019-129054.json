    "abstract_text": "Hematopoiesis is tightly regulated by a network of transcription factors and complexes that are required for the maintenance and development of HSCs. In a screen for epigenetic regulators of hematopoiesis in zebrafish, we identified a requirement of the tumor suppressor protein, Ing4, in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) specification. Though the Ing4 mechanism of action remains poorly characterized, it has been shown to promote stem-like cell characteristics in malignant cells and is a frequent target of inactivation in various cancer types. The tumor suppressive activity is, in part, due to the inhibitory role of Ing4 in the NF-kB signaling pathway. In zebrafish, loss of Ing4 results in loss of HSC specification and a significant increase in NF-kB target gene expression. Knockdown of NF-kB expression in Ing4 deficient zebrafish recovered HSC marker expression in the aorta suggesting that NF-kB inhibition could remediate the loss of Ing4 expression. Small molecule NF-kB pathway inhibitors with varying mechanisms were also observed to rescue of HSC marker staining in the zebrafish aorta. Ing4 deficient embryos incubated with a lower dose of inhibitor had a 31% recovery of marker staining and 82% of embryos incubated in the highest dose recovered HSC marker staining emphasizing a dose dependent rescue of HSC specification through NF-kB suppression. As in the zebrafish, we have identified a requirement for Ing4 in murine hematopoiesis. Ing4-/- bone marrow has aberrant hematopoiesis resulting in an increase in the number of short term-HSCs (ST-HSCs) (11.4% vs 31.7%) and a dramatic decrease in multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs) (47.9% vs 19.3%) along with a concurrent modest increase in the population of long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) (2.4% vs 5.5%). Analysis of differentiation in Ing4 null bone marrow also reveals skewed hematopoiesis. We see a 14% increase in granulocytes in the null mouse marrow and observe similar skewing in CFU assays. Additionally, there were alterations in stress hematopoiesis following hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Sorted LT-HSCs fail to engraft, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved requirement for Ing4 in HSCs. Surprisingly, competitive transplantation assay with Ing4-defecient MPPs versus wild-type showed dramatic increase in peripheral blood multilineage chimerism up to 9 months post-transplantation (19% vs. 59%). This lends to the hypothesis that Ing4 deficient MPPs gain self-renewal capabilities. In further characterization of these cells, we found an increase in MPPs that express lower levels of CD34 (55.5% vs 67.7%). CD34 expression is a marker of HSCs. This CD34 +/mid population also express CD229 (85% positive), which is barely detectable in wildtype marrow (less that 0.01%). CD229 is also an HSC marker. Based on these exciting findings, we hypothesize that we have identified a subset of CD34 +/mid CD229 + MPPs in Ing4 deficient mice that retain self-renewal characteristics. Our data suggest that Ing4 normally functions as a critical suppressor for genes required for self-renewal and developmental potency in MPPs. Overall, our findings suggest that Ing4 plays a crucial role in the regulation of hematopoiesis and provides key tools for further identification and characterization of Ing4 pathways and functions. Given the role of Ing4 in both normal hematopoiesis and cancer, this gene likely has a critical role in regulation of stem cell self-renewal and maintenance.
