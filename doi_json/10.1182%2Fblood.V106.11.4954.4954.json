    "abstract_text": "Aim of the study: Evaluation of significance of investigation of Ki67 and AgNOR staining as an indices of proliferative activity of megakaryocytes. Material and methods: Bone marrow smears from 151 patients suffering from hematological malignancies: polycythemia vera (PV) \u2212 14 cases, myelofibrosis (MF) \u2212 14, essential thrombocythemia (ET) \u2212 15, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) \u2212 11, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) \u2212 18; acute myeloid leukemia (AML) \u2212 30, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) \u2212 10, low grade non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas (NHL) with bone marrow infiltration \u2212 20, multiple myeloma (MM) \u2212 19. Cytological slides were stored in the room temperature more than 24 hours and then stained using immunocytochemical method for Ki67 and cytochemical method for AgNOR. Slides were analyzed using illuminating microscope with digital image analysis (software LUCIA). Mean particles area, mean nuclear area and maturity of nucleus in AgNOR staining as well as intensity of Ki67 expression were evaluated, according to arbitrary scale (strong, medium, light, no reaction). Results: Look at the table 1 and table 2. Conclusions:There is a good correlation between expression of Ki-67 and AgNOR\u2019s in megakaryocytes as well as between nuclear maturity and indices of Ki-67 and AgNOR in myeloproliferative disorders. Differences in AgNOR\u2019s and Ki 67 staining area between myeloproliferative diseases and another hematological malignancies are also significant.
