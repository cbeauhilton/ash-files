    "abstract_text": "Abstract 893 ARC (Apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain) is a unique antiapoptotic protein that has been shown to suppress the activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis. We previously reported that ARC is one of the most potent adverse prognostic factors in AML and that high ARC protein expression predicted shorter survival and poor clinical outcome in patients with AML (Carter BZ et al., Blood 2011). Here we report how ARC is regulated and its role in inhibition of AML apoptosis and in cell survival. We provide evidence that ARC expression is regulated by MAPK and PI3K signaling. Inhibition of MAPK and PI3K pathways decreased ARC mRNA and protein levels in AML cells. ARC expression in AML cells is upregulated in co-cultures with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and the upregulation is suppressed in the presence of MAPK or PI3K inhibitors. To investigate the role of ARC in apoptosis resistance in AML, we generated stable ARC overexpressing (O/E) KG-1 and stable ARC knock down (K/D) OCI-AML3 and Molm13 cells and treated them with Ara-C and agents selectively inducing intrinsic (ABT-737) or extrinsic (TRAIL) apoptosis. We found that ARC O/E cells are more resistant and ARC K/D cells more sensitive to Ara-C, ABT-737, and TRAIL-induced apoptosis: EC 50 s of Ara-C, ABT-737, or TRAIL treatment at 48 hours for ARC O/E KG-1 and control cells were 1.5 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM vs. 83.5 \u00b1 4.6 nM, 2.2 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM vs. 60.2 \u00b1 3.1 nM, or 0.97 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcg/mL vs. 0.17 \u00b1 0.08 \u03bcg/mL, respectively and for ARC K/D OCI-AML3 and control cells were 0.33 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcM vs. 3.4 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM, 0.24 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcM vs. 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM, or 0.13 \u00b1 0.09 \u03bcg/mL vs. 0.36 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Bone marrow microenvironment is known to play critical roles in AML disease progression and in protecting leukemia cells from various therapeutic agent-induced apoptosis. Leukemia cells were co-cultured with MSCs in vitro study to mimic the in vivo condition. ARC was found to be highly expressed in MSCs and stable ARC K/D MSCs were generated. AML cell lines and primary patient samples were co-cultured with ARC K/D or control MSCs and treated with Ara-C, ABT-737, or TRAIL. Interestingly, ARC K/D MSCs lost their protective activity for leukemia cells treated with these agents. EC 50 s for OCI-AML3 cells co-cultured with ARC K/D or control MSCs for 48 hours treated with Ara-C, ABT-737, or TRAIL were 1.0 \u00b1 0.04 \u03bcM vs. 4.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM, 0.15 \u00b1 0.06 \u03bcM vs. 0.53 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcM, or 1.4 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcg/mL vs. 8.1 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. In addition, ARC O/E KG-1 cells grew faster and ARC K/D OCI-AML3 and Molm13 cells and ARC K/D MSCs grew slower than their respective controls. We then injected KG-1 cells into mice and found that NOD-SCID mice harboring ARC O/E KG-1 had significantly shorter survival than mice injected with the vector control KG-1 (median 84 vs. 111 days) as shown in the figure.

ARC is regulated by MSCs through various signaling pathways in AML cells, protects leukemia cells from apoptosis induced by chemotherapy and by agents selectively inducing intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis. ARC regulates leukemia cell growth in vitro and in vivo . The results suggest that ARC is a potential target for AML therapy. In addition, targeting ARC in MSCs suppresses microenvironmental protection of AML cells. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
