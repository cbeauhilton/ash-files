    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4226 There has been reluctance to collect apheresis HPC grafts from donors of age 60 and beyond. This is predicated on concern over relative frailty, poor venous access, reduced potential for HPC mobilization, and reduced potential for stable engraftment of HPC transplant. We have expanded our transplant eligibility into patients beyond the age of 60, with the concomitant acceptance of matched sibling donors of similar age. We have reviewed 96 consecutive sibling donors, 19 of whom were of age \u226560 years at the time of collection. All donors were collected using Gambro Spectra apheresis instruments, and the volume of blood pheresed was gauged to target a CD34 dose of 5-10 million per Kg of recipient weight. We have found the following:  . Age < 60 (n=77) . Age \u2265 60 (n=19) . p . Blood volumes (Mean\u00b1Std) 4.9\u00b13.3 6.1\u00b13.1 .85 CD34/RecipKg E6 (Mean\u00b1Std) 8.1\u00b12.8 5.8\u00b11.7 .02 CD34/Blood vol E7.

There is not a higher toxicity rate or need for catheter insertion associated with the collections in the older age group. There is a clear trend, however, to reduced mobilization of CD34+ cells, as reflected in the need for more collections, and fewer CD34+ cells per blood volume leukopheresed. In spite of this, sufficient cells to produce functional grafts were collected from all donors, although a limited number of donors in both age categories failed to collect a full 5e+6 CD34/Kg. We conclude that in the context of an aging demographic, allograft donors of age \u226560 may be successfully employed for HPC collection. Further, we propose that the application of plerixafor in \u226560 year old donors should be investigated in the context of a growing need to collect allografts from donors in this age group.
