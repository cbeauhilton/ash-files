In this study, we assess the efficacy and tolerability of continuous infusion (CI) cyclophosphamide in a group of heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed/refractory MM. Methods Charts of all patients treated with CI cyclophosphamide for relapsed/refractory MM between 01/2003 and 12/2008, at the Hospital of University of Pennsylvania, were identified and reviewed. Patients who had received at least one cycle of CI cyclophosphamide were included for the analysis. The dose of cyclophosphamide ranged between 200-300 mg/m2/day CI for 4 days. Duration of each cycle was planned at 28 days. Response was assessed using the international uniform response criteria for MM. Toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 4. Results We treated 24 patients with CI cyclophosphamide. The median age was 60.5 years (range 33-75 years) and 66% were male. Patients had received a median of 5 prior regimens (range 2.0 to 11.0) and the median duration of time from diagnosis to treatment with CI cyclophosphamide was 5 yrs (range 0.38-22 yrs). Cyclophosphamide was started in 19 patients for management of progressive disease, and in 5 patients for lack of response or adverse effects from prior therapies. Prior therapies included: bortezomib (in all patients), lenalidomide (in 96% of patients) and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT - once in 46%, and twice in 29%) among others. The median number of cyclophosphamide cycles administered until the time of last follow up was 4.0 (range 1.0-43.0). Treatment was ongoing in 4 patients at the time of last follow up, and two patients with stable disease were being observed without therapy. Median overall survival for all patients was 22.3 months (95% CI 10.04-34.53) and median progression free survival (PFS) was 7.4 months (95%CI 4.12-10.69). Partial response was noted in 4 patients, who had a median duration of response of 4.2 months and median time to best response of 0.8 month. Disease was stabilized in 14 additional patients. Disease progressed despite therapy in 6 patients, and in 4 of those progressive disease was evident from cycle one. Cytopenias were noted in 8 patients, with 4 related to the treatment with cyclophosphamide, but in only one case did this lead to discontinuation of therapy. Conclusion In our experience with 24 patients, monthly cycles of continuous infusion cyclophosphamide was a safe and effective method of treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma resulting in a prolonged progression free survival in very heavily pretreated patients.
