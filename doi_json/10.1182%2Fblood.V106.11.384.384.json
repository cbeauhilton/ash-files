    "abstract_text": "The platelet fibrinogen receptor \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3 exists in an equilibrium between inactive and active conformations. In its inactive conformation, the transmembrane (TM) domains of \u03b1 IIb and \u03b2 3 interact, but they separate when \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3 assumes its active conformation. Peptides corresponding to the \u03b1 IIb TM domain form homodimers in vitro and in bacterial membranes and the interface that mediates this interaction overlaps with the interface that mediates the heteromeric association of the \u03b1 IIb TM domain with that of \u03b2 3. Because the homomeric association of \u03b1 IIb TM domain is relatively strong, we expected that peptides spanning the \u03b1 IIb TM domain might activate \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3 by binding to the \u03b1 IIb TM domain, thereby disrupting the \u03b1 IIb/\u03b2 3 TM domain heterodimer. We synthesized a 26 residue peptide corresponding to the \u03b1 IIb TM domain, flanked by pairs of lysine residues to increase its solubility in water, and assessed its ability to activate washed or gel-filtered platelets in an aggregometer. Addition of 3 \u03bcM peptide induced platelet aggregation after a short lag, but unlike aggregation stimulated by ADP, peptide-induced aggregation was not preceded by platelet shape change. Nonetheless, like ADP-induced aggregation, peptide-induced aggregation was inhibited by EDTA and the \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3-specific monoclonal antibody A2A9. On the other hand, pre-incubating platelets with PGE1 or apyrase caused only a small decrease in the rate and extent of peptide-induced aggregation, suggesting that the peptide induced aggregation by binding directly to \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3. A peptide corresponding the \u03b2 3 TM domain behaved in an identical manner, whereas an unrelated peptide, the model TM domain MS-1, had no effect. Similarly, there was little response to an \u03b1 IIb TM peptide in which glycines 972 and 976, the first and last residues of a GxxxG motif, were changed to leucine. Confirming that the \u03b1 IIb TM peptide binds to \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3, we found that a FITC-labeled \u03b1 IIb TM peptide co-eluted with purified \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3 during size exclusion gel filtration. To determine whether the latter interaction involved the \u03b1 IIb TM domain, we used the TOXCAT assay. In TOXCAT, the \u03b1 IIb TM domain-mediated dimerization of a fusion protein containing the \u03b1 IIb TM domain interposed between maltose binding protein and the ToxR\u2019 transcriptional activation domain in the inner membrane of E. coli drives the activation of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene. We found that adding the \u03b1 IIb TM peptide to the bacterial growth medium consistently decreased CAT synthesis, implying that its presence impaired \u03b1 IIb-mediated fusion protein dimerization. These results provide evidence for the presence of an \u03b1 IIb/\u03b2 3 TM domain heterodimer in unstimulated human platelets and suggest that the GxxxG motif in the \u03b1 IIb TM domain is involved in its formation. Because the homomeric interaction of \u03b1 IIb and \u03b2 3 TM domains is substantially stronger than their heteromeric interaction, our data are also consistent with the hypothesis that the TM peptides disrupt the heterodimer which functions to maintain \u03b1 IIb\u03b2 3 in an inactive state. Lastly, the data suggest that stabilizing the \u03b1 IIb/\u03b2 3 TM heterodimer may represent a new approach for the development of novel anti-platelet agents.",
