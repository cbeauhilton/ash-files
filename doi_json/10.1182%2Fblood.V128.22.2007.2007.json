    "abstract_text": "Background: Cytogenetic abnormalities have been described in almost 50% of patients with MDS and area strong and independent risk factor for prognosis. The interstitial deletion in the short arm of the chromosome 12 [del(12p)], is a characteristic but rare abnormality in MDS patients. Del(12p) abnormality has been described in approximately 1-5% of patients as a sole anomaly and is also found in up to 4% of patients along with an additional cytogenetic alteration. Isolated del(12p) is classified as a good risk abnormality according to the Revised International Prognostic Scoring Systems (IPSS-R). The commonly deleted region between 12p12.2 and 12p13.1 encompasses the ETV6 gene. To date, besides mutations in the transcriptional factor ETV6 and in the cell signaling KRAS gene, no other molecular mutations have been associated with del(12p). Murine studies have highlighted a role of the transcriptional factors ETV6 and RUNX1 in the impairment of both erythroid and platelets maturation. Here we investigated the presence of alternative molecular factors associated with del(12p) possibly influencing clinical outcomes and disease phenotypes. Methods: We studied the molecular and clinical data of a total of 2834 patients with myeloid neoplasms and found that 3% (93/2834) had alterations in chromosome 12. The median age was 67 years (24-84), with a male: female ratio of 56:37. Del(12p) occurred in 71% of cases (66/93); among them 14% (9/66) had isolated del(12p), 9% (6/66) had del(12p) + 1 additional alteration and 77% (51/66) carried a complex karyotype. The additional alteration to del(12p) included -7/del 7q (N=3), del(5q) (N=1) and t(X;20) (N=1). Cases with del(12p) were also classified according to disease type (MDS=40, AML=16; MDS/MPN=10; P=.057 ) and according to MDS risk group [lower-risk (33%, 22/66) and higher-risk (45%, 30/66)]. We applied whole exome sequencing and a targeted deep sequencing panel of 64 most frequently mutated genes in myeloid neoplasms. The ETV6 (12p13.2) gene was deleted in 55% (36/66) of cases while the KRAS (12p12) gene was deleted in 32% (21/66) of cases. One-third (32%, 21/66) of patients had deleted both genes. Two patients were hemizygous for KRAS . Results: Comparing patients with del(12p) (isolated, +1 alteration) to patients without alterations in chromosome 12 (n=2741), those with del(12p) had lower hemoglobin levels compared to patients without 12p aberrations (9.2 g/dL (6-16) vs. 9.7 g/dL (3-17); P=.009 ) and lower platelets counts (47 x10 9 /L (8-577) vs. 73 x10 9 /L (2-2336); P=.04 ). We noted that patients with isolated del(12p) had a longer median OS compared to patients with del(12p) associated with a complex karyotype [14 months (1-27) vs. 7 months (5-8)] although this difference was not significant. We then analyzed the mutational profile of the del(12p) cohort (isolated, +1 alteration) and compared their mutational spectrum with that of cases diploid for 12p. The most recurrently mutated genes in cases with del(12p) compared to cases diploid for 12p included RUNX1 (27% vs. 7%; P=.01 ) and DNMT3A (27% vs. 9%; P=.04 ). When we analyzed all the cases with del(12p) abnormalities (isolated, +1 alteration and complex) the significantly mutated genes were the transcriptional factors TP53 (38% vs. 4%; P=.0001 ) and RUNX 1 (14% vs. 7%; P=.04 ) and the histone modifier ASXL1 (21% vs. 10%; P=.01 ) We then analyzed the gene expression profile of patients carrying the del(12p) abnormality and found that KRAS mRNA expression levels of patients with MDS with del(12p) had a 2-fold reduction compared to the levels of healthy subjects ( P=.017 ). Similarly, we observed also a decrease in ETV6 mRNA expression levels in patients with del(12p) ( P=.07 ). Conclusions: Patients with del(12p) had lower levels of hemoglobin and platelets counts compared to patients without this cytogenetic abnormality. Mutations in transcriptional factors such as RUNX1 were commonly detected in this cohort, suggesting a possible mechanism contributing to the role of ETV6 in the impairment of erythroid and megakaryocytic cell maturation.
