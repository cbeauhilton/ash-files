    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3922 Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common of the non-Hodgkin lymphomas, accounting for up to 30 percent of newly diagnosed cases. Current treatment options for this disease are effective, but not always curative; therefore experimental therapies are being investigated. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells typically over-express the serine/threonine mitotic kinase PLK1, which plays a key role in mitotic cell cycle progression, and has been linked to poor patient prognosis. We have discovered a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of PLK1, MLN0905, which inhibits cell proliferation in a broad range of human tumor cells including DLBCL lines. We explored the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and anti-tumor properties on MLN0905 in mouse models harboring human DLBCL disease. MLN0905 has drug-like pharmacokinetic properties and an acceptable toxicity profile making it a good clinical candidate. In human xenograft tumor tissue, MLN0905 modulates the pharmacodynamic biomarker phospho-Histone H3 (in a dose dependent fashion), enabling us to track pathway modulation in vivo. The anti-tumor activity of MLN0905 was evaluated in three human subcutaneous xenograft models OCI-LY10, OCI-LY19, and PHTX-22L (primary lymphoma). In each model, MLN0905 yielded significant anti-tumor activity on both a continuous (daily) and intermittent dosing schedule, underscoring dosing flexibility. The anti-tumor activity of MLN0905 was also evaluated in a disseminated xenograft (OCI-LY19) setting to better mimic DLBCL in humans. In this disseminated model, MLN0905 induced a highly significant survival advantage. Finally, MLN0905 was combined with Rituximab in the disseminated OCI-LY19 model. Combining Rituximab and MLN0905 provided both a synergistic anti-tumor effect and a synergistic survival advantage. Our findings indicate for the first time that PLK1 inhibition leads to pharmacodynamic pH3 modulation and significant anti-tumor activity in multiple models of DLBCL. These data strongly suggest evaluating PLK1 inhibitors as DLBCL anti-cancer agents in the clinic. Disclosures: Shi: Millennium: The Takeda Oncology Company: Employment.
