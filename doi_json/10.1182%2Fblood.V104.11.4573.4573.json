    "abstract_text": "Purpose: to analize the response rate and survival of a series of patients with disseminated large B-cell lymphoma treated with R-CHOP/21 x 8 cycles and to evaluate the prognostic factors and the prognostic value of gallium-67 imaging. Patients and Methods : 128 patients with DLCL have been prospectively treated with R-CHOP/21 from March 2002 to March 2004, ages between 18 and 85 years. Survival curves were expressed as Kaplan-Meier plots. Prognostic factors were evaluated by the Chi-square test. Survival curves were compared by the Log-rank test. Results : the median age was 65 years (limits: 27\u201383), 31% older than 70 years. 59 (54%) patients were males. Gallium imaging was positive at diagnosis in 91%. Clinical presentation of DLCL was: bulky disease: 40%, extra-nodal disease: 66% (\u00b3 2 sites: 33%), B symptoms: 41%, ECOG \u00b3 2: 53%, LDH>N: 67%, IPI \u00b3 3: 60%. Chemotherapy cycles received were:  Normal (p=0.01 y p=0.005 respectively) and ECOG \u00b3 2 (p=0.0008 y p=0.02). Conclusion : Rituximab associated with CHOP improves the results of historical series treated with CHOP for patients of all ages, but in patients with age-adjusted IPI=3 results have to be improved with other therapeutic strategies. Normalization of gallium-67 imaging at the end of treatment is predictive of a significantly better EFS. Age is not a prognostic factor in patients who receive the same treatment. For patients with disseminated disease, LDH and ECOG are the only significant prognostic factors."
