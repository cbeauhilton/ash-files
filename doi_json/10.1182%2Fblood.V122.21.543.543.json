    "abstract_text": "Background HCT cures thalassemia major (TM). In the absence of a family donor, marrow or less frequently umbilical cord blood (UCB) from unrelated donors (URD) has been used. Due to risks of graft rejection, myeloablative preparative regimens are primarily utilized. URD marrow and UCB HCT have 65-90% and 21-74% event free survival (EFS) and rejection rates of 9-17% and 17-57% respectively. The URTH trial was developed in collaboration with the Thalassemia Clinical Research Network (TCRN), National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium (PBMTC) and New England Research Institutes (NERI) to explore URD HCT for TM as a strategy to expand availability of HCT. It employed reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) as a means to decrease early and late toxicities. The study tested our hypothesis that an immunosuppressive RIC regimen was sufficient for engraftment in children with TM (age > 1 year to < 17 years) after URD HCT. The primary objective was to determine EFS at 1 year after URD marrow or UCB HCT. Methods Patients with transfusion dependent beta thalassemia and a suitable URD (matched at 8/8 HLA-alleles in marrow donors or 5 to 6/6 HLA antigens in UCB donors) were conditioned with hydroxyurea (30mg/kg x 30 days) (day -50 to -21), alemtuzumab (48 mg) (-22 to -19), fludarabine (150 mg/m 2 ) (-8 to -4), thiotepa (8mg/kg) (-4), and melphalan (140mg/m 2 ) (-3). Patients received tacrolimus or cyclosporine with methotrexate and methylprednisone (marrow) or mycophenolate mofetil (UCB) after HCT to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Suitable UCB units were defined as having a pre-thaw total nucleated cell content >4.0x10E7/Kg recipient weight. Patients were eligible irrespective of Pesaro classification but the presence of liver fibrosis by histology was an exclusion criterion. Results Twenty-three patients from 11 US centers (11M: 12F) with a median age of 10 years (2\u201317 years) received unrelated donor allografts: marrow (14) or UCB matched at 6/6 (1) or 5/6 HLA antigens (8). The median follow up time was 12 months (range 120 days-2 years). The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 13 days (range 10-25) and 34 days (range 12-46) after marrow and UCB HCT respectively. The median time to platelet engraftment after marrow and UCB HCT was 24 days (range 18-34) and 54.5 days (range 32-234) respectively. Primary graft rejection occurred in 1 patient (4% of all patients) following UCB HCT and was accompanied by autologous hematopoietic recovery 35 days after HCT. All others had >90% donor chimerism and achieved transfusion independence. There were no late graft rejections. The overall and EFS probabilities were 82% and 78% respectively at the most recent encounter. One patient developed mild VOD which resolved uneventfully. Of 15 patients who had CMV reactivation, 13 responded to pre-emptive therapy and had no progression to CMV disease. The probabilities of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD were 30% and 9% respectively. Limited chronic GVHD was noted in 35% of the cohort; 9% developed extensive cGVHD. Four patients died on days 25, 86, 106 and 366. The causes of death included 1) pulmonary hemorrhage associated with CMV, adenovirus, and Pneumocystis jiroveci infections, 2) diffuse alveolar pulmonary hemorrhage, 3) cGVHD with pneumonia associated with CMV and adenovirus infections, and 4) cGVHD with pulmonary failure associated with CMV and EBV infections and presumed central nervous system post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease. Conclusion HCT after RIC for thalassemia is feasible and sufficient for engraftment after URD marrow and UCB transplantation with survival exceeding 80%. The principal transplant- related complications we observed were early opportunistic viral reactivations; otherwise the preparative regimen was tolerated well with very little early toxicity. Fatal and late viral infections were noted only in the setting of severe GVHD. Patients should be monitored carefully and treated promptly for infectious complications after HCT until there is adequate immune reconstitution. The risk of severe GVHD was low despite unrelated and mismatched (UCB) donor sources. Longer follow up will determine if this regimen can reduce late toxicities. An extension of this trial is ongoing and currently recruiting patients to evaluate additional HCT related and quality of life measures. Disclosures: Neufeld: Shire: Consultancy.
