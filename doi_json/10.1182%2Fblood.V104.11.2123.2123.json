    "abstract_text": "Experimental evidence and preliminary clinical studies have demonstrated that human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display important immune modulatory function of potential relevant interest in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. Effectiveness of MSCs in controlling severe GVHD seems to be related to the immune-regulatory role they play in suppressing alloantigen-specific T-cell activation. Aim of the present study was to extend the analysis of the mechanisms responsible for the immune regulatory effect of interaction between MSCs and alloantigen-specific immune response elicited in vitro in primary and in secondary mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC). At difference with most previously reported studies, we decided to employ non-irradiated MSCs, reasoning that irradiation might impair, beside the proliferative capacity, also the differentiation capability of MSCs and, consequently, alter their interaction pattern with lymphocyte subsets. MSC were added to primary MLC at different doses (MLC-responder-PBMC:MSC ratios = 1:1 and 10:1). Dendritic cell (DC) differentiation, lymphocyte proliferation, alloantigen-specific cytotoxic activity and differentiation of CD4 + T-cell subsets expressing CD25 and/or CTLA4 antigens were assessed in primary and secondary MLC, comparing the effect observed using third-party MSCs with that obtained employing autologous to the MLC-responder (autologous) MSCs. Results demonstrated that human MSCs: (1) strongly inhibit alloantigen-induced DC1 differentiation; (2) down-regulate, in a dose-dependent manner, alloantigen-induced lymphocyte expansion, especially that of CD8 + T cells and of NK lymphocytes; (3) favor the differentiation of CD4 + T cells co-expressing CD25 and/or CTLA4, a phenotype associated with regulatory/suppressive function of immune response; (4) cause a dose-dependent reduction of alloantigen-specific cytotoxic capacity mediated by either cytotoxic T lymphocytes or NK cells; (5) exert more effective suppressive activity on MLC-induced T-cell activation when they are allogeneic rather than autologous with respect to responder cells. In particular, higher percentages of CD4 + and of CD4 + CD25 + T cells co-expressing CTLA4 + were detected when third-party, rather than autologous, MSCs were added to MLC. These data suggest that T-cell recognition of alloantigens expressed by MSCs may further facilitate the preferential differentiation of activated CD4 + T cells expressing CTLA4, a glycoprotein, known to deliver an inhibitory signal to T cells and to mediate apoptosis of previously activated T lymphocytes. Several studies previously demonstrated that MSCs exert inhibitory effect on lymphocyte activation through the release of soluble factors. Our data suggest that the preferential differentiation of CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T-cell subsets may be favored by other mechanisms of MSC-mediated inhibition of alloantigen-induced effector cell activation and expansion, and, in turn, these CD4 + CD25 + cells contribute to propagate and extend suppressor activity. Altogether, our results provide immunological support to the use of MSCs for prevention of immune complications related to both HSC and solid organ transplantation and to the theory that MSCs are \u201cuniversal\u201d suppressors of immune reactivity.",
