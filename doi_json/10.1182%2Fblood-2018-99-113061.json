    "abstract_text": "The circulatory half-life of recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) products is affected by glycosylation of the FVIII protein, including N-linked glycan branching and terminal sialic acid occupancy, primarily through receptor-mediated hepatic clearance (eg, asialoglycoprotein receptor [ASGPR] and lipoprotein receptor-related protein [LRP]). BAY 81-8973 (Kovaltry \u00ae , Bayer, Berkeley, CA) is an unmodified full-length rFVIII for treatment of hemophilia A. The BAY 81-8973 manufacturing process results in a product of enhanced purity with a consistently high degree of branching and sialylation of N-linked glycans. This study evaluated whether a relationship exists between N-linked glycosylation patterns and pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of BAY 81-8973 and 2 other rFVIII products (sucrose-formulated rFVIII [rFVIII-FS; Kogenate \u00ae FS, Bayer] and antihemophilic factor (recombinant) plasma/albumin-free method [rAHF-PFM; Advate \u00ae , Shire, Westlake Village, CA]). N-linked glycans or terminal carbohydrates were enzymatically removed from immobilized BAY 81-8973, rFVIII-FS, and rAHF-PFM proteins and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography to determine the percentage of individual N-linked glycan structures and degree of sialylation of each structure. PK data were available from 2 separate phase 1 crossover studies in which the PK profile of BAY 81-8973 was compared with that of rFVIII-FS (n=26) and rAHF-PFM (n=18) in patients with severe hemophilia A who received a single 50-IU/kg dose of each product. BAY 81-8973 and rFVIII-FS had increased N-linked glycan branching with higher levels of sialylation compared with rAHF-PFM. Levels of trisialylated glycans were 29.0% for BAY 81-8973 versus 11.5% for rFVIII-FS and 4.8% to 5.5% for rAHF-PFM; tetrasialylated glycans were 12.0% versus 2.8% and 0.6%, respectively. Degree of sialylation was 96% for BAY 81-8973, 94% for rFVIII-FS, and 78% to 81% for rAHF-PFM. Based on chromogenic assay results from the single-dose phase 1 PK studies, BAY 81-8973 half-life was 15% longer than that for rFVIII-FS and 16% longer than rAHF-PFM. Increases in the percentage of sialylated tri-antennary and tetra-antennary N-glycans correlated well with longer half-life of rFVIII in humans (adjusted R 2 =0.978 and 0.892 for tri-antennary and tetra-antennary N-glycans, respectively). Higher percentages of sialylation (ie, sialic acid capping) correlated with a longer half-life (adjusted R 2 =0.697), but the relationship was not as strong as that between glycan branching and half-life. Improved PK for BAY 81-8973 relative to rFVIII-FS and rAHF-PFM as seen in single-dose crossover PK studies might be related to this greater level of branching and sialylation, which may prolong the time BAY 81-8973 remains in the circulation.
