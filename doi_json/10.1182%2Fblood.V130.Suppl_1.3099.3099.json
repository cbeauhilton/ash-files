    "abstract_text": "Introduction: CD47 is an immune checkpoint coordinating the innate and adaptive immune systems which allows cancer cells to escape the innate immune response by sending inhibitory signals to macrophages and regulates the adaptive immune anti-tumor response. Hence, CD47 has been identified as a novel therapeutic target in cancers, including multiple myeloma (MM) which is localized mainly in the bone marrow (BM). MM cells rely heavily on the interactions with tumor microenvironment (TME) and immune system. Macrophages are enriched in the BM of MM patients compared to healthy controls, and were demonstrated to support MM growth, in opposition to their intrinsic phagocytic properties. We study the new class of immune checkpoint inhibitor such as anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody (mAb) which enhance MM killing. We tested two anti-CD47 mAbs provided; Vx1000R (blocking only) - blocking CD47/SIRP\u03b1 binding and Vx1004R (dual function) - blocking CD47/SIRP\u03b1 binding and inducing cell death activity. The objectives of this study were: (1) to test the expression of CD47 (Vx1000R and Vx1004R binding) to MM cells, stromal cells (MSP-1 and HS5) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) sub-populations; (2) to study anti-CD47 mAbs binding in hypoxic conditions; (3) to investigate the effect of anti-CD47 mAbs on MM cell apoptosis in 2D and the 3D tissue engineered BM (3DTEBM; a scaffold incorporating BM plasma from MM patients, MM cells, and accessory cells) to reproduce the TME; (4) to test the cytotoxicity of Vx1004R on PBMC sub-populations in 3D culture; and (5) to examine the effect of Vx1004R on MM cell phagocytosis ex vivo by macrophages. Methods: We performed meta-analysis of CD47 mRNA expression in dataset available online in healthy, MGUS, smoldering MM and MM subjects. We tested the binding of Vx1000R and Vx1004R mAbs on MM.1S, H929, RPMI8226 and U266 cells and stromal cells (MSP-1 and HS5) in normoxia (21% O 2 ) and hypoxia (1% O 2 ), and in the 3DTEBM at 24h and 72h. We also tested Vx1000R binding to PBMC sub-populations (from 12 MM patients) including CD3 (T cells), CD14 (monocytes/macrophages), CD16 (NK cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils), CD19 (B cells), CD123 (pDC and basophils) and CD138 (MM cells). Next, we examined the cytotoxic activity of CD47 mAbs on MM cells alone and in co-culture with the BM negative fraction (CD138-depleted) and stromal cells (MSP-1) in 2D cultures by performing MTT survival assay, and in 3DTEBM cultures by flow cytometry. The cytotoxicity of Vx1004R was studied on PBMCs incorporated into a similar 3D model and treated with Vx1004R; proliferation and apoptosis of different sub-populations of PBMC were assessed via flow cytometry. Lastly, the effect of Vx1004R on MM cell phagocytosis by macrophages (CD14+; green) was tested after 2h of co-culture with MM cells (pre-labeled with DiD+; red) in the presence or absence of Vx1004R. Phagocytosis was determined as double positive (green+ red+) cells by flow cytometry. Results: The meta-analysis results demonstrated that CD47 mRNA expression increases with tumor progression (compared to early stage disease and healthy subjects). We demonstrated that MM.1S, H929, U266 and RPMI8226 cells and stromal cells (MSP-1 and HS5) express high levels of CD47, which does not alter in hypoxia, and that MM cells increase CD47 expression in 3DTEBM at 72h. CD47 (Vx1000R) is expressed in different sub-populations of PBMCs with the highest expression in MM cells. In addition, we have shown that anti-CD47 dual function mAb inhibits proliferation of MM cells, especially when co-cultured with negative fraction and MSP-1 stroma in 3DTEBM cultures. Moreover, we showed that anti-CD47 mAb induces phagocytosis of MM cells ex vivo by macrophages. Conclusions: CD47 is a promising target candidate for MM treatment, since CD47 mRNA increases with MM progression, and CD47 protein increases in MM cells in the presence of TME in the 3DTEBM, suggesting involvement in pathophysiology of MM. Moreover, anti-CD47 mAb enhances killing of MM cells when co-cultured with TME; however, it does not affect apoptosis of PBMC sub-populations in the 3DTEBM. Finally, anti-CD47 mAb induces phagocytosis of MM cells ex vivo by macrophages. These results suggest that anti-CD47 mAbs are applicable for MM treatment. Further studies are warranted to examine the effect of anti-CD47 mAbs as a novel strategy to inhibit the progression and dissemination of MM in vivo, especially when combined with chemotherapy.
