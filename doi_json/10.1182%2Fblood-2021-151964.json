    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) due to an acquired deficiency in the enzyme ADAMTS13 leads to ultra-large von Willebrand multimers, thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Complications include microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis. We present an unusual case of a patient with a history of refractory aTTP who experienced relapsed aTTP following COVID-19 vaccine. Case Description: A 57-year-old African-American male with a history of refractory aTTP experienced a relapse following 3 years of remission after receiving COVID-19 vaccination. The patient was initially diagnosed with aTTP in 2016, after presenting with symptoms of dark urine, mild headaches and transient episodes of aphasia and paresthesia. Due to symptoms and persistently low ADAMTS13 levels, he required prolonged and extensive treatment including over 5 weeks of daily therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), followed by gradual reduction in frequency of TPE sessions, as well as trials of rituximab, eculizumab, steroids, mycophenolate mofetil and bortezomib. Ultimately, he achieved remission after 9 months of intermittent TPE, 3 months of weekly bortezomib 1 mg/m 2 , mycophenolate mofetil up-titrated to 1,750 mg twice daily, and then slowly tapered off over a 2-year period. The patient was doing well for 3 years without manifestations of aTTP (2 years off all therapeutics), until he developed a petechial rash 7 weeks after receiving the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. He was found to have acute thrombocytopenia with platelets of 38 x 10 9 /L (normal range 135-317 x 109/L), from a baseline of 200-300 x 10 9 /L. He was referred to the emergency department, where additional labs were notable for mildly elevated LDH of 508 U/L (normal range 122-222 U/L), hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL (normal range 13.2-16.6 g/dL), creatinine at baseline, and peripheral blood smear showing 1-3 schistocytes per high-powered field. ADAMTS13 activity level was t /= 70%), with positive ADAMTS13 inhibitor screen and titer of 1.5 (normal <0.4), consistent with relapsed aTTP. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and initiated on daily TPE, with steroids and diphenhydramine prior to each TPE session. He quickly improved with TPE alone , but given his history of refractory aTTP, he was discharged on weekly rituximab for 4 weeks and caplacizumab 11 mg daily for 30 days. His platelets remained stable within the upper limit of normal during his 30 day course of caplacizumab. However, 3 weeks after completion of caplacizumab, he had an acute drop in his platelets to 23 x 10 9 /L. His ADAMTS13 level was again found to be <5%, and inhibitor level was the highest that it had ever been at 11.4. He was again hospitalized and underwent 8 sessions of daily TPE, as well as re-initiation of caplacizumab, mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg bid (with increasing taper), and a prednisone taper. Intravenous Cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 was also added every 3 weeks. With this regimen, patient's platelet count normalized and remain stable, and his ADAMTS13 activity level has reached 52-59%. Discussion: Cases of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) have been described as a complication following vaccination with formulations containing replication-defective adenoviral vectors (AstraZeneca-Oxford and Johnson&Johnson COVID-19 vaccines)(Arepally and Ortel 2021, Simpson, Shi et al. 2021). VITT and aTTP are both immune-mediated, however, VITT is distinct and pathogenically linked to autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), given the presence of anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies in these patients, whereas aTTP is due to reduction in ADAMTS13 level, secondary to an antibody inhibitor of ADAMTS13 (Arepally and Ortel 2021). Recently, cases have been reported of de novo aTTP developing shortly after COVID-19 vaccination with all available vaccines, except the Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccine (Al-Ahmad, Al-Rasheed et al. 2021, de Bruijn, Maes et al. 2021, Maayan, Kirgner et al. 2021, Ruhe, Schnetzke et al. 2021, Waqar, Khan et al. 2021, Yocum and Simon 2021). Additionally, cases of relapsed aTTP have been described following only the BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine (Maayan, Kirgner et al. 2021, Sissa, Al-Khaffaf et al. 2021). This is the first case, to our knowledge, reported in the literature of aTTP following vaccination with Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
