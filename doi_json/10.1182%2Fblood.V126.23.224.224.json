    "abstract_text": "Background: Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is defined by the detection of mutations in genes like DNA methyltransferase 3A ( DNMT3A ) and has recently been described to occur in healthy people and to predispose them to myeloid malignancies. DNMT3A is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and mutations have been detected in CD3 positive T-cells of some AML patients. In these patients DNMT3A mutations are early events that are likely to arise from CHIP. It is unknown how a history (hx) of CHIP influences the characteristics of AML patients and their response to therapy. We studied this question on the basis of a large cohort of DNMT3A mutated AML patients. Patients and Methods: 171 DNMT3A mutated AML patients (aged 18-87 years) were included in our study. 127 patients were treated intensively in trials of the AMLSHG and AMLSG. 34 patients received non-intensive therapy and for 10 patients the therapy is unknown. 148 patients carried a mutation at arginine R882. At the time of diagnosis and relapse samples were further sequenced for 54 genes involved in leukemia with next generation sequencing (NGS) on the Illumina platform. Library preparation of diagnostic samples was performed with the TruSight Myeloid sequencing panel (Illumina). T-cells (CD3 + CD11b - CD14 - CD33 - ) were purified by flow cytometry from AML samples at the time of diagnosis. DNMT3A mutational analysis of T-cell samples and of mononuclear cells during remission or at relapse was performed also with ultra-deep sequencing using customized DNMT3A NGS primers. Presence of a DNMT3A mutation in sorted T cell populations was used as an indicator of a hx of CHIP . Results: A total of 40 patients (23%) were found to have the DNMT3A mutation in mononuclear cells and T-cells ( hx of CHIP ), while 131 patients (77%) had a DNMT3A mutation in mononuclear cells, but not T-cells ( control cohort ). Comparing these two patient cohorts revealed that significantly more patients in the hx of CHIP cohort had secondary AML (p=0.009), were older (p=0.005) and less likely to receive intensive treatment (p=0.047) while other clinical parameters did not significantly differ. Analysing the mutational profile of 54 genes revealed that the number of mutations per patient between these 2 groups was similar (median 5 vs 4 mutations, p=0.39). Patients with a hx of CHIP were significantly more likely to harbour mutations in TET2 (p=0.006), RUNX1 (p=0.004), SF3B1 (p=0.049), U2AF1 (p=0.015) but less likely to be NPM1 mutated (p=0.005). There was no significant difference in the allelic burden of DNMT3A in the CHIP hx (mean 43.6) vs control group (mean 44.5). The mean variant allele frequencies of DNMT3A , RUNX1 and NPM1 were highest (44, 45 and 43 respectively) as compared to other mutated genes like IDH1 , IDH2 and FLT3 (32, 37 and 34). In relapse samples (n=11), the identical DNMT3A mutation could always be identified. However, patients with a hx of CHIP (n=2) had comparable allelic frequencies compared to diagnosis of mutated DNMT3A (<10% difference), but not NPM1 (> 10% difference), while 7 out of 9 patients in the control group had a change in the allelic frequency at the time of relapse (mostly reduction). In all remission samples DNMT3A mutations could be identified with ultra-deep NGS but with variable allelic frequencies (0.13-50.01% in the control group, 0.25-70.14% in the hx of CHIP group). In the cohort of patients with intensive therapy there was no difference in CR rates between hx of CHIP and control groups (82 vs 90%, p=0.31). Overall survival (OS) was not influenced by a hx of CHIP (whole cohort: HR 1.09; 95%CI 0.67-1.79; P=.73; intensively treated cohort: HR 0.72; 95%CI 0.34-1.51; P=.38). Relapse-free survival (RFS) was also not different in the hx of CHIP vs the control group (HR 1.06; 95%CI 0.58-1.93; P=.85; intensively treated cohort only HR 0.91; 95%CI 0.46-1.78; P=.78). However, when looking at the influence of allogeneic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) on outcome in intensively treated patients, patients with a hx of CHIP showed abenefit from HSCT (HR 0.082; 95%CI 0.009-0.75; P= 0.027 Figure 1A) as compared to the control group (HR 0.68; 95%CI 0.39-1.21; P= 0.19, Figure 1B). Conclusion: AML patients with a hx of CHIP , as defined by mutated DNMT3A in T-cells, show a distinct clinical and molecular profile and may benefit from HSCT. Figure 1A.
