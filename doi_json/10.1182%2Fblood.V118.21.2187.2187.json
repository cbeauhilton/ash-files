    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2187 Plasma cells, the terminal effectors of the B-cell lineage include both short- and long-lived cells. The latter persist for extended periods in the absence of cell division, supported in niche environments. No model system has successfully recapitulated the function of the niche to allow the in vitro generation of long-lived plasma cells. This limits investigation into the factors controlling and targeting plasma cell populations. Here we describe the generation of mature human plasma cells with extended lifespan from peripheral blood B-cells. Cell division accompanies phenotypic maturation between plasmablasts and plasma cells. These cells then persist in the absence of cell division, remaining functional and viable in extended culture, currently limited solely by elective termination. Extended survival is accompanied by maturation to a phenotype consistent with human bone marrow plasma cells. By establishing a set of conditions sufficient to allow the development and persistence of mature human plasma cells in vitro, we recapitulate the essential function of the plasma cell niche. We definitively link phenotypic maturation to lifespan and provide the first platform with which to explore and manipulate the full trajectory of human plasma cell differentiation.
