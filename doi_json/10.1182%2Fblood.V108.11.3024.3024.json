    "abstract_text": "Myeloablative transplant has been investigated in poor prognosis indolent lymphoma; although recurrence rate is low it is associated with high mortality; the use of non-myeloablative conditioning regimens could reduce TRM maintaining the GVH effect. Up to May 2006, 35 patients with follicular NHL received a Non Myeloablative related allogeneic according to two prospective multicenter trials; conditioning regimen consisted of Fludarabine 150 mg and Melphalan 70\u2013140 mg. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CSA plus short-course MTX. All patients received filgrastim-stimulated peripheral blood stem cells from a HLA related identical donor. Median age at transplant was 50 years (34\u201362) and 16 (46%) had received a previous autologous transplant. At transplant, 5 patients (14%) were in CR1 (after several lines of chemotherapy), 9 (25%) in >CR1, 12 (34%) in PR, 1 (3%) had stable disease (after 3 chemotherapy lines) and 8 (23%) progressive disease. All patients engrafted. Acute GVHD developed in patients 19 (54%) (17patients (48%) grade II-IV). Chronic GVHD developed in 18 out of 27 patients at risk (67%), being extensive in 11 (41%). Disease was evaluated at day +100 and at that moment 23 patients were in CR, (85%) 1 (4%) in PR, two (7%) had stable disease and 9 patients ( 26%) have died. With a median follow up of 60 months (range: 32\u201380 months), 20 patients (57%) are alive disease free, and 14 (43%) have died, 12 of them (37%) due to transplant toxicity and 2 patients (6%) due to progression. Overall Survival (OS) and Event Free Survival (EFS) are 57 and 54 % respectively. Analysing variables which influence on OS and EFS, patients 55 years have a OS significantly shorter than those <55 years old (22% vs 69%; p:0,007). Moreover, patients who develop chronic GVHD have an EFS significantly better than those which do not develop it (78 % vs 44%; HR: 3,9 (1,0\u201314,6); p: 0,03). In conclusion, our results demonstrates high efficacy of non-myeloablative transplant in follicular NHL with a very low relapse rate, indicating the important role of chronic GVHD in the control of the disease; however, mortality rate is still high, mainly in patients 55 years. Although follicular lymphoma is considered as an incurable disease, our results after a large follow-up suggest that allogeneic effect could change this concept.",
