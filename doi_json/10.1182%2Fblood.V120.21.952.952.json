Ongoing exposure to TAA on normal cells may lead to tolerance via anergy or exhaustion of antigen-specific T cells. Methods: We have designed a model of tolerance to TAA in which T cell receptor (TCR)-transduced CD8 T cells recognise pMDM2, a TAA that is also a ubiquitous self-antigen. CD8+ T cells were transduced with pMDM2-specific TCR (MDM-CD8) and transferred to sub-lethally irradiated B6 mice that express pMDM2 in the context of MHC Class I (H2-K b ). MDM-CD8 cells are detectable 4 weeks after transfer but show defective in vivo killing of target cells pulsed with MDM2 peptide. We have used this model to determine the mechanism of tolerance and to evaluate whether tolerant CD8+ T cells can be rescued by CD4 help. Results: To determine whether tolerance of MDM-CD8 cells was dependent upon recognition of cognate antigen, we transferred MDM-CD8 cells into mice of a different MHC background (BALB/c) which lack H2-K b required for presentation of the TCR-recognised MDM2 peptide. When BALB/c MDM-CD8 cells were transferred to BALBc hosts their functions were preserved and they retained efficient antigen-specific cytolysis. To determine whether tolerance could be modified by provision of CD4+ T cell help, we co-transferred MDM-CD8 with transgenic OT-II CD4+ cells. OT-II cells were primed with dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with cognate pOVA323-339 or irrelevant peptide. When activated through their TCR, OT-II cells increased both the frequency of MDM2-specific CD8 cells and their cytotoxic functions, indicating that CD4 help can overcome CD8 tolerance to TAA. Ineffective antigen presentation to CD4 cells and lack of known MHC class II-restricted TAA are major limitations to providing CD4 help in T cell therapy for cancer. We therefore tested whether transfer of the MHC Class I-restricted MDM2 TCR into CD4 cells could provide help upon transfer to antigen-expressing hosts. Co-transfer of MDM2-TCR-transduced CD4 cells with CD8 cells improved antigen-specific killing of target cells when compared to single transfer of either TCR-transduced CD8 or CD4 cells. Conclusion: CD4 cells rendered capable of responding to an MHC class I restricted TAA by TCR transfer can rescue tolerance developing in a CD8 population with the same specificity. This is potentially a novel way to circumvent defective immune responses arising in adoptively transferred effector cells due to prolonged exposure to cognate antigen on normal host cells.
