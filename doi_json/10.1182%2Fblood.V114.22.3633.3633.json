    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3633 Poster Board III-569 Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess an immunomodulatory function and show promise as a cell therapy for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In a phase II study in Europe, injections of MSCs caused 60-70% overall response rate, with longer survival of complete responder. In contrast to its clinical efficacy, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying immunomodulation by MSCs has not been fully established. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1), and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase have been reported to mediate the immunomodulatory function of MSCs, and we reported evidence that nitric oxide is also a mediator (Blood 2007, 109, 228). Th17 is a recently recognized differentiation category, in which CD4 cells produce IL-17. It has been reported that Th17 is crucial for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (a model of the human disease, multiple sclerosis) and is also thought to be important in other autoimmune diseases. Regulatory T cells (Treg) are another newly recognized differentiation category, in which CD4 T cells have high levels of Foxp3 expression and suppress T cell proliferation. It has been reported that Th17 and Treg can be induced by incubation with TGF-b1 and IL-6 or IL-21, and TGF-b1 and IL-2, respectively, and that these two differentiations are in a reciprocal relationship. Whereas the role of Th17 in GVHD is still controversial, Treg has been reported to suppress GVHD in a mouse model. To elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) of the immunomodulatory function of MSCs, we herein sought to identify the effects of MSCs on these relatively new differentiations. MSCs inhibit Th17 differentiation even in conditions in which growth is not completely inhibited. Interestingly, an inhibitor of prostaglandin production, indomethacin, and an inhibitor of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, 1-methyltryptophan, partially restore Th17 differentiation, whereas inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase do not. These results suggest that PGE2 and depletion of tryptophan, but not nitric oxide, mediate inhibitory effects of MSCs on Th17. Additionally, we found that MSCs produced PGE2 when co-cultured with CD4 T cells in Th17 differentiation condition and PGE2 per se suppresses Th17 differentiation. Thus, our results suggest that MSCs block Th17 differentiation through PGE2 prodction. In contrast to Th17 differentiation, Treg differentiation was not significantly inhibited by MSCs. However, MSCs still inhibited proliferation of T cells under these conditions, and T cell proliferation was restored by the addition of indomethacin. These results suggest that MSCs inhibit proliferation but not Treg differentiation through PGE2 production. The mechanism by which PGE2 differentially regulates these differentiations is unknown and remains an area for further investigation. Disclosures: Ozawa: Alexion: Research Funding.",
