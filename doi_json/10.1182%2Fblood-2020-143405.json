    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION Adverse effects are common during treatment of hematological malignancies. Treatment toxicities can impact quality of life [1], impose financial hardship and cause cancer related distress[2]. Symptom monitoring using electronic technology can facilitate early detection of complications[3], reduce symptom burden[4], cost of care[5] and improve survival[6]. Cancer treatment also increases risk of mortality from infections such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and routine screening has been recommended[7]. METHODS We developed an application that periodically delivers toxicity questionnaires to patients during treatment . Based on NCI- PRO-CTCAE\u2122, the questions are delivered through SMS or e-mail. Patient responses crossing prespecified thresholds trigger automated alerts on a dashboard, resulting in additional interventions as needed. Nature and time to intervention is tracked. Patient experience is measured using a Likert-scale and free-text box. Centers for Disease Control recommended COVID-19 screening questions were incorporated. Finally, a distress thermometer for cancer distress screening has been recently added. The app was offered to patients with hematological cancers in a community-based cancer center. RESULTS Since introduction in April 2020, we have enrolled 37 patients. 9 patients had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 6 diffuse large B cell, 5 mantle cell, 4 Hodgkin's and 3 follicular lymphoma. 2 each had chronic myelogenous, multiple myeloma and Richter's syndrome. 1 each had hairy cell leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia and T Cell lymphoma. Median age was 64 years (range 24-85). Patient experience has been favorable. On a scale of 1-5, 85.5% rated the experience as 3 or higher. Median patient engagement, calculated by dividing the number of forms completions by number of days enrolled was 34.2% (0.9-66.2 %). Symptom tracker captured 536 responses. Fatigue (153), no symptoms (152), shortness of breath (57), nausea/vomiting, diarrhea (46) and numbness/tingling (28) were the most common response categories. Of 1107 completed check ins, 75 triggered flags. There were 2 hospitalizations for neutropenic fever with the remainder managed as outpatients. Average time between patient generated response and provider intervention was 90.9 minutes. 88% follow-ups were completed within 1 business day. COVID-19 screening module captured 1096 responses. 988 were no symptoms. All positive responses (44 diarrhea, 39 cough, 23 shortness of breath and 2 fever) were false positives. Distress thermometer implemented a week before data cut-off captured 2 responses, 1 in the physical and 1 in the psychological domain. CONCLUSION We demonstrate feasibility of electronic capture of treatment toxicities and offer proof of concept that a mobile app can be used for infection screening. Additionally, the quick response time by care team indicated a high adoption rate.
