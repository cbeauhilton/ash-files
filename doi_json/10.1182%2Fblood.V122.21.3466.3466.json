    "abstract_text": "Introduction Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) has been suggested to be an essential effector mechanism for the in vivo activity of tumor-targeting therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Thus, enhancing the affinity of human IgG1 mAbs to NK cell-expressed Fc\u03b3RIIIa by glyco- or protein-engineering of their Fc moiety has been demonstrated to improve NK cell-mediated ADCC and represents a promising strategy to improve antibody therapy. However, human polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells express the homologous Fc\u03b3RIIIb isoform, which does not trigger ADCC. The aim of the present study was to analyze a panel of distinct IgG1 mAbs, displaying different affinities for Fc\u03b3RIIa and Fc\u03b3RIII, with respect to PMN recruitment for tumor cell destruction. Methods Affinities of analyzed mAbs to distinct Fc\u03b3R were determined by surface plasmon resonance technology. Induction of ADCC was assessed by 51 Cr release experiments in the absence or presence of Fc\u03b3RIII- or Fc\u03b3RII-blocking agents to unravel the contribution of both receptors in these assays. Results Non-fucosylated or protein-engineered IgG1 variants with optimized Fc\u03b3RIII binding capacities demonstrated the expected benefit in triggering NK cell- mediated ADCC but did not mediate ADCC by PMN, which could be restored by Fc\u03b3RIIIb blockade. Additionally, eosinophils as well as PMN from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients \u2013 expressing no or low levels of FcgRIIIb \u2013 mediated effective ADCC with FcgRIII-optimized mAbs. Additional experiments with Fc variants displaying enhanced Fc\u03b3RIIa binding or with double Fc\u03b3RIIa/Fc\u03b3RIII-optimized constructs demonstrated enhanced PMN-mediated ADCC compared to control mAbs. Statistical analyses revealed that Fc\u03b3RIIa/Fc\u03b3RIIIb affinity ratios correlated with the extent of human PMN-mediated ADCC. Conclusions To conclude, the present study represents novel findings concerning recruitment of PMN for tumor cell destruction by Fc-engineered antibodies. While PMN-mediated ADCC was completely abolished by Fc\u03b3RIII-optimized antibodies through predominant Fc\u03b3RIIIb binding, it was potently enhanced by optimization of Fc\u03b3RIIa binding affinity. Importantly, functional analyses unraveled the ratio between Fc\u03b3RIIa and Fc\u03b3RIII binding affinities to control PMN-mediated ADCC activity and therefore opened new alleys in engineering of therapeutic antibodies.
