    "abstract_text": "Integrins are a superfamily of transmembrane (TM) \u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimers that mediate fundamental cellular adhesive functions. Platelet integrins, for example, mediate stable platelet adhesion to collagen and fibronectin and the formation of stable platelet aggregates. Integrins reside on cell surfaces in an equilibrium between inactive and active conformations. An essential feature of this equilibrium is interaction of the integrin \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunit TM domains. Thus, when integrins are inactive, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 TM domains are in proximity, but they separate when integrins assume an active conformation. Moreover, inducing TM domain separation alone is sufficient to cause integrin activation. Previously, we reported that the TM domains of the platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 interact both heteromerically and homomerically and that the strength of their heteromeric interaction is necessarily weak to allow regulated TM domain separation. To address whether these observations can be extended to the other members of the integrin superfamily, we focused initially on \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b12\u03b21 and \u03b15\u03b21, integrins present in platelets, using a dominant-negative ToxR-based assay. ToxR is a single-pass TM transcriptional factor from V. cholera that activates the cholera toxin (ctx) promoter when it dimerizes in the inner membrane of E. coli. By co-expressing wild-type ToxR with either wild-type ToxR or an R96K ToxR mutant that can dimerize but is unable to activate the ctx promoter, we can measure the homomeric and heteromeric interaction of each integrin TM domain. Using alanine and leucine scanning mutagenesis, we found that like \u03b1IIb, homo-oligomerization of other integrin \u03b1 subunit TM domains is preferred over hetero-oligomerization, and that the relative strength of homo-oligomerization correlates with the presence of a canonical small residue-xxx-small residue motif followed one turn of the TM helix by a leucine (G, A, S-xxx-G-xxx-L). This motif also mediates the hetero-oligomerization of these TM domains with either \u03b23 or \u03b21. By contrast, a different motif (V-xxx-I-xxx-G) mediates the heteromeric interaction of both \u03b23 and \u03b21 with their complementary \u03b1 subunits. Mutations that disrupt either the \u03b1IIb or \u03b23 interaction motif induce constitutive \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation. To determine if this is also the case for \u03b21-containing integrins, we introduced disruptive interfacial mutations into the full-length integrins and expressed the mutants in either the \u03b21-deficient Jurkat A1 cells or in HEK293 suspension cells. We found that the \u03b21 mutations V716A, I720A and G724L caused a substantial increase in the static adhesion of A1 cells to laminin, fibronectin, the \u03b14\u03b21-specific peptide H1, as well as type I, II and type IV collagen, whereas mutation of the canonical G-xxx-G motif did not. On the other hand, an increase in binding to type I collagen and fibronectin was observed for mutations of the interfacial \u03b12 residues S1009, G1013, and L1017 and the interfacial \u03b15 residues A964, G968, and L972, respectively. Thus, our studies indicate that \u03b21 and \u03b23 integrins employ a novel, specific, and conserved reciprocating \u2018large-small\u2019 TM packing interface that interacts less strongly than the canonical small-residue-xxx-small residue motif. It is also noteworthy that this interface is present in all integrins except \u03b24 and is overrepresented in databases of TM helix-helix interaction as well. Accordingly, it is likely that this type of interface evolved to mediate TM domain interactions that are capable of regulation."
