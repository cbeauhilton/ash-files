    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The outcomes of Adolescent and young adult (AYA) have been studied in various hemato-oncology subsets. Patients of AYA-ALL have improved outcomes by paediatric-inspired or fully paediatric protocols. The outcomes published from trials are different from the actual practise, that too in the real-world settings with resource constraints. Objective: To study the characteristics and outcomes of AYA-ALL from real world settings. Methodology: It is a retrospective observational study wherein the data of all patients of AYA-ALL managed at a tertiary care center in North India over the last 14 years (2004-2018) were analyzed. All case records of the AYA-ALL were perused, digitalized and their survival statistics derived. Results: Amongst a total of 611ALL case records, 116 (18.98%) were AYA-ALL. AYA-ALL cases with complete data (n-116) were analysed for overall survival. The mean age of the patients was 26.65 \u00b1 6.61 years (range 16-39) (Fig. A). Males constituted 32.7% (n-78) and females, 67.2% (n-38) of AYA-ALL. On risk stratification, 67 (57.7%), 26 (22.4%), and 23 (19.8%) patients were classified as standard, intermediate and high risk. Phenotypically, 78 patients were B-ALL, 23 were T-ALL and rest were MPAL. Of these 61 patients (52.5%) received adult ALL (GMALL protocol), 26 patients (22.3%) received paediatric BFM protocol, 19 patients (16.3%) received Hyper-CVAD, 8 patients (6.8%) MCP841 protocol and 2 received modified drugs not adhering to any fixed protocol. Week 4 Bone marrow evaluation was in CR in 91.4% of patients. L-Asparaginase was given in only 74.5% of the patients. An interruption in the therapy of more than 2 weeks for various reasons was present in 35% of the patients. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was given in 42.4% of the patients and high dose methotrexate was given in 25.2% of the patients. Relapse was seen in 27.7% of the patients. CNS disease was present in 9.4% of the patients. Only 8% of the patients were subjected to transplant. The cumulative overall survival at 1y (1y-OS) was 86.98% with 3y and 5y OS being 67.9% and 55.6% (Fig. B). The survivalsbased on the type of protocol was statistically different with the best survival with GMALL protocol and the least survival with Hyper-CVAD therapy (log rank p-0.0011) (Fig.C). The survival was also significantly different between different risk groups (p-0.003) (Fig.D). The survival was not statistically different between males and females (p-0.5), B-ALL vs T-ALL (p-0.6) (Fig. E, F). Conclusion: We have demonstrated in this study the improved outcomes of AYA-ALL who usually present in late chronic phase in resource constraint settings. Contrary to the belief, adult GMALL protocol had better survival vis-\u00e0-vis pediatric BFM protocol in this cohort of AYA-ALL. Figure. View large Download slide Figure.
