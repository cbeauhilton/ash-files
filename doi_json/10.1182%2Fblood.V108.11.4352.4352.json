    "abstract_text": "Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) interferes with a number of cellular pathways involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. Since TGF\u03b2 is a potent inducer of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in hematopoietic lineages, we were interested in examining whether TGF\u03b2 signaling is blocked in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and if so whether KSHV plays a role in this repression. Treatment with TGF\u03b21 had no effect on either cell cycle or apoptosis in several PEL cell lines. The defect in this pathway was found to be a lack of the TGF\u03b2 type II receptor (T\u03b2RII), expression. Upon transfection of T\u03b2RII, PEL cell lines become responsive to TGF\u03b21 treatment. We are currently examining how T\u03b2RII transcription is regulated in PEL. The lack of T\u03b2RII expression in some tumors has been attributed to altered chromatin structure due to hypoacetylation. Treatment with both a demethylating agent and a histone deacetylase inhibitor resulted in expression of this receptor in PEL. Several KSHV latent gene products are known to interact with or recruit p300, a histone acetyltransferase, for other cellular processes. It is possible that the interaction of one or more of these viral gene products with p300 may serve to prevent it from acetylating histones associated with the T\u03b2RII gene and thereby repress its transcription. We have also found by ELISA that PEL cells secrete a higher level of TGF\u03b21 than other TGF \u03b2 responsive B cell lines. Increased secretion of TGF\u03b21 in conjunction with downregulation of T\u03b2RII may be a mechanism by which KSHV creates an immunosuppressed environment while allowing infected cells to grow free from the constraints of this pathway.",
