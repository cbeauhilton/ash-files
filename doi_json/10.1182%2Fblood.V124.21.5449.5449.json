    "abstract_text": "Background: We describe single center experience of using ABVD/COPDac . This regimen was adapted due to perceived excessive toxicity with OEPA/COPDac by treating physicians. Hodgkin lymphoma is being treated with multiple treatment regimens single agent or in combination. MOPP (mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisolone) has been standard treatment for almost two decads. But it had significant toxic effects including infertility in both genders, myelosuppression and second malignancies . ChlvPP( chlorambucil, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisolone ) has comparable efficacy and toxicities to MOPP . ABVD( Adriamycin, bleomycin, vincristine and doxorubicin ) was mostly used as second line with high activity without permanent male sterility, myelodysplasia or risk of leukemia. Objective : We describe single center experience of using ABVD/COPDac . This regimen was adapted due to perceived excessive toxicity with OEPA/COPDac by treating physicians. Results 62 patients out of 301( 20.6%) with age range of 2-18 years were treated with COPDac/ABVD alternating courses depending on the treatment group from 2012 to date. Out of this 62, 49 (79%) are on follow up and are free from disease relapse or recurrence. Mean duration of follow up is 12 months with a range of 8-16 months. No patient lost to follow up. No death reported due to any cause during or after completion of treatment till last follow up. 9 out of 62 has had progression of disease while on this treatment protocol (15%) and 4 out of 62(6%) has had relapse after completion of the therapy. Conclusion In our single center experience of ABVD/COPDac as first line therapy seems effective and safe when compared with historical published literature. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
