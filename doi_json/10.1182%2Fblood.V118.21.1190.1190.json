    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1190 Introduction: The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two prophylaxis regimens of reformulated recombinant coagulation factor IX (rFIX-R), 100 IU/kg once weekly and 50 IU/kg twice weekly, compared with on-demand treatment in subjects with severe hemophilia B. Patients and Methods: Pharmacokinetic data were collected for 47 subjects aged 6 to 64 years with severe hemophilia B. Factor IX activity (FIX:C) measurements were made immediately before rFIX-R administration and at 0.5 hours post-administration of either 100 IU/kg or 50 IU/kg doses, to assess recovery before the initiation of each weekly regimen. Another FIX:C sample was collected at least 72 hours after dosing during each regimen. All samples were analyzed at local laboratories. Results: The mean prophylactic doses of rFIX-R administered were 86 \u00b1 29 IU/kg in the 100 IU/kg once-weekly group and 53 \u00b1 14 IU/kg in the 50 IU/kg twice-weekly group. The treatment comparison between the two prophylaxis regimens for annualized bleeding rate was not significant (LS mean = 2.0; 95% CI, \u22121.2 \u2013 5.2; n=43), although both were significantly different from the on-demand treatment period (both, P <.0001). The number of new bleeding events in each group was 51 and 35, respectively, with only 12/51 new hemorrhages occurring within 72 hours of dosing in the 100 IU/kg once-weekly group compared with 29/35 in the 50 IU/kg twice-weekly group. The pharmacokinetic results are shown in the Table.  . C 0hr (IU/dL) . C 0.5hr (IU/dL) . Recovery (IU/dL/IU/kg) .

View Large The number (%) of observed trough plasma concentrations (C trough ) that fell into the mild (>5%) range for hemophilia were 18 (45%) and 19 (48%) for the r-FIX-R 100 IU/kg once-weekly and 50 IU/kg twice-weekly groups, respectively. However, the severe phenotype was observed in 4 (10%) and 3 (7%) subjects, respectively. Conclusions: The pharmacokinetics of r-FIX-R are dose proportional. The C 0.5hr increased in proportion to the dose administered. Recovery was consistent between the two prophylaxis regimens. Both regimens provided similar therapeutic results for C trough . The apparent difference in time after dose of new bleeding events between the 2 regimens is intriguing and deserves further study. Disclosures: Korth-Bradley: Pfizer Inc: Employment.
