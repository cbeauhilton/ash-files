    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3471 AML with the internal tandem duplication of the Fms-Like Tyrosine kinase-3 gene (FLT3-ITD) has a poor prognosis, with high relapse rates. Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor of tyrosine kinases including Flt-3 with activity in AML. We used this drug to treat patients relapsing after allogeneic HSCT and herein present the results. Patients and Methods. We retrospectively evaluated 16 patients with FLT3-ITD AML that received sorafenib for at least a 7-day course either alone (n=8; 50%) or in combination (n=8; 50%) to treat AML relapsing at a median of 3 months (range, 1\u20137) after HSCT. Median age was 34 years (range, 20\u2013603). Cytogenetics was diploid in 69%, high-risk in 19% and unknown in 12%. Treatment history prior to HSCT included sorafenib in 38% of the cases, and 30% were status post a 2 nd HSCT. Donors were related (50%) or unrelated (50%). Seven patients (44%) received and failed other salvage chemotherapy prior to starting sorafenib (median=2 treatments; range, 1\u20135). At start of sorafenib salvage treatment, median WBC was 22.5 K/mm 3 (range, 0.6\u2013119), and median bone marrow blast was 58% (range, 12\u201388%), while 75% of the patients had circulating blasts. Sorafenib doses were as follows: 400 mg (n=3) or 800 mg daily (n=4) in combination to idarubicin/Ara-C, or 800 mg daily with 5-azacitidine (n=1); single agent: 800 mg (n=6) or 1200 mg (n=2) daily. Median duration of sorafenib single agent therapy was 39.5 days (range, 10\u2013100), and in combination it was 7 days (range, 7\u201332). Complete remission (CR) rate was zero; 2 patients achieved a PR. Median reduction in bone marrow (n=9) and peripheral blood (n=12) blasts was 0% (range, 0\u201346), and 50% (range, 0\u201388), respectively. Two patients were \u2018bridged\u2019 to a 2 nd HSCT, which led to CR durations of 53 and 106 days. Median survival after sorafenib initiation was 81 days and it was similar with single agent versus combination therapy ( Figure 1 and 2 ). All patients have died. Conclusions. Treatment of overt AML relapse with sorafenib was unsuccessful as described here. It is possible that \u2018pre-emptive\u2019 treatment in the presence of minimal residual disease will be more effective, but this remains to be proven. Figure 1.
