    "abstract_text": "Targeting the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl is an attractive therapeutic strategy in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) and in Bcr-Abl positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Imatinib is a selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase and is now used in frontline therapy for CML. However clinical resistance is the main concern using this treatment, mediated by mutations within the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl, amplification of the BCR-ABL genomic locus or other as yet unknown mechanisms. AMN107 (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) is a synthetic, second generation inhibitor of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. In the current study, we tested AMN107 against different Bcr-Abl positive cell lines such as K562, LAMA84, AR230 or murine Ba/F3 cells transfected with BCR-ABL (BaF/ BCR-ABL ). In a 4 day proliferation assay (MTS) the dose of AMN107 that inhibited 90% of the cells (IC90) was 0.01 \u03bcM which was 100-fold lower than the IC90 of imatinib. In addition, proliferation of imatinib resistant cell lines which exhibited amplification of BCR-ABL was inhibited by 75% in the presence of 0.01 \u03bcM AMN107. However, Ba/F3 cells expressing the imatinib resistant BCR-ABL T315I mutant were only inhibited with 10\u03bcM of AMN107. Furthermore, K562-R, an imatinib-resistant cell line exhibiting a new mechanism of imatinib resistance (modification of chaperone proteins such as heat shock proteins) was also insensitive to AMN107; the IC90 for AMN107 at day 4 was 1\u03bcM versus 4\u03bcM for imatinib. Finally, we investigated potential resistance to AMN107 in Bcr-Abl positive cells. Resistant cell lines were generated after long-term (2 month) gradual dose-escalation exposure to the inhibitor. Up to now, we have obtained four cell lines, AR230-ra, K562-ra, LAMA 84-ra, and BaF/BCR-ABL-ra resistant to 8, 10, 10, and 100 nM of AMN107, respectively. Resistance was defined as the capacity to survive in the continuous presence of doses of AMN107 that kill in three days more than 90% of the parental cells in liquid culture. Preliminary investigations of AMN107 resistance using western blot and cytometry have shown that only BaF/BCR-ABL-ra overexpressed wildtype Bcr-Abl as we have already reported for imatinib resistance. Studies with these resistant cell lines investigating cross resistance with imatinib and looking for additional mechanisms of resistance are in progress.We conclude that in vitro, AMN107 is more powerful than imatinib in inhibiting the proliferation of BCR-ABL positive cell lines. In addition, we have demonstrated that it is possible to develop resistant cell lines to this new inhibitor of Bcr-Abl.",
