    "abstract_text": "Purpose: The HD8 study of the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) demonstrated that involved field (IF) radiotherapy is equally effective when compared with EF radiotherapy after four cycles of chemotherapy (2 x COPP/ABVD). Since there are indications that elderly patients with HD might fare worse depending on the type of treatment applied, we revisited the HD8 data for possible differences between younger and older patients. Methods and results: A total of 1204 patients were randomised to receive two double cycles of COPP/ABVD and either 30 Gy EF + 10 Gy bulk or 30 Gy IF + 10 Gy bulk. Of these, 98 evaluable patients were older than 60 years and 1038 patients were younger than 60 years. In general, there were more risk factors such as B-symptoms, elevated ESR, and poorer Karnofski index in the elderly group. On the other hand, there were fewer bulky tumours, large mediastinal tumours and a lower number of lymph node areas involved in elderly patients. The toxicity of treatment was more pronounced in elderly patients with 76 of 96 patients experiencing chemotoxicity Grade III or IV (79%) compared with 699 of 1018 (69%) in those younger than 60 years. After a median follow up of 52 months, the 5-year-FFTF was 85% in younger patients and 63% in patients older than 60 years (p <0.001). The 5-year-overall survival was 94% for patients younger than 60 years and 66% for patients older than 60 years (p < 0.001). In addition, patients older than 60 years treated with EF had a trend for worse FFTF and overall survival compared to those receiving IF radiotherapy. Conclusion: Event-free and overall survival of patients older than 60 years old are worse compared with younger patients. In particular, patients older than 60 years receiving EF radiotherapy had a poorer prognosis.",
