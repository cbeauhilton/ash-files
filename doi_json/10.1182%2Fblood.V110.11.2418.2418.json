    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Protein kinases C (PKC) isoforms are key regulators of several Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling pathways. In the present study, we investigated the role of conventional PKC\u03b1 in the MyD88-dependent TLR2-mediated activation of dendritic cells (DC). Methods: We compared the functional and molecular responses of DC derived from wild type and PKCa deficient mice to TLR2 stimulation. We next investigated the consequences of conventional PKC (cPKC) inhibition during TLR2 stimulation in human monocyte-derived DC using the cPKC pharmacological inhibitor Go\u03086976. Finally, reporter gene assays were performed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably expressing TLR2 in the presence of dominant negative (DN) PKC\u03b1. Results: Bone marrow-derived DC from PKC\u03b1 deficient mice showed an attenuated response to the TLR2/1 ligand Pam 3 CSK 4 characterized by a statistically significant reduction in interleukin (IL)-12p40 and TNF\u03b1 production. IL-6 synthesis was also reduced albeit not significantly. In western blot analysis, PKC\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 DC displayed an impaired phosphorylation of the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) in response to Pam 3 CSK 4 . TLR2-mediated activation of the I\u03baB kinases (IKK) \u03b1 and \u03b2 and inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB) degradation were abolished in PKC deficient DC, suggesting an impaired nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB activation. In human monocyte-derived DC, inhibition of conventional PKC activity by the isoform specific inhibitor Go\u03086976 severely decreased cytokines production in response to TLR2 ligands. At the concentration of 1\u03bcM, Go\u03086976-treated DC exhibited impaired p38 and JNK activation. The NF-\u03baB activation pathway was repressed with higher concentrations of the pharmacological inhibitor. Finally, in reporter gene assays, DN PKC\u03b1 but not DN PKC\ud835\udec9 repressed AP-1 and NF-\u03baB mediated promoter activity upon TLR2 engagement. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that PKC\u03b1 is a key component of the MyD88-dependent TLR2 signalling pathway in dendritic cells and regulates the activation of NF-\u03baB and MAP kinases pathways."
