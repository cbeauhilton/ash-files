    "abstract_text": "Among chromosomal abnormalities described in myeloma (MM), deletion of chromosome 13 (\u039413) has been linked to a poor outcome. However, prognosis appears to vary according to the detection method used: conventional cytogenetics (CC) or FISH. We have investigated this inconsistency in a large multi-center cytogenetic study. Bone marrow samples from 814 MM patients were provided from 95 UK hospitals. FISH on purified plasma cells (n=697) and/or CC (n=577) was performed centrally: 458 samples had both tests. Sample quality was often poor, with low cell counts (median 2x10 7 and low plasma cell (PC) content (median 9%), precluding both tests on all samples. FISH for \u039413, t(4;14), t(11;14), gain of chromosomes 5, 9, 15 and, where possible, 3, 7 &17 was carried out. Overall survival was used as the end point with median follow-up of 22mo (range 12\u201353mo). Abnormalities were detected by CC in 216 cases (37%). Non-hyperdiploidy (non-HRD) (\u226447 chromosomes, n=82, 14% of total, 38% abnormal) was a stronger indicator of poor prognosis than hypodiploidy (\u226445 chromosomes, n=55, 10% of total, 25% abnormal) (p96% and sensitivity >92%. There was complete agreement between CC and FISH for individual abnormalities. CC showed a highly significant difference in prognosis between abnormal karyotypes with (n=95, 44%) and without \u039413 (median 15 months vs not reached, p20% PC, n=322, 46%) to have the worst outcome among the individual abnormalities (median 30mo vs not reached, p50% or >80% PC, or by considering only \u039413 in non-HRD cases (median 29mo vs 49mo, p=0.001), consistent with our CC results. When patients with results from both CC and FISH were examined, the outcome for \u039413 by CC was significantly worse than by FISH only (median 15mo vs 33mo, p<0.001). The survival figures were identical for the total data set, despite some patients having had one test only (Fig1B). Comparison of the two survival curves showed that, despite both \u039413 by FISH and CC having p values of <0.001, there was a large difference in actual survival between these two groups (30mo vs 15mo) and multivariate analysis of all genetic markers showed only \u039413 by CC to be an independent variable. This multi-center study has clearly implicated \u039413 seen by CC as an independent indicator of poor prognosis, with \u039413 by FISH probably only informative within a prognostic index, regardless of modifications by ploidy or proportion of abnormal cells. Thus, we recommend CC as the most appropriate prognostic test for myeloma. Fig 1. View large Download slide Survival curves for \u039413 by FISH (A) & by CC &/or FISH (B) Fig 1.
