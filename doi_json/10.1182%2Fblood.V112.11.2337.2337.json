    "abstract_text": "Mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from bone marrow into peripheral blood by the cytokine G-CSF has become the preferred source of HSPCs for clinical stem cell transplants. However, up to 10% of donors fail to mobilize sufficient numbers of stem cells impeding autologous transplants or significantly delaying transplant recovery time. Consequently, novel regimens are warranted to increase the number of stem cells in peripheral blood upon mobilization. Using a forward genetic approach in the mouse, we map the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to a genetic region on murine chromosome 11 modifying G-CSF-mediated HSPC mobilization. Expression levels of EGFR in HSPCs were inversely correlated with HSPC mobilization, implying a negative role for EGFR signaling in mobilization. Genetic reduction of EGFR activity (waved2 mice) or treatment with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib increased stem cell mobilization up to 5-fold in combination with G-CSF. Increased mobilization due do alteration of EGFR activity correlated with reduced activity of Cdc42 and consequently, inhibition of Cdc42 activity in vivo by a specific Cdc42 inhibitor similarly enhanced mobilization. Our findings reveal a novel signaling pathway regulating stem cell mobilization and thus provide new rationale for targeted pharmacological approaches to further improve HSPC mobilization and thus transplantation outcomes."
