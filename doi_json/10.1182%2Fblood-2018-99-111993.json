    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are among the most common recipients of allogenic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. However, whether restrictive RBC transfusion strategies for cardiac surgery achieve a similar clinical outcome in comparison with liberal strategies remains unclear. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Trials, and conference proceedings from inception to December 2017 for all randomized trials (RCTs). The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes were stroke, respiratory morbidity, renal morbidity, infections, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac arrhythmia, gut morbidity, reoperation, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (hours), and hospital length of stay (days). We calculated the risk ratios (RR) and weighted mean difference (MD) for the clinical outcomes using a random-effects model. Results: We included 9 RCTs with a total of 9,005 patients. There was no significant difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.74-1.45; P=0.86). In addition, there were no significant differences between groups in the clinical outcomes of infections (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.94-1.26; P=0.26), stroke (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.72-1.35; P=0.91), respiratory morbidity (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.89-1.24; P=0.58), renal morbidity (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.94-1.09; P=0.68), myocardial infarction (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.80-1.24; P=0.99), cardiac arrhythmia (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.88-1.26; P=0.56), gastrointestinal morbidity (RR 1.93; 95% CI 0.81-4.63; P=0.14), or reoperation (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.67-1.20; P=0.46). There was a significant difference in the intensive care unit length of stay (hours) (MD 4.29; 95% CI: 2.19-6.39, P<0.01) favoring the liberal group. However, there was no significant difference in the hospital length of stay (days) (MD 0.15; 95% CI -0.18-0.48; P=0.38). Conclusion:This meta-analysis showed that restrictive strategies for RBC transfusion are as safe as liberal strategies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Key points: Restrictive strategies for red blood cell transfusion are as safe as liberal approaches in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Longer duration of stay in the intensive care unit is more common in patients managed with a restrictive transfusion approach. However, the overall hospital length of stay appeared to be similar between both groups. Further studies are needed to ascertain threshold triggers for RBC transfusion. Figure.
