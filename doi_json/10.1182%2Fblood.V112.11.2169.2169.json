    "abstract_text": "Long-term survival after HLA-matched sibling transplants for SAA is 80\u201390% in patients 40 years (n=127). Beyond 40 years, we were unable to find an age effect despite 44% of patients in this group being \u226550 years. Patients older than 40 years were more likely to have received >50 red blood cell transfusions, immunosuppressive therapy (65% vs. 50% in patients 40 years, respectively. Recovery was more likely with peripheral blood transplants (odds ratio [OR] 1.96, p=0.022). Neutrophil recovery was lower with cyclophosphamide alone (OR 0.50, p=0.002) and fludarabine-containing conditioning regimens (OR 0.44, p=0.033). In contrast, age at transplantation was associated with platelet recovery (day- 100). Recovery was lowest in patients >40 years (89%) compared to 94% in patients 40 years. As shown in the Table below mortality risks increased with age. The 5-year probabilities of overall survival after adjusting for performance score, preparatory regimen, interval from diagnosis to transplantation, donor-recipient sex match and cytomegalovirus serostatus, factors affecting overall survival, were 81%, 72% and 53% in patients aged 40 years, respectively (p6 months from diagnosis to transplantation (RR 1.50, p=0.001) and female recipients receiving grafts from male donors (RR 1.57, p=0.001). Mortality rates were lower when both donor and recipient were CMV sero-negative (RR 0.53, p40 years was significantly lower compared to younger patients. Longer interval from diagnosis to transplantation, higher numbers of pretransplant red blood cell transfusions and poor performance scores at transplantation may explain the inferior outcomes in patients >40 years. Use of peripheral blood grafts did not affect overall survival (p=0.169). The data suggest there is a need to improve survival in older patients; early referral for transplantation and improved supportive care may improve outcomes.  Outcome . Relative Risk . P-value .
