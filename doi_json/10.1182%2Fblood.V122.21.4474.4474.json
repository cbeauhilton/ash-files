    "abstract_text": "Background Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) is one of the main complications of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Donor CD4 + conventional T cells (T conv ) as well as regulatory T cells (T reg ) are the key-players in its pathogenesis. Rapamycin (sirolimus, rapa) is a mTor inhibitor that can suppress activation and proliferation of T conv without inhibiting T reg . Aims To assess the impact of a combined treatment with T reg and rapa on experimental cGvHD. Methods Lethally irradiated BALB/c mice were injected with 10x10 6 bone marrow cells and 70x10 6 splenocytes from B10.D2 donor mice. Mice were divided in four groups on day -1 and treatments were started on day 20 with either PBS, rapa 1 mg/kg/Day, T reg 1.10 6 cells (D+20), or rapa 1 mg/kg/Day + T reg 1.10 6 cells (D+20). T reg (CD4 + CD25 + cells) were purified from spleen cells from donor B10.D2 mice using the CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, GmbH, Germany). T reg purity (defined as CD4 + FoxP3 + cells) was \u2265 70% of total cells and > 92% of CD4 + T cells. The severity of sclerodermatous cGvHD was assessed with the following clinical scoring system. Briefly, animals were individually scored every 3 days for five parameters: weight loss (1, 10-20%; 2, > 20%), posture (1, kyphosis only at rest; 2, severe kyphosis when the animal moved), activity (1, moderate activity impairment; 2, no move unless stimulated), skin (1, erythema or scaling tail; 2, open lesion on the body surface) and hair loss (1, > 1 cm 2 ; 2, > 2 cm 2 ). Mice which reached a score of 8 were estimated to have terminal GvHD and were sacrificed. Terminal GvHD-free survivals between the 4 groups were compared using the Log-rank test. Results The effects of the treatments were evaluated 7 days after starting the treatments (D+27 post-transplantation). Numbers of total and central memory and effector memory CD4 + T cells/\u00b5L were significantly ( p <0.05) decreased in rapa-, T reg -, and T reg + rapa- treated mice compared to PBS mice, while numbers of na\u00efve CD4 + T cells/\u00b5L were significantly ( p <0.05) decreased in T reg -, and T reg + rapa- treated mice. Further, proliferation of CD4 + T cells (assessed by Ki67 expression) was significantly decreased in rapa- ( p <0.05) and T reg + rapa- treated mice ( p <0.05). In addition, counts and proliferation of CD8 + T cells/\u00b5L were significantly ( p <0.05) lower in rapa- and T reg + rapa- treated mice compared to PBS mice. Importantly, terminal-GvHD-free survival was significantly shorter in PBS mice than in T reg (P=0.03), rapa (P=0.04), and T reg + rapa mice (P=0.02). Conclusion Our results showed that T reg and rapa administration improved cGvHD in this model of cGvHD. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
