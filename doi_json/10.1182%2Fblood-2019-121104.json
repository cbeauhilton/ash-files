    "abstract_text": "Apoptosis plays a key role, not only in normal homeostasis but also in protection against genomic instability. Protection against apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer and is mainly regulated by the overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl or Mcl-1. This results in increased survival of the tumor cells and resistance to therapy. This presentation will focus on MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia 1), its expression and its role as potential target in multiple myeloma (MM). MCL1 gene regions are one the most amplified gene regions in several human cancers and Mcl-1 activity is often associated with therapy resistance and relapse. Mcl-1 binds to and sequesters the pro-apoptotic BH3 proteins, thereby preventing apoptosis. Mcl-1 is overexpressed on MM cells from newly diagnosed patients compared to normal plasma cells and in MM cells at relapse. This overexpression is furthermore associated with a shorter survival of these patients. Increased Mcl-1 expression can result either from genetic lesions or by induction through interaction with the bone marrow microenvironment. Its expression is correlated with the molecular heterogeneity of the myeloma patients; while the CCDN1 group has high BCL2 and low MCL-1 expression; the MMSET and MAF group has high MCL-1 and low BCL2 expression. Unlike Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl, Mcl-1 has a large unstructured aminoterminus and its activity is mainly dependent on posttranslational modifications. The bone marrow microenvironment, by producing high levels of interleukin 6, also induces the upregulation of Mcl-1. Furthermore, our group recently demonstrated that not only stromal cells in the bone marrow microenvironment, but also MDSC (myeloid derived suppressor cells) induce survival of MM cells by increasing Mcl-1 levels through the AMPK pathway. As such, these data suggest the potential therapeutic benefit of targeting Mcl-1 in MM patients. Developing the first-generation inhibitors appeared to be challenging, especially in view of the occurrence of unwanted off target effects. Recent preclinical data with new, selective Mcl-1 inhibitors show promising anti-tumor effects both in vitro and in in vivo myeloma models, either alone or in combination with the Bcl-2 selective inhibitor, venetoclax, especially as it was demonstrated that high levels of MCL-1 are associated with venetoclax resistance in MM. In addition, it was also shown that proteasome inhibition can trigger Mcl-1 accumulation, further pointing to the importance of Mcl-1 inhibition. Induction of NOXA, as an inhibitor of Mcl-1, is also suggested as a therapeutic option, especially in combinations with other drugs. Clinically, following preclinical results, several new Mcl-1 inhibitors have entered phase I trials. Most of them are still recruiting patients, and as such too early to have results.
