    "abstract_text": "Since the introduction of reduced-toxicity conditioning prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) we transplanted from 1999 to 2012, 250 consecutive patients (pts) with myeloid malignancies (AML, MDS) aged \u2265 60 years (yrs). The 144 male and 106 female pts with a median age of 66 yrs (range 60-77) were transplanted for de novo AML (n=95), s/tAML (n=104) and MDS (n=51) with 89% unfavorable cytogenetics (CALGB). Since 2004 pts received a prospective fitness assessment (Deschler et al., Haematologica 2013). In 74% the donor was matched/mismatched unrelated and in 26% related. Only 16% were transplanted in CR1/2, 84 % with advanced or untreated disease. The conditioning regimen was the FBM protocol (fludarabine, carmustine, melphalan; Bertz et al., JCO 2003) in 98%, and 97% of the pts received PBSC. For GVHD prophylaxis in 91% a combination of cyclosporine plus alemtuzumab or ATG-F\u2122 was used. At day +30, 94% of the pts had achieved CR by standard measures. With a median follow up of 57 months (3-157) 37% of the pts are alive; main causes of death were relapse (n=62), infection (n=35) and age-related diseases (n=13). The probability of OS/DFS was at 1yr 61%/49%, at 2 yrs 49%/41% and at 5 yrs 37%/34%, respectively. The probability for NRM at 1 yr is 24%. Nineteen known prognostic factors for outcome were evaluated: e.g. patient and donor age, graft size, days between diagnosis and alloHCT, CMV, early/advanced disease, cytogenetics, Sorror and Gratwohl score, donor type, HLA-identity. In the multivariate analysis a better OS (factors with p<0.1; table ) was seen with a matched donor; a better DFS with a related donor, and high CD34+ graft content; in contrast, a mismatched donor is a risk factor for reduced DFS.

View Large In conclusion, this unique large cohort of older pts with AML/MDS with mainly advanced disease and unfavorable cytogenetics shows a high feasibility, safety and efficacy of alloHCT after the FBM protocol. AML/MDS pts in their 7 th and 8 th decade of life fit for transplant should be evaluated for alloHCT as very important long-term curative option.
