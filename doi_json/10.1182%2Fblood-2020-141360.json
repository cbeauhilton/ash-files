    "abstract_text": "Background: Risk stratification for Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL) has been refined with advances in the understanding of disease biology. Although nonspecific, beta 2 microglobulin (\u03b22M) levels correlate with disease burden and are considered a prognostic marker in several hematologic malignancies. Recently, we and others have shown the association of \u03b22M levels with survival in AL. In this study, we evaluated the role of \u03b22M as a predictor of outcome for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HCT) in patients with AL. Methods: We identified 175 consecutive patients with AL who received auto-HCT between 2009 and 2019 at our institution. A \u03b22M\u22653.5 mg/L, regardless of renal function status was used as a cutoff value. Hematologic and organ responses were evaluated according to the Consensus Guidelines for AL. Revised Mayo staging system was utilized for Cardiac staging. Results: The median age at auto-HCT was 60 years (range, 27 to 77). Of 175 patients, 153 (87%) had a \u03b22M value available, of whom 57 (37%) had a \u03b22M \u2265 3.5 mg/L. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups, except for the higher level of LDH, worse renal function, and more patients with renal involvement in the \u03b22M \u2265 3.5 group, and more patients with lambda light chain type in the \u03b22M <3.5 group (Table 1). The median follow-up from auto-HCT was 38 months (range; 1 to 124). One-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 2%. The 1-year NRM was 5% (n=3) and 1% (n=1) in patients with \u03b22M\u22653.5, and \u03b22M<3.5, respectively (p=0.115). Hematologic CR after auto-HCT was seen in 21 (37%), and 38 (40%) patients with \u03b22M\u22653.5 and \u03b22M<3.5, respectively (p=0.864). Organ response (OR) after auto-HCT was seen in 36 (73%), and 65 (71%) patients with \u03b22M\u22653.5 and \u03b22M<3.5, respectively (p=1.00). The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 66%, and 74% in patients with \u03b22M\u22653.5, and \u03b22M<3.5 (p=0.17) (Figure 1A).The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 73%, ad 89% in patients with \u03b22M\u22653.5, and \u03b22M<3.5 (p=0.009) (Figure 1B). On Cox-regression multivariate analysis, cardiac involvement with AL (p=0.043), and \u03b22M\u22653.5 (p=0.029) were associated with a shorter OS. Conclusion: In this single-center retrospective analysis, we showed that high serum \u03b22M is associated with shorter OS. \u03b22M may be incorporated as a prognostic marker for AL if these findings are confirmed in larger studies.
