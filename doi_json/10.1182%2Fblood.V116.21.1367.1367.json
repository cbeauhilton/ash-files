    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1367 Previously, we have shown that gene expression profiles (GEP) of CLL cells from lymph nodes (LN), bone marrow (BM), and peripheral blood (PB) are significantly different from each other. Among the major pathways associated with differential gene expression, a \u201ctolerogenic signature\u201d involved in host immune tolerance is significant in regulating CLL progression. The genes associated with the tolerogenic signature are significantly differentially expressed in patient LN-CLL compared to BM-CLL and PB-CLL, suggesting that LN-CLL cells induce this immune tolerance. From 83 differentially expressed genes identified by GEP that are associated with immune dysregulation, we selected eleven genes ( CAV1, PTPN6, PKCb, ZWINT, IL2Ra, CBLC, CDC42, ZNF175, ZNF264, IL10, and HLA-G ) for validation studies to determine whether these genes are also dysregulated in the Emu-TCL1 mouse model of CLL. The results demonstrate a trend of upregulation of these genes as determined by qRT-PCR in the LN-tumor microenvironment. To further evaluate the kinetics of selected gene expression during tumor progression, we determined the expression levels of Cav1, Ptpn6, and Pkcb at 12, 24, and 36 weeks of CLL development in the Em-TCL1 mouse model. We found that the expression of all three genes increased as a function of age, indicating a correlation of gene expression with disease progression. In addition, as CLL progressed in these mice there was a marked decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The murine data were further validated using CLL cells from the same patients with indolent versus aggressive disease indicating a similar trend in expression as CLL progressed (n=4). Furthermore, patient data analyzed by Kaplan Meier analyses of the expression levels of the selected genes indicated a significant association between down-regulation of PTPN6 (p=0.031) and up-regulation of ZWINT (p<0.001) with clinical outcome as determined by a shorter time to treatment (p<0.05). Functional analysis by knockdown of CAV1 and PKCb in primary patient CLL cells determined by MTT assay showed a decrease in proliferation following knockdown of these genes (p<0.005). Protein-interaction modeling revealed regulation of CAV1 and PTPN6 by one another. Additionally, the PTPN6 protein regulates B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and subsequently the BCR regulates PKCb. Therefore, these data from both mice and humans with CLL, argue that an aggressive disease phenotype is paralleled by expression of genes associated with immune suppression. In particular, evidence presented here suggests, dysregulation of CAV1, PTPN6, ZWINT, and PKCb expression promotes CLL progression. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
