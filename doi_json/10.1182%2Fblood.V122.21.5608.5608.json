    "abstract_text": "The actual standard of care of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) includes rituximab in combination with chemotherapy, with overall response rates \u00a0up to 76 %.\u00a0 However, this treatment may not be accessible to many patients because of limited economical resources, particularly in \u00a0developing countries, where most of the treatment must be paid from the pocket of patients or their families. \u00a0\u00a0In Mexico, since 2011 a Federal program has fully covered \u00a0\u00a0the treatment of patients with DLBCL. At the Instituto Nacional de Cancerolog\u00eda (INCan) in Mexico city 214 \u00a0patients with ths disease have been treated without cots with the standard of care. \u00a0\u00a0The \u00a0\u00a0mean age at diagnosis was 56.7 +15.9 (22-91). This series of cases was compared with a retrospective analysis of cases with DLBCL seen at the INCan between 2006-2008 \u00a0None A total of 264 cases were retrospectively analyzed.\u00a0 No differences were found in demographic and clinical characteristics at the time of diagnosis. However, a clear\u00a0 positive impact was found in the group that received full treatment thanks to this new social coverage by this new social security program. The follow-up and completion of treatment was 99%., \u00a0\u00a0In contrast: from 264 in the retrospective group, 209 (79 %)\u00a0 were treated, but only 29 (10.9 %) were able to receive an optimal treatment, including rituximab.\u00a0 These differences in treatments had a clearly impact\u00a0\u00a0 on the response rate, as shown in the following table:   A: Retrospective cases.
