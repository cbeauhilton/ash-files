    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2399 The quality and depth of response particularly achievement of complete remission (CR) have been associated with significant improvement in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival in multiple myeloma patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplant. Achievement of CR is considered a valid surrogate endpoint for survival in clinical trials for patients with multiple myeloma. We performed a phase II study investigating the role of sequential bortezomib/dexamethasone followed by thalidomide/dexamethasone as maintenance therapy post single autologous PSCT. The objectives were to examine the feasibility, toxicities, CR, PFS and overall survival rates. Within 4\u20138 weeks of autologous PSCT using melphalan 200mg/m2, pts received weekly bortezomib (bor) at 1.3mg/m2 /wk \u00d7 3 weeks with 1 week rest and dexamethasone (dex) at 40mg/d \u00d7 4 d for 6 months, followed by thalidomide (thal) at 50 \u2013200mg/d and dexamethasone (dex) at 40mg/dx4 d for 6 more months. Single agent thalidomide was then continued until disease progression. Between March 2008 and June 2010, forty-five pts were enrolled. Median age was 54 years (29-71). Median time from diagnosis was 6.1 mo. (3.5 \u2013 145.9). Disease stage at diagnosis; by Salmon-Durie (I/II/III 2/8/34/1 not available) and by ISS (I/II/III 18/14/8/ 5 not available). Pts received prior induction treatment with thal/dex (15), bortezomib based (27) and lenalidomide based regimens (10). Median B2M at enrollment was 1.8 mg/L (1.05 -5.3). Disease status at enrollment included complete remission (CR) (11), very good partial response (VGPR) (11), partial response (PR) (23). Six pts had chromosome 13 abnormalities (1 pt by karyotype and 5 pts by FISH), 2 pts had t 4;14 (one with concurrent ch 17 p del) and 3 pts had complex cytogenetic abnormalities. Results: Forty-five pts have been enrolled and undergone transplant. Five pts were unable to start planned maintenance therapy due to development of grade II or more neuro toxicities (4), and persistent thrombocytopenia (1) after PSCT. Thirty nine pts started maintenance bor/dex within 4\u20138 weeks of PSCT. One pt is too early for maintenance therapy. Twenty-five pts have completed the planned 6 months of bor/dex. Ten pts stopped bor/dex because of low WBC (2), PN (4), diagnosis of adrenal cancer (1), myocardial infarction (MI) (1), and relapse (2). Six pts are still receiving maintenance bortezomib. With a median F/U of 8.5 mo. (0.2 -24.0) twelve of 44 evaluable pts (27%) have achieved CR post PSCT and 17 of 33 evaluable pts (51%) have achieved CR after bor/dex on an intention to treat (ITT) analysis. Fifteen of 25 pts (60%) who have completed 6 months of bor/dex have achieved CR. Nine of 25 pts (36%) have upgraded their response with bor/dex. Eight pts (24%) could not complete bortezomib due to toxicities. At one year post PSCT fourteen of 28 evaluable pts (50%) remain in CR. Six pts have relapsed of whom 2 died of relapsed myeloma (leptomeningeal disease 1 pt). One pt experienced MI while receiving bortezomib (grade IV). Grade III toxicities have occurred in 17 pts; low platelet (1), asthenia (2), mood alteration (1), GI (severe constipation due to partial bowel obstruction on thalidomide) (1), skin rash (1), hyperglycemia (1), lymphopenia (10), sinus bradycardia (1), elevated triglyceride (1), DVT (1), low phosphate (3), leukopenia (1), edema (1). Sixteen pts had peripheral neuropathy (PN) grade I prior to start of bortezomib. Only 8 pts have developed new PN on the study and all are grade I-II. No patient has experienced grade III-IV PN. Median bortezomib dose is 1.3 mg /m2 per week. Conclusion: Prolonged weekly bortezomib maintenance therapy is well tolerated and can upgrade response post single autologous PSCT with no severe peripheral neuropathy. Fifty one percent of pts have achieved CR and 36% have upgraded their response after six months of bortezomib/dexamethasone therapy suggesting this is an active maintenance strategy post PSCT.
