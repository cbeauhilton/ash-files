    "abstract_text": "+ The first four authors contributed equally to this project. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of blood cell disorders, characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and severe cytopenias, which often transform to acute leukemia. MDS is also considered to be a clonal stem cell disease driven by alterations that are both genetic and epigenetic. However, it remains unclear how stem cell function is dysregulated and what factors drive these alterations in MDS HSCs. MSI2 is an important RNA-binding protein in normal HSC maintenance and can promote aggressive myeloid leukemia. Our preliminary data indicate that MSI2 expression is increased in high-risk MDS compared to low-risk MDS and correlates with poor survival. In order to model the role of MSI2 in MDS, we utilized the NUP98-HOXD13 transgenic (NHD13) model, which recapitulates many salient features of MDS including, leukopenia, severe anemia, erythroid dysplasia and leukemic transformation. Despite the lethal MDS or AML disease found in primary NHD13 animals, bone marrow cells transplanted into congenic mice generate a non-lethal MDS that rarely transform. Depletion of Msi2 utilizing a conditional knockout ( NHD13-Msi2 f/f -MX1-Cre ) reversed the MDS phenotype and after one month the diseased HSPCs were eliminated. Conversely, we found that tetracycline inducible MSI2 overexpression in the context of the NHD13 transgene (NHD13/MSI2 mice) resulted in a worse MDS disease and a fully penetrant and lethal transformation to an AML, which was further accelerated during serial transplantation. AML arising in NHD13/MSI2 mice remained dependent on sustained MSI2 overexpression as mice removed from doxycycline demonstrated improved survival. Most interestingly, MSI2 overexpression expanded and maintained a more activated (G1) MDS hematopoietic stem and progenitor compartment (HSPC) in NHD13 cells. Gene expression profiling of the LSKs (Lineage lo , c-Kit + , Sca1 + ) before disease progression identified 891 significant genes, of which 137 genes were up-regulated (log2 fold change > 0) and 754 genes were down-regulated (log2 fold change <= 0). Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) demonstrated a more progenitor like gene expression signature, enrichment in an NRAS activated signature, and a reduced quiescent phenotype. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the NHD13/MSI2 LSK gene signature in MDS patients resulted in four distinct clusters. Clusters segregated MSI2 high expressing MDS patients and this \"MSI2 high cluster\" predicted poor survival. In summary, our findings suggest that MSI2 plays a critical functional role in the maintenance of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor compartment in MDS and highlights it as a novel therapeutic target in this disease.
