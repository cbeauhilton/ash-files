    "abstract_text": "Imatinib has remarkable activity in CML in all phases, with high rates of hematologic and cytogenetic response. However, in AP and BP responses are frequently less than complete hematologic remission (CHR), including partial hematologic remission (PHR) and return to chronic phase (second CP). The objective of this study was to investigate whether different responses to imatinib conferred a survival advantage in pts with CML in AP and BP. We evaluated 214 pts in AP and 76 pts in BP (11 lymphoid, 63 myeloid, 2 unclassified) treated with imatinib. Median age for AP pts was 49 yrs (range: 22\u201382 yrs) and for BP, 54 yrs (19\u201375 yrs). With a median follow-up of 49 months (1.9\u201367.5 months), 82 (38%) AP and 66 (87%) BP pts have died. A CHR and major cytogenetic (CG) response (MCR) have been achieved in 87% and 53% of AP pts, and 37% and 14% of BP pts, respectively. For AP pts the median overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were 65 and 49 months, respectively. In BP pts, median OS and PFS were 7 and 3 months. The OS by best response to imatinib was as follows:  Response . No. (%) . Median OS (months) . p value . Median PFS (months) . p value . CG CR=complete CG response (Ph=0%), CG PR=partial CG response (Ph<35%), CG minor=minor CG response (Ph=35\u201395%), Marrow CR/PR=marrow complete/partial response Accelerated phase CG CR 96 (45) Not reached <0.0001 Not reached <0.0001 CG PR 13 (6) 43  28  CG minor 13 (6) 48  31  CHR 57 (27) 34  22  PHR 16 (7) 14  6  Resistant 11 (5) 5  3  Blast Phase CG CR 6 (8) Not reached <0.0001 Not reached <0.0001 CG PR + minor 8 (11) 12  5  CHR + PHR 12 (16) 13  11  Second CP 6 (8) 9  4  Marrow CR/PR 9 (12) 5  4  Resistant 25 (33) 4  2  Response .
