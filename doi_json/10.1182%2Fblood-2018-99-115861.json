    "abstract_text": "Background Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant hematologic disease with high incidence in the elderly peoples. The median age of onset is 65 years. There is no standard chemotherapy regimen for elderly AML, especially for AML patients older than 70 years old. Six to eight courses of low-dose or reduced-dose chemotherapy were commonly used in clinical treatment. However, most patients. However, most patients relapsed within six months after chemotherapy. How to prolong the survival of elderly patients with AML is a realistic problem that needs to be urgently solved. Patients and Methods From Jan 2017 to May 2018, six elderly patients with AML in our center include in the study. The median age was 74 (70-78) years. According to cytogenetics and molecular mutation, 1 patient were favorable risk with t (8, 21) and AML1-ETO, 3 patients were intermediate risk with karyotype abnormality, and 2 patients were unfavorable risk with complex karyotype and FLT3-ITD mutation. One patient received complete remission (CR) after IA induce scheme, and then, he received 4 courses of DA regimen for consolidation therapy. At last, he stopped chemotherapy because of severe atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Other 5 patients treated with 4-8 courses of decitabine (Dec) +CAG or HAG regimen. Minimal residual disease (MRD) of four patients were negative and two patients were positive before include in the study. Six patiens were given 10-day low dose Dec regimen treatment (5mg/m 2 /day\u00d710 days) for every six weeks, until AML progress. Results For 2 MRD positive patients, after 10-day low dose Dec regimen treatment, one patient MRD turn to negative, one patient MRD remained positive, and died after 4 months. Till Jul 2018 (median observation time 10 months), 5/6 patients remained CR and survival with better quality of life. the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were related to hematocytopenia. The most significant reduction of blood cells was hypoleucocytosis, and mainly in the first 2 courses of G-Dec treatment. Conclusion Preliminary research shows 10-day low dose Dec regimen treatment has Significant effect and mild side effect on the survival of elderly AML patients. The multicenter, randomized controlled clinical study will conduct to further verify its effectiveness and safety. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
