Adoptive transfer of CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs has emerged as a promising therapy for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic HSCT (aHSCT), solid organ transplantation and autoimmune diseases (Hanash AM, Blood 2005; Copsel S, Wolf D, Haematologica 2019; Marek-Trzonkowska N, Diabetes Care 2012; Tang Q, J Mol Cell Biol 2012) . Our prior work was the first to demonstrate a two-pathway in vivo strategy targeting TNFRSF25 (with TL1A-Ig fusion protein) and CD25 (with low dose IL-2, IL-2 LD ) receptors can elicit a rapid and strong increase in Treg numbers and function ( Wolf D, BBMT 2017 ). In fact, very low numbers of these in vivo expanded donor Tregs exhibited effective GVHD suppression in recipients following aHSCT ( Copsel S, BBMT 2018 ). Based on these findings and the success of IL-2 LD in pre-clinical and clinical studies, we asked: are there phenotypic/functional differences between Tregs expanded via IL-2 LD , TL1A-Ig or their combined application (TL1A-Ig+IL-2 LD )? METHODS : Mice were administered IL-2 LD , TL1A-Ig or TL1A-Ig+IL-2 LD over 6 days. Splenic and lymph node (LN) Treg phenotype was determined by flow cytometry. Treg functionality was assessed with sorted populations using an in vivo MHC-mismatched aHSCT. RESULTS: Treatment of C57BL/6-FoxP3 RFP mice with TL1A-Ig+IL-2 LD versus IL-2 LD only treatment resulted in significantly higher levels of activation/differentiation and functional markers on Tregs including KLRG1, CD103, Nrp1, ICOS ( Fig. 1A ). Ki67 expression was higher in two-pathway versus IL-2 LD stimulation alone ( Fig.1B ). These data suggested a key role for TNFRSF25 stimulation. Notably, Treg stimulation with TL1A-Ig alone drove the above phenotype indicating a pathway difference between the TNFRSF25 and IL-2 receptors. This difference was further apparent as high affinity IL-2 receptor (CD25) expression was reduced after TL1A-Ig +/- IL-2 LD -mediated expansion compared with IL-2 LD alone stimulated Tregs ( Fig. 1A ). Results were corroborated using a second independent mouse strain, BALB/c, following use of these protocols. To begin addressing if the observed phenotypic differences between CD25 vs. TNFRSF25 + CD25 expanded Tregs could be related to a more potent Treg in vivo suppressive activity, an initial MHC-mismatched aHSCT (donor/recipient = C57BL/6-BALB/c) was performed. We employed 200,000 sorted Tregs (>98% purity by CD4 + FoxP3 + selection from C57BL/6-FoxP3 RFP reporter mice) from donor unexpanded, IL-2 LD , or TL1A-Ig+IL-2 LD treated mice combined with 1.0 x10 6 T cells. As anticipated, transfer 200,000 TL1A-Ig+IL-2 LD stimulated Tregs ameliorated acute GVHD ( Fig. 1C ). Remarkably, lower GVHD clinical scores were obtained using the same number of IL-2 LD only expanded Tregs compared with TL1A-Ig+IL-2 LD stimulated Tregs ( Fig. 1C ). Moreover, early post-transplant, higher LN and splenic CD4/CD8 ratios were detected in aHSCT recipients treated with IL-2 LD expanded Tregs vs. TL1A-Ig+IL-2 LD ( Fig. 1D ). CONCLUSION: Our donor TL1A-Ig+IL-2 LD Treg expansion protocol promotes a more activated/differentiated and proliferative phenotype versus IL-2 LD stimulation alone. This finding may have accounted for their initial effectiveness - but less efficient long-term GVHD amelioration compared to IL-2 LD only stimulated Tregs. Multiple variables are associated with the application of Tregs for therapy including numbers, persistence, and suppressive capacity. Our findings suggest a rationale that one-pathway and / or two-pathway stimulated Tregs may be beneficial for use in aHSCT recipients dependent on whether there is a perceived need for prolonged Treg presence and the stage of GVHD.
