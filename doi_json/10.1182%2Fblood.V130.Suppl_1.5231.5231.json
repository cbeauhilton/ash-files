    "abstract_text": "Background Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is divided into Germinal center B-cell like (GCB) subtype and non-GCB by the Hans algorithm and non-GCB is known to be associated with unfavorable prognosis. Therefore, we tried to compare the difference of clinical parameters between GCB and non-GCB DLBCL subtypes. Methods We retrospectively analyzed DLBCL patients in the Asan Medical Center's lymphoma database from January 2001 to December 2014. We selected 796 patients who received first line R-CHOP chemotherapy and whose cell-of-origin can be classified by the Hans algorithm. Results Among the 796 patients, 261 (32.8%) were in the GCB subtype and 535 (67.2%) were in the non-GCB group by the Hans algorithm. ECOG PS\u22652, increased \u03b22M (\u03b2 2 -microglobulin), increased LDH, Ann Arbor stage 3-4, high NCCN IPI and GELTAMO IPI stage were associated with non-GCB type. There was borderline significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) for patients in the GCB and non-GCB cohorts (p=.07). Conclusions Non-GCB subtype DLBCL had relatively unfavorable prognostic factors than GCB DLBCL. Such as ECOG PS\u22652, increased \u03b22M (\u03b2 2 -microglobulin), increased LDH, Ann Arbor stage 3-4, high NCCN IPI and GELTAMO IPI stage were more distributed in non-GCB DLBCL.
