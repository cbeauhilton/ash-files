    "abstract_text": "Clinical progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by gradual reduction of the ratio T/B cells, along with immune cell dysfunction due, at least in part, to T cell defects, such as decreased expression of CD40L and reduced signaling via the TCR CD3. This compromise the ability of T cells to respond and to eliminate leukemic cell from CLL patients. Enhanced activation of either allogenic or autologous T cells can drive the death of CLL cells in vitro and in human subjects. Changes in microRNAs expression also characterize clinical progression of CLL with a strong decrease of miR-181b/a and miR-130a associated with the more aggressive phase of the disease. The miR-181b targets anti-apoptotic proteins, such as BCL-2 and MCL1 and its expression correlates with those protein levels in CLL. In this study we demonstrate that the expression of those microRNAs in CLL-B cells, are regulated by T cells. We co-cultured allogenic pure CLL-B cells with either activated (CD2, CD3 and CD28 antibodies, used to mimic antigen-presenting cells) or not activated CD4+ T cells from healthy donors. We observed a significant increase of mir-181b/a and miR-130a expression in CLL B-cells after co-culture with activated CD4 + T cells in 8 out of 11 cases. A significant increase of these miRs was also determined in purified CLL B-cells after 4 days activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CLL patients, even if in minor rate. By the use of specific antibodies, co-culture with Hela CD40 expressing cells and transwell experiments, we established that this effect is a T/B contact-dependent signaling mediated through CD40L-CD40 interaction. We determine that increased expression of the 3 miRs occurs at the transcriptional level. Since the expression of miR-181b showed the most significant variation in previous experiments it was selected for further analyses. We next investigated the in vivo role of the miR-181b in highly immunodeficient mice. The CLL cell line, MEC-01, infected with either the LV-miR-181b_coGFP or the LV-CTRL_coGFP was intravenously inoculated in NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ (NSG) mice. Mice were sacrificed after 4 weeks and assayed for percentage of GFP + cells in bone marrow and spleen compartments. The miR-181b did not show any specific effect into the leukemic clone. However when the same cells were inoculated in an environment hosting mature T cells, miR-181b consistently influences the death of leukemic cells (Fig 1B), suggesting that T cells are required to potentiate the apoptotic role of this miRNA. To explain what we observed in vivo , we mixed in vitro MEC-01 infected with either the LV-miR-181b or the LV-CTRL and CD8+ T cells from healthy donors. After few hours of contact T cells showed stronger cytotoxic effect on MEC-01 carrying miR-181b as compared to the control. Mixed lymphocyte reaction CD40L-activated CLL and T cells is used to generate effector CTLs. Therefore we grew T cell with CD40L-activated MEC-01 in which the expression of miR-181b was either shut down by lentiviral vector or unchanged as control. After one week, we monitored by cytofluorimetry the CD38 surface marker on T cells since its expression has been associated with more active CTLs and, by ELISA, the release of IL-10, the inhibitor of the potent inducer of CTLs INF-g. We demonstrate that activated MEC-01 with higher expression of miR-181b leads to an increase of the cell number expressing CD38 and this was accompanied by a reduced release of IL-10 from B cells through down-regulation of c-FOS, which we show to be target of the miR-181b and to promote the transcription of the IL-10. In conclusion, our data suggest a role of the miR-181b in the immune response against CLL-B cells. We show that an efficient activation of CD4 + T cells through CD3-complex pathway and a right CD40L-CD40 interaction lead to a significant increase of the some miRNAs deregulated over the progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, namely miR-181b. This miRNA potentiates the cytotoxicity of T cells favoring the killing of the leukemic clone. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
