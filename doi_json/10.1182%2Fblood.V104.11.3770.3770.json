    "abstract_text": "Beta-thalassemia is a inherited hemoglobin disorder characterized by absent or reduced synthesis of the b globin chains. The pathophysiology and the severity of b-thalassemias reflect the degree of globin chain imbalance and the excess of free a globin chains that precipitate and cause oxidative damage in red cell precursors inducing their premature destruction in the bone marrow (ineffective erythropoiesis). Although the phenotype of b thalassemias can be modified by inherited factors such as different number of a globin genes or increased fetal hemoglobin production, other mechanisms appear to be involved. Recently, a protein, named alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP), that acts as a molecular chaperone specifically for free a globin chains, preventing their precipitation in red cell precursors, has been identified. To establish whether AHSP might have a role in modifying the clinical outcome of b thalassemias, we have analyzed the AHSP gene in 70 Caucasian b thalassaemic subjects: 26 patients with b\u00b0/b\u00b0 genotype (Thalassaemia Major),24 patients with Thalassemia Intermedia (b\u00b0/b+ or b+/b+) and 20 patients with a Thalassaemia Intermedia phenotype but with only one mutation in the b globin gene, a normal a globin genotype and no other causes of anemia. In all the subjects, we have performed Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) of the three exons and the direct genomic sequencing of coding and noncoding regions (~ 1.5 kb) of AHSP gene. No mutations able to modify the structure or function of AHSP have been found, however we identified eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanned along the whole gene that segregate in four different aplotypes. To evaluate a possible relationship between a particular aplotype and b thalassemia severity, the allele frequency of each single aplotype in the tree groups has been established and compared to that of 33 Caucasian normal controls: no statistically significant association has been proved. Even though the loss of AHSP aggravates the b thalassaemia phenotype in mice, in Thalassemic Caucasian population the AHSP apparently doesn\u2019t make changes in the clinical severity of b thalassemia confirming the results recently found in Thai population.",
