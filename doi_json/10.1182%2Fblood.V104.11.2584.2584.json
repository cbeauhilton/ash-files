    "abstract_text": "While atherosclerosis has been suggested as a risk factor for VTE, previously identified mechanisms for atherosclerosis and VTE differ dramatically. Objectives : To compare (a) VTE-free survival and (b) observed vs. expected number of VTE events, among adult patients with and without aortic atherosclerosis. Design/Setting : Population-based prospective cohort study in Olmsted County, MN. Patients : Age- and sex-stratified random sample of the adult (\u226545 years old) Olmsted County population identified over the three-year period, 1993\u20131995 (n=573), performed as part of the Stroke Prevention: Assessment of Risk in the Community ( SPARC ) study. Measurements : The SPARC study included a baseline clinical evaluation (interviews, review of medical records), blood pressure measurements, blood sampling, and transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ). The Risk Factors for VTE in the Community study identified all incident VTE among Olmsted County residents over the 32-year period, 1966\u20131997, from which expected VTE events by age and sex were calculated. Results : Over 2830 person-years of follow-up, 12 SPARC patients developed VTE (7 idiopathic). The 4-year VTE-free survival was 99% and 98% for those with and those without any TEE-detected aortic atherosclerosis. Adjusting for age in a Cox proportional hazards model, lack of aortic atherosclerosis was significantly associated with subsequent VTE (p=0.01). Among the 276 patients without atherosclerosis observed for 1423 person-years, 7 VTE were observed compared to 2.6 expected (RR=2.7, 95%CI: 1.1, 5.6). Among the 291 patients with atherosclerosis (plaque \u22652mm), 4 VTE were observed compared to 5.8 expected (RR=0.7, 95%CI: 0.2, 1.8). Conclusions : Atherosclerosis is not a risk factor for incident VTE.",
