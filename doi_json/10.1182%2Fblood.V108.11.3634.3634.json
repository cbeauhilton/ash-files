    "abstract_text": "Chromosomal rearrangements of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRA ) gene on 4q12 have been described in a subset of patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome/chronic eosinophilic leukemia (IHES/CEL). The most common, found in 12\u201317% of CEL patients, is the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion, resulting from a cytogenetically invisible deletion on 4q12 ( Cools et al., NEJM  2003 ; 348 : 1201 ; Griffin et al., PNAS  2003 ; 100 : 7830 ). FIP1L1-PDGFRA + CEL patients have an excellent response to low-dose imatinib therapy, often accompanied by complete molecular remission ( Pardanani et al., Leuk. Res.  2006 ; 30 : 965 ). Additional fusion partners of PDGFRA include KIF5B and CDK5RAP2 in CEL, and BCR in atypical chronic myeloid leukemia with eosinophilia and t(4;22)(q12;q11) ( Baxter et al., Hum. Mol. Genet.  2002 ; 11 : 1391 ). However, the oncogenic activity and imatinib responsiveness of these other activated PDGFRA alleles are unknown. In this study, we assessed the imatinib sensitivity of BCR-PDGFR\u03b1 and FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 in hematopoietic cell lines, and compared their leukemogenic activity in a mouse retroviral bone marrow transduction/transplantation model. Like FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1, BCR-PDGFR\u03b1 transformed Ba/F3 cells to become independent of IL-3 for survival and growth. In the absence of IL-3, FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1-expressing Ba/F3 cells were 30-fold more sensitive to imatinib than BCR-PDGFR\u03b1 (IC50 = 3 nM vs. 90 nM) for inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. A FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 N659D mutant ( Cools et al., Cancer Cell  2003 ; 3 : 459 ) was relatively resistant to imatinib (IC50 = 200 nM), while the corresponding BCR-PDGFR\u03b1 N659D mutant displayed increased imatinib resistance (IC50 > 2 \u03bcM). Inhibition of cellular proliferation correlated with decreased tyrosyl phosphorylation of the respective fusion kinase and of the downstream substrate PLC\u03b31. In leukemogenesis experiments, recipients of bone marrow transduced with retrovirus expressing either FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 or BCR-PDGFR\u03b1 developed fatal myeloproliferative disease, with similar median and overall survival. This was accompanied by significant eosinophilia, relative to the disease induced by BCR-ABL in this model system ( Li et al., Blood  2001 ; 97 : 1442 ). Treatment of recipients of FIP1L1-PDGFRA - or BCR-PDGFRA -transduced marrow with imatinib (125 mg/kg/day by oral gavage for 20 days) suppressed leukocytosis and prolonged their survival. These results suggest that distinct signaling pathways activated by leukemogenic PDGFR\u03b1 fusions in hematopoietic progenitors induce eosinophila in vivo. However, different fusion partners of PDGFR\u03b1 can significantly influence the sensitivity of the fusion kinase to imatinib treatment."
