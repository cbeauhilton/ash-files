    "abstract_text": "Background: Cancer diagnosis and treatment are important risk factors for developing clinical depression. Validated tools for screening distress and depression, such as Cancer Distress Thermometer (DT) and PHQ9 (Patient Health Questionnaire), are underutilized, despite endorsement by NCCN and Institute of Medicine. We investigated patient and treatment characteristics as well as patient endorsement of depression or anhedonia to predict those at risk of having depression. Methods: The PHQ9 and/or DT were administered prospectively to patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) before they started antineoplastic therapy at Mayo Clinic in Florida. Patient endorsement of depression or anhedonia was collected from the current visit information survey. Patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, chronic medication burden, Charlson comorbidity index, living situation, clinic/hospital visit burden in the month prior to screening and number of psychiatric medications for every patient were recorded. Intergroup comparison of categorical and continuous variables was done by Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, respectively. Linear or logistic regression models were used to compare PHQ9 score with DT (continuous) or endorsing depression or anhedonia (categorical) respectively. Multivariate models were constructed using the stepwise selection technique using all potential variables in the models. All analyses were completed using SAS v9.3. Results: Final analysis included 246 patients with a median age at diagnosis 64.5 (range: 18-94) years, diagnosed between 6/30/93-10/9/14 and screened between 1/13/11-2/13/15. PHQ9 score of \u22659 and DT score \u22655 suggested a high risk of depression and distress, respectively, as per published literature. Patient characteristics at time of survey and analysis are noted in table 1. PHQ9, DT and answers to two questions about depression and anhedonia were available on 129, 129 and 246 patients, respectively. 63% of patients were chemotherapy na\u00efve. In multivariate analysis, PHQ9 score \u22659 was associated with living alone (p=0.003) (Fig.1a) and non-White race (p=0.043) (Fig.1b), while a DT score \u22655 was associated with being currently married (p=0.048) and female gender (p=0.02). The only characteristic significant on univariate but not on multivariate analysis being chemotherapy naive, associated with a DT score \u22655 (p=0.049). Answering \"no\" to both the questions regarding depression or anhedonia was significantly associated with a low score on PHQ9 (p=0.007). Age at diagnosis, Charlson comorbidity score, chronic medication or visit burden, daily psychiatric medication use or type of malignancy were not associated with scores on any screen. Conclusions: Causes of depression in patients with HM have not been fully explored. We validated previously known risk factors for depression, such as living alone. We also reported for the first time that non-White race independently predicts depression in these patients. Female patients and those currently married are at a higher risk of psychological distress, possibly due to fear of abandoning family. We also found that simply asking a patient two questions about feelings of depression or anhedonia significantly correlates with the well-established PHQ9. Our analysis provides simple tools and reveals at-risk patient subgroups with HM where depression and distress screening should be aggressively instituted for better resource utilization and survivorship.
