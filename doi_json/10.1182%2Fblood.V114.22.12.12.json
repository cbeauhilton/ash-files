    "abstract_text": "Abstract 12 Background: Recently, in genome-wide analyses of DNA copy number abnormalities using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, genetic alterations targeting PAX5 were identified in over 30% of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases (Mullighan et al. Nature 2008). However, so far, the occurrence of PAX5 alterations and their clinical correlation has not been investigated in adults with BCR-ABL1 -positive ALL. Aim: To characterize the rearrangements on 9p involving PAX5 and their clinical significance in adult BCR-ABL1 -positive ALL. Patients and Methods: Eighty-nine patients with de novo adult BCR-ABL1 -positive ALL were enrolled into institutional (n = 15) or Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell'Adulto Acute Leukemia Working Party (n = 74) clinical trials and after obtaining informed consent their genome was analyzed by SNP arrays (Affymetrix 250K NspI and SNP 6.0), FISH, genomic PCR and resequencing. Results: By SNP array analysis we identified a loss of PAX5 in 29 patients (33%). In all cases the deletion was hemizygous. Four patterns of PAX5 deletion were observed: 1) focal deletion involving only the PAX5 gene in one case (3%); 2) deletions involving only a portion of PAX5 and both telomeric and centromeric genes in 11 cases (38%) with a median size of 310 kb (range: 101 kb-16,395 kb); 3) broader deletions involving the entire PAX5 locus and a variable number of flanking genes in 10 patients (34%) with a median size of 1,999 kb (range: 567 kb-1,208 kb); 4) deletion of all chromosome 9 or 9p in 7 patients (24%). These deletions may result in either PAX5 haploinsufficiency or expression of PAX5 alleles with impaired DNA-binding or transcriptional activation activity. In one patient the deletion of PAX5 involved only a subset of exons (exons 2-6) resulting in an alternative transcript encoding a prematurely truncated protein lacking key PAX5 functional domains. To investigate the consequences of genomic PAX5 alteration, quantitative PCR (q-PCR) was used, demonstrating that genomic alterations on 9p13.2 lead to a significant down-modulation at the transcript level of Pax5. Furthermore, both normal and deleted PAX5 subgroups were investigated for point mutations by sequencing analysis but we did not found nucleotide substitutions, suggesting that deletions are the main mechanism of inactivation of PAX5 in BCR-ABL1 positive ALL. However, when we investigated the association of PAX5 deletions with clinical outcome, no association with PAX5 status was detected (overall survival: p=0.3294; disease free-survival,DFS: p=0.9249 and cumulative incidence of relapse, CIR: p=0.945), suggesting that PAX5 deletions are not associated with outcome. Twenty-three patients (26%) had deletion of both PAX5 and IKZF1 , encoding for the transcription factor Ikaros. We assessed the contribution of both PAX5 and IKZF1 alterations on clinical outcome finding out that the occurrence of both normal PAX5 and IKZF1 loss is associated with a shorter DFS (p=0.04) and higher CIR cumulative incidence of relapse in comparison to patients with both normal IKZF1 and PAX5 (p = 0.009). These results were confirmed by multivariate analysis. Conclusion: PAX5 deletions are frequent events in adult BCR-ABL1 positive ALL and are often associated with IKZF1 loss. The genomic status of both PAX5 and IKZF1 can be useful to identify at diagnosis groups of patients with worse prognosis.
