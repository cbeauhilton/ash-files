    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4432 Background: The incidence of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), reported from some population based registries, varies significantly. CML is known as age-dependent disease, so population age structure may strongly influent on the data. For international comparisons several systems for age-standardization are using in epidemiological studies. We conducted our retrospective study to reveal differences in CML incidence rates on the basis of calculation \u2013 crude or age-adjusted according to different population standards in St. Petersburg and Leningrad region. Methods: In 2005 the database of Ph- and/or bcr-abl- positive CML patients (pts) was conducted in St. Petersburg and Leningrad region. Since then the data from all newly diagnosed CML patients were included prospectively on population basis. The database was updated at least bi-annually. The data were obtained from hematologists, as general practitioners and private physicians are not licensed to treat oncohematological disorders. The data were double checked from the list of Imatinib distribution (the only drug reimbursed for first line treatment). To calculate crude CML incidence rate we use the data of the general census of the population in Russia in 2010 (the whole population of our region is 6596434 with population in age 15 and above 5821133). For age-adjusted CML incidence rate we use three of currently existing standards: The Segi (\u201cWorld\u201d), The Scandinavian (\u201cEuropean\u201d) and the WHO standard (based on world average population between 2000\u20132025). Results: There are 258 (242 in chronic, 9 in accelerated and 7 in blastic phases) CML adult (15 years and above) pts, registered during 2006\u20132011. The median age is 53 years (48,5 and 55,5 years for men and women respectively). Sokal score was evaluable in 209 pts. It is low in 37%, intermediate in 35% and high in 28% pts. The crude CML incidence rate is slightly higher in men than in women with ratio 1,2:1. Mean annual crude CML incidence rate was 0,65 per 100 000 whole population of Saint Petersburg and Leningrad region, but it was 0,74 in adult population (15 years old and above). Mean annual CML incidence rates in the same age groups were slightly higher in all three standardized systems: 0,94 in Segi, 0,84 in Scandinavian and 0,88 in WHO standard populations. CML incidence rates in all age groups are presented in the table 1 . CML incidence rate was lowest in young pts. It was unexpectedly very low in senior pts. CML incidence rates nearly for all age groups were slightly higher in St. Petersburg than in the Leningrad region. The majority of pts (98%) were treated with Imatinib (93% first or second line) or other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (5% first line-in international clinical trials, 18% after Imatinib failure or intolerance). Stem cell transplantation was performed only in 8/258 (3%) pts. Only 25235 (7,5%) evaluable pts progressed from chronic to advanced phases. Only 29/258 (11%) pts dead mostly due to CML (21 CML related deaths were reported). Estimated 5 years overall survival is 91,5%. Mean annual overall CML pts death rate was 1,9% (mean annual death rate between 2006\u20132010 in whole population of our region was 1,6%). Mean pts accumulated very fast - annual CML prevalence increasing rate between 2005\u20132011 was more than 14% (Picture 1). Conclusions: CML incidence both crude and age-adjusted in our population based registry is nearly the same in young and middle age, but much lower in senior (65 years and above) pts groups in comparison with published data from other registries which probably represents peculiarities of health system rather than real incidence. In the tyrosine kinase inhibitors era CML patients death rate is very low (nearly the same as in whole population) and CML pts is accumulated very fast in our region. Tab. 1.
