    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) reside in specific peri-vascular niches in the bone marrow (BM). We have shown interactions with the inflammatory vascular adhesion molecule E-(endothelial)-selectin awakens HSC (Nat Med 2012). We now report that BM vascular cell-surface E-selectin expression is strongly upregulated during HSC mobilization regimens raising the question of a role for endothelial E-selectin in HSC transplant outcome. G-CSF was administered to cohorts of E gene-deleted or wildtype C57BL/6 mice together with E-selectin antagonist Uproleselan (Upro, GMI-1271). We found absence (Sele -/- mice) or therapeutic blockade (Upro) of E-selectin alone in steady-state hosts did not alter levels of circulating peripheral blood (PB) HSC. In contrast absence or therapeutic blockade of E-selectin strongly synergized with mobilizing regimens such as G-CSF or cyclophosphamide+G-CSF by boosting long-term engraftment and reconstitution potential of mobilized blood. The effect was pronounced boosting reconstitution potential over G-CSF-alone-mobilized blood 24-fold (<p=0.0001; analyzed by Poisson Statistics following serial-dilution long-term competitive-reconstitution [LT-CR] transplantation assays of 4 PB dilutions). Despite the increased reconstitution potential no change in mobilized phenotypic HSC nor in colony forming cell numbers were observed. Together these results suggest the significant 24-fold boost in peripheral blood reconstitution potential induced by Upro + G-CSF is due to increases in HSC potency alone. Two hypotheses may explain how therapeutic E-selectin-blockade promotes potency of mobilized HSC; Dampening of inflammatory activation at the BM niche induced by G-CSF that drive HSC exhaustion, Directly preventing adhesion-mediated HSC commitment during trans-endothelial transmigration from BM into blood. To investigate inflammatory mediator profiles in the BM, cohorts of mice were administered saline control or G-CSF \u00b1 Upro (125ug/kg G-CSF, 40mg/kg Upro BiD for 3 days) then femoral BM fluids flushed for cytokine profiling (LegendPlex). As anticipated, G-CSF administration significantly increased concentration of classic pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-23, IFN-\u03b2) in BM associated with HSC activation and loss of quiescence in the BM. No similar boost in inflammatory mediators was observed in BM from mobilized mice co-administered Upro. Similarly pronounced metabolic changes could be observed in BM HSC following in vivo G-CSF administration (such as a significant doubling in HSC Mitochondrial Membrane potential [MOMP] suggesting increased energy demands with HSC activation) was similarly reversed in vivo by Upro co-administration. Together these results suggest blockade of E-selectin on activated vasculature significantly dampens BM HSC activation following G-CSF administration - potentially shielding HSC self-renewal potential. Next we investigated whether the transient interactions with endothelial E-selectin during trans-endothelial transmigration from BM into blood also directly affects HSC potency. BM HSPC harvested from G-CSF plus Upro-treated mice were loaded in transwells pre-coated with recombinant adhesion molecules (P-selectin, E-selectin and CD14-Fc as control) and HSC induced to transmigrate through coated pores towards CXCL12 gradient. After 3hr cell numbers were enumerated and exactly 100 transmigrated HSC from each well transplanted/recipient in a LT-CR transplant assay. Analysis of % CD45.2+ donor HSC reconstitution confirmed a pronounced 10-fold drop in reconstitution potential of HSC transmigrated through E-selectin compared to P-selectin or control coated transwells (p=0.0027) confirming that transient adhesive interactions with E-selectin, such as would occur on activated vasculature during HSC transmigration from BM into the blood, strongly impact subsequent HSC reconstitution upon transplantation. In summary, transient interactions between intravasating HSC with E-selectin on BM vasculature inadvertently compromises reconstitution potential of up to 96% of conventionally harvested HSC, indicating an unexpected disadvantage with current HSC harvesting procedures. These studies also point the way forward to a simple remedy, administration of E-selectin antagonist (Upro) together with G-CSF during HSC mobilization, to improve HSC transplant outcomes.
