    "abstract_text": "Recent successes and FDA approvals of CD19 redirected chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CART19) therapy have been achieved in pivotal clinical trials in patients with B cell malignancies. However, durable response rates in non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma (B-NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are low. Tumor-associated macrophages have emerged as key mediators of tumor-induced CART cell immunosuppression. Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (Axl-RTK) is overexpressed in various human cancers including B-NHL or CLL and correlates with poor overall survival. Thus, several Axl-RTK inhibitors are currently being investigated in clinical trials. We have previously reported that the Axl-RTK inhibitor TP-0903 modulates CART19 function by Th1 polarization. Moreover, we observed a significant reduction in myeloid-derived cytokines in preclinical models. This led us to hypothesize that Axl-RTK inhibition also modulates monocytes which in turn affects CART function. To test our hypothesis, we interrogated the interactions between Axl-RTK inhibition, monocytes, and CART. First, we isolated CD14 + monocytes from peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors by magnetic negative selection. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a robust Axl expression on monocytes (Fig.1A). Monocytes were maintained in ImmunoCult Macrophage Medium (STEMCELL Technologies) and differentiated with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-\u03b3 for M1-type and interleukin (IL)-4 for M2-type macrophages. After confirming the macrophage phenotypes, cells were assessed for Axl expression. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that M2-type macrophages expressed higher Axl compared to M1 macrophages (Fig.1B). Then, we treated PBMCs from healthy donors with TP-0903 for 24 hours to determine the specific cell types affected by Axl-RTK inhibition. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that monocytes were significantly inhibited by TP-0903 compared to B cells or T cells (Fig.1C). Having demonstrated that TP-0903 strongly suppresses monocytes and that M2-type macrophages express Axl on their surface, we then performed a cytotoxicity assay against CD19 + mantle cell lymphoma cell line, JeKo-1, to study the impact of Axl-RTK inhibition on monocyte-induced CART suppression. We used CART19 generated in our laboratory (FMC63-41BB\u03b6). CART19, JeKo-1, and M2-type macrophages were co-cultured at 1:2:1 ratio and incubated for 3 days. The data revealed that M2-type macrophages strongly suppress CART19 killing (Fig.1D) which could be overcome with TP-0903 (Fig.1E). Next we studied monocyte-induced CART19 suppression with antigen-specific proliferation. CART19, JeKo-1, and monocytes were co-cultured at 1:5:1 ratio and incubated for 5 days. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that in the presence of monocytes, antigen-specific proliferation of CART19 was significantly suppressed, which was reversed in the presence of TP-0903 (Fig.1F). To assess how Axl inhibition modulates myeloid cell-derived cytokines/chemokines, we performed Multiplex (Millipore-Sigma) with the supernatants obtained from these co-culture assays. The presence of monocytes resulted in a significant increase in IL-17a, IL-6, IL-1 receptor agonist, IL-1\u03b2, and soluble CD40 ligand. However, Axl-RTK inhibition resulted in selective reduction of those cytokines/chemokines (Fig.1G) while preserving other effector cytokines. Finally, we tested whether Axl-RTK inhibition with TP-0903 could overcome the negative effects of monocytes in vivo . Here, immunocompromised NSG mice were injected with 1x10 6 luciferase + JeKo-1 cells intravenously. Ten days later, mice were injected with freshly isolated monocytes derived from a healthy donor. Two weeks after JeKo-1 inoculation, tumor burden was assessed with bioluminescence imaging. Mice were then randomized according to the tumor burden to receive 0.5x10 6 CART19 as a monotherapy or in combination with 20 mg/kg/day of oral TP-0903. The combination therapy resulted in superior anti-tumor effects and overall survival compared to CART19 monotherapy (Fig.1H-I). In summary, Axl-RTK inhibition with TP-0903 demonstrates a direct suppression of inhibitory monocytes, which in turn enhances CART cell function. Our findings support the strategy of further refining and testing the novel and potent combination of Axl-RTK inhibition and CART cell therapy for the treatment of B cell malignancies.
