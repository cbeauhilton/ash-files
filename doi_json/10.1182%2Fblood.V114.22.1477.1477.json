They are therefore highly promising source of various cells/tissues in the regenerative medicine. The current protocols, however, remain to be optimized for the induction of the cells/tissues required. We have recently reported that the lentiviral transduction of TAL1/SCL gene to ES cells derived from the common marmoset, a small nonhuman primate, enables efficient differentiation into hematopoietic progenitor cells even in the absence of stromal cells (Kurita et al. Stem Cells. 24 :2014-22, 2006). Such culture condition without any stromal cells is considered to facilitate clinical application of ES cell-derived cell/tissues therapy in the regenerative medicine. The present study addressed whether the strategy is also effective in human ES cells. First, we determined optimal culture conditions to induce multilineage hematopoietic differentiation in a human ES cell line, khES-1, kindly provided by Dr. Nakatsuji, Kyoto University, Japan, as assessed by the expression of Brachyury, Flk1 and CD34. We found that the addition of BMP4 and VEGF augmented hematopoietic differentiation of embryoid bodies, and determined optimal concentrations of the cytokines. We established four human ES cell lines stably expressing TAL1/SCL gene by lentiviral transduction. The TAL1/SCL transduction further increased the hematopoietic differentiation under the optimal culture condition as assessed by the expression of CD34, CD235a and CD133. We also observed increased number of hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from two of the TAL1/SCL expressing human ES cell lines by colony-forming assays. Hematopoietic differentiation of the TAL1/SCL expressing ES cells in vivo is also being investigated by transplantation into irradiated immune deficient mice. These results suggest that the combination of optimal culture conditions and lentiviral TAL1/SCL gene transduction is a highly effective strategy to obtain hematopoietic stem cells from human ES cells in the absence of any stromal cells.
