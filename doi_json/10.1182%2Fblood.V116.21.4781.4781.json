    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4781 Introduction: The SOX (Sry-related HMG box) genes belong to a family of transcription factors containing a High-Mobility-Group box domain. In an initial screen of SOX genes in human leukemias, SOX7 is uniquely down-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myelogenous leukemia but up-regulated in most cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The observation led to the proposition that SOX7 may play a role in lineage differentiation in hematopoiesis. In this study, we examined SOX7 expression in human umbilical cord blood (UCB) with a view to understand its role in hematopoietic lineage specification. Methods: Mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated from UCB and fractionated into CD34 + , CD34 - , CD34 + CD38 + and CD34 + CD38 - populations by immunomagnetic selection and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). 0.1\u20130.4 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + UCB cells were transplanted intravenously into sub-lethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice with or without prior anti-CD122 antibody injection. Donor engraftment was assessed after 7\u20138 weeks and engrafting human cells were sorted for CD34 + , CD33 + , CD19 + expression. CD34 + UCB cells were also plated in colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. SOX7 expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR). Results: The relative SOX7 expression in CD34 + and CD34 + CD38 - UCB cells was 9.15\u00b12.18 and 4.53\u00b11.09 fold higher than in CD34 - (P=0.0001) and CD34 + CD38 + (P=0.014) respectively. SOX7 expression in CD34 + cells (arbitrarily set as 1.0) was down-regulated upon differentiation in CFU assay (CFU-GM/G: 0.09\u00b10.06 fold, P=0.007; BFU-E: 0.05\u00b10.03 fold, P=0.003). CD34 + cells engrafted into NOD/SCID mice as enumerated by human CD45 + cells in mouse BM (with anti-CD122: 51\u00b16.3%; without anti-CD122: 28\u00b19%; p=0.017) and gave rise to predominantly B-lymphoid (CD19 + ) (53.1\u00b18.18%) and to a less extent myeloid (CD33 + ) (2.9\u00b10.54%) differentiated cells. Prior injection with anti-CD122 antibody had no effect on lineage differentiation and the results were pooled. When SOX7 expression in engrafting myeloid and B-lymphoid differentiated cells (arbitrarily set as 1.0) were compared, it was significantly down-regulated in the myeloid series (0.28\u00b10.08 fold, p = 0.036). Conclusion SOX7 is selectively expressed in human HSC from UCB. It is preferentially down-regulated during myeloid differentiation both in-vivo and in-vitro . The function of SOX7 during lineage specification and its link to myeloid malignancies is currently investigated in our laboratory.
