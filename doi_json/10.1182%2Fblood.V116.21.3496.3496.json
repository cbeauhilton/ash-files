    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3496 Introduction: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allogeneic HSCT) has found entrance into treatment of patients (patients) with poor-risk T-cell malignancies, but post-transplant relapse rates of ~30% were reported (Marks et al. Blood 2009). Improvement of the pre-transplant remission status in relapsed/refractory disease might lead to better outcomes. Nelarabine - a novel purine antimetabolite - has been approved by the FDA in 2005 as salvage approach for patients with T-cell malignancies, but data on pre-transplant use are limited (Goekbuget et al. ASH Annual Meeting 2005). Patients/Methods: Aiming to estimate its clinical applicability and efficacy in the pre-transplant period, we evaluated its use in 8 patients (5 males, 3 females; 22\u201356 years) with precursor/mature T-cell neoplasms who had failed to \u22652 previous conventional/intensified chemotherapy regimens (including a history of autologous/allogeneic HSCT in 2 patients) and were consequently proceeded to allogeneic HSCT (in 6 cases the 1 st , in 2 cases the 2 nd allogeneic HSCT). Five had T-ALL (1 pre-T-, 3 cortical, 1 mature), 3 had mature T-cell lymphomas (angioimmunoblastic lymphoma, n=1; peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, n=2), all with bone marrow involvement. Patients entered conventional chemotherapy in 6 cases at the 1 st manifestation of disease, in 2 cases at the 1 st relapse. Following conventional chemotherapy, 5 patients developed an early relapse, while 2 patients were refractory to treatment; one patient was minimal residual disease (MRD) positive as assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry. Therefore, all 8 patients were offered an allogeneic HSCT (1 st allogeneic HSCT: n=6; 2 nd allogeneic HSCT: n=2) with pre-treatment with nelarabine. The median interval from the last chemotherapy to 1 st nelarabine administration was 8 weeks (range, 1\u2013 252 weeks). Nelarabine (1,500 mg/m 2 i.v.) was administrated on days 1, 3, and 5 at a median of 11 weeks (range, 2\u201353 weeks) before allogeneic HSCT. Three patients received a 2 nd cycle of nelarabine after a median of 4 weeks (range, 2\u20139 weeks) from the 1 st . Six patients had unrelated (HLA-match, n=4; mismatch, n=2) and 2 patients matched related donors. Most patients received myeloablative conditioning (TBI, 12 Gy; cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg; n=3; treosulfan 36 g/m 2 ; etoposide 30 mg/kg; cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg; n=4). In the 8 th patient who had already received 2 courses of nelarabine, a 3 rd nelarabine application was incorporated as pre-phase into reduced-intensity conditioning (nelarabine 2 \u00d7 1,500 mg/m 2 ; fludarabine 90 mg/m 2 ; TBI 8 Gy). Results: i) Pre-transplant application of nelarabine: Immediate neurotoxicity was observed in 1 patient ( grand mal seizure day +3 after the last nelarabine administration). Grade II hematotoxicity was observed in 3/8 patients. There were no treatment-related deaths. Seven of 8 patients showed response to nelarabine (86%; CR, n=5; PR, n=2) after a median of 4 weeks (1 \u2013 35 days) from the 1 st cycle. One patient had stable disease (SD). ii) Peri-/post-transplant period: there were no uncommon adverse events. After HSCT, prolonged leukocytopenia (WBC 20 days) and thrombocytopenia (thrombocytes 30 days) were observed in 3 and 5 patients, respectively. At the 1 st post-transplant bone marrow control, 3 patients with residual disease (PR or SD) prior to allogeneic HSCT achieved CR, and all other patients maintained CR. Acute (grade II) and chronic GvHD developed in 2/8 (25%) and in 2/6 (33%) patients, respectively; there was no case of grade III-IV acute GvHD. At a median follow up of 9 months (range, 1\u201324), 3 patients had died (38%; relapse, n=1, t-AML, n=1; transplant-related toxicity, n=1). All 5 patients being alive were in CR; 4 patients required no further treatment, and one patient received donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) due to mixed chimerism. Conclusions: Nelarabine improves pre-transplant remission in patients with relapsed/refractory T-cell neoplasms and seems to be well tolerated immediately before allogeneic HSCT even in heavily pre-treated patients. The compound might be used as pre-phase or be incorporated into conditioning for allogeneic HSCT which should be further evaluated. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
