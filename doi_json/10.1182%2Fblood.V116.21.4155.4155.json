    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4155 Beyond the conventional criteria of lymphoma classification (integrated clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, and molecular features) additional markers are still required for a more precise differential diagnosis and a better understanding of lymphoma pathogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are non-coding small RNAs that play an important role in gene expression regulation, contributing to cell differentiation and tumorigenesis. Specifically, miRNAs have been already described to play a relevant role in B cell differentiation, and in some cases proposed to constitute lymphoma-type specific markers and possible therapeutic targets. We explore the potential diagnostic application of miRNA expression in a large series of 147 cases including all B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) major types and appropriate controls. As an example of a practical application, data were also used to identify miRNAs differentially expressed when comparing Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) and Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) in paraffin-embedded samples. Each lymphoma type (BL, CLL, DLBCL, FL, MCL, MZL/MALT, NMZL and SMZL) was compared to the whole series of NHL by Significant Analysis of Microarray (SAM) method. The analysis identified a set of 128 characteristic miRNAs (FDR1.5 log2). All lymphoma types were characterized by specific miRNA signatures, reflecting cell of origin and/or discrete oncogene alterations. Of interest is also the comparison with reactive lymphoid tissues, since it revealed a specific B-cell lymphoma miRNA profile, which includes a cluster of downregulated miRNAs, such as let7 family, miR-1 and miR-200 family. Burkitt Lymphoma was also directly compared to DLBCL, and 43 miRNA selected by SAM analysis were studied in a new series of 28 BL and 43 DLBCL samples using quantitative RT-PCRIn this second step, the differential expression of a set of 19 miRNAs was confirmed between BL and DLBCL. (FDR < 0.05 after t-test (limma)). These findings expand the potential diagnostic markers in lymphoma diagnosis and provide useful information on lymphoma pathogenesis.
