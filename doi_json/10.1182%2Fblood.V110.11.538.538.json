    "abstract_text": "JAK2 is the most common mutated gene in bcr-abl -negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) making it an attractive target for drug discovery. Pre-clinical studies have shown that inhibition of JAK2 signaling pathways confer therapeutic benefits in animal models of MPD. We describe here SB1518, a potent, selective and orally active inhibitor of JAK2 with therapeutic potential for the treatment of MPDs. SB1518 is a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor of both JAK2 kinase (IC 50 = 22 nM) and its JAK2 V617F mutant (IC 50 = 19 nM) without significant activity against 40 other representative kinases across the human kinome. SB1518 selectively inhibits the proliferation of cell lines driven by JAK2 or its mutants ( e.g. IC 50 = 81 nM for a murine BaF3 cell line stably transfected to express erythropoietin receptor and GFP-labeled JAK2 V617F ). It reduces basal phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT5 in BaF3-JAK2 V617F cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The excellent physicochemical, metabolic and pharmacokinetic properties of SB1518 render it amenable to oral dosing. SB1518 was investigated in a model of advanced MPD established by intravenous injection of BaF3-JAK2 V617F cells in nude mice. In several studies using different initial tumor burden and/or drug regimen, we observed dose-dependent and statistically significant therapeutic effects including normalization of elevated white blood cell count and reduction of GFP-labeled BaF3 cells in the peripheral blood, resolution of hepatosplenomegaly, reduction of phospho-STAT5 in diseased organs, prolonged survival and alleviation of terminal-stage anemia and thrombocytopenia. These therapeutic effects were observed at doses well tolerated by the animals. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of SB1518 for the treatment of myeloproliferative disorders caused by aberrant JAK2 signaling."
