    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic disease due to an underlying monoclonal plasma cell (PC) dyscrasia. Despite of dynamic symptoms associated with highly elevated VEGF, monoclonal PCs are thought to be quite small, and pathogenic significance of these PCs remains undetermined. In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES), target sequencing, and RNA sequencing of PCs in patients with POEMS syndrome in order to define its genetic profiles. Methods: Patients diagnosed with POEMS syndrome at Chiba University Hospital from July 2014 to June 2016 were enrolled. DNA was extracted from either PCs which were isolated from patients' bone marrow (BM) using CD138 MACS (Miltenyi) or buccal cells as controls. WES and target sequencing were performed using HiSeq2500 (Illumina) and MiSeq (Illumina), respectively. The data of WES and target sequencing were analyzed by Empirical Bayesian mutation Calling (EBCall). Copy number was analyzed using the data of WES. RNA sequencing of PCs isolated by MACS and FACS sorting was conducted using HiSeq 1500 (Illumina). PCs from some patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) were also collected as controls for RNA sequencing. Results: Twenty POEMS patients (M:F 12:8, mean age 42.6, range 16-78; 15 newly diagnosed, 5 refractory or relapsed cases) were included in this study. Regarding the types of M protein, 55% (11/20) were IgA-\u03bb, 25% (5/20) were IgG-\u03bb, and each individual case of the following; IgA-\u03bb+IgG-\u03bb, BJP-\u03bb, IgG-\u03ba, and Castleman's variant with no M protein. The mean serum VEGF was 6,471 pg/ml (range 1,190-13,800), and the mean PCs percentage in the BM was 4.4% (range 0.8-10.5). WES was performed in 15 cases; a total of 359 somatic mutations in 334 genes were revealed in 93.3% of cases (14/15) with a mean number of 23.9 (range 0-119) in each. All these mutated genes were significantly enriched in several pathways related to cell adhesion. Importantly, frequently mutated genes in MM such as NRAS , KRAS , and TP53 were not identified. Among all mutations, 1.7% were frameshift insertions, 2.0% were frameshift deletions, 4.2% were stop gains, 0.8% were non-frameshift deletions, 60.2% were other non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs), 29.5% were synonymous SNVs, and 1.7% were splicing mutations which were within 2-bp of a splicing junction. Copy-number variations were detected in 33.3% of cases (5/10) including -13 (2 cases), +1q (2 cases), and hyperdiploidy (2 cases). To carry out target sequencing in all 20 cases, we defined 51 target genes which included recurrently mutated genes from our WES data, frequently mutated genes in hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues according to the database (COSMIC), and 15 frequently mutated genes in MM ( NRAS , KRAS , TP53 , BRAF , CDKN2C , FGFR3 , BIRC3 , DIS3 , CYLD , KDM6A , LRP1B , FAM46C , COL6A3 , DNAH5 , and KRT6A ). A total of 60 somatic mutations were revealed in 65% of cases (13/20), and 9 new somatic mutations were found in the cases in which WES was also performed. Ten recurrently mutated genes were identified; KLHL6 in 20% of cases (4/20), each of LTB, RYR1 in 15% of cases (3/20), and each of EHD1 , EML4 , HEPHL1 , HIPK1 , PCDH10 , USH2A , and ZNF645 in 10% of cases (2/20). Among frequently mutated genes in MM, only 3 genes ( FAM46C , LRP1B , and DNAH5 ) were mutated, each in a single case. We finally conducted RNA sequencing of the FACS-sorted PCs in 5 POEMS patients compared to 5 MGUS and 4 MM patients. Upregulated genes were significantly enriched in some gene sets, gene ontology terms, and pathways related to immune response and cell adhesion, whereas downregulated genes were related to tumorigenesis. Of note, VEGF was not significantly upregulated in POEMS patients. Principal component analysis distinguished the 3 disease groups of patients with marginal overlaps between POEMS and MGUS, and also MGUS and MM. Conclusions: Our data clearly demonstrate that the genetic profiles of PCs in POEMS syndrome are distinct from those in MM and MGUS. Notably, PCs may not be the main source of extremely elevated VEGF in POMES syndrome. On-going further investigation will help clarify the molecular pathogenesis of POEMS syndrome.
