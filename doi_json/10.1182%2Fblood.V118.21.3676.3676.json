    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3676 Background: Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease based on biological analyses of tumor cells, with for instance the determination of two molecular subgroups, one with a profile close to germinal center B-cells and the second to activated B-cells. Data from the biology of tumor microenvironment could also be helpful to define different prognostic subgroups of DLBCL. The role of the biology of the patient with DLBCL, i.e. the host-related factors is little explored. Epidemiological studies showed that some inherited genetic variation in immune genes could increase the risk of lymphoma development and some retrospective studies indicated that patient's outcome could be predicted by some germ line polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes. The aim of this study is to determine the prognostic impact of 13 SNPs in 7 immune genes, IL10 (4 SNPs), Tumor Necrosis factor \u03b1 ( TNFA ), lymphotoxin \u03b1 ( LTA ), BAFF (3 SNPs), IL1A , IL8RB , IL4R (2 SNPs) in a cohort of newly diagnosed DLBCL patients included in the GELA LNH2003 prospective trials all treated by rituximab combined with chemotherapy. Patients and Methods: 1564 patients from France, Switzerland and Belgium were included in the 5 prospective multicentric trials of the LNH2003 program of the GELA designed for DLBCL patients who were stratified in different subgroups based on age and International Prognostic Index (IPI) score. A sample of peripheral blood lymphocytes was collected before treatment from 760 patients who signed a specific consent form for this genetic study. After pathologic review and exclusion of patients not receiving rituximab (48 patients), 554 DLBCL patients were available for this study. SNPs were genotyped using a TaqMan\u00ae based assay. Results: The median age of the 554 patients was 61 years (range, 18\u201393 years), 57% of them were male and 50% of patients presented at diagnosis a 2\u20133 age-adjusted IPI score. Chemotherapy regimen consisted in a combination of rituximab with CHOP-21 (110 patients, 20%), CHOP-14 (181 patients, 33%), low dose CHOP for patients older than 80 years (60 patients, 11%), or ACVBP regimen (203 patients, 36%). At the end of treatment, complete response (CR) or unconfirmed CR was observed in 75% of patients. After a median follow-up of 38 months, the 3-year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 70.2% and 75.7%, respectively. All the polymorphism distributions of the SNPs analyzed were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The main initial clinical characteristics of patients were not different according to the 13 studied SNPs, except for IL4R (rs2107356), CC carriers presented less frequently B symptoms than CT and TT carriers (28% vs. 41% and 61%, P = .01). No correlation was observed between the quality of the response at the end of the treatment and each genotype of the 13 studied SNPs. The 3-year PFS and OS were overall not influenced by the genotyping of the 13 SNPs. However, a trend for a better 3-year PFS for LTA +252GG carriers compared to LTA +252AG and AA carriers was observed (79.7% vs. 64.6% and 72.7%, P = .04). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the largest prospective multicentric study that investigates the role of immune SNPs on treatment response and outcome in a large cohort of newly diagnosed patients with DLBCL receiving rituximab. No correlation between SNPs and treatment response was observed. Analyses of the impact on outcome of each individual SNP showed only a trend for a prognostic role on PFS of LTA A252G SNP, which is already described as a functional SNP. The results will be further precise by the correlation of IL10 , BAFF and TNFA / LTA full haplotypes with response and outcome. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
