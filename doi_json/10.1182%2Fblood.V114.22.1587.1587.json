    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1587 Poster Board I-613 In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) WNT signaling is constitutively active and several members of this signaling pathway are uniformely upregulated in these cells. Apart from classical WNT receptors like FZD and LRP6, receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) has been shown to function as a receptor for WNT proteins, too. Furthermore, it could recently be demonstrated that ROR1 is frequently expressed on the surface of CLL cells and might therefore serve as a therapeutic target in this disease. However, so far only little is known about the expression status of this protein in different patients. Moreover, a diagnostic antibody for flow cytometric investigations is lacking. Thus, the aim of our study was to i) establish a directly labelled anti-ROR1 antibody for flow cytometry, ii) to confirm previous results on ROR1 expression in CLL, iii) to investigate ROR1 expression in different cell compartments and iv) correlate our findings to known markers of risk and disease progression. Peripheral blood of CLL patients as well as healthy volunteers was subjected to flow cytometric analysis. Besides standard determination of leukocyte subpopulations ZAP70 and CD38 status was assessed according to current diagnostic recommendations. In addition, ROR1 surface expression was first detected by flow cytometry using a specific primary antibody directed against ROR1 and a fluorescent labelled secondary antibody. Using this experimental setting we found that ROR1 is expressed on 63.4% of all neoplastic CLL cells and also on 30.5% of T cells in the peripheral CLL blood. In contrast, no ROR1 expression could be detected on NK cells, B cells, CD8 + - or CD4 + -T cells of healthy individuals. To improve the analytical technique the ROR1 antibody was directly conjugated with Phycoerythrin (PE) and the experiments were repeated. With the conjugated antibody we detected ROR1 expression on 97.1% of neoplastic CLL cells and virtually on no T lymphocytes. ROR1 expression levels correlated neither with the expression of ZAP70 nor with CD38. Again, we could not detect ROR1 expression on peripheral blood cells of our healthy volunteers. Taken together, ROR1 expression appears to be highly restricted to CLL cells. If in addition to CD5 and CD19 ROR1 detection is included into diagnostic flow cytometric panels the specificity and sensitivity of immunophenotypic CLL diagnostics may be greatly enhanced.
