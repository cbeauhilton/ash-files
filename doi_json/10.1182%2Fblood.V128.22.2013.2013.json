    "abstract_text": "Introduction: CLL is the most prevalent leukemia in the United States (\u2265120,000 cases) with approximately 5000 deaths per year. The dominant cause of mortality in CLL patients is serious infection. Indeed, about 80% of CLL patients will sustain infectious complications at some point during their disease course and infection risk increases with length of the disease. Steady-state hematopoiesis in BM is required to sustain a peripheral repertoire of blood cells and maintain immune competence. There have been few studies evaluating the hematopoietic capacity of CLL BM and how it may relate to immune competence. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine the status of BM hematopoiesis in untreated and treated CLL patients. Methods and findings: The hematopoietic stem (HSC) and progenitor cell pool (HSPC) in human BM is defined by expression of CD34 and lack of surface markers (Lin - ) expressed on their mature progeny. Frequencies of Lin - CD34 + progenitors in BM between age matched healthy subjects (HS) (n=22) and untreated CLL patients (n=10) were compared. We note that the Lin + cocktail used included an antibody to CD19, eliminating dilution of CD34 + HSPC frequency due to variation in leukemic B cell infiltration. CD34 + HSPCs were significantly reduced in untreated CLL patients (6.33\u00b13.01% vs. 2.04\u00b12.33% in HS vs. CLL, p=0.0004). Next we evaluated total CFU responding cells within the residual CD34 + cells to determine if they were functionally compromised. Numbers of total CFU-responsive CD34 + progenitors (CFU-GM, CFU-E, and CFU-GEMM) were reduced when assayed from purified CLL patient CD34 + cells compared to HS. Thus, while HSPC are present in CLL patient BM, they are functionally compromised even after removal from the tumor microenvironment. To determine if reductions in CFUs were accompanied by decreased myeloid and erythroid lineage differentiated progeny, we evaluated frequencies and absolute numbers of CD14 + monocytes and CD71 + erythroid progenitors by flow cytometry and found both were severely reduced in CLL patient BM. To determine if the reductions in myeloid/erythroid lineage cells was due to deficiencies in their precursor HSPCs, we evaluated frequencies and absolute numbers of HSC, multipotent progenitors (MPP), and common myeloid progenitors (CMP). Proportions, but not absolute numbers, of HSC, MPP, and CMP were significantly reduced in CLL patient BM. Frequencies of CD14 + monocytes and CD71 + erythroid precursors were also significantly reduced in patients with low BM tumor burden (designated as 20-40% BM involvement), suggesting that the hematopoietic dysfunction is not solely due to tumor burden. Comparative analysis of frequencies of CD14 + monocytes in BM to frequencies of monocytes in peripheral blood revealed a strong association, suggesting that for some immune cell types the blood immune repertoire may be reflective of BM dysfunction. In addition to BM evaluation of untreated CLL patients, we also studied a cohort of post-therapy patients (n=23). Not surprisingly, we found considerable heterogeneity in the extent of BM hematopoietic reconstitution. Nevertheless, we observed robust BM hematopoiesis post therapy in a subset of treated patients (n=9 of 23). Summary: Our findings reveal BM hematopoietic dysfunction (HD) in CLL not solely due to the degree of tumor burden. Importantly, the BM HD is reversible by effective therapies. The HD is manifested by reduced numbers and function of HSPCs and production of their mature progeny. Of significance is the severe reduction in monocytic and granulocytic cells found in CLL BM. This is an important finding as these two innate cell types provide critical first responder protection against invading pathogens. Our study also uncovered that levels of blood monocytes can mirror their diminished production in BM. Future studies will focus on determining the mechanism(s) that reduce the ability of CLL BM to sustain immune cell production in addition to determining if restoration of hematopoiesis is a necessary outcome for more effective therapies.
