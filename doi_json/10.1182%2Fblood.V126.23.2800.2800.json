    "abstract_text": "Background : NS-018 is an oral, selective, small molecule inhibitor of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). OBJECTIVE : The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of orally administered NS-018 in patients with PMF, post-PV MF, or post-ET MF. METHODS : This multicenter, Phase 1/2, 3+3 dose-escalation study of NS-018 enrolled patients with IPSS intermediate-1, intermediate-2, or high risk PMF, post-PV MF, or post-ET MF. The study drug, NS-018, was given orally either daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) in 28-day cycles. In Phase 1, changes in spleen size were assessed by manual palpation, quality of life with the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MF-SAF), and responses were assessed according to the IWG-MRT/ELN consensus criteria. Bone marrow fibrosis (BMF) was evaluated by biopsy, according to WHO criteria. Changes in grade of BM fibrosis from baseline were categorized as improvement, stabilization, or worsening. The Phase 1 portion of the study has been completed and data are presented here. RESULTS : In this Phase 1 study, 48 patients were enrolled across 10 dosing cohorts (75-400 mg QD/100-400 mg BID). Characteristics: 37 PMF, 5 post-PV MF, 6 post-ET MF with a median age (range) 69.5 yrs (38-83); M/F:29/19; 35 JAK2V617F+, and 23 previously treated with a different JAK2 inhibitor. At 400 mg QD/BID, NS-018 dosing was associated with drug-related neurologic adverse events (AEs) including dizziness, peripheral neuropathy, headache, disturbance in attention, vertigo, dysesthesia, paresthesia, aphasia, and nervous system disorder (not otherwise specified). The 300 mg QD dose was better tolerated than 250 mg BID or 300 mg BID, with fewer neurologic AEs, and was selected as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). For the 48 phase 1 patients, reductions in MF-SAF score were observed for all symptoms after 3 cycles, including for patients with prior JAK2 inhibitor treatment. In all dose cohorts, \u2265 50% patients achieved \u2265 50% score reduction from baseline in night sweats, pruritus and bone pain after 1 cycle. Moreover, \u2265 50% patients achieved \u2265 50% score reduction from baseline in abdominal pain and inactivity after 3 cycles. In patients who had received prior JAK2 inhibitor, \u2265 50% patients achieved \u2265 50% score reduction from baseline in filling up quickly, inactivity, night sweats and quality of life after 3 cycles. Among 36 patients with baseline splenomegaly \u2265 5 cm and treatment for \u2265 1 cycle, 20 (56%) showed \u2265 50% reduction in spleen size (confirmed for \u2265 8 weeks in 16 patients), including 9/19 (47%) patients with prior JAK2 treatment. According to IWG criteria, 14/36 (39%) patients showed splenic clinical improvement (CI) for \u2265 8 weeks, 4 had hemoglobin CI, and 1 had platelet CI. After 3 cycles of NS-018 treatment, 11/31 (37%) evaluable patients had a reduction in bone marrow fibrosis(BMF) by \u2265 1 grade. At any time during NS-018 treatment, 17/31 (55%) evaluable patients had a reduction in BMF by \u2265 1 grade. Overall, 23% (7/31) patients maintained improvement in BMF for \u2265 12 weeks. Reduction in BMF after 3 cycles was correlated with reduction in splenomegaly and hemoglobin responses. To date, 8 patients with prior JAK inhibitor treatment have been enrolled into the phase 2 portion of the trial. Updated Phase 2 data will presented at the meeting. CONCLUSIONS : The RP2D dose of NS-018 was 300 mg QD. This dose provided an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, and reduction in symptomatic splenomegaly. Phase 2 is ongoing and includes patients previously treated with other JAK2 inhibitors.
