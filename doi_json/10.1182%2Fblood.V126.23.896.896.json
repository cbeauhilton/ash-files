    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exist as a rare population with two essential properties of self-renewal and differentiation. HSCs can give rise to all hematopoietic progenitor and mature cells. While critical for a full understanding of the hematopoietic process and HSC-related clinical applications, the mechanisms of self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs remain elusive. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway plays essential roles in the regulation of hematopoiesis. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) activates multiple AGC kinases including Akt and is a pivotal regulator in this pathway. PDK1 phosphorylates Akt at its T308 residue and regulates the functional development of B and T cells during hematopoiesis. However, the role of PDK1 in HSCs has not been fully defined. In this study, we generated PDK1 conditional knockout mice Vav-Cre;PDK1 fl/fl (PDK1 \u0394/\u0394 ) to explore the roles of PDK1 in HSCs. While PDK1 \u0394/\u0394 mice have reduced B and T cell counts as previously described, their LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs were significantly increased in comparison with WT mice while MPPs and CMPs were decreased after PDK1 deletion, indicating that the loss of PDK1 perturbed the steady-state hematopoiesis. Furthermore, although deletion of PDK1 increased the frequency of HSCs, PDK1-deficient HSCs fail to reconstitute the hematopoietic system when PDK1-deficient HSCs were used in bone marrow transplantation and competitive transplantation experiments in comparison to the WT HSCs, indicating that PDK1 is vital for hematopoiesis. To explore the mechanisms by which PDK1 regulates HSC function, we examined the cell cycle status and found the percentage of PDK1 \u0394/\u0394 HSCs was decreased significantly in G0 stage while increased in G1 and S/G2/M phases. This suggests an increase in HSC exit from a quiescent state. Since MPPs were significantly decreased in bone marrow, we examined the percentage of Annexin V + DAPI - PDK1 \u0394/\u0394 and WT MPPs and found that they are comparable. This indicates that apoptosis did not cause the decrease in MPPs. In addition, a total of 300 LT-HSCs from PDK1 \u0394/\u0394 or WT mice and competitor cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice to examine whether the decrease in MPPs is due to a defect in HSC differentiation. We found that less than 1% of MPPs arose from PDK1 \u0394/\u0394 HSCs 12 weeks after transplantation, indicating that PDK1 is required for the differentiation from LT-HSCs to MPPs. Because the full activation of Akt requires cooperative phosphorylation at its S473 and T308 residues by mTORC2 and PDK1, respectively, we also investigated the function of HSCs in Rictor \u0394/\u0394 PDK1 \u0394/\u0394 (DKO) mice in conjunction with Rictor \u0394/\u0394 or PDK1 \u0394/\u0394 mice to explore how mTORC2 and/or PDK1 influence Akt function in HSCs. The flow cytometric analyses of peripheral blood and bone marrow samples revealed very similar parameters of Rictor \u0394/\u0394 PDK1 \u0394/\u0394 and PDK1 \u0394/\u0394 mice. Interestingly, Rictor seemed to exert a minimal impact on HSCs and MPPs. More importantly, in contrast to Rictor \u0394/\u0394 , Rictor \u0394/\u0394 PDK1 \u0394/\u0394 HSCs failed to reconstitute the hematopoietic system after transplantation as PDK1 \u0394/\u0394 HSCs, suggesting that PDK1 plays a dominant role in the Akt-mediated regulation of HSC function. To explore the mechanism that leads to the defect in HSCs due to loss of PDK1, we assessed ROS levels in PDK1 -deficient HSCs and found that PDK1 -deficient LSKs and HSCs exhibit greatly reduced ROS levels when compared with the control HSCs. Treating PDK1 -deficient BM cells with BSO in vitro increased cellular ROS levels and the colony counts of PDK1 -deficient BM cells significantly. Notably, the recovery effect was only observed with BSO concentrations lower than 0.03 mM. This suggests that ROS levels are precisely controlled in HSCs. Higher or lower ROS levels beyond the normal range are both harmful to normal HSC functions. Since increased SDF\u03b1 expression is associated with cellular ROS levels in various cells including hematopoietic cells, we also treated PDK1 \u0394/\u0394 mice with SDF\u03b1 and found that it couldpartially rescue the defective differentiation ability of PDK1-deficient HSCs. In addition, we found that PDK1 deletion could significantly prolong the life span and inhibit the leukemia development in murine T-ALL model via altering leukemic cell differentiation and proliferation. Taken together, PDK1 controls HSC differentiation via regulating cellular ROS levels and regulates malignant hematopoiesis. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
