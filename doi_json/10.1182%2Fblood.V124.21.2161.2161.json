AbbVie and Genentech provided financial support for these studies and participated in the review and approval of this publication. The BCL-2-selective inhibitor ABT-199 has demonstrated efficacy in numerous preclinical models of hematologic malignancies without causing thrombocytopenia, a dose-limiting toxicity associated with the BCL-2/BCL-X L inhibitor navitoclax (Souers et al. 2013. Nat. Med. 19, 202-208). ABT-199 has also demonstrated clinical activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) (Seymour et al. 2014. J. Clin. Oncol. 32, 448s; Davids et al. 2014. J. Clin. Oncol. 32, 544s). Despite these encouraging early clinical data, some subjects do not respond to ABT-199 or progress while on treatment. Pre-clinical models indicate that both intrinsic and acquired resistance may be a consequence of MCL-1 expression. Consequently, we have explored potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of CDK9, a kinase known to maintain the expression of MCL-1 through its role in p-TEFb-mediated transcription. Inhibition of CDK9 resulted in the rapid loss in RNA polymerase II phosphorylation (Serine 5) and MCL-1 expression that was closely followed by the induction of apoptosis in MCL-1-dependent cell lines, a cellular response that could be rescued by overexpression of BCL-2. Substantial synergy was observed between CDK9 inhibitors and ABT-199 in a number of hematologic cell lines with intrinsic or acquired resistance to ABT-199. Direct inhibition of MCL-1 with the small molecule BH3 mimetic A-1210477 was also highly synergistic with ABT-199, further validating the utility of co-inhibiting MCL-1 and BCL-2 function simultaneously in ABT-199 resistant tumors. Importantly, the CDK9 inhibitor-ABT-199 combination was well tolerated in vivo and demonstrated efficacy superior to either agent alone in xenograft models of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). These data indicate that CDK9 inhibitors may be highly efficacious when used in combination with ABT-199 for the treatment of hematologic malignancies.
