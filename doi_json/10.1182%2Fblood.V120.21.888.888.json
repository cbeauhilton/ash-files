    "abstract_text": "Abstract 888 Introduction: Pediatric acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) occurred in 6.6% (84/1271) of the children enrolled to the AML-BFM98 and 2004 studies. Despite a similar phenotype in morphology and immunophenotype, AMKL shows a heterogenous cytogenetic distribution (normal karyotype 23%, complex karyotype 21%, t(1;22) 9%; MLL-rearrangement 8%; monosomy 7 5%, trisomy 8 5%; other aberrations 29%). Mutations of the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA1 have been identified in almost all children suffering myeloid leukemia of Down syndrome (ML-DS). In addition, GATA1 mutations (GATA1mut) could be identified in children with trisomy 21 mosaic. Here, AMKL without evidence of Down syndrome or Down syndrome mosaic were analyzed for mutations in exon 1, 2 or 3 of the transcription factor GATA1. Patients: Seventy-one children from the AML-BFM Study group (n=51; 2000\u20132011), the Netherlands (n=10), France (n=3) and Scandinavia (n=7) were included. Within the AML-BFM Group the 51 analyzed patients showed similar characteristics compared to the total cohort of 84 children with AMKL of the AML-BFM 98 and 2004 studies. AMKL was confirmed according to the WHO classification by genetics (t(1;22)); morphology and immunophenotyping. Table 1 a) summarizes the patientxs characteristics and b) the cytogenetic results. Methods: For GATA1 mutation screening genomic DNA was amplified by PCR reaction for exon 1, 2, and 3. PCR amplicons were analyzed by direct sequencing or following denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (WAVE). Results: Seven different GATA1 mutations were detected in 8 children (11.1%; table 2 ). In all GATA1mut leukemia, a trisomy 21 within the leukemic blasts could be detected. Seven out of these 8 children and all other 64 AMKL patients have been treated with intensive chemotherapy regimens according the study group protocols. The results are given in table 2 . All achieved continuous complete remission (CCR; 0.4 to 4.2 years). View large View Large In one newborn with typical morphology and immunophenotype a GATA1mut associated transient leukemia was supposed. The child achieved CCR (follow-up 6 years). In total, allogeneic stem cell transplantation in 1 st CR was performed in 6 children with AMKL (GATA1mut leukemia n=1). View large View Large Conclusions: GATA1 mutations occurred in 11% of children with AMKL without any symptoms or evidence of trisomy 21 or trisomy 21 mosaic. GATA1 mutations are associated with a trisomy 21 within the leukemic blasts. Although non-response occurred, prognosis was significant better compared to other AMKL. Therefore, analysis of GATA1 mutation in infant AMKL is strongly recommended. Whether treatment reduction similar to ML-DS Down syndrome is feasible needs to be confirmed.
