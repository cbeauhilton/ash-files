    "abstract_text": "Background Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL) is a rare form of lymphoma, comprising less than 1% of the cases. However, HSTL extracts a highly disproportionate toll on patients with a median age of diagnosis of 35 years and an expected median survival of less than two years. The vast majority of HSTL patients eventually succumb to their disease. The genetic basis of the disease is largely unknown. Although abnormalities of chromosome 7, including isochromosome 7q occur commonly in the disease, the role of specific genes and genetic mutations to the disease remains essentially unknown. Methods In this study, we sought to define the genetic features of HSTL through the whole genome sequencing and exome sequencing of 32 HSTL tumors and germline DNA (where available) from the same patients. Exome enrichment of DNA was carried out using the Agilent solution-based system of exon capture, which uses RNA baits to target all protein coding genes as well as \u223c700 human microRNAs. Both whole genome and exome sequencing were performed using the Illumina platform. Results We identified 28 candidate cancer genes that were recurrently mutated in HSTL. Commonly implicated biological processes comprising these genes included signal transduction (e.g. PIK3CD, KRAS) and chromatin modification (e.g. TET1, SETD2 and MLL3), accounting for 16% and 23% of the total genetic events, respectively. Nearly all of these genes have been implicated in HSTL for the first time and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of the disease and potential targets for therapy. Whole genome sequencing confirmed isochromosome 7q as the most common recurrent chromosomal abnormality in HSTL and additional structural genetic alterations in chromosome 7. Conclusion Our study provides the most comprehensive genetic portrait of HSTL to date, and is a significant step in defining the genetic causes of this disease.
