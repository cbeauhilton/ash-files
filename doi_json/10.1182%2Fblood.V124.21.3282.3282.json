    "abstract_text": "Introduction We have previously developed a primary human bone marrow model in CLL which allows us to study marrow derived mesenchymal stroma cells (MSC) and mimic in vivo MSC-leukemic interactions in CLL (Ding, Blood, 2010) These interactions proved to be bidirectional with functional implications for both cell types. However the biologic and clinical implications of these bilateral cellular interactions in relation to MSC function in CLL patients have not been completely studied. MSC are clearly established as an essential component in forming supportive marrow niches for hematopoiesis. Our focus in this study thus was to further investigate on the status of CLL MSC function in comparison with normal MSC and the impact of the leukemic CLL B cell on MSC function and its role in forming marrow niches in CLL. Methods Bone marrow (BM) aspirates of CLL patients or normal age-matched subjects were used to generate MSC and these MSC were then assessed for various functions. Specifically we assessed the growth, differentiation capacity, gene expression, cytokine secretion profile and transcriptome analysis of CLL and normal MSC using colony forming unit (CFU) assay, MSC differentiation assay, Affymetrix U133 2.0 plus array and RNA sequencing respectively. To determine MSC CFU frequency, fixed number of nucleated cells (5 or 10 million) from BM aspirates were added in MSC growth medium for 10 days to form CFU. CFU frequency was then calculated by dividing the number of MSC colonies by the fixed number of inputted nucleated cells. In order to test the specific gene changes that occurred in MSC after their interaction with CLL leukemic cells, normal MSC were co-cultured with CLL cells for 1 week and subsequently followed by cell growth, gene expression analysis with RNA sequencing and cytokine profiles using a multiplex assay. Results CLL MSC generated significantly lower CFU colonies compared to normal subjects (CLL [n=24] vs normal [n=6] mean: 2.2 vs. 22 CFU per million nucleated cells, p=0.01). In order to test if the lower number of CLL MSC CFU was due to their reduced growth capacity or lower frequency, we then performed the CFU assay using identical numbers of CLL and normal MSC at the start of culture. CLL MSC was found to have significantly lower CFU capacity compared to normal MSC (mean: 2.1 [CLL] vs 4.5 [normal] CFU/10 input cell, n=7 in each group, p=0.03). To investigate the mechanism(s) for the reduced growth capacity of CLL MSC, we compared the gene expression profiles of non-stimulated CLL vs. normal MSC (n=10 for each group) with the following outcomes: CLL MSC had increased expression of cell cycle inhibitor: p16(Ink4a) and p57, both key markers of cell senescence (Baker, Nature, 2011); CLL MSC overexpressed homeobox B cluster of transcription factors, key regulator for cell development and differentiation. Wnt inhibitors DKK1/DKK2 and non-canonical Wnt 5b known to be associated with aging were found to be 10 and 2 fold more elevated in CLL MSC. In addition, MSC abundantly produced a milieu of the cytokines MCP-1/IL-8/IL-6/IL-1Ra after interaction with CLL leukemic cells. These cytokines are associated with a senescent associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Co-culture experiments of normal MSC with CLL Leukemic cells revealed significant impact of leukemic cells on normal MSC functions. Co-culture with a low density of CLL leukemic cells (CLL to MSC ratio: \u226410,000/1) increased MSC growth (1.2 fold). However, high density co-culture of CLL cells with MSC (CLL to MSC ratio of 100,000/1) inhibited MSC growth (0.8 fold). Transcriptome analysis of normal MSC before and after one week of co-culture with CLL leukemic cells showed that normal MSC had alteration of ~1500 genes. Many of the modified genes (CDKN2B, DKK2, LIF, HGF, FOXQ1 etc) are known to be involved in regulation of cell growth and senescence. Conclusion Collectively, these results demonstrated that bone marrow derived CLL MSC have decreased proliferative potential and possess senescent phenotypes. Importantly these senescent features were inducible in normal MSC after their interaction with CLL leukemic cells implying that leukemic B cells can educate MSC to become senescent. The implications of the CLL MSC senescence status are multiple and include: defective hematopoietic niches due to dysfunctional MSC, immune dysregulation and the enhanced nurturing of CLL B cell by these MSC. We are now investigating several of these latter features in our current work.
