    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Idelalisib (IDELA) is a selective PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor approved for use with rituximab in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Reversible transaminase elevation (TAE) has been observed in all CLL clinical trials involving IDELA, with frequencies of Gr \u22653 elevation in company sponsored Ph 2 and 3 studies utilizing the approved dose of 150 mg orally twice a day, ranging broadly from approximately 10% (Sharman ASH 2014) to 41% (Hillmen EHA 2017). TAE leads to permanent discontinuation of IDELA in approximately 3% of patients (Coutre EHA 2015). Risk factors for Gr \u22653 TAE are not well understood. Lampson et al. ( Blood 2016) reported a trend toward increased risk in younger patients and those with mutated IGHV in a series of 24 previously untreated CLL patients who received IDELA monotherapy. In the present study, we analyze the rates of Gr \u22653 TAE across all fully enrolled, Gilead sponsored Ph 2 and 3 studies with the goal of identifying risk factors related to patient and treatment characteristics and selected CLL genetic alterations. Methods: Data were reviewed from patients who received at least 1 dose of IDELA in any of 6 Ph 2 or 3 studies, 3 for treatment na\u00efve (TN) and 3 for relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL. The following variables were used for analysis: age, prior therapy (Y vs N), combination with bendamustine plus rituximab (BR; Y vs N), del(17p) (Y vs N), and IGHV mutated vs unmutated. Results: A total of 853 patients were enrolled and treated with IDELA (Table 1) and comprise the safety analysis set (SAS). The median age was 67 y (range: 37-90), and the median IDELA exposure time was 11 mo (range: <1-43). Of those patients experiencing Gr \u22653 TAE, the median time to onset was 8 weeks. TN patients were at greater risk than R/R (Figure 1; HR=2; log rank p<0.0001). The other risk factors were then evaluated separately in the TN and R/R groups, as well as in the entire SAS. Significantly increased risk was found in younger patients enrolled in R/R trials (Figure 2; log rank p=0.001) and also within the entire SAS (log rank p=0.013). For patients in R/R trials, treatment with BR was a significant risk factor (log rank p=0.0005); although patients receiving BR were younger, the increased risk was seen across the age ranges. In the TN population, del(17p) was a risk factor (log rank p=0.02), but this relationship is mainly driven by the 17p-specific Study 133 and thus may be confounded by a study-related effect. All other analyses yielded p-values greater than 0.05. The incidence of Gr \u22653 TAE in the placebo groups of the R/R studies was 2.2% overall, 3.8% for BR, and 1.1% for non-BR-containing regimens. Conclusions: In this ad hoc analysis of 853 patients treated in Gilead sponsored trials of IDELA, younger age and TN status were risk factors for developing Gr \u22653 elevation of hepatic transaminases, as was treatment with BR for patients with R/R CLL. The highest incidence of Gr \u22653 TAE was observed in a single-arm trial of previously untreated patients with del(17p). IGHV mutation status was not a significant risk factor in this dataset. A statistical model of risk factors for Gr \u22653 TAE will be presented, considering interactions between the factors.
