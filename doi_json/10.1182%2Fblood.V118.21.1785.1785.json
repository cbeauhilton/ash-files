    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1785 Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the progressive clonal expansion of CD5+ B cells. Approximately 8\u201310% of CLL patients have a first degree relative with CLL, indicating that genetic factors can contribute to disease susceptibility. Genome wide association (GWA) studies have identified 16 \u201ccommon variants,\u201d single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a population prevalence of >5%, that confer risk for CLL. Among patients with CLL, the clinical course can be highly heterogeneous. Studies have defined disease-characteristics that vary among patients that can be used as markers to help predict clinical outcome. African American (AA) CLL patients have a poorer overall survival than Caucasians. However, there is little information on whether there are distinctive, ethnic-associated disease-characteristics that contribute to differences in clinical outcome. Moreover, studies of the genetics of CLL have involved primarily Caucasian patients. For these reasons, we examined for ethnic-related differences in the distribution and prevalence of CLL-associated SNPs and adverse disease-associated characteristics among AA with CLL relative to those of Caucasian patients with this disease. Methods: The clinical and biologic characteristics of 43 AA CLL patients ascertained at Duke University and the Durham VA Medical Center were tabulated and compared to Caucasian CLL patients at the same centers. Fifteen SNPs were genotyped in this \u201cdiscovery\u201d cohort of 43 AA CLL patients using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. As a \u201cvalidation\u201d cohort, 70 AA CLL patients ascertained by the CLL Research Consortium (CRC) were assayed using the same platform. Three control groups were considered in analysis: (1) previously published Caucasian CLL patients, (2) control AA genotypes reported in the HapMap database and (3) control AA with no history of malignancy from other GWA studies. The 3' untranslated region of CPEB1 was sequenced in AA CLL patients using conventional Sanger sequencing. Results: Among the Duke/Durham VA CLL patients, no significant differences were observed in age, WBC count, platelet count, or hemoglobin at diagnosis; lymphocyte doubling time; Rai stage; ZAP70 expression; or CD38 expression between AA and Caucasian patients. AA had a larger proportion of trisomy 12 and fewer 13q.14 deletions than Caucasians: 40.0% of AA had trisomy 12 and 15.0% had del 13q, compared to 14.6% and 40.7% of Caucasians, respectively. IGHV mutation status also varied between races, with 62.2% of AA having unmutated IGHV , compared to 38.4% of Caucasians. Disparities in clinical outcomes were similar to that reported in the SEER database: overall survival was 8.8 years in AA patients and 17.8 years in Caucasians, and time to first treatment was 2.8 years among AAs and 4.5 years for Caucasians. Risk allele frequencies among 15 genotyped SNPs showed that 14 SNPs had risk allele frequencies that statistically differed between AA patients and Caucasian CLL patients. In 9 of 14 SNPs, the risk allele was less common in AA than in Caucasians but similar to that AA controls. In the other 5 SNPs, the risk allele was more common in AA CLL than Caucasian CLL, and similar to that of AA controls in 4 of the SNPs. A single SNP, rs783540 (CPEB1) was found to have an increased frequency in AA patients with CLL when compared to both Caucasian CLL and control AA. As an exploratory analysis to identify possible pathogenic variants, the 3' UTR of CPEB1 was sequenced as there are no common non-synonymous SNPs in CPEB1. Preliminary review of the sequencing data revealed that a G insertion SNP (rs34816185) that alters a predicted miRNA binding site is in linkage disequilibrium with rs783540 (D'= 0.978). Conclusions: Most SNPs associated with CLL risk are less frequent in AA than in Caucasian CLL patients. However, rs783540 ( intron 2 , CPEB1) risk allele was more frequent in AA CLL than that previously reported in Caucasian CLL or AA controls. Initial data suggests that rs783540 is linked to a SNP in the 3' UTR of CPEB1, which may have functional significance. Studies to better delineate the functional and clinical implications of these germline variants are underway. Our data provide the first evidence of differential genetic risk as a determinant of CLL biology among different ethnic groups. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
