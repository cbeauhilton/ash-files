    "abstract_text": "Background: Minimal residual disease (MRD) quantification prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a powerful predictor for post-transplant outcome. Thus, new strategies with modified transplantation procedures are needed to reverse the outcomes of that remain MRD-positive despite multiple induction attempts. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prognostic relevance of MRD status in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), especially those with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL (Ph+ ALL), receiving the conditioning regimen of FA5-Bucy, registered on http:// ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02328950). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our HSCT experience using FA5-Bucy, i.e., 5-day salvage chemotherapy (Fludarabine/Ara-C) and conditioning (Busulfan/ Cyclophosphamide) for patients with ALL. A total of 48 consecutive patients from 2013 to 2016 are analyzed. 11 out of 48 (7 males and 4 females) were diagnosed with Ph+ ALL with the induction treatments including a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Median age was 30 years (range, 8-52 years). Among whom four (36.4%) achieved complete remission(CR)at transplantation, Six (54.5%) with detectable residual P190 BCR-ABL positive leukaemic cells, while 1 (9.1%) not in the status of remission with 39.5% blasts in the bone marrow (BM). The other 37 cases were Ph-negative (Ph-) ALL, with the median age of 21 years (range, 2-61 years). Among whom 25 (67.6%) patients were in CR, 6 (16.2%) MRD-positive and 6 (16.2%) with 23.5%-98% BM blasts. The MRD status was monitored by four-color FCM in Ph- group, and by RT-PCR to detect the chimeric bcr-abl mRNA transcript in Ph+ group. Patients were transplanted either from an HLA-identical sibling or haplo-identical related donors. The GVHD prophylaxis consisted of ATG, CsA, MMF and short-term MTX. None of these patients had severe infection or organ failure before HSCT. RESULTS: All patients achieved successful engraftment and full donor chimerism. Patients with Ph+ ALL seems have a better outcome than that with Ph- ALL (3-year OS of 54.5% vs 37.8%, P=0.245). With a median follow-up of 666 (83-1276) days, the 1y-OS and 1y-DFS were 72.7%, 3y-OS and 3y-DFS were 54.5% in Ph+ group, respectively, and non-relapse mortality and relapse incidence were 18.2% and 10%. MRD monitoring is an important tool for relapse prediction in Ph- ALL patients (3-year OS and DFS of MRD-positive vs MRD-negative =16.7% vs 56%, P=0.021).However, the profile of OS and DFS was similar in Ph+ patients with bcr-abl positive to that with bcr-abl negative (3-year OS and DFS of bcr-abl positive vs bcr-abl negative= 57.1% vs 50%, P=0.744). Severe acute-GvHD (aGVHD) occurred in 3/11 patients. Few patients experienced mild-to-moderate toxicity, and main causes of death were aGVHD. CONCLUSION: We concluded that allo-HSCT with the sequential tumor-ablative conditioning of FA5-Bucy offers great benefits for the patients with Ph+ ALL, with the potentially capability of reducing or overcoming the negative impacts of MRD. Thus creates exciting transplant opportunities for patients not in remission to be cured.
