    "abstract_text": "Genetic correction of patient-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells is a powerful strategy for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies such as \u03b2 thalassemia and sickle cell disease. One genetic strategy for the correction of \u03b2 thalassemia is to replace mutant or deleted \u03b2-globin alleles with a wild-type gene by homologous recombination in ES cells. Thalassemic mice that mimic the disorder have been generated by targeted gene deletion of the adult murine \u03b2-globin genes (PNAS 92: 9259\u20139263). We derived ES cells from our \u03b2-globin knockout mice and produced genetically identical mutant mice by injecting the ES cells into tetraploid embryos. These cloned \u03b2 thalassemic mice have a severe microcytic anemia characterized by a marked reduction of the erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV), hemoglobin level (Hb), and hematocrit (Hct), and a marked increase in reticulocytes and red cell distribution width (RDW) compared to cloned wild-type control animals. In contrast to the normochromic, normocytic erythrocytes of wild-type clones, erythrocytes in peripheral blood smears of \u03b2 thalassemic mice were hypochromic and exhibit extreme anisopoikilocytosis. A targeting construct containing 8.7 kb of mouse homology flanking a human \u03b3- and \u03b2-globin gene cassette and a hygromycin marker gene was electroporated into the \u03b2 thalassemic ES cells. After selection, DNA from 48 ES cell colonies was analyzed by PCR to identify homologous recombinants. Nineteen colonies (40%) had correctly integrated the human globin genes into the deleted mouse \u03b2-globin locus. Correctly targeted cells were injected into tetraploid blastocysts to produce mice that are derived solely from the corrected ES cells. These cloned mice synthesize high levels of human \u03b2-globin polypeptide that corrects the \u03b1- to \u03b2-globin chain imbalance, thereby eliminating the thalassemic erythrocyte morphology. The MCV, Hb, Hct, RDW, and reticulocyte levels in the blood of these mice are normal. These results demonstrate that a severe hemoglobinopathy can be cured after targeted gene replacement of a mutant gene(s) with a wild-type allele by homologous recombination in ES cells.",
