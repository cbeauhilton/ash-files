    "abstract_text": "Background : Red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization can follow exposure to foreign RBC antigens during transfusion therapy and during pregnancy/delivery. Alloantibodies against RBC antigens can cause potentially fatal hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the newborn. Recent studies indicate that inflammatory states, including autoimmunity, promote RBC alloimmunization. For example, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have an elevated risk of RBC alloimmunization. Approximately 50% of SLE patients have a pro-inflammatory type 1 interferon (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2) gene signature, defined as the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), that is associated with disease severity. Recent studies in mouse transfusion models indicate that IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 significantly promotes RBC alloimmunization. Thus, we hypothesized that IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 produced in a lupus mouse model would promote RBC alloimmunization following transfusion. Methods : To test this hypothesis, we utilized the pristane-induced lupus mouse model, known to manifest lupus autoantibodies and a lupus-like phenotype. Mice lacking the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR1 -/- ), mice lacking transcription factors required for IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production (IRF3/7 -/- ) and wildtype (WT) mice were administered an intraperitoneal injection of pristane 14 days prior to transfusion with transgenic RBCs expressing the KEL antigen. At the time of transfusion, serum IFN\u03b1 levels were measured by ELISA, and expression of interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) was measured by quantitative PCR. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the anti-KEL IgM and IgG responses were measured by flow cytometry 5 days and 7-28 days, respectively, following transfusion. A Mann-Whitney U test and a Kruskall-Wallis test with a Dunn's post-test was used to compare 2 or more than 2 groups, respectively. Results : Pristane induced serum IFN\u03b1 in WT mice (Day 14 post-pristane, mean IFN\u03b1=127.3 Units/ml \u00b1 28.21 standard error of the mean, SEM, p<0.01), which was undetectable in untreated mice. Pristane treatment also resulted in a non-significant trend toward upregulated expression of ISG15, post-pristane ISG15 =2.94 \u00b1 1.16 SEM; no pristane ISG15 = 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 SEM). Following transfusion, untreated mice did not form anti-KEL IgG. However, pristane-treated WT mice produced significantly elevated levels of anti-KEL IgM and anti-KEL IgG in 3 out of 3 experiments (untreated IgM MFI = 79.1 \u00b1 13.5, pristane-treated IgM MFI = 142.7 \u00b1 21.6, p<0.01; untreated IgG MFI = 10.7\u00b1 4.6, pristane-treated IgG MFI= 203.9 \u00b1 99.6, p<0.05, Figure 1). Pristane-treated IFNAR1 -/- and IRF3/7 -/- mice produced significantly lower levels of anti-KEL IgG (IFNAR1 -/- MFI = 39.0 \u00b1 35.6, p<0.05; IRF3/7 -/- MFI = 36.1 \u00b1 16.3, p<0.02) compared to WT mice (MFI = 361 \u00b1 148). Conclusion : Pristane induction of a lupus-like phenotype promoted alloimmunization to the KEL RBC antigen in an IFN\u03b1/\u03b2-dependent manner. These results warrant further investigation of the role of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 in alloimmunization to other RBC antigens, and the investigation of the contribution of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 responses to increased frequency of alloimmunization in patients with SLE.
