    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Venous thrombosis is a well documented adverse effect in about one percent of patients treated with tamoxifen. Although the precise role of elevated factor VIII in defining venous thrombotic risk is not well understood, current data suggest that factor VIII is an independent risk factor for venous thrombosis. Methods: Case report. Results: In May 2011, a 76-year-old male underwent right modified radical mastectomy in May 2011. Tumor was a 2.5 cm well-differentiated, invasive ductal carcinoma, with lymphatic invasion present and widely negative surgical margins. The patient (pt) had one ipsilateral axillary lymph node (out of 26 sampled) with two microscopic foci ( 150 IU/dl) that has persisted during his follow-up. Conclusions: Our case supports the notion that high levels of factor VIII are a risk factor for venous thrombosis. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
