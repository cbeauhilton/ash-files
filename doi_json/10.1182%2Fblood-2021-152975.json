    "abstract_text": "Background Thrombus formation is a complex, dynamic and multistep process, based on two crucial steps: platelet adhesion and platelet aggregation that both involve the large multimeric plasma glycoprotein Von Willebrand Factor (VWF). VWF binding to the GPIb/X/V complex initiates platelet adhesion to the vessel wall at high shear stress and triggers platelet activation resulting in the generation of thrombin and activation of integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 on the platelet surface. This activation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in turn leads to outside-in signalling and promotes binding of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 to fibrinogen and VWF, mediating thrombus growth. Trigging receptor expressed on myeloid cells like transcript-1 (TLT-1) is a transmembrane receptor, which is targeted to \u03b1-granules of platelets and megakaryocytes. Thrombin-induced platelet activation rapidly presents TLT-1 on the platelet surface and releases a soluble form (sTLT-1) into the circulation. To date the only known ligand for TLT-1 is fibrinogen and TLT-1 has been implicated in the regulation of inflammation-associated thrombosis. Interestingly, a putative interaction of VWF with TLT-1 was indicated by a screen with known platelet receptors. Aim We aimed to evaluate the effect of TLT-1/VWF interaction on platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Methods Recombinant TLT-1 and VWF were purified and the interaction between TLT-1 and VWF was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance. Static interaction was confirmed by an ELISA based binding assay. Flow assays assessed TLT-1 dependent thrombus formation in vitro. The effects of TLT-1 knockout on thrombus formation in vivo were examined via intravital microscopy of the flow restricted inferior vena cava (IVC) and imaging of platelet attachment and fibrin formation over 6 hours. Furthermore, thrombus formation and resolution was followed by high resolution ultrasound imaging after stenosis induction for 28 days. Integrin aIIbb3 activation was analysed by flow cytometry using the JonA antibody in murine platelet rich plasma. Results VWF bound to soluble TLT-1 with high affinity in a calcium dependent manner (K D = 1.9 nM). The binding site on VWF was mapped to the A3D4 domains and high molecular weight VWF multimers had the greatest affinity for TLT-1. Moreover, HEK293 cells transfected with TLT-1 bound to VWF and VWF strings formed specifically on TLT-1 expressing cells, confirming the interaction between the two proteins. VWF inhibited the binding of fibrinogen to TLT-1, suggesting that VWF is a preferred binding partner of TLT-1. Human platelets exhibited increased TLT-1 surface expression after TRAP-6 induced platelet activation and TLT-1 was detected throughout thrombi formed under flow. Furthermore, a TLT-1 blocking antibody inhibited the interaction of TLT-1 with VWF and reduced platelet capture to type I collagen under shear stress. Ex vivo perfusion of blood from TLT-1 knock out mice over type I collagen also resulted in reduced thrombus formation compared to blood from wild-type mice. TLT-1 knock-out platelets were activated by thrombin similar to wild-type controls, based on P-selectin expression in platelet rich plasma. However, activation of integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 determined by JonA staining was reduced in the absence of TLT-1. This phenotype of reduced integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation on P-selectin positive platelets was phenocopied by the thrombin platelet response in platelet rich plasma from VWF -/- mice, but not GPIb\u03b1-deficient mice, indicating that the TLT-1-VWF interaction on platelets directly influences integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation. Significantly, thrombus formation was markedly reduced in TLT-1 knockout mice in the IVC model in vivo in comparison to wild-type mice. Conclusions This study demonstrates that TLT-1 is a novel platelet ligand for VWF, and that TLT-1 may preferentially bind VWF over fibrinogen. We propose a TLT-1/VWF dependent integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation mechanism which plays a pivotal role in thrombus formation under non-inflammatory and potentially inflammatory conditions.
