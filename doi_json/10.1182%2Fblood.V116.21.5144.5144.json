Methods Search the documents utilized by the CNKI, CBM, PubMED and Highwire Press database. According to the retrieved result, a summary about the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells characteristic and the feasibility of implanting bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of aplastic anemia was made. Results 1. The bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells(bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, BMSC)is another important ingredient in the bone marrow, besides hematopoietic stem cells. It is easy to separate, raise, multiply and purify mesenchymal stem cells. It still carrys the qualities of stem cells after many generations of rising. When raised in vitro, BMSC may secrete many kinds of cell factors and the growth factors,and has the long-term hematopoietic supporting function, which does not only participate in the production hemopoiesis micro environment support hemopoiesis directly, but also able to grow and differentiate into various hematopoiesis supporting bone marrow matrix cells in the suitable condition. 2. BMSC has the great potential in self-renewal and multi-direction differentiation. Not only can it take function as substitute cells in the tissue framework, it also present good application prospect with regard to hematopoietic reconstruction, transplant immunity, and genetic treatment. 3. BMSC can repair the damage of hematopoietic micro environment(HME), and promote the reconstruction of hematopoiesis and immunity after transplant. 4. The low immunogenic and antigen present ability of BMSC provide the molecular foundation for the wide application of BMSC in stem cells transplant. 5. The pathogenesis of aplastic anemia(aplastic anemia, AA)is very complicated. The current belief is that aplastic anemia is related to the intrinsic multiplication flaw of hematopietic stem cells, the inadequate function of the hematopoietic micro environment, and the disorder of organism immune function. Studies have proved that there's the remarkable decrease of ectogenous hematopoietic supporting function and immuno-suppression capability of BMSC in aplastic anemia. Nowadays, methods have been established in separating, raising, and multiplying BMSC outside the human body. Besides, studies have revealed that transplanting BMSC can restore the hematopoietic micro environment, and the BMSC plays an important part in modulating transplant immunity. 6. Observe the efficacy and safety of the treatment on 11 patients of aplastic anemia with BMSC and the outcome indicate that the treatment is effective and safe. Accordingly, there's a good prospect for applying BMSC transplant as the treatment for aplastic anemia. Conclusions It has a good effect and prospect to apply bone mesenchymal stem cells transplant to the treatment of aplastic anemia. It provides a new approach to the clinical treatment of aplastic anemia. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
