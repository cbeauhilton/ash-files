    "abstract_text": "Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an immunosuppressive lysosomotropic amine that has activity against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We previously reported low incidences of acute GVHD in unrelated donor transplant recipients who received prophylactic HCQ in addition to standard GVHD prophylaxis ( BBMT  2003 ; 9 : 714 \u2013721 ). We herein report results of a single-institution phase III trial, in which 95 recipients of matched sibling allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation were randomized to receive, in a double-blind fashion, and in addition to prophylactic cyclosporine A (CSA), HCQ or placebo starting 21 days pre-transplant and continued until d+365. HCQ was very well tolerated and not associated with side effects. The addition of HCQ had no effects on lymphocyte subsets both pre- and post-transplant. Overall, the incidence of acute GVHD was 59% in both arms, and severe acute GVHD occurred in 11% (HCQ) and 14% (placebo) ( p =0.76). Sixty-one and 46% of patients developed chronic GVHD in the placebo and the HCQ arms, respectively (p = 0.15). With a median follow-up of 18 months, relapse-free and overall survivals were comparable in both groups. In summary, in this randomized trial, the addition of HCQ to single agent CSA was not associated with a reduction of either acute or chronic GVHD; additionally, no significant effects on relapses or survival were observed.",
