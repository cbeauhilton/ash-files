    "abstract_text": "Malignant transformation is commonly associated with dysregulated ribosome biogenesis and for more than 100 years, pathologists have utilized the increase in size and number of nucleoli, the site of ribosome biogenesis, as a marker for aggressive malignancies (Hein et al., Trends in Molecular Medicine , 2013). Recently we demonstrated that hyperactivated RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) transcription, a rate limiting step in ribosome biogenesis, can be specifically targeted by the small molecule inhibitor, CX-5461 (Drygin et al., Cancer Research , 2011; Bywater et al. Cancer Cell, 2012 ). When evaluated for its anti-proliferative activity against a panel of genetically diverse human cancer cell lines, those derived from p53 wild type hematological malignancies were the most sensitive (Drygin et al., Cancer Research , 2011). Evaluation of whether Pol I transcription inhibition could serve as therapeutic strategy in vivo revealed that CX-5461 administration significantly prolongs the overall survival of Em-Myc lymphoma bearing mice. This survival advantage was associated with rapid activation of the ribosomal protein (Rp)-MDM2-p53 nucleolar stress response (Deisenroth et al., Oncogene , 2010) and subsequent induction of tumour cell-specific p53-dependent apoptosis; importantly the wild type B-cell population was maintained and did not activate p53 pathways (Bywater et al. Cancer Cell, 2012 ). To explore the therapeutic potential of Pol I transcription inhibition via CX-5461 in hematological malignancies refractory to standard chemotherapy, we employed mouse models of highly aggressive MLL-driven Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) (MLL/AF9 + Nras and MLL/ENL + Nras) (Zuber et al., Genes Dev , 2009) and V*\u03ba-Myc-driven Multiple Myeloma (MM) (Chesi et al. Cancer Cell , 2009). CX-5461 administration significantly increased the overall survival time of AML-bearing mice (MLL/ENL Nras median 17 days for vehicle vs 36 days for drug, P <0.0001 ( Figure 1 ); MLL/AF9 Nras median 15 days for vehicle vs 23 days for drug, P 0.0009) without severe adverse effects. The extended survival of MLL-driven AML bearing mice was associated with acute activation of p53, induction of cell death and an aberrant G2/M cell cycle progression, which consequently delayed tumour progression as monitored by bioluminescence-imaging and white blood cell counts (WBC). In contrast to CX-5461, standard-therapy with a regime containing Cytarabine/Doxorubicin (5:3) failed to induce p53 in MLL/ENL Nras AML-bearing mice, resulting in a significantly lower survival advantage as compared to animals treated with CX-5461 therapy. Figure 1 View large Download slide Figure 1 View large Download slide In ongoing experiments with MM-bearing mice, chronic CX-5461 administration robustly reduced the secretion of serum monoclonal Ig, as detected by serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), and significantly prolonged the overall survival time ( Figure 2 ) (V*\u03ba-Myc median >160 days for drug vs, 103.5 days for vehicle, ongoing) demonstrating that CX-5461 exhibits potent anti-tumour activity in MM model. Analysis of the molecular mechanism responsible for the therapeutic benefit of CX-5461 in MM is ongoing but appears to involve both p53 mediated apoptosis and aberrant cell cycle progression. Figure 2 View large Download slide Figure 2 View large Download slide These data demonstrate that hyperactivated Pol I transcription can be successfully targeted through small molecule inhibitors to treat models of human AML and MM that are refractory to standard therapy. Based on these and previously published results (Bywater et al., Cancer Cell, 2012), we have recently initiated a first-in-human, phase I, dose escalation clinical trial of this first-in-class drug, CX-5461 in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. The toxicity, response, pharmacokinetic and co-relative data from this trial will offer valuable insights as to whether inhibition of ribosome synthesis might offer a new non-genotoxic therapeutic approach in the fight against cancers, which are highly refractory to standard therapies.
