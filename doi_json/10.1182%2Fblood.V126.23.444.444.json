    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous disease that is characterized by the clonal expansion of myeloid progenitors that have impaired differentiation capacity. Determining the molecular machinery that regulate the survival and differentiation blockade of AML cells could serve as a foundation for designing novel therapies. PKC\u03b5 is a serine-threonine kinase belonging to the subgroup of the Protein Kinase C family called Novel PKCs. Aberrant PKC\u03b5 expression and activation is associated with the pathogenesis and chemotherapy resistance of many solid cancers. However, the contribution of PKC\u03b5 in blood malignances such as AML is not well defined. To evaluate the role of PKCe in AML biology, we employed short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated approaches to down-regulate PKC\u03b5 expression in human and murine AML cell lines. We found that shRNA-mediated knockdown of PKC\u03b5 significantly reduces the in vitro expansion of several human AML cell lines (MOLM-14, NOMO-1, OCI-AML3, THP-1 and U937). We also observed that blocking PKC\u03b5 induces caspase-3 cleavage and increases the number of annexin V-positive cells (P<0.05), suggesting that PKC\u03b5 antagonizes AML cell apoptosis. Additionally, we have also found that prior to cell death, AML cells expressing PKC\u03b5-targeting shRNAs display characteristics of myeloid differentiation. Specifically, down-regulation of PKC\u03b5 results in altered expression of the myeloid differentiation transcription factors C/EBPa and PU.1 and increased expression of the mature myeloid marker CD11b (P<0.001). Moreover, upon PKC\u03b5 inhibition, AML cells acquire morphological changes associated with differentiation, such as increased cytoplasmic volume, granule formation and nuclear segmentation. Interestingly, we observed similar phenotypic changes when we inhibited PKC\u03b5 expression in murine AML cell lines driven by the leukemogenic fusion protein MLL-AF9 alone (MLL-AF9) or in combination with the internal tandem duplication mutation of murine Flt3 (MLL-AF9;Flt3-ITD). Specifically, we observed that PKC\u03b5 down-modulation significantly reduces murine AML cell survival (P<0.001) and colony formation in methylcellulose (P<0.001) of both MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF9;Flt3-ITD cells compared to non-targeting shRNA-expressing cells. We are currently investigating how PKC\u03b5 inhibition impacts AML progression in vivo using mouse models of AML driven by MLL-AF9 or MLL-AF9;Flt3-ITD. At the molecular level, we have found that PKC\u03b5 is a key regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) biology in AML cells. Specifically, using a fluorogenic probe (CellRox) that indiscriminately detects most types of ROS, we have observed that PKC\u03b5 knockdown in human AML cell lines results in increased steady-state levels of intracellular ROS compared to shRNA control cells (P<0.002). Total intracellular ROS levels are influenced by the production and clearance of distinct ROS types in various cellular compartments. To further characterize the localization and specific type(s) of ROS regulated by PKC\u03b5, we utilized four redox-sensitive GFP (roGFP) probes, which allow for direct measurement of cytoplasmic and mitochrondrial glutathione redox potential (Grx1-roGFP-Cyto and Grx1-roGFP-Mito, respectively) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) levels (Orp1-roGFP-Cyto and Orp1-roGFP-Mito, respectively) in live cells. Down-modulation of PKC\u03b5 in NOMO-1 and OCI-AML-3 cells expressing each of these roGFP constructs resulted in a significant increase in the oxidation of Grx1-roGFP (P<.0007) and Orp1-roGFP-Mito (P<0.02) but not either of cytoplasmic constructs, suggesting that PKC\u03b5 regulates the production of ROS in the mitochondria of AML cells. Since increased H 2 O 2 production and glutathione oxidation results from increased superoxide (O 2 - ) production in mitochondria, we next evaluated the impact of PKC\u03b5 on O 2 - production. Using a fluorogenic probe (MitoSOX) that specifically detects O 2 - in live cells, we found that PKC\u03b5 down-modulation increases the production of O 2 - in AML cells (P<0.05). Our future studies are focused on determining the precise molecular events that connect alterations in redox biology with the survival and differentiation of AML cells. Collectively, these results uncover the previously unrecognized role of PKC\u03b5 as a critical regulator of mitochondrial redox biology and supporter of cell survival and impaired differentiation in AML.
