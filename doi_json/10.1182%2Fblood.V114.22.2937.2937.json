    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2937 Poster Board II-913 Enteropathy-associated T-cell Lymphoma (EATL) may complicate celiac disease (CD), refractory celiac disease type I (RCD I) characterized by normal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) or refractory celiac disease type II (RCD II) defined by abnormal IEL (CD3s-,CD3i+ and CD8-) and a clonal rearrangement of the gamma or delta chain of the T cell receptor (TCR\u03b3/\u03b4). It remains unknown whether the type of the associated enteropathy, non clonal (CD or RCD I) or clonal (RCD II), may be a prognostic factor in EATL. We aimed to assess the prognosis of EATL according to the type of the associated enteropathy. Medical files of 29 patients with EATL were retrospectively studied. The type of associated enteropathy was confirmed by immunohistochemistry analysis in all cases and by flow cytometry phenotyping analysis of freshly isolated IEL and search for a TCR \u03b3 or \u03b4 clonal rearrangement by Multiplex PCR whenever possible. Kaplan-Meier curves and Logrank test were used to compare survival of EATL in the 2 groups of enteropathy (clonal or not). Mean age at EATL (13 women / 16 men) onset was 57 years. The associated enteropathy was CD (n=10) or RCD I (n=2) in 12 patients and RCD II in 17 patients. No statistical difference was found in lymphoma staging with localized (IE and IIE) versus disseminated stages (IV) found in 42% and 58% of patients with CD or RCD I and in 53% and 47% of patients with RCD II, respectively. Diagnostic or therapeutic surgery was practiced in 83% and 47% of patients with CD or RCD I and with RCD II, respectively and chemotherapy in 92% and 82% of the same groups of patients, respectively (n.s). Considering all the EATL, the two-year and five-year survival rates of EATL were 34.1% and 20.2%, respectively. In subgroup analysis, the two-year and five-year survival rates of EATL were 66.7% and 53.3% in case of CD and/or RCD I and 11.8% and 0% in case of RCD II, respectively (p=0.0007). In conclusion, the type of enteropathy significantly impacts the prognosis of EATL with a particular short survival in case of associated RCD II enteropathy.
