    "abstract_text": "Background: The impact of prior salvage therapy with brentuximab vedotin (BV) for relapsed/ refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) on long-term outcomes after reduced intensity conditioned (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is unknown. Early studies (Chen et al Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 2014; 20: 1864-1868) suggested an improved 2-year progression free survival (PFS) with BV salvage given before allo-HCT compared to patients without prior BV treatment. In the current study, we analyzed the impact of prior therapy on the incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) and other major outcomes in patients, who received an RIC allo-HCT for relapsed HL. Methods: This is a retrospective study of relapsed/refractory HL patients who had RIC allo-HCT between 2005-2014 at the Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center. Patients were grouped according to prior history of salvage therapy with or without BV pre allo-HCT. Baseline patient characteristics are shown in the Table. Results: Of the 62 consecutive allo-HCT recipients in this study, 25 had prior therapy with BV (BV group) and 37 received other chemotherapy alone (No BV group) for relapsed HL before allo-HCT. More patients in the BV group were in complete remission at allo-HCT (Table). The 100 day acute GVHD and 5 year cGVHD incidence for the BV vs. no BV group were 58% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 39%-78%) vs. 65% (95% CI: 50%-80%), p=0.6 and 46% (95% CI: 26%-67%) vs. 51% (95% CI: 35%-68%), p=0.66, respectively. The 5 year non-relapse mortality and relapse/ progression for the BV vs. no BV group were 8% (95% CI: 1%-19%) vs. 25% (95% CI: 11%-38%), p=0.13 and 46% (95% CI: 24%-67%) vs. 38% (95% CI: 22%-53%), p0.98. The 5 year PFS and overall survival for BV vs. no BV group were 46% (95% CI: 25%-68%) vs. 38% (95% CI: 22%-53%), p=0.44 and 78% (95% CI: 60%-95%) vs. 56% (95% CI: 40%-72%), p=0.14. The major cause of death in both groups was relapsed HL. Conclusion: With longer follow-up, similar incidences of cGVHD, PFS and OS were observed in patients who received salvage therapy for relapsed/refractory HL prior to allo-HCT with or without BV. Any potential differences in cGVHD and other major outcomes need to be tested in a larger population. Table 1.  Characteristics . Prior treatment with Brentuximab vedotin . Yes N=25 . No N=37 .
