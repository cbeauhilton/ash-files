    "abstract_text": "Frequent pathway mutation involving multiple components of the RNA splicing machinery is a cardinal feature of myeloid neoplasms showing myeloid dysplasia, in which the major mutational targets include U2AF35, ZRSR2, SRSF2 and SF3B1 . Among these, SF3B1 mutations were strongly associated with MDS subtypes characterized by increased ring sideroblasts, such as refractory anemia and refractory cytopenia with multiple lineage dysplasia with ring sideroblasts, suggesting the critical role of SF3B1 mutations in these MDS subtypes. However, currently, the molecular mechanism of SF3B1 mutation leading to the ring sideroblasts formation and MDS remains unknown. The SF3B1 is a core component of the U2-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U2 snRNP), which recognizes the 3\u2032 splice site at intron\u2013exon junctions. It was demonstrated that Sf3b1 null mice were shown to be embryonic lethal, while Sf3b1 +/- mice exhibited various skeletal alterations that could be attributed to deregulation of Hox gene expression due to haploinsufficiency of Sf3b1 . However, no detailed analysis of the functional role of Sf3b1 in hematopoietic system in these mice has been performed. So, to clarify the role of SF3B1 in hematopoiesis, we investigated the hematological phenotype of Sf3b1 +/- mice. There was no significant difference in peripheral blood counts, peripheral blood lineage distribution, bone marrow total cellularity or bone marrow lineage composition between Sf3b1 +/+ and Sf3b1 +/- mice. Morphologic abnormalities of bone marrow and increased ring sideroblasts were not observed. However, quantitative analysis of bone marrow cells from Sf3b1 +/- mice revealed a reduction of the number of hematopoietic stem cells (CD34 neg/low, cKit positive, Sca-1 positive, lineage-marker negative: CD34-KSL cells) measured by flow cytometry analysis, compared to Sf3b1 +/+ mice. Whereas examination of hematopoietic progenitor cells revealed a small decrease in KSL cell populations and megakaryocyte - erythroid progenitors (MEP) in Sf3b1 +/- mice, and common myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocyte - monocyte progenitors (GMP) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) remained unchanged between Sf3b1 +/+ and Sf3b1 +/- mice. In accordance with the reduced number of hematopoietic stem cells in Sf3b1 +/- mice, the total number of colony-forming unit generated from equal number of whole bone marrow cells showed lower colony number in Sf3b1 +/- mice in vitro. Competitive whole bone marrow transplantation assay, which irradiated recipient mice were transplanted with donor whole bone marrow cells from Sf3b1 +/+ or Sf3b1 +/- mice with an equal number of competitor bone marrow cells, revealed impaired competitive whole bone marrow reconstitution capacity of Sf3b1 +/- mice in vivo . These data demonstrated Sf3b1 was required for hematopoietic stem cells maintenance. To further examine the function of hematopoietic stem cells in Sf3b1 +/- mice, we performed competitive transplantation of purified hematopoietic stem cells from Sf3b1 +/+ or Sf3b1 +/- mice into lethally irradiated mice together with competitor bone marrow cells. Sf3b1 +/- progenitors showed reduced hematopoietic stem cells reconstitution capacity compared to those from Sf3b1 +/+ mice. In serial transplantation experiments, progenitors from Sf3b1 +/- mice showed reduced repopulation ability in the primary bone marrow transplantation, which was even more pronounced after the second bone marrow transplantation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Sf3b1 plays an important role in normal hematopoiesis by maintaining hematopoietic stem cell pool size and regulating hematopoietic stem cell function. To determine the molecular mechanism underlying the observed defect in hematopoietic stem cells of Sf3b1 +/- mice, we performed RNA-seq analysis. We will present the results of our biological assay and discuss the relation of Sf3b1 and hematopoiesis. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
