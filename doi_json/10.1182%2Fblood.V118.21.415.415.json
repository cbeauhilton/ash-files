    "abstract_text": "Abstract 415 Background: Alteration of DNA methylation, a hallmark of epigenetic modification, is currently discussed as one important pathomechanism in leukemogenesis. Using a next-generation sequencing approach, a frameshift mutation of the gene encoding the DNA methyltransferase ( DNMT3A ) in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) case was identified. DNMT3A catalyses the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine residue of CpG dinucleotides, thereby affecting promoter methylation status and gene expression. Subsequent sequencing analysis in an independent cohort of 288 AML patients (pts) revealed DNMT3A mutations ( DNMT3A mut ) in 22% of the pts; mutations were associated with intermediate-risk cytogenetics and poor outcome. Aims: To evaluate frequency and clinical impact of DNMT3A mut in pts with AML aged 18 to 61 years who were treated within AMLSG treatment trials AML HD98A (Schlenk et al., J Clin Oncol 2010;28:4642\u20138) and AMLSG 07\u201304 ( NCT00151242 ). Methods: DNMT3A mutation analysis was performed in 1218 AML (HD98A, n=685; AMLSG 07\u201304, n=533; de novo AML, n=1102; s-AML, n=45; t-AML, n=69) using a DNA-based PCR assay for all coding exons (1 to 23) followed by direct sequencing. The median follow-up was 5.06 years. Results: DNMT3A mut were found with an overall frequency of 19.6% (239/1218); 189 mutations were located in the MTase domain clustering at amino acid R882 (79%). All but one mutation were heterozygous; only 4 cases had two mutations. DNMT3A sequence alterations included 17 frameshift, 4 nonsense, and 222 missense mutations. DNMT3A mut pts were significantly older ( P =.01), more frequently females ( P =.001), had higher white blood cell and platelet counts (both P <.0001), and higher bone marrow blasts percentage ( P =.001). DNMT3A mut were associated with cytogenetically-normal AML (CN-AML, P <.0001), while DNMT3A mut were rare in favorable and adverse-risk karyotypes ( P <.0001). Correlations with other molecular markers ( NPM1 , CEBPA , FLT3 , IDH1/2 , TET2, ASXL1 ) revealed a significant association with NPM1 ( P <.0001), FLT3 -ITD ( P <.0001), and IDH1/2 ( IDH1 R132 , P <.0001; IDH2 R140 , P =.0003; IDH2 R172 , P =.03) mutations, while co-occurrence of CEBPA ( P =.02) and ASXL1 ( P =.02) mutations was less frequent. DNMT3A mutational status did not impact complete remission (CR) rate, event-free (EFS) and relapse-free survival (RFS), neither in the whole cohort ( P =.09, P =.98, P =.11; respectively) nor in the subgroup of CN-AML ( P =.39, P =.79, P =.19, respectively). DNMT3A mut had a negative impact on overall survival (OS) in trend in the whole cohort ( P =.07) and significantly in CN-AML ( P =.02). In multivariable analyses, DNMT3A mut were in trend associated with a negative prognostic impact on OS (hazard ratio, 1.24; P =.06). In addition, we performed subgroup analyses according to (1) the NPM1 mutational status, and (2) the molecular risk groups of CN-AML (as defined by the European LeukemiaNet classification). DNMT3A mut did not impact OS in NPM1 -mutated patients in the whole cohort as well as in CN-AML ( P =.34; P =.22; respectively), while in NPM1 -wildtype patients DNMT3A mut were associated with inferior OS in both, the whole cohort and in CN-AML ( P =.001; P =.005; respectively). In molecular unfavorable CN-AML ( NPM1 -wildtype with or without FLT3 -ITD, NPM1 -mutated with FLT3 -ITD, CEBPA -wildtype), DNMT3A mut were significantly associated with worse OS ( P =.002) compared with DNMT3A -wildtype pts, even outweighing FLT3 -ITD as an unfavorable prognostic marker. There was no effect of DNMT3A mut in molecular favorable-risk CN-AML. Conclusions: DNMT3A mutations are confirmed as frequent genetic aberrations in AML, associated with normal karyotype, NPM1 , FLT3 -ITD, and IDH1/2 mutations. DNMT3A mut predicts for inferior outcome in molecularly-defined subsets of AML, that is, NPM1 -wildtype AML and molecular unfavorable CN-AML. As a single marker, DNMT3A mut only had a moderate effect on outcome. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
