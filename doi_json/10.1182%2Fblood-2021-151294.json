    "abstract_text": "Background: Integrins are \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunit heterodimeric receptors expressed ubiquitously on metazoan cells that play key roles in cell adhesion, movement, and signaling. The \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin on platelets is essential for thrombosis and hemostasis through its binding of fibrinogen and other ligands to mediate platelet adhesion and aggregation. The plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) domain is an approximately 54 amino acid sequence at the N-terminus of the \u03b23 subunit located in close proximity to the \"knee\" region. Our lab recently discovered that two \"CXXC\" motifs within PSI domains in the integrin family exert endogenous thiol isomerase activity, and blockade of this activity in \u03b23 integrin with our novel anti-PSI domain monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) significantly attenuated platelet adhesion and aggregation without impairing hemostasis ( Blood, 2017). Interestingly, intravital microscopy studies demonstrate that our anti-PSI antibodies inhibited thrombosis in vivo 10-30 fold more potent than their effects in vitro under anti-coagulant conditions, suggesting a possible inhibitory effect on blood coagulation. Notably, A L33P polymorphism (HPA-1b) within the \u03b23 integrin PSI domain is linked to an approximately two-fold increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), however, the underlying mechanism for this remains unclear. Methods/Results: To investigate the role of PSI domain in blood coagulation, we first employed thromboelastography (TEG) to compare our anti-PSI domain mAbs with other anti-\u03b23 mAbs that do not directly bind to \u03b23 PSI domain. Results show that anti-PSI domain mAbs inhibited blood coagulation in human and murine whole blood or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) significantly more than anti-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 antibodies JAN-D1, M1, and Abciximab precursor 7E3. To address whether the L33P polymorphism affects PSI domains thiol isomerase activity, we generated L33P PSI domain via site-directed mutagenesis in E. coli . Using a scrambled RNase assay, we found that L33P polymorphism enhanced thiol-isomerase activity relative to WT PSI domain. We further corroborated these findings through an insulin \u03b2 chain reduction assay, and a MPB (N-Maleimidopropionyl-biocytin) western blot assay, which quantifies thiol isomerase activity through MPB binding to free thiols that have not been oxidized into RNase. Interestingly, TEG results show that recombinant human PSI domain enhanced blood coagulation in platelet-microparticle (PMP) free plasma, which was generated through high-speed centrifugation (17,000 x g) of platelet poor plasma (PPP)for 15 minutes that removed residual platelets and microparticles . Conclusion: We have discovered a novel role of integrin \u03b23 PSI domain in blood coagulation, which is enhanced by the L33P polymorphism (HPA-1b). These data highlight the \u03b23 PSI domain as a suitable therapeutic target for its roles in both platelet adhesion/aggregation, and blood coagulation. Furthermore, these data may explain the increased risk of CVD such as myocardial infarction and deep vein thrombosis for individuals with the L33P polymorphism.
