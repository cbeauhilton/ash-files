    "abstract_text": "Introduction Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare and aggressive hematological malignancy with multi-organ and frequent skin involvement, and poor clinical outcomes. Based on the limited available data, the estimated incidence is 0.44% of all hematologic malignancies, representing less than 1% of acute leukemias, and 0.7% of cutaneous lymphomas. Due to the rarity of this entity, there have been relatively few studies characterizing the molecular profile of BPDCN. We examined a cohort of 51 patients with BPDCN using OncoScan chromosome microarray, which provides genome-wide copy number abnormality (CNA) analysis. Methods An international cohort of BPDCN cases were collected from centers in Brazil (Laboratorio de Patologia, Botucatu), Swtizerland (University of Zurich), France (Hospital St. Louis, Paris), Peru (Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas, Lima), Canada (Department of Pathology, University of Montreal), Italy (Derpartment of Pathology, University of Bologna), and US (Department of Pathology - The Ohio State University, Department of Hematopathology - MD Anderson Cancer Center; and Department of Pathology - University of Virginia). A total of 58 tissue blocks from 51 patient samples were retrieved. The diagnosis of BPDCN was done and confirmed by at least three independent hematopathologists or dermatopathologists in accordance with the WHO classification (Lyon 2017). For the purpose of the molecular analysis substratification, cases were classified as 'BPDCN' if they were positive for TCF4, and 'BPDCN-like' if they were negative for TCF4. Immunohistochemistry for CD123, CD4, and CD56 was performed in all cases. Exclusion criteria included expression of MPO, lysozyme, CD3, CD19, CD20, CD22, and/or EBV. DNA was extracted from FFPE samples via standard techniques and processed on OncoScan CNV Plus microarray (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to manufacturer's recommended protocol. Copy number abnormalities and select single nucleotide variants and insertions/deletions (74 mutations in 9 genes) were analyzed on Chromosome Analysis Suite software (ChAS v4.1; ThermoFisher Scientific). Additional analysis was performed using Nexus Copy Number (BioDiscovery, version 10.0). Results To date, we have successfully analyzed 45 cases of BPDCN with Oncoscan, revealing widespread CNA in the vast majority of cases (44/45; 98%). Alterations of chromosome 9 were common in this cohort, particularly CNAs involving CDKN2A/B at 9p21.3. Twenty-five cases (56%) demonstrated CNA including CDKN2A/B , with ten of these cases demonstrating a homozygous loss of CDKN2A/B (22%). Alterations of chromosome 13 were also frequently detected with loss of RB1 (located at 13q14.2) detected in 24 cases (53%). The RUNX1 gene (21q22.12) was a common target of CNAs in this cohort, seen in nine cases (20%). Eight of these cases showed a copy number gain of RUNX1 , which is a recurrent finding in a variety of hematological malignancies, particularly myeloid neoplasms. The remaining case with RUNX1 CNA showed a focal, homozygous loss of the gene, demonstrating that dysregulation of RUNX1 through CNA is a common event in BPDCN. We observed frequent deletions of ETV6 (53%), IKZF1 (33%), and TP53 (16%) in our cohort. The ARHGAP26 gene (5q31.3), which is associated primarily with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, was included in CNA in 13 cases (29%), with both gains and losses observed in this cohort. Oncoscan can detect a limited number of single nucleotide variants in nine genes that are frequently mutated in cancers ( BRAF, EGFR, IDH1, IDH2, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, and TP53 ). Mutations were detected in ten cases (22%), with NRAS and TP53 variants detected in three cases each and KRAS and IDH2 variants detected in two cases each. Conclusions Our preliminary data demonstrates complex genomic alterations in BPDCN, with the RB1 locus on chromosome 13, the CDKN2A/B locus on chromosome 9, and the ETV6 locus on chromosome 12 most commonly detected. However, widespread genomic alterations were detected involving a variety of cancer-associated genes further characterizing CNA in BPDCN. Analysis of additional BPDCN cases is progress.
