    "abstract_text": "Iron overload, a potentially serious consequence of multiple blood transfusions, can be effectively managed with chelation therapy. Deferasirox, an investigational once-daily oral chelator, has been evaluated in a 1 year study of iron-overloaded adult and pediatric patients (n=184) with transfusion-dependent anemia including \u03b2-thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA). Patients were stratified into four daily dose groups (5, 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg) according to baseline liver iron concentration (LIC; 2\u20133, >3\u20137, >7\u201314 and >14 mg Fe/g dw, respectively). Iron balance was determined for all patients, based on transfusional iron intake and chelator-induced iron excretion, derived from the change in LIC during the study (Table 1).

However, LIC and serum ferritin decreases were consistently achieved in all patient groups. More than one-third (38%) of patients, most of whom had MDS or other anemias, had an iron intake rate <0.3 mg/kg/day (average: 0.2 mg/kg/day; corresponding to 5.6 ml RBC/kg/month). In these patients, deferasirox at 10 and 20 mg/kg reduced LIC. Overall, an iron intake- and dose-related response pattern was observed for both LIC and serum ferritin (Figure 1).

In conclusion, dosing of chelation therapy should be guided by a patient\u2019s transfusion requirements and the treatment goal, which is either to maintain or reduce body iron.",
