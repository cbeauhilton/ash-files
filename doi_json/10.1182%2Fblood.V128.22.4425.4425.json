    "abstract_text": "We and others previously demonstrated an increased risk of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) in first-degree relatives of multiple myeloma (MM) and MGUS patients, underscoring a familial component to this disease. However, MM is known to be a collection of cytogenetically distinct diseases, with 40-50% of MM cases having a reciprocal translocation involving the IgH locus on chromosome 14q32 and in many of the remaining patients, trisomies. In a small proportion of cases, both IgH abnormalities and trisomies are found in the same clone. These MM cytogenetic subtypes are associated with differential prognosis. Whether there are differences in familial risk by cytogenetic subtypes is not known. Patients with MM were recruited from the Mayo Clinic Hematology practice in Rochester, Minnesota (MN) between 2005 and 2015. Serum samples were collected from first-degree relatives and subjected to electrophoresis and immunofixation for MGUS determination. Age- and sex-specific rates of MGUS from the population-based Olmsted County, MN, prevalence study were used as expected rates for the calculation of risk ratios (RRs) for comparisons of first-degree relatives. Cytogenetic subtypes were classified by FISH testing performed in the clinic and categorized into groups defined by IgH translocation , trisomy, intermediate/ high-risk disease (t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), and del17p). Further, the distribution of cytogenetic subtypes was compared between MM cases with and without evidence of MGUS in first degree relatives using Chi square tests. Analyses were also subset to MM probands diagnosed in MN. There were a total of 442 MM probands, with 1235 first-degree relatives recruited and eligible for the study. MGUS was detected in 78 relatives, for an age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of 6.1% (4.7%-7.5%). Analyses comparing prevalence of MGUS in first degree relatives to population-based rates from Olmsted County showed a 2.5-fold (95% CI=1.9-3.0) increased prevalence. When performing analyses among MN probands only (RR=2.9; 95% CI=2.1-3.8), results were similar. Of the 442 probands, 310 had FISH performed on plasma cells (identified by cIG staining; cIg-FISH) at diagnosis. Of these cases, 49% had a trisomy, 23% had an IgH translocation, and 9% had both. Although the proportion of trisomies and IgH translocations were 4-6% higher among MM probands with a relative with MGUS compared to those without, these differences were not statistically significant (Table 1). MM probands with a first degree relative with MGUS also had a similar proportion of cytogenetic subtypes that are considered of intermediate or high risk compared to those MM without a family history (26.9% vs 25.2%) (p=0.79) (Table 1). When restricted to MM probands from MN, results remained non-statistically significant (Table 1). We showed an increased risk of MGUS in first-degree relatives of MM cases, implying shared environment and/or genetics underlying this malignancy. However, we did not find an association between family history of MGUS in MM probands and the cytogenetic subtypes examined. Larger cohorts are needed to examine if a relationship exists between cytogenetic subtypes of MM and familial risk.
