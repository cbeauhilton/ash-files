    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients with Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in approximately 40% of cases suffer from primary refractory disease and treatment induced immuno-chemotherapy resistance demonstrating that standard provided treatment regimens are not sufficient to cure all patients. Early detection of resistance is of great importance and defining microRNA (miRNA) involvement in resistance could be useful to guide treatment selection and help monitor treatment administration while sparing patients for inefficient, but still toxic therapy. Concept and Aims: With information on drug-response specific miRNAs, we hypothesized that multi-miRNA panels can improve robustness of individual clinical markers and serve as a prognostic classifier predicting disease progression in DLBCL patients. Methods: Fifteen DLBCL cell lines were tested for sensitivity towards rituximab (R), cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (H), and vincristine (O). Cell line specific seeding concentrations was used to ensure exponential growth and each cell line was subjected to 16 concentrations in serial 2-fold dilutions and number of metabolic active cells was evaluated after 48 hours of drug exposure using MTS assay. For each drug, we ranked the cell lines according to their sensitivity and categorized them as sensitive, intermediate responsive, or resistant. Differential miRNA expression analysis between sensitive and resistant cell lines identified 43 miRNAs to be associated with response to compounds of the R-CHOP regimen, by selecting probes with a log fold change larger than 2. Baseline miRNA expression data were obtained for each cell line in untreated condition, and differential miRNA expression analysis identified 43 miRNAs associated to response to R-CHOP. Using the Affymetrix HG-U133+2 platform, expression levels of the miRNA precursors were assessed in 701 diagnostic DLBCL biopsies, and miRNA-panel classifiers were build using multiple Cox regression or random survival forest. Results: Generated prognostic miRNA-panel classifiers were tested for predictive accuracies and were subsequently evaluated by Brier scores and time varying area under the ROC curves (tAUC). Progression-free survival (PFS) was chosen as the outcome, since it is a treatment evaluation parameter as closely as possible to the time of drug exposure and the tested miRNAs were all associated directly to drug specific response. Furthermore, overall survival (OS) was used for verification of findings. Comparison of analyses conducted for the respective cohorts (All DLBCL, ABC, and GCB patients) showed the lowest prediction errors for all models within the GCB subclass with a multivariate Cox miRNA-panel model including miR-146a, miR-155, miR-21, miR-34a, and miR-23a~miR-27a~miR-24-2 cluster performed the best and successfully stratified GCB-DLBCL patients into high- and low-risk of disease progression. In addition, combination of the miRNA-panel and international prognostic index (IPI) substantially increased prognostic performance in GCB classified patients, indicating a prognostic signal from the response-specific miRNAs independent of IPI. In conclusion: We found as proof of concept that adding gene expression data detecting drug-response specific miRNAs to the clinically established IPI improved the prognostic stratification of GCB-DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP.
