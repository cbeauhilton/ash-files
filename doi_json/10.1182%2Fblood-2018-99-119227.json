    "abstract_text": "Autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting B-Cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA) have demonstrated promising clinical activity, inducing durable responses in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Development of autologous CAR T therapies is however limited by logistical challenges and the time required for manufacturing, which has to be done for each patient. In addition, manufacturing may not be feasible in some patients. An allogeneic approach that utilizes engineered cells from a healthy donor could potentially expand patient access to these therapies by providing a readily available off-the-shelf product. We have previously described the screening of a library of single chain variable fragments (scFvs) with high affinity to human BCMA and the identification of candidate BCMA CARs with potent antitumor activity. Here we sought to further characterize ALLO-715, our lead allogeneic BCMA CAR T cell product, for its specificity to human BCMA, antitumor efficacy in vitro using a long-term killing assay and in xenograft mouse models with physiologic levels of human IL-7 and IL-15, and suitability for scale-up manufacturing. Allogeneic ALLO-715 CAR T cells were generated by lentiviral transduction with a second generation CAR construct incorporating a novel scFv derived from a fully-human antibody with high affinity to BCMA (K D value ~ 5 nM, determined at 37\u00b0C) and featuring a rituximab-driven off-switch. Transduced T cells were then transfected with mRNAs encoding Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALEN\u00ae) designed to specifically disrupt the T cell receptor alpha chain and CD52 loci. These modifications result in a cell product with a lower risk of TCR-mediated graft-versus-host disease and resistance to the CD52 antibody alemtuzumab, a lymphodepleting agent. BCMA CAR T cells exhibited robust cell expansion, with low levels of tonic signaling that resulted in minimal differentiation (> 50% Tscm/Tcm phenotype). In in vitro assays, ALLO-715 CAR T cells displayed potent cytotoxic activity when co-cultured with the target cell lines MM.1S, Molp-8, and BCMA-REH but negligible cytotoxicity against BCMA-negative REH cells. The high proliferative potential indicated by the high frequency of memory T cells was validated in long-term killing assays, where ALLO-715 CAR T cells showed substantial expansion in the presence of MM.1S cells with no evidence of exhaustion or diminished cytolytic activity after seven days of continuous exposure to target. The potency of ALLO-715 CAR T cells was unaffected by high concentrations of soluble BCMA (>10 ug/mL), which has been shown previously to interfere with the activity of some BCMA-specific CARs. In MM xenograft mouse models, ALLO-715 CAR T cells were highly efficacious at single dose. High serum IL-15 levels have been associated with CAR T cell expansion in clinical trials. To evaluate the impact of homeostatic cytokines on CAR T cell survival and antitumor activity in our xenograft models, mice were administered adeno-associated viruses (AAV) for the expression of human IL-7 and IL-15. In the presence of physiological concentrations of these cytokines, enhanced BCMA CAR T cell expansion and anti-tumor activity were observed. To assess potential off-target interactions of ALLO-715 CAR, tissue cross-reactivity studies were carried out on standard human tissue panels using a scFv-human IgG fusion protein. Consistent with the limited expression pattern of BCMA, reactivity was seen on scattered cells in lymphoid tissues such as tonsil and abundantly on BCMA-expressing cell lines, but no appreciable staining was detected in other tissues. We examined BCMA CAR T cells manufactured following a proprietary GMP-like clinical scale process and found that cell expansion and viability, T cell phenotype and in vivo antitumor efficacy were preserved. These results demonstrate the potential of ALLO-715 as a novel allogeneic BCMA CAR T therapy for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MM and other BCMA-positive malignancies.
