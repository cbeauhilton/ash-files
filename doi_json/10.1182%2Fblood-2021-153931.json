    "abstract_text": "Efforts have been made to identify modulators of increasing fetal hemoglobin (HbF - \u03b12\u02632) that may act as promising targets for hemoglobinopathies, such as in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. The inositide PI5P is a second messenger from the inositol pathway that comprehends in the main phosphorylation target of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-5-kinase-II-alpha (PIPKII\u03b1), found in high concentrations in the erythrocyte. Some evidences have postulated a relation between this enzyme and the expression of the hemoglobin (Hb) genes (1,2). More recently, PI5P was found to stabilize UHRF1 protein (3), which has been reported as a possible repressor of HBG (from \u0263 globin gene), in the switch from \u0263 to \u03b2 in the transition HbF- HbA (4). To evaluate the effects of the inositide PI5P (substrate of PIPKII\u03b1) in globins, a preliminary time course experiment was performed. KU812 cells (ATCC CRL-2099), which express all three globin genes ( HBA, HBB and HBG ), were treated with 1\u03bcM of PI5P (Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA) in triplicate (4, 8 and 12 hours of treatment) - time 0h used as control. Gene expression and protein concentrations were determined by qPCR - SYBR Green Master Mix amplification and detection kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA, in equipment StepOnePlus Real Time PCR System, Applied Biosystems - USA) using 2DDCT method with the ACTB and GAPDH genes as internal controls - and immunoblotting. Primers were design according to Zacariotto et al (2). No additional phosphate was imputed into the cell culture and the ATP consumption was monitored by ATP Determination Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EUA). PI5P treatment resulted in significant increasement of HBG RNA transcripts (p= 0.001; 8 hours / treatment) and decrease of PIP4K2A (from PIPKII\u03b1 enzyme) (p=0.02; 12 hours / treatment), with no other significant changes into globin genes ( HBA and HBB ). At the protein level, there was a prominent increase in \u0263 globin concentrations according to time course. No other consistent change in the concentrations of PIPKII\u03b1 or globin chains were observed. Due to protein similarities between the subfamilies of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate kinases (PIPKins) (5), the gene expression of these enzymes was also monitored by qPCR. There was a significant reduction of PIP5K1A (from PIPKI\u03b1 enzyme) (p=0.01 - 4h; p=0.01 - 8h, and p=0.009 - 12h) as well as PIP4K2B (from PIPKII\u03b2 enzyme) (p=0.03 - 4 hours/ treatment). No significant changes were observed in the other PIPKins (PIPKI\u03b2, PIPKI\u0263, PIPKII\u0263 and PIPKIII). Considering that a significant consumption of intracellular ATP was observed in time course (p=0.006) it is possible to infer that the high concentrations of PI5P have shifted the inositol pathway resulting in the downregulation of its own PIPKin genes and culminating into the upregulation of HBG , reflected into the protein level. The mechanisms involving the inositide as second messenger, the role of PIPKins or other genes into the modulation of hemoglobin genes, particularly in HBG , should be further investigated. However, despite preliminary, these results reinforce the involvement of the PIPKins and its molecular targets (mainly PIPKI\u03b1 and PI5P) in globin gene regulation and could represent a promising target for future therapeutic target for hemoglobinopathies.
