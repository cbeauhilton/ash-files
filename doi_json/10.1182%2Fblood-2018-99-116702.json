    "abstract_text": "Background: Nearly 5% of patients diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma have the nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), also known as Hodgkin paragranuloma or lymphocytic and histiocytic predominant Hodgkin disease. Given the rarity of this variant of Hodgkin lymphoma, there is no consensus on the standard of care/regimen in this subgroup of patients. Therapeutic approach has spanned from radiotherapy alone, combined chemo-radiotherapy to chemotherapy alone or observation and recently the use of Rituximab anti CD20 monoclonal antibody as these cells expresses CD20 marker. We opt to evaluate the outcome of patients with newly diagnosed NLPHL in our institution. We also reviewed outcome of NLPHL patients treated with various chemotherapy such as ABVD, CVP or RCHOP \u00b1 Radiation. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of over 300 patients [mean age 45 (13-76)] with Hodgkin Lymphoma at Beaumont Hospital, an academic community center from January 2007 - January 2017. Given the rarity of the disease, a total of 13 patients were found to have pathologically confirmed diagnosis of NLPHL. Data regarding age, sex, stage of disease, treatment and outcome was analyzed. Results: Total 13 patients with NLPHL with age range from 13 to 80 years were studied. Demographic distribution of studied patients were 8(62%) white, 4 (31%) African Americans and 1 (7.6%) Asian. Out of these, 8 (62%) were males and 5 (38%) females. A total of 9 (69%) patients have stage III disease on diagnosis while 4 (31%) patients had stage II disease on diagnosis. Out of 9 patients with stage III disease, 6 (67%) received chemotherapy alone (ABVD or CVP) whereas 3 (33%) received combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. One patient in the chemotherapy alone arm, recurred within 24 months of treatment and received local therapy with radiation. Among those with stage II disease on diagnosis, 3 patients received radiation therapy alone while one patient was observed and did not receive any treatment. Overall, out of 13 patients studied, 12 (92%) are still alive and continues to follow with our clinic with no recorded relapse to date. One patient developed astrocytoma grade III and died of intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Although the standard therapeutic management for patients with NLPHL remains controversial. Our data showed that regardless of the regimen selected (chemotherapy alone or combined chemo-Radiotherapy), patients with Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma treated with ABVD \u00b1 Radiation have excellent outcome. Although our study represents a single institutional analysis, it concurs with recent studies that clinical outcome in patients with NLPHL is favorable with chemotherapy.
