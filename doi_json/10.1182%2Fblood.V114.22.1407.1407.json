To compare the requirements of physicians and patients for the Internet interactive service which allows patients to manage their own medical records and communicate with physician via the Internet. Background. USA federal rule defining \u201cthe Meaningful Use of Electronic Health Records\u201d is similar to that of the National Standard of Russian Federation \u201cThe Electronic Case History (EHR)\u201d, operating since 2008. This National Standard was developed based on experience of EHR system at the National Center for Hematology in Moscow (NCH). In 2009, we started the Personal Health Records service (PHR service) that allows patients to manage their own medical records and have internet-based communication with physicians. Simple interface for patients which blocks the full capacity of the PHR service is similar to that of EHR system of NCH. It permits integrated data presentations on a uniform axis of time and access to additional information (reported to ASH in 2001). The PHR service raises question of \u201cmeaningful use\u201d requirements not only for EHR provider organization, but for the service users - patients and doctors. Methods. Using questionnaires and interviews, we compared expectations and acceptance of the PHR service by doctors and their patients. Results and Discussion. Preliminary results indicate that doctors are more likely to use the PHR service than the System of HER. Although the entire format of PHR service is familiar to physicians at NCH, they mostly use its information capabilities (viewing the results of the analysis, making appointments for research and planning patient's visits). The patients use PHR service with great enthusiasm (increasing with younger age and higher level of education). The complexity of integration interfaces, which we leave for the patients in the second term, gives them more inspiration than that the physicians. However, few patients take seriously the responsibilities that exist in relation to the accurate maintenance of their records. Conclusion. PHR can be widely used if integration of sources for medical information and unification format can simplify the \u201cmanual\u201d work of PHR management.
