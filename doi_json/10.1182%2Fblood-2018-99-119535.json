    "abstract_text": "Background The development of therapy-related AML (t-AML) is a rare but fatal complication of cancer therapies, with varying leukemogenicity associated with individual chemotherapies and radiation modalities. In recent years, there is an increase in t-AML incidence explained by increased use of cancer therapies and increased cancer survivorship. We investigated changes in t-AML outcomes over time among cancer patients (pts) treated with chemotherapy and radiation using data from population-based cancer registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program of the US. Methods A previously validated R package (SEERaBomb) was used to query all 18 SEER registries to identify adult pts (\u226515 years) with multiple types of primary malignancies who were treated with chemotherapy and radiation, and subsequently developed AML. Pts were observed from the date of first diagnosis of a primary malignancy until occurrence of AML as a second cancer, death, loss to follow-up or end of the study period, whichever occurred earlier. Cases of AML that developed at least 1 year following diagnosis and treatment of a primary malignancy were classified as t-AML. Primary cancers associated with at least 100 t-AML cases were included. Survival probabilities were compared for pts with: (1) primary cancers which did and did not subsequently develop AML, (2) primary ( de novo ) AML, and t-AML. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with overall survival (OS) in the t-AML cohort, including the following covariates: age group [adolescents and young adults (AYA) (15-39 years); middle-aged (40-59); and older adults (\u226560)], sex, year of diagnosis, race, primary cancer type, and whether or not treatment was received for t-AML. Tests of significance were based on two-sided hypothesis at the .05 level. Results A total of 1,425,840 adult cancer pts diagnosed between the years 1973-2015 were assembled from all 18 SEER registries which included 1,392,784 primary cancers, 31,112 primary AML cases and 1,944 t-AML cases [breast (781), lung (205), lymphoma (612), and prostate (346)]. Median survival of t-AML in months (m) with (range) by primary site was as follows: breast: 5.5m (0.5-263); lymphoma: 4.5m (0.5-255.5); lung: 1.5m (0.5-178.5); and prostate: 3.5m (0.5-196.5); combined: 3.5m (0.5-263). Median latency periods in years (y) with (range) to develop t-AML were as follows: breast: 3y (1-38); lymphoma: 4y (1-30); lung: 2y (1-22); and prostate: 4y (1-18); combined: 4y (1-39) . Figure 1 shows comparison of survival probabilities of primary malignancies with and without subsequent development of t-AML over three time periods (1973-1990, 1991-2005 and 2006-2015) organized by year of diagnosis and primary cancer type. Development of t-AML was significantly associated with worse survival for all the four primaries that contribute to the bulk of t-AML cases. Figure 2 shows survival probabilities of primary ( de novo ) AML versus t-AML (all pooled cases). In multivariate analyses, the hazard ratio (HR) of death was significantly higher in older adults [ vs AYA, 1.39 (95% CI 1.11-1.75)] but not middle-aged adults [ vs AYA, 0.931 (95% CI 0.738-1.175)], lower in other races [ vs Caucasian, 0.81 (95% CI 0.66-0.988)] but not in African Americans [ vs Caucasian, 1.078 (95% CI 0.917-1.267)] and lower in those diagnosed between the years 2006-2015 [ vs 1973-1990, 0.69 (95% CI 0.58-0.82)]. Pts treated for their t-AML had a HR of death significantly lower than those who did not receive treatment [0.426 (95% CI 0.38-0.47)]. There was no significant difference in HR between male and female patients [0.971 (95% CI 0.839-1.123)]. When analyzed by treatment periods, there was no difference noted between the time periods 1973-1990 and 1991-2005 [0.878 (95% CI 0.737-1.045)]. Among primary cancer type, only those t-AML cases preceded by lung cancers had a significantly higher HR of death {[lung vs breast, 1.56 (95% CI 1.27-1.92)]; [lymphoma vs breast, 1.006 (95% CI 0.847-1.194)]; [prostate vs breast, 0.861 (95% CI 0.679-1.093)]. Conclusions In our population based analysis, we show that although the OS of t-AML is significantly worse than primary AML, those t-AML diagnosed and treated in recent years (2006-2015) had significantly better survival compared to earlier treatment periods. Among all primaries, outcomes of t-AML particularly following lung cancers are dismal compared to other primaries.
