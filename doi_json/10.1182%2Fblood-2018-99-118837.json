    "abstract_text": "Inherited thrombocytopenia is a group of hereditary diseases with a reduction in platelet count as the main clinical manifestation. Clinically, there is an urgent need for a convenient and rapid diagnosis method. We introduced a high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform into the routine diagnosis of patients with unexplained thrombocytopenia and analyzed the gene sequencing results to evaluate the value of NGS technology in the screening and diagnosis of inherited thrombocytopenia. From a cohort of 182 patients with thrombocytopenia, we screened 78 patients with hereditary features. For the blood samples of these 78 patients, a gene sequencing platform for hemorrhagic and thrombotic diseases comprising 89 genes was used to perform gene detection using NGS technology. When we combined the screening results with clinical features and other findings, 23 of 78 patients (29.5%) were diagnosed with inherited thrombocytopenia. In addition, 29 pathogenic variants, including 11 previously unreported variants, were identified in these patients. In summary, NGS could play more important role in the molecular pathology diagnosis of inherited thrombocytopenia. Through the use of this detection platform, we expect to establish a more effective diagnostic approach to such disorders. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
