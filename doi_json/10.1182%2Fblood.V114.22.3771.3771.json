    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3771 Poster Board III-707 High throughput screening of compounds comprising the Memorial Sloan Kettering chemical library resulted in several confirmed hits against the recombinant Cdc7:Dbf4 heterodimeric kinase, a key regulator in the initiation of DNA replication and the G1 to S phase transition. Chemoinformatic analysis of the hits revealed an enrichment in one chemical cluster made up of several naturally occurring compounds, of which the most potent compound, CKI-7, was selected for further investigation. First, CKI-7 was found to be a non competitive inhibitor for ATP and prompted us to prolife it against a panel of 200 known kinases in order to assess its selectivity profile. The results were as predicted and very few kinases were specifically affected. Second, CKI-7 cytotoxic activity was assessed against a panel of well established cancer cell lines representing both hematopoietic and solid tumor malignancies as well as against a panel of primary hematopoietic cells derived from leukemia patients (both chemotherapy nai\u0308ve and relapsed/refractory samples) and was found to be a very effective agent with potencies in the low nanomolar range. Subsequent studies using an isogenic pair of cell lines with one over expressing the Bcl_xL anti-apoptotic protein further confirmed the induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway via caspase-3 activation in the absence and attenuation of the activity in the presence of Bcl_xL. This was further demonstrated through standard cell cycle synchronization studies revealing that exposure to the Cdc7 inhibitor results in an S phase arrest, cell cycle dependent caspase-3 activation, and apoptotic cell death. This cell death is the direct result of Cdc7 kinase inhibition by CKI-7 as demonstrated using a Cdc7 substrate biomarker assay. Third, the physicochemical properties of this class of naturally occurring compounds also prompted us to investigate their effect on several multidrug resistence (MDR) over-expressing cell lines. We found that CKI-7 was not a substrate for the efflux pumps demonstrating that this novel compound can overcome a major mechanism of chemotherapy resistence in human tumor cells. Based of the above observations, in vivo dose-dependent anti-tumor activity of CKI-7 was subsequently demonstrated in a SCID-Beige mouse systemic tumor model utilizing a recently isolated Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (PhALL3.1). Taken together, our data confirm that Cdc7 is a new promising target for cancer therapy, and that the newly discovered inhibitor CKI-7, a naturally occurring selective small molecule inhibitor of this enzyme, is an equally promising novel cancer therapeutic agent.
