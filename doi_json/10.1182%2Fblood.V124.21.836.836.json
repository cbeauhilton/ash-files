    "abstract_text": "Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are found in most aggressive myeloid diseases and contribute to therapeutic resistance. LSCs are characterized by their gain of a self-renewal program that is normally associated with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Previously we have shown that the RNA binding protein, Msi2 contributes to both HSC and myeloid leukemia function. Elevated MSI2 expression predicts a poor prognosis in a variety of leukemias and shRNA-mediated depletion in human AML cell lines reduces proliferation, increases differentiation and induces apoptosis. Despite these in vitro and correlative studies, MSI2\u2019s molecular mechanism is not known and its role in LSC function has not been assessed. To elucidate MSI2\u2019s role in LSC function, we utilized the MLL-AF9 leukemia mouse model. Initially we found MSI2 was elevated in the LSC enriched compartment (c-Kit High cells) compared to non-LSCs (c-Kit Low cells) based on flow cytometric intracellular staining. Therefore, to establish a model to study Msi2 and its contribution to myeloid LSCs, we have utilized the Msi2 conditional knockout mice that we previously crossed ( Msi2 f/f ) into an Mx1-Cre background to generate the Msi2 \u0394 / \u0394 allele (injection of polyinositol-polycytosine; pIpC). In order to test if Msi2 is critical for MLL-AF9 mediated initiation, we transduced control Msi2 f/f and Msi2 \u0394 / \u0394 Lin - Sca1 + c-Kit + cells (LSKs) with MLL-AF9 expressing retroviruses co-expressing GFP. Msi2 deleted LSKs or granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) transduced with MLL-AF9 demonstrated delayed leukemogenesis with dramatically reduced diseased burden. Msi2 deficient leukemias were found to have a 4-fold reduced phenotypic LSC population and were more differentiated based on cellular morphology. Msi2 deficient leukemias failed to transplant into secondary recipients demonstrating that Msi2 is required for maintaining LSCs. Deletion of Msi2 after leukemia engraftment led to a delay in leukemogenesis indicating that Msi2 is also important for leukemia maintenance. Gene expression profiling of the Msi2 ablated LSCs resulted in a loss of the HSC/LSC program and an increase in differentiation gene sets. The gene signature from the Msi2 deleted murine LSCs (121 genes) was overlapped and subjected to unsupervised clustering with the gene expression profiles from 336 AML patients (ECOG1900 dataset). This analysis resulted in distinct clusters that had differential MSI2 expression and the MSI2 \u201chigh\u201d cluster predicted a worse clinical outcome when compared to the other clusters. Overlapping of the differential transcriptional analysis of the Msi2 deleted murine LSCs with our global MSI2 direct mRNA targets (HITS-CLIP) led us to identify that MSI2 binds to transcripts that are associated with the downstream MLL self-renewal program, including Myc and Ikzf2 . Ikzf2 is a member of the Ikaros transcription factor family and is known to regulate lymphocyte development by controlling regulatory T-cell function and chromatin remodeling. Ikzf2 shRNA mediated depletion resulted in reduced colony formation, decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. The MLL associated targets were also reduced, which included Bcl-2 and Hoxa9 . In contrast to its tumor suppressor role in hypodiploid B-ALL, these results suggest that Ikzf2 contributes to MLL leukemia cell maintenance. Thus, we provide evidence that MSI2 maintains the oncogenic LSC epigenetic program and the rationale for clinically targeting MSI2 in myeloid leukemia.
