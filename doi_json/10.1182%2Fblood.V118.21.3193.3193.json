    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3193 The switch from embryonic to fetal hemoglobin (HbF, \u03b12\u03b32) in utero, and from fetal to adult hemoglobin at birth is well documented and achieved by the sequential activation of \u03b5, \u03b3 and \u03b4/\u03b2 genes at the \u03b2 globin gene ( HBB ) cluster. A change in the expression of hemoglobin genes also take place in adult erythropoiesis: earlier erythroid progenitors have been shown to produce significant amounts of fetal hemoglobin, while the more mature progenitors contain essentially none. In keeping with the sequential activation of \u03b2-like globin genes, \u03b4 globin chain synthesis also declines as maturation in erythroid progenitors progresses. Understanding the developmental changes of gene expression at the beta globin locus is not purely of academic interest, since a therapeutic induction of HbF or HbA 2 (\u03b12\u03b42) production would be of significant clinical benefit for patients with a defect of HbA (\u03b12\u03b22) function or abundance, such as sickle cell disease or \u03b2 thalassemia. We have previously studied the genetic regulation of fetal hemoglobin persistence in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in healthy volunteers, and are now extending this approach to the study of HbA 2 . Our study population is the 'Twins UK' twin registry of healthy Europeans, mostly female adult individuals, with genome-wide single polymorphisms (SNP) data and hemoglobin phenotypes for a primary study group (n=2,340) and a second replication group (n=1,880). A quantitative trait GWAS analysis was carried out to assess the relationship between SNPs and the HbA 2 trait. We found that HbA 2 (as a percentage of total hemoglobin) was weakly, but significantly, correlated with the amount of fetal hemoglobin carrying cells (F cells) an individual possesses (r = 0.14, p < 0.01). This suggests the existence of some common biological process that influences both hemoglobin species. We also found that the same SNP alleles at chromosome 6q23.3 ( HBS1L-MYB , peak signal rs7775698, p = 2.51\u00d710 \u22129 ) that are associated with a boost in the prevalence of F cells and larger red blood cells (denoted by the mean cell volume or MCV) also promote HbA 2 levels, again pointing to some common biological factor connected with the erythropoietic maturation process. Interestingly, neither of the other two major HbF loci, BCL11A on chromosome 2p, or the HbF-promoting regions within the HBB cluster (at the \u03b2 LCR and the \u03b3 globin genes) on chromosome 11p, showed association with HbA 2 levels. Instead, SNPs around the \u03b2 globin gene itself (clearly separate also from the delta gene) exert a significant influence on HbA 2 levels (peak association rs12793110, p=5.11\u00d710 \u221212 ) (see Figure 1 ). In contrast to the HBS1L-MYB region on chromosome 6, the HbA 2 -boosting alleles at these SNPs do not increase red blood cell MCV. We propose that the SNPs around HBB influences HbA 2 (ie. \u03b4 globin gene) expression via a mechanism that is related to the competitive process between the \u03b2 and \u03b4 gene expression that might mimic a very mild \u03b2 thalassemic effect.

We propose that the systematic genetic study of specialized hematological traits in healthy volunteers can help to understand the biology of hematopoiesis.
