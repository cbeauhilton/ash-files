    "abstract_text": "The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a gemcitabine-based regimen in pretreated Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (HL) patients. Relapsed or refractory HL patients treated with gemcitabine, used alone or in combination with other cytotoxic agents, were retrospectively reviewed. Fifty-five patients were included in the study. Initial characteristics before gemcitabine administration were: Ann Arbor stage III\u2013IV: 84%; International Prognostic Score less than 3 in 20/43 cases (47%); thirty-one primary refractory patients at the end of first-line therapy (56%); median number of previous chemotherapy regimens of 3. Twenty-nine patients received gemcitabine alone with a median starting dose of 750 mg/m 2 per injection (range: 180\u20131250 mg/m 2 ); Gemcitabine was administered at a starting dose of 1000 mg/m 2 per injection (range: 500\u20131250) in combination with vinorelbine in 10 patients, oxaliplatin in 13 patients, and other drugs in 3 patients, with a median of 6 injections (range: 1\u201318). Overall response rate was 20% with 11% of complete remission. On univariate analysis, two adverse factors at progression were significant for response to gemcitabine-based regimen: stage III\u2013IV disease and hemoglobin level less than 10.5 g/dl. In conclusion, the two identified prognostic factors for response to gemcitabine are part of the International Prognostic Score of HL, suggesting that response to gemcitabine is mainly influenced by the specific prognostic factors of HL. Moreover, with an ORR of 29%, our results of the gemcitabine administered alone regimen are not different from those reported in the literature. In contrast, the results of the various series of HL patients treated by gemcitabine-combined regimens, mainly with cisplatin or derivatives, vinorelbine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone, are very different due to different patient characteristics. In heavily pretreated cases, as in our study, the ORR was 26%; inversely, in patients who had received only one or two lines of chemotherapy, the ORR varied between 64% and 82% with 9% to 54% of complete remissions. This discordance can probably be explained by the prognostic impact of previous treatment lines in the response to gemcitabine. This observation emphasizes the possible interest of using gemcitabine earlier in the treatment of Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, namely at the time of first relapse or after first-line treatment in primary refractory HL patients.",
