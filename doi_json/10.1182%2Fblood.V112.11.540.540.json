    "abstract_text": "Hemoglobin (Hb) E (\u03b226 Glu\u2192Lys), known to be more unstable than HbA in vitro, remains an enigma in terms of its contributions to red blood cell (RBC) pathophysiological mechanisms. EE individuals exhibit a mild, chronic anemia while HbE-\u03b2 thalassemia individuals show a range of clinical manifestations, including high morbidity and death, often resulting from cardiac disease. To determine pathophysiological consequences originating from HbE, we created a transgenic mouse expressing exclusively human HbE with equivalent \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains [Chen et al., Blood 106(11):892a, 2005]. This mice model exhibited hematological characteristics similar to human EE individuals: microcytic RBC with low MCV, low MCH but normal MCHC; target RBC; mild anemia with low Hb, low HCT, elevated reticulocytes; and decreased osmotic fragility. These RBC parameters correlated with indications of mild RBC oxidative stress. Importantly, the transgenic mouse model allows us to obtain purified HbE for crystal growth and dynamic studies, without the presence of human HbA 2 (co-expressed in human HbE RBC and difficult to separate). We now present the low [PDB 1YVQ ] and high salt [PDB 1YVT ] liganded COHbE structures (1.8A\u030a resolution) at or near physiological pH. The known in vitro instability of oxy HbE and its propensity for oxidation may be explained by the substitution of the \u03b226 side-chain with Lys resulting in a positive charge repulsion with consequential changes to \u03b2117, and other key stabilizing residues at the \u03b11\u03b21 interface that impart normal association and oxidative stability to HbA. The specific alterations observed in this microenvironment may be the key to HbE instability, given the findings by Adachi et al. ( Biochemistry , 42 : 10252 , 2003 ) that \u03b2116 in normal HbA plays a critical role in stabilizing \u03b11\u03b21 interactions and inhibiting oxidation. Additionally, the difference in water structure observed in each of our COHbE structures from crystals generated under different conditions clearly suggests that resolved water structure is dependent simply upon crystallization conditions, and caution must be taken in interpretation of thermal instability. The 1.6 A\u030a structure of deoxy HbE [PDB 3DUT ] (crystallization conditions: pH 6.8, 1.8M ammonium phosphate/ammonium sulfate/citrate) exhibits definitive quaternary change compared to the deoxy HbA structure obtained under similar conditions. These structural findings, explain in part, our recent spectroscopic findings of alterations in oxy and deoxy HbE-nitrite interactions.",
