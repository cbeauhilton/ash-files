    "abstract_text": "In normal myelopoiesis, immature myeloid cells (IMCs) differentiate into macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. However, in pathological conditions such as in cancer, these immature cells differentiate into myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBP-\u03b2) plays a crucial role in the accumulation of MDSCs in several pathological conditions. Of note, mice lacking C/EBP-\u03b2 in the bone marrow compartment lose the ability to differentiate IMCs into pathologically active MDSCs 2 .In contrast, up-regulation of C/EBP-\u03b2 can partly induce MDSC expansion through a mechanism involving the STAT3 pathway 3 . Epigenetic changes, such as histone acetylation status, have been recently shown to modulate the regulatory function of MDSCs 4 . However, the epigenetic mechanism(s) involved in regulation of C/EBP-\u03b2 gene expression in MDSCs are poorly understood. Here we show for the first time that among all the HDACs known, HDAC11, the newest member of this family of enzymes, is recruited to the C/EBP-\u03b2 gene promoter region of primary myeloid cells isolated from C57BL/6 mice. Such a finding led us to explore the functional consequences of disrupting HDAC11 in myeloid cells. First, we observed a markedly higher expression of C/EBP-\u03b2 mRNA (194 fold difference) in the CD11b + /Ly6G + granulocytic compartment and a 6.7 fold difference in the CD11b + /Ly6C + monocytic compartments of HDAC11KO mice relative to control wild type mice. Second, MDSCs from HDAC11 KO mice display a higher suppressive phenotype and mechanistically we have found that they have increased expression of the immunosuppressive STAT3/IL10 axis. Third, inoculation of EL4 tumor cells into HDAC11KO mice and controls resulted in a higher expansion capacity of splenic MDSCs in mice devoid of HDAC11. Such an effect was associated with a more rapid tumor growth in HDAC11KO mice as compared to WT mice. Similar aggressive tumor growth was also observed in HDAC11 myeloid conditional KO mice (LyZ-Cre-HDAC11KO). Taken together, we have uncovered a previously unknown role for HDAC11 as a transcriptional regulator of C/EBP-\u03b2 in MDSCs. Indeed, in the absence of this epigenetic checkpoint of C/EBP-\u03b2 gene expression, the fully suppressive potential of MDSCs was fully unleashed. A better understanding of this novel role of HDAC11 in myeloid biology will ultimately lead to targeted epigenetic therapies to manipulate the suppressive abilities of these immunoregulatory cells. 1.
