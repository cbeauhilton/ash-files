    "abstract_text": "Clinical outcome in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) is correlated with expression of inhibitors of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, including XIAP. XIAP suppresses apoptosis through inhibiting active caspases-3, -7 and -9. In this study we investigated if the small-molecule XIAP antagonist 1396\u201312 induces cell death in cultured lymphoma cells of DLBCL patients and whether it is possible to predict whether a DLBCL will be sensitive to the XIAP antagonist. Treatment with this XIAP antagonist resulted in induction of apoptosis in 16 of 20 tested DLBCL samples. Sensitivity to the XIAP antagonist was observed in both chemotherapy refractory and responsive DLBCL, but did not affect peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tonsil germinal center B-cells from healthy donors. XIAP antagonist-sensitive cases were characterized by high expression levels of XIAP and relatively low expression levels of Bcl-2. In addition, we found that XIAP antagonist sensitive lymphomas are characterized by constitutive caspase-9 activation and that the apoptosis inducing effect of the XIAP antagonist depends on this constitutive caspase 9 activity. These data indicate that the small-molecule XIAP antagonist can induce apoptosis in DLBCL cells by restoring caspase 9 mediated apoptosis and therefore should be considered for possible development as a therapy for these patients. In vitro sensitivity to the XIAP antagonist can be predicted based on biological markers suggesting the possibility of pre-defining patients most likely to benefit from XIAP antagonist therapy.",
