    "abstract_text": "Introduction Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) express CD123/IL-3R\u03b1 and promote tumor growth and immunosuppression in multiple myeloma (MM) ( Chauhan et al, Cancer Cell 2009, 16:309-323;  Ray et al, Leukemia, 2018,  32:843-846 ). Tagraxofusp is a novel targeted therapy directed against CD123, and is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm [BPDCN]). Tagraxofusp can also trigger anti-MM activity by reducing the viability of immunologically defective and tumor-promoting pDCs in MM. Furthermore, tagraxofusp synergistically enhances the anti-MM activity of anti-MM agents bortezomib and pomalidomide. Our preclinical findings led to a recently completed phase 1/2 clinical trial of tagraxofusp with pomalidomide/dexamethasone in relapsed/refractory MM patients (NCT02661022). Results demonstrated preliminary safety and efficacy, with 5 of 9 heavily pretreated patients achieving durable partial response (PR) ( ASH 2019 ). Here, we report the early results of our translational correlative studies using bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB), and serum from the study cohort. Methods Tagraxofusp is a bioengineered targeted therapy directed to CD123 comprised of human IL-3 fused to a truncated diphtheria toxin (DT) payload ( Stemline Therapeutics, NY ). pDCs and patient MM cells were purified from BM/PB samples after informed consent, and quantified using FACS, as described ( Ray et al, Leukemia, 2018). A novel high throughput seroproteomics platform SOMAscan was used to analyze 1,310 protein analytes in serum samples from MM patients (n = 9). SOMAscan data were subjected to meta-analysis to generate heatmaps, followed by hierarchical cluster analysis. SOMAscan results were validated with ELISA using supernatants from MM patient pDCs cultured with or without tagraxofusp. Results Analysis of BM/PB samples from MM patients receiving tagraxofusp therapy showed a distinct reduction in the frequency of viable pDCs [average 2% at screening vs 0.75% post-tagraxofusp; n = 6; p = 0.036]. Of note, pDCs isolated from tagraxofusp-treated patients showed decreased ability to trigger MM cell growth. SOMAscan analysis of patient serum before and after tagraxofusp therapy showed alterations in the levels of 100 proteins [Median Fold Change in expression: 0.39 to 4.5; n = 6; 3 each; p < 0.05]. Importantly, tagraxofusp treatment reduced pDC-related soluble proteins including IFN-\u03b1 (fold change: 0.8, treated vs untreated; p < 0.05). Pathway analysis further show that treatment affected immune signaling. For example, tagraxofusp decreased the levels of immunosuppressive proteins, soluble CD40L and IL1R2 (0.071-fold and 0.088 fold vs untreated; p = 0.02 and p = 0.013, respectively), promoting immune response. Moreover, analysis of end of treatment samples showed decreased soluble C-reactive protein, affecting the complement cascade after treatment (0.53-fold, p = 0.0173) via the downregulation of several C-C motif soluble chemokines (p < 0.05). Our earlier study showed that pDC-MM interactions triggered secretion of IL-3, which in turn promotes both pDC survival and MM cell growth. Importantly, tagraxofusp in this trial decreased serum IL-3 levels (fold change 0.75, treated vs untreated; p < 0.05). Conclusions In the present study, we validate the target specificity of tagraxofusp against MM pDCs in relapsed and refractory MM patients enrolled in a phase 1/2 clinical trial. A future clinical trial of tagraxofusp in combination with bortezomib and pomalidomide will examine the utility of tagraxofusp to improve outcome in patients with relapsed refractory MM.
