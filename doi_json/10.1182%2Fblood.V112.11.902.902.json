    "abstract_text": "The outcome of adolescents (\u2265 15 years old) with ALL treated on contemporary pediatric ALL protocols has improved and compares favorably with the results of adolescents treated on adult protocols. However, the overall outcome of adolescents is still inferior to that of young children. In order to analyze this difference we compared early response to treatment and biological characteristics of various ALL subtypes (T-cell and non-T-cell), in these age groups. Between January 1989 and June 2008, a total of 942 patients, i.e.,83 (9%) aged \u2265 15 years, 162 (17%) aged 1050 chromosomes), higher incidence of Philadelphia chromosome, and normal karyotype compared to younger patients (1<10 y) (p=0.0064). In conclusion: In adolescents the higher incidence of unfavorable biological features in B-lineage ALL could contribute to their inferior results compared to young children. In T-cell ALL, no difference was demonstrated either in the outcome or biological characteristics, among the age groups of patients receiving the ALL-INS treatment (BFM backbone).
