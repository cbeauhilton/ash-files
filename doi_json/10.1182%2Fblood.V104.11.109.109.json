    "abstract_text": "Tumor antigen-specific T-cell tolerance imposes a significant barrier to the development of effective therapeutic cancer vaccines. Bone marrow-derived antigen presenting cells (APCs) are critical in the induction of this unresponsive state. Recently, we have identified STAT3 signaling in APCs as an important regulatory pathway that determines the functional outcome of antigen-specific CD4 + T-cells in response to cognate antigen. Indeed, while disruption of this signaling pathway in APCs led to effective T cell priming, enhanced STAT3 activity resulted in the induction of T cell unresponsiveness 1 . Given the above results, we explored in this study whether disruption of STAT3 signaling in APCs may preserve the responsiveness of antigen-specific CD4 + T-cells during the growth of a tumor that induces antigen specific T-cell tolerance. First, mice with a genetic disruption of Stat3 in macrophages, neutrophils and a sub-population of myeloid DCs (LysMcre/Stat3 flox/\u2212 mice) or control C57BL/6 mice were given subcutaneously 1x10 6 B16 melanoma tumor cells engineered to express Ovalbumin as a model tumor antigen (B16-OVA). Four days later, naive CD4 + T-cells (1x10 6 ) specific for a MHC class II-restricted epitope of Ovalbumin (OT-II cells) were adoptively transferred intravenously into tumor bearing mice as well as into tumor-free controls. Two weeks later animals were sacrificed and antigen-specific CD4 + T-cell responses to in vitro re-stimulation with OVA-peptide were evaluated. As expected, antigen-specific T cells re-isolated from tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice were fully tolerant (lack of HA-specific proliferation and cytokine production). In sharp contrast, anti-OVA CD4 + T-cells isolated from tumor bearing LysMcre/Stat3 flox/\u2212 mice remained fully functional as determined by their capacity to proliferate and produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma in response to cognate OVA-peptide. The demonstration that tumor-induced antigen-specific CD4 + T-cell tolerance occurs in mice with an intact STAT3 signaling in APCs, but not in mice with genetic disruption of this signaling pathway, led us next to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacologic inhibitors of STAT3 in preventing and or overcoming tumor-induced T-cell tolerance. In vivo treatment of tumor bearing mice with Tyrphostin AG490 (0.5 mg/ i.p. /twice a day x 5 days), a well-known inhibitor of STAT3 signaling, also resulted in preservation of the responsiveness of tumor-antigen specific CD4 + T-cells. Furthermore, in vitro treatment of APCs with this compound led to effective priming of naive antigen-specific T cells and breaking of antigen-specific T-cell anergy. More recently, we have evaluated the efficacy of a novel STAT3 inhibitor, compound 295558, which efficiently inhibits the DNA-binding activity of STAT3. Treatment of DCs or macrophages with this specific inhibitor led to the generation of inflammatory APCs capable of restoring the responsiveness of tolerized CD4 + T-cells isolated from tumor bearing mice. Taken together, our findings establish a critical role for STAT3 signaling in the induction of tolerance to tumor antigens in vivo . Inhibition of this signaling pathway in APCs provides a novel molecular target to overcome the remarkable barrier that tolerance to tumor antigens imposes to cancer vaccination strategies.",
