Material and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed blood bank records of all SCD patients transfused pRBCs since 1990. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi square test and Fischer\u2019s exact test. Results: During 1990\u20132004, 500 SCD patients received pRBCs in our medical center. Of these, 387 received pRBC units crossmatched only for ABO and Rh blood types and suffered 37 transfusion reactions. Table I: General data of various patient groups  Major patient groups .

The technologist required 30 more minutes and $153 extra in reagent costs for this extended CEK match. Most Rh negative pRBC units were also CEKneg. 90% of our donors are Caucasian. Discussion: \u2019Non-alloAB forming\u2019 patients who received ABORh matched transfusions were 4 times less likely (and twice less likely when number of transfusions was considered) to develop allergic transfusion reaction (p=0.002), compared with \u2019alloAB forming\u2019 counterparts. Similar finding is seen in patients receiving CEK matched pRBCs. It would be interesting to know if \u2019slow/rapid/non alloAB producer patients had any genetic predisposition accounting for early/slow/non-development of ABs and transfusion reactions or if alloAB formation transforms the immune system to a hyper-reactive state leading to autoAB formation/allergic reaction. Conclusions: This study showed that utilizing extended antigen (C, E, K) matching for pRBC transfusion \u2193\u2193 alloAB(p<0.01) and autoAB(p=0.005) formation in our SCD patients and eliminated transfusion reactions. Universal availability of leukopoor pRBCs may have eliminated febrile reactions. AlloAB forming patients were more prone to develop allergic transfusion reaction (p=0.002). AutoAB formation was more common in patients with alloABs and did not cause complications. dHTRs were rare and mild. CEK matching made it easier to find and transfuse blood due to less formation of ABs and reactions. However, it resulted in marked overuse of Rh negative pRBCs, extra cost and additional effort to find CEKneg pRBCs for every transfusion."
