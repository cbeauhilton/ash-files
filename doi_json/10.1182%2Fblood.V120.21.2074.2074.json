Bisphosphonates - pamidronate, sodium clodronate and zoledronic acid - have revolutionised the treatment of myeloma bone disease and form a significant part of the myeloma treatment pathway. It is therefore important to understand patient perspectives of and preferences for this important treatment. Aims: To understand the information patients receive from clinicians and the impact this has on their understanding of bisphosphonates, to establish what patient preferences are for how and where they receive bisphosphonates and to determine whether patients are satisfied with the level of decision-making input they have about their bisphosphonate treatment. Results: Patients were asked to complete a 36 question survey, devised by Myeloma UK, which was available in paper copy and online. 606 patients responded to the survey of which 95.3% had received bisphosphonates. When asked about the information they were given by their clinicians when prescribed bisphosphonates, 81.7% received a verbal explanation, 23.7% received written information and 2.7% received details of a website/helpline. 30.6% used a product leaflet and 30.1% sourced a patient organisation information sheet. 80% of patients thought the information was \u2018easy to understand\u2019. When asked why they had been prescribed bisphosphonates, patients accurately reported that it was \u2018to strengthen the bones\u2019 (82.5%), \u2018to delay the progression of myeloma\u2019 (28.7%) and \u2018to prevent/reduce high levels of calcium in the blood\u2019 (15.7%). 16.6% of patients wrongly thought that bisphosphonates were prescribed \u2018to heal the bones\u2019 and 5.8% had no understanding of bisphosphonates. 51.7% of patients received their current or last bisphosphonates \u2018by monthly infusion in hospital\u2019 and 39.1% \u2018by tablet form at home\u2019. 9.2% stated \u2018other\u2019 referring to more flexible methods of prescribing. When asked how they would prefer to receive their bisphosphonates, 46.5% selected \u2018by regular visits for infusion in hospital\u2019 and 41.1% \u2018by daily tablets taken at home\u2019. Patients who preferred to receive bisphosphonates \u2018by regular visits for infusion in hospital\u2019 reported this was due to \u2018confidence in quality of care in hospital\u2019 (80.7%), \u2018there is medical support on hand\u2019 (54.4%), \u2018it keeps a check on my myeloma\u2019 (64.9%), \u2018I prefer monthly rather than daily treatment\u2019 (52.1%) and \u2018 I can get my blood tests done at the same time' (59.1%). Patients who preferred to receive bisphosphonates by \u2018daily tablets taken at home\u2019 , reported this was due to \u2018convenience\u2019 (93.3%), \u2018ease\u2019 (71.4%), \u2018 it reduces hospital visits' (61.6%) and allows them to \u2018avoid infusions\u2019 (37.9%). On a scale of (1) no input and (5) full input, patients gave the level of decision-making input they had over how and where to receive bisphosphonates an average rating of 2.1 \u2013 64.6% rated (1), 6.2% rated (2), 4.9% rated (3), 2.8% rated (4), 21.5% rated (5). When asked if they were satisfied with this level of input, 79.5% of patients were satisfied, 20.3% would have preferred more input and 0.2% less. Conclusions: Patients who received information about bisphosphonates were generally satisfied it was good quality and helped them understand why they were prescribed bisphosphonates. A significant proportion of patients did not receive a verbal explanation and/or did not receive written information from a clinician or source information themselves, which explains the high percentage of patients who did not understand why they had been prescribed bisphosphonates. Patients have different and individual preferences for how and where they want to receive bisphosphonates. Patients were polarised between their preferences for receiving their bisphosphonates intravenously or by tablet form and when responses were cross-referenced, their preferences were approximately correlated with their most recent bisphosphonate. The survey also shows approximately 1 in 5 patients would have preferred more decision-making input on their choice of bisphosphonate treatment. In the UK, there is variation in uptake of oral and intravenous bisphosphonates despite evidence showing improved efficacy of intravenous zoledronic acid over oral sodium clodronate. Further investigation is warranted to determine the link between patient's preferences and uptake of different bisphosphonates. Disclosures: Low: Novartis UK Limited: Research Funding.
