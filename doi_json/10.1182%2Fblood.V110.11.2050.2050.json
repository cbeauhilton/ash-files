    "abstract_text": "Background: CLL is still an incurable lymphoid malignancy. The current standard of care is to treat only patients with obvious clinical progression as defined by the National Cancer Institute Working Group in 1996 (NCI\u2013WG 1996). High risk CLL can be identified at diagnosis by a variety of tests including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IgV H ) analysis, and expression of ZAP-70 or CD38. With this information we can identify patients with high risk, early stage disease who are candidates for novel low toxicity therapies that could alter the natural course of their disease. Our hypothesis was that combination monoclonal antibody (MoAb) therapy using alemtuzumab and rituximab would significantly reduce the high risk clone in early stage CLL. Methods: This phase II trial was conducted with IRB approval and accrued the planned 30 patients between January 2005 and July 2007 at Mayo Clinic Rochester. The study enrolled consenting patients with Rai stage 0\u2013II CLL without NCI\u2013WG 1996 criteria for treatment who had high risk CLL as defined as one or more of the following 17p13\u2013, 11q22\u2013, unmutated (UM) IgV H (< 2%) and expression of ZAP\u201370 (\u2265 30%) and/or CD38 (\u226520%). Treatment was one 30 day cycle (alemtuzumab 3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg days 1\u20133 then 30 mg 3 \u00d7 week \u00d7 4 weeks with all doses subcutaneously and rituximab at 375 mg/m 2 /week IV \u00d7 4 doses from day 8). Patients received 7 days of allopurinol and antimicrobial prophylaxis against PCP and herpes virus infections for 7 months. CMV testing by PCR was done weekly during treatment, then monthly \u00d7 6. Results: All 30 patients have completed therapy and 27 have been evaluated for response. The median age of these 27 patients was 62 yr (range 29\u201377) with 8 patients > 70 years. There was a male predominance (67%) with median time from diagnosis to treatment of 0.7 yr (range 0.1 \u2013 6.1). Stage (Rai) at the start of therapy was 0 in 7 (26%), I in 19 (70%), and II in 1. High risk markers were 17p13\u2013 in 9 (33%), 11q22\u2013 in 7 (26%), UM IgV and expression of either ZAP\u201370 or CD38 in 11 (41%). All 27 patients completed therapy without interruption. Non hematological grade 3\u20134 toxicity occurred in 3 patients (2 drug reactions caused by SMX/TMP, 1 CMV reactivation responsive to IV therapy). Response evaluation at 2 months after completion of therapy using NCI\u2013WG 1996 criteria showed an ORR of 93% with 12 (44%) CR, 8 (30%) nPR, and 5 (19%) PR. Two (7%) patients had disease progression. Median duration of follow up was 14.1 months (range 1.9 \u2013 27.2). Median time to disease progression in the 25 responding patients was 14.4 months (95% CI 5.9 \u2013 22.4). Seven (26%) patients have received subsequent treatment for CLL (median 5.2 months, range 2.4 \u2013 20.1). A minimal residual disease assay using 3-color flow cytometry on peripheral blood was negative in 6 of the 7 patients with CR who had no evidence of residual CLL on immunohistochemical examination of the bone marrow. These 6 patients all remain in sustained CR (median follow up 15 months, range 2 \u2013 27.2). Conclusion: Alemtuzumab and rituximab is an effective and tolerable therapy in patients with high risk early stage CLL. A randomized controlled trial is now required to test if this intervention is better than the standard observation approach. In addition, this combination MoAb regimen could be used as a platform to develop even more effective combination treatments for patients with CLL.",
