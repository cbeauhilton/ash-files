    "abstract_text": "Background: Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a promising cancer immunotherapy that is growing exponentially. The doubling time of medical knowledge in 2010 was 3.5 years, and the projection for 2020 is just 73 days. In the last five years, the number of PubMed publications on cancer applications of CAR T cells has tripled. Therefore, to remain updated in the field represents a challenge for patients, care providers and researchers. In this review we provide a focused summary of the currently ongoing clinical trials, with a comprehensive overview of advances in CAR T cell therapy, beyond CD19, emphasizing on antigenic targets, development phases, and leading sponsor pharmaceutical companies. Methods: We retrieved the available data from the national registry of clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov) using the following keywords: \"CAR T cell\", \"CAR T cell and cancer\", \"chimeric antigen receptor\", \"CAR T AND tumor antigen\", 'CAR T cell antigens\", \"Tumor antigens targeted by CAR T cells\", \"engineered T cells\", \"modified T cell\", \"CAR T cells in Cancer\", \"CAR T cell therapy\", \"CAR T cell therapy AND Cancer\" until December 31, 2018 and manually excluded the trials unrelated to CAR T-cell therapies on cancer, by reviewing the detailed information provided on the website as well as preliminary data published. Results: The analysis included 271 clinical trials posted on the clinicaltrials.gov website from the United States by the cut-off date. For efficacy analysis, we retrieved information from 52 trials, by NCT number on a PubMed search. The majority of CAR T clinical research is focused on hematological cancer (57%), followed by CNS 8%, GI 6%, Skin 5%, Genitourinary 4%, Breast 4%, Gynecologic 4%, Respiratory 3%, Sarcoma 2%, Mesothelioma 2% and others 5%. The most used target in CAR T cell therapy and the leaders in phase 3 trials are CD19 (42%) and BCMA (12%), followed by CD20, NY-ESO-1, Mesothelin, HER2, GD2, MAGE-A3 and CD30. An essential step in CAR T cell therapy development is the selection of the right antigen/target. Here, we provide an overview of the clinically relevant targets that are actively being using by clinical trials in the United States. For example, CD19 appears to be a leading target regarding CAR T cell therapy on cancer with 116 trials (42% of total CAR T cells trials) on going just in the United States with a significant increment in the previous years. Similarly, with BCMA is one of the targets with more phase 3 trials ( Figure 1 ) with promising results on patients with Multiple Myeloma with and the objective response of 85%, CR 45%, and PFS of 11.8 months. Second-generation CARs with either CD28 or 4-1BB as costimulatory signaling domain are preferred, with 4-1BB being the most commonly chosen. Conclusions: Our findings show growing trends in the development of CAR T cell-based therapies, combination and possible retargeting therapies in the future for solid tumor and hematologic malignances; taking into account the amount of important information and the complexity of the database, we have developed this analysis to understand how to generate in the future a friendly platform for researchers and patients to have an detailed overview of the clinical trials in cellular therapies View large Download slide View large Download slide  Close modal Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
