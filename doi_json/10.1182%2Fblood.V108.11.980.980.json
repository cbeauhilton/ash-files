    "abstract_text": "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal hematological disorder affecting all hematopoietic lineages, which lack glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane proteins due to somatic mutations in the phosphatidylinositol glycan-class A gene, and is one disorder of bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes. Autoreactive T lymphocytes are implicated in some of the immune mechanisms involved in PNH. In fact, we reported recently that the HLA-DRB1 * 1501 allele and HLA-A * 0206 allele is frequent and is related to grading of hemolysis, respectively, in PNH patients (Shichishima T et al, Blood, 2002 and Haematologica, 2006, respectively). However, some characteristics of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes, including GPI-negative CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes, in PNH patients remain unknown. To know some characteristics of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes with and without expressions of GPI proteins in PNH, we examined preferential variable beta chain (V\u03b2) repertoires of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and expressions of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) by flow cytometry and the TCR V\u03b2 complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) spectratypes by genetic methods at the same time in CD4 + CD59 + , CD4 + CD59 \u2212 , CD8 + CD59 + , and/or CD8 + CD59 \u2212 T lymphocytes from 10 Japanese patients, including 6 and 4 with the HLA-DRB1 * 1501 allele and HLA-A * 0206 allele, respectively, and from 5 age-matched healthy individuals. In the analyses of TCR V\u03b2 repertoires, over-expressed TCR V\u03b2 subfamilies were found in any T lymphocytes subsets from all the patients. We found significantly higher numbers (mean \u00b1 standard deviation; 1.9 \u00b1 1.2) of over-expressed TCR V\u03b2 subfamilies in CD8 + CD59 + T lymphocytes from PNH patients compared with those (0 \u00b1 0, p <0.01) from healthy individuals. In the TCR V\u03b2 CDR3 spectratyping, skewed TCR V\u03b2 CDR3 spectatypes were found in more than one TCR V\u03b2 subfamilies of CD3 + CD4 + CD59 \u2212 , CD3 + CD8 + CD59 + , and CD3 + CD8 + CD59 \u2212 T lymphocytes from all the PNH patients. The numbers of skewed TCR V\u03b2 CDR3 spectatypes in CD3 + CD8 + CD59 + (4.0 \u00b1 3.3) and CD3 + CD8 + CD59 \u2212 (7.5 \u00b1 3.9) T lymphocytes from one PNH patient were significantly greater than those in CD3 + CD4 + CD59 + T lymphocytes (0.6 \u00b1 1.0, p <0.005) and CD3 + CD4 + CD59 \u2212 (2.5 \u00b1 1.5, p <0.002), respectively. Skewed TCR V\u03b2 CDR3 spectatypes were found commonly in V\u03b2 25 subfamily of CD3 + CD8 + CD59 + and CD3 + CD8 + CD59 \u2212 T lymphocytes from all of 4 PNH patients with the HLA-A * 0206 allele. In the analyses of IFN-\u03b3 expressions, more than one TCR V\u03b2 subfamiliy with over-expression of IFN-\u03b3 was found in CD8 + CD59 + and/or CD8 + CD59 \u2212 T lymphocytes from 9 patients and in CD4 + CD59 + and/or CD4 + CD59 \u2212 T lymphocytes from 8 patients. The numbers of TCR V\u03b2 subfamiliy with over-expression of IFN-\u03b3 in CD8 + CD59 + T lymphocytes (5.2 \u00b1 4.3), but not in the other T lymphocyte subsets, from one PNH patient were significantly greater than those from healthy individuals (0 \u00b1 0, p <0.05). However, there were no specific V\u03b2 subfamilies determined by any analyses, described above, in PNH. In conclusion, we found high frequencies of increased IFN-\u03b3-producing and/or skewed CD8 + T lymphocyte subfamilies with and/or without CD59 expression in PNH patients, suggesting that these cells may contribute to the occurrence of BMF rather than negative selection of PNH clones through action of IFN-\u03b3 in PNH.",
