    "abstract_text": "Asparaginase is an antileukemic enzyme that depletes the nonessential amino acid asparagine, but resistance is a common clinical problem whose biologic basis is poorly understood. We recently found that Wnt-induced inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) profoundly sensitizes drug-resistant leukemias to asparaginase (Hinze et al, Cancer Cell, 2019;35:664). This effect is mediated by a \u03b2-catenin independent branch of Wnt signaling termed Wnt-dependent stabilization of proteins (Wnt/STOP), which inhibits GSK3-dependent protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Acebron et al, Mol Cell, 2014;54:663). Thus, asparaginase-resistant leukemias rely on catabolic protein degradation as an alternative source of amino acids to survive asparaginase therapy. Asparaginase resistance is selectively mediated by GSK3\u03b1, because its genetic or pharmacologic inhibition fully phenocopied Wnt-induced sensitization to asparaginase (p < 0.0001), whereas selective inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 had no effect. This is surprising because GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 are closely related paralogs thought to be redundant for many of their biologic functions. Thus, our objective was to define why asparaginase resistance is selectively dependent on GSK3\u03b1 activity. To define the GSK3 domains responsible for asparaginase resistance, we leveraged the fact that selective depletion of GSK3\u03b1 induces profound sensitization to asparaginase, and this effect is rescued by expression of a cDNA encoding GSK3\u03b1, but not GSK3\u03b2. We thus tested whether asparaginase resistance could be restored by expression of a series of GSK3 alleles in which the N-terminal, kinase, and C-terminal domains of GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 were swapped in various configurations. This revealed that asparaginase resistance is dependent on the N-terminal domain of GSK3\u03b1, whereas the kinase and the C-terminal domain were interchangeable. Fusing the N-terminus of GSK3\u03b1 to the kinase and C-terminal domains of GSK3\u03b2 fully restored asparaginase resistance in GSK3\u03b1 depleted T-ALL (p < 0.0001) and AML cells (p < 0.0001). By contrast, fusing the N-terminus of GSK3\u03b2 to the kinase and C-terminus of GSK3\u03b1 had no discernible effect on response to asparaginase (p = n.s.). To investigate how the N-terminus of GSK3\u03b1 regulates asparaginase response, we first applied structural prediction algorithms. This revealed that the N-terminal domain of GSK3\u03b1 is a low-complexity (or prion-like) domain predicted to be intrinsically disordered, features associated with liquid-liquid phase separation. Phase separation is an increasingly recognized feature of cell biology that allows cells to concentrate components of important biochemical reactions in so-called membraneless organelles, thus promoting high-catalytic efficiency. Indeed, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy revealed that GSK3\u03b1, but not GSK3\u03b2, translocates into cytoplasmic bodies in response to asparagine depletion (p < 0.0001). The cytoplasmic GSK3a bodies were membraneless, as assessed by a proteinase K protection assay, and appeared to be distinct from known phase-separated compartments such as stress granules, P-bodies and aggresomes. However, cytoplasmic GSK3\u03b1 bodies colocalized with the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), K48-linked ubiquitin and the proteasome, suggesting that these bodies function in protein unfolding, ubiquitination and degradation. Indeed, genetic depletion of either GSK3\u03b1 or HSP70 blocked formation of phase-separated GSK3\u03b1 bodies (p < 0.0001) and induced asparaginase sensitivity (p < 0.0001). To explore the clinical relevance of GSK3\u03b1 body formation in response to asparagine starvation, we tested a panel of matched asparaginase resistant vs. sensitive T-ALL, AML and B-ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and found that the ability of GSK3\u03b1 to undergo phase separation significantly correlated with resistance to asparaginase in T-ALL, B-ALL and AML (Figure 1, p < 0.0001). Our data support a model in which inducible phase separation of GSK3\u03b1 and heat shock proteins represents a previously unrecognized response to amino acid starvation that concentrates the cellular machinery for protein degradation, thus allowing efficient catalysis of this alternative source of amino acids in response to amino acid starvation.
