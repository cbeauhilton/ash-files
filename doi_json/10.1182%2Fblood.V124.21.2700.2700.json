    "abstract_text": "We describe a case of severe neonatal anemia with kernicterus due to compound heterozygosity for null mutations in KLF1 , each inherited from asymptomatic parents. One of the mutations is novel. This is the first described case of a KLF1 null human. The phenotype of severe DAT-negative non-spherocytic hemolytic anaemia (NSHA), jaundice, hepato-splenomegaly, and marked erythroblastosis is more severe than that present in CDA type IV due to dominant mutations in the second zinc-finger of KLF1. There was a very high level of HbF expression into childhood (>70%), consistent with a key role for KLF1 in human hemoglobin switching. We performed RNA-seq on circulating erythroblasts and found human KLF1 acts like mouse Klf1 to coordinate expression of >500 genes required to build a red cell including those encoding globins, cytoskeletal components, AHSP, heme synthesis enzymes, cell cycle regulators, and blood group antigens. We interrogated recently published KLF1 ChIP-seq to determine directly regulated KLF1 genes in man. We identify novel KLF1 target genes including KIF23 and KIF11 which are required for proper cytokinesis. KIF23 mutations result in CDA type III so our finding provides a direct link btween CDA IV adn CDA III. We also identify new roles for KLF1 in autophagy, global transcriptional control and RNA splicing. We suggest loss of KLF1 should be considered in otherwise unexplained cases of severe neonatal NSHA or hydrops fetalis . Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
