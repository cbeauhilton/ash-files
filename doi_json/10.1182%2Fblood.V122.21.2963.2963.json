    "abstract_text": "Background Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is an aggressive and heterogeneous subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). PTCL has a poor prognosis due to advanced stage at presentation, and generally poor response to standard chemotherapy. According to recent SEER estimates, PTCL accounts for about 4% of all NHL cases in the United States each year. To date, few studies have assessed the clinical and economic burden of PTCL. Methods MarketScan data for commercially insured and Medicare supplemental patients were used to retrospectively identify unique PTCL patients. Patients were identified by ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes between October 1, 2007 and June 30, 2011. The time of first PTCL diagnosis code served as the index date, and a second PTCL diagnosis date was used for confirmation. All patients were required to have at least 6 months of continuous enrollment before and 12 months of continuous enrollment after their index date. Patients were excluded if aged <18 years, date of birth or gender were missing, or if they had received a stem cell transplant (SCT) prior to PTCL diagnosis. The control group includes patients that may have any other malignant (excluding PTCL) or non-malignant condition and are considered to represent an average insured patient population from the payer perspective. The control group was matched based on age, sex, region, plan type, payer type, and length of enrollment. Mean cost per month was measured and annualized to provide average yearly costs. Healthcare costs included hospitalizations, pharmacy services, office visits, emergency room visits, hospice stays, SCT, and other patient-related costs (lab procedures, radiology procedures, blood transfusions, and other ancillary procedures). Results Of 2820 patients with \u22651 PTCL diagnosis, 1000 patients were identified that met all inclusion criteria (mean age 56 years, 58% male), and were matched to the control group. On an average annual basis, PTCL patients were hospitalized more often (0.9 vs 0.1 hospitalizations), and experienced a longer length of stay (6.4 vs 4 days) compared with matched controls. In addition, PTCL patients had a higher utilization of office visits (16.2 vs 4.1 visits), pharmacy services (34.2 vs 11.6 prescriptions), emergency room visits (0.8 vs 0.2 visits), and hospice care (0.6 vs 0.1 stays). PTCL patients also experienced higher comorbidities (mean Charlson Comorbidity Index of 1.72 vs 0.39, as determined at index date). Overall, PTCL patients incurred much higher average annual costs compared with matched patients ($75,934.08 vs $4660.64; Table), driven mainly by hospitalizations (32.2% of overall costs) and pharmacy services (19.6% of overall costs). Conclusions PTCL is associated with high resource utilization rates and high overall costs. The development of efficacious treatments for PTCL may offer better disease management and may reduce the clinical and economic burden of PTCL.
