    "abstract_text": "Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) remains a major complication in recipients of hematopoietic cell allografts and is associated with poor outcome. Salvage treatment is difficult after failure of steroids. OKT3 muromonab is a monoclonal murine IgG2a antibody directed against the CD3 antigen on T-lymphocytes that has proven effective in transplant settings both of solid organs and bone marrow. Here we report on the results of OKT3 treatment in 43 patients who had received stem-cell or bone marrow allografts for hematologic malignancies and subsequently been diagnosed with steroid-resistant aGvHD. Overall, 48 treatment cycles of OKT3 (5 mg intravenous injection once daily) were administered for acute GvHD of grades II (n = 12), III (n = 27) and IV (n = 9). Mean duration of OKT3 therapy was 9 (range, 1 \u201316) days. Twenty cycles of OKT3 were administered as second line and 28 as third-plus line (third line, n = 14; fourth line, n = 14) treatment regimens. Side effects were mild to moderate, comprising fever, dyspnea, tachycardia, and vomiting. Thirty of 42 evaluable patients responded to therapy for an overall response rate of 69 %. Complete remissions were seen in 6 (11.9 %) and partial remissions in 24 patients (57.1 %). Response to treatment was 88.8 % for skin GvHD; 53.3 % for gut aGvHD; and 8.7 % for liver involvement. Recurrent or progressive acute GvHD was observed in 23 patients (54.8 %) after a median of 9 (range, 1 \u2013 58) days. Pharmacokinetic studies of monoclonal antibody OKT3 were performed in 17 patients, 16 of whom achieved at least a partial remission. Treatment duration was > 5 days in 16 patients. Adequate plasma levels (> 1000 ng/ml) were observed in 13 patients after a median of 6 (1 \u2013 11) days on treatment. OKT3 concentration became undetectable at a median of merely 4 (3 \u2013 11) days after discontinuation of therapy. Survival at 100 days from transplantation was 58.1 % and at one year, 25.5 % with the most important causes of death being infectious complications (44.7%) and GvHD (33.2%). Patients treated with OKT3 earlier in the course of aGVHD showed a trend to better survival: 35% of patients with 2nd-line therapy were alive at one year from transplantation, compared to 17.4% with 3rd- plus line treatment (p=0.21). There was also a trend to a better one-year survival for patients with grade II (33% of patients alive) when compared to grade III/IV aGvHD (16% of patients alive; p=0.24). Thus, a significant proportion of patients with corticosteroid-resistant acute GvHD showed a response to salvage treatment with OKT3. More effective antimicrobial prophylaxis and treatment are mandatory to overcome considerable treatment-related mortality in those high-risk patients.",
