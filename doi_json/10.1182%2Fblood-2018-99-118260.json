    "abstract_text": "Background Cardiovascular diseases are linked with oxidative stress which is the source of reactive oxidative and nitrative species, contributors of post-translational modification. Fibrinogen due to its high concentration in blood is considered as one of the most sought of targets of oxidative stress substances. Post-translational modifications of fibrinogen might influence its physiological function, thus affect hemostasis in the terms of fibrin nets forming and architecture or interaction with platelets. The aim of this study was to observe influence of in vivo fibrinogen modifications on formation of fibrin net and to identify amino acid residues prone to changes related to oxidative stress. Methods Plasma samples were collected from patients of The Military University Hospital Prague in the agreement with ethical committees of participating institutions and with informed consents from all subjects. Samples were divided into 4 groups: patients with acute coronary syndrome (A), patients with stroke (B), patients with thrombus localized in carotid vein (C) and control group (patients without coronary atherosclerosis; D). Fibrin net architecture was studied by scanning electron microscopy (Mira 3 LMH, Tescan Orsay Holding, a.s., Brno, Czech Republic). For identification of modified amino acids residue mass spectroscopy was used (Triple TOF 6600, Sciex). Molecular dynamics simulations of hydrated protein were performed in Gromacs software with Gromos force fields. Crystal structure 3GHG was used as a reference structure to which post-translational modifications were introduced manually in Yasara View. Results We found extensive both qualitative and quantitative changes in the structure of fibrinogen molecule in all groups of patients. Oxidative stress level differed among patient groups and between the control group. Different oxidative changes caused by in vivo modifications of fibrinogen affected quite distinctly the architecture of fibrin net. Modified amino acids were detected in all three fibrinogen chains. In gamma chain the localisation of modified amino acid residues correlated with the part of fibrinogen important for fibrin polymerisation. The impact of the most pronounced post-translational modifications on the secondary structure of fibrinogen was described by molecular dynamics simulations. Conclusions The results show that the degree of impairment of fibrinogen functions in the cardiovascular diseases is related to the level of oxidative stress. Characterization of oxidative fibrinogen modification and its precise meaning to the function of fibrinogen in hemostasis appears to be extremely helpful to better understanding of thrombotic/bleeding complications linked with various cardiovascular diseases.
