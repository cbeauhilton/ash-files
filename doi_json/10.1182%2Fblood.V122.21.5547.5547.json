    "abstract_text": "Background Bortezomib and high-dose melphalan was associated with a higher complete remission (CR) rate in a phase II trial by the IFM group. Four doses of bortezomib 1 mg/m 2 IV were given on days -6, -3, +1 and +4. (Roussel M et al. Blood 2010. 115:32-37). In a randomized phase II trial we reported that the addition of bortezomib to a preparative regimen of arsenic trioxide (ATO), ascorbic acid (AA), and melphalan followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) failed to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in CR rate or survival in patients (pts) with newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma (Sharma M et al. Cancer. 118:2507-15). This study was limited by a short follow up (median 36 months) and inclusion of pts with relapsed and refractory disease. In this retrospective analysis, we evaluated the long-term (5-years) impact of the addition of bortezomib to this preparative regimen in pts who underwent auto-HCT in first remission or with primary refractory disease. Methods Forty-three pts underwent auto-HCT in first remission or with primary refractory disease. All patients received ATO 0.25 mg/kg intravenously on days -9 to -3, AA 1000 mg intravenously on days -9 to -3, and melphalan 100 mg/m2 intravenously on days -4 and -3. Pts received either no bortezomib (n=13), or bortezomib at a dose of either 1 mg/m 2 of 1.5 mg/m 2 on days -9, -6, and -3. The primary endpoint was CR rate and secondary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results Pt characteristics are shown in the attached Table. The median follow-up for all surviving pts was 61.4 months (range, 15-80 months). Pts in the bortezomib and non-bortezomib arms were matched for age, gender, high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, time to auto-HSCT, use of bortezomib in induction, and disease burden at auto-HSCT ( Table ). Only 5 (17%) pts in the bortezomib and 4 (30%) in the non-bortezomib group received maintenance therapy. There was no significant difference in the time to neutrophil engraftment or treatment-related mortality TRM between the bortezomib and non-bortezomib groups. The CR rate in the bortezomib group and the non-bortezomib group was 20% and 53%, respectively (p=0.03). There was no significant difference in rates of CR + very good partial remission (VGPR), or CR + VGPR + partial remission (PR) between the bortezomib and non-bortezomib groups (p=0.72 and 1.00, respectively). The median PFS in the bortezomib group and the non-bortezomib group was 25.4, and 40.0 months, respectively (p=0.13, Figure 1 ). The median OS was 61.6 months in the bortezomib group and not reached in the non-bortezomib group (p=0.22, Figure 2 ). There was no significant impact of high-risk cytogenetics, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) or b 2 microglobulin levels, or maintenance therapy on PFS or OS. Patient Characteristics And Outcomes .

The lack of benefit with bortezomib may be due to the inclusion of ATO and AA in the regimen, or the schedule of bortezomib, which was only given before melphalan.
