    "abstract_text": "ABR (Active BCR-related) is the only protein in humans and mice closely homologous to BCR. BCR acts as a tumor suppressor in different cancers, such as chronic myeloid leukemia and meningiomas. A putative anti-oncogenic role of ABR has been shown in tumors of the central nervous system, such as medulloblastoma and astrocytomas, in which deletion of ABR was found. However, the role of ABR in hematopoiesis or leukemia remains unclear. We hypothesized that ABR might be important for myelopoiesis via increasing the expression of C/EBP\u03b1, a transcription factor known to be pivotal for myeloid differentiation and functionally impaired in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In fact, we found that ABR expression is dramatically down-regulated ( Figure 1 , p =0.01) in bone marrow from AML patients (pts; n=63) compared to bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells from healthy donors (n=3). In agreement with this finding, Abr is significantly increased during M-CSF and G-CSF-stimulated differentiation of primary wild type mouse BM cells ( p <0.05). Additionally, we observe that ABR is necessary for monopoiesis induced by PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), since ABR knockdown in leukemic U937 cells results in a significant reduction of about 50% in the number of CD11b + cells 48h after PMA treatment ( p <0.05). Enforced ABR expression induces C/EBP\u03b1 and its targets M-CSFR , G-CSFR and microRNA (miR)-223 in U937 cells ( p <0.01). Moreover, we prove that ABR knockdown prevents induction of CEBPA , M-CSFR and G-CSFR during PMA-mediated differentiation ( p <0.05). ABR overexpression blocks cell-cycle progression and down-regulates the known C/EBP\u03b1 inhibitor E2F1 ( p <0.01) in U937 cells, indicating the functional role of ABR as tumor suppressor. Those data suggest that ABR might induce CEBPA expression via inhibition of cell cycle activator E2F1 . Finally, we are the first to identify ABR as a good prognostic factor in AML: patients with high ABR expression (median cut) survive significantly longer after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( Figure 2 , p =0.04, log-rank test). Furthermore, high ABR expression associates with a low percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood ( p =0.006) and high levels of antileukemic miR-181a ( p <0.001). In conclusion, these data indicate that ABR, a novel inducer of C/EBP\u03b1, is necessary for myelopoiesis and a prognostic factor in AML. Raising ABR levels might be a goal for future therapeutics in AML. View large Download slide View large Download slide  Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
