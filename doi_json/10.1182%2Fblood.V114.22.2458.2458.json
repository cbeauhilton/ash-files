    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2458 Poster Board II-435 Introduction: When used as therapy for hematopoietic malignances, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) relies on the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect to eradicate residual tumor cells through immunologic mechanisms. However, graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is a potentially lethal complication of allogeneic BMT. Thus, inhibition of GVHD, while preserving GVL and protective responses against infectious agents, can enhance the therapeutic potential of BMT. GVHD is initiated by alloreactive donor T cells that recognize mismatched major and/or minor histocompatibility antigens and cause severe damage to hematopoietic and epithelial tissues. Protein kinase C theta isoform (PKC\u03b8) is crucial in TCR signaling and regulates the nature of lymphocyte-specific effector responses. The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of PKC\u03b8 in donor T-cell-mediated GVHD, anti-leukemia, and antiviral infection. Methods: Our results were validated using clinically relevant murine bone marrow transplantation (BMT) models. GVHD was measured by recipient survival and clinical signs such as body weight loss. Leukemia/lymphoma was induced by intravenous injection of a luciferase expressing A20 clone (a B lymphoma cell line derived from BALB/c mice). Tumor invasion was quantitated using the Xenogen IVIS-200 bioluminescence imaging system. Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection was induced by intraperitoneally injecting MCMV in the recipients after GVHD was established. Results: Using 3 distinct mouse models of allogeneic BMT, we found that T cells lacking PKC\u03b8 are unable to undergo robust expansion and cause damage to recipient hematopoietic or epithelial tissues, demonstrating that an essential requirement for PKC\u03b8 in alloreactivity and GVHD development. In contrast, PKC\u03b8-/- T cells retain the ability to respond to virus infection post-BMT. Mechanistically, absence of PKC\u03b8 raises the threshold for T cell activation that selectively impacts alloresponses, but T cell responses triggered by infection or following administration of antigen plus microbial adjuvant are relatively well preserved in the absence of PKC\u03b8 Furthermore, we evaluated the role of PKC\u03b8 in GVHD and GVL responses, and found that PKC\u03b8-/- T cells have at least a 10-fold reduction in the ability to induce GVHD but only a \u223c2.5-fold reduction in GVL compared to WT T cells. Thus, absence of PKC\u03b8 impacts GVHD responses more significantly than GVL responses. Conclusion: These findings validate PKC\u03b8 as a potentially unique therapeutic target that is required for GVHD induction but not for GVL or protective responses to infectious agents in allogeneic BMT.
