    "abstract_text": "Introduction Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by the t(11:14)(q13:p32) translocation. MCL cells have altered cyclinD1 levels, impaired cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and likely defects in apoptosis signaling. Furthermore, up-regulated anti-apoptotic mediators such as the target of NF-\u03baB c-FLIP were correlated with decreased apoptosis signaling. Also many cancer cells and malignant tumors show a prevalent resistance to apoptosis induction by TRAIL. Thus, by understanding the underpinnings of apoptosis resistance, we will be in a better position to develop strategies that improve TRAIL-induced killing of lymphoma cells. Methods/Results MCL cell lines (Mino, JeKo-1, JVM-2 and Z-138) were treated with DZNep (3-Deazaneplanocin A; 0.2-5\u00b5M) for 24 h followed by incubation with TRAIL (10-20ng/ml, 6-16h). Cell death, DNA fragmentation, and mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8 m ) were determined by calcein staining, subG1 analysis, and TMRM staining, respectively. Neither DZnep alone nor in combination with TRAIL showed a significant induction of necrosis as determined by LDH-release levels, but DZNep alone showed strong antiproliferative properties at higher concentrations (Promega CellTiter 96 assay). Activation of the caspase signaling cascade (caspase-8, -9, -3, Bid, and PARP cleavage) was analyzed by Western blotting. TRAIL-induced signaling was significantly increased and caspase-8 processing enhanced in DZNep pretreated cells indicating a regulation at the TRAIL/DISC. Although a reduced expression of DR5 in total cell lysates of DZNep treated cell was observed, the surface receptor levels were not altered. Interestingly, downregulation of the well-known caspase inhibitor, cFLIP, correlated with the DZNep-induced increased TRAIL sensitivity in MCL cell lines. However, it appears that cFLIP levels are not reduced due to blocked NF-kB signaling but rather by an accelerated ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Conclusions This study reveals that inhibition of histone methyltransferase (EZH2) activity by DZNep has a profound positive impact on TRAIL signaling; it enhances TRAIL sensitivity by promoting processing of caspase-8 through enhanced cFLIP degradation. The capacity of DZNep to target stability of cFLIP, which represents a center piece in DISC regulation underscores its potential for enhancing efficacy of TRAIL-based cancer therapies.
