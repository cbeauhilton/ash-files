    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4455 Complaints of tiredness, lethargy or lack of energy are common in patients with chronic Immune ThrombocytoPenia (ITP), however they are not well understood. This study assessed whether different clinical and laboratory aspects are related to fatigue and how different therapeutic modalities might impact these symptoms. Methods Patients with chronic ITP older than 15 years old were enrolled from 2007-2008 at the Platelet Disorders Center at the Weill-Cornell Medical Center, NY. They completed the Short-Form 36 questionnaire (SF-36) and Fatigue severity scale (FSS) (2 standardized Health-related quality of life [HRQoL] questionnaires) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Laboratory testing included CBC, TSH, ferritin, iron + TIBC, and blood serotonin levels. Results 83 patients with a mean age of 40.2 years (67.5% women) were enrolled. The mean platelet counts were 109,000/ul (range of 12,000-500,000/ul). Forty-one % of patients had duration of ITP of 10 years or more and 25% had had previous splenectomy. Sixty-one% were on treatment: 11% steroids, 23% Tpo-R agents and 28% \u201cOther\u201d (7.2 % Rigel, 13.3 % IVIG, 3.6 % anti-D, 2.4 % rituximab and 1.2% Danazol/Azathioprine). Surprisingly, analysis of the SF36 showed that the study (ITP) population is similar to the general US population and that they do not report increased fatigue or depression. These results contrast with a previous report by McMillan, AJH, 2007 (fig 1). However when the current patients were divided according to age, abnormal low scores on SF36 were observed on vitality domain (mean 50) for the age group of 45-55 years and on role physical domain (mean 48) for the age group of 55-65 years. Furthermore, differences were observed in patients stratified according to treatment (figure 2) where the mean scores for patients on the steroid group on the respective domains were lower: vitality 49 and role physical 42. The Tpo-R agonists group had better results in all SF36 domains; similar findings were seen with the FSS and BDI. The only laboratory finding is that patients with low ferritin levels had worse results on FSS. Conclusion Although fatigue and related symptoms have been previously reported by others including an improvement with successful treatment eg in studies of the TPO-R agonists, to our surprise we did not find the same results. Whether this study population is intrinsically different or receiving different treatments, eg avoidance of steroids, might impact these results here are 2 possible hypotheses. Use of different fatigue assessments as ITP-PAQ or CDC symptom inventory and further studies addressing the role of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in these patients would be useful.
