    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients with CLL have a variable clinical course. Current novel prognostic indicators (ZAP-70, CD38, IgV H gene mutation status, FISH) are able to identify early-stage CLL patients at high risk of rapid disease progression. These prognostic factors focus on characteristics of the malignant B cell clone and are not currently changeable factors. Identification of modifiable characteristics of the host unrelated to the leukemic B-cell but that relate to CLL-specific survival may provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Since the immune system is likely to modulate disease progression in CLL patients, we evaluated critical features of that system in relation to the size of the circulating clonal B-cell population in a CLL cohort. Methods: 186 consecutive patients with CLL who were evaluated at Mayo Clinic within 2 months of diagnosis between 2000 and 2002 were identified. The primary end-point of the study was to assess if host immunity affected time to treatment (TTT). Baseline flow cytometry analysis was available for 166 patients (88%) and was used to calculate the absolute number of T-cell and natural kill (NK)-cells present at diagnosis. The size of the T-cell/NK-cell compartment relative to the size of the malignant monoclonal B-cell (MBC) compartment was then evaluated by calculating the NK:MBC ratio and T:MBC ratio. Relationships with other prognostic parameters and with TTT were evaluated. Results: Patients exhibited substantial variation in the absolute number of T-cells and NK cells as well as T:MBC and NK:MBC ratios at the time of diagnosis. Higher T:MBC and NK:MBC ratios were observed among patients with early Rai stage and mutated IgV H genes (all P\u22640.0002). As continuous variables, both the T:MBC ratio (p value=0.03) and NK:MBC ratio (p value=0.02) were associated with TTT. Since they correlated with TTT as continuous variables, thresholds to classify MBC, T:MBC ratio, and NK:MBC were identified using the method of Contal and O\u2019Quigly. On multivariate Cox modeling including stage, CD38, absolute MBC count, T:MB ratio, and NK:MB ratio, the independent predictors of TTT were disease stage, T:MB ratio, and NK:MB ratio (Table 1). Conclusion: Measurable characteristics of the host immune system appear to relate to the rate of disease progression in patients with newly diagnosed CLL. These characteristics can be modified and continued evaluation of immunomodulatory drugs, vaccination strategies, and cellular therapies to delay/prevent disease progression are warranted. Additional studies exploring how interactions between the host immune system and the leukemic clone influence clinical outcomes are needed.",
