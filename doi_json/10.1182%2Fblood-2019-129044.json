    "abstract_text": "Background: Therapy for chronic anemias is limited to RBC transfusions and Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) which often work on only transiently or not at all. New approaches to treat chronic anemia are needed but development has been limited by our incomplete understanding of erythropoiesis, most of which relates to the terminal maturation of erythroid precursors. Erythropoietin (Epo) acts during a very narrow window of erythropoiesis, well after progenitor commitment to an exclusively erythroid fate. It is not known if the final steps of RBC maturation are coupled to the earlier stages of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) differentiation; a process that begins almost three weeks earlier when an HSC starts its march towards committed RBC precursors via a series of branching cell fate decisions.We searched for independent control and compartmentalization of erythropoiesis that could couple early hematopoiesis to terminal erythroid commitment and maturation. Results: We deleted TGF\u03b21 in megakaryocytes ( TGF\u03b21 \u0394Mk/\u0394Mk ) and found that peripheral blood counts were normal in TGF\u03b21 \u0394Mk/\u0394Mk mice compared to TGF\u03b21 FL/FL controls despite the pool of primitive hematopoietic cells being expanded (Fig. 1a). Similarly total bone marrow cellularity was normal in TGF\u03b21 \u0394Mk/\u0394Mk mice (Fig. 1b). Excess HSCs in TGF\u03b21 \u0394Mk/\u0394Mk mice appeared capable of robust differentiation because the number of immature lineage-negative (Lin neg ) hematopoietic progenitor cells was increased in the marrows of TGF\u03b21 \u0394Mk/\u0394Mk mice (Fig. 1c). Thus, it remained unexplained why the expanded number of HSPCs (Fig. 1d) do not increase blood counts and marrow cellularity. We hypothesized that the excess progenitors observed in the TGF\u03b21 \u0394Mk/\u0394Mk mice failed to increase blood counts because their progeny were unneeded, and inadequately supported by homeostatic levels of late-acting cytokines. Indeed, bone marrow apoptosis was increased in the TGF\u03b21 \u0394Mk/\u0394Mk mice compared to controls, as reported by AnnexinV (AV) binding (Fig. 1e-f). Apoptosis of lineage-marker negative (Lin neg ), Kit + Sca1 neg (LKS neg ) HPCs and LKS + HSPCs was rare in both TGF\u03b21 \u0394Mk/\u0394Mk mice and littermate controls (Fig. 1g). These results suggest that excess, hematopoietic precursors present in the TGF\u03b21 \u0394Mk/\u0394Mk mice are pruned by apoptosis during hematopoietic differentiation. We found 10-fold apoptosis in TGF\u03b21 \u0394Mk/\u0394Mk precursors populations BM (Fig. 1h). Epo levels were normal in the serum of these mice, we reasoned that the excess, unneeded cells were not supported physiologic Epo levels. To test this, we treated mice with exogenous Epo. Indeed, we found that the excess erythroid apoptosis could be rescued by administration of very low doses of Epo (300U/kg)(Fig. 1i-j). Whereas TGF\u03b21 Flox/Flox mice showed minimal reticulocytosis and no change in blood counts, TGF\u03b21 \u0394Mk/\u0394Mk mice responded with reticulocytosis and erythrocytosis within 6 days (Fig. 1k-l). In contrast, treatment of mice with TGF\u03b21 worsened the erythroid apoptosis observed in TGF\u03b21 \u0394Mk/\u0394Mk mice and caused mild anemia. These results suggest that erythropoiesis is subject to modular regulation with megakaryocytic TGF\u03b21 constraining the pool of erythroid committed progenitors that are then licensed to mature via Epo signaling. We thought that blockade of TGF\u03b2 signaling could phenocopy these effects by inducing overproduction of erythroid committed precursors. To test this, we pre-treated B6 mice with a TGF\u03b21 neutralizing antibody (1D11) or non-targeting, isotype control antibody (13C4) and then either PBS or low-dose Epo (Fig. 1m). TGF\u03b2 neutralization by 1D11 reduced pSmad2/3 MFI in HSPCs in wild-type mice whereas the 13C4 control had no effect, demonstrating on-target activity (Fig. 1n). Low-dose Epo triggered a brisk erythropoietic response in mice treated with 1D11 but not those treated with the 13C4 control (Fig. 1o). Exogenous Epo rescued the erythroid precursor dropout observed in B6 mice treated with 1D11 but did not affect the low apoptosis observed in mice treated with the 13C4 control (Fig. 1p-r). Therefore, the boundary of megakaryocytic TGF\u03b21 activity is compartmentalized within the marrow with predominant effects on immature HSPCs while excluding their progeny (Fig. 4s). Conclusion: This work also promises new therapies for chronic anemias by combining TGF\u03b2 inhibitors to increase the outflow of immature progenitors with ESAs to support erythroid maturation.
