In addition to its expression in malignant cells, CD74 is also expressed in normal B cells, monocytes, macrophages, Langerhans cells, follicular and blood dendritic cells. A question therefore arises whether milatuzumab is toxic to or affects the function of these immune cells. This has important implications, not only for safe therapeutic use of this mAb, but also for its potential application as a novel delivery modality for in-vivo targeted vaccination. Methods: We assessed the binding profiles and functional effects of milatuzumab on human antigen-presenting cell (APC) subsets. Studies on the effect of milatuzumab on antigen presentation and cross-presentation are included. In addition, binding and cytotoxicity on a panel of leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and CLL patient cells were tested to demonstrate the range of malignancies that can be treated with this mAb. Results: Milatuzumab bound efficiently to different subsets of blood dendritic cells, including BDCA-1 + myeloid DCs (MDC1), BDCA-2 + plasmacytoid DCs (PDC), BDCA-3 + myeloid DCs (MDC2), B lymphocytes, monocytes, and immature DCs derived from human monocytes in vitro , but not LPS-matured DCs, which correlated well with their CD74 expression levels. In the malignant B-cells tested, milatuzumab bound to the surface of 2/3 AML, 2/2 mantle cell (MCL), 4/4 ALL, 1/1 hairy cell leukemia, 2/2 CLL, 7/7 NHL, and 5/6 multiple myeloma cell lines, and cells of 4/6 CLL patient specimens. Significant cytotoxicity ( P <0.05) was observed in 2/2 MCL, 2/2 CLL, 3/4 ALL, 1/1 hairy cell, 2/2 NHL, and 2/2 MM cell lines, and 3/4 CD74-positive CLL patient cells, but not in the AML cell lines following incubation with milatuzumab. In contrast, milatuzumab had minimal effects on the viability of DCs or B cells that normally express CD74. The DC maturation and DC-mediated T-cell functions were not altered by milatuzumab treatment, which include DC-induced T-cell proliferation, CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg expansion, and CD4+ nai\u0308ve T-cell polarization. Moreover, milatuzumab had little effect on CMV-specific CD8- and CD8+ T cell interferon-g responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated in vitro with CMV pp65 peptides or protein, suggesting that milatuzumab does not influence antigen presentation or cross-presentation. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that milatuzumab is a highly specific therapeutic mAb against B-cell malignancies with potentially minimal side effects. It also suggests that milatuzumab may be a promising novel delivery mAb for in vivo targeted vaccinations, given its efficient binding, but lack of cytotoxicity and functional disruption on CD74-expressing normal APCs.
