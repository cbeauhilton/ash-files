    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2815 Poster Board II-791 Background: The clonal plasma cells in AL can be considered malignant because they contain cytogenetic abnormalities, including t(11;14) in 40% to 50% of cases (Blood 2001;98:2266; 2008;111:4700; Haematologica 2009;94:380). By gene expression profiling (GEP) they are also reported to overexpress CCND1 (Blood 2005;105:794). To assess the frequency and significance of differences in CCND1 expression in plasma cells from AL patients at diagnosis, we evaluated the differences in CCND1 expression in CD138+ plasma cells from newly diagnosed patients. We then correlated these differences with features of both the deposition and clonal plasma cell diseases, and with treatments, outcomes and overall survival. Methods: Newly diagnosed AL patients were evaluated and CD138+ cells selected and used for GEP with Affymetrix U133 PLUS2.0 arrays (Affymetrix; Santa Clara, CA) or qRT-PCR as previously described (JNCCN 2007;5:179; Blood 2008;111:549). qRT-PCR was performed using TaqMAN Gene Expression Assays with CCND1 (Hs00277039_m1) and RPLP0 (Hs99999902_m1) primers and probes (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA) and 2 myeloma cell lines as positive and negative controls (KMS-12BM, RPMI 8226) on an Mx 3000P platform and related software (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA). The comparative Ct method was used and the amount of target was normalized to the control (2 -\u0394\u0394Ct ) assuming an efficiency of 2. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad PRISM (GraphPad; La Jolla, CA). Results: CD138+ cells from 58 newly diagnosed AL patients were evaluated. With GEP (n=16), CCND1 median log e -transformed quantitative expression levels were 11.08 (range, 9.6-11.55) in five versus 4.163 (3.875-5.447) in eleven patients ( P < 0.01). With qRT-PCR (n=42), relative CCND1 expression levels were 4.21 (1.76-17.24) in twenty versus 0.014 (0-0.99) in twenty-two patients ( P < 0.0001). Overall, 43% (25/58) of patients were CCND1+ and did not differ from CCND1- patients with respect to organ involvement, troponin I, urine total protein, creatinine or alkaline phosphatase levels. The median BNP of CCND1+ patients was 252pg/ml (range 20-1880), significantly higher than that of CCND1- patients (109pg/ml (5-4210), P < 0.05). CCND1+ patients tended to have more plasma cells (13% versus 8%, P = 0.06), higher serum free light chain levels (23.3 versus 14mg/dl, P = 0.12) and more kappa clones (6/25 versus 2/33, P = 0.06), and had fewer intact immunoglobulin M-proteins (4/25 versus 22/33, P < 0.01). There were no differences in frequencies of treatment with stem cell transplant or oral melphalan/dexamethasone or in the rates of complete hematologic responses. CCND1+ patients survived a median of only 27 months compared to 60 months for CCND1- patients ( P = 0.02) and had a risk of death of 2.86 (CI 1.18-6.94). Conclusions: Significant differences in CCND1 expression in the plasma cells of AL patients at diagnosis can be appreciated by GEP and qRT-PCR and clearly define two groups, CCND1+ and CCND1-, that differ in baseline BNP levels and features of the clonal plasma cell disease. Despite similar treatments and initial responses, CCND1+ patients have poorer overall survival, possibly due to asymptomatic cardiac involvement at diagnosis and low-level persistence of clonal plasma cells despite treatment, hypotheses that merit prospective evaluation.
