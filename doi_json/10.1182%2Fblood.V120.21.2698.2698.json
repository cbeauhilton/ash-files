    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2698 Background: Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is a small B cell neoplasm whose molecular pathogenesis is still unknown. It has a relatively indolent course, but a fraction of the cases may show an aggressive behavior. The lack of comprehensive molecular analysis for SMZL precludes the development of targeted therapy. Here we studied the mutational status of 6 SMZL samples using Whole Exome Next Generation Sequencing. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from splenic tumor or peripheral blood samples and oral mucosa as the corresponding non-tumor control. Whole exome sequencing was performed at CNAG (Barcelona, Spain) following standard protocols for high-throughput paired-end sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq2000 instruments (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). The variant calling was performed using an in house written software calling potential mutations showing a minimum independent multi-aligner evidence. Results: We performed paired-end-76pb whole exome sequencing on 6 SMZL samples and the corresponding normal counterpart. Three of the samples corresponded to CD19 isolated cells from peripheral blood, while other three corresponded to spleen freshly frozen tissue. The mean coverage obtained was 104.07 (82.46\u2013119.59) with a mean of 91.41% (90.41\u201393.73) of bases with at least 15\u00d7 coverage. After filtering, 237 substitutions and 21 indels where obtained. No recurrent variation was found. Six of the variations found here were already described in other malignancies. Variations were classified into silent (75), missense (147), nonsense (8), and essential splice (5), according to their potential functional effect, and into tolerated (54) and deleterious (76) according to the \u201cvariant effect predictor\u201d tool of Ensembl Genome Browser. Whole exome sequencing permitted us to identify variations in several genes of TLR/NFkB pathway (Myd88, Peli3), BCR (Myd88, Arid3A) or signal transduction (ARHGAP32), essential pathways for B-cell differentiation. These variations and other involving selected genes, such as the Bcl6 repressor BCOR, were validated by capillary sequencing. These results were confirmed and expanded in a second series of 10 new cases by exome sequencing. Conclusions: SMZL samples contain somatic mutation involving genes regulating BCR signaling, TLR/NFKB pathways and chromatin remodeling. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
