    "abstract_text": "Compelling murine studies demonstrate that adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing mediated by adenosine deaminase associated with RNA1 (ADAR1) is vital for both fetal and adult hematopoiesis. While genetic ablation of ADAR1 editase leads to murine embryonic lethality due to severe defects in erythropoiesis, conditional deletion in the hematopoietic system impairs maintenance indicative of cell type and context specific roles for ADAR1 in cell fate specification and self-renewal. By regulating mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) stability, ADAR1 exhibit wide-ranging effects on embryonic development and stem cell regulation. We have previously shown that inflammation-responsive ADAR1 plays important roles in both stem cell differentiation and self-renewal in CML (chronic myeloid leukemia) disease progression. Here, we describe a novel function of ADAR1 in cell cycle regulation of normal hematopoietic stem cell and progenitors (HSPC) by regulation of miRNA biogenesis. Our results demonstrated that ADAR1 induces G 0 to G 1 phase transition in normal cord blood HSPCs, as demonstrated by elevated expression of Ki67, reduced DiR signal, and enhanced in vivo cord blood engraftment. Cell cycle qRT-qPCR microarray of 84 cell cycle transcripts and whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing analysis of KEGG cell cycle pathway indicate that several cell cycle genes (CDKN1A, CDKN2A, CCNC, CCND1, BRCA2, etc) are differentially expression upon overexpression of ADAR1 WT or an A-to-I editing deficient ADAR1 mutant (ADAR1 E912A ). We previously demonstrated that impaired biogenesis of let-7 miRNAs by ADAR1 WT induces enhanced self-renewal in cord blood CD34 + HSPCs. To determine the miRNA targets of ADAR1-mediated RNA editing, we performed miRNome miScript PCR array of 1008 miRNA candidates in cord blood CD34 + HSPCs overexpressing ADAR1 WT or ADAR1 E912A . Total of 263 miRNAs were differentially expressed (142 upregulated and 121 downregulated) by comparing ADAR1 WT to the backbone control. Interestingly, ADAR1 E912A mutant also exhibit A-to-I editing independent regulation of miRNAs (307 upregulated and 59 downregulated). We found that the expression of miR-26a-5p, a miRNA frequently downregulated in leukemia, is inhibited by ADAR1-mediated RNA editing. ADAR1 directly binds and edits the DROSHA cleavage site of primary miR-26a transcript, thereby prevent miR26a-5p maturation. Moreover, lentiviral expression of mature miR26-5p reverses the effect of ADAR1 WT, including enhanced CDKN1A expression, inhibition of cord blood proliferation in vivo , as well as reduced HSC self-renewal as measured by colony-formation assay. Our finding suggests carefully regulated A-to-I editing by ADAR1 is essential for the maintenance of proper cell proliferation in HSC. For future study, it will be interesting to investigate if the elevated expression of ADAR1 in CML BC LSC contributes to false regulation of cell cycle that leads to the expansion of malignant leukemia stem cells.
