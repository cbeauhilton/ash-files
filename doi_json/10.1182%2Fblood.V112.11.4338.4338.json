    "abstract_text": "Until now few patients with renal failure on hemodialysis have undergone haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT), and none with thalassaemia. Case report. Patient of 45 years, UPN 168, with \u03b2 Thalassaemia major, genetic compound \u03b2 0 39 C-->T/\u03b2 0 6-A, non transfusible due to red blood cell immunization (positive DAT, Hb 5\u20137 g/dl), under hemodialytic treatment for three years for bilateral focal nephrosclerosis. He suffered from cardiopathy (atrial thrombosis, pulmonary hypertension, atrial and ventricular dilatation), hypothyroidism, hepatopathy (HCV positive with grade II haemosiderosis). Quality of life was much harmed by the severe chronic anaemia and nephropathy. In December 2007 we performed HSCT from his HLA identical brother. Conditioning regimen included: Busulfan (Bu) IV (Busilvex Pierre Fabre Me\u0301dicament) in single daily dose (3.5 mg/kg/day) for 4 days, Cyclophosphamide 40 mg/kg/day for 3 days. GvHD prophylaxis consisted of Cyclosporin 3 mg/kg/day IV (days -2 to +1), 2 mg/kg/day IV (days +2 to +42), changed to oral administration of 4 mg/kg/day from day +43. Hemodialysis was performed every other day in sterile room. Nucleated marrow cells infused: 4.4 \u00d7 10 8 /kg. A mixed chimerism (VNTR more than 90% donor) was documented at day +19. ANC >0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L at day +21. PLT >20 \u00d7 10 9 /L at day +15. Eight months after transplantation, patient is in good general condition, with stable mixed chimerism (more than 95% donor), haemoglobin above 11 g/dl, leucocytes and platelets in normal range. Substantial improvement of chronic anaemia ameliorated patient\u2019s quality of life and now patient can be considered a kidney transplant candidate. This single case report does not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn regarding HSCT suitability of patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis. We can observe that once-daily intravenous busulfan administration (after the hemodialysis session) has made it possible to keep therapeutic range, as has been ascertained by pharmacokinetic study of busulfan.",
