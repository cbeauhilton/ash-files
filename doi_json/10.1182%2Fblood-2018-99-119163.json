    "abstract_text": "Background: Financial Toxicity (FT) is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in a variety of cancers. Treatment of acute leukemia is associated with heavy healthcare utilization and high costs. The purpose of this study was to define rates, risk factors, and mortality implications for FT in patients with acute leukemia using patient reported data. Methods: All patients seen at the Levine Cancer Institute, a tertiary hospital-based leukemia practice, were surveyed prior to each visit over a six-month period. All patients were aged \u226518 years and were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The survey consisted of the PROMIS Global-10 measure and two questions from the COST measure. FT was defined as scoring 4 or less (maximum: 10) in agreement with the COST questions: \"I know that I have enough money in savings, retirement, or assets to cover the costs of my treatment\" and \"I am satisfied with my current financial situation.\" Demographic data and disease characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. Model selection was carried out using logistic regression to identify factors impacting the incidence of financial toxicity. Correlation of numerical financial toxicity scores with PROMIS scores and with mortality data was assessed using linear regression. Results: Of the 106 patients, 58 (54%) met the definition of exhibiting FT. The factors associated with incidence of FT included: age, race, and insurance type. The odds of FT in those patients 4 compared to patients with FT scores <=4; however, there was a trend toward decreased survival in those with lower FT scores (Figures 1 and 2). Conclusions: Patients with acute leukemia represent an extremely vulnerable population for financial toxicity with rates of distress even higher than other reported malignancies. Urgent interventions are indicated in this population.
