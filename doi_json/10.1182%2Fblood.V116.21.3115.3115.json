    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3115 Background. Rituximab significantly improves the outcome of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, but it does not completely eradicate residual B-cell populations in the bone marrow (BM) and lymph nodes (LN). The architecture and gene expression profile of LN stromal cells in diffuse large cell lymphoma correlates with outcome following treatment with R-CHOP (Lenz et al. 2008). Interestingly, multiple studies have demonstrated the importance of B-cells adhesion and pro-survival signaling mediated by integrin alfa-4-beta-1 (VLA-4/CD49d), which is constitutively expressed on malignant B-cells. Although several studies have demonstrated that adhesion to stromal cell cultures or ligand coated surfaces can protect malignant B-cells from apoptosis induced by chemotherapy drugs (cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR); Dalton, 2002), a similar mechanism of resistance to rituximab has not, to our knowledge, been described. Hypothesis. In this study we tested the hypothesis that interactions with the microenvironment protect malignant B-cells from rituximab induced apoptosis, and that targeting these interactions with natalizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-alfa-4 antibody approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease, can overcome this protection. Methods. Lymphoma B-cell lines were cultured on either a plastic surface, confluent HS-5 cells or a fibronectin (alfa-4-beta-1 ligand) coated surface. HS-5 is an immortalized human bone marrow stromal cell line and a well characterized model for a component of the BM microenvironment (Roecklein and Torok-Storb, 1995). Cells were treated with rituximab (10 ug/mL; Genentech), natalizumab (10ug/mL; Biogen IDEC), control IgG (10ug/mL, Sigma-Aldrich). Cell viability was measured by flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC, propidium iodide in malignant B-cell population (anti-CD19 antibody, BD PharMingen). Results. We studied ten CD20-positive B-cell lymphoma cell lines and the CD20-positive MEC-1 cell line (derived from prolymfocytoid transformation of CLL) for rituximab induced apoptosis. The four most rituximab sensitive cell lines were used for further experiments (Karpas-422, Raji, DOHH2, SUDHL-4). Cell lines were co-cultured for 24hrs with confluent HS-5 stromal cells and subsequently treated for 24hrs with rituximab. The percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly lower (17-23% vs. 30\u201342%, p<0.05) for cells co-cultured with HS-5 cells compared to control cells cultivated under the same conditions on the plastic surface for all four cell lines. Similar results were obtained for several primary CLL samples (3-5% vs. 13\u201318%, p<0.05). We next examined if natalizumab could disrupt cell adhesion to fibronectin and overcome the stromal cell-mediated resistance to rituximab. Natalizumab reduced the number of lymphoma cells that adhered to fibronectin by 75\u201395% (p<0.05). Moreover, adherent cells cultivated on fibronectin coated surface completely lost the adhesion morphology after the addition of natalizumab to the cultivation media. The combination of natalizumab and rituximab versus rituximab alone increased by 26\u201332% (p<0.05) the number of apoptotic B-cells in co-culture with HS-5 for three of four rituximab-responding cell lines. Conclusion. We have shown that human bone marrow stromal cells (HS-5) protect lymphoma B cells from rituximab induced apoptosis suggesting existence of stromal cell adhesion-mediated antibody resistance (CAM-AR) analogous to CAM-DR. Targeting integrin alfa-4-beta-1 with natalizumab partially overcomes this cell adhesion-mediated resistance to rituximab.
