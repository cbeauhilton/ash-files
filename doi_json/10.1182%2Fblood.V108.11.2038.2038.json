    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND The UPR is a prosurvival pathway activated in cells under ER stress induced by the accumulation of unfolded proteins. UPR activation in B cells normally occurs during the differentiation to antibody secreting plasma cells and requires XBP1activation. XBP-1 is a member of the TREB family of transcription factors that exists in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a 33kDa protein, and in the nucleus as an active 50kDa transcription factor. The UPR stimulates two different ER proteins, ATF-6 and Ire-1, to increase XBP-1 transcription and XBP-1 mRNA splicing resulting in the accumulation of the active 50kDa nuclear protein. Moreover XBP1 is a target of proteosome inhibitors and is related to the aggressive behaviour of some carcinomas. The role of the activation of XBP-1 in lymphomas is still unknown. DESIGN: Reactive lymphoid tissues and 25 neoplastic human B-cell lines representing different stages of B-cell development were studied for XBP-1 expression by western blot and XBP-1, PAX-5, Blimp-1/prdm1, MUM-1/IRF-4 and ICSBP1/IRF-8 by immunohistochemistry. XBP-1 activation was assessed in 225 B-cell lymphomas from the archives of the laboratory of pathology by western blot, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry . To further evaluate whether XBP-1 activation was related to the plasmacytic program or to ER stress signals we analyzed the cell lines by Western blot for XBP-1 and ATF-6 expression. RESULTS We characterize XBP-1 expression in reactive lymphoid tissues, 25 human cell lines and 225 B-cell tumors. In nearly all tonsillar lymphoid cells XBP-1 was detected as a cytoplasmic protein with a paranuclear dot pattern. Nuclear positivity was observed only in scattered centrocytes in the light zone of the germinal centers and in plasma cells, always coexpressed with plasma cell related transcription factors as MUM-1/IRF-4 and Blimp1/prdm1. Active p50XBP-1 was found in 24/25 cell lines by western blot regardless ATF-6 expression and confirmed by immunohistochemistry . Moreover p50XBP1 was found in 27/31(87%) plasmacytomas, 36/64(56%) DLBCL-ABC and in 3/10(30%) DLBCL-GCB and 22/43(51%) plasmablastic lymphomas. Intriguingly, p50XBP1 was detected also in 2/11(18%)BL and 4/25(16%)MCL with blastic features. CONCLUSIONS. XBP-1 is activated in a subset of follicular centre cells committed to plasma cell differentiation and in plasma cells. UPR prosurvival pathways in the neoplastic cell lines are activated independently of the extent of the ATF-6 activation. p50XBP1 is mostly activated in aggressive B-cell lymphomas regardless to the plasmacytic differentiation of the tumours. Thus, p50XBP-1 may be a new molecular target in the treatment of aggressive B-cell malignancies."
