    "abstract_text": "Prognosis of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms developing blast phase (MPN-BP) is very poor with a median survival of about 2-3 months; nowadays, no treatment can induce a durable complete response (CR) in patients who are not candidate to BMT. Very recently, a possible role of azacytidine (AZA) was reported in these patients, but there is still a lack of data as to its efficacy; to address this issue, we evaluated retrospectively 19 patients (M/F 15/4 F, median age 71.3 years, interquartile range (IQR) 64.5 \u2013 77.7] with MPN-BP treated with AZA and collected in the database of our cooperative group. The primary MPN diagnosis was Essential Thrombocythemia in 6 cases (31,6%), Policythemia Vera in 3 (15,8%), Primary Myelofibrosis in 7 (36,8%) and MDS/MPN in 3 (15,8%); the JAK-2 V617F mutation was present in 11/17 patients tested (64.7%). All but 1 patient received previous chemotherapies during chronic phase. Median time from diagnosis to BP evolution was 52.6 months (IQR 11.2 \u2013 181.8). All patients were treated with AZA at the standard dosage of 75 mg/m 2 : 16 patients received a 7-day schedule and 3 a 5-day schedule every 28 days. Two patients died early after 5-AZA initiation for pulmonary fungal infection and respiratory failure respectively, 4 patients had a disease progression, 4 patients maintained stable disease, 3 patients had a hematological improvement, 1 patient achieved partial response and 5 patients (26.3%) a CR after 4, 4, 4, 5, and 12 months. The median cumulative survival from BP evolution was 9.9 months (95%CI 6.7 \u2013 13.1).A comparison with the historical cohort of 72 patients of our database presenting MPN-BP and treated with approaches other than AZA (median cumulative survival 3.1 months, 95%CI 1.1 \u2013 5.1) showed a significant advantage for patients treated with AZA (p= 0.02). Our data confirm the relative good efficacy and safety of AZA in this group of patients with otherwise dismal prognosis, underlining the possible achievement of long-lasting responses in a sizeable portion of them.
