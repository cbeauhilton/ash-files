    "abstract_text": "Background Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT) is a well-established procedure that, with or without gene therapy, is curative for numerous severe life-threatening diseases including genetic blood disorders and blood cancers. While advances have been made, there are still substantial concerns since these chemo- and radiation therapy based procedures cause long-term toxicities such as infertility and secondary malignancies or even result in high mortality. We have previously established in a series of preclinical studies a novel chemo- and radiation-free non-toxic monoclonal antibody (Ab) -based conditioning regimen for autologous and allogeneic HSCT (Czechowicz et al., Akanksha et al. and George et al.). This cKIT-CD47 Ab-based regimen selectively depletes host HSCs for HSCT while sparing off-target toxicities caused by chemotherapy/radiation. By significantly decreasing morbidity/mortality associated with traditional conditioning regimens, antibody-mediated conditioning could expand the patient population eligible to receive HSCT for a variety of disorders. We developed a novel cKIT Ab (FSI-174), with an active Fc, and in combination with our CD47 magrolimab (previously 5F9, blocks the don't eat me pathway) could be utilized to translate the promising preclinical findings into clinical studies for safe and less toxic bone marrow conditioning for HSCT. Here we present the functional characterization of FSI-174 as single Ab and in combination with magrolimab in vitro and in non-human primate (NHP) studies. Methods We tested if FSI-174 could block stem cell factor signaling and we explored if FSI-174 alone or in combination with magrolimab could promote phagocytosis of cKIT positive cells (Kasumi-1). In addition, we determined if FSI-174 could cause mast cell degranulation. Subsequently, we explored the potential of FSI-174 alone (Phase A) or in combination with magrolimab (Phase B) to deplete HSCs in NHPs (rhesus macaques) in vivo . In Phase A, single doses of FSI-174 (0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg) were administered alone. In Phase B, FSI-174 (0.3 or 3 mg/kg) was administered in combination with magrolimab (5mg/kg priming and 20 mg/kg maintenance dose). Bone marrow aspirates and core biopsies and peripheral blood were sampled before the study start and throughout the study. Frequency of bone marrow HSCs and cKIT receptor occupancy (RO) was determined by flow cytometry. In addition, the PK profile of FSI-174 was determined. Results In-vitro analysis demonstrated that FSI-174 decreases proliferation of HSPCs and enhances phagocytosis of cKIT positive cells, and the addition of magrolimab synergistically enhances the phagocytosis. Strikingly, FSI-174 did not cause mast cell degranulation in vitro. In the NHPs, complete (100%) cKIT receptor occupancy was achieved at all FSI-174 dose levels and was maintained for 1 to 9 days correlating with increasing doses and pharmacokinetics. The FSI-174 Cmax was found to be proportional to dose and mean Cmax increased from 6.25 ug/mL to 49.2 ug/mL. In Phase A, FSI-174 alone did not decrease the frequency of bone marrow HSCs compared to PBS control and had no effect on the peripheral blood cell counts. However, in Phase B, when FSI-174 was combined with magrolimab it significantly decreased the frequency of bone marrow HSCs with the nadir at day 9 and no recovery over 85 days compared to PBS control. Notably, there were no changes in peripheral blood cell counts over the course of the studies with no cytopenias in combination treatment. Conclusions We have developed a novel cKIT Ab (FSI-174) that meets the desired profile of stem cell factor block, promotion of phagocytosis, but without promoting mast cell degranulation. Furthermore, in the NHPs studies we have confirmed our chemo- and radiation-free cKIT-CD47 Ab -based conditioning approach with FSI-174 and magrolimab. As anticipated by our previous preclinical studies, monotherapy with FSI-174 does not deplete bone marrow HSCs in NHPs. Notably, no cytopenias are observed with either monotherapy or combination therapy. These data demonstrate the specificity, efficacy and safety of FSI-174/ magrolimab combination have great potential for conditioning regimen for HSCT in a chemotherapy and radiation free manner. Given the favorable safety profile of magrolimab across several clinical studies, these results are paving the way to the first-in-human trials for this novel conditioning for HSCT.
