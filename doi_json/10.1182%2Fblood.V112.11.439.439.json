    "article_title": "Iron Chelation in Regularly Transfused Patients with Aplastic Anemia: Efficacy and Safety Results from the Large Deferasirox EPIC Trial ",
    "article_date": "November 16, 2008",
    "session_type": "Bone Marrow Failure",
    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients with aplastic anemia (AA) can be effectively treated with bone marrow transplantation or immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy, but many will require repeated blood transfusions to manage symptoms of severe anemia and are subsequently at risk of accumulating excessive body iron. Reduction in iron burden across a range of transfusion-dependent anemias, including AA, has been previously demonstrated with deferasirox (Exjade \u00ae ). More recently, the EPIC trial enrolled the largest cohort of patients with AA undergoing iron chelation to date. The efficacy and safety of deferasirox in these patients are presented. Methods: Enrolled patients had transfusion-dependent AA and serum ferritin (SF) levels of \u25a11000 ng/mL, or 20 transfusions or 100 mL/kg of red blood cells) and an R2 MRI-confirmed liver iron concentration (LIC) >2 mg Fe/g dry weight. Deferasirox was administered at an initial dose of 10\u201330 mg/kg/day depending on transfusion requirements, with dose adjustments in steps of 5\u201310 mg/kg/day (in the range 0\u201340 mg/kg/day) based on assessment of SF trends and safety markers indicative of iron toxicity. SF was assessed every 4 weeks and the primary efficacy endpoint was the change at week 52 from baseline. Safety assessments included adverse event (AE) monitoring and assessment of laboratory parameters. Results: In total, 116 AA patients (67 males, 49 females; mean age 33.3 years) were enrolled. Median baseline SF was 3254.0 ng/mL; patients received a mean of 115.8 mL/kg of blood in the year prior to enrollment. Approximately two-thirds of patients (68.1%) had received no prior chelation therapy. Of those who had, patients received deferoxamine (DFO; n=31, 26.7%) or combination DFO/deferiprone (n=6, 5.2%). After 12 months, median SF decreased significantly by 964.0 ng/mL from baseline median of 3254.0 ng/mL ( P =0.0003). This occurred at an average actual deferasirox dose of 17.6\u00b14.8 mg/kg/day. The median change in SF from baseline was \u2013970.0 ng/mL ( P <0.0001; 3263.0 ng/mL [baseline]; 0.20 mg/kg/day [mean iron intake]) in patients receiving a mean actual deferasirox dose <20 mg/kg/day (n=75) and \u2212883.8 ng/mL ( P =0.27; 3238.0 ng/mL [baseline]; 0.29 mg/kg/day [mean iron intake]) in those receiving 20\u201395%). 29 patients (25.0%) had an increase in serum creatinine >33% above baseline and the upper limit of normal (ULN) on two consecutive visits; there were no progressive increases. One patient (0.9%) had an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) that exceeded >10xULN on two consecutive visits; ALT levels were elevated in this patient at baseline. Conclusions: Over a 1-year treatment period, deferasirox significantly reduced iron burden in transfusion-dependent, iron overloaded patients with AA. Despite the high iron burden, most patients had received no prior chelation therapy, indicating a clear need for iron chelation in this patient population. Overall, deferasirox was generally well tolerated in these AA patients with the majority of AEs being mild to moderate.",
