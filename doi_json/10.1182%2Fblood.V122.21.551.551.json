    "abstract_text": "Introduction A randomized multicenter study of 134 Follicular Lymphoma (FL) patients, selected for age less than 60 yrs. and poor prognostic features according to age-adjusted IPI (2-3) and IIL-score (3 or greater) was conducted between March 2000 and May 2005, among 30 Italian Centers. The study compared efficacy and tolerability of CHOP-R vs. R-HDS with autograft as primary treatment in poor-risk FL. Initial results have been already reported (Ladetto M et al, Blood 2008), showing superior disease control with R-HDS without any survival advantage. We have recently updated the long-term outcome and the results at long-term are here presented at a median follow-up of 9.5 yrs. Patients and Methods Of the original 134 randomized patients, the long-term outcome has been updated for 125 patients, 61 of CHOP-R and 64 of R-HDS arms. Clinical characteristics at study entry and treatment schedules have been already reported. Briefly, the main features of the updated patients included: median age 51 yrs. (22-60), M/F ratio 74/51, aaIPI 2-3 90%, FLIPI >2 (retrospectively assigned) 60%, high LDH 49%, bulky disease 62%, B-symptoms 45%, BM involvement 86%. Clinical characteristics were balanced among the two arms. Treatment schedule consisted of: i. standard arm: 6 courses of cyclo-phosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone followed by 4-weekly rituximab courses (CHOP-R); ii. experimental arm: rituximab-supplemented high-dose sequential chemotherapy with autografting (R-HDS). The analysis was intention to treat with event-free survival as the primary endpoint. Minimal residual disease was evaluated post treatment in 58 patients with a bcl-2/IgH MBR or mcr translocation confirmed at diagnosis by nested PCR. The trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as no. NCT00435955. The long-term outcome has been updated in July 2013 by 28 out of 30 participating Centers accounting for 125 patients (93% of the whole series). Results Complete remission (CR) was achieved by 88 (70.4%) patients, including 35 (57%) with CHOP-R and 53 (83%) with R-HDS (p < .001); in addition, 37 out of 58 (64%) patients achieved a Molecular Remission (MR). At a median follow-up (MFU) of 9.5 yrs., 88 patients (70.4%) are alive. Overall, 19 patients died for lymphoma progression (11 in the CHOP-R, 8 in the R-HDS arms), there were nine deaths for secondary malignancy (3 in the CHOP-R, 6 in the R-HDS arms), nine more patients died for other causes, including four early toxic deaths. The overall survival projection for the whole series is 78% and 70% at 5 and 10 yrs., respectively. As shown in Figure 1 , there were no main differences in the long-term OS between the two arms, with 5 and 10 yrs projections respectively of 75% and 70% for CHOP-R and 81% and 70% for R-HDS (p=0.96). Response to primary treatment had a major impact on the OS, with 5 and 10 yr survival projections respectively of 90% and 80% for patients achieving CR, and of 49 and 43 for those with less than CR (p < .001) ( Figure 2A ). Similarly, MR achievement was associated with prolonged overall survival, with 5 and 10 yr survival projections respectively of 89% and 83% for patients with PCR-ve on BM cells, and of 76 and 57 for those with persistent PCR-positivity (p = .03) ( Figure 2B ).

Thus, efforts are still needed in order to increase the anti-tumor efficacy while reducing any potential late effect in treatment options for FL.
