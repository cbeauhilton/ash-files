    "abstract_text": "Chromosomal rearrangements have been associated with many hematologic malignancies. Identification of the genes involved in several of these rearrangements has provided information about the development of malignancy and has led to therapeutic interventions. Historically, a considerable number of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases have been reported as cytogenetically normal. However, with improved cytogenetic techniques and the use of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), new translocations are now being identified. We present the case of a 10-year-old male with AML (FAB subtype M1) and a subtle chromosomal translocation. G-band karyotype analysis revealed a balanced, reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 17 and 19 involving bands 17q23 and 19q13. This translocation was present in 20 out of 20 bone marrow cells examined. Peripheral blood chromosome analysis ruled out a constitutional chromosomal abnormality. Metaphase FISH with telomere-region specific probes for chromosomes 17 and 19 confirmed the reciprocal translocation between 17q and 19q. This patient was treated according to the SJCRH AML 2002 protocol and was randomized to receive high-dose cytarabine. Because he had minimal residual disease following induction therapy, he also received Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin. The patient was in cytogenetic remission for one year after completion of therapy, and then he relapsed with the original leukemic clone and additional cytogenetic abnormalities. The t(17;19)(q23;q13) has not been reported previously in malignancies or other disorders, and therefore identification of the genes at the chromosomal breakpoints may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of AML. As an initial step to map the breakpoint regions, we performed FISH with a commercially available probe encompassing the CRX, GLTSCR2, and GLTSCR1 loci on 19q13 (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL). This revealed that the 19q breakpoint is centromeric to these loci. We are further mapping the translocation breakpoint region on chromosome 19q using FISH-mapped bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs).",
