    "abstract_text": "Background: Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is the most common NHL type in children. Although treatment for pediatric BL has improved significantly, there is an urgent need for novel therapies that reduce the toxicity of modern treatment regimens and improve on the dismal survival observed in the relapsed/refractory setting where only about 20-30% of patients survive their disease. Recent reports have implicated co-activation of c-Myc and PI3K in Burkitt lymphomagenesis. Genomic analysis of recurrent oncogenic mutations in BL have identified tonic B-cell receptor signaling and the over-expression of Myc induced microRNAs from the MIR17-92 family, e.g. mir17 and mir19, as possible mechanisms of PI3K activation in BL. Mir17 and mir19, have been implicated in Burkitt lymphomagenesis and their overexpression may be associated with a higher risk of relapse. The protein phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a major regulator of PI3K pathway activation. MIR17-92 cluster members have been shown to target PTEN leading to increased PI3K activation. We have previously identified increased expression of mir17 and mir19 along with increased activation of AKT in cell line models of chemotherapy resistant BL suggesting a potential mechanism for increased resistance. BET bromodomains interact with chromatin and enhance transcriptional activation of numerous genes including c-Myc. Thus, BET bromodomains represent a promising target in BL. To investigate the effects of inhibition of c-Myc driven activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, we characterized the activity of the highly potent small molecule bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 in chemotherapy sensitive and resistant BL cell lines. Additionally, we analyzed the ability to enhance anti-lymphoma activity of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibition in BL by the combination of BET bromodomain inhibition and targeted inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Methods: The in vitro activity of JQ1 was investigated in the BL cell lines Raji, Raji 4RH (chemotherapy-rituximab resistant), Raji 8RH (rituximab resistant), Ramos, and Daudi. Cell Viability following exposure to JQ1 alone and in combination with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor omipalisib (GSK458)) was analyzed using Cell-Titer Glo or Alamar Blue assays following 24, 48, and 72 hour exposure over a range of inhibitor concentrations. Induction of apoptosis was analyzed using western blotting for cleaved PARP. C-Myc expression following JQ1 exposure was determined by western blot following 48 hour JQ1 exposure. The effect of JQ1 exposure on the expression of c-Myc induced microRNA expression was determined by qRT-PCR in cells exposed to JQ1 for 48hours. Synergy of combination exposures was determined using CalcuSyn to generate combination index (CI) values. Results: In vitro exposure of BL cell lines to JQ1 for 24, 48, and 72 hours resulted in a significant dose and time dependent decrease in viable cells (72 hour IC50 values: Raji 0.12\u00b5M, Raji 4RH 1.7\u00b5M, Raji 8RH 0.7\u00b5M, Ramos 0.22\u00b5M and Daudi 4\u00b5M). There was an increase in cleaved PARP after 72 hour exposure indicating induction of apoptosis. While single agent effect was seen in the resistant Raji 4RH cell line, activity was noted to primarily occur at the higher end of the dosing. Western blot analysis demonstrated a reduction in c-Myc expression following exposure to JQ1 1\u00b5M for 24 hours (relative band intensity normalized to control: Raji=0.12, Raji 4RH=0.18, Raji 8RH=0.11). qPCR showed a reduction in Mir17 relative transcription levels after 48 hours of exposure to JQ1 2.5mM (relative expression compared to control: Raji=0.72, Raji 4RH=0.98, Raji 8RH=0.83, Ramos=0.57, Daudi=0.46). When combined with omipalisib, an increased effect on cell viability was noted. The combination effect was noted to be synergistic (CI<0.9) at multiple dose combinations while other combinations exhibited primarily additive effects. Conclusion: In vitro inhibition of BET bromodomains with JQ1 results in a decrease in c-Myc expression and a decrease in c-Myc dependent miR expression with impaired proliferation and induction of apoptosis in chemotherapy-sensitive and -resistant BL cell lines. Augmented, and in some cases synergistic, activity is also noted with dual inhibition of BET bromodomains and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in BL cell lines.
