    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Pegaspargase(PEG-ASP) and L-asparaginase(L-ASP) has been widely used in the treatment of acute lymphatic leukemia, changes of coagulation function after treatment are not actually the same. So we performed the present study to analyze coagulation disorder after PEG-ASP and L-ASP treatment of adults with acute lymphatic leukemia. Methods and materials: Totally 153 hospitalized patients with acute lymphatic leukemia treated with L-ASP or PEG-ASP were studied from January, 2010 to January, 2015. Of all 153 patients analyzed, they received L-ASP treatment 158 dose times and PEG-ASP treatment 60 dose times respectively. Results: There is no difference of the distribution of age, sex, white blood cell count at diagnosis and risk factors of the disease. Agranulocytosis combining with intestinal infection, bleeding or thrombosis and the inducing remission rate between the two groups has no significant difference ( p =0.11,0.61,0.33). The total infusion of fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen after treatment shows no significant difference between the two groups ( p =0.11,0.75,0.21).Fibrinogen level decreases slower in the treatment of PEG-ASP(9.37 day vs 7.40 day, p =0.02) than that of L-ASP. What's more, fibrinogen decreases slower when L-ASP used at interval compared with continuous use, however, the incidence rate of bleeding and related complications is higher when used at interval early ( p =0.028). Conslusion: Because of the preponderance to monitor the changes of fibrinogen and the equal rate of complications and inducing remission rate, it is recommended to use PEG-ASP. L-ASP used at interval can monitor the coagulation function easily than continuous use, but the early use of L-ASP may overlay the drug side effects and related hematology toxicity caused by chemotherapy, then cause an increased incidence of complications.
