    "abstract_text": "Graft CD34+ cell content based on ABW affects outcome after conventional allografts ( Singhal et al. BMT 2000 ; 26 : 489 \u201396 ). Engraftment after autologous ( Ali et al. BMT 2003 ; 31 : 861 \u20134 ) and allogeneic ( Cilley et al. BMT 2004 ; 33 : 161 \u20134 ) HSCT correlates better with CD34+ cell dose based on IBW than ABW. 63 patients (27\u201366 y, median 52) underwent submyeloablative HSCT from HLA-matched sibling (n=37), 10/10 allele-matched unrelated (n=19), or 1-locus/allele mismatched (n=7) donors for hematologic malignancies after 100 mg/m 2 melphalan with (n=42; no prior autograft) or without (n=21; prior autograft) 50 mg/kg cyclophosphamide. GVHD prophylaxis comprised cyclosporine-mycophenolate with HLA-matched sibs and tacrolimus-mycophenolate with the rest. G/GM-CSF were not used. Supportive care was uniform. ABW and IBW values were 45\u2013147 kg (median 79) and 52\u201385 kg (median 67) respectively. The ABW-IBW difference was \u221224% to +133% (median +16%); 9 patients were >5% underweight and 41 were >5% overweight. Chemotherapy doses were based on ABW for underweight patients, and adjusted weight for overweight (IBW + 25% of the ABW-IBW difference). The target CD34+ cell dose was 2\u20138 x10 6 /kg IBW; preferably >6 and \u2264 8 based on prior findings (Singhal et al. ASH 2004). The CD34+ cell dose infused was 1.4\u201311.8 (median 5) by IBW and 1.2\u20139.3 (median 4.5) by ABW. The CD3+ cell dose (10 8 /kg) was 0.9\u201314.9 (median 3) by IBW and 0.7\u201319.7 (median 2.7) by ABW. The 2-y cumulative incidence of relapse and transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 55% and 24% respectively. The 2-y probabilities of overall (OS) and disease-free (DFS) survival were 35% and 21% respectively. . CD34+ cell dose by IBW .

When ABW was used with the same numeric thresholds, the differences were less marked and not significant. The figures show the effect of the CD34+ cell dose on DFS and the CD3+ cell dose on OS.

Based on these findings and our prior work on engraftment, we suggest using IBW rather than ABW to calculate cell doses for HSCT; for statistical analyses and for clinical practice if a specific cell dose is being targeted.",
