    "abstract_text": "Background. The predominant renal elimination of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has raised concerns regarding the safety of therapeutic dose LMWH in patients with renal impairment, particularly those with Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30 ml/min. Anti-Xa levels are used a surrogate measure of bleeding risk in patients receiving LMWH, with trough levels used as a measure of LMWH accumulation. Tinzaparin may be less dependent on renal clearance compared to other LMWHs. Aims. To assess for tinzaparin accumulation in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and varying degrees of renal impairment using serial trough anti-Xa level measurements. The degree of accumulation occurring in patients with CrCl <30 ml/min was further evaluated by subdividing patients with CrCl <30 ml/min into those with CrCl 20-29 ml/min and <20 ml/min. Methods. Prospective multicenter cohort study of patients with objectively confirmed VTE treated with tinzaparin (Tinzaparin in Renal Insufficient Venous Thromboembolism (TRIVET) study; NCT00186745). Informed consent was obtained and the study approved by the ethics board at each site. Patients were stratified into 4 groups based on calculated CrCl (ml/min): >60, 30-60, <30 and hemodialysis (HD)-dependent. Tinzaparin 175 IU/kg was administered subcutaneously once daily for up to 7 days. Trough anti-Xa levels were measured twice, prior to the 3 rd - 5 th dose and prior to the 5 th - 7 th dose of tinzaparin. Accumulation was defined as anti-Xa >0.5 IU/mL which resulted in a predefined dose reduction. Bleeding and recurrent thrombotic events were recorded. Results. 148 patients were enrolled from 5 centers (Table 1). A total of 29 patients had CrCl <30 ml/min but were not dialysis dependent. Of these, 22 patients had CrCl 20-29 ml/min and 7 patients had CrCl <20 ml/min. The mean trough anti-Xa levels following 2-4 doses of therapeutic dose tinzaparin (1 st measurement) and 4-6 doses of tinzaparin (2 nd measurement) were similar. Using CrCl >60 ml/min as the comparison, trough anti-Xa levels were significantly higher in CrCl <30 ml/min and HD-dependent patients (p<0.005) although the increase in levels were most notable with CrCl <20 ml/min, as opposed to CrCl 20-29 ml/min. Conclusion. Therapeutic dose tinzaparin is associated with higher mean trough anti-Xa levels in patients with CrCl <30 ml/min and HD-dependent patients. In patients with CrCl <30 ml/min, anti-Xa levels were higher in those with CrCl <20 ml/min compared to 20-29 ml/min.
