To ensure it's proper application, it is important to set clear criteria when it is an appropriate type of treatment. MRD status of the patient after auto-HSCT could be such a criteria, than can be used to stratify the risk of relapse and justify the MT. Aims: To assess the efficacy of MT in patients with MM achieving a complete response after auto-HSCT accounting on whether or not they have minimal residual disease. Patients and Methods: Fifty-two patients with MM (19 male and 33 female, 24 to 66 years old - median, 54 years) who had achieved a complete response after auto-HSCT were enrolled in a prospective randomized clinical study in the period from January 2014 to February 2016. Subjects were at the following stages of the disease (ISS): 11 at Stage I, 23 at Stage II, and 18 at Stage III. The remission induction protocol included: bortezomib-containing regimens (VCD, PAD) for all 52 patients, immunomodulatory agents for 8, and bendamustine for 2. Distribution of patients by type of anti-tumor responses (according to the International Myeloma Working Group classification criteria) after induction was as follows: complete response in 26 patients (50 %), very good partial response in 12 subjects (23 %), and partial response in 5 individuals (27 %). Single auto-HSCT was used in 36 subjects and tandem auto-HSCT in 16. At 100 days post auto-HSCT, the MRD status was assessed by means of bone marrow examination using six-color Flow Cytometry with a panel of antibodies to the following antigens: CD38, CD138, CD45, CD56, CD117, and CD19. Tests yielding less than 50 clonal plasma cells in 500,000 white blood cells (< 0.01 %, Limit of Detection: 10-4) were reported as an MRD-negative status. A stringent complete response after auto-HSCT had been achieved in 25 patients (48 %), while an MRD-positive status was detected in 27 subjects (52 %). At 100 days post auto-HSCT, MRD-negative patients were randomized into two arms: 14 subjects were given bortezomib MT (1.3 mg/m2 s.c., one dose every two weeks for one year), and 11 patients were not administered M\"; one female patient was subsequently withdrawn from maintenance therapy due to drug toxicity. Some of the MRD-positive subjects (19) received bortezomib MT according to the aforementioned regimen, while the others (8 patients) did not receive MT. The follow-up period from the time of MRD detection ranged from 5 months to 27 months (median 14 months). Two deaths (unrelated to the underlying condition) were registered in the course of the trial. Relapse-free survival (RFS) rate was selected as the efficacy endpoint for MM patients. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method and a log-rank test was used to compare the survival estimates between two groups. The compared groups were overall balanced for known prognostic factors. Statistical analysis was done using SAS 9.4. Results: MRD-positive patients were found to have a lower 2-year RFS rate compared with MRD-negative patients: 49 % vs 60 % (P=0.056); the presence of MRD increases the risk of relapse (Hazard Ratio: 1.7, 95 % CI: 1.3 \u2212 3.4) (Fig. 1). MT administered in MRD-negative patients did not increase their RFS: the 2-year RFS rates were found to be approximately the same in the MT and no MT arms (P=0.46), and equal to 84 % (Fig. 2). MT used in MRD-positive patients did increase their RFS: the 2-year RFS rate was higher in patients treated with MT compared with the no MT treated: 43 % vs 35 % (P=0.076) (Fig. 3). Following completion of MT, 8 out of 19 MRD-positive patients (42 %) achieved a better antitumour response, i. e. a stringent complete response. Conclusion: The reported study demonstrated that assessment of the MRD status provides an effective criterion for risk stratification in patients who have received auto-HSCT and are considered for MT. Maintenance therapy appears to be most appropriate in patients found to be MRD-positive after auto-HSCT, while for MRD-negative patients carrying out MT is inappropriate because it does not result in significant effect, but is associated with toxic complications.
