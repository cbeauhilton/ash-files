    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Teclistamab (Tec) is a B-cell maturation antigen \u00d7 CD3 T-cell redirecting bispecific antibody. In the phase 1 MajesTEC-1 trial in patients (pts) with heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), Tec monotherapy was well tolerated and yielded an overall response rate of 65% and very good partial response or better rate of 58% at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) with 6.1 months' median follow-up; responses were durable and deepened over time. Daratumumab (Dara) is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD38 and is approved for the treatment of MM. In addition to direct cytotoxicity, Dara has immunomodulatory effects, including promotion of T-cell expansion and depletion of suppressive CD38+ immunoregulatory cells, making it a rational partner for T-cell redirection. In preclinical studies, the lytic activity of Tec against MM cell lines was enhanced by pretreatment and combination treatment with Dara. By targeting discrete yet complementary antigens, combination of Tec and Dara may improve efficacy in pts with RRMM. We present data for pts with RRMM who received Tec + Dara in a phase 1b multicohort study (TRIMM-2; NCT04108195). Methods: Eligible pts were \u226518 years of age with an MM diagnosis and had received \u22653 prior lines of therapy (including a proteasome inhibitor [PI] and immunomodulatory drug [IMiD]) or were double refractory to a PI and IMiD. Pts who had received anti-CD38 therapy \u226490 days were excluded. In Tec + Dara cohorts, treatment was administered in 28-d cycles (with step-up dosing for Tec). The primary objectives were to identify the RP2D for the Tec + Dara combination and evaluate its safety. This analysis focuses on subcutaneous (SC) cohorts in the study. Responses were assessed by IMWG criteria and adverse events (AEs) by CTCAE v5.0, except for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), which were graded per ASTCT guidelines. Results: A total of 33 pts received SC Tec + Dara in different dosing cohorts: Dara 1800 mg + Tec 1500 \u00b5g/kg weekly (n=21), + Tec 3000 \u00b5g/kg weekly (n=5), + Tec 300 mg biweekly starting Cycle 3 Day 1 (Tec 150 mg weekly in Cycles 1-2; n=2), and + Tec 3000 \u00b5g/kg biweekly (n=5). Nine pts in the Dara 1800 mg + Tec 1500 \u00b5g/kg weekly cohort switched to Tec 3000 \u03bcg/kg biweekly dosing after Cycle 3 Day 1. As of the data cutoff (Jun 22, 2021), median follow-up across Tec + Dara cohorts was 3.6 months (range 0.1-10.4). Median pt age was 67 years (range 51-78) and 57.6% were female. Median number of lines of prior therapy was 5 (range 2-16); 69.7% of pts were triple-class exposed (prior anti-CD38 therapy was Dara in all 69.7%) and 60.6% were penta-drug exposed. Overall, 97.0% of pts had \u22651 AE of any grade; 66.7% had grade 3/4 AEs. The most common AE was CRS (54.5%; all grade 1/2); median time to onset was 2 days (range 1-6), and median duration was 2 days (range 1-7). Other AEs (\u226530% across Tec + Dara cohorts) were neutropenia (36.4%; all grade 3/4), thrombocytopenia (36.4%; grade 3/4 33.3%), anemia (36.4%; grade 3/4 24.2%), diarrhea (36.4%; grade 3/4 3.0%), nausea (30.3%; all grade 1/2), and pyrexia (30.3%; all grade 1/2). Infections occurred in 51.5% of pts (grade \u22653 24.2%). No ICANS events were reported. One pt in the Dara 1800 mg + Tec 3000 \u00b5g/kg weekly cohort died due to bacterial pneumonia (unrelated to treatment) during Cycle 1, and 1 in the Dara 1800 mg + Tec 1500 \u00b5g/kg weekly cohort died due to progressive disease. Responses in different dosing cohorts are shown in the Table. Across Tec + Dara cohorts, median time to first response was 1.0 month (range 0-1.9). Median duration of response was not reached. Tec + Dara treatment led to proinflammatory cytokine production (induction of interferon-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1) and T-cell activation (upregulation of programmed cell death protein-1 and CD38 on peripheral T cells). The Tec pharmacokinetic profile was similar to that in MajesTEC-1. Data will be updated with longer follow-up at the time of the congress. Conclusions: The combination of Tec + Dara had a manageable safety profile, consistent with the monotherapies, and showed preliminary efficacy in pretreated pts with MM; with longer follow-up, responses may continue to deepen, as has been seen with Tec monotherapy. These promising data warrant further investigation; the randomized phase 3 MajesTEC-3 study will evaluate Tec + Dara vs Dara, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone or Dara, bortezomib, and dexamethasone in pts with RRMM.
