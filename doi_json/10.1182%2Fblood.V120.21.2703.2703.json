The majority of cases are associated with an IgM isotype paraprotein, and when present, is termed Waldenstro\u0308m macroglobulinemia (WM). WM shows familial aggregation suggesting an inherited risk for disease, and also co-aggregates with CLL in families. In our previous work, we have shown that clonal populations of peripherally circulating B cells can be identified in 18% of unaffected family members from CLL kindreds. Most of these clonal populations have a typical CLL immunophenotype and have been termed CLL-like monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL). Because CLL and WM have related gene expression profiles and appear to have shared genetic risk, we hypothesized that unaffected family members of WM kindreds would have detectable circulating clonal B cell populations. Further, we undertook systematic flow cytometric screening of familial WM and IgM MGUS cases to determine the prevalence, immunphenotype, and biologic characteristics of circulating malignant B cells. Methods: A diagnosis of LPL / WM or IgM MGUS was determined using standard WHO criteria. All patients and unaffected family members were ascertained at the National Cancer Institute and provided informed consent. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated using density centrifugation and viably frozen in DMSO containing media. We developed a two tube, nine color flow cytometric assay: the first tube allowed for detection of CLL-like clones based upon co-expression of CD5, CD20, and CD23; the second tube targeted WM populations based upon expression on CD19, CD20, CD25, CD38, and surface IgM. Cell populations were considered clonally restricted if the \u03ba: \u03bb was > 3.0 or < 0.3. Clonal populations were then isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). RNA and genomic DNA were extracted for genetic and genomic studies using phenol: chloroform purification. Results: A total of 155 individuals were analyzed: 54 WM / LPL, 17 IgM MGUS, 1 IgG MGUS, 1 IgA MGUS, 1 NHL, and 81 unaffected family members. Twenty of 54 WM patients had detectable peripherally circulating populations. Thirteen WM patients had no detectable B cells, of these, 11 patients had prior treatment. As such, among the 41 WM patients with a B cell compartment that was analyzable by flow cytometry, 49% (20 of 41) had peripherally circulating B cell clones detected. Four of these 20 cases showed two immunophenotypically distinct clonal B cell populations. The immunophenotype was somewhat heterogenenous: 18 cases expressed surface IgM, CD38 was variable but expressed in most cases, CD25 was not detected in any case, and 4 cases showed a CLL like (CD5 + CD20 dim CD23 + ) immunophenotype. Interestingly, we detected peripherally circulating B cell clones in 9 of 17 cases (53%) of IgM MGUS, a proportion nearly identical to that identified in WM / LPL. Three of 9 were \u201cCLL-like\u201d with co-expression of CD5 and CD23, while the majority of clones were CD5 neg IgM + CD38 + . Among unaffected family members, we identified B cell clones in only 4 of 81 (5%). All 4 cases expressed CD5, and 3 showed a CLL-like phenotype, consistent with these individuals having MBL. Among all study subjects, 20 clonal B cell populations of > 10 4 B cells were FACS purified from 18 different cases: 12 WM, 4 IgM MGUS, 1 IgA MGUS, and 1 unaffected family member. Conclusions: Peripherally circulating B cell clones with an immunophenotype similar to that of LPL can be identified in approximately half of patients with WM / LPL. We observed for the first time that a similar proportion of patients with IgM MGUS have detectable clonal populations with an immunophenotype similar to that observed in WM patients. Genetic and genomic studies to determine the lineage of these populations are currently underway. The frequency of MBL among unaffected family members with WM is lower than that observed in CLL kindreds. CLL-like MBL can be detected at very low numbers because the cell population is immunophenotypically abnormal. The peripherally circulating clones identified in WM / LPL patients have an otherwise normal B cell immunophenotype and can only be detected by light chain restriction. This likely significantly limits the ability of flow cytometry to detect pre-clinical CD5 neg IgM expressing clonal populations. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
