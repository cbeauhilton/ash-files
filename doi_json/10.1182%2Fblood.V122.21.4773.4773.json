    "abstract_text": "Background Hereditary bleeding disorders (HBD) affect children from birth during their life course. Medical treatment and the overall prognosis of children with HBD have significantly progressed. But even in patients cared for in specialized treatment centers it remains unclear whether survival till adulthood goes along with health-related quality of life [Hr-QoL] comparable to other patients groups respectively comparable to population children. Therefore aim of the present study was to assess self- as well as parents/proxies reported Hr-QoL in children and adolescents with HBD and to compare the results with findings from children affected by another chronic medical condition respectively with healthy siblings and peers. Methods 91 patients with HBD (thrombosis / deep venous thrombosis, DVT, respectively Haemophilia A and B) aged 8 to 16 years from 6 Hemophilia study centers were investigated regarding Hr-QoL. Hr-QoL was assessed in patients and parents/proxies with the generic KINDL-R questionnaire exploring overall well-being and 6 sub-dimensions (physical well-being, psychological well-being, self-esteem, family-related well-being, friend-related well-being, and school-related well-being). Findings were compared with 70 children with stroke / TIA respectively with healthy controls (45 healthy siblings and 106 healthy peers). Results Overall well-being in children with thrombosis / DVT (77.6 \u00b1 9.7 points) was comparable to healthy controls but in children with Haemophilia A or B (76.0 \u00b1 9.6) lower compared with healthy peers (80.2 \u00b1 9.7, p = 0.005). No differences occurred between healthy controls and children with stroke/TIA (74.2 \u00b1 10.3). In children with HBD none of the KINDL-R sub-dimensions showed values below healthy siblings. Two KINDL-R sub-dimensions showed lower values compared with healthy peers. Parents/proxies rated the Hr-QoL of their children with HBD similar to their healthy children. The internal consistency of overall well-being in all study subgroups was acceptable (> 0.7) but showed poor results (< 0.5) in two KINDL-R sub-dimensions. Discussion The application of a generic Hr-QoL questionnaire in a sample of children and adults with HBD seems feasible. Their Hr-QoL seems comparable to their siblings but below their healthy peers.
