    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4032 Background: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a rare yet indolent disease. The median survival duration in CMML is 12 to 18 months and patients with poor prognostic features do even worse, with median survival time ranging 3 to 6 months. Activity with decitabine in CMML has been previously reported. We sought to analyze the clinical experience of 17 adults with a diagnosis of CMML treated on two decitabine studies. Methods: A subset of patients with CMML from a pivotal phase III 3-day dosing and an open-label trial of 5-day dosing were identified and reviewed to determine the overall response rate (ORR, based on IWG 2006 criteria), duration of response, time to response, and overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 17 patients with CMML were included in this review. Mean age at diagnosis was 71 years (range, 47 to 81 years) with a mean time from diagnosis of 406.4 days. The majority of CMML patients had de novo (94.1%), good risk cytogenetics (58.8%) with an IPSS classification of Intermediate-1 (64.7%). Baseline mean white blood count (WBC), hemoglobin (HGB), and platelets (plts) were 7.5 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bc L, 14.6 g/dL and 81.9 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bc L, respectively. A larger proportion of CMML patients at baseline were plt and RBC transfusion independent. Objective response rate (ORR) was 41% [17.6% complete response (CR) and 23.5% marrowCR (mCR)]; Hematologic improvement (HI) was observed in 11.7% and stable disease in 29.4% of patients. Median survival was 391 (95% CI 239, 678) days and 2 (11.7%) patients progressed to AML. The adverse event profile was similar to observations in previous trials with myelosuppression and infectious complications. Conclusions: This retrospective review of responses in CMML patients supports previous findings of decitabine experience in this population. In this analysis an overall response rate of 41.4% was achieved. Decitabine provided anti-CMML activity with an acceptable safety profile.
