    "abstract_text": "Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is among the largest and most complex of known viruses with 150\u2013200nm virions enclosing a double stranded 230kb DNA genome capable of coding for >200 proteins. HCMV infection is life-long, and for the vast majority of immune competent individuals clinically benign. Disease occurs almost exclusively in the setting of immune deficiency, suggesting that the stable host-parasite relationship that characterizes these infections is the result of an evolutionarily \u201cnegotiated\u201d balance between viral mechanisms of pathogenesis and the host immune response. In keeping with, and perhaps because of this balance, the human CD4+ T cell response to whole HCMV viral lysates is enormous, with median peripheral blood frequencies of HCMV-specific cells ~5\u201310 fold higher than for analogous preparations of other common viruses. Although certain HCMV ORFs have been identified as targets of either the CD4+ or CD8+ T cell response, the specificities comprising the CD4+ T cell response, and both the total frequencies and component parts of the CD8+ T cell response are unknown. Here, we used cytokine flow cytometry and ~14,000 overlapping 15mer peptides comprising all 213 HCMV ORFs encoding proteins >100 amino acids in length to precisely define the total CD4+ and CD8+ HCMV-specific T cell responses and the HCMV ORFs responsible for these responses in 33 HCMV-seropositive, HLA-disparate donors. An additional 9 HCMV seronegative donors were similarly examined to define the extent to which non-HCMV responses cross-react with HCMV-encoded epitopes. We found that when totaled, the median frequencies of HCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of the seropositive subjects were 4.0% and 4.5% for the total CD4+ or CD8+ T cell populations, respectively (which corresponds to 9.1% and 10.5% of the memory populations, respectively). The HCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses included a median 12 and 7 different ORFs, respectively, and all told, 73 HCMV ORFs were identified as targets for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, 26 ORFs as targets for CD8+ T cells alone, and 43 ORFS as targets for CD4+ T cells alone. UL55, UL83, UL86, UL99, and UL122 were the HCMV ORFs most commonly recognized by CD4+ T cells; UL123, UL83, UL48, UL122 and UL28 were the HCMV ORFs most commonly recognized by CD8+ T cells. The relationship between immunogenicity and 1) HLA haplotype and 2) ORF expression and function will be discussed. HCMV-seronegative individuals were non-reactive with the vast majority of HCMV peptides. Only 7 potentially cross-reactive responses were identified (all by CD8+ T cells) to 3 ORFs (US32, US29 and UL116) out of a total of almost 4,000 potential responses, suggesting fortuitous cross-reactivity with HCMV epitopes is uncommon. These data provide the first glimpse of the total human T cell response to a complex infectious agent, and will provide insight into the rules governing immunodominance and cross-reactivity in complex viral infections of humans.",
