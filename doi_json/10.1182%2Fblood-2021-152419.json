    "abstract_text": "Patients who relapse after allogeneic HCT have a poor prognosis and few effective treatment options. Responses to salvage therapy with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are driven by a graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect. However, relapses and moderate to severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) are common. Therapies that increase the GvL effect without inducing GVHD are needed. The NEXI-001 study is a prospective, multicenter, open-label phase 1/2 trial designed to characterize the safety, immunogenic, and antitumor activity of the NEXI-001 antigen specific T-cell product. This product is a donor-derived non-genetically engineered therapy that consists of populations of CD8+ T cells that recognize HLA 02.01-restricted peptides from the WT1, PRAME, and Cyclin A1 antigens. These T cells consist of populations with key memory phenotypes, including stem-like memory, central memory, and effector memory cells, with a low proportion (<5%) of potentially allogeneic-reactive T-na\u00efve cells. Patients enrolled into the first cohort of the dose escalation phase received a single infusion of 50 million (M) to 100M cells of the NEXI-001 product. Bridging anti-AML treatment was permitted during the manufacture of the cellular product with a wash-out period of at least 14 days prior to lymphodepletion (LD) chemotherapy (intravenous fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 ) that was administered on Days -5, -4, and -3 prior to the infusion of the NEXI-001 product up to 72 hours later (Day1). Lymphocyte recovery to baseline levels occurred as early as three days after the NEXI-001 product infusion with robust CD4 and CD8 T cell reconstitution after LD chemotherapy. NEXI-001 antigen specific T cells were detectable in peripheral blood (PB) by multimer staining and were found to proliferate over time and to traffic to bone marrow. The phenotype composition of detectable antigen specific T cells at both sites was that of the infused product. T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing assays revealed T cell clones in the NEXI-001 product that were not detected in PB of patients tested at baseline. These unique clones subsequently expanded in PB and bone marrow (BM) and persisted over time. Neutrophil recovery, decreased transfusion burden of platelets and red blood cells, and increased donor chimerism were observed. Decreases in myeloblasts and reduction in the size of an extramedullary myeloid sarcoma were suggestive of clinical activity. One patient, a 23-year- old with MRD+ disease at baseline, received two doses of 200M NEXI-001 cells separated by approximately 2 months. Following the first infusion, antigen specific CD8+ T cells increased gradually in PB to 9% of the total CD3+ T cell population just prior to the second infusion and were found to have trafficked to bone marrow. By Day 2 following the second infusion, which was not preceded by LD chemotherapy, the antigen specific CD8+ T cells again increased to 9% of the total CD3+ T cell population in PB and remained at \u22655% until the end of study visit a month later. The absolute lymphocyte count increased by 50% highlighting continued expansion of the NEXI-001 T cells. These cells also maintained significant Tscm populations. Treatment related adverse events, including infusion reactions, GVHD, CRS, and neurotoxicity (ICANS), have not developed in these patients who have received 50M to 200M T cells of the NEXI-001 product either as single or repeat infusions. In conclusion, these results show that infusion of the NEXI-001 product is safe and capable of generating a cell-mediated immune response with early signs of clinical activity. A second infusion is associated with increasing the level of antigen specific CD8+ T cells and their persistence in PB and BM. TCR sequencing and RNA Seq transcriptional profiling of the CD8+ T cells are planned, and these data will be available for presentation during the ASH conference. At least two cycles of 200M NEXI-001 cells weekly x 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle is planned for the next dose-escalation cohort. Early data suggest that the NEXI-001 product has the potential to enhance a GvL effect with minimal GVHD-associated toxicities.
