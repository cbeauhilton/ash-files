    "abstract_text": "Abstract 397 Nrf2 is a basic region-leucine-zipper transcription factor that regulates expression of numerous genes required for oxidative stress response, drug and toxin detoxification, protein ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation of damaged proteins. Therefore Nrf2 represents a major cellular defense mechanism against oxidative and toxic stresses. We have shown that CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) drawn from peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) autografts of lymphoma patients who develop therapy-related myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/AML) after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (aHCT) demonstrate significantly reduced expression of Nrf2-mediated stress response pathway genes compared to cells from patients who do not develop t-MDS/AML (Cancer Cell 20, 591\u2013605). We have extended these findings to study the role of Nrf2 in HSPC regulation and the response to genotoxic chemotherapeutic agents by using an Nrf2 knockout (KO) mouse model. Nrf2 KO mice demonstrated impaired bone marrow (BM) long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) function, manifested by significantly reduced competitive engraftment of BM cells in recipient mice at 16 weeks compared to wild-type (WT) controls (42.5\u00b12.8% vs. 57.2\u00b13.3% peripheral blood engraftment for KO and WT donors respectively, p<0.01). An even more significant defect in engraftment of KO cells was seen after transplantation to secondary recipients (16.4\u00b11.7% vs. 61.9\u00b11.5% peripheral blood engraftment at 8 weeks for KO and WT donors respectively, p<0.01). Nrf2 KO mice also demonstrated increased sensitivity to ENU treatment compared to WT mice. ENU (100mg/kg) treatment resulted in severe anemia at 7 months in 100% of KO mice compared with 36% of WT mice (p<0.001). Furthermore, anemia developed at a median of 5 months in Nrf2 KO mice compared to 10 months in WT controls. Pathological examination of BM from anemic mice revealed reduced erythropoiesis with impaired erythroid maturation and expansion of myeloid cells, consistent with myeloid dysplasia. Q-RT-PCR analysis demonstrated significantly reduced expression of Nrf2 target genes, including Hmo-1, Nqo-1, Gclc and Gpx1, in BM c-kit+ HSPC from KO mice compared to WT mice (p<0.05). Interestingly, expression of several P53 target genes including Bax, Puma, Cdkn1a and Necdin were also significantly reduced in BM c-kit+ cells from Nrf2 KO compared to WT mice. We also observed reduced P53 target gene expression in Nrf2 KO c-Kit cells compared with WT cells 4 hours after treatment with ENU (p<0.05), indicating impaired P53 response in Nrf2 deficient HSPC. To examine the P53 response to DNA damaging agents in LT-HSC, we exposed Nrf2 KO and WT mice to 2Gy irradiation and selected BM LT-HSC (Lin-Sca-1+c-kit+Flt-3-CD150+CD48-) using flow cytometry 12 hours after irradiation. Q-RT-PCR analysis showed significantly reduced expression of P53 target genes Bax, Puma and Necdin (p<0.05), and a trend towards reduced expression of Cdkn1a (p=0.08), in Nrf2 KO compared to WT LT-HSC. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed significantly reduced nuclear and increased cytoplasmic localization of P53 in Nrf2 KO compared to WT LT-HSC. Western blotting analysis showed increased levels of ubquitinated proteins in BM c-kit+ HSPC from Nrf2 KO compared to WT mice, and immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting for P53 revealed increased high molecular weight bands indicative of ubiquitinated P53 in Nrf2 KO HSPC. Nrf2 is a key regulator of protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and these results suggest that abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation of ubiquitinated P53 may contribute to altered P53 function in Nrf2 deficient HSPC. In conclusion, our results show that Nrf2 deficiency results in impaired HSC self-renewal capacity under physiological conditions, and significantly increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress, potentially explained by altered P53 protein modulation in Nrf2 deficient HSPC. These observations suggest that Nrf2 deficiency could contribute to development of t-MDS/AML following exposure to genotoxic agents, and support further evaluation of Nrf2 as a potential target of chemopreventive efforts.
