    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4633 Background: Golgins are proteins of the Golgi complex. Several Golgins have been implicated in apoptosis. Expression of Golgin-84, a Golgin protein, is altered in apoptotic WEHI-231, a B-cell lymphoma line, suggesting that Golgin-84 may play a role in lymphoid tumorigenesis. Here, we aimed to determine the expression levels of Golgin-84 in human primary non-Hodgkin lymphomas and plasma cell myeloma. Design: Golgin-84 expression was investigated in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines by using Western blot analysis and polyclonal antibodies. Using immunohistochemical stains, Western blotting analysis and Q-PCR, Golgin-84 expression was assessed in 5 reactive lymph nodes, 149 cases of primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 28 cases of primary plasma cell myeloma. Results: Immunohistochemical stains, Western blotting analysis and Q-PCR on 5 reactive lymph nodes demonstrated that Golgin-84 was expressed at low levels in lymphoid cells of germinal centers, mantle cells, marginal zones, and interfollicular areas. Golgin-84 was variably expressed in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines tested, with the highest levels in cells from high-grade tumors (e.g. anaplastic large cell lymphoma; ALCL, Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), ALCL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified (PTCL)) and the lowest levels in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells. DLBCL, ALCL and PTCL frequently showed high expression of Golgin-84. Most lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas (LPL) and plasma cell myeloma (PCM) expressed high levels of Golgin-84. Expression levels of Golgin-84 were lower in MCL and low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). Conclusions: Golgin-84 expression levels are low in lymphoid cells of normal lymph nodes. Most (>90%) cases of LPL and PCM, and at least half of cases of DLBCL, ALCL and PTCL express high levels of Golgin-84. These findings suggest that Golgin-84 may be involved in tumorigenesis or lymphoma progression, particularly in neoplasms with plasmacytic differentiation.
