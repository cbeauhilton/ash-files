    "abstract_text": "Bendamustine was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2008 for the treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Corticosteroids have been administered in regimens with chemotherapy for CLL for more than 40 years. Despite this, the combination of Bendamustine and Methylprednisolone has not been explored in CLL. We describe our experience with Bendamustine 100 mg/m2 and Methylprednisolone 125 mg IV on days 1 and 2 and Peg-filgastrim 6 mg subcutaneously on day 3 every 28 days for 3-4 cycles in 12 patients with CLL. Cycles have been limited to attempt to prevent cumulative marrow toxicity due to Bendamustine. Patient characteristics: 7 males/5 females, median age-58, Binet stage B (8), C (2), A (2); ZAP70/CD38+ (5), Trisomy 12 (3), 13q- (2), normal cytogenetics (2); median ECOG status 1, no prior therapy in 8. Median number of cycles received = 3 (two received 4 cycles). Most common toxicities: nausea/emesis (5), fever/flu-like symptoms (4), arthralgia/myalgia (4). There have been no treatment-related deaths. One patient was briefly hospitalized for pneumonia. Complete responses have been seen in 6 patients (median duration = 50.7 months; range: 12.1+ to 87.3 months). Partial responses have been seen in 4 patients (median duration = 17.3+ months; range: 3.3 to 26.9+ months). The combination of Bendamustine and Methylprednisolone given in a limited schedule is well-tolerated and is active in CLL. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
