    "abstract_text": "Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an (K63) E3-ligase, plays a crucial role in many biological processes and its activity is relevant in the biology of multiple cancers including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Although molecules that trigger TRAF6 activation have been defined, those that stabilize TRAF6 levels and/or enhance TRAF6 function remain largely unclear. Previously, we found that activation of smoothened (SMO) with recombinant Hedgehog (Hh) ligand increased the binding between SMO with TRAF6, as well as TRAF6 protein levels (Blood 2013; 121:4718-28). In addition, transient overexpression of SMO resulted in increased K63-Ub of both TRAF6 and NEMO indicating stabilization of these proteins resulting in NF-kB activation. This is relevant, as more recently we found that TRAF6 amplifies pAKT signaling in DLBCL and that TRAF6 is the dominant E3 ligase for the K63-Ub of AKT in DLBCL. Moreover, TRAF6 recruitment to the cell membrane, and stabilization of its ubiquitination profile are facilitated by SMO. SMO is a member of the Frizzled-class G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) and is traditionally known for its role as signal transducer in canonical Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. These observations prompted us to investigate whether the ability of SMO to increase TRAF6 levels is limited to ligand induced signaling, whether it contributes to chemoresistance in DLBCL cells, and whether SMO directly participates in controlling TRAF6 levels. To confirm the regulatory role of SMO in the TRAF6/AKT axis in DLBCL cells (HBL1 and HT) and further outline the nature of the underlying regulation, we measured the impact of activation of the Hh pathway with recombinant Shh ligand on TRAF6 levels, with and without SMO knockdown or recombinant SMO overexpression. Canonical Hh signaling results in the activation of the GLI1 transcription factor and the subsequent elevation of GLI1 mRNA levels is an established indicator of activation of the Hh pathway. However, neither SMO activation nor the knockdown of GLI1 had a significant impact on TRAF6 mRNA levels. These findings indicate that TRAF6 is not transcriptionally regulated by SMO signaling through GLI1 (canonical Hh signaling). In contrast, overexpression of SMO or siRNA knockdown of SMO resulted in an increase or decrease of TRAF6 protein levels, respectively. Consistent with the decrease of AKT activation (pAKT T308 and S473) after TRAF6 knockdown, the increase in TRAF6 levels that follows SMO overexpression resulted in an increase in the levels of AKT phosphorylation. Altogether, these observations suggest a post-translational regulation of TRAF6 by SMO. Indeed, stable knockdown of SMO dramatically reduces the half-life of TRAF6 in both HBL1 and HT cells in the presence of cyclohexamide. Furthermore, overexpression of SMO increases K63-Ub of both TRAF6 and AKT. In contrast, the SMO induced decrease in K48-Ub occurred only for TRAF6 but not for AKT. These data link the SMO-stimulated activation of TRAF6 to the enhancement of AKT signaling and protection of TRAF6 from proteasomal degradation. Mechanistically, we found that SMO, through its C-terminal tail, stabilizes TRAF6 and protects TRAF6 from proteosomal degradation, an effect mediated by ubiquitin-specific protease-8 (USP8). Importantly, this functional link between SMO and TRAF6 is reflected in DLBCL patient samples where high expression of both molecules correlates with poor prognosis. Resistance to DXR is a serious challenge in the treatment of DLBCL, and activated AKT is known to contribute to DXR resistance in multiple cancers including DLBCL. We evaluated whether SMO and TRAF6 support resistance to DXR in DLBCL cell lines. We exposed HT and HBL1 cells as well as their counterparts with stable knockdown of TRAF6 or SMO to DXR for 96hrs. Cell viability after exposure to DXR was determined by an Annexin V and PI staining assay. Silencing SMO or TRAF6 dramatically decreased cell survival after treatment with DXR. In summary, we report that SMO is needed to facilitate and maintain TRAF6-dependent elevated pAKT levels in DLBCL cell lines of germinal (GC) and non-GC subtypes, and that the SMO/TRAF6 axis contributes to DXR resistance in DLBCL. Our study reveals a novel and potential central cell survival signaling mechanism in which SMO stabilizes and protects TRAF6 from proteosomal degradation.
