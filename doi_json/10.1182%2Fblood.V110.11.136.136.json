    "abstract_text": "cPLA2 catalyzes the release of arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of platelet membrane glycerophospholipids, leading via cyclooxygenase to the production of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a platelet agonist. One function of TXA2 and other platelet agonists is to activate the fibrinogen-binding function of integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 through a series of biochemical steps known as inside-out signaling. While some platelet agonists stimulate cPLA2 activity and TXA2 production during inside-out signaling, others appear to require fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and subsequent outside-in signaling through the integrin to elicit TXA2 production. However, the precise relationship between cPLA2 and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is unclear. Here we have discovered that cPLA2\u03b1, the principal cPLA2 isoform in platelets, interacts with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and participates in both inside-out and outside-in integrin signaling. A pool of cPLA2\u03b1 was constitutively associated with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in human and murine platelets, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation with antibodies to cPLA2\u03b1 or \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Although the mode of interaction of cPLA2\u03b1 with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is unknown, vimentin, an intermediate filament protein known to bind to cPLA2\u03b1 and integrin \u03b2 tails, co-immunoprecipitated with both cPLA2 and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 from platelets. Selective induction of fibrinogen binding to platelets by MnCl 2 caused a detectable increase in cPLA2 activity in both whole platelet extracts and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 immunoprecipitates. However, this response was not observed in platelets from mice deficient in cPLA2\u03b1 or in human platelets pre-treated with pyrrophenone, a selective cPLA2\u03b1 inhibitor. Integrin-dependent activation of cPLA2\u03b1 had functional consequences. First, thromboxane A2 produced in response to fibrinogen binding to \u03b1IIb\u03b23 was required for the recruitment of activated protein kinase C\u03b2 to the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 signaling complex, an event known to be required for cytoskeletal reorganization and full platelet spreading on fibrinogen. Second, platelets from cPLA2\u03b1-deficient mice exhibited reduced spreading on fibrinogen compared to platelets from wild-type littermate controls (P < 0.05). Similarly, human platelets pre-treated with either pyrrophenone or a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist spread poorly on fibrinogen compared to vehicle-treated control platelets (P < 0.05). Third, cPLA2\u03b1-deficient platelets stimulated by the GP VI collagen receptor agonist, CRP, exhibited decreased binding of soluble fibrinogen (P < 0.05). These studies establish that cPLA2\u03b1 can function in association with \u03b1IIb\u03b23 to produce a pool of TXA2 that promotes integrin-dependent activation of protein kinase C\u03b2, cytoskeletal reorganization and platelet spreading. Given the previous demonstration of prolonged bleeding times and protection from thromboembolism in cPLA2\u03b1-deficient mice, these results imply that normal platelet function requires cPLA2\u03b1 activation both upstream and downstream of \u03b1IIb\u03b23."
