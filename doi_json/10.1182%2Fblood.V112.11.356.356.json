    "abstract_text": "The host microenvironment is important for proliferation and survival of leukemic cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Numerous molecules, signaling pathways and cell types have been reported to enhance CLL cell survival. To date, most reports on such interactions are derived from in-vitro studies, where each study focused on a specific ligand/receptor interaction or candidate pathway. Here, we adopted a more global approach to evaluate in-vivo effects of the microenvironment on leukemic cell biology. CLL cells from 15 patients were obtained on the same day from 3 different compartments: peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM) and lymph node (LN), from which a single cell suspension was prepared. Tumor cells from all three compartments were purified by CD19 selection to purity >98%. Patients were assigned to prognostic subtypes based on immunoglobulin sequencing (Ig) and ZAP70 expression: 10 patients had the more progressive subtype (Ig-unmutated, ZAP70+) and 5 patients belonged to the more indolent subtype. Cells were analyzed for surface markers by flow cytometry and by gene expression profiling on Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. By flow cytometry, CLL cells in LN expressed higher levels of activation markers including CD69 and CD38 compared to CLL cells in PB (% CD19+/69+; 71 \u00b127 vs. 35 \u00b128, p2, FDR <0.2). A large number of these genes encode proteins important for cell cycle control and proliferation: different cyclins, PCNA, Ki67, TOP2A and MYC. We also detected a significant increase in the expression of NF-\u03baB target genes in LN resident tumor cells, including CD83, CD69, JunB, Cyclin D2, GADD45B, CCL3, CCL4 and others. Consistent with activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway in LN, I\u03baB-beta protein levels in tumor cells from LN were lower than levels in matching PB cells. Next we identified genes differentially expressed between CLL subtypes based on Ig-mutation status separately for each of the 3 compartments. Interestingly, these subtype identifying gene sets were only partially overlapping. In Ig-unmutated, ZAP70+ cells several genes were more strongly regulated by the microenvironment then in Ig-mutated, ZAP70 negative cells. Among these genes is LPL, which has been reported to distinguish the CLL subtypes, and other genes induced by B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Using in-vitro IgM activation, we show that these genes are indeed induced by BCR stimulation but not by CD40 ligation and that their induction is confined to ZAP70+ CLL cells. In conclusion: interactions between CLL cells and elements of the microenvironment in LN induce cell proliferation and NF-\u03baB activation. The preferential upregulation of BCR regulated genes in ZAP70+ CLL demonstrates a more efficient in-vivo response of ZAP-70+ cells to BCR stimulation. Our results highlight the importance of NF\u03ba \u03baB and BCR signaling in CLL and provide a rationale to focus treatment approaches on these central pathways.",
