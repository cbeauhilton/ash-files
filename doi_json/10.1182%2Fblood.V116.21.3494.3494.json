    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3494 Introduction: Treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) patients (<65 yrs) consists of induction chemotherapy for 3\u20136 months followed by peripheral blood stem cell collection and transplantation. Both high dose cyclophosphamide (HD-C, 2 gr/m 2 /day, on days 1\u20132) and lower dosage of cyclophosphamide (1 gr/m 2 /i.v.on day 1) combined with doxorubicin (15 mg/m 2 /day, on days 1\u20134) and dexamethason 40 mg orally, days 1\u20134 (LD-C) are used, in combination with G-CSF, to mobilize hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. A great variability was observed in the engraftment of different hematopoietic lineages post-ASCT. Therefore we questioned whether the dose of cyclofosfamide as mobilizing agent might affect the neutrophil and platelet recovery post-ASCT. The studied MM patients were treated with VAD or TAD (Blood 2010;11:115). Peripheral blood stem cells were collected after LD-C and HD-C with the Cobe Spectra; in each collection, 10 \u2013 12 L of blood was processed in 3 \u2013 4 hours. The target yield was 10 \u00d7 10 6 /kg CD34 + cells. Results: 92 patients were treated according to VAD and 41 patients with TAD. In the VAD arm 89% of the patients reached the target yield of CD34 + cells after 1 collection compared to 61% in patients treated with TAD (p = 0.0003). The number of CD34 + cells collected at the first day and the total CD34 yield after HD-C or LD-C was significantly higher in patients treated with VAD compared with TAD: 16.6 \u00b1 11.6 \u00d7 10 6 /kg vs. 10.4 \u00b1 9.3 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (p=0.003), and 16.9 \u00b1 11.1 \u00d7 10 6 /kg vs 12.3 \u00b1 8.6 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (p=0.02). No significant difference was observed in the total yield of collected CD34 + cells in the VAD arm or TAD arm between HD-C vs. LD-C. In all patients high dose melphalan (200 mg/m 2 ) was used as conditioning regimen followed by reinfusion of peripheral blood stem cells. In the VAD arm no difference in neutrophil and platelet engraftment (absolute neutrophil count > 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L and platelet count > 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L without platelet transfusions) was noticed between patients mobilized with LD-C (22 \u00b112 days and 23 \u00b113 days) or HD-C (18 \u00b1 5 (p=0.1) and 21 \u00b111 days (p=0.5)); in contrast a significant difference was demonstrated in neutrophil and platelet engraftment between patients treated according the TAD arm and mobilized with LD-C (20 \u00b1 8 days and 20 \u00b119 days) or HD-C (34 \u00b1 11 days (p<0.0001) and 43 \u00b122 days (p=0.001)). These differences could not be ascribed to differences in the number of infused CD34 + cells: VAD arm: LD-C: 5.7 \u00b1 2.6 \u00d7 10 6 /kg, HD-C: 5.7 \u00b1 2.5 \u00d7 10 6 /kg: TAD arm: LD-C: 5.2 \u00b1 2.5 \u00d7 10 6 /kg and TAD-HD-C 6.4 \u00b1 2 \u00d7 10 6 /kg. It might be assumed that the higher dosage of cyclophosphamide had a positive effect on tumor response. However the impaired engraftment was not associated with differences in relapse free survival between the different arms (p = 0.2). In summary these data demonstrate that thalidomide containing regimen in MM patients impair mobilization of stem/progenitor cells and that a mobilization with high dose cyclophosphamide and not low dose cyclophosphamide after treatment with thalidomide prolong the engraftment post-transplantation.
