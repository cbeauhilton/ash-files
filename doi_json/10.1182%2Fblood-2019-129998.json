    "abstract_text": "Background The Natural Killer Group 2D (NKG2D) receptor is a NK cell activating receptor that binds to eight different ligands (NKG2DL) commonly over-expressed in cancer, including MICA and MICB. The product candidate CYAD-01 are chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells encoding the full length human NKG2D fused to the intracellular domain of CD3\u03b6. Data from preclinical models have shown that CYAD-01 cells specifically target solid and hematological tumors. Encouraging preliminary results from the Phase I clinical trial THINK, assessing CYAD-01 safety, showed initial signals of objective clinical responses in patients with r/r AML and MDS. The clinical development of CAR T-cells has been limited by several challenges including achieving sufficient numbers of cells for clinical application. We have previously shown that NKG2D ligands are transiently expressed on activated T cells and that robust cell yields are generated through the addition of a blocking antibody and a PI3K inhibitor during cell manufacture. Here, we investigated the ability of an optimized short hairpin RNA (shRNA) technology to modulate NKG2DL expression on CYAD-01 cells and to determine if there is an increase in the anti-tumor activity of NKG2D-based CAR T-cells (termed CYAD-02). Methods Molecular and cellular analyses identified MICA and MICB as the key NKG2DL expressed on activated T-cells and highly likely to participate in driving fratricide. In silico analysis and in vitro screening allowed the identification of a single shRNA targeting the conserved regions of MICA and MICB, thus downregulating both MICA and MICB expression. The selected shRNA was incorporated in the NKG2D-based CAR vector, creating the next-generation NKG2D-based CAR T-cell candidate, CYAD-02. In addition, truncated versions of the NKG2D receptor were generated to explore the mechanisms of action of NKG2D receptor activity in vivo . The in vivo persistence and anti-tumor activity of CYAD-02 cells was evaluated in an aggressive preclinical model of AML. Results Injection of CAR T-cells bearing truncated forms of the NKG2D-CAR in immunosuppressed mice resulted in similar persistence to the control T-cells. In contrast, CYAD-01 cells had reduced persistence, suggesting that the recognition of the NKG2DL by the NKG2D receptor could contribute to this effect. Analysis of cell phenotype upon CAR T-cell activation showed that MICA and MICB were transiently expressed on T-cells during manufacturing. These results collectively suggested that downregulating MICA and MICB expression in CYAD-01 cells could be a mean to increase CAR T-cell persistence in vivo . Candidate shRNA were screened for efficient targeting of both MICA and MICB at the mRNA and protein level. T-cells transduced with a single vector encoding for the NKG2D-based CAR and the selected shRNA targeting MICA and MICB (CYAD-02) demonstrated 3-fold increased expansion during in vitro culture in the absence of the blocking antibody used to increase cell yield during manufacture. When injected into immunosuppressed mice, CYAD-02 cells generated with the Optimab process showed 10-fold higher engraftment one week after injection and potent anti-tumor activity resulting in 2.6-fold increase of mouse survival in an aggressive AML model. Conclusions By using a single vector encoding the NKG2D-based CAR next to a shRNA targeting MICA and MICB and combined with improved cell culture methods, CYAD-02, the next-generation of NKG2D-based CAR T-cells, demonstrated enhanced in vivo persistence and anti-tumor activity. Following FDA acceptance of the IND application, a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial evaluating the safety and clinical activity of CYAD-02 for the treatment of r/r AML and MDS is scheduled to start in early 2020.
