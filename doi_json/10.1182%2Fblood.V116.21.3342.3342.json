This policy has generated controversy, especially amongst student populations, due its perceived discrimination against homosexual men. Objectives: 1) To determine the acceptability of a behaviour-based donor health questionnaire amongst Canadian university students and assess its suitability as an alternative to the current MSM policy. 2) To determine the perception of blood safety associated with specific risk behaviours. Methods: We conducted a survey amongst students at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, Canada. A questionnaire was designed that included questions found on the current CBS donor health survey, and behaviour-based questions derived from studies assessing high risk factors for HIV. For each question, participants were asked to rate its acceptability and its perceived effect on blood safety using 7-point Likert scales. They were also asked whether the question would deter them from future donations. Data was analyzed using non-parametric tests. Results: 741/3500 (21.2%) students participated in the study. Students rated both current and behavioural questions as equally acceptable and the majority (89-97%) would not be deterred from donating blood in the future by any question. The response scores for both sets of questions were significantly correlated. Questions on donor's sexual practices were rated less acceptable compared to those on high risk behaviours. Sexually transmitted infections, injection drug use and sex for money were considered high risk behaviours for blood safety (69-95% unsafe). In contrast, sexual practices (MSM, anal intercourse, condom use, knowledge of partner's sexual background) were rated less important for blood safety (30 to 62% unsafe). We found an inverse correlation between the perception of safety and the acceptability of questions ( Table ). 24.4% of students rated both questions on MSM status and a behaviour-based alternative as equally unacceptable.

View Large Discussion: A behaviour-based screening modification is unlikely to change opinions or satisfy those who object the current MSM policy. Acceptability of these questions might be related to a poor understanding of the effect of sexual practices on blood supply safety. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
