    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3733 Human G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood (mPB) progenitor harvests collected by leukapheresis have become the usual transplant of choice when a suitable normal histocompatible or unrelated adult donor is available for patients requiring a transplant. Unfortunately, for most such patients such a donor is not available and, for these individuals, an autotransplant or unrelated cord blood (CB) unit provide potential alternatives. Autologous harvests are frequently compromised by prior exposure to chemotherapy, and the relatively small size of a single CB unit, can also pose significant problems, particularly in adult recipients. These typically involve pronounced delays in neutrophil recovery and almost always a protracted and/or poor recovery in platelet output. Interestingly, although the simultaneous transplantation of multiple CB units has successfully reduced graft failure, timely hematopoietic recovery is still not commonly achieved, especially for the platelets. There is thus a compelling need to understand the types of repopulating cells that are present in different mPB and CB harvests and how these may vary numerically and biologically. Such information is key to devising better surrogate predictors of adequate engrafting potential and as a first step towards developing new approaches to improve the utility of CB and poor mPB harvests for clinical transplant applications. To pursue these issues, we have developed new assays for quantifying different types of human cells with different durabilities of platelet and granulocyte generating activity in sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID-IL-2R\u03b3c \u2212/\u2212 (NSG) mice and have now used these assays to compare the numbers and output properties of different phenotypically characterized subpopulations of cells present in CB and normal mPB samples. Consistent with previous reports, we found that >90% of the week-3 bone marrow repopulating activity in transplanted mice was contained within the Lin \u2212 ALDH + fraction regardless of the source of the human cells tested. However, a substantial proportion of early (week 2) platelet repopulating activity came from the Lin \u2212 ALDH \u2212 fraction of both CB and mPB (30% for CB and 61% for mPB, decreasing to 12% and 16% respectively by week 3). In vitro CFU-Mk (and CFU-GM/BFU-E/CFU-GEMM) assays reflected a similar differential distribution between the Lin \u2212 ALDH + and Lin \u2212 ALDH \u2212 cells from the two sources, suggesting possible overlap in the corresponding in vitro and in vivo endpoints. Interestingly, at 3 weeks post-transplant, we found the Lin \u2212 ALDH + cells from mPB produced more of the GM cells than the platelets as compared to the Lin \u2212 ALDH + cells from CB. Limiting dilution assays revealed that the actual frequency of week-3 GM-repopulating cells (GMRC-3wks) and platelet-repopulating cells (PRC-3wks) in Lin \u2212 ALDH + cells in mPB (1/2500, 95% CI=1/1500\u20131/4200 and 1/3300, 95% CI=1/1900\u20131/5600) is actually about 3-fold lower (p3 weeks). In addition, our results demonstrate that the 3-week RCs in mPB and CB differ in their average clonal outputs of mature GM cells and platelets in vivo, suggesting ontogeny-related changes in the mechanisms that determine this functional parameter.
