    "abstract_text": "High throughput sequencing is a revolutionary technology for the definition of the genomic features of tumors. This talk will provide a review of the relevant methodologies for non-experts in the field. The presentation will include a discussion of how high throughput sequencing is performed, its relative strengths and weaknesses, and how it is applicable to formalin-fixed and fresh/frozen tissue samples. The talk will also describe future directions in the genomic analysis of tumors. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
