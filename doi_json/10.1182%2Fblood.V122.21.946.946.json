    "abstract_text": "Erythropoietin is required for erythroid progenitor cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. Increasing evidence suggests that erythropoietin treatment in mice can stimulate erythropoiesis and also affect metabolic processes in a dose dependent manner. For example, medium to high dose erythropoietin treatment (600 U/kg or 3000 U/kg) in leptin deficient obese (ob/ob) mice three times a week for three weeks or more results in the expected increase in hematocrit as well as decrease in accumulated body fat and improved glucose tolerance. Phlebotomy to maintain normal hematocrit demonstrated that erythropoietin regulation of body weight was not dependent on increased red cell mass. In non-obese wild type C57BL/6 mice, erythropoietin treatment also demonstrated the expected increase in hematocrit as well as a 15% reduction in body weight and decreased fasting blood glucose. Erythropoietin receptor is expressed at the highest level in erythroid progenitor cells. The link between increased metabolism and erythropoietin stimulated erythroid differentiation was suggested by the increased oxygen consumption rate observed in vitro in primary cultures of erythropoietin stimulated erythroid progenitor cells. Erythropoietin also stimulated glucose uptake in differentiating erythroid progenitor cells in a dose dependent manner. Glucose uptake decreased with the down regulation of erythropoietin receptor during terminal differentiation. Relatively high erythropoietin receptor expression and erythropoietin activity that may also contribute to erythropoietin metabolic activity has been observed in non-hematopoietic mouse tissue including the hypothalamus and white adipose tissue (Teng R, Gavrilova O et al., Nat Commun 2011). The hypothalamus contributes importantly to appetite regulation and mice treated with erythropoietin exhibited a decrease in food intake compared with saline control. We found that pair-feeding decreased body weight and fat mass, and improved glucose tolerance, but no more than half that observed with erythropoietin treatment, providing evidence that erythropoietin regulation of food intake accounts for only part of the metabolic response observed with erythropoietin treatment. Adipocytes isolated from white adipose tissue in erythropoietin treated mice showed an increase in oxygen consumption compared with vehicle treated or pair-fed mice. To assess the role of direct erythropoietin response of white adipose tissue in regulation of fat mass accumulation, we engineered mice with targeted deletion of erythropoietin receptor in adipose tissue. Erythropoietin treatment gave rise to the expected increase in hematocrit but resulted in a reduced decrease in body weight compared with saline treatment. These data show that erythropoietin treatment can stimulate cell oxygen consumption and can contribute to regulation of metabolism and body weight in mice. Erythropoietin receptor expression on erythroid progenitor cells provides for erythropoietin response to promote erythropoiesis and increase cell metabolic activity including glucose uptake and oxygen consumption. In non-hematopoietic tissue, erythropoietin receptor expression further contributes to erythropoietin regulated metabolic activity such as control of food intake attributed in part to hypothalamus response and modulation of fat mass affected by direct erythropoietin response in white adipose tissue. Therefore, in addition to its critical role in promoting erythropoiesis, erythropoietin can contribute to metabolic homeostasis via its activity in erythroid tissue and beyond.
