    "abstract_text": "Background. Patients with thalassemia, sickle-cell disease (SCD), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) receiving frequent transfusions require chelation therapy to prevent complications of iron overload. Deferoxamine (DFO) is an effective iron chelator that has been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with transfusional hemosiderosis. Data on the utilization and costs of DFO treatment are limited however. The objective of this study was to document the utilization and costs of DFO therapy in patients with transfusion-dependent anemias seen in typical clinical practice. Methods. Retrospective, observational study using data from large health insurance claims database spanning 1/97\u201312/04 (\u201cstudy period\u201d) and representing approximately 40 million members enrolled in >70 health plans across the US. Study subjects included members meeting the following criteria: \u22651 claims with diagnosis of thalassemia (282.4x), SCD (282.6x ), or MDS (ICD-9-CM 238.7x); \u22658 claims (on different days) for a transfusion of whole blood or red cells; \u22652 claims (on different days) for DFO. Follow-up was defined as the period from the date of first DFO claim (\u201cindex date\u201d) to end of study period, disenrollment, or 15 days after last claim for DFO, whichever occurred first. Outcomes included the number of claims for DFO and grams of DFO dispensed and the costs of DFO therapy, including costs of drug acquisition and administration. Outcomes were analyzed by qualifying diagnosis, numbers of transfusions received, and grams of DFO dispensed. Results. We identified 155 subjects who met all inclusion criteria, including 35 with thalassemia, 68 with SCD, and 52 with MDS. On average, patients received one transfusion every 3.4 weeks of follow-up. Mean DFO grams dispensed were 306 per year. MDS patients received the most transfusions but the least DFO. Only 38% of MDS patients received \u22653 g of DFO per week (\u2265156 g per year). Mean total DFO costs were $18,025 annually ($10,217 for drug and $7,808 for administration). Controlling for other factors, utilization of DFO was not associated with number of transfusions received; administration costs were only weakly associated with amount of DFO received.  .

Costs of DFO administration were high, representing approximately 43% of the total cost of chelation.",
