The once-daily oral iron chelator deferasirox (Exjade \u00ae ) maintains or reduces body iron in patients with MDS, however, it has not previously been assessed based on chelation history. This analysis therefore evaluates the efficacy and safety of deferasirox in a large population of chelation-nai\u0308ve and previously chelated patients with MDS. Methods This analysis is based on data from iron overloaded MDS patients aged \u22652 years who were enrolled in the 1-year multicenter EPIC study; patients with a life expectancy <1 year were excluded. Patients initially received deferasirox 10\u201330 mg/kg/day, depending on the frequency of blood transfusions; 5\u201310 mg/kg/day dose adjustments (range 0\u201340 mg/kg/day) were made based on 3-month serum ferritin trends and safety markers. Efficacy was assessed by monthly measurement of serum ferritin. Safety assessments included adverse event (AE) and laboratory parameter monitoring. Results In total, 341 MDS patients were enrolled; 165 (48.4%) were chelation-nai\u0308ve, 176 (51.6%) previously chelated with deferoxamine and/or deferiprone. Overall, 326 patients (95.6%) were aged \u226550 years. Baseline demographics, including median serum ferritin levels, were comparable between the two cohorts. Median serum ferritin decreased significantly in the overall population from baseline to month 12 ( P =0.002; Figure). Serum ferritin levels also decreased in chelation-nai\u0308ve ( P =0.004) and in previously chelated ( P =0.19) patients; median change was not significantly different between the two cohorts ( P =0.107). Chelation-nai\u0308ve and previously chelated patients who had a relatively low mean iron intake and baseline iron burden achieved a median reduction in serum ferritin with an average actual dose of 33% above baseline and >ULN; there were no progressive increases. One chelation-nai\u0308ve patient (0.3%) who had normal baseline alanine aminotransferase levels had an increase >10 \u00d7 ULN on two consecutive visits. Conclusions Although baseline serum ferritin levels were >2500 ng/mL, almost 50% of patients were chelation-naive, suggesting that the importance to treat iron overload continues to be underestimated in the MDS population. For previously chelated patients these data suggest that iron burden was not adequately managed with previous regimens. Irrespective of chelation history, with appropriate dosing based on transfusion requirements, serum ferritin levels and safety markers, deferasirox effectively decreased serum ferritin to <2500 ng/mL and had a manageable safety profile in MDS patients. These data highlight the need to monitor iron load in MDS and initiate effective chelation therapy to reduce body iron burden.
