    "abstract_text": "The Raf/MEK/ERK signaling module plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Our group, among others, has recently demonstrated that this pathway is frequently dysregulated in hematological malignancies and may constitute an attractive therapeutic target, particularly in AML. Here we investigated the effects of PD0325901, a novel MEK inhibitor, on phospho-protein expression, gene expression profiles, cell proliferation, and apoptosis in cell line models of AML, ALL, multiple myeloma (MM), ex vivo -cultured primary AML blasts, and oncogene-transformed hematopoietic cells. AML cell lines (OCI-AML2, OCI-AML3, HL-60) were strikingly sensitive to PD0325901 (IC 50 : 5\u201319 nM), NB4 (APL) and U266 (MM) showed intermediate sensitivity (IC 50 : 822 and 724 nM), while all the lymphoid cell lines tested and the myeloid cell lines U937 and KG1 were resistant (IC 50 > 1000 nM). Cell growth inhibition was due to inhibition of cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis. A statistically significant reduction in the proportion of S-phase cells ( p =0.01) and increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells ( p =0.019) was also observed in 18 primary AML samples in response to 100 nM PD0325901. Analysis of the correlation between sensitivity/resistance to PD0325901 and Ras/Raf mutation status is currently ongoing. PD0325901 effects were also examined in a panel of IL-3-dependent murine myeloid FDC-P1 cell lines transformed to grow in response to 11 different oncogenes in the absence of IL-3. Fms-, Ras-, Raf-1-, B-Raf-, MEK1-, IGF-1R-, and STAT5a-transformed FDC-P1 cells were very sensitive to PD0325901 (IC 50 : ~ 1 nM), while A-Raf-, BCR-ABL-, EGFR- or Src-transformed cells were 10 to 100 fold less sensitive (IC 50 : 10 to 100 nM); the parental, IL-3 dependent FDC-P1 cell line had an IC 50 > 1000 nM. Analysis of the phosphorylation levels of 18 different target proteins after treatment with 10 nM PD0325901 showed a 5- to 8-fold reduction in ERK-1/2, observed only in sensitive cell lines, and a 2-fold reduction in JNK and STAT3 phosphorylation. PD0325901 (10 nM) treatment also profoundly altered the gene expression profile of the sensitive cell line OCI-AML3: 96 genes were modulated after 24 h (37 up- and 59 down-regulated), most of which involved in cell cycle regulation. Changes in cyclin D1 and D3, cyclin E, and cdc 25A were also validated at the protein level. Overall, PD0325901 shows potent growth-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic activity, indicating that MEK may be an appropriate therapeutic target in an array of different hematological malignancies. Further preclinical/clinical development of this compound is warranted, particularly in myeloid leukemias.",
