    "abstract_text": "There is accumulating evidence that cellular microenvironment plays a key role in follicular lymphoma (FL) pathogenesis, both within tumor lymph nodes (LN) and in infiltrated bone marrow (BM) where ectopic LN-like reticular cells are integrated within malignant B-cell nodular aggregates. In normal secondary lymphoid organs, specific stromal cell subsets provide a highly specialized microenvironment that supports immune response. In particular, fibroblastic reticular cells (FRC) mediate immune cell migration, adhesion, and reciprocal interactions. The role of FRC and their postulated progenitors, i.e . bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), in FL remains unexplored. In this study, we have investigated the relationships between FRC and MSC and their capacity to sustain malignant B-cell growth. Our findings strongly suggest that secondary lymphoid organs contain bona-fide MSC able to give rise at single-cell level to adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. These LN-derived MSC could also differentiate, in response to a combination of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF) and lymphotoxin-\u03b11\u03b22 (LT), into fully functional FRC, able to construct a dense extracellular reticular meshwork positive for transglutaminase and fibronectin staining, to produce inflammatory (CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL5, CCL2) and LN-specific (CCL19) chemokines, and to favour lymphoma B-cell growth. Bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC) acquire in vitro a complete FRC phenotype in the same culture conditions. As an exemple, BM-MSC had a strong, although not complete, protective effect on serum deprivation-induced apoptosis of BL2 cell line (mean percentage of CD20 pos Caspase-3 pos cells: 24.8 +/\u2212 17.5% in coculture with BM-MSC versus 80.7 +/- 10.4% in medium alone; P < .05; n =5) and pretreatment with TNF/LT fully restored BL2 viability (mean percentage of CD20 pos Caspase-3 pos cells: 7.4 +/\u2212 4.7%; P < .05; n = 5). Moreover, stimulation of stromal cells by TNF/LT before coculture enhanced the number of viable CD19 pos primary FL B cells by 2.4-fold for BM-MSC and 2.3 fold for LN-MSC compared with the culture without stromal cells (P < .05; n = 6). Interestingly, cell contact with lymphoma B-cell lines or purified FL B cells trigger the differentiation of BM-MSC into FRC that, in turn, support malignant B-cell migration, adhesion and survival. Altogether, these new insights into the interactions between lymphoma cells and their microenvironment could offer original therapeutic strategies."
