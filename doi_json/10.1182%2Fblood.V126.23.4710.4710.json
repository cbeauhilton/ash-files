    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Hemophilia A (HA) and B (HB) are the most common congenital bleeding disorders, characterised by missing clotting factor VIII (FVIII) for HA or factor IX (FIX) for HB, associated with specific mutations for the corresponding genes. This is the first article to focus on a localised specific hemophiliac population in the French West Indies. Methods: Clinical, biological, genetic and socio-demographic data were collected at the Martinique Regional Centre for the Treatment of Hemophilia. Results: Nowadays patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand diseases can benefit from clinical and paramedical care comparable to what prevails in mainland France. 130 hemophilia patients were diagnosed in Martinique. This study provides the first global report on epidemiological characteristics of hemophilia in Martinique. Hemophilia treatment center was established in 2000, implementation of care services, number and diagnoses of hemophilia patients, frequency of complications such as inhibitors, HIV and hepatitis C infection, and underlying genetic mutations are described. Conclusion : These original data support that the French West Indies island of Martinique has the highest rate of HA and HB in the world compared to other countries. The establishment of a treatment center now provides standard of care to this population and may be a model for similar approaches in other French overseas regions.
