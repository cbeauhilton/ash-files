    "abstract_text": "Background Following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT), the phenotype and function of circulating NK Cells are altered; notably NK cells display an immature (CD56-bright/KIR - /CD57 - /NKG2A + ) phenotype and a low cytotoxic activity. Since NK cells have demonstrated anti-leukemic activity in the context of Allo-HCT while less prone to induce GVHD than T cells, we hypothesized that NKG2A inhibition using the checkpoint inhibitor monalizumab (humanized IgG4 blocking monoclonal antibody) could improve NK cell mediated graft-versus-tumor effect, without triggering graft-versus-host disease. We thus performed the first clinical trial evaluating the safety of monalizumab as a prophylactic treatment after Allo-HSCT (NCT02921685). Method The objective was to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of a single infusion of monalizumab administered on day+75 or thereafter following Allo-HSCT. Inclusion criteria were: 1) adult patients who underwent first Allo-HSCT for hematological malignancy; 2) no prior history of GVHD, 3) reduced toxicity conditioning regimen, 4) ATG or PT-Cy based GVHD prophylaxis, and 5) GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine A ongoing at the time of monalizumab infusion. Four dose levels were investigated in this dose escalation study (0.04, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg). Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were defined by the occurrence of any grade 3 to 4 monalizumab-related adverse event within 28 days after infusion, including grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD and moderate to severe chronic GVHD. In case of DLT, a Bayesian continuous reassessment model (CRM) was used to predict the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) after each series of 3 patients treated at a given dose level. It was planned to treat 18 patients. Beyond clinical safety, blood samples were collected for NK and T cell immunomonitoring and receptor saturation assay. Results Fifteen patients received monalizumab at a median time of 83 days (range: 75-103) after Allo-HSCT (3 at 0.04 mg/kg, 3 at 0.1 mg/kg, 3 at 0.3 mg/kg, and 6 at 1 mg/kg). Patients were transplanted for hematological diseases (9 AML, 3 MDS, 1 lymphoma, 1 CLL and 1 myelofibrosis), from a matched sibling (n=8), matched unrelated (n=6) or haploidentical donor (n=1). No DLT was observed during the dose escalation process or among the 6 patients treated at the highest dose level, justifying study early termination after 15 patients. Two patients developed transient low grade GVHD that spontaneously resolved without treatment (1 grade I acute GVHD on day+8 and 1 mild chronic GVHD on day+118). Systemic steroid requiring GVHD occurred in 3 patients (20%): 1 severe overlap GVHD (day+42, CR after treatment), 1 severe chronic GVHD (day+80, death from GVHD) and 1 late severe chronic GVHD after cyclosporine tapering for mixed chimerism (day+149, complete remission [CR] after treatment). No disease recurrence was observed, except for one patient with myelofibrosis who relapsed 3 years after monalizumab infusion. At a median follow up of 22 months (3-48) after monalizumab infusion, 13 out of 15 patients are in CR from their underlining malignancy without GVHD and immunosuppressive treatment at last contact. At the dose of 1 mg/kg, receptor saturation assays (RSA) showed persistent binding of monalizumab on peripheral blood NK cells. Indeed, more than 90% of NKG2A-positive NK cells were positive for monalizumab detection (Anti-IgG4-PE) until at least 14 weeks post treatment. Conclusions Monalizumab can be safely administered after Allo-HSCT, with prolonged persistence on circulating NK cells. In the absence of DLT, MTD was not reached. Future trials will aim at measuring the clinical efficacy of monalizumab in this context, alone or in combination therapy. Disclosures boyer Chammard:  Innate Pharma: Current Employment.
