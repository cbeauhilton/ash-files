    "abstract_text": "PU.1 (Sfpi1) is an ets family transcription factor required for the proper generation of both myeloid (macrophages and neutrophils) and lymphoid lineages (B and T lymphocytes)(Scott 1994, McKercher 1996). Graded expression of exogenous PU.1 in murine PU.1-deficient fetal liver hematopoietic progenitors demonstrated that increased levels of PU.1 are required to initiate development of macrophages (DeKoter, 2000). We have studied the effects of graded expression of PU.1 on its occupancy in chromatin and on the development of myeloid cells in vitro. We measured changes in gene expression, PU.1 occupancy and histone modifications in PU.1-null hematopoietic progenitor cells stably expressing PU.1 fused to the ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (PU.1-ER) (Walsh 2002). The level of active PU.1-ER was regulated with graded levels of the ER inducer tamoxifen. In vitro, intermediate levels of tamoxifen produced cells with granulocyte characteristics in the suspension cell fraction and macrophage-like characteristics in the attached fraction, whereas high levels of PU.1 produced mostly attached macrophage-like cells. Expression of granulocyte-specific PU.1 target mRNAs including gelatinase B (Mmp9) and myeloperoxidase (Mpo) were observed to be expressed only with intermediate levels of tamoxifen. In contrast, expression of macrophage PU.1 target mRNAs including Cd14, F4/80 and Cd68 mRNAs were observed to be gradually upregulated upon PU.1-ER activation, with the maximum expression at the highest levels of tamoxifen. Thus, the expression levels of PU.1 target genes and phenotypic characteristics of the cells are dependent on PU.1 levels. Interestingly, macrophage-like cells can be produced from granulocytic-like cells by changing tamoxifen levels and vice versa. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed specific PU.1 occupancy within regulatory regions of the genes predominantly expressed in macrophages including Cd14 and Cd11b after treatment with high levels of tamoxifen. Specific PU.1 occupancy within regulatory regions of the granulocyte specific genes including MMP9 was observed at intermediate levels of tamoxifen. Suprisingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed specific PU.1 occupancy within regulatory regions of the lymphocytic PU.1 target genes including Interleukin-7 receptor (Il-7r) and RAG1 at intermediate levels of tamoxifen even though expression of these genes was not detected. Accumulation of acetylated K9 and methylated K4 of histone H3 in gene loci of macrophage and granulocytic markers such as Cd14, Cd11b, and Mmp9 correlated with their mRNA expression. However, lymphocyte-specific regulatory regions including that of Il-7r gene were hypoacetylated in H3K9 despite a marked PU.1 recruitment suggesting additional factors may be required for PU.1 mediated transactivation. To identify these molecules we have tested PU.1-dependent transcription factors: Egr2, Nab2, Cebpa and Gfi-1 and found that upon increasing PU.1 levels, expression of Egr2/Nab2 and Gfi-1/Cebpa changed in a reciprocal manner and these changes preceded expression of the lineage specific markers. We are currently testing if PU.1 directly regulates expression of Egr2, Nab2, Cebpa and Gfi-1 during granulocytic/macrophage differentiation."
