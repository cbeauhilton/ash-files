    "abstract_text": "Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are emerging as a promising family of new agents in the therapy of hematologic malignancies. We have shown that phenyhexyl isothiocyanate(PHI) is a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor and can also modulate histone methylation in leukemia cells. In this study we investigated the effect of PHI on human myeloma cell line RPMI8226 in vitro. We have observed that cell proliferation was inhibited by PHI in a dose and time dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis indicated an arrest in G0/G1 phase, and significant apoptosis was detected in PHI treated RPMI8226 cells. The accumulation of P21 and reduced Levels of PCNA were detected. We also examined the effect of PHI on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by the myeloma cells. Treatment with 20\u03bcM PHI for 24hrs led to a decrease of VEGF concentration by 50% of that secreted by the control cells. VEGF production further decreased to 25% when the cells were exposed to PHI for 48hrs. These data suggest that myeloma cells are sensitive to the novel HDAC inhibitor, and PHI may become a novel agent in multiple myeloma therapy.
