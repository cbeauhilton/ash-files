    "abstract_text": "[Background] Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma, characterized by the overexpression of cyclin D1 derived from t(11;14)(q13;q32) and poor prognosis. Most MCLs show nodal presentation, but also accompany extranodal involvement, such as bone marrow, peripheral blood or gastrointestinal tract. As a result, many MCLs present with advanced stage disease. Since only a small portion of patients show limited-stage disease, minimal data exist on treatment of patients diagnosed with limited stage disease. Nevertheless, the treatment strategy of MCL is recommended according to the clinical stage of limited- (stage I or non-bulky II) vs. advanced-stage, as well as other types of lymphoma. [Patients and methods] We recently collected 633 patient data of MCL (Chihara, et al. Ann Oncol 2015). Information of clinical stage was available in 626 patients. The patient data were retrospectively analyzed the by the clinical stage at initial presentation. [Results] The clinical stage was I in 24 patients (4%), II in 33 (5%), III in 70 (11%), and IV in 499 (80%). Only one patient presented with bulky stage II. Detailed demographic information by the clinical stage are listed in Table. Age and sex were not significantly different by clinical stage. Limited stage patients were associated with better performance status (PS), less B symptoms, no extranodal involvement, and lower lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and white blood cell (WBC) count. Most patients in any stage were treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy, but more patients in limited stage received radiotherapy. The proportion of high-dose cytarabine (HDCA)-containing regimen over CHOP/CHOP-like was higher in advanced stage patients. Complete and overall response rates were 92% and 96% in stage I, 58% and 94% in stage II, 66% and 86% in stage III, and 52% and 82% in stage IV, respectively (P = 0.02). However, the higher response rate in limited stage patients did not translate into better prognosis. The median survival was 11.0 years in stage I, 13.4 years in stage II, 11.5 years in stage III, and 5.6 years in stage IV (Figure). The prognosis was not significantly different among patients with stage I, II, and III (P = 0.33). [Conclusion] Prognosis of limited-stage MCL was almost similar to that of stage III MCL. Although the present study includes several limitations including a retrospective nature and limited number of patients, prognosis of patients with limited-stage MCL was not satisfactory. The significance of radiotherapy, as well as the optimal choice of chemotherapy, for limited-stage MCL needs re-evaluation.
