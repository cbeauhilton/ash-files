    "abstract_text": "BION-1301 is a first-in-class humanized antibody targeting APRIL (TNFSF13). We demonstrated that BION-1301 inhibits proliferation and survival of tumor cells and alleviates both APRIL-mediated drug resistance and immune suppression in preclinical multiple myeloma (MM) models 1 . BION-1301 inhibits ligand dependent activation of both receptors TACI and BCMA, and as such differentiates from BCMA (TNFSF17) targeting cytotoxic approaches. Here, we report on the preclinical safety, Pharmacokinetics (PK)/ Pharmacodynamics (PD) relationship and pharmacometric analysis of BION-1301. A single-dose non-human primate study administering intravenous BION-1301 at 0.3, 3 and 30 mg/kg dose levels, yielded PK parameters typical for IgG4 class antibodies and absence of tolerability issues. PD analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in total IgA and IgM in a dose-dependent fashion. Another measure of target modulation by BION-1301 was provided by co-injection of the hapten TNP-Ficoll (T-cell independent antigen) in different dose groups. Consistent with our observations in hAPRIL transgenic mice and in a dose-dependent fashion, BION-1301 reduced TNP-specific IgA and IgM 2 . Using a weekly dosing regimen, a 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study was executed at 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg, demonstrating that BION-1301 had no effect on vital organs, ECG's, blood pressure, neurobehavioral examinations, and other factors examined, at any dose level at up to 100mg/kg. Chronic exposure to BION-1301 led to significantly reduced levels of IgA, IgG and IgM observed at all dose levels. To determine target engagement of BION-1301, quantitative assays were developed to detect free APRIL and BION-1301. BION-1301 reduced free APRIL levels in serum in a dose-dependent manner following single and multiple dose administrations. Using a MABEL approach, PK/PD pharmacometric modeling informed a proposed human starting dose of 50 mg. We anticipate initiation of a clinical trial to characterize safety and PK/PD relationship of BION-1301 in heavily pretreated patients with MM. Eligible patients need to have received at least 3 prior treatment lines, including IMiDs, PIs, and monoclonal antibodies. Following identification of a recommended Phase 2 dose, an expanded cohort will investigate clinical activity of single-agent BION-1301. The clinical activity of BION-1301 in combination with other MM therapies as informed by our preclinical experiments will be investigated in additional clinical trials. In summary, BION-1301 was well tolerated and binding of APRIL in non-human primates resulted in decreased IgA, IgG and IgM production. PK and target engagement biomarkers predict the first in human dose using PK/PD modeling. BION-1301, which was shown preclinically to inhibit MM proliferation, survival, drug resistance and reversed an immune suppressive phenotype 1 , is expected to enter clinical trials in 2017.
