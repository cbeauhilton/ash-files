    "abstract_text": "Introduction . Although Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is one of the most curable malignancies, 10-30% of patients experience resistance or relapse following initial response. Treatment options for relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease include usually multi-agent chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHSCT). Although many chemotherapy-based regimens are used as salvage, the optimal one has not been defined so far. The goal of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of bendamustine in combination with gemcitabine and dexamethasone (BGD) in R/R HL. Patients and Methods . This was a retrospective, single center study, including 30 consecutive R/R HL patients treated between 2016 and 2018. Median age was 33 (19-82) years. Ten patients (33%) had been pre-treated with at least 2 lines of chemotherapy; 11 patients (37%) with radiotherapy, 6 patients (20%) with autoHSCT while 4 patients (13%) with allogeneic (allo)HSCT. Six patients (20%) were resistant to previous salvage treatment. BGD therapy consisted of bendamustine 90mg/m2 on days 1 and 2, gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 on days 1 and 4, dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4. Best response after at least 2 courses of therapy was the primary study end-point. Results . Median number of BGD cycles was 4 (2-7). Nineteen (63%) patients achieved complete remission (CR) confirmed by FDG-PET, while 6 patients (20%) achieved partial response (PR), accounting for 83% overall response (OR) rate. Stable disease was reported in 3 patients and progressive disease - in 2 cases. Many patients achieved CR (33%) or PR (33%) after 2 cycles of BGD. The OR rate was 85% for patients in whom BGD was administered as first salvage and 80% when used in more advanced stages of the disease. Fourteen patients proceeded to autoHSCT while 4 patients were subsequently treated with alloHSCT. Six patients experienced infections of the upper respiratory tract while two patients had allergic skin reactions. No organ toxicity was reported. One patient required transfusion of red blood cells while none was treated with platelet transfusions. Conclusion . BGD is a highly effective, well-tolerated salvage regimen for patients with R/R HL. The protocol may be used as a bridge to autoHSCT or alloHSCT. Further, prospective studies are warranted to define its role in future treatment algorithms.
