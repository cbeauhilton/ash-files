    "abstract_text": "Background & Hypothesis: B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and oncogenic tyrosine kinases that mimic BCR-signaling in B-lineage leukemia and lymphoma depend on assembly of membrane proximal signaling complexes. Signalosomes in normal BCR- and oncogene (e.g. BCR-ABL1, RAS-pathway lesions) signal transduction are recruited to phospholipid anchors in lipid rafts. The robustness of these complexes depends on cholesterol accumulation in lipid rafts. Here we identified the interferon-induced transmembrane protein IFITM3 as a central regulator of cholesterol in lipid rafts. Results: IFITM3 is mostly localized to endosomal compartments. By antagonizing VAP-A and oxysterol-binding protein 1 (OSBP1), IFITM3 promotes cholesterol accumulation and solidifies the endosomal membrane. This mechanism is particular important in anti-viral immunity, to \"trap\" intraluminal viral particles for lysosomal degradation. In B-cells, IFITM3 can translocate to the cell membrane and form a complex with the BCR and its co-receptors CD19, CD81 and CD21. While the functional significance of membrane expression of IFITM3 on B-cells was not known, we found that higher IFITM3 mRNA levels at the time of diagnosis represents a strong predictor of poor clinical outcome for children (COG P9906; P =0.006; n=207) and adults (ECOG E2993; P=0.014; n=215) with B-ALL. In addition, higher than median IFITM3 mRNA levels at the time of diagnosis were associated with a higher risk of relapse and positive MRD status at the end of induction chemotherapy in B-ALL and other B-cell malignancies. Interestingly, IFITM3 is a transcriptional target and strongly repressed by IKZF1 (Ikaros) a potent tumor suppressor in B- ALL and high IFITM3 mRNA levels represents a biomarker for patients with IKZF1 -deletion. While its membrane-topology can vary in different cell types, we found that IFITM3 functions as a dual-pass transmembrane protein in tight association with CD19 and the Iga and Igb signaling chains of the BCR in B-ALL and B-cell lymphoma cells. To study the function of Ifitm3 in a model for human pre-B ALL, pre-B cells from Ifitm3 -/- mice were transformed with BCR-ABL1 or oncogenic NRAS G12D . Strikingly, deletion of IFITM3 resulted in destabilization of lipid rafts, loss of CD19 surface expression and loss of PI3K signaling. Ifitm3-/- leukemia cells could not sustain oncogenic signaling from BCR-ABL1 or oncogenic NRAS G12D and failed to initiate fatal leukemia in transplant recipient mice. These changes were paralleled by G0/1 cell cycle arrest (P<0.001), loss of colony formation capacity (P=0.0004) and increased propensity to apoptosis. In mechanistic studies, we identified type II transmembrane topology for IFITM3 at plasma membrane with extracellular C and intracellular N terminus which interacted with CD19, LYN, SYK, PI3K and AKT ( see schematic, left ). Disruption of endocytic motif ( 20 YEML 23 ) by substitution of Tyr 20 to Phe induced IFITM3 gain of function and forced accumulation of IFITM3 on the cell membrane, constitutive CD19-PI3K signaling, intracellular calcium mobilization, homotypic cellular aggregation and massively increased proliferation of pre-B ALL cells ( see schematic, right ). Conversely, inducible overexpression of IKZF1 transcriptionally silenced IFITM3, resulting in loss of IFITM3 expression, reduction of lipid rafts and impairment of membrane-associated oncogenic signaling. Through Filipin-based cholesterol staining, we found Ifitm3 -/- pre-B cells have reduced levels of cholesterol in lipid rafts, which causes disruption of lipid rafts formation, as reflected by decreased levels of ganglioside G M1 . Notably, the homeostatic cholesterol fluidity by presence of IFITM3 on plasma membrane was also required for initiation of B- and T cell receptor signaling in mature B- and T cell lymphoma to induce Ca 2+ mobilization. Conclusions: These findings identify novel role of the viral immunity IFITM3 surface receptor as a central regulator of cell membrane cholesterol fluidity and critical mediator of sustained oncogenic tyrosine kinase (BCR-ABL1) and RAS ( NRAS G12D ) signaling in B cell malignancies. In promoting cholesterol aggregates in lipid rafts, IFITM3 protects healthy individuals from potentially lethal viral infections, but also enables oncogenic signaling by providing a robust membrane scaffold for tyrosine kinase and RAS-pathway oncogenes.
