[Objective and method] To investigate the incidence and clinical features of IPS/DAH after unrelated cord blood transplantation (uCBT), we retrospectively analyzed 370 patients underwent uCBT from January 2005 to June 2010 at Toranomon Hospital. Diagnosis of IPS/DAH was made by multilobar infiltrates on CXR or CT, clinical signs of pneumonia: cough, dyspnea, or rales, abnormal physiology: increased arterial-alveolar oxygen gradient, or the needfor supplemental oxygen support, and no evidence of respiratory tract infection. [Result:] Twenty five cases of IPS/DAH were identified, with incidence of 6.8%. The median-age was 59 years (range; 26\u201372). Nineteen patients underwent transplantation for leukemia, 4 for malignant lymphoma, and 2 for aplastic anemia. IPS/DAH was diagnosed at a median of 34 days (range; 8\u201393) after uCBT. All patients were administered mPSL therapy. Nine of 25 patients were administered etanercept combined with mPSL pulse therapy. Five of 9 had not responded, while 4 responders had worse their respiratory condition after discontinuation of etanercept therapy. Twenty four of 25 died of respiratory failure. [Conclusion] IPS/DAH after uCBT are fetal pulmonary complications. It is suggested that the incidence of IPS/DAH after uCBT appears similar to that observed after transplantation using other sources. But our results suggested that the existing treatment such as etanercept combined mPSL pulse have only limited efficacy as a therapy for IPS/DAH after uCBT. Further research is needed to characterize the condition of this syndrome and to investigate the optimal therapy and prophylaxis. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
