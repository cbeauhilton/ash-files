    "abstract_text": "Introduction: AFM13 is a bispecific, tetravalent TandAb antibody that targets CD16A and CD30. Preclinical data demonstrated that AFM13 specifically harnessed NK cells to exert potent cytotoxic effects on tumor cells expressing CD30. Furthermore, AFM13 showed a favorable toxicity profile in cynomolgus monkeys. HL is characterized by the presence of CD30 + Reed-Sternberg cells and by a high medical need in the r/r setting, especially since the response to brentuximab vedotin in this patient group is mostly short. Here, we present the final results of a phase 1 clinical study in r/r HL including a focus on the pre-treatment with brentuximab vedotin. Methods: Heavily pretreated patients (pts.) with r/r HL received stepwise escalated doses of intravenous AFM13 (0.01 to 7.0 mg/kg) weekly or 4.5 mg/kg twice weekly over 4 weeks. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability, secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and clinical efficacy measured using Cheson criteria. Results: 28 pts. were recruited, 24 pts. received AFM13 weekly and 4 pts. received AFM13 twice weekly. AFM13 was well tolerated with mainly mild to moderate adverse events. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. AFM13 demonstrated activity, which was consistently more pronounced for all assessed parameters at doses \u22651.5 mg/kg (n=13). 3 of 13 pts. (23%) exhibited partial responses and disease control was reached in 10 of 13 pats. (77%). Importantly, AFM13 was also active in pts. refractory to brentuximab vedotin as most recent treatment. PK data revealed an AFM13 half-life of up to 19 hours. In peripheral blood, the portion of activated NK cells (CD69 + ), relative to total number of NK cells, increased up to 3-fold 24 hours after infusion compared to baseline. Kinetics of NK cell activation corresponded to kinetics of AFM13 serum levels. Soluble CD30 declined to zero at the end of treatment in almost all pts. Conclusion: Phase 1 data indicate that AFM13 is active and well tolerated in heavily pretreated r/r HL pts. including brentuximab vedotin failures. To further enhance efficacy of AFM13 both, the dose regimen (based on PK/PD profile) and the duration of treatment, will be optimized in a phase 2 study. This study is currently in preparation by the German Hodgkin Study Group.
