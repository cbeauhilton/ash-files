    "abstract_text": "Despite aggressive chemotherapy and a high remission induction rate, approximately one third of children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse. Therefore, novel and more effective treatments are urgently needed. Survivin is an inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein that plays a key role in regulating cell division, proliferation and apoptosis (Altieri et al , Nat Rev Cancer, 2008). Furthermore, high expression of survivin and its splice variants have been shown to be associated with poor clinical outcome in AML (Moore et al , ASH Abstract 3555, 2011; Carter et al , Blood, 2012). The small-molecule survivin suppressant YM155 (sepantronium bromide) has been demonstrated to have pre-clinical activity against a range of solid cancers and leukemias, although data in AML is limited, particularly in pediatric models. Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive pre-clinical evaluation of YM155 in AML, with a focus on pediatric disease. When tested in vitro against a diverse panel of 9 AML cell lines, YM155 potently inhibited cell viability with a median IC 50 of 0.03 \u00b5M (range 0.001 - 0.680 \u00b5M; Table 1 ). All 4 pediatric cell lines tested (Kasumi-1, MV4-11, THP-1 and CMK) were particularly sensitive to YM155, with IC 50 values in the range of 0.010 - 0.053 \u00b5M. Of note, YM155 had generally similar in vitro efficacy to daunorubicin, but was more potent than cytarabine in 7 of the 9 cell lines. Table 1 In vitro sensitivity of AML cell lines to YM155, cytarabine and daunorubicin, as measured by 72 hour cell viability (resazurin reduction) assays. Values indicate median IC 50 (\u00b5M) from at least 3 independent experiments. *Pediatric AML cell lines. NS, not significant.  AML Cell Line . Characteristic Feature . YM155 . Cytarabine .

An apoptotic mechanism of cell death was confirmed by an increase in annexin V positivity, measured by flow cytometry. Consistent with the proposed mechanism of action, YM155 treatment also caused down-regulation of total survivin protein expression in AML cell lines. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrated that YM155 was cytotoxic against a panel of 7 primary, diagnostic bone marrow samples from children with AML (median age 4.8 years, range 1.3-15.7). Patient samples were obtained from the Queensland Children's Tumour Bank and had diverse cytogenetic and molecular characteristics, including CBF-AML, monosomy 7, MLL gene rearrangements and FLT3 -ITD. Similar to experiments in established cell lines, YM155 treatment caused an apoptotic response, as evidenced by induction of annexin V positivity. In conclusion, YM155 has potent pre-clinical activity against a broad panel of AML cell lines and patient samples. Pediatric AML appears to be particularly sensitive to YM155. These data suggest that YM155-mediated inhibition of survivin is a potentially beneficial therapeutic strategy for AML, particularly childhood disease, and warrants further pre-clinical and clinical evaluation.
