Stem cell concentrates from bone marrow aspirate (BMA) were prepared in less than 15 minutes. The bone marrow concentrate was collected in the device funnel and extracted in a harvesting syringe. The cellular components of samples were analyzed pre- and post processing. STUDY DESIGN For this study 4 anticoagulated bone marrows were processed. All samples were evaluated for cell recovery, hematocrit, total nucleated cells (TNC), mononuclear cells (MNC), CD34+ cells, cell viability and colony forming units before and after Res-Q60 processing. The Res Q processed post samples were cultured and cells characterized by flow cytometry using cell surface markers. RESULTS The Res-Q60 process achieved MNC fraction volumes of 6.7 \u00b1 0.1 ml with a final average hematocrit of 17\u00b1 0.6%. The post-processing recovery of CD34+ cells was 90 \u00b112.7%, of MNC was 85 \u00b1 4% and of TNC was 64 \u00b1 13%. No change in cell viability was observed using the Res-Q60 device. Res-Q derived cell concentrate cultured in mesenchymal stem cells basal media followed by immunophenotyping measured by flow cytometry were \u2265 95% positive for CD73, CD90 and CD105. The same cells lack (\u2264 5%) expression of CD31 and CD34. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, Res-Q60 system provides a new simple method for preparation of cell concentrates from bone marrow at the point of care. Disclosures: Kumar: Thermogenesis Corp.: Employment.
