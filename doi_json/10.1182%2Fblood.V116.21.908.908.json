    "abstract_text": "Abstract 908 Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) are the preferred graft source for RIC transplantation. As in other settings, if a suitable unrelated adult donor is not available, primarily HLA mismatched unrelated cord blood (CB) is increasingly utilized, including the co-infusion of two CB units to overcome the cell dose limitation. We here report the relative efficacy of double CB (dCB, n=161) transplantation vs. PBPC whether from an 8/8 HLA matched (MUD, n=313) vs. 1 allele mismatched (MMUD, n=111) unrelated donor in patients with acute myeloid (AML, n=523) and lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n=62) transplanted between 2000 and 2009. Patients were aged 21 \u2013 69 years. dCB recipients were more likely to be younger (median age: 54 vs. MUD 59 vs. MMUD 58 years, p<0.001), to have ALL (20% vs. MUD 6% vs. MMUD 10%, p<0.001) and to be in 1 st or 2 nd complete remission (83% vs. MUD 74% vs. MMUD 65%, p<0.001). Transplant conditioning regimens differed between dCB and PBPC transplants. Approximately 75% of dCB recipients received TBI 200 cGy + cyclophosphamide + fludarabine (TCF) \u00b1 ATG, 20% received melphalan or busulfan (Bu) or cyclophosphamide (Cy) + fludarabine \u00b1 ATG and the remaining 5%, TBI + fludarabine \u00b1 alkylating agent \u00b1 ATG. In contrast, approximately 75% of PBPC recipients received melphalan or Bu or Cy + fludarabine \u00b1 ATG. While there were no differences in overall survival by conditioning regimen in PBPC recipients, conditioning regimen influenced survival in recipients of dCB with the best survival in those treated with TCF. Therefore, 4 groups were created for multivariate analysis comparing transplant outcomes: dCB after TCF, dCB after other RIC regimens, MUD and MMUD; results are shown in the Table below. Compared to dCB after TCF, grade 2\u20134 but not grade 3\u20134 acute GVHD was lower in those with a MUD and chronic GVHD was higher in those with either a MUD or MMUD. Compared to dCB after other RIC regimens, transplant-related mortality (TRM) and overall mortality were lower after MUD and dCB after TCF transplants but similar to those after MMUD transplants. The 2-year probabilities of TRM in recipients of dCB after TCF, dCB after other RIC regimens, MUD and MMUD transplants are 19%, 52%, 21% and 28%, respectively. The corresponding probabilities for overall survival, adjusted for disease status and performance score were 38%, 19%, 44% and 37%. These data support dCB after TCF for adults with acute leukemia where a transplant is indicated but a suitably HLA matched unrelated adult donor is not available or when transplant is needed urgently. Although a center-effect could not be demonstrated statistically (p=0.2), a substantial proportion of dCB patients treated with TCF were done at a single center. Results of an ongoing multi-center phase II trial evaluating dCB after TCF will verify the reproducibility of these results.  . Grade 2\u20134 Acute GVHD * . Chronic GVHD * . TRM . Relapse \u2020 .
