    "abstract_text": "Background : Studies evaluating the prognostic impact of the expression of the oncogenes HOX11 and HOX11L2 in adult T-ALL have been controversial so far. Methods: In the two consecutive German Multicenter ALL (GMALL) therapy trials 5/93 and 6/99, 503 T-ALL pts were recruited between 4/93 and 10/03. Of these, 286 patients with adult T-ALL have been retrospectively investigated for the expression of HOX11 and HOX11L2. This represents the largest cohort of adult T-ALL patients investigated so far. Expression was measured in pretreatment peripheral blood and bone marrow blasts by comparative real-time RT-PCR. Results: The median age was 30 (16\u201365)yrs, 76% were male, 69% had a mediastinal tumor, 24% WBC > 100.000 and 7% CNS involvement. 61 patients (21%) showed a high and 57 patients (20%) a low HOX11 expression, 165 patients (59%) did not express HOX11. In comparison, 29 patients (10%) expressed HOX11L2 whereas 256 (91%) did not show a HOX11L2 expression. The prevalence of HOX11L2 expression was higher in the youngest age group (median 20 yrs vs. 31 yrs in \u201cnegative\u201d pts, p=0,025). CNS involvement was more frequently found in the high HOX11 expression group (p=0,025). High HOX11 expression and HOX11L2 expression were both significantly associated with the thymic immunophenotype (p=0.0077 and 0,031, respectively). There were no significant differences in CR rates between the HOX11- and HOX11L2-expression subgroups. In contrast, HOX11L2 positive patients showed a higher relapse rate (52% vs. 28%; P=0.011). The overall survival (OS) was higher for pts. with high HOX11 expression (OS at 5 years: high 69% vs low 36% vs negative 41%; p=0.007), and disease free survival (DFS) was significantly longer in the high HOX11 expression group (at 5 years high 73% vs low 41% vs negative 47%; p=0.007). For HOX11L2 expression the difference in OS did not reach statistical significance regarding all T-ALL patients (at 5 yrs: positive 13% vs negative 49%; p=0.06). Controlling for the immunophenotype, a significant difference in OS became evident (at 5 yrs: positive 19% vs negative 64%; p=0.01). DFS was significantly shorter in HOX11L2 positive patients (at 5 yrs: positive 24% vs negative 56%; p=0.03). In a multivariate analysis the expression of HOX11 could not be confirmed as independent prognostic factor for OS or DFS (p\u22650,05). In contrast, HOX11L2 expression was found to be the only relevant prognostic factor besides the immunophenotype: The hazard ratio of death was 1,8 for HOX11L2 positive T-ALL patients (95% CI 1.1\u20133,0; P=0,021), and the hazard ratio for a relapse was 2,0 (95% CI 1.1\u20133,7; P=0.023). Conclusions: HOX11 expression is highly associated with the thymic immunophenoytpe and is not an independent prognostic factor. The expression of HOX11L2 is also predominantly found in thymic T-ALL. Whereas the majority of thymic T-All patients do not express HOX11L2 and have an improved outcome, HOX11L2 expression identifies a small subset of thymic T-ALL patients with a reduced OS and DFS, similarly to early and mature T-ALL. If this can be confirmed prospectively, thymic T-ALL patients need to be treated according to their HOX11L2 expression status as different entities: HOX11L2 positive thymic T-ALL patient requiring a rather aggressive therapeutical management."
