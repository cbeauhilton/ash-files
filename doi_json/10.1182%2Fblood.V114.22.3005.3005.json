Using null mice for the ST3Gal-IV sialyltransferase gene (ST3Gal-IV \u2212/\u2212 mice), we have recently identified galactose residues on the N-terminus of the platelet Von Willebrand Factor receptor GPIb\u03b1a as a major counter receptor for the lectin domain of the asialoglycoprotein receptor on both hepatocytes and liver Kupffer cells (S\u00f8rensen et al., Blood 2009). ST3Gal-IV \u2212/\u2212 mice have increased tail bleeding time. However, the role of terminal sialic acid residues on platelet activation is unclear. We investigated here whether loss of sialylation affects platelet activation mediated through the collagen receptor GPVI or by thrombin. Platelets were isolated from ST3Gal-IV \u2212/\u2212 and ST3Gal-IV +/+ mouse littermates, stimulated with collagen-related peptide (CRP), convulxin (CVX), or thrombin, and platelet activation was evaluated by flow cytometry using P-selectin expression, as a marker for \u03b1a-granule secretion, and fibrinogen binding, as a marker for integrin \u03b1aIIb\u03b23 activation. Stimulation of ST3Gal-IV \u2212/\u2212 platelets with CRP and CVX revealed a profound activation defect, compared to ST3Gal-IV +/+ platelets. The defect was not due to loss of surface receptor expression since ST3Gal-IV \u2212/\u2212 and ST3Gal-IV +/+ platelets had comparable GPVI expression, as evidenced by flow cytometry. By contrast, activation of ST3Gal-IV \u2212/\u2212 platelets with thrombin was normal. The data show that terminal sialic acid residues on GPVI are required for maximal platelet activation by CRP and CVX. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
