    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Increasing multi-ethnicity is likely to make \u03b1-thalassemia more prevalent in western metropolitan areas. The current prevalence of \u03b1-thalassemia in regions outside the traditional thalassemia areas with the associated risk for HbH disease and hydrops foetalis is unknown. Genetic counseling for reproductive risks due to \u03b1-globin gene mutations requires adequate and precise genotyping. Objectives: To determine by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (m-PCR) the prevalence and genotypes of \u03b1-thalassemia among non selected, consecutive cases of unexplained microcytosis identified in a clinical hematology laboratory. To evaluate if differences or variations in erythrocytic indices are indicative of \u03b1-thalassemia. Methods: During a period of 3 months, \u03b1-globin genotype was determined by m-PCR on all non repetitive microcytic (MCV <80fL) blood samples from adults with normal ferritin and normal hemoglobin HPLC analysis (Variant I, Bio-Rad). A previously described m-PCR analysis allowed the detection of \u03b1-globin gene deletions and specifically identified each of the following 7 deletions when present: \u2212\u03b1 3.7 , \u2212\u03b1 4.2 , \u2212\u2212 SEA , \u2212\u2212 FIL , \u2212\u2212 MED , \u2212\u2212 THAI and \u2212\u03b1 (20.5) . Results: 516 microcytic blood samples were evaluated of which 197 had normal ferritin and Hb HPLC analysis and were submitted for m-PCR. Among 196 interpretable m-PCRs, 148 did not have \u03b1-globin gene deletion(s) (group 1) and 48 \u03b1-thalassemia cases (24,5%) were identified: 28 cases of single \u03b1-globin gene deletion (group 2) and 20 cases of 2 \u03b1-globin gene deletions (group 3). In group 3, 6 cases showed deletions in cis. Results on differences between the groups are presented in Table 1. Even though some differences were statistically different, none was clinically useful and diagnostic. Conclusion : A significant proportion (24,5%) of cases with microcytosis not likely explained by iron deficiency, inflammation or a hemoglobinopathy are caused by \u03b1-globin gene deletion(s). This laboratory survey, despite a short period of sample collection (3 months) identified 6 carriers of a 2 gene deletion in cis that may have a severe impact on reproductive decisions and potential future utilisation of resources. These findings are likely to be reproducible in other North American cosmopolitan cities where \u03b1-thalassemia is not endemic but likely to be of increasing prevalence due to immigration. The availability, precision and reliability of diagnostic methods such as m-PCR and the increasing ethnic diversity of North-American cities point to an emerging need to develop genetic counseling programs based on the molecular diagnosis of \u03b1-thalassemia.
