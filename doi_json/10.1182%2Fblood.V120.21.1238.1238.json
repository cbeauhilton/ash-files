    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1238 PF4 (CXCL4), a platelet specific chemokine released in large amounts from activated platelet \u03b1 -granules, is a negative regulator of megakaryopoiesis. In mouse studies, we have shown that PF4 levels regulate steady-state platelet count and impact chemotherapy and radiation-induced thrombocytopenia. In a clinical study in leukemia patients, we found that PF4 levels were inversely related to steady-state platelet count and to recovery after chemotherapy. The molecular basis for the effect of PF4 in megakaryopoiesis is largely unknown. Our studies in cell models suggested that PF4 might act through the cell surface receptor low-density lipoprotein related protein-1 (LRP1). Using an early megakaryoblastic cell line, which expresses LRP1, Meg-like cell line (Meg01), we show that PF4 exerts an anti-proliferative effect on the cells through inactivation of cell cycle regulators CDC2 (CDK1) and CDK2. PF4 treatment (200 \u03bcg/ml for 48 hrs) of Meg01 cells induced a decrease in cells in G1 (from 68% of cells to 51%, p=0.001) with a concurrent increase in the percentage of cells in S (12% of cells to 21%, p = 0.02 for no PF4 vs. PF4 treatment) and G2 (from 20% to 28% of cells) phase, without significant bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation by the cells in the S phase, suggesting that PF4 causes a cell cycle arrest resulting in decreased cell proliferation. The cell cycle arrest and lack of BrDU incorporation was confirmed in primary murine Megs. No apoptosis was detected in PF4 treated Meg01 or primary cells. To determine the molecular mechanisms by which PF4 causes cell cycle arrest, we used Western blots interrogating cell cycle proteins. We detected a transient increase in the inhibitory phosphorylation (at Tyr15) of CDC2 after PF4 treatment, as well as a decrease in phosphorylation of the activating site (Thr160) on CDK2. In addition, we found PF4 treatment resulted in the degradation of Cdc25c, the upstream phosphatase of Tyr15 of CDC2. In primary murine Megs, we detected a significant decrease of total CDC2, biologically equivalent to the CDC2 inactivation seen in Meg01 cells. The CDK inhibitor Roscovitine inhibited Meg01 cell proliferation and had minimum additive effect with PF4. Overexpression of the constitutively active CDC2 mutant CDC2AF with the inhibitory phosphorylation sites Thr14 and Tyr15 replaced by Ala and Phe, respectively, desensitized the cells to PF4 treatment. These results suggested that PF4 inhibits megakaryopoiesis by decreasing the proliferation of megakaryocytes in their early developmental stage by inactivating cell cycle regulators CDC2 and CDK2. Unraveling the mechanisms by which PF4 inhibits megakaryopoiesis may lead to the development of novel therapeutics to regulate platelet counts.
