    "abstract_text": "Background: HCT is physically and psychologically challenging and patients are prone to QoL impairments. AYAs are a unique population that faces hurdles due to dynamic changes in several aspects of their life, and may be particularly prone to QoL issues during HCT. The aim of this study was to determine if QoL differences exist between AYA and older adult HCT recipients pre- and post-HCT. Additionally, we aimed to determine if there has been a change in QoL for AYA transplant recipients in recent years, as more focus has been placed on supporting this unique population. Methods: QoL data were collected prospectively pre-HCT (baseline [BL]) and in follow-up post-transplant on patients undergoing HCT from Jun 2003 through Dec 2017 at Cleveland Clinic. Autologous HCT recipients are followed routinely through day +42 post-transplant, while allogeneic recipients are followed through at least one year or more. QoL was self-reported by patients using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplantation (FACT-BMT) questionnaire. FACT-BMT consists of five domain scores (Physical Wellbeing [PWB], Social Wellbeing [SWB], Emotional Wellbeing [EWB], Functional Wellbeing [FWB], and Additional Concerns [AC]) and two summary scores (trial outcome index [TOI, PWB+FWB+AC], and Total FACT Score. Scores were compared for younger AYA (age 15-29 years), older AYA (age 30-39 years) and older adults (age 40-60 years). We excluded patients >60 years from analysis as this group may have their own unique challenges. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess differences among age groups and among time points. Pearson correlation (r) was used to determine if BL QOL had improved from 2003-2017 in AYA cohort. Separate analyses were performed for autologous and allogeneic cohorts. Results: Autologous HCT cohort included 128 AYA patients (56 younger AYA) and 355 older adults, and allogeneic HCT cohort included 136 AYA patients (76 younger AYA) and 295 older adults Autologous patients in all three groups were similar for baseline characteristics except for diagnosis (table 1). Among allogeneic patients similar rates of graft-versus host disease were seen for all three groups, and baseline characteristics were similar except for ECOG performance status (table 1). Among autologous recipients, no single QoL domain or composite score differed among the three age groups at baseline or at day +42 post-HCT (Figure 1a). In all age groups, QoL improved from baseline to D+42 in autologous HCT recipients (mean Total Score 149 vs. 152, p=0.001). Similarly, among the allogeneic HCT recipients, no single QoL domain or composite score differed among the three age groups at baseline, day +100, +180, or +365 post-HCT (Figure 1b). Among all patients compared to BL (mean 146), total FACT score improved at day +180 (150, p=0.022) and +365 (152, p=0.005), but not at day 100 (145, p=0.57). Among autologous recipients, none of the BL FACT domains improved over time since 2003. In contrast, AYA allogeneic recipients also had no significant change in BL scores since 2003 for PWB, SWB, EWB, FWB, however there was improvement in AC (r=0.26, p=0.003, TOI (r=0.23, p=0.008), and total FACT score (r=0.19, p=0.03). Conclusions: AYA HCT recipients do not have inferior QoL compared to older adults in the first 42 days after autologous HCT and the first year after allogeneic HCT. Interestingly, QoL improvements in AYA patients have occurred in recent years for allogeneic but not autologous patients. Improvements in QoL of allogeneic patients is driven by the AC domain, which addresses multiple psychosocial aspects which have been emphasized in recent years. Continued efforts to tailor treatment and support for AYA HSCT recipients is critical to improving outcomes.
