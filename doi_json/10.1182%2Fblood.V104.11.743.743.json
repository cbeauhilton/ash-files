    "abstract_text": "CPG 7909 belongs to a new class of chemically defined CpG immunomodulators that target dendritic cell TLR9 receptors inducing IL-12, IFN-gamma, and NK cell function. The rate and durability of response to CPG 7909 was investigated in refractory patients with recurrent or advanced CTCL, who had failed one or more systemic therapies. Dose escalation with weekly sc dosing of patients at 0.08, 0.16, 0.24, or 0.28 mg/kg (3 patients/cohort) for 24 weeks is nearing completion. Additional patients continue to receive treatment at 0.32 (4 patients) or 0.36 mg/kg (12 patients). Clinical response, monitored by Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (CA) and Physician\u2019s Global Assessment of Clinical Condition, has been documented. Of 28 patients enrolled, 7 (25%) have achieved objective clinical response, 5 with partial response (PR) and 2 with complete response (CR). Eleven patients have maintained stable disease (SD), while 10 have had progressive disease (PD). Eight patients have completed 24 weeks of treatment (5 SD, 2 PR, 1 CR) with 12\u201316 weeks of response while on study. Six patients (3 SD, 2 PR,1 CR) are currently ongoing in the study. Three patients (2 PR, 1 SD) continue to receive long term CPG 7909 at 0.12 mg/kg (58 total doses), 0.28 mg/kg (34 total doses) or 0.32 mg/kg (29 total doses) in a follow on protocol. Responses have been maintained up to 46 weeks. Weekly doses up to 0.36 mg/kg have been well tolerated. Most reported adverse events have been of CTC grade 1 or 2. The most common are dose-related local injection site reactions (erythema, induration, edema, inflammation and pain) and mild or moderate flu-like symptoms (fatigue, rigors, fever, arthralgia). Four patients had CTC grade 3 drug related AEs: one decreased lymphocyte count (0.08 mg/kg), one increased gamma glutamyl transferase (0.16 mg/kg), one decreased absolute polys (0.36 mg/kg) and one fatigue (0.36 mg/kg). Enrollment in the phase II portion of the study is ongoing and compares results of patients randomized to receive either 10 mg or 25 mg sc weekly for 24 weeks (equating to effective doses seen in dose escalation).
