    "abstract_text": "Background: MRD status is an established predictive marker for progression-free survival (PFS) in CLL following chemoimmunotherapy as well as for fixed-duration treatment with venetoclax and an anti-CD20 antibody. To date, this relationship has not been explored for the combination of Ibr+Ven, an all-oral, once-daily, fixed-duration treatment with complementary mechanisms of action that work synergistically to eliminate CLL subpopulations in distinct tumor compartments. In the primary analysis of the phase 3 international GLOW trial, independent review committee (IRC)-assessed PFS for Ibr+Ven was superior to Clb+O (hazard ratio, 0.216; p < 0.0001). Herein we further investigate MRD outcomes at the time of the GLOW primary analysis. Methods: GLOW (NCT03462719) enrolled patients (pts) aged \u226565 years or 18-64 years with cumulative illness rating scale score >6 or creatinine clearance <70 mL/min. Pts with del(17p) or known TP53 mutations were excluded. Pts were randomized 1:1, stratified by IGHV mutational and del(11q) status, to Ibr+Ven (3 cycles of ibrutinib lead-in, followed by 12 cycles of Ibr+Ven) or 6 cycles of Clb+O. The primary end point was PFS assessed by IRC and rate of undetectable MRD (uMRD; <10 -4 ) was a secondary end point; additional MRD analyses reported here are exploratory. MRD samples were collected for responders every 3-4 months in peripheral blood (PB) and at Months 9 and 18 in bone marrow (BM). MRD was evaluated using next-generation sequencing (NGS; clonoSEQ) and 8-color flow cytometry. PB/BM concordance was calculated for pts with uMRD in PB at end of treatment plus 3 months (EOT+3) who had a paired BM sample. Analysis of PFS by MRD status includes pts with known MRD status at EOT+3 and no prior progression, death, or withdrawal. Results: 106 pts were randomized to Ibr+Ven and 105 to Clb+O. Median age was 71.0 years, 51.7% had confirmed unmutated (u)IGHV, 18.0% had del(11q), and 4.3% had a TP53 mutation. Median follow-up was 27.7 (range, 1.7-33.8) months. MRD results are all via NGS and reported for EOT+3 unless otherwise noted. MRD Results at 10 -4 : Rate of uMRD was significantly higher for Ibr+Ven vs Clb+O in BM (51.9% vs 17.1%; p < 0.0001) ( Fig A ) and in PB (54.7% vs 39.0%; p = 0.0259). PB/BM uMRD concordance with Ibr+Ven was 92.9%. In the Ibr+Ven arm, 65.9% (27/41) of pts with a complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi) and 54.9% (28/51) with a partial response achieved uMRD in BM; rates for Clb+O were 33.3% (4/12) and 16.9% (13/77), respectively. BM uMRD rates were higher for Ibr+Ven vs Clb+O across prespecified subgroups, including bulky disease (\u22655 cm), del(11q), and uIGHV . In the Ibr+Ven arm, BM uMRD was higher for uIGHV (58.2%) vs mutated IGHV (44.4%). With Ibr+Ven, 84.5% (49/58) of pts maintained PB uMRD from EOT+3 to EOT+12 vs 29.3% (12/41) with Clb+O. For pts with detectable MRD after Ibr+Ven (n = 30), MRD levels remained stable for most patients from EOT+3 to EOT+12 ( Fig B ). MRD Results at 10 -5 : Rate of uMRD <10 -5 was higher for Ibr+Ven vs Clb+O in BM (40.6% vs 7.6%) ( Fig A ), including pts with uIGHV (45.5% vs 5.6%). With Ibr+Ven, PB/BM uMRD concordance at <10 -5 was 90.9% (40/44). Among pts with uMRD <10 -4 in the Ibr+Ven arm, the majority achieved <10 -5 in PB (79.3%) and BM (78.2%), including pts with uIGHV. uMRD <10 -5 in PB was largely sustained from EOT+3 to EOT+12 with Ibr+Ven (80.4% [37/46] of pts) but not Clb+O (26.3% [5/19] of pts) ( Fig B ). PFS by MRD Status at 10 -4 : In the Ibr+Ven arm, PFS rate during the first 12 months after EOT was >90% for pts with uMRD as well as pts with detectable MRD. In contrast, pts in the Clb+O arm with detectable MRD in PB relapsed more quickly than those with uMRD ( Fig C ). PFS trends were similar according to MRD status in BM ( Fig D ). Note that not all pts in the Ibr+Ven arm had 12 months' follow-up post-EOT. Conclusion: All-oral, once-daily, fixed-duration Ibr+Ven demonstrated superior uMRD responses that were deeper and better sustained post-treatment vs Clb+O in elderly or unfit pts with previously untreated CLL. Most pts with uMRD in the Ibr+Ven arm, including those with uIGHV, achieved clearance below 10 -5 , and deeper clearance in PB was mirrored in BM. In the Ibr+Ven arm, clinical relapse was infrequent during the first year off treatment for pts with known MRD status at EOT+3 (whether uMRD or detectable MRD), supported by largely sustained uMRD/MRD levels over the same period. Additional follow-up will be important to confirm these early results.
