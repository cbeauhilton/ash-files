    "abstract_text": "Introduction Frontline NIL continues to show benefit over IM in pts with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) CML-CP, with higher rates of major molecular response (MMR; BCR-ABL IS \u2264 0.1%) and MR 4.5 (BCR-ABL IS \u2264 0.0032%), lower rates of progression to accelerated phase (AP)/blast crisis (BC) and fewer new BCR-ABL mutations on treatment in the Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials\u2013Newly Diagnosed Pts (ENESTnd) trial. Here, we report data with a minimum follow-up (f/u) of 4 y; updated data based on 5 y of f/u will be presented. Methods Adults with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP (N = 846) were randomized to NIL 300 mg twice daily (BID; n = 282), NIL 400 mg BID (n = 281), or IM 400 mg once daily (QD; n = 283). Progression and overall survival (OS) events were collected prospectively during study f/u, including after discontinuation of study treatment. Efficacy in the NIL 300 mg BID and IM arms was evaluated based on achievement of EMR (BCR-ABL IS \u2264 10% at 3 mo). Results At 4 y, \u2265 87% of pts remained on study in each arm and 57%-69% remained on core treatment ( Table ). Rates of MMR and MR 4.5 by 4 y were significantly higher with NIL vs IM. Significantly fewer pts progressed to AP/BC on NIL vs IM (on core treatment: 0.7%, 1.1%, and 4.2%; on study: 3.2%, 2.1%, and 6.7% [NIL 300 mg BID, NIL 400 mg BID, and IM arms, respectively]). Of 17 pts across the 3 arms who progressed on core treatment, 11 (65%) had never achieved complete cytogenetic response and none had achieved MR 4.5 . Fewer mutations have emerged in the NIL arms vs the IM arm; in y 4, mutations emerged in 2 pts (1 pt with T315I on NIL 300 mg BID; 1 pt with F317L on IM). More pts achieved EMR in the NIL 300 mg BID arm vs the IM arm (91% vs 67%). Pts with EMR had significantly higher rates of progression-free survival (PFS) and OS at 4 y vs pts with BCR-ABL > 10% at 3 mo. Among pts with BCR-ABL > 10% at 3 mo, more progressions to AP/BC occurred in the IM arm (n = 14) vs the NIL 300 mg BID arm (n = 2); half of these pts progressed between 3 and 6 mo. In pts with intermediate or high Sokal risk, PFS and OS at 4 y were higher in both NIL arms vs the IM arm. Table.  . NIL 300 mg BID(n = 282) . NIL 400 mg BID (n = 281) . IM 400 mg QD (n = 283) .

View Large No new safety signals were detected. Selected cardiac and vascular events were more common on NIL vs IM (by 4 y, peripheral arterial occlusive disease [PAOD] in 4 [1.4%], 5 [1.8%], and 0 pts; ischemic heart disease [IHD] in 11 [3.9%], 14 [5.1%,] and 3 [1.1%] pts; and ischemic cerebrovascular events in 3 [1.1%], 5 [1.8%], and 1 [0.4%] pts in the NIL 300 mg BID, NIL 400 mg BID, and IM arms, respectively). In the NIL 300 mg BID arm, 2 of 11 IHD events occurred between 3 and 4 y (all 4 PAOD events occurred in the first 2 y). In the NIL 400 mg BID arm, 2 of 5 PAOD events and 3 of 14 IHD events occurred between 3 and 4 y. Most pts (7 of 9) with a PAOD event on NIL were at high risk due to a combination of baseline risk factors. Conclusions NIL, a standard-of-care frontline therapy option for newly diagnosed CML-CP pts, affords superior efficacy compared with IM, including higher rates of EMR (which is associated with improved long-term outcomes), higher rates of MR 4.5 (a key eligibility criterion for many studies of treatment-free remission), and a lower risk of disease progression. NIL continues to show good tolerability with long-term f/u. While selected cardiac and vascular events (including PAOD) are slightly more frequent on NIL vs IM, no increase in annual incidence of these events over time has been observed.
