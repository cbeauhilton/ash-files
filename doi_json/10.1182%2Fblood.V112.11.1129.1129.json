    "abstract_text": "Trisomy 8 (+8) is one of the most common chromosomal abnormality encountered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), occurring in about 10 to 15% of cases. Currently, data assessing specifically the role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allogeneic-HSCT) in the setting of AML with +8 are still relatively sparse. The aim of this multicenter retrospective analysis was to perform a survey on overall outcomes after allogeneic-HSCT of AML patients harboring +8 as a sole chromosomal abnormality or associated with other abnormalities. We have identified 182 de novo AML patients who underwent allogeneic-HSCT between 1990 and 2007 exhibiting isolated +8 (n=136) or +8 associated to other favorable (n=8), intermediate (n=30), high-risk (n=7) or unknown (n=1) group cytogenetics reported to the EBMT. Median age was 37 years. At transplant 108 (59%) patients were in first complete remission (CR). The donor was HLA identical sibling in 115 (63%) and peripheral blood HSCT was used in 54% (n=98). Conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 82%. With a median follow-up of 48 months, 5-year non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse rate (RR), LFS and OS were 25%, 30%, 45% and 47%, respectively. Five-years OS and LFS was not significantly different between AML patients with isolated or associated +8 (44% vs. 56% P=0.14 and 41% vs. 55%, P=0.11). In a multivariate analysis, LFS rate was improved when patients were female and transplanted in CR with an HLA identical sibling donor. LFS rate were 62% and 64% when using an HLA identical sibling donor in patients in CR1 and CR2/CR3, respectively. Isolated or associated +8 were not a risk factor for any outcomes (OS, LFS, RR, NRM). We conclude that allo-HSCT, from an HLA identical sibling donor, appears to be the treatment of choice for AML patients in CR at transplant with isolated or associated +8.",
