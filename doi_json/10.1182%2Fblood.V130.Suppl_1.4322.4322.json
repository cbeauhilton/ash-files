    "abstract_text": "In this study, we analyzed the changes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in symptomatic, relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients (pts) during long-term treatment with the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. Peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected before start of treatment with ibrutinib (420 mg/day p.o.) and at week (wk) 4, 10, 16, 22 and at 8, 12 and 24 months (mo) of treatment. Flow-cytometry analyses of PBMC included CLL cells, Natural Killer (NK) cells, T-cell memory subsets, helper subpopulations (Ths) and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Eleven pts were included in the study, 8 males and 3 females; median age was 73 years. Nine age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were included as controls. Eight pts were still on ibrutinib treatment after 24 mo; for the remaining 3 pts, the last follow-up time was 12 mo. Eight pts had high-risk and 3 intermediate disease according to the modified Rai staging system; 8/11 had 17p deletion. The median lymphocyte count at study entry was 45 x 10 9 /L (range 3.1-109.5). Median number of previous treatment regimens was 1 (range 1-4). All but 2 pts stayed on full-dose ibrutinib during the whole treatment period. In the remaining 2 pts, the dose was decreased to 280 mg/day after approximately 1 year of treatment due to toxicity. In 9/11 pts, the number of CLL cells initially increased at wk 4 compared to baseline (p=0.03); then a gradual reduction occurred during treatment and became significant at wk 16 (p=0.005). At baseline, CLL pts had significantly higher absolute numbers of CD3 + and CD8 + cells compared to healthy controls. CD3 + normalized (i.e. reached values not significantly different from healthy individuals) by wk 10. In contrast to previously published data (Long M et al, J Clin Invest 2017), we observed that CD8 + T cell numbers started to decrease at wk 10 and were normalized by 12 mo. CD4 + T cells, which were at start of treatment non-significantly different from healthy, also gradually decreased in 9/11 pts from wk 16 reaching by 24 mo levels below normal (p=0.02) (Fig.1A). At 24 mo of follow-up, CD4 + cell numbers had decreased in 7/8 evaluable pts; the median reduction vs baseline was 59% (range 3-92%). Among the helper subsets, Th1 (CCR6 - / CXCR3 + ) cells, which at baseline were higher compared to healthy (p=0.0003), normalized by 12 mo, while Th2 (CCR6 - / CXCR3 - ) cells, at baseline non-significantly different from healthy, decreased below normal levels at 12 mo (p=0.006). Th17 (CCR6 + / CXCR3 - ) cells, lower than in healthy controls at baseline (p=0.04), remained unchanged (Fig. 1B). Tregs (CD4 + /CD25 + / CCR4 + /CD127 low ) and NK cells remained also unchanged. The surface expression of PD-1 and intracellular CTLA-4, which was significantly higher at baseline in pts compared to healthy controls in both CD4 + and CD8 + cells, decreased also gradually. In the CD4 + subset, PD-1 expression normalized by 24 mo, while in the CD8 + subset already at 12 mo (Fig.2A). The expression of CTLA-4 normalized in CD4 + cells only by wk 22 (Fig.2B). Proliferating (Ki67 + ) cells, which at baseline were higher in pts compared to controls both in CD4 + and CD8 + cells, also normalized at wk 10 and 12 mo, respectively (Fig.2C). The distribution of the CD4 + and CD8 + memory cell subsets, abnormal at baseline, normalized as well by 12 mo. In conclusion, these data indicate that ibrutinib treatment gradually led to normalization of T-cell counts in CLL patients. Down-regulation of immune checkpoints and cell proliferation markers also occurred, which paralleled the reduction of tumour burden. Moreover, the CD4 + T-cell counts gradually reached levels significantly lower than normal. This reduction affected both the Th1 and Th2 helper populations. The possible clinical implications remain to be shown during extended therapy.
