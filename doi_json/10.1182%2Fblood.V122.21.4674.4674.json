    "abstract_text": "X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA; OMIM 301300) is one of the most common inherited sideroblastic anemia, which results from mutations in the erythroid-specific isozyme of 5-aminolevulinate synthase. An amino acid (AA) substitution for arginine at the 452 AA position of the ALAS2 protein is the most frequent mutation, which has been found in approximately one-quarter of patients with XLSA. Here we first report a 3-generation pedigree including 10 individuals with a K156E substitution in ALAS2 gene in China. A 34 year-old man, complained with a microcytic anemia (hemoglobin (Hb) 84 g/dl, MCV 63.8 fl and MCH 16.5pg), increased ferritin serum (3123ng/ml) and transferrin sat (93%), and dyserythropoiesis with 50% of ring sideroblasts (RS) in BM. A diagnosis of XLSA was made. On treatment with 300mg/d pyridoxine and iron chelation therapy with deferoxamine allowed a correction of anemia and reduction of the S-ferritin (1096 ng/ml) in the proband. The peripheral blood samples had been extracted from proband and his family members. All exons containing exon-intron boundaries of ALAS2, SLC25A38 and GLRX5 , the promoter region and intron 8 of ALAS2 were amplified and directly sequenced. He is a heterozygous for ALAS2 K156E substituion. The pedigree of the proband's family is shown in Figure 1 , while hematologic and iron status data for the family members are reported in Table 1 . All 4 heterozygous females from this family showed marginally increased red-cell distribution width (RDW) without phenotypic expression.

Furthermore, early diagnosis of XLSA allows preventing the complications of the iron overload by chelators or by iterative phlebotomies. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
