    "abstract_text": "CD37 is a lineage-specific B-cell antigen that represents an attractive target for immunotherapy in B-cell malignancies, especially in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL). CD37-specific small modular immuno pharmaceutical (CD37-SMIP\u2122) drug is an engineered protein therapeutic directed to the CD37 antigen using a single chain variable region (scFv) linked to a modified human IgG 1 hinge, CH 2, and CH 3 domains. We have previously presented that CD37-SMIP\u2122 drug induces both ADCC and apoptosis against primary CLL cells and B-cell lymphoma cells and therapeutic efficacy was observed in a Raji cell disseminated leukemia xenograft model. Herein, we sought to determine the effector cell type(s) mediating ADCC and explore if agents that deplete NK cell inhibitory T-regulatory cells influence CD37-SMIP\u2122 efficacy. Immunostaining of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CLL patients demonstrated no expression of CD37 on CD3 + T cells, CD16 + or CD56 + NK cells, or CD64 + monocytes whereas CD37 was highly expressed on CD19 + B cells. Using purified human PBMCs as effector cells and Cr-51 labelled CLL B cells as targets, we found the CD37-SMIP\u2122 dependent ADCC was predominantly mediated by NK cells, but not nai\u0308ve or activated monocytes. Consistent with these in-vitro results, the in-vivo therapeutic efficacy of CD37-SMIP\u2122 drug was significantly compromised by depletion of NK cells in the Raji cell disseminated leukemia xenograft SCID mouse model. The median survival time of CD37-SMIP\u2122 treated mice decreased from 51 days (95% CI: 38, 78) to 27 days (95% CI: 25, 37) (p=0.017) with the depletion of NK cells. Consistent with previous studies, ADCC is not diminished by fludarabine, an agent that may deplete T-regulatory cells, suggesting that the anti-CD37 protein and fludarabine might combine for increased efficacy in-vivo . We therefore examined the effect of fludarabine on CD37-SMIP\u2122 in-vitro apoptotic activity. These data demonstrate that direct cell death mediated by CD37-SMIP\u2122 drug (5 ug/mL) synergizes with fludarabine-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, as measured by both the MTT assay and annexin V/PI staining of CLL cells (combination index, CI=0.44). Overall, these data suggest that the CD37-SMIP\u2122 is a promising therapeutic agent against CD37 + B-cell malignancies as either monotherapy or in combination with fludarabine. Further clinical development is warranted to investigate the effect of CD37-SMIP\u2122 drug in CLL and NHL. (SMIP trademark is owned by Trubion Pharmaceuticals).",
