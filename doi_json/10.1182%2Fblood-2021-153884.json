    "abstract_text": "Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are currently in clinical trial to determine their therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We have shown that vitamin C (VitC), an essential micronutrient and co-factor of Ten-Eleven translocation (TET) proteins, enhances AML sensitivity to PARPi, potentially due to an increased dependency on base-excision repair (BER) enzymes needed to remove TET-catalyzed oxidized methylcytosine bases via active DNA demethylation. TET2 is the most frequently mutated TET gene in patients with AML, and vitamin C treatment can mimic genetic restoration of TET2 function, leading to DNA demethylation, differentiation, and leukemia cell death. Whether vitamin C efficacy in combination with PARPi depends on the level of TET2 functional alleles is not yet known and may stratify whether TET2 wild-type or mutant patients should be targeted by vitamin C adjuvant therapy. We have generated primary murine AML-ETO9a+ and MLL-AF9+ leukemia models with Tet2 +/+, Tet2 +/- and Tet2 -/- alleles to determine the Tet2-dependent efficacy of PARPi treatment when combined with vitamin C. Furthermore, we have performed CRISPR gene knockout and drug library screening in human AML cell lines in combination with vitamin C treatment, and tested a panel of 10 AML cell lines with titrating concentrations of PARPi (Olaparib, Talazoparib, Veliparib and Rucaparib) alone or in combination with vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) mimicking physiological to pharmacological in vivo doses. Primary murine AML cells and human cell lines were assayed for colony-forming capacity, differentiation, cell cycling, viability and effects on DNA methylation, levels of oxidized 5-mC and gene expression upon combination treatment in vitro and in vivo . TET2 mutant PDX and primary murine AMLs treated in vivo with L-ascorbate (4g/kg) and Olaparib (50mg/kg) by daily IP injection were also monitored for disease burden, cellular differentiation and survival. Vitamin C is known to drive the TET-catalyzed iterative oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) leading to the formation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5-fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5-caC). We show that VitC-PARPi combination treatment causes an accumulation of oxidized 5-mC intermediates in the AML genome that correlates with increased yH2AX formation in mid-S phase and cell cycle stalling. Vitamin C reduces the IC 50 of Olaparib and Talazoparib by greater than 10-fold in human AML cells lines and primary murine leukemia cells, and treatment in combination promotes myeloid differentiation and blocks colony-forming capacity greater than either alone. In both our in vitro and in vivo studies, Tet2 +/- AML cells exhibit increased sensitivity to vitamin C treatment alone or in combination with PARPi compared to either Tet2 +/+ or Tet2 -/- cells, suggesting that patients with TET2 haploinsufficiency, which represents the majority of TET2 mutant cases, could benefit the most from combined treatment. Our findings confirm that vitamin C can act synergistically with PARPi to block AML cell viability, reduce colony-forming capacity, and decrease leukemia burden in PDX and primary murine leukemia models in a TET2 allelic dose-dependent manner. The combinatorial effect works at clinically relevant concentrations of PARPi, and low-pharmacological doses of vitamin C. These studies suggest that vitamin C can be used as a non-toxic therapeutic adjuvant to PARPi therapy for the treatment of AML.
