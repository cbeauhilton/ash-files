    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3485 Targeted therapies that suppress B cell receptor (BCR) signaling have emerged as promising agents in the treatment of several B cell malignancies. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) plays a key role in promoting B cell proliferation and survival through participation in the BCR signaling pathway and represents a promising new drug target. AVL-292 is a covalent, highly selective, orally active small molecule inhibitor of Btk currently being evaluated in a Phase 1b clinical trial in relapsed, refractory B cell malignancies including Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. AVL-292 forms a covalent bond with Cys481 in Btk and potently inhibits Btk in biochemical (IC 50 < 0.5nM) and cellular assays (EC 50 1\u201310 nM) including anti-IgM stimulation of BCR signaling, B cell proliferation and activation. A quantitative pharmacodynamic assay to determine the level of AVL-292 bonded to Btk in vitro or in vivo was developed and this drug-target engagement by AVL-292 was shown to correlate directly with inhibition of Btk enzyme activity and substrate phosphorylation. To rationally determine the dose and dose frequency of AVL-292 most likely to benefit patients and to reduce the potential for sub-therapeutic dosing in initial oncology patient cohorts, AVL-292 was administered to healthy adult subjects in a double-blind, placebo controlled, single ascending dose study. This study assessed safety, pharmacokinetics, and quantitatively measured Btk protein levels and AVL-292-Btk engagement in freshly isolated peripheral B lymphocytes. In healthy human subjects, AVL-292 was found to be safe and well tolerated following oral administration at dose levels ranging from 0.5\u20137.0 mg/kg. AVL-292 plasma levels and pharmacodynamic measurement of Btk engagement was dose-proportional across cohorts. All subjects that received 1.0 mg/kg AVL-292 achieved >80% Btk engagement and mean peak plasma levels (Cmax 365 ng/mL) of AVL-292 were rapidly achieved (Tmax median 40 min). Subjects receiving 2.0 mg/kg AVL-292 had a mean peak plasma concentration of 542 ng/mL. All subjects demonstrated >84% Btk engagement at this dose, with 5 of 6 subjects achieving >98% drug-target engagement. Although AVL-292 plasma levels declined substantially by 8 hours, Btk engagement persisted throughout 24 hours, demonstrating that covalent inhibition of Btk with AVL-292 enables prolonged duration of activity without high levels of circulating drug. These results suggest that a once daily dosing schedule is sufficient for sustained Btk inhibition. Furthermore, the Btk protein level in circulating B lymphocytes from all study subjects was evaluated and the mean level was found to be 417.7 pg Btk/mg total protein. Interestingly, this finding in normal B cells correlates well with preclinical ex vivo analysis of Btk protein in primary CLL cells where comparable Btk protein levels were found. This suggests that the AVL-292 dose range and schedule identified for complete Btk engagement in this healthy volunteer trial is likely to inform appropriate dose selection in the subsequent phase 1b oncology study, allowing more rapid identification of a safe and clinically effective dose.
