    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by macrocytic anemia, reticulocytopenia, selective deficiency of erythroid precursors, presence of congenital anomalies and an increased risk of cancer. DBA is caused by germline mutations of genes coding for ribosomal proteins (RP). Interestingly, somatic RP mutations have also been found in several malignant diseases (T-ALL, CLL, Hodgkin lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML). The only representative overview of malignancies in DBA was published in 2012 based on the data from the North American DBA Registry. The malignancies developed in 3% of patients (MDS and AML in 4 patients and solid tumors in 15 patients). The observed-to-expected ratio for all cancers combined was 5.4 (p<0.05). Median age at diagnosis was 41 years and cumulative incidence of solid tumors/leukemias was approximately 20% at the age of 46 years. Five years later, additional solid tumors were reported, in particular gastrointestinal tumors, and an incidence of MDS was alarming. Our aim was to evaluate cancer incidence within Czech National DBA Registry and characterize underlying molecular pathology. Patients and methods : Czech National DBA Registry currently includes 62 patients. In cooperation with 8 national centers of pediatric and adult hematology, we collected data about patients followed with pre-malignant or malignant condition including a detailed analysis of the course of the disease, treatment and type of developed malignant disorder. In patients with an evolving MDS, a classical cytogenetic analysis, flow cytometry, mutational profile (TruSight Myeloid Sequencing Panel (Illumina) containing 54 genes) and commercial TUNEL assay for detection of apoptotic changes of erythroid cells in the bone marrow were performed. Results : Eight of 62 patients from the Registry (13%) had malignant or pre-malignant condition: four females (6.5%) had solid tumors, 3 males (4.8%) had MDS and one female (1.6%) had multiple myeloma. Age of the onset of these disorders ranged between 25-70 years. Three patients harbored RPL5 mutation, 3 patients RPL11 mutation and 2 patients RPS19 mutation. Cancer incidence was significantly higher within the RPL11 and RPL5 subgroups (p=0.0056, Fisher Exact Test). Two female patients were diagnosed with triple-negative breast carcinoma, both of them during pregnancy. The first patient died despite treatment at the age of 29 years, shortly after delivery of her second child. The second patient is currently undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. One patient developed diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), underwent chemotherapy and autologous BMT and is alive in second remission. One patient underwent hemicolectomy for colorectal adenocarcinoma at 53 years of age and is in remission 6 years after the surgery. One patient succumbed to multiple myeloma which evolved from monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) after 14 years of follow-up. Three male patients developed suspected MDS at the age of 25, 28 and 29 years. Two of them had RPL5 mutation and one harbored RPS19 mutation. None of them had decrease of erythroid cells in the bone marrow, but apoptosis of erythroid progenitors was significantly increased in all cases. All 3 patients had bicytopenia in peripheral blood (anemia, leukopenia) and dysplasia in 2 or 3 hematopoietic lineages in the bone marrow, thus fulfilling criteria for MDS with multilineage dysplasia (MDS-MLD). They had no abnormalities detected by flow cytometry or cytogenetics. The patient with RPS19 mut harbored ASXL1 mutation; in patient with RPL5 mut , mutational screening is ongoing. Conclusion : Our results confirmed increased incidence of cancer (13%) in patients with DBA at young age. Our cases of DLBCL and MGUS in DBA are the first published to date. In cases with suspected MDS, cytopenia and dysplastic changes in the bone marrow may either reflect specific features of ribosomopathy, or represent a severe disorder of regulatory mechanisms with propensity to clonal proliferation. International collaboration is required to refine the incidence of malignancies in DBA and to issue consensus guidelines for timely detection of solid tumors, leukemias and MDS. The best approach to DBA patients who developed MDS without harboring any mutation considered prognostically significant in MDS, is another subject of discussion.
