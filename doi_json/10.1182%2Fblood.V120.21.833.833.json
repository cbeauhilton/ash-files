    "abstract_text": "Abstract 833 Lipocalin 24p3 (24p3) is a neutrophil secondary granule protein. 24p3 is also a siderocalin, which binds several bacterial siderophores. It was therefore proposed that synthesis and secretion of 24p3 by stimulated macrophages or release of 24p3 upon neutrophil degranulation sequesters iron-laden siderophores to attenuate bacterial growth. Accordingly, 24p3-deficient mice are susceptible to bacterial pathogens whose siderophores are chelated by 24p3. Specific granule deficiency (SGD) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by complete absence of proteins of secondary granules. Neutrophils from SGD patients lack normal functions and are prone to bacterial infections, but the importance of 24p3 for neutrophil dysfunction in SGD is not known. Here we show that neutrophils of 24p3\u2212/\u2212 mice are defective for many neutrophil functions. Specifically, neutrophils in 24p3\u2212/\u2212 mice do not extravasate to sites of infection and are defective for chemotaxis. A transcriptome analysis revealed that genes that control cytoskeletal reorganization are selectively suppressed in 24p3\u2212/\u2212 neutrophils. Additionally, small regulatory RNAs (miRNAs) that control upstream regulators of cytoskeletal proteins are also increased in 24p3\u2212/\u2212 neutrophils. Further, 24p3\u2212/\u2212 neutrophils failed to phagocytose bacteria, which may account for the enhanced sensitivity of 24p3\u2212/\u2212 mice to both intracellular (Listeria monocytogenes) and extracellular (Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus) pathogens. Interestingly, Listeria does not secrete siderophores and additionally, the siderophore secreted by Candida is not sequestered by 24p3. Therefore, the heightened sensitivity of 24p3\u2212/\u2212 mice to these pathogens is not due to sequestration of siderophores to limit the iron availability but as a consequence of impaired neutrophil functions.
