    "abstract_text": "Patients with high-risk essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) are typically managed with cytoreductive agents such as recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1), hydroxyurea (HU), and anagrelide (AG). Despite the significant activity of IFN-\u03b1 in ET and PV, this agent is frequently hindered by poor tolerance and inconvenient dosing schedules. PEG-IFN-\u03b1 is formulated by covalently attaching polymers of ethylene glycol to the native IFN-\u03b1 molecule, resulting in decreased renal excretion and increased serum half-life that allows for weekly administration. On this basis, we are conducting a phase II study of subcutaneous PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a (Pegasys) for patients with ET or PV. A total of 76 patients have been enrolled and treated thus far (36 ET, 40 PV). Median age is 53 years (range, 18\u201377), time from diagnosis to PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a 49 months (range, 0\u2013355), WBC count 8.7\u00d710 9 /L (range, 3.7\u201327.8), hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL (range, 8.9\u201318.8), and platelet count 554\u00d710 9 /L (range, 140\u20131641). Prior therapies (median 1; range 0\u20136) included HU (n=44), AG (n=29), IFN-\u03b1 (n=11: 5 oral and 6 sc), imatinib (n=7), and dasatinib (n=1). PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a was the initial therapy in 13 patients that refused therapy with HU. The JAK2 V617F mutation was detected in 20 (56%) of 36 ET and in 37 (92.5%) of 40 PV patients. Nine (12%) patients had abnormal cytogenetics. Initial starting dose of PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a was 450 mcg/week, but that was modified to the current starting dose of 90 mcg/week. Dose modifications are allowed according to response or toxicity. Patients are currently receiving 450 mcg (n=1), 270 mcg (n=3), 180 mcg (n=14), 135 mcg (n=8), 90 mcg (n=27), and 45 mcg (n=7). After a median follow-up of 23 months (range, 2\u201338), 63 (85%) of 74 assessable patients have responded. The median time to response was 4 weeks (range, 0.5\u201326). Complete response (CR) was achieved by 60 (81%) patients (for ET: platelets <440\u00d710 9 /L, off HU and AG, in the absence of thromboembolic events; for PV: Hb 10% reduction in JAK2 V617F expression, including 14 (34%) who had a >50% reduction. In 5 (11%) of the latter the mutant allele became undetectable. PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a was well tolerated in most patients. Thirty-nine episodes of grade 3\u20134 toxicity were reported: neutropenia (n=15), elevated transaminases (n=5), infection (n=4), fatigue (n=3), pain (n=3), cardiac (n=2), and anemia, thrombocytopenia, depression, shortness of breath, pruritus, thrombosis, and dizziness in 1 case each. Sixteen (21%) patients were taken off study after a median of 8 months (range, 2\u201326) on PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a but only 7 (9%) of them due to due to therapy-related toxicities: grade 3 neutropenia, anorexia, depression, ischemic retinopathy, dyspnea, confusion, and pruritic rash. In conclusion, PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2a therapy results in remarkable clinical activity with an acceptable toxicity profile in advanced, previously treated, patients with ET or PV. Clinical responses are frequently accompanied by significant reduction of JAK2 V617F allele burden, which becomes undetectable in a proportion of them, suggesting selective targeting of the malignant clone."
