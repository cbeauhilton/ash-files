    "abstract_text": "Birinapant (TL32711), a Smac mimetic in clinical testing, potently targets Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs, including cIAPs and XIAP) to unblock intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, enabling caspase-dependent apoptosis via multiple signals. Birinapant also inactivates canonical NF-kB signaling through cIAPs. We investigated the pro-apoptotic effects of birinapant, alone and in combination with bendamustine (BDM), an active lymphoma therapeutic agent, in a panel of B cell lymphoma cell lines representing germinal center/follicular (GC) vs. activated B cell (ABC) subtypes. We hypothesized that the efficacy of this potential combination therapeutic strategy might differ between GC and ABC lymphoma types, as ABC are reported to be NF-kB-dependent. We used the following EBV negative cell lines: WSU-FSCCL t(14:18)+ follicular lymphoma (FL), FC-TxFL2 t(14:18)+ transformed FL, and SU-DHL4 GC-type diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) as examples of GC origin lymphomas. U2932 and TMD8 cell lines represent ABC-type DLBCL.\u00a0 Apoptosis was determined by annexin V staining and confirmed by caspase-3 activation, each assessed by flow cytometric methods following 48 h incubation. Birinapant had little effect (50% annexin V+) of apoptosis induced by 10 uM BDM in WSU-FSCCL and FC-TxFL2, \u00a0and only slightly enhanced the low level of BDM-induced apoptosis in the GC DLBCL cell line DHL-4 (to 10-15%). In the ABC DLBCL cell lines, however, whereas 10uM BDM induced <5% annexin V+ cells for U2932 and 10-15% for TMD8, addition \u00a0of 100 nM birinapant 30-60 minutes prior to 10 uM BDM induced 35-40% annexin V+ cells in each of these ABC-DLBCL cell lines. This enhancement was schedule-dependent, not observed when birinapant was added after BDM. Thus, the cell lines representing FL and transformed FL are sensitive to BDM at clinically-achievable concentrations, without further enhancement by birinapant. The 3 DLBCL lines were relatively insensitive to BDM compared with FL cells, but BDM-induced apoptosis was markedly enhanced when birinapant was added before (but not after) BDM in the 2 ABC type DLBCL lines. Further explorations into the mechanism of birinapant sensitization of ABC-DLBCL to BDM, issues of dose and schedule, and role of NF-kB-dependency are ongoing. These data suggest that therapeutic trials of BDM plus birinapant would be of interest in ABC type DLBCL. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
