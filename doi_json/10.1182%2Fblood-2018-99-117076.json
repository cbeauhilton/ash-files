    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) arise in the embryonic dorsal aorta (DA) through a Runx1-dependent process of endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT). Subsequently, HSPCs colonize secondary niches to proliferate, differentiate and maintain lifelong hematopoiesis. We previously reported that elevated glucose metabolism and sterile inflammatory signaling each stimulate zebrafish HSPC production from hemogenic endothelium. Consistent with the hypothesis that transient metabolic activation induces an inflammatory response to influence HSPC formation, we found that glucose stimulation from 12-36 hours post fertilization (hpf) increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and receptors by quantitative PCR. In particular, morpholino-mediated knockdown of il1b blunted the inductive effects of glucose metabolism on runx1 expression in the DA and numbers of CD41+ HSPCs in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT). In contrast, overexpression of mature il1b increased HSPC numbers as assessed by flow cytometry and runx1/cmyb in situ hybridization. As IL-1\u03b2 is cleaved and activated by the inflammasome, which is a well-known sensor of metabolic stimuli, we treated embryos with validated inflammasome activators, such as nigericin, and found that they also increased runx1/cmyb expression and Flk1+cMyb+ HSPCs. Inflammasome stimulation required NF-\u03baB activity, and upregulated canonical IL-1\u03b2 targets, including IL-6 and IL-8, which have been previously shown by our laboratory to play significant roles in embryonic HSPC formation. Importantly, loss of the inflammasome adapter pycard or effector caspa reduced HSPC numbers, and prevented expansion of the HSPC pool in response to glucose stimulation. In further support of a role for sterile inflammatory activity in regulating HSPC number downstream of metabolic activation, we found that inflammasome-mediated IL-1\u03b2 action bypassed the suppressive effect of antioxidant treatment on runx1/cmyb expression in the DA. Conversely, inflammasome inhibition partially blocked effects of metabolism-associated HIF1\u03b1 activation on runx1/cmyb expression, indicating that the inflammasome acts downstream of reactive-oxygen-species (ROS) generation and HIF1\u03b1 activation to promote HSPC production and/or expansion from hemogenic endothelium. Inflammasome components are highly expressed in myeloid cells; targeted knockdown and cell ablation studies indicate that macrophages are necessary to mediate the effects of inflammasome stimulation on HSPC numbers in the CHT at 72hpf. Interestingly, prolonged inflammasome stimulation also expands myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, as cmyb, rag1 and mpo expression were each elevated at 120hpf; increased numbers of Rag2+ and Mpo+ cells were confirmed by flow cytometry. To determine whether the effects of inflammasome activation were conserved in higher vertebrates, we induced inflammasome activation during differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) into hematopoietic progenitors. In this system, nigericin treatment of iPSC-derived hemogenic endothelial cells yielded an increased frequency of functional colony-forming units by day 7 of EHT culture. Taken together, inflammasome-mediated IL-1\u03b2 action appears to serve as an integrator of metabolic activity, downstream of ROS/ HIF1\u03b1, to promote HSPC formation and development of myeloid and lymphoid lineages in vivo and in vitro. These studies identify the inflammasome as a promising target to promote human HSPC production from iPSCs for therapeutic purposes. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
