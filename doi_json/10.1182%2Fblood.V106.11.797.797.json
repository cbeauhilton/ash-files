    "abstract_text": "Recently, we have successfully identified human cord blood (CB)-derived CD34-negative (CD34 \u2212 ) severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-repopulating cells (SRCs) with extensive lymphoid and myeloid repopulating ability using the intra-bone marrow injection (IBMI) method ( Blood  101 : 2924 , 2003 ). These CD34 \u2212 SRCs could home into the BM niche only by IBMI, because they expressed lower levels of homing receptors including CXCR4. These CD34 \u2212 SRCs did not express CD38 as well as c-kit. It is well documented that the tyrosine kinase receptors c-kit and flt3 are expressed and function in early mouse and human hematopoiesis. In murine model, it was reported that Lin \u2212 CD34 \u2212 Sca \u2212 1 + c-kit + flt3 \u2212 cells supported long-term multilineage hematopoietic reconstitution. In contrast, Lin \u2212 CD34 \u2212 Sca-1 + c-kit + flt3 + cells are progenitors for the common lymphoid progenitor. More recently, these Lin \u2212 CD34 \u2212 Sca-1 + c-kit + flt3 + hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been revealed to lack erythro-megakaryocytic potential. In this study, we have investigated the function of flt3 in our identified human CB-derived CD34 \u2212 SRCs. First, we studied the SRC activity of CB-derived Lin - CD34 + Flt3 +/\u2212 or CD34 \u2212 Flt3 +/\u2212 cells using IBMI. Both CD34 + FLT3 +/\u2212 cells repopulated all 13 recipient mice. The level of human CD45 + cells in murine BMs received transplants of CD34 + Flt3 + cells (29.3~90.8%, median 62.8%) was higher than those received transplants of CD34 + Flt3 \u2212 cells (9.8~45.1%, median 17.7%). On the other hand, only CD34 \u2212 Flt3 \u2212 cells repopulated all 7 recipient mice and the level of human CD45 + cells in murine BMs was 11.7~63.3% (median 37.9%). To further evaluate the long-term repopulating potential of these three populations, including CD34 + Flt3 +/\u2212 and CD34 \u2212 Flt3 \u2212 cells, BM cells obtained from each primary recipient mice were accessed for their SRC activities by secondary transplantation by IBMI. While CD34 + Flt3 + cells did not show secondary repopulating activity, CD34 + Flt3 \u2212 cells could repopulate 83% (5/6) of secondary recipients. Moreover, CD34 \u2212 Flt3 \u2212 cells did repopulate all 5 secondary recipient mice with higher repopulating rate. Next, we cocultured CD34 \u2212 Flt3 \u2212 cells with the murine stromal cell line, HESS-5 in the presence of SCF, TPO, IL-3, IL-6, and G-CSF. After one week, significant numbers of CD34 + Flt3 \u2212 and CD34 + Flt3 + cells were generated. Then we sorted these two populations, CD34 + Flt3 +/\u2212 cells, and tested their SRC activities by IBMI. Seven out of 10 and 5 out of 10 mice received CD34 + Flt3 +/\u2212 cells were repopulated with human cells, respectively. These results indicated that human CB-derived Lin \u2212 CD34 \u2212 Flt3 \u2212 cells produced CD34 + Flt3 \u2212 as well as CD34 + Flt3 + SRCs in vitro. Our present study has demonstrated that human CB-drived CD34 \u2212 SRCs do not express Flt3 tyrosine kinase receptor as did murine CD34 \u2212 KSL cells. Based on these data, we propose that the immunophenotype of very primitive long-term repopulating human HSC is Lin \u2212 CD34 \u2212 CD38 \u2212 c-kit - Flt3 \u2212 ."
