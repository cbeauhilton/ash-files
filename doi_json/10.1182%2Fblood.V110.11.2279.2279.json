    "abstract_text": "PURPOSE: Although the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to improvements in the management of AIDS-associated Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (KS), KS may persist or progress despite HAART. It has been hypothesized that activation of KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, HHV8) lytic expression might render tumor cells susceptible to immune surveillance by cytotoxic T cells. Alternatively, it has been suggested that lytic induction could lead to tumor progression. In vitro, valproic acid (VA) and other histone deacetylase inhibitors induce KSHV lytic gene expression in primary effusion lymphoma cell lines. We investigated VA in AIDS/KS patients to assess its safety and its impact on lytic viral gene expression in tumor and viral copy number in blood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: VA was given orally to patients with AIDS and cutaneous KS on stable antiviral regimens; the dose was titrated to maintain trough concentrations between 50 and 100 mcg/mL. VA was given daily for 28 days followed by a rapid taper and patients were then followed for 6 months. Quantitative real time PCR was used to assess viral DNA in plasma and PBMC, and viral RNA in tumor specimens. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess viral antigen expression in tumor specimens. RESULTS: 18 patients were treated. 15/18 patients completed therapy; 3 patients discontinued therapy early, one secondary to grade 2 toxicity and 2 to patient preference. One patient showed a partial response and 17 showed stable disease at the completion of therapy. No patients progressed during treatment. There were no differences between KSHV copy number in plasma or PBMC before, during, or after therapy. Similarly, although serial biopsies in some patients showed an increase in lytic gene expression, these changes did not achieve statistical significance. However, in multivariate analyses, viral lytic RNA increased in tumor biopsies on day 8 as a function of VA level. There was no change in HIV viral load with VA treatment. CONCLUSION : VA was well tolerated in AIDS patients, was not associated with accelerated disease progression, but rarely induced tumor regression after short-term treatment. In patients who achieved the highest serum VA levels there was increased lytic viral RNA expression. These findings support investigation of more potent HDAC inhibitors over longer treatment courses in patients with AIDS-associated KS."
