    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4442 Purpose For hemophiliacs gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a life-threatening complication and can be caused by the Helicobacter pylori infection. In this study, the prevalence of H. pylori infection among child hemophiliacs with gastrointestinal hemorrhage and the recurrence rate after eradication H. pylori treatment was investigated. Patients and Methods Seven children with hemophilia A with hematemesis (age, 5.3\u223c17.0 year) were evaluated for the causes of gastrointestinal hemorrhage and the detection of H. pylori. Gastroendoscopy was done to find the bleeding focus and for further evaluation including rapid urease test and mucosal biopsy. Result : Four patients had dyspepsia and abdominal pain for several weeks or months prior to hematemesis. Three patients did not show any signs of bleeding. From gastroendoscopy, four patients were diagnosed as duodenal ulcer, one as H. pylori associated chronic gastritis and one as hemorrhagic gastritis. One patient showing a normal finding was diagnosed with adenoid hemorrhage after nasopharyngoscopy. H. pylori infection was found in four of six patients with GI bleeding (3, duodenal ulcer; 1, H. pylori associated chronic gastritis). The patients with H. pylori infection had an eradication treatment of triple therapy and no recurrence happened. Conclusion In child hemophiliacs, H. pylori should also be considered as an important cause of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The recurrence of the infection and gastrointestinal hemorrhage can be prevented with eradication of H. pylori. Screening test for H. pylori would be needed in child hemophiliacs in endemic area.
