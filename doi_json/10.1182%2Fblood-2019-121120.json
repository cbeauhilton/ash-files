    "abstract_text": "CAR T cells have shown remarkable outcomes when targeting specific hematologic cancers. But targeting solid cancers has proven difficult: it is difficult to identify unique antigens, to traffic to tumors, and to mount a strong response in the solid tumor microenvironment. To overcome these issues, we are using the approaches of synthetic biology to engineer next-generation T cells. We are engineering cells that utilize new sets of sensors and modular control circuits that enable them to execute new recognition and response programs with higher precision and robustness. These new capabilities may allow us to develop therapeutic T cells that are far more effective and safe against solid tumors.
