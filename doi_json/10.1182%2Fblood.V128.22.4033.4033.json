    "abstract_text": "Background Patients with FLT3-ITD mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have generally poor survival. Recent update of ECOG trial comparing standard- vs . high-dose daunorubicin showed that daunorubicin dose intensification improved survival in AML with FLT3-ITD mutants (Blood 2016;127:1551). In subgroup analysis of our previous randomized trial, high-dose daunorubicin seemed to be more effective than idarubicin in AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutants (ASH abstract No. 2535, 2015). In this retrospective investigation, we aimed to evaluate the role of daunorubicin dose intensification for induction therapy in AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutants who were treated at a single institute. Methods We analyzed data from 120 patients of newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD mutated AML patients who received induction chemotherapy between January 2002 and March 2016. The regimens consisted of high-dose daunorubicin (HD-DN, 90 mg/m 2 /d x 3d, n=39), standard-dose daunorubicin (SD-DN, 45 mg/m 2 /d x 3d, n=48), or idarubicin (IDA, 12 mg/m 2 /d x 3d, n=33) in combination with cytarabine (200 mg/m 2 /d x 7d). Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were not included. Results After the first round of induction chemotherapy, 53 patients had persistent leukemia; 50 received the second round of induction chemotherapy consisting of daunorubicin (45 mg/m 2 /d x 2d) or idarubicin (8 mg/ m 2 /d x 2d) in addition to cytarabine (200 mg/m 2 /d x 5d) and 3 received other regimens. A total of 81 patients achieved CR, and the CR rates were 76.9%, 58.3%, and 69.7% in HD-DN, SD-DN, and IDA, respectively ( P =0.175). The 4-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) of these 81 patients was 48.8%. With the median follow-up duration of survivors of 59.9 months (range, 4.6-170.7), 4-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 57.1%/27.7%/35.7% ( P =0.025) and 45.2%/23.9%/36.0% ( P =0.042) in HD-DN, SD-DN, and IDA, respectively. HD-DN showed statistically higher OS (hazard ration [HR], 0.424; P =0.005) and EFS (HR, 0.497; P =0.01), and lower CIR ( P =0.036) than SD-DN, while OS and EFS differences between HD-DN and IDA were not statistically significant. Conclusion Daunorubicin dose intensification for induction therapy seemed to be effective in AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutants. Further studies are needed to investigate whether HD-DN is superior to IDA in this population. Considering high relapse rate, combination strategies of daunorubicin dose intensification and targeted agents such as FLT3 inhibitors should be developed.
