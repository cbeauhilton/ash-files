    "abstract_text": "The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) microenvironment, termed the niche, supports the proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation abilities of HSCs. The definitive HSCs emerge from the hemogenic endothelium in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region after E11.5, and then migrate to the fetal liver after E12.5 for expansion. After E17.5, HSCs migrate to the bone marrow and reside in the bone marrow for the postnatal stage and adulthood. Because the fetal liver is thought to be a harbor for the rapid expansion of HSCs, numerous studies have focused on the fetal liver HSC niche in the search for novel niche factors and niche cells that support HSC expansion. However, to our knowledge, there are no successes in translating the niche factors to a clinical application for the expansion of HSCs ex vivo . In this study, we are using cutting-edge spatial transcriptomics to comprehensively study the transcriptomics and interactions between HSCs and the niche cells in the fetal liver, and in search of the niche cells and factors for HSC expansion. To understand the spatial distribution and interactions between HSCs and niche cells in the fetal liver, we introduced 2 spatial transcriptomic methods, slide-seq, and 10x Visium, in our study on E14.5 mouse fetal liver. By integrating with a parallel single-cell sequencing analysis, we revealed the spatial transcriptomics of HSCs and potential niche cells, including hepatoblasts, endothelium cells, macrophages, megakaryocytes, and hepatic stellate cells/perivascular mesenchymal cells (PMCs) in E14.5 mouse fetal liver. Interestingly, we found that the PMCs were characterized by enriched N-cadherin expression. Both slide-seq and 10x Visium showed that the N-cadherin-expressing PMCs are enriched in the portal vessel area. Importantly, the majority of fetal liver HSCs are in close proximity to N-cadherin-expressing PMCs, indicating a supportive role of N-cadherin-expressing PMCs in HSC maintenance. Subsequent CellPhoneDB (CPDB) analysis demonstrated that the N-cadherin-expressing PMCs are major niche-signaling senders with an enriched expression of niche factors, such as CXCL12 and KITL, and stemness pathway-related ligands, such as IGF1, IGF2, TGF\u03b22, TGF\u03b23, JAG2, and DLK1, indicating N-cadherin-expressing PMCs could be the major niche cells in supporting HSCs in the fetal liver. This finding was consistent with our previous finding that N-cadherin-expressing bone and marrow stromal progenitor cells can maintain reserve HSCs in the adult bone marrow. Moreover, CPDB analysis indicated that other potential niche cells, such as endothelium cells, macrophages, and megakaryocytes, may support HSCs in different signal transduction pathways. For example, endothelium cells have an enriched expression of KITL, IGF2, DLL1, TGF\u03b21, and TGF\u03b22; macrophages have enriched expression of KITL, IFN\u03b3, and TGF\u03b21; megakaryocytes have enriched expression of PF4, JAG2 and TGF\u03b21. Intriguingly, our previous studies showed that megakaryocytes could promote HSC expansion under stress conditions in the bone marrow. To investigate the potential role of N-cadherin-expressing cells in supporting fetal liver HSCs, we generated an N-cad CreER ;Cxcl12 and an N-cad CreER ;Scf mouse model to conditionally knockout the well-studied niche factors, CXCL12 and SCF, in N-cadherin-expressing cells. Conditional knockout of either Cxcl12 or Scf in N-cadherin-expressing cells resulted in an increase in the number of HSCs. Moreover, conditional knockout of Cxcxl12 in N-cadherin-expressing cells also resulted in a myeloid-biased differentiation. We postulate that the knockout of Cxcl12 or Scf in N-cadherin-expressing cells leads to the migration of HSCs towards other potential niche cells, such as macrophages and megakaryocytes, which may induce HSC expansion and biased differentiation. In summary, by using cutting-edge spatial transcriptomics, we revealed a comprehensive spatial transcriptomics of HSCs and niche cells in E14.5 mouse fetal liver. The N-cadherin-expressing cells in the fetal liver is a major niche in maintaining HSCs, while other potential niches may be responsible for the expansion of HSCs. In the future, we will use multiple approaches, such as spatial transcriptomics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), to verify the distribution changes of HSCs in N-cad CreER ;Cxcl12 mouse, and to reveal the niches in support of the expansion of HSCs.
