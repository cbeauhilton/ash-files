    "abstract_text": "Sodium ion binding regulates allosterically the pro- and anti-coagulant functions of the central coagulation serine proteinase, thrombin (T). The conversion of the prothrombin (ProT) zymogen into T results in expression of the fibrinogen (Fbg) recognition site (exosite I) and may facilitate binding of a single Na + . Na + binding stabilizes the \u201cfast\u201d form of T that mediates the efficient conversion of Fbg into fibrin. The \u201cslow\u201d form of T, lacking Na + , shows decreased Fbg substrate activity and slightly enhanced activity towards activation of protein C, which results in a net increase in the anticoagulant activity of T ( Di Cera et al., 1995 ). Conversion of protein C to activated protein C results in cleavage and inactivation of factor Va and VIIIa, which inhibits reactions central to hemostasis. Staphylocoagulase (SC), a conformational activator of ProT, binds ProT with high affinity through proexosite I and imparts T-like activity to the zymogen-activator complex. To determine whether the Na + binding site is present on the SC-(1-325)\u00b7ProT complex, kinetic studies in the presence and absence of Na + were performed, using the non-interacting cation, choline to maintain constant ionic strength. Results indicate that indeed Na + binds to the SC-(1-325)\u00b7ProT complex with a K D of 17 \u00b1 2 mM and causes an ~7-fold increase in the activity of SC-(1-325)\u00b7ProT complex toward a T-specific tripeptide chromogenic substrate. The chromogenic substrate activity of mouse ProT\u00b7SC-(1-325), unlike the human zymogen, was independent of Na + , consistent with the recent finding that mouse T lacks a functional Na + binding site ( Bush et al., 2006 ). Fbg clotting studies indicated that human T has 24-fold increased clotting activity in the presence of Na + , and the SC-(1-325)\u00b7T complex has 13-fold enhanced activity. Surprisingly, much unlike the results obtained from the chromogenic substrate studies, the Fbg clotting activity of the SC-(1-325)\u00b7ProT human complex was less dependent on the presence of Na + , as indicated by a 4.1-fold increase in clotting activity for the complex in the presence of Na + . Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the functional significance of the Na + binding site on the SC\u00b7ProT complex and its effect on Fbg recognition and cleavage."
