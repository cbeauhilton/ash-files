Methods: An online survey was conducted from a nationally representative patient panel in 1Q2011. All respondents were \u226518 years and diagnosed with cancer by a physician. Participants were asked about their blood transfusion history, information seeking behaviors, and knowledge about blood transfusion. Results: 206 individuals responded to survey. 65% (n=133) were female and 25% (n=52) were over 55 years. 55% (n=114) were anemic and 45% (n=92) not anemic. 62% (n=128) had received blood transfusion, whereas, 38% (n=78) had no transfusions. Top two sources of information are doctor (85%) and Internet (78%). Among those previously transfused, 74% received right amount of information, whereas, 11% received too little information, and 15% received too much information. More than 90% of transfused indicated they knew the reasons for and benefits of getting a blood transfusion. Less than two-thirds received information about the costs. Over 65% of not transfused said that it is extremely important to know risks of infections, right blood type and screening techniques. Among previously transfused, about 70% agreed that they made an informed choice about receiving blood transfusions. Among the previously transfused, 78% agree that they knew the benefits compared with 68% not transfused. About 68% of transfused and not transfused agree they knew the risks of blood transfusion. Conclusions: Doctor's office and internet are primary sources of information about blood transfusions. Gaps in knowledge exist about benefits, risks, and costs of blood transfusions. A significant number feel that they need more information about blood transfusion to make an informed choice. Providers should consider adopting shared-decision making with their patients.
