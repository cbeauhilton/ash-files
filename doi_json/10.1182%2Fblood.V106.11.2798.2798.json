    "abstract_text": "Probably through inhibition of histone deacetylases, VPA \u00b1 ATRA has been associated with clinical responses in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or AML (Kuendgen, Blood 2004; Raffoux, Haematologica 2005). Interestingly, VPA/ATRA-induced differentiation of AML cells has been documented in vivo (Nervi, ASH 2004 #1805). On the other hand, the combination of VPA with a demethylating agent synergistically enhances its antileukemia activity in vitro (Yang, Leukemia Res 2005). In a pilot phase, we treated 5 high-risk AML patients with a sequential combination of 5-azacytidine, VPA, and ATRA. Each treatment cycle comprised 75 mg/m 2 /d 5-azacytidine SC from day 1 to 7, 20 mg/kg/d VPA (then adapted on serum concentration) from day 1 to 28, and 45 mg/m 2 /d ATRA from day 8 to 28. Six cycles were planned, each starting at day 29 of the previous one whatever the hematological status. High-risk AML (AML-M3 excluded) was defined as: previously untreated de novo or post-MDS AML in patients aged 65+ unfit for intensive chemotherapy; or post-MDS AML in first relapse or AML in second or subsequent relapse. Eligibility criteria also comprised WBC<30 G/L, PS<2, no severe infection, liver enzyme levels \u2264 2xULN, and serum creatinine \u2264 1.5xULN. Main patient characteristics and response are indicated in the Table below:  Patient . Age . AML . Prior Tx . BM blasts . Cycles . Response . Time to response . #1 71y post-MDS 4 41% 6 CRp 4 cycles #2 73y post-MDS 0 28% 6 CR 4 cycles #3 76y de novo  2 62% 2 Progression \u2013 #4 68y post-MDS 0 26% 2 Stable \u2013 #5 55y de novo  2 20% 4+ AML-free 3 cycles Patient . Age . AML . Prior Tx . BM blasts . Cycles . Response . Time to response . #1 71y post-MDS 4 41% 6 CRp 4 cycles #2 73y post-MDS 0 28% 6 CR 4 cycles #3 76y de novo  2 62% 2 Progression \u2013 #4 68y post-MDS 0 26% 2 Stable \u2013 #5 55y de novo  2 20% 4+ AML-free 3 cycles View Large Patient #3 progressed after the 2 nd cycle. Treatment was also discontinued after the 2 nd cycle in patient #4, because of ovarian carcinoma diagnosis. Response was observed after at least 3 cycles in the 3 remaining patients (1 CR, 1 CRp, 1 AML-free state with platelet count normalization), all treated as out-patients. Safety profile was excellent (no significant treatment-induced cytopenia). Main side effects were pain at 5-azacytidine injection sites and constipation. This treatment approach appearing promising in terms of efficacy versus toxicity, a formal multicenter Phase 2 study has been initiated.",
