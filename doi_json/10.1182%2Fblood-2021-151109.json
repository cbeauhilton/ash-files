    "abstract_text": "Background . Anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells represent a major therapeutic advance in the management of patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory aggressive large B-cell lymphoma (R/R aggressive LBCL) with reported overall response rates between 40% and 83% in the pivotal trials (ZUMA1, JULIET, TRANSCEND) as well as in the real-life cohorts with either axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel, Yescarta) or tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel, Kymriah). However, a significant number of pts will experience failure after infusion, 20% to 35% of these failures occurring early during the first month. Lenalidomide is reported to activate CD8 T-cells, to inhibit regulatory T-cells and to restore T-cell immune synapse. Here, we report our experience with early exposure to Lenalidomide (LEN) in the treatment of early failure (<15 days) after axi-cel or tisa-cel for R/R aggressive LBCL. Methods . Between June 2018 and June 2021, 142 patients with R/R aggressive LBCL were treated with commercial anti-CD19 CAR T-cells, axi-cel (n=70) or tisa-cel (n=72). With a median follow-up of 11.4 months [IQR, 4.4-20.4], 76 patients experienced a failure based on the Cheson 2014 response assessment criteria, including 36 (47%) within the first month. Among those 36 patients who progressed during the first month, LEN was initiated before D15 in 17 pts ( EARLY LEN pts ), and 19 were not treated by LEN ( OTHER pts ). Efficacy of early LEN was assessed by CT-scan and 18FDG-PET after the 1st cycle and at the end of treatment. CAR T-cells expansion was monitored in blood by flow cytometry. All pts gave informed consent. Results . Median age of the 17 EARLY LEN pts was 65 yo (IQR 59-71) and 7 (41%) male. Histology subtypes were 12 (71%) DLBCL, including 7 GCB and 5 non-GCB, 1 (6%) PMBL, 4 (24%) tFL; 10 (59%) were treated with at least 3 prior therapies including 2 high dose therapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation. All received bridging therapy with 16 (94%) of them receiving high intensity regimen with combined immunochemotherapy. At time of infusion, 14 (82%) presented with an advanced disease (stage III or IV), 14 (82%) an elevated LDH level, 7 (41%) had at least 2 extra-nodal sites; 3 (18%) with low age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (aaIPI), 2 (12%) with low-intermediate aaIPI, 6 (35%) with high-intermediate aaIPI, and 6 (35%) with high aaIPI. Median total metabolic volume (TMTV) was 144 mL [IQR, 109-45]). The best overall response rate was observed in 15 (88%) of the EARLY LEN patients, including best complete response in 6 and best partial response in 9. Compared to the OTHER pts, the median progression-free (PFS) was significantly improved, with a median PFS of 68 days (95% CI, 52- not reached) vs 35 days (95%CI, 28-70) (p=0.035). Among the 6 pts with LEN< D15 that obtained a CR, PFS was even better with 3 events at 20, 88 and 451 days. Median overall survival (OS) was 97 days (95% CI, 76-Not reached) in the EARLY LEN pts, compared to 107 days (95 CI, 53-192) in the pts who progressed during the first month (p = 0.033). In univariate analysis, the 13 EARLY LEN pts evaluable for expansion had a higher CAR T-cell expansion in blood during the first 28 days (mean AUC D0-D28=1184 days*CART Cells number/\u00b5L of total blood) than other pts relapsing (mean=66 , p=0.0490), including those treated with LEN after D15 (mean=313, p=0.0166). Otherwise, expansion of these 13 EARLY LEN pts was similar to expansion of patients without relapse (mean=737, p=0.214). Grade 3-4 neutropenia was observed in 13 (76%) pts, grade 3-4 thrombopenia in 11 (65%) and grade 3-4 anemia in 8 (47%). Cytopenias required LEN discontinuation for 2 pts (12%). Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 13 patients (76%) (10 axi-cel and 3 tisa-cel) with a median duration of 6 days, including 1 (6%) grade 3 and no grade 4. Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome occurred in 6 (35%) (2 axi-cel and 4 tisa-cel) with a median duration of 10 days, including 1 (6%) grade 3 and no grade 4. Conclusion. Early LEN exposure at time of CAR T-cell expansion led to a high response rate in very high-risk pts of relapse after CAR T-cells. Comprehensive analyses of these mechanisms using tumor transcriptomic and single cell analyses should help for a comprehensive analysis on the peculiar mechanism of action of LEN, including not only an anti-tumoral effect, but also an immunomodulatory effect.
