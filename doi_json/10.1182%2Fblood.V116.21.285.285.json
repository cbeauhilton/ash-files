CCR4 is expressed on the surfaces of cells comprising several T-cell malignancies such as ATL, peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). A phase I study of KW-0761 in patients with CCR4-positive ATL and PTCL demonstrated that 4 weekly intravenous infusions of KW-0761 were well tolerated up to 1.0 mg/kg and it showed encouraging clinical activity with an overall response rate (ORR) of 31.3% (4 of 13 ATL and 1 of 3 PTCL) in 16 patients (J Clin Oncol 2010;28:1591-8). Methods: A multicenter phase II study of KW-0761 has been conducted for relapsed patients with CCR4-positive ATL to evaluate its efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and immunogenicity. Patients were planned to receive 8 weekly intravenous infusions of KW-0761 at 1.0 mg/kg. The primary endpoint was ORR. Objective responses were assessed after the 4th and 8th infusions of KW-0761 according to the response criteria for ATL (J Clin Oncol 2009;27:453-9) by each investigator and the independent efficacy assessment committee. The number of patients required was estimated to be 25, for 90% power to detect a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) exceeding the 5% threshold of ORR, based on the assumptions that the minimum required response ORR to a new drug for relapsed ATL is 5% and the expected ORR to KW-0761 is 30%. Results: Twenty-seven patients (12 males and 15 females) were enrolled and received KW-0761. The median age was 64 years (range: 49\u201383). The disease subtypes of ATL consisted of 14 acute-, 6 lymphoma-, and 7 chronic-types with unfavorable prognostic factors. Among the 27 patients enrolled, 14 patients (52%) completed the protocol treatment of 8 infusions. Eleven patients (41%) discontinued the protocol treatment because of progressive disease, and the remaining 2 discontinued because of skin rash or the concurrent colon tumor. The treatment-related grade (G) 2 or greater adverse events (AEs) were lymphopenia (96%), leukopenia (56%), skin rash (52%), neutropenia (33%), thrombocytopenia (26%), AST increase (26%), ALT increase (22%), hypoxemia (19%), anemia (15%), pruritus (15%), g-GTP increase (15%) and hypophosphatemia (15%). G2 or greater Infusion-related toxicities were observed in 22 of 27 patients (81%) including 1 G3, but immediately recovered after treatment with systemic steroids. Treatment-related severe AEs (SAEs) were observed in 5 patients, including a Stevens-Johnson syndrome (G3) and 4 skin rashes (each G3). All these AEs also improved by steroids. PK analysis demonstrated that C max and trough (C 168h ) after the 8th infusion was 38,853 \u00b1 11,267 and 25,934 \u00b1 10,193 ng/mL, respectively, and T1/2 after the 8th infusion were 457 \u00b1 144 h. No anti-KW-0761 antibody has been detected. Among the 26 patients evaluable for efficacy, KW-0761 exhibited an ORR of 54% (14/26; 95% CI, 33 to 73) (acute: 6/14 patients, lymphoma: 3/6 patients, chronic: 5/6 patients) including 7 complete responses (CRs) (27%; 95% CI, 12 to 48) and 7 partial responses (PRs). These are remarkable results, considering that the ORR of relapsed or refractory patients with ATL to a single-agent chemotherapy has been reported to be low (7 to 39%). Response rates according to the affected disease lesion were 100% (13 patients, all CR), 71% (5 of 7 patients), and 38% (5 of 13 patients), respectively, for peripheral blood, skin, and lymph node disease. Conclusions: KW-0761 is a highly effective agent with acceptable toxicity profiles in relapsed patients with CCR4-positive ATL who have no standard therapies. A multicenter, randomized study for untreated ATL patients to compare mLSG15 (a dose-intensified multi-agent regimen, J Clin Oncol 2007;25:5458-64) + KW-0761 with mLSG15 alone has been initiated.
