    "abstract_text": "Title) Excellent outcome of alternative donor HSCT in Fanconi anemia using chemotherapy only conditioning regimen: single Korean institution experience. Introduction) Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal (or X linked) recessive disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, secondary malignancies, and skeletal anomalies. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the standard treatment of hematologic disease. Although HSCT from a matched sibling donor (MSD) is the optimal mode of transplant, many patients lack such a donor necessitating alternative donor HSCT (AD-HSCT). Radiation treatment during the conditioning regimen results in a high incidence of post-HSCT complications in FA patients, while serotherapy with alemtuzumab has been reported to increase infectious toxicities. Here, we report on the excellent outcome of 15 FA patients who received AD-HSCT with a fludarabine-based conditioning regimen with in vivo T cell depletion using rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Methods and Results) We reviewed the medical records of FA patients diagnosed by chromosomal breakage test and who received AD-HSCT between September 2007 and December 2016. Median age at transplant was 10.8 years (4.2~18.6) and 7 were male (46.7%). Eleven of 14 patients who received genetic study for FA were found to have mutations (6 with FANC-A mutations (40%), and 5 with FANC-G mutations (33.3%)). Hematologic reasons for HSCT were severe aplastic anemia in 13 (93.3%) and myelodysplastic syndrome in 2 patients (13.3%). One patient received HSCT from a mismatched related donor, while the remaining patients received unrelated HSCT. Seven transplants were human leukocyte antigen (HLA) fully matched (13.3%). Cell sources were as follows: peripheral blood stem cells 9 (60%), cord blood 4 (26.7%), bone marrow 2 (13.3%). Conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine 30mg/BSA/day x5days (D-8,-7,-6,-5,-4), cyclophosphamide 5mg/kg/day x4days (D-5,-4,-3,-2), rabbit ATG 2.5mg/kg/day x3days (D-3,-2,-1). Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and mini-dose methotrexate. Medians of infused cell doses were as follows: TNC 16.51 x10 8 /kg (5.17~42.4), CD34 + 15.49x10 6 /kg(3.49~33.7). Twelve patients (80%) showed initial engraftment and full donor chimerism according to short tandem repeat polymerase chain reaction (STR-PCR) analysis. Of the 3 patients who showed primary graft failure, one showed autologous recovery, while the remaining 2 received additional HSCs from the same donor and a haploidentical family donor respectively, leading to engraftment. Acute GVHD grade II or above was diagnosed in 8 patients (53.5%) and resolved with steroid therapy. Chronic GVHD developed in two patients, one mild and one of moderate severity. The patient with moderate oral chronic GVHD was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue 5years after HSCT. She received surgical resection and remains disease-free for 40 months. After transplantation, 5 patients (33.3%) experienced infectious complications including viral reactivation, bacteremia and fungemia but all recovered without complications. At a median follow-up of 59.6 months (6.3~107.9) all 15 FA patients are alive and remain free of hematologic disease. Conclusion) FA patients who received AD-HSCT with fludarabine-based conditioning with in vivo T cell depletion using rabbit ATG showed excellent outcome with a lower rate of infectious toxicities than has been reported with conditioning incorporating alemtuzumab. The incidence of primary graft failure should be monitored in a larger cohort of patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
