    "abstract_text": "Background: Platelet transfusions are important for supporting patients with hematologic disorders. Refractoriness to platelet transfusions may lead to serious complications and pose a challenge to clinical management. A variety of laboratory strategies to optimize transfusion support in this population are being used; however, data on clinical correlation and success of these interventions is limited. We report the laboratory testing, transfusion yield, and clinical correlation in a cohort of patients receiving cross-matched platelet units. Methods: All consecutive adult patients refractory to platelet transfusions (failure to increment platelet count by 10 x 10(9) times two) with platelet crossmatch performed between June 2014 and April 2016 at our institution were included. Detailed clinical information, laboratory data of the crossmatch results, and Single Antigen Bead (SAB; Luminex) for each platelet unit cross-matched was retrospectively collected. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of antibodies directed towards donor platelet HLA antigens identified through SAB were grouped into zones according to previously validated laboratory data: green zone (10,000). Adequate transfusion yield was defined as an absolute increase of at least 10 x 10((9)/L platelets on a post-transfusion (i.e., within 1 hour) sample. Patients with major bleeding per International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria, palpable splenomegaly, fever during transfusion, DIC, active sepsis, or antibodies directed against human platelet antigens were excluded from the final analysis. Importantly, the Hematologist and Pathologist were blinded to the other's data until collection was completed. Data analysis correlating adequate transfusion yield and laboratory parameters was performed. Results: 22 patients (72% female) met our study criteria. All patients had a hematologic malignancy with prolonged pancytopenia after chemotherapy, 4 (18%) had undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. A total of 422 platelet cross-matches were performed, with 17 patients ultimately receiving 46 cross-matched units. The indication for transfusion was: prophylactic 35 (76%), bleeding 4 (9%) and peri-procedural 7 (15%). Ten (22%) transfusion events were excluded: splenomegaly 3, fever 4 and active severe bleeding 2. In one case a post transfusion platelet count was not performed. The overall success rate of transfusion was 64% (23/36). All transfusions leading to an adequate yield had a negative crossmatch. Of the 13 ineffective transfusions, 2 had a positive crossmatch. Based on single antigen MFI assignment, 26 (74%) donor units were classified as green zone, 8 (23%) yellow and 1 (3%) red. The success rates according to the single MFI zone assignment are presented in Table 1. These MFI-defined assignments were predictive of clinically successful transfusions. Conclusion: Selection of appropriate donor platelet units in refractory patients is a challenge that is managed in a variety of ways. While crossmatching is sometimes necessary, a strategy of antigen-avoidance can dramatically increase the identification of potentially effective platelet units for many patients. Understanding of how to navigate HLA antibody data is essential for identifying which HLA antigens should be avoided. Based on these data, in general, our practice is to avoid transfusing a platelet when there is a donor specific antibody of 8,000 MFI or greater. Furthermore, in our dataset there were two patients with both successful and unsuccessful transfusions after receiving crossmatch-negative units with green zone assignment. This finding highlights the limitations of laboratory testing and emphasizes the importance of post-transfusion platelet counts for continuously improving the platelet support of each immune-refractory patient.
