    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2509 Background: Chronic pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has an incidence of 1\u20132/100,000. Due to its low incidence, large studies in pediatric chronic ITP are difficult. This registry includes patients from 16 sites in the US and Canada and represents one of the largest longitudinal datasets of children/adolescents with chronic ITP. Objective: To describe the North American Chronic ITP Registry (NACIR) study population and evaluate univariate predictors of platelet count response to therapies, including IVIG, anti-D globulin (anti-D), steroids (5\u201314 day course), and splenectomy. Registry methods and patient characteristics: After local IRB approval, 550 patients with chronic ITP enrolled in the NACIR between January 2004 and June 2010. Eligibility included: ages 6 months-18 years at ITP diagnosis, clinical diagnosis of ITP, and ITP duration >6 months. Primary ITP was defined as isolated thrombocytopenia without associated conditions. Secondary ITP included those patients with immune thrombocytopenia associated with other immune-mediated medical conditions, including Evans Syndrome. Treatment response was defined as a post-treatment platelet count \u226550,000/uL within 7 days of IVIG, 10 days of anti-D, 14 days of steroids, and 30 days of splenectomy. 365 subjects had at least one 6 month follow-up report after enrollment; median duration of follow-up was 2.1 yrs. Demographics of participants include: 46% male; 84% Caucasian, 7% Black, and 7% Asian; and 20% Hispanic. Mean age at diagnosis of acute ITP was 8.7 \u00b1 SD 5.2 years. At the time of enrollment in NACIR, subjects had received a median of 2 prior treatments (range 0\u20137). Results: The median platelet count at diagnosis of acute ITP was 11,000/uL (IQR 6,000\u201331,000/uL) and at chronic ITP was 35,000/uL (IQR 18,000\u201366,000/uL). 69 (12.5%) patients had secondary ITP or Evans syndrome. Of those tested, 25.6% (98/359) of patients had a positive ANA (titer > 1:40), and 75/337 (22.3%) had a positive direct anti-globulin test (DAT). 27.5% of patients had an antecedent viral illness. Of the 550 subjects, 2 (0.4%) experienced life-threatening bleeding. Patients were treated as follows: 259 (47.1%) with steroids, 253 (46%) with IVIG, 189 (34.4%) with anti-D, and 64 (11.6%) with splenectomy. Overall responses to therapy included: 69.1% response to steroids, 74.3% response to IVIG, 66.7% response to anti-D, and 85.9% response to splenectomy. Univariate predictors of response to treatments are shown in Table I . Higher platelet count at chronic ITP diagnosis and DAT positive predicted a platelet response to a short course of steroids in univariate analysis. This was confirmed in multivariable analysis of potential confounders, using logistic regression with a backwards elimination procedure. Response to one type of therapy was often strongly associated with a response to a second therapy. Gender, ethnicity, race, older age, and platelets \u226520,000/uL at acute ITP diagnosis were not associated with response to any single therapy. Conclusion: The demographics and laboratory findings of the large, well characterized NACIR population are consistent with other reports of young people with chronic ITP. The novel finding that DAT positivity predicts steroid response, even with multivariable adjustment for confounders, provides evidence that the NACIR is a robust and useful tool for trying to predict response to ITP treatment strategies.
