    "abstract_text": "Background Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients present disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) that can result in life-threatening hemorrhagic complications. In 2008, the anticoagulant thrombomodulin alfa (TM-\u03b1, recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin) was approved for the treatment of DIC in Japan. After commercial launch, only small case series have been described in APL patients, and data from larger patients cohort are awaited. We accessed the clinical safety and beneficial effects of TM-\u03b1 treatment in DIC patients with APL, by evaluating data on the open-label, multicenter, post-marketing surveillance study cohort. Patients and Methods A retrospective evaluation was carried out on a cohort of 172 patients with APL from the open-label, multicenter, post-marketing surveillance study of TM-\u03b1 in Japan. Of all 172 patients, 31 were relapse/refractory APL patients and 141 were newly diagnosed. The newly diagnosed APL patients were generally received all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracycline-containing induction therapy followed by consolidation therapy as previously reported by the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (Yanada et al, Eur. J. Haematol. 2007). The relapse/refractory APL patients were received arsenic trioxide, tamibarotene, and/or gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Early death (death within 30 days from the start of antileukemic treatment), severe hemorrhagic events, and the improvement of coagulopathy were analyzed. Results The study population consisted of 97 males and 75 females, with a median age of 58 (range 10 - 88). TM-\u03b1 was administration by 380 \u00b1 52.5 U/kg/day and the duration of dosing was 7.0 \u00b1 6.3 days. In most patients (81 %), TM-\u03b1 was started on or before the start of antileukemic treatment. Within the first 30 days, 12 patients (7 %) had severe hemorrhage and there were 24 (14 %) early deaths. Six of those (3.5% of 172 patients) were due to hemorrhage. TM-\u03b1 treatment rapidly and significantly improved coagulopathy regardless of concomitant ATRA treatment ( Table 1 ).

The amount of change was defined as the value at the end of TM-\u03b1 administration minus the value at baseline divided by the value at baseline.
