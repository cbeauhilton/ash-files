    "abstract_text": "Dec 2018, 7 consecutive patients, ( CLL n = 1; FL n = 3; DLBCL n= 1 AEA n=1,ITP n=1), were enrolled in the study. Median age of the patients was 68 years (range, 28-87). The pharmacoeconomic analysis included assessment of direct costs ( hospital inpatient, physician inpatient, physician outpatient, emergency department nursing home care, specialists' and other health professionals' care, diagnostic tests, prescription drugs and drug sundries, and medical supplies),indirect costs incurred by care recipients and unpaid caregivers, including time, productivity and travel cost. Results Rituximab subcutaneous formulation was administered at a fixed dose of 1400 mg with a frequency related to the type and the phase of the treated disease. Before starting MabThera subcutaneous injections, all patients received beforehand, a full dose of Rituximab by intravenous infusion. Premedication with an anti-pyretic an antihistaminic and prednisone , was given orally in the evening before and the morning of the subcutaneous administration the infusion was carried out by the staff of the home care unit together with a doctor. All the procedure was controlled by the hospital specialist through a smart-phone. Median age of the patients was 58 years (range, 32-83). Median number of courses delivered to each patient was 6 (range, 4- 12) .Adherence to treatment was 100%.No Infusion related adverse reactions have been observed. Conclusion In our experience, despite the high percentage of elderly patients of whom 36% living in rural area, it was possible to give treatment to all patients with high adherence and satisfaction. There has been a reduction in direct medical costs due to less use of hospitalization, a reduction of indirect costs by 70% due to the lower number of working days lost and a drastic reduction of travel costs, with the same safety of administration.
