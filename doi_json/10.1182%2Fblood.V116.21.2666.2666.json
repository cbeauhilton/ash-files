    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2666 Acute erythroid stress causes elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in primates. However, relationships between the chronic erythroid stress in children with Sickle Cell Disease (HbSS) and HbF production are less well understood. For this study, peripheral blood from children with HbSS was analyzed within 72 hours of collection and storage at 4\u00b0C. The level of erythroid stress was determined by absolute reticulocyte counts (ARC) as well as reticulocyte flow cytometry phenotyping and sorting using CD71 (HiCD71, LoCD71 and NegCD71) and CD36. Immature reticulocytes were identified by HiCD71 expression and included the CD36+ population. Sorted populations from at least three subjects were utilized to assess fetal globin expression during reticulocyte maturation according to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). While the number of gamma-globin mRNA copies/cell decreased with reticulocyte maturation, the ratio of gamma/gamma+beta mRNA remained stable. HbF protein levels in the HiCD71 and LoCD71 populations were equivalent for each patient with average values of 4.3\u00b14.2% HiCD71 vs. 4.4\u00b14.0% LoCD71, p=0.96. By comparison, HbF levels in the NegCD71 were increased in all subjects (14.2\u00b19.5% NegCD71, p300 mean event rate=0.59\u00b10.60 events/year, p=0.0028). These data suggest that increased levels of erythroid stress as measured by reticulocyte production and maturation in pediatric HbSS subjects is not associated with elevated gamma-globin mRNA or HbF levels. Instead, higher levels of reticulocytosis were associated with lower HbF levels and increased disease severity. Disclosures: Noel: NIH: Patents & Royalties.",
