    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3137 Notch signaling inhibits B-ALL growth and survival, while it promotes T-ALL, revealing contrasting cell-specific consequences of Notch signaling in ALL subtypes. We previously reported that HES1 (Hairy and Enhancer of split1) is a Notch pathway member which is sufficient to reproduce these effects in B-ALL. We have found distinct HES1 protein complexes in B-ALL versus T-ALL, with significantly higher molecular weight complexes found in B-ALL. Through characterization of these complexes, multiple novel HES1 interacting proteins have been identified which regulate HES1 function as well as provide growth inhibiting and pro-apoptotic effects. We previously reported the novel role of HES1:PARP1 complexes in inducing B-ALL apoptosis. This study reports Polo-like kinase1 (PLK1) and Kinesin Family member 11 (KIF11, also known as Eg5) as novel HES1 interacting proteins in B-ALL. PLK1 is highly expressed in B cell leukemias and drives multiple proliferative pathways including activation of KIF11, induction of cyclinB and degradation of p53. KIF11 is also highly expressed in B-ALL and promotes cell cycle progression through enhanced spindle formation, while cyclinB promotes accelerated mitosis. Through HES1 immunoprecipitation and MALDI-TOF peptide analysis, we identified KIF11 as a potential HES1 interacting protein. Low flow size exclusion chromatography revealed that HES1 and KIF11 co-migrate in high molecular weight complexes. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) with HES1 and KIF11 antibodies reveal a strong protein-protein interaction in B-ALL cells. PLK1 was also identified in these complexes, revealing a novel interaction of HES1, KIF11 and PLK1. Importantly, induction of Notch signaling via HES1 in B-ALL decreases both PLK1 and KIF11 levels, associated with G1 cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, HES1 expression decreased cyclinB protein levels, but not cyclin A/E, consistent with inhibition of PLK1. Finally, in the same model we observe increased p53 and p21 WAF1 protein levels, also contributing to growth arrest. These data reveal that multiple mechanisms of Notch/HES1-mediated growth arrest may occur via PLK1 in B-ALL. The novel interaction of HES1 with PLK1 and KIF11 and resulting effects on KIF11, cyclinB and p53/p21 pathways may represent important mechanisms of Notch-mediated growth inhibition in B-ALL.
