    "abstract_text": "The number of CD34+ cells infused affects the outcome of allogeneic HSCT significantly. Low cell doses result in higher treatment-related mortality (TRM) and lower overall survival (OS) (<2 x 10 6 /kg. Singhal et al. Bone Marrow Transplant  2000 ; 26 : 489 \u201396 ). Very high doses result in significantly increased GVHD but no directly obvious detrimental effect on OS (>8 x 10 6 /kg. Przepiorka et al. Blood  2001 ; 98 : 1695 \u20131700 . Zaucha et al. Blood  2001 ; 98 : 3221 \u20137 ). No data are available on the effect of CD34+ cell doses in the intevening range. Based upon the limited published data, we have tried to aim for an allograft CD34+ cell dose of between 2 and 8 x 10 6 /kg ideal body weight (IBW). We analyzed the outcome of 58 allogeneic HSCT recipients (31\u201366 y, median 52; 25 lymphoma/CLL, 18 acute leukemia, 15 myeloma) who received an \"acceptable\" CD34+ cell dose (2\u22128 x 10 6 /kg) from HLA-matched siblings (n=37), 10/10 allele-matched unrelated donors (n=15), or 1-locus/allele mismatched sibling/unrelated donors (n=6). Patients receiving lower (8) CD34+ cell doses were excluded. The conditioning regimen was 100 mg/m 2 melphalan with (n=40; no prior autograft) or without (n=18; prior autograft) 50 mg/kg cyclophosphamide. GVHD prophylaxis comprised cyclosporine-mycophenolate for HLA-identical sibling donor grafts and tacrolimus-mycophenolate for the rest. No growth factors were administered, and all supportive care was uniform. The actual CD34+ cell dose was 2.1\u20137.7 (median 5.0) x 10 6 /kg IBW. A threshold of 6 x 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg was chosen for detailed analysis as it provided a significant cutpoint for OS comparison using the logrank statistic (P=0.039). Other cutpoints (\u22645 vs >5 and \u22645.5 vs >5.5) showed superiority for higher cell doses but did not reach statistical significance. The cell dose was >6 x 10 6 /kg in 11 and \u22646 x 10 6 /kg in 47. 13 patients experienced TRM; all in the \u22646 group (P=0.045; Fisher\u2019s exact test). The following factors were analyzed in a Cox model for their effect on OS: chemosensitive (n=24) vs refractory disease (n=34), age \u226455 (n=40) vs >55 (n=18), normal (n=29) vs abnormal (n=29) LDH, HLA match (n=52) vs mismatch (n=6), prior autograft or not, performance status 0\u20131 (n=45) vs 2\u20133 (n=13).

Our data suggest that even within the broad range considered acceptable based on current literature, higher CD34+ cell doses appear to improve OS by reducing TRM. Further work in larger patient groups is required to define the optimum CD34+ cell dose to be used for allogeneic HSCT so that this clinically modifiable parameter can be eliminated as a variable potentially affecting outcome adversely. Until additional data are available, we suggest infusing a CD34+ cell dose that is >6 but <8 x 10 6 per kg IBW for allogeneic HSCT.",
