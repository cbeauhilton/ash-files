    "abstract_text": "Effector CD8 + T cells play a crucial role in anti-tumor immunity. Two major subsets of effector CD8 + T cells have been identified based on expression of KLRG1 and CD127: KLRG1 + CD127 - short-lived effector cells (SLECs) and KLRG1 - CD127 + memory precursor effector cells (MPECs). In B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the frequency and function of SLECs and MPECs are unknown. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism by which these two CD8 + subsets were regulated and differentiate in B-cell NHL remains poorly understood. The goal of the present study is therefore to phenotypically and functionally characterize SLECs and MPECs in B-cell NHL. Using patient biopsy specimens, we observed that the median percentage of SLECs was greater than MPECs and was 39.9% (range: 22.7%~ 54.7%) and 18% (range: 7.66%~31.6%), respectively. In controls, the median percentage of SLECs was lower than that of MPECs and was 13.71% (range: 5.26%~29.2%) and 51.63% (range: 22.5%~70.1%) in PBMC and 12.14% (range: 4.01%~26%) and 51.62% (range: 29.2%~70.3%) in tonsil, respectively. Using mass cytometry (CyTOF), we observed that SLECs have higher expression levels of TIGIT and PD-1 and lower expression of CCR7, CD26 and CD27 when compared to MPECs. SLECs were functionally superior to MPECs as the numbers of cytokine (IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1) - and granule (granzyme B and perforin)-producing cells were higher in SLECs than MPECs. However, SLECs had a lower proliferative capacity and a higher apoptosis rate when compared to MPECs. We observed that a reciprocal differentiation pathway exists between SLECs and MPECs. Activation and cytokine stimulation (IL-2 and IL-15) promoted the development of SLECs and decreased the number of MPECs. This effect was reversed when cells were treated with neutralizing antibodies to block IL-2 or IL-15 signaling. We also found that these two subsets had a distinct transcription factor profile as SLECs had higher expression of Eomes and T-bet, and lower expression of Tcf-1than MPECs. IL-2 and IL-15 enhanced the expression of T-bet and decreased the expression of Tcf-1. Taken together, our results show that SLECs are more prevalent than MPECs in B-cell NHL when compared to normal control tissue. These two effector cell subsets have distinct phenotypical and function profiles and their development is controlled by cytokines that may be dysregulated in lymphoma. Despite the fact that SLECs produce more granzyme B and IFN-\u03b3, they are less proliferative and more susceptible to apoptosis. This may compromise an effective anti-tumor immune response in B-cell NHL.
