    "abstract_text": "Abstract 644 The efficient accumulation of hemoglobin in mature erythrocytes is critically dependent upon the high stabilities of mRNAs encoding human \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin proteins. These mRNAs are likely to be stabilized by interactions between one or more trans -acting regulatory factors that target defined cis -acting elements within their 3\u2032UTRs. Several ubiquitous factors that are known to bind to the \u03b2-globin 3\u2032UTR (including \u03b1CP, PTBP1, and nucleolin) are largely restricted to the nucleus and therefore unlikely to contribute to regulatory processes affecting \u03b2-globin mRNA in the cytoplasm. Consequently, we conducted a series of experiments that identify and characterize mRNA-binding factors that dictate the properties of \u03b2-globin mRNA in the cytoplasm of erythroid progenitor cells. Using electrophoretic gel mobility shift analyses (EMSA), we defined a characteristic mRNP complex that assembles on the \u03b2-globin 3\u2032UTR in cytoplasmic extract\u2013but not nuclear extract\u2013prepared from erythroid K562 cells. This mRNP \u2018\u03b2-complex\u2019 appears to be erythroid-specific, as it fails to assemble in extracts prepared from non-erythroid HeLa or HEK cells. The 3\u2032UTR binding site for the \u03b2-complex was identified using an EMSA-competition approach; remarkably, the target sequence is encompassed within a 12-nt region previously identified as a functional determinant of \u03b2-globin mRNA stability in in vivo analyses. Additional experiments fine-mapped the \u03b2-complex binding site to a GGGGG pentanucleotide motif within the mRNA-stabilizing region. The functional importance of the pentanucleotide was illustrated by mRNA decay experiments in intact erythroid K562 cells showing that full-length \u03b2-globin mRNAs are destabilized by introduction of the same GG GGG-> CC GGG mutation that ablates \u03b2-complex assembly in EMSA analyses. To identify trans -factors that comprise the \u03b2-complex, we performed affinity chromatography using ssDNA probes corresponding to the \u03b2-complex binding motif. The native 3\u2032UTR probe retained 42- and 47-kDa proteins, while a probe carrying the CC GGG mutation failed to bind either factor. Subsequent LC/MS/MS analyses identified the two proteins as YB-1 and AUF-1. The identities of these two mRNA-binding factors, which have previously been implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of heterologous mRNAs, were subsequently confirmed by immunoblot of the protein-DNA complexes. Subsequent analyses suggested a functional role for both factors: EMSA supershift experiments confirmed that YB-1 is a component of the \u03b2-complex, and RNA immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that both YB-1 and AUF-1 specifically bind to \u03b2-globin mRNA in vivo in intact erythroid K562 cells. Collectively, these data identify two novel trans -acting factors that bind to cytoplasmic \u03b2-globin mRNA in an erythroid-specific fashion, at a site that dictates its stability in intact cells. We are currently engaged in siRNA knock-down experiments to validate experiments that suggest the importance of these trans -acting factors to the constitutive cytoplasmic stability of \u03b2-globin mRNA, as well as structural analyses intended to define RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions that are critical to normal functioning of the \u03b2-complex. The results of these experiments have obvious implications for the design of novel therapies for patients with congenital disorders of \u03b2-globin gene expression, including sickle cell disease and \u03b2 thalassemia.
