    "abstract_text": "Introduction The CD200/CD200 receptor (CD200R) axis is known to exert immunoregulatory effects in myeloid-derived cells and constitutes a putative immune checkpoint in hematological malignancies, in which CD200 expression is associated with poor prognosis. In multiple myeloma (MM), CD200 is expressed in the majority of patient-derived primary cells. However, its functional importance as well as the related downstream mechanism upon CD200 ligand binding to its CD200R on T cells are not well understood. In this study, we analyze the functional role of CD200 as a potential immune checkpoint in MM and decipher the mechanism of CD200-mediated immune escape. Methods Primary MM cells and MM cell lines were analyzed for CD200 surface expression by flow cytometry. To overexpress CD200 on non-expressing MM cell lines we used a Sleeping Beauty transposon vector system. CD200+/- MM cell lines L363, U266 and MM.1s were co-cultured with CD3/CD28-activated healthy donor T cells. T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in these co-cultures was assessed with flow cytometry and/or luciferase assay. Moreover, to analyze the effects of CD200R activation on downstream signaling pathways, activated T cells were treated with recombinant human CD200 (rhCD200) and/or anti-CD200 blocking antibody and subsequently, Western blotting was performed. Results Of n=120 primary MM samples (n=120) analyzed, CD200 protein expression could be detected in ca. 75 % of the cases. In contrast, all n=9 MM cell lines tested neither displayed surface nor cytoplasmic CD200 expression. Therefore, using a Sleeping Beauty transposon vector system we stably expressed CD200 on MM cell lines for further analyses. In the presence of CD200-expressing MM cells up to 50% decrease in CD3+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against MM cells was observed in flow cytometry and luciferase assay. Proliferation rates of MM cell lines remained unchanged regardless of the level of CD200 overexpression as determined by Alamar blue assays. In myeloid-derived cells, CD200R directly interacts with docking protein-2 (DOK2). In activated T cells, we observed DOK2 phosphorylation upon CD200 binding when treated with rhCD200 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Applying an anti-CD200 blocking antibody, this effect could be reversed, thus revealing a possible mechanism for the observed attenuation of T cell function. Conclusion Our study shows that anti-MM cytotoxicity from primary healthy donor CD3+ T cells is attenuated by CD200 expression on MM cells. We also demonstrate that this inhibitory mechanism in CD3+ T cells is mediated via DOK2, providing a potential target for immunotherapeutic approaches in MM.
