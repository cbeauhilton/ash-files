    "abstract_text": "Background : Momelotinib is a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor that is currently being evaluated in phase-3 clinical trials for the treatment of myelofibrosis (MF) (NCT01969838, NCT02101268). In a phase-1/2 clinical trial of patients with MF, the drug was shown to improve anemia, reduce spleen size and alleviate symptoms ( Leukemia 2013;27:1322 ). In the current study, we considered 100 consecutive patients from the Mayo Clinic who received momelotinib therapy, in order to identify molecular and cytogenetic predictors of treatment response and survival from the time of study entry. Methods : The study patients constituted part of a phase-1/2 clinical trial (NCT00935987) using momelotinib in MF. Details of the protocol, including inclusion and exclusion criteria were previously published ( Leukemia 2013;27:1322 ). Response was determined by the 2006 response criteria published by the IWG-MRT. Data analysis and interpretation was carried out independent of any influence from the sponsor. Results : 100 patients with MF (median age 66 years; 58% males) were treated at the Mayo Clinic between 11/20/09 and 11/10/10. MF type was primary in 64% of the patients and post-polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia in 36%. DIPSS-plus risk distribution was 63% high, 36% intermediate-2 and 1% intermediate-1. Red cell transfusion dependency was documented in 49% and palpable spleen size of >5 cm (median 19 cm) in 92%. All patients were annotated for JAK2 / CALR / MPL mutations with respective frequencies of 73%, 16% and 7%. Frequencies for other mutations included 42% for ASXL1 (84 evaluable) and 18% for SRSF2 (78 evaluable). All patients were evaluable for karyotype, which was unfavorable in 17%. Previous treatment included other JAK inhibitors in 21 patients, thalidomide/lenalidomide/pomalidomide in 31 and hydroxyurea or other cytoreductive agents in 55. Momelotinib was initiated at 100 mg/day in 3 patients, 150 mg/day in 21, 150 mg twice-daily in 20, 200 mg/day in 3, 300 mg/day in 47 and 400 mg/day in 6. The maximum momelotinib dose was 150 mg/day in 6 patients, 150 mg twice-daily in 20, 300 mg/day in 68 and 400 mg/day in 6. Treatment duration was 24 months in 47. Genetic correlates of response to momelotinib : Overall response rate was 57% and included no complete remissions (0%), one (1%) partial remission and 57 (57%) clinical improvements (CI). Response rates for spleen/liver and anemia were 43% (91 evaluable) and 44% (68 evaluable), respectively. Transfusion independency was achieved in 25 (51%) of 49 evaluable cases. Spleen/liver response rate was significantly affected by JAK2 / CALR / MPL mutational status (34% vs 73% vs 60%, respectively, and 50% in triple-negative; p=0.04), CALR mutated vs unmutated status (73% vs 37%; p=0.009), and unmutated vs mutated ASXL1 (53% vs 29%; p=0.035). Furthermore, all 8 (100%) patients who were CALR +/ ASXL1 - responded vs 6 (25%) of 24 CALR -/ ASXL1 + vs 3 (50%) of 6 CALR +/ ASXL1+ vs 16 (43%) of 37 CALR -/ ASXL1 - patients (p=0.003). Spleen/liver response rates were not affected by SRSF2 mutations (p=0.93) or karyotype (p=0.41). Anemia response rate was not affected by JAK2 / CALR / MPL (p=0.81), ASXL1 (p=0.16), SRSF2 (p=0.12) or CALR / ASXL1 (p=0.42) mutational status or karyotype (p=0.65). The number of informative cases for EZH2 , IDH , SF3B1 and U2AF1 mutations were not adequate enough to warrant similar analysis. Genetic correlates of survival from time of protocol entry : Median follow-up after the institution of protocol drug therapy was 35 months (range 1-49). During this period, 57 (57%) deaths and 12 (12%) leukemic transformations were documented. On multivariable analysis, shortened survival was predicted by the presence of ASXL1 (p=0.01; HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.8) or SRSF2 (0.01; HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.8) mutations and the absence of CALR mutations (p=0.03; HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1-8.9). Karyotype was significant on univariate (p=0.01) but not in multivariable (p=0.6) analysis that included the aforementioned mutations. The prognostic relevance of each specific mutation was DIPSS-plus independent. Conclusions : We demonstrate significant associations between CALR and ASXL1 mutational status and spleen response to momelotinib therapy in MF. We also show that momelotinib therapy did not overcome the inferior survival associated with the presence of ASXL1 or SRSF2 mutations or the absence of CALR mutations.
