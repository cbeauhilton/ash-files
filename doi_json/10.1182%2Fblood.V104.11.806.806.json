    "abstract_text": "Objectives: This study examines the role of pericardial wound monocytes in thrombin generation during clinical cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Background: The mechanism by which wound mononuclear cells rapidly express procoagulant activity is unexplained. Methods: Factor VII activation (FVIIa) was measured using recombinant, truncated, soluble tissue factor (rsTF) and various blood cells in vitro . FVIIa was also measured with monocytes and soluble plasma tissue factor taken before CPB and simultaneously from the pericardial wound and perfusion circuit during CPB in thirteen patients. Results: RsTF in combination with monocytes, but not platelets, neutrophils or red cells, accelerates activation of FVII beginning at 1 pmole/L rsTF. Less than 1% rsTF is bound, yet catalytic activity peaks at 7 minutes and decays afterwards. In wound plasma, monocytes are activated (MCP-1 = 29.5 \u00b1 2.1 pmoles/L) and wound plasma tissue factor (wpTF) is substantially elevated (3.64 \u00b1 0.45 pmoles/L) with 81.7% in the supernatant and 18.3% in microparticles. By Western blot all forms of plasma TF migrate at Mr 65 kDa [TF/FVII(FVIIa) complex]. Wound monocytes and C5a activated prebypass or perfusate monocytes plus wpTF convert all available FVII to FVIIa. Activated monocytes plus supernatant TF/FVII(VIIa) more efficiently activate factor X than microparticle TF/FVII(FVIIa). The correlation coefficient (r) between wound thrombin generation (F1.2) and wpTF is 0.944 (p = 0.0004). Conclusions: During clinical cardiac surgery with CPB wound monocytes plus wpTF or microparticle-free, protein fragments of wound tissue factor preferentially accelerate activation of FVII and FX. This system represents a new mechanism of thrombin generation."
