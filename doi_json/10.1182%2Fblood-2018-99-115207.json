    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT Background: In 2014, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) established a practice improvement module (PIM) incorporating quality metrics for management of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Such PIMs have allowed physicians to monitor the quality of care in their practice. We implemented a DLBCL quality improvement initiative (QII) at our institution in January, 2015. In an appraisal of this initiative, we reviewed the ASH PIM metrics and included several others to assess adherence to guidelines for treatment of DLBCL and to examine the need for institutional improvement. Methods: Patients who were newly diagnosed with DLBCL and received treatment at our institution from January 2006 through December 2017 were identified. Electronic medical records were reviewed for documentation of ASH PIM quality measures (e.g., key pathologic features of DLBCL, lymphoma staging, screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients receiving rituximab-based chemotherapy, etc). We also reviewed the proportion of patients who had assessment of prognosis by revised International Prognostic Index (r-IPI) score, testing for hepatitis C (HCV), HIV viral infections, chemotherapy education, and the addition of rituximab in the treatment regimen of CD20+ DLBCL. Results: Following implementation of the QII, our institution saw improvement in most quality metrics. Particularly significant were improvements in reporting of key molecular features (45.45% to 91.6%, P < 0.0001), screening for HBV (41.82% to 91.67%, P < 0.001) and HIV infections (33.94% to 87.5%, P < 0.0001). All patients post-QII had a PET-CT scan for staging of DLBCL and there was a significantly lower use of bone marrow biopsy (61.2% to 33.33%, P = 0.011). Conclusion: Implementation of a quality initiative and employing standardized metrics can aid in improving institutional quality of care for patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL, and allows opportunity to build and ensure better adherence to evolving national and professional patient care guidelines.
