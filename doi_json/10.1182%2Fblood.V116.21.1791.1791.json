    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1791 Background Advanced stage T-cell or NK/T-cell lymphomas usually show aggressive clinical course and their treatment outcomes are worse than B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Furthermore, the optimal treatment regimen is not still established for these disease entities. At present, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) regimen is still used as a primary treatment for advanced stage T or NK/T cell lymphomas although its efficacy is not satisfactory. Thus, more effective treatment regimen is required to improve treatment outcome. The incorporation of new targeted agents into CHOP regimen has been a widely used strategy to develop new regimen for the treatment of lymphoma. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor approved for the use of treatment of multiple myeloma has been tried in many B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. A recent in vitro study results showed that proteasome inhibitor could inhibit the growth of NK/T lymphoma cells. Based on these results, we designed a regimen combining CHOP with. Our previous phase I study determined the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib as 1.6mg/m 2 for combination with CHOP. Thus, we performed the phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of bortezomib plus CHOP chemotherapy. Methods We enrolled patients with newly diagnosed T or NK/T cell lymphoma. All patients were Ann Arbor stage III/IV and had adequate organ function. Patients received bortezomib on days 1 and 8 (weekly schedule, 1.6 mg/m 2 per dose) in addition to 750 mg/m 2 cyclophosphamide, 50 mg/m 2 doxorubicin, 1.4 mg/m 2 vincristine on day 1 and 100 mg/day prednisolone on days 1 to 5, every 3 weeks. Six cycles of therapy administered every 21 days were planned. All patients provided written informed consents and this trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT00374699 ). Results 46 patients were enrolled between April 2007 and August 2009. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified (n=16) and extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (n=10) were dominant subtypes while angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (n=8) and ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n=6) account for 30.4% of all patients. Five patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and one hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma were also recruited. The median age at diagnosis was 52 years (range 21 \u2013 66 years). Serum LDH elevation (n = 28, 60.9%) and stage IV patients were dominant (n = 32, 69.6%). Thus, the International Prognostic Index risk was dominantly high or high-intermediate (n = 26, 56.5%). Complete response was achieved in 30 patients (65.2%) and partial response was 5 patients (10.9%). As a result, the overall response rate was 76.1%. The comparison of complete response rate based on the subtype demonstrated that the complete response rate of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified (12/19, 63.2%), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (6/8, 75%), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (4/6, 66.7%) and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (5/5, 100.0%) was better than extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (3/10, 30.0%). Five patients with extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma progressed during the treatment with bortezomib and CHOP. The hematologic toxicity was the major toxicity of this regimen, thus, grade 3/4 leucopenia and febrile neutropenia were the most frequent toxicity. However, there was no treatment-related mortality. In addition, neurotoxicity was tolerable, so the majority of peripheral neurotoxicity was grade 1 or 2. Conclusion The combined treatment of bortezomib with CHOP is an effective regimen for advanced stage T-cell lymphomas with acceptable toxicity. However, it may not be efficient for advanced stage extranodal NK/T-cell lymphomas. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
