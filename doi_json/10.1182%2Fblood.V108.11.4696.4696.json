    "abstract_text": "Patients with lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin disease (LPHD) often present at an early stage with slow disease progression. Although 96% of LPHD patients experience a complete remission (CR) upon first line treatment, many relapses occur. CD20+ is strongly expressed by malignant cells in LPHD, but so far there is limited information regarding the efficacy of rituximab in this patient population. We report 46-year-old woman who presented in 2004 with left cervical lymphadenopathy and weight loss. Case report: Biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of LPHD(stage IIB disease), immunohistochemistry revealed that >30% of malignant cells were CD20+, and a bulky mediastinal mass was observed by computer tomography (CT). Blood counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin and lactate dehydrogenate were normal. The patient was treated with rituximab and ABVD (doxorubicin 25mg/m 2 , bleomycin 10mg/m 2 , vinbalstine 6mg/m 2 , dacarbazine 375mg/m 2 , six cycles). Rituximab was administered (375mg/m 2 ) one day before chemotherapy (50mg/h for one hour and gradually escalated to a maximum of 400mg/h). Treatment was well tolerated and there were no complications. The patient was assessed immediately following treatment and every three months for the following year, by physical examination, CT, bone marrow biopsy and routine analyses. A detectable tumor mass was no observed by CT for the follow up of 2 years, the patient remains in complete remission. Conclusion: Our case report suggests that Rituximab is both safe and effective in patients with CD20+ LPHD. Further studies with Rituximab are warranted in this patient population.",
