    "abstract_text": "Thrombosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and thrombin is a major inducer of thrombus formation. Thus several antithrombotic agents targeting thrombin have been developed. We previously reported an anticoagulant and antiplatelet thrombin derivative, \u2018M-anhydrothrombin\u2019 prepared by chemical modifications. In this study, we prepared a new thrombin mutant, specificity of which was highly modulated with substantially improved antithrombotic efficacy. The thrombin mutant designated \u201cAAA-Thrombin\u201d in which Lys65, His43 and Ser205 in B-chain have been replaced by Ala revealed higher affinity and specificity for factor VIII with no enzymatic activity. AAA-Thrombin prolonged APTT much more than anhydrothrombin in a dose dependent manner without affecting PT and TT. Platelet aggregation induced by activation of PAR-1 was also effectively suppressed by AAA-Thrombin. \u201cM-AAA-Thrombin\u201d prepared by further chemical modification of carboxyl groups in AAA-Thrombin enhanced its antithrombotic efficacy. M-AAA-Thrombin (250nM) prolonged APTT approx. two times, and suppressed platelet aggregation by PAR-1 activation, while AAA-Thrombin did not at the same concentration. M-AAA-Thrombin also suppressed ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation. In vivo experiments, M-AAA-Thrombin demonstrated significant antithrombotic property in the arterio-venous shunt thrombosis model and the FeCl 3 -induced carotid artery thrombosis model in guinea pigs. These results indicate that M-AAA-Thrombin would be a candidate for quite an innovative anticoagulant and antiplatelet agent for both arterial and venous thromboses. Further optimization of mutagenesis and modification, in terms of efficacy and safety is in progress in our laboratory.",
