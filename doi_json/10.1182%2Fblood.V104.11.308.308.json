    "abstract_text": "From 5/89 to 5/01, 256 patients (pts) with classical Hodgkin\u2019s disease were treated on prospective trials with the weekly Stanford V (doxorubicin, vinblastine, mustard, vincristine, bleomycin, etoposide, prednisone) regimen +/\u2212 radiotherapy (RT). Pts with non-bulky stage I-IIA disease received 8 weeks Stanford V + 30 Gy involved field RT (G4 protocol, n=87) at Stanford (n=52) or Northern California Kaiser Permanente (n=35). Pts with bulky stage II (mediastinal mass > 1/3 intrathoracic diameter) or III,IV disease received 12 weeks Stanford V + 36 Gy to sites >=5 cm or macroscopic splenic disease (G2,3 protocol, n =169) at Stanford University. Bulky mediastinal pts received mediastinal, hilar and bilateral supraclavicular RT but no axillary or high neck RT to sites =4} with advanced stage disease, 16 (67%) were successfully treated with second-line therapy. Eleven pts have died: 6 from Hodgkin\u2019s disease and 1 each from suicide, complications of second-line transplantation, influenza, lung cancer, and unknown cause. No cases of secondary myelodysplasia/leukemia or non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma have occurred. Second cancers included 1 prostate (no pelvic RT), 1 colon ( no abdominal RT but TBI used with second-line transplant), 1 lung (no RT) and 2 breast (1 with DCIS after mediastinal RT, 1 after axillary RT for >10 cm mass). To date, 72 post-treament conceptions (excluding pre-treament semen or embryo cryopreservation) were recorded with 65 live births (+ 4 current pregnancies) among 34 men and 30 women. In our hands, the Stanford V + RT regimen was effective with modest toxicity and 25% pts conceived post-treatment. An international score >=4 was the major adverse prognostic factor; the majority of relapses were successfully treated secondarily. These data support definitive testing of this treatment program as in the ongoing E2496 Intergroup Study for bulky and advanced stage disease. Efficacy and Late Effects  . All patients .
