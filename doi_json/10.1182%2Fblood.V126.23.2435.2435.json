    "abstract_text": "Chromosomal translocations generate a variety of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion genes, which cause aggressive leukemia. Although >70 different fusion partners have been identified, the majority of the cases are caused by the chimeric genes of MLL and a component of the AEP co-activator complex (hereafter referred to as AEP), which comprises of AF4 family proteins (e.g. AF4, AF5Q31), ENL family proteins (e.g. ENL, AF9), and the P-TEFb elongation factor. MLL-AEP fusion proteins constitutively activate their target genes by recruiting AEP components to their target chromatin, whereas wild-type MLL recruits AEP in a context-dependent manner. In the hematopoietic lineage, MLL fusion proteins aberrantly activate a subset of genes implicated in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) program, such as HOXA9 and MEIS1 . Constitutive expression of these HSC program genes in hematopoietic progenitors has been shown to induce leukemia in a mouse model. It has been speculated that MLL-AEP activates transcription of those HSC program genes by aberrantly activating transcription elongation. However, it is largely unclear how AEP activates transcription. Using an extensive structure/function analysis, we revealed that a serine-rich domain of the AF4 family proteins, termed pSER, is an essential functional component of MLL-AEP-dependent gene activation and leukemic transformation. Through biochemical purification, we have identified Selectivity Factor 1 (SL1) as a novel factor associated with the pSER domain. SL1 comprises TBP and four TBP-associated factors (TAF1A, TAF1B, TAF1C, TAF1D), and is known as a core component of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) of RNA polymerase I (RNAP1). In the presence of UBF, SL1 forms a PIC on the promoters of ribosomal RNA genes, to drive RNAP1-dependent transcription. However, its role in RNAP2-dependent transcription was unknown. The initiation of RNAP2-dependent transcription in eukaryotes occurs through the loading of TBP to the promoter, via a direct association with the TATA element or through as-yet-unidentified mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that AEP facilitates the initiation of RNAP2-dependent transcription via the loading of TBP onto the TATA element, through SL1 activity. MLL-AEP fusion proteins utilize this TBP-loading function to activate transcription initiation in leukemic transformation. The wild-type AEP complex activates gene expression in the same manner in the physiological conditions. Taken together, our results unveil a novel role of SL1 as a TBP-loading factor in RNAP2-dependent gene activation, and a previously unknown transcription initiation mechanism involving AEP, which is more important than its transcription elongation activities for leukemic transformation. These findings greatly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of MLL fusion-dependent leukemic transformation, which was previously interpreted simply as mis-regulated transcription elongation.
