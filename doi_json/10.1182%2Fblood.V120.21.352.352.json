    "abstract_text": "Abstract 352 Background: Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for MM leads to complete responses in \u223c20\u201340% of patients but rare cures. Patients with rapid recovery of T cells post ASCT may have improved outcomes suggesting possible immune mediated tumor control. We have shown that adoptive T-cell transfers after ASCT for MM using vaccine-primed and ex-vivo costimulated autologous T-cells in combination with pre- and post-transplant immunizations using a tumor antigen vaccine (+ GM-CSF and montanide) led to vaccine-directed T-cell responses in about 1/3 of patients and enhanced recovery of polyclonal T and B cell counts and function. We hypothesized that addition of Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol\u00ae) \u2013 a TLR-3 agonistic vaccine adjuvant could increase tumor antigen vaccine responses through better priming and boosting. Methods: We report interim results of a Phase II clinical trial ( NCT01245673 ) evaluating safety and activity of autologous T cells primed in-vivo with a MAGE-A3 multipeptide vaccine (Orphan Drug Designation: GL-0817) mixed with GM-CSF and Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol\u00ae) +/\u2212 montanide. Inclusion criteria included measurable disease or high-risk cytogenetics. MAGE-A3 is expressed in \u223c50% MM cases and more frequently in relapsed/extramedullary/proliferative disease. The MAGE-A3 vaccine has 2 HLA-A2-restricted class I peptides and 1 promiscuous class II peptide linked to an HIV-1-TAT membrane translocation sequence (Trojan peptide) to enhance peptide presentation. Vaccine-primed T cells were collected by leukapheresis, costimulated and expanded ex-vivo using anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAb conjugated beads. T-cells were infused at day +2 after ASCT followed by booster immunizations at days 14, 42, 90, 120 and 150 post-transplant. Lenalidomide maintenance was started at day +100. Patients were evaluated for MM responses in accordance with IMWG criteria at days 60, 100, 180 post-transplant and Q3 months thereafter. T-cell and B-cell responses to the vaccine were evaluated by IFN-g or IL-2 cytokine production (all patients), dextramer binding to CD8 cells (HLA-A2 positive patients) and ELISA antibody assays at days 14, 60, 100 and 180 post-transplant. Results: 25 patients were transplanted on study. At a median followup of 6 months (range 2\u201318 months), 24 patients are surviving while 1 patient relapsed at about day +60 and died. Four additional patients have relapsed at 7,9,18 and 18 months post-transplant, yielding a 1-year Kaplan-Meier EFS of 77%. Of the 16 patients evaluable for response at day 100, 7/16 (44%) had CR/nCR using the study enrollment (post-induction) myeloma markers as a baseline while at day 180, 7/13 (53%) had CR/nCR. T-cell infusions were well-tolerated with no probable/definite grade 3 or higher toxicities. Vaccinations were associated with > 50 mm injection site reactions (redness, induration or both) after 1 or more immunizations in the majority of patients. Two patients developed large and prolonged inflammatory reactions which evolved into sterile abscesses. These resolved over 2\u20133 months with conservative management but as a result montanide was eliminated from the vaccine formulation for patients 11\u201325. Thereafter vaccine reactogenicity was decreased with no additional sterile abscesses. Of 16 patients tested for immune responses to date, 2 patients were unevaluable due to poor sample viability. Dextramer staining demonstrated MAGE-A3-specific CD8 T-cells in 4/4 (100%) of evaluable HLA-A2+ patients. Cytokine production in response to MAGE-A3 stimulation was seen in 11/14 (79%) patients; responses usually peaked at day 100 or day 180. Robust MAGE-A3 antibody responses were detected in 7/9 patients who received montanide in the vaccine formulation but in 0/7 patients who did not. Conclusions: Combination immunotherapy using a MAGE-A3 multipeptide tumor antigen vaccine plus vaccine-primed and costimulated autologous T-cells after ASCT for MM is well-tolerated and associated with encouraging early clinical responses. The addition of Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol\u00ae) to the vaccine formulation was associated with a high frequency of post-ASCT T-cell functional responses. The combination of Poly-ICLC +GM-CSF + Montanide led to robust injection site reactions that were occasionally severe and prolonged. Elimination of the montanide reduced injection site reactogenicity but may also have compromised the B-cell responses to the tumor antigen vaccine.
