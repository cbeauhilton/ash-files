    "abstract_text": "Background: The conserved Aurora family kinases, a family of mitotic serine/threonine kinases, have three members (Aurora-A, -B and -C) in mammalian cells. The Aurora kinases are involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression, and alterations in their expression have been shown to associate with cell malignant transformation. Aurora A localizes to the centrosomes during anaphase, and it is required for mitotic entry. Aurora B regulates the formation of a stable bipolar spindle-kinetochore attachment in mitosis. The function of Aurora-C in mammalian cells has not been studied extensively. In this study, we investigated that human leukemia cells expressed all 3 Aurora kinases at both protein and mRNA level, and the mechanisms of cell cycle regulation by knock down of Aurora C in leukemia cells. Methods: In this study, we used the 7 human leukemia cell lines, K562, NB4, HL60, U937, CEM, MOLT4, SUP-B15 cells. The expression levels of mRNA and proteins of Aurora kinases were evaluated by RT-PCR and western blot. The analysis of proliferation and cell cycle were performed by MTT assay and FCM, respectively. Results: The mRNA of Aurora-A and Aurora-B are highly expressed in human leukemia cell lines (K562, NB4, HL60, U937, CEM, MOLT4, SUP-B15 cells), while the mRNA of Aurora C is not only expressed highly in all cells. In contrast, an increase in the protein level of the 3 kinases was found in all cell lines. These observations suggested posttranscriptional mechanisms, which modulate the expression of Aurora C. In cell cycle analysis by flow cytometory, the knock down of Aurora C by siRNA induced G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in leukemia cells, and increased the protein levels of p27Kip1 and decreased Skp2 by western blot. In MTT assay, it was revealed that the growth inhibition of leukemia cells transfected with siRNA Aurora C compared with leukemia cells untransfected with siRNA Aurora C. Moreover, We showed that Aurora C was associated with Survivin and directly bound to Survivin by immunoprecipitation and western blot. Conclusion: We found that human leukemia cells expressed all 3 members of the Aurora kinase family. These results suggest that the Aurora kinases may play a relevant role in leukemia cells. Among these Aurora kinases, Aurora C interacted with Survivin and prevented apoptosis of leukemia cells, and induced cell cycle progression. Our results showed that Aurora-C may serve as a key regulator in cell division and survival. These results suggest that the Aurora C kinase may play an important role in leukemia cells, and may represent a target for leukemia therapy.",
