    "abstract_text": "Abstract Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematology malignant disease originated from B-cell line and still incurable. Compound Kushen Injection (CKI) as a Traditional Chinese Medicines are promising agents in our previous research for treating cancer. The effect of CKI on multiple myeloma was still unknown. Methods: In vitro experiment, flow cytometry was used to evaluate effect of CKI on multiple myeloma cells. Optofluidic chip was applied to detect effect at single-cell level. And in vivo RPMI-8226 GFP + B-NSG mouse model was built to assess the role of CKI in multiple myeloma treatment. Results: CKI inhibited MM cells proliferation of and increased its apoptosis rate. And the cell cycle of MM cells was also arrested by CKI treatment. In contrast, CKI has few toxic effects on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MC3T3 cells. At the single-cell level, MM cells was died in time and dose dependent manner. Transcriptome find that the expression of MYC and TERT in CKI-treated RPMI-8226 cells was significantly down-regulated and confirmed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Overexpression of TERT can partly reverse the inhibition effect of CKI on RPMI-8226 cells. B-NSG mouse was injected with GFP + RPMI-8226 cells through caudal vein, and the disease was partially alleviated by decreased tumor burden in the CKI-treated group. Furthermore, it is surprising that in animal models with myeloma bone disease, the bone mass was higher in CKI treatment group than control. Conclusions: CKI inhibits MM cells through the MYC/TERT signaling pathway and improve the quality of life of MM mouse. Our findings provide preclinical evidence to show that CKI could be a promising candidate in human MM therapy. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
