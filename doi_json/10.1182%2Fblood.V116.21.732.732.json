    "abstract_text": "Abstract 732 T reg cells have been recognized as critical regulators of the immune response and shown to prevent the development of GVHD. However, little is known about of the role of STAT1 signaling in T reg cells during the development of GVHD. In this study, we tried to investigate how STAT1 signaling controls donor T reg development and function in the setting of GVHD. For this purpose we studied the role of STAT1 in natural and inducible T reg (nT reg and iT reg , respectively). To better understand the influence of STAT1-deficiency on the proliferation of nT reg cells, purified splenic STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 or STAT1 +/+ CD4 + CD25 + cells were labeled with Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and cultured on anti-CD3 coated plates in the presence of anti-CD28 and IL-2 for 3 days and analyzed for proliferation and viability. After 72h of in vitro culture 50% of the STAT1 +/+ starting population were no longer viable compared to only 10% of STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 cells. Furthermore, we noted a significantly increased expansion of STAT1-deficient CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T reg cells compared to STAT1 +/+ T reg cells (p<0.001). In line with these findings, STAT1-deficiency resulted in a significantly higher proportion of CFSE lo cells indicating vigorous proliferation (85% Foxp3 + CFSE lo in STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 compared to only 65% Foxp3 + CFSE lo in STAT1 +/+ T reg cells. Furthermore, at the end of the culture 30% of the STAT1 +/+ CD4 + CD25 + population were Foxp3-negative compared to only 10% of the STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 cells. We next determined the impact of STAT1 on the generation of iT reg cells in vitro . For this purpose CD4 + CD25 \u2212 cells from STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 or STAT1 +/+ mice were cultured for 3 days on anti-CD3 coated plates in the presence of anti-CD28 antibodies, hTGF-\u03b2, mIL-2, anti-IFN-\u03b3 and anti-IL-4 for 3 days. Compared to STAT1 +/+ , we observed significantly enhanced generation of iT regs from STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 splenocytes (19.9%\u00b13.0% vs. 10.6%\u00b11.3%, p=0.008). We then performed studies to assess the in vivo generation of iT reg . For that purpose BALB/c mice were reconstituted with T Cell Depleted (TCD) 129.STAT1 +/+ Bone Marrow Cells (BMC) following lethal irradiation and recipients were co-injected with CD4 + CD25 \u2212 cells purified from either 129.STAT1 +/+ or 129.STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 splenocytes. We again noted a significantly higher proportion of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + cells in recipients of CD4 + CD25 \u2212 STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 cells compared to recipients of STAT1 +/+ T cells indicating a significantly increased conversion of CD4+CD25- cells into T reg cells. To confirm the in vitro results we tested the functional ability of in vitro expanded (using anti-CD3, anti-CD28, IL-2 and TGF-\u03b2) STAT1 +/+ or STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 T reg cells to block induction of GVHD. GVHD was induced in BALB/c mice following lethal irradiation (800rad) and fully MHC-mismatched BMT using 129.STAT1 +/+ bone marrow cells plus 129.STAT +/+ conventional T cells (T con ). Animals were co-injected with expanded T reg cells from either 129.STAT1 +/+ or 129.STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 donors at a ratio of 1:1 or 1:4 (T reg :T con ). STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 or STAT1 +/+ T reg cells were equipotent in completely preventing GVHD mortality. However, compared to recipients of STAT1 +/+ T reg recipients of STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 T reg showed reduced signs of GVHD morbidity as determined by a significantly improved weight development. Furthermore, recipients of STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 T reg showed significantly increased donor cell engraftment compared to recipients of STAT1 +/+ T reg (donor CD4 + [87% vs. 60%, p=0.03], CD8 + [99% vs. 96%, p=0.04], Mac1 + [96% vs. 77%, p=0.02] and B220 + [100% vs. 96%, p=0.007]) cells in the recipient spleen. These observations clearly demonstrate that STAT1 is a critical regulator of T reg cell development and expansion and that targeting STAT1 in CD4 + T cells may facilitate in vitro and in vivo generation/expansion of T reg cells for therapeutic use in GVHD while also promoting donor cell engraftment.
