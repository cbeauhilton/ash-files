    "abstract_text": "Congenital sideroblastic anemias (CSAs) are uncommon inherited diseases resulting from defects in heme biosynthesis, mitochondrial translation or mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly. CSAs are characterized by pathological mitochondrial iron deposits in bone marrow erythroblasts. Recently, mutations in mitochondrialheat shock protein 70 (HSPA9), a critical chaperone involved in mitochondrial ISC assembly, have been reported as a cause of non-syndromic CSA. Human heat shock cognate protein 20 (HSCB), a highly conserved mitochondrial co-chaperone, is the primary binding partner of HSPA9. HSCB allows the transfer of nascent ISC to HSPA9 and stimulates its ATPase activity, promoting ISC transfer to target proteins. To identify novel genes responsible for CSA, we performed whole exome sequencing on more than 75 CSA probands and their family members. In one patient, a young woman, with pancytopenia characterized by a normocytic anemia with numerous bone marrow ringed sideroblasts, we identified two variants in HSCB : a paternally-inherited promoter variant (c.-134C>A) predicted to disrupt a conserved ETS transcription factor binding site, and a maternally-inherited frameshift (c.259dup, p.T87fs*27). A fibroblast cell-line derived from the proband showed a decrease in HSCB expression, but normal HSPA9 expression compared to healthy, unrelated controls. Impairment of ETS1-dependent transcriptional activation of the promoter variant was demonstrated in K562 cells transfected with an HSCB-luciferase reporter construct. K562 cells were also employed to determine if reduced expression of HSCB could result in impaired erythroid metabolism, maturation, or proliferation. K562 cells infected with shRNA directed against HSCB were deficient in multiple mitochondrial respiratory complexes, had abnormal iron metabolism and a defect of protein lipoylation, all consistent with defective ISC metabolism. In addition, both IRP1 and IRP2 expression were decreased and cell surface transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) expression was enhanced, suggesting disturbed cellular iron metabolism. Nevertheless, cells lacking HSCB partially retained an ability to respond to iron chelation and iron overload. Cells lacking HSCB lose their ability to hemoglobinize in response to sodium butyrate treatment (Figure 1A). This defect was confirmed in vivo using a morpholino strategy in zebrafish, as fish lacking HSCB are also unable to hemoglobize (Fig 1B). We generated an Hscb conditional mouse to better elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Heterozygous ( Hscb +/- ) animals have no discernable phenotype; however, null animals die prior to embryonic day E7.5. Thus, to avoid this lethality, we employed Vav-cre animals (Tg(Vav1-cre)1Graf) to evaluate the loss of HSCB specifically in the hematopoietic compartment. Hscb c/- Vav-cre + pups are pale and growth retarded compared to control littermates and die at approximately p10 with severe pancytopenia. To assess the loss of HSCB specifically in the erythroid lineage, we bred conditional animals to EpoR-cre (Epor tm1(EGFP/cre)Uk ) mice. Hscb c/- EpoR-cre + mice die at approximately E12.5 due to a complete failure of erythropoiesis (Figure 1C). Finally, temporally inducible, hematopoietic-specific deletion animals were generated by transplantation of fetal livers from Mx-Cre (Tg(Mx1-cre)1Cgn) positive Hscb c/- animals. After polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (pIpC) induction, global defects of hematopoiesis were observed in Mx-Cre + animals, leading to their death 3-weeks post-induction from profound pancytopenia. A transient siderocytosis was seen in the peripheral blood between days 6-8 post-pIpC. Flow cytometry using FSC-TER119-CD44 gating strategy confirmed the defect in erythropoiesis. Taken together, these data demonstrate that HSCB is essential for hematopoiesis; both whole animal and in vitro cell culture models recapitulate the patient's phenotype, suggesting that the two patient mutations are likely disease-causing.
