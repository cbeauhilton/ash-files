    "abstract_text": "Key steps in hematopoiesis and the expression of genes encoding hemoglobin subunits are critically dependent upon specific members of the GATA factor family of transcription factors. Our recent efforts have focused on elucidating how GATA factors select functional sites in chromatin and how they function combinatorially with additional regulatory factors. GATA motifs are often arranged in close proximity to E-boxes, and such composite elements commonly mediate GATA factor- and Scl/TAL1-dependent transcriptional responses. Only a small fraction of these composite elements in chromatin are occupied by GATA factors and Scl/TAL1, and a specific epigenetic signature distinguishes occupied versus unoccupied elements genome-wide. In the context of hemoglobin synthesis, we are using genetic and molecular approaches to dissect the multistep mechanism underlying the control of \u03b2-globin transcription. GATA-1-containing complexes assemble at the \u03b2-globin Locus Control Region (LCR) prior to the murine adult \u03b2 major promoter. Though the LCR physically interacts with the \u03b2 major promoter, this interaction is not required for the binding of several trans-acting factors to the LCR or the promoter. A hypomorphic mutation of the chromatin remodeler BRG1 limits the extent to which RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is recruited to the promoter and also abrogates the LCR-promoter interaction. Whereas looping is not required for assembly of the full complement of promoter complex components, looping is linked to the establishment of maximal levels of Pol II at the promoter. Collectively, these results provide insights into the relationship between, and importance of, individual steps in the multi-step activation mechanism. I will discuss progress on unraveling mechanisms underlying GATA-1-mediated activation of the adult \u03b2 -like globin genes as well as fundamental aspects of GATA factor function, which have broad relevance in diverse systems. promoter.
