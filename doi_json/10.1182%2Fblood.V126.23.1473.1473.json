    "abstract_text": "Purpose The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic value of bone marrow involvement (BMI) assessed by PET-CT in treatment-na\u00efve patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Patients and methods All patients from a single centre diagnosed as DLBCL between 2005 and 2014 had data extracted from staging PET-CT, bone marrow biopsy (BMB), and treatment records. The final diagnosis of BMI was defined as: (i) positive bone marrow biopsy; (ii) positive PET-BMI confirmed by guided biopsy or targeted MR imaging; (iii) concomitant disappearance of bone marrow uptake and uptake in other lymphoma lesions on PET-CT after R-chemotherapy. Results Of 169 patients, 20 patients (12%) had BMI on BMB, whereas 35 patients (21%) had positive BMI according to PET-CT findings (PET-BMI(+)). Thirty-three out of the 35 patients with PET-BMI(+) showed a focal pattern and 2 a diffuse pattern, respectively. In multivariate analyses, PET-BMI(+) remained significant for overall survival (OS) (HR 2.90, 95%CI 1.21\u22126.96, P =0.017) while progressive-free survival (PFS) was significant only in univariate analysis ( P <0.001) ( Table 1 ). Among patients with PET-BMI(+) at diagnosis (N=35), patients with SUVmax of bone marrow (SUVmax(BM)) more than 8.6 were significantly associated with high IPI score (3\u22125) ( P =0.002) and worse PFS and OS ( P =0.025 and P =0.002, respectively) ( Figure 1 ). In the 68 stage IV cases, three-year OS was higher for patients with negative PET-BMI (PET-BMI (\u2212)) than patients with PET-BMI(+) (84.2%\u00a1\u00c06.5% vs. 44.1%\u00a1\u00c08.6%, respectively; P =0.003) while PFS only shown a trend of statistic significance ( P =0.077) between the 2 groups, with estimates of 3-year PFS at 49.3%\u00a1\u00c09.2% and 28.6%\u00a1\u00c07.6%, respectively ( Figure 2 ). Among the 69 patients with inter-risk of IPI (2\u22123), patients with PET-BMI(+) (N=21) had significantly inferior PFS and OS than patients with PET-BMI(\u2212) (N=48) ( P =0.009 and P <0.001, respectively) ( Figure 3 ). Conclusions Our data raised several important issues about the predictive significance of BMI assessed by PET-CT in DLBCL: (i) The bone marrow status assessed by PET-CT is an independent predictor of OS independent of IPI; (ii) For baseline PET-BMI(+) patients, the optimal cutoff value of SUVmax(BM) to predict the survival outcomes was 8.6; (iii) In patients with stage IV disease, worse survival outcomes were observed in patients with BMI than that without BMI; (iV) Patients with PET-BMI(+) in the intermediate risk-group should be managed as high-risk group patients.
