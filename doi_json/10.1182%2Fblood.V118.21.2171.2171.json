    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2171 Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are a heterogeneous population of cells that accumulate during tumor progression in a process driven by soluble factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These cells contribute to the suppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment and interfere with the functions of cytotoxic anti-tumor T effector cells. To date, MDSC heterogeneity has presented a barrier to studying the properties of individual MDSC constituents in vivo . Herein, we find that GM-CSF, a cytokine that promotes the numeric and functional development of monocytes, granulocytes and dendritic cells, and is frequently used as a vaccine adjuvant, is also critical for the expansion of a monocyte-derived MDSC population characterized by the expression of CD11b and the chemokine receptor CCR2. We demonstrate that these cells mediate T cell suppression in a contact dependent fashion and via the function of Arginase and inducible nitric oxide synthase, consistent with known MDSC functions. CD11b+CCR2 negative cells do not have suppressive capability despite also being expanded numerically by the actions of GM-CSF. Utilizing a toxin-mediated ablation strategy that targets CCR2-expressing cells, we demonstrate that monocytic MDSCs regulate activated CD8 T cell entry into the tumor site in vivo , thereby limiting the efficacy of immunotherapy. Our results extend observations on the dual role of GM-CSF in both stimulation and suppression of tumor immunity and suggest therapeutic targeting of monocytic MDSC could enhance the outcomes of immunotherapy.
