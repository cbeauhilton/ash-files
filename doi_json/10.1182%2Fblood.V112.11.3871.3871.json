    "abstract_text": "Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is a key signaling intermediate that is activated by several cytokines that regulate hematopoiesis, including granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin 6, and stem cell factor (SCF). Studies using mice with Stat3 deletion targeted to hematopoietic cells have shown that Stat3 negatively regulates basal granulopoiesis but positively regulates emergency granulopoiesis. Stat3 also has been reported to promote B lymphocyte differentiation. Defining the hematopoietic functions of Stat3 is further complicated by the existence of two isoforms: full-length Stat3\u03b1 (p92), and truncated Stat3\u03b2 (p83). Stat3\u03b2 is derived from alternative mRNA splicing resulting in replacement of the C-terminal transactivation domain with 7 unique amino acids (CT7), which have been demonstrated to confer markedly prolonged nuclear retention. Homozygous Stat3\u03b1-deficient mice are not viable, whereas Stat3\u03b2-deficient mice survive to adulthood and are fertile, but have increased inflammatory responses compared to wild-type mice. We compared basal granulopoiesis and lymphopoiesis, as well as emergency granulopoiesis, in homozygous Stat3\u03b2-deficient mice (\u03b2\u0394/\u03b2\u0394), which express only Stat3\u03b1, vs. their wild-type (+/+) littermates. We found that \u03b2\u0394/\u03b2\u0394 mice were significantly leukopenic (2880 \u00b1 1260/ml v. 4600 \u00b1 1670/ml; p <0.05), with lower absolute neutrophil counts (ANC, 360 \u00b1 180/ml v. 800 \u00b1 380/ml, p <0.05) and B lymphocyte counts (780 \u00b1 470/ml v. 1830 \u00b1 1260/ml, p <0.05), compared to +/+ mice. Within the circulating B-lymphocyte population, the mature B220 hi /IgM \u2212 cells were most dramatically reduced (170 \u00b1 70/ml v. 480 \u00b1 350/ml, p <0.05). Percentages of myeloid and lymphoid cells in the spleen and bone marrow were not significantly different between \u03b2\u0394/\u03b2\u0394 and +/+ mice. Bone marrow from \u03b2\u0394/\u03b2\u0394 mice generated significantly fewer myeloid colonies (CFU-GM) compared to wild-type marrow (28 \u00b1 9 v. 42 \u00b1 8 colonies per 20,000 cells, p <0.05). Additionally, \u03b2\u0394/\u03b2\u0394 lineage-depleted bone marrow cells cultured in G-CSF and SCF produced significantly fewer CD11b + /Gr1 + myeloid cells compared to +/+ cells (52.8 \u00b1 6.5% v. 68.3 \u00b1 2.6%, p <0.05). In contrast, bone marrow from \u03b2\u0394/\u03b2\u0394 and +/+ mice produced equal numbers of pro-B colonies in CFU assays containing the lymphopoietic cytokine IL-7. Finally, as a test of emergency granulopoiesis, we administered a single dose of G-CSF (250 \u03bcg/kg subcutaneously) or an equal volume of PBS, and 24 hr later measured the ANC, percentage of CD11b + /Gr1 + myeloid cells in the bone marrow, and CFU-GM generation. Mice of both genotypes responded to G-CSF stimulation with increases in ANC, percent of myeloid cells within the marrow, and CFU-GM. Bone marrow from \u03b2\u0394/\u03b2\u0394 mice showed a larger G-CSF-induced increase in CFU-GM (PBS: 22 \u00b1 5 v. G-CSF: 39 \u00b1 1, p <0.05) compared to +/+ marrow (PBS: 24 \u00b1 14 v. G-CSF: 31 \u00b1 14, NS). Thus, Stat3\u03b2 positively regulates basal granulopoiesis in the bone marrow, and may negatively regulate emergency granulopoiesis. This pattern is the opposite of that seen with deletion of both Stat3 isoforms, indicating that Stat3\u03b1\u2019s function is to negatively regulate basal granulopoiesis and positively regulate emergency granulopoiesis. Stat3\u03b2 also positively regulates circulating B lymphocyte numbers, via a mechanism other than B lymphocyte production in the bone marrow.",
