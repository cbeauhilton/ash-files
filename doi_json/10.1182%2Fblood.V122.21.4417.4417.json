    "abstract_text": "Natural killer (NK) cells mediate anti-lymphoma activity by spontaneous cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) when triggered by rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) used to treat patients with B cell lymphomas. The balance of inhibitory and activating signals determines the magnitude of NK cell's efficacy by spontaneous cytoxicity. Using a killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) transgenic murine model, we show that blockade of the interface of inhibitory KIRs with MHC class I antigens on lymphoma by anti-KIR antibodies prevents a tolerogenic interaction and augments NK cell spontaneous cytotoxicity. In combination with anti-CD20 mAbs, anti-KIR treatment induces enhanced NK cell-mediated, rituximab-dependent cytotoxicity against lymphoma in vitro and in vivo in syngeneic and KIR transgenic murine lymphoma models. Specifically targeting murine NK cells in vitro , anti-Ly49C/I F(ab') 2 increased anti-CD20 mAb-mediated NK cell degranulation as measured by CD107a mobilization and interferon-\u03b3 release, as well as increased cytotoxicity as assessed by chromium release. In the syngeneic EL4-huCD20 lymphoma model, anti-Ly49C/I F(ab') 2 enhanced the anti-lymphoma activity of anti-CD20 mAb in vivo ( Fig 1A-1B ) and was NK cell-dependent with efficacy abrogated by NK cell depletion with anti-Asialo-GM1. To validate these observations and the potential efficacy of a fully human anti-KIR mAb (IPH2101, lirilumab), we demonstrated, in vitro, dose-dependent KIR2DL3 saturation and tumor lysis following blockade of KIR2DL3/HLA-C with lirilumab. In the transgenic KIR murine model, lirilumab therapy improved survival in an NK cell-dependent manner in both a prophylactic and therapeutic HLA + (221 HLA-Cw3) lymphoma model. In combination, lirilumab therapy synergistically enhanced rituximab's anti-lymphoma efficacy in vivo in an NK cell-dependent manner ( Fig 2A-C ).
