    "abstract_text": "Although initially identified over 85 years ago, Fanconi Anemia (FA) remains a fatal genetic disease. Patients with FA exhibit developmental malformations, bone marrow failure, and increased cancer susceptibility. Twenty-one FA genes cooperate in a genome stability pathway that is essential for repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and attenuation of replication stress. Cells derived from FA patients are hypersensitive to ICL-inducing agents such as Mitomycin C (MMC), a hallmark of FA. In addition, FA hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) show growth retardation and increased apoptosis culminating in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) exhaustion and bone marrow failure. The poor growth of HSPCs also poses a significant obstacle in gene therapy for FA patients. Moreover, unrepaired DNA damage increases genome instability and promotes leukemia and cancer. Of note, interventions to mitigate HSPC defects in FA do not exist, aside from allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Remarkably, we reveal here that loss of the adaptor protein Lnk (also called Sh2b3) suppresses FA associated phenotypes without further accelerating neoplastic transformation. LNK is a negative regulator of HSC self-renewal in part by attenuating cytokine signaling, in particular thrombopoietin (TPO)-activated JAK2 signaling in HSCs. Fancd2 -/- ;Lnk -/- mice exhibit increased phenotypic HSCs in comparison to wildtype (WT) animals. The reconstituting ability of Fancd2 -/- ;Lnk -/- HSCs is also largely restored to WT levels in serial transplantation assays. In addition, Lnk deficiency restored the growth and survival of FA HSPCs in ex vivo culture. More importantly, Lnk deficiency mitigated chromosomal aberrations associated with FA upon proliferation. To determine if Lnk deficiency mitigates ICL repair, we examined MMC sensitivity in primary HSPCs that were dually null for Lnk and FancD2. Our data suggest that LNK does not play an overt role in ICL repair. Rather, Lnk deficiency in HSPCs mitigated replication stress by stabilizing replication forks and reduces genome instability associated with FA. Hence, our data suggest that Lnk deficiency alleviates replication stress-induced DNA damage and genome instability, thereby restoring cell proliferation and survival of Fancd2 -/- HSPCs ex vivo and HSC functions in vivo. Last and importantly, we began to test if LNK inhibition restores human FA HSPCs. We first generated FA-like HSPCs by knocking down FANCD2 in normal umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34+ cells. Our results demonstrated that shRNA-mediated depletion of LNK in human CD34+ cells rescued progenitor cell numbers and growth in FA-like HSPCs. Take together, our findings reveal a previously unappreciated role of cytokine/JAK signaling in alleviating replication stress and promoting replication-associated genome maintenance. Our studies also illuminate replication stress as a major underlying origin of bone marrow failure in FA patients and have implications for therapeutic strategies to treat FA associated bone marrow failure.
