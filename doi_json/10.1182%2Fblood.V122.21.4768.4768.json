    "abstract_text": "Background The major adverse effect of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) is the increased risk for bleeding complications. In addition to well-identified risk factors such as age, prior gastrointestinal tract bleeding, or hypertension, the intensity of anticoagulation evaluated by the International Normalized Ratio (INR) measurement is a major determinant of VKA-induced bleeding. However, for the same degree of VKA overcoagulation and comorbidities, some patient will bleed, whereas others remain asymptomatic. Therefore, identifying specific biological markers that identify patients at high risk of bleeding would have great clinical impact. Microparticles, derived from different cellular origins (endothelium, red blood cells, leukocytes, platelets or apoptotic tissues), can be detected in plasma and express procoagulant phospholipids (PPL). The presence of PPL has been associated with various diseases complicated by an hypercoagulable state. Therefore, we hypothesize that the procoagulant activity of PPL could protect against haemorrhage in patients with VKA overcoagulation. Patients and methods 53 consecutive patients who were referred to the emergency department of our institution and with an INR > 5 were enrolled in the study: 22 (10 females; 12 males, median age 82 years) were symptomatic (20 cases of minor bleeding, 2 cases of non-fatal major bleeding), whereas 31 (18 females, 13 males, median age 78 years) were asymptomatic. Median INR was 7.36 (range: 5 \u2013 22.6) and 6.3 (range: 5 \u2013 10.7) in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, respectively (p = 0.17, not significant). PPL were evaluated using a factor Xa-based coagulation assay (STA-Procoag-PPL, Diagnostica Stago) in which shortened clotting times are associated with increased levels of PPL. We also quantified thrombomodulin (TM) by an ELISA assay (Asserachrom Thrombomodulin, Diagnostica Stago) and by a functional assay based on the ability of TM to activate Protein C in the presence of thrombin, since high plasma levels of TM were previously identified as a predictor of bleeding complications. Results Clotting times were significantly lower in asymptomatic patients than in bleeding patients [respective median values 36.5 seconds (range: 27.1 \u2013 72.2) and 47.2 seconds (range : 30.5 \u2013 72.8); p = 0.03. In contrast, there were no significant differences for TM levels, whatever the assay used (functional or immunological). Conclusion Increased PPL could contribute to decrease the haemorrhagic risk of patients treated by VKA. It is not clear if the decrease of PPL is directly responsible of the hemorrhagic syndrom, or if PPL are decreased because of a consumption during the hemorrhagic episode. In order to answer this question, it could be of interest to analyse if a prospective follow-up of this parameter could help to identify patients with an increased hemorrhagic risk when treated by VKA.
