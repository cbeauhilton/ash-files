    "abstract_text": "Background: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of heterogeneous myeloid clonal disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, refractory anemia, and a tendency to transform to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ineffective hematopoiesis progression and immune deregulation are dominating pathophysiological process of MDS. Emerging evidences showed the role of bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in MDS. In MDS murine model, integral BM microenvironment contributes to inferior hematopoietic function and disease progression. As an important component of BM microenvironment, the relationship between endothelial cells (ECs) and MDS progression remains largely unknown. Although ECs from MDS patients have been identified to have decreased supporting ability to normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the supporting ability of ECs in different clinical stages of MDS remains to be elucidated. In addition, the role of BM ECs from MDS patients in supporting leukemia cells and their immunomodulatory ability remains unclear. Aims: To determine the number and functions of BM ECs in different subtypes of MDS patients. Moreover, to explore the correlation between BM ECs and MDS progression, which may represent a potential therapeutic target for MDS patients. Methods: In the prospective cohort study, patients with multilineage dysplasia (MDS-MLD, N=15), MDS with excess blasts (MDS-EB, N=15), or AML(N=15) and healthy donors (HD, N=15) were enrolled. BM ECs were analyzed in HD and patients by flow cytometry and in situ histological analyses. The functions of BM ECs were analyzed by migration, angiogenesis capacities, levels of apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS). To evaluate the supporting abilities of BM ECs on HSCs, leukemia cells and T cells, in vitro co-culture strategies were used. The levels of apoptosis, ROS and colony-forming unit-plating (CFU) efficiency of CD34+ and HL-60 cells were investigated. T cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry as previously reported. To further investigate the underlying mechanism of dysfunctional ECs, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses and real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) were performed in BM ECs from HD and MDS patients with different subtypes. Results: In the current study, gradually increased BM ECs were observed from MDS-MLD, MDS-EB to AML patients. Furthermore, dysfunctional BM ECs were found with MDS progression, characterized by increased levels of migration, angiogenesis capacities, apoptosis and ROS. More importantly, BM ECs from MDS patients exhibited decreased supporting ability of HSCs whereas increased supporting ability of leukemia cells in vitro with MDS progression. After coculture with ECs, levels of apoptosis and ROS in CD34+ cells were increased whereas their CFU efficiency reduced. On the other hand, levels of apoptosis and ROS of HL-60 cells were decreased. The proliferation capacity and leukemia CFU efficiency of HL-60 cells after co-cultured with ECs were enhanced with MDS progression. Furthermore, following coculture with BM ECs, deregulated differentiation was demonstrated in T cell subsets, characterized by elevating proportion of Th2 and Treg and decreasing proportion of Th1 and Th17 with MDS progression. RNA-Seq showed that the expression profile of BM ECs from MDS-EB was closer to MDS-MLD, whereas that of MDS-EB was closer to AML. Different gene expression profiles indicated the expression of hematopoiesis and immune related genes increased in BM ECs with MDS progression. Mechanistically, the mRNA levels of CX CL12 , SCF and NFKB of ECs were increased with MDS progression. Summary/Conclusion: In summary, the number of BM ECs gradually increased, BM EC dysfunction more and more severe, and the supporting abilities of BM ECs on HSCs decreased, whereas on leukemia cells increased with MDS progression. Moreover, ECs regulated the differentiation of T cells into immune tolerant cells with MDS progression. Although further validation is required, these findings indicated that the improvement of BM ECs may represent a potential therapeutic approach for MDS patients.
