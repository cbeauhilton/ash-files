    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant neoplasm characterized by the clonal proliferation of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow (OM). The average age of patients diagnosed with MM is approximately 70 years, being relatively uncommon in younger individuals. Objective: To report a case of a young patient with multiple myeloma. Case Description: A 42-year-old male patient presented with continuous and progressive low back pain for 3 months, associated with adynamia, weight loss (10 kg), episodes of constipation and bleeding in the oral cavity in this period. Examinations at the first appointment revealed moderate anemia (Hb 7.4 g / dL), leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, and altered renal function (Cr 5.9 and Ur 178), chest tomography indicating vertebral fracture in T6, T11, L2 and L4. Referred for specialized follow-up, he performed electrophoresis of serum proteins with the presence of a monoclonal peak in the gamma globulin fraction. The immunofixation test confirmed monoclonality for IgA isotype and Kappa light chain (IgA / Kappa). The myelogram showed plasmacytosis of more than 50% of mononuclear cells in the bone marrow. He developed renal failure (with dosage of creatinine of 10.1 mg/ dL. and urea of 208 mg/dL) and hypercalcemia requiring dialysis therapy on the third day of hospitalization, having undergone chemotherapy with Bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone. During this period, infection by the multisensitive S. aureus in catheter occurred and, despite being treated with specific antibiotic therapy, it evolved with clinical worsening and hemodynamic instability and was referred to the Intensive Care Unit, going to death after 2 days. Conclusion: Young patients with MM may study with more aggressive characteristics. Despite the use of new therapeutic agents, more effective treatment strategies need to be studied more for patients in this age group. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
