    "abstract_text": "Background: Relapsed/refractory (r/r) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) remains a therapeutic challenge. Although cytarabine arabinoside (AraC) is the most active drug, constituting the backbone of a majority of r/r regimens, the benchmark response to therapy remains a dismal 17 to 20% (Burnett, Wetzler et al. JCO, 2011.). The immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide (Len), is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for multiple myeloma and myelodysplasia and has demonstrated activity as a single agent in AML at doses as high as 50 mg for 21 days (d) of a 28 d cycle (Blum et al, JCO, 2010.). Based upon this activity profile we developed a phase I study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Len in combination with AraC in patients with r/r AML. Methods: Eligible patients were older than 18 years(y), had r/r AML with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status better than 2 and adequate renal and hepatic function. Patients were excluded for active CNS disease, uncontrolled infections, congestive heart failure, adrenal insufficiency, anti-cancer therapy within 14 d of enrollment, or prior exposure to Len. All enrolled patients had to practice appropriate contraception. Patients received AraC 1.5 g/m 2 /d over 3 hours on d 1-5 of a 28 day cycle, with a plan for standard 3+3 Len dose escalation. Initial patients received Len 25 mg on d 6-10 (n= 3), subsequent patients received doses between 25 and 10 mg (dose de-escalation) on d 6-26 with 2 d of rest prior to the next cycle. Following induction, patients who had residual AML (>5%) could receive a second identical course of therapy, provided they demonstrated an improvement in blast percentage relative to baseline. Patients who achieved CR received maintenance with Len 10 mg/d continuously. A 12 patient expanded cohort was enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to assess efficacy. Responses were assessed by International Working Group Criteria for AML (Cheson B et al. JCO, 2003.). Patient Characteristics: Fifty-one patients were consented and 45 were treated on study, 32 of these were evaluable for response, all patients were evaluated for toxicity. Approximately half the patients were female (20/45). The median age was 66 y (range 33-82) and median WBC 2.42x10 9 /L (range 0.18-63.15). Four patients (8%) had an antecedent hematological disorder. By European LeukemiaNet criteria 2 patients (4%) had favorable risk disease, 8 (18%) were Int-1, 12(27%) were Int-2 and 11 (24%) were adverse risk; 12(27%) patients were not evaluable by ELN due to lack of karyotype or molecular data from diagnosis. Twelve patients had primary refractory AML. Results: The MTD for Len given on d 6-26 in combination with AraC at 1.5 g/m 2 /d x 5 d was 10 mg. Dose de-escalation from the starting dose of 25 mg on this schedule was required due to excess toxicity. The most commonly observed non-hematologic drug related adverse events seen on the study (all < grade 2 unless indicated) were nausea, increased liver function tests (>grade 3), rash (grade >3), hypokalemia (> grade 3) and fatigue. At the 25 mg dose level the dose limiting toxicity was rash, while patients enrolled at the 15 mg dose level experienced dose limiting elevation in LFTs, fatigue and bleeding. Five patients achieved a CR (16%), 5 demonstrated CRi (16%) and there were 3 hematological improvements (HI) for an overall response rate (CR+Cri+HI) of 41% (13/32). The median overall survival (OS) (95% confidence interval) for patients treated on study was 5.8 (2.5, 10.6) months and disease free survival was 3.4 (2.3, 6.2) months. Conclusions: Although prior interesting data support the activity of single agent high dose Len in r/r AML, our single institute phase I study of intermediate dose AraC followed by Len was associated with marked skin and other toxicities at the Len 25 mg dose level, precluding dose escalation to the historically more active 50 mg dose. The CR rate in this study was not dissimilar to previously reported responses with single agent or combination AraC based regimens. Issues of dose and schedule for this combination may have had a significant impact on the potential benefit for these two drugs in combination. Nevertheless, the overall low CR rate from this study does not suggest any superiority for this combination in comparison with the historical single agent response rate for intermediate dose AraC in r/r AML.
