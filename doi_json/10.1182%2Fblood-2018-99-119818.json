    "abstract_text": "The efferocytic receptor MerTK is expressed on monocytes/macrophages and facilitates tolerogenic T cell suppressive clearance of apoptotic cellular debris. Given the rapid cell turn-over in leukemia, we hypothesized that ongoing efferocytosis is leukemia-permissive and inhibition of MerTK on monocytes/macrophages will reverse T cell suppression leading to enhanced anti-leukemia immunity. To test this hypothesis, we inoculated mice with syngeneic murine BCR-ABL p185 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells, which do not express MerTK. The effects of MerTK inhibition were evaluated in wild-type (WT) mice treated daily with MRX-2843, a MerTK small molecule inhibitor, and in mice with a MerTK knockout mutation ( Mertk -/- ). Median survival was prolonged in WT mice treated with MRX-2843 (40 days) compared to vehicle treatment (20 days, p<0.01 ). In littermate Mertk -/- mice, all but one mouse survived without evidence of leukemia 150 days after inoculation ( p<0.0001 ). To explore the T cell suppressive effects of MerTK inhibition on CD11b+ monocytes/macrophages, we used flow cytometry to study ex vivo mixed cell cultures using Mertk -/- or WT murine splenocytes +/- ALL cells treated +/- MRX-2843. Co-culture with ALL cells for 24 (36.0%), 48 (34.9%) and 72 (36.6%) hours resulted in a significant increase in expression of co-inhibitory ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 on CD11b + cells compared to cultures without ALL cells (2.03%, 3.2% and 7.5%, p<0.0001 ), or cultures with ALL cells treated with MRX-2843 (8.3%, 15.3% and 9.5%, p<0.0001 ). Similarly, PD-L1/PD-L2 co-expression on CD11b + cells from Mertk -/- mice was not significantly altered in the presence (16.0%) or absence (7.0%) of ALL. Furthermore, there was no significant change in PD-L1/PD-L2 expression when Mertk -/- co-cultures were treated with MRX-2843 (12.6%). These findings were recapitulated in vivo . There was no change in PD-L1/PD-L2 expression on CD11b + cells from Mertk -/- mice inoculated with ALL (4.8% spleen; 0.8% marrow) compared to uninoculated Mertk -/- mice (7.2% spleen; 1.2% marrow) or uninoculated WT littermates (2.0% spleen; 0.7% bone marrow), whereas CD11b + cells from WT mice inoculated with ALL demonstrated a significant upregulation of PD-L1/PD-L2 (24.1% spleen, p<0.0001 ; and 4.2% bone marrow, p<0.001 ), which was downregulated upon treatment with MRX-2843 (1.9% spleen, p<0.01 ; 1.2% bone marrow, p<0.05 ) In these experiments, expression of PD-1, the co-inhibitory receptor which binds PD-L1/PD-L2, on T cells was also assessed. In WT mice inoculated with ALL, expression of PD-1 on T cells from spleens (74.2% CD4 + ; 49.2% CD8 + ) and bone marrow (65.9% CD4 + ; 73.0% CD8 + ) was significantly increased compared to spleens (10.0% CD4 + ; 4.1% CD8 + ) and bone marrow (36.4% CD4 + ; 8.5% CD8 + ) from uninoculated control mice ( p<0.0001 ). However, expression of PD-1 was not significantly different in spleens (28.3% CD4 + ; 7.2% CD8 + ) and bone marrow (66.2% CD4 + ; 29.2% CD8 + ) from Mertk -/- mice inoculated with ALL compared with spleens (20.0% CD4 + ; 4.7% CD8 + ) and bone marrow (62.2% CD4 + ; 12.4% CD8 + ) from uninoculated Mertk -/- mice. To determine whether changes in PD-1 expression were indicative of T cell activation or exhaustion, T cells treated with \u03b1-CD3 beads were added to splenocyte and ALL cell co-cultures for 24 hours and intracellular IFN-\u0263 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were assessed using flow cytometry. The fraction of T cells producing IFN-\u0263/TNF-\u03b1 significantly increased in co-cultures treated with MRX-2843 (44.2% CD4 + ; 51.1% CD8 + ) compared to vehicle-treated co-cultures (27.4% CD4 + , p<0.0001 ; 36.8% CD8 + , p<0.0001 ). Similarly, IFN-\u0263/TNF-\u03b1 production increased in co-cultures with Mertk -/- splenocytes and ALL cells (48.3% CD4 + , p<0.0001 ; 51.2% CD8 + , p<0.0001 ) compared to co-cultures with WT splenocytes and activation was not further augmented by treatment with MRX-2843 (48.9% CD4 + , 51.5% CD8 + ). Similar results were obtained when T cells from Mertk -/- mice were used, demonstrating that the effects of T cell activation were dependent on the presence of MerTK on CD11b + cells, but not T cells. In conclusion, inhibition of MerTK on CD11b + monocytes/macrophages reversed T cell suppression in response to leukemia via the PD-1 axis. MerTK inhibitors are in early phase clinical trials and these data demonstrate a potential immunotherapeutic use for MerTK inhibitors in the treatment of ALL.
