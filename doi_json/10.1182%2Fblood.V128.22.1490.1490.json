    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in specialized bone marrow microenvironments adjacent to endothelial cells (BM ECs). BM ECs regulate both HSC self-renewal and regeneration by expressing soluble growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF). EGF accelerates HSC regeneration following ionizing radiation injury ( Doan et al. , Nat Med , 2013), though its role in HSC reconstitution after chemotherapy is not yet defined. At 24 hours following administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), the expression of EGF receptor is increased 10-fold ( p <0.0001) compared to untreated control mice within ckit+Sca-1+Lineage- (KSL) cells. EGFR expression is preferentially induced 6.8-fold in KSL cells compared to whole bone marrow cells after 5-FU ( p =0.01). When C57Bl6 mice are treated with a single injection of 150 mg/kg 5-FU followed by daily injections of EGF for 4 days, they demonstrated preserved BM cellularity ( p =0.0003), increased BM EC density ( p =0.002), and contained higher levels of donor engraftment at 16-weeks post-secondary transplantation in competitive repopulating assays (mean 21.9% vs 52.2%, p =0.0005) compared to saline-treated control mice. Following a lethal dose of 5-FU, EGF-treated mice displayed 70% survival compared to 20% survival in saline-treated control mice ( p =0.04). These results suggest that EGF signaling may accelerate both hematopoietic progenitor and stem cell reconstitution following myelosuppressive and lethal-dose chemotherapy. Since the pro-apoptotic gene Bax is increased 2.8-fold in BM lin- cells following 5-FU compared to cells from untreated mice ( p <0.0001), we sought to determine whether chemo-protection of BM ECs via deletion of Bax would accelerate HSC reconstitution. We employed a genetic mouse model with Cre recombinase to delete Bax specifically in VECadherin-expressing ECs ( VECadherinCre;BaxFL /+ and VECadherinCre;BaxFL /FL mice). These mice displayed no differences in hematopoiesis at baseline. When C57Bl6 KSL cells are in non-contact co-cultures with BaxFL /+ BM ECs and treated with 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) + EGF for 48 hours, they displayed both increased colony-forming cells (CFCs) and decreased annexin+ cells compared to control cultures ( p =0.001 and p =0.03, respectively). Conversely, when C57Bl6 KSL cells are cultured with BaxFL/FL ECs and FdUMP + erlotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that neutralizes EGFR signaling, they displayed decreased CFCs and increased annexin+ cells compared to control cultures ( p =0.001 and p =0.0003, respectively). These data suggest that chemo-protection of BM ECs by deletion of Bax in vivo results in accelerated hematopoietic recovery. Following 5-FU, EGF promoted cell cycling with increased Ki67+ cells and cells in interphase (mean 4.8% vs 16.1%, p =0.03). Moreover, EGF decreased annexin+ cells within the KSL population both in vitro following FdUMP (mean 26.3 % vs 17%, p =0.002) and in vivo following 5-FU (mean 21.5% vs 11.5%, p <0.0001). Concordant with these results, KSL cells treated with FdUMP + EGF displayed lower levels of double-strand DNA (dsDNA) breaks, measured by \u03b3H2AX, compared to control cultures (mean 39% vs 16%, p <0.0001). Since EGF can repair dsDNA breaks via non-homologous end joining recombination, we measured the levels of phosphorylation of DNA pk cs. Following 24 hours with FdUMP and 15 minutes with EGF, KSL cells displayed a 4.8-fold increase in phospho-DNA pk cs (T2647) compared to control cultures ( p =0.04). Finally, we sought to determine whether EGF could accelerate HSC reconstitution via the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor. Following 5-FU + EGF, G-CSF-R expression is increased 3.6-fold in mRNA levels ( p <0.0001) and by flow cytometric analysis (mean 23.9% vs 42.4%, p =0.003) compared to 5-FU-treated mice. These results suggest that EGF may be a potent HSC growth factor and may exert its effect at least in part via G-CSF receptor signaling.
