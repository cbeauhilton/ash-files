    "abstract_text": "Anthracyclines, especially daunorubicin, play a very important role in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the relapsed ALL in childhood. In the present study, primary lymphoblasts isolated from 65 children with de novo ALL (median: 5.8 years; range: 1.9 \u2013 16.9 years) and relapsed ALL (median: 12.7 years; range: 1.3 \u2013 17.9 years) were treated with daunorubicin (10 mmol/l) or idarubicin (2 mmol/l) in vitro . We could show that both anthracylines induce apoptosis, as evidenced by measurement of genomic DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, daunorubicin only induced modest apoptosis, whereas idarubicin displayed a significantly stronger apoptosis inducing effect. Furthermore the treatment of daunorubicin-resistant lymphoblasts with idarubicin resulted in good response in most of the resistant cell populations. Out of the 65 patients analysed in this study 23 were female (13 de novo ALL, 10 relapsed ALL) and 42 were male (29 de novo ALL, 13 relapsed ALL). Primary lymphoblasts were obtained by bone marrow aspiration and separated by centrifugation over Ficoll. Within these cell populations following immunologic subgroups were found: 35 c-ALL, 10 pre-B-ALL, 7 pro-B-ALL, 10 T-ALL and 3 pre-T-ALL. Daunorubicin induced apoptosis in 33 out of 65 lymphoblast populations (response rate 50.8 %). Nevertheless, a far higher response rate was observed for idarubicin with 59/65 (90,8 %) (p < 0.008), if response is defined as apoptosis induction higher than 1 %. Daunorubicin-resistance was found in 32/65 (49,2 %), resistance to both was observed in 6/65 (9,2 %). Treatment of daunorubicin-resistant lymphoblasts with idarubicin resulted in significant apoptosis induction in 26 out of 32 cell populations (81,3 %). We clearly demonstrated here that the in vitro treatment of lymphoblasts from children with de novo or relapsed ALL with idarubicin induces significantly higher response rates than daunorubicin treatment. The ex vivo sensitivity of daunorubicin-resistant lymphoblasts of childhood ALL to idarubicin treatment reflects the better potency of idarubicin to induce apoptosis and to overcome daunorubicin resistance. These data prompted us to study the clinical relevance of idarubicin in ongoing clinical trials to improve existing therapeutic regiments. First clinical data point to a good tolerability of idarubicin in the treatment of relapsed ALL in childhood.",
