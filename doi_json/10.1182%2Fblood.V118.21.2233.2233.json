The mechanisms of ITP remain unclear although recent evidence suggests that megakaryocytes may be the target of immune destruction. To test this hypothesis we evaluated IgG-binding to megakaryocytes and B- and T-cells in bone marrow specimens of ITP patients and non-thrombocytopenic controls. METHODS: Histological slides of bone marrow biopsies from ITP patients and control patients were prepared from stored paraffin-embedded tissue blocks for blinded pathological assessment. Adult ITP patients (N=19) had a platelet count less than 100 x10 9 /L (range 2 \u2013 76 x10 9 /L) as measured within 4 weeks before the date of bone marrow biopsy procurement without splenomegaly, myelodysplastic syndrome, lymphoproliferative disease, HIV, hepatitis B or C, drug-induced thrombocytopenia or prior treatment with thrombopoietin receptor agonists or other hematopoietic growth factors. Control patients (N=15) were adults with limited stage lymphoma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance with a normal platelet count (150 \u2013 400 x10 9 /L) who had a bone marrow biopsy for staging purposes which was reported as normal. Patients with prior use of anti-neoplastic agents or hematopoietic growth factors were excluded. Coded bone marrow biopsy sections were labeled with rabbit polyclonal anti-IgG, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD20, and CD61 in serial sections, followed by streptavidin-biotin labeling techniques. The intensity of staining was assessed semi-quantitatively by an experienced hematopathologist for megakaryocyte, B-cell and T-cell numbers (increased, decreased, within normal limits) and megakaryocyte-bound IgG (negative, below 50% of cells positive or more than 50% of cells positive) blinded to diagnosis and platelet count. RESULTS: ITP bone marrows demonstrated greater IgG binding to megakaryocytes compared with controls [12/19 (63.16%) vs. 4/15 (26.67%), p=0.02], increased CD4+ cells [15/19 (78.95%) vs. 5/15 (33.33%), p=0.003] and marginally increased CD8+ cells [11/19 (57.89%) vs. 4/15 (26.67%), p=0.05]. B-cell numbers were not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Using bone marrow specimens from carefully selected ITP patients and controls, our study shows that IgG-bound megakaryocytes and T cells, especially T-helper cells, are increased in bone marrow of ITP patients compared with controls. These data provide evidence of megakaryocyte injury in ITP. Additional labeling with caspase-3 and TUNEL stains is planned to identify markers of apoptosis.
