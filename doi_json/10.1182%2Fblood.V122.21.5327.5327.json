    "abstract_text": "Introduction Little is known about the incidence and clinical features of Multiple Myeloma (MM) in Latin America. A clinical registry of Latin American (LA) patients with MM represents an opportunity to gain insight into the prevalence of the disease in this region, the patterns of care and the current treatment status in different LA countries. Objective To characterize the demographic and clinical features of patients with multiple myeloma from five LA countries (Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Peru) and to create a LA database on MM; in addition to investigating the patterns of care for MM patients in Latin America. Patients and Methods This is an observational, non-intervention study, with a prospective evaluation of data. Eligible patients were diagnosed with multiple myeloma, between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007, at any one of the participating centers, regardless of disease stage or treatment modality. The follow-up period extended to at least 5 years for each patient (December 31, 2012). Results Eight hundred and seventy six patients were included. The median age was 60 years old (25-97), 53.4% male and 46.6% female. The median follow-up was 31.4 months, and the median overall survival was 57 months. The median overall survival to patients who received high-dose chemotherapy was 77 months and for patients who received conventional chemotherapy was 48 months (p<0.001). The multivariate prognostic model included patient baseline variables that were associated with mortality in the Kaplan-Meier univariate analyses. Only hypercalcemia, DSS II and III, ISS stage III andnon- high-dose chemotherapy were independent predictors of mortality. Conclusion This current study, which is the largest case series of MM patients in Latin America, recognizes the feasibility of large, collaborative, observational studies among various tertiary-care hematology centers in Latin America. Note We will present more details related to the demographic and most frequently used treatments in Latin America for newly diagnosed and relapsed patients in these LA countries.
