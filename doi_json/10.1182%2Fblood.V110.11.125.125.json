    "abstract_text": "Background: We previously reported substantial activity with single-agent bortezomib (VELCADE\u00ae; Vc) in patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory MCL in the PINNACLE study ( JCO  2006 ; 24 : 4867 \u201374 ), which resulted in approval of Vc for MCL pts following \u22651 prior therapy. All pts have now completed treatment. Here we report updated time-to-event data in all pts, and by response category, with extended follow-up. Methods: 155 pts (median age 65 yrs; 55%/41%/4% with 1/2/\u22653 prior therapies; 77% Stage IV MCL; 55% positive bone marrow) received Vc 1.3 mg/m 2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of 21-day cycles; of these, 141 were response-evaluable. Response and progression were determined by modified International Workshop Response Criteria using independent radiology review. Results: After a median follow-up of 26.4 mo, 55 pts (35%) remained in follow-up; 93 (60%) had died, 2 (1%) had withdrawn consent, and 5 (3%) were lost to follow-up. Pts received a median of 4 treatment cycles (range 1\u201321; 8 in responding pts). Median time to first response was 1.3 months. Median duration of response (DOR) was 9.2 mo in all responders and has not been reached in pts achieving CR/CRu. Median time to progression (TTP), time to next therapy (TTNT; first Vc dose to start of next therapy), and overall survival (OS) are shown in the table for all pts and by response. Survival rate at 12-mo was 69% overall and 91% in responding pts. In pts refractory to their last therapy (no response or response with TTP <6 mo; n=58), median DOR was 5.9 mo, median TTP was 3.9 mo, median TTNT was 4.6 mo, and median survival was 17.3 mo. Safety profile was similar to previously reported; most common grade \u22653 AEs were peripheral neuropathy (13%), fatigue (12%), and thrombocytopenia (11%). The most common AE resulting in Vc discontinuation was peripheral neuropathy (10%). Twelve (8%) pts died on-study, including 5 (3%) considered related to Vc. Conclusions: Vc provides durable responses plus prolonged time off-therapy and survival in responding pts, suggesting substantial clinical benefit in relapsed/refractory MCL.
