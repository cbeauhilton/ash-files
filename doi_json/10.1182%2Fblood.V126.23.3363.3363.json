    "abstract_text": "Background Recommendations on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) for the management of chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA) are well established (Schrijvers D et al. Ann Oncol 2010;21[suppl 5]:v244-7). Iron supplementation can further improve treatment response of CIA, particularly in the case of iron deficiency (Pedrazzoli P et al. J Clin Oncol 2008;26:1619-25; Auerbach M et al . J Clin Oncol 2004;22:1301-7), but is under-used. Objective To evaluate the effect of epoetin alfa biosimilar, with or without iron, on CIA in current oncology and hematology practice. Methods SYNERGY was an observational, longitudinal, prospective, multicenter study conducted in France, from a representative, random sample of oncologists and hematologists. Patients of these clinicians were aged \u226518 years with solid tumors, lymphoma and/or myeloma and CIA, eligible for treatment with epoetin alfa biosimilar and followed for 12-16 weeks. A subanalysis describing the treatment response to epoetin alfa biosimilar in patients with/without iron supplementation and their target hemoglobin (Hb) levels is presented here. Results Overall, 2167 patients were enrolled by 195 French oncologists/hematologists during June 2012-December 2014. The analysis included 2076 patients, of whom half were male. At inclusion, mean age \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) was 67\u00b112 years and 75.7% (n=1517) of patients had a World Health Organization performance status of 0 or 1. Most patients had not received any blood transfusions (90.0%, n=1867) or ESAs (93.1%, n=1932) in the year before the inclusion visit. A total of 31.6% (n=655) patients received iron supplementation, of whom 58.9% (n=386) received intravenous (IV) iron, 40.5% (n=265) had oral iron and 0.6% (n=4) were prescribed both oral and IV iron. An iron status assessment was more common in patients who were given iron supplementation, while over a third of patients who did not have an iron status were prescribed iron (Table). At follow-up, over 70% of patients had a maximum Hb level above 11 g/dL, regardless of iron status (Table). For patients with and without added iron, the mean change in Hb level was 2.26 g/dL and 2.22 g/dL at maximum during the study and 1.71\u00b11.52 g/dL and 1.59\u00b11.60 g/dL at final visit, respectively. Iron status results were used to define patients as having absolute iron deficiency (coefficient of saturation of transferrin [CST] <20% and ferritin <100 \u03bcg/100 mL), functional iron deficiency (CST <20% and ferritin \u2265100 \u00b5g/100 mL) or no deficiency (CST \u226520%). The majority of patients with no iron supplementation had no deficiency compared with a minority of patients with iron supplementation (Table). Patients with absolute iron deficiency given iron supplementation responded better to epoetin alfa biosimilar (increase of \u22651 g/dL since enrollment or increase of \u22652 g/dL, in the absence of transfusion in the 3 previous weeks) than those not given iron supplementation (74.5% vs 65.5%, p=0.403). Similar results were observed for patients with added IV iron. Table 1.  . Iron supplementation . No iron supplementation .

Iron supplementation improved the response to epoetin alfa biosimilar in patients with an absolute iron deficiency, suggesting that iron status can be used to optimize treatment of patients with CIA with ESAs and iron supplementation.
