    "abstract_text": "Basophils and mast cells are multifunctional hematopoietic effectors that co-operate to mount a variety of allergic and innate immune responses. Their origin and developmental relationships, however, have not yet been resolved, and remain as one of the major issues in the biology of hematopoiesis. Here we report that progenitors bipotent for basophils and mast cells(basophil/mast cell progenitors: BMCPs) are prospectively isolatable within murine spleen. We have shown that the \u03b27-integrin(\u03b27) is an essential molecule for tissue-specific homing of putative precursors for intestinal mast cells ( J Exp Med  194 : 1243 , 2001 ). To identify a candidate population that seeds intestinal progenitors for mast cells, we searched for \u03b27 + cells in the bone marrow and the spleen. Lin \u2212 c-Kit + spleen cells contained a fraction of cells expressing \u03b27 at high levels. They also expressed Fc\u03b3RII/III, but the majority of these cells did not express Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1. These Lin \u2212 c-Kit + Fc\u03b3RII/III + \u03b27 hi Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 \u2212/lo cells exclusively differentiated into mature mast cells and basophils. Strikingly, single Lin \u2212 c-Kit + Fc\u03b3RII/III + \u03b27 hi Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 \u2212/lo cells formed colonies containing both basophils and mast cells as well as pure mast cell or basophil colonies. We thus named these cells as BMCPs. In 2-day cultures, purified BMCPs upregulated Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1, giving rise to Lin \u2212 CD34 + Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 hi c-Kit + and Li \u2212 CD34 + Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 hi c-Kit \u2212 blastic cell populations, and they differentiated exclusively into mast cells and basophils, respectively. Based on this phenotype, we searched for precursors committed to either lineage in vivo. The Lin \u2212 CD34 + bone marrow cells contained Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 hi c-Kit \u2212 cells, which differentiated exclusively into basophils. We named this population as basophil progenitors (BaPs). Since mast cell progenitors(MCPs) were not isolatable as a distinct population in the bone marrow or the spleen, we searched for MCPs in the intestine. We newly identified CD45 + Li \u2212 CD34 + \u03b27 hi Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 lo cells in the intestine, and these cells exclusively formed pure mast cell colonies, which were named as intestinal MCPs. Since the expression of C/EBP\u03b1 was dramatically increased in BaPs but was downregulated in MCPs, we hypothesized that it plays a key role in the basophil versus the mast cell lineage commitment. To test this hypothesis, we disrupted or overexpressed C/EBP\u03b1 at the BMCP stage. BMCPs disrupted with C/EBP\u03b1 gave rise exclusively to mast cells, while, BMCPs overexpressing C/EBP\u03b1 differentiated mainly into basophils, suggesting that C/EBP\u03b1 plays a primary role in deciding the basophil vs. mast cell fate at the BMCP stage. Thus, differentiation of the BMCPs into committed progeny may lead to selective migration, BaPs to the bone marrow or MCPs to peripheral tissues, and this fate decision is controlled principally by C/EBP\u03b1. These newly identified progenitors should be useful to analyze the mechanism of commitment into each of these lineages, and could also be therapeutic targets for a variety of allergic and autoimmune disorders."
