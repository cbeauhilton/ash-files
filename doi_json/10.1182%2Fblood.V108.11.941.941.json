    "abstract_text": "Background. Platelets (plt) prepared for transfusion contain multiple molecules that modulate immune function, mediate acute transfusion reactions, induce immune responses, and affect hemostasis. These cytokines/chemokines are secreted differentially from plt during storage ( Transfusion  2006 ; 46 : 1184 ), and may be affected by processing, including pathogen inactivation. Aims. The INTERCEPT Blood System (IBS) for platelets utilizes amotosalen-HCl (S-59) with ultraviolet A (UVA) light to inactivate a broad spectrum of pathogens and leukocytes. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of photochemical treatment on in vitro release of immune modulation molecules after processing during 7 days (d) of storage. Methods. Platelet concentrates (n = 10) collected by aphaeresis (CPA) with process leuko-reduction (< 10 6 ) containing 8.15x10 11 \u00b1 0.8 platelets were suspended in 35% donor plasma and 65% platelet additive solution (Intersol, Baxter, France) and divided into two equal components. One served as an untreated control (C) and the other was prepared with 150 uM amotosalen and a 3 J/cm 2 UVA photochemical treatment (PCT) and stored at 22\u00b0C with shaking for 7 days. Platelet concentration (10 6 /uL), pH and levels of immune modulation factors were measured: CD62p(ng/mL), PDGF-AB(ng/mL), IL8(pg/mL), sCD40L(pg/mL), IL1\u03b2(pg/mL) and TNF\u03b1(pg/mL). The concentration of each factor was determined by specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assays in plt and supernatant (s) fractions isolated from stored PCT and C plt components. Mean values \u00b1 SD were calculated and compared by paired t-test. Results. Platelet content, pH and cytokine/chemokine content and release from CPA prepared with photochemical treatment were not statistically different (p > 0.05) from C during 7 d of storage (Table). From d1 to d7, the pH of PCT and C units decreased similarly, but remained within acceptable ranges. No detectable IL1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 were observed in PCT or C CPA. During platelet storage CD62p, PDGF-AB, IL8, and sCD40L increased similarly in supernatants of PCT and C units. The increase in supernatant levels correlated with a decrease of these cytokines in plt. Platelets in PCT and C retained measurable levels of CD62, IL8, sCD40L and PDGF-AB though 7 d. Levels of sCD40L demonstrated marked variation. Conclusions. Cytokines increased moderately in the supernatants of CPA and decreased in platelets during storage. After 7 d C and PCT platelets in CPA retained detectable levels of cytokines. PCT had no differential influence on release of immune modulation molecules in vitro over 7 d of storage.  Day . O .
