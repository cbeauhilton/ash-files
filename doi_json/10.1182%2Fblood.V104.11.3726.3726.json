    "abstract_text": "Hydroxyurea (HU) is now widely used in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD). The effect of this agent on T-lymphocytes in this disease has not been extensively studied. In other diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, HU was found to have a variable effect on T-cell subsets. We previously reported ( Blood  2002 ; 100 : 363 ) a case of a sickle cell disease patient who was HIV- negative who was found to have low CD4 count on HU that normalized after stopping this agent. We have since conducted a case-controlled study in our sickle cell disease clinic in an attempt to analyze the effects of HU on CD4 count and other T-lymphocyte subsets. Written informed consent was obtained from 15 SCD patients. All patients had SCD as confirmed by hemoglobin electrophoresis. We placed patients into 2 cohorts: the treatment group consisted of patients already receiving HU therapy and the control group consisted of patients not taking HU. Among 15 patients, 8 patients were in treatment group and 7 patients were in the control group. In control group, 5 patients were female and 2 patients were male with mean age of 38 years. In treatment group, 7 patients were female and 1 was male with mean age of 35 years. In the treatment group, the mean duration of HU therapy was 4 years. We collected venous blood from all patients and tested for the following blood cell counts: total white blood cell (WBC), total neutrophil, total lymphocyte, CD4, CD8, CD3 cells and CD4/CD8 ratio. We also tested and found that there was no significant difference between the 2 cohorts for the presence of alloantibodies, cytomegalovirus virus and hepatitis C viral status. All patients were found to be HIV- negative. The lymphocyte assay was done using Coulter MAXAM hematology analyzer and using a combination of white blood cell counts and differential count in the same laboratory for all patients. We compared the mean value of total T-lymphocyte counts, T-cell subgroups CD4, CD8, CD3 levels and CD4/CD8 ratios between the 2 groups by performing the t-test (Table 1). Our study showed that the treatment group had a statistically significant increase in total T- lymphocyte count and in levels of the CD4, CD8 and CD3 levels compared to the control group. There was no difference in the CD4/CD8 ratio between the 2 groups. These results provide additional information to our previous observation of a lowered CD4 count in a SCD patient on HU. These results are consistent with findings in HIV positive patients where changes in T- lymphocytes subsets have been observed in patients treated with HU ( AIDS  2002 ; 14 : 619 \u2013621 and J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr  2000 ; 25 : 329 \u2013336 ). We conclude that in SCD patients HU can affect T-lymphocyte subset counts. The mechanism and clinical significance of the effect, if any, is unknown and requires further investigation.
