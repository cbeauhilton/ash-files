    "abstract_text": "Abstract 848 Introduction: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) arises from a malignant stem cell population that is resistant to cytotoxic therapy and represents a critical reservoir of conferring disease recurrence. A major focus of investigation is the identification of unique markers on leukemia stem cells (LSCs) that differentiate them from normal hematopoietic stem cells and thereby serve as potential therapeutic targets. MUC1 is a high molecular weight transmembrane glycoprotein that is aberrantly expressed in many epithelial tumors and confers cell growth and survival. We have developed an inhibitor of the MUC1-C receptor subunit that blocks oligomer formation and nuclear localization. In the present study, we have examined expression of MUC1 on LSCs as compared to normal hematopoietic stem cells and studied the effect of MUC1-C inhibition on the functional properties of LSCs. Methods and Results: Using multichannel flow cytometric analysis, we isolated the LSC compartment as defined by CD34+/CD38-/lineage- cells from bone marrow specimens obtained from patients with active AML. The majority of LSCs strongly expressed MUC1 with a mean percentage of 77% (n=6). These findings were confirmed by immunocytochemical staining of LSCs isolated by flow cytometric sorting. MUC1 expression was not detectable on the CD34- fraction of AML cells, but was present on the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) fraction (CD34+/CD38+ cells) (mean=83%; n=6). In contrast, MUC1 expression was not observed on CD34+ progenitors isolated from normal donors (18%, n=6). In concert with these findings, RT-PCR analysis for MUC1 RNA demonstrated expression in CD34+ cells isolated from AML patients, but not normal volunteers. Notably, we also found that MUC1 expression selectively identifies malignant hematopoietic progenitors in a patient with chimerism between normal and leukemia derived stem cells. The presence of MUC1+CD34+ cells was detected in a patient with AML who achieved a morphologic complete remission following sex mismatched allogeneic transplantation. Using Bioview technology, we found that MUC1 is expressed only in the recipient (XX) CD34+ cells, representing residual malignant cells, whereas the donor (XY) derived CD34+ cells, representing the majority of the progenitors, lacked MUC1 expression. We subsequently examined the effects of MUC1-C inhibition on the capacity of leukemic progenitors to proliferate and support colony formation. MUC1-C inhibition with the GO-203 cell-penetrating peptide resulted in downregulation of the \u03b2-catenin pathway, an important modulator of cell division and survival, which is known to support the LSC phenotype. No significant change was detected with a control peptide, or with MUC1-C inhibition of progenitors isolated from a normal control. Furthermore, MUC1-C inhibition resulted in apoptosis, as demonstrated by flow cytometric staining for AnnexinV in AML CD34+ cells, but not in CD34+ progenitors isolated from normal volunteers (mean Annexin positive cells 53% and 5%, respectively, n=4). Consistent with these findings, the MUC1-C inhibitor, but not the control, peptide resulted in cell death of CD34+ cells isolated from AML patients, but not normal controls. Most significantly, exposure of CD34+ AML cells to the MUC1-C inhibitor resulted in loss of their capacity for colony formation in vitro with mean colonies of 4 and 40 for those cells exposed to the MUC1 inhibitor and a control peptide (n=2). In contrast, colony formation by normal hematopoietic stem cells was unaffected. Conclusions: MUC1 is selectively expressed by leukemic progenitors and may be used to differentiate malignant from normal hematopoietic stem cell populations. MUC1-C receptor subunit inhibition results in (i) downregulation of b-catenin signaling, (ii) induction of apoptosis and cell death, and (iii) disruption of the capacity to induce leukemia colony formation.
