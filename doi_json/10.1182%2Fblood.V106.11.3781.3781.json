    "abstract_text": "Background : Patients with sickle cell anemia have a higher potential for oxidative damage due to chronic redox imbalance in their red blood cells that often leads to hemolysis, endothelial injury and recurrent vaso-occlusive episodes. In this study, we evaluated plasma levels of the anti-oxidant vitamins A, C,& E and serum level of Zinc along with serum level of Copper (pro-oxidant ). Patients and methods: 25 adult patients with documented severe sickle cell anemia and frequent painful episodes (12 males & 13 females, aged 29.27 +/\u2212 12.94 years) and 25 matched normal controls were studied. Plasma levels of Vitamins A, C, & E were measured by HPLC technique and serum levels of zinc & copper were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: (Table ): Conclusion These results indicate that levels of Vitamines A, C, and E and Zinc are significantly low in patients with sickle cell anemia in comparison with matched normal controls. Besides, Copper level, which is a well known pro-oxidant, is significantly higher in sickle cell anemia patients. Therefore, supplementing sickle cell anemia patients with anti-oxidant vitamins and trace elements may contribute to the amilioration of symptoms and severity of sickle cell anemia Levels of Vitamine A, C, & E , Zinc & Copper in patients with Sickle cell anemia and normal controls  Tested Items .
