    "abstract_text": "Abstract 476 Background: The burden of VTE among nursing home (NH) residents is known to be high. Yet very little data exist to help determine which NH residents to target for VTE prophylaxis. The need to characterize VTE risk in this population is especially great because the advanced age and high comorbidity that typify NH residents contribute to increased likelihood of adverse consequences from VTE prophylaxis. To compound the problem, results of our prior univariate analyses of certain factors known to contribute substantially to VTE risk in the general population (e.g., major surgery, medical hospitalization, trauma) suggest that impact of these factors on VTE may be less substantial among NH residents. Objective: To use the longitudinal population-based resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) to investigate the contribution of multiple clinical characteristics to risk of VTE among NH residents. Methods: We took advantage of the previous identification of all Olmsted County, MN residents who met research criteria for incident VTE 1988 through 2005 (N=2,332). We then determined which individuals were resident of a local NH at time of VTE symptom onset, regardless of location of symptom onset (i.e., individuals whose VTE occurred in-hospital having been admitted from a NH were considered NH residents). For each such NH VTE case (N=269), we identified 2 same sex Olmsted County residents of similar age and duration of medical history who were also resident of a local NH at the time of the case's VTE event (i.e., index date) (N=538). We reviewed the detailed provider-linked medical records of NH VTE cases and NH non-VTE controls for 3 months before index for information on multiple characteristics identified or hypothesized as contributing to VTE risk in studies of the general population and other at-risk subgroups by our group and others (e.g., patient demographics, body mass index, major surgery, hospitalization for acute medical illness, outpatient surgical procedures, trauma/fracture, leg paresis, active cancer, superficial vein thrombosis, varicose veins, infections, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and multiple medications, including anticoagulants, statins, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists). We tested and estimated the odds ratio associated with each factor using step-wise conditional logistic regression. Variables for which <10 cases or <10 controls exhibited the characteristic were excluded from analysis. Results: The first five variables to enter the model were urinary tract infection, active cancer, superficial vein thrombosis, pneumonia, and leg paresis. The respective odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) with all five in the model were 1.7 (1.2, 2.4); 2.1 (1.3, 3.5); 2.1 (1.3, 3.4); 1.9 (1.3, 2.8); 2.3 (1.3, 4.2); each p value was <0.01. Variables associated with high VTE risk in the general population (i.e., surgery, hospitalization for medical illness, trauma/fracture) were not included in the top five risk factors for NH residents. Conclusions: Infection is a potent VTE risk factor among NH residents. Our study results will help inform development of practice guidelines in the NH and stimulate future research on putative VTE mechanisms. REP data afford limited information on cognitive and physical disability, immobility, and need for NH care. Additional investigations are needed that combine information from clinical and NH assessments. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
