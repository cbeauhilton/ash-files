    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4131 Background: Due to the widespread use of combined immunosuppressive therapy in the management of Crohn's disease (CD), the risk of malignant lymphoproliferation, including the fatal hepato-splenic T cell lymphoma (HSTCL), has become a major concern. We investigated dynamic changes of peripheral gamma-delta (\u03b3\u03b4)-T cells during CD treatment with the anti-TNF-\u03b1-antibodies infliximab (Remicade \u00ae ) and adalimumab (Humira \u00ae ). Methods: Forty-six patients with active CD and nine healthy volunteers were analysed. Patients delivered blood samples before and 1, 7, and 42 days after infliximab 5 mg/kg (20 patients) or adalimumab given as induction with 160 mg and 80 mg after 2 weeks and subsequently 40 mg every other week (26 patients). The \u03b3\u03b4-T cells were analysed using FACS analysis. Patients with high percentages of peripheral \u03b3\u03b4-T cells were characterized by PCR-assessment of \u03b3\u03b4-T cell clonality. Results: Of 46 patients included in the analysis, 35 (76%) had \u03b3\u03b4-T cell levels comparable to those of healthy individuals (mean: 1.6%; 95% CI: 1.3\u20132.0%). Higher \u03b3\u03b4-T cell levels from 5% up to 15% occurred in 11 patients (24% of the total cohort). A high \u03b3\u03b4-T cell level was associated with non-smoker status and young age. In 18 patients receiving thiopurines or methotrexate, the mean baseline \u03b3\u03b4-T cell percentage was 4.4% (95% CI: 2.1\u20136.7%). In three male CD patients with high baseline values, the \u03b3\u03b4-T cell percentage doubled within 24 hours following infliximab therapy. Another male patient on infliximab monotherapy presented with a predominantly clonal baseline \u03b3\u03b4-T cell population as high as 20%, further increasing to 25% shortly after infliximab treatment. Conclusion: One fourth of the CD patients treated with immunomodulators had constitutive high levels of circulating \u03b3\u03b4-T cells, and infliximab aggravates this \u03b3\u03b4-T cell expansion. We raise the hypothesis that such patients may be at increased risk of developing a malignant \u03b3\u03b4-T cell lymphoproliferation. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
