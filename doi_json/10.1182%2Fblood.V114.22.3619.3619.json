    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3619 Poster Board III-555 Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) controls neutrophil production in the bone marrow under steady state conditions and during demand-driven hematopoiesis occurring in response to infection. STAT3 is a principal signaling molecule activated by the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR). We previously reported that STAT3 has an important role in demand-driven granulopoiesis, although its cellular and molecular mechanisms have been unclear. To address this, we investigated STAT3 function in emergency granulopoiesis stimulated by G-CSF administration or infection with Listeria monocytogenes , which is restrained by the G-CSF response pathway in vivo . Our results show that STAT3-deficiency renders hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors refractory to the proliferation-inducing effects of G-CSF or Listeria monocytogenes infection. STAT3-deficient myeloid progenitors have a cell autonomous defect in G-CSF-responsive cell cycle progression and undergo delayed granulocyte maturation relative to wild type cells. To define STAT3 target pathways in granulocytic progenitors, we investigated the expression of CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) beta, a transcription factor that is necessary for G-CSF-driven emergency granulopoiesis. We found that STAT3 directly regulates G-CSF-responsive C/EBPbeta expression by binding to Cebpb promoter. Moreover, we show that STAT3 and C/EBPbeta co-regulate c-Myc during emergency granulopoiesis. These results place STAT3 as a crucial G-CSF-responsive signal transducer during demand-driven granulopoiesis, through its regulation of critical transcription factors in developing granulocytes.
