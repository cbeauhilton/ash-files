    "abstract_text": "Method: A query was generated to retrieve all cases treated with CPX-351 at Beaumont Health System. SPSS software was used to perform descriptive statistics. Results: We found 11 cases treated with CPX-351 from 2017 to 2019. Six patients were male and 5 females. The median age at diagnosis was 67. Eight patients were Caucasian, two African American and one Asian. The median body mass index (BMI) was 27.1 and median body surface area (BSA) was ! treated with CPX-351 after a diagnosis of AML-MRC and 4 patients (36.3%) with t-AML. The median hospital stay was 35 days. The median units of red blood cells transfusion during hospital stay were 9 units and the median number of transfused platelet units was 6. Only 2 patients (18.1%) achieved complete response (CR) and 2 patients (18.1%) achieved complete response with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi). Three patients developed allergic reactions presented as a rash, 2 patients had significant bleeding and all 11 patients developed neutropenic fever. Three patients died during induction therapy and 2 patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Six patients (54.5%) died within 90 days of starting induction therapy. Conclusion: t-AML and AML-MRC remain to have dismal prognosis. Our study highlights the high early mortality rate associated with induction therapy with CPX-351. The most common cause of death was refractory or relapsed leukemia. The high incidence of neutropenic fever was also more prevalent to what has been reported.
