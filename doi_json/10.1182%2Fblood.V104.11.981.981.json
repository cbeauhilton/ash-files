    "abstract_text": "HLA-mismatched unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation (uUCBT) is a suitable option for those who lack HLA-matched sibling donors. Although UCB T cells mount significantly less cytotoxicity and cytokine response than adult T cells uUCBT can lead to significant aGVHD. We hypothesized that select features of T cell and dendritic cell (DC) reconstitution will correlate with the development of aGVHD. Here we report on 106 prospectively studied pediatric patients, all full donor chimera. Methods: On day +50 we determined by 4-color surface and ic. FACS the reconstitution of T cell subsets, lymphoid, and myeloid DC, and measured their homeostatic proliferation, activation state, and inducible cytokine secretion to correlate with the risk for developing aGVHD. Logistic regression models were created on variables with a univariate P value 1Ag and select patterns of T cell subset and DC reconstitution may identify those at risk for GVHD.
