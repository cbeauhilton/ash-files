    "abstract_text": "Abstract 925 Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) consists of biologically distinct subtypes: Germinal Center B-cell (GCB)\u2013like and Activated B-cell (ABC)-like. Studies to date suggest that patients with tumors that have ABC features have an inferior survival; therefore, it is important to develop new therapies specifically for ABC-type DLBCL based on mechanistic differences. It has been shown that the ABC-DLBCL has high levels of total and phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) protein and this STAT3 activity may play a role in the survival of ABC-DLBCL cells. Indeed, when ABC and GCB cell were incubated with the novel JAK2 inhibitor TG101348 (TargeGen, San Diego, CA) we found potent cytotoxicity (LD50 2\u03bcM) in ABC DLBCL but not in GCB DLBCL. This provides further rationale to study the regulation of STAT3 in the survival of ABC type DLBCL cells. In studies of HDAC expression in ABC DLBCL cells, we found over-expression of the class 1 histone deacetylases, specifically HDAC1 and HDAC3. We then performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to learn the functional interaction between STAT3 and HDACs. We found that STAT3 formed complexes with HDAC1 to a greater extent than HDAC3. We also showed that STAT3 did co-precipitate with HDAC1 suggesting a reciprocal relationship between these two proteins. These results suggested that HDAC1 (but not HDAC3) might be involved in the regulation of STAT3. The HDAC inhibitor LBH589 (LBH, Novartis Pharm) was more cytotoxic to ABC (LD50, 10-20nM) than GCB (LD50, 50-100nM) and was shown to dephosphorylate STAT3. These results led to experiments designed to determine the effect of LBH on STAT3 acetylation. When ABC cells were incubated with LBH, co-immunoprecipitation data showed a dose-dependent increased in acetylation of STAT3 without significant change on the levels of STAT3 immunoprecipitated. Next, we asked that how LBH is dephosphorylating STAT3. One potential mechanism is activation of a protein phosphatase. Immunoprecipitation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in the lysates of LBH-treated cells followed by western blotting of STAT3 demonstrated a positive correlation between LBH dose and amount of STAT3 co-immunoprecipitated with PP2A. Our data show that when LBH is incubated with ABC cells, the LBH increases binding of PP2A to STAT3 and the increased phosphatase activity turns off STAT3 signaling. Since both HDAC inhibitor (LBH) and the JAK2 inhibitor (TG) had selective cytotoxic effects on ABC cells, and since both agents dephosphorylate STAT3, we combined the two drugs. We found that the combination exhibited enhanced inhibitory effects on the growth of ABC cells and was able to alter the association of STAT3 with HDAC1 and subsequently dephosphorylate STAT3 to greater extent than either agent alone. Furthermore, we knocked down HDAC1 expression (through siRNA) in OCILy10 (ABC) cells and showed that inhibition of HDAC1 inhibits constitutively activated STAT3. This data suggests that inhibiting HDAC1 expression results in STAT3 dephosphorylation. In summary, we have demonstrated that a key consequence of HDAC expression in ABC cells is continuous activation of STAT3. These data indicate that HDACs activate STAT3 and that PP2A may be important in maintaining STAT3 in the activated state in the ABC cells. This study describes a new mechanism by which STAT3 mediates ABC cell survival and provides the rationale for targeting ABC type DLBCL by simultaneously inhibiting HDAC activity and STAT3 activation by pharmacologic grade inhibitors such as LBH589 and TG101348, which are currently in clinical trial. A phase 1 and 2 trial of JAK2 inhibitor, TG101348 for ABC/GCB type DLBCL is planned. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
