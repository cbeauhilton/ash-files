    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic Stem cell Transplantation (HSCT) is the definitive treatment for bone marrow failure in diskeratosis congenita (DC). Organ dysfunction (mainly lung and gastrointestinal tract) are often part of the disease and may be a limiting factor for or may affect the final outcome of HSCT. Scarce data or relatively small cohort studies are available in current literature on outcome of HSCT in this disease. We analyzed the outcome of 87 patients diagnosed with DC reported in the data base of the European Society for Blood an Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) who underwent HSCT from 1979 to 2014. In particular we analyzed data on type of HSCT, characteristic of donors, source of cells, incidence of acute and chronic GvHD. Males were 76%. Median age at diagnosis of DC was 5.7 years (0-33 yrs), median age at HSCT was 11.2 years (range 0.56-41 yrs). Median time from diagnosis to HSCT was 19 months (0.62-304 mo). The cell source was bone marrow (BM) in 67%, peripheral blood (PB) in 22% and cord blood (CB) 11%. Twenty six percent of patients were engrafted from a matched related and 53% from a matched unrelated donor. Twenty one percent of subjects were engrafted from a mismatched (both related and unrelated) HSCT. Engraftment was documented in 95% of subjects: 4 % had primary graft failure and 10% lost the graft. Overall 35 patients (40%) died, and 52 were alive (60%) at last follow-up. Causes of death were: infections (43%), multi-organ failure (26%), rejection/oss of graft (14%), GvDH (8.5%) undefined (8.5%). In 32% of cases death was related to transplant. Lung injury was present in 17% of subjects who died. Acute GVDH (mainly grade 2-4) and chronic GvHD occurred in 39% and 30% of cases. Five year OS was 60 %. OS was not significantly different by calendar period (before and after year 2000: 50% vs 67% respectively, p=0.424), by age at transplant (below and above age of 12 years: 64% vs 55% respectively ; p= 0.564) and by source of cells (marrow 60%, cord blood 68%, and peripheral cells 46%; p= 0.687). Conversely, OS in HSCT from mismatched donor was inferior to that of transplants from matched donor (38% vs 65% respectively; p= 0.045). The use of radiotherapy or busulfan (any dose) in the conditioning vs other regimens did not impact on 5 y-OS ( 58% vs 62% respectively; p=0.898). HSCT from HLA matched donor can be considered a treatment option in DC. Transplant related mortality looks rater high. Multi organ failure and lung injury are amongst the main causes of death thus pointing to pre-transplant organ status as important determinant of HSCT outcome.
