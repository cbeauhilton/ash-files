    "abstract_text": "Fetomaternal and transmaternal sibling microchimerism might result in tolerance of hematopoietic stem-cell donors to recipients who were born before them. A single clinical study comparing first-born recipients and first-born donors provided evidence that birth order can have a significant impact on survival and on the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and relapse in HLA-identical sibling transplantation. In order to determine whether birth order might exert a consistent, biologically important effect, we compared survival and the incidence of acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, and relapse in recipients of HLA-identical transplants from sibling donors older than themselves to recipients with younger sibling donors. From 11/84 through 11/06, 410 first HLA-identical sibling transplants were performed. Patients were categorized by whether the sibling donor was older (n=187) or younger (n=223) than the recipient. As expected, the two groups differed with respect to patient age (P<0.001). The groups were similar with respect to gender, diagnosis, interval from diagnosis to transplant, extent of prior treatment, preparative regimen, stem-cell source, donor to patient gender, and CD34+ cell dose. Outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier Method and compared between the birth order groups using the log rank test. The incidence of acute GVHD, \u2265 grade II acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, extensive chronic GVHD, relapse, survival, and disease-free survival were similar (0.39\u2264P\u22640.85) between the two groups. The incidence of acute GVHD and survival in the two groups is shown below: View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure Close modal View large Download slide Figure View large Download slide Figure Close modal After adjustment for differences between the two groups, multivariable assessment of sibling birth order was not prognostic for survival (P=.32). Only older (P=0.029) and male donor/female recipient (P=.017) were independent prognostic adverse factors. In this large study of the HLA-identical sibling transplantation, no impact of birth order on the incidence of GVHD, relapse incidence, or survival was detected. Although (because of different methodologies) not directly contradictory to a previous study of birth order, the present results suggest that further study of the impact of birth order on outcome of HLA-identical sibling transplantation is needed. Suggestions that birth order be integrated into donor-selection algorithms or that matched unrelated donors might be preferred to high-risk HLA identical siblings are premature.",
