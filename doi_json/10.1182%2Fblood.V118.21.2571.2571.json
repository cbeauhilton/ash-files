    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2571 Background: In our previous EORTC 58881 trial in childhood ALL, we have shown the prognostic impact of the MRD, quantitated by polymerase chain reaction assay. Patients with TP1 MRD \u226510\u20132 (D35), had a higher risk of relapse than those with TP1 MRD<10-2 (Cave\u0301 et al, NEJM, 1998). For these patients hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with an HLA matched donor was recommended in our subsequent EORTC 58951 trial. Here we report on the patients with MRD \u226510-2 (TP1) in the 58951 trial. Methods: Between December 1998 and July 2008, 1955 children (1y-18y) with ALL were enrolled in the 58951 trial, 1459 being evaluable for the MRD (TP1) by PCR (rearrangements of the T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes). Seventy-nine patients with Phi-negative ALL had a TP1 MRD \u226510-2, and 69 of them achieved a complete hematological remission after induction. Here we report on the outcome of these 69 patients. Results: At a median follow-up of 7.6 years, the overall 5-years EFS and OS rates for the 69 patients were 56.1% (SE 6.0%) and 62.0% (SE 5.9%) respectively. Prephase good responders (PGR) ( 51 chromosomes were PGR. TP2 MRD (after consolidation) was assessed in 59 pts. All patients but one (1/13) with TP2 MRD \u226510-2 died. In PGR patients, those with TP2 MRD < 10-3 (N=18) had a significant better OS rate at 5 years than those with TP2 MRD \u226510-3 (N=17): 88.9% (SE 7.4%) vs 52.3 % (SE 12.3%), hazard ratio=0.17, p=0.009. We observed no relapses among patients with hyperdiploidy > 51 chromosomes and TP2 <10-3. PPR patients had a poor 5-year OS, independent of TP2 level (MRD <10-3 (N=8) or MRD \u226510-3 (N=16)). Conclusions: The prognosis of children ALL with TP1 MRD \u226510-2 has improved with early intensification of the treatment as compared to the one observed in our previous 58881 study. However the outcome of these patients was still heterogeneous and the prephase response was still of prognostic importance. Patients with GPR and TP2 <10-3 had a favourable prognosis and for those patients HSCT is not mandatory. For other patients with PPR and/or TP2 \u226510-3 the prognosis was worse and these patients may benefit from alternative therapy and/or intensification with HSCT.
