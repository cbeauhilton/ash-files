    "abstract_text": "25 mg of iron are required every day to sustain hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. Most iron is consumed by erythroid cells that take up transferrin-bound iron to satisfy their demand for hemoglobin biogenesis. Unexpectedly, erythroblasts express high levels of the iron exporter Ferroportin (Fpn). Fpn surface expression and activity is controlled by Hepcidin, a small liver peptide hormone, produced in response to elevated systemic and tissue iron availability. Resistance of ferroportin to hepcidin binding is caused by a gain of function mutation in the FpnC326S residue, which is the reason for iron overload in patients with Hereditary Hemochromatosis type 4. Some years ago we generated the corresponding mouse model hallmarked by this constitutively active iron exporter. We now applied bone marrow transplantation to investigate the role of the hepcidin/ferroportin regulatory system in cell types of the bone marrow (BM-FpnC326S). CD45.1 host mice were irradiated twice with 500 cGy 4h apart and injected with 2 million of BM cells obtained from C57BL/6N mice (control) or from C57BL/6N congenic constitutive FpnC326S animals. Mice were analyzed three months after transplantation, whereby only animals with an engraftment higher than 95% were included for further analyses. Analysis of the erythroid hematological parameters revealed mild macrocytosis in the presence of unaltered red blood cell count (RBC), hematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin (Hb) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) values. Serum iron content, transferrin saturation and serum hepcidin levels remained unchanged, despite a strong decrease in splenic iron levels within the red pulp, where reticuloendothelial macrophages are located. The latter phenotype is consistent with high ferroportin surface expression in macrophages derived from FpnC326S monocytes that causes increased iron export and cellular iron deficiency. Cytokine production (IL1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1 and IL6) in the spleen was unchanged suggesting that iron deficiency in splenic macrophages did not cause inflammation. In contrast to the spleen iron content was not changed in other organs analyzed, including the liver, suggesting that de novo monocyte infiltration is not a major feature in these organs. Interestingly, histological analysis of the femurs revealed a marked decrease in bone marrow iron content; we were unable to detect a single iron-stained cell in the bone marrow of BM-FpnC326S mice, contrasting results from control mice. To investigate whether iron deficiency in bone marrow cells alters numbers of immune cells, we performed a detailed characterization by FACS. Unexpectedly, iron deficiency in the bone marrow did not cause changes in total bone marrow cellularity, total numbers of Ter119+ erythroid cells and the percentage of different erythroblast subpopulations, the number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and of common lymphoid (CLP), myeloid (CMP) and megakaryocyte/erythroid (MEP) progenitors. Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that at steady state, the hepcidin/ferroportin regulatory circuitry in the bone marrow is dispensable and that iron deficiency in bone marrow cells is not altering the normal hematopoietic process. Future studies will have to extend the analysis to stress conditions. Disclosures Muckenthaler: Novartis: Research Funding; Silence Therapeutics: Consultancy."
