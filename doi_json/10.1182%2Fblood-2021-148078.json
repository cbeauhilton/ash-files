    "abstract_text": "Background: Axi-cel, an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, is approved for the treatment of pts with relapsed/refractory LBCL with \u2265 2 prior systemic therapies. In the 2-year analysis of ZUMA-1 (NCT02348216), the multicenter, single-arm phase 1/2 study evaluating axi-cel in pts with refractory LBCL, the objective response rate (ORR) was 83%, including a complete response (CR) rate of 58%; 39% of pts had ongoing response with a median follow-up of 27.1 months (Locke et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019). EFS is emerging as a robust surrogate endpoint for OS in hematologic malignancies. A recent systematic analysis demonstrated a linear correlation between EFS and OS in pts with diffuse LBCL after first-line immunochemotherapy (Zhu et al. Leukemia . 2020). Here, we report updated survival findings from the phase 2 portion of ZUMA-1 after 4 years of follow-up, including an evaluation of the association of OS with EFS. Methods: Eligible pts had refractory LBCL (diffuse LBCL, primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma). After leukapheresis at enrollment, pts received low-dose conditioning chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) followed by a target dose of 2\u00d710 6 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg (Neelapu et al. N Engl J Med . 2017). The primary endpoint was ORR, with the first response assessment occurring 4 weeks following infusion. Additional endpoints included safety and translational evaluations. An exploratory analysis of OS by EFS at 12 and 24 months was performed. EFS was defined as the time from axi-cel infusion until disease progression, initiation of new lymphoma therapy (excluding stem cell transplant), or death from any cause. Comparisons of OS by EFS outcomes were analyzed via Kaplan-Meier estimates. Results: Of 111 enrolled pts, axi-cel was administered to 101 pts. As of August 11, 2020, median follow-up was 51.1 months. With over 4 years of follow-up, median OS was 25.8 months, and the 4-year OS rate was 44%. Median EFS in pts treated with axi-cel was 5.7 months, with a 12-month EFS rate of 43% (95% CI, 33-52) and a 24-month EFS rate of 38% (95% CI, 28-47). In pts with an EFS event by Month 12 (EFS12; n=57) vs those without EFS12 (n=44), 4-year OS rates were 7% (95% CI, 2-16) vs 91% (95% CI, 78-97), respectively. Among the 17 pts with EFS12 who were alive at Month 12, 13 (76%) died by Month 48, while among the 44 pts alive at Month 12 without EFS12, 4 (9%) died by Month 48. In pts with an EFS event by Month 24 (EFS24; n=62) vs those without EFS24 (n=39), 4-year OS rates were 13% (95% CI, 6-23) vs 92% (95% CI, 78-98), respectively. Among the 12 pts with EFS24 who were alive at Month 24, 4 (33%) died by Month 48, while among the 39 pts alive at Month 24 without EFS24, 3 (8%) died by Month 48. Since the 2-year analysis (Locke et al. Lancet Oncol . 2019), there have been no new safety signals reported, including no new serious adverse events, no axi-cel-related secondary malignancy, and no confirmed cases of replication-competent retrovirus. Overall, 26 pts received subsequent anti-cancer therapy; median time to next therapy was 8.7 months (range, 0.3 - 53.8). Immunoglobulin therapy was administered to 38 (38%) pts. Two pts in axi-cel-induced remission received allogeneic stem cell transplant; 1 pt was in CR and 1 pt was in partial response. Among treated pts, 58 (57%) have died, primarily due to progressive disease (46%; n=46), followed by other reasons (7%; n=7), adverse events (4%; n=4), and secondary malignancy (myelodysplastic syndrome, with onset on Day 574) unrelated to axi-cel (1%; n=1). Among pts without EFS12 and without EFS24, 1 pt each (2% and 3%, respectively) died due to disease progression >24 months following axi-cel infusion; >36 months, 2 pts each (5% for both) died due to disease progression (1 pt each [2% and 3%]) and other reasons (1 pt each [2% and 3%]. One pt (2%) without EFS12 died due to disease progression between 12 and 24 months. Updated findings with \u22655 years of follow-up, including translational correlations, will be presented. Conclusion: In this long-term survival analysis of ZUMA-1 with \u22654 years of follow-up, axi-cel demonstrated longer OS in pts without EFS events at Month 12 and Month 24 vs pts with events at these timepoints. These data support the use of EFS as a surrogate endpoint for long-term OS in refractory LBCL, and the relationship between EFS and 5-year OS will be presented.
