    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most prevalent hematologic malignancy. Approximately, 80,000 people have died of the disease in the United States and 25,000 new cases are registered every year. Majority of patients develop resistance to current therapeutic treatments and die within 5-10 years of diagnosis. Thus, need of novel therapeutic intervention is extremely urgent. Although the field of oncolytic virotherapy (OV) based on using viruses with natural or engineered tumor selective replication to intentionally infect and kill tumor cells has been extensively explored for the treatment of solid tumors, only few data are available for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies. Our laboratory was one of the first to show that OV using Reovirus can be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of MM in vitro and in MM patients. In this work we aim at exploring the possibility of using genetically engineered HSV1 ( H erpes S implex V irus) for the treatment of MM. HSV1 is an enveloped, double stranded DNA virus. Engineered HSV1 (HSVQ) has both copies of viral gene important in viral replication in normal cells viz., ICP 34.5 gene deleted and has one copy of GFP inserted into viral ICP6 gene. Such engineered virus has been used for cancer cell selective killing in preclinical and clinical studies for the treatment of several types of solid tumors including melanoma and glioblastoma multiforme. In this study, we investigated the biological and preclinical impact of HSVQ on MM cell in vitro and in vivo . Method: Recombinant HSVQ was amplified in African green monkey kidney epithelial Vero cells, purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and titrated by plaque assay on Vero cells. Several MM cell lines (MM1.S, U266, RPMI8226, L363, NIH-H929) were infected with HSVQ at Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) 0.01 to 5. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis were used to assess MM cell infectivity with the virus. RT-PCR was performed to detect presence of viral genome in MM cell lines. Viral replication assays were also performed. Cell proliferation and apoptotic assays including MTT Assay, Tryphan Blue exclusion test, LIVE/DEAD cell viability staining and Annexin/7-AAD assays were done to determine viability of virus infected MM cells. Western Blot analysis was carried out to determine endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response mediated by ERK, Hsp90, Bip/GRP78, Hsp40 and apoptosis in HSVQ treated MM cells. Total bone marrow (BM) cells obtained from MM patients were infected with HSVQ and multi parametric flow analysis was performed to determine infectivity and specific killing of CD138+ MM cells by the virus. To study in vivo anti-tumorigenic properties of HSVQ, 12.5 x10 6 GFP/Luc + MM1.S or NIH-H929 cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of 20 NOD-SCID mice. Two weeks after injection, mice with comparable size tumors were randomly divided (5 animal for each treatment group) and treated twice with 1x10 7 PFU (Plaque Forming Unit) HSVQ for 2 weeks or with saline. Tumor growth was measured to determine anti tumorigenic effect of HSVQ on MM tumors. Results and Conclusion: Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry revealed that MM cell lines can be effectively infected with and killed by HSVQ even at MOI as low as 0.1. Under such conditions, Western Blot analysis revealed increased BAX expression, decreased BCL2 expression and cleavage of Caspase 3 and PARP indicating apoptosis of virus infected cells. Interestingly, multi parametric flow analysis revealed that HSVQ specifically infects and kills CD138+ MM plasma cells in a total population of BM cellular fraction isolated from MM patients. Moreover in vivo preclinical data show that HSVQ dramatically reduces tumor volume (p<0.001) in both MM.1S and NIH-H929 xenograft mouse models. Thus, from the preliminary observations, it can be concluded that HSVQ can selectively infect and induce apoptosis in myeloma cells. Mechanisms of HSVQ replication in MM cells and induced MM cell killing are being currently investigated. Here for the first time we are providing clear evidences that HSVQ can infect and specifically kill MM cells supporting the idea of the use of HSV for the treatment of MM. Moreover, since the backbone of HSVQ can be further engineered, it can be used to specifically deliver anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory genes to MM cells for the treatment of MM.
