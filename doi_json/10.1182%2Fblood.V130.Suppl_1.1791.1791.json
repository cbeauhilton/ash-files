    "abstract_text": "The use of genetically engineered T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) against CD19 or BCMA to treat hematologic malignancies has demonstrated promising results in clinical trials. However, it is possible that the efficacy of CAR T cells could be limited in some clinical indications due to suppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment. Immunosuppressive cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-10 and TGF\u03b2) provide a favorable environment for tumor growth and inhibit the tumoricidal activity of the endogenous T cells. In particular, transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) has been shown to suppress T-cell proliferation, inhibit the maturation of T helper cells and reduce their effector functions. Elevated levels of TGF\u03b2 have been detected in many human cancers, including multiple myeloma (MM). Here, we sought to modulate the activity of CAR T cell-based immunotherapy for MM by inhibiting TGF\u03b2 signaling in BCMA-specific CAR T cells (Budha et al., Cancer Cell , 2012). We evaluated two strategies to modulate the TGF\u03b2 pathway: (1) knocking out TGF\u03b2 Receptor II (TGF\u03b2RII) using CRISPR gene editing and (2) overexpressing a dominant negative TGF\u03b2RII in BCMA targeted CAR T cells. TGF\u03b2RII modulation inhibited TGF\u03b2-dependent Smad2/3 phosphorylation. TGF\u03b2RII-modulated BCMA CAR T cells were insensitive to TGF\u03b2-mediated inhibition of proliferation, cell cytotoxicity and cytokine production, both IFNg and granzyme B, in the context of primary and/or repeat antigen stimulation with BCMA +ve MM cell lines in vitro . We further evaluated the gene expression signatures of BCMA CAR T cells isolated from tumor and spleen in a NSG mouse xenograft model subcutaneously inoculated with myeloma cell line (RPMI8226). TGF\u03b2 pathway gene expression changes indicating TGF\u03b2 exposure were observed in BCMA CAR T cells isolated from tumor, but not spleen, suggesting that BCMA CAR T cells are encountering a TGF\u03b2-enriched TME. However, both TGF\u03b2 pathway modulating strategies prevented the development of the TGF\u03b2-induced gene expression phenotype. Together, these data suggest that inhibition of TGF\u03b2RII signaling may potentiate CAR T activity by directly inhibiting immunosuppressive effects of TGF\u03b2 in the tumor microenvironment. By specifically targeting TGF\u03b2 signaling in CAR T cells, it may be possible to avoid side effects associated with systemic administration of TGF\u03b2 antagonists. Gene editing to remove TGF\u03b2RII expression or overexpressing dominant negative TGF\u03b2 RII could modulate the activity of BCMA CAR T therapy in MM.
