    "abstract_text": "Introduction Microparticles are submicron vesicles released by activated or apoptotic cells. Previous studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated elevated levels of endothelial cell (EC)-derived microparticles in the plasma of patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA), which are associated with thrombosis and recurrent fetal loss. The majority of pathologic APLA are directed against \u03b2 2 -glycoprotein I (\u03b2 2 GPI), an abundant plasma phospholipid binding protein. APLA/anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies activate endothelial cells in a \u03b2 2 GPI-dependent manner and stimulate the release of EC microparticles. Here, we demonstrate that these microparticles are enriched in active interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and may directly stimulate EC activation. Methods EC were treated with \u03b2 2 GPI and anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies and microparticles were isolated by ultra-centrifugation. The treated EC, released microparticles and microparticle-free supernatant were analyzed for interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) expression by western blot. In addition, we assessed the ability of microparticles derived from EC exposed to control IgG or anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies, or microparticle-free supernatant that had been adsorbed with immobilized \u03b2 2 GPI to remove residual anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies, to activate EC. Activation was defined by increased expression of cell surface E-selectin and phosphorylation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4). Results Incubation of EC with \u03b2 2 GPI and anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies stimulated the expression of pro-IL-1\u03b2. Interestingly, while EC contained exclusively pro-IL-1\u03b2, microparticles derived from these treated cells contained only the active, cleaved form of IL-1\u03b2. Moreover, extracellular IL-1\u03b2 was found exclusively in microparticles, and was absent from microparticle-free conditioned medium Finally, IL-1\u03b2-containing microparticles derived from anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibody-treated EC, but not microparticles released from EC exposed to only control IgG activated additional EC. Conditioned medium from anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibody-treated EC that had been pre-adsorbed with immobilized \u03b2 2 GPI to remove residual anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies also failed to stimulate EC activation. Conclusions EC exposed to \u03b2 2 GPI and anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies stimulate the expression pro-IL-1\u03b2, which undergoes cleavage to an active form and is packaged in microparticles. These microparticles may directly induce activation of EC or synergize with anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies to activate EC. We hypothesize that delivery of IL-1\u03b2 and perhaps other inflammatory cytokines by microparticles derived from anti-\u03b2 2 GPI-exposed EC or monocytes may induce a systemic vascular inflammatory state in which anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies may more readily stimulate thrombotic events.
