    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hemoglobinopathy characterized by vaso-occlusion and hemolysis. Even at disease baseline, von Willebrand factor (VWF) quantity and activity is markedly increased and correlates with the extent of hemolysis [Chen et al. Blood , 2011, 117:3680]. VWF is an adhesive plasma protein capable of binding platelets, and secondarily, erythrocytes, and leukocytes. Its adhesive activity is regulated at several levels: being decreased by proteolysis by the metalloprotease ADAMTS13 [Dong et al. Blood , 2002, 100:4033] or by inhibition of self-association into more adhesive forms by high density lipoprotein (HDL) [Chung et al. Blood , 2016, 127:637], or enhanced by oxidative modification [Chen et al. Blood , 2010, 115:706; Fu et al. Blood , 2011, 118:5283]. Here, we explored several potential mechanisms accounting for the increased total active VWF in SCD patients: endothelial activation, enhanced VWF self-association, and defective cleavage of endogenous VWF because of ADAMTS13 dysfunction and/or VWF resistance to cleavage due to oxidation. Methods: We analyzed plasma collected from 12 adult SCD patients at disease baseline; for 3 of these we also have samples collected during vaso-occlusive crisis. We also analyzed multiple crisis samples from one additional patient with no baseline sample. To determine if SCD plasma could activate endothelial cells, we incubated plasma with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured in parallel-plate flow chambers for 20 min at 37\u02daC then washed the plasma away before perfusing fixed platelets through the chamber. The number and length of platelet-decorated VWF strings were then quantified as a measure of endothelial activation. The plasma levels of VWF, apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I, the major apolipoprotein in HDL), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and ADAMTS13 were measured by sandwich ELISA. The activity of ADAMTS13 was evaluated by 1) cleavage of a small VWF A2 peptide substrate; 2) cleavage of multimeric VWF in patient plasma in 1.5 M urea and examining the VWF multimer pattern over time; 3) cleavage of preformed VWF-platelet strings on activated HUVECs; and 4) examining the extent of VWF cleavage in vivo using mass spectrometry (MS). The oxidation of specific methionine residues in VWF and ADAMTS13 from patient plasma was measured by MS as described previously [Chen et al. Blood , 2010, 115:706; Wang et al. JBC , 2015, 290:1422]. Results: 1) HUVECs incubated with SCD plasma were activated and produced 2 to 25 fold more VWF strings than cells treated with pooled normal plasma (PNP). Activation was inhibited if the plasma was pre-incubated with hemopexin (0.5 mg/ml), implicating heme as an activator. However, purified heme alone even at high concentration did not activate HUVECs to secrete VWF strings, indicating that heme is required but not sufficient. 2) The ratio of VWF to ApoA-I was markedly elevated in SCD patients, especially during crisis (2.3 \u00b1 0.7 fold of PNP), indicating predisposition to VWF self-association. 3) ADAMTS13 from SCD plasma was defective in cleaving VWF strings (11% to 57% of PNP) and multimeric VWF, but not the A2 peptide substrate. 4) Almost all of the SCD plasma had elevated MPO (3.8 \u00b1 2.5 and 12.8 \u00b1 7.6 fold of PNP in baseline and crisis samples, respectively). 5) Our previous studies showed that HOCl oxidation of VWF Met1606 at the ADAMTS13 cleavage site rendered the VWF noncleavable, and oxidation at other sites increased its platelet-binding activity. We also found that HOCl can inactivate ADAMTS13 by oxidizing Met249 within the metalloprotease domain. We therefore evaluated the extent of VWF Met1606 and ADAMTS13 Met249 oxidation, and VWF cleavage by ADAMTS13 in vivo in patient plasma using tandem MS. We found that ADAMTS13 in SCD plasma had elevated oxidation at Met249 (1.6 \u00b1 0.2 fold of normal controls); VWF cleavage by ADAMTS13 in vivo was decreased by as much as 40% in several of these patients, and the extent of cleavage correlated negatively with the extent of VWF Met1606 oxidation. Summary: Multiple mechanisms contribute to enhanced VWF activity in SCD patients. These include increased secretion by activated endothelial cells, enhanced VWF self-association, and defective cleavage of VWF by endogenous ADAMTS13, partially due to oxidative modification of both VWF and ADAMTS13.
