    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Multiple myeloma (MM) disease progression is dependent on the ability of the MM plasma cells (PC) to leave the bone marrow (BM), re-enter the peripheral blood (PB) and disseminate to other BM sites. Previous studies show that expression of CXCL12 by BM stromal cells is crucial for MM PC retention within the BM. However, the mechanisms which overcome this retention signal enabling MM PC egress and dissemination via the PB are poorly understood. Previous studies in haematopoietic progenitor cells have demonstrated that CCL3 overcomes the CXCL12 retention signal to drive mobilisation to the PB (Lord et al. Blood 1995). Here, we examined the role of the CCL3 chemokine receptor CCR1 in driving MM PC dissemination. Methods and results: Initially, we assessed the expression of CCR1 protein on CD138 + CD38 ++ CD45 lo CD19 - PC from 28 MM, 8 MGUS and 2 SMM patients by flow cytometry. Results show CCR1 expression is significantly increased in newly diagnosed MM compared with premalignant MGUS and SMM patients (p=0.03; CCR1 MFI mean\u00b1SEM, MGUS: 53.0\u00b133.6; SMM: 37.6\u00b18.9 MM: 250.9\u00b171.6). Furthermore, CCR1 expression on PB MM PC positively correlated with PB MM PC numbers (p=0.03; n=11 patients). To identify mechanistically how CCR1 may promote dissemination, the effect of CCL3 on the response to CXCL12 in human myeloma cell lines (HMCL) was assessed in vitro . The migration of RPMI-8226 and OPM2 cells was induced by CCL3 or CXCL12 chemoattractant in a transwell assay. Notably, pre-treatment of RPMI-8226 or OPM2 with CCL3 abrogated migration towards CXCL12 and blocked F-actin remodelling in response to CXCL12 in vitro . These findings suggest that CCL3 can desensitise cells to exogenous CXCL12, providing a potential mechanism facilitating loss of the CXCL12 retention signal. To confirm whether CCR1 is required for driving MM PC dissemination, homozygous CCR1 knockout (KO) cells were generated using a lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 system in OPM2 cells. CCR1-KO OPM2 cells were confirmed to have no detectable CCR1 expression by flow cytometry and could no longer migrate towards CCL3 in vitro. Empty vector (EV) or CCR1-KO OPM2 MM PC were injected into the tibia of immune-compromised NOD- scid gamma (NSG) mice. After 4 weeks, primary tumour within the injected tibia and disseminated tumour in the PB and the contralateral tibia and femur was assessed by flow cytometry. We found that mice bearing CCR1-KO cells have a 45.5% decrease in primary tumour growth (p=0.008; % GFP+ of total mononuclear cells, EV: 77.2\u00b117.2; CCR1-KO: 42.1\u00b124.4), a 97.8% reduction in PB MM PC (p<0.0001; EV: 1.39\u00b10.7; CCR1-KO: 0.03\u00b10.046) anda 99.9% reduction in BM tumour dissemination (p<0.0001; EV: 49.5\u00b117; CCR1-KO: 0.019\u00b10.013), compared with controls. In a supportive study, CCR1 was expressed in the murine MM cell line 5TGM1 using lentiviral transduction. 5TGM1-CCR1 cells were confirmed to express CCR1 by qPCR and were able to migrate towards CCL3 in vitro . 5TGM1-CCR1 or EV cells were injected into the tibiae of C57BL/KaLwRij mice and allowed to initiate systemic MM disease for 3.5 weeks. Importantly, while 55% of control mice exhibited disseminated tumours, this increased to 92% with CCR1 expression (p<0.0001; n=12/group). These data suggest that CCR1 expression on MM PC may play an important role in MM PC dissemination. To determine whether therapeutic inhibition of CCR1 prevents dissemination, the effect of a small molecule CCR1 inhibitor, CCR1 i , was assessed in vivo . OPM2 EV or RPMI-8226 cells were injected into the tibia of NSG mice and, after 3 days, mice were treated with CCR1 i (15mg/kg) or vehicle twice daily by oral gavage for 25 days. OPM2-inoculated CCR1 i -treated mice had 66.1% lower PB MM PC (p<0.0001; % GFP+ of total mononuclear cells, vehicle: 23.9\u00b17.2; CCR1 i : 8.1\u00b13.8) and a 22.1% reduction in BM dissemination (p=0.0002; vehicle: 78.1\u00b14.8;CCR1 i : 60.8\u00b17.1) compared with controls. Similarly, CCR1 i treatment reduced BM dissemination by 59.6% in RPMI-8226 bearing mice (p<0.0001; % GFP+ of total mononuclear cells, vehicle: 0.86\u00b10.15; CCR1 i : 0.26\u00b10.05). This suggests that CCR1 inhibition can slow tumour dissemination in vivo . Conclusion: This study identified CCR1 as a novel driver of MM PC dissemination in vivo , at least in part by overcoming the CXCL12 retention signal. Importantly, this study demonstrated for the first time that targeting CCR1 can be a viable therapeutic strategy to limit dissemination and potentially slow disease progression.
