    "abstract_text": "Background: The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) is higher than in the general pediatric population. Adenotonsillectomy involves significantly increased risks in patients with SCD because of the need for general anesthesia,which could induce a vaso-occlusive event. Various preoperative regimens have been suggested to reduce peri-operative risks for SCD patients. Objective: We retrospectively reviewed the perioperative management for pediatric SCD patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy. We sought to identify the optimal preoperative hemoglobin (Hb) level for patients to have lowest risk of post-operative complications. Methods: Children between 1 and 18 years old with SCD including HbSS, HbSC, HbS beta thalassemia (S\u03b2 0 and S\u03b2 + ) who underwent adenotonsillectomy from 2007 to 2017 were identified at Holtz Children's Hospital. Patients without these diseases who underwent the procedures were collected as a control. The study was approved by the University of Miami Institutional Review Board (IRB). De-identified data were exported to GraphPad Prism version 5.02 to perform the statistical analyses. Means were analyzed by student t test, rates by Chi-squared test. p < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. Results: Thirty-four patients with SCD (mean 7.1 yrs) and 145 controls (mean 7.0 yrs) were identified with adenotonsillectomy (see Table 1). SCD patients had significant longer hospital stay (2.6 versus 0.9 days, p< 0.001), and higher postoperative complication rates than the control group (20.6% vs 4.0%, p= 0.02). Most of the sickle cell patients' complications were hypoxemia (5 out of 7), except one supraventricular tachycardia and one headache. Four out of 7 patients with pretransfusion (pretrx) Hb level above 10 g/dL received manual exchange transfusion to keep Hb over 10 g/dL. None had complication or PICU stay. When patients' pretrx Hb levels was 9-10 g/dL, 5/8 received transfusion without significant complications, with the goal of not increasing post transfusion Hb over 11.5 g/dL. Most patients with pretrx Hb level 7-9 g/dL received simple blood transfusion. For patients with preoperative Hb level 9-11.5 g/dL, the PICU transfer rate was significantly lower than ones with Hb = 11.5 g/dL (11.5% vs 60%, p=0.04; see Figure 1). Complication rates were also lower in the Hb 9-11.5 g/dL group, but without statistical difference (19.2% vs 40%, p=0.3). Data is limited by small sample size in the SCD group. Conclusion(s): We concluded that for pediatric SCD patients planning for adenotonsillectomy, it is better to keep the posttransfusion Hb level at least above 9 mg/dL but less than 11.5 g/dL before procedure to avoid significant post operational complications. If pretransfusion Hb level is above 9 mg/dL, exchange transfusion by partial phlebotomy or simple transfusion (not to exceed 11.5 g/dL) may be considered.
