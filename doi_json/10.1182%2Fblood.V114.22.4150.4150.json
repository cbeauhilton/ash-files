    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4150 The immunotoxin gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg\u2018, GO) comprises a potent cytotoxic agent, calicheamicin, and a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD33. GO is increasingly used for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as CD33, a trans-membranous glycoprotein, is highly expressed on most leukemic blast cells, but, in normal cells confined to early multilineage hematopoietic progenitors and myelomonocytic precursors. Adverse effects of GO treatment are primarily related to myelosuppression (infections, fever, bleedings). However, severe sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS) and hepatotoxicity have also been reported. Since the introduction of GO treatment into routine clinical practice, the incidence of SOS has been reported to span from 0% to 33%, but, the direct cause of the liver-associated effects remain unknown. Using immunohistochemistry we show that the CD33 receptor is widely distributed in the liver tissue and highly expressed on hepatocytes making them susceptible for targeted CD33 chemotherapy by GO. Moreover, utilizing CD163 as a specific marker for macrophages, double immunofluorescence staining revealed that Kupffer cells strongly express CD33. Therefore, the reported hepatoxicity associated with GO treatment may be due to accumulation of antibody-toxin conjugates in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells causing calicheamicin-induced damage.
