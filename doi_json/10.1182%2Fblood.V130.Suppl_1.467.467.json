    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients (pts) with AML harboring FLT3 -ITD mutations have poor outcomes. The higher relapse rate and inferior overall survival (OS) largely depend on the ITD mutant to wild-type (wt) allelic ratio. Furthermore, there is a strong gene-gene interaction between NPM1 mutation ( NPM1 mut ) and FLT3 -ITD. Consequently, the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) has included defined NPM1/FLT3- ITD genotypes for risk categorization. In the recent phase III RATIFY trial [NCT00651261; Stone et al., NEJM 2017] the addition of the multi-targeted kinase inhibitor midostaurin (M) to standard chemotherapy significantly prolonged OS and event-free survival (EFS) in pts with newly diagnosed AML and FLT3 mutation. Here, we evaluated the prognostic impact in a post-hoc analysis of the NPM1/FLT3 -ITD genotypes as defined by the 2017 ELN from randomized pts treated within the RATIFY trial. Study Design: In total, 428 of 717 pts were included who gave informed consent for biomarker analyses and who could be categorized to one of the 4 ELN NPM1 / FLT3 -ITD subgroups: NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD low (n=85), NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD high (n=159), NPM1 wt / FLT3 -ITD low (n=75), and NPM1 wt / FLT3 -ITD high (n=109) (allelic ratio: high, \u22650.5; low, <0.5). Median age of these pts was 47 years (yrs) (range, 18 to 59 yrs); median follow-up time was 59 months (mo) (range, 42 to 81 mo). Pts were randomly assigned to receive either M or placebo (PBO) together with standard induction and consolidation therapy followed by twelve 28-day cycles of maintenance therapy with either M or PBO. Results: With regard to pts and disease characteristics, there was a higher proportion of female pts in the subsets with concurrent NPM1 mut , whereas higher white blood cell counts (WBC) and bone marrow blasts were found in the subsets with FLT3 -ITD high . Rates of complete remission (CR) positively correlated with NPM1 mut status, but not with FLT3 -ITD allelic ratio (p=.016). CR according to randomization only showed a trend in favor of M in NPM1 wt / FLT3 -ITD low pts (p=.058). OS was significantly different among the 4 groups (p=.001); median survival times were mo not reached (n.r.), 27 mo, 20 mo, and 17 mo for NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD low , NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD high , NPM1 wt / FLT3 -ITD low , and NPM1 wt / FLT3 -ITD high subgroups, respectively. This effect was even more pronounced when censoring pts at the time of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). OS according to randomization showed some differential effects of M among the 4 genotypes (Figure 1) with a significant beneficial effect of M in the NPM1 wt / FLT3 -ITD high group (median OS 26 mo vs 14 mo for PBO; p=.025), whereas for the other genotypes beneficial effects of M did not reach statistical significance. OS analysis according to randomization censored at the time of alloHCT revealed an advantage of M for the NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD low (median n.r. in both arms; p=.038) and NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD high (median, n.r. vs 18 mo for PBO; p=.032) subsets, while the significant effect present in the non-censored analysis for the NPM1 wt / FLT3 -ITD high group was lost (median OS, 19 mo vs 17 mo for PBO; p=0.2). Similar to OS, non-censored EFS significantly differed among the 4 groups (p=.001); median EFS times were 16 mo, 8 mo, 4 mo, and 4 mo for the NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD low , NPM1 mut / FLT3 -ITD high , NPM1 wt / FLT3 -ITD low , and NPM1 wt / FLT3 -ITD high groups, respectively. EFS analysis according to randomization showed a beneficial effect of M in the NPM1 wt / FLT3 -ITD high group (median EFS, 8 mo vs 3 mo for PBO; p=.016). Multivariable analysis including the 4 NPM1/FLT3 -ITD genotypes, treatment arm, sex, age, WBC and alloHCT revealed NPM1/FLT3 -ITD genotypes (OS: p<.0001; EFS: p=.002), treatment arm with M in favor to PBO (OS: p=.011; EFS: p=.003), and WBC (OS: p=.015; EFS: p<.0001) as prognostic variables for OS and EFS while alloHCT was only significant for OS (p<.0001); and sex only for EFS (p=.017). Conclusions: Data from this large randomized trial suggest the high prognostic value of the NPM1/FLT3 -ITD genotypes considering the ITD mutant to wt allelic ratio. The study was not powered to show differential effects of M among genotypes; however, a beneficial effect of M on OS and EFS appeared most pronounced in the NPM1 wt / FLT3 -ITD high group. Multivariate analysis revealed NPM1/FLT3 -ITD genotypes, treatment arm with M in favor to PBO, WBC, and alloHCT as independent prognostic factors for OS.
