    "abstract_text": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) was recently identified as a major risk factor for development of both hematologic malignancies and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in humans. The most commonly mutated gene in CHIP, DNMT3A , is a de novo DNA methyltransferase. The second most commonly mutated gene is TET2 , an enzyme which can lead to loss of DNA methylation, and thus is thought to have an opposing biochemical function to DNMT3A . Surprisingly, mutations in both genes lead to convergent phenotypes, such as clonal expansion of mutated stem cells, increased risk of malignant transformation, and increased risk of coronary heart disease. A molecular mechanism linking CHIP and cardiovascular disease has been explored only for loss of function mutations in the Tet2 gene (Jaiswal et al., NEJM 2017; Fuster et al., Science 2017). Here we tested the ability of null mutations in Dnmt3a to contribute to atherosclerosis in hypercholesteremic mice. We further explored the biological basis for this association through gene expression analyses and single-cell RNA sequencing. To model cardiovascular disease associated with DNMT3A -mutated CHIP, atherosclerosis-prone Ldlr -/- mice received bone marrow from Dnmt3a +/+ mice (WT), or from Dnmt3a -/- mice (KO) and WT mice in a 1:9 ratio to mimic a typical variant allele fraction observed in human CHIP. Mice then consumed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet (HFD), and underwent assessment of atherosclerosis. At 9 weeks, mice that had received 10% Dnmt3a -/- bone marrow displayed an average lesion size that was 40% larger compared to mice receiving control marrow only (p=0.04). The increase in lesion size resembles that we previously observed in mice receiving Tet2 -/- marrow (Jaiswal et al., NEJM 2017). De novo DNA methylation by Dnmt3a can alter gene expression. To elucidate how such changes may accelerate atherosclerosis, we first performed transcriptome analysis using bulk RNA sequencing of cholesterol-stimulated bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) from either WT or KO mice. BMDMs lacking Dnmt3a showed significantly augmented expression of genes belonging to the CXC chemokine cluster, Cxcl1 , Cxcl2 and Cxcl3 , as well as increases in mRNAs encoding canonical pro-inflammatory cytokines Il1b and Il6 . These changes mirrored those we saw in macrophages lacking Tet2 (Jaiswal et al., NEJM 2017). We next asked how transcriptomic changes observed using the ex vivo BMDM system translated into the in vivo lesional environment. Single-cell RNA sequencing (10X Genomics) was performed on atherosclerotic aortae from mice that had been competitively transplanted with WT, Dnmt3a -/-, or Tet2 -/- marrow at a 1:9 ratio. Clustering demonstrated broad changes in lesional immune cell composition in mice harboring CHIP. Lack of either Tet2 or Dnmt3a substantially expanded the myeloid compartment, containing cells that drive atherogenesis. A reciprocal reduction mainly affecting T lymphocyte populations accompanied this expansion. Within the myeloid cell compartment, Dnmt3a -/- or Tet2 -/- donor cells, but not WT donor cells, gave rise to a distinct lesional macrophage population. These cells expressed markers associated with tissue-resident macrophages ( Mrc1 , Lyve1 , F13a1 ), but also highly expressed several inflammatory mediators ( Cxcl1 , Pf4 , Ccl2 , Ccl7 , Ccl8 ), and a characteristic set of transcription factors ( Jun , Fos , Egr1 ). Overall, the present study reveals broad changes to the lesional cellular composition and transcriptome induced by the most common CHIP mutations, and provides novel insight into the mechanisms by which CHIP accelerates atherosclerosis. Despite exerting opposite catalytic functions, lack of Dnmt3a or of Tet2 function lead to a myriad of similar downstream transcriptomic and cellular changes. These results indicate that mutations in Dnmt3a and Tet2 accelerate atherosclerosis through convergent mechanisms. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
