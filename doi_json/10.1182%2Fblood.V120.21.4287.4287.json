NHL treatment may significantly impact health related quality of life (HRQOL) in older patients and thereby have long-term adverse physical and mental consequences. One recent evaluation of HRQOL following a cancer diagnosis among patients age '65 indicated a significant decrease following any NHL diagnosis, particularly in the physical health component. However, NHL is a collection of distinct disease entities, with widely varied clinical course. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a prevalent subtype often treated with curative intent. In this analysis, we evaluate HRQOL among patients diagnosed with DLBCL, using a novel nationally representative population-based dataset, and describe patterns in HRQOL by time from diagnosis. Methods: The National Cancer Institute sponsored Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medical Health Outcomes Survey (SEER-MHOS) linkage database is a research resource that allows for evaluation of HRQOL in cancer patients and survivors. The MHOS was administered annually to cohorts of patients randomly selected from Medicare Advantage health plans; each cohort was surveyed at baseline and 2 years later in follow-up. The MHOS measured HRQOL using the SF-36, an instrument with established reliability and validity for patients with cancer. The questions of the SF-36 capture data on 8 dimensions of general health that are grouped into physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) summary scores, capturing physical function and emotional well-being, respectively. Patients included in 6 cohorts (baseline 1998\u20132003; last follow-up on cohort 6 in 2005) were linked to the SEER database. For this cross-sectional analysis, we selected all patients age \u226565 that had a diagnosis of DLBCL (ICD-O-3 8680, 8684); HRQOL responses from the first available survey after DLBCL were used. SF-36 PCS and MCS (both scales range from 0\u2013100) and poor self-rated health (self \u2013reported fair or poor general health compared to other people your age) were compared among DLBCL patients by time from diagnosis to survey: 0\u20131, 1\u20133, and 3\u20135 years. HRQOL was also compared to patients that had MHOS data >1 year prior to a DLBCL diagnosis. Differences in PCS and MCS median scores were tested using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and differences in the proportions of participants reporting fair or poor self-rated health were tested using the \u03c7 2 statistic. Results: Median age and range for patients surveyed before, 0\u20131 (n=62), 1\u20133 (n=76), or 3\u20135 (n=31) years after their DLBCL diagnosis was similar (medians 73, 75, 74, and 78 years old, respectively; p=0.37). Date ranges for DLBCL diagnoses are as follows: 1997\u20132005, 1995\u20132004, and 1993\u20131998 for those surveyed 0\u20131, 1\u20133, and 3\u20135 year after diagnosis. HRQOL and self-rated health were low among the patients surveyed prior to their DLBCL diagnosis (n=296; PCS median=45.0, MCS median=56.3, poor self-rated health: 22.3%). In comparison, patients surveyed 0\u20131 year after DBCL diagnosis have even worse HRQOL scores (PCS median=33.6, MCS median=40.8, poor self-rated health: 51.6%; p=<0.0001 for all three comparisons). While older DLBCL patients surveyed 3\u20135 years from diagnosis have better quality of life (PCS median=36.0, MCS median=53.3, poor self-rated health fair: 29.0%) in comparison to the participants surveyed 0\u20131 year after diagnosis, PCS is still significantly different from the similarly aged group that was surveyed before their DLBCL (p=0.021). Conclusion: In this SEER-MHOS population of older patients with a history of DLBCL, HRQOL is surprisingly low. Older patients prior to DLBCL had low scores on both the physical and mental components of the SF-36, indicating vulnerability prior to diagnosis and treatment. HRQOL and self-rated health was statistically and clinically worse among DLBCL patients less than a year out from diagnosis, possibly due to therapy. Notably, HRQOL remains low, compared to pre-diagnosis, in patients surveyed 3\u20135 years out from diagnosis, particularly in the physical domains. This study provides a benchmark for HRQOL among older patients with DLBCL, an NHL subtype in which aggressive treatment with curative intent is a standard approach, and further research that evaluates HRQOL prospectively in vulnerable older patients receiving treatment for DLBCL is critical.
