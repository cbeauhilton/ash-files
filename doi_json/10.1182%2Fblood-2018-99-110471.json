    "abstract_text": "Early clinical results using BCMA targeted CAR T cell therapies for advanced multiple myeloma (MM) have shown promise. However, BCMA expression can be variable, and BCMA downregulation has been correlated with relapse (Brudno J. JCO. 2018; Cohen A. ASH. 2017). Targeting multiple antigens may enhance response durability. We report that the orphan seven transmembrane G protein coupled receptor, GPRC5D, is an attractive additional target for CAR T cell therapy of MM. GPRC5D mRNA expression was previously identified in bone marrow cells from patients with MM; however its protein expression could not be detected with available FACS reagents (Frigyesi I. Blood. 2014). We evaluated 83 primary marrow samples by quantitative immunofluorescence (Q-IF) for CD138, BCMA, and GPRC5D. In 98% of the samples, CD138 + cells expressed surface GPRC5D. In most samples, the majority of CD138 + cells expressed both BCMA and GPRC5D, however, in several cases the dominant CD138 + population expressed only BCMA or GPRC5D, with GPRC5D expression independent of BCMA across samples (R 2 =0.156; Figure 1). The potential for \"on target/off tumor\" binding by targeting GPRC5D was evaluated by screening 30 essential normal tissue types by IHC (n=3 donors/type) followed by validation of any positive findings by RNA in situ hybridization and quantitative PCR. Results in non-plasma cell normal tissue were consistent with prior reports of GPRC5D off target expression restricted to cells from the hair follicle, a potentially immune privileged site. We developed GPRC5D-targeted CARs considering immunogenicity, spacer length, and tonic signaling. To minimize potential anti-CAR immunity, a human B cell-derived phage display library was screened. Seven diverse and highly specific human single chain variable fragments (scFvs) were identified. 42 CARs were derived from the 7 scFvs by modifying scFv orientation (V H /V L ; V L /V H ) and incorporating a short, medium, or long IgG4 based spacer. To monitor CAR-mediated signaling, we transduced each CAR into a Jurkat reporter line with RFP inserted in-frame, downstream of endogenous NR4A1 (Nur77). Nur77 expression is an immediate-early, specific marker of CD3z signaling (Ashouri J. J Immunol. 2017). Using this reporter, we observed that (1) a long spacer provided enhanced antigen-dependent activation across all anti-GPRC5D CARs; and (2) the use of different scFvs resulted in vastly different levels of tonic signaling. We selected potential lead and backup constructs and evaluated CAR activity on primary human T cells. When co-cultured specifically with MM cell lines, anti-GPRC5D CAR T cells secreted a polyfunctional cytokine profile, proliferated, and effectively lysed target cells. CD138 + /CD38 hi primary MM bone marrow aspirate cells were also specifically lysed. In vivo efficacy of GPRC5D-targeted CAR T cells was evaluated in NSG mice engrafted with a human MM cell line (ffLuc + ) bone marrow xenograft. Donor T cells were gene-modified to express anti-GPRC5D CARs with either a 4-1BB or a CD28 co-stimulatory domain and membrane-anchored Gaussia luciferase (GLuc). Compared to control CAR T cells specific for an irrelevant target, anti-GPRC5D CAR T cells with either co-stimulatory domain proliferated and homed to the site of MM (Gluc imaging), eradicated MM xenograft (ffLuc imaging), and increased survival (Figure 2). One scFv that was highly functional in our GPRC5D CAR screen was evaluated for off-target binding against either >200 G protein-coupled receptors (cell based), or >4000 human transmembrane proteins (scFv-Fc based), and demonstrated binding only to GPRC5D. Studies with murine and cynomolgus cross-reactive GPRC5D targeting CARs did not show signs of alopecia or other unexpected toxicity in either species. In a murine model of post-BCMA CAR T cell treated antigen escape (CRISPR BCMA KO of a subpopulation of MM cells), anti-GPRC5D CAR T cells rescue BCMA - relapse. These results indicate that GPRC5D will be an important target for the immunotherapy of MM. We are translating this 4-1BB-containing, human-derived, GPRC5D-targeted CAR construct to the clinic.
