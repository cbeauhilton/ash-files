    "abstract_text": "Background: CMV-related complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality post allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Where a pre-emptive strategy is used, early detection is crucial as this will minimise the risk of CMV infection progressing to CMV disease. As a result, PCR techniques are increasingly replacing pp65 antigen detection as a means of monitoring CMV viral load in at-risk patients. Initiating treatment at too low a cut-off may result in over-treatment since very low level viraemia may not necessarily represent live or replicating virus. However, using too high a cut-off might lead to unacceptable treatment delay. As a result of these uncertainties the optimal pre-emptive strategy remains unknown. We therefore sought to determine whether, using quantitative real time PCR, the manufacturer\u2019s detection cut-off or the validated lower quantitation limit (LQL) was the more appropriate treatment trigger. Methods: CMV surveillance was done by weekly (twice weekly for positive results) quantitative real time PCR (Artus RealArt\u2122 CMV LC PCR Kit, Hamburg, Germany) until immunosuppression was stopped. The manufacturer\u2019s detection cut-off was 6.5 \u00d7 10 2 copies/ml and the validated LQL was 1 \u00d7 10 4 copies/ml. Treatment was initiated following two consecutive results above the LQL. Below the LQL, treatment was only started if symptoms of CMV infection (e.g. fever, cytopenia) were also present. Results: Between 01/04 and 12/05 fourty four patients, median age 43y (range 18\u201369), underwent ASCT from sibling (n=27) or unrelated (n=17) donors for AML/MDS (n=22), ALL (n=8), CML (n=5), NHL (n=5), myeloma (n=3) and osteogenesis imperfecta (n=1). The conditioning regimen was myeloablative (Cy-TBI, Bu-Cy) in 21/44 and reduced intensity (Flu-Mel, Flu-Cy) in 23/44. Campath-1H was used in 16/44. The recipient/donor CMV serostatus was R+/D+ (n=11), R+/D\u2212 (n=9), R\u2212/D+ (n=4) and R\u2212/D\u2212 (n=20). With a median follow up of 10 months (range <1\u201326), 12/24 (50%) patients at high risk of CMV reactivation (6 of 11 R+/D+, 6 of 9 R+/D\u2212, 0 of 4 R\u2212/D+) had CMV detected compared with 1/20 (5%) low risk R\u2212/D\u2212 patients. CMV detection occurred at a median of 21d (range 3\u2013128) post ASCT. 12/13 patients with detectable CMV had initial levels below the LQL. All required treatment, 5 because of co-existent symptoms of CMV infection despite consecutive readings below the LQL and 7 because the second reading was above the LQL. Conditioning therapy, donor type and use of CAMPATH-1H did not appear to influence risk of CMV detection. There was no CMV related death in this cohort. Conclusion: We conclude that, using the above kit, the detection cut-off of 6.5 \u00d7 10 2 copies/ml rather than the manufacturer\u2019s validated LQL of 1 \u00d7 10 4 /ml is the more appropriate trigger for initiating pre-emptive anti-CMV therapy in patients undergoing ASCT. Since manufacturers do not consider quantification below the LQL to be reliable, we recommend that where the detection cut-off is significantly lower than the LQL, transplant centres seek to determine their own appropriate treatment trigger.",
