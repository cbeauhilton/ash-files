    "abstract_text": "Lipid rafts, which are membrane microdomains that are rich in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, have been implicated in the regulation of intracellular protein trafficking. Furthermore, we have previously shown that SNAREs mediate granule-plasma membrane fusion during exocytosis in platelets, and that IKK\u03b2 regulates SNAREs and granule exocytosis. Based on these considerations, we sought to investigate the regulatory relationship between IKK\u03b2 and lipid rafts, by employing the PF4-Cre/IKK\u03b2 flox/flox platelets. We demonstrate that lipid rafts play a critical role in mediating IKK\u03b2 -/- -dependent regulation of SNARE proteins and SNARE complexes. Specifically, we found that methyl \u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD, which disrupts lipid rafts) is able to inhibit platelet aggregation, dense and alpha granule secretion, PS exposure and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin activation. We also observed that M\u03b2CD is able to inhibit platelet spreading, clot retraction, as well as 7S complex formation. In terms of co-localization, the SNARE protein SNAP-23 was found to associate with a lipid raft marker and was present in detergent-insoluble lipid raft microdomains in control platelets, but not in the IKK\u03b2 -/- platelets. Furthermore, in resting platelets, plasma membrane SNARE proteins such as syntaxin-11 and SNAP-23 or the granule-associated SNARE vesicle-associated membrane protein VAMP-8 were neither present in the microdomains of control platelets, nor in those from IKK\u03b2 -/- mice. Interestingly however, agonist/thrombin stimulation led to the relocation of syntaxin-11 and VAMP-8 into the lipid rafts, and as part of raft-associated phospho-SNAP-23/syntaxin-11/VAMP-8 complexes in control platelets. This seems to be IKK\u03b2 dependent, as these associations did not take place in the IKK\u03b2 -/- platelets. Taken together, these data reveal a critical role for the IKK\u03b2/lipid rafts axis in regulating platelet exocytosis, via the spatial regulation of SNARE proteins.
