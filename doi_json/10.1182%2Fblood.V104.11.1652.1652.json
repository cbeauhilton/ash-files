    "abstract_text": "Recent studies suggest that detection of subclinical, or minimal residual disease (MRD) in apheresis products used for autografting correlates with poor disease-free survival following ASCT for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). To validate this observation and to gain insights into the kinetics of MRD during treatment, we are performing a prospective analysis of MRD using quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) in patients (pts) undergoing treatment for MCL on a CALGB study (59909). Q-PCR of sequential paired bone marrow (BM) and blood (B) samples and of apheresis products was performed using either a patient-specific immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH) or BCL-1 gene rearrangement. All samples were analyzed in triplicate using LightCycler technology and reported as a normalized ratio of IgH or BCL-1 copy number to GAPDH copy number. The sensitivity of the assay ranged from 1 X 10 4 \u20131 X 10 5 . To date, a clonal IgH or BCL-1 gene rearrangement was detected in 36 of 41 (88%) pts entered on study. Patient-specific primers and consensus probes were used for Q-PCR monitoring of MRD following two courses of intensive induction therapy, during stem cell mobilization, and 3 and 12 months after ASCT and post-transplant immunotherapy with Rituximab (R). 27 pts have completed all protocol treatment with a median follow-up of 7 months (range: 0\u201328). 26 pts were evaluated for MRD following two courses of induction therapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and R. 10 of 26 became MRD negative (\u2212) following induction while 16 remained MRD positive (+). Following mobilization with high-dose cytarabine, etoposide and R, apheresis products from 9 of 10 MRD- pts were evaluated and all products were MRD- (1 pt not evaluable). Of the 16 pts who were MRD+ prior to mobilization therapy, MRD- apheresis products were collected in 8; 5 had MRD+ stem cell collections, and 3 were not evaluable. In total, apheresis products were evaluable in 22 of 26 pts; 17 (77%) had MRD- stem cells collected prior to ASCT. None of these MRD- pts has relapsed to date although 2 pts with MRD- products became weakly MRD+ 12 months following ASCT and R. Of the 5 pts with MRD+ apheresis collections, 4 have remained persistently MRD+ following ASCT and R; 1 has relapsed 19 months after completion of all treatment. Rising levels of MRD in BM and B samples were noted in this patient 3 and 12 months post-ASCT. Statistical comparison of MRD values in paired BM and B samples prior to, and post-ASCT demonstrated good agreement with an intraclass correlation coefficient of.814 and.777, respectively. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that prospective MRD monitoring using Q-PCR provides important insights into the kinetics of response during treatment of MCL. MRD- apheresis products were collected in the majority of pts following intensive induction and mobilization chemo-immunotherapy with R on CALGB 59909. To date, no pts with MRD- apheresis products have relapsed following ASCT. In contrast, it appears that pts with MRD+ apheresis products remain MRD+ following ASCT and R and may be more likely to relapse. Longer clinical follow-up is needed to clarify the significance of the persistence of MRD in apheresis products and following ASCT for MCL.",
