    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Treatment of fludarabine-resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients is an unmet clinical need. Fludarabine resistance in CLL depends on intrinsic molecular features of the tumor cells, and on bidirectional interactions occurring between CLL cells and stromal cells (SC) of the tumor microenvironment. One of the main players of SC-induced fludarabine resistance is the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. CXCR4 is a G protein-coupled receptor constitutively expressed on CLL cells. The binding of CXCR4 with CXCL12 activates the Ras/ERK1-2/Akt and the RhoA-dependent signalling pathways. To be active transducers Ras and RhoA need to undergo a post-translational modification (i.e. isoprenylation) by means of small molecules produced by the mevalonate (Mev) pathway. We have recently demonstrated that the Mev pathway is more active in IGHV unmutated than in mutated CLL cells, and is amenable to pharmacological manipulation by statins (i.e. simvastatin [Sim]). It is currently unknown whether the Mev pathway and its pharmacological targeting are implicated in the modulation of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis and in the SC-induced fludarabine resistance of CLL cells. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the reciprocal interactions between the Mev pathway and the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, in order to identify potential targets to counteract the constitutive and SC-induced fludarabine resistance of CLL cells. METHODS: Immuno-magnetically purified patient-derived CLL cells were cultured alone or with murine SC (M2-10B4 cell line). In selected experiments, cell cultures were exposed to human recombinant CXCL12 (100 \u03bcg/ml), CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 (5 \u03bcg/ml), fludarabine (F-ara-A, 10 \u03bcM), Sim (1 \u03bcM), ERK1-2 kinase inhibitor PD98059 (10 \u03bcM), RhoA kinase inhibitor Y276 (10 \u03bcM), HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor YC-1 (10 \u03bcM). The activity of the Mev pathway was measured by the quantification of metabolites [i.e. cholesterol and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP)] produced by CLL cells after 24 h incubation with 1 \u03bcCi of [ 3 H]acetate. Ras and RhoA activities were evaluated measuring their GTP-bound fraction, taken as an index of the G-protein activation, respectively by pull-down assay and by an ELISA based assay. ERK1-2 and HIF-1\u03b1 phosphorylation were evaluated by Western Blot. RhoA kinase, Akt and HIF-1\u03b1 activities were measured with specific immunoassay kit. The amount of CXCL12 in culture supernatants was assessed by ELISA assay. Cell viability was determined by Annexin-V/propidium Iodide immunostaining and flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: Co-culture with SC upregulated the Mev pathway activity of CLL cells, as shown by the increased production of cholesterol and FPP. This SC-induced increase in the Mev pathway activity was followed by the activation of the downstream Ras/ERK1-2 and RhoA/RhoA kinase signalling, the upregulation of the pro-survival factor Akt, and an increase in the transcriptional activity of HIF-1\u03b1. These biological and molecular effects were identically observed when CLL cells were exposed to recombinant CXCL12, and were completely abrogated by the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, thus showing the key role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in the SC-induced modulation of the Mev pathway and the downstream Ras/ERK1-2 and RhoA/RhoA kinase signalling. On the other hand, blocking the Mev pathway by Sim and targeting ERK1-2 kinases, RhoA kinase and HIF-1\u03b1 by specific small-molecule inhibitors significantly reduced the constitutive activity and the SC-induced upregulation of the Ras/ERK1-2 and RhoA/RhoA kinase signal transduction. A regulatory role of the Mev pathway on the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis was observed not only in CLL cells but also in SC, as shown by the significant reduction in CXCL12 secretion by SC exposed to Sim. In the last set of experiments, we found that the inhibition of the Mev pathway by Sim potentiated the direct cytotoxic effect of fludarabine against CLL cells. Even more importantly, both Sim and the downstream HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor YC-1 were capable of counteracting the SC-mediated protection of CLL cells from fludarabine-induced cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the Mev pathway has a regulatory role on the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis and on the SC-mediated protective effects toward spontaneous and fludarabine-induced CLL cell death. The upstream inhibition of the Mev pathway and the downstream targeting of HIF-1\u03b1 are promising strategies to circumvent fludarabine resistance in CLL.
