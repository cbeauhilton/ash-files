    "abstract_text": "Despite the significant advances in developing novel therapies for hemoglobinopathies, developing a universal and robust therapeutic approach, able to achieve an event-free result in all \u03b2 0 /\u03b2 0 thalassemic and sickle cell patients is a work in progress. It is known that increase of Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can lead to an ameliorated clinical picture up to transfusion independency. Inactivation via genome editing of \u03b3-globin suppressors or introduction of Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin (HPFH) mutations in the promoter of hemoglobin gamma (HBG) have been shown to significantly increase the endogenous HbF expression. Here we studied the effect in HbF reactivation by targeting the binding site of the two main HbF silencers, BCL11a and LRF and how it compares to the well-established editing of the BCL11a erythroid enhancer. Furthermore, in order to achieve higher levels of fetal hemoglobin, we assayed the effect of all combinations of these cis and trans acting mutations. We first observed that all single knock outs had similar effects in HbF reactivation. Interestingly, by targeting both sites in the gamma globin promoter we observed a decrease in HbF induction compared to each single edit, suggesting a possible binding of a gamma globin activator in the in-between region. However, editing of the BCL11a erythroid enhancer and either of the two silencer binding sites yielded maximum levels of fetal hemoglobin, with pancellular HbF expression, both in vitro and in vivo following xeno-transplantation in NSGW mice. Collectively, our data suggest that the combination of two fetal globin reactivation mutations, one cis and one trans, have the potential to significantly increase HbF both totally and on per cell basis. This strategy has the potential to induce higher levels of HbF reactivation with a clinical benefit in patients with beta globin disorders. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
