    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are myeloid neoplasms characterized by dysplasia in one or more cell lines, ineffective hematopoiesis, and variable risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). As any other neoplasm, MDS is expected to be driven by mutation, and its c lonal evolution is likely a multistep process in which several genetic events occur. Somatic mutations of TET2 have been found in about 25% of MDS patients, while additional mutant genes (including ASXL1 , ETV6 , EZH2 , IDH1 , IDH2 , RUNX1 , and TP53 ) have been detected in smaller proportions of patients, particularly in those with poor prognosis. Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) is a phenotypically well-defined subtype of MDS, characterized by 15% or more ring sideroblasts (RS, erythroblasts with perinuclear iron-loaded mitochondria) in the bone marrow. We reasoned that the identification of recurrently mutated genes in RARS could provide novel insights into molecular pathogenesis of MDS, and used massively parallel sequencing technology to identify somatically acquired point mutations across all protein-coding exons in the genome in 8 patients with RARS. We identified 62 point mutations across the 8 patients, and the mutation spectrum showed a predominance of transitions, especially C>T/G>A mutations. Within 5/8 patients studied, the observed proportion of reads reporting a mutant allele showed significantly greater variability than expected by chance, indicating that the population of malignant cells was genetically heterogeneous. In 6/8 RARS patients, we identified recurrent somatic mutations (found in granulocytes but not in T-lymphocytes) in a gene that encodes a core component of the RNA splicing machinery, SF3B1 . Based on the proportion of reads reporting the mutant allele, the mutations all appeared to be heterozygous and present in the dominant clone of cells. To characterize the spectrum and frequency of SF3B1 mutations in greater detail, both in myeloid malignancies and other cancers, we undertook targeted resequencing of the gene. In particular, we studied patients with MDS, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) or AML evolving from MDS. Somatic mutations of SF3B1 were found in 150/533 (28.1%) patients with MDS, 16/83 (19.3%) patients with MDS/MPN, and 2/38 (5.3%) patients with AML. The gene was also mutated in 1\u20135% of diverse other tumor types. All mutations appeared to be heterozygous substitutions, and we observed no frameshift indels, splice site mutations or nonsense substitutions. The mutations clustered in exons 12\u201315 of the gene, and K700E accounted for 97/168 (57.7%) of the variants observed. SF3B1 mutations were less deleterious than expected by chance, implying that the mutated protein retains structural integrity with altered function. Gene expression profiling revealed SF3B1 mutations are associated with down-regulation of key gene networks, including core mitochondrial pathways. Close relationships were found between mutant SF3B1 and presence of RS ( P <.001), and between mutant allele burden and percentage of RS ( P =.002). Overall, 83/105 (79%) of patients with RARS, 30/54 (57.7%) of those with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and RS, and 12/18 (66.7%) of those with RARS associated with marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T) carried a somatic mutation of SF3B1 . On the other hand, 97% of patients carrying a mutant SF3B1 had RS, and the mutant gene had a positive predictive value for RS of 97.7% (95% CI, 93.5\u201399.5%). We then studied the prognostic significance of the genetic lesion. In multivariable analysis including established risk factors, SF3B1 mutations were independently associated with better overall survival (HR=0.18, P =.028) and lower risk of progression to AML (HR=0.32, P =.048). In conclusion, mutations in SF3B1 implicate abnormalities of mRNA splicing, a pathway not previously known as a target for mutation, in the pathogenesis of MDS. The close relationship between this molecular lesion and RS is consistent with a causal relationship, and makes SF3B1 the first gene to be strongly associated with a specific morphological feature in MDS. Finally, SF3B1 mutations are independent predictors of favorable clinical outcome, and their detection may improve risk assessment in MDS.
