    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCTION. Germinal centers (GC) are unique sites in peripheral lymphoid tissue where clonal selection of B cells takes place. This occurs as a response to stimulation by various antigens originating, sometimes, follicular hyperplasia (FH). GC have been known as a major source of B-cell lymphomas including follicular (FL) and diffuse large cell (DLCL). DNA methylation of tumor-suppressor genes is a mechanism of gene silencing involved in the pathogenesis of FL and DLCL. Much less is known about the role of methylation in FH. We determined the methylation status of 6 tumor-suppressor genes in 43 patients with FH, 18 patients with FL and 49 patients with DLCL in order to see the differential implication of this epigenetic mechanism in the pathological and the physiological development of GC. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Genomic DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded samples of 43 FH, 18 FL and 49 DLCL after being treated with EZ DNA-Methylation Kit (Zymo Research) with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, were analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain-reaction to determine promoter hypermethylation of DAP-k, SHP1, Rar\u03b2, p14, SHP1, MGMT and PDRM1. All samples were obtained mostly from lymph nodes and tonsils. Diagnosis was based on morphology and immunohistochemistry analysis. All cases were matched for age, sex and ethnic origin. RESULTS: DAP-k promoter methylation occurred with higher frequency in FL(89%) than in DLCL(78%) and FH(40%). SHP1 was methylated in 61% of FL, 58% of FH and 23% of DLCL. RARb was methylated in 67% of FL patients, 30% of DLCL and only 12% of FH. Eight (44%) FL, seventeen (35%) DLCL and four (10%) BFH patients showed MGMT methylation. Promoter hypermethylation of p14 was detected only in 5 (12%) FH, 2 (4%) DLCL and none FL patients. Methylation of PRMD1 was present only in 1 (6%) FL, 2 (6%) DLCL and 1 (4%) FH samples. CONCLUSIONS. Inactivacion of DAP-K and SHP1 is present in B-cell malignancies, DLCL and FL, and BFH. Therefore, it may represent a physiologic event conferring a temporal survival advantage necessary for a GC hyperplastic response. Inactivation of the retinoic acid response through the methylation of Rara\u0302 is significantly more frequent in lymphomas than in FH. As reported in other tumors methylation of MGMT is more frequent in lymphomas than in FH. With our data methylation of Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p14 is not a differential pathogenic event in lymphomas of GC origin, in fact it is more frequent in FH. Promoter Methylation of PDRM1 is not the mechanism involved in lymphomagenesis in FL and DLCL, the two FH positive deserve further follow-up to determine its significance.",
