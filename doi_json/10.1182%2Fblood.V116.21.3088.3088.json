    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3088 Background: Despite the use of modern immunochemotherapy (R-CHOP) regimens, almost 50% of patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) will relapse. Current prognostic models, most notably the International Prognostic Index, are comprised of patient and tumor characteristics and are unable to identify patients with less than a 50% chance of long-term survival. However, recent observations demonstrate that factors related to host adaptive immunity and the tumor microenvironment are powerful prognostic variables in non-Hodgkin lymphoma Methods: We retrospectively examined the absolute neutrophil count (ANC), monocyte count (AMC) and lymphocyte count (ALC), obtained from an automated complete blood count with differential, as prognostic variables in a cohort of 255 consecutive DLBCL patients that were uniformly treated with R-CHOP between 2000 and 2007 at a single institution. The primary study objective was to assess if ANC, AMC, and ALC at diagnosis were predictors of overall survival (OS) in DLBCL. Results: At diagnosis, the median ANC was 4720/uL (range 1190\u201317690), the median AMC was 610/uL (range 30\u20134040), and the median ALC was 1220/uL (range 140\u20135410). The median follow-up for these patients was 48 months. In the univariate analysis, each of these variables predicted OS as continuous variables. As dichotomized variables, an elevated ANC (\u22655500/\u03bcL; hazard ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.14\u20132.60, p=0.01) and AMC (\u2265610/\u03bcL; hazard ratio 3.36, 95% confidence interval 2.10\u20135.59, p1000/uL), good (AMC \u2265610/uL or ALC \u22641000/uL), and poor-risk (AMC \u2265610/uL and ALC \u22641000/uL) populations. For both the very good (n=79) and good-risk (n=134) groups median OS has not been reached with estimated 5-year overall survival of 88% and 69%, respectively. Median OS for poor-risk (n=42) patients was 1.7 years (95% confidence interval 1.1\u20132.7 years) with an estimated 5-year overall survival of 28% (p<0.0001). By comparison, the R-IPI was unable to identify a group of patients with a median survival less than 8 years. The estimated 5-year OS was 93%, 71% and 53% for very good, good and poor-risk patients, respectively. We sought to determine whether the AMC/ALC PI may provide additional prognostic information when combined with the R-IPI. To test this possibility, the 171 very good/good risk and 84 poor risk patients identified by the R-IPI were subsequently risk stratified using the AMC/ALC PI. Among R-IPI very good/good risk patients a subset of poor risk patients (n=21) with a median OS of 2.2 years (95% confidence interval 1.1\u20136.6 years) and 35% 5-year OS could be identified with the AMC/ALC PI. In contrast, 5-year OS ranged from 75%-88% among very good and good risk patients. Similarly, stratification of R-IPI poor risk patients by the AMC/ALC PI identified subsets of very good (n=19) and good risk (n=44) patients with median OS that had not been reached and 86% and 55% 5-year OS, respectively. High risk (n=21) patients had a median OS of 1.4 years (95% confidence interval 0.9\u20132.2 years) and an estimated 5-year OS of less than 25%. Conclusions: Measurement of AMC and ALC at diagnosis is widely applicable, cost effective, predicts OS, and identifies high-risk patients with DLBCL.
