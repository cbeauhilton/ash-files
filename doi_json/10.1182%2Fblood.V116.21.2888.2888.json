Humanized anti-CD74 mAb, milatuzumab (Immunomedics, Morris Plains, NJ), exhibits direct cytotoxicity for NHL, CLL and MM cell lines, and is undergoing clinical evaluation for treatment of these malignancies. CD74 is upregulated by interferons in hematologic and epithelial cancer cell lines. Here we present the results of our analysis of CD74 expression and function in AML, and the effect of CD74 upregulation by treatment with IFN-\u03b3 on the cytotoxicity of milatuzumab for AML cell lines. Methods: CD74 expression in bone marrow biopsy (BMB) specimens from non-M3 AML patients was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and, for the 3 human AML cell lines, by flow cytometry, with/without permeabilization and with/without IFN-\u03b3 (40 and 200 U/mL). These cell lines were also tested in proliferation assays for responses to milatuzumab, with/without IFN-\u03b3. Also, assessment of apoptosis and cellular signaling was performed. Results: In the initial group of AML cases, 13/14 BMB specimens showed moderate to strong CD74 expression by leukemic blasts, which was mostly intracellular, usually with a perinuclear distribution. Three AML cell lines also showed moderate to strong expression of CD74, which was mostly intracellular. Without IFN-\u03b3, surface expression of CD74 was present, but IFN-\u03b3 treatment of these 3 lines resulted in upregulation of surface CD74 by 69\u2013117%. Much higher levels of intracellular CD74 were observed in all 3 lines (with and without IFN-\u03b3), with IFN-\u03b3-induced upregulation of intracellular CD74 in all 3 lines (from 85%-868%; P <0.001). In 2/3 lines, IFN-\u03b3 increased milatuzumab-mediated growth inhibition (23.7 to 44.8% and -3.9 to 30.9%, P =0.01 and P <0.05, respectively). Cytotoxicity was in part due to apoptosis, as significant increases in Annexin V binding ( P =0.01) were observed after treatment with IFN-\u03b3 plus milatuzumab. Initial experiments addressing cellular signaling suggest a role for AKT, because phosphorylated AKT levels increased ( P =0.06) in response to IFN-\u03b3 + milatuzumab. Conclusions: CD74 is expressed in AML patient specimens and in AML cell lines, with the majority of CD74 expression found intracellularly. Cell surface and cytoplasmic expression of CD74 were upregulated in AML lines after IFN-\u03b3 exposure. This increased expression resulted in increased cytotoxicity of the anti-CD74 mAb, milatuzumab, in 2/3 AML lines. This effect was through apoptosis and involved the AKT pathway. Thus, AML is another cancer type where combined IFN-\u03b3 and milatuzumab treatment may be useful. Supported in part by NIH grant PO1-CA103985 (DMG).
