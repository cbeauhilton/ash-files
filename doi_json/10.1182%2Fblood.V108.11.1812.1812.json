    "abstract_text": "We investigated the role of survivin in angiogenesis during zebrafish development. Morpholinos (MOs) targeting the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) (Sur UTR ) and sequences flanking the initiation codon (Sur ATG ) of zebrafish survivin-1 gene were injected into embryos at 1\u20134 cell stage. Vasculature was examined by microangiography and GFP expression in Tg(fli1:GFP) embryos. In embryos co-injected with Sur UTR and Sur ATG -MOs, vasculogenesis was intact but angiogenesis was markedly perturbed, especially in the inter-segmental vessels (ISV) of the trunk, the inner optic circle and optic veins of developing eyes and the sub-intestinal vessels. Apoptosis was increased, as shown by TUNEL staining and increase in caspase-3 activity. Efficacy of Sur UTR and Sur ATG -MOs was demonstrated by translation inhibition of co-injected 5\u2032UTR survivin:GFP plasmids. The phenotypes could be recapitulated by splice-site MO targeting the exon2-intron junction of survivin gene and rescued by survivin mRNA. Injection of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein induced ectopic angiogenesis and increased survivin expression, whereas treatment with a VEGF receptor inhibitor markedly reduced angiogenesis and suppressed survivin expression. Hematopoietic cell development at 18 hpf, before the onset of circulation, was unaffected in the survivin MO injected embryos. In conclusion, survivin is involved in angiogenesis during zebrafish development and is under VEGF regulation.",
