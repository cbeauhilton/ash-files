    "abstract_text": "Objectives: Although haemophilia patients with inhibitors are rare, the clinical, humanistic and economic consequences associated with this disorder are considerable. The primary treatment for such patients is either rFVIIa or aPCC. The aim of this study was to identify, review and evaluate the quality of the published literature on the relative cost-effectiveness of rFVIIa and aPCC in treating haemophilia patients with inhibitors. Methods: The review concentrates on the model type, the model design, model assumptions, and results. Results: The results of this study suggest that rFVIIa may be the cost-effective alternative to treatment with aPCC due to the superior efficacy of rFVIIa and hence the avoidance of subsequent lines of treatment. In 7 of the 9 studies, rFVIIa had the lower average treatment cost. The adapted modelling framework is similar in all the economic models reviewed, suggesting clinical acceptability of the approach used. The estimates of efficacy varied between the models, especially for aPCC. The efficacy for aPCC derived from retrospective studies was lower than reported in the literature. Sensitivity analysis had been undertaken in the majority of the economic analyses and the results were found to be robust to realistic parameter variations. Only one of the studies was a cost-utility study, showing the lack of measuring health status within this area. The results showed the large impact appropriate treatment can have on the quality of life for haemophilia patients with inhibitors. Conclusions: Ideally, there should be a systematic approach to identifying the relevant data and the lack of data from relevant randomized head-to-head trials is a contributing factor to the variation in efficacy rates and average dosages assumed. However, this systematic review has shown that despite differences in the estimates of efficacy, average dosage required, and unit costs the overall results are robust and appear to favour rFVIIa as the cost-effectiveness treatment for haemophilia patients with inhibitors."
