    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUD Improved care and prophylactic factor replacement therapy have lengthened life expectancy for persons with hemophilia (PWH). These advancements have created a new hemophilia cohort of senior persons not seen since the previous human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) years, and little is known about their age-related health outcomes. OBJECTIVES We describe the impact of hemophilia on comorbidities, joint problems, healthcare utilization and health related quality of life (HRQoL) from the HUGS VII baseline data. METHODS HUGS VII prospectively examines the cost and burden of hemophilia, including HRQoL, arthropathy, and economic impact in persons with hemophilia A or B age \u2265 40 years who obtained care from three US Hemophilia Treatment Centers. Participants completed a standardized interview to collect clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, hemophilia treatment regimen, pain, joint problems, comorbidities, and HRQoL using EQ-5D-3L. Clinical chart reviews documented hemophilic severity and treatment. Participants' characteristics were compared between two age groups: 40-49 years and \u2265 50 years using Chi-square tests for categorical variables and T-tests for continuous variables. RESULTS This analysis includes a total of 70 male with hemophilia, 64.3% aged \u226550 years, 75.7% with hemophilia A. Individuals \u2265 50 years had higher rates of being married or with a partner (71.11% vs. 56.0%, P=0.20), retired/not employed (66.7% vs. 28.0%, P=0.002), and having mild or moderate hemophilia (68.9% vs. 40.0%, P=0.02) than those 40-49 years old. Use of prophylaxis was similar among age groups in severe hemophilia but lower for older mild/moderate PWH. Among persons with mild/moderate hemophilia, those \u2265 50 years old reported a higher rate of joint pain (83.8% vs 70.0%, P=0.37) or range of motion limitation (73.3% vs, 60.0%, p=0.45) than the younger group, although the differences were not statistically significant. Compared to those 40-49 years old, individuals \u2265 50 years old reported fewer emergency room visits (4.6% vs. 20.8%, P=0.03), and physical therapy visits (16.0% vs. 41.7%, P=0.06). The older age group had significantly higher rates of self-reported myocardial infarction (11.6% vs. 0%, P=0.08) and diabetes (24.4% vs. 4.0%, P=0.03) than those 40-49 years. Self-reported comorbidities were measured by asking \"Has a doctor ever told you that you have certain conditions?\" The most frequently reported comorbidities were hepatitis C infection (75.7%, 79.3% of persons with infected hepatitis C had been treated and, 82.7% cleared the hepatitis C virus), hypertension (47.1%), depression (23.2%) and anxiety (21.7%). Mean covariates adjusted EQ-5D index score was lower in older persons (0.79 vs. 0.87, P=0.09). CONCLUSIONS Older PWH are over-represented by individuals with mild/moderate disease, potentially due to premature death among those with severe disease. Although this group included a larger proportion of mild disease than younger PWH, it presented prevalent comorbidities both of aging and of hemophilic arthropathy, despite lower rates of healthcare utilization and use of preventive therapies.
