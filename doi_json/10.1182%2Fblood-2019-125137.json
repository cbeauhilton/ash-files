    "abstract_text": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive cancer of aberrant B-lymphocytes. Although a portion of DLBCL is curable with standard immunochemotherapy, patients who fail this treatment have a poor prognosis. Recently, cancer genomics has paved the way for better understanding of the genetic basis of lymphoma pathogenesis. Characterization of point mutations and structural alterations has uncovered novel molecular targets for lymphoma therapy and provided a comprehensive view of lymphoma development. By performing multiplatform genomic analysis of DLBCL biopsy samples, we have identified KLHL14 as a recurrent target of somatic mutations in activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL biopsies (10.8% of patients). KLHL14 contains a BTB (broad complex, tramtrack, and bric a brac) domain that can potentially mediate dimerization and binding to Cullin3 (CUL3)-a essential scaffold component of the Cullin-RING-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. KLHL14 also contains kelch repeats that can form a B-propeller tertiary structure that can serve as a substrate-binding domain. KLHL14 is highly expressed in B-cells but is found at low levels in non-immune tissues. Deficiency of KLHL14 in mice leads to embryonic lethality while KLHL14 heterozygous mice show reduction of B-1a cells, suggesting a role for KLHL14 in B-cell homeostasis. Importantly, KLHL14 mutations are highly enriched in tumors belonging to the recently defined MCD (MYD88 L265P /CD79B mutation) genetic subtype of DLBCL, the subset of ABC DLBCLs. Somatic mutations primarily localize to the N-terminus of the protein in the BTB domain and BACK (BTB and C-terminal Kelch) domain. However, the impact of these mutations as well as the molecular function of KLHL14 is largely unknown. To investigate the biological effect of KLHL14 loss of function, we used an inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system to delete KLHL14 in ABC DLBCL cell lines and monitored cell growth. Ablation of KLHL14 resulted in an increase in cell proliferation and survival, supporting a role for KLHL14 as a tumor suppressor. Next, we performed a multiplatform -omic analysis (proteomics, phosphoproteomics, ubiquitinomics, high-throughput sequencing) to explore the signaling networks and interactome of KLHL14. Whereas ectopic expression of wild-type KLHL14 altered the dynamics of tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitylation events in ABC DLBCL lines, KLHL14 lymphoma-associated mutant alleles had little if any effect, suggesting that they are loss-of-function variants. Gene expression profiling by RNA-sequencing revealed that KLHL14-inactivated cells have a higher NF-kB target gene expression than wild-type cells. Thus, tumor-associated inactivating mutations of KLHL14 depend on a subset of essential NF-kB-related oncoproteins for their survival and this might contribute to the proliferative advantage of DLBCL. In summary, we have uncovered a tumor suppressive function of KLHL14 and found that KLHL14 mutants promote ABC DLBCL survival by increasing NF-kB activity. These findings suggest that tumors with KLHL14 inactivating mutations may serve as a marker of resistance to anti-NF-kB treatment and provide the basis for treating MCD subtype patients with downstream NF-kB pathway inhibitors in the clinical settings.
