    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4315 Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by thrombosis and/or pregnancy loss in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA). These antibodies are directed primarily against phospholipid-bound \u03b22-glycoprotein I (\u03b2 2 GPI). Anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies activate endothelial cells, enhancing the expression of adhesion molecules and tissue factor, and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Kru\u0308ppel-like factors (KLF) regulate endothelial cell inflammatory responses. KLF2 and KLF4 mediate anti-atherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory effects in endothelial cells, and we have hypothesized that alterations in the expression or activity of KLF2 or KLF4 may modulate the endothelial cell response to APLA. In preliminary studies, we have observed that endothelial cell activation induced by APLA/anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies inhibits the expression of KLF2 and KLF4, and as demonstrated by our laboratory and others, is accompanied by activation of NF-kB. However, forced expression of KLF2 or KLF4 by plasmid-mediated transfection of endothelial cells inhibits neither the phosphorylation of ser536 of the p65 subunit of NF-kB, nor the nuclear translocation of p65 in response to APLA/anti-\u03b2 2 GPI antibodies. Despite the lack of effect on forced KLF2 or KLF4 expression in endothelial cells on p65 phosphorylation, expression of either of these factors inhibits NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity with corresponding inhibition of cellular activation as measured by inhibition of cell-surface E-selectin expression as well as E-selectin promoter activity. Inhibition of NF-kB transcriptional activity by KLF2 and KLF4 appears to be due to recruitment of the CBP/p300 cofactor away from NF-kB by KLF2 or KLF4, since augmenting the cellular pool of CBP/p300 by transfection restores NF-\u03baB activity and endothelial cell activation responses. Similarly, treatment of APLA-activated endothelial cells with CBP/p300 siRNA inhibits NF-kB transcriptional activity regardless of the levels of KLF2 or KLF4. These data suggest that APLA inhibit KLF expression and that these changes promote the acquisition of a prothrombotic endothelial cell phenotype. CBP/p300 may serve as a molecular switch that determines the relative antithrombotic activities of KLFs versus the prothrombotic, inflammatory responses induced by NF-kB in APLA/anti-\u03b22GPI antibody activated endothelial cells.
