    "abstract_text": "DNA methylation is one of the major epigenetic mechanisms that controls cellular differentiation. The ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of methylcytosine dioxygenases mediates active DNA demethylation through the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and subsequent intermediates. Here we demonstrate that TET2 regulates CD8 + T cell differentiation in vivo following acute and chronic viral infection. At steady-state, mice with a T-cell specific deletion of TET2 have intact thymic and peripheral T cell populations. Following acute viral infection with LCMV-Armstrong, TET2 loss enhances LCMV-specific CD8 + T cell memory differentiation in a cell-intrinsic manner without disrupting antigen-specific cell expansion or cytokine production. However, TET2-deficient memory CD8 + T cells exhibit altered recall responses with blunted re-expansion, retained expression of phenotypic memory markers and restricted re-expression of activation markers. During chronic viral infection with LCMV-clone 13, TET2 controls CD8 + T cell expansion and alters differentiation. Importantly, though mice with T-cell specific loss of TET2 developed similar levels of CD8 + T cell exhaustion as wild-type mice, TET2 loss specifically reduced PD-1 expression suggesting that TET2 may direct DNA demethylation of the PD-1 locus. Together, our data indicate that TET2 is an important regulator of CD8 + T cells following both acute and chronic viral infections and suggest targeting epigenetic regulators have potential for enhancing antiviral immunity.
