    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4749 Background: That pediatric, adolescent and young adult cancers have become compatible with long term survivorship in the majority of cases has meant a growing emphasis on an understanding of the late effects of treatment. Among the barriers to successful health self-management in the context of transition of care from pediatricians to internists is the challenge of finding adult health care providers in the community who are comfortable caring for patients in this age group. We have developed a curriculum relating to different aspects of AYA survivorship for oncology and primary health care trainees who may come across AYA cancer survivors in the course of usual practice. Focus groups were used to refine the modules before the current application. Aim: To improve provider knowledge of AYA survivorship issues and management in a university setting. Methods: Using a combination of review articles, original research, and published guidelines for cancer survivorship, 8 teaching modules (power point presentations of 8\u201315 slides each) were developed: health care self-management; bone health; cardiac late effects; fertility late effects; neurocognitive late effects; psychosocial late effects; pulmonary late effects; and second malignancies. Modules were refined with the use of provider focus groups. These recently have been made available to trainees at UNC: (pediatrics [P], medicine-pediatrics [MP], medicine [M], medical hematology oncology [MHO], pediatric hematology oncology [PHO], and nurse practitioner students [NP]) in hard copy and on departmental websites. Computerized pre- and post-tests were developed for each module to assess content acquisition and will be required of the ~6 trainees/month rotating through the Survivors Clinics or on inpatient or outpatient services. At the end of each module, participants also are being asked, using a 3 point scale (agree [3], neutral [2], disagree [1]) if they feel the sessions gave them increased confidence in following AYA survivors. Participants also will be given the opportunity to critique the modules. Results: Preliminary results will not be available until December. However, enthusiasm among the target audience during the first 2 months of this program has been strong. Conclusion: Short teaching modules can be developed to engage trainees in AYA late effects issues. Ongoing work is being done to assess the effectiveness and usefulness of the modules for providers at UNC who care for adolescent and young adult cancer survivors. We anticipate that this approach will be expanded to our outreach practices. Parallel modules are in development for AYA survivors and their families. *With support from a 2009 ASH Alternative Training Pathway Grant, T. Shea, PI.
