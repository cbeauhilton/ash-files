    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3115 Background: The International Staging System (ISS), chromosomal abnormalities, and response to therapy are well recognized predictors of outcome in multiple myeloma (MM). However, the role of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a prognostic marker for MM is not well established. Recently we showed that high LDH at diagnosis of MM is a predictor of shorter survival. Here we report the impact of the LDH level at the time of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HCT) on its outcome. Methods: We evaluated 1,658 patients with symptomatic myeloma who underwent auto-HCT from July 1988 to December 2010 at our institution. The primary objective was to determine the impact of high LDH (>1000 IU/L) level, obtained on the start day of the preparative regimen, on progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Patient characteristics according to LDH level at auto-HCT are summarized in Table 1 . Patients in the 2 LDH groups (>1000 or \u2264 1000) were matched for age, gender, disease status, and response to prior therapy at the time of auto-HCT. Patients with LDH >1000 IU/L had a significantly higher beta-2 microglobulin (\u03b22m) and bone marrow plasmacytosis at the time of auto-HCT. Median times to neutrophil (10 vs. 10 days: p=0.10) and platelet engraftment (11.3 vs.12.2 days: p=0.20) were not different in the 2 groups. Also, there was no significant difference in CR, VGPR, PR or overall response rates between the 2 groups. Median follow up was 35 months (1 to 244). Median OS in patients with LDH >1000 and \u2264 1000 were 49.2 and 68.0 months, respectively (p=0.03). Median PFS in patients with LDH >1000 and \u2264 1000 were 14.4 and 24.7 months, respectively (p=0.001). On univariate analyses, >10% plasma cells in bone marrow biopsy, relapsed disease, serum \u03b22M \u2265 3.5 at auto-HCT, presence of any chromosomal abnormality, and < PR after auto-HCT were associated with significantly shorter PFS and OS. Conclusions: Having a serum LDH value of >1000 IU/L prior to auto-HCT is associated with shorter PFS and OS in patients with MM. These high risk patients may require aggressive post-transplant therapy, including consolidation, maintenance, tandem transplants or novel approaches like immunotherapy. Table 1.
