    "abstract_text": "Mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells for hematopoietic rescue following autologous transplantation is usually achieved with the chemokine G-CSF. Engraftment potential is increased when higher levels of the receptor CXCR4 are noted on the hematopoietic progenitor stem cells (HPCs). It was previously reported that intravenous treatment with fucoidan or dextran sulfate, which are sulfated high molecular weight compounds, increased numbers of circulating mature white blood cells and HPCs in mice and nonhuman primates. This treatment also led to an increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 levels in mice. In vitro treatment of bone marrow mononuclear cells with IFN-\u03b3 can up-regulate the expression of CXCR4 on granulocyte precursors and monocytes. We obtained ethics approval and informed consent to study the mobilization effect of orally ingested GFS TM (Galactofucan Sulfate), a seaweed-derived fucoidan, in healthy human volunteers in a single blinded placebo controlled phase I/II clinical study. Flow cytometry was used to monitor CXCR4 receptor on CD34+ stem cells. When moderate quantities (3 g/day) of seaweed containing 10% GFS TM were ingested, a slight increase in the total number of HPCs (CD34+) in the peripheral blood (PB) was observed, from 1.38 to 1.69 cells/\u03bcL ( p =0.22, n=6). In addition, there was a small increase in the percentage of HPCs that expressed CXCR4 surface receptor, from 0.59 to 1.47 cells/\u03bcL, which is equivalent to 43% to 63% ( p =0.19, n=6). Moreover, when 3 g/day of 75% GFS TM was ingested, a greater increase in the total number of HPCs (CD34+) in PB was observed, from 1.65 to 1.84 cells/\u03bcL ( p =0.04, n=23). Furthermore, the percentage of HPCs that expressed CXCR4 increased from 0.746\u20131.652 cells/\u03bcL, which is equivalent to 45% to 90% ( p =0.0002, n=23). Cytokine analysis, which was performed using ELISA to test for SDF-1 and IFN-\u03b3, showed a significant increase in the plasma level of these cytokines. SDF-1 level was elevated from 1979 to 2068 pg/mL ( p =0.051, n=10) and the level of IFN-\u03b3 from 9.04 to 9.90 pg/mL (p=0.007, n=10). These results suggest that GFS TM may modulate CXCR4 or disturb the SDF-1 gradient between bone marrow and PB. IFN-\u03b3 might play a role in the up-regulation of the expression of CXCR4 on CD34+ cells. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first report of mobilization of HPCs by disruption of CXCR4/SDF-1 interaction using oral fucoidan.",
