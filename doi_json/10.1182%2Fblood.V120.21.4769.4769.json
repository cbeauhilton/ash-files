Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for SCA. To analyze immunohematological reconstitution after transplant, we report our experience concerning 12 geno-identical HSCT for SCA-patients prepared with the same myeloablative conditioning regiment consisting of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide. Patients and Methods. Twelve patients with a median age of 12 years (range, 2\u201316), affected by sickle cell anemia (SCA), received hematopoietic stem cell transplantations from HLA-identical, related donors following a myeloablative conditioning regimen. To analyze the mechanisms involved in immunological reconstitution post transplant, we analyzed T cell subsets by flow cytometry at + 60 post transplant. Results. All patients had sustained engraftment and remained free of any SCA-related events after transplantation. Sixty days after the transplant, the patients had significantly lower CD4+ T cells in comparison to the controls (15.6 \u00b1 5.9 % vs . 47.5 \u00b1 6% respectively), whereas CD8+ T cells were the first lymphocytes to repopulate the peripheral blood with up to 45% of these cells being CD8+ T cells (in mean 48.5 \u00b1 14.3 % vs . 20 \u00b1 7%). All patients displayed reduced numbers of B cells versus normal value, and 10/12 patients had only 0% to 1% of control levels of CD19+ cells. CD3-CD56+ bright NK cells were 18.6 \u00b1 12.2 %, whereas CD3-CD16+ (with cytotoxic functions) were 16.7 \u00b1 11.8 %. Conclusion. Our primary finding include the following: 1) rapid increase of lymphocytes in peripheral blood after transplant; 2) rapid expansion of CD8+ T cell but not CD4 T cell counts. Probably reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, observed in 11/12 patients on the early stages of T-lymphocyte recovery after transplant, might induce a dramatic increase in CD8 but not in CD4 T-cell counts.
