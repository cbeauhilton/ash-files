    "abstract_text": "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a life-threatening disease in which IgG antibodies against the heparin-PF4 complex activate platelets via Fc\u03b3RIIA. We previously reported that TULA-2 serves as a negative regulator of Fc\u03b3RIIA pathway by dephosphorylating Syk in HEL cells. To further investigate the effect of TULA-2 on the Fc\u03b3RIIA pathway and HIT, we crossed TULA-2 -/- with Fc\u03b3RIIA +/+ mice. Ablation of TULA-2 resulted in hyperphosphorylation of Syk, LAT, and PLC\u03b32 in platelets after Fc\u03b3RIIA activation. Integrin activation, calcium mobilization, and P-selectin exposure were also enhanced in TULA-2 -/- murine platelets compared to TULA-2 +/+ . Further, anti-GPIX antibody-induced HIT-like thrombocytopenia and thrombin generation were also augmented in TULA-2 -/- mice (Figure A). We also found that decreased TULA-2 level shortened tail-bleeding time in mice (Figure B), suggesting a role of TULA-2 in physiological hemostasis. Additionally, TULA-2 KO and WT platelets did not show significant differences in platelet spreading and clot retraction, indicating that outside-in signaling is not affected by the absence of TULA-2. At the protein level, TULA-2 heterozygous knockout (TULA-2 +/- ) platelets express 50% as much protein as their wildtype counterparts. Interestingly, TULA-2 +/- mice showed significantly increased platelet reactivity and more severe thrombocytopenia in vivo compared with TULA-2 +/+ mice. Together the data indicate that not only the absence of TULA-2, but also the relative level of TULA-2 expression modulate Fc\u03b3RIIA-mediated platelet reactivity, HIT pathogenesis, and hemostasis. Considering that TULA-2 is also a key regulator in platelet GPVI pathway, measuring TULA-2 expression may be a valuable predictor for HIT susceptibility and platelet reactivity in general. Figure.
