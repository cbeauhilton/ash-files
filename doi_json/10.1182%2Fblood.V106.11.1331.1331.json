    "abstract_text": "The potential cardiotoxicity of chemotherapic drugs is well known. For example anthracycline-based regimens are extremely effective for various hematological malignancies. The main disadvantage is cardiotoxicity particularly, in elderly patients who are frequently treated with a consequent dose reduction. The diagnosis and prognosis in patients with suspected heart failure needs a specific monitoring by echocardiography during and after chemotherapy regimens. We tested the interest of NT-proBNP as alternative marker for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction. Brain or B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal fragment of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are considered to be valuable biomarkers for the detection of disease state in patients with suspected heart failure. Methods During 1 year, blood samples of 31 patients with hematological malignancies, treated with usual chemotherapy were selected on a routine basis. Patients had the diagnosis of acute leukemia (AL), B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), multiple myeloma (MM) and non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Venous blood was drawn in the early morning and centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 minutes. The obtained clear plasma fraction was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until the assay. All plasma samples were analyzed for NT-proBNP using an electro chemiluminescence immuno assay (proBNP kit Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) on Elecsys 2010 analyser. All assays were performed blind to clinical informations on the patients. Results The mean age of the patients was 72 (range: 36\u201388). There were 15 men (48 %) and 16 women (52 %). Five patients were smokers (16 %) and 7 (22.6%) had cardiovascular diseases (4 hypertension, 2 heart failure, 1 pace maker). Only 3 patients had a subnormal renal function. There were 6 patients with AL, 6 with B-CLL, 11 with MM and 8 with NHL. The administered medications were divided in 3 cardio-toxicity stages: 10 (32.25 %) patients received stage 3 cardiotoxicity regimens, 10 (32.25 %) stage 2 and 11 (35.5 %) stage 1. Fourteen patients (45 %) died in relation with hematological malignancies and none in relation with heart failure. But treatment regimens have been reduced, discontinued, modified or stopped in 7 patients after heart failure diagnosis with echocardiography. All these patients received stage 2 or 3 cardiotoxicity chemotherapy regimens and 4 had prior cardiovascular diseases. The mean age was 74 (range: 66\u201382). Only one patient is alive in this subgroup. Considering the age and the heart state of our 31 patients, chemotherapeutic treatments need or not to be adjust. The cardiac risk at diagnosis was assessed by left-ventricular ejection fraction (VEF) measurement. We shows that NT-proBNP brings reliable results to assess that risk, with a positive correlation to the VEF.
