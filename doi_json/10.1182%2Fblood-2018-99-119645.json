    "abstract_text": "Human LAMTOR2 deficiency is characterized by severe congenital neutropenia, growth failure, partial albinism, as well as B and T cell deficiencies (Bohn et al., Nat Med 2007). To determine the role of the endosomal adaptor LAMTOR2 in T cell development and homeostasis we used conditional knockout mouse models. Mx1-Cre -driven knockout of Lamtor2 resulted in reduction of thymus weight and total thymocyte numbers. Immunophenotyping revealed an impaired T cell development characterized by a partial block at the double negative CD4 - CD8 - T cell precursor stage after 7 and 21 days of poly I:C injection that induced deletion of the Lamtor2 gene. Since Mx1-Cre-driven knockout does not allow a discrimination between T cell intrinsic and extrinsic effects, we next generated pre-TCR \u03b1 -iCre conditional knockout mice. In contrast to Mx1-Cre-Lamtor2 fl/fl mice, mice with T cell-specific knockout of Lamtor2 showed normal frequencies of total thymocytes and T cell progenitor subsets. Furthermore, LAMTOR2-deficient thymocytes exhibited normal TCR signaling (p-ERK, p-LAT, p-LCK, p-PLC\u03b3, Nur77 ) and internalization of TCR\u03b2 upon stimulation with anti-CD3\u03b5 +/- anti-CD28, indicating that LAMTOR2 in T cells is dispensable for thymocyte development. To assess whether T cell developmental defects in Mx1-Cre-Lamtor2 fl/fl mice are caused by a dysfunctional thymic epithelium, we analyzed thymic epithelial cells (TECs) after 4 days of poly I:C injection by flow cytometry and detected a reduced ratio of CD45 - EpCAM + UEA-1 + Ly51 - medullary TECs (mTECs) to CD45 - EpCAM + UEA-1 - Ly51 + cortical TECs in LAMTOR2-deficient mice. Further studies are underway to determine the role of LAMTOR2 in mTECs. Taken together, our findings show that LAMTOR2 is not required for TCR-mediated signaling but plays a critical role in controlling mTEC homeostasis.
