    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4781 Background Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) responds only transiently to conventional chemotherapy resulting in a dismal long-term prognosis. At a molecular level it is characterised by the chromosomal translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32), which leads to constitutive over-expression of the cell cycle regulatory protein cyclin D1. GA101 is a third generation, glycoengineered type II IgG1 anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody with superior direct cell death induction by targeting a type II epitope and enhanced antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). High efficacy in lymphoma cell lines has led to combination experiments with various chemotherapeutic compounds or the CDK-inhibitor Flavopiridol. Methods Using a MCL cell line panel (Granta-519, HBL-2, Jeko-1, Rec-1 and Z-138) and a Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma cell line (Karpas-422) we determined the effect of GA101 (1 \u03bcg/ml) monotherapy as well as in combination with Fludarabine (0,25 \u03bcg/ml), Bendamustine (5 \u03bcg/ml), Mitoxantrone (0,25 and 0,5 \u03bcg/ml) and Flavopiridol (100nM) on cell proliferation and viability. Trypan-blue exclusion tests were used to analyze cell viability at 0h, 24h, 48h and 72h. The panel of MCL cell lines was treated to determine potential synergism of agent combinations. Accordingly, fractional product was calculated: synergism > 0,1; additive effect -0,1<x<0,1; antagonism < -0,1. Results After mono-exposure with GA101 (1 \u03bcg/ml), Granta-519 and Rec-1 showed the highest sensitivity (Granta: 65-75% cell reduction, Rec-1: 30-45%). Intermediate results were achieved for HBL-2 (20-30%), Z-138 and Karpas-422 (10-15%), Jeko-1 (5%). Fludarabine alone resulted in a 20-40% cell reduction. Bendamustine showed a higher efficacy in Jeko-1, Rec-1 and Z-138 (40-90%) than in Granta-519, Karpas-422 and HBL-2 (10%). Mitoxantrone treatment demonstrated a high impact on all cell lines (80-95% cell reduction). Flavopiridol induced a 65-85% cell reduction in Jeko-1, Rec-1 and Karpas-422in comparison to 30-45% in Granta-519, HBL-2 and Z-138. Additional experiments showed additive effects of all GA101 combinations resulting in 40-80% cell reduction (Fludarabine), 30-90% (Bendamustine), 85-95% (Mitoxantrone) and 60-80% (Flavopiridol). Conclusions These in vitro results demonstrate that the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody GA101 alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutical compounds or the CDK-inhibitor (Flavopiridol) show a promising efficacy in MCL cell lines (additive in combination), supporting the clinical evaluation of such an innovative immuno-chemotherapy in mantle cell lymphoma.
