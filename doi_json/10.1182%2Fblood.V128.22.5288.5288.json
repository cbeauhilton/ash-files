    "abstract_text": "Background: B-cell development is a complex biological process that initiates in bone marrow and matures in lymph nodes. These hierarchical stages are tightly regulated by transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNAs). B-cells are prone to genetic alteration during these maturation stages due to DNA breaks required for B-cell receptor re-arrangement and additional changes that occur during the germinal center (GC)-reaction for class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. The unwarranted genomic changes resulting from these processes can lead to B-cell malignancies with varied clinical and pathological characteristics. Of the lymphoma subtypes derived from mature B-cells, a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal large cell lymphoma (PMBL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) are putatively derived from GC B-cells, with varied morphological, pathological and clinical characteristics. These tumor are characterized by distinct genetic abnormalities,[ t(14;18) in GCB-DLCBL, and FL or t(8;14)] in BL, and mutational profile. We postulate miRNA expression signatures, may also explain the wide-ranging clinico-pathological characteristics of these GC B- cell derived tumors. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of miRNA profiles of DLBCL, BL, PBML, FL and EBV+DLBCL performed by us or others. (Iqbal 2015; 2012; Leich 2011; Andrade 2014). We also included lymphomas derived from na\u00efve B-cells (MCL, SLL) and post GC B-cells (activated B cells like ABC-DLBCL), EBV (+) DLBCL, normal B-cell subsets and cell lines of distinct B-cell lineages. The majority of the cases have been characterized by gene expression profiling (GEP) with corresponding pathological clinical characteristics in above studies. The data was obtained using Taqman\u00ae human microRNA array (Applied Biosystems, CA) containing 380 miRNAs and analyzed using BRB-array Tools. Results In our initial miRNA expression profile of 249 lymphomas including GCB-DLBCL (n=34), ABC-DLBCL(n= 29), PMBL(n= 9), BL(n= 33), FL (n= 32), EBV+DLBCL (n=8); MCL(n=30) and SLL(n=12)showed distinct hierarchical clusters enriched with GEP defined subgroup, with few interspersed cases from other subgroups suggesting that miRNAs can complement and delineate GEP defined molecular subgroups, an observation consistent with earlier findings (Iqbal 2015). When we examined miRNAs, that are specifically associated with GC B- derived lymphomas, we observed a subset of miRNA including miR-146a, miR-142-3p, miR-17, miR19b, and miR106a were present at higher levels (top 5% in abundance by C T values) in GC B lymphomas. Of these, somatic mutations in miR142 have been recently reported in GC derived lymphomas (Alyssa, Leukemia 2016). These miRNAs also represented the most abundant miRNAs in centroblast, suggesting lineage specificity of miRNA signature in these lymphomas. However, miR222 highly expressed in centroblast was not expressed at higher levels in GCB-DLBCL and BL. A number of miRNAs specifically abundant in distinct lymphomas included (BL: miR-20a, miR-16), (GCB-DLBCL: miR-223, miR-24) and (FL: miR222). MiR-150 was highly expressed in NHLs putatively derived from naive B-cells like MCL or SLL, but absent from GC-derived NHLs. Consistent with this, miR-150 was present in naive B-cells, but not in centroblast, suggesting that miR-150 may have discrete function during early B-cell differentiation and late maturation stages. Within GC derived lymphoma, we examined miRNA profiles in clinically aggressive (BL); indolent lymphomas (FL) and intermediate aggressive (GCB-DLBCL) and their association with normal B-cell subsets, and indeed a number of miRNAs (ex. miR-150) were associated with indolent lymphomas, whereas a subset of miRNAs was present in aggressive lymphomas (ex. miR-16), suggesting these miRNAs may contribute the distinct clinical characteristics. Though we have identified unique miRNA profiles in these GC derived NHLs, the target genes of these miRNAs remains to be identified. Conclusion: We identified microRNAs that were differentially expressed between GC-derived DLBCL and other lymphomas, which may help explain distinguishing features of these lymphomas.
