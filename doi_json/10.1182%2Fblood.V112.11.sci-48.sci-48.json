    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a complex hemoglobinopathy characterized by microvascular occlusion and hemolytic anemia. Patients suffer from a myriad of both acute and chronic problems affecting virtually every organ system. Historically, microvascular occlusion has been the focus of scientific investigations into these manifestations and the chronic hemolysis of SCD was overlooked. More recently, however, the importance of the pathophysiology of hemolysis has been appreciated and related to a subset of the clinical manifestations of SCD, including pulmonary hypertension, priapism, skin ulcers, and possibly stroke. This subphenotype of SCD has been convincingly related to impaired nitric oxide (NO) homeostasis due to hemolysis. NO has pleiotropic effects including vaso-dilatory, antioxidative, anti-adhesion, and anti-thrombotic properties, which are all potentially important in the pathophysiology of SCD. Perturbation of NO homeostasis, therefore, could profoundly impact patients with SCD. Animal and human data support a state of \u201cNO resistance\u201d in SCD patients. Human studies have shown that SCD patients have a decreased response to exogenous NO donors and that is likely due to the scavenging of NO by free plasma hemoglobin that results from ongoing hemolysis. \u201cNO resistance\u201d is further augmented by the increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) known to occur in SCD patients. High levels of ROS favor additional hemolysis through increased oxidant stress on the sickle red blood cell and reduce NO bioavailability by inactivation of circulating NO. With the substantial human and animal data to support a role for \u201cNO resistance\u201d in the pathophysiology of SCD, investigation with NO-based therapy have begun. Several approaches to overcoming \u201cNO resistance\u201d can be devised including increasing the precursors to NO, decreasing hemolysis, direct NO donors, and decreasing oxidant stress. To date, studies evaluating arginine (NO precursor), inhaled NO, and sildenafil (NO donor) have been reported. Oral arginine showed no benefit in a large clinical trial, and a preliminary trial of inhaled NO had only minimal benefit. Sildenafil may be more promising and is under further study. Lastly, although impaired NO bioavailability has been related to a subset of patients with pulmonary hypertension, skin ulcers and priapism, it will be important to determine what impact NO has on other manifestations, such as vaso-occlusive pain episodes and whether NO modulation can also be used therapeutically in this setting."
