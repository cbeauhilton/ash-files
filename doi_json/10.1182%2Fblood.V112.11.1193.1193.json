    "abstract_text": "Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses have revealed uniparental disomy (UPD) to be a common event in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) occurring in approximately 20% of cases. Acquired UPD results in copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Comparing matched tumor and germline DNA samples recurrent acquired UPDs affecting chromosomes 11p and 13q were identified. As DNA microarray-based gene expression profiling (GEP) has recently been shown to powerfully capture the molecular heterogeneity of leukemia, we sought to identify gene expression patterns associated with recurrent UPD in CN-AML. We profiled a set of clinically annotated CN-AML specimens (n=66) entered on a multicenter trial for patients <60 years (AMLSG 07-04) which had been characterized by either 50k or 500k Affymetrix SNP microarrays. All cases were analyzed using Affymetrix microarrays (Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays). In this data set we investigated 12 UPDs (affecting chromosomes 1p, 2p, 6p, 11p, 13q and 19q) and applied supervised analyses to define gene-expression patterns associated with UPDs on chromosome 11p and 13q. For the case with an acquired UPD on 19q a gene dosage effect could be demonstrated. Genes located in the 36 Mb large UPD region showed a significantly lower average expression (p<0.001; t-test). Similarly, we observed a gene dosage effect in one of the UPDs observed on chromosome 1 (p=0.0097; t-test), whereas for the other UPDs no significant association between LOH and gene expression levels could be identified. Despite small sample numbers supervised analyses revealed a biologically meaningful gene expression signatures associated with acquired UPD 11p and 13q. In accordance with the association of UPD 13q with FLT3 -ITD, the UPD13q gene expression signature was enriched for genes associated with FLT3 -ITD. The UPD11p expression pattern was characterized by genes found to be down-regulated in CEBPA mut CN-AML cases, such as down-regulation of homeobox genes HOXA9 , HOXA10 , HOXB2 , and MEIS1 . Notably, the UPD11p signature was also characterized by the expression of e.g. UGT2B28 , P2RX5 , PGDS , CAPN1 , NDFIP1 , and TRIB2 , an expression profile that has been shown to be associated with CEBPA mut CN-AML as well as AML cases with epigenetic CEBPA silencing. Thus, our findings represent a starting point to further dissect CN-AML characterized by recurrent UPD, and ongoing analyses will provide additional insights into leukemia biology."
