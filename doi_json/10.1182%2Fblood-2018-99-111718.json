    "abstract_text": "Hemophilia B (HB) is a prime model for gene therapy. While data from current clinical trials using AAV-mediated liver-targeted FIX gene therapy are very encouraging, this protocol can only be applied to adults without liver disease or anti-AAV antibodies. Thus, developing another gene therapy protocol is desired. Our previous studies have demonstrated that platelet-targeted FIX expression driven by the platelet-specific \u03b1IIb promoter (2bF9) restores hemostasis and induces immune tolerance in HB mice (Chen et al. Mol Ther 2014). To improve the efficacy, we used a codon-optimized hyperfunctional FIX Padua (2bCoF9R338L) to replace the normal FIX expression cassette. We showed a 5.8-fold higher platelet-FIX antigen (plt-F9:Ag) and a 28-fold activity (plt-F9:C) levels in HB mice (the non-inhibitor model), respectively, in the 2bCoF9R338L group compared to the 2bF9 group. Here we evaluate 2bCoF9R338L gene therapy in HB mice with preexisting anti-F9 immunity (the inhibitor model). Both donor and recipient HB mice were immunized with rhF9 in the presence of Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant to induce inhibitor development. Plt-F9 expression was introduced by 2bCoF9R338L lentivirus transduction of Sca-1 + cells followed by syngeneic transplantation into primed recipients preconditioned with either a lethal 11Gy or a sub-lethal 6.6Gy total body irradiation. Animals were analyzed starting at 4 weeks after transplantation. FACS analysis showed that there was 21.4 \u00b1 11.4% (n = 6) transduced platelets in the 11Gy group, which was not significantly different compared to the 6.6Gy group (12.5 \u00b1 10.9%, n = 7) or the 6.6Gy non-inhibitor model (17.7 \u00b1 11.7%, n = 4). Plt-F9:C levels in the 11Gy and 6.6Gy groups were 18.68 \u00b1 8.61 and 9.17 \u00b1 12.22 mU/10 8 platelets, respectively. Plt-F9:Ag levels in the two groups were 3.96 \u00b1 1.57 and 1.70 \u00b1 1.64 mU/10 8 platelets, respectively, which were not significantly different compared to that obtained in the non-inhibitor model. To determine if plt-F9 is \u03b3-carboxylated, BaSO 4 precipitation was performed on platelet lysates from 2bCoR338L-transduced recipients. Diluted platelet lysate samples were treated with or without BaSO 4 , and the remaining unprecipitated FIX (meaning un-\u03b3-carboxylated) in supernatants was determined by FIX ELISA. No F9:Ag remained in the supernatants of BaSO 4 -treated platelet lysates, suggesting that FIX can fully undergo functional \u03b3-carboxylation in platelets. Of note, no anaphylaxis occurred in primed HB mice after platelet gene therapy. The inhibitor titers declined to undetectable with time in recipients after treatment with a half-life ( t 1/2 ) of inhibitor reduction in the 11Gy group of 49.2 \u00b1 3.9 days, which was significantly shorter than in the 6.6Gy group (82.6 \u00b1 32.6 days) and in the untransduced 6.6Gy control group (77.7 \u00b1 8.7 days), indicating that plt-F9 does not trigger a memory immune response in primed F9 null mice. Since our previous studies have shown that the clinical efficacy of plt-F9 is limited in the presence of anti-F9 inhibitors (Zhang et al. Blood 2010 ), we did not assess the bleeding phenotype in recipients until inhibitor titers dropped to an undetectable level. When a 6-hour tail bleeding test was used to assess the clinical efficacy of 2bCoF9R338L gene therapy, the bleeding time in the 11Gy and 6.6Gy groups was 2.5 \u00b1 1.3 and 2.5 \u00b1 1.1 hours, respectively, which was similar to that obtained in the wild-type (WT) control (1.7 \u00b1 0.9 hours). In contrast, none of the F9 null mice clotted within 6 hours. The remaining hemoglobin levels after the test were 79.5 \u00b1 15.5% and 64.7 \u00b123.4% in the 11Gy and 6.6Gy groups, respectively, which were not significantly different compared to the WT group (70.6 \u00b1 13.9%), but significantly higher than in the F9 null control (38.8 \u00b1 6.7%). We used ROTEM to analyze the whole blood clotting time (WBCT). WBCT in the 2bCoF9R338L-transduced group was significantly shorter than in the F9 null control group (1328 \u00b1 236 vs. 2426 \u00b1 476 sec, respectively), confirming that hemostasis was improved in 2bCoF9R338L transduced recipients. Together, our data demonstrated that 2bCoF9R338L gene therapy could efficiently introduce sustained levels of plt-F9 in HB mice even with pre-existing immunity, resulting in antibody eradication and phenotypic correction when inhibitors diminished, suggesting that 2bCoF9R338L gene therapy can be a promising protocol for all HB patients, including patients with inhibitors.
