    "abstract_text": "The FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a class III receptor tyrosine kinase involved in hematopoietic progenitor cell development. Mutations of FLT3 have been reported in about a third of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The presence of FLT3 mutations confers a poor prognosis, and thus recent studies are directed at developing and testing novel FLT3 inhibitors for the treatment of AML. Go6976 is an indolocarbazole with a simillar structural backbone to staurosporine. In the present study, we demonstrated that Go6976 displays a potent inhibitory activity against recombinant FLT3 using in vitro kinase assay. Its IC50 value is 0.7nM. We also tested the effect of Go6976 on several kinds of other kinases. Go6976 inhibited the kinase activity of Aurora-A, Aurora-B and JAK2 with IC50 values of 118.2 nM, 77.7 nM and 92.7 nM, respectively. Go6976 did not show the inhibitory activity against the FGFR3 even at 1 microM. These data indicated Go6976 preferentially and potently inhibit the FLT3. Go6976 significantly inhibited the proliferation of human leukemia cells having FLT3-ITD. The IC50 values of Go6976 against MV4-11 and MOLM-13 were 0.044 and 0.008 microM, respectively. In contrast, human leukemia HL-60 and U937 cells which lack FLT3-ITD showed strong resistance to Go6976 treatment. Furthermore, we observed that Go6976 shows minimal toxicity for purified human normal CD34(+) cells. Go6976 suppressed the phosphorylation of FLT3 in MV4-11 and MOLM13 cells. Consistent with FLT3 inhibition, Go6976 potently inhibited phosphorylation of constitutively activated STAT3/5, Erk1/2, and Akt. Western blotting analysis revealed that MV4-11 and MOLM13 cells possess abundant survivin and Mcl-1 protein. We hypothesized that the expression of survivin and Mcl-1 may be regulated by constitutive activation of FLT3. In order to test this hypothesis, the effect of siRNA for FLT3-ITD was examined. Indeed, we observed that siRNA-induced down-regulation of FLT3 decreased survivin and Mcl-1 expression in MOLM13 cells, suggesting that up-regulated survivin and Mcl-1 may be closely associated with FLT3 signaling. Interestingly, we found that both survivin mRNA and protein were rapidly downregulated by Go6976 treatment in MOLM13 and MV4-11 cells. It was also observed that Go6976 significantly suppressed Mcl-1 mRNA and protein. It has been reported that STAT-3 and STAT-5 signaling play a pivotal role in the regulation of survivin and Mcl-1, respectively. Thus, inhibitory effects of Go6976 on the expression Survivin and Mcl-1 may be a consequence of the suppression of phosphorylation of STAT-3 and STAT-5 by Go6976 in FLT3-ITD cells. This inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins by Go6976 may be critical for its antiproliferative effect in FLT3-ITD cells. It has been known that previous FLT3 inhibitors such as PKC412 and CEP-701 bind to the human plasma protein, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, resulting in significantly diminished inhibitory activity against FLT3. Indeed, inhibitory effect of PKC412 on FLT3 was significantly decreased, when MOLM13 cells were treated with PKC412 in the presence of human serum. In contrast, we found that Go6976 potently inhibits phosphorylation of FLT3 and exerts cytotoxicity even in the presence of human serum or human alpha1-acid glycoprotein. In conclusion, our data indicate that Go6976 may have a unique therapeutic potential for FLT3-driven acute myeloid leukemia. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
