    "abstract_text": "The leukocyte surface antigen CD37 (TSPAN26), a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, is widely expressed on most malignant B cells, making it an actionable target for treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) indications. Accordingly, \u03b1CD37 antibodies have shown promising results in phase 1/2 clinical trials for CLL and NHL. Richter's syndrome (RS) is the transformation of CLL into an aggressive and rapidly fatal lymphoma, typically a diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). RS is a challenging disease since very few effective treatment options exist for these patients and the available regimens, mainly based on R-CHOP scheme, show limited efficacy. We recently established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from RS patients and have shown that they can be used to test the efficacy of novel drugs and drug combinations 1,2 . All available RS-PDX models were characterized by high-levels of CD37 expression, when assessed by RNA sequencing, reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), flow cytometry (FACS), western blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). More precisely, two models (RS1316 and IP867/17) showed slightly higher CD37 levels compared to the others (RS9737 and RS1050). These models were used to test three different \u03b1CD37-ATACs\u00ae, ADCs which comprise amanitin-derivatives as payload. Amanitin (the main poison in the green deathcap mushroom) belongs to the well-known amatoxin family. Amanitin is taken up by OATP1B3 transporter, solely expressed on hepatocytes. Upon mushroom intoxication, it can lead to severe liver toxicity by inhibiting the RNA polymerase II. Upon conjugation to target-specific antibodies, the maximal tolerated dose is significantly increased by reducing the non-specific liver uptake. By binding to its antigen, ATACs deliver amanitin only into target-positive cancer cells while target negative cells show no off-target toxicity. Consistent with CD37 expression on the cell surface, ex-vivo treatment of freshly purified cells from RS-PDX tumor masses to \u03b1CD37-ATACs\u00ae resulted in increased apoptosis after 72 hours of treatment, with only minor differences among the 3 ATACs\u00ae and the models used. Since alpha-amanitin is a deadly toxin known to target human RNA polymerase II and, at high doses, also RNA polymerase III, we checked messenger RNA levels in basal conditions and after CD37-ATAC\u00ae treatment by looking at different housekeeping genes, and confirmed a reduction in global mRNA levels. \u03b1CD37-ATAC\u00ae efficacy was then assessed in vivo in systemic RS-PDX models where RS cells are intra-venously (i.v.) injected in the tail vein and cells distribute to different tissues (blood, spleen and bone marrow), resembling the human disease. Cells from RS1316, RS1050 and RS9737 models were injected into the tail vein and left to engraft 14 days, before mice were randomly assigned to vehicle or ATAC\u00ae groups. A single i.v. treatment for each \u03b1CD37-ATAC\u00ae was administered, testing two different doses for each compound, and mice were then monitored for survival. Overall, the single administration of all three ATACs\u00ae caused highly significant disease regression. In the RS1316 model, independently of the dose or tested ATAC\u00aes, all treated mice, except one, were alive and disease-free until the end of the experiment, 140 days post cells injection, while survival of vehicle-treated mice was 65 days. FACS analysis to trace neoplastic cells in parenchymatous organs and bone marrow confirmed the absence of neoplastic cells. In the other 2 models, RS9737 and RS1050, even though ATAC\u00ae treatment did not result in complete disease eradication, a single administration of \u03b1CD37-ATAC\u00ae resulted in a dramatically increased survival (approximately 35-60 days, depending on the model and ATAC\u00ae used). Finally, CD37 expression was confirmed by RNA sequencing on a cohort of 15 primary RS samples, even though with variable levels. Compared to CLL cells, RS samples showed CD37 expression levels comparable to those reported for DLBCL cells. Overall, these data indicate CD37 as a potential target to treat RS patients with selective targeting \u03b1CD37-ATACs\u00ae.
