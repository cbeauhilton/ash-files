    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4822 Background: Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder of hemoglobin synthesis. This is due to replacement of Valine for Glutamic Acid in position six of the Beta globin chain of hemoglobin. This genetic alteration yields unstable RBC which lasts for 10\u201320 days. In stressful conditions the cells become sickle shaped and get lysed. There are about 20 million people with sickle cell disease in India. During January 2009- May2010 camps were held in various parts of West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh. Along with various mutations of thalassemia, we also observed sickle cell anemia among them. This triggered our interest to study the spectrum of the sickle mutation co-inheritant with different mutations such as Homozygous Sickle Cell, Sickle Cell-Beta 0 Thalassemia, Sickle Cell-Beta+ Thalassemia, Severe \u03b2 + thalassemia genes, Moderate \u03b2 + thalassemia genes, Mild \u03b2 + thalassemia genes Sickle cell-HbE Thalassaemia, Sickle cell-HPFH Thalassaemia, in said part of India. Since Indian patients with SS disease had higher hemoglobin, red cell counts and higher HbF levels and lower HbA2, MCHC, MCV, and reticulocyte counts, hence a high hemoglobin is a risk factor for painful crises and may also be a risk factor for avascular necrosis of the femoral head, proliferative sickle retinopathy, and acute chest syndrome. Methods: We have screened 332 individuals in eastern part of India during the period January 2009- May 2010. 3ml of peripheral blood was collected in EDTA vial from each individual. NESTROFT (Naked Eye Single Tube Red Cell Osmotic Fragility Test) was performed on spot. Then Complete Blood Count was done within 24 hours of collection. HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) was performed to identify the samples for confirmation. In our observation in case of sickle cell anaemia HbF (Fetal haemoglobin), Hb (haemoglobin), MCV (mean corpuscular volume) values ranges between 0\u201310 %, \u22647-10g/dl, 65\u201390fl respectively. ARMS (Amplification Refractory Mutation System) PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was done to confirm the mutation. Result:  Location . Total no. of Individual . Number of carrier with mutation . Number of patient with mutation . Jharkand 103 29 17 Chattisgarh 115 27 9 West Bengal 114 31 7 Location . Total no. of Individual . Number of carrier with mutation . Number of patient with mutation . Jharkand 103 29 17 Chattisgarh 115 27 9 West Bengal 114 31 7 View Large Conclusion: Of the total samples collected in the camps held at various places of Jharkand, Chattisgarh & West Bengal 87 of them was carriers of sickle cell anemia. There was 7 homozygous (SS), 14 sickle beta, 12 double heterozygous for HPFH (High Persistance of Fetal Hemoglobin) & sickle cell anemia. In conclusion, the manifestations of sickle cell disease are influenced by a variety of other genetic and environmental factors. The occurrence of the disease against different genetic and environmental backgrounds provides experimental models that contribute to understanding the variability in clinical and hematological expression of the disease.
