    "abstract_text": "Objectives: The goal of this study was to investigate the association of natural killer (NK) cell recovery with clinical outcomes after unmanipulated haploidentical blood and marrow transplantation. Methods: We sequentially monitored the reconstitution kinetics of circulating NK cells, CD56 bright and CD56 dim , in 43 patients by flow cytometry, and the functionality recovery of cytokine or cytotoxicity of NK cells by flow cytometry or LDH release assay after transplantation. Results: Reconstitution of NK cells was rapid but accompanied by skewing of cell subsets mainly in CD56 bright , which had a greater growing speed. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that dose of CD34+ cells in the allografts was inversely correlated with the ratio of T/NK cells (\u03b2=\u22120.506, P =0.003) and CD56 dim /CD56 bright cell (\u03b2=\u22120.403, P =0.018) by day 14 after HSCT, and dose of CD3+ T cells in the allografts was also inversely correlated with the ratio CD56 dim /CD56 bright cells by day 14 after HSCT (\u03b2=\u22120.474, P =0.005). Compared with non-acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) patients, patients with aGVHD had a higher level of NK subsets during week 2 post-transplantation. Cox regression analysis revealed that the patients with more CD56 bright NK cells in the recovery stage had a higher survival rate (hazard risk [HR], 0.353; p=0.019) and the patients with higher ratio of T/NK (>1.0) had a higher chance of getting aGVHD (HR, 3.889; p=0.034) and cGVHD (HR, 3.925; p=0.028). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the recovery of NK cells is and can be used as an indicator to predicate the clinical outcomes after unmanipulated haploidentical transplantation. Figure 1.
