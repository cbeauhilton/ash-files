    "abstract_text": "Objects: To explore the state of of intracellular signal pathway of mTOR/S6 in FAB low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia (RA)/RA with ringed sideroblasts (RAS). Methods: Samples were collected from 18 MDS-RA/RAS patients. The intracellular percentages of p-mTOR, p-S6 and IFN-\u03b3 of CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 + and CD3 + CD8 \u2212 T cells in bone marrow were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). 10 iron deficiency anemia (IDA) patients [male: 3, female: 7, media age: 44 years (from 31 to 72 years)] were determined as case controls and normal controls respectively. Results In normal controls, measurement of p-mTOR, p-S6 and IFN-\u03b3 in CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 \u2212 and CD3 + CD8 + T cells were (1.54\u00b11.51)%, (1.94\u00b11.08)%, (2.04\u00b12.03)%; (0.83\u00b10.82)%, (0.91\u00b10.88)%, (0.95\u00b10.93)%; (4.42\u00b13.55)%, (2.35\u00b11.69)%, (4.73\u00b14.43)%, respectively. By 2.62%) of normal controls, MDS group could be divided into two subgroups: MDS-1 with a higher CD3 + p-mTOR + expression, and MDS-2 with a lower expression. In MDS-1, percentages of p-mTOR, p-S6 and IFN-\u03b3 in CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 \u2212 and CD3 + CD8 + T cells were (20.70\u00b118.02)%, (22.94\u00b119.70)%, (26.03\u00b122.91)%; (2.85\u00b12.36)%, (3.36\u00b12.84)%, (4.91\u00b13.88)%; (13.92\u00b112.87)%, (10.05\u00b19.77)%, (16.38\u00b115.49)%; which were higher than normal controls ( P<0.05 ). In MDS-2, the percentages of CD3 + p-mTOR + [ (0.28\u00b10.28)% ], CD3 + CD8 \u2212 p-mTOR + [ ( 0.46\u00b10.41 )% ], CD3 + CD8 + p-mTOR + [ ( 0.47\u00b10.44 )%], CD3 + p-S6 + [(0.21\u00b10.21)%] and CD3 + CD8 \u2212 p-S6 +[ (0.17\u00b10.14)%] were lower than those of normal controls ( P<0.05 ) respectively, whlie there were no significant differences in expression of IFN-\u03b3 in T cells [ (12.85\u00b112.47)%, (7.11\u00b17.02)%, (20.29\u00b119.84)%] and p-S6 in CD3 + CD8 + cells [0.65\u00b10.64)% ] ( P>0.05 ). Upon RAPA treatment, in CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 \u2212 and CD3 + CD8 + T cells of MDS-1 group, p-mTOR was inhibited more than 50% in 5of 10 cases; p-S6 was inhibited in 2, 4, and 6 cases, respectively, and IFN-\u03b3 was inhibited in 4, 4, 3 cases respectively. Conclusions In FAB low-risk MDS, the signal pathway of mTOR/S6 was activated, and it was quiescent in normal controls,. The expression of p-mTOR, p-S6 and IFN-\u03b3 of this signal pathway in FAB low-risk MDS was heterogeneous. RAPA could suppress mTOR/S6/IFN-\u03b3 in partial patients with low-risk MDS."
