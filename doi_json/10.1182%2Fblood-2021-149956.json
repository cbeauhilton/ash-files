    "abstract_text": "Beta thalassemia is one of the most common recessive hematological disorders in the world with more than 200 mutations identified to date. These mutations reduce or completely abrogate beta globin expression. As beta globin pairs with alpha globin to form adult hemoglobin (HbA, \u03b12\u03b22), reduced or absent beta globin results in excessive alpha globin chains, which form toxic aggregates. These aggregates cause maturation blockade and premature death of erythroid precursors, and hemolysis of red blood cells (RBC), leading to varying degrees of anemia. Patients with the most severe form of beta thalassemia, namely beta thalassemia major, are transfusion-dependent, i.e., requiring life-long RBC transfusions accompanied by the burden of iron chelation therapy. EDIT-301 is an experimental autologous cell therapy in which CD34 + cells are genetically modified to promote gamma globin expression. EDIT-301 is currently in clinical development for sickle cell disease, and IND enabling stage for transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT). Gamma globin decreases the alpha to beta globin chain imbalance in beta thalassemia by pairing with the over-abundant alpha globin chains to form fetal hemoglobin (HbF, \u03b12\u03b32). Gamma globin induction, and consequently HbF induction, for EDIT-301 is achieved through AsCas12a ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-mediated editing of the distal CCAAT box region of the HBG1 and HBG2 promoters, where naturally occurring hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HFPH) mutations exist. We chose this target over BCL11A based on previous preclinical data demonstrating that BCL11A editing reduces erythroid output in NBSGW mice. An engineered AsCas12a RNP edits the HBG1 and HBG2 promoter distal CCAAT box with high efficiency and specificity. We have previously shown that on-target editing of >80% was achieved in mobilized peripheral blood (mPB) CD34 + cells from normal donors with no detectable off-target editing both at research scale and at clinical manufacturing scale. Edited normal donor CD34 + cells led to long-term, polyclonal, multilineage engraftment without lineage skewing in immunocompromised mice and sustained robust HbF production in their erythroid progeny. To test whether EDIT-301 may be an efficacious therapy for TDT, mPB CD34 + cells from individuals with TDT were electroporated with the engineered AsCas12a RNP targeting the HBG1 and HBG2 promoters. AsCas12a RNP edited mPB CD34 + cells from individuals with TDT as efficiently as CD34 + cells from normal donors. Importantly, EDIT-301 has the potential to address the underlying pathophysiology of TDT, i.e., the maturation blockade and premature death of erythroid precursors. Erythroid differentiation of edited beta thalassemia CD34 + cells showed significant improvement in erythroid maturation and health. Specifically, ~70% edited erythroblasts reached late erythroblast stage compared to ~53% unedited erythroblasts; ~56% edited erythroid cells underwent terminal maturation and enucleated compared to ~28% of unedited erythroid cells; and non-viable erythroblasts decreased from ~33% to ~22% after editing. The improved erythropoiesis was accompanied by significantly increased total hemoglobin content per cell. These data strongly support that editing of the HBG1 and HBG2 promoter CCAAT box using engineered AsCas12a RNP can reverse the dyserythropoiesis associated with beta thalassemia and increase the hemoglobin production. In summary, we have provided strong preclinical data supporting the development of EDIT-301 for the treatment of TDT. Edited mPB CD34 + cells retained their ability to engraft without lineage skewing, resulted in robust HbF induction long-term, improved erythropoiesis, and increased hemoglobin content in TDT erythroid cells. These data support that a single administration of EDIT-301 may have the potential to safely and effectively reverse dyserythropoiesis and ameliorate anemia in individuals with TDT long-term. Clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of EDIT-301 in the treatment of TDT are currently being planned.
