    "abstract_text": "Introduction Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a genetical hemolytic disorder defined as chronic inflammatory disease. Nitrite (NO -2 ) in SCA (HbSS) patients may be associated with the hemolytic process while fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) presents protective effect in these patients. Serum NO -2 interferes with the role of Hb F in reducing the hemolytic process contributing to vaso-occlusive crises. Aims The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation of the serum levels of nitrite with fetal hemoglobin, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides levels in HbSS patients in steady-state of the Centro de Refer\u00eancia em Doen\u00e7a Falciforme de Itabuna (CERDOFI), Bahia, Brazil. Methods Forty-two patients diagnosed with SCA were included at baseline. Diagnosis was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Serum levels of nitrite were performed using Griess reaction, and fetal hemoglobin, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides levels were measured by biochemical methods. The experimental protocol was approved by the Researcher Board Committee on Human Research, Gon\u00e7alo Moniz Research Center and informed consents were signed by patients. Results Our results showed a significant increase in NO -2 (p<0.0001) in adult patients with SCA compared to the control group (healthy volunteers). Data demonstrated a negative correlation between nitrite and fetal hemoglobin (p=0.004, r=-0.627). No correlation was found between fetal hemoglobin or nitrite with LDL-Cl and triglycerides. Conclusion The results reinforce that the serum nitrite can predict the clinical disease course. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
