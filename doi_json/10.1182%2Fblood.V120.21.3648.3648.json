Early prediction of response to the therapy may offer the potential to identify patients who will benefit this therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) combined positron emission tomographic-computed tomographic (FDG-PET/CT) imaging for assessment of therapy and predicting outcome in 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy. Methods: Radioimmunotherapy with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan was preformed in 52 patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B cell lymphoma (follicular lymphoma, 45; mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, 5; lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, 2) at Hyogo College of Medicine Hospital from June 2009 through August 2012. FDG-PET/CT scanning was performed at two weeks and the later after 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan therapy. Results: In FDG-PET at 2 weeks after 90Y-ibritumomab therapy, 26 (50%) showed complete response (defined as early CR), 20 (38%) showed partial response (PR-2W) and 6 (12%) showed non response (NR-2W). Further follow-up revealed 10 later CR (8 CR out of 20 PR-2W and 2 CR out of 6 NR-2W), showing 69 %(36) of overall CR rate. Relapse was occurred in 4(17%) of 26 early CR and in 6 (60%) of 10 later CR, indicating significantly low relapse late in early CR (P= 0.0074, by Chi-square test). Patients with early CR (CR in 2 weeks after the RIT) showed significantly better progression free survival than those with later CR (P=0.0046, by Logrank test). In contrast, analysis at six weeks after the RIT showed 36 CR patients (10 of which eventually relapse), but failed to discriminate patients who had high risk of relapse. Conclusion: Our results suggest that CR assessed by FDG-PET/CT at 2 weeks after 90 Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan therapy discriminates good responder to the RIT and predicts better progression free survival in relapsed or refractory indolent B cell lymphoma.
