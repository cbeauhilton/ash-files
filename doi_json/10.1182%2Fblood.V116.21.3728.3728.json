    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3728 CD28 costimulation is required for the generation of naturally-derived regulatory T cells (nTregs) in the thymus through Lck-signaling. However, it is not clear how CD28 costimulation regulates the generation of induced Tregs (iTregs) from nai\u0308ve CD4 T-cell precursors in the periphery. To address this question, we induced iTregs (CD25 + Foxp3 + ) from nai\u0308ve CD4 T cells (CD25 \u2212 Foxp3 \u2212 ) by TCR-stimulation with additional TGF\u03b2 in vitro , and found that the generation of iTregs was inversely related to the level of CD28 costimulation independently of IL-2. By using a series of transgenic mice on CD28-deficient background that bears WT CD28 or mutated CD28 in its cytosolic tail incapable of binding to Lck, PI3K or Itk, we found that CD28-mediated Lck-signaling plays an essential role in the suppression of iTreg generation under strong CD28 costimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that T cells with the CD28 receptor incapable of activating Lck were prone to iTreg induction in vivo , which contributed to their reduced ability to cause graft-versus-host disease. These findings reveal a novel mechanistic insight into how CD28 costimulation negatively regulates the generation of iTregs, and provide the rationale for promoting T-cell immunity or tolerance by regulating Tregs through targeting CD28-signaling.
