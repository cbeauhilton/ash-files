    "abstract_text": "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by the presence of PML-RARA fusion protein. The PML-RARA oncoprotein is known to be the initiating factor for APL development. We have previously found that miR-125b is highly expressed in APL and upregulated by PML-RARA. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PML-RARA controls miR-125b expression had been uncharacterized. In the present study, we further confirmed that expression of PML-RARA resulted in a significant increase in primary miR-125b expression, and we found that the nuclear transcription factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) targeting genes (HO1) was also upregulated (Figure 1A). Consistently, HO1 and miR-125b are transcriptionally upregulated by proteasome inhibitor (MG132) which has been showed to activate Nrf2 (Figure 1B). Knockdown of Nrf2 can inhibit the effect of PML-RARA expression and MG132 (Figure 1C). Thus, these results indicated that Nrf2 may mediate PML-RARA-induced miR-125b expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated the importance of miR-125b in APL cell proliferation (Figure 1D), we showed that promoting leukemic cell grow is associated with AKT pathway and MAPK signaling (Figure 1E). Subsequent bioinformatic and RNA-seq data analysis (Figure 1F and G) identified CEBPA as a putative target of miR-125b, and we further experimentally verified using luciferase reporter constructs (Figure H). In conclusion, we identified the mechanisms responsible for the high expression and the function of miR-125b in APL, suggesting that the expression of miR-125b could be a primary oncogenic event in APL leukemogenesis.
