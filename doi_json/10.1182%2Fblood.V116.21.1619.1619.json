    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1619 Background: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a chronic debilitating hematologic condition caused by a missense mutation within the adult beta globin gene leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Increased Fetal Hemoglobin production has been shown to significantly ameliorate SCD symptoms and improve survival. A novel specific DNA-binding factor DRED (direct repeat erythroid definitive) was recently identified that regulated epsilon and gamma globin gene expression ( Tanimoto et al Genes Dev 2000 ). Purification of DRED revealed that it harbored the nuclear orphan hormone receptors, TR2/TR4, as its DNA binding core ( Tanabe et al EMBO 2002 ). Overexpression of TR2/TR4 Transgene within Human Beta Globin Yeast Artificial Chromosome Transgenic Mice resulted in 4-fold induction of the gamma globin mRNA levels ( Tanabe et al EMBO 2007 ). Therefore, we wanted to determine if the overexpression of TR2/TR4 within a humanized sickle cell disease model would result in fetal hemoglobin induction. Methods: Humanized Homozygous Knock-In UAB-Sickle Cell (UAB-Hba h\u03b1/h\u03b1 Hbb h\u03b2s/h\u03b2s ) Mice ( Wu et al Blood 2006 ) was mated to TR2/TR4 Overexpressing Mice (Tg TR2/TR4 ) to generate homozygous SS-TR2/TR4 compound heterozygotes (UAB-Hba h\u03b1/h\u03b1 Hbb h\u03b2s/h\u03b2s Tg TR2/TR4 ). We generated four 2\u20133 month old homozygous SS-TR2/TR4 transgenic mice and compared hemoglobin F levels, complete blood cell counts and % body weight (liver, spleen, kidney) to six 2\u20133 month old homozygous SS mice (Hba h\u03b1/h\u03b1 Hbb h\u03b2s/h\u03b2s )without the overexpressing Tg TR2/TR4 . Tail PCR genotyping of all sickle cell mice (with and without Tg TR2/TR4 ) and Hemoglobin F(Hgb F) and Sickle (HgbS) levels were confirmed by HPLC Hemoglobin electrophoresis. Results: The mean Hgb F: 7.8% (n=6, sd 1.63+/\u2212) in the homozygous SS control mice vs. 16.5% (n=4, sd 2.64+/\u2212)in the homozygous SS-TR2/4 Mice (2 Fold higher). Hematologic profile revealed a mean Hct: 25.2 (n=6, sd 5.50 +/\u2212) mean MCV: 75.4 (n=6, sd 10+/\u2212) and a mean WBC: 22.6 (n= 6, sd 13.9 +/\u2212) in the homozygous SS control mice vs. a mean Hct: 31.25(n=4, sd 6.89+/\u2212), mean MCV: 61(n=4, sd 3.5+/\u2212) mean WBC: 16.3(n= 4, sd 5.99+/\u2212) in the homozygous SS-TR2/TR4 mice. Lastly, initial organ (spleen, liver, kidney) pathology evaluation revealed decreased % body weight (bw) in homozygous SS TR2/TR4 Mice vs. homozygous SS controls: 1) Spleen %bw: 4.3% vs. 3.5% TgTR2/TR4), 2) Liver % bw: 8.8% vs. 7.7% TgTR2/TR4), and 3) Kidney %bw: 1.14% vs. 1.02% TgTR2/TR4). Conclusions: Our preliminary analysis revealed that TR2/TR4 overexpression within a humanized sickle cell disease mouse model resulted in a 2-fold induction of fetal hemoglobin based on HPLC hemoglobin electrophoresis. Further, increased TR2/TR4 overexpression improved anemia and organomegaly within sickle cell disease mice. TR2/TR4 may be an attractive target for fetal hemoglobin induction for the treatment of sickle cell disease. Ongoing studies will determine if TR2/TR4 decreases organ specific disease pathology. We will also determine the cellular distribution of fetal hemoglobin in future studies. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
