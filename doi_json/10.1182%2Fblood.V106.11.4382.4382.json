    "abstract_text": "Herein we present the first global gene expression profile of purified cancer stem cells (CSCs). Constituting 0.08% of bone marrow cells, CD34 + CD38 \u2212 Thy-1 + cells represent the CSCs in 5q\u2212 myelodysplastic syndromes. The global gene expression pattern of purified 5q\u2212 CD34 + CD38 \u2212 Thy-1 + stem cells was overall very similar to the global gene expression of normal hematopoietic stem cells and not progenitor cells, supporting that 5q\u2212 stem cells originate in and outcompete normal CD34 + CD38 \u2212 Thy-1 + stem cells. However, a few distinct differences in gene expression distinguish 5q\u2212 from normal stem cells and might therefor be of potential pathogenetic importance. BMI1 , a critical regulator of self-renewal is up-regulated in most 5q\u2212 patients stem cells, which could explain the obvious advantage of the 5q\u2212 stem cells over normal stem cells. The myeloid transcription factor CEBP \u03b1 was clearly down-regulated in 5q\u2212 CD34 + CD38 + Thy-1 \u2212 progenitors compared to normal progenitors, consistent with the typical deficient myeloid differentiation seen in 5q\u2212 syndrome. In contrast, CEBP \u03b1 was rather up-regulated in 5q\u2212 stem cells from several patients. Thus, these studies demonstrate the importance of specifically identifying, characterizing and eventually targeting CSCs.",
