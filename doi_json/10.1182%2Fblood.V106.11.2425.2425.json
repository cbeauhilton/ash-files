    "abstract_text": "Ligands for the transcription factor PPAR\u03b3 are emerging as a new class of anti-tumor agents. Herein we report that the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO, a PPAR\u03b3 ligand that induces PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity in human DLCL OCI-Ly-19 cells, also induces cell death in human DLCL of both germinal center (OCI-Ly19) and activated B-cell phenotype (OCI-Ly10), cells which express the PPAR\u03b3 protein. This effect of CDDO appears to be independent of PPAR\u03b3 stimulated pathways since the functional antagonist of PPAR\u03b3, GW9662, which completely inhibits CDDO induced PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity was unable to prevent CDDO induced cell death. Similar findings were seen using the additional PPAR\u03b3 antagonists T0070907 and BADGE. CDDO induces cell death by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis as shown by Annexin-V and propidium iodide staining. As we have previously shown that PPAR\u03b3 ligands inhibit NF-\u03baB activity in B lymphocytes ( J. Immunol  2005 ; 174 (7): 4060 \u20139 ), we next examined the effect of CDDO on NF-\u03baB in DLCL cells. Surprisingly, exposure of Ly19 cells to CDDO resulted in a dose-, and time-dependent increase in the activity of both the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-\u03baB as determined by ELISA, by direct visualization of the nuclear translocation of p65 using indirect immunofluorescence assays, and by EMSA. The nuclear translocation of both the p50 and p65 NF-\u03baB subunits was also confirmed by performing immunoblot analyses using nuclear fractions of CDDO-treated Ly19 cells. NF-\u03baB activation was also observed in Ly10 cells exposed to CDDO. Follow-up experiments revealed that the activation of NF-\u03baB in Ly19 cells by CDDO was due to proteolysis of inhibitory I\u03baB\u03b1 molecules. To determine whether the CDDO-induced NF-\u03baB activation was a pro- survival mechanism, Ly19 and Ly10 cells were pre-treated with the NF-\u03baB inhibitors SN50, helenalin or BAY 11-7082 and then exposed to CDDO for 24 hrs. In all cases, the NF-\u03baB inhibitors significantly enhanced CDDO induced cell death suggesting that NF-\u03baB activation is an anti-apoptotic mechanism elicited to protect the cell against CDDO cytotoxicity. Collectively, these studies suggest that; (a) CDDO (which will shortly be entering clinical trials for patients with acute myeloid leukemia) as a single agent may have significant clinical activity in patients with DLCL and; (b) the combination of CDDO with pharmacological inhibitors of NF-\u03baB would be a rationale combination of novel agents to test in the context of clinical trials for patients with DLCL."
