    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3094 The HLA class II DRB1 antigen DR15 is an important immunobiologic marker in immune mediated marrow failure states. DR15 has also been reported in small studies to be associated with favorable outcomes (reduction in acute GVHD and reduced relapse resulting in improved overall survival) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. To elucidate the impact of DR15 on major transplant outcomes, we conducted a retrospective study of 2, 891 recipients of first marrow or mobilized peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (n=1038), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=700), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=948), or myelodysplastic syndrome (n=205) between 1990\u20132008 and reported to the CIBMTR registry. Selection was confined to HLA-identical sibling transplantation to avoid HLA-disparity as a driving force for observed differences. All patients received conventional myeloablative conditioning, T-replete grafts and cyclosporine plus methotrexate- based GVHD prophylaxis. DNA-based HLA typing allowed categorization of 732 (25.3%) patients as positive and 2159 (74.7%) patients as negative for DRB1*15 :01 or *15 :02 (DR15). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the HLA DR15-positive and -negative groups. In univariate analysis, HLA-DR15 status had no impact on neutrophil engraftment, acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) II-IV or III-IV, chronic GVHD, treatment related mortality, relapse, disease-free survival or overall survival. Confining the univariate analysis to myeloid malignancies did not alter these findings. Multivariate analysis models were constructed with DR15 status forced into the models in all steps of model building and the final model regardless of its statistical significance. Other variables tested included: donor/recipient age, CMV status, disease, disease stage, graft source, Karnofsky score, race and year of transplant. Variables that attained a p-value \u22640.05 were held in the final multivariate models. In multivariate analysis, DR15 status showed no significant difference in the primary outcomes of acute GVHD II-IV or III-IV, chronic GVHD, overall survival, or relapse. In conclusion, DR15 status had no impact on major HLA-matched sibling donor hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes in this large and homogenous cohort of leukemia and MDS patients.
