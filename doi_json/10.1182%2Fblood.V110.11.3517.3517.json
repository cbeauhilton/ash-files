    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is associated with significant immune dysfunction. Although various mechanisms mediating immune dysregulation in MM have been studied, its molecular and cellular basis is ill defined. IL-6, TGF-\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 have been implicated in this process, but their mechanism of effects on immune function have not been studied in MM. Together, IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 enhance the generation of T H 17 cells, important in the development of immunity and auto-immunity. Additionally, T H 17 cells are differentiated by number of inflammatory cytokines including, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23, and IL-27. Therefore, we evaluated the immune dysfunction and the role of T H 17 cells and associated pro-inflammatory cytokines in myeloma. We have previously characterized that the production of T H 1 mediated cytokines including IFN-\u03b3 following anti-CD3-mediated activation is significantly lower in myeloma PBMC compared to normal PBMC. We hypothesize that this may be regulated via skewing the immune system towards T H 17 pathway. We observed that T H 17 cells, measured by intra-cellular flow cytometry, are significantly increased in number in myeloma (16.9%) and MGUS (6.2%) compared to normal (3.3%). Furthermore, we analysed supporting pro-inflammatory cytokine network for the generation of T H 17 cells in myeloma, which may be responsible for the observed T H 17 skewing of T cell subsets. Sera from MGUS (n=12) and myeloma (n=17) patients were evaluated for the presence of these pro-inflammatory cytokines compared with normal sera (n=6) using ELISA. We observed significant increase in serum IL-21, IL-22 and IL-23 in MGUS (373 pg/ml, 14 pg/ml and 147 pg/ml respectively; p<0.05) and myeloma (296 pg/ml, 12 pg/ml and 215 pg/ml respectively; p<0.05) compared with normal (63 pg/ml, 1.5 pg/ml and 39 pg/ml respectively). In addition, we also observed that the myeloma PBMC stimulated in the presence of IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2, both of the cytokines present at a high level in myeloma, induced significant IL-23 production compared with normal. Importantly, IL-23 levels were 10 fold higher in myeloma BM samples compared with matching blood samples. These results indicate that the cytokines from myeloma BM microenvironment may be responsible for the observed T cell subset abnormality by favouring T H 17 cells via IL-23/IL-21 production. These cytokines thus may be targets to modulate immune responses in myeloma to enhance immune function and devise effective vaccination strategies in the future."
