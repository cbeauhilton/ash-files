    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4332 Allogeneic SCT is widely considered the therapy most likely to prolong survival in pts with AML in first CR(CR1) or relapse (REL). Questions have arisen regarding the frequency with which the procedure is undertaken in a defined population of pts presenting with newly-diagnosed AML and subsequently followed through REL and after, or in pts presenting in REL. We first analyzed 26 consecutive UW pts age < 70 who did not have CBF AML, who were not NPM1+/FLT3,- and who achieved CR1 with at least 4 months have elapsing from presentation date. These patients would typically be considered candidates for SCT in CR1 Eleven of the 26(42%, 95% CI 23-63%) received SCT at a median of 3.5 months (range 0.5-9.0) from CR date. Rates of SCT were 42% both in pts age <60(8/19) and in pts \u2265 60 (3/ 7). In contrast to a report from another institute in which 14/99 pts age \u226550 received SCT in CR1 7/16 of the current pts did so (p=0.01). Rates of SCT were 6/13 in pts at highest risk based on cytogenetics and FLT3 status and 3/11 in pts at lower (i.e. \u201cintermediate\u201d risk; risk status not known in 2) Three of the 15 pts who did not receive SCT had available donors, but 12 were not HLA \u2013typed. Age distribution was similar (p=0.31) in pts who were and were not HLA-typed and in only 2 non-typed pts were financial considerations or pt refusal an issue. Rather, notes suggested that physicians felt that pts were doing well and might not need SCT. We also examined our 21 consecutive pts who were under age 70, did not receive SCT in CR1, and were given first salvage therapy (S1) for relapse, again with at least 4 months follow-up from relapse date. These 21 included patients referred to us at initial diagnosis or only at time of S1. The frequency with which they were transplanted (8/21; 38% 95%CI 18-62%) did not differ from the frequency with which SCT was done in CR1. However SCT was most commonly done as 2 nd salvage therapy (4 cases), with 3 pts transplanted in CR2 or CR and only 1 given SCT as S1.10 of the 13 S1 pts never given SCT had available donors (3 related, 3 unrelated, 4 cord) with SCT not done because of high blasts and/or poor performance status. We conclude that although older and younger pts may be equally likely to receive SCT in CR1, failure to HLA type may be a major impediment to increasing rates of SCT in CR1. Although relapsed pts are transplanted as often as pts in CR1, such transplants are only rarely used as initial therapy of relapse. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
