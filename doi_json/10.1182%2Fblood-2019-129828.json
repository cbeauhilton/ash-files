    "abstract_text": "Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous disease of the blood and bone marrow primarily affecting older populations. Chemotherapy has been the standard of care for four decades, just 10% of elderly patients show a response and it will be curative in only a third of patients aged 18-60. Therefore, it's necessary to identify new therapeutic targets for improved treatment options. The search for novel mutations within the genomes of karyotypically normal AML patients identified Cohesin's STAG2 as a recurrently mutated gene (6%). Cohesin is a ring-shaped multimeric protein complex which has a multitude of roles including maintaining sister chromatid cohesion, DNA replication and repair, gene expression and chromatin architecture. STAG2 remains the most understudied Cohesin gene, how a mutation affects the ability of Cohesin to fulfil certain roles needs elucidation as well as how STAG2 functions as part of Cohesin to repair DNA breaks, promote faithful replication and control gene expression. Therefore, we sought to explore the consequences of loss-of-function STAG2 mutations on DNA repair and replication using a STAG2 knockout (\u0394STAG2) isogenic cell line model created using CRISPR/Cas9. Immunofluorescent staining of DNA damage repair proteins 53BP1 and RAD51 following 2Gy irradiation (IR) suggests \u0394STAG2 cells have a significant DNA repair defect. The average 53BP1 and RAD51 foci counts were significantly higher (p=0.001) in mutant cells which had three times as many foci at 24 hours after IR. In addition, 40% of \u0394STAG2 cells stain positive for 53BP1 and RAD51 respectively at 24 hours post-IR. This damage persists at 48 and 72 hours, whereas wild type (WT) damage returns to basal levels. Given that our data suggests a HR defect, we assessed the response of WT and \u0394STAG2 cells to PARP inhibitors (PARPi). Interestingly, \u0394STAG2 cells showed significantly greater sensitivity than WT cells to highly potent PARPi Talazoparib with an IC50 of 62nM. We next assayed single DNA fibres to evaluate the implications of a STAG2 mutation on the dynamics of individual replication forks. Interestingly, we observed a significantly reduced number of ongoing replication forks compared to WT cells (p=0.01) with a concomitant increase in the number of stalled forks (p=0.01) in the absence of exogeneous DNA damage. Following treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) this phenotype was exacerbated and \u0394STAG2 cells exhibit significantly more stalled replication forks than WTs (p=0.001). This indicates a role for STAG2 in maintaining replication fork stability and promoting fork restart following replication stress. Importantly, our data identifies a potential DNA damage repair deficiency that sensitises \u0394STAG2 cells to PARPi monotherapy as well as unearthing an essential role for STAG2 in replication fork progression and fork stability. This mutation could therefore be exploited therapeutically and represents a novel therapeutic target/approach for AML patients with mutated STAG2.
