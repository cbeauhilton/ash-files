    "abstract_text": "It has long been recognized that individuals who express variations of the hemoglobin-A (HbA) protein experience less severe malaria disease. As malaria remains to be one of the most significant infectious diseases in history, this human adaptation has led to the persistence of HbA variants (HbVARs) in the population. The intricate lifecycle of the parasite which causes the most cases of clinical malaria, Plasmodium falciparum , relies on both asexual and sexual reproductive cycles, with host to vector transmission reliant on sexual stage gametocyte formation. Multiple epidemiological studies have shown that HbVARs may influence gametocyte production during P. falciparum infection, with greater gametocyte numbers reported in individuals with hemoglobin variant containing erythrocytes (Hb VAR-Ery) when compared to hemoglobin A containing erythrocytes (Hb A-Ery). Here we provide experimental support for these studies by showing significantly higher sexual differentiation rates among parasites grown in Hb S containing erythrocytes (Hb S-Ery) obtained from sickle cell patients than those differentiated in Hb A-Ery (p=0.038). Because the digestion of hemoglobin is such an integral part of the intraerythrocytic cycle, we then sought to determine whether there was a difference between the hydrolysis efficiencies of HbA and other hemoglobin variants (HbVAR). By using a prominent recombinant P. falciparum hemoglobinase we found the hydrolysis efficiency of HbA to be significantly (p=0.0058) more efficient after 24 hours compared to a HbVAR sample containing mixed amounts of HbA, HbF, and HbS. To further determine whether there is a link between hemoglobin digestion efficiency and sexual differentiation, we therapeutically inhibited the hemoglobin digestion and hemozoin formation process in a culture of P. falciparum using sub-optimal doses of chloroquine diphosphate. We found a significant difference (p<0.001) among gametocyte conversion rates between treated and non-treated cultures, as well as a moderate negative correlation between hemozoin formation and gametocyte conversion rate (Pearson r=0.72, p=0.008). Gene expression analysis also revealed patterns of expression that were consistent with increased gametocytogenesis. We conclude that hemoglobin type plays a significant role in the process of sexual conversion in P. falciparum . Though further studies should be completed in order to confirm these results, these findings may suggest hemoglobin digestion efficiency as a causative factor for sexual differentiation. As individuals with hemoglobinopathies make up approximately 7% of the global population, and malaria infection rates have been shown to differ depending on these genetic dynamics, these findings may support the creation of targeted initiatives to reduce transmission specifically in areas where there is a high percentage of hemoglobinopathy carriage.
