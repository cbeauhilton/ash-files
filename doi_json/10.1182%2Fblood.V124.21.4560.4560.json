    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Dasatinib is a second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor that has a 325-fold higher potency than imatinib and a 16-fold higher potency than nilotinib in vitro. Recent reports suggested that absolute lymphocytosis in response to dasatinib for chronic phase (CP) \u2013chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) might be associated with favorable response. However, as the fluctuation of lymphocytosis was often observed, it is sometimes difficult to define lymphocytosis. To evaluate how much increase and how long continuation of lymphocytosis affects the better clinical efficacy, we developed an index (DL index; Dasatinib induced Lymphocytosis index) that combines duration and increase of lymphocytosis. The aim of this study was to test the DL index as a predictor of Major Molecular Response (MMR) at 12 month. PATIENTS and METHODS: The DL area was based on a graph plotting the absolute lymphocyte counts and was the area under the lymphocyte curve using trapezoidal method. DL index was DL area divided by weeks. For example, DL index 12W was defined as (DL area from 4 to 12 weeks) divided by (12-4) weeks. We tested the DL index 12W in 30 patients who developed MMR at 12 months (MMR group) and 9 patients without MMR (non-MMR group). RESULTS and DISCUSSION: DL score 12w in MMR group and non-MMR group were 2714.0 (95% CI; 2286.0-3142.2, n=30) and 1559.9 (95% CI; 1006.9- 2113.0, n=9) respectively. There was a significant difference between MMR group and non-MMR group in DL index 12W by t-test ( Figure 1 , p=0.0016). A significant linear relationship was obtained between DL index 12w and the peaked lymphocyte counts within 12 weeks by Spearman's correlation coefficient rank test ( Figure 2 , p=1.97E-07, correlation coefficient=0.91). The DL index 12w , 2,113, which was the upper limit of non-MMR group 95% CI, is equivalent to 2,909/\u00b5l in lymphocyte count, and the DL index 12w , 2,286, which is the lower limit of MMR group 95% CI, equivalent to 3,123/\u00b5l in lymphocyte count. Therefore, we divided all patients (n=39) into two groups, equal or more than 3,123/\u00b5l and less than 3,123/\u00b5l in the peaked lymphocyte counts. The patients with the peaked lymphocyte counts \u2265 3,123/\u00b5l reached MMR at 12 months (19/20=95.0%) to compare those less than 3,123/\u00b5l (11/19=57.9%) (p=0.0075). CONCLUSION: The peaked lymphocyte number, induced by the DL index 12w , which calculation was extremely easy, was associated with molecular response. These data suggests that this tool can be useful in interpreting the results of molecular response at 12 months.
