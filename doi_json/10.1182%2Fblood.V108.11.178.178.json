    "abstract_text": "The glycosylation-profile of von Willebrand factor (VWF) is known to strongly influence its plasma levels. VWF contains several carbohydrate structures, including O -linked glycans that primarily consist of the sialylated T-antigen (NeuAc( \u03b1 2\u20133)Gal( \u03b2 1\u20133)[NeuAc( \u03b1 2\u20136)]GalNAc). It is unknown yet if O -linked carbohydrates affect VWF levels. We therefore developed an immunosorbent-based assay using the lectin Peanut Agglutinin (PNA) to determine O -linked T-antigen on VWF. Control experiments showed that PNA-binding was: (i) specific to T-antigen that was de-sialylated via neuramidase-treatment; (ii) proportional to the number of O -linked glycosylation sites and (iii) independent of the extent of multimerisation. Using this assay, we found a strong correlation between PNA binding and VWF-antigen levels in a series of randomly selected plasma samples (252\u00b1125% for VWF1.5 U/ml (n=19); p <0.003). Reduced or increased PNA binding was also observed for patients characterized by increased (liver cirrhosis; n=58) or reduced (von Willebrand disease (VWD)-type 1; n=32) VWF-antigen levels, respectively. VWD-type 1 patients further displayed increased ratios of propeptide over mature VWF-antigen levels (0.38\u00b10.18 versus 0.17\u00b10.03 for patients (n=32) and controls (n=20), respectively; p <0.0001), which is indicative for reduced VWF survival in these patients. Interestingly, a linear relation between PNA binding and propeptide/VWF ratio was observed (Spearman rank= 0.50; p =0.0039), suggesting a potential association between T-antigen glycosylation and VWF survival. Finally, we observed a marked decrease in PNA binding in post-DDAVP samples from various patients (131\u00b145% versus 85\u00b133% in pre- and post DDAVP, respectively; n=18; p =0.0013). Since these patients had distinct underlying pathologies (primary platelet function disorder, hemophilia A or VWD type 1, 2A or 2N), this seems to represent a general phenomenon that is not restricted to VWD. Moreover, it indicates that the O -linked glycosylation profile of VWF stored in endothelial storage-organelles may differ from that of constitutively secreted VWF.",
