    "abstract_text": "The molecular pathogenesis of Systemic Mastocytosis (SM) is driven by mutations in the KIT gene, with 95% of patients having a mutation in exon 17, D816V, leading to constant proliferation of mast cells (Garcia-Montero et al, 2006; Jara-Acevedo et al, 2015; Vaes et al, 2017). Targeted therapeutics have revealed clinical activity in these patients, but toxicities such as cognitive effects, intracranial hemorrhage, hypertension, and edema may limit dosing and availability of these therapies. While the exact cause of these effects is difficult to determine, numerous closely related kinases, such as wild type PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, KIT, VEGFR2 (KDR), and CSF1R (FMS), are considered to be anti-targets, with previous evidence of their inhibition linked to observed clinical toxicities (Liu & Kurzrock, 2015; Giles et al., 2009; Jayson et al., 2005). Bezuclastinib (CGT9486) was designed to selectively inhibit KIT D816V versus these other closely related kinase anti-targets. Additionally, we demonstrate that bezuclastinib has minimal brain penetration, together with no observed CNS-related toxicities in nonclinical studies. Herein, we present results from cell-based kinase profiling assays, which demonstrate that bezuclastinib has a significant and unique selectivity to KIT D816V relative to the aforementioned kinases when tested head-to-head against other clinically relevant compounds in SM. Additionally, a similar selectivity profile was observed for a broader panel of kinases, ion channels, transporters, and enzymes, which will be presented here, including drug concentrations and target engagement achieved with recent in vivo studies. Importantly, we also show that bezuclastinib has minimal brain penetration, a preferred feature of an anti-Kit molecule due to CNS-related adverse events observed in these indications. In a tissue distribution study performed in rats, bezuclastinib shows a brain:plasma ratio <0.1 following 3 day administration at 25 mg/kg, a dose that closely correlates with clinical plasma exposure. This was supported functionally by assessing neurobehavioral effects of bezuclastinib at dose levels up to 100 mg/kg in rats which showed no CNS related effects. This attractive selectivity and nonclinical safety profile, combined with early clinical data in advanced solid tumors (Trent et al, 2020), supports the potential for a best-in-class KIT inhibitor. Bezuclastinib is currently under clinical investigation in advanced SM with additional clinical studies planned in non-advanced SM and imatinib-resistant GIST.
