    "abstract_text": "Genetic neutropenias are heterogeneous group of hematological diseases characterized by impaired survival and maturation of myeloid precursors in bone marrow. G-CSF and HSCT are currently the only effective treatment options. MK-0339 is a potent, cell permeable, orally absorbed inhibitor of neutrophil elastase (NE), previously investigated in preclinical and clinical studies by Merck/DuPont as a potential anti-inflammatory drug. We have previously reported that MK-0339 increases neutrophil proliferation in cellular models of ELANE associated neutropenia (2016 [ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts] Blood. 2016;128:406; 2017 J Leuk Biol [in press]). To examine the specificity of these responses, we investigated the effects of MK-0339 on iPSCs from healthy volunteers and compared its effects on differentiation of iPSC derived from patients with ELANE , TCIRG-1 and CXCR4 associated neutropenia. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from dermal fibroblasts from healthy volunteers and neutropenic patients harboring ELANE, TCIRG1 and CXCR4 mutations and developed a feeder free, reproducible and efficient protocol for myeloid differentiation. In our initial experiments, we observed that iPSC lines derived from patients with ELANE mutations (P139L and G214R) consistently grew much slower and formed much smaller colonies than the controls using both mTeSR1/matrigel and DEF-CS feeder free culture medium systems. We observed more than 3-fold growth reduction of patient derived lines compared to healthy volunteers. We next tested the effects of MK-0339 under the same culture conditions. Growth of control and ELANE patient cell lines was enhanced, and the cells appeared more robust, after addition of 1uM MK-0339. We were surprised to see a similar proliferative effect (~40% increase) with Ramos (human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line) cells cultured in the presence of 1uM MK-0339, although neither the Ramos cells nor the ELANE iPSCs had detectable levels of ELANE expression. The enhanced growth of control and patient iPSCs and the results with Ramos cells suggested that the effects of MK-0339 are not solely mediated via inhibition of NE. We next compared myeloid differentiation and CD34 + cell proliferation of iPSC from patients with ELANE, TCIRG1 and CXCR4 associated neutropenia in HPC expansion medium, using granulocytic differentiation markers and flow cytometry. Myeloid maturation was impaired and inefficient for both ELANE (P139L and G214R) patient derived cell lines. Myeloid differentiation of the TCIRG1 patient derived was also impaired. Introduction of MK-0339 restored the impaired myeloid differentiation capacity of both ELANE and TCIRG1 positive patient derived cell lines. An iPSC line derived from a WHIM ( CXCR4 mutation) patient appeared to have normal maturation and proliferation. Western blot analysis revealed elevated levels of endoplasmic reticulum chaperone GRP78/BiP in ELANE and TCIRG1 mutant cell lines which was corrected by MK-0339 treatment. These studies demonstrate heretofore unreported proliferative effects of MK-0339 on cell lines not expressing neutrophil elastase. They suggest important mechanisms beyond enzyme inhibition to account for these findings. Although preliminary, we believe that this work suggests that MK-0339 may be a novel, oral therapy for both ELANE and non-ELANE associated neutropenia.
