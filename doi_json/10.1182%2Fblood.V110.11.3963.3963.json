    "abstract_text": "We describe a 21-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who first presented with an thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and compare the clinical manifestations and prognosis between SLE patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in the reported literature. At the time of admission, she was suffering from petechia, purpura and had neurological symptoms. Laboratory findings demonstrated haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopaenia and high levels of fragmentocytes. Serological test results were highly positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) with a particle fluorescent pattern, and also detected antibodies against Smith antibody, RNP antibody and SSA antibody but was negative for dsDNA. Direct Coombs-test was positive and D-dimer was negtive. The activity of ADAMTS13 was significantly reduced even after 4 times plasmapheresis. TTP as presenting sign in the patient with SLE was diagnosed. After 5 times plasmapheresis treatments and immunosuppressive therapy she recovered and abnormal laboratory tests were gradually returned to normal. With a follow-up of 20 months, she had a normal life. Compared with other reports, TTP can be differentiated from other thrombotic microangiopathic syndromes by its normal levels of prothrombin time, partially activated thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen and direct Coombs-test. But TTP might also be a complication of SLE and the manifestations of TTP are similar to those in SLE. The detection of the fragmentation of peripheral red blood cells helped the early diagnosis of TTP. Coomb\u2019s test might be positive when patient with TTP had SLE. ADAMTS13 and its inhibitory antibody had an important role in the pathogenesis of TTP. Plasma exchange combined with corticosteroid and cyclophsphamide should be used as early as possible in TTP patient with SLE. The prognosis was related to the treatment time and methods including plasmapheresis.",
