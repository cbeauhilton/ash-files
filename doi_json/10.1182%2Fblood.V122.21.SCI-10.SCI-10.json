    "abstract_text": "Regulatory elements control the anatomic and cellular contexts, timing, and magnitude of gene expression patterns. Under the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics Projects, human regulatory DNA has been mapped using a variety of approaches in over 300 cell and tissue types and developmental states. Collectively, the human genome encodes several million regulatory elements, most of which are located at some distance from promoters. The vast majority of these elements exhibit exquisite cell-and lineage-selective activation patterns, providing novel insights into the coordination of gene expression patterns. Genomic footprinting is a new and powerful technology that enables simultaneous profiling of the occupancy of hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors within regulatory regions. These profiles in turn enable construction of transcription factor regulatory networks that are providing new insights into how cell-and lineage-specific gene expression programs arise. Hundreds of genetic variants associated with a wide range of hematological traits and disorders localize within regulatory regions. Many such variants disrupt specific transcription factor-DNA interactions, exposing pathophysiologically relevant transcriptional regulatory pathways.
