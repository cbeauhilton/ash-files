    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Bcr-abl1 oncogene targeted treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) showed an impressive efficacy against proliferating chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. However, rapid relapses in more than half of CML patients after discontinuation of the treatment suggest a presence of quiescent leukemic stem cells inherently resistant to BCR-ABL1 inhibition. Understanding the heterogeneity of CML stem cell compartment is crucial for preventing the treatment failure. Specificity of already established leukemic stem cell (LSC) markers has been tested mainly in bulk CD34+CD38- populations at diagnosis. Phenotypes and molecular signatures of therapy resistant BCR ABL1 positive stem cells is however yet to be established. AIMS: Identification of BCR-ABL1 dependent LSC markers at single cell level by direct comparison their surface and transcript expression with the levels and the presence of BCR-ABL1 transcript at diagnosis and after administration of TKI treatment. METHODS: Total number of 375 cells were obtained from bone marrow and peripheral blood of 4 chronic phase CML patients. Cells were collected prior any treatment and three months after TKI treatment initiation. Normal bone marrow cells and BCR-ABL1 positive K562 cell line were used as controls. Indexed immuno-phenotyping and sorting of CD34+CD38- single cells was performed using a panel of 11 specific surface markers. Collected single cells were lysed and cDNA was enriched for 11 targets using 22 cycle pre-amplification. Expression profiling was carried on SmartChip real-time PCR system (Takara Bio) detecting following genes: BCR-ABL1, CD26, CD25, IL1-Rap, CD56, CD90, CD93, CD69, KI67, and control genes GUS and HPRT. Unsupervised clustering was performed using principal component analysis (PCA). Correlations were measured by Spearman rank method. RESULTS: At diagnosis, majority of BCR-ABL1+ C34+CD38- stem cells co-express IL1-Rap, CD26, and CD69 on their surface (88%, 82%, 78% overlap). Only 56% of BCR-ABL1+ cells positive for aforementioned markers co-express CD25, 28% CD93 and 16% CD56. The expression of these markers could also be detected in 4-11% of BCR-ABL1- cell, although this could be technical inaccuracy caused by the single cell profiling. CD90 marker did not show any correlation with BCR-ABL1 expression. At transcript level the expression of IL-1Rap, CD26, CD25 and CD56 was observed in 62%, 52% 45% and 16% BCR-ABL1+ cells, and up to 7% of BCR-ABL1- cells. CD69 expression was observed in 90% of BCR-ABL+ cells at transcript level, but also in 71% BCR-ABL- cells. BCR-ABL1 independent expression was observed for cKIT. (60% vs. 76 % in positive vs negative). Finally proliferation marker KI67 was expressed only in 6% of the BCR-ABL1+ cells. PCA analysis divided cells into several distinct clusters with BCR-ABL1 as the main contributor, and cKIT, CD69 and CD26, IL-1RAP as other significant factors. Interestingly BCR-ABL1+ cells collected during TKI treatment showed persistent surface expression of IL-1Rap and CD26, while CD56, CD69 and CD93 were only on part of the BCR-ABL1+ cells. CD25 was significantly deregulated during TKI treatment. CONCLUSION: At diagnosis up to 80% of LSC co-express 3 specific surface markers - IL-1RAP, CD26 and CD69. Variable portion of LSC co-express additional markers such are CD25, CD56 and CD93. During TKI treatment the surface expression of majority of markers is decreased, where the best correlated LSC marker is IL-1Rap, followed by CD26 and CD69. CD56 marker seems to persist in the same proportion of cells while CD25 disappears. cKIT is highly expressed in normal BM and HSC from CML patients, but also in some LSC. CD34+CD38- cells show non-proliferating phenotype. Disclosures Mayer: AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals AG: Research Funding."
