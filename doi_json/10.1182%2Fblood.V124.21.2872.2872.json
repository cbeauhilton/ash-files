    "abstract_text": "Warfarin remains the most commonly used oral anticoagulant. Its efficacy is closely correlated with the time in therapeutic range (TTR) of the international normalized ratio (INR). Excellent anticoagulant management systems can achieve TTRs in excess of 80%: however, in day-to-day clinical practice TTR values in the range of 50 to 60% are more commonly seen. Strategies to increase TTR are widely sought; one such intervention is the daily administration of low dose vitamin K (VK) administered to reduce variations in VK intake and thus reduce fluctuations in the INR due to such variability. In this multicentre, blinded, randomized controlled trial we allocated patients on chronic warfarin therapy to receive either 0.150 mg of daily oral VK, or matching placebo. After a one month \u201crun in period\u201d to allow adjustment of the warfarin dose, patients were followed for a maximum of 9 months (mean 6 months), their INR was determined, their TTR calculated and their mean warfarin dose calculated. A total of 253 patients were enrolled at 4 clinical centres between Aug 19, 2010 and Aug 30, 2013; 18 (9 in each group) were excluded from this analysis due to inadequate follow-up data, mostly as a result of withdrawal from the study during the run in period. Of the 117 analyzable patients allocated to VK, 66 were male (average age 66.9 yrs). Of the 118 analyzable patients allocated to placebo 59 were male (average age 65.7 yrs). Indications for warfarin were similar between the two groups, as was the frequency of renal insufficiency and the presence of cancer. Patients allocated to placebo were more likely to report a history of bleeding (7% vs 3%). Mean TTR over the 6 months prior to enrollment to the study was 54.6% in the placebo group, and 51.8% in the VK group. Mean TTR over an average follow-up of 6 months after completion of the 1 month run-in period was 66% in the placebo group, and 65.1% in the VK group. We conclude that inclusion in this study resulted in a statistically (and likely clinically) significant improvement in the TTR. The improvement in the TTR we observed appeared to be predominately as a result of attentive clinical management, rather than administration of VK. Our findings do not support the use of daily, low dose oral vitamin K administered in an effort to improve TTR.
