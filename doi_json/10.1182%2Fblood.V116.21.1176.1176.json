    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1176 We have recently demonstrated that G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + cells (Tregs) prevent anti-CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells T cell alloreactivity in-vitro and co-transplantation of CD34+ cells and Tregs does not affect human stem cell engraftment in NOD/SCID mice (Mahmud D et al. Biol Blood Marrow Transplant, 2010). Since only a small number of Tregs can be isolated from normal peripheral blood we examined whether PBSC can be a useful source of Tregs for future clinical trials. Five leukapheresis products from healthy donors who received rh G-CSF at 10 ug/kg daily for 5 days were processed using the CliniMACS instrument (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). CliniMACS CD34 reagent was initially used to isolate CD34+ cells. To isolate Tregs a 2-step procedure was initially utilized. A cocktail of clinical grade CD14, CD8 and CD19 reagents was mixed with the CD34- cells and depletion of monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and B cells was obtained by using the Depletion 2.1 program. The CD4+ cells were then enriched in Tregs by positive selection of CD25+ cells using a clinical grade CD25 reagent (Miltenyi). Because PBSC contain large amount of myeloid cells, and particularly monocytes, this clinical scale 2-step strategy was compared with a 3-step method that included an initial negative selection of CD14+ monocytes, followed by negative selection of CD8+ and CD19+ cells and a positive selection of CD25+ cells. Prior to isolation, the average proportion of CD4+CD25+ cells in PBSC was 0.77\u00b10.26% in 5 separate PBSC products. After the 2-step process the proportion of CD4+CD25+ cells was 35\u00b133% (n=3) vs 72\u00b11% after the 3-step process. Therefore, utilizing the 3-step approach a better yield of Tregs was observed (10 vs 60%). Intracellular expression of FoxP3 was on average 74% in CD4+CD25+ cells obtained with a 3-step process. Contamination of different cell subsets in the final products enriched in Tregs was largely superior following the 2-step as compared to 3-step isolation method. Contaminating monocytes were, on average, 43 vs 5.7%, and contaminating CD8 and CD19+ cells were 12 vs 1.7% and 0.9 vs 0.3%, respectively. In the two procedures using a 3-step approach the final absolute number of Tregs isolated from products containing on average 30 \u00d7 10 9 mononuclear cells, was 95 and 93 \u00d7 10 6 , respectively. These findings obtained using clinically available reagents and device, suggest that depletion of monocytes may improve the purity of Treg cell population isolated from PBSC. PBSC may represent a valuable source of Tregs for future clinical trials. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
