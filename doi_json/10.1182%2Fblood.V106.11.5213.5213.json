    "abstract_text": "The regimen including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and cyclosporine A (CsA) has been successfully used as an effective method in the prophylaxis of acute graft versus host disease. Herewith we investigated the effect of CsA, mycophenolic acid (MPA) alone or in combination with anti B7\u20131 mAb on proliferation of T lymphocytes and their possible mechanisms. The T lymphocyte reaction system was established in vitro and was detected by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation method; the expression of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 on mRNA and protein level were detected by RT-PCR and ELISA respectively. Experimental concentration of MPA (50\u03bcmol/L) and CsA(0.33\u03bcmol/L) inhibited the T lymphocyte proliferation significantly. CsA in combination with anti B7\u20131 mAb(10mg/L) had a much stronger effect on the inhibition( p <0.01). There was no difference between groups treated either with MPA or with the combination of MPA and anti B7\u20131 mAb. Both of CsA and MPA could inhibit the protein expression of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3. The protein expression of IL-2 were 99.70\u00b19.15 pg/ml, 48.19\u00b18.67pg/ml and 42.73\u00b114.64 pg/ml in groups of control, treated with CsA or MPA respectively. The protein expression of IFN-\u03b3 in the group treated with CsA or MPA decreased significantly than the control (6.81\u00b15.24 pg/ml, 7.87\u00b14.22 pg/ml vs 82.42\u00b125.55 pg/ml, p <0.05). Compared with that treated with CsA alone, The protein expression of IFN-\u03b3 in the group treated with CsA in combination with anti B7\u20131 mAb decreased significantly (0.30\u00b10.52 pg/ml vs 6.81\u00b15.24 pg/ml, p <0.05). Both of CsA and MPA increased the protein expression of IL-10. Compared with MPA alone, MPA in combination with anti B7\u20131 mAb increased significantly the expression of IL-10 (941.90\u00b156.61 pg/ml vs 770.95\u00b1126.85 pg/ml, p<0.05). The relative expression level of IL-2 mRNA (IL-2/GAPDH) and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA (IFN-\u03b3 /GAPDH) in the CsA or MPA group was significantly lower than the control (p<0.01). The relative expression level of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA in combination group of CsA with anti B7\u20131 mAb decreased even more significantly (0.38\u00b10.05 vs 0.59\u00b10.02, p <0.01). On the other hand, this combination could up-regulate IL-10 mRNA expression (1.80\u00b10.13 vs 1.38\u00b10.06, p <0.01). Combination of MPA with anti-B7\u20131 mAb showed a statistically significant increase in IL-10 mRNA expression (1.28\u00b10.06 vs 0.84\u00b10.09, p <0.01) as compared with MPA alone. In conclusion, MPA and CsA induced the changes of cytokine expressive spectrum and the Th1 and Th2 shift might be involved in the immunosuppressive effect. The combination of immunosuppressive agents, especially with anti B7\u20131 mAb had a synergic effect.",
