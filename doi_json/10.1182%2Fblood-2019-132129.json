    "abstract_text": "Background : Mutations of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication (ITD) occur in approximately in 30% of AML patients, and is considered a driver mutation that presents a high leukemic burden and confers a poor prognosis. Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor/insulin receptor substrates (IGF1R/IRS) signaling has been implicated to the malignant phenotype in myeloid neoplasms. However, how extend is the participation of IGF1R/IRS signaling in FLT3-mutated transformation is still an open question. Aims : To determine the clinical impact of IGF1R-IRS1/2 signaling component in FLT3-mutated AML patients and to investigate the therapeutic opportunity of pharmacological inhibition of IGF1R-IRS1/2 in preclinical models of FLT3-mutated AML. Material and methods : Clinical and molecular data from AML patients were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO-GSE 6891; n=406, median age 44 years) and TCGA AML study (n=173, median age 58 years). For survival analysis in FLT3-mutated patients, IGF1R , IGF2R , IRS1 and IRS2 mRNA expression levels from 150 and 49 patients from GSE6891 and TCGA patients were included, respectively. MOLM-13 and MV4;11 FLT3-mutated cell lines were submitted to FLT3 inhibitors (midostaurin and quizartinib) and/or Linsitinib (IGF1R/IR inhibitor: 0.5 to 40 \u00b5M) or NT157 (IGF1R-IRS1/2 inhibitor: 0.25 to 10 \u00b5M) until 72 hours and evaluated for cell viability (MTT), apoptosis (Annexin V/PI), proliferation (CFSE), and protein expression/activation (western blot and proteomics). Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA or Mann-Whitney. For survival analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves were compared with the log-rank test, and multivariate analysis was performed by Proportional Hazard Cox regression. Results : IGF1R , INSR , IGF1 , IGF2 , IRS1 , and IRS2 were all downregulated in FLT3-mutated in comparison with wild-type in both AML cohorts (all P5\u00b5M) and NT157 (>0.5 \u00b5M) significantly induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines (all P2.5 \u00b5M) and NT157 (>0.5 \u00b5M) significantly reduced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent-manner. Linsitinib and NT157 inhibited IGF1R and IRS1/2 activation, as well as its related signaling pathways as demonstrated by reduced activation/expression of FLT3 (Y591), AKT1/2/3 (S473), mTOR (S2448), STAT5 (Y694). Linsitinb acted as a cytostatic drug by inducing autophagy, as determined by mTORC1 inhibition and mTORC2 activation, as well as p62 degradation and LC3B-I conversion into LC3BII. NT157 was more cytotoxic activating AP-1 system, as evidenced by p-JNK/SAPK and P38 MAPK and more prominent cleavage of CASP3 and PARP1 and reducing BCL-xL expression. A better characterization of the molecular context of IGF1R-IRS1/2 pharmacological inhibition will be allowed by proteomic of total extract of MOLM13 and MV4;11 cells treated with linsitinb (10 \u00b5M) or NT157 (1 \u00b5M) that will be presented at the meeting. Midostaurin \u22652.5 nM and quizartinib \u22650.5 nM treatment abolished IGF1R activation and IRS1 and IRS2 expression, as well as induced autophagy as demonstrated by the degradation of p62 and accumulation of Beclin 1. Conclusion : In FLT3-mutated AML, expression of IGF1R-IRS1/2 signaling components are deregulated and high IGF1R expression predicted dismal prognosis. Pharmacological inhibition of IGF1R-IRS1/2 exerted antineoplastic activity in cellular models and arises as a promising therapeutic target for FLT3-mutated AML patients.
