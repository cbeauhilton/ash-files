    "abstract_text": "The use of cytokines as agents to augment immune responses against malignancies have been dealt setbacks due to immune selection of tumors, resulting in subpopulations that elaborate tumor-derived soluble factors, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), which suppress immune effector functions. TGF-\u03b2 is overexpressed by many solid and hematological malignancies and is well known to inhibit the proliferation and anti-tumor functions of lymphomyeloid cells. In order to maximize cytokine-based immunotherapy against tumors, we have designed a novel fusion protein consisting of proinflammatory murine interleukin-15 (IL-15) linked to the sushi domain of the IL-15R\u03b1 chain (IL15R\u03b1 sushi +IL15) fused in frame to the C'-terminus of a dimeric murine TGF-\u03b2-receptor (type II, T\u03b2RII) ectodomain-based ligand trap, termed FIST-15 (Fusion of Interleukin 15 with Sushi to TGF-\u03b2 receptor). The rationale for the design of this protein is to prevent tumor-derived TGF-\u03b2 from suppressing the immune response via the TGF-\u03b2 ligand trap moiety, while simultaneously providing a potent stimulus for the activation of anti-tumor responses by an IL-15R agonist (IL-15R\u03b1 sushi +IL15). FIST-15 can neutralize TGF-\u03b2 induced Smad signaling, and induce STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation by immunoblot and intracellular flow cytometric analysis of lymphocytes, suggesting that both protein domains are biochemically active. Functionally, FIST-15 is able to induce CD8+ T-cell proliferation at rates greater than IL-15 alone (CD8+ T-cell replicative index or fold-expansion of responding cells: 40, FIST-15, vs. 10, IL-15; p-value of unpaired T-test <0.05). The mitogenic effects of IL-15 are abrogated in CD8+ T-cells and NK cells in the presence of TGF-\u03b2. However, FIST-15 can overcome TGF-\u03b2 mediated inhibition in both these cellular subsets (CD8+ T-cell replicative index: 20, FIST-15, vs. 5, IL-15, and NK cell replicative index: 40, FIST-15 vs. 5, IL-15; p-value <0.05). Rapid proliferation of the CD8+ central memory phenotype (CD62L+, CD44+) T-cells are seen with FIST-15 treatment. Compared to IL-15 expanded CD8+ T-cells, FIST-15 treatment also produced more IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2 secreting CD8+ T-cells upon PMA/ionomycin stimulation. In addition to cytokines, production of anti-tumor effector molecules such as granzyme B is known to be inhibited by TGF-\u03b2. FIST-15 treated NK cells were superior to IL-15 treated NK cells in granzyme B production, even in the presence of TGF-\u03b2, as assayed by flow cytometric analysis (86.8% vs. 30.7% granzyme B expressing cells). Functionally, FIST-15 treated NK cells were also significantly more cytolytic against TGF-\u03b2 secreting B16 murine melanoma cells in vitro compared to IL-15 treated NK cells (83.5% killing, FIST-15, vs. 24.4% killing, IL-15). C57Bl/6 mice with pre-established, syngeneic B16 melanoma tumors were treated with FIST-15 to assay the anti-tumor effects of the fusion protein in vivo . Mice receiving FIST-15 showed a significant delay in tumor growth (mean tumor volume: 345mm 3 ) compared to control mice receiving conditioned media (mean tumor volume: 814.12mm 3 ; p-value of paired T-test = 0.02) by day 21 post-tumor implantation. Furthermore, FIST-15 treated mice showed a significant survival advantage compared to control treated mice (80% vs 0%; p-value of log rank test = 0.0019) by day 27 post-tumor implantation. Mice immunized with B16 tumors transduced to express FIST-15 were also protected against subsequent wildtype B16 tumor challenge, suggesting that FIST-15 can trigger an adaptive immune response against tumor. Ongoing work utilizing FIST-15 in murine models of hematological malignancies, such as EL-4 lymphoma and C1498 AML, is currently underway. These models were selected due to their known overexpression of TGF-\u03b2 isoforms that systemically inhibit endogenous anti-tumor responses, as well as the efficacy of immunotherapeutic agents. Indeed, many hematological malignancies acquire mutations that render them insensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-\u03b2, where it may then be overexpressed as an oncogene to promote further tumor growth by inhibiting the immune system's anti-tumor capabilities (Dong et al Blood 2006). FIST-15 may present a viable immunotherapeutic strategy for hematological malignancies by combining the immune activating effects of IL-15 with the neutralization of immunosuppressive TGF-\u03b2.
