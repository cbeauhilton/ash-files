    "abstract_text": "The MALT1/MLT gene codes for a human paracaspase and plays a crucial role in NF-\u03baB activation in response to TCR induction. Rearrangements of MALT1/MLT by the translocations t(11;18)(q21;q21) and t(14;18)(q32;q21) act by activating the NF-\u03baB pathway and are the most frequent structural chromosomal abnormalities in extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of the MALT-type. They occur in 20 to 50% of low grade MALT lymphomas, but with only rare exception are absent in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). By screening 118 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 28 Burkitt\u2019s lymphomas by interphase FISH with probes flanking MALT1/MLT (Abbott Vysis), we found two cases with a break within MALT1/MLT . Further experiments with plasmid subclones from the BAM H1 fragments of PAC 152M5, which spans the entire coding region of MALT1/MLT , confirmed the break within MALT1/MLT in one case. This patient presented with a relapse of a DLBCL, centroblastic subtype, without any concomitant low-grade component or lymphoepithelial lesions. During relapse only nodal manifestations were seen (stage IIIA), however, at the time of primary diagnosis a lymphoma infiltration of one adrenal gland was present. FISH experiments with MALT1/MLT , API2 and IGH specific probes did not identify a t(11;18) or a t(14;18). 3\u2032 RACE-PCR revealed a novel in frame fusion of exon 9 of the MALT1/MLT gene and exon 9 of the microtubule-associated protein 4 ( MAP4 ) gene. RT-PCR with specific primers for MALT1/MLT and MAP4 confirmed the presence of the fusion transcript MALT1/MLT-MAP4 . In addition, interphase FISH showed that the translocation was accompanied by a deletion of MALT1/MLT sequences distal to the breakpoint including the caspase-like domain, which is essential for activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway in MALT lymphomas. Corresponding to this result, 5\u2032 RACE-PCR with specific primers for MALT1/MLT and RT-PCR with nested primers for MAP4 and MALT1/MLT did not detect the reciprocal 5\u2032 MAP4 -3\u2032 MALT1/MLT transcript. The MAP4 gene on chromosome 3p21 is the major microtubule-associated protein in non-neuronal tissues and promotes microtubule polymerization. Disruption of the microtubule-dynamics is induced by microtubule-interfering drugs, such as taxanes and Vinca alkaloids. We conclude that the 5\u2032 MALT1/MLT -3\u2032 MAP4 fusion is the pathogenetically relevant transcript in this non-reciprocal der(18)t(3;18)(p21;q21) translocation. The absence of the caspase like domain distinguishes this novel gene fusion, MALT1/MLT-MAP4 , from the API2-MALT1/MLT in the t(11;18) and the IGH-MALT1/MLT in the t(14;18), in which the caspase like domain is invariably present and points to MAP4 as a new target gene with possible therapeutic implications in DLBCL.",
