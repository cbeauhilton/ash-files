    "abstract_text": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a frequent complication of sickle cell anemia (SCA) and is a predictor of early mortality. To determine the predictors of deteriorating kidney function in SCA, we followed 164 patients treated at the University of Illinois at Chicago for a median of 32 months (range 3-88 months). Steady-state estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR), albuminuria, and hemoglobinuria assessments were obtained at baseline and during the follow-up period. Steady-state was defined as greater than four weeks from a vaso-occlusive pain episode or a red blood cell transfusion. Hemoglobinuria was defined as positive for blood on dipstick and < 2 red blood cells on microscopy. Fifty-six (34%) of the patients had hemoglobinuria at baseline. We confirmed in a subset of 43 patients that dipstick positive hemoglobinuria (n=17) was associated with higher urine cell-free hemoglobin concentrations determined by ELISA than dipstick negative urine (n=26) (23.1 vs. 11.5 ng/mL, p<0.0001) ( Figure 1 ). Age and mean arterial blood pressures were similar in patients with hemoglobinuria at baseline compared to those without but markers of hemolysis were higher (LDH, indirect bilirubin, AST, and reticulocyte percentage; p<0.0001). Sixty-one percent (95%CI: 48-73%) of patients with hemoglobinuria at baseline had hemoglobinuria at most recent follow up compared to 9% (95%CI: 5-18%) of patients without hemoglobinuria at baseline (p<0.0001). The proportion of patients with CKD progression defined by a 50% reduction in eGFR calculated by the CKD-EPI formula or requirement for hemodialysis or kidney transplant was higher in patients with baseline hemoglobinuria (13%, 7/56) versus without hemoglobinuria (1%, 1/108) (HR 14, 95%CI: 2-113; logrank p=0.001) ( Figure 2 ). Progression of albuminuria category from normoalbuminuria (albuminuria < 30mg/g creatinine) to either microalbuminuria (albuminuria = 30-300 mg/g creatinine) or macroalbuminuria (albuminuria > 300mg/g creatinine) or microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria was also higher in patients with baseline hemoglobinuria (42%, 11/26) versus without hemoglobinuria (13%, 9/67) (HR 3.1, 95%CI: 1.3-7.7; logrank p=0.004) ( Figure 3 ). In conclusion, hemoglobinuria determined by urinalysis at steady-state is a valid assessment of increased urine cell-free hemoglobin concentration and is fairly consistent on repeat testing at steady-state visits. The presence of hemoglobinuria is significantly associated with a greater risk for progression of CKD and albuminuria. Our findings are consistent with the possibility that cell-free hemoglobin contributes to the progression of kidney disease in SCA. Further research including measures to decrease cell-free hemoglobin exposure to preserve kidney function are warranted.
