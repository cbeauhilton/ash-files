    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1162 Poster Board I-184 Backgrounds Umbilical cord blood can be an alternative stem cell source for the patients of hematological diseases. However, little is known about chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and graft versus leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effect in reduced-intensity cord blood transplantation (RICBT). We had been demonstrated that cGVHD in CBT is tolerable compared with that in BMT and that the occurrence of cGVHD could result in good prognosis. Here, we analyzed the clinical picture of chronic GVHD following RICBT and the GVL effect. Methods We reviewed medical records of 192 patients with hematological diseases who had received CBT between Jan. 2004 and Dec. 2008 who had been free from disease progression for more than 100 days after RICBT at Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. Median age was 54 years (17-82). Most of them had diseases in advanced status (n=168). Most of the pre-transplant conditioning were reduced intensity consisted of fludarabine, melphalan and TBI 4Gy (n=157). GVHD prophylaxis were tacrolimus (Tac) alone (n=99) and Tac plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (n=93). HLA disparities were as follows; 6/6 (n=9), 5/6 (n=38), 4/6 (n=142), and 3/6 (n=3). Underlying diseases were AML (n=58), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=36), ALL (n=23), lymphoma (n=64) and others (n=11). Results The Median observation period after the transplantation was 924 days (range, 109\u20131944). Chronic GVHD was admitted in 114 patients (59.4%) consisted of limited type 88 (45.8%) and extensive type 26 (13.5%) in classical criteria, and mild type 96 (50.0%), moderate type 15 (7.8%), and severe type 3 (1.6%) in NIH consensus criteria of cGVHD. The target organs of cGVHD were skin 87.5%, liver 40.6%, and mouth mucous membranes 32.8 %, eye 23.4%, and the lungs only 7.8% (COP3 and BOS2). Except 21 cases ( 10.9%) required systemic steroid or MMF therapy. The median of Karnofsky score of cGVHD was 90%(40-100). During observation period, no patients except one patient caused by heart failure were died of cGVHD. In multivariate analysis, high-risk disease (p=0.019) and preceding acute GVHD (p=0.026) are related to the occurrence of cGVHD, and cGVHD increased overall survival (p<0.01) and suppressed recurrence of the disease (p<0.01). Conclusion Although the frequency of cGVHD was not low, the severity was mild, and the death related to cGVHD is rare in RICBT. NIH consensus criteria is useful for the evaluation of cGVHD severity. Some effect of GVL may play a role on better survival and lower relapse rate in RICBT. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
