    "abstract_text": "Introduction. Myelofibrosis (MF), an acquired clonal disorder of the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) with a dysregulation in JAK/STAT signalling (mutations in JAK2, MPL and Calreticulin (CALR) genes), is characterized by a state of chronic inflammation. It is argued that the up-regulated production of proinflammatory cytokines by both HSPCs and the surrounding stromal cells generates a microenvironment that selects for the malignant clone. Only recently, it has been hypothesized that the sustained inflammatory microenvironment of MF can alter crucial biological processes, leading to genomic instability and cancer progression. Here we tested the in vitro functional effects of pivotal players of the inflammatory microenvironment (the extracellular ATP nucleotide and selected cytokines, such as Interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-\u03b1 or the Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1)) on the HSPCs from MF patients. Methods: Circulating CD34 + /CD34 + CD38- cells from MF patients (JAK2V617F (17 cases) and CALR (9 cases) mutations) or cord blood (CB; 8 samples) were phenotypically and functionally characterized after in vitro incubation with or without ATP (1000 \u03bcM), IL-1\u03b2 (10 ng/mL), TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/mL) or TIMP-1 (100 ng/mL) (alone or in combination). Cells were then analyzed for survival/apoptosis (Annexin-V/Propidium Iodide staining), phenotype (evaluation of CD63 (TIMP-1 receptor), CXCR4 and CD38 expression), cell cycle and clonogenic capacity. Migration was assessed first towards a CXCL12 gradient in the presence or absence of the pro-inflammatory factors. In parallel experiments, CD34 + cells from MF patients were co-cultured with normal mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the presence or absence of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and then evaluated for their ability to migrate towards a CXCL12 gradient. Plasma TIMP-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and CXCL12 were measured by ELISA assay. Results: The plasma levels of TIMP-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, CXCL12 and the number of circulating CD34 + , CD34 + CD38 - , CD34 + CD63 + , CD34 + CD184 + cells were increased in MF patients. According to mutational status, the CD34 + CD63 + cells were higher in the CALR + patients. The survival of MF CD34 + cells was strongly stimulated by in vitro incubation with TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 as compared with the CB-derived CD34 + cells or untreated cells. By multiple cytokine combinations, IL-1\u03b2/TIMP-1, IL-1\u03b2 /ATP or IL-1\u03b2 /TNF-\u03b1 treatments significantly promote the survival of MF CD34 + cells as compared with the normal counterparts or the untreated cells. Various combinations with IL-1\u03b2 were also effective in stimulating survival of CD34+CD38- cells. IL-1\u03b2/TIMP-1 and IL-1\u03b2/TNF-\u03b1/TIMP-1, but not factors alone, significantly increased the CFU-C growth of MF patients as compared with the CB-derived counterparts and the untreated cells. Moreover, comparing CALR+ vs JAK2V617F+ patients, the colony formation of JAK2V617F+ patients was mainly promoted by the IL-1\u03b2/TNF-\u03b1 treatment. Along with clonogenic capacity stimulation, exposure of CD34+ cells from MF patients to IL-1\u03b2/TNF-\u03b1/TIMP-1 significantly increases the S-phase cells, suggesting that these pro-inflammatory factors stimulated cell-cycle progression in dormant CD34+ MF cells. Migration of CD34+ cells from MF was significantly increased in CXCL12 treated cells. In addition, exposure of MF CD34+ cells to IL-1\u03b2/TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2/TIMP-1 or IL-1\u03b2/TNF-\u03b1/TIMP-1 significantly promotes cell migration in comparison with the CB-derived counterparts or SDF-1 alone. MF migrated cells in the presence of IL-1\u03b2/TNF-\u03b1 significantly upregulate CD63 expression. Intriguingly, colony formation of MF migrated CD34+ cells in the presence of IL-1\u03b2/TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2/TNF-\u03b1/TIMP-1 was potently increased. Finally, co-culture systems with normal MSCs in the presence of pro-inflammatory factors revealed that MF CD34+ cells display increased migration ability toward CXCL12 gradient. Conclusions: Altogether our findings suggest that in MF the inflammatory niche plays a key role in the maintenance of the malignant clone. Thus, the interplay between the pro-inflammatory cytokines promote and select the HSPCs with higher proliferative activity, clonogenic potential and migration capability. Targeting these microenvironmental interactions may be a clinically relevant approach.
