    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3537 Donor-recipient HLA mismatches are associated with increased morbidity and mortality after UD hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT). We hypothesized that HLA-DP mismatches would worsen outcomes of HSCT using donors mismatched at HLA-A,-B,-C,-DRB1 or -DQB1 and evaluated 391 consecutive patients (pts) with myeloid malignancies treated at our institution with 0,1,2,3 mismatches out of 12 alleles typed by high resolution at HLA-A,-B,-C,-DR,-DQ,-DP loci. Eighty-one pts were 12/12, 180 pts were 11/12, 113 pts were 10/12, and 15 pts were 9/12 HLA match with the recipients. Characteristics of the 4 groups (12/12, 11/12, 10/12, 9/12) were similar except source of stem cells; 87% of pts with 9/12 donors received bone marrow versus 60\u201362% for the other 3 groups. Results: Two-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 40%, 44%, 45%, 53% and 33%, 40%, 44%, 49%, respectively (p=NS). However, OS was significantly worse with increasing number of mismatches for patients with AML/MDS with poor-risk cytogenetics (p=0.005, HR 1.6, 95% CI 2.1\u20134.2). Except for the 9/12 group, pts had a significantly higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) (11%, 24%, 36%) and lower risk of progression (32%, 25%, 20%). In the 9/12 group, NRM was 27% and progression rate was 40%. Grade II-IV, III-IV aGVHD as well as cGVHD were also progressively worse with increasing number of mismatches. Gr II-IV and III-IV aGVHD rates were 35%, 37%, 41%, 69%, and 8%, 8%, 15%, 16%, respectively. Cumulative incidence of cGVHD was 35%, 39%, 44% and 61%, respectively. Compared with 11\u201312/12 donors, pts who received a 9\u201310/12 donor had significantly higher rates of gr III-IV aGVHD and cGVHD (p=0.03, HR 2.1, CI 1.1\u20133.7 and p=0.02, HR 1.5, CI 1.1\u20132.1, respectively). Univariate analysis revealed that there is less NRM with a 12/12 donor (vs. other) (p=0.008, HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2\u20132.9), while in multivariate analysis, compared with a 12/12 donor, the use of a donor with mismatch was significantly associated with higher NRM [HR and 95%CI were 2.1 and 1.04\u20134.4 for 11/12 donor (p=0.04); 3.1 and 1.5\u20133.3 for 10/12 donor (p=0.003); 2.8 and 0.9\u20139.3 for a 9/12 donor (p=0.08), respectively] ( Figure ). In multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with OS were disease status at transplant (active disease vs. not) (p<0.001), cytogenetics for AML/MDS pts (poor-risk vs. other) (p=0.006, HR) and the use of fludarabine and busulfan conditioning (Bu 130mg/m2 \u00d7 4 days and Flu vs. other) (p=0.04, HR 0.7, CI 0.5\u20130.98), while factors significantly associated with NRM were, in addition to degree of mismatch, disease status at transplant (p=0.008, HR 1.9, CI 1.2\u20133.1) and use of BuFlu conditioning (p=0.004, HR 0.5, CI 0.4\u20130.8).

Matching at DP loci appears to be protective of NRM and is associated with improved survival for patients with AML/MDS with poor-risk cytogenetics.
