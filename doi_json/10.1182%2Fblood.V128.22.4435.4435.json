    "abstract_text": "Epigenetic regulation mechanisms - such as histone marks, DNA methylation and miRNA - are often misregulated in cancers and are associated with tumorigenesis and drug resistance. Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disease that accumulates within the bone marrow. Epigenetic modifications in MM are associated not only with cancer development and progression, but also with resistance to chemotherapy. This epigenetic plasticity can be targeted with epidrugs, nowadays used in treatment of several cancers. We recently identified a significant overexpression of the lysine histone methyltransferase SETD8 in MM cells (HMCLs; N=40) compared with normal plasma cells (N=5) ( P <0.001). SETD8 (also known as SET8, PR-Set7, KMT5A) is the sole enzyme responsible for the monomethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me1) which has been linked to chromatin compaction and cell-cycle regulation. In addition, SETD8 induces the methylation of non-histone proteins, such as the replication factor PCNA, the tumor suppressor P53 and its stabilizing protein Numb. While SETD8-mediated methylation of P53 and Numb inhibits apoptosis, PCNA methylation upon SETD8 enhances the interaction with the Flap endonuclease FEN1 and promotes cancer cell proliferation. SETD8 is also implicated in DNA damage response, helping 53BP1 recruitment at DNA double-strand breaks. Consistent with this, overexpression of SETD8 is found in various types of cancer and has been directly implicated in breast cancer invasiveness and metastasis. A role of SETD8 in development of MM has however never been described. We found that high SETD8 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in 2 independent cohorts of newly diagnosed patients (UAMS-TT2 cohort - N=345 and UAMS-TT3 cohort - N=158). Specific SETD8 inhibition with UNC-0379 inhibitor, causing its degradation and H4K20me1 depletion, leads to significant growth inhibition of HMCLs (N=10) and the murine cell lines 5T33MM and 5TGM1. MM cells treated with UNC-0379 presented a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest after 24h of treatment, followed by apoptosis 48h later. To confirm that SETD8 inhibition is as efficient on primary MM cells from patients, primary MM cells (N=8) were co-cultured with their bone marrow microenvironment and recombinant IL-6 and treated for 4 days with UNC-0379. Interestingly, treatment of MM patient samples with UNC-0379 reduces the percentage of myeloma cells (65%; P <0.005) without significantly affecting the non-myeloma cells, suggesting a specific addiction of primary myeloma cells to SETD8 activity. Melphalan is an alkylating agent commonly used in MM treatment. As SETD8 is known to be involved in the DNA damage response, we investigated the effect of its combination with Melphalan on HMCLs. Results show that this particular drug combination strongly enhances double strand breaks in HMCLs monitored using 53BP1 foci formation and gH2AX detection. This result emphasizes a potential role of SETD8 in DNA repair in MM cells. Furthermore, GSEA analysis of patients with high SETD8 expression highlighted a significant enrichment of genes involved in DNA repair, MYC-MAX targets and MAPK pathway. Our study is the first to demonstrate the importance of SETD8 for MM cells survival and suggest that SETD8 inhibition represent a promising strategy to improve conventional treatment of MM with DNA damaging agents.
