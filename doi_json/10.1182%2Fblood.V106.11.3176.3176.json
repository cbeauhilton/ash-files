    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell anemia (SS) is a phenotypically variable disease whose course is difficult to predict. The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) found that dactylitis in the 1st year of life predicted adverse outcomes in later childhood. We aimed to determine whether early vaso-occlusive complications, including dactylitis, were prognostic in the Dallas Newborn Cohort. We studied all cohort members with SS or sickle-\u03b2 0 -thalassemia who were 0.99) or have a stroke (12.2 vs. 10.3%; P=0.69). However, the use of a disease-modifying therapy was more common among subjects who had early pain (37.7 vs. 19.9%; P=0.01) and ACS (37.6 vs. 16.2%; P0.99). This prediction held only for HU use when the treatments (HU, CT, or SCT) were analyzed separately. Subjects who experienced early pain or ACS had on average a 2.2-fold (P=0.02) or 2.1-fold (P=0.01), respectively, higher number of late pain crises between ages 3 and 11, but not beyond (all P>0.05). Dactylitis did not predict a higher number of late painful events at any age (all P>0.05). Likewise, neither early pain nor dactylitis was associated with a higher number of hospitalizations for late ACS (all P>0.05). However, subjects who had early ACS had a 1.7 to 3.6-fold higher mean number of ACS events throughout all late age groups (all P<0.05). In summary, early hospitalization for pain, dactylitis, or ACS did not predict death or stroke. Early pain and ACS were associated with use of HU in later childhood, but not CT or SCT. Early pain and ACS predicted an increased number of hospitalizations for pain until age 11, but not beyond. Early ACS was a strong predictor of recurrent ACS throughout childhood. Notably, we found that hospitalization for dactylitis had no particular prognostic significance, unlike the CSSCD. In conclusion, the prognostic significance of early vaso-occlusive complications is limited.",
