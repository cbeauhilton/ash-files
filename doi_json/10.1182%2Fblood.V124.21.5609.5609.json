    "abstract_text": "The prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is critically determined by cytogenetic abnormalities. In this study, we assessed the impact of the IPSS-R cytogenetic score (C-IPSS-R) on the outcome of 367 patients with MDS transplanted from HLA-identical siblings or HLA allele-matched unrelated donors. According to the C-IPSS-R 178 patients (48%) fell in the good risk, 102 (28%) in the intermediate risk, 77 (21%) in the poor risk and 10 (3%) in the very poor risk group. In multivariate analysis, the poor and very poor-risk categories correlated with shorter overall survival (HR = 1.59, P = 0.009 and HR = 3.18, P = 0.002, respectively) and higher relapse rates (HR = 1.82, P = 0.004 and HR = 2.44, P = 0.060, respectively), after a median follow-up of 4 years. Overall, the C-IPSS-R changed the IPSS cytogenetic risk only in 8% of cases but identified a new risk group with dismal prognosis. These findings urge the investigation of new post-transplant therapeutic approaches for patients with very poor C-IPSS-R karyotypes, including maintenance therapy.
