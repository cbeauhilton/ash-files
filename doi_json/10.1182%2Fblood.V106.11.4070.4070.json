    "abstract_text": "Objective: To study significance and character of fibrinolytic system in pleural and ascitic fluid with three disease. Methods: Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), urokinase plaminogen activator receptor (uPAR) were measured by ELISA, tissue plaminogen activator (tPA), plaminogen activator inhibitor-1(PAI-1), plasminogen (Plg), plasmin (Pl), and a 2 plasmin inhibitor (a 2 PI) by colorimetric assay. Result: The levels of uPA and uPAR in pleural and ascitic fluid were marked higher in malignant tumor (2533.42\u00b11369.89 ng/L and 7.32\u00b11.59\u03bcg/L) and tuberculosis (2618.05\u00b11542.50 ng/L, 8.75\u00b13.48\u03bcg/L)than in cirrrhosis (961.25 \u00b1 692.82ng/L and 2.73\u00b11.59 \u03bcg/L, P <0.01). The level of tPA was marked higher in cirrhosis (353.75\u00b1142.31 IU/L) and malignant tumor (341.16\u00b1136.46 IU/L) than in tuberculosis(266.45\u00b143.70 IU/L, P <0.01). The levels of PAI-1, Plg and Pl were in order of quantity tuberculosis(828.02\u00b1217.02 AU/L, 5.17\u00b11.51 IU/ml and 65.52\u00b125.22%), malignant tumor (540.35\u00b1217.52 AU/L, 3.90\u00b11.25 IU/ml and 49.52\u00b114.27%), cirrhosis (337.88\u00b1162.03 AU/L, 1.88\u00b10.51 IU/ml and 26.04\u00b18.45%). There were significant difference among them ( P <0.01). The level of a 2 PI was marked higher in malignant tumor (82.38\u00b128.68%) and cirrhosis (91.75\u00b124.73%) than in tuberculosis (61.62\u00b127.67%, P <0.05). Among seven targets in malignant tumor group, only the level of uPA was significant difference between positive group in pleural and ascitic fluid with cancer cell (3073.44\u00b11161.93\u03bcg/L) and negative group without cancer cell (1453.38\u00b11128.39\u03bcg/L, P <0.01). Conclusions: There were significant difference in fibrinolytic charater in pleural and ascitic fluid with different diseases. To join test with fibrinolysis targets can not only help determine quality of pleural and ascitic fluid, but also can help deeply understand pathologic processes in desease, especially some biologic actions of malignant tumor.",
