    "abstract_text": "Objective To evaluate the outcomes of unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) for severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Methods The clinical data of 18 SAA patients, including 9 very severe aplastic anemia (vSAA), received UCBT from Sep 2009 to Feb 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Three patients received a single unrelated cord blood unit, fifteen patients received double unrelated cord blood units. One patient was 4/6 HLA match, nine patients were 5/6 HLA match, eight patients were 6/6 HLA match. The conditioning regimens were as follow: 1 patient received modified BU/CY- based regimen, 1 patient received fludarabine (Flu) + antithymocyte globulin (ATG) + cyclophosphamide (CY) + total body irradiation (TBI) regimen, 16 patients received fludarabine (Flu) + antithymocyte globulin (ATG) + cyclophosphamide (CY) regimens. Prophylaxis for graft-versus host disease (GVHD): cyclosporine (CsA) plus short-term methotrexate (MTX). Results There was1 patient early death on day +2, 6 patients experienced primary graft rejection, but 5 of them acquired autologous myeloid recovery, 11 patients were engrafted successfully. The median days of neutrophils(ANC)above 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L and platelets (PLT) more than 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L were 18.5(9~29)days and 26.5(20~48)days, respectively. Six patients (54.5%) developed acute GVHD (aGVHD), 1 for grade I aGVHD, 3 for grade \u2161 aGVHD, 2 for grade \u2163 aGVHD. Of 9 patients, 2 occurred chronic GVHD (cGVHD), 1 for mild cGVHD, 1 for severe cGVHD. After a median follow-up of 56(4 \u223c 72)months, 9 patients (50.0%) died, out of which one died of severe aGVHD, the reasons of death were GVHD, severe infection, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) and transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). The 5-year estimated overall survival was 46.9% \u00b1 12.3%. No patient relapsed. Conclusion UCBT is an effective therapy for SAA patients who lack an appropriate matched related donor.
