    "abstract_text": "Abstract 260 Platelet \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin undergoes structural rearrangements to increase the affinity for ligands. Two major changes in integrin three-dimensional structure are critical for this activation process. One is the straightening of integrin legs (extension), and the other is the swing out movement of the \u03b23 hybrid domain (swing-out). In this study, we have found that this structural requirement for activation differs depending upon the divalent cations present. We previously reported that the swing-out-defective mutant \u03b1IIbD319C/\u03b23V359C did not bind fibrinogen in the presence of Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ . However, the same mutant bound fibrinogen in the presence of Mn 2+ , when activated by monoclonal antibody PT25-2 or by forcing the integrin legs to extend by concomitant \u03b1IIbQ595NTT mutation. We engineered another mutation that was designed specifically to prevent the swing-out. Likewise, this \u03b23G327C/\u03b23V419C mutation blocked fibrinogen binding in the presence of Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ , but not in the presence of Mn 2+ . On the other hand, when integrin extension was specifically prevented by \u03b1IIbD464C/\u03b1IIbS728C mutation, fibrinogen binding was observed neither in the presence of Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ nor in Mn 2+ . Thus, swing-out is not essential for activation in Mn 2+ , as long as integrin legs are in extended state, while both swing-out and extension are required in Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ . To explore the underlying mechanism originating this difference, three distinct cation-binding sites in the \u03b2A domain were mutated. Among the three sites, MIDAS is occupied by Mg 2+ , while ADMIDAS and LIMBS/SyMBS are occupied by Ca 2+ in Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ condition. When amino acid residues composing these sites were mutated to Ala, none of them bound fibrinogen, except for D126A and D127A in the presence of Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ . Notably, these mutations restored fibrinogen binding in the swing-out-defective mutant. Amino acid residues D126 and D127 compose ADMIDAS together with S123 and M335. Swing-out of the hybrid domain disrupts M335 from ADMIDAS. This allows Ca 2+ to move toward MIDAS, bringing the \u03b21-\u03b11 loop closer to ligand to provide contact site. However, similar rearrangement of the cation/ligand binding sites has been shown to take place in Mn 2+ without the swing-out. The results suggest partial disruption of ADMIDAS is the key event for activation in Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ , while it is not so in Mn 2+ . Our results may reconcile the dispute over the apparently contradicting findings in the crystal structure that integrin with a closed head with Mn 2+ represents an active conformation as one with an open head with Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ .
