    "abstract_text": "Background: The minimal or measurable residual disease (MRD) status post induction-consolidation is widely accepted as major surrogate endpoint that correlates with outcome in adult patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the optimal time-points of MRD assessment at complete remission (CR) or later during consolidation and its impact on outcome remain unclear. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 419 newly diagnosed adult patients with Philadelphia negative B-cell ALL who received treatment at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 01/2000 and 01/2015 (Figure 1). Overall, 394 of 419 (94%) patients achieved CR. Two hundred and fifteen patients (51%) had available MRD assessment (by multicolor flow cytometry) at CR (1st time-point: median 24 days) and first post-CR MRD assessment (2nd time-point: median 3.6 months), and constitute the current studied cohort. MRD responses were stratified as MRD negative (undetectable), low-positive (\u22640.1%), and high-positive (>0.1%). Results: The median age for the study cohort (n=215) was 37 years (range 15-86), and 17% (n=37) had unfavorable cytogenetic profile, such as complex karyotype (n=9), KMT2A ( MLL ) rearrangement (n=14), and low hypodiploidy/near triploidy (n=14) (Table 1). At first time-point (1TP), 148 patients (68%) were MRD negative and 67 (32%) were positive (Figure 2). Of the 148 patients with negative MRD at 1TP, 147 (99%) maintained it through second time-point (2TP). Fourteen of 16 (88%) patients with low-positive MRD and 33 of 51 (64%) with high-positive MRD at 1TP became MRD negative at 2TP. Patients who were MRD negative at both time-points, early MRD responders, had the 3-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of 65% and 76%, respectively (Table 2). Patients with improved MRD status from positive to negative, late MRD responders, had lower 3-year EFS and OS rates, 42% and 58%, respectively (Figure 3, p<0.01). The 3-year EFS and OS rates were the lowest (16% and 49%, respectively) in patients with persistent MRD at both time points (p<0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that older age, KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement, and MRD positivity at 1TP only correlated with worse survival (Table 3). Conclusion: The early achievement of MRD negative CR is a strong predictive for survival. Innovative combinations of conventional chemotherapy and targeted agents that induce early MRD eradication may have the potential to improve cure rates in adult ALL.
