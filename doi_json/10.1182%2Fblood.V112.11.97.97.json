    "abstract_text": "Background: The recent discovery of JAK2 V617F, as an activating mutation in the majority of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, has spurred development of JAK2-selective small molecule inhibitors for the treatment of these diseases. TG101348 is a potent (enzyme IC 50 =3 nM) and selective (35- and 334-fold selectivity over JAK1 and JAK3, respectively) orally bioavailable JAK2 inhibitor that is effective in treating a murine model of Polycythemia vera (PV) ( Cancer Cell. 2008 13:311). TG101348 selectively inhibits growth of hematopoietic colonies harboring V617F, MPLW515K, or JAK2 exon 12 mutations (Leukemia. 2008 Mar 20, Epub). Methods: A Phase I dose-escalation study of TG101348 is ongoing for patients with high- or intermediate-risk (with symptomatic disease) primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and post-PV or post-essential thrombocythemia (ET) myelofibrosis ( Cancer.  2007  109 : 2083 ). TG101348 was administered orally once daily in 28-day cycles in cohorts of at least 3 patients. Additional eligibility criteria included absolute neutrophil count of \u22651 \u00d7 10 9 /L and platelet count of \u226550 \u00d7 10 9 /L, but a JAK2 mutation was not required. Primary objectives were determination of safety and tolerability, as well as pharmacokinetic behavior of TG101348. The secondary objectives were evaluation of treatment response ( Blood.  2006  108 : 1497 ), pharmacodynamic activity, and drug effect on V617F allele burden and plasma cytokine levels. The spleen response was documented as change in palpable spleen tip from the costal margin. For patients achieving less than a complete remission after 3 cycles of treatment at their initial dose, step-wise escalation was permitted at each cycle if a cohort had been shown to have tolerated that dose. Results: Fifteen patients (9 males; median age=66 years; range=53 to 79 years) have been enrolled in the study to date \u2013 10 with PMF (8 V617F+) and 5 with post-PV MF (all V617F+). The median follow-up to date is 13 weeks (range 1\u201328). Treatment was discontinued in 1 patient, in cohort 1, on the 2 nd day of dosing after it was discovered that the patient had baseline QTcF prolongation (Grade 1). In the remaining 14 patients, no dose-limiting toxicities or other significant non-hematological adverse events have been observed to date. The pharmacokinetic parameters of TG101348 in plasma were well characterized following single daily oral doses of 30 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg or 240 mg. Dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were observed following single and multiple doses of TG101348. Treatment response data are as follows: Cohort 1 (starting dose=30 mg; 3 patients; median follow-up=26 weeks): 2 of the 3 patients had improvement in constitutional symptoms including fatigue, night sweats and pruritus. No other benefits were noted. These patients have now been dose escalated to either 120 or 240 mg/day. Cohort 2 (starting dose=60 mg; 3 patients; median follow-up=18 weeks): 1 patient had a 40% decrease in spleen size (18 to 10 cm). All 3 patients have now been dose escalated to 120 or 240 mg/day. Cohort 3 (starting dose=120 mg; 3 patients; median follow-up=13 weeks): 2 of the 3 patients reported improvement in constitutional symptoms including fatigue, night sweats, and pruritus. 1 patient had a 25% decrease in spleen size (28 to 21 cm). 2 patients have been dose escalated to 240 mg/day. Cohort 4 (starting dose=240 mg; 3 patients; median follow-up=8 weeks): 1 patient developed Grade 3 anemia (baseline Grade 1) at the end of the first cycle. 1 patient reported decreased fatigue. All 3 patients have experienced a 20 to 53% reduction in spleen size; baseline measurements were 10, 13, and 17 cm. Cohort 5 (starting dose=360 mg; 2 patients; median follow-up=1 week). Both patients had decreased splenomegaly within 1 week of therapy, including 1 with disappearance of palpable splenomegaly from a baseline of 20 cm; this patient also reported significant improvement in constitutional symptoms. Conclusions: Preliminary findings indicate that TG101348 is well tolerated in patients with myelofibrosis. Although it is too early to make valid conclusions, a decrease in spleen size has been noted at higher dose levels. Similarly, improvement in constitutional symptoms has been reported by some patients. Updated results on current and future patients, including data on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and changes in V617F allele burden and plasma cytokine levels will be presented at the meeting.",
