    "abstract_text": "Background The achievement of complete hematologic remission (CR) is used as predictor for treatment response in patients with myeloid leukemia (AML).However <5% blasts in the bone marrow does not reflect the presence of tumor burden precisely. Minimal residual disease (MRD) in the first complete remission (CR1) may play a critical rule in assessment of treatment response and prediction of subsequent relapse. Patients and Methods Leukemia associated immunophenotyping (LAIP) for 73 patients with denovo AML monitored at diagnosis , day 14 and day28 post-induction by multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC). Results CR achieved in 60(82%) patients and 13(18%) patients did not. Among the 60(80%) patients who achieved CR 9 (15%) were MRD negative and 51(85%) were MRD positive at day14. Significant association between MRD detection and disease free survival (DFS) using 0.01% cut off value (P=.015). Day 28 post induction show highly significant association between MRD and DFS using 0.01% cut off value (P=0.001) as 38(63%) patients were MRD negative and (27%) were positive. Significant association between MRD detection and overall survival (50 month) at day 14 and day 28 (P=0.02, P=0.001) respectively using cut off value 0.01%. MRD was positive in 63(86%) at day 14 and (37%) at day 28. Conclusion MRD detection at day28 and d14 at the end of induction in patients in CR may have a prognostic significance on clinical outcome and may thus be a useful marker for risk stratification.
