    "abstract_text": "MMSET/WHSC1 is a histone methyltransferase (HMT) overexpressed in t(4;14)+ multiple myeloma (MM) patients, and is believed to be the driving factor in the pathogenesis of this subtype of MM. Overexpression of MMSET also occurs in solid cancers, including neuroblastoma, colon and prostate. MMSET overexpression in MM and prostate cells leads to an increase in histone 3 lysine 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2), and a decrease in histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). This altered epigenetic landscape is accompanied by changes in proliferation, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility. Prior work linked methylation of histones, including H3K36, to the ability of cells to undergo DNA damage repair. In addition, t(4;14)+ patients frequently relapse after regimens that include DNA damage-inducing agents, suggesting that MMSET might play a role in DNA damage repair and response. To investigate the role of MMSET in DNA damage repair, we transfected U2OS cells with a linearized vector expressing a neomycin-resistant gene. In the presence of G418, only cells that are able to integrate this plasmid through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) can survive. siRNA knockdown of MMSET led to a decrease in cell survival, suggesting that MMSET is necessary for efficient DNA repair. We also used U2OS cells engineered to express the AsiSI enzyme fused to an estrogen receptor hormone-binding domain. Upon tamoxifen treatment, double strand breaks (DSBs) are induced at multiple AsiSI recognition sites, accompanied by an increase in \u03b3H2AX foci. The extent of repair after AsiSI -induced damage was ascertained by the ability of a DNA fragment that spans a specific cut site to be PCR amplified. With MMSET knockdown, there was a >10 fold increase in unrepaired DNA. ChIP analysis showed that with the depletion of MMSET, \u03b3H2AX persisted at the cut site. ChIP for specific effectors of DNA damage showed a marked decrease of recruitment of CtIP and RAD51 to the DSB. However, immunoblot analysis showed that CtIP and RAD51 levels were drastically decreased with MMSET depletion, thus explaining the loss of their recruitment to DSBs. In contrast, XRCC4 levels were maintained with MMSET siRNA, but its recruitment to the DSB decreased. CtIP is important for both NHEJ and homologous recombination (HR), RAD51 is critical for HR, and XRCC4 is necessary for NHEJ, suggesting that MMSET is important in multiple pathways of DNA repair. To study the effect of MMSET in MM, we used the t(4;14)+ KMS11 cell line, NTKO, and genetically matched TKO cells in which the overexpressed MMSET allele was knocked out. NTKO cells have elevated levels of DNA damage at baseline, as measured by a comet assay and by the presence of elevated numbers of 53BP1-positive foci. Upon addition of the DNA damaging agent melphalan, NTKO cells showed increased damage as measured by an increase in the tail moment by the comet assay. Paradoxically, upon treatment of these cells with the DNA damaging agents, NTKO cells survived better than TKO cells. NTKO repaired DNA damage at an enhanced rate and continued to proliferate after a significant DNA damage insult, whereas TKO cells accumulated DNA damage and entered cell cycle arrest. We repleted TKO cells with constructs expressing either wild-type MMSET or an HMT-dead (Y1118A) isoform. Upon treatment, cells expressing the wild-type MMSET have showed enhanced DNA repair and continued proliferation after DNA damage, whereas cells expressing the HMT-dead protein repaired DNA damage more slowly and entered cell cycle arrest. The HMT activity of MMSET was critical for the induction of expression of genes required for multiple DNA repair pathways including CHEK2 , DDB2 , DDIT3 , RAD51 , and MRE11 , again suggesting that MMSET modulates DNA repair by affecting expression of critical components of the repair machinery. The clinical relevance of these finds becomes more apparent in vivo . Luciferase-tagged KMS11 cells harboring doxycycline-inducible MMSET shRNA were injected into nude mice. After one week, mice were treated with doxycycline and injected with melphalan or saline. Knockdown of MMSET or melphalan treatment alone decreased tumor growth but eventually all mice had progressive disease. Only when MMSET was knocked down and chemotherapy given were the mice rendered tumor free. These findings indicate a new mechanism for the ability of MMSET to enhance DNA repair and identify the protein as a potential therapeutic target in MM and other cancers.
