    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3029 Introduction: Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is part of many conditioning regimens for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT) with the aim of reducing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), due to in vivo T-cell depletion. ATG administration may be accompanied by fever, chills, headache or other side effects that affect patient's management and can cause a delay in stem cell infusion. In order to improve ATG tolerance, since November 2010 we modified our fludarabine-busulfan-ATG (FBA) conditioning for RIC transplants with the addition of 1-day rest between the last ATG administration and stem cell infusion. No modification of drugs or GvHD prophylaxis occurred: five days of fludarabine, two days of i.v. busulfan and two days of ATG Thymoglobuline (10 mg/kg total dose) were administered during conditioning, and ciclosporine for GvHD prophylaxis together with MMF only in the presence of a mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD). Aim: To analyse whether the addition of 1-day rest between ATG administration and stem cell infusion impacted on outcome of adult patients receiving AlloSCT after FBA conditioning with respect to previous no-rest modality, in particular acute grade 2\u20134 or grade 3\u20134 GvHD. Methods: The 1-day rest cohort (ATG-rest) was compared with a previous consecutive cohort of patients (no rest) transplanted at our center. Analysis of acute GvHD among the two groups was performed as well as of chronic GvHD, OS, PFS, NRM, relapse/progression. Results: A total of 64 and 63 patients were included in ATG-rest and no-rest cohorts respectively. First patient in the no-rest cohort received AlloSCT on November 2008. Follow-up was thus longer in this cohort: median 27 months (21\u201337) vs. 15 (11\u201320), p<0.0001. No significant differences of patients' age, diagnosis and disease status at AlloSCT between the two groups were observed; matched unrelated donors (MUDs) were higher in the ATG-rest group whereas the number of MMUDs was similar in both groups (see Table 1 ). Rate of acute and chronic GvHD and NRM, probabilities of OS and PFS did not differ between the two groups ( Table 1 ). Unexpectedly, relapse/progression rate was lower in the ATG-rest groups (p=0.002), although disease status at AlloSCT was not significantly different between the two cohorts. Median day of relapse or progression from AlloSCT in the no-rest group was +165 (35\u2013476) vs. +57 (8\u2013215) in ATG-rest one, p=0.004. No difference in relapse/progression was observed according to donor (HLA-identical sibling vs. MUD vs. MMUD) and a lower relapse risk in 1-day rest group is confirmed after adjustment for type of donor: HR = 0.29 (0.12\u20130.72), p=0.01. Conclusion: The addition of 1-day rest between last ATG administration and stem cell infusion did not impacted on GvHD occurrence after AlloSCT after FBA conditioning. The finding of a reduced rate of relapse/progression in the ATG-rest group deserves to be investigated and requires longer follow-up. Table 1. Demographics & Results  . No rest (n=) .
