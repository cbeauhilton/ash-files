    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2345 Recently, we identified a population of very small embryonic-like (VSEL) stem cells (SCs) in adult bone marrow (BM) ( Leukemia 2006:20;857 ). These Oct4 + CXCR4 + SSEA-1 + Sca-1 + CD45 \u2212 Lin \u2212 VSELs are capable of differentiation in vitro into cells from all three germ lineages and in in vivo animal models they can be specified into mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) ( Stem Cells Dev 2010:19;1557 ), cardiomyocytes (Stem Cell 2008:26;1646 ), and long-term engrafting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) ( Exp Hematol 2011:39;225 ). Be employing gene-expression and epigenetic profiling studies we reported that VSELs in BM have germ-line stem cell like epigenetic features including i) open/active chromatin structure in Oct4 promoter, ii) parent-of-origin specific reprogramming of genomic imprinting ( Leukemia 2009, 23, 2042\u20132051), and iii) that they share several markers with epiblast-derived primordial germ cells (PGCs), in particular with migratory PGCs ( Leukemia 2010, 24, 1450\u20131461). However, it was not clear how VSELs maintain pluripotent state. To address this issue we recently employed single cell-based genome-wide gene expression analysis and found that, Oct4 + VSELs i) express a similar, yet nonidentical, transcriptome as embryonic stem-cells (ESCs), ii) up-regulate cell-cycle checkpoint genes, and iii) down-regulate genes involved in protein turnover and mitogenic pathways. Interestingly, our single cell library studies also revelaed that Ezh2, a polycomb group protein, is highly expressed in VSELs. This protein is well known to be involved in maintaining a bivalent domains (BDs) at promoters of important homeodomain-containing developmental transcription factors. Of note a presence of BDs is characteristic for pluripotent stem cells (e.g., ESCs) and as result of Ezh2 overexpression, VSELs, like ESCs, exhibit BDs - bivalently modified nucleosomes (trimethylated H3K27 and H3K4) at promoters of important homeodomain-containing developmental transcription factors ( Sox21 Nkx2.2 Dlx1 Zfpm2 Irx2 Lbx1h Hlxb9 Pax5 HoxA3 ). Of note, spontaneous (as seen during differentiation) or RNA interference-enforced down-regulation of Ezh2 removes BDs what, results in lose of their plurioptentiality and de-repression of several BD-regulated genes that control their tissue commitment. In conclusion , Our results show for first time that in addition to the expression of pluripotency core transcription factor Oct-4, VSELs, like other pluripotent stem-cells, maintain their pluripotent state through an Ezh2-dependent BD-mediated epigenetic mechanism. Based on this our genome-wide gene expression study not only advances our understanding of biological processes that govern VSELs pluripotency, differentiation, and quiescence but will also help to develop better protocols for ex vivo expansion of these promising cells for potential application in regenerative medicine.
