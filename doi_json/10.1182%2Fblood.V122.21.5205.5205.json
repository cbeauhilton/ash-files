    "abstract_text": "Introduction Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of hematological disorders leading to ineffective hematopoiesis and excess blast formation. We aimed to establish the incidence rates and median survival periods in MDS by gender, race and geographic location in a large population cohort. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of the United States (US) SEER database for MDS cases diagnosed between 2001 and 2010 using ICD-0-3 histology codes 9980/3, 9982/3, 9983/3, 9984/3 and 9986/3. Incidence rates were calculated using the 2000 US standard population. Five-year relative survival rates were measured using the Kaplan-Meier method after excluding cases diagnosed by death certificate and autopsy. Results 14,920 cases were identified of which 87.2 % (n = 13,009) were present in age group sixty years and above. Age-adjusted incidence rates (per 100,000) for males were 14.8, 10.0, and 12.7 for white, black and other races respectively. The rates for females were 7.7, 7.1, and 7.0. On US county wise MDS case analysis, 11296 (86.8%) of cases were diagnosed in metropolitan counties and 1694 (13%) cases in nonmetropolitan counties. Median relative survival for white, black and other males were 27 months, 36 months and 24 months respectively ; 35 months, 38 months and 37 months for females. Five-year relative survival for white, black, and other males were 32.5% (95% CI 30.7- 34.3), 36.1% (95% CI 28.3 - 43.9) and 30% (95% CI 24.2 - 36.0) vs. 36.2% (95%CI 34.1 - 38.3), 41.1% (95% CI 34.4 - 47.8) and 37.3% (95% CI 30.2 - 44.5) for females. Median relative survival for cases from metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties were 31 months and 31 months respectively. Five-year relative survivals were 35.1% (95% CI 33.7-36.5) and 32.6% (95% CI 29.1-36.0) for metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties MDS cases respectively. Conclusion The incidence of MDS was higher in males compared to females with the highest rate in white males. Survival rates were similar in both sexes. No significant difference in survival rates were seen among the racial groups. No significant difference in the median survival and five-year relative survival rates were noticed between metropolitan and non-metropolitan groups.
