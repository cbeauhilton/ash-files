    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1859 Background: Two hypomethylating agents, azacitidine and decitabine, are active in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and both drugs have been approved for the treatment of MDS in Korea. In this retrospective analysis, we tried to analyze the effects of hypomethylating agents on the clinical outcomes of the patients with MDS. Methods: A total of 385 patients, who were diagnosed as MDS at the Asan Medical Center between July 1992 and March 2010, were included in this study. We divided the patients into three treatment groups such as hypomethylating therapy (HMT, n=92), intensive chemotherapy (IC, n=15), and supportive care (including low-dose cytarabine and immunosuppressive treatment, SC, n=278). Primary end points of this study were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). PFS was defined as time from diagnosis to AML progression or death. All survival data were censored at the time of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to eliminate the influence of HCT on survivals. The difference of survivals was compared using time updated Cox model because times from diagnosis of MDS to treatment (HMT or IC) were various. Results: Baseline clinico-laboratory features were not significantly different between 3 treatment groups (HMT vs. IC vs. SC) in regard to sex, age, WHO subtype, and IPSS risk category. Among 83 patients in the HMT group, 39 (47.0%) attained any response to HMT including complete response, partial response, marrow complete response, and hematologic improvement. Survival data were the followings: OS, HMT vs. IC vs. SC, median 62.5 vs. 16.7 vs. 21.0 months; PFS, median 37.7 vs. 13.8 vs. 17.8 months. Multivariate analyses by stratified time updated Cox model showed that hazard ratio (HR) of HMT compared to SC was 1.029 (95% CI, 0.670\u20131.582, P=0.895) for OS and 0.539 (95% CI, 0.362\u20130.803, P=0.002) for PFS. When we performed subgroup analyses in lower risk disease (IPSS Low/Intermediate-1) and higher risk disease (IPSS Intermediate-2/High), the effects of HMT on survivals were different by the risk stratification of MDS. In lower risk MDS, there were no survival benefits of HMT compared to SC (OS, median 53.9 vs. 39.8 months, HR 1.570, P=0.108; PFS, median 37.7 vs. 52.5 months, HR 0.880, P=0.633), whereas both OS and PFS were significantly longer in HMT compared to SC (OS, median 137.9 vs. 5.9 months, HR 0.289, P=0.043; PFS, median 80.2 vs. 0.9 months, HR 0.154, P<0.001). Conclusion: Our data suggested that hypomethylating therapy could improve the survivals (OS and PFS) of the patients with higher risk MDS. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
