    "abstract_text": "Background Although treatment outcomes for childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) have dramatically improved in recent years, treatment outcomes in adolescents and young adults (AYA, ages 16-39) have remained inferior due to unfavorable cytogenetic features associated with increasing age and differences in treatment for this population. Pediatric-inspired protocols include L-asparaginase for induction and intensification phases, which are thought to be less tolerable and to lead to increased adverse events in adults. As a result, they are not widely used in the AYA population. Although non-comparative studies suggest improved survival in AYA patients treated with pediatric-inspired protocols, the long-term risk-benefit profile of treating AYAs with a pediatric-inspired ALL protocol is unknown. We utilized an exploratory decision-analytic approach to model the survival and quality-adjusted survival of a pediatric-inspired protocol versus hyper-CVAD, a widely utilized adult protocol, in AYA patients with Philadelphia negative ALL. Methods Patient outcomes were simulated using a 6-state Markov model including complete response (CR), no CR, first relapse, second CR, second relapse, and death. Hyper-CVAD protocol outcomes were modeled by fitting a Weibull distribution to the progression free survival curve of AYA patients from a single-center study of 288 patients a ; we utilized comparable patient data from a retrospective study of 85 patients treated with a pediatric-inspired regimen b to estimate a relative progression difference (HR = 0.51), and used this estimate to model survival for pediatric-inspired protocol patients. We estimated health state utilities (quality of life) based on treatment stage, and assumed the pediatric protocol had a 0.10 disutility compared to hyper-CVAD prior to the maintenance phase of treatment. Our analysis compared total life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between treatment protocols at 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years. Figure 1 View large Download slide Figure 1 View large Download slide  Close modal Results Treatment with the pediatric-inspired protocol led to a 0.04 increase in life years but a 0.01 decrease in QALYs at 1 year. By years 5 and 10, the pediatric-inspired protocol resulted in 0.18 and 0.24 increases in life years and 0.25 and 0.32 increases in QALYs, respectively, relative to hyper-CVAD. The lower quality of life associated with the induction and intensification phases of pediatric treatment was largely offset by more favorable progression-free survival and overall survival in comparison to hyper-CVAD.

However, the pediatric protocol leads to an increase in life years throughout all treatment stages and an increase in QALYs in the long-term following the initial stages of treatment. Ongoing work will incorporate treatment and adverse event costs to estimate the cost-effectiveness of pediatric-inspired versus hyper-CVAD protocols. a Kantarjian H. et al.
