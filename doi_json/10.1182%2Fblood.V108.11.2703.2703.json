    "abstract_text": "Systemic mastocytosis is a clonal disorder associated with a constitutive activation of the c-kit tyrosine kinase based on point mutations and is characterized by mast cell infiltration of extracutaneous organs. Nilotinib is a novel aminopyrimidine which potently inhibits Bcr-Abl, as well as the PDGF-R, and c-kit tyrosine kinases. Preclinical data demonstrated the activity of nilotinib against D816V mutated c-kit in biochemical and cellular assays. This Phase II study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nilotinib administered at an oral dose of 400 mg twice daily to patients with systemic mastocytosis defined by specific disease criteria and with a clinical indication for treatment. Data are available for 60 patients (34 male, 26 female). The median age is 51 years (range, 29 to 79). Of the 60 patients 31 (52%) had extramedullary involvement at baseline. In 30/36 patients investigated (83%) D816V c-kit mutation was found by D-HPLC and/or conventional sequencing in bone marrow or extracutaneous organs. Two patients showed the c-kit I798I polymorphism. Treatment is ongoing for 38 (63%) patients; 22 (37%) have discontinued; ten (17%) for adverse events, seven (12%) withdrew consent, and one (2%) each for disease progression and lost to follow-up. There were two (3%) deaths related to disease progression. Based on investigators\u2019 assessment of serum tryptase, bone marrow mast cell counts and improvement of clinical symptoms 12 patients (20%) had a documented clinical response including two (3%) complete, five (8%) incomplete, four (7%) minor, and one partial response. Adverse events occurring in >15% of patients included nausea in 28 (47%), headache in 26 (43%), fatigue in 25 (42%), vomiting in 22 (37%), diarrhea in 21 (35%), pruritis in 16 (27%), and rash in 15 (25%) patients, dizziness and muscle spasms in 14 (23%) patients each, bone pain in 12 (20%), pyrexia and myalgias in 11 (18%) patients each, and dyspnea, constipation, increased ALAT, and arthralgias in ten (17%) patients each. Most side effects occurred early after initiation of nilotinib therapy and were successfully treated with H1- and H2-blockers and/or corticosteroids, indicating a mast cell degranulation syndrome. Overall the most frequent Grade 3/4 adverse events included diarrhea in four (7%) patients, and thrombocytopenia and headache in three (5%) patients each. The data suggest that nilotinib has clinical activity and an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in patients with systemic mastocytosis with constitutive c-kit activation. Individual molecular characterization will help to guide targeted therapy in this disease.",
