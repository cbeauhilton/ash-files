    "abstract_text": "Deletion of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 (Trp53 in mice) has been associated with the development of numerous human malignancies. TP53 acts as a central coordinator of the DNA damage response. In mice, pan-Trp53 deletion leads predominantly to the development of T-cell lymphomas, followed by B-cell lymphomas, sarcomas and teratomas. In order to dissect the role of Trp53 in the hematopoietic system, we created two different loss of function mouse models: Pan-hematopoietic Trp53 deletion using Vav1-Cre based deletion; and a B-cell-specific deletion was created using CD19-Cre. Vav1-p53CKO mice developed hematolymphoid malignancies with 100% penetrance by 12 months. Most malignancies observed were CD3e+ T-lineage lymphomas involving the thymus or spleen (37/45). Beyond 200 days, these mice predominantly developed mixed myeloid malignancies. The shift away from T-lineage malignancies in older mice may reflect aging-related decline of pre-malignant lymphoid progenitors and skewing to myeloid progenitors. Flow cytometric characterization of the T-lineage lymphomas identified a mix of tumors, including double-negative (CD4-CD8-), double-positive (CD4+CD8+), or single positive (CD4/CD8). In pre-malignant mice, Vav1-p53CKO thymocytes showed accelerated maturation with most of the cells in the DN4 stage, suggesting a bypass of the p53-dependent DN3 \u03b2-selection checkpoint. All T-lineage lymphomas showed overexpression of surface Notch1 as well as overexpression of Notch1 targets Hes1 and p21 at the transcript level. Consistent with prior data, normal murine thymocyte subsets showed high levels of expression of Notch1 target genes at the DN3 stage of development, which appears dysregulated in these T-lineage lymphomas. This Notch1 activation was found to be multifactorial with increased Mdm2 and decreased Numb levels seen in tumors. Overall, we demonstrate Notch1 activation and subsequent acceleration through the T-cell developmental stages in this model of pan-hematopoietic Trp53 deletion. The B-cell specific Trp53 knockout mice (CD19-P53CKO) (n=54) were followed up for up to 2 years. The majority (47/54) developed splenomegaly in an age-dependent manner. Histologic examination showed marginal zone expansion (6/54), frank low-grade marginal zone lymphoma (16/54) or diffuse splenic lymphoma (25/54). The disease was confined to the spleen in the case of lower-grade histology while higher grades correlated with liver and kidney involvement. Flow cytometric analysis of tumors showed B220+ CD19+ IgM+ cells. Interestingly, these tumors demonstrated low levels of Notch2 expression, which normally is highly expressed in marginal zone B-cells. In order to characterize pathogenesis, we sorted follicular and marginal zone B-cells from floxed P53 and pre-malignant CD19-P53CKO mice. RNA was isolated from all these fractions and the spleens of 5 CD19-P53KO mice with diffuse lymphoma and subjected to RNA-Seq. A comparison of the floxed p53 with the CD19-P53CKO fractions (follicular and marginal zone) revealed a highly similar transcriptome. On the other hand, p53-deficient lymphomas showed >10,000 genes significantly differentially expressed demonstrating the unique transcriptome which developed during malignant transformation. Pathway analysis of these genes using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified enrichment of PI3K, Rap1 and MAPK signaling pathways, which are associated with cellular proliferation. Overexpression of the PI3K pathway genes Ccne1 , Sgk1 , Mapk13 and Pik3cb were validated by qPCR in 10 independent tumor samples when compared to the splenic marginal zone fractions. In the B-cell lineage, Trp53 deficiency leads to the dysregulation of multiple genes involved in key cellular signaling pathways, including the PI3K/MAPK pathway. In summary, pan hematopoietic deletion of Trp53 led to T-lineage lymphoma in young mice and myeloid tumors in older mice; with activation of Notch1 signaling in the former. B-cell specific deletion of Trp53 led to splenic marginal zone and diffuse B-cell lymphoma with transcriptional dysregulation of key signaling molecules. Hence, tumorigenesis by Trp53 deletion is tightly linked to lineage and appears to dysregulate key signaling pathways that are operant in those lineages, potentially identifying novel strategies for therapeutic interventions in P53 dependent human hematolymphoid malignancies.
