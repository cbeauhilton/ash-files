    "abstract_text": "Over the past two years we have employed daily SC fondaparinux as longterm anticoaguation in five pediatric patients who presented with deep venous thrombosis (DVT; 3 cases) or DVT combined with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) confirmed by ELISA for HIT antibody ( 2 cases). The Table summarizes characteristics of the patients. In all cases, anti-factor Xa levels were obtained 3\u20134 hrs after the third dose and were in the range of 0.5 to 1.2 IU/ml, calibrated to fondaparinux. Indications for fondaparinux were outpatient treatment of HIT or suspected HIT (2 cases), a desire for true once-daily outpatient dosing of a SC agent (3 cases), or a desire to minimize volume of agent given SC (2 cases). Dosing for Pt 1 was based upon a calculated enhanced renal excretion of fondaparinux in very young children, assuming drug metabolism to vary as (body mass} 0.75 rather than as body mass. Pt 5 had previously required 10,000 IU of a low MW heparin SC bid, in view of her heterozygous ATIII deficiency, and suffered recurrent hematomas at the injection sites. These almost entirely resolved with use of fondaparinux and a consequent 60% reduction in the daily injected volume of anticoagulant. There have been no episodes of recurrent thrombosis and no bleeding complications after a mean pt follow-up of 8.5 months. Thus, fondaparinux can be employed safely and effectively in both young children and adolescents, with and without HIT. Patient Characteristics  Pt Number . Age . HIT . Risk factors .
