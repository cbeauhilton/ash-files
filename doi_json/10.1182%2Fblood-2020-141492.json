    "abstract_text": "Base editors are capable of installing precise nucleotide mutations at targeted genomic loci and present the advantage of avoiding double-stranded DNA breaks. Here, we aimed to target critical motifs regulating gamma-globin reactivation with base editors delivered via HDAd5/35++ vectors. Through optimized design, we successfully rescued a panel of cytidine and adenine base editors (CBE and ABE) targeting the BCL11A enhancer or recreating naturally occurring Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin (HPFH) mutations in the HBG1/2 promoter. In HUDEP-2 cells, all five tested vectors efficiently installed target base conversion and led to gamma-globin reactivation. We observed significant gamma-globin protein production (~23% over \u03b2-globin) by using an ABE vector HDAd-ABE-sgHBG#2 specific to the -113A to G HPFH mutation in HBG1/2 promoter. This vector was therefore chosen for downstream in vivo hematopoietic progenitor/stem cell (HSPC) transduction studies in mice that carry 248kb of the human \u03b2-globin locus (\u03b2-YAC mice) and thus accurately reflect globin switching. An EF1a-mgmt P140K expression cassette flanked by frt and transposon sites was included in the vector for allowing in vivo selection of transduced cells. After in vivo HSPC transduction with HDAd-ABE-HBG#2 + HDAd-SB and low doses of chemoselection, an average of over 40% HbF-positive cells in peripheral red blood cells was measured. This corresponded to ~21% gamma-globin production over human \u03b2-globin. The -113 A to G conversion in total bone marrow cells was on average 20%. Compared to untransduced mice, no alterations in hematological parameters, erythropoiesis and bone marrow cellular composition were observed after treatment, demonstrating a good safety profile of our approach. No detectable editing was found at top-scored potential off-target genomic sites. Bone marrow lineage-negative cells, isolated from primary mice at week 16 after transduction, were capable of reconstituting secondary transplanted mice with stable HbF expression. Importantly, the advantage of base editing over CRISPR/Cas9 was reflected by the markedly lower rates of intergenic 4.9kb deletion and no detectable toxicity in human CD34 + stem cells. Our observations demonstrate that base editors delivered by HDAd5/35++ vectors represent a promising strategy for precise in vivo genome engineering for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies.
