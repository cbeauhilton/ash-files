    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and Dexamethasone (CyBorD) has become the standard frontline approach for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) in many centers across Canada. In the non-transplant eligible setting, recently a randomized controlled trial reported on the impact of Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (LD), showing that this doublet-therapy is a feasible and efficacious combination. Based on the above-mentioned success of the LD combination, we aimed to compare the effect of CyBorD and LD for the treatment of non-transplant eligible MM (NTE) patients in the Alberta Myeloma and Dysproteinemia Program (AMDP). Patients and Methods : The primary objective was to assess ORR and PFS for NTE MM patients treated with CyBorD and LD. The recommended CyBorD regimen was as follows: bortezomib 1.3-1.5 mg/m 2 SC or IV days 1, 8, 15 of a 28 day cycle (as of August, 2013 we adopted the a strategy whereby bortezomib can also be given on day 22), cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 PO days 1, 8, 15 and 22 and dexamethasone 20-40 mg PO days 1, 8, 15 and 22 with an aim to deliver a minimum of 9 cycles of treatment. LD was given at 25 mg days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle with Dexamethasone 20-40 mg PO days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Dose adjustments were at the discretion of the treating physician. Two-sided Fisher exact test was used to test for differences between categorical variables. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant and survival curves were constructed according to the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log rank test. Results: Ninety-one patients have received CyBorD and 56 have received LD. Clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1 . At the time of analysis, 64 and 32 patients in the CyBorD and LD are alive of which 10 and 11, respectively, have progressed, ORR and VGPR rates were 85.7% and 56% for patients treated with CyBorD, and 83.9% and 64% for LD respectively (p=0.3). Estimated median OS was 40 months for CyBorD compared to 66 months for LD (p=0.156). In addition, median PFS was longer for LD patients compared to CyBorD (26 months vs 16.4 months, p=0.018). The rate of treatment discontinuation was similar between both groups (8.7% vs 10%, p=0.3). In Conclusion: CyBorD and LD appeared to be effective treatment options for NTE myeloma patients with similar response rates. Recognizing the limitations of a retrospective series, it is interesting to note a longer PFS and a trend towards better PFS in the LD group, however, longer follow-up and prospective validation is still required.
