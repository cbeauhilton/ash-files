    "abstract_text": "Abstract 193 Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital erythroid hypoplasia associated with physical malformations and predisposition to cancer. Of the many different DBA disease genes known, all encode for ribosomal proteins, suggesting that DBA is a disorder relating to ribosomal biogenesis or function. Among these genes, ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) is the most frequently mutated (25 % of the patients). The generation of animal models for DBA is pivotal in order to understand the disease mechanisms and to evaluate novel therapies. We have generated two mouse models for RPS19-deficient DBA by taking advantage of RNA interference (Jaako et al, 2009 ASH meeting abstract). These models contain RPS19-targeting shRNAs expressed by a doxycycline-responsive promoter downstream of the Collagen A1 locus allowing an inducible and dose-dependent regulation of shRNA. As we have previously reported, the induction of RPS19 deficiency results in a reduction in the number of erythrocytes, platelets and white blood cells, and flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow after a short-term induction reveals increased frequencies of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells reflecting the onset of stress hematopoiesis. In the current study we have analyzed the long-term effect of RPS19 deficiency in bone marrow. In contrast to a short-term induction, flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow after 51 days revealed decreased frequencies of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that correlate with a severe peripheral blood phenotype. In addition, we observed a 3\u20136 fold increase in apoptosis in RPS19-deficient bone marrow compared to controls based on TUNEL assay. Furthermore, transplantation of whole bone marrow cells from transgenic donors into wild type lethally irradiated recipients confirms that the observed phenotype is autonomous to the blood system. To study whether long-term RPS19 deficiency functionally impairs hematopoietic stem cells, we pre-induced mice for 30 days followed by 15 days without doxycycline to restore the RPS19 expression. Mice were sacrificed and total bone marrow cells were transplanted together with wild-type competitor cells (1:1) into wild type lethally irradiated recipients without doxycycline. This experimental setting allows us to assess the functionality of pre-induced hematopoietic stem cells in absence of ribosomal stress. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood one month after transplantation clearly demonstrates decreased reconstitution from pre-induced donors compared to the wild-type competitor. While this time point reflects mainly the function of transplanted progenitors, long-term analysis of hematopoietic stem cell function in these recipients is ongoing. To study the molecular mechanisms underlying the hematopoietic defect we performed comparative microarray analysis. We chose to analyze preCFU-E/CFU-E erythroid progenitors since we have previously located the erythroid defect at the CFU-E \u2013 proerythroblast transition based on flow cytometry and clonogenic proliferation cultures of prospectively isolated erythroid progenitors. Microarray analysis of preCFU-E/CFU-E progenitors reveals deregulation of several genetic pathways, including a robust upregulation of p53 pathway genes, and these targets have been confirmed by real-time PCR. Furthermore, many of p53 target genes are also upregulated in the Lineage \u2212 Sca-1 + c-Kit + (LSK) population that contains immature hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells suggesting that the activation of p53 is not restricted to the erythroid lineage. To ask whether increased activity of p53 can solely explain the hematopoietic phenotype, we have crossed our mouse model into a p53-null background. In summary, our data suggest that RPS19-deficient mice fail to uphold stress hematopoiesis for extended periods of time, with chronic RPS19 deficiency causing bone marrow failure.
