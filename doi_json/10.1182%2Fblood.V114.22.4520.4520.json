The aim of this study is to clarify the value of 2 D-strain (2DS) in early detection of segmental and global left ventricular systolic dysfunction in thalassemic children. Subjects and Methods This study included two age-matched groups:Group 1 (n=30) thalassemic children and Group 2 (n=10) healthy control children. They undergo conventional echo-Doppler measures of left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic functions. The pulsed tissue Doppler of lateral mitral annulus was recorded. Longitudinal 2D strain in 18 left ventricular segments using 2 dimensional (2DS) speckle-tracking imaging from apical 4, 2, and 3-chamber views, using a Vivid 7 ultrasound system. The images were analyzed using Echopac soft ware. Results There was no significant difference among thalassemic patients and controls in LV fraction shortening, peak systolic and diastolic tissue velocities of lateral mitral annulus. But by the 2 D strain study there were a significant multi-segmental affection of the LV mainly the posterior, anterior walls with predilection mainly to the apical segments, also there was a significant affection of the peak global LV systolic strain with a median value (-17.7 versus -20.75; P = 0.008.). There was no significant correlation between all segmental or global LV systolic strain and the serum ferretin. Conclusion 2DS is a sensitive and accurate tool for early detection of segmental and global cardiac insult in thalassemic children. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
