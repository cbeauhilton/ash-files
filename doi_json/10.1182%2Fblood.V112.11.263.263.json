    "abstract_text": "Background : Responses to romidepsin, a novel pan-HDAC inhibitor, have been observed in patients (pts) with cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL). This Phase 2B, singlearm, open-label registration study enrolled pts with CTCL (Stages IB\u2013IVA) at 33 European and US sites. Pts with histologically confirmed CTCL who failed \u22651 prior systemic therapy, had adequate organ function, and ECOG PS 0 or 1 were eligible. Exclusions included significant cardiovascular abnormality or treatment with QTc-prolonging or CYP3A4-inhibiting drugs. Pts received romidepsin 14 mg/m 2 as a 4-hr IV infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days for up to 6 cycles (extended for stable disease or response). Aim : The primary endpoint was the response rate among evaluable pts, measured by a combination of a weighted scoring instrument to determine skin involvement (SWAT), imaging, and circulating Se\u0301zary cells (as applicable). Results : 96 pts were enrolled and received romidepsin (as-treated); 72 (75%) were evaluable (\u22652 cycles) for efficacy. Enrollment is complete, 4 pts with confirmed PR continue to receive romidepsin on extended treatment, 5 pts off-treatment are being followed. Mean age of all pts was 57\u00b112 yrs, and median time since diagnosis was 3 yrs (range 500 msec. Conclusions : This study shows clinical benefit associated with romidepsin use in treatment-refractory CTCL, with pts achieving durable response and relief from pruritus. Toxicities associated with romidepsin were tolerable and manageable.  . Evaluable Pts N=72 .
