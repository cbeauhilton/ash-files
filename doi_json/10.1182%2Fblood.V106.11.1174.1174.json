    "abstract_text": "We previously have reported that autograft absolute lymphocyte count (A-ALC) is a possible prognostic factor for survival after autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (ASCT) for myeloma (MM). Factors affecting A-ALC in MM are unknown. We hypothesize that method of stem cell mobilization, hematopoietic growth factor (HGF) vs. HGF+Cytoxan chemotherapy (C+HGF), directly affects A-ALC collection. 191 consecutive MM patients between 1994 and 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients generally were mobilized with C+HGF prior to 2003. Thereafter, C+HGF was reserved largely for those with \u22654% circulating peripheral blood plasma cells (PC), a negative prognostic indicator. No patients were transplanted in disease relapse or refractory disease. Patients also were matched for age, sex, \u03b22-microglobulin, conventional cytogenetics, LDH, c-reactive protein, number of prior therapies, plasma cell labeling index (PCLI), pre-mobilization ALC, and % bone marrow (BM) PC. The groups HGF (n=80) and C+HGF (n=111) differed with respect to the conditioning regimen (p < 0.0001), and presence of (\u22654%) circulating peripheral blood PC (p<0.005). The primary end-point of the study was to assess the correlation between HGF vs C+HGF, and A-ALC. The secondary endpoint was to determine if HGF vs C+HGF affected survival post-ASCT. Patients mobilized with HGF had a higher A-ALC compared to those mobilized with C+HGF [0.764 x 10 9 lymphocytes/kg (range: 0.146\u20131.803) vs. 0.212 (range: 0.016\u20131.26), p<0.0001]. No association was identified between A-ALC and conditioning regimens (p = 0.19) and PC (p = 0.31). Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were longer in those mobilized with HGF vs. C+HGF (not reached vs. 48 months, p<0.0150; not reached vs. 21 months, p<0.007, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age \u226550 vs age \u226450 (p<0.05) and A-ALC \u22650.5 vs <0.5x10 9 lymphocytes/kg (p<0.0397) were independent predictors of OS. Factors influencing PFS in the multivariate analysis included circulating PC \u22654% vs <4% (p<0.0157), PCLI \u2265 1% vs PCLI \u2264 1% (p<0.0107), and A-ALC \u22650.5 vs <0.5x10 9 lymphocytes/kg (p<0.0042). On multivariate analysis, the method of stem cell mobilization and the conditioning regimen did not have a statistically significant effect on either OS or PFS. We hypothesize that the differences in PFS and OS seen between the HGF vs C+HGF mobilization groups are mediated through the A-ALC. These data suggest that mobilization regimens should not only collect CD34+ stem cells, but also be optimized to collect an A-ALC target which may impact on PFS and OS post-ASCT."
