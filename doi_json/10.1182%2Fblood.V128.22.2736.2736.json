    "abstract_text": "Recurrent somatic nonsense PHF6 mutations have been reported in patients with T-acute lymphocytic leukemia, AML and chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis. Germ line (GL) PHF6 mutations are responsible for Borjeson\u2212Forssman\u2212Lehmann syndrome (BFLS), a hereditary X-linked disorder characterized by mental retardation and dysmorphic features. PHF6 is a highly conserved 41kDa protein with ubiquitous expression in hematopoietic cells, including CD34 + cells. We screened patients (N=1166) with myeloid neoplasms by targeted multi-amplicon deep NGS targeting all ORFs of PHF6 to determine the prevalence and distribution and molecular context of PHF6 gene alterations. In total, we identified and verified 52 cases with somatic PHF6 mutations, 32 of which were frameshift or nonsense mutations and with a strong male predominance (76%). Mutations were distributed almost equally between 2 DNA binding domains. Previously, PHF6 has been included in other screening panels (Haferlach et al. 2014 and Papaemmanuil 2013) with somatic mutations found in 24/944 and 21/738 MDS cases, respectively. SNP-array karyotyping showed that microdeletions involving the PHF6 locus were present in about 1.2% of myeloid neoplasms, but affected only female patients. The most frequent chromosomal aberration observed in conjunction with PHF6 mutations was trisomy-8 ( P =.018). The most commonly associated somatic mutations included RUNX1 ( P =.001) and IDH1 ( P =.008) but not IDH2 ( P >.1). There was no impact on overall survival with respect to PHF6 mutant status in total or within individual risk groups (low risk (RA,RARS) vs. high-risk (RAEB1/2). Concomitant PHF6 and RUNX1 mutations were associated with particularly poor prognosis. RUNX1 mutational status correlated with PHF6 expression levels and PHF6 expression inversely correlated with RUNX1 mRNA levels. Subsequent analysis of clonal architecture using VAF calculations and serial samples for these cases suggested that PHF6 may function as a founder driver gene in 18% of cases. PHF6 variant allelic frequency (VAF) varied between disease subtypes, with the highest clonal burden found in AML patients ( P<.01 ). Within MDS patients we also found lower expression of PHF6 mRNA in CD34 + cells in MDS overall vs. controls ( P <.01), as well as lower expression of PHF6 in advanced myeloid neoplasms ( P <.05). Lower expression (defined as mean+1SD of controls) was found in 12% and 23% of patients with lower- or higher- risk MDS, respectively. Recent studies have proposed that PHF6 deficiency leads to impaired cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest at G 2 /M phase and DNA damage. Following shRNA knockdown, hematopoietic cell lines showed only moderately accelerated growth and increased response to growth factors, while EPO-dependent UT7, did not result in growth factor autonomy. To delineate the possible pathophysiological pathway involving PHF6, we compared transcriptional expression profiles of 5 different cell lines with shPHF6 to WT counterparts. We then studied the consequences of PHF6 knockdown on transcriptional profiles. We have found 1020 transcripts differentially expressed (with at least 1.5x change up/down) in the context of shPHF6 knock down. Concordant results among all 5 cell lines resulted in 354 genes that were upregulated and 766 that were down-regulated. Analyses with primary patient data derived from low PHF6 expressors and mutant cases found a concordance of 71 upregulated genes and 80 genes that were downregulated. The most significant functional group of transcripts that was found to be modulated was a family belonging to ribosomal biogenesis pathway (pFDR<1x10 -6 ). Mass spec fingerprinting found protein-protein interaction partners that were found to be dysregulated on a transcriptional level. This finding of protein interaction/transcriptional dependence might suggest feedback mechanisms on a transcriptional level. In conclusion, our results indicate that PHF6 mutations are generally present in more aggressive types of myeloid neoplasms, frequently associated with RUNX1/IDH1 mutations. Our functional in vitro studies along with recently published reports suggest an association of PHF6 deficiency with transcriptional regulation and thereby provide a basis for a phenotype conveyed by ancestral lesions, consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor gene.
