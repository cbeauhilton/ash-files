    "abstract_text": "Background: Avoiding unnecessary medical visits related to erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) treatment represents an important consideration for managed-care organizations. Observational data have reported varying visit patterns for cancer chemotherapy patients receiving epoetin alfa (EPO) and darbepoetin alfa (DARB). Few studies have characterized visit patterns in this population during ESA treatment. Objective and Purpose: The objective of this analysis was to describe visit patterns and identify the proportion of medical visits made exclusively for ESA treatment in cancer chemotherapy patients. Methods: Analysis of medical claims between 1/2004\u201312/2005 using the Integrated Health Care Information Systems national database, representing >35 health plans, was conducted. Patients were \u226518 years old, had a cancer diagnosis, received >1 ESA administration, and concurrent chemotherapy (during or within 14 days of ESA initiation). Medical visits during the ESA treatment duration (time from first to last ESA administration) were categorized into mutually exclusive groups based on procedure codes recorded on the visit day: ESA administration, chemotherapy/radiotherapy administration, physician visit, blood count, WBC growth factor administration and other (hydration, antiemetics/antibiotics, etc). Results: 3,462 EPO and 2,839 DARB patients were identified representing 107,149 unique visits (EPO 62,785, DARB 44,364). Mean ESA treatment duration was similar between groups (Days: EPO 59.3; DARB 57.6, p=0.212). The proportion of visits were categorized into mutually exclusive service groups, presented below. Conclusion: Cancer chemotherapy patients receiving ESAs incurred visits for many reasons, but primarily for receiving chemotherapy. Less than 5% of all visits were solely related to ESA administration, regardless of ESA received. Table  Service Group . EPO . DARB .
