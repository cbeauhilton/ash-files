    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1157 The involvement of IFN-\u03b3 in the pathophysiology of AA has been well documented, and overexpression of IFN-\u03b3 in the marrow and blood of patients with AA has been reported. T to A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position +874 of intron 1 of the IFN-\u03b3 gene (IFN-\u03b3 +874) can directly affect the expression of the IFN-\u03b3 gene since position +874 of intron 1 coincides with a putative nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB binding site. Thus far, no study has reported the correlation between the IFN-\u03b3 gene polymorphism and responsiveness of patients with SAA to immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, we investigated the distribution of the IFN-\u03b3 +874 T/A gene by amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR), and analyzed the correlation between the IFN-\u03b3 +874 T/A gene and responsiveness of patients with SAA to IST. ARMS-PCR was used to amplify the polymorphic segments of the IFN-\u03b3 +874 T/A gene in the samples obtained from 54 patients with aplastic anemia and 51 healthy adults. Further, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to assay IFN-\u03b3 levels in the blood plasma of 35 patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) before IST and 20 healthy blood donors. The results showed that the frequencies of IFN-\u03b3 +874 TT genotype in patients with aplastic anemia were significantly higher than the corresponding frequencies in the healthy adults (42.6% vs. 17.6%, \u03c7 2 = 13.780, p = 0. 01) (Table 1). The response rate in SAA patients with increased IFN-\u03b3 levels in the blood plasma was higher than that in SAA patients with decreased IFN-\u03b3 levels in the blood plasma (73.7% vs. 25.0%, p < 0.05). Of the 35 patients with SAA, 15 showed the IFN-\u03b3 +874 TT genotype, whereas response in 11 patients, the high response rate was significantly in the favor of the IFN-\u03b3 +874 TT genotype (73.3% vs. IFN-\u03b3 +874 non-TT 35%, p < 0.05) (Table 2). In conclusion, the IFN-\u03b3 +874 T/A gene polymorphism may be correlated with response to immunosuppressive therapy. Our study showed that the frequencies of IFN-\u03b3 +874 TT genotype in patients with AA were significantly higher than the corresponding frequencies in the healthy adults, thereby suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 +874 A/T gene polymorphism is correlated with the susceptibility of aplastic anemia. Our study also showed that a high concentration of IFN-\u03b3 in the blood plasma before receiving IST and IFN-\u03b3 +874 TT genotype were predictors of a good response to IST; this finding was consistent with that of other studies.
