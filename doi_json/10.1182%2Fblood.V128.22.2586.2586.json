    "abstract_text": "Expanded antigen-specific engineered regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been proposed for potential clinical application for the treatment of undesirable immune responses, such as inhibitor responses in hemophilia A patients and autoimmune diseases. By providing an antigen-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) to polyclonal natural Tregs, we suggested that antigen-specific engineered Tregs would migrate specifically to particular target tissues and induce antigen-specific immune tolerance in the local milieu. Previously, we developed FVIII C2-specific Tregs using a long-term stabilization protocol in vitro and demonstrated that these stabilized engineered Tregs successfully modulated FVIII-specific T-cell and B-cell immune responses in vitro . Furthermore, these engineered Tregs could suppress T-effectors specific for additional epitopes in local milieu in both a cell contact and contactless manner. From these data, we hypothesized that IL-2 and related signaling pathways are major regulatory mechanisms of the suppression. To further investigate how IL-2R signaling is engaged to control T effectors and Tregs, we followed the phospho-STAT5 status of these cells kinetically. Our results showed clearly that IL-2 from activated T effectors is a key requirement for Treg activation, inducing subsequent blockage of STAT5 signal in T effectors by activated Tregs. As further evidence of the efficacy of these specific Tregs, we then determined whether FVIII C2-specific Tregs could suppress the induction of FVIII inhibitor antibody in vivo . Thus, we transferred FVIII C2-specific human Tregs into HLA DR1 hemophilic mice and challenged them with FVIII in vivo . Our results showed that induction of FVIII-specific antibodies was inhibited for over 8 weeks. Taken together, our results suggest a potential therapeutic trial of FVIII-specific engineered Tregs in hemophilia A.
