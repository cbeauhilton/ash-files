    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1924 Bone is among the most frequently transplanted tissue with about 1 million procedures annually in Europe. Allografts and autografts account for more than 80% of total graft volume, despite their considerable disadvantages, including the risk of disease transfer and immunologic rejection, limited supply of bone, costs and complications. Significant growth opportunities exist for synthetic bone grafts in association with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from autologous or allogeneic sources as alternatives to biological bone grafts in orthopaedic and maxillofacial surgery. The objective of REBORNE is to perform clinical trials using advanced biomaterials and cells triggering bone healing in patients. To reach this goal, five phase I clinical studies with 20 patients have been planned in 12 clinical Centers spread in 8 European countries. Aim of the Immunological Unit of Reborne is to assess the MSC immunomodulatory properties in presence of the biomaterial used as scaffold for MSC delivery. All the functional experiments were performed in parallel, by comparing the effects of standard culture conditions and three-dimensional culture setting using MBCP (Biomatlante). Material and methods: Bone marrow MSC were provided from REBORNE Consortium Centers. To perform proliferation assays, different immune effector cells (T, B and NK cells) were stained with CFSE according to manufacturer's protocol. Active caspase-3 cell staining was used for survival quantification of immune effector cells after co-culture experiments. Differentiation potential was evaluated by culturing MSC with two different media containing either bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) or dexamethasone. After three weeks, osteogenic differentiation was quantified by qRT-PCR, alkaline phosphatase activity and alizarin red staining. Results: We found that primed MSC, pre-treated with the inflammatory cytokines IFNg and TNFa, displayed upregulation of HLA-ABC, CD54, CD106 and de novo expression of HLA-DR, both in standard culture conditions and in association with MBCP. Immune effector cells could be cultured and collected even in presence of MBCP and no significant differences were found between standard- (MSC + effector cells) and 3D-coculture conditions (MSC + MBCP + effector cells), in terms of immune effector cell proliferation. In both experimental conditions MSC suppressed T and NK cell proliferation (% suppression: MSC + T = 68.4; MSC + MBCP + T = 62.4; MSC + NK = 17.5; MSC + MBCP + NK = 20.2) and increased B cell proliferation (MSC + B = +13%; MSC + MBCP + B = +12.3%). In addition, immune effector cells viability was not affected by MBCP and MSC co-culture increased their survival even in presence of MBCP; in fact, in each culture condition the percentage of inhibition of T, B and NK cell apoptosis was higher than 20% in comparison to immune effector cells cultured without MSC. Dexamethasone and BMP4 were capable of inducing MSC differentiation into osteoblast-like cells, as confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. We demonstrated that BMP4-based medium led to fully differentiated osteoblasts (Osterix + , RUNX2 + , DLX5 + and alkaline-phosphatase + ). Moreover, MBCP was more efficient in increasing osteoblastic differention as compared to standard culture conditions, as shown by the higher expression of Osteocalcin and Osterix. These data show that the association of MBCP and MSC does not affect MSC properties and suggest that it could be a treatment of choice of bone defects instead of allograft and autograft transplantation.
