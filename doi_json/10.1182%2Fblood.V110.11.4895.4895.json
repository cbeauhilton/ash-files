    "abstract_text": "Differential graft versus host response after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is key to leukemia patient survival. The development of specific graft versus leukemia response targeting tissue-specific minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAgs) is a novel therapeutic approach to treating hematopoietic malignancies. A pilot intensive immune cell therapy was applied to an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient who relapsed around day 43 after receiving unrelated allogeneic BMT with three allele disparities for HLA-A, C and DQB1. The patient received more than thirty infusions of dendritic cell-co-cultured donor-derived immune cells including cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) generated against AML lysate-pulsed dendritic cells (DC), AML-DC fusion, and DC pulsed with HLA-A*2402-restricted ACC1Y mHAg epitope. The latter was expressed by recipient but not by donor hematopoietic cells. ACC1Y-peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) multimer staining detected CTL in the patients peripheral blood at different time points during treatment. Four months after the first mHAg-CTL infusion, CTL-resistant AML cells were detected in relapsed pleural effusion and peripheral blood. Further analysis of the relapsed AML cells revealed complete loss of surface class I HLA-A*2402 and class II HLA molecules. Although the AML-specific immune cells were effective in killing the original AML in CTL assays in vitro, the late relapsed AML became resistant to the early AML-primed CTL. This result suggests that rapidly evolving AML cells may escape the intensive anti-leukemia allo-immune pressure including the mHAg-specific CTL through selective loss of A*2402 expression - the ACC1Y-restricted HLA locus. As the patient suffered ongoing multi-focal extramedullary relapse in muscles, sub-mucosal tissue, intestine, spinal cord, and brain, rare cancer cells resistant to mHAg-specific CTL could evolve quickly. Our study indicates that immune escape through diminished HLA expression, which resulted in lack of cancer cell killing by AML-specific immune cells, including the mHAg-restricted CTL, had developed during the therapy. Therefore, leukemia patients with high load of AML or multi-focal extramedullary relapse may not endure prolonged benefit from a single arm immune cell therapy.",
