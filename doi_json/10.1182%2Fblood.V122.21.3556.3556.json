    "abstract_text": "Introduction While the activity level of ADAMTS13 can be helpful in diagnosing patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), the current long turnaround time of this test for most institutions limits its role in early clinical decision-making about the initiation of plasma exchange. Levels of ADAMTS13<10% are pathognomonic of TTP and levels in excess of 10% indicate an alternate cause of thrombotic microangiopathy. The aim of the study was to look at recent practice in the State of Rhode Island regarding the criteria for initiation of plasma exchange with a subsequent categorization of those patients based on ADAMTS13 activity levels. Methods Patients with a diagnosis of TTP were identified from hospital records of the major hospitals in Rhode Island which perform therapeutic apheresis in calendar years 2011 and 2012. From a chart review and blood bank records, baseline clinical parameters were collected, the number of therapeutic plasma exchanges (TPE) performed and the volume of plasma utilized. Pre-treatment ADAMTS13 activity was recorded if available in addition to the number of days from the initiation of TPE to test result availability. An analysis was performed to examine if patients who had a pre-treatment ADAMTS13 activity level \u226410% differed in baseline characteristics or response to TPE from those with activity levels >10%. Based on the normality of the distribution of the data, independent t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed using SAS version 9.3. Results During this two year period, 24 patients received plasma exchange in Rhode Island for a presumptive diagnosis of TTP. The mean age was 47 years (range 20-89 years) and 38% were male. ADAMTS13 activity was available for 20 patients and 7 (30% of those exchanged) had documented pre-treatment activity levels \u226410% consistent with TTP. The median turnaround time for the ADAMTS13 assay was 10 days (range 2-52). Mean baseline parameters at the time of presentation are shown in the table . As expected, creatinine levels were lower in those patients with true TTP (p=0.0410). ADAMTS13 activity level was predictive of the number of days to a platelet count \u2265150 x 109/L (Pearson correlation 0.56; p-value 0.0458). Overall, 4238 units of plasma were utilized for exchange. Of these 4238 units, 1886 were transfused to patients who were subsequently shown to have an ADAMTS13 activity >10%, and 813 of the 1886 units (20% of all plasma exchanged) were transfused after the results of enzyme activity were available in this population.

Reducing the turnaround time for the ADAMTS13 assay in tertiary care centers could help clinicians better determine which patients will benefit from plasma exchange, avoiding the morbidity and expense associated with large volume plasma exchange.
