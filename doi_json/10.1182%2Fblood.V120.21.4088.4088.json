    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4088 Backgrounds Acute myeloid leukemia(AML) is a hierarchical disease initiating from a rare population of cells known as leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which are typically enriched in CD34+CD38- cells and presumed responsible for the relapse and refractory of AML. Moreover, current regimens may not effectively discriminate between normal and malignant cells. For this reason, it is important to identify therapies that can specifically target the LSC population without affecting normal cells. Disulfiram (DS) is an anti-alcoholism drug that has recently been indicated to show cytotoxic to multiple cancers including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the antineoplastic activity was enhanced in the present of copper (Cu). In the present study, we investigated the effect of DS/Cu on LSCs and further explored its mechanism. Methods and Results CD34 + CD38 - leukemia stem cell (LSC) enriched subpopulations were sorted from both KG1a cell lines and primary AML bone marrow or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n=6) by fluoresce-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Using MTT cell proliferation assay and Annexin-V/PI staining assay, We demonstrated that DS/Cu inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in CD34 + CD38 \u2212 KG1a cells (IC 50 = 0.788\u00b1 0.451 \u03bcM at 24h). With the increasing concentrations of DS (DS=0.05, 0.5, 5, 50\u03bcM), the apoptotic proportion increased from 7.2% to 89.5% at 24h. Apoptosis was also observed in CD34+CD38- primary AML cells and the exposure to DS/Cu (DS=0.01, 0.1, 1\u03bcM;Cu=0.5\u03bcM clearly inhibited the growth of AML-colony-forming units (CFUs) for both CD34+CD38-LSC enriched subpopulations (AML-CFUs decreased from 34.2% to 0% in KG1a cells), but was relatively sparing to normal hematopoietic progenitors. Further more, using flow cytometric analysis, western blot and RT-PCR, we identified that the change in redox status and redox-dependent signaling events play a crucial role in DS/Cu-induced apoptosis. We showed that DS/Cu(DS= 0.625,1.25,2.5,5\u03bcM, Cu=1\u03bcM) increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activated its downstream apoptosis-related SAPK/JNK pathway in association with blockade translocation of Nrf2 and expression of Nrf2-regulated genes in CD34 + CD38 \u2212 KG1a cells. Notably, blockade of ROS by glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC)(10mM) strongly diminished DS/Cu mediated lethality and restored Nrf2 nuclear translocation and blocked JNK activation. Additionally, consistent with the ROS accumulation, we also seen that translocation of RelA/p65 and the expression of NF-\u03bab-related gene, associated with abnormal apoptotic response of LSCs, were significantly inhibited by DS/Cu. Conclusion Taken together, we concluded that DS/Cu might selectively eradicate LSCs by induction of oxidatibe stress and blockade the NF-\u03bab pathway and offers a potential therapeutic option in AML.
