    "abstract_text": "The aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) contributes to the aging of blood system and perhaps the whole organism. The aging process is coordinately determined by both genetic and epigenetic factors, and demonstrates inter-individual variations. We used high-throughput sequencing methods to study the age-dependent changes of genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression patterns in HSCs of C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 mouse strains, which have shown natural variations in HSC aging process. We observed global age-associated decrease of DNA methylation in both strains, but D2 HSCs have a stronger loss of epigenetic control than B6 stem cells during aging. Majority age-related changes of DNA methylation occur from young to mid-aged stages. We identified stable strain-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that overlap with cis -eQTLs. Moreover, transcription factor binding site motifs are more likely to be disrupted in the DMRs, suggesting the potential impact of genetic variations on epigenetic regulation of HSC aging. We further demonstrated that strain-specific DMRs have more profound effects on the aging of B6 HSCs than D2 stem cells. Transposons are differentially regulated by the DMRs in the two strains, in which D2 HSCs are prone to transposon insertion. This study comprehensively investigated the effects of natural genetic and epigenetic variations on HSC aging. Loss of DNA methylation is an epigenetic signature of stem cell aging, and DNA methylation variations correlates with genetic variations, both contributing to inter-individual differences in stem cell and perhaps organismal aging.
