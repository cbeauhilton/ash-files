    "abstract_text": "B-Cell Receptor (BCR) triggering and responsiveness play a crucial role in the survival and expansion of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) clones. In the recent past, several groups including ours have investigated the activation status of the signaling pathways originating from the leukemic BCR. Specifically we found that around 50% of CLL patients display a biochemical signature characterized by constitutive phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (pERK(+)) and constitutive nuclear translocation of NF-ATc1. These cases are unable to respond in vitro to BcR stimulation and are resistant to spontaneous apoptosis, thus resembling B lymphocytes previously anergized in vivo . Similar biochemical and functional features have been recently demonstrated in B leukemic cells persisting in the blood in patients treated with the BTK inhibitor, Ibrutinib, thereby making anergy an attractive target on the way to obtain eradication of the disease. CLL-associated B cell anergy can be specifically targeted by using different MAPK-inhibitors that have been shown to induce apoptosis selectively in the group of pERK(+) CLL. These data suggested that MAPK signalling can be efficiently inhibited in CLL for therapeutic purpose and that the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 may represent a reliable biomarker to predict and monitor treatment response. However, even if the tested compounds were shown to be extremely efficient in inhibiting ERK1/2 phosphorylation in vitro , a lack of clinical activity was reported for many of them when tested in patients, mostly with solid tumors. In the present work, we used Trametinib, a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, recently approved as a single-agent for the treatment of V600E mutated metastatic melanoma, and we investigated, at preclinical level, its activity in both primary CLL samples and a xenograft leukemic mouse model. Trametinib treatment completely inhibited constitutive ERK1/2 phosphorylation in 10 pERK1/2(+) samples at 3uM after 30 minutes treatment. Additionally, in 23 patients Trametinib treatment for 48 hours reduced cell viability in the cells from all 12 pERK1/2(+) patients (28,2% \u00b1 3,5 mean survival) tested as compared to those from the pERK(-) group (11 cases, 58,1% \u00b1 3,8 mean survival, p< 0,0001). To strengthen our in vitro data, we evaluated the effect of Trametinib administration in the xenograft Rag2 -/- gc -/- mouse model subcutaneously transplanted with the CLL cell line MEC1, characterized by specific features of anergy . Mice were subcutaneously injected with 10x10 6 cells and then challenged with Trametinib (oral gavage with 1mg/kg or with vehicle alone) starting from day 21 after tumour injection for 14 days. The effect of the inhibitor was monitored by tumour volume growth. Trametinb administration delayed tumour growth (p<0.05 starting at days 27) and inhibited leukemic cell dissemination in the peripheral blood, peritoneal cavity and bone marrow. In summary, our data further support the idea that blocking anergic pathways may be highly effective not only in vitro but also in vivo with potential clinical implications at least in the subset of patients whose cells are characterized by anergic features, including those with persistent lymphocytosis when treated with Ibrutinib. The preclinical efficacy shown by Trametinib, a drug already approved for clinical use, warrants the implementation of controlled studies in CLL patients.
