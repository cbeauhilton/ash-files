    "abstract_text": "Objective: To explore the profiles of Th1,Th2, Th17 and Treg cells in patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Methods: Samples of peripheral blood were collected from 30 chronic ITP patients ( 9 males and 21 females), aged 41, 21 being in active stage, and 9 in remission stage, and 9 healthy persons in control (3 males and 6 females), aged 36. Peripheral blood was cultured, and activated with PMA/ionomycin when Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells were detected. Flow cytometry was used to measure the intracellular cytokines interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-4 and interleukin (IL)-17 so as to identify the Th1 cells (CD3 + CD8 \u2212 IFN-\u03b3 + IL-4 \u2212 cells), Th2 cells (CD3 + CD8 \u2212 IFN-\u03b3 \u2212 IL-4 + cells) and IL-17 cells (CD3 + CD8 \u2212 IL-17 + cells); Treg cells were identified to CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + cells and uncultured peripheral blood was used to measured the CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + cells by flow cytometry. The ratios of Th1/Th2 were calculated. Results: The Th1/Th2 ratio for patients in active stage was 15.04\u00b19.67, significantly higher than those for patients in remission stage (7.17\u00b15.38, P <0.05) and in control (8.47\u00b13.78, P <0.05); the percentage of Treg cells of the patients in active stage was 0.89\u00b10.58%, significantly decreased than those of patients in remission stage (6.41\u00b11.86%, P <0.001) and in control (6.06\u00b10.85%, P <0.001); the percentage of Th17 cells was 1.94\u00b10.77% for patients in active stage, 2.16\u00b10.52% for patients in remission stage and 1.82\u00b10.58% for patients in control, respectively, and there was no statistic significance between them. Conclusion: Chronic ITP is a Th1 predominant disease; decreased number and function of Treg cells might be one of mechanisms that cause immune regulation dysfunction in chronic ITP; Th17 cells might not play a role in the development of chronic ITP.",
