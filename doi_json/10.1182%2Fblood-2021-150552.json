    "abstract_text": "AFM13 is a bispecific tetravalent innate cell engager (ICE\u00ae) with two binding sites for CD16A and CD30 on immune cells and tumor cells, respectively. AFM13 is designed to potently activate anti-tumoral responses of natural killer (NK) cells, through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and macrophages via antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) towards CD30 + tumor cells. It is widely known that the number of NK cells and their anti-tumor activity are often compromised in patients with cancer, including CD30 + malignancies such as Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (Reiners, K.S. et al., Mol Ther 2013;21:895-903). Accumulating evidence suggests that the selective, high affinity binding of ICE\u00ae to CD16A enables stable pre-complexing with NK cells to enhance ADCC. Early clinical studies with AFM13 have demonstrated safety and efficacy, both as mono- and combination therapy with an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab) (Bartlett, N.L. et al., Blood 2020;136(21):2401-2409), in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) HL or peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). Currently, AFM13 monotherapy is being evaluated in a registration-directed Phase 2 study to treat patients with PTCL (NCT04101331). Additionally, a Phase 1b/2a study in patients with PTCL (NCT03192202) previously demonstrated that NK cell numbers pre- and post-dosing of AFM13 may positively correlate with anti-tumoral response (Sawas, A. et al., Blood 2020;136(1):25-26). Therefore, the safety and efficacy of freshly prepared cord blood-derived allogeneic NK cells pre-complexed with AFM13, followed by three weekly infusions of AFM13 monotherapy, is currently being evaluated in patients with R/R CD30 + lymphomas in a Phase 1 dose escalation study (NCT04074746). The first four enrolled patients, all with HL, have shown a response rate of 100% without any safety concerns (Rezvani, K. et al., presentation AACR 2021). To further develop this CAR-like NK cell immunotherapeutic towards an off-the-shelf product, we evaluated the feasibility of cryopreservation of pre-complexed NK cells and assessed the biological activity of such cryopreserved and pre-complexed NK cells after thawing. In this study, the cell surface retention, suitability for NK cell preloading, and cytotoxic activity of AFM13 and other CD30-specific antibody formats was assessed. Furthermore, the compatibility of these formats with cryopreservation of the resulting CAR-like NK cell product was investigated. Cell surface retention assays on primary NK cells confirm substantially slower dissociation kinetics of the tetravalent bispecific ICE\u00ae compared to corresponding IgG1 or Fc-enhanced IgG1, enabling efficient and durable pre-complexing of NK cells with ICE\u00ae. Surface plasmon resonance analyses confirm long retention of ICE\u00ae independent of the CD16A polymorphism. More importantly, these assays demonstrate that the high ADCC potency and efficacy of NK cells, pre-complexed with CD16A-specific tetravalent ICE\u00ae, is maintained after one freeze-thaw cycle. These data suggest that high-affinity pre-complexing of adoptive NK cells with bispecific, CD16A-selective ICE\u00ae could be a novel cryopreserved off-the-shelf NK cell product for the effective depletion of tumor cells without the limitations and potential risks associated with the CAR-NK cell technology.
