    "abstract_text": "Recently, cord blood transplantation (CBT) for adult is rapidly increasing in number, Especially for the patients over 50 years of age. By the end of 2003, 224 units were shipped for the patients Group I:  50 y.o.21%. We analyzed 152 patients with hematological malignancies including ALL, AML, CML, MDS, malignant lymphoma, myeloma and neuroblastoma reported from CBT center in the world by the end of 2003. Patients and Methods: Group I included 58 patients with 13 standard risk and 45 high risk patients and showed mean\u00b1SD of age; 5.3 \u00b14.1y.o.,BW; 20.5\u00b113.4kg, CB volume at collection; 91.6\u00b127.1ml, NC; 5.5\u00b13.3x10 7 /kg, CFC; 8.6\u00b16.4x10 4 /kg, CD34; 1.5\u00b11.1x10 5 /kg, Group II: 64 cases with 25 standard and 39 high risk patients and age; 30.6\u00b110.3y.o., BW; 51.9\u00b19.5kg, CB volume at collection;116.6\u00b127.7ml, NC;2.6\u00b10.7x10 7 /kg, CFC;5.2\u00b12.6x10 4 /kg and CD34;0.8\u00b10.5x10 5 /kg, Group III: 30 cases with 9 standard and 21 high risk patients and age; 54.1\u00b13.3y.o., BW;55.9\u00b111.0kg, CB vol.at collection;118.8\u00b124.7ml NC;2.4\u00b10.4x10 7 /kg, CFC;4.8\u00b11.9x10 4 /kg and CD34;0.8\u00b10.4x10 5 /kg. The patients who underwent CBT for graft failure (GF) of prior transplant were excluded. Conditioning regimen in Group I demonstrated 54 patients with full regimen and 4 with reduced intensity regimen (RIST); in Group II, 62 patients with full regimen and 2 RIST; and in Group III, 14 cases full regimen and 15 cases RIST. Results: Cumulative myeloid engraftment was seen 67.2% in Group I, 73.4% in Group II and 46.7% in Group III (*Group II vs. Group III: P<0.05). Overall survival /EFS on day 100 showed 73.4%/59.4% in Group I, 74.0%/58.6% in Group II and 43.3%/34.5% in Group III (*Group III vs. others: P<0.05). In Group III, the survival rate indicated 42.8% in full regimen group and 13.3% in RIST group at 1year after CBT. In Group I, four patients died of GF, 13 of relapse, 11 of Transplantation related disease (TRD); in Group II, 5 patients died of GF, 8 of TRD, 10 of relapse. In Group III, four patients died of TRD, 3 of GF and 3 of relapse in full regimen, while in RIST, six patients died of TRD, 1 of relapse and 1 of acute GVHD. Conclusion: The application of CBT has been expanded to the elderly patients (>50 y.o.), although the conditioning regimen and the special medical care for the complications in the early pahse after UCBT has remained to be discussed.",
