    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1056 Most sickle cell anemia patients ( HBB glu6val homozygotes) indigenous to the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia have a fetal hemoglobin (HbF) level of about 20% that is associated with a mild clinical phenotype. Their HbS gene is on the Saudi-Indian (SI) haplotype characterized by an Xmn1 restriction site at position \u2212158 5' to HBG2 (rs7482144), a Hinc2 site 5' to HBE (rs3834466) and other polymorphisms in the HBB gene-like cluster. However, the functional elements within the HBB gene-like cluster and elsewhere in the genome causing high HbF are yet to be determined. In a previous study we found that Saudi HbS homozygotes with the SI haplotype had a common region of autozygosity that spanned about 126 kb and included the complete HBB cluster. We have sequenced 13.6 kb in the HBD-HBG1 intergenic region (chr11:5255683-5269326, HG19), the region of the Corfu deletion. We found a SNP at position \u221268 bp 5' to HBD (c.-118 C>T) only in individuals with a SI haplotype. This SNP was not present in dbSNP build 132 or the 1000 Genomes databases. No other mutation in HBD was identified. This same SNP was recently associated with \u03b4 thalassemia (Phylipsen et al. Int. J. Lab. Hematol. 2011, 33: 85\u201391). Homozygotes for the \u221268 HBD SNP, who were not on hydroxyurea, had a mean HbF of 23%, range 12.1%-33.4% and mean HbA 2 of 2.1%, range 1.2%-3%. We did not find the \u221268 HBD SNP in 15 African Americans with sickle cell anemia selected because of their unusually high HbF (mean HbF 17.2%, range 11%-28.9%). Parents and sickle cell trait carriers from the families of Saudi Eastern Province patients were heterozygous for the \u221268 HBD mutation (mean HbF 1.6%, range 0\u20134.2% and mean HbA 2 2.7%, range 2.4%-3.2%) and one normal sibling did not carry this mutation (HbF 0 and HbA 2 2.9%). Thirty patients with sickle cell disease indigenous to the Southwestern Province of Saudi Arabia, with the HbS gene on an African origin haplotype, (mean HbF 15.5%, range 4.5%-23% and mean HbA 2 2.9%, range 2.1%-3.4% in HbS homozygotes) and 13 normal Saudi controls were examined and none carried the \u221268 HBD mutation. We also sequenced HBD and its promoter in 8 Southwestern Province HbS homozygotes with a Benin haplotype, 4 with HbF 15%, and none had the \u221268 HBD SNP or any other mutation in HBD . Inverse relationships between percent HbF level and percent HbA 2 was seen in 3 groups of HbS homozygotes:1) SI haplotype homozygotes; 2) Benin haplotype homozygotes from the Southwestern Province; 3) African Americans with diverse HbS haplotypes. The increased HbF in sickle cell anemia with \u03b4 thalassemia might involve both post-translational and transcriptional mechanisms. Increased HbF levels might in part be due to the preferential post-translational assembly of \u03b1\u03b3 dimers compared with \u03b1\u03b4 and \u03b1\u03b2 S dimers. When \u03b4 thalassemia reduces available \u03b4-globin chains, this might further favor preferential binding of less positively charged \u03b3-globin subunits to positively charged \u03b1-globin compared with more positively charged \u03b4-globin subunits. Perhaps more importantly, at the transcriptional level, the \u221268 HBD \u03b4 + -thalassemia promoter mutation might favor the interactions of transcription complexes with HBG promoters. The stimulus of hemolytic anemia and expanded erythropoiesis might be required before the favorable genetic milieu for increased HbF production can be fully utilized with the achievement of clinically significant increases in HbF that modulates the course of disease. For example, increased HbF levels of only 3.3%-4.7% have been reported in some hematologically normal individuals with homozygous \u03b4 0 thalassemia (Ohta et al. Hemoglobin 1980, 4: 417\u2013425). High HbF levels in SI haplotype HbS homozygotes might involve the interactions of one or more HBG regulatory regions linked to the HBB gene-like cluster, like the \u221268 HBD SNP, perhaps with trans acting elements. Although the \u221268 HBD \u03b4 + -thalassemia mutation is associated with the SI haplotype and high HbF, functional studies are needed to establish causation.
