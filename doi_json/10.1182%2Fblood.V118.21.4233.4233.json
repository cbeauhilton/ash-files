    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4233 Background: advances in immunophenotyping, cytogenic, and molecular genetics have not only considerably improved our knowledge of the pathophysiology of acute leukemia\u2019s, but have also contributed to a refined classification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL)subtypes and outcome. With the different treatment modalities complete remission (CR) rates of 80\u201385%and leukemia \u2013free survival (LFS) rates of 30\u201340%can be achieved in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Aim: to study the clinico-pathological features and outcomes of adult patients patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Qatar Patients & METHODS: thirty adult patients (age>14 years) diagnosed as all at AL-AMAL Hospital, the oncology hematology center in Qatar, the periode betweenJan06 and Jan 2011 were Retrospectively studied with respect to their clinical. morphological, immunopathologica features at presentation and their treatment outcomes, diagnosis was based on combined morphologic, immunophenotyping and cytogenetic studies.treatment protocols used were BFM mainly for adolescent patients,GMALL and UKALL 12 for adults. RESULTS: ALL constituting 25% of all acute leukemia cases diagnosed during the period the study. the median age was 28.5 years with a male to female ratio 21.six were Qatari and 24 non-Qatari. the most common presentation was with symptomatic anemia and fever (63.3%).laboratory features at presentation revealed.WBC.>30*109/L in13((43.3%).Immunophenotyping showed that 25(83.3%)were B-ALL, only one case9450was of the matureB-phenotype(Burkitt is),twenty two (80%) were CD10positive (common/pre Bsubtypes),two were CD10 negative PreB.non were subtype as proBALL.diagnosis of T-ALL was established in 5 (16.7%)patients.aberrantexpression was noted in14 cases (46.6%)combined expression of both CD13&CD33 being the most common seen in seven cases (50%).OUT OF THE 22 CASES 954.550.Five(22.7) had t (9.22)and one (4.5%)t (4.11).normal in 10(45.5%).thirteen patient travelled before having treatment. two pretreatment death (septic shock. two elderly patients with co morbidities were considered for palliative treatment.13patients were treated in doha, 11 out of 13 (84%)went into complete remission (CR) and two (16%) underwent successful allogeneic bone marrow transplant abroad. CONCLUSION: Although.the series is small to have a final conclusion, however, this study showed that almost all of our ALL cases are of the favorable immunological subtypes (common/ pre ALL) with high CR rate.
