    "abstract_text": "Background: Lenalidomide is a potent thalidomide analogue shown to activate both the innate and adoptive immune system, inhibit angiogenesis, and modify the tumor microenvironment. While lenalidomide has received approval by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of various hematological conditions, ongoing clinical trials are addressing its role in the treatment of B-cell lymphomas. There is a dire need to develop novel well-tolerated, therapies which combine various target-specific agents such as lenalidomide and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We previously demonstrated that lenalidomide is capable of expanding natural killer (NK) cells in a human-lymphoma-bearing SCID mouse model and improve rituximab anti-tumor activity in vivo . Methods: In our current work we studied the effects of lenalidomide on the biological activity of a panel of mAbs against various B-cell lymphomas, utilizing various rituximab-sensitive (RSCL) and rituximab-resistant cell lines (RRCL) generated in our laboratory from Raji and RL cell lines. Functional assays including antibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) were performed to demonstrate changes in sensitivity to rituximab. RSCL and RRCL (1\u203210 5 cells/well) were exposed to either lenalidomide (5 \u03bcg/ml) or vehicle with or without mAb at a final concentration of 10\u03bcg/ml. The mAb panel consisted of two anti-CD20 mAbs: rituximab (Biogen IDEC, Inc.) and hA20, a humanized anti-CD20 mAb (Immunomedics, Inc.); an anti-CD80 mAb (galixumab, Biogen IDEC Inc.), and an anti-CD52 antibody (Alemtuzumab, Berlex Inc.). Changes in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation were determined at 24 and 48 hrs by [ 3 H]-thymidine uptake. For ADCC/CMC studies, NHL cells were exposed to lenalidomide or vehicle for 24 hrs and then labeled with 51 Cr prior to treatment with one of various mAbs (10 mg/ml) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Effector: Target ratio, 40:1) or human serum, respectively. 51 Cr-release was measured and the percentage of lysis was calculated. Changes in antigen (CD20, CD80, and CD52) expression following in vitro exposure to lenalidomide were studied by multicolor flow cytometric analysis. Results: Concomitant in vitro exposure of various RSCL and RRCL cells to lenalidomide and either galixumab, hA20 or alemtuzumab for 24 hrs resulted in improved anti-tumor activity when compared to controls. In addition, pre-incubation of both RSCL and RRCL with lenalidomide rendered cells more susceptible to alemtuzumab-, hA20- and galixumab-mediated ADCC and CMC. No antigen modulation (i.e., upregulation) was observed following in vitro exposure of lenalidomide to NHL cell lines, suggesting an alternative mechanism involved in the improvement antitumor activity observed. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the augmented antitumor effect of lenalidomide is not limited to its combination with rituximab, but also that it augments the antiproliferative and biological activity of alemtuzumab, hA20 and galixumab. Furthermore, these interactions are observed even in our RRCL. Future studies will be directed towards evaluating whether similar activity will be seen in vivo using a human lymphoma-bearing SCID mouse model.
