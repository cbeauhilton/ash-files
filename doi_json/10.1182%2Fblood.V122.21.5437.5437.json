    "abstract_text": "Objective To investigate the therapeutic outcomes of chemotherapy with infusion related HLA-mismatched hematopoietic stem cells for hematologic malignancies. Method Therapy responses and hematopoietic recovery as well as complications of 9 patients were analyzed. Result In the 9 patients aged 29-67 years, four were acute myeloid leukemia, one was acute B lymphocytic leukemia, two were multiple myeloma, one was Hodgkin\u2019s disease, one was diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The average MNC was (3.12\u00b11.29)\u00d710 8 /kg, CD34 + cells was (1.71\u00b1 1.00)\u00d710 6 /kg, CD3 + cells was (2.13\u00b10.99)\u00d710 8 /kg. There was complete remission in four patients, partial remission in one, disease progression in four. Following up 2 to 14 months, four patients was in survival. No donor chimerism was detected and no graft-versus-host disease was observed in any patient. Conclusion Chemotherapy with infusion related HLA-mismatched hematopoietic stem cells for hematologic malignancies may provide a promising treatment method as a novel therapeutic strategy.
