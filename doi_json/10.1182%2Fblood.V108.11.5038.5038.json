    "abstract_text": "Deletions of chromosome bands 13q14 and 17p13 (P53) as well as t(4;14)(p16;q32) or overrepresentation of CMYC are known to be adverse prognostic factors for time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) in myeloma patients receiving conventional or high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. We investigated the impact of these chromosomal abnormalities as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with immunofluorescent cytoplasm immunoglobulin staining (cIg-FISH) on outcome after dose-reduced melphalan/fludarabin based allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in 64 patients (pts) with multiple myeloma (MM). Median age was 52 years (34 \u2013 67 ys.), 38 patients were male, 26 female. 45 pts received stem cell graft from an unrelated donor and 19 pts from HLA-identical sibling. Deletion of 13q14 was found in 35 out of 64 pts (55%), P53 deletion in 7 out of 64 pts (11%), t(4;14)(p16;q32) in 11 out of 56 pts (20%) and trisomy of CMYC in 12 out of 55 pts (22%). The following strong correlations among the genetic changes have been seen: six out of seven pts with P53 deletion also showed deletion in chromosome band 13q14 (86%), which was also found in nine out of eleven pts with t(4;14) (82% del 13) and nine out of twelve pts with CMYC trisomy (75% del 13). The estimated event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) at four years for the entire study population was 48% and 57%, respectively. No significant difference of the estimated event-free survival at 3 years was seen for pts with del 13 (42% vs 54%, p=0,4), with P53 deletion (43% vs 49%, p=0,27) and for pts with t(4;14) (46% vs 62%, p=0,69) or CMYC overrepresentation (37% vs 50%, p=0,35). Comparison of pts showing both del 13 and P53 deletion, del 13 and t(4;14), del 13 and trisomy of CMYC or t(4;14) and CMYC trisomy with the rest of the study population did not show a significantly reduced EFS either. Even the comparison of pts with any chromosomal abnormalities and pts without any genetic changes detected by FISH did not show a significant difference in EFS (48% vs 50%, p=0,8). These preliminary data suggest that the negative prognostic impact of chromosomal abnormalities such as deletion of 13q14, P53 deletion, t(4;14) and overrepresentation of CMYC may be overcome by allogeneic SCT probably due to the graft versus myeloma effect."
