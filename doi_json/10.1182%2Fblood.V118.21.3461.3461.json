    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3461 The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene codes for an evolutionarily conserved histone methyltransferase that is crucial for early hematopoiesis. As a result of a chromosomal translocation involving locus 11q23 results in formation of chimeras composed of the 5' part of the MLL gene fused with more than 60 partner genes lead to disruption of normal function of MLL as a histone methytransferase and acquisition of transcriptional properties conferred by the partner genes. MLL fusion genes (MLL-FG) are often the causal mutations for aggressive acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemias (AML and ALL) that correlated with poor prognosis. In order to treat or even eliminate MLL-associated leukemias, extensive studies on the regulatory mechanism underlying MLL associated transformation and progression have been carried out. Leukemic stem cells (LSC) can derive from either hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells with the recruitment of MLL-fusion genes (MLL-FG) and wild type MLL protein. We report that miR-150, a key hematopoietic regulatory microRNA (miRNA) and one of the most downregulated miRNAs in MLL-associated leukemias, acts as a tumor suppressor to block the leukemogenic potency of leukemic stem cells. When expression of miR-150 was restored, a significantly suppressed leukemic stem cell potency of MLL-AF9 cells was observed both in vivo and in vitro . Gene profiling analysis demonstrated that elevated miR-150 altered various aspects of gene expression patterns in MLL-AF9 cells, including stem cell signatures, cancer pathways, and cell survival. By screening more than 30 predicted target genes, we identified multiple leukemia-associated oncogenes as bona fide miR-150 targets, and knockdown of these genes by shRNAs recapitulated the tumor suppressive effects observed after ectopically expression of miR-150 in MLL-AF9 cells.
