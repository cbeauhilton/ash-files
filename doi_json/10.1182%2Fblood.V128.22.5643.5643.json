    "abstract_text": "Background and objective: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy with a well documented immune dysfunction. Previous reports in murine models and our previous work in MM patients, showed that myeloid cells, both granulocyte-myeloid derived suppressor cells (G-MDSC) and neutrophils sedimenting on top of red cells after density gradients, defined as high-density neutrophils (HDN) are increased and exert an immunosuppressive activity. Moreover, we showed that myeloid precursors could be activate and acquire G-MDSC phenotype if cultures in presence of MM mesenchymal cells. Thus, we characterized functionally HDN to gauge their contribution in immunesuppression, angiogenesis and bone resorption in MM microenvironment. Methods: In HDN freshly-isolated from a series of 60 newly-diagnosed MM, 30 smoldering MM and 30 MGUS we investigated by RT-PCR, flow-cytometry, western-blot and immunofluorescence genes and proteins related to immunesuppression (Arg-1, IDO), angiogenesis (BV8, VEGF, MMP9) and bone resorption (IL1-b, MMP9, CHI3L). Results: First, MM-HDN exhibited an increased expression of immunesuppressive molecules Arg-1 and IDO compared to MGUS and healthy subjects (25.5 vs 6.2 vs 1 fold changes in gene expression, p=0.003), confirmed by functional assay of enzymatic activity, immunostaining and WB, positively correlated with advanced disease. Second, MM-HDN showed increased expression of BV8 and MMP9 (p=0.01, p=0.05) but not VEGF, as confirmed by immunofluorescence. In line with this observation, by using migration assay (CIM plate) MM-HDN induced neo-vasculogenesis in vitro by forming more and aberrant tubes than healthy or MGUS-HDN, thus to disclosure a novel proangiogenic mechanism driven by BV8. Third, MM-HDN showed increased expression of IL1-b, MMP9, CHI3L, associated to increased bone resorption activity, evaluated by dentin-disk assay. The same findings could be obtained treating bone matrix with MM-HDN-conditioned media, suggesting the crucial role of molecules released by MM-HDN but no from MGUS-HDN. Conclusion: taken together, our observations disclosure the contribution of aberrantly activated HDN in MM clinical features, contributing to immunosuppression, angiogenesis and bone resorption.
