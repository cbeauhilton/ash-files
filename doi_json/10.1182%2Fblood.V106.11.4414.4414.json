    "abstract_text": "Summery: Anti-apoptosis is one of drug resistance mechanisms in leukemic cells. It was found in our early study that As 2 O 3 can induce apoptosis of K562 cells, and this effect involve the degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1and consequently the activation of NF-\u03baB. The relationship between drug resistance of leukemic cells and the expression of both I\u03baB-\u03b1and NF-\u03baB associated with apoptosis induced by arsenic trioxide(As 2 O 3 ) was studied in K562 and K562/ADR cells. Methods: Apoptosis was induced in K562 and K562/ADR cells cultured with As 2 O 3 in different concentrations. Western blot was used to analyze the expression of NF-\u03baB in nuclear and I\u03baB-\u03b1 in cytoplasm of these cells. Apoptosis and degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1protein were also observed by flow cytometry. Results: The suppressive effect of As 2 O 3 on proliferation of K562/ADR was lower than that in K562 cell, IC50 values were 19.07\u03bcmol/L and 5.26\u03bcmol/L, respectively. After exposure to As 2 O 3 , the ratio of apoptosis cells increased with the concentration of As 2 O 3 in K562 cells, from(13.25\u00b11.83)% to (50.56\u00b18.62)% with variation of As 2 O 3 from 1\u03bcmol/L to 4\u03bcmol/L(P<0.05). The ratio of apoptosis cells in K562/ADR cultured with 4\u03bcmol/L As 2 O 3 was significantly lower than that in K562 cells, (8.00\u00b11.47)% vs. (50.56\u00b18.62)%, (P<0.05). The level of I\u03baB-\u03b1 in K562 cytoplasm was down-regulated from (88.07\u00b10.99)% to (49.21\u00b10.95)%, (P<0.01) after As 2 O 3 stimulation, while NF-\u03baB in nuclear was up-regulated, that was not found in K562/ADR cells. Conclusion: As 2 O 3 could induce apoptosis of K562 cells, associated with the degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1and the activation of NF-\u03baB. There were resistance to As 2 O 3 induced apoptosis and an abnormal regulation of NF-\u03baB expression by As 2 O 3 in K562/ADR cells."
