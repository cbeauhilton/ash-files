    "abstract_text": "Molecular hallmarks of T-ALL are the aberrant activation of NOTCH signaling and high activity of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Upregulated mTOR and NOTCH have been linked to the resistance of T-ALL to chemotherapy as well as to high frequencies of leukemia-initiating cells. Hence, the mTOR and the NOTCH pathways are promising therapeutic targets in T-ALL. However, clinical success of the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin in acute leukemia has been disappointing. Similar results have been observed in mouse models of T-ALL treated with Notch inhibitors. To investigate the impact of mTOR and Notch inhibition in a genetically complex T-ALL, we developed an aggressive murine T-ALL model, driven by tyrosine kinase signaling, loss of Pten, Cux1-haploinsufficiency and constitutive Notch signaling. In vitro , T-ALL blasts were highly sensitive to inhibition of AKT, mTOR and Notch signaling. We transplanted the leukemias into secondary recipients and initiated treatment with Rapamycin after the onset of leukemia. Rapamycin significantly prolonged survival of the animals (placebo: 27 days, Rapamycin 49 days, p<0.001). Eventually, all Rapamycin treated animals succumbed to the T-ALL that extensively infiltrated the bone marrow and solid organs despite continuous drug administration. When Rapamycin-resistant blasts were explanted and cultured in petri dishes they again became susceptible to Rapamycin, demonstrating a context-dependent resistance rather than outgrowth of intrinsically resistant clones. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that Rapamycin-resistant T-ALL in vivo upregulated genetic networks associated with cell-cell interactions. Stromal cell support from OP9-cells as well as from mesenchymal stem cells recapitulated the in vivo effect and induced resistance to mTOR and Notch-inhibition in T-ALL blasts. Coating the tissue culture wells with Collagen, Fibronectin, Retronectin or Matrigel, did not elicit resistance. By using trans-well assays we show that the stroma-induced resistance was dependent on direct cell-cell interactions. Immunoblots and PhosFlow probing the mTORC1/C2 and Notch pathway demonstrated an identical drug effect on their intracellular targets in resistant T-ALL blasts cultured on stroma cells and susceptible cells in suspension. Since the number of molecules potentially involved in cell-to-cell contacts is vast, we focused on central nodes that organize this process in order to find a potentially druggable target that is critically involved in stroma-induced resistance. Transcriptome profiling pointed towards upregulation of Rac-associated pathways. We determined the activation of Rac1 by PAK-pull down assays in T-ALL blasts grown in suspension or on stromal cells. We observed an increase (FC=1.96 \u00b1 0.58, p=0.04) in activated Rac1 in the T-ALL blasts in contact with a stromal layer. To determine whether Rac activation plays a role in stroma-induced resistance, we devised a strategy to abrogate Rac signaling in T-ALL blasts, but not in the stromal cells, since inhibition of Rac in stromal cells by the Rac-inhibitor NSC23766 led to the their detachment. Furthermore, Rac1,2 and 3 can be functionally redundant, making knock down experiments using shRNAs challenging. The Clostridium difficile serotype F strain 1470 produces toxin B isoform (TcdBF), that selectively glucosylates and inactivates Rac(1,2,3). We pretreated T-ALL blasts with TcdBF and observed a dose-dependent functional inhibition of Rac GTPases monitored by dephosphorylation of the Rac effector kinase pS144/141-PAK-1/2. T-ALL blasts were then incubated for 5 hours with increasing toxin doses, washed 3 times and incubated in toxin-free medium. Eighteen hours after the end of the exposure to the toxins, Rac was still inhibited. Strikingly, in the TcdBF-pretreated T-ALL, the stroma-induced resistance effect was abrogated and clusters of apoptotic cells were clearly visible (>2 fold reduction of the input, p=0.002). In contrast, the carrier-treated T-ALL exhibited resistance to the inhibitors on stroma (>10 fold expansion of the input, p<0.0003). Altogether, we identify the Rac-GTPases as a nexus of stroma-induced drug resistance and show that inhibition of Rac and mTOR is synthetically lethal to T-ALL blasts T-ALL blasts that are in contact with stromal cells , paving the way to augment the effectiveness of small molecule inhibitors in acute leukemia.
