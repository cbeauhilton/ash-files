    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1392 Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by the accumulation of various acquired (cyto)genetic aberrations in the leukemic blasts. Novel state-of-the-art sequencing technologies enable sequencing of complete disease genomes. Methods: We have used Complete Genomics (CG) next-generation sequencing to identify novel recurrent mutations in AML. We have selected a single AML case, WHO: AML with maturation, FAB: M2, karyotype 45X, -Y and a NPM1 mutation. Mutations in FLT3, CEBPA, ASXL1, IDH1, IDH2, NRAS, KRAS and DNMT3A were absent. By whole genome sequencing of the AML and its corresponding remission sample, we identified acquired mutations in the protein coding regions of 31 genes (CG somatic score >0.1), including NPM1 and PTPN11 . Results: Interestingly, a frame-shift mutation in the protein coding region of the Nuclear Erythroid Factor 2 ( NFE2 ) transcription factor gene was identified and acquisition of this mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of both AML and remission samples. The complete NFE2 gene of the index AML patient was sequenced but no additional mutation was present, nor was the remaining allele affected by deletions and/or amplifications. The index mutation introduces a premature stop codon (PTC) in the NFE2 gene, upstream of the region encoding the bZIP domain. To investigate if NFE2 would be recurrently mutated in AML, we screened a cohort of 1139 AML cases by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) analyses for mutations in a 350bp region surrounding the index mutation in the NFE2 gene. We identified NFE2 mutations in 5 additional cases of AML. Subsequently, we screened the complete NFE2 gene in 254 randomly selected AML cases by Roche 454 sequencing. This analysis revealed 8 NFE2 mutant cases in total. These results indicate that approximately 3.5% (8/254) of unselected primary AML cases carry NFE2 mutations. The acquisition of the NFE2 mutations was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of all NFE2 mutant AML cases and their corresponding derived T cells. Frame shift mutations upstream of the NFE2 bZIP domain introducing PTCs were present in 6 out of all identified NFE2 mutant cases (n=13). The remaining cases carried non-synonymous NFE2 mutations and a single case an in-frame insertion/deletion. In our cohort of molecularly and clinically well-characterized cohort of AML patients the NFE2 mutations were not associated with any clinical characteristic or any other (cyto)genetic aberration. Discussion: It is currently unclear if the NFE2 mutations would lead to a gain-of-function or a loss-of-function. Nfe2-deficient mice lack circulating platelets and die of hemorrhage; their megakaryocytes showed no cytoplasmic platelet formation. In addition, NFE2 transgenic mice show MPNs, including thrombocytosis, and spontaneous transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. However, the NFE2 mutations did not associate with abnormal platelet counts in the affected AML cases, nor did the AML cases have consistent megakaryocyte abnormalities. Mutant NFE2 is currently functionally studied by introduction into various cell line models and mouse primary bone marrow. Conclusion: In conclusion, we have identified recurrent mutation in the transcription factor gene NFE2 in a subset of AML cases. The exact role of mutant NFE2 is currently being investigated.
