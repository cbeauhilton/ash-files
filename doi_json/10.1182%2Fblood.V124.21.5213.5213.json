    "abstract_text": "Background: Decitabine, reverts hypermethylation of p15 INK4B gene in vitro, was used to improves cytopenias and blast excess in over 50% of patients with high-risk myelodys plastic syndrome (MDS). In this study, over-expression of Heme Oxygenase-1(HO-1) was found in MDS cells line SKM-1 cells, and it was closely related to resistance to apoptosis induced by decitabine. Objective: we aimed to further investigated what role of HO-1 exactly played in apoptosis induced by low-does of decitabine in MDS. Method: CCK-8 kits was used to determine the proliferation inhibition of SKM-1 cells. Flow cytometry was used for analyzing cell proliferation rate and apoptosis. The methylation status and expression of P15 INK4B in mRNA and protein levels were measured by methylation-specifc polymerase chain reaction (PCR [MSP]). Apoptosis relative factors expression were detected by real-time transcription and Western blot. Result: Up-regulation of HO-1 by transfected it into SKM-1 cells via lenti-virus vector promoted proliferation and protected cells against apoptosis. In contrast, down-regulation of HO-1 enhanced decitabine-induced apoptosis but reduced accumulation of S phase in cell cycle. To explore the mechanism, we detected cell cycle relative protein expression after SKM-1 cells were treated by decitabine in each group. As a result, over-expression of p15 INK4B and CDK4 were observed in SKM-1 cells which HO-1 was inhibited. And p15 INK4B and CDK4 expression-dependent apoptosis was related to caspase3 pathway. Even though HO-1 was silenced, but apoptotic rate never increased as caspase3 pathway was blocked. Conclusion: As we known that p15 INK4B is a keypoint to regulate S phase of cell cycle, in our study, more obvious demethylation of p15 INK4B was seen in group of SKM-1 cells in which HO-1 was down-regulated. It\u2019s equally in patients\u2019 mononuclear cells who suffered from MDS. The worse the prognosis of MDS was judged, the more the mRNA level of HO-1 expressed. In conclusion, over-expression of HO-1 indicated resistance to demethylation of p15 INK4B induced by decitabine. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
