    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4112 We report the characterization of BMS-911543, a potent and functionally selective small molecule inhibitor of the Janus kinase family (JAK) member, JAK2. BMS-911543 is a reversible inhibitor of JAK2 with a biochemical IC50 of 0.001 \u03bc M and Ki of 0.48 nM. It has over 74- and 350-fold selectivity against the other JAK family members, JAK3 and JAK1, respectively. Further, examination of > 450 other kinases did not reveal significant inhibitory activity for this JAK2 inhibitor. Functionally, BMS-911543 displayed potent anti-proliferative and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects in mutated JAK2-expressing cell lines dependent upon JAK2-STAT signaling and had little activity in cell types dependent upon other pathways such as JAK1 and JAK3. BMS-911543 was evaluated in colony growth assays using primary progenitor cells isolated from patients with JAK2 V617F -positive myeloproliferative disease (MPD) and resulted in an increased anti-proliferative response in MPD cells as compared with those from healthy volunteers. Similar to these in vitro observations, BMS-911543 was also highly active in in vivo models of JAK2-pSTAT signaling in multiple species (mouse, rat, dog and monkey) with sustained pathway suppression being observed after a single oral dose. Additionally, BMS-911543 was evaluated for effects in a JAK2 V617F -expressing SET-2 xenograft model system and displayed a minimally effective dose of <2 mg/kg on pSTAT5 pathway suppression, which lasted up to 8 hours. BMS-911543 was also compared to pan-JAK inhibitors in a mouse model of immunosuppression. At low dose levels active in JAK2-dependent PD models, no effects were observed on antigen-induced IgG and IgM production whereas a pan-JAK family inhibitor showed pronounced effects at all dose levels tested. The mechanistic selectivity of BMS-911543 to pan-JAK family inhibitors was extended through comparative analysis of these inhibitors in whole genome gene expression profiling experiments performed in sensitive cell types. In this comparison, BMS-911543 modulated a distinct subset of transcriptional changes as compared to pan-JAK inhibitors, thereby defining a minimal set of transcriptional changes underlying the pharmacologic effects of JAK2 inhibition. Collectively these results define the mechanistic basis for a differential therapeutic index between selective JAK2 and pan-JAK family inhibition pre-clinically and suggest a therapeutic rationale for the further characterization of BMS-911543 in patients with MPD and in other disorders characterized by constitutively active JAK2 signaling.
