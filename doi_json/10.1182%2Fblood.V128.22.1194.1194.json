    "abstract_text": "Background : Prior studies suggest that the presence of >5% polyclonal plasma cells (pPCs) among total plasma cells (PCs) within the bone marrow (BM) is associated with a longer progression-free survival, higher response rates, and lower frequency of high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). However, the incidence and prognostic utility of this factor in patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM has not been previously evaluated. Thus, we evaluated the prognostic value of quantifying the percentage of pPCs among the total PCs in the BM of patients with actively relapsing MM. Methods : We evaluated all MM patients with actively relapsing disease (biochemical and/or symptomatic) seen at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, from 2012 to 2013, who had BM samples evaluated by seven-color multiparametric flow cytometry. All patients had at least 24 months of follow-up from the date of flow evaluation. Cell surface antigens were assessed by direct immunofluorescence antibodies for CD45, CD19, CD38, CD138, cytoplasmic Kappa and Lambda Ig light chains, and DAPI nuclear stain. The flow cytometry data was collected using the Becton Dickinson FACSCanto II instruments that analyzed 150,000 events (cells); this data was then analyzed by multi-parameter analysis using the BD FACS DIVA Software. PCs were selectively analyzed through combinatorial gating using light scatter properties and CD38, CD138, CD19, and CD45. Clonal PCs were separated from pPCs based on the differential expression of CD45, CD19, DAPI (in non-diploid cases), and immunoglobulin light chains. The percentage of pPCs was calculated in total PCs detected. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and differences were assessed using the log rank test. Results : There were 180 consecutive patients with actively relapsing MM who had BM biopsies analyzed via flow cytometry as part of their routine clinical evaluation. The median age of this group was 65 years (range: 40 - 87); 52% were male. At the time of this analysis, 104 patients had died, and the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate for the cohort was 58%. The median number of therapies received was 4 (range: 1 - 15). Of these patients, 61% received a prior ASCT, and almost all (99%) received prior regimens containing either immunomodulators or proteasome inhibitors. There were 55 (30%) patients with >5% pPCs among the total PCs in their BM. The median percentage of pPCs among total PCs in these 55 patients was 33% (range: 5 - 99). The median OS for those with >5% pPCs was not reached compared with 22 months for those with <5% pPCs ( P = 0.028; Figure 1). Patients with <5% pPCs PCs had a higher likelihood of high-risk FISH cytogenetics compared with the rest of the patients. In a univariate analysis, increasing number of pPCs was associated with an improved OS, while higher labeling index, number of prior therapies, and the presence of high-risk FISH cytogenetics were associated with a worse OS. In a multivariate analysis, only the increasing number of pPCs ( P = 0.006), higher labeling index ( P = 0.0002) and number of prior therapies ( P = 0.003) retained statistical significance. Conclusion : Quantitative estimation of the percentage of pPCs among the total PCs in the BM of patients with actively relapsing MM was determined to be a predictor of worse OS. As such, this parameter is able to identify a group of patients with MM with actively relapsing disease who have a particularly poor outcome. Further studies evaluating its biological significance are warranted.
