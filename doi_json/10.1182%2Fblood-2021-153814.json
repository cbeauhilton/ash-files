    "abstract_text": "Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a rare genetic disease predominantly caused by mutations carried within one of at least 20 ribosomal genes. DBA is characterized by red blood cell aplasia and normal myeloid and megakaryocyte progenitors, indicating that early uncommitted progenitors are relatively unaffected by the mutations. In DBA, the formation of BFU-E colonies and subsequent erythroblasts are severely restricted and indicate a defect in one of the earliest stages of erythroid expansion. To identify critical molecular mechanisms that may regulate early erythropoiesis, we used shRNAs against the ribosomal protein RPS19 (the most commonly mutated gene in DBA) in cord blood derived CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and performed bulk RNA-seq. After 3 days in an erythroid culture media, the transcriptomes in CD71+ erythroid progenitors were examined. We found that the special AT binding protein 1 (SATB1) was downregulated in RPS19-insufficient HSPCs compared to healthy cord blood HSPCs. SATB1 is modestly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells but is induced during lymphoid expansion and has been previously reported to suppress myeloid/erythroid progenitor (MEP) expansion. Our results showed that maintaining SATB1 expression is required for optimal expansion of MEP progenitors and that the premature loss of SATB1 in DBA contributes to the anemia phenotype. SATB1 binds to 3 specific regions upstream of the 5'UTR of the HSP70 genes and induces the formation of 2 chromatin loops. An enhancer element associates with the proximal promoters of the two HSP70 genes and facilitates the induction of HSP70. In DBA, HSP70 is not induced and contributes to DBA pathogenesis. HSPA1A is induced 4.3-fold while HSPA1B is induced 3.1-fold. Increased expression of the master erythroid transcription factor GATA1 during erythropoiesis occurs in two phases. The first induction precedes a more dramatic induction that accompanies later stages of erythroid differentiation. The absence of SATB1 or HSP70 reduced the earlier GATA1 induction that accompany MEP expansion by 46.1% and 49.3% respectively. The number of MEPs in SATB1 knockdown HSPCs was reduced, resulting in a 24.5% reduction in CD235+ erythroid and 20.8% reduction in CD41+ megakaryocytes. While SATB1-independent effects of RPS19-insufficiency contribute more significantly to erythroid defects in DBA, we have uncovered that SATB1 contributes to regulation of the earliest stages of erythropoiesis by facilitating the induction of HSP70 and subsequent stabilization of an early induction of GATA1.
