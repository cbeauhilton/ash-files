    "abstract_text": "The impact of allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT) in comparison to conventional chemotherapy (CCT) in AML on quality of life remains unclear mainly due to a lack of studies with long term follow-up. Therefore the German AML-Intergroup initiated a survey on quality of life for patients treated within 1 of 8 German prospective multicenter treatment trials. All patients completed a self-report questionnaire either when they returned for follow-up outpatient visits or by mail. Patients completed the EORTC Quality of Life-Core Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) supplemented by self-assessed concomitant diseases, late treatment effects and demographic details including percentage of disability. 525 patients (median age: 46 years at diagnosis; median follow up period: 9 years) returned their questionnaires, 244 after SCT in 1. CR (189 allo; 55 auto) and 281 after CCT. Recovery-rate of the questionnaires was 55% ranging from 40% to 79% in the different trial cohorts. Due to low numbers after auto-SCT these patients were excluded from further analysis. The ECOG activity index revealed normal activity in 40% and 58% and disabled person card in 63% and 37% of the patients in the allo-SCT and CCT groups, respectively. Impaired vision, cataract surgery, chronic skin disorders and treatment of hormonal disorders were reported significantly more often in allo-SCT-patients, whereas osteoarthritis, cardiac insufficiency and unspecific back pain were slightly more frequent in CCT patients, mainly due to a higher median age in the CCT-group. All QLQC-30 functions except physical functioning and pain were in favor of CCT (p 45 years (odds-ratio 2.57 95%-CI 1.47\u20134.50) and Allo-SCT (odds ratio 2.10 95%-CI 1.20 \u2013 3.69) showed significant adverse effect on global health status. Similarly unfavorable effects were evaluated for actually concomitant disease and Allo-SCT on fatigue. These results indicate that Allo-SCT compared to intensive chemotherapy had a significant negative impact on quality of life and this needs to be considered when reviewing treatment options.",
