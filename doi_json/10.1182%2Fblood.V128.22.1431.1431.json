    "abstract_text": "Introduction Pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in women. Interestingly, preeclampsia, an extremely pro-inflammatory disorder specific to pregnancy is associated with a lower than expected increase in thrombotic risk compared to other proinflammatory disorders. The mechanism underling this lower thrombotic risk is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the coagulation balance, a major determinant of VTE risk, in early onset preeclampsia (EOP) patients. EOP is the most inflammatory form of preeclampsia, characterised by the development of hypertension and proteinuria prior to 34 weeks gestation. Methods Platelet-poor plasma was collected from patients with early onset preeclampsia (EOP n=26), matched pregnant (n=20) and non pregnant controls (n=16). Calibrated automated thrombography, an assay of thrombin generation and TFPI assays were performed. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Results During the study period, 15,299 women delivered and 40 patients developed EOP, of whom 26 were successfully recruited with consent. For comparison, 16 non pregnant controls and 20 pregnant controls were also recruited. When artefactual contact activation was inhibited by using corn trypsin inhibitor as anticoagulant, EOP patients were characterised by a decrease in the rate and extent of Tissue Factor (TF) thrombin generation compared to pregnant controls. There was a prolongation of the time to peak thrombin generation (16 \u00b1 4 minutes vs. 13 \u00b1 2 minutes, p < 0.05), a decrease in the velocity index (25 \u00b1 17nM/minute vs. 41 \u00b1 27nM/minute, p < 0.05), and a decrease in peak thrombin generation (150 \u00b1 80 nM IIa vs. 210 \u00b1 70 nM IIa, p < 0.05 ) in EOP compared to pregnant controls. This reduction in the rate and extent of thrombin generation was most amplified in patients with severe EOP (multi-organ involvement) compared with moderate EOP. This lower overall procoagulant state seen was further emphasised by the increase in sensitivity to the anticoagulant activity of exogenously added activated protein C and thrombomodulin observed in EOP. Again, the increased sensitivity to APC and thrombomodulin was most apparent in severe EOP cases. Previous studies have shown that preeclampsia is characterised by a increase in plasma TFPI activity. As such, we investigated whether increases in plasma TFPI activity explained the reduction in TF-dependent thrombin generation. Consistent with previous studies, plasma tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) levels and plasma TFPI activity significantly increased in EOP, most notably in severe EOP cases. There was a significant inverse correlation between total TFPI levels and peak thrombin generation (r 2 = -0.64, p < 0.05) and TFPI activity and peak thrombin generation (r 2 = -0.52, p < 0.05). The inhibition of TFPI with a polyclonal anti-TFPI antibody abolished the attenuation in thrombin generation seen in severe EOP. Conclusion In conclusion, TF-dependent thrombin generation is reduced in patients with early onset preeclampsia due to increases in plasma TFPI activity. These findings may partially explain the lower thrombosis risk observed in patients with early onset preeclampsia relative to comparable systemic proinflammatory conditions. These data also have future potential in helping clinicians to manage competing bleeding and thrombotic risks in these very high-risk patients. Disclosures Maguire: Actelion UK: Research Funding.
