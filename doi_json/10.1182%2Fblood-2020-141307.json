    "abstract_text": "Background- In patients with light chain amyloidosis (AL), t(11;14) detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the most common cytogenetic aberration. Several studies have shown that t(11;14) is associated with inferior outcomes in newly diagnosed AL patients [1, 2]. In contrast, at least one study in patients with t(11;14) who underwent high-dose therapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HCT) showed improved complete response (CR) rate and prolonged hematologic event-free survival[3]. In this single-center, retrospective analysis, we evaluated the outcome of patients with AL and t(11;14) who underwent auto-HCT at our institution. Method- We identified 122 consecutive patients with AL with cardiac or renal involvement who received an auto-HCT between 2011 and 2019. Baseline FISH data were available for 92 patients, 15 (16 %) of whom had t(11;14). Seventy-seven (84%) patients without t(11;14) were included as control . Hematologic and organ responses were evaluated according to the Consensus Guidelines for AL [4]. Revised Mayo staging system was utilized for Cardiac staging [5]. Result- The median age at auto-HCT was 60 years (range, 27 to 77). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups (Table 1). The median follow-up from auto-HCT was 28 months (range, 1 to 100). Overall, 40%, and 42% of patients with or without t(11;14), respectively ( p =0.573), received post-auto-HCT maintenance therapy. One-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 2%. The 1-year NRM was 0 and 2.6% (n=2) in patients with or without t(11;14) ( p =0.366). Hematologic CR after auto-HCT was seen in 7 (47%) and 33 (42%) patients with or without t(11;14), respectively ( p =0.78). Organ response (OR) after auto-HCT was seen in 10 (71%) and 50 (67%) patients with or without t(11;14), respectively ( p =0.586). The 2-year hematologic disease-free survival (Heme DFS) was 93% and 87% with or without t(11;14), respectively ( p =0.422). The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 92%, and 87% in patients with or without t(11;14) ( p =0.6) (Figure 1A).The 2-year overall survival was 100%, ad 87% in patients with or without t(11;14) ( p =0.2) (Figure 1B). Cardiac involvement with AL was associated with a shorter OS (p=0.012). Conclusion- In this single-center retrospective analysis, we showed that auto-HCT is safe and feasible in selected patients with AL and t(11;14), and these patients have comparable outcomes to patients without t(11;14).
