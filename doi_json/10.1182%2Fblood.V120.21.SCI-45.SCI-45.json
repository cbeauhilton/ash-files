    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-45 Clinical and epidemiological studies have long established a connection between obesity and thrombosis leading to increased cardiovascular complications, in part attributed to elevated expression of the prothrombotic molecules plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and circulating tissue factor (TF). Obesity also increases the risk for metabolic dysfunction, and emerging evidence indicates that coagulation proteases offer a range of signaling pathways that control multiple aspects of the metabolic syndrome, including weight gain, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and hepatic steatosis. While adipose inflammation due to recruitment and activation of macrophages and secretion of inflammatory cytokines promotes systemic hypercoagulability and insulin resistance, pathways that sustain adipose macrophage inflammation in obesity are unclear. Our studies suggest that TF signaling via the G-protein-coupled receptor, protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2), represents a novel link between obesity, coagulation, and associated adipose inflammation and insulin resistance. Mice lacking the cytoplasmic domain of TF or PAR2 were protected from high fat diet-induced weight gain, adipose inflammation, and insulin resistance. Genetic loss of TF cytoplasmic domain and PAR2 in myeloid cells attenuated adipose macrophage inflammation and increased insulin sensitivity, an effect that was also achieved by acute pharmacologic inhibition of TF-PAR2 signaling in macrophages. In contrast, TF signaling in nonhematopoietic cells specifically promoted obesity via its effects on energy metabolism. In adipocytes, TF-VIIa signaling suppressed basal and insulin-mediated AKT phosphorylation, with concordant transcriptional changes in genes regulating lipid and glucose metabolism. Thus, the procoagulant state induced by obesity can in fact contribute to the metabolic syndrome, and adipose TF signaling may be at the intersection between obesity, inflammation, and thrombosis.
