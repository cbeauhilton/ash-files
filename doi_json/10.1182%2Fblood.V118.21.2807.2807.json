    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2807 CCDC26 is a retinoic acid-dependent modulator of myeloid cell differentiation and death ( Yin W et al. Oncogene 2006 :25 :3735 ). CCDC26 maps to chromosome 8q24.21 and germline polymorphisms in the gene have been associated with low-grade gliomas ( Jenkins RB et al. Cancer Genetics 2011;204 :13 ), which in turn have recently been shown to frequently express IDH1 mutations ( Parsons D et al, Science 2008;321 :1807 ). More recently, we have discovered that CCDC26 SNP associations in gliomas are primarily restricted to patients with IDH1 mutations ( Jenkins et al. unpublished observations ). We therefore hypothesized that germline CCDC26 SNPS might be associated with patients with myeloid malignancies that harbor IDH1 mutations ( Mardis et al. NEJM 2009;361 :1058 ). Seventy-two IDH -mutated patients with chronic or blast phase myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemia (most constituting post-MPN events) were identified: 18 IDH1 R132, one IDH2 R172 and 53 IDH2 R140. These 72 patients and a control group of 153 IDH unmutated cases with myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic neoplasms (total n =225) were genotyped for CCDC26 risk alleles associated with IDH -mutated gliomas: rs10464870, rs891835 and rs4295627. The respective minor allele frequencies (MAF) were significantly different between IDH1 (11%, 8% and 6%) and IDH2 (30%, 27% and 24%) mutated cases (p=0.037, 0.040 and 0.021; OR 3.4, 3.7 and 6.1 with 95% CI of 1.1\u201310.5, 1.1\u201313.0 and 1.3\u201328.9) as well as between IDH - wild type (24%, 24% and 21%) and IDH1 -mutated (11%, 8% and 6%) cases (p=0.10, 0.043 and 0.035; OR 0.42, 0.29 and 0.21 with 95% CI of 0.15\u20131.19, 0.09\u20130.96 and 0.05\u20130.90). The MAF values in our IDH -unmutated cases were similar to that of population-based controls. However, the direction of SNP associations in IDH1 -mutated myeloid malignancies were opposite of those seen in IDH1 -mutated gliomas. Our observations suggest a differential effect of CCDC26 genetic polymorphisms in IDH1 -mutated myeloid malignancies compared to either their IDH2 R140-mutated or IDH1 -mutated gliomas. Such differences in genomic context might contribute to hitherto seen differences in prognostic impact between IDH2 R140 vs. IDH1 R132 vs. IDH2 R172, in AML ( Green CL et al.
