    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4694 Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) offers great promise for treating red blood cell disorders, inherited disorders of metabolism, autoimmune diseases, and inducing donor-specific tolerance to organ transplants. However, the widespread application of this approach is dependent upon the development of less toxic strategies for BMT and avoidance of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). CD8 + /TCR \u2212 facilitating cells (FC) facilitate engraftment of highly purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) across major histocompatibility complex barriers without causing GVHD. We previously reported that Flt3 ligand (FL) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) synergistically mobilize FC and HSC into the peripheral blood (PB). Recently, AMD 3100 has been found to be a rapid mobilizing agent whose effect occurs within hours after injection. It is a macrocyclic compound and potential fusion inhibitor that antagonizes CXCR4 alpha-chemokine receptor for its effect on HSC mobilization. CXCR4 and its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), are important in HSC homing and maintenance in the bone marrow microenvironment. Here, we investigated the effects of AMD 3100 on the mobilization of FC and HSC into PB in combination with FL and G-CSF. A dose titration of AMD 3100 was first performed. B6 mice were injected subcutaneously with AMD 3100 with the doses ranging from 1.25 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg. PB was obtained 0.5, 1, 3, and 6 hours post-injection. After individual count of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), cells were stained for flow cytometric analysis to enumerate FC (CD8 + /TCR \u2212 ). The numbers of PBMC significantly increased even 0.5 hour after AMD 3100 treatment and peaked at 1 h. The maximal mobilization of PBMC was noted at 1 h with 5.0 mg/kg AMD 3100. Treatment with 5.0 mg/kg AMD 3100 caused a 3.1-fold increase of WBC at 1h compared with saline treated controls. An increase of FC was detectable with all doses of AMD 3100. The numbers of FC peaked between 1 and 3 h, and declined rapidly to resemble saline-treated controls at 6 h after. A 5.9-fold increase of FC was observed at 1 h with 5.0 mg/kg AMD 3100 (P = 0.012). These data suggest that AMD 3100 is a potent cell mobilizer from bone marrow to PB. We next investigated the effect of AMD 3100 in combination with FL and G-CSF on the mobilization of FC and HSC into PB. B6 mice were injected with FL (day 1 to 10), G-CSF (day 4 to 10), and AMD 3100 (day 10). PB was obtained 1 h after injection on day 10. After performing a count of peripheral WBC, cells were stained for flow cytometric analysis to enumerate FC (CD8 + /TCR \u2212 ) and HSC (Lin \u2212 /Sca-1 + /c-kit + ) mobilization. The maximal mobilization of PBMC was observed when animals were treated with AMD 3100/FL/G-CSF. The numbers of PBMC with AMD3100/FL/G-CSF treatment increased with 17.2-fold and 6.4-fold when compared with controls treated with saline or AMD 3100 alone (P < 0.00001), respectively. A maximal elevation of both FC and HSC was detected when AMD 3100 was added to FL/G-CSF treatment and reached 1.91 \u00b1 0.42 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcl ( Figure 1 A) and 1.89 \u00b1 0.35 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcl ( Figure 1 B), respectively. The increase of FC and HSC was significant. There was a 10.1-fold increase in FC and 230.8-fold increase in HSC when compared with recipients treated with AMD 3100 alone (P < 0.00001). AMD 3100/FL/G-CSF treatment resulted in a 1.7-fold of FC and 2.2-fold increase of HSC when compared with recipients treated with FL/G-CSF (P < 0.05). In summary, AMD 3100, FL, and G-CSF show a highly significant synergy on the mobilization of FC and HSC. This study may be clinically relevant in efforts to mobilize immunomodulatory FC and HSC to PB for transplantation, especially to induce tolerance for organ transplant recipients.
