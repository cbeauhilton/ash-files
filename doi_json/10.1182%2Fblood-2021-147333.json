    "abstract_text": "CC-99282 is a novel, small molecule CELMoD \u00ae agent that co-opts cereblon to induce targeted degradation of Ikaros/Aiolos, transcription factors critical for development of B-cell malignancies. Lopez-Girona et al. reported that in preclinical models, compared with lenalidomide and other immunomodulatory agents, CC-99282 showed similar immunostimulatory effects and stronger antitumor activity along with robust distribution across multiple tissues. In addition, CC-99282 was shown to exhibit 10- to 100-fold enhanced antiproliferative and apoptotic activity in a range of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines, independent of subtype or chemotherapy-resistant status (Lopez-Girona, et al. Hematol Oncol . 2021). Here, we present results from CC-99282-NHL-001, a phase 1, open-label, dose-finding, first-in-human study evaluating CC-99282 in pts with R/R NHL (NCT03930953). This multicenter study consists of 2 parts, dose escalation of CC-99282 monotherapy (part A) and expansion with or without combination partners (part B). Part A includes pts with R/R DLBCL or follicular lymphoma (FL) who have progressed after \u2265 2 lines of therapy, including prior CELMoD agent and chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR T), or pts with R/R DLBCL who received \u2265 1 lines of standard therapy and are unfit for transplant. Pts receive oral CC-99282 (0.2 mg, 0.4 mg, 0.6 mg, or 0.8 mg) once daily following 3 different intermittent dosing schedules of 28-day cycles, with \u2265 3 pts in each dosing cohort. Primary objectives are to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and/or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D); secondary objectives include pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary efficacy of CC-99282 monotherapy in pts with R/R NHL. The pharmacodynamics (PD) of CC-99282 in R/R NHL is an exploratory endpoint. As of April 9, 2021, 35 eligible pts were treated in part A (30 DLBCL and 5 FL). Median age was 66 (range 35-81) years and 57% were male. Median number of prior anticancer therapies was 3 (range 1-8); 7 (20%) pts had received CAR T, 7 (20%) had received prior stem cell transplants, and 20 (57%) were refractory to last treatment. Median treatment duration was 8 (range 4-72) weeks, and at time of analysis 8 (23%) pts were still on treatment and 22 (63%) had discontinued treatment because of progressive disease. Twenty-one (60%) pts had a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) of grade 3/4 related to CC-99282, the most common being neutropenia (19 pts [54%]), thrombocytopenia (3 pts [9%]), and febrile neutropenia (2 pts [6%]). Dose-limiting toxicities observed have been hematologic TEAEs and the MTD has not been reached. Management of neutropenia included dose reductions and/or interruptions, and prophylaxis or treatment with colony-stimulating factors. At the tolerated schedules of dose levels \u2265 0.4 mg, CC-99282 monotherapy demonstrated an overall response rate of 40% (10/25 pts with objective responses including 3 FL, 1 FL grade IIIB, and 6 DLBCL), including complete responses in 3 pts and partial responses in 7 pts. Responses appeared durable with an observed range of 9-407 days, as of the cutoff date. Objective responses were observed in patients treated with prior CAR T or lenalidomide. Selection of the RP2D is pending and updated data for optimal dose regimen will be presented at ASH 2021. Interim PK analysis showed that CC-99282 was absorbed rapidly with a prolonged terminal half-life (median of ~ 50 hours at doses \u2265 0.4 mg) and excellent distribution into the peripheral compartment. Increase in plasma CC-99282 and degradation of Ikaros/Aiolos in peripheral T cells occurred in a dose-dependent manner where maximum degradation (> 90%) occurred by day 4 of treatment at doses \u2265 0.4 mg. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed immunostimulatory activity with increases in both T cell and natural killer cell compartments. The circulating tumor DNA analysis showed a reduction in the single nucleotide variants of tumor DNA as early as cycle 1 day 15 that correlated with response to CC-99282 treatment and suggested fast tumor cell-intrinsic activity. CC-99282 monotherapy showed a predictable and manageable safety profile and demonstrated promising efficacy in heavily pretreated pts with R/R NHL with PK/PD data consistent with robust CC-99282-mediated antitumor activity. This study is ongoing and actively enrolling additional cohorts.
