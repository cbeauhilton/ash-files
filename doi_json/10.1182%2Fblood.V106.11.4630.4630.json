    "abstract_text": "Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential treatment of newly diagnosed de novo AML patients with DA and CAG regimens as induction therapy. Methods Those who were newly diagnosed as de novo AML (FAB classification criteria) were enrolled and DA regimen chemotherapy were administered. Bone marrow aspirates were performed and BM smears were examined at 48 hours since the end of chemotherapy. If severe hypocellularities were not achieved, the percentage of blasts in BM was between 20%\u201360% and peripheral WBC was in the range of (0.5\u201310) x10 9 /L, the patients would receive CAG regimen therapy since 72 hours. Patients\u2019 general status and the important parameters, such as peripheral blood count, liver function, renal function, thrombosis and hemostasis parameters were monitored throughout the course of the treatment and thereafter. When the clinical symptoms were relieved and peripheral blood counts returned to normal, or it was the end of the second or third week since the end of the CAG regimen, Bone marrow were examined again to evaluate the efficacy of the sequential therapy. Results 14 patients consisted of 9 male and 5 female patients were enrolled. Out of them, 2 were M1, 5 M2, 4 M4 and 3 M5 according to FAB classification criteria. Median of blasts in BM were 38.5%(20%\u201360%) before CAG regimen. Of the 14 patients, 10 reached CR, 2 PR and 2 NR. CR rate was 71.4% (10/14) and total response rate was 85.7%(12/14). Time to achieve CR was on 15th(14th\u201329th)day medianly since the end of the treatment. During the CAG therapy courses, the nadir of peripheral blood cell counts and the time when it occurred were as follows: WBC 1.0(0.2\u20133.5)(x10 9 /L),10(1\u201323)(d); Hb 57.5(44\u201369) (g/L), 10(1\u201327)(d)and PLT 11.5(10\u201365)(x10 9 /L), 12(3\u201323)(d), respectively. Neutropenia (WBC<1.0x10 9 /L) and thrombocytopenia (PLT<20.0x10 9 /L) were lasted for 0(0\u201324) and 11(0\u201321)days, respectively. Median units of transfusions of platelets and red blood cells required by each patient were 3(0\u201310)(u) and 4(0\u201312)(u), respectively. The most commonly observed side effect of the regimen was bone marrow proliferation inhibition. Infections, usually respiratoy tract infections, were the second. However, sepsis was rare, which appeared in 1 out of 14 patients. Conclusions DA and CAG regimens sequential treatment as remission induction chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnose de novo AML was highly effective and well tolerated. It would be beneficial for those who might not be sensitive enough to DA regimen chemotherapy only.",
