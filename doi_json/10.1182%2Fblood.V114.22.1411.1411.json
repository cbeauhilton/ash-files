Therefore, we conducted the epidemiologic study to survey the frequency and related factors of neutropenia in general Thai population. Method: Blood samples from healthy Thai citizens resided in Bangkok and 4 provinces from different areas were collected from October 2008-May 2009. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1.50 \u00d710 9 /l was used as the cut-off point for neutropenia. [1] Results: Six thousand nine hundred and seventy one samples were analyzed. There were 2,422 male and 4,549 female. The median age was 49 years (range 15-93 years). The subjects from Bangkok (n=4,297) are younger and are more commonly male compared to those from non-urban areas (n=2,674) (p<0.01). The overall mean white blood cell count (WBC) and ANC were 7.57\u00b14.07 \u00d710 9 /l (mean \u00b1 2SD) and 4.18 \u00b13.05 \u00d710 9 /l (mean \u00b1 2SD), respectively. The prevalence of neutropenic cases were 0.43% (30 cases, 95%CI 0.41-0.44). The mean percentage of the circulating neutrophil count was 54.58\u00b117.25% (mean \u00b1 2SD). It was notable that 1.87% of the participants had the circulating WBC \u2265 12.6 \u00d710 9 /l. There was no influence of age, sex or survey sites on the prevalence of neutropenia. The neutropenia subjects defined as ANC lower than 2SD of the studied populations (1.13 \u00d710 9 /l) were only 8 cases (0.11%). The prevalence of cases, which ANC < 1.0 and 0.5 \u00d710 9 /l, were 0.03% and 0% respectively. Conclusion: The frequency of asymptomatic neutropenia in Thai was 0.43% defined by ANC < 1.50 \u00d710 9 /l. Compared with the previous largest population report [1] , the prevalence were lower than that of American white (0.79%, 95%CI 0.57-1.01), African American (4.47%95%CI 3.92-5.02) and similar to Mexican American (0.38%, 95%CI 0.24-0.52). The underlying cause of these racial discrepancies remains to be explored. [1] Hsieh MM, Everhart JE, Byrd-Holt DD, Tisdale JF, Rodgers GP.
