    "abstract_text": "Menorrhagia is a common clinical problem among reproductive age women and annually 5% of reproductive age women seek medical attention, usually with gynecologists and other primary care physicians, for this symptom. Since underlying bleeding disorders are common in women presenting with menorrhagia, and referral for comprehensive hemostatic testing of substantial numbers of women with otherwise unexplained menorrhagia is problematic from the public health and cost perspective, a short, easy-to-administer screening tool comprised of 8 questions for identifying women with menorrhagia for hemostatic evaluation was previously developed ( Am J Ob Gyn  2008 ; 198 : e1 \u2013163e8 ). In the present study, the validity of the screening tool was evaluated in a multi-site, prospectively recruited cohort of women with menorrhagia. 232 women with menorrhagia age 18 and older with a pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC) score > 100 were recruited from 5 US centers as potential subjects for a prospective cross-over study for evaluation of intranasal DDAVP versus tranexamic acid. All subjects underwent comprehensive laboratory testing for bleeding disorders, including VWF, platelet aggregation/ATP release, and factor assays. Study participants were administered a questionnaire which included the 8 screening tool questions in 4 categories, including history of duration and severity of menorrhagia, anemia treatment, excessive bleeding with hemostatic challenges, and family diagnosis of bleeding disorder. A screening tool was considered positive if there was a positive response for any of the questions in the four categories. Sensitivity of the screening tool with 95% confidence interval was calculated for bleeding disorders and also separately for low VWF (ristocetin cofactor < 50%), and platelet function defects.217 women with menorrhagia including 78% white and 16% black women with complete data were evaluated. In this population, a positive screening tool had a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI, 83\u201393) for bleeding disorders, 89% for platelet function defects (95% CI, 82\u201394), and 73% for low VWF (95% CI, 39\u201394). The sensitivity for bleeding disorders was 87% (95% CI, 79\u201392) among white women and 94% (95% CI, 79\u201399) among black women. Adding a PBAC score > 185 increased the sensitivity of the screening tool for bleeding disorders to 95% (95% CI, 90\u201398). Using a multi-site US population of adult women with menorrhagia, this study confirms the benefit of a short screening tool to assist primary care physicians in the selection of women with menorrhagia to refer for comprehensive hemostatic testing and evaluation. population of adult women with menorrhagia, this study confirms the benefit of a short screening tool to assist primary care physicians in the selection of women with menorrhagia to refer for comprehensive hemostatic testing and evaluation.",
