    "abstract_text": "Graft versus host disease (GVH) incidence and severity increases with older patient age. Host dendritic cells (DC) are responsible for initiating GVH, presumably as a result of activation at the time of transplant conditioning (as they are short lived after transplantation). Age-related alterations in host DC function have not been studied in a transplant setting. In this study, young (8\u201314 wk) and older (12\u201316 mo) mice were treated with the conditioning regimen of lethal irradiation (1100 cGy) and assessed at 6 h later for changes in DC costimulatory molecule expression and cytokine secretion. Older mice had slightly higher numbers of splenic classical DC (cDC; CD11c hi Cl II + B220 \u2212 ) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC; CD11c lo Cl II lo B220 + ) both before and after irradiation. No differences were observed in CD40, CD80, or CD86 expression between young and older mice, either before or after irradiation. IL-12, IFN\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1 producing cDC were more numerous in young untreated mice than in older mice. However, these cells decreased in young mice and increased in older mice after irradiation, resulting in generally higher numbers of cells producing these cytokines in older mice. IL-12, IFN\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1 producing pDC were more frequent in older mice than in young mice prior to irradiation, and both older and young mice showed increased frequency of cells producing these cytokines after irradiation. Overall, the highest numbers of cDC and pDC producing IL-12, IFN\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1 were present in older mice after irradiation. In both cDC and pDC populations, older mice had a higher frequency of IL-10 + cells prior to irradiation. After irradiation, young mice had a higher frequency of IL-10 + cells. These findings indicate that the balance of cytokine production in older mice after conditioning with irradiation is shifted to immunostimulatory cytokines rather than immunosuppressive cytokines. Murine GVH can be prevented by treatment with regulatory DC (rDC) in young animals (Sato et al., Immunity 2003). To determine whether this treatment is feasible in older animals, older BALB/c mice were transplanted with young C57Bl/6 BM. A subset of each group received age-matched host derived rDC. As expected, among mice that did not receive rDC, old recipients got more rapid and severe GVH than young recipients. This correlated with an increased frequency of residual host DC at the time of GVH in the older group. rDC were used to successfully treat GVH in older (as well as young) transplant recipients. These results provide the foundation for a cell based therapeutic approach to the treatment of GVH in older individuals.",
