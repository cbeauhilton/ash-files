    "abstract_text": "Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is a serious complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). The physiology of GVHD is dominated by alloactivated donor T cells, yet current treatments are often nonspecific and offer limited efficacy with relatively high toxicities. We screened for novel drug targets in alloactivated T cells in a murine allo-BMT model using a flow cytometric technique for the in vivo analysis of intracellular signaling. We defined the signaling profile of normal T cells and alloreactive T cells during GVHD, focusing on pathways involved in T cell receptor (TCR), costimulatory, and cytokine signaling. This analysis revealed that although proteins in multiple pathways (MAP kinases, PI3K, Jak/STAT signaling) were all heavily phosphorylated in alloactivated T cells, phosphorylation of STAT-3 and ERK1/2 were particularly prominently increased in donor alloactivated CD4 T cells. We further analyzed the importance of STAT-3 and ERK1/2 signaling in alloactivated T cells via the use of small-molecule inhibitors of STAT-3 (curcurbitacin E/I) and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (SL327). Treatment with these inhibitors attenuated T cell proliferation in response to anti-CD3+CD28 stimulation and in mixed leukocyte reactions in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion (figure 1).

To rule out any direct toxicity, we analyzed recovered cells for apoptosis by Annexin-V staininga dn detected no significant toxicity (figure 2).

STAT-3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation may also represent potential targets to selectively inhibit donor T cell alloactivation and proliferation in GVHD.",
