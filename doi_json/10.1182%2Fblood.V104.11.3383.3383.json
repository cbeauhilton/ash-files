    "abstract_text": "The RUNX1/AML1 gene is essential for hematopoiesis and is most frequently involved in human leukemias. Loss-of-function of RUNX1 is the common underlying mechanism of RUNX leukemias: those carrying t(8;21), inv(16) and RUNX1 point mutations. As the weakest mode, haploinsufficiency of RUNX1/AML1 causes familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia (FPD/AML). Mice heterozygous for Runx1 null mutation, Runx1+/\u2212, appear genetically equivalent to human FPD/AML patients, but showed no apparent defects and did not develop spontaneous leukemia, implying that additional genetic alterations are required for leukemia. To identify such abnormalities, retroviral insertional mutagenesis was employed by using BXH2 mice that have spontaneously transmittable ecotropic retrovirus. BXH2-Runx1+/\u2212 mice showed a shorter disease latency and more myeloid-specific phenotype than wild-type littermates. Therefore, BXH2-Runx1+/\u2212 mice appear to serve as the mouse model for FPD/AML to investigate myeloid leukemia. The genes selectively affected in BXH2-Runx1+/\u2212 mice by retroviral integration are likely to cooperate with Runx1+/\u2212. c-Kit locus was involved twice in 24 BXH2-Runx1+/\u2212 but neither in 17 wild-type littermates nor in 135 inbred BXH2 mice reported in the RTCGD database, suggesting that c-KIT mutation cooperates with RUNX alteration in human leukemia. In fact, constitutively active mutants of c-KIT or functionally equivalent FLT3, were found in 10 out of 25 (40%) of human RUNX leukemias. Together, BXH2-Runx1+/\u2212 system appears useful to identify the genes cooperating with RUNX1 abnormalities.",
