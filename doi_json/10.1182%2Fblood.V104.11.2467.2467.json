    "abstract_text": "Arsenic trioxide (ATO) induces apoptosis of plasma cells through a number of mechanisms including inhibiting DNA binding by NF-\u03baB. These results suggest that this agent may be synergistic when combined with other active anti-myeloma drugs. To evaluate this we examined the effect of ATO alone and in combination with anti-myeloma treatments evaluated in vitro with MTT assays and using our severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)-hu murine myeloma models. First, we determined the effects of combining ATO with bortezomib or melphalan on the myeloma cell lines RPMI8226 and U266. Cell proliferation assays demonstrated marked synergistic anti-proliferative effects of ATO at concentrations ranging from 5x10 \u22125 M \u2013 5x10 \u22129 M and melphalan concentrations ranging from 3x10 \u22125 M \u2013 3x10 \u22129 M. Similar effects were observed when these cell lines were treated with bortezomib and varying concentrations of ATO (5x10 \u22125 M \u2013 5x10 \u221210 M). We also investigated the potential of ATO to increase the efficacy of anti-myeloma therapies in our SCID-hu murine model LAG\u03bb\u20131 (Yang H et al. Blood 2002). Each SCID mouse was implanted with a 0.5 cm 3 LAG\u03bb\u20131 tumor fragment into the left hind limb muscle. Mice were treated with ATO alone at 6.0 mg/kg, 1.25 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, and 0.05 mg/kg intraperitoneally (IP) daily x5/week starting 19 days post-implantation. Mice receiving the highest dose of ATO (6.0 mg/kg) showed marked inhibition of tumor growth and reduction of paraprotein levels while there was no effect observed in all other treatment groups. Next, 27 days following implantation of our LAG\u03bb\u20131 intramuscular (IM) tumor, LAG\u03bb\u20131 mice were treated with ATO (1.25 mg/kg) IP, bortezomib (0.25 mg/kg), or the combination of both drugs at these doses in the schedules outlined above. ATO or bortezomib treatment alone had no anti-myeloma effects at these low doses consistent with our previous results whereas there was a marked decrease in both tumor volume (57%) and paraprotein levels (53%) in mice receiving the combined therapy. The combination of melphalan and ATO was also evaluated in this model. LAG\u03bb\u20131 bearing mice received therapy with melphalan IP x1/weekly at 12.0 mg/kg, 6.0 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, and 0.06 mg/kg starting 22 days post-implantation and showed no anti-myeloma effects. Twenty-eight days following implantation of LAG\u03bb\u20131 tumor, mice received ATO (1.25 mg/kg) or melphalan (0.6 mg/kg) alone at doses without anti-myeloma effects, or the combination of these agents at these doses. The animals treated with these drugs alone showed a similar growth and increase in paraprotein levels to control mice whereas the combination of ATO and melphalan at these low doses markedly suppressed the growth of the tumor by >50% and significantly reduced serum paraprotein levels. These in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the addition of ATO to other anti-myeloma agents is likely to result in improved outcomes for patients with drug resistant myeloma. Based on these results, these combinations are now in clinical trials with promising early results for patients with drug resistant myeloma.",
