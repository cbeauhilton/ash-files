    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2014 Platelet activation by outside-in signaling is initiated by the binding of fibrinogen to alphaIIbbeta3, an integrin only expressed in platelets and megakaryocytes. Signals transduced by alphaIIbbeta3 regulate actin cytoskeleton resulting in filopodia and lamellipodia formation, cell spreading and retraction. c-Cbl protein is abundantly expressed in platelets and functions as E3 ubiquitin ligase and scaffolding protein to mediate protein-protein interactions. Importantly, c-Cbl tyrosine 731 has been shown to interact with p85 subunit of phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) modulating the actin cytoskeleton. Although previous reports showed c-Cbl activation downstream of alphaIIbbeta3, the mechanisms and implications of this activation or the downstream targets remain to be elucidated. We have studied the role of c-Cbl in platelet outside-in signaling: Using human platelets we have demonstrated that c-Cbl Y700, Y731 and Y774 residues undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon platelet adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen. These phosphorylation events are completely inhibited in the presence of the pan Src Family Kinases (SFKs) inhibitor (PP2) suggesting that c-Cbl is phosphorylated downstream of SFKs. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is also involved in this signaling pathway since its inhibition significantly reduce c-Cbl phosphorylation at residues Y774 and Y700; interestingly, tyrosine 731 phosphorylation, which allows the interaction with the p85-subunit of PI3K, is not affected by Syk inhibition. The physiological role of c-Cbl in platelet outside-in signaling was studied using c-Cbl knock-out mice. We found that in contrast to WT platelets, c-Cbl KO platelets had a significantly reduced spreading over a fibrinogen-coated surface. Furthermore, clot retraction analysis demonstrated that c-Cbl KO platelets retraction time was delayed when compared to WT platelets, suggesting a retraction defect. To further elucidate the physiological role of c-Cbl-PI3K interaction we used a knock-in mouse in which the c-Cbl residue Y 731 was substituted with phenylalanine (Y731F) thereby abolishing the PI3K binding site on c-Cbl. Importantly, platelets from Y731F mice showed spreading and clot retraction defect that were comparable with the c-Cbl KO. These result indicates that in large part, the role of c-Cbl in platelets outside-in signaling is determined by its interaction with PI3K. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that c-Cbl plays an important role in platelet outside-in signaling, and its interaction with PI3K through tyrosine 731 is of pivotal importance in platelet spreading and retraction.
