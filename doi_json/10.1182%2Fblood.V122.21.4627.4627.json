    "abstract_text": "Background HSCT recipients have increased incidence of acquiring infections, particularly by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcal pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Delayed immune reconstitution has a pivotal role in these complications. Although T-cell immune reconstitution has been well studied, long-term B-cell reconstitution remains less characterized. Patients and Methods We studied 73 patients, who received allogeneic HSCT at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. Patients were in complete remission of their underlying disorder and with median follow up 4.15 years [yrs] (range 6 month -18yrs, mean 5 yrs) post-HSCT. All subjects were< 18 years of age. B (naive [IgD+CD27-CD19+], memory [IgD+CD27+CD19+] and switched memory [IgD-CD27+CD19]); and T (CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD4+CD25+CD127dim (T Regulatory) [Tregs], RA+CD4+) cell subtypes, quantitative Immunoglobulins levels and antibodies to both polyribosyle polyphospate (PRP) and tetanus toxoid (TT) antigens were assessed longitudinally after HSCT. Results Naive B Cells were the first B cell subtype to return to normal value at 6 month post-HSCT, while memory B cells were persistently low up to two years post-HSCT. PRP levels continued to be low up to 10 years post -HSCT in unrelated donor HSCT recipients. TT antibodies level was normal at 6 month post-HSCT following immunization with TT in patients not receiving IVIG therapy. Switched memory B cell counts correlated positively with RA+CD4+ counts at 6 month post-HSCT (r=0.459, P=0.021) and with CD3+CD+4 counts at 6 months (r=0.530, P=0.006) and 2-years post-HSCT (r=0.398, P=0.016). However, switched memory B cells did not correlate with Tregs at any time post-HSCT. Switched memory B cells correlated positively with serum level of IgG at 1 (r=0.443, P=0.039), and 2 years post transplantation (r=0.617, P=0.001) and with serum level of IgA at 2 years post-HSCT(r=0.567. P=0.004). Memory B-cells counts correlated positively with serum levels of IgM at 1 year post-HSCT (r=0.478, P=0.021) and with serum levels of both IgG and IgA (r=0.431 P=0.035, and r=0.416, P=0.043, respectively) at 2 years post-HSCT. However, memory B-cell counts did not correlate with RA+CD4+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+ or Tregs cell counts. The use of Total body irradiation (TBI) was associated with lower switched memory B cells at 2 years (P=0.01) post-HSCT. TBI recipients also have lower PRP levels at 6-month post-HSCT compared to patients who did not receive TBI. Age of the recipient at time transplantation is another independent factor affecting all the B cell subsets recovery after transplantation; increase in age at transplantation is associated with lower B cell recovery. Decreased memory B cells post-HSCT was observed in patients with history of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) (P=0.034) and chronic GVHD (P=0.01), even after resolution of clinical manifestations of active GVHD at 6 month and 2 years follow up, respectively. Compared to cord blood graft recipients, Bone marrow graft recipients have increased switched memory B-cells at 6 month and higher (P=0.0001) PRP antibodies titer at 3 years post-HSCT, respectively. Patients who did not receive ATG or Alemtuzumab have increased recovery of naive B-cells (P=0.024) at 2 years post-transplantation. Patients received ATG have higher both naive B cells in univariate analysis and PRP levels (in multivariate analysis) than those received Alemtuzumab at 6 months post-HSCT. Multivariate regression analysis showed that patients received Alemtuzumab have higher TT antibodies titer at 6 month post -HSCT compared to those received ATG. Conclusion We have found that memory and switched memory B-cells and serum PRP levels are deficient post-HSCT in children. Switched memory B cells correlated positively with serum level of IgG and IgA and memory B-cells correlated positively with serum levels of IgM, IgG and IgA. This confirms that HSCT recipients have impaired humoral immune reconstitution, hindering both B-cells development and generation of immunoglobulins. We also studied the different factors affecting humoral immune reconstitution using backwards multivariate regression analysis model and found that the use of TBI, age of the recipient at transplantation, GVHD status and source of stem cells can affect the kinetics of humoral immune reconstitution after HSCT in children.
