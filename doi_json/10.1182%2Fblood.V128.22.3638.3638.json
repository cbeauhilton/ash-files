    "abstract_text": "Molecules of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), and in particular specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, have been proposed in the pathophysiology of immune and vascular alterations leading to vasoocclusive crises (VOC) and stroke in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Endothelial cells express MHC molecules following exposure to cytokines. SCD is characterized, in part, by vascular endothelial cell activation, increased oxidative stress, sickle cell adhesion and excess levels of the potent mitogen, endothelin-1 (ET-1). ET-1 activates endothelial cells, induces oxidative stress and inflammation in the vascular wall and regulates erythrocyte homeostasis. However, the role of ET-1 on MHC regulation in SCD is not clear. We first characterized the effect of ET-1 on MHC expression in the human endothelial cell line, EA.hy926. We observed dose-dependent increases in the expression of MHC class I (HLA-A2 4.8 \u00b1 2.1 folds p<0.01 n=4), MHC class II (HLA-DR 4.4 \u00b1 1.7 folds p<0.01 n=4) and MHC transcription factor (CIITA 3.5 \u00b1 1.8 folds p<0.05 n=4) in EA.hy926 cells. ET-1-stimulated expression of HLA-A2, HLA-DR and CIITA were significantly blocked by pre-incubation of cells with 10 \u00b5M BQ788, a selective blocker of ET-1 type B receptors (p<0.01, n=4). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies in EA.hy926 cells showed that ET-1 increased Histone H3 acetylation of the promoter region within MHC molecules (HLA-A2 62% \u00b1 5%, HLA-DRB 33% \u00b1 18%, p<0.01, n=4); an event that was likewise blocked by BQ788. We then studied two sickle transgenic knockout mouse models of moderate to severe disease phenotype, \u03b2S Antilles and Berkeley (BERK) mice, respectively. We observed significant increases in MHC molecule, H2-Aa mRNA levels (n=7; p<0.01) in spleens from sickle transgenic mice when compared to transgenic knockout mice expressing human hemoglobin A (HbA). We then treated BERK, \u03b2S Antilles and HbA mice for 14 days with ET-1 receptor antagonists and observed significant reductions in H2-Aa mRNA levels in spleen tissue from sickle transgenic mice but not in HbA mice (n=7; p<0.05). These results implicate ET-1 as a novel regulator of MHC molecules and suggest that ET-1 receptor blockade represents a promising therapeutic approach to regulate both immune and vascular responses in SCD.
