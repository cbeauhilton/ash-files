    "abstract_text": "Numerous potential intervention points exist within coagulation pathways for development of novel anticoagulant agents. To help determine the most suitable target for the discovery of novel antithrombotic agents, we have implemented an antisense strategy to specifically deplete levels of various coagulation factors in mice. Here we report the effects of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting factors II, VII, and IX on target RNA and protein levels in mice, as well as PT/aPTT. ISIS 401025 targeting factor II, ISIS 403102 targeting factor VII, and ISIS 402618 targeting factor IX dose-dependently suppressed their respective target transcript levels in a specific manner in primary mouse hepatocytes. Following subcutaneous administration to mice, each ASO reduced target RNA levels in liver and target protein levels in plasma in a specific and dose-dependent fashion (ED95 of approximate 25 mg/kg for each ASO). In conjunction with these effects, clotting times were also prolonged in a similar dose responsive fashion. Both PT and aPTT were increased following factor II inhibition and a PT-INR of 2.5 was achieved at 25 mg/kg, corresponding to a reduction in prothrombin transcript of 95%. As expected following factor VII ASO treatment, PT was significantly increased, while aPTT was unchanged. Conversely, following factor IX ASO treatment, aPTT was marginally but significantly prolonged, while PT was unchanged. These results demonstrate the capability of ASOs to dose-dependently and specifically modulate coagulation factor activity depletion and support the ASO approach as a novel strategy for the discovery of novel anticoagulation agents. Studies are in progress to assess relative safety and to expand the anticoagulation profile in mice for each of the factors under study.",
