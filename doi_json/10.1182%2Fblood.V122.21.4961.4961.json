    "abstract_text": "Objective This paper probes into the impact of P16 gene deletion on the prognosis of children and adults B-ALL. Method With the adoption of the Flow Cytometry, G-banding Technique Karyotype Analysis and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) technology, this paper will retrospectively analyze the clinical data of the immunological and cytogenetic detection to the total 124 initial onset B-ALL patients, who were treated in our hospital from January 2006 to December 2008, including children (73 cases, median age 6 years old) and adults (51 cases, median age 29 years). Result With the adoption of the I-FISH technology, the result data of the survey are exemplified as follows: in the group of 73 cases of child B-ALL patients, the incidence of P16 gene homozygous deletion, loss of heterozygosity and non-deletion are 13.7% (7 cases), 5.9% (3 cases), 80.4% (41 cases); in the group of 51 cases of adults, they are 13.7% (7 cases), 5.9% (3 cases), 80.4% (41 cases). In this data,recurrence rate in patients with p16 gene deletion is 43.5% (10 cases) in group of children, which is lower than that 90.0% (9 cases) in group of adults. The difference is statistically significant ( P = 0.013 ). Overall Survival (OS) is compared in patients of children and adults with and without p16 gene deletion. The result shows that children aged from 1 to 14 with p16 gene deletion have lower Overall Survival (OS) than that without p16 gene deletion ( P = 0.013). And it is the same in adult patients older than or are 15 years old ( P = 0.020). The long-term disease-free survival DFS is no significant difference ( P = 0.154) between that with and without p16 gene deletion in child group. On the contrary, the P16 gene deletion DFS is significantly lower than those without it in the adult group ( P <0.001). Conclusion p16 gene deletion in B-ALL patients of children and adults is equally poor prognostic factors. Consequently, it is significant for the assessing prognosis and guiding clinical treatment by making a definite status of the p16 gene deletion.
