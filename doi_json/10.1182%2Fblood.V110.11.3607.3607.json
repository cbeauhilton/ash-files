    "abstract_text": "Background: In patients (pts) with newly diagnosed myeloma (MM) eligible for high dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), the standard approach is 4\u20136 months of induction therapy followed by ASCT. The combination of thalidomide and dexamethasone is one of the commonly used induction regimens, and has superior response rates compared to dexamethasone or VAD. Almost all patients undergoing an ASCT relapse at a median interval of 18\u201324 months. The choice of treatments at first relapse is variable, but re-application of the original induction regimen, if effective is often considered. It is not clear if the responses obtained at the time of induction therapy can be replicated at the time of relapse. We studied the response of thalidomide based regimens when used as first treatment after relapse from an ASCT in patients receiving thalidomide as induction treatment. Methods: Pts who received thalidomide and dexamethasone as induction therapy, and thalidomide \u00b1 dexamethasone at first relapse after ASCT were identified for the current study. A group of patients receiving dexamethasone as induction therapy and thalidomide \u00b1 dexamethasone at first relapse after ASCT was used as the control group. Results: There were 20 pts in the study group (group 1) and 14 patients in the control group (group 2) identified between 2002 and 2007. There were 15 (75%) males in group 1 and 10 (71%) in group 2. In group 1 there was 1(5%) complete response (CR), 5 (25%) very good partial response (VGPR) and 14 (70%) partial responses (PR) to induction therapy. In group 2 there was 1 (7%)VGPR, 12 (86%) PR and 1 (7%)stable disease following dexamethasone induction. Upon treatment with thalidomide based regimens at first relapse after ASCT, there was a high rate of treatment failures in group 1 as compared to group 2 (no response in 14 out of 20 patients (70%) versus 5 of 14 pts (35%), respectively, p = 0.04). Of the 10 patients with progressive disease in group 1 post transplant, 30% had previously achieved a VGPR and 70% had previously achieved a PR to thalidomide/dexamethasone pre-ASCT. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence toward the lack of efficacy of thalidomide based regimens on post ASCT relapse in patients who had thalidomide responsive disease prior to ASCT. It is possible that this applies to other induction regimens when used at post ASCT relapse and raises the possibility of selection of drug resistant clones with initial therapy. Response rates seen with drug regimens prior to ASCT may not be reproducible at the time of relapse after ASCT."
