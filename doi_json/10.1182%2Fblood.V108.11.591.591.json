    "abstract_text": "Adenoviruses remain a major cause of mortality and morbidity in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. To date, no effective anti-adenoviral treatment is available, presenting a potential role for adoptive T cell therapy, as an increased risk of infection may be correlated with lack of endogenous T cell immunity. Therefore the goal of this project was to evaluate the use of adenovirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines for the prophylaxis and treatment of adenoviral infections post-HSCT. CTLs are initiated by stimulation with donor-derived mononuclear cells transduced with a recombinant adenovirus type 5 vector pseudotyped with a type 35 fiber (MOI 200 virus particles (vp) per cell). Responder cells are expanded by weekly restimulation with autologous EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) transduced with the same vector using an MOI of 500 vp. Nine of the 11 CTL lines manufactured for clinical use were predominantly CD4+ (range 12\u201395%), but all had a CD8+ component (range 3.5\u201379%). In chromium release assays, all CTL lines showed specific killing of both adenovirus and EBV antigen-bearing target cells. Recognition of adenovirus and EBV targets was not significantly different; at 20:1 effector:target ratio there was 18.5 \u00b1 14% specific lysis of adenovirus targets and 23 \u00b1 15% lysis of EBV targets while uninfected recipient target cells were not lysed (1.5 \u00b1 2%). We identified the hexon as the immunodominant target antigen in the CTL lines. To test the hypothesis that these polyclonal CD4 + and CD8 + hexon-specific T cells can provide protection against adenovirus infections in HSCT recipients, we administered donor-derived bi-virus-specific CTL lines to pediatric recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplant. So far, we have treated 7 patients in this phase I dose escalation study (using the continual reassessment model); 2 patients on dose level 1 (5x10 6 /m 2 ), 2 on dose level 2 (1.5x10 7 /m 2 ) and 2 on dose level 3 (4.5x10 7 /m 2 ). Of 6 patients who received CTL as prophylaxis, all remain negative for adenovirus and EBV and there were no adverse events attributable to CTL infusion. Post-infusion, samples for immune monitoring were collected for at least 3 months and analyzed by pentamer and IFN-g ELISPOT assays in batches to minimize inter-assay variablility. An increase in the frequency of EBV-specific T cells could be detected in the blood by 2 weeks post infusion in all evaluated patients, likely due to the presence of this latent virus in all patients. However, there was no significant rise in the adenovirus-specific T cell frequency post-infusion. The seventh patient received the bi-virus-specific CTL at a dose of 5x10 6 /m 2 as treatment for adenovirus disease. This patient had adenoviral pneumonia requiring ventilatory support. Following the CTL infusion the patient made a dramatic clinical recovery, was weaned off mechanical ventilation, and discharged a month after the infusion. In contrast to the prophylaxis group, this patient had a substantial rise in adenovirus-specific T cells detected in the peripheral blood by 4 weeks post-CTL infusion, which coincided with his clinical recovery and clearance of the virus from the tracheal aspirate, suggesting that the infused cells were effective in vivo . Adoptive immunotherapy for adenovirus appears to be safe but expansion of adenovirus-specific CTL in vivo may require the presence of antigen to stimulate the infused cells."
