    "abstract_text": "Treatment with single agent rituximab is associated with overall response (OR) rate of 15\u201335% in previously treated patients and up to 44% in untreated patients with CLL. The majority of the responses are partial (PR). GM-CSF was found to increase surface CD20 expression in vitro and potentiate ADCC and therefore improve the efficacy of rituximab. The combination of rituximab and GM-CSF has been investigated in follicular lymphomas and found to be associated with significant responses ( McLaughlin et al. Ann. Oncol 16 : v68 , 2005 ). Therefore, we designed a phase II study of rituximab plus GM-CSF in CLL. Patients were eligible for this study if they belonged to one of the following: Group 1: previously untreated patients, Rai stage 0-II and b2M >3 mg/mL, B symptoms or significant fatigue. Group 2: previously untreated patients \u2265 70 years with indication for treatment (NCI-WG criteria). Group 3: previously treated patients with evidence of active disease (NCI-WG criteria). All patients received 4 weekly infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m2 plus GM-CSF 250 mcg sc three times a week for 8 weeks. Prior to study entry patients were evaluated for genomic aberration (FISH), IgV H mutation status, ZAP70 expression, and number of CD20 antigen sites. Changes in self-reported fatigue were measured using the FACT-An fatigue scale. Eighty-two patients have been enrolled at this time and 55 are evaluable for response and toxicity.

Grade 3 thromobocytopenia was observed in 2% of the patients and Grade 3\u20134 neutropenia in 4%. Grade 3 infections were observed in 9% of the patients.

In conclusion, the combination of rituximab plus GM-CSF is well tolerated and associated with an encouragingly high response rate. Favorable genomic profile, mutated IgV H status and high level of CD20 expression predicted for response to this combination. Ongoing correlative studies aim to clarify the mechanism of action of this combination. Accrual to this study is ongoing.",
