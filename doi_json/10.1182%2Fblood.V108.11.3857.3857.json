    "abstract_text": "Objective:To investigate the bone marrow function of stem cells in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and to explore the pathogenesis of cytopenia in patients with SLE. Methods:Sixteen patients with SLE and 10 healthy controls were studied for in vitro cultures of CFU-E, BFU-E and CFU-GM from bone marrow mononuclear cells. Results:49.43\u00b134.65 of CFU-E colonies per 10 5 BMMCs, 49.2\u00b139.61 of CFU-GM colonies per 10 5 BMMNCs and 3.01\u00b14.54 of BFU-E colonies per 10 5 BMMCs were seen in the group of SLE patients with normal blood count. 143.33\u00b1152.8 of CFU-E colonies per 10 5 BMMCs, 122.2\u00b1169.87 of CFU-GM colonies per 10 5 BMMCs, and 2.76\u00b13.28 of BFU-E colonies per 10 5 BMMCs were seen in the group of SLE with hemocytopenia. 66.3\u00b112.95 of CFU-E colonies per 10 5 BMMCs, 36.7\u00b111.95 of CFU-GM colonies per 10 5 BMMCs, and 36\u00b111.66 of BFU-E colonies per 10 5 BMMCs were seen in the group of normal controls.The quantity of BFU-E colonies per 10 5 BMMCs in SLE patients were significant lower than that in normal controls. There were no significant differences of the quantities of CFU-GM and CFU-E colonies between the SLE patients and normal controls. Conclusions: 1. There were no significant differences of CFU-GM and CFU-E colonies between the SLE patients and normal controls, that suggested that SLE patients have normal proliferate function of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells.2 There were significant lower BFU-E colonies per 10 5 BMMCs in SLE patients than that in normal controls.",
