    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1353 The transcription factors PU.1 and C/EBP\u03b1 are key regulators of hematopoietic cell differentiation. Tight and coordinated regulation of these factors is essential for normal hematopoiesis and even moderate alterations can lead to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Previous studies established that in PU.1 knockout mice myeloid differentiation is blocked at an earlier stage compared to C/EBP\u03b1 knockouts, consistent with PU.1 acting upstream of C/EBP\u03b1 during hematopoietic differentiation. Recently, however, we and others identified a PU.1 upstream regulatory element (URE) which contains potential C/EBP binding sites. C/EBP\u03b1 binds to the PU.1 URE in vitro and in vivo . Furthermore, C/EBP\u03b1 transactivated the PU.1 proximal promoter in a URE dependent manner. We, therefore, hypothesized that PU.1 is a target gene of C/EBP\u03b1 in hematopoietic cells. To assess the role of PU.1 as a downstream target of C/EBP\u03b1 in normal hematopoiesis we performed gene expression analysis in immature hematopoietic cells of conditional C/EBP\u03b1 knockout mice (Mx1-Cre). Of note, we observed a strong reduction of PU.1 expression in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs: CD150+CD48-LSK) after excision of C/EBP\u03b1, corroborating that PU.1 is a target of C/EBP\u03b1 in murine HSCs in vivo . Moreover, lentiviral PU.1 expression alleviated the myeloid differentiation block of C/EBP\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 KSL cells as evidenced by the differentiation to Gr-1 and Mac1 positive myeloid cells. Targeted deletion of the PU.1 URE reduces PU.1 expression and induces myeloid leukemia. Additionally, inactivation of C/EBP\u03b1 by various mechanisms is a common observation in many AML subtypes. Therefore, we tested if dysregulation of C/EBP\u03b1 is associated with decreased PU.1 expression. Gene expression studies in several human AML cell lines revealed a positive correlation between C/EBP\u03b1 and PU.1 expression. Furthermore, we analyzed expression of C/EBP\u03b1 and PU.1 in a well characterized cohort of 285 AML patients. Importantly, PU.1 expression was strongly reduced in cases with either C/EBP\u03b1 mutations or C/EBP\u03b1 promoter silencing compared to other AML subtypes. Taken together, our data support that PU.1 is a downstream target gene of C/EBP\u03b1 in normal hematopoiesis as well as human leukemia. We currently develop a mouse model containing targeted mutations of three C/EBP binding sites in the PU.1 URE. This model will help to further pinpoint the functional impact of C/EBP\u03b1 mediated regulation of PU.1 in different hematopoietic populations and to determine how this regulation may contribute to leukemia development in vivo.
