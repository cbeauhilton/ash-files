    "abstract_text": "Introduction Brentuximab vedotin (BV) targets CD30, a receptor expressed on the Reed-Sternberg cells of classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Nivolumab (Nivo) restores antitumor immunity by blocking the PD-1 receptor on activated T-cells. In this phase 1/2 study, combination treatment (tx) with BV + Nivo demonstrated durable efficacy in patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (R/R) cHL (Herrera, Blood 2018; NCT02572167). Biomarkers consistent with innate and adaptive immune activation were observed in the peripheral blood of pts treated with the combination regimen. Herein, we associate biomarkers in the peripheral blood with clinical response, and present follow-up results for pts who received BV + Nivo under staggered and concurrent dosing schedules. Methods Enrolled pts had cHL that relapsed or was refractory to frontline chemotherapy. In Parts 1 and 2 (staggered dosing), pts received up to 4 cycles of BV 1.8 mg/kg and Nivo 3.0 mg/kg given on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1, respectively, and together on Day 1 of Cycles 2-4. Pts in Part 3 (concurrent dosing) received the same dose of both agents on Day 1 of all 4 cycles. After investigators assessed response (Cheson 2014, with the incorporation of LYRIC [Cheson 2016] for pts in Part 3), pts could undergo ASCT. Results Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar across all treated pts (N=91) in the staggered and concurrent dosing cohorts; median age 34 years (yrs, range; 18-69), 42% with primary refractory disease, and 30% with relapse within 1 yr of frontline therapy. All 91 pts are off-tx and have been observed through the 100-day safety reporting period. A total of 86 pts (92%) completed all 4 cycles of BV + Nivo. Early tx discontinuations were due to; AE (peripheral neuropathy and increased GGT [1 pt each]), progressive disease (PD), investigator decision, and pt decision (1 pt each). Most common AEs prior to ASCT or additional salvage therapy were nausea (52%) and infusion-related reactions (IRRs, 43%). Excluding IRRs, 14% of pts had immune-related AEs requiring tx with systemic steroids, including rash (8%), pneumonitis (4%), and AST increased, diarrhea, and Guillain-Barre syndrome (1% each). The ORR for all-treated pts was 85%, with 67% complete response (CR). A total of 67 pts (74%) underwent ASCT after tx with BV + Nivo. There were 22 pts who received additional salvage therapy after BV + Nivo (7 PD, 6 partial response, 5 stable disease, and 4 CR at EOT), 17 of whom later underwent ASCT. At a median of 22.6 months (range; 1.2, 41.2) from the start of tx, the estimated 2-yr PFS rate in all treated pts was 78%, and for pts who underwent ASCT after tx with BV + Nivo was 91% (Figure 1). At 2 years, the estimated OS rate for all treated pts was 93%. Staggered and concurrent dosing of BV + Nivo resulted in increased levels of activated and dividing CD4+ T cells, activated and dividing CD8+ T cells (concurrent dosing-only), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and circulating plasmablasts in blood. We did not observe any associations between the magnitude of these changes and clinical response. Pts with CR exhibited trends for higher pre-tx blood levels of CD30+ Tregs and CD30+ Th subsets compared to pts without CR, suggesting BV depletion of these populations may have a role in the clinical mode of action of BV + Nivo. Although pre-tx levels of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) in blood did not differentiate pts with CR from other pts, pts in the lower quartile of pre-tx CTL levels showed significantly shorter PFS than other pts, suggesting a potential association between CTLs and disease control. Changes in blood cytokine and chemokine levels were observed after BV + Nivo, including increased levels of IL-18, IP-10, I-TAC, and sCD30, and decreased levels of TARC, IL-2Ra, and IL-6. Our analyses support strong correlations between pre-tx cytokine/chemokine levels and clinical benefit including trends linking lower pre-tx levels of IL-18, I-TAC, and IL-2RA to achieving CR and longer PFS. Conclusion BV + Nivo, both staggered and current dosing, showed tolerability and high CR rates with durable remissions among pts with R/R cHL. Analysis of blood biomarkers identified trends potentially linking baseline levels of CD30+ immune cells and the baseline pt inflammatory state with the activity of BV + Nivo. Together, these encouraging results support further investigation of BV + Nivo as initial salvage therapy in pts with R/R cHL.
