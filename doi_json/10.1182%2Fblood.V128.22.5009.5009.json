    "abstract_text": "Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) are at increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to general individuals. With the introduction of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), such as thalidomide and lenalidomide, substantially elevates the incidence of VTE. It was reported that patients with MM have significantly increased plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) level resulting in a decrease of fibrinolytic activity. To prevent VTE in MM patients receiving IMiDs, different prophylactic strategies such as low molecular weight heparin, aspirin and warfarin have been recommended. But most of those recommendations are based on limited evidence. Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) is one of the most widely used herbal supplements, which has been used in thrombosis prevention. It prompts us to investigate the impact of thalidomide on fibrinolysis and whether GBE has affection on fibrinolysis. In this study, the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured alone or co-cultured with human multiple myeloma cell line (MMCs) in the medium with or without thalidomide and in the presence or absence of GBE. After 48 hours, culture supernatants were collected and protein concentration of t-PA and PAI-1 were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results showed that MMCs and thalidomide can both altered the profibrinolytic potential of HUVECs by decreasing t-PA and increasing PAI-1 levels. When co-cultured with MMCs, thalidomide can further elevate PAI-1 levels but not further reduce t-PA. Whether HUVECs alone or co-cultured with MMCs, GBE was able to counteract these effects caused by thalidomide through increasing t-PA and decreasing PAI-1 levels. Results in this study indicate that GBE blunts the prothrombotic effect of thalidomide on HUVECs. It supports GBE clinic use for the prevention of VTE induced by IMiDs.
