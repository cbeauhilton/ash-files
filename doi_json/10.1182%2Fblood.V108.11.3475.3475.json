    "abstract_text": "The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was recently identified as a promising new therapeutic target in cancer treatment. An increased proteasome activity was described in certain cancer types, especially in multiple myeloma (MM) and also in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has been approved for the treatment of refractory MM and has also shown reproducible activity in MCL. Recently we described a novel tripeptide compound, BSc2118, with inhibitory activity against all three proteolytic activities (post-glutamyl peptide hydrolase-like, trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like activities) of the 20S proteasome ( Cancer Res  2006 ; 66 : 7598 \u2013605 ). We investigated the in vitro effects of BSc2118 in MM and MCL cell lines by MTT cell viability and AnnexinV apoptosis-assays. Furthermore, the intracellular chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity and NF-\u03baB activity were detected in MM and MCL cells by detection of proteasome-degraded peptides or NF-\u03baB p65 subunit. In MM cell lines OPM-2 and U266 we could show a significant time and dose-dependent reduction of cell viability by BSc2118 with an IC50 at 48hrs of 52nM and 65nM, respectively, whereas the MM cell line RPMI-S was less sensitive with an IC50 of 287nM. Using AnnexinV assay, a dose-dependent induction of apoptosis by BSc2118 was shown after 48hrs incubation. Comparably, in MCL we also found a time and dose-dependent reduction of cell viability in the cell lines HBL-2, JeKo-1 and Granta-519 with an IC50 of 82nM, 130nM and 262nM, respectively. Furthermore, BSc2118 induced apoptosis in all three MCL cell lines. Additionally, we detected a significant dose-dependent inhibition of intracellular chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity in MM and MCL cells, and a dose-dependent inhibition of TNF\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activation in the MM cell lines OPM-2 and RPMI-S. This is the first report of anti-tumor effects of the novel proteasome inhibitor BSc2118 in MM and MCL cells. The compound effectively reduces the cell survival and shows a high pro-apoptotic activity in the MM cell lines OPM-2 and U266 and a significant activity in MCL cell lines HBL-2 and JeKo-1. Mechanisms of action are the inhibition of proteasome and NF-\u03baB activity. Since previous clinical trials have shown an activity of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in MM and MCL, and adverse effects of other proteasome inhibitors may differ, our preclinical data support the idea to consider BSc2118 as a promising new agent in anti-tumor drug development."
