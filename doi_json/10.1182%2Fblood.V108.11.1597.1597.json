    "abstract_text": "The most serious form of \u03b1 thalassemia, Hb Barts hydrops fetalis, results in fetal death and dangerous obstetric complications. Syndromes containing two \u03b1 gene deletions on the same chromosome (in cis), e.g. \u03b1 thalassemia trait and Hb H disease, are carriers of this condition. The most common cis deletion is the Southeast Asian (-- SEA /) deletion. The gold standard diagnosis for carriers is DNA investigation, a technique only available in specialized laboratories. The current routine screening test, Hb H screen, is considered insensitive, observer dependant and time consuming. We present results of a prospective Ontario multicentre study investigating the effectiveness of a new \u03b6 globin ELISA and a standardized Hb H screen compared to DNA testing for the detection of Hb Barts hydrops fetalis carriers. Study testing included CBC, Hb variant detection, Hb A 2 and Hb F quantitation, a standardized Hb H inclusion body screen, ferritin level, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, gap PCR and \u03b6 globin ELISA. The standardized Hb H screen utilized commercially prepared brilliant cresyl blue incubated for one hour at 37\u00b0C followed by microscopic examination for Hb H, two minutes each of two blood films. The calculated sensitivities and specificities for the detection of various genotypes of \u03b1 thalassemia are noted in Table 1. Of 102 carriers 27 (26.5%) had a concomitant cause of microcytosis. Results show \u03b6 globin ELISA is highly sensitive and specific for SEA \u03b1 thalassemia trait but is less effective than Hb H screening in detecting SEA Hb H disease, and is of no value in the detection of non-SEA \u03b1 thalassemia trait and non-SEA Hb H disease. Neither test is of value in detecting single \u03b1 globin gene deletions. The standardized Hb H screen showed better than expected performance. With all carrier genotypes considered Hb H screen and \u03b6 globin ELISA displayed equal sensitivity and specificity. We conclude that a positive \u03b6 globin ELISA is diagnostic of the SEA deletion, that combined use of both a standardized Hb H screen and \u03b6 globin ELISA improves the sensitivity of Hb Barts hydrops fetalis carrier detection from 0.71 to 0.91 with no loss of specificity, combined testing should be standard practice for \u03b1 thalassemia testing in routine laboratories and that detection of an alternate cause of microcytosis does not exclude Hb Barts hydrops fetalis carriers and should not be used for this purpose.
