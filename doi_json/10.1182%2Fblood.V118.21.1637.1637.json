    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1637 Blinatumomab (MT103) is a single-chain bispecific antibody construct with specificity for CD19 and CD3 belonging to the class of bispecific T cell engager (BiTE\u00ae). A phase I trial with indolent and mantle cell lymphoma patients established a maximal tolerable dose (MTD) at 60 \u03bcg/m 2 /d. The trial was subsequently amended to evaluate blinatumomab in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Patients were treated by 4\u20138-week continuous i.v. administration with the following dosing regimen: first week at 5 \u03bcg/m 2 /d, second week at 15 \u03bcg/m 2 /d and for the remaining treatment period at 60 \u03bcg/m 2 /d. Two cohorts each with 6 DLBCL patients were enrolled. The two cohorts solely differed by the dose and schedule of corticosteroid medication administered at the beginning of blinatumomab infusion for mitigation of adverse events. In the first cohort 100 mg prednisolone was applied 1 hour prior to start; and in the second cohort patients received dexamethasone on days 1, 2, and 3. Three sequential patients received dexamethasone also 6\u201312 hours prior to start of infusion. Out of the twelve patients, 5 were male and 7 female. The median age was 57 years (range from 26 to 78 years). Patients had received a median of 4 prior regimens (range from 2\u20136). All patients had been exposed to rituximab. Eight of the 12 patients had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). International prognostic index (IPI) at screening ranged from 1 to 3 with a median of 2. The most common clinical adverse events (AEs) regardless of causality (>30%) were pyrexia (81.8%), fatigue (54.5%), constipation (36.4%), headache (36.4%), tremor (36.4%) and weight increase (36.4%). The most frequent laboratory AEs regardless of causality (>30%) were hyperglycemia (63.6%), lymphopenia (54.5%), C-reactive protein increase (45.5%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increase (45.5%) and thrombocytopenia (36.4%). Most AEs occurred early and were reversible. Four of 12 patients discontinued infusion due to fully reversible CNS events, 2 of which qualified as dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). Although just one DLT (reversible CNS event grade 3) occurred in the prednisolone cohort, a further cohort applying prophylactic dexamethasone was opened to optimize management of CNS events. A further refinement of the dexamethasone schedule, starting longer time prior to start of blinatumomab, was introduced after one early patient in the cohort receiving dexamethasone had experienced a reversible CNS event leading to discontinuation. All three patients treated in this manner completed the first blinatumomab cycle without discontinuations. Only one showed a grade 1 tremor, and no other CNS AEs were reported in these three patients. Two of 12 patients were not exposed to 60 \u03bcg/m 2 /d due to early discontinuations and 1 patient is too early in treatment for response evaluation. Five out of the remaining 9 evaluable patients (56%) showed objective clinical responses (4 CR/CRu; 1 PR). Three out of the 5 patients with CR/CRu or PR had prior ASCT. Two patients achieved objective responses (1 CR, 1 PR) despite of discontinuation at 60 \u03bcg/m 2 /d. The median response duration is +182 days (longest current duration +428 days), with 4 out of 5 responses still ongoing. Further evaluation of the last cohort will refine the recommended phase II dose, and the intensity and timing of dexamethasone comedication. The observation of lasting CRs after blinatumomab monotherapy in DLBCL patients is promising and warrants further exploration in a phase II study. Disclosures: Krause: Micromet: Research Funding.
