    "abstract_text": "Background: Management of anemia is a common therapeutic challenge in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Luspatercept (ACE-536), a fusion protein containing modified activin receptor type IIB, is being developed for treatment of anemia in lower-risk MDS. Luspatercept binds GDF11 and other TGF-\u03b2 superfamily ligands to promote late-stage erythroid differentiation and increase hemoglobin (Hgb) levels (Suragani R, Nat Med, 2014 and Attie K, Am J Hematol, 2014). Aims: This is an ongoing, phase 2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the effects of luspatercept in patient (pts) with low-intermediate risk MDS. Endpoints included erythroid response (IWG HI-E), RBC transfusion independence (RBC-TI, \u2265 8 weeks), duration of HI-E, pharmacodynamic and iron metabolism biomarkers, safety, and pt-reported QoL. Methods: Inclusion criteria included age \u2265 18 yr, Hgb < 10 g/dL (if < 4U RBC/8 weeks), no prior HMA, and no current lenalidomide or erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). An expansion cohort of up to 56 patients was added to this phase 2 study to evaluate response to luspatercept in pts who do not qualify for the phase 3 MEDALIST trial (for RS+ positive patients with baseline EPO \u2265 200 U/L and \u2265 2U RBC/8 weeks). These include pts with low transfusion burden (< 4U RBC/8 weeks) who are either 1) ring sideroblast (RS)+ (\u2265 15% RS in bone marrow) with baseline EPO \u2264 200 U/L and no prior ESA use, or 2) RS- with any baseline EPO level and any prior ESA use. Patients are treated with 1.0 mg/kg of luspatercept every 3 weeks for up to 5 doses, with titration up to 1.75 mg/kg. Patients may rollover to an open-label extension study for up to an additional 2 years of treatment. Results: Results for the initial patient cohorts have demonstrated a high proportion of HI-E and RBC-TI responses in RS+ patients. Data for the additional ESA-na\u00efve RS+ patients with low EPO levels and RS- patients with 3 months of treatment will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: Erythroid response to luspatercept has been demonstrated in RS+ patients with lower-risk MDS and is being explored in ESA-na\u00efve RS+ patients with low EPO levels and RS- patients. A Phase 3 study of luspatercept in regularly-transfused RS+ patients with lower-risk MDS according to IPSS-R is ongoing (MEDALIST study; NCT02631070).
