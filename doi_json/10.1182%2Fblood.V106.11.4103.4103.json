    "abstract_text": "Background: Acquired Hemophilia A (AH) due to factor VIII inhibitor is a rare life threatening disorder. If not diagnosed and treated urgently, significant mortality and morbidity results. AH can occur in setting of old age, autoimmune diseases, pregnancy, medication, malignancy, and lymphoproliferatve disorders. In majority of cases it is idiopathic. Objective: Review the treatment modalities and outcome of AH patients at our institution. Methods: A retrospective review of the data pertaining to patients who were diagnosed with AH at our institution between 1993\u20132004. Results: There were 5 patients diagnosed with AH, 3 female and 2 male. The median age was 67 years (range 30\u201384 years) the setting for development of AH in these patients was as follows: 1- postpartum, 1-HIV, 3 idiopathic. All patients presented with varying degree of spontaneous hemorrhage. The median Factor VIII inhibitor level was 16 Bethesda Unit (BU)(range 7. 2\u201331). Acute control of hemorrhage was achieved in all patients using either FEIBA (Factor eight inhibitor bypass activity) alone (1 patient), FEIBA and Novo seven (VIIa)(4 patients). Chronic immunosuppressive therapy was given as follows: Steroid alone (2 patients), Steroid and IVIG (1 patients), Steroid and Cyclophospamide (1 patient) and Steroid, Cyclophospamide and Rituximab (1 patient). Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 4 patients and with the final patient still receiving treatment. In one patient, the dose of Cyclophospamide was decreased due to Leucopenia. The median time to elimination of inhibitors was 5 month (range 1\u201310 month). There have been no mortalities. Conclusions: AH is a life threatening condition if not promptly diagnosed and treated, mortality remains significantly high. Treatment with factors replacement and immunosuppressive therapy was effective in all our patients",
