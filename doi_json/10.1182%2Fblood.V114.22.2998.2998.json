Numerous GPIIbIIIa antagonists have been designed and tested as inhibitors of platelet aggregation. Two of these antagonists, eptifibatide (Integrilin) and tirofiban (Aggrastat) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and widely used for preventing and treating thrombotic complications in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and in patients with acute coronary syndromes. It has been reported, however, that some GPIIbIIIa antagonists, such as orbofiban and xemilofiban, promote apoptosis in cardiomyocytes by activation of the apoptosis executioner caspase-3, raising the possibility that platelets also may be susceptible to pro-apoptotic effects of eptifibatide and tirofiban. Over the past decade it has been well-documented that apoptosis occurs not only in nucleated cells but also in anucleated platelets stimulated with thrombin, calcium ionophores, very high shear stresses and platelet storage (Leytin et al, J Thromb Haemost 4: 2656, 2006; Mason et al, Cell 128: 1173, 2007). It has been further reported that platelet activation and apoptosis may be induced by different mechanisms and/or require different levels of triggering stumuli (Leytin et al, Br J Haematol 136: 762, 2007; Br J Haematol 142: 494, 2008). Recently, we have shown that injection of anti-GPIIb antibody induced caspase-3 activation in mouse platelets in vivo (Leytin et al, Br J Haematol 133: 78, 2006), suggesting that direct GPIIbIIIa-mediated pro-apoptotic signaling is able to trigger caspase-3 activation within platelets. Study Design and Methods: The current study aimed to examine, for the first time, the effect of eptifibatide and tirofiban on caspase-3 activation in human platelets. We studied the effects of eptifibatide and tirofiban on caspase-3 activation in resting platelets, which express GPIIbIIIa receptors in their non-active (\u201cclosed\u201d) conformation, and in platelets stimulated with thrombin or calcium ionophore A23187, which induce transition of GPIIbIIIa receptors into active (\u201copen\u201d) conformation. Resting platelets were treated with control buffer, 0.48 \u03bcM eptifibatide or 0.48 \u03bcM tirofiban, and stimulated platelets were treated with 1 U/mL thrombin or 10 \u03bcM A23187, or preincubated with eptifibatide or tirofiban before treatment with thrombin or A23187. Caspase-3 activation was determined by flow cytometry using the cell-penetrating FAM-DEVD-FMK probe, which covalently binds to active caspase-3. Results and Discussion: We found that treatment of resting platelets with eptifibatide and tirofiban did not affect caspase-3 activation (P>0.05, n=7). In contrast, a 2.3-2.7-fold increase of caspase-3 activation was observed in platelets after thrombin or A23187 stimulation (P<0.01, n=7). However, when platelets were preincubated with eptifibatide and tirofiban before agonist treatment, these drugs significantly inhibited agonist-induced caspase-3 activation by an average of 44-50% (P<0.05, n=7). The fact that eptifibatide and tirofiban do not promote caspase-3 activation in unstimulated platelets suggests that these GPIIbIIIa antagonists do not induce transmission of pro-apoptotic transmembrane signals inside platelets through inactive GPIIbIIIa integrin. The inhibitory effect of eptifibatide and tirofiban on thrombin- and A23187-induced caspase-3 activation suggests a role of GPIIbIIIa integrin in caspase-3 activation induced by these platelet agonists. Conclusions: We have demonstrated a novel platelet-directed activity of two clinically used GPIIbIIIa antagonist drugs, eptifibatide (Integrilin) and tirofiban (Aggrastat), with ability to inhibit apoptosis executioner caspase-3 induced by potent platelet agonists, thrombin and A23187, and the absence of adverse pro-apoptotic effects on resting platelets. Taken together with earlier reported data (Leytin et al, Br J Haematol 133: 78, 2006), the current study indicates that, aside from their well-known participation in platelet activation and aggregation, GPIIbIIIa receptors are involved in the modulation of platelet apoptosis. This GPIIbIIIa-mediated mechanism of apoptosis modulation may be very efficient given the extremely large number of GPIIbIIIa copies (\u224880,000) on the platelet surface.
