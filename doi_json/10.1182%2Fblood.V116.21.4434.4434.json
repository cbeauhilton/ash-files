Methods 20 newly diagnosed IRP patients, 10 AA patients, 10 MDS patients and 10 healthy donors as controls were enrolled in this study.The level of autoantibody-IgG in bone marrow was measured by Western blot; The autoantigens targeted by autoantibody IgG in IRP were identified from membrane protein extracts by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Results The level of autoantibody IgG in bone marrow of untreated IRP patients was 75% (15/20), which was significantly higher than that of AA or MDS patients (0%) and normal controls(10%)(P<0.01). Autoantibody IgG in IRP could react with several autoantigens with approximate MWs of 25\u201330kDa, 60\u201365 kDa, 73 kDa and 83 kDa. Positive rates of individual autoantigens were 35%,50%,20% and 10%,respectively. Conclusion Autoantibody IgG reacted with membrane antigens could be found in bone marrow in IRP patients. The molecular weights of the autoantigens were mainly 25\u201330kDa, 60\u201365 kDa, 73 kDa and 83 kDa. The result showed that autoantibody IgG played an important role in IRP.
