    "abstract_text": "Several studies have demonstrated potential prognostic importance of angiogenesis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Elevated expression of angiogenic activator angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) was recently reported in CLL but data regarding prognostic significance of Ang-2 in CLL is limited. Therefore, we evaluated potential relationship between Ang-2 expression and other prognostic factors in patients with CLL. Ang-2 mRNA was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR in purified mononuclear cells of 33 untreated CLL patients. Ang-2 transcript levels were further analyzed with regard to clinical stage, disease course, IgVH mutation status, CD38 and ZAP-70 expression. Elevated Ang-2 mRNA was detected in 12 cases; twenty-one patients had very low or undetectable levels of Ang-2 transcript. High Ang-2 mRNA levels were significantly associated with unmutated IgVH genes (p=0.010) and high CD38 expression (p=0.011) but not with ZAP-70 expression (p=0.784), Rai stage (p=0.305) or stable vs. progressive clinical course (p=0.443). Interestingly, there was a trend towards shorter progression-free survival in patients with high Ang-2 expression, but it did not reach statistical significance (median 15 months vs. not reached; p=0.090). In conclusion, our data show that Ang-2 mRNA is differentially expressed in patients with CLL and its increased expression appears to be associated with poor prognostic features."
