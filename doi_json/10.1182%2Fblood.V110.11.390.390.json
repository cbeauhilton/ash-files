    "abstract_text": "Purpose: This trial aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of sequential treatment with rituximab and CHOP-21 in patients with PTLD unresponsive to reduction of immunosuppression. Methods: An ongoing prospective multicenter phase II trial was initiated in January 2003. Patients were treated sequentially with rituximab at days 1, 8, 15 and 22 followed by four cycles of CHOP-21 combined with G-CSF support starting 4 weeks after the last dose of rituximab. Results: In this 3 rd interim analysis after enrolment of 75 patients 64 patients have finished the protocol. The median follow up is 19.6 months. 58 patients were diagnosed with monomorphic PTLD, 6 with polymorphic PTLD. 23 patients were kidney, 15 liver, 12 heart, 3 lung, 2 heart+lung, 3 kidney+pancreas, 1 bone marrow transplant recipients (5 others). Median age was 53 years (range 16 to 74). 59% had stage III or IV disease. 48% of tumors were EBV positive. 79% of patients had late PTLD (i.e. later than 1 year after transplantation). LDH was elevated in 67% of patients. The overall response rate of sequential therapy was 90% (CR 65%, PR 25%). Progression free survival (PFS) and disease free survival (DFS) were 71.4% and 81.2% at two years, respectively. Treatment response to rituximab (CR/PR versus SD/PD) was a significant factor predicting overall survival (OS) with OS rates of 91.3% and 56.5% at 1 year, respectively (p=0.0107). Following chemotherapy, WHO \u00b03/4 leukopenia was observed in 38% of cycles and 16% of patients suffered from WHO \u00b03/4 infections. There were four early therapy-associated deaths due to infections (7%). Fatal bleeding complications occurred in 3% and 5% of patients died from primary refractory disease. Conclusions: This is one of the largest prospective studies in PTLD. Sequential treatment with rituximab and CHOP-21 + G-CSF is well tolerated and highly effective. Treatment response to rituximab is predictive for overall survival. As compared to rituximab monotherapy more patients achieve a CR with sequential therapy and PFS is very much prolonged.
