    "abstract_text": "Background: Recent data indicate that driver mutations are prognostically informative in patients (pts) with primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Patients with CALR type 1/like (Ty1) mutation had better survival (OS) compared with pts with CALR type 2/like (Ty2) and JAK2 V617F/ MPL W515 mutation (Tefferi A, Blood 2014; Guglielmelli P, BCJ. 2015); conversely, pts lacking any driver mutation, i.e. \"triple negative\"(TN), suffered from the worst survival (Rumi E, Blood 2014; Guglielmelli P, Blood 2017). Furthermore, a high molecular risk category (HMR), pointing to pts harboring at least one of ASXL1, EZH2, IDH1/2 and SRSF2 mutated genes, independently predicted for shortened survival and increased risk of leukemia (Vannucchi A, Leukemia 2013; Guglielmelli P, Leukemia 2014). Aims: To comparatively evaluate the molecular landscape of TN patients in comparison with other driver mutation categories and the possible relationships with the adverse outcome of this pts' group. Methods: The patient cohort included 680 PMF patients, diagnosed according to WHO-2016 criteria, who provided informed consent for the study. Pts were referred by 6 Italian Centers belonging to the AGIMM group. For all patients driver ( JAK2, MPL , CALR) and HMR mutation status was obtained by PCR and NGS, respectively. For 201 of these patients (38 Ty1, 20 Ty2, 110 JAK2/MPL and 32 TN), extended NGS sequencing was performed using Ion Torrent platform in Florence (n=133) and a hybrid-capture NGS-CGP assay [FoundationOne heme\u00ae assay (He J et al, Blood, 2016)] in Cambridge (n=68). NGS covered a panel of 20 non-driver genes including: all coding sequence of c-KIT, TET2, RUNX1, NRAS, KRAS, DNAMT3A, IKZF1, EZH2, TP53 ; hot spot of IDH1/2 and SRSF2 and selected exons of CBL, IDH2, ASXL1, SF3B1, NFE2, SH2B3, U2AF1 and SETBP1 . The nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival and log-rank test were used as appropriate. Results: Of the 680 pts included, 419 were JAK2 +(70%), 38 MPL + (5.6%), 82 TN (12.1%) and 140 CALR + (22%; 105 (75%) Ty1 and 35 (25%) Ty2). Overall, 81 pts (11.9%) progressed to AML. Death occurred in 325 pts (47.8%) after a median follow up of 4.8y. Median survival of CALR Ty1 was 17.8y vs 8.6y for CALR Ty2, 7.2y for JAK2/MPL and 2.6y for TN (P<.0001). The corresponding hazard ratio, taking CALR Ty1 as reference, was 1.6 (95%CI,1.0-2.9), 2.2 (95%CI, 1.5-3.1) and 4.9 (95%CI, 3.2-7.5) for CALR Ty2, JAK2/MPL and TN pts, respectively. HMR status was associated with shortened survival (HR 2.4, 95%CI 1.9-3.0; P2 HMR mutations (HR 4.1, 95%CI 3.0-5.6; P<.001). Among the mutated genes of the extended panel, those associated with shortened OS, in addition to the 5 HMR genes, were NRAS (P=.002), TP53 (P=.049), U2AF1 (P=.035) and SETBP1 (<.001). Negative impact on survival was maintained irrespective of underlying driver mutation. TN pts showed enrichment of SRSF2 mutations (28% vs 1% in CALR Ty1, 6% CALR Ty2, 9% JAK2/MPL ; P<.0001) and ASXL1 (37% vs 23% in CALR Ty1, 29% CALR Ty2, 25% JAK2/MPL ; P=0.02). As many as 56% of TN pts were in the HMR category compared with27% in CALR Ty1, 37% CALR Ty2, 36% JAK2/MPL (P=0.02) and >2 HMR mutations were found in 27% of TN pts vs 4% Ty1, 9% Ty2, 9% JAK2/MPL (P<.001). Regarding the additional prognostically meaningful mutations of the extended panel, 69% of TN pts had at least 1 mutated gene compared with 38% Ty1, 39% Ty2, 48% JAK2/MPL (P<.01); furthermore, 2 and more mutated genes were found in 53% of TN pts vs 13% in Ty1, 17% in Ty2, 27% in JAK2/MPL ( P=.01). In particular, NRAS mutations were found in 18% of TN pts vs 8% Ty1, 10% Ty2, 2% JAK2/MPL (P=.006). The median OS was significantly reduced in TN pts having at least one of the additional mutations: 1.9y (range 1.8-2.1y) compared with pts lacking those mutations (OS not reached; HR 5.3; 95%CI, 1.5-18.8). The median age of TN pts (67y, 13-91y) was no different from JAK2/MPL (65y; 19-90) and Ty2 (60y, 18-88y), while Ty1 were significantly younger (48y, 16-96); therefore, accumulation of mutations among TN pts in comparison with other driver mutation categories could not be explained by advanced age, except for CALR Ty1. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the worse outcome associated with Triple Negativity in PMF might be explained, at least in part, by an underlying greater mutation complexity.
