    "abstract_text": "Cancer generates a state of immune suppression that contributes to tumor out-growth and the escape phase of the immune editing of nascent tumors. One hallmark of tumor mediated immune suppression is a decreased number of dendritic cells (DC) and an accumulation of immature myeloid cells (myeloid derived suppressor cells, MDSC) that are themselves directly immunosuppressive. Impairment of DC differentiation is mediated by numerous tumor derived factors (VEGF, GM-CSF, IL-6, and M-CSF) that activate Stat3. The mechanism by which Stat3 signaling subsequently inhibits DC differentiation has not been defined. Previous work in our lab has identified protein kinase C \u03b2II (PKC \u03b2II) as being essential in myeloid progenitor a\u0300 DC differentiation and that knock down of PKC \u03b2II expression blocks DC differentiation. This leads us to hypothesize that tumor derived factor activation of Stat3 may inhibit DC differentiation by down regulating PKC \u03b2II expression. To test our hypothesis, we utilized the hematopoietic progenitor-like cell line KG1. In response to the phorbol ester PMA, KG1 differentiates into a DC-like cell (KG1-DC). KG1 cultured in media conditioned by a human (MCF-7) or murine (DA3) mammary cancer cell line had a 48% (DA3) and 51% (MCF-7) reduction in PKC \u03b2II protein levels. Additionally, tumor conditioned media treatment significantly decreased PKC \u03b2II mRNA transcript levels (38-fold reduction compared to untreated, p10-fold) in clones stably expressing the constitutive active Stat3 construct (p<0.1). Clones expressing the dominant negative or wild type Stat3 constructs have PKC \u03b2II mRNA transcript levels comparable to or greater than the parental cell line (no difference to 2.5 fold increase). Similarly, PKC \u03b2II protein levels in clones stably expressing the constitutive active construct were reduced 75\u201395% compared to the parental cell line, while PKC \u03b2II protein levels in clones expressing the dominant negative construct were increased by 57\u2013110%. We have found that culture of a myeloid progenitor cell line in tumor conditioned media significantly decreases PKC \u03b2II mRNA transcript levels and protein levels, suggesting that tumor conditioned media decreases PKC \u03b2II gene expression. Decreased PKC \u03b2II expression was accompanied by impairment in DC differentiation, as measured by a significant decrease in the ability of KG1-DC to stimulate allogeneic T cell proliferation. Expression of a constitutive active Stat3 construct significantly decreased PKC \u03b2II transcript levels in K562, a DC progenitor-like cell line. Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that tumor derived factors inhibit DC differentiation by down regulation of PKC \u03b2II expression via Stat3 hyperactivation.",
