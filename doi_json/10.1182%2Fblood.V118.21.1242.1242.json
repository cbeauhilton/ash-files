    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1242 Background: While bivariate interactions between Factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20201A and hereditary deficiency of antithrombin, protein C and protein S compound VTE risk, whether other gene-gene interactions are associated with VTE is largely unknown. Objective: To test novel gene-gene interactions for an association with VTE. Methods: Genome-wide scan (Illumina 660Q [557,112 SNPs]) and candidate gene (12,551 SNPs in 764 genes within the anticoagulant, procoagulant, fibrinolytic and innate immunity pathways) genotypes from 1270 non-Hispanic adults of European ancestry with objectively-diagnosed VTE (cases; no cancer, venous catheter or antiphospholipid antibodies) and 1302 controls (frequency-matched on case age, gender, race, MI/stroke status) were merged and imputed to about 2.5 million SNPs with MACH using HapMap Phase 2 (60 CEU). We tested all pairwise SNP-SNP interactions using a 2-stage procedure (fast epistasis in the first stage and age, gender, MI/stroke status and state of residence adjusted analysis using logistic regression in the second stage). Results: The mean \u00b1 standard deviation case and control ages were 54.4 \u00b1 16.2 and 55.6 \u00b1 15.8 years, respectively and 51% were female. Among 2.299\u00d710^12 pairwise interactions tested, 900 million reached a p-value<E-06 and were be tested in the second stage. Of these, 2417, 278 and 22 SNP-SNP interactions reached p-values \u22641E-9, 1E\u201310, and1E-11 respectively; 121 SNP-SNP interactions reached the Bonferroni statistical significance threshold (\u22645.555659E-11). The gene-gene pairwise interactions with p-values\u22641E-11 were: (1) chromosome 3 open reading frame 70 ( C3orf70 ) \u2013 short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR family) member 4 ( DHRS4 ), (2) 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 4 ( AGPAT4 ) - NIMA (never in mitosis gene a)-related kinase 6 ( NEK6 ), and (3) TatD DNase domain containing 2 ( TATDN2 ) \u2013 WAS protein family, member 3 ( WASF3 ). No gene function data are available for C3orf70. DHRS4 encodes for a 3-ketosteroid reductase important for active steroid hormone regulation, AGPAT4 is important for signal transduction and lipid biosynthesis, NEK6 encodes for Nek6 which downregulates p53-induced cancer cell senescence, TATDN2 encodes a deoxyribonuclease, WASF3 encodes for a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family which are key regulators of signal transduction and cytoskeletal reorganization in hematopoietic cells. Conclusion: Pairwise gene-gene interaction analyses suggest potential associations between VTE and novel genes for future testing in replication studies.
