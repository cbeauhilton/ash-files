    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy derived from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). Today, no therapeutic consensus exists and only allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation provides a durable remission. BPDCN cells express high levels of the IL-3 receptor alpha chain (CD123) and exhibit an increased survival and growth in response to IL-3 (Chaperot et al. 2001). Recently, aberrant NF-\u03baB activation has been reported in BPDCN (Sapienza et al. 2014), and we identified that liver X receptor (LXR) stimulation inhibits NF-\u03baB activation in non-leukemic pDC. LXR represent nuclear receptors promoting cholesterol efflux via the ATP binding cassette A1 and G1 (ABCA1 and ABCG1, respectively) transporters and lipid acceptors, such as apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1). This process has been shown to repress IL-3-induced proliferation of murine hematopoietic stem cells (Yvan-Charvet et al. 2010). The aim of this study was to investigate LXR activation in BPDCN, and determine whether LXR agonists possess therapeutic effects. Material and Methods: Cells from 13 BPDCN, 22 undifferentiated AML, 23 ALL patients and 4 normal pDC were evaluated for expression of LXR or cholesterol exchange related genes ( lxra , lxrb , abca1 , abcg1 , apoe , srebp1c , ldlr , vldlr ), plus nfkb1 gene by Affymetrix mRNA microarray. BPDCN cells (2 established cell lines [GEN2.2, CAL-1], a primary cell line [BES1] and 5 fresh BPDCN samples) were treated with two LXR agonists (T0901317 [T09] or GW3965 [GW] at 1 \u00b5M, 10 \u00b5M or 50 \u00b5M), NF-\u03baB inhibitors (JSH 23, or Bortezomib [Bort]) and the cholesterol acceptor ApoA1 (10 \u00b5g/mL). Gene expression ( abca1, abcg1, nfkb1 , bcl2 , bax and bak1) was assessed by qRT-PCR. Cell death was assessed by Annexin V/7AAD staining (flow cytometry) and caspase activation (Western blot). CAL-1 cell proliferation was assessed by dye dilution (cytometry). Cholesterol efflux was measured directly by H 3 cholesterol efflux from cells and indirectly by membrane ABCA1 expression (confocal microscopy). NF-\u03baB and IL-3 signaling pathway activation was explored by protein phosphorylation (phospho-RelA and phospho-STAT5, respectively; [confocal microscopy and Western blot]). A BPDCN xenograft model was used to evaluate LXR agonist effect in-vivo with blast cell infiltration attested by human CD45/CD123/BDCA4 staining (cytometry). Results: BPDCN cells showed a unique transcriptomic signature with LXR-related gene downregulation. LXR agonist treatment for 24h restored LXR target gene expression, including abca1 and abcg1 , and induced a significant concentration-dependent killing (Fig. 1). Moreover, caspase 8 and 9 cleavage associated with bcl2 downregulation and bax and bak1 upregulation (0.78, 8 and 12.2 fold mRNA levels, respectively, for GW 50 \u00b5M, 6h, n=3) were observed. At a lower non cytotoxic concentration (10 \u00b5M), GW treatment inhibited cell proliferation (-25%, p<0.05, n=7) that was reinforced by addition of ApoA1 (-35%, n=2). This suggests a link with cholesterol efflux supported by induction of ABCA1 expression at BPDCN membrane and increase of H 3 cholesterol efflux in response to LXR agonists. LXR agonists inhibited IL-3-induced STAT5 phosphorylation and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway at transcriptional ( nfkb1 , 0.25 fold mRNA level, p<0.05, n=3 fresh BPDCN samples) and RelA phosphorylation levels. This suggests additional mechanisms by which LXR activation affects BPDCN. NF-kB inhibitor treatment (JSH23, 25 \u00b5M, 24h) reduced BPDCN survival (-35%, n=3) and proliferation (-20%, p<0.05, n=3). A synergic effect of NF-\u03baB inhibitors (JSH23 25 \u00b5M or Bort 30 nM) and LXR agonists (GW or T09, 10 \u00b5M), was observed on cell death and inhibition of proliferation (Fig. 1). The in-vivo study revealed a reduced CAL-1 infiltration in the spleen and bone marrow of T09-treated mice (1.2 mg/2 days for 14 days) compared with control mice (62% vs. 33% and 17% vs . 9%, respectively). Effects of LXR plus NF-\u03baB inhibitor treatment in vivo are under investigation. Conclusion: BPDCN exhibit a specific transcriptomic signature with LXR-related gene downregulation. LXR stimulation of BPDCN restores LXR-related gene expression and inhibits survival and proliferation. This may occur via several mechanisms: inhibition of IL-3 and NF-\u03baB signaling, and/or increased cholesterol efflux. A cytotoxic or cytostatic effect was confirmed in-vivo by reduced BPDCN infiltration. View large Download slide View large Download slide  Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
