    "abstract_text": "Background: Preclinically blocking PD-1/PD-L1 pathways enhanced anti-leukemic responses. PD-1 positive CD8 T-cells are increased in the bone marrow (BM) of patients (pts) with relapsed AML (Williams P et al., Cancer 2018). PD1 inhibition alone however had limited clinical activity in AML (Berger et al, Clin Cancer Res 2008). AZA up-regulates PD-1 and PD-L1 in AML and the up-regulation of these genes has been associated with emergence of resistance to AZA (Yang et al., Leukemia 2013). Methods: Pts were eligible for the AZA+Nivo (cohort 1) if they had relapsed/refractory AML (R/R AML), ECOG \u2264 2, and adequate organ function. 70 R/R AML pts were treated. This cohort is closed. A subsequent cohort of AZA+Nivo+Ipi was opened (cohort 2), with the same eligibility criteria. Ipi 1mg/kg Q6 weeks was added to the established AZA+Nivo schedule. This double CPI dosing was based on lung and melanoma dosing. Results: Cohort 1 of 70 R/R AML pts treated with Aza+Nivo (Daver et al., Cancer Discovery 2018). Response rates and OS were superior to contemporary historic HMA-based clinical trial controls at MDACC (Table 1), with most significant OS improvement in patients with low pretherapy BM blasts (10 with a statistically significant OS difference for PSI< vs > 10 (p= 0.0018) (Figure1B), suggesting this may be a more specific biomarker to prospectively select pts for T-cell therapy based trials. RNAseq and nanostring analysis on baseline R vs NR sample will be presented at the meeting. Cohort 2 of 31 R/R AML pts treated with Aza+Nivo+Ipi with median (med) age 71 years (26-86), secondary AML (49%), ELN unfavorable cytogenetics (65%), TP53 (38%), med salvage 2 (range, 1-4). 54% pts previously treated with HMA based therapies. 4 pts had prior alloSCT (med time from alloSCT 13 monts). 24 pts are evaluable, 7 too early. CR/CRi was noted in 9 (36%), additionally 2 (8%) had HI maintained >6 months, 4 (16%) stable disease (SD) (defined as absence of CR, CRi, PR, MLFS; with stable disease on treatment for at least 6 months), and 10 (40%) were NRs. The 4-week and 8-week mortality were 0 and 8%, respectively. In all salvage setting the med OS in Aza+Ipi+Nivo versus Aza+Nivo versus contemporary historical HMA-based clinical trial in R/R AML at MDACC, were 10.5, 6.4, and 4.6 months, respectively (P =0.0025) (Figure 1C). This median OS with Aza+Ipi+Nivo compares favorably even to DAC10+venetoclax in R/R AML (med OS: 7.1 months) reported from our center at ASH 2019. The 1-year OS in R/R AML pts with AZA+Nivo+Ipi was very encouraging at 45%. Grade 3/4 immune mediated toxicities were observed in 6 pts (25%), including rash, pneumonitis, and colitis. One pt required ICU stay but no deaths were attributed to immune toxicity. Other grade >2 toxicities were as expected for R/R AML population and were mostly infections/febrile neutropenia, and electrolyte disturbance. Conclusion: The CR/CRi rates and OS with Aza+Nivo+Ipi are encouraging, with median OS of >10 months in R/R high-risk AML, and the study is enrolling. PSI on pretherapy BM CD4 T-cells from pts treated with Aza+Nivo almost completely segregated Rs vs NRs (p=0.0317). This suggests a very significant and hitherto underappreciated immune diversity in AML and a critical need for biomarker based trials (as we are doing with molecular therapies) with immunotherapies in AML.
