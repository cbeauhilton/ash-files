    "abstract_text": "Abstract 377 Hemophilia B represents a promising model for the development of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors-based gene therapeutics. In the first clinical trial for AAV serotype 2 mediated gene transfer of Factor IX (F.IX) to the liver of severe hemophilia B subjects, transgene expression was short-lived with a gradual decline of F.IX levels. The loss of transgene expression was accompanied by a transient transaminitis, which we hypothesized to be the result of the reactivation of a pool of capsid-specific memory CD8+ T cells originated from a previous exposure to wild-type AAV. These results were unanticipated since previous work in small and large animal models showed that AAV administration is uneventful, allowing prolonged expression of F.IX transgene at therapeutic levels. We developed an in vitro cytotoxicity assay using a human hepatocyte cell line expressing HLA-B*0702, a common MHC class I allele for which the AAV capsid immunodominant epitope VPQYGYLTL was identified. Using this model, we demonstrated that HLA-matched AAV-specific effector CD8+ T cells were able to lyse target hepatocytes transduced with AAV-2. We now use this in vitro model of CTL killing of AAV-transduced hepatocytes to demonstrate the efficacy of a novel strategy to circumvent undesirable immune response through the engagement of regulatory T cells. A recently characterized MHC Class II-restricted T cell epitope (Tregitope) in the Fc fragment of IgG has been shown to induce regulatory T cells in vitro and in vivo (Blood, 2008; 112: 3303-3311). AAV-specific HLA-B*0702 effector cells expanded in the presence of a human Tregitope peptide resulted in 79% to 89% inhibition of cytotoxic activity against peptide-pulsed and AAV-transduced target cells, respectively. These results were confirmed using PBMCs from 5 different donors. A similar degree of inhibition of CTL activity was observed for the HLA allele A*0101, which binds to the AAV-derived epitope SADNNNSEY; co-culture of effector cells with the Tregitope inhibited CTL-mediated killing by 60%. Interestingly, the same Tregitope efficiently mediated suppression of CTL activity in subjects carrying different HLA alleles, indicating a high level of promiscuity of Tregitope binding. Staining for the regulatory T cell markers CD4, CD25, and FoxP3 supported the hypothesis that Tregitopes suppress T cell responses by expanding regulatory T cells; 62.2% of the CD4+ population stained positive for CD25 and FoxP3 in PBMCs expanded against AAV epitopes in the presence of Tregitope, compared with PBMCs expanded against an AAV epitope alone (3.63%), or against an AAV epitope and an irrelevant control peptide (1.94%). Polyfunctional analysis for markers for T cell activation showed that CD8+ T cells incubated in the presence of Tregitope had an approximately 5-fold decrease in production of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3and a 2-fold reduction in TNF-\u03b1 production, indicating levels of activation close to nai\u0308ve CD8+ T cells. We further characterized the mechanism of action of Tregitopes by showing that Tregitopes are required at the time of CD8+ T cell priming, as CTL activity of AAV-expanded CD8+ T cells against transduced hepatocytes was not inhibited by the CD4+ T cell fraction of PBMC expanded separately in vitro with Tregitopes only. We conclude that the use of Tregitopes represents a promising strategy for antigen-specific, Treg-mediated modulation of capsid-specific T cell responses. Disclosures: Martin: EpiVax: Employment.
