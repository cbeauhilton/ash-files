    "abstract_text": "Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) regulate cell growth and other key functions. Constitutive PTK activation by somatic mutations, overexpression, or abnormal upstream signaling is characteristic of many cancers, including hematologic malignancies, providing a rationale for therapeutically targeting PTKs with small molecules. Imatinib, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of BCR-ABL1, the PTK causal to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), established a paradigm for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as cancer therapeutics. Although a relatively weak inhibitor, imatinib is effective in most patients with chronic phase CML (CML-CP), while responses are transient in blastic phase (CML-BP). Point mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain have emerged as a major mechanism of drug resistance. The more potent second-generation TKIs \u2013 dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib \u2013 induce deeper and faster responses and are active against many imatinib-resistant mutants, with the exception of T315I in the gatekeeper position of the catalytic site. This problem was addressed with ponatinib, a third-generation TKI covering all single BCR-ABL1 mutants, including T315I. Ponatinib has excellent clinical activity in CML-CP patients who failed other TKIs, while responses in CML-BP are short-lived. Some patients fail ponatinib due to BCR-ABL1 compound mutations, suggesting even third-generation TKIs cannot completely prevent mutational escape by the disease-initiating kinase. Another unsolved problem is that TKIs fail to efficiently target CML stem cells, leading to recurrence of active leukemia upon discontinuation. Despite these shortcomings, TKIs have completely changed the face of CML. Unfortunately, repeating this success in other hematologic malignancies has been challenging, likely reflecting differences in disease biology as much as suboptimal design of early compounds. CML-CP represents one extreme of the spectrum, where a single genetic lesion is sufficient to produce the phenotype and the hierarchy of hematopoietic differentiation is maintained. The situation is different in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with activating FLT3 mutations. Not only these AML cases have mutations in other genes, they typically acquire FLT3 mutations late during disease evolution, implying that the disease-initiating clone will be impervious to FLT3 inhibition. Progress has been made through successive development of more potent TKIs with improved pharmacology, leading to quizartinib. It is clear, however, that FLT3 inhibitors cannot be used as single agents if there is a curative intent and the same may be true for JAK2 inhibitors in myelofibrosis. The first approved JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib, dramatically improves symptoms, but has yet to demonstrate a significant impact on the malignant clone and is certainly not curative. It remains to be seen whether this reflects the fact that JAK2 activation is not the disease\u2013initiating event, lack of inhibitor specificity towards the mutant JAK2 kinase, or other undesirable off-target effects that may be overcome with improved drugs. A completely new chapter was opened with ibrutinib, an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK), for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). BTK is essential for signal transduction from the B-cell receptor (BCR). No activating mutations in BTK have been identified in lymphoma or CLL, but constitutive BCR signaling is critical to CLL cell survival in the microenvironment. Early studies show excellent clinical activity in patients with advanced CLL, although many responses are incomplete; much like the imatinib responses in late CML-CP. Ibrutinib may have a similarly profound effect upon CLL as imatinib on CML, but perhaps also similar limitations, such as the inability to eradicate residual leukemia; this of course needs to be tested in frontline studies. TKIs have had a significant albeit uneven impact upon treatment paradigms in hematologic malignancies. Future progress will involve optimizing compounds in terms of potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetics. Allosteric inhibitors may add to the armamentarium. From the target perspective, it is likely that most activated kinase alleles have been discovered and the focus should shift to identification of disease-critical unmutated kinases. Lastly, identifying synthetically lethal inhibitor combinations will be critical to fully exploit the potential of TKI therapy.
