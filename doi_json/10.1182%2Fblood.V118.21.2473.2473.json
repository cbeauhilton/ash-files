    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2473 The Groucho/TLE family of corepressors has been described as master regulatory genes during development, affecting multiple cell fate decisions. These proteins bind to a variety of transcription factors and recruit inhibitory proteins to repress transcription. We previously identified TLE1 as a novel tumor suppressor gene that is deleted or methylated in subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other hematological malignancies. We find the loss of Tle1 alone is insufficient to induce leukemia in mice and apparently requires cooperation with additional oncogenes. Our studies, and those from other groups, have shown that over-expression of TLE1 in leukemia cells slows cell cycle progression, colony formation and tumor growth in xenografts, while silencing results in increased cell proliferation. The pathways by which TLE1 affects oncogenesis is unclear, but this gene family is capable of interacting with effectors of Myc, Wnt, Notch, TGFB signaling\u2013prominent pathways dysregulated in malignancies. Myc is important for hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, survival and differentiation and is over-expressed in most AML samples. The TLE homologue Groucho binds and represses Drosophila Myc expression of target genes, thus we postulated that TLE1 could be an important regulator of Myc activity in leukemia. Using hematopoietic progenitor cells from Tle1 knockout and wild-type fetal livers we found that the loss of Tle1 dramatically increased proliferation and serial replating efficiency. Expression of N-Myc by itself in wild type fetal liver cells triggered significant cell death and apoptosis. However, when N-Myc expression was combined with the additional loss of Tle1, not only was N-Myc induced apoptosis inhibited, but a dramatic cell proliferation, well in excess of that seen with Tle1 loss by itself, was seen. Furthermore, mice transplanted with N-Myc transduced hematopoietic cells from Tle1 knockout mice fetal liver developed a more aggressive leukemia, compared to N-Myc transfected wild type mice fetal liver hematopoietic cells, with increased proliferation of leukemic cells as demonstrated by in vitro colony assays and higher secondary transplantability. We extended these studies to a zebrafish model of Rag2-Myc mediated T-ALL. Using these zebrafish we demonstrated over-expression of the TLE homologue, Groucho , completely blocked the initiation and progression of Myc induced leukemia development. Expression of a truncated version of Groucho reduced the initiation of T-ALL and prolonged the survival of fish developing leukemia. These studies demonstrate TLE1 can inhibit the oncogenicity of Myc, and suggests modulation of expression of this gene family may be of importance for a variety of malignancies.
