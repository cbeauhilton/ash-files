    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2517 Poster Board II-494 Osteoclasts are bone resorbing cells located in the bone marrow that play a key role in hematopoiesis and formation of the hematopoietic niche. Previous studies demonstrate osteoclasts arise from the monocyte-macrophage lineage of cells within the bone marrow microenvironment. Osteoclast progenitor cells typically express the monocyte marker CD14, though relatively little is known about the developmental history of these osteoclastogeneic cells in humans. Osteoclast progenitors have been previously isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow. Previous studies by our group and others demonstrate human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can differentiate into CD34 + CD45 + cells that can be supported to differentiate into many types of hematopoietic cells, though development of osteoclasts have not been previously demonstrated. To better evaluate osteoclastogenesis, hESCs were allowed to differentiate on M210 stromal cells for 19\u201321 days then sorted for CD34 + CD45 + cells. These cells were placed into a secondary co-culture with M210 stromal cells using osteoclast differentiation factors macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hM-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor\u2013kB ligand (hRANKL) for 14\u201321 days. During this time, mononuclear hematopoietic cells expanded on top of the stromal cells, followed by appearance of multinucleated cells that became adherent and embedded within the stromal cell layer. These adherent multi-nucleated cells were TRAP-positive, consistent with osteoclasts. Q-RT-PCR analysis demonstrated expression of osteoclast genes NFATC1, TRAP, CATHEPSIN K AND MMP-9 . Culturing these putative osteoclasts on dentin discs demonstrated dentin resorption and pit formation, consistent with osteoclasts cultured from peripheral blood. No pit formation observed when the same experiments were done without hRANKL and hMCSF. Most remarkable was the extensive proliferation of CD45 + CD33 + myeloid cells around the periphery of the adherent, multinucleated osteoclasts in culture, resembling a multi-cellular hematopoietic niche environment. Further studies are underway to better evaluate the interaction of these osteoclast cells with other hESC-derived hematopoietic cells. Together, these studies demonstrate development of functional osteoclasts directly from hESC-derived CD34 + CD45 + hematopoietic progenitor population. We also show development of a novel in vitro HSC niche microenvironment utilizing hESC-derived osteoclasts. This system has the potential to now incorporate other hESC-derived cell populations as a model to better define cellular and extracellular mechanisms that mediate human hematopoietic development.
