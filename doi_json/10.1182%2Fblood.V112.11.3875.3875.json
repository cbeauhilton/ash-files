    "abstract_text": "Background: Deferasirox is a once-daily oral iron chelator with established dose-dependent efficacy for treating transfusional iron overload. In registration trials, the starting dose was based on baseline liver iron concentration (LIC). The prospective multicenter EPIC trial, the largest ever conducted for an iron chelator, included patients (pts) with a variety of transfusion-dependent anemias and was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fixed starting doses of deferasirox based on transfusion history, with subsequent dose titration based on serum ferritin (SF) trends. One-year results are presented. Methods: Pts (aged \u22652 yrs) had transfusion-dependent anemia and SF levels \u22651000 ng/mL, or 20 transfusions or >100 mL/kg of RBCs) and R2 MRI-confirmed LIC of >2 mg Fe/g dry weight (dw). Deferasirox starting dose was 20 mg/kg/d for pts receiving 2\u20134 blood units/mth. An initial dose of 10 or 30mg/kg/d was considered for pts receiving less or more frequent blood transfusions, respectively. Protocol-specified dose adjustments of 5\u201310 mg/kg/d (range 0\u201340 mg/kg/d) were done every 3 months based on SF trends and safety markers. Primary efficacy endpoint was SF change from baseline (BL) at 1 year. Results: 1744 pts (901 M, 843 F; mean age 30.6\u00b123.3 yrs) were enrolled; 33.1% (n=577) aged 20 mg/kg/d. 39% of pts had dose increases at a median of 24 weeks after treatment initiation (range 2\u201353). Overall, median SF was significantly decreased from BL by 264 ng/mL after 1 year ( P <0.0001) at an average actual received dose of 22.2\u00b15.9 mg/kg/d. SF changes based on average dose the pts received throughout the course of the study are presented in Table 1. The extent of reduction in SF was reflective of dosage adjustments over the study.

The most common drug-related (investigator-assessed) AEs were diarrhea (n=251; 14.4%), rash (n=174; 10.0%), nausea (n=135; 7.7%) and abdominal pain (n=97; 5.6%). 175 pts (10.0%) had serum creatinine value >33% above BL and the upper limit of normal (ULN) on two consecutive visits; there were no progressive increases. 13 (0.7%) had an increase in alanine aminotransferase >10\u00d7ULN on two consecutive visits; levels were already elevated in 11 pts. Conclusions: This large study confirms deferasirox efficacy in achieving a reduction of iron load across a wide range of pts with transfusion-related iron overload. It also supports the clinical approach to fixed starting dose of deferasirox based on iron intake from ongoing blood transfusions and current iron burden with subsequent individual dose titration every 3 months according to SF trends and safety markers. Deferasirox was generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with data from previous clinical trials.",
