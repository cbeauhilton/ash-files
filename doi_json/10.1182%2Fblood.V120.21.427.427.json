    "abstract_text": "Abstract 427 Polycythemia vera (PV) is a clonal stem cell disorder in which there is overproduction of red cells, white cells and platelets, extramedullary hematopoiesis and transformation to myelofibrosis. Enhanced hematopoiesis in PV is due to constitutive activation of JAK2, the cognate tyrosine kinase of type I cytokine receptors such as the erythropoietin and thrombopoietin receptors. Hematopoietic stem cells express the thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl) but paradoxically mice lacking the MPL gene exhibit only thrombocytopenia while maintaining the capacity to not only substantially elevate their platelet and leukocyte counts during marrow reproductive stress but also the number of multipotent and committed hematopoietic progenitor cells as well. Equally paradoxical, Mpl expression is impaired in PV, but how impaired expression of a master regulator of stem cell function could be associated with a global increase in hematopoiesis has been a conundrum. Recently, data were presented (Blood 119: 4625, 2012) suggesting that Mpl down regulation in PV was due to constitutive JAK2 activation, which abrogated the antiproliferative effects of the high plasma thrombopoietin (TPO) levels in PV, thus sustaining the PV phenotype. We have used a JAK2 V617F transgenic mouse model (V617Ftg) (Blood 111:5109, 2009) to examine the role of Mpl in the pathogenesis of the JAK2 V617F-positive PV phenotype and have observed that deletion of the MPL gene ameliorated the PV phenotype in this model, reducing the hemoglobin level, leukocyte and platelet counts and splenomegaly and reversing marrow fibrosis, while the presence of a single MPL gene was sufficient to restore the PV phenotype. However, total deletion of the MPL gene does not perfectly model human PV where Mpl is present but quantitatively reduced. Therefore, we examined the effect of manipulating Mpl behavior in vivo by modifying Mpl signaling while maintaining Mpl expression, first, by eliminating TPO production, and second, by expressing a functionally impaired Mpl receptor, and as a control, specifically impairing megakaryocyte differentiation alone. To this end, we crossbred the V617Ftg PV mouse with a TPO gene knockout mouse (TPO ko), with a mouse homozygous for the MPL mutation, C40R (C40R hom), which in the homozygous state causes thrombocytopenia, and finally, with an MKL1 knockout mouse (MKL1ko) that is thrombocytopenic due to impaired megakaryocyte maturation. Crossbreeding produced the three expected genotypes (JAK2 V617F/TPO ko, JAK2 V617F/C40R hom and JAK2 V617F/MKL1ko) without unexplained mortality or impoverished growth. We compared the blood counts, spleen weights and bone marrow and spleen histology of these three genotypes with each other and with JAK2 V617F/TPO heterozygous (het) mice over a 33 week period. The natural history of the V617Ftg PV mouse is one of initial erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, splenomegaly, and expansion of short term marrow repopulating cells (ST-HSC), common myeloid progenitor cells (CMP) and marrow and spleen committed hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC)(CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, BFU-E, CFU-E and CFU-MK), and myelofibrosis with a subsequent decline in erythrocytosis. Abrogating TPO production in the V617Ftg PV mouse normalized the platelet and leukocyte counts, delayed the development of erythrocytosis, reduced spleen size and ST-HSC, CMP, and all marrow and spleen committed HPC compartments and reversed marrow fibrosis. The V617Ftg PV - C40R MPL cross prevented thrombocytosis, erythrocytosis, leukocytosis and splenomegaly, and reduced all the marrow and spleen committed HPC compartments. By contrast, the V617Ftg PV-MKL1 ko cross slowed the rate of rise of the platelet count and hemoglobin level but had no effect on splenomegaly or marrow fibrosis, nor was there a reduction in any of the marrow or spleen committed HPC. Expression of one TPO gene by crossing the V617Ftg PV mouse with mice heterozygous for the TPO gene (JAK2 V617F/TPO het) restored the PV phenotype. In conclusion, while it is unquestioned that JAK2 V617F is necessary for expression of the PV phenotype, our data indicate that it alone is insufficient and requires not only the expression of a functional TPO receptor but also receptor activation by its cognate ligand TPO. This latter observation suggests that interfering with the TPO-Mpl interaction could be of therapeutic value in the treatment of human PV. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
