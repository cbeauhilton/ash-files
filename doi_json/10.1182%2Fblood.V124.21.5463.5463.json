    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma (LPHL) , also known as Hodgkin paragranuloma or lymphocytic and histiocytic predominant Hodgkin disease. It accounts for 5% of the lymphoma in the western world Since LPHL is a rare type of lymphoma different treatment modalities used to treat it including radiotherapy alone, combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy, chemotherapy alone and recently the use of Rituximab anti CD20 monoclonal antibody as LPHL expresses CD20 marker . The results are variable. Patients of LPHL also have frequent relapses beyond 5 years of treatment as compared to cHL and high rates of transformation to DLBCL . OBJECTIVE: To review outcome of LPHL patients treated with various chemotherapy regimens ( ChlVpp/ABVD) and (ABVD/COPDac) alone or in combination with radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data of total 301 patients reviewed . Out of which 15 were of LP Hodgkin (4.98%). Retrospective review of 15 patients of LP Hodgkin Lymphoma patients enrolled between January 2006 to December 2013 was done. Data regarding age, sex, stage of disease , treatment and outcome was analyzed. RESULTS: Total 15 LP HD patients with age range from 2 to 18 years were included from 2006 to 2013. Mean age of patients was 10 years. Median was 9. Out of these 13 (86.7% ) were males and 2 (13.3%) females, most of them are of stage III (40%). Majority , 9 patients (60 %). were treated with ChlVpp/ABVD protocol. XRT was given to 5 patients (33.3%). Total 12 (80%) are still on follow up and 3 (20%) relapsed. CONCLUSION: Patients of Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma treated with chemotherapy had a better outcome . Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
