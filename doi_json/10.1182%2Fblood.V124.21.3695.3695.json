    "abstract_text": "Background : Although a complete remission (CR) can be achieved in 70-80% of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, relapses occur in up to the 50% of cases. Thus, minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring is a major issue for early detection of patients at high-risk of treatment failure and relapse. Aim : to dynamically evaluate WT1 pan-leukemic molecular marker of MRD in patients with AML. Matherial and methods: 107 newly diagnosed AML patients consecutively treated between 2010 and 2013 were monitored with quantitative WT-1 from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) at baseline, after induction, after the first consolidation course, before allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), at the 3 rd and the 6 th month after transplantation Results : At diagnosis, 104/107 (97%) had increased PB and BM WT1 levels assessed according to the ELN assay. Eighty-eight out of 107 patients (82%) achieved a complete remission (CR) after induction, 30/88 (34%) relapsed during follow up and 24/107 (22%) were addressed to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). By univariate analysis, PB-WT > 50x10^4/ABL and BM-WT1 > 250x10^4/ABL after induction (PB: p=0.02; BM: p=0.04), after consolidation (PB: p=0.003), at the end of treatment (PB and BM: p=0.001), at 3 rd month of follow up (PB and BM: p=0.005) and at 6 th month of follow up (PB: p=0.005) were associated with a reduced overall survival (OS). By multivariate analysis, a BM-WT1 > 250 x 10^4/ABL at the end of treatment was significantly associated with a reduced OS. In order to adapt the cut-off of WT1 in our series of patients, we considered WT1 levels as continuous variables and categorized them at approximately the 25 th , 50 th , and 75 th percentile. A cut-off of PB-WT1 > 25x10^4/ABL and BM-WT1 > 125x10^4/ABL at the end of the treatment program was identified as correlated with reduced leukemia-free survival (LFS) and OS (p=0.001). Similarly, and restricting the analysis on the 24 patients allo-transplanted in CR, 8/11 (73%) with pre-transplant PB-WT1 \u2265 5 and 4/13 (31%) with PB-WT1 < 5 relapsed, respectively (p=0.04). The incidence of relapse was higher in AML patients with PB-WT1 \u2265 5 measured at 3 rd (56% vs 38%; p=0.43) and 6 th month (71% vs 20%; p=0.03) after allo-SCT. Interestingly, 5/5 (100%) patients with pre-transplant PB-WT1 \u2265 5 who never reduced this level at 3 rd or 6 th month after allo-SCT experienced a disease recurrence. Conclusions : our data, although retrospectively collected, show that WT1 monitoring may be useful to predict the relapse in AML patients.
