    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Myelofibrosis (MF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, bone marrow fibrosis, and a propensity toward transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. Type I JAK inhibitors (JAKi) are the only approved therapy and can provide symptom control and reduction of splenomegaly in eligible patients. However, JAKi do not significantly impact disease progression, and many patients are not eligible due to coexisting cytopenias. Patients with MF who have relapsed and/or are refractory (R/R) to JAKi have poor survival. Therefore, novel agents, moving beyond JAKi-based treatments, are urgently needed. CD123, also known as the interleukin-3 receptor alpha chain, is expressed on maturing myeloid cells and progenitors in MF, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Tagraxofusp (TAG, SL-401) is a CD123-targeted therapy which is FDA and EMA approved for the treatment of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. A phase 1/2 study of TAG monotherapy in patients with MF who were R/R to approved JAKi (NCT02268253) was initiated. Herein, we present updated safety and efficacy data. Methods: A 2-stage multicenter, phase 1/2 study enrolled patients with R/R MF. Patients in Stage 1 (dose escalation) received 7, 9, or 12 mcg/kg/day TAG intravenously on days 1-3, every 21 days (cycles 1-4), every 28 days (cycles 5-7), and every 42 days (for cycles 8 and beyond); 12 mcg/kg/day was given every 21 days (cycles 1-4), and every 28 days (cycles 5+) in Stage 2. Enrollment in Stage 2 (expansion) was restricted to patients who met the DIPSS-plus intermediate-2 or high-risk disease criteria, those who were R/R or intolerant to JAKi therapy, and those who were not eligible for immediate stem cell transplantation. Responses were assessed on the basis of the International Working Group MPN Research and Treatment/European LeukemiaNet (IWG-MRT/ELN) criteria (Tefferi et al. Blood 2013;122:1395-1398). Results: As of July 1, 2021, 39 patients with MF were treated. Median age was 70 years (range 54-87) and 46% were female. The baseline characteristics comprised thrombocytopenia (<100 \u00d7 10 9 /L; 64%), including 36% with platelets <50 \u00d7 10 9 /L; monocytosis (\u22651.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L; 21%), and splenomegaly (74%). Genomic assessments at study entry demonstrated molecular mutations in JAK2, CALR, MPL , and ASXL1 in 62%, 8%, 5%, and 23%, respectively; cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in 10 patients (4 patients: 20q-, 3 patients: 7/7q-, 2 patients: -5/5q-, 2 patients: 12p-, and 1 patient: 17q). Treatment-related adverse events are depicted in Table 1. The most common treatment-related adverse events (incidence \u226510%) included hypoalbuminemia (21%), headache, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated alanine aminotransferase (15% each). Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) was reported in 3 patients, including 1 patient with grade 4; there was no grade 5 CLS. Stable disease was achieved in 21 patients (60%). In total, 12/24 patients (50%) with baseline splenomegaly achieved a spleen response (Table 2), 3/4 (75%) with concomitant monocytosis, and 13/24 (54%) with concomitant thrombocytopenia. Spleen responses were confirmed objectively by imaging, with the spleen volume reduction (SVR) thresholds for response set at 35%. Updated information on SVR will be reported at the time of presentation. Total Symptom Score (TSS) was reduced in 20/39 patients (51%), and 10/39 (26%) had reductions from baseline in both TSS and spleen size. Median overall survival was 29.2 months (95% CI 12.0-49.5; range 1-51 months). Conclusions: TAG monotherapy demonstrated clinical efficacy and a predictable and manageable safety profile in patients with MF characterized as high-risk, including those who are refractory to JAKi and those with associated monocytosis, thrombocytopenia, advanced disease, and high-risk genetic features. This phase 1/2 study confirms the safety and clinical efficacy of TAG administered as a monotherapy in a cohort of poor-prognosis patients with MF. Given the genomic and epigenomic complexity of MF, with the clonal heterogeneity and additional subclones, TAG is planned to be tested as part of a combination strategy in high-risk patients with MF who are either R/R, intolerant to, or who have had a prior suboptimal response to JAKi.
