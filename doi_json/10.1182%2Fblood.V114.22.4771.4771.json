    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4771 Approximately 12- 15% of non- Hodgkin lynphoma NHL are caused by malignant Tcell lymphocytes. The success of the treatment in the aggressive form has lagged behind that of B -Cell in term of poor resonse and durability. Peripheral T-Cell lymphoma PTCL and cutaneous T-Cell lymphoma CTCL are two major charachterized classifiction in the World Health Organization based on their morphology, growth patern and genetics. Stem cell transplant and high dose chemotherapy have been associated with long term response rate of 45%. However this treatment is not well tolerated and not feasible for many patients. Other theraputic options include cytotoxic drugs CHOP,CVP regimen, purine analogues, Denileukin diftitox, Histone deacetylation inhibitors and novel antifolates drugs. In this abstract we will show our experience with gemcitabin an active antimetabolite as a single agent or in combination with other active drugs. Eight patients with PTCL, five with visceral stage of mycosis fundoides( one patient with HIV infection), two with refractory anaplastic Ki positive NHL and one with angioimmunoblastic type. All patients failed a minimum two lines of therapy. Mean age 58 years( range 28-75). Eight blacks, two whites, four hispanics and one asian. Meduim cycles given are four. The dose range 800-1000 mg/M2, given weekly x3 every 28 days cycle. Overall response rate is 85%. Complete response rate CR in eight patients ( three PTCL, three mycosis fungoides and two anaplastic large cell NHL). Partial response PR in four and stable disease in one. Median duration of response is nine months, range six to two years. Median time for response is six weeks. In conclusion:Gemcitabine is an active drug in T-Cell lymphomas particularly when used in combination with other active agents. Maintenance dosing or retreatment with this drug should be investigated. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
