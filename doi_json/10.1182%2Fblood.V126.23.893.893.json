    "abstract_text": "Introduction . Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) is a relatively uncommon event with potentially serious complications. Its optimal treatment and clinical outcomes are not well studied. The objective of our study was to assess the safety and efficacy of a standardized management protocol for UEDVT as well as its long term complications. Patients and methods . We conducted a prospective cohort study at 5 Canadian centres and enrolled adult patients with a symptomatic UEDVT confirmed by compression ultrasound involving the brachial or more proximal veins, with or without a pulmonary embolism (PE). Exclusions included pregnancy, dialysis catheter thrombosis, active or high bleeding risk, platelet count <100x10 9 /L, creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min, on warfarin for other indications, hemodynamically unstable PE, acute leukemia or undergoing a stem cell transplant within 3 months, geographical inaccessibility, life expectancy <3 months or treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or warfarin for more than 7 days since diagnosis. Standardized treatment regimens were as follows: spontaneous or central venous catheter (CVC)-related UEDVT were treated with dalteparin at therapeutic doses for at least 5 days followed by warfarin adjusted according to INR results. Spontaneous UEDVT was treated for at least 6 months and CVC-related events were treated for at least 3 months or for as long as the line remained in place and for at least 1 month after line removal. Cancer patients with non CVC-related UEDVT were treated using dalteparin alone for a minimum of 6 months. Main outcomes were objectively documented venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence, major bleeding and death. All outcomes were centrally adjudicated. Patients were followed for 2 years. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Survival data was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier Method. Post-hoc analyses were conducted comparing CVC and spontaneous events. The study was approved by all institutional review boards. Results . Between 2009 and 2012, we enrolled 141 patients: 75 with spontaneous and 66 with CVC related UEDVT. Mean age was 51 years; 55% were males. The population characteristics are shown in the Table. The 2 year cumulative incidence of VTE recurrence was 3.5% (95% CI 1.5-8), of major bleeding was 2.8% (95% CI 1.1-7.1) and of death was 22% (95% CI 16-29.5). VTE recurrence rate was no different for spontaneous vs. CVC-related groups (4% vs. 3%; Log-Rank P = 0.690; Figure). Conclusion . The use of a standardized management protocol for patients with UEDVT results in a low risk of VTE recurrence and major bleeding at 2 years of follow up, in both CVC-related and spontaneous UEDVT.
