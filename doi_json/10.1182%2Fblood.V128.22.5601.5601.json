    "abstract_text": "Background: The amyloidoses comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by misfolding of amyloidogenic proteins and subsequent deposition as amyloid fibrils. To date, over 30 proteins are known to be amyloidogenic (Sipe Amyloid 2014). Immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis, a plasma cell dyscrasia, is the most common subtype. The standard diagnostic algorithm in AL amyloidosis is to obtain a biopsy of a clinically involve organ, and once Congo red positivity is confirmed, perform subtyping analyses with immunohistochemistry or mass spectrometry. Accurate subtyping of amyloidosis is essential to appropriate treatment, as misdiagnosis occurs in up to 10% of patients and may lead to inappropriate administration of chemotherapy (Comenzo Blood 2006; Lachmann NEJM 2002). We sought to determine the patterns of amyloid subtyping among patients with a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis referred to a tertiary referral center for HDM/SCT. Methods: Sequential patients with confirmed amyloidosis, age \u2265 18 years who underwent HDM/SCT between 2001 and 2014 at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington Medical Center were eligible. Presence of a Congo red-positive biopsy for each patient referred for transplant was confirmed and the pathology reports and medical records were reviewed to determine if subtyping was performed, and which modality was used. Results: Fifty-one patients with AL amyloidosis were referred for transplant; of these, 45 proceeded with HDM/SCT. The organ systems most commonly involved were renal in 34/51, and gastrointestinal in 5/51. Of the biopsies, subtyping was performed in 35 (68.6%), and no subtyping was performed in 16 patients (31.3%). Immunofluorescence was the most common modality used for subtyping in 33 biopsies (94.2%) and laser capture/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was used in 2 patients (5.7%). All patients had evidence of a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia by bone marrow biopsy and peripheral blood testing. Of the patients without subtyping, 8 (50%) were diagnosed before 2008. Discussion: Misdiagnosis of amyloidosis due to a lack of appropriate subtyping is a well-described and ongoing problem for patients with amyloidosis. These data suggest that definitive subtyping is still not routinely performed in the evaluation of amyloidosis. At our center, efforts to standardize the evaluation of Congo-red positive biopsies using definitive typing are underway. Disclosures Gopal: Seattle Genetics: Research Funding."
