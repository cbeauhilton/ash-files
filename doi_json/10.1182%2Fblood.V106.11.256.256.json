    "abstract_text": "An aberrant tyrosine kinase signalling due to non-receptor tyrosine kinase JAK2 V617F mutation has been highlighted in the pathogenesis of polycythemia vera (PV). In myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) this mutation has been reported to be present in approximately 50% of the patients and its pathogenetic role is not elucidated. Here we report the results of JAK2 V617F mutation in a retrospective analysis of blood samples from 170 patients with MMM. Search for JAK2 mutation was performed by an allele specific PCR from DNA purified from granulocytes. To evaluate whether the mutation was carried in the homozygous or heterozygous state, digestion of PCR products with BsaXI restriction enzyme was performed. The overall frequency of JAK2 V617F mutation was 60% and homozygosity for the mutation was found in 39.2% of mutant samples. Disease duration was similar in JAK2 mutated and wild type patients. Patients who harboured an homozygous mutation had an higher myeloproliferative severity score (that indexed leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and splenomegaly) than patients who had a wild type or heterozygous genotype. In post-PV MMM, the mutant gene was present in 22/22 (100%) of patients, and the frequency of homozygosity was 59% of the mutated cases. In post-ET MMM (n=13), the mutant gene was present in 46% of the patients, and the frequency of homozygosity was 16% of the mutant samples. In idiopathic MMM (n=135), the incidence of the mutational state was 54.8%, with 35.1% of homozygote mutation. Patients who had received a diagnosis of prefibrotic myelofibrosis (WHO classification) had an incidence of the mutation significantly lower than patients who were diagnosed in the fibrotic stage (6/18, 33% vs 68/112, 60.7%; P=0.001). By considering only patients not receiving cytoreductive or disease modifying agents, patients who had an heterozygote mutation, had a mean Hb value higher than wild type patients (9.4 g/dL vs. 11.4 g/dL; P=0.004). Moreover, patients who had an homozygote mutation had the myeloproliferative severity score higher than both heterozygote and wild type patients (2.26 vs 1.59, P=0.008, and 2.26 vs.1.52, P=0.001, respectively). We conclude that JAK2 V617F mutation is significantly represented in MMM patients. It is a necessary event in the transformation from PV to MMM while not in the transformation from ET to MMM. Patients who harboured an heterozygote state maintained higher Hb values than patients with a wild type genotype, while the homozygote mutation was associated with leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and splenomegaly.",
