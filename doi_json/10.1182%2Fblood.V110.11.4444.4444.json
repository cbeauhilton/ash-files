    "abstract_text": "Background: The phenotypic expression of Hodgkin lymphoma among different ethnic groups is not well described. We conducted a study to look at the characteristics and the clinical response of Hodgkin lymphoma patients of different ethnicities to standard treatment. Method: A retrospective analysis of 65 Hodgkin lymphoma patients diagnosed 2003 through 2006 was undertaken. Patients who have been compliant and completed assigned chemotherapy (ABVD) with or without Involved Field RT were evaluated for response to treatment using CT scan and PET scan. Data was analyzed using fisher exact test. Results: Patients with limited staged disease received 4 to 6 cycles of ABVD +/\u2212 RT while those with advanced staged disease received 6 to 8 cycles of ABVD +/\u2212 RT. All 50 patients achieved objective response. Complete response rates were 52% Hispanic, 68% African American, and 75% Caucasians. (p=0.4) Conclusion: Hodgkin lymphoma is as common in Hispanics as in African American. The mixed cellularity subtype is more common in the Hispanics; however the nodular sclerosis subtype remains the most common histological subtype. Though more Hispanics had an early clinical stage disease at diagnosis, they had a lower complete response rate compared to the other ethnic groups. How this observation will translate into a poorer survival outcome remains to be seen. Results:  . Hispanic . African American . Caucasians . .
