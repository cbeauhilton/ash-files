    "abstract_text": "We hypothesize that immune tolerance after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is maintained by an active cellular mechanism that includes regulators of immune function, CD4 + CD25 + T reg cells. Furthermore, infusion of patient-specific T reg cells might provide therapeutic benefit, improving the control of graft-versus-host (GVH) and host-versus-graft (HVG) reactions after HCT. In preparation for large-scale in viv o studies with T reg in the well-established canine model of HCT, we characterized the in vitro function of canine CD4 + CD25 + T reg cells and asked if canine-specific aAPC could expand T reg cells ex vivo . Responder peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained by leukapheresis and ficoll-hypaque separation ( n = 7 dogs) and cultured in bulk mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) conditions with 3 rd party dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-mismatched, unrelated and irradiated (22 Gy) CD34 + derived dendritic cells (10:1 responder: stimulator ratio) or PBMC (1:1). The starting number of responder cells ranged from 120 \u2013 555 x10 6 CD3 + cells. On day 4 of MLC, cells were incubated with anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (ACT-1). CD25 + cells were isolated by positive immunomagnetic selection (Miltenyi), and assessed for phenotype and in vitro function. After selection, cells were 83% \u2013 97% CD3 + CD4 + CD25 + by flow cytometry. The CD4 + CD25 + T cells expressed the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor foxP3, assessed by Western blot with polyclonal anti-human foxP3 antibody, while CD25 \u2212 T cells did not express foxP3. In addition, the CD4 + CD25 + T reg inhibited proliferation of fresh primary MLCs a median of 79% (range, 54% \u2013 88%) when CD4 + CD25 + cells were added at 1:5 or 1:25 ratio (T reg : responder) and pulsed with 3 H-thymidine after 6 days. CD4 + CD25 + T reg inhibited proliferation of primary MLCs in a cell contact-dependent manner if T reg shared the DLA-type of the responder cells. Addition of CD25 \u2212 T cells did not inhibit MLCs. The yield of CD4 + CD25 + T reg after bulk culture and immunomagnetic selection ranged from 2.2 \u2013 24 x10 6 cells. On day 5 of cell culture, aAPC were added to stimulate and expand the CD4 + CD25 + T reg cells. The aAPC (KT32) expressing the Fc\u03b3 receptor CD32, canine CD86, and human IL-15, were loaded with the canine-specific mitogenic anti-CD3\u03b5 antibody 17.6F9 (0.5 mg/mL) and irradiated (100 Gy) prior to stimulation of CD4 + CD25 + T reg (at 1:1 or 1:10 aAPC:T reg ratio). Seven days later, T reg cells had expanded a median of 23-(range, 8\u201336) fold. The expanded cells maintained the phenotype and in vitro function as T reg prior to expansion. The expanded T reg were 44\u201376% (median, 59%) CD4 + CD25 + , expressed foxP3, and inhibited primary MLCs a median of 85% (range, 64%\u201397%) at a 1:5 ratio. Bulk culture expansion generated a median of 105 (range, 52\u2013135) x10 6 T reg , cell doses that are potentially sufficient for assessment of in vivo function in the dog model of HCT. In summary, canine T reg can be isolated from PBMC following short-term allogeneic stimulation, immunomagnetic selection and expansion with canine-specific aAPC. The expanded T reg maintain the cell phenotype and functional characteristics of allo-stimulated CD4 + CD25 + T reg cells. In future studies, expanded T reg cells will be evaluated for in vivo function to inhibit GVH and HVG reactions in the canine model of allogeneic HCT."
