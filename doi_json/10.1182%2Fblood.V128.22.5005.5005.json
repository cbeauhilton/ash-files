    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is characterized by disseminated thrombus due to the mutations of ADAMTS13, which cleaves its substrate von Willebrand factor(VWF) in shear-induced unfolding condition. Most of the congenital TTP we found is woman with pregnancy. Here, we characterize two children suspected with congenital TTP. Methods: ADAMTS13 activities were analyzed by residual collagen binding assay (R-CBA) plus FRET-VWF substrate. And the inhibitors of ADAMTS13 were analyzed by 9:1 mixture of patient and pooled normal plasma followed by R-CBA. The secretion of recombinant ADAMTS13 mutants was studied. Results: Two children, one aged four months and the other aged three years old, were diagnosed with congenital TTP because their ADAMTS13 activities were less than 5% (both FRET-VWF and R-CBA), and there are short of ADAMTS13 inhibitors. The following mutations were found: Q1385P, Y177C, C522R. In addition to the previously reported mutation of Y177C, the two novel mutations (Q1385P and C522R) failed to secrete from the HEK293 cells. Conclusion: Two children with congenital TTP were determined thanks to screening of ADAMTS13 activity and its corresponding inhibitor assays, and it seems that congenital TTP could occur in different ages although most of congenital TTP we found were women with pregnancy.
