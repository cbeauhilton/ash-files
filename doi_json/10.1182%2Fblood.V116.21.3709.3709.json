    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3709 CD8 + /TCR \u2212 graft facilitating cells (FC) enhance engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). They are distinct from HSC since they do not generate multilineage engraftment when infused alone, nor do they form colonies in vitro. The function of human FC remains to be defined. Here, we phenotypically characterized the human CD8 + /TCR \u2212 FC subpopulations and evaluated their function in vivo and in vitro . Human CD8 + /TCR \u2212 FC comprised 1.1% \u00b1 0.27% of total G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Approximately 55% of FC express CD56 dim/\u2212 , and the remaining population is CD56 bright . In the CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 bright cell population, approximately 65% of cells express CD11c + and 67% of cells express CD11b + . In CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 dim/\u2212 cell population, the majority of cells express CD3\u03b5 + (80%), 17% were CD11c + , 16% were CD19 + , 14% were CD11b + , 11% were CD123 + , and 30% were HLA-DR + . To evaluate whether human CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 dim/\u2212 FC enhance engraftment of human HSC in vivo , we transplanted 100,000 HSC alone or plus 300,000 CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 dim/\u2212 FC into NOD/SCID/IL2r\u03b3 null (NSG) recipient mice conditioned with 325 cGy of total body irradiation. At 30 days after transplantation, 8 of 21 (38%) recipients of HSC alone engrafted. In contrast, 81% of recipients (n = 16) receiving HSC plus CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 dim/\u2212 FC engrafted, and donor lymphocyte and monocyte chimerism in PB was 0.53% \u00b1 0.16% and 3.93% \u00b1 1.28%, respectively. At 6 months after transplantation, NSG recipients of HSC alone lost donor chimerism in PB and no donor cells were detected in spleen and BM. In contrast, NSG recipients of HSC + CD8 + /TCR \u2212 CD56 dim/\u2212 FC exhibited durable donor chimerism in PB and showed significantly higher levels of donor chimerism in spleen (13%) and BM (9.43%) compared to recipients of HSC alone. To evaluate the function of CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 dim/\u2212 FC in vitro , HSC were incubated with CD8 + /TCR \u2212 CD56 dim/\u2212 FC for 18 hrs and then cultured in methylcellulose for 14 days in colony-forming cell assay. HSC plus CD8 + /TCR \u2212 CD56 dim/\u2212 FC generated significantly more colonies compared with HSC alone ( P = 0.0038), suggesting that human CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 dim/\u2212 FC have a direct effect on the clonogenicity of HSC ( Figure ). In summary, our data indicate that (1) human CD8 + /TCR \u2212 FC are a heterogeneous cell population; (2) CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 dim/\u2212 FC enhance engraftment of human HSC in vivo and promote HSC clonogenicity in vitro ; and (3) recipients of CD8 + /TCR \u2212 /CD56 dim/\u2212 FC maintain a durable donor chimerism in BM and spleen.
