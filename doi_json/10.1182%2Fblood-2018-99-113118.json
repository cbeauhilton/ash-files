    "abstract_text": "Despite an array of approved agents for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), most patients eventually relapse after conventional treatments. The adoptive transfer of tumor-targeted T cells has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of patients with chemo-refractory hematological malignancies including MM. While the majority of T cell-based immunotherapeutic studies in the clinic explore genetically modified T cells that target a single tumor-expressed antigen, we have developed a strategy to generate non-engineered T cell lines that simultaneously target multiple MM-expressed antigens, thereby reducing the risk of tumor immune evasion. We manufacture multiTAA-specific T cells targeting the tumor-associated antigens PRAME, SSX2, MAGEA4, NY-ESO-1 and Survivin by culturing patient-derived PBMCs with autologous DCs loaded with pepmixes (15mer peptides overlapping by 11 aminos acids) spanning all 5 target antigens in the presence of a Th1-polarizing/pro-proliferative cytokine cocktail. In our current clinical trial (NCT02291848), we have successfully generated multi-antigen-targeted lines from 18/ of 19 patients thus far, with one in production. The T cell lines comprise of CD3+ T cells (mean 95.6\u00b12.2%) with a mixture of CD4+ (28.9\u00b17.2%) and CD8+ (56.6\u00b17.2%) T cells, which express central and effector memory markers (CD45RO+/CD62L+/CCR7+ -- 1.21\u00b10.2%; CD45RO+/CD62L+/CCR7- -- 15.16\u00b12.5%; CD45RO+/CD62L-/CCR7- -- 56.9\u00b16.3%). All the expanded lines were specific for two to five target antigens with the majority of lines (13 of 18) specific for \u22653, (PRAME: Mean 45, range: 0 to 205 spot forming units (SFU)/2x10 5 input cells ; SSX2 mean: 57, 0 to 583, NYESO1: mean: 51, 0 to 125 , MAGE-A4 Mean: 67, 0 to 377 and Survivin mean: 53, 0 to 51), and did not react against non-malignant autologous recipient cells (2\u00b13% specific lysis; E:T 20:1). We assessed the clonal diversity of the clinical product using TCR v\u03b2 deep sequencing analysis. We found both polyclonality and that the majority (mean 79%; range: 59 to 95%) represented rare T cell clones that were unique to the ex vivo expanded cell line and below levels of detection in the patients peripheral blood prior to infusion, thereby enabling in vivo tracking studies.. To date we have infused 18 patients with at least 2 infusions, 2 weeks apart of doses ranging from 0.5 to 2x10 7 /m 2 . These patients had received a median of 4 lines of prior therapy including high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue. Ten patients were refractory to their latest therapy and had active MM, while 8 were in remission at the time of infusion. At the 6 week evaluation period, of the 10 patients receiving multiTAA-specific T cells to treat active disease, 1 had a complete remission (CR) by the international myeloma working group (IMWG) response criteria, 1 had a partial remission (PR) and 8 others had stable disease (SD). Seven of these 10 patients were infused more than 1 year ago. Although 2 of the 7 subsequently had disease progression, the remaining 5 continue to respond, with sustained CR (1), PR (2) or SD (2). Of the 8 patients in CR at the time of T cell infusion, all remained in CR at the week 6 disease assessment and of the 6 evaluable patients who are >1 year post T cells, only one patient has relapsed, at 7 months after T cell infusion. These clinical responses correlated with the emergence and persistence (>6 months) of \"line-exclusive\" tumor-reactive T cells in patient peripheral blood, as assessed by longitudinal tracking of infused T cell clones using TCR deep sequencing. These infused product-derived T cells were detected in both peripheral blood (mean 0.43% \u00b1SD of 0.3 of the total repertoire) and the marrow (mean 0.61%\u00b10.24% of total repertoire). The expansion of product-derived T cell clones was higher among patients with active MM than in patients treated in remission (active: 0.60\u00b10.39%, remission: 0.2\u00b10.08%, p=0.048). Notably, no patient, including the complete responder, had infusion-related systemic- or neuro-toxicity. Thus, autologous multiTAA-targeted T cells directed to PRAME, SSX2, MAGEA4, NY-ESO-1 and Survivin can be safely administered to patients with MM, in whom they can subsequently be detected long-term in peripheral blood and marrow, and where they produce sustained tumor responses including CR. It will be of interest to discover whether larger or more frequent doses of these T cells can produce further benefit with maintained safety. Disclosures Brenner: Marker: Equity Ownership.
