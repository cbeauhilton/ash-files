    "abstract_text": "Background: The prognostic score for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma was defined as the number of adverse prognostic factors presented at diagnosis. Seven factors had similar independent prognostic effects. This model was validated retrospectively in advanced disease using different therapeutic approaches ( D Hasenclever et al N Eng J Med  339 : 1506 \u201314, 1998 ). Methods: From December 1996 up to October 2005, the GATLA completed a risk-adapted therapy with ABVD and IFRT. Patients with stages I-IIIA without bulky disease, who achieved complete remission (CR) after three cycles of ABVD, favorable group (FG) received only IFRT 25 GY to areas of >2 cm at diagnosis. Patients with FG not in CR after three cycles of ABVD, slow responders (FGSR), all stages IIIB-IV and all bulky disease, unfavorable group (UG) received six cycles of ABVD and IFRT 30 GY at remaining areas after 3 cycles of ABVD. A total of 584 patients, completed therapy; of them 513 were evaluated with the IPS. Patients were divided in three groups according to the number of adverse prognostic factors 0\u20131, 2\u20133, and \u2265 4. Results: The number of patients, complete remission (CR) rate, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OSV) at 5 years according to prognostic factors in the 513 patients were as follows:  IPS . # patients . (%) . # CR . (%) . % EFS . % OSV . 0\u20131 224 (44) 217 (97) 86 95 2\u20133 241 (47) 213 (88) 73 90 \u22654 48 (9) 40 (83) 65 72 P<   0.020  0.001 0.001 IPS . # patients . (%) . # CR . (%) . % EFS . % OSV . 0\u20131 224 (44) 217 (97) 86 95 2\u20133 241 (47) 213 (88) 73 90 \u22654 48 (9) 40 (83) 65 72 P<   0.020  0.001 0.001 View Large A total of 200 patients with FG had a 5 years EFS and OSV of 89% and 98% while 53 patients with FGSR had an EFS and OSV of 66% and 88% respectively (P<0.001). The IPS in FG and FGSR was 0\u20131 of 61% versus 49%, 2\u20133 of 38.5% versus 43% and \u22654 of 0.5% versus 8% respectively (p=0.003). In UG with an EFS and OSV of 72% and 87%, the incidence of IPS 0\u20131 was 29%, 2\u20133 was 54% and \u22654 was 17%. Conclusion: The IPS is an excellent tool to predict outcome. Patients with stages I-IIIA without bulky tumour who did not achieve CR after three cycles of ABVD (FGSR) had poorer IPS than FG. In spite of receiving six cycles of ABVD, those with FGSR instead of three of those with FG had statistically a poor outcome. In the PET-TC era, patients who remain positive after three cycles of ABVD will need an intensified therapy with the purpose of improving the bad prognosis."
