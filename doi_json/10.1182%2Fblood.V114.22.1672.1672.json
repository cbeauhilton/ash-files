High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is the backbone of therapy but uncertainty remains about what additional chemotherapies should be added to HD-MTX to improve response rates. Methods After receiving IRB consent, we retrospectively evaluated patients with PCNSL treated at our hospital with combination M/R/T at initial diagnosis or at relapse. Patients were treated in 28-day induction cycles as follows: HD-MTX (8g/m 2 - dose adjusted based on creatinine clearance) on days 1 and 15; rituximab (375 mg/m 2 ) on days 3, 10, 17, and 24; and temozolomide (150-200 mg/m 2 ) on days 7-11. HD-MTX was given every 2 weeks until complete response (CR) and for 2 additional treatments followed by monthly maintenance treatments for 11 months. Rituximab was given weekly for a total of 8 weeks. Temozolomide was continued for 6 months after CR. Brain MRI was done after every other methotrexate treatment to assess response. Results Sixteen patients were treated between February 2006 and August 2009. Ten patients received MRT as first-line therapy at the time of initial diagnosis and 6 received MRT as salvage therapy at first or second recurrence. The median age of newly diagnosed patients was 58 (range 47-76) and of relapsed patients was 60 (range 46-76). CSF cytology was atypical in 5/15 patients who underwent lumbar puncture (4 first-line, 1 relapse). After first-line therapy, there were 9 CRs (median cycles to CR = 3) and 1 PR (patient still receiving induction treatment). After salvage therapy, there were 4 CRs (median cycles to CR = 4) and 2 PRs (both patients died while receiving treatment- 1 from an unrelated myocardial infarction). With a median follow-up of 10.3 months in the first-line group and 7.2 months in the relapse group, only 3 patients have progressed; one of whom had clinical progression after a PR and a second who relapsed in the skin. Treatment was well tolerated with reversible grade 4 transammonitis in 1 patient and grade 3 hematological toxicities in 8 patients. One patient experienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia related to temozolomide requiring dose reduction for subsequent cycles. Conclusions Combination MRT is well tolerated and resulted in a promising early response rate. The median number of cycles needed to achieve a CR for patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL was less than the 6 cycles we have previously reported for HD-MTX monotherapy suggesting that adding rituximab and temozolomide is beneficial to patients. This combination warrants further evaluation in larger scale, prospective studies. Disclosures Off Label Use: temozolomide and rituximab for PCNSL..",
