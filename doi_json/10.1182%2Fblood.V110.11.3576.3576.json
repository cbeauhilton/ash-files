    "abstract_text": "T-cell lymphoma associated hemophagocytic syndrome (T-LAHS) has been regularly reported in Asia countries and is considered with extremely poor prognosis. The rate of definite diagnosis during early stage is low and the therapeutic outcome has been disappointed. We therefore compared T-cell lymphoma patients with and without hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) in order to have a better understanding of the clinical characteristics of T-LAHS. One hundred and thirteen patients (66 men and 47 women, age from 12 to 80 years with the median age of 42) with aggressive T-cell lymphoma admitted to our department between January 2000 and December 2005 were included in this study, while 28 of them were with T-LAHS. The patients were divided into LAHS group and no-LAHS group. The clinical data including clinical manifestations and laboratory findings were compared between the two groups by using Chi-square test. The method of Kaplan and Meier was used to analyze overall survival (OS). The results showed that LAHS occured in about 1/4 of all the patients with T-cell lymphoma, which were all aggressive type. The elevated rates of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin were much higher in LAHS group than in no-LAHS group. \u03b2 2 -microglobulin and ovarian cancer antigen (CA125) were also elevated in both groups, but there was no significant difference. The rate of hypo-fibrinogen and liver dysfunction were higher in LAHS group than that in no-LAHS group. The rate of bone marrow infiltration in LAHS group is remarkably higher than that in no-LAHS group (57% vs 32%, p<0.05). The median survival was 40 days (16 days - 22 months) in the LAHS group, and the median survival of 11 patients accepted chemotherapy more than 2 courses was 6 months. By contrast, the 2-year survival for no-LAHS group was 43%. There was significant difference between the two groups. Three patients undergoing plasmapheresis as initial therapy had survived for 3\u20136 months. These results indicate that high suspicion is required for early diagnosis of T-LAHS. In patients with fever, hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenia, simultaneously with serum markers such as LDH, ferritin, TG, CA125, and \u03b2 2 -microglobulin constantly increasing, T-LAHS should be considered. For patients without extranodal invasion or enlargement of lymph nodes, repeating biopsy of multiple sites of bone marrow may help improving the diagnosis rate. As for treatment, other more intensive regimens were not superior to CHOP regimen. While the overall outcome of treatment is still unsatisfied, plasmapheresis as initial therapy is worth considering."
