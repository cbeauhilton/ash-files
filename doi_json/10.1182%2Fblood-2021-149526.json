    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic neoplasm resulting from abnormal proliferation and accumulation of clonal myeloid precursor cells. The course and prognosis of AML vary depending on the type of AML, karyotype, and molecular abnormalities. In addition, patient-related factors and comorbidities are of prognostic relevance. Cardiac comorbidities are of particular importance as they influence treatment tolerability, early death (ED) and survival in patients receiving chemotherapy. Brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a well-established marker of cardiac function and often used to predict treatment tolerability and outcome. However, so far, little is known about the impact of NT-proBNP levels on the clinical course in patients with AML. We analyzed 312 AML patients (median age: 61 years; range 17-89 years; 125 pg/mL), moderately elevated (125-2000 pg/mL), and highly elevated NT-proBNP levels (p=0.0002). The median OS in these groups was 3.08 (IQR 0.8-16.5), 1.14 (IQR 0.5-4.8), and 0.34 (IQR 0.04-3.7) years, respectively (Figure 2). In multivariate analysis including NT-proBNP, age, ELN-2009 classification, WBC, sex, and CCI, NT-proBNP remained an independent predictive variable for OS (p=0.006). Significant differences were also observed when analyzing OS in patients <60 years (p=0.012) but were not seen in those aged \u226560 years (p=0.203). Similar results were obtained for continuous complete remission (CCR) (median CCR of all patients: 1.6 years), where NT-proBNP was of prognostic significance in the cohort aged <60 years (p=0.011) but not in patients aged \u226560 years. Together, NT-proBNP is a new emerging biomarker and independent prognostic factor indicating the risk of induction failure, ED and reduced survival in patients with AML. The predictive power of NT-proBNP is particularly strong in AML patients aged <60 years.
