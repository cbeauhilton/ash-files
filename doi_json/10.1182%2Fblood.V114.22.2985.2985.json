However, predictive laboratory parameters have not been identified. High platelet count (PLC) and increased soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) have been reported as risk factors in cancer patients, so we investigated sP-selectin and PLC as risk markers in glioma patients. Methods The Cancer and Thrombosis Study (CATS) is a prospective observational study, whose endpoint is the occurrence of objectively confirmed VTE. sP-selectin was measured in the third week after neurosurgical intervention using a human sP-selectin Immunoassay (R&D Systems\u00ae, Minneapolis, USA). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was applied to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for VTE, including PLC, sP-selectin, age, sex and type of surgery. Results 140 patients with newly diagnosed high grade glioma were analysed (52 women; median age 54.5 years [interquartile range (IQR): 42.8-5.1]) during a median observation time of 309 (range: 3-1664) days. Twenty patients developed VTE (6 women, 14 men), of which 2 events were fatal pulmonary embolisms. The cumulative probability of VTE was 10% at six and 15% at twelve months. sP-selectin levels (ng/mL) were higher in patients with VTE compared to those without (median=51.8, IQR: 36.9\u201366.0 versus median=38.8, IQR: 30.7\u201352.1, p=0.011). Interestingly, PLC (G/l) was significantly lower in patients with (median=214, IQR: 166-248) than in those without VTE (median=255, IQR: 200-327; p=0.011). In multivariable regression analysis high sP-selectin (75 th percentile: 55.1ng/mL) and low PLC (25 th percentile: 198G/L) were significant risk markers of VTE (HR=3.4, 95% CI 1.3-9.0, and HR=3.3, 95% CI 1.2-8.8, respectively). Conclusion Our study revealed two strong predictive markers for VTE in glioma patients. Elevated sP-selectin is associated with a three-fold increased risk of thrombosis. In contrast to patients with other solid tumours, in glioma patients low PLC is associated with increased thrombosis risk.
