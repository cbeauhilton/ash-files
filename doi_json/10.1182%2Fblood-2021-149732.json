    "abstract_text": "The CARD11-Bcl10-Malt1 (CBM) signalosome controls TAK1 activation to regulate B-cell receptor (BCR)-induced NF-\u03baB activation and B cell biology. The biological function of caspase recruitment domain family member 19 (CARD19), originally identified as a BCL10-interacting CARD protein (BinCARD), is not known. Here we found CARD19 strongly interacted with TAK1 but not BCL10 or other CBM components and prevented TAK1's association with TAB2, thereby inhibiting TAB2-mediated TAK1 ubiquitination and activation and subsequent NF-\u03baB activation. CARD19 was ubiquitously expressed in hematopoietic lineages but its deficiency in mice had no effect on hematopoiesis, including B cell development and humoral immune response. CARD19 deficiency enhanced clonal deletion, receptor editing and anergy of self-reactive B cells, thus reducing autoantibody production in vivo. Mechanistically, CARD19 deficiency led to an increase of BCR/TAK1-mediated NF-\u03baB activation. Activation of NF-\u03baB, such as c-Rel, was responsible for the up-regulation of BCR-induced expression of the transcription factor early growth response genes 2 and 3 (Egr2, Egr3) and the E3 ubiquitin ligases, c-Cbl and Cbl-b, the important inducers of B-cell tolerance in B cells. Further, high-throughput RNA sequencing analysis revealed that CARD19 deficiency did not affect the overall antigen-induced gene expression in na\u00efve B cells but suppressed BCR signaling to increase hyporesponsiveness of self-reactive B cells. Consequently, CARD19 deficiency prevented Bm12-induced experimental systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and autoimmunity in a B cell-intrinsic manner. Taken together, CARD19 negatively regulates BCR-induced NF-\u03baB activation via blocking TAK1/TAB2 interaction and its deficiency leads to NF-\u03baB-induced expression of Egr2/3 and c-Cbl/Cbl-b in self-reactive B cells, which enhances B-cell tolerance and thus prevents autoimmunity.
