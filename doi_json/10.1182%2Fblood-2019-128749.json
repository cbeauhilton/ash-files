    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Current therapies for multiple myeloma (MM), such as immunomodulatory agents, proteasome inhibitors, stem-cell transplantation, and monoclonal antibodies against tumor-associated antigens have greatly improved patient survival. However, MM remains an incurable disease as most patients will eventually relapse. Recent advances in targeted T-cell therapies have shown promise in clinical trials but the adaptive immune system may be insufficient to eradicate all MM clones. In contrast, treatments harnessing the innate immune system have been relatively underdeveloped in MM despite evidence suggesting a role of innate immunity in the efficacy of existing therapies. Innate or innate-like cells, such as NK and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, have the potential to display strong anti-tumor activity, and strategies aimed to improve or re-direct their cytotoxicity represent a new opportunity for cancer immunotherapies and a complementary approach to existing therapies. Here we describe the preclinical characterization of CTX-8573, a novel multispecific antibody that targets B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) on tumor cells and promotes potent cytotoxicity by NK and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells through engagement of the activating receptors NKp30 and CD16a. Method: Bispecific constructs were generated by appending two common-light chain compatible anti-NKp30 Fab fragments to the C-terminus of an anti-BCMA IgG1 antibody containing an afucosylated Fc for enhanced CD16a engagement. To test the effects of targeting NKp30 alone, variants were expressed with an aglycosylated Fc to eliminate CD16a binding. In-vitro assays were performed with primary NK or \u03b3\u03b4 T cells to determine innate-cell activation, cytokine production, proliferation, and target-cell cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines with a range of BCMA expression levels. In-vivo efficacy studies were performed in multiple humanized mouse models and pharmacokinetics and safety were evaluated in Cynomolgus monkeys. Results: CTX-8573 is highly expressed in CHO cells with minimal aggregation and displays stability, solubility, and binding to BCMA and NKp30 equivalent to the parental monoclonal antibodies. By engaging NKp30 and CD16a, CTX-8573 promotes potent cytotoxicity of BCMA expressing target cells by NK and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with >100 fold reduced EC50 compared to the corresponding BCMA monoclonal antibody control. CTX-8573 also demonstrates robust killing of low BCMA expressing cell lines including RPMI-8226 where monoclonal BCMA antibodies lack activity. An aglycosylated variant of CTX-8573 lacking CD16a binding maintains cell killing activity, demonstrating that engagement of NKp30 alone is sufficient to promote innate cell activation and cytotoxicity, although activity is enhanced by CD16A engagement. Furthermore, CTX-8573 maintains its cytotoxic activity in presence of soluble BCMA or BCMA ligands APRIL and BAFF. CTX-8573 does not induce innate cell activation, cytokine production, or killing in the absence of BCMA expressing target cells, supporting a wide therapeutic window. Additionally, unlike daratumumab, CTX-8573 does not induce NK-cell fratricide. In-vivo , CTX-8573 demonstrates anti-tumor efficacy in multiple humanized mouse models including killing of low BCMA expressing cell lines. In Cynomolgus monkeys, CTX-8573 displays standard biphasic pharmacokinetics with a 16 day \u03b2-phase half-life and has no evidence of systemic immune activation as measured by C-reactive protein levels. Lastly, NKp30 expression is maintained on bone marrow NK cells from MM patients including the presence of a significant NKp30+CD16a- subpopulation. Conclusion: CTX-8573 represents a novel class of bispecific antibodies that promote potent tumor cell killing by NK and \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells through engagement of the activating receptors NKp30 and CD16a. CTX-8573 demonstrates strong anti-tumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo, a wide therapeutic window with no evidence of systemic toxicity, and monoclonal-like pharmacokinetics and manufacturability. Together, these data highlight the potential of CTX-8573 as a novel treatment for MM either alone or as a complement to existing therapies.
