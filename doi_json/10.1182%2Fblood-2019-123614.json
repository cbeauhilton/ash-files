    "abstract_text": "Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) is a heterogenous group of disorders. The clinical presentations of LGLL are highly variable; it may present with neutropenia or anemia, complicated with recurrent infections, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and neurological symptoms, requiring therapeutic interventions. It may present only with indolent laboratory changes without any symptoms. The cytological phenotypes of LGLL also vary and they commonly include CD8 + TCR \u03b1\u03b2-type, CD4 + TCR \u03b1\u03b2-type, and NK cell-type. NK cell-type LGLL is designated as chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cells (CLPD-NK). TCR \u03b3\u03b4-type LGLL (\u03b3\u03b4T-LGLL) is even rarer and it often confers cytopenia. The genetic backgrounds of LGLL with CD8 + TCR\u03b1\u03b2-type, CD4 + TCR\u03b1\u03b2-type and NK cell-type have been elucidated with the recent sequencing technologies. JAK/STAT signaling genes and chromatin-modifying genes were frequently mutated in the non-leukemic counterpart of the lymphoid malignancies with \u03b3\u03b4 TCR immunophenotypes, such as hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma and primary cutaneous gamma delta T-cell lymphoma. However, the genetic basis of \u03b3\u03b4T-LGLL and the genetic-phenotypic associations remain unclear. The aim of this study is to identify clinical and genetic characteristics of \u03b3\u03b4T-LGLL in comparison with other LGL leukemias. In total, 56 LGLL patients were recruited; six patients with \u03b3\u03b4T-LGLL, 25 CD8+ TCR\u03b1\u03b2 type, 8 CD4+TCR \u03b1\u03b2 type and 17 CLPD-NK, in this study. All cases were negative for EBV. The median age of patients with \u03b3\u03b4T-LGLL was 48 years old and five of them were male. The median LGL counts and hemoglobin level were 1.81 \u00d710 9 /L (range; 0.60-4.42) and 5.8 g/dL (range; 3.0-11.2), respectively. All patients with \u03b3\u03b4T-LGLL had anemia and/or neutropenia, although no patients were thrombocytopenic. 4 patients presented with pure red cell aplasia. Common immunophenotypes of \u03b3\u03b4T cells were CD2+ CD3+ CD4-CD7+. 3 patients were CD8 + . CD16, CD56 and CD57 were positive in 3, 0, and 1 patient, respectively. \u03b3\u03b4T cells of all patients showed a monoclonal pattern of TCR\u03b3 gene rearrangements with BioMed 2 protocol. We performed amplicon sequencing of entire coding regions of STAT3 , STAT5B and TNFAIP3 genes and allele-specific PCR for several hot spot regions of STAT3 and STAT5B genes using extracted DNA from mononuclear cells of peripheral blood. Mutations in STAT3 and TNFAIP3 were identified in 100% (6/6) and 17% (1/6), respectively. Among the10 STAT3 mutations identified, 5 were located in the SH-2 domain, while other 3 were in coiled-coiled domain and the other 2 were in the DNA binding domain. The median variant allele frequencies of STAT3 was 2.0% (0.7-22.6) and STAT3 mutations were restricted to sorted \u03b3\u03b4T cells in all 3 patients examined. No patient was positive for STAT5B mutations, including N642H and Y665F with allele specific PCRs. One of 5 patients who were treated with cyclosporin A was refractory. Two patients were treated with cyclophosphamide, showing clinical improvements. The patients with \u03b3\u03b4T-LGLL were younger than those with other types of LGLL ( P =0.048) and anemia and STAT3 mutations were significantly more frequent in \u03b3\u03b4T-LGLL ( P value; 0.003 and 0.02, respectively).\u3000PRCA was a consistent cause of anemia in \u03b3\u03b4T-LGLL. Low frequency of STAT5B mutations among \u03b3\u03b4T-LGLL patients was in contrast to other aggressive \u03b3\u03b4T cell lymphoma in which STAT5B frequently mutated. The clinical characteristics of \u03b3\u03b4T-LGLL patients may be defined by younger age and the anemia due to pure red cell aplasia, and the frequent STAT3 mutations might be a novel molecular marker for \u03b3\u03b4T-LGLL.
