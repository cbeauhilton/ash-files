    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2993 Poster Board II-970 NK cells play an important role in cancer immunosurveillance and may prevent tumor progression and metastasis due to their ability to mediate direct cellular cytotoxicity and by releasing immunoregulatory cytokines which shape adaptive immune responses. Their reactivity is governed by various activating and inhibitory molecules expressed on target cells and reciprocal interactions with other hematopoietic cells like dendritic cells. Platelets contribute to tumor immune escape, metastasis, and angiogenesis (e.g. Jin et al Nature Med. 2006). In mice, thrombocytopenia inhibits metastasis, and this is reversed by NK cell depletion suggesting that platelets are an important additional player in NK cell-tumor interaction. However, the knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms by which platelets influence NK cells is fragmentary at best. We found recently that platelet release soluble factors, most notably TGF-\u03b2, upon interaction with tumor cells which mediates NK cell silencing through downregulation of the activating immunoreceptor NKG2D (Kopp et al., Cancer Res 2009, in press). However, immunoregulatory molecules residing in the platelet membrane may also modulate NK cell anti-tumor responses. We report here that presence of platelets causes coating of tumor cells, and this markedly reduces NK cell lysis of tumor cells. This is mediated by conferment of \u201cpseudoexpression\u201d of platelet-expressed immunoregulatory molecules to tumor cells which are absent on the tumor cells alone. Among those immunregulatory molecules we identified various ligands for NK cell receptors like MHC class I, GITR ligand or CD62P. To establish the functional significance of tumor cell pseudoexpression of platelet molecules we employed functional analyses of tumor cells and NK cells with or without coating by autologous platelets. The impaired anti-tumor reactivity of NK cells against coated tumor cells was restored by blocking MHC class I on the coating platelets, while isotype control had no effect. Moreover, coating of tumor cells by platelets was validated by ex vivo analyses of primary leukemic cells from patients which also revealed substantial coating by platelets and confered expression of NK cell-modulating molecules. Our data indicate that platelets enable a molecular mimicry of tumor cells, which enables tumor cells to escape NK cell-mediated tumor immunosurveillance.
