    "abstract_text": "Introduction: The use of B-cell receptor (BCR) signal inhibitors-based therapies (e.g., Ibrutinib) for B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was initiated just a few years ago but has rapidly escalated due to their clinical efficacy and relative ease of use. However newer therapeutic approaches are needed due to multiple issues including the continued need to improve complete responses and reduce toxicity profiles. To that end our group has discovered a novel membrane target in the ubiquitous presence of Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (Axl RTK) on CLL B-cells and has reported that the Axl RTK inhibitor TP-0903 is able to induce apoptosis of CLL B-cells at nanomolar doses (Sinha, Clin Cancer Res, 2015). Given this we assessed if TP-0903 would be effective in the induction of apoptosis of leukemic B-cells from CLL patients who are currently on Ibrutinib therapy or whom have relapsed while on Ibrutinib treatment. Methods: Relapsed/refractory CLL patients (n=22) who were placed on Ibrutinib for progressive disease provided blood samples at a median of 3.2 months after Ibrutinib therapy initiation for these studies. We also obtained sequential samples on 8 patients from initial start of ibrutinib therapy and then over a 6 month follow-up period. CLL B-cells from these blood samples were subject to Ficoll separation, purified by using a Rosette Sep B-cell enrichment kit and then studied by flow cytometry to determine Axl RTK expression levels by flow cytometric analysis. Purified CLL B-cells (CD19+/CD5+) were cultured with TP-0903 in vitro at increasing doses (0.01\u00b5M - 0.50\u00b5M) for 24 hours and the LD50 dose was determined. In addition, 3 CLL patients who had been on Ibrutinib therapy and had a documented relapse were studied in similar fashion using TP-0903. LD50-sensitivity was measured. \"LD50-sensitivity\" was defined as an LD50 \u22640.50\u00b5M and \"insensitive\" was defined as an LD50 dose >0.50\u00b5M. CLL prognostic factors (e.g., FISH, IGHV mutation status, Rai stage, CD38, and CD49d) were evaluated at the time of ibrutinib treatment. Differences in factors between sensitive and insensitive cases were computed using the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and Chi-square test for categorical variables. Results: Twenty-two CLL patients (5 female, 17 male) were included in the analysis. Fourteen (64%) patients were found to be TP-0903 LD50-sensitive. Axl expression on CLL B-cells for this cohort was heterogeneous with a median of CD19+/CD5+ cells positive for Axl at 69.9% (range of 2.7-91.3%). The sensitive subjects tended to be younger with a median age at Ibrutinib treatment initiation of 62 vs 75.5 years (p=0.004). There were no significant differences in gender, FISH, IGHV mutation status, CD38, CD49d, or Rai stage between the sensitive and insensitive LD50 groups. There were no significant differences in relation to median Axl expression on CLL B-cells (sensitive: 72.6%, range: 2.7-91.3%; insensitive: 41.5%, range: 16.5-83.1%; p=0.35). The median number of treatments prior to initiation of ibrutinib did not differ between sensitivity groups (sensitive: 2.53, range: 8-10; insensitive: 43.5, range 12-20; p=0.2833). Association for ZAP70+ CLL B-cells tended to have more apoptosis induction by TP-0903 (sensitive: 84.6% ZAP70+; insensitive: 42.9% ZAP70+; p=0.052). In 8 CLL patients that were studied sequentially while on Ibrutinib continued to express Axl or increased their Axl expression (n=2) over a 3-6 month follow-up period. Three CLL patients who had relapsed on Ibrutinib were sensitive to TP-0903 with LD50 values of \u22640.50\u00b5M. Summary: Here we find that CLL B-cells from over 60% of relapsed CLL patients on Ibrutinib therapy were highly sensitive to the high-affinity Axl inhibitor TP-0903 with induction of apoptosis at nanomolar doses (\u22640.50\u00b5M). The sensitivity of CLL B-cells to TP-0903 appears to be independent of Axl expression levels and of the known CLL prognostic factors but more evident for younger patients and for ZAP70+ expression status. Given this level of activity for apoptosis induction of CLL B-cells by TP-0903 encourages the further testing of this drug in clinical trials for CLL patients.
