    "abstract_text": "Pediatric ALL is the most common childhood tumor and the leading cause of childhood cancer deaths. To gain a better understanding of the landscape of somatic mutations in ALL, we performed whole exome and targeted sequencing of 240 pediatric B-ALL patients with their matched remission samples. The significantly mutated genes fall into several common categories: RAS/receptor tyrosine kinases, epigenetic regulators, transcription factors involved in lineage commitment and p53/cell cycle pathway. RAS/receptor tyrosine kinases: the most frequently mutated genes were members of RAS signaling ( NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, PTPN11 ). Besides the well know hotspot mutations [G12D/V/C ( NRAS 13 cases, KRAS 13 cases), G13D ( NRAS 14 cases, KRAS 11 cases) and Q61H/L/R/K ( NRAS 15 cases, KRAS 1 case)], novel mutational sites were also identified for KRAS : A146T/P (3 cases), K117N/T (4 cases) and V14I (1 case). High frequency missense mutations of PTPN11 clustered in SH2 domain (included the canonical hotspot A72T (5 cases) and E76K/V (4 cases)) and tyrosine-phosphatase catalytic domain (G503R/V). For FLT3, well-appreciated activating hotspot mutations in the kinase domain (D835Y/Y842C) and several novel recurrent mutationswere identified. Epigenetic regulators: hotspot mutations were identified in histone H3K36 methyltransferase WHSC1 . Mutation E1099K located in the SET domain, was identified in 10 patients as well as two of the 5 ALL cell lines that we sequenced (RS4;11, SEM). Stable silencing of E1099K mutant WHSC1 in RS4;11 cells by either lentiviral shRNA or CRISPR guide RNA (sgRNA) markedly reduced clonogenic growth both in vitro and in vivo , underscoring the critical role of WHSC1 in lymphoid malignancies. Two highly-related histone/non-histone acetyltransferases, CREBBP and EP300, were also prominently mutated in our cohort. Mutations of CREBBP predominantly occurred in the acetyltransferase domain, particularly in the hotspot R1446C/H. Mutations of chromatin remodeling genes ( ARID1A and ARID2 ) have been identified in a number of cases. Silencing of ARID1A in ALL cell lines by lentiviral shRNA resulted in upregulation of the pro-growth regulator c-MYC, while forced expression of ARID1A reduced c-MYC luciferase reporter activity. In addition, silencing of ARID1A by either shRNA or CRISPR-sgRNA resulted in enhanced clonogenic growth, suggesting that ARID1A may be involved in the c-MYC pathway and modulates the ALL cell proliferation. Mutations of epigenetic regulators were also found in the polycomb complex ( EZH2, EED, SUZ12 ), chromatin/nucleosome structure modifying proteins ( CHD2, CHD3 , CHD4 ), TET family proteins [ TET1 (2 cases), TET2 (5 cases)] and histone modification proteins ( HDAC1, SIRT1, BCOR, BRD8 , lysine demethylase PHF2 / KDM6A, histone acetyltransferase KAT6B ). Transcription factors and p53/cell cycle pathway: a number of alterations of transcription factors essential for hematopoietic and lymphoid differentiation were noted including the lineage regulator PAX5 (5 missense, 3 indels) and ETV6 (6 cases, 3 were frameshift indel and 1 was a splice-site mutations). In addition, mutations were also found in other lineage transcription factors ( IKZF2, IKZF3, EBF1), WT1 (6 cases, including 3 indels and 1 stop-gain mutations), RUNX family member [ RUNX2 (7 cases), RUNX1 (1 case)], ERG1 (3 cases), GATA1/3 (1 case each) and CTCF. Somatic mutations of genes involved in the p53 pathway occurred in 18 patients, including TP53, ATM and the kinases that regulate p53 activities ( HIPK1 , HIPK2 ). Germline TP53 pathogenic variants were found in these 2 patients. Taken together, we extensively interrogated the mutational landscape of a large cohort of pediatric ALL samples by exome and targeted resequencing. This study provides a detailed mutational portrait of pediatric ALL and gives new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disease.
