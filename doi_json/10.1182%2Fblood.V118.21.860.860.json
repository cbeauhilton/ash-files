    "abstract_text": "Abstract 860 During bone marrow transplantation, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) are exposed to various stress signals, and undergo homing, rapid proliferation and differentiation in order to achieve engraftment. To explore how fate decisions are made under such stress conditions, we developed a novel imaging-based competitive marrow transplantation in zebrafish. The feasibility of handling hundreds of zebrafish for transplantation per day allowed us to screen a library of 480 small molecules with known bioactivity, aimed at identifying new drugs and pathways regulating HSPC engraftment. Two structurally related eicosanoids, 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) and 14,15-EET, were able to enhance GFP+ marrow engraftment compared to DsRed2+ engraftment in zebrafish. This remarkable effect of EETs on adult marrow prompted us to study the effect of EETs in embryonic hematopoiesis. Treating zebrafish embryos with 11,12-EET during definitive hematopoiesis increased the HSPC marker Runx1 expression in the AGM (Aorta-Gonad-Mesonephros), resulting in a significant increase of HSPC in the next hematopoietic site, caudal hematopoietic tissue, the equivalent of fetal liver/placenta in mammals. The same treatment condition also induced ectopic Runx1 expression in the tail mesenchyme, a non-hematopoietic tissue. Microarray analysis on EET-treated zebrafish embryos revealed an upregulation of genes involved in stress response, especially Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) family members. Genetic knockdown experiments confirmed AP-1 members, especially JunB and its binding partners, cFos and Fosl2 , are required for Runx1 induction. Motif analysis also predicted several conserved AP-1 binding sites in the Runx1 enhancer regions. To understand how EETs induced AP-1 expression, a suppressor screen was performed in zebrafish embryos. The screen revealed that activation of both PI3K/Akt and Stat3 are required for induced AP-1 expression, and therefore Runx1 upregulation. Similarly, ex vivo treatment of mouse whole bone marrow with 11,12-EET resulted in a 2-fold increase of long-term repopulating units. Microarray data had previously shown that Cyp2j6 , one of the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in EET biosynthesis from arachidonic acid, is enriched in quiescent mouse long-term HSCs. To further increase the EET levels in HSPCs, human CYP2C8 enzyme was over-expressed in transgenic mice using the Tie2 promoter. These transgenic mice have a 4-fold increase of long-term multi-lineage repopulating unit compared to their wild-type siblings. In purified mouse HSPCs, EETs directly and cell-autonomously activate PI3K/AKT pathway. Co-treatment of mouse bone marrow with EET and a PI3K inhibitor, LY294,002, completely blocked EET-induced enhancement of mouse bone marrow engraftment. In conclusion, we performed the first competitive marrow transplantation-based chemical screen, leading to the discovery of arachidonic acid-cytochrome P450-EETs as a novel modulator of HSC cell fate decision. PI3K/Akt and Stat3 pathways activated by EETs are required for adult HSPC engraftment and/or embryonic HSC specification, partially through transcriptional regulation of AP-1. We also demonstrated the requirement of AP-1 family members for Runx1 expression during embryonic development. This discovery may have clinical application in marrow or cord blood transplantation.
