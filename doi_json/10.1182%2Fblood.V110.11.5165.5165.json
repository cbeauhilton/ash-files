    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND. Patterns, prevalence, and associated pt variables of CML pts\u2019 nonadherence (PNA) with ImRx are being better understood. Reducing ImRx PNA may impact on treatment outcomes. Various AESs have been proposed but their perceived value and clinical applicability to treating MDs are unknown. OBJECTIVES. 1. Describe the perceptions of ImRx prescribing MDs of the utility (in terms of FX, FB, CO) of 13 AESs. 2. Describe MD rankings of the applicability in daily practice of each AES. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS. MD data subset from prospective, 90d observational, open-label, multicenter study [ 1 ]. 51 evaluable MDs: age 45.6\u00b111.2 years (ys); ys of practice 17.7\u00b18.1; 74% hematologists, 26% oncologists; 65.3% practicing in university(-affiliated) hospital, 34.7% in other hospitals. MEASUREMENTS. Utility rated 0=none to 3=high. For applicability to daily practice, MDs were asked to give top 5 AESs (5=most applicable); nonranked AESs were given zero value. RESULTS. See Table 1. CONCLUSIONS. MDs tended to rate the utility and applicability of AESs higher if an AES involved active MD participation or decision-making. AESs requiring significant patient involvement, behaviorally or through assistive devices, were perceived as less helpful and applicable in clinical practice. Importantly, the critical role of patient education was recognized, thus challenging clinicians to accept greater responsibility for this AES. Nurses in particular may prove pivotal in patient education. These findings provide significant direction for interdisciplinary healthcare education, especially in terms of chronic illness management. Further research is needed to elucidate the physician-centric approach to adherence enhancement in CML pts on ImRx.
