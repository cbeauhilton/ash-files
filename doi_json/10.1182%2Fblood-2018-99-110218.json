    "abstract_text": "Several HOX loci associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to regulate transcription of HOX genes through influencing epigenetic landscape. Especially, the posterior HOXA domain associated lncRNA HOTTIP acts as an epigenetic regulator that recruits WDR5/MLL complex to coordinate active chromatin modifications and HOXA genes expression in the development of animal digits. Despite HOX genes, especially HOXA genes, are highly expressed in many acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, it remains largely unknown whether and how HOTTIP lncRNA regulates hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and contributes to leukemogenesis. We showed previously that disruption of the CTCF boundary located between HOXA7 and HOXA9 genes ( CBS7/9 ) resulted in reduced lncRNA HOTTIP and HOXA genes expression in MLL rearranged AML suggesting that HOTTIP may play a role in ectopic expression of the posterior HOXA gene. We employed a pooled CRISPR-Cas9 KO library to specifically screen lncRNAs in four HOX gene loci and identify HOTTIP as acritical regulator in controlling oncogenic HOX chromatin signature and associated gene expression patterns in AML by collaborating with posterior HOXA chromatin boundary. HOTTIP is upregulated in AML patients with MLL -rearrangement or NPM1 mutation. AML patients with high HOTTIP expression exhibits a significantly shortened survival compared to low HOTTIP expressing patients. To test whether HOTTIP acts to coordinate posterior chromatin domain and HOXA genes activation in AML, we manipulated HOTTIP lncRNA expression levels in the MLL-AF9 rearranged MOLM13 by loss-of-function KO and gain-of function rescue, as well as carried out genome wide chromatin and transcriptomic analysis to intterrogate the role of HOTTIP in control of AML specific posterior HOXA chromatin domain. We found that knock-out of HOTTIP lncRNA led to a loss of active chromatin structure and invasion of repressive H3K27me3 mark over the posterior HOXA domain. HOTTIP KO attenuated progression of AML in the transplanted AML mouse model resembling the effect of CBS7/9 boundary disruption, while transcriptional activation of HOTTIP lncRNA in the CBS7/9 boundary-disrupted AML cells restored HOXA locus chromatin signature and gene expression as well as reversed the CBS7/9 -mediated anti-leukemic effects. To further determine the role of HOTTIP lncRNA in regulating HSC function and leukemogenesis, we generated transgenic mice that expresses Hottip lncRNA under the control of the hematopoietic specific Vav1 enhancer and promoter. The Hottip transgenic (Tg) mice exhibited increased WBC and neutrophil counts and developed splenomegaly indicating that enforced expression of Hottip lncRNA resulted in perturbation of hematopoiesis. Furthermore, overexpression of Hottip lncRNA in mice bone marrow hematopoietic compartment strongly perturbed hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSC/HPC) function by altering self-renewal and differentiation property of HSC/HPCs through affecting homeotic gene associated oncogenic transcription program. Approximately 20% of Hottip lncRNA transgenic mice developed abnormal hematopoietic phenotypes resembling AML-like disease. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis indicated that overexpression of Hottip enhanced promoter chromatin accessibility and stimulates transcription of genes and pathways involved in HSC function and leukemogenesis, including WNT signaling, hematopoietic cell lineage, cell cycle, Hoxa9, Hoxa13, and Meis1, Runx1 , and Twist1 genes. Thus, Hottip lncRNA overexpression acts as an oncogenic event to promote HSC self-renewal and HPC proliferation by reprograming leukemic associated chromatin signature and transcription programs.
