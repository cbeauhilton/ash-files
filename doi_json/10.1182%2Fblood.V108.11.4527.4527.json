    "abstract_text": "Novel in vitro methods for screening of antibody libraries against disease-related antigens have led to the development of powerful protein-based biotherapeutics. Ribosome display represents an emerging and innovative in vitro technology for the rapid isolation and evolution of high-affinity peptides or proteins. Eukaryotic ternary ribosome complexes can be used to display human single chain antibodies (scFvs) in order to isolate specific binding reagents. Here we present the isolation of human scFv against the validated immunotherapeutic target antigen CD22 from a leukaemia patient-derived human scFv library using ribosome display technology. The ribosome-displayed scFv were enriched against the human CD22 conjugated to magnetic beads. Isolated constructs were further affinity-matured and specific target recognition was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance and validated using in vitro cell assays."
