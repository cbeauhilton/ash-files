B cell-chronic lymphocyte leukemia (B-CLL) is characterized by an accumulation of long-lived B-lineage cells with the distinctive phenotype: CD19hi, CD5+, CD23+, IgMlo, which are refractory to apoptosis and have undergone cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. The signaling events that control the development of B-CLL are not well defined. To address this, we generated a novel cellular system in which the spontaneous generation of B-CLL-like cells is achieved by stably expressing a plasmid-encoding dominant negative PKC\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1-KR) in mouse FL-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and then culturing these cells in a B cell generation system. The resultant cells bear hallmark characteristics of human B-CLL cells at the level of: (i) phenotype - CD19hi CD5+ CD23+ IgMlo; (ii) cell cycle phase - halted in G0/G1, and; (iii) resistance to apoptosis. Therefore, this system provides us with a unique opportunity to investigate the signaling events that control the initiation of B-CLL. In addition, we isolated a mouse B-CLL (mB-CLL) cell line during long-term culture of PKC\u03b1-KR-HPCs, which proliferates in the absence of growth factors or stroma, thus allowing us to investigate the signaling mechanisms that may be important for the expansion of B-CLL. In an effort to identify the key signaling pathways that are responsible for maintaining survival of B-CLL cells, we treated MIEV (vector control)-, PKC\u03b1-KR-HPCs and mB-CLL cells with pharmacological inhibitors against ERK-MAPK- and PI3K-mediated pathways, as these pathways have been implicated in mediating the survival of human B-CLL cells. We assessed the proportion of cells that were induced to undergo apoptosis (Annexin V binding) relative to control (DMSO-treated) cells. We found that treatment of MIEV- and PKC\u03b1-KR-HPCs with PI3K inhibitors (LY294002/ wortmannin: 1\u201350 \u03bcM) induced a significant increase in apoptosis compared with the control cells (MIEV: 4.7\u00b10.14; PKC\u03b1-KR: 6.8\u00b11.18 at 30 \u03bcM LY294002), while the level of apoptosis in these cells was unaffected upon treatment with MEK inhibitors (PD98059/U0126: 1\u201320 \u03bcM) compared with controls (MIEV: 0.9\u00b10.1; PKC\u03b1-KR: 0.7\u00b10.01 at 10 \u03bcM U0126). Conversely, treatment of mB-CLL cells with MEK1 inhibitors induced an increase in apoptosis compared with the control cells (7.7\u00b14.21 at 10 \u03bcM U0126), while the level of apoptosis in these cells was unaffected upon treatment with PI3K inhibitors (1.6\u00b10.84 at 30 \u03bcM LY294002). Our results suggest that the signaling pathways responsible for maintaining cell survival are differentially-regulated during the initiation vs. expansion phases of B-CLL. Additional studies of the phosphorylation/ activation status of ERK1/ERK2 in MIEV-, PKC\u03b1-KR-HPCs and mB-CLL cells revealed that while ERK1/ERK2 are unphosphorylated/ inactive in MIEV-HPCs, ERK1 only is constitutively phosphorylated in PKC\u03b1-KR-HPCs, while mB-CLL cells contain constitutively phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2. The differential phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 may, at least in part, explain the differential regulation of survival in quiescent and proliferating B-CLL cells. Indeed, the activation of ERK-MAPK can occur in a PI3K-dependent or -independent fashion, depending on the cell type. Collectively, these studies suggest that PI3K- and ERK-MAPK signaling pathways are differentially-regulated to induce survival during the progression of B-CLL cells.",
