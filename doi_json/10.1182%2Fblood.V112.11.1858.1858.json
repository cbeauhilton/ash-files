    "abstract_text": "Background: Under conditions of iron overload, ascorbic acid is oxidised at an increased rate leading to a risk of vitamin C deficiency. With deferoxamine (DFO) standard therapy, vitamin C is usually given at a dose of 2\u20133mg/kg on the days of DFO infusion as this increases iron excretion by up to 30%. With deferarisox (DFX) chelation treatment, although supplementation is permitted, there is currently no information about the effects of vitamin C supplementation on iron excretion and it is often left to patients or their clinician\u2019s discretion as to whether supplementation is given. With long-term treatment, in the absence of supplementation there is a potential risk that vitamin C deficiency will develop and this could influence response to treatment. Patients and Methods : We have measured fasting plasma vitamin C in 41 patients who have been on long term deferasirox treatment for transfusional iron overload for between 1.5 and 5 years. 32 of these patients had received no supplementation and 9 patients had received 2\u20133 mg/kg/ day of supplementation. We have examined whether trends in serum ferritin, myocardial T2* and liver iron, during the final year of observation, relate to plasma levels of vitamin C. Results: Fasting plasma Vitamin C was significantly lower in the 41 patients (mean=30.3\u03bcmol/l, SD=20.8) than healthy control patients (mean=60.29\u03bcmol/l SD=12.6) (P36\u03bcmol/l) (r=0.88, p<0.0001). Conclusions: We conclude that with long-term deferasirox therapy without vitamin C supplementation, there is a significant risk of vitamin C deficiency with a potential for clinical scurvy. The risk of ascorbate deficiency is further increased at higher levels of body iron loading. These findings suggest that vitamin C supplementation (2\u20133mg/kg/day) should be recommended as standard for patients on long-term chelation therapy with deferasirox. It would also be of value to determine whether long term-response was improved by ascorbate supplementation."
