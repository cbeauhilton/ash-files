    "abstract_text": "Background: Increasing evidence indicates that the minimal residual disease in childhood precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) can predict the clinical outcome of the patients. With the combination of multicolor flow cytometry and B-cell receptor gene rearrangement or gene translocation analysis, the majority of minimal residual disease can be detected at the 10 \u22125 level. However, these methods may suffer from high cost and complexity and result in false negatives due to antigen shift or lack of genetic markers. Aberrant DNA hypermethylation in CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes is a hallmark of many human malignancies including B-ALL. Since the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is a component of replisome at the DNA replication fork, the methylation in cytosine is precisely duplicated in each cell cycle. Thus the DNA methylation status is maintained and can be detected in the minimal residual leukemic cells if the original clone has DNA methylation markers. Methods: We developed a new method for detection of minimal residual disease in B-ALL patients using a specific DNA methylation marker in the promoter region of the tumor suppressor gene DLC-1 (deleted in liver cancer -1). The quantitative real-time methylation specific PCR (qMSP) was utilized as a primary detection method and it was validated via combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA). The qMSP uses two specifically designed amplification primers which are complementary only for bisulfite-treated methylated DNA sequences and an additional fluorogenic probe specificlly hybridizing methylated target amplicons. Results: By using highly sensitive qMSP assay, we demonstrated that DNA methylation of the DLC-1 gene promoter occurred in 15 out of 20 (75 %) of B-ALL patient bone marrow aspirate specimens and 2 (NALM-6 and MN60) out of 3 B-ALL cell lines. DLC-1 methylation was detected in multiple sequential specimens (up to 6 time points) from 3 childhood B-ALL patients and is comparable with morphologic, flow cytometry and B-cell receptor gene rearrangement (in 5 specimens) assessment. In addition, DLC-1 methylation in different types of specimens collected at the same time point including frozen bone marrow aspirate, unstained bone marrow aspirate slides, fresh peripheral blood, and unstained peripheral blood smear showed complete consistency. Finally, the analytic sensitivity of qMSP was determined by a series of dilution of tumor cell DNA (MN60) in normal human genomic DNA. Ten ng of tumor DNA can be detected in 1 \u03bcg of normal DNA. The co-efficient of variation (CV) of the intra- and inter- measurements was about 0.5% and 1.5% by Ct values, respectively. Conclusion: We have developed a novel real-time methylation specific PCR method to detect minimal residual disease in B-ALL patients. The method is sensitive, quantitative, simple and fast, and has the potential to be used for routine clinical minimal residual disease detection in majority of B-ALL patients. The analytic sensitivity and specificity of this method are compatible with flow cytometric and molecular analysis. A study with larger number of B-ALL patient specimens using this novel method is currently underway.",
