    "abstract_text": "Background : Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutations (IDH1m) occur in 7-14% of AML patients (pts) and approximately 3-4% of MDS pts. Olutasidenib is a highly potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of IDH1m with the therapeutic potential to restore normal cellular differentiation. Azacitidine (AZA) has shown synergistic effects with IDHm inhibitors on releasing differentiation block in IDHm leukemia models in vitro . Methods : The Phase 1 study (NCT02719574) assessed the safety, PK/PD, and clinical activity of olutasidenib in patients with IDH1m AML or MDS. Eligibility criteria included: IDH1m AML or MDS [relapsed/refractory (R/R) or treatment na\u00efve (TN) pts not eligible for or refusing standard therapy], adequate liver and renal function. There were no restrictions for concomitant non-anticancer medications. IDH1m variant allele frequency (VAF) and co-mutations were measured at baseline and during treatment. Available safety data are presented for all pts (AML/MDS); efficacy data are presented for AML pts only. Results: As of April 12, 2019, 32 pts had been treated with single agent (SA) olutasidenib and 46 pts with olutasidenib in combination (COMBO) with AZA; median time on treatment was 4.2 mo for SA (range: 10% of pts, including thrombocytopenia (28% vs 33%), febrile neutropenia (22% vs 28%), anemia (22% vs 20%), pneumonia (16% vs 11%), and leukocytosis (13% vs 15%); COMBO-treated pts had more Gr 3/4 neutropenia (6% vs 28%), fatigue (6% vs 15%), and nausea (0% vs 9%). No QTcF prolongation was reported in SA while 3 (7%) pts treated with COMBO reported prolonged QTcF (1 Gr 3). Ten (13%) pts had differentiation syndrome (4 SA; 6 COMBO), which resolved with temporary interruption of olutasidenib and treatment with dexamethasone, hydroxyurea, and/or supportive care. None led to treatment discontinuation. Nineteen (24%) pts died on treatment or within 28 days of the last dose, no deaths were considered treatment-related. For AML pts, clinical responses occurred in 39% SA and 54% COMBO (CR 15% and 23%, respectively; Table 1). CRs were durable (up to >27 mo); disease control (SD >13 mo) was observed in pts without an IWG-defined response. Of the 59 AML pts (23 SA; 36 COMBO) who were transfusion-dependent at baseline, 26 (11 [48%] SA; 15 [42%] COMBO) and 21 (9 [39%] SA; 12 [33%] COMBO) became transfusion-independent (seen in all response categories) during 28 and 56 days on treatment, respectively. For R/R AML pts, median survival was 8.7 mo for SA and 12.1 mo for COMBO; for TN AML pts, median survival was 8.8 mo for SA (n=4) and not reached for COMBO. For R/R and TN AML patients with available pre- and on-treatment samples, IDH1m clearance or significant reduction (VAF <1%) was observed in 10/25 pts (40%) achieving an objective response and in 3/6 pts (50%) with stable disease. Mutation and 2-HG analyses suggest that pts who progressed on olutasidenib had a non-IDH1m-driven mechanism; updated analyses will be presented. Conclusions: SA and COMBO olutasidenib has shown favorable safety and clinical activity in IDH1m R/R AML with a SA ORR of 41% (95% CI: 21, 64) and a COMBO ORR of 46% (27, 67), and durable disease control. Olutasidenib induces deep responses with IDH1 mutation clearance in a subset of treated pts. Phase 2 investigations of SA and COMBO olutasidenib at the RP2D are ongoing in multiple IDH1m AML populations. Additional combinations are also being explored.
