    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1458 Poster Board I-481 Mice lacking C/EBP\u03b1 have reduced granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, and C/EBP\u03b1 plays a role in the maturation of GMP along the granulocyte or monocyte lineages. C/EBP\u03b1 is a member of the bZIP family of transcription factors, dimerizing with itself or other C/EBP proteins via its leucine zipper (LZ) domain to bind palindromic DNA elements (e.g. ATTGCGCAAT, designated \u03b1\u03b1 sites) via the adjacent basic region (BR). AP-1 proteins such as c-Fos and c-Jun represent a distinct bZIP subfamily that heterodimerize amongst themselves to bind AP-1 sites (e.g. TGACTCA, designated JJ sites) to also mediate monocytic differentiation in hematopoietic cell lines or transduced marrow cells. In addition, we previously demonstrated that C/EBP\u03b1 or C/EBP\u03b2 can zipper with c-Jun, JunB, or c-Fos (Cai et al 2008). To accomplish this we employed hybrid proteins in which, for example, the c-Jun LZ was swapped in place of the C/EBP\u03b1 LZ and binding to a C/EBP site was then assessed after expression in 293T cells. We also provided data suggesting that C/EBP\u03b1:c-Jun heterodimers bind preferentially to hybrid \u03b1J sites (e.g. TGACGCAAT). To accomplish this we forced heterodimerization by replacing the LZ in C/EBP\u03b1 with an acidic zipper containing multiple glutamic acid residues (LZE) and replaced the LZ in c-Jun with a basic zipper containing multiple lysines (LZK). We have now extended these initial findings in two ways. First, we demonstrate that the intact proteins, not only those containing artificial acid or basic leucine zippers, maintain binding site specificity. In particular, when expressed in 293T cells or when generated by coupled in vitro transcription/translation, C/EBP\u03b1 alone preferentially binds an \u03b1\u03b1 site whereas C/EBP\u03b1 co-expressed with c-Jun prefers the \u03b1J site. Neither C/EBP\u03b1 alone nor C/EBP\u03b1:c-Jun bound a JJ site. Consistent with the weak affinity of C/EBP\u03b1 for c-Jun, formation of sufficient C/EBP\u03b1:c-Jun heterodimers to allow detection of preferential binding to the \u03b1J site required a 4:1 c-Jun:C/EBP\u03b1 ratio, with input proteins normalized via a shared N-terminal myc tag. Super-shift assays confirmed that a single gel shift band contains both proteins under these conditions. Co-expression of c-Jun with c-Fos yielded complexes that bound JJ sites, but interestingly c-Jun:c-Fos bound \u03b1J sites with even greater affinity. Second, we have used biotinylated \u03b1\u03b1 and \u03b1J oligonucleotides to demonstrate the presence of both endogenous C/EBP\u03b1:C/EBP\u03b1 and C/EBP\u03b1:c-Jun complexes in myeloid cell lines. When 32Dcl3 cells are placed in G-CSF for 24 hrs to stimulate granulopoiesis, Western blotting indicates that C/EBP\u03b1 levels are induced while c-Jun levels remain constant, and binding of C/EBP\u03b1 to the \u03b1\u03b1 biotin-oligo increases, likely reflecting the presence of endogenous C:EBP\u03b1 homodimers, as no interaction of c-Jun with the \u03b1\u03b1 probe was detected. Both endogenous C/EBP\u03b1 and c-Jun interact the \u03b1J biotin-oligo, suggesting binding by an endogenous C/EBP\u03b1:c-Jun complex, and binding of each of these proteins to this probe also increases upon G-CSF induction of C/EBP\u03b1. Further support for the presence of an endogenous C/EBP\u03b1:c-Jun complex comes from the observation that interaction of C/EBP\u03b1 with the \u03b1J oligo is several-fold stronger than with the \u03b1\u03b1 oligo, before or after G-CSF addition, whereas gel shift assay results described above indicate that C/EBP\u03b1 homodimers prefer the \u03b1\u03b1 probe. We previously found that C/EBP\u03b1LZK:C/EBP\u03b1LZE homodimers favor granulopoiesis whereas C/EBP\u03b1LZK:c-JunLZE heterodimers favor monopoiesis of marrow progenitors (Cai et al 2008). In summary, new data indicate that when c-Jun is present in excess, co-expressed C/EBP\u03b1 and c-Jun preferentially binds hybrid \u03b1J site, and C/EBP\u03b1:c-Jun complexes are detected endogenously in myeloid cells. These new findings provide biochemical support for the idea that C/EBP\u03b1:AP-1 heterodimers bind novel DNA elements to help mediate monopoiesis, with C/EBP\u03b1:C/EBP\u03b1 homodimers potentially favoring granulopoiesis. Our future focus will be to further define the cellular levels of endogenous C/EBP, AP-1, and C/EBP:AP-1 complexes in immature and mature monocytic and granulocytic cells and to elucidate the spectrum of genes these complexes bind and regulate during myelopoiesis.
