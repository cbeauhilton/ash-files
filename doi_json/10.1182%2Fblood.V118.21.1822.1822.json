    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1822 INTRODUCTION. MicroRNAs are an abundant class of small non-protein-coding RNAs that function as negative gene regulators in diverse biological processes including cancer by affecting the stability and translation of mRNAs. METHODS. We determined expression of 559 miRNAs by miChip (Exiqon LNA Array probes V9.2) in CD138-purified myeloma cells from previously untreated patients (n=69), normal bone marrow plasma cells of healthy donors (pooled to n=3), and human myeloma cell lines (n=20). For normalization, an invariant-based method was applied. Gene expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix U133 2.0 DNA-microarrays. RESULTS. We found 29 miRNAs to be significantly up- and 35 down-regulated in myeloma cells vs. normal bone marrow plasma cells, respectively. Expression of 18 miRNAs was simultaneously significantly (P<.01) associated with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), and allowed the delineation of prognostic groups. Of these, miRNAs miR-659 (located at 22q12.1) was significantly lower expressed in myeloma cells compared to normal bone marrow plasma cells. For this miRNA, low expression delineates a group with inferior EFS (median 19.7 months vs. not reached, P< .001) and OS (median 52.9 months vs. not reached, P< .001). This group shows a significantly higher gene expression based proliferation index. In contrast, high miR-590 expression (located at 7q11.23) delineates a group with inferior EFS (median 12.4 vs. 36 months, P <0.001) and OS (median 29.4 months vs. not reached, P< .001). By using Goeman's global test, a significant association of the predicted target gene signatures with survival could be found for both, EFS (miR-590-5p, P <.001; miR-659, P <.001) and OS ( P =.009; P =.002). CONCLUSION. In conclusion, we demonstrate the prognostic relevance of miRNome profiling in multiple myeloma. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
