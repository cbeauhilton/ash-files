    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4284 While adoptive T cell therapy is a promising treatment modality for cancer, the optimal approach to generate T cell grafts ex vivo is currently unknown. CD4 + T cells help generate effective immune responses by sustaining CD8 + T cell proliferation, preventing exhaustion, and establishing long-lived functional memory. Incorporation of CD4 + T cell help to expand CD8 + T cells may provide a novel strategy to generate CTL grafts for adoptive therapy. In mouse models, common \u03b3-chain receptor cytokines and CD40/CD40L can mediate CD4 + T cell help. However, CD4 + T cell help in humans has yet to be fully defined. We therefore developed an in vitro model for human CD4 + T cell help, which utilizes a novel artificial APC, aAPC/mOKT3. K562-based aAPC/mOKT3 expresses a membranous form of anti-CD3 mAb, CD54, CD58, CD80, and CD83 and stimulates CD3 + T cells regardless of HLA haplotype or antigen specificity. Using aAPC/mOKT3, we stimulated CD8 + T cells in the presence or absence of CD4 + T cells and found that CD8 + T cells expanded better when coincubated with CD4 + T cells, suggesting the presence of CD4 + T cell help. Coculture experiments using transwell plates suggested that the observed CD4 + T cell help of CD8 + T cell expansion involved both soluble factors and cell-cell contact. To identify molecules mediating the observed CD4 + T cell help, supernatants of CD4 + /CD8 + T cell mixed and separate cultures were measured for a panel of soluble factors. IL-2 and IL-21 were detected at lower levels in mixed cultures, consistent with more consumption or less production of these cytokines. Blockade of either IL-2 or IL-21 in CD4 + /CD8 + T cell mixed cultures resulted in a reduction of CD8 + T cell expansion, indicating that, for both cytokines, more consumption rather than less production occurred and that IL-2 and IL-21 may serve as mediators of CD4 + T cell help. However, the addition of IL-21 to CD8 + T cells stimulated with aAPC/mOKT3 in the presence of IL-2 did not improve CD8 + T cell expansion, suggesting that IL-2 plus IL-21 cannot solely replace CD4 + T cell help. We found that the presence of CD4 + T cells upregulated the expression of IL-21R on CD8 + T cells. When we introduced IL-21R on CD8 + T cells and stimulated with aAPC/mOKT3 in the presence of IL-2 and IL-21, CD8 + T cell proliferation was restored. These results suggest that CD4 + T cells help CD8 + T cells proliferate ex vivo by secreting both IL-2/IL-21 and upregulating IL-21R. When peripheral CD3 + T cells from normal donors were stimulated with aAPC/mOKT3, the number of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells increased. However, in contrast to other pan T cell expansion systems, aAPC/mOKT3 preferentially expanded CD8 + T cells. No obvious skewing in the V\u03b2 usage of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations was revealed by TCR V\u03b2 repertoire analysis, supporting \u201cunbiased\u201d T cell expansion by aAPC/mOKT3. Moreover, HLA-restricted antigen-specific CD8 + CTL with high functional avidity could be generated from CD3 + T cells initially expanded for 4 weeks using aAPC/mOKT3. Using aAPC/mOKT3, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were successfully expanded without adding soluble mAb or allogeneic feeder cells. As in peripheral T cell cultures, CD8 + T cells predominantly expanded in all cultures, including those that initially contained a minimal percentage of CD8 + T cells. Importantly, Foxp3 + Treg cells did not proliferate. Expanded T cells highly expressed CD27 and CD28, which are associated with T cell survival and persistence in vivo . They also secreted high levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2, lower amounts of IL-4, and no IL-10. These results demonstrate that the aAPC/mOKT3-based system can expand functional CD8 + TIL in the presence of autologous CD4 + T cells. In conclusion, we have determined that CD4 + T cell-dependent CD8 + T cell expansion required both soluble factors secreted by and cell contact with CD4 + T cells. Among the soluble factors secreted by CD4 + T cells, IL-2 and IL-21 were necessary. Furthermore, upregulation of IL-21R on CD8 + T cells by CD4 + T cells was critical for an optimized response to IL-21. Thus, in humans, CD4 + T cells help CD8 + T cells proliferate by secreting IL-2/IL-21 and upregulating IL-21R. Our aAPC enabled expansion of CD8 + TIL in the presence of CD4 + T cell help without using soluble mAb or allogeneic feeder cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate the indispensable role of CD4 + T cell help on expanding CD8 + T cells and suggest a novel strategy to generate anti-tumor T cells ex vivo for adoptive therapy.
