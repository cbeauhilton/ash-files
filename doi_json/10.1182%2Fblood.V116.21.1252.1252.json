    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1252 We and others have recently established that T cell reactivity with non-self HLA (HLA alloreactivity) arises not only from naive T cells but also from the antigen-experienced T cell pool, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cells. Virus-specific T cells could therefore mediate graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) if infused into partially HLA mismatched recipients. We reviewed our clinical experience with adoptive transfer of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant donor-derived virus-specific T cell lines in 153 recipients who received donor-derived EBV-specific CTLs (N=114), bivirus CTLs specific for adenovirus and EBV (n=14), and trivirus CTLs specific for CMV, adenovirus and EBV (n=25). Seventy three donor-recipient pairs were partially HLA-mismatched, with the degree of HLA mismatching varying from one allele to a full haplotype. De novo GvHD did not develop after infusion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and the incidence of GvHD reactivation was 6.5% and not significantly different between recipients of HLA matched or mismatched CTL. Thus, virus-specific CTL did not mediate GvHD, even in recipients of partially matched CTL. Next we analyzed the HLA alloreactivity of four donor-infused bivirus-specific T cell lines, using activated T cells, that are known to lack CMV and EBV antigen expression, as antigen presenting cells (TAPC). We used a panel of 44 TAPC covering the most frequent HLA class I and II alleles. The CTL lines were labeled with CFSE and stimulated with TAPC for 6 hours, after which production of TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3/IL-2 by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the CFSE-positive fraction was analyzed by flow cytometry. All CTLs responded to a number of TAPC, with some APC being recognized strongly. The majority elicited only weak or no response from the CTLs. We then assessed whether the CTLs recognized TAPC expressing the recipient's HLA alleles. We found moderate reactivity of the CTL with 1\u20135 TAPC expressing recipient HLA alleles. Taken together, our data indicate that reactivity of virus-specific CTLs with hematopoietic APC does not correlate with the risk of developing GvHD, and that virus-specific CTL can safely be infused into HLA class I and/or II mismatched recipients.
