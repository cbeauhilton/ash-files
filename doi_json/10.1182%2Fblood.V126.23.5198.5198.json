    "abstract_text": "Myelofibrosis (MF) is the most symptomatic of the myeloproliferative neoplasms and is associated with the greatest symptom burden and poorest prognosis. Patient-reported outcomes is an effective way to identify patients' needs and risks/benefits of MF treatment. We aimed to study quality of life (QoL) and symptom burden in MF patients in a real-world setting. 44 MF patients - 27 primary MF, 8 post-essential thrombocytopenia, 9 post-polycythemia vera - were enrolled in the multicenter real-world QoL study. Mean age - 60.8\u00b113.3; male/female - 14/30. All the patients received the best available treatment (BAT, n=28) or novel treatment modality ruxolitinib (n=16) for at least 6 months (range 6-160 mths). A high proportion of patients (80%) had intermediate to high prognostic risk scores according to International Prognostic Scoring System. All the patients completed the QoL questionnaire SF-36, symptom assessment questionnaire CSP-MF and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) tool. Integral QoL Index (IQoLI) in MF patients was calculated on the basis of SF-36 and QoL impairment grade was assessed in comparing with QoL population norms (PN). Comparison t-test for independent samples or Mann-Whitney test was applied. The heterogeneity of MF patients population in terms of QoL impairment was shown: 55% of patients had mild QoL impairment (IQoLI\u226425% from PN), 7% - moderate (IQoLI\u226425-50% from PN), 38% - severe or critical QoL impairment (IQoLI\u226450% from PN). Patients receiving BAT exhibited more pronounced QoL impairment as compared to patients receiving ruxolitinib (p<0.05); they had worse physical functioning, general health, vitality, social functioning, and mental health (p<0.05). All the patients experienced multiple symptoms; the most severe symptoms were fatigue, inactivity and pain in bones/muscles. The symptoms were more expressed in patients on BAT as compared to patients on ruxolitinib (p<0.005). Patient's impression of health changes was better in patients treated with ruxolitinib: the mean PGIC score was higher in patients on BAT on ruxolitinib - 4.4 vs 2.3 (p=0.001). Quality of life and perceived change in health condition are better and symptom severity is less in MF patients on ruxolitinib therapy than those on BAT. Results of this real-world study demonstrate benefits of ruxolitinib therapy from patient perspective. Patient-reported outcomes are of help to better identify the needs of MF patients.
