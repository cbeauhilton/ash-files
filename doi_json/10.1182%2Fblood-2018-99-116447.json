    "abstract_text": "Background and Objective : There is an increasing interest about the role of amino acid degrading enzymes in cancer immunotherapy.In multiple myeloma (MM) disease progression depends on the ability of malignant plasma cells (PC) to subvert the local microenvironment and reshape host immunity to support tumor growth. Our previous work showed that i) MM cells have metabolic plasticity due to availability of external nutrients; ii) aminoacid shortage due to the tryptohan (trp) degrading enzyme IDO-1 was associated to clinical MM progression. Thus, we tested bio-energetic changes in MM upon trp deprivation. Experimental design : We evaluated the trascriptome changes in the adaptive response in four human MM cell lines (MM1.s, H929, U266, OPM2), chosen for their cytogenetic alterations and previously characterized for differential expression of CD38 and c-myc and primary BM samples of MGUS and MM to trp shortage. The pathway was confirmed looked at the expression levels of key metabolic genes in a large series of highly purified BM PC samples from healthy donors (4N), 129 MM, 24 primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL), 12 secondary PCL (sPCL) cases from a proprietary dataset (GSE66293). Results Trp deprivation induced an adaptive response through increased expression, time and dose-dependent, of ATF4-ASNS-CHOP-GADD34, part of GCN2 signaling, associated to increased expression of p62 (the main autophagic receptor in MM) followed by autophagy flux induction, as shown by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence evaluations. In MM cell lines, trp deprivation altered the cellular dependence on mitochondrial ATP generation via oxidative phosphorylation, inducing in vitro increase of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and intracellular lactate and NAD/NADH with down-regulation of surface expression of the NAD-ase CD38. Similarly, short-term trp deprivation in CD138+ plasma cells isolated by magnetic sorting from MM patients, downregulated surface expression of CD38 and intra-cellular amount of c-myc, as detected by flow cytometry. This phenomenon was associated to increased isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH-1), enolase-1 (ENO-1), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK-1), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD), suggesting that branched chain amino acids with tolerogenic meaning like trp are used in MM to sustain NADH availability and energy production. In the GSE66293 MM progression was associated to increased expression of ENO-1, PGK-1, and DLD, suggesting that changes in transcription of genes involved in bioenergetics could be clinically relevant. Conclusion Overall, our study reveals that trp deprivation promotes an adaptive response of MM offering new putative targets in the bio-energetic pathway for synthetic lethality.
