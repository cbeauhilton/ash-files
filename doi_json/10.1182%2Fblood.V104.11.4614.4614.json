    "abstract_text": "TRAIL-R1 and -R2 signaling induces apoptosis via a pathway that activates caspase 8. The proteosome inhibitor bortezomib may act via several pathways. Agonistic antibodies to TRAIL-R1 and -R2 and bortezomib are in clinical trials in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. To develop rational combinations for future clinical studies, we investigated the actions of these agents on non-Hodgkin s lymphoma (NHL) cell lines. The t(14;18)+, EBV- NHL cell lines DoHH2 and WSU-FSCCL were treated with agonistic monoclonal antibodies to TRAIL-R1 (HGS-ETR1) and -R2 (HGS-ETR2) (Human Genome Sciences, Rockville, MD) and/or bortezomib. While HGS-ETR 1 and HGS-ETR 2 are effective inducers of apoptosis in FSCCL, DoHH2, which expresses dim TRAIL-R1 (DR4, HGS-ETR1 target) and TRAIL-R2 (DR5, HGS-ETR2 target), shows minimal growth inhibition or apoptosis induction by HGS-ETR1 or HGS-ETR2. Bortezomib has modest effects on DoHH2 cells in growth inhibition and apoptosis assays. HGS-ETR1 and HGS-ETR2 induction of apoptosis in WSU-FSCCL is efficiently blocked by the caspase inhibitor ZVAD. In contrast, bortezomib effects are not blocked by ZVAD, indicating an independent mechanism of action. To determine if these separate pathways would provide enhanced combination activity, DoHH2 cells were pre-treated with bortezomib for 30 min, followed by incubation with HGS-ETR1 or HGS-ETR2. This led to supra-additive induction of apoptosis (annexin V staining). We conclude that bortezomib sensitizes DoHH2 cells to the action of HGS-ETR1 and HGS-ETR2. Further, bortezomib induces apoptosis in DoHH2 cells by an independent mechanism, and the combination of TRAIL-receptor signaling and bortezomib may be a useful combination to explore.",
