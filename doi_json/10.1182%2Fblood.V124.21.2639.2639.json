    "abstract_text": "Background: Bortezomib is an antineoplastic agent that acts through protease inhibition. Since, its approval in 2003 by U.S. Food and Drug administration, it has been used religiously for multiple myeloma. There is no current population based study that assesses the survival benefit in multiple myeloma from bortezomib. We conducted a population based study to evaluate the relative survival rates in multiple myeloma patients in pre and post-Bortezomib era in the United States. Methods: We analyzed the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registry database to compare five-year relative survival rates (RS) among multiple myeloma patients. The study arms were categorized by gender (male and female), race (Caucasians and African-Americans) and age (20-59, \u226560 years). The RS were compared between pre-bortezomib era (1991-2002) and post-bortezomib era (2004-2011). The survival rate accompanied standard errors and the statistical significance was defined as p value <0.05. Results: The database comprised of 57,328 patients. The RS have improved significantly during post-bortezomib era in all cohorts under consideration. There was no significant difference in survival rate between male and female and between the African American and Caucasian. However, the relative survival was much better with the young adult (20-59 years) as compared to adult \u226560 years. The table detailing the relative survival is given below. Conclusion: The Primary treatment protocols for Multiple Myeloma have changed dramatically since the approval of Bortezomib in 2003. Other novel agents introduced in the last decade include thalidomide, Lenalidomide and liposomal doxorubicin that are used in conjunction with Bortezomib. Survival trends continue to improve and we believe this modest improvement in survival rate is mainly due to the introduction of Bortezomib and other novel agents. The next challenge is to find new drugs which would prevent relapses and further prolong survival. Abstract 2639. Table.  Study arm . Subclass of cohorts . Pre-bortezomib era (1991-2002) .
