    "abstract_text": "Hemophilia is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII (FVIII)(hemophilia A, HA) or factor IX (FIX)(hemophilia B, HB). While early clinical trials of AAV delivery of FIX for HB have demonstrated stable FIX expression for >8 years, an ongoing clinical trial of AAV-FVIII delivery for HA achieved high levels of transgene expression that unexpectedly declined after 1 year. Here we describe preclinical studies of AAV-canine FVIII (cFVIII) delivery in nine HA dogs with sustained FVIII expression for the duration of the study, as long as 10 years. FVIII was delivered using two delivery approaches: (1) co-administration of two AAV vectors encoding separate cFVIII heavy and light chains driven by the thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) promoter (Two chain approach)(TC) (n=5) at two AAV doses (2.5 x 10 13 vg/kg; F24, Woodstock, J60) and (1.2 x 10 13 vg/kg; Linus, H19) or (2) delivery of cFVIII as a single chain driven by the human alpha-1 anti-trypsin (hAAT) promoter (Single chain approach)(SC)(n=4) at two AAV doses (4 x 10 13 vg/kg; M50, M06) and (2 x 10 13 vg/kg; M66, L51) (Sabatino 2011). We demonstrated that both strategies were efficacious; preventing >95% of spontaneous bleeding episodes without toxicity. We now report the long-term follow-up of between 2.2 and 10.1 years for these treated dogs. Dose-dependent cFVIII:C (Coatest SP4 FVIII) was observed. At the final time point, the cFVIII:C was 2.7% (F24), 7.1% (Woodstock), 4.5% (J60), 11.3% (Linus) and 2.5% (H19) for TC dogs. For the SC dogs, the cFVIII:C was 9.4% (M06), 10.3% (M50), 1.9% (L51) and 3.7% (M66). Stable FVIII expression was maintained for seven of the dogs over the course of the study. Two dogs (Linus, M50) had a gradual increase in FVIII:C that began about three years after vector administration and continued for an additional seven years (Linus) and four years (M50), until the termination of the study. Liver function tests, serum alpha-fetoprotein concentrations, fibrinogen levels as well as liver pathology did not suggest altered liver function or tumor development in Linus and M50 compared to the other dogs. Clinically, there was no evidence of malignancy and no tumors were detected at the time of necropsy in any dog. One of the safety concerns for AAV-mediated gene therapy approaches is the potential for AAV integration events to be genotoxic and lead to tumorigenesis. While recombinant AAV primarily remains as an episome, integration events have been observed in mouse models and hepatocellular carcinoma has been observed after neonatal delivery of AAV vectors. In addition, the increase in FVIII expression in Linus and M50 prompted us to investigate integration and clonal expansion as a potential mechanism for these observations. Vector copy number (VCN) analysis was performed on liver samples (5-29 per dog, n=8 dogs) by Q-PCR and detected DNA copy numbers between 0.0 and 7.8 per diploid genome (Fig 1A). We performed integration target site analysis on liver samples (n=3/dog) from six of the AAV-treated HA dogs and na\u00efve HA dogs (n=2) by ligation-mediated PCR, Ilumina paired-end sequencing and analysis using the custom software pipeline, AAVenger. Analysis of the 20 samples identified >2,000 unique AAV integration events (IE). There was a correlation between the DNA copy number and the number of integration events detected. Clonal abundances were estimated by counting the unique genome breaks associated with integration positions, which showed that the maximum clonal abundance ranged from 1 to 138. The integration events were distributed across the canine genome. Clonal expansions were observed with integration near genes previously associated with growth control and transformation in humans (Fig 1B) with the most abundant clones located in DLEU2L (Linus), PEBP4 (J60) and EGR3 (M50). Integration events in EGR3, EGR2, CCND1, LTO1 and ZNF365 were detected in multiple dogs. Validation of integration sites in the most abundant clones was performed using targeted PCR to isolate junction fragments followed by Sanger sequencing. While AAV integration and clonal expansion was observed, the dogs had no evidence for tumorigenesis and it is not clear if the increase in FVIII expression is associated with the clonal expansions detected. Overall, these studies demonstrate long-term sustained FVIII expression for up to 10 years with clonal expansion, but without clinical adverse events after AAV-mediated gene therapy for hemophilia.
