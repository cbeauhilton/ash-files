    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4318 New oral anticoagulants have generated promising data on the prophylaxis of systemic and non-systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and treatment of acute venous thromboembolism and prolonged prophylaxis of recurrent events. For patients on chronic treatment with vitamin-K antagonists (VKA) we analysed the motivation and willingness to change the anticoagulation from VKA to new oral anticoagulants. Patients (n=110) on stable treatment with VKA for at least 3 months (indication for anticoagulation: atrial fibrillation or VTE) completed a validated personality inventory (Freiburger Perso\u0308nlichkeitsinventar FPI-R), and a self-developed questionnaire on general attitudes regarding anticoagulant therapy (Q1). Patients were divided in two groups according to the reply to the question weather they were willing to switch to a new oral anticoagulant. Out of these sets of questions 7 questions were identified by means of a logistic regression analysis for the willingness to change anticoagulation with VKA to a new oral anticoagulant. The same patients completed this shortened questionnaire (Q2) (n=85) thereafter. Logistic regression analysis defined the 7 items of the FPI and Q1 questionaires as relevant for willingness of patients to change the medication. The probability to change medication was 98% using the 7 questions (Q2) compared to the 2 comlete questionnaires. The items were: extraversion \u2013 introversion scale on the FPI-R consisting of 14 questions, and from Q1: hope for a better quality of life with a new anticoagulant, no scepticism for new drugs, wish of a lack of routine monitoring for dose adjustment, relevance of the practitioners opinion, thoughts in the past of alternatives for anticoagulation, and difficulty to adjust the prothrombin time. Using Q2 85% of patients confirmed to be willing to change the anticoagulant drug compared to Q1 (chi square test p<0.0001). Seven questions were identified and confirmed to identify patients for their willingness to change anticoagulation from VKA to a new oral anticoagulant.
