    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem cells reside in the bone marrow within specialized microenvironments designated the stem cell niche. The remarkable advances over the past decade have dramatically enhanced our perception of the niche; yet, the operative mechanisms after radioablation in preparation for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) remain poorly understood. We have previously described a profound remodeling of the bone marrow architecture after total body irradiation (TBI). This remodeling, comprised of enlarged, proliferating marrow osteoblasts and megakaryocyte migration from the central marrow space to the endosteal surface, is essential for efficient engraftment of donor cells after BMT; hence, marrow remodeling seems to represent an adaptation of the endosteal niche. To investigate whether hematopoietic cells regulate these changes, we sought to deplete all hematopoietic cells prior to TBI. We generated mice expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) in all CD45-derived cells using the Cre/loxP model. To validate this strategy, we first crossed CD45Cre mice, where cre is expressed under the control of the endogenous promoter, with Z/RED mice which will then irreversibly express red fluorescent protein (RFP) in all cells that were derived from CD45-expressing progenitors. Surprisingly, we identified a population of RFP-expressing cells residing among osteoblasts along the endosteal and trabecular bone surfaces (designated red Bone Lining Cell, red BLC). By immunofluorescence staining, these cells lacked expression of CD45, lineage markers (Gr1, CD11b, F 4/80, CD3, B220, Ter119), and cathepsin K indicating it is not a hematopoietic cell, specifically not an osteal macrophage or osteoclast, but was unequivocally derived from CD45-expressing progenitors. We reproduced this fate map by crossing vav1Cre mice with Z/RED mice, confirming the identification and hematopoietic lineage of the red BLC. When crossed with Col2.3GFP transgenic mice, which express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in mature osteoblasts, red BLCs lacked GFP co-expression indicating it is not a generic osteoblast. Interestingly, after TBI, red BLCs markedly proliferate, but do not enlarge, in the metaphysis and epiphysis, but not in the diaphysis, coincident with the osteoblast proliferation suggesting a possible role in marrow remodeling. To pursue our original hypothesis that hematopoietic cells may regulate marrow remodeling, we treated mice expressing DTR in all CD45-derived cells and their non-expressing littermates (controls) with diphtheria toxin (DT) followed by TBI to induce marrow remodeling without the effect of CD45-derived cells. Marrow remodeling ensued; however, the characteristically enlarged endosteal osteoblasts adopted a strikingly flattened morphology (cell thickness, 8.45\u00b10.31 vs. 3.42\u00b10.11 \u03bcm, P95%), and in separate cohort, MMs using clondronate (>95%). In each cohort, post-TBI marrow remodeling included the expected enlarged endosteal osteoblasts indistinguishable from controls, suggesting that neither Mks nor MMs direct the acquired osteoblast morphology. Collectively, our data indicate that enlarging of endosteal osteoblasts after marrow ablation is critical for donor cell engraftment, possibly due to altered adhesive properties for primitive hematopoietic cells. During post-TBI marrow remodeling, a CD45-derived cell that survives radioablation governs this osteoblast morphology. Our data implicate the red BLC as this key regulatory element. Understanding the red BLC will likely offer new insight into the niche and may lead to novel strategies to enhance HSC engraftment in BMT. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
