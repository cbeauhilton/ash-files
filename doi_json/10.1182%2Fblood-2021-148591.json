    "abstract_text": "Introduction : It has become increasingly apparent that chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cell activation and differentiation level is an important determinant of CART cell fate and response to therapy. In this study, we aimed to 1) measure levels of activation-induced surface death receptors and ligands on CART cells; 2) investigate how CART cell activation could impact their fitness and clinical responses, and 3) identify cell-based targets to modulate CART cell activation, apoptosis, and cytotoxicity to improve anti-tumor activity. Methods: We performed flow cytometric studies on ex-vivo stimulated, clinically annotated CART products of patients with large B cell lymphoma from the pivotal ZUMA-1 clinical trial that led to FDA-approved Axicabtagene ciloleucel (Axi-Cel). We investigated possible correlations of a number of surface death receptors and ligands with T cell differentiation status and post-infusion CART cell expansion, utilizing samples from ZUMA-1 patients who achieved a complete response as a best outcome ('responders') vs patients who achieved stable or progressive disease('non-responders'). CART cell effector functions in vitro were measured, and CART apoptosis was assessed using Annexin V. For in vitro and in vivo functional studies, we used CART19 generated from healthy donors (HD CART19) as indicated in the specific experiment. CRISPR/Cas9 was employed during CART cell production to disrupt specific genes. A xenograft model of lymphoma was used to investigate the in vivo antitumor activity of CART19. Results: Following an ex vivo stimulation of Axi-Cel products with CD19 + target cells, we observed upregulation of death receptors and ligands in CART19 from non-responders, compared to responders. We also observed a possible association between such upregulated surface markers with CART cell differentiation as measured by CCR7 expression. In an extended in vitro co-culture assay, where HD CART19 cells were repeatedly stimulated through the CAR, we found that tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 receptor 2 (TNFR2), unlike other death receptors and ligands, was persistently elevated, suggesting a possible role for TNFR2 in long-term antigen-dependent CART19 dysfunction (Figure 1A). We further found that HD CART19 upregulate TNFR2, but not TNFR1, upon CAR stimulation (Figure 1B). While non-specific TCR activation (CD3 stimulation) of HD CART19 cells protected them from activation-induced apoptosis, antigen-specific activation through the CAR resulted in significant initiation of apoptosis within 2 hours of stimulation (Figure 1C). Having identified a possible association between TNFR2 and CART19 dysfunction, we aimed to study the impact of TNFR2 knockout on HD CART19 functions. Using CRISPR/Cas9 during CART cell manufacturing, we generated TNFR2 k/o HD CART19 cells with a knockout efficiency of around 50%, where the expression levels of TNFR2 in activated CART19 cells were reduced, compared to control CART19 cells (with non-targeting gRNA CRISPR/Cas9, Figure 1D). TNFR2 k/o CART19 cells demonstrated reduced early activation surface markers compared to control CART19, as measured by CD25 and CD69 surface expression (Figure 1E), reduced apoptosis initiation as measured by the Annexin V assay (Figure 1F), and enhanced antigen-specific proliferation and cytotoxicity (Figure 1G). Finally, in an in vivo xenograft model of CD19 + lymphoma, TNFR2 k/o CART19 resulted in enhanced CART cell expansion and anti-tumor activity (Figure 1H). Conclusions: Our results indicate that TNFR2 plays a role in early activation and apoptosis initiation of CART19 following CAR stimulation with CD19 + target cells and present TNFR2 knockout as a strategy to enhance CART19 anti-tumor activity.
