The effects of eltrombopag on the proliferation of solid tumor cell lines and the expression of thrombopoietin receptor ( MPL , TpoR) on patient tumors is of interest given that chemotherapy can cause thrombocytopenia. Materials and methods: Proliferation was measured by Cell Titer Glo assay on 3 ovarian (OVCAR3, OVCAR4, SKOV3), 4 lung (A549, NCI-H226, NCI-H510, NCI-H460) and 3 breast (BT-474, MCF7, HCC1937) cancer cell lines from the ATCC treated with 0.01 \u2013 100 ug/mL eltrombopag. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) for MPL expression was performed on the tumor cell lines and on 40 tumor samples, each from subjects with ovarian, lung or breast cancer. Microarray analysis for MPL mRNA expression was examined from 118 subjects with breast cancer and 29 with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Microarray data was normalized using robust multiarray average (RMA) and relative mRNA expression was determined. To determine expression of TpoR protein, western blot analyses was performed on some of the tumor cell lines. Results: Eltrombopag induced an inhibition of proliferation on all of the ovarian, lung and breast solid tumor cell lines tested. The IC50 ranged from 3.7 to 49.7 ug/mL (see table below). The Cmax of ITP patients treated with 75 mg eltrombopag is 11.4 ug/mL, demonstrating that these concentrations are clinically achievable. There was no enhancement of proliferation at any concentration of eltrombopag, consistent with the very low or undetectable level of MPL expression on samples of tumors from patients with these diseases. MPL was expressed at very low or undetectable levels in these tumor cell lines with the exception of the lung cancer line, NCI-H510. However, western blot analyses showed no detectable TpoR protein expression regardless of the higher levels of MPL mRNA in NCI-H510 cells. Erythropoietin receptor ( EPOR ) mRNA was expressed at low-to-moderate levels, while ERBB2 and IGF1R were expressed at higher levels in these cell lines. Microarray analysis showed undetectable MPL mRNA levels in all 118 samples from patients with breast cancer and 52% of the NSCLC samples, the remaining NSCLC samples expressed low levels of MPL . In contrast, EPOR was expressed in 75\u2013100% of the breast cancer, and NSCLC samples. ERBB2 was expressed in 97\u2013100% of the samples and IGF1R was expressed in 54\u2013100% of the samples. When 40 other tumor samples each from subjects with ovarian, lung and breast cancer were examined by qRT-PCR, MPL mRNA levels were also very low or undetectable. EPOR , ERBB2 , and IGF1R expression levels varied according to tumor type, but were greater than MPL levels. Conclusions: In summary, similar to its effects on leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, all of the nine lung, ovarian, breast or prostate tumor cell lines demonstrated decreased proliferation in response to eltrombopag. The undetectable or very low levels of expression of MPL mRNA in tumors of patients with lung, ovarian, breast or prostate cancer supports the proliferation results.  Cell line . Tumor type .
