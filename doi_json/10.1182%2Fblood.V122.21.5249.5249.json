    "abstract_text": "Introduction In Polycythaemia Vera (PV), the RBC lineage is involved with increased haemoglobin, RBC count and haematocrit. WHO diagnostic criteria for PV are JAK2 V617F mutation and elevated red cell mass (RCM) > 25% of mean normal value. In addition, tests of marrow hypercellularity, blood erythropoietin and colony formation, are minor criteria. However, the diagnostic role of RCM test is still controversial and requires clarification. In this work, PV patients who had both an RCM study and JAK2 V617F mutation test, and routine laboratory tests, are evaluated to check if RCM was essential in the diagnostic work up for PV. Methods Over 2 years, 75 patients with abnormal haematocrit (men \u2265 0.50, women \u2265 0.45) had RCM and JAK2 V617F mutation tests (except JAK2 exon 12 mutation). All subjects consented to the study approved by the ethics committee. RCM was done by Cr-51 RBC radiolabeling method (no prior venesection at least 1 month). Statistical analysis involved descriptive statistics and chi-square test. Results There were 71 males and 4 females, mean age 46 y (range 17-75 y). Increased RCM was found in 41/75 (55%). Positive JAK2 V617F was found in 13/75 patients (17%), who also had RCM above the mean normal predicted value, however, when the WHO RCM criteria were applied, only 7/13 (54%) could be considered as having \u201ctruly\u201d increased RCM. In the patient group with negative JAK2 V617F test, 12/28 (43%) had RCM results as per WHO criteria. There was no statistical association between presence of JAK2 V617F and the RCM values. Conclusion In patients with negative JAK2 V617F but with high clinical suspicion for PV and all other causes of secondary and idiopathic erythrocytosis excluded, an increase in RCM would support the diagnosis of PV (about 10 % PV cases). In patients with JAK2 positive mutation and high haematocrit but RCM below the WHO cut-off level, an increased RCM would still count to confirm the diagnosis as the current standard level seems too stringent.
