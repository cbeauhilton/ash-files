    "abstract_text": "Recent studies on EPO-EPOR systems in non-mammalian vertebrate including frog and teleost fishes demonstrate extramedullary adult erythropoiesis instead of bone marrow. In adult Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), an animal model of hepatic erythropoiesis should give an opportunity for understanding the microenvironment of vascular niche. Therefore, we investigate on erythrocyte development, gene expressions and gene regulations of EPO and EPOR molecules in adult Xenopus liver. In situ hybridization and immunostaining revealed that Xenopus EPOR ( xl EPOR) expressing erythrocyte progenitors, which have low hemoglobin content, were localized among liver sinusoids. The maximum number of xl EPOR expressing cells was observed when peripheral RBC count reached a nadir after hemolytic anemia. Flowcytometric analysis of peripheral blood cells and dispersed liver cells using anti- xl EPOR antibodies also indicate that the xl EPOR + cells in liver were increased as decreasing count of peripheral RBC. After a nadir of RBC count, xl EPOR + immature nucleated erythrocytes were emerged in the circulation. The count of xl EPOR + immature erythrocytes was gradually decreased as increasing count of xl EPOR \u2212 mature erythrocytes. Since mature erythrocytes are still nucleated in Xenopus , we used xl EPOR molecules as erythroid differentiation marker. Meanwhile real time RT-PCR analysis of Xenopus EPO ( xl EPO) mRNA revealed that xl Epo gene expression was significantly induced in anemic liver compared to normal liver. These data suggest that xl EPO- xl EPOR signaling between erythrocyte progenitors and liver cells progress the proliferation and differentiation of erythrocyte progenitors, and the mobilization of immature erythrocytes into the circulation. Our previous study showed that the anemic serum of phenylhydrazine administrated Xenopus contains erythroid colony forming activity; however, there is no information about the relationship between anemia and hypoxia enough to stimulate erythropoiesis in adult Xenopus . In mammalian species, Epo gene expression is upregulated by binding of hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) and ARNT complex to hypoxia response element (HRE) located in 3\u2032 enhancer region of Epo gene. In frog and fishes, EPO mRNAs are expressed even in normoxia condition. In fish Epo genes, consensus HRE sequence (ACGTG) were not found in 3\u2032UTR, as well as the reporter assay failed to show Epo upregulation respond to hypoxia. Since any consensus HRE sequence was not found in 3\u2032 UTR of xl Epo gene, we examined whether HIF-1a mediates xl Epo gene regulation. By western blot analysis of HIF-1a, we assessed whether HIF-1a is stabilized in anemia; meanwhile binding capacity of HIF-1a to 5\u2032, 3\u2032 UTRs and intron regions of xl Epo gene was analyzed by gel shift mobility assay. The findings in non-mammalian animal model demonstrate the basis of erythropoietic gene regulations, as well as molecular mechanism underlying adult extramedullary erythropoiesis.",
