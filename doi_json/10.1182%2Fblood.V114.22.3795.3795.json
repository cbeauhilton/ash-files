    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3795 Poster Board III-731 Gene expression profiles of CD34+ cells were compared between a cohort of 51 patients with MDS or AML from MDS and 7 healthy controls. The patients were classified according to the WHO criteria as follows: 5q- syndrome (n=7), RA (n=3), RARS (n=2), RCMD (n=10), RAEB-1 (n=7), RAEB-2 (n=15), and AML with MLD (multilineage dysplasia) (n=7). HumanRef-8 v2 Expression Bead Chips (Illumina) were used to generate expression profiles of the samples for >22,000 transcripts. The raw data were normalized data with the R software, lumi package. Normalized data were filtered by detection p-value <0.01, resulting in total number of 9811genes. To identify differentially expressed genes we performed two parallel statistical hypothesis testings: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) together with Tukey test and empirical bayesian thresholding correction for multiple testing problem; and Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM). The results were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR for six genes (TaqMan Gene Expression Assays). Hierarchical clustering of significantly differentially expressed genes clearly separated patients and controls, 5q-syndrome and RAEB-1 as a separate entities confirming usefulness of WHO classification subgroups. The most up-regulated genes in all patients included HBG2, HBG1, CYBRD1, HSPA1B, ANGPT1 , and MYC. We assume that expression changes in globin genes, both fetal and adult globins ( HBG2, HBG1 and HBA1, HBB) may play role not only in dysregulation of erythropoiesis but also in the disease progression or leukemic transformation of MDS. Among the most down-regulated genes, 13 genes related to B-lymphopoiesis (e.g. POU2AF1 , VPREB1 , VPREB3 , CD79A , EBF1 , LEF1, BCL3, IRF8 & IRF4 ) were detected, suggesting the abnormal development of B-cell progenitors in all MDS patients. Some of these genes (e.g. VPREB3, LEF1) showed decreasing trend in expression level from early to advanced MDS with the lowest expression in AML with MLD. Patients with advanced MDS had significantly decreased expression of genes involved in in the mitotic cell cycle, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation compared to early MDS where these gene subsets were up-regulated. The DAVID database also identified de-regulation in the cell cycle pathway through its 7 genes ( CDC25C , CDC7 , CDC20 , ORC1L , CCNB2 , BUB1, & CCNA2 ). On the other hand, advanced MDS patients showed significant up-regulation of proto-oncogenes (BMI1, MERTK) and genes related to angiogenesis (ANGPT1) , anti-apoptosis (VNN1). The results confirm on molecular basis that increased cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis together with a loss of cell cycle control, damaged DNA repair and altered immune response may play an important role in the expansion of malignant clone in MDS patients.
