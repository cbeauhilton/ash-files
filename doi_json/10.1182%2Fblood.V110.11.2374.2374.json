    "abstract_text": "Acquired drug resistance eventually leads to treatment failure in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). To define mechanisms of vincristine (VCR)-resistance, and to address whether inducible resistance in T-ALL might be mechanistically-dependent on ABC drug transporter expression, we developed VCR-resistant Sup T1 and Jurkat by incrementally growing cells in increasing drug concentrations. Jurkat (CD1a \u2212 , sCD3 + ) and Sup T1 (CD1a + , sCD3 \u2212 ) are arrested at \u201cmature\u201d and \u201ccortical\u201d stages of T-cell development and, respectively, showed 1190-fold (0.0006 \u03bcM to 0.714 \u03bcM) and 790-fold (0.0006 \u03bcM to 0.474 \u03bcM) increased resistance to VCR. Microarray analysis showed that expression of the ATP Binding Cassette C1 (ABCC1; Multidrug Resistance Protein, MDR2 ) was increased more than 29-fold in VCR-resistant cells as compared to the parental controls; fold increases in mRNA of ABCC1 were confirmed by RT-PCR, and cell surface expression by flow cytometric analysis. We then employed a flow cytometry-based assay that measures the ability of ABC pumps to extrude fluorescent dyes (Calcein AM). We confirmed that VCR-resistant Jurkat and Sup T1 actively extrude Calcein AM; drug extrusion was also effectively blocked by verapamil and other known ABCB1 antagonists. In contrast to our previous observations for ABCB1-mediated multidrug resistance ( Estes, et al., British Journal of Haematology , in press ), ABCC1-mediated drug resistance conferred a more narrow spectrum of multidrug resistance for the chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in T-ALL induction. To investigate whether ABC expression might impact patient outcome, we next examined ABCC1 and ABCB1 expression (>1.5-fold) in 80 T-ALL patients treated on COG studies 8704 and 9404. Different from our earlier findings that ABCB1 expression in diagnostic marrows conferred a 100% risk for on-therapy relapse, we found that ABCC1 expression only predicted treatment failure in approximately 25% of affected patients. These results suggest that ABC transporters are differentially regulated in Sup T1 and Jurkat, and that substrate-specific ABC protein regulation results in unique multidrug resistance phenotypes in T-ALL. This study contributes to the repertoire of substrate-specific, drug resistant T-ALL cells lines that are available for modeling treatment failure, provides mechanistically-based insights into relapse, and establishes an experimental means for investigating compounds that reverse ABCC1 mediated drug resistance."
