    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Multilple myeloma (MM) rarely occurs in patients \u2264 40 years of age. Thus, information regarding disease features and outcome is limited. We performed a retrospective analysis of the database of GMSG which includes 1162 patients with symptomatic MM who were diagnosed since 1987. Patients and methods: Multiple clinical and laboratory variables were evaluated in patients \u2264 40 years of age and in older patients including the recently proposed International Staging System (ISS) for MM. Furthermore, the same variables were assessed for possible correlation with prognosis in patients \u2264 40 years of age. Patients with asymptomatic MM were not included. Results: Forty seven (4%) patients were \u2264 40 year old when treatment was initiated. Clinical and laboratory parameters were similar among the two groups of patients with the exception of ISS which was lower in younger patients (p=0.03). Despite a similar response to primary treatment the median survival of younger patients was significantly longer than that of older patients (65 months versus 37 months; p=0.001). Among younger patients, hypercalcemia, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow plasmacytosis and elevated serum LDH were associated with impaired survival on univariate analysis. ISS was not statistically significant (p=0.1) but the median survival of patients with ISS 1,2 and 3 was 154 months, 60 months and 33 months respectively. A Cox regression analysis showed that only elevated serum LDH was significant and was associated with a median survival of 9 months. Conclusions: Young patients with symptomatic myeloma have similar disease features with older patients but present with a lower ISS. Patients \u2264 40 years of age live twice as long when compared to older patients with symptomatic MM. Elevated serum LDH identified a subgroup of patients (23%) who had an extremely poor outcome. 40% of young patients presented with ISS 1 and survived for more than a decade. This information may be of value when designing therapeutic strategies for young patients with myeloma especially when allogeneic stem cell transplantation is considered."
