    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4635 Nuclear inositide signalling pathways are involved in the MDS progression to AML. Indeed, in the last few years our group demonstrated not only that MDS cells can show alterations on PI-PLCbeta1 and Akt pathways, but also that Akt is inversely correlated with PI-PLCbeta1, therefore affecting MDS cell survival and differentiation. Lenalidomide has proven effectiveness in 70\u201380% low-risk MDS cases with del(5q), resulting in transfusion-independence with a rise in hemoglobin levels, suppression of the 5q clone, and improvement of bone marrow morphologic features. In particular, in del(5q) MDS, Lenalidomide probably acts by directly suppressing the dysplastic clone, while in non-del(5q) it might enhance an effective erythropoiesis, possibly via activation of the EPO signalling, which in turn is associated with PI-PLCgamma1 pathways. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of Lenalidomide in MDS cells are still not completely clarified. Interestingly, Lenalidomide might inhibit the phosphatase PP2A, whose gene is located in the common deleted region and which usually targets Akt. Indeed, Akt-dependent pathways are critical in low-risk MDS cells, which display a marked apoptosis and a low proliferation rate. In this study we examined four MDS patients treated with Lenalidomide, and compared them with four low-risk MDS patients (IPSS: Low or Int-1) who only received best supportive care. In our study, all of the patients treated with Lenalidomide were affected by del(5q) low-risk MDS (IPSS: Low or Int-1), with transfusion-dependent anemia, and had only received supportive care before undergoing Lenalidomide treatment. Clinically, all of the patients responded to Lenalidomide: one patient reached Complete Remission, whilst the other three patients showed erythroid Hematologic Improvement. In contrast, all of the patients who were treated only with best supportive care maintained a Stable Disease. As for the molecular effects of Lenalidomide on lipid signalling pathways, we analyzed the expression of critical molecules involved in both cell proliferation and differentiation, that is PI-PLCbeta1 and its downstream target Cyclin D3, as well as PI-PLCgamma1, which is linked with EPO signalling. Ongoing analyses are also trying to examine the effect of Lenalidomide on Akt phosphorylation and Globin genes, which are specifically associated with erythropoiesis. So far, our results indicate that, in our responder patients, both PI-PLCbeta1 and Cyclin D3 are not significantly affected by Lenalidomide, whereas PI-PLCgamma1 is specifically induced, as compared with both healthy subjects and low-risk MDS patients treated with supportive care. Overall, these findings hint at a specific activation of PI-PLCgamma1 signalling following Lenalidomide treatment, and possibly pave the way to larger investigations aiming to better understand the role of these pathways in the mechanism of action of Lenalidomide in del(5q) MDS.
