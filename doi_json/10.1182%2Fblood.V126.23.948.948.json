    "abstract_text": "Nutritional fasting is associated with hypoferremia; however serum iron parameters otherwise differ from those observed with dietary iron deficiency. Activation of the hepcidin gene via the transcription factor CREB-H has been implicated in inducing this hypoferremia. We examined the contribution of the PPAR\u03b1 another hepatocellular transcription factor induced by fasting in this regulation. Six week old male AKR mice ( N = 6) were fed diet with 60 ppm Fe ad libitum and fasted for overnight (18 hours). Tissue and blood samples were collected to evaluate iron parameters and gene expression in comparison to fed controls. All mice were provided water ad libitum . In the fasted mice, serum iron (321 and 199 \u00b5g/dL, respectively for fed and fasted mice, P = 0.001) as well as transferrin saturation (80% and 64% respectively for fed and fasted mice, P = 0.04) decreased significantly. Fasted mice also had elevated hematocrit (43% and 47%, respectively, for the fed and fasted mice, P = 0.001) in association with weight loss (22g and 18g, respectively, for the fed and fasted mice, P < 0.01), consistent with hemoconcentration. In addition, 18h fasting induced a significant increase in hepatic (735 and 953 \u00b5g/g dry, respectively for the fed and fasted mice, P < 0.05) and splenic non-heme iron content (414 and 488 \u00b5g/g dry, respectively for the fed and fasted mice, P < 0.001), and elevated hepatic hamp1 mRNA levels (4-fold increase from the fed group, P < 0.001). To elucidate the mechanism of the Hamp1up-regulation, we measured liver Creb-h and ppar\u03b1 mRNA levels, and observed elevated Creb-h (by 4-fold, P < 0.001) and ppara mRNA levels (by 3-fold, P < 0.001) in the fasted mice. To further elucidate the roles of CREB-H, and PPAR\u03b1 in the regulation of Hamp1 during fasting, we performed fasting-refeeding studies in 10-12 week old male C57BL/6 mice. These mice ( N = 4-6) were fed with chow ad libitum , fasted overnight, or fasted overnight then re-fed for 4 hours. Fasting at this age also induced increased in liver ppar\u03b1, creb-h , and hamp1 mRNA levels (by 2.5-, 3- and 6-fold, respectively), and refeeding over this timeframe was associated with decreases in ppar\u03b1, creb-h , and hamp1 to levels that are similar to fed mice, even though the serum and tissue iron levels were not restored. To determine if PPAR\u03b1 contributes to the regulation of hepcidin, we examined the fasting response of PPAR\u03b1 -/- mice. The fasting-associated increases in expression of hamp1 and creb-h were dampened in the PPAR\u03b1-/- mice. In the WT mice, fasting induced a hamp1 increase of 2.6-fold ( P = 0.002), whereas in the PPAR\u03b1 -/- mice, the expression was unchanged (0.8-fold, P = 0.11). Similarly, fasting induced a creb-h increase of 2.8-fold in the WT mice ( P = 0.0003) but a 1.1-fold increase in the PPAR\u03b1 -/- mice ( P = 0.004). The magnitude of change in hamp1 ( P < 0.05) and in creb-h ( P < 0.001) expression between WT and PPAR\u03b1 -/- mice were statistically significant. These findings indicate that PPAR\u03b1 contributes to creb-h and hamp1 up-regulation during fasting-induced changes in iron metabolism. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
