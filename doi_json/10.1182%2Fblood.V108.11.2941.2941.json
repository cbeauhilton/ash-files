    "abstract_text": "Derivitization, a chemical technique used to transform a compound into a similar product with a different structure required by certain detection methods, was carried out for the detection of Busulfan (Bu) in human plasma. Using a proficient scientific method and enhancing its clinical association our method furthered the pre-column derivitization technique based on isocratic high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). In-house adjustments have been made over the course of the last two years in order to increase the efficiency and turn-around of the method assay for clinical purposes. The concentration of drug in human plasma was measured with UV detection at 278nm by employing a Waters Nov-Pak C-18 analytical column heated to 40\u00b0C. The mobile phase, run at 1.5mL/min, consisted of a mixture of 20:80 deionized water and methanol respectively. All concentration-time plasma Bu data were analyzed by a non-compartmental analysis employing linear kinetics using WinNonlin Version 4.1 software (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). Analyses were performed on 155 allogeneic Stem-Cell Transplant (SCT) patients (pts). All pts received fludarabine 50mg/m 2 on days -6 to -2 and IV Bu at a \u201cmyeloablative\u201d dose of 3.2mg/kg daily, on days -5 to -2 inclusive. Additional TBI 200cGy \u00d7 2 was given to 74 pts. Graft-vs.-host disease prophylaxis for all pts comprised cyclosporine A, \u201cshort course\u201d methotrexate with folinic acid and Thymoglobulin (Genzyme) 4.5mg/kg administered in divided doses over 3 consecutive days pre-transplant finishing on D0. The range of area under the curve (AUC) per dose was 2184 to 7513\u03bcM\u00b7min (median 4509\u03bcM\u00b7min). Twenty nine pts (19%) had AUC < 3600\u03bcM\u00b7min and 17 (11%) had AUC > 6000\u03bcM\u00b7min. The remaining 109 (70%) were between 3600 and 6000\u03bcM\u00b7min, equivalent to an exposure of 900 \u2013 1500\u03bcM\u00b7min per dose established as desirable from studies of qid oral Bu given with cyclophosphamide. We found that IV Bu resulted in a 3\u20134 fold variability in AUC with a significant number of pts with exposures deemed either too high or low. High exposures (> 6000uM*min) increase the risk of transplant-related death and there is justification for therapeutic monitoring. Our predicted adjustments obtained from a streamlined method are based on day -5 Bu doses. The adjusted doses are administered on days -3 and -2, allowing for a 24 hour turn around time between days -5 and -3."
