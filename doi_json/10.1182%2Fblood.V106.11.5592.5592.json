    "abstract_text": "To promote patient education, the Dartmouth Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Program created a website focusing on Quality Reports, highlighting outcomes and patient satisfaction data. In an attempt to address areas most important to potential patients, the development of the website involved Transplant physicians and nurses, outside reviewers and recently transplanted patients. Based on these assessments and interviews, the BMT website was designed to provide various outcome data, including disease-specific overall- and disease-free survival, length of stay, and incidence of nausea. The website became public in January 2004. The use of the public website was evaluated 18 months after initiation. There was a 300% increase in external user visits to the Dartmouth BMT Website (comparing 3 month averages). Eighty percent of the information accessed was in the topic of \u201cSafe and Effective Care\u201d, which addresses patient-specific data, including survival statistics, length of stay, or toxicities during the transplant. The remaining 20% of interest was satisfaction measures addressing patients\u2019 view of their overall care, opinions addressing nursing care or physician interaction. Of the top ten measures that were evaluated by users, the first 9 were disease-specific survival statistics and the remaining was \u201cAverage Length of Hospital Stay\u201d. Individual interviews with patients (n=16) indicate that the information provided on the web site increased the trust of the institution. In addition, patients felt re-assured concerning their selection of our institution. In conclusion, the initiation of the Dartmouth BMT Quality Reports Website ( http://www.dhmc.org/QualityReports ) that focuses on outcome data resulted in a marked increased use of the Dartmouth BMT Website within 18 months. Patients were most interested in disease-specific survival statistics, followed by transplant patients\u2019 opinions of their care. Patients report that the \u201ctransparency\u201d of outcome results and the patient education provided by the website improve their trust of our BMT program/hospital and foster assurance of our institution\u2019s reputation.",
