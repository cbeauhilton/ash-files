    "abstract_text": "Background : Tazemetostat (TAZ), an enhancer of zeste homolog 2 inhibitor, showed antitumor activity as monotherapy in patients with wild-type and mutant EZH2 relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) who received \u22652 prior lines of therapy. In clinical studies in patients with R/R FL, lenalidomide and rituximab (R 2 ) demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 73%-78% and median progression-free survival of 36-39 months. Preclinical data demonstrated synergistic activity of TAZ + lenalidomide, and clinical experience with TAZ + rituximab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma supports the combination of TAZ + R 2 in patients with R/R FL. This global, multicenter phase 1b/3 study (NCT04224493) is designed to determine the recommended phase 3 dose (RP3D), efficacy, and safety of TAZ + R 2 in patients with R/R FL after \u22651 prior therapy. We report an interim analysis of the phase 1b safety run-in. Methods : The methods of this randomized, double-blind, 3-stage study were previously described (Leonard JP, et al. ASH 2020). Phase 1b evaluated TAZ at 3 dose levels (400, 600, and 800 mg orally twice daily [BID]) in 28-day cycles with standard-dose R 2 using a 3+3 design. The RP3D of TAZ will be selected at the dose level with a target dose-limiting toxicity (DLT; NCI CTCAE v5) rate of <33%. Preliminary efficacy analysis was performed on the intent-to-treat population and reported as best overall response per investigator assessment according to Lugano 2014 response criteria. Results : As of February 26, 2021, 15 patients were enrolled and receiving treatment with TAZ + R 2 (400 mg [n=4], 600 mg [n=4], and 800 mg [n=6]). Data for the 15th patient enrolled at 800 mg BID were not available as of the cutoff date; thus, this patient is not included in the current safety analysis. The 14 patients included had a median age of 65.5 years (range, 51-83) and received a median of 2 prior therapies (range, 1-5). Median duration of treatment exposure was 16.9 weeks (range, 8-28); dose modifications for treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are shown in the Table. No DLTs were observed in phase 1b, and no new safety signals were identified as of the February 2021 data cutoff. A summary of TEAEs is provided in the Table. Serious TEAEs were observed in 3 (21.4%) patients. Grade 3/4 TEAEs were observed in 7 (50.0%) patients; the most common grade 3/4 TEAE (\u226520%) was decreased neutrophil count (21.4%). Febrile neutropenia and severe cytopenias have not been reported to date. Treatment-related TEAEs (TR-TEAEs) of any grade were observed in 12 (85.7%) patients; grade 3/4 TR-TEAEs were observed in 5 (35.7%) patients. The TR-TEAEs were attributable to either study agent. Of the 12 patients evaluable for tumor assessment, 5 (41.7%) had a complete response, 6 (50.0%) had a partial response, and 1 (8.3%) had stable disease. The ORR was 91.7% (n=11). Conclusions : The TAZ + R 2 combination demonstrates a favorable safety profile that is consistent with the respective safety information for TAZ and for R 2 . The high response rates reported from the preliminary efficacy analysis support a benefit with the combination of TAZ + R 2 . The randomized phase 3 portion will further explore the efficacy and safety of TAZ + R 2 in ~500 patients with R/R FL.
