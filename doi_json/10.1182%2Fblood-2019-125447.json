    "abstract_text": "Background: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a disease of the elderly, whose prognoses are highly heterogeneous. Hence International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) proposed geriatric assessment (GA) in 2015, including daily activity and comorbidity status, to better discriminate between fit and frail patients (Palumbo et al, 2015). However, IMWG recruited patients from clinical trials instead of real world practices. Therefore we studied GA in elderly MM patients consecutively in China, along with other perspectives which are known to be problematic in elderly population that were previously left unnoticed, such as nutrition status, risk of cognitive impairment, risk of depression, and quality of life. Aim: Our study centers on the feasibility to perform a more comprehensive geriatric assessment (cGA) in elderly MM patients, current cGA status in elderly MM patients in China, and the cGA difference between Chinese patients and patients in the IMWG study. Method: From August 2017 to April 2019, we continuously recruited 336 newly diagnosed elderly (age \u2265 65) MM patients from 21 centers in China. cGA was performed at diagnosis, after treatment cycle 1, after cycle 4, and 1 year after treatment. cGA includes physical conditions (ECOG), activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental ADL (IADL), mini-nutritional assessment (MNA-SF), geriatric depression scale (GDS), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), quality of life (SF-36) and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Staging was assessed at baseline (International Staging System (ISS) & Revised ISS) and hematological responses were evaluated along with each cGA timepoint. Results: We pool-analyzed data of 336 newly-diagnosed elderly MM patients. The median age was 70 (range 65-88) and 25.5% of patients were older than 75 years. 336 (100%) patients were able to complete cGA, and median assessment time was 40 minutes (range 20-70). Upon diagnosis, only 34% and 37.5% of patients had full ADL and IADL respectively. 38.5% of patients had moderate to high risk of depression (GDS \u2265 6). 13.2% of patients were malnourished (MNA-SF \u2264 7), while 46.3% of patients were at risk of malnutrition (8 \u2264 MNA-SF \u2264 11). 41% of patients had at least one comorbidity (CCI \u2265 1). 45.7% of patients had moderate to intermediate risk of cognitive impairment (MMSE \u2264 26). Grouping by IMWG-GA index, our study identified 59.9% patients in frail group (vs 39% in IMWG study), 15.8% in intermediate (vs 31% in IMWG) and 24.3% in fit (vs 30% in IMWG). 69% of patients received proteasome inhibitor-containing regimens and 20.7% of patients received lenalidomide-containing regimens. Best hematological responses in fit and intermediate groups were better than responses in frail group (\u2265 PR rate: 88.5% in fit, 94.4% in intermediate vs 77.5% in frail). Median follow up time was 10 months. To date, 215 (64%) patients have finished the cGA after cycle 1; 164 (48.8%) patients have finished the cGA after cycle 4; 91 (27.1%) patients has finished all 4 planned cGA and improvements in cGA were observed in the majority of these patients. Conclusion: Our study showed significant CGA heterogeneity in elderly MM patients. Even in the IMWG-GA \"fit\" group, nutrition, depression and cognitive impairment remain problems. Frail patients took up a larger proportion in Chinese elderly MM patients compared to IMWG study. Our study strongly justifies the necessity for cGA in elderly patients with MM, more so in the real world MM patients than in the clinical trials.
