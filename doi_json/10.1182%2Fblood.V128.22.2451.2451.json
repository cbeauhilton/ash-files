    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Non-hereditary hemolytic anemia of unknown etiology after an exhaustive work-up is commonly known as direct antiglobulin test (DAT)-negative hemolytic anemia. Due to its rarity, limited data are available regarding this condition. We performed this retrospective study to determine the frequency, associated medical conditions, treatments used, and clinical outcome of patients with DAT- negative hemolytic anemia. METHODS: We included adult (age >18 years) patients with DAT-negative hemolytic anemia seen at Mayo Clinic from 1997-2015 who met all of the following criteria: a) hemoglobin (Hb)< 12 g/dL; b) presence of hemolysis (reticulocytosis, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, and/or elevated indirect bilirubin); c) DAT-negative; and d) unknown etiology of hemolytic anemia after extensive work-up appropriate for clinical context. Remission status after appropriate therapy for perceived hemolysis was defined as follows: a) complete remission (CR; Hb \u226512g/dL and normalization of at least one previously abnormal hemolytic marker); b) partial remission (PR; Hb: 10-11.9 g/dL with evidence of ongoing hemolysis); c) no remission (NR; neither CR nor PR). In order to calculate the relative frequency of DAT-negative hemolytic anemia, we also determined the number of DAT-positive hemolytic anemia cases during the same time period using the above criteria for hemolytic anemia. RESULTS: During the 19-year study period, 24 and 484 patients were diagnosed with DAT- negative and DAT-positive hemolytic anemia, respectively, a ratio of 1:20. Among those with DAT-negative hemolytic anemia, the majority were males (67%) and the median age at diagnosis was 70 years (range, 22-87). Six patients (25%) had pre-existing autoimmune conditions including immune thrombocytopenia (n=3), Crohn's disease (n=2), and Grave's disease (n=1). All patients had negative DAT by conventional method with one patient turning positive at 104 days after initial diagnosis. Enhanced DAT technique using 4\u00b0C low-ionic strength saline wash was performed in one case and was negative. In general, peripheral blood smear showed polychromasia, occasional spherocytes, and no schistocytes or bite cells. Additional work-ups performed based on clinical context and proportion of patients tested (all results negative or normal) were as follows: hemoglobin electrophoresis (54%), flow cytometry for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (92%), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase level (67%), osmotic fragility test/eosin-5'-maleimide stain for hereditary spherocytosis (54%), other red blood cell enzymes (46%), computed tomographic scan of the body to look for occult malignancy (46%), and bone marrow biopsy (50%). The median hemoglobin at diagnosis was 8.5 g/dL (range, 4.5-11.8). Fourteen patients (58.3%) required blood transfusion during the course of their disease. Sixteen patients (67%) received prednisone as initial therapy with 19% CR and 38% PR response rates. Subsequent therapies included: rituximab (n=6; 40% PR), cyclophosphamide (n=2; 100% NR), mycophenolate mofetil (n=1; 100% NR), intravenous immunoglobulin (n=2; 100% NR), and splenectomy (n=6; 50% CR and 33.3% PR), respectively. The median follow-up for all cases was 32.9 months (range, 2-433). Six patients (25%) developed hematologic malignancies after a median follow-up of 8.7 months (range, 0.7-29.3), which included primary myelofibrosis (n=2), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=1), mantle cell lymphoma (n=1), non-Hodgkin lymphoma-not otherwise specified (n=1), and T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (n=1). At last follow-up, 9 patients (38%) were in CR and 8 (33%) in PR. Relapses occurred in 67% and 0% of patients who received prednisone and splenectomy, respectively. CONCLUSION: At our institution, DAT-negative hemolytic anemia was approximately 20 times less common than DAT-positive hemolytic anemia. Most patients were treated with either immunosuppressive agents with or without splenectomy. Splenectomy was the most effective treatment. At least a quarter of the patients were eventually diagnosed with hematologic malignancies mostly within a year of DAT-negative hemolytic anemia diagnosis. Routine upfront evaluation for hematologic malignancies might be necessary for these patients. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
