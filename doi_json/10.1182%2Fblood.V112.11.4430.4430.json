    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in pediatric patients with high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) such as those with non-Down de novo acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), transformed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), therapy-related AML (tAML) and refractory/resistant AML (rAML) has been limited by graft failure, regimen related toxicity (RRT) and relapse. Between September 2005 and July 2008, 10 pediatric patients, median age of 7.6 (range, 1.3 \u2013 17.0) years with such high risk AML (AMKL, n=2; MDS/AML, n=4; tAML, n=1; rAML; n=3) received a novel Fludarabinebased preparative regimen followed by T cell replete transplantation with bone marrow (BM, n=4), peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC, n=5) or umbilical cord blood (UCB, n=1) in a Singapore Pediatric BMT center. Seven patients received stem cells from alternate donors (AD) and 3 from matched related donors (MRD). Prior to HCT, 6 patients were in 1 st complete remission (CR1), 2 in CR2 and 2 had progressive diseases. AD consisted of single antigen mismatched related and non-genoidentical unrelated donors (antigenic match at HLA-A, B, DRB1*). All patients received IV FLU 125 mg/m2, BU, 0.8 \u2013 1.2 mg/kg 6 hourly, MEL, 140mg/m2. AD recipients received additional ATG (Thymoglobuline) 5mg/kg. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate or mycophenolate motfetil depending on the stem cell source. Excluding the 2 patients who entered HCT with progressive diseases, all other patients achieved myeloid engraftment at a median of 14 (range, 9 \u2013 16) days and achieved sustained stable full donor chimera from 21 days after HCT. The median duration and costs of HCT admissions was 34 (range, 17 \u2013 66) days and USD 51,317 (range, 41,416 \u2013 155,905), respectively. Common post-HCT complications included engraftment syndrome (n=4) and reactivation of Herpes viruses (n=4). There was no severe RRT. Incidences of grade I\u2013III acute GVHD and chronic GVHD were 63% and 67%, respectively. All these patients are alive in sustained CR at a median follow-up of 303 (range, 44 \u2013 1037) days with Karnosky/Lansky scores of 90 \u2013 100%. Both the patients with progressive diseases had graft failures and subsequently died of disease at a median of 138 (range, 77 \u2013 198) days after HCT despite experimental salvage therapy with allogeneic natural killer cell transplantation from parental donors. In summary, this novel FLU based preparative regimen paired with non-genoidentical HCT is safe, inexpensive, allows prompt engraftment, and appears to provide anti-leukemia effects in pediatric patients with high risk AML entering HCT in remission. Long term follow-up will determine relapse risks and whether this non-irradiation based regimen is associated with a reduction in late effects including malignancy.",
