    "abstract_text": "Increased numbers of COVID-19 infection make the study of its systemic manifestations more and more important. Despite of SARS-Cov-2 main clinical respiratory syndrome other clinical infection signs as immune thrombocytopenia without respiratory failure were identified. We have seen case series of patients with thrombocytopenia and active COVID-19 infection during present epidemic outbreak. Patient 1, female, 31 years old was admitted at our hospital with ecchymoses, epistaxis, gingival hemorrhage and metrorrhagia. There were also signs of COVID-19 infection - fever up to 40 o C, short of breathes with room air. The pulmonary infiltrates about to 25% were revealed by CT scan. The CBC parameters were as follows: WBC 8.9x10 9 /l, Hb 11,2 g/dl, PLT 3 x10 9 /l by microscopy. The patient was treated with high-dose dexamethasone 40 mg QD for 4 days. The treatment resulted to stable complete platelet response as 189x10 9 /l in fourteen days after start of therapy. At that time, the cancer in situ of cervix uteri there was revealed by gynecologic examination, that was successfully local treated. Patient 2, female 30 years old presented epistaxis, metrorrhagia, cutaneous and gingival hemorrhagic syndrome as previous patient. There were WBC 6.4x10 9 /l, Hb 12,6 g/dl, PLT 3x10 9 /l by microscopy in CBC. She had no respiratory signs and abnormality in pulmonary CT. The COVID-19 infection was identified by PCR and antibody screening. The patient also received high-dose dexamethasone 40 mg QD for 4 days and yielded of platelet elevation to 25x10 9 /l with no hemorrhagic syndrome in five days of treatment. Patient 3, female 68 years old with chronic course of immune thrombocytopenia and resistance to glucocorticoid, after splenectomy and presence of HBsAg. All relapses of thrombocytopenia in this patient were associated with virus infection. The first episode was in 2009, patient was treated with glucocorticoid with no effect. The complete platelet response was achieved after splenectomy. The relapse occurred in 2015 and was associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (probably H7N9 flu). There treatment with prednisone 1 mg/day resulted to complete platelet response. At present time, the COVID-19 infection on this patient manifested with 75% of pulmonary volume lesions. At the recovery (25% of pulmonary infiltrates) the relapse of immune thrombocytopenia with cutaneous bleeding occurred. In CBC there were WBC 5.9x10 9 /l, Hb 15,1 g/dl, PLT 5x10 9 /l by microscopy. Given that history of therapy we treated this patient with high-dose dexamethasone 40 mg QD for 4 days and romiplostime 2 mqg/kg. The complete resolution of hemorrhagic signs and platelet response (65x10 9 /l) was reached in seven days of treatment. Discussion. The virus-associated thrombocytopenia is usual in common practice. In recent COVID-19 infection outcome meta-analysis (G. Lippi et al. Clinica Chimica Acta 506 (2020) 145-148) the platelet count was significantly lower in severe course of disease. The presence of platelet below the lower limit was associated with fivefold of risk of severe COVID-19 and was a factor of mortality. The platelet decline could be as sign of disease worsening at one hand and have an own risk of mortality by bleeding at other hand. There is a need for guideline to thrombocytopenia management in COVID-19 patients. Now we are continuing to search and include the patients with COVID-19 infection and thrombocytopenia in our study.
