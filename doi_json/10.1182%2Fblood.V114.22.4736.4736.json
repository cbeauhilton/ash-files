    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4736 Background Invasive zygomycosis accounts for a significant proportion of all invasive fungal diseases (IFD), but clinical data on the clinical course and treatment response is limited. Methods Fungiscope\u201d - A Global Rare Fungal Infection Registry is a university-based case registry that collects data of patients with rare IFD, using a web-based electronic case form at www.fungiscope.net . Results Fourty-one patients with invasive zygomycosis were registered. Five were pediatric (12.2%), 28 (68.3%) male. Median age was 49 years (range 2-88). Most common underlying conditions were malignancies (n=26; 63.4%), diabetes mellitus (n=7; 17%) and solid organ transplant (n=4; 9.8%). Diagnosis was made by culture in 28 patients (68.3%), by histology in 26 patients (63.4%). Main sites of infection were lungs (n=24; 58.5%), soft tissues (n=8; 19.5%), rhino-sinu-orbital (n=8; 19.5%), brain (n=6; 14.6%). Disseminated infection of >1 non-contiguous sites was seen in 4 patients (9.8%). A favorable response was observed in 23 patients (56.1%). Overall survival was 51.2%. At diagnosis, ten patients (24.4%) were under continuous antifungal prophylaxis with itraconazole (n=1; 2.4%) or posaconazole (n=3; 7.3%). Empiric treatment was administered to 17 patients (41.4%). Survival was significantly improved in patients receiving active (n=7; 17.1%), as opposed to inactive empiric treatment (p=0.036). Initial targeted treatment with activity against zygomycetes was administered to 34 patients (82.9%). Liposomal amphotericin B was associated with improved response (p=0.012), and survival rates (p=0.004). Additional surgical treatment was performed in 21 patients (51.2%) and was not associated with improved response or survival. Conclusion Invasive zygomycosis is associated with low response rates to surgical and antifungal therapy. There was a marked amount of breakthrough infections under antifungal prophylaxis, including posaconazole. Only few patients received empiric treatment with activity against zygomycetes. Initial treatment with a polyene was associated with improved survival rates. Disclosures: Rueping: Essex/Schering-Plough: Speakers Bureau.
