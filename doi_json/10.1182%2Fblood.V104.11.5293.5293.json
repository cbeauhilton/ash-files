    "abstract_text": "Extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) is an effective, relatively new technique, FDA approved for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, employed as second-third line treatment in patients affected with GVHD not or poorely responsive to standard immunosuppressive drugs. Both aGVHD and cGVHD are the major complications after stem cell transplantation (till to 50% and 80% of the patients, respectively). Corticosteroids, cyclosporine, micofenolate, tacrolimus and various experimental monoclonal antibodies (anti CD40 ligand, anti TNF\u03b1 etc) are the drugs employed to control GVHD and are burdened with important short and long term side effects. Recently we revised our data about 102 pts (children and adults) treated by ECP in our Institution. The overall response was 75%, permitting to taper or suspend the immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in 67.6% of the pts. The economical and social impact (cost analysis and quality of life) of ECP vs standard IST was calculated basing on the National Price List and on Short Form Quality of Life (QoL) Scoring System. The cost of ECP comprehensive of the leukapheresis procedure, waste matherials and dedicated personnel was estimated as 684.51 Euro/procedure. On the other side, when the solely costs of the most common IST drugs (corticosteroids, cyclosporine) were considered for 5 months of treatment, an evident and obvious economical advantage emerged (120,3 E). On the contrary, when the costs of hospitalisation and day hospital regimen derived from the most common side effects related to the solely use of IST were included in our cost analysis studies, an economical advantage for long term ECP treatment (calculated on 16 procedures) was demonstrated (14952.16 E vs 17553 E). Moreover, when the \u201creal life implication\u201d calculated on the QoL parameters were considered, the advantages were more evident. In conclusion, the tie of respecting strictly an imposed program of budget calculated on the short period may exert an inhibitory effect in introducing new diagnostic or therapeutic procedures ignoring that the improvement or the cure of the patient has always a positive economical counterpart, expecially when the impact of a new technology is considered in a long term view."
