    "abstract_text": "Recent studies have documented that cell metabolism regulates hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) renewal and lineage commitment. However, the detailed metabolic changes that occur during human erythropoiesis remain to be defined. As erythroid cell differentiation is likely to be associated with changes in metabolic requirements, we hypothesized that progenitors adapt to these metabolic modulations by altering their nutrient transporter expression profile. Using an in vitro erythroid-inducing cell culture system employing CD34+ cells from human bone marrow and peripheral blood as well as primary erythroid cells isolated from fresh bone marrow samples, we assessed the cell surface nutrient transporter profiles of progenitors at different stages of erythroid development. Quantification of cell surface nutrient transporter expression was performed using a novel scaffold of retroviral envelope receptor binding domains (RBDs) that function as specific ligands of solute carrier (SLC) nutrient transporters. This bank allowed an evaluation of diverse metabolite transporters including GLUT1/SLC2A1 glucose transporter, the PiT1/SLC20A1 and PiT2/SLC20A2 phosphate importers, the XPR1/SLC53A1 phosphate exporter, the FLVCR1 heme exporter, the RFVT1/2 (SLC52A1/SLC52A2) riboflavin importers, the CAT1/SLC7A1 arginine importer, the ASCT2/SLC1A5 glutamine transporter and the SMVT/SLC5A6 sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter. Notably, the cell surface expression profiles of these nutrient transporters, as evaluated by flow cytometry, revealed marked changes as a function of the stage of erythroid differentiation, as shown in the figure below. Specifically, while FLVCR1, RFVT1/2, and SMVT are highly expressed on erythroid progenitors, the levels of these transporters decrease starting at the proerythroblast stage. In addition, PiT1, PiT2, XPR1, and CAT1 are expressed highly during the erythroid colony forming unit (CFU-E) stage while GLUT1 gradually increases and reaches a peak at late stages of erythroid differentiation, remaining elevated on mature red cells. The noted distinct changes in transporter expression are likely a reflection of the changing demands of various nutrients during human erythropoiesis. In summary, we have established a comprehensive metabolite transporter profile at distinct stages of normal human erythropoiesis using a novel experimental strategy. These original findings form a strong foundation for future studies aiming at elucidating the metabolic requirements of normal erythropoiesis, evaluating diseases affecting red blood cell maturation due to aberrant metabolic regulation, and for identifying new therapeutic targets.
