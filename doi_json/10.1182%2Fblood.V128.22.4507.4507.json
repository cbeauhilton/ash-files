    "abstract_text": "Background: While novel agents have improved the outcome for multiple myeloma (MM), the disease remains incurable. Our preclinical work has shown that MM cells from relapsed/refractory patients are very sensitive to the combination of Reolysin (a proprietary formulation of an oncolytic reovirus) and bortezomib (BZ), resulting in synergistic levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. A pilot phase 1 study showed that Reolysin was well tolerated in relapsed/refractory MM patients and was associated with prolonged stable disease. Methods: Relapsed/refractory MM patients including patients refractory to BZ were included. This is a phase 1b study of 3 escalating doses of Reolysin (cohort 1; 3 x10 10 TCID 50 , cohort 2; 4.5 x10 10 TCID 50 , and cohort 3; 9 x10 10 TCID 50 ). Reolysin is given on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Patients receive 40 mg dexamethasone and 1.5 mg/m 2 bortezomib on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles are repeated every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Results: Eight patients have been enrolled, seven were male and the median age was 55 (range, 33 - 66). The median number of prior therapies was 4 (range 1 to 6). All patients were previously exposed to BZ, and 6 patients were previously exposed to both an immunomodulatory agent and carfilzomib. Most patients had ISS stage I disease at study entry (n=5), 2 had stage II and 1 had stage III. The combination was well tolerated and most treatment-related toxicities were transient and easily managed with supportive care. The most common treatment-related toxicities were grade 1 diarrhea (n=4), grade 1 fatigue (n=4), grade 1 flu-like symptoms (n=5) and grade 1 headache (n=4). No dose limiting toxicities occurred in cohort 1 or 2. Three patients completed 1 cycle of treatment only, 2 completed 3 cycles, and 1 patient completed 4 cycles. One patient remains on treatment. Reasons for treatment discontinuation included disease progression (n=4), clinical deterioration (n=1) and patient withdrawal (n=2). Six patients were evaluable for response, 3 patients had stable disease lasting at least 3 cycles whereas 3 patients had progressive disease at the end of cycle 1. Ex vivo treatment of primary MM cells and MM cell lines (U266 and RPMI-8226) with Reolysin revealed a dramatic induction of PD-L1 expression as measured by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. Furthermore, ex vivo treatment of MM patient mononuclear cells with Reolysin resulted in NK and T cell activation. These results suggest that the addition of an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agent may augment the anti-MM activity of Reolysin. Conclusions: The combination of Reolysin, BZ and dexamethasone is well tolerated in a heavily pretreated MM patient population. Cohort 3 is currently enrolling at the 9 x10 10 TCID 50 dose level of Reolysin. The potential anti-MM effects of immune activation following Reolysin infusion may be mitigated by MM expression of PD-L1. Additional cohorts exploring the tolerability, efficacy and pharmacodynamics of the combination of Reolysin, BZ or carfilzomib, dexamethasone and an immune checkpoint inhibitor will be added following completion of cohort 3.
