    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Co-regulation of the immune response and the coagulation cascade after infection is thought to be an ancient response to limit pathogen spread. Recently, we showed that activation of the thrombin receptor, protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), on fibroblasts enhanced the innate immune responses to RNA virus infection. Here, we investigated whether PAR1 activation by the extrinsic coagulation pathway contributes to dsRNA-induced innate immune responses in macrophages. Methods: Activation of the type-I interferon (IFN) pathway in the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) from WT and PAR1 -/- was analyzed after dsRNA (poly I:C) and/or PAR-1 stimulation. In addition, innate immune responses in the spleen were analyzed in vivo 4 hours after poly I:C (8mg/kg) injection in mice with reduced tissue factor expression (LowTF) or global PAR1 deletion (PAR1 -/- ) as well as in WT mice with a thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran etexilate, 10g/kg chow) or PAR-1 inhibitor (SCH79797, 25\u03bcg/kg). Lastly, we investigated the innate immune response in the spleen of WT and PAR1 -/- mice after infection with the single-stranded RNA virus coxsackievirus B3. Results: RAW264.7 and BMDM exhibited a toll-like receptor 3 dependent induction of IFN\u03b2 and CXCL10 after poly I:C stimulation. Activation of PAR-1 with either thrombin or agonist peptide enhanced poly I:C induction of IFN\u03b2 and CXCL10. A deficiency of tissue factor levels, thrombin inhibition, PAR-1 inhibition or PAR1 deficiency resulted in reduced expression levels of type-I IFNs and IFN-response genes such as CXCL10 in the spleen and plasma in mice given poly I:C. Last, PAR1 -/- mice exhibited impaired IFN\u03b2 immune response 4 days after coxsackievirus B3 infection compared to WT mice. Conclusion: Our study indicates that the coagulation dependent activation of PAR1 on macrophages is important for anti-viral responses to dsRNA. We speculate that PAR1 inhibition may interfere with anti-viral responses in humans. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
