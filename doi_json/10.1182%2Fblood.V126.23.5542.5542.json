    "abstract_text": "INTRODUCCION EMBT the risk score has been validated in several studies in different types of diseases and modalities of transplantation. The conditions of the patients and the resources available in Latin America are different from those of European centers, so we consider important to validate this scale in our own patients. METHODS EBMT risk scale was validated in 965 of 1176 (750 autologous, allogeneic 426) transplanted from 1993 to 2014; that had all the information available and were not lost to follow up. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank test (p <0.05) were used to estimate the one (OS1) and three (OS3) probabilities of overall survival according to risk groups. RESULTS The mean age was 39.8 (SD 15.5). The median follow-up was 363 days (range: 179-1096) for the whole group. Most frequent diagnoses were Non-hodgkins lymphoma (314: 26.7%) and multiple myeloma (262: 22.22%). 96.3% transplants were performed using peripheral blood stem cells. Most donors were identical siblings; only 19.5% (n = 79) were transplanted before 2004. 81.9% of transplanted patients had 2-4 points on EBMT risk score. Upon analysis it became clear that at 1 and 3 years, two groups were defined: Low (0-3 points) and high (4-7), with a significant difference in overall survival for AML (1 year: p = <0.00; 3 years: p = <0.00) and ALL (1 year: p = 0.04; 3 years: p = 0.01). In NHL 4 risk groups remain significantly different in regards to 1 and 3 years overall survival (1 year: p = 0.04; 3 years: p = 0.02). In patients with diagnosis of MDS EBMT was predictive of survival only significant at one year (p = 0.01). The EBMT score did to delineate risk groups patients with MM, LH, ASMO, or CML in this group. CONCLUSION EBMT score was validated in patients with hematologic malignancies transplanted in a center in Colombia, to our knowledge this is the first validation of this risk score in Latin America.
