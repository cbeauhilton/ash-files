    "abstract_text": "Background: Patients with myelofibrosis (MF) that have failed or are intolerant to JAK inhibitors (JAKi) have no standard treatment options. Tagraxofusp (Elzonris\u2122; SL-401) is a novel targeted therapy directed to the interleukin-3 receptor-\u03b1 (CD123), a target expressed on a variety of malignancies, including certain myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as MF. CD123 is also expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which reside in the tumor microenvironment and may play a role in promoting growth of MPNs and other malignancies. Therefore, targeting of CD123-expressing malignant cells and/or neighboring pDCs may offer a novel therapeutic approach. Tagraxofusp has demonstrated high levels of clinical activity against blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), a CD123+ malignancy derived from pDCs. Methods: This multicenter, two-stage Phase 1/2 trial is enrolling patients with MF that were relapsed, refractory, or unable to tolerate JAKi. Primary objectives include assessment of safety, determining optimal dose/regimen, and evaluating efficacy outcomes. In the Stage 1 dose escalation cohort (completed), tagraxofusp was dosed as a daily IV infusion at 7, 9, and 12 mcg/kg/day, on days 1-3 every 21 days (cycle 1-4), every 28 days (cycles 5-7), and every 42 days (cycles 8+). In Stage 2 (ongoing), patients received the optimal dose determined in Stage 1 (12 mcg/kg/day). Results: As of July 2018, 18 patients with MF received tagraxofusp. Five patients were treated in the second line setting and 12 patients were treated in third-line setting, and beyond. Median age was 69 years (range 55-81); 60% patients were female. Of the 18 patients with DIPSS Plus risk group assessment available, 3 patients (17%) were intermediate-1, 10 patients (55%) were intermediate-2, and 5 patients (28%) were high-risk. Median platelet count was 66 K/uL (range 15-579). 70% (14/20) of patients had baseline platelets <100K/uL, of which 6 patients had platelets <50K/uL at study entry. 89% (17/19) of patients had baseline splenomegaly defined as palpable spleen 5 cm or more below costal margin (BCM) by physical exam. Most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) include hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia (each 27%), and alanine aminotransferase increased, anemia, dizziness, fatigue, headache and nausea (each 20%). Most common \u2265grade 3 TRAEs include anemia (20%) and thrombocytopenia and fatigue (each 7%). Capillary leak syndrome was reported in 1 patient (5%; grade 3). 50% (6/12) of evaluable patients, with baseline spleen size 5 cm or more BCM, had a spleen response, of which 33% (4/12) had splenomegaly reduction by 33% or more and 25% (3/12) had splenomegaly reduction by 35% or more. 50% (3/6) of patients with spleen response had treatment duration 8+ months, including 8+, 12+ and 14+ months (all 3 ongoing). Four patients with baseline thrombocytopenia had treatment durations 8+ months, 3 of which are ongoing. Conclusions: Tagraxofusp monotherapy demonstrated improvements in splenomegaly, with a manageable safety profile, in patients with relapsed/refractory MF, an area of unmet medical need. Given CD123 expression on myeloid neoplastic cells and pDCs in the tumor microenvironment, tagraxofusp may offer a novel targeted approach for MF patients. Enrollment continues, and updated safety and efficacy data will be presented. Registrational designs are being evaluated. Clinical trial information: NCT02268253.
