We have reported that MOZ is essential for hematopoietic cell development and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells. To explore the possibility MORF also plays important roles in hematopoiesis, we generated Morf-deficient mice with homologous recombination methods. Morf\u2212/\u2212 mice were smaller than their wildtype littermates and died within 4 weeks after birth on C57BL/6 background. In MORF\u2212/\u2212 fetal liver, Flt3-negative KSL (c-Kit+ Sca-1+ Lineage-) cells containing hematopoietic stem cells were decreased. When fetal liver cells were transplanted into irradiated recipient mice, MORF\u2212/\u2212 cells less efficiently reconstituted hematopoiesis than wild-type cells. Additionally, bone marrow cells reconstituted with MORF\u2212/\u2212 cells rarely contributed to hematopoiesis in secondary transplants. To reveal relationship between MORF and MOZ in hematopoiesis, we generated double heterozygous (Moz+/\u2212 Morf+/\u2212) mouse. Double heterozygous mice were smaller than wild-type littermates and died at least 4 weeks after birth. Numbers of KSL cells, especially Flt3- KSL cells and common myeloid progenitors were decreased in the double heterozygous embryos. The double heterozygous fetal liver cells also displayed less activity to reconstitute hematopoiesis than MOZ+/\u2212 or MORF+/\u2212 cells. Since MORF\u2212/\u2212 mice and MOZ/MORF double heterozygous mice were alive at adult on a mixed C57BL/6/DBA2 genetic background, we investigated adult hematopoiesis in these mice. MORF\u2212/\u2212 or MOZ/MORF double heterozygous mice were smaller than their wild-type littermates and had small numbers of thymocytes and splenocytes. However, there were no significant differences in number of bone marrow cells and hematopoietic lineage population in MORF\u2212/\u2212 or MOZ/MORF double heterozygous mice. These results suggest that MORF as well as MOZ plays important roles in self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
