    "abstract_text": "Title : The comparision of immune reconstitution after HLA-haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation and HLA-identical sibling Stem Cell Transplantation. Background: HLA-haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation is widely used in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in recent years. Previous studties reported that HLA-haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation(HRD) has comparable GVHD and similar overall survival (OS) to HLA-identical sibling stem cell transplantation(MSD). While the immune reconstruction after transplantation was less studied and the effect of early and successful immunologic reconstitution on transplantation outcome still need further research. Methods : A total of 162 patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent allo-HSCT at Nanfang Hospital between January 2013 and December 2015 were enrolled in the retrospective study. Of the 162patients, 52 cases received HRD, 110 MSD. We sequentially monitored the reconstitution kinetics of CD3+T cells, total CD4+T cells, CD4+CD45RA+ T cells, CD4+CD45RO+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD8+CD45RA+ T cells, CD4+CD25+FOXP3+Treg cells, CD19+ B cells, CD3-CD56+ NK cells in all patients by flow cytometry. Results: Our results showed that in the first 30 days after grafting, counts of T cell subsets (total CD4+ T cells, CD45RA+CD4+ T cells, CD45RO+CD4+ T cells, total CD8+ T cells, CD45RA+CD8+ T cells,CD4+CD25+FOXP3+Treg cells) and CD3-CD56+ NK cell subsets were all signifcantly lower in haploidentical transplant recipients than those of HLA-matched transplant recipients, though no sigificant difference in the counts of B cells in two groups. The total CD8+ T cell numbers expanded dramatically and reach the level of that of HLA-identical recipients at day 90 post transplantation, though CD45RA+CD8+ T cells was still signifcantly lower in haploidentical transplant recipients than those of HLA-matched transplant recipients. Since day 180 post transplantation, CD8+ T cells were signifciantly higher than that of HLA-identical recipients. Conclusion: HLA-haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation show superior CD8+ T cells and NK cells reconstitution than HLA-identical sibling Stem Cell Transplantation, which might be associated with a superior GVL effect compared to MSD for high-risk patients. similar immune reconstitution as HLA-identical sibling Stem Cell Transplantation.
