    "abstract_text": "NK cell immunotherapy shows exciting promise, but inconsistency and variability remain as a significant challenge. Since NK cells comprise a small fraction (\u223c5%) of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell fraction, expansion of NK cells in vivo or ex vivo is a critical requirement to attain therapeutically effective dosages and to observe consistent positive clinical outcomes. Most of currently developed ex vivo expansion protocols depend on co-culture with various engineered and/or cancer derived stimulator/feeder cells to induce the proliferation of NK cells. The use of accessory cells poses significant challenges to clinical transfer. Our laboratory has developed a nanoparticle-based expansion technology that utilizes particles, few hundred nanometers in size, derived from the plasma membrane (PM) of K562 feeder cells expressing IL-15 and 41BBL on their surface (PM-mb15-41BBL). These particles in combination with low concentration of IL-2 induce selective and efficient expansion of NK cells within human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). When PBMC are stimulated with PM-mb15-41BBL over 21 days the NK cell numbers increase exponentially between days 6 and 18 of culture. The numbers of NK cell increased on average 200 fold (range 104-557, n =11, 4 donors) after 12-13 days of culture in the presence of PM-mb15-41BBL particles (at 200 \u00b5g of membrane protein/mL). The expansions with the PM particles are comparable to those in the presence of live feeder cells that gave \u223c200 fold (79-895, n=11, 4 donors). The PM-particle based NK expansion is far better in comparison to NK stimulation with soluble purified 41BBL, IL-15 and IL-2, at matching concentrations, that yielded only 3 fold (1-4, n =6, 3 donors) increase in NK cells. Furthermore, the NK cells expand selectively under these conditions where they initially consisted only about 10% of the population of PBMC isolated from fresh peripheral blood, but increased to more than 95% of the cell suspension after 14 days in culture. The extent of expansion and NK cell content on day 12 of culture was dependent on the concentration of PM particles used with 200 \u00b5g of PM protein/mL being the optimal dose. Thus, PM nanoparticles can expand NK cells as efficiently and selectively as feeder cells. Furthermore, the PM-particle based expansion is more reproducible between trials and with different donors as compared to NK cell expansion induced with feeder cells (coefficient of variation 63% vs. 88%, respectively). The NK cells expanded in presence of PM-particles were highly cytotoxic against several leukemia cell lines and also against patient derived AML blasts. Expanded NK cells were 4 to 9 times more potent against AML cell lines K562, KG1 and HL-60 as compared to freshly isolated NK cells that were pre-activated with a high dose of IL-2. The PM-particle expanded NK cells also were selectively cytotoxic where they efficiently killed patient derived CD34 + leukemia blasts while sparing healthy CD34 - peripheral blood cells. The expanded NK cells were observed to have an increase in the expression of major activating receptors such as NKG2D, NKp44, NKp30 and of the death receptor ligand FasL. This expression difference corresponds well with the activated cytotoxic phenotype and is likely responsible for their increased cytotoxicity against AML cells. Pilot trials in NSG mice are currently ongoing. Disclosures: Solh: Celgene: Speakers Bureau."
