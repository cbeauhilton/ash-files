    "abstract_text": "We are studying the development of HCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in pediatric patients. A new technique was developed to simultaneously detect HCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells using HCMV-infected autologous dendritic cells as stimulators and intracellular staining of IFN-\u03b3 production by T cells. This prospective study is based on monthly determination of both HCMV-specific T cell number and in vitro lymphoproliferative response to crude HCMV antigen. Patients are routinely monitored for HCMV infection/reactivation in blood (by determination of either antigenemia or quantitation of viral DNA) and treated according to a strategy of pre-emptive therapy. So far, of 41 patients receiving HSCT from an HLA-identical related donor (n=18), unrelated donor (n=15) or a T cell-depleted HSCT from a haploidentical relative (n=8), 25 patients have reached day +180, while 16 patients completed a follow-up of 90 days. Among the 28 HCMV-seropositive HSCT recipients, 25 developed HCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response within the first 60 days after transplantation. In these patients, absolute CD4+ T cell count increased over time, but remained lower than that of healthy controls also at later time points. By contrast, CD8+ T cells reached and maintained absolute levels comparable to those of controls already from day +60. At this time, HCMV-specific CD4+ T cell count was comparable to that of controls, while HCMV-specific CD8+ T cell count was higher than that of controls, with no significant change thereafter. On the other hand, in vitro lymphoproliferative response to HCMV antigen was detectable only in about one half of these patients, even at day +180. HCMV infection was detected in blood of 22 of the 25 patients in whom HCMV-specific T cells were present. It was either self-limiting (n=14) or in 8 patients required shorter ganciclovir course (median 7 days, range 5-14) than in the 3 HCMV seropositive patients who developed HCMV infection in the absence of specific immunity (median 67 days, range 42\u201382, p<0.001). No patient developed HCMV disease or late viral infections. Conversely, HCMV-specific response was detected in only 3/13 HCMV seronegative recipients (none of whom developing detectable HCMV infection in blood). In these patients, both absolute and HCMV-specific T cell counts were lower than those of both controls and HCMV-seropositive HSCT recipients. Our data suggest that effective HCMV-specific T cell immunity can promptly develop after HSCT (regardless of donor type or T-cell depletion of the graft), particularly in seropositive recipients in whom latent virus may be a major antigenic drive for rapid reconstitution of T cell compartment, especially of CD8+ lymphocytes. On the other hand, transfer of memory T cell immunity from seropositive donors to seronegative recipients does not appear to be always sufficient to permit detection of virus-specific lymphocytes in patient\u2019s peripheral blood in the early period after the allograft, possibly also due to the lower chance of in vivo antigen stimulation. The frequent dissociation between IFN-\u03b3 production and lymphoproliferative response remains to be explained. Future studies could address modulation of antiviral intervention on the reconstitution of HCMV-specific T cell immune response.",
