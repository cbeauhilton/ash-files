    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2757 MCL is typically characterized by an aggressive clinical course and inevitable development of refractory disease despite early intervention that often includes: immunotherapy (e.g., rituximab), multi-agent induction chemotherapy and consolidation with high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant in first remission. Residual disease at the time of stem cell collection is an important cause for treatment failure. There is a need to evaluate more potent anti-CD20 mAbs capable to kill lymphoma cells with low CD20 surface levels. In Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) pre-clinical models we previously demonstrated that OFA was more potent than rituximab (RIT) in vitro and in vivo. In order to characterize the activity of OFA against MCL, we evaluated the activity of OFA against cytarabine (Ara-C)-sensitive (eg. Mino, Jeko-1, Rec-1, HBL-2, Granta and Z-138); \u2013resistant MCL cell lines (eg. MinoAraCR, Jeko-1AraCR, Rec-1AraCR, HBL-2AraCR and GrantaAraCR); and primary tumor cells derived from MCL patients (n=2). Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) were measured by standard 51 Cr release assays in MCL exposed to OFA, RIT or isotype control. OFA vs. RIT direct anti-proliferative effects were measured in by alamar blue reduction assay. Apoptosis following in vitro exposure to OFA or RIT was detected by caspase 3/PARP cleavage. Patient tumor cells were isolated from biopsy specimens by negative selection using magnetic beads and incubated with OFA or RIT +/\u2212 human serum as a complement source. Cell viability was determined at 48 hours by CellTiterGlo assay. Surface CD20 and the complement inhibitory proteins (CIPs) (CD55 and CD59) density in MCL cell lines was determined by flow cytometry (Image stream) and compared to BL or DLBCL cell lines. For in vivo experiments 6\u20138 week-old SID mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 5\u00d710 6 matrigel suspended Z-138 cells. Upon tumor engraftment, mice were assigned to RIT (10mg/kg), OFA (10mg/kg) or control groups. Tumor growth curves were calculated for each group. Mice were sacrificed if tumor size reached >2cm in any dimension. After 6 months, survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared by log-rank test. OFA induced significantly higher levels of CDC associated cell lysis compared to RIT in almost all MCL cell lines tested (10/11) (Mino: 53.2% vs 0.2%; MinoAraCR: 72.6% vs. 0.6%; Jeko-1: 33.4% vs. 9.8%; Jeko-1AraCR: 38.3% vs. 2.8%; REC-1: 17% vs 3%; Rec-1AraCR: 7.8% vs. 0.2%; HBL-2: 27.1% vs. 19.2%; HBL-2AraCR: 86.6% vs. 72.2%; GrantaAraCR: 17% vs 0.9%; Z-138: 56.4% vs. 0.65%; all p-values <0.05). No differences in RIT or OFA mediated ADCC or direct signaling was observed. As previously noted in BL and DLBCL models, OFA was capable of inducing a higher degree of CMC even at low CD20 levels in contrast to RIT. In vivo, OFA slowed tumor growth, and prolonged survival in Z-138 bearing SCID mice compared to RIT (median survival for RIT was 127 days vs. not reached for OFA treated animals; p<0.05). Our data suggest that, OFA is more potent than RIT against Ara-C-sensitive and \u2013resistant MCL cells in vitro , delays tumor growth and prolongs survival compared to RIT in an in vivo MCL SCID mouse model, and retains CDC activity despite low CD20 and high CIP surface expression levels. OFA appears to be a promising mAb targeting CD20 in MCL and is undergoing clinical testing in the front-line setting ( NCT01527149 ).
