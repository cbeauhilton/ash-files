    "abstract_text": "Pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease (SCD), including acute chest syndrome, pulmonary hypertension (PH) and pulmonary fibrosis, are common. Dyspnea and hypoxemia are equally common in this population. It is likely that pulmonary function tests (PFT) are abnormal in the SCD population, however, no extensive study has been reported to date. Moreover, the relationship between abnormal pulmonary function and other manifestations of SCD, such as PH, is unclear. We hypothesized that abnormalities of pulmonary function, particularly a low diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), may be associated with other complications of SCD. The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) enrolled and followed more than 4,000 SCD patients who had visited one of 23 participating clinical centers across the United States between 1978 and 1998. Data were collected on many complications of the disease, and standardized collection of PFTs were part of the protocol. From the more than 1300 CSSCD patients who had the results of PFTs recorded, 310 adults (age\u2265 20 years of age) homozygous for the Hb S gene without coincident \u03b1 thalassemia and with sufficient data were identified. Predicted values for FEV 1 , FVC, FEV 1 /FVC, TLC, RV and DL CO were calculated using algorithms that accounted for gender, age, and height in the African American population (using STATA, version 9); data are presented as percent predicted. Based on criteria established by the American Thoracic Society, subjects were sub-classified into 7 groups: obstructive physiology; restrictive physiology; mixed obstructive/restrictive disease; low lung volumes with normal spirometry (LLV); LLV with a low DL CO , isolated low DL CO , or normal. The association of blood counts and serum chemistries between patients with low DL CO compared with those with a normal DL CO was assessed by multivariate linear regression (using SAS software version 8.2). Normal PFTs were present in only 31 of 310 (10 %) SCD patients. Overall, the adult SCD population was characterized by decreased total lung capacities (70.2 + 14.7% predicted) and DL CO (64.5 + 19.9 % predicted adjusted for hemoglobin concentration). The most common PFT patterns observed were restrictive physiology (35.8%), LLV with normal spirometry (34.2% of patients), and an isolated low DL CO (12.9%). The presence of a low DL CO was associated with an elevated platelet count (p=0.05), hepatic dysfunction [elevated ALT (p=0.07) with elevated AST (p=0.01)] and renal dysfunction [elevated BUN and creatinine (p=0.05, 0.07)]. Restrictive disease is marginally associated with a decrease in hematocrit (p=0.07) and Hb F levels (p=0.07). Pulmonary function is abnormal in 90% of adult SCD patients. Common abnormalities include restrictive physiology, LLV with normal spirometry and a decreased DL CO . The presence of a decreased DL CO may be a marker of more severe systemic disease that includes impaired renal and hepatic function and possibly complications of hemolytic anemia such as PH.",
