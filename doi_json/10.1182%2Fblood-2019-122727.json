    "abstract_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a 20A>T mutation in the \u03b2-globin gene. State-of-the-art genome editing technologies have the potential to correct the SCD mutation in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), producing adult hemoglobin (Hb) while simultaneously eliminating sickle Hb. We have demonstrated efficient gene correction in SCD CD34+ cells with SCD mutation-specific guide RNA, Cas9 mRNA/protein, and single strand donor DNA, resulting in ~30% gene correction and ~50% indels at the DNA level, and ~60% normal \u03b2-globin production at the protein level in in vitro erythroid differentiation (ASH 2018). Gene correction by homology directed repair is thought to be enhanced by cell proliferation; however, cell proliferation might reduce stemness of HSCs. To investigate this hypothesis, we sought to evaluate engraftment of gene-edited CD34+ HSCs in a non-human primate model. To model SCD gene correction, a \u03b2-to-\u03b2s globin conversion was designed in rhesus macaques. Mobilized rhesus CD34+ cells (n=2) were electroporated using the GMP-compliant, FDA Master File-supported, and scalable MaxCyte GT System to deliver rhesus \u03b2-globin-targeting guide RNA (the same target site as the SCD mutation-specific guide RNA), SpCas9 protein, and single strand donor DNA including a SCD mutation (20A>T). We also added an adjuvant to improve gene conversion efficiencies. Following erythroid differentiation, gene correction efficiency was evaluated at DNA levels by deep sequencing and at protein levels by reverse-phase HPLC. We observed high-efficiency genome editing without the adjuvant (20-30% gene conversion and 61-64% indels), and further enhanced genome editing with the adjuvant (51-59% gene conversion and 36-39% indels). After erythroid differentiation, we observed production of \u03b2s-globin protein (~100%) but not normal \u03b2-globin in gene-edited cells. We then evaluated engraftment of gene-edited rhesus CD34+ cells with \u03b2-to-\u03b2s globin conversion (n=2, 13U005 and 12U011). Mobilized rhesus CD34+ cells (3.4-3.8e7) were pre-stimulated for 2 days, and edited cells were cryopreserved after electroporation with editing tools. Small aliquots of edited cells (before and after cryopreservation) were differentiated into erythroid cells in vitro , resulting in 17-26% of gene conversion and 57-71% of indels at the DNA level and 50-100% of \u03b2-globin production at the protein level, with no difference observed between aliquots taken before and after cryopreservation. Following 9.5 Gy total body irradiation, the frozen edited CD34+ cells (1.6-2.2e7) were injected into autologous macaques. We observed robust recovery of blood counts in 13U005, while peripheral blood recovery was delayed in 12U011, who was supported by serial whole blood transfusion. We observed 7-11% of gene conversion and 44-54% of indels in both granulates and lymphocytes in 13U005 1 month post-transplant. Around 15% sickle Hb production in red blood cells was detected by Hb electrophoresis in 13U005 three months post-transplant and ~7% in 12U011 two months post-transplant. Interestingly, ~10% of fetal Hb production was observed in 12U001, likely due to stress hematopoiesis. In summary, we developed a rhesus \u03b2-to-\u03b2s globin conversion model with HSC-targeted genome editing strategies. The gene-edited rhesus CD34+ cells are engraftable for at least 3 months post-transplant. Although further follow-up is necessary for transplanted animals, these findings are helpful in designing HSC-targeted gene correction trials.
