    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1216 Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) begins as an indolent chronic-phase (CP) when a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expresses BCR-ABL, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase generated by the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) ( i.e. Philadelphia chromosome, Ph ). At this phase, BCR-ABL confers a proliferative/survival advantage to CD34 + /CD38 - primitive HSCs without affecting their multi-lineage capacity, as CD34 + /CD38 + committed myeloid precursors (CMPs) are expanded but all BCR-ABL + blood cells differentiate and function normally. Moreover, tyrosine kinase inhibitors of BCR-ABL ( i.e. , imatinib mesylate or dasatinib) induce durable remission in CML CP patients but do not eradicate leukemia-initiating cells, which therefore represent a reservoir of disease and potential source of relapse if therapy is stopped or discontinued. These findings strengthen the importance of unravelling HSC mechanisms that control early events on BCR-ABL + leukemogenesis and therapy-responsiveness of primitive leukemic progenitors, being likely dictated not only by the BCR-ABL itself, but also by the specific HSC microenvironment that the oncogene targets. Here, we focus on glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), a nutrient-responsive kinase that is mainly regulated by serine (inhibitory) and tyrosine (stimulatory) phosphorylation in normal HSCs. It is known that GSK-3\u03b2 plays multifaceted roles in haematopoiesis, by suppressing WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway responsible for HSC maintenance on the one hand, or by promoting HSC survival and self-renewal through NF-kB activation on the other. Emerging evidence indicates GSK-3\u03b2 targeting as an effective therapeutic approach in MLL leukemia, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, and administration of GSK3\u03b2 inhibitors in vivo as a clinical means to augment the repopulating capacity of normal HSCs. We here describe balanced levels of transient inactive/active forms of GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylated at both serine 9 (Ser 9 ) and tyrosine 216 (Y 216 ) in normal CD34 + cells versus constitutive levels of active GSK-3\u03b2 phospho-Y 216 in total CD34 + cells and more primitive CD34 + CD38 - progenitors (<5% of total CD34 + cells) freshly-isolated from CML CP patients. Low or undetectable levels of GSK-3\u03b2 phospho-Ser 9 in primary BCR-ABL + progenitors indicated that the kinase could be no longer regulated physiologically ( e.g. defective inactivation). Imatinib 1mM, corresponding to plasma levels achieved in treated CML CP patients, effectively inhibited BCR-ABL kinase activity but enhanced GSK-3\u03b2 phospho-Y 216 without affecting total GSK-3\u03b2 expression. Interestingly, increased GSK-3\u03b2 phospho-Y 216 correlated with up-regulated levels of active MAPK kinases in imatinib-treated CML progenitors, as part of a compensatory response induced by exogenous growth factor (GF)-stimulation for maintaining HSC viability. Indeed, imatinib did not change and, however, failed to increase GSK-3\u03b2 phospho-Y 216 in GF-starved CML CP progenitors. Immunofluorescence microscopy was then performed to test changes on the subcellular distribution of GSK-3\u03b2 in response to BCR-ABL or cytokine stimulation. In normal CD34 + cells depleted of exogenous growth factors, GSK-3\u03b2 was located predominantly in the cytoplasm, and 2h exposure to GF promoted its nuclear localization. In contrast, CML CD34 + cells showed a cytosolic retention of GSK-3\u03b2 in presence of GF. By using imatinib (as a selective ABL inhibitor) and dasatinib (as a dual SRC/ABL inhibitor), we showed that CML progenitors can finely integrate oncogenic (BCR-ABL-dependent) and physiological survival signals ( via GF-receptor engagement of SRC kinases), to control GSK-3\u03b2 phospho-Y 216 , its subcellular distribution and signalling impact on downstream regulators of HSC maintenance (C/EBP\u03b1 and p27), HSC viability (pp60 SRC ) and autophagy induction (mTOR). More importantly, our data point at therapeutic targeting of GSK-3\u03b2 activity by SB-216763 combined with imatinib to strongly increase apoptosis in primary CML CD34 + cells resistant to the elimination by imatinib alone, while sparing normal HSCs. To sum up, this work gains new insights in the biology of primary BCR/ABL + progenitors and earmarks GSK-3\u03b2 as an attractive therapeutic target to overcome imatinib resistance in CML CP patients.
