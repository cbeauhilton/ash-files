    "abstract_text": "The NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) initiates neddylation, the cascade of post-translational conjugation of NEDD8 onto target proteins. Cullin proteins are major substrates of the neddylation pathway, and are involved in diverse cellular processes. MLN4924, a selective NAE inhibitor, has displayed preclinical anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo, and promising clinical activity has been reported in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies. Here, we sought to understand the mechanisms of resistance to MLN4924 in leukemic cells. MLN4924 shows potent activity in K562 human leukemia cells (EC 50 = 100 nM). In contrast, by exposing K562 cells to increasing concentrations of MLN4924 over 6 months, we selected a population of cells resistant to MLN4924 (R-K562 MLN ; EC 50 > 2 \u00b5M). R-K562 MLN cells proliferated similarly to parental K562 cells, and remained resistant to MLN4924 even after culturing in the absence of MLN4924 for 5 weeks. Compared to parental cells, R-K562 MLN cells were similarly sensitive to a broad spectrum of chemotherapeutic drugs, including daunorubicin, a classical substrate of the multidrug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. Thus, the mechanism of resistance to MLN4924 did not appear to be related to generalized multidrug efflux. While basal levels of NEDD8-conjugated cullin proteins were equivalent in parental and resistant cells, NEDD8-cullins were diminished in parental cells treated with 25 nM MLN4924. In contrast, no appreciable reduction in NEDD8-cullins was observed in R-K562 MLN cells after treatment with up to 250 nM MLN4924. However, knockdown of NEDD8 by shRNA was cytotoxic to R-K562 MLN cells, suggesting that NEDD8 conjugation remains essential for the survival of resistant cells. To further probe mechanisms of MLN4924 resistance in these cells, we sequenced the coding region of the NAE catalytic subunit UBA3 from K562 and R-K562 MLN cells, and identified a mutation in codon 310 [ATT (Isoleucine, I) > AAT (Asparagine, N)] in R-K562 MLN cells. Biochemical analyses using recombinant wild-type and I310N NAE complexes indicated that the I310N mutation alters biochemical properties of the NAE, increasing the enzyme\u2019s affinity for ATP while decreasing its affinity for NEDD8. The I310N NAE complex was \u223c7-fold less sensitive to MLN4924 (IC 50 = 225 nM) compared to wild-type NAE (IC 50 = 32 nM), providing a mechanistic basis for MLN4924 resistance in R-K562 MLN cells through the UBA3 I310N mutation. To investigate whether another malignant leukemic cell line employs a similar on-target resistance mechanism, we similarly selected a population of U937 cells resistant to MLN4924 (R-U937 MLN ). Parental U937 cells were sensitive to MLN4924 (EC 50 = 25 nM), while R-U937 MLN cells were more than 40-fold more resistant (EC 50 > 1 \u00b5M). Sequencing of the coding region of UBA3 in U937 and R-U937 MLN cells revealed a point mutation in codon 352 [TAT (Tyrosine, Y) > CAT (Histidine, H)] only in R-U937 MLN cells. As for the UBA3 I301N mutation, the Y352H mutation conferred a \u223c10-fold decrease in the sensitivity of the NAE to MLN4924 (IC 50 = 138.5 nM and 13 nM for Y352H and wild-type, respectively) through decreased NEDD8 and increased ATP affinities. These findings suggest that the Y352H mutation, like I310N, is sufficient to provide MLN4924 resistance in leukemia cells while sustaining adequate NAE function for leukemic cell survival. We next found that R-K562 MLN cells were cross-resistant to other NAE-selective inhibitors derived from Compound 1, a pan-E1 inhibitor. Nevertheless, compared to parental cells, R-K562 MLN cells were not refractory to Compound 1 (EC 50 = 27 nM and 81 nM, respectively). The cytotoxicity of Compound 1 towards MLN4924-resistant cells might be explained by its inhibition of other E1 enzymes. Indeed, Compound 1 diminished the abundance of ubiquitinated proteins in R-K562 MLN cells similarly to its effects in K562 cells, while NEDD8-cullins in the MLN4924-resistant cells were unaffected. Overall, as MLN4924 continues to be evaluated clinically, our work provides insight into the mechanisms of MLN4924 resistance, which may facilitate the development of more effective second-generation NAE inhibitors.
