    "abstract_text": "Background: Although neuropathies complicating multiple myeloma (MM) are common as a result of medications and spinal cord compression, neuropathy as a consequence of cross reactivity between the paraprotein and neural tissues is rare. In CANOMAD syndrome (chronic ataxic neuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, M-protein, agglutination, anti-disialosyl antibodies) IgM paraproteins with shared reactivity between Campylocacter jejuni lipopolysaccharides and human peripheral nerve disialylated gangliosides including GQ1b have been described. In POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin changes) cerebral spinal fluid concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may be markedly elevated, similar to other inflammatory polyneuropathies. Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy yielding flaccid areflexic paralysis that, to our knowledge, has only been reported once as a complication of MM. Case reports: At Hackensack University Medical Center we have observed 5 cases of GBS complicating MM since 2002 (approximate incidence <0.5%). Details are described below. In all five cases, blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures, anti-GQb1, anti-GM1, and anti-MAG antibodies were negative and radiographic imaging including computerized axial tomographic scan (CT) of the head and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were unrevealing. In four patients cerebrospinal fluid examination showed albumin/cytologic dissociation. Conclusions: Our observation represents the first series of patients with GBS complicating MM, and suggests that GBS, although rare, should be considered as part of the neurologic complications of plasma cell dyscrasias.
