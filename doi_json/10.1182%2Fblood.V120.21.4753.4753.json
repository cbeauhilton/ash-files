The degree to which jaundice impacts the daily lives of patients with SCA has not been previously described. This study aims to assess the effect of jaundice on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of adults living with SCA. Methods This study was a cross-sectional survey of patients with SCA. A convenience sample of patients age > 17 years with SCA were approached during routine clinic visits to Parkland Memorial Hospital or UT Southwestern University Hospitals. Consenting patients completed a 15 question survey instrument. The survey was divided into three subscales (personal, relational, and behavioral) where individual items were presented in a 5-point Likert scale. This instrument was reviewed by non-study hematologists, nurses and patients for face validity. No other assessment of reliability or validity was performed. Additional data collected included serum total bilirubin (TB), hemoglobin, reticulocyte count (%) and patient self-report of current treatment for SCA (hydroxyurea [HU], chronic blood transfusions, or other). We tested for associations between survey subscales and TB, reticulocyte count, or hemoglobin using Spearman correlation coefficients. We compared the Spearman correlations of the survey subscales and TB between treatment and non-treatment groups using the Fisher's z transformation. Gender and age adjustments were made using linear regression. TB was transformed by natural log for regression analysis. Results We surveyed 100 subjects (58% female) with SCA. The median age was 25 years (range: 18\u201363), and the median TB was 2.5 mg/dL (range: 0.4\u201313.8). Nearly half of patients reported receiving treatment with 28% on HU and 14% on chronic transfusions. The majority of patients reported a history of jaundice, with 79% listing responses of \u2018sometimes\u2019, \u2018often\u2019, or \u2018always\u2019. Summary results for the remainder of the survey are listed in the table. TB was positively correlated with the 3 subscales (personal, r=0.32, p=0.002; relational, r=0.38, p=0.0002; behavioral, r=0.31, p=0.003). We compared these correlations between \u2018treatment\u2019 and \u2018no treatment\u2019 groups and observed strong correlations in the \u2018no treatment\u2019 group (personal, r=0.55, p<0.0001; relational, r=0.63, p<0.0001; behavioral, r=0.52, p=0.0002). TB was not correlated with the subscales in the \u2018treatment\u2019 group. After adjusting for age, gender, and disease-modifying therapy, the three subscales were associated with TB (personal, \u03b2 = 0.066, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [0.027, 0.104], p=0.001; relational, \u03b2 = 0.061, 95% CI [0.031, 0.092], p=0.0001; behavioral, \u03b2 = 0.104, 95% CI [0.045, 0.164], p=0.0009). Conclusion Jaundice negatively impacts the lives of many adults with SCA. The personal and relational subscales suggest more impact on the self-image of respondents, but only a few reported behavioral changes. The impact of jaundice appears to be mitigated by disease-modifying therapy for SCA (HU or chronic transfusions); however, this study was not created to determine the effectiveness of these reported treatments. Despite the fact this instrument was not validated, our study results suggest jaundice should be well-represented in HRQOL assessment tools in adults with SCA. Moreover, prospective studies are needed to clarify potential benefits of disease-modifying therapies, particularly HU, on the burden of jaundice in SCA. Table - Jaundice Survey  Subscales . Items .
