    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5051 While clinical studies and guidelines provide important data regarding the safety and efficacy of new drugs, their application to daily practice can be limited by the inclusion of selected patient populations. Population-based studies can provide additional insight into the complex process of implementing treatment guidelines in daily practice. The objective of the MyDyS registry was to collect and analyze data regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in Slovakia. Material and methods: five clinical centers collected data regarding demographics, staging, history and cytopathology from newly diagnosed patients (pts) with MDS from 2009 to 2011. Patients were classified according to the French American British (FAB) and World Health Organization (WHO) systems and the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). The database allowed online pts registration. Results: one hundred thirty pts were registered to MyDyS in the yrs 2009\u20132011 and data from 128 pts were analyzed. Male/ female: 53,1%/ 46.9%; average age 64,8 yrs (range 22\u201389 yrs). The most frequent diagnosis according to FAB classification was RA (53.9%) and RAEB (21.9%), and according to WHO classification RCMD (27,3%) and RAEB II (22,7%). IPSS Low risk was in 16,4% pts, INT-1 in 43%, INT-2 in 19,5% and High risk in 11,7%. The majority of pts were de novo (89,8%). Patients with secondary MDS (10,2%) had a history of malignancy (breast cancer, 23,1%; hematologic malignancy, 2,6% only) and history of combination chemo and radiation therapy in 61,5%. In these pts, bone marrow (BM) was hypercellular in 49,2%, hypocellular in 24,2% of patients. Number of blasts less than 5% in 60,2% patients. Erythroid dysplasia was observed in 88,3%, myeloid dysplasia in 56,3% and dysplasia of megakaryocytes in 71,9% of patients. BM biopsy was performed at diagnosis in 87,5% and reported as hypercellular in 56,6%, with fibrosis in 62,8% and abnormal localization of precursors (ALIP) in 8%. Peripheral cytopenia in 2\u20133 lineages was observed in 67,2% pts. Growth factor therapy was given to 63 pts and red blood cell transfusions (average 20,7; range 2\u201380 RBC units) were given to 35 patients. Deferasirox (mostly 1500mg/ d) was given to 25 patients, and serum ferritin level decreased after 8 months in 27,3% pts, after 12 months in 57,4% pts. Chelation therapy was associated with gastrointestinal intolerance in 1 case, and skin reaction in 2 patients. Conclusion: The presented data document the first steps in the complex process of improvement of management of MDS in daily clinical practice in Slovakia. Expansion of the registry is necessary for determination of best practices for discussion with health care authorities and health insurance institutions.
