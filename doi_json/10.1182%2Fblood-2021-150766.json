    "abstract_text": "Background : The development of new genetic profiling techniques such as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) have helped to unravel the genomic landscape of a large number of hematological diseases. In acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), many mutations have been found at diagnosis or during the course of the disease, either alone or in combination. Nevertheless, the clinical significance of most of them has not been well established. That is particularly true regarding infrequent gene mutations and their co-mutations as they are underrepresented in most case series that have been analyzed so far. The big data platform of HARMONY alliance provides the excellent basis for addressing this problem as it assimilates clinical and genomic information about AML patients from over 100 organisations in 18 European countries comprising more than 5000 patients. Anonymised and harmonized using OMOP standards, data collected in HARMONY are optimal for studying the impact of gene-gene-interactions overcoming differences related to data providers. Aims: To identify clinically significant genetic patterns of 2 or more concurrent mutations using the Harmony alliance AML database Methods: From the HARMONY alliance database, we selected ~3600 AML patients with NGS molecular panel analysis. We first performed survival analysis between each gene combination and then we rendered those with statistically significant differences in one easy-to-read graph using the Gephi platform (Fig. A). We then highlighted promising or unexpected associations and analyzed them one by one in greater detail. Finally, these results were validated on an independent cohort. Results: We found that the co-mutation of RAD21 ( RAD21 mut ) in DNMT3A mutated ( DNMT3A mut ) AML impacted outcome compared to DNMT3A mut alone patients (Fig. B, 3-year survival, 81% vs 52%, p=0.016). However, this effect was exclusively seen in allogeneic transplant recipients. In order to identify possible bias that could be generated if RAD21 mut were associated with other well-known favorable prognosis mutations, we compared the frequency of each mutation in our DNMT3A mut / RAD21 mut subgroup with the global AML cohort. NPM1 co-mutation was more frequent in the DNMT3A mut / RAD21 mut group (Fig. C 3, 84% of patients with NPM1 mutation ( NPM1 mut ) vs 26% in the global cohort), potentially explaining the higher survival. Next, we tried to isolate the positive effect of NPM1 on outcome by comparing DNMT3A mut / NPM1 mut patients with and without the RAD21 co-mutation. This analysis showed a favorable outcome only in RAD21 mut patients compared to RAD21 wildtype (Fig. D, 3-year survival, 83% in RAD21 mut / DNMT3A mut / NPM1 mut vs 50% in DNMT3A mut / NPM1 mut with RAD21 wildtype , p=0.016), one more time only in allogeneic transplant recipients. Finally in order to validate our results we reproduced this study from the beginning using an independent cohort of 3125 AML patients. The Gephi graph confirmed an association of DNMT3A mut / RAD21 mut patients with better survival over DNMT3A alone (3 year-survival, 75% vs 37%, p<0.001). NPM1 co-mutation was again more frequent in the good prognosis group (76% vs 27%) but comparing RAD21 mut / DNMT3A mut / NPM1 mut patients with DNMT3A mut / NPM1 mut alone still revealed good prognosis to be related with RAD21 mut (3 year-survival, 87.5% in patients with RAD21 mut vs 38% with RAD21 wildtype , p<0.001). Conclusions: Using the HARMONY alliance database we tested for potential gene co-mutations in AML patients, often very infrequently represented in other studies. Our data suggest that RAD21 mut has a positive effect on outcome in patients receiving an allogeneic transplant with concurrent mutation of DNMT3A and NPM1 . Even though NPM1 mut is much more frequent in the DNMT3A mut / RAD21 mut group, its association with favourable outcome seems to depend on the presence of an additional RAD21 mut Keywords: AML , gene combinations, RAD21, DNMT3A, NPM1, HARMONY, big data.
