    "abstract_text": "Background: There is very little published epidemiological data from developing countries regarding ITP and no large series from India. The aim of the study was to analyze the presenting features, response to different therapeutic options and suggest cost effective therapy. Method: The records of hematology department of All India Institute Of Medical Science were analyzed from January 1992 to June 2004. This is a premium tertiary care hospital in India. Diagnosis of ITP was made according to the standard criteria. Response criteria: complete response was defined as a platelet count increase to 100x10 9 /l or more, for at least 2 months: partial response was defined as doubling of platelet counts from initial levels and > 50x 10 9 /l for at least 2 months; no response included none of the above. Statistical methods: Database was created in MS Access and SPSS ver 11 was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated and appropriate tests of significance like Chi Square, repeated measure linear model were carried out. Results: During the study period, 1230 patients of ITP were seen in hematology department, with a median age of 19.6 years (range 0.9\u201380). Females were 51.1% and males 48.9%. Median follow-up was of 9 months (range 0\u2013178). Presenting features were: skin bleed \u2212 91.1%; mucosal bleed \u2212 57.5%; hematuria \u2212 7.2%; gastrointestinal bleed \u2212 12.5% and intracraniall bleed \u2212 2.8%. Per-vaginal bleeding \u2212 31.2 % of females. History of preceding viral fever was seen in 13.1% and palpable spleen in 2.5%. The mean platelet counts at presentation were 34+ 18.3x10 9 /l. There were 595 (48.4%) patients of acute ITP and 635 (51.6%) patients of chronic ITP. Childhood ITP (age \u2264 12 yr) was seen in 46.5% and adult ITP in 53.5%. Response to therapy: Prednisolone was given to 99.6% patients with response of 57.3 %; Intravenous gamma globulin was given to 8.9% with response in 63.6%. Splenectomy was performed in 5% of acute ITP and 15.1% of chronic ITP (p = 0.00). The overall number of splenectomies was 126, with a response rate of 83.3%. Of these 126, acute ITP constituted 23.8% while chronic ITP formed 76.2% of cases. There was no statistically significant difference in response rate in these two groups (p =0.575). Danazole was given to 66 patients with response in 44%. Various other modalities of treatment were given to 24 patients (Anti D-14; Dapsone-2; Cyclosporin-2; Azathioprine-5; and Vincristine with Cyclophosphamide -1 patient), with a response in 25% of patients. The overall response rate with all treatment modalities was 68%: in childhood ITP \u2212 65% and in adult ITP \u2212 70.5%. Childhood ITP did not respond as expected, possibly due to referral bias of more refractory cases being referred to the center. The values of platelets showed a continuous increase during follow up and this increase was statistically significant (P=0.000 for all, Repeated measure model). Conclusion: Pattern of ITP in India is similar to that seen in other centers. In this study Prednisolone was given as first line agent to almost all patients with response in 57.3%; Splenectomy were done in 10.2% of prednisolone refractory or dependent patients with a response in 83.3%. These should form the primary modalities of therapy in developing countries. Significant numbers of patients were refractory to above-mentioned modalities and thus there is a requirement for other cost-effective therapies.",
