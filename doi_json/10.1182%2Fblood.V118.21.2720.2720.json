    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2720 The PI3K pathway is constitutively active in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL). PI3K pathway targeted therapies have focused on inhibiting mTORC1 (rapalogs) with a \u223c20\u201348% response rate due to inactivation of mTORC1 resulting in G1 cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. A mechanism of resistance to rapalogs is that mTORC2 is unaffected resulting in undesirable Akt activation. Strategies to block Akt up-regulation require novel agents that simultaneously block PI3K, mTORC1 and mTORC2. SF1126 is a novel pan-PI3K/mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor conjugated to an integrin targeted peptide RGD with potent anti-tumor activity in multiple solid tumor types. Here, we demonstrated SF1126 had potent anti-B-NHL activity and is superior to CAL-101 a PI3K delta-isoform specific inhibitor in a panel of aggressive B-NHL cell lines. Cells treated with SF1126 exhibited >90% decrease in pAkt and pGSK-3\u03b2 confirming the mechanism of action of a pan-PI3K inhibitor. Moreover, SF1126 induced apoptosis in a dose and time dependent manner confirmed by flow cytometry, PARP cleavage and with an IC 50 < 4\u03bcM. In contrast, CAL-101 was less active compared to SF1126 in inducing apoptosis (12% versus 25% in SUDHL-4 and 15% versus 23% in TMD-8) and cell proliferation (5.62\u03bcM versus 3.28\u03bcM SUDHL-4 and 5.31\u03bcM versus 1.47\u03bcM in TMD-8). SF1126 induced G1 cell cycle arrest at 2\u03bcM which contributes to suppression of cell proliferation. The cell cycle protein cyclin D1 is downstream of mTORC1, and the over-expression of cyclin D1 is a hallmark of mantle cell NHL (MCL). Consistent with this, cyclin D1 was significantly decreased by SF1126 compared to CAL-101. Lastly, the addition of Rituximab to SF1126 or CAL101 increased the apoptosis over single agent therapy in B-NHL cell lines. In conclusion, we demonstrate that SF1126 potently inhibits the constitutively activated PI3K/mTORC/Akt pathway in aggressive B-cell NHL cell lines with consequent suppressive effects on cell cycle progression, cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. These findings provide a rationale for SF1126 in combination with rituximab as a novel therapeutic strategy for aggressive B-NHL and warrant early phase clinical trial evaluation [ Funded by the Lymphoma SPORE 1 P50 CA 130805 01A1 ].
