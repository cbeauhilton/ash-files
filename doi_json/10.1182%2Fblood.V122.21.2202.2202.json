    "abstract_text": "Introduction Anemia is a common feature at diagnosis of patients with lymphoid malignancies and has been previously described as an important prognostic factor (Moullet et al. Ann Oncol 1998). Recent guidelines recommend evaluating iron parameters as part of the initial assessment of cancer associated anemia in order to propose iron therapy for patients with functional or absolute iron deficiency. However, incidence of iron parameters abnormalities and impact on prognosis is largely unknown. Methods The phase III randomized LNH 03-6B protocol included elderly patients from 60 to 80-year with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and an age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (aaIPI) of 1 or more. Patients were randomized between 8 cycles of R-CHOP given every 2 or 3 weeks (Delarue et al. Lancet Oncol 2013) and between a prophylactic treatment with Darbepoetin alfa in order to maintain hemoglobin level between 13 and 14 g/dL versus an usual management of chemotherapy-induced anemia including ESAs and transfusions. Iron parameters including serum iron, transferrin and ferritin levels and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were measured at screening and at the end of study treatment. Iron deficiency was defined by TSAT below 20% and was considered either as true or functional if ferritin level was below or above normal or value, respectively. Results At diagnosis, median serum iron level was 9 \u00b5mol/L (n=358 patients, range: 0.14-62.6), median transferrin level was 2.1 g/L (n=262 patients, range: 0.3-29), median ferritin level was 325 ng/mL (n=321 patients, range: 6-6071) and median TSAT was 17% (n=258 patients, range: 2-57). Among patients with available TSAT data, 163/258 (63%) presented a coefficient lower than 20%. When comparing with the whole study population, patients with TSAT \u2264 20% had similar baseline characteristics including aaIPI. In univariate analysis, there is no difference of PFS (HR: 1.078, 95%CI: 0.734-1.584, p=0.7006) and OS (HR: 0.963, 95%CI: 0.622-1.491, p=0.8664) according to TSAT. By contrast, in univariate and multivariate analysis, patients with ferritin level lower than normal and patients with ferritin level higher than normal presented, compared with patients with normal ferritin level, worse PFS (respectively, HR: 4,973, 95%CI: 1.673-14.780, p=0.039; HR: 1,654, 95%CI: 1.094-2.499, p =0,017) and OS (respectively HR: 6.204, 95%CI: 1.713-22.475, p=0.0055; HR: 1.8, 95%CI: 1.108-2.923, p =0.0175). Conclusion Elderly patients with untreated aggressive lymphoma and iron deficiency as measured by TSAT showed similar characteristics compared to the whole population. TSAT level did not impact prognosis in contrast to ferritin level, whose variations could be independent of iron metabolism. The high frequency of iron deficiency at diagnosis raise the question of the use of IV iron as a frontline treatment of chemotherapy-associated anemia. A prospective, placebo-controlled, phase III trial is planned within our group, whose primary objective will be to demonstrate efficacy of ferric carboxymaltose alone compared to placebo as measured by the diminution of percentage of patients requiring red blood cell transfusion and/or ESA administration.
