    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4035 Introduction: Bendamustine is a dual alkylating agent with demonstrated efficacy in de novo multiple myeloma (MM) and in relapsed/refractory (R/R MM). We present the preliminary results from the experience of Spanish compassionate use registry of this agent in different treatment schedules of R/R MM, promoted by the GEM/PETHEMA Group (Benda-MMRR-11). This study has been approved by local ethical committee, CEIC, HUP, Madrid, Spain. Patients and Methods: 72 patients, 42 males and 30 females, with advanced R/R MM after several lines of previous treatment received a schedule containing Bendamustine (Levact \u00ae , Mundipharma, UK). Median age was 66 (35\u201386), with a median of 4 previous salvage lines (1\u201311). Bendamustine dose used ranged between 60 and 120 mg/m 2 iv on days 1 and 2 for each 28 days cycle. The median of cycles was 2 (1\u20139). The combinations used were: Bendamustine + Prednisone in 27 patients, Bendamustine + Thalidomide + Prednisone in 11 cases, Bendamustine + Dexamethasone in 14 patients, Bendamustine + Bortezomib + Dexamethasone in 7 patients, Bendamustine + Bortezomib + Prednisone in 3 patients, Bendamustine + Thalidomide + Dexamethasone in 2 cases, Bendamustine monotherapy in 5 patients, Bendamustine + Thalidomide in 1 case, Bendamustine with Caelyx in 1 case and Bendamustine with Rituximab in 1 case. Results: In the 69 evaluable patients, the response was: overall response rate (ORR) 30.24%%, with complete response (CR) 11.5%, partial response (PR) 13.04%. Minimal response (MR) was 5.7%, and stable disease (SD) was 17.39%. Progression was documented in 52.1% of patients. In general, treatment was well tolerated; the most common adverse effect was hematological toxicity with grade 3\u20134 neutropenia in 31.8%, grade 3\u20134 thrombocytopenia in 30.4% and grade 3\u20134 anemia in 17.3%. Other toxicities included grade 3\u20134 infections in 27% of patients and grade 3\u20134 asthenia in 11.5%. Clinical results will be updated with more details regarding TTP, OS and efficacy and toxicity with each schedule. Comments: Bendamustine is an effective salvage therapy in patients with advanced R/R MM. Our results are consistent with previous published data in larger series of patients. More experience is needed with this agent to define the best combination and to assess its grade of efficacy that will be probably superior in earlier stages of myeloma evolution.
