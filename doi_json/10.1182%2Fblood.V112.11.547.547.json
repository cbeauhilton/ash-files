    "abstract_text": "Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and number are tightly regulated in a specific microenvironment - the HSC niche - constituted of several cell types. Amongst them, osteoblasts have a prominent role since their increment is associated with an expansion of HSC. However, we demonstrated that an overall increase in osteoblasts does not necessarily promote hematopoiesis (Lymperi et al, Blood 2008 111:1173-81). We hypothesised that osteoclast mediated bone resorption, a component of the bone remodelling process which regulates osteoblast formation, takes active part in the HSC niche. To address this question we inhibited osteoclast function with the bone catabolic agents bisphosphonates. In vivo administration of bisphosphonates to C57BL/6 mice altered the architecture of the trabecular bone as defined by micro-CT and histomorphometric analysis. Treated mice exhibited increased bone volume and trabecular number and reduced trabecular separation and trabecular pattern factor compared to the untreated controls. This was accompanied to a decrease in the proportion and absolute number of HSC in the bone marrow (BM) as assessed by both the immunophenotypic enumeration of Lin-Sca1+c-kit+Flk2-HSC and the long-term culture- initiating cell (LTC-IC) assay. The number of the colony forming unit-cells (CFU-C) in the BM of bisphosphonate treated mice was increased, while more Lin-Sca1+c-kit+ enriched cells were found in the S/M phase of the cell cycle. These results indicate that, in osteoclast-impaired mice a proportion of HSC enters the cell cycle changing the balance in favour of hematopoietic progenitors. The ability of BM cells from bisphosphonate treated mice to engraft and reconstitute the hematopoietic system was tested in a competitive transplantation assay, whereby BM cells from treated and untreated mice were transplanted into syngeneic irradiated recipients. The long-term engraftment of treated BM cells was inferior to the one of controls, indicating a decrease in HSC numbers. Furthermore, recipient mice treated with bisphosphonates prior to conditioning and BM transplantation experienced a delayed hematopoietic recovery as compared to untreated recipients. Since it has been shown that parathyroid hormone (PTH) administration increases the number of HSC by stimulating osteoblast numbers, mice receiving micro-pump delivered PTH were also injected with bisphosphonates. We observed that the administration of bisphosphonates abolished the ability of PTH to increase the primitive HSC pool size as measured by FACS analysis of the Lin-Sca1+c-kit+Flk2- BM cells and their capacity to engraft and reconstitute irradiated recipients. Our findings demonstrate that the osteoclast function is fundamental for the HSC niche, possibly by promoting the recruitment of osteoblasts with HSC supporting capacity."
