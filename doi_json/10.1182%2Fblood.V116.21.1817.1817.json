    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1817 Azacitidine (AZA) is the first line treatment for IPSS (index prognostic scoring system) high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). To date, only Khan et al. (Exp Hematol. 2008) and Hollenbach et al. (PLoS One. 2009) have reported apoptosis as a mechanism of AZA effect on MDS cell lines. Nevertheless, approximately 40% of patients treated with AZA are refractory to this molecule. To investigate the possible mechanisms of AZA resistance in MDS cells, we developped AZA-resistant cell clones (AZA-R) from the well-characterized MDS cell line SKM1. The bulk resistant SKM1 cell line (AZA-R) was obtained following long time exposure of cells to iterative and increasing doses of AZA ranging from 0.1 to 8mM. We first showed that AZA triggered loss of cell metabolism in SKM1 parental cells but not in their AZA-resistant counterpart at a maximally effective dose of 1mM. AZA-mediated loss of cell metabolism accounted mainly for induction of apoptosis as judged by both an increase in caspase 9 and 3 activities triggered by this compound and by a significant protection in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk in SKM1 parental cells. Conversely, no or very few activation of caspases and apoptosis were detected in AZA-R cells strongly suggesting that apoptosis is impaired in AZA-R SKM1 cells. Finally, unlike in SKM1 cells, AZA failed to induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization in AZA-R SKM1 cells. Importantly, basal autophagy was increased in AZA-R versus AZA-S cells as shown by LC3-I cleavage into LC3-II, p62/SQSTM1 protein expression, cathepsin B activation, mTOR and S6 ribosomal protein dephosphorylation and finally electronic microscopy experiments. In addition, Acadesine, an adenosine derivative and AMPK agonist which targets autophagy was capable to circumvent AZA resistance in both AZA-R SKM1 cells and in medullary cells from five MDS patients resistant to AZA after 6 cycles of Azacitidine. In conclusion, targeting autophagy appears as an attractive therapeutical strategy to circumvent AZA resistance in both established MDS cell lines and cells from MDS patients. Therefore, drugs capable of inducing autophagy or autophagic cell death, such as Acadesine (Robert et al. , PLoS One. 2009) which is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of Chronic Lymphoblastic Leukemia could be also beneficial for HR-MDS patients resistant to AZA.
