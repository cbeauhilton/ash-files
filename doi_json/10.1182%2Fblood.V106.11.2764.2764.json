    "abstract_text": "Although several HLA-A*0201-restricted immunodominant peptides from the leukemia-restricted protein WT-1 are characterized, T cell responses to peptide sequences binding to other common class I and II epitopes of WT-1 remain almost completely unexplored. A more comprehensive definition of the WT-1 antigen would extend peptide antigen vaccines to individuals lacking HLA-A*0201 and *2402 and improve vaccine potency by recruiting both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses. Here we used a WT1 peptide library to identify WT-1 peptide sequences inducing CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses in normal individuals and patients with AML and other myeloid leukemias. Six cases were studied. The library consisted of 110 15mer peptides overlapping by 11aa covering the entire WT-1 protein in 21 pools. Monocytes were isolated by plastic adherence and pulsed with peptide pools for 3 hours. Autologous CD8 + and CD4 + T cells were then added. Pools of peptides were prepared in such a way that each peptide was represented in two different peptide pools, allowing the identification of the respective peptide by responses in the two corresponding pools. Cells were harvested for RNA extraction and reverse transcription. Real time PCR (RQ-PCR) was used to identify peptide-specific induction of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 in CD8 + and CD4 + T cells. The SYFPEITHI binding motif software was then used to predict the probable HLA restriction for the candidate epitopes. To confirm candidate peptide immunogenecity and HLA restriction, selected peptides were synthesized and tested individually. In addition to the known HLA-A*0201 peptides WT37, WT126, WT187 and WT235 we identified 20 new MHC class I and II epitopes of WT1. Four were restricted by more than one HLA allele, demonstrating the promiscuity of epitope binding. One epitope (VPGVAPTLV) was restricted to HLA-A*0201 and HLA-B*5101. One epitope (SGQFTGTAGACRYGP) was restricted by a class I HLA allele, namely HLA-*6801 and a class II HLA allele, DR*1501. Two epitopes (YGPFGPPPPSQASGQ and QKKFARSDELVRHHN) were restricted by multiple MHC class II alleles. The proliferative response of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells to candidate peptides was confirmed using CFSE labeling. We now plan to characterize the antileukemic effects of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells induced by these peptides with a view to designing broad-spectrum vaccines inducing leukemia-reactive T cells across a wide range of HLA types.",
