    "abstract_text": "Background: The majority of adult patients (pts) with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) can achieve complete remission (CR) with conventional multi-agent chemotherapy regimens, with only 30 to 50% of them achieving a long-term cure. Persistence of minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) is associated with poor event-free and overall survival. Blinatumomab, a CD19/CD3 bispecific T-cell engager antibody construct, is capable of eradicating MRD in precursor B-ALL, and possibly prolong survival. We aimed to evaluate blinatumomab in pts with precursor B-ALL who did not achieve MRD negativity after initial therapy or who had MRD relapse. Methods: This is an open-label, single-arm, phase II trial including pts with B-ALL in CR who had either not achieved MRD negativity or had MRD-positive relapse, starting any time after \u22653 months (mo) of frontline therapy, or in CR2 and beyond after at least 1 mo of salvage therapy. Positive MRD was defined as \u22651 x 10 -4 by 6-color multi-parameter flow cytometry. MRD for pts with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) ALL was defined as BCR-ABL1 to ABL1 transcripts ratio of \u2265 0.1% IS by RT-PCR. Pts received continuous IV infusion of blinatumomab 28 \u00b5g/day over 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks treatment-free interval. For the first cycle, blinatumomab was initiated at 9 \u00b5g/day for 1 week and then escalated to 28 \u00b5g/day, if tolerated. A TKI of treating physician's choice was added to the regimen for pts with Ph+ ALL. Responders could receive up to 4 additional consolidation cycles, and subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) was offered depending on donor availability. Pts who do not proceed with ASCT may receive blinatumomab maintenance therapy with one cycle every 3 mo for up to 4 cycles (9 cycles total). Relapse-free survival (RFS) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were the MRD negativity rate at any time and after cycle 1, event-free survival, overall survival (OS), and safety profile. Results: Between 12/2015 and 05/2017, we enrolled 17 pts with precursor-B ALL in CR. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Three pts (18%) had Ph+ ALL. Twelve pts (70%) were in CR1, and 5 pts (30%) were in CR2 and beyond. Eleven (65%) pts had persistent MRD, and 6 (35%) pts had MRD relapse. Pts received a median of 2 cycles (range, 1-5) of blinatumomab. Thirteen out of the 17 pts (76%) achieved MRD negative status at a median time of 41 days (range, 29-92), 3 pts did not achieve a response after 2 cycles, and 1 pt progressed during the first cycle. Of the 13 responders, 12 pts (92%) responded after the first cycle; 1 pt responded after the second cycle. Of them, 6 pts (46%) proceeded to ASCT with median time from enrollment to ASCT of 3 mo (range, 2-6 mo). Therapy was well tolerated. Blinatumomab-related adverse events of any grade were observed in 6 pts (35%). These adverse events included cytokine release syndrome in 3 pts (grade 3, n=1; grade 2, n=2), grade 3 encephalopathy (n=1), grade 3 psychosis (n=1), and grade 1 confusion (n=1). All resolved with supportive management. No pts discontinued blinatumomab due to adverse events. With a median follow-up of 14 mo (range, 2-30 mo), 12 pts (71%) are alive. 8 pts (62%) have remained in remission for more than one year, 5 of them had received ASCT. The 1-year OS and RFS rates were 75% and 68%, respectively (Figure 1). Conclusion: Blinatumomab is well tolerated and is highly effective in eradicating MRD in pts with precursor B-ALL who have persistent MRD or who experience MRD relapse after intensive chemotherapy.
