    "abstract_text": "Mutations in spliceosomal genes are one of the most common classes of somatic alterations in patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and occur across the entire spectrum of myeloid malignancies, including 10\u201225% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations occur in higher proportions in AML subjects greater than 60 years of age, or when AML has transformed from an antecedent MDS. Spliceosomal gene mutations are implicated in the production of pathological RNA splicing patterns that block cell differentiation and maintain a myeloid precursor phenotype. This suggests deranged pre-mRNA splicing is a mechanistic determinant of many heme malignancies and, as such, has provoked interest in therapeutic modulation of pre-mRNA splicing as a treatment paradigm. The CLK/DYRK family of protein kinases has been recognized as an integration hub for signal transduction-dependent modulation of alternative pre-mRNA splice junction selection through direct phosphorylation of the serine/arginine-rich splicing factor (SRSF) splice junction enhancer-binding proteins. Thus, these kinases potentially represent a druggable intervention point in alternative splicing-dependent cancers. The isoquinoline SM08502 (cirtuvivint) is a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor of the Cdc2-like kinases (CLK1-4) and the dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRK1-4) with activity against only a minimal number of the remaining members of the CMGC-family kinases and the kinome as a whole. Here the consequence of pan-CLK/DYRK kinase inhibition on cell viability and tumorigenicity was evaluated across a panel of human tumor-derived AML, DLBCL, MCL, myeloma, T-ALL, and CML/CLL models. EC 50 s in response to cirtuvivint ranged from 0.014 \u03bcM\u20120.495 \u03bcM in 4-day in vitro cell viability assays, with low-dose responders enriched in subsets of AML, myeloma, DLBCL, MCL and T-ALL. Cell viability EC 50 s were associated with induction of programed cell death at drug exposures that inhibited accumulation of phosphorylated SRSF proteins and the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1. To directly evaluate the contribution of CLK/DYRK kinases to alternative splicing profiles, high-depth RNAseq analysis was performed across 4 cell lines (3 acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and 1 mantle cell lymphoma cell line) +/- a 6-hour exposure to 1\u00b5M cirtuvivint. Both baseline and drug-induced changes in alternative splicing events (ASEs) were measured using a multivariate analysis of splicing transcripts (rMATS). The frequency of cirtuvivint-induced ASEs was approximately 20% of total detected ASEs. Concordant drug-induced ASEs among the tested cell lines were in genes enriched in pathways known to drive oncogenesis in hematopoietic lineages, including the MAP kinase and mTOR signaling pathways. Tumor growth inhibition assays in immunocompromised mice showed a range of model-specific responses, including tumor stasis and partial to complete tumor regression at clinically relevant exposures. A cell-based synthetic-lethal screen of cirtuvivint across 36 small molecule inhibitors identified multiple BCL-2 inhibitors among the most prominent synergistic combinations. Consistent with this, combination of the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax with cirtuvivint was sufficient to induce tumor regressions in AML xenograft models (KG-1 and HL-60) that were resistant to either single-agent drug at the same concentrations. These observations support further evaluation of CLK/DYRK inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for heme malignancies dependent upon alternative pre-mRNA splicing.
