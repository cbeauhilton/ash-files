    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3823 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffctive hematopoiesis. Survivin belongs to the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family and inhibits apoptosis. Besides its role as IAP, Survivin appears to function as a subunit of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) for regulating mitosis with other CPC proteins including Aurora-B. As the CPC, Survivin and Aurora-B play an important role in the maintenance of a stable genome. Until now, there has been no report to examine whether expression of Survivin and Aurora-B kinase may be increased in CD34(+) cells prepared from the patients with MDS during disease progression. To investigate the contribution of Survivin and Aurora-B to the progression and prognosis of MDS, we evaluated the expression levels of these two genes in CD34(+) cells prepared from 57 patients with MDS and 50 patients with de novo AML using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The degree of Survivin and Aurora-B expression was highly correlated with the type of MDS, was much higher in RAEB-1, RAEB-2 and secondary AML following MDS (s-AML) compared with normal control, and increased during disease progression. Expression levels of both Survivin and Aurora-B were significantly correlated with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). Furthermore, the amount of Aurora-B kinase was significantly correlated with Survivin expression in MDS and s-AML, but not in de novo AML. Interestingly, the levels of Survivin and Aurora-B were remarkably higher in patients with s-AML when compared with de novo AML. We demonstrated for the first time that high levels of Survivin and Aurora-B kinase expression are distinctive molecular feature of high-risk MDS and s-AML. Marked up-regulations of Survivin and Aurora-B Kinase may contribute to genetic instability and disease progression of MDS. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
