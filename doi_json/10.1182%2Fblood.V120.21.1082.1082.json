    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1082 Megakaryocyte (MK) development is characterized by polyploidization, cytoplasmic maturation and proplatelet formation, which culminates in the release of platelets into the circulation. The tumor suppressor p53 plays a critical role in the regulation of both cell cycle and apoptosis; its function is tightly controlled by the murine double minute (MDM2) protein which facilitates p53 degradation and inhibits p53 transcriptional activity. MK ploidy results from a disruption of normal cell cycle progression termed endomitosis while platelet release is believed to depend on apoptotic processes. The role of p53-MDM2 in MK in these two processes has not been clearly defined. A small molecule RG7112, which disrupts MDM2-p53 interaction, has shown promising anti-tumor effects in phase I clinical trials. This beneficial outcome has, however, been associated with the development of thrombocytopenia. We, therefore, used RG7112 as pharmacological probe to examine the effects of disruption of the MDM2-p53 regulatory loop on MK. We determined the effects of RG7112 on primary human MK by utilizing an in vitro system in which MK were generated from BM-derived CD34 + cells. We first demonstrated that both p53 and MDM2 transcripts are up-regulated as MK differentiation progresses. The ability of CD34 + cells to proliferate in the absence or presence of various concentrations of RG7112 was then evaluated both in liquid cultures and in CFU-MK colony assays. CD34 + cells exposed to 10 \u03bcM RG7112 for 7 days generated 70% fewer viable cells as compared to control cells exposed to the inactive form of the drug ( p value = 0.0038). Furthermore, CD34 + cells treated with RG7112 formed up to 40% less CFU-MK colonies as compared to untreated cells. An assessment of apoptosis of MK precursors generated in the presence of RG7112 revealed that 69.5+2.1% were Annexin V positive as compared to 31.5+3.5% present in control cultures. These findings are consistent with the previously reported role of RG7112 in inducing p53 activation and apoptosis. Interestingly, phenotypical characterization of the viable cells generated under identical culture conditions, showed that RG7112 treatment did not interfere with the ability of CD34 + cells to acquire markers of MK differentiation during the first 7 days of culture since similar degrees of CD41 and CD42 expression were observed in the absence and in the presence of the drug. Likewise, exposure of MK precursors to the drug for 7 additional days (i.e. later stages of maturation) did not influence CD41 and CD42 expression. By contrast, cells differentiated in the presence of 5 \u03bcM RG7112 generated 50% fewer polyploid MK with greater than 4N DNA content as compared to those treated with the inactive form of the drug. Moreover, the negative effects on ploidy were associated with p53 activation, as assessed by the increased levels of p21 protein, a direct target of p53 which is known to limit polyploidization of primary MK. Finally, platelets generated in vitro were analyzed phenotypically and quantitated by dual labeling with anti-CD41 antibodies and thiazole orange (TO). The number of CD41 + /TO + platelets derived from MK generated in the presence of RG7112 was reduced by 22% as compared to control. Based on these findings, we conclude that RG7112 impacts megakaryopoiesis by two potential mechanisms: 1) Impairing the ability of CD34 + cells to generate MK precursors due to increased apoptosis; 2) Limiting polyploidization during the late stages of development due to phamacological activation of p53. A combination of these two effects may provide an explanation for thrombocytopenia observed in patients receiving this drug and suggests that p53 plays an important role in normal human thrombocytopoiesis.
