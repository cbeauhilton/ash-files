    "abstract_text": "The tetraspanin CD81 is required for numerous biological functions including fertilization, infection, cell migration and cellular interactions in the nervous and immune systems. In B cells CD81 is a component of the CD19/CD21 signaling complex. CD81 was shown to facilitate the redistribution of the B cell receptor (BCR) complex and CD21 into lipid rafts in response to co-engagement, and to modulate BCR signaling. In addition, CD81-deficient mice express low levels of cell surface CD19, thereby potentially altering signaling by the CD19/CD21 co-receptor complex. Interestingly, the onset of CD81 expression coincides with the onset of CD19 expression during B cell development. The foregoing observations suggest that CD81 might reduce the in vivo response of B cells to antigenic stimulation. To test this hypothesis we compared the response of CD81-deficient and wild type mice to T-independent (TNP-LPS) and T-dependent (TNP-KLH) antigens. Surprisingly, CD81-deficient mice mounted significantly higher IgM responses against both types of antigens. Moreover, the IgG response of CD81-deficient mice was stronger and persistent in response to T-independent antigen. We further found that CD81-deficient mice have an increase in bone marrow perisinusoidal B cells (IgM + IgD + ). These cells are primarily responsible for mounting T-independent immune responses against blood-borne pathogens. In addition, CD81-deficient spleenic B cells have an intrinsic ability to produce higher amounts of IgM. These surprising results suggest that CD81 is involved in modulating B cell activation, particularly in response to infection."
