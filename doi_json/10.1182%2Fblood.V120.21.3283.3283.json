    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3283 Donor-derived regulatory T cells (T reg ) and natural killer (NK) cells can respectively improve stem cell transplant (SCT) outcome by reducing graft versus host disease (GVHD) severity and exerting a graft-versus-leukemia effect. High frequencies of donor T reg are associated with less GVHD, and low doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2) can expand both NK and T reg after allogeneic SCT. To explore the feasibility of improving the quality of peripheral blood SCT donations, we evaluated the safety and the tolerability of ultra-low dose IL-2 administration to volunteers with the aim of preferentially expanding T reg and NK cells. Twelve healthy volunteers (mean age 34 years; range 22\u201357) received 0.1 or 0.2 million U/m 2 /day IL-2 subcutaneously for 5 days (NIH protocol 11-H-0268). Blood samples were collected before and 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 28 days after IL-2 injection. Samples were analyzed by multiplex techniques including whole transcriptome gene expression with HumanGene 1.0ST microarrays; serum levels of 69 cytokines and chemokines by Luminex assay; and lymphocyte phenotyping by flow cytometry, to comprehensively characterize the cellular and molecular immune response to IL-2 (\u201cIL-2 immunome\u201d). T reg subsets were determined within the CD4+ T cell population using FoxP3, Helios, CD45RA and CD31 to identify thymus-derived natural T reg (nT reg ), induced T regs (iT reg ) and their recent thymic emigrants (RTE). NK cell subsets were determined within CD56+CD3- population using NKG2A, KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2/3, KIR3DL1 and CD57 to identify CD56 bright , CD56 dim NKG2A+KIR-, and CD56 dim KIR+CD57+ cells. All subjects tolerated ultra-low dose IL-2 with minimal adverse events (mainly grade 1\u20132 injection site reactions). The fraction of FoxP3+T reg in CD4 rose significantly above baseline peaking at 4 days (3.7% vs 5.8%; p=0.0004) after the first dose of IL-2. T reg subset analysis demonstrated that the fraction of nT reg and RTE nT reg in CD4 expanded significantly in the lower dose cohort compared to the higher dose cohort (p=0.004 and p=0.005 respectively). %CD56 bright NK significantly increased at 7 days (p=0.008), whereas CD56 dim NKG2A+KIR-, and CD56 dim KIR+CD57+ NK cells remained at baseline. The Ki67 proliferation marker further verified a significant in vivo expansion of CD56 bright NK cells with ultra-low dose IL-2. Cytokine and chemokine profiling demonstrated significant increase circulating level of IP-10 (P=0.0018) through day 2 to 4 after IL-2 injections. In contrast, circulating levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15 and IL-17 remained unchanged after IL-2 injection. Gene expression microarray studies revealed significant changes in 24 genes (P value < 0.1 corrected by false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple testing), including up-regulation of IL-2RA and FOXP3 as early as 2 days after IL-2 injections. Gene Set Analysis (GSA) revealed significant changes (P value < 0.1 after FDR) in innate immune response pathways, including Toll-like receptor signaling and interferon signaling. This is the first study to show that ultra-low dose IL-2 could be safely administrated to healthy volunteers to expand thymic-derived natural T reg and CD56 bright NK cells. These results raise the possibility of using ultra-low dose IL-2 to boost T reg and NK cells in stem cell donors.
