    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1087 Introduction: No data are available in literature about possible different changes in cardiac and hepatic iron and in cardiac function in thalassemia major (TM) patients treated with sequential deferipron\u2013desferrioxamine (DFP-DFO) versus deferasirox (DFX). Magnetic Resonance (MR) is the unique non invasive suitable technique to evaluated quantitatively this issue.Our aim was to prospectively assess the efficacy of the DFP-DFO vs DFX in a large cohort of TM patients by quantitative MR. Methods: Among the first 1135 TM patients enrolled in the MIOT (Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassemia) network, 392 patients performed a MR follow up study at 18 \u00b1 3 months according to the protocol. We evaluated prospectively 35 patients treated with DFP-DFO versus 80 patients treated with DFX between the 2 MR scans. Cardiac iron was evaluated by T2* multiecho multislice technique. Biventricular function parameters were quantitatively evaluated by cine images. Liver iron was measured by T2* multiecho technique. Results: Excellent/good levels of compliance were similar in the two groups (DFP-DFO 97.1% vs DFX 98.8%; P=0.544). Among the patients with no significant myocardial iron overload (MIO) at baseline (global heart T2*\u226520 ms), there were no significant differences between groups to maintain the patients without myocardial iron overload (DFP-DFO 96% vs DFX 98%; P=0.536). Among the patients with MIO at baseline, in both groups there was a significant improvement in the global heart T2* value (DFP-DFO: 4.8\u00b13.9 ms P=0.004 and DFX: 3.5\u00b14.7 P=0.001) and a significant reduction in the number of pathological segments (DFP-DFO: \u22123.2\u00b13.8 P=0.026 and DFX: \u22122.4\u00b13.8 P=0.003). Only in sequential group there was a significant increment in the left and right ventricular ejection fractions (4.3\u00b15.1% P=0.035 and 6.7\u00b16.6% P=0.017, respectively). The improvement in the global heart T2* was not significantly different between groups. The improvement in the left as well in the right ventricular ejection fractions was significantly different between groups (P=0.009 and P=0.015, respectively) ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1.

Among the patients with hepatic iron at baseline (T2*<9.2 ms), only in the DFX group there was a significant improvement in the liver T2* value (2.6\u00b15.3 ms P=0.001). The changes in liver T2* were significantly higher in DFX group than in DFP-DFO (0.5\u00b12.0 ms) group (P=0.030) ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2.

Conclusions: In TM patients prospectively no significant differences on cardiac iron were found between sequential DFP\u2013DFO treatment versus DFX in monoterapy, although the DFP-DFO treatment was significantly more effective in improving biventricular global systolic function. Conversely, DFX was significantly more effective in reducing hepatic siderosis. Disclosures: Pepe: Novartis: Speakers Bureau; Apotex: Speakers Bureau; Chiesi: Speakers Bureau.
