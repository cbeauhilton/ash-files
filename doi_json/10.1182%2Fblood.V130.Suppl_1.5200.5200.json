    "abstract_text": "CG'806 is a non-covalent pan-FMS like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)/Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) multi-kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits wild type (WT) and mutant forms of FLT3 and BTK. As described previously (2017 AACR Hematologic Malignancies abstract #25 and #44), CG'806 inhibits on FLT3-ITD-driven acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other forms of AML. Because CG'806 targets the WT BTK (IC 50 = 8 nM) and the C481S-BTK (IC 50 = 2.5 nM), which is a mutant form resistant to ibrutinib and other covalent BTK inhibitors, this small molecule was profiled for its actions on various types of B-cell malignancies in which B cell receptor (BCR) and BTK signaling are reported to play pivotal pathogenic roles. Against 10 malignant B-cell lines, while CG'806 reduced the level of BTK-Y223 phosphorylation, it was less potent than ibrutinib. In contrast, CG'806 was 50-6,000 times more potent (lower IC 50 ) in the ability to kill the malignant B cells across all tested cell lines evaluated by MTS-based assays of cell proliferation and inhibition of colony formation. Hence, the efficacy of killing malignant B cells by CG'806 and by ibrutinib did not correlate with the degree of BTK inhibition. Pathway analyses (KinomeScan and immunoblotting) demonstrated that CG'806, in addition to inhibiting intracellular BTK, potently inhibited the activity of aurora kinases A, B and C, phospho-H3S10, FLT3 and ERK that are differentially expressed and operative in various cell lines representing mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), B-acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) and Burkitt's lymphoma. Indeed, measuring BrdU incorporation and Annexin V by flow cytometry, CG'806 directly induced polyploidy and triggered apoptosis in malignant B cells at picomolar (pM) to low nanomolar (nM) concentrations, while ibrutinib potently inhibited BTK activity but was unable to induce apoptosis at lower than micromolar (\u00b5M) concentrations. These data distinguish CG'806 from ibrutinib and other covalent and non-covalent BTK inhibitors, and illustrate that CG'806 has activity across a wide range of malignant B cell lines including those intolerant, refractory or resistant (due to the presence of a BTK-C481S mutation) to ibrutinib and other BTK inhibitors.
