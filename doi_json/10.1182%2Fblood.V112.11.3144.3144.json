    "abstract_text": "Background and Significance : Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most heritable hematologic malignancy; however, no common CLL predisposition genes are known. Monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL) is a hematologic syndrome characterized by small accumulations of B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. MBL has a CLL-like immunophenotype, may progress to overt CLL, and is over represented in CLL families. Therefore, MBL observed in the context of familial CLL may be a marker of inherited risk for development of CLL. Detailed characterization of family-associated MBL may also provide mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of familial CLL. Our strategy was to detail the biologic characteristics of CLL in family-associated MBL. Methods : Persons with MBL were identified by flow cytometric screening of peripheral blood from unaffected members of CLL kindreds ascertained by Genetic Epidemiology of CLL Consortium (GEC) sites. Flow cytometry was used to determine the surface immunophenotype including CD38 and intracellular ZAP-70. We defined MBL as populations of CD19 + , CD5 + , CD20 lo , CD23 + B cells that comprised at least 2% of the CD19 + peripheral B cell compartment and did not exceed 5.0 \u00d7 10 9 MBL cells/L. RNA and genomic DNA from single MBL cells isolated by flow cytometric sorting were analyzed using PCR to determine immunoglobulin heavy and light chain sequences. MBL cells were sorted in bulk for FISH for loci associated with clinical CLL. Results : Twenty-two out of 190 (12%) unaffected family members were found to have MBL. We observed significant variability in the size of the MBL clone as a percentage of the CD19 + B cell compartment (mean 32%; range 2%\u201397%). Nonetheless, the absolute size of the MBL clone was small, 15 of 17 individuals had < 200 \u00d7 10 6 MBL cells/L. CD38 expression (defined as CD38 surface expression in \u226530% of MBL cells) was observed in 8 of 18 subjects tested. ZAP-70 (defined as intracellular expression in \u2265 20% of MBL cells) was expressed in 4 of 12 participants. Among 12 subjects tested, 5 MBL expressed both surface IgD and IgM, 3 expressed IgD only, 2 expressed IgM only, and 2 did not express IgD or IgM. Analysis of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains has been completed in 8 individuals. Both immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IgV H ) region mutated (n = 12) and unmutated (n = 4) sequences were observed. Four of 8 individuals had 2 or more unrelated MBL clones (range 2\u20135), including one individual with both unmutated and mutated clones. Among the 16 MBL clones identified in these 8 subjects, V H 3 or V H 4 rearrangements were observed in all MBL clones. The most commonly rearranged IgV H genes were 3\u201307 (3 MBL clones), 3\u201315 (3), and 4\u201334 (3). No VH1 family gene rearrangements were observed. In one individual, a V H 3\u201307 MBL clone showed intraclonal diversification suggestive of antigen driven immunoglobulin sequence changes. Twenty productive light chain rearrangements were identified among the 16 MBL clones, with 11 V\u03bb and 9 V\u03ba genes used. We observed 6 productive rearrangements of V\u03bb1\u201351. MBL cells were bulk sorted for FISH from 9 subjects. Mono or biallelic deletion of 13q14.3 was observed in 5 subjects, the other 4 were normal. Conclusions : Our findings confirm that MBL is commonly observed among the unaffected family members from CLL kindreds. We found that some MBL clones express ZAP-70, CD38 or have unmutated IgV H genes and thus are similar to clinical CLL. The clinical outcome of these MBL clones in relation to our baseline prognostic characterization will be of interest. Small MBL clones are commonly oligoclonal. Importantly, although the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes rearranged in these MBL clones are all commonly used in CLL, the absence of V H 1 and abundance of V\u03bb1\u201351 rearrangements do suggests differences in BCR usage between CLL and MBL. Further investigation of family associated MBL may clarify the genetics and immunobiology of familial CLL.",
