    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4787 Targeted approaches are expected to revolutionize cancer treatment in near future. Fatty acid synthase (FASN), the enzyme responsible for de novo synthesis of fatty acids has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for several cancers however its role in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has not been fully elucidated.. Therefore, we investigated the expression of FASN in tissue micro array cohort of 301 DLBCL patients. FASN was found to be expressed in 62.6% (162/259) DLBCL samples and was seen in highly proliferative tumors manifested by high Ki67 (p<0.0001). Significant association was found between tumors expressing high FASN and c-Met tyrosine kinase (p<0.0002) as well as p-AKT (p=0.0309). In vitro , pharmacological FASN inhibition and SiRNA targeted against FASN triggered caspase dependent apoptosis and suppressed expression of c-Met kinase in DLBCL cell lines which further highlighted the molecular link between FASN and c-Met kinase. Finally, simultaneous targeting of FASN and c-Met with specific chemical inhibitors induced a synergistically stimulated apoptotic response in DLBCL cell lines. These findings provide evidence of an active role of FASN in DLBCL evolution by specifically regulating tyrosine kinases related to malignant transformation strongly suggest that targeting FASN may have therapeutic value in treatment of DLBCL.
