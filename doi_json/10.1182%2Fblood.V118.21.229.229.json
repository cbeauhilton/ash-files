    "abstract_text": "Abstract 229 Introduction: Optimal rational combination targets with Cytarabine (AraC) have not been identified. After the development of a high-throughput, small-interfering RNA (siRNA) platform for suspension cells, we performed the first RNAi sensitizer screen of the human kinome with AraC in myeloid cell lines. Herein we present the final data of this first siRNA-sensitizer screen in leukemias in combination with AraC. Our results include full validation of the selected targets as well as ex vivo data assessing the first in class clinically tested WEE1 inhibitor MK1775 with AraC providing a pre-clinical rationale for using the combination of AraC with WEE1 inhibitors in leukemias. RNAi Screens and siRNA Validation: In siRNA sensitizer screens, we silenced 572 kinases of the human kinome in combination with AraC. Few kinases strongly sensitized to AraC and the targets CHEK1 and the WEE1 related kinase PKMYT1 emerged as the most potent genes whose silencing sensitized leukemia cells to AraC. In secondary siRNA validation experiments, silencing of WEE1 kinase was found to be more potent than silencing of CHEK1, PKMYT1 or other kinases (i.e. ATR, BRCA, AURKB) in combination with AraC treatment. Importantly, the sensitizing activity observed with WEE1 inhibition was universal across all AML cell lines examined, whereas it was not for CHEK1 inhibition. siRNA assays were robust, exhibiting little (<10%) non-specific toxicity and siRNA silencing was specific for individual genes (i.e. WEE1 or CHEK1 ) as demonstrated by selective reduction of mRNA and protein level for the respective genes; confirming the validity of the siRNA assay. Pharmacological WEE1 Inhibitor Experiments In vitro and Ex vivo: In vitro treatment of eight AML, ALL and CML cell lines with commercial and the first clinically developed WEE1 kinase inhibitor MK1775, demonstrated strong sensitization to AraC up to 97-fold in individual cell lines. Ex vivo , MK1775 substantially reduced viability in 13 of 14 AML, MDS and CML patient samples compared to AraC alone. The optimal dose to achieve maximum sensitization was observed for AraC between \u223c10\u2013120 nM and for MK1775 between 200\u2013400 nM. Synergy at these optimal concentrations was confirmed in all ex vivo samples tested for which sufficient data for analysis with CalcuSyn Software was available (n=7): with Combination Indices (CI) ranging from 0.21\u20130.45. At higher AraC and MK1775 concentrations antagonism was observed both ex vivo and in vitro . Thus, we have also established optimal suggested concentration dose ranges for the currently ongoing design of a clinical trial. Clinically relevant, WEE1 is expressed in primary AML, ALL and advanced CML specimens with a trend towards higher expression in relapsed samples. However, there was no direct correlation with WEE1 mRNA expression or TP53 status. Our initial in vitro experiments further suggest that inhibition of WEE1 with MK1775 in combination with AraC at optimal concentrations was associated with higher degree of caspase 3 cleavage, DNA damage induction as measured by gamma-H2AX, and greatest inhibition of proliferation. Thereby establishing a context of optimal drug concentration ranges with molecular correlates and anti-leukemic activity directly informing design of the clinical trial and correlative biomarkers. In conclusion, data from this first siRNA sensitizer screen of the kinome in leukemias identifies inhibition of WEE1 kinase as the most potent sensitizing target to AraC. Inhibiting WEE1 with pharmacological inhibitors in combination with AraC is a rational treatment strategy for myeloid and lymphoid leukemias that warrants clinical investigation. Furthermore, our RNAi loss-of-function genomics approach has high potential to rapidly identify and validate crucial genes whose inhibition modulate the response to cytotoxic agents. Establishment of the siRNA sensitizer platform allows accelerating the development of new rational combinations for leukemia therapy.
