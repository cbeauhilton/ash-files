    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4032 Nuclear export of topoisomerase II alpha (topo II\u03b1) to the cytoplasm results in de novo resistance to topo II\u03b1 inhibitors in hematological malignancies. We have previously demonstrated that topo II\u03b1 is exported from the nucleus of human multiple myeloma cells by a CRM1-dependent mechanism at densities similar to those in myeloma patient bone marrow (Engel et al, Exp. Cell Res. 295:421-31, 2004). We have also identified the nuclear export signals for topo II\u03b1 at amino acids 1017\u20131028 and 1054\u20131066 using mutated full-length FLAG-topo II\u03b1 protein and immunofluorescence microscopy, (Turner et al, J. Cell Sci. 117:3061-71, 2004). In addition, blocking nuclear export with a CRM1 inhibitor or by using CRM1-siRNA sensitizes myeloma cells to topo II poisons (Turner et al. Cancer Res. 69:6899-905, 2009). Therefore, preventing nuclear export may sensitize myeloma cells to topo II inhibitors. To determine what signals CRM1-mediated nuclear export of topo II\u03b1 we investigated the phosphorylation status of topo II\u03b1, both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, using proteomic technologies. Topo II\u03b1 was isolated from the nuclei and cytoplasm of human myeloma cells by immunoprecipitation. Purified topo II\u03b1 fractions were analyzed by Orbitrap mass spectroscopy. We found that serine 1524 was highly phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic fraction. Using site-directed mutagenesis we converted serine 1524 to an alanine to determine if mutated FLAG-tagged topo II\u03b1 export was reduced as compared to wild-type FLAG-tagged topo II\u03b1. Serine 1524 is a CK2 phosphorylation site, therefore, we tested a recently published and highly specific inhibitor of CK2; CX-4945 (Ferguson et al, FEBS Letters 585:104\u2013110, 2011). This drug was used in combination with the topo II\u03b1 inhibitor doxorubicin and assayed for apoptosis by caspase 3 cleavage and flow cytometry both in vitro using myeloma cell lines and ex vivo using patient bone marrow mononuclear cells. Using mass spectroscopy we found that cytoplasmic but not nuclear topo II\u03b1 was phosphorylated at serine 1524, a published CK2 motif. Using site-directed mutagenesis we converted serine 1524 to an alanine and found that mutated FLAG-topo II\u03b1 export was reduced, as compared to wild-type FLAG- topo II\u03b1. The CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 induced apoptosis in both myeloma cell lines and in myeloma patient bone marrow aspirates. In addition, we found that CX-4945 prevented nuclear export of topo II\u03b1 in high-density cells. These data were duplicated using a CK2 specific siRNA to knockdown CK2 expression (90% knockdown). Blocking nuclear export of topo II\u03b1 with the CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 or CK2-specific siRNA sensitized drug-resistant myeloma cells to the topo II poison doxorubicin. These data may have potential clinical implications in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
