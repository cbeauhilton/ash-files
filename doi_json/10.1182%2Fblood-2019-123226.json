    "abstract_text": "Introduction The restricted expression of CD19 in the B-cell lineage makes it an attractive target for the therapeutic treatment of B-cell malignancies. Many monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates targeting CD19 have been developed, including bispecific T-cell redirecting antibodies (T-BsAbs). In addition, anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) have been approved to treat leukemia and lymphoma. However, despite the impressive depth of responses achieved by T-cell redirecting approaches such as T-BsAbs and CAR-T cells, toxicity from over-activation of T-cells remains a substantial limitation for this type of therapy, in particular neurotoxicity. In designing TNB-486, a novel CD19 x CD3 T-BsAb, we endeavored to retain activity against CD19-positive tumor cells while limiting the cytokine secretion thought to underlie toxicity from T-cell redirecting therapies. Utilizing TeneoSeek, a next generation sequencing (NGS)-based discovery pipeline that leverages in silico analysis of heavy chain only/fixed light chain antibody (HCA/Flic, respectively) sequences to enrich for antigen specific antibodies, we made a high affinity \u03b1CD19 HCA and a library of \u03b1CD3 Flic antibodies that showed a >2 log range of EC50s for T cell activation in vitro . Of note, the library contained a low-activating \u03b1CD3 that induced minimal cytokine secretion even at concentrations that mediated saturating T-cell dependent lysis of lymphoma cells (when paired with an \u03b1CD19 HCA). We characterized the relative efficacy and potential therapeutic window of this unique molecule, TNB-486, in vitro and in vivo and compared it to two strongly activating bispecific CD19 x CD3 antibodies similar to those currently available and in clinical development. Methods Affinity measurements of the \u03b1CD19 moiety were made via Biacore (protein) and flow cytometry (cell surface). Stability measurements were made by subjecting the molecule to thermal stress and the %aggregation was measured by Size Exclusion Chromatography. T-cell activation was measured via flow cytometry (CD69 and CD25 expression) and cytokine was measured by ELISA (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, INF-\u0263, and TNF\u03b1) in vitro. Lysis of B-cell tumor cell lines (Raji, RI-1, and Nalm6) was measured via flow cytometry in vitro . In vivo , NOG mice were engrafted subcutaneously with NALM-6 or SUDHL-10 cells and intravenously with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (huPBMC), and the mice treated with multiple doses of TNB-486 or negative or positive control antibody. Tumor burden was evaluated via caliper measurement. Pharmacodynamic/Pharmacokinetic (PK/PD) studies were performed in NOG mice. A pharmacokinetic (PK) study was performed in BALB/c mice, and a tolerability and PK study are ongoing in cynomolgus monkeys. Results TNB-486 bound to cell surface CD19 with single digit nanomolar affinity (~3nM). EC50s for cytotoxicity were in the single-digit nanomolar range for TNB-486, and sub-nanomolar for the strongly activating controls; TNB-486 maximum achievable lysis was identical to the positive controls. TNB-486 induced significantly less cytokine release for all cytokines tested compared to the positive controls even at doses saturating for tumor lysis. No off-target activation was observed in the absence of CD19 expressing target cells. In vivo , TNB-486 eradicated all CD19-positive tumors tested (NALM-6 and SUDHL10) at doses as little as 1\u00b5g administered every four days after tumors had reached ~200mm 3 . TNB-486 showed a PK profile consistent with other IgG molecules in mice (T 1/2 ~6 days in mice). Conclusions TNB-486 induced comparable lysis of CD19-positive tumor cells as the strongly activating control bispecific antibodies while inducing significantly reduced cytokine secretion, even at doses saturating for tumor lysis in vitro . In vivo TNB-486 eradicated all tested CD19 positive tumor cell lines in established tumor models . No off-target binding was observed. In summary, TNB-486 shows promise as a lymphoma therapeutic differentiated from T-cell targeted therapies currently in the clinic and in clinical trials.
