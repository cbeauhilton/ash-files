    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5192 Forkhead proteins play a broad role in endothelial cell biology. These factors mediate cell adhesion to extracellular matrix, regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic genes, and participate in cell repair, proliferation and apoptosis. FoxOs are known downstream targets of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Phosphorylation of FoxO transcription factors results in their translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting their transcriptional activity. It has recently been shown that the deletion of the three FoxO isoforms in endothelial cells protects mice from vascular dysfunction. Gas6, a member of the vitamin K-dependent family of proteins, has been shown to protect endothelial cells from apoptosis and promote endothelial cell activation in vivo . It has been shown that the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were blunted in the absence of gas6. Interestingly, a role for VCAM-1 in the pathogenesis of venous thrombosis has been proposed. Elevated levels of the soluble form of VCAM-1 have been detected in the serum of patients with venous thrombosis. We previously demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic effect of gas6 was mediated partially through FoxO1, but overall, the signalling mechanisms occurring downstream of gas6 remain largely unknown. We hypothesize that gas6 promotes thrombin-induced VCAM-1 expression through the regulation of FoxO1 in endothelial cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that thrombin induced time dependent phosphorylation of FoxO1 with a maximum at 30 minutes in WT (p<0. 05) but not in gas6 deficient (\u2212/\u2212) cells. In addition, thrombin reduced the nuclear content of FoxO in WT (p<0. 05) but not in gas6 \u2212/\u2212 endothelial cells. Using qPCR, we found that mRNA expression of VCAM-1 was increased after 30 minutes of stimulation with thrombin in WT cells (p<0. 05). More importantly, thrombin-mediated induction of VCAM-1 was blunted in gas6 \u2212/\u2212 endothelial cells. We found that FoxO1 siRNA increased basal VCAM-1 expression in WT endothelial cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that gas6 is a crucial mediator of FoxO1 that regulates thrombin-induced VCAM-1 expression. This pathway may explain the pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory role of gas6. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
