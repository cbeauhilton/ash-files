    "abstract_text": "Mutations in genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 are frequently observed in numerous cancers including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and angioimmunoblastic t-cell lymphoma (AITL). The roles of mutant IDHs in tumorigenesis remain unclear because of a lack of appropriate cancer models. Here we established a mouse AML model harboring an IDH2 mutation. IDH1/2 mutations in AML frequently occur simultaneously with mutations in other genes such as NPM, DNMT3A , and FLT3 . In accordance with these observations, IDH2/R140Q, NPMc, DNMT3A/R882H and FLT3/ITD cooperatively induced AML in the mouse model. When only three out of the four mutant genes were transduced, the onset of AML was delayed in any combinations. These results clearly indicate that all four mutations are necessary for the efficient induction of AML. Gene-expression analysis indicated that IDH2/R140Q and NPMc cooperatively activate Hoxa9/Meis1 and hypoxia pathways to maintain AML cells in vivo . These two pathways are likely to be important for the IDH2/R140Q-mediated engraftment/survival of NPMc + cells in mice. DNMT3A/R882H further upregulated the expression levels of Meis1. Furthermore, DNMT3A/R882H promoted the maintenance of cells in an undifferentiated state. Previous studies have shown that FLT3/ITD promotes cell growth and survival. Taken together, our results suggest that multiple signaling pathways are activated in this IDH-mediated AML system. The tumor-associated mutant IDHs catalyze the formation of an oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which dysregulates a set of \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that includes epigenetic regulators (TETs and KDM4A), hypoxic signaling molecule (EGLN) and others (collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases). Because mutant IDHs act via a mechanism that is completely different from those of previously described oncogenes, it has attracted increasing attention as a new therapeutic target. Small molecules that potently and selectively inhibit the mutant IDHs induced differentiation of cancer cells in vitro . However, it remains unclear whether the mutant IDHs are valid targets for cancer therapy in vivo . Here we report that AML harboring IDH2/R140Q can be blocked by conditional deletion of IDH2/R140Q, even after leukemia has developed. Deletion of IDH2/R140Q blocked 2-HG production and the maintenance of Csf-1r+ and c-Kit+ leukemia stem cells, resulting in survival of the AML mice. These results indicate that the IDH2 mutation is critical for the development and maintenance of AML stem cells, and that mutant IDHs are promising targets for anticancer therapy.
