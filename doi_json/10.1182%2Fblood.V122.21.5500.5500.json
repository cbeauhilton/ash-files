    "abstract_text": "Introduction Zinc is an important trace mineral for the body, being a cofactor of enzymes responsible for the synthesis of nucleic acids, and maintaining the immune system. Symptoms of zinc deficiency, such as alopecia, diarrhea, skin rash and growth failure, can be confused with those of hematopoietic stem cell post-transplant (HSCT). Some studies show that zinc supplementation, with the purpose of increase of its serum level, reducing the incidence of mucositis, xerostomia, pain and loss of taste. Zinc deficiency is reported in children with leukemia, but there are very few studies in adults. Material and methods 45 adult patients were evaluated, 22 women and 23 men, mean age 49 \u00b1 16 years-old, undergoing HSCT in Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein during the period of 1 year (2012-2013). The serum zinc level, whose average was 69 \u00b1 16 mg/dl, was evaluated in the first day of hospitalization for HSCT and no patient took zinc supplements before it. Results 48% of patients had zinc deficiency, being most prevalent in patients > 60 years, which had 60%. There was no difference between the sexes. Conclusion Some studies believe that zinc, will be a very important agent in transplant medicine, due to its action on the improvement of the severity of mucositis induced by chemotherapy in patients with leukemia. In our study we found a high prevalence of zinc deficiency in adults and the elderly. Therefore, the assessment of zinc serum levels should be considered in patients submitted to HSTC, as a purpose of treatment and improvement of complications related to it.
