We presenting (viewing) retrospective evaluation of the effects of SAA therapy using hATG and rATG. 49 children (20 girls and 29 boys, aged 1.2\u201317) were treated between 1993 and 2000 - hATG (15mg/kg/day for 5 days with cyclosporine 5mg/kg/day for 12\u201324 mths). On day 180 day of treatment there was a complete response (CR) in 22 of 49 children (44.5%) and a partial response (PR) in 12 children (24.4%). 34 of 49 children (69,4%) responded to treatment. There was no remission (NR) in 15 of 49 children (30.6%). In the whole group there were 7 deaths during the first 6 months. There were no relapses within 5 years of observation. The 5-year probability of survival in this group was 84%. 55 children (22 girls and 33 boys, aged 3,5\u201317,7 years) were treated in the years 1996\u20132009 using rATG (3.75 mg/kg/day for 5 days and cyclosporine 5mg/kg/day for 12\u201324 mths). On day 180 of treatment 5 patients (9%) achieved a CR, 23 children (41.8%) had a PR. 28 of 55 children (50.9%) responded to treatment. NR was found in 27 children (49%).In the rATG group 15 deaths (27%) were recorded, 4 patients (7%) had relapses. In one child paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria was noted.The 5-year survival in the rATG.group was 63.54%. Our results show the greater effectiveness of treatment with horse globulin than rabbit globulin in terms of hematological response and overall survival.
