    "abstract_text": "Haploidentical donors are alternative stem cell sources for the patients without matched related and unrelated donors. Finding a full match unrelated donor takes at least 6 months. Most of the patients who have advanced acute leukemia die during this period. Unfortunately, they also loose the chance of haploidentical stem cell transplantation (SCT). Aim: To report the outcome of six patients whom underwent haploidentical stem cell transplantation using FLAMSA regimen as initial reduction of leukemic burden. Patients and Treatment : There were six patients (F/M: 3/3) who admitted to transplantation unit between November 2012 and December 2013. Table 1 shows the characteristics of patients. Patients received fludarabine 30mg/m2, ARA-C 2gm/m2, Amsacrine 100 mg/m2 (FLAMSA) consequently 4 days before the intiation of conditioning protocol. According to the conditioning protocol number of the rest days changed (Table 2). For transplantation G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells were used. No graft manipulation was performed, 5x10e6 CD34+ cells/kg were requested. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg/day (+3,+4), Tacrolimus 0.03 mg/kg/day +5 and MMF 3x15mg/kg +6 was started. In the absence of GVHD, MMF was discontinued by day +30, tacrolimus was tapered from day +60 to +100. Results: All of the patients had active diseases. Three of the six patients died during conditioning. Transplantation related mortality (TRM) was 50%. The other three patients were alive on the day 100. Overall survive (OS) on day 100 was %50. Two patients (22%) lived beyond 6 months. Of these two, one of them has completed the first year (16%) and is still alive without GVHD or disease relaps. Outcome of the patients are shown in Table 2. Discussion: The patient number is so restricted to draw any conclusions from this report but we know that Allogeneic SCT is the most effective treatment for a variety of hematologic malignancies. The current data suggest that the chosen sequential strategy of intensive chemotherapy followed after a few days of rest by allogeneic SCT has encourging results. Combining this modality with haploidentical transplantation may represent a step forward in the treatment of refractory hematologic malignancies.
