    "abstract_text": "After the report of two cases of leukaemia caused by insertional mutagenesis of a retroviral vector in children with SCID, it became clear that safety issues of therapeutic gene transfer must be addressed more thoroughly. We analysed whether gene transfer into mature T cells and haematopoietic stem cells bear the same risk of generating T cell leukaemia through activation of specific T cell oncogenes, such as LMO2, TCL1 and \u0394TrkA. To address this issue, we used the Rag-1 mouse model, which allows long term analysis of transplanted T cells and haematopoietic stem cells. We were able to transduce mature T cells and haematopoietic stem cells of C57BL/6 (Ly5.1) donor mice with oncoretroviral vectors expressing LMO2, TCL1 and \u0394TrkA. Transduction efficacies of up to 70% were achieved for mature T cells and approximately 90% for haematopoietic stem cells. After transplantation into Rag-1-deficient recipients, stem cell transplanted animals developed T cell lymphomas/leukemia for all investigated oncogenes after characteristic incubation times, mostly of a CD8+CD4+ double positive phenotype. T cell lymphomas were characterised by gross thymic mass, splenomegaly and heavily enlarged lymph nodes, although none of the control- vector- transduced mice developed lymphoma/leukaemia. LM PCR analysis revealed mono- or oligoclonality of the tumours. T cell transplanted animals showed no signs of leukaemia development so far. However, after several attempts, one immortalized T cell progenitor clone could be generated after transduction with LMO2. Our results so far indicate that mature T cells are less susceptible to transformation by known T cell proto-oncogenes, but the studies are still ongoing."
