    "abstract_text": "Currently, chemotherapy is the most effective treatment for multiple myeloma (MM). Although some new drugs have been shown to prolong survival in MM patients, these patients are prone to rapid relapse after high-dose treatment. Recent studies show that several bone marrow (BM) stromal cells are potentially involved in drug resistance. However, the role of other stromal cells is unclear. Adipocytes (ADs) are a major component of BM stromal cells. ADs have been shown to be involved in tumor rapid growth, metastasis, and apoptosis. Clinical studies suggest that BM ADs are associated with an increased risk of MM. Moreover, ADs isolated from patient BM biopsies were shown to support MM proliferation and migration. However, no published study has examined the importance of ADs in MM drug resistance. In addition, autophagy activation has been shown to induce drug resistance in cancer patients. We hypothesized that BM ADs protect MM cells from chemotherapy drug-induced apoptosis by autophagy activation. To examine the role of ADs in MM drug resistance, MM cells were cocultured with ADs at a ratio of 1:5 for 24 hours in medium with melphalan, dexamethasone, or bortezomib, the commonly used drugs for the treatment of MM. MM cells included primary MM cells isolated from BM aspirates of 5 MM patients and 6 MM cell lines. Human ADs were generated from mesenchymal stem cells derived from the BM mononuclear cells of healthy human fetal bones or BM aspirates of MM patients or healthy adult donors, cultured in AD medium for 2 weeks. ADs generated in vitro contained cytoplasmic Oil red O + lipid droplets and produced triglycerol. Our results showed less drug-induced MM apoptosis in cocultures of MM cells and ADs compared with cultures of MM cells alone. Western blot analysis showed that treatment with melphalan upregulated the levels of cleaved caspase-9 and -3, but not -8, and PARP in MM cells. Compared with cultures alone, cocultures with ADs showed significantly lower levels of cleaved caspase-9, -3, and PARP in melphalan-treated MM cells. Mechanistic studies further showed that cocultures of ADs, compared with cultures alone, significantly upregulated the expression of autophagy proteins LC3B, Atg3, Atg5, and LAMP-1, but not Beclin-1. The addition of autophagy inhibitors 3-methyl adenine and chloroquine diphosphate to the cocultures remarkably enhanced apoptosis and caspase activation. Furthermore, we observed that cocultures of MM cells and ADs with either cell-cell contact or those separated by transwell inserts conferred similar protection from drug-induced apoptosis. We identified that AD-produced adipokines such as adiponection, leptin, adipsin, IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-a, and IGF-1, but not VEGF and CRP, were abundant in all examined ADs. Among these adipokines, adiponection, leptin, and adipsin were mainly produced from ADs and not from BM stromal cells, whereas other adipokines were produced from both cells. The addition of antibodies against these adipokines to the cocultures enhanced apoptosis and reduced autophagy, whereas addition of these adipokines to the cultures alone inhibited apoptosis and enhanced autophagy. In vivo studies validated these findings that injection of BM-derived ADs into the implanted human bones of SCID-hu mice bearing primary MM cells reduced response to treatment with melphalan and induced autophagy activation. Taken together, our findings elucidate a novel mechanism of MM drug resistance, through BM ADs. Our studies also provide evidence that targeting BM ADs may be a new approach to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy for the treatment of MM.
