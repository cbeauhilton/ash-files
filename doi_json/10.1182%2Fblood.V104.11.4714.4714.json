    "abstract_text": "Vasculitis rarely complicates solid tumors but is more common in hematologic malignancies, particularly MDS,. We report characteristics and outcome of 21 patients with both MDS and vasculitis. Patients : We retrospectively collected data of patients with at least 1 malignancy (including MDS) and vasculitis diagnosed between 1992 and 2002 in 6 French centers. Vasculitides occurring during cancer remission were excluded, as were giant-cell arteritis, relapsing polychondritis (a well known association with MDS), cryoglobulinemia, infection- or drug-induced vasculitis. Results : 60 patients, with median follow-up of 45 months were analyzed. Vasculitides diagnosed were: cutaneous leukocytoclastic (LV,45%), polyarteritis nodosa (PAN,36.7%), Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis (WG,6.7%), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA,5%), Henoch-Schonlein purpura( HSP,5%). Cancers were hematological (66.7%) (including 21 MDS (35%) and (23%) lymphoid malignancies) and solid tumors (41.7%). Five patients had 2 cancers. 21 patients had vasculitis associated with MDS (median age 66 yr; M/F ratio 4.25). FAB classification was: RAEB (n=11), RA (n=3) and CMML (n=7). Vasculitides were LV (n=9), PAN (n=9), MPA(n=1), WG (n=1), cutaneous granulomatous vasculitis (n=1).CMML were only associated with necrotizing vasculitis ( 6PAN, 1WG). Vasculitis and MDS were diagnosed simultaneously in 12(57%) cases, vasculitis was diagnosed after MDS in 8 (38%) cases (median interval: 11 months, range 1\u201345) and 6 months before MDS in 1 case.9 MDS progressed to AML. Vasculitides developed before or at the time of leukemic progression in 6 of them (median interval 3 months, range 0\u201312). Main vasculitis symptoms were: fever (47%), skin lesions(81%), arthralgias (62%), peripheral neuropathy (14%), renal involvement (43%)[microaneurysms 29%, renal failure 9.5%, glomerulonephritis 9.5%], inflammatory syndrome (81%), ANCA (20%). Vasculitis therapy was steroids (90%) +/\u2212 immune suppressors (33%). MDS treatment was: AraC( n:2), VP16 (n:3), hydroxyurea (n:2),allogeneic BMT (n:2), symptomatic (n:12). Vasculitis was cured in 10 (47%) cases. 17 (81%) patients died; only 1 death was linked to vasculitis. Regardless of the type, vasculitides associated with MDS had significantly more frequent renal involvement (p=0.02),steroid dependence (p=0.04), and less recovery (p=0.04) than vasculitides without MDS Conclusion : Vasculitides associated to MDS appear to have distinctive features and more severe evolution.In addition, occurrence of vasculitides during the course of MDS may be associated with a high risk of rapid leukemic progression.",
