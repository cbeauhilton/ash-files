    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Relapse of the malignant disease remains the major challenge after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) HCT. Here we investigate the outcome of haematological relapse after low dose TBI-based conditioning regimens and the possibility to monitor minimal residual disease in patients with AML with the aim to prevent haematological relapse. Patients and methods: From 7/98 \u2013 12/06, 156 consecutive pts [86 m/70 f; median age 61 (range 21\u201375) y] with CD34 + AML, n=138 and high-risk MDS, n=18 received RIC-HCT. Stage of disease at HCT was CR1, n= 99 (63%), CR2, n=18 (12%), and >CR2, n=39 (25%). HCT were performed from matched related donors (n=40) or matched unrelated donors (n=116) after 200cGy TBI \u00b1 fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 /day on 3 days followed by mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. Chimerism was monitored at days (d) 28, 56, 84, and at 3 months interval thereafter in unsorted as well as flow-sorted CD3 + and CD34 + bone marrow cells by FISH for the XY chromosome in gender mismatched (100\u2013300 IP) or PCR based analysis of polymorphic micro satellite regions in gender matched HCT. A decrease of >5% CD34 + donor chimerism (\u201cCD34 + relapse\u201d) was followed by a taper of immunosuppression. Haematological relapse was defined as increase of blasts to >5%. Results: Of the 156 patients, 141 pts engrafted as shown by donor T-cell chimerism. OS, RI, and NRM at 5 y were 38\u00b10,05%, 47\u00b10,06%, and 30\u00b10,05% respectively. From the 141 patients, 48 had hematological relapse. Treatment of relapse included reduction of immunosuppression, low dose AraC and intensive chemotherapy \u00b1 mobilized buffy coat. CR was achieved in 50% of the patients. Reduction of immunosuppression and/or DLI (p=0,04), amount of overall donor chimerism at diagnosis (p=0,01), the interval from HCT to relapse (p=0,02), and the occurrence of GvHD (p=0,05) were factors associated with CR in the multivariate analysis. Survival of patients with haematological relapse, however, was poor (3,6\u00b10.03% at 5a). All patients with haematological relapse within 100 d died despite therapy. Survival was independently influenced by the time of relapse after HCT (100 d; p=0.001), by the myeloblast count in the marrow (p=0.01) and by the type of relapse (haematological vs. \u201cCD34 relapse\u201d only). All patients with haematological relapse and available CD34 + donor chimerism (38/48 patients) had a decrease of CD34 + chimerism a median of 17 (range 0\u2013181) d before the diagnosis of haematological relapse. Decrease of CD34 + chimerism without total chimerism decrease was observed in 12 additional patients (8,7%) a median of 149 (range 56\u2013852) d after HCT. CD34 + donor chimerism amounted 84 (0\u201392)% before and returned to 100 (93\u2013100)% after reduction of immunosuppression. Survival of these patients was 90\u00b19% at 4 y. Conclusions: We conclude that relapse after low-dose TBI based conditioning has a poor outcome with survival of <10% at 5 years in patients with AML. All patients with haematological relapse within 100 days died despite therapy. Determination of CD34 + donor chimerism allows early detection of relapse in patients with AML and can be used to tailor the immunosuppressive therapy after HCT.",
