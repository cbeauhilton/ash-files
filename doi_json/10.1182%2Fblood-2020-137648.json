    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Hemophilia A is a rare bleeding disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the F8 gene, resulting in insufficient factor VIII (FVIII) activity. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene transfer enables the delivery of a modified functional F8 gene to hepatocytes that subsequently synthesize FVIII at levels that may prevent bleeding events in the absence of exogenous FVIII. Updated results and follow-up from the Alta study, an ongoing gene therapy study in patients with severe hemophilia A, are presented. Methods: The Alta study is a phase 1/2 dose-ranging, single-dose study of giroctocogene fitelparvovec (also known as SB-525 and PF-07055480), a recombinant AAV serotype 6 (rAAV6) vector encoding a modified F8 gene. Adults aged \u226518 years with severe hemophilia A were eligible for inclusion. Giroctocogene fitelparvovec was infused into patients in 4 cohorts of 2 patients each across 4 ascending doses (9e11, 2e12, 1e13, and 3e13 vg/kg). The 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort was expanded with 3 additional patients. Key end points included safety, circulating FVIII activity, use of FVIII replacement therapy, and frequency of bleeding events. Presented data are from the ongoing Alta study (NCT#03061201; data cutoff date, 26 May 2020; database not locked; data reflect those at time of data cutoff, have not undergone standard quality checks, and may be subject to change). Results: Eleven male patients participated in the study (mean [SD] age, 30.3 [7.8] years; white, 81.8%). As of the cutoff date, patients have been followed for 35 to 144 weeks; one patient in the 1e13 vg/kg cohort discontinued from the study. Overall, the most commonly reported adverse events (AEs; n) included increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT; 8 [72.7%]), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST; 5 [45.5%]), upper respiratory tract infection (4 [36.4%]), and pyrexia (4 [36.4%]). Treatment-related serious AEs were reported in 1 patient (in the 3e13 vg/kg cohort) who experienced hypotension and fever \u22486 hours after giroctocogene fitelparvovec infusion; the events fully resolved with treatment and did not delay post-infusion discharge. In the 3 lower-dose cohorts, no ALT elevation requiring more than 7 days of corticosteroid treatment was observed. Of the 5 patients in the 3e13 vg/kg cohort, 4 had elevations in ALT that were managed with a tapering course of corticosteroids (ranging from 10-134 days) without loss of clinically relevant FVIII activity through 40 weeks, as evidenced by a lack of bleeding events before and after treatment with corticosteroids. Increases in FVIII activity from baseline were generally dose-dependent. Patients in the 3e13 vg/kg cohort achieved a mean normal-range of FVIII activity within 5 weeks post-infusion, with mean FVIII activity maintained through week 40, which is the last time point with data for all 5 patients in this cohort (Table). Following the initial prophylactic period of up to \u22483 weeks after giroctocogene fitelparvovec administration, no bleeding events occurred in any patient treated in the 3e13 vg/kg cohort. Use of FVIII replacement therapy \u22653 weeks after giroctocogene fitelparvovec administration was reported in 5/6 patients in the lower-dose cohorts (range: 9-115 infusions); none of the patients in the 3e13 vg/kg cohort required FVIII replacement beyond initial use of prophylactic factor for up to \u22483 weeks (prophylactic coverage stopped 3 weeks and 2 days after giroctocogene fitelparvovec administration in 1 patient in the 3e13 vg/kg cohort). Conclusions: To date, a single infusion of giroctocogene fitelparvovec gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia A resulted in dose-dependent and sustained increases in FVIII levels without administration of exogenous FVIII, bleeding episodes or sustained adverse events in the highest-dose cohort (3e13 vg/kg). Additionally, patients treated in the highest-dose cohort achieved a mean FVIII activity in the normal range within 5 weeks, which was maintained through week 40. Data on all patients with more than 1 year of follow-up will also be presented. The study is ongoing, and these interim results support further development of giroctocogene fitelparvovec for the treatment of patients with severe hemophilia A.
