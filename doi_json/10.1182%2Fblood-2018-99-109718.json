    "abstract_text": "Background: Current prognostication in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) utilizes MIPSS70 (mutation-enhanced international prognostic scoring system for transplant-age patients), MIPSS70+ version 2.0 (karyotype-enhanced MIPSS70) and GIPSS (genetically-inspired prognostic scoring system, which is based on mutations and karyotype) ( JCO 2018;36:310; JCO doi: 10.1200/JCO.2018.78.9867; Leukemia . 2018;doi:10.1038/s41375-018-0107). These contemporary models are inter-complimentary and highly efficient in predicting overall survival. However, specific risk factors for very long survival (e.g. 20+ years) and short-term mortality (i.e. death within 5 years of diagnosis) have not been systematically looked into. Methods : Study patients were recruited from the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. Diagnoses were according to the 2016 World Health Organization criteria ( Blood . 2016;127:2391 ). Logistic regression statistics was used to identify predictors of 20-year survival and 5-year mortality. Variables evaluated in the logistic model included those that are currently listed in MIPSS70, MIPSS70+ version 2.0 and GIPSS, as well as age (\u226470 vs >70 years) and sex. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) were used to estimate predictive accuracy. The JMP\u00ae Pro 13.0.0 software from SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA, was used for all calculations. Results: A total of 1,282 consecutive patients with PMF (median age 65 years, range 19-92; 63% males) were used to identify 26 (2%) patients (median age 51 years, range 28-71; 38% males) who survived their disease for at least 20 years (very long-lived patients) and 626 (49%) patients (median age 68 years, range 27-92; 66% males) who died within 5 years of their diagnosis. Clinically-derived information, including the clinical variables used in MIPSS70 and MIPSS70+ version 2.0 , with the exception of fibrosis grade (information available in 60%), was available in 99% of the study population; cytogenetic information was available in 94%, driver mutational status in 71% and the full profile of high molecular risk (HMR) mutations, including ASXL1 , SRSF2 , U2AF1 Q157, EZH2 , IDH1 and IDH2 , in 42%. MIPSS70+ version 2.0 risk distribution for the entire study population ( n =1,282) was 4% very low risk, 16% low risk, 19% intermediate risk, 40% high risk and 21% very high risk; the corresponding percentages for the 26 very long-lived patients were 14%, 29%, 14%, 43% and 0% and for the 626 short-term survivors were 0%, 4%, 10%, 47% and 39% (p<0.001). Cytogenetic, driver mutation and HMR mutation information was available in 100%, 58% and 27% of the 26 long-term survivors, respectively, and 98%, 63% and 39% of the 626 short-term survivors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis of 20-year survival identified the following seven variables as being favorable: age \u226470 years (p=0.002); female sex (p=0.03); hemoglobin level \u226510 g/dl for women and \u226511 g/dl for men (p=0.03), leukocyte count \u226425 x 10 9 /l (p=0.009), platelet count \u2265100 x 10 9 /l (p=0.002), circulating blasts \u22641% (p=0.03) and absence of constitutional symptoms (p=0.04). The particular phenotypic profile exhibited a high degree of predictive accuracy with an estimated AUC of 0.90 (Figure 1a); karyotype and mutations did not retain significance in this particular analysis; in fact, 5 (71%) of the 7 long-term survivors who were informative harbored at least one HMR mutation. A similar analysis for 5-year mortality identified the following risk factors: high molecular risk mutations (p<0.001); unfavorable or very high risk karyotype (p<0.001); absence of type 1/like CALR mutations (p70 years (p25 x 10 9 /l (p=0.004); and circulating blasts >1% (p=0.001); predictive accuracy was estimated at AUC 0.87 (Figure 1b). Conclusions: The phenotypic profile of long-lived patients in PMF includes young age (\u226470 years old), female sex, asymptomatic disease (i.e. no constitutional symptoms) and absence of moderate to severe anemia, thrombocytopenia or leukocytosis and \u22641% circulating blasts; each one of these parameters, with the exception of female sex, were present in \u226580% of long-term survivors. Karyotype and mutations were more relevant in predicting short-term mortality. View large Download slide View large Download slide  Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
