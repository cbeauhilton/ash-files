    "abstract_text": "We have previously proposed the dysregulation of the D type cyclins by chromosome translocations to the IgH locus or by not fully characterized mechanisms in hyperdyploid patients as a unifying genetic event in the pathogenesis of Monoclonal Gammopathy of Uncertain Significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma (MM). However, no experimental data are available to evaluate the direct consequences of cyclin Ds overexpression in plasma cells. Similarly, activating mutations of KRAS have been identified in 15% of MM patients, but never in MGUS, and have been proposed to contribute to the progression of MGUS to MM, but this hypothesis has never been experimentally validated. We evaluated the contribution of CyclinD1 and KRAS to the development and progression of monoclonal gammopathy (MG) that develops spontaneously in C57BL/6 mice. We aged a cohort of EuCCND1 mice, and lslKRASV12 mice crossed to three different CRE expressing mice: IgG1CRE, CD19CRE or Vk* CRE (KRAS/CRE). A cohort of Vk* MYC mice, Vk* MYC x EuCCND1 (MYC/CD1) and triple transgenic mice (CD1/KRAS/CRE) was also analyzed. Mice were bled every 10 weeks beginning at 30 weeks, and the presence of MG was evaluated by serum protein electrophoresis. The median Time To M-Spike (mTTS) detection was 97 weeks in C57Bl/6, 63w in EuCCND1, 54w in KRAS/CRE, 54w in Vk* MYC, 38w in CD1/KRAS/CRE and 36w in MYC/CD1 mice. This indicates that acceleration of the development of MG occurs in all these strain of mice. However, we noticed that the spontaneous MG in C57BL/6 wt, EuCCND1 or KRAS/CRE rarely progresses (as determined by detection of a M-spike >7 g/L), while in the other mouse strains it frequently progresses, with a mTTS >7 g/L around 65w. A clear progression of MGUS to MM was observed only in Vk* MYC mice, and was further accelerated in MYC/CD1 mice, which are characterized by extra-medullary disease and shorter overall survival. In conclusion, these data support our hypothesis that Cyclin Ds dysregulation in plasma cells is the initial transformation step leading to MGUS. Further oncogenic events, like activating mutations of KRAS are required to expand the monoclonal plasma cells. Among the oncogenes examined MYC provides the greatest acceleration of the MG in wildtype and EuCCND1 mice, and results in a disease with the malignant features of MM.
