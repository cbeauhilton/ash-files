    "abstract_text": "100 cases of aged non-hematological anemia patients hospitalized in our hospital since July 1, 2000, were analyzed for study on anemia etiology. The mean age was 72.08+/\u221210.86 (60\u201390) years (60~ 42; 70~ 39; 80~ 18; 90~ 3) at hospitalization. The etiology of anemia with known showed as followed: Malignant tumor 34: included digestive system malignant tumor 27 (gastric cancer 7, rectal carcinoma 7, colon cancer 6, liver cancer 3, cholangiocarcinoma 2, pencreatic duct cancer 2), lung cancer 3, urinary tract cancer 2, bone sarcoma 2. Iron deficiency anemia 47: digestive tract ulcer 16, hemorrhoid 14. The total number of iron deficiency anemia includes digestive tumors with bleeding. Single nutrition deficiency anemia, macrocytic anemia, i.e. vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency (non-malignant, Non-iron deficiency anemia) 8. Inherited Anemia 10: Thalassemia 6, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency 4. Chronic diseases 23: Bone fracture 19, Stroke 18, infection 12, Diabetes 10, Kidney function failure 8, Gynecological bleeding 4. The etiology of anemia is unknown 29: it included some chronic diseases with anemia. Discussion: Incidence of malignant tumor is very high. The incidence of malignancy was 34% in the series of aged anemia. The chance of gene mutation increased as patients\u2019 age getting older. When to diagnose aged anemia, we should better to consider that the primary disease is tumor maybe, and look for tumor carefully. Mechanism of anemia in patients with tumor Gastrointestinal tumor with chronic bleeding that can result in anemia. But, there is serious anemia without bleeding in our series. There were some different chronic diseases in 34 cases of tumor. Researchers have discovered that structural and metabolic disorders were detected in mature erythrocytes in patients with and without anemia in stomach cancer. Anemia development pathways were dependent on enhanced hemolysis of circulating erythrocytes and influx of immature cells from the bone marrow. Complication of etiology in aged anemia Etiological diseases of aged anemia is different and complicate. The major of aged anemia has two or more primary diseases. The primary presenting of gastrointestinal tumor maybe is iron deficiency anemia. The tumor with anemia can result from nutritional deficiency at advance. For example, there were vitamin B12 or/and folic acid 8 cases in our aged series. Some anemia patients in our series complicated cardiac disease, stroke, and bone fracture. 2 cases of G6PD deficiency had primarily diagnosed when they suffered from infection at very old age, 70 years or more in these aged anemia. There are 100 million G6PD in whole world, the incidence is very high especially in Africa and South China. Diagnosis should make as soon as possible. Many advanced tumors were incurable. About 20 per cent of patients with carcinoma of the colon or rectum present with metastatic disease. Surgeons are frequently asked to consider resection or other operative procedures in these patients for palliation. But, average survival was 11.2 months for operative patients versus 6.5 months for nonoperative patients (P < 0.05). So we should better discover tumor anemia and differentiate from other benign anemia in the aged anemia as soon as possible for curable section. To pay attention to treat of etiological diseases is very important for aged anemia patients.",
