    "abstract_text": "Background : Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a distinct type of non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma characterized by being incurable with a low response rate and short progression free survival when treated with conventional chemotherapy agents. Lenalidomide (Revlimid\u00ae), an immunomodulatory drug, is approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a del(q5) cytogenetic abnormality. Lenalidomide has also shown activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Aim: To determine the activity and safety of lenalidomide in relapsed/refractory MCL. Methods: Patients with relapsed/refractory MCL and measurable disease \u2265 2 cm after at least 1 prior treatment regimen were eligible. Patients received 25 mg lenalidomide orally once daily on Days 1\u201321 every 28 days and continued therapy for 52 weeks as tolerated or until disease progression. Response and progression were evaluated using the IWLRC methodology. Results : Fifteen patients with MCL were enrolled. Median age was 67 (45\u201384) and 7 were female. Median time from diagnosis to lenalidomide was 5.1 (0.7\u201312.7) years and median number of prior treatment regimens was 4 (2\u20136). Eight patients (53%) exhibited an objective response (1 complete response (CR), 1 complete response unconfirmed (CRu) and 6 partial responses (PR)), 2 had stable disease (SD) and 5 had progressive disease (PD). All eight responses were in eleven patients having a tumor burden < 50 cm 2 and a time since last rituximab therapy of \u2265 230 days. No responses were achieved in four patients having a tumor burden \u2265 50 cm 2 or a time since last rituximab therapy of < 230 days. Four of 5 patients (80%) with a prior stem cell transplant responded. Progression free survival [PFS] is 5.7 months and ongoing. Seven patients (47%) required at least one dose reduction with a median time to first dose reduction of 2.3 months (1.2\u20134.9). Grade 4 adverse events were neutropenia (13%), thrombocytopenia (13%), and thromboembolism (13%). Most common Grade 3 adverse events were neutropenia (33%) and leukopenia (20%). Conclusion : Lenalidomide oral monotherapy produced a 53% response rate in relapsed/refractory MCL with manageable side effects.",
