    "abstract_text": "Cell cycle checkpoints are implemented to safeguard our genome and the deregulation of which results in human cancers. Hence, it is of great significance to discover and investigate novel key constituents of the mammalian DNA damage response network. Human chromosome band 11q23 translocation disrupting the MLL gene leads to poor prognostic leukemias. MLL is a transcription co-activator that maintains HOX gene expression. The importance of HOX gene deregulation in MLL leukemogenesis has been intensively investigated. However, physiological murine MLL leukemia knockin models have indicated that incurred HOX gene aberration alone is insufficient to initiate MLL leukemia. Thus, additional signaling pathway must be involved, which remains to be discovered. Our recent studies demonstrated an intimate relationship between MLL and the cell cycle( Takeda et al. 2006 , Genes & Development , 20 , 2397 \u20132409 ; Liu et al. 2007 , Genes & Development , 21 , 2385 \u20132398 ). More importantly, our studies uncovered a critical role of MLL in executing the S phase checkpoint. We showed: Over-expression of MLL induces an S phase block. MLL accumulates in the S phase upon DNA damage. MLL deficiency results in radioresistant DNA synthesis (RDS) and chromatid-type chromosomal abnormalities, two signature characteristics of S phase checkpoint defects. We further determined the underlying mechanisms concerning the DNA damage-induced MLL accumulation. Our data showed that MLL is phosphorylated after DNA damage, which in turn blocks its degradation by SCF Skp2 in the S phase and results in the ultimate accumulation. Our data revealed the link between MLL and the S phase checkpoint, which provides novel insights into the mammalian cell cycle checkpoint network and human leukemia pathogenesis. Future studies utilizing murine leukemia models will be performed to examine whether MLL translocation compromises the S phase checkpoint and if the resulted dysfunction contributes to MLL leukemogenesis."
