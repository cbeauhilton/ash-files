    "abstract_text": "Differences in baseline features and follow-up among patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) according to age at diagnosis have been recently reported in cohorts from clinical controlled trials (Castagnetti F et al, 2015). To evaluate this issue in a real-life setting, we revised 207 consecutive CML patients treated at our Institution with imatinib frontline from 6/2002 to 6/2013, dividing them in young adults (>20 <45 years) (YA), middle-aged adults (\u226545 <65 years) (MA) and elderly (\u226565 years) (EL). The main features at baseline of the whole cohort and of the 3 age groups are reported in the Table. Table.  . ALL . YA . MA . EL . p .

The number of events (permanent discontinuation due to toxicity, primary or secondary resistance, any death for CML related or unrelated causes) was lower in the MA group [8 (11.1%) vs 21 (34.4%) in YA and 28 (37.8%) in EL, p=0.001]: no difference was observed in the rate of evolution to blastic phase [3 (4.9%) in YA, 1 (1.4%) in MA and 2 (2.7%) in EL, p=0.478]. The number of deaths was higher in the EL group [12 (16.2%) vs 2 (3.2%) in YA and 0 in MA, p 5 cm) compared to aged patients, who have often concomitant diseases and make routinely blood analyses: however, a more aggressive biology of CML in YA could not be excluded and warrants further investigations.
