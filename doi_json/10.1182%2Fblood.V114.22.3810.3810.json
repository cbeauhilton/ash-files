    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3810 Poster Board III-746 PURPOSE Transfusion-related iron overload and its consequences are emerging challenges in chronically transfused patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or aplastic anemia (AA). The clinical data on specific benefits of deferasirox in transfusion-related iron overload patients with MDS or AA has been limited. METHODS: We have prospectively investigated the efficacy of deferasirox by serial measurement of s-ferritin level and LIC by R 2 -MRI in transfusional iron overload patients with MDS or AA. RESULTS: A total of 79 patients with de novo MDS (n = 29) or idiopathic AA (n = 50) showing serum ferritin level over 1,000ng/ml were enrolled from 23 institutes. Mean value of s-ferritin level in enrolled patients was 4,788 ng/ml in MDS and 4,188 ng/ml in AA at the time of deferasirox initiation. Mean value of LIC was 24.4 mg Fe/g dry weight in MDS and 22.4 mg Fe/g dry weight in AA. Deferasirox was given orally at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day for at least 6 months to all patients and was withheld If the s-ferritin falls below 500 ng/ml. Over the study period, patients with MDS or AA received a mean of 3.7 and 2.7 units RBC per month, respectively. After 12 months of medication, s-ferritin level significantly decreased by 1824.0 ng/ml form baseline values, a reduction of 38.1% for patients with MDS (p<0.0001) and significantly decreased by 3559.1 ng/ml (85.0%) for patients with AA (p<0.0001). LIC decreased by 11.2 mg Fe/g dry weight, a reduction of 35.7% for patients with MDS, and significantly decreased by 8.1 mg Fe/g dry weight, a reduction of 27.6% for patients with AA (p=0.0028). The patients with lower transfusional requirements (<4 units/month) during the study showed significantly more reduction of LIC level than those with higher requirements (\u22654 units/month) (35.7% vs. 2.8%; p<0.0001). The most common drug-related adverse events (AE) were gastrointestinal disturbances and non-progressive increase in s-creatinine, however, AE were transient and mild-to-moderate in severity. All death was ascribed to disease-related causes including cytopenia in nine (11.4%) and disease progression in one (1.3%). CONCLUSION: Deferasirox is effective in reducing LIC and s-ferritin level in transfusional iron overload patients with MDS or AA, even with ongoing transfusion requirement, and well tolerated.
