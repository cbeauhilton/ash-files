The clinical data on specific benefits of deferasirox in transfusion-related iron overload patients with MDS or AA has been limited. METHODS: We have prospectively investigated the efficacy of deferasirox by serial measurement of s-ferritin level and LIC by R 2 -MRI in transfusional iron overload patients with MDS or AA. RESULTS: A total of 79 patients with de novo MDS (n = 29) or idiopathic AA (n = 50) showing serum ferritin level over 1,000ng/ml were enrolled from 23 institutes. Mean value of s-ferritin level in enrolled patients was 4,788 ng/ml in MDS and 4,188 ng/ml in AA at the time of deferasirox initiation. Mean value of LIC was 24.4 mg Fe/g dry weight in MDS and 22.4 mg Fe/g dry weight in AA. Deferasirox was given orally at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day for at least 6 months to all patients and was withheld If the s-ferritin falls below 500 ng/ml. Over the study period, patients with MDS or AA received a mean of 3.7 and 2.7 units RBC per month, respectively. After 12 months of medication, s-ferritin level significantly decreased by 1824.0 ng/ml form baseline values, a reduction of 38.1% for patients with MDS (p<0.0001) and significantly decreased by 3559.1 ng/ml (85.0%) for patients with AA (p<0.0001). LIC decreased by 11.2 mg Fe/g dry weight, a reduction of 35.7% for patients with MDS, and significantly decreased by 8.1 mg Fe/g dry weight, a reduction of 27.6% for patients with AA (p=0.0028). The patients with lower transfusional requirements (<4 units/month) during the study showed significantly more reduction of LIC level than those with higher requirements (\u22654 units/month) (35.7% vs. 2.8%; p<0.0001). The most common drug-related adverse events (AE) were gastrointestinal disturbances and non-progressive increase in s-creatinine, however, AE were transient and mild-to-moderate in severity. All death was ascribed to disease-related causes including cytopenia in nine (11.4%) and disease progression in one (1.3%). CONCLUSION: Deferasirox is effective in reducing LIC and s-ferritin level in transfusional iron overload patients with MDS or AA, even with ongoing transfusion requirement, and well tolerated.
