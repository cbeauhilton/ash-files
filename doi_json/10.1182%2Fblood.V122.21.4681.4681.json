    "abstract_text": "Introduction Sickle cell anemia is a disease which is characterized with hemolytic anemia, hypercoagulopathy and painful crisis. Microparticles are 0,1-1 \u00b5m sized little membrane particles which are derived during activation or apoptotic phase of cell cycle. It is reported that microparticles are increased in many systemic disease including sickle cell anemia. Aim In this study we aimed to investigate the role of microparticles on during crisis and non-crisis periods in sickle cell anemia patients. Materials and method Twenty nine patients, following by Cukurova University, Department of Pediatric Hematology, are included in this study. Blood samples were collected in 26 of these patients in non-crisis period. Control group formed with 18 healthy children without any systemic disease. Complete blood count, hemoglobin electrophoresis and biochemical parameters were studied in both groups. Also patients\u2019 total microparticle levels, erythrocyte (CD235a), endothelial (CD106), monocyte (CD14) particle levels and tissue factor expressing (CD142) microparticle levels were studied by flow cytometry and whole data was statistically analyzed. Findings Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were significantly low in sickle cell anemia patients (p0,05). There was not any significant relation with frequency of crisis and microparticle levels (p>0,05). Microparticle levels were low in patients whose were taking hydroxiurea treatment comparing with non-hydroxiurea treatment but this data was not statistically significant (p>0,05). Result As a result we found high levels of total microparticle, erythrocyte and monocyte microparticles in sickle cell anemia patients during painful crisis period. This important clue of crises was need further studies in order to understand the effect of microparticles on pathophysiology of sickle cell anemia.
