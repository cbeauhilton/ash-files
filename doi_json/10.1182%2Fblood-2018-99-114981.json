    "abstract_text": "Small molecule protein arginine methyltransferase inhibitors (PRMTi) are being actively pursued for the treatment of a variety of cancers; however, the mechanisms of response to PRMTi remain poorly understood. CARM1, also known as PRMT4, is significantly overexpressed in AML, as well as many solid tumors, and regulates myeloid differentiation. We have shown the dependency of AML cells, but not normal blood cells, on CARM1 activity, based on CARM1 knockout, CARM1 knockdown, and chemical inhibition (Greenblatt et al. Cancer Cell 2018). These experiments showed that CARM1 regulates essential processes in leukemia cells, and is critical for leukemic transformation. Although several small molecule inhibitors of CARM1 have been reported recently, many display a lack of selectivity for CARM1 or fail to produce a biological response. The recent discovery of potent and selective CARM1 inhibitors (Drew et al., 2017), has made it possible to investigate the implications of pharmacological inhibition of CARM1 in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, a selective CARM1 inhibitor, EPZ025654, reduced the methylation of a CARM1 substrate, BAF155, in a time and concentration-dependent manner, while the specific histone targets of CARM1 remained unchanged. Translocation (8;21) AML samples in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group cohort, have significantly higher CARM1 expression compared to normal CD34+ controls. This led us to hypothesize that CARM1 is a direct target of the AML1-ETO fusion protein. Therefore, we assessed whether EPZ025654 could inhibit AML1-ETO driven gene expression. AML1-ETO specific target genes showed significant changes in expression following EPZ025654 treatment. AML1-ETO positive patient samples also displayed decreased colony formation in methylcellulose and increased myeloid differentiation in response to CARM1 inhibition. We next evaluated EZM2302, a compound structurally related to EPZ025654, that is highly orally bioavailable and is well tolerated in mice (Drew et al., 2017). We generated AE9a-GFP primary transplantation mice and treated them with 100 mg/kg of EZM2302 or vehicle twice-daily (BID). The inhibitor treated mice showed significantly improved survival as well as fewer GFP+ cells in the peripheral blood over time. GFP+ AE9a bone marrow cells also showed decreased colony formation in vitro and induced macrophage differentiation in methylcellulose. GFP+ cells were isolated by FACS and submitted for RNA-sequencing. Flow cytometry analysis post-treatment revealed a significant downregulation of c-Kit and increased differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Resistance to epigenetic targeted therapeutics has been observed, often through the induction of kinase signaling pathways. Therefore, we explored synergistic combinations with CARM1 inhibition using RNA-sequencing and proteomics analysis in leukemia cell lines. We used L1000 profiling (Subramanian et al., 2017) to simultaneously profile the transcriptional response of 18 AML cell line and CD34+ cells after 6 days of treatment. The AML1-ETO positive cell lines exhibited an IC50 in the 0.4-3 \u03bcM range, while CD34+ cells and several AML cell lines appeared to be resistant to CARM1 inhibition. While gene expression changes resulting from alterations in RNA stability were observed, the most significant differences between sensitive and resistant cell lines were genes associated with the regulation of cell cycle progression. Gene expression changes were evaluated over time in an AML1-ETO positive cell line, SKNO-1. SKNO-1 cell lines showed an upregulation of a gene expression signature associated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, with the most significant gene expression changes occurring 7-14 days post treatment. We simultaneously profiled these cells using multiplexed kinase inhibitor beads (MIBs) and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to compare kinase expression and activity in response to CARM1 inhibition over time. A comparison of this response to chemical perturbation signatures in the L1000 database, identified several chemical inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis that could reverse the gene expression changes induced by CARM1 inhibition. This finding elucidated a response mechanism for CARM inhibition and a synergistic therapeutic strategy that has the potential to improve CARM1 directed therapy.
