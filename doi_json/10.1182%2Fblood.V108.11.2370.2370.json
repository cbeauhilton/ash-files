    "abstract_text": "Following primary infection, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes life long persistence in the host IgD \u2212 CD27 + memory B cell compartment rather than the IgD + CD27 + marginal zone (MZ)-like or the IgD + CD27 \u2212 nai\u0308ve B cell compartments. One possible explanation for such exclusive persistence in memory B cells is that EBV preferentially infects memory B cells. Alternatively, the virus may infect all B cell subsets but then drive MZ and nai\u0308ve B cells to acquire the Ig isotype-switched phenotype and hypermutated Ig genotype of memory cells. Here we ask whether there is any evidence for one or other hypothesis from in vitro experiments. B cells from healthy donor blood samples were FACS sorted on the basis of IgD/CD27 expression into nai\u0308ve, MZ, and memory B cell subsets with purities of >99%, >97% and >98% respectively. Analysis of the IgVH sequence further confirmed purity of the FACS sorted B cell subsets. Accordingly, 102 of 105 IgVH sequences amplified from purified nai\u0308ve B cells were germ-line where as the vast majority of sequences amplified from MZ and memory B cells were mutated. All three B cell subsets expressed equal amounts of CD21 (EBV receptor on B cells), bound similar amounts of virus, and transformed with equal efficiency to establish B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in vitro. Nai\u0308ve B cell transformants upregulated CD27 expression but retained the IgM + , IgD + phenotype as determined by FACS analysis and RT-PCR; MZ-B derived LCLs likewise were IgM + , IgD + , CD27 + ; and memory-B derived LCLs were consistently CD27 + , IgD \u2212 and expressed either IgG, IgA or in some cases IgM. Therefore, EBV infection per se did not induce class switching. However, both nai\u0308ve and MZ-B derived LCLs could still be induced to switch to IgG in the presence of CD40 ligand and IL-4; signals that are normally provided by T cells in vivo. To assess if EBV infection might drive Ig hypermutation, we carried out IgVH sequence analysis on the nai\u0308ve-B derived LCL clones. Interestingly, 42 of 114 clonal IgVH sequences amplified from nai\u0308ve-B derived LCLs had 3 or more mutations and the patterns of mutation seen were consistent with that produced by somatic hypermutation (SHM). Furthermore, within some nai\u0308ve-B cell derived LCL clones, there were both germ-line and mutated sequences all sharing the same VDJ rearrangement (CDR3 sequence), again implying sequence diversification following EBV transformation of a single nai\u0308ve B cell. Some intraclonal variation of the already hypermutated IgVH sequence was also noted in memory and MZ-B derived LCLs further suggesting ongoing mutational activity. Consistent with this, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) expression was upregulated in transformants as assessed by real time RT-PCR. Our in vitro data is therefore compatible with a model of EBV persistence where the virus infects all mature B cell subsets but then drives infected nai\u0308ve B cells to acquire a memory genotype by inducing SHM. In addition, EBV infected nai\u0308ve and MZ-B cells may undergo Ig class switching to acquire the IgD \u2212 CD27 + memory phenotype in the presence of T cell help in vivo. EBV\u2019s ability to induce SHM may also contribute to the lymphomagenic potential of the virus in addition to its B cell transforming and growth promoting properties.",
