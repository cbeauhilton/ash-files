    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1172 Acquired aplastic anemia is an immune-mediated disease where destruction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow results in severe and life-threatening pancytopenia. Thymoglobulin \u00ae is often used as immunosuppressive therapy in this disease with up to 80 percent of patients responding to a combination of Thymoglobulin and cyclosporine. In an effort to better understand the activities and mechanism of action of Thymoglobulin we developed a mouse model of immune-mediated aplastic anemia and evaluated a murine surrogate of Thymoglobulin \u00ae , rabbit anti-mouse thymocyte globulin (mATG) in this model. We modified a graft-versus-host (GVH)-induced model described in the literature (Bloom, et al., 2004) utilizing HSC-depleted spleen cells transferred from C57BL/6 into CByB6F1 mice instead of lymph node cell transfer. Our modified model shows a cell dose-dependent increase in pancytopenia and lethality. Mice receiving a high dose (100\u00d710 6 ) of HSC-depleted splenocytes experienced severe pancytopenia and rapid death occurring around day 21 whereas mice receiving lower doses (70\u00d710 6 , 35\u00d710 6 and 17\u00d710 6 ) of cells showed progressively less pancytopenia and lethality as the dose of cells decreased. Histopathology also showed marked loss of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow with little evidence of GVHD in other tissues. Prophylactic administration of mATG (25mg/kg, 2x, day 0 and 3) to mice given high doses of HSC-depleted splenocytes (100\u00d710 6 ) resulted in a significant improvement in pancytopenia and survival (70%) in this model. Interestingly, therapeutic administration of mATG was more effective when given later relative to disease induction. Delivery of mATG (25mg/kg, 2x, three days apart) starting on day 3 showed some delay in disease progression (day 30 vs day 21) and mATG started on day 6 slightly increased survival (40%). However, mice receiving mATG starting on days 10 or 14 showed a much greater overall survival of 100% and 60%, respectively, with full rebound of hematopoietic cells in the blood to normal levels. The complete response observed with later mATG administration (day 10 or day 14) mimics the treatment and response of patients given Thymoglobulin\u00ae. In summary, we have established a novel model of HSC-depleted splenocyte induction of bone marrow failure in mice that is responsive to therapeutic ATG administration. Studies in this model will aid in further understanding the mechanism of ATG in aplastic anemia and may contribute to the development of potential new therapies.
