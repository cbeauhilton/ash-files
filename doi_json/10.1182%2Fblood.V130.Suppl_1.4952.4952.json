    "abstract_text": "Background : Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was widely used. Rapid and effective reconstruction would directly affect the effects of transplantation (including survival rate, blood routine examination and implantation rate of donor cells). In previous research (Blood 2015 126:5404), we developed a novel cell transplantation technique named magnetism-induced cell target transplantation (MagIC-TT). The purpose of this research is to explore whether MagIC-TT could promote hematopoietic recovery after autologous bone marrow transplantation. Methods: 1) 66 female C57BL/6 mice with the condition of specific pathogen free (SPF) were randomly divided into MagIC-TT group and non-MagIC-TT group. All recipient mice were irradiated by 7.5 Gy X-ray one day before transplantation. 2) eGFP+ bone marrow hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HS/PCs) were flushed out from the femur, tibia and humerus of the male C57BL/6-Tg (CAG-eGFP) transgenic mice. 3) Magnetized CD45-eGFP+ cells (donor cells) were obtained after a series of counting, centrifuging, magnetizing and positive sorting. 4) Magnetized donor cells were directly injected into femoral cavities of recipient mice with or without temporary magnetic field (MagIC-TT or non-MagIC-TT group). 5) Survival rate, blood routine examination, the percentage of eGFP+ cells in peripheral blood and pathological examination of the injected femur were analyzed and compared between both groups. Results: 1) Survival curves analysis (Fig.1): at 20 th day post-transplantation, the overall survival rate of MagIC-TT group was 72.7% vs 48.5% in non-MagIC-TT group (P=0.083). 2) Blood routine examination: the amount of white blood cells (WBC) in MagIC-TT group was more than non-MagIC-TT group and its P value was 0.03 (Fig.2a). The amounts of hemoglobin (Hb) and platelet (PLT) in both groups weren't shown any significant difference (Fig.2b, Fig.2c). 3) eGFP+ donor cells ratio of peripheral blood (Fig.3): the percentage of eGFP+ cells were gradually increased both MagIC-TT group and non-MagIC-TT group after transplantation, the percentage of the MagIC-TT group seemed to be higher than that of non-MagIC-TT group (P=0.063). 4) Femoral pathological examination: the amount of eGFP+ cells of injected femur in MagIC-TT group was more than those of non-MagIC-TT group at 24 hours post-transplantation. C onclusion: MagIC-TT could enhance donor cells targeted implantation and promote WBC recovery after autologous bone marrow transplantation in C57BL/6 mice.
