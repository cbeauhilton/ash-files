    "abstract_text": "Stable and permanent hematopoiesis is established from the most primitive long-term self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells ( LT - HSC ), which can give rise to more differentiated short-term (ST-HSC) and multi-potent progenitors (MPP) . Progenitors further differentiate into more committed cells that can generate the mature lymphoid and myeloid lineages. In order to maintain a normal hematopoietic system, HSCs must be properly regulated. We previously cloned Ubiquitin Specific Protease 18 (USP18/UBP43) during analysis of hematopoietic cells of t(8;21) AML fusion protein AML1-ETO knock-in mice (Liu et al, 1999 Mol Cell Biol 19:3029-3038; Schwer et al, 2000 Genomics 65, 44-52). However, its function in hematopoiesis, especially in hematopoietic stem cells, has not been carefully examined. We show here that depletion of Usp18 in C57/BL6 mice leads to death at embryonic days 13.5-14.5 with less fetal liver cellularity. To examine the precise role of Usp18 in vivo, we generated Usp18 conditional knockout mice ( Usp18 f/f ). Survival analyses of Usp18 f/- crossed with Usp18 f/+ Vav-iCre revealed that the embryonic lethality of Usp18 -deficient mice is due to defects in hematopoiesis. To examine the hematopoietic potential of fetal liver cells of Usp18 -deficient mice, we conducted a colony forming assay using the E12.5 fetal livers. All types of colonies as well as the number of total cells from colonies were substantially reduced in Usp18 -/- fetal liver compared to control, indicating that the blood progenitor cells of Usp18 -/- fetal liver are not fully functional. To assess whether Usp18 is required for fetal liver HSC maintenance, we determined the frequency of HSCs in the fetal liver of Usp18 +/+ , Usp18 +/- , and Usp18 -/- . We detected the Lin - Sca-1 + c-Kit + (LSK) cell population, which is HSC-enriched population in fetal livers, in mice of all three genotypes. Recent studies indicate that the most primitive LT-HSC population in fetal livers includes ESAM positive (LSK CD48 - CD150 + ESAM + ) stem cells (Ooi et al, 2009 Stem Cells 27:653-661; Pietras et al, 2014 JEM 211:245-262). Both the frequency and absolute numbers of the LT-HSC population in Usp18 -/- fetal livers were appreciably reduced compared to wild-type. Taken together, we conclude that Usp18 is indispensable for fetal liver HSC maintenance. We then addressed whether Usp18 is required for the HSC maintenance in adult mice by analyzing the frequency of HSCs in UBC ER -Cre negative or positive Usp18 f/- bone marrow cells. After tamoxifen injections, we observed a significant reduction in the frequency of the LT-HSC population in Usp18 f/- UBC ER -Cre positive bone marrow cells compared to Usp18 f/- UBC ER -Cre negative ones. Consistent with these results, Usp18 f/- UBC ER -Cre positive bone marrow cells were much less competitive than Cre negative cells by competitive bone marrow transplantation assay. Finally, to examine whether the suppression of Usp18 in the leukemic cells provides a survival benefit, we used secondary-transplanted mice receiving Usp18 f/f UBC ER -Cre positive AML1-ETO9a leukemia cells (5 \u00d7 10 5 EGFP+ cells) isolated from primary transplanted mice. The tamoxifen treatment was initiated 3 weeks after transplantation. All the mice in the vehicle injected group (n = 7) succumbed to leukemia within a week after treatment started. However, mice treated with tamoxifen (n = 7) showed a longer survival time. Five of seven mice are still alive after 5 weeks of bone marrow transplantation, demonstrating the critical role of USP18 in maintenance of leukemia stem cells. Collectively, we conclude that Usp18 is essential for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, and specific modulating activity of USP18 in leukemic cells may be considered as an effective therapeutic approach.
