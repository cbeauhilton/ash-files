    "abstract_text": "Introduction Activating FLT3 mutations are found in 30% of AML patients. Internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations are most common, and are associated with poor prognosis. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) were shown to be effective in clinical trials. However, complete remissions are rare, responses are short-lived, and the majority of patients display primary or secondary resistance to FLT3 inhibition. In FLT3 kinase inhibitor resistant, FLT3-ITD positive cell lines, we identified a direct interaction between FLT3-ITD and IL-3R\u03b2c. We therefore sought to characterize this interaction and determine its' role in FLT3-ITD oncogenic signaling. Methods Drug sensitive BA/F3 FLT3-ITD cells and sublines resistant to FLT3 TKIs were subjected to analysis of activated IL-3R\u03b2c - JAK1/2 - STAT signaling by PCR, Western-Blot (WB) and Immunoprecipitation (IP). Interaction studies were performed in vitro using IVT FLT3-ITD and GST IL-3R\u03b2c, and in cell lines using \u03b32A cells transfected with human FLT3-ITD and human IL-3R\u03b2c, human MOLM13 and MV4-11 AML cell lines, and primary AML patient samples by WB, IP and proximity ligation assay (PLA). Mapping experiments were performed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) transduced with FLT3-ITD and flag-IL-3R\u03b2c full-length or cytoplasmic Y to F mutant constructs. Knockdown-experiments were performed in BA/F3 cells with stably transfected FLT3-ITD and inducable IL-3R\u03b2c shRNA. Results In TKI resistant FLT3-ITD positive cell-lines that did not harbor secondary FLT3 mutations inducing TKI resistance, we observed phosphorylation of IL-3R\u03b2c in 5/16 resistant lines (30%) in the presence of FLT3 TKI. In these cells, IL-3R\u03b2c phosphorylation was mediated by an activating JAK1 V658F mutation that bypasses FLT3-ITD dependent IL-3R\u03b2c phosphorylation. Thus, IL-3R\u03b2c in FLT3-ITD expressing cells mediates JAK1/2-dependent TKI resistance. Of note in inhibitor sensitive cells, IL-3R\u03b2c interacted with and was phosphorylated by FLT3-ITD in a JAK1/2 independent manner, suggesting that IL-3R\u03b2c participates in FLT3-ITD dependent oncogeneic signaling. Indeed, in IL-3R\u03b2c and JAK2 deficient \u03b32A cells, expression of human FLT3-ITD was sufficient to induce interaction with and phosphorylation of human IL-3R\u03b2c. In human FLT3-ITD-positive AML cell lines MOLM13 and MV4-11, IL-3R\u03b2c phosphorylation occurred in a FLT3-ITD dependent fashion and IL-3R\u03b2c interacted with FLT3-ITD. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) experiments detected FTL3-ITD and IL-3R\u03b2c in close proximity suggesting a direct interaction of both proteins in MOLM13 and MV4-11 cells, as well as in primary cells from FLT3-ITD positive AML patients. Interaction studies revealed that binding to FLT3-ITD occurred independent of IL-3R\u03b2c cytoplasmic tyrosines, and phosphorylation of IL-3R\u03b2c by FLT3-ITD did not require the presence of IL-3R\u03b1c. Preliminary results from knock down experiments in FLT3-ITD expressing BA/F3 cells indicated that knock-down of IL-3R\u03b2c renders cells more susceptible to FLT3 TKI inhibition. Conclusion These data suggest an entirely novel model of FLT3-ITD \"physiologically\" employing IL-3R\u03b2c as signaling intermediate, and IL-3R\u03b2c serving as a signaling module mediating JAK1/2-dependent TKI resistance. These findings point toward the significance of IL-3R\u03b2c for FLT3-ITD dependent transformation and treatment resistance, supporting the relevance of IL-3R\u03b2c as a possible treatment target in FLT3-ITD positive AML.
