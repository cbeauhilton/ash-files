    "abstract_text": "Abstract 76 Mutated variants of C/EBP\u03b1 are expressed in approximately 15% of AML cases. We have previously shown that C/EBP\u03b1 and its AML mutants interact directly with NF-\u03baB p50 through the basic region. Through binding to a DNA \u03baB site they activate anti-apoptotic genes including BCL2 and FLIP, inhibiting both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. These effects do not depend on DNA binding but rather on the integrity of the basic region, which is rarely altered in C/EBP\u03b1 AML oncoproteins. Interaction with p50 is necessary for the C/EBP\u03b1 induction of bcl-2 and FLIP but not of myeloid differentiation genes. In addition, NF-\u03baB p50 binds and activates the CEBPA gene in myeloid cells. We now report that C/EBP\u03b1 or its AML mutants, including a leukemia-derived leucine zipper mutant that cannot bind DNA directly (C/EBP\u03b1LZ), bind in vivo to the nfkb1 (p50) promoter. Using Ba/F3 cell lines expressing an estrogen receptor fusion of C/EBP\u03b1 or the C/EBP\u03b1LZ mutant we demonstrate induction of p50 mRNA within 7 hrs after the addition of estradiol. A basic region mutant (C/EBP\u03b1BR) that cannot bind the p50 protein did not activate nfkb1 transcription. Importantly, the translation inhibitor cycloheximide did not prevent nfkb1 induction by C/EBP\u03b1, suggesting direct regulation of nfkb1 transcription by C/EBP\u03b1. Remarkably, C/EBP\u03b1 did not induce p65 RNA expression. A minimal 200 bp nfkb1 promoter, containing \u03baB but not C/EBP binding sites, is trans-activated by C/EBP\u03b1 9 fold, or 33 fold by the C/EBP\u03b1LZ AML oncoprotein. The variant C/EBP\u03b1BR fails to trans-activate the nfkb1 promoter. Together, these data indicate that the gene encoding NF-\u03baB p50 is a direct target of C/EBP\u03b1. NF-\u03baB p65 is held in the cytoplasm I\u03baB\u03b1 and enters the nucleus to bind DNA predominantly as p65:p50 heterodimers upon cell stimulation. In contrast, p50 homodimers are present in the nucleus bound to chromatin in resting cells and inhibit transcription due to the lack of a trans-activation domain and the recruitment of co-repressors and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Therefore, the induction of p50 by C/EBP\u03b1 would be expected to result in diminished expression of target genes. However, our data indicates that C/EBP\u03b1 and p50 synergistically activate anti-apoptotic genes. Remarkably, ChIP analysis demonstrated that C/EBP\u03b1 induction from the metallothionein promoter in Ba/F3 cells diminishes the occupation of the endogenous BCL2 and FLIP promoters by HDAC1 but not HDAC3, although induction of C/EBP\u03b1 expression did not alter the cellular content of either HDAC. In contrast, occupancy of Bcl-3, another p50 transcriptional cofactor, on these promoters did not change. In transiently transfected 293T cells we confirmed that p50 binds to HDAC1 in a co-immunoprecipitation reaction. Remarkably, interaction between p50 and HDAC1 was disrupted in the presence of co-expressed C/EBP\u03b1, C/EBP\u03b2, or the AML mutants C/EBP\u03b1LZ, or C/EBP\u03b1p30. In a striking correlation with our previous findings, the C/EBP\u03b1BR basic region mutant of C/EBP\u03b1 that does not bind p50 did not interrupt this interaction. As an important control, we confirmed that HDAC1 does not interact directly with C/EBP\u03b1 or its mutants, indicating that C/EBP\u03b1 competes with HDAC1 for interaction with p50. Interestingly, the AML-derived C/EBP\u03b1LZ or C/EBP\u03b1p30 oncoproteins, but not wild-type C/EBP\u03b1, interrupt the interaction between HDAC3 and p50. This suggests a greater capacity for these leukemia mutants to de-repress NF-\u03baB target genes compared with C/EBP\u03b1 itself. In summary, C/EBP\u03b1 cooperates with NF-\u03baB p50 to induce several anti-apoptotic genes, thereby providing a survival advantage to the leukemic blasts. C/EBP\u03b1 and p50 reciprocally regulate each other's expression at the transcriptional level, establishing a positive feedback relationship. Moreover, C/EBP\u03b1 or its AML mutants displaces HDAC1, and the C/EBP\u03b1 oncoproteins displace HDAC3, from NF-\u03baB p50 homodimers bound to anti-apoptotic genes, contributing to NF-\u03baB dysregulation in leukemia. Our data underscore the concept that the C/EBP\u03b1:NF-\u03baB p50 complex is a potential novel therapeutic target in AML, and the C/EBP\u03b2:p50 complex may functional similarly in lymphomas and in other malignancies where C/EBP\u03b2 rather than C/EBP\u03b1 expression predominates.
