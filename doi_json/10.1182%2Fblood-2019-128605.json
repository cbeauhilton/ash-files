    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) based cellular-immunotherapies have demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in haematological malignancies. However, the progress of cellular-immunotherapy for the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) has failed to gain momentum due to the lack of targetable tumour specific antigens. CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in lymphoid and myeloid cells with high expression in plasma B-cells, and is a well validated target for anti-CD38 therapy in Myeloma. A recent study has furthermore shown that a proportion of AML patients express CD38 on their leukemic blasts. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor DR4 is another targetable antigen which has been shown to be expressed in 70% of AML patients. In this study, we investigate the therapeutic efficacy of \"affinity-optimized\" variant(s) of CD38 CAR and membrane bound TRAIL on NK-cell based platforms which can target AML blasts with high expression of CD38 (CD38 high AML). The CAR variant is a CAR which binds with lower affinity to CD38 expressed on healthy immune cells such as CD38 positive NK cells, while targeting CD38 high AML. The membrane bound TRAIL variant (TRAIL 4c9 ) is a mutant which binds with higher affinity to TRAIL-DR4 on AML cells, whilst avoiding binding to decoy receptors. We hypothesize that genetically modifying NK cells to express \"affinity optimized\" CD38 CARand/or TRAIL 4c9 can effectively eliminate CD38 high AML cells. Methods: AML cell lines THP-1, U937, and KG1a were immunophenotyped for CD38 and TRAIL-DR4 expression. Retrovirally transduced CD38 CAR-KHYG1 NK cells were used as immune effector cells and were co-cultured with AML cell lines in cytotoxicity assays. CD38 low AML cell line KG1a was pre-treated with 10nM all -trans- retinoic acid (ATRA) to upregulate CD38 expression and were subsequently co-cultured with CD38 CAR-KHYG1 in cytotoxicity assays. CD38 CAR-KHYG1 was also co-cultured with n=4 patient derived AML cells in cytotoxicity assays. Using Maxcyte GT electroporation system primary donor derived IL-2 activated NK cells were either mock electroporated, or electroporated with TRAIL 4c9 m-RNA orCD38 CAR m-RNA and subsequently co-cultured with THP-1 or ATRA pre-treated KG1a in a cytotoxicity assay. Expression of pro-apoptotic, anti-apoptotic and ligands for checkpoint inhibitory receptors was analysed by immunoblotting or flowcytometry. Results: Based on immunophenotyping, we classified AML cell lines as CD38 high (THP-1), CD38 moderate (U937) and CD38 low (KG1a). CD38 CAR-KHYG1 was significantly more cytotoxic than MOCK KHYG1 against CD38 high THP-1, at E:T ratios of 2.5:1, 5:1 and 10:1. CD38 CAR-KHYG1 were also more cytotoxic than MOCK KHYG1 against CD38 moderate U937 at multiple E:T ratios; albeit the increase in cytotoxicity was at a much lower level in comparison to THP-1 (Fig 1a). Pre-treatment of CD38 low KG1a cells with 10nM ATRA upregulated the cell surface expression of CD38, which were subsequently eliminated by CD38 CAR KHYG1 at E:T ratios of 2.5:1, 5:1 and 10:1. KG1a was intrinsically resistant to NK cells as compared to THP-1 and U937 (Fig 1b). This could partly be explained by the high intracellular expression of Bcl-xL, and higher cell surface expression of Nectin-1 and Sialic acid which are the ligands for checkpoint inhibitory receptors CD96 and Siglec-7/9 respectively on NK cell (Fig 1c). CD38 CAR-KHYG1 mounted a potent cytotoxic response against primary CD45 intermediate AML blasts ( n=4 patients ) at multiple E:T ratios, and the extent of CAR induced cytotoxicity correlated with the cell surface CD38 expression on the primary AML blasts ( R 2 =0.87 ) (Fig 1d,e). TRAIL 4c9 or CD38 CAR m-RNA electroporated primary donor-derived NK cells were also potent in eliminating THP-1 and ATRA pre-treated KG1a at multiple E:T ratios (Fig 1f). This demonstrates the potential of therapeutically treating AML patients, with high CD38 expression, with a combination of NK cells expressing \"affinity-optimized\" CD38 CAR and membrane bound TRAIL variant. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of an \"affinity-optimized\" CD38 CAR NK cell-based therapy, which can potentially be combined with membrane bound TRAIL expressing NK cells to target CD38 high AML. In patients with CD38 low expressing AML blasts, patients could be pre-treated with ATRA followed by the combination therapy of CD38 CAR and TRAIL expressing NK cells.
