    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3344 Background: Combined oral contraceptives (COC) containing estrogens and progestins are associated with a 2 to 4-fold increased risk of venous thromboembolic events. Progestin-only contraceptives are commonly prescribed to women with a higher risk for thrombosis, although a lower thrombotic risk than COC has not been clearly established. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies to estimate the risk ratio of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in women taking progesterone for the purpose of contraception. Materials and methods: We performed a literature search of cohort, case-control and randomized studies including women treated with progestin-only contraception compared with a no-hormone control group. All administration routes (oral, injectable and intra-uterine) were considered. The primary endpoint was the corrected risk ratio of VTE analyzed using a random effects model. Results: 1150 references were retrieved; 7 studies were retained for analysis. The summary estimate of the adjusted risk ratio of VTE for women taking a progestin for contraception versus no hormone was 1.02 (95% CI=0.76\u20131.37, p =0.89). Heterogeneity between studies was minimal (Q-value=7.1, I 2 =15.49 and p =0.31). An analysis combining the unadjusted odds ratios of VTE gave a similar result (OR=1.24, 95% CI=0.93\u20131.66, p =0.14). Analysis by subgroup suggests a higher risk of thrombotic events for individuals using an injectable progestin, with an estimated risk ratio of VTE equal to 2.67 (95% CI=1.29\u20135.53, p =0.008), compared to 0.87 (95% CI=0.53\u20131.42, p =0.58) for oral administration. Conclusions: Progestin-only oral formulations used for contraception do not appear to increase the risk of venous thromboembolic disease, although injectable administration was associated with an increased incidence of VTE relative to women not taking hormones that is comparable to the risk associated with COC.
