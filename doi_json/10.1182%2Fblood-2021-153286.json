    "abstract_text": "Introduction:  TP53 gene mutations (m TP53 ), found in up to 20% of MDS or AML pts and 30-40% of therapy-related (TR) MDS/AML cases, represent a distinct molecular cohort with poor outcomes. Hypomethylating agents (HMA) are the frontline standard of care, with CR rates of ~20% and median OS of < 12 months. APR-246 is a novel, first-in-class small molecule that reactivates the mutant p53 protein and targets cellular redox balance, ultimately inducing apoptosis and ferroptosis in m TP53 cancer cells. We previously reported the Phase 2 results of 2 parallel trials of APR-246+AZA (Sallman et al and Cluzeau et al., JCO 2021). We now report analyses of the combined Phase 2 cohorts and long-term follow-up. Methods: This is a multicenter, international collaboration of the US MDS clinical research consortium and the GFM of HMA-na\u00efve m TP53 higher-risk MDS, MDS/MPN and oligoblastic AML (\u2264 30% blasts) pts (NCT03072043/NCT03588078). Pts received APR-246 4500mg IV (days 1-4) + AZA 75 mg/m 2 SC/IV x 7 days (days 4-10 or 4-5 and 8-12) in 28-day cycles. Primary objective was CR rate by International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria. Secondary objectives included ORR, OS, outcome following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT), with serial high depth next generation sequencing (NGS, 0.1% cutoff) for evaluation of measurable residual disease (MRD). Results: As of July 15, 2021, 100 pts had been enrolled with a median age of 68 years (range, 34-87; 47% male). By WHO, 74 pts had MDS, 22 AML-MRC and 4 CMML/MDS-MPN; 83% complex karyotype (CK) and 88% were CK and/or biallelic for TP53 mutations; 92% had a TP53 missense mutation in the DNA binding domain. In 63 pts, TP53 was the only mutation detected (i.e. isolated m TP53 ). Median time on treatment was 6 cycles (1-25+) with 5 pts ongoing and 23 pts who proceeded to allo-HSCT. Non-hematologic treatment (Tx)-related adverse events (AEs) in \u226520% of pts included nausea/vomiting (58%), ataxia (26%), and dizziness (23%). Neurologic AEs were reversible in 100% of cases. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 37% of pts. Thirty and 60-day mortality was 1% (n=1) and 7% (n=7), respectively. Dose reductions of APR-246 and AZA occurred in 16% and 1% of pts, respectively, with only 1 treatment discontinuation due to a treatment-related AE. By intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, ORR by IWG was 69% with 43 CR, 1 PR, 10 marrow CR (mCR)+HI, 9 HI alone, and 6 with mCR. Of non-responders, 6 had stable disease and 7 pts had progressive disease. The median duration of CR/PR was 10.6 months (95% CI 8.8-12.3, 23+ months ongoing). CR/PR rate for MDS was 49% (36/74), 36% for AML (8/22) and 0% for MDS/MPN (0/4) with an ORR rate of 70%/64%/75%, respectively. Isolated m TP53 was predictive for a higher CR rate (52% vs 30%; P =.04). Patients who had biallelic TP53 or CK had a significantly higher CR rate vs pts without (49% vs 8%; P =0.01). On serial TP53 NGS using a VAF cutoff of 5%, 40 pts achieved NGS negativity with 6 pts MRD negative (VAF < 0.1%). Of NGS negative pts ( TP53 VAF <5%), best response was CR/PR in 78% (n=31), mCR+HI in 15% (n=6), mCR in 5% (n=2) and HI in 3% (n=1). The median # of cycles in NGS negative and positive pts was 10 and 4, respectively (P<0.0001). All MRD negative pts received at least 5 cycles of therapy (5-15). At data-cutoff by ITT analysis with a median follow up of 27.8 months, median OS was 11.8 months (95% CI 9.4-14.3). Pts undergoing allo-HSCT had a median OS of 16.1 months (95% CI 14-18.1). Impact of response and NGS clearance was evaluated by landmark analysis at 6 months. Pts achieving CR/PR or NGS negativity had improved OS (15.8 vs 10.1 months; P =0.002; Fig 1A). Additionally, pts who became MRD negative had a 2-year OS of 50% vs 23% ( P =0.21). Although allo-HSCT was not predictive of OS in the overall cohort by landmark analysis (14.7 vs 14.4 months; P =0.15; Fig 1B), significant OS improvement was noted in allo-HSCT pts based on CR/PR or NGS negativity (P=0.002; Fig 1C). Notably, pts who achieved CR/PR/NGS negativity and were bridged to allo-HSCT had a median OS that was not reached (95% CI 10.4-NR) vs 9.1 months (95% CI 7.4-NR) in allo-HSCT pts who did not achieve this response ( P =0.01). Conclusions: In this international, combined analysis of P2 APR-246+AZA pts, the combination was well-tolerated with high response rates in m TP53 MDS/AML. Quality of response and NGS negativity strongly predicted OS, particularly in the setting of allo-HSCT, validating NGS clearance as a critical biomarker of allo-HSCT outcomes in m TP53 pts.
