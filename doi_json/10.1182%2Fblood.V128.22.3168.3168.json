    "abstract_text": "Background: Management of anemia is a common therapeutic challenge in patients with MDS. Luspatercept (ACE-536), a fusion protein containing modified activin receptor type IIB, is being developed for treatment of anemia in lower-risk MDS. Luspatercept binds GDF11 and other TGF-\u03b2 superfamily ligands to promote late-stage erythroid differentiation and increase hemoglobin (Hgb) levels (Suragani R, Nat Med, 2014 and Attie K, Am J Hematol, 2014). Aims: This is an ongoing, phase 2, multicenter, open-label, long-term extension study to evaluate the effects of luspatercept in patients (pts) with low-intermediate risk MDS. Endpoints include long-term safety and tolerability, erythroid response (IWG HI-E), RBC transfusion independence (RBC-TI, \u2265 8 weeks), duration of HI-E, pharmacodynamic and iron metabolism biomarkers, and pt-reported QoL. Methods: Inclusion criteria included age \u2265 18 yr, Hgb < 10 g/dL (if < 4U RBC/8 weeks), ESA refractory or EPO > 500 U/L, no prior HMA, and no current lenalidomide or ESA. Luspatercept was administered SC every 3 wks for up to 5 doses in the base study (NCT01749514), including 7 dose escalation cohorts (n=27 total, 0.125 to 1.75 mg/kg) and an expansion cohort (n=31, starting dose 1.0 mg/kg, max 1.75 mg/kg). A 2-year extension study (n=32) is ongoing (NCT02268383). Results: Data (as of 4 Mar 2016) were available for the 32 extension study pts. Of these, 13 pts received < 4U RBC/8 weeks pretreatment (low transfusion burden, LTB) and 19 pts received \u2265 4U RBC/8 weeks (high transfusion burden, HTB). Median age was 72 yr (range 29-90 yr), 59% had prior ESA. Median Hgb for LTB pts was 8.5 g/dL (range 6.4-10.1 g/dL) and median RBC transfusion burden for HTB pts was 6 U/8 weeks (range 4-14 units). 91% pts were RS+ (\u2265 15% RS in bone marrow). IWG HI-E was achieved in 11/13 (85%) LTB pts and 15/19 (79%) HTB pts. 11/22 (50%) pts with at least 2 units transfused in 8 weeks prior to dosing with luspatercept achieved RBC transfusion independence for at least 8 weeks. The range of transfusion independence was 9 to 80+ weeks, with most responders still receiving treatment. IWG HI-E response rates were 83% for RS+ pts, 90% for EPO < 200 U/L, 86% for EPO 200-500 U/L, and 50% for EPO > 500 U/L; 85% for ESA-na\u00efve and 79% for those who had prior ESA treatment. RBC transfusion independence was achieved in 58% for EPO < 200 U/L, 50% for EPO 200-500 U/L, and 33% for EPO > 500 U/L. Luspatercept was well tolerated, with 3 related grade 3 adverse events of myalgia, worsening of general condition, and blast cell count increase. The most common related AEs (\u2265 2 pts in both base and extension studies) were fatigue, bone pain, diarrhea, myalgia, headache, hypertension, and injection site erythema. Conclusions: Long-term treatment with luspatercept was well tolerated and led to erythroid response in 81% of low-intermediate risk MDS pts who enrolled into the extension study. A Phase 3 study of luspatercept in regularly-transfused RS+ patients with lower-risk MDS according to IPSS-R is ongoing (MEDALIST study; NCT02631070).
