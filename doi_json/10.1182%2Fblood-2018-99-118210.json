    "abstract_text": "Background - Partner and localizer of BRCA2 ( PALB2 ) plays a key role in the DNA damage repair (DDR). Genomic alterations of DDR genes rarely occur in AML, while their deregulation at transcriptional level is a known mechanism exploited by leukemic cells in order to sustain the high genetic instability and to continue proliferation. Aim - We aimed to characterize the role of PALB2 in AML by investigating its expression levels and its prognostic value, in order to evaluate its potential as target of therapies based on a synthetic lethality approaches. Methods - Gene expression profiling (GEP, Affymetrix) was performed on bone marrow cells of 7 healthy donors (HD) and 60 AML patients with more than 80% blast cells. K-means clustering of patients according to the expression of PALB2 was performed and differences in survival were assessed d by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results - Our cohort was characterized by a median age at diagnosis of 60 years-old. Twelve out of 43 patients harbored a mutation in FLT3 (27.9%, 17 patients not tested); 8 patients were NPM1 mutated (27.6%, 31 patients not tested); 2 patients were TP53 mutated (3%, all patients tested). According to ELN2017 guidelines, 17 cases were high-risk AML, 38 cases were intermediate, 3 cases had low-risk classification and 2 cases were not classified due to the lack of prognostic markers. We detected variable levels of PALB2 mRNA (range 52.90-244.37) in AML patients and its median expression was higher compared to HD (129.26 vs 67.85, respectively; p =.019). We clustered our patients according to PALB2 expression and we defined 2 groups of patients: cluster H and L with higher and lower expression levels of PALB2 , respectively (cluster centers 158.86 and 105.41, respectively; figure A). Notably, HD revealed PALB2 expression values comparable with the cluster L (range 52.90-99.60). No differences were detected in term of incidence mutations in FLT3 and NPM1 , white blood cell count at diagnosis, age at diagnosis and prevalence of karyotype alterations. Patients were treated with best supportive therapy (n=11/58, therapy data missing for 2 patients), hypomethylating agents (n=2/58) and intensive chemotherapy ( n=45/58). Within patients treated with intensive chemotherapy, we compared complete remission rate after induction and we found no differences between H and L. However, patients with higher expression of PALB2 had worst overall survival than patients in cluster L (median survival group H=397 days; CI 95%=288.9-505.0, L=not reached; p =.045; figure B). Notably, we confirmed worst prognosis in patients in cluster H when considering 33 out of 45 patients with intermediate/low risk karyotype (i.e. normal karyotype, t(8;21) or less than 3 aberrations according to ELN2017; p=.026 ). Conclusion - We identified a subgroup of AML patients with higher expression of PALB2 , which predicted poorer prognosis in patients treated with curative intent and it associated with poorer prognosis in patients with low/intermediate risk. While patients carrying mutations in PALB2 (and BRCA1/2 ) are candidate for PARP inhibitors (PARPi) therapies in breast cancers, few clinical trials with PARPi are available in AML and the frequency of mutations is very low. Our data opens a new scenario in which PALB2 may be a target of therapies in AML based on synthetic lethal approaches targeting the DDR pathway. However, a better understanding of the biological role of PALB2 in AML and its interaction with other alterations is needed. Supported by Fondazione Del Monte Figure.
