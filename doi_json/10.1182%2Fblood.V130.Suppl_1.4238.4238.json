    "abstract_text": "Although several causal genes of familial myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have been discovered, the genetic landscape and the molecular pathogenesis still remain unclear. To explore novel causal genetic alterations and their pathogenetic significance, we performed whole-exome sequencing analysis using four samples from a Japanese familial MDS pedigree, two affected and two unaffected as controls. In total, 16889 non-synonymous germline substitutions were obtained. Among them, twelve candidate single-nucleotide variations ( ANK1, C9orf43, CYP7B1, EFHB, ENTPD7, FAM160B2, HELZ2, HLTF, INPP5J, ITPKB, RYK, TTN ) were elucidated. Of the candidates, we elucidated HLTF , encoding a member of the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermenting (SWI/SNF) family, as a putative associated gene. HLTF works as an E3-ubiquitin ligase and binds with Methyl Methanesulfonate Sensitive 2 (MMS2)/Ubiquitin Conjugating Enzyme E2N (UBC13) complex. This complex is known to promote the Lys-63 linked polyubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), followed by an error-free postreplication DNA repair by arranging template switching (Mailand et al. Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 2013). The obtained germline mutation of HLTF was p.Glu259Lys (E259K), heterozygous mutation. To study the functional role of HLTF, we firstly evaluated the effects of Hltf silencing on hematopoiesis by in vitro colony-formation assay with Hltf-knocked down mouse primary bone marrow cells, and found that these cells have enhanced in vitro colony-formation capacity. In agreement with the acquisition of an immature phenotype, the cells expressing c-kit, a hematopoietic stem/ progenitor cell marker, were increased in Hltf shRNA-expressing colonies after the first round. We then focused on DNA damage in HLTF knockdown HEL cells according to the function of HLTF post-replication DNA repair. We examined the phosphorylation of gamma H2AX foci by immunofluorescent staining and found that the number of foci was increased in HLTF knockdown cells compared with control cells, suggesting that DNA damage was accumulated in HLTF knockdown cells. To investigate the effects of exogenous expression of HLTF E259K mutant protein, we evaluated in vitro apoptosis status with HEL cells transduced with empty vector (EV), HLTF wild type (WT), and HLTF E259K mutant (MT), respectively. In apoptosis assay, annexin V positive cells were significantly increased in MT-overexpressed HEL cells compared with WT-overexpressed HEL cells. In addition, we found that the number of gamma H2AX foci was increased in HLTF MT-overexpressed HEL cells, suggesting that DNA double-strand breaks were accumulated in MT-overexpressed cells. To explore the mechanism of accumulated DNA double-strand breaks by mutant HLTF, we evaluated the binding ability of HLTF mutant protein with PCNA, and MMS2/UBC13, all of which play a critical role in the DNA double-strand break repair process. We found that binding of HLTF MT to MMS2 or UBC13 was significantly attenuated compared with HLTF WT although binding to PCNA remained unchanged, suggesting HLTF MT cannot efficiently form a complex that induces polyubiquitination of PCNA. In line with this, PCNA polyubiquitination was impaired in HLTF MT-overexpressed cells compared with HLTF WT-overexpressed cells. Finally, we searched somatic HLTF mutation in sporadic MDS bone marrow samples. Whole HLTF coding regions of 40 samples were sequenced. As a result, a novel HLTF missense heterozygous mutation (p.Thr50Ala, T50A) was identified in one sample (1/40 = 2.5%). These data suggested the possibility that HLTF mutation might contribute to the pathogenesis not only in familial MDS but also in sporadic MDS. In conclusion, our results indicated that HLTF E259K germ line mutation accumulates DNA damage through impaired PCNA polyubiquitination. The aberrant function of HLTF mutant might play a role in the pathogenesis of familial MDS.
