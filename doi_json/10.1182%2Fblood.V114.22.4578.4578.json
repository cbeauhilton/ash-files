    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4578 Introduction Islet transplantation is an effective way of reversing type 1 diabetes. However, islet transplantation has been hampered by problems, such as immune rejection, and the scarcity of donor islets. Human Umbilical Cord Wharton's Jelly-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (huMSCs), which can be differentiated into insulin-producing cells could provide a source of cells for transplant. Methods Vitro Research We isolated and cultured huMSCs, and induced huMSCs differentiated into insulin-producing cells in the condition of islet cells grows. The morphology of huMSCs after induction were monitored by under inversion phase contrast microscope?GImmunocytochemical methods were used to detect the insulin and glucagon protein, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was used to detect Human insulin gene and PDX-1 gene. Dithizon-stained was used to detect zinc hydronium and radio-immunity was used to detect insulin level of culture supernatant. Vivo Research huMSCs were transplanted into the body of diabetic rats through vena caudalis, and then we observed the change of blood glucose?Abody weight ?Aserum insulin levels and survival ratio in STZ-induced diabetic rats. We detected human insulin by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. HE stain was used to detect the morphological changes of rat's pancreatic island. Results Vitro Research The morphology of huMSCs under medicine induction gradually changed from fibroblast to round and some of then had the tend of forming clusters.?GThe result of immunocytochemical showed that the expression of human insulin and glucagon was positive after treatment with medicine?GhuMSCs induced by medicine can express insulin and PDX-1 gene by RT-PCR?GDithizon stain show that the cytoplasm of huMSCs after induction were stained in Brownish red color?Gthe results of radio-immunity manifested that the insulin quantity secreted by medicine induction were significant differences compared with control group(t??6.183,P<0.05). Vivo Research When transplanted into Streptozotocin(STZ)-treated diabetics rats, huMSCs can decreased blood glucose, increased body weight and survival ratio in diabetic rats?GAfter being transplanted for one month, we discovered that it can be planted into rat's pancreas and liver by Hoechst33258?Gimmunohistochemistry and RT-PCR show that the pancreas of rat can express human insulin?Gthe morphology of rats' pancreatic island was repaired obviously if compared with diabetic rats before the transplantation through HE-stain . Conclusion huMSCs can be differentiated into insulin-producing cells in vitro or in vivo. Therefore, huMSCs have the potential to become an excellent candidate in \u03b2 cell replacement therapy of diabetes. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
