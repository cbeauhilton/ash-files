    "abstract_text": "In a previous study, we showed that heightened AKT activity sensitized multiple myeloma (MM) cells to the in vivo anti-tumor effects of CCI-779. To test the mechanism of AKT\u2019s regulatory role, we studied isogenic U266 MM cell lines transfected with an activated AKT allele or empty vector. The AKT-transfected cells were markedly more sensitive to cytostasis induced in vitro by rapamycin or in vivo by CCI-779. In contrast, cells with quiescent AKT were completely resistant. The ability of rapamycin and CCI-779 to inhibit D-cyclin expression was also significantly greater in AKT-transfected MM cells and this was, in part, due to a greater ability to curtail cap-independent translation and internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity of D-cyclin transcripts. As ERK/p38 activity can facilitate IRES-mediated translation of some transcripts, we investigated ERK/p38 as regulators of rapamycin sensitivity. AKT-transfected cells demonstrated significantly decreased ERK and p38 activity, suggesting their involvement. However, only an ERK inhibitor prevented D-cyclin IRES activity in resistant \u201clow AKT\u201d myeloma cells while a p38 inhibitor had no effect. Furthermore, the combination of rapamycin and the ERK inhibitor successfully sensitized myeloma cells to rapamycin in terms of down regulated D-cyclin protein expression and G1 arrest. These data support a scenario where ERK facilitates D-cyclin IRES function and heightened AKT activity down regulates this ERK-dependent phenomenon. Thus ERK and AKT activity are potential predictors of responsiveness to mTOR inhibitors.",
