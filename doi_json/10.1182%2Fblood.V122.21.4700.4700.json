    "abstract_text": "Introduction The vascular alterations play an important role in the SCA chronic inflammatory state with the participation of different cell types, including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Aim Here, we evaluated the mRNA expression of TLRs in DCs cells pre and post LPS stimulus and also measured IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 cytokines in plasma and supernatant of DCs pre and post LPS challenge, in order to indentify a possible role of this cell and receptor in the inflammatory state described in sickle cell anemia. Methods In vitro generation of immature DCs (imDC) monocyte-derived was obtained of monocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of seven hospitalized HbSS patients. Relative mRNA abundance of each transcript was investigated by quantitative real time PCR and cytokines levels were measured by ELISA. Results We found that different HbSS patients showed specific DCs TLR expression and a differential levels of IL-1\u03b2 among HbSS patients with and without pneumonia history (p=0.0253) and with hemoglobin concentration (p=0.0288) ( Fig. 1 ). There was difference of TLR4 mRNA expression between HbSS patients groups without and with leg ulcers history (0.320+0.302 and 1.60+0.014) respectively (p=0.0016); with platelets count between HbSS patients groups with TLR2 expression < 50 th (569.7+3.512) and > 50 th (304.5+111.7) (p=0.0102) and reticulocytes count between HbSS patients groups with TLR2 expression < 50 th (15.97+2.450) and > 50 th (2.025+2.417) (p=0.0007) and of TNF-alpha concentration in DCs supernatant culture among HbSS patients with TLR5 expression < 50 th (30.57+11.92) and > 50 th (7.053+6.918) (p=0.0496) and of IL-10 concentration in DCs supernatant culture among HbSS patients with TLR5 expression < 50 th (3.525+0.921) and > 50 th (5.790+1.226) (p=0.0374) ( Fig.2 ). It was also found statistic difference of IL-1 beta concentration in DCs supernatant culture post LPS stimulus between HbSS patients without and with pneumonia history (P=0.0253); analysis of TLR4 mRNA expression between HbSS patients without and with leg ulcer history (P=0.0016); analysis of hemoglobin concentration between HbSS patients with different plasma IL-1 beta concentration (P=0.0288) Conclusion Ours results show that these molecules and cell type possibly have an important role in maintain the inflammatory state described in this disease.
