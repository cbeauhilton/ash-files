    "abstract_text": "Background: The prognostic role of bio-makers LMP1 and miR-155 in lymphoma remains controversial. This study is mainly conducted to assess the effect of LMP1 and miR-155 on the survival of lymphoma patients and additionally evaluate the clinic feathers to see their influence on outcomes compared with the previous studies. Methods: FFPE samples during May 2010 to April 2015 are collected from our center. Microarray analysis, IHC and realtime-qPCR are used to evaluate the expression of LMP1 and miR-155. The association between biomarkers or clinic feathers with patients` outcomes is assessed by log-rank statistical test, Cox proportional hazard model and Kaplan-Meier method. SPSS 19.0 is performed in this calculation. Results: Eighty-two patients are finally included in this study, which all have a high expression of miR-155. Late stage, high expression of LMP1 and miR-155 are related to poor PFS (stage: HR, 0.561; 95% CI, 0.210-1.496; p = 0.048; LMP1: HR, 0.192; 95% CI, 0.078-0.471; p <0.001; miR-155: HR, 0.384; 95% CI, 0.177-0.833; p = 0.015), while old age, high IPI score and high expression of miR-155 and LMP1 are related to poor OS (age: HR, 0.495; 95% CI, 0.255-0.960; p = 0.038; IPI: HR, 3.767; 95% CI, 1.315-10.786; p = 0.013; LMP1: HR, 0.138; 95% CI, 0.044-0.437; p = 0.001; miR-155: HR, 0.319; 95% CI, 0.107-0.953; p = 0.041). Conclusions: LMP1 and miR-155 are new and reliable biomarkers for prognostic prediction of lymphoma. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
