One of the most common cytogenetic abnormalities in MDS is isolated trisomy 8 (\u223c20%). However, the impact of this abnormality on prognosis in MDS is unclear. In the following, we report on all MDS cases with isolated trisomy 8 seen at our institution and describe the natural history of this abnormality. Methods: After approval from the Institutional Review Board, the cytogenetics laboratory database at Mayo Clinic was searched for all cases of isolated trisomy 8. All patients had given written informed consent to enable use of their medical record for research. The medical records were reviewed and relevant demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were abstracted. Survival was determined from diagnosis until death or last contact with the patient and measured using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analysis for survival were performed using the Cox proportional hazard method. Results: Out of a total of 23, 375 unique patient specimens evaluated over a twenty year period (January 1988 \u2013 December 2008), we identified a cohort of 106 patients (0.45%) with trisomy 8 as the sole cytogenetic abnormality (males with \u2013Y were included). Of these patients, 89 had a classical MDS and 66 patients were males. The median age at diagnosis of MDS was 70.0 years (range: 31 \u2013 91) for the whole cohort (females: 67 yr, males: 71.5 yr, p=0.22). All patients presented with at least one cytopenia, median Hb: 9.8g/dl (3.9 \u2013 15.4); WBC: 4.6\u00d710 3 /ml (1.0 \u2013 102.6); PLT: 119\u00d710 3 /ml (3.0 \u2013 740), bone marrow blasts: 5% (0 \u2013 22.5), LDH: 221 (62 \u2013 1342). Considering trisomy 8 as an intermediate risk abnormality (score = 0.5), the median IPSS for the cohort was 1.0 (0.5 \u2013 2.5) (Intermediate-1). The distribution of cases included: MDS with <5% blasts (55%), RAEB-1 (16%), RAEB-2 (18%), and CMML (11%). 85% of patients required transfusion sometime after diagnosis and 40% were treated with some form of chemotherapy. Transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurred in 25 patients (28.1%) and of these, 22 have died. The median time from diagnosis to transformation to AML was 33 months. The median overall survival from diagnosis was 36 months, similar to what is expected for Int-1 patients (Blood 89:2079, 1997). On univariate analysis, age at diagnosis (p=0.05), LDH (p=0.017) and time to transformation (p<0.0001) were prognostic. On multivariate analysis, LDH (p=0.007) and time to transformation (p=0.009) remained independent prognostic factors. Conclusions: Isolated trisomy 8 in MDS is associated with intermediate risk disease. The risk of transformation to acute leukemia is 28% and the median survival from diagnosis of MDS is approximately 3 years. A significant fraction of patients die due to causes unrelated to their hematopoietic disorder. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
