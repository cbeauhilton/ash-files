    "abstract_text": "Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors represent a new mechanistic class of anti-cancer therapeutics that inhibit HDAC enzymes and have been shown to have anti-proliferative effects in cancer cells (including drug resistance subtypes), induce apoptosis, inhibit angiogenesis, and sensitize cancer cells when combined with other available anti-cancer therapies. PXD101 is a novel investigational small molecule drug that selectively inhibits HDAC enzymes. In recent preclinical studies, PXD101 has been shown to have the potential to treat a wide range of solid and hematological malignancies either as a monotherapy or in combination with other active agents. In this study, we evaluated the activity of PXD101 on multiple myeloma samples when used as monotherapy or in combination with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. In vitro experiments indicated that PXD101 pretreatment (20 mM; 3h) sensitized RPMI-8226 human multiple myeloma cells to subsequent bortezomib exposure (5 nM; 72h). To examine PXD101 and bortezomib in vivo , two mouse models of human multiple myeloma were utilized (LAG\u03bb-1 and LAG\u03ba-1B). LAG\u03bb-1 was generated from a patient resistant to melphalan therapy and LAG\u03ba-1B from a patient who progressed on bortezomib treatment (Campbell et al , International Journal of Oncology 2006). SCID mice were implanted with LAG\u03bb-1 or LAG\u03ba-1B tumor fragments into the left superficial gluteal muscle. Tumors were allowed to grow for 14 days at which time human IgG levels were detectable in the mouse serum, and mice were randomly assigned into treatment groups. Groups consisted of Vehicle only, PXD101 alone (40 mg/kg), bortezomib alone (0.5 mg/kg), or PXD101 (40 mg/kg) + bortezomib (0.5 mg/kg). In one cohort, PXD101 and bortezomib were administered twice weekly (M, Th) and in another cohort PXD101 was administered 5 days a week (M-F) and bortezomib twice weekly (M, Th). When administered, PXD101 was given i.p twice daily and bortezomib once daily intravenously. The results of these animal experiments will provide preclinical information on the activity of PXD101 monotherapy and PXD101/bortezomib combination therapy on drug-resistant myeloma samples, and may help to define the optimal schedule for potential clinical evaluation of this drug combination."
