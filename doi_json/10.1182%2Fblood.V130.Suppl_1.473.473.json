    "abstract_text": "Mutations affecting RNA splicing factors are commonly found in leukemias and mutations in SF3B1 , SRSF2 , and U2AF1 impart specific changes to global splicing. We analyzed RNA-seq data from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to evaluate for spliceosomal alterations characteristic of mutant SRSF2 , SF3B1 , and U2AF1 . Although only 1 patient with an SRSF2 mutation was reported in the TCGA AML publication, we identified 19 additional patients to have the characteristic splicing changes of mutant SRSF2 . Mutational analysis of the RNA-seq data identified the SRSF2 proline 95 hotspot mutation in each of these 19 patients (19/178, 11%), making SRSF2 amongst the most commonly mutated genes in the AML TCGA dataset. Interestingly, 47% of SRSF2 mutant patients also had a co-existing IDH2 mutation (and conversely, 50% of IDH2 mutant patients had a co-existing SRSF2 mutation). These data are similar to recent observation that SRSF2 mutations were the most common accompanying mutation in IDH2 mutant myeloid leukemia patients treated on the phase I clinical trial of AG-221. We next sought to understand the functional contribution of SRSF2 mutations to co-existing IDH2 mutations. Overexpression of IDH2 R140Q and IDH2 R172K in Vav -cre Srsf2 P95H or Vav- cre Srsf2 wildtype(WT) backgrounds revealed a clear collaborative effect of mutant IDH2 and mutant Srsf2 ( Figure A-B ). As early as 4 weeks post-transplant, the peripheral blood of Srsf2 mutant mice transplanted with IDH2 R140Q or IDH2 R172K forms had a substantially greater percentage of GFP+ cells than seen in an Srsf2 WT background. Moreover, these mice exhibited significant myeloid skewing, macrocytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia of greater magnitude than seen with mutant IDH2 expressed in the SRSF2 WT background. IDH2 / Srsf2 double-mutant mice developed a lethal, mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm that was serially transplantable ( Figure B ). Effects from overexpression of mutant IDH2 were recapitulated in mice expressing Idh2 R140Q and Srsf2 P95H from endogenous loci( Mx1 -cre Idh2 R140Q/+ Srsf2 P95H/+ double knock-in mice) ( Figure C ), providing the first model where spliceosomal gene mutations promote leukemogenesis in vivo . Given prior data identifying inhibition of TET2 as a mediator of IDH2 -mutant leukemogenesis, we evaluated if loss of TET2 might promote transformation of SRSF2 mutant cells. However, deletion of TET2 in an SRSF2 mutant background ( Mx1 -cre Tet2 fl/fl Srsf2 P95H/+ ) was insufficient to promote transformation ( Figure D ). We next analyzed RNA-seq data from the TCGA, Leucegene, and our own unpublished AML cohort using a novel analysis method to detect unannotated as well as complex splicing events that might explain the basis for the collaboration of mutant IDH2 and SRSF2 . This revealed that IDH2/SRSF2 double-mutant AML had increased aberrant splicing events compared to SRSF2 single-mutant AML and also that IDH2 -mutations are associated with a small but reproducible change in RNA splicing ( Figure E ). The vast majority of splicing changes affected by SRSF2 and/or IDH2 mutations were a change in cassette exon splicing with SRSF2 mutations promoting inclusion of C-rich containing mRNA sequences, regardless of the presence of concomitant IDH2 mutations ( Figure F ). One of the most robust mis-splicing events in IDH2/SRSF2 mutant AML was an intron retention event in INTS3 resulting in its reduced mRNA and protein expression ( Figure G-H ). INTS3 encodes a component of the integrator complex that participates in small nuclear RNA (snRNA) processing. Consistent with this, IDH2 / SRSF2 double-mutant cells exhibited alterations in processing of U2 and U4 snRNAs similar to that seen with direct INTS3 downregulation. Biologically, attenuation of INTS3 expression caused a blockade of myeloid differentiation in HL-60 cells upon ATRA treatment, an effect which was further enhanced in an IDH2 mutant background. These data uncover an important role for spliceosomal gene mutations in the pathogenesis of IDH2 mutant leukemogenesis and identify perturbations in the integrator complex as a novel mediator driving the transformation of IDH2 and SRSF2 mutant cells. The frequent coexistence of IDH2 and SRSF2 mutations underscores the enormous therapeutic potential for modulation of splicing in the ~50% of IDH2 -mutant leukemia patients who also harbor a spliceosomal gene mutation.
