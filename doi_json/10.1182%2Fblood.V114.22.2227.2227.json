    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2227 Poster Board II-204 Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) contributes to morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and more effective prevention and treatment strategies are needed. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A-reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to possess immunomodulatory properties in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether donor or recipient statin use may affect the risk of GVHD, we retrospectively analyzed outcomes among 567 patients with hematologic malignancies who had hematopoietic cell transplantation from HLA-matched related donors at a single institution between 2001 and 2007. Compared to allografts where neither the donor nor recipient was treated with a statin at the time of transplant (n=464), statin use by the donor and not the recipient (n=75) was associated with a profoundly decreased risk of grade 3-4 acute GVHD (multivariate hazard ratio [HR], 0.28; 95= confidence interval [CI], 0.1-0.9; p=0.03) ( Table ). Statin use by both donor and recipient (n=12) was suggestively associated with a decreased risk of grade 3-4 acute GVHD (HR, 0.00; 95= CI, undefined; p=0.06), while statin use by the recipient and not the donor (n=16) did not confer GVHD-protection. Risks of chronic GVHD, recurrent malignancy, non-relapse mortality and overall mortality were not significantly affected by donor or recipient statin exposure. Statin-associated GVHD-protection was restricted to recipients with cyclosporine-based postgrafting immunosuppression (n=417; 74=) and was not observed among those given tacrolimus (significance of effect modification: cyclosporine vs. tacrolimus, p=0.009). These results suggest that donor statin treatment may be a promising strategy for preventing severe acute GVHD without compromising immunologic control of the underlying malignancy.
