    "abstract_text": "Heparin or heparin-like compounds present in human plasma in minute amounts. It has been reported that a very few patients with such diseases as plasma cell neoplasms, acute monoblastic leukemia and acquired immune deficincy syndrome have an increased plasma heparin-like anticoagulant activity. Recently, we found a 10-year-old girl who was physically and developmentally normal, but had recurrent episodes of prolonged bleeding and hematoma starting in her early childhood, which could be stopped by transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate. The coagulation tests of her plasma were regularly repeated since she was 2 years old, and always revealed a markedly prolonged APTT (61.8\u2013104 seconds, normal 28\u201340 seconds) and TT (36\u201350.1 seconds, normal 14\u201321 seconds), and a slightly prolonged PT (15.9\u201325 seconds, normal 11\u201314.5 seconds). Fibrinogen, prothrombin and other coagulation factors as well as anticoagulant and fibrinolytic systems were all normal. The results of immunologic measurements were either negative or within normal ranges. Treatment of the patient\u2019s plasma in vitro with either protamine or heparinase could completely normalize the coagulation abnormalities, but not with normal plasma. The anticoagulant activity of her plasma corresponded to 0.2 heparin U/mL when measured by a TT assay using normal plasma as substrate and standardized with porcine heparin. Her plasma heparin concentration was 0.22 heparin U/mL when measured using a colometric assay. In ex vivo study, the abnormal coagulation tests could effectively be corrected when the patient was intravenously administed with protamine. Considering these characteristic laboratory features of the patient, we suppose it would probably represent a novel congenital bleeding disorder related to high plasma heparin-like anticoagulant activity which, to our knowledge, had not been described before.",
