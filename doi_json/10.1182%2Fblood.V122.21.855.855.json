    "abstract_text": "Acute and chronic leukemias, including CD34+ CML stem cells, overexpress the Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1) protein, making WT1 an attractive therapeutic target. ESKM is a fully human IgG1 antibody that targets a 9 amino acid sequence (RMF) of the protein WT1 in the context of HLA-A0201, allowing it to target an undruggable, widely expressed, intracellular oncogene product. BV173 is an HLA-A0201+, human Ph+ ALL cell line that expresses WT1, and tagged by our lab with luciferase. We engineered a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistant BV173-R cell line by transducing BV173 with the resistant T315I Bcr-Abl plasmid. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) was evaluated in vitro by chromium release assay, utilizing human PBMC effectors. Tumor growth in vivo was assessed in NOD/SCID gamma (NSG) mice with bioluminescence imaging (BLI). RT-PCR was used to evaluate minimal residual disease in mice with negative BLI signal at the end of therapy. Imatinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib were used at up to maximally tolerated doses, given IP once daily. ESKM was administered at 100 \u00b5g twice weekly IP. ESKM mediated ADCC against both BV173 and BV173-R cell lines in vitro . In a BV173 engrafted human leukemia xenograft model, ESKM was more potent than imatinib, with median tumor growth reduction of 78% vs 52%. Combination of imatinib and ESKM therapy resulted in a 94% reduction in leukemic growth. High dose dasatinib (40 mg/kg daily) was more potent than ESKM, but discontinuation of therapy due to dasatinib toxicity resulted in relapse. Combination with ESKM therapy with dasatinib resulted in cure in 75% of mice, confirmed by bone marrow RT-PCR three weeks after termination of therapy. For mice cytoreduced with dasatinib followed by consolidation therapy with ESKM, delayed relapse was observed, but no cures. ESKM was highly superior to imatinib and dasatinib against the T315I BV173-R leukemia in vivo. Cures were not achieved with combination therapy of ESKM and either first or second generation TKIs against resistant T315I leukemia. Ponatinib at 10 mg/kg had higher efficacy than ESKM alone against BV173-R, but mice treated with combination of ESKM and ponatinib had superior tumor reduction. CONCLUSION : ESKM is an effective therapeutic antibody for sensitive and T315I Ph+ ALL. Resistant T315I Ph+ leukemic growth is inhibited more effectively by ESKM therapy compared to imatinib and dasatinib, and combination therapy with ESKM is superior to ponatinib.
