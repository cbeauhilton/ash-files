    "abstract_text": "Background : The youngest patients referred for CAR T cell therapy are those with relapsed or refractory (R/R) KMT2A-rearranged infant B-ALL. Infants with relapsed ALL following Interfant-99 therapy have a dismal reported 3-yr OS of 20.9%, indicating the need for novel therapies. Smaller patient size, heavily pre-treated disease and high leukemia burden are often characteristics of this subgroup of patients that pose unique challenges to apheresis and manufacture of a T cell product. Additionally, reports of KMT2A-rearranged leukemia undergoing lineage switch following CD19-targeting pressure raises concern for an increased risk of myeloid leukemia relapses after B-lineage targeted CAR T cell therapy in this population. Here we report our experience using CAR T cell immunotherapy for patients with R/R infant ALL enrolled on clinical trials PLAT-02 (NCT02028455) and PLAT-05 (NCT03330691). Methods: PLAT-02 is a phase 1/2 trial of CD19-specific (FMC63scFv:IgG4hinge:CD28tm:4-1BB:\u03b6) CAR T cells. PLAT-05 is a phase 1 trial of CD19xCD22 dual specific CAR T cells, transduced with two separate lentiviral vectors to direct the co-expression of the CD19-specific CAR above and a CD22-specific CAR (m971scFv:IgG4hinge-CH2(L235D)-CH3-CD28tm:4-1BB:\u03b6). Eligible subjects on both studies have R/R B-ALL, an absolute lymphocyte count \u2265100 cells/\u00b5L, and were at least 1 year of age. In addition, subjects on PLAT-02 were \u2265 10kg, and \u2265 8kg on PLAT-05. For cell manufacture, apheresis products were immuno-magnetically selected for CD4 and CD8 cells. Selected T cells were activated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads, transduced, and grown in culture with homeostatic cytokines to numbers suitable for clinical use. Infant ALL subjects received a range of 5x10 5 to 10x10 6 CAR+ T cells/kg following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Disease response assessments were required at Day 21 and Day 63 following CAR T cell infusion. Adverse events were graded according to CTCAEv4, except CRS which was graded according to 2014 Lee criteria. Results : Eighteen subjects with R/R infant ALL have enrolled on PLAT-02 (n=14) or PLAT-05 (n=4), with a median age of 22.5 months at enrollment (range: 14.5 - 40.1 months). Of these, 2 (11.1%) had primary refractory disease, 8 (44.4%) were in 1 st relapse, 7 (38.9%) were in 2 nd relapse and 1 (5.6%) was in 3 rd or greater relapse. Ten subjects (55.6%) had an M2 marrow or greater at enrollment prior to apheresis, and 9/18 had a history of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). The mean ALC was 1309 cells/\u00b5L (range 253-6944). Successful CAR T cell products were manufactured in 17/18 subjects, including in 9/9 subjects with no prior history of HCT. Of these, 16/17 subjects with available products were infused, with a median follow up of 26.9 months. One subject died of disease complications prior to CAR T cell infusion. Of the 16 treated subjects, 1 is pending disease and toxicity assessments. The maximum grade of CRS was 3 and occurred in two of 15 evaluable subjects (13%) and neurotoxicity was limited to a maximum grade of 2. Fourteen of 15 (93.3%) achieved an MRD negative complete remission (MRD-CR) by Day 21. Of the 14 subjects with an MRD-CR, 6 went on to HCT with 1 subsequent CD19 negative relapse. Of the 8 subjects who did not proceed to HCT, 1 developed lineage switch at one month following CAR T cells, and 1 died of infectious complications with aplasia. A \"wait and watch\" approach was taken for the remaining 6 subjects, and 2 developed CD19+ relapse. The incidence of lineage switch among the infant ALL group was 1/15 (6.7%). The estimated 1-year LFS was 66.7% and 1-year OS was 71.4%. Conclusion: This is the largest reported cohort to date of R/R infant B-ALL subjects treated with CAR T cell therapy. We report successful manufacture and administration of a CAR T cell product in the significant majority of infant subjects. Toxicity and MRD-CR rates are comparable to that of non-infant ALL subjects. In our experience, subjects with R/R infant ALL are not at increased risk for lineage switch relapse compared with the entire study populations following B-antigen targeting CAR T cell immunotherapy. Numbers in this report are too small to make definitive conclusions about the value of consolidative HCT. However, the LFS of this cohort is remarkably higher when compared with historical controls. Future work is focused on overcoming feasibility issues for the smallest of subjects, to enable a larger number of these cases to access CAR T cell therapy.
