    "abstract_text": "Objective: To study effect hemopoiesis reconstituted of auto-mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) or allo-mesenchymal stromal cells transplantion. Methods: MSCs were obtained from transplantion patient or embryo by culturing in Zhongshan university stem cell center. 2 patient(SLE, lymphoma) were transplant auto-MSCs before transplantion auto- haemopoietic stem cell(HSC), MSCs were 2.43\u00d710 7 /kg,2.76\u00d710 7 /kg, CD34+ cells were 2.13\u00d710 4 /kg,2.54\u00d710 4 /kg. 2 patient(CML, lymphoma) were transplant allo-MSCs(from embryo) after transplantion (+60 and +180), patient with CML was allo-HSCT, patient with lymphoma was auto-HSCT. MSCs were 2.23\u00d710 5 /kg. Rasults: 2 patients with combination transplantation auto-MSCs and auto-HSC were not adverse effect, neutrophil\u22650.5 \u00d710 9 / L were +1 day and +10 day, platelet \u226520 \u00d710 9 / L were +1day and +8 day, granulocyte deficiency time were 0day and 7days. Two patients were complete remission(273 day and 124 day). Another two patient hemopoiesis delay (after transplantation +60 and +180) were transplanted allo-MSCs(from embryo), one patient with CML rised blood cell after transplantion, but 10 days later the patient relapsed, bone marrow showed acute transformation of chronic myelocytic leukemia. The patient died due to giving up trentment. The patient with lymphoma were transplanted allo-MSCs (from embryo), blood cells transient rised, but blood cells decreased after one week. Now the patient were complete remission (+300 day), but blood cells were lower. The two MSCs (from embryo) transplantation were failure. Conclusion: It is important that how to chose the MScs transplantation time. Combination transplantation auto-MSCs and auto-HSC can promote hemopoiesis re-establish, especially to fit old age patient. If patient with hemopoiesis delay after transplantation were trantplanted allo-MSCs maybe further research. [ key word] MSCs, transplantation, haemopoietic stem cell, hemopoiesis re-establish",
