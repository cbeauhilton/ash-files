    "abstract_text": "From 1993\u20132001 we treated 186 patients (pts) with relapsed or primary refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) on IRB-approved clinical trials with ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide (ICE)-based second-line chemotherapy (SLT). Pts with chemosensitive disease received high dose chemoradiotherapy (HDT) and ASCT. In the context of these studies we reported the following: Pts achieving a complete response to ICE, pre-HDT/ASCT, have an improved overall survival (OS) (Journal of Clinical Oncology 1999, 12: 3776\u201385), pts with chemosensitive primary refractory disease have the same OS as relapsed pts (Blood 2000, 96: 2399\u20132404); and the second-line age-adjusted IPI (SAAIPI) predicts OS (Blood 2003, 102: 1989\u201396). In an attempt to further delineate prognostic factors in this setting tissue microarrays (TMA) were constructed as previously described by our group (Hum Pathol 2002: 968\u201374). All patients had a repeat biopsy prior to initiating SLT confirming active DLBCL; this sample was used for the TMA. Adequate tissue was available on 88 of these pts. TMA sections were stained for the following immunohistochemical markers and analyzed: MIB-1 (Ki-67), MUC1, MDR, p53, bcl-2, CD10, bcl-6, and MUM1. MIB-1 was scored in quartiles and for statistical purposes grouped as 1\u20132+ (50% tumor cells positive). For all other markers, a positive score was based on >20% of tumor cells staining positive. The \"molecular phenotype\"(MP), germinal center (GC) vs non-GC has an impact on progression-free survival in untreated DLBCL; we also evaluated whether the MP of the pre-ICE biopsy specimen could predict survival in pts with relapsed or primary refractory DLBCL undergoing SLT/HDT/ASCT. A GC phenotype is defined as either CD10 positive or bcl-6 positive and MUM 1 negative ( Hans et al Blood  2004 ; 103 : 275 \u2013282 ). At a median follow-up of 6.5 years the the actuarial OS is 39.7% and 49% for patients receiving HDT/ASCT. In this subset of 88 pts, we confirmed that the SAAIPI predicted outcome: good risk pts having an OS of 52% and poor risk 26%, p<0.001 and pts with primary refractory disease that received HDT/ASCT had the same OS as those with relapsed disease. None of the TMA markers impacted outcome; nor was there a difference in outcome based upon GC vs. non-GC TMA MP. The OS of GC pts vs. non-GC pts as analyzed by intent to treat is 38.3% and 42.9% respectively, p=0.7; and for the pts who received HDT/ASCT (53.4% vs. 54.5%, p=.97) Conclusion: A non-GC \"molecular phenotype\" does not predict for a poor outcome in pts with relapsed or primary refractory DLBCL treated with ICE-based SLT followed by HDT/ASCT.
