    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2370 TIF1gamma (or TRIM33) is an ubiquitous nuclear protein that belongs to the transcriptional intermediary factor 1 family. Human and mouse TIF1gamma are closely related to zebrafish moonshine ( mon ), a gene whose mutations disrupt embryonic and adult hematopoiesis with severe red blood cell aplasia. Targeted deletion of Tif1gamma is embryonic lethal in mice. In zebrafish and human CD34+ cells, TIF1gamma functionally links positive elongation factors such as p-TEFb and FACT to blood specific transcription complexes ( e.g. the SCL/TAL1 complex) to regulate elongation of genes by antagonizing Pol II pausing. TIF1gamma also affects the human hematopoietic progenitor cell response to the cytokines of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily through various mechanisms. Recently, we showed that the loss of Tif1gamma in mouse hematopoietic stem cells (cFES -Cre- Tif1gamma ) favors the expansion of the granulo-monocytic progenitor compartment. The gene deletion induces the age-dependent appearance of a cell-autonomous myeloproliferative disorder with myelodysplastic features, monocytosis, and hepatosplenomegaly that recapitulates essential features of human chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Interestingly, TIF1gamma is almost undetectable in leukemic cells of 35% of patients with CMML. This down-regulation is related to the hyper-methylation of CpG sequences in the gene promoter. Our results demonstrated that TIF1gamma is an epigenetically regulated tumor suppressor gene in hematopoietic cells. In addition, an altered production of peritoneal macrophages was observed in our mouse model. These macrophages did not adhere to the plastic and were morphologically abnormal in vitro . In bone marrow and in Lin- progenitor cells, Tif1gamma deletion leads to a significant decrease of cfms ( Csf-1r ) expression, required for the differentiation, proliferation, and survival of monocytic phagocytes. We also identified in CMML patients the association between low levels of TIF1gamma and cFMS (Aucagne et al., J. Clin. Invest. , 121, 2361\u20132370, 2011). To gain insight into the possible mechanism accounting for diminished accumulation of macrophages, we examined the expression of c-Fms. We show that level of its expression is reduced significantly in blood monocytes isolated from Tif1gamma -deleted mice. When Tif1gamma -deleted sorted myeloid cells were induced to differentiate into macrophages in presence of CSF-1, a delayed production of few abnormal large macrophages was observed. Apoptosis was associated with this alteration of differentiation. This phenomenon was also characterized in young mice not developing the disease yet. The morphological abnormalities were correlated with very important alterations of specific macrophage differentiation markers. Expression of specific transcription factors involved in macrophage differentiation was deeply deregulated. Moreover, macrophage function such as migration, cytokine or chemokine secretion in response to LPS was altered. Likewise, in vitro differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells was also abnormal. Altogether, our results suggest that monocyte plasticity is at least partially orchestrated by Tif1gamma.
