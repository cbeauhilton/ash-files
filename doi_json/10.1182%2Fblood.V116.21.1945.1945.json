    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1945 Background Prognosis of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) has significantly improved by the introduction of autologous (auto) stem cell transplantation (SCT). The \u201cnovel drugs\u201d which have shown activity in relapsed MM are increasingly used in first-line therapy aiming at maximized response prior to SCT. Whether allogeneic (allo) SCT adds to further disease control remains a matter of debate. Our group has shown the RAD regimen (lenalidomide, adriamycin and dexamethasone) to be highly effective and relatively well tolerated in relapsed and refractory MM. Therefore, we decided to explore RAD in the up-front management. Patients and Methods The current phase-II trial (DSMM XII) was designed to include patients (pts) up to the age of 65 years with newly diagnosed MM requiring treatment. We chose four cycles of RAD (lenalidomide 25 mg d-21; infusional adriamycin 9 mg/m 2 per day d1-4; dexamethasone 40 mg d1-4 and 17\u201320; pegfilgrastim 6 mg d 6) every 4 weeks for induction followed by chemomobilization of peripheral blood stem cells. Low molecular weight heparin is mandatory during RAD treatment for thromboprophylaxis. All pts are to undergo one cycle of melphalan 200 mg/m 2 followed by auto SCT. A subsequent allo SCT after reduced intensity conditioning (treosulfan/fludarabin) is scheduled for pts featuring at least one previously identified (cytogenetic or serologic) risk factor. Those with very favourable risk are to proceed to a second auto SCT. All patients will receive 12 months of lenalidomide maintenance (10 mg per day) on a continuous basis. Here, we present results of a planned safety analysis. Results 75 pts with a median age of 57 (range, 35\u201366) years have been enrolled by 11 German centers between 9/2009 and 7/2010. Currently, 51 pts are evaluable for toxicity during RAD induction: In all, 25 severe adverse events (SAEs) were reported for 16 subjects (31%). 68% of SAEs were assessed to be drug-related. Most frequent events were venous thrombosis (VTE; n=4), pyrexia (n=3) and syncope (n=2). Neutropenia, extravasation, pleural effusion, and allergic dermatitis accounted for one SAE each. 17 patients, 10 of whom (59%) had ISS stage II/III disease, are evaluable for post-induction response. Ten subjects (59%) achieved VGPR or better: 6 pts had VGPR and 2 patients each CR and stringent CR as assessed by the investigator. Conclusions Our preliminary results suggest RAD to be a well tolerated and effective novel induction protocol in up-front treatment of MM. Notably, incidence of severe hematotoxicity observed so far is significantly lower than was in our previous study in relapsed/refractory pts. Incidence of VTE was acceptable while no neurotoxicity occurred. Updated results will be presented. Disclosures: Knop: Celgene Germany: Consultancy, Honoraria.
