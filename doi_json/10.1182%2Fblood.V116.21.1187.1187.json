Micro-flow imaging (MFI) is a novel method of imaging biologic fluids and provides a means of quantifying cell aggregation. Method: Umbilical cord blood (UCB) was collected following informed consent and cryopreserved in 5% DMSO and 37% (w/v) pentastarch in liquid nitrogen. Aliquots of cryopreserved peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) products were cryopreserved under similar conditions. Cells were thawed rapidly and filtered before analysis using MFI. Result: Large cellular aggregates were identified in all thawed PBPC samples analyzed (n=4) with a mean reduction in total cells of 19.7 \u00b1 9.8% at 1 hour and 49.8 \u00b1 15.9% at 24 hours. Cellular aggregates \u2264 170 um were visualized, sized and digitally imaged with MFI. Analysis of larger clumps was limited due to size of the analysis chamber. Cell transparency and circularity were unchanged over 24h after thawing and similar to freshly isolated PBPCs. Mononuclear cell yields did not diminish over 24 hours in freshly isolated PBPC (n=3, p>0.05) or in fresh UCB (n=3, p>0.05). Thawed UCB samples did not demonstrate significant clumping and maintained higher yields of total cells compared with PBPCs (p=0.02). Filtering of thawed PBPC products using standard blood transfusion filters (Baxter, 170 um) did not change the qualitative nature of observed cellular aggregates. The loss of cells in PBPC products correlated with early apoptotic mononuclear cells (7AAD-AnnV+). Treatment with DNase I eliminated the presence of observable cell clumping in thawed PBPCs at 24h with a marked improvement in cell yield at 24h (p<0.0001). Conclusion: Micro-flow imaging provides novel insight regarding cellular aggregation of blood stem cell products. Significant cell clumping occurs in cryopreserved PBPC after thawing and aggregates are not removed by standard transfusion filters. Aggregation increases with time after thawing and may influence the final dose of cells available for engraftment after transplantation. Fresh PBPC collections contain few aggregates and both fresh and thawed cryopreserved UCB demonstrated minimal cell clumping. Apoptosis induced by cryopreservation and thawing may contribute to increased aggregation in PBPCs and DNase I appears to preserve higher yields of total cells. New cryoprotectants that limit apoptosis are needed and methods to reduce cell clumping appear warranted. Disclosures: Martin: Brightwell Technologies: Employment.",
