    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3641 Poster Board III-577 Transcription factors including the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ( C/EBP ) family are essential for hematopoietic cell development including myelopoiesis. In response to cytokines and/or infection, C/EBPbeta is important for emergent neutrophil production, whereas C/EBPepsilon induces terminal differentiation of granulocytes. We recently generated C/EBPbeta and C/EBPepsilon double-knockout (KO) mice and demonstrated the dependence of the hematopoietic system on both transcription factors. In order to study inflammatory response of this transgenic in vivo model, bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild-type (WT), single- as well as double-KO mice were cultured either with or without 100 ng/mL LPS and 100 ng/mL mIFNgamma as activating stimuli. After 24 hours of exposure, RNA was extracted, and gene expression difference was interrogated by whole genome microarray (Affymetrix \u00ae , mouse genome 430 2.0). The probes were normalized with the MAS 5.0 software for processing Affymetrix oligonucleotide array data, and genes were considered to be differentially expressed with a fold change level of at least 2. Remarkably, we found more than 75 genes which were up to 20-fold downregulated in the stimulated macrophages of the double-KO mice compared to either single KO or WT mice. A pathway-based analysis indicated that these deregulated genes formed networks associated with development and function of the hematopoietic system, inflammatory response and cell-cell signaling. We confirmed the expression for some of the most highly decreased genes by RT-PCR; for example, interleukin -( IL ) 1beta , IL-12beta , CD38 , macrophage mannose receptor ( Mrc-1 ), toll-like receptor-2 ( TLR-2 ), C-type lectin receptor Mincle , and insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-1 ) were almost not detectable in the activated macrophages of the double-KO mice compared to either single-deficient or WT mice. Lacking these and other important regulators of appropriate immune responses and hematopoiesis, the double KO died between 2 - 3 months of age due to systemic infections including formation of hepatic, peritoneal and lung abscesses with Streptococcus viridians , Enterococcus species and Escherichia coli . In conclusion, phentotype as well as expression pattern of mediators of inflammatory response and hematopoiesis of the double-KO mice was distinct from either the C/EBPbeta - or C/EBPepsilon -KO mice, demonstrating that each transcription factor is important in cytokine expression and host defense, but can in part compensate for each other in the single knockout genotype.
