    "abstract_text": "Abstract 883 Currently Imatinib Mesylate (IM) represent the first line therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Recent data suggest that despite unprecedented rates of complete cytogenetic responses (CCR) and major molecular responses (MMR) obtained, leukemic stem cells (LSC) persist in the majority of patients (pts). LSC have been shown to be resistant to in vitro treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Consequently, discontinuation of IM in pts with undetectable molecular residual leukemia (UMRL) attested by RQ-PCR, leads to molecular relapses in the majority of the cases. Although the persistence of CD34+ CD38- leukemic stem cells has been demonstrated in pts with complete cytogenetic remission (CCR), the persistence of BCR-ABL+ leukemic stem cells in UMRL pts with has not been studied so far. For this purpose, we have performed an extensive analysis of bone-marrow-derived clonogenic and primitive hematopoietic stem cells in 6 pts with RQ-PCR constantly negative in their blood samples. Concerning the treatments; 5 out of 6 pts were off therapy, 3 pts (UPN1, 2, 3) had been treated with interferon-a only (IFN) for 6\u201313 years and their therapy was discontinued for 11, 16 and 8 years, respectively and 2 pts (UPN4 and 5) had been treated successively with IFN and IM and their IM therapy was discontinued for 2 years. One patient (UPN6) had been treated with IM followed by dasatinib and was on dasatinib at the time of the study. UPN7 was previously treated with first IFN then IM (which induced a stable UMRL) and then she switched to dasatinib because of side effect with IM. Bone marrow cells were collected and CD34+ cells purified using immunomagnetic columns. After performing a clonogenic assay, CD34+ cells were used in long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays with weekly half medium changes. At week+5, clonogenic assays were performed and LTC-IC-derived clonogenic cells activity was calculated. For each patient 20 individual and 20 pools of 10 clonogenic cells and 20 individual and 20 pools of 10 LTC-IC derived CFU-C were plucked in order to obtain information in at least 220 CFU-C. After RNA extraction, BCR-ABL was quantified by RQ-PCR and in each positive CFU-C a nested PCR was performed to confirm the results. In one patient (UPN7) a NOD/SCID mouse assay was performed. All 3 pts treated with IFN alone, had BCR-ABL+ clonogenic cells varying from 0.5% (UPN1, 2) to 45 % (UPN3). All 3 had LTC-IC derived CFU-C positive for BCR-ABL (UPN1: 20%; UPN2 5%; UPN3 3%). In two pts previously treated with IFN and IM, clonogenic CFU-C BCR-ABL positivity was 10% and 5% whereas LTC-IC-derived CFU-C was 5% in UPN4) and undetected on UPN5. In UPN6 treated with IM then dasatinib, 5% of CFU-C was BCR-ABL+ whereas 100% of LTC-IC derived CFU-C was positive. The analysis of SCID-NOD assays performed in CD34+ cells from patient UPN7 is ongoing. Overall, these data show, for the first time to our knowledge, that in pts in IFN and IFN/IM-induced long-term remissions, there is persistent clonogenic BCR-ABL+ output maintained by BCR-ABL-expressing stem cells in the absence of relapse. In the only patient with successively treated with IM and dasatinib, 100 % of primitive hematopoietic stem cells are BCR-ABL+, despite PCR-negativity in peripheral blood, suggesting their possible quiescence in vivo and highlighting a theoretical risk of relapse. It remains to be determined if in pts with TKI-induced remissions, the analysis of stem cell compartments could be of use for clinical decisions to discontinue therapy.
