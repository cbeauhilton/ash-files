    "abstract_text": "Mutations of PRF1 and MUNC13\u20134 genes, involved with cellular cytotoxicity, are associated with the familial form of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) type 2 (FHL2) and 3 (FHL3). In all patients with HLH, in which PRF1 mutations had been excluded, we screened MUNC13\u20134 mutations. The 32 exons and their proximal flanking regions of MUNC13\u20134 gene were sequenced by \u201ccycle sequencing\u201d approach (BigDye Terminator, Applied Biosystems). Of 60 patients, 21 had MUNC13\u20134 mutations. 5 were reported mutations: 753+1G>T, 817C>T (R273X); 1389+1G>A; 1822del 12 bp (del V608-A611); 2346\u20139delGGAG (R782FsX12). Of 16 novel mutations 2 (2212C>T and 2650C>T) introduce a stop codon (at Q738 and Q884); 4 cause frameshift: 441delA (P147fsX14), 532delC (Q178fsX70), 3082delC (L1028fsX), and 3226insG (H1076fsX51). Of 8 missense mutations [175G>A (A59T), 419T>C (I140T), 610A>G (M204B), 1241G>T (R414L), 1847A>G (E616G), 2039G>C (R680P), 2570T>G (F857C), 2782C>T (R928C)], 6 fall within the protein functional domains; each of the 2 falling outside was associated with 2 additional pathogenic mutations. The remaining novel 1992+5 G>A and 2448insC \u221212 fall outside the coding region but are close enough to induce alternative splicing. We identified polymorphisms 279C>T and 3198A>G. The 2599A>G (K867E) transition was found in several unrelated families, including one homozygous parent. To assess its frequency we studied 50 consecutive newborns, of which 64% were heterozygous. To understand the effects of the mutations we analysed Munc13\u20134 protein expression from CTL and/or NK cells by western blot using an antibody raised against amino acids 1\u2013262. Trace amounts of protein could be detected only in 5 patients. Analysis of granule polarisation in 2 patients with trace amounts of Munc13\u20134 protein showed many more docked granules visible than in controls, consistent with a block in granule secretion in these patients. Median age at diagnosis of FHL3 was 6.5 months, but 8/21 (38%) patients were diagnosed when older than 5 years, with one young adult of 18 years. CNS disease was present in 10 patients; NK was markedly reduced or absent in all patients tested. MUNC13\u20134 mutations were found in 35% of our HLH patients non type-2. Mutations were almost entirely different from those reported so far and scattered over different exons, but in far most cases they fall within the protein functional domain. Since these patients may develop the disease during adolescence or even later on, not only pediatric but also as adults hematologists should include FHL-2 and 3 in the differential diagnosis of children and young adults with fever, cytopenia, splenomegaly and hypercytokinemia.",
