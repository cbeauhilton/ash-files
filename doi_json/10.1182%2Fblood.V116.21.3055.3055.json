    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3055 Lenalidomide (Revlimid \u00ae ) and dexamethasone is an effective regimen for relapsed/refractory (rel/ref) multiple myeloma (MM) patients (pts) with an overall response rate of 60% and median time to progression of 13.4 months (Dimopoulos ME, et al. Leukemia 2009; 23: 2147-52). We combined lenalidomide with the alkylating agent combination of cyclophosphamide and prednisone\u2014an older regimen with minimal cumulative myelosuppression and good activity as second or third line therapy (Trieu Y, et al, Mayo Clin Proc 2005; 80: 1582). The CPR regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide (CY) on days 1, 8, and 15, lenalidomide on days 1\u201321 and prednisone 100 mg q 2 days in a 28-day cycle. ASA 81 mg/day was given as DVT prophylaxis. Three dose levels were evaluated using a 3 \u00d7 3 dose escalation design. Thirty-two pts were entered between 11/2007-06/2009; median age was 64 (42-80) yrs, 60% were male, and immunoglobulin isotype was IgG in 19 (62%), IgA in 8 (25%) and light chain in 4 (13%) pts. Median \u03b22-microglobulin level was 257 (92-767) nm/L, albumin 39 (34-48) g/L, creatinine 83 (50-126) \u03bcmol/L, platelet count 355 (75-479) \u00d7 10 9 /L and ANC 2.5 (1.1-6.1) \u00d7 10 9 /L. The median number of prior regimens was 2 (1-5). Prior therapy included: ASCT (single in 91%; double in 19%), thalidomide (28%) and bortezomib (50%). FISH cytogenetics were available in 13 pts; 1 had del 13q but none had t(4;14) or del p53. Table 1 summarizes protocol treatment delivered. Table 1.  Dose level . N .

Grade 3\u20134 toxicities during the trial included: thrombocytopenia in 7 (22%) and neutropenia in 9 (29%), managed with dose reduction and/or growth factors; five episodes of febrile neutropenia occurred, all at dose level 3. In cohort 3, other grade 3\u20134 non-hematologic toxicities included 1 episode each of abdominal pain/bacteremia, hypokalemia, fatigue, sick sinus syndrome, cardiac amyloidosis, perforated diverticulum and 2 episodes of DVT. Two heavily pretreated pts developed 2\u00b0 MDS, including 1 previously treated for lymphoma, 43 and 190 mos after the diagnosis of MM. The best response using modified EBMT criteria was documented at a median of 7 (1-26) cycles and included the following: dose level 1 (1 CR, 2 PR); dose level 2 (1 VGPR, 2 PR); dose level 3 (4 CR, 14 VGPR, 11 PR, 1 MR and 1 stable disease). At a median F/U of 16 (5-34) months, 13 pts remain on study and 18 have progressed at a median of 10 (2-23) mos; 1 was lost to F/U and 9 have died of progressive MM. The 1-year actuarial OS and PFS rates are 93% (95% CI 76\u201398%) and 78% (95% CI 60\u201389%), respectively. We conclude: 1) the combination of full doses of the agents in CPR can be given in a 28 day cycle with an acceptable safety profile; 2) the objective response rate (CR + PR + MR) in all 32 pts to date is 94%; 3) the 1-year OS of 93% and PFS of 78% compare favorably with other 3-drug combinations in rel/ref MM pts; 4) further evaluation of this regimen in newly diagnosed pts would be of interest.
