    "abstract_text": "The chicken \u03b2-globin locus represents a well characterized, model system where the relationship between chromatin structure, transcription and DNA replication can be studied. The locus contains several regulatory elements including an intergenic enhancer as well as upstream regulatory elements that may function either alone or in combination with the intergenic enhancer as an LCR. The availability of the recombination proficient chicken B cell line DT40 has allowed the introduction of mutations into the endogenous chicken \u03b2-globin locus and phenotypic analysis after microcell mediated chromosome transfer into human erythroleukemia (K562) cells. Using this system, we have introduced deletions in the chicken \u03b2-globin intergenic enhancer as well as 5\u2032 HS 1,2, and 3. Expression of the embryonic \u03c1 and fetal \u03b2 H chicken globin genes were repressed by the intergenic enhancer, 5\u2032 HS1, or 5\u2032HS2. No \u03c1 or \u03b2 H globin gene expression was detected in K562 cells containing control chicken chromosomes, while \u03c1 and \u03b2 H mRNA were activated when the intergenic enhancer, 5\u2032 HS1, or 5\u2032HS2 were deleted. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments that assayed RNA polmerase II (pol II), GATA-1 and NF-E2 p45/ p18 binding at regulatory elements and gene promoters in targeted cell lines supported this hypothesis and suggested a potential role for 5\u2032HS3 in gene activation. However, targeted deletion of 5\u2032 HS3, unlike the other chicken \u03b2-globin regulatory elements, showed no transcriptional phenotype. Our results demonstrate the intergenic enhancer, 5\u2032HS1, and 5\u2032 HS2 function through a common silencing mechanism involving pol II, GATA-1, and NF-E2/P18. The recent demonstration of the involvement of Pol II in the synthesis of miRNA\u2019s prompted us to investigate the role of miRNA\u2019s in gene silencing in this system. A small miRNA was identified at the intergenic enhancer region. ChIP assays showed the binding of two components of the RISC (Dicer and Ago2) at the chicken globin regulatory elements. These results are consistent with the involvement of RISC and miRNA\u2019s in gene silencing in this system.",
