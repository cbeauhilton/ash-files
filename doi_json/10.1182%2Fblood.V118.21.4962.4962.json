    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4962 Background: Burkits's like (BL) lymphoma is a new pathologic entity with features partially resembling to Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The incidence of BL lymphoma is infrequent and may present with lymph node enlargement, involvement of bone marrow and peripheral blood. The natural history of BL lymphoma and its treatment remains unclear. Here we present a single institution case series of five patients diagnosed with BL lymphoma and their treatment. Methods: We searched the pathology reports of all patients diagnosed with lymphoma over the last one year. No inclusion or exclusion criteria were used. Results: We identified a total of five patients with diagnosis of BL lymphoma. All patients presented with lymphadenopathy and with no involvement of bone marrow, central nervous system or peripheral blood. Table 1 summarizes characteristics of all patients, their chemotherapy regimen and subsequent response to treatment. Conclusion: BL lymphoma is a new pathologic entity with low incidence. Treatment with DA-EPOCH and R-HyperCVAD has very good response rate. The data is limited by single institution case series and limited follow up time. Further studies are recommended to evaluate optimal chemotherapy regimen. Table 1: Characteristics, presentation, treatment and response in patients with BL lymphoma  No . Age . Sex . LDH, .
