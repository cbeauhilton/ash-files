    "abstract_text": "The interactions between leukemic cells and the bone marrow microenvironment play a critical role in angiogenesis, disease progression and cell adhesion mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR). VLA-4 (CD49d) is one of the most important adhesion receptors involved in these interactions. The binding of VLA-4 to fibronectin was shown to protect CLL B-cell from apoptosis (de la Fuente, 1999). The introduction of monoclonal antibodies targeting VLA-4 provides the opportunity for the development of novel treatment strategies. We examined the ability of VLA-4 blocking antibodies to induce apoptosis and overcome CAM-DR of primary B cells from CLL patients. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from consenting CLL patients. Mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. Only samples with over 80% CLL B cells as assessed by flow cytometry (minimum 80% CD19 + /CD5 + cells) were used. HS-5 human stromal cell line was cultured in 24 well plates (10% FCS DMEM media) and grown until they reached confluence. The confluent cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with AIM-V media 24 hours before CLL cells were co-cultured. CLL B cells were incubated in AIM-V media with and without fludarabine (1 mmol/L) for 24 hours, spun and resuspended in AIM-V. CLL B cells were then incubated with or without anti VLA-4 antibodies (BD Biosciences) at 10 \u03bcg/10 6 CLL cells for 2 hours and directly added into a co-culture with HS-5 cells. The CLL B cells remained in the co-culture for 24 hours, and were then collected and analyzed by flow cytometry for apoptosis/cell death by annexin/propidium iodide assay (i.e., total culture time 48 hours). Paired T-test was used to compare B cell viability results. Results: After 48 hour culture, the viability cells cultured in media alone or fludarabine for the first 24 hours were 40.6% (18.2%\u201373.7%) and 8.5% (0.2%\u201317.9%) respectively. Significant rescue from fludarabine induced cell death was seen if CLL B cells were co-cultured with HS-5 stromal cells for the second 24 hours rather than media alone (86.5% vs. 8.5%; p<0.001). The addition of anti VLA-4 antibodies, reduced stromal cell rescue from fludarabine induced apoptosis by 30% (61.5% vs. 86.5%; p= 0.0053). The addition of VLA-4 antibodies to untreated CLL B cells cultured with stromal cells had no effect on cell viability (90.2% vs. 91.2 p=0.59). Conclusion: Stromal cell adhesion rescues CLL B-cells from fludarabine induced apoptosis. Stromal cell rescue of CLL B-cells from drug induced apoptosis can be significantly reduced by blocking VLA-4 mediated cell adhesion of CLL B-cells to stromal cells. Blocking VLA-4 has no effect on the survival of untreated CLL B cells cultured with stromal cells suggesting the interaction mediated by VLA-4 protects against drug induced cell death rather than directly inducing apoptosis. These findings suggest anti VLA-4 antibodies are unlikely to be useful as a single agent therapy for treatment of CLL. However, blocking VLA-4 may enhance the efficacy of other agents used to treat CLL by overcoming adhesion mediated protection against drug induced cell death.",
