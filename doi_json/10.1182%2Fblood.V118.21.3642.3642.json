    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3642 Purpose: The reactive pathologic background in nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) consists of lymphocytes and histocytes. Lymphopenia is a negative prognostic factor in NLPHL as it is also in Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL). In cHL, tumor-associated macrophages recruited from circulating monocytes are a negative prognostic factor for survival. Thus, we studied if the peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count ratio at diagnosis (ALC/AMC-DX), as a surrogate biomarker of the host response against the neoplastic lymphocytic and/or histiocytic (L&H) cells, affects survival in NLPHL. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the association between ALC/AMC-DX and survival in 103 consecutive NLPHL patients that were followed at Mayo Clinic from 1974 to 2010. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) were used for ALC/AMC-DX cut-off value analysis and proportional-hazards models were used to compare survival based on the ALC/AMC-DX ratio. Results: The cohort included 67 (65%) males and 36 (35%) females. Eighty-three percent of patients presented with stage I/II and 17% with stage III/IV. Sixty-five (63%) patients were treated with radiation alone; 20 (20%) patients with chemotherapy alone; and 18 (17%) patients with chemotherapy and radiation. The median follow-up period was 8.9 years (range: 0.3\u201331 years). An ALC/AMC-DX \u2265 2.1 was the best cut-off value for survival with an empirical AUC of 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 0.88), a sensitivity of 70% (95% CI, 61% to 76%) and specificity of 84% (95%CI, 59% to 82%). The cut-off value for ALC/AMC-DX \u2265 2.1 was validated by the k-fold cross validation method, showing a cross validation ROC with an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.93) for an ALC/AMC-DX \u2265 2.1. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, we studied overall survival (OS), lymphoma-specific survival (LSS), progression-free survival (PFS), and time to progression (TTP) based on ALC/AMC-DX \u2265 2.1. Patients with an ALC/AMC-DX \u2265 2.1 experienced an superior OS, LSS, PFS, and TTP compared with patients with an ALC/AMC-DX < 2.1: [OS: median was 22.1 years vs 6.3 years, 10-years OS rates of 89% (95%CI, 80% to 98%) vs 44% (95%CI, 27% to 65%), p < 0.0001, respectively; LSS: median was not reached vs 7.3 years, 10-years LSS rates of 99% (95%CI, 90% to 100%) vs 45% (95%CI, 29% to 67%), p < 0.0001, respectively; PFS: median was 20.6 years vs 4.6 years, 10-years PFS rates of 84% (95%CI, 80% to 97%) vs 26% (95%CI, 18% to 55%), p < 0.0001, respectively; and TTP: median was not reached vs 5.5 years, 10-years TTP rates of 93% (95%CI, 85% to 99%) vs 29% (95%CI, 19% to 57%), p < 0.0001, respectively]. After adjusting for the International Prognostic Factors and the International Prognostic Score, ALC/AMC-DX remained an independent prognostic factor for OS {hazard ratio (HR), 0.42, 95%CI, 0.23 to 0.64, p< 0.004]; LSS [HR, 0.14; 95%CI, 0.04 to 0.23, p <0.0004]; PFS [HR, 0.14; 95%CI, 0.03 to 0.34, p < 0.001], and TTP [HR, 0.16, 95%CI, 0.04\u20130.34, p <0.002]. Conclusion: ALC/AMC-DX is an independent prognostic factor for survival and provides a single biomarker to predict clinical outcomes in NLPHL.
