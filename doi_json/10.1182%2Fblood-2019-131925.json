    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Inherited predisposition to myeloid malignancies in adults may be more common than previously suggested with recent studies suggesting a prevalence of candidate predisposition alleles in 15-20% of patients. An inherited predisposition may not be considered in older AML patients despite significant clinical implications for family members as potential stem cell transplant donors. To better define the role of inherited genetic alterations in older AML patients , we analyzed a unique cohort of newly diagnosed older (>60 years) patients enrolled in) Beat AML\u00ae Master Trial(BAMT) for candidate genes associated with a known or putative inherited cancer predisposition. Methods: We analyzed extracted DNA from skin and/or saliva samples compared to paired leukemia samples of 176 AML patients enrolled in the BAMT. All samples underwent genomic profiling using a modified FoundationOne\u00aeHeme platform (capture-based) and/or the Oregon Health Sciences University panel (amplicon-based), evaluating 477 and 220 genes respectively, with a known role in hematologic malignancies. Germline(GL) variants were identified by the haplotype-based Bayesian genetic variant detector FreeBayes and using variant allele frequency(VAF) values. The pathogenicity and clinical significance of the variants was interpreted according to the 2015 ACMG/AMP guidelines while the AMP/CAP/ASCO guidelines and various disease databases were used in the somatic variant calls. Results : -The mutational landscape of the 176 newly diagnosed older AML patients is detailed in Table 1. Our cohort has a higher proportion of adverse risk patients, consistent with an older AML patient population. 27 pathogenic or likely pathogenic GL variants were detected in 24 AML patients, with a germline mutation prevalence of 14% in this cohort. Deleterious GL mutations were found in the gene DDX41 (5), followed by SBDS (4), CHEK2 (4), MPL (3), BRCA2 (2), HAX1 (2), DNAH9 (2), FANCA (1), FANCL (1), SAMD9 (1), BLM (1), and ATM (1) (Table 2). The types of mutations included missense mutations (9), nonsense mutations (8), frameshift mutations (7), splice site mutations (2), and an exonic deletion (1). Family history of leukemia was available on 129 patients from this cohort. 12 patients have at least one family member with AML. Of these 12 patients, 2 had a deleterious GL alteration identified. Along with the 14% prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic GL mutations , there were an additional 181 GL variants of unknown significance (VUS) in 102 patients, seen in genes implicated in inherited predisposition to hematologic malignancies, most commonly variants in DOCK8 and CREBBP(>5% VUS) with both genes being implicated in leukemogenesis . As skin and/or saliva samples were collected at the time of AML diagnosis, tumor-in-normal presence was expectedly observed. The median VAF for somatic mutations was significantly lower (p < 0.0001) in skin (median 6%; mean 9%; standard deviation (SD) 10%; N=562 variants) than in saliva (median 17%; mean 21%; SD 16%; N=368 variants). In 37 patients who had both saliva and skin tissue concomitantly ,skin had a significantly lower tumor-in-normal presence (median VAF 5%, mean 8%, SD 8%;) than saliva (median 15%, mean 20%, SD 16%)(p < 0.0001). Conclusions: We found a prevalence of 14% pathogenic/ likely pathogenic GL mutations in cancer predisposition genes in this unique cohort of newly diagnosed older AML patients. This finding has potential clinical implications for patients and family members. We also found a large number of VUS in genes implicated in hematological malignancies. Additional studies linking candidate VUS' to familial predisposition to understand contribution to AML predisposition are needed. We are in the process of comparing the manual curation of ACMG classification of pathogenicity with a computational curation algorithm to assess the potential for automated classification of GL variants. Our study suggests the choice of source for germline DNA in patients with AML is variably impacted by leukemic contamination. Cultured skin fibroblasts are the current standard for tumor-normal paired genotyping, with the caveat of being labor intensive and not routinely performed in clinical diagnostic laboratories. This is a critical consideration for rapid GL screening of patients and family members with hematologic malignancies and suspected cancer predisposition.
