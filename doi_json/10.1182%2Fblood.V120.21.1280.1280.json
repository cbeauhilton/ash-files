    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1280 Previous studies have shown that the expression of several leukemia-associated mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion genes transformed human and mouse bone marrow cells in vitro and in vivo . In order to dissect the molecular and cellular targets of the MLL-AF9 fusion, we generated a novel inducible doxycycline (DOX)-regulated transgenic mouse model. Conditional ex vivo activation of MLL-AF9 induced aberrant self-renewal and impaired differentiation of long-term or short-term hematopoietic stem (LT-HSC and ST-HSC), common myeloid progenitor (CMP) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) cells in a fully reversible manner. Direct activation of the fusion in vivo or after transplantation of transgenic bone marrow cells into irradiated hosts induced an aggressive and transplantable disease after a median latency of 80days characterized as acute myelo-monocytic leukemia closely mimicking the human disease. Fusion gene expression and leukemia induction was DOX dosage dependent and reversible upon DOX removal. Activation of MLL-AF9 in isolated LT-HSC or GMP cells in vitro or in vivo resulted in the accumulation of immature blast-like cells with similar immunophenotypes. However, MLL-AF9-expressing stem and progenitor cells displayed distinct properties such as colony formation, differentiation and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Turning-off the fusion resulted in multi-lineage differentiation of LT-HSC-derived cells, whereas GMP-derived cells were limited to mature macrophages and granulocytes suggesting partial maintenance of their original identity. In line with these in vitro observations, lower cell numbers of transplanted LT-HSCs induced a more aggressive leukemia with a significantly shorter latency as compared to ST-HSC, CMP or GMPs. Immunophenotypically 15% of the LT-HSC derived leukemias displayed a CMP\u2013like phenotype and had a median latency of 37d (\u201cearly\u201d) whereas the rest of the cases displayed a GMP-like phenotype with a median latency of 73d (\u201clate\u201d). In contrast, only GMP-like phenotypes and longer latencies were observed upon transplanting ST-HSCs (75d), CMPs (72d) or GMPs (100d). Transplantation of blasts from \u201cearly\u201d LT-HSC- and GMP-derived leukemias into secondary recipients induced the disease after similar latency, however, cytarabine (Ara-C) treatment significantly delayed only the disease induced by GMP- but not by LT-HSC-derived blasts. Gene expression profiling in immortalized pre-leukemic cells revealed down-regulation of over 300 genes, including several well-known MLL targets such as Meis1 , HoxA5 , HoxA9 and HoxA10 upon reducing the levels of MLL-AF9 expression. Likewise, we observed a global decrease in histone H3 lysine 79 dimethylation consistent with a Dot1l function in MLL-AF9 driven leukemia. LT-HSC-derived (\u201cearly\u201d) blasts displayed distinct genetic signatures with > 400 genes highly and > 1300 genes lowly expressed (p001 fc1.5), clearly separating them from the GMP-derived blasts. Evi-1 and Erg , two prognostic markers in patient-derived gene signatures, stood out among these genes. The aggressive \u201cearly\u201d LT-derived murine leukemias showed high Evi-1 and Erg expression levels ( Evi-1 high, Erg high) as compared to the \u201clate\u201d LT-derived ( Evi-1 low, Erg high ) or the GMP-derived leukemias ( Evi-1 l ow , Erg low ). These observations suggest that the previously reported poor prognosis associated with elevated EVI-1 and/or ERG expression might directly reflect the cell of origin of the disease. We are currently exploiting our highly informative MLL-AF9 disease model to evaluate the functional relevance of novel origin-dependent MLL-AF9 target genes and to identify novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.
