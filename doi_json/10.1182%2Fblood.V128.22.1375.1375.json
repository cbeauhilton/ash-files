    "abstract_text": "The release of biologically intact platelets from in vitro-grown megakaryocytes remains one of the challenges in an attempt to replace donor-derived platelets with platelets prepared from in vitro-grown megakaryocytes. Thrombopoiesis, the process by which megakaryocytes release platelets, is thought to occur as megakaryocytes exit from the medullar space and transit into the blood stream. Two-photon fluorescence microscopy studies by several groups have documented megakaryocytes transitioning into the blood stream and extending mostly a single protrusion that appears to release large cytoplasmic fragments downstream. These studies have been widely interpreted to support platelet release in the bone marrow environment. A counter proposal made by Dr. William Howell over 75 years ago is that either whole megakaryocytes or large cytoplasmic fragments circulate to the lungs and release platelets in the lungs. Studies by our group infusing in vitro-grown megakaryocytes (both human and mouse) have shown that infused megakaryocytes do indeed become entrapped in the lungs and release platelets. These in vivo-released platelets have a much longer half-life than in vitro-prepared platelets from static cultures and have the same size distribution and nearly the same functionality as infused donor-derived platelets. Using confocal intravital microscopy, we now directly visualized the lungs of recipient NOD-SCID interferon 2 receptor \u03b3-deficient mice during the infusion of calcein-loaded CD34 + -derived megakaryocytes. Infused human megakaryocytes were immediately arrested in the pulmonary bed in vessels ~50 \u00b5m in diameter. Each cell then extended several distinct protrusions winding down presumed pulmonary capillaries that are presumably wrapped around alveoli. Some of these protrusions reached 200-300 \u00b5m in length and assumed the appearance of beads on a string. Consistent with our recently published data, this thrombopoiesis process appears to take 30 minutes to be near-complete, similar to the timeframe we showed for detecting newly released human platelet-like particles after megakaryocyte infusion. At 30 minutes, remaining bodies of the megakaryocytes are still present and we presume these are mostly the remaining nuclei. To better define whether the pulmonary bed is unique for releasing platelets, we also infused megakaryocytes intra-arteriole rather than intravenously to have the megakaryocytes encounter other organ capillary beds before the lung. These studies showed poor platelet release compared to parallel studies in mice receiving the megakaryocytes intravenously. Many of the intra-arterial infused megakaryocytes were entrapped in the spleen and very few were notable in other organs, including the lungs, liver and kidney. Our studies showed that megakaryocytes can shed platelets in the lungs where they may take advantage of the unique three-dimensional organization of the pulmonary vascular bed, flow conditions, vascular surface receptors and glycocalyx as well as a sudden shift from hypoxic to normoxic conditions. Whether these features of the pulmonary vascular bed can be simulated ex vivo and whether this will enhance true platelet release from megakaryocytes in vitro needs to be examined.
