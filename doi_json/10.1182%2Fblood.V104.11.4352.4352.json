    "abstract_text": "AIM To clarify the mechanisms of the cardiac side effects of arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 ) in leukemia treatment, the effects of As 2 O 3 on protein kinase C(PKC) and cytosolic calcium ([Ca 2+ ] i ) in ventriclar myocardium of guinea pig were investigated. METHODS Fluo-3/AM fluorescent probe tagged [Ca 2+ ] i of guinea pig\u2019s ventriclar myocardium, detected the [Ca 2+ ] i , by laser confocal microscopy before and after exposed to As 2 O 3 . Phosphorus radioisotope assay was used to detect the activity of PKC on cell membrane or in cytoplasm. DNA ladders of ventriclar myocardium in Tyrode\u2019s solution after exposed to As 2 O 3 were evaluated. RESULTS The cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] i did not change when incubated guinea pig\u2019s ventriclar myocardium in Tyrode\u2019s solution with 0.5\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 As 2 O 3 , after incubated in2\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 As 2 O 3 for 6min, [Ca 2+ ] i began to increase and was continuous increasing for about 9min. After exposed to 10\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 As 2 O 3 for less than 3 min, the [Ca 2+ ] i kept on increasing till the end (about 27min) of the examination and could not recover. The increasing of [Ca 2+ ] i could be partly blocked by calcium channel blocking agents\u2014verapamil and nifedipin. The PKC of myocardial cells began to rise after incubated in an As 2 O 3 changing concentration culture media for 3 hours, which initial As 2 O 3 was 10\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 , and the DNA ladders appeared after incubated in it for10 hours. No DNA ladders appeared when incubated in an As 2 O 3 culture media in which the initial As 2 O 3 concentration was under 5\u03bcmol\u2022L \u22121 . CONCLUSIONS As 2 O 3 can active PKC, increase cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] i and promote apoptosis of myocardial cells. The promoting apoptosis action of As 2 O 3 is closely related to the lasting activation of PKC. The initial action target of As 2 O 3 is cell membrane."
