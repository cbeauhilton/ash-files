    "abstract_text": "Object: To the effect of Fe 3 O 4 -magnetic nanoparticle loaded with DNR on In order to study the multidrug-resistant reversal effect of Fe 3 O 4 -magnetic nanoparticle loaded with DNR in vivo. Methods: K562-n,a leukemia cell line with high tumorigenicity in nude mice and its multidrug-resistant counterpart K562-n/VCR cells were inoculated subcutaneously into each groins of nude mice (5\u00d710 6 cells/each) to establish a human leukemia xenograft model. The mice were randomly divided into group A receiving normal saline, group B receiving anti-tumor drugs daunorubicin (DNR), group C receiving Fe 3 O 4 -magnetic nanoparticle, group D receiving Fe 3 O 4 -magnetic nanoparticle loaded with DNR, and group E receiving Fe 3 O 4 -magnetic nanoparticle containing DNR with a magnetic field built on the surface of tumor tissues. After 20 days treatments, mice were killed and tumor tissues were isolated for pathological observation. The volume and weight of tumors were measured, then tumor suppression rate was calculated. The side effects of DNR loaded Fe 3 O 4 -magnetic nanoparticle were also evaluated. Results: The results showed that DNR loaded Fe 3 O 4 -magnetic nanoparticle can significantly suppress the growth of K562-n/VCR tumor in vivo , DNR alone can greatly suppress the growth of K562-n, Fe 3 O 4 -magnetic nanoparticle loaded with DNR can not further inhibit the K562-n tumor. Conclusion: In conclusion, Fe 3 O 4 -magnetic nanoparticle loaded with DNR can reverse the leukemia multidrug resistance in vivo."
