    "abstract_text": "The prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is poor due to frequent relapse after initial remission. The development of new approaches to postremission therapy for elimination of minimal residual disease remains a major scientific and clinical challenge. We strive to combine two different innovative therapeutic concepts to develop a new specific and personalized treatment for AML. siRNAs are used to knock down either a gene that drives leukemogenesis due to genetic alterations in specific cases of AML (e.g., FLT3 , NPM1 ) or a gene that is essential for the survival of the leukemic cells (e.g., BRD4 , MCL1 , PLK1 ). By adding a triphosphate modification to the 5\u2019 end, the siRNA molecules additionally become ligands for the cytosolic pattern recognition receptor RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene I). Its activation mimics viral infection and leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines and induction of apoptosis in the target cell. We expect these bifunctional molecules to result in a decrease of viable AML cells and in the induction of an immune response similar to an active immunization. This concept was successfully tested in vitro for several target genes in AML cell lines. We could demonstrate that the specific gene knockdown leads to inhibited proliferation, increased apoptosis and higher sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. Activation of RIG-I by triphosphate-modified RNA additionally stimulated an inflammatory response by the leukemic cells and increased the apoptosis rate. A major hurdle for all siRNA-based anti-cancer strategies is the specific delivery of the RNA into tumor cells. In vivo liposomal transfection of siRNA molecules has been used in various tumor models, but generally results in ineffective and unspecific delivery. We are testing DNA-based nanoparticles coupled with molecules that target receptors specific for or overexpressed on AML cells. By coupling bifunctional siRNA molecules to these nanoparticles, they should be efficiently and selectively transported into the cytosol of AML cells. Proof-of-concept in vivo studies in AML mouse models are in preparation. The long-term goal of this project is the development of a set of bifunctional siRNA molecules for the individualized treatment of AML. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
