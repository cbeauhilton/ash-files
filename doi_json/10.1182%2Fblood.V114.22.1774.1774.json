Since its inception in 1982, the Du\u0308sseldorf MDS Registry has captured 3598 patients with MDS, of whom 21 % live in the town district of Du\u0308sseldorf. Between 1996-2005 we are confident that all MDS patients residing in the town district of Du\u0308sseldorf were entered and followed in the registry through regular follow-ups. As yearly age- and sex-specific population counts are also available for Du\u0308sseldorf, the Registry provides a unique opportunity to estimate MDS disease frequency. Here we aim to quantify the incidence and prevalence of MDS disease subtypes. Methods Patients were identified from the MDS Registry. Age- and sex-specific yearly population counts were obtained from the Statistical Office of North-Rhine Westphalia. The number of residents in Du\u0308sseldorf minimally increased during the study period from 1996 to 2005 (mean: 571,000 residents). The number of patients with a first-time MDS diagnosis in a given calendar year (incident cases) was divided by the total Du\u0308sseldorf population in that year to estimate incidence. Prevalence was estimated by dividing the number of existing plus incident MDS patients in a given year by the total population of Du\u0308sseldorf that year. Incidence (per 100,000 person-years (PY) and prevalence per 100,000 persons are presented with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated using the delta and Wilson methods, respectively. Low-risk MDS was defined as WHO subtypes RA, RCMD or MDS with del(5q). High-risk included subtypes RAEB-I and RAEB-II. Results 344 MDS patients were included in our analyses (279 incident patients). Incidence and prevalence of low-risk MDS was 2.87 (95%CI 2.46\u20133.35) per 100,000PY and 12.4 (95%CI 11.5\u201313.4) per 100,000 persons, respectively, with no difference between men and women ( Table ). High-risk disease was less common. The incidence of high-risk disease in men appeared to be higher (1.22 (95%CI 0.87\u20131.72) per 100,000PY) than in women (0.63 (95%CI 0.40\u20130.99) per 100,000PY). Prevalence of high-risk disease among men was statistically significantly higher in men compared to women (2.93 (95%CI 2.35 \u2013 3.65) per 100,000 persons) and 1.56 (95%CI 1.17 \u2013 2.08) per 100,000 persons), respectively ( Table ). Conclusion In this population-based study we found that MDS more common in men than in women. The majority of MDS cases had low-risk disease. Incidence and prevalence of high risk disease (but not low risk) is higher in men compared to women. Financial disclosures: This study was supported by Amgen Inc.
