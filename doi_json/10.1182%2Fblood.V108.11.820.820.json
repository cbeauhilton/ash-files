    "abstract_text": "Background. The strongest established prognostic factors for follicular lymphoma are age and clinical factors. Biologic studies suggest a major role for the host immunologic environment in follicular lymphomagenesis, which is in part determined by host genetic background. Cytokines are key regulators of immune function and regulation, are highly polymorphic, and have been implicated in lymphoma etiology and prognosis. We evaluated the hypothesis that inherited variability in cytokine and related immune genes impact overall survival in follicular lymphoma. Methods. We genotyped 73 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 44 candidate cytokine and immune genes in 278 follicular lymphoma patients who participated in a population-based case-control study conducted from 1998\u20132000 in the Detroit, Iowa, Los Angeles and Seattle SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) cancer registries. Baseline clinical data and survival through early 2005 were obtained from cancer registry files. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the association between individual SNPs and overall survival, adjusting for age, demographic and clinical factors. We also used parallel modeling strategies to identify the best summary multi-SNP risk score to predict survival, and applied these results in a time-dependent receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) analysis. Results. The median age at diagnosis was 57 years (range, 25\u201374), and 59 (21%) of the patients died during follow-up, with a median follow-up of 59 months (range, 27 \u2013 78 months) for surviving patients. In multivariate modeling, SNPs in IL8 (rs4073; HR TT =2.14, 1.26\u20133.63), IL2 (rs2069762; HR GT/TT =1.80, 1.06\u20133.05), IL12B (rs3212227; HR AA/CC =1.83, 1.06\u20133.06), and IL1RN ( rs454078 ; HR AA =1.93, 1.11\u20133.34) were the strongest and most robust predictors of survival. A summary score of the number of deleterious genotypes from these four genes was strongly associated with survival ( p =1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) after accounting for demographic and clinical variables (HR=2.06 per deleterious genotype, 1.52\u20132.79). A combination of the four SNPs and the demographic and clinical risk scores was strongly associated with survival ( p =1.8 \u00d7 10 \u221211 ); the 5-year Kaplan Meier survival estimates were 96% (93%\u2013100%), 72% (62%\u201383%) and 58% (48%\u201372%) for low, intermediate, and high risk groups respectively. In a time-dependent ROC analysis the three risk groups had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 at 72 months of follow-up (95% CI 0.72\u20130.93). Conclusion: Host genetic variability in immune genes, particularly IL8, IL2, IL12B, and IL1RN , individually and particularly in combination, was associated with overall survival in follicular lymphoma after accounting for demographic and clinical factors. Host immunogenetics is a promising class of prognostic factors in follicular lymphoma that warrants further evaluation.",
