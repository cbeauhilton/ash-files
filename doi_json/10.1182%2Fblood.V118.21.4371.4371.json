    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4371 Objective To investigate the quantity and their pathways to damage hematopoietic cells of CD8+CD25+ and CD8+HLA-DR+ effector T cells in peripheral blood (PB) of the patients with severe aplastic anemia(SAA) and explore the heterogeneous immunopathogenesis of SAA further. Methods The quantity of CD8 + CD25 + and CD8 + HLA-DR + cells in PB and the expressions of perforin, granzyme B, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b2(TNF -\u03b2) and FasL of 29 SAA (14 untreated and 15 recovered) patients and 12 normal controls were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results The ratio of CD8 + CD25 + T cells in CD8 + T cells was (3.67\u00b12.58)% in untreated SAA patients, (5.19\u00b14.29)% in recovered patients and (4.84\u00b12.31)% in normal controls, and the ratios of CD8 + CD25 + T cells in CD3 + cells in three groups were (2.25\u00b11.35)%, (2.98\u00b11.35)% and (2.11\u00b11.88)% respectively. There was no statistic difference among 3 groups( P >0.05). The ratio of CD8 + HLA-DR + T cells in CD8 + T cells was (39.30\u00b18.13)% in untreated patients, which was significantly higher than that of recovered patients[(20.65\u00b15.38%)] and controls [(18.34\u00b16.68%)]( P <0.001). There was no statistic difference between recovered patients and controls( P >0.05). CD8 + HLA-DR + T cells in CD3 + cells was (27.81\u00b17.10)% in untreated group, higher than that of recovered patients (12.02\u00b13.03)% and controls(8.50\u00b12.33)%( P <0.01). And the ratio in recovered group was higher than in control group( P <0.05). The expressions of perforin, granzyme B, TNF-\u03b2 and FasL of CD8 + HLA-DR+ T cells of untreated SAA patients were 8.51% A96.08% A72.11% and 94.25% respectively, higher than those of recovered patients(1.78% A85.20% A34.38% A51.20%)and controls(1.86% A82.09% A17.92% A32.91%). There was no statistic difference between recovered patients and controls( P >0.05). Conclusion There were elevated quantity of CD8 + HLA-DR + T cells and high expressions of perforin, granzyme B, TNF-\u03b2 and FasL in SAA, which might contribute to the bone marrow failure of SAA.
