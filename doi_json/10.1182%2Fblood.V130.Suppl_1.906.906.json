    "abstract_text": "Background: In this prospective study, we compared VRD with Ld as induction therapy for newly-diagnosed Multiple myeloma patients. The primary objective of this study is to compare the progression-free survival in the 2 arms. Methods: Between September 2014 and Oct 2016, 144 patients have been recruited and randomly assigned to receive 4 cycles of either Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 SC on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 with Lenalidomide 15mg/day from day 1 to 14 ( Arm A ) or Lenalidomide 25 mg/day from day 1 to 21 ( Arm B ). Patients in both arms received oral dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1,8,15 and 22. Both treatment regimens were 28-day cycles. All patients received 75 mg aspirin daily, acyclovir prophylaxis and monthly zoledronic acid. Response assessment was done at the end of the 4 th cycle using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria. The study was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee (Ref IEC/NP-264/01-08-2014, RP-7/2014). Results: These are the results from an analysis of 143 patients (arm A-74, arm B-69). Baseline characteristics of patients were similar in both arms with respect to age, gender, ISS and DS stage, immunoglobulin subtype and serum LDH. Patients' median age is 56 years (range 31-70) in arm A and 52 years (range 28-69) in arm B. Gender M/F: Arm A 54/20 and 43/26 in arm B. ISS stage III 51 (68.9%) arm A vs 44 (63.8%) arm B. Serum LDH raised to >250 u/L was observed in 25 (44.6%) vs 31 (52.5%) in arms A and B, p=0.4. Revised staging including ISS and serum LDH at baseline: stage III 47 (81%) and 37 (65%) in arms A and B respectively. 14 (18.9%) and 19 (27.5%) of patients had light chain myeloma in arms A and B respectively. Overall response rates (sCR+CR+VGPR+PR) is 78.4% vs 73.9% in arms A and B respectively, p=0.6; sCR + CR 21 (28.4%) and 21 (30.4%) respectively, p=0.86. Median follow-up 17.1 months (range 1 to 33). Median overall survival (OS) is 30.2 months (95% CI 28.2 to 32.2) and 28.6 months (95%CI 26 to 31.3) in arms A and B respectively, p=0.3. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 27.8 months (95%CI 25.4 to 30.2) and 28 months (95%CI 24.6 to 31.4) respectively, p=0.3. Estimated one-year OS is 88% vs 85% in arms A and B, and PFS 83% vs 72%, respectively. Grade 3 anemia occurred in one patient in arm B, and grade 3 deep vein thromboses in one patient in arm A. One patient in arm A developed grade 4 myelosuppression leading to therapy change at the end of the first cycle. Conclusion: In this analysis - response rates and median progression-free survival are similar in both arms. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
