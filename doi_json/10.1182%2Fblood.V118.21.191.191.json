    "abstract_text": "Abstract 191 Outside-in signal transduction is one of several autocrine amplification loops that platelets employ to stabilize and consolidate a platelet thrombus following their adhesion to each other or to components of the extracellular matrix. Binding of soluble fibrinogen to activated integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 on the platelet surface, or binding of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 to platelet-immobilized fibrinogen, initiates an outside-in signaling cascade that results in the activation of integrin \u03b23-associated Src family kinases, which in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing adaptor protein, Fc\u03b3RIIa. \u201cActivation\u201d of Fc\u03b3RIIa sets off a cascade of events that result in the assembly and activation of other key signaling intermediates, including the tyrosine kinase Syk and phospholipase C\u03b32(PLC\u03b32), through its lipase activity, generates lipid products that support a multitude of cellular activation responses, including cytoskeletal rearrangements leading to platelet shape change and spreading, secretion of platelet granules, and activation of additional cell surface integrins. We have previously shown that either antibody-mediated or genetic disruption of the functional interaction between integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and Fc\u03b3RIIa blocks tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc\u03b3RIIa, Syk, and PLC\u03b32, and inhibits platelet spreading on immobilized fibrinogen. The physiological significance of Fc\u03b3RIIa in supporting platelet thrombus formation, however, remains unknown. To further explore the importance of Fc\u03b3RIIa in platelet function, we compared the relative ability of wild-type Fc\u03b3RIIa-negative and transgenic Fc\u03b3RIIa-positive (Fc\u03b3RIIa TGN ) murine platelets to support thrombosis and hemostasis in a number of well-accepted models of platelet function. Fc\u03b3RIIa TGN platelets exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and PLC\u03b32 and increased spreading upon interaction with immobilized fibrinogen. Fc\u03b3RIIa TGN platelets also retracted a fibrin clot faster than did wild-type Fc\u03b3RIIa-negative platelets. When anti-coagulated whole blood was perfused over a collagen-coated flow chamber under conditions of arterial shear, the rate and extent of adhesion, aggregation, and thrombus formation was significantly increased for Fc\u03b3RIIa TGN platelets compared to their wild-type murine counterparts. Addition of Fab fragments specific for Fc\u03b3RIIa to whole blood derived from either humans or Fc\u03b3RIIa TGN mice strongly inhibited thrombus formation in the arterial in vitro flow chamber assay. Finally, to examine the in vivo relevance of Fc\u03b3RIIa, mice were subjected to two models of vascular injury: electrolytic injury of the femoral vein and laser injury of cremaster arterioles. In both in vivo models, Fc\u03b3RIIa TGN mice displayed increased thrombus formation compared with their wild-type, Fc\u03b3RIIa-negative counterparts. Taken together, these data establish Fc\u03b3RIIa as a physiologically-important functional conduit for \u03b1IIb\u03b23\u2013mediated outside-in signaling, and suggest that modulating the activity of this novel integrin/ITAM pair might be effective in controlling thrombosis.
