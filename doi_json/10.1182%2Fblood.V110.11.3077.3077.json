    "abstract_text": "Animal hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) models and several small clinical trials showed that successful engraftment can be achieved across HLA-haplotype difference after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). Furthermore, decreased graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and transplantation-related mortality (TRM) after RIC was shown in a swine leukocyte antigen-haploidentical HCT experiment. Therefore, a protocol investigating the role of RIC in HLA-haploidentical familial donor HCT was initiated in April 2004 and 20 patients [13 male and 7 female; median age 26.5 years (16\u201365)] without HLA-matched donor enrolled until June 2007. The diagnosis were AML (n=9), ALL (n=4), acute biphenotypic leukemia (n=1), MDS (n=4), and SAA (n=2), and all patients had high-risk features, i.e. first complete remission (CR) but with high-risk chromosomal abnormality (n=1), first CR after salvage (n=1), second CR (n=6), recurrent/refractory state (n=7), immunotherapy failure (n=4), and high-risk MDS (RAEB-1, n=1). The RIC included iv busulfan 3.2 mg/kg \u00d7 2, fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 \u00d7 6, plus anti-thymocyte globulin [Thymoglobuline 3 mg/kg (n=17) or Lymphoglobuline 15 mg/kg (n=3)] \u00d7 4. After receiving G-CSF, the donors (13 mothers; 5 offsprings; and 2 HLA-haploidentical siblings) underwent 2 or 3 daily leukapheresis, and the collected cells were given to patients without T cell depletion [medians of; 7.9 (3.7\u201312.1)\u00d710 8 /kg MNC, 6.9 (3.6\u201373.5)\u00d710 6 /kg CD34 + cells, and 4.6 (1.8\u20138.5)\u00d710 8 /kg CD3 + cells]. GVHD prophylaxis was cyclosporine 3 mg/kg/day iv from day -1 and a short course of methotrexate. As a part of separate phase 1 study, the two most-recently enrolled patients received additional donor CD34 + cell-derived NK cells 6 weeks after HCT. Except one patients with SAA who died due to K. pneumoniae sepsis on day 18, all 19 evaluable patients engrafted with ANC> 500/\u03bcl median 17 days (12\u201353) and platelet> 20,000/\u03bcl median 23 days (12\u2013100) after HCT. Eight patients experienced acute GVHD (grades I, II, III, and IV; 2, 3, 2, and 1, respectively). Cumulative incidences (CI) of overall and grade II-IV acute GVHD were 40 and 30%, respectively. Eight patients experienced chronic GVHD (limited, 4; extensive, 4; CI, 51%). Fourteen showed positive CMV antigenemia, while 2 suffered CMV colitis, which resolved after treatment. As early as 2 weeks after HCT, 15 of 16 evaluable patients, and, by 4 weeks, all of 17 evaluable patients showed donor chimerism \u226595% on STR-PCR, which was maintained until 24 weeks in all 11 patients tested. Thirteen patients are alive after median follow-up of 13.6 months (1.5\u201337.9; Kaplan-Meier survival, 55.6%). Of 16 patients with acute leukemia and high-risk MDS, 8 remain alive without recurrence (event-free-survival, 40.9%). Two patients died of K. pneumoniae sepsis and grade IV acute GVHD, respectively (CI of TRM, 11%). Immune recovery in 10 patients without relapse for > 6 months showed robust lymphocyte contents and immunoglobulin levels at 6 months (means of; 1,060/ul CD3 + , 222/ul CD4 + , 767/ul CD8 + cells, and 1,317 mg/dl IgG) and 12 months. After RIC, consistent engraftment and durable complete donor hematopoietic chimerism can be achieved from HLA-haploidentical familial donor. The frequencies of GVHD and TRM were low."
