    "abstract_text": "Background : Myelofibrosis (MF) is characterized by progressive bone marrow dysfunction, extramedullary hematopoiesis, massive splenomegaly, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, severe constitutional symptoms, cachexia and premature death. INCB018424 is a potent, selective inhibitor of JAK 1 and 2 which has demonstrated impressive clinical activity in the early portion of a phase 1/2 study in patients with PMF and Post-PV/ET MF. Methods : Following the initial dose escalation phase with a BID schedule (N=11), both twice daily (10 mg BID to 25 mg BID, N=56) and once daily (25 mg QD to 200 mg QD, N= 37) dose regimens were explored. Endpoints included spleen size assessed by manual palpation, constitutional symptoms assessed using the Modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) and JAK2 allele burden. Exercise capacity is being assessed using the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and body mass and composition are being assessed using standard methods. Safety was assessed by collection of adverse events and monitoring of laboratory data. Results : Over 100 patients are currently enrolled in the study, with a mean exposure to drug of > 5 months. Twenty percent of patients have received INCB018424 for > 9 months. INCB018424 is associated with a rapid reduction of splenomegaly in over 93% of patients from a mean baseline spleen size >20 cm, with 50% or greater reduction being observed in 35% of patients dosed with 10 mg BID or 50 mg QD, and 59% of patients dosed with 25mg BID regimens. These declines nearly always occur within the first month of therapy, with further, slower decreases often observed thereafter. In responding patients, spleen size reduction persists for the duration of therapy (currently up to one year follow-up). Constitutional symptoms are reported with high frequency in the study population as assessed by the MFSAF: night sweats, pruritis and fatigue were reported by >60%, >45% and >90% of patients respectively. Improvements in self-assessed symptom scores (mean % improvement of 40% to 60%) occurred by the first assessment at week 2. Activity limitations are also reported by a high proportion of MF patients; 70% of respondents reported impaired ability to exercise or get around, with a mean score >5 on the 11-point MFSAF scale; INCB018424 therapy was associated with rapid (within 2 weeks) and marked (40% or more) improvement in self-assessed score. There was a dose-dependent weight gain, most pronounced in patients with the lowest body mass index (BMI) values at baseline. Profound reductions in inflammatory cytokines were observed by the first evaluation at week 2 in virtually all patients, and were maintained during therapy. INCB018424 is generally well tolerated with the primary toxicity being dose-dependent grade 3 or 4 reversible thrombocytopenia which occurred in 0%, 18% and 32% of patients dosed with 10 mg BID, 50 mg QD or 25 mg BID. Conclusions : INCB18424 shows unprecedented and durable clinical efficacy in reducing spleen size and improving constitutional symptoms in patients with MF. Results from proactive dose modification regimens, assessments of exercise capacity, MRI-based spleen volume assessment and body composition determination will be presented."
