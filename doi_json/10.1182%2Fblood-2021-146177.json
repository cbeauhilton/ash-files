    "abstract_text": "Background: Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) is a novel chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy that is being evaluated in the CARTITUDE-1 trial (NCT03548207) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who are triple-class exposed (to immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody). As there is no clear standard of care for this patient population, and due to an absence of direct head-to-head trials evaluating cilta-cel and other relevant treatments, indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) between cilta-cel and treatments used in current clinical practice, ie, physician's choice of treatment (PCT), have been previously conducted. Meta-analyses were performed to derive single summary effect estimates for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) by pooling ITCs evaluating cilta-cel versus PCT in patients with triple-class exposed RRMM. Methods: ITCs examining the comparative effectiveness of cilta-cel versus PCT on OS and PFS were included. Data on cilta-cel corresponded to the February 2021 data-cut for CARTITUDE-1. Data on PCT was leveraged from the following sources: (i) the Flatiron database, a primarily US community-based multiple myeloma registry, (ii) the long-term follow-up results of three global RRMM daratumumab randomized clinical trials (POLLUX [NCT02076009], CASTOR [NCT02136134], and EQUULEUS [NCT01998971]), (iii) the US-based retrospective MAMMOTH study, and (iv) a representative German patient registry maintained by OncologyInformationService (OIs). In each ITC, the PCT group was comprised of patients who satisfied key eligibility criteria for CARTITUDE-1 and was made comparable to CARTITUDE-1 using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Hence, the ITCs were deemed appropriate to meta-analyze. The meta-analyses used a robust variance estimator to account for the use of CARTITUDE-1 in each pairwise ITC. The main meta-analyses considered all participants treated with cilta-cel in CARTITUDE-1 compared with PCT. Sensitivity analyses considered ITC effect estimates based on all enrolled participants in CARTITUDE-1. Pooled summary effect estimates were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Based on availability of data, the main meta-analyses included four ITCs for OS and three ITCs for PFS. Cilta-cel was associated with a statistically significant improvement in OS (HR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.34; Figure 1) and PFS (HR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.63; Figure 2) compared to PCT. Sensitivity analyses including all enrolled participants confirmed the results of the main meta-analyses. Conclusions: In the meta-analyses, cilta-cel demonstrated a significant advantage over PCT in terms of OS and PFS, highlighting its potential as an effective therapy in patients with triple-class exposed RRMM.
