    "abstract_text": "C/EBP\u03b1 is a critical regulator of early myeloid differentiation. Resent study showed that the loss of C/EBP\u03b1 led to an augmentation of competitive repopulating activity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Our previous study using the transgenic (Tg) mice expressing an inducible form of C/EBP\u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1-ER) also showed that in vivo activation of C/EBP\u03b1 by 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-HT) led to remarkable decrease of HSC population (Abstract #671, Blood  104 , 193a , 2004 ). In order to investigate further the role of C/EBP\u03b1 in HSC homeostasis, we purified CD34 \u2212 c-Kit hi Sca-1 hi lineage \u2212 cells (CD34 \u2212 KSLs) from the C/EBP\u03b1-ER Tg mice and examined the effect of C/EBP\u03b1 activation on their growth, self-renewal, and differentiation potential. Clonal proliferation assay showed that the growth of about 95 % of CD34 \u2212 KSLs was suppressed in the presence of 4-HT. Single cell colony assay showed that the percentage of CFU-GEMM and CFU-MK remarkably decreased from 80 % to 2.1 % and from 2.1 % to 0 %, respectively by 4-HT treatment. In contrast, percentage of CFU-GEM increased from 0 % to 74 %, indicating that differentiation potential to megakaryocytes (MKs) was selectively lost by C/EBP\u03b1 activation. To gain more insights into the cell fate determination at clonal level, we performed paired daughter cell colony assay. Sorted CD34 \u2212 KSLs were clonally deposited into 96-well plates and allowed to divide once to generate daughter cell pairs, which were then separated by micromanipulation, and transplanted into control or 4-HT containing methylcellulose. 26 daughter cell pairs out of assessable 41 colony pairs lost MK differentiation capacity in the presence of 4-HT. In contrast, remaining 15 pairs took the same fate of differentiation in control and 4-HT. Surprisingly, while most of the CD34 \u2212 KSLs stopped their growth upon C/EBP\u03b1 activation, approximately 5 % of the cells proliferated even in the presence of 4-HT. These cells grew from a single cell to generate more than 45 cells and sustained multipotentiality to generate GEMM-colonies even after 8-days of culture. To further examine the effect of C/EBP\u03b1 activation on self-renewal potential of HSCs, clonally sorted CD34 \u2212 KSLs were allowed to divide once in 4-HT- or control-media, and the fate of each daughter cell was traced in methylcellulose. The result showed that GEMM-colony pairs were generated at similar frequency in control and 4-HT culture, indicating that the self-renewal capacity of CD34 \u2212 KSLs was not affected by C/EBP\u03b1. These results indicated that activation of C/EBP\u03b1 caused growth suppression and impaired differentiation to MKs in the majority of CD34 \u2212 KSLs. However, small fraction does not respond to C/EBP\u03b1 activation, indicating CD34 \u2212 KSLs could be classified into two subpopulations by their sensitivity to C/EBP\u03b1.",
