    "abstract_text": "The FLT3, located at band 13q12 and encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), is one of the most frequently mutated genes in hematologic malignancies including ALL, MDS, and AML. The most common mutation of the FLT3 is an internal tandem duplication in exons 14 and 15, whereas other mutations have also been found at and around codon 835 of exon 20. These activating mutations promote constitutive RTK activity in the absence of ligand, proposing FLT3 as an attractive therapeutic target for directed inhibition. However, many questions with regards to the biology of FLT3 and its role in leukemogenesis remain to be clarified. Despite its highly frequent mutations, FLT3 has never been reported to fuse to any other genes, a phenomenon usually observed in other RTKs. Here, we report a case of a novel fusion gene between FLT3 and ETV6 at 12p13, a well-known target for a number of translocations. The patient, a 68-year-old female, was diagnosed as myeloproliferative disorder with hypereosinophilia in May 2002. Peripheral blood showed WBC 33.6x10 6 /L (3% myelocytes, 33.5% neutrophils, 54% eosinophils, 1.5% basophils, 1.0% monocytes and 7% lymphocytes), Hb 119g/L and platelet counts 5,450x10 6 /L. The bone marrow (BM) was marked hypercellular with 0.9% blasts, 6.0% promyelocytes, 15.6% myelocytes, 8.1% immature eosinophils and 19.2% mature eosinophils. Karyotype of BM cells was 46, XX, t(12;13)(p13.1;q12.3\u201313)[28]/46, XX[2]. Under the suspicion of Ph-negative CML, she was treated with IFN\u03b1 with no response. Then, HU was started and her WBC decreased to 30x10 6 /L. FISH analysis showed that the breakpoint at 12p13 occurred within ETV6 , while the breakpoints at 13q12 occurred at two locations, within FLT3 or CDX2 . To identify the fusion partner of ETV6 , 3\u2032-RACE PCR was performed. Sequence analysis of PCR-products revealed 4 types of ETV6/FLT3 transcripts. These fusion transcripts were confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Each ETV6/FLT3 transcript contained the entire helix-loop-helix domain of ETV6 (exons 1 to 4 or 5) and almost all of the functional domains of FLT3 including the tyrosine kinase domain (from exons 14, 16 or 17), suggesting that the resultant chimeric protein would be constitutively activated FLT3 kinase. Of them, three are in-frame fusion, presumably encoding for the approximately 58, 62, and 83 kD fusion proteins. However, Western blot analysis showed only expression of the 58 and 83 kD proteins. RT-PCR detected the reciprocal FLT3/ETV6 transcript, comprising the FLT3 exons 1 to 13 frameshifly fused to the ETV6 exons 6 to 8, within which a stop codon appeared at codon 33- downstream from the fusion point. Functional studies to assess the oncogenic properties of these fusion proteins are now in progress. Our findings provide an evidence that FLT3 is also involved in hematologic malignancies as a fusion gene.",
