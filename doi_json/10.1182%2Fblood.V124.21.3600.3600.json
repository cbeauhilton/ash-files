    "abstract_text": "Wnt/\u00df-catenin signaling has been reported to be active in AML and essential for AML stem cells but not absolutely required for self-renewal of adult hematopoietic stem cells. Targeting \u00df-catenin may represent a novel therapeutic opportunity for AML that should be further investigated in clinical studies. Using reverse-phase protein array, we determined \u00df-catenin expression in samples obtained from 511 newly diagnosed AML patients and found that high \u00df-catenin level is associated with unfavorable cytogenetics (p = 0.01). Expression of \u00df-catenin is correlated with its target gene survivin in these samples (n= 511, R=0.24, p < 0.0001). In paired samples, \u00df-catenin expression is significantly higher in bone marrow (BM) than peripheral blood samples (n=140, p < 0.001) and in relapsed compared to newly diagnosed samples (n=47, p = 0.04). C-82, like ICG-001 is a \u00df-catenin/cAMP-response element-binding protein (CBP) modulator which binds to CBP and inhibits the interaction between \u00df-catenin and CBP thus disrupts Wnt/\u00df-catenin/CPB mediated cell proliferation/self-renewal signaling. In the present study, we investigated the effects of inhibition of \u00df-catenin/CBP by C-82 in AML cells on cell growth, cell survival, the expression of the downstream targets, and the therapeutic potential of C-82 in AML. Treatment with C-82 suppressed cell growth in AML cell lines. Cell cycle analysis showed that the treatment inhibited Edu incorporation and greatly decreased S-phase cells accompanied with increased G1 and subG1 cells in OCI-AML3 and Molm13 cells. Significant cell death was observed in C-82 treated OCI-AML3 and Molm13 cells (EC 50 =0.82\u00b10.04 \u03bcM and 0.79\u00b10.02 \u03bcM, IC 50 =0.42\u00b10.06 \u03bcM and 0.39\u00b10.02 \u03bcM, respectively) at 48 hours and cells from AML patients (n=7, EC 50 =1.90\u00b10.28 \u03bcM and IC 50 =1.17\u00b10.26 \u03bcM) including CD34 + 38 - AML stem/progenitor cells (n=6, EC 50 =4.25\u00b10.69 \u03bcM and IC 50 =2.11\u00b1 0.04 \u03bcM) at 72 hours, while minimal cell death was found in CD34 + cells from normal BM (n=3, <10% with 2.5 \u03bcM C-82 at 48 hours). Decreased expression of survivin, c-Myc, and CD44, all downstream of \u00df-catenin/CBP signaling were found in cell lines, bulk primary AML and CD34 + 38 - cells (n=7) by western blot or flow cytometry analysis. Co-cultures of AML cells with BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) induced \u00df-catenin and the adhesion protein CD44, a target of \u00df-catenin in AML cells suggesting that the BM microenvironment regulates \u00df-catenin expression in AML cells. This finding is supported by the observed higher \u00df-catenin levels in BM compared to peripheral blood cells. C-82 suppressed MSC-induced CD44, inhibited the adhesion of OCI-AML3 cells to MSCs, and induced apoptosis of AML cell lines and blasts (n=5) and CD34 + 38 - cells (n=4) from AML patients co-cultured with MSCs. Furthermore, combination of C-82 with Ara C further enhanced death of AML cells (combination index < 1). The data demonstrate that disrupting Wnt/\u00df-catenin signaling by a \u00df-catenin/CBP modulator C-82 suppresses cell growth and induces apoptosis in AML cells including CD34 + 38 - AML stem/progenitor cells while it has minimal toxicity in normal CD34 + cells supporting the clinical development of the strategy to test the therapeutic potential of targeting wnt/\u00df-catenin signaling in AML. PRI-724, a C-82 pro-drug is currently in clinical trial as a single agent and in combination with Ara C in patients with advanced AML. Disclosures Kouji: PRISM Pharma Co.: Employment.
