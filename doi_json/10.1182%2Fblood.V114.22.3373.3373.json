However, the role of such gene mutations for AML patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) was unclear and inconclusive. We retrospectively evaluated the prognostic impact of 8 gene mutations in adult AML patients undergoing allo-HSCT. Materials & Methods From 1995 to 2007, a total of 463 consecutive adult patients with de novo non-M3 AML had comprehensive gene mutation analyses at the National Taiwan University Hospital. Three hundred and twenty five patients who received conventional induction chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. Those who received only low dose chemotherapy or palliative treatment were excluded. The genetic alterations analyzed included NPM1, FLT3/ITD, FLT3/TKD, CEBPA, AML1/RUNX1, RAS, MLL/PTD, and WT1. The clinical implication of these genetic alterations in the patients receiving allo-HSCT was analyzed, and the result was compared with that in patients without allo-HSCT. Results The clinical characteristics in the patients receiving allo-HSCT (n=100) and those without (n=225) were similar with the exception of age, being younger in the former group (35.4 years vs. 49.5 years p 45 years), higher initial WBC count (WBC>50K/\u03bcL), elevated LDH level, unfavorable karyotype, FLT3/ITD , mutations of AML1/RUNX1 were significantly associated with poorer overall survival (OS) in patients not receiving allo-HSCT; While NPM1 mut /FLT3ITD neg and CEBPA mutations served as significantly good prognostic indicators. In multivariate analysis, age, WBC count, karyotype, FLT3/ITD , AML1/RUNX1 , CEBPA and NPM1 mut /FLT3ITD neg remained to be independent prognostic factors in non-allo-HSCT patients. However, in patients receiving allo-HSCT, only unfavorable karyotype and disease status (refractory or remission) at the time of transplantation were associated with poorer OS both in univariate and multivariate analyses. The similar prognostic impact of FLT3/ITD , CEBPA, AML1/RUNX1 and NPM1 on OS was not seen in patients receiving allo-HSCT. Furthermore, in contrast to its poor prognostic impact in non-allo-HSCT patients, mutation of AML1/RUNX1 was a significant good prognostic factor for relapse free survival (p=0.046), although not for OS, in allo-HSCT group. Conclusion FLT3/ITD , mutations of AML1/RUNX1 , CEBPA and NPM1 have great prognostic implication for OS in AML patients not receiving allo-HSCT. However, their impact on OS is ameliorated in patients receiving allo-HSCT. The results need to be confirmed by further studies on more patients.
