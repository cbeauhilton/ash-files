    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) represent a heterogeneous group of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas, derived from skin-homing mature T-cells. Mycosis fungoides (MF) and S\u00e9zary syndrome (SS) are the commonest types and together comprise 54% of all CTCL. MF evolves from patches to infiltrated plaques and eventually tumors. SS is a lymphoma-leukemia syndrome characterized by erythroderma and the presence of a malignant T-cell clone in the peripheral blood and the skin. At present, no curative treatment for CTCL is available. Therefore current CTCL research efforts are focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the disease\u2019s pathogenesis and on identifying new pharmacological targets. Several drugs have shown potentially significant activity either alone or in combination with conventional agents. Their effectiveness and their mechanisms of action comprise a current research challenge for the improvement of CTCL therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible alterations in the gene expression profile (focusing on DNA Damage Signaling and DNA Repair pathways) and cell death in CTCL cell lines after treatment with two chemotherapeutic agents, Bortezomib and Methotrexate. Methods: Three CTCL cell lines were used. MyLa, (MF), SeAx and Hut-78 (both SS). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 and were treated with either Bortezomib (10nmol/L) or Methotrexate (10\u03bcM) for 24h. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using the Annexin V/PI method. Gene expression profiling following PCR arrays analysis was performed after total RNA extraction and purification from untreated and drug-treated cells. All RNA samples\u2019 amplification, labeling and hybridization to RT 2 Profiler PCR Arrays (DNA Damage Signaling and DNA Repair PCR array) (QIAGEN) were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All data were analyzed using the appropriate RT 2 Profiler PCR Array data analysis tool. Results: Hut-78, Seax and Myla cells responded with statistically significant enhanced apoptosis when treated for 24h with bortezomib, compared to untreated cells, while Methotrexate led to a rather moderate increase of apoptosis in Hut-78 and Seax cells and did not affect the apoptosis of Myla cells. Microarrays analysis after bortezomib treatment revealed a great effect in the expression profile of genes involved in almost all DNA repair pathways tested, in all three cell lines, with Hut-78 being affected the most. Specifically, in all cell lines, there was a significant down-regulation of a large number of genes involved in the Double Strand Breaks DNA Repair mechanism, (i.e. BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD50, RAD51, RAD51C, XRCC2, XRCC3, XRCC4, XRCC5 and XRCC6) as well as of genes involved in the Mismatch Repair pathway (i.e. MLH1, MLH3, MSH2, MSH5, MSH6) and the Nucleotide Excision Repair mechanism (i.e. DDB2, LIG1 and RAD23A), compared to untreated cells. On the contrary, bortezomib had a small effect on Base Excision repair mechanism, mostly downregulating the expression of XRCC1 gene in Hut-78 and Myla cells. Methotrexate treatment also led to a significant down-regulation of genes involved in the DSB (RAD50, XRCC4, XRCC6), MMR (MSH4) and NER (CDK7, RAD23A) repair mechanisms in Hut-78 cells but had a rather much more moderate effect on the expression profile of Seax and Myla cells, where fewer genes were affected. Conclusions: Our data clearly demonstrate a differential effect of bortezomib and methotrexate in terms of apoptosis induction on CTCL cells with bortezomib inducing apoptosis of both MF and SS derived cell lines and methotrexate being rather inactive on SS derived cells. We showed that both drugs, but mostly bortezomib significantly down-regulate a large number of genes involved in the DSB, MMR and NER mechanisms, suggesting a possible mechanism, among probably others, for the enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis of SS and MF cell lines after treatment. Bortezomib\u2019s significant effect could be easily understood, since it is a well known proteasome inhibitor and has been previously related to inhibition of NF-kB and accumulation of pro-apoptotic proteins, while it has also been reported that cancer cells are more sensitive to proteasome inhibition than normal cells. Although these results need to be further confirmed, they appear very encouraging for understanding the mechanisms of action of these drugs in CTCL with the view to ameliorate their use in clinical practice.
