    "abstract_text": "Background Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare low-grade B-cell malignancy characterized by the infiltration of IgM-secreting lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow. There is no standard therapy for WM, but several drugs have been shown to be effective either alone or in combination. Bendamustine (B)-Rituximab (R) has been found to be effective in salvage (Tedeschi , Leukemia Lymphoma 2015) or first setting in MW (Treon, ASH2016). BR- regimen has however reported to be associated with an increase in secondary cancer and the development of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) in patients with previously treated non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Prolonged neutropenia after R-chemotherapy treatment of lymphoma or CLL has also been associated with an increase of MDS/AML, and a shorter interval between the occurrence of the two malignancies. However, this has not been evaluated in previously untreated WM, nor the possible relationship with secondary cytopenia to WM treatment. Methods Forty-four symptomatic previously untreated patients with WM based on the second WM Workshop recommendations for diagnostic criteria were enrolled in this retrospective multi-center study between January 2012 and January 2017 in ten French centers. MYD88L265P and CXCR4 mutations were searched using q PCR and or next generation sequencing. Del (17) p and/ or TP53 mutation were investigated for 22 patients. All patients received a BR regimen consisting of 375 mg/m2 of rituximab on day 1 and 90 mg/m 2 of bendamustine on days 1 and 2, repeated every 4 weeks, with a maximum of 6 cycles. Long-term complications of BR, 6 months or more after treatment discontinuation were analyzed. PFS and OS were plotted using the log rank test and Kaplan-Meier comparison. Results The median age at WM diagnosis was 69 years old (range 45-88) and the median age at initiation of therapy was 70 years old (range 46-89). The MYD88L265Pmutation was present in 24/30 (80%) of the cases. CXCR4 mutations were observed in 2/14 cases, alteration of TP53 in 1/22 cases. The median time from diagnosis to therapy was 2 months (range 0-123 months). The median serum IgM level was 3,870mg/dl (range 650-12000). The criteria for initiating BR treatment were: anemia (54%), B-symptoms (45%), hyper viscosity (25%), adenopathy and/or splenomegaly (18%), thrombocytopenia (16%), neuropathy (11%), and amyloidosis (4%). According to the IPSSMW score, 22% of patients were low risk, 35% intermediate risk, and 43% high risk. Overall 82% of patients completed the planned 6 courses. Using consensus response criteria, the ORR was 95% (CR15%, VGPR 40% PR38% MR 2%) and the major response rate (CR+VGPR+PR) 93%. Toxicities attributed to BR led to dose reduction and/ or incomplete regimen of intended therapy in 18% of patients. Their median age was 78 years old. Toxicities were related to excessive or prolonged myelosuppression in 5 patients and infection in 3. Most of the adverse events were hematological and infectious toxic effects. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 4 (11%) cases and grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia in one (3%). Minor infections developed in eight cases: three cutaneous infections, two herpes zosters, one upper respiratory tract infection, one sinusitis, and one oral-herpes. Grade 3-4 pneumonia was observed in two cases and sepsis in one. Among 38 evaluable patients for toxicities after BR therapy, 16(42%) developed one or more long-lasting cytopenias: neutropenia (34%), anemia (10%), and thrombocytopenia (8%), all grade I and II. The median duration for prolonged neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were 6 months (range: 6-24 months), 7.5 months (range: 6-9 months) and 12 months (6-30 months), respectively. After a median observation time of 27 months (range 5-51 months) after BR-regimen, the PFS and OS were 92% and 100%, respectively. Two patients relapsed at 24 and 45 months. One patient with a history of breast cancer prior to WM treatment relapsed from this solid tumor at 23 months. None of the patients developed aggressive lymphoma or secondary MDS/AML at the last follow-up. Conclusion The BR regimen is efficient in patients with previously untreated WM. In elderly patients, the dose of bendamustine needs to be lowered. Long-lasting cytopenia occurred in half of patients and resolved in most cases within one year after the end of treatment. Longer follow-up is needed to assess the long-term risks of BR treatment.
