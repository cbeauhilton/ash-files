    "abstract_text": "Background : B-Chronic Lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in North America. The standard current treatments use purine nucleoside analogues as single agent therapy or in combination with rituximab, steroids, and alkylating agents. Overall response rates with these treatments in previously untreated patients may reach 90 % with CR rates of 50\u201360%, however, most patients will relapse. Thus, despite refinements in therapy, CLL remains an incurable malignancy and there remains significant and urgent need to identify and develop new agents with novel mechanisms of action for the treatment of CLL. In line with this we have explored the mechanism and in vitro activity for a tyrphostin, adaphostin. Methods: We evaluated the in vitro efficacy of adaphostin to induce apoptosis in CLL B-cells. Peripheral blood was collected from patients with CLL (n=57). Highly purified CLL B-cells ((minimum 80% CD19+, mean 92.2% CD19+ and 94.4% CD19+/CD5+ positive)) were cultured with freshly prepared adaphostin for 24 \u2013 120 hours. Cell death was analyzed by flow cytometry using Anexin V/Propidium iodide (PI). PARP cleavage and anti-apoptotic protein levels were measured by immunoblot techniques. The effect of combination treatment on CLL B cells with adaphostin and fludarabine on CLL B-cells was also assessed. Results: Analysis by Annexin V/PI staining revealed that the mean IC 50 for adaphostin at 24 h was 4.2 uM (range 1.10 uM-11.25 uM; median = 4.25; n = 29) for CLL isolates and >10 uM for B and T-cells isolated from normal donors. Median IC 50 levels for Adaphostin were not significantly different based on IgV H mutation status, level of CD38 expression, or cytogenetic abnormalities by FISH testing (Table 1). Immunoblots demonstrated adaphostin-induced PARP cleavage and cleavage of caspase 3 substrates, suggesting that adaphostin induces cell death through apoptosis. Adaphostin increased the intra-cellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CLL B-cells; and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine blocked both adaphostin-induced ROS generation and apoptosis (mean reduction cell death=60%; range 23\u201399% reduction) suggesting generation of ROS is critical to adaphostin\u2019s induction of apoptosis. Adaphostin also caused a decrease in the level of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 in a majority of patients on both flow cytometry and immunoblots. When adaphostin was combined with fludarabine (F-ARA-ATP), a synergistic effect on cell death was observed in all 10 CLL samples when analyzed by mathematical modeling software. Summary: These findings indicate that adaphostin induces selective apoptosis in CLL B-cells from all risk categories through a mechanism that involves ROS generation. Importantly, we also demonstrate its ability to augment the effects of fludarabine. We continue to explore the preclinical development of adaphostin as a novel agent for the treatment of CLL.
