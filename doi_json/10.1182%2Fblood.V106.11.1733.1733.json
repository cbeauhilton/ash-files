    "abstract_text": "The basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factor SCL is required for specification of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and for differentiation of the megakaryocytic and erythroid lineages. bHLH proteins bind DNA as dimers and this has been thought to be a prerequisite for their function. We challenged this concept by showing that SCL DNA-binding activity was dispensable for some of its functions using SCL\u2212/\u2212 ES cells rescued with a DNA-binding defective SCL mutant (SCL-RER) (Porcher et al. Development,1999). We have now studied the in vivo requirements for SCL DNA-binding activity in mice with a germ line SCL-RER mutation. In contrast to SCL knock-out embryos that die at E9.5 from absence of haematopoietic development, specification of primitive erythroid progenitors was observed in SCL RER/RER mutant yolk sacs. At day E12.5 and E13.5, homozygote mutant SCL RER/RER embryos were smaller and paler than wild-type (wt) and heterozygote littermates but presented at the expected mendelian frequency. Lethality was first observed at day E14.5. However, 7% of homozygote mice were born from heterozygous crosses. Surviving adult mice presented with mild microcytic hypochromic anemia. Assessment of progenitor replating potential showed qualitative defects with poor haemoglobinisation of homozygote-derived fetal and adult CFU-Es compared to controls. To understand the cause of the phenotype, expression levels of candidate target genes were assessed in fetal liver cells enriched for either early progenitors or late normoblasts. We observed decreased or increased mRNA expression of most genes tested in mutant-derived erythroid populations when compared to controls matched for differentiation stage, thereby showing that SCL DNA-binding activities are required for both activation and repression of target genes. As examples, mRNA for red cell membrane protein Band 4.2 was dramatically decreased; in contrast, alpha-globin expression was up-regulated in early progenitors, indicating that SCL DNA-binding activity might be required for repression of alpha-globin levels in this setting. We then pursued the analysis of SCL-mediated alpha-globin gene regulation by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis and tested 4 DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) previously shown to bind SCL. From material derived from mutant fetal liver cells, we observed slight variations of SCL binding on 3 out of the 4 cis-acting elements when compared to controls. Importantly, there was a dramatic decrease in SCL binding on the fourth DHS site (HS-12). We concluded that SCL DNA-binding activity was likely to be directly required for repression of alpha-globin levels in erythroid progenitors. Interestingly, we have recently characterised the interaction of SCL with a co-repressor complex comprising the oncoprotein ETO-2 in erythroid cells. We have now shown by ChIP that ETO-2 occupies the alpha-globin locus on HS-12 in wt erythroid progenitors, but not in more mature cells, therefore suggesting a role for the SCL/ETO-2 complex in repression of erythroid-specific genes in the early stages of erythroid maturation. In conclusion, this in vivo model confirms the dispensability of SCL DNA-binding activity for specification of HSCs and allows characterisation of DNA-binding requirements throughout development. Combined with studies of the dynamic of SCL-containing multiprotein complexes during erythroid maturation, this model will help define the molecular pathways involved in erythropoiesis."
