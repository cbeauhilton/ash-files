    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2856 Poster Board II-832 BACKGROUND. Molecular profiling of multiple myeloma allows the identification of novel targets, including HIF1A, and evaluation of their expression within large cohorts of patients. We report here the expression of HIF1A in myeloma and for the first time the preclinical testing of 4 members of a novel class of sulfonanilide HIF1A signaling inhibitors. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Expression of HIF1A was assessed using Affymetrix DNA-microarrays in 329 samples of CD138-purified myeloma cells from previously untreated patients. Chromosomal aberrations were assessed by comprehensive iFISH using a set of probes for the chromosomal regions 1q21, 6q21, 8p21, 9q34, 11q23, 11q13, 13q14.3, 14q32, 15q22, 17p13, 19q13, 22q11, as well as the translocations t(4;14)(p16.3;q32.3) and t(11;14)(q13;q32.3). Proliferation of primary myeloma cells (n=67) was determined by propidium iodine staining. The effect of the novel HIF1A signaling inhibitors ELR510490, ELR510454, ELR510444 and ELR105813 on the proliferation of 12 human myeloma cell lines and the first three on the survival of 5 primary myeloma cell-samples cultured within their microenvironment was tested, and their ability to inhibit HIF1A signaling was examined using a cell-based reporter assay. Studies were also conducted to determine in vitro stability (in plasma and microsomes), as well as single-dose PK (SDPK) parameters and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) levels after dosing in mice. RESULTS. We found (i) HIF1A to be expressed by 95.4% of CD138-purified primary myeloma cell samples from previously untreated patients. (ii) HIF1A expression shows a weak but significant correlation (r=0.3, p<0.001) with a gene expression based proliferation index. (iii) Of the chromosomal aberrations tested, myeloma cells of patients with presence of a translocation t(4,14) show a significantly higher expression of HIF1A (p<0.001) vs. patients without. Myeloma cells of hyperdiploid patients show a significantly lower expression of HIF1A (p=0.02) vs. non hyperdiploid patients. (iii) HIF1A expression does not show a correlation with event-free or overall survival. (iv) The sulfonanilides ELR510490, ELR510444, ELR510454 and ELR105813 completely inhibit proliferation of all tested myeloma cell lines at nM concentrations. (v) The compounds tested, i.e. ELR510490, ELR510444, ELR510454, are active on all primary myeloma cell-samples tested. (vi) The compounds show a pronounced effect on the HIF1A signaling pathway at EC 50 s of 1-25nM. (vii) Pre-clinical pharmacology data for the compounds ELR510444 and ELR510490 in mice indicate favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profiles as well as exposure levels upon dosing at well-tolerated levels that are significantly above the in vitro EC 50 in all the cell lines tested. CONCLUSION. HIF1A is expressed in almost all primary myeloma cells. The novel HIF1A signaling inhibitors tested are very active on myeloma cell lines as well as primary myeloma cells and show favorable in vivo profiles with exposure levels in mice significantly higher than the concentrations required for the inhibition of cell proliferation or apoptosis induction in vitro . This class of compounds thus represents a promising weapon in the therapeutic arsenal against multiple myeloma. Disclosures: Rebacz: ELARA Pharmaceuticals: Employment.
