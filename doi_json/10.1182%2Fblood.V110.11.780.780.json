    "abstract_text": "AML is characterized by the clonal expansion of immature myeloblasts initiating from rare leukemic stem cells (LSCs). We developed a primary human AML xenotransplantation model using newborn NOD/SCID/IL2rg\u2212/ \u2212 mice. From 9 patients, 4x10 6 T cell-depleted BMMNCs were injected iv into sublethally irradiated recipients. At 3 months, newborn NOD/SCID/IL2rg\u2212/ \u2212 recipients demonstrated superior engraftment efficiency compared with adult NOD/SCID/IL2rg\u2212/ \u2212 and newborn NOD/SCID/b2m\u2212/ \u2212 recipients (37.8%, 11.9%, 12.9%, respectively; p<0.005). When sorted primary AML hCD34+CD38\u2212 cells from 6 patients were injected iv, as few as 10 3 cells engrafted dose-dependently. Transplanted hCD34+hCD38\u2212 cells gave rise to hCD34+hCD38\u2212, hCD34+hCD38+ and hCD34\u2212 cells. In serial transplantation, injection of 10 3 purified hCD34+hCD38\u2212 cells resulted in long-term engraftment, giving rise to hCD34+hCD38\u2212 LSCs and hCD34+hCD38+/hCD34\u2212 blasts, demonstrating self-renewal and differentiation capacities of primary LSCs in vivo. We next examined homing and localization of LSCs using this model. In recipient femoral sections, 94.0% and 78.4% of hCD34+ cells were found in the endosteal region at day 3 and at 4 months after iv injection, respectively (10,065 cells and 24,973 cells examined, respectively; p<0.001 for each), demonstrating that human primary LSCs preferentially home to and engraft in the BM endosteal region. Dual FISH analysis using mouse and human pan-centromeric probes confirmed the human origin of these cells. When AML-engrafted mice were treated with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) to examine the effect of anti-leukemia drugs in vivo, PB AML burden became markedly reduced by day 8, followed by AML relapse by days 16\u201328. Apoptosis analysis of day 3-post-Ara-C BM demonstrated that hCD34+hCD38\u2212 LSCs are more resistant to Ara-C induced apoptosis compared to hCD34+hCD38+ and hCD34\u2212 cells (Annexin V-7AAD-: 77.1%, 33.3%, 27.5% respectively; n=3 for each; p<0.05 for each). TUNEL staining using day 3 post-Ara-C femoral sections demonstrated that TUNEL-negative cells were preferentially located at the endosteal surface while the cells in the central BM cavity were apoptotic. The cells abutting the endosteum were hCD34+hCD38\u2212 and were adjacent to osteopontin+ osteoblasts. % of cells in the G0 phase of cell cycle was significantly greater in the hCD34+hCD38\u2212 compared with the hCD34+hCD38+ and hCD34\u2212 fractions (n=5 for each; p<0.005 for each), suggesting a potential mechanism underlying relative chemo-resiatance of LSCs. In summary, primary human LSCs preferentially engraft in the BM endosteal areas where they are protected from AraC-induced apoptosis. Cell cycle quiescence of LSCs may be one of the mechanisms underlying chemoresistance of LSCs.",
