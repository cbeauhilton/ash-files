    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2197 Hemophilia B is characterized by structural and functional defects in coagulation factor IX (FIX) caused by mutations in the F9 gene. Various mutations (nonsense, missense, etc.) are known to be associated with the disease, including a synonymous V107V mutation reported recently by Knobe and colleagues (Knobe et al., Hemophilia, 2008). However the mechanism by which this synonymous mutation contributes to the disease has not yet been elucidated. Earlier we have shown that synonymous codon substitutions in the mRNA of the multidrug resistance protein (MDR1) may change the conformation of the protein and result in altered functionality (Kimchi-Sarfaty et al. , Science, 2008). Here we have performed in silico analyses of the synonymous codon substitution (GTGa\u0300GTA) leading to the V107V polymorphism and found that it may change the mRNA structure, stability, codon usage, and 3D structure of the encoded protein. We hypothesize that changes in codon usage might affect the rhythm of protein translation and thus result in slightly altered FIX conformation. In vitro analyses of FIX mRNA and protein expression supported our in silico analyses. The GTGa\u0300GTA (V107V) synonymous mutation results in reduced expression levels as well as an encoded protein with a slightly different conformation compared to wild-type FIX. These results show that the V107V polymorphism is not silent and might cause mild hemophilia B. This work sheds further light on ways in which synonymous mutations impact disease.
