    "abstract_text": "Introduction. B cell-activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), a BAFF-related molecule, play a key role in the survival and proliferation of mature B cells. In addition, BAFF and APRIL cooperate with IL-4 to induce class switch DNA recombination (CSR) from IgM (or IgG) to IgG, IgA or IgE. This process requires activation-induced-cytidine deaminase (AID), a DNA-editing enzyme involved also in Ig somatic hypermutation and lymphomagenesis. BAFF and APRIL are usually produced by myeloid cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages and granulocytes, and engage three receptors preferentially expressed on B cells, including transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophylin ligand interactor (TACI), B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), and BAFF receptor (BAFF-R). Our previous studies show that BAFF and APRIL are EBV-inducible molecules implicated in B cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL). The scope of the present studies was to elucidate the expression and function of BAFF, APRIL, TACI, BCMA and BAFF-R in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Methods. Tissue sections from 5 primary EBV + HL cases and 5 primary EBV \u2212 HL cases were analyzed for BAFF, APRIL, TACI, BCMA, and BAFF-R expression through immunohistochemistry. RS cells from 6 primary cases were microdissected and analyzed for the expression of AID and CSR byproducts by RT-PCR. The expression of BAFF, APRIL, TACI, BCMA, BAFF-R, AID, and CSR byproducts was also analyzed in 5 HL cell lines cultured in the presence or absence of recombinant BAFF, APRIL and cytokines as previously described 1 , 2 , 3 . Results. We found that the reactive infiltrate of primary HL tumors comprises non-malignant elements, such as macrophages, granulocytes and plasma cells, expressing BAFF and APRIL. Also a variable proportion of malignant CD30 + Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells from both EBV + and EBV \u2212 HL cases express BAFF and APRIL. Unlike NHL B cells, which usually express BAFF-R, primary RS cells and RS cell lines lack BAFF-R, but express TACI and BCMA. In the presence of BAFF or APRIL, RS cell lines are rescued from spontaneous or induced apoptosis. This effect is associated with activation of NF-\u03baB through a classical pathway. Increased RS cell survival is also associated with up-regulation of the pro-survival BCL-2 and BCL-XL proteins, and down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic BAX protein. Finally, in the presence of BAFF or APRIL and IL-4, RS cell lines up-regulate AID expression and increase their spontaneous CSR activity. Of note, AID expression extends to primary RS cells and is associated with ongoing CSR. Conclusions. Our studies indicate that BAFF and APRIL stimulate malignant RS cells through both autocrine and paracrine pathways. Engagement of TACI and BCMA receptors by BAFF and APRIL may enhance the expansion of RS cells by attenuating apoptosis through a mechanism involving NF-\u03baB and BCL family proteins. By up-regulating AID, signals emanating from TACI and BCMA receptors might also introduce genomic instability. Finally, considering that TACI, BCMA and AID are B cell-specific molecules and that CSR is a process confined to B cells, our findings consolidate the notion that RS cells derive from a B cell precursor.",
