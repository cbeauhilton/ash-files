    "abstract_text": "Background: Dose-modified chemotherapy for AR-NHL in the pre-HAART era has been shown to be equally efficacious and less myelotoxic [ N Engl J Med  1997 ; 336 : 1641 (mBACOD) ; J Clin Oncol  2001 ; 19 : 2171 (mCHOP) ]. In resource-constrained settings, intravenous chemotherapy and supportive care of the AIDS / cancer patient are challenging ( J Natl Cancer Inst  2002 ; 94 : 718 ). Methods: We embarked on a pilot feasibility trial of dose-modified oral chemotherapy [lomustine 50 mg/m2 D1 (C#1 only); VP-16 100 mg/m2 D1\u20133; and cyclophosphamide / procarbazine 50 mg/m2 each D22\u201326 at 6-week intervals (1 cycle) for 2 cycles] in HIV-infected patients with biopsy-proven AR-NHL in East Africa. Results: A total of 49 pts (21 Uganda; 28 Kenya) were treated on study. The majority of pts were female (59%) with median age 39 yrs (range 18\u201364); poor PS (2 or 3) \u2212 63%; high grade lymphoma (69%); advanced stage (III or IV) \u2212 69%; and B symptoms (79%). At study entry median CD4 count was 200/\u03bcL and HIV-1 viral load 97,973 copies/ml. Eighteen pts (36%) had access to ARV. A total of 78 cycles of therapy were administered to 49 pts (median 2; range 0.5\u20132). The regimen was well tolerated. There were 4 episodes of febrile neutropenia and 3 treatment-related deaths (6% mortality rate). Overall objective response rate is 77% (CR/uCR 56%); median survival 12.3 months; and 18 patients remain alive as of 7/11/06. Conclusions: Dose-modified oral chemotherapy is efficacious, has comparable outcome to that in the US in pre-HAART era, an acceptable safety profile, and is pragmatic in the resource-limited setting. Further investigation of the oral regimen vs. mCHOP is warranted.",
