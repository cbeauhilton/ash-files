    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2210 Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a key regulator of factor X (FX) activation in the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. TFPI inhibits FXa generation by formation of a quaternary complex consisting of factor VIIa (FVIIa), tissue factor (TF), FXa and TFPI. The main portion (\u223c80%) of TFPI in humans is reportedly associated with endothelial cells. We used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a model to obtain further insight into the function of TFPI\u03b1 and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored TFPI form, which represents TFPI\u03b1 bound to GPI-anchored surface proteins and/or TFPI\u03b2. In contrast to TFPI\u03b1, which consists of 3 Kunitz domains (KD) and a basic C-terminal part, GPI-anchored TFPI\u03b2 lacks the third Kunitz domain (KD3) and the basic C\u2013terminal region due to alternative splicing. In TFPI\u03b2 these two domains are replaced by a sequence that adds a GPI anchor to the protein linking it to the cell membrane. Treatment of HUVECs with phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PI-PLC) that cleaves GPI-anchors and subsequent fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) on living cells showed that GPI-anchored TFPI represents about 70\u201380% of cell surface TFPI. Staining of TFPI on and in fixed and permeabilized cells (total TFPI) demonstrated that GPI-anchored cell surface TFPI contributes to \u223c20% of total cellular TFPI. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that PI-PLC treatment released a TFPI protein lacking the KD3 and basic C-terminus. These findings strongly suggest that TFPI\u03b2 is the predominant GPI-anchored form of TFPI on HUVECs. FX activation assays performed on the cell surface of PI-PLC treated living HUVECs showed the importance of GPI-anchored TFPI on extrinsic Xase complex activity. PI-PLC treatment resulted in increased FX activation. Although GPI-anchored TFPI displays \u223c70\u201380% of cell surface TFPI, overall FXa generation was increased only by \u223c50%. In conclusion, HUVEC surface TFPI is predominantly TFPI\u03b2, and GPI-anchored TFPI is the main but not sole regulator of FX activation on the surface of HUVECs.
