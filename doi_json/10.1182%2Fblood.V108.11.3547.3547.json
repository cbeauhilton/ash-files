    "abstract_text": "Lenalidomide is a novel, orally administered immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) that has single-agent activity against multiple myeloma (MM) and additive effects when combined with dexamethasone. We have previously reported improved response (OR), time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) with lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Len-Dex) compared to dexamethasone-placebo (Dex) based on the results of 2 phase III trials (MM-009, North American, 353 pts; MM-010, Europe, Australia, and Israel, 351 pts). In both trials patients with relapsed or refractory MM not resistant to dexamethasone, were treated with dexamethasone 40 mg daily on days 1\u20134, 9\u201312, and 17\u201320 every 28 days and were randomized to receive either lenalidomide 25 mg daily orally on days 1\u201321 every 28 days or placebo. Beginning at cycle 5, Dex was reduced to 40 mg daily on days 1\u20134 only, every 28 days. Patients were also stratified with respect to B 2 M (\u22642.5 vs. > 2.5 mg/mL), prior stem cell transplant (none vs. \u2265 1), and number of prior regimens (1 vs > 1). At a median follow-up from randomization of 17.1 mos (MM-009) and 16.5 mos (MM-010), both studies continue to show significant improvement with Len-Dex compared to Dex in OR (MM-009: 61% vs 20.5%, p 68.1 wks) compared to only 22/76 pts (28.9%) treated with dexamethasone alone (med. duration of response 22.1 wks, p30ml/min, but still significantly higher than for pts treated with Dex. Grade 3\u20134 thrombocytopenia was significantly higher in pts with impaired renal function (50ml/min 4.6%, p30 ml/min, 5.5%, p<.05), but there was no difference for G3\u20134 neutropenia at either cutoff. Phase I\u2013II evaluation to establish appropriate dosing in pts with cr cl < 30ml/min, particularly with respect to thrombocytopenia is warranted, but should not underscore improved OR, TTP, and OS for pts treated with Len-Dex regardless of creatinine clearance."
