    "abstract_text": "Stromal cells are essential components of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment regulating and supporting the survival of different tumors, including B-cell acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL and CLL), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we investigated the role of Notch signalling in human BM-mesenchymal stromal cell (hBM-MSC)-promoted ALL, CLL and AML survival and chemoresistance. The block of Notch signalling through \u03b3-secretase inhibitor (GSI) XII reverted the protective effect mediated by co-culture with BM-MSC. The treatment with combinations of anti-Notch neutralizing Abs resulted in the decrease of B-ALL cell survival, either cultured alone or cocultured in presence of BM-MSC from normal donors and B-ALL patients. The inhibition of Notch-3 and -4 or Jagged-1/-2 and DLL-1 resulted in a dramatic increase of apoptotic B-ALL cells by 3 days, similar to what is obtained by blocking all Notch signaling with the GSI XII. The same Notch receptors are involved in CLL survival except for Notch-1 that, in CLL, mediates a synergistic effect with other Notch receptors in inducing the anti-apoptotic phenotype. Some preliminary data showed that Notch system is involved in survival and chemoresistance of acute myeloid leukemia blasts. Overall, our \ufb01ndings show that stromal cell-mediated Notch signaling has a role in promoting ALL, CLL and AML survival and resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, the target of Notch pathway activation may represent a useful strategy to overcome drug resistance and improve the efficacy of conventional treatments.
