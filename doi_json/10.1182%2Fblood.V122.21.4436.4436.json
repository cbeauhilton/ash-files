    "abstract_text": "In multiple myeloma (MM) the interaction of plasma cells, bone marrow stromal cells and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) plays a significant role in conferring resistance to therapy and in the maintenance of residual disease. Folate receptors (FR) are specifically expressed on metabolically active malignant cells and TAMs and their expression in normal tissues and resting macrophages is limited. FR mediates folate uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis. This qualifies the receptor to be exploited for drug delivery of folate conjugated cancer therapeutics. Our primary goal in this study is to evaluate the expression of functional FR in MM cells and TAMs with a view to exploit this for folate conjugated targeted therapy for MM. First we evaluated the presence of TAMs in paraffin embedded bone marrow slides of newly diagnosed MM patients with CD68 (pan-Macrophage marker) and CD163 antibodies (specific marker of TAMs) and found extensive infiltration of macrophages in bone marrow from MM patients. Next to evaluate expression of FR in MM cells, we employed an FR antibody and evaluated MM cell lines with immunoblot, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. In a panel of ten MM cell lines, we found that out of the three FR isoforms (\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3), FR beta (FR-\u03b2) is expressed by all of them. Next to test whether this expressed receptor is indeed functional, we incubated the cells with folate deficient media, added different concentrations of EC17 (folate conjugated to FITC, Endocyte Inc.) to the medium and looked for the uptake by flow cytometry after washing off the drug at different time points (after 10, 20, 40 and 60 min).We observed that the uptake begins in 10 min and is saturated at 1 hour with 100nM Folate-FITC. With confocal imaging, Folate-FITC was found in the cytoplasm of MM cells suggesting internalization of Folate-FITC and localization in the cytoplasm. In addition to myeloma cell lines, we also confirmed the uptake of Folate-FITC in CD138+ plasma cells of a newly diagnosed myeloma patient by flow cytometry. This strongly suggests that MM cells express functional FR-\u03b2. To test the specificity of this FR mediated uptake, we pre-incubated cells with 0.1mM folic acid in medium for 30 min and then added EC17. This maneuver blocked the activity mediated by FR and no uptake was observed , which proves that the Folate-FITC is internalized only through the FR. To evaluate the expression of FR in-vivo samples, we stained paraffin embedded bone marrow slides of newly diagnosed MM patients with FR-\u03b2 antibody and TAM specific markers. We observe that FR is expressed on both MM cells as well as TAMs. To assess the endurance of cytotoxic effect of folate conjugated chemotherapeutic agents, we treated MM cell lines with folate conjugated vinka alkaloids and compared them to unconjugated drug and found no significant difference in their action suggesting conjugation with folate does not alter its efficacy. To assess potential toxicity of folate conjugated therapeutics, we obtained CD34+ cells and looked for the uptake of Folate-FITC with flow cytometry. We found no uptake and this is in line with previous reports suggesting that CD34 positive cells express nonfunctional FR. So we propose that FR qualify as potential targets for cancer treatment. Folate targeted therapy using folate-conjugated drugs which can selectively act against both MM cells and supporting TAMs has the potential of specific anti-MM tumoricidal activity. This therapeutic approach would broaden the use of drugs that could be conjugated with folate for MM therapy. Additionally assessment of TAMs in bone marrow sections of MM patients would add another feature for grading, classifying and prognosticating MM.
