    "abstract_text": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells expressing B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) can target and kill multiple myeloma (MM). BCMA was chosen as a target for MM because it is expressed by almost all cases of MM but has a restricted expression pattern on normal cells. CAR antigen-recognition domains made up of monoclonal antibody-derived, single-chain-variable fragments (scFv) are potentially immunogenic. To reduce the risk of recipient immune responses against CAR T cells, we used the sequence of a novel anti-BCMA, fully-human, heavy-chain-only binding domain designated FHVH33. The FHVH33 binding domain sequence was from TeneoBio, Inc. FHVH33 is smaller than a scFv. FHVH33 lacks the light chain, artificial linker sequence, and 2 associated junctions of a scFv, so it is predicted to be less immunogenic than a scFv, especially murine-derived scFvs. We constructed a CAR incorporating FHVH33, CD8\u03b1 hinge and transmembrane domains, a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, and a CD3\u03b6 T-cell activation domain. The CAR, FHVH33-CD8BBZ, is encoded by a \u03b3-retroviral vector. FHVH33-CD8BBZ-expressing T cells (FHVH-BCMA-T) exhibited a full range of T-cell functions in vitro and eliminated tumors and disseminated malignancy in mice (Lam et al, Blood (ASH abstract) 2017 vol 130: 504 ) . We are conducting the first clinical trial of FHVH-BCMA-T. Patients receive conditioning chemotherapy on days -5 to -3 with 300 mg/m 2 of cyclophosphamide and 30 mg/m 2 of fludarabine followed by infusion of FHVH-BCMA-T on day 0. This dose-escalation trial has 5 planned dose levels (DL). Twelve patients have received FHVH-BCMA-T on 3 DLs, 0.75x10 6 , 1.5x10 6 and 3x10 6 CAR + T cells/kg of bodyweight. Three patients were enrolled on the trial but not treated. The median age of patients enrolled was 63 (range 52-70); patients received a median of 6 lines of anti-myeloma therapy (range 3-10) prior to treatment with FHVH-BCMA-T. Ten patients out of 12 patients have achieved objective responses (OR). Five patients have obtained CRs or VGPRs to date. One patient achieved a partial remission (PR) 26 weeks after FHVH-BCMA-T infusion through a continued decrease in a measurable plasmacytoma. Five out of 7 patients who had myeloma with high-risk cytogenetics had an OR (Table). ORs occurred in patients with large soft-tissue plasmacytomas. Loss of BCMA expression on myeloma cells after treatment was documented in 2 patients. Two patients who developed progressive MM after CAR T-cell infusion had evidence of minimal residual disease in bone marrow 1-2 months post infusion of CAR T cells (patients 7,8). Eleven out of 12 patients had cytokine release syndrome (CRS); CRS grades ranged from 1-3 (Lee et al. Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 25 (2019) 625-638). The median peak C reactive protein (CRP) of the patients with CRS was 156.3 mg/L. Of 12 patients, 1 received the interleukin-6-receptor antagonist tocilizumab on day +6 to treat grade 3 CRS with hypotension requiring low-dose pressor therapy, grade 2 ejection fraction (EF) decrease and elevation of creatinine kinase (CK). All parameters returned to baseline by day +10. Patient 12 had a grade 3 decrease in EF which resolved by day +29. Two patients had grade 2 neurotoxicity that resolved without intervention: patient 3 had headaches, dysarthria and word-finding difficulties that resolved after 6 days while patient 6 had headaches on day +4. Patient 12 had grade 3 neurotoxicity with confusion on day +2; she was given dexamethasone with improvement in mental status the same day. After attaining a response, patient 6 died from influenza complications 6 weeks after FHVH-BCMA-T infusion. A median of 10.6% (range 1.1-46) of bone marrow T cells were CAR + when assessed 14 days after FHVH-BCMA-T infusion. We assessed blood CAR + cells by quantitative PCR. The median peak level of CAR + cells was 76.5 cells/\u00b5l (range 3-347 cells/\u00b5l) and the median day post-infusion of peak blood CAR + cell levels was 13 (range 9-14). The results from this phase 1 trial demonstrate that FHVH-BCMA-T cells can induce responses at low dose levels. Patients who had no CRS or low-grade CRS achieved objective responses. Toxicity was limited and reversible. Accrual to this trial continues. A maximum tolerated dose has not been determined yet. These results encourage further development of FHVH CAR-T.
