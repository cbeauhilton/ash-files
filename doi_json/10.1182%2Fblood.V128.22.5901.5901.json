    "abstract_text": "Objective: To investigate the effect and mechanisms of KPT-330 on cell apoptosis of human leukemia cells. Methods: CCK-8 assay was used to quantify the growth inhibition of cells after exposure to KPT-330 for 24 hours. Fluorescence microscope was used to observe the morphological change of leukemia cell when treated with KPT330 for 24 hours. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometric analysis was used to detect apoptosis of leukemia cells. Then Western blot was used to detect the expression level of CRM1 and the activation of apoptosis related protein Caspase-9\u3001Caspase-3 and PARP level. LncRNA microarray was used to analyze the differentially expressed genes from the cluster analyses. Results: The inhibition of cell proliferation of leukemia cells was in a dose-dependent manner and KPT-330 treatment induced expression of CRM1 down-regulated .Abnormal cells were observed under fluorescence microscopy. Cell apoptosis, cell cycle and activation of apoptosis markers demonstrates that KPT-330 induced apoptosis in leukemia cells. LncRNA microarray analysis showed differently expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in KPT-330 treated HL-60 cells compared with control group. Molecular function analysis showed that KPT-330 induced apoptosis in leukemia cells partially related with Glutathione metabolism and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Conclusion: In this study, KPT-330 treatment resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in leukemia cells. LncRNA microarray analysis showed differentially expressed genes and lncRNAs in KPT-330 treated HL-60 cells and we demonstrated that KPT-330 induced apoptosis in leukemia cells partially related with Glutathione metabolism and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. These results may provide new clue about molecular mechanism of KPT-330 induced apoptosis; however, underlying details will be required to determine further. Taken together, our findings suggest that for the first time that KPT-330 may act as new candidate's drug for leukemia. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
