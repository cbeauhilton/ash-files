    "abstract_text": "Abstract Tumor specific or related antigen cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) have been identified in chronic myeloid leukemia patients, however, whether they are constituted by specific type of T cell receptor chains has not been illustrated so far. Previous studies have reported abnormal TCR repertoires and clonally expanded TCR V\u03b2 T cells in chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CP-CML). In this study, we investigated the distribution and clonality of the TCR V\u03b2 repertoire in 5 CML patients in blast crisis (BC-CML) and one in acceleration phase (AP-CML) with ABL kinase domain mutations (KDMs) including T315I, E255K, F317L+S417Y, Y-253F and L387M+T-315A. Examination of TCR V\u03b2 expression and clonality was performed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) combined with GeneScan analysis. Significantly skewed TCR V\u03b2 repertoires were observed in those patients, and 4 to 8 oligoclonally expanded TCR V\u03b2 subfamilies could be identified in each sample, which distributed in 15/24 different subfamilies ( TCR V\u03b24, V\u03b25, V\u03b26, \u03b28, V\u03b29, V\u03b210, V\u03b215, V\u03b216, V\u03b217, V\u03b218, V\u03b219, V\u03b221, V\u03b222, V\u03b223, V\u03b224 ). Intriguingly, a relatively highly expanded V\u03b29 clone with the same length as CDR3 (139 bp) was found in all three CML patients in lymphoid blast crisis (LBC-CML) who had different KDMs, but the clone was not detected in the other two CML patient in myeloid blast crisis (MBC-CML) or the one CML patients in accelerated phase. In conclusion, restricted TCR V\u03b2 repertoire expression and decreased clone complexity was a general phenomenon in the BC-CML patients with different KDMs, indicating the T-cell immunodeficiency status of these patients, and clonally expanded V\u03b29 T cell clones may represent a specific immune response to leukemia-associated antigens in LBC-CML patients.
