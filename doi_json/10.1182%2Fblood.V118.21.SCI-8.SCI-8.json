    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-8 Children with Down syndrome are at a markedly increased risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (DS-ALL). These leukemias are exclusively of the B lymphoid precursor phenotype and occur in a similar age to \u201ccommon\u201d sporadic ALLs with the striking absence of infant ALL. Recent studies reveal that DS-ALLs are heterogeneous and differ from sporadic ALLs. Only about a fifth of DS-ALLs carry the common cytogenetic aberrations typical to childhood ALL. Genomic rearrangements leading to the expression of a cytokine receptor, CRLF2, are detected in 60% of DS-ALL in comparison with up to 10% of sporadic ALLs. CRLF2 heterodimerizes with Interleukin 7 receptor-\u03b1 (IL7R) to form the receptor to thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). This receptor is usually present in macrophages, dendritic cells, and some T lymphocytes and participates in allergic and inflammatory processes. The aberrant expression of the TSLP receptor is DS-ALL (and sporadic ALL) is often associated with additional mutations that cause constitutive activation of the downstream JAK-STAT and mTOR growth signaling pathways. These are either lymphoid specific activating mutations of JAK2 or JAK1 or mutations in CRLF2 or IL7R that cause ligand-independent receptor dimerization. The role of the trisomy in selecting these somatic abnormalities is presently unknown. Clinically, the prognosis of DS-ALL is inferior to sporadic ALL mainly because of increased treatment toxicity. However, recent data suggest that the inferior outcome may also be related to the genetic properties of the leukemic cells and that excessive chemotherapy dose reduction may not be appropriate for these patients. Therefore increased vigilance for infectious complications and optimal supportive care are required during periods of intensive chemotherapy. The common activation of the TSLP signaling pathway in DS-ALLs suggests a future for targeted therapy with JAK and/or mTOR inhibitors. Importantly, research of DS-ALL has proven relevant for the general patient population with ALL, as somatic mutations in the TSLP pathway have been discovered in children and adults with sporadic ALL. A major research challenge is the elucidation of the roles of constitutional and somatic trisomy 21 in leukemogenesis. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
