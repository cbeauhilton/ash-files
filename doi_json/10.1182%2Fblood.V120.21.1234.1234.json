    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1234 Specialized bone marrow (BM) microenvironment niches are essential for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell maintenance, and recent publications have focused on the leukemic stem cells interaction and placement within those sites. Surprisingly, little is known about how the integrity of this leukemic niche changes the normal stem and progenitor cells behavior and functionality. To address this issue, we started by studying the kinetics and differentiation of normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in mice with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). CML accounts for \u223c15% of all adult leukemias and is characterized by the BCR-ABL t(9;22) translocation. Therefore, we used a novel SCL-tTA BCR/ABL inducible mouse model of CML-chronic phase to investigate these issues. To this end, BM from leukemic and normal mice were mixed and co-transplanted into hosts. Although normal hematopoiesis was increasingly suppressed during the disease progression, the leukemic microenvironment imposed distinct effects on hematopoietic progenitor cells predisposing them toward the myeloid lineage. Indeed, normal hematopoietic progenitor cells from this leukemic environment demonstrated accelerated proliferation with a lack of lymphoid potential, similar to that of the companion leukemic population. Meanwhile, the leukemic-exposed normal hematopoietic stem cells were kept in a more quiescent state, but remained functional on transplantation with only modest changes in both engraftment and homing. Further analysis of the microenvironment identified several cytokines that were found to be dysregulated in the leukemia and potentially responsible for these bystander responses. We investigated a few of these cytokines and found IL-6 to play a crucial role in the perturbation of normal stem and progenitor cells observed in the leukemic environment. Interestingly, mice treated with anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody reduced both the myeloid bias and proliferation defects of normal stem and progenitor cells. Results obtained with this mouse model were similarly validated using specimens obtained from CML patients. Co-culture of primary CML patient samples and GFP labeled human CD34+CD38- adult stem cells resulted in selective proliferation of the normal primitive progenitors compared to mixed cultures containing unlabeled normal bone marrow. Proliferation was blocked by adding anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibody to these co-cultures. Therefore, our current study provides definitive support and an underlying crucial mechanism for the hematopoietic perturbation of normal stem and progenitor cells during leukemogenesis. We believe our study to have important implications for cancer prevention and novel therapeutic approach for leukemia patients. We conclude that changes in cytokine levels and in particular those of IL-6 in the CML microenvironment are responsible for altered differentiation and functionality of normal stem cells.
