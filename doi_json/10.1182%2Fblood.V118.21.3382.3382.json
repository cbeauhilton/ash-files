    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3382 Runt-Related Transcription Factor 1 ( RUNX1 ; also called as Acute Myeloid Leukemia 1 : AML1 ) is one of the most frequently mutated genes associated with human acute leukemia, and encodes DNA binding subunit of the Core-Binding Factor (CBF) transcription complex whose activity is essential for the development of definitive hematopoiesis. RUNX1 serves as a transcriptional activator as well as a repressor to its target genes, depending on the cellular context, mediated through its interaction with co-factors. Increasing evidence obtained these days suggests that post-translational modification of RUNX1, including phosphorylation, methylation, or acetylation on its target amino acid residues, is important for proper and fine tuning of this RUNX1-function, likely by altering its association with functional cofactors. However, biological significance of these modifications has not yet been examined in detail. As an initial effort towards systematic comprehension how these modifications influence RUNX1 function, we tried to evaluate RUNX1 methylation in vitro in this study. Arginine residues just douwnstream to the Runt-domain of RUNX1 were recently reported to be methylated to inhibit corepressor-binding thus enhances its trans -activating activity. In order to elucidate the biological effects of this post-translational modification, we manufactured arginine-to-lysine substitutions at the sites within the mouse cDNA. When these arginine-mutants were exogenously expressed in mammalian cell lines, they showed reduced trans- activating activity detected by a dual-luciferase assay on known reporter constructs in comparison to the wild-type Runx1, confirming previous reports. We then introduced the mutant cDNA into Runx1 -deficient mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by means of a knock-in strategy at the disrupted Runx1 gene locus. These ES cell clones were subjected to the in vitro differentiation to hematopoietic lineages. Wild-type ES cells are known to differentiate into hematopoietic cell lineages via embryoid body formation in a semi-solid culture system, whereas ES cells of Runx1- deficient genotype lose the ability to undergo hematopoietic differentiation. This phenomenon is recognized to be an in vitro phenocopy of the Runx1- deficient mice that suffer from embryonic death due to complete block of fetal liver hematopoiesis. Initial study so far showed that the Runx1- deficient ES cell clones restored the ability to develop hematopoietic cells including macrophages in culture when the arginine-mutant cDNA was re-expressed from the knock-in allele, as is the case for the control Runx1- deficient ES cells with the knocked-in wild-type Runx1 . These results suggest that this arginine-to-lysine mutation is dispensable, at least, for the in vitro hematopoietic function of wild-type Runx1 although its trans- activating activity is somewhat impaired. We are currently focusing on introducing this mutation into mouse germ line, and the resultant genome-modified mice should show us the biological significance of the methylation-modification to this important molecule in the context of an entire animal.
