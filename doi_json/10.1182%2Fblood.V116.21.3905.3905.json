    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3905 Immune regulation is central for the development of an efficient cellular immune response. Both Treg cells and plasmacytoid DC can suppress T cell proliferation in a granzyme B (GzmB)-dependent and perforin-independent manner. In the present study we found that, depending on stimulation with interleukin (IL-) 21, B cells (BC) can also express GzmB and effectively suppress T cell proliferation. GzmB expression in BC is enhanced by BC receptor engagement, and is suppressed by CD40 ligation. Since CD4+ T cells are a main source of IL-21, we tested whether they can induce GzmB in BC. We found that incompletely activated CD4+ T cells, but not fully activated T cells induce GzmB in co-cultured BC. Using confocal microscopy, we showed that BC-derived GzmB is enzymatically active and that GzmB+ BC transfer GzmB to CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, GzmB+ BC decreased CD4+ T cell expression of the TCR-zeta chain, a GzmB target, which is required for T cell proliferation. Our results suggest BC may regulate cellular adaptive immune responses by Treg cell-like mechanisms. Inhibition of BC-derived GzmB may represent a novel strategy to induce more effective and comprehensive cellular immune responses. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
