    "abstract_text": "Granulocytic sarcoma (GS) is a rare extra medullary manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It may also represent blastic transformation of myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative neoplasms. Although usually seen in the context of advanced and poorly controlled disease, it may also present as the first manifestation of illness, without concurrent bone marrow or blood involvement. In the medical literature chloroma and GS are terms that have been used interchangeably with myeloid sarcoma. GS usually manifest as soft tissue or bony masses in several extra cranial sites such as bone, periosteum and lymph nodes; involvement of the head and neck region is uncommon. Herein, we report a case of a 63 yearr-old woman with insidious onset of progressive nasal congestion and diminished hearing who was diagnosed with an isolated GS of the nasopharynx. With involved field radiotherapy she achieved a complete remission of 12 months duration before being diagnosed with overt AML. Following induction and consolidation chemotherapy she has remained disease free for now greater than 18 months. Through a MEDLINE\u00ae/PubMed\u00ae search we identified an additional 13 cases of nasopharyngeal GC. The median age was 37 years (range, 1 to 81 years). The cases were equally distributed among the sexes. The most common presenting symptoms were conductive hearing loss and sino-nasal congestion. Isolated GC was identified in 6 cases and the median time from diagnosis of GS to AML was 12 months (range, 3 to 48 months). Treatment varied, but responses were seen in all patients who received chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy.  REFERENCE (YEAR) . AGE (YEARS), SEX . CLINICAL FEATURES . ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS .
