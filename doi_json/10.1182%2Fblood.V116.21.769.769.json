    "abstract_text": "Abstract 769 Despite the many and diverse therapeutic approaches used to treat patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), it remains an incurable disease. Recently, attention has turned into novel therapies targeting MCL-specific oncogenic pathways important for the growth and maintenance of the transformed phenotype. The chromosomal translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) leading to cyclin-D1 over-expression is the hallmark of MCL. Constitute cyclin-D1 activation in B-lymphocytes maintains retinoblastoma protein in a phosphorylated state and promotes cell cycling, thus initiating the tumorigenesis process. Cyclin-D1 has been postulated as a putative target for therapeutic intervention, however its evaluation has been hampered by the incomplete understanding of the mechanism underlying this cyclin oncogenic function and by the lack of valid MCL models. To investigate these issues, we developed a combined cellular-genomics screening whereby responses to known cytotoxic compounds targeting cancer-related molecular pathways were correlated with genomic, gene expression and proteomic profiles of human MCL cells. Results showed that cyclin-D1 silencing had minimal antitumoral effects but significantly increased the therapeutic efficacy of several compounds, especially the BH3 mimetics that inhibited anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2. To further evaluate this finding we generated a MCL mouse model by transducing a tetracycline-regulatable cyclin-D1-expressing vector in murine pro-B cells, which allowed modulating cyclin-D1 expression levels. These mice generated lymphomas recapitulating most of the cellular, histopathological and molecular features of human MCL. Similar to the previous in vitro findings, cyclin-D1 inhibition in this model did not induce lymphoma regression, but sensitized cells to apoptosis. Analysis of the mechanisms underlying this therapeutic synergy identified a novel role for cyclin-D1 as a pro-survival molecule. Specifically, cyclin-D1 sequestrated the pro-apoptotic effector protein BAX in MCL cells, thereby favoring BCL2 anti-apoptotic function. Accordingly, therapeutic cyclin-D1 inactivation released BAX, thus sensitizing cells to apoptosis and inducing lymphoma regression. Interestingly, pharmacological blockade in vivo of cyclin-D1 with Roscovitine synergistically cooperated with the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 to effectively inhibit MCL tumor growth. In summary, our study reveals a novel role for cyclin-D1 in deregulating apoptosis in MCL cells and highlights the potential benefit of cyclin-D1 targeting, thus providing the rationale for the clinical evaluation of drugs targeting cell proliferation and survival pathways in MCL.
