    "abstract_text": "Background : SL-401 is a novel targeted therapy directed to the interleukin-3 receptor (CD123), a target overexpressed by many hematologic malignancies. SL-401 is currently being advanced through clinical trials in patients with a variety of CD123 + malignancies including blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in remission with high relapse risk, and multiple myeloma. CD123 has been shown to be expressed on myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) cells as well as microenvironmental immune cells, namely plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), in the bone marrows of some patients with MPN including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Microenvironmental pDCs have been implicated in promoting plasma cell disorders and preliminary data suggest that pDCs could play a related role in some myeloid neoplasms. Accordingly, a therapy directed at both CD123-expressing myeloid cells and neighboring CD123-expressing pDCs could provide therapeutic benefit. SL-401 is being evaluated in patients with advanced, high-risk MPN, including systemic mastocytosis (SM), myelofibrosis (MF), primary eosinophilic disorders (PED), and CMML. Preliminary results are reported here. Methods & Results : This multicenter, single-arm Phase 2 trial of patients with advanced, high risk MPN includes a lead-in (stage 1) and expansion (stage 2). In stage 1, patients receive SL-401 as a daily IV infusion at 7, 9, 12 ug/kg/day, or higher for days 1-3 of a 21-28 day cycle in a 3x3 design. In stage 2, patients receive SL-401 at the dose determined in stage 1. Study objectives include characterization of the safety profile, including determination of the maximum tolerated or tested dose, and detection of preliminary efficacy signals including evaluation of tumor response and progression free survival by standard criteria. As of 7/20/16, 6 patients with MPN (MF, n=3; CMML-2, n=2; CMML-1, n=1) received SL-401 (7 ug/kg, n=3; 9 ug/kg, n=3). The median age was 66 years (range: 42-81 years). Patients treated at all doses received 1 + to 2 + cycles (ongoing) of SL-401. The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were thrombocytopenia (2/6; 33%) and fatigue (2/6; 33%); the most common \u2265 Grade 3 treatment-related AEs were thrombocytopenia (2/6; 33%) and anemia (1/6; 17%); there has been no DLT. Efficacy assessments are ongoing. Patients are currently enrolling in the 12 ug/kg/day cohort. Conclusions : Initial dosing of SL-401 appears to be well-tolerated in patients with MPN and CMML, with no unexpected AEs observed. Given CD123 expression on myeloid neoplastic cells as well as microenvironmental immune cells (namely, pDCs), SL-401 may offer a novel, targeted therapeutic approach in patients with high-risk MPN and CMML of unmet medical need. Enrollment continues in stage 1 of this ongoing Phase 2 trial and updated safety and efficacy data will be presented. Clinical trial information: NCT02268253.
