    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3702 Introduction: Romiplostim is a novel peptibody that increases platelet counts by a mechanism similar to endogenous thrombopoietin, and is approved for the treatment of chronic ITP. ITP is characterized by low platelet counts due to increased platelet destruction and suboptimal platelet production. The response rate to ITP therapies is variable and may be associated with substantial adverse effects. Splenectomy is commonly used as a treatment for ITP because it removes the major site of platelet destruction. A recent consensus report (Provan et al., 2010, 168\u201386) recommends delaying splenectomy for 6\u201312 months, in keeping with the new definition for chronic ITP (Rodeghiero et al., Blood 2009, 2386\u201393); therefore, we evaluated patients who had been diagnosed with ITP \u22641 year who participated in a recent study of romiplostim versus standard of care (SOC). Methods: A randomized, open-label study was conducted in nonsplenectomized adult patients with ITP. The co-primary study endpoints were the incidence of treatment failure and the incidence of splenectomy. Treatment failure was defined as: platelet count \u226420 \u00d7 10 9 /L for 4 consecutive weeks at the highest recommended dose and schedule of romiplostim or SOC, or major bleeding event, or change in therapy due to intolerable side-effect or bleeding symptoms. The secondary endpoints included platelet counts and safety. Patients who discontinued treatment were considered to have met both primary endpoints. To assess the impact of study discontinuation on the primary endpoints, the actual incidence of treatment failure and splenectomy were also determined (\u201csensitivity analysis\u201d). An ad hoc analysis of the study endpoints was conducted in those study patients who had been diagnosed with ITP for \u22641 year. Results: Eighty-five of 234 enrolled patients had ITP for \u22641 year; 29 received SOC and 56 received weekly subcutaneous injections of romiplostim. Patient characteristics were similar between treatment groups, as was the distribution of time since ITP diagnosis (romiplostim, 7 \u2013 327 days; SOC 4 \u2013 363 days). The mean (\u00b1SD) age was 53 (\u00b120) years and 47% of the patients were male. The mean baseline platelet counts were similar in the romiplostim (26 \u00b1 14 \u00d7 10 9 /L) and SOC (23 \u00b1 16 \u00d7 10 9 /L) groups. The mean platelet count was higher in the romiplostim arm than the SOC arm at every weekly evaluation until the end of treatment (52 weeks). The incidence of treatment failure was lower in the romiplostim group (9%, 5/56) than in the SOC group (24%, 7/29) [OR, 0.34; 0.10 \u2013 1.14; p= 0.0649]. Similarly, the incidence of splenectomy was significantly lower in the romiplostim group (7%, 4/56) than the SOC group (45%, 13/29) [OR, 0.10; 0.03 \u2013 0.35; p<0.0001]. In addition, romiplostim-treated patients had a significantly longer time to splenectomy than SOC patients (p=0.0001) ( Figure ). The sensitivity analysis showed that the actual incidence of treatment failure was similar between treatment groups (romiplostim, 5%, 3/56; SOC, 10%, 3/29) [p=0.5589] and the actual incidence of splenectomy was significantly lower in romiplostim-treated patients (4%, 2/56) than in SOC-treated patients (35%, 10/29) [p=.0002]. The percentage of patients experiencing a serious bleeding event was similar (romiplostim, 6%; SOC, 4%). Serious adverse events occurred in 24% (13/55) of romiplostim patients and 46% (13/28) of SOC patients with the most common event being thrombocytopenia. No adverse events led to study withdrawal. Thromboembolic events occurred in one romiplostim-treated patient (pulmonary embolism) and one SOC patient (cerebral microangiopathy). There were no reports of increased reticulin, and no patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim or TPO.

Romiplostim was well-tolerated in this patient population, and findings were similar to those previously reported for the study population overall (Kuter et al., ASH 2009, #679).
