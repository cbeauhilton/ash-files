    "abstract_text": "Background: Early T precursor ALL has been defined as a poor prognosis subtype, characterized phenotypically by absence of CD1a and CD8, CD5 weak expression and presence of at least one myeloid and progenitor cell marker. Objectives: Our aims were to identify Early T-ALL among our T ALL cases, based on the characteristic phenotype and thus evaluate the prevalence, biological characteristics and outcome of this particular subset of T-ALL Methods: From April \u201994 to December \u201913, 197 T-ALL cases were diagnosed and 20 of them showed the typical Early T marker profile by flow cytometry (FC). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH and RT-PCR studies were performed according to standard techniques. Clonality assessment for TRG, TRB, TRD, IGH and IGK was performed by PCR (Biomed-2), heteroduplex and sequencing. Results: Sex distribution was: 16 males and 4 females; median of age: 7.9 (range: 0.3-16.6) years; median WBC: 14.9 (range: 0.6-254.0) x10 9 /L. All but one case expressed CD34, 70% HLA-DR, 61% CD117 and 50% TdT. The most frequently expressed myeloid markers were: CD33 (85%) and CD13 (55%). Three cases expressed g/d TCR. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 14 of 16 evaluated cases, in 5 of them compromising 12p13 region. TCR/IgH rearrangements were detected in 63% (10/16). FLT3-ITD mutations were found in 14 % (2/14). Patients were treated with BFM-based ALL schedules and were stratified as Intermediate Risk ALL (n: 7) and High Risk ALL (n: 13) according to protocol criteria. Early response to treatment was poor in 16 cases: 6 presented poor response to prednisone (day 8), 3 MRD >10%, 5 presented bone marrow M2-M3 and 2 non response. Seventeen cases (85%) achieved CR on day 33 and 2 achieved CR later. Five patients underwent HSCT in first CR. Three patients relapsed at 5, 6 and 65 months from diagnosis and one showed lineage switch to M5-AML at 12 months from CR. Three pts died in CR (2 after HSCT and 1 patient with primary immunodeficiency due to pneumonia) and one is in palliative care. Twelve patients remain in CR with a median follow-up of 54 (r: 8-144) months. Conclusions: The prevalence of Early T precursor phenotype within T ALL was 10.5% in our setting. The most frequent progenitor marker was CD34 and CD33 among myeloid markers. Of note, translocations involving 12p13 region were found in 5 patients. Sixty percent of patients remain disease free, although longer follow-up is needed in order to define prognosis of this group in our cohort of patients. The lineage switch case supports the notion of the myeloid differentiation potential of these blasts. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
