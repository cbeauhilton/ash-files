    "abstract_text": "Background: Protein kinase C (PKC) is known to regulate various aspects of platelet functions. In platelets, PKC\u03b4 is known to both positively and negatively regulate dense granule secretion in response to PAR and GPVI agonists, respectively. Hence, we speculate that the differential regulation of PKC\u03b4 in platelets is due to differences in tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4. Results: We investigated several phosphorylation sites on PKC\u03b4 and found that Y311 is phosphorylated downstream of PAR agonists to a greater extent than GPVI agonists in human and murine platelets when feedback is blocked. Hence, the focus of this study is to characterize the function of PKC\u03b4 tyrosine Y311 in platelets. Therefore, we generated PKC\u03b4Y311F knock-in mice to study the contribution of Y311 on PKC\u03b4 to PAR-4-mediated platelet activation. PKC\u03b4Y311F mice are viable and have no gross abnormalities. Washed platelets from PKC\u03b4Y311F mice have reduced aggregation and dense granule secretion after stimulation with AYPGKF, a PAR-4 agonist (Fig. 1) indicating its importance in PAR-4 mediated signaling. In an in vivo tail-bleeding assay, PKC\u03b4Y311 mice have significantly enhanced tail-bleeding times compared to wild-type (WT) littermate controls (Fig. 2). Finally, PKC\u03b4Y311F mice exhibit longer time to occlusion compared to WT control using a ferric chloride in vivo thrombosis model. This indicates that the phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4 Y311 is pro-thrombotic. At the molecular level, PKC\u03b4Y311 was phosphorylated in Fyn -/- null platelets but not in Lyn -/- platelets by AYPGKF, indicating that Lyn phosphorylates this tyrosine residue. Conclusions: Phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4 on Y311 is important for regulation of platelet functional responses initiated by thrombin.
