    "abstract_text": "Background. As a part of a multicenter, observational study in determining the prevalence and risk factors of elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) in children, oxygen desaturation correlated with TRV. We further investigated the risk factors and clinical associations of oxygen desaturation at rest and after execrcise in children at steady state. Methods. 310 children and adolescents with sickle cell disease were studied under basal conditions. Pulse oximetry was determined at rest and after a six minute walk test. The relationships of oxygen saturation at rest and desaturation during exercise to the available clinical and laboratory variables were investigated. Results. Among 300 patients with available baseline oxygen saturations, 30 (10%) had saturation 98 percent. Twenty-three (9%) of 244 patients had >3 percentage point reduction in oxygen saturation during a six minute walk; the median (interquartile range) baseline saturation was 96 (95\u2013 99) percent among these patients versus 98 (97\u2013100) percent among those with less or no reduction in saturation during the walk (P = 0.0009). Hemoglobin (p3 percentage points during the walk while a hemolytic index (p3 percentage points. Conclusion. Markers of hemolysis, low hemoglobin, PIEDV, LVMI, LVIDD z score, lower TLC, and elevated TRV velocities are associated with \u22653% reduction in oxygen desaturation during six minute walk in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease. A high degree of oxygen desaturation during the six minute walk in sickle cell disease patients might serve as an early biomarker for pulmonary hypertension. Exercise induced changes in oxygen saturation in sickle cell disease children may provide insight into the development of pulmonary hypertension as adults."
