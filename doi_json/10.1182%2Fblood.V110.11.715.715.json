    "abstract_text": "Recent discoveries have implicated microRNAs, which are small 22\u201324 nucleotide long RNA molecules, as important regulators of many cellular processes, including differentiation and development. The microRNA-155 (miR-155) is known to be overexpressed in subsets of B-cell neoplasms and is thought to be important in the activation and function of B-lymphocytes. Here, we show that miR-155 is signficantly overexpressed in human acute myeloid leukemia and that its overexpression is most consistently seen in acute myelomonocytic leukemia. These findings led us to investigate the effects of overexpression of miR-155 in hematopoietic cells. By utilizing retroviral infection and transfer of murine bone marrow, we introduced miR-155 overexpressing hematopoietic stem cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Following reconstitution of hematopoietic organs, the mice demonstrated a profound myeloproliferative condition in the bone marrow characterized by replacement of the marrow by proliferating and dysplastic myelomonocytic cells. In addition, extramedullary hematopoiesis was observed in the spleen and examination of the peripheral blood revealed anemia and thrombocytopenia. To begin to explore the mechanisms whereby miR-155 overexpression results in this myeloproliferative phenotype, we utilized computational methods to identify targets predicted to be regulated by miR-155. This revealed several genes that have previously been implicated in myeloid development and neoplasia, which were confirmed to be targets of miR-155 by reverse-transcription/quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT/QPCR) and by downregulation of luciferase protein upon fusion of the luc gene with the respective 3\u2032 untranslated regions. These studies show a hitherto uncharacterized role of miR-155 in myeloid development and proliferation. Importantly, these findings lay the groundwork for understanding the complex regulatory networks underlying myeloid development in the context of microRNAs, and may point to new therapeutic opportunities in the treatment of myeloid malignancies.",
