    "abstract_text": "Background: CLL is one of the most common types of leukemia among adults. Treatment options for CLL have expanded in recent years, but few studies provide contemporary real-world data on treatment patterns, treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and the economic burden associated with these agents. This study aimed to evaluate treatment-related AEs and the healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and cost associated with the current treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Methods: This retrospective study used medical and pharmacy claims from the Optum Research Database, a large national US database, to identify adults (\u2265 18 years old) commercially insured and Medicare Advantage (MA) enrollees. The study included patients with CLL (\u2265 2 medical claims at least 7 days apart between July 1, 2012, through May 30, 2017), at least 1 claim for systemic CLL-directed therapy and continuous enrollment for 12 months prior to (baseline period) and \u2265 1 month after the first observed CLL-directed therapy (index date). Patients with systemic CLL-directed therapy during the baseline period or undergoing stem cell transplantation during the entire study period were excluded from analysis. Up to 3 line of therapy (LOT) periods were captured based on timing and receipt of systemic CLL-directed therapy. Cohorts based on the most common regimens received, regardless of LOT sequence, were created. Potential treatment-related AEs (prevalent and incident conditions) during regimen cohorts were identified by ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes in position 1 or 2 on claims. All-cause and AE-related healthcare resource utilization and costs (per patient per month (PPPM)) were examined. All analyses were descriptive. Results : A total of 3292 patients with CLL met all study criteria; 65% were MA enrollees and 35% were commercially insured. Mean age (standard deviation, [SD]) was 71 years (SD 11) with a baseline Charlson comorbidity index score of 3.5 (SD 1.9). During the study period, 31% of patients had \u2265 2 LOTs and 10% had \u2265 3 LOTs. The most common regimens (excluding rituximab maintenance therapy) observed by LOT were; bendamustine + rituximab (23%) during LOT1, ibrutinib (22%) during LOT2 and ibrutinib (17%) during LOT3. Among the study patients, 4,509 LOT periods (LOT1-LOT3) were observed. Of these periods, 3177 accounted for the 5 most common treatment regimens observed: rituximab (excluding maintenance therapy) (30%); bendamustine + rituximab (28%); ibrutinib (20%); obinutuzumab \u00b1 chlorambucil (14%); and cyclophosphamide + fludarabine + rituximab (8%). The most common AEs associated with these treatment regimens are reported in the Table. Conclusions: The most common regimen during LOT1 was bendamustine + rituximab, and was ibrutinib during LOT2 and LOT3.This study provides evidence that occurrence of AEs among patients with CLL receiving systemic anti-cancer therapy in the real-world setting is substantial and associated with significant health care cost. The economic burden associated with increased AEs underscores the need for treatments with fewer AEs. Figure. View large Download slide Figure.
