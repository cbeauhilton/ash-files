    "abstract_text": "Benzene is a potent human leukemogen, but its mechanism of hematotoxicity is uncertain. It is well know that benzene inhibit T cells proliferation. Several reports revealed that clonal expansion TCR V\u03b2 T cells could be found in workers exposed to benzene. In this study we observe the distribution of TCR V\u03b1 gene repertoire and clonal expansion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 9 donors and 16 workers exposed to benzene. Complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) of TCR V\u03b1 subfamily genes were amplified using RT-PCR. The PCR products were further analyzed by genescan to evaluating clonality of T cells. 29 V\u03b1 subfamily could be detected in 9 donors.1~11 V\u03b1 subfamilies were identified in all but one of the workers studied. The most frequently expressed V\u03b1 subfamily were V\u03b1 3 , V\u03b1 12 and V\u03b1 19 (68.8%), V\u03b1 14 (56.3%), with a lower expression rate found in V\u03b1 5, V\u03b1 15 , V\u03b1 16 , V\u03b1 22 , V\u03b1 23 and V\u03b1 24 (6.3%). Clonal expansion T cells in one or more V\u03b1 subfamily were found in 12 out of all workers studied, including oligoclonal, oligocolonal trend and bioclonal patterns. The frequency of clonal expansion T cells in V\u03b1 12 , V\u03b1 14 and V\u03b1 19 subfamilies were higher than others. In conclusion, skewed distribution and clonal expansion of TCR V\u03b1 subfamily T cells could be found in workers exposed to benzene. V\u03b1 12 , V\u03b1 14 and V\u03b1 19 subfamilies may be highly sensitive to benzene exposed. This is the first report of clonal expansion TCR V\u03b1 T cells in the benzene-exposed group. The bias pattern of TCR V\u03b1 T cells may be due to the immune cytotocicity from benzene. However, whether the oligoclonality in some V\u03b1 subfamilies reflect the phenomenon of clone absense or may be a response clone to benzene-related impairment during exposed to benzene, remains an open question.",
