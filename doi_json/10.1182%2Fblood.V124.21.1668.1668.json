    "abstract_text": "Background The International Prognostic Index (IPI) has been useful prognostic tool to predict prognosis of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the last 20 years. Since the advent of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), its utility has been challenged and other prognostic index including revised IPI and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-IPI were proposed, which are not popularly used yet. We aimed to develop new prognostic model for DLBCL in rituximab era. Method Between March 2004 and June 2012, patients with DLBCL treated with R-CHOP were identified in the database of the Asan Medical Center (AMC) Lymphoma Registry. Primary end point was to devise a new prognostic index for DLBCL. Secondary end point was to validate the NCCN-IPI in our cohort. We tested new prognostic index model in the training set of AMC cohort consisted of randomly selected 80% of the sample (503 patients). The remaining 20% (118 patients) was used as an internal validations set. Results The AMC cohort consisted of 621 patients. Median follow-up duration was 43.3 months (6.2-122.5 months). Baseline characteristics of AMC cohort are presented in table 1. Median age was 57 years (range, 16-85 years). Median \u03d0-2 microglobulin (\u03d0-2 MG) was 2.10 mg/L (range, 1.0-66.0 mg/L). The univariate analysis of baseline characteristics revealed that age (\u226660 vs. >60 years), LDH (within normal vs. increased), ECOG performance (0 or 1 vs. \u22672), advanced stage (Ann Arbor stage I/II vs. III/IV), extra-nodal involvement (\u22661 vs. >1), B symptoms (no vs. yes), and \u03d0-2 MG (\u22662.5 vs. >2.5) could predict overall survival (OS), whereas bulky disease and gender did not (p value 0.140, 0.621, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, age, LDH, ECOG performance status, and \u03d0-2 MG were significantly associated with OS (p value 0.001, <0.001, 0.004, and 0.019, respectively), while stage, extra-nodal involvement, and B symptom did not (p value 0.057, 0.233, and 0.577, respectively). We developed a new prognostic model with these 4 significant factors in the multivariate analysis. One point is assigned for each of the risk factors without refined categorization. Four risk groups were composed as followings: low (0 point), low-intermediate (1 point), high-intermediate (2-3 points), and high (4 points). The new prognostic model showed better discriminative power compared with classic IPI ( Figure 1 A). Five-year OS of low- and high-risk subgroup in new scoring model and classic IPI model in AMC cohort were 95% and 32% versus 89% and 45%, respectively. Our model was validated in an internal validation set ( Figure 1 B). NCCN-IPI also could stratify four risk groups ( Figure 1 A and B). Conclusion We propose a new prognostic index model for DLBCL in rituximab era with age, LDH, ECOG performance and \u03d0-2 MG, which has good discriminative power and convenient to apply. It warrants further validation using an independent cohort. Table 1. Baseline Characteristics  Characteristics . Total N=621 % . Training set N=503 % . Validation set N=118 % .
