    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3310 Our previous reports showed that survival/apoptosis of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) modulates vascular inflammation even though the mode of Tregs inhibition was unknown. Interleukin-35 (IL-35), consisting of two subunits Epstein-Barr virus\u2013induced gene 3 (EBI3) and p35, is a novel anti-inflammatory cytokine, which is a member of the interleukin-12 (IL-12) cytokine family. IL-35 is produced by Tregs. It has been shown that IL-35 suppresses chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma and inflammatory bowel diseases. However, an important question of whether IL-35 can carry out Tregs suppression and inhibit endothelial cell (EC) activation in acute inflammation remained unknown. Here we found that IL-35 significantly inhibits lung neutrophil infiltration into the surrounding areas of bronchioles and alveolar space when induced by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in wild type mice and EBI3-deficient mice. Furthermore, cremaster microvasculature study using intravital microscopy showed IL-35 significantly suppresses leukocyte adhesion to the vascular wall as well, suggesting IL-35 inhibition of endothelial activation. Mechanistically, IL-35 inhibited LPS-induced upregulation of adhesion molecules on human aortic endothelial cells, a marker of endothelial activation, including vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). IL-35 acted through new IL-35 dimeric receptors gp130 and IL-12R\u03b22, and inhibited VCAM-1 promoter transcription in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated pathway. These results provide a novel insight on Tregs and IL-35 inhibition of vascular inflammation. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
