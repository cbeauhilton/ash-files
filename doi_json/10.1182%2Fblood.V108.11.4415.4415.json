    "abstract_text": "Background: The objective of the current study was to assess the correlation between the expression of TNF from bone marrow specimens and survival in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis of bone marrow biopsies from 10 patients recently diagnosed with AML was performed using the dakocytomation LSAB + system -HRP kit, to stain for TNF binding. TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b2 expression were analyzed for color intensity and assigned a score from (0\u20135+) with 5+ being bright and over-expressed. Results: Bone marrow specimens from 4 women and 6 men (n=10), median age 34 (range 19\u201361 years), all diagnosed with AML, revealed high TNF-\u03b2 expression (3, 4, 5+) in 8/10 patients and high TNF-\u03b1 expression (3, 4, 5+) in 6/10 patients. Median survival was 5.5 (range 1\u201354 months). Fisher\u2019s exact tests for paired samples showed no correlation between predictors (age, sex, survival) and outcomes (TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2). Pearson Chi-square tests showed no correlation between predictors (age, sex, survival) and outcomes (high TNF-\u03b1 / high TNF-\u03b2 expression, mixed TNF-\u03b1 /TNF-\u03b2 expression, low TNF-\u03b1 / low TNF-\u03b2 expression) [See chart below]. However there was an association seen with younger males expressing both high TNF-\u03b1 and high TNF-\u03b2 and older women expressing low TNF-\u03b1 and low TNF-\u03b2. Interestingly, the eldest patient who expressed TNF-\u03b2 4+ and TNF-\u03b1 3+ also survived the longest. He achieved clinical remission after standard induction chemotherapy, but relapsed 8 times over a course of 54 months. During each clinical remission, the patient was treated with infliximab (a TNF-\u03b1 blocker) for his Crohn\u2019s disease. Conclusion: Level of expression of TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b2 of bone marrow biopsies from our AML patients showed no correlation with age, sex or overall survival given the small sample size. A large, prospective trial will be needed to determine the significance of TNF-\u03b1 or TNF-\u03b2 expression with survival and whether TNF-\u03b1 blockade alone or in combination with chemotherapy plays a role in the treatment of patients with AML over-expressing TNF-\u03b1.
