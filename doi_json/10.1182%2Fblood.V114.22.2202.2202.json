    "abstract_text": "Abstract 2202 Poster Board II-179 Background: Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are known to show anti-proliferative effects and are anticipated as a potential drug in the treatment of malignancies. To investigate the effect simvastatin on chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, we treated simvastatin on 3 kinds of CML cell lines and CD34+ primary CML cells from patients: erythrocytic lineage (K-562), granulocytic lineage (KCL-22), erythroid-megakaryocytic (LAMA-84) cell line. Also, antiproliferative effect on imatinib-resistant CML cell lines was assessed. Mehtods: Anti-proliferative effect was assessed by CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V and Western blot study. Killing effect was calculated by CalcuSyn does effect analysis software (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO). CD34+cells for patients with CML were purified using immunomagnetic bead column. Cell cycle analysis was done by flow cytometrc method. Si-RNA transfection study for p27 gene was performed for verification of killing mechanism. Change of intracellular location of BCR/ABL protein was observed by confocal microscopy. Cellular changes of proteins and tyrosin phosphorylation after treatment of simvastain was evaluated by 2 dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrophotometer. In vivo effect of simvastain was evaluated in BALB/c-nude. Results: Simvastatin inhibited the proliferation of imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant K562 cell line in a dose dependent manner. The IC 50 values of simvastatin and imatinib in imatinib-sensitive K562 cells were 14.5 and 0.4 \u03bcM. Treatment of simvastain induced apoptosis both in capase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways in all 3 cell lines; apoptosis by Annexin V analysis and increased apoptotic proteins (cytochrome C, AIF, Smac/Diablo, caspase-3, and caspase-9) by western blot. Cell cycle analysis revealed the G1/S arrest on treatment of simvastatin and si-RNA transfection specific for p27 reversed the G1/S arrest, suggesting cell cycle arrest as one of anti-proliferative mechanism. Co-treatment of imatinib and simvastain showed synergistic killing interactions between simvastatin and imatinib in imatinib-resistant K562 cells (mean combination index values were 0.56, P < 0.001). Enhanced killing effect was observed in all 3 imatinib-resistant CML cell lines (K-562: 0.6, KCL-22: 0.42 , LAMA-84; 0.99). Co-treatment with imatinib and simvastatin decreased the amount of Bcr-Abl protein and stimulated the import of Abl protein in the nuclei in K562 cells. In CML cells, simvastatin inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation included protease, cytocrome-c reductase, DNA/RNA processing proteins, oxidoructase protein, chaperones, glycolysis protein, cytoskeleton proteins, microtubule protein. Treatment of simvastain reduced subcutaneous tumor mass in nude mice. Conclusion: We showed that simvastatin killed CML cells in vitro and in vivo animal model and killing effect occurred via the induction of apoptosis, cell cyle arrest via p27 and inhibited BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase (TK) activity. Simvastatin may be a potential candidate for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML patients and the effective dose of imatinib could be reduced in a combined treatment with simvastatin.
