    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4504 Introduction Currently innate immune cells such as \u03b39\u03b42T cells are explored in tumor immunotherapy e.g. by adoptive transfer of in vitro expanded bulk \u03b39\u03b42T cells. Objective We speculated that \u03b39\u03b42T cells are highly variable in function and specificity due to differences in \u03b39\u03b42TCR, NKG2D and KIR expression and that efficacy of adoptively transferred \u03b39\u03b42T cells can be increased by transfer of defined subpopulations or clones rather than bulk \u03b39\u03b42T cells. Methods A variety of \u03b39\u03b42T cell clones, derived from a healthy donor, were tested for expression levels of \u03b39\u03b42TCR, NKG2D and KIRs by flow cytometry analysis. The sequence of the \u03b39\u03b42TCR of different clones was further analyzed. Reactivity of \u03b39\u03b42T cell clones to a panel of tumor and normal cell lines was tested and these functional analyses were correlated to receptor expression levels and compared with bulk \u03b39\u03b42T cells of the same donor. Results Functional analyses revealed a high interclonal variability in recognizing leukemia or solid tumor cell lines. Consequently, \u03b39\u03b42T cell clones with high anti-tumor reactivity were superior in killing tumor cells when compared to bulk \u03b39\u03b42T cells. Different variable regions of \u03b39\u03b42-chains and different expression levels of NKG2D and KIRs were detected in multiple clones. No correlations could be found between TCR, NKG2D, and KIR expression on \u03b39\u03b42T cell clones and their response to different tumor cell lines when clones expressed different \u03b39\u03b42TCRs. However, analysis of \u03b39\u03b42T-cell clones with identical \u03b39\u03b42TCRs revealed that a clone with higher reactivity against cancer cells expresses higher amounts of NKG2D and lower inhibitory KIRs when compared to a clone with lower reactivity. Conclusion \u03b39\u03b42TCR, NKG2D and KIR expression in \u03b39\u03b42T cells is highly variable and cannot be directly correlated to an effective anti-tumor response. Only, when T-cells express one defined \u03b39\u03b42TCR, a modulating activity of NKG2D and KIRs can be observed. Thus, we conclude that anti-tumor reactivity is fine tuned by all three receptors and thereby we speculate that the \u03b39\u03b42TCR defines tumor-specificity and activity is further modulated by NKG2D and KIRs. These results support the application of distinct subpopulations or of genetically engineered \u03b3\u03b4T cells with defined receptors rather than bulk \u03b39\u03b42T cells in the context of anti-tumor immunotherapies.
