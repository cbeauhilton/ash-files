    "abstract_text": "Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a lethal complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). As a complex immunopathology, aGVHD depends on the recognition of host antigens by donor T cells and induces augmented response of alloreactive T cells. Despite considerable achievements in the treatment of aGVHD, it remains a major clinical problem for the patients undergoing allo-HSCT. Therefore, it is necessary to further illustrate new mechanisms and develop novel therapeutic strategies of aGVHD. Previously we reported LYG1 (Lysozyme G-like 1) as a novel classical secretory protein promoted antitumor function of T cell. In this study, the role of LYG1 in aGVHD was investigated. Firstly, we examined whether LYG1 affected the alloreactivity of CD4+ T cells in vitro by MLR assay and discovered that LYG1 deficiency reduced the activation of CD4+ T cells and Th1 ratio, but increased Treg ratio. Then we confirmed these observations using a major MHC mismatched aGVHD model by transferring T cells sorting from WT B6 or Lyg1-/- mice with bone marrow cells from WT B6 mice into lethally irradiated BALB/c mice. The alloreactive CD4+ T cells and the proportions of Th1 cells decreased whereas the proportions of Treg cells increased in spleens and livers in mice receiving Lyg1-/- T cells. LYG1-deficient T cells attenuated aGVHD severity, inhibited the expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10 and restrained CD4+ T cells infiltrating in livers. Furthermore, administration of recombinant LYG1 protein intraperitoneally aggravated aGVHD by promoting IFN-\u03b3 production. More importantly, LYG1 deficiency did not affect GVT (graft-versus-tumor) effects. In summary, we demonstrate LYG1 regulates aGVHD via modulating the alloreactivity of CD4+ T cells and differentiation of Th1/Treg cells. Our study indicates that LYG1 may be a novel target in aGVHD by mitigating aGVHD without impairing GVT function. The therapeutic effect of targeting LYG1 is required in future investigations.
