    "abstract_text": "We have previously published that antagonizing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptors dramatically decreases PD-1 expression on activated CD8 + T-cells and increases antiviral immunity (Blood 2013, 121:2347-51; PLoS One 2013, 8: e63381). Herein we tested whether short-term pharmacological antagonism of VIP signaling could induce anti-tumor immune responses in mice. Methods B6 mice were inoculated with 0.5 - 2 x 10 6 luciferase + murine acute myeloid leukemia cells (Luc + C1498) and B10BR mice were injected with 3 x 10 6 luciferase + murine acute T-cell lymphoma cells (Luc + LBRM) through tail vein. Mice were treated with one or more daily s.c. injections of 10 \u03bcg VIPhyb. Survival of groups that received 1, 3 or 7 doses of VIPhyb were compared with PBS treated controls. Tumor growth was monitored weekly by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Cytokine expression and expression of immune markers PD-1, PD-1H (VISTA), and PD-L1 on blood and spleen leukocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results Long-term survival (day 80) of tumor-bearing B6 and B10BR mice that received a single-dose of VIPhyb one day before tumor inoculation was 80% for both mouse strains harboring both leukemia cells (p<0.01 vs. control, B6 n=10 and B10BR n=5, Figure 1 ). A single injection of VIPhyb was more effective than multiple doses in achieving long-term tumor-free survival, with 60% survival among C1498-tumor bearing mice (p<0.01 vs. controls, n=5) treated with 3 doses, and 46% survival in mice (p<0.01 vs. control, n=13) with C1498 and 40% survival in mice (p=0.06 vs. control, n=5,) with LBRM treated with 7 doses. None of the control mice inoculated with C1498 (n=21) or LBRM (n=10) that received PBS injections survived to day 55. To explore the therapeutic effect of VIPhyb on established tumors, B6 mice and B10BR were treated with 7 daily doses of VIPhyb starting 8 days or 15 days after inoculation with Luc + C1498 or Luc + LBRM, respectively. Survival of B6 mice bearing C1498 and B10BR mice bearing LBRM that received delayed administration of VIPhyb was 60% (p<0.001 vs. control, n=10) and 20% (p=0.039 vs. control, n=5), respectively, compared with 0 % survival (and faster tumor growth) among control mice (B6 n=10; B10BR n=5) that received PBS injections. Tumor burdens in VIPhyb treated mice measured by BLI showed slower tumor growth, and regression of established tumors compared with mice that received PBS ( Figure 1 ). To elucidate the mechanisms whereby VIPhyb induced anti-tumor activities, expression of serum cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10 and IL-13), expression of co-inhibitory molecules PD-1, PD-1H, PD-L1, and effector molecules Fas-L and granzyme B were measured in T-cells from VIPhyb- and PBS-treated tumor-bearing B10BR mice. Blood and splenic activated (CD62L - CD25 + CD69 + ) and memory (CD62L + / - CD44 + ) CD8 + T-cells from VIPhyb-treated tumor\u2013bearing mice expressed higher levels of IFN-\u03b3, FAS-L and granzyme B, and lower levels of PD-1 (but not VISTA/PD-1H) in activated CD8 + T-cells compared with those from PBS-treated mice ( Figure 2 ). Expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, IL-13, and PD-L1 in blood and splenic dendritic cells were not different comparing with tumor-bearing VIPhyb-treated with PBS-treated control mice.

The mechanism by which administration of a VIP receptor antagonist enhanced anti-tumor immunity includes increasing productions of IFN-\u03b3, and expression of FAS-L and granzyme B in and decreasing expression of PD-1 in activated CD8 + T-cells, leading to enhance anti-tumor cytotoxicity.
