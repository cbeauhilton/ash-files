    "abstract_text": "Abstract 278 Indoleamine 2,3-dioxigenase (IDO) is the rate-limiting enzyme in tryptophan catabolism along the kynurenine pathway. IDO expression by different cell subsets inhibits T-cell activation, proliferation and survival and induces regulatory T cells (Tregs). Although human monocyte-derived dendritic cells have been shown to express IDO, little is known about its expression in other subsets of human DCs, including those generated from CD34 + hematopoietic progenitors (CD34 + -derived DCs). In particular, no data are currently available for IDO expression in CD34 + -derived DC subsets, such as dermal DCs and epidermal Langherans cells (LCs), which are physiologically resident DCs in the skin and act as the main sentinels against pathogens. In the present study, we performed a full characterization of IDO expression and function by human DCs generated from CD34 + cells. CD34 + -derived DCs were generated from purified CD34 + cells after 7 days of culture with GM-CSF and TNF-alpha. In some experiments, day 7-DCs were sorted into different subsets and tested for IDO expression and function. Alternatively, day 7-DCs were cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4 and then matured with a cytokine cocktail of maturation stimuli (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, PGE2). After culture, DCs were analyzed for IDO expression by real-time PCR and western immunoblot, kynurenine production, inhibition of allogenic proliferation and Tregs induction. CD34 + cells did not express IDO mRNA, without significant differences among different progenitor cell sources (cord blood, mobilized peripheral blood, bone marrow). During DC differentiation, IDO mRNA expression was observed at day 7, but not at day 14. At day 14, maturation stimuli induced a marked up-regulation of IDO mRNA and protein, which resulted in increased kynurenine production and inhibition of T-cell proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis of day-7 cells revealed a double population, which comprised CD14 + CD1a \u2212 dermal DCs and CD14 \u2212 CD1a + LCs. Interestingly, IDO mRNA and protein were observed only in dermal DCs, but not in LCs. IDO expression by dermal DCs resulted in increased production of kynurenine and in reduced allostimulatory capacity of T-cell proliferation. Dermal DCs were shown to induce a population of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + which acted as Tregs by inhibiting allogeneic T-cell proliferation. This effect was abrogated by the addition of the IDO inhibitor 1-methyl tryptophan. Interestingly, dermal DCs and LCs showed a differential expression pattern of chemokine receptors. In particular, while both LCs and dermal DC expressed CCR7, CXCR4 expression segregated only in IDO-expressing dermal DCs. These data may correlate to different trafficking features of CD34 + -derived DC subsets and may be associated to IDO expression. In conclusion, DC differentiation of CD34 + cells results in the expression of a functionally active IDO protein in dermal DCs, but not in LCs. Given the role of IDO in regulating immune tolerance, our data may suggest that within the complex skin microenvironment dermal DCs are intrinsically committed to function as regulatory DCs, whereas LCs are devoted to act as activating DCs. These data have implications for a better understanding of the development of the immune response during inflammation/infection. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
