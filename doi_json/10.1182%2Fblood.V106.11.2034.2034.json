    "abstract_text": "Fetomaternal and maternofetal cell transfer have been described. Their clinical relevance is unknown. We hypothesized that firstborn siblings could tolerize their siblings born thereafter through sequential fetomaternal-maternofetal cell transfer. Hence, stem cell transplants within a family from a firstborn sibling (group A) should result more graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and worse overall survival than transplants to a firstborn donor (group B). Results of a retrospective single center cohort analysis of 321 HLA-identical sibling donor hemopoietic stem cell transplants showed a survival of 48.3% (+/\u221210.9%) at 10 years in the group with firstborn donors (group A, 110 patients) as compared to 63.2 (+/\u221210.6%) in the group with firstborn recipients (group B, 105 patients; p<0.02) and a RR of death after adjustment for other risk factors of 2.6 (CI 1.45\u20134.66; p<0.001) for the group with firstborn donors. These results support the concept of a clinically relevant tolerizing effect of birth order, possibly mediated by fetomaternal cell transfer in man.
