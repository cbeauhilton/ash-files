    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3182 Background: Left ventricular thrombus is a potentially devastating complication of anti-phospholipid syndrome (APLS). To date there have been no systematic reviews of this topic. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, ISI, and CINAHL for cases of left ventricular thrombi in APLS. We also included a case seen at our institution. Both English and non-English language citations were included. Keywords included \u201cintracardiac\u201d AND \u201cantiphospholipid\u201d, or \u201cantiphospholipid syndrome\u201d AND \u201ccardiac thrombus\u201d, or in MEDLINE with MeSH operator \u201cantiphospholipid syndrome\u201d AND \u201cthrombus.\u201d A total of 669 citations were found. Twenty-six met our criteria. Result: There are a total of 28 cases of left ventricular thrombus in APLS ( Table 1 ) . The median age was 38 (\u00b115.1 yrs). Fifteen (54%) were women, 12 (43%) were men and 1 was of unknown sex. Five (18%) died, 21 (75%) survived to discharge and 2 (7.1%) had unknown vital status. Nineteen (68%) had a positive cardiolipin antibody, 7 were unknown (25%) and 2 were negative (7.1%). Fourteen (50%) had a positive lupus anticoagulant, and 14 (50%) were unknown. Eight were treated with anticoagulation alone (29%). Of those, 7 recovered (25%) and one was unknown (3.6%). Three (10.7%) were treated with anticoagulation and corticosteroids, and all 3 recovered. In eight (29%), surgical thrombectomy and anticoagulation were utilized. Of the 8 who had surgery, 6 recovered (21%) and 2 died (7.1%). Table 1 \u2013 Summary of cases  Patient Number . Gender .

AC Resolved Case report Legend: M = Male, F = Female, LA = Left atrium, LV = Left ventricle, RA= Right atrium, RV= Right ventricle, SE= Systemic embolic events, CHF=Congestive Heart Failure, FUO = Fever of unknown origin, SLE= Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, TIA = Transient Ischemic Attack, URI/PNA = Upper Respiratory Infection with Pneumonia, Pos = Positive, Neg = Negative, CS = corticosteroids, IgG= Immunoglobulin G, IgM = Immunoglobulin M, S = Surgery to remove thrombus, AC = Anticoagulation, U = Unknown, PP=Plasmapheresis, CVA=Cerebrovascular accident/Stroke, CABG= Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery * Newly reported case from our institution View Large Discussion: In this systematic review we have shown that death may be less common than previously reported (33% [Lim, et. al, Intern Med J. 2004 Mar;34(3):135-7] vs. 18% in our study). A high index of suspicion is warranted. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
