    "abstract_text": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) constitute a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoeitic stem cell disorders. They are characterized by abnormal bone marrow differentiation, peripheral blood cytopenia and a risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The diagnosis of MDS depends on cytomorphology and cytogenetics and may be difficult especially in cases with normal numbers of blasts and without ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow. Cytomorphology is subjective and dysplastic features may be present in other disorders than MDS. In this study we examined the potential of immunophenotyping CD34 + hematopoietic precursors for the diagnosis and classification of MDS. Bone marrow samples of 31 patients with low grade MDS (21 without and 10 with ringed sideroblasts), of 17 patients with refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), of 25 patients with AML and of 39 patients with cytopenia not due to MDS (controls) were examined. CD34 + cells were enumerated and the expression of B cell antigens (CD19), of myeloid antigens (CD13, CD33, CD117) and of immature antigens (CD133) was determined by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was done with a Mann-Whitney test. A high number of CD34 + cells was found in MDS and AML. This was accompanied by an increase of the number of myeloid precursors and a decrease of the B cell precursors. CD117 appeared to be the best marker of myeloid precursors followed by CD13. A wide range of CD34 + CD133 + and of CD34 + CD33 + cells was found in all types of samples. Forty percent of the patients with low grade MDS showed an increased expression of CD117 on their CD34+ cells. In 25% of the cases without ringed sideroblasts a high expression of CD133 was present. Similar changes were more frequently found in RAEB and AML together with an increased expression of CD13 and CD33 and a low positivity for CD19. With a scoring system based on the expression of these antigens 57% of low grade MDS samples (score 1/6 or 2/6) could be distinguished from the controls (score 0/6). An elevated score was also found in respectively 84% and 100% of the RAEB and AML samples. 85% of them even had a score between 3/6 and 6/6. In conclusion, immunophenotyping of CD34 + cells is able to differentiate 60% of low grade MDS samples from other causes of cytopenia. Increased expression of CD117, CD133 and CD34 are the main differences. Similar changes are even more frequently found in RAEB and AML. A scoring system based on the antigen expression on the CD34 + cells is a powerful tool for the diagnosis and classification of MDS.",
