    "abstract_text": "Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPC) are bone marrow derived stem cells that can be extensively expanded in vitro and can differentiate in vivo and in vitro into cells of all three germinal layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm. The origin of MAPC within bone marrow (BM) is unknown. MAPC are believed to be derived from the BM stroma compartment as they are isolated within the adherent cell component. Numerous studies of bone marrow chimeras in human and mouse point to a host origin of bone marrow stromal cells, including mesenchymal stem cells. We report here that following syngeneic bone marrow transplants into lethally irradiated C57Bl/6 mice, MAPC are of donor origin. When MAPC were isolated from BM chimeras (n=12, 4\u201312 weeks post-syngeneic BM transplant from a transgenic mouse ubiquitously expressing GFP), a mixture of large and small GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells were seen early in culture. While the large cells stained positive for stroma cell markers (smooth muscle actin), mesenchymal stem cell makers (CD73, CD105, CD44) or macrophages (CD45, CD14), the small cells were negative for all these markers and after 30 cell doublings, these cells displayed the classical phenotype of MAPC (CD45\u2212,CD105\u2212, CD44\u2212, CD73\u2212, FLK-1+(vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, VEGFR2), Sca-1+,CD13+). In a second experiment, BM obtained one month post BM transplant (n=3) was harvested and mononuclear cells were sorted as GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells and were cultured in MAPC expansion medium. MAPC grew from the GFP-positive fraction. These GFP positive cells displayed the typical MAPC-like immunophenotypes, displayed a normal diploid karyotype and were expanded for more than 50 cell doublings and differentiated into endothelial cells, hepatocytes and neurons. To rule out the possibility that MAPC are the product of cell fusion between a host and a donor cell either in vivo or in our in vitro culture conditions, we performed sex mismatched transplants of female GFP donor BM cells into a male host. BM from 5 chimeras were harvested 4 weeks after transplant and MAPC cultures were established. MAPC colonies were then sorted as GFP-positive and GFP- negative and analyzed for the presence of Y-chromosome by FISH analysis. As expected all GFP-negative (host cells) contained the Y-chromosome whereas all GFP-positive cells (donor cells) were negative for the Y-chromosome by FISH. This proves that MAPC are not derived from an in vitro or in vivo fusion event. In a third study, BM mononuclear cells from mice that had been previously BM-transplanted with syngeneic GFP-positive donors (n=3) were transplanted into a second set of syngeneic recipients (n=9). Two months after the second transplant, BM was harvested and mononuclear cells were cultured in MAPC medium. The secondary recipients also contained GFP-positive MAPC. This is the first demonstration that BM transplantation leads to the transfer of cells that upon isolation in vitro generate MAPCs and, whatever the identity of this cell may be, is eliminated by irradiation. We believe this is an important observation as MAPC hold great clinical potential for stem cell and/or gene therapy and, thus, BM transplant may serve as a way to deliver and reconstitute the MAPC population. In addition, this study provides insight into the nature of MAPC. The capacity to be transplantable within unfractionated BM transplant renders a functional and physiological distinction between MAPC and BM stromal cells. This study validates the use of unfractionated BM transplants to study the nature and possible in vivo role of MAPC in the BM."
