    "abstract_text": "Acquisition of mannosylated glycans in the surface immunoglobulin (sIg) variable region (sIgV) antigen-binding site is a unique tumor-specific structural change of certain lymphomas, including all follicular lymphomas (FL) and ~40% diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Mannosylation of the sIgV allows binding to environmental lectins including DC-SIGN ( Coelho V et al, PNAS 2010 ). SIgV engagement is generally required for survival of DLBCL cells ( Young RM et al, PNAS 2015 ), but how sIgV mannosylation distributes and affects behavior in the two germinal center B-cell-like (GCB-like) or activated B-cell-like (ABC-like) DLBCL subsets is unknown. While the mannosylation of the sIgV is tumor specific and irreversible, there are other natural N-glycosylation sites in the sIg constant region (sIgC). In secreted IgM these are mainly fully glycosylated and that is seen in sIgM of normal B cells ( Krysov S et al, Blood 2010 ). However, engagement of sIgM by anti-IgM leads to expression ofan immature (mannosylated) form in both tumor and normal B cells. This conversion is dynamic, and tumor B cells restore expression of sIgC with mature glycans following BCR disengagement in vitro ( Krysov S et al, Blood 2010 ). In this study, the glycosylation patterns of sIgV and sIgC were analyzed in GCB-like (n=6) vs ABC-like DLBCL lines (n=2) and primary samples (n=8) by IGHV-D-J sequencing, DC-SIGN binding and immunoblot of the biotinylated sIg following digestion by EndoH (specific for the mannosylated sugars) or by PNGase (removes all sugars). We found acquisition of N-mannosylation sequence motifs in the IGHV-D-J transcripts of all GCB-DLBCL lines with t(14;18), indicating a likely relationship with FL. In contrast, neither of the ABC-DLBCL lines had acquired sites, confirming a separate origin. DC-SIGN binding, which is specific for mannosylated IgV structures on the tumor cells, was observed in all GCB-DLBCL and not in the ABC-DLBCL, confirming that the acquired sites were glycosylated. These results allowed us to discriminate DLBCL cases into \"DC-SIGN binders\" (DB-DLBCL) vs \"DC-SIGN non-binders\" DLBCL (NB-DLBCL). Analysis of the carbohydrate structures on the sIgC revealed that the immature form was confined to the NB-DLBCL lines (2/2), while the DB-DLBCL expressed a mature fully glycosylated form (6/6). Consistent with the nature of ABC-DLBCL, these results revealed an activated BCR status of the NB-DLBCL. This was confirmed in the 8 primary samples (5/8 DB, 3/8 NB), which expressed an immature (activated) sIgC in 3/3 NB-DLBCL and a mature sIgC in 5/5 DB-DLBCL. However, engagement of anti-IgM F(ab')2 polyclonal antibody converted the inactive sIg form of DB-DLBCL into an activated sIg with relative increase of the immature sugars. It was evident that the mannosylated sites on the sIgC were not available for DC-SIGN binding, which is confined to the sIgV sites. We verified BCR activation status by investigating constitutive phosphorylation of SYK, BTK and PLC\u03b32, which are recruited to the membrane upon BCR activation, prior to endosome formation ( Phelan JD et al, Nature 2018 ), in 2 DB-DLBCL lines (NU-DHL1 and SU-DHL6) and 2 NB-DLBCL (HBL-1 and TMD8). Basal phosphorylation of SYK, BTK and PLC\u03b32 was higher in the NB-DLBCL, consistent with the activated status associated with an immature sIgC. Our results reveal a functional dichotomy in DLBCL, which indicates: first, the cell of origin dictates whether sIgV carries mannoses in the antigen-binding site; second, reversible sIgC mannosylation associates with activation via sIg. Interestingly, this feature of activation is in ABC-DLBCL, which lacks IgV mannosylation. It is consistent with the suggestion that occupation of the antigen-binding sites with mannoses blocks further engagement of the receptor by 'antigen'. However, acquisition of mannoses in the sIgV sites appears to confer an ability to interact with environmental lectins such as DC-SIGN, whereas the sIgC sites fail to do this, suggesting an alternative function. Clearly, the post-translational modification targets several sites in sIg. Sites in the sIgC have a similar, possibly maturational, function in normal B cells, but in tumor cells the irreversible addition of mannoses to the sIgV adds a tumor-specific function.
