Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have shown promising responses, however, these responses are almost transient in therapy-resistant AML. Here, we show that human mitochondrial NAD(P)+-dependent-malic enzyme 2 (ME2) have significantly increased in CD34+ cell of patients with AML. To determine how ME2 establish metabolic reprogramming of leukemogenesis, we performed a comprehensive analysis of metabolism in CRISPR-mediated ME2 knockout leukemic cells (THP-1 and MV4-11) and purified leukemic blast cells (CD34+) derived from patients with AML. We demonstrate that disrupting ME2 signaling exerts potent activities against proliferation, reduced oxidative metabolism and lactate metabolism. We also show that genetic inhibition of RUNX1/FLT3/ME2 markedly repressed AML cell leukemogenesis. In conclusion, our findings provide a rationale for clinical development of this strategy for treating RUNX1 and FLT3-mutated leukemic patients.
