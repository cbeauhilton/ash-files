    "abstract_text": "Yu-Nan Huang1, Kang-Hsi Wu4, Te-fu Weng4, Su-Ching Liu4, Hui-Chih Hung1*, Ching-Tien Peng4,5* FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are usually associated with other mutations resulting in unfavorable outcome. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have shown promising responses, however, these responses are almost transient in therapy-resistant AML. Here, we show that human mitochondrial NAD(P)+-dependent-malic enzyme 2 (ME2) have significantly increased in CD34+ cell of patients with AML. To determine how ME2 establish metabolic reprogramming of leukemogenesis, we performed a comprehensive analysis of metabolism in CRISPR-mediated ME2 knockout leukemic cells (THP-1 and MV4-11) and purified leukemic blast cells (CD34+) derived from patients with AML. We demonstrate that disrupting ME2 signaling exerts potent activities against proliferation, reduced oxidative metabolism and lactate metabolism. We also show that genetic inhibition of RUNX1/FLT3/ME2 markedly repressed AML cell leukemogenesis. In conclusion, our findings provide a rationale for clinical development of this strategy for treating RUNX1 and FLT3-mutated leukemic patients.
