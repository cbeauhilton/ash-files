    "abstract_text": "Objective: To explore polarization of T lymphocyte and its relationship with apoptosis of marrow cells in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Methods: Measurement of Th1, Th2, Tc1, Tc2 subsets of marrows from 35 patients with MDS and 13 normal controls was performed by flow cytometry. INF-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in the bone marrow serum were tested by ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Furthermore, apoptosis index of marrow cells was detected by TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling). Correlation among Th1, Th2, Tc1, Tc2 subsets and INF-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 level as well as apoptosis index were analyzed, and relationship between TNF-\u03b1, INF-\u03b3 level and apoptosis index was also investigated. Results: The percentage of Th1 cells (10.1\u00b11.5%), Tc1 cells (24.2\u00b13.5%) and Tc1/Tc2 ratio (49.7\u00b110.8) was significantly increased in patients with MDS when compared to normal controls (4.0\u00b10.5%, 5.8\u00b10.6% and 13.4\u00b12.7, respectively). Level of INF-\u03b3 (57.4\u00b121.9pg/ml) and TNF-\u03b1 (14.6\u00b13.7pg/ml) in bone marrow serum of patients with MDS was markedly elevated compared to normal controls (0 and 0.3\u00b10.2pg/ml, respectively). An increased apoptosis index of nucleated cells was also observed in patients with MDS (7.2\u00b11.5%) when compared to controls (2.1\u00b10.3%, P <0.05). The Th1 cells percentage showed a positive correlation with level of INF-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 (r=0.38, P <0.05 and r=0.39, P <0.05, respectively), and also a positive correlation with apoptotic index of nucleated marrow cells in patients with MDS (r=0.33, P <0.05). Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed when the relationship between INF-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 level and apoptotic index of marrow cells were analyzed (r=0.74, P <0.01 and r=0.73, P <0.01, respectively). Th1, Tc1 cells and Tc1/Tc2 ratio in patients with RCMD (according to WHO classification) was markedly elevated ( P <0.01) while not significantly increased in patients with RCMD-RS, RAEB-1 and RAEB-2 when compared to normal controls. An elevation in the percentage of Th1 (11.1\u00b11.9%), Tc1 (25.1\u00b13.8%) and Tc1/Tc2 ratio (58.6\u00b115.8%) was detected in patients with lower-risk (defined by IPSS), while there was no difference between higher-risk group and controls. Conclusions: Th1/Th2, Tc1/Tc2 in bone marrow of patients with MDS were unbalanced, which were polarized to typeIreaction especially in patients with RCMD subtype and lower-risk group. The increased Th1 cells in marrow may account for apoptosis of nucleated marrow cells in MDS, which may act through proapoptotic cytokines such as INF-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1.",
