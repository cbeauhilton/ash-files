    "abstract_text": "Regulated oscillation of protein expression is an essential mechanism of cell cycle control. The SCF class of E3 ubiquitin ligases is involved in this process by targeting cell cycle regulatory proteins for degradation by the proteasome. We previously reported the cloning of NIPA (Nuclear Interaction Partner of ALK) in complex with constitutively active oncogenic fusions of ALK, which contributes to the development of lymphomas and sarcomas. Subsequently we characterized NIPA as a F-Box protein that defines an oscillating ubiquitin E3 ligase targeting nuclear cyclin B1 in interphase thus contributing to the timing of mitotic entry. Using a conditional knockout strategy we inactivated the gene encoding Nipa . Nipa -deficient animals are viable, but show a lower birth rate and a reduced body weight. Furthermore, Nipa -deficient males were sterile due to a block of spermatogenesis during meiotic prophase. Virtually no spermatocytes progress beyond a late-zygotene to early-pachytene stage and reach an aberrant stage, with synaptonemal complex disassembly and incomplete synapsis. Nipa -/- females are sub-fertile with an early and severe meiotic defect during embryogenesis with extensive apoptosis in early prophase (E13.5-E14.5). Here we report, that Nipa -/- meiocytes exhibit persistent cytological markers for DNA double strand break repair proteins (like DMC1, RAD51) in meiotic prophase with more than twice as many DMC1 foci as control animals. Kinetic analysis of the first wave of spermatogenesis showed increased DMC1/RAD51 foci in Nipa -/- cells as soon as early-pachynema cells appear (13-14 days post partum). Moreover, we show that Nipa deficiency does not lead to a defect in meiotic sex chromosome inactivation despite epithelial stage IV apoptosis. Nipa- deficient spermatocytes exhibit numerous abnormalities in staining of chromosome axis associated proteins (like SYCP3 and STAG3) indicating that chromosome axis defects were associated with compromised chromosome axis integrity leading to overt chromosome fragmentation. Further in vitro analyses with bleomycin treated MEFs displayed high pH2AX levels in cells lacking NIPA. Repair of DNA DSB seemed to be abolished in these cells as the pH2AX-level were sustained and still visible after 90 min of timecourse, where wildtype cells already repaired sides of DNA Damage. Consistent with these findings NIPA-deficient spleen cells showed compromised DNA Damage repair measured in a comet assay with a significantly longer olive tail moment in NIPA knockout cells under repair conditions. Taken together, the phenotype of Nipa- knockout mice is a definitive proof of the meiotic significance of NIPA and our results show a new, unsuspected role of NIPA in chromosome stability and the repair of DNA double strand breaks.
