    "abstract_text": "Background: The selective HDAC6 inhibitor ACY-241, a tablet, is structurally related to ricolinostat (ACY-1215), the first agent in this class in the clinic.Ricolinostat, an oral liquid, demonstrated clinical efficacy in a Phase 2 combination with pomalidomide (Pom) and dexamethasone (Dex) in patients (pts) with relapsed or relapsed-and-refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) without toxicities greater than those reported with Pom and Dex alone (Raje et al., EHA 2016, S813). Preclinical data demonstrate synergistic activity of ACY-241 with Pom and lenalidomide (Len) in induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MM cells as well as significant extension of survival in a mouse xenograft model (Niesvizky et al., Blood 2015, 126: 3040). We present updated data on safety and efficacy of the ACY-241/Pom/Dex combination in pts with relapsed or RRMM (ACE-MM-200, NCT02400242). Aims: Determine the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of ACY-241 monotherapy and combination with Pom and Dex and the recommended dose for further development. Methods: Based on clinical experience with ricolinostat and non-clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of ACY-241, we designed a first-in-human phase 1a/1b clinical trial of a single-cycle of ACY-241 monotherapy followed by ACY-241 in combination with Pom (4mg) and low-dose Dex in pts with relapsed or RRMM. The starting dose of ACY-241 was chosen to give similar exposure to the therapeutic dose of ricolinostat (160 mg QD). The trial design was chosen to grant pts access to combination therapy with an active regimen while exploring the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic profile of ACY-241 alone and in combination with Pom/Dex. The PK of Pom and Dex was also assessed. Pts with relapsed or RRMM previously treated with \u2265 2 cycles of Len and a proteasome inhibitor were eligible. Cohorts of 3 pts had ACY-241 PO QD as monotherapy (180, 360 and 480 mg) on days 1-21 of a 28 day cycle. If no DLT was noted in cycle 1 with ACY-241, pts continued to cycle 2 of combo therapy with ACY-241/Pom/Dex. Pharmacodynamic assessments were acetylated tubulin (HDAC6 marker) and acetylated histones (Class 1 HDAC marker) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Results: Since June 2015, 40 pts have enrolled (34 safety-evaluable, 6 had no dosing information in the database). Median age was 62 (34-84) years and median number of prior regimens was 3 (1-7). 90% of pts were refractory to last treatment. 83% were refractory to Len and 50% to both bortezomib and Len. 20% of pts had high risk cytogenetics. No monotherapy DLTs were observed at the highest dose explored (480 mg). Common toxicities in the monotherapy safety population (N=15) were all grade 1/2, except 1 pt with grade 3 anemia at the 480 mg dose level. Toxicities included nausea (4 pts, 27%), anemia (3 pts, 20%), dizziness, fatigue, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (2 pts each, 13%). Doses of 180 mg and 360 mg were explored in combination; one DLT (grade 4 thrombocytopenia) occurred at 360 mg. Common toxicities in the combination therapy safety population (N=33) included neutropenia (13 pts, 40%), fatigue (9 pts, 27%), anemia, leukopenia (6 pts each, 18%), cough, insomnia, rash (4 pts each, 12%), and hyperglycemia (3 pts, 9%). Grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia (10 pts, 30%), leukopenia (3 pts, 9%) and anemia (2 pts, 6%). PK results showed a dose-linear increase in exposure with increasing dose, no accumulation and no drug-drug interaction with Pom and Dex. Selective increase in acetylated tubulin was seen at 180 mg with increasing levels of acetylated tubulin and histones at higher doses. Confirmed efficacy data (median follow-up 3.5 months) for combination treatment (N=22, all refractory to last treatment regimen) shows 1 VGPR, 10 PR, 2 MR and 8 SD and 1 PD. Median PFS and duration of response were not reached at time of the data cut. Given the safety profile, PK exposure (C max ~6 \u00b5M) and PD profile, the 360 mg QD dose level was recommended for further clinical exploration of ACY-241 in combination with Pom/Dex. Summary/Conclusion: ACY-241 is well tolerated in combination with Pom/Dex with dose proportional increase in drug exposure. Early response data to combination treatment parallel those observed with ricolinostat/Pom/Dex and compare favorably to historic controls of Pom/Dex. Cohort expansion at 360 mg ACY-241 with Pom/Dex is ongoing to confirm the dose and schedule for a planned pivotal trial of Pom/Dex +/- ACY-241 and to explore selected biomarkers.
