    "abstract_text": "Background: A role for the Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) in attracting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and infiltrating monocytes has been described for many solid tumors in which they play an essential role in modifying the adaptive immune response, ultimately favoring tumor progression. Unfortunately, little is known about the importance of this mechanism for the progression of AML. We recently identified CCL2 as the most prominent chemokine produced by bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) in response to the interaction with myeloid leukemia cells (PMID: 24599548). In addition, elevated CCL2 plasma levels have been reported in patients of AML (PMID: 17822317), ALL (PMID: 21298741) and CLL (PMID: 22397722) when compared to normal controls. In this study we assessed the effects of blocking the CCR2-CCL2 axis on the migration and signaling of hematopoietic cells as well as on the infiltration of immune-suppressive cells in leukemia-bearing mice. Results : We first studied the efficacy and potency of agents at inhibiting CCL2-mediated migration, using the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. Migration towards human recombinant CCL2 (5 ng/ml) was significantly inhibited by as little as 1 nM of NOX-E36, a human-specific CCL2 Spiegelmer (NOXXON Pharma, Berlin). Spiegelmers are RNA-like molecules built from L-ribose units that are able to bind molecules such as peptides and proteins with an affinity in the pico-to nanomolar range. Similar results were obtained with a CCR2 antagonist (100 ng/ml; Santa Cruz). In anticipation of in vivo studies in mice, we next confirmed the ability of a mouse-specific CCL2 Spiegelmer (mNOX-E36) to inhibit migration and signaling pathway activation in murine hematopoietic cells. For this purpose, we cloned and overexpressed via lentiviral transduction the murine CCL2 receptor (CCR2) in Ba/F3 cells (a murine pro-B cell line). Stimulation of Ba/F3-CCR2 cells with 5 ng/ml of mouse recombinant CCL2 induced a ~2000 fold increase in migration of Ba/F3-CCR2 cells and was successfully blocked with mNOX-E36 in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot analysis of protein lysates from mCCL2-stimulated cells (30 minutes treatment) indicated activation of AKT, ERK and p38-MAPK. The CCL2-induced phosphorylation of these molecules was completely abrogated by pre-treatment with mNOX-E36. Subsequently, we determined whether the expression of CCL2 by stromal cells in leukemia-resident organs triggers the infiltration of TAMs and possibly other immune-suppressive cells into those organs. We conducted preliminary in vivo studies in non-irradiated immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice (n=5 per group) injected with syngeneic AML1/ETO9a-expressing primary murine leukemia cells (PMID: 19339691). After confirmation of leukemia engraftment by IVIS imaging, mice were treated with mNOX-E36 (14.4 mg/kg, s.c., three times per week) or vehicle control for 3 weeks. At this point, all animals were sacrificed and their tissues (spleens and BM from femurs) were collected for analysis. Although we did not observe differences in leukemia burden by imaging between vehicle and mNOX-E36 treated groups, flow cytometry analysis revealed an increase in the frequency of CD11b+ Ly6C low MHC II low macrophages (2 to 7 fold increase) in spleens of mice engrafted with leukemia (vehicle-treated group) when compared to spleens collected from healthy mice. These MHC II low macrophages were previously identified as immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages as opposed to MHC II hi macrophages which show a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype (PMID: 20570887). Importantly, CCL2 inhibitor mNOX-E36 abrogated this macrophage infiltration within the leukemia microenvironment. Conclusions : Our results indicate that blockade of the CCR2-CCL2 axis not only affects migration and signaling of treated cells in vitro , but also interferes with the infiltration of M2-like macrophages into spleens of leukemia-bearing mice. Current in vivo experiments using a combination of standard chemotherapy with mNOX-E36 in AML immunocompetent models are undergoing. We expect that in vivo modulation of CCL2 will improve response to chemotherapy of AML by reducing the marrow infiltration of infiltrating monocytes and tumor-associated macrophages, which would facilitate translation of this novel concept into clinical trials in AML.
