    "abstract_text": "Background: Recently, a high-risk subgroup of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) called Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like ALL was identified in adolescents and young adults. However, there are conflicting data regarding the incidence and prognosis of Ph-like ALL in adult patients, and no data have yet been introduced in Asian countries. Aim: We tried to identify the prevalence and genetic characteristics of Ph-like ALL in adult patients with newly diagnosed BCP-ALL. Furthermore, we analyzed the clinical characteristics, long-term outcomes, and prognostic impact of Ph-like ALL compared with non-Ph-like ALL (Ph-positive ALL or BCP-other ALL). Methods: Between December 2008 and March 2016, 334 adult patients with newly diagnosed BCP-ALL who received modified hyper-CVAD chemotherapy and had suitable material for genomic analysis were included in this analysis (median age, 43 years [range, 16-65 years]). Our post-remission therapy was based on allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) if a donor is available. Ph-like ALL was determined by next generation sequencing using the Archer \u00ae FusionPlex \u00ae ALL Kit (ArcherDX Inc., CO) which can detect fusions, point mutations, and expression levels in 81 genes associated with ALL and additional FISH analysis was done. Results: Overall, 48 (14.4%) of the 334 patients were Ph-like ALL, and the cohort was divided into patients with ABL1 -class rearrangements (n=4), CRLF2 rearrangements (n=11), JAK2 rearrangements (n=4), other JAK-STAT sequence mutations (n=12), and RAS mutations (n=17). The remaining 286 patients had Ph-positive ALL (n=197) and BCP-other ALL (n=89; including 19 patients with KMT2A [MLL] rearrangements). No significant differences in baseline characteristics were observed between the Ph-like ALL and BCP-other ALL subgroups, whereas patients with Ph-positive ALL were older (median age, 47 vs 37 years; p =0.003) and had higher presenting leukocyte counts (median, 33.1 vs 11.4\u00b410 9 /L; p =0.001) compared with Ph-like ALL. The complete remission rate was somewhat different between the 3 disease subgroups (Ph-like ALL, 97.9%; Ph-positive ALL, 95.9%; BCP-other ALL, 88.8%; p =0.027). A higher proportion of patients with Ph-like ALL actually received allogeneic HCT in CR1 than patients with non-Ph-like ALL (Ph-like ALL, 91.6%; Ph-positive ALL, 84.2%; BCP-other ALL, 71.9%; p =0.007). With a median follow-up of 58.1 months (range; 6.0-121.0), outcomes of patients with Ph-like ALL were not inferior compared with outcomes of patients with non-Ph-like ALL. Disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 56.0% for Ph-like ALL, 42.6% for Ph-positive ALL, and 40.6% for BCP-other ALL ( p =0.138). The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse were 19.2% for Ph-like ALL, 35.3% for Ph-positive ALL, and 33.5% for BCP-other ALL ( p =0.076). These findings were maintained when only patients receiving HCT were considered. Within the Ph-like ALL subgroup, patients with ABL1 -class and CRLF2 -rearrangements had worse outcomes than patients with other JAK-STAT sequence and RAS mutations. Also, patients with higher CRLF2 expression had inferior outcomes. Conclusion: Within the limitation of sample size, our data showed a different frequency of subtypes (e.g., lower incidence of CRLF2 rearrangements, higher RAS mutations) and treatment outcomes of adult patients with Ph-like ALL compared with other Western reports. Racial and ethnic differences in the patient population studied may have contributed to these differences. We also suggest that HCT-based post-remission therapy may overcome the poor prognosis of Ph-like ALL.
