    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5179 Introduction: Patients with \u03b2-thalassemia major receive regular blood transfusions. Non-invasive hemoglobin (Hb) estimation may simplify their care. Masimo Pronto-7 Pulse CO-oximetry device is used to non-invasively estimate the hemoglobin level but has not been previously validated in this group of patients. The primary objective of this study was to validate the pulse CO-oximetry based hemoglobin estimation in children and adults with thalassemia major. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study on 108 children and adults with thalassemia major attending the daycare thalassemia center of a tertiary care hospital over 6 weeks. We estimated a spot Hemoglobin (Sp Hb) level using Masimo Pronto-7 Pulse CO-oximetry device (two measurements per patient) and compared it to a venous sample Hb (Reference Hemoglobin; Ref Hb) measured using Abbott CELL-DYN Sapphire hematology analyzer. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination (R 2 ). The multivariable linear regression model of predicting the estimation differences included age, gender, weight, height, blood pressure and reference hemoglobin. Results: We enrolled 108 patients (54 males, 54 females) with a mean age of 21. 6 years (SD 7. 3; 2. 5\u201338). There were 156 estimation episodes. The mean Ref Hb and SpHb were 9. 4 g/dL (SD 0. 9; 7. 1\u201312. 3) and 11. 1 g/dL (SD 1. 2; 7. 5\u201314. 7) respectively. The correlation coefficient between the Sp Hb and Ref Hb was 0. 49 (R 2 = 24%) with a mean difference of 1. 7 g/dL (SD 1. 1; \u22121. 2 to 4. 3). In the multivariable model, Ref Hb level was the only statistically significant predictor of the difference in measurement (p =0. 002). There was a strong correlation between the two CO-oximetry Hb measurements (correlation coefficient 0. 70, R 2 = 50%). Conclusions: Our results indicate that Masimo Pronto-7 Pulse CO-oximetry device overestimates the hemoglobin level and it cannot be recommended for patients with thalassemia major. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these results. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
