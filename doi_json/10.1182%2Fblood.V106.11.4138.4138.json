    "abstract_text": "Sticky Platelet Syndrome (SPS) was first described by Mammen, E., et al. In 1984, is inherited as an autosomal dominant and is associated with both arterial and venous thrombosis. It is also associated with placental vascular thrombosis and resultant recurrent miscarriage syndrome (RMS). It was thought to be of interest to assess the prevalence and types of thrombosis associated with SPS in a strictly thrombosis hemostasis referral practice over a one year period. During 2004, 599 first-time new thrombosis patients were seen, excluding recurrent miscarriage syndrome (RMS). Diagnosis of SPS was by the method of Mammen. Of 599 pts. 20.5% had SPS. The most common defect in the population was antiphospholipid syndrome and Factor V Leiden was seen in 8.5% of all pts. Of these SPS patients 60% suffered arterial (AA) and 39% suffered venous thrombosis. 4 pts. Had both. The types of thrombosis in descending order of prevalence were as follows: DVT = 27.6%, cerebrovascular thrombosis (CVT) = 19.5%, transient ischemic attacks (TIA) = 18.6%, PE = 12.1%, retinal artery thrombosis (RT) = 8.1%, mesenteric AA thrombosis = 7.3%, microvascular peripheral AA = 7.3%, coronary AA = 3.2% and popliteal AA = 0.8%. All pts. Were treated with low-dose ASA and those with CVT or TIA also received clopidogrel (75 mg. /day). At one-year follow-up, no recurrences were seen. In summary: as has been noted by Mammen and others, SPS is a common hereditary thrombophilia associated with arterial and venous thrombosis. The prevalence in this population of first-time thrombosis pts. Was 2-fold that of Factor V Leiden mutation. Thus, a work-up for SPS should always be considered in pts. With unexplained thrombosis.",
