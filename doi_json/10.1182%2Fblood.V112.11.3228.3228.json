    "abstract_text": "Background : Variant Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) translocations frequently involving 1-2 additional chromosomes besides 9 and 22 and represent 5\u201310% of patients (pts) with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The European LeukemiaNet recommendations provide a warning for patients with variant translocations, although there is limited information about their outcome after therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Our prior analysis mostly among pts who had failed prior interferon suggested that these pts had similar outcome to those with classic Ph translocations when treated with imatinib (El-Zimaity et al; Br. J Haematol 2004). Aims : To explore the characteristics and outcome of patients with variant translocations treated with frontline imatinib or 2 nd generation TKI (dasatinib or nilotinib) after imatinib failure. Methods : We reviewed the outcome of all pts with CML treated at our institution in 3 groups: early chronic phase (CP) receiving imatinib as initial therapy, and CP treated with 2nd generation TKI after Imatinib failure, accelerated phase (AP) treated with 2 nd TKI after imatinib failure. Results of pts with variant Ph were compared to those with classic Ph. Results : Among 554 pts (278 CP frontline imatinib, 190 CP post imatinib failure, 86 AP post Imatinib failure) 33 (6%) had variant Ph (21[8%], 6[3%], 6[7%], in each of the 3 groups, respectively). Median follow up is 55 months (mo) (2 \u2013 90), 24 (1 \u2013 53) mo and 29 (5 \u2013 46) mo, respectively, for the 3 groups. Results are summarized in the following tables:  Frontline Imatinib Therapy . Percentage . . . Variant Ph . Classic Ph . P value .

The warning category for these patients may no longer be needed in the era of TKI.",
