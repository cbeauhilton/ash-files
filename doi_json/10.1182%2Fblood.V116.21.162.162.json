    "abstract_text": "Abstract 162 The bidirectional signaling of integrins mediates cell adhesion, spreading, retraction and migration. The binding of talin and kindlins to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin b 3 subunit transmits inside-out signals to induce integrin activation. Ligand-induced outside-in signaling requires the binding of a G protein subunit, Ga 13 , and a tyrosine kinase, c-Src, to the b 3 cytoplasmic domain. It is unclear how the short cytoplasmic domain of b 3 accommodates these molecules and allows coordinated bidirectional signaling. Here we show that Ga 13 and talin are mutually exclusive in binding to b 3 both in vivo and in vitro . Increasing expression level of talin head or full-length talin in CHO123 cell decreases Ga 13 -b 3 association . Ga 13 also competes with talin head for GST-b 3 binding in purified binding system. More importantly, talin is associated with b 3 only in inside-out signaling during platelet aggregation. Following integrin ligation, however, Ga 13 binds to b 3 , replacing talin. The Ga 13 binding site located between K 729 -T 741 within the talin binding region. However, Ga 13 binding and signaling require a distinct ExE 733 motif (EEE in b 3 ) conserved in most integrin b subunits that is not required for talin binding but flanked by talin binding sequences on both sides. Interference of Ga 13 binding to integrin b 3 cytoplasmic domain by myristorylated b 3 peptide (Myr-EEERA 735 ) or by point-mutating the EEE motif to AAA selectively inhibits outside-in signaling, thus inhibited cell spreading on fibrinogen, accelerated RhoA activation and inhibited c-Src activity. But they have no effect on talin-dependent inside-out signaling judged by fibrinogen binding assay. In conclusion, our data suggest that the timed share of binding sites in b 3 between Ga 13 and talin coordinates bidirectional integrin signaling.
