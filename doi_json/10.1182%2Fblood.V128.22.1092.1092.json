    "abstract_text": "Background: Whole genome sequencing has recently shown the presence of recurrent mutations, such as MYD88, CXCR4 and ARID1A, in patients with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM) at diagnosis. Nevertheless, the contribution of each genomic aberration within the clonal evolution of the tumor during WM progression has not been reported. We therefore aimed to investigate whether sequential genomic events sustain WM disease progression by using whole exome sequencing (WES) and targeted sequencing of serial samples. In addition, we investigated if specific genomic alterations can change in response to treatment with samples before and after proteasome or BTK inhibitor treatments. Methods: We have sequenced 74 samples from 32 patients using WES or targeted sequencing technology. DNA was collected from bone marrow CD19-selected cells that were isolated from 6 patients with WM at different stages of disease (2-3 serial samples per patient, total 15 samples), and was subjected to library construction, followed by Agilent Sure-Select Human All Exon v2.0-based hybrid selection. Germline DNA was isolated from matched CD19-depleted peripheral blood samples. All libraries were sequenced with Illumina Hiseq 2500 instrument (New York Genome Center, Rockefeller University, New York, NY). Reads were aligned to GRCh37, and quality control, mutation calling, insertion and deletion identification, copy number variation detection, coverage calculations were accomplished via Firehose at Broad. Somatic Single Nucleotide Variations (SSNVs) were identified and annotated using MuTect and Oncotator, respectively. Insertions and deletions were detected using Strelka. In addition, the deep targeted sequencing was done with a customized bait set in 59 independent serial samples obtained from 26 patients who were treated with either proteasome inhibitor (Pi)- or BTK inhibitor (BTKi)-based therapies in 12 and 14 cases, respectively. Results: Whole exome sequencing, performed at a total average depth of 83X for germline and 85X for tumor samples, led to the identification of average of 14 non-silent mutations per sample (range 2-60). Base conversion signature showed dominant A>C/G transitions. Copy number analysis showed 6q deletion being the most prevalent one. MYD88 was the most recurrent somatic variants in WM patients (>93%), followed by several genes including IRS4, VCAN, CXCR4 and ALDH2, being detected in ~20-30% of the samples. Specifically, changes in the Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF) of these mutations, such as MYD88 and CXCR4, occurred in the serial samples depending on progression and response to therapy. The mutated genes mentioned above, including MYD88, CXCR4, LRG1 and VCAN, were also observed in targeted sequencing of 59 independent serial samples (mean target coverage 434X). CXCR4 was linked to disease progression exposed to Pi or BTK; but not detected in patients responding to therapies. MYD88 was present in patients with either progressive disease or PR/VGPRs. Specifically, different frequencies of MYD88 mutations were identified in patients with progression or PR/VGPR to BTKi-based therapies compared to Pi-based therapies. LRG1 was detected in a patient in response to Pi, while VCAN was observed in both patients showing progression or response to Pi regimens only. Conclusion: These findings reveal the occurrence of clonal variations in patients with WM during disease progression and response to therapies. MYD88 was confirmed to be the most prevalent somatic aberration, and was present in post-treatment samples of progressors and responders to Pi- or BTKi-based regimens. In contrast, mutations in CXCR4 were enriched in patients with WM progressing to either Pi or BTKi therapies. This study demonstrates that WES and targeted sequencing of serial samples of WM patients can detect clonal variations during disease progression.
