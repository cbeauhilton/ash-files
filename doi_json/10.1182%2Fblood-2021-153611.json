    "abstract_text": "Introduction : Severe COVID-19 patients present with a hypercoagulable state, complement activation and endothelial perturbation, which result from an excessive inflammatory response. Thromboinflammation is one important mechanism underlying the COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and the increased risk of thrombosis. Bergamo city is one of the first and most affected area by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the world. For this reason, since the beginning we were actively involved in recruiting convalescent COVID-19 patients, in a program of selection of candidates for convalescent plasma donation. In a large cohort of convalescent COVID-19 patients, we aimed to characterize markers of coagulation activation and endothelial perturbation, in order to explore whether the COVID-19-related hemostasis activation might persist afterwards and evaluate its possible association with the degree of severity of the previous infection, and/or with demographic characteristics, or anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Methods: In 392 convalescent COVID-19 patients (216M/176F, median age: 46 years) plasma levels of fibrinogen, protein C, protein S, factor V, factor VIII, factor XIII, D-dimer, von Willebrand factor (vWF), prothrombin fragment F1+2 were measured at the recruitment, i.e. 1-5 months from recovery. Samples were tested for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including anti-S IgG (Anti-S Ab) and anti-N IgG (Anti-N Ab) antibodies at enrollment and at each scheduled subsequent visits. Results: Levels of fibrinogen, D-dimer, von Willebrand factor, protein S and protein C were significantly higher (p 40 years, and severe form of COVID-19 were identified as independent predictors of high levels of both anti-S and anti-N Ab (p<0.001). Among hemostatic biomarkers, fibrinogen (p<0.01) and vWF (p<0.05) independently predict high levels of anti-S Ab. In particular, vWF levels positively correlated with anti-S Ab levels (vWF-antigen r=0.188; vWF-activity r=0.241 and vWF-RiCof r=0.223, p<0.01). Evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody levels at different time points during follow up revealed that 30% of patients displayed high levels of anti-S Ab until more than 8 months from the end of symptoms. Conclusions : Convalescent patients, with a history of severe COVID-19 had a persistent endothelium activation, despite of disease clinical remission even after 9 months from end of symptoms. Furthermore, fibrinogen and vWF levels predicted high levels of Anti-S Ab. Among demographic characteristics, gender, age and severe disease can be predictors of increased antibody response. These findings suggest that inflammation, coagulation and endothelial dysfunction may persist after recovery and may explain the findings of persistent clinical symptoms reported in these patients after healing from COVID-19.
