    "abstract_text": "ADAMTS13, the von Willebrand factor (vWF) cleaving protease, regulates platelet aggregation and microthrombi formation by cleaving high-molecular weight vWF multimers. It is expressed primarily in hepatic stellate cells, but is also found in endothelial cells. Recently, ADAMTS13 was reported to be expressed and regulated in astrocytes, microglial, neuroblastoma, and adult human brain endothelial cells. Previous in vitro studies by our group with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) showed that ADAMTS13 can promote angiogenesis via upregulating the secretion of VEGF and phosphorylation of VEGFR2, suggesting that ADAMTS13 may also be involved in physiological processes unrelated to vWF cleavage ( Lee, M., et al. Microvasc Res. 2012, 84, 109-115) . Herein, we report an additional possible role of ADAMTS13 secreted by brain tumor cells to modulate tumor cell angiogenesis. Using a human ADAMTS13 immunoassay, we detected ADAMTS13 in U-87 and LN-229 glioblastoma cell lysates, SW-1088 astrocytoma cell lysates, as well as in the supernatants of all cell lines (> 2.0 ng/mL). Co-incubation of U-87, LN-229, and SW-1088 tumor cell conditioned media with recombinant vWF indicated that brain tumor-secreted ADAMTS13 is biologically active in cleaving vWF multimers (measured by ELISA). Secretion of VEGF was upregulated in LN-229 and SW-1088 cell lines by ADAMTS13. 939 pg/mL and 674 pg/mL of VEGF were measured in LN-229 and SW-1088 cell lysates, respectively, after incubation with 100 ng/mL ADAMTS13. Incubation of LN-229 glioblastoma cells with 10 \u2013 500 ng/mL rh-ADAMTS13 or 50 ng/mL VEGF 165 did not affect tumor cell proliferation. No change in tumor cell proliferation was observed when LN-229 cells were incubated with a polyclonal antibody against ADAMTS13 in serum free media supplemented with 10 ng/mL ADAMTS13 or media supplemented with 5% FBS, suggesting that ADAMTS13 secreted by brain tumor cells may be involved in extracellular signaling of endothelial cells. Brain tumor cell secreted-ADAMTS13 induced HUVEC migration in a Matrigel invasion assay. Using a modified Boyden chamber fitted with a Matrigel-coated polycarbonate membrane, LN-229 glioblastoma cells increased HUVEC migration by 83%. LN-229 cells supplemented with 10 ng/mL ADAMTS13 further increased HUVEC migration by 190%, suggesting that tumor cell-secreted ADAMTS13 may modulate EC migration ( Fig. 1 ). Combined with our previous findings suggesting that recombinant ADAMTS13 modulates EC angiogenesis, brain tumor-secreted ADAMTS13 may also be a regulator for tumor vasculature angiogenesis.
