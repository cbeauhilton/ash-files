    "abstract_text": "Abstract 4411 Interest in ex vivo hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion has increased in recent years due to the growing importance of these cells in the treatment of a variety of both malignant and non-malignant diseases. Ex vivo expansion of cord blood-derived cells has been particularly investigated because cord is a valuable and readily available source of HSPCs, yet contains limited numbers of cells in each unit. Despite these efforts, most attempts to use expanded cord blood HSPCs in the clinic have been unsuccessful due to the generation of insufficient numbers of cells with the appropriate phenotype and the ability to function in vivo . In many ex vivo culture systems, HSPCs are cultured as a suspension cells and cultured in the presence of various media additives that act to enhance cell proliferation while reducing differentiation. An often-overlooked factor influencing fate decisions is the interaction of HSPCs with a substrate. In the natural bone marrow microenvironment, HSPCs maintain close contact with a complex network of stromal cells and extracellular matrix, likely indicating that cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions play an important role in maintaining their stem cell phenotype. With the goal of mimicking the bone marrow stem cell niche, Arteriocyte, Inc. has developed a 3-D nanofiber-based cell culture substrate (NANEX\u2122). The functionalized NANEX\u2122 substrate is designed to provide topographical and substrate-immobilized biochemical cues that act in synergy with media additives to enhance HSPC proliferation while minimizing differentiation. Here, we present our recent work towards developing a closed, NANEX\u2122-based platform for large-scale clinical expansions of cord blood-derived CD34+ cells. We demonstrate that NANEX\u2122 expands CD34+ cells from cord an average of more than 150-fold in 10 day culture, which is at least 2-fold higher than that obtained in standard tissue culture plates. Additionally, we show an approximately 1.5-fold higher proliferation of colony forming cells and a significantly higher engraftment rate in NSG mice for NANEX\u2122-expanded cells compared to cells cultured in tissue culture plates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the NANEX\u2122 scaffold maintains its HSPC growth promoting characteristics after processing into a closed culture system and offers significant advantages over other culture platforms typically used for HSPC expansions in the clinic (culture bags and T-flasks). Our data indicates that NANEX\u2122 technology provides a robust ex vivo expansion of cord blood HSPCs and, with further development, offers great potential for clinical applications requiring large numbers of functional cells.
