    "abstract_text": "Background: Despite improved treatment options, indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) remain incurable for most patients. Fenretinide (4-hydroxy(phenyl)retinamide; 4-HPR), an orally bioavailable synthetic retinoid, has been shown to induce apoptotic cell death in a variety of tumor types, presumably via intratumoral induction of oxygen free radicals. Our group has shown single-agent fenretinide anti-B-NHL activity as well as synergy with anti-CD20 antibody therapy when tested in vitro (Shan et al Clin Cancer Res . 2001) and in human xenograft models (Gopal et al, Blood 2004). These preclinical data support the first trial to evaluate this strategy of fenretinide and rituximab in patients with B-cell malignancies. Here we report results from a phase I-II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of fenretinide with rituximab for indolent NHL and MCL. Methods: This was an open-label, phase I/II study conducted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) and Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00288067). The study was approved by the institutional review board at FHCRC and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Major eligibility criteria included: CD20 positive lymphoid malignancy, radiographically measurable disease, ECOG PS \u00b22, and adequate organ function. The phase I portion evaluated the safety of dosing single agent fenretinide at 900 mg/m 2 PO BID for days 1-5 of a 7 day cycle and allowed de-escalation for excess toxicity. The phase II portion added 375 mg/m 2 IV rituximab weekly on weeks 5-9 then every 3 months. All patients could remain on therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response assessment occurred approximately every 3 months. Correlative studies included fenretinide pharmacokinetics, serum retinol concentrations, and evaluation of tumor expression of BCL-2 family proteins. Response was scored by standard criteria (Cheson 1999). Results: Thirty-two patients enrolled in the study: 7 patients in phase I, and 25 patients in phase II. The median age was 64 years (range, 40 - 78), 81% were male, and the median number of prior therapies was 1 (range, 0 - 10) with 22 (69%) having received prior rituximab and 8 (25%) with rituximab-refractory disease. Histologies included 13 CLL/SLL, 10 follicular (FL), 7 mantle cell (MCL), 1 lymphoplasmacytic, and 1 marginal zone. No dose limiting toxicities were observed in the phase I portion, and 900 mg/m 2 was the dose level delivered in combination with rituximab for the phase II component. The most common treatment-related adverse events (AE) of any grade were reversible night blindness (n=18, 56%), other eye disorders (n=17, 53%), rash (n=12, 38%), and photosensitivity (n=8, 25%). The most common treatment related AEs of grade 3 or higher included: maculopapular rash, night blindness, and decreased lymphocyte count. Three patients (9%) discontinued treatment early due to toxicity (rash-2, GI toxicity-1). One patient with MCL in the phase I portion experienced stable disease (SD) lasting 35 months. In the phase II portion of the study, 5 (20%) patient\u00d5s disease responded (Figure), with 2 (8%) achieving complete remission (both SLL/CLL), and 3 (12%) achieving partial remission (2 FL, 1 MCL). In addition 16 (64%) patients had SD. The median progression-free survival was 9 months (range, 6 - 31 months), and the median overall survival was not reached (range, 33 months to not reached). Median time to progression of responders was 14.5 months. The one-month median peak and trough concentrations of fenretinide were 11.45 \u00b5M and 2.5 \u00b5M, respectively. Correlative studies assessing Bcl-2, BAX, and apoptosis in the 13 patients with circulating tumor cells were not able to associate these data with response, or survival. Discussion: In this phase I/II study, the combination of fenretinide and rituximab was well tolerated with predictable, reversible toxicities with up to 4.5 years of continuous therapy. Though the ORR was modest (20%), the majority had of patients had disease control (ORR + SD=84%) which lasted for > 6 months. Further study of this novel combination should focus on identifying the subset of B-NHL that is most likely to respond or the rational addition of other agents to augment these anti-tumor effects.
