    "abstract_text": "A W127X mutation in platelet glycoprotein (GP)IX is the most common genetic defect in Japanese Bernard-Soulier Syndrome (BSS). Patients having this mutation are often misdiagnosed as having immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) because of residual expression of GPIb\u03b1 on the platelet surface. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether the residual amount of GPIb\u03b1 present on the surface of GPIX W127X BSS platelets might be sufficient to support adhesive functions of the GPIb complex. Flow cytometric analysis of platelets from our GPIX W127X BSS patient revealed 7\u201311% of the normal level of GPIb\u03b1 (3,700 receptors/platelet), although the expression of GPIb\u03b1 estimated by western blot analysis was only 1% of normal. Expression levels of other receptors such as GPIIb, GPVI, and \u03b12 integrin were 3\u20134 times higher per platelet than that of normal controls\u2013probably due to the increased size of the BSS platelets. To characterize the ability of GPIX W127X BSS platelets to bind VWF, we evaluated their agglutination in the presence of various concentrations of ristocetin, and found that ristocetin-induced agglutination was absent at 1.2 and 1.5 mg of ristocetin/ml, but present at 2.0 mg/ml. We then evaluated the ability of GPIX W127X BSS platelets to adhere under conditions of flow to immobilized VWF, type 1 collagen, and type III collagen. Whereas platelets derived from a Type I BSS patient having a TGTG deletion within the GPIb\u03b1 gene in which GPIb\u03b1 is completely absent (Thrombosis and Haemost 77:1055,1997) were unable to adhere to immobilized VWF under conditions of high shear, GPIX W127X BSS platelets bound well, demonstrating that the residual amount of GPIb\u03b1 present GPIX W127X BSS platelets is sufficient to mediate adhesion to VWF. Finally, recent studies (J Thromb Haemost 5:797,2007) have shown that platelet adhesion to Type III collagen can be mediated by either interaction of GPIb\u03b1 with VWF, or by interaction of the integrin \u03b12\u03b21 with collagen under high shear flow. In support of this notion, adhesion of GPIb\u03b1 TGTG del BSS platelets to immobilized Type III collagen could be completely inhibited by addition of the anti-\u03b12\u03b21 blocking mAb, Gi9, while adhesion of GPIX W127X BSS platelets to Type III collagen was only marginally affected. Taken together, we conclude that platelets having a W127X mutation in GPIX express residual amounts of functional GPIb\u03b1, and both GPIb-VWF and integrin \u03b12\u03b21-collagen interactions are physiologically important under conditions of high shear stress. Residual expression of GPIb\u03b1 in GPIXW127X platelets, therefore, likely accounts for the relatively mild bleeding phenotype in this variant form of BSS.",
