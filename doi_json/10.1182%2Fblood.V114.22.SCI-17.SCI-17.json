    "abstract_text": "Abstract SCI-17 We have investigated the relationships between lineage-specific gene expression, and total genomic organization during hematopoiesis. First, we determined the linear chromosomal distribution of genes that are co-regulated (identified via microarray analysis) when murine hematopoietic progenitor cells (FDCP-mixA) are differentiated to the erythroid and neutrophil lineages, as well as the organization of all chromosomes (in the form of rosettes) in the three cell types. Our analysis revealed a significant tendency for co-regulated genes to be proximal, which is related to the association of homologous chromosomes and the spatial juxtaposition of lineage-specific gene domains. This led us to hypothesize that the genome\u2014at the level of chromosomes\u2014may self-organize to facilitate coordinate gene regulation during cellular differentiation. We tested this hypothesis by applying the approaches of distance matrices and coupled oscillators to our datasets of gene expression and chromosomal associations from the differentiation of the progenitor to the erythroid and neutrophil lineages. Our analysis revealed that coordinate gene expression undergoes a phase transition\u2014characterized by an increase in entropy\u2014upon commitment of the progenitor. As differentiation continues, there is a gradual loss of entropy, culminating in a highly ordered state in the differentiated cell types. The coregulated gene sets of the semi-ordered progenitor and ordered erythroid and neutrophil lineages are significantly correlated with lineage-specific chromosomal association patterns. Furthermore, by transforming the gene expression networks along the time course to corresponding chromosomal association matrices, we found that chromosomal topologies change dynamically during differentiation but, as with gene expression, result in a more highly ordered state in the differentiated cell types. Our analysis demonstrates that the networks of co-regulated gene expression and chromosomal association are mutually related during differentiation, resulting in the self-organization of lineage-specific chromosomal topologies.
