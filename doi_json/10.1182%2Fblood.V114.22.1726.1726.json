    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1726 Poster Board I-752 The PIM family of serine/threonine kinases are pro-proliferative kinases activated by multiple cytokines and growth factor signaling. The Pim kinases are unusual in that they are regulated primarily by transcription and not by membrane recruitment or phosphorylation like other serine/threonine kinases. Activated cytokine receptors recruit JAKs to induce STAT-dependent transcription of the Pim genes. They are proto-oncogenes and have been implicated in the process of lymphomagenesis and malignant transformation. Pim overexpression has been reported in diffuse B cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, FLT3-mediated acute myelogenous leukemia and prostate cancer. Pim-2 is over expressed in leukemias and lymphomas, whereas Pim-3 overexpression has been observed in melanoma, pancreatic and gastric tumors. The recent reports of elevated levels of Pim-1 expression in human prostate tumor biopsies implicate the Pim family of protein kinases in the progression of human prostate tumors. Further, in transgenic animal models, Pim-1 expression has been shown to be elevated in prostate tumors that are caused by overexpression of the c-myc oncogene. Recent evidence reveals the overlapping and compensatory nature of Pim-1 and Pim-2 phosphorylation and highlights the importance of inhibiting all isoforms. The emerging role of the PIM kinase family in hematological malignancies and solid tumors and the druggable nature of their ATP binding pocket make them attractive targets for anticancer drug development Utilizing a highly distinct molecular scaffold, CX-6258 was developed as a selective and potent small molecule pan-PIM kinase inhibitor. CX-6258 inhibits Pims 1, 2 and 3 with IC 50 values in the low nanomolar range and high selectivity as evidenced in a screening panel of over 100 kinases. CX-6258 demonstrates potent in vitro antiproliferative activity, particularly in leukemia derived cell lines expressing the FLT3-ITD. Moreover, CX-6258 inhibits the phosphorylation of BAD and 4EBP1, known substrates for PIMs 1, 2 and 3. When delivered orally, this pan-Pim inhibitor is well tolerated and demonstrates potent antitumor activity in murine xenograft models of PIM driven cancer. Using CX-6258 as our \u201cpath finder\u201d molecule, we have created four additional unique chemical scaffolds as pan-Pim inhibitors, and certain of these scaffolds can inhibit Pims 1, 2 and 3 in the picomolar range while exhibiting no inhibitory activity of the Flt3 protein kinase. The in vivo and in vitro profiles of these chemically diverse series are indicative of an effective and potent anti-cancer mechanism mediated through the selective inhibition of PIM kinase activity. Together, these findings exemplify that we have created multiple proprietary chemical series of pan-Pim inhibitors exhibiting picomolar potency and high selectivity.
