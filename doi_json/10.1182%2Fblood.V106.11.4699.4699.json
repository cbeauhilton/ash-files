    "abstract_text": "Lymphomas may often present with more than one pathologic type in the same individual. This study assesses the variability of FDG uptake values as determined by SUV\u2019s in various lymphoma subtypes to serve as a platform for differentiating and confirming the pathologic diagnosis in all disease sites. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the PET-CT studies of 184 lymphoma patients at initial staging or at relapse prior to therapy. Lymphoma subtypes were classified according to the WHO classification. SUV\u2019s were obtained in a total of 1120 nodal or extranodal disease sites in 11 lymphoma subtypes. Mean SUV\u2019s were calculated for each lymphoma subtype by dividing the total maximum SUV\u2019s by the number of disease sites in all patients. Consequently, mean SUV +/\u2212 SD and SUV range were determined and correlated with histologic diagnosis as shown in the Table. Results: Results are summarized in Table 1. The highest mean SUV\u2019s were obtained in aggressive non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas (NHL) followed by Hodgkin\u2019s disease (HD) and indolent NHL. Starting from the subtype with the highest mean SUV of the means and in a rank of decreasing order, the subtypes of lymphoma are as follows; Burkitts, DLCL, T cell rich B cell, natural killer T cell, HD, Anaplastic T-cell, mantle cell, marginal zone, follicular, T cell peripheral and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). Conclusions: While SUV\u2019s may be quite variable, a general pattern does exist for each lymphoma subtype. A major discrepancy between the SUV\u2019s and histologic diagnosis should be assessed by repeat biopsy. SUV Distribution Among Subtypes of Lymphoma*  Type of Lymphoma . Patient Number .
