    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3413 Self-renewal \u2013 the generation of daughter cells having the same regenerative properties as the parental cell \u2013 is the defining feature of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Homeobox b4 ( Hoxb4 ) is the key gene shown capable of expanding hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vivo and in vitro . It is imperative to establish a stable Hoxb4 overexpressing transgenic live animal model. Here, using a Cre-loxP system, we established a transgenic zebrafish line that stably overexpressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) \u2013 tagged hoxb4 protein under the control of hemangioblast-specific lmo2 promoter. The results indicate that Hoxb4 favors hematopoietic stem cell development of hemangioblasts in vivo . The mechanisms of Hoxb4 -mediated HSC proliferation and the reason why Hoxb4 overexpression can cause retardation of specific and terminal blood cells in vivo are still unknown. Rap1 belongs to the Ras subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins. Rap1 can regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and adhesion through distinct mechanisms. So we want to know whether Hoxb4 overexpression can influence Rap1b expression. The expression difference of Rap1b in blank control group( Tubegin Wild type), experimental control group ( Tg ( zLmo2:LDL-EGFP )\u00d7 Tg ( zLmo2:Cre )), experimental group ( Tg ( zLmo2:LDL-Hoxb4-EGFP ) \u00d7 Tg ( zLmo2:Cre )) zebrafish embryo were detected by whole embryo in situ hybridization (WISH) with Rap1b antisense mRNA probe. It was found that Rap1b expression was extended from 30 to 36 hour postfertilization(hpf) when Hoxb4 was overexpressed. In the Hoxb4 expressed lines, rap1b was upregulated and strongly expressed in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) at 36 hpf. Then, the EGFP labeled hematopoietic cell in transgenic line were collected with the fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). The Rap1b mRNA expression of sorting cell were compared by SqRT-PCR (Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reaction). The gene expressions of Rap1b was upregulated in Hoxb4 experimental group. These results indicate that Rap1b gene maybe is downstream target gene of Hoxb4 gene in hematopoietic system of zebrafish.
