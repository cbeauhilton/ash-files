    "abstract_text": "Patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have demonstrated unprecedented clinical efficacy in hematological malignancies, leading to durable responses in heavily pretreated patients. Adoptive immunotherapies using T cells redirected against AML cells are being pursued as one option with potential curative intent. However, the development of autologous CAR T therapies presents a significant logistical and clinical challenge in a rapidly progressing disease setting such as AML due to the lag time of cell manufacturing. Additionally, harvesting sufficient numbers of healthy T cells from patients with AML may not always be possible. For these reasons the development of an off-the-shelf CAR T cell product may be of benefit. This work details the preclinical evaluation of ALLO-819, an allogeneic CAR T therapy targeting the receptor tyrosine kinase Flt3 (CD135), an AML target with high prevalence in all AML subtypes and limited expression outside of the hematopoietic tissue. To construct a Flt3 CAR, a panel of high affinity (K D values of 0.19 to 233 nM, determined at 37\u00b0C) fully-human antibodies was generated using phage display technology. Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) recognizing different immunoglobulin domains of the extracellular region of Flt3 were inserted into second-generation CAR constructs and tested for their ability to redirect T cell specificity and effector function towards AML cells. A lead CAR exhibiting minimal tonic signaling and potent antitumor activity in orthotopic mouse models of AML (2.5x10 6 and 1x10 7 CAR T cells for Eol-1 and Molm-13, respectively) was selected for further engineering to incorporate a safety off-switch in cis . To accomplish this, short amino acid stretches mimicking epitopes for the FDA-approved antibody rituximab were inserted between the hinge and target-binding regions of the CAR. The CAR T cell phenotype and antitumor efficacy were not affected by the presence of the off-switch. In the presence of rituximab, Flt3 CAR T cells were efficiently lysed via complement-dependent cytotoxicity (~ 80 % CAR T cell depletion in 3 hours) in vitro and eliminated in peripheral blood and bone marrow of NSG mice (>100-fold and >300-fold, respectively). Allogeneic ALLO-819 Flt3 CAR T cells with a lower risk of TCR-mediated graft-versus-host disease and resistant to anti-CD52 antibody (alemtuzumab)-mediated lysis were generated by disruption of the T-cell receptor alpha chain (TRAC) and the CD52 loci using TALEN \u00ae gene-editing technology. Transient expression of TALEN \u00ae in Flt3 CAR T cells resulted in high-efficiency inactivation of both loci and had no impact on T cell phenotype or antitumor efficacy. ALLO-819 Flt3 CAR T cells co-cultured with primary AML blasts ex vivo displayed target-dependent activation, cytokine secretion and cytotoxic activity. Consistent with previous reports, we detected Flt3 expression on a subset of normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) which also showed susceptibility to CAR T cell cytotoxicity. To evaluate off-tumor effects of Flt3 CAR T cells in vivo , NSG mice were administered T cells expressing a CAR with similar affinity to both mouse and human Flt3. Mouse-cross-reactive Flt3 CAR T cells exhibited off-tumor activity that was limited to a subset of bone marrow multipotent progenitors and correlated with antitumor efficacy. Administration of rituximab led to effective depletion of CAR T cells in peripheral blood that was followed by a rapid repopulation of HSPCs to levels observed in na\u00efve mice. In summary, these results support the development of ALLO-819 Flt3 CAR T as a novel immunotherapy for the treatment of AML.
