    "abstract_text": "Homoharringtonine (HHT) is a plant alkaloid which has been used in China for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia for over 30 years. We present here a retrospective analysis designed to compare the efficacy and toxicity of HHT with daunorubicin (DNR) and idarubicin for the treatment of AML in elderly patients. Fifty-three patients over 60 years with newly diagnosed non-M3 AML between January 1998 and December 2007 were treated with cytarabine (Ara-c, 100mg/m 2 /day for 7 days) in combination with HHT (2mg/m 2 /day for 7 days; HA group; n=19), or DNR (40mg/m 2 /d for 3 days; DA group; n=16), or idarubicin (8mg/m 2 /d for 3 days; IDA group; n=18). In the HA group, 42.1% (8/19) of patients achieved complete remission (CR), 26.3% (5/19) of patients had partial remission (PR). In the DA group, the CR and PR rates were each 18.8% (3/16). In the IDA group, 55.5% (10/18) of patients achieved CR, 5.9% (1/18) patients had PR. The CR and OR rates were not significantly different between the three groups. However, whereas in the IDA and DA groups the early death rate within one month after chemotherapy was 33.3% (6/18) and 23.5% (4/16) respectively, there was no early death in the HA group. The estimated OS (overall survival) times were 23.2\u00b17.9 months, 7.6 \u00b12.1 months, 14.0\u00b13.4 months in HA, DA, and IDA groups (HA versus DA, P = 0.048; HA versus IDA, P = 0.678). The estimated mean disease-free survival (DFS) time of those patients who achieved CR in the HA group (44.3\u00b117.3) were also significantly higher than those in the DA group (7.8\u00b12.7; P = 0.047), and comparable with those in the IDA group (18.0\u00b14.2; P = 0.598). In summary, the response to HA induction therapy was at least equal to that of DA and IDA induction, with relatively mild extramedullary toxicity and lower myocardial toxicity. So HHT is a particularly suitable candidate for the treatment of elderly AML patients."
