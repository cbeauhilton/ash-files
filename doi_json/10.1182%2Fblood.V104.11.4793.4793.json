    "abstract_text": "cAMP-mediated signaling potentiates glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis in lymphoid cells, but an effective means by which to take advantage of this observation in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies has not been identified. The PDE4 enzyme family regulates the catabolism of cAMP to AMP in a wide range of tissues. PDE4 inhibitors have recently been submitted for approval for use in asthma and COPD. In leukemic samples from 11 B-CLL patients, rolipram and RO20-1724, two structurally unrelated PDE4 inhibitors, synergized with either hydrocortisone or dexamethasone in inducing B-CLL but not T cell apoptosis. Dose titration studies demonstrated that addition of a PDE4 inhibitor augmented B-CLL apoptosis even when maximally effective doses of either glucocorticoid were utilized. In five patients so analyzed, 10 uM rolipram augmented the induction of apoptosis by 100 uM hydrocortisone by 40 +/\u2212 18%. Using transient transfection of a GRE-luciferase construct with an Amaxa nucleofector technique, we determined that treatment with PDE4 inhibitors augmented glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated GRE transactivation in primary B-CLL cells. Strikingly, inhibition of PKA with the cAMP antagonist Rp-8Br-cAMPS inhibited glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis by 86 +/\u2212 14% in 6 patients so tested and GRE transactivation by 83% in 8 patients so tested. Similarly, treatment with Ht31 peptide, a 23 residue peptide derived from an AKAP that binds with 4.0 nM dissociation constant to PKA RII subunits, also reduced hydrocortisone-induced transactivation. These studies suggest that PKA activity is required for both the ability of glucocorticoids to induce apoptosis and GRE transactivation in B-CLL cells. CCRF-CEM cells, a well-studied model of glucocorticoid and cAMP-induced apoptosis, differed from B-CLL cells in that stimulation of adenylyl cyclase with the diterpene forskolin was required to increase both glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis and GRE activation, while PDE4 inhibition had no effect. We isolated both dexamethasone-sensitive and dexamethasone-resistant CCRF-CEM clones for these studies and demonstrated that forskolin induced glucocorticoid sensitivity even in the initially dexamethasone resistant clone. 1,9 dideoxyforskolin, a forskolin analogue that does not activate adenylyl cyclase, failed to augment glucocorticoid sensitivity in CCRF-CEM cells. Given the marked discrepancy in the sensitivity of B-CLL cells and CCRF-CEM cells to PDE4 inhibitor-induced augmentation of glucocorticoid apoptosis and GRE transactivation, we next examined the cAMP response and PDE4 isoforms in these two cell types. Inhibition of PDE4 induced cAMP elevation in B-CLL but not CCRF-CEM cells, while forskolin augmented cAMP levels in CCRF-CEM but not B-CLL cells. While rolipram but not forskolin treatment up-regulated 63 and 68 kDa forms of PDE4B (most likely PDE4B2) in B-CLL, forskolin but not rolipram treatment up-regulated 67 and 72 kDa forms of PDE4D (most likely PDE4D1/D2) in CCRF-CEM cells. These studies suggest that PKA is required for and enhances glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in B-CLL by modulating GR signal transduction and that inhibition of PDE4 in the absence of exogenous adenylyl cyclase activation is a clinically tenable means by which to achieve such PKA activation. Clinical trials that examine whether PDE4 inhibitors enhance the efficacy of glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy regimens in B-CLL and other lymphoid malignancies are indicated.",
