    "abstract_text": "Background: Outcomes for patients with ultra-high risk (UHiR) newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) and patients with primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL) remain unsatisfactory with current standard therapies. Traditional comparative trials randomising against a standard of care control arm are thus challenging for patients with UHiR NDMM or pPCL, and novel approaches to address their high unmet need are required. OPTIMUM/MUKnine (NCT03188172) is a 'digital comparator arm' trial for UHiR NDMM and pPCL patients with protocol defined outcome comparison against fully molecularly matched UHiR patients from the near-concurrent NCRI Myeloma XI/XI+ trial, the 'MyXI prior'. We report final analysis of the primary endpoint progression free survival (PFS) at 18 months for patients treated in OPTIMUM with Dara-CVRd induction, V-augmented ASCT and Dara-VRd consolidation, compared to the MyXI prior. Methods: Between Sep 2017 and Jul 2019, 472 patients from 39 UK hospitals with suspected NDMM or pPCL were screened. 107 patients with UHiR NDMM by central trial genetic (\u22652 high risk lesions: t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), gain(1q), del(1p), del(17p)) or gene expression SKY92 (SkylineDx) profiling, or with pPCL (circulating plasmablasts >20%) were identified and recruited to OPTIMUM. Patients received up to 6 cycles of Dara-CVRd induction, V-ASCT, followed by Dara-VRd consolidation 1 for 6 cycles (Cons1), Dara-VR consolidation 2 for 12 cycles and monthly Dara-R maintenance until progression. This is the final analysis of the primary trial endpoint progression-free survival (PFS) at 18 months comparing OPTIMUM with the MyXI prior of patients treated with CRd or carfilzomib-CRd (KCRd) induction, ASCT and R maintenance or observation, using a Bayesian framework. Secondary endpoints include PFS, OS, safety and quality of life. Results: At median follow-up of 27.1 months (95% CI 25.1-29.3), median PFS was not reached for OPTIMUM patients. PFS was superior at the pre-specified time point of 18 months for OPTIMUM patients with an estimate of 81.7% (95% CI: 74.2-89.1) versus 65.9% (95% CI: 57.3-74.4) for the MyXI prior (Figure 1). PFS at 18 months was consistently shorter for both CRd (64.5%; 95% CI: 53.8-75.3) and KCRd (68.3%; 95% CI: 54.0-82.5) treated patients compared with OPTIMUM. There was a 99.5% chance of superior PFS outcome with OPTIMUM therapy compared to the MyXI prior within the Bayesian framework; easily surpassing the 85% pre-specified threshold of sufficient evidence of activity. The difference between trial treatments increased over time: 6 month estimates were similar across all treatment arms with OPTIMUM 95.3% (95% CI: 91.3-99.3), MyXI KCRd 95.1% (95% CI: 88.5-100.0), MyXI CRd 93.5% (95% CI: 88.0-99.0), while 12 month estimates were similar for OPTIMUM with 87.5% (95% CI: 81.2-93.9) and MyXI KCRd 87.8% (77.8-97.8), but lower in CRd 81.7% (95% CI: 73.0-90.3). The majority (94%) of patients who started OPTIMUM Cons1 completed all 6 cycles of therapy. Most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) during Cons1 included thrombocytopenia (27.9%), neutropenia (21%) and infection (19.8%), however, grade 4 events were rare (<5%) for all categories, consistent with previously presented data on induction. We previously reported high MRD-negativity rates of 61% at day +100 post V-ASCT for OPTIMUM, with a lower rate of 40% of patients showing both complete response (CR) and MRD-neg. With further follow-up, CR rate increased to 68.2% (95% CI: 58.5-76.9) at end of Cons1, including virtually all patients with MRD-neg finding post V-ASCT. Conclusions: OPTIMUM demonstrated a clear PFS benefit at 18 months for intensified Dara combination therapy pre- and post-ASCT for UHiR NDMM and pPCL over the MyXI prior. Improvement of comparative benefit over time suggests particular efficacy of Dara-VRd in maintaining responses post ASCT, a key challenge in UHiR MM. This is, to our knowledge, the first prospective digital comparator trial for MM; central screening of an all-comer population combined with robust, detailed molecular matching maintained reliability and limited biases. These results demonstrate a novel framework for accelerated comparative evidence generation for patients with high unmet clinical need.
