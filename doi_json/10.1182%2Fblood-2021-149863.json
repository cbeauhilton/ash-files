    "abstract_text": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is the most common inherited bone marrow failure (BMF) syndrome and is caused by impaired DNA interstrand crosslink repair. FA patients usually develop BMF during the first decade of life, prior to any known exposure to exogenous crosslinking agents. Therefore, endogenous sources of DNA damage likely play an important role in the pathogenesis of FA. We previously identified loss of ALDH9A1 as a significant source of endogenous DNA damage using a metabolism-focused CRISPR knockout (KO) screen. This finding was validated using Jurkat cells as well as human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Here, we present updates of our project. To determine whether endogenous DNA damage was induced by the combined loss of FANCD2 and ALDH9A1, we investigated markers of DNA damage in bulk-edited cells. We found that the numbers of chromosomal breaks, 53BP1 foci, and gamma-H2AX foci were increased in FANCD2-/-ALDH9A1-/- cells, compared with single KO or wildtype (WT) controls, in the absence of an exogenous DNA damaging agent. These findings are consistent with spontaneously increased basal levels of DNA damage in FANCD2-/-ALDH9A1-/- cells. To study in vivo BMF and tumorigenesis phenotypes of ALDH9A1 deficiency in the setting of FA, we generated a mouse model. Fanca-/-Aldh9a1-/- mice showed the lowest frequency of long-term hematopoietic stem cells and lineage-negative Sca-1-positive cKit-positive cells, however the differences were not significant compared with control groups. While we did not observe aplastic anemia or leukemia, we found a higher incidence of solid tumors, most notably ovarian tumors and hepatocellular carcinoma in aged Fanca-/-Aldh9a1-/- mice. This suggests that the level of endogenous reactive aldehydes created by ALDH9A1 deficiency in mouse is not high enough to cause full-blown hematopoietic phenotypes, most likely due to redundant detoxification pathways. However, in tissues where ALDH9A1 is active and non-redundant, the low level of endogenous DNA damage accumulating over time causes solid tumors. To identify the specific reactive aldehydes responsible for DNA damage in ALDH9A1 deficiency, we performed a growth selection screen using FANCD2-/-ALDH9A1-/- cells. We found that the loss of ATP13A3 conferred survival advantage to FANCD2-/-ALDH9A1-/- cells. ATP13A3 transports endocytosed polyamines into the cytosol where polyamines can be metabolized by serum amine oxidases into 3-aminopropanal, a reactive aminoaldehyde. 3-aminopropanal also undergoes spontaneous decomposition to acrolein, a well-known reactive aldehyde carcinogen. Finding that the loss of ATP13A3 rescues that FANCD2-/-ALDH9A1-/- cells indicates that 3-aminopropanal and/or acrolein induces endogenous DNA damage requiring the Fanconi anemia pathway function for repair. Finally, to determine the contribution of ALDH9A1 variants to clinical manifestations of FA patients, we performed targeted sequencing of DNA from FA patients. We identified five missense variants, four of which had high CADD scores (>20). ALDH9A1 cDNA containing missense variants with high CADD scores expressed in ALDH9A1-/- Jurkat cells resulted in lower protein expression than the WT cDNA. Cell culture supernatant from cells expressing the variant cDNAs also had increased aldehyde levels as assessed by fluorometric assays, suggesting decreased enzymatic activity of the variant proteins. The patients with ALDH9A1 missense variants with high CADD scores had either early hematologic onset of FA (n=3; two patients before age 1 and one patient before age 4) or AML (n=1). In conclusion, we showed that the loss of ALDH9A1 generates endogenous DNA damage necessitating the FA pathway for its repair. Synthetic lethality caused by the combined loss of FANCD2 and ALDH9A1 was rescued by the loss of ATP13A3, which suggests that 3-aminopropanal is the culprit aminoaldehyde that accumulates in ALDH9A1-deficient cells and results in DNA damage. Functionally deleterious ALDH9A1 variants were observed in some FA patients with early onset of disease suggesting that ALDH9A1 could be a modifier of FA in humans.
