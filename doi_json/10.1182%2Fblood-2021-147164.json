    "abstract_text": "MLL -rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is characterized by deregulation of the epigenome and shows susceptibility towards epigenetic perturbators such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Hence, HDACs represent attractive drug targets and a variety of small molecule HDAC inhibitors have been developed and evaluated for the treatment of hematological malignancies. However, most broad-spectrum inhibitors, which simultaneously target the majority of human HDAC isoforms, often induce toxicity, especially in combination with other therapeutic agents. Therefore, selective inhibition of only one or two HDAC isoforms may represent a better alternative, provided that disease-specific dependency on specific HDACs has been identified. We examined the effects of shRNA-mediated knock-down of the class II HDACs ( i.e. HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7 and HDAC9) in the MLL -rearranged ALL cell lines SEM and ALL-PO. Except for HDAC9, loss of expression (both on the mRNA and protein level) of all HDACs led to strong reductions in viable cells (0.70 to 0.19-fold; p=0.02-0.0016) in both models due to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, or a combination thereof. Next, we evaluated the in vitro efficacy of a variety of class II HDAC-specific inhibitors on a panel of MLL -rearranged ALL (n=5) using 4-day viability MTT assays. This revealed that the selective HDAC4/5 inhibitor LMK-235 was able to recapitulate the loss-of-function phenotype of HDAC4 and HDAC5. Dose response curves showed complete growth inhibition in MLL -rearranged ALL cell lines (n=5), as well as in primary MLL -rearranged infant ALL patient samples (n=4), with IC 50 values of ~100 nM and 40-100 nM, respectively. Importantly, at these concentrations, LMK-235 hardly affected whole bone marrow samples derived from healthy individuals (n=2), for which IC 50 values were ~1 \u00b5M. To further explore the potential of class II HDAC inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies, we performed a combinatorial drug screen to identify compounds that synergize with LMK-235. For this, a compound library (comprising >200 unique agents) was screened in the absence and presence of varying concentrations of LMK235 in the MLL -rearranged cell line models SEM and ALL-PO. This, and subsequent validation experiments in additional cell line models, revealed that Venetoclax (BCL2 inhibitor), Trametinib (MEK/ERK inhibitor), Ponatinib (multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and Omipalisib (a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) strongly synergized with LMK-235. Average ZIP synergy scores ranged from 10-30, with peak ZIP scores up to 40. Importantly, synergistic effects were consistent over all concentration combinations tested. The addition of 50-100 nM LMK-235 strongly reduced IC 50 values for Omipalisib, Ponatinib and Venetoclax (0.27-fold p=0.003, 0.11-fold p=0.0005, 0.75-fold p=0.0004, respectively) in both models. In preparation to assess the in vivo efficacy of LMK-235 in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models of MLL -rearranged infant ALL, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis was performed in immunodeficient NSG mice (n=5). For this, mice were treated with 20 mg/kg of LMK-235, daily administered via intraperitoneal injections for a total of 29 days. While none of the mice showed signs of toxicity or weight loss, LMK-235 plasma levels were stably maintained at concentrations that are highly effective against MLL -rearranged ALL cells in vitro . Taken together, these data demonstrate that various class II HDAC isoforms are targetable vulnerabilities in MLL -rearranged ALL and that pharmaceutical inhibition of HDAC4/5 by LMK-235 represents an attractive therapeutic option. Moreover, high levels of synergy observed between this HDAC inhibitor and various agents belonging to drug classes already reported to be effective against MLL -rearranged ALL, warrants pre-clinical evaluation in vivo . Currently, the assessment of the in vivo efficacy of LMK-235 monotherapy in MLL -rearranged infant ALL PDX models is in progress, after which promising synergistic HDAC inhibitor-based drug combinations will be evaluated. To determine the additional therapeutic value, the efficacy of LMK-235 and promising synergistic combinations will be evaluated in the background of conventional combination chemotherapy, where PDX models will receive a mouse-adapted version of induction therapy currently applied for treatment of MLL -rearranged infant ALL patients.
