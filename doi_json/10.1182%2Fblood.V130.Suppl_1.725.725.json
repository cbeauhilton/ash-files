    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Recurrent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 mutations are observed in 6-10% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ivosidenib (AG-120), a potent, selective, oral, small-molecule inhibitor of the mutant IDH1 (mIDH1) protein, is a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of patients with mIDH1 AML. Through inhibition of mIDH1, ivosidenib suppresses the abnormal production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), leading to clinical responses via differentiation of malignant cells. AIM: To report safety and efficacy data from the first-in-human phase 1 study of ivosidenib in patients with mIDH1 advanced hematologic malignancies including relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML (NCT02074839). This is the first report of data from the 4 expansion cohorts, with a total of 258 patients treated on study. METHODS: The ongoing phase 1 study assesses the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of ivosidenib in mIDH1 hematologic malignancies. Enrollment was completed on May 8, 2017. During dose escalation, patients received ivosidenib as a single agent orally once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) in 28-day cycles. The MTD was not reached and 500 mg QD was selected as the recommended dose to be tested in 4 expansion cohorts: R/R AML (Arms 1 and 4, where Arm 1 patients are those with relapse after transplantation, second or later relapse, resistance to initial induction or reinduction treatment, or relapse within 1 year of initial treatment, and Arm 4 patients have R/R AML but are not eligible for Arm 1); untreated AML (Arm 2); and other advanced hematologic malignancies including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (Arm 3). Updated safety data will be presented for all patients. Efficacy outcomes will be presented for all R/R AML patients treated at 500 mg QD across the dose escalation and expansion cohorts who received their first dose of ivosidenib at least 6 months prior to the analysis cut-off date of May 12, 2017, as well as for the poorest prognosis Arm 1 subset. Efficacy data for all treated patients from the other expansion cohorts (untreated AML and other advanced hematologic malignancies including MDS) will also be presented. RESULTS: In all, 258 patients (78 in dose escalation, 180 in expansion) were treated with ivosidenib. As of May 12, 2017, 62 of 258 (24%) patients were continuing on treatment. The median duration of exposure to ivosidenib was 3.5 months (range 0.1-33.5). Twenty-two (8.5%) patients discontinued treatment to proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Treatment was well tolerated; the most common adverse events (AEs) (n=258) of any grade irrespective of causality occurring in \u226520% of patients were diarrhea (33%), leukocytosis (30%), nausea (30%), fatigue (29%), febrile neutropenia (25%), dyspnea (24%), anemia (23%), QT prolongation (23%), peripheral edema (22%), pyrexia (21%), and decreased appetite (20%). The majority of these AEs were grades 1-2 and reported as unrelated to treatment. Differentiation syndrome (DS) was observed in 29 of 258 (11.2%) patients, including grade \u22653 DS in 14 (5.4%); study drug was held owing to DS in 11 patients (4.3%), and no instances of DS led to permanent treatment discontinuation or death. The primary efficacy endpoint for R/R AML is the CR+CRh rate, i.e., the rate of complete remission (CR according to modified IWG 2003 criteria plus CR with partial hematologic recovery, defined as CR except absolute neutrophil count >0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L [500/\u00b5L] and platelet count >50 \u00d7 10 9 /L [50,000/\u00b5L]). Among 125 Arm 1 R/R AML patients receiving ivosidenib 500 mg QD across dose escalation and expansion who received their first dose at least 6 months prior to the analysis cutoff date, the CR+CRh rate was 30.4% (95% CI 22.5%, 39.3%), including CR in 27 (21.6%) and CRh in 11 (8.8%) patients. Median duration of CR+CRh was 8.2 months (95% CI 5.5, 12.0), and duration of CR was 9.3 months (95% CI 5.6, 18.3). The overall response rate (CR+CRi/CRp+PR+MLFS) was 41.6% (95% CI 32.9%, 50.8%) (52/125 patients). CONCLUSION: Ivosidenib monotherapy is well tolerated in patients with mIDH1 AML and other advanced hematologic malignancies. In a high-risk, molecularly defined R/R AML patient population with unmet medical need, ivosidenib induced durable remissions and improved patient outcomes. These findings support the role of ivosidenib as an effective, oral, targeted treatment for patients with mIDH1 AML.
