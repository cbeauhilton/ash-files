    "abstract_text": "It has been known that the insertion/deletion mutation of CALR gene is the second deriver mutation in myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) of essential thrompocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). As the molecular workup has been incorporated for the prospective screening and diagnosis of MPN in our Oncology Center. An Egyptian 87 cohort of patients with non-mutated JAK2 (58 ET and 29 MF) were investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a pilot study. We found that 37 out of 87 patients (42%) were carrying CALR mutations (30 out of ET (52%) and 7 out of MF (24%)). Sanger sequencing was used to determine the type of CALR mutations in all positive patients and we found that 13 out of 37 (35%) had type 1/type 1-like and 36 out of 37 (97%) with type 2/type 2-like. This CALR mutation profile in Egyptian patients appear different from the western status as type2/type 2-like is the highest in our patients (97%) versus 35-45% and type1/type 1-like was 35% versus 55-65% compared to western results. Meanwhile, the clinical course and phenotype of our cohort of patients is not similar to that in western as there is no significant difference of overall survival between type1/type1-like and type2/type2-like. This finding might be due to the different environmental and genetic backgrounds of Egyptian population. A part of it might be related to the HCV infection as 12 out of 37 (32%) had HCV infection. Further study is in progress on a large number of patients to correlate that with the clinicopathological status, response to therapy and the mechanistic pathway of oncogenic transformation.
