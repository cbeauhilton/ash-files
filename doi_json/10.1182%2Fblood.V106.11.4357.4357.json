    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) cell interactions with their microenvironment modulate acquired drug resistance and disease progression. Indeed, reported aberrant gene methylation underscores the possible role of epigenetic events in MM\u2019s molecular profile. Membranal tetraspanins are often inversely correlated with cancer prognosis and metastasis, however mutations were unidentified hitherto. Their promoter characteristics and frequent down-regulation conform to transcriptional silencing by chromatin remodeling. We delineated the baseline expression of select tetraspanins in MM cell lines (RPMI 8226, U266, ARP1, ARK, CAG, and EBV transformed ARH77) and fresh bone marrow samples (n=9) for the first time and determined reduced expression of CD9, CD81, and absence of CD82. Thus, we aimed to assess their promoter methylation status. Indeed, we established CD9, CD81, and CD82 promoter methylation in MM cell lines employing: Methyl-specific-PCR of bisulfite modified G-DNA; PCR of G-DNA digested with methylation sensitive restriction enzyme (Hin6I). Re-transcription of assayed genes in the cell lines following demethylation (5-aza-dC) confirmed the mechanistic significance of methylation to their regulation. Combined de-methylation and de-acetylation (TsA) induced synergistic elevation of CD82 mRNA. We conclude that chromatin remodeling contributes to tetraspanin silencing in MM.",
