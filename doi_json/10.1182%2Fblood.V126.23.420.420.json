    "abstract_text": "Glycosylation defects have been associated with low platelet counts. Six genes encoding sialyltransferases (ST), ST3gal1 to 6, that synthesize an \u03b12,3 sialic acid (SA) linkage have been identified in the mammalian genome, and deletion of St3gal1 and St3gal4 genes has been associated with macrothrombocytopenia in mice. Despite the similarity in transferring SA in a \u03b12,3-linkage to terminal galactose residues, St3gal1 and St3gal4 sialylate distinct glycans: St3gal1 is associated with core 1 O-glycan Gal\u03b21,3GalNAc\u03b11-Ser/Thr expression, also known as tumor-associated or Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (T-antigen), whereas St3gal4 sialylates lactosaminyl Gal\u03b21,4GlcNAc N-glycans. It has been previously shown that St3gal4-null platelets are cleared by the hepatic Ashwell-Morell receptor, causing severe thrombocytopenia in these mice. Herein, we generated St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ mice specifically lacking ST3Gal1 in the megakaryocyte (MK) lineage to investigate the detailed mechanisms of macrothrombocytopenia associated with St3gal1 deficiency. Both St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ circulating platelets and bone marrow (BM) MKs had increased T-antigen expression, compared to control, as evidenced by peanut agglutinin (PNA) binding. As expected, other blood cell lineages had no increase in T-antigen expression. Blood platelet counts were reduced by ~50% and platelets were enlarged in St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ mice, compared to control, despite a virtually indistinguishable platelet clearance. BM MK numbers were normal despite the observed thrombocytopenia, BM MK colony forming units (CFUs) were reduced and in vitro proplatelet production was normal in St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ mice, suggesting that extrinsic factors in the St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ BM environment affected platelet production. We hypothesize that recognition of the T-antigen epitope on MKs mediate phagocytosis by macrophages. Macrophages in St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ mice had increased expression of CD68 (macrosialin), indicative of an activated macrophage state. Flow cytometric analysis of BM derived macrophages of St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ mice showed an increased population of resolving M2-type macrophages, which are normally involved in apoptotic cell clearance. Additionally, St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ BM smears revealed increased hemophagocytosis, as evidenced by May-Grunwald/Giemsa, indicative of an unspecific increase in phagocytic macrophages. Macrophage ablation by in vivo injection of clodronate-encapsulated liposomes significantly reduced the numbers of activated macrophages in St3gal1 loxP/PF4+ mice, thereby normalizing blood platelet counts and size. Taken together data show the contrasting effects of different SA loss on platelet homeostasis: Platelets lacking \u03b12,3-linked SA on N-glycans have increased platelet clearance, whereas a lack of \u03b12,3-linked on O-glycans do not affect platelet half-life, but cause defective thrombopoiesis in MKs.
