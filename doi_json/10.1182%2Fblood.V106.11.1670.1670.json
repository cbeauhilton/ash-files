    "abstract_text": "We recently demonstrated that the activity of the PMCA varies greatly among the RBCs in a normal blood sample (Lew et al. , Blood  102 : 4206 , 2003 ). To test the possibility that these variations might be related to cell age, we designed a new experimental protocol to separate RBCs with different PMCA V max , which used glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb) A1c as an age marker for the normal RBCs, and avoided Co 2+ (used in our usual PMCA activity assay) which we found to interfere with Hb A1c measurements: The ionophore A21837 was used to generate a high, rapid and uniform [Ca T ] i in RBCs, which were suspended in a 90mM-K + buffer to prevent RBC dehydration by Gardos channel activation. These RBCs were then washed in high-K + buffer (ice-cold to inhibit the Ca 2+ pump) with 1% albumin to remove the ionophore. At t=0, the washed and packed ionophore-free cells were delivered into 20 volumes of high-K + buffer at 37 o C to initiate Ca 2+ extrusion by the PMCA, and then sampled at 15 sec intervals into 25 vol of an ice-cold, K + -free, isotonic buffer containing 10 mM SCN \u2212 ; these conditions were designed to trap un-extruded Ca 2+ and to elicit rapid dehydration of those cells which had not yet pumped out all their Ca 2+ load. After ~ 40 min at 0 o C each sample was spun; the packed RBCs were resuspended in 10 vol of the same buffer and spun again through diethylphthalate oil (D=1.117 g/ml) to separate the dehydrated RBCs (pellets) from the non-dehydrated cells. The fraction of cells in pellets and on top of the oil was estimated in each sample from Hb measurements, and their Hb A1c content was measured by HPLC. Initially, almost all RBCs, except those with the most vigorous pumps, were recovered in the pellets, but with time, the fraction of cells which had fully extruded their Ca 2+ load and were recovered on top of the oil approached 100%. The progressively smaller pellets contained RBCs with progressively weaker pumps; their Hb A1c fraction increased with decrease in the yield of RBCs in the pellet. This inverse correlation between yield and Hb A1c fraction in the pellets was observed in all six experiments performed with RBCs from four donors. Since the decline in PMCA activity correlated directly with an increase in Hb A1c, the observed population variation in PMCA activity reflects an age-related decline in PMCA activity. Whether this decline is due to progressive glycosylation of of a lysine residue near the catalytic ATP domain on the pump ATPase ( Gonzalez Flecha et al., J Membr Biol  171 : 25 , 1999 ) or to other mechanisms, remains to be determined. The age-decline in PMCA activity may be responsible for the increasing density of aging RBCs, by allowing intermittent episodes of [Ca 2+ ] i elevations in the circulation, with transient Gardos channel activation and gradual dehydration by net KCl and water loss.",
