    "abstract_text": "Abstract 3755 Altered expression, mutation, disruption, or rearrangement of the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/lymphoma 11B gene (BCL11B) has been associated with T-cell malignancies. BCL11B overexpression occurs primarily in T-cell malignancies, suggesting that it may be a target gene for cancer therapy. Our previous study showed that the inhibition of BCL11B expression by siRNA led to apoptosis in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines (Jurkat, huT78, and Molt-4), but not in normal, mature T cells. To confirm the potential of BCL11B siRNA as a therapeutic agent and to determine its safety, the present study further analyzed the effects of BCL11B suppression on hemopoietic stem/progenitor cells, CD34 + cells were collected from three samples of umbilical cord blood using magnetic-activated cell sorting. BCL11B expressions in mRNA level of umbilical cord blood CD34 + cells were analyzed by the real-time quantitative PCR with TaqMan technique. For nucleofection of CD34 + cells, BCL11B-siRNA935 and the U-001 program were used of a Nucleofection Device II. Mock-transfected cells nucleofected without siRNA were used as a negative control. To evaluate the role of differentiation and proliferation in CD34 + cells after BCL11B-siRNA935 transfection, erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E), granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), and megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Meg) from BCL11B siRNA935-, mock-CD34 + cells were performed using methylcellulose assays. Colonies were assessed 14 days after plating. The BCL11B mRNA expression level in the CD34 + cells was significantly lower than that in Molt-4 cells and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from eight healthy individuals. There was no significant difference between BCL11B siRNA935-transfected and mock-transfected CD34 + cells with respect to the formation of BFU-E, CFU-GM, or CFU-Meg ( P > 0.05). We speculate that the BCL11B gene, because of its very low expression level, may not play a major role in proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, but we cannot rule out another anti-apoptotic mechanism. Nevertheless, BCL11B gene silencing alone does not affect the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in vitro. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence for an anti-apoptotic function of BCL11B in T-cell malignancies, but not in hemopoietic stem/progenitor cells, suggesting that BCL11B siRNA is safe and may be considered a new targeted therapeutic strategy for T-cell malignancies. * National Natural Science Foundation(30771980)& Guangdong Science and Technology Project (2007B030703008) Grants Disclosures: Li: National Natural Science Foundation (30771980) and Guangdong Science and Technology Project (2007B030703008, 2009B050700029) Grants: Research Funding."
