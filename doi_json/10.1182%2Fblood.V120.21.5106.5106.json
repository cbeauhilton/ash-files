    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5106 Background: The incidence and biology of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) vary according to age, and the outcome differs amongst children being less favorable in infants and adolescents. Objectives: To analyze the outcome and toxicity patterns of young children with NHL comparing patients aged < 10 years to those 10\u201318 years of age. Methods: A retrospective review of children \u2264 18 years of age diagnosed with NHL over a period of 13 years. Patients were treated according to different protocols and treatment subgroups included: Burkitt lymphoma (BL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Post-organ transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and immunodeficient patients were excluded. Results: From 01/1995 to 12/2008, 173 children with NHL were reviewed. Of these, 81 pts (47%) were <10 years of age, with BL (29 pts), DLBCL (5 pts), PTCL (6 pts), LL (27 pts), and ALCL (14 pts). The 10-year overall survival (OS) was 93. 6+2. 8% in patients aged < 10 years compared to 77. 3+7. 2 in patients 10\u201318 years of age ( P =0. 02). The 10-year event-free survival (EFS) was 89. 4+3. 5% in patients aged < 10 years compared to 70+9. 3% in patients 10\u201318 years of age ( P =0. 03). BL was the most common subtype in patients <10 years, with a 10-year EFS of 96. 4+3. 5% versus 82. 6+7. 9% in patients 10\u201318 years of age ( P =0. 10). The most common subtype in patients 10\u201318 years of age was ALCL (36%), the 10-year EFS was 78. 5+8. 3 versus 92. 9+6. 9 in patients < 10 years ( P =0. 29). Children 10\u201318 years of age were more likely to develop neurotoxicity (9. 7% vs 0%), gastrointestinal toxicity (30% vs 12%), and treatment-related mortality (4. 3% vs 2. 4%). Conclusions: Children < 10 years with NHL have better outcomes and less treatment-related toxicity than older children. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
