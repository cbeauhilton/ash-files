    "abstract_text": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) expressing mixed-lineage leukemia ( MLL )- AF4 , the fusion product of t(4;11)(q21;q23), respond poorly to chemotherapy and have poor prognosis. MLL was required in normal hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation through Hox gene regulation. AF4 is a serine/proline rich nuclear protein with transcriptional activation domain and plays an important role in B and T lymphopoiesis. The MLL-AF4 fusion protein preserves the AT-hook and methyltransferase domains of MLL and the GTP binding, and nuclear localization regions of AF4 . It is still controversial whether the MLL fusion protein is sufficient to induce acute leukemia without additional genetic alterations, although carcinogenesis in general is known to result from more than 1 genetic disorder accumulating during a lifetime. The mutations of FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity are classified into FLT3-ITD or mutations within the activation loop (FLT3-mut), such as FLT3D835V. Recently FLT3-muts are found frequently in infant acute lymphoid leukemia with MLL rearrangements. In the present study, we intended to demonstrate MLL-AF4 fusion protein need activated FLT3-muts for leukemogenetic mechanisms. We successfully established a cell line expressing MLL-AF4 from proB ALL patients with t(4;11)(q21;q23). This cell line expressed CD10 \u2212 CD15 + CD19 + phenotype and overexpressed c-myc by duplication chromosome 8. We have also succeeded to clone cDNA of MLL-AF4 from this cell line, and we got full length FLT3 cDNA from ORIGENE. After making FLT3-ITD and FLT3D835V mutation (FLT3-mut) by site-directed mutagenesis, we used them to confirm leukemogenetic mechanisms. Murine IL3 dependent cell line 32Dc was transduced with lentiviral vector (pCL20c Mp) encoding human MLL-AF4 cDNA (pCL20c CMp+MLL/AF4sEF1a-GFP) and/or FLT3-ITD or -mut (pCL20c Mp+FLT3 EF1a-DsRedExp). After confirming both mRNA expressions by RT-PCR and protein expressions by Western blot, each clone was isolated by FACSVantageSE. First, we examined growth profile under IL3 deprivation in each transduced 32Dc cell lines. 32Dc with FLT3-mut, and MLL-AF4 temporally grew and tended to show anti-apoptotic effect (day 5), but finally did not grow and demonstrated apoptotic cell death (day 10) under IL3 deprivation. By contrast, 32Dc with FLT3-ITD, and MLL-AF4 and FLT3-mut (MLL-FLT3-mut) could permanently grow and tended to show anti-apoptotic effect. We also examined their ability to confer clonogenic growth on 32Dc in semisolid media with presence or absence of IL3. Only 32Dc with FLT3-ITD and MLL-FLT3-mut could form coloies in semisolid media without IL3. Next we examined myeloid differentiation of each transduced 32Dc cell lines in response to granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Stimulation by G-CSF couldn\u2019t promote morphologic differentiation of 32Dc with MLL-FLT3-mut, but promoted 32Dc with MLL-AF4 or FLT3-mut to granulocytes. These results clarify that MLL-AF4 plays an important role in a multi step leukemogenesis. Especially MLL rearrangement plays anti- apoptotic effect and AF4 rearrangement inhibit myeloid differentiation. However FLT3-mut may be necessary and sufficient for secondary genotoxicity on leukemogenesis.",
