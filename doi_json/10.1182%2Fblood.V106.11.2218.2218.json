    "abstract_text": "Neutrophils and monocytes are the main population of peripheral blood nucleated cells and progenies of common progenitor cells, CFU-GM, that are derived from hematopoietic stem cells. Monocytes are non-dividing immediate precursors for macrophages. Common clinical observation that monocytes more rapidly recover than do neutrophils in myelosuppressive patients indicates the difference in regulatory mechanism of terminal differentiation between neutrophils and macrophages. In this study, we investigated the cell division profiles in the differentiation pathway from common progenitors for neutrophils and macrophages to respective post-mitotic cells in culture. We prepared lineage-negative (Lin \u2212 ) bone marrow cells from normal C57BL/6 mice by using immunomagnetic beads. The Lin \u2212 cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE), a cytoplasmic dye that is equally diluted between daughter cells, and stained with anti-Sca-1 antibody and lineage antibodies. CFSE high Sca-1 + Lin \u2212 cells were sorted on a FACSVantage or FACSAria. When the CFSE high Sca-1 + Lin \u2212 cells were cultured in the presence of steel factor (SF) and IL-11 for 5 days, the resulting cells could be separated into four populations based on staining with anti-fms and anti-Gr-1 antibodies: fms - Gr-1 \u2212 , fms + Gr-1 \u2212 , fms \u2212 Gr-1 + , and fms + Gr-1 + cells. The fms + Gr-1 + cells showed morphological features typical of macrophages. The commitment of fms \u2212 Gr-1 + cells into neutrophilic lineage was evident, although they exhibited an immature morphology. CFSE labeling pattern in fms + Gr-1 + macrophages was equal to that of fms \u2212 Gr-1 + neutrophilic cells, indicating that fms + Gr-1 + macrophages and fms \u2212 Gr-1 + neutrophilic cells passed through similar successive rounds of cell division in culture of CFSE high Sca-1 + Lin \u2212 cells. These fms + Gr-1 + macrophages and fms \u2212 Gr-1 + neutrophilic cells were subsequently cultured for additional 3 days in the presence of SF, IL-11, IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, erythropoietin, and thrombopoietin. While a decline in the number of fms + Gr-1 + macrophages was observed, the number of fms \u2212 Gr-1 + neutrophilic cells increased approximately 5-fold during subsequent culture. The proliferation of fms \u2212 Gr-1 + neutrophilic cells and no cell division of fms + Gr-1 + macrophages were confirmed by Ki-67 antibody staining, BrdU incorporation, and DNA staining. The cultured fms \u2212 Gr-1 + neutrophilic cells also predominantly acquired a mature morphology. These results suggest distinct cell division histories between terminally differentiated neutrophils and macrophages, possibly explaining the early appearance of monocytes in the blood after myeloablative therapy, as compared to neutrophils."
