    "abstract_text": "Introduction: Emerging evidence supports that cytogenetic abnormalities (CAs) drive myelomagenesis and heterogeneity (e.g., clinical presentation, response to therapy, and prognosis) of multiple myeloma (MM). Diversity of CAs, including primary (IgH translocations and trisomies) and secondary CAs (copy number abnormalities) argues that MM is not a \"single disease\". Thus, identification of CAs at diagnosis is essential for risk stratification, guiding treatment, and prognostic estimation in daily practice. However, although frequency, configuration, and significance of CAs have been well documented in the Western countries, this information is lacking in the Asian population. To this end, a multi-center retrospective analysis was carried out to examine epidemiology and prognostic significance of CAs alone or in combination in a cohort of Chinese patients with newly-diagnosed MM (NDMM). Materials and Methods: A total of 1015 NDMM patients who had the baseline information of CAs detected by FISH at four institutes nationwide were included. According to the IMWG consensus updated in 2016, 1q gain, del(17p), t[4;14], and t[14;16] were defined as high-risk CAs (HRCAs), while another HRCA t[14;20] was not tested routinely in a majority of these patients. In addition, del(1p) and del(13q14) were considered as an adverse CA. According to the mSMART3.0 proposed by Mayo Clinic in 2018, double-hit (DHMM) and triple-hit MM (THMM) were defined as co-occurrence of 2 or >= 3 HRCAs, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: In this cohort, the median age of 1015 patients was 61 years; 63.5% were male. The type of IgG, light chain, IgA, IgD, non/oligosecretory, IgM, or IgE accounted for 42.9%, 26.2%, 24.5%, 3.4%, 2.5%, 0.4%, and 0.1%, respectively. Del(13q) (46.4%) and 1q gain (46.1%; 3 copies = 73.8%, >= 4 copies = 26.2%) represented the most common CAs, followed by t(4;14) (14.0%), t(11;14) (11.8%), del(1p) (11.5%), del(17p) (9.9%; 20-50% cells = 35.6%, > 50% cells = 64.4%), and t(14;16) (5.1%). While none of these CAs was detected in 23.8% of cases, the frequency of patients who carried 1 - 5 CAs was 31.9%, 28.0%, 13.4%, 2.0%, and 0.9%, respectively. In the 1q+ cases, 36.4% patients carried second CA(s), including del(13q) (61.1%), t(4;14) (20.3%), del(1p) (14.8%), del(17p) (10.7%), t(11;14) (10.4%), and t(14;16) (8.1%). In the del(17p) cases, 57.5% patients had additional CA(s), including del(13q) (75.2%), 1q gain (49.5%), del(1p) (21.6%), t(4;14) (19.6%), t(14;16) (8.7%), and t(11;14) (2.2%). In the cases bearing IgH translocations, 26.0% patients also carried other CA(s), including del(13q) and 1q gain (61.9% for each), and del(17p) (9.3%). In the cases harboring HRCAs, the percentage of patients who carried 1 - 4 HRCAs was 70.2%, 24.8%, 3.7%, and 1.1%, respectively. Overall, 14.3% and 2.9% patients had DHMM or THMM, of whom 65.0%, 18.0%, 12.0%, and 5.0% had 2 - 5 HRCAs, respectively. While there was no significant difference in PFS between the cases carrying 1 and 2 CAs ( P = 0.209), the patients who had 3 or more CAs displayed a sharp reduction in median PFS ( P = 0.022 and P = 0.003 for 3 vs 1 or 2 CAs). Although multiple CAs was associated with shorter median OS, no statistical significance was observed for each comparison ( P > 0.05). However, patients who carried >= 2 HRCAs had significantly shorter median PFS (12.1 months; P = 0.0004) and OS (29.3 months; P = 0.027) than those who had one single HRCA (32.2 and 65.6 months for median PFS and OS). Conclusion: In comparison with the Western countries, the incidence of secondary HRCAs (e.g., 1q gain and del(17p)) is relatively higher in Chinese patients at diagnosis, while the standard-risk CA such as t(11;14) is clearly less frequent. The proportion of Chinese patients who carry multiple CAs (up to 5) or HRCAs appear to be greater as well. In this context, patients carrying two or more HRCAs, so called DHMM or THMM, exhibit significantly worse outcome than those carrying only one HRCA. Together, this study builds up an up-to-date profile of CAs for Chinese patients, which might lay a foundation for revising the criteria for risk stratification and the guideline for treatment that is more feasible and practicable in China. It also provides the information about frequency and configuration of MM-driven CAs, which might be more relevant to the Asian population.
