    "abstract_text": "We tested the effects of Rituximab (anti-CD20) and IDEC-152 (anti-CD23) on apoptosis of B-cell malignancies, using established non-Hodgkin\u2019s B-Cell lymphoma cell lines and freshly isolated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) B-cells. We used monolayers of stably transfected CHO-cells expressing FcR\u03b3III-A to present antibody to B-cells and promote crosslinking. Established B-cell lymphomas (n = 3) were cultured in the presence of FcR\u03b3IIIA-expressing CHO monolayer with or without MAbs and apoptosis was measured by annexin V/propidium iodide staining at various times thereafter. Both antibodies induced time-dependent apoptosis of B-cell lymphoma cell lines. After 48 hrs of treatment with either Rituximab or IDEC-152, the majority of the malignant B-cells were apoptotic (remaining viable cells = 28.7% \u00b1 0.2137% for Rituximab and 30.87% \u00b1 0.7332% for IDEC-152). Rituximab and IDEC-152 also induced marked increases in caspase activity in B-cell lymphoma cell lines, with fold-increases above baseline control cells of 25 \u00b1 0.9031 and 24 \u00b1 0.3839, respectively. In contrast, neither Rituximab nor IDEC-152 induced striking effects on primary CLL B-cells (n = 6). We therefore tested the combination of Rituximab or IDEC-152 with other agents that target anti-apoptotic proteins, exploring whether more efficient induction of apoptosis can be achieved. We cultured lymphoma cell lines and primary CLL specimens with chemical antagonists of XIAP ( Schimmer, et al. Cancer Cell  5 : 25 , 2004 ), an anti-apoptotic protein that inhibits effector caspases. When used at concentrations where XIAP antagonists alone were non-apoptotic (approximately 2.5 \u03bcM), a significant increase in apoptosis was achieved in cultures of lymphoma and CLL cells treated with either Rituximab or IDEC-152. These findings suggest that Rituximab or IDEC-152 may more efficiently induce apoptosis of malignant B-cells when combined with an apoptosis-sensitizing agent.
