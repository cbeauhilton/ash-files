    "abstract_text": "HIb-1 is a single chain antibody (ScFv) originally obtained from the Griffin.1 library. ScFv from this library are derived from the in vitro recombination of germline human immunoglobulin V H and V L chain segments whose diversity has been greatly increased by mutagenesis directed at the CDR3 regions. HIb-1 was selected from the library by sequential biopanning first against CHO cells surface-expressing human GPIb\u03b1, and then against human platelets. Previous studies using Western blot analysis have shown that HIb-1 binds to an epitope within the 45 kDa amino-terminal portion of GPIb\u03b1 (Lapan, Lyle, and Miller, 1999, Thromb. Haemost. 82S:393). HIb-1 displays inhibitory activity against both ristocetin-induced and shear-induced platelet aggregation. Biacore surface plasmon resonance analysis was used to establish dissociation constants between HIb-1and either the extracellular domain of GPIb\u03b1 (i.e., \u201cglycocalicin\u201d or GC) derived from normal human platelets or the CHO-cell secreted GPIb\u03b1 1\u2013483 recombinant extracellular protein. With native GC immobilized on dextran sulfate, the K D for binding by analyte HIb-1 was ~600nM. With the wild-type recombinant GPIb\u03b1 1\u2013483 bound to dextran sulfate, the K D was only slightly higher at ~900 nM. We additionally studied a double mutant increase-of-function GPIb\u03b1 1-483 containing the Gly 233 \u2192Val 233 and Met 239 \u2192Val 239 substitituions. The K D of HIb-1 binding to the double mutant was virtually identical to that of the wild-type, at ~900 nM. Binding of HIb-1 to native GC immobilized in an ELISA assay format was also performed. HIb-1 showed saturable binding, with a half-maximal binding concentration of approximately 170 nM. Flow cytometric analysis was also performed on platelets from murine GPIb\u03b1-null (i.e., \u201cBernard-Soulier\u201d) mice that had been rescued with the human GPIb\u03b1 transgene ( Ware, Russell, and Ruggeri, 2000 , PNAS , 97 : 2803 ), as well as upon normal mice. Murine platelets were gated using a rat anti-murine GPIIb/IIIa antibody. HIb-1 did not bind to normal murine platelets, but showed strong binding to platelets from the transgenic animals, comparable in intensity to that seen with the GPIb\u03b1 mab SZ-2 (for which quantitative bead analysis indicated approximately 8,000 GPIb\u03b1 receptors per platelet). It should be noted that the binding capabilities of HIb-1 to human GPIb\u03b1 are those of a monovalent ScFv molecule of approximately 30 kDa, and may be sufficient for studies of in vivo GPIb\u03b1 inhibition either in the case of acute injury model or of longer-term models involving repeated dosing. Model systems of more chronic inhibition, however, may require conversion of the ScFv into IgG molecules, in order to achieve greater avidity.",
