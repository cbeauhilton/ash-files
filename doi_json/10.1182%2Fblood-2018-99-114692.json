    "abstract_text": "Chromosomal rearrangements resulting in generation of novel fusion oncogenes are common in hematologic malignancies. These disease drivers are key therapeutic targets and form the basis of animal model development for preclinical studies. For example, retroviral introduction of the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) fusion BCR-ABL to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) results in a myeloproliferative disease similar to accelerated-phase human CML when transplanted to recipient mice. This model and many others are established traditionally through retroviral or germline introduction of human fusion oncogenes to the murine genome. Recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9 technology now permit direct editing of the murine genome to create endogenous genotypes that more accurately reflect configurations found in human diseases. To date, these techniques have not been successfully applied to the modeling of fusion oncogene-driven hematologic malignancies. Anaplastic Large Cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma common in adolescents and young adults and driven in ~70% of cases by chromosomal rearrangements involving Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase ( ALK ). Most commonly, t(2:5; p23:q35) fuses the 3' ALK kinase domain to the 5' oligomerization domain of the constitutively expressed Nucleophosmin1 ( NPM1 ) gene. An existing immunocompetent model of ALK+ lymphoma employs a CD4 promoter-driven NPM1-ALK transgene but results in immature T-lymphomas in about two-thirds and B-lineage plasma-cell lymphomas in the rest of animals. We employed CRISPR/Cas9 vectors containing guide strands designed to generate double-stranded DNA cleavage in mouse chromosomes 11 and 17 at breakpoints predicted to generate an in-frame Npm1-Alk fusion oncogene. Wild-type HSCs derived from fetal livers were divided and subjected to either transient CRISPR or mock transfection during a brief ex vivo passage followed by immediate transplantation to sub-lethally irradiated wild-type recipients. Mice initially transplanted with CRISPR-modified HSCs developed an ALK+ large cell lymphoma with a latency of ~9 months, while mock transfected controls sacrificed in parallel were phenotypically normal. qPCR analysis of lymphoid organs from mice that developed disease showed extremely high expression of Alk and Tnfrsf8, which encodes CD30. Pathologically, tumors contained large malignancy T cells with anaplastic morphology. Immunohistochemistry confirmed ALK protein expression, including nuclear localization classic for NPM1-ALK, and intense CD30 cell-surface staining. One recipient instead developed a CD30-negative ALK+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Transplantation of primary T-lymphoma cells to secondary recipients resulted also in ALK+ T-cell lymphomas in recipients with more rapid onset infiltrating lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and other organs. T-cell receptor clonality analyses through \u03b2-chain deep sequencing show an oligoclonal T-cell disease in both primary and secondary recipients. We therefore demonstrate successful genomic editing of transplantable murine hematopoietic stem cells to generate a novel model of a fusion oncogene-driven hematologic malignancy. These methods are widely applicable to additional lymphomas and leukemias and could fuel development of improved in vivo preclinical model systems.
