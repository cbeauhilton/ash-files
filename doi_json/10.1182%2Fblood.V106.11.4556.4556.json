    "abstract_text": "Background: To evaluate the incidence and the outcome of fungal infections in patients (pts) affected by hematological malignancies (HM). Methods: A retrospective study, conducted over 1999\u20132003, in pts with HM, admitted in 18 Italian Hematology divisions in tertiary cares or university hospitals, who developed proven or probable fungal infections. Results: The population included 11,802 pts: 3,012 AML (25.5%), 1,173 ALL (9.9%), 596 CML (5%), 1,104 CLL (9.4%), 1,616 MM (13.7%), 3,457 NHL (29.3%), 844 HL (7.2%). Pts who underwent HSCT were included in a different analysis. A fungal infection occurred in 538 pts, with an incidence of 4.6%; in particular we registered 346 episodes sustained by moulds (incidence 2.9%) and 193 by yeasts (1.6%). The incidence rate depends upon underlying malignancy (12.3% in AML, 6.5% in ALL, 2.7% in CML, 0.6% in CLL, 0.5% in MM, 1.6% in NHL, 0.9% in HL). Among moulds, the etiological agents were Aspergillus (310 episodes, incidence 2.8%), Mucorales (13 pts, 0.1%), Fusarium (15 pts, 0.1%), and other rare fungi (7 pts, 0.1%). Among yeasts we registered septicemia due to Candida (175 pts, 1.6%). Other yeast infections were caused by Cryptococcus (8 pts, 0.1%), Tricosporon (7 pts, 0.1%) and other rare agents (2 pts). We did not observed an increase of A.terreus infections while the number of episodes sustained by A.flavus increased from 1999 to 2003 (RR 2.10; IC95% 0.8\u20135.49; p-value 0.117). The overall mortality rate was 1.8%. Among 538 pts with fungal infection 39% died for this complication, with differences between aspergillosis (42%), zygomycosis (63%), fusariosis (53%) and candidemia (33%). There was not variation in mortality rate during the study period; comparing these pts with those observed in our previous studies during the period 1987\u20131988 we observed a significant reduction of death due to aspergillosis (RR 1.90; IC 95% 1.17\u20133.09), but no differences in mortality rate due to Candida . Conclusions: Our study confirms the general trends already described: infections due to moulds are more frequent than those caused by yeast. Aspergillus remains the main etiologic agent, followed by Candida . The other agents ( Mucorales, Fusarium, Trichosporon ) remain rare. AML represents the most frequently involved category. The mortality rate due to aspergillosis is actually about 40%, with a remarkable decrease when compared to past years; as for candidemia, we observed a reduction in the incidence, but not in the mortality rate."
