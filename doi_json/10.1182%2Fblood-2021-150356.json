    "abstract_text": "Glucocorticoids (GCs) remain a backbone component of therapeutic regimens for childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). GCs resistance is a strong prognostic marker of relapse making its understanding an important challenge to be addressed to improve overall patients outcome. Healthy B-cell development is characterized by checkpoints where critical regulatory signaling influences the fate of developing B-cells. These stages are vulnerable for leukemic transformation and as we previously demonstrated, the developmental and functional state of B-ALL cells are of critical importance in treatment failure. Using this developmental framework, we examined the effect of GCs on healthy and malignant B-cells to better understand mediators of GC resistance and ways to overcome it. To define the dynamics of the transcriptional networks surrounding B-cell developmental checkpoints, we performed transcriptomic analysis of sorted pre-proB, pro-B and pre-B cells from 3 healthy donors. We found a coordinated upregulation of B cell receptor (BCR) and Glucocorticoid Receptor (GCR) pathways in healthy B cells during their development. Single cell proteomic analysis of these healthy populations confirmed the coordinated expression of GCR with early B-cell phenotypic markers. Furthermore, in vitro treatment of healthy B-cells with the GC dexamethasone (dex) demonstrated cycling pro-B/pre-B cells to be the most sensitive to GC-induced cell death. Given the importance of GCs in B-ALL treatment, we investigated GCs effects and resistance in NALM6 and REH cell lines. NALM6, expressing high levels of GCR, were significantly sensitive to dex treatment in terms of cell cycle arrest and cell death. By contrast, REH cells were resistant to dex treatment as they lack the GCR. Retroviral transfection of NR3C1 (GCR gene) in REH cells (REH GCR) resulted in acquired sensitivity to dex. To explore the potential crosstalk between GCR and BCR pathways, we also treated cells with BCR signaling inhibitor, dasatinib (das), alone or in combination with dex. While both cell lines survived to treatment with das, the combined treatment increased apoptosis compared to dex alone in NALM6 cells (p=0.0179) and REH GCR cells (p=ns). Whole transcriptome sequencing of dex-resistant cells revealed upregulation of BCR downstream signaling as one of the main pathways associated with resistance. The cell line data implicated active BCR signaling as a path to GCs resistance, so we next analyzed 19 B-ALL primary samples by mass cytometry, after in vitro exposure for 48 hrs to same treatments. Across the entire cohort, dex induced a significant reduction in viability (p=0.0007), compared to vehicle. Treatment with das and dex+das also decreased cell viability compared to vehicle (p=0.0038 and p=0.0002) although was not significant to dex alone. Interestingly dex-resistant cells showed a phenotypic modulation compatible with a late pre-B phenotype with increased CD45 and CD20 expression. In addition, surviving cells showed an activation of downstream targets of BCR signaling such as pSYK, pRPS6 and pCREB that was partially blunted by dasatinib treatment. To understand whether the phenotype and signaling modulation induced by dexamethasone also occurs in patients after treatment with GCs, we analyzed minimal residual disease (MRD) cells following 8 days of treatment with GCs from 9 B-ALL patients. This analysis confirmed our previous findings with MRD cells having same late pre-B cells phenotype and signaling profile as in vitro treated cells. Finally, we tested whether targeting of pre-BCR signaling via dasatinib, could overcome resistance in vivo . We evaluated engraftment of luciferase-expressing NALM6 cells at different timepoints after tail vein injection in mice treated with vehicle, dex, das or dex + das. Bioluminescence analysis revealed a significant reduction of early and late engraftment in the dex + das group compared to vehicle-treated mice. Furthermore, mice receiving the combined treatment also experienced a significant survival advantage as assessed by log rank test (p=0.0002). Taken together these data suggest a coordinated interplay between BCR and GCR pathways in healthy and leukemic B cells. GCs-resistant leukemic cells showed a mature pre-B phenotype that is vulnerable to BCR signaling inhibition in vitro and in vivo suggesting new therapeutic options to overcome GC resistance in childhood B-ALL.
