    "abstract_text": "Background Cancer patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) or at risk of VTE are treated with antithrombotic agents. Cancer cells express procoagulant properties and induce hypercoagulability in the microenvironment, that could impact the efficiency of the antithrombotic agents. Aims In the present study, we investigated the interaction between antithrombotic agents with pancreatic cancer cells, as well as with their microenvironment. The impact of apixaban, fondaparinux, enoxaparin and tinzaparin on the procoagulant properties of pancreatic cancer cells BXPC3 was examinated. Reciprocally, we also investigated the impact of BXPC3 on the potency of these antithrombotic agents. Methods BXPC3 cells (400 cells/\u03bcl) were exposed for 48 hours to apixaban (2 \u00b5g/ml), fondaparinux (2 \u00b5g/ml), enoxaparin, tinzaparin (2 anti-Xa IU/ml) or NaCL (control). Then, conditioned media (CM) and BXPC3 cells were harvested, separated and put in contact with normal platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Subsequently, thrombin generation (TG) was assessed using Thrombogram-Thrombinoscope\u00ae assay (Diagnostica Stago). Cells' viability was also assessed with the MTT assay. Gene expression for Tissue Factor (TF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Thrombospondin 1 (THSB1) was assessed with RT-qPCR at the cells exposed or not to the antithrombotic agents. Expression of TF protein and activity of cancer cells was assessed using ELISA method. Residual anti-Xa activity in CM was measured using specific amidolytic assays for each antithrombotic agent. Results Apixaban, fondaparinux, enoxaparin, and tinzaparin significantly reduced cell viability by 25%, 12%, 14%, and 11% respectively. In the control experiment non treated BXPC3 cells enhanced TG. Pre-treatment of BXPC3 with the antithrombotic agents did not significantly modify their capacity to trigger and enhance TG. Among the studied agents only apixaban resulted in significant decrease of TF mRNA expression. However, protein expression of TF was not significantly modified by any of the antithrombotic agents. VEGF's mRNA expression was significantly decreased by fondaparinux and enoxaparin. THBS1's mRNA expression was significantly increased by apixaban. The concentrations of the anti-Xa activity of fondaparinux, enoxaparin and tinzaparin in the CM obtained at 48h after exposure of cells were reduced by 27%, 48% and 26% respectively as compared to those initially added in the culture medium. In contrast, the concentration of apixaban in the CM did not significantly change. The CM obtained by cells exposed to apixaban, fondaparinux, enoxaparin and tinzaparin inhibited TG by 70%, 30%, 40% and 90% respectively. Conclusion. Antithrombotic agents reduced the viability of BXPC3 cells. Among the studied agents, apixaban had the most pronounced effect on cells' viability. The antithrombotic agents had a potential downregulating effect on the proangiogenetic properties of BXPC3 via the decrease of VEGF gene expression (fondaparinux and enoxaparin) and enhancement of THBS1 gene expression (apixaban). Nevertheless, preincubation of BXPC3 with the antithrombotic agents did not alter the expression of TF protein and their effect on thrombin generation. Moreover, BXPCE exerted a \"degradation\" effect on LMWH and fondaparinux. Apixaban appeared to escape from this effect of the cancer cells. A significant inhibitory effect on thrombin generation was exerted by the residual concentrations of the antithrombotic agents in the microenvironment of cancer cells. The ensemble of these data highlight for the first time that the presence of antithrombotic agents in cancer cell microenvironment alters the biology of cancer cells and offer a constant antithrombotic effect in the microenvironment.
