However, although injectable prophylaxis options are available and suitable for providing in-hospital and post-discharge prophylaxis, there is often a lack of continuity in VTE post-discharge prophylaxis. This analysis evaluated in-hospital and post-discharge VTE prophylaxis patterns for US medical patients. Methods: Premier's Perspective\u2122 inpatient data were cross-matched at the individual patient level with Ingenix LabRx \u00ae outpatient data from the I3 database (January 2005-December 2007) to assess VTE prophylaxis patterns in medical patients (cancer without surgery, heart failure, severe lung disease, infectious disease) at risk of VTE (according to the American College of Chest Physicians 2004 guidelines) and with no contraindications for anticoagulation. Inpatients were assessed for any anticoagulation received in-hospital and were followed post-discharge to assess their outpatient prophylaxis use. Drug utilization and clinical practice patterns during and within 30 days after hospitalization were collected and compared descriptively between groups. Results: Of the 9,675 medical discharges at risk of VTE and included in this analysis, 6,185 (63.9%) did not receive any anticoagulation at all. Of the remaining 3,490 (36.1%) discharges that did receive anticoagulation, 2,045 (58.6%) received enoxaparin and 1,044 (29.9%) received unfractionated heparin (UFH) (Table). After discharge, 98.2% of all patients did not receive any prophylaxis within the following 30 days. Only 174 (1.8%) discharges received outpatient prophylaxis, with 67.8% receiving warfarin alone and 18.4% receiving enoxaparin and warfarin (Table). Conclusion: This analysis presents both inpatient and outpatient VTE prophylaxis patterns in real-world medical patients that are at risk of VTE. Nearly 64% of patients received no inpatient VTE prophylaxis, and less than 2% received outpatient prophylaxis. Further efforts to improve VTE prevention in hospitalized patients are required, with particular emphasis needed on the transition to outpatient prophylaxis.
