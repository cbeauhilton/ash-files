    "abstract_text": "CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells (Treg) are essential for the maintenance of self-tolerance and have also been implicated in the control of alloreactive immune responses. Several studies using murine models of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) have shown that addition of equivalent numbers of Treg to the donor T cell inoculum at time of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can significantly reduce the incidence of GVHD. In addition, in an MHC-matched, minor histocompatibility disparate model, the infusion of Treg ten days post-transplantation was shown to ameliorate the progression of GVHD while permitting a graft-versus-leukemia effect. However, because Treg constitute <5% of peripheral CD4 + T cells in humans, the use of freshly isolated Treg to treat and/or prevent GVHD, as well as other diseases in the clinical situation, is limited. Therefore, much effort is now under way to expand Treg in order to have sufficient numbers for therapeutic use. There is little available information regarding the repertoire complexity of ex vivo, polyclonally expanded regulatory T cells. We hypothesize that like their CD4 + CD25 \u2212 T cell counterparts, the diversity of the Treg T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire will also be complex. To this end, CD4 + CD25 \u2212 and CD4 + CD25 + T cells from B10.BR mice were purified using fluorescence activated cell sorting; both populations were polyclonally expanded using CD3/CD28 paramagnetic microbeads in combination with high levels (100 IU/ml) of hrIL-2. After achieving a greater than 50 fold expansion, RNA from 1\u20131.5\u00d710 7 cells was isolated for RT-PCR. The complexity of the T cell repertoire of expanded CD4 + CD25 \u2212 and CD4 + CD25 + was determined using TCR Vb CDR3-size spectratype analysis. The PCR products were run on a sequencing gel and analyzed by the GeneMapper Software from Applied Biosystems. This comparison revealed that the number of resolvable Vb families is more heterogeneous in the CD25 \u2212 populations. Whether this reflected a lack of complexity in the regulatory repertoire warrants further investigation. However, for the resolvable Vb families there were no significant differences in the complexity indexes between these two groups."
