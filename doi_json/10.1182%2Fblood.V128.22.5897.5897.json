    "abstract_text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant neoplasm of bone marrow plasma B cells with high morbidity. Clofazimine (CLF) is an FDA-approved leprostatic, anti-tuberculosis, and anti-inflammatory drug that was previously shown to have growth suppression effects on various cancer types such as hepatocellular, lung, cervix, esophageal, colon, and breast cancers as well as melanoma, neuroblastoma, and leukemia cells. The objective of this study was to evaluate the anticancer effect of CLF on U266 resistant MM cell line. The relative cell viability of a panel of hematological cell lines (Jurkat, U266, Namalwa, K562, HL60) treated with 10 \u00b5M CLF after 24 h of treatment significantly reduced the viability in all cell lines, with percentages ranging between 28% (U266) and 38% (Jurkat) (pDepolarization of the mitochondrial membrane is one of the first events in apoptosis. JC-1 is a lipophilic and cationic dye that reversibly changes color from green to red as the mitochondrial membrane potential increases (depolarization). JC-1 assay used in both flow cytometry analyses and fluorescence microscopy images have shown that relative to the control, CLF treatment results in the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane 15, 20.5, 14.3 fold respectively at 12, 24, and 48 h in U266 cell line (Figure 1). The caspase family of cysteine proteases plays an important role in apoptosis. Caspase-3 is a major protease activated during the early stages of programmed cell death. 10 \u00b5M CLF was applied for 12, 24, and 48 h and anti-active caspase-3 PE stained U266 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Caspase-3 activity is enhanced 5.6, 24.5 and 13.6-fold relative to untreated controls at 12h, 24h and 48 h respectively. Phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation to the outer leaflet of the cellular membrane is one of the key steps in early stages of apoptosis. To support our previous findings on apoptotic effect of CLF, we employed Annexin-V assay. CLF treatment caused a significant increase in the percentage of early and late apoptotic cells at 12 h (2.1 and 1.8 fold respectively), 24 h (4.1 and 12.3 fold) and 48 h (10.1 and 11.5 fold). Fluorescence microscopy images also supported flow cytometry data (Figure 2). Collectively, all three apoptosis assay results show that CLF significantly induces apoptosis in U266 cells. Our study is the first to show apoptotic and growth inhibitory effects of CLF on a p53-mutant resistant MM cell line U266. Our results also proved that combined therapy employing CLF together with chemotherapeutics seems to be a possible future therapeutic approach for MM. Further in vivo and clinical studies are warranted to evaluate its therapeutic potential for resistant MM treatment.
