    "abstract_text": "Abstract 1641 Rituximab has proven efficacy and tolerability for treating B-cell malignancies. IV rituximab administration can take several hours, consuming considerable healthcare resources. A SC rituximab formulation has been developed which may shorten administration time, increase patient (pt) convenience, and potentially reduce IV administration-associated costs. Rituximab efficacy depends on CD20 binding, and C trough rituximab levels reflect rituximab exposure throughout the therapy cycle; therefore, achieving a non-inferior C trough level with SC dosing is expected to provide comparable efficacy to IV dosing. BP22333 ( NCT00930514 ) is a two-stage phase Ib study assessing PK and tolerability of SC vs IV maintenance rituximab in pts with first-line or relapsed FL. Stage 1 dose-finding results (Salar et al, ASH 2010, abstract 2858; Salar et al, EHA 2012, abstract 0794) identified a fixed dose of 1400 mg for formal C trough non-inferiority testing in Stage 2. We report Stage 2 data. The Stage 2 objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of simulated C trough of rituximab SC and IV, using a non-inferiority test with a lower boundary of 0.8 for the 90% confidence interval (CI). Secondary endpoints include SC vs IV rituximab safety and area under the serum concentration-time curve. Eligible pts (N = 157) were aged \u226518 years with an ECOG performance status of \u2264 2, and histologically confirmed CD20-positive grade 1, 2, or 3a FL requiring treatment. Eligible pts must have achieved a complete or partial response following IV rituximab-based induction therapy for FL and have received \u22651 cycle of IV rituximab maintenance within 16 weeks of completing induction. Pts (N = 154) were randomized 1:1 to receive SC rituximab (1400 mg) or IV rituximab (375 mg/m 2 ) for their remaining maintenance cycles, stratified by 2-monthly (q2m) vs 3-monthly (q3m) regimen. Study arms were balanced for age, sex, body surface area, FL grade at diagnosis, induction therapy and number of maintenance doses prior to study entry. As of May 11, 2012, 13 SC pts had withdrawn (7 for progressive disease [PD], 4 for AEs, 1 at investigator's decision, 1 for ineligibility) and 17 IV pts had withdrawn (10 for PD, 4 for AEs, 3 for ineligibility). Median treatment duration on-study was 14.8 months (range, 0\u201319) in the SC arm and 13.8 months (range, 0\u201319) in the IV arm. The primary endpoint of the study was met. Geometric mean C trough,SC :C trough,IV ratios were 1.24 and 1.12, respectively, for q2m and q3m, and lower limits of the two-sided 90% CI (1.02 and 0.86, respectively) exceeded the protocol-specified non-inferiority limit (C trough,SC :C trough,IV ratio of 0.8). Therefore, 1400 mg SC rituximab was concluded to be non-inferior to 375 mg/m 2 IV rituximab administration. AE incidence and intensity were generally balanced; 79% of pts in each arm experienced AEs. Serious AEs were observed in 12% and 14% of pts in the SC and IV arms, respectively; none occurred in > 1 pt in either arm. Grade 3/4 AEs occurred in 18% and 17% of pts in the SC and IV arms, respectively; the only grade 3/4 AEs occurring in > 1 pt in either arm were neutropenia (2 pts in each arm) and arthralgia (2 pts in the IV arm). Administration-related reactions (ARRs) were the most frequent AE and had a higher incidence in the SC arm (reported in 31% of SC vs 4% of IV pts). ARRs were mostly local reactions; the most common in the SC arm were: erythema (13%), injection site erythema (5%), and myalgia (5%). Further safety data will be presented. PK data for SC and IV rituximab administration demonstrate non-inferiority of 1400 mg rituximab SC administration to that of the approved IV rituximab maintenance regimen for both q2m and q3m schedules. The overall AE profiles were similar for SC and IV rituximab administration, with the exception of local ARRs, which had a higher incidence in the SC arm compared with the IV arm, reflecting the expected change in the ARR profile with SC administration. Induction and maintenance therapy using the 1400 mg SC rituximab dose is being assessed in the phase III BO22334 study. Disclosures: Salar: Roche: Consultancy.
