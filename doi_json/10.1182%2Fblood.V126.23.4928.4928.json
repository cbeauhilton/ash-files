    "abstract_text": "Background: Effective treatment regimens for FLT3/ITD + AML patients are lacking. Recent data on the effects of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibition showed promising clinical activity, but outcomes have been stunted by drug resistance. Targeting additional signaling pathways besides FLT3 might therefore offer therapeutic benefit. Spleen tyrosine kinase (syk) is frequently overexpressed and constitutively activated in primary AML FLT3/ITD + blasts. Pharmacologic inhibition of syk has been associated with antileukemic potential, consisting of inhibition of cell growth and induction of differentiation in AML cells. Hypomethylating agents (DNMTis) such as Decitabine (DEC) have emerged as attractive agents in the treatment of AML, partially due to their proapoptotic and differentiation inducing effects. There is a strong rationale for combining FLT3- and syk- inhibitors with DNMTis for FLT3/ITD + AML. Here, we investigated whether the antileukemic effects of the novel, dual FLT3/syk inhibitor TAK659 (TAK) can be enhanced by the co-administration of DEC. Methods: Molm14 (M14) cells were incubated in culture medium in the presence and absence of stromal cells (MS5) for 72 hours. TAK or DEC was added in single agent or combined mode at the indicated concentrations. After the incubation period, cell growth was determined by MTT assays. Apoptosis, autophagy and cell cycle status were assessed by FACS analysis. FLT3- and syk- phosphorylation levels were detected by western blotting. Differentiation was assessed by morphology. A combination index (CI) was calculated using Calcusyn Software. Results: TAK exerted dose dependent effects against M14 cells. However, the presence of stromal cells significantly blunted TAK mediated cytotoxicity (50nM: 61.9\u00b11.3% [off stroma] vs. 10.9\u00b13.1% [on stroma], p<.001; 500nM: 91.2\u00b10.5% [off stroma] vs. 17.4\u00b12.5% [on stroma], p<.001, n=3-9; IC50: 40.6nM [off stroma] vs. 3.9\u00b5M [on stroma]). Although less marked when stroma was present, TAK combined with DEC yielded synergistically enhanced growth inhibition (off stroma: 50.2\u00b13.9% [TAK659 50nM], 58.1\u00b13.0% [DEC 1\u00b5M], 76.7\u00b13.1% [TAK659 50nM+DEC 1\u00b5M; CI=0.77]; on stroma: 9.5\u00b13.0%[TAK659 50nM], 42.9\u00b13.1% [DEC1\u00b5M], 57.0\u00b15.2%[TAK659 50nM+DEC 1\u00b5M; CI=0.62]) compared to single agent treatment (off stroma: p<.001 vs. TAK, p< .001 vs. DEC, on stroma: p<.001 vs.TAK, p=.03 vs. DEC, n=3). In line with these findings, combined treatment yielded greater levels of FLT3- and syk- dephosphorylation compared to single agent treatment both when stroma was present and absent. When compared to untreated controls (11.6\u00b10.7%), Annexin V/PI staining (n=3) showed that induction of apoptosis was increased with TAK (18.9\u00b13.9%; p=NS), DEC (39.2\u00b14.8%; p<.01), and greatest when the two drugs were combined (44.2\u00b16.7%; p<.01) in the absence stoma. In the presence of stroma, single agent DEC, and when combined with TAK, increased the fraction of apoptotic cells by up to two fold whereas TAK did not induce any meaningful apoptosis. Consistent with the induction of cell death, cell cycle analysis demonstrated the greatest increase in subG0 phase when TAK and DEC were combined. Both in the presence and absence of stroma, autophagic flux was increased when M14 cells were treated with DEC, and when DEC was combined with TAK whereas no difference was observed with TAK alone. The combination of TAK and DEC led to changes consistent with differentiation, as shown by more abundant cytoplasm and nuclei with deep indentations, folds and lobulation compared to untreated cells. DEC treated cells also showed signs of differentiation although these changes were less marked. No evidence of differentiation was observed in M14 cells when treated with TAK alone. Conclusions: 1. Stroma conferred protective effects against all treatments. 2. TAK exerted dose dependent cytotoxicity against M14 cells in the nanomolar to low micromolar range in the absence and presence of stroma, respectively. 3. The cytotoxic effects of TAK were enhanced when TAK was combined with DEC. 4. The antileukemic effects of TAK combined with DEC are multifaceted and include inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, autophagy and differentiation. 5. The combination of TAK and DEC represents a potentially important novel approach for FLT3/ITD + AML patients. 6. Clinical trials incorporating syk-inhibitors into standard AML treatment protocols are currently under way. Disclosures Dos Santos: Amgen: Employment."
