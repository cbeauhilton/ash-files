    "abstract_text": "Sezary Syndrome (SS) is a rare form of Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) characterised by a distinct metastatic pattern mainly involving skin and blood. Chemokine and chemokine receptors have been implicated in the spreading process of many cancers including various forms of non-Hodgkin T-cell lymphomas (NHL). In this study we report that chemokine receptor CXCR4 is over-expressed by both circulating and skin-homing neoplastic T-lymphocytes of SS patients and is functionally active as demonstrated by the migration of freshly isolated Sezary (SzS) cells along the chemical gradient of its natural ligand SDF-1. To shed light on the regulation of CXCR4/SDF1 interaction, we also investigated the enzymatic activity of CD26/dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV) since SDF-1 is efficiently inactivated by CD26, in physiological condition.. This is of particular relevance because one of the hallmark of the circulating SzS cells is the loss of CD26 from the cell surface. We first demonstrated that the CD26 negative phenotype is similarly maintained also in the skin-homing neoplastic T lymphocytes; we then observed that the addition of exogenus soluble CD26 reduces the migratory response of SS cells to SDF-1 whereas the inhibition of the CD26 peptidase activity in Hut78, a CD26-positive CTCL cell line, enhances the SDF-1-induced migration of these cells. We finally showed that SS individuals exhibit a reduced activity of the soluble CD26 as revealed by the measurements performed on the patients derived plasma. Our findings suggest that the SDF-1-CXCR4 axis could play an important role in skin homing of SS through the regulatory activity of CD26."
