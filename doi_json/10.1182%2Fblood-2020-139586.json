    "abstract_text": "Background . Recently a novel bifunctional antibody (emicizumab) that binds both factor IXa and factor X has been used to treat hemophilia A. Emicizumab has proven remarkably effective as a prophylactic treatment for hemophilia A; however there are patients that still experience bleeding. An approach to treating this bleeding in hemophilia A patients with inhibitors is to give an activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC; FEIBA) (disfavored in NHF MASAC #255). APCC contains a number of coaguation factors including prothrombin, factor X (FX), and factor IX (FIX). APCC also contains activated factor X (FXa) and factor IX (FIXa). Previous work has shown that when APCCs are added to hemophilia A plasma containing emicizumab there is a significant increase in thrombin generation [J Thromb Haemost 2018;16:1580-1591]. The goal of this work was to study thrombin generation in hemophilia A plasma with emicizumab and to examine the role of the zymogen and activated components of an APCC in the increased thrombin generation. Methods . In hemophilia A plasma, thrombin generation assays were done using 100 \u00b5M lipid and 420 \u00b5M Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC with or without emicizumab at 55 \u00b5g/mL which is the clinical steady state level. The reactions were initiated with low (1 pM) tissue factor (TF). The components of APCC were studied at concentrations that should mimic the levels seen in the plasma of a patient given a dose of 50 U/kg: prothrombin 1800 nM; FX 130 nM; FIX 90 nM; and FIXa 0.4 nM. Results . When initiated with low TF, hemophilia A plasma alone had essentially no thrombin generation. As expected, adding emicizumab enhanced thrombin generation. The addition of zymogen coagulation factors, prothrombin, FIX, and FX, separately or together gave a small increase in thrombin generation. However, addition of FIXa to emicizumab gave a large increase in peak thrombin. In hemophilia A plasma with emicizumab and FIXa, addition of prothrombin further increased thrombin generation and specifically increased the peak level of thrombin. Further addition of FX or FIX, separately or together, only minimally increased thrombin generation. Discussion . The strong contribution of factor IXa to the effects of APCCs on thrombin generation in hemophilia A plasma depends on the presence of emicizumab. In the absence of emicizumab, a study of the individual components of APCC showed that a combination of FXa and prothrombin at levels found in APCCs had the major effect on thrombin generation [Haemophilia. 2016;22:615-24]. That study found that FIXa did not increase thrombin generation. However, in the presence of emicizumab, despite the weak solution phase affinity of the bifunctional antibody for FIXa, small amounts of FIXa were the most significant contributor to thrombin generation.
