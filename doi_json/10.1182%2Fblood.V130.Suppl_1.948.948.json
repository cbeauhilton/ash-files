    "abstract_text": "Bone marrow (BM) contains a population of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) that, together with endothelial cells and osteoblasts, provide a specific microenvironment to support hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis. Beta-thalassemia (BT) is an hereditary blood disorder characterized by reduced or absent synthesis of hemoglobin beta-chains. Data on the mesenchymal compartment in BT patients are scarce. We isolated and characterized MSCs from BT and healthy donor (HD) BM samples. BT-MSCs showed a reduced clonogenic capacity, delay in colony formation, lower numbers of CFU-Fs and longer population doubling time. Similarly, we observed an altered differentiation capacity into adipocytes and osteoblasts. Both HD- and BT-MSCs express the canonical mesenchymal markers. On the contrary, the expression of CD146 and CD271 was extremely reduced in BT-MSCs, indicating a pauperization of the most primitive stem cell pool. We analyzed the expression of genes involved in the crosstalk between MSCs and HSCs and found a reduced expression of Cxcl12 , SCF and Angp1 in BT-MSCs. Several genes relevant for MSC functionality were also downregulated in BT-MSCs. We demonstrated that MSCs are able to uptake and store iron. ROS levels were increased in BT-MSCs possibly due to altered anti-oxidant response and iron overload associated with blood transfusions. Importantly, higher level of ROS and reduced expression of primitive markers were observed in HD-MSCs cultured in presence of iron, underlying the importance of iron level for normal MSC function. In conclusion, we showed an impairment in the mesenchymal niche of BT-BM possibly associated with prolonged iron exposure.
