    "abstract_text": "Abstract 5285 INTRODUCTION: The growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), a member of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 superfamily, is thought to be related to ineffective or apoptotic erythropoiesis. GDF-15 levels were found to be significantly elevated in sera of patients with \u03b2 thalassemia major (TM), however little is known about the GDF15 expression during thalassemic erythropoiesis. Non-transfusion dependent thalassemia intermedia (NTDT) represents the model of thalassemic erythropoiesis not affected by transfusions. AIM: To determine the GDF15 gene expression profile during normal and thalassemic erythroid differentiation in standard cultures and under different iron conditions, from CD34 + of normal and thalassemia intermedia subjects. METHODS: After informed consent, the CD34 + cells were obtained from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and from patients with NTDT by positive selection using anti-CD34-tagged magnetic beads and cultured for 14 days with a medium containing stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin 3 (IL-3) and erythropoietin to induce erythroid differentiation. Each culture was split in 3 flasks: standard condition, with addition of deferoxamine (DFO 4 mM) as iron chelating agent and ferric ammonium citrate (FAC 100 mM) at day 0 of culture. The expression profiling of GDF15 gene was evaluated at baseline, day 7 and day 14 by real-time PCR (2\u0302-dCt). GDF15 concentrations in culture supernatants were also evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using DuoSet Sandwich ELISA Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). RESULTS: GDF15 expression and secretion increased significantly during erythroid differentiation either in normal and in NTDT cultures. At day 14 in thalassemia intermedia cultures GDF15 expression as well as the concentrations in supernatant were higher (althoug not statistically significant) compared to control ( Table 1 ). At day 14 in control cultures GDF15 expression is up-regulated by DFO and down-regulated by FAC addition. In NTDT GDF15 expression was influenced by iron addition in cultures, but was not increased by iron depletion ( Table 2 ). Table 1.  . 2\u0302-dCt . pg/mL . Day 0 . Day 7 . Day 14 . Day 7 .

In NTDT cultures the GDF15 gene profile and protein levels in supernatants are higher than in normal cultures. GDF15 levels seem to be modulated by iron in normal cultures whereas in NTDT cultures they seem to be independent from iron availability. This in vitro study supports that signals different than iron, such as erythropoietic stress, could be the major factor regulating GDF15 expression.
