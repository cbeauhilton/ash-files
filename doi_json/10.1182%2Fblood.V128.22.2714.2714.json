    "abstract_text": "Background AML1-ETO (AE), a oncogenic protein generated by the t(8;21) translocation, causes acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in collaboration with other secondary events. The leukemogenicity of AE has been evaluated in multiple mouse models, such as expression of AE in Cdkn1a-null Hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs) and expression of AML1- ETO9a (AE9a), an alternatively spliced variant of AE, in WT HSCs. Both lead to the development of fully penetrant AML. Caspase-3 plays multiple roles in hematopoietic development and leukemia progression and treatment by affecting proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation. It has been shown that uncleaved caspase-3 levels are higher in the peripheral blood cells of AML patients compared to normal individuals, which suggests that the caspase pathway is dysregulated in AML. We and others have shown that Caspase-3 directly cleave AE in vitro , suggesting that AE may accumulate in a Caspase-3 compromised background and accelerate leukemogenesis. Methods We developed a Caspase-3 knockout genetic mouse model of AML based on fetal liver cell transplantation. In brief, fetal liver cells from WT or Caspase3-/- mice were transduced to express AE9a in vitro and 100,000 AE9a+ transduced cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice by tail-vein injection. Results We found loss of Caspase-3 impaired leukemia stem cell (LSC) self-renewal and delayed AE9a-driven leukemogenesis, indicating that Caspase-3 may play distinct roles in the initiation or progression of AML. Moreover, we identified a new substrate of Caspase-3, ULK1, by in vitro cleavage assays and site-directed mutagenesis. ULK1 (serine/threonine UNC-51-like kinase) is the homology of Atg1 (the first autophagy related gene found in 1997) in mammalian cells, which is a direct target of mTOR and is responsible for initiation of the autophagic activity by forming a complex with mAtg13, FIP200 and Atg101. The induction of autophagy caused by upregulation of ULK1 in AE/AE9a-expressing Caspase-3-/- fetal liver cells acted to limit the leukemogenicity of AE9a in vivo . Inhibition of ULK1 by inhibitor or shRNAs could rescue the self-renewal capability induced by Caspase-3 deletion in serial replating assays. Unexpectedly, when we expressed AE/AE9a in fetal liver cells from WT and Caspase-3-/- mice, the protein levels were comparable suggesting the basal level of Caspase-3 didn't affect the expressing of AE/AE9a in fetal liver cells. Conclusion Autophagy may play a general role in the development and treatment of leukemia. In human AML, blasts display reduced expression of autophagy-related genes and decreased autophagic flux, indicating that low autophagy activity provides a general advantage for leukemia development. Beside this, a number of chemotherapy drugs have been reported to be able to induce leukemia cell death via activation of autophagy suggesting that autophagy plays critical roles in the leukemia treatment. Our study reveals that Caspase-3 regulates autophagy through its direct cleavage of ULK1 and this interaction dictates the pace of AE-driven leukemogenesis. Targeting this pathway may have therapeutic benefit for AML treatment. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",
