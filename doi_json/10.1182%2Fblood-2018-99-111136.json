    "abstract_text": "Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Type I (LAD-I) is a severe primary immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent and life-threatening bacterial infections. It is caused by mutations in the ITGB2 gene, encoding the integrin \u03b2 2 common subunit (CD18). These mutations lead to defective or absent expression of \u03b2 2 integrins on leukocyte surfaces, rendering leukocytes unable to extravasate to infection sites. Severe LAD-I is characterized by less than 2% of normal CD18 neutrophil expression and is fatal during the initial 2 years of life in 60-75% of patients in the absence of allogeneic hematopoietic transplant. As it is the case with other monogenic immunodeficiencies, LAD-I is a disorder that could be corrected by ex vivo gene therapy. To this aim we have developed a lentiviral vector (LV) that has recently obtained the Orphan Drug designation (EU/3/16/1753 and DRU-2016-5430). In this LV the expression of hCD18 is driven by a chimeric promoter with a higher activity in myeloid cells. Comprehensive safety and efficacy preclinical LV-mediated gene therapy studies have been conducted in LAD-I mouse models harboring either hypomorphic or knock-out mutations in the ITGB2 gene. Our studies demonstrate stable engraftment of gene corrected LAD-I mouse hematopoietic stem cells in LAD-I recipients and indicate a phenotypic correction of peripheral blood neutrophils. A complete preclinical safety evaluation of the vector was also carried out demonstrating the absence of hematotoxic and genotoxic effects in treated animals. Further studies have been conducted with GMP-produced LVs in human CD34 + cells aimed at optimization of cell transduction. The use of transduction enhancers (TEs) significantly improved the efficacy of genetic correction of human CD34 + cells transduced with LVs at low MOIs. Additionally, transplants into immunodeficient mice showed no changes in the repopulating ability of CD34 + cells when these cells were transduced in the presence of TEs. As occurred in in vitro cultures, significant increases in the transduction of repopulating cells were also associated with the use of TEs, indicating that optimized TE combinations will enable practical and cost-effective transduction of human HSCs in gene therapy protocols. Taken together, these results demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a gene therapy approach directed towards the therapy of LAD-I patients.
